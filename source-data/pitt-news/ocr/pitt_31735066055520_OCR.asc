Ex-spokesman discusses Clinton scandal

Former White House Spokesman Mike McCurry answers questions during

, a press conference before. speaking at Pitt Monday evening. 1

When Mike McCurry was asked

what the number-one role of a.

spokesman is, he immediately replied
that it is essential to remember who
your boss is. _ ‘

Not Bill Clinton, but the people of
the United States. - .

“It’s the only reason why you stand
and answer the questions to begin
with,” said McCurry, explaining that
his role as White House press secretary
was not to defend the president but
rather to inform the American public of
things they needed to know.

McCurry spoke to about 450 of his
former bosses in the William Pitt Union
Monday night. It was his first speaking
engagement after leaving his executive
office post two weeks ago, a position he
had held since January 1995.

Three and a half years, about 550
press conferences and countless “no
comments” later, McCurry made Pitt
the launching pad for his post—White
House career. McCurry chose Pitt as his
“test site” because it was the ﬁrst uni-
versity to ask him to speak, and he said
he heard of Pitt’s “great tradition” from
others in the White House.

Instead of reading the speech he
had prepared, McCurry asked members
of the audience to participate in an
impromptu press conference. Over half
the night was devoted to a question and
answer period open to all, as long lines

formed behind the two microphones.

The questions could have continued

well into the night but ended after an

' hour and 15 minutes.

With questions ranging from cur-
rent global economic crises to the state
of affairs in the Middle East to his
future plans after life in the White
House, questions about the Monica
Lewinsky scandal were inevitably
fielded.

McCur1y’s response was the same
as it has been since the onset of the
media frenzy over Lewinsky.

“I elected to keep myself ignorant
of the details of the [Lewinsky] rela-
tionship,” .McCurry said. He explained
he wanted his money to go toward his
children’s school tuition rather than
legal fees if he were to be subpoenaed
in the Kenneth Starr investigation.

“Sometimes not knowing the
answer is better than not being able to
answer it truthfully,” said McCurry.

McCurry spent a great deal of time
with the president, but purposely kept
himself distant from Clinton’s personal

life. However, he was not devoid of /

opinions regarding the effect the scan-
dal would have on Clinton’s term in
office and the future of American poli-
tics. ' ‘ ‘ '

“I think there will be an ‘asterisk
next to his name in the history books,”
said McCurry. “He will be highly
regarded for presiding over a robust

Recent Oakland visitor wins Nobel Peace Prize  

Jason Gallinger
Asslstant News Editor

The winners of the Nobel Peace
Prize were announced last week,
and one of the men who received
the award recently spoke’ in

. ‘Pittsburgh.

The Nobel Committee gave the

Peace Prize to two men who have .

been instrumental in bringing peace
to Northern Ireland.

David Trimble, leader of the
Ulster Unionist Party, and John
Hume, head of the predominantly
Roman Catholic Social Democratic
Labour Party, will share the nearly
$1 million purse that accompanies
the award. The two had been bitter
enemies in the past but managed to

work together for peace. _

Trimble spoke at the Twentieth
Century Club in Oakland Oct. 9,
during a forum sponsored by the
Irish Institute of Pittsburgh. The
stop here was part of a 12—city tour
designed to drumup American
investment in Northern Ireland.

Trimble and Seamus Mallon, of
the Social Democratic Labour Party,
discussed the Good‘ Friday
Agreement signed on April 10,
which people around the world
hoped would end the Violence in
Northern Ireland.

The agreement created a 108-
member Northern Ireland Assembly
and a 12-member executive com-
mittee comprised of representatives
of the major political parties. The

Assembly will oversee the handling
of local issues. . .

Both menvemphasized the need
for investment in Northern Ireland
to help maintain the stability of the
peace accord. Successful mainte-
nance of the agreement could serve
as an example to other countries
gripped by political turmoil, they
said. ‘

Trimble‘ and Mallon said they

are confident the peace accord will ,

last as long as the Irish Republican
Army does not return to its violent
ways of the past.

Trimble said one of the major
questions that has plagued the peace
process is whether the IRA-has gen-
uinely turned away from violence in
favor of embracing peace.

David Trimble is one of two winners
of the I998 Nobel Peace Prize. He
spoke in Oakland Oct. 9.

A Maxine Hong Kingston reads from a manuscript she almost lost when her

house burned to the ground in 1991. She was the second author to speak
at Pitt as part of the Pittsburgh Contemporary Writers Series.

Author speaks of new
manuscript and visions

Brian Pitts
For The Pitt News

When Maxine Hong Kingston
went back to her house one day sev-
eral years ago, there was nothing
there. Her entire home and the ter-
rain’ around it was charred and
burned.

A devastating Oakland, Calif.,
fire in 1991 had not only destroyed
Kingston’s home, it had also con-
sumed the 156-page manuscript of

the book she_was working on, “The _

Fourth Book of Peace.”

As Kingston surveyed the area,
she imagined it must be what a war
zone looked like. .

“I came out into a changed
world,” she said. 9

It was a vision that helped her to
write her next, currently unpub-
lished book, “The Fifth Book of
Peace,” from which she read
Wednesday night in David
Lawrence Hall. ‘Kingston was the
second author to read in the
Pittsburgh Contemporary Writers
Series, sponsored by Pitt’s English
Writing program. ' ,

Kingston, an American of
Chinese decent, said the title of the
book refers to three legendary tales
she said were burned in one of
China’s historic library fires.‘ “The

Fifth Book of Peace” details
Kingston’s attempts to rush home to
save her manuscript while listening
to a radio report of the fire on her
car radio.

Kingston also had a second
vision that she amused the audience
with. She jokingly claimed that her
father caused the fire, claiming he
wanted her book. When Kingston’s
first book, “Woman Warrior,”
became a success in 1976, she said
her father was jealous.

Many people in the audience
laughed when Kingston said her
mother used to “scold” her father
for not being able to produce any
poems of his own. ’ A

“You used to be a poet. Where
are the poems, poet?” said
Kingston, quoting her mother.

Kingston said her “dramatic
reaction” after the fire left her
unable to read or write. She added
that she believes a major reason the
majority of modern literature is so
depressing is because writing is
such a solitary, personalact.

Kingston eventually decided to
form a writing community, which
has been meeting for approximately
six years. She chose writers with
war experiences to help with her

Christal Hall
Staff Writer

At the time most 7-year-old boys begin
noticing changes in their bodies, Marc
Adams noticed he was attracted to some of
his male friends.

In the back of his mind, he thought it
was wrong, because his father, a f1mdamen—
talist Baptist preacher, taught that homosex-
uality was wrong.

interpret it. ‘

Adams said because of his religious
background he spent most of his childhood
depressed. _

He spoke about the time he and his fam-
ily visited a church in Plymouth, Pa. During
the sermon, he said the preacher claimed
AIDS was God’s way of exterrninating
homosexuals, who were nothing but child
molesters and sexual deviants.

peace book. After writing, the group
members read from their work and
then give feedback to one another in
hopes of bringing out ideas.
Kingston handled questions with
the » same grace and insight she
demonstrated at her readings. When
an audience member asked Kingston

FROM PAGE 2 .

what advice she would give to the
United Nations in dealing with
Yugoslavia, Kingston said every-
body must remember that although
individual actions may not be able
to stop a war right away, “Our acts
toward peace may stop a war in 40
years, or a thousand years.”
Kingston is not only a major
American writer, she has also been
quoted as the most formidable

Asian—American writer in American
history. Through experience and
family myth, her work illustrates the
Chinese immigrant experience.
Among Kingston’s published
works are two books of nonfiction,
“The Woman Warrior: Memoirs of a
Girlhood Among Ghosts,” which
won the National Book Critics
Circle Award for Nonfiction and
was also one of Time magazine’s

Top—10 nonfiction works of the
decade. She» also wrote “China
Men,” as well as the novel
“Tripmaster Monkey.”

Lynn Emanuel, director of the
English Writing program at Pitt,
said the Writers Series revolves
around a central theme.

“All of the visiting writers are
people who write in more than one

economy  and it will be a true legacy,
that will always be stained.” ‘ ’
After a moment’s pause, the crowd
erupted in laughter to McCurry’s obvi-
ous pun on Lewinsky’s infamous blue
semen-stained dress.
’ This is-one example of McCurry’s

delight invthe fact that he no longer has

to be as cautious in the way he handles

political affairs. At one. point, McCurry

jumped in the air, arms extended, shout-'
ing, “free at last.”

“Humor is a necessary part to life in
Washington,” McCurry said. “A lot of
times just to deal with the craziness you
had to do something crazy.” V

As assistant to the president,
McCurry saw both the positive and neg-
ative sides of journalism today and how
it directly affected America’s view of
the presidency. A

“Most journalists say that you need

w.~..yw.»~wvm¢.;o- -

to get it first and you need to get it
right,” McCurry said regarding joumal-

_ist ethics of the past. However, he was

quick to point out that today it is, “most
important to get it first.”

Not only did he express concern
about how the _news’was reported, but
he also commented on the events that
were being under—reported.

“Of course it was ‘frustrating. There

. were so many days thatl wanted to talk

about the problem of Kosovo,” said
McCurry, referring to the turmoil in the
Serbian province. “Literally I was
stunned whennobody would ask about
this.” x

The other most talked-about com-
ponent was the state of the global econ-
omy and its effect on the United States

_ both now and in the future. McCurry

believes that Clinton should get the
bragging rights for the strength of the
economy in the United States. He went
on to say that if it wasn’t for the stabil-
ity of the American economy right now,

events in South East Asia and Latin
America would have an even more
detrimental effect on the state of affairs
in this country.

“I think the decisions that presi-
dents make have huge consequences on
the macro-economic scene of the coun—
try,” McCurry said.

Due. to the Lewinsky turmoil,

'Clinton’s eﬂ"ectiveness in Tofﬁce has

been in question. While McCurry does-
n’t deny the factthat Clinton will not be
ableto. retain as good a standing as he

did prior to_ the scandal,’ he believes that .

Clinton.will not be the lame-duck pres-
ident others predict he will be in the

7 next two years. In fact, McCurry feels
that Clinton’s eﬁectiveness has been ..

evident in the recent strides to increase
the amount of teachers in the public
school system as well to expand fund-

ing for the International Monetary.

Fund.
VV1th the diverse crowd in atten-
dance, ranging from Democrats to

Republicans, Japanese-Americans to
Lebanese-Americans and freshman stu-
dents to senior citizens, the response to
McCurry’s appearance was just as var-

.ied as the people in attendance.

“I still think that [McCurry] artfully
dodged around questions,” said Lauren
Daniel, a Pitt junior. “I guess _that’s
because he is still used to speaking in
front of news reporters and not with
members of the community.”

Jason Shedlock, a second-year stu-

. dent -in..Pitt»’s Graduate School of Public
and International Affairs, had a*differ-

ent opinion.
“I think he did an excellent job,”
said Shedlock, who felt McCurry did

his best to not put any spin into his .
, responses. _ I

McCurry looks forward to interact-
ing with the academic community and
is thinking about ﬁnding a place to

teach. He will more than likely contin-p

ue to do some consulting in the private
political sector as well. ‘

Removal of transitional program
cr step in right direction

Due to the increasing num-
ber of applicants and the limited
amount of. space available for
incoming students, the
University of Pittsburgh has

decided‘ to eliminate its Summer

Transitional Education Program.

STEP is a program designed to
"help applicants with low SAT

scores or low grades, who have
the potential to do well, prepare
for college.

As a University seeking to
make headway on the academic
circuit, improve the quality of its
students and raise its admissions

standards, removing a‘transition- '

al program for marginal students
is a good idea. If Yale, Harvard
or even some of the major public
universities don’t have programs’
like this one, why should Pitt?
Though the STEP program
does give marginally accepted
students a chance to do well in
college by giving them a solid
start, it is a program that could
potentially turn away a more
qualiﬁed student in favor of the
marginal student, considering
Pitt’s limited space. Programs
for disabled and foreign students
should still be offered, but pro-
grams for students whose only
problem is a slight incompeten-
cy in, math or English composi-

tion are simply not necessary.

. Everyone deserves a chance
to succeed, but STEP is not the
way to’do'it. If a student with

marginal grades wants to attend’

college but can barely meet
Pitt’s admissions criteria, the
student should enroll at one of
Pitt’s branch campuses, a col-
lege with lower admissions stan-
dards or a community college. If

they have potential, they will

prove themselves by getting
good grades .and as a result will

‘ be able to transfer to Pitt’s main '

campus.

STEP, a requirement for
marginal students before they
enter their freshman year, teach-
es math and English composi-
tion skills — skills students
should have picked up in high
school. Disabled students and
foreign students with high
grades but limited English skills

’ should still be helped, but help

should not be given to high
school graduates who have trou-

ble remembering their basic.

algebra.

If these students are not
ready to come to college, they
are -not ready to come to college.

There should be no need for

STEP for a college with high
academic aspirations.

THE P111 NEWS: OPINIONS‘ *

  Another niglﬂeﬂ lhe opera

POEM BY ERIC ANDERSON

there is a profuse wisdom that accompanies the
expansion of human experience. whether it be poverty or
toil, drug addled consciousness or zen like euphoria,
there is something to be spoken for the mad hatter when
all is said and done.

the night sun ebbs on the clouded tide of chaotic
urbanism. the clotted arteries of sprawl and coughing
commerce lead home the dead. vacant, null and void,

‘ destined to play out pitiful games of nostalgic reminders.

here, in a loosely crowded bar—cafe, sit the new
bohernians. rapt in their quixotical stares, sipping on the
glass rims of their coffees and stout draught beers.‘ they
are the new generation of revolutionaries.

no, you’ve got it wrong, this isn’t the sixties. there
will be no conﬂict, no banter about the disfunction of a
myopic society. there will be no chicago seven, no hell’s
angels at altamont, no bra burning or belligerent free
speech movement. the new revolutionaries play the rev-
olutionary game in a new way. they don’t do anything.

no they’re not the slackers either...that concept was
trite, a sociological assumption based on the lack of
material concern held by an exponentially small faction

p of american young. no, these new .

revolutionaries will want things, they just don’t want
what you want.

they are the truth seers, the people whose sight has
transcended the indoctrinating forces of the advertising
beast. they have not been taken in by huge boss and

calvin klein. they have been taken in by the rapture and
well being that can inundate the soul when an individual
does whatever in the hell it pleases.

bouncing now, down the merry, drunken path of
bleeding night sun, we travel to a ﬂop house, sullied by
the drone of a windowfan, drawn in by the perfumatic
scents of opium and blunt and marijuana. legs and feet
and heads and bodies bounce to the beats of organ jazz
funk. legends are born this way. oozing in to the com-
fortable, disgusting couch, so hideous and odorous, yet
so sweet to sleep on, there is a hum, almost a bumble in
the stench smoked room. the beats and the drugs are
coming alive, and the new peoples are rapping and
rolling and hitting and coughing all the way down to the
merry hairy toes on their own funked feet. this is how
genius is born.

speaking and reading dank poetry from the halls of
poverty to the shores of turmoil. kneading the thoughts

of raw angry minds, whose beautiful content can be-
’found so disturbing by mother and father, sister, piggy,

boyfriend/girlfriend, square, brother and impoverished
gentryman. not the new revolutionaries though, they find
the prophecies of pundits (john and luke and moses) to
be so oversimpliﬁed that there utility has ceased to be
fortuitous. they sit and dig the jive hand mouth lips ﬂow
tongue over syllable after syllable of raw english word
spoken jazz, to go with the organ jazz funk, now synthe-
sizing in a rare moment of mind addled drug under-
standing. art and art married together for the world to
abhor, simply put, because it would take a rise in the
sheets to understand. but the new revolutionaries, they
understand, but they don’t do anything. this is how i was
born.

Eric

Anderson

Last year I was confronted by a scrap-
py young punk who thought he could

write. His name was Kevin Carey, and for ,
some reason our minds locked onto a new ~

notion of what it means to be alive in
Pittsburgh. We were both too juvenile to
really understand the implications of our
thoughts. We’d spend late nights shucking
responsibility and devoting whims to
excess and drunken merriness. We have
matured since then, however. We have
realized the importance of the journey, and
we have made a pledge to embark across
life on the raft of perception. So I invite
all who have taken something from my

,poem (and last_week’s urban poem by

Kevin Carey), to send us any good drugs
that may be laying around. If there’s one
thing I’ve learned, it’s that the proper
amount of narcotics will liven up any
mundane affair. Even if it is a night at the
opera.

Two reminders in closing: The path
you’re traveling on should always be your
own,- and cheese is best when served from
a can.

Eric Anderson and Kevin Carey may be the
same brain divided into two bodies —— one
an Irish Catholic drunk and the other just
a drunk. -

Panthers need to
learn some
work ethic  

Hard work.

It will make a person successful in
life, ‘and it’s one of the many factors that
will help athletic’ teams win games and
championships. ‘

Unfortunately, it’s a quality missing
from some of Pitt’s sports teams lately.

Last" year’s Pitt football team had less
talent than many of the teams it played, but
it made up for its lack of talent with heart
and determination. The seniors led the
team and reminded the rest of the squad
that the class of 1998 had not had a win-
ning season at Pitt before last year.

That attitude carried the Panthers to

a g their ﬁrst bowl game in nine years. This

year’s team does not have the same ﬁre,
and they are not as successful. Last year’s
emotion seems to be gone. Where did it
go?

It’s hard to say, but it must have left
with the hardest workers Pitt football has
seen in a while: Pete Gonzalez, Billy West,
Dwayne Schulters, John Jenkins and the
rest of last year’s seniors.

The Panthers need to snap out of their
funk and watch some tape from last year.

‘ Last season’s squad had a magical year,

and that is still not outside the realm of
possibility this year. (Remember what
everyone was thinking when Pitt lost to
Temple last year?). .

This year’s team needs a leader, and
that player needs to step step forward
soon. The Panthers are 2-4 and in last

. place in the Big East. Someone needs to

take control of this team and motivate the
players to work harder than they have ever

' worked.

The Panthers work hard every year in
summer camp, they work hard every week
in practice and they ‘work hard in their
classes. But that work ethic has not trans-
ferred to the ﬁeld on Saturdays.

The only time Pitt looked like a team
ready to challenge anything was against
Penn State. The Panthers need to find that
ﬁre,_ bottle it up .and let it go every
Saturday. 1'

Pittsburgh’s pro football team has

shown what a great work ethic can do. The
Steelers have no offense this year, but the
defense keeps plugging away and winning
football games. ' ‘.

To let the football team off the hook, ’

the same thing happened to the basketball’
team last year. The team had a great deal of
talent, but did not do what it takes to win.
The basketball team rested-on its tal-
ent alone. The team didn’t work hard to do

The men’s and women’s swimming
teams met on Saturday morning for their
ﬁrst meet. The humid atmosphere of Trees
Hall played host to the annual Blue and

Blue sinking Gold, 159.5-114.5.

Women lose two games

Brad Cuprik

Staff Wrlter

After running into some tough com-
petition over the weekend, two losses left
the women’s soccer team below .500 with
just three games remaining in the season.

Pitt lost the crucial Big East games at
Seton Hall Friday and at Connecticut
Sunday. ‘

Kelly Smith, a forward for Seton
Hall, defeated the Panthers single—hand-
edly by scoring all four goals for the
Pirates. Those four goals tied the single-
game school scoring record Smith set last
season against the Panthers.‘The junior
striker scored twice on breakaways in
3:31 at the end of the ﬁrst half, giving
Seton Hall a 2-0 lead. ’

The Panthers’ single bright spot came
with just ﬁve seconds remaining in the

. first half, when Charity McClure centered

a pass to midﬁelder Charity Kriley, who
scored on a shot from just inside the box
to cut the Pirates’ lead in half. It was
Kriley’s second goal of the season.
Smith added two more goals in the
second half, one on_ a breakaway and one
from 15 feet away on a blast. The

Panthers were out-shot 18-12 in the
game. The 4-1 ﬁnal score dropped Pitt to
7-7 and 5-4 in the conference.

Sunday’s trip to Connecticut to take
on the fourth-ranked Huskies was one to
forget. The Panthers were defeated 6-0 on
the scoreboard and worse on the ﬁeld.
UConn remained unbeaten in 15 contests
by pressing the Pitt defense all day and
not allowing Pitt to pose any scoring
threats.

The Panthers did not even register a
shot during the game, while allowing 33
to the Huskies. Midﬁelder Margaret
T ietjen led the attack by scoring twice and
recording an assist. Also scoring for
UConn were Chiisy McCarm,‘ Casey
Zinmy, Jana Carabino and Jen Laccone.

The women’s soccer team has now ‘i

lost three games in a row, six of its past
eight, to drop to 7-8 with a 5-5 record in
the Big East. Two of the three remaining
games are against non-conference oppo-

nents Robert Morris and Old Dominion. -_ ~

That leaves the season-ending contest
with West Virginia on Halloween mom-
ing a key matchup for the Panthers — a
win could solidify their hopes for a ﬁrst—

. ever berth in the Big East playoffs.

FROM PAGE 7

At the end of the first half, Seton
Hall struck again when Brian Cuddy
scored from inside the box on a feed
from A.J. Panas to put the Pirates ahead

'2-1.

At the start of the second half,
Pittsburgh came out with a lot of offen-
sive pressure, stunning the Seton Hall
defenders. The Panthers were ﬁnally
rewarded for their relentless efforts
when Kopp capitalized on a rebound
from the comer, scoring in the 51st
minute to knot the game at 2-2.

Pittsburgh was the next to strike
and this time took the lead. Matilla was
set nicely on a centering pass across the
box from Chad-Porter, easily sinking

his shot past goalkeeper Derek Martin.’

This score in the 73rd minute gave

Pittsburgh the lead for the first time in
the game.

The lead didn’t last long. In the
78th minute, Seton Hall scored what
would be the ﬁnal goal of the contest,
when Peter Scavo headed the ball past’
goalkeeper Mike Norris off a 30 yard
throw-in fromteammate Brian Ruth.

Through the two scoreless over-
times, Seton Hall put on a lot of pres-
sure and nearly missed on a shot that
rolled across the goal face in the first
overtime. 0 ‘

“It was a goodeffort,” Luxbacher

said. “There were a couple of bad goals ‘

but the guys played hard.”
Kopp believes there really wasn’t

that much of a change in preparing for

this weekend’s matchups.

“There was nothing really different;
[in practices] we had more work on the
turf, which seemed to help us,” he said.

 N FROM PAGE 7

the little things,.such as box out or deny the
basketball on every, play, causing the
Panthers to lose some games they should-
n’t have.

Some of this was due to the fact that
the team was young and inexperienced,

but anyone can box. The players just have:

to put a body between their men and the
ball. Simple.

’-9 These things take hard work, and the
basketball team has to be prepared to work
hard this year if it expects to win.

These two teams need to put on their

hard hats and play like they are from

’ Pittsburgh —-— a blue collar town that loves

hard workers,inot fancy players.

The basketball team has a little more
time to do this, but it is not too late for the
football team to turn things around either.
Both teams need to forget about the past.
Take the awards off the wall, and try to win
new ones to put up there.

,Don’t‘ rest on your laurels, Pan_thers,
get out there and make this school proud.

The Pitt News and is willing to lend his
hard hat to any player who needs it to get
the job done.
