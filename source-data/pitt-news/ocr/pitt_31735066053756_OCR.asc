Campus shocked
in wake of
iunior's death

Nora O'Neill
Staff Writer

Students across Pitt's campus are mourning the loss of
fellow student Ryan Steppacher. Steppacher, a junior, was
traveling back to campus from his Luzeme County home
Sunday afternoon when he and his sister, Erin Steppacher,
a Duquesne freshman, were involved in a two-vehicle
accident.

According to state police in Hazleton, Steppacher lost
control of his vehicle while driving along Interstate 80 in
Butler Township. The car spun out of control, crossing the
median and the path of an oncoming tractor trailer.

The Steppachers, neither
_ of whom were wearing seat
belts, were both thrown from
the car. Ryan's sister and the
truck driver were treated and
released from the Penn State
Geisinger Medical Center in
Danville. Ryan Steppacher
was pronounced dead at the
scene at 3:30 p.m. on Sunday.
Steppacher was well-
known on Pitt's Oakland cam-
pus as an active member of the
rugby team and as a brother of
the Phi Gamma Delta, more
commonly known as Fiji, fra-
ternity.

Many of his friends; teammates and fraternity broth-
ers were affected by Steppacher's death and commented
on their loss. Dave Misolek, the Rugby Club president,
spoke for himself and his teammates:

"We are all really upset," Misolek said. "As a team,
we lost a teammate. It's not a good scene. The team is get-
ting together to go to the viewing and funeral." ‘

Rugby Head Coach Dan Talbert discussed the steps
the team will be taking to preserve Ryan Steppacher's
memory. Already, ofﬁcials on the team are establishing an
annual athletic award in Ryan's name.

"We are either going to wear an armband or have
patches made, in addition to the Ryan Steppacher Awar ,"
he said. "In 10 years, people are going to look back and
say ‘This guy must have been something,‘ and he was."

While the rugby team was considering canceling its
game this weekend — coincidentally its last match of the
season — Talbert announced that the team will indeed
play.

"We are going to play out the season this weekend at
CMU. That's what Ryan would have wanted," Talbert
said.

Ryan's high—school football coach, Tony Cantaﬁo,
echoed Talbert's feelings in the Scranton Times Tribune.
"He had heart," said Cantafio. "To me, he epitomized that

The newest presidential candidates on allocations...

Catching up to the up and running

Six new candidates join late in the race for SGB

Lisa Grzyboski

Senior Staff Writer

The Student Government
Board election race is on and the
competition is heating up as six
new candidates have stepped off
the sidelines and joined the all-
out sprint toward the goal of
being on the next CAS under-
graduate Student Government
Board.

Presidential candidates
Alyson Wallach, Trey Billips and
Shannon McCabe, and three new
board candidates, Geoff Broz,
Steve Valsamidis and Mike
Friedberg, have officially
declared their entrance into this
year’s SGB election race, accord-
ing to Chris Boback, the SGB
elections committee chair. The
candidates’ advertising campaign

began on Tuesday and elections
are slated for Nov. 5. ,

Only two students
Allocations Committee chairman
Gerald Klayman and current
SGB member David Teeters -
declared their presidential candi-
dacy by the Oct. 6 deadline set by
the SGB’ elections committee.
Fourteen others also initiated
their run for the eight available
board positions since the deadline
for primary candidates was
armounced.

In the past two weeks, how-
ever, a handful of students decid-
ed to enter the election as sec-
ondary candidates for both the
presidency and the board.

As secondary candidates, the
students followed the same appli-
cation procedure as primary can-
didates, but, because of their late

election entrance, were required
to secure additional student sig-
natures: 250 more for president
and 200 more for board.

Primary presidential candi-
dates must receive 150 signatures
and primary board candidates
must obtain 100.

The decision to run for SGB
president was difficult for
McCabe, Billips and Wallach, all
of whom have worked in the
SGB ofﬁce and have experienced
their share of ups and downs on
the sixth ﬂoor of the William Pitt
Union. McCabe is a former mem-
ber of the allocations board,
Billips was freshmen council
president three years ago and
served on the governmental rela-
tions committee. Wallach co-
chaired the Pitt Project this year

PPC summons a psychic

Hocus—pocus, crystal balls and
gypsy garb. That is what the students
who ﬁlled the Assembly Room of
the University's William Pitt Union
expected last night, but that’s not
exactly what they got.

Kasandra, who does not use her
last name when she performs,

appeared in the student union to give
a lecture on psychic abilities. She
also promised free personal readings
at the conclusion of the lecture.
Speaking before the perfor-
mance, Lisa Pfeifer, the director of
leisure learning for the Pitt Program
Council, discussed Kasandra’s role
in the PPC’s Halloween Fun Fest.
“Kasandra was referred to us
through a telenetwork. Her lecture is

for students

being paired with the PPC’s show-
ing of the movie Scream,” Pfeifer
said. “These activities are designed
to get people in the Halloween
mood.”

Before the lect11re got under
way, numerous students discussed
their reasons for attending the lec-
ture. Debbie Obligacion, a sopho-
more, was excited about Kasandra’s

Dow rebounds over 330
points after dramatic fall

Across the Nation

NEW YORK —-— You lose 550 points
one day, you gain most of it back the
next, and you've got the makings of a
wild ride on Wall Street.

Traders who were reeling from the
market's worst-ever point loss yester-
day are again trying to catch their
breath -— after a day of hectic buying
that left the Dow with its biggest—ever
gain of more than 333 points.

It was a tumultuous end to the trad-
ing day on Wall Street as traders erupt-
ed into cheers and threw their trading
tickets into the air at the sound of the
closing bell.

That was the second celebration in
an hour —— the first one came when
trading volume broke the 1—billion—
share barrier, easily setting another
record.

WASHINGTON — Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright says the summit
between President Clinton and Chinese
President Jiang Zernin will be "candid
and comprehensive."

Albright also says it's not going to
be a "one—issue summit" and that the
issue of human rights won't be allowed

- to dominate the talks.

She says she's encouraged that
three American religious leaders have
been invited to China to talk about
human rights. But, even with the ges-
ture, Albright is disappointed that
Beijing hasn't freed dissidents before
the summit.

CAPITOL HILL — A proposed con-
stitutional amendment on religious
freedom has cleared one hurdle —— but
many more remain.

On a party-line vote, the House
Judiciary's Constitution Subcommittee
has approved the measure to prohibit
religion—based discrimination by gov-
ernments and the courts. Action by the
full committee is expected next spring.

The measure would have to be
approved by two-thirds of the House
and Senate and be ratified by three-
fourths of the states to be added to the
Constitution. '

Supporters say it would ban gov-
ernments from requiring participation
in religious activities and prescribing
school prayers. But opponents —
including Democrats — say it would
allow funding for religious schools.

MAYVILLE, N.Y. — Authorities in
New York say a man infected with the
AIDS virus kept a list of names of those
he'd had sex with.

They say Nushaw Williams was
"some kind of scorekeeper" who talked

young women into having sex with
him. Officials say Williams slept with
at least 10 teenage girls —-— the youngest
of them only 13 years old.

New York Sate officials also say
Williams has turned over the names of
50 to 75 women.

Nine cases of HIV infection have
been conﬁrmed in the rural western
New York area of Chautauqua County
—— some 70 miles south of Buffalo.

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. — A
Massachusetts jury may begin deliber-
ating today on the fate of a British
nanny.

Nineteen-year-old Louise
Woodward is accused of killing an 8-
month-old boy in her care, a charge
she’s denied on the stand.

Closing arguments are set to begin
today.

The judge has already given the
jurors an all-or—nothing option. They
can consider verdicts only on ﬁrst— or
second-degree murder charges —-— and
not on a lesser charge of manslaughter.

BALTIMORE — A Joppa company
unveiled new emergency brakes that
allow tractor trailers to stop quickly
without jackkniﬁng.

The auxiliary brakes clamp on top
of the back tires and prevent the vehi-
cles from jackknifing on wet surfaces
and steep grades. The trucks stop in
only 160 feet.

George Percy Jr., the 77-year old
inventor of the system, is vice president
of research and development for
Emergency Brake Technologies
Incorporated of Joppa. The company
hopes to install the auxiliary brakes in
rigs worldwide; each system costs
about $3,900.

EBT expects to make its first sale
within the next month.

Around the World

PERTH, Australia — Two men surf-
ing off a beach in south Australia are
lucky to be alive after meeting a shark
up close and personal.

They say they were paddling on a
surfboard when a 16-foot shark
attacked and chomped on the board.
One of the men told Australian radio
the shark barely missed his foot as it bit
the board in half.

The men were thrown into the
water, but other paddlers rescued them
before the shark could attack a second
time.

The shark was believed to be a
great white.

Socialists recruit among the people at Pitt  

James Maude

Staff Wrlter

Across the globe, socialist organiza-

tions take to the streets in an attempt to
recruit new members and to talk with peo-
ple about the major principles of socialism.
Here at Pitt, two such groups do just that as
well.

Emily and Charlene, who preferred
not to give their last names, regularly set up
tables outside the Hillman Library and the
William Pitt Union. At their tables, they sell
subscriptions to the Socialist Workers Party
newspaper, The Militant, and other socialist
literature.

"It's a great way to meet students inter-
ested in discussing world politics," said
Emily.

"It's a way for us to get people to be
part of the struggles that are going on,"
Charlene added

Particular issues they address with
their tables and materials include the U.S.
embargo on Cuba, the death of Jonny
Garnmage, abortion rights and N/5£PO's
involvement in the Balkan states.

They also hold regular forums and
actively support the Socialist Workers‘
1997 campaign, which includes Edwin

Fruit's run for mayor and Leroy Watson's
candidacy for Pittsburgh City Council's 6th
District

Another socialist group that actively
tries to gain students‘ attention on campus is

presentation and cited her own beliefs in
psychic phenomena and her psychic abili-
ties.

“I’m a real believer,” Obligacion said.
“I’ve gone to psychics before, and I have
used tarotcards.Ithinkthereare somereal
psychics out there.”

Kasandra appeared on the stage at 8:30
p.m. in rather nondescript clothing. There
was nothing in her appearance reminiscent
of movies’ portrayal of psychics — no hoop
earrings or peasant blouses for her.
Kasand1a’s look drove home the point of
her lecture, which focused on the universal-
ity of the psychic abilities.

“I think all of us have psychic abilities
to some degree.” said Kasandra.

After her brief lecture, Kasandra had
those attending the event get into circles
and then gave each of the groups a num-
bered envelope containing objects. She told
them to pass the envelope around the circle
and to try to pick up on the feelings they
sensed or the images they saw while hold-
ing it.

Kasandra then collected the envelopes
and asked each group about the images or
feelings they had sensed.

She next opened the envelopes, whose
contents — such as $2 bills or pieces of
blue fabric — revealed whether the group
had predicted what the item inside was.

Kasandra often made connections
between one—word adjectives like "ol " or
"warm" to conclude that audience mem-
bers had correctly guess the envelopes‘ con-
tents.

After Kasandra opened the last enve-
lope, she ended her lectrne — except for

four lucky students who were selected for a

"private psychic reading with her.

Aside from these four students, the
majority of those at the lecture seemed dis-
appointed by it.

Junior Karen Hykys was expecting
more fromvKasandra. “I thought she would
do some public readings,” Hykys said.

Freshman Justin Blott was skeptical of
Kasandra's abilities.

“People could have said anything
about those envelopes, and she would have
twisted it around. to ﬁt what was insi ,”
Blott commented. “I have a hunch she had
no idea what she was talking about.”

Melissa Meinzer, a freshman, agreed
with Blott. “Her main talent was just draw-
ing tenuous links between very vague
things.”

Despite these students‘ criticism of

Kasandra's performance, those who
received private readings ‘ from her
expressed their ﬁrm belief in her abilities.
Jen Justus, a senior, was one of the four to
enjoy a personal session.

“She was right on shot with my read-
ing. She told me things about my relation-
ship with my boyfrien " Justus said.

"She asked me why we pick on each
other so muc " and "was right on with that
question," Justus added. The senior con-
cluded, “Her speech was a bit ambiguous,
but after the reading, I really believe.”

Julie Heenan, a sophomore, also
received a personal reading.

“She was very insightful," said
Heenan. “She knew I wanted to teach, and
she knew about my brother’s upcoming
marriage. I never believed in psychics.”

Now, Heenan thinks dilferently.

CANDIDATES

after an unsuccessful vie for a board
position in last year's election.

But their professed love of Pitt and a
strong desire to see the students get the
most out of their four years at the
University urged the three candidates to
dive head-first into the election process.
All are using platforms focused on
improving student life and Pitt pride to
stay aﬂoat in a race that could prove to
come right down to the wire.

“At this point, it is important to

reach as many students as possible in ‘

order to convince them who would make
the best president,” Wallach said. “Right
now, we all have a better chance of los-
ing. The students have more things to
look at and they are being given more
choices, more issues and more things to
think about.”

Running independently of any slate
on a platform focusing on communica-
tion and Pitt pride, Wallach is deter-
mined to use her “personal experiences
and developed leadership skills” to her
beneﬁt.

“As president of the Blue and Gold
Society and in working with students
and alumni, I have realized how very
important it is that students not only
graduate with a world-class education,”
the senior said, “but that they leave feel-
ing Pitt is a world—class University.”

Billips, a Pitt senior and also a mem-
ber of the Blue and Gold Society, said
the three main points of his platform are
"communication, teamwork and unity."

"We are all united in the fact that we
all chose to come to the University of
Pittsburgh," Billips said.

He said he wants to reach out to the
student body and have them bring their
problems and concerns to the memebers
of the student government board.
Particularly, he said, those who feel they
aren't being properly represented.

He wants to continue with the pre-

THE PITT NEWS

FROM PAGE 1

sent administration's concept of a Pitt-
Proud community.

"I want to work with the athletic
department to get the students to attend
more games," Billips said. "This under-
lies the idea of creating Pitt pride on
campus."

McCabe, heading the slate entitled
“A Better Campus,” including board
candidates Valsamidis and Friedberg,
also incorporated a bit of school spirit
into her campaign.

“I want to work towards getting a
concrete object of Pitt’s identity on cam-
pus,” she said. “A statue of a panther
would be a unifying symbol of Pitt
Panther pride. Ideally, I would really like
to put it in the center of Bigelow
Boulevard. But practically, it can ﬁt
nicely in front of the Union on the lawn.
Something like this is a great identiﬁca-
tion of a college campus.”

As one of the 10 resigning members
of the SGB Allocations Committee last
month, McCabe said she nevertheless
has faith in the allocations system.

“My whole view on what was going
on was that SGB leadership was at fault.
There are a few things that need to be
ironed out in the [allocations] process,
but I don’t know how feasible it is in
separating SGB from the allocations
committee as some candidates have sug-
gest .”

Wallach attributes communication
barriers to the resignation of the
Allocations Committee board members
and the accusations hurled at SGB for
alleged misuse of student activities
funds.

“What I think the problem was this
year was a lack of communication with-
in the board and direct communication
from the board to the students,” she said.
“Students were indirectly linked to SGB
through The Pitt News or other sources.
One of my ideas is to have a weekly col-

umn in the newspaper, or if that’s not
feasible, to bring back the SGB brief -
a readable, informative version of the
minutes from SGB meetings.”

Billips said Pitt's allocations system
is stable, but that it is up to the elected
board members to put effective and qual-
iﬁed people on the committee. He also
considers allocations to be a major part
of the University.

"Communication" is the buzz-word
among all three new board candidates.
Advocating open communication and
cooperation among SGB and student
organizations, Valsamidis is focusing his
campaign on campus life, especially
regarding the issues of student integra-
tion and residence life.

“I’m working on designing a laun-
dry‘ service on campus,” he said, com-
menting on a speciﬁc campaign point. “I
have spoken to a couple departments on
campus and I think a package deal for
students is possible.”

Friedberg, one of Valsamidis’ run-

ning partners, won’t be delving into the
laundry issue, but he will be looking at
the issue of expanding the Sunday
evening library and Schenley Cafe oper-
ating hours as well as the campus shuttle
service.

“I just have questions that I think I
can answer,” the sophomore board can-
didate said. “I’m interested in helping
the students.”

Broz, meanwhile, has vowed that he
will pursue “aggressive research into
ﬁnding out what the students want and
are interested in,” should he be elected.

’ This campaign promise comple-
ments his focus on a student activities
fee voucher system which will allow stu-
dents to directly decide how their money
is used rather than placing all the deci-
sions in the hands of the SGB
Allocations Committee.

“I’m concerned with allocations and
the way things are done structurally,” he
said. “I want to reduce the inﬂuence of
SGB on allocations.”

team."

Ryan's fraternity brothers were also
shaken by their loss. Fiji brother Ryan
Murray discussed the feelings of his fra-
ternity and their plans to attend
Steppacher's funeral, which is to be held
on Thursday morning in Scranton.

"Ryan was a great guy, and he will
be very missed," Murray said. "Almost
the whole house is planning to attend his
funeral."

Christa Douaihy, a junior and mem-
ber of Pitt's Student Government Board,
grew up with Steppacher and tried to
explain the kind of person he was.

"Ryan lived a few blocks away from
me in Scranton. We grew up together. I
can't explain the loss so many people
must be feeling. He was such a popular
and great kid," Douaihy said.

"He was a strong person. He went
through a lot of tough times and had

FROM PAGE 1

really gotten himself on track."

Joe Cummings Jr. of Roaring Brook
Township was a close friend of Ryan
since childhood. He spoke to the
Scranton Times Tribune about his friend
and the disbelief he felt when he heard
the news.

"I didn't believe it at ﬁrst, and I kept
thinking it wasn't true," said Cummings.
"He was like a brother to me."

Cummings related the feelings of
those in their hometown who were clos-
est to Steppacher: "He was very loyal.
He would have done anything for his
friends."

A memorial service for Ryan
Steppacher will be held at the Fiji fra-
ternity house at 4725 Wallingford St. in
North Oakland on Sunday at 5 p.m. All
are invited.

Experts say the U.S. economy is strong and that the rather

alarm —— concem, perhaps —— but not alarm. We’re told that
ours is still a bull market, and that there is no reason for panic.

But panic is exactly what everybody did. Panic is why
the market fell. Panic was the result of a brmch of scared peo-
ple who reacted and didn’t make much sense in doing so.

Stock prices fall when a company is doing poorly, or
when people are selling more than they are buying. When. a
market falls 7 percent in one day ——- having fallen for several
days before that ——- and experts assure us that the economy is
still strong, that means that people were selling their stock.

Why did they sell their stock? Because they panicked

Hong Kong’s market fell sharply last Thursday by more
than 10 percent When investors saw this, they saw people
selling stock in a foreign market They watched another mar-
ket appear to destabilize and so they sold shares in other mar-
kets.

America’s market dropped the same day. European mar-
kets slumped Japan’s market fell. All this, because people
were scared And it continued

People were so scared that Monday, the U.S. market took
its 12th-largest dive in history.

Trouble in foreign markets is no reason to get scared and

sell hastily in domestic ones. But that’s what people did Wall
Street responded by actually shutting down early Monday, a

safeguard to stop the massive ﬂux of stock being sold in a
panic. It closed long enough for people to regain their heads.
These safeguards also closed the market for a half-hour ear-
lier in the day. But as soon as the break was over, people went
back to their frantic, panic-induced selling. Apparently, the
pause just wasn’t long enough for people to start thinking
rationally.

Investors’ frantic responses were catalyzed by a string of
events which began several months ago in Southeast Asia.

7 Asian markets were looking unstable, and international
speculators borrowed baht, the Thai currency. Expecting the
baht to devalue, they sold it for American currency so they
could buy the baht back at a proﬁt if it did lose ground. They
tried to make an effortless proﬁt, and that angered Thai1and’s
government, which raised short—term interest rates to almost
300 percent —— making it harder for these speculators to prof-
it. When interest rates are ﬂiat high, it becomes all that much
harder for any economy to prosper.

Still, the U.S. market shouldn’t have taken such a drastic
plunge — that is, if we hadn’t panicked.

Hey creatures of the night : Unite!

It’s Halloween time again: a
time for foreign marketers to make
a whole lot of money selling really
scary costumes of creatures like
vampires, the reanirnated dead and
Tammy Faye Baker. The really sad
aspect of this holiday blitz is that the
Tammy Faye costume probably
sells the most these days (and,
arguably, really is the scariest).

Monsters, as a class of human-
like beings, just aren’t as scary as
they usedto be when we were kids.

POINT/COUNTERPOINT

Citizens and police should all
welcome civilian review board

Heather
Barnett

It’s a mid-October night. You’re
alone, driving a car you borrowed from
your cousin. You see a police car in your
rear view mirror. You pull over.

Seven minutes later, the breath has
been beaten out of your body. You die on
the street, suffocated, as the coroner later
determines, through pressure applied to
your back and neck. Your life is over
after just 31 years. All because you, a
black man, made the fatal mistake of dri-
ving a Jaguar through Brentwood.

The killing of Ionny Garnmage is
but one of the more high—proﬁle exam-
ples of police brutality in America. It is
far from the only one. Abner Louima, a
security guard, was beaten almost to
death by New York City police a few
weeks ago while he was being held in the
police station; his assailants raped him
anally with the handle of a toilet plunger.
This summer, an unarmed woman was

dragged out of her car (not only was she j

not displaying violent behavior, she was
still in her safety belt), then physically
assaulted and verbally threatened by a
highway patrolman. The attack occurred
in broad daylight on a heavily traveled
highway —- and was caught on the squad
car’s own video camera.

Police brutality exists. That’s why
we have laws to counter police brutality.
The above cases have had repercussions
for the police involved (although not suf-
ﬁciently swift and severe‘ 5' tis

  

from criminals display
themselves, that’s wron

actions. .
Before I go an
take this opportunity
important disclaimers. First, I am not
accusing all police ofﬁcers of abusing
their powers. In fact, I believe that most
of them are genuinely good people who
do an extremely difﬁcult and dangerous
job the best they can. Second, I recognize
that police have special rights (detaining
suspects, handcufﬁng, frisking, and rea-
sonable force) that allow them to do their
job and defend themselves. But I also
think that there are individual policemen
who are not worthy of the badge they
wear or the powers that come with it.
What I don’t understand is why ofﬁ-
cers (at least in the organized form of the
Fraternal Order of Police) don’t have a
burning desire to kick out the few who
give them all a bad name. The recent
debate over whether or not to establish a

  

Civilian Review Board in Pittsburgh was
memorable for the vocal opposition of
the FOP. The basic idea of a CRB is that
private citizens should have some formal
channel through which to register com-
plaints, other than an internal review by
the police department. From the spin the
FOP put on it, you would have thought
that the measure was asking the
Pittsburgh police to keep their bullets,
Barney Fife-like, in their front pockets
instead of in their guns.

One of the more offensive artifacts
of the nasty PR barrage launched by
CRB opponents was a mailing done by
the local FOP this spring, right before the
referendum. It’s a large postcard (5 1/2”
by 9 1/ ”), made of white cardstock
printed with blue ink. It was computer-
addressed to “Pittsburgh Neighbors”
(which ﬁlled me with an instant sense of
warmth and fellow feeling, I assure you).

TECTING YOU!” _
My reaction went something like
this:
- If you actually are protecting peo-
. , p .. ..- - _ 2.-‘_.‘,. ,1 r 

   

 
  

been “Don’t put shackles on  . ’

I, and a majority of my fellow
Pittsburghers, voted “yes,” and I would-
n’t rule out the possibility that this was

partially because this absolutely
barefaced propaganda strategy back-
ﬁred.

All that measures like the CRB are
for is to try to weed out the people who
exhibit the behavior they’re supposed to
be controlling. Those who are supposed
to be protected and served have to have
the power to deﬁne the parameters of
police powers.

Heather Barnett thinks requests such as
“Please do not pull over random people
and commence beating them” are rea-
sonable.

 

    
    
 
 
  
 

Police must be free to use
strong measures to protect us

Michael Berquist
Columnlst

In recent months, the issue of crimes
committed by members of our police
departments has been thrust directly into
the forefront of the public conscious-
ness. The sad case of the New York City
police officer who brutally assaulted a

Jamaican immigrant and the Jonnyv

Garnrnage case are but two of the most
well-known examples of police brutali-
ty. While some feel that police brutality
is a major problem, I disagree. This is
why:

To be sure, police brutality does
exist and is a problem. However, the
question that ought to be asked is just
how big a problem is it, and do the ben-
eﬁts of handicapping our police forces,
as many suggest to combat this problem,
outweigh the potential risks.

To use the two examples I noted
_to restr '

  
   
  
 
  
 
 
     

      

gripped the city. In 1990, there were an
astounding 2,245 murders in New York,
prompting headlines in some newspa-
pers that read: “DO SOMETHING
DAVE!”

step outside of their homes for fear of
the gangs and criminals that prowled the
streets like predators.

His successor, Rudolph Guiliani,
refused to make that mistake and rode
the wave of anger about the city’s hor-
riﬁc crime rate to a victory in the 1993
election. As mayor, Guiliani increased
the city’s police force from 26,000 to
38,000. He also put creative and innova-
tive people in charge of his police
department, and ordered his police com-
manders to execute more aggressive
sweeps of areas of high crime. “An
arrest is almost a failure,” noted the
mayor. ‘The better way to manage a
police department is to prevent crime in
the first place and ﬁnd ways of measur-
ing that.”

'petriﬁed'"to"

How successful has ' Mayor
Guiliani’s program been? The city has
seen its crime rate fall by 50 percent and
its murder rate drop by 63 percent. The
city, once derided as a crime-ridden
cesspool, is now relatively safe. The

beneﬁts of having a police force operat— _

ing without restraints are obvious.
Unfortunately, due to many of the
handicaps we have already placed on
our law enforcement departments in
recent years, the majority of the public
feels that it’s rapidly losing ground in the
war against crime. An April 1995 poll
asked the American public whether we
were winning the war on crime or losing
ground. An astonishing 77 percent of the

‘public felt we were losing ground,

against just 9 percent who felt we were
making progress. Thanks to the Clinton
Administration’s innovative crime-
ﬁghting strategies, instances of violent

. crime have been on the decline in recent

years, but the fear of crime has not less-
ened.

Robert F. Kennedy once remarked:
“The real threat of crime is what it does
to ourselves and our communities. No
nation hiding behind locked doors is
free, for it is imprisoned by its own fear.
No nation whose citizens fear to walk
their own streets is healthy, for in isola-
tion lies the poisoning of public partici-
pation. A nation which surrenders to
crime —— whether by indifference or by
heavy-handed repression — is a society
which has resigned itself to failure. Yet,

 ' ‘i ﬂjy Americans seem to
' pervasive enemy that
‘ ted ...” His words, spo-
are certainly applicable
_ when crime and the fear
"_ e such pervasive problems.
{of handicapping our police
1 d leaving control of our
streets to" the thugs and criminals who
prey upon those who carmot protect
themselves, we ought to take steps to
force out corruption within our police
forces and punish police officers who
use their positions to betray the trust the
public has placed in their hands. Clearly,
as I pointed out in the case of New York
City, the beneﬁts of aggressive law
enforcement speak for themselves. In
places without the presence of the police
keeping order, there is anarchy. In places
where the police are allowed to aggres-
sively ﬁght crime, the public need not
fear being victimized.

Michael Berquist thinks that while
police brutalityis a problem, we ought
not retreat from protecting our streets
from criminals.

 

Kicking game
could ruin Pitt’s
bowl chances

Entering last Saturday’s game
against the Rutgers Scarlet Knights,
the Pitt Panthers realized that a
strong showing against Rutgers, cou-
pled with wins in two of their last
four games, could propel them into
their first bowl game since 1989.

With bowl hopes riding in the
balance, the Pitt squeaked out a 55-
48 victory against the 0-8 Scarlet
Knights. In the process, however, the
Panthers almost shot themselves in
the foot.

Of the three components that
make up a football team —offense,
defense and special teams — only
one played well on Saturday. The
offense had an outstanding day, rack-
ing up an amazing 645 yards and 31
first downs.

The defense, well, hung in there,
to put it nicely.

But the scourge of the Panthers
on Saturday was the special teams.
They were absolutely pitiful, to put it
nicely.

Specifically, it was Pitt’s kicking
game that almost prevented the
Panthers from leaving Piscataway
victorious.

Junior placekicker Chris
Ferencik suffered through a horrific
day, botching four point-after—touch-
down tries and one field goal. He
alone accounted for seven missed
points and single-handedly almost
cost the Panthers the game.

Ferencik was able, to his credit,
to set one dubious mark: the missed-
kick grand slam. On his four missed
PATs, Ferencik had one kick
blocked, one kick miss wide right,
one kick hit the crossbar and one
kick that wasn’t even attempted due
to a high snap.

To add to his stellar day,
Ferencik even had a 30-yard field-
goal attempt blocked in the first
quarter.

But Ferencik was not the only
Panther to commit kicking blunders
against Rutgers. Grant Coffield,
obviously taking cues from his
place-kicker, boomed four mighty
punts that averaged a whopping 35
yards per kick.

Despite Coffield’s feeble efforts,
Ferencik was not to be outdone in
this game.

Pitt men ready for
Big East title defense

Matt Townsend
Staff Writer

Pitt men’s swimming Head Coach Chuck Knoles is a
jack-of-all trades kind of guy. He is a coach, a motivator and,
periodically, a locksmith.

Yes, a locksmith. During an interview with Knoles, the
door to the swim team’s office in Fitzgerald Field House
magically became impenetrable and the occupants were
locked up in the cozy ofﬁce for a half an hour or more.

Knoles was restless. He desperately needed to get to
Trees pool to start swim practice. The Pitt swim coach
whipped out his tool set and went to work. After some ham-
mered ﬁngers, a few expletives and not much help from the
maintenance men, the door was jarred open.

By freeing the enclosed prisoners, Knoles displayed the
work ethic and smarts that have consistently made the men’s
swim team the squad to beat in the Big East and the class of
Pitt’s athletic teams. In Knoles’ seven years of coaching, the
team has won four Big East titles.

“The guys enjoy saying that we are one of the best teams
on campus,” said Knoles.

In all, the men’s team has won 12 of 15 Big East titles,

_ dating back to the ﬁrst Big East conference meet in 1983.

After a two—year hiatus from their perennial “King of the
Mountain” status, the Panthers rebounded last year by upset-
ting top—seeded Syracuse in the conference meet at Rutgers.

This year’s team goals are higher than just another Big
East championship. Knoles and his swimmers are focused
on a rim for the Top 20 in NCAA Division-I swimming and

Freshman Nicole Bashor

minds net for Pitt soccer

It happens all the time. Athletes
who were the stars of their high-
school teams come to college only
to face the brutal reality that it’s a
whole diﬂ’erent ball game at the
major-college level.

The skill level and intensity of
Division-I athletics eats most fresh-
men alive.

But Nicole Bashor is of a rare
breed. Last year she was making
diving saves for the Central
Dauphin East High School soccer
team in Harrisburg. This year she is
the starting goalkeeper for the
Pittsburgh Panthers.

But here’s the remarkable

thing: Not only is she starting, but
the humble ﬁeshman has emerged
as one of the Panthers’ best players.
The transition that shatters the con-
ﬁdence of so many hasn’t even
fazed Bashor.

“I think the biggest dilference
[between high-school and college
soccer] is the physical aspect,” she
said. “College teams are just so
much stronger.”

Bashor, who started every
game in her four years of high
school, realized that coming to Pitt
would mean seeing sonre irnmedi-
ate playing time, for its soccer pro-
gram is only two years old.

Irnmediate is right. She started
in Pitt’s season opener at Duquesne.

While the Lady Panther offense has been weak, Bashor
has held Pitt opponents to just over two goals a game.

No one could stop the bleeding. Not
Patrick Kenny. Not Dave Ciarletta. And
certainly not little Ian Lebwohl, who lay
sprawled in front of the hockey net after
Indiana University of Pennsylvania scored
its 15th goal to conclude 60 minutes of
offensive torture.

I Fifteen goals. Yes, 15 goals.

“We didn’t do anything right,” said
senior defenseman Tony Hermankevich.
“When things went right for us, we still did-
n’t do anything right.” '

The Panthers faced 011“ against IUP,
who defeated them 6-0 in their last meeting
on Oct. 11. The Panthers recovered from
their bumps and bruises suffered in that loss
to take on the Indians in their sexond of
three meetings this season.

“To tell the midi, we hoped to be a bit
more physical on our side, but the game
itself wasn’t that physical,” said
Hermankevich. “It wasn’t as physical as I
expected, even against IUP, butl admit I did
get my bell rung pretty good a couple of
times.” ‘

Pitt came out hitting, but IUP’s oﬂ°en-
sive skills outvvitted the attempts at physical
play. The Indians opened up scoring early,
notching their ﬁrst goal two minutes into
the game —— a long slap shot that sailed by
Kenny. IUP followed the goal with several
prime scoring attempts, peppering Kenny
with shots from directly in front of the net.

The Indians tallied four minutes later

IUP pummels Panther hockey club, I5-l

when Tim Laughlin slid the puck between
Kenny’s legs for his ﬁrst of three goals on
the night. IUP then extended its lead to three
on a breakaway goal by Marc Emling.

Pitt’s only strong scoring opportunity
came at the 15-minute mark of the ﬁrst peri-
od, when Andy Mecs’ one-on-one break-
away attempt was stopped by the Indian
goalie. V

But Kenny and his magical glove
weren’t enough to stop IUP’s olfense. The
Indians came ﬂying out in the second peri-
od, scoring three power-play goals in less
than four minutes to make the score 60.
That was it for Kenny, as he was yanked in
favor of sophomore Ciarletta.

Ciarletta eased the Panthers’ defensive
woes a bit, surrendering only two goals late
in the second period. But when it looked
like Pitt had begun to exhibit conﬁdence in
front of its goalie, Head Coach Jim Brown
put sophomore Lebwohl in goal.

Lebwohl dove, ﬂopped and fell all
over IUP’s shots through the ﬁrst 10 min-
utes of the third period, stopping three shots
at point—b1ank range from the slot. The
Panthers rose to Lebwohl’s defensive per-
formance after center Mike Girvin was
thrown out of the game for ﬁghting. His
ejection gave the Indians a ﬁve-minute
power play. Despite taking 10 shots on
goal, the Indians couldn’t convert on their
one-man advantage.

Pitt avoided a whitewash when
Hermankevich sent a blast from the right
point past the IUP goalie to make the score

8-1. -

“Our lack of oﬂ°ense stemmed from
not being able to break out of the zone,” the
defenseman explained. “We spent most of
our time in the defensive end, and you can’t
play oifense from the defensive end. When
we did get shots, we missed the net, and we
didn’t make things happen.”

After Herrnankevich’s tally, the
Indians went on an olfensive tear and put
seven goals past Lebwohl to wrap up their
third win of the season.

The loss to IUP drops the Panthers’
record to 1-2. Jake Polochak had the lone
assist for the Panthers, who mustered only
20 shots on goal, compared to the Indians’
65.

Despite the mediocre play of the goal-
tending trio, the No. 1 position was not at
stake in Sunday night’s game.

“All three of us played well consider-
ing the situation we were in,” Ciarletta said.
“The coach wanted to see each of us play,
so there was no chance for one of us to get
killed in g .”

The Panthers travel to Happy Valley
this Saturday to play Penn State’s “B” team.
Hermankevich expects the team to regroup.

“If we play as undisciplined as we did
on Sunday, Penn State will destroy us,” he
said. “We have to combat that team by
playing well, playing disciplined, and stay-
ing in our places on the ice. We have a lot
of young players who know how to play.

What is so frustrating about
Pitt’s kicking performance is that the
Panther offense had its best output of
the season.

Pete Gonzalez did his job. He
passed for 470 yards and seven
touchdowns — both school records.

Jake Hoffart and Terry Murphy '

did their jobs. The duo combined for
17 catches and 289 yards receiving.

Dwayne Schulters did his job,
providing 150 yards on 25 carries.

Even the Pitt defense had its
highlights, namely Rod Humphrey,
who recorded eight tackles and one
sack in his first game back after knee
surgery. -

But Ferencik and Coffield most
definitely did not do their jobs.

With the pitiful kicking game
that it showcased on Saturday, Pitt
cannot expect to win any one of its
four remaining games.

What needs to be noted is that a
team’skicking game is just like a
line judge’s job: Nobody notices you
until you screw up. ,

But the Panthers’ kicking woes
need to be rectified. If not, they can
“kick” their ‘bowl hopes away.

rience of returning team members.
Freshmen Katie Hunter and Amanda
Lyle will help the team’s depth a great deal

I in their sprinting events, which were the

weakest part of last year’s swimming team,
according to Cassidy-Keen.

Keenandtheveteransonthesquadare
pleased with the progress the ﬁeshmen have
made so far this year.

“The freshmen are doing very well so
far,” junior leader Chabotar said

The swimming team ofﬁcially began its
season last weekend at the Pepsi Collegiate
Aquatic Sports Championship in Ft.
Lauderdale, Fla.

As a team, the Panthers showed their
strength by putting together a great team
perfonnance.

The Pittsburgh entry ﬁnished second in
the open-water three-kilometer team race,

edged out by Texas Christian University by ,

just 21 seconds. In the synchronized diving
competition, freshman Erika Nirn and
sophomore Jamie Tomazich ﬁnished sec-

Wednesday, 29 Octoer 1997

ond in the one-meter competition and third
in the three-meter event. While none of
these events is part of the standard NCAA
dual—meet format, the performance bodes
well for these two divers, Cassidy—Keen
said

Dual meets were a problem for the
Lady Panthers, as they ﬁnished 7-6in these
contests last season.

Last year, the team had only three
divers, which hurt them a little. “We only
had one really really good diver, and the
numbers just were not there to win points for
the squad overall,” Chabotar said.

Thisyear,theLadyPanthersaddthroe
freshmen to this group that will bolster the
team’s numbers and help add depth to all of
those retuming from last year. A sixth diver
mayalsoreturnﬁominjurytomakethisa
very deep Panthers squad

This weekend should be a stepping
stone for this Lady Panther team to improve
upon last year. The freshmen and the veter-
ans seem to be gelling just in time for meets
against St. Bonaventureand Syracuse this
weekend.

diving. .

‘The proof in the pudding will be how
many guys we can get to the NCAA cham-
pionships,” said Knoles. “If we can get six
or seven guys there, that will be a huge step
towards the Top 20.”

Pitt ' has consistently sent a couple of
athletes to the NCAAS each year, but with

FROM PAGE 8

the new athletics-department regime, the‘

team will ﬁnally receive the ﬁnancial sup-
port it has been wanting for years.

The budget hike has permitted the sin-
gle most important addition to the men’s
team —— the hiring of Pitt’s ﬁrst full-tirne
assistant men’s swimming coach, Ryan
“Reggie” Bair.

“When I ﬁrst met Steve [Pederson], he
asked what I needed,” said Knoles. “I said
I need a full-time assistant, and he told me

to hire one. So, I did, and it was that easy.
It is remarkable what a new guy can do.”

Bair, a 1996 Pitt graduate, was a walk-
on under Knoles from 1992 to 1996. He
doubles as the lead singer for the local
band Big Bean Theory.

“Reggie has a keen eye and a quick
mind,” said Knoles. “He will undoubtedly
become an invaluable keystone to our pro-
gram within a very short time.”

The team lost just two seniors, back-
stroker Mike Speerschneider and last
year’s top diver, John Soulakis. Other than
those losses, the same team that won the
Big East last year is still intact. Knoles
hopes the squad is putting pressure on
itself to repeat and improve on last year’s
season.

Pitt will open its dual—meet season this
weekend at Trees pool with St.
Bonaventure on Oct. 31 and Syracuse the
next morning. ‘

SOCCER

The Panthers lost the contest, but Bashor
made several dramatic saves and allowed
just one goal in the 1-0 defeat.

“I was nervous, but once the game got
going I didn’t even notice,” she said of her
ﬁrst collegiate game. “Usually afterl make a
save or at least touch the ball, I’m a lot more
relaxed.”

Startingasaﬁeshmanandstartingasa
freshman in goal are two totally diiferent
things. An inexperienced ﬁeld player has ﬂie
rest of her teammates to help her cover for
those rookie mistakes.

Should a shot go in, all eyes turn to the
goalie, not the ﬁeld player who missed an
assignment that permitted the shot on goal.

Most ﬁeshmen would crumble under
that kind of pressure, but Bashor has
excelled in the net this season.

“Goalkeeper is the No. 1 position you
need  to be competitive,” Head Coach
Roland Sturk said. “If you’re not solid in

FROM PAGE 8

goal, you’re in trouble.”

Bashor has just two wins compared to
seven losses and two ties this season, but her
record is not due to poor play on her part.
She has only given up an average of about
twogoalspergameandhasmade84saves.

The problem is that Pitt hasn’t been able
togettheballinthe net—apretty important
aspect of the sport. The Panthers have scored
just six goals in 16 games.

“Psychologically, it’s tough [on
Bashor],” Sturk explained. “We haven’t
been scoring, so it puts Nikki in a position
where she feels like if she gives up one goal,
she’s going to lose.”

“I think the key thing she provides for
the team is that the players have conﬁdence
in her. They know that if Nikki is on, we
have a chance to win.”

The conﬁdence the rest of the Panther
squad has in its keeper translates into better
play by the entire team.

“We play hard for her,” midﬁelder
Charity Kriley said. “We don’t want to let
her down because she doesn’t let us down.”
