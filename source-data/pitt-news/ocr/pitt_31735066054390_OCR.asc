A group of professors hope to
make Oreo cookies and'Ritz crackers
scarce on campus by asking the
University to boycott Nabisco prod-
ucts in response to the company’s
plan to close the Pittsburgh plant.

Mark Ginsburg, a professor in the
international studies and education
department and president of the

- United Faculty of the University of -

Pittsburgh, is leading an entourage of
faculty who plan to bring this issue'to
a vote at the Faculty Assembly meet-
‘ing on Sept. 8. z

The Nabisco plant, located on
Penn Avenue in East Liberty, is
scheduled to close on Nov. 20,
despite the fact that 348 union work-

nation, according to Ginsburg.

“It may seem unimportant, but
people tell me they remember playing
baseball as a kid and smelling_the
pastries being made,” Ginsburg said.
“[The plant] has been afixture in the
community for 83 years.”

Nabisco products include Oreo
cookies, Ritz crackers, Nilla Wafers,
Fig Newtons, Al Steak Sauce and
Milkbone dog biscuits.

Ginsburg said the goal is to get
Pitt and all the food service compa-
nies that have subcontracts with the

University to stop serving or selling

Nabisco products. .
Although the Faculty Assembly is
only an -advisory board, Ginsburg
expects to receive the University’s

The University of Pittsburgh’s
Center for West European Studies
has been selected to be the home of
one of only 10 European Union
Centers in the United States.

The program to create European
Union Centers was designed by the
Delegation of the European
Commission in Washington, D.C.,
to promote study of the European
Union and to boost relations

throughout -this country.

“This (program) ensures that the
University of Pittsburgh will remain
at the forefront of research and
teaching on this historic integration
of Europe,” said Albert Sbragia,
director of the CWES at Pitt.

This is an extremely competi-
tive program and a great honor for
Pitt, said Michael Malloy, associate
director of the CWES.

Other recipients of this honor
include Harvard University, Duke
University, the University of North

Madison.

According to Malloy, there are
three principal goals of the E.U.
program: ’

- To promote research, teaching
and academic activities focusing on
the European Union. -

- To further develop a regional.

outreach network in the tri-state
area, to increase knowledge of the

‘European Union, and to foster dis-

cussion on it.
- To integrate both academic
and outreach networks into a trans-

activities planned to work toward 
these goals. These plans include A
three new courses on regulatory,i

economic and political issues in the

European’ Union; planning of dis-A

Nebraska police to bust more underage drinkers

John Funk

Dally Nebraskan

LINCOLN, Neb. (U—WIRE) —
Underage students planning on
attending or holding beer parties
should be prepared to face the con-
sequences, Lincoln police_said.

As part of a special enforcement
project, Lincoln police are focusing
more of their resources on the
increasing number of parties being
thrown each year.

The problems associated with
large house parties, such as physical
and sexual assaults and neighbor-
hood disturbances, have grown
along with the parties, which are
attended regularly by .more than 100
people, Lincoln Police Chief Tom
Casady said Monday.

The enforcement effort was
planned with
University of Nebraska-Lincoln to
maximize its effects, said James
Griesen, vice chancellor for student
affairs. ~ V .
“This was a conscious and coor-
dinated effort with Lincoln police,”
Griesen said.

Casady said partygoers have
become more fearless and confronta-
tional.

-“Ten to 15 years ago, everyone
would run and slink away if the
police showed up at a party,” Casady
said. “Now people refuse to leave,
and conflict results.”

To combat the problem, the
Lincoln Police Department assem-

bled a squad of seven officers last‘

weekend to‘ respond to large parties.

From Aug. 29pto 31, the special
detail handled eight parties, where
they issued 56 citations to those con-
suming, buying and distributing
alcohol.

Some officers worked undercov-
er to infiltrate parties where alcohol
was sold, and uniformed officers
broke up the parties. ‘

Officers also seized evidence
from the parties, including beer
kegs, money from illegal sales and
signs advertising prices.

This week police arefollowing
up on last weekend’s parties by iden-

tifying people who bought the a1co- ’

hol and -calling landlords who own
the party houses. _

Police also are notifying parents
of partygoers and the university
when students are involved.

Under the student code of con-
duct, Griesen said, students could
face penalties ranging from a warn-
ing to a dismissal from the-universi-
ty, in addition to criminal charges.

Though the university does not
usually exercise its jurisdiction for

graduates. Pitt has more graduate stu-
dents at 9,000, while Moscow has 7,000.
A notable difference between the

' two schools is the capacity of their stadi-

ums. While Pitt Stadium can seat more
than 55,000 - people, Moscow’s Lenin
Stadium has a seating capacity of more
than 100,000 people. This is partly
because of the 1980 Olympics, which
were held in and around the University
of Moscow.

The University of Moscow is locat-
ed just outside of Moscow and is within
walking distance from the Kremlin. The
university was founded in 1755 by a
Russian scientist named Mikhail
Lomonosov and was the ﬁrst university
in Russia. ’

Of the hundreds of thousands of
Moscow graduates, among whom are

Nobel Prize winners in the sciences, the

most notorious alumni of the university
are Mikhail Gorbachev and his wife,
Raisa. Mikhail Gorbachev graduated
from the university with a degree in law,
while his wife graduated with a degree in
Leninist philosophy.

The two tallest university buildings
are stlikingly similar down to the last
few feet. And those few feet make all the
difference.

Engineers estimate that the
Cathedral of Learning will resist natural
disintegration for at least 500 years, so
the battle will more than likely continue.

A boycoﬂnot worth
  dunking in milk

The Nabisco plant in East
Ipiberty will shut down Nov. 20,

   
  
  

' ith corporate downsizing still in
 worldwide, it was
' . evitable that Nabisco would
entually adopt a “let them eat
 'tz Bitz” attitude. ’ 4
’ Several Pitt professors are
rshing for a boycott of Nabisco
'oducts in Pittsburgh unless the
company decides to keep the
plant open. While this is an
admirable call — as is any call to
action in aiding working people
who face the loss of their jobs ——
it is a rather _moot point. The
Nabisco corporation has decided
the short-terrn fate of 348 people
—— the ﬁght is over.
The Pittsburgh - plant, while
considered. efficient by Nabisco
management, is too small." The
company’s reasoning is this:
What can be made in Pittsburgh
can be made easier elsewhere.
When the bottom line and proﬁts
rank high on Nabisco’s priority
list, 348 Pittsburgh workers ‘losing
their jobs won’t cause Nabisco’s
ecutives to lose any sleep.
Surveys conducted by local
ewspapers have shown that a
ittsburgh consumer won’t for-
s ake his or her sweet tooth to take

' up the cause of the disenfran-

chised. Oreo or “social justice”?

_ following

The American public can’t have
“social justice” with milk.

, Seagate and Alcoa are just
two of the big companies bringing
jobs to the Pittsburgh area.
Though they are not in the same
industry as Nabisco, they’re
bringing over 3,000 jobs. Rather
than fretting over 348 lost jobs,
the residents of Pittsburgh should
cheer the arrival of 10 times more.

‘They should reroute their focus

from an inevitably ill-fated boy:

cott to recruitment of new compa-
nies looking to make Pittsburgh

their home.

The city of “Pittsburgh should
create an atmosphere conducive
to business. Concentrated efforts
should be made to get businesses
to invest in Pittsburgh. Fickle cor-
porations in this global economy
can always take their jobs over-
seas. Pittsburgh should attract
business, make it attractive for
them to stay here, yet also ensure
that they don’t’stiff the working
people.

Nabisco should not be blamed
for its downsizing; it‘ is merely
the trend.
Concentrating on the stock mar-
ket, the bottom line and proﬁts
inevitably leads to_ even more
unequal distribution of wealth and
the event that the working man is
pushed aside.

A meal plan not worth digesting

As you probably know by now, the Food
Services Department (whom I lovingly refer to
as “Big Brother”) has decided that by Sunday
night, any unused meal" blocks for the week
should  forfeited

Iwouldliketotakethisopportunitytothank
the thinking, caring Food'Services for another
great idea I have thoroughly enjoyed the depart-
ment’s ﬁne food products and organizational
skills for the past two semesters. ,

WhereelsecanIgobuttotheCathedral
Cafe’s Starbucks to enjoy biscotti? No, my new
ﬁeshman friends, college life is not about beer,
it’s about deliciously dry pastry! _ _

Sometimes when I can’t sleep at night, I like
to think back to the time last year at Starbucks
when the cashiers tried to helpme use the last-
$25,of my meal plan. Oh, the laughs we had
when they discovered their error“. using my
CampusFunds rather than my Dining Dollars!
AsIrecalltheir“We don’tkr1ow howtoﬁxthat,”
I close my eyes and dream, a contented smile on
my lips. Oh, the joy of thievery!

The Cathedral Cafe’s Chick-ﬁl-
A offers oh-so-moist chicken. It’s so
wonderful that I save my Dining
Dollars just to spend special occa-
sions there. Oh, they don’t take meal blocks. Or

, your immortal soul. Believe me, I’ve offered

both in an attempt to get my hands on one of
those greasy cardboard boxes!

The food at Eddie’s is something special.
Where else ‘do 15 ounces of cereal cost $7.50?
Surely not at the local grocery store! Those are
goumtet Lucky Charms!

Got milk for that magical deliciousness?
The refrigerated shelves irregularly display
gourmet milk for purchase. I’d never bought
such expensive milk before I came to Pitt!
College certainly exposes you to new experi-
ences! ,

I love ﬁnding out how much I’m paying at
the cash register. Where else can you buy food
without actually lmowing the price ahead of
time? - V

advertised) and cheese pizzas are available for

rapidly changing Pizza Hut block specials and
‘the confusion this frequently causes me.

' Of course, those crazy lmuckleheads at
Schenley like to play their zany practical jokes!
Many students, seeking nourishmentat night or
around holidays, foolishly believe the many

,_ notices printed with the hours of operation. But

ﬂiese hours are apparently ignored, leaving the
students to stare at a closed steel gate! What
hijinks! What afrm way to run abusiness!

On Sunday nights, students with the blocks-
per-week meal plans gather in Schenley to make
the most of their money. During these high-ener-
gy meetings, those attending playfully grab
every bit of food in sight. This game becomes
more action—packed . when
Hometown Heroes closes early and
only one cashier is at his station!

Thanks to Food Services,
. more students can enjoy this event
because all ﬁve meal plans now have a set nurn—
ber of blocks per week I can’t wait to see the
smiles on the faces of the many students trying to

. alleviate the guilt forced upon them by cash-con-

scious parents! I imagine the smiles of the

Sodexho workers making sandwiches, slopping

trays andringinguporderswillbeequal
Apparently, this new plan came not only as

an attempt to make students happy, but as an

attempt to cut down on the massive food pillage
of Eddie’s and Schenley at the end of each
semester. During those times, students go crazier
than parents buying Cabbage Patch Kids. (I’ve
been saving that analogy for 15 years!) '

. Instead, students will enjoy the B“mini-pil-
lages” each weekend as people blindly ﬁll their
trays with crates of potato chips and newspapers.
Some will ﬁnd they have bought Edensoy brand
soy milk, whether they are wearing tie-dye or
not!

It wanns my heart to know that a faceless

  When there's a choice, there's a way

John

Van Nijmwegen

Abortion is a touchy subject; the
opinions editor warned me not to go
there unless my column transcended the
usual pro-life vs. pro-choice rhetoric.

As an economics student with a pas-

sion for ﬁlm (for some reason, my film’

adaptation of Adam Smith’s “Wealth of
Nations” has not been bought by a
Hollywood studio), «I endeavored to
write a script based on a conservative’s
perception of women who have abor-
tions and the doctors who choose to per-
form them.

I call it “The Serial Abortionist/.”'
‘ Many bom-again Christians have felt

the need to tell me that they came from
“a lifestyle of drugs, welfare cheating,
kleptomania and abortions.” Tele-evan-
gelists and Catholic Unabomber
wannabes endlessly tell us that without
help, some underprivileged women will
continue to have abortions.

The plot of “The Serial Abortionist”
is simple: Lawanda Schlitz, an 18-year-
old black feminist from Knoxville,
Tenn., lives in a trailer park andhas a
typical “Jerry Springer Show” lifestyle
(trailer park, regular affairs, and sex-
triangles with mullet-haired hicks). As a
feminist, she hates everything male. She
loves nothing more than impregnating

herself, and in a ritual three months .

later, she exorcises the demon that was

created with 50 percent male seed.
Her “depositors” are many faceless

men who know not what they’re getting .

themselves into. She meets these
denizens in sleazy bars (where one is
more than likely to bump into one of
those “saintly” tele-evangelists with a
prostitute in his arms), and under the
guise of a "meek, innocent, yet promiscu-
ous girl, she fools and seduces them.
The doctor who performs the oper-
ation, Jerome St. Ides, M.D., is an evil
surgeon with a total disdain of human
life (especially those heinously occupy-
ing the womb). Dr. St. Ides, and his
medical assistant, Lucille Olde English,
have removed over 3,000 victims in

their 10’ years as partners in crime.

hﬂp://www.pitt.edu/~ppc

Since Lawanda is part of the conserva-
tively conceived “lifestyle of abortion,”
she’s clocked in with 29; she’s the “fetal
Jeffrey Dahmer.”

But Lawanda, Dr. St. Ides and Miss
Olde English are about to face their
end; God has sent an emissary to deal
with these - deviants. .Meet Roland i
Goode, a Southern Baptist who, accord- i

ing to the wishes of Ephesians 5:22
(“Wives, submit yourselves unto your
own husbands, as unto the Lordf’)

keeps his wife and six children locked in-
the basement, 

Goode had served on another “anti-L
abortion detail” for the Lord; be tookif
out a doctor at an abortion clinic ini
Baltimore with a homemade mail bomb _.
While making the bomb, he humme
hymns like “All Things Bright an
Beautif .”

After stalking Lawanda, Dr. St. Ide
and Miss Olde English for more tha_
two‘ weeks, Goode finally makes ' A
move. Miss Olde English is beate ,
raped and hacked up in her apartment;
Knoxville police ﬁnd a note attached to
her body stating, “Thou shalt not kill!”

Dr. St. Ides, who lives in the suburbs
in his four bedroom house with a two-
car garage, a white picket fence and a

 
   
     
 

“This house funded by abortions” sign

suspended over the front door, leads a
typical doctor’s life. After abortions in
the morning, he heads off to the golf
course for 18 holes, then has dinner with .
his wife, the Smiths, the Joneses and
whoever else he’s trying to keep up with.
Goode stalks, then strikes. While
Goode is beating Dr. St. Ides on the head
with a 1-wood in the secluded wooded
area‘ surrounding the Fetus Pines Golf
Course, he shouts “Life is precious!;
Thou shalt not kill! Jesus saves! God
bless those who are taken before they
have had a chance to experience life!”
Goode stalks Lawanda, who is
ready to pounce on Earl, an unsuspect-
ing truck driver from Lexington, Ky.
But things won’t go as planned for
Goode. Lawanda has a choice; her des-
tiny is not set in concrete. ,
Before Goode strikes, Lawanda,
using her ghetto survival techniques)
and anti-male ﬁghting tricks that she!
picked upfrom feminists, kills Goode.
The moral of the story: Those who

have a choice have a way. Those who
' cling to old out-dated hypocritical

thoughts are trampled by those who
gain for themselves the power to choose. ’
As for me, I hope I can sell this
script and become the next John Waters
or David Lynch. If not, I can always fall
back on “Wealth of Nations: The
Movie.” 2

0 John Van Nijmwegen ﬁnds it amusing

that pro-lifers almost always support
capital punishment, guns, excessive mil- ‘
itary spending, and cutting down envi-
ronmental legislation. ' I

In search of cinematic originality

Dave Madden
Columnlst
_ Independent cinema is everywhere. It
has a cable channel (two, in fact), it is refer-
enced throughout the media, and ﬁrst—time
“indie” ﬁlmmakers have their own MTV

l Movie Award category. Finally, routes to

movies that divert from the Hollywood form
have been pulled wide open.
The phenomenon has had a huge impact

- on me and my generation of ﬁlmmakers, or
» so I’m assuming. And I’m also going to
i assume that the proliferation of indie ﬁlms in
everyday life is due to two movies and the

household-name directors that made them:
Quentin Tarantino’s “Pulp Fiction” and
Kevin Srr1ith’s “Clerks.”

In many ways, our entire generation, not
just the aspiring ﬁlmmakers, owes a lot of its
identity to these two, sort of like how some
of our parents identify with “American
-Sraﬂiti” or “The Big Chill.” The problem
vith this, though, is our ties to these ﬁlms
teem too strong, and this new generation of
movie-makers, I fear, is being developed
around the ground these ﬁlms have already
broken.

If you ask an aspiring ﬁlmmaker who
his inﬂuences are or who his favorite direc-
tors are chances ~ are you’ll hear either
Tarantino’s or Smith’s name — and often
both — somewhere toward the top of the list.
Because of this, it’s not too hard to see
Tarantino-esque plot lines or Smith-esque

dialogue in most of the work that comes out .

of ﬁlm classes. In fact, it’s often hard to ﬁnd

_, work dilfering greatly from these cinematic
' models.

Therein lies my fear for our generation

of ﬁlmmakers. We’ve seen the models and I’
how they’ve worked (“Pulp Fiction” show-

ing everyone that movies don’t have to be in
strict Hollywood form to get Oscar nods and
“Clerks” showing everyone that movies
don’t have to cost several million dollars to
be successful), and we seem to be following
these models instead of creating our own.
Even more dangerous is that we seem to be
telling other ﬁlmmakers’ stories instead of
our own. In a way, we’re denying ourselves
our own identity.

Our collective goal should be to create a’

new model based on the stories we either
have to tell, want to tell, or in many ways
need to tell ——- not one based on the now-for-

A mulaic movies of Tarantino or Smith "Like

ﬁlmmakers who have conre before us, we
need to process the popular cinernatics and
move on, using them to create a style and
form that we can identify with.

We’re tending to make our own stories
out of previous ﬁlms, often blending several
together to create something “new.” A phe-
nomenon that happens all too often nowa-
days is the description of a new project as
“['Ihis movie everyone’s seen] meets [that
other movie everyone’s seen].” Often there’s
a qualiﬁer of “with a twist of [this movie or
TV show or book or other well-known pop
culture icon].” .

‘ Movies should be artiﬁcial realities that

we create for a deﬁnite purpose, either per-
sonalorsocial.Theﬁlrr1sIseeuscreatingare
deﬁnitely artiﬁcial, but they relate to other
movies, not to anything personal at all. The
result is a constant recycling of material, with
only slight changes that rarely succeed in
hiding the source ﬁom which the material

' came.

Perhaps another reason for this huge
constant referencing to other movies is the
encyclopedic knowledge of ﬁlm a lot of my
peers seem to have developed Ask any sort
of question about any person  with
any random ﬁlm and in any ﬁlm class on
campus, and chances are, there are about four
guys in the class who’ll be eager to give you
an answer. .

‘ Along with the names comes rampant

you

ﬁlm quoting, and this goes far beyond ﬁlm
classes; we all know all the lines of “Pulp
Fiction,” “Clerks,” “The Simpsons” and all
the other ﬁlm/TV giants of our generation.
Thisisallperfectlyﬁneuntilyoustarttosee
screenplays with a line or two from some
other not—too—obscure movie. I once heard
the line, “I’m too old for this shit!” in a scene
written by a classmate. That not only is a hor-
rible line of dialogue, but everyone’s already
heard it, and it’s lost all comedic value.
Plagiarism is not the issue here, so I’m
not even going to bring it up. What’s' most
important is not the apparent lack of original-
ity or talent (tl1ere’s a lot of that here at Pitt,
which is why I’ve stuck around for a third»
year), but rather a lack of inspiration‘ to work
hard at our craft to ﬁgure out new forms and

methods of ﬁlrnmaking. We all seem too
willing to revert back to the cinematic stand-
bys that have proven to work well.

As young ﬁlmmakers on the verge of
this new millennium everyone’s talking
about, we have the potential to change the
irmer—workings of our craft and the expecta-
tions of our audiences just as Tarantino,
Smith, and especially Spielberg, Godard and

, Welles have done before us. We need to

understand our capabilitiesand potentials.
We need to rethink our original goals and
stop walking backward into our futures.

Oakland

stereotypes
students

I feel the Oakland community
has unfairly stereotyped the students
at the University of Pittsburgh.

With the development of the
new Forbes-Craig’ building, many
neighbors have denounced Pitt’s
undergraduates as unruly and wild.

This is just not fair to the stu-
dents. Pitt undergraduates make up a
large partof the Oakland popula-
tion. These students work and
patronize local businesses, keeping
the Oakland economy moving.

Last year alone the undergradu-
ate residents of Pitt raised thousands
of dollars for local charities and
donated hundreds of hours to
Oakland community service pro-

 

jects. e
The new Forbes-Craig building

is not just another residence hall.‘

With the Forbes-Craig building, Pitt
has taken yet another step to make

itself a more competitive _ school."

This new apartment building was
developed ‘carefully to ensure that
its residents would be top-level stu-
dents. The whole idea behind
Forbes-Craig is to build a communi-
ty within a residence hall. Students
were required to apply for a place in
the building and then were carefully

selected by the University adminis-

tration. ,
The University, through its

~I-Ionors College, -has ‘designed a
-building“ that will offer students a -

place to live and learn. This build-
ingwill work in conjunction with

the surrounding museums and other

universities to create and provide
programming that will enrich the

Oakland community and promote

student involvement within it.

e - As a student leader, I can assure
the Oakland’ community that -Pitt
does not tolerate the type of behav-

ior local residents fear. However, I

am proud that the University does
tolerate the development of such

, exciting and innovative projects as

the Forbes/Craig building.

Moak’s crystal
ball for 1998

By now, you new people around
this campus have probably learned
quite a bit of the recent history of Pitt

 sports. You know all about the trip to
if the Liberty Bowl, the new convoca-
1 tion center and so on.

What you didn’t know about

: until now is «Pitt’s future. Here is a-

peek into the crystal ball at some

‘things guaranteed to happen this

year.

1. Matt Lytle will be as good as
Pete Gonzalez was last year. It would
be unfair to expect Lytle to post the
same kind of lofty numbers as
Gonzalez did. Heck, it would be

I

nfair to expect Dan Marino to throw
0 touchdown passes and 241 yards
er game. But keep this in mind: Of
Pitt football’s last 10 victories, Lytle
was the starting quarterback in three,
and he nearly single-handedly won a
fourth (the 1996 Homecoming game
against Temple). That is more impor-
tant than the number of touchdown
passes he makes. ‘

2. Vonteego Cummings will be a
first-round pick in the NBA draft. If
somebody thought Mark Blount was
good enough to draft two years ago,
it’s not a stretch‘ to believe that
Cummings might even be considered
lottery material. Cummings is the

best player most of you will have a.

chance to see at Pitt. Take advantage
of it while he’s still here. '
3. Pitt’s wrestling team will have
more Al1—Americans than last year.
Two of last year’s three All-
Americans, Mark Bodo and John
Withrow, were seniors. The third,
Nick Mengerink, was just a fresh-
man. Three other underclassmen
qualified for the NCAA champi-
onship tournament, at which All-
Americans are crowned. ‘

Plus, the wrestling team has a tradi-_
tion of recruiting outstanding fresh-"

men.
4. The volleyball team will reach

the finals of the Big East tournament.

Normally, this is a safe prediction.

Last year was the first time Pitt

failed to reach the conference ﬁnals

‘ since 1987. All of last year’s. starters

will be returning, and they’ll' be anx-
ious to get back and challenge Notre
Dame. The Fighting Irish have elim-

inated Pitt from the tournament three 9

years in a row. This year should be
Pitt’s best chance to return the favor.

5. Trecia Smith will win multiple
national championships. This is kind

THE Prrr News

For The Pltt News

This Saturday the Panthers
match up against the Villanova
Wildcats to kick off Pitt’s 109th
football season.

Pitt brings a 6-6 record from last
year, while Villanova has a 12-1
record following it, the only loss

coming against Youngstown State in ‘

the playoffs.

The Panthers are returning 13 of
their starters for what looks to be a
more promising season than last
year’s. The quarterback has changed
from Pete Gonzalez to Matt Lytle,
but the same winning attitude
remains.

Pitt’s confidence level should be
greatly elevated after last season’s
important wins against two national-
ly ranked teams. The first such game
was a 21-17 Homecoming victory.
against Miami, then ranked 21st in
the country. After that game, fans
showed their frenzied spirit by rush-
ing to the field and tearing down one
of the goal posts. In the other
notable win, Pitt destroyed 16th-
ranked Virginia Tech in a game that
ended 30-23.

These , victories are something

the Panthers can look back on to get
the confidence they need to win
against Villanova and other strong
opponents.

Villanova’s team is on the young
side, with 13 freshmen and sopho-

mores starting, compared to Pitt’s .

six. One much talked-about Pitt
underclassman is Brandon Williams,
who is starting his freshman year as
a tailback.

Williams was regarded as one of

the top" 20 high school running‘
backs in the country. He rushed for 

4,214 career yards on 414 carries
during his high school career, which
gives Pitt hope that he will work

The Big East will be a stronger
football conference this year, and the
teams should see a dramatic improve-

ment on the conference’s 0-4 bowl-
game record last season. Here is a look’

at the Big East teams, with the record I

,-{predict for each in parentheses.

‘:7 ‘71.'Syracuse (10-1) — The Orangemen
‘will contend with West Virginia for the
, top spot in the Big East. Syracuse will

once again rely on the talents of its

Donovan McNabb, who should put up

candidates and are a nice supporting
cast for McNabb.

Surviving the opening two games
against national powerhouses
Tennessee and Michigan will be diffi-
cult, but they’re excellent tests of this
team’s actual strength. If Syracuse gets
through these two, look out.

2. West Virginia (9-2) — ‘In most cir-

cles, the
Mountaineers are

the Big East. With
possibly the best
all—around team in
the conference,
some even feel an
11-0 season is
reachable. It prob-
ably isn’t, but
WVU’s schedule
is manageable,
with its biggest
challenges coming
in the opener
against Ohio State _V
and the showdown  1 ==«
with Syracuse.

A strong run-
ning attack with
the likes of Amos Zereoue, coupled
with star receivers Shawn Foreman and
a healthy David Saunders, will cause
plenty of trouble for conference defens-

es. Quarterback Marc Bulger will have

plenty of time to ﬁnd these targets with
protection from the best offensive line
in the Big East.

Right about now, Brian
Westbrook is probably the most

You’re probably wondering,
Who’s Brian Westbrook, and why is
he so scared?’

Brian Westbrook is the starting
running back for the Villanova
Wildcats. That means every time he
lines up in the Villanova backfield
on Saturday, he’s going to have the

 

 

menacing eyes of Phil Clarke glar-

Trust me, you’d be scared, too.
Clarke, Pitt’s starting middle
linebacker, will be prowling the
Panther defense with an intensity so
vicious, it could make you vomit.
Sweat will be dripping off his face
while his mammoth, "chiseled arms
bulge from his No. 95 jersey.
Unfortunately for Westbrook,
being a running back means he is

shattering head—on smash. If
Westbrook runs to the outside,
Clarke will chase the running back
down and slam him to the unforgiv-
ing Pitt Stadium turf.

“Phil’s experienced every bump
in the road,” said Pitt head coach
Walt Harris of Clarke’s multiple
injuries.‘ “He deserves a lot of cred-
it. He’s developed into a great
leader for us. We’re looking forward
to him having a great season.”

The leadership role is absolutely
no burden for Clarke. In\fact, ‘he
thrives on it.

“I don’t think I’m stepping up
into [a leadership role],” said
Clarke, a 6-foot, 230-pound senior.
“I have been in it since 1995. I am
the type of person that likes to moti-
vate. What we need is more leader-
ship. Guys coming in can’t just hear
one voice. It gets kind of stale.”

‘Clarke has always had a fiery,

‘ vocal playing style, but last year he

finally got to show just how domi-
nating a force he could be.

Knee injuries cut into his play-
ing time during his freshman and
sophomore seasons, but after Rod
Humphrey got hurt before the start
of last year, Clarke grabbed the

starting joband didn’t let go all sea-

son.
-He led the Panthers with 124
tackles and was second on the team
with five quarterback sacks. But
there’s so much more to the way
Clarke plays than numbers alone
can show.
A For one thing, he’s constantly
swarming to the ball. Even those
times he didn’t make the tackle, he
was right in the middle of the
action. His play is intense, he takes
on blockers full force, and he has
incredible speed for a man his size.
But most importantly, he plays
with heart. He has the ability to fire
up his team with both his vocal
explosions the example he sets 'by
always playing at full speed. If the
game’s on the line, or if Pitt is down

. by. 25, Clarke is playing damned

hard.
His play last year finally gar-
nered him the recognition he

Covington can ﬁnd time to hit these tar-
gets with little protection from a weak
offensive line.

Miami is also weak on the defen-
sive line. If this crew can toughen up,
then the defense will be solid, with a lot
of talent and depth in the secondary.

The team’s schedule is challenging,
with visits from Florida State and
UCLA and trips» to Syracuse and West
Virginia. But the Hurricanes are eager to
avenge their first losing season since
1979.

4. Pittsburgh (6-5) — We must have a
positive outlook on our own season. It
will be interesting to see how the
Panthers, follow last year’s amazing
Liberty Bowl run.

With key players departing on both
sides of the ball, Pitt will have to look

‘elsewhere to ﬁll the holes. That help

should come in the form of Matt Lytle,
the senior quarterback with 11 career
starts, and a slew of junior college trans-
fers and freshmen recruits. Highly tout-
ed freshman Brandon Williams is
Dwayne Schulters and Billy West’s heir
apparent at tailback, and Jackie Womak
will help solidify a thin receiving corps.
Star receiver Terry Murphy and tight
end Juan Williams are sure-handed tar-
gets and will help solidify the offense.
Defensively, Phil Clarke is one of
the best linebackers in the conference,
and D.J. Dinkins and Tray Crayton pro-

vide good size, speed and talent in the
secondary to help strengthen the deplet-
ed roster.

In case you don’t know, Penn State

Big—East last year, and he is a pre-
season first-team All—Big—East
selection of virtually every major
publication, including The Sporting
News, Football Action, Anthlon
Sports and Lindy’s.

But with that recognition comes
expectations, and the Pitt coaching
staff expects a whole lot of Clarke.

He will be the signal-caller for
the defensive unit, which shows
how much the coaches are relying
on his real game experience to help
the team. C

With three key linebackers from
last year’s squad graduated, Clarke
is the only Panther linebacker with
any significant experience.

He will be expected to take his
outstanding play from last year to
an even higher level this season, as
much of the defense is designed
around him in the middle.

‘.‘We are just trying to mix it
up,” Clarke explained. “We are
going to try to be more aggressive.”

More aggressive? That trans-
lates into two things: First Clarke
will take the field more fired—up
than ever on Saturday afternoon,
and second, Brian Westbrook’s

body will be one big bruise by

Saturday night.

Earnest Coakley, all of whom were
important players involved in
defensive coordinator Larry
Coyer’s 4-3 scheme. Helping with
the defense are returning ends
Julian Graham and Marlin Young,

Villanova has a returning line-
up of 17 starters, one of whom is
junior quarterback Chris Boden.
Last season he broke school
records with 42 touchdown passes
and 3,707 passing yards. Another
player to watch is junior tailback
Roger Harriot, a transfer from
Boston University.
