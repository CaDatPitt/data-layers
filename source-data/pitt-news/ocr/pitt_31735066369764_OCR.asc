Posvar Reorganizes University Administration

By JEFF COUCH
Pitt News Staffwriter

Pitt Chancellor Wesley Posvar
announced Friday a major adminis-
trative reorganization, effective
today, to “improve efficiency and
strengthen the external activities of
the university.”

With the reorganization, only
four major offices will report
directly to Posvar rather than eight,
as was the previous administrative
set-up.

Student Aid
at Record
High

By JIM CONNELLY
Pitt News Staff Writer

Financially struggling students
facing another tuition hike this fall
may find relief by taking advantage
of ﬁnancial aid‘ appropriations,
which are at record high levels.
In a recent impact study, the
Pennsylvania Higher Education
Assistance Agency announced that
state-administered student aid for
Pennsylvania at postsecondary
schools had record high approp-
riations of $316,279,520 during the

academic year 1978-79. This is the '

highest figure in the 15 year history
of student aid in Pennsylvania.

Last year’s figures for Pitt's
main campus showed that 5,595
undergraduates and graduate stu-
dents borrowed $11,193,467 under
the Guaranteed Student Loan
Program from participating private
lending institutions.

Student grants totaling
$2,513,442 were given to 4,254
undergraduate students,_ 2,246 of
whom also received $2,194,855 of
federal funds administered through
the Basic Educational Opportunity
Grant Program.

The increases in ﬁnancial aid are
being boosted by federal funds
from the Middle Income Assistance
Bill passed last year in Washington
and the recent passage of the State
Appropriations Bill in Harrisburg.

The PHEAA has already an-
nounced that the maximum income
level needed for state financial aid
consideration has been raised for
the second time this year, from
$21,500 to $25,000. Also, there will
be an increase of 8,374 state grants
over last year’s total available to
undergraduate students through-
out Pennsylvania.

man, former vice chancellor for
planning and budget, to the new
position of senior vice chancellor
for administration.

The vice chancellor for student
affairs, the director of the
Computing Center, the director of
athletics and the vice chancellor for
business and finance will now
report to Freeman, in addition to
the departments under the Office
of Planning and Budget.

The Office of the Provost',”'the
Office of Public Affairs, the Office

of Legal Services, the Office of
Internal Audit and the University
Health Center will continue to
report to Posvar. '

The reorganization does not
represent a demotion for any of the
administrators affected by the
decision, according to Ed Bozik,
assistant chancellor. The reason
for the_ changes is to allow the
chancellor more time to -devote to
external affairs, like fundraising for
the university

“The chancellor has been

handling both internal and external
activities,” Bozik said. “lt’s been
very demanding—he needed time
to devote to the external activi-
ties.”

“One thing we expect (from the
changes) is a little more rapid
action,” Bozik added.

When asked if the reorganization
will hinder Vice-Chancellor for
Student Affairs Conney Kimbo in
his need to express student
concerns directly to the Chancellor

Fall Admissions: More New Students at Pitt Next Year

By GLENN FREUND

Pin News Staff Writer

The rate of enrollment for new
undergraduates in the College of
Arts and Sciences is up about 10
percent for the fall term over the
previous academic year based on
mid-summer figures, according’ to
Director of Admissions Joseph
Marante, who added that applica-
tions are still being reviewed under
the University’s rolling admissions
policy.

The acceptance  of about

250 freshmen and sophomores is an
11 percent increase in the total
number of applicants to the

university. Curently, the accept-
ance rate is about 73 percent, down
from a rate of 77 percent last year.
As of June 22 there were a total of
3215 students accepted for admit-
tance in September out of 4366
applications.

Marante said “In a period of
enrollment decline, Pitt is the only
institution in Western Pennsyl-
vania. with a signiﬁcant. sign of

increase.”

He said that the increase is a
result primarily of “a better
‘recruiting effort and marketing
techniques.” He stressed reputa-
tion of Pitt among major public-

urban institutions is “unmatched
in faculty, academic programs and
resources. ’ ’

The largest "share of the

enrollment increase is a significant.

43 percent in the transfer sector,
compared with a four percen

increase rim‘-freshmen. _.   .

that have transfer potential, mainly
the Community College of Al-

well as a streamlining of services to
transfer applicants, including eval-
uation of credits and ﬁnancial aid
counseling.

Sciences Irwin Schulman said there
are no set standards in considering
applicants, and that the rise in the

Bozik said Kimbo and the other

divisions under Freeman will still,

have access to the Chancellor.

“In so far as that goes, Kimbo’s
access to the chancellor will remain
unchanged, ” Bozik said.

Kimbo told The Pitt News
yesterday the changes will hope-
fully help his office, rather than
hurt it.

‘I must presume we will be able
to work more effectively within the
organizational scheme,” he added.

Candelaria
Okay

' ByTheAssociated Press

Meadville, Pa.—Pittsburgh Pir-
ate pitcher John Candelaria was
treated at a hospital Tuesday after
a two-car crash and released with
what a doctor said was a back
sprain.

Injuries to five persons, includ- .

ing a Rochester, N.Y., family of
three, traveling in the other car
were not serious, medical author-
ities said.

The Pirates said the 25-year-old
lefthander was driving alone when
the collision occurred along Inter-
state 79, five miles south of
Meadville in Crawford County.
Rain had fallen in the area shortly
before the collision, the team said.

Candelaria’s injury did not
appear serious.

“He had soreness in his lower
back, but X-rays were negative.
How long he’s going to be sore is
hard to tell,” said Dr. Williams
Moyers, emergency room chief at
Meadville City Hospital.

Candelaria, who starts for the
Pirates despite chronic _back
problems, said he planned to pitch
as scheduled Saturday.

“I think he can do it,” Moyers
said.

The accident occurred after
Candelaria had left his wife, Liz, at
their farm and started back to
Pittsburgh, Mrs. Candelaria said.

Details of the crash were not
immediately available.

Mr. and Mrs. John Eddington of
Rochester, N.Y., and their 18-year-
old son, Mark, were listed in fair
condition at Spencer Hospital, but
‘a spokeswoman said they probably
would be released.

Two passengers in the Edding-
ton vehicle were released after
examinations at Meadville City
Hospital, a spokeswoman said.

The Pirates said Candelaria
would be examined by a team
doctor on Wednesday.

in selectivity will probably be
reversed in the near future. He
added that the University will have
to be more competitive to maintain
a steady enrollment which he
expects to “drop drastically over
the next ten years” nationwide.

“We can't afford to be as
selective in enrollment,” Schulman
said. He added that because of a
continuing concern for quality, “If
there ‘was sudden drop in appli-
cants we would have to accept a

much smaller class.”  .

Less Access
for Students?

Pitt students should take a closer look at Chan-
cellor Wesley Posvar’s announcement of an “ad-
ministrative reorganization” of the senior _staff.
That reorganization involves grouping four division
heads under Jack Freeman, currently vice chancellor
for planning and budget.

Freeman's new title will be senior vice chancellor
for administration, and the four divisions reporting

to him, including Student Affairs, will no longer
have direct access to the chancellor.

According to a memo from Posvar to university
faculty and staff, the purpose of the reorganization is
to _“improve efficiency and strengthen the external
activities in the university.”

The" reorganization raises certain questions in our
minds. What does all the bureaucratic shuffling and

accompanying rhetoric mean to Pitt students? Also,
why must Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Conney
Kimbo report to a “go between” rather than to the
chancellor himself.

Upon closer examination of the reorganization, we
must make the following observations and commen-
ts.

Pitt students are already suffering because of their
lack of access to Posvar’s office. Posvar has said in
the past that his office is open to students, yet how
often is it that we actually see the chancellor?
Ask any student leader and he or she will say never.

Curently, students must go through the student af-
fairs office to voice their opinions on various issues.
In turn, the vice chancellor relays (or is supposed to
relay) this information to the chancellor.

With the reorganization, Kimbo no longer has
direct access to Posvar’s office, further isolating the
chancellor from students and their problems.

In effect, a student must talk to Kimbo who talks
to Freeman who talks to Posvar, if he/ she is lucky.
Usually, there are assistants, associates and directors
to see before a student may talk dirvctly to a division
head or senior staff administrator. What happen is a
student must talk to eight to ten administrators in or-
der to make his/ her point. -

Further complicating this bureaucratic mess is the
fact that Posvar may never really be aware of a cer-
tain student problem because many times, Assistant
Chancellor Ed Bozik will act in his place.

The implications are clear. By the time a student
problem reaches the chancellor's desk, it will be

toned down, softened, and filtered byline officers

thus making the most emotional student issue seem
insignificant.

The reorganization may reduce certain ad-
ministrative burdens thus making the decision
making process less difficult. I But, the students will
suffer for it in the long run.

The problem of access to the chancellor's office
plus the yearly reduction of the student affairs
budget seems to indicate a low.,priority rating for
students in the eyes of Posvar and his staff. ,,
The administration must take another look at this‘
reorganization and reconsider its decision. If Pitt is
really as responsive to student needs as it is supposed
to be, students must have a more direct access to the
office of the chancellor.

is that of voting for you. Death and
prison you mete out to small
offenders of the law, because you
judge the right or wrong of the
deed; while honor, wealth, and
respect you bestow on greater
offenders, because you judge the
legality of their deeds. To steal a
