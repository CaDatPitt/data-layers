Engineering Student Cabinet Pres-
ident Mary Grace Lackeyvsaid after
the Student Government Board's
(SGB) final denial of funding for
the ball at last night’s meeting.
Lackey also said nonengineering
students will be unable to buy
tickets for the Shamrock Ball.

The SGB turned down a budget-

the cost of the ball.

Bruce Hall Conversion Set

BY STEVE SYBERT

The renovation of Bruce Hall for

fjiiousing and the establishment of

a University office of research were
key topics discussed at the
Graduate and Professional Stu-
dents Association (GPSA) meeting
Wednesday.

Dr. Joseph Shobin, associate
provost for Graduate Study and
Research, said six floors of Bruce
Hall will be converted to housing
by 1977 because more students
need housing and because of the
present unfavorable housing con-
ditions in the Oakland area.

“The renovation of Bruce Hall is
going to be done," Shobin said.
“What priorities assigned by the

,wniversity with respect to who will

-6 housed is geared to future
graduate and undergraduate en-
rollmcnts."

Shobin cited increasing con-
struction costs and indebtedness
involved in the remodeling of Bruce
Hall and possibly new construction
at the Forbes complex site as

possibly ameliorative for the
housing problem.

The’ forming of an office, of
research to pool research resources
and tie research to graduate
students studies also was discussed
by the GPSA. /

“There are 101 people doing
research on campus, but none of
them know what the other is
doing," said Khalid Rauf Mehtab-
din of the Budget Policies
Committee." “They must get
together'on the research being
done. There should be an
administrative staff for this re-
search center.”

Since the University requested’

$68,500,000 from the Pennsylvania
Department of Public Education for

1976-77 and was allocated only '

$61,900,000. funds’ used" in re-
search here may be sharply
curtailed.

According to Shobin, most re-
search activities are funded by
grants from government-supported
agencies, requests to the govern-
ment for suitable proposals and

Relaxed Pot Penalties

Gain Police Support

   
 

BY GARY LAMPENFELD

A bill in the state legislature
relaxing penalties for marijuana
possession has gained support
from various government and law
enforcement officials, including
the head of the Campus Police drug
squad.

Under House Bill 1969, persons
caught with. 30 grams or less of
marijuana, or eight grams or less of
hashish, would be issued only a
citation similar to a traffic ticket‘
and could not be fined more than
$100. '

State law currently allows for a
maximum fine of $500 and a
maximum 30-day jail sentence, in

addition to a criminal record for
» repeat offenders.

There were 21 arrests for

“GPSA representatives said ' an
office of research is need to more
efficiently handle the decreasing
funds channelled to the University
for research projects.

“The laws applying to all money
coming to the University from
external sources say the funds
cannot be intermingled, but must
be administered separately,” Sho-
bin said, “and the overhead
‘becomes University revenue or is
contributed to the general devel-
opment of research at the
University." ' ‘

In other actions, Chairman
Sandra DeBourelando announced
plans for the ‘Phone-a-thon for the
annual Alumni Giving Fund and for
a discussion on “collective bargain-
ing and the student” to be held
Wednesday at~5 p.m. DeBoure-
lando also announced Bill Voharas
will no longer be the GPSA
representative to the Graduate
School of Public and International
Affairs.

Group To FighiTuition Hike

BY CHARLES w. 0GG_

“No cutbacks in financial aid or
educational programs and no
tuition hikes," was the rallying cry
decided upon by students meeting

The engineers’ funding request
had been returnedto the Alloca-
tions Committee twice this year,
and according to the SGB constitu-
tion, the Board was responsible for
a ﬁnal decision‘on the funding
request.

Allocations Committee member
Patty Cooper said Allocations
originally had denied funding for
the Shamrock Ball because commit-
tee guidelines prevent funding of

- formals.

“If you fund one group’s formal,
you have to fund them all,” Cooper
said. .

“The engineers’ originally were
denied funding for the ball, and

Allocations doesn’t feel they should

be allowed to budget modify for

funding that was initially denied,”

Students Half-n-Half
On Ticket Question

Pitt students are divided almost
evenly on the question of whether
to stand in line for free Panther
football tickets or pay $3 for a
season ticket.

The recently approved system
allows for no-cost, ﬁrst-come,
ﬁrst-served distribution of student
tickets during the ﬁve-day period
preceding each game.

lf, however, a student does not
want to wait in line, or wants" to be
guaranteed seating at each home
game, he could pay $3 for a season
ticket.

One hundred students were
questioned on campus about their
p1‘efeLrences.

Most students who prefer free
tickets said either they did not
mind the lines or they could not
afford the $3.

Others said free tickets were
worth waiting for, especially if they
did not attend all the games.

“I can't go to all the home
games," CAS student Mary
Farkish said. “So $3 is high for one
or two games." '

Russell Hill, an engineering
student. said at least “by paying
$3, you're assured a seat.”

Of the students questioned, 47
said they would stand in line for
free tickets, 44 said they would pay
$3 for season tickets, and nine had

-no opinion. ~ 4

primarily to countries that support
our policies.

Asked what the state depart-
ment should concentrate on in the
future, the largest number of
responses called for protecting
U_.S. jobs. Many of the other
responses suggested the United

States concentrate on problems at .

home and stay uninvolved
developing countries.

. Samuel Lewis, assistant secre-
tary of state for ‘International
Organization Affairs, said he
sympathized with Pittsburghers
who asked for ﬁrm anti-commu-
nism. “I think all of us would say
peace is the ultimate and highest

with

ideal, but on the other hand no
American wants to think America is
being weak in standing up to its
challenge,” he said.

Lewis said the state department
had to try to mix ﬁrmness and
toughness with the avoidance of
nuclear conflict.

The responses from the numer;
ous Pittsburgh people phoning the
WQED studios, along with the
responses of audience members
during the live program, will be
summarized into a report for
Kissinger.

The all-day program, including}

several workshops, was sponsored
by the World Affairs Council of
Pittsburgh and was lauded as ﬁrst
in American history.

Suicide A Resolution,
Crisis Speaker Says  

BY MARILYN ZRUST

Crisis situations often are resol-
ved in suicide, Rev. John.,Rickloff,
director of “Contact Pittsburgh,” a
telephone problem-referral agency,
said Tuesday night at Carnegie-
Mellon University.

A person ﬁnds himself in a’ state
of crisis when his normal adaptive-
ness breaks down, Rickloff said in
the fourth of a six-lecture series on
death. .

Because of the intensity of
emotions, a body cannot endure
crisis longer than six weeks, he
said, and suicide becomes the
resolution. .

Rickloff , explained the crisis
theory in three stages.

The ﬁrst stage is impact, in
which emotions are visual and in
the form of external energy.

Second is recoil, - a state of
depression in which energy is
internalized and which always
leads to the third state—resolution.

Among the methods of resolution
are development of new coping

methods, ﬂight into psychosis, and
death by suicide.

“Any decision to choose death is
always a resolution,” said Rickloff,
“but it is never a sane choice.”

Rickloff explained three separ-ai_ _

phenomena involved with suicide.
“The ﬁrst is a crisis situation
where all adaptive behavior has
been used and the only way out is
suicide,” Rickloff.said. Society has
an obligation to help these people
ﬁnd new ways of coping, he added.

“Another situation is the last
angry action to get even with a
speciﬁc individual,” Rickloff ex-
plained. “The individual discovers
the suicidal victim in an ugly
situation that he will carry with him
for the rest of his life.

“There is also the situation

where the person’s perception"6:'\_5

reality is correct,” Rickloff said.”
‘This person has confronted all
stages of death and has accepted
death as a normal part of living.
He has a normal, sane thought
process in willing death.”

marijuana on campus in 1975,

according to Campus Police Lieu-
tenant Conte.

“I’m for it (HB 1699),”-Conte
said. “I don’t see why someone
should get a criminal record for
being caught holding a joint.”

A ﬁrst offender currently can
have his arrest record erased,
according to a representative of the
National Organization for the
Reform of Marijuana Laws‘
(NORML).

/"“_.'Jan Ellis, a State College lawyer

‘specializing in drug cases who is

also legal counsel to Pennsylvania
NORML, said an individual arrest-
ed for_ marijuana possession in

-another state cannot have his

record erased for a subsequent
offense in Pennsylvania.

NORML does not endorse the
use of marijuana, Ellis pointed out,
but tries to have criminal sanctions

removed.

“You could say decriminaliza-
tion is a cease-ﬁre,” Ellis said.
“House Bill 1699 redeﬁnes posses-
sion (of marijuana) as a summary

-‘offense, which precludes a physical

arrest. Thus, there’s no ‘arrest
record.” -

(i::—:'-’}l‘8 six states that have
decriminalized marijuana posses-
sion are California, Colorado, Ohio,
Maine, Alaska and Oregon. ,

“I think_ ‘if enough people write
their state representatives and
urge passage of the bill,” Ellis
said, “Pennsylvania will become
the seventh state to decriminalize
pot.” '

A spokesman for Gov. Milton
Shapp said Shapp “unequivocally
favors the bill” and will sign it if
the legislature passes it. ,

Another ofﬁcial who favors the
bill is the director of the State
Ofﬁce of Drug Law Enforcement,

“In general, classifying pot
possession as a summary offense is
a more realistic approach,” Reiter
said. “Such a classiﬁcation would
take a burden off district attorneys
and common pleas courts in
Pennsylvania.” .

Reiter maintained most small
marijuana arrests are handled by
local law enforcement agencies,
rather than by his office, which
conducts investigations at a state-
wide level. '

“Marijuana arrests on a small
scale are usually secondary,”
Reiter said. “The police are usually
called in for some other offense,
and then ﬁnd marijuana at the
scene,or in the suspects’ posses-
sion.

Allegheny County District Attor-
ney Robert Colville thinks mari-
juana laws should not be lightened.

“I don’t think the laws now are

very severe,” Colville said. “Mak- ‘-

ing possession a summary offense
would not mean it would no longer
be a crime. There’s no reason for
more lenient laws.” ‘

Pittsburgh lawyer Bob McLena-
han said he isnot satisﬁed with the
provisions of the bill. ,

‘‘I don’t think the legislators
went far enough,” McLenahan
said. "Marijuana should be legal-
ized, not merely decriminalized.
Under the state’s present system,
the stiffest penalty for a ﬁrst
offender is 30 days probation
without verdict, but the cost of
embarrassing publicity and $500 to
$1,000 in legal fees is a dispropor-
tionate price to pay.”

The American Civil Liberties
Union (ACLU) considers marijuana
possession a victimless crime and

thinks all such crimes should be_

decriminalized, according to the
executive _
Pittsburgh chapter, Marion Da-
mick.

However, Damick said ‘her
organization had not been working
actively for marijuana decriminal-
ization in Pittsburgh because of

limited time, funds and personnel.

A “At this time, unless we see pot
decriminalization as a major
issue,” Damick said, “we don’t
plan to pursue it.”

SCRANTON ACCEPTS U.N.--
POST, WAITS FOR FORD

PHILADELPHIA (AP)—For-
mer Gov. William W. Scranton of
Pennsylvania said yesterday he
would serve as ambassador to the
United Nations if appointed.

He acknowledged that President
Ford had pressed him to take the
post but said that he was reluctant
to talk about it publicly because an
announcement should come ﬁrst
from the White House.

“It is the perogative of President
Ford,” he said. “It is all up to him
how.”

Scranton, a 59-year-old lawyer
and unsuccessful candidate for the
Republican presidential nomina-
tion in 1964, said he has told the
President many times that he
prefers not to take any formal
government post,

“Butl told him also that he feels
that he wants me and believes that
I am the man for the job, I would do
whatever he wishes,” said Scran-
ton, a former classmate of Ford’s at
Yale University Law School.

making, Pitt professor Charles 0.
Jones said yesterday at a lecture
sponsored by Phi Beta Kappa in
the Learning and Research Devel-
opment Building.

Jones, a Falk professor of
political science, spoke to an
audience of approximately 50
persons, most of them nonstu-
dents. His talk was titled “The
U.S. Congress: A Bicentennial
Audit.”

“It should not surprise us to ﬁnd
weak political parties in .Con-
gress,” hesaid. Jones theorized
that Congress is well-equipped to
service and represent its various
constituencies, but’ is poorly
structured towards making priori-
ties, drawing important conclu-
sions and instituting coordinated
‘action in an effort to solve problems
confronting American society.

Noting that both houses and both
parties are organized to facilitate
reelection, Jones said people can’t
expect much from a Congress if
“anything beyond the next election
is considered long’ run.”

“Congress as an institution is

leaﬂetting, teach-ins -and rallies.
Tactics will be decided at the next
week's meeting, at which it willbe

clear how many organizations will

SGB member Larry Krain said
Student Government supports in
principle the formation of an
organization that would involve all
students in a struggle against
possible tuition hikes. I

Krain said he could not speak for
the SGB concerning this coalition,

and he urged the coalition to avoid .

“ideological trappings" to involve
the largest possible number of
students in a consensus.

attacked constantly,” he said. But
he also said, “The same individu-

als are put back into ofﬁce again

and again-”

Jones contended the nation’s
anti-party bias led to the decline of
strong, centralized party. leader-
ship. This lack of leadership, he
said, leads.to inaccountability in
government and places a premium
on presidential leadership.

This, he said, led to the excesses
of the Nixon administration.

“Nixon didn’t invent abuse of
presidential power,” Jones said,
“but his style sure tickled
Congress into action.” Thus Nixon
was largely responsible for recent
attempts at reform.

Jones favors a return to strong

party leadership because “I simply
can’t think of any other avenue that
could’ capitalize on the special
advantages Congress has.”

fourth in the Phi Beta Kappa
series. The next will be on March

The pin faculty will be voting for or  a union in only 18 days,

unfavorable light and mostly because it compromises the students’
position, which by the nature of the issue is. already at a disadvantage.

There’s no direction SGB President Barry Weisband can take but

’ one of intense examination of the union positions, followed by a ~
presentation to students. Weisband has spoken to only one union

Patriotism in Retrospect

. BY DANAMULHOLLAND

I Throughout history in times of
greatest peril, certain men have
risen above the circumstances and
come to grips with the problems at

hand. Armed with little more than .

stern conviction of their positions
and willsof iron, they have locked
horns with the forces of evil and
battled to the bitter end. But even

four statements from pro- and
anti-union ' groups on the Pitt
faculty unionization election
scheduled for March 9 and 10.

The AAUP has had 60 years of
experience in higher education and
was recognized as an effective
advocate for faculty rights long
before collective bargaining be-
came a legal option. It has 70,000
members, 1,360 chapters, 47 state
conferences and 3.500 Pennsyl-
vania members, mostly ﬁgures of

Horatio at the bridge, Roland at
Roncesvalles and St. Thomas More
are only a few examples of
individuals whose deedsare etched
in the annals of Western
civilization. But to this list should
be added the name of a courageous
20th century American who gave
his all in defense of the country he
loved, only to be struck down in the
end. That man is ‘the late Sen.
Joseph McCarthy‘.
McCarthy was imbued with
-patriotism, a—virtue. sorely lacking
in recent years. His love of America
and its freedoms can be traced to
his origins in the Wisconsin farm
country among sturdy Irish Catho-
lic stock. His rise‘ from these
humble beginnings to the U.S.
Senate could have come" from a
story by Horatio Alger, based as it
was on hard work -and self-reliance.
It was not surprising then that
when this Marine-turned-senator
became awarethat the enemies of
the republic were attacking from
within as well as from without, he
reacted as any true patriot would
by launching a counterattack.
From his famous Wheeling,
W.Va. speech in 1950 until his
premature death in 1957, McCar-
thy fought continuously to expose
and destroy communist subver-

sion in our government. From his

post as chairman of the Senate
Committee on Government Opera-
tions, he succeeded in ferreting out
hundreds of government workers
who were bad security risks,- if not
outright spies. And it should be
noted that although they howled
long and hard about supposed
infringements on their “constitu-

p frequent
f. rumors about his supposed drink-

. CVCFI

struck down. Among those whom
he offended was President Eisen-
hower, who, while masquarading
as a conservative, refused to
support McCarthy’s reelection bid
in l952..This same man was also
responsible for sabotaging any
Republican support for the sear
at ‘the Army-McCarthy heariﬁgs
and later at the censure proceed-
ings in 1954. Out of these‘ came a
sustained anti-‘McCarthy barrage
from a smallnumber of critics; it
was blown far out of proportion by
slanted press and TV coverage, as
McCarthy’s assistant, Roy Cohn,
proved in his biography of the
senator. Nevertheless, the Senate
passed a measure in December,
1954, “condemning” McCarthy's
activities in defense of our

_ freedoms.

Stripped as he was of his power
and inﬂuence in the Senate, and
shunned by his colleagues, Mc 
thy would seem beaten. But the
polls showed his popularity was
affected only slightly. This caused
the attacks to become even more
and venomous. False

ing habits were given credence by
formerly reputable news sources,
and some even went so low as to
ridicule his-new bride. But through
it all, McCarthy held his head high,
though he was literally
hounded to his grave.

more than 20 years I. ago. One

available to all chapters when
needed (no other faculty
organization can match this colle-
gial infrastructure).

In the Pitt campaign, the issues
are relatively clear, PSEA/NEA
and PPU/AFT represent an indus-
trial model of collective bargaining,
with high dues to support
organizers dedicated to creating

order to justify their existence.
AAUP believes in collective bar-
gaining in order to give the faculty
the legal right under Public Law
195 to negotiate legally binding
working arrangements on campus
and to legalize appropriate self-
governance processes, including
University Senate procedures.
Only modest and occasional outside
legal help is needed in this internal
process.

NEA and AFT traditionally use
the-strike threat in their adversary
approach to collective bargaining.
AAUP/PITT -feels that a strike
threat is not normally a part of
negotiations on campus and should
be used only in rare instances when

inequities. In a competitive,
quality, research institution, we
can see no place for a salary

Both NEA and PPU contracts
usually attempt to deﬁne workload

typically take the position that
appropriate workload is that which

internally through joint faculty and

this internal review has resolved all

both ‘NBA and AFT. ,

Finally. AAUP has been tradi-
tionally active in urging. student
participation in governance pro-

visible record of such support.

Differing Interests

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

As the atmosphere surrounding
the faculty union question reaches
a rather tropical climax. it become
more important for people to
dissect cant and rhetoric and
realize the true situation.

The ﬁrst great myth involved
with the faculty union drive is that
it inevitably will beneﬁt students.
This is false. A faculty union is a
power unto itself, and a tool. How
that tool is used has little or
nothing to do with great, worldwide
philosophies. What beneﬁts.stu-
dents today may not beneﬁt them
tomorrow, and it is a narrow-mind-
ed thinker who would expect any
political situation to remain stable.

Because faculty unions are
responsible to their constituency
(faculty) it is ridiculous to assume
the needs of these always will
coincide with the needs of
students. To embrace blindly the
beneﬁts of unionization is as foolish
as to embrace blindly an-y doctrine.
There inevitably comes a bitter
awakening. A «

Just as a faculty union must
point up the differences between
faculty interests and administration
interests, someone must point up
the differences between faculty
interests and student interests.

The advent of a faculty union is a

One student asked me why 1 was
so apprehensive about faculty
unionization:

“Don't you know the teacher
unions work with nationals like the
AFL-CIO?" he asked.

“What kind of reassurance is
that?" I replied.

“Because the big unions like the
AFL-CIO have consistently come
out for free tuition in higher
education."

“Well. Where is it?"

“Well, the union leaders haven't
pressed it because they're cor-
rupt.”

“So you want that kind of corrupt
leadership on this campus?”

The conversation then degener~
ated into a confusion of political
science shorthand.

Once again the heart of the

faculty union question for students
does not lie along the path of
dogma and half-baked philosophy.
Instead, students must make a
concerted effort to ensure their
voice is heard at the bargaining
table and that their rights are
recognized.
V The faculty union decision is a
power struggle. It will result in a
time of realignment at Pitt. Those
who ignore this and refuse to act in
the student interest will have only
rhetoric to console them when the
day comes and the real world
makes itself heard.

Pitt may have lost a hockey game
to Penn State Sunday night. 4-3.
but they gained something far
more important. team together-
ness. Playing under unusual and
difﬁﬁilt circumstances, these 16
athletes proved to one another that
they can function as an effective
unit. Missing from the Pitt benches
were the coaches and ‘several
players. The latter situation is not a
new one to the Hockey Club this
season. but the former one is as
both coaches could not make the
trip. \

The players. forced to take
command of their predicament, did
so admirably by overcoming an
early 1-O deﬁcit to take 2-1 and 3-2
leads. Even after Penn State
capitalized on a couple of
questionable ofﬁsde plays to steal a
4-3 lead, the Panthers fought down
to their last ‘breath to net the
equalizer. They stormed the
Nittany Lions in the last few
seconds but could not getia shot off
in time. These 16 team members
deserve the respect, admiration,

Human Rights vs.
Property Rights

l'd like to answer a few questions
. that were brought up in a letter in
last Friday's Pitt News. The letter
criticized the Young Socialist
Alliance for our stand against the
military‘s “defense" budget. for
cutting the budgetand putting the
money into education. The letter
claimed that this was just a
“short-term answer" and that in
the long run. we were threatening
our freedom by not putting money
into the defense budget.
The question is : Who does this
budget defend? Not you, not me. lt

defends the interests of a small-

minority-’—this country's ruling 
class. It defends their freedom to 2
exploit workers and steal other 

countries’ natural resources. Their

freedom to steal Angola's oil and 
mooch Chile's copper. The only ‘ '
“freedom

the military budget
defends is the corporate executives
right to make a proﬁt. '

_And they have the nerve to ‘call

Inside The Krishna Temple

Undercover Rtforler

 

BY KEN GORMLEY

A lot of strange people walk the
streets of Oakland. Seedy-looking
characters wearing London Fogs
dart from tree to tree, gleefully
exposing their bare essentials to
shocked onlookers. Glass-eyed
Good Humor men try to sell a hit of
speed with every fudgy-wudgy.
And barefooted Hare Krishna
people prance down Forbes Ave-
nue, shaking tamborines and
chanting to unknown spirits.

Luckily, we have been taught to
be wary of such freaks. Upon
spotting anyone with an unusually
sinister smile or a recently-shaven
head, we immediately bolt for the
opposite side of the street, or stall
for time, window shopping in front
of a Laundromat.

It is only after spending a good
number of months behind a slew of
meaningless textbooks that we can
learn to appreciate insanity. That’s
when we finally begin to wonder if
the strange people walking the
streets of Oakland are any stranger
than ourselves.

HARE KRISHNA—A SOCIETY OF
WEIRDOS?

Actually, the Hare Krishna is not
an organization for the mentally
deranged. Nor is it a subdivision of

the Yul Brenner fan club. The
Hare Krishna Society is a spiritual
movement whose members dedi-
cate their lives to serving God

(Krishna).

Founded in 1966 by His Divine
Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
Prabhupada (ﬁfty cents to anyone
who can say his name backwards)
the Hare Krishna movement has
spread across the nation.

“The bubonic plague has spread
across the entire nation too,” one
might smugly observe. “Who are
these pony-tailed creatures, and
what are they doing in our country?
The immigration officers must have
been asleep. when those creeps
climbed off the boat.”

Let's not be so hasty. Most of
the Krishna devotees are not
foreigners at all, but people born
and bred in the U.S. of A.

“But what about their bald
heads and the pony tails swinging
from the backs of their noggins?”
one might further interject. “If
they’re not from another country,
then they’re in another world.”

Shame on you. A shaven head
and pony tail symbolize the Hare
Krishna follower’s complete dedi-
cation to God, much the same-as
the attire of the priest, minister, or
rabbi symbolizes his commitment.

How do the Hare Krishna
devotees serve God? By harrassing
people on streetcorners to buy
magazines, or dancing across hot
coals‘ in their bare feet? Not at all.
They serve God by providing food
and religious instruction, free of
charge, to anyone who ventures
into their temple.

around his neck, greeted me as I
walked cautiously up to the door.

“Come in,” he said in a far-away
voice, as if contemplating some
other world. “But please take your
shoes off first.”

After reluctantly kicking off my
clod hoppers (I feared they might
be hocked for beads and incense), I
padded into the meeting room. A
plush, gilded throne sat magestic-
ally under a chandelier, and plates
of food (which I assumed were
meant for the bellies’ of Hare
Krishna dogs and cats) lined the
floor. _

“Hi, my name is Adwaita. How

the smiling face of a devotee, who’s
head was shaved so close it would

“Great.

The room was soon filled to the

Adwaita ushered me through the
crowd, and we sat down on the
ﬂoor in front of two plates of dog
food. Cringing in pain, I struggled
to force my legs into lotus position,
so as not to feel out of place.

expected me to eat this slop? It
looked like something that had

Suspiciously, I scooped a tiny
portion of the food onto my spoon,
and dabbed it to my tongue.
Hmmm. It tasted all right—it could
be a trap. .Maybe the crafty
devotees had slipped a potion into
the grub that would make my hair

It wasn't long before my
curiousity got the better of me.
And I was in for a pleasant
surprise. Most of the food was
actually very tasty. (Occasionally, I
did run across something that
tasted like a combination of garlic
and tortoise skin, but it quickly

disappeared under my napkin).

“Most of this stuff is really good,
Adwaita,” I said, slapping my
numb legs which had long ago
fallen asleep. “What is it?”

Adwaita explained that I was
eating Persatum—food prepared
each Sunday in Krishna temples all
over the world, and distributed to
the hungry, like myself.

and popped some sugar-glazed
peanuts into my mouth.

were not hunting for scraps of food
at all. I put my nose to the
linoleum, and occasionally grunted
and groaned so nobody would
suspect I had no experience in
chanting.

brought out a collection of musical
instruments, the likes of which I
hadn’t seen since my kindergarten

I think there's a saying that goes

Swallowing my pride, I started
shaking my. tambourine, and
hopped around from foot to foot
like a crippled ostrich.

Very strange, I thought. Why
are these people praying to a
purple curtain? Iknow that God is
supposed to be everywhere, but
isn’t this going a little too far?

Suddenly, there were several

themselves into a frenzy and the

BeerFlowsIn su Saloon? 

BY DENNIS KELLY

“The Spirits of 76” ﬂowed
yesterday“ at the second annual
Beer Tasting Festival in the
Student Union Ballroom.

The festival, sponsored by the
Student Union Board, featured six‘
different beers: Stroh’s-light and
dark, Old Milwaukee, -Schlitz,
Schlitz Malt and Iron City.

According to Ron Stanko, festival
chairman, the idea was to give
chance to sample
different kinds of beer. However,
most students didn’t seem to care
what brand they drank.

Channel 11 newscaster. Adam
Lynch was the hero of the day,
winning the beer-tasting contest
with the ease acquired from years
of experience.

“When the chips are down I can
hang in there with the best of
them,” Lynch boasted after his
triumph.

The contest required participant
to identify three brands of beer by
taste alone, and, competition was
ﬁerce.

Television personalities Bill Hill-
grove (WTAE). Gre2 Benedetti
(KDKA), Dave Kelly and Lynch
(WIIC) competed along with
Assistant to the Chancllor, Edward
Bozik "and Vice Chancellor of
Business and Finance, Joseph
Dutton.

The ﬁrst round ended in a tie

"among Lynch, Hillgrove and Bozik,

with Lynch emerging victorious
after two more trials.

99‘ Theatre

Ramblers Revive Bluegrass

BY KENNETH L. WAMPLER

The 99 cent Floating Theatre
Festival offered mixed country
music performed by a group called
The Red Clay Ramblers on Tuesday
and Wednesday. Their music was
largely bluegrass but also roamed
into blues, string-band and gospel.

The group of four men—Bill
Hicks, ﬁddle, Jim Watson, mandol-
in and guitar, Mike Craver, piano.
and bass and Tommy Thompson,
banjo and harmonica, are orginally
from Chapel Hill and Durham,
N.C. They are now on a four-month
tour of the Eastern states after a
seven-month run in their own
off-Broadway show.

Bluegrass music hit off-Broad-
way in January, 1975, as part of
Diamond Studs, the Life of Jesse
Jmaes, a Saloon Musical. The
Ramblers performed with another
group ‘from North Carolina—The
Southern States Fidelity Choir. The
show was met with vigor by the
New York critics and audiences,
but after seven months, the tedium
drove the Ramblers to seek new
horizons.

Surely they could have found a
betterrvista than the horizon from
the “stage” of ,David Lawrence
Hall. Sound never having been one
of its better points, thehall did not
lend itself well to the intimacy and
down-home feeling of the even-
ing’s fare. The Ramblers rolled
with the punches.,_;_though,p and
eventually opted for unaided
shouting rather ‘ than ‘unevenly
ampliﬁed, uncountriﬁed‘ and jar-
ring tonal imbalance. The choice
was the lesser of two evils.

Eventually the lights came down,
the toes started tapping and an
easy satisfaction infected good ole
David Lawrence. It never quite
became the Grand Ole Opry with
Jimmie Rogers, but then who
remembers Jimmie Rogers, any-
way?

Last term the 99 Cent Theatre
brought in Paul Posnak, who not
only entertained us but also
educated us in the history and
growth of ragtime. Perhaps I have
been spoiled, but I would have
welcomed the same treatment of
bluegrass by The Red Clay
Ramblers. You hear the terms

ragtime, honky tonk, rinky tink,
bluegrass, blues, and country and
western, but do you know where
one leaves off and the other
begins?

Bluegrass caught on and seems
to be enjoying a second‘ heyday
now. What could be the reason?
Dreams of days gone by? Remem-
bered names and faces from the
past? The fantasized comforts of a
home without the complications of
a modern age? Listen to the songs
The Ramblers sing: “A Call From
My Ole Cabin Home,” “Fifty
Miles of Elbow Room” and
“Telephone Girl.” ’

Bob Artis, author of the book
Bluegrass, says: “It’s a healthy
and predictable reaction to the
super-cynical age of future shock

and Alice Cooper." Whatever the-

reason, the turkey-goblin’, chic-
ken-peckin’ rhythm of a banjo
chasing a mandolin down the creek
and across the bottom 40 reclaimed
another small portion of lost sheep

Quicksilver At Pitt 

Barefoot Jerry and Quicksilver
Messenger Service will be appear-
ing Sunday evening in the David
Lawrence Hall Auditorium. Spon-
sored by Pitt Programming, the
acts will appear in two shows, at
7:30 and 10. Admission is $2 with
ID.

Both bands are San Francisco-
based but are very different in their
approach to musical expression.
Barefoot Jerry is primarily a
country-rock band but upon listen-
ing to its albums, one cannot really
separate it from other genres. The
remarkable pedal-steel work gives
the flair and bounce of country, but
the intricate rhythms and ﬂash of
the guitarists lend a jazz ﬂavor.

Its latest_album, Barefoot Jerry’s
Grocery, is a repackage of its ﬁrst
two, Can’t Get Off With Your
Shoes On and most popular album,

. Watching TV With the Radio On.

You always can be assured that a
Barefoot Jerry tune will be heard

on your old buddy Herschel’s"

- Teachers for an Independent Faculty

Who Are the Teachers foran Independent Faculty?

"Several weeks ago we distributed the following statement and a list of

colleagues who endorsed it on the basis of a very quick survey of facul-
ty opinion. We also attached a form on which like-minded faculty could

express their sentiments. We present the statement again here with an

updated list of those who have asked to be identiﬁed with the NO
AGENT position. We have also received a number of forms which have
been returned by people who intend to vote for NO AGENT but who
do not wish to be so identified in public.

A number of recentpublished statements and letters show there are

some serious misconceptions about TIF. We are an informal grass-roots

movement in the Provost's area operating with a minimum organization
on a minimum budget. We have no head, no chairperson, no hierarchy-
only a steering committee which would be glad to include any like-

minded people who are ready to give two or three hours a week during .

the next month.

, We have nothing particular in common except membership in the Pitt

Faculty and ’a skepticism about the value of unionism to our University
at this time. Our attitudes towards the Administration cover the entire
range of faculty opinion from warmly supportive to openly hostile. We
hope that ourjob on the collective bargaining issue will be completed
when a solid NO REPRESENTATIVE majority vote is counted in
March. If you feel that way too, why not let us know about it so that
you can help strengthen the resolve of your colleagues who really don't
want a union but are on the fence. ‘

Dear Colleagues:
Before long the faculty of the University of Pittsburgh must make one

of the most critical andsfar-reaching decisions it has ever faced: whether I

or not to be represented by a collective bargaining agent. Some of our
colleagues—those active in or supportive of the union groups—believe
that unionization, with the restructuring of relationships within the uni-
versity that it entails, will best serve’ the needs and interests of the fac-
ulty. Over the past year they have tried to persuade the faculty, through
mailings and meetings, of the expedience of their‘views. Like ourselves,
they seek to promote the well-being of the faculty and the students. We

. agree with them on ends but disagree over means. Aware that collective

bargaining in universities is a complex matter of such limited and recent
experience that thoughtful persons can come to incompatible conclu-
sions, we nevertheless question the pragmatic judgment of these col-
leagues that unionization will best serve the interests of the faculty and
students of the'University of Pittsburgh. We believe that it will not.

'. Like our union-oriented colleagues, we are disconcerted by some prac-
tices and trends at Pitt. Unlike these colleagues, we do not believe that

circumstances have reached such a state that another bureaucracy is
needed to manage our affairs. Insofar as these matters are tractable, we

’ believe that a vigilant and‘ independent faculty can resolve them with-

out a union, hence without incurring that extra burden of difficulties
and drawbacks inherent in collective bargaining.

We would like to persuade the faculty ofvthe correctness of our prag-
matic conclusion that more would be lost than gained at this time by
unionizing, and hence they should cast “NO AGENT” votes in the up-
coming election. I

To present our point of view and to help the faculty sort out fact from
ﬁction on the issues raised by collective bargaining, we plan to issue
bulletins from time to time and to hold public meetings. Unfortunately
our resources are meager and time is short. Unlike the union groups and
the Administration, we have no organization behind us to finance-our

' activities or to supply services and resource personnel. We are what our

name connotes, individual ‘teachers committed to preserving an inde-
pendent faculty. If your reflective judgment coincides with our position
as outlined herein, we earnestly invite your active cooperation and/or
participation in our efforts topreserve an independent faculty.

Keep Paying Off  

TBY YAIER LEHRER
Associate Sports Editor

When coach Dick Bradshaw came to Pitt, the school had not known a
winning swim team in quite a number of years, but now, in his ﬁfth
season, Bradshaw’s swimmers have posted their fourth winning record
in ﬁve years, not to mention that the Panthers are the best swimming
team in the East.

Unfortunately, the fact that swimming is a non-revenue sport has
/kept the tankers from receiving the attention they rightfully deserve.
I Only every four years are sports such as track, swimming, diving,
gymnastics and fencing given any publicity, and that is only because of
the Olympics. -

But even without the attention, the Panthers have not lost more than

if three meets in any of the past three years, and although they have not

reached the plateaus of teams such as Indiana and USC, they have
inched closer every year.

The Cats had their first winning season in along time in 1973 when
they posted a 6-5 record, and it’s been uphill ever since. This year, in
their fourth winning season in a row, the Cats have managed to batter

every Eastern opponent and last week came withing one point of .

defeating the No. 9 swim team in the country.
One of the big reasons for this season's success has been Jerry

 . DeMuro. Against Ohio State, DeMuro easily beat Tracy Smith in the

500- and 1,000-yard freestyles, not to mention his voctory in the

A 9. 200-yard butterﬂy.

DeMuro is the product of one of Bradshaw’s greatest strengths-
recruiting. DeMuro himself. was a prep school All-American at St.
_Joe’s Prep in Philadelphia. Bradshaw’s ability to bring blue-chip
prospects like DeMuro to Pitt is probably the biggest.reason for his
success.

Another contributor to the Panther successhas been diving coach Al
Coffey. ‘

Coffey has coached Panther divers into the'NCAAs and personally
has promised there will be an All-American diver from Pit_t within the
next two years. His two candidates are Tom Fatyol and Dave Reeder.
Fatyol performed well last Saturday, falling just short of beating Ohin
State’s Tim Fox. Ohio State traditionally has had the best divers in the
country, and to even come close to tnem is an accomplishment.

I must take issue with a remark by the Cleveland State coach at
Saturday’s triangular meet. He said Pitt’s divers were not even in the
class of Ohio State’s. Nothing could be further from the truth. ‘

That Fatyol and Jeff Miller were so close to Fox in the three-meter
and Reeder’s controversial ‘ win in the one-meter discredit that
statement.

It was not very long ago that Pitt was in the same position in which
hapless Cleveland State now ﬁnds itself, providing comic relief for the

- really good teams. Now with swimmers like DeMuro, Carlos Santiago,

Neal Wallace and Steve Leach, the Panthers are becoming one of the
more powerful swim teams around, and with Bradshaw’s guidance
there is no limit the program can't reach.

‘In Monday's Pitt News, it was erroneously printed that Bob
Greenwald did not win third place in the 500-yard freestyle, when in
fact he did. Also, Neal Wallace placed in the backstroke, not Eric
.Wallace.

The Panthers took out the wrath
caused by an uneventful, down-
right disappointing basketball sea-
son on the Buffalo State Bengals
Wednesday night, but fell just shy
of their ﬁrst century-mark of the

season. But that was the only

disappointment in the Panthers’

- 99-51 tour de force, presented for

the enjoyment of the 1,500 fans at
the Field House.
The Cats shot just under 62%

from the ﬁeld, as compared to the
33% shooting for the Bengals. The
Panther defense, which always
seems to be in ﬁne form, was at its
best on Wednesday, as the Cats
caused 27 Buffalo State turnovers
with their relentless pressure.
Actually, the game appeared to
be a close for part of the ﬁrst half.
The Panthers’ top scorer, Larry
Harris, spent the ﬁrst 10 minutes
on the bench.
A The reason: Harris was evidently
late for practice Monday afternoon

having been caught in trafﬁc on his-

way back to’ Pittsburgh from his
home in Lorain, Ohio.

With Harris into the lineup, and
the Cats holding an eight-point

lead, the Panthers slowly pulled .'

away, and led Buffalo, 47-33, at the
half. -

The second half was not quite as
close, unfortunately, for Buffalo
State. Pitt outmuscled the hapless
Bengals, scored the ﬁrst 15'points
of _the second half and completely
dominated the half,
Buffalo, 52-18.,

Tom Richards, enjoying what is

outscoring -

left of his senior year after being
hampered by injuries all season, hit
on seven of eight shots and added a
free throw for total of 15, high for

the Cats.
Oleh Czmola, a 6-7 forward, was

top scorer for the game with 19.

Czmola was perhaps the only

consolation for Buffalo coach Tom

Borschel could retrieve from such

a thrashing, as he saw his evidently

outclassed squad drop to 15-7.
The Panthers are now 9-15.

McClelland is still happy to be
there.

At ﬁrst glance, McClelland’s
season would appear to have been
longer than most. A senior who

was expected to carry Pitt’s load.

underneath, McClelland has failed
to live up to those pre-season
expectations. A nagging calcium
deposit in his right upper arm and
some inconsistent play when he has
been in the lineup have combined
to limit his effectiveness. But
McClelland is not one to complain.
“When 'l’ve played well, I've
played,” he said. “When I’ve
played badly, I haven't played.”
'McClelland won"t' complain,
because, despite his domineering
physical appearance, he is a
likeable guy. Talking with him,
you can't help but notice his
reluctance to speak out_ against
things-—he’d much rather be
positive. '
“I think that some good things

have come out of our season,”

McClelland said. Some‘ of the
younger kids, like Wayne Will-
iams, have gotten a chance to gain
some valuable experience. We’ve
learned how to win and lose as a
team. We’ve learned how to deal
with disappointment. I know I set
some goals before the season and
haven’t come close to what I
thought I could do.”

If McClelland sounds like a
coach, it’s no coincidence.
Teaching high-school history and
coaching high-school basketball-
ideally in Pittsburgh’-s City League,

since he graduated from Alle-

gheny—are two of Ralph McClel-
land’s aspirations.

“Basketball has really done a lot
for me,” he said, “It got me an
education.” “I didn’t really care

‘for school in high-school. In- fact, I

wasn’t even in the academic
curriculum. But I went to
Allegheny Community College
(ACC) and started to like school.

Now at Pitt, I've come to enjoy

education enough that I'd like to

teach.”

McClelland spent two years at
ACC before coming to "Pitt, but
those two‘years were not the
vacation you might assume them to
be. ’

“I found the-courses at ACC just 1

as hard as the ones here at Pitt,”
McClelland said. “The classes
were smaller and the professors
made you work.”

McClelland made'ACC his first
stop after high school in order that

he might be close to home and his ‘

ailing mother. He has worked hard
in and out of school his summer

' employment is with a construction

company) but is happy with his
decision to attend Pitt.

“I’ve really enjoyed myself at
Pitt,” he said., “I’ve met the nicest
people I'd ever want to meet
here.”- .

McClelland’s stay at Pitt is
almost over, and his future plans-
are much different than they were
when he was learning to be a
sheet-metal worker in high school.
They even go beyond his desires to
teach and coach.

“I want to keep on playing if I
can. You just'can’t quit one day
after playing all of your life.
like to try and go to Europe, and
maybe try pro ball over there.”

“I've gotten a lot out of
basketball. Besides the things it's
taught me, and the education, and
the experiences, it’s a lot of fun;
It's relaxing for me. ljust enjoy
playing." ,

p Matmen Study History

BY JIM LEWIS

History repeats itself.

Last year at this time, the Pitt
wrestling team, with a slightly
impressive 7-4 record, was a
tremendous underdog to national
power Penn State. _

The Nittany Lions were having a
great season, enjoying national

fame as one of the best wrestling,

teams in America and breezing
along in the second half of the year
preparing for the "NCAA Cham-
pionships.

Q 1 Pitt Set To “Duke” It Out

against Duquesue, the Hockey
Club will travel to ’Annapolis*,
Maryland to face a tough Navy
squad, then to Washington,‘ D.C.
for a contest with an amateur team.

The alumni of the Pitt and
Duquesne_ hockey teams of 1938-39
will be honored -in pre-game
ceremonies Saturday. The two
teams of that year played to a 1-1
tie after ﬁve overtime periods and a_

totalbf l55.minutes of playing time,
at the old Duquesne_Gar.dens., The '

ga_me- was ‘called due to ’--the

- M exhaustion ‘of the players.

These two opposites met in the
ﬁnal meet .\of the season—the
Panthers with nothing to lose, the
Nittany Lions with everything to
gain.

And surprise! Pitt won, 22-17.

So tomorrow will be like a
recurring dream for Pitt, which will
visit heavily favored Penn State as
a tremendous underdog again, a
role it’s lived through before. '

However, this year history may
be rewritten. ‘

Penn State is enjoying an even
bigger and better season. Not only
are the Lions_ ranked seventh
nationally, but also they are
undefeated in the brand new
Eastern Wrestling League and
recently obliterated Lock Haven,
44-3. ’

Penn State’s lineup is ominously
solid; 118-pounder Wayne Pack-
ard, 177-pounder Jerry White and
190-pounder Bill 'Berterand leave
their opponents feeling like'they’ve
just been crushed’ by Plymouth
Rock..

In "short, _they’_re a heck of a
team. - ' '

.- But Pitt (12-3) -is no slouch. «

The Panthers have had aataste of
national ranking themselves and
should give the Lions tons of
trouble. True, All‘-American Rande

-Stottlemyer and Bob Bailey are

doubtful for the meet, but Pitt’s
subs have proved they can plug the
holes in the Panthers’
lineup. '

In the!West Virginia meet (Pitt

won, 25-11), George Soergel, Bill _

Korth and Bob Kebr scored
impressive victories.
Add them to an already

tenacious’ team including Kevin
Nellis; Bill Bailey, Ray Dallatore,
Dave Grau, George O’Korn, Milt
Schuler and Craig Phillips (the
Panthers’ probably starting line-
up), and anything can happen-
seventh-ranked or no.

Pitt’s hopes of victory will be

flying higher than John Glenn -

tomorrow; a win will give them a
share with Penn State of the first
Eastern Wrestling League title in
history and provide great conﬁ-

dence for the Eastern Wrestling
,L__eague ﬁnals, in which the- teams

that‘will qualify ‘for the NCAA’

Next Stop: Penn State

BY TOM HALL
Sports Editor

For the second time during the
1975-76 Panther basketball cam-
paign, the Cats will have the Penn
State Nittany Lions to keep them
company. Hoping the Lions can be
as gracious as before might be a bit
too much.

ln their first meeting, the
Panthers dominated every phase of

the game and handed the Lions a
71-52 thrashing. The result could
have been much worse, as Larry
Harris sat out the last seven
of the game after
“collecting 27 points.

But there is one factor that will
go against the Cats this time.
Instead of cheering crowds, Penn
State's Rec Hall will be packed with
7.000-plus fans screaming for the
Panthers’ heads.

The Lions are coming off one of
their better performances of the
year, a 103-87 loss to West Virginia
at WVU Coliseum. As dismal as
the Panthers have had it this year,
the Lions have fared no better in
the “good luck" department.

The Lions’ prize center, Romel
Raffm, the man who was expected
to take up the slack left by the

graduation of Randy Meister, was
lost early in the season through
injuries. .

Things have gone downhill for
the fans on Mt. Nittany ever since.

But there has been one saving
grace for this year. Chris Erichsen,
a 6-6 forward, has become the
shining light in the dark skies’ of
Penn State coach John Bach.

Other Lions who could give the
Panthers a few headaches this time
around are Dave Angstadt, a 6-8
forward who led the Lion attack
against the Cats when they first
met in the Pennsylvania Classic.

Carvin Jefferson, PSU’s 6-8
center, scored 21 points and was
the Lions’ top scorer in their loss to
WVU on Wednesday. He was not a
factor in the Pitt win, but has
improved since. V

Lion point-guard Jim Ouderkir
is a hot-cold shooter. he totaled 19
against WVU, but just couldn’t
handle the “amoeba.”

But then, it’s not the Panther
defense that's responsible for the
9-15 record. It’s the lackluster
offense.

Hopefully the Cats will be able to
keep up the 62% they had against
Buffalo State.

at PATTY TASCARELLA

The Pantherette basketball team
notched up anothe_r mark in the win
column Tuesday night by crushing
hapless Robert Morris, 62-24. Pitt,
now 12-5 for the season, proved

. once and for all the top women's

team in the city.

“We used our half-court press
and it broke the game wide open,”
Pantherette coach Pat Wallace said
jokingly.

Robert Morris’ statistics are
eloquent. The team connected on
eight field goals and went 8 for 21
from the free throw line.

Pitt led the rebounding category,
collecting 54 to Robert Morris’ 19.
Debbie Jones grabbed 15 of the
Pantherettes’ rebounds, and Kit
Loeffler and Kate Szramowski each
collected seven.

Jones also topped all scorers
with 14 points, and Mimi Senkow-
ski chipped in eight.

The Pantherettes will wind up
the away games when they travel to
Lock Haven and Penn State. Pitt
has played three consecutive
weekends of back-to-back games—-
not the easiest way to a winning
season.

“But whenever you have to put
everything out like we did last week
against St. Joseph's, it’s hard.
Everyone’s tired and you don’t
have preparation time.”

As for Lock Haven and PSU (who
also fell to Slippery Rock), Wallace

THERE’S A HITCH TO EVERY
' HIKE

SEATTLE (AP)—The size of a
women's bust is an important
factor in whether she gets rides
while hitch hiking, a University of
Washington researcher says.

Dr. Joan Lockard, professor

_ 4-:

neurological surgery and psychol.‘~..«..

ogy, says experiments she con-
ducted last year showed women
doubled the number of rides they
obtained by using padding to
increase their bustline by two
inches.

When not wearing padding, the
women received rides from about
one in 10 passing male motorists.
With the extra two inches they got
rides from one in ﬁve’. _

The experiment was among
several designed to study the effect
of ‘body language on human
relationships. Dr. Lockard said
there will be an effort to match the

bustline experiment by having.,—.

male students test whether exp
mg more chest hair brings a better
response. ‘
