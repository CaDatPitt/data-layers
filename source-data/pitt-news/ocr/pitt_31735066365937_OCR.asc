  SDS members arrested
forposting signs B

by DAVE BLUEY

The posting of two signs on
the Cathedral of Learning pro-
testing the Vietnam war, ROTC,
and calling for a student strike,
led _to'th'e arrest of three mem-
bers of the Students for a Dem-
ocratic Society by the Campus
Police. The arrest took place
Thursday morning, April 27. at 1
a.m. and on May 1, the three were
held for‘ Grand Jury in Magis-
trate's Court. .

According to Alden Bowen.
Campus Judicial Officer. the
three people were confronted by
Officer Pendergrast of the Cam-
pus Police Force and asked if they

"1 have not seen signs of co-educational institutions stepping up to
women‘s educational needs." said Dr. Barbara Newell,'newly appoint-

ed president of Wellesley College

their population in studies.-"

Dr. Newell, presently Associate
Provost for Graduate Research
and Study and‘Professor of Eco-
nomics at Pitt. defended the legi-
timacy of Women's Studies pro-
grams.

“Any type of curriculum change
and focus which will increase the

consciousness of academics, the,

awareness of women’s problems
performs a _ valuable function,”
she said. “I believe .we need to do
considerably more.”

As assistant to the president at
the University of Michigan. Dr.
Newell was instrumental in for-
mulating an affirmative action
program for the employment of
women at the University.

Explaining that "basic goals
are increasing." she defined the
premises of the program as em-

"Thereis a very real need for re-
search in areas involving women."

she continued. "Universities fre-

ployment and opportunities for
advancement for w o m e n a n d
other minorities.

Because of her short appoint-

ment here, Dr. Newell was admit- '

tedly uninvolved in Pitt’s Affir-
mative Action program. She noted
that Pitt’s program was well-
known for it’s review of academ-
ic concerns of women as well as
employment concerns.

’ Regarding the possibility of
tokenism becoming involved when
quotas are set. Newell answered.
"I‘m sure it exists.

"I prefer to think of the stan-'

dards set not as quotas but as tar-
gets or goals of institutions.

“Obviously, the long run ob-
jective is to try and make employ-
ment available.to all,” she con-
cluded. ‘

Walgrert protests election,
claims poor ballot positions

\\'ASHlNGTO.\' (AP: — Repre-
sentative-elect William Conover
(R.-Pa.) was not sworn in to Con-
gress Tuesday as scheduled be-
cause his opponent has contested
the election. .

Conover thought he was going to
be sworn in "until I heard them
adjourn." he told a news confer-
ence. _

However, House Speaker Carl
Albert said there was no certi-
ficate of election from Pennsyl-
vania because there has been a
challenge to Conover’s_ election.
Albert said he could not adminis-
ter the oath of office to Conover.

Albert was notified by Douglas
Walgren. Conover's Democratic
opponent in the election to fill the
seat of the late Representative
James G. Fulton (R.-Pa.» that he
was filing a challenge to the elec-
tion because of hisyosition on the
ballot. \ » " ’

"1 don’t know what he hopes to
gain." Conover told a news con-
ference. ‘'1 think its a tragedy that

He said he expects to be sworn

NEWELL ‘
"Because of /the intangibles in
measuring ability oursociety has
traditionally "made allocations of

jobs according to stereotypes“.

Newell continued. V

She felt the Affirmative Action
program wasa good system "try-
ing to help break these long held
stereotypes."

As assistant to the Chancellor
at the University of Wisconsin Dr.
Newell initiated experimental
programs in undergraduate edu-
cation and .studied the teaching
assistant system.

"We were very much concern-
ed at Wisconsin with what is the
nature of the undergraduate aca-
demic experience. Teaching as-
sistants are very much a part of
it.“

The study "involved an elabor-
ate set-up.“ taking into consider-
ation job security. teaching as-
signments andgraduate obliga-
tions. It tried to "aid the system
inimproving quality of education
for both graduates and undergrad-
uates.“ '

Dr. Newell has taught at the
University of Wisconsin and Pu_r-
due University, as well as holding
administrative positions at the
Universities of Wisconsin and
Michigan, before coming to Pitt
last October. A

Dr. Newell. whose appointment
becomes effective Sept. 1. looks
forward to "being in a women‘s
institution in the 1970's."

"Throughout history womens
schools have played a major part
in human rights and advance-
ment. 1 hope Wellesley can play a
leading role again and become a
piloter model in education and en-
vironment." she said.

Last year Wellesley 'voted down
a motion to make it a coeducation-

al. institution, retaining their pm‘
_ licy—not to grant degrees to men.

 
 

were students at the University.
At this time they denied any con-
nection with the University. When
Pendergrast arrested them and
informed them of their rights,
they turned around and claimed
student status.

“This put the officer into a sit-
uation where he had to follow
through with the arrest,” Bowen
said. “If he would have rescinded
the arrest, hewould have opened
himself up for charges of false ar-
rest,” he further explained.

Bowen completely feels that

Pendergrast legitimately had the ‘

right to protect himself-from a
law suit. Bowen also backs Pen-
dergrast's move in taking the
matter before Magistrate Bar-
rante for the preliminary hearing.

"He had to go that far,“ Bowen

‘stated. “For the‘-same reasons

he couldn‘t walk away from them
on the campus.“

Bowen has also looked for con-
formation on the accused people’s
status at the University. Student
Accounts and Records could not
come up with evidence supporting
their claims that. they are stu-
dents at Pitt, even though they
presented identification cards at

Pitt students malﬂi bid
- for elected     B

by RICH EULER

‘Several members of the Col-
lege Young Democrats, including
some Pitt students. have been
elected to key positions in the par-
ty for the upcoming elections. _

Elected as delegates to the Na-
tional Convention in Miami were

Harris Miller. aiUni_versity stu-

' dent and McGovern.pledge. and

Paul Stevenson. a Humphrey
pledge. Also. Francis Baueijwas
elected as an alternate delegate
for McGovern.

Chosen as local committeeman
were Lud Hanczar of Carnegie,
Mike Flanagan of Mt. Lebanon,
and Martin (Sam) Rosenzweig of
Oakland, all students at Pitt. Joe
Evich of South Side was also
elected.

Mike Schubert was selected as
a state committeeman.

Harris Miller. looking forward
to the National Convention, said
that he did not become involved in
in a lot»of campaigning for his
position. "I attended some poli-
tical and social functions,“ he con-
ceded. “and made a few extem-
poraneous speeches." but added
that he had not outlined any speci-
fic campaign plans.

The committeemen, Hanczar,
Flanagan, and Rosenzweig, ran
campaigns on a minor scale. All
advertised their campaigns by
means of hand bills, letters, and
advertisements in their local
newspapers. _

Rosenzweig added that he cam-
paigned along with Martha Gar-
vey. who was running for the com-

mitteewomen post in the same

district. Mike Flanagan canvass-
ed his district door-to—door, as-

sisted by his brother. Lud Han-_

   

 

czar, however, had'the most uni- V

 

the time of their arrest. But even 
Bowen questions the University’s ’
records, because they have been

known to be incomplete in the past. a

Bowen also feels that the SDS
affiliation had nothing to do with y _.
the arrest. He believes that Pen- ’ 
dergrast didn't know . that they. 
three were members of the SDS
and that he doesn’t even know
what the SDS is.

"The University has an obliga-
tion to protect the officer," Bow-,
en concluded. /

Joseph Gil, superintendent of  
Campus Police, feels that the offié ._ ‘ "
cer carried out his duties. He ex-
plained that numerous incidents
involving the posting of signs and »
slogans on the Cathedral of Learn- “ ~
ing has prompted him to give or- "‘ T
ders to his officers to arrest any -_ 
violators of this sort. ' *

"especially the anti-Semitic slo- ‘
gans and signs."

of the incident, but pointed out‘
that only the female did not claim .

que campaign aid. ‘'1 used to be-a
newspaper boy in the area," he
commented, "and I think a lot of
voters remembered me from, _,
that."  ’_  

Regarding his duties, Miller
mentioned the convention, of"
course, and added that the bloc of -
137 delegates chosen last Tuesday
have an obligation to elect 45-50'
more delegates by May 25,

Ron Brown, president of the
College Young Democrats (CYD),
anticipated that these elections
would prove to be very interest-
ing. “None of the candidates was
able to gain a majority in the first
election,” Brown said, “and it .
should be fascinating to which ' :
delegates get elected.” ‘ ‘

While their obligations are-not
as spectacular as those of a na-.
tional delegate, the local commit-
teemen also‘ have definite respon- _ .‘

(Continued from Page I)

“The officer was confronted
with two levels of justice,” he ex-
plained. “How could he arrest the
girl and leave the other two off?”
he continued.

Gil describes Pendergrast as
an officer that is especially inter-
ested in students that does not
want to create problems for them.

Bob Ging, spokesman, for the
Legal Awareness Committee.
which is handling the case for
the accused people, stated, "1

don‘t see why the officer didn‘t ‘

simply tell them to take down the
two signs and to not put~up any
more of them.”

He feels that even if they were
apprehended they should have
went through the University Ju-
dicial System. Ging pointed out
that all three presented the Cam-
pus Police .with University identi-
fication cards with one even be-
ing validated for the spring ses-

 

sion.

He explained that the reason
the girl said she wasn’t a student
was because she wasn’t taking
any courses this summer.

Ging also revealed a finding in
a magistrate’s court known as a
"judgement without prejudice."

“This means that the students
could agree in writing not to press
false arrest charges on the offi-
cer,” he explained. '

He also pointed out that at the
preliminary hearing the magis-
trate asked several times if the
University was really willing to
prosecute in this case. .

Ging brought out the fact tha
in less than 12 hours after the
hearing the students apartment
was raided by members of the or-
ganized crime division of the
Pittsburgh police. The police car-
ried a warrant allowing them spe-
cifically to look for documents
and papers.

The awards were given for
scholastic superiority and Jeader-

(the committeeman) has to serve.
the people in the interest of the

party.“

With the exception of Mike Flan-
gan, who has pledged himself to
Muskie, all the Pitt students have
endorsed the McGovern platform.
In explaining his preference, Flan-
agan stated that Muskie gave
what he considered “the most
non-political, candid answers to
questions.” Flanagan also stated
that he was not discouraged by
Muskies showing in the primaries
and blamed the media and the
Shapp organizationfor his failure

Harris Miller, however. sees
the Muskie showing as a promis-
ing signs for the McGovern sup-
porters. He also stated that Mus-

Miller.

.e.nurelpoIi’cy U fair

The ‘policy used by departments of the University _in granting
tenure,to.assistant professors at the end of their sixth year of service
has recently come under fire from many undergraduates, who claim
that the tenure recommendations made by the full and associate pro-
fessors in the candidate’s department are not made in the best inter-
ests_of the undergraduate student body, but for the well being and pres-
tigeof the department. - ’

'4 7 At present, tenure decisions are officially made _by the Provost
on the basis of a recommendation from the Faculty of Arts and Sciences
j‘ Dean, who bases his recommendation on the findings of an ad hoc com-
mittee made up of members from departments other than that of the
candidate, who base their decisions ‘on: the recommendations made by
professors in the candidate’s department.

 Guidelines from the FAS Dean indicate that the departmental de-
cision should bebased on the teaching load, significant community
work, undergraduate opinion, quality of teaching and productivity.
 Unfortunately undergraduates and the candidate’s departmental
‘peers do not often agree on the definition of productivity. Undergrad-
uatesare likely to consider the breath and quality of the instructors
-teaching the most effective measure of his productivity, while the pro-
-fessors of the department are often more interested in the number of
papers published by the candidate in significant publications or the size
of the candidate’s research grant.

_ ,It is no secret that the prestige of a department is largely de-
-termined by the research of its staff, rather than by the quality of un-
dergraduate teaching. One can scarcely blame the previopsly tenured
professors-for trying to upgrade the quality of their departments by
{granting tenure only to those candidates who are performing “produc-
.ti’ve research.”

,_ But one cannot-help but wonder how often the rumors of depart-
‘ mental backstabbing and professional jealousy are justified.

‘Until recently no attempt was made to sincerely consider the opin-
ions of students, those most directly effected by faculty changes. In
some instances surveys were made, but no one can evaluate how great-
'ly they influenced the departmental decisions. -

_ A case in point is the recent tenure recommendations made by
W‘ members of the Biology Department regarding four assistant profes-
gsors. Several weeks prior to the decision a survey was made of under-
graduate opinion of the four individuals by Tri Beta, the Biology hon-
F orary. The results of the survey were supplied to all full and associate
_' _ Biology professors, who have votes on tenure decisions.

__ "Although the department will not release the results of this survey
“(or-the results of the departmental vote) prior to the Dean's decision,
: . it is certain that two of the candidates who were not recommended for
 tenure received favorable recommendations from the students.

One of the candidates regularly taught a course with as many as
‘A -300-students (complete with lab) and openly showed his concern for stu-
dents and undergraduate teaching. He was regarded by students as a
departmental workhorse.

  
 
  
  
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
 
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
  
  

The second candidate was in charge of departmental advising and
was well-known for her sincere concern for her advisees and for the
quality of the information and counseling she presented. Her course
was highly recommended by former students.

Most Biology undergraduates are dissatisfiedwith the decision,of
the department.

is Many professors maintain their affiliation with the University only
to facilitate their research and regard their teaching duties as mill.-

highly regarded by their peers, and they frequently receive tenure.
No undergraduate wishes to see their department lose its stature

[given to the quality of teaching.

”' Some professors do research that is so valuable and prestigous

that their teaching inadequacies must be overlooked for the welfare

 of the department. Other professors are able’ to strike a2 happy medi-
' um which facilitates both teaching and research.

But there should also be room for professors who wish to dedi-
cate themselves to their teaching duties, which is, after all, the chief
A concern of the University. This is especially important in a major uni-
 versity where one professor is likely to have large classes and will

, effect many students.

Obviously student opinion is the beat measure of teaching ability.
Because in many cases associate and full professors seem unwill-

The 1972 election schedule

All of the big hitters were on
the line-up in Pennsylvania. Hu-
bert Humphrey, shooting for the
first primary victory of his car-
eer, campaigned long and hard
at shopping centers and street
corners across the state. George
McGovern made - appearances
before pensioners and "union lead-

but Coach Shapp was unable to
pull the Muskie team out of a
disastrous slump.

Yet even for the mo_st ardent of
enthusiasts the primary game
was a tough/one to follow. Inten-
sive campaigning in‘ the final
two weeks put the candidates on
the front pages, but the cam-
paign itself was a very super-
ficial affair. A handful of radio

to the steelworkers’ union mem-
bership urged support for Sena-

domly attached to telephone poles
and literature stuck under wind-

 Realsim and comi/non sense

By HARRY MORRISON
Special to the Pitt News

~(Editors Note: Mr. Morrison was
one of the organizers of the first
the Westing-
house plant in East Pittsburgh
where-he was a tool maker for 35
years. He has written this paper
on the problems of organized
labor based upon hisexperiences
as a union member. This is the
conclusion of a two part conden-
sation.) ~

Many people believe that the
higher prices of manufactured
articles are not the -result of the-
higher wages that the union work-
ers" receive, because the improv-
ed methods of production can
absorb the cost of higher wages
that the -manufacturer” pays the
workers- '

Strikes cause great damage to
the companies which must make
a profit in order to exist. The high-
er wages workers get through
protracted and wild cat strikes
lead to higher prices on manufac-
tured articles. Aside from higher
prices that must be paid because
of the resulting wage» hike, the
workers lose a great deal of
working time. The higher inflated
prices then fall harder on the
worker. '

  Qéremiiu iﬁillage Gene mater

The non union workers are hit
harder still because they have to
pay the higher prices without the
wage increases. '

Therefore’ the poor population
becomes increasingly poorer ev-
ery time the unions get a pay raise
or longer vacations.

These difficulties can be avoid-
ed if labor and management set-
tle differences of opinion in a
labor court instead of going on
strike. The justices of this labor
court should consist of represen-
tatives of labor management and
the government. There should
also be a labor supreme court
where decisions. of the lower
court can be appealed.

‘The workers realize that in
their fight against the employers
they are usually the losers and
will willingly support a move-
ment that will guarantee their
security.

Manufacturers arealso inter-
ested in the workers prosperity
because they are also consum-
ers, so manufacturers would sup-
port such a movement. '

An analogy can be drawn*be-
tween the present plight of farm-
workers and the laborers in the
pre-union times. _The boycott by
the grape "workers union was

 

PITT $TuDEN1'5...
DANGER’

 

largely successful, but reduced
the chances of the workers for
getting their wage increases as
the profits of the farm owners
were damaged by the boycott.

The means employed so far to
curb inflation have been unsuc-
cessful. We need to obtain a large
sum of money very _rapidly in
order to destroy poverty. Such
money can be obtained by im-

posing an emergency ,tax upon

the very_ rich. A 25% tax should
be levied on the first tenmillion
above one million that. is earn-

‘ ed. A 50% tax should be levied

on earnings over 10 million.

It may also prove necessary
to tax the surpluses of corpora-
tions. '

These taxes can be paid" part-
ly in cash and partly in commod-
ities which the government can
later convert to cash.

When the unionization which
I have suggested is a fact the
government will have to control,

the profits of manufacturers and_
businesses. Such action will re- '

duce the cost of living.

‘ The process of automation should
not be slowed. Persons displaced
by automation should be retrain-
ed by the government. When we
are able to produce more than
we can consume through auto-

mation, it will be necessary to\

reduce working hours and arrange
more holidays and longer vaca-
tions.

In the future these reforms will
benefit all workers.

The program which I propose
is not communism for it does not
make workers surrender their
rights. When this program is
accepted it will-abolish poverty-
and many of the other ills which
plague our society;

 Administration must

improve Towers Dorms

by DAVE BLUEY

The situation that has develop-
ed in the Towers dormitories. re-
garding vandalism and general
disrepair. is certainl_v one of the
big problems that the Universi-
t_v's administration must remedy
in the very near future.

‘Elevators constantly breaking
down. trash strewn throughout
the halls and stairwells‘. obscene
literature adorning most of the
walls. missing light and wash-
room fixtures. a food service that
adds to its menu roaches. flies.
worms, green meat and other as-
sorted goodies. maids and main-
tenance men that are never there
when you need them. RA‘s who
are seldom seen or heard from.
and a Housing Office that seems
almost totally unresponsive to
students comfort and needs are a

few of the areas that need to be’

examined.

The Chancellor has toured the
dormitories and most of these sore
‘spots were brought to his atten-
tion by members of the Student

Government and Housing Boards.
The students have shown a deep
concern and disatisfaction in their

living conditions and these cannot -

be overlooked as just another stu-
dent complaint from the many
that exist.

Results were obtained from the
"surprise" tour that was taken.
and Posvar said that he will give
the problem high priority. Funds
have been promised from the
Vice-Chancellor of Operations
Office for the improvement of the
dorms and it is the hope of'man_v
unfortunate resident students
that the administration will not
go back on its word. ‘

If such improvements do take
place then the responsibility for
keeping the Towers in good condi-
tion lies upon the students. Ef-
forts must be taken to avoid this
situation -from developing again

~ because then‘ the students _will

have no ‘one to blame but them-
selves.

The Institute of International

Education-has just published the

23rd edition of Summer Study
Abroad, its annual guide to op-
portunities for American college
students to study in foreign coun-
tries during the summer.

The new edition lists nearl_v 600

college-level programs in nearly —

60 countries around the world. It
also lists 38 programs for sec-
ondary school students. While
about three-quarters of the col-
lege-level programs are located
in Europe. every region of the
world is included.

France, the United Kingdom,
Spain, Italy, Germany, Mexico,
and Austria are the individual
countries with the greatest num-
bers of programs. But there are
also programs in many countries
where fewer Americans go: Gua-
temala, Ecuador, Ghana, Uganda,
Tunisia, Turkey, India, Malaysia,
and Korea for example. There are
programsin several countries in
Eastern Europe, as well as the
Soviet Union.

Many programs involve study
and travel in several countries.
sometimes in more than one re-
gion. e.g. Europe and the Near

 

._.;.+..  - n

East. About half the programs are
sponsored by American colleges
and universities and award U.S.
academic credit.

They are often held at. and in
some cases in association with.
foreign universities. Most of the
other programs are operated es-
pecially for foreign visitors by
foreign universities and other in-
stitutions. (In most countries
other than the United States
and Canada, universities do not
have regular summer sessions. )

Most summer-study-abroad
courses offer instruction in the
language, history, society, and
and culture of the various coun-
tries. But there are also courses
in many other areas, across a
broad spectrum that includes

such diverse subjects as architec- ‘

ture, archaeology, music, psycho-
logy, economics, physics, law,
medicine, religion, photography,
geology, education, and drama-

. tics. The booklet contains an in-

dex to these special fields.

In "duration, the programs vary
from one week to three months.

was concrete, and—non-geogra-
phically speaking—down to earth.

The purpose of next fall’s Na-

. tional Conference is to examine

. the principles and methods of
testing in three areas; education,
industry, and government, and to
propose alternatives to unsuita-
ble or unfair practices.

sessions is to eliminate minor
problems so that educators at the
conference can attend to the mat-
ters at hand.

The National Conference on
Testing is the brainchild of Dr.
Dixon. of Pitt's Department of
Higher Education and Develop-
mental Psychology. Dixon first
became concerned with the un-
fairness of testing in regard to
minority groups. notably blacks.
For instance. the question of
coachability—a technique used to
improve minority students" per-
formance on tests—has been a
controversial issue for some time.
A hopeful note was struck when
Mr. Dee Gilliam of the United
Steel Workers of America propos-
ed that the purpose of the con-
ference be to eliminate unfair-
ness to "people in general."

The main quarrel with govern-
ment and industrial testing is
that the tests don't measure what
they are designed to. An exam-

ple cited by Dr. Dixon was a test
given to prospective govern-
ment employees which asked
questions on literary topics.

Dr. William ' Holloway, Vice
Provost for Minority Affairs at
Ohio State University, explained
the problem faced by his uni-
versity. Ohio State, formerly open
to any high school graduate, is
being forced to limit its enroll-
ment. Some admissions tests
are necessary, but Dr. Holloway
is critical of their use. “We
need to set up other procedures,”
he said. '

The members of the planning
session do not intend-the confer-
ence to be all talk and no action:
discussions at the next planning
session. to be held this summer at
Racine. Wis.. will ce’nter around
means of bringing pressure to
bear on testing companies and the
institutions they serve.

As Dr. Dixon put it. "We want
to spend less time criticising and

more time acting to change."

What difference will this make
to students in the near future‘?
“That’s the students’ responsi-
bility,” challenged Dixon. “They
should get involved.”

"First. they should question
the Lise of testing for admission
purposes in Universities. If all
the fraternities and sororities
wrote theauthorities asking what
tests are being used for admission
to the Schools of Medicine. Den-
tistry. etc.. and why. it would
make a difference." Dixon said.

“Second. support the Associa-
tion of Black Psychologists‘ mor-
atorium on testing. Third. student
governments should write large-
scale testing corporations like
ETS to express a need for change.
I have more ideas. but students
are too conservative for that."
Dixon concluded. _

"When is the last time you
walked out of a final and handed
in a blank paper. because. the
testing was unfair?" I was ask-
ed.

VIVA is a national. non—poli-
tical student organization. striv-
ing for public consciousness of
our prisoners of war and men

missing in action. VIVA is de-'

manding a_ full account of our
Southeast ‘Asian forces. release of
the sick and wounded. a neutral
inspection of all prison camps.
and a free flow of mail between
prisoners and_their families.

Over 1500 Americans are POWs
or MIAs. VIVA is determined to
prevent a recurrence of the tra-
vesty in North Korea. where
389 Americans are still unac-
counted for. The Communists
have refused to discuss the fates
of these men.

VIVA bracelets contain the
name of a POW and the date‘ he
was lost. They are worn as a visi-
ble display of concern and as a
means to publicize the plight of
these men. Money from the

bracelets covers their manufac- _

turing, shipping and distribution.

VIVA is non-profit; donations
enable the production of litera-
ture. bumper stickers, pins. and
other related POW material to be
distributed free to communities
and schools throughout the na-
tion.

Besides wearing the bracelets
as a constant reminder of the
missing men. VIVA members
write regularly to Hanoi and U.S.

‘government officials on behalf
of their men. '

Colonel Edward Bollen. Com-
mander ot' the 112th Fighter Group
of the Pennsylvania Air National
Guard at Greater Pittsburgh In-
ternational Airport, introduced the
Los Angeles-based ‘organization
to Pittsburgh in December. .

1 think the‘ idea behind VIVA
is good,” said Tom Lloyd, VIVA
member_and Air National’ Guard
reservist. "People should think
about the prisoners ofwar."

“Everyone has his own war,”
Lloyd continued; “Mine was
the Korean War and I could have
been one of those 389 men. I like
to think that someone would have
remembered me.”

PITTSBURGH (AP) — The re- -

tiring dean of the University’s
School of Education says those
seeking a teaching career should
be required to study at least five
years for their certificates. -

“Demands of society on the
teacher are such that no adequate
preparation is possible in short of
five years." said Paul H. Mason-
er. who leaves his post Sept. 1
after serving since 1954.

He said the fifth year of train-
ing is needed so teachers don’t
spend their first yearlin the class-
room getting their feet wet at the
expense_of the pupils.

"Basic to being a good teach-

’ er." Masoner said. "are certain

human qualities of interest and
concern for young people and
learning how to deal effectively
with them. Degrees are less im-
portant than the development of
competencies."

‘Commenting ‘on the current sur-
plus in teachers in this country.
Masoner said : -

"I think very few people ex--

pected the surplus. We expected
it two or three years later. Itwas
the economic situation about two
years ago that brought about the
crisis." '

The Pitt baseball sqrad con-
fronts one of its toughest competi-
tors of the season tomorrow
when they face the Penn State Nit-
tany Lions in a home game at 2:30
p.m. at Trees Hall Field.

Because of the threat of rain,
the contest which was originally
scheduled to‘be played today at
1 p.m. was postponed until to-
morrow.  V

\

The two teams were also slated
to play a doubleheader, but, ac-
cording to the Lions’ coach Chuck
Medlar, the Pitt-PSU baseball
contract only called for one game

and so only a single game is:

scheduled. '

Over the past season the Pan- ‘C

thers have met with Penn State at

the end of the baseball year when .

victories against the Lions usual-
ly meant _a possible bid to the
NCAA playoffs.

Facing the traditionally strong
Nittany Lions halfway through
the season rather than at the very
end will help to relieve the “do or
die” pressure from the Panther
team.

Penn State’s Medlar is confi-
dent that his well-rounded team
will perform well. ",We should be
sound defensively, our pitching
looks strong again and we expect

to have better hitting,” he related.

Last season the Lions were se- ’

lected for the NCAA District 2

‘ play-offs for the 13th time and fin-

ished the season with a 15-6 rec-
ord. So far this year they are 10-1
(their one loss was to Lafayette).

Fine pitching‘ has figured in
heavily in the Nittany Lions‘ ex-
cellent record. Two of the hurlers
from last year’s staff, who posted
a combined ERA of 1.32, have re-
turned this spring and they are
Jim Conroy and Rick Sherkel.

Pitt’s' coach Bob Lewis holds
great respect for the pitching abil-
ity of the PSU hurlers.

“Probably their best pitcher is
the lefthander Conro'y (5-2 last
year with a 1.33‘ERA). Sopho-

' more Sherkel is also very good

(he had a 4-1 record and a 0.72
ERA last season). '

“Overall they have strong pitch-
ing. Their pitchers do a good job
in holding the opposition downt”

Penn State is also well. off in
the hitting department with the
return of two of its best hitters
of last spring.

Shortstop Gerry Micsky ham-
mered his way to the top of the
Lions’ hitting list with a .325 av-
erage as a freshman last year.

Also returning to the field is
first baseman Mark Tanner. Tan-
ner. who is the son of Chicago

The Panther pitcher whotwill
try and stop these PSU Sluggers
will probably be Mike Niccols.
According to Lewis, Niccols, 1-1.
on the year, will start the game if
his arm, which has been sore this
past week, is not bothering him.

a In playing against the Nittany
Lions, the Pitt mentor realizes
that his team can’t afford to make
many mistakes.

“Penn State has a good de-
fense,” he said. "They make very -
few mistakes. They wait for you

to make the mistakes and then‘

they jump all over you.“
Despite PSU7s all around

the Panthers’ ability to beat the
Lions.

stated Lewis. “We can win just as
well as they can."

With Dorel Watley achieving the distinction of being the fastest I

Smittie Brown's best time of 46.6), the mile relayvsquad looks like a
possible winner. Watley will be anchoring a squad composed of Rick 
Jackson, Chuck Mozingo, Rich Weaver and himself. ’ ‘

Along with their lack of depth, which" will lose them points...for. ”
the show and place positions,»the trackmen have to contend with‘ -.
fielding a void in two events, the pole vault and the javelin. ' /

“That’ll' hurt us," commented Banner. “We’re looking for a.

15 foot pole vaulter but we can’t find one. It’s foolish to spendthe‘
money on a thirteen footer. You‘ _
need to vault 16 feet just to make 
the qualifying distance at most 1',

Pitt’s hurdlers put on a show _.
at Drake last weekend and could
possibly sweep the field at the 
Big 14 meet. Rick Carosielli turn‘-i '

shuttle relays as the squad finish-

Maybe the frustration of the Pitt
basketball recruiting program is
coming to a close.

As late as last year. when Pitt
tried and failed to sign both Maur-
ice Lucas and Ricky Coleman of
Schenley. Pitt has always been in
the running for the local premier
basketball talent. but were ne-
gated in their attempts.

But this year. in the rapidly con-
cluding recruiting period. Pitt's
Buzz Ridl. Fran Webster. and Tim
Grgurich have fared rather well.

First this trio inked Tom Rich-
ards, the highly touted guard
from Moon High School. And,
while. Pitt students were strug-
gling over final examinations, the
Pitt recruiters passed some ma-
jor tests of their own.

In the last three weeks. Pitt
has signed Keith Starr. John

McBride.

Also. two or possibly three
more announcements are expect-
ed within another week.

Richards, who at six feet av-
eraged 33 points and six assists,
was sold on Pitt rather early.
Starr signed after visiting North
Carolina, and after listening to
pitches from Duke,,Kansas State,
Virginia and Duquesne.
Starr averaged 25 markers a
game to go along with his nine as-
sists.

This gave iRidl's forces two of
the top. if not the top. guards in
the state.

A third area member to sign is
Greg McBride of ‘South Hills Ca-
tholic. McBride is 6’7" and shot
50 per cent fromthe field and 79
per cent from the foul line last
year. He averaged 19 points and
12 rebounds a game for South Ca-

the Catholic Class A title game.
and a’ 19-5 record-. He also play-

. ed in the recent Roundball Class-

he was chosen MVP for the Catho-

Ridl then dipped into Clymer,
