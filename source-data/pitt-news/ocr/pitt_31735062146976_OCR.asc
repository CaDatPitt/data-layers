Druids Complete

Friday Tap Plans

Grade Requirement Rules Out

Several From Nomination

   

Druids, men’s honorary sophomore
society met in the Faculty club
rooms of the Hotel Schenley Sunday
afternoon to ballot on the 24 candi-
dates whose nominations for election
have been accepted. Those men
elected will be tapped into the or-
ganization at the activities tapping
ceremony next Friday morning.

Although several petitions were
discarded due to the fact that the
grades of the candidates did not
reach the “C” average which Druids
requires, there was a noticeable de-
cline from last year in the number of
petitions submitted. A review of the
cards in the activities ﬁle indicates
that the present freshman class has
not been very active in campus af-
fairs.

A new phase of the Druid constitu-
tion provides that the society need
not tap 12 men, as has been the cus-
tom in previous years, if it is found
that there are not 12 freshmen or ﬁrst
semester sophomores who merit elec-
tion.

Graduates, Elect Oflicers

Formation of Pitt clubs and the re-
organization of existing groups
throughout this and other states by
the General Alumni association has
gone on this year under the direction

The building up of these groups of
alumni is being pushed throughout
the state, and nine clubs representing
almost 1,000‘ alumni in Pennsylvania
have elected officers and a deﬁnite
meeting time. Several of these groups
have planned golf tournaments and
other out-door activities for this sum-
mer. Outside the state, the Pitt club

Hall Of Fame

Pitt is already noted for its
School of Medicine, football team
and even its campus hills, but now
the University holds a new honor,
dress-designing, for Frances Mc-
Laughlin, Ed35, received honor-
able mention in a recent Young
American designers’ fashion con-
test, sponsored by Marshal Field
and Company. The contest was
nation-wide and 254 colleges and
universities were represented.
The winning designs were selected
by a jury of prominent fashion
authorities.

The sketch-design submitted by
Miss lVIcLaughlin was of a sports
dress of heavy, maize-colored
silk. A scarf of pin-pleated, navy
blue silk formed the collar, and
contrasted vividly with the belt
of red cord, The style followed
the present Mexican trend.

Science Marvels

To Be Shown At
Zoology Exhibit

Demonstrations To Take Place On
Ninth Floor Of Cathedral
Tonight, Tomorrow Night

That science may be amazing in,
its workings will be proved to those!
who witness the exhibits of the special
showing of its work which the de-
partment of zoology will have tonight
and tomorrow evening, from 8 to 11
o'clock on the ninth floor of the Ca-
thedral of Learning,

Among the more interesting experi-
ments is that under the direction of}

solid at a temperature of minus 315

degrees Fahrenheit by means of liquid .

air, no life going on in its body, and
then thawed out slowly to revive and
become just another perfectly normal
live ﬁsh. Care must be taken that the

ﬁsh is carefully handled and allowed
to thaw slowly. It is then placed back ,

into water and goes merrily swimming 1'-

on.

Another exhibit of Dr. Wolf's, con-
ducted by members of the advanced
course in physiology, l.S respiratory air
analysis. A sample of a person’s ex-
haled breath is caught in a rubber
bag and the air analyzed to determine
oxygen and carbon dioxide content. If
the person has just been working
hard, he will have consumed more:
oxygen and therefore the carbon
dioxide in the sample will be greater
in amount.

An exhibit with a history
under the direction of Dr_ Collins. It
is the skeleton of an elephant. Some
time ago the skeleton was found in
the basement of the old Biology hall
by plumbers who were using that
part of the building as a workshop.
It was resurrected and moved here.
Many years ago, when a rising young
capitalist, Andrew Carnegie, purchased
and donated the skeleton to the Uni-
versity, and the contribution proved
to be the ﬁrst made by Mr. Carnegie
for any educational purpose, and the
beginning of a career of philanthropy.

A section of the spinal column of
this elephant proved to be a mere
triﬂe when laid beside one of the ver-
tebra of a whale. This vertebra, one
of about forty which the whale or-
iginally had, appears enormous to the
observer. It is a three—bladed section,
and reminds one of a propeller, al-
though its central part is much larger
in every way. To the average layman
an elephant is about the largest an-
imal he knows of. The whale, how-
ever, is much larger, the largest an-
imal ever having been known in the
world having been of the whale
species. In fact, in one of the zoology
books there is a small picture, which
is supposed to be half the size of a
mouse, and it is stated that to draw
a picture half the size of a whale
would require a page forty feet wide.

Another experiment conducted un-
der Dr. Collins’ direction is the trans-
planting into an adult animal of the
heart of a young of the same species.
The adult then continues life with
two beating hearts, one its own and
the other, grafted on, the heart of
another.

The 30 newly-elected University as-
semblymen will take their seats in
the newly-created University assem-
bly to elect ofﬁcers, appoint its execu-
tive committee, and formulate plans
for next year's legislative work. Al-
though the by-laws of the Student
Faculty association do 11ot specify
whether two-thirds majority or sim-
Dly a majority will rule in electing the
executive committee, this work will
be concluded before the end of the
year, members of the nominating
committee indicated yesterday.

The University assembly was
formed by a group of 14 students and
faculty members after criticism of
Student council, the old governing
group, came. to a climax with the be-
ginning of the current semester.
Originally appointed to investigate
the charges against council, the group
automatically took powers which en-
abled it to create the University as-
sembly. The new set-up was ap-
proved by a student referendum re-
cently.

The attacks against Student coun-
cil were hrought to a head when peti-
tions, signed by 600 students, were
brought to the attention of the ad-
ministration. One member of Beta.
Coalition, two Independents, ﬁve mem-
bers of Alpha Coalition, the dean of
men, the dean of women, and several
members of the faculty were named
to an investigating committee. It
was this committee that brought;
about the new set-up and nominated
the 54 candidates who were presented
yesterday at the polls.

It has been indicated that the new
set-up will encourage the organization.
of a Men’s Self Government Associa-
tion, similar to the VVomen’s Self Gov-
ernment Association of the University.
While these two groups deal speciﬁc-
ally with the problems of men's and
women's activities, the assembly will
be given broad powers in matters
which concern the entire school.

Festival To Aid
Activities’ Floor

Spring Dance Proﬁts To Help Buy
Sixth Floor Furniture

According to John Weber, business
manager of the University, the proﬁts
of the Spring Festival dance to be
given to the Cathedral completion
fund will be used to purchase furni-
ture for a student activities ﬂoor in
the building. Plans call for the sixth
ﬂoor for student activities. A student
committee will select the furniture.

Mr, Weber is in favor of beneﬁts
from such organizations. The Festi-
val committee is the ﬁrst student
group to give this aid to the campaign.

While the river boats do not tell
time by ‘bells, the Festival dance
‘committee, led by John Holbrook, E34,
will add a dash of “down to the seas
again” by calling dance numbers by
bells. The chief cook and bottle
washer of the crew, Holbrook, will
strike four bells, 10 o’clock to ‘youse
landlubbers,’ on Friday night to start
the ﬂatboats and pumps working
their way across the ﬂoors of Hotel
Schenley to the tunes of Duke Morris
and his orchestra of Penn State. Bell
time for Pitt lads and their belles for
the rest of the evening will be 10:30
o’clock, ﬁve bells; 11, six bells; 11:30,
seven bells; 12, eight bells; 1. one
bell;1:30, two ‘bells; 2, three bells
and then the decks of the Schenley
will be cleared.

Sports clothes or sailor outﬁts,
only, will be permitted for the ambiti-
-ous sailors and their shipmates who
will be attending the dance. No
sleeveless sweaters, open neck shirts
or jackets will be permitted to be
worn by the attendants of the dance.

Silverman On Return From Spain

ing was the ﬁi'st thing Dr. Alexander
Silverman, head of the chemistry de-
partment, heard over the radio when
he had been on American soil for
only two hours. Lowell Thomas,
speaking of the grandeur of the Ca-
thedral, conveyed the message that
Dr. Silverman, who has just returned
from a convention in Madrid,‘ Spain,
heard.

Dr. Silverman sailed March 23 to
attend the International Congress of
Chemistry, which takes place every
two years, and to which he was ap-
pointed by the National Research
council and the National Academy of
Science. There were ten delegates
from the United States,

Dr. Silverman presented a paper on
“The Causes of Opalescence in Glass.”
W'itli the aid of Henry H. Blau, who.
is doing research work with him for
his PhD., he developed for the ﬁrst
time a glass without alumina, an ox-
ide of rfuminuni. He not only ob-
tained perfect opal glasses of various
intensities, but determined, by means
of X-rays, the actual cause of color
in these opal glasses. The milky ap-
pearance is due to the Crystals of
quartzite and ﬂuorite, which form in
the glass on cooling. This paper was
presented before the Ninth Interna-
tional Congress of Pure and Applied
Chemistry on April 11. Concurrent
with this was the eleventh meeting
of the International Union of Chem-
istry_ which is purely a delegate body
sent'by various governments. Dr. Sil-
verman also sat as a member Of 3

committee of nomenclature for i1ior- in the future,”

On April 16 Dr. Silverman went to
Paris, where he presented to Pro-
fessor Henri De Chatelier, who is 84
years old and the dean of French
chemists, an honorary membership in
the American Ceramic society. Pro-
fessor De Cliatelier is France’s lead-
ing authority on glass.

VVhile in France Dr. Silverman vis-
ited the “Flea” market, on the out-
skirts of Paris, where everything from
old nails to automobile parts can be
found. There Dr. Silverman added to
famous glass collections: 3. pair of
candlestick-s from the Portieu factory,
an exquisitely thin glass bottle and
a glass mosiac lidded jewel box. Dr.
Silverman said that the jewel box is
perhaps worth forty or ﬁfty dollars,
and for which he paid as many pen-
nies. In- Paris he also procured a
Gueron glass bowl, an odd paper
weight from Baccart, and a. glass
knife. Glass cutlery is replacing metal
knives in France.

“The costs of living in Paris and
Madrid are twice as high as in Pitts-
burgh,” Dr. Silvernian stated. “Sur-
prisingly, there were no signs of rev-
olution in either country.”

Dr. Silverman visited the Univer-
sity of Madrid, which is expanding at
a terriﬁc rate. A new institute of
chemistry and physics, which will oc-
cupy four city blocks, is under con-
struction as well as an Institute of
Hygiene almost as large, This de-
velopment is supported by the Span-
ish government. “VVe may expect

Campus Sees Spring
As White Shoes
Make Debut

Overwhelming Evidences of

Spring on the Campus:

The white slices slightly dingy
from last year's dirt, which sud-
denly appear on the feet of the
would-be well-dressed males and
the spotlessly new white sport
oxfords that adorn the tiny feet
of the girls.

friend and backs her up against A
the wall in order to tell her of
last year’s romance. that .broke
up. “After we were just like that,
my dear,” she says, holding up
her right hand, the ﬁrst and sec-
ond ﬁngers of which are held
rigidly close together. _

The couples that stroll hand in
hand along the grass-lined walks
and suddenly throw back their
heads, close their eyes rapturous-
ly and exclaim, “Mmmmmm!
Smell it, dear?” as they pass a.
freshly watered stretch of lawn,

books which have every passing
day religiously crossed out and
which end abruptly on June 2.

Pitt’s great mile relay quartet " "  ‘-‘ .
missed by four-tenths of a second the
all—time Penn Relays carnival record
as they won the Class B mile relay in
the time of 3:20.8 at Philadelphia
Saturday. That Panther stars nosed
out Fordham and Michigan State run-
ners to win the event. The relay vic-
tory was the only one credited to the
Panthers in the Franklin Field meet.

Kiger, McDonald and Connelly
started off the race for Pitt and gave
Bill Keller, Pitt anchor man, a com-
fortable lead for the ﬁnal quarter-mile.
Keller coasted on to victory, staying
off one drive by the Fordham anchor
man, and ﬁnished two yards ahead of
the ﬁeld.

Saturday’s victory marked the sec-
ond straight Panther triumph in the
Class B mile-relay event. For Keller
and Kiger it was their second triumph
in the race.

Other Panther entries did not fare
so Well as the relayers. Fleming and
Jacobson took second places in their
heats in qualifying for the 100-yard
dash while Schlossberg captured a
third, but all three fell by the wayside
in the ﬁnals. Pitt ﬁnished second to
Vvest Virginia in their heat of the
half-mile‘ college relay championships,
but the times of the Panthers and
Mountaineers did not match the
times turned. in by other teams,

With that great carnival 0 their
schedule, the Panthers can now settle
down to preparing for the dual meet
with the Nittany Lions of Penn State,
set for this week-eiid. The State
trackmen boast a ﬁne array of talent
in both varsity and freshman squads,
which ought to insure a close ﬁght be-
tween them and the Pitt varsity and
frosh.

Tomorrow afternoon at the Stadium
is the time set for an appearance of
the Pitt second track team. Slippery
Rock Teachers’ college will furnish
the opposition for the seconds, whose
performances will be watched with in-
terest in this new idea at Pitt.

he way tobacco is cut has a
do with the way Chesterfield

burns and tastes

Tiers are many different ways
of cutting tobacco.

A longtime ago, it used to be
cut on what was known as a
Pease Cutter, but this darli-
ened ‘the tobacco, and it was
not uniform.

The cutters today are the
most improved, modern, up-to-
the-minute type. They cut uni-
formly, and cut in long‘ shreds.

The tobacco in Chesterfield
is cut right—you can judge for
yourself how Chesterfields burn
and how they taste.

Sociologists At Meeting

Three members of the sociology de-
partmeiit attended the annual meet-
ing of the Eastern sociological so-
-ciety last week at Harvard univer-
sity, Cambridge, Massachusetts. Dr.
Harold Phelps, professor of sociology.
secretary of the division, Dr. David
Rogers, assistant professor, and VV. A.
Lundeii, instructor, were those at-
tending the meeting. Dr. Rogers was
in charge of a seminar and Mi-_ Lun-
der was appointed to a national com-
mittee on the training for juvenile]
court delinquents.
