from formal recommendations

for treatment to suspension.

“We can send them to counsel-
ing [if they are deemed dangerous]
or we can move forward with the
judicial referral and apply sanc-

sure that the student is getting the
psychiatric help that they need. So
we will have them work with the
Counseling Center to recommend
treatment,” Walker said.

James Cox, director of the
Counseling Center, said it does

Cox said. V '
But if the student is not found
to be a danger to himself or others,
counseling is optional, he said.

Ashley Wright is one such stu-
dent. The 20—year-old senior expects
to graduate this December —— right

now.
1 Wright said she fears she "would
lose this option ifRepublicans succeed,

especially when faced with ﬁnding a ‘

full-time job in a grim market upon
graduation.

Despite concerns like Wright’s,
Republicans have already taken the
ﬁist steps toward repealing the act.
But with a Democratic majority inthe
Senateand a Democratic president,
that job will be exceedingly difﬁcult
without further Republican victories
at the polls in 2012.

Still, last week the Republican»
majority in the House passed a health
care repeal bill by avote of 245 to 189.
Thisﬁrststep forthebillhasbeen con-
sidered symbolic as Senate Majority
Leader HarryReid, the senior Senator
from Nevada,‘has not addedthe billto
the Senate’s agenda.

But two new provisions that took

effect on Sept 23 of last year directly
alfect many Pitt students. Insurance
companies must allow young adults
the opportunity to stay on their par-
ents’ insurance until age 26, and insur-
ance companies can no longer drop
coverage because of clerical errors or
because the insured got sick.

On campus, Wright said she felt
Republicans were not looking at how

House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs
also pushed during a conference call
with student journalists last Tuesday.

“I think it’s important-the kind of
message this sends to the American

people,” Gibbs said. “We are going to
put [health insurance companies] back
in charge ofmaking decisions to drop,
deny, limit and cap coverage?”

If the Republicans’ message was
intended to be symbolic, Gibbs felt it
was “of tremendous importance.”-

“I do think Republicans will pay
a political price because they are not
listening to the American people,”
Gibbs said. '

“The American people are not for
r ' g,”‘ he said, adding that one
in three young adults is currently un-

- insured and 1.3 million get coverage

through their parents. '

Another provision to take effect in
2014 will mandate that health insur-

Collaboration keyto mental

9 to 10 percent at a university,
Cox said.

“Most of the students that come
to the Counseling Center come on
their own or at the suggestion of
someone,” Cox said. “We do some
assessments and even in those it’s
up to the student if they want to
continue to get treatment. And if
they need treatment beyond what
we can provide, we can assist them
with that.”

Elizabeth Wettick, director of

the Student Health Service, said
that the Student Health Center
often collaborates with the Coun-
seling Center to get students the
appropriate medical attention and
“ensure the best outcome pos-

sible” when a mental disorder is

discovered.

Wettick said that treatment
varies depending on the severity
of the situation.

“A non-urgent student is re-
ferred to the Counseling Center. A
student who needs to see a coun-
selor in a more urgent manner is
referred to the Counseling Cen-
ter, and we will call to get them

 

ment; A student who is suicidal
is taken to Western Psychiatric
emergency room for evaluation,”
Wettick said.

Student Health also has the
ability to issue medications for
mental health issues.

“Our physicians are primary
care providers and have had
training in mental health issues,
therefore at times we will start
medications if deemed appropri-
ate.4We will only provide medica-
tions if the student is being seen
as well by either an outside mental
health provider or by the Counsel-

V ing Center,” Wettick said.

In some instances, students
suffering from mental issues de-
cide to withdraw from school to
receive the medical treatment that
they need at home.

“If a student wants to withdraw
from school, we will help them
withdraw. Then, we will require
them to meet with our Counseling
Center before they are permitted
to come back_to school,” Walker
said.

According to Cox, the most
common ailments that the Coun-

Even with the guide, those

“Students can call. Faculty

ents can call almost every day. We
get somebody that calls asking for

In emergency situations where

Students, amongfaculty and affili-

City University ofNewYork’s board of
trustees Tuesdayas it barmed tobacco
smoking on all university property —

institutions ofhigher learning, CUNY
previously would not allow people to
smoke in university-owned buildings
and vehicles. CUNY’s move followed
a nationwide trend among colleges.
According to The New York Times,

smoking or promised a ﬁuuire ban.

SOME UNCONVENTIONAL WISDOM

As collegecurtain closes,

 
   

Jacob Brown
Columnist

“Yinz aren’t from around here, are
ya?” someone asked me at a bar last
weekend.

Wrong as it may be to stereotype,
I’m used to people asking me about
my heritage upon taking notice of
my large nose or curly mop of hair
when I go withoutfor awhile without
a trip to the barber. But, like Spider-
Man facing impending peril, this
stranger —— more perceptive than
most + could somehow sense my
lack of Pittsburghiness.

Then again, it seems that most
Pittsburghers can smell sociological
differences as ifthey were blood-
hounds.

After living here for ﬁve years,
I’d felt as though I’d begun to adopt
some ofthe culture. When I go back
to visit my family in Ohio, I notice my
speech is a little more slurred than

theirs, and my pronunciation ofhard
consonants is a little softer, a little
more ’Burghy.

Heck, afew years ago, I even trans-
ferred my driver’s license to Pennsyl-
vania. For both legal and residential

purposes, Pittsburgh has become my '

home. V
Someone oncejoked snarkily that
I couldn’t write a piece without refer-
encing my native state, but I have only
done so to compare the asinine legali-

, ties of this city and state to those of its

western neighbor because it served as
a beacon of rationality for me. In all
other aspects, however, it wasn’t my
home anymore.

In moving on with my life, I didn’t
want much more to do with Ohio

' other than stopping for a few days‘

here and there to visit family.

Fast forward to two weeks ago
when I got a chance to catch up with
a good friend of mine here, another
educational pilgrim from the Buckeye
State. The topic of sensibilities across

state lines came up in conversation.

be enforced pragmatically, without
wasting tuition dollars or neglecting

' any individual’s rigl1ts?

At Pitt, no rule like CUNY’s is on
the books. Decades ago, Pitt barmed
indoor smoking in its buildings and
vehicles, and in 2007 it prohibited

smokers from lighting up less than 15 1

feet from any University entrances.
According to Vice Presidentof the
University Senate Patricia Weiss, no

one is considering a complete ban at-

Pitt. “It’s not happening right now,”
she said.‘ But considering the Wave of
collegiate bans, it might soon end up
on the radar. ‘
Before it does, The Pitt News would
like to offer afew words of caution.
For such a comprehensive ban to
generate any beneﬁt, enforcement
would be critical Given the urban na-
ture of Pitt’s main campus, a CUNY-
like policy would quickly lose its legs.
In Oakland, University buildings are
sandwiched between sprawling public
streets and commercial retailers. As

We surmised that three general
categoriesof Pennsylvanians exist
—yinzers and East Coast elitists take
to the cultural extremes and ahappy
medium ﬁlls the spaces in between.
In particular, my friend pointed out
her issues with meeting Pennsylva-

Weiss said, “Enforcing any policy like
that would be virmally impossible.”
Enforcing outdoor smoking restric-
tions inthe ﬁrst place _doesn’t hitus as
Pitt’s strong suit. Weiss said when the

, 15-foot proposal came up in 2007, the

administration made it clearthatﬁmds
and enforcement  would be
limited, with no provision made to ap-

, prehend or punish offenders. Think

about it: When have you walked by
smokers outside the Cathedral of
Learning and witnessed University
officials whipping out yardsticks?
Althoughthe CUNYban rnightfail
the pragmatism test at Pitt, it still has
merits, especially when campuses are
contained. When these conditions are
just right, a comprehensive ban can
; potentiallyhelp people quitornotstart
intheﬁrstplace. Inaciganette-barren
campus,“People aren’texposedto see-
ingsomeone smoke. So it’s not part
of daily life,” said Stephanie Land, a
tobacco researcher at the Graduate
School of Public Health. “It makes it

easy enough to qui ”

But the cause of reducing smok-
ing among Pitt students is far from
lost. The Pitt Student Health Service
offers afree—to-students smokingces—
sation program, called Q.U.I.T., which
normally lasts about sixweeks and in-

- volvesone—on-onecounseling.AsLand
stressedhowinﬂuent:ialcour1selingcan "
beinirnprovingthechancesofquitting, .

Q.U.I.T. makes Pitt stand out among

many other schools, especially since »

the program doesn’t threaten cash-
stripped students with yet another
expense. For these reasons, it makes
more sense to ﬁnther publicize this
existingprogram—why not sponsor
awareness events akin to the Talk to
Me campaign? — than to fatten Pitt’s
handbook with more unenforceable
rules. ~
Smoking shouldbe stopped, and on
college campuses, ﬁghtingitby reach-

ing out to those trying to quit might .

be more effective than attacking the
problem with invisible yardsticl<s. I

most important idea has received
relatively little play in the reactions
so far: Obama’s plan to restructure
the federal administration. Interest-
ingly enough, it is also a goal that the

‘ can achieve all by himself.

Federal regulatory code and bu-
reaucratic levels have been painted on
top of each previous round ofreform
without bothering to scrape away

' at old, chipping and useless levels.

The new layer of paint might look
very nice, but it disguises instead of

government. Indeed, even the Re-
publican response given by Rep. Paul
Ryan of Wisconsin mentioned the
phrase limited government three
times in less than 10 minutes. But
over the past 10 years, Republican
representatives and senators have
voted over and over againfor spend-
ingon defense and subsidies for large
companies that stiﬂe competition.
According to the Department of De-
fense, defense spending increased
by $200 billion over the Bush years
— and that’s not including funds for

the Iraq and Afghanistan War. It is not
small government Republicans want.

It is large government that spends — »

as some political scientists phrase
it — on guns before butter.

But Obama doesn’twant that, nor
does he want bloated spending on
social programs. He pledged to freeze
annual domestic spending, make cuts
to Medicare and Medicaid and close
tax loopholes that allow people and
corporations to shirk from —— dare
I say it — their fair share. What he
wants is a government that doesn’t
pay ﬁve people to do one job — apri-
vate company would never allow that.
He wants to stop subsidizing indus-

tries that make proﬁts off the backs ‘

of hardworking Americans and at
the expense of the environment. He
wants international trade agreements
that don’t sacriﬁce American work-
ers to the false idol of free trade. He
wants ataxcode that affords asquare
deal to all, not one that is‘ rigged to
help the few over the many.

Why? Because the waywe’ve been
going, well, I agree with our presi-
dent — it makes no sense, and it has
to stop. »

Title Town Soul & Funk Party
Shadow Lounge
Saturday
9 p.m. to 2 a.m.
21+, $5; 18+, $8
titletownpgh.com

It’s like any other Saturday night at the
Shadow Lounge -- when 9 p.m. rolls
around, the line outsidebegins to surge
inside, drinks are bought, friends are
reunited, and the D] begins to play.
Tonight, however, instead of the lat-
est Kanye West or Ke$ha single, the
playlist consists of artists like The
Yum Yurns, Spanky Wilson and Dee
Dee Sharp.

This is Title Town Soul & Funk, S

Party, a dance party held on the last
Saturday of every month that features
only soul and funk, and strictly plays
45—rpm — that’s revolutions per min-
ute — records. The ﬁrst party of 2011
will be held this Saturday.
Although the true Title Town, USA,
is Green Bay, W1s., which is appropri-
ate given the upcoming Super Bowl
matchup, the party’s name refers to an
old record of Djjason “J Malls” Moly-
neaux, released during the glory days
of Pittsburgh sports in the late 1970s
and early 1980s.

MOVIE COLUMN

Several famous films choosepto forgo familiar devices

Andy Tybout
Assistant A8'E Edi tor

Here’s something to remember as we approach
the Oscars: When it comes to cinematic inno-
vation, less is often more. ,

With the return of awards season, 2010’s
most noteworthy movies are bound to fall

under increasingly critical scrutiny, and their. p

success in using an all—too—familiar set of ele-

ments — screenplay, actors, cinematography, '

music .— will be debated into oblivion. It’s
worth noting that some of thebest ﬁlms in
history have- triumphed not because they’ve
skillfully exploited these elements but also
because they’ve ignored them. ‘ R A

ies that have attained immortality in spite of
— or because of —— the_ absence of a suppos-
edly ﬁindamental trait.

A movie with no cuts: “Russian Ark’

(2002) ' .

. Boasting 2,000 actors, a lavish, expansive
set and, most impressively, the longest single
shot in ﬁlm history, “Russian Ark” is one of the
most awe—inspiring cinematic achievements in
recent memory, “Avatar” be damned. Framed

as the ﬁrst—person wanderings of a man who A

can only be. seen by his erudite French com-
panion, T Aleksandr Sokurov’s extravagant

 

drama — ﬁlmed entirely in the State Hermit- .

age Museum in St. Petersburg —— is as much
a lesson inRussian history as it is a graceﬁil
rumination on the passage of time.

It should be noted that a less well-known
ﬁlm, “PVC-1” (2007), was also ﬁlmed in a
single take, though at 85 minutes, it clocks
in slightly shorter than “Russian Ark.” And of
course, this sort of technical athleticism isn’t
limited to the art house: For more breathtak-

in a ﬁlm composed almost entirely of still
photographs, the sight of her spreading grin
is tantamount to a climax. *
. In fact, ifythis ﬁlm abided by any sort of
convention, itwould have ended on such a
consoling image. “Lajetée,” however, regress-
es into austere stills and somber narration and
departs ona heavier, more poignant note. As
one would expect from a movie formatted like

nonexistent, and breathtaking visuals —— the
end sequence is particularly enchanting— are
omnipresent. Needless to say, it’s a refresh-
ing, if at times overly precious, break from
cinematic convention. .

For dissatisﬁed Francophiles, Sylvain W
Chomet’s “The Triplets of Belleville” — a
zany, near-conversation-less animation that
revels in the freedoms of the form — makes
for a more unorthodox feature-length coun-
terpart.

A movie with no protagonist: “M” (1931)

Perhaps the most well-known and revered
ﬁlm in this catalogue, Fritz Lang’s perfectly
paced chronicle of a serial killer, and a city’s
"attempts to bring him to justice, deprives the

. audience of what isconventionally believed to

be essential: someone to root for.

Not only are there no sympathetic char-
acters — the closest thing to a “hero” is the
scheming head of the criminal underground
—— but the movie refuses to center its atten-
tions on any one ﬁgure. The result is a de-
tached panorama of events, culminating in
a trial scene that might leave some viewers,
who previously felt no affinity for any party,
suddenly on the killer’s side. Countless ﬁlms
since “M” have tackled the ambiguities of right
and wrong, but none have done so with the
same uncompromising objectivity. If

The Shakespeare in the Parks productions are marked by their simplicity. Above, Laurel

She said the plays in Shakespeare’s time were

“Inaway, itkind of enhances theiim of every-

People of all ages read Shakespeare, including
“adorable” children who “can’t act,” Tober said.

Breight agrees with the assertion that Shake-
speare has widespread appeal.

“People of all ages love his plays and sonnets,
I think, because of Shakespeare’s sheer range 
Shakespeare inserts humor or comic relief even
into the heaviest of productions,’ ’ he said.

During the BYOB sessions, participants have
the chance to perform more obscure scenes that
haven’t been performed repetitively, Tober said.

She explained that she likesto spread awareness of
one of Shal<espear€s lesser—known_plays, “Cymbe—

character from the play, Imogen.

“It’s deﬁnitely atime forpeopleto experiment,”

WOMEN’S BASKETBALL

 

Panthers lose third

Pitt" falls at Syracuse despite 16 points from Shayla Scott

, Lauren Kirschman
Assistant Sports Editor

»l
The ‘Syracuse Orange used a 6-0
run late in the first half to turn
a one-point advantage into a
seven-point -lead, successfully,

‘ distancing themselves fromthe

Pitt women’s'basketball team. *

The _small run proved enough
for the Orange (15-4, 3-3 Big
East), as they held a lead for
the remainder of the’ game and
handed the Panthers (9-10, 1-5
Big East) a 69-60 loss at the Car-
rier Dome. It was Pitt’s third-

straight loss.

After the game, Syracuse head
coach Quentin Hillsman said he

entered the matchup with the .

goal of rebounding the basketball
well and controlling Pitt’s perfor-
mance from beyondthe arc. ‘

. ,“We wanted to make sure they
didn’t make a ton of threesvon
us,” he said. “We did a verygood
job of getting out on the shoot-
ers. We didn’t want [Shayla] Scott

and [Taneisha] Harrison to make ’

threes.” -

The Orange held Scott and
Harrison to a combined 1-11 from
beyond the arc, and the Panthers

B went 5-22 as a team from three.

Syracuse also met its goal of
winning the rebounding battle,

grabbing 44 boards, including
24 offensive, to Pitt’s 30.
'“It’s a Big East ga'me,”,Hills-

man said. “We do what we always V

do. We’re all over the glass, and

_ We’re going to rebound it.”

With 2:56 remaining in -the

. first half and the score; 28-27in
favor of Syracuse, Erica Morrow .

sank a jumper, Iasia Hemingway
followed with two free throws

' and Kayla Alexander finished the

scoringvsurge with a layup to put
the Orange up 34-27 with 1:37
remaining before the break.

The Panthers slimmedthe
lead to ﬁve before halftime,_ as
Chelsea Cole made a jumper and
Harrison sank a 3—pointer, but
the run proved enough to keep
the Panthers at bay. Pitt wouldn’t
come any closer than four points
in the second half.

Syracuse opened up a lead as
large as 13 twice in the second
half, but the Panthers kept ﬁght-
ing back, slimming the Orange
advantage to six points with just
more than two minutes remain-
ing in the game. '

But Hemingway answered
the two Scott free throws with a
layup. Then, after the Panthers
were unable to score, Harrison
-fouled Morrow. V '

Morrow sank two foul shots
to put Syracuse back up by 10,

GREGORIAN RANTS

Some of the best student

sections go unnoticed

Greg Trietley
Senior Staff Writer

 

It’s tough to talk about Pitt’s 145-12 record
at the Petersen Events Center without men-
tioning the Oakland Zoo. -

l When sports magazines publish articles
or player polls about the best student sec-
tions, the same few programs always show
up — Pitt, Duke, Kansas, Kentucky, blah
blah blah.

But there are 346 Division—I schools in
college basketball and hundreds more play-
ing at the lower levels. Some of the best
student sections lurk unnoticed, sometimes
lacking the sheer size of larger programs but
oozing with creativity and originality.

Let’s set aside the narcissism —— and the
ofl"—tempo P—I-T-T chant —— and look at some
of the best student sections you haven’t
heard about 10 times already.

Ohio

The Ohio Bobcats play in the Mid-Ameri-
can Conference. You might remember them
from their upset win over No. 3 Georgetown
in the ﬁrst round of last year’s‘ NCAA Tour?

1 - MCT Campus
The Cameron Crazies are probably the most recognizablestudent section in the country,
but some lesser-known groups are showcasing their enthusiasm and originality.

nament. Their student section goes by the
“O Zone,” which gets a B- for the name but
an A for what it does.

After certain Ohio baskets, the 0 Zone
will freeze mid—celebration and stay like
that for 30 seconds. A video on the Internet

' shows it against Bowling Green three years

ago. It’s like that “Twilight Zone” episode
with the stopwatch that halts time.

Utah State

The Aggie faithful have received the
most publicity of any school mentioned
here, but until théy’re mentioned in the
same breath as the Cameron Crazies —.— who
aren’t that crazy in comparison — more
praise is needed.

First, the student section holds 4,000
—— and 4,000 students show up. Although

» the section doesn’t have a name, it performs

the greatestvrendition of “Winning Team/
Losing Team’f in the country.

If you don’t remember it from high
school, one fan shouts out “Is that not a
scoreboard?” and everyone shouts in reply,
“Yes that is a scoreboard!” The incredu-
lous questioner learns about each team’s
score, and then the chant breaks down into

a “WINNING TEAM, LOSING TEAM” heck-
le, complete with ﬁnger-pointing. Perfect
synchronization — while yelling louder
than the PA system — makes Utah State’s
version the best. _ ‘ . -
Students also chant “I believe that we
will win!” while jumping in sync. It can’t be
beat, and neither can the Aggies — they’re
12-0 at home this year. .

Mason (High sciiciial) ‘ 

There’s something called the roller
coaster cheer that’s all the rage at the high

’ school level. Hopefully Utah State accepts

one of these high school kids so we can see it
at a college. Maybe Pitt can start this trend
at home games to make the Zoo even more
intimidating to opposing players.-

The best version I’ve seen online comes

from Mason High School in Mason, Ohio.

The Comets’ student section — the ‘‘Black
Hole” —, sits down, stomps its feet on the
ground and mimics holding onto a safety
bar. Wi_th guidance from a leader, every-

: . body shoots his or her arms up at once and '

rocks one way, then the other way, then
whichever way the imaginaryroller coaster
takes them.

Boston College
Boston College, students -are good at

razzing.the opposition. My favorite jeer
— overheard in the ﬁrst half of a win over

Providence in December -— is simple. After
every foul, and I mean every foul, a handful
’ of hooligans in the Eagles’ student section
shouts “Cheater! You’re a cheater!”
Hand-check an Eagle? You’re a cheater.
Blocking foul? What a cheater. It’s as obnox-
ious as “yo mama” jokes — which means
I love it.

4, Cincinnati I .

, The Bearcats have the most infectious
cheer in- the country -— the “Down the
Drive” cheer. It nearly allays the pain of
that 45-44 de facto Big East Champion-
ship loss two seasons ago that prevented

the football team from advancing to a BCS .

bowl game.
It’s little more than a sing-song “ohh”

' three times and a “UC!” yell, but if you heard
it when the Bearcats beat Pitt, then you
know how cool it sounds. - _

John Brown (NAIA)

This ultra—small Arkansas schoo1’s 2,000
students have the Toilet Paper Game, al-
though other programs would call it a
home-opener. When the Golden Eagles
score their ﬁrst basket. of the year, every-
body in the stands heaves rolls of toilet
paper onto the court, causing a delay that
has become a tradition._ They’ve done it
since the 1980s, and nobody in the NAIA
really minds. 3'
