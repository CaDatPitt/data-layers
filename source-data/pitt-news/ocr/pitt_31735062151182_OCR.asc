A committee, consisting of Wil-_
liam. Butter-bach,, -Col- '33: Anna-
- belle Wolfe, ' Col.- '35; Leonard
Grumlet, Col. '32; and Helen Heick,
Col. '32, representing a group of
students protesting against the re-
cnt revision of tuition rates, con-
’ ferred with University business
‘ manager John ,Weber . concerning
- their objections, Wednesday. The
matter was taken up with Mr.
Weber because of the absence from
town of Chancellor J. G. Bowman;

The committee desired informa-
tion as to whether the University
considered the tuition change to be
an. increase for individual stu-
dents; as to whether it would bring
in more revenue, ‘and itpointed out‘
that the new system tended to‘ pen-
alize the better students who de-
sired to take more work. The com-
mittee also -suggested that as a
means ‘of circumventing this, ob-
jection, provision should be made
for allowing superior. students -to
;ittend classes ‘and receive no cred-
t.

Mr. Weber, in answering the com-
mittee's queries, stated that it was
impossible to ascertain whether
the change would, work as an in-
crease»-in tuition or bring in more
revenue. On the question of pen-
alizing good students, 'Mr. Weber
considered the suggestion of the
committee to be a very good one
and said some action willbe taken
on'it. If the administration should

dents, upon application and cer-
tiﬁcation of their superior ability,
to auditcertain courses for which
they‘ are notgregistered and to re-
,ceiVe.' credit. ' '

The committee expressed them-
selves as entirely satisﬁed with an,
arrangement such as, they, suggest-
ed  if the trustees permit such
attendance at classes it is lkely
that no further action will be taken
against the revision of tuition
rates. ' ‘ ’ ’ '

who has been ‘teaching at Lingnan
University, Canton, China, plans
are being made for a .-“Pitt in
China” tag day, on the campus,
next Wednesday.‘ -

Pitt has assisted in -the support
of the Chinese University for the
past ten years and "last year was
honored by the truisteels of Ling-
nan by having Seidle selected for
a position-on thefaculty. I
_ Proceeds of the drive next Wed-

In, addition to the tagging -of
students, plans are being made for
a personal canvassing of a1~1_ mem-
bers of ,the administration and

Enginee r Inven w ‘Prop ’

 

 T. Carter, Pitt Downtowner, Constructs Propeller
Free of Disadvantages In Old Style

 

A new airplane propellor, which is expected to end the dis-
advantages of the defects of the present type, has been invented
by S. '1‘. Carter/a senior in the downtown section of the me-
chanical engineering department, and will be subjected to vari-

ous tests during the next few
made for a patent.

months. Application has been

The blade will act on a principle similar to the auto gyro.
The thrust of the propellor, one of%

the largest things to overcome in
the airplane, i-s balanced by centri-
fugal force rather than by an in-

-ternal resistance in the blade, as

at present.

Another big ad vantage is the light-
ness of weight. When the propel-
lor is of overstrength it is nine
pounds lighter than the present
type. If the tests are successful
the blade would be made to weigh
only 60 per cent of those used to-
day.

The invention was constructed by
Carter as a regularly conducted
thesis of the mechanical engineer-
ing department. The theory devel-
oped is that it will tend to elimin-
ate high frequency propellor vibra-
tion, and give an increase of effi-

jency. The hub was machined
-o~_ vn chrome vanadium steel, and
blades from duraluminum.

tests will be conducted by
me- oars of the department at the
Wright Field, Dayton, Ohio, and at
the Westinghouse Electric Com-
pany Laboratories.

Students Claim College
' Choice in Depression

By JOHN D. PAULUS

The depression would make
eighty-three of one hundred and

school, according to a Pitt Weekly-wot nursing, while others said they’d .

nine undergraduates return to
questionnaire.
Chosen at random, these stu-

dents, who do not graduate this
year, were asked: “If you were be-
ing graduated this year, consider-
ing conditions, what would you
do?” Most of the students an-
nounced that only the most dire
circumstances would prevent them
from returning for degrees. Others
stated that it would be easier to re-
turn to school than to ﬁnd a job.
Nine of the eighty-three said that
they would very probably get grad-
uate assistant posts which would
enable them to return.

Fourteen of the students ap-
proached replied that they had po-
sitions promised them already.
Eight of the fourteen announced
that conditions would be better by
the time they graduated anyhow,
but if they were graduating this
year they’d go to work at the same.
places they worked last summer.
One student announced that if he
were being graduated he would re-
turn to his uncleis farm and work
just for “board and keep” until the
depression is over.

One student, immediately after
a psychology lecture, laconically
answered, “Oh, I'd just die, I
guess.” '

Two students, one man and one
woman, announced that they would
get married. The latter stated that
several proposals are in already,
and if times don't get better by
1934 she'll take one of the boys
on his word.

Three students replied that, dis-
regarding conditions, they would
enter law school as they had plan-
ned. One student announced that
he would leave for New York and
get a job on the New York Times,

had suggested.

One woman student replied that
she would return to her old trade

return to plumbing, bricklaying,
carpentering and motor repairing.
Another said that he'd get a job
entertaining passengers on a
trans-Atlantic steamer.

Numerous other ideas were sug-
gested, among them future careers
in the marines, and homicide of all
the professors.

W. S. G. A. Postpones
Retreat Until Next Fall

   

 

W. S. G. A. Retreat, which was
scheduled at Heinz House today
and tomorrow, has been postponed
until fall, according to Rose Marie
Demestichas, Col. ’33, president of
W. S. G. A.

Several important factors have
been considered in making this
change. The Activities Training
Institute, held under the auspices
of W. S. G. A. last month lessened
the need for a retreat, in that many
of the topics -studied are also in-
cluded in the retreat program._
addition, it is believed that the work
will have more immediate interest
next fall, than it would preceding
the examination period.

The idea has not been given up
entirely, however, as Miss Helen

Robert Machesney and John
Smoyer were presented with Sigma
Delta Chi awards which are given
by the national journalistic frater-
nity to seniors of outstanding abil-
ity in the study of journalism.

Eleven honoary scholastic fra-
ternities also announced their new
members during the exercises at
which Dr. John Duncan Spaeth,
professor of English at Princeton
University, was the principal speak-
er.

Introduced by Chancellor John
G. Bowman, Dr. Spaeth spoke on
“The Happy Scholar” in which he
stressed the importance of a well-
balanced college life. He advo-
cated participation in athletics and
activities as well as a strictly
academic program to all students
who sought a well-rounded educa-
tion. -
Cyril Jacobs, Bus. Ad. '32, who
was in charge of arrangements for
the exercises, served as chairman.
He was assisted in his arrange-
ments by Dorothy Getsinger, Col.

Closes Best Season:

 

Participants In Y Activities Increased By 6,357 Over»
Last Season; 64 Conferences Held

 

The Pitt Y. M. C. A. is closing its most successful year on
the campus, according to a report of the Conimittee of Manage-
ment and the Presidents’ Cabinet. ' Nearing the close of the.
second year under the direction of W. \V. Mendenhall, the Y.
M. C. A. issued a four-page report which indicates a remarkable
increase in the number of activities, and the number of persons

taking part.

Last Panther
Out lI__’I_o_nday

“Last Gasp” Is Title of
Witty Number

The Pitt Panther will present for
its June issue due on campus Mon-
day, 23, what it chooses to call a
“Last Gasp Number.” In it will
be found the ﬁnal effort of the year
for the staff.

An inside photograph, suitable
for framing, depicting “The Age of
Sail and Steam," other picture work
that will attract favorable comment,
and the photo of the Senior Queen
and the Panther’s own choice of
Senior beauties, will be featured.

Although the staff has concen-
trated on the June issue, they also
have witty material of three
months standing, since the last twp
issues, the Exchange Number anu
the Cap and Gown Number, devoted
no great space to the local talent
in wit.

Readers will also be pleasantly
surprised by a new layout. Unu-
sual arrangment and snappy car-
toons by Vaughan Shelton, Col. '34,
Ray Coleman, Col. ’33, and Kenneth
McFarland, Eng. ’33, give the maga-
zine a new aspect, even thought it
is making its last stand of the year.
Another sparkling feature of this
issue will be a special article by
Marian Beyer and Bill Forrester.

Something different will be
brought to the readers in “A Fable
for Faculty,” a versiﬁed comment
on Pitt professors and instructors.
“The Panther Prowls” is as spright-
ly as ever and the entire magazine
is seasoned with select exchange
material. In Clothes Quarters, there
is a final article by Charlie Gold-
stein, the sartorial Winchell, as well
as the maiden effort of Elinor
Smith, Ed. ’33, who tells us things
about ladies’ clothes.

Besides Goldstein, Col. ’32, sever-
al other members of the staff make
a last stab at it in this number.
Dolores Weslager, C01,, Fannie Tal-
enﬂeld, Col., Sunny Weslager, Ed.,
Hi Howard, -Col., Merlin Chute,
Bus Ad., and Charles F: Beck, Ed,
are taking a ﬁnal bow. They tell
us that the Panther office will know
nothing more of their efforts after
May 23, when the Last Gasp Num-
ber hits the stands.

. Senior Dresses

Senior women who have or-
, dcrcd commencement dresses
from Horne’s may now obtain
them by calling for them. The
store has also ordered a few
extra ones in both styles so
that any woman who did not
order before may now pur-
chase them for $7.50.

An increase of 6,357 persons in
attendance at the meetings over
the previous year was reported.
The number of meetings exceeded
last year‘s total by 81. In addition,
13,000 persons attended 159 com-
munity contact activities such as
boys‘ club work, Helping Hand, en-
tertainment and other activities.

Sixty-four conferences and as-
semblies drew a total Of 3,249 per-
sons. The assembly for Reinhold
Neibuhr was attended by 600 per-
sons. Sherwood Eddy topped the
assembly speakers brought here by
this Y, with an attendance near
1,000. One hundred personal inter-
views in the Y office with various
Y members concerning personal
problems were held.

The outstanding single success of
the Y. M. C. A. work during t_he
past year was undoubtedly the In-
quiry Club, which was held in co-
operation with Y. W. C, A. One

thousand and twenty persons attend ‘

ed 28 meetings of the group. The
entire VVorld Education division
drew 2,183 persons to 35 meetings.

Freshman Work division shows
the largest increase of the year.
Two thousand and 46 persons at-

tender 11 meetings of the four
freshman clubs, freshman ban-
quet, and freshman camp. The

freshman camp, which was the first
of its kind held.at Pitt, was attend-
ed by 288 freshmen.

A considerable increase was not-
ed in the off.-campus services,
which included entertainment fea-
tures at the ‘Helping Hand Society,
boys’ clubs and in miners’ relief.
One hundred and ﬁfty-nine students
I001! Dart in these activities, which
reached 13,000 persons. One hun-
dred and forty-four students alone
aided entertaining at the Helping
Hand Society.

In addition 7,500 pamphlets were
distributed through the new free
distributing service inaugurated
last fall. The student Welfare
Fund campaign-raised $2,997.25.

I do not play poker,

As far as the females of the species are concerned, I
have found it easier to associate with those who are loaded
with what is commonly known as cabbage, lu-ore, gelt, dough,
mazuma, pecuniae, fish, frogs, etc. However, a lonesome
wench with a large enough automobile is also desirable. Of
course, we must make exceptions. .

As far as sports are concerned, my interest dates back to a
‘very early age. Ever since I was appointed jokes editor of the
High School Annual, I have wanted to write sports. The rea-
son~for this is easily given. It is easier to copy sports than

” jokes. .Once in the conﬁnes of this charitable institution, that
is, Pitt, I found it very easy to get interested in sports as a
whole.

When one is writing up football, it is very convenient to sit in the

Basketball, track, golf, swimming, and tennis are all right as

Then too, the association with the sports department allow-
ed me, or forced me, to become acquainted with the individuals -
that the newspapers rave about. (Not the bunch at the Sta-
dium Office.) It can easily be seen after one or two inter-
views that the athletes are not averse to a little publicity,’ the
more the better. There seems to be just one exception, and as
names should never be mentioned, the matter will be dropped.

-There's not much more, but to mention the lack of student
cooperation. By that is meant the lack‘ of mail on the sports
desk. The mail is placed on the desk as every drawer is
broken. To allow the Campus Scout to give expert opinions
on what the sport situation holds for the future, the sports
department would appreciate comments, the worst of which
will be printed. Warning is given that all anonymous mail
will be published.

In La_s_t__ Duel

N otre Dame and Duquesne
Defeated By Pitt
In ' Past Week

Captain Regis Wolff and his co-
horts will have to pull another big;
surprise this week-end it they ex-
pect to add another victory to their
list. They are traveling to Salts-
burg where they will trade shots ‘
with Captain Mercer and his Kiski
supporters in the season's ﬁnal.
To defeat Kiski is a real job in
these days of depression. Jim
Marks’ boys have not only walloped
all the high schools and prep-
schools in the district but have
been making life miserable for col-
lege teams as well. In an early
season meeting Kiski defeated the
Wolffmen by a 5 to 1 count over
the Highland Course while this en- -
gagement is on the Saltsburg Lay-
out, which just adds another diffi-
culty for the Panthers who will be
playing over an unfamiliar course
tomorrow.

Marks-Wolff Feature ,
Jiirr Marks, .]r., last year’s nation-
al interscholastic champ heads the
Kiski lineup, along with Captain
Mercer, Bob Hamilton, and Foster
Meyer. These men will be faced by
Captain Regis Wolff, Charles Wolff,
Art Sekay, and Jack Decker.

As far as the golf team is con-
cerned, last week was a banner
one. Two matches were played,
and both were won. A real sur-
prise was sprung in collegiate golf-
dom when Pitt defeated the formi-
dable Notre Dame golfers Saturday.
The South Bend players were the
favorites to win, as they boast of
one of the strongest teams‘in the
codntry but the Panthers played
steady and consistent golf which re-
turned them victors by a 4-2 count.

Irish Hampered

Notre Dame had no opportunity
of practicing over the course ‘ar-
riving at ‘the links only a short
time before starting the match, but
what really hampered them was
their inability to judge their dis-
tances on the hilly holes, being ac-
customed to a ﬂat terrain. The
Pitt players ﬂashed the best golf
they have shown this season.

To show that their victory over
Notre Dame was not a mere ﬂash
inYhe pan, the Panthers came right
back on Tuesday to repeat an early
season victory over the Duquesne
Dukes by a 5-1 margin.

These two victories give the Pan-
thers a record of tlireewins against
two defeats for this, their second
season of collegiate golf. They
need a victory over Kiski to keep
above the 500 mark and Captain
Wolﬁ and his men expect to do this
by winning on Saturday;

End Season at Kiski

' The freshman_ tennis team will
bring its season to a close Monday

Prep school squad on the Kiski
courts. ‘ _

The ﬁrst match of the season
between the little Panthers ended
in a tie. The Pitt boys have not
been displaying very good‘ form
lately, and the possibilities for their
winning Monday are none too
bright. ,

This season’s record of the
Panthers stands at only one game
,won, one game tied, and three
games lost. The lone Pitt victory
was in the ﬁrst match of the sea-
son over the Duquesne frosh. The
Pitt team also tied with Kiski and
lost to Duquesne, California Nor-

Complete Eastern Tour

Today the Panther tennis team
complete their tour of the East
when they trek out to College
Park where the University of
Maryland waits to furnish the op-
position. This match is the third
the Panthers have played in the
East and will practically close the
season for the netters.

To date, the McElroy-mentored
Pitt aggregation has but lost one
encounter. On their side of the
ledger they have two victories
over Duquesne, one over Bethany,
one over Grove City, and one over
the Plaid of Carnegie Te-ch. In all
these duels, they have lost only
two matches: one to Grove City
and one to Tech. Their record
therefore is ﬁve victories and one
defeats, and forty-one matches
won against ﬁve lost. , '

Last Monday the racqueteers
took over their arch rivals when
they defeated Carnegie Tech, 8-1.
The only Panther beaten was Cap-

Hartig of Tech 6-1, 6-3. By win-

the city collegiate championship

Twelve members of the Pitt varsity track team will take part in
their last meet for Pitt tomorrow when the Panthers face West Vir-

 

Men for almost every event will leave college dual meet competi-
tion after tomorrow. The dashes and the quarter mile will suffenirrom
the loss of Captain Len Monheim, “Woody” Harris and Jerry Vitulla.

two of the outstanding performers
of the past year and have won let-
ters for‘ three years. Len has taken
part not only in the dashes, but al-
so in the hurdles and even the
broad jump. Harris consistently
won the two dashes during the en-
tire past season.

From the half mile and mile Rob
Roy, Thiele and Gaines will leave.
Roy, who had returned to Pitt after
a layoff of three years, was expect-
ed to star for Pitt, but a bad leg
hampered him, and he was never
able to get going. Gaines has been
a steady runner and won a second
and a ﬁrst last Wednesday -against
Tech. Thiele has been a fair per-
former.

Smoyer Steady

Smoyer and Mazzei have been
running in two mile race
for so long they have become ﬁx-
tures. Both are conscientious per-
formers who have plugged. along
with ﬁne courage.

The hurdles and the jumps will
lose Marshall Lewis and Stirling.
Lewis has been a member of the
track team for three years.

In the pole vault McConnell will
graduate. Like many of the others,
‘McConnell, while never a star,
worked hard, did his best and gath-
ered in a fair quantity of points.
Jim MacMurdo is the only weight
man to graduate. “Big Jim” was
a star in high school track but re-
mained out of college competition
because of football. This year, he
began heaving the weights, steadily
regained his"old form, and now is
one of the most valuable of all the
Pitt track team members. His dis-
cus throwing and shot putting have
been sxlcellent.

Pitt has already met the West

Virginia Mo'untaineers once this
year Early in the year, the Panth-
ers traveled to Morgantown where
they took a bad lacing from the
Mountaineers in an indoor meet.

Pitt Needs Victory

The Panthers need the victory
tomorrow not only for revenge,
but also to make their seasoii’s rec-
ord look better. Thus far, the
Panthers have won only one meet
and lost three. Their chances of
winning tomorrow are fair.

West Virginia will enter the meet
tomorrow without the services of
their captain and star hurdler, Cal-
loway, who was waylaid and beaten
up at the Penn Relays. Despite
this loss the Mountaineers are still
formidable.

Fraser will run the sprints for
the visitors. Fraser is a‘ ﬂash and.
there should be some sweet battling
tomorrow when he tangles with
“Woody” Harris Pitt sprint star,~
who has been running so well late-
ly. Harris has won the two dashes
in the last three Pitt meets but he
will have to be at his best tomor-
row.

Keller Improving

Van Voorhees will handle the‘
quarter for West Virginia. Bill Kel-
ler, of Pitt, has been showing signs
of regaining form and if he contin-
ues to improve he should win both
the 440 and "the 880.

Coburn and'Zimmerman run the
mile for the Mountaineers. Here
thevwinner is really a tossup with
Jim Watkins, if he runs the mile,
likely to take the event for Pitt.

"Deevers runs the‘two”mlle race

for West Virginia and he is very
fast. He should take-' his event
without trouble. -

Bad weather handicapped fra-

ﬁnally completed their ﬂrst round
engagements Tuesday and will com-
plate the second round of play to-
day. The semi-ﬁnals and ﬁnals
vrillbe played off the early part of
next week.

Sigma Alpha Epsilon, Kappa
Sigma, and Alpha Phi Delta had
easy times in copping their ﬂrst
round games. The Sig Alphs shut
out Theta Chi, last year's cham-
pions, 17-0, and are the favorites to
cop the championship. The Kappa
Sigs trounced Lambda Chi Alpha,
17-2, and Alpha Phi Delta defeated

._ Theta Delta Psi.’ 28-7.

innings before subduing Pi Lamb-

ended.2-1 and the second 4-3.
Other games found Delta Tau

selection of umpires for these im-

Several arguments‘ have marred
games to date. Teams must re-
member that a baserunner is not
allowed to leave his base until the
ball is hit. If he violates this rule,
he is out. ’

The inﬁeld ﬂy rule does not apply
unless there are runners on ﬂrst
and second or first, second, and
third. If there is but one man on
base and the batter hits a ﬂy, he

. cannot prevent a double play if

the ﬂy is dropped by running to
ﬂrst.

 

Trackers Beat Tech,
Lose to Notre Dame

 

The Pitt trackers split even in
two meets through the week, los-
ing last Saturday to Notre Dame
and then defeatingtheir traditional
rivals, Carnegie Tech Wednesday.

The Irish administered a sound
whipping to the Panthers, the
score being 73-53. Pitt was able
to snare only four ﬁrst places as
contrasted with ten ﬂrsts for the
Ramblers.

“VVoody” Harris, Pitt ﬂash, was
the only double winner of the
meet, taking both dashes in very
good times. The other Panthers
who won ﬂrst places were John
Valenti, who copped the shotput
and “Big Jim” MacMnrdo, who
heaved the discus farther than
anyone else.

The victory for Pitt over Car-
negie Tech, 88-47, made it just
about a clean sweep in the varsity
sport competition between the
Panthers and the Tartans. The
Pitt teams have defeated Tech in

‘everything but cross country, and

that doesn't count. Page John
Smoyer and Anthony Mazzei!

The Panthers annexed nine ﬁrsts,
the Tartans gained ﬁve, and the
high jump was tied. “Woody” Har-
ris again raced to two victories in
the dashes and once again his
times Were excellent. Bill Keller
could have won the quarter and
the half, but he eased up after tak-
ing a commanding lead and pur-
posely allowed teammates to win.
Monheim took the 400, and Gaines
snatched the 880.

Valenti tossed the shotput the
farthest and MacMurdo again
pulled through with a triumph in
the discus. Jim Watkins crashed
through with a rousing win in the
mile, and Tormey copped the
javelin. Sebastian won his spe-
cialty, the broad jump and Thies-
sen tied for ﬁrst in the high jump.

Luch Latest Addition
To Pit-I: 3-Let-termen

BY SAUL WEISBERG

When Johnny Luch won a. letter
in football last autumn, he became
a memberof one of the most select
and exclusive. groups at Pitt,'the
group to which belong those Pan-
ther athletes who have gained let-
ters in more than two sports dur-
ing their college careers.

In the last thirty years, only
twenty Pitt boys have earned the
insignia for three sports; only two
have earned them for four sports.
Only one man has ever snared four
letters in a single year; eleven
others have won three.

The greatest number of letters
any man at Pitt has ever gathered
to his credit was ten. Two athletes
earned that many. Two more re-
ceived nine, and one garnered
eight. , ,

DeHart Most Versatile

According to the «records, the
most versatile man ever to attend
Pitt was Jimmy DeHart, famous

athlete of ﬁfteen years ago. DeHart W

ranks as the only person ever to
win four letters in a single year,
and he is tied with Chuck Hastings
for the record of winning the most
total letters, ten in all.

Jimmy was a star in football,
basketball, baseball, and track and
for two years earned a letter in
each of these sports. He stands
out as one of the very best of the
Panther backs onthe gridiron, be-
ing a regular for four years and be-
iig a member of the far-famed
Warner teams of 1914-15 and 16.
A dash man in track, be burned up
the cinders, while he was one of
the best baseball players this dis-
‘trictﬁver turned out. After gran-
uating Pitt, he took up coaching,
soon gained a responsible position
at Washington & Lee, later was
head football coach at Duke, and
nowhas left Duke to return to
Washington & Lee.

_ John J . “Speed” Loughran was
the other Panther to win letters
in four different sports. His "let-
ters were gained in the same sports
as those in which DeHart won his,
-but Loughran won only six all told.

Hastings Wins Ten

Chuck Hastings earned ten let-
ters while at Pitt. For three years.
he won a letter in football, basket-
ball, and baseball. In the fourth
year he took only part in football.
Hastings was a member of the
same football and baseball teams
that DeHart played on, and he
stands out today as one of the very
best of the gang which compiled
such an excellent record at Pitt in
sports in the four years before
America entered the war.

Two present Pitt varsity coaches
each won nine letters when they
went to Pitt. Dr. H. C. “Red"
Carlson and Dr. John Bain Suther-
land, coaches of the present Pitt
varsity basketball and football
teams respectively, are these two
gentlemen’s names.

Carlson played four years of
football, three years of basketball,
and two years of baseball. He was
an end for Pop Warner from 1914
to 1918 and a mighty good one,
too! He was just about as good
a basketball player as he is a
coach, and that's saying a great
deal. In baseball he was an all-
around star. Doc, has now been
transformed from one of the most
famous active athletes in the
country into one of the most
famous basketball coaches. In the
past ﬁve years, he has made the
Pitt ﬁves famed throughout the
country and has compiled a sensa-
tional record.

Sutherland Wrestler

Sutherland, or the good Doctor,
as he is -so well known, played four
years of football and track and
wrestled for one season. Jock was
an All-American selection of Walter
Camp. A giant of a man and al-
ready an experienced soccer player,

he was the kind of a man old Pop
Warner loved to handle.

Jock was no mean slouch of a-

weight man on the track team, and
in 1916 he threw the hammer for
the United States in the Olympics.
The Doctor also wrestled for Pitt
in 1916 and, although his abilities
are none too well. known, it is
rumored that he was as handy in
throwing beef as he was at throw-
ing the hammer.

Not long after he left Pitt,
Sutherland became head football
coach at Lafayette where he made
such an excellent record that when
Pop Warner left Pitt, Sutherland
was picked as his successor. The
record he has made at Pitt is well
known.

R. A. “Katy”‘Easterday snagged
eight letters while at Pitt. He
gathered in two letters in football,
and three each in basketball and
track. Katy was a sweet athlete,
who did everything well. He has
been head football coach at
aynesb-nrg.

McLaren Peabody Grad

Another All-American football
selection of Walter Camp was
George McLaren who pulled down
seven letters at Pitt. McLaren en-
tered Pitt from Peabody where he
had been an all-round athlete and
all-scholastic fullback. He became
a regular on the Panther grid
team immediately and served for
four years. He also was a regular
on the basketball team for two
years and a trackman for one.

Serving a fullback on the Pan-
ther elevens of 1915 to 1918,
McLaren’s exploits on the gridiron
have overshadowed his other work.
Experts still rank him as having
been the hardest driving runner
that Pitt has ever sent out on a
ﬁeld. He hit the line with terriﬁc
force so that something had to give
and that something was usually the
opposing line. He has been men-
tioned as being among the ﬁve
greatest fullbacks of all time.

One Panther who came very
close to winning letters in four dif-
ferent sports was Lloyd Jordan.
Jordan was a star in football, base.
ketball and baseball. He also was
a member of the track team, but
never earned a letter on the cin-
der path.

Oldtimers Recalled. --

Johnny Lindsay is an oldtimer
whose renown in the days gone by
was nothing to overlook. Lindsay
won letters in football for four suc-
cessive years. He played from 1908
to 1911 and thus he is not well
known to present day sports writ-
ers, but ask someone whose mem-
ory runs back that far. Then,
watch the words of praise ﬂow.

Another oldtimer is John Shuman
who also won four letters in foot-
ball. Shuman played even earlier
than Lindsay, but he also was a
true star. Both Lindsay and Shu-
man won three letters in a single
year.

Engineers Entertained,
Receive Awards

 

 

I‘ Pitt engineers celebrated the con-
clusion of an eventual year at the
annual smoker and stunt night, held
last Friday evening in Trees Gym.

Demonstrations of prowess in
electricity were featured by the
electrical engineers. Not content
with ﬁring revolvers without human
contact (or any other sort, to all
appearances), they produced what
is known in engineering parlance as
the “lectric eye,” an apparatus
which enables them to establish a
glow in light bulbs without the use
of wires. ’

A one-act comedy and magical
demonstration combined was the of-
fering of the mechanical engineers.

-In this feat one of the cast out the

head oil? or another member, and
then replacedit without any appar-
ent damage to his subject.

Instructor

performed with his bagpipe, and
entertained the gathering with old
Scottish arias.

A cup for the basketball cham-
pionship in the engineering league
was given to the chemists, the win.
ners. The cup was donated by W.
E. Brinker, instructor in the chem-
ical engineering department.

As a climax to the evening the
best stunt cup was presented to the
industrial engineers for a fine pro-
gram which they presented. This
cup was-given by Dean Holbrook,
of the school of engineer.

meeting of the University engineer-
ing alumnl association, to be held
this year at the Fort Pitt Hotel,
Tuesday noon, June 7. Nomina-
gtions for next year’s oﬂlcers will
be received, reports of the associa-
tion will be read, and a special pro-
gram has been arranged, under the
chairmanship of Paul Hay. C. E.
'07.

Since no general alumni associa-
tion meeting will be held this year,
the engineering association is mak-
ing a special effort for a large at-
tendance. Under the plan of the
general alumni association adopted

carry out the ﬁve-year plan at this
year’s meeting (that of arranging
special tables for graduates of
every ﬁfth graduating classes).
Classes to be so invited will in-
clude those of ’87, ’92, ’97, ’02, '07,
’12, '17, '22 and '27 in the School
of Engineering, and classes ’02, '07,
-’12, ’17, '22, '27 in the School of
Mines. ‘ .

Of the seven graduates of the
class of 1887, who have been out of
the University for 45 years, ﬁve
are expected to be present. , These
include Samuel E. Duffs, John H.
Nicholson, P. C. Patterson, Samuel
A. Taylor, a member of the Univer-
sity Board of Trustees, and John S.
Unger. The delegation for the
class of 1892 will be headed by F.
M. Cooper; 1897, C. C. Dornbush;
1902, H. I. Fullerton; 1907, J. S.
Lambie; 1912, L. W. Lambie. Other
delegations have not been an-
nounced.

The association at its meeting
this year will discuss problems
which are confronting the alumni
concerning undergraduates in the
school, and the question of
strengthening the ﬁnancial posi-
tion of the association.

Plan Picnic

Women Frglic On June 9
At South County Park

The executive committee of the
sophomore women's class of ’34, in

committee, is planning a. picnic, its
last affair for the year.
Gyla Stern, Phys. Ed. '34, is in

charge of all arrangements for the
picnic, to be held on June 9, at
South Park. Competitive games,
swimming, dancing and refresh-
ments are among the plans of the
committee.

All sophomore women may at-
tend. Assessment is seventy-ﬁve
cents. Transportation is being ar-
ranged for by the committee in
charge.

On Wednesday, May 18, the class
held the last Mother and Daughter
tea of the year. The program was
in the form of a pageant in which
all the events given by the class
were represented, Lantern Night,
the Spiderweb Party for the trans-
fers, the Colonial Dinner, Coed
Prom, the ﬁrst Mother's tea and
the Sing-Song.

A talk by Dean Amos closed the
formal program, and refreshments

Indoor Meet Features
High School Play Day

..—____._...I

The second annual High School
Play Day was held at the Univer-
sity last Saturday. Due to the
rain. the outdoor schedule had to
be dropped and the indoor
schedule was used in its place.

Thirty high schools were rep-
resented and each school sending
ten participants. Mt. Lebanon,
Perry, Dormont, Edgewood, All-
derdice, Avalon, Peabody, Garrick,
Allegheny, Langley, Oliver, Swiss-
vale, Crafton, Barnesboro, Fifth
Avenue, Munhall, South Hills,
South, Aspinwall, Ben Avon Schen-
ley Mt. Nazareth Braddock, Belle-
vue, Brentwood, Shaler, Carnegie,
Etna, and Homestead numbered
the schools that were represented.

The day was divided into two
periods, the morning period being
made up of three different ﬁelds of
activities. ,

The afternoon session consisted
of stunts. that each team had made
up during the day, and the team
portraying radio stars won in this
activity, The remainder of the
afternoon was then given over to
the continuance of the morning
program. The Jade Green team
headed by Jean Swartz won by
134 points.

 Pitt Weekly Complimented

’ HEPITT WEEKLY has been receiving many kind com-
‘ pliments for its enterprise in publishing a special edi-
tion following the Tap Day exercises, two weeks ago.

On the campus ﬁve minutes after the conclusion of the
exercises with the names of all the tappees, and special
stories and pictures of the Senior Queen and winner of the
University Award, the Weekly established a new record for

college journalism.

The promptness with which the special edition was
ready for distribution was made possible through the co- ‘

- operation of the various campus honorary organizations, to

whom the Weekly wishes publicly to extend its appre-

ciation.

if  Odd Editorial Brieis

T HE IDEA OF one tap day for‘ activity fraternities and a
'second ceremony for the strictly scholastic honoraries,

met with unqualiﬁed success.

Favored by exceptionally ﬁne weather, the outdoor tap-

ping of the activity groups, was interesting and colorful.

The digniﬁcdsetting of the auditorium that was used,

the brilliancy of the speaker, and the respect with which

the representative audience received the program, made the
,0 scholastic tapping completely impressive.

\

After all the fears and qualms experienced by the com-

inittee in arranging the events, it is particularly pleasing,

that they were so successful.

 

General approval will be expressed at the election of

» Reed Rose to head next year’s Student Council.

Rose has

been one of the most active members of the group this year,
and at times when the going was a bit difficult, accepted his
position in a spirit of ‘fairness and consideration for the
entire student body. Under his leadership, the new Council

may do big things.

 

College students often are aimless because the colleges

are aimless.

Are We Sorry ---

i As A POPULAR song of 1932 words it, “This is the end-

-ing, there’s no pretending.”

For more than sixteen

. hundred seniors and other degree applicants, the last week
in May and the ﬁrst in June witness the close of a happy
day dream. The awakening, certain to be rude, perhaps too

- 3'. rude, in times such as these, will come all too soon-

‘ It may seem unfair, after so many hundreds of us have
been extended the privileges and advantages of a college
education, to. suggest a revolution in higher educational

policies.

It will be all the more jolting when found, added

to the sentimental opening paragraph. The fact remains,
however, that a college education is accomplishing little or
no good for over seventy-ﬁve percent of those that are

awarded degrees.’

,7- _ A college «educated young man or young woman rela-
tivelygis as common today as the high school graduate of

ten years ago.

All the accusations that our institutions are

“-mills,” grinding out thousands of youths every year, are
positively true. _ The situation has existed too‘ long. People
have been going to college; not especially to obtain a better V

position, but to get one more easily.

Restrictions of «the most vigorous sort are necessary for
a quick improvement of conditions. As we suggested pre-
viously, it is probably an injustice to followers in our foot-

steps, to urge that they be deprived of the associations and
contacts which we have known. But somewhere there must
be a stopping point. Introduction of rigid entrance exam-
inations, certiﬁcation that the candidate is of the highest
physical and mental ability, and similar requirements can
,~°be- applied. Education" may then advance from its present
condition as a past art and again achieve its place at the

V fore of civilization.

Seniors Complete 2,000
Dielectric Stress Tests

More than 2,000 tests were made.
by two seniors in the electrical en-
gineering department while inves-
tigating the dielectric properties of
varnished cambric insulation when
the area under stress is varied.
This work was conducted by How-
ard Long and C. F. McClurg dur-
ing the: past semester, in prepara-
tion for their graduation theses.

This subject has been much dis-
cussed since it was ﬁrst brought
forth by F; M; ‘Farmeriu 1913. " He
stated that as the area of the in-
sulation under test is increased,
the apparent breakdown in voltage

decreases.

This theses problem was con-
ducted in cooperation with the Re-
search Laboratory of the Westing-
house Electric Company.

Industrial Engineers
Work on Senior Theses

 

Eleven members of the Industrial

‘Engineering department have-been

working the past semester on dif-
ferent projects for their senior

thesis. Various tests were made
by the students and their results
tabulated.

The subjects and those working
0 them are: “Proposed Coordin-

H. Y. Williams’ Describes  

Political Lineup

..__...__
That there is a deﬁnite need-for
‘a. new political alignment under a
third political party was stressed
by Howard Y. Williams. executive
secretary of the League for Indo-
pendent Political Action, in his
talk before the Inquiry Club,
Wednesday. Mr. Willfams' state-*
ments were made in reply to the
question, “Is a. Third Political
Party Necessary?" ’ C ' ,
“The L. I. P. A. is not a political

party," said William," “but it is
rather an attempt to concentrate
the third party movement ‘In this
country into an adequate political ~'
group.” The League will try to
include Socialists, Farmer-Labor

the existing parties, according td
the speaker. -
Mr. Williams gave a graphic ac-
count of the conditions existing un.
der our present political lineup,
and declared that these condi-
tions were caused by maldistribu-
tion of wealth, and lack of eco-
nomic planning. He stressed the

fact that the'Republican and Dem- ‘

theory, and said that to have pro-

In conclusion Mr. Williams
stated that the League for Inde-
