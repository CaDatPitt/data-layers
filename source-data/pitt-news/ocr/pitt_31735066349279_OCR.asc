MoneyTroubIesAgain

BY BILL MOORE

Deep Throat won’t be shown
Saturday, the date originally
proposed by Amateur Radio
Association (ARA) President San-

. ford Silverberg for presenting the '
’ controversial ﬁlm, but he-still plans
 bring the ﬁlm here.

“We can get the ﬁlm anytime,”
Silverberg said. “But it will
probably be well into the second
semester.” . - I

Silverberg’s insistence on pres-
enting the allegedly pornographic
ﬁlm was the subject of extensive
controversy when the ARA presi-

dent charged both the administra-' ‘

tion and members of the Student
Government Board (SGB) with
trying to stop the showing of the
ﬁlm on moral grounds.
Earlier this term,
unable to obtain

ARA was
a budget

ﬁmodiﬁcation from the SGB to cover

‘«/expenses, and attempts to meet
costs with private funds failed.
~ “As it stands now,” Silverberg
said Wednesday, “we are pursuing
cosponsorship with Franklin Pang-
born (Film Society) as a possible
help in getting past the adminis-
tration. . -

- ourselves,” Choi said,

“The booking agent has guaran-
teed us a 50-50 split, with no
guaranteed minimum,” he added.

Sam Choi, an ofﬁcer of the
Pangborn Society, ‘veriﬁed that
there was a possibility of cospon-
sorship, but‘ strongly criticized
Silverberg’s handling of the mat-
ter. -

“As a club, we don’t believe in
censorship,”-Choi explained. “But
he is out to make money, not show
a ﬁlm.” .

Choi said the Society has asked
the ARA to give proﬁts, with the
exception of $600 (the amount (of
money Silverberg ﬁrst claimed his

, group needed), to charity, for free
- showings of more ﬁlms, or for

distribution by the'SGB to other
student groups.

“We would never show the ﬁlm
“but we
would’ be willing to help out
another group trying to show it, as

glqng as some of the money goes

back to the students.”

Choi and Silverberg said no ﬁnal ,

decision has been reached on the
‘cosponsorship, mainly because of
disagreement over the money’
distribution.
' ‘ “He will just have to decide if he
wants to do it our way,” Choi said.

, BY BILL MOORE .

Lengthy debate over how to
conduct elections for ‘next year’s
Student Government Board (SGB)
dominated discussion Wednesday
at a meeting of present SGB
members. ‘

Because of an error by last year’s
Board, there is presently no SG
Judiciary Committee. Under the
constitution,’ the Judiciary Com-
mittee picks a seven-member
Elections Committee to set and
enforce election rules.

‘But this year’s Board did not
begin to correct the error until
Wednesday, and some Board
members argued there would not
be enough time to form both
committees, set up election pro-
cedures and allow candidates time
to campaign before the third week
of next term, when, according to
the constitution, elections must be
held. - 1. I '

- Originally, the Board had plan-'
ned to appoint the Elections
Committee from a list suggested by.

SGB member Chip Hubbard, but it .

was split over the possibility that,
because suggested persons were
officers of student groups, they
might not be totally impartial.
Hubbard withdrew his suggestion.

Expert Hits Atom Safeguards

BY W. JACK ROMBERG

 “if The risk ‘of some sort of nuclear

violence never can be reduced to
“zero, according to Dr. Theodore B.

Taylor. Speaking in the Learning.

Research and Development Center
yesterday., Taylor asserted that the
real question is’ how much the
possibility can be reduced.

Taylor, one of the pioneers of
nuclear explosives, stated that
nuclear violence would occur in the
forséeable future.

“I ﬁnd it very likely that across
the. next 20 to 25 years, nuclear
explosions again will be used and
will kill people,” he said. ’

Cr_ude _ nuclear explosives, . ac-

  THEODORE Woks

cording to Taylor, can be _built
relatively easily by one person. In
fact, once the necessary plutonium
is stolen, a bomb could . be
produced within a timespan rang-
ing from ﬁve minutes to 24 hours,
depending upon the purity of the
plutonium. ' ,

Another problem, Taylor said, is
that nuclear facilities already are
very widespread, with plants
existing or being built in more than
50 countries. The desire of smaller
nations to obtain nuclear weapons,
according to Taylor, results from
the larger nations’ positions that
nuclear stockpiles are necessary to
national security.

Despite this gloomy picture,

.' Taylor said the nuclear security
' situation in the United States is
= improving.

But existing security "is still not
sufficient to meet the equivalent of
past successful efforts to steal
valuable goods, he added.

The problem of nuclear security,
Taylor asserted, is-a key factor in
the. decision of whether to begin
recycling procedures to reclaim
plutonium. Some possibilities into
which Taylor personally has looked
are _the construction" of recycling
plants right next -to reactors, which
would eliminate the problems of
transportation over long distances,
and the adding of material to _the
plutonium to make it too “hot”. to
steal.

Taylor added that the govern-

‘ ment is reluctant to comment on

these problems because it‘ is not

George Packard

‘Grassroots'Campai

BY BILL MOORE

Republican "candidate for the
U.S. Senate George‘ Packard
described himself as a “non-politi-
cian,” and termed his innovative
campaign “strictly grassroots,”
while speaking before" a. small
audience Thursday [night in the
Student Union Pine Room.

Packard, former managing editor
of the Philadelphia Bulletin, spent

the last two months walking across .

Pennsylvania. “Some. people have
accused me of doing. this as a
gimmick. Well, I see it as a living
experience, one where I can learn
local issues.”

Packard, dressed in a wrinkled
work shirt and hiking boots,
stressed his non political back-
ground. “I am not owned by
anybody, there are no special
interests behind’ me, I can’t be
bought and I can’t be sold," he
said.. A ‘

He pledged tocontinue face-to'-
face__contact with his constituency if,

    

  
      

notice was.made that the Elections
Committee was being formed.
“Because of that,” he said, “there
may be some doubt whether the
whole process has been fair.”

“I think it is clear we ‘will have to 

circumvent the constitution,” SGB
member Mark Satinoff argued. “I
have no objection to extending the
elections if it means an extension of
campaigning time.”

The Board decided, however, an
unsuccessful candidate could easily
challenge the results of an election
violating the constitution.

Many Board members argued for
the elimination of the period used
by candidates to obtain signatures
on petitions allowing them to run,
because it did_ not seem there
would be enough time and because!

Pitt's Oakland Ownings 

Under Community Fire

BY NORM MARTELLO

‘Some University-owned property

; in Oakland is falling into ruin

through lack of upkeep and

renovation, according to Sandy

Phillips of People’s Oakland.
Phillips cited the case of a former

Street) thatthe University prom-
ised to renovate for use by
community organizations. The
building is presently boarded up.

Pitt obtained rights to the -A in

— property during the late 1960s and

early 1970s for building expansion
that would eliminate South Bod’-

Avenue between Forbes Avenue
and Bates Street. ‘Much of the

1970s. _ ‘ ‘,

of an education for commuters,” he
added.. “In Oakland there is no

Block-busting was the tactic used
by the University in buying
properties on street corners and in

' the middle of the block, according-
to Phillips. Holding these
properties would make it easier for
the University to obtain more land.

‘-‘How can they build a new law
building and fail . to renovate
231-233 Oakland Avenue for the
community? Anything for the
community is of second-class
quality,” Phillips said.

Assistant to the Vice Chancellor

Hlfor Public Affairs Jay Roling said
Pitt agreed to use private grants to
renovate the buildings.

Pitt also agreed to ‘fireproof
231-233 Oakland and ready it for
occupancy as long as the tenants
reimburse the University over an
18-month period, Roling said.

f‘The prime mission of the
University is teaching and re-

search. At the same timerwe shold
be a social leader in the
community," Roling said. “We
have the responsibility of being a
good neighbor.-

“If for years you have a
dictatorial administration that gave
the residents no credibility, you
can’t turn it around overnight. We
have to respect their (the commun-
ity’s) lifestyles. They have to
recognize our responsibilities.

“Physical planning is in the
process of obtaining competitive
bids for renovation,” Roling said.

Assistant Vice Chancellor of
Business and Finance Myron_
Skrabut advised of ongoing .im-
provements of University property.

The demand for housing encour-
aged speculators to divide houses
into many living units, thus
overcrowding the community and
making parking, commercial busi-
nesses and garbage pickup inade-
quate, Phillips said.

“People are sympathetic to
students’ and the University’s need‘
for housing, but there has never
been adequate joint planning.”

i>£g”é2i'—THE PITT NEWS—Friday, negating; 5i",‘137'i5 A

if I Can You Read This?  

The current cover story in one of the major newsweeklies highlights
American academia’s latest dilemma, that’ of turning out a nation of
semi-literates. , '

The story no doubt will interest and shock a good many people who

I‘ » are not involved in modem education. But for those of us on the inside,

such bad news is not news at all.

For the Pitt student who sits anonymously in lecture halls
accommodating hundreds of students, and for the Pitt professor who
lectures once a week then turns the other two hours over to his

‘assistants, the insufficiency of modern education is all too apparent.

The point has been made that by the time a student has graduated

_, from high’school, a number of factors, namely television and arnorphic

English instruction, have prevented students from attaining what was

” ~ , regarded 10 years ago as normal proﬁciency in reading and writing.

This naturally poses a formidable obstacle to learning at the college
level. V By giving more attention to remedial reading and writing
jprograms, Pitt channels rrlore resources away from areas of study at

A . higher levels.

Education’s inability to meet its responsibilities on the primary and
secondary levels also prevents higher education from achieving its

goal.

Problems on the college level serve to aggravate the situation

further. It also should be noted that a lot of these points cripple early
A education as well. T
-~.F1rst and foremost is money. It’s a sad time when classes are

overcrowded, professors are out of work, and yet tuition skyrockets. ‘
The hardship imposed on higher education by the‘ failure of '
government and corporations to allocate sufficient funds almost .

activism in the sixties.

A ’ _ appears to be a ﬁendish backlash on colleges and universities for their

In light of this, the rafﬁd increase in blue-collar jobs, paralleled by

19705, is too curious to dismiss.

- the tight market for liberal arts graduates at the beginning of the

Another perplexity on the modem campus is whether the philosophy
of education should take on a more liberal view, as in the open
classroom, or return to more disciplined structures. The confusion
surrounding this issue has been prevalent for quite a while, and yet no

answers seem to be forthcoming.

The real problem here, though, is not if one way is best, but inwhich
situation one is better. Certainly the open classroom has deﬁnite
advantages, but industrial America has" a tendency to think of

education as an assembly-line process, and imposing experimental
‘alternatives and expecting monumental results is foolhardy at best.

The chaos and preoccupation with short-terln goals (i.e. jobs) that is_
so rampant on college campuses, amid a lack of necessary funds, will
se/rveonly to perpetuate the nosedive of basic learning at all levels.

But while those who read Newsweek may be astonished at what is
not learned, we who are learning and teaching will experience no
astonishment at all. And maybe that’s the biggest problem.

Letter

J If -there is any task more thank-
less than that of a reviewer for the

"performing arts, it must be that of

the person who feels called upon to

. admonish such a reviewer, bu

what the heck. '
Let me refer you to the Pitt News.

_ review (November 19) of the Pitts-

burgh Ballet Theatre performance
last weekend in the Syria Mosque.

Your reviewer does note the essen-
tials: that the soloists were wonder-

' ful and the corps deballet less so;

that the sets were evocative, the

. lighting spotty and muddled, the
“cap pistols’ shocking and the audi-
_ encé lost a-rattling their badly writ-

ten program notes.
Good. To that, let us add that the
music was canned and dreadful,

‘ and let us pay the reader the cour--

tesy of reminding him that the Bal-
let Theatre’s,real home is Heinz

; Hall, not the Mosque, which is a

middling-to-abominable theatre for
dancing in. , I ' , _
I mention courtesy because the
spectator at any dance concert
owes himself, as well as the com-
pany, an extra bit of thoughtful-
ness. The dance, after all, is the
most difficult of the performing
artsfor the audience, because it
dissolves in its own motions and is
lost forever. Only the most alert
can hope to see it as it happens,
and in memory the dance becomes

’ almost all evanescence. This is im-

pcrtant to remember, because
memory serves up so sketchily the
materials for making judgments
and comparisons that we ought to
be a little grateful for the dancer
and his dance—for refreshing us.

v The music lover can choose to
develop his taste and skill indirect-
ly. on records, but a lover of the ’

A ‘dance needs a liv.e performance..
. 'l’his.t in can s-novbvicusly; rthat‘ ﬁtllei 

 

  C  Watcln'ngthe Dance

audience must be “live” as well,
and quite frankly I don’t think it’s a -
very lively notion your reviewer
had that Ballet Theatre gave a pro-
gram “not inspiring or beautiful,‘
but interesting.”

It helps to remember that dan-
cers never stop going to school‘
themselves—the very word used
for the daily workout is “class”—
and that dance lovers are accus-
tomedlto the pleasure of watching
performers change and develop
rather rapidly.

‘In Pittsburgh especially, this is
so. Ballet Theatre is a training
ground for young dancers who,
alas, improve to disappear. Anyone
who has- followed the company for
several seasons past will have
noted with disappointment that
Dinko Bogdanic does not appear on
this year's roster. But lo. At the
very -performance panned by the

7 Pitt News. a member of the lowly

cgrps—,—one Gregory Begley——— em-
crged suddenly (it seems) and "most
beautifully as a dancer who must
soon become a principal in this /
company. n

Then too, what a delight it is to
know that two brilliant young dan-
cers like Jordeen Ivanov and Jo

Education Takes a Beating

BY BILL KALMAN

It’s no secret that education is
not exactly the number-one priority
in America. Democratic and
Republican politicians seeto it that
huge multinational corporations
get billions of dollars through

direct‘ government subsidies and.

tax breaks, that the Pentagon gets
billions of dollars to police the
world, that the CIA and FBI get
billions of -dollars to trample on
democratic rights, and that the

. ruling rich get billions of dollars of

welfare through payments on
bonds. At the same time, these
politicians see to it that college

tuitions are raised, that special «

programs like bilingual education
are slashed, that more and more
teachers are laid off, that black
studies and women’s studies
departments are cut, and that
financial aid for students is
reduced. ‘ ‘ 
The administration of Gerald
Ford and the Democratic. “veto-
proof“ Congress tell us that open
admissions, free tuition and a7
decent education are “1uxuries"
that New York and other cities

’ cannot afford. They tell iusthat the

current ﬁnancial crisis stems from
“welfare cheatersﬂ’ students who
are getting a “free ride," and
overpaid workers- who want too
many ‘‘handouts.'' ‘

The truth is that workers and
students across the country are
being forced by America's wealthy
rulers to pick up the tab for
capitalism's economic crisis.
Indeed, New York is a test case for
the bankers and capitalist politi-
cians. 'If they can get away with
slashing social services, cutting
college budgets and chopping off
thousands of jobs in New York and
then other cities can expect the
same and worse. What is
happening in New York undoubt-
edly will happen_ in Pittsburgh in
the near future. "

This means that as’students at
Pitt, we will soon be facedwith
multiple attacks on our right to an
education.- Just last spring, we
were made to suffer a 15% tuition
hike (though in some schools the
‘hike was as high as 38%). 4 In

, response to this attack, Larry Platt,

president of. the'_ Student Govern-
ment Board initiated a letter-
writing campaign in an attempt to

 

tithe lam alarms 

inﬂuence the Pennsylvania General
Assembly's decision on Pitt’s
funding. While this campaign

- united students in an effort to ﬁght

against the tuition hike, it also
proved to be comp1etely,ineffec_-
tive.

Three area legislators, senators
Edward Early and Eugene F.
Scanlon and House member
Robert A. Geisler, criticized
students for ﬁghting the tuition
hike. Geisler said, “They (Pitt
students) didn’t,know or under-
stand the »facts of the school’s or
the state's budget.” Early has
claimed, “The legislators were well
aware of Pitt's ﬁnancial needs.”
Scanlon summed up the attitude of
tion when he said, “Students
represent just one more thorn in

the saddle when it comes to getting"

more money from: us." Sending

.letters to people like Scanlon,

Geisler and Early obviously will not
convince them to be our “friends.”
Then what can we do?

I /think that .these three legis-
lators inadvertently gave us the
answer. Scanlon said, “A
demonstration is the worst thing
for the students to do. It's effect
would be to turn us away from their
requests." Geisler called demon-
strations a display of foolishness.
To see why Scanlon and Geisler are
so afraid of demonstrations, let us
take a look at the example of New
York City students.

Students at-the City University of
New York (CUNY), which is a

federation of 20 colleges in the.
area, are used to demonstrating to ‘

improve the quality of education.
In 1969, for example, a militant
strike by students won open
admissions for all graduates of New
York City high schools.
.more than 5,000 students and
teachers demonstrated at City Hall
and successfully stopped a $17
million budget cutback and the
abolition of open admissions. And
just this month, on November 19,
more than 6,000 students and
faculty, mostly from CUNY,
marched on Washington to demand
that President Ford and Congress
provide massive federal funding to
preserve open admissions, special
educational programs and free
tuition. ' .
This demonstration was called on
November 8 by the University

 

"70 Years of Collegiate Journalism at the Urfiversity of Pittsburgh"

THE PITT NEWS is the official student newspaper at the University of Pittsburgh.

all 20 schools and was endorsed by
the National Student Association.

Also active in building this

demonstration were the Profe__~,
sional Staff Congress (the faculty 4

union), the National Student
Coalition Against Racism and the
Student Association of State
Universities, which represents
students in the New York ,State
college system. It is interesting to
note that the student governments
in the CUNY system allocated

-funds for the demonstrators rang-

ing from $1,200 to $15,000.

I was able to participate in the
march, along with four other Pitt
students. Since the march had
been called less than two weeks
before, I thought it would. be a

small affair. But I saw almost 7,000.73’
students and teachers carryin -.. .

signs and chanting slogans.
At the rally on the steps of Ehe
he
march, student leaders said that
the aim of the demonstration was
not only to defend o'pen admissions
and free tuition in New York City
but to extend these benefits to all

. students.

Also speaking at the rally were a
parade of Capitol Hill politicians,
including Henry Jackson, Morris‘
Udall, Edward Koch and Bella
Abzug. However, their “belt-
tightening" sermons didn“t sit too »
well with the demonstrators. But

the fact they put in an appearang;e_.._'g
indicates that the demonstratc‘Pe{.‘-

generated some sort of pressure.
Visible mass action——picket lines,
boycotts, speakouts and demon-
strations—puts public pressure on
legislators, boards (of trustees and
administrators. They are forced to
make concessions -they would
rather not make. And that is why
Scanlon and Geisler fear demon-
strations.

The November 19 march was but
the first step. Sam Manuel, a
coordinator of the National Student
Coalition Agaginst Racism, put it ,
this way: “This is only the
beginning. We didn't win the civil
rights legislation with the first .
march. We didn't end the war in
Vietnam with the ﬁrst march. And

we won't end the cuts with the 

march. We've ‘ got some more
marching to do, and_ there's a lot

Students must seek "out their

unions, in the black community and
amongall the primary victims of
today's economic crisis. In New

Famine in a ‘Detented’ World



Strawberry sauce forever

Bi’ MARY ANN GORSKI

Onceiupon a timethere was a
land filled with happiness and
sunshine. All the people lived in
peace and freedom, and all their
wants were met. Its name was
“Plentifulland;" -

The people's Inain food was ice
cream with strawberry sauce. they
had plenty of natural resources for
Inaking ice cream, and an
abundance of fruit for the sauces
they made. The whole world
marveled at the fruitfulness of
Plentifulland.

Now the people of Plentifulland

J;['\5/ﬂlildc other sauces for their ice

cream: there were butterscotch,
lemon and ehoeolate——but straw-
berry was everybody’s favorite,‘ so
no one ever ate the surplus sauces.
Seeing an opportunity, some
wise businessmen of Plentifulland
decided to sell the excess to their
less. plentiful neighbors. The
government of Plentifulland
thought this was a brilliant idea.
How marvelousl. Plentifulland is
sharing its wealth _ and good
fortune. and making a proﬁt at the
same time. The people cheered,
and good will was as abundant as
strawberry sauce. The wise

, government of Plentifulland, like

all governments, had to‘ give

Soon, in the name of detente, all

person. Professor Max Von
Pessimist. a learned man who
worked at the University of
Plentifulland. wasn't happy at all.
According to his calculations. at
this rate of sale there would be no
surplus sauces left in Plentifulland.

This worried him because, also
according to his calculations. the

-soil of Plentifulland was being

depleted at an alarming rate. He
predicted poor crops in-the future.

“But this could never happen in
Plentifulland." everyone cried. so
the professor was ignored and
finally even the surplus chocolate-
was gone. Detente was obtained at
'.'=‘.t.
Then tragedy struck the land of
the plentiful. The perpetually
plentiful strawberry crop.
which is made the vital strawberry
sauce, failed. The dread sour

strawberry blight ruined the entire

crop.

The people bravely ‘decided to
forgo strawberry sauce and change
to butterscotch sauce. But there
was no butterscotch. So they chose

lemon. But there was no lemon left

either. Hurriedly they turned to
chocolate. Alas, the chocolate was
gone too—all in the name of
detente.

The people began to panic.
Acting ever wisely and calmly,
their leader proclaimed: “We have
made many good friends. When
we were the land of plenty we
shared. Now fair play will make
them share their abundances with
us. '

The people then cheered forall
their good friends. -

But amessage came in unison

with »

from all their now more-plentiful
neighbors: "You can't have your
good will and eat too.”

So the ever wise and calm leader
panicked also. 1

With the lack of strawberry
sauce. niass famine set in. You
see. plain ice cream was not a
sufficient diet. Red markets soon
appeared. People killed, one
another over just a drop of straw-
berry sauce. _

Soon there were no people left in
PleIItifulland—thcy all perished
from strawberry-sauce deﬁciency.
They all died "with , the word
“detente" on their lips.

C     '  

This letter is in reply to the letter
from M. E. Elbas that appeared in
the Pitt News on November 19.

M. E. Elbas, I am a member of
the Pitt Band and I take great
offense atyour letter. However, I
will not call you ignorant because
you did sign your name. I hope
that doesn’t disappoint you.

First of all, M. E. Elbas, I can
believe that band members volun-
tarily contributed for the half-page
advertisement that appeared in the
Pitt News on November 12.
Considering, the type of coverage
that the Pitt News affords us, of
which your letter is an excellent

example, we have to toot our own
horn once in a while. It isn’t, so
much that we were better than the

Syracuse Band on November 1, but ‘

that the Syracuse Herald American
printed something about us,

I Errors on Revue/-0

I could oppose the November 3
review of the Heinz Chapel Choir

professors‘ in attendance consider-
ed it a resounding musical success
for the Choir and its new director.
But that would simply mean
assaulting one personal taste by
another. I challenge the validity of
the review on more crucial
grounds.

As in all Pitt News’ music
reviews, this one is ﬁlled with
ambiguities, contradictions and
distorted logic. Here are a few
examples of speciﬁc lines:

“The tone was ﬁne until the

tary. The Syracuse coverage was.

more than‘ we receive here in
Pittsburgh.

Secondly, M. E. Elbas, you seem
to have missed the point of the
advertisement. It was a message to
the‘ student body asking them to
come out and help us support the
team, not merely an exeercise of
. self-praise.

‘Finally, M. E. Elbas, your facts

aren’t-quite accurate. Pitt hasn’t
marched 120 musicians in quite a
number of years. We now march
over 90, and some 40 of these are
women, not girls. Maybe the
attractions of a marching band do
not discriminate according to
sexual apparatus, but according to
interest. .

-Teaching women to prevent rape
is a tremendous task, but the
Feminist Karate Union, an inde-
Oakland-based self-
defense group, is working toward
that goal. In conjunction with the
University Women’s Center,- the
Karate Union periodically offers
demonstrations and talk sessions
on campus, hoping to alert women
to rape prevention.

' “Women have been conditioned.

physically and emotionally to react

to violence in a passive manner,”

chief instructor Bobbi Snyder said
yesterday during a program in the

‘Student Union.’ “We have been

faised by a society that dictates we

_ should n'ever assert ourselves in a

manner that could be construed as
anything less than ‘ladylike.’
‘ ‘Yet, we, these ladylikewomen,

_ must venture out onto the streets of
_ ourcities and must be prepared to

cope with the realities of robbery,

’ mugging, rape and murder.

“I’m concerned with legislative

' p change in denying rape a future,

and I’m concemedwith teaching

, ~women how,_not- to be raped,”
Snyder said. '

The goal"of the Karate Union is

’ to teach women not_to appear as
potential victims and not to give

in to typical attitudes of submis-
siveness and nonaggression.
“We want to teach women to

reverse the projection of these

attitudes into nonvictim attitudes, ’ ’
Snyder said. “Rapists need vic-

- tims. The basic philosophyof our
- ‘self-defense classes is

‘Nobody
knows you’re afraid until you tell

9?!

Contrary to typical “Don’t ﬁght,

he may kill you” advice, Snyder
advises women to react angrily, ,

aggressively, and on a peer level.
“Women stand a better chance of
getting away if they do so. The
exception is when there’s a gun at
your back,” she added.

Last year, 300 victims who came
through the Rape Crisis Center, a
victim-advocacy service in Mc-
Keesport with volunteers all over
Allegheny County, almost all said
they were so afraid of being killed
that they -allowed the rape.

— Only '19-of the 300 victims were

threatened with a weapon. All the .
' rest succumbed to threats. “In the

face of that kind of threat, these
women were paralyzed by their
perception of their -own danger.
Some situations don’t necessarily
have to happen,” Snyder said.
There are many ‘myths concern-
ing rapists and those myths must

be dissolved, according to Snyder.

Most rapists are not strangers.
They might be boyfriends, neigh-
‘oors, relatives or business asso-
ciates. And most rapists are not
psychotic, she added.

Another myth is that rapists
maim, kill or mutilate their victims.
“Only one in 10,000 ever kills a
woman. A rapist rapes.” .

The Karate Union’s classes deal
with physical training that ‘teaches
the safest and most effective
self-defense maneuvers. “The

training is based on this philosophy

of the mind, ‘I don’t want to hurt
you, but I don’t want you-to hurt
me. I have a responsibility to take
care of my body,’ ” Snyder said.
“This implies a total responsibility,
emot_ionally and physically for a
woman’s own safety.

Women need to be trained
physically to work with maximum
effectiveness to deal with physical
limitations and compens_ate for

Editor’s note: This is the last in a
series examining the possibility of
holding the 1984 World’s Fair in
Pittsburgh. .

In the course of researching my
recently completed series on a
world's fair in Pittsburgh, one
thing emerged from piles of
xeroxed newspaper articles and
scribbled notes on yellow legal
pads: Pittsburgh is probably
unique among would-be world's
fair hosts. '

Most fairs are sponsored by truly
urban cities, such as New York,
Montreal and Osaka_, Japan.
Pittsburgh, though, is essentially a
collection of bedroom communities

grouped together more or less»

accidentally, it seems, and this is
part of the charm of the city.

It is also one of the problems.
Pittsburgh, set among the hills and
split by three rivers, retains .a
semblance of “rurality,” while
calling itself a city. That makesit
difﬁcult to plan any large event in
Pittsburgh, because the city layout
makes it difficult ‘to get around.

While revie'wing possible transit

systems for a world's fair, it

occured to me that Pittsburgh has
an opportunity to show the world a
new way to solve transit problems.
There are really only three ways
to move people: air, on the ground
and on the water. Air travel, as
mass transit for a. wor1d’s fair, is
technically difficult.
Ground-level travel can be
subdivided into highway travel, by
bus or automobile, and restricted-
guideway travel, such as Monorail,
Skybus or good old-fashioned
railroads. Water ‘travel can be
either above or below the surface.
In Pittsburgh, our ﬁrst choice
seems to be ground travel, but the
present road system is inadequate
to handle even normal city traffic,

 Gfi0UI9i TéaChéSWomen Railroads for City Transit?
OnPrevention ofRape A

Can you imagine trains flying out to Panther Hollow from downtown

Pittsburgh and taking to the streets of Oakland?

let alone the added crowds that"
would be drawn to a world's fair.

If highways are eliminated as a
prime mover of people,- we’re left
with restricted-guideways. Pitts-
burgh’s leaders couldn’t get
together on Skybus, and there is no
evidence to suggest the situation
will be alteredvbetween now and
1984.

But Pittsburgh has an abundance
of the senior citizen of travel———rail-
roads. The rights-of-way already
exist, and despite the relatively
poor condition of the roadbeds—
some bordering on total collapse-
the cost to repair railroads would
be far less than the sums needed to

'.buy land for _a Skybus.

This is not to suggest that
Pittsburgh should try "to shufﬂe
rapid transit needs into the hands
of railroad boards such as the'new

Conrail system. Pittsburgh already ’

has experimented with rail transit.
By refurbishing a few railroad cars

Rocks photo

and painting them bright colors,
the City has tried to foster the

‘ image of a progressive commuter V

system.

What really is needed is a new
concept: the use of railroad tracks
and rights-of-way to transport huge
numbers of patrons CHEAPLY and
EFFICIENTLY on a daily basis.

I think ,' it can _ be done in

Pittsburgh. Considering the tech-3&3“

nology available to the rubber
industry, it should be no trick to
design a rubber tire with a large
slot in the center. just the width of
a steel rail. (In Paris, ' subway

- cars have already been converted

from rail to rubber tires.) Design an
avant-garde setof cars to ride on
these slotted wheels. Put the whole
affair on a railroad track with _one
crewman, and you have a high-
speed, quiet, almost vibration-free
passenger system—one that can go
anywhere there is a track. In fact; if

them. “In our classes this involves
learning a bit about anatomy,
physiology_and kinesiology. Man
has vulnerable parts on his body,
too. He can’t protect everything at
once. But when women panic, they
freeze. It’s a question of
programming learned, conditioned
movements into the brain so they
become through practice reﬂexive
movements." T

“Women as a group are raised to
be the healers of society. Because
we have been raised like this,

, we’ve heard, ‘Don't ﬁght, don't

deal with anger. It’s not nice.’ So
we are terriﬁed to deal . with
anger,” Snyder said. “Women as

a group must realize the world‘:

doesn't stop when they are injured.
The fight shouldn't stop the minute
they feel injured. Women have to
learn to take pain. The only time
they can’t do anything is if they're
unconscious."

In case of an attack, a woman's
most effective weapons are fore-
sight and a cool head. Taught by
members of the Karate Union,
women will be taught to become
aware of their surroundings and
will . learn basic techniques of
self-defense. "

“A rape is a rape isga ‘rape. It

the proper designing is applied, the
system could be designed so that
the same cars could operate
off-track. V

A trip from downtown to Oakland
o_n-such a system would‘ take only
five minutes. Somewhere in pan-
ther Hollow, perhaps‘ near Car-
negie Institute. the cars would
leave the rails and travel by street,

on a circular pattern through the

campuses of Carnegie-Mellon and
Pitt, then return to the Hollow and
the rails and thence back .to the
downtown area.

The big advantage of such a.

system would be the cost—far less

"than that needed to design a

completely new system. In addi-
tion, during off-peak hours, the
rails could be used to handle
normal railway freight, helping to

 

restore some of the efficiency to a ' 
badly neglected railroad system. A

reached a cohesiveness of form and
shape.

Many sporadic and jarring
images revealed themselves before
the evening’s end. Sir Andrew’s
characterization was parallel to the
cowardly lion in The Wizard of Oz.

The most intriguing image of the
evening was that left by Feste, the
clown". The nature of his character
is that of a “wise fool.” He
philosophizes directly to the
audience with an aura of omni-
cience——something alongthe lines
of Cabaret’s emcee. He carries an
air of decadence. Even his tailored
visage likens to that of Joel Gray.
John Long in this role utilizes.the
beneﬁts of economical action. He
rarely wastes a glare, a smile, a
gesture. He ﬂoats through the
scenes both watching and partici-
pating with the naughty children in
their games. - i’

But most of the action didn’t

complement’ the subtlety of the

language. Shakespeare didn’t go
for the easy laugh, the cheap trick.
Yet . in the Public Theatre’s
production, their ﬂow was outra-
geous and absurd. The characters
failed to feed off of the- covert
sexuality. Sexual tension is often
the root of most comedy," but Sir
Toby and Maria were rushed
through their fun and games. —With
sexual flirtation comes withdrawal,

submission and suggestive mo-‘

ments. None of the tension
developed, lending ‘itself to
laughter.

Guffaws did reach a crescendo in
a scene with Star Trek’s Leonard
Nimoy. The steward Malvolio is
tricked into believing that his lady
Olivia is in love ‘with him. He
stumbles‘ across a letter and
miscnnstrues both the author and
its meaning. He initiates partici-
pation into deciphering the letter

comical credence. Both gestures
and movements resemble those of
a windup doll who stumbles into
walls made of words.

In recent years there has been a

Malvolio’s puritanical streak.

Ric Masten

BY LISA RUBENSTEIN

“Living art.” It’s a funny

_ phrase, and it can mean everything

from murals on buildings to
paintings on sidewalks. Poetry can
be living, too, but in some of the
ways least expected. .
Ric Masten is a living poet. Not a
“regular” poet, but one who likes
to read his poetry to a live, reacting
audience. In fact, he’d‘rather read
his poetry to an audience than have
his, audience members read. it
themselves. ’
Masten says he and his wife,
Billie, are trying to “revive an old
art form, the art of the spoken
poem." He explains that when the
printing press was invented and
the written poem became more
readily available, the art of the
spoken poem was lost.
’ Masten reads poems appropriate
to his audience. He picks poems by
feeling audience reaction——how
many smiles, closed faces or
serious stares.‘

“,1, don’t write my poems, we
do! Masten lets the audience
know that he is a real live person
standing at the front of the room.
He wants them to know he has
flesh and blood and human things
to say. _

The audience can tell. Masten
talks his poetry, and each person is
in_volvc_d in intimate conversation
with _him.

Interspersed among his poems
about suicide and lonelin_ess,
Masten relates experiences, talks
about the poems and philoso-
phizes.

“ There's nothing we can do but
grow callous. The danger comes in
being too sensitive or too calloused.
People are so sensitive they get-
over-calloused. Either that, or they
bleed to death. , '

“There is a point, though, where
YOU can be so sensitive you feel

don't die from the pain."

When Masten philosophizes, it’s
a bit hard to lean out and listen. He
seems very sincere and very open,
but at the same time he seems very
hard to believe. There’s a fear that
he may really be sincere. Masten
seems to understand himself quite
well, and the fear is that he will
know his audience too well.’ As one
of his poems says, “I know myself,
therefore I know you all.”

In fact, Masten does know his
audiences, and he knows exactly
how to ease their fear.

“It’s bullshit. I want you all to
know. Bullshit should be scattered
lightly across the ground and all
kinds of neat things will grow. You
just have to be careful not to pile it

. too high.” -

In his readings, Masten takes the
‘reader through a half anhour of
poems, and then an open-ended
discussion. The poems are what he

calls “Birth, Death and Rebirth.”

He describes birth poems as poems
that are for enjoyment, poems that
involve him and’ the audience.

' The death poems are about
loneliness, suicide and sadness.
Masten explains that a person's
closest friends are people who go

through sorrow and depression and
still remain friends. “You can’t.be
close friends with someone unless‘
you go through this experience
with them.”

Masten says the rebirth poems

are to let the audience know he is3~_,;; 

still around, and that he has things
to say.

Listening to Masten’s poetry is a
personal experience. It is a lasting
experience, and at the same time
very transitory'._Because it’s living
poetry. Even though you may really
enjoy the experience of hearing
Masten, you probably won’t
remember anything he said.

“That's what oral poetry is for,”
Masten explained. “It should be
felt rather than thought." ‘

I tries desperately to touch and hold
on to the ﬂeeting memories.
Rhodes’ performance as the
central character is flawless
throughout and reaches its peak in
the segment in which he pursues
the most recent memory, the veiled
ﬁgure of the mistress.
Rodham has managed effectively
to portray the personalities and the
relationship with each woman, and

 the audience can feel the man’s

anguish as he views these
segments of his life played on the
empty stage, ‘whose backdrop,
mappropriately enough, is the
decayed remnants of an old
theatre. _
The males in each memory

personality. In one scene, he
dances alone. Then, one by one,
each male ﬁgure joins him in the
same steps, dancing as part of the
whole. Finally, they stand in front
of him as a column. Each turns,
embraces the slightly older ﬁgure
behind him and dies, until ﬁnally
only the man as he is today

inexorable and
right.

While In Retrospect permitted
the Pennsylvania Ballet to move
the audience with a perfectly
staged drama, George Ballan-
chine’s Symphony in C lets it
display the exceptional excellence
of its dance, especially the corps de
ballet.

Symphony in C is impressive for
a number of reasons. Its strength
lies in the perfect counterpoint
echoing from the principal artists to
the demisoloists through the corps.

Moving,
somehow

_‘ The corps de ballet is more than a

moving backdrop for the soloists.

A segment of the Pennsylvania Ballet Company in». performance at

/

Heinz Hall Tuesday night.

Its dance is as exacting, and it
performs with the same precision.

Ballanchine has perfectly over-
come the limitations of the huge,
empty stage in this ballet. Through
the positioning of the dancers, he
ﬁlls the stage with a shimmering
whiteness, punctuated here and
there with bursts of motion. .

This is a classical ballet.
Nothing wildly innovative or
unexpected, but Ballanchine avoids
the pitfalls of-the classical: the
rigidity, the gaps between solos.
He has explored the limits of the’
mode, and the result is tailored to
perfection. ‘

The Pennsylvania Ballet was
signiﬁcantly less successful with its
ﬁrst presentation, Adagio Ham-
merklavier. Choreographer Hans
van Manen got the inspiration for
this ballet from listening to a
recorded interpretation of the
Adagio- from Beethoven’s Ham-
merklavier Sonata. That seems to
be the basic problem. The music

simply isn't suited to ballet. The
result is a dance so deliberate and
strained that if it isn’t actually
boring, it’s a near-miss.

Adagio Hammerklavier makes
no”’attempt at beauty. Watching
the three sets of dancers, ﬁrst in q
unison and then in several pas de
deux, is like viewing a rather
bizarre Star Trek. Each pas de
deux came across as a series of
grotesque couplings—mechanized
eroticism strained to the breaking
point. The strain was noticeab1e‘in

-both the dancers and the audience,

and it took the curtain to bring

_ relief.

Whether or not the Adagio
worked, the Pennsylvania Ballet
was - impressive _both technically
and emotionally. From the poised
skill of the dancers to the dramatics
of lighting and costumes, the
Pittsburgh audience got what it
cameifor. Something for every-
one...something good for every-
one.

— The Apple Tree. a musical, by
Jerry Bock and Sheldon Harnick,
and Masks of Angels, by Notis

T_he Apple Tree, directed by‘
Mary Bensel, which putatively
dramatizes man's original fall from

rather cloying cutsieness and
reliance upon dramatic vignettes, it
is a lot closer to You’re a Good Man
Charlie Brown (in the Garden of

, Harnick is not the kind of man to
shrink from dealing in stereotypes.
Amidst papier-mache ﬂowers and
pretty shells, Adam ‘(John Mc-

by his helpmate Eve (Alice Leech),
who insists upon doing dumb,
female things like rescuing ﬁsh
from drow‘ning and gathering

the original members of our
species. Thus we have “the ﬁrst
silly hat,_” (Eve’s naturally), “the
ﬁrst ﬁre,” “the first smooch”
and—even in this pure state—“the
ﬁrst ﬁt of pique.” ,
While all this is going on, an
unsavory-looking creature wearing
a tuxedo and far too much hair oil

of a gigantic two-dimensional apple

Vassar Clements: A

With the wave ‘of different

been a part of so many types

as Vassar Clements. Vassar, as

half Seminole Indian from
Kissimee, F|a., hastaken his

gaining recognition for his blis-
tering rendition of "Orange
Blossom Special” (which every
fiddler plays, though none as
well as Vassar) on the Nitty

"Will ..the Circle Be Unbroken”
album, he grew in demand.
The legendary Gratefull Dead
had to have him for their
”Wake of the Flood" lp, Linda
Ronstadt wanted him to tour
with her, and even the Allman

‘Brothers Band put out a cry

for his quick bow and ancient
fiddle. Not wanting to stay in
one field_ though} Vassar has
gone from good ‘ole down
home blue grass (with the likes
of Jerry Garcia, Norman Blake
and Doc Watson), to a hard
drivin sound that could only

The young Pitt Panther basket-
ball squad will face its toughest
challenge of the 1975 season this
weekend when the Hoopsters
travel crosstown to the-Civic Arena
for the annual Steel Bowl battle.
Pitt, intra-city rival Duquesne, the
University of Nevada at Las Vegas
and Syracuse University will vie for
the tourney crown.

The Panthers, coming off, a
disheartening loss to Niagara on
Tuesday, face the prospectof being
the smallest team in the tourna-
ment. First-year Head Coach Tim
Grgurich has reported that Keith
Starr, the Panthers All-American
candidate,
Friday night’s matchup with
Duquesne. Starr injured knee
ligaments in a preseasongame and

has yet to see any action in Pitt’s A
.!1-1 1975 campaign.

The Panthers will present’ a‘
running offense with which the
bigger teams may ﬁnd it difﬁcult to.

could be ready for‘

-rebounds in the Dukes’

contend. Offensively, the Hoops-
ters are led by hot-shooting Larry
Harris (20 points a game), and
guard Tom Richards (13 points a
game).

They face difﬁculty under the
boards in what Grgurich calls “our
garbage game.” Six-foot, seven-
inch center Ralph McClelland, and
6-6 Willie “the Rejector” Kelly
held their own against the taller
Niagarans until-their aggressive

'plav got them into foul trouble.

With a healthy Keith Starr in the
lineup, Pitt may give the Dukes

‘ quite a battle.

/

Duquesne coach John Cinicola
also has had to cope with his share
of injuries in this young season.
The most notable is the broken
‘ankle suffered by starting forward
Roland Jones, who won’t be back
with ‘the Dukes until January.

The Dukes are led by 6-2 guard
“Stormin’ Norman” Nixon. He
may well be the best guard on the
floor at the tournament this year.
His back court partner is sopho-
more Micky Davila, a comer who
gained some fame and -experience
playing as a freshman last year. _

What Duquesne has that the
Panthers don’t is a dominating
center. Jesse Hubbard, 6-9, pulled
down a more-than-respectable 23
opener
against Wheeling. Duquesne is 1-0
going into the tournament. ’

The game that probably will
determine the winner of the Steel
Bowl in 1975 ' will be the
Pitt-Duquesne preliminary. '

Swimming Team that World ‘War II
is over.

The Panthers are manning their
torpedoes, hoping to‘sink the rest
of the ﬁeld in the seventh Annual
Penn State University Swimming
and Diving Championships Satur-
day.

' Why is Pitt taking this invitation- r

al so seriously, you ask?_ Well, for
two‘ reasons. First, as far as

_ regional meets ‘are concerned, this

one’s a biggie. The Panthers will
be going up against some of the
toughest colleges around_-——Buck-
nell, Kent St., and La Salle to name
a few. Thistournament will show
just what we should expect from
the team this season. ' '
Second, Pitt will try to defeat
always tough Maryland, the
Wehrmacht of Eastern swimming.
since. the Championships

has taken the title, and this year
things are looking even better for
the Terps to repeat. Maryland
reportedly believes they are4bring-
ing the best team they’ve ever had
to Penn State this year. ‘

I However, that doesn’t necessai
ily wash out Pitt’s chances. The
Panthers also believe they are
bringing the best team in their
history. ‘ I

“This is the best team we've
ever had,” co_,nﬁrmed Pitt Swim-
ming Coach Dick, Bradshaw.

“We've got somuch depth in each‘

event, we'll be strong.’-’

If that’s the case, then this could
be the year for the Pitt Swimmers.
Ever since 1972, the year Pitts-
burgh began participating in the
Relay Championships, the Pan-
thers have been sneaking up on
ﬁrst place Maryland. Three years
ago they were ﬁfth, two years ago,.
third, and ﬁnally, last year,- they
ﬁnished second.

There’s only one position to
reach—and Pitt seems destined to
make it. '

Last Year, when the Panther
swimmers lost by only 38 points in
the ﬁnal standings-, Pitt won ﬁve
out of the 12 events.

“We dominated diving, the back
stroke relay, the medley relay, and
the butterfly relay,” Bradshaw said
proudly. 9

The Pantherette swimming team
takes on back-to-back competition
this weekend: ‘Princeton comes to
town on ‘Friday, and Saturday
brings in seven teams to compete
in the Second Annual
Invitational.

Princeton, the number-one team
in the East last year, is a new and
very welcome addition to Pitt’s
schedule.

“They have a very strong team,
both swimming and diving,”
Pantherette Head Coach Kate
Mathison noted. '

“We could upset them. There's
a very good chance.”

The teams will participate in 15
events: two diving, two relays and
the rest individual competition.

In the 1974 Pitt Invitational, the
Pantherettes placed ﬁrst in a ﬁeld
of four teams. This year, the
tournament will include four more
teams. Only orie of the original
four, Penn State, returns this
weekend. The other teams are
Cleveland State, Madison, Oberlin,

._ .;.—. -.—...._-..-,z..._—-;-. ~'/~  .. *' .;    ,::r§... ..:;» ‘»

Pitt

_. others.”

Of the 12 scheduled events, two

-are diving and the remainder are
swimming competitions. Awards

will be given to the ﬁrst-and
second-place teams, and for the
ﬁrst three places in individual
events. ’

“I think the strongest competi-
tion is going to come from Penn
State, Princeton and Michigan
State," Mathison said.

Michigan State has probably the
best divers in the Invitational. They
shared, with PSU, 15th place in the
Nationals last year.

A chance to observe PSU and
WVU, both of which will compete
with Pitt later in the season, should
also prove advantageous to the
Pantherettes. That's particularly
the casewith WVU, which recently
adopted a new swimming program
and hired a new coach.

"I think again our depth is going
to hurt us,” Mathison predicted.
“We’ll make a good showing, as

long as we can win a couple of’
in -the _

events and ﬁnish,’ well.

' nicknamed

Syracuse and Nevada had
exceptional seasons last year.
They were among the Top Twenty
in the preseason AP and UPI polls.

Last year, Syracuse was ranked
6th nationally after losing in the
semiﬁnals of the NCAA tourna-
ment. The Orange has lost some
key starters, most notably center
Rudy Hackett, but retains the
nucleus of a very talented squad.

Captain Cris Sease, a 6-4 forward
“Rocket Man,” will
lead the 1-1 Orange. He has
averaged 16.5 points a game in
1975. His teammate on the forward
wall is 6-5 Marty Byrnes, the
team’s‘ leading scorer and re-
bounder at 19 points agame and 14
rebounds. Coach Ray Danforth
expects a ‘lot from this year’s
squad. _ .

Nevada counters with _a little
talent of its own and with on_e of the
most successful coaches in _college
basketball—Jerry Tarkanian.
Lewis Brown, the Rebels’ 6-10

center, could provide problems for _

all contenders.
ThevRebels’ scoring punch is

produced by 6-6 forward Eddie ’

Owens, who averaged 18.4 points
per game last year as a sophomore.
His back-court counterpart. is
lightening quick, 5-11 guard Robert
‘Smith. ‘

Whatever the outcome of the '

tournament, the four teams vying
for the Steel Bowl crown should
provide the most exciting matchups
since the Panthers lost to national
champ UCLA in 1970.

This year, the team is so
strong, Bradshaw hopes to domi-
nate a lot more than those four or
ﬁve relays. As a matter of fact, he
plans on winning nine out of the 12
events, while ﬁnishing in the top
three in the others.

For all you skeptics, it can be
done. Pitt has such a powerful team
with depth galore (a 2-0 regular
season recordvs. Villanova and
Temple), that everything is within
reach .for the swimmers this
season——starting with the Relay
Championships. .

If the Panthers can clobber
Maryland with their power and
depth, then Pitt will have little
trouble torpedoing the Terps’
Lusitanian Championship plans.

Grapplers   

Travel to
Penn State

The Panther grapplers will make
their way to Mt. Nittany this
weekend for the annual Penn State
Invitational, considered by’ Head
Coach Dave Adams as one of the
toughest tournaments in the
country. I ,

‘‘There’sgno doubt about it, this
tournament has to be the roughest
in the country, excepting, of
course, the Nationals,” he said. ‘

The Panthers will "be led by

All-American‘ Rande Stottlemyer,
who is 1-0 alreadyffor the season
with a 14-4 decision over Akron
University’s Don Fickle._ '
. The Penn State,Tourney will be a
tough struggle for Adams’ young
squad. -Perhaps "the best thing
about the affair will be that all
wrestlers’, no matter how far they
go in the competition, will wrestle
at least three times.

about 45 minutes to say what has
often been said before, and what in
any case could be summed up in a
few minutes.

The script is not diverting, but
ponderous and cliched, and the
characters are boringly familiar-
an aging prostitute (Paula Swart)
and a crippled beggar (Vlado
Bendevski). both down on their

luck and flung together by
circumstance.
These two unfortunates sell

masks to a man (Edwin Gur) and a
woman (Lori Grupp). This latter
couple "persistently enters and
leaves what is rather heavy-hand-
edly named the “Tavern of Joy,”
to exchange their ~most recent
purchase in a desperate attempt to
conceal their true identities. _
From Masks of Angels, we learn
that men and women dissemble,
that they are unreliable and that
fate can be tough on a person. The

_ few dramatic techniques employed

are hackneyed and repetitive.
Under a soft blue light, the
prostitute looks passable; under a
harsh red one, she looks old and
haggard. Half a dozen ‘light
changes give the cripple consider-
ably more than ample opportunity
to__comment upon this fact. One
such observation would have been
more than enough.

Retirement in I977 it  

PITTSBURGH (AP) - Senate
Republican Leader Hugh Scott, a

_ power in Washington politics for 33

years, announced Thursday he will
retire when his current term ends
in January 1977.

- “Because there are numerous
personsqualivﬁed to succeed to the
office I will not be a candidate for
re-election to a fourth Senate term
in l976,” Scott said in a statement
issued by an aide.’

Scott's statement made no
mention of recent controversy
involving alleged contributions
from Gulf Oil Corp. _ p~

“I will say only that I have done
my level best to be an honest,
conscientious public servant con-
scious of the lawsliand abiding by
them," his statement read.

_“Only those_of you who have
shared the experience of public

service can realize the effect upon 
one's personal and family life, the ’ I 

difficulties ‘of living withinvfthe
limelight of‘full and proper_

examination of one’s entire re-I

cord, ’ ' he continued.

Scott himself did not /meet-‘with. if

said about_ his future was that he
would campaign in l976i“to/elect
