In an article that appeared in the Federal
Reserve Bulletin, Frederick J. Schroeder of
the Federal Reserve Board’s division of
Research and Statistics said that in April of
1983 the board established that, of the
households in the United _States with check-
ing, savings, NOW or share draft accounts,
more than 68 percent had an account with an
automatic teller feature. This is up 54 per-
cent from 1981. Glamour magazine reported
that there are approximately 55,000 banking
machines in use today. _

Students with hectic schedules, classes,
part—time jobs, study time, social and extra-
curricular activities would rather not take
that half hour to stand in line and deal with a
teller. A banking card gives them freedom to
take cash out of an account in only a matter
of minutes. “As individuals, consumers like
to serve themselves,” says Schroeder.

“I prefer the ATM to a human teller
because it’s fast,” said a Pitt staff member. “I
know how much money 1 have in my
account. 1 don’t have to deal with checks. .

“This explains the growth and’popularity
of ATM’s at universities such as Pitt. area

Mass media program

given green light

By Michele Rhodes
The Pitt News

A proposal for a mass media con-
centration in the department of
communication was approved
unanimously by the College of Arts
and Sciences Council (CASC)
yesterday.

According to the proposal sub-
mitted by Pitt communication chair-
man Thomas Kane, the concentra-
tion would equip majors with the
critical tools necessary to evaluate
the nature of mass communication
and its effects on society and culture.

Emphasis, Kane said, would be
placed on studying mass media in an
academic setting with a clearly
defined liberal arts orientation as
opposed to a technical production
orientation.

“We are not going to train people
to run television stations,” Kane
said.

CAS Dean lrwin Schulman
expressed concern that the program
maintain an academic character. “It
should be done in such a way as to be
consonant with the principles and
values of the College of Arts and

LCB officials said that the board voted 2-1 to go along with a

Sciericesff Schulman said. “We do
not want a ‘media tech‘ approach."

Support for such a program has
been growing, according to Schul-
man. “We are being nudged by
higher administration to move in
this direction,” Schulman said. He
admitted that considerable student
demand already exists in the com-
munication department for a spe-
cialization of study in this
fast-growing field. _ A

Four new courses suggested ﬂ
part of the mass media concentra-
tion were presented in the proposal.
The council approved all course
offerings with the provision that
clear distinction be made between
proposed courses and already exist-
ing ones. The proposal now faces a
vote in the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences Council.

Courses would include media crit-
icism, history of the mass media,
introduction to mass media research
and children and the media. ,

The course in research, according

to the proposal, would introduceﬂ

mass media majors to methods and
designs used by mass media
researchers. Children and the media
proposes to study how children use
the media and how it affects them.

Pitt’s infant-family program
gets mental health award

By Dan Bates
The Pitt News

Pitt‘s Infant-Family Resource
Program recently received the
National Mental Health Associa-
tion’s 1983 Lela Rowland Preven-
tion. Award. The award was
established by Dr. Lloyd Rowland,
former exective director ofthe Loui-
siana State Mental Health Associa-
tion, in an effort to recognize model
prevention programs for their inno-
vation and influence on other fields
and strong research and evaluation.

Dr. Elise Broussard, the director
of the program, accepted the award
on Jan. 19 before the meeting of the
board of directors of United Mental
Health Inc.

Broussard, after serving 10 years
as assistant county health officer in
Pensicola, Fla.-, came to Pittsburgh
and took on the positions of profes-
sor of public health psychiatry in the
of health services
administration at Pitt’s Graduate
School of Public Health and profes-
sor of psychiatry at the School of
Medicine.

The Infant-Family Resource Pro-
gram began in V1963 as a study of
normal and healthy first-born

Broussard. “l have a long-term
interest in improving the quality of
life in future generations,” Brous-
sard said.

With the cooperation of five local
hospitals and the parents of 318
first-born infants, the program
focused on infant and parental
development. However, it soon

evolved into alongitudinal study of s 

the infants and their parents over a
period of 19 years.

The study revealed that the par-
ents exhibited signs of anxiety, lack

‘of confidence and lack of family sup-

port systems. “These parents are less
able to have pride and pleasure in
parenthood,” Broussard said, “and
it is very important that parents get
pleasure out of raising their
children.”

In 1973, the program shifted its
focus from solid research to a
service-oriented program aimed at

. quality of life in future generations.’

helping parents develop pride and 2

pleasure in parenting. An outreach
program was then instituted to help
problem parents to develop the
necessary skills to raise their chil-
dren effectively.

With financial aid irom lOCal
foundations, private contributions
.and government funding, the pro-
gram has been sucessfully running
for 11 years.

The program also focuses on edu-
cating others enteringhealth-related
fields.‘ It offers a training program

Broussard expects the future of
the program to be fruitful. “We hope
to receive funding to study, in depth,
the life course of the mothers in the
1963 study,” Broussard said. “If it
weren’t for the dedication and com-
mitment of the parents, we would
not have learned so much about how

develop along with them.”

Auto no-fault could cost motorists

more

According to state Sen. James A. Romanelli, a bill repealing
Pen nsylvania’s 10-year-old auto no-fault law could cost motor-
ists more than the present system does today. The no-fault
repeal. which passed the Senate last week and is on its way to
the governor, has been praised by advocates as the answer to
Pennsylvania‘s soaring auto insurance premiums.

Romanelli and l4 other senators voted against the measure
because they were not convinced that the new system will be
any better. Under the present bill, motorists would only be
required to purchase a minimum of $5,000 medical insurance
for thernselves. Romanelli voiced concern that this system
benefits those who do not want to buy insurance or would buy
less coverage than they need.

Senate leaders have already indicated that they are working
onta second legislative proposal to correct objections Gov.
Thornburgh has expresses to the bill.

  Common Goal

February is National Black History month. Instead of being
a time for only the black communitytto learn about and reflect
upon the contributions that blacks have made to American
culture, it should be a time for all Americans to take pride in the
achievements of their countrymen.

Too often, though, individuals who are not members of the
celebrated group feel inhibited by the singularity of the occa-,
sion and fail to share in this learning experience. The well-
intentioned celebration somehow alienates other groups. It is
the lack of information exchange that furthers racism and

prejudice on all sides.

Black history as ‘well as native American history should be
integral parts of any education — college, high schooltand
elementary. Very few universities have a native American stud-
ies program, and Pitt only offers one course on the subject.
The only reason Pitt even offers this course is because of the
efforts of an impasssioned professor. The course has been
scheduled ‘to be offered for the last time this spring.

The black studiesprogram does well in its advancement of
black issues, and so do the Jewish and the women’s studies

programs for their groups. However, the design of these pro-

grams should not just seek to educate the members of a select
few. The programs should serve a broader‘and more valuable
purpose: to break down the information and social barriers
that necessitated the establishment of the programs in the first.
place.

iOf course, instructors in these disciplines will be quick to

, point out that there is nothing barring anyone from taking any

of their courses. This argument would serve only to ignore the

' intimidation element.

Prejudice, whether aimed at blacks, Indians, Jews, women or

any group, has no place in our society. Commemorative ‘

months and anniversaries may be anexcellent way to highlight

‘ the achievements of any one group, but all efforts should be
I made to actively recruit and educate the whole of society.

I   Good Work

Pitt's School of Social Work recently was rated as having the
eighth-best graduate program in social work-social welfare in
the nation and the highest among the five graduate programs in
the state. ' I ’

The rating comes at a time when the priority lists of both
government and academia seldom include anything as arcane
as social work. The Reagan Administration has taken to trim-
ming social programs to the point where people are left to
battle their financial, marital or pyschological problems alone.

In these money-scarce days, people need the “services and
people of social work more than ever. \

I We hope that this showing by Pitt's School of Social Work
will remind the community and the university administration
of the importance of this field of study.

Faculty and students who have chosen to study the needs of
others have often been rewarded with slashed budgets and
decreasingjob possibilities. The good marks of Pitt's School of
Social work reveals a dedication which deserves a higher
priority. v

Current enrollment in the school stands at 654 degree-

ii candidate students. Enrollment has increased over 50 percent
‘A in the last decade. Clearly, that increase can be attributed to the

quality‘ of Pitts program. j .
As the university thinks about its future; we hope it
remembers those numbers. The lure of the “campus of the
future" and other relationships with the world of high-tech
should never cloud our vision. Social work and other low-
profile fields of study remain as vital and important a part of
our future, both as an institution oflearningand as a society. as

Trickle-down U. I

I noticed that in two consecutive
weeks The Pitt News had front-page
stories describing how the Honors
Program is iprospering and how
minority enrollment is declining.
You don‘t think there’s a connec-

tion operating, do you‘? Naw. Just a
coincidence.

Moral litigation

In her ‘column in.the Monday,
Jan. 30, issue of the Pitt News, Vicki
Zeitner puts forth the view that,
“Morality cannot be legislated, espe-
cially in a democratic, pluralist
society such as ours.”

When, in the history of mankind,
hasn't a government _ legislated
morality? ‘

One of the fundamental responsi-
bilities of any society is to legislate
morality. Law deals with moral and
ethical issues. When a government
enacts and enforces a law, it is mak- .

I ing a decision on a moral issue: steal-

ing is wrong. Embezzlement is
wrong. Perjury is wrong. Murder is

wrong. What are these, if not moral .

judgments.‘ .

In any society, a conflict inevita-
bly arises between the benefit of the
society as a whole and the freedom
of its individual members. In form-
ing societies, people sacrifice a cer-
tain degree of personal liberty
(hopefully a minimal amount) in
order to cooperate as a groupto

' benefit the common good. In this

process I, as an individual, agree to
be governed by a legislative body but
expect to benefit from being a

.iThe

member of the larger community
which forms the society. I may not
murder at will, since such behavior is
extremely detrimental to the whole
of society. An aspect of.my morality
has thus been controlled. In addi-
tion, it is not simply a question of
punishment for unacceptable behav-

ior. We, as a society, make value-

judgments on actions: murder is
wrong. A .
Society does, then, legislate moral
issues and makes this the realm of
the “law.” But when might this be
detrimental? In a “democratic, plu-
ralist society such as ours,” it would
probably be agreed that a specific
religious morality should not neces-
sarily be legislated. However, it is
crucial to make "a distinction
between the morality that a society
adopts as its code of law and the

. morality that a religion accepts as a

code of conduct.
two forms of morality
obviously overlap; many religions
regard stealing, murder, and lying;
as wrong. To label these as “moral
religious issues” that should not be
legislated by government is non-
sense. It is up to society to decide
what morals are in the realm of state
and to legislate accordingly.

Preface established, I now come
to the question of the morality of

‘ abortion. Abortion is not, as some

would claim, a strictly religious
issue, to be likened to the question of
eating meat on Friday. It is a societal
question. It is as much a matter of
law as questions in medical ehtics or
the morality of war, for these too are
issues with widely disparate points
of view and no clear-cut solutions.
There are questions about abortion
that must be answered: Is the fetus a
human being? What rights does the
developing child have? What rights
does the mother have? These ques-

tions may already have- been given P

answers by religions, but that is
immaterial to the fact that we,.as a
society, must answer them for our
society. _

The issue of abortion cannot be
regarded as a personal decision to be
made only by the individual. Alco-

hol prohibition tried to regulate
individual behavior, and was
regarded by many as a mistake. The
enactment of laws against drunk
driving, however, is an entirely dif-
ferent matter. a person does not
have the right to endanger other
lives as a result of his choice. Like-‘
wise, if a human life is threatened by
abortion, the issue is not and cannot
be one to be decided solely by the
individual. It becomes a concern of
society as a whole, and it is then a
question of law. _ ' '
We have now reached a point in
historywhen, members of a demo-
cratic, pluralist society disagree on
the answers to the questions posed
by abortion. Slavery was at one time
regarded by the majority as a mor-
ally correct institution until those
views were critically examined and a
societal decision was made. For the
majority to now sweep aside the
issue of abortion as being a question
of religious morality is an evasion of
the challenges that we now face.

‘Priviledge,’
not right

On page I0 of The Pitt News of
January 30 there appeared a half-
page ad seeking to persuade student
organizations to become certified by

the university. The headline in the ad
referred to “The following privi-
ledges [sic]...” While it is your privi-
lege to spell privilege in any way that
suits your fancy, even as ”privi-
ledge,” I suggest that this may not be
the most effective way to inﬂuence
your readers. As it now reads, “privi-
ledge” might denote a building abut-
ment, that is, a ledge, which a pigeon
uses for defecation, that is, a privy.

A Central View/ Lee Terkel

Kissinger :

Editor ’s note: This is the first in a

series of columns submitted by
members of the Central America
Mobilization Coalition (C/IMC), a
loca/l_v-based anti— U. S.-intervention
group.
The recent report of the National
Bipartisan Commission on Central
America advocated pouring billions
of U.S. dollars into Central Amer-
ica, which it arrogantly considers
America’s backyard.

the Vietnamization of Central America

We are compelled, the report
implies’ to embroil ourselves in Cen-
tral American war because “the tri-
umph of hostile forces could be read
as a sign ofU.S. impotence. It would
signify our inability to exercise our
power.” This is the verdict of a com-
mission that was set up by Ronald
Reagan to buy time for acceptance
of his U.S.-as-a—world-cop-policy.

Any commission headed by
Henry Kissinger, who was instru-

mental in the Ni.xon administation’s
illegal and secret intervention
against Chile, has only a slim chance
of urging nonmilitary solutions, so
its warlike recommendations should
come as no surprise

Reagan’s dubbing of his commis-
sion as “bipartisan” is an unsuccess-
ful attempt to show a national
consensus on the need to further
Vietnamize Central America.

Combat Chic

continued from page four

that children be weaned from vio-
lence altogether, starting with their
toys and then the violence they
watch on TV.

The new fashion that‘s sweeping
the country is something bordering
on “combat chic." People just can’t
get enough of those army fatigues
and camouflage "outfits, which are
selling out faster than retailers can
order them. Local newspapers did a
few features on this new fashion,
which has grown in popularity since
the U.S. proved itself on the battle-
fields of Grenada and maintains its
virility in Lebanon.

The very young children are the
ones who, are especially adamant in
following this trend. Parents are
found complaining that there aren’t
enough army clothes and uniforms
made in the right sizes to fit little
Johnny. Sure, I wear army clothes,
but I don’t have the mind of a naive
little boy.

All this mimicry reminds me of
the early stages of Beatlemania. In
the early 603, people couldn’t get
their hair cropped in the “Liverpool"
style fast enough to satisfy their need
for group acceptance.

All that’s needed is the music so
we can boogie in the barracks, but
maybe all those jazzy jingles from
the recruiting commercials will do.
There’s even one street car l’ve seen
in Pittsburgh that is painted in
camouﬂage colors and states “This
is the Army" on the side.

Maybe a new flavor of ice cream
will be introd ucted to commemorate
this new spirit, perhaps marine mint
mocha, or a special-edition beer can.
While we’re waiting, in peace time,
there’s time to plan for a new market
and new possibilities. The big ques-
tion wracking the minds on New
York‘s garment district must be,
“What will we sell if war really does
break out, peace signs and love

beads?"

Ian regime. They‘ve “only" killed
8,000 of their dissidents, compared
to the near 35,000 killed by El Salva-
dor’s death squads. Apparently, we
still patch up their war—ravaged econ
omies with several billion dollars
over the next six years.

In policy-making circles, discus-
sion of the,sCentral American “prob-
lem" is confined to assessments of
“how much” aid and “how effective"
it would be in achieving U.S. foreign
policy objectives. For example, per-
haps quadrupling military aid to El
Salvador is too high a political price
for Reagan to pay, but what ifthat is
the amount it takes to do the job?
Or, what if CIA support to the coun-
terrevolutionary invaders of Nicara-
gua proves counter productive by
strengthening Sandinista support?
These are the dilemmas of a govern-
ment that plays the role of world
cop.

The human rights dilemma is
expedially explosive politically; the
Democrats on the commission
proudly point to their wrestling ofa
major concession from Kissinger,
that of “conditionality.” But the
final report nevertheless judged the
idea of withholding military aid to
El Salvador until that government
gets a handle on its right-wing death
squads as “lack[ing] in credibility in
that it clearly conflicts with U.S.
security objectives.” In other words,
Washington will supply more and
more guns and tanks as long as it
feels it has to; human rights not
withstanding.

The commission made a predicta-
bly big deal out of the so-called
Soviet and Cuban threat_in the area.
To this day, Washington has not
presented a shred of evidence to
back its claim that countries like
Nicaragua and Grenada are being
used as Soviet-Cuban bases for
exporting communist subversion.
One commission member even dis-
missed discussion of the Soviet-
Cuban threat as “garbage."

American foreign policy-makers

know they must squelch revolution,

in Central America. They want to
allow American corporations to
keep on exploiting the resources and
cheap labor ofthese underdeveloped
countries. Foreign policy serves the
interests of big business. Our
government hates the “Cuban
model" and the “Nicaraguan model”
—- and any government that stands
against capitalist domination and
pledges to place human needs above
profit.

We Americans, especially young

people, must ask: Is Cuba a bad
place? Is Nicaragua a bad place? We
must answer these questions in order
to decide if it is worth it to die in the
wars our rulers want us to fight. Is it
too far-fetched to suggest that we
American working people have
more in common with the people of
Cuba and Nicaragua than we have
with our own corporate and political
leaders? Cubans and Nicaraguans
feel and understand these people—to-
people links. They are waiting
patiently for the American people to
come around.

Bank machines lure patrons

continuedfrom Page 0'19

Pittsburgh National Bank or a bank
which is an affiliate, they could use
their card to deposit and withdraw
money on their credit card, transfer
money from their credit card to their
checking account and make loan
payments.

According to Robert Lyles, Vice
President of Product Development
and Bank Operations at Pittsburgh
National Bank, an affiliate bank is a
member ofa “network of machines.”
That is a member 1 of the MAC
(Money Access Center) network.
Dollar Bank and Equibank arejust
two banking institutions here in the

' Pittsburgh area that are part of the

MAC network. Pittsburgh National
Bank’s MAC is similar to Mellon
Bank’s Cashstream network.
There are other advantages to the
service. Automated teller
machines offer 24-hour banking, or
“banking forever,” as Lyles puts it.
“ATM’s make routine banking tran-
sactions available anytime, thus pro-

viding access to accounts at all
times.”

The ATM has its disadvantages
which seem to fall under the catego-
ries of individual misuse and PIN
(personal identification number)
security measures.

The old adage “We are often our
own worst enemies” has some bear-
ing on the individual banking card
user. Robert Lyles said that there is a
tendency to overuse the banking
card convenience.

“Those who overuse the system
are the individuals who withdraw
five or ten dollars daily. They tend to
use their banking cards as a wallet.
Those persons not financially disci-
plined could become a problem.”

Lyles advises that the student put
himself on a personal budget. For
instance, a student may be operating
on a personal expenditure budget of
fifty dollars a month. He suggests
they get into the habit of withdraw-
ing once a week. “Don’t use the
MAC as a wallet," said Lyles.

Another banking official offers
the consumer additional advice.
Sandra J. McLaughlin, senior vice
president of Mellon Bank points out
that it isiessential that individual
banking card users continue to keep
their check book in balance.

“Keep a check register of some
sort. The ATM provides you with a
receipt for that purpose.” McLaugh-
lin said “Those using their ATM’s
should keep in mind that they need
to register withdrawals.”

Do ATM’s ever make mistakes,
and, if so what happens? The Fed-
eral Reserve Board under the stipu-
lations of the Electronic Fund

I Transfer Act of I978 acts as watch-
dog and reviewer of consumer com-
plaints regarding the use of
electronic fund transfers.

According to Schroeder, 6 per-
cent of those same households in
April of 1983, “Alleged that the
bank made an error because of the
EFT feature.” The Board reported
that the errors involved a misunder-
standing of the use of the ATM‘s, a
mechanical malfunction or an
accounting mistake rather than
errors in actual transfer of funds.

off at

   

ESSES .

The lastest available data, from
surveys taken at the end of 1982,
show that only 75 complaints con-
cerned banks not supervised by the
Board and the rest were referred to
other agencies. Of those 37 which
concerned banks supervised by the
Board, only three involved specific
bank violations.

Along with the personal discipline
necessary in the use of the banking
card there is the danger of an

unauthorized withdrawal. In other- 9»

words, someone has gained access to
your account and withdrawn funds
without your approval. In his arti--
cle, Schroeder points that less than I
percent of households with banking
cards reported ‘ an unauthorized
withdrawal of funds because of the
account
the use of a banking
machine.

McLaughlin of Mellon Bank
makes special note ofthe fact that an
unauthorized withdrawal rarely
happens and only does when it is the
result of unauthorized family use or
when the entire wallet is stolen. In
the latter case, the victim has usually
written their PIN on a piece of paper
and put it in their wallet somewhere.
Banking card users have their own
PIN — a four digit number that only
the owners ofthe card should know

McLaughlin says, “Do not keep
your PIN in your wallet or write it
on your banking card." She pointed
out that it was surprising the number
of people who did dojust that. She
also emphasized that you «should
choose a PIN which is familiar to
you but not familiar to anyone else.

Lyles of PNB pointsout that the
PIN is similar to the lock you have
on your gym locker and that you
should choose thisfour digit number
with precision and care.

He said, “The number should not

’.
Vi

be made easily accessible to a casual ‘W

acquaintance. Do not use your four
digit telephone number, your date of
birth or your street address.iThose
individuals who get a hold of some-
one else’s card know that many peo-
ple use this kind ofdata as a PIN and
will use these numbers if they get
your card.”

Lyles suggests that ifyou must use
a birthday to help you remember
your PIN, use someone else’s other
than your own. A

Clients of Dollar Bank do not
have the option of choosing their
personal code. Lynn McEnery
Clapp, assistant vice president of
Dollar Branch Administration said,
“Dollar Bank’s PlN"s are selected
randomly. Random numbers are
much more secure.”

But, as recently as Fall Semester
1983, students at the University of
Pittsburgh fell victim to banking
card thefts in the Oakland area. A
husband and wife team were found
guilty of over 200 counts of banking
card thefts. Inspector William Ward
of Police Station No. 4 pointed out
that not all the thefts the team were
involved in took place in the Oak-
land area.

Ward described their strategy as
follows in this way, “The man and
woman would go near a (banking
machine) while a banking card user
was placing his card in the machine.
One person would stand behind the
victim and watch as he punched in
his secret number. The other person
would distract the victim and take

(t
«J

the card." ‘ ‘

Ward pointed out that, “Some-
times the perpetrators could walk
away without even being disturbed!”

Ward said that since the team
have been apprehended he has had
very fewcomplaints regarding bank-
ing card thefts.

There are ways you can protect
yourself from such misfortunes.
McLaughlin of Mellon Bank offers
the following advice, “Stand directly
in front of the machine, detect if
someone is very helpful. It is per-
fectly legitimate to keep people wait-
ing ln“Ill’l€ until you put your cash
away.

Ward gives similar instructions,
“Be careful when using outside
machines. Don’t let any persn see
your secret number."

Banks_ join national F
machine network

By Gail Brick
For The Pitt News

The demand for convenience
and innovation has created a
powerful marketing tool for
local banks—automatic "teller
machines.

Tri-Net is a group of 19 banks
in the tri—state area affiliated with
the Atlantic Financial Corpora-
tion and is responsible for the
Money Access Center, affection-
ately called MAC. The MAC
network has 124 operational
banking machines in the Pitts-
burgh area and boasts 880,000
card holders in the tri—state area.

MAC’s biggest competitor is .

Cash Stream, which operates
about I50 machines in Pitts-
burgh and Western Pa., includ-
ing a new machine in the William
Pitt Union.

, Mellon Bank is the principal
institution in the Cash Stream
system and runs the main com-
puter. Union National Bank,
Century Federal Savings and

Loan, Landmark Savings and ,

Loan and Laurel Savings and
Loan have already linked into
the Cash Stream system. Sixty-
one additional financial institu-
tions are considering that option.

Cash Stream is not yet a year
old, and it’s already the fourth-
largest shared regional banking
network in the country. It claims
more than 700 machines in
Pennsylvania.

It is also linked to a national
system called Cirrus. With the
Cirrus system capabilities,
anyone with a Cash Stream card
can do his banking anywhere in
the country.

This adds convenience for
vacationers, eliminating the need
for traveler’s checks. It also helps
out-of-town students, who
would rather not change banks
while at school.

The Plus system is MAC‘s link
to nationwide banking. The four
principal MAC institutions—-
Pittsburgh National Bank, Equi-
bank, Dollar Savings and First
Seneca Bank—are not yet using
the Plus network, but it is
planned for the near future.

As automatic tellers gain
acceptance, the demand for
machines increases. The number
of operational MAC and Cash
Stream machines grows
everyday.

Innovation is also an impor-
tant aspect of the automatic
teller field. Dollar Savings is the
first institution in Pittsburgh to
code its keys in Braille. The
machines will talk to customers
in the near future.

Many retailers will soon pro-
cess their customers‘ transac-
tions through a debit card
system. Instead of paying cash in
a checkout line, a machine will

automatically debit customer‘s
account for the amount of pur-
chase. Pilot programs of this
nature have already begun in gas
stations and supermarkets.

The automated system has
brought its share of rewards to
the banking and retail industries.
Economists claim it encourages
people to spend now for what
they may need later. For retail-
ers, such as Giant Eagle, the
Cash Stream machines in every
store are an added drawing
mechanism.

For banks, membership in an
ATM system is a valuable mar-
keting tool. The machines are
geared toward those who can‘t
take the time to go into a bank. A
Dollar Savings spokesman calls
the machines a “fact of life. We
want to make our service availa-
ble to customers when they need
it.”

This kind of thinking shows in
bank advertising and promotion.
An Equibank spokesman said
“We’re keen on MAC, the level

of convenience is a. definite

success.”

Equibank even sponsored a
promotion with McDonald's, in
which anyone who showed his
MAC card received a free Big
Mac. Dollar Savings held a dem-
onstration at Century Ill Mall,
showing patrons how the
machine works. Those who tried
it got to keep the money that
came out.

In spite of the success, many
people are still afraid to use
banking machines. While secur-
ity standards are very high, the
margin oferror in most machines
is created by the user. It is advisa-
ble that users limit their transac-
tions to daylight hours and be
cautious of their security codes.

Most banks now offer
machines in their lobbies. This
gives the customer a choice
between the machine and a teller.
Tellers offer human service, but
they cost the bank more per tran-
saction. A bank teller works
eight hours a day, whereas a
machine works 24 hours. An
automatic teller does not get sick
or take vacations.

One bank spokesman went ‘so
far as to suggest that the human
teller will eventually be replaced.
According to an Equibank
spokesman, “It’s not a black-
and-white issue in saying an
ATM will replace a teller. As
banks get into more and more
businesses, you’re going to see a
realignment of banking

services.” . .
A Mellon spokesman said,

“There is no question, we’re
moving towards point of sale
transactions, which will deduce
the need for cash. But there will
always be a need for the human
element in banking. With the
machines, tellers are more avail-
able to help people plan their
finances."

Sullivan speaks to capaci

By Joe Zeff
The Pitt News

Tom Sullivan's ‘lecture-concert in
the William Pitt Union Multi-
Purpose Room last night was high-
lighted by a chance reunion with a
childhood friend sitting in the
audience- C

A His friend, John Turnbull, of
Sewickley Township, stood up dur-
ing the question-and-answer portion
of Su1livan’s program and asked,
“Tommy, can you play me a song?”

Sullivan, confused at first,
guessed the identity of “his first

friend” on the second try, after the’

"mystery man hinted, “I’ve got a
horseshoe in my pocket."

“That’s unbelievable,” exclaimed
Sullivan, his arms raised in the air
and his face flushed with excitement.

Turnbull said that he didn’t know
about the performance until last
night, when he saw a small
announcement in the back section of
a newspaper. i
_ “I said, -‘What the hell, why not go
and
afterward.

After a long-awaited hug, Sulli-
van recounted some boyhood
memories with Turnbull and Turn-
bull’s twin brother, Dave. Sullivan
said they were his first friends.

“When we were about four, we

see him,’ “'Turnbull said‘

traded a horseshoe for a gun, and he
stayed on the service end of it, I
guess," Sullivan said.

The two were reacquainted in a
private room in Williarn,Pitt Union
after the concert-lecture.

Sullivan‘s presentation was a les-
son in courage. More than 500 peo-
ple, including about 30 students of
the Pittsburgh School for the Blind,
listened to the performer crack blind
jokes, perform on the piano and

“Every being on this planet is‘

things that makes us special,” Sulli-
van said. “These things will deter-
mine our success and failure. Every
single one of those things is an
advantage or a disadvantage,
depending on how itiiis used. Every-
body in the world has a disadvan-
tage.” .

Sullivan introduced Diana, his
golden retriever, to the audience. He
said the dog was his “special pal. I

don‘t think I could a life without '

her.”

Sullivan doesn't consider his
blindness to be a disadvantage. He
said he never realized he was blind

request

By Colette Ferris
The Pitt News

The Student Government Board
yesterday rejected a request by the
Governmental Relations Commit-
tee for $1,260 in emergency funds to
attend a national conference.

The request for funds to attend
the National Student Conference at
Harvard University was denied on
the basis of a recommendation from
the Allocations Committee. The
conference, the Governmental Rela-
tions Committee argued, would
have helped in promoting voter
registration. I

Allocations Committee chairman
Steve Smith said, “We don‘t think
it’s worth the money ongcost benefit
anaylsis.” ,

Opposing the recommendation
was board member and former
Governmental Relations Commit-
tee member Avery Abrams, who
said, “The GRC has three major
goals and that [promoting voter reg-
istration] is one of them."

“Students generally are the most
underrepresented group in voting,”
said ex-committee member Connie
Kreischer.

The Governmental Relations
Committee now has the option of
formulating a new proposal to sub-
mit before the Allo-cations
Committee.

The board accepted the following
allocations requests:

0 Studio Theatre, $4001.46 for‘

three Winter Term shows.

0 Intrafraternity Council, $604. I 7
for their kick-off event to precede
Greek Week. _

0 The French Club, $533 for two

.51 Poetic

License

By LISA LaVALLE

Yes, Virginia, poetry can be inter-
tainingl Granted, it might be difficult
to believe that a seemingly dull docu-
mentary film, which captures the

Qgperformances of 23 poets, has any

possibility of being interesting. How-
ever, Ron Mann proves in his brillant
film, Poetry In Motion, that poetry is
exciting, enjoyable and especially,
alive.

Mann manages to intertwine an
array of poetic form and style. To
him, it is merely a question of how to

gybring poetry to life, and his answer to

this dilemma is settings — night-
clubs, studios, apartments. The mode
of presentation in the film creates an
explosive relationship between poet,
poem and audience. He illustrates the
difference between mere words on
paper and the actual performance of
material — which reveals the artist's
inner being.

An additional accomplishment of
the film is the bonding of music and
poetry, which the performers are
able to incorporate in a unique
manner. Allen Ginsberg, for exam-
ple, dressed in a three-piece suit, is
dazzling as he shouts social—political
poetry with a new wave band
(although he could use a few singing
lessons).

Ed Sanders creates the most dis-
tinct blend of music and poetry, com-
bining the sound of inventive
hand-held synthesizers with a pair of
scissors, while Tom Waits, last seen
in a small but interesting rolein Fran-
cis Coppola's Rumble Fish, depends
solely on his guitar.

Take a man (Charles Martin
Smith) and drop him off in the Cana-

-\ dian Yukon for six months. Give him

a tent, a rifle, two cratesof asparagus
sprouts and 2.4 cases of beer for survi-
val. Assign him to track down the
Canis Lupus (technical term for
”wolf”) and find out if they are
responsible for the near extinction of
Caribou deer. Title this project Never
Cry Wolf and captivate movie audien-
ces across the continent.

Based on the novel by Canadian
author Farley Mowat, Never Cry Wolf
follows Smith through an examina-
tion of not only the wolf but of him-
Qelf as well.

Left alone in the freezing Arctic by
an adventurous pilot, Brian Denne-
hey (Gorky Park), Smith tells us
through splendid narration his
thoughts, his fears and his
realizations.

Only two other characters are
presented in the film; both are Eski-
mos and only one speaks English.

When the temperature soars to a
glistering 45 degrees, Smith is able to
begin his search for the wolves. He
tracks down two rare white wolves
‘and their cubs and sets up ”Lupus"
camp to watch their behavior. But all
the wolves do is watch Smith’s
behavior. A series of funny episodes

Even in the absence of sound.

effects, the film is still very compell-
ping. One of the most memorable
scenes involves a woman named
Helen Adams. At first glance, this
gray-haired old woman looks like she
could be anyone's grandmother.'But,
alas, as soon as~she begins prancing
around her messy apartment singing
(if one could label it that) about

roaches, rats, LSD and death, she ‘

steals the show.

I Poetry In Motion is highly entertain-
ing; however, the poetic quality is
extremely inconsistent. The poems
range from the bizzare to the rotten
to the enlightening.

The Four Horsemen lift poetry to
different levels of sound abstraction,

fusing individual and group vocals to

create loud, strange noises, while
Kenward Elmair enhances his poetry
with the use of a ”box” blaring out a
rather nifty tune. John Giorno con-
tinuously yells line after repetitive
line. His ”insightful” lyrics include:

Allen Ginsberg appearhsmin oetry In Motion.

”Friends always become enemiesvif
you wait long enough” and ”Nothing
is more comfortable than watching
TV." ,
Enlightening, though, is Anne
Waldman's sensuous performance of
a poem dealing with "empty space.”
Her distinct voice captivates the
audience with its subtle. yet com-
manding tones, and one begins to feel
a sense of intimacy with the poet.
Poetry In Motion is not only enjoya-
ble, but its educational in that it
reveals an overlooked side of poetry

-—— the poet. Poetry, when lifted to 7

different heights of abstraction, leads
towards a phenomenology of percep-
tion. It clearly reflects an awareness
of some psycho-physiological charac-
teristic's of perception. Thus, is poe-
try merely inner joy or sorrow
drained from the poet?

This question is answered by frag-
mented interviews A with Charles
Bukowski. However, he needn't
really address the problem, for the

answer is’ clearly written on his face. .

And although his poetry isn't per-
formed, he may very well be the most
important figure in the film. He
believes that poetry is "prententious
bull," written by ”dumb assholes.” He
credits this factor in his decision to
return to writing poetry. He states
that he returned to writing not
because he was good but because oth-
ers were so bad. Moreover, he says
that he will continue writing as long
as modern poets keep turning out
”trash.”

Poetry in Motion attempts to destroy
the stereotyping of poetry. It shows
the audience that poetry isn't always
deep and philosophical — on the con-
trary, poetry can be a visual form of
art, full of refreshing, vibrant energy.

follow where Smith seals off his ter-
ritory in the natural way and con-
ducts a hilarious self-experiment
proving that the wolves could survive
on mice. Smith tries the delicacy in
soup, sandwiched between crackers
and even as a shishkabob. /

Smith eventually tracks down a
large Caribou herd, or rather, he. is
caught stark-naked in the middle of
one of their stampedes and finds the

real reason for the Caribou becoming

extinct.

This discovery, however, pales in‘
comparison to Smith's self-discovery.
When he comes upon Dennehey and
his hunting friends invading the
Yukon with their “civilization,” he is
disgusted with their talk of ”bottling
the Yukon air” and the endless furs
they could obtain. He decides not to
return to the world he left six months
ago but stay in this pristine, new
world he has found.

Director Carroll Ballard (The Black‘

Stallion) stuns us once again with
expansive nature shots and spectacu-
lar animal close-ups. The wild beauty
of the wolves and the wilderness is
capturedbrilliantly. Never Cry Wolf is
certain to make the viewer under-
stand his place‘in nature, not nature's
place in his world. A must for all ages.

By’BURTON.WHITE

It's a world far away, a world where
sin glistens like a star-struck pink
1959 Thunderbird convertible, a
world of young men telling old ‘war
stories, little hippie road-sluts and
poor, _pregnant Catholic girls. It's
where you know you're in love when
you "drop your ice cream cone on the
Sidewalk. It's Maynard, Texas --
home of laundry, bourbon and Lone
Star Beer, where the starshine you
see and wish upon may be coming
from a star that died thousands of
years ago without your knowledge.
It's the world of Elizabeth Caulder,
her husband Roy, Hattie Dealing,
Ray Caulder (Roy's brother), Amy
Lee Fullernoy and her husband Cle-
tus, better known as ”Skeeter." It is
the world of James McLure’s Laundry
and Bourbon and Lone «Star, the current
double bill at the Studio Theatre.

Laundry and Bourbon and Lone Star
show the women and men of May-
nard, _respectively,‘and the effect of
having lived a sheltered, small-town
existence. Although both plays are
often comic in dialogue and situation, I
remains the apathy of a
resigned ”wai-t-and-see-attitude," an
inability to act." All are trapped in this
existence, motivated only when occa-
sions arise to which they can react.
These‘ occasions include betrayal,
theft, infidelity, pregnancy, alcoho-
lism and abortion. Under the comic
veneer of the plays is a solid structure
of rural America, its daily life, dilem-
mas and dreams. '

Directed by Kenyon Barr and Jim
Robinson, respectively, Laundry and
Lone Star paint a vivid picture of life’ in
Maynard. The well-designed set dou-
bles as the backyard of the Caulder

Why do people think they can
direct themselves in the theatre? The
very nature of the art form makes the
attempt ludicrous. Raymond Laine is
performing the dual role of director/
lead actor in the current Playhouse
Theatre Company production of
American Buffalo by David Mamet.

Mamet, best at exploiting the dia-
louge of contempory human behav-
ior, created an epigraph of our times
with vivid, explosive language. The
play focuses on three low-life charac-
ters who engage in an illegal business

parallels the fraudulent behavior of

of decaying autos and Lone Star beer

. bottles. Music is used in both shows,

effectively accentuating moments
throughout the productions with its

.country—western flavor.

Both shows are well cast. Genia
Miller (Elizabeth) is striking onstage

. even in cut-off shorts, sandals and a

T-shirt. Although sometimes discon-
nected with her character, generally
she sustains the serious throughline
of Laundry. Dan Barnh-art (Roy) com-

fortably portrays the Army vet who

has had the opportunity to see more
than the others (like Oklahoma, for
example). His naturalness, although
sometimes static, balances well with
his "big story” dialogue. Josie Fisher
(Hattie) and Joe Comm (Ray) act as
the comic relief of the productions.
Ms. Fisher, with her thick accent,
reminds one of Carol Burnett's

interesting commentary and can be a
fascinating character study. This pro-
duction, however, left audience
members so bored during the first
act, many left during intermission.

There were so many problems
here: blown lines, slow pacing and
consistent- focus on Laine when it
should have been on the other actors
just to name a few. The bottom line,
or problem, is Laine's choice to both
act the lead role of Teach (doing an Al
Pacino impression in the first act) and
direct. .

Despite this annoyance, there were
some_ good qualities. The set was a
spectacular assortment of garage
sale/flea market items cluttering the
stage and spilling out into the orches-
tra, creatinga fascinating junk shop

"Eunice," although punch lines were
sometimes swallowed, scratching the
humor. Mr. Comm, who gave one of
the evening's most notable perfor-
mances, played the simple and rustic
Ray with such innocence and energy
that his even present grease rag
began to take on a life of its own. Cece
Donoghue (Amy Lee) was exemplary
in her ability to connect with both
'’faces'' of her character, making the
transitions between the demure and
offensive Baptist debutante with a
reserved energy that exploded in the
precise critical moments.

If the productions of Laundry and
Lone Star suffered any problem, it was
one of pacing. While both produc-
tions startedroff strongly, in both, the
pace slowed in the more serious
moments, opposite of what one
might expect. Theprice for this prob-

setting. So fascinating, in fact, that I
spent much of the evening checking
out the assortment of junk. Set
design is by Mary Burt.

John Amplas created a harrowingly
pathetic Bobby, the heroin addict, an
extremely difficult role to play with
honesty.

A special effect rainstorm in the
second act was interesting. Around
the time that the 55th drop of water
hit the windowpane, I lost track of
the plot of the scam to steal the buf-
falo coin that makes up the plot of the
story... The rainstorm was a soothing
distraction. _

THE GOURMET GUIDE TO BEER
Howard Hillman
Washington Square Press

The title isn't kidding when it says
”gourmet.” This book for discerning
beer lovers is not as high-falutin’ or
pretentious as the wine-tasting
columns in most newspapers, but
Howard Hillman is apparently deter-
mined to raise the social status of the
serious beer drinker. He's got the
influence to do his part; he'sa well-
known author of books on wines and
gourmet cooking, and he also lectures
frequently on beer and conducts
gourmet beer tastings.

To help the average person along
his way tobecoming an expert on
beer-tasting lingo, Hillman includes a
glossary of terms. This, however,
tends to be rather unilluminating

reading. Obviously influenced by’

wine—tasting experience, the glossary

ATTENTION ALL GRADUATE STUDENTS!!!

PROPOSED STUDENT ACTIVITY FEE INCREASE

A student activity fee of $2 per term (551 part-time) was established
for all graduatestudents in 1973. This fee is used primarily to support
academic and social activities within your own school. It is also used

  to provide graduate student discounts to activities sponsored by the
Pitt Program Council (PPC) and to fund the university-wide activi-
ties of the Graduate and Professional Student Association (GPSA).
Because ten years of inflation and added activities on all levels have
severely limited school budgets, a proposal to increase the activity fee
to $5 per term ($2 part-time) is being considered. Your respective
graduate schools will be voting on this proposal shortly. GPSA

At the heart of the book is the rat-

different brews, both American and

stars, ”a superb brew with unusually
distinctive qualities,” usually
reserved for expensive imports.
The ratings make, interesting

keep in mind that the tastes for var’-’

ious brews must be acquired. Many
people have no complaints about the
one- and two-star beers but find the
five—star ones unpalatable (and vice
versa).

Hillman includes some of the crite-

THIS ARE TWO-TONE
Various Artists
Chrysalis

As one of what seems like
dozens of movements on the
British rock scene since the mid-
’70s, ska occupies a unique page
in history‘. Ska never sought to
offend people in the way that
punk and the more recent "oi"
bands did. It never put itself on a
pedestal from which it could
only tumble, as was the fate of
new wave. Finally, it never
intended to impress the impres-
sionable with false glamor as did
the New Romantics.

No, ska was different. A mag-
ical mix of reggae’s rhythm and

intention combined with the

light touches of pop at the fore-

front, ska sets out to do only one

thing: ‘make people dance. And
dance they did, sending the 13
songs on this record skyrocket-
ing through the British charts.

This Are Tivo—Tone is a splendid
mini—anthology of ska: what it
was, what it became and how it
will‘ be remembered. Relying
almost exclusively on the four

CALL OF THE WILD
Ellen Shipley
Capitol

Ellen Shipley, it seems, has

‘ been around forever. She was at

the Decade several years back
(well, it was reallyabout three
years ago, but it seems longer),
and it appears that she's always
releasing another album. She's a
critics" darling, with five
reviews written for every
_album sold. Which brings us to

the question? If she's so good, 4

how come nobody buys her
stuff? A

Sometimes, the reason is that
the artist is almost too good —
the material is so far ahead of
the current market that it's only
listened to by a small number of
avant-garde types, or the mus-
ic's just not oriented to current
commercial radio —— like some of
the songs are 12 minutes long.
In the case of Ellen Shipley,
neither of those two reasons
-apply. It's much simpler than
that; people don't buy Ellen Shi-
pley records because they're
tedious, and no one wants to
subjecthimself to .40 minutes or
so of sheer boredom.

Call Of The Wildis one droning
song after another, with Shi-
pley showing neither the song

. writing skills nor the "whallop—

packed ‘rock" voice (the bio
sheet's description, not mine)
she supposedly possesses. To
these ears, she sounds more like
a Terri Nunn (Berlin) clone with
a bad case of depression than
the "vixenish rocker" (again, the
bio sheet’s words) she's being
touted as.-

If Call Of The Wild is Ellen Shi-
pley at her most primitive, get
out the hunting license. Extinc-
tion of this beast is in order.

Ska-ter's Waltz

(the Specials, the Selecter, Mad-
ness and the English Beat), this
record takes you on a roller-
coaster ride through the amuse-
ment park of ska.

Opening with one of the
movement's first hits, the Spe-
cials’ "Gangsters," side one is a
treasure chest filled with some
of ska's finest gems. The side

accurately Captures the won-'

derful early days and rollicks to
a close with the Selecter’s infec-
tious "Too Much Pressure" and
the English Beat's "Ranking Full
Stop.”

Unfortunately, it wasn't long
before someone got the idea of
dropping political notions on
the heads of kids who couldn't
stop dancing long enough to
realize their scene was being
taken over. Although the music
matured and gained in complex-
ity, the plot was unnecessarily
thickened. ‘

Side two goes on to shed light
on this downfall. While the Spe-
cials’ "Two Much Too Young”
and the Selecter’s instrumental
"The Selecter” are interesting

enough, a certain loss of inno- *

cence is obvious. By the time the
Specials’ haunting social com-

AFOOT
Let's Active
I.R'.S

Mitch Easter, that puppy-
faced kid best known for pro-
ducing such bands as R.E.M.
and the Bongos, has ventured to
the other side of .. the mixing
board to form his own group,
Let's Active. The result, Afoot, is

oneof the most marvelously

simplistic and sweet pop EPs
since the Archies’ single
appeared on the back of Post

' cereal boxes.

Easter, along with bassist
Faye Hunter and drummer Sara
Romweber, have managed to
rip off sugary, '60s pop- in the
vein of Paul Revere‘ and the
Raiders, early Beatles and, yeah,
the Archies without being vam-
piric. There's enough borrowed
licks here to be nostalgic, but
Let's Active knows where to
stop being parastic and start
sounding original — Easter’s
songwriting takes care of that.

Side one opens with the mini
album's best song, "Every Word
Means No," an irresistible ditty
that has been released as the
first single. On this, Easter’s
vocals and guitar go downvlike a
butterscotch sundae on a hot
summer night. The same goes
for "Leader Of Men,” "Make Up
With Me” and, actually, the
other three songs on the EP.

The album was recorded at
Easter’s famed Drive-in studio
and reflects this boy—wonder’s
penchant for doodling with
recording and musical gizmos.

This gives /lfoot an original edge _

and keeps it from being mere
copycat music.

Yes, this album displays
Mitch Easter’s versatility as
both a musician and a producer,
and yes, it's an unintentional

tribute to '60s pop. Mostof, all

mentary "Ghost Town” winds
down the album, the bands here
are not merely serving notice to
the people they liken to the liv-
ing dead; they are digging their
own graves as well.

The fact that ska lasted only a
short time as a musical force in

though, this album is great fun,

‘and with the recent resurgence

of consciousness music, that
counts for a lot.

CHEAP AT HALF THE PRICE
Fred Frith '
Ralph Records

This is one of the greatest
shocks I've weathered lately, I
swear. What every Henry
Cow/Art Bears/Material fan
would be eager to get his paws
on — a collection of 4—t‘rack
home recordings -—- has proved
to be fun in spots but more
often disappointing. Let's estab-
lish now that, no, this is not a
very good _record for the general
purchaser. But for the hardcore
fan, God, pick it up. Get this:
Frith sings. He sings like Kermit
the Frog. The lyrics seem to
have been irfluenced by years
of accompany: 1g Chris Cutler’s
and Tim Hodgkinson's (Henry
Cow) raving restatements of
Marxist doctrine but still man-
age to meet the Ralph Records

silliness quotient. After all,‘

anyone can sound like the Resi-
dents if they try hard enough.

Although Frith is not, from
this evidence, a great "songwri-
ter," he has competently
cranked out a few pleasant light
pop songs. The second side loos-
ens up a bit and fits in more
logically with what we've been
hearing from him elsewhere.
Parts of this side approach the
beauty and terror of which Frith
has shown he is capable, but
nowhere does he come close to
the power of the second Henry
Cow and the first Art Bears
albums. It just goes to prove
that Ralph can ruin the best of
them.

Musical Youth

Question{ How many of you
who actually bought last year's
"Pass The Dutchie" listen to it

' now?

Of course, I can't really
answer that question, but tak-
ing a guess, I'll venture to say
not many of you. "Pass The
Dutchie" was a cute little
sidebar in a year filled with new
sounds and groups, but it cer-
tainly didn’t make ‘a lasting
impact.

Musical Youth was cute, too,
a bunch of young kids, some
with adorable exotic accents,
fronting their own band. No
weird clothes or members of
questionable gender, just five

- clean-cut boys who sang reggae

palatable enough for the masses
who were scared off by the dred
looks of real reggae artists like
Peter Tosh. Thing is, folks like
Peter Tosh don't rely on age and
cuteness to sustain them, which
is why — in the long run -—- they
endure.

There's still time for Musical
Youth to grow old and start
twisting their hair into weird
concoctions, but, at least for the
present, it seems like they're
gonna stay cute and young —
and boring and bland. Different
Style! contains nothing that dif-
fers from last year's debut
album — just more adorable
reggae numbers, mostly penned
by other artists (Boy George,
Lamont Dozier, Bruce Sudano
and Stevie Wonder).

And no, it doesn't include
"Unconditional Love," the song
they recorded with Donna
Summer.

BILLY moi '
Stanley Theatre
Ianuary 31, 1984

By LESLIE VAN BUSKIRK
When Billy Idol hit the Stanley

Theatre's stage last Tuesday night to
the strains of the theme from Mission

nlmpossible, it was with an appropriate

«ﬁt

note of irony. As he himself noted, he

started out in the punk rock move- ‘

ment ‘of 1977 but wasn't considered
one of that era's leaders. Television,
The Sex Pistols, even Blondie were
the wave's messiahs, the hopes for a
brighter rock—n-roll future. Billy Idol
was just another poor boy who sang
for a rock—n-roll band (Generation X).

Seven years later, it's not Johnny
Rotten or Debbie Harry soaking in
the stench of mass adulation; no, it's
somebody no one ever thought
would hold on that long. Mission
accomplished.

It's amazing what a little bit of time
can do. Two years ago, no one in
America knew who Billy Idol was -
he couldn't even get a club gig. MTV
was little more than word of mouth
in October of 1982, but word of

mouth was enough to make Pitts-
burgh's most daring nightclub,
Heaven, crowded with fans who
knew all the words to ”Dancing With
Myself." 1983 was, of course, the
year Martha Quinn became a house-
hold name, but, more importantly,
the year of video breakthrough. Billy
Idol, with his beautiful boylmean
man contradictions was the perfect
video star; ”White.Wedding”was put
back on MTV’s heavy rotation list
several months after it had hit that
same list and plummeted. The self’-
entitled album released in the
summer of 1982 was the runaway hit
of 1983. Billy Idol, the punk of the
'70s, has finally found his niche in the
new wave video madness of the '80s.

It seems odd that Idol's undeniable
appeal has taken so long to catch on.
Like the Heaven show in 1982, his
concert on Tuesday highlighted a

performer with fully—rounded skills. .

’ Those of you who enjoyed
romping around on the dance
floor to "Mickey" will probably
be disappointed by most of Toni
Basil's new self—titled album.
But no song on the album tries

'~ to copy "Mickey" (luckily), and .
we see a side to Basil that we
didn't see on her distorted debut
effort Word of Mouth. 

This seems to be the mature
Toni Basil. She has trouble with
a straightforward style (at times
she can sound like a combina-
tion of Linda Ronstadt, Sheena
Easton and Debbie Harry, if you
can imagine that), but at least
the disc is likeable. Lyrics are
much more human than they
were on Word of Mouth; she talks
about a’ love affair that's more
theatrical than anything on
"Best Performance” (Even your
best performance/Won't" get
him back") and about day to day
self—triumph and fame called
"Go For The Burn" ("No one
said it was a piece of cake.").

A steadier, heavier beat domi-
nates the album — some nifty
rock and roll ("Over My Head"
and "Best Performance”); some
energetic dance cﬂuts (”Street-
Beat" and "So You Wanna
Dance.7"). Here, Basil's catty
sarcasm (which reached.sicken—
ing heights on Word of Mouth) is
pretty much under control.

Yet for all of its bright
moments (notable ‘(Go For The

Q Burn" and "Do You Wanna

Dance.7"), the new' Toni Basil
album is not quite an album. Get
rid of ”Space Walkin' The Dog,"
get rid of "I Don't Hear You"

left is an enormously entertain— ‘

indeed, the title fits. And maybe he
can't dance —-— we've all seen the
clenched fist-waving he's famous for
— but at least he knows how to move
and build up a sweat. His guitar-
playing isn't great (he leaves the great
stuff up to American guitarist Steve
Stevens), but it's, at the very least,
adequate. The song-writing skills
speak for themselves: "Flesh For Fan-
tasy," "Untouchables," "White Wed-
ding," ”Dancing With Myself" and
"Rebel Yell” are all good songs to
begin with, but they sounded just as

- good in concert as on vinyl. With the

video age we're in now, it's likely that
we'll find many performers who are
hot on video but sorely lacking in the
”live" department — Billy Idol is not
one of them.

Idol's pacing was good, also,-throw-i

ing in old and new fast and slow, and
even doing Generation X's semi-
classic, "Ready, Steady, Go!" mid-
way through the concert. The crowd,
most between the ages of 13 and 18
sang along with the chorus, but how
they knew this anthem, released in
America in 1978 to no airplay, is
beyond me, Apparently, Billy Idol
must mean a lot to them if they
bothered to scrounge up copies of the
six—year—old record to soothe their
recently insatiable appetite for his
music. And, as if 13 songs weren't
enough of a meal, the ' crowd

one.

Chipman readies
for ‘new’ season

By Charlie O'Hara
The Pitt News

Things certainly do not look
promising for the Panther basket-
ball team after Wednesday nights
loss on the road to Providence, 78-
66. The game marks the end of the
first half of Big East Conference play
and the Panthers have a 2-6 record
to show for it.

The conference play began with
such optimism. People were talking
of Pitt contending for one of the top
spots but at the present time, only
Seton Hall holds them from the cel-
lar position. _

This reality has Coach Roy Chip-
man a little disheartened.

“We don’t have a lot of leadership
on the floor," Chipman said yester-
day. “At the beginning of the season
we thought Billy [Culbertson] could
do that. But we put too much pres-
sure on him with Curtis Aiken com-
ing in and everybody saying that he
was going to take Billy’s spot.”

Chipman wants that guy who can

motivate the others.

“Clyde [Vaughan] _isn’t a holler
type guy," he said. “We’ve got/to give
somebody that responsibility so that
we can generate some of those
feelings.”

Before yesterday’s team meeting‘

Chipman spoke of giving Culbert-

son that free hand to lead the squad‘

for the rest of the season.

The Panthers’ problem, however,
is more than discovering a leader.
No lineup has yet provided the team
with consistency.

Wednesday, Chipman decided to
submit junior Andre Williams to the
starting line-up over Chip Watkins
for offensive production. He also
used Jeff Robinson for the first time
in a long while for the same offensive
strategy.

But for these supposed offensive
additions which resulted in 61.7 per-

cent shooting, Chipman traded the
rebounding and defensive strength.
The result was plain: a 27 point per-
formance from the Friars’ Otis
Thorpe.

- The team needs a second forward
and a center who complement each
other. The Watkins-Keith Arm-
strong combination is not it, nor the
Williams-Armstrong.

“That certain chemistry isjust not
there,” Chipman said. “The ‘best
we’ve played [this season] was in the
tournament [Golden Triangle Clas-
sic. in December] against Illinois
State. We played Clyde, Armstrong,
Watkins, Culbertson and [George]
Allen.” - P

The Panthers have tried too many

looks throughout the season and

none have been successful for more
than two games.

“I really thought after the trip to
Madison Square Garden that we
were putting things together,” Chip-
man said.

Pitt had just beaten ‘Seton Hall
and St. Johns and were readying for
Syracuse and Georgetown. . ,

Now on the edge of a three-game

losing skid (Syracuse, Georgetown '

and Providence) and the second half
of the strenuous Big‘East schedule
staring them. in the face, Pitt must
put together a team - if not from
scratch, close to it. -
“It’s going to be interesting to see
whether we've improved or dropped
off. Right now I would say we have
dropped off,” Chipman said.

With the tip-off set at 2:00 tomior-I

row at the Fitzgerald Field House,
Boston College and the CBS
national television audience will. find
out what Chipman’s new team idea
will consist of.

Freshman forward Marlon Fer-
guson could well be a part of the
plan. Perhaps he can supply the
team that combination of offense
and defense lacking in the current
line-up. ‘

Duchesses
crowned
by [Pitt

By Laurie Kubli
The Pitt News

The Lady Panther basketball
team expected a quick and
scrappy Duquesne team, but
notions ofthe Duchesses’[within
minutes of the tip-off] lack of
offensive output were kept care-
fully tucked away. That defi-
ciency became painfully clear to
the Duquesne fans who had
made the cross-town trip to Fitz-
gerald Field House Wednesday
night. i

This is part of Duquesne‘s
initiation into Division I basket-
ball. A new coach and a despar-
ate lack of height complicate
matters enough to justify a
roller-coaster season for the
Duchesses, who have endured
many more downs than ups at
5-12.

Duquesne suffered a lopsided
loss, 84-55 at the hands of an
established Division I team, but
it was by no means its first.The
new kid in town has been buried
by 30 or more points by the con-
ference rivals Penn State and
Rutgers, as well as Cheyney
State and Auburn

~. Kim Tirik

»Coach Paul Hindes had high
hopes _but realistic expectations
going into the contest with Pitt.

“I am not surprised at the
score,” he said. “We’re going to
work on developing a program
that will defeat Pitt, but it never
happens in the first year. I would
have been happy if they had
walked out and given it all they
had. You have to expect these
ups and downs."

Hindes’ squad showed Pitt

25% in the first half and 33% for
the game can not realistically
hope to win. Of the most active
players, one stands at 6-1 and the
remaining five average less than
5-8.

“We really need to do more
boxing out,” said Duchess Carol
Burchlaw, who was held to eight
points. “We need to make up for
the lack of height.”

Coach John Vasvary will take the
Panther track team south of the
border this weekend as he heads for
the Virginia Military Institute Win-

_ ter Relays in Lexington, Va. ln.fact,

Vasvary’s Panthers will be the only
team at the relays from north of the
“Mason-Dixon line.

Even though they are the only
Yankee team at the meet, they are
far from unknown to their southern
competitors. When the Panthers left
Lexington last year, they took home
second place and possibly more
important than that, a team.

After the meet last year, Vasvary
said they “walked in as a group and
left as a team.”

This year, however, things are
different. V

For starters, this year the meet is
not team-scored, so even if Vasvary
wanted to try for the same effect it
wouldn't be possible and second,
.V_’as‘va‘ry believes he already has the
team spirit this year.

“Different things are _important
this year,” Vasvary said. “It was an
important meet for the team last
year. I feel we had that kind of a
meet in North Carolina already this
year.”

Panthers go back to VMI

The Panthers will head to Virginia
minus one of their better known
members. Hurdler Roger Kingdom,
the relay‘s outstanding performer
last year, is traveling to Texas to
compete in the Dallas Times Invita-
tional this weekend.

Even without Kingdom, Vasvary
takes a powerful team with him to
Virginia. Senior Todd Colas, ranked
first in the 1000-meter run in the
NCAA will compete in the l500-
meter run and the 2-mile relay along
with teammates Bill Moorhead,
Alan Laws and Tim Manes. Laws
and Manes, both freshman, have
been outstanding in their rookie
campaign with the Panthers.

“Tim has done a real goodjob this
year,” Vasvary said. “He won the
600-meter run here [Pitt Invita-
tional], the 800-meter run at North
Carolina, the 880-yard run at Ohio
Sate and took fifth against a strong
field at East Carolina,” said
Vasvary.

“And Alan, Alan...," says Vasvary
as his eyes roll toward the ceiling of
the Fitzgerald Field House.

All Laws has done as a freshman
is become an integral part of Pitt’s

distance medley relay which has

already qualified for the NCAA
Championships and has one of the
fastest times in the nation.

This week Laws will have some
different Panthers joining him in the

distance medley relay. Jeff Longbot-
tom, John Thomas and Bob Weiner
will join Laws to make a rare all-
freshman relay.

“We want to try some people in
some different events this weekend,”
Vasvary said. “This will be a work-
out for some of the guys. They may
be running two events close
together, but it will help down the
road.”

And, if there is one thing that Vas-
vary’s Panthers do, it‘s go down the
road. And go down it fast.

TRACK NOTES: Along with the
Panthers will be North Carolina,
N.C. State, Richmond, Clemson
and other teams from the southeast-
...Vasvary expects an excellent field

Ladies
sprint to
Jersey

By Dale Moore
The Pitt News

The Pitt Lady Panther track team
travels to the Ivy League this week-
end ‘to compete in the Princeton
Invitational. However, the New Jer-
sey campus will not be overrun with
Pittsburgh blue and gold.

‘ The rules of the meet state that no of
competitor can run in more than two

events, so the Lady Panthers are tak-
ing only four team members and
entering two events.

Lady Panther Renee Henderson,
who set a new school mark of 6.99
seconds on her way to qualifying for

the NCAA Championships in the '

55-meter dash, will compete at that
distance again this weekend. She
will be joined by teammate Gail
Counts.

The Lady Panthers will also com-
pete in the sprint relay. Leading off
for Pitt will be freshman Felicia
Blake, running the 800 meter leg of
the relay, followed by Counts and
Henderson each running 200 meters.
Freshman Edie Butler will anchor
the Lady Panthers, running the final
400 meters.

Coach Elbert Kennedy, Jr. thinks
the meet is important for his squad
in terms of experience.

“Sprinters have to run more

races," said Kennedy. “In the sprint“

relay each girl will have a chance to
run her specialty. The handoffs may
be rough because the girls will be
handing off to someone different
than they are used to, but the girls
will get to run their events.

“Right now, races are what we
need,” Kennedy said. “Felicia has
only run in one 800 and she fell down
in it. She will berunning in that
event at the Big East Champion-
ships."

So while the Lady Panthers may
be entering few events, they stand to’
gain a large amount of experience.
And with the Big East Indoor Track
Championships only two weeks
away, nothing may be more impor-
tant than experience to Kennedy

and the Lady "Panthers. _ _ ﬁ _ _ _ ,.

It is rare for a swim team to have
an easy meet at this time of year, but
the Lady LPanthers should not
encounter any problems with
Youngstown State Saturday after-
noon at Trees Pool.

Head coach David Belowich will
have the swimmers participate in
their second-line events.

“lt’s the sort of a meet where you
swim the different events just for the
heck of swimming them,” Belowich
said. “We seldom have this oppor-
tunity to swim these second events."

“lt’s a primer [the meet] for the
girls‘ to do their second stroke,”
assistant coach Sandy Bizal said.
“They‘re looking good and feeling
good."

For example, freshman Susan
Hickman, normally a sprint free-
styler, will swim the 500-yard free-
styleand Jodi O'Neil, a breaststroke
specialist, will participate in the 200-
yard backstroke and the I000-yard
freestyle.

“It should be a lot offunjust to see
how Susan [Hickman] does," Bizal
said. “It will be a test of her mental
discipline." ’

“She [Hickman] is looking
foward to it,” Belowich said. “The
girls really want to see how they’ll do
in some of these events."

Before the season began, the Lady
Panthers were faced with a lot of
questions — among them, how the
freshmen and sophomores would
respond. So far, the squad, which
has compiled a 5-! dual meet mark,

 

 for Youngstown

has showed some promising results
in answer to those questions.

“You don’t get a team like this
that often,” Belowich said. “They’re
so motivated as a team. They
approach each meet the same. We're
very lucky to have this cohesiveness.
Everyone on this team is a leader.
The way they have meshed is quite

- special.”

It has been the freshmen, like
Hickman and O'Neil, who have
supplied the nucleus to Pitt.

“lt’s nice to get freshmen who can
win,” Bizal said. “We only have two
juniors and one senior, so when the
freshmen win a race, there are a lot
of people who back them up.”

Tomorrow’s meet may not call on
the team’s depth but some interest-
ing results should come of out the
events.

Former Pitt standout Joe
Luxbacher has been named the
new head soccer coach at Pitt.
He will replace Leo Bemis, who
retired after the 1983 season.
Bemis has been the only Panther
soccer coach since he started the
program 30 years ago.

The 32-year-old Luxbacher
served as an assistant to Bemis
last season, his third such stint at
the university.

During his playing career,
Luxbacher set two school
records that still stand: most

H goals in a game (7) and most

goals in a career(35). In I973, his
senior year, he was named the
team’s most valuable player.

her hired

After college he went on to
play professionally with the Phil-
adephia Atoms of the North
American Soccer League in 1974
and I975, the Pittsburgh Miners
of the American Soccer League
in I976 and the Pittsburgh Spirit
of the Major Indoor Soccer
League in 1978-79.

Luxbacher obtained a bache-
lor’s degree in biological sciences
in 1974 and a masters degree in
health, physical and recreational
education in 1978. He is cur-
rently completing his doctorate
work in administration of physi-
cal education and athletics at
Pitt.

Joe Femiani has returned to the
—Panther gymnastics team, but he’s
playing a different role now. Femi-
ani is now an assistant coach under
Frank D’Amico.

As a gymnast at Pitt, Femiani was
a four-year letterman and co-
captain of the team his senior year.
He was an all-around performer
until his sophomore year, when he
pulled ligaments in his right knee
which forced him out of action for a
short time. ~

When he returned, he specialized
in events where his knee ‘would not
_hamper his abilities. So he settled

makes the transition tocoaching

Femiani had been coaching pri-
vately and on the high school level
for over eight years, but he wanted
to coach at the collegiate level.

“I prefer coaching college gym-
nasts," he said. “They are more
mature and want to learn more diffi-
cult skills.”

I When Femiani was part of the

I gymnastics team, Dave Smith, now

a senior member of the team, was a
young Pitt gymnast who was influ-
enced by Femiani’s leadership.

“Joe always helped me," Smith
said, “rm glad he is here to coach.
He works out with us and it is like he
never left the team.”

Despite being away from the sport
for a year and a half now, the com-
petitive ﬂame still remains with
Femiani.

 

“It is harder being a coach because
I still want to compete," he said.

“Being a coach, I am learning to
appreciate gymnastics from a differ.-

PIKA---THE MARK or EXCELLENCE

Pitt tops  

Duquesne

continued from page seventeen
iCoaches and players alike accu-

, rately predicted swarming defenses

and a physical battle between the
rivals. Play was often halted while a
player tended to a split lip or a pile-
up was untangled for ajump-ball. It
was not bitter, however, but hard

' fought, as indicated by the 47 per-

sonal fouls committed by the two
teams. ‘

As with most local meetings, sev-
eral players have at _least seen each
other play, or played for or against
each other. They and the coaches are
enthusiastic about beginning the
cross-town series.

“The score wasn’t anything like I
expected,” Pitt guard Kim Gannis
said. “I played against most of them
in high school and they played the
same but on a higher level."

Kim Tirik, a starter who was
taken out early to give more players
court time, has also competed
against Duquesne players.

“I like playingagainst people I
know.” she said. “I'd like to do it all
the time."

Duchess Maureen Major, who
scored 1 I points, had mixed feelings
about the game.

“It was nice playing against them

again, and’I like the floor—the Civic
Arena‘s cold, with ice under it,” she
said. “I expected ‘us to play better;
we’re not 30 points worse than them.
I would definitely like to play them
again.”

With Duquesne’s appearance of
the big league scene, albeit it a mod-
est entrance, an intense rivalry with
Pitt is not out of the question. There
are several advantages to this,
according to Pitt coach Judy Saurer.

“We do want to play them again—-
they've asked us to come to the Civic
Arena (next season)? Saurer said.

, “Economically and academically it's
advantageous, it’s a short drive
away. It also is good for the press
coverage.”

Pitt’s Jennifer Bruce, leading’

scorer for the night with 23,
explained the game a little further.
“Theygave us a run for it at first, but
we lowered their confidence really
fast.”

Duquesne’s Tracy Sansosti ana-

lyzed the contest from another
perspective.
. “We should’ve tried to run more,“
she said. “We didn't get the boards;
we need some big people to get
them.”

Height will surely be priority in
Hindes’_recruiting. For now, he will
be concentrating his efforts on deter-
mining what makes his team tick.

“They had another reason to be
up, but they weren’t,” Hindes said as
his team just lost to Robert Morris,
58-55, Monday night. “You have to
be able to walk offthe court satisfied
with the effort you gave.

Pitt readies for BC

continued from page seventeen
In their first meeting with the
Eagles, Pitt clearly out-rebounded
but had trouble putting the ball in
the goal at the crucial moments of
the second half.
Now, the Panthers must be con-
cerned" with putting their entire
game together at one time in order to
avoid the Big East’s second division.
“We’re definitely going to discuss
Marlon playing,” Chipman said.
“We know he can play both [offense
and defense]. We have to have sta-
bility from that position.”

x. Another important aspect need-
ing correction is Vaughan's willing-
ness to hit the offensive boards.

think Clyde has been as active on the
offensive boards. Last year he was
banging the offensive boards.
Against Providence I think he had

' one offensive rebound. He has got to

spend more time hittingthe offen-
sive boards."

Many defensive improvements
must occur if Pitt is to defeat Boston
College tomorrow. In their last
meeting Jan. 4, forward Jay Murphy
and guard Michael Adams com-
bined for 49 points in Boston Col-
lege's 81-77 win at Roberts Center.

""We’ve got to do a better job
controlling [Jay] Murphy,” Chip-
man said. “We have to get back
quickly because [Micheal] Adams is
so darn quick.”

Pitt wrestlers win;

  

. Warren Dillaway/ Pitt Sports Information"
P1tt’s 190-pounder Jack Uppling was bested Wed-
nesday at Ashland College

By Mike Siberini
The Pitt News

The Pitt wrestling team snapped a
four-match losing streak by defeat-
ing Division 11 power Ashland
(Ohio) College, 19-16 on
Wednesday.

“It was nice, a nice change," said
head coach Rande Stottlemyer.
“They’re a good team (13-2) and the
win has got to help us. Whoever we
beat it would have been great. A win
is a win.”

The Panthers scored team points
in six out of the first seven matches

' to coast to the victory. JeffJelic con-

tinued his winning ways, hammering.
out a superior decision (19-7) in the

167 pound match, while teammate
John Hnath scored a major decision
(10-1) at 134 lbs. Jelic’s win was the
70th of his collegiate career, a school
record.

The match started out with Hal
Bolin letting a 12-8 lead slip to a
14-14 tie in the 118 pound match
against Rick DiCola. According to
Stottlemyer, the Pitt freshman

broke a cardinal rule and got too '

defensive late in the contest.

Pitt won the next two matches to
open up a 9-2 lead, Kyle Nellis
wrestled a “mistake-free match,”
according to his coach and shut out
Gary Sinko 5-0 at 126 lbs. and
Hnath countered with his nine-point
win over Jeff Kullman.

“John wrestled the best match of
the evening," Stottlemyer said. “He
showed more explosiveness and
innovativeness than he has in a
while.” ,

The Panthers then got their
second draw of the night as Gary
Bolin battled Jack Leonti to a 3-3
decision in the 142 pound match.

After Joe Throckmorton, who is
still recovering from an infected

prep for quad-match

arm, dropped an 8-3 verdict to Todd,-.

Winter at 150 lbs., Joe Bond and
Jelic scored Pitt's last two wins at
158 and 167 lbs., respectively. Those
victories_made the 19-7.

The Eagles came back somewhat
in the upper. weight classes, taking
the last three matches ofthe evening.
Kurt Joseph, Jack Uppling and Curt
Conner dropped safe, three-point
decisions as the Panthers held on for
a three-point team win.

Pitt will. take the momentum
gained in this victory into an intense
quad-match this Saturday in Anna}-«V
polis, Maryland. The Panthers will”
compete in the event along with
Navy, Maryland and Old Dominion
University. Those three teams were
recently ranked 19th, 20th and 21st
in the NCAA’s midseason poll.

Stottlemyer noted that all three
teams, especially Navy and Mary-
land, are solid throughout their
lineups. .

“Navy really doesn’t have any
superstars, they have 10 solid indi-
viduals," he said. ‘‘They’ll have two

full teams that can go so that tells ,

you what kind of team they have;
They just have a lot of depth."

Against Navy, Stottlemyer is
especially anxious to see the mat-
chup at 167 lbs. between Jelic and
sophomore John Reich.

“It will be a» challenge for him
[Jelic]," he said. “At this point in the
season that‘s what he needs. 1t
should be exceptionally fun to
watch.”

“Maryland is also pretty consist-
ent, depth-wise,” the coach added.
“They have no holes, nowhere where
you’re going to get a blowout every
match.”

The schedule (Navy at 1 p.m.,
Maryland at 3 p.m. and Old Domin-
ion at 5 p.m.) will give the Panthers
aboutan hour rest in between each
contest. Stottelmeyer said that he
will try to use one unit throughout

the day, but will bring four extras '»

along just in case of an injury.
