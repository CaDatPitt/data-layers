Bone marrow  
drive to start a
next week

By Mahita Gajanan
Staﬁ-' Writer

For one Pitt alumnus, a simple
cheek swab was enough to begin
a process that would eventually
help save a child’s life.

A In 2010,]enna Tamburro, then
a sophomore, registered at Pitt’s
ﬁrst annual bone marrow drive
sponsored by the Nursing Stu-
dent Ass°ociation through DKMS,
a bone marrow donation. center.
The next year, Tamburro found
out she-was a potential match for
a cancer patient, and after some
blood work and a physical, discov-
ered that her bone marrow was
suitable to be transplanted into
a patient. A _

This year, NSA will holdtits
third bone marrow drive with
DKMS on April 2 and 3 from 9 a.m.

to 5 p.m. in the William Pitt Union.- '

Nursing students Rebecca Spon-
berg, Lindsey Pretsch and Jarae
Payne organized the event.

At the drive, students who

are interested in donating bone-

marrow will have a nurse swab
the inside of their cheek with a
cotton swab. The interior lining of
the cheek provides a persons hu-
man leukocyte antigen, a protein
on the body’s cells that allows the
immune system to recognize the
cells as its own, said Sponberg,

, ‘the’ vice president of NSA.'This

test will allow potential candidates
to ﬁnd out if they are eligible to
donate bone marrow. - - ’

“It’s important that the donor’s
HLA matchesthe recipient’s HLA‘
so ‘the immune system will ac-
cept it,” Sponberg, a sophomore,
said. ‘

Sponberg said that in the past
two years, 604 students have reg-

, istered as donors. Out of the 604,

19 students have been contacted

C as actual matches and 6 of the 19
-have gone through the marrow
donation process. None of the

organizers could estimate how

With Wednesday’s announcement
of the ﬁfth and sixth bomb threats
to take place on Pitt’s campus this
semester,‘ some students have
grown accustomed to the buzz of
Emergency Notiﬁcation System
texts in their pockets.

Freshmen Katelyn Witmer and
Melissa Karl said that the most re-
cent ENS alerts have caused them
annoyance rather than worry.

“I feel-a text in my pocket, and

I think that it’s someone texting .

to talk to me, but then it’s just Pitt
again,” Witmer said.

' .Pitt’s ENS alerts provide text

messages, phone and email notiﬁ-

cations to the community regarding ‘

emergencies that occur on campus-
Subscribers can choose to receive
the notiﬁcations by text, Voice or
‘email, or select a combination of
the choices. The subscriber can
enter up to three different phone
numbers to receive notiﬁcations.

And though some students’ receive

the alerts later than others, Pitt of-
ﬁcials said that all alerts are sent
out at the same time. ._ ‘ »
Chief information officer. and
director of computing services

Jinx Walton said in an email that

the ENS was put in place in late
August 2007, a few months after
the fatal shooting at Virginia_Tech.
The'system operates as one of the
Universit-y’s.security tools.

“With safety as the paramount
concern, we needed a» system that
could deliver the message quickly,
accurately and to multiple commu-
nication devices,” Walton said. 5

She said that when instituting

a notiﬁcation service, Pitt was in— ’
terested in one that would send
text messages to a constituency of

students, faculty and staff.

“It had to be a system that could
accommodate a diverse group of
people who are constantly on the

go; instructors could be teaching, “

in their office or off campus, while

students could be anywhere as well,_

such as in a scheduled class, some-
where on campus or off or in their
residence,” Walton said.

The system is in place in Oak-

land and across Pitt’s four branch
campuses. *
Walton said that the Univer-

sit'y’s emergency executive,Jerome ’
Cochran, also the University’_s ex— ‘
A ecutive vice chancellor and general

counsel, is-responsible for leading
and coordinating emergency re-
sponse efforts, including making

. the decision to send out an ENS

notiﬁcation.
“Once that’ decision isﬂmade,

the message is actually launched-

through the ‘EN S system by the
University police,” she said.
Walton said that once the mes-
sage has been entered into the sys-
tem and launched, it’s delivered

‘at one time to all subscribers. Any
-inconsistencies in between the
receipt times of the messages are

normal, as delivery time varies de-

‘ pending on coverage provided. by

an individual’s phone carrier.
Karl said that she, usually re-
ceives the ENS text messages 15

.minutes later than people around

her. 5 _
. ~ “I think, ‘oh great. What if this

one was real?’ But I usually hear‘

about it from the others anyway,”

 ENS messageshelp keep campus alert.

Karl said. '
In the last month, 45930 ad-

ditional students, faculty and staff _

have subscribed to the ENS alerts,

bringing the total subscription
number to 3‘7,478’as of March 25, -

according to ﬁgures provided by
Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele.

Like Witmer and Karl, freshman
Vikram Patwardhan was instructed
to sign up for the notiﬁcations'dur—
ing freshman orientation.

“It’s actually useful, because
[Wednesday] it was like mon-

so“oning outside when the Chevron S

threat was called, so I knew not to

. walk allof the way there,” Patward-

han said. “I can see why the bomb
threats themselves are annoying,

__ but the texts are useful.”

In an email sent to students last
week, Vice Provost and Dean of Stu-
dents Kathy Humphrey asked all to
take the ENS messages seriously.

“First and foremost, I want
to encourage you to continue to
take any emergency notiﬁcation
seriously. Even though the recent
threats have been false alarms,
please continue to respect the se-

Challenge to AfforolableCare Act threatens young insured    

C Byjoe Chilson
Staﬁ" Writer

Josh Hoffman is insured, but a Supreme .

Court case being ‘argued this week could
» change that.

Hoffman is 25 years old and the Afford-A

able Care Act — the healthcare reform bill
the Obama administration signed into law
in March of 2010 — has allowed him to stay
covered by his dad’s health insurance while
he ﬁnishes law school at Pitt.

“Without this, I would not have insurance -

at the moment because it would be prohibi-
tively expensive,” Hoffman said.
_ Hoffman does not have any medical.con—
ditions that he needs the insurancefor, but
for him, knowing he has the coverage is a
weight off his mind. , . '

‘‘It’s a relief to know that if I get into an
accident, I won’t be in a lifetime of debt for
a broken foot,” he said.

This week, Hoffman and many others
turned ‘their attention to the Supreme Court,

' which concluded a three-day. reviewof the

Affordable Care Act, also known as Obama—
care, on Wednesday. The Court is expected
to make a decision byjune.

At the crux of the issue is a ‘constitutional
challenge to the law’s individual mandate,
which was discussed in the Court on Tues-

day. The mandate, if declared constitutional, _

would require most Americans to purchase
health insurance. ’

The individual mandate is the Affordable
Care A'ct’s most-controversial provision, but
some worry that if the mandate falls, the
whole law will need to be rewritten. _ '

If that happens, the law’s more popular

provisions will fail as well —— provisions‘

like the one that takes away the ability of

insurance companies to deny someone cov-

erage because_of a pre-existing condition,
or the one beneﬁcial to students, which.al—
lows people to _stay on their parents health

insurance. plan until they’re 2'6 instead of
22 years old. I

Pitt law professor Dan Herring said that
the case will most likely be decided "based
on the justices’ ideologies.

"‘There’s-a very real possibility that this
will be decided on partisan lines, and that’s
sad,” Herring said. — -

Herring, who specializes in constitution-'
al law, said that the constitutional discus-
sion would be based around the Commerce

- Clause, which details what rights-the federal .

government has to regulate commerce be-

tween the states. ’

" If the Court rulesthat the law violates the
commerce clause, then the individual man~'
date would be deemed unconstitutional.

' I Herring said the challengers will make
a broad argument that this law has allowed

_the government to overstep its bounds. The

federal government would have too much
power to regulate things usually left to the
states, and the new power to require citizens .

. to purchase something, he said.

Herring said the administration’s lawyers

_ may cite precedent, which has allowed the

federal government to regulate cross-state
commerce. V . .
Herring expects the four liberal judges to

support the law, and he said Solicitor Gen- '
— eral Donald Verrilli, arguing for the Qbama

Administration, will have to swing one of the

ﬁve conservative judges, out of the.nine total A

who sit on the Supreme Court, to support
the Affordable Care Act ‘as well.

_ In a pressrelease, Pitt law professor Ar-
thur Hellman called this case “possibly the
most important constitutional case of_our_
generation.” , ' “

He said that if the individual inandate
falls, the provisions that state that insur-
ance companies must cover those with
.pre-existing conditions and require those
companies to lower their rates would have

BONE MARROW

FROM PAGE l

I many people they are expecting to regis-
ter this year. V ’
“I thought it was so crazy that I got
gmatched,” Tamburro, who now works at
Phipps Conservatory, said. “I was shocked
when it happened, but then actually really
excited.”

To be eligible to register, a'person has -

to be between the ages of 18 and 60 and
‘in general good health. Sponberg stressed
that it is important for younger people to
register earlier because they will stay in the
registry until they are 61 years old.
NSA tabled in Towers lobby and Victoria
- School of Nursing during the week before
the drive in aneffort to educate more stu-
dents about the process. Students have a

chance to get swabbed after ﬁnding out the _

details of marrow donation.

f “We just try to inform a _lot of people,
but it’s deﬁnitely a scary thing for many,”
Payne, a senior_who has organized the event
for the past two years, said. _

Once a donor is registered with DKMS,
he or she will receive a call if a genetic match
is found with a patient who has a type of

blood disorder like leukemia or lymphoma. -

Then thedonor will go through one of two

different processes — peripheral blood_
stem “cell donation, known as PBSC, or bone ,

marrow donation. V V

. According to Sponberg, willing donors
undergo PBSC 70 percent of the time. PBSC
involves a person’s blood stream. A pump

will take out blood fro_m the_ donor’s arm, .

remove the stem cells from the blood and
-' put the remaining blood back through the

other arm. The process takes four to.six-

hours. — A . ,

A donor will go through the bone marrow
donation procedure when the patient needs
direct bone marrow cells. In this process, a
special syringe takes bone marrow from the
inside of the back -of the pelvic bone. The
donor goes under general anesthesia for

the procedure and receives pain medication _

once it’s ﬁnished, Sponberg said.

When Tamburro donated boneimarrow,

she underwent the PBSC procedure. For
four days before the process, she had to
take Neupogen, a drug that increases the

mg,

blood cell count. S
“I like_ to stress to peoplethat it wasn’t
inconvenient, and they tryto make it very

\ easy for you,” Tamburro said. “I was not that

much of a fan of shots beforethis process,

‘ but I’ got used to it.”

Because pain is a major factor in many
people’s decision to donate bone marrow,

the Nursing Student Association is placing .

an extra emphasis on informing potential

donors about every detail of the process. .

This includes providing details about what
happens if they are accepted as a suitable

donor, such‘ as the different procedures they

will have to undergo and the pain that might .

go along with it. -

“It’s really sad when people get called
to donate, and they back out on the dona-
tion,” Pretsch, a junior and president of

,NSA, said. . l .

Tamburro said her experience donat-
ing the bone marrow was worthwhile. The
donation was anonymous, but she was al-

lowed to know the patient’s age and the type

of cancer he was diagnosed with, although
She wasn’t allowed to reveal any information
about herself. After six months, the patient
contacted Tamburro to let her know that he
was doing well. In another six months, the
two. can meet if they choose to do so.
“If=you have a chance to help someone,
a little discomfort is not that big a deal,”
she said. ’ -1 . V

Hellman added that the provision that
allows young people to stay on their par-
ents’ health plans might be in danger as
well because it costs insurance companies
more money to insure more people on the
same plan, rather than people purchasing
separate plans.

Hellman also thought that the case was

tions. , .

“I wouldn’t bet money on either side right
now. It’s pretty close,” Herring said.

The lawyers for both sides went home on
Wednesday, but it could be months before
the court comes ‘to a decision. The policy
of the Supreme Court is to decide all cases

that the Court will take until the term ends

I walked into our kitchen where

There was only one problem.

While high—school Andrew would.

Andrew was downright upset.
Thanks for the well Wishes, Mom,

‘but you don’t know me at all!

water, college kids have equally
unique attributes.

no mistake: I love watching TV.
Whether it’s “Mad Men,” “Break—

Drinking coffee. Come the

need coffee? Yet in every class, at

‘ least a third of the students have a

tournament most Panthers fans
had ‘never heard of before this
season: the College Basketball
Invitational.

Less than a month ago, on

what is often referred to as Se-‘

lection Sunday, Pitt’s fate was

uncertain. Unsurprisingly, Pitt’s '

disappointing 17-16 record elimi-
nated the team from NCAA Tour-
nament at-large consideration,
but afterthe National Invitation
Tournament also declined, to send
Pitt an invitation, it appeared the
Panthers’ season was over.
Then word began circulating
that Pitt had agreed to compete
in the newer, much less presti-
giouslCBI tournament. The news
was met with a common reaction:

Initially, many fans ques-

the CBI, but the last two weeks

have proven to be a positive -

learning experience for coaches,
players and even fans who didn’t
know that tournaments beyond
the NCAA and NIT existed. -
From a purely game-oriented
perspective, the CBI’s brief four-
year history validates the idea
that postseason tournaments

of any kind help collegiate pro—‘

tournament experience and extra

In 2010, few paid attention

FEATURE,

Club sport athletes find

  success, friendship

By R] Sepich
_ Staff Writer

It’s almost midnight on a Tues-
day evening, and Mark Cunliffe
is drenched in sweat and covered

in dirt standing in front of Clapp _

Hall. _

_As the Pitt sophomore unloads
his baseball gear from his team-
mate’s car to haul it back to his
apartment,’ he knows that the last
three hours of practice‘ with the
Pitt club baseball team could have
been time spent studying or catch-
ing up on sleep.

But Cunliffe says not once has
he regretted his decision to live
the time-con-

only makes it better.”
oFor some athletes who easily
could have played college sports

"at the NCAA Division II or Division

III levels, focusing ‘on academics
while still having the ability to stay
competitive with club sports led to
their decision to attend Pitt instead
of a smaller university.

Senior Ashley Pallone, presi-
dent of Pitt club softball, said all
of the athletes on her team love
playing the game, but they real-
ize their primary focus should be

, academics.

“We have some girls who want
to bedoctors or engineers, so aca-
demics obviously come ﬁrst,” Pal-
lone said. “They probably could

night lifestyle

“That’s the es-
sence of club

week including practices, fundrais-
ingand games —‘ is shared by the

;hundreds of Pitt students currently

participating in almost 30 club
sports at the University, ranging
from popular games like soccer
and lacrosse to lesser -known ac-
tivities like equestrian competi-

‘ tions and fencing.

The‘ reasons why students
decide to join club sports teams
vary. I

Men’s club rugby player Ben
Paul said he believes that the so-
cial aspects of club sports help in
his team’s ability to attract both
experienced and inexperienced
athletes. . "

“You can get out there, have
some fun and meet new people,”
Paul said. ‘joining a club sport is
a great way to make friends, and
staying competitive while playing
a fun, fast-paced game like rugby

he said. “When I heard about club
sports here, having the opportuni-
ty to continue playing baseball was
something-I couldn’t pass up.”

Some athletes ﬁnd that the busy
lifestyle of cl-ub sports actually
helps with academics by forcing
them to avoid procrastinating with
schoolwork.

Sophomore Geoff Landry, a sec-
ond-year member of Pitt’s Division
II.club hockey program, believes
his chaotic hockey schedule has
helped him become more orga-
nized. ' _

“Playing hockey forces me to
get my schoolwork done ahead of
time rather than putting it off for
later, because I know that there
is nop‘later’ to put it off to if I ever

_ want to get to bed at a reasonable
time,” Landry said.

Fellow sophomore Lamar Patterson

getting their conﬁdence right now and
that’s going to be perfect going into next

Following a dramatic victory over
Washington State on Wednesday that
forced tonight’s decisive game three, Pitt
senior forward Nasir Robinson said the
Panthers want to be one of the few teams
in the country fortunate enough to close
the season out with a victory.

“We wanted to play in this,” he said.
“We could’ve easily backed out of this
tournament, but it was the decision of
all of the players and coaches to play and
now we want to ﬁnish this out.”

Regardless ofwhether Pitt wins or
loses tonight, the players and coaches
deserve an immense amount of credit for
not giving up on this season when so many
others did. ' .

That refuse-to-quit attitude might pay
huge dividends in the near future. Just

in Harmarville, which is about a 30-minute
drive north from Pitt’s campus.

n Both club hockey teams competed into
the later rounds offlleir. conference tourna-
ments this past season, and they aren’t the
only Pitt club teamswho contend for both
conferenceand naftiional ‘championships.

The men’s'ultin1ﬁte frisbeé team entered
the national tournafnent last spring as the
No. 1 overall seed before beingupset in the
quarterﬁnals. Currently, the team is ranked

in the top ﬁve and is preparing to make a
run at a national championship later this
spring.

The Pitt roller hockey team advanced to
the Elite Eight of its national tournament,
and the women’s rugby team won the 2011
Allegheny Rugby Union Championship.

Several other teams also rank in the na-
tional top 25, including baseball, men’s vol-
leyball, men’s lacrosse and even the Harry
Potter-based Quidditch team. ,

With so many students involved in Pitt
club spbrts, there’s heavy competition for
facilities amongst the various teams.

Some of the teams have taken advantage
of the nice weather by practicing on the Ca-
thedral of Learning lawn in allotted times,

but Bryan Peck, a sophomore midﬁelder
from the men’s lacrosse club, said not every
team gets that lucky.

g“We got stuck with really late practices
up at the Cost Center on weeknights,” he

. said, “But you’ve got to take what you can

because the facilities and practice times are
extremely limited.’’ .

For Landry, the frustrations created by
ﬁghting for facilities and dealing with incon-
venient practice times pales in comparison
to the relationships he has built with his
hockey teammates.

“The bonds and friendships made are
ones that become life—lasting,” he said. “We
