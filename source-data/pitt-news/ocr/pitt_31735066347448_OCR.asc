Langley Blast

\Old Gas Supply Line Blame

BY MREA CSORBA

A structurally damaged four-inch
natural gas line near Langley Hall
indicates a gas- leak may have
caused last week's explosion,
Robert Coll, Superintendent of City
Police, said Monday after a
meeting of Pitt and city officials
investigating the blast.

Coll reiterated a prepared
statement read by Dr; Bernard
Kobosky, Vice Chancellor for
Public Affairs, which opened the
press conference. saying the
possibility of a bomb has been
ruled out. ‘

He also said preliminary inves-

- tigations found no evidence that

any chemicals used in academic or
research activities could have
caused an explosion of this extent.

Coll said a study of blast and
debris patterns indicate the explo-
sion probably oecured inthe 1,500
cubic foot crawl space under the
Langley Hall auditorium wing.
“Structural damage has been
found in a four-inch main about 200
feet from Langley Hall.” It was an
old line which possibly supplied
area houses at one time, and still
had gas in it.

“Itwas not connected to Langley
Hall, but a leak in it could have
seeped through the ground and up
the gravel ﬁll underneath thelﬂoor
of the labs," Coll said.

Pitt is heated by hot-water heat,
Coll said, and the University had
not switched to old pipes or other
heat sources during the frigid
weather last week.

Kobosky denied the construction
underway in Crawford‘Hall at the
time of the explosion had any
connection with the blast and said
the chemicals in the electron
microscope labs had been kept in

 

safe containersto insure safety.‘ No
structural safety precautions had
been included in the construction of
the lecture halls to shield students
against the dangers of a freak lab
accident, he said.

“As far as I know there is no way
to safeguard a building from a

blast,” Kobosky said.

County Coroner Cyril H. Wecht,
who also was present at the
meeting, said lab tests revealed
Carleen Curry, 35, the secretary
killed in the blast, had traces of
methane, a component of natural
gas, in her system. “She may have
inhaled it before the explosion," he
said. Wecht said people who were
near the scene of the explosionare
being tested for chemical traces.

 

Voter Participation

BY DAN ROSENTHAL

More than half of Pitt’s
undergraduates will either not be
voting or are undecided about
voting in today’s Student Govern-
ment election, according to a recent
Pitt News survey.

One hundred undergraduates
responded to the question, ‘ ‘Do you
intend to vote in the upcoming
Student Government election?"

Most students who said they
wouldn’t be voting said they didn’t
believe they knew the candidates
well enough.

Hector Garcia, a freshman, said,
“The candidates haven’t really
reached me. I recognize most of

~ their faces from their posters, but I

don’t know what they stand for.”

Greg Magreni, a senior, said
dissatisfaction with Student Gov-
ernment in the past is his main
reason for not voting.

“I haven’t seen Student Govern-
ment do anything to motivate me
sufficiently to research any of the
candidates,” he said.

One sophomore who requested
her name be withheld typified the
view of many commuters. She said
time didn’t permit her involvement
in any extracurricular activities and
that Student Government had little
else to offer commuters. She said
her education was her main reason
for being at Pitt. *

Still, others wanted their voice
heard in the upcoming election.

A freshman who also requested

of Clapp Hall) looking for clues to the cause of the

If the culprit was natural gas,
Coll said, the explosion could have
been ignited by almost anything.
“Gas vapors are like gasoline
fumes—-—anything could spark it,”
Coll said. “Any kind of friction,
heat or light could have sparked the

blast.” ..

Coll said Curry was talking on
the phone to her family at the time
of the explosion, and that she could
have, been smoking. ’ Cigarette
butts were found on the ﬂoor of th

Plans for a memorial fund to
honor Patricia Hostetler and
Carleen Curry, the two women
killed in the Langley Hall explosion
last week, were finalized
yesterday.

The funds will be used to
purchase books in Hostetler and
Curry’s names, according to a
spokesman coordinating the fund
drive. The books will be placed on
a special shelf in one of the
University’s libraries, possibly
Langley Hall, and a special plaque
bearing the women's names will be
mounted on the shelf, he said.

“We would like to .provide a
channel for the University Com-
munity to express its grief in a
constructive manner so that maybe
the deaths of Patricia Hostetler and
Carleen Curry will not seem so
senseless," the spokesman said.

two days of deliberation that
explored several ideas, such as
commemorative plaques, scholar-

organizations,” he said.

“The book fund was chosen
because it will provide students

Women: Do You Know Your Lawful Rights?

BY BETSY NORMAN

Prominent feminists and pro-
ponents of the women's rights
movement claim one large stum-
bling block to their success is the
lack of public awareness about the
rights and laws affecting women.

One organization seeking to
eliminate this lack of awareness is
the Women’s Rights Committee of
the American Civil Liberties Union
of Pennsylvania (ACLU), which has
recently published a pamphlet
entitled Women and the Law in
Pennsylvania.

“Unawareness is the biggest
stumbling block for women across
the nation. It is crucial that
everyone become aware of his or her
rights as a person,” Ellen Doyle,
executive director of the South-
western Pa. ACLU, said.

The pamphlet is intended to
provide basic information about
“state and federal laws that affect
the lives of women in Pennsyl-
vania,” the preface states...

V reproductive freedom,

“Although women are still
disadvantaged under the law, the
laws in Pennsylvania are probably
better than in any other state.
Women are unaware of the rights
some newer laws have given them.
Women just don’t know and are
hungry for information,” attorney
Pat Miller, a member of the
Women’s Rights Committee and
the executive board of the
Southwestern Pa. ACLU explained
“Unless you bring them informa-
tion on the rights they have, the
women will not exercise these rights
and the rights will become
useless.” If
L The pamphlet deals with eight
very broad sections: employment,
marriage
and its consequences, separation

and divorce, finances, public"

assistance, education and criminal
law.

The section on employment deals
with subjects ranging from hiring
and firing pratices of employers to
maternity rights. For example, it

V A SG Board Names

Allocations Members

BY THERESA MULAC

Controversy greeted the
announcement of the newly
appointed Allocations Committee
at Monday night’s Student Govern-
ment Board meeting.

SGB member‘ Gary Tweed

- objected to the Board's selection of

next year’s committee. “The
newly elected board should have
the chance to appoint that
committee and also has that
priority,” he said.

SGB president Barry Weisband
explained this year’s board has the
power to appoint next year’s
committee. “Considering the
business the committee deals with
and the experience of this year’s
Board, I feel we are justified in
appointing the committee,” he
said.

Traditionally, the newly elected
SGB appoints the incoming Alloca-
tions Committee and representa-
tives to other committees.

The SGB liason for the current
Allocations Committee, Carol
Thomas, ‘explained the interviews

to select the committee were based‘

on availability, ability to analyze
information, ability to apply guid-
ance‘ and previous experience.

Those appointed to the com-
mittee are: Renee Fagnani (SGB
liason), David Hesidence, David
Lowe, Scott Brown, Joseph
Mclntee, George Nagle, Bernard
Beattie and Jeff Barent. Alternates
selected are Joe Nychay, Tim
Wolcott and Joel Cohen.

In other ‘SGB action, the Board
approved the revised “Policies and
Procedures” for allocations of
activities fee monies to student
organizations. The SGB passed all

the“; revisions with the: exceptionfl0,f;;

one provision prohibiting the
funding of major concerts.

According to Allocations Com-
mittee member Josh Baylson, the
provision will go back to committee

for further discussion and the
board will meet again to discuss the
issue.

Other revisions approved state:
campus political and religious
organizations may only be funded
by the activities fee if they present
their views in an open forum;
charities will not be eligible for
funding and telephones will not be
funded unless a clear need is
demonstrated.

explains certain federal and state
regulations “require that preg-
nancy be treated like any other
temporary disability. Provisions for
sick leave and/ or disability leave an
employer makes must be available
on the same terms for disability
caused by pregnancy and child-
birth.”

Laws concerning contraception,
abortion and sterilization are
explained in the section dealing
with reproductive freedom. It
explains the 1973 U.S. Supreme
Court decision that a “state cannot’
restrict or prohibit abortions
performed during the first trimester
of pregnancy.”

The section on marriage concerns
names, property, support, respon-
sibility of children and widowhood.
It explains that a man in
Pennsylvania “has a legal obliga-
tion to support his wife by providing
her with basic necessities,” and
that “parents are responsible for
the support of their children to the
age of 18.” It goes on to say the
Pennsylvania ERA has ended the
presumption that “the father has
the primary responsibility for the
ﬁnancial support of his childen,”
but rather that “responsbility is
divided equally between the
parents according to their ability to
pay.”

Annulment, separation, divorce,
alimony and child custody are the
main subjects under the heading of
separation and divorce. This
section explains that Pennsylvania
has no provision for “no-fault”
divorce, but that divorce is viewed
as an “adversary proceeding in
which’ one spouce, the plaintiff,
brings charges against the other,
the defendant.” It lists the

acceptable grounds for divorce in
Pennsylvania including desertion,
adultery, bigamy, cruel and bar-
barous treatment, conviction of a
felony and permanent insanity.

In reference to alimony, the
pamphlet states Pennsylvania has
no provision for alimony, that
“there is no right to alimony
following a divorce.”

The section on education deals
with public school admission,
access to courses, counseling,
athletics and pregnancy as well as
higher education. The pamphlet
explains Title IX, effective since
1975, which prohibits sexual
discrimination in any educational
program or activity receiving
federal assistance.

Rape and -battered wives are the
two topics of explanation in the
criminal law section of the
pamphlet. This section explains “a
prompt report to the police is
important for successful prosecu-
tion of a rapist. Evidence of the use

of force and penetration are
valuable in establishing a case of
rape, and the victim should not
clean up, bathe, or change clothing
before talking to the police.”

One of the most practical sections
of the pamphlet is a list of agencies
that provide further information
and assistance. This list is not
conﬁned to the tri-state area, but is
state-wide. It lists such agencies as
the rape crisis centers, Planned
Parent Associations, legal aid
agencies, and ACLU offices.

The pamphlet is available from
ACLU of Pennsylvania, Inc., 237
Oakland Ave., Pgh, 15213, for $1.

BY GARY GOVERT

This week’s Student Government
Board (SGB) election presents Pitt
students with the opportunity to
vote on two proposals to restructure
student government. The.
referenda, if approved, will provide
for the "establishment of six
vice-presidential positions (in lieu
of the present Board) and will create
an assembly composed of one
representative from each officially
recognized student organization.
The Assembly will act in an advisory
capacity, with each organization
responsible for sending its own-
delegate.

Though at first glance the.
restructuring proposals look like
just another bureaucratic maneu-
ver aimed at revitalizing _ a
perennially ineffectual Board, it
could be, in fact, a giant step
toward a more representative
student government.

The proposals’ primary value lies
in its provision for" a student
assembly. Creation of an assembly
wherein different campus organi-
zations have a voice would change
student government from an
essentially majority rule situation
to one that is more pluralistic.
Pluralism recognizes and provides
room for perspectives other than
the majority’s. It allows for greater
inﬂuence by these minority per-
spectives on the decision making
process than is possible in a strictly

Prof Charges Pitt Harassment

I read your article of January 17,
1977, in the Pitt News concerning
the Congressional scrutiny of Pitt’s
hiring and ﬁring practices. Since
the statements by University

officials have been made and

quoted with respect to matters

about which I have direct know-
ledge and which are inaccurate,
erroneous, and damaging, I believe
you will welcome receiving the
attached documents of EEOC and
the Court and references to facts in
the situation which will offer a more
correct perspective and which you

- may wish to pursue for the

understanding of truth.

I was granted permanent tenure
by the University of Pittsburgh in
1969 following the University of
Pittsburgh standard evaluation
procedures. The summary letter to
Chancellor Posvar supporting and
recommending this award specified
that I had ‘ ‘contributed signiﬁcantly
to the teaching and research
program of the school.” Early in
l972, I was awarded, a_more. than

$120,000 Federal research grant by
the National Institutes of Health
based on their estimate of my
qualiﬁcations by peer review and
the merits of my preliminary
research work on Marihuana.
Henceforth, each year at the
International Congress of Pharma-
cology I have presented t_he'results
of research on this grant. Present
have been leading scientists of NIH
as well as others in the field and my
work has been well received. My
qualiﬁcations and work at this

University have already been fully
evaluated and this is not the issue.
What is at issue is my public and
open articulation in February, 1972,
‘and later of discriminatory hiring
practices at this Universityand its
lack of afﬁrmative equal employ-
ment opportunity action and
subsequent acts of harassment and
retaliation by the University

‘officials against me. From the

inception of my federal grant at the
time of my public utterances, I have

democratic system. Pluralistic
representation in an assembly
would help check the growth of
monolithic power structures.

The fundamental problem with
democratically‘ determined repre-
sentation is its “excommunicative’ ’
quality. Any person or group not in
the majority is effectively eliminat-
ed from the decision making
process—-in other words, excom-
municated. Representation is not
even proportional to the amount of
votes received by respective
candidates, let alone reflective of a
desire to treat all perspectives
equally—it is, instead, an all-or-
nothing situation. Minorities are
left with neither voice not vote.
This structural disadvantage is
sometimes overcome as aresult of
demographic factors or apathy on
the part of the majority, so
occasionally a minority will become
a majority at the ballot box, but for
this to be the only road to
representation seems hardly fair.

Democracy’s downfall comes
when the majority unjustly imposes
its will upon the unrepresented
minority. A “monolithic power
structure” evolves as the shape of
the majority juggernaut; one
interest is represented, one inter-
est is served. With no vote--and
therefore no power——minority
groups can ‘only plead from the
sidelines for alternatives and hope
they will be heard by - some
majoritarian who is not preoccup-
ied with his or her own vested
interests.

Though modern secular universi-
ties usually fancy themselves
pluralistic, Pitt, for one, certainly is
not. The expressions of the
monolith are easily recognizable
here. Secular humanism is the
dominant religious perspective at
Pitt and has excommunicated all
others, especially fromthe academ-
ic scene——just ask any Christian,

_ Jew, or Muslim who has tried to

argue points in class from
scriptural principle rather than
from a secular perspective of
rationalistic autonomy and pragma-
tism.

The majority racial perspective
at Pitt is white——blacks have not had

an easy time getting programs
geared to their needs, and it has
often been difﬁcult to keep those
programs alive when they became
inconvenient for the university.

Pitt’s economic outlook is capitalis-
tic—-university business and curri-

cular policy both reflect this
perspective, much to the consterna-
tion of reform-minded people.

The list could continue.

Occasionally, tokens of appease- 6

ment are offered to minority groups
to make them feel better. Tokens.
The creation of g a pluralistic
student government Assembly
would afford minority interests a
voice and a vote. Policy would still
be made democratically, but, for
the first time, alternative perspec-
tives would be structurally included
in the decision ‘making process.
Previously excommunicated groups
would be acknowledged co-equals
with the majority, and could begin
moving the university in the
direction of real responsiveness to
the community's diverse needs.

Of course, the proposed assemb- ‘
lyi is not about to topple the ,

monolith. The student govern-
ment's inﬂuence on university
policy is debatable, as is the
potential inﬂuence of an “advis-
cry" assembly. The referendum is
not clear on exactly which
organizations merit membership in
the assembly-—improper criteria
could result in unmanageability or
more excommunication. In fact,
creation of an assembly would
probably open a Pandora's box of
new problems. Even so, a step
toward a more representative
system ‘of student government is a
step in the right direction; we have
to be willing to pay the price.

Paying the price does not only
mean ironing out the bureaucratic
bugs. It also means. as a recent
Pitt News editorial suggested: that
students must be willing to provide
the input needed to make the SGB
effective. If students are not
willing to make that effort. no form
of government will work—we might

just as well leave our fate inthe
hands of the monolith.

M.L. King
Did Much d
To Get Day

I don’t pretend to know why the
administration recognises Martin
Luther King’s birthday by giving
us a school holiday. Perhaps it is
due to a “terminal case of ‘radical
chic”’ or the appeasement of a
“small but vocal minority.” As a
member of a majority that has been
given minority status for years, I
know that you had better be
“vocal,” persistent and aggressive
if you are ever going to improve
your condition. In any case, I
address this letter to Dan
Mulholland’s suggestion that the
day has little signiﬁcance to those
of us who aren’t black.

While sitting down to

breakfast on Saturday morning,

with my six-year-old niece Kathy
and sister’. Marilyn, Kathy men-
tioned that her teacher had told her
that Saturday was an important
person’s birthday. Marilyn asked
her, “Who’s birthday is it?”
Kathy said, “Martin Luther
King’s.” Marilyn asked her if her
teacher had told her who Martin
Luther King was and what he did.
Kathy said, “Yeah,” but looked
kind of puzzled as if she didn’t
really understand what her teacher
had said. So Marilyn explained to
her, “Martin Luther King was a
black man. You know that black
people have dark skins. Well, lots
of times people treated them very
mean just because their skins were
black. A long time ago, about a 100
years ago, they had to work on
The
people who owned the farms owned
them and they could be bought and
sold. They weren’t allowed to go to

school and learn to read. That was’

a crime. And sometimes they were
killed because they were black.

Well things got a little better for I

them after a war called the Civil
War was fought. But even until a
few years ago they weren’t allowed
to eat in certain restaurants,
couldn't use the same bathrooms

that white people used and they

would have to sit in the backs of
buses. Well, Martin Luther King

helped to make some things better v

for them and some people think
that he was killed because of what
he tried to do.”
simply so a child mightlunder-
stand, I don’t think this is
something we can afford to forget.

Any group of people and even
individuals can be treated in the
same way and this must be
prevented.

Obviously a lot of 'criticism has
been made about the way Martin
Luther King lived his life. But if
the man did nothing else he
brought to attention the fact that
blacks were not socially, econom-
ically and legally equal to whites.
Perhaps his efforts for blacks
contributed to form the idea that
dissent wasn't necessarily treason.
Which in turn raised issues to other
people's conscious such as:
women’s rights, equal rights for
Chicanos and the Vietnam War.

The author mentions that Martin
Luther King’s efforts didn't have
comparable magnitude to those of
the “Founding Fathers." Indeed,
weren’t his efforts made necessary
because the “Founding Fathers"
did not recognize blacks as being
equal to whites. .

All this being said, does the
reader conclude that I'm a
bleeding-heart liberal? Maybe I
am. But then again, the heart
tends to bleed when you know and
realize that many people do not
consider you and certain of your

fellows to be their equal.

research activity, delay in recruit-
ment, interference with my pur-

respect to the genuineness of my
signature, etc. I have been denied

_For sometime I tried to resolve
these matters within the University,
with Universitv ofﬁcials through the
existing internal channels. How-
ever, the University officials were
not responsive to my attempts to
resolve and correct this situation
internally in spite of findings of the

State Tenure and Academic Free-
dom Committee ﬁnding which was
supportive of my position. When
they escalated retaliation and
harassment, therefore, I filed
charges of discrimination and
retaliation with the Federal Equal
Employment Opportunity Commis-
sion in December 1974. They also
conﬁrmed my allegations of dis-
crimination and retaliation.

On November 21, 1975 a “Right
To Sue Letter” was issued me by
EEOC and on December 15, 1975 I
ﬁled suit in Federal Court. This suit

included Mr. Nathan Stark as*a

defendant and it is a fact that a U.S.
marshall delivered the suit to Mr.

A Stark’s home. Mr. Stark is one of
the respondents in the EEOC
charges & determination.

The University has pressed me to
withdraw my EEOC charges. I have
refused because the University has
continued and intensiﬁed harrass-
ment. They have additionally asked
me to hold in abeyance other actions
in this matter while they develop the
ploy that somehow they will work
matters out internally. Meanwhile,
however, in fact the University has
continued to villify and slander my
reputation both within and beyond

no good faith efforts to reestablish

_ BY HELEN HAKY

Liberty Avenue. It’s the home
of entertainment like “Fiﬁ Fondue
and Her Entire Revue,” triple
X—rated movies, and adult book
stores. So you probably think only
old men and curious teenagers
throng to these places where
semi—nudity and sexuality abound.

Wrong. At least one place on
Liberty Avenue, Stage 966, caters
to females by featuring male
dancers. According to one
advertisement, there are “disco
girls and disco boys” billed as,
“Mel’s Angles—Devils.” On
Thursdays, the ad continues, “No
men wanted ‘til after 10 p.m.” _

Most streets in downtown
Pittsburgh are deserted by that
time, during the work week.
However, life on Liberty Avenue
seems to be just beginning.
Blinking lights and enticing signs
encourage customers to stop in for
an adult movie or live show.

When I stepped into the
darkened Stage 966, I saw about 20
women following every movement
of the dancer on stage. He gyrated
andjiggled each part of his "body to
a jukebox recording by K.C. and
the Sunshine Band.

While also watching the perfor-
mance, I walked past the bar and
the six-by-six foot stage to the back
of the room and one of the few
unoccupied tables, '

The table, cluttered with empty
beer cans and glasses, was lit by
one candle in a yellow glass
container. Other tables had red
candles that matched the red vinyl
backing on the booth seats. Worn ‘
carpeting and faded walls complet-
ed the decor where I sat.

Any empty seats around me

were ﬁlled by the time the dancer

ﬁnished his routine. He wiggled

D his way off stage to be replaced by

another male and another juke—box v
song.

In a minute, the first dancer
headed back to my booth and,Aa
little out of breath, introduced
himself as J.R. Besides a hand‘
towel slung over his bare should-
ers, .I.R. wore a shiny, white-and-
silver sequined G-string. The
strategically placed triangle of
cloth left very little to the
imagination.

When his shimmering G-string is
replaced by Levi’s and his bare
chest and feet covered~with an
Indian cloth shirt and Earth shoes,
J .R. becomes a senior psychology
major at Duquesne University.‘ _‘_His
curly hair, ﬂuffed-out afro style,
and a light brown mustache ﬁnish
the college-student image.

“Last term I was ﬂat broke and
was looking for something that I
liked to do and could get paid for,”
J.R. said when explaining how he
started as a dancer. “I’ve always
loved to dance, and since the’ waiter

here is my roommate, I thought I’d
audition.” After his third audition,
Stage 966 needed a dancer and J.R.
was hired. ' .

For a little over a year, J.R. has
been dancing three nights a week
from 7:30 p.m. until 2 a.m. The
$40 a night makes it worthwhile,
even when J.R. has to get up at
seven the next morning for classes.
However, J .R. said he would still
dance “for fun, even if I didn’t
need the money.” ‘

The pay’, though, helps his
stepfather accept the situation.
“He thinks it’s alright since _I’m
paying my way through school,”
J.R. explained. But his mother

thinks it’s “neat,” J.R. said,
“because she’s young and part of
the jet-set.”

J .R. sipped his Coke some more
and watched the other dancer on
stage. Mirrored squares above the

FEATURE

stage reflect body movements as
well as the blinking lights. To the
left of the stage, a narrow platform
holds a dark-haired disc jockey
wearing a golden G-string.

The DJ played a popular disco 6

song and we watched the dancer
shake his way down the few steps
from the stage and move out into
the audience. He slithered over to
a corner table and encouraged a
young woman to come up on stage
with him through his gestures and
body movements. When she

hesitated, he picked her up and

carried her.

She still hesitated to dance while
on stage, but the dancer circled her
while throwing out his hips and
chest. When she began some
dancing, the audience cheered and
clapped until the ‘end of the music.
After that ﬁrst female on stage,
other women took the initiative and

as phot
danced —over——-sometimes moving
just a little and sometimes
synchronizing their movements
with their partner. ' —

J .R. said that he, like the other
dancer, enjoys when women
vo1untarily.jump up on stage- And

when he’s not dancing with women

on the stage or in the aisles, he
enjoys mingling at the tables.--»

J .R. knows from experience that
women have become less inhibited;
he’s received many propositions
from his female admirers. But J .R.
doesn’tlike being thought of as a
sex object. “Many women brand

me as ‘an easy pushover’ because .

of what Ido. And I don’t like being
pursued all the time, I would rather
do the pursuing,” J.R.- Said.

By this time, the other dancer,

wearing a ﬂuorescent green G-
string, had ﬁnished his four dance
numbers. He came over and said

From the Inside

BY BARB THOMAS

“I don’t like to hear about it. I
don’t like to talk about it, it doesn’t
seem right because others can tell
he story better,” said Lon Voisey, a
Pitt senior who was injured in the
Langley blast last Thursday.

“The teacher, Mrs. Vergona, was
in the middle of a sentence and all of
the sudden all hell broke loose.
Things were falling all over the
room. My first reaction was that it
was an earthquake,” he said.
adding that the force of the
explosion threw everyone forward-

Lon said the class made a
surprisingly orderly rush to the
emergency exit. “People were

crying but a few guys up front were
really calm. They stood by the door
and told everyone that the worst
was over. Iknew it was bad-——but I
didn’t realize how bad until I
turned around and looked through
the hole in the back of the room and
saw the sky."

Right after the blast a cloud of gas
fell over the room. Lon said he was
sure the gas was poisonous. He said
that was the first time he thought he
wouldn’t make it outside alive.

“I didn’t feel the cut on the back
of my head until, on the way out,
someone told me I was bleeding. I
forgot about the cut because it
wasn’t important,” Lon said. He

The Langley Blast

then went back into the room to get

his coat. “That was a dumb move,"

he admitted, “but I was cold.”

Two friends, Brian and Joe, were
in the class with Lon at the time.
“Joe was next to me in the blast.
We couldn’t ﬁnd Brian. The gas was
too strong to go back into the
room,” he said. “Brian was sitting
down the street with someone else's
coat on. Everyone was looking for
their friends. Someone came up to
me and said, ‘You’re alive-—that’s
one more.’ ”

Lon said he then walked to
Presbyterian University Hospital,
but, because they were so busy,
they wheeled him over to Eye and

Ear, where he was treated and
released. His head injury was better
by Sunday, he said.

“That night the newspaper from
home, McKees Rocks, called the
next day and I was on the front
page. My mother called and we had
a laugh about the dramatization.
I’m gladl can laugh about it now.”

For Lon, the incident is as over as
it will ever be. Already, the
nightmares of the blast are
recurring. “But,” Lon said, “that’s
to be expected.”

His classes are back to normal,
“except for one teacher who has
become really strict about ‘non-

 

he was called “Shimmy Jimmy” by
the girls there. What an
appropriate name.

Despite women calling him
“Shimmy Jimmy”, he never has
felt like a sex object. “What I'm
doing is an art. And I.separate
work from any relationships,
keeping business away from play,”
Jimmy said.

Although his business now is
dancing, Jimmy formerly was in
the Marine Corps. How does, an
ex—Marine get a job “disco”
dancing? “I was here one night
and decided I could do a better job
of dancing. So I auditioned and
was hired the same night,” Jimmy
said. ,“And I love it here,” he
added. J ,

Jimmy, blonde and a little older
than J.R., also works three nights a
week. He described his routine'by
saying, “Whatever's in your head
at the time is how you dance.” But

none of the dancers ever wear less
than a G-string, no matter what
may be in their heads. up

Why do women in the audience
enjoy males dancing in semi-nud-
ity? The women, ranging in age
from near 21 (the required age for
admittance) to the mid-forties,
don’t speciﬁcally call themselves
“liberated," but believe they
should be able to watch male
dancers if men can enjoy female
dancers. A V

Sharon, a 30-year-old who works
and has a son, best expressed how
most women felt. “It’s fantastic
that there arenowigo-go boys. «And
it’s about time!” Sharon said.
“My husband knows I enjoy male
dancers, although Ithink most men
are puritanical about men danc-

I ing," Sharon continued.

Joan, a 21-year-old housewife,
knew her husband wouldn’t under-
stand. “My old man would kill me
if he knewl was here,” she said.
Especially if he had seen Jimmy
carry her up on stage to dance. But
she enjoyed herself.

“At ﬁrst I was a nervous wreck
up on stage because it was my ﬁrst
time here. Then the audience gave
me confidence,” Joan said.‘ She
added that even though her
curiosity had been satisﬁed, she
loved the show and will be back.

JoAnne, an older woman sitting
in a corner booth with her
daughter, has been to Stage 966
four times and will be back again.
“I know all my friends that haven’t
been here would enjoy the show if‘
they saw the dancing,” JoAnne
said, as she alternated between
smoking a cigarette and clapping.-

All the women showed their
enthusiasm by clapping or shaking
beer cans, ﬁlled with aquarium
gravel, which had been supplied by
the management. The cans,
wrapped in white paper, advertised
Stage 966 and the _“go-go”
dancers. According to J.R. the
noise from the cans“ lets the
audience participate in the act and
show their pleasure.

From the sound of all those
shaking cans, the women liked
what they saw.

Did I like the show? I think I’ll
go back there before I make up my
mind...

  Not the Man; But His Art A

BY MREA CSORBA

Granted, artist Virgil Cantini
has a robust personality, but that
shouldn’t overshadow the impact of
his artwork. Articles galore have
been written about this artist and
studio arts department chairman.
Mostoften, the reviewer becomes
overwhelmed by the challenge of
_the Cantini personality and ends up
reviewing the man at the expense
of his art.
But the real issue is his art.

. Whether he is brusque with his

secretaries, or why he refuses art
students entrance to upper-level
courses is, excuse me, irrelevant to
the judgement of his work.

Cantini’s personality should enter
into this question only in the

the piece’s elements into unity and
creates pitched visual intensity.

Perhaps Cantini was unsure of .
his ability to simulate movement by
himself without the aid of machines
but the piece is installed in the
lobby with a motor enclosed in its
base, evidently to rotate it.

True, I have not seen it in motion
(Point Park doesn’t turn on the
motor), but it’s not needed. The
band that ropes around his
composition suggests the move-
ment perfectly. ,

Dynamism is conveyed in Can-
tini’s late ’60s “Man” sculpture,
which stretches over the , Fifth
Avenue side wall of Pitt’s Graduate
Public Health Building. A bronze
skeletal ﬁgure, a number of
varying-sized scales and three

realization that without that

. unreﬁnement of his character, his

works would not be as vitally
dynamic.

For Cantini works are dynamic.
That quality can be recognized as
his trademark throughout m_ost of
his art. Whether he’s sculpting in

.steel, bronze or alluminum, or

working on his enamel~ panels
dusted with brilliant glass-powder
color, his works are energized,
sometimes to a frenzy.

An early ’60’s sculpture in front
of David Lawrence Hall is perhaps
his most static, and therefore the
least interesting, of his pieces
prominently displayed around the
city. It consists of four large steel
triangles, three of which touch

ground at the tip of their smallest‘

angle, as sometimes spaceships are
pictured to do. These three join
together at_ the seams to support
the fourth triangle between them,
about three feet in the air. This top
component’s solid plane surface is
interrupted near the top with a hole
tlL§a.t contains a glass rock

suspended by bronze claws. Nice, I

but that’s about it.

We see the beginnings of
movement in the sculpture situated
in the Point Park College lobby.
This, a child of the sixties too,
consists of three tall, thin, standing
bars that, in the context of the
whole work, suggest the semblance
of a cage. A ﬁgure is attached
outside the circle created by the
bars in a pose that suggests it has
just taken wings from its enslaving

quarters. The ﬁgure looks a little 

too like Cupid in its size and pose
which is bothersome to the viewer.

But the work’s saving grace is the
steel band that lassoes around the
bars and reaches the ﬁgure in an
energized swing. This band collars

   

thinly sliced steel bands make up
this work. Here, the randomly
placed scales (which look like paper
airplanes made of steel), fragment
the ﬂat planar surface of Cantini’s
relief composition. The ﬁgure’s
pose, once again, contributes to
this piece’s visual movement. And
serving the purpose of what the
lassoing band did in the Point Park
piece are the three closely running

bands which unify the action of the-.

piece.

The outstretched figure is

bronze-gilded, and looks garrishlyi

awful, which prevents true enjoy-
ment of the piece. But the
symbolism of the piece is more
subtley‘ conveyed than in the
former one, and this is appreciated.
Impressions of this piece raise the
themes of Cruciﬁed Man, or
Agonized Modern Man, but
Cantini insists that he intends no
pessimism with his statement.
And on close inspection the viewer
senses that the human seems to be
in a working relationship with
science, for the
humanity.

His East Liberty fountain sculp-
,ture, in the center of the mall area,

benefit of

fairly rocks with energetic motion.
Six ﬁgures, seemingly chopped in
clean swipes of rusty steel, are
placed in a circle composition, each
figure facing into the ring in a
pattern that suggests joyous
dancing.

The work recalls Plato’s story of
the shadows in the cave, which
illustrated the philosophical
thought that we can never
experience each other more than
through reﬂections. A fatalistic
conception that I ﬁnd uncomfort-
able in Cantini’s representation,
are the faces, uplifted towards

- heaven and seem to be in a joyous

unity celebration with each other.
The feeling conveyed is refresh-
ingly heartening. \

The two ﬁgures in the chemistry
mural in the Natural Sciences
building are in contact with each
other, also. Almost touching
physically. This suggests the kind
of Michelangelo God-tou‘ching-
Adam-with-life symbolism that
lends to the theme of the piece in
numerous ways. Cantini is
illustrating the inception of

science, the inception of humanity,
etc., in this huge enamel on steel
work by portraying that the unity of
two substances, whether atoms or
humans, creates life.

Virgil Cantini is a proliﬁc Pittsburgh artist, as well as a Pitt professor,

 

whose dynamic, perhaps even brusque, personality overwhelms
reviewers and powerfully inﬂuences his art.

Along the same chemistry
theme, Cantini stretches out and
diagrams the two humans with
different portions of their anatomy
outlined and marked in various
color. This relates to the new X-ray
methods that use dye to visualize
inner organs of the body. The
result is ‘a highly appropriate
commision for that building, but
one that includes humanity in the
science of chemistry in away that
shows us as integral motivators and
benefactors of that ﬁeld.

Unfortunately Cantini hereis not
at his artistic best. His colors too
do,not inﬂect with each, other over

Photos by Rich Wilson
the large space. Of all Cantini

pieces, unity is lacking most here,
the lower left-hand corner of the
mural loosely attached to the rest of
the work.

Not so in his Law Building mural,
though. This excellent mid-
seventies work by Cantini is,
unfortunately, inside a seldom-

I used courtroom of that complex, a

. geometrical,

room that usually is locked. It is
one of his most tightly composed
and his best color-related enamel
work on ‘public’ display. It is ﬁtted
in the wall‘ behind the judge’s
bench, and beﬁtting the room, is
executed in red, white and blue.

Justice is the theme, and the
composition is somewhat dictated
by this concept. For example:

white dots and clashes in one strip

spell out “The truth, the whole '
truth and nothing but the truth” in I

Morse Code.

Cantini transfers his highly
planar style from
sculpture to these ﬂat surface
murals. Here, his structural
elements are trapezoidal rectan-
gles, lines and pushing and pulling
against each other in a highly
uniﬁed and taunt composition.

Clearly, Cantini’s personality is
reflected in these works. The
conﬂicts he sets up within his
works and resolves with dynamism
could not be created with as
exciting results as they are without
that quality in their creator.

  Thoughtful, Fun, Theatre X 

BY ALEX LEVIN

The Wreck: A Romance
Theatre X

Theatre X, the Pittsburgh 99 cent

‘Floating Th_eatre’s second -event of ~.~- '-

the new year, gave theatergoers
something to think about over the
weekend. In presenting its play,
The Wreck: A,Romance, Theatre X
handed the audience a sharp
mixture of conventional and not-so-
conventional drama, all working in
the smooth rhythm that only a
hard-working collective can
achieve. The acting was vibrant,
the humor refreshing and the
lighting was brilliant.

But, although the audience
seemed to enjoy the show. most
came out from the theater wearing
puzzled expressions. Therein lies
the power of Theatre X and other
contemporary groups: to possess
the ability to make an audience

take home the play in their 1

thoughts.

The Wreck raised many ques-
tions about romance, about human
needs and desires,»that just can’t
be shoved aside or easily solved.

And if anyone wanted to talk about .

those questions, the members of
the cast were more than happy to
discuss them afterwards. That is
the refreshing pleasure about most
Floating Theater events. They
don’t exclude the audience from

the experience. They are usually ,
not ‘just’ plays to’ entertain but:

experiences with a sincere

direction.

Several more theatre productions ’

are being brought in by the
Floating Theater. The next, mime
comedian Julian Chagrin will be at
Chatham College Feb. ll, 12, 13.
And, on Feb. 20, the Iowa Theater
Lab will hold an open audition for a
week long workshop. Workshops
are also planned with other groups
coming in at later dates.

Although at times Floating
Theater events may seem boring,
ridiculous, or just plain weird, as
with Theatre X, they can be
worthwhile experiences that stay
with a person long after the show is
over.

’Day’ With The ‘Best Beatle’

BY TOM WASELESKI

John Lennon: One Day at a Time,
by Anthony Fawcett. Grove Press,
$6.95.

Anthony Fawcett was a London
art critic when he first ran into
Japanese artist Yoko Ono. What
ﬁrst was a casual subject-reviewer
relationship with an avant-garde
painter soon became a long-stand-
ing professional camaraderie with
the man who was the brain, if not
the best, of the Beatles.

Fawcett chronicles his lively
association with John Lennon as if
the outspoken Beatle was born the
day he met Yoko. Indeed, Fawcett
may have something in the

    

suggestion.
His interesting account is lucid in
narrative and lush with rare
photographs, enough to make it a
must for those who still carry the
torch for the Liverpool quartet.
Fawcett, who worked for the
Lennons. as a personal secretary
during some of John’s most trying
years, offers an inside view of what
it ‘vas like to be dominated
musically by an egocentric Paul
McCartney. The author arouses

sympathy for Lennon easily,
especially in the following retort
John allegedly made to Paul one day
in the studio.

“If you look back on the Beatles’
albums,” Lennon said, “good or
bad or whatever you think of ’em,
you’ll find that most times if
anybody had got extra time it’s
youl...‘Cause there was a time,

 
  

John Leue ek,
as he looked in younger, happier
days.

about three years ago, I gave up
ﬁghting for an ‘A’ side or ﬁghting
for time. I just thought, well I'm
content to put ‘Walrus’ on the‘ ‘B’
side, when I think it’s much better,
and V ‘Strawberry Fields,’ because
I'm content to be on, yer know, and
get the cooperation of the group to
produce a ‘Walrus’ and a ‘Straw-

berry Fields’ out of all of you.”

Fawcett doesn’t shed any new
light on the infamous breakup,
although he does reopen the old
wound for those who regarded the
Beatles as more than mere
musicians.

The uncharted territory he does
explore involves Lennon’s artistic
and political involvements from
1968 to the present. Remember
those cute shorts at the end of the
evening news about John Lennon
mailing peace acorns to heads of
state for Christmas, John Lennon
buying billboards in world capitals,
reading “War Is Over,” John
Lennon in bed for peace, John
Lennon singing on stage with a
black bag, containing his wife, at his
feet, for peace?"

One Day at a Time provides the
rationale for those media events;
those acts that served only to have
the Beatles’ intentions treated with
less seriousness.

About the only problem with the O

Fawcett book is its extensive use of
the now-famous Rolling Stone
interview with Lennon. The author
uses the quotes as a crutch to fill in
gaps and make for smooth
transition.

Other than that, One Day at a
Time is the closest thing we have to

a competent critical biography of ,

John Lennon, Beatle and man. With
some rare Lennon spinning on the
turntable, like the live “Well (Baby
Please Don’t Go)” from the Some
Time in New York City album,
latter-day Beatle devotees could
lose themselves in those old, golden
days that ﬂit past on Fawcett’s
pages.

The Panther basketball squad
travels to South Bend, Indiana,
tonight to meet the Fighting Irish of
Notre Dame (8-5) with tipoff
scheduled for 8 p.m.

Still reeling from the 96-74 loss to
the Syracuse Orangemen last
Saturday night, coach Tim Grgur-

ich’s troops will journey to Notre
Dame without the services of junior
guard Scott Nedrow, who is
hampered by a shoulder injury that
will keep him out of action at least
until Saturday, when the Panthers
travel to State College to tangle with
the Nittany Lions of coach Johnny

will miss the trip.

Also on the upcoming agenda are
home games with Cincinnati,
ranked twelfth in the nation this
week after suffering its first two
losses of the season over the
weekend, and Massachusetts. The
Cats .visit Morgantown for a
rematch with the West Virginia
Mountaineers February 9 before
returning home to battle Duquesne
at the Field House February 12.
Then will come a trip to College
Park, Maryland, to face Lefty
Drisel1’s Terrapins, always a
national power, February 15.

Realistically, the Panthers have
experienced a horrendous season
thus far, and, with the just-
mentioned upcoming schedule, it
appears things will get worse
before they get better. I

With only three marks in the
victory column after ﬁfteen games,
the Panthers have a good chance to
ﬁnish with one of their worst
won-lost records ever, reverting to
the form which produced victory
totals of seven, ﬁve, six, seven, and
four during the 1965-69 era under
Coach Bob Timmons, who was
replaced by Buzz Ridl after the
1967-68 campaign.

Ridl’s teams played just over .500
ball during his first four years

a before exploding into national

prominence with an outstanding
25-4 record and a trip to the NCAA
Eastern Regional ﬁnals in 1974,
losing to the eventual national
champion, North Carolina State,
and superman David Thompson.
The 1974-75 season saw the Cats
slip abit, to an 18-11 mark, but they

gained a bid to the NIT, being -

ousted by Providence in the second
round. That year also marked
Coach Ridl’s retirement and the
emergence of former Pitt back-

Kent As Easy As ACC

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

It’s nice to be on top again.
The Pantherettes, after that crush-
ing defeat at Ohio State, bounced
back to crush Allegheny Commun-

ity:College, 112-25, Saturday night »

and rip Kent State, 98-38, Monday
evening.

“The competition both Saturday
and Monday--well, ACC wanted
the game, so we played,” Coach
Pat Wallace shrugged.

“We just kind of rolled over
them.”

Pitt led ACC, 56-14, at the half.
Four Pantherettes scored in double
ﬁgures: leading scorer Wanda
Randolph led with 15 points, Dana
Elder had 14 and Mimi Senkowski
and freshman guard Kathy Pacz-

kowski each tipped in 10. Pitt
outrebounded ACC, 52-21, with
Randolph leading the pack with
nine. The Pantherettes led in
assists, 19-4, behind Elder’s seven.

In the Kent State game, Pitt led
the Golden Flashes by 66-21 atthe
half. Five Pantherettes were in the
double-ﬁgure bracket. Randolph
slammed in 22 points and forward
Kim Raymond, ﬁnally recovered
from a lingering knee injury, added
15. Barb Welsh had 16, and
Senkowski and Robin Fry handed
in 10 apiece. Pitt led in rebounds,
60-14, with Raymond grabbing 14
and Randolph coming down with a
dozen.

The Pantherettes showed great
improvement in the foul situation,
a sore point throughout the season.

lcers Expire Guarantee

BY JIM PANE

While cross-town rival Duquesne
prepares to duke it out with the Pitt
Hockey Club tonight in a 7:30 p.m.
game at the Civic, Arena, the
Panthers are still remembering last
year’s “Guaranteed Win Day.”

“Guaranteed Win Day”, if you’ll
recall, was Pitt’s version of countin g
their goals before they were scored-
The Panthers were thinking of their
11-2 manhandling of the Dukes
earlier in the season and thus.
before their second encounter, they
predicted a sure win at the risk of
giving everyone in attendance a free
ticket to the next home game if they

lost.
Final score of “Guaranteed Win

Day,” 1976-—Duquesne 2, Pitt 1.
“Yea, that’s sticking in my neck

pretty good,” Head Coach Len

Barcalow admitted. “A lot of the

. guys who were around last year still

remember it too.”

Barcalow refuses, however, to let
last year’s embarrassment get in
the way of tonight’s effort.

“We won’t make the mistakes we
made last year,” he promised.

“There’ll be some steamboatin’
out there.”

But Barcalow will be the first to
tell you about the old adage of how
“any team can beat any other team
on any given night."

There’s another old saying, too.
It goes something like, “Remember
Guaranteed Win Day.”

fouls in the ACC contest, Pitt pared
its errors to 18 against Kent State’s
32. -

“Turnovers are costing us and
we’re still committing as many
against the smaller schools as the
tough ones,” Wallace said.

“We’re still lacking consistency. I

At times, our fast break looks
beautiful, our defense looks
tremendous——but we have to do
that 20 minutes each half.”

With the loss of guard Peggy
Dugan, Elder and Paczkowski have
both put out a ﬁne effort to fill the
gap-—especially in dishing out
assists. ‘

“Dana has really come on
strong and we’re looking to her and
Kathy to keep us going,” Wallace
said. “Some of our younger
players are coming along well.
We're hoping the more they play,
the more help they'll be on the
road."

The two easy games were just
what the team needed—“it gave us
a chance to play’ everyone,"
Wallace said———and Pitt will start a
three-game road trip with a bit of a
winning streak. The trip will
include games with Cheyney State,
Towson and Edinboro. While the
Pantherettes managed to defeat
Cheyney and Towson last year.
both will have the edge of a home-
court advantage this time.
Edinboro edged out the Panther-
ettes at Fitzgerald Field House last
season, and this trip the Fighting
Scots will have the home court plus
the services of a transfer from
lmmaculata.

“We don't have any easy games
left." Wallace said, and the trip
will Show just how well Pitt stacks
up against the best in college
basketball-——or if the Ohio State
game was an omen of things to
come. '

Wednesday, .lanuaryc26; 1977—THE PI-TT NEWS‘—=Page is

ing Like A “ame” For Pitt

courtman Tim Grgurich, who had
served as an assistant coach for 10
seasons, as head man.

Last year, beset by countless
injuries that resulted in the loss of
several key performers, the Pan-
thers still managed some respect-
ability, ﬁnishing 12-15 with a
patchwork lineup.

This brings us to 1976-77 and a
team that Grgurich claimed, “has
the potential to make a strong run at
the Top 20.”

Well, the Bottom 20 is actually

    
 

Pitt News

Sports

 

more like it, and the reasons for the
sudden turn-about must be un-
covered and corrected.

Some, including Grgurich, keep
pointing to the fact the Panthers are
inexperienced, with two and
sometimes three freshmen in the
starting lineup. They also point out
the top eight players include two
sophomores and three juniors, one
of whom is a junior college transfer
and new to the Pitt system.

But, realistically, it seems a
combination of three major factors
has led to the plight of the Panthers.
In addition to the experience factor,
which is brought up so often, it is
evident there is an overall lack of
major college basketball talent on
the Pitt roster. This is not intended
as a knock against any current
Panthers, because few teams play
harder or with more desire than
Grgurich’s crew. It is just that the
overall talent is not there.

The third factor is the inability of
the newcomers to the squad to learn
and -execute Coach Fran Webster's
famed “amoeba” defense. This
year’s ‘/amoeba” just hasn’t done
the job, being exploited for 103
points by Iowa, 100 by WVU, 96 by
Syracuse, 94 by George Washing-
ton and an average of 82 points per
game by all opponents.

In recent contests, the Cats have
switched to more conventional
defenses——-a straight man-to-man
and a basic zone defense-—with
hopes of plugging some defensive
gaps and putting an end to the
numerous back-door plays that have
resulted in many easy layups for the
opposition.

Another factor which should be
mentioned is that many of the

newcomers were simply overrated
before the season began. Mike
Rice, a potentially ﬁne strong
forward, has been forced to play out
of position at center much of the
time. Although he has proven to be
a fairly consistent rebounder, he
has _ had trouble adapting to the
“amoeba” and needs to be more
selective shot-wise.

Sonny Lewis has the potential to
become a truly outstanding college
player, but needs to be settled into
one position, probably as the
shooting guard. Sonny has
displayed good shot selection, but
hasn’t rebounded much despite
great natural leaping ability.

Eddie Scheuermann‘, 6-11 center,
needs more bulk and more
aggressiveness so he won’t get
pushed around under the boards.
He’s been coming along in spurts,
but could usesome work on his
offensive moves and building up
some muscle.

Another newcomer, point guard
Dave Washington, has had a couple
of good games, but has a tendency
to foul excessively and isn’t much of
an offensive threat, while 6-11
Kelvin Smith has been progressing
slowly, hampered by what appears
to m be a lack of desire and
aggressiveness needed to compete
in major college basketball.

So, with 11 games remaining on
the regular schedule, the Panthers
need a quick turn—around to gain
any amount of respectability going
into the East Indies Tournament in
Philadelphia, March 2, 4 and 5, in
which all eight members of the new
conference will compete for the
right to advance to the NCAA
tournament.

Tankers Liquidate Ohio

BY JOHN FINN

You don’t often see a team from
Ohio State overwhelmed or out-
classed. But ‘ such was the case
Saturday as the Pantherette tankers-
ripped the Buckeyes, 86-45, in
Columbus.

Pitt captured first place in 11 of 15
events and ﬁnished second in eight
times. 1

_. The team of Diane Kluglein,
Susan Guyer, Nila DeJesus and
Cristy Elston got the Pantherettes
splashing in the right direction by
winning the 400-yard medley relay..

Kathy Stetler and Sandy Moran

I followed suit by placing one-two,

respectively, in the 200-yard
freestyle.

The meet included two long-dis-
tance events; the 400-yard individ-
ual medley and the grueling
1650-yard freestyle. Pitt’s Jamie
Conley took first and Jennifer Price
placed second in the’ 400-yard
individual medley; an event that
includes two lengths each of four
different strokes.

Meanwhile, Moran and Judy
Heretick placed first and third,
respectively, in the 1650-yard
freestyle. Pitt coach Kate Mathison
praised Moran for her performance
in the 66-length event.

“Sandy swam a very nice race,”
she said‘ enthusiastically, ‘ ‘in a very

difficult event.”

In other events, once again it was
Stetler who led the way for Pitt. In
addition to winning the 100 and

’ 200-yard freestyles, Stetler captur-

ed the 50-yard butterlfy.

Besides aiding the 400-yard relay
squad, Kluglein notched a first in
the 50-yard backstroke, while Guyer
landed a first in the 50-yard
breastroke. Elston captured the
200-yard backstroke and added a
second in the 50-yard freestyle.

By the time the one-meter diving
rolled around, Pitt had the meet
well in hand.

Linda Hamner took advantage of
the big lead and glided to a
ﬁrst-place ﬁnish in the one-meter
diving. This qualiﬁed her for AIAW
Nationals. Jenny Brooker placed
third in the competition.

In the three-meter diving, Cindy
Ferraro placed second and Connie
Heister finished third.

Pitt dropped the final relay, but,
by that time, the Buckeyes had.
drowned in defeat. The powerful
Pantherettes convincingly beat
Ohio State and now begin preparing
for one of the biggest meets of the
season with Penn State, scheduled
this Saturday at 2 p.m. in Trees
Pool.

“Ohio State’s women’s swim-
ming program is just getting off the
ground,” Mathison explained,
“but Penn State has a very strong
team. We’re going to have our
hands full and we could use the
support of the fans.”

The meet will feature some of the
top swimmers in the East and
should prove to be a good one.

BY JIM GEF SKY

The Pitt men’s
team must envy Rip Van Winkle.
While the bearded gentleman was
able to rest for twenty years, the
Panthers could do so for only six
days—a period that was insuf-
ﬁcient for them to avoid experien-
cing fatigue at Kent State last
Friday.

The Kent State meet was
sandwiched between last week’s
Ohio State and Penn State matches
and this week’s upcoming contest
with Maryland, Pitt’s most difficult
stint of the season. Thus Coach
‘Dick Bradshaw was concerned that
his team would not be in the best of
condition for the Golden Flashes.

His fears were somewhat conﬁrm- .

ed, but the Panthers did stay awake
long enough to defeat Kent State,
61-52.

The tankers performed well in"

the individual swimming events,

although they did lose both relays. '

The star of the meet was Jerry
DeMuro, Pitt’s All-American can-
didate, who won the 500-yard
freestyle race with a 4244.7, and set
a Kent State pool record with his
winning time of 9:47.5 in the
1000-yard freestyle. Mark Schu-
man took the 200-yard individual
medley with a 1258.7 (another pool
record), and Orlando Catinchi won
the 200-yard breastroke with a time
of 2:l4.5.

But the diving was probably the
most impressive aspect of the meet
as Pitt won both events despite
Tom Fatyol’s absence due to the

4 Ribik Migrates South For
Goodwill Basketball Tour:

BY MARIA SCIULLO

While Pittsburgh shivers through

its worst cold spell in years, Marie

Ribik is enjoying summer weather
in Peru. Saturday, she ﬂew to South
America with 19 other athletes for a
goodwill basketball tour against the
Peruvian Olympic and Federation
teams.

The women’s team, coached by
Mt. A1vernia’s Dee Porzcunik, is
comprised mainly of outstanding
Eastern athletes who are not
currently involved in college or high ‘
school basketball. Also on the team
from Pitt is Kate Szramowski.
Former Duquesne assistant coach
Jim Sims will head up the group and
coach the men's team. Playing for
the U.S. team will be former
Panthers Mickey Martin, Carl
Morris and Donnie Wilson and
native Pittsburgher Dwight Clay,
who starred at Notre Dame.

Ribik, a guard, was a three-year
letter-winner in volleyball, basket-
ball and track at Elizabeth-Forward
High School. Beside sparking her
team to the state basketball ﬁnals in
her senior year, she also was
runner-up in the PIAA high jump
two years in a row.

Her fourth-place success in the
AIAW (Association, for Intercolle-
giate Athletics for Women) national
high jump ﬁnals last spring is
typical of the great progress Marie
has made since joining the
Pantherette track team as a
walk-on.

Jumping coach Chuck Arm-

strong, who states, “Marie has
terrific ability and has yet to reach
her potential,” changed the sandy-
haired sophomore’s old-fashioned
“scissors” technique to that of the
more effective “Fosbury Flop” and
soon Marie began clearing higher
marks.

“I’d have to say that Coach
Armstrong was definitely the
biggest inﬂuence in my athletic
career,” Ribik said. Ribik, with a
personal best of 5-9, has set several
new goals for herself. “First, I want
to get my technique down, so that
it’s smooth and consistent. Then,
I’d like to compete in the AAU
Nationals this year.

Alfreda Goff, women’s track
coach, is excited about her jumper’ s
potential.  "

“I could talk forever about
Marie,” she declared. “She’s a
fantastic person and a real team
leader. Last season, she proved to
be a pleasant surprise, because I'd
ﬁgured the change inform would
take a while to perfect. Being asked
to represent her ‘ country in
basketball gives you an idea of what
a high-caliber athlete she is.”

So tremendous were her accom-
plishments last year, she was
named athlete of the year in her
hometown of Elizabeth.

When the U.S. basketball squad
returns February 4, following stops
in Equador and Colombia, it will be
obvious to partisans of the February
5 Pitt Invitationals who Marie Ribik
is. She'll be the blonde with the
suntan.
