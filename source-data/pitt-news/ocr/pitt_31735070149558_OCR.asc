Speakers talk
Ramadan road
trip at Pitt

By Em Maier
wstaﬁ‘ Writer

On a Ramadan road trip across

America, two men vowed to spend
each night of the ninth month of
the Islamic calendar at a different
mosque.

Aman Ali, 27, and Bassam Tariq,
25, found themselves stranded in
rural Montana with a broken rent-
al car. After relying on the help of
a friendly ﬁsherman, they set off
with a repaired vehicle but were

unable to make their intended"

destination that night in Fargo,
North Dakota.

Desperate to ﬁnd a mosque,
they frantically began a search for
another Muslim community in the
state and stumbled across the ﬁrst
established Muslim community in
the U.S. — located in Ross, North
Dakota.

More than 150 mosques,
25,000 miles and two Ramadans
later, the two American men have
ended their fasting and cross-
country travels. But they continue
to speak to communities, colleges
and other groups, narrating the
stories of contemporary Muslim
America.

Ali, a comedian, and Tariq, a
ﬁlmmaker and advertising copy-
writer, spoke of their two-year
travels at “30 Mosques in 30 Days”
Friday night at David Lawrence
Hall. ‘

The event, hosted by Pitt’s
Muslim Student Association, drew
more than 80 people and served as
the conclusion to Islamic Aware-
ness Week.

“Every step of the way, we were ’

amazed at how this community-

U.S. Rep. Mike Doyle discusses iddle East

By Gretchen” Andersen
Senior Staﬁ" Writer

U.S. Rep. Mike Doyle, D—Pa.,_ made
it clear that military action against
Iran’s nuclear program should be
carefully weighed and “all options
should be on the table.”

“As far as I’m concerned,.mili—
tary action to prevent Iran from
acquiring a nuclear weapon should
be our absolute last resort,” Doyle
said.

Doyle’s comments were part
of “Congressman Doyle on the
Middle East,” an event held Fri-
day night in the William Pitt Union
and sponsored by the Pittsburgh
Israel Public Affairs Committee.

The representative’s speech
focused on U.S.—Israel relations,
Iran’s nuclear enrichment pro-
gram and the role of the U.S. in

the Middle East. About 20 stu-
dents and community members
attended the 30-minute speech

and 15-minute question and an- _

swer session.

Doyle spoke about how the
recent Arabnspring uprisings in
countries like Egypt, Jordan and
Syria have raised questions about
.Israel’s security. However, despite
the changes, Doyle said U.S. sup-
port for Israel will not falter.

One of the “greatest chal-
lenges,” Doyle said, is the Israeli-
Palestinian conﬂict. Doyle said
if Israel and the Palestine could
reach a peace agreement, it would
“mitigate public hostility toward
Israel and improve the security
situation.”

However, he also said that the
possibility of a peace agreement
seems »‘‘difficult, and maybe even
impossible, in the immediate fu-

" Doyle also spoke about Iran’s
nuclear weapons program and
efforts by the Obama Adminis-
tration, Congress_and the Unit-
ed Nations to sanction and talk
with Iranian leaders, pointing to
legislation passed by Congress
in December sanctioning banks
and businesses with Iran’s cen-
tral bank. _ '

A military attack on Iran is
‘being studied by both the U.S. and
Israeli militaries, Doyle said.

“Needless to say, Iran’s re-
sponse has been very intense:
It’s threatened to close the Strait
of Hormuz to oil tankers. The
Iranian government has also

a threatened to cut off oil to the EU
. immediately before those‘coun—

tries can get alternative supplies,”
Doyle said. V _

cently estimated that an Israeli

could increase the price of gas in

In Doyle’s opinion, if the new
sanctions — which he said “have

teeth” — don’t wo_rk, then “we.

need to talk about military op-
tions.”” '

“But I think it only makes
sense to see whether the new ﬁ-
nancial sanctions and the EU’s oil
boycott will have a desired effect,”

— Doyle said. ’
Despite the current sanctions,.

Doyle said it is “irresponsible” for
presidential candidates to push
for military action at this time

Student band Too Young to openfor

Byjoe Chilson
Staﬂ” Writer

New band Too Young got their big break on,
Thursday night when they took ﬁrst place at
Pitt’s annual Battle of the Bands.

Too Young beat out 15 bands at the com-

petition hosted by Pitt Program Council '

last Friday. Though Battle of the Bands was
only the fourth gig that Too Young has per-
formed at, they will be quickly thrust into

. thespotlight, opening ‘for Cobra Starship_

and Twenty One Pilots at this year’s Bigelow

V be a way to score points in the presiden-
tialrace. ' l

Junior Sam Lapin, a member of PIPAC,

. agreed. Lapin said voters understand when

candidates are pandering to them for votes.
Lapin said military action has to .be solely

considered as a last resort and nothing‘

else. .
“It’s almost offensive advocating war. I
have family in Israel, and if there is awar, I

know people who will be immediately called '

up [to the‘ military] ,” Lapin said. ‘_
Doyle, who has four children, said he

thinks‘ of them when talking about military

action. _
“Any time we talk of war, I think that

is ‘something we should do lightly, and not -

so°methin'g to get votes. I think it’s impor-
tant to remember we are talking about com-
mitting young men and women,” Doyle
said. ‘ '

Organizer of the event Noah Tankin, a‘

sophomore, said he asked Doyle to visit

’ campus to talk about the Middle East be-

cause of the recent events in Gaza, Syria,
Egypt and Iran’. I . ‘ v

~ Tankin said Iran’s'nuclear weapon
program would be a game changer in the
Middle East, initiating an arms race in the
region. ’ I

“Come ‘November, after the elections, -

we’ll see who really cares,’? Tankin said. I

The event began at 10 p.m. in the William
Pitt Union Assembly Room and wrapped up
around 12:30 a.m. ‘ ' .

' - Alana Miller, a member of Pitt Program
Council and the event’s organizer, said in an
email that more than 250 students attended
the event, , ' - '

“It feels great and we’re all pretty ex-

~cit_ed,” said sophomore Eric Matthew Silver-
man, singer and guitarist for Too Young.

The band’s other three member are all
Pitt students and include brothers Tim
Crammond, who plays guitar, andjay Cram-
mond, who plays drums, as'well as bassist
Richar'd Fontanese, whom the band refers

to as “Steamboat.”-
Silverman said that Too Young’s sound
comes from music he writes and records at
home that he brings to the band. The other
members then put their own touch on it,
giving it a rock-and—roll e_dge.
' Silverman said he was impressed with
this year’s Battle of the Bands event because
it was better promoted than in years past.

“There were a lot of people in the-audi- I

ence this year, it was very’ well done,” Sil-
verman said. V
Miller agreed saying that “the event went

very smoothly, ’ and called it “extremely
successful.” I ‘ ' '

at how many people hear about this. We

Both Tariq and Ali expressed their grati-

noticed how many mosques were in their
nearby New York City community. Urged by

“For us, "we wanted to‘

share stories. It could
be positive’, it-could be
negative. It could be in
the middle.” L
— Bassam Tariq

Twitter and Facebook to set forth across »

America and maintain a blog on the indi-
viduals they met.
“When we set out we had no intent. For

us, we wanted toshare stories. It could be.

positive, it could be negative. It could be in
the middle,” Tariq said. .
Ali agreed. 1 ‘
“We’re trying to put out authentic por-
trayals. Lilge any community, we’re not ex-
empt from any criticism. We don’t want to

_ sweep ugly things under the rug. We want to '

talk about problems openly and honestly,”
he said. A - -
The duo shared heartwarming and co-
medic stories, interacting with the audience
constantly, partially due to Ali’s comedic

_ background.
_. They recounted tales of faraway romance, V
of ﬁnding one’s identity, of acceptance and

second chances. One phrase, from a Califor-
nia_n mosque, resonated deeply with Ali and
Tariq: “Come as you are to Islam as is.”
“We,as human beings —— we are simple
people by nature, but over centuries we’ve

“ added bureaucratic junk and complicated

everything,” Ali said.
Tariq, the quieter of the two, illustrat-
ed problems across Muslim America. One

» problem he said was ‘the divide between

immigrant Muslims and those who had
converted to Islam. The problem with this
is imposing cultural standards from both
sides. ' . .

j The pair has become famous across the
world. Other religions andindividuals have
begun their own “30 Days” tribute, and

newspapers and television networks such A
. as BBC and CNN have documented Ali and

Tariq’s road trip, which will culminate in a
ﬁlm premiering on PBS next year.‘
'- As for what’s next, the-pair is consider-

ing an interactive project with people con- '

tributing their daily stories, weaving it into
a ﬁlm or community project showcasing
the Muslim community around the world.
They plan to continue visiting colleges,
as they believe the youth are what drove
the project. , A

Pitt’s MSA president, sophomore Louie

In . Al-Hashimi, said he was thrilled by the
performance. _ ,
“Going along withthe theme of this [30

Mosques], just goingoutside your bubble,
outside your comfort zone, is something
that our organization strives for. It may not
necessarily be a road trip, but we want to
stretch ourselves to our limits,” Al-Hashimi
said.

. wrenches —— to lose out on that

essential summer internship, to
be passed up in that audition or to

' fail to ﬁnd that desired pos_t-grad-

uation job can deal heavy blows to
our sense of “story control.” And

it often gets even worse when we .
tie our coincidental shortcomings '

and our neighbors’ successes to
individual immutable character-

over one’s life might feel empower-

unleashes the great risk of sustain:

damage to one’s dignity.

When storyline deviations‘ ‘

threaten our‘ dignity — as they
may for Pitt students now looking
at spending the next summer, year
or couple of years at home instead
of at a dream job or internship —
we employ innate mechanisms to
contain the blowback. It’s called

reducing the cognitive dissonance. «

But dismissing admissions oﬂicers
as blindfolded pigs or casting re-
maining options in the rosiest of
lights only serve as incomplete pal-
liatives; they don’t prevent future

it’s hurting him; the popular idea
that we pilot our ship of signiﬁ-
cant life events (including career

sion. “Story control” is ,a Class—A
fallacy. ‘

Relinquishing “story control”-
thinking may seem to ﬂy in the
face of human nature. We’re pri-
mordially disposed to assign all

' sorts of explanations to the world’s

phenomena after they occur, re-
gardless of evidence. When these

phenomena involve our own fates,

we draw causal linesback to our
virtues, on the one hand, or to our
vices, on the other. Such ex-post

young people are investing substantial emo-
tional capital —? and, in especially desperate
cases, identity —. in distant career plans,
and they’re consequently dooming them-
selves to a life—long psychological pummel-
ing by all—powerful mother chance, who so
often ripsplans and planners apart. Except
perhaps as a loose hypothetical exerciseor
to survive conversations with particularly
dull people at parents’ dinner parties, long-
term planning isn’t worth it. _ .

Throwing away plans doesn’t mean pack-
ing up and seceding from society. A distinc-
tio'n must be made between planning and
preparing, as it’s foolish to do the ﬁrst and
foolish to neglect the second.

Since the bulk of lifeis deciding moments

~

constitutes gambles of unknown probabili-

ties, the way to prepare is to engage in a lot ’

of positive gambling. Positive gambling in
this sense doesn’t entail wagering grand-

mother’s doll collection against the chance

to win big if oil prices go up or down. It
means actively exposing oneself to every

last opportunity for chance to turn in one’s ,

favor .— betting on as broad and deep of

an education as possible, attending p1_'ofes- V .
r sional conferences with potential graduate

mentors, even retiring shyness so as to party

with fellow students who might be future

co—workers.. I . ‘ -

In the end, strength of character or iden-s .

tity should not be deﬁned by the «success

. someone plansfor himself, but by how he be-

u

haves today, with or without job, internship
or graduate opportunities. That’s because, it
should be stressed, successful people don’t
wield some advantage in character or iden-
tity. They either luck out early on, or they
just play the game more often. With this

in mind, downtrodden Pitt folk might ﬁnd l

solace in repeating the phrase, “I don’t know
what I’m going todo with my -life, butl know
I’ll be me, ferociously.”- I

MEN’$ BASKETBALL

Pitt, Wahington

By Greg Trietley
‘ Senior Staﬁ” Writer

The Pitt men’s basketball team
didn’t plan on playing the Washing-
ton State Cougars once this season,
let alone three times.

But the Panthers (20-16) and
Cougars (18-16) will meet this week
in the ‘best-of-three College Bas-
ketball Invitational championship
series. Pitt will play the Cougars in
Pullman, Wash.,.at Beasley Coli-
seumtonight at 10 p.m., then the
series shifts to the Petersen Events

Center for games Wednesday and,‘

if necessary, Friday.

It’s an unfamiliar situation for
both schools in more ways than
one. Pitt hasn’t traveled to Pullman
since 1982 — before the current

members of the team were born — ‘

and the program has never played
Washington State at Beasley Coli-
seum.

  SPORT

tate face off i BI finals

Huailei Wang I Senior Staff Photographer
J.j. Moore (No. 44) and Pitt will face Washington State in a best-of-three championship series.

The Cougars, meanwhile, have
never played at the Petersen Events
Center. The only meeting between
the two teams came in a neutral-site
Legends Classic game in Newark in
2008, which Pitt won, 57-43. V

And neither team has ever
played a best-of—three series.

“It’s obviously something differ-
ent that we’ve never been involved
in,” Pitt head coach Jamie Dixon’
said Friday. “I’ve talked to teams
that have played in this [best-of-
three] situation, and they liked the
setup. Of course, I talked to the guys
that won, so that might have had 
something to do with it.”

Dixon said that for Pitt, the only
previous schedule close to resem-
bling the CBI championship for-
mat came in Big East play, when the
Panthers played St. John’s twice in
one week this season and West Vir-
ginia twice in nine days in 2010.

Both teams must cope with the '
cross-country travel schedule that

 

arises with the best-of-three series.
Washington State didn’t travel east
of Kansas City during the regular
season. Pitt, meanwhile, returned
home from Butler Friday morning
and ﬂew to Spokane Saturday night,
practicing at Gonzaga Sunday.

There isn’t much time for either
team to prepare,

“Right now I haven’t watched
much ﬁlm,” Pitt point guard Tra-

V Von Woodall said Friday. “I haven’t ‘_

really gotten the chance to watch
them.~I think I watched one game,
whengthey played Oregon State at
home.”

Dixon said Friday that Wash-
ington State runs more‘ zone than

it did in 2008 under former coach ,

Tony Bennett, when Pitt shot 35.4

percent from the floor in a hard-

fought, low-scoring game. '

FOOTBALL ”

  Panthers

By Lauren Kirschman
‘Sports Editor

Last year, the Pitt football team
used‘ spring practice to transition
to a new system and grow comfort-
able with a new head coach and
his staff. ’
This year, the ‘Panthers started
all over again. - ‘. A.
1 .Head coach Paul Chryst took
over ‘for former head coach Todd
Graham,»who took the same posi-
tion at Arizona State after spend-
ing just a year with the Panthers.

I’m waking up at six in the morn-
ing and I’m not dreading coming
over here.”

The defensive line —- particu-
larly sophomore defensive tackle
Aaron Donald — was impressive
on Saturday and has been perform-
ing well during spring practice.
Sunseri said that facing Donald
and the defensive line can only
make the offense better. ,'

“Whenever.you’re going against
good competition, all it does is,
heighten everyone around you,”
Sunseri said. “You’re going to get
better on your techniques because
most likely, you’re going to not ﬁnd
a guy like Aaron Donald on a lot of

teams.

that is more
similar to for-
mer head coach
Dave Wannst-

than Graham’s
fast-paced of-
fense.

back Tino Sun-
seri said that a

“If youare

Sunseri add-

ed. _

“You have to go out here and
do something and make your mis-
takes, then go into the ﬁlm room .
and be able to adjust and make cor-
rections,”Sunseri said.

Backup quarterback Mark My-
ers said that this year’s transition
has been easier for him than the
change last spring. ,

“I get this a lot better,” Myers
said. “I came to Pitt for pro-style.
I’ve been working in it my whole
life and I got it down pretty well.
It’s a lot easier than last year.”

Wide receiver Cameron Saddler
added that this year’s change is a‘
good one that isn’t just affecting
the team’s performance, but also
its attitude. . ‘ '

“Everyone on the ﬁeld can tell
this change is for the better and
everybody’s embracing it,” Saddler
said. “Everyone seems to be bought

Saturday.

“You got to give credit to the,”

and correct them.” -

“This hasn’t been one_of the mid-year
practices where we’re going hard all the
time,” he said Saturday. “It’s more get in,

get what we have to get done, get out and,

rest. A lot of us are beat up.” '
One of Washington State’s beat—up players
is leading scorer Brock Motum, who aver-

ages 18 points and 6.4 rebounds per game. '

He sprained his ankle two minutes into the
Cougars’ CBI semiﬁnal game against Oregon
State. . — . ' _
Washington State head coach Ken Bone
said, Motum is questionable-for Monday’s

chance,”.Bone said Saturday, adding that
the chances/are greater that Motum plays
Wednesday. ‘ F . ' .

X-rays taken during the Oregon State

~- game were negative. .

“We’re just trying to get the swelling down.
Then it’ll be good,” Motumsaid Saturday.

-“Right now, it’s all iced up, so it’s numb. I can’t

feel anything. It’s not like it’s excruciating
pain or anything.” -

Dixon said he is familiar with Motum from i

the 2009’ FIBA Under-19 World Champion-
ship, in which Motum played for Australia
and Dixon coached the Unitedistates.

“A'lot' of'those guys are popping up in

college over the years,” Dixon said.
Washington State senior guard Faisal

' Aden (14.5 points per game) is also out. He

suffered a season-ending torn ACL at Arizona .

onjan. 28.

-IfMotum misses Monday’s game, junior
guard Reggie Moore and senior forward Abe
Lodwick will be the Cougars’ top weapons
against Pitt. Lodwick and Moore had 23 and
22 points, respectively, in Washington State_’s
72-55 win over Oregon State on Wednes-
day. ' S '

' In Pitt’s three CBI wins, Woodall, Lamar
Patterson and JJ. Moore have carried the
team. Dixon said that the increase in touch-
es and plays for the trio isn’t because he is
phasing out seniors Ashton Gibbs and Nasir

‘ Robinson —— it’s just that the younger players

have matured. . A A

“Lamar, ‘over the last couple games, we’re V
running more plays for him, more sets. I

-think he’s— just gotten better as the year has
gone on,” Dixon said. “He’s shooting the ball

better. He’s making plays for other guys and ,

staying out of foul trouble, too.’_’
— Patterson has averaged 15 points in CBI
games. Woodall said that the 6-foot-5 sopho-

more reminds him of former Pitt guard Brad

Wanamaker, except with more size.
“Running the offense through him is like
running the offense through Brad. Plus now
you have a point guard that actually passes
the ball, and it’s a good look for next year,”

:Woodall said’. “Lamar is probably one of the

most Versatile players live come across. He
can play two through four, [positions] . Maybe
he could’ve played the ﬁve against Butler.”
Moore missed Saturdayfs practicedue to
a family emergency, but Dixon said that he

will not miss any games. I ’

he’s into it and giving effort. That is really
what you ask for and then it’s ‘Can we learn?
Are we going to repeat the same mistakes or

"are we going to learn from them?”’

Sunseri said that Bennett will continue
to grow as a player.
“As a running back, you have to be able to

V be a pass protector, you have to make sure 4

you get out on your routes and it’s a total
combination,” he said. “The best thing he

has is Ray [Graham]  That’s a guy you can .

look up to and make sure you’re a sponge

Bennett said that Graham has been en-
couraging and has offered advice on what he
should focus on. Bennett added that playing

last year will help him earn time on the ﬁeld '

this season, but he hesitated to call it a com-
petition between running backs.

A “I don’t really.say ‘competing’ because '
we -are working together,” he said. ‘N1 of .

.the running backs work together to make
the team better.” ' p
Chryst said that he didn’t come to Pitt
with any speciﬁc expectations regarding
the quarterbacks who will get Bennett the
ball and run" the offense. He said he’s had a
good experience working with Sunseri and
Myers so far, but added that there is room
for improvement. —
' ‘‘It’s funny, because when you talk abou
the group, it applies directlyto the quarter-

» on a second-and-three, then you’re back to
