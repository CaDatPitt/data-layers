Knouse Former Cadet

The boys involved in the inci-
dent were Bruce Coine, Arts‘ ’59;
Herb Dodell, Arts ’6l; Manny
Gabler, Bus. Ad ’61; Mike Gerber,
Arts ’59; Paul “Knobby” Knouse,
Bus. Ad. ’60, and Harvey Wim-
mer, Bus. Ad. ’59. * '

Knouse, a former cadet, aid-
ed the group with his knowledge
of the Point.

Arriving late Monday night at
the twelve-foot cyclone fence sur-
rounding the Point, the boys be-
gan tackling the problem imme-
diately. ' , _

, Scale, Unravel Fence
_ Coine and Knouse scaled the
fence while the other four began
unravelling the wire to make an
opening big enough for the mule.

Sneaking past the sleeping
guards into the veteranarian’s
quarters, Coine and Knouse
found Poncho -in his engraved
stall, sawed the lock off the
entrance of the building and
led Poncho straight out the
form; door.

A little trouble developed on the
way back to the fence when the
mule became stubborn and refus-

.ed to move. But bribing Poncho
with chewing gum and sugar, the
party succeeded in escaping with
their prize through the large gap

‘gin the West Point fence.

however, after successfully elud-
ing some local residents, ran
head—on into the local police.
Taken in for questioning, the
-boys convinced the police they
were innocent tourists and were
subsequently released. A

tion the three headed for White
Plains where they rented a trailer
and started out to meet their
companions with the mule. " '
And Then the Army
The army, however, was not
inactive all this time. Alert resi-
dents, noticing’ a good deal of
confusion in the area, had notiﬁed
the local, state, and military po-
lice, all of whom were on the
alert and setting up roadblocks.
The group was apprehended
just as they were loading Pon-
cho into the trailer and taken
to the military police barracks.
Here they were kept from
8:30 a.m. to 3 p.m., Tuesday.
They were released and reunit-
ed with Poncho for newspaper
pictures and interviews. The
radio tape recorded at the time
will be played on NBC’s “Mon-
itor” sometime this weekend.
During”their conﬁnement at the
barracks, the boys were served

A (See Letter) L

The suggestion by Dr. Newman, representing his ,Uni-
versity Senate Committee’s opinion, that more students take
advanced standing examinations is a valid one.‘ k

However, one rather important problem existsein this
matter. The costs for said examination are so ‘high as to ‘be
prohibitive. They are $10 per credit sought, to be paid the disease, ,only 1% to the identiﬁcation" of the

Suppose a student wanted the maximum "or a year’s
credit in a lab science, normally 4 credits per semester.'He
would have topay $80 with no assurance that he would pass

the test, yet great assurance that his $80 would

a It is our contention that this makes the conditions too
rigorous under which a person may take an advanced stand-

Another problem in the»progra‘m_is that some depart-
‘ments do not encouragethe students to take these tests. ,

_ example of,a man who was. 107

vs

By Millard Amdur.
Dr. Paul Dudley Whiteispoke to a capacity
audience in the“ School of the Health Professions
auditorium on Monday. The occasion was ‘the third

‘annual Phi Rho Sigma lecture. .
, ~His subject was “Candidates for Disease,

‘9!

on

which he concentratedfully “for
the ﬁrst time?’ '

The noted heart- surgeon.
stressed that it is equally im-
portant, if not more important. to
deal with the person as much as
the disease. ‘

-There is 'need "for studying
health. He frequently’ cited the

years, old at the time -of his
death earlier this year. ~

White mentioned ‘thait he ﬁrst met the gentle-
man in 1950, “not as a patient.” One of White’s
friends thought it would "‘do him good” to see a

healthy man 100 years old. ‘

He died of pneumonia at 107, “not of old age.”
White noted" that he died. of the disease 105 years

after hejd had it the ﬁrst time at the age of two.-

This man had suffered such diseases as typhoid
fever and, at the age of 106, was dragged by a
-taxi cab but-~his health was surprisingly good.

The heart specialist believes that,’ aside from
the fact the -elderly gent1eman’s doctor was on
vacation at the time, he might have lived another
10 years.  _ ' ’
The Art of Staying Healthy / _

« White questions what it is that kept that man
hea1thy.'He asserts that we should begin studying
health after so many years of studying "disease,

Our progress thus farvwith “prevention of dis-
.eases,”' has dealt 99% ‘of thetime with control of

host, “the candidate.” _‘ 1
_ White believes, with some justiﬁcation, that itis
ridiculous to be forced to_ apply protective measures

for various diseases so generally when “so few.

need-' protection.”
Rlieumatic fever, “which. may come without

rheumatism and without fever,-” will attack only

five percent of thepeople after exposure to the
hemolytic streptococcus. ,

White related‘ to the audience of ‘physicians,
health professiohs students, and undergraduates
that he recently“ published a paper entitled “Genes

and ‘Cardiovascular Disease.”
The major point of this paper is to a certain
extent genes inﬂuence development of cardiovascu-
lar disease. The problem is that"it'is “difﬁcult to
tell ‘what proportion is due to the genetic aspect,
what to the‘ environmental.” .
Theidoctor believes that further studies of gene
action in disease, what predispositions are 
herited, is very necessary. it - .
The same principle which dictates ‘that some
people are more likely to have autopaccidents than
others, White contends, applies to cardio-vascular
diseases as well. V ‘ ' A
The Orator Doctor ,
White spokein the smooth,“ relaxed, polished
tones of a man, accustomed to lecturing and public
speaking. He held the audience interest, not only
with his subject matter, -but by means of the sense
of humor with which he treated some of his topics.
' In speaking of physical activity or lack of it as
' a possible cause of predisposition toward disease,
e.g. coronary heart disease, he mentioned that golf

is not a vigorous enough sport unless great many _

holes are played without the use of a cart.

.He didn't mention President Eisenhower, but the ‘

laughter of the audience indicated their associa-
tion of the sage words on golf with our President’s
‘rounds.

.One factor promoting coronary heart disease in
our “young men” is that they drink too much milk,

according to the specialist; milk loaded with cream .

or “poison” in every drop. He emphasized that this

 only applies to‘some people. -

White presented a ﬁve-point plan, which might
, help in the positive practice of health.

First of all, we must stimulate'the training of
more “human geneticists.” Families must begin to
record again family trees indicating cause and
time of death and diseases of the individual in-
volved. ,

Practicing physicians should keep more accurate V
records of all diseases of their patients, the ages ,

they contracted them, et al. —
The personof the patient should be studied in
more detailf And, ﬁnally, we must “utilize pro-
grams to protect candidates for disease.”
Dr. White interlaced in his talk two quotations
from Shakespeare, and very apt ones at that. One

of them seems appropriate to close this column;

“Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,
Which we ascribe to Heaven.”

grams of superior students, and of_
avoiding duplication of work, the
Senate of the University of Pitts-
burgh recommends to all schools
and departments of the University
the following. A
. 1. That the advanced Place-'
ment Program of the. College
Entrance Examination Board be
fully supported in all under-
graduate schools, and '
2._ That the provisions for
credit by examination contained
in the catalogs of the under-
graduate schools be publicized
by all av\ailable means and fully
implemented in line with the
above objectives. .

The first of these recommenda-
tions is not a matter for student
action, but the second one is. Very
few students realize that it is not
always necessary for them to take
a “course” in order to become
educated, nor-even for them to get
credit toward a University degree.

The current Announcement of
The College for 1958-59, on page
50, carries a ‘statement headed

“Advanced Standing Examina-

tions” which explains how a stu-
dent can get credit for something
which he has learned in some way_
other than taking a course.
Other undergraduate bulletins
carry the same statement. ‘There
is a fee, of course, and a limit on
the amount of credit gained; but
‘the opportunity is there. '

» tics of higher education, with the

“time served” aspects of getting
a pollege degree, with the rigid
requirements- of “course-credit”
procedure.

We favor any practicable pro-
posal for achieving the objectives
stated in our resolutions, and we
feel that use of the credit-by— ex-
amination provision is practicable.

We were startled to find that
there were only 15 examinations
for credit given in the entire Uni-
versity. '

We are pleased by "the T many
trends t o w a r d individualizing
such as the
CEEB Advance Placement Pro-
gram and the current practice in
mathematics and modern langu-
ages of placing students in classes
appropriate to their knowledge.

We feel that there must be many
students who have studied various
subjects informally, or have work-
ed in asituation giving them ex-
pert acquaintance with a ﬁeld,
who might beneﬁt by this pro-

vision. We _hope they will take

advantage of it.. ‘

that the United Independent party,

mounted on a white horse, is seek-

ing to slay this monster.

Does the really think that the
Pitt student is unaware of the
tyrannical control the William
Pitt Debate Union exercises over
the U.I. party? Does he think that

no one knows that the U.I. slat-
ing was done by a committee of "

four?

Any party welcomes support.”

Mr. Turner implies that support
from fraternities and sororities is
a wicked and evil thing. We of the
A.C. Party know that the Pitt stu-

dent is intelligent enough to real- '

ize that a person’s leadership abil-

ity has nothing to do with his 1

Greek affiliation.

, The results of the election prove
that- the entire student body
realizes. this. And speaking of the
election’ results, I wonder if Mr.
Turner’s debate associates are not
thinking that a “renunciation of
leadership” might be beneﬁcial to

their party. Good luck, Mr. Turn-

er, and keep punching.

The problem‘ was not that
Marty had fallen in love with
a shirt. After ‘all, he ‘was
9. Philosophy major.
_ The trouble was . . . Marty
was in love with two shirts.
With Shirt N o. 1, the. Van
Heusen Century, the serious
Marty spent hours in heaven-
. ly bliss. “He worshipped the
revolutionary soft collar that
won't wrinkle ever. It was
Century’s one-piece construc-
tion that drove him wild.
(Other collars never did any-
thing for our boy Marty, ex-
cept wrinkle madly. You see,
other collars are. three pieces,
fused or sewn together.)
With Shirt No. 2, the»amaz-
Ing Van Heusen “Vantage,"
the gay, frivolous Marty lived

the life of carefree abandon.Ha

could wear it and wear it-
wash it—drip—dry it, or have
it tumble-dried automatically
-—-and wear it again in a matter
of hours. It was the most mon-
.ey-saving love he ever had.
But when Marty was with
one shirt, he missed the other.
It was terrible. Like so many
others with the same problem,
‘Marty wrote to us. _And'so
it came to pass that the Van
Heusen “Century-Vantage"
was born. This shirt combined
theadvantagesof each intoono
great shirt—a wash and wear,
no—iron, all cotton broadcloth
shirt with the soft collar that
won't wrinkle ever! And just
$5! Have you a problem?
