Dr. Bill Nunn, associate director
of admissions, will run a workshop
in cooperation with Audrey Collins
from the Office of Admissions and
Student Aid. Their workshop,
according to Nunn, is to help black
students “better realize what kind of
aid is available and the importance
of the timetable for applying for that
aid.”

Nunn believes that a possible dia-
logue between students and admin-
istration will come from the various
workshops and will help to enhance
the quality and kind of services
available to black students. In the
case of the Office of Admissions and
Student Aid, Nunn said that the dis-
tribution of informational bro-
chures to formerly neglected areas
might help the survival rate of black
students at Pitt.

The Pitt News, Wednesday, January 30, 1985

GENEVA (UPI) — Delegates to
the OPEC oil ministers’ conference
in Geneva, Switzerland, may be
ready to scrap the cartel’s $29/ barrel
base price, but first they need per-
mission from their heads of state to
put the new policy into force. .

The ministers have been meeting
in emergency sessions in Geneva
since Monday on what to do to bring
their prices in line with the world
market.

Delegates said most of the minis-
ters agreed to replace the benchmark
prices with a new range of prices for
different grades -— a narrower range
than before. .

Oil analysts have said OPEC
would have to cut its average prices
about $1 per barrel to be competitive
in the world market. As it is, most
producers of OPEC’s top-quality oil
-— the $29 light crude — sell it at
discounted prices.

WASHINGTON (UPI) — The

Senate was scheduled to vote yester-
day on whether James Baker should
be treasury secretary. It was consid-
ered a certainty that he would be
confirmed.
_ Less certain is what will happen to
White House Council Edwin Meese.
The Senate Judiciary Committee
began hearings today on his nomi-
nation as attorney general.

A critic, Ohio Democratic senator
Howard Metzenbaum, said Meese
was involved in a “sham transac-
tion" to disguise a $10,000 payment
his lawyer and the Justice Depart-
ment told him was probably unlaw-
ful. He said of Meese, “He has failed
to meet the standard we must apply
for the nation's most powerful law
enforcement officer.”

   

Name

Remember
Add/ Drop?

Meese was nominated last year,
but proceedings were delayed while
a special prosecutor checked into his
financial dealings.

Meese told the committee that the
prosecutor’s report found he had
“conducted himself in accordance to
the ethical as well as the legal stand-
ards of behavior for public
officials.”

Once Baker, the current White
House chief of staff, is confirmed, he
is to switch jobs with the current
treasury secretary, Donald Regan.

WASHINGTON (UPI) — Presi-
dent Reagan has given up his fight to
abolish the education department —
for now at least. In a letter to Sena-
tor Orrin Hatch, Reagan‘ said he
does not intend to recommend that
the department be eliminated “at
this time."

When Reagan took office in 1981,
he said abolishing the agency was a
major goal. In his letter to the Utah
Republican, he conceded that his
proposal has little support in
Congress. _

Connecticut Senator Lowell
Weicker said Reagan’s letter means
that William Bennett, nominated to
be education secretary, can concern
himself with improving the depart-
ment. In confirmation hearings on
Monday, Bennett said he did not
know if it should be closed.

(UPI) — State and- local police
yesterday raided a Montgomery
county home, seizing 10 pounds of
methamphatamine and arresting the
home‘s occupant.

Undercover investigators seized
what is described as 10 pounds of

Newsbriefs

“solid rocklike” methamphetamine
with a street value of about
$819,000, a small quantity of mari-
juana, a scale and various drug
paraphernalia.

State police said they arrested 24-
year-old Michael Levering of the
500 block of Ford Street, Consho-
hocken. He is charged with posses-
sion of methamphetamine and
possession with intent to distribute.

If convicted, Levering could face
up to 10 years in jail and a $100,000
fine.

He was sent to Montgomery
County Prison in lieu of a $100,000
bail.

(UPI) — An expert witness yester-
day testified against a doctor
accused of withholding medical care
from a 32-week-old aborted fetus.
Dr. Joseph Melnick is charged with
murder and aborting a viable fetus
in an incident last September at
West Park Hospital. Melnick per-
formed an abortion on a 13-year-old
girl by giving her a labor-inducing
drug.

Hospital staff members testified
that they saw the fetus gasp but Mel-
nick did nothing to save its life. It
was later determined that the female
fetus was 32 weeks old.

Obstetrician Ronald Bolocnesee
said there is no question a fetus that
age can survive outside its mother’s
body. He said it needed oxygen and
warmth after the delivery.

Defense attorney Sheldon Albert
challenged him, saying Melnick
believed the fetus was 17 weeks old,
based on the mother’s statement and
his examination of the girl.

Municipal Court Judge Michael
Conroy must decide whether there is

enough evidence to hold Melnick for
trial. The defense has not yet pres-
ented its case.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (UPI) —-
The state senate appropriations
committee yesterday approved legis-
lation allocating an additional $3
million in federal funds to Pennsyl-
vania’s program to help low income
households pay their winter heating
bills.

Just a few hours prior to the
action by the senate panel, the
House of Representatives appropri-
ations committee OK’d a bill allo-
cating $25 million in state money to
the program.

The Public Welfare Department
earlier this month announced it was
no longer accepting regular applica-
tions for the aid because it had com-
mitted all the funds allocated for the
program except $12 million in an
emergency account.

Republican majority leader John
Stauffer, the sponsor of the senate’s
appropriations bill, said the money
in the emergency account and the
proposed additional $3 million is
enough to ensure that anyone need-
ing aid can get it.

Stauffer added that no person so
far has been denied help. But Demo-
cratic representative Charles Laugh-
lin disagrees. He is the sponsor of the
proposed $25 million house appro-
priation. Laughlin said his office has
been contacted by people turned
away by the Public Welfare
Department.

(UPI) — The health department is
being flooded with requests for birth

certificates of adoptees as the effec-
tive date of a new law blocking easy
access to the records draws closer.

The law, set to take effect Feb. 10,
prohibits the release of information
identifying an adoptee’s natural par-
ents without consent of the parents.

For about six years, adoptees over
18 and adoptive parents have been
able to identify an adoptee’s natural
parents by obtaining birth certifi-
cates from the health departments
division of vital records.

Charles Hardester, the division’s
director, said the agency is receiving
about 30 requests per day for birth
certificates, compared with about 30
per week before the new law was
passed.

Hardester said that three addi-
tional staff members have been
assigned to help handle the deluge of
letters. He also stated that requests
with postmarks dated through Feb.
9 will be honored. ‘

PHILADELPHIA (UPI) — A
Philadelphia judge has thrown out
the results of breathalizer tests
against ﬁve people accused of
drunken driving because he ruled
that the state failed to properly test
the devices.

Municipal Court Judge Joseph
McCabe said he based his ruling on
2 decision made by an Allegheny
Court judge. He ruled that the
breathalizer tests could not be used
as evidence’ because the machines
had not been properly calibrated as
required by law.

The cases have been continued for
30 days to allow the district attor-
ney’s office to appeal.

McCabe said the state changed its
regulations, effective earlier this
month, to provide for proper test-
ing. But he said the results of earlier
tests could probably be challenged.

NEW YORK (UPI) — Civil rights
lawyer William Kunstler and several
other attorneys said they willjoin in
filing a $100 million lawsuit against
New York subway gunman Bernard
Goetz. One ofthese lawyers, C. Ver-
non Mason, said the suit contends
that Goetz intentionally tried to kill
the four black teen-agers he shot on
Dec. 22 and that the shooting was
racially motivated.

One of Goetz’s victims, 19-year-
old Darrel Cabey, has been in a
coma for three weeks and took a
turn for the worse on Monday night.

Goetz may also face federal civil
rights charges in the shootings. A
U.S. attorney was scheduled to meet
with New York black leaders
yesterday.

WASHINGTON (UPI) —— The
Food and Drug Administration
announced yesterday that it has
approved a prescription pill for geni-
tal herpes.

FDA spokesman Michael Shaffer
emphasized that the pill is a new
form of a drug that has been used by
hospitals for nearly three years. He

also stressed that the drug is not a '

cure, it merely helps alleviate
symptoms.

The pill will be marketed under
the name Zovirax.

Herpes is a sexually transmitted
disease afflicting five to 20 million
Americans, and statistics show that
there are about 300,000 new herpes
cases each year.

_ Revenge. Everybody loves to get
it, but nobody likes to be a victim of
it. Revenge will be on the minds of
the. Pitt women’s basketball team
tonight when it hosts the Providence
Lady Friars at 7:30 p.m.

The Panthers will berout to avenge
a 71-69, double-overtime loss at the
hands of Providence on Jan. 2. Pitt’s
all-time ‘leading scorer, Jennifer
Bruce, will be looking to duplicate
the 32-point performance she gave
in Rhode Island nearly a month ago,
but it will not be easy.

Second-year Providence coach
Lynn Sheedy boasts some firepower
of her own, including the Big East
Player of the Week, Doris Sable.

Sable, a 5-6 sophomore, had 32
points and 1 1 assists in victories over
Syracuse and Georgetown last week.

Joining Sable will be 5-11 sopho-
more Mary Burke, the fourth lead-
ing scorer in the conference at 15.3

East’s leading rebounder. Junior
Joanie Powers and senior Sue

Pitt falls to Villanova

By Bob Travers
The Pitt News

At least it was an easy one to
watch. Unlike the previous two Pitt
losses, the Panthers never had the
chance to blow a lead in this one. It
was easier, but no less painful for a
Pitt fan. ,

Oh, it wasn’t official —- the shiny
new Palestra scoreboard read Vil-
lanova 70, Pitt 63 -~ but from Ed
Pinckney‘s first over-the-head slam
two minutes into the game, the out-
come was rarely in doubt. Panther
coach Roy Chipman said, “Basi-
cally, I thought we lost in the first
half. They shot the lights out and
they had a good night getting inside
on us, and when they didn’t get
inside, Swight and Wilbur hit from
outside.”

The Panthers trailed 36-26 at the
intermission. Villanova played a
solid if not spectacular game.
Indeed, the Wildcat cheerleaders
often elicited more crowd reaction
than the team, but the 5-2 Wildcats
didn’t need the glitz. Basic basket-
ball was more than enough to hand
the Panthers their fifth loss.

Villanova boss Rollie Massimino
was kind to the Panthers following
the game. “Pitt is a very, very tal-

if they are going to contend for the
conference championship.

ented team," he said. “A very good
team.

“They played good and we played
good. Tonight was a big win for us.
It was important to get this one after
the losses [on Sunday vs.
Maryland].”

In the second half, Pitt was able to
pull within ‘7 points of Villanova on
several occasions, but never any
closer. Every time the Panthers got
anything going offensively, a turn-
(Wet or missed shot would shift the
momentum back to Villanova, who
capitalized on almost every chance
Pitt gave them.

Keith Armstrong continued his
rollercoaster ride this season, turn-
ing in his best performance of the
year by scoring l3 points, several of
which were impressive slams over
the celebrated Pickney and Harold
Pressley. “I changed my attitude,”
the Pitt center said.

When asked to rate Villanova’s
front court against that of George-
town’s, he said: “They’rejust as good
but not as strong. Tonight, they were
collapsing on Charles Smith, and
that left me open.”

Still, Armstrong was not com-
pletely satisfied with his perform-
ance. “I would rather the team win
than have my best team game of the

year when we lose. Basketball is a
team sport, and we have to play
together as a team."

Last night's game is also quite a
change for Pitt freshman Charles

Smith, who after turning in five con- 3

secutive games in which he was
either Pitt’s leading scorer or top
rebounder, Smith was held to 12
points and six rebounds (still good
enough to lead the team in
rebounds).

It was Villanova’s intense pressure
that was the cause of Smith’s subpar
totals. For most of the game, he had
at least two Wildcats on him tighter
than his Pitt jersey. Smith admitted
that he should be getting used to the
pressure. “Yeah, they put a lot of
pressure on me tonight, but so did
Syracuse. I wasn't expecting it, but

it’s somethingl have to get used to.”-

Where Pitt's players are for the
most part young and inexperienced,
Villanova’s are seasoned veterans.
Pinckney, a senior, and Wilbur, a
junior, contributed most of the
Wildcats‘ points. Wilbur led all scor-
ers with 19 and Pinckney was second
with 15.

Rounding out Villanova’s front
line was another junior, Pressley,
who contributed seven points. “I
don’t think it was their inexperience.
They are a very talented team. Smith

‘ is only a freshman and Aiken is only

a sophomore.”

Hiring of Stobart starts new football season  

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

Pitt’s 1985 football season began
last Tuesday. Astonishing it
shouldn't be when weighed against
the notion that its preceding season
ended before September had.

Many will contend an offense
vanished even earlier than that. To
insure against any such recurrences

Press Box
Mounty bound

The Pitt men's track team heads to WVU for
a quad meet, with the Mountaineers being
their toughest competition.

(a dismal l6l yard passing average,
for one) Coach Foge Fazio demoted
one present assistant and replaced
him with an already displaced head
coach.

One week ago, offensive line
coach Joe Moore was relieved of an
offensive coordinator title now in
Chuck Stobart's festering clutches.
He is considered an offensive genius,
perhaps an overstatement given his

' pre-Utah days. From now until the

Sept. 7 opener against Purdue, the

former Ut_ah coach can do no wrong.
In the interim, he will pore over
game films, attend meetings ad
inﬁnitum and combine 20 years
worth of coaching experience with
player talent. I

But come Pitt's first possession,
Stobart will be measured against
successful predecessors Wally Eng-
lish, Joe Daniels and Joe Pendry.

“I want to take what Pitt's done
really well," Stobart said last week.
“Attacking the different defenses,

we’ll have a base offense with base
adjustments to go against any
defense. We'll throw the ball to the
tight end and run the fullback and
tailback. Then, from there, well
build in abilities of players.“

Until then, there’s only looking at
his ledger, the most recent pages
showing a 16- l 7- l , three-year record
with Utah. They are gilt-edged
leaves, testimony to an offensive
genius.

poses big threat

By Rich Md(enzie
The Pitt News

“They’re solid 15-point favorites,
but come Saturday, they have to line
up and beat us like any other team.
We're certainly not going to lie down
just because they walk onto the
track. We will certainly show up.”
These were the words of men's track
coach John Vasvary as he spoke of
West Virginia University and the
upcoming meet at Morgantown, in
which the University of Pittsburgh
will take on the Mountaineers, Kent
State and Cleveland State in a quad
meet this Saturday.

The Panthers will be trying to
improve on their successful per-
formance of a week ago when they
traveled to the Milrose Games in
New York City. Vasvary said that
the tearn got “New York.” He
explained, “We are a very young
team and some of the kids were in
awe of the meet, the city and some of
the runners. It is something that will
come with experience.”

‘Not many things went right for
the Panthers. One of their finest
runners, Lee McRae, stumbled in
one of his races. But these setbacks
do not take anything away from the
season the young Panther squad is
having, placing runners in IC4As
and the NCAAS, with the season not
quite half over.

The West Virginia squad, which
will pose the biggest threat to the
Panthers, are led by a fine number of

ing in the fall. Some of the key
match-ups include Tim Manes
against WVU’s Doug Molnar in the
800 meters, Pitt's Alan Laws, Jesse
Mikel] and Dorrell Hilliman against
the Mair brothers ofWVU in sprints
and middle distances.

In what may be the most exciting
and best match-up of the day, Pitt's
talented freshman, Lee McRae, will
face Thomas Jefferson of Kent
State, who was the Silver Medal
winner in the 1984 Summer Olym-
pics. If McRae is victorious, it would
be a major upset.

In the longer distance races, Rod-
ney Giles and Scott Abel will run
against Kenyan Gene Paul Nadyi-
senga of West Virginia in the 1,000
meters, and Bob Weiner and Joe
Daniels will face WVU’s Joseph
Wangugi in the 1,500 meters.

The meet will be scored by the
5-3-2-l system, with the top four fin-
ishers scoring in each event.
Although Kent State doesn’t look to
challenge Pitt or WVU for the over-
all title, Vasvary said that they will
probably be the deciding factor in
which school comes away
victorious.

“They are very strong in the events
in which we are the weakest — the
field events — simply because we
don’t have anyone to compete in
most of the field events,” he said.
“Kent State will probably score high
1-2 in the long jump, 1-2-3 in the
shot put and high in the high jump,
and could also be a factor as to who
scores what in the track events, as
they could play a direct effect on
who finishes in which positions. It
should be an interesting meet, and I
feel that We will run well."

When Digger Phelps and Wal-
ter Byers, the president of the
NCAA, talk about athletes
receiving wheelbarrows full of
money these days, they are
touching on what I think is one
of greatest ironies in collegiate
history.

By being too amateur, so
excessively amateur, the NCAA
has gone a long way in all but
eliminating the true amateur ath-

Athletes deserving

lete. What they have done is
create a Pandora’s Box, where
laws are broken, in my opinion,
only because those laws are too
strict.

The problem of money for col-
lege athletes is something that
has to be faced, and the sooner
the better, in an up-front,
straightforward way by the
NCAA and the presidents of our
universities.

The solution is to make sure
the athlete receives the monies he
needs to survive in the proper
way, as part of his scholarship.
That would eliminate the need

“We feel we’ve done a great job
developing them," Stobart said of
former Wolverines Don Moore-
head, Denny Franklin and Rick
Leach. 1

Statistics fail to cushion Stobart’s
words. Although Franklin lasted a
year as a Detroit Lion wide receiver,
he and Moorehead were pro duds.
Leach would have been, too (despite
4,284 yards passing and 48 TDs)
except that he shunned pro ball for
baseball. After a Detroit stay, he’s

Pitt’s new offensive coach

now a Toronto utility infielder.

Stobart refuses to speculate what
the former genius of Utah will make
of seniors John Congemi and Chris
Jelic or newcomer Joe Felitsky.

“I've heard a lot about them,” he
said. “I learned a long time ago you
can only do what your quarterback
can do and he will dictate what you
can do.”

Roughly seven months remain
before Stobart can smooth the
ragged edges.

rebuilding year. A multitude of fifth-
year players, massive graduations of
starters and dolops of JUCO
transfers scarred his first two Utah
campaigns.

“There was no concrete base. This
past year was the first time we had a
football team of the future,"Stobart
said. “We ranked well because I got
a quarterback transfer from
Purdue.”

Mark Stevens has departed, but
not before passing for 3,875 yards
and 46 TDs and rushing for 986
yards — all in two years.

“Like offenses at Nebraska, Flor-
ida State and Virginia, we really
strived to keep a ‘balance between
the run and pass,” Stobart added.

Perhaps his biggest inﬂuence has

Don’t Miss this Programll
You Can Set the Course for the future!

By Jim Brueckner
The Pitt News

I am one ofthe great sports fans of
the world. Like many other sports
junkies, ifthey keep score, I watch it.
My cable service carries USA,
WOR, WTBS and God’s greatest
gift to mankind, ESPN.‘ I just love
Australian football.

But even as much as I love sports,
some things still irritate me.

This idea came to me as I was
watching the Pitt-Georgetown
game. (Sorry, I wasn’t there, but it
was a big day for sports on TV and I
didn’t want to miss any of the
action.) When the Panthers scored
their first points of the game, fans
began to throw streamers out onto
the floor. Immediately the
announcers began their “this does
not belong” speech. Why?

This is supposed to be a game, not
a funeral. It is supposed to befun. I
agree that they should not continue
to do this throughout the game, but
why not let them have some fun? It
would be different if they were
throwing grenades.

The absolute worst rule in the his-
tory of organized sports is the rule
banning premeditated celebration in
the NFL. What’s next, “No cheering
by the fans?” Give me a break! They

The Pitt News, Wednesday, January 30, 1985

Where has all the fun gone in hoops?

say that this dancing bothers oppos-
ing players. Talk about sore losers! I
would expect little leagues to be able
to handle a similiar situation.

First, they complain that nobody
plays for the mere fun of the game
anymore. Then when a few players
start having fun, they are told that
this is not “professional activity.”

Bring back the “Fun Bunch” and
the “California Quake.”

Another thing that really bothers
me is when people watch a great
game like hockey just for the fights.
But not watching it for the same rea-
son is even worse. One hockey rule
that ought to be changed: I think it
would be a great idea that if a team
scores a shorthanded goal, they
should get their man out of the
penalty box.

Somebody please tell me that in
the near future, college football’s
national champion will be decided
on the field the way that it is in col-
lege basketball.

Now somebody please tell me why

A we have polls for college basketball

when the championship is decided
on the court. I guess it is so the TV
people can draw a bigger crowd with
a 1-2 showdown like St. John’s and
Georgetown.

Speaking of polls in general, if a
team is ranked 18th and loses to the
fourth-ranked team by a mere two
points, should they notjump signifi-
cantly in the rankings? By the same

Viewpoint

token, should that fourth-ranked
team drop a little for its poor perfor-
mance? Let's look at who beats
whom, not by how much. Beating
Hoboken State by 44 points“is not
too impressive in my book. How
about yours?

Why shouldn’t everyone recog-
nize his own champion? That is how
boxing is currently run. We now
have the WBC, WBA, IBF, USBA,
NABF, ESPN and European Cham-
pionships. Despite this nuisance,
boxing remains my favorite sport.
What bothers me more than any-
thing in the world of sports are the
“ban boxing” fanatics.

Where do these people get their
information? They say that too
many young‘ fighters are getting
killed and that something must be
done. There are many things more
dangerous in the world than boxing.
In fact, boxing is ranked fifth in
sports-related fatalities. Did you
know that more jockeys are killed
every year than boxers? Okay, let’s
ban the Kentucky Derby. Seriously,
let’s ban auto racing. Talk about
danger? Tell me that people go to

those races to see great driving.

Did you know that four times as
many players are killed every year in
football ‘ as in boxing? Surprise!
More players are killed every year
playing baseball than any other
sport. _

In boxing, we have had the unfor-
tunate tragedy of having some top-
ranked fighters killed. It really
bothers me when these “ban boxing"
people put a value on a person on
how well he is known. Ifa 17-year-
old kid is killed playing any other
sport, why is that not as tragic as
when a well-known boxer is killed?
They are both human beings and
both have family and friends who
love them. A few months later, the
public will have all but forgotten
about them.

If you want to argue the “punch
drunk” theory, forget about it. Have
you noticed that most of those fight-
ers are the older fighters who fought
without the benefit of modern medi-
cal technology? Many of them, if
fighting today, would not have been
allowed back into the ring as many
times as they were. Muhammad All
has just been diagnosed as the victim
of a disease, not punch drunk.

Ban boxing? No way. Besides,
boxing has helped to straighten out
a lot of would-be juvenile
delinquents.

One thing that should be banned
is artificial turf. It has proven to be

page 15

more trouble than it's worth. It has
all but ended the career ofthe Expos’
outfielder Andre Dawson, who used
to be the game’s best player.

Artificial turf does not belong in
football, either. Who wants to play
an entire football game without get-
ting dirty? Baseball was meant to be
played out in a country field, not in
the living room.

Speaking of baseball, today’s
players are taking an exciting game
and‘ turning it into a yawner. They
take forever wandering around in
between innings and in between
pitches and are far too casual about
everything. »We need more players
like Pete Rose. He won't be around
forever  or will he?

Who was the genius who sug-
gested a shot clock in college basket-
ball that gets turned off for the last
four minutes? This is the very time
for which it was first proposed.
Thank God the Big East had the
sense to notice this crazy rule. Now it
would be nice if all of college basket-
ball could get together on the shot
clock and the three-point shot.

The worst thing that ever hap-
pened to baseball and football (next
to turf) is domes. Somebody please
get rid of them. Where are terrorists
when you need them?

Believe it or not, I miss Howard

.Cosell.

Harris measures up

Not all collegiate athletes fit the
typical stereotype. Sophomore
Jason Harris of Pitt’s men’s track
squad is one person who does not
spend his time in “Rocks for Jocks"
or repeating Japanese Films. Jason
is a pre-law major and a perfect
example of the student athlete.

“I came to Pitt because I thought
it was a school of both academic and
athletic excellence," stated Harris,
who has expectations of attending
law school and aspires to a position
in corporate law.

Harris takes his academic exper-
tise to the track with him, and is
constantly trying to learn new ways
to improve his performance.

“Jason is constantly learning,’
said Coach John Vasvary. “He ques-
tioned himself a lot last year. But he
has come back and is doing well this
season.”

To say that Harris is doing well

9

this season is an understatement. He
has qualified for the IC4A Cham-
pionships, to be held March 2 in
Princeton, N.J. He will compete in
the 50-yard high hurdles.

Harris drives himself hard, and
this shows in his performance on the
track. “Competition motivates me
to better myself,” explained Harris.
“If you did well in the past, then it is
something to live up to. You have to
uphold that.”

Though Harris drives hard for
personal success, his main thrust is
for the team. He is a member of the
shuttle hurdle relay team which set a
school record last year, and has high
expectations for himself and this
year’s team.

“My goal is that the team will do
well,” stated Harris. “I would like to
make it to the NCAAS, but mostly I
am wishing that the team has a good

92

year.

stopped athletes’ being able to
get jobs and work at Christmas
and Easter. Now a lot of them

’ can’t work in summer because

they go to summer school. So
what you got now in colleges is a
group of talented athletes, who

legally can’t have enough money A

in their pockets to go out for a
hero sandwich. .

The problem is that Walter
Byers and the ‘presidents and
faculties of these universities

have never had to live on the level
of most of these kids. Most of
them are financially secure.
They're not in the minus pool
like a lot of the athletes. They
say: “Hey, we‘re giving the kid
his room, board and tuition.
What else does he want?” What
they don't realize is that when
you recruit an inner city kid,

I most times he doesn’t even have a

piece of luggage to put his clothes
in so he can come to school.

Let’s use a little common sense
here. Let’s make sure they have
that piece of luggage to put their
clothes in. Otherwise, someone
else will, and that’s where the ille-
galities start.

The problem that’s surfacing
from all this —— and we‘re only
seeing the tip of the iceberg on
this right now — is the agents

who are taking kids right out of
high school and lending them
money in return for their being
guaranteed the representation of

ithe kids when they get out of
college.

The average first—round draft
choice in the NBA or NFL gets a
three-year contract worth a min-
imum of $1 million. Ten percent
of$l million is $100,000. So fora
$100-a-month investment, which
comes out to $3,600 forthe ath-
lete’s four years at college, the
agent gets back $100,000.

What the NCAA and the uni-
versities should do is quit worry-
ing about some kid getting a
T-shirt and instead be practical
and say, hey, these athletes are
raising millions ofdollars for the
school. Millions in gate receipts,
TV—radio, not to mention gifts

from some alumni who are
happy because Jockstrap U.
went to a bowl game.

For all that, $100 a month
seems a pretty small price to pay.
Two things I think must be done.
First, the college athlete must be
allowed to receive the $100 a
month spending as part of his
scholarship. Second, there ought
to be a trust fund set up at each
school, so a certain percentage of
the monies made are guaranteed
to the athletes after they com-
plete their four years.

The money is there. The Uni-
versity of Michigan, for exam-
ple, seats 102,000 for every
football game, plus concessions.
Any school whose team goes to
the NCAA Basketball Tourney

i_ gets $130,000 for the first round.
The winner of the tournament

probably made $800,000 last
year.

All l’m saying is that we
should give some of this back to
the athletes, who make it all
happen.

So come on all you guys in
Shawnee Mission and all those
vine-covered ivory towers out
there. Let's do what’s right. Let’s
not put these kids in the position
that they have to be pimping
around to get a free meal at the
athletic club or signing their
future away so they can send
their folks a teapot for
Christmas.

A shot
against
cancer?

 

One day the scariest
thing about cancer may be
the needle that makes you
immune to it.

The theory: build up the
body's defense to fight off
the disease naturally.

Already, scientists are
working on mechanisms to
makethe body reject cancer.

And the promise for the
future is staggering.

Wouldn’t you feel good
knowing you contributed to
the research?

Please contribute. Your‘
dollars will help further all
our cancer research.

We want to wipe out can-
cer in your lifetime.
