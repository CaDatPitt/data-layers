By Laurie Lehosky
Staff Writer

It will be a good time. Clowns,
candy, ice cream, and fun and
games are a small part of this
year’s festivities at the University
of Pittsburgh’s Hand-in-Hand
festival.

The festival, a subsidiary of
United Way, is open to all
physically and mentally
handicapped children who live
in the western Pennsylvania area
and are between the ages of
three" and 21. It is a student-
organized event planned and
prepared by the senior staff, 35

Worst

of water
crisis over
for campus

By Jeﬁ Tatusko
Staff Writer

Pitt has weathered the worst of
the storm.

When 75,600 gallons of a
petroleum by-product spilled into
the Allegheny River, Facilities
Management Director Tom

Hussey feared that Pitt would ‘
have tobegin conserving water. _

But according to Hussey, the
emergency seems to be over.

“Pitt won’t have to curtail the
use of water,” he said. “We
originally thought that we would
have to cut down, but that doesn’t
seem to be the case. I think that
the worst is over.”

Hussey I said that

communication between
departments in the university was
a key to managing the crisis,
especially Public Safety. “Facilities
Management worked very well
alongside Public Safety,” he said.
“I would like to thank them for
their cooperation in this matter."
He added that Public Safety had a
special hotline set up to take
phone calls in case the situation
had worsened.

But Hussey also had praise for
other groups as well. “We worked
very well with both the housing
and food services, " he said. “Mary
Ann Aug [of University Relations]
did an excellent job as liason
between the different groups, and
I thank her.”

Hussey said that the voluntary
conservation order has been
cancelled. That means that all
washing machines in the
dormitories will soon be turned
back on, and water pressure will
return to normal.

  

involved students who devote a
year to produce five successful
hours of fun and games to create
smiles on the faces of these
children.

The Hand-in-Hand festival is
on Saturday, April 7 from 11 a.m.
to 4 p.m. in the lower level of
Forbes Quadrangle. This year
marks Pitt’s 12th annual festival,

0 and the theme is “Put a Little Love

in Your Heart.”

The theme is an understatement
for what senior Jennie Gatto’s
expectations are for the children
this Saturday.

“If you haven’t ever attended a
Hand-in—Hand festival, you can’t

appreciate or understand what
the festival does for the children.
Their eyes light up when they
see the clowns," said Gatto, co-
coordinator of the event.

She added, “It is a special day

for the children. It is a day of fun ,

that they normally do not get. I
encourage everyone to get
involved.”

According to co-coordinator
Ken Turner, a Pitt junior,
approximately 400 handicapped
children will attend the festival.
Turner expects 1,000 people to
attend the festival. Each child is
paired with a Pitt student, a one-
on-one volunteer who

accompanies the child for the
entire event.

One-on-one volunteers are not
the only type of volunteers at the
festival. Facilitators are trained in

CPR and seizure management; ‘

clowns are there to make smiling
faces, and there are also general
volunteers to set up, clean- up
and organize the festival. A
professional medical staff will be
present in caseof any accidents.

Presently, there are
approximately 200 students who
have applied to be volunteers.
150 more are needed, according

to Turner. \

Turner encourages anyone

 

Hand-in-Hand reaches out to handicapped

interested in beinga volunteer to
apply. Applications are available
at the William Pitt Union
Information Desk and in the
Towers Lobby.

“We do educate our volunteers

as to what they need to know for
the festival. We also inform them
what to do if an accident [should]
happen,” said Turner.
Gatto-said it is well worth the
time and effort to volunteer. .

“I truly believe the children
come and enjoy their day. For
one day, the child lives the life of
the college student. They can see
life in a new light,” she said. ’ I

Allocations Chair Gil Borok is honored

on the Walk of Fame.

SGB chair named
Senior of tbe Year

By Katie Malaspina ,
Staff Writer —

Senior Gil Borok will leave his mark on this university in stone.
As the 1990 Omicron Delta Kappa “Senior of the Year,” Borok
joins 78 previous honorees whose names have been engraved
in the sidewalk between the Cathedral of Learning and Heinz

Chapel.

Borok, given this award at the Honors Convocation on March
14, said it was “the nicest thing the university could havegiven

me.

Each year, one senior receives this honor based upon “intelligent
leadership, personal integrity and intellectual honesty” as is
stated in the creed at the beginning. of the sidewalk. ‘The
awardee can be any college senior who fulfills the standards set
up by the selections committee.

Borok, currently the chairperson of the Allocations Committee
for the Student Government Board, maintains a 3.7 GPA as a
business and economics major. He is a member of Delta Tau
Delta fraternity and former president of Order of Omega, a
prestigious Greek honorary society.

“I find [that being involved] is very self-satisfying. I get much
more out of being involved in extracurricular activities than
[being involved] purely with academics,” said Borok.

When asked who had inﬂuenced him most at Pitt, Borok said,
“Dean Mary Briscoe, because I respect her a lot for all the work
she's done in CAS and [I1-served on her advisory council [CA5

Council to the Dean].

Before coming to Pitt, Borok attended Herzlia High School in
Cape Town, South Africa. Borok now lives on campus as a

Ofﬁcial responds to ROTC-Gay situation

The February 20, 1990 issue of
The Pitt News included a story
about the discrimination of the
Reserve Officers’ Training Corps
against gays and lesbians.
Considering Pitt’s anti-
discrimination policy which was
amended in 1988 to include
“sexual orientation” the ROTC
appears to be operating beyond
the guidelines desginated by the
university. Yesterday morning, a
meeting between Pitt’s senior
administrators yielded the
following insights, as reported to
Jennifer Calabrese and Scot Ross
of The Pitt News, by Associate
Provost Jack L. Daniel. The

following conversation has been
edited in places for spatial
considerations.
0 O 0

Jack Daniel: We have an
afﬁrmative—action policy; you
know what it is, right? And it says
clearly that we are not going to
discriminate, and it lists things —
that includes homosexuality. The
policy as it is written relates
speciﬁcally to Pitt’s faculty, Pitt’s
staff and Pitt’s students. In short,
it is not this abstract thing called
the university. No one who is a
Pitt employee (staff, faculty,
students) is to violate this policy.
There is one difference that we

have discussed today that has
come up in that the policy we
have does not govern a number
of organizations, businesses,
religious groups [and] government
agencies with whom the
university, in fact, does business.
So for example, the university
interacts with a number of
religious groups. I don’t want to
name a particular religious group,
but I know that there are certain
religious groups who will tell
their members who they should
marry and who they should not,
and if you look at what they say
—— let me ask you -—- can you
think of any widespread religious

group here in this country that
has policies about who should
marry who?

The Pitt News: Irish Catholic?

JD: A good Irish Catholic
should marry whom? Should
they marry a jew? ,

TPN: No, they should marry
another good Irish Catholic.

JD: They should marry another
good Irish Catholic, right’ Now is
that: if the Irish Catholics say and
recommend marriage [explicitly].
to Irish Catholics? Or [is it] if a
member of the Jewish faith says
one should marry Jews or right
down the line, you can plug in

whomever you want One of the points that was made
earlier today was: ‘Look, we can't stop doing business
with the Catholic Church because the Catholic Church
recommends [marriage to other Catholics], and in a sense,
that is a form of religious discrimination,’ and so and on
and on. Yeah, we interact formally at this university with
a lot of organizations, private, governmental, religious
groups that, within what they do in their organizations,
some of what they do could be perceived as discriminatory,
and we’re not going to stop interacting with all of these
people because of that, and the policy of the university
is not a policy to govern what religious groups do, [or]
what the government does. The policy governs the
members of the university.

TPN: We’re questioning the parallel of the relationship
between the university and the Irish Catholic Church and
between the university and the ROTC. But, our ROTC
contact said that in military science, people have to be
given the rank of professor to work at the university. So
it’s not as if they’re making some sort of business
arrangement. They’re here at the university teaching
classes; they’re using university offices [and] scholarship
money. Is that the same sort of thing that the university
is talking about, or is it different?

JD: Yes, it’s different, but if there is a difference, the Irish
Catholic Church is a private entity. The difference comes
about in how the university justifies it in this case. We
justify it in the context of this being a public university,
and then secondly, we grab the obvious importance of

the Department of Defense in the life of this nation and
in the importance of officers in the military, and this is a
major way in which they are trained, and the view that
the university has a responsibility as a public institution
both to the largest society as well as [to] the students who
want that educational alternative.

TPN: Shouldn't this have been taken into account before

the university decided to pass the sexual-orientation
clause? ’
JD: First of all, the answer is yes, it should have been
taken into consideration. There's no doubt about that;
But what are you asking aside from that? Yes, it should
have been taken into consideration. Should we go on and
say what we said? Yes, I think so. I think the university
has a responsibility regardless of what the Supreme Court
has said [and] regardless of what the Department of
Defense has said. When we talk about an arts-and-
sciences education, we do not talk about justgaining
facts. We talk about the value of it having to do with the
humanities and the values and so forth. The university is
a place of ideas and values. And the university has [a]
leadership role in that kind of thing.

Officers’ Training Corps unit shall
be notiﬁed that commencing with
the next school year no new
inputs will be made and the unit
will be disestablished as the
remaining classes complete the
program." That seems like the
biggest contradiction I have ever
heard in my entire life, because
the ROTC is saying 'if you
discriminate against race, national
origin, color, creed, we're going
to take our things away,‘ but now
on the other side, Pitt says, 'You
can't [discriminate against
homosexualsl' and Pitt's backing
down from it basically.

JD: I guess I'm not sure of where
you're trying to go. I doubt that
anyone can rationally contest the
obvious contradiction between
the University of Pittsburgh's
policy about discrimination and
as it applies itself and the policies
that the Department of Defense
has with regard to homosexuals.
But given that, tell me where you
are trying to go.

TPN: The problem is Pitt as an
established public institution is
here. Pitt was here before the
ROTC was at Pitt. Pitt was here
one hundred and seventy—some
years before the ROTC. Why now
does Pitt have to compromise
because of the ROTC? They
discriminate against
homosexuals, that's all there is to
it.

JD: Tell me how you see Pitt ﬁt in
the contradiction discriminating

Tl'OlTI

against homosexuals.

TPN: They are giving money.
Money goes to this organization
from Pitt. The ROTC's
discriminating; therefore, Pitt's
supporting the discrimination.
JD: Now you might think this is
unfair, but does money go from
Pitt to ROTC, or does money go
from Jack Daniel's taxes to Pitt to
the ROTC? You're sort of painting
Pitt as a private enterprise and
not as a public enterprise.

TPN: As a public institution, Pitt
did not have to have ROTC. As a
public institution Pitt passed the
sexual orientation clause.

JD: As a public institution Pitt
doesn't have to have a business
program.

TPN: But the business program
isn't discriminating against certain
sectors of the university.

JD: Regardless of what we say
about the military,you know good
and well that this university has
decided to make a contribution
to the public domain by forming
these programs. There would be
major issues to consider in
Harrisburg with funding, etc.
There are a lot of concerns, there
are a lot of people if someone
were to move to say, ‘let's get rid
of ROTC.’ I don't think that's a
viable thing at this university at
this time.

can and that no member of this
university violates our policy.
What else is there for us to do?
TPN: But aren't Captain Horoho
and Captain Geoghagan members
of the university. They're in the
Faculty—Staff Directory.

JD: Yes they are. They have
adjunct faculty status. They are
professors of military science. But
they're not tenured staff
professors.

TPN: Why isn't kicking ROTC
off campus a viable solution, in

the sense that that's the only way
across the country in the United
States of America that it's being
solved? The military is not
compromising.

JD: Let's say it's viable. Let's say
you want to discuss that. How
would we as a university do that?
This would begin with a debate
of the faculty and the facutly
would take the issue and the
faculty would vote, and their vote
would be delivered right up the
line and eventually to the Board
of Trustees.

“Anything is everything to a
[handicapped child]. However, I
feel the Pitt volunteer gets more
out of the festival. Being a
volunteer you learn a lot,” Gatto
added.

Volunteering is one part of the
festival, and participating is
another. Participants will enjoy a
day full of activities and
entertainment. Activities include
several game booths such as the
ball toss, duck pond and match
the fruit. Various art booths such
as finger and sponge painting
and wheelchair decorating will
be present as well.

Group entertainment begins at
half-hour intervals all day,

according to Turner. The first
performance will be the Pitt
cheerleaders and the Pitt Panther.
Other entertainment includes 22
Pioneer Clowns, the Pitt Dance

Ensemble, Beautiful Hands, the
winners of this year’s Greek Week
Sing (Chi Omega and Sigma Chi)
and several Pitt football and
basketball players.

A puppet show will also be
performed by the puppet troupe
known as Kids on the Block. The
show will relate to handicapped
children because the puppets are
in wheelchairs or have braces on
their legs, said Turner.

Not only will entertainment be
a part of the festival, but local
celebrities will be there, too. They
include Pittsburgh Steeler John
Jackson, the Pirate Parrot, the B-
94 Bee and the KDKA Bear.

The Hand—in-Hand festival is

' sponsored by Pittsburgh National

Somethmg speczal m the out

After months of sitting in the Senate, President Bush’s
Clean Air bill has finally been passed.

The bill met heavy opposition from West Virginia
Senator Robert Byrd who feared that passing the bill
would result in the loss of thousands of coal mining jobs
in his home state. The legislation establishes the first
attempt at controlling air pollution since 1977, when the
1970 Clean Air Act was amended.

The bill will require auto makers,chemical manufactur-
ers and coal-fired plants to make large cash investments
in equipment and manufacturing processes to decrease
pollution.

_ Among the president's proposals that have been passed

_.._ by the Senate are: industrial plants will be required to
-rinstallgrthev best available technology to - contain 191

hazardous chemicals that are linked to cancer,» nervous-
orders and birth defects; a mandatory 10-million-ton
reduction in sulfur dioxide emissions by the year 1999 to
control acid rain; and all automobile tailpipe emissions of
nitrogen oxides and hydrocarbons must be reduced by 60
percent and 22 percent respectively, and will effect 40
percent of automobiles sold in 1993 and 100 percent of
those sold in 1995, in order to control urban smog.
However, there are repercussions to the bill, it will
likely add over $20 billion annually to the estimated $33
billion that companies must currently pay to meet current
pollution laws. But that is the price you must pay for clean
air, as was affirmed by the 89 senators that voted for the
bill. , ‘

Support for the bill not only signals that the country is
starting to concern itself with the environment, but that
perhaps a bipartisan consensus has been established
between Democrats and Republicans on the environ-
ment. New political policies on important domestic issues
such as the economy, poverty, and homelessness have
met congressional stagnation due to the fact that the two
parties can never reach a coherent agreement on the
exact policy approach that should be implemented to
solve such problems. But the fact that a Democratically-
controlled Senate could overwhelmingly support a Re-
publican administration on this issue may prove that
idiotic and petty politics will not stand in the way of a
clean environment, or at least clean air.

The bill still must face the House of Representatives, but
will likely pass.

You can contribute to
campus wisdom.

Extra year of college is worth it

I’m glad you pointed out in
your editorialof March 28 (“The
Five To Six Year Itch”) that the
majority of American college
students do not graduate within
the “normal? four-year span al-
lotted to such education.

I’ve often advised undergradu-
ates that quality is better than
quantity. That is, it is better to do
well in one’s classes than to get
through in four years. Unfortu-
nately, there seems to be two big
factors wbrking?‘ against this ap-
proach: '

One) l...l Pitt, like virtually all

colleges, operates on the policy’
of 15 credit hours -being the

expected “normal” load of
courses. But this policy stacks the

odds against a student doing well.

Only the exceptional student can
do equally well in all classes

when [he or she] is required to
take ﬁve of them each semester.

Inevitably, at colleges like Pitt,

many students also work to help
support themselves. This, too,

decreases the amount of time a

student devotes to school work.

The end result is that a student

usually concentrates on doing

well in two or three courses while
letting the other courses slide.

Two) Students themselves seem
to be resistant to the idea of
slowing down as a conscious
choice. Since the university re-
gards a 12-hour course load per
semester as still being full—time,
I’ve often suggested a deliberate
strategy of limiting one’s self to
four courses per semester, which
would still graduate a student
after five years.

Students have understandable
objections to deliberately adopt-
ing thisvstrategy. Often they tell
me they are tired of being “poor”
and want to get out into the job
market. Additionally, this ap-
proach would add another year
of student debt to those borrow-
ing to go to college, something
few like to contemplate. Thus,
many take 18+ hours per semes-
ter.

. While this is reasonable, it
presumes there are a lot of
wonderful jobs out there just

waiting for anyone with a [bache-
lor’s degree] to come along and
snap them up. Unfortunately, the
job market is a lot tighter than
most students seem to realize,
and a B.A. is just the basic union
card, not a guarantee of any job.

Letters

Much better to slow down and
do better, thus, increasing one’s
job prospects at least a little.

By loading up on courses —
taking 18+ hours per semester,
for instance —- students not only
do poorly overall, but they tend
to burn out fast. They often end
up taking a semester or a year off
to recuperate. The end result is a
feast or famine approach to
schooling -4 the hurry to gradu-
ate actually contributes to just the
opposite.

When heroes were heroes?

Having just read Paul Kengor’s
editorial regarding Born on the
Fourth of july, I just had to write
to ask: what “good old days of
movies like Sergeant York and
The Longest Day’ ??? You mean
sanitized Hollywood melodramas
with nice black and white (usu-
ally white) heroes, with Uncle
Sam as the perennial good guy;
movies where people are shot
(usually once), don’t bleed and
[die] quickly without a touch of
what some folks refer to as “gore”;
where U.S. good Guys always
win; and where you never, ever
saw innocent people, like villag-
ers and such, get raped, robbed
and/or butchered by accident or
on purpose, like in real life?
First off, I am not a rabid, anti-
American commie, etc., etc. But
you seem to think of the good ol’
U.S. of A. as the selﬂess big-
buddy pro-democracy good dude

C“... the U.S. coming to the aid of
an ally  which had been in-
vaded by Communist subver-
sives,” you said). Never mind, of
course, that the government of
South Vietnam was a corrupt
dictatorship, or that the United
States has supported, and still
does, dictatorships all over the
world, nations which use torture
to stiﬂe political dissent (talk to
the Amnesty International folks
next time they set up, dude, and
see "what countries have been
cited for torture; not all of them
are comrnies, y’ know).

OK, if you don’t like and/or
disagree with Hollvrock, propa-
ganda, fine; you brought up some
telling points. But please, don’t
jam fantasy-land American pie
down our throats, ‘cause [you'd
be] doing what you accuse O.
Stone of, [but] from a different
standpoint.

Forming my own groups

I am glad to see StAR (Students
Against Racism) join in the fight
against graffiti with the SIAG
organization (Students Against
Graffiti). I applaud their efforts in
cleaning up the racial graffiti, but
why stop there? If they are willing
to clean up the racial stuff, then
why don’t they clean up the non-

_racial graffiti as well? Are they

prejudiced against love graffiti or
team-spirit graffiti? This proposes
another question: Is StAR against
all prejudices or just black ra-
cism?

Hopefully, StAR will join other
organizations, such as StAB
(Students Against Barbiturates)
or StAC (Students Against Clut-
ter) or my favorite, SIAL (Stu-
dents Against Liberals)... I have a
suggestion for StAR and these
other groups: form a coalition
called StAT (Students Against
Things).

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Thursday, April 5, 1990

Striving for a kinder, A gentler police department...

Instead of employing the tradi-
tional police motto “To serve and
protect," the Pittsburgh Police
Department uses the expression
“At your service.” This choice of
words is pretty ironic in light of
how the local police treat the
citizens of this city.

For some reason, the Pittsburgh
police have a habit of and thus a
reputation for being anything but
cooperative or helpful when inter-
acting with the people of this
city. It is no secret that the police
are known for verbally and physi-
cally abusing people, whether
they are common criminals or
average citizens. This, of course,
does not apply to every member
of the police force, but it does
apply to many of them.

On Wednesday, March 14,
1990, at 2:30 a.m., my car stalled
out on me in East Liberty. The
alternator was dying. So I put on
my hazard lights and left my car
in the street where it was not
obstructing the vigorous trafﬁc
flow that is common during the
early hours of the morning. I
walked to a nearby telephone
and called a friend to explain my
dilemma. A police car soon came
by, and the officer told me to
move my car. I said I would as
soon as I could. The officer drove
two blocks down the street and
then turned around and came
back. He then told me that if I did
not move my car immediately,
he would give me a ticket and
have my car towed. I went to the

car, and it started, so I took off
hoping to get home before it

stalled again.
But sure enough, the officer

pulled me over as soon as I
started driving. He said that he
had thought that my car was
stalled. I told him that it had
been, and it surely would be
again very soon, and right after I
said that, the -car died again. He
asked for my license and regis-
tration. He soon returned and
said that the next time a police
officer tells me to do something,
do it. He then drove away, leav-
ing me stranded in East Liberty. I
did not get the car started again.
I was not too excited to be stuck
and alone in East Liberty at 2:30
a.m., but the “assistance” that I
received from the police officer
really thrilled me.

Mayor Sophie Masloff, the

members of Pittsburgh City
Council and the citizens of this
city know that the police are not
particularly helpful. Something
should really be done to change
this problem unless we want to
have the rudest police force in
America.

I prefer that a police depart-
ment “serve and protect," al-
though “At your service” is all
right. However, this phrase is
meaningless and unfounded.
Perhaps the police should con-
sider a more realistic motto like
“We are the police” or “We are
here to protect, but not nicely.”

David W. Malta is a columnist
for The Pitt News.

What a Pitt graduate student saw at the revolution

Students have played a major
role in generating the political
pressure which has resulted in
the revolutionary changes in
Eastern Europe. Events that oc-
curred on the evening of Jan. 27
in Warsaw, Poland illustrated how
such pressure is generated by
actions. The Polish Communist
Party had its congress that week-
end. At this congress, the party
was officially dissolved, and two
new “left-of-center” parties were
declared to exist.

The independent Student Un-
ion and other organizations called
for a demonstration at the con-
gress site in order to make known

..tlIt@.ir:sii.s.tas.t,e..f9r the _.<;9.ntinuing

presence of “Communists” in
Poland's official political life. In
accordance with the “round—table
accords” initiated in the fall ‘of
1988, officials who occupied high
positions in the old Communist
Party hierarchy still occupy the
post of president and have the
portfolios of the Mininstries of
Interior and Defense.

Security forces under the con-
trol of the Ministry of Interior
were at the congress site en masse
in expectation of the demonstra-
tion. These were made up pri-
marily of the OPMO, the succes-
sor to the hated ZOMO, which

played such an important role in
implementing the martial- law
crackdown in 1981-82. With the
emergence of the OPMO in force,
the demonstrators began throw-
ingstones, bottles and smoke
devices. The OPMO responded
with baton charges against the
fleeing demonstrators, as well as
charging any subsequent gather-
ing of people, bystanders or
otherwise, in the vicinity. At times,
they beat their shields with their
truncheons, evidently in order to
inspire fear in the groups of
people whom they were ap-
proaching in order to make the
job of dispersal easier.

The fighting occurred well
away from the building where
the congress itself was being
held. The students concentrated
their attention on the OPMO it-
self in the course of running
skirmishes. Whenever the secu-
rity forces caught and beat some-
body in the vicinity of the con-
gress site, camera ﬂashes would
light up the area as photogra-
phers captured the scene on ﬁlm.

Running brawls then spread
throughout the city center. Win-
dows were broken, and cars were
damaged.

The main focus of the demon-
stration, however, shifted to the

nearby train station. Spectators
hostile to the security forces lined
the glass walls of the completely
enclosed station filled the bal-
cony that overlooked the main
hall. The OPMO forces were

, Ben _

hesitant to stay inside the en-
closed structure of the station.
Instead, they would hover out-
side and then charge inside in
order to catch, or at least beat,
those who ~ Agatiiered . to 1 throw
stones at them when they with-
drew. The crowd of spectators
cheered the demonstrators.

The confrontation appeared at
times to be a type of theater. The
demonstrators and the OPMO
forces seemed to act according to
loose but well—rehearsed roles
thatstipulatedsome self-imposed
limitations on their respective
behavior: nobody made a seri-
ous effort to escalate the conflict
beyond stone and bottle throw-
ing and non—lethal beating with
truncheons. Also, some mem-
bers of the security forces, along
with some of those battling them,

were visibly experiencing an
adrenaline high during the con-
flict. In the station, the students
were joined by a number of young
boys and some whom would be
classified as “socially deviant.”
The spectators occupied an
important part in the drama, and
they certainly enjoyed them-
selves.

The seriousness of this “thea-
ter," however, was evident in the
blood on the floor of the train
station. Also, one very young
OPMO man who approached me
was obviously very tense, nerv-
ous and somewhat afraid. If‘ out
of fear and tension someone had
done‘ something beyond the
bounds of the generally accepted;
then group self-restraints on
behavior could well have been
removed. Such lapses have a

significant probability of result-
ing in tragic incidents, such as the
shootings at Kent State.

The total number of civilians
wounded during the course of
the evening is still unknown,
although at least a few were
carried out of the station in the
course of the brawl. Thirty
members of the security forces
were wounded, with five taken
away by ambulance.

The violent confrontation at

the train station lasted for a few
hours. It ended very quickly with
the sudden disappearance of the
most active demonstrators. I
noticed that the substantial group
of photographers had also disap-
peared. I later read in a small
article on the second page of
Gazeta Wyborcza that some
photographers had also been
attacked by the OPMO and some
photographic equipment had
been destroyed.

These events are being used to
increase the political pressure
upon the -Polish authorities to
change the “round-table accords"
and remove someof the former
Communists from the remaining
high’ positions in the Poli‘slLgov-
emment. In response to protests

raised over the activities of the _

internal—security forces during a

series of protests that have oc— ’

curred in a number of cities,
Premier Mazowiechki has made
changes in the top leadership of
the Interior Ministry. No public
indication exists, however, that
the removal of the interior minis-
ter himself has become an immi-
nent possibility.

Notorious ‘Oa/elana’ Five’ are getting canned by tbe police

The sisters of Delta Delta Delta
probably never figured that they
had five hardened criminals in
their midst.

Indeed, Al Capone has nothing
on these guys, that is, if you
speak to the Upper St. Clair Po-
lice.

On the afternoon of Thursday,
March 29, 1990, five Tri-Delts set
off on a devious mission to topple
mankind. The repercussions of
what these young ladies could
have done without the sudden
intervention of a USC officer are
indeed frightening.

For on that day, the long arm of
the law saved the entire USC
community. The officer single-
handedly stopped the evil five
from the ultimate offense, that
unspeakable act of crime: raising
money for a local hospital.

That's right —- Kristy Quarzo,
Alicia Maloney, Beth Wettereau,
Julie Black and Bethany Blake
had the gall to ask people for

charitable Contributions for St.
Francis Medical Center.

Incidentally, only integral Pitt
News sources gave us the identity
of the quintet. When Upper St.
Clair police officer Burkhardt was
questioned, he responded with a
terse, “We don’t feel it is neces-
sary to divulge those names.”

Perfectly understandable. I'm
sure John Wilkes Booth’s name
was withheld from the press for a
short time, also.

Anyway, this officer luckily
arrived on the scene to put an
end to this treacherous act. With
pen and pad in hand, he ren-

dered justice. He immediately " "

fined the girls $52.50 each and

told them to get out of town and‘

never come back.

Rumors are that the FBI has
been contacted and plans to
implement a special-task force to
forever abolish this hideous crime
known as “canning.” It’s not yet
known whether Gov. Robert

Casey has declared a state of
emergency in the Pittsburgh area
because there are supposedly
hundreds of young people in the

 

Ed
Kuznik

area who have been trying to
undermine human morality by
canning during the past month.
There may be a little bit of
exaggeration about the situation
in the past few paragraphs you
just read, but there is no getting

around the fact that what hap-
pened last Thursday was among
the most ridiculous and closed-
minded examples of law enforce-
ment that one will ever witness.
It’s common knowledge that
every year around the end of
March the entire Pitt Greek sys-
tem gets together to raise money
for a local charity. Last year, over
$88,000 was garnered. Obviously,
the only way that a college stu-
dent could get this money would
be to solicit on the streets of the
Pittsburgh area.
Technically, it's against the law
to solicit in this manner because
these people do not have the
type of solicitation license needed
to do so. Then again, I don't
think that when this law was im-
plemented that it was meant to
curtail 19-year-old college stu-

Burkhardt roared when asked

why the girls had been fined.
So is jaywalking, but how often
is it enforced?

whole that you get a warning

Every once in a while, people
have to make personal decisions
— decisions that would be for
the betterment of all. A police

not allow the law to be broken,

that it is logically enforced.

Steelers in dire need of pass rush — look to linebackers

The Pittsburgh Steelers’ loss to the Denver Broncos in the 1989
playoffs revealed two outstanding aspects of the team:

The first was heart and guts, which Chuck Noll’s team was
surprisingly found to have plenty of, especially when considering the
basically pathetic way it started off the season.

Except, heart is only a crucial thing when you’re a cardiologist
looking for business. In football terms, it’s often the equivalent of
“Nice try, fellas.”

The second was lineup holes, which could easily be interpreted as
craters for a team running on all four cylinders, playing at its best,
which Pittsburgh was heading 4
into the playoffs and through the
wild—card game against Houston.

The Steelers played awfully well
against Denver but still lost 24-23
to a team that went on to lose 55-
'10 in the Super Bowl.

Which means’ one thing:
Pittsburgh could use quite a few
more cylinders‘.

Pittsburgh has the 17th selection
in the first round of this year’s
NFL draft and two of the first 55
picks, and, to put it mildly, they
are crucial to this team’s future.

What makes these picks even
more precious is because of the
oddity of this draft -7- the first in
NFL history to uninhibitedly permit all college juniors (who filled out
the simple application) to be eligible.

In short, as one football analyst put it, it’s the richest ever in terms
of free-ﬂowing talent. And by drafting reasonably well, Pittsburgh
could leap to the top of its division.

By drafting excellently, the Steelers could add to the foundation
that could take them to the top of the league. ,

What Denver used to kill Pittsburgh in the playoffs was, without
question, the long ball. The Steelers’ pass rush simply was unable to
put enough containing pressure on John Elway, let alone sack the
Bronco quarterback, and, hey, let alone do those things to any other
guy who played the position against Pittsburgh last season. Or

throughout the decade.

Obviously, Keith Gary, Darryl Sims and Aaron Jones at defensive

end weren’t the answer.

And this not being a particularly strong draft for pure pass-rushing '
‘ defensive ends, it’s not the right avenue to take, at least not with the

Sub-par pressure from Aaron Jones and the defensive line will force the Steelers to look at their
linebackers as potential pass-rush prospects.

Senior Christy looking to excel after knee injury

By Scott Campbell
Staff Writer

Two years ago, sophomore Jeff Christy
expected big things from himself at the

‘Panthers’ spring—football practice. And

why not? As a freshman the year before,
Christy registered 35 tackles and started
four games, ﬁlling in at linebacker for the
8-4 Panthers, while starter Jerry Olsavsky
was injured.

Pitt Coach Mike Gottfried experimented
with him at fullback that spring and with
good reason. Christy had over 2,800 yards
rushing at Free port High School and made
all the Top—100 high—school player lists:
Bally’s, Emfinger’s, Street 6} Smith 3,
Athlon’s  He was handed the title “blue
chipper” before he even donned Pitt’s
blue and gold, No_. 44 jersey.

That spring, however, Christy injured
his knee while participating in Oklahoma
drills. At first he thought it was nothing,
and the knee wasn’t bothering him, so he
rested it over the summer and came to fall
camp ready to battle Dan Crossman for
the starting fullback position. But the
knee,’ neglected all summer, exploded on
the first day of contact drills.

“The first three days, we wore shorts,
and it was ﬁne," said Christy. “But then we

‘ started hitting. I was carrying the ball; I got

' .2e.v.mv.-awmvu arm.» n r IlJ‘J‘ us» in

V11-‘nits or V .. 5.: .1» t:‘a»'«4' ml‘ aw .2

hit and landed on my knee, and that was
it. As soon as it happened, I knew that it
was bad.”

Reluctant to give up the season just yet,
Christy managed to play against Ohio
State in Pitt’s second game. He carried the
ball once for 11 yards and even punted

him to play. Pitt’s sports—information
department didn’t even include him in the
1989 Media Guide, and he was forced to
sit out that season, losing a year of
eligibility in the process.

Christy is back for one more shot this
spring and with a new position to boot.

 

three times fora 27.3 average when the
Panthers were scramblingto find a starting
punter. I

“When I tried to punt, my knee really
started bothering me," Christy said.

The Panthers waited a week and then
decided to redshirt him for the rest of the
season after discovering that ligaments
had been severely torn. -

The next spring, Christy’s knee still
wasn’t healed properly enough to allow

He’s given up his No. 44 for a No. 62
jersey, that of an offensive guard, and he
has packed 35 pounds on his 6—foot-2-
inch frame since last September, raising
his weight to 265. ’

“I could always gain weight pretty easily,”
Christy said. “I like to eat a lot.”

But why an offensive guard, a position
that Christy hadn't played since the seventh
grade?

“They were pretty much set at linebacker

..‘..,~. ....,)s__/ ‘~_,..;,«_,.~_.., r_~,.. M1*‘,ﬁ'4t.“lt;n-

[and fullback], and I’d rather play at a
position where they need help than not
play at a position that’s already filled,”
Christy said.

Pitt has only two returning starters from
last year’s offensive line: sophomores Mike
LiVorio and Chris Sestilli.

“He’s a good athlete. He’s got a lot to
learn, but he's handling it pretty well,” said
Pitt’s offensive coordinator Bill Meyers.
“He’s working hard to grasp the nuances
of the position.” _

“I’d like to play a lot this year," Christy
said, “and maybe even start at some point.”

Christy is listed as a redshirt senior in
Pitt’s spring guide and fourth among
returning lettermen guards, behind Dave
Dixon, Tony Delazio and Gary Gorajewski.

Christy said he plans to go full speed on
the injured knee this spring.

“It’s fine now, and the strength coach
said it’s as strong as ,anybody’s on the
team,” Christy said. “I’ve spent a long time
rehabilitating it and workin g with weights.
I think I'm ready.”

He might never achieve the success that
he had in high school, but neither he nor
Meyers feels that his career is over yet.

“We don’t know what his role is going
to be yet,” said Meyers, “but he’s got good
football sense, and he’s working hard to

-be a major contributor to this. team.”

The National League East is up
for grabs. The New York Mets are
the front—runners. The Chicago
Cubs and the St. Louis Cardinals
could win it if everything works
out. The Pittsburgh Pirates really
don’t fit in any particular place.
The Philadelphia Phillies
represent the youth. The Montreal
Expos represent a troubled
franchise that must nowwait to
cash in all the draft choices it
received from the losses due to
free-agency.

The New York Mets were
supposed to be doing what the
Oakland Athletics have done over
the past few years —— dominate
baseball. The team chemistry has
been bad on this ball club since
the 1986 championship. Ittook
strides to change that by acquiring
the NL’s best closer, John Franco.
He adds to a very good, if not
great, pitching staff. The Doctor,
Dwight Gooden, says he has
recovered from his shoulder

' problems and should be back to

being the best NL pitcher, Doc is
followed in the rotation by David
Cone, Sid Fernandez, Frank Viola,
Ron Darling and Bob Ojeda.
General manager Frank Cashen
will probably trade one of the
starters to sure up the top of the
lineup. As of now, look for Keith
Miller to lead off and play center.
They have a problem at first base
because both Mike Marshall and
Dave Magadan want to play every
day. Marshall might move to left,

and then Kevin McReynolds will i

play center. If that happens, Gregg
Jeffries will lead off ' and play

second. Faces to watch will be '

Viola (Can he dominate the NL
like he did the AL?), Julio Machado
(How many batters will charge
the mound?) and jeffries (Will
everyone realize he did have a
great year for a rookie last year?).

The Chicago Cubs won the
NL,.East last year. How did they
do it? They worked as a team.
There are really no superstars on
this team. Ryne Sandberg will
eventually make the Hall of Fame
if he stays healthy, but he goes
about his work quietly. Andre
Dawson is past his prime and
may have to go on the disabled
list to start the season. Rick
Sutcliffe is 33 years old and still

pitching well. The power in this

organization comes with its youth.
Jerome Walton, the center fielder,
won the NL Rookie of the Year,
while his teammate left—f1e1der
Dwight Smith finished a close
second. Twenty—three—year—old
Greg Maddux is the ace of the
staff. Last year, he won 19 games
with an earned—run average of
2.95. The rest of the staff will be
composed of Mike Bielecki, Mike
Harkey and either Steve Wilson
or Kevin Blankenship. Third base
is the only real question on this
team besides having the
youngsters handling the heights
of the NL East penthouse. Faces
to watch will be Harkey, Luis
Salazar, with his ability to be an
everyday third baseman, and
Mitch Williams in his second tour
of an NL schedule.

The Pittsburgh Pirates
epitomize a team that is hard to
figure out. Are they as good as
1988 or as bad as 1989? They are

probably somewhere "in between.
They tried to help the starting
rotation with the addition of Walt
Terrell. He has averaged 200
innings pitched each year over
the last six. That was the main
reason for his acquisition ——
quality pitching. This will help
the middle relief of the Pirates
since they really don’t have any
withlthe loss of Bob Kipper for
the beginning part of the season.
The starting rotation will be Doug
Drabek, John Smiley, Neal
Heaton, Bob Walk and Terrell.
The big change will be in the
field with Bobby Bonilla moving
to right field and Jeff King being
added at third and in the everyday
lineup. If King falls through at
third, look for Wally Backman,
signed as a free agent, to play
third and lead off. That would
makeBarry Bonds a very happy
fifth hitter. Faces to watch will be
Andy Van Slyke (Will his hitting
ever get back to matching his
fielding expertise’), Don Slaught
(Was he worth Jeff Robinson and

9 Willie Smith?) and R.J. Reynolds

(Can manager Jim Leyland find
him at-bats in the crowded
outfield?).

The St. Louis Cardinals can

contend for this division if one
thing happens: their pitching
becomes healthy overnight.
Danny Cox has already been
placed on the 21-day disabled
list, while Todd Worrell has been
placed on the 60-day DL. Worrell
said he would be very happy if
he could be back by the All-Star

Ron
Ledgard

break. Manager Whitey Herzog
has produced miracles with
pitching before, and if he does it
again,_ the Cards won’t finish
fourth. The infield is set along
with the right and center fields.
The question is in left. Is it Vince
Coleman, who would be a .290
hitter if he ever learned to bunt,
or Milt Thompson, the guy who
filled in impressively for Willie
McGee by batting .290 (tied for
10th in the NL)? Faces to watch
will be John Tudor (Will he join
Cox on the DL.’), McGee (Will he
be the center fielder for another
team?) and Scott Terry (Can he

hold the Cards together while
Worrell is in rehab?).
The Philadelphia Phillies are
a very young and hungry team.
The additions of Len Dykstra and
John Kruk gave this team a big lift
by providing the attitude it takes
to become a winner. The
additions of Terry Mulholland,
Dennis Cook and Charlie Hayes
for Steve Bedrosian was a brilliant
move by GM Lee Thomas. He
also found his closer, Roger
McDowell, in the Dykstra trade.
This team is finally on its way
‘back to the top. One thing to
keep in mind: The Pirates were
also on their way back to the top.
Last year, they took a detour (5th
place). Catcher is questionable,
as is third. They will continue to
go with Steve Lake" and Darren
Daulton behind the plate. At third
is Hayes. He hit .257 with eight
homers in 79 games, but don’t
forget the 22 errors. Faces to
watch will be Ricky Jordan (Can
he continue to rise as a star first
baseman?), Dickie Thon (Was
last year a fluke for the shortstop?)
and Pat Combs (Will he join Pirate
John Smiley and Brave Tom
Glavine in the top young lefties
in the NL?). ’

‘Anybodyts ball game (except Mtland Pbiloz.) in N1; East

The Montreal Expos have
fallen apart at the seams. They
lost Hubie Brooks, Mark Langston,
Bryn Smith and Pascuel Perez to
free-agency. They also lost six
great pitching prospects in the
deals to obtain Langston and Zane
Smith last year. That is a total of
nine pitchers and your everyday
right ﬁelder in less than a year.
No organization, not even the
Mets, could withstand those types
of losses without any gains. They
did add Oil ‘Can Boyd to the
rotation, but he is known for arm
problems. The ‘rotation is Boyd,
Kevin Gross, Mark Gardner, Smith
and the ace Denny Martinez. Tim
Burke is a capable stopper, but
this team is going to be behind in
a lot of games. Its biggest plus
will come in the way of
compensation by draft choices
for all the players lost to free-
agency. Faces to watch will be
Delino Deshields (Can he fulfill

all of his promises at shortstop?), '

Junior Noboa, (Can the second
baseman hit like he did last year
in Triple A ball?) and GM Dave
Dombrowski (Can he keep his
job long enough to see all the
draft choices make it tothe big

' leagues?).

first selection.

The suggestion here is that the
Steelers do what has improved
the pass rushes of the Buffalo
Bills, New York Giants and New
England Patriots and snag that
powerful speed—rushing outside
linebacker.

Now, it’s safe to say that there
will be no real Cornelius Bennetts,
Lawrence Taylors or Andre
T ippetts available come the 17th
pick, but there will be some
awfully good guys who will do
just fine.

Some of these players could
conceivably be available when
Pittsburgh makes its selection:
James Francis (Baylor), Aaron
Wallace (Texas A&M), Chris

‘Singleton (Arizona), [Renaldo
Tumbull (West Virginia), Ron Cox
(Fresno State) and Huey
Richardson (Florida).

Keith McCants of Alabama and
Junior Seau of USC will be long
gone by then, so we'll leave them
out totally of the realistic picture.

The teams drafting before the
Steelers that desperately need
first— round quality linebacking
as a top priority are New England,
San Diego, Detroit, Miami, Los
Angeles, Houston and Cincinnati.

But these teams, especially the
Raiders, may be looking to fill the
inside positions, where Percy
Snow (Michigan State) and Lamar
Lathon (Houston) are two of the
top prospects.

Now, another obvious strength
of this 1990 draft is the wealth of
talent at the running back position.
Darrell Thompson (Minnesota),
Anthony Thompson (Indiana),
Harold Green (South Carolina)
and Emmitt Smith (Florida) will
likely ﬁll space, as the Patriots,
Chargers and Raiders —- yes, the
Raiders; Marcus Allen (293 yards

in 1989) is aging, and B0 is

season at max —— could look right ‘

Thus, the quality of running

But what also sets up the
Steelers is the fact that Seattle, a
team that is solid with young
linebacking talent, has two
selections in the first 10 picks, a
and the Seahawks are almost
certain to look for help in other
areas, like running back and
defensive end. Especially running
back.

So the combination of a deep
ﬁrst—round due to the junior-senior
draft, the amount of strong
running back prospects, and the
wealth of quality linebackers in
general should ensure Pittsburgh
of success in awakening a pass
rush that slept soundly through
the 19803.

Might even ensure another
playoff shot at those Broncos,
too.

Shortly after this 90-minute
karate-fest had ended and all the
kiddies were anxiously lined up
for T-shirts outside the theater,
my friend turhed to me and said,
“One of the reasons I won’t have
kids is so I don’t have to bring
them to movies like this.”

Sure, Teenage Mutant Ninja
Turtles is violent, uninspired,
conventional garbage that
replaces characters with
caricatures and dialogue with
“dudes.”

. Yes, it’s an opportunistic, low-
budget exploitation of the popular
comic book and cartoon stars
that screams “SEQUEL. ” And yes,
the acting is atrocious, and the
repetitious script is hopelessly
unoriginal and predictable.

But, this little $12—million film
from Electric Dreams director
Steven Barron oozes a modest,
quirky charm that embarrasses
the expensive blockbusters and
features five amazingly expressive
creatures designed by master
puppeteerjim Henson C T beDark

teens who talk like somewhat
dated versions of Jeff Spicolli in
Fast Times at Ridgemont High.

Together they meet up with
self—styled street vigilante Casey
Jones, played with zest by
newcomer and future star Elias
Koteas, who battles crime with
sporting goods and helps the
turtles rescue their mutant rat
mentor, Splinter, from the clutches
of the evil clan.

According to many of the turtles’
5-year-old followers I talked to at
the theater, this treatment remains
fairly faithful to the original comic
book by the turtles’ creators Kevin
Eastman and Peter Laird.

And according to another
faithful fan of the comic book,
the violence in the film is toned
down from bloodthirsty stabbings
to campy karate sequences that
serve as beautiful parodies of
Bruce lee ﬂicks and the “Batman”
television series.

The mundane script is saved
from being completely forgettable
by refreshing moments geared
more towards its teen and parent
viewers. Surely, dialogue like
Splinter’s “Let us all meditate
tonight’s events” and April’s
command to “Shut up and kiss
me” wasn’t written to be taken
too seriously.

The film often tries to restrain
itself from allowing too much,
self-mockery but shines most
when it really lets loose with its
satirical theme. There is a 20-
minute fight scene and a training
montage that are both especially
funny.

The changing faces of Eide’s records and comics

By Jennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer

What started out 18 years ago
as a small comic—book store in
Etna has now grown into one of
Pittsburgh’s largest sources for
used records, alternative music,
videos and of course, comics.

Greg Eide, owner of Eide’s
Comics and Records, said he
opened the first store because of
his love for collecting comic
books.

“It was tiny, probably about
the size of two or three
bathrooms,” he said. “I was just
young and stupid.”

Eide put himself through
Duquesne University with the
profits from the comic store and
then moved Eide’s to Federal
Street on the North Side. This was
just the first of three moves that
Eide’s has made since it opened.
During the 10 years that Eide’s
spent on Federal Street, he picked
up a record business to add to the

comics.

“A good friend of mine at the
time wanted to sell used records
in my store, so I let him. When he
left, I took [the record sales] over,”
he said.

Eide added new records to the
business and said that his North
Side store was one of the first
outlets for progressive music in
Pittsburgh. Eide’s branched out
into two stores while at its third
home in the North Hills Village
Shopping Center. The second
store is now located in Squirrel
Hill. T -
About five years ago, Eide’s
moved downtown to 940 Penn
Ave., where it stayed until last
month. Eide said a new landlord
was the reason for his last move
to 1111 Penn Ave.

“The building got sold, and the
new landlord didn’t think that
having kids [wearing] mohawks
walking into the building [to come
to Eide’s] Vvould be good for the
upscale business offices . he

He’s a delinquent.

wanted to have,” Eide said.

Eide said his clientele is now
made up of a wide variety of
people, all with a dedication to
music.

“The kind of people who come
to Eide’s know what is happening
before it happens. They don’t
shop at places like Record Mart,
and they wouldn’t think twice
about spending $100 in a week
on music,” he said. \

Music now makes up the bulk
of Eide’s business, with the lower
level of the store featuring comics
and the upstairs ﬁlled with music.
Eide said his business is about
evenly split between albums and
compact discs.

“The chain stores have almost
totally abandoned vinyl, and I’m
fighting an uphill battle because
the companies just don’t make a
lot of the stuff on vinyl any
more,” he said.

Eide said that there is another
big difference between his store
and the chain stores: prices.

“While the chain stores usually

sell things at list price, or even

above that, most of my stuff is at
least $1 off the list,” he said.

His employees are just like his
family to him, Eide said, adding
that, “most of the time that I’m
awake, I’m at this store.”

Rick Vlaky, who has worked at
Eide’s for more than 11 years,
said that he has seen a lot of
changes since he started there.

“When I first started, our
clientele was about 95 percent
young males because of the
comics. Now, a lot of women
come into the store. We also
have so many more employees,
almost 30 now,” he said.

Eide said that for all the changes,
some things are still. the same.

“There are some things that
just cannot change, like a great
old [Bob] Dylan album. I have
always loved the music, so I love
selling it,” Eide said.

The Pitt News

Generally, when I see a play, I
leave either loving it or grumbling

 ' about it. Either I'm full of praise,

tripping over myself to talk people
into going to see it, or I tell
everyone who asks not to waste
his or her time.

But neither is the case with Pitt
Theatre’s main-stage production
of The Oresteia. Though it
definitely had its moments, it
wasn’t up to par with some of the
main—stage productions of the
past few years.

Its “moments” included a few
great performances and one really
great scene. Unfortunately, it also
included a few jolts into reality -
a few reminders that the actors
on stage were, in fact, only actors.

Among the best choices made
by Director W. Steven Coleman
for this production was his
selection of Patricia Grace Miles
to portray Clytemnestra. Miles is
frightfully castrating as the

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Thursday, April 5, 1990

Pitt's Oresteia not in the classics tradition

vengeful queen, bringing a special
strength and haughtiness to the
role.

Steven J. Anderson is an
impressive Orestes, playing his
grief and turmoil over the murder
of his father with convincing
emotion. He‘comes across with
atypical honesty.

Sara Jane Fleming really
commands respect with her
portrayal of Cassandra. As the
best-of-the—lot beauty of Troy
turned slave girl, she is totally
digniﬁed.

During the trial of Orestes, Anne
Louise Bannon is the perfect
Athena, remaining cool and
poised throughout the
proceedings and giving the
traditionally chilly goddess a sense
of humor.

The Furies virtually attack, the
audience, hanging over the stage
and hissing and scowling at us
like rabid cats. Their bit was
beautifully choreographed and
added significantly to the
production.

    

OOOIIOIOOOOOOOOIOOOOIOOO

 

 

The Furies are particularly
effective during the trial scene (in
Tbe Eumenides, the third play),
preying on the clinging, desperate
Orestes and stating their case
with conviction to rival that in
And justice ForAll.

The trial scene also happens to
be in the best play, with its entire
cast performing very well.

The not-so—good performances
—— the ones that slapped me in
the face with the knowledge that
I was only an audience member
and this was only a play --
included a rather empty reading
by Dereck Walton, who plays
Aegisthus, Clytemnestra’s
conspirator in murder. His
performance lacks a real
characterization.

Another example of this isjane
Gentry’s Electra, who over-en-
UN-ci—a-TED her lines to the
extent that she came across as an
actress (as opposed to the
emotionally wrecked Electra),
trying very hard to be heard at the
back of the theater. As Electra, it
seems that sort of clarity and
composure would be the farthest
things from her mind.

While these sorts of
performances aren’t enough to
ruin the production, they are very
distracting and disappointing.

I've heard some complaints
about the translation (by Tony
Harrison), but it impressed me

Sam Kinison: Leader of the Banned

By Tim Azinger
Showcase Editor

Anyone familiar with Sam
Kinison would expect him to be
loud, obnoxious and crude to the
gills. So I was pleasantly shocked
to speak to a moderately voiced,
calm, intelligent gentleman from

r the mobile phone in his tour bus

somewhere outside Syracuse,
N.Y.

Kinison is currently on tour in
support of his latest album, Leader
oftbe Banned, a combination of
his wired comedic style and his
new—found hobby: wailing
rock’n’roll.

Despite many of the
misconceptions people hold
about Kinison, he is truly

concerned with many of today’s
touchy subjects.

Where do you get a lot of the
ideas for your material from?

Basically, things that make me
laugh. And they can come from
anywhere. What I normally do is
go and hang out at clubs. I’ll
spend six to eight weeks just
going to rock clubs and comedy
clubs on the outskirts of lLos
Angelesl. I don’t go to The
Comedy Store or the Improv or
those places anymore because

too many people there do my
act.

Do you believe you shock so
many people because there is
a very conservative ideology
in the United States today?

I think people perceived me in
the very beginning as a “shock
comic,” but I don’t think that’s
the basis for my comedy. People
that are extremely conservative
probably would be shocked. The
audience I go for is one that is a
little more clever and can
appreciate “statement comedy.”

be a priest at one time?
No, I was a minister; an

* evangelist.

What made you decide to get
out of it?

Well, I got a divorce, and I had
been at it seven years. I felt like
my life had evolved to the point
where I was fed up with it. It’s
like the Peace Corps to- me. I’d
been in it seven years, and I felt
by then that I could leave pretty
honorably, so I did in 1978. And
as you can tell, there’ve been a lot
of changes since then!

Some of your material refers
to homosexuals. Is there a
reason for this?

I made statements on my last
album that some people found
offensive. It’s not a big portion of
my act. It’s obvious that AIDS is
the Current topic, and it’s
something that needs to be
responded to one way or the
other.

I had a lot of protests on my last
tour in certain cities. Basically,
gay groups felt that I was anti—gay
and sexist, that I wasn’t doing my
part and that the jokes were
medically incorrect. I noticed
during [Andrew “Dice” Clay’s] tour

I---STUDENT
GVERNMENT  

Student Government Board V

that none of these things took
place, so I felt pretty much targeted
for harassment.

A lot of gay groups used me as
a way to get attention for
themselves and their local
communities, which is fine, but
they don’t do their homework. If
they did, they’d find out that I’ve
helped raise close to $500,000 in
the last year for people that are at
the forefront of AIDS research.

On this album, Leader of the
Banned, which is my third album,
I put in medically correct
information, and my second
album, Have You Seen Me Lately,
was the first album to carry an
AIDS-information sheet and an
AIDS pamphlet.

There was a lot _of
misinformation that went out in
the Rolling Stone and other
publications on the last tour.
[They] tried to label me like I was
a gay basher and encouraged
violence toward gays. That was
all bullshit. Lies!

What’s your deﬁnition of the
perfect woman?

Um. God, I wouldn’t know!
I’ve been married twice. It’s not
Jessica Hahn. You can rule that
one out.

Local performs in television Version of Equal justice

By Richard Turgeon
Staff Writer

Pitt senior Keith Wilson saw
himself dead on national
television on March 27. He had
auditioned for the part of Stevie
Howard in the new ABC television
series”Equa1Justice” almost a year
ago today.

“Equal Justice” is directed and
executively produced by Thomas
Carter, who gave us early episodes
of NBC’s “Miami Vice” and starred
as Washington on the now-
defunct series “The White
Shadow”.

“Equal Justice” looks at a
network of lawyers in Pittsburgh
and is an engrossing and gritty
cross between “L.A. Law” and

“thirtysomething” It stars Sarah
Jessica Parker, Deborah
Farentino, Joe Morton and
Gregory Malar, and the first
episode of the series premiered
the day after its pilot.

Wilson played a young man
who is caught stealing by four
white policemen who beat him

to death. A good deal of the
pilot’s plot revolves around the
black prosecutor’s fight with
Stevie’s mother to bring the
lawmen to justice.

Although Wilson was seen on
screen only briefly in two scenes
in still pictures, the experience
was his first character role. A
rhetoric and communications
major because “I wanted to have
a degree I could do anything
with,” he landed extra parts in
three other locally shot films,
including the recently wrapped
Jonathan Demme picture Silence
of tbeLambs, by sending his head
shot to an agent located
downtown.

The audition for "Equal
Justice”pitted him against 14 other
local actors. After the number
was narrowed down to three,
Wilson was rewarded with the

role after meeting with the
director, Thomas Carter, and was
sent straight to the wardrobe
department to get fitted for a
costume.

Three days later, on the first
day of shooting, Wilson met his
makeup artist, Carla Palince
(R0boc0p), whose job it was to
accurately make Wilson look like
the beaten victim as described in
the teleplay. On location at the
high school on Fifth Avenue,
work started at 10 a.m. and lasted
until 11 p.m. that night.

Out of5O shots taken, only four
were acceptable. A reshoot was
necessary.

A few days after his first day, he
was called back for second takes
that lasted the entire day again, as
Palince was forced to divide her
time between Wilson and the live
actors on the set.

During the second takes, he
felt more relaxed and got to know
his co-stars better, including the
show’s director, whom Wilson
hopes to work with again
someday.

He described the cast and crew
of “Equal Justice” as being “great
people” and says of Carter, “What

he does, he does very well.”

He plans on attending graduate
school for film production or
acting, and although he eventually
would like to direct and star in his
own films, he realizes that “acting
is a lot harder than just getting a
degree.”

I _ It’s been 10 years since Robert

Plant last sang with Led Zeppelin,
and 10 years ﬁlled with a hit-and-

thing Plant has always had going
for him is that he is, well, Robert
Plant. With his history,
expectations run high on every
release, and fans yearn to hear
Plant and maybe, just maybe, a
snippet bf Zeppelin.

Following on the heels of the
highly successful Now and Zen,
Plant has produced what is
probably his best entire album
since Zeppelin parted ways in
Manic Nirvana. Although he’s
had commercial success with
nearly all of his five solo releases,
it seems that'Plant has ﬁnally

Boyle's guitar is a mainstay rather
than a filler behind Plant’s voice.
He has given up the new-age
music phase that made his Shaken
‘n Stirned a flop in 1985 and
instead just experimented with
the methods used on Now and
Zen—— sampling, overdubs, tight
guitar and the trademark Plant
voice. .

The first single, “Hurting Kind
(I’ve Got My Eyes On You)” is a
fairly good gauge of the entire
work, although it is certainly
geared towards the radio market.
“Tie-Dye On The Highway” lauds

1 1th Hour has been a Pittsburgh
rock staple for over 3 years, but
Shapes and Things to Come is
their ﬁrstful1—length release. Prior
to this LP, 11th Hour released an
EP, “Alder Street.” (The CD version
of Shapes and Things to Come
includes “Alder Street. ”)

Of the 13 tracks on the album,
all but one song are originals.
11th Hotir has taken the Eddie
and the Hotrods tune “Do
Anything You Want to Do” and
made it its own.

Other standouts on the album
include the opening track
“Release You,” with its crescendo
drum-beat introduction, and the
echoing, murky “I'm Coming
Down.”

11th Hour abandons its
standard rocking/pop sound on
the brief, atmospheric “Garden
of Sleep” and shows just how
diversified its sound can be.

Shapes and Things to Come has
a little bit of everything on it. To
simply call it a professional,

accessible, power pop—rock
record would be an
understatement.

and wails on the debut album,
you'll have to settle for an
occasional tempest on her latest.

Her second album is far more
simple vocally and is less urgent
than before. Prince, who has
managed to grace every artist's
album this‘ century (except
perhaps Elvis Presley or the
Doors) has managed to bring his
own narcoleptic lyrics to yet
another European musician with
“Nothing Compares ’2U,” a
droning melody that starts the
album off witha bland.

However, if you can sift through
the sap, there are some songs that
make the album definitely worth
the time and money.

“I am Stretched on Your Grave”
is an unusual lament for a dead
lover that vividly paints the image
of some Shakespearean tragedy.
Written by Phillip A‘ King, the
melody and eerie lyrics are
strongly engaging.

Tonight at Zelda’s
{;'£;«“1‘$i‘£i;§i" 5'9” .""1"1”,§T....

In “Black Boys on Mopeds,”
O’Connor is taking liberty to
deﬂate the mystical image of
England's “Madame George and

‘Roses”. She compares Margaret

Thatcher’s actions concerning a
young black man being clubbed
to death by English police to the
slaughter of students in Beijing
this past summer. It is a strong
political statement without being
hokey in its lyrics or sound.

But perhaps the song that is
most musically and emotionally
powerful the a cappella title
track “I do not want what I
haven't got.":No instruments, no
other artist, no ﬂuff, no Prince-
ish lyrics — this is the stuff that
makes O’Connor outshine
hyped-u p gleam music from MTV
(Murky Television). It’s her
ethereal contribution that pulls
this album together.

spots, nearly choked the people
directly in front of the stage.
(They were hacking and trying to
wave it away with their programs.)

Costume design (by Lorraine
Venberg) was exceptional and
ranged from the classic Greek
toga for Athena to the bizarre
masks and tattered robes worn

by the Furies and the chorus.

All things considered, the good
outweighs the bad in Pitt's
production of The Oresteia. The
production offers enough talent
and great performances to
recommend itself in spite of a
few flaws.
