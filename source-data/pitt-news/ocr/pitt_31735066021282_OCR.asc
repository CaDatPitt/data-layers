Hoping to “cut the bu-
reaucracy, or at least lessen
it,” Allocations Committee
Chairman Gil Borok has
submitted a plan to admini-
stration officials to improve
the allocations process, in-
cluding guidelines to use
the money in the reserve
fund.

Borok said that he
doesn’t know how much
money is in the reserve fund,
but said he has heard esti-
mates as high as $42,000.
He added that he knows
that there have been no

Assistant News Editor

Dr. Clifton R. Wharton,
Jr. congratulated graduat-
ing Pitt students at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh’s 167th
Commencement Convoca-
tion, but warned them that
only education would solve

the problems of an aging‘

society.
“The disproportionate

. number of baby-boomers

in the general population
seems to suggest that as
they go, so will go the
country. From a society of
youth, we. are abruptly and
rather surprisingly being
transformed into an aging
society,” said Wharton, the
chairman and chief execu-
tive of the Teachers Insur-
ance and Annuity Associa-
tion of America and the

S” Perspective,   if

Fund.

“With rising numbers of
elderly retiring and fewer
children left to replace them,
who will carry, much less
repay, this burden of debt?”
Wharton asked the gradu-
ates. .

Wharton said that by the
year 2030, when all of the
baby-boomers will have
reached age 65, the number
of senior citizens in the
United States will have in-
creased from 28. 5 million in
1985 to over 64 million.

, This increase of elderly
citizens will have a dra-
matic effect on the labor
pool, according to Whar-
ton. He estimated that by
2030 there will only be three
people working for every
two retirees. As a result, mi-
norities will make up an

  increasingly large percent-
 'j  386 of the work force.

“As the labor pool con-

»_, Ii tracts and the demographic
'5 ‘V; factor takes effect, by the
, year 2000, six of ten people

entering the work force will
be minorities and immi-
grants,” Wharton said. He

‘added that although age
' caps‘ have been removed,

most people still retire at
age 65. _ ’

“I don't believe that as a
society we have found a
creative way’ to tap the
enormous intellectual ca-
pacity of the large group of
retired people.”

According to Wharton,
one of the foremost prob-
lerns that will face this
generation of graduates is
growing trade and budget
deficits. Wharton also cited
numerous environmental
problems, including acid

, rain and the greenhouse

effect, as important concerns
for this year’s graduating
class. ‘

Wharton's primary con-
cern, however, centered on
what he perceived to be a
decrease of investment in
education, especially for
blacks and other minori-
ties. Wharton said that he
feels education is the key
for the United States to be
able to cope’ with an aging
population and urged
graduates to- support a
higher quality of education.

“You of all people must
realize the value of an
education,” he said. “You

iPa.'s Walgren puts oil

spill act before Congress

By Lou Grieco
News Editor

The Tank Spill Pre-
vention Act of 1989, a
bill designed to regulate
above-ground storage
tanks, has been intro-
duced in the U.S. Con-
gress after last month’s
Exxon oil spill in Alaska.

The bill was submit-

. ted by US. Rep. Doug

Walgren, D-Pa., on April
20. Walgren introduced
a similar bill last year
after the Ashland oil spill
in Pittsburgh, but Con-
gress adjourned for the
elections before the bill
could be voted on.
“The Exxonspill has
given added importance
to this issue,” said Jon
Delano, Walgren’s chief
of staff. “I think we can
be reasonably optimistic
that some kind of bill
will be passed in the
101st Congress”,
Walgren’s bill would
require a spill and leak
prevention for each tank,
and names the ‘Environ-

mental Protection Agency
as the regulating agency.
The tank owners would
be required to have an
engineer, independent of
the company, inspect the
tanks every three years,
and file a certificate of
inspection with the EPA.
The companies would
also be responsible for
cleaning up in the event
of .a spill. The EPA would
also oversee the cleanup
activities, and the costs
would be paid out of a

government fund that the ‘

companies would have to
pay into.

“The fund would come
from taxes paid by the

companies, based on size -

and number of tanks,”

Delano said. “They would . i

be totally responsible for
cleanup. It isn’t fair to
make the average taxpayer
foot the bill when it wasn't
his fault.”

Delano said that
Walgren anticipates
bipartisan support for
the bill. Sen. George

Mitchell, D-Maine, now

no withdrawals since the
neon statue was purchased
in 1987 for the Pitt bicenten-
nial. The statue cost $30,000.
“Fifty percent of what-
ever we have in the fund
must be retained in case of
overallocating, or a budget
deficit,” Borok said. “How-
ever, I’d like to do some-
thing beneficial for the entire
university with the rest of the
money. The other 50 per-
cent can be used to make

budget reforms that are
necessary.”
Every year, the fund

grows due to the transfer of
money from the activities fee
that is not allocated to stu-
dent groups, and allocated

of Borok’s plan would in-
clude a “ceiling figure.” If-
the amount of money in
the fund surpasses the
ceiling figure, the Alloca-
tions Committee can use
the rest of the money in
the following year’s
budget.

One of the major areas
of budget reform that
Borok cited as crucial is
athletic programs. Because
many sports programs are
not recognized by the
athletic department, the
funding for them comes
from the Allocations Com-
mittee.

“The majority of non-
varsity sports clubs are

selves,” Borok said. “This
involves very high expen-
ditures. We can’t give them
what they justly deserve.”

Borok said that if his
program becomes a real-
ity, there is a possibility
that there may be increases
in the allocations to all
student groups. The in-
creases would be propor-
tional to what the groups
receive now."

Other reforms pro-

posed by Borok include
ways to improve the pres-
ent allocations process,
including improving the
relationships. between al-
locations liaisons and the
leaders of the student

1 THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, May IO, I989

By Erik Kridle
Assistant News Editor

A 50,000-member group
called Fundamentalists
Anonymous announced a
boycott of all Pepsi prod-
ucts last week at Pepsi’s

I annual shareholders meet-
ing. I .
According to Jim Luce,
an executive member of the
group, they have decided
to show their disapproval
of Pepsi’s decision to drop
its Madonna ad campaign
by boycotting Pepsi prod-
ucts, and hence “impacting
[Pepsi’s] bottom line.”
One fundamentalist
Christian organization, the
American Family Associa-
tion, under the leadership
Don
Wildmon, threatened
’ stage a boycott of all Pepsi
products if the Madonna
commercial was not re-
moved from the air when
the commercial first ap-
peared.

Fundamentalists Anony- I

mous believes Pepsi bowed
to \X/ildmon’s demands.

Luce saidthat it is “very, _
very dangerous for corpo— 
rate America to bend to

fundamentalist pressure.”
The world premiere of
rock star Madonna’s latest
song, “Like a Prayer,” in the
'_ form of a Pepsi-Cola televi-

. sion commercial on March

2 was preceded by an entire
month of hype by Pepsi.‘ It
was advertised as a history-
rnaking event. It would be
the first ad of itskind in the
history of advertising.

 

[0,

But something went
wrong.

On March 3, after
airing the commercial
twice nationally, Pepsico
Inc. decided to pull the
commercial from the

airwaves. Pepsi’s sponsor-

ship of Madonna’s up-
coming tour was also put
in question.

The problems began

- for Pepsi the day after

Pepsi released its com-
mercial, when Madonna’s
video to “Like a Prayer”
appeared for the first time
on MTV. T hat’s when the
controversy began, and

action was quickly taken,
according to Todd McK-
enzie, a Pepsi advertising
spokesman.

“We had hoped by
putting time and distance
between our commercial
and her video, we might
clear up for many people
what we sponsored and
didn’t sponsor,” McKenzie
said.

He claims that people
were confusing the con-
tent of the commercial
with that of Madonna’s
music video, which many
people were finding
religiously offensive.

feature Madonna dancing

McKenzie said local
TV news broadcasts were .
largely responsible for
this confusion, because
of repeated story cover-

music video and the
commercial together in
the same sequence.

“Personally, I thought

the section of the public
which found thevideo of-

Nevertheless, Luce said
he believes otherwise.

“It ran twice, and they
pulled it because the funda-

tentof the ad,” Luce said.

McKenzie said the Fun-

boycott is “based on Rev]

cess.” He denounces Fun-

claim that Pepsi gave into
the threats of the AFA.

“They’re going to start going

of television programs.” '
In fact, Luce said, they

The Pittsburgh mayoral race
is like watching Star Search

The race for mayor has shown little in the way of merit
to distinguish it from any other campaign of the last 15
years. It seems to have descended to the same level as any
other. A Pittsburgh Post-Gazette poll has shown that

_ Mayor Sophie Masloff has turned around in the polls. In

early April, County Controller Frank Lucchino held a sub-
stantial lead over Masloff. The Post-Gazette attributes the
change to the advent of Masloffs slick TV commercial
spots which play up her connection with Richard Caligiuri.

While Lucchino and Masloff ﬂash their teeth at each
other over the airwaves, there is one man, whose cam-
paign is not sufficiently funded to provide for his TV
debut, but has nevertheless shown a capacity for improv-
ing and expanding the Pittsburgh economy, as well as
showing a 5-point gain in the polls since early April. This

3 man is Thomas Murphy, currently a state representative.

His face is unknown to many, but his plans could affect
many of us as college students and soon-to-be graduates.
He is interested-not merely in keeping a slow pace with
little policy change, but in development — specifically,
creating jobs and opportunities within universities, hospi-

- tals and the arts. He has already had success with such

Q1

programs. His Strategy 21 program, working with the city,
county and universities, resulted in $200 million in state
funds for Allegheny County. His plans focus on the
strength that we, the college community, give to the city,
and if successful, Murphy’s plans could make places like
the University of Pittsburgh better for learning.

The occult and Violence

On Tbe Morton Downeyjr. Sbow, one man blamed it
on women having careers and being bad mothers. Mort
himself suggested that it was because of television and
"motion pictures. In the Pittsburgh Post—Gazette, a corre-
spondent blamed Saturday morning cartoons for being
full of magic and witchcraft. Parents’ groups seem to en-
joy blarning heavy metal rock music and rock music in
general. ' .

All of these people are trying to find a reason why
young people are increasingly obsessed with violence,
and especially violence in connection with the occult. All
of‘ them are overlooking a more obvious reason.

In our world of violence and war, with economic
stresses and the fear of nuclear war plaguing us, it is not
unexpected that those who are more sensitive to these
stresses should become unbalanced, turning to the super- ‘
natural for comfort and to violence for catharsis. Oc-
cultism and violence are not necessarily linked. This crisis
of the mind should not be a vehicle for those who wish
to blame and suppress trends that they. personally object
to. Instead, these “crusaders” would be well advised to
focus on-helping those who are vulnerable to the stressful
facts of modern life and subject toabuse’ and rejection by

both these righteous crusaders and their own families and '
peers. -An ounce of preventive medicine to our children i

Rape: a personal perspective

They say that rape vic-
tims often experience feel-
ings of guilt, responsibility,
mistrust, depression and low
self—esteem. However, in my
personal experience, this
did not happen. I waited
and waited, but I felt noth-
ing.

In my freshman year at
Pitt, 1 was raped by a fellow
student at an apartment
party. As a consequence of
this, I may-notbe able to

have children.

The following year was
the worst of my life. I didn’t
feel scummy or ugly— I felt
nothing. Just empty and
numb. Almost dead. Look-
ing back now, it seems as if
I was walking around in a
cloud, avoiding everything
that was once important to
me.

This numbness, I later
found out, was caused by
an inability to accept that

.what had happened to me

was rape. I could talk to
people about that night, but
I could not discuss my feel-
ings, because I honestly
didn’t know what I felt.

_ This apathetic numbness
continued for almost a year,
which was way too long. I
finally realized that I had to
do something about it. No
one else was going to do it
for me.

I was advised not to
prosecute my attacker, due
to the circumstances. There
were no witnesses or con-
crete evidence. Alcohol was
involved. It was likely that
I’d be asked demeaning,

personal questions in court, '

and I didn’t feel emotion-
ally strong enough to handle
it at that point.

Even if I couldn’t do
anything about him, I found
I could do something about
myself. I decided not to let
this beat me, evenif it meant
experiencing all of the ugly
feelings that I had heard
about

And Iidid. The guilt and
insecurity were much worse
than I imagined. I spent
countless nights awake,
crying, thinking or writing.
I went through. a time where

I was terrified of leaving the ,

house by myself. Since my
grades had been steadily

declining, I withdrew from
classes for

a while. I lost

 
 

. itwoj.obs'.. , j    J . 

After a few months, I
knew I had to find a way to
rebuild my self-confidence.
I took a serious" look at my
priorities. For example, I
was doing some modeling
work and was interested in
acting. How was I supposed
to play “sexy” when I felt
like I wanted to melt into
the wall when anyone
looked at me? And how can
love and relationships be
important when you feel
unlovable and unable to
love?

So, for the time being, I
set my sights on other things.
I concentrated on my hob-
bies — artwork, poetry and
fitness. Since I spent a good
deal. of time at home, I
thought I’d try to become
closer to my mother.

And slowly but surely, I
began to see that I still had
some talents, some friends
and some hope.

‘From then on, every-
thing was easier. Sometimes
I’d slip back into depres-
sion, but I never let it last
longer than a couple of days.
I started going out more
and more and even started
dating again. After a -year
and a half, I finally felt like
myself again._

, Then something else
happened. I became very
moody. I started experienc-
ing feelings of intense an-
ger and hate. I thought of
finding and confronting the
guy, but I seriously doubted
that -angry words would
make much of an impres-
sion on a person like him.
' Iwonder if he did this to
anyone ‘else. I wonder if
he’s reading this article. It’s
kind of scary to think that
the guy sitting next to you

in class might be a rapist.

Contrary to popular belief,

most rapists are not big,
hairy and ugly. They are
people who feel weak. By
using force to have sex,
they get a feeling of power
and superiority. . 
If my assailant happens
to read this, I’m sure he’ll
remember a blonde girl who
was his “friends” date. My
anger for him has been re-
placed with something
deeper. And that is pure
pity and disgust for him and
anyone else who would
stoop so low. To me, he is

on the same level as a, '
murderer. A murderer kills '

physically, while a rapist
attacks emotionally, leav-

ing the body intact. To .

anyone else who has under-
gone a similar experience:
you are not alone. One out
of six women will go
through this in her time at
college.

Barbara Bensur, of Pitts-
burgh Action Against Rape,
said “People don’t want to
believe this stuff is happen-
ing. In this way, rape is dif-

ferent than any other vi_o-,, _
lent crime". It is the only one I 
in which the victim feels re- '

sponsible.”
Some words from Billy
Joel helped me to get over

the irrational guilt that.I_felt:_« 
“Some people hope for a ' 
miracle cure, some people  

just accept the world as it is.

I'm not willing to lay down .  ‘ii-
and die, because I am an in- _f'{

nocent man.”

They call people who
have been the victim of al; ’

violent crime,‘such as rape,
“survivors.” Now I know.
why. ‘

Pitt's men’s track team
continued its impressive
1989 outdoor track cam-
paign by winning the Big
East Conference Champi-
onship last weekend at
Villanova. The two—day
track meet ended with Pitt
outdistancing second-place
Syracuse, 135-1215.

“We had a super week-
end. It was a great team
performance,” said Pitt
head coach john Vasvary.

“It was one of those times
when you couldn’t quit or
give up at the end of a
race, and we just did eve-
rything right.”

Pitt was led by All-

who posted a victory in the
110-meter hurdles with a
time of 13.85, and com-
bined with Neil Malobicky,

200 dash.
“Eric was our catalyst.

He was in the center of
everything that happened,”
said Vasvary. “He was in
that position going in, so
he had that burden on him.
He certainly lived up to
everything he was sup-
posed to do, maybe even
more.” I

Some of Pitt’s weaker
events were held on Satur-
day, and as a result, they
fell behind early to
Syracuse and Georgetown.
In fact, Pitt was in sixth
place after the first day of
competition. The Panthers

did manage a 3,000 stee-
plechase victory from Paul
Friedrich on Saturday.

However, Pitt scored
points in 12 of the 15 events
held on Sunday to roar
back for the championship.
The ‘javelin, 110 hurdles,
and the 400 hurdles events
provided big points for the
Panthers.

Defensive end Burt

Even though he suffered
through the season with a
nagging ankle injury, his

‘draft status certainly did

ahead of the game.”

Linebacker Jerry

‘Olsavsky, who led the

Panthers with 129 tackles
last year, wasalso chosen
by the Steelers. Olsavsky

‘was taken in the tenth

round, the 259th selection
overall. He is relatively small
(6-0, 217 pounds) compared
to other professional line-
backers, however his foot-
ball instincts may lead him
to a successful pro career,
according to Noll.
“Olsavsky is the guy that
everybody says is too small,

but he was probably the
best linebacker on the field
at the East-West Shrine
game,” said Noll. “He just
has a way of getting the job
done. He’s an extremely
intelligent young man who
plays with great leverage.
He just gets the job done.”
Pitt’s All-American guard
Mark Stepnoski was the first
pick in the third round of
the draft. Stepnoski went to
the Dallas Cowboys as the
57th overall pick. Stepnoski
is a four year letter man for
the Panthers ' and was
awarded the ‘ Blue-Gold
award for outstanding ath-

letic and academic achieve-

ment.
Tight end Vernon Kirk

and cornerback Cornell

Holloway were also taken
on draft day. Kirk, who
caught six passes for Pitt last
year, was picked up in the
ninth round by the Los

Angeles Rams. Holloway was '
taken by the Cincinatti Ben--
gals in the tenth round.'

Holloway had two intercep-
