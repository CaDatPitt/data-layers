SIDEWALK SANTAS ILLEGAL

OWENSBORO, Ky. (AP)———
Sidewalk Santas may be illegal here
unless the city commission revises a
1924 ordinance originally aimed at
Ku Klux K-lansmen and recently
used to justify the arrest of two
“Martians.”

The law prohibits. any i‘-‘a’s_sem'.-
iblage of persons” in public “with
masks over their faces or'other
covering devide which conceals
their identity." It was cited last
August in the arrest of two young
people who played a practical joke
on a friend by dressing up as
Martians—complete with alumin-
um masks, gloves and antennae.

' ‘The ?law ‘ doesn't ~speciﬁcally*- 

prohibit’ people dressed as Santa

Claus from the streets of the

western Kentucky community, but
City Atty. Larry Harrington says: “I
would "say this—-if it prohibits
Martians it prohibits Santa Clauses,

too." He said the act could cover
groups of Halloween trick-or-

treaters as well.

NEWS BRIEFS  

A COMING ATTRACTION:
COMPUTERIZED HEART

MOVIES

WASHINGTON (AP)——Scien-
tists have developed a method of
making computer-reconstructed
movies of the heart while a patient
vigorously
they say can’t be done with
standard ways of making internal
heart pictures. -

The National Institutes of Health
researchers say the technique also
is much less expensive, painful and
dangerous to the patient than other
forms of angiography, as cardiac
picture-taking is called.

In a report to be delivered

Monday in Miami at an American '

Heart Association meeting, the
researchers said, pictures taken
while the heart exercises can reveal
problems not evident when it is at
rest.

With traditional angiography, an
incision is made into an artery in the
arm or leg and a tube is pushed
through the vessel into the
chambers of the heart. ‘

Either a contrast dye is put into



  

exercises—somethin g ‘

beer that m

the heart through the tube and
X-ray pictures taken, or a radioac-
tive isotope is used instead of dye
and images made from radioactive
emissions.

Dr. Jeffrey S. Borer, a senior
cardiology scientist at the National
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute,
and Dr. Stephen L. Bacharach and
Michael V. Green of NlH’s Clinical
Center say their method will replace
or at least supplement the older
techniques. '

The new method requires inject-
ing a protein containing a small
amount of a short-lived radioactive
isotope into almost any vein. A few
minutes later, an instrument that
measures radioactivity is placed on
the left side of the patient’s chest.

A computer registers each point
of radioactivity in the heart every
10-thousandths of a second and
builds a three-dimensional picture
thatappears on a television screen.

“We essentially play one picture
after another and make a movie,”
Borer said in an interview. ,

African Play Hits Issues

BY LEN ROMBERG

Is it difﬁcult to picture a place
where the majority of the population
is treated as if they were
cub-human, where those people
must carry a passbook to enter or
‘:eave a city, and where it is a crime
to be outside after a certain hour or
just to leave town?

In South Africa that situation is
-‘suite real. The majority black
population lives in an oppressed
gtate under inhuman physical and
emotional conditions.

We on the outside can not be kept
blind to these unfortunate facts.
Awareness and criticism of such
practices must be pursued if
problems of oppression and racism
are to ever disappear. This is one
issue raised at the Pittsburgh Public
Theatre’s current production Sizwe
Bansi Is Dead.

In the opening scene, we see why

“awareness,” the first step in .

solving a problem, is such a difficult
step to reach. The place is a Ford
Motors assembly line in South
Africa. The working conditions are
reminiscent of Chicago at the turn of
the century, and the people in the
work force, entirely black, earn an
average of $10 a month.

It is announced that Henry Ford
from American will be visiting the
factory. The plant is cleansed from
top to bottom, the workers
showered and the pace of produc-
tion is slowed to a tolerable level.
Ford arrives, never notices any-
thing wrong, leaves, and once again
the workers are pushed beyond
human limits to make up lost
production.

The play is staged in the round
with a rather simple setting, leaving

most of the
imagination. Wooden boards and
sawdustcover the stage ﬂoor. An
old _tire, a smashed barrel, and an
old water spicket are also on stage.

The two actors who continue to
tell the story of Sizwe Bansi are Joe
Morton and Joe Seneca, both ﬁne
actors who give top rate perfor-
mances from beginning to end.
Morton displays excellent com-
mand of the stage, reaching all
sections of the audience, never
alienating anyone. This makes the
theater in the round an assetin the
production.

Black playwrights Winston

Pgh. Opera Premiers  
Over the Weekend

or PAMELA EUSI

The Pittsburgh Opera premiered
this past weekend with the tragic
opera Tosca, under the direction of
guest conductor Anton Guadagno.

Tosca by Giacomo Puccini is an
opera about the love of two people
among a world of evil, lust and
cruelty. It is considered by many to
be Puccini's greatest work and
when played as it was this weekend
it is Puccini's best. ‘ *

Stage director James Lucas did a
good job in the direction of the stars
and chorus for the production.
There were a couple of moments of
upstaging but with a large cast
onstage a few rough moments will
occur.

Sets were very ably done by
Isolde Schwarz and the sensitive
lighting design by Thomas Struth-
ers deﬁned the moods of the acts
and highlighted the powerful
emotions especially the charge from
nighttime to sunrise in Act III.

19th century costumes by Mala-
bar helped to examine further the
characters and put on a pretty show
as well.

Maralin Niska as the beautiful
opera singer Floria Tosca sang her
role with grace and passion. The

dramatics were overdone but’

Niska’s vocal quality allowed one to

\ .

I

overlook that aspect. Her projec-
tion, tonalities and emotional
contrasts made her Tosca a tragic
and courageous ﬁgure.

The role of Tosca’s lover, the
painter Mario Covaradossi, was

played by Barry Morell. His tenor‘ .

range and emotional appeal lent
credibility to the heroics of
Cavaradossi.

Something always comes be-

-tween the perfect lovers in the

theater. In Tosca it was the desires
of Baron Scarpia, played by Thomas
Tipton, for the lovely’ Tosca.
Scarpia’s villain was not the
quivering, sniveling type, just an
ordinary man with a lot of power

used to getting what he wants. The ‘

villainy in the man stems from the‘
evil he is capable of getting away
with because of his power. Tipton’s
low range was ampliﬁed by the evil
quality in the orchestral music.
Puccini as a young man attended
a production of Victorien Sardou’s
popular French play La Tosca which
was written for Sarah Bernhardt.
He liked the play and wanted it for
an opera but he had to wait for years
until with the aid of the great

libretto team Giuseppe Giacosa and ‘

Luigi Illicajthe opera Tosca came
into being.

the race problem as South african
citizens. Director Woodie King’s
interpretation of their play is
tremendous. ‘

Most of the ﬁrst act centers inside
a photographic studio owned by
Styles, a black man. He has
somehow worked his way up from
being a factory worker to being a
proprietor.

Joe Morton acts a sensitive story
about a man whose dream was to be
his own boss, own his own building,
and operate his own business.
Unfortunately, these can only he
dreams, for his story is just a dream,
nothing more.

The problem with act one is that it
stretches for too long a time,
postponing the meaningful and
dramatically climactic point in the
second act. During the ﬁrst scene,
the audience hears several good
stories but they do not add enough
significance to the remainder of the
play.

At the end of act one,‘ a well
dressed man walks into the studio
for a picture. Later we ﬁnd out he
was Sizwi Bansi, a poor, unemploy-
ed black man who is a victim of his

Elton John Scores  
New Heights With LP

BY TOM WASELESKI

Blue Moves, Elton John.
MCA/ Rocket Records, 2'-11004

This is the long-awaited, ultimate
Elton John album. None of his
previous albums were ever this
good (that includes Madman,
Yellow Brick Road and the ﬁrst
one), and he may never produce
another like it.

As if that weren’t enough, it ends
a long skid of disposable, adoles-
cent albums, and is two disks long.
There’s a lot here to chew on: 18
songs (he writes ’em long), three of
which are excellent instrumentals.

The guests abound: Graham
Nash,David_ Crosby, Toni Tennille,
the Brecker Brothers, David San-
born, the - London Symphony
Orchestra, the Martyn Ford Orches-

tra, the Gene Page Strings. the

Cornerstone Institutional Baptist
and Southern California Commun-
ity Choir.

v They have their effect, but even

without them Elton John has a
blockbuster of an album to take into
his newly proclaimed semi-retire-
ment.

A lot of the cuts sound like steals
off previous albums." “Cage the
Songbird’ ’ is shimmeringly acoustic
[Captain Fantastic], “Shoulder

Holster” has an echoing vocal.

reminiscent of the Elton .John
album, “Where’s the Shoorah?” is
heavily gospel. (Tumbleweed . Con-
nection), “Someone’s Final Song”
has the melodic simplicity and
power that made Madman a
monster record, and “Crazy

Water” is enough to appease those ’

who enjoyed the corruptible in-
ﬂuence disco had on Rock of the
Westies. _

Picking the best track here
depends on the kind of Elton John
stuff you like. In this two-record set
he does the full range, from tough
rockers to melancholy ballads, and
this time, even jazz. '

Famous designers from all

Expectations led many people to
believe that models would do a

in their ﬁne array. Fortunately,
this premise proved false.

Each movement graced the
Heinz Hall stage with dance
numbers performed by members of
the Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre and/
the Mannequin’s Guild of Pitts-
burgh. The modeling was a greatly
toned down version of the
preceeding dance.

“Tonight,” which has to be one of
Elton’s most moving pieces. The
London Symphony proves the crude
limitations of synthesizers in
providing lush background.

- 'l'he lyrics are poignant enough,
too, as they are throughout the

album, and lyricist Bernie Taupin’s ,

repetition of the title is effective:
“Tonight/ Why not approach with
less defiance/The man who'd love

you smile/Tonight.“

“Chameleon” ﬁnds Elton in the
best vocal shape ever. He seems to
be singing from the gut instead of
just from the throat, giving his
words more force, his inﬂections
more variety.

The closer, “Bite Your Lip (Get
Up and Dance),” is the bawdiest
rocker he’s done since “Saturday
Night's Alright.” He charges into
an extended refrain at the end
which must be second in length only
to “Hey Jude’s” la—la-las.

The album is amazingly, complex.
Listen to it on a cheap machine, then
turn it on to full stereo or quad, and
it’s a different.record. There are
layers and layers of sound here, so
much so that the total package,
right down to _ the artsy cover
painting, is _indicative of _the
untapped potential of Elton John.

Recover (or retire) from the stage
_if he must, but don't let him stop
writing. Ifhevcan produce another

be too happy to wait.

 

Johnny me Fox LP 

\ -

Almost Stacks Ups E

_ BY JIM FARERI

One of the acid test "for an
upcoming rock group is to top their
previous release. When a band is
just this side of stardom, without a
huge following or dynamic record
sales, they must renew their star
status with each LP they make. It’s
either this or back to being third
billed nobodys.

So is the case with Britan’s Thin
Lizzy. Jailbreak, their first 1976
album, was a tight, name-breaking
rock album. Before it the band had
a minuscule U.S. following, now
they're big enough to headline in
the smaller big-city concert ‘halls.

Whether or not Johnny The Fox
stacks up ..with Jailbreak is a close
one to call. The new LP seems to
go slack where the last one came on
strong, mainly in the punch and

quantity of Lizzy’s rhythm ravaged.

rock’n roll. s

Most of side one has its roots in
Jailbreak. '

“Johnny." opens the album with
dead ahead rock, but rather laid
back for a first cut. The use of
horns, blending in with the rhythm
at the song's end, seems to me a

sterile innovation.
follows the best track on ‘,‘,Johnny
The Fox by merit of its lambasting
beat. , 
“Borderline" is a standard

blues-rock song made plausible by .,

good guitar work. The same

remedy helped to save the weaker .

cuts on the last" LP.

Side two sets Johnny The Fox at 

odds with its predecessor.

lt pumps as much energy into a .

‘song as possible, making it
impossible to keep up with but still
elusively alluring. The occasional

spurts of synthesized guitar add to“

its new, undeﬁnable quality.

What the album boils down to is  
a combination of fine new "

innovative music along with some
ﬁne old Jailbreak rock. On side one
Thin Lizzy continues to break their
name; on two they break musical
ice--successfully.

Trying out your talents in a new
vein is never easy, especially when
yourfuture is at stake. But Thin
Lizzy is doing it. Don’t forget‘ to
catch their debut Pittsburgh
performance at the Stanley Theatre
on Nov. 30.

BY STEVE SYBERT
Sports Editor

Une ofthe prerequisites of being
the nation's top-ranked team,’ as in
the case of the Pitt Panthers, is to

have an offense and a defense

which play consistently well, but
also are able to make up for the
other if one should happen to
sputter.

ln Pitt's 24-lb emotion-packed A

win over the West Virginia
Mountaineers at Pitt Stadium on
Saturday, the Panther -offense
wasn't exactly shut down-—it
amassed .399 total’ yards, with
tailback Tony Dorsett (199 yards on
.36 carries) and quarterback Matt
Cavanaugh_(l24 on 19) leading the
way.‘ Nevertheless, it coughed up
the football eight times and lost five
of those fumbles to a team which
had one thought in mind all day
long-—to upset the number one
Panthers, who held on and raised
their record to 10-0, the most wins '
ever in the history of Pitt football.
vAnd WVU cold have pulled an

‘upset if they had been able to

capitalize on the five Pitttturnovers,
but the Panther defense saved the
day by holding Mountain.eer
runners to only 99 yards rushing
and the entire offense to only 169
total yards. _

to say the ‘least, it was your
typical Pitt-WVU struggle—-a situ-

 

'l:asley.. WVU‘ quarterback Dan

"Oh my God, what a game,’

“tarly in the half, I_ felt we were the

we hurt ourselves more than

that our offenses execution wasn't

on the scoreboard.

Starting their second series of the
game from their own'32-yard line,
the Panthers needed only eight
plays to march downfield and take a
/-U lead in the middle of the first
period. After two short gains by
Dorsett, Cavanaugh, who later
injured both his elbow and
shoulder,“passed to tight end Jim
Corbett and split end Willie Taylor
for gains of nine and 12 yards,
respectively. ~ 9

Cavanaugh then pitched straigh

’ back to Dorsett, who fought for 11

yards down the left sideline to the
Mountaineer 30. After Cavanaugh

pushed to the 22 and fullback Bob

to the 17, Dorsett took a pitch from
‘ Cavanaugh to the right, turned

upfield and racedfpast a bewildered

Pitt's first touchdown. Long's extra-

point was good, making. the senior “

Pitt drove 69 yards in ten plays on

to a 0-0 deadlock. -But as the young
team headed for their locker room
for the last time this year, they did
so with anew-found realization of

Dorsett Steals Show
In Final Performance

BY RON SIEGEL

"l ony Dorsett’s final performance

/ at Pitt Stadium Saturday, like his

entire four-year career, will notﬂie

‘soon forgotten. ln the pregame and

throughout the game, it was the
lony Dorsett Show.

Dorsett, who rushed for 199 yards
and three touchdowns to lead Pitt to

a hard-fought 24-16 victory over '

arch-rival West Virginia, set the

tempo for the game during the‘

player introductions.

When the NCAA's ’all-time
leading rusher was introduced, he
raised his finger to indicate that Pitt
is number one, just as his
teammates had done. l-le didn't
stop there ,_ however. Dorsett turned‘
to face the West Virginia bench,
showing the Mountaineers that Pitt

, was number brie, and gesturing for

them to come over and get him.

it he Mountaineers began jump-
ing up and down on the sidelines,
like so many gorillas trapped in a
cage waiting to be let out. When the
game began, West Virginia at-
tempted to key on Dorsett, just as
every other Pitt opponent has for
the last four seasons. ’

lhey just didn't want Tony to
carry the ‘ball period,"- said
quarterback Matt Cavanaugh, who
took advantage -of the situation to
rush for 124 yards, the best ﬁgure of
his career. '

Dorsett did get the ball, and
easily rushed for over l(_)0yards' for
the 32nd time in his career. ‘

Archie Griffin's NCAA rushing
record at Navy three weeks
previously will be placed in the
trophy case at the Pitt‘Field House.

"This is one of the things I'll
cherish the most for the ‘rest of my
life," said Dorsett after the game. . '
“Pitt has been playing football for a‘ .3
long time, and no one ever had their ~ V” '
jerseyretired. This meansa helluva ‘ ‘ ' _
lot to me and my family." A  "S

the excitement was not over for‘
Dorsett. Called upon continuously
to run out the clock and protect
Pitt's eight-point lead, Dorsett took ‘
exception to being speared by a
Mountaineer after he was tackled in
front of the Pitt bench.

Dorsett got up and ﬁred the
football at the WVU player, and a.-
brawl involving both benchesf
erupted. Dorsett was thrown out of
the game, and the offsetting“ V _
penalties on the play lost him the’ U  -
yardage he needed to tie the NCAA  1
record for consecutive 200-yard 
performances. The record of three,‘

held by Bill Marek of Wisconsin and
John Capelletti of Penn -State, is _
one thaf‘Dorsett _won’t break or tie.  _

Pitt water polo coach Miguel
Rivera hoped his watch was
waterproof and didn't mind his
clothes and wallet becoming
thoroughly drenched Saturday
night. No, Rivera didn't walk into a
shower; it was just his team’s way
of showing its appreciation by
tossing him into Trees Pool, where
the Panther water polo squad had
just captured the Eastern Champ-
ionship.

It was the culmination of the
season for the Panthers and Rivera,
who said, though his 19-3 polomen
