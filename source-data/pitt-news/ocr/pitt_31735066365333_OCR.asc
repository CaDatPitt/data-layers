. Chancellor Explores Forbes Stall Leaders’ Impeachment

The Forbes Phase I Project.
mergers within the Health Pro-
fessions, the University's subsidy
55,- from the State Legislature, and
" " the Annual Giving Fund were
among the items discussed at Fri-
day’s Board of Trustees meeting.

The meeting also marked the
first time a Trustees conference
was open to the press, including
Pitt News staffers.

Ironically. the Trustee meeting
that liberal students of a few
years ago pressed vigorously to
attend turned out to be a rather
average one, with few surprising
issues coming up.

Of primary interest to student
observers was Chancellor Wesley
Posvar’s report on ‘the Forbes
area development, bottled in de-
bate since summer. According to

 Posvar, a “semantic problem”

i has arisen in relation to the Uni-
versity’s offer to “suspend exist-
ing plans” for Forbes Phase I.

“I didn’t feel that the agreement
to suspend the plans was a com-
mitment for destruction of those

r plans," said the Chancellor. "In
looking at the various options,
those previous plans should be

_ considered as one of those options.

la. “Within the framework of com-
munity planning, they should be
considered as a_ primary option.
and I personally favor that op-
gtion."

Posvar discussed the progress
with the three other parties--the
state, the city, and the commun-
ity—in Forbes negotiations. The
state, he said, is running out of

D patience, as each week of delay
costs it $80,000.
come an end to the state’s willing-
ness to let this kind of thing go
on,” he speculated.

The city, he explained. will not
accept any plans unless there is
community support of them. Pos-
var said he can find “no operation-
al definition of community." He
added. “In other words. we don’t
know the names of the players or
the rules of the game."

As far as the community is con-
cerned. Posvar plans to appoint a
standing advisory committee
from all constituencies concerned
with University expansion.

3 I “Progress has been extremely
disappointing,” he added. “The
GSA (General State Authority) is
deciding what they want to do and
how soon they want to do it.”

Posvar also mentioned Univer-
sity cuts, forced by a $3 million
slash from the state. which. he
said. was "painful but not fatal to
our program. This isn't all bad.
The austerity that concerns Penn-
sylvania doesn‘t mean we're fac-
ing disaster——it means the per-
iod of unlimited growth is at an
end."

The University got about $40
million from the state. compared
to the $43.2 million in the Gov-
ernor's budget for Pitt before the
graduated income tax was ruled

 unconstitutional.

. HOSPITALS DISCUSSED‘
Several changes were proposed
-A in local hospitals and health-re-

 

“There must '

lated areas. The possibility of
building a bridge between West-

ern Pennsylvania Psychiatric In-I

stitute and Presbyterian—Univer-
sity Hospital. to promote co-op-
eration between the two. was
mentioned. '

Improved transportation facil-
ities between Magee Women's
Hospital and Children’s Hospital,
which both concentrate on care
for the young, was discussed with
the city.

In the planning stages is a new
nursing building. to be built over
the parking garage on Lothrop St.

Additionally. the Arsenal School,
formerly part of the Medical
School, will now rely on the School
of General Studies for its basic
support.

The Budget-Audit Committee
noted that for the fiscal year end-
ing June 30 of thisyear, the Uni-

I

versity has $1,879,000 _in debits
over receipts, these not being af-
fected by later income such-as the
tuition increase. It was not known
if these losses will be considered
by the state in its next appropria-
tion. '

Twenty’ million dollars is’ due
from the legislature. as the sec-
ond installment of Pitt‘s budget.
by the end of the year.

The meeting ended with a pro-
jectoral presentation by Allen
Kent. director of the Office of
Communications Programs and
the Knowledge Availability, Sys-
tems Center.»

Following the meeting. the trus-
tees, chaired by William Rea. at-
tended a ‘dedication of the David
H. Kurtzman Room in the Student
Union. formerly known as the
Supper Room.

 

THE COMMUTER ASSOCIATION will sponsor a Coffee House from 2-

’ 5 p.m. Friday in Dining Room A of the Student Union. That same day
it will also sponsor a Cook-Out in Schenley Park from 6-10 p.m.

Petitions   Demantl SA

by EVAN PATTAK
Associate Editor

A group of disgruntled students
has circulated petitions aimed at
the impeachment of the four Stu-
dent Association Commissioners
and members of the Social Com-
mission. ’

‘Since Thursday. the Students
Actively for Effective Student
Government have asked students
to sign petitions calling for the
impeachment of Social Commis-
sioner Lenny Klavonic. Programs
Commissioner Dennis Concilla.
Committees Commissioner Wade
Lawson. and Academic Commis-
sioner Ted Michalik. In addition,
the petitions ask the impeachment
of Social Commission members
Arnold Steinberg. Lee Elder. Lar-
ry Schaefferl Lee Clabots. and
Linda Milovats. . - ~

Joseph Forbes. chairman of the
group. said that 621 signatures
had been gathered as of yesterday
evening. The number required to
initiate impeachment proceed-
ings is set by the SA Constitution
at five per cent of the undergrad-
uate student body. Estimates of
the total undergraduate enroll-
ment range from 15-20 thousand.

Perpetuation of Sexism Explored

by SUE HOENSTINE

It is a male chavinist's, night-
mare. He walks into a-history
class with a student ratioof eight
women to one man; the women
are talking about things he can
barely comprehend. For example.
"Historically, money has been a
symbol of power for men. Money.
when it belongs to women and is
earned by women. has the power

to einasculate and destroy." the
lecturer says. The student reels
and walks out. regretting his in-
tentions of enrolling in a women‘s
studies course at Pitt.

Explaining why she chose to
designed a major in women's

studies and religion. Cathi l{itts'

said. "It‘s important to know how
traditions have been perpetuated.
I want to find out how institutions
have politically prevented women
from gaining power."

Last week. Marcia Landy told
her women‘s literature class.
"'I‘m not quite sure what it means
to inhabit the word 'woman."

I

»‘ .- ll.’-

  

 

She was responding to a re-
mark from a bearded student who
said, “I think you women here are
in a minority. There are still lots
of women who would be compli-
mented by the word ‘chick.”

The discussion rolled with re-
marks. “How‘d you like it if I_call-
ed you an intelligent prick?" one
student retorted. "But it depends
who’s using the word—the con-
text." a male replied.

Raising her index finger to her
glasses. Landy stated. “When I
think of a chick. I think of some-
thing furry. someone who needs
to be protected. and probably
someones who‘s doomed ‘to be
roasted. '

“It is words that are impor-
tant,.” Landy" continued. “If we
are going to communicate we
must have words. And we do in-
habit the terms that are applied
to us.”_

From studying the Bible, Ovid's
Metamorphoses, and other myths
Landy hopes to explore the atti-
tudes embodied in words when
those attitudes were intact.

"You do an injustice to wom-
en‘s studies if you only deal with
20th century attitudes." the en-
ergetic feminist told her class.

“One student said she was
drowning. That there were so
many issues to deal with when
considering women ‘in literature,
political, social, and historical,”
Landy explained. “The
grows and grows the more you
deal with it.”

Dr. Rae Siporin. who has work-
ed with Landy and members of the

‘ Advisory Council on Women's Op-

portunities to establish woinen‘s
courses. explained -the value of
feminist studies. ‘

"Women's studies courses start-
ed two years ago on an experimen-
tal basis,” she explained. “It is
obvious that students are interest-
ed because the movement to in-

stitute women‘s studies courses is.

largely student oriented.“

Ms. Siporin, a member of the
Advising Center said that “wom-
en’s studies courses are a means
of locating the ways in which the
society has systematically dis-
criminated against women.”

"'At least developing a" conscious-
ness of what it. means to be dis-
criminated against,“ is a task Cin-
dy Sheehan pinned for herself as
an instructor for CAS 22: Wom-

The petitions condemn the_SA
officials for “. . . failing to faith-

fully execute their offices, for act- _

ing in violations of the Student As-
sociation , Constitution, and for’
conducting themselves in such .a
manner as to bring ill repute upon
the Student Association.”

Forbes said that he and the,”.15 A

active members of the group are
upset about the student govern-
ments  . . frightening lack of
integrity where the handling of

. students‘ money is concerned. 
He noted that the group was par- '

ticularly angered by the “uncon-

ment. the Commissioners‘ de-
mands for salaries, and the “sun-

_ Pittsburgh women agreed in a
_’j'-near unanimous vote‘ Thursday to
 approve the guidelines of the Na-
' .‘t_ional Women’s Political Caucus
.--“at an organizational meeting of
\ the Pennsylvania Women’s Politi-
*‘ cal Caucus.

_ V They also passed two proposed
 amendments to the guidelines.

- . The National Women’s Political
'_Caucus (NWPC) was organized
' , this summer in Washington, D.C.
.‘. ‘The aim of the caucus was to in-
= .-crease the number of women hold-
L’ ‘ ‘ing public offices. Approximately
-  324 women, representing a cross-
AV - section of the country and of po-
4- litical parties met July 10 and 11
 to‘ reach out to women across the

’ country to unite them against sex-

 and poverty.
Audrey Wells, who attended this
summer’s meeting, stated the
. reason for the organization of the
 - NWPC when she spoke briefly at
» _ "Thursday’s meeting. She said it
A ._was to fight against the “male-
7; dominated political arena in our
‘ j society that is off-limits to wom-
en.”

The NWPC has carried out its
plan, she said, by rallying "na-
tional and local support for the

_ * campaigns of women candidates-
 federal, state, and local—who de-
I clare themselves ready. to fight

, for the rights and needs of women,
_',and of all under-represented

' V groups.”
' ' .The NWPC guidelines include:
passage of the Equal Rights

g _ ‘Amendment to the U.S. Constitu-
 I T_- tion, prohibition of support of any
,';'.~; _candidate, male or female, who

-‘fism, racism ,’ institutional violence,

Political Caucus  

holds or advocates racist or sex-
ist views, and immediate U.S.
withdrawal from the war in Indo-
china and an end to physical vio-
lence as an acceptable way of re-
solving conflict.

The two amendments ask for
free comprehensive parents and
community child care centers to
be established and the adoption
in total of the Black Caucus Re-
port on Racism.

- Olga Madar, vice-president of
the United Auto Workers and a
member of the Policy Council of
NWPC, stirred the women pre-
sent at the meeting. She spoke of
action against racism. poverty,
unequal opportunity, ‘pollution.
lack of medical care, and war. She
stated, "You certainly can‘t cross
off half of our society and that's
the females." She argued that
women “were always a minority"
and "never did we push for the
right to be individuals."

A letter that will be sent to Gov-
ernor Shapp was read and approv-
ed at the meeting. In the letter,

the caucus asks the Governor to
immediately fill the office of Spe-
cial Assistantto the Governor on
Women’s Affairs and the five va-
cancies on the Pennsylvania State
Human Relations Commission
with women. They also criticize-
Shapp for establishing an all-male
task force to promote the appoint-

Wment of women to government'of-

fices.

 McGovern Reforms

Denis Den1oc”'atize Delegations

by SUZANNE MCDEVITT

Joel Swerdlow. regional organ-
izer for Senator George McGov-
ern's presidential campaign came
to Pitt Friday to talk about Mc-
Govern and recent reforms with-
in the Democratic Party.

“Since 1968 the Reforms Com-
mission, chaired by Senator Mc-

.Govern. has devised more open

system of delegate selection and
the reforms are being implement-
ed. Sixty-five per cent of the dele-
gates who will go to the conven-
tion will be freely elected.

"Anyone who can get 100 signa-

tures on a petition can get his .

name on the ballot in his district
as a delegate f'or a specific presi-
dential candidate.“ Swerdlow
said. "If his candidate carries his
district, he stands a good chance
of going to the convention."

“Also,',’ Swerdlow continued.
"the delegations must now be rep-

resentative of the people who
elect them. Ideally. if 75 percent
of the people in the district are
aged 18 to 30. then 75 per cent of
the delegates should be in that age
range ' I

The McGovern Commission has
made specific provisions for the
inclusion of blacks. youths. and
women as delegates.

The Commission has also for-
bidden a state delegation from
voting as a bloc... Consequently,
Swerdlow explained, a more open

- system should exist and more im-

portant decisions should be made
on the convention floor.

Pennsylvania has,not yet im-
plemented the reforms but is due
to soon.

McGovern is not out to mount
"Children's Crusade," as Senator
McCarthy did in 1968. "McGov-
ern will emerge as an organiza-
tion candidate," said Swerdlow,

Silent Majority Losing‘ Morale

"and that is a measure of the way
the party has changed.

McGovern is often labelled an
inevitable loser. Swerdlow blames
it on the media.

"The media has decided that
Muskie is the front-running candi-
date so they cover him like he is
the front-running candidate. and
therefore he is. If you look at what
networks run on Muskie the films
look like they were made by Mus-
kie's campaign staff.

“McGovern was at the United
Mine Workers picnic Labor Day
in Cleveland. He was walking
around and sometimes between
places there was no one around
him and sometimes he was sur-

rounded by a crowd. The networks
filmed it all but they showed the A

clips whenhe was walking be-
tween places alone. Therefore,‘
McGovern is a losing candidate."

Revel Deﬁnes U.S. Revolution

jority has lost a little more of its
morale,” .Revel, the author of
Without Marx or Jesus, said.
"Such things take place ata deep
level and are very important."

With both hands wrapped firmly
over the front corners of the podi-
um Revel announed, “We need to
develop a new concept of revolu-
tion. We tend to pay more atten-

tion to the’ process of a revolution ,

than to the outcome.”
He explained that the revolu-

. tions of the 19th century, although

violent, only resulted in new dic-

~ tatorships. Revel also criticized

contempory European revolution-
aries for trying to model their ef-
forts on those of the 1917 revolu-
tion in Russia.

“The Russian Revolution was-

carried out in a basically agrari-
an society. But you can’t take such
a model, transfer it to an ad-

‘total social phenomena and ex-

vanced technological society and
expect it to work,” Revel said
with a mild French accent. “It has

been a tendency of European rev- ‘ ‘

olutionaries to follow another
model. But there has never been a
true Marxist revolution.

“A revolution has to be some-
thing entirely new,” the social
analyst added. “That’s what’s uni-
que about America. The Ameri-
can New Left was creating a new
approach with new tactics like the
sit-in, teach-in, and marches.
They were not looking into th
past." '

Revel defined a revolution as a

plained, “There is not revolution
if there are not first, deep
changes in the goals of the so-
ciety.” -

Lozowski’s feature on A. R. Nern- .
berg (Pitt News, Oct. 4). I am
probably his latest victim. My
story, ‘however, has an extra
twist. Let me relate it to you.

b I signed a two-year lease for
.a single apartment at 322 N.
Craig St. in September of
1970. Everything went along

"fine until July 1, when Pitts-

burgh was drenched by a storm;
a check valve failed and the‘
sewer in the laundry room back-
ed up, flooding part of the first

1 floor of the building.

It took me about 15 hours to
clean up the mess in my apart-
ment and to repack my wet be-

. loiigings.

lWhat was done by the owner
and management to dry things
up? Well, the head of main-
tenance tried to pick up as much
of the water as he could with
a vacuum cleaner.

‘ Naturally I went to the rental
office right away to find out
what would be done about my
damages. I was assured that if
I made out a list of damaged
articles, date of purchase and
amounts, it would all be taken
care of. My total was $78.87,
plus the day of work I had miss-
ed to make the inventory.

For over three weeks then, I
lived out of boxes because I
could not replace anything un-
til the carpet was dry. I had-_ to

in - keep ,the air conditioner fan on
. all day to remove the odor, and

flay,

I had to keep the closet door
open to keep my clothes from
smelling like mildew.

During this fun time of hav-
ing my belongings in boxes on
my studio couches, on my cof-
fee table, and on my dinner
table, something else started

happening-—the carpet started to
mildew.

 

It wasn't my carpet, so I in-
formed Mr. Nernberg immedi-
ately. He seemed -concerned,
but unfortunately not concerned
enough to do anything.

I consulted an attorneyyto get
some action, but he told me that
my only course of action would
be to terminate my lease because
of the unhealthy condition.

Rather than just do' that, I
wrote to Mr. Nernberg, telling

Flick Switch a‘Sham’ /

. Dear Sir:

Sunday night I attended what was advertised as f'our Chaplin
flicks at the Student Union Ballroom. Arriving late. I paid my fifty

cents for the Pittsburgh Legal Defense Fund and found a seat just

in time to see the end of the second film.

House lights went on, and to the front strode a Vietnam Vet-
ran for Peace who informed the audience that only t’..ree of the four
Chaplin films had arrived, but that we would get to seeinstead, (no
doubt so that we would get our full share of light entertainment) a
film of great social importance on that. most delightful of comic

subjects, Vietnam War Atrocities.

'l‘he,audience, catatonic with shock. gazed in disbelief as lights
dimmed and the screen came alive with Vietnam Atrocity parti-
cipants and/or witnesses piously confessing their collective rapes. tor-

tures. burnings. et al.

My mind flashed on irony, then decided on sham.

I abandoned my seat and beat a path to the moneytakers who in-
formed me that I would still get to see one Chaplin film at the

conclusion of this laugh riot.

I then informed them that that was no deal for me. Then they.
deciding that I must be some sort of fascist reactionary warmonger.
begrudgingly returned my admission amid catcalls and liolier than
thou pontifications—“Sleep well," “Don't you know there's a War on?" b

on 1’ "
Whooooweee. Pretty scary.

Sincerely.
Kenneth Toth

him that if the carpet was not
taken up and cleaned, and a new
pad put down, I would termin-
ate my lease as of September 1.

Action} The carpet was taken
up, a new pad was put down,
and the mildewed carpet was
put right back down.

By this time, too, Mr. Nern-
berg‘s insurance company had

informed me that they could not ‘

pay any of my damages.

Next step! I terminated my
lease on September 1. Mr. Nern-
berg checked the apartment-for
damage with both my father and
fiance standing right there listen-
ing to him, and said that it was
in good shape, one of the best,
and that he was sorry to lose me
as a tenant. He added that a
check for my security deposit
($148i would be sent to me by
September 30.‘ *

On September 22, I received
a letter from the A. R. Building

Corporation, charging me with:

“Range needs cleaned” . . . $50.
“Bookcase dirty” .* . . . . . . . 10.
“Sublet shortage" . . . . . . 36.
“Rental Commission” . . . . . . 10.
“Advertising” . . . . . . . P. . 25.

Their total was $226. less my
security deposit of $148. I owed
them $78. You try adding up the
charges and see what you get
as a total. (Ed; N ote—$221.)

Also note that the total that
the corporation claims that I
owe is just 87 cents less than
my damage total.

4F. Pangborn

Film Club Defended

by STEVE SAVAGE and DAVID SAZ

We seek to exonerate the Franklin-Pangborn Film
Club from attacks and innuendo recently voiced in the
Pitt News. prompted by misunderstanding, personality-
antagonisms, vacillating bureaucrats, and base po-
litical maneuvering.

Franklin-Pangborn services the student community
in three unique fashions: it promotes a comprehensive
fine film program, it provides the opportunity for any
Pitt student to gain competence in the craft of film
(a relevant educational need that the University has
all but overlooked), and it is working on a newsreel
service to facilitate inter—student and student—com-
munity communication.

The projectionists who wrote in the Oct. 11 issue
surmise that Franklin-Pangborn income promotes a
superfluity of production funds (i.e. Woodstock net-
ting 25 hours of film). A few trifles like capital ex-
penditures, insurance, and lab fees were unconsidered,
however. ~

We would welcome any investigation. . .our books
will reveal that we have neither been corrupt nor ex-
travagant. Most of last year’s profits went to capital
purchases while this‘ year a variety of short student
films and a major production for TV have been allo-
cated funds and equipment. ‘

_The major production concerns student housing
and community problems. In the past year. the Pitt
News has published numerous articles on such prob-
lems, but neither they nor WPGH nor any other stu-
dent organization can transport the student’s perspec-
tives to the outside communit . -

As co-producers, we intend to air these problems
in the format of a thirty-minute television documen-
tary that will indeed reach the community. This docu— ’
mentary will be of the highest professional standards,
and we have already been solicited for national airing.

In addition, Pittsburgh’s' Off-Campus Oakland will
provide a unique opportunity. Any student interested
can participate in the production, research the issues,
assume as much responsibility and learn as much about .
film production as he or she may wish.

Let’s do it tohim! ;

Armchair QB’s, One
Real ()neChastized

Editor:
This. letter is addressed to Dave Havern. the
football team. as well as the entire student body.

It seems as though Pitt now has in the neigh-
borhood of 20.000 head coaches, or that is the im-
plication one receives after reading page 12 of
today‘s Pitt News. It seems as though several of
the players are disgruntled with the behavior or
bhe fans, or the apparent. lack of behavior of the
ans.

Whether the fans were ‘~‘so terrible” (John
Moss, Pitt News, P. 12) or not, is hard to say,
maybea review of the circumstances is needed.

Last" Saturday. after two consecutive disap-
pointing losses, including one to WVU. Pitt came
onto the field to play Navy. As they entered. the
student body gave its roar of approval. ready for
the expected’ onslought of the Middies from An-
napolis.

Note that the Pitt student body section was
the only section completely filled. It had been

this way since noon. an hour and a half before
gametime. ‘

It was obvious to see as well as hear that the
students were behind the football team.. Unfor-
tunately. as John Moss commented for the team.
“No one was really up." so as the ball players"
come out for the second half. they‘re surprised
to hear the fans objecting to their mode of first
half play. Note that Penn State fans called
for their quarterbacks head when the team was.
down only one point in the middle of the third
quarter against Air Force on October 12.

‘The boos quickly changed to cheers when
Pitt scored a hard eight points. As Rich Porter-
field, a Navy Captain out with a fractured leg,
said, f‘When Pitt scored" those first eight points,
they gained two things they
half-confidence in
from the fans.”

themselves and confidence

lacked in the first

we gotta be good.

Even when Pitt was down ' by 25 points. they
remained and did not leave the game to watch the
opening match of the World Series.

The fans were staying to support their team.

Suppose the team had emerged from half-time
to find nobody in the stands?'It is highly impos-
sible that they would have scored, let alone come-
back to win.

It IS interesting to note that Havern, griped by the
conduct of the fans" repeatedly asking the fans to
quiet their cheers during the offensive’s three
drives in the second half.

To_tl_ie team—I don’t entirely agree with your fan
negativism, but I’ll continue to back you despite;
win or loss.

Now to the fans—1et‘s get with the program!
How is it that only a few individuals cheer unless
we appear to come close to scoring?

There are times when I’m embarrassed to sit in
the lifeless student section. Fans never seem to

’ support the defense. The cheerleaders are almost

never supported, although many of their cheers are
not inspiring.

It is a fact that high schools make more noise.
But maybe it is un-in to cheer at the game. If
you aren’t going to cheer, don’t bother coming
because you aren’t,_worth a damn.

If you aren’t proud of Pitt, ‘get the hell out.
Why is it that the freaks make more noise than
the frats or at least an equal amount and are con-
sidered by some to be misrepresentatives of the
school‘? .

What is done. is done. Three extremely
rough games remain in the future. But if the play-
ers decide they're playing for Pitt and the stu-
dents get totally up for the games. I look for the
Pitt _team (and students) to surprise everybody
except ourselves. Let's show them that Pitt is
No. 1 and why it is. With 20.000 head coaches.

A simple harmonica tune

strained sweetly through. the rich

atmosphere of Carnegie Music
Hall as the bearded player clos-
ed his eyes and rocked to his
melodies, then picked up his gui-
tar to round out the tune.

The harmonica just rolled
around his lips without the as-
sistance of a metal holder as the
last of the late-comers slid ner-
vously into their seats.

"I corrupt very subtly, if at
all," mused stocky folksinger
Theodore Bikel. "For my sins I
sing folk songs. You know, folk-
singers aren’t different from
people, only more so.

Bikel is different from most
people. Not only is he an author,
lecturer, and brilliant actor, but
he is fluent in seven languages,
and can sing in 21.

His guitar is more than a
musical instrument, it is a tool
for making friends. He learns
the tongues of as many people
as possible because he believes
that the combination of language
and music can form a strong
bond between people, a form of

communication that could have
the world.

"Once you do that." he com-
ments “you stop shouting .
or stop shooting each other. You
may laugh. but I have yet to
find anyone with a better
way."

Bike1's programs are strongly
laced with folk and Jewish hu-

mor. all intertwined with warm.
Bikel wit.

“If foreigners were worth
anything,” he quips as he tunes
his guitar, “they would speak
English.”

And to prove that he was
worth something (and could also
speak English) his first vocal
number was Phil Och's Power
and Glory, a rousing modern
American folk tune. .

Bikel was most at home with
Yiddish and Hebrew numbers,

' and songs- dealing with the Jew-

ish people. Several songs ..were
expressly dedicated to the plight
of Soviet Jews, one of which was
an “underground anthem" sung
a Capella, and roughly translated
meant, “I don't believe anyone
but God alone.” -

On the lighter side, he sang

some gayerbawdier songs, some
of which included love songs.
(“On chile con carne you sing
a different (love) song than on
gefilte fish. I ”)

Following the traditions of
folk music. his songs were either
simple anecdotes or moral les-
sons. But most important to
this tradition. he built a casual
atmosphere and developed a
strong rapport with the audience.
making the evening much like
an informal get-together in
someone's home.

He didn't have to beg people
to sing along with Last Night
I Had The Strangest Dream or
to clap to his stirring rhythms.
It all happened swiftly and
naturally.

Nobody had to fight ampli-
fiers or “heavy” sounds. The
audience . just sat back and
laughed, relaxed, and listened to
a myriad of folk tunes includ-

ing the Scottish drinking song

“Nancy Whiskey”, the Russian
song popularized by Lennon-
McCartney “Those Were The
Days” the beautiful French-
Flemish tunes of Jacques
Brel, and the humorous and
classic strength of Woody

Guthrie.

Bikel's performance relied
heavily on looks. nods. and an
occasional shrug of his broad
shoulders. He proved that lang-
uage need not be a barrier to

communication between differ-
ent cultures. So even if you

couldn't speak the language he
was singing in. you were never
.left in doubt as to every impli-
cation.

"Maybe I was expecting too

Edge Pi Lam, 3-2;

Meet Delta lSigHF0r Title  

. Phi Gamma Delta (Fiji) advanced in the fraternity division of the
intramural softball playoffs by defeating Pi Lamba Phi, 3-2, in extra
innings on the Pitt Stadium Astroturf yesterday. V

The game was marked by erratic fielding by both teams as Pi
Lambda Phi took advantage of two Fiji errors in the bottom of the sec-

ond to score both of their runs.

The lead-off batter for the Pi Lams reached first base on the ihitial

Fiji miscue but was then forced at
second. Then. on an attempted
double play. the Pi Lam runner
was ruled safe at second and the
throw to first was wild. moving
the runners to second and third.

The first Pi Lam run was scored
on a putout at first base while the
second was singled in by Barry
Judd. ‘

The Fijis struck back in the top
of the fourth when Rocky Pile lead
off with a single and then reach-
ed second when the throw from
Paul Kalinsky‘s ground ball was
off the mark. After two consecu-
tive fly outs. Pete Antonopolis
rapped a single to drive in Pile.

throw to the plate. and Kalinsky

fense’s worst enemy? , , ‘

After Saturday night’s game _at Tulane i,t’s questionable
whether the entire Pitt squad can put it togethereither offen-
sively or defensively. V ’

' Every team is plagued with weaknesses, but when spirit and‘

determination become a primary deterent then one starts ‘to’

wonder whatthe squad is doing on the field in the first place. If a
player goes out onto the field and gives it his best, then no one
can complain. But if a total effort is too much to ask, then the
gridiron is the wrong place for that particular ballplayer to be.

Some people call them mistakes, others call them errors.
Coach Carl DePasqua calls them turnovers, but they all point to
the same thing. The Panthers are not sharp.’ They haven’t been
sharp since the UCLA game over a month ago. It’s about time
the squad starts learning from .its mistakes.

The evident fact is that the Panthers fumbled the ball seven
times on Saturday and were intercepted twice. The more subtle
evidence of, the team’s flatness are things like blown assign-

ments, players running on and off the
field just before a play begins, missed
tackles, and slow coverage. These mis-
cues detract tremendously from the
overall performance of a team and Pitt
had-all the ingredients in New Orleans.

Certainly the defensive line‘ show-
ed their colors, holding the Greenies
to 91 yards on the ground, but that did-
n’t help the offense produce some
points of their own. Usually this sea-
son the attacking corps has been pro-
ductive, leavingithe defense to play the
equalizer. Saturday the roles were reversed.

New Orleans is known as the “City of Enchantment," but
Carl DePasqua’s little leprechaun Dave Havern forgot to bring
along his bag of tricks. In fact the Green Wave appeared to have
cornered the market on sleight of hand magic, coming up with
the football almost every time Pitt had possession. 3

Every time things started to look up for the Pitt contingent,
a costly. miscue would squash the drive: Joel Klimek takes a
pass over the middle for 13 yards and then fumbles the ball. The
Cats move the ball deep into Tulane territory then run out of
downs. Dan Rullo recovers a fumble at the Tulane 15 only to
have the ball coughed up 1_0 seconds later. Eric Knisley gets off
a line drive punt which Joe Bullard then returns 51 yards for a
touchdown. And amazingly enough, the list goes on and on.

The veterans and the sophomores combined to give the de-
fense a solid pursuit. They kept both Mike Walker and Rusty
Lachaussee running for their lives most of the evening. Only

- desperation passes, that “somehow” found their targets kept

the two Tulane sustained drives alive.

Jack Dykes, Howie Broadhead and Ralph Cindrich provided
the experience, while relatively untested newcomers like Art
/Simon, John Robb, and Dan Rullo turned in stellar perfor-
mances. But when you’re fighting for your life, first and ten in-
side your own 20, things rarely seem promising. It certainly did-
n’t make the complexion any rosier for the Panthers on Saturday.

But then again, 60 minutes of solid football has always been

Harriers Romp To 3 0 ~ i Pa,lther5

2nd Dual

Meet W in

Against Moiintaineers

V by VINCE DI NARDO

The Pitt cross country team is i
a veryclosely knitsquadand doesn't’

mind showing it in the midst of
competition. For the second meet
in a row, there was more than one
Pitt winner. if

Dave Szabat and Mike Schurko
crossed the finish line with their
hands united to pace the harriers
to a 25-32 win'over a gutty West
Virginia corps.

The Szabat/Schurko combina-
tion almost eclipsed the Pitt cross
country record, missing it by only
three seconds. Their time, 31:37,
was three minutes quicker than
the one posted two weeks ago

against Cleveland State.

Jim Banner, the harriers; coach,
felt that “everybody seemed to be
inspired” for the‘ confrontation.
The inspiration wasn’t dampened
any by the constant Saturday
morning drizzle and the Banner-
men went on to take six of the top
ten finishes. -

West Virginia’s power quickly
followed Szabat and Schurko. Bill
Hunnigton, Doug Carter‘, and
Morgan Mosser took third, fourth,
and fifth places to make the scor-
ing close.

MIKE SCHURKO
Winning Form

Schurko (Mike’s brother) took the
pivotal sixth and seventh places
to insure the win.

Because of leg injuries to John
Black and Mike Collins, the har-
riers were not at full strength.
Collins started the race but with-
drew after the first two miles.
Both Collins and Black were
among the five first place finish-
ers against Cleveland State.

The win was the second for the
talented Pitt team andiwas the
firstdefeat suffered by the Moun-
taineers.

The harriers will have another
two week layoff before they travel
to Buffalo, N. Y.. for the Canaci-
us Invitational, which is due to oc-
cur Oct. 30.“ The meet was orig-
inally scheduled for the 23rd of
October.

remaining in the contest. By then

' the game was iced for Tulane.

Dave Haven. started for the
Panthers at quarterback but
couldn’t get the offense rolling.
The team’s first drive sputtered
at the Tulane 32 where Eric Knis-
ley attempted -a 47-yard field goal
which fell short. The Panthers
didn’t threaten again until mid-
way through the third quarter.

Tulane’s 13-0 lead at halftime
fit right into the pattern that
Pitt-‘s opponents have formed this
season. The Panthers‘ reputation

for producing a second-half come— '

back was foremost on the minds
of the Greenies. -

“All week we talked about
Pittsburgh's ability to come
back," commented Greenie Coach
Bennie Ellender after the game.

4 "The boys were talking about it at

halftime.”

But the Cats never did get their
machine rolling. They spotted the

history to amass over 1,000 yards
in receptions. He pushed his total
to 1,045 yards.

In what Ellender called "our
best defensive game of the sea-
son." the Tulane defense did the
job. They gave ground to the Pan-
thers all evening, but came up
