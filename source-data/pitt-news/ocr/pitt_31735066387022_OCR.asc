Fraternities, sororities raise
$102,000 for Greek Week

By Christine Hanna
Managing Editor

Pitt’s fraternities and sororities raised
$102,000 for Pennsylvania’s Special
Olympics during this year’s Greek Week.

According to Business Manager Kelly
Reddy, they awarded Special Olympics
with the check at Friday night’s formal at
the Westin William Penn.

Reddy said the money raised came
from events including canning, the
Dance Marathon, the 5K Run, a benefit
concert at Metropol, Greek God and
Goddess sponsors, ticket sales and dona-
tions from Greek Week sponsors.

According to Brian Rifkin, last year’s
Greek Week business manager, approxi-
mately $94,600 was raised in 1993.

Rifkin said more money was raised this

involved and took a more active role in
participating. ,

Overall Greek Week co-Chair Cassi
Berarduccisaid there was a constant
worry of not reaching the original goal of
$100,000.

“At one point, I stated that we wouldn’t

get more than $50,000,” Berarducci said.
, She said with the weather that has hit
Pittsburgh, the negativity coming from
the Greeks in general about canning and
that only six or seven fraternities turned
in money caused many concerns for her
and the executive board.

Berarducci said if every fraternity
would have turned in money, Greek

at least taken the ﬂack off of the other

Joycelyn Elders
comes to Pitt via
satellite to stop
youths from using
tobacco products

By Rebecca Baker
Staff Writer

As part of a nationwide meeting to stop chil-
dren from smoking cigarettes and using chew-
ing tobacco, Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders
came to Pitt via satellite Thursday afternoon.

In her two-hour program, “Youth and Elders,”
national officers from the Student Coalition
Against Tobacco sat in with Elders to admonish
tobacco advertising for being geared toward
young people.

“We want to stop young people from starting
to smoke, reduce the number of teenagers who
do smoke and reduce the number of places to
smoke,” said one SCAT officer.

SCAT founder David Dubner said that the
members of the group act as positive role mod-
els for peers and spread messages that it's not
cool and that advertisers are trying to seduce us.

“Kids [should know] they’re the target for
tobacco advertisers,” said SCAT Vice President
Erin Berry.

“But SCAT will advertise the truth,” Dubner
added. “We want to create an epidemic of stu-
dent activism, rather than disease.”

Every few minutes, “factlets” would flash on
the screen with statistics about the dangers of
young people smoking, such as “nearly all first
use occurs before high school graduation” and
“$4 billion a‘ year is spent on tobacco advertise-
ments.”

Elders talked about the five “S’s” inﬂuencing
minors to smoke, which included being slim,
sexy and sophisticated.

“Smoking can prevent full growth of young
people's lungs, and they also get an early hard-
ening of the arteries,” Elders said, “and adver-

children at Hand-in-Hand

ByJon Hayes
Staff Writer

Pitt students made Saturday afternoon
a time for colorful streamers, joyous
cheerleaders, slaphappy sing—alongs,
goofy clowns and wild mascots.

The 16th annual Hand-in-Hand festi-
val, held on the first and second floors
of Forbes Quad, united local disadvan-
taged children with hundreds of Pitt stu-
dents. By the end of the day, few panic-
ipants could deny the event’s success. 0

“The kids are wonderful, and they are
having a great time. It’s really reward-
ing,” said Stephanie Hepner, sporting a
tie made out of a blue streamer.
Operating one of the 35 booths at the
festival, Hepnersaid her Phi Sigma Pi
booth was busy decorating wheelchairs-

with balloons, ribbons and bows.

Several clowns, 225 children and 400
students walked from booth to booth
with prominent Pittsburgh personalities
such as the Pitt Panther, a whistling
Pirate Parrot, the Pittsburgh Steeler and
T—Carnegie Rex. Children smiled upon
receiving a toy from each station.

One child, Jeff Holtman, wore a
Hand-in-Hand T-shirt picturing this
year’s theme, “Circle of Friends,” with a
Chicago Bulls hat. Carrying a green bal-
loon, he displayed his bag full of
dinosaur eggs, a toy whale and dolphin,

a fire fighters hat and several plastic

writing slates.

student volunteer, said, “I tiy to figure

By Matt Groff
Asst. News Editor

The Black Action Society had a solid
turnout at Friday’s elections to deter-
mine their new overall chair, accord-
ing to Election Committee co-Chair
Lorraine Faulcon.

“The [chair] position is a big respon-
sibility,” Tasha Johnson said. Johnson,
who serves as chair of the Black
Action Student Inter-Collegiate
Struggle committee, said the chairhas

a major effect on the direction of the
BAS. ,

Candidates for the office are Rinaldo
Washington and Michael Barge, who
are both holding positions this year in
BAS.

The election winner will succeed
current Chair Keith Davis, who will
release the election results later in the
week, according to Faulcon. The elec-
tion, held at tables in the Towers,
William Pitt Union and Lothrop Hall,
was open to all BAS members.

Election co-Chair Janice John-Lewis
said the election has raised awareness
about the BAS issues.

“The election is very important
because we hear what the candidates
have to say [on campus issuesl,” John-
Lewis said. “The BAS needs to grow
and become stronger as an organiza-
tion. Hopefully the new chair will be
able to get more people_ interested in
and supporting the BAS.”

national collegiate liberal arts
honorary, inducted 57 mem-
bers Tuesday night in the
School of Law’s- Moot Court
Room.

“Election to this society,
founded in 1776, is consid-
ered to be the greatest honor
that can be awarded to
students majoring in the
arts and sciences,” said
Society President Jeremy
Sabloff, professor of anthro-
pology and Phi Beta Kappa

from the University of
Pennsylvania.
The requirements are

tough and far exceed general
graduation requirements.

“It’s a recognition of stu-
dents’ scholarly achieve-
ment,” said Sabloff.

Students must have a
cumulative grade point aver-
age of at least 5.5, have
strong cultural awareness,
high scholarly achievement
and good character.
They must also complete an
extensive liberal arts curricu-
lum.

“It is for someone who has
embraced the liberal arts cur-
riculum,” Sabloff said.
According to Sabloff, Phi
Beta Kappa is looking for
students who excel in a well-
rounded way.

Professor Mark Perlman and
Professor Merrilee Salmon,

Both old and new winners of

Students talked, exchanging
stories and anecdotes. Those
who previously studied abroad
answered questions while
the future ones discussed their
plans for upcoming trips."

“Some undergrads have never
been abroad,” said Eileen Kiley,
scholarship advisor.

“It is a whole new experi-

“It’s a benefit for the universi-

students that have international
experience,” she said.

Some of the other benefits of
the experience that Kiley
describes are the exposure to
new cultures, meeting new peo-
ple, building self-confidence
and making contacts in the stu-
dent’s fields of study.

“There was a gentleman in
Russia who met contemporary
‘authors there. It helps to
enhance one’s professional

Smoking

Continued from page 1
tisements have the message
that smoking is beneficial
and appealing!” ,

Elders said she wants to
take an esteem-boosting
approach to prevent kids
from smoking, since her
study found that most minors
using tobacco have low
grades and low self-esteem.

Other panelists supported
a stronger anti—smoking cam-
paign in the United States,
especially in elementary and
junior high schools.

“Most Americans, even
smokers, favor policies that
limit access [of tobacco prod-
ucts] to young people,” said
panelist Dr. Martha Mediano.

“It defeats the point if in
one part of the [schooll
building you teach tobacco
prevention and in another
part there are adults smok-
ing,” said school director
Tom Donnely.

Elders said schools can
take steps to prevent their
students from smoking by
providing programs from
kindergarten to graduation,
training teachers, involving
parents and other family
members and instructing
kids about the immediate
results of smoking, such as
stained fingers and bad
breath, rather than the dis-
tant consequences of lung
cancer and emphysema.

“Three thousand children

are recruited every day,” said
Mediano. “So [people need
to] support state laws to
enforce the ban of cigarettes
to minors. Schools can’t do it
alone.” '

Throughout the program,
viewers worldwide called in
to give Elders their support
for her anti-tobacco cam-
paign. Viewers called from as
far away as the University of
Alaska and Melbourne,
Australia.

Elders presented two anti-
smoking videos geared
toward young people. One

had two young boys starting .

to smoke after seeing adver-
tisements on billboards and
in store windows and after
seeing their father and sister
doing the same thing.
Another featured the
progress of anti—smoking
campaigns in inner-city
schools.

Out of the two dozen peo-
ple who watched Elders and
the panelists speak were rep-
resentatives from the
American Heart Association,
the American Cancer Society,
the Pennsylvania PTA, the
Allegheny County Health
Department and Pitt’s School
of Health. A

Other attendees said they
have been active in prevent-
ing. minors from buying
tobacco products and in ban-
ning smoking from public
places.

Included in the ceremony
last night was the presenta-

Phi Beta Kappa prize. It
goes to a junior who has the

whose curriculum would

“People are looking at the
issues and picking the person
who they feel will best repre-
sent their interests,” Johnson
said

Faulcon also spoke on the
benefit of competition for BAS
chair. ’

“It’s better to have a choice,”
she said. Last year there was
only one candidate for the
office, who serves as head of
one of the eight governance
groups.at Pitt.

According to BAS officials, the
chair oversees all BAS activities
and plays an important role in
choosing the leaders of various
committees. Acting BAS com-
mittees currently include
BASICS, programming, political
action and community outreach.

The amendments were dis-
cussed last week, and students
are now going over them in the
graduate student organizations
within each school, Parks said.
If enough people from the vari-
ous schools are comfortable
with the language of the
amendments, they may be
voted on at the GPSA meeting
Thursday.

Another amendment dis-
cussed would change the date
that representatives for the
GPSA would be selected from

some continuity between mem-
bers of the group from year to

Harassment is still a serious issue

A recent poll conducted by Louis Harris and Associates
reveals that not only is sexual harassment a widespread
problem, but that it is often ignored. The Reuters news
agency cites the Harris poll as saying that 18 percent of
all U.S. workers have been harassed. I

Younger workers are more likely to report incidents
and to take action to see that the problem is dealt with.
With up to one-third of American working women hav-
ing been harassed, and 7 percent of the men (59 percent
of which say they were sexually harassed by females),
sexual harassment is a serious problem.

Harassment can come from anyone in the workplace.
Although most victims of harassment say that they are
harassed by supervisors or senior workers, a significant

. number (25 percent) say they have been inappropriately
treated by equals or junior workers.

While these incidents are a serious problem in the
working world, in the restricted atmosphere of a college
campus, they can become even more troublesome.

Imagine a student who faces problems with a profes-
sor, teaching assistant or other staff member who the
student sees as having some power over him/her. This
student is more likely to feel a pressure to give in to
unwelcome requests or to endure unfair treatment.
There are documented cases of students who have been
threatened by teaching staff over grades, letters of rec-
ommendation and similar situations.As of now, Pitt has
no detailed, well—publicized policy for dealing with sex-
ual harassment. Thus the rights of the accused as well as
thevictims are being jeopardized.Pitt needs to take a
closer look at its policies concerning sexual harassment.
A policy needs to be developed by a committee involv-

 ing members of all areas" of the university. This policy
should provide for an outside committee to investigate
claims of sexual harassment and deal with cases where
an accusation of sexual harassment is borne out by the
evidence. This should not be only a “women’s issue,”
but a university issue.

This set policy needs to define procedures for investi-
gating sexual harassment cases and to define the pun-
ishments which actual offenders must face. What consti-
tutes sexual harassment and just punishment must be
clearly defined so that there are no questions about the
results of the case when an actual case of harassment is
found.Once these are in place, students, faculty and staff
must be aware of the proper method of filing a com-
plaint, where it should be filed and how soon they
should expect results. They must also know what
defines harassment, so that they do not feel they should
accept unfair treatment based on gender.

With such alarming statistics, it is unacceptable that the
university, one of the largest employers in Pittsburgh, is
not well prepared to deal with the issue.

Chalk one up to irresponsibility

Wednesday was an unusually beautiful day in
Pittsburgh, as a warm, gentle breeze kissed the
faces of students and licked at the bare legs of
those who donned shorts and skirts. But the
bright sun shone all too well on the sidewalklin
front of Hillman Library, illuminating the obnox-
ious graffiti of gay—rights activists that read, “Make
it clear. Hug a queer.”

Unfortunately, such sights are not uncommon
here at Pitt. The Soldiers and Sailors Memorial is
continually renovationed by students who appar-

ently have nothing better to do with their time 

than dream up catchy slogans with which to
color the buildings of Oakland. What’s more,
almost all of this graffiti (aside from an occasional
“Stop Rape” sign, compliments of university femi-
nists) contain a pro—gay message, which may lead

* pro—gay/anti-Catholic

ers consider graffiti to be a responsible, effective

form of communication. The University of.

Pittsburgh recently decided to extend health care
and other benefits to live-in gay lovers of univer-
sity employees. At Carnegie Mellon, senior politi-
cal science student Patrick Mooney was charged
with harassment for defending his position on a
poster last week.
Apparently, officials from both universities have
been reading the pro-gay graffiti lacing the streets
of Oakland and have made policy decisions
accordingly. Perhaps CMU officials, in particular,
should read the First Amendment to the
Constitution of the United States. In it, they will
find that every citizen has the right to free speech.
There is no clause excluding college students.
Nowhere does the Constitution add,  unless ‘a

citizen doth speak something

graffiti that fascinate gay activists?”

nasty about homosexuals, in
which case charges of harassment
shall be duly filed.” If it is neces-
sary, perhaps I could arrange to
have the First Amendment scrib-
bled in pink and blue chalk on

And that’s even better than getting
to hang your finger painting from kindergarten
on the refrigerator with a rainbow magnet when
you get home. But do they really think that silly
slogans. scrawled on the side of the cathedral or
pink triangles drawn on the sidewalk that every-
body can step on gives credence to their cause?
Aren’t they even a bit concerned that this juvenile
delinquency serves to undermine their efforts to

be treated equally as responsible adults? If there

is anything or anyone that portrays gay-activists
as mere social annoyances, it is actions of this
sort. What’s wrong with_newspaper and maga-
zine articles as methods of conveying their beliefs
to the masses? Perhaps they are after nothing
more than attention, and if that is the case they’ve
got plenty of it. It’s the same sort of attention that
confused teenagers get from their parents when
they slam the family car through the back of the
garage at four in the morning, spilling beer all
over their “MEGADETH” T-shiit as a joint slowly
burns away at the vinyl dash.

But perhaps I am wrong about this. Maybe oth-

the side of the cathedral that faces
CMU. As for those of us at Pitt, it appears that
gay-activists have discovered an effective form of
modern communication, so let’s jump on the
bandwagon. Not only is it a highly visible way in
which to express yourself, but it saves trees as
well. Leave messages for your roommate on the
wall or door of your dorm. “Lisa called. Call her
back before six. And pick up some more blue
chalk if you can. We’re out.” When a professor
asks you to hand in a paper about the Russian
economy, simply explain to him or her that it-is
neatly printed on the fiont of the Chevron
Science Center. Be sure to apologize for having
to change colors halfway through. Hell, at least
give the idea a try. If you get arrested, or your
professors aren’t impressed or scowl at you

irepugnantly, simply switch back to the boring old

paper-and-pen approach. At least you will have
learned something that gay-activists apparently
haven’t: The penis mightier than the sidewalk.

Lady Panthers take third in N WIT

Senior class exits Pitt with two wins in first—ever post—season tournament for the four stars

By Ryan Buncher

Asst. Sports Editor

The Pitt and Tulan
women’s basketbal
teams battled back an
forth late in their"'third
place game at the
National Women’
Invitational Tournamen
Saturday in Amarillo
Texas.

The Lady Panthers (21
10) led the Green Wave
(17-12) 63-61 with jus
over two minutes left "
when Pitt senior forward
Jonna Huemrich called
for the ball and scored.

“Jonna hit a real big
bucket to put us up
four,” Pitt head coach
Kirk Biuce said.

“They called timeout, 7'
and she came over to the
bench. I said, ‘You really ./
wanted the ball, didn’t V"
you?’

“She looked me in the
eye and said, ‘Yeah.’ I
told her that’s why she’s ?
a great player. The great ‘
players want it. That was 7
one of the big keys in
the game, in addition to
Erin Maloy lighting it up ‘
from outside.” ‘ I

I-Iuemrich scored 11 of 
Pitt's last 19 points as Pitt
held on for a 71-66 victo-
ry. Huemrich’s 17-point
total for the game gave
her double ﬁgures in the
final 58 games of he
career.

Maloy, who came back to
have a solid season despite a
preseason knee injury, led Pitt
with 19 points, most of them on
five three-pointers.

“She just shot the ball real
well. It seemed to me all of her
shots were big ones. Erin didn’t
have anything to prove to any-
body,” Bruce said. “Here she is
in her last ball game, and she

has one of the best games of her
career.” I
Seniors Huemrich, Maloy, Jill
Colabrese and Carolyn Miller
combined for 51 points in their
last game as Lady Panthers.

Jenine Joyce, who came
in with the other four but
has a year left due to a
redshin, scored 10 points
and grabbed 10
rebounds.

“We have a big group
of girls who have been
together a long time,”
Bruce said. “They were
saying [after the game]
how much they will miss
their teammates and
coaches. That’s kind of
nice to hear as a coach.

“They are real special
to me personally. They
are among the main rea-
sons why we had the
success we had this year.
I think the player-coach
relationship I’ve had with
these four players is one
I’ll never forget.”

Both teams were play-
ing their third game in
three days, which
seemed to give the deep
Lady Panthers an edge
over a Tulane squad that
only suited up seven
players.

“It wore them down
late in the game,” Bruce
said.

“It’s a mental thing.
You are playing a team
with only seven players
—— sometimes a little
complacency sets in. We
played hard but did not
do all of the right things.

Pitt Baseball brooms Boston College in weekend series

By Brady Slater
Staﬂ‘ Writer

Pitt head baseball coach Mark
Jackson had his team hold a
players-only practice on Friday,
a day after the Panthers had to
come from behind to tie NAIA
Geneva 9-9 in a game called
due to darkness.

“We just want the players to
realize that they’re responsible
for their approach to the game,”
Jackson said.

“The coaches are there to pro-
vide direction and leadership,
but ultimately it’s the players’
responsibility. It’s their
team.”

The Pitt players responded to
Jackson’s lesson by opening
their Big East season with a
three—game sweep of Boston
College at Trees Field this past
weekend.

The Panthers (12—4—1) won
the opener of Saturday’s dou-
bleheader by a score of 12-11
and followed that with a 10-1
victory.

On Sunday, the high—powered
Pitt offense didn’t let up, beat-
ing BC 12-3.

“That’s the best effort we’ve
had,” Jackson said.

“We were able to sweep
Seton Hall last year in three
games and take two of three
from St. John’s here, but this
was a better effort as far as
intensity.”

The series didn‘t start as well
as it ended for Pitt. With the
Panthers up 5-2 after four
innings in the first game, the BC
offense erupted for eight runs in
the fifth with four of them coin-
ing on right fielder Pete
Carmichael’s grand slam. BC
chased starter Jamie Goettler
and reliever Matt Skokowski in
the inning.

But Pitt answered in the bot-
tom of the fifth when left fielder
Kurt Allen’s three-run homer cut
the BC lead to 10-8. Pitt went
ahead with three runs in the
bottom of the sixth, two of the
runs scoring on

Genaro Severino and cast of fellow seniors say good-bye to Pitt with best performance of 1994 season

By Ed Ziegenfuss
Staﬂ Writer

The Pitt men’s gymnastics
team put together their best per-
formance of the season to finish
second in the National
Independent Championships
held this weekend at Trees Hall.

“It was a good way to say
goodbye,” senior Genaro
Severino said.

Every member of the team
performed well and when
crunch time came around the
team answered the call. Pitt
scored 270.2 points which was a
season high for them. The
University of Illinois at Chicago

was in a class by itself, taking 4

first with a score of 278.45.

“It’s been a long time com-
ing,” UIC‘coach “CJ” Johnson
said.

“I didn’t take it for granted. I
knew Pittsburgh was coming up
and William and Mary was very
good. This was a stepping-stone
to NCAA regionals for us.”

The Panthers did finish ahead
of many teams that had beaten
them the previous week at
ECACS. In third was William and
Mary (269.35), James Madison
University (268.65) took fourth,
Western Michigan University

(266.35) finished fifth, Kent
State (264.25) placed sixth and
Radford University (259.45)
brought up the rear.

“I am absolutely positively
elated,” Pitt head coach Frank
D’Amico said. “It’s been one
long year. We still have guys
who can’t do dismounts, and
this team went out and scored
270.” -

The best event for the
Panthers was the high bar. The
team scored 458, led by scores
of 9.4 from both Severino and
Chris Sweeten._ Brian Narvaez
(9.0), Scott Carslaw (9.2), Jason
Lannie (8.8) and Mike Maurer
(8.8) completed an inspired per-
formance by the blue and gold.

“We pulled through when we
needed to. It was a good way to
finish the season,” Carslaw said.

Pitt also racked up a team
total of 45.250 on rings. Keith
Youndt led the way by scoring a
9.45. Severino (9.4), Narvaez
(9.05), .Mark Saleem (8.80) and
Lannie (8.55) Completed the
scores on this apparatus.

“It was pretty emotional,” ring
specialist Saleem said after he
and Severino competed in their
last home meet at Pitt.

Staff‘ Writer said. “He made a couple of mistakes out there, single. The rest of the weekend was

The stereotypical banjo- hitting second base-
man, who is usually buried in the bottom of
the batting order doesn’t hold true for Pitt’s
Scott Etsell.

Etsell, reminiscent of a Ryne Sandberg—type
of player — a power—hitting second baseman
who the team relies on to drive in runs, didn’t
let his team down last weekend.

As the Pitt baseball team swept Boston
College last weekend, Etsell put up huge num-
bers:

He went six-for—13 (.429) with three dou-
bles, a home run and eight RBI, upping his
team—leading RBI total to 27 and three homers.

In the first game of the two—day tripleheader,
Etsell shined as he went three-for-ﬁve with an
RBI and three runs scored. And when Pitt
staged a late comeback in the bottom of the
sixth inning to score three runs, guess who
was in the thick of things — Etsell. He singled,
advancing his double—play partner Danny
Gonzalez to third. He then stole second and
‘eventually scored the go-ahead run.

The usually sure—handed fielder started off
the second game in a rough way by commit-
ting two errors. But Etsell showed his
resilience by making the rest of his plays, and
started off a beautiful double play to end the
fourth inning.

“I basically tried to tell him what I know,”
Pitt’s student assistant Brad Reese said. Reese,
a four—year starter at second base, passed his
torch of excellence to junior Etsell to continue
the legacy. “He is a lot smoother out there
turning the double play. Anyone who has
been around him knows he has improved a
lot.”

Most players take their fielding woes to the
plate with them, but not Etsell. He did. more
than forget about his errors, he produced 40
percent of Pitt’s 10 runs on two hits. Both of

his hits were two-run doubles that cleared the ‘"

bases.
“He bounced back and didn’t let his fielding

but that happens to everybody.”

“That would have sucked to make two

errors in the first inning,” Gonzalez said jok-
ingly. “But Scottie is one of those guys who
doesn’t let that kind of stuff bother him too
much.”
‘ Etsell passed his gut check and proceeded to
be a Golden Eagle killer once again in the final
game. Going into a 3-3 tie in the bottom of the
fifth inning, Pitt exploded for nine runs. After
Gonzalez doubled in two runs, Etsell dealt the
final blow to Boston College’s psyche. He
crushed a three—run bomb over the 380 feet
marker in left-center field. That was all Eagles’
Coach Richard Maloney could endure as he
immediately went to the bullpen.

“I’m being more aggressive and waiting for
my pitch,” Etsell said of his hitting terror. “I’m
just trying to make contact and get a hit. I feel
real good up there.”

“He’s getting into a zone,” Reese said,
“which every player dreams of being in. He’s
just staying focused and taking one pitch at a
time.”

What could have evoked Etsell’s “zone” was
his late—inning heroics against Geneva last
Thursday. Down 6-4 in the bottom of the sixth,
Etsell took the game into his own hands by
hitting a three—run homer to give Pitt a tempo-
rary lead.

Getting into a zone is not something a player
wakes up with, it’s something only hard work
can do that makes a good hitter into a “zoner.”

While most people were enjoying the sum-
mer, Etsell was in the Cost Center taking bat-
ting practice and other hitting drills.

However, hitters know that a zone can leave
as quickly as it comes. Before Etsell’s zone
kicked in, he struggled a little in Florida.

“He wasn’t hitting the ball as well,” Jackson
said. “It’s just a matter of getting some more at-
bats.” A player’s hitting always ﬂuctuates. But
one thing is for sure, if Etsell continues, his
“zone,” then he will see his name penciled in
as the third hitter for the rest of his career.

“The team did a nice job of
staying together,” shortstop
Danny Gonzalez said.

“When a team scores eight
runs in an inning, it’s easy to get
down. We just stayed together
and chipped away
and put some runs on the
board.”

BC tied the game at 11 in the
top of the seventh when
Clayton Beirne walked in a run
with the bases loaded and two
out. But Beirne pitched out of
the jam getting the next batter,

‘shortstop Tarez McNeil, to

ground into a short to second
fielder’s choice.
Pitt first baseman Craig

Crawley walked with one out in ’

the bottom of the seventh, and
BC followed that with an inten-
tional walk of Gonzalez.

Second baseman Scott Etsell’s
groundout to third advanced
Crawley and Gonzalez and set
the stage for DH Kurt
Womelsdorf. ’

Womelsdorf, who entered the
game in the sixth as a pinch
runner, fouled off several of
Steve Dunlea’s pitches before
hitting a hard grounder that car-
omed off the glove of diving BC
first baseman Brian Sankey.
Womelsdorf’s single scored
Crawley, and the Panthers won
12-11.

“I’m used to my role on the
team, and when I come in, I
know I have to get it done,”
Womelsdorf said.

“We saw the same kid in
Florida, and we hit him pretty
well. So I figured if I didn’t get
my pitch, I’d foul a bunch off
until I did. I finally got it,

much less difficult for the
Panthers, as they rode a hot
offense and excellent pitching
through the last two blowout
wins.

Saturday’s second game saw a
sick Tedde Campbell throw a
seven-inning complete game
three-hitter for Pitt. The right-
hander overpowered BC’s hit-
ters using a mid—80 mph fastball
to record seven strikeouts.

“I was real sick this moming,
and I was throwing up during
the game,” said Campbell. “But
I had a real good fastball today,
and my curveball was really
working. I was really focused
today.”

Pitt’s Etsell shook off two first
inning errors to lead the
Panthers’ offense with two two-
run doubles. His first double
came in the Panthers’ four—run
fifth, and his second highlighted
a three—run Pitt sixth.

“Scotty is one of those guys
who doesn’t let that kind of stuff
bother him too much,”
Gonzalez said.

“It’s good to see him bounce
back after a couple of errors
and have a good offensive
game.”

Sunday’s game was more of
the same for Pitt. Panther right-
hander Gregg Mrochko held BC
to three runs over nine innings
while striking out 11.

“I hit the glove most of the
day, and they helped me out by
chasing a lot of sliders that were
in the dirt,” Mrochko said. “I got
ahead in the. count, and that’s
the big thing in getting strike-
outs. I’m a groundball pitcher,
and the strikeouts are just
gravy.”

After BC scored three in the
top of the second, DeBemardis
led off the bottom of the inning
with a homer to left field. And
with one out and DH Tyler
Shantz on second, third base-

man josh Tyler tied the game-

with his second homer of the
series.

The game remained tied until
the bottom of the fifth when Pitt
exploded for nine runs. T wo-
run doubles by Gonzalez and
center fielder Bob Miller book-
ended a three—run homer by
Etsell.

Mrochko coasted the rest of
the way, giving up one hit over
the final four innings.

“When you go out there and
you have a nine-run lead, you
still have to stay focused, but it’s
great,” Mrochko said.

“If a guy gets on base, it’s no
big deal.”

Etsell led Pitt with eight RBI in
the series, and Tyler, Gonzalez
and DeBemardis each had four.
Mrochko upped his record to 4-
0, and Campbell jumped to 2-1.
Beirne earned his first win with
his three innings of
relief in Saturday’s first
game.

Erin Maloy was one of four seniors to play their ﬁnal game for the Panthers yesterday. Maloy scored a team-high 19 points
in Pitt's last game of the NWIT against Tulane yesterday. -

Continued from page 8
low post players Miller and
Huemrich scored 15 of Pitt’s first
19 points, and the Lady
Panthers stretched out to a 19-8
margin with just over 12 min-
utes left in the half. Pitt held
T ulaneto 24 percent shooting
in the opening half and took a
37-26 lead to the locker
room.

Tulane countered with a four-
guard lineup that gave Pitt trou-

ble. Tulane rallied quickly with
an 8-0 run to start the second
half, pulling within three at 37-
34. The Green Wave took their
first lead of the game at 41-40
on one of Christy Thomaskutty’s
two three-pointers.

The game was close the rest
of the way. Tulane failed in a
last chance to tie down 69-66
with only eight seconds, when
Deborah Rusch missed a three.

The seventh-seeded

Oklahoma Sooners (17-12) sent
the Lady Panthers into the third-
place game by pulling away late
for an 86-77 win on
Friday.

Bruce said the Panthers went
into the contest with the intent
of playing a half-court game
because Oklahoma had beaten
New Mexico State with an up-
tempo style in its opener.

Pitt was not able to deal with
the Sooners’ depth inside.

Oklahoma rotated five players
in the post. Huemrich (14 points
and 10 rebounds) and Miller
both fouled out down the
stretch. Oklahoma also had a
48-38 edge on the glass.

The Sooners led by only one
at the half, 39-38, but pulled

away late behind 63.5 percent
shooting from the floor in the
second half. Mandy Wade of
Oklahoma led all scorers with
25 points. Jenine Joyce led Pitt
with 17 points.

The move to a half-court
game against Oklahoma was a
switch for Pitt after trying to
push the ball against Gonzaga
in its opening game. Pitt was
able to do that enough to pull
out an 89-77 overtime
victory.

“In the Gonzaga game, we felt
like we were a little quicker and
we could run on them a little
bit,” Bruce said. “Sure enough,
we did. We ran the break pretty

well. We had to take it to that

team.”

Juanita Rivera, Gonzaga’s 6-
foot-4-inch center, was a con-
cern for Bruce entering the con-
test‘, but it was Pitt that con-
trolled the low post. Rivera had
ten points, while Huemrich
racked up game highs with 24
points and 16 rebounds. Miller
chipped in 18 points and nine
rebounds.

Joyce had another strong
game with 18 points and
Stephanie Petho came off the
bench with 14.

Pitt led what had been a close
contest 68-65 with only 13 sec-

onds left when Ivie Safranski '

(21 points) nailed a three—point
shot to send the contest into
overtime,

The Lady Panthers dominated
the extra period, starting with a
12-4 run. Safranski scored all
four. points, but fouled out with
1:23 remaining.

one dependable closer.

Bucco youngster Steve Cooke is
getting there, but they have
something to prove.

The list of closers starts and
ends with Cub Randy Myers.

Don’t even think of adding-

that list, at least until we see

If you have

Houston has plenty of other
firepower with second baseman
Craig Biggio (.287, 21 HR), first
baseman Jeff Bagwell (.320, 20
HR, 88 RBI) and left ﬁelder Luis
Gonzales (.315, 15 HR, 72 RBI,
20 SB) at the heart of the lineup
and solid players around them.

Drabek is too good to stay
down, and a healthy Swindell (a
rare thing) should improve the
big lefty’s numbers. Kile is a
young stopper in the making,
and Harnisch is the kind of
workhorse to build a staff
around.

Too bad the St.
Cardinals don’t have many
guys like that. Shortstop Ozzie
Smith exemplifies the changes
in St. Louis. His defense has
slipped a little the last few
years, but he seems to be get-
ting better with age offensively
(.288 with 21 SB last year). The
current Red Birds can hit, but
they were only 10th in the
league in fielding last year.

After Tewksbury, the pitching
staff ranges from‘ erratic to
unproven. If kids Allen Watson
and Tom Urbani come around,
however, the Cards have a very
good chance in the division.

Even if the starters come
around, who is going to finish
for them? Mike Perez and com-
pany did just fine last year set-
ting up Lee Smith, but now find-
ing a stopper (probably Perez)
is a major concern.

Scoring runs is no such prob-
lem. Gregg Jeffries, who finally‘
found a position (first base) last
season, put it all together with a
monster year (.342, 16 HR, 83
RBI, 46 SB). Todd Zeile is set-
tling in at the other corner with
103 RBI. These two are prob-
lems defensively, and the team

is unsettled at second base. .

T om Pagnozzi’s injury problems
add catching to the problem
areas.

The only problem with out-
fielders Bernard Gilkey (.305, 16
HR, 70 RBI, 15 SB), Brian Jordan
(.309, 10 HR and 44 RBI in only
223 at bats) and Mark Whiten
(.253, 25 HR, 99 RBI) is finding
playing time for Ray Lankford,
who was a rising star before he
was slowed by injuries last year.

The drama continues with the
Cincinnati Reds. Can Rob
Dibble come back to his old
dominating self? Will Kevin
Mitchell stay healthy (not likely)
or keep his weight down (even
less likely)? Can Marge Schott
keep ‘her mouth shut? (We
could never be so lucky.)

In truth, the Reds are putting
too much on a return to form
from John Smiley and Tom
Browning. Without the two left-
ies, Rijo has only erratic Erik
Hanson for support.

Start up the broken record
again — this team will score
runs. When healthy last year,
Mitchell was devastating (.341,
19 HR, 54 RBI in only 93
games). Outfield partners
Bobby Kelly and Reggie
Sanders are emerging stars.

Injuries also limited Barry
Larkin to 100 games and Hal
Morris to 101. Both are healthy
now and have a new playmate
in slugging second baseman

Bret Boone (12 HRs in 76
games).

With the Pittsburgh Pirates,
a lot depends on two pitchers
returning to form. Zane Smith
was rock-solid consistent for the
Bucs until he got hurt. Randy
Tomlin also had ‘93 mined by
injuries after an All-Star ‘92.

Neither is an ace, but if they
are solid, Pittsburgh can do
some damage. Tim Wakefield
has struggled in the spring and
was sent down to AAA Buffalo
on Friday while reclamation
project Scott Scudder has
looked strong and could take
the knuckleballer’s spot.

NYI. Central  

1.3.,  

 

Paul Wagner (8-8, 4.27) both
stepped in as rookies last year,
and Cooke showed signs of
being the real deal very soon.

Alejandro Pena was looking
like the closer the Bucs paid for
this spring until bleeding ulcers
sent him to the hospital. Mark
Dewey was solid (2-0, six saves)
in a late-season shot and will fill
in.

The Pirates will score runs,
especially with a healthy Andy
Van Slyke. The dynamic center
fielder was having a great sea-
son before he had an unpleas-
ant reunion with the wall in his
former home in St. Louis.

Van Slyke and shortstop Jay
Bell anchor a strong defense

Cooke (10-10, 3.89 ERA) and

(second in the league with a
.983 fielding percentage). Bell
broke Ozzie Smith’s hold’ on the
Gold Glove and broke loose
offensively with a .310 average.
Third baseman Jeff King does
not hit the dingers (nine), but a
.295 average, 98 RBI and a
glove that has golden potential
does the job just fine.

Orlando Merced has to prove
the .313 he hit last year was no
ﬂuke but he is a solid hitter. Al
Martin showed some of his big-
time potential (.281, 18 HR, 16
SB). Another reclamation pro-
ject, former Brave Brian Hunter,
could be the hammer in the
heart of the order that
Pittsburgh needs.

The story for the Chicago
Cubs in spring has been the
return of a player they may not
even need, shortstop Shawon
Dunston, who was ably
replaced by Jose Vizcaino.
Dunston may not even get his
job back.

The reason the Cubs aren’t
hopeless is that they have
Myers. They are the only team
in the division that can take a
lead into the ninth and know
they have a stopper out there
who can hold it.

Now if somebody else could
pitch in Chicago. Actually, Greg
Hibbard did a decent job with
15 wins and a 3.96 ERA, but he
wasn’t offered a contract. What

is it here, they don’t like good
pitchers named Greg?
(Remember Maddux?)

Supposed aces Jose Guzman
and Mike Morgan combined for
a 22-25 record last year, and
both had ERA’s over four. It gets
worse after that.

The Cubs will have to slug it
out at Wrigley, and they have
the guns to do it, especially with
Ryne Sandberg healthy. Mark
Grace used his sweet—as-honey
swing to hit .325 with 98 RBI,
and Sammy Sosa silenced some '
critics with 33 homers and 36
stolen bases. A lot could
depend on 25-year-old Karl
Rhodes stepping up in center
field.
