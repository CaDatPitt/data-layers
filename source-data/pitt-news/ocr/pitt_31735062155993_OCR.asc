the Student Prince-type plot. The
oﬂ.’-stage narration, ballet.‘ and vo-
cal eifects in Delta Sigma Phi and
Chi Omega’s “Tongo” gave that
show a third place rating.

Based on uniqueness, originality
of theme and design, and execu-
tion of idea, this year’s ﬁrst place
in show fronts was earned by Del‘-
ta Sigma Phi and Chi Omega
whose joint efforts resulted in a
giant grass hut construction. The
three dimensional Arabian Castle
front’ built by Phi Kappa Alpha
and Kappa Kappa ‘Gamma gave
the )two Greek groups second
place. Phi Gamma Delta and Kap-
pa Alpha Theta won third place
honors for their design of a Liech-
tenstein country scene.
. Carnival events started off Mon-

“Yes ’Lcrd”  

Given Repeat
Performance .

The ﬁnal production of the Pitt-

Players begins a three-day run in
Stephen Foster Memorial tomor-
row with a repeat performance of
William Douglas Home’s “Yes
M’Lord.” .

This play termed a “hilarious”
British farce” returns to Pitt by
popular request after a 'successfu_l

season last summer when it was I

presented by the Pitt Summer
Theater. ‘

' Jo Bosco and Jack Ingrim, stars
of last year’s production, have
consented to return to the campus
as guest stars in their original
roles of Lady. and Lord"'7Lister.

The play concerns the political A

defeat of Lord Lister’s, son, Tony,
in the elections for the House of
Parliament. Tony is defeated by

the family butler, Beecham. This‘

defeat creates a serious servant
problem for the Lister family and
their loss of Beecham. I '
' Tony’s losses _are great, too, for
he loses the election andhis ﬁan-

cee, Jean. In ‘his plight, he turns,

to Bessie, another servant. Beech-

am in a surprise ending resolves’

all the conﬂicts and remains the
loyal butler.

Included in the support cast are
Eugenie Reidmiller, Dorothy Tear,
Emil Herman, Bob Waterford,
Fonda Goldman, and Paul Mooney.

The comedy was ﬁrst produced
in England in 1947 where it-had
a- tremendous. success, appealing
to the British " humor, for: they

themselves poked fun at their own‘

short comings in the political sit-

.uation of 1945. r

The play also had a very suc-
cessful run in New York in. 11951.‘
A-. E. Matthews, the famous Brit-
ish actor played the role of Lord
Lister in both th_‘e‘British and New
York companies. It holds the dis-
tinction of being one of the'ﬁrst
productions televised in its entire-
ty on BBC—TV. .

“ ‘Yes M’Lord’ has proved to

be one of the most humorous and -
‘delightful plays of the Pitt Player

season,” according to Harvey J.
Pope, director. “The inter-play
from the comedy 'team of Bosco
and Ingram will certainly prove to
be an entertaining evening.”

Special 5-0-cent tickets are avail-
able for the Thursday evening per-
formance. Tickets for other eve-
nings are one dollar.

‘Favorite Speech Subject Is Latin American Custom

T eza Earned B. S. Hard Way

By BERNICE M. COHEN

Acquiring a Bachelor of Sci-
ence degree is difﬁcult enough
for the average American-
born Pittite, but Guatemalan-
born Mario Teza earned his
B.S. degree before he could speak
English ﬂuently. As a lecturer and
conversationalist in Modern Lan-

guage at Pitt, Teza recalls his col- _

lege days when_ he took half of his
notes in Spanish and the other half
in English.’ " g ‘
 .Students Call Him Senor
‘_ i ‘:«“The Senor,” as Teza is affec-
tionately" called by students in his

Spanish classes, has earned his
ILA. degree in Modern Languages
here at Pitt and is now working
~to.Ward his Ph.D. in the same sub-
ject.
,A habit that Teza has acquired
'-‘during his study of the English
language is to spend at least ﬁf-
oteen minutes a day writing various
'short passages. Mr. Teza recom-
-mends this to language Students,
‘for this practice enables the stu-
jdent to read better and to speak
more ﬂuently.

St. Vincent Grad
. .Teza earned his B.S. degree at
_St. Vincent College in Latrobe, Pa.
_As an undergraduate student, he
served as assistant histology in-
structor while majoring in biology.
‘He also founded and was president
.of a Latin American Club.
' Here‘ at Pitt, Teza was the ﬁrst
president of the steering commit-
tee of the International Club for
foreign and American undergrad-
uate students.
Likes to Speak
Speaking to groups, as a repre-
sentative of Pitt, on his favorite
subject of Latin America is one of
’ Teza’s more enjoyable activities.

e

‘Teza hopes to acquaint North.

; -Americans‘ more thoroughly -with
Latin Americancustoms. ._
He believes that most people
from the United States know Latin
-America only because of politics
2 and revolts, while these countries
have many other aspects of na-
tional interest to offer.

S. A. Schools Diﬁer

According to Teza, South Amer-
ican high schools and colleges dif-
fer from those in the United States
in that all students follow the same
curriculum and have no choice of
subjects. Latin American Univer-
sities follow the European attend-
ance plan, which permits the ‘stu-
dent an unlimited amount of ab-
sence as long as he completes his
required work. =
_ Teza lives in Squirrel Hill with
his wife andqdaughter. His hobbies
include photography, tennis, and
all types of sports especially hunt-

One of the most exciting ex-

his trip with his father in 1939 on
the then new Pan American Road.
The Tezas traveled from Guate-
mala City to San Francisco to View
the World’s Fair. The road was

unﬁnished and according ‘to Teza,

“the trip is something I’ll never

In addition to his busy schedule
of teaching and speaking, Teza is
also working hard on his United

hopes to obtain shortly.

These three sports have been played‘ in collegiate com-

from the club basis in’ which they originated. With the
acquisition of more men and the increased skills of those
already on the squads, the Athletic Department decided
that the time was ripe to move into the upper bracket. 
The fact that these sports are on a varsity level does
not mean that Pitt will have national champs next year.
But an active interest on the part of the student body
would certainly provide a very helpful shot in theJai1‘)m.

ll-"estival Spirit   I

Much has already been said in praise of the Spring Fes-
tival this year- Perhaps plaudits in another form would
not be redundant but rather apropos. . _

Final dances such as have been the custom with Spring
Festivals have been maligned as needlessly expensive af-
fairs that serve no real purpose‘ and should be eliminated
t,o__,-conserve the funds involved for more signiﬁcant events.
The success of ,“One Whirl” last Saturday night ,.is evi-

dence enough for the continuance of the Spring FeS.tiVa1\
Main Ball. The real spirit and interest generated at the

Ball through the community of thoughtwas one of the ﬁner
displays given by students at Pitt. It would be .a shame to
eliminate this .opportunity for a University social event
that appeals to such a large segment of the population here.
, This year, “One Whirl” also functioned as the ﬁnal sdcial
event of the year for the University as a whole. Its a .
good thing. Let’s not lose‘ it. ‘

By John De-Ninno

Except for the Spring Carnival
shows most ‘of the theatrical tal-
ent around Pitt is disgustingly
wasted. Anyone who saw the
shows at the Carnival last week
will readily agree that we need
not feel inferior to any other col-
lege or uni-
versity when
it comes to en-
tertainment.

pear quite inferior. The “Cap
and Gown” revue was an annual
event here until World War II
ended the tradition, like it had
done -to so many other University
customs. _

“Cap and Gown” was present-
ed in the old Nixon Theater.
When the war came it was dis-
continued but in 1946 an attempt
was made to revive it. That year,

Theatrical Talent Wasted 

Musical Review?

using half the budget previous
revues had, the show was held at
Stephen Foster Memorial and
earned a proﬁt of $700. The fol-
lowing year saw the production
losing money and interest, so it
was quietly dropped from the
campus scene.

These revues were composed
entirely of male students who
played both male’ and female
roles. The Cap and Gown Club
was considered one of the Uni-
versity’s outstanding organiza-
tions and the shows were always
a credit to the school and the per-
formers. Gene Kelly, of Holly-

‘wood fame, starredbin the revues

while an undergraduate and later
returned to be choreographer for
“Cap and Gown.”

Almost all of the major col-
leges and univ.ersities in the
country have -such revues. For

example Tech has its “Scotch and

Soda,” and Princeton’s shows are
produced by the Triangle Club.
Some of these productions have
.toured the country, as did the

’ “Cap and Gown” in its heyday.

One of the biggest obstacles to
the return of “Cap and Gown” to
Pitt is the ﬁnancial problem. The

Six Pittites Attend Talks

“Ni hao ma?” said Mr. Teng Ssu-Yu. And six Pitt stu-

An unexpected but very pleasant announcement came
Monday when Ronnie Gainsford, an All-American for the
Panthers for the past two seasons, received appointment as
head coach at the YM&WHA, a proving ground for local high school
stars. On the surface, this doesn’t seem likea huge gain for the Uni-
versity but closer analyzation shows some interesting details.

’It’s no secret that in the past, relations between Pitt and Y
haven’t made for Pittsburgh talent to be overly interested in
coming here to further their education. Not that we haven’t got-

* ten some good swimmers but the fact that Al Wiggins, HOW at

I now at Yale, and ' Ross McCarty,
formerly of Niagara, have migrated to foreign schools doesn’t
say much for the pulling power of Pitt.

Reason for this friction has not been disclosed because it has
never reached such an, adverse point‘ where an investigation was

Ohio State, Joe Robinson,

necessary.

But comes the dawn and the notice that Gainsford takes over
June 28 at the Belleﬁeld pool. and faces brighten in theiathletic de-
partment. V With‘ a former star pupil at the head coaching job there,

“ Coach Ben Grady can now count on getting almost all the outstanding
mermen in the Tri—state district, not just a few. T A
I Besides those mentioned above, the Y has, through the years,
produced many excellent men, meaning that this move should bring
this highe? calibre of swimmers here.

In fact, Gainsford, a Schenley high graduate, learned his basic
strokes at the nearby pool. Unfortunately, others did’ not make
the same college choice as the Panther star and have, as a result,

A 7 come back to hurt Pitt.
' ‘ However, with Gainsford as “chief rusher” in the farm system,
athletic ofﬁcials know that Pitt will get the best of the local crop. It
deﬁnitely brightens ‘the outlook forlPitt swimming, giving hope to the
idea that this sport may eventually also move into the high-ranking
fame some of the other sports have recently. ,

_ So, with this lucky break in bringing the outstanding men here,
facilities to match the talent would be in order.‘

Is‘ anybody listening?

N otters Host
State Today

- Jim Tully’s tennis squad goes
back into action this afternoon af-
ter a long layoff when Penn State
invades the Mellon Park courts at
2 p.m.

The Nittanies, a ‘traditionally
tough team which has downed Pitt
the last two seasons, ﬁgure to tack
on Pitt’s second loss of the spring.
The Panthers have won four and
are far ahead of last season’s rec-
ord, which read 2-3 in the. ﬁrst
ﬁve matches. _

Pitt will be the host again Sat-
urday when they take on W&J,
which dropped both meetings to
the Blue-and—Gold last year.

Expected to wield the racquets

Varied Offense,
Soph Gridders,
Highlight Final

Spring football ended last Sat-I

urday at the Stadium when Red
Dawson put his charges through
an intra—squad game that gave the

local rooters a view on the nevi

type oﬁense to be used this year.

The supposed _regulars, the
“Blues,” whipped the “Golds,”
15-3, butboth sides looked equally
effective. Naturally, many of the
offensive innovations were not on
displaylat the closing event but
enough variety was shown to ex-
pect more in the fall.

The fellows who are to be soph-
omores in the fall also impressed.
Halfback Nick Passodelis of Ali-
quippa, End Joey Walton of Beav-
er Falls, and Quarterback Bill
Amos of Washington‘ received ac-
claim from the coaches. for. their
play in the ﬁnale. ‘

Another bright spot ‘was vet
Rudy Mattioli who. passed to Pas-
sodelis for a Blue score. The other
touchdown ,was tallied by soph
Corny ‘Salvaterra on a- pitchout
while junior Gene Steratore kick-
ed a ﬁeld goal for the Gold points.

Star Fin Appointed

Ronnie Gainsford, captain of the
1953-54 swimming team, has been

appointed head coach at the YM &_

WHA on Belleﬁeld Ave. ,
Gainsford had probably been
slated ‘to take over as freshmen
coach for the Panthervarsity after
his graduation. but announced" the

new position Monday.

  

5 THE Loelc Mason,-

WHO HATED

 

Recently a young mid-westcrner enrolled at a

university as 9. Logic major.

His father had told him,

with some understatenient, that he was illogical. He refused
to squire a pretty girl to a dance because her name was
June Betz and he was against gambling.

He wouldn't eat avocados because they were also called
“alligator pears" and he didn't like alligators.‘

In addition, he was a slob.

\ _

Some of the men in his dorm tried to talk to him.

/ “Look at that shirt,” they said. “The material's cheesy.

Why don’t you hop down and get a Van Heusen

2

Oxfordian . . . it's soft, ﬁne oxford cloth.”

“I’m not attending Oxford. I’m attending Old Siwash,” _

answered our boy.

“But, look, Buster. This oxford cloth is woven tighter
so it’ll last longer. I_t’s a smart investment.

And it only costs $4.50.”

.“So who needs it? I might get hit by a truck. Then what
good would it be?” quoth Buster.

"What about your collar? Flat -as a pancake! Don't you
want a goodlooking button-down with that famous
Van Heusen relaxed—ro1i?” one asked.

“I got nothing against pancakes. I hate rolls."

Note: Our man fluriked Logic post haste, and was drafted.
The Army has him classiﬁed under “Secret Weapons."
