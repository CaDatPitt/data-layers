Writers’ Conference i 
On Again for March

The Fourth Annual Writers’
Conference, cancelled in early

November because of insufficient

funding, will be held March. 27 and

.the School of General Studies
(SGB) Cabinet and the Student
Union Board (SUB), according to
Lee Gutkind, assistant English
professor.-

‘‘If it wasn’t for the interest and
cooperation of General Studies and

"the Student Union Board, there
could never have been a Writers’
Conferenceusince Student Activi-
ties withdrew their support,”
Gutkind said.

_The Writers’ Conference was
cancelled when Student Activities
cut the $1500 conferenceallocation
out of its budget.

“SUB and General Studies
Cabinet made up for that deﬁcit,”
Gutkind said. “That doesn’t
necessarily mean we have as much
money as last year, but we have
enough to get the conference off
the ground.”

The SGS cabinet offered $1,200
to support the conference and SUB
pitched in $500. Other principal
means of revenue for the confer-
ence were derived from the English
department ($500), CAS ($1,250)

_ and ticket sales. .

Gutkind hopes the deficit will be

eased through a raise in the ticket

price from $3 to $4.

The conference itself is still in

Pitt Facing Labor UnitCarve

’ B.Y MATTHEW KENNEDY

Although it’s not immediately
apparent, a state decision to carve
the University into four separate
bargaining units will have a large

-impact on the University and the

coming campaign elections.
According to an information leak
in the Harrisburg-based Pennsyl-
vania Labor Relations Board, that
body is now‘ looking at a proposal
that would create four bargaining
units or “communities of - labor
interest” at Pitt: one for the Law
School, one for the Medical School,
one for the health-related profes-
sions~and one for all the remaining

- schools in the provost’s area.

If this proposal is accepted with

N little or no modification by the .

Board, the division may lead to a
focus of union strate y

$5,000 in Emergency

Loan Funds Available

BY T OMMIE NELL TAYLOR

There is now more than $5,000 in
the Student Government Emergen-
cy Loan Fund (SGELF), according
to Louis McLinden, assistant
director of Student Activities.

The Emergency Medical Loan
Fund (EMLF) and the Legal
Awareness Fund (LAF)—merged
in 1972 to become the SGELF—— has
$5,075.93 in a current joint
account, McLinden said. The
EMLF contains $1,828.16 and the
LAF, $3,247.77.

The EMLF initially became
operative in 1971 with $3,000. With
a written authorization from a
physician, a student was eligible to
receive a maximum loan of $100, to
be repaid within a year.

Medical student Marc Hiller, the
original administrator of the fund,
said the loans were made to pay for
glasses, medication, psychiatric
help and abortions.

STATE PARK LIFEGUARD JOBS

The Pennsylvania Civil Service
Commission is accepting applica-
tions for lifeguards and lifeguard
supervisors in the state parks.

Persons interested in these
positions ‘can obtain Announce-
mcnt 57-75 and application forms
from the Civil Service Commission
Ofﬁces in Pittsburgh and from
state park offices.

Applications must be ﬁled with
the commission by Jan. 16.

Announcement 57-75 lists those
Parks that will require an estimated
120 new lifeguards and 30 new
supervisors for the 1976 season.
The announcement also contains a
description of the positions, qualifi-
cations required and examination
and application procedures.

Weather permit-ting, public
swimming facilities in state parks
will be open daily between 11 a.m.
and 7 p.m. from Memorial—Day
through Labor Day. Lifeguards and
supervisors are required to work
weekends and holidays and fre-
quently must work overtime. They
must purchase their own swimsuits
in a model specified by the
department.

YWCA WINTER PROGRAMS

The YWCA Hill District Center
offers a wide range of activities
from Powder Puff auto mechanics
to karate, and from guitar (for
teens) to sewing. Complete pro-
gram information for adults and
young women is available by
calling the Hill District Office.

Membership in the YWCA offers
many free programs as well as
classes on a fee basis. Scholarships
are available.

Registration for the winter
program is open until January 16
either by mail or in person.

Information and a free booklet
may be obtained by calling
566-1500.

Hiller said the fund is adminis-
tered by the Medical Act on
Committee, which as accountable
to the Student Government Board
(SGB).

In November, 1972, the SGB
merged the medical and legal
funds. SGB President Larry Platt
said this week that he would call a
meeting with the chairmen of the
Legal Awareness Committee and
the Emergency Medical Commit-
tee, and the Director of Student
Activities and Loan Collection
Officer Frank Cendar to discuss
possible separation of the funds.

“We’ll also consider how to
collect past due accounts,” Platt
said, “and propose a new
procedure for getting loan funds.”

HOSPITALS HIRE EXTRA

LOS ANGELES (AP) - With no
hint of a break in stalled
negotiations in the malpractice
insurance crisis, plans were set up
yesterday to hire extra medical
personnel for overloaded public
hospitals bearing the brunt of the
week-old doctors’ slowdown.

A hospital association official
said, however, he believed most
doctors who planned to withhold
services had done so by now.

“I don't think we are seeing a
number of new physicians taking
part each day,” said Leon Hauch of
the Hospital Council of Southern
California.

“The hospitals are feeling the
impact of the slowdown that began
Jan. 1. The question is now, how
long can everybody stand the
pressure?”

STATE OFFICIALS LOSE JOBS

HARRISBURG (AP) - A number
of state department and agency
officials, including two-thirds of the
Horse Racing Commission, lost
their jobs this week when their
interim appointments expired.

They all lacked the needed
Senate confirmation. A recent
change in the state Constitution
abolished the governor’s interim
appointment power, used last year
to put the people in office without
Senate approval.

The racing commission was the

most seriously affected. The~

nomination of commission chair-
man Alfred Johnson of Pittsburgh
was voted down. The Senate never
voted on commissioner Harris
Lipez‘ of Lock Haven.

SELF-DEFENSE FOR WOMEN

Self-defense courses for women
of high school age or older
sponsored by Pitt’s Women’s
Center and taught by the Feminist
Karate Union will begin Jan. 27

and 28 at the Falk School
Gymnasium, Allequippa Street,
Oakland.

Two beginners’ classes will be
offered on Tuesdays from 7 to 8:30
p.m. and Wednesdays from 5:30 to
7 p.m. An intermediate class is
available Wednesdays from 7 to
8:30 p.m. Formal karate training
for advanced students is scheduled
Tuesday, Wednesday and Thurs-
day evenings from 8:30 to 10.

Inquiries and registration forms
may be obtained by mailing a
self-addressed, stamped envelope
to Cassandra George, 1205 Hill

After reading your story ‘about

x

November 23), "several friends who
did not attend the meeting were

i.  under the mournful impression that

 T the issue was dead. The chance of
 resurrecting it suggested by Dean

. matter isn’t over yet. Someone else

can bring- up another resolution”

 was too remote and theoretical a

'~-.-possibility to comfort them.

But

BY TOM WASELESKI

Had someone told mea year
ago that downtown Pittsburgh
would be the scene of . a
demonstration of some 10,000
chanting, rallying people, I would
have dismissed the conversation as

a hoax and the converser as a

, charlatan who was perhaps a dupe
for the CIA testing my fervor for
armed revolution on the very

‘- thresholds of the L’Amour Theatre

and the New Diamond Market.
Had this imaginary Daniel
prophesied more speciﬁcally and
let slip that the massive mobiliza-
tion was to be provoked by an event
no less than KDKA’s'ﬁring of Bob
Prince and Nellie King, (surely a
prince and a king, telling by the

mob’s.adulaticn) as radio announ- ‘-

cers for the. baseball Pirates, I
wouldhave sadly understood the
man’s portents of gloom and
immediately lamented such a waste
of human energy.. After all, they
could’ve been home opening beer
cans. or making spitoons out of
. cottage cheese containers.

Pittsburgh’s much-touted ‘_‘shot_

and a beer” image aside though, I
doubt that few majorcities, if any,
would have responded differently
to‘ the firing of its leading
sportscasters. n _‘ _

‘Which to me suggests that sports
in America has‘ gotten too big for its
britches.

The evidence is there. It- just
takes a minute to take off the
blinders before it hits one smack in
the face. _

and arts news.

motions because they did not go far
enough. rather than because they‘
went too far. ,

Similarly, the October meeting
threw out the motion presented by
Professor Stehle and endorsed by

FASC, which stuck even closer to t

the status quo. and voted instead to
consider Schulman’s motion. To
me. these votes suggest that the
present system is at least as
unpopular as any of the alterna-
tives to it considered so far.
Whether the alternative I am

proposing will prove any more.
‘popular is something we won't

know until after the February
mcciing. butat least it will offer
the faculty a clear choice. not a
slightly muflled'echo.

(what could you possibly have to

say?), sometimes sports weather,

American interest in celebrities up,

“People in Sports.”

Have a band of black writers or a_
similar group ask for V such an
all-encompassing section in a major
daily and you’re lookin’ for trouble,
buddy. ‘ ’

Not news to ‘most is the fact that
organized sports has helped foster

. sexism by creating roles that men '
and women play on and off the

ﬁeld. It takes only a short time at a
football ame to notice the brute
force on the gridiron and the
contrasting glamour and pep
manifested in spread thighs on the
sidelines. .

The permanence of such roles
suggests obviously that that’s how
it is, baby: you got the men on the‘
ﬁeld and the chicks crooning for
Johnnie to come marching home
again, hurrah, hurrah, bringing
home a big combat victory as if the
Sun, Bowl turf were the sands of
Iwo Jima.

Cities see themselves as adver-
sary powers whose alliances

‘ depend on the particular season;

during football and baseball the foe

is Cinncinatti, during hockey and

tennis the’ enemy is Philadelphia.
Speaking of tennis, an important

_ element. in ‘American sports nowa-

days is the entrepreneur, the man
who tells you which" ' new sport ’

.you’re going to like: Team tennis is

local

his latest success, ‘with
personalities urging. us

supporting some new war. effort '
that required us to r/ation gasoline
and nylon stockings.

, Dismal failures in business like
the World Football League make it
necessary that sports’ big money
men succeed at something like
team tennis or else where would

they get the additional capital to

another crack at the WFL?

Clearly, so many sports are

being offered that help foster so -\_v.-\\A;

many great American
(aggressiveness, shrewd business
management, etc.) that Americans
ﬁnd them hard to digest.

Even when the arena or the
stadium is closed (incidentally,
never at the same time) we cannot

. escape the jargon and the mentality

of sports. The President reveals
his “game plan” tohalt inflation; a
candidate for ofﬁce no longer
tosses his hat into the ring, but
decides to “pick up the ball and
run.” _

It’s hard to remember a recent
President who hasn’t played

something for somebody, Though a

it would‘ be near impossible" to  7"?’

deﬁne how much influence sports
has had on the way they lead, it's at
the same time interesting to
contemplate what would have been
the effect of no huddles or play
patterns.
Even more fascinating would be V

the results of a study on' the role

sports plays in shaping political
attitudes. No effect whatsoever,
you say?

Let’s reverse the preference of
the nation’s popular pastimes for a
minute. What would’ be your
reaction to a news report that said,
“With the primaries approaching,

ideals A .% '-

the Democrats will stage a dress 

rehearsal to see if any semblance of 

party unit can hold up for the
November eflections,” or, “Presi-
dent Ford and Dr. Kissinger can no
longer manage a fragile pas de
deux on foreign policy.” '

The subtle yet constant effect of
our, pastimes, particularly that of
sports. cannot be shrugged off. It’s
.certainly something to think about
while waiting for the Star in the
East to shift its heavenly tail and sit
placidly over the Point ‘next

weekend.

  Using the Interest

&:‘*'~ The recent argument between

Student Government and the
administration concerning the dis-
position of money earned as
interest on the funds assembled

logically entitled to that interest,
usually do not pursue the matter
because the amount per individual
is sczirecely noticeable.

The broader question, I suppose,

should have some right to be
involved in the allocation of those
funds which are. logically speak-
ing. theirs. In a sense, student
government was taking a position
ofthis sort in raising the question
in the first place. A second
approach would be to launch a
critical evaluation of, the adminis-
tration’s use of these “extra”
funds. Just a few days after

 i “I’m perfectly convinced that
the Alternative Curriculum. (AC)
‘ -makes educational sense, social
‘. and political sense, and is lots more
fun,” Dr. David Bramhall, econo-
mics professor and AC faculty
* member said recently.

._ enabling students to do course
work outside the usual departmen-
tal structure. AC grew out of
g_1en_1ands.for_ curriculum reform at
‘.‘Pitt, beginning with the Concerned

Students and Faculty sit-in of 1969.
-‘ '-“The Left then had a lot of
media-produced feeling that there
must ‘be an instant answer,”
_ Bramhall said. “They didn’t have

-haul, to settle in for the long march
_through the institutions.” '

A AC began in September, 1973,
after four years of planning and
proposals. ' '. A

A “Since then, I ﬁnd myself

put‘-down attitudes,” Bramhall
_ said. “There is an idea that
nothing can be done.”
' AC began with an initial
, enrollment of 120. Ninety students
. continued the program in the
1 winter of 1974. Participants
_ numbered 40 the following Septem-
"ber. .
. Bramhall said, “I feel that there
was a decline mainly ‘because
students coming in the first years
‘of the program had heard about
alternative education from high
school. There was media coverage
* of it. Thereafter they are less likely
’ tohave heard. ‘ _
V “Students are now more likely to
‘feel economic security is the reason
for their being in school.”
To compensate for declining
«enrollment, AC faculty are consi-
-dering a proposal to ,make the
. program available to CAS students
' after their freshman year.
 “The group we have totry to talk
to,‘ to convince to try the program}
I isioccupied with making decisions.
.aboi__it leaving home and coming to
, ‘college,’’Bramhall ‘said. ‘‘All the
, _mailed information they receive
‘ blurs before their eyes. Then they
come to orientation, which is a
circus in itself.
“It”s a very bad way to try and
explain something that’s new and
different in education.’ ’

DR. DAVID BRAIVIHALL

Bramhall believes AC has made
accomplishments, despite lessened
student interest.

“I have a strong feeling about
qualitative progress. We’ve
learned a lot about how to run AC.
In fact, we’re still learning -a lot.

,“But I think what_t,hat meant is‘
that a signiﬁcant number of
students in AC’s second and third
year of operation are getting a
strong feeling of self-worth and self
conﬁdence. They are increasing
their ability to use the rest of their’

education, for their own life
purposes.’

AC is now doing an evaluation
that compares the first group of AC
students with a control group of
non-AC freshmen from that year.

“My expectation is that .this
study will show no signiﬁcant

difference in’grades,” Bramhall ~

said. “The signiﬁcant difference
will be in what we've always felt‘

the program was about, the sorts of _

people they are becoming.” -

Last year's AC group toured
New England by bus at the end of.
the winter term, visiting schools
with alternative educational pro-
grams. '

Bramhall said, ' ‘fWe  went
thinking we’d learn from their
experiences. We came‘ back
feeling we had taught as .much as
we had learned. In many
instances, we felt we had a better
program here. Ithink everyone felt
proud that we had done a good
job.” . . . -_

BY MAGGIE McKAY

Over the years, criticism of the
standard educational system has
grown. Critics charge that
universities are concerned increas-
ingly with job preparation and less
with giving students a comprehen-
sive education. As a result, there
has been a signiﬁcant growth in the
-development of alternatives to
traditional education across the
country. .

‘Pitt’s ‘own Alternative Curric-
ulum (AC) program, designed
speciﬁcally for freshmen, is one
attempt to lessen the_ separation
"between education and extracur-
ricular life. -. -

“Freshpeople are influenced by
job markets‘ and career goals much
more deeply than_ in previous
years,” said Dan Tannacito,
assistant English professor and one
of AC’s core faculty members.
“Society in general pressures them
to measure quantitatively, but real
learning isn’t measured by
grades.” - _ I '

According to Tannacito, AC
attracts ,students who think their
past education was insufﬁcient.

Throughout the year, freshmen
take responsibility for the structure
of the program, deciding what will

be studied and how.

Working with faculty members,
the students set up workshops and
participate in learning-skills
groups. ' r .

“People need to develop a way of
coming to an evaluation of the work
they are doing in terms satisfactory
to themselves,” Tannacito said. ‘‘I
ﬁnd the level of involvement and
the commitment of the students
and the types of subjects the
students are interested in ‘as very
hopeful signs‘ for education.”

In addition to the AC program,
the Collective for Alternative
Education (CAE),
interested students, faculty and
coinmunity members, was recently
formed to explore and promote
alternatives in education on the Pitt
campus and in local communities.

“We ﬁnd ourselves in opposition
to the structure of education, the
CAE constitution says, “which
fosters a separation between
education and life, and promotes

destructive attitudes and actions

towards people...”

The CAE’s aim is to analyze
education in theory and practice, to
explore alternatives and to estab-
lish projects based - on these
alternatives.

Alternative Curriculum program.

One project already under way is
an evaluation. of how 80s-level
course are serving students.
Another planned project is a study
of Pitt politics: “Who Rules Pitt?”

Many students participating in_
alternative education are enthus-
iastic and like the program.

“.1 don’t feel much teaching or
learning is going on outside
Alternative Curriculum,” said Joel
Young, an AC student.

“When I get out of AC, I am

going 'to use the University to
construct’ my own education,
ﬁnding teachers willing to take the
time to help me. Someone who
cares about himself should be
willing to direct what he's
learning.”

Many AC students have evalua- A

Detective Flicks in Season

BY M.C. PILECKI

No Christmas movie season"

would be "complete without its
share of detective ﬂicks.

Actually, it probably would be,
but Hollywood never wants to find
out. So every year there’s another
offering in probably the single most
overdone genre in modern mass
entertainment. One begins to think
the gumshoes. eventually will trip
over each other. ’

But at least this season wasn’t
inundated with shoot-’em-ups.

Leading the pack is a comedy, '

The Black Bird, a -gentle satire on
old Humphrey Bogart detective
movies, and in particular a retake
of the classic Maltese Falcon. As a
comedy, it works well.

The ﬁlm stars George Segal (who
also produced the movie) as Sam
Spade Jr., the son of the character
Bogey made so famous. Junior has
inherited the bu-siness, which he
hates, his father’s secretary, whom
he hates even more, and, of course,
the name, which creates all kinds of
embarassing situations in the black
neighborhood. Bogey never had to
contend with that.

And, more important to the

story, Junior inherited the lead,

statuette that created so much fuss
in The Maltese Falcon. Again, a lot
of people are after the bird, the
value of which is still in question.
‘The result is a bizarre mystery,
mixed with a kindly celebration of

. the old detective movies, with all

the cliches intact—satirized, but
not blownyapart. Much like Robert
Altman’s' hero of The Long
Goodbye, Spade Jr. is definitely an

‘anachronism, but is not played as a

fool. Rather, he occasionally has a

“ grasp of the situation—he hasn’t

the urbanity of his father, but he’s
no clod. ~
The story is set in contemporary

San Francisco, but often wanders, .
. making for an interesting look at

the transitory nature of time and
'place., There’s Spade Jr. in the
traditional _black suit, white shirt,
and narrow black tie loose at the

  
 
   
  
    

open collar, wearing a turned down
hat, looking for all the world like a
refugee from the '40s but cruising
through a fairly hip black neighbor-
hood. He goes into his building,
where the murder of a “Fat Man”
has been committed, and is
immediately accosted by a police-
man who, likewise, seems to have
forgotten that the '40s have
passed. V

Then—whoosh—back to contem-
porary reality in the office, peopled
by the weirdos one never did see in
those old movies. The movie

.persists in losing its place in

history.

Throughout the movie, with
background photographs and fre-
quent mentions of the father, the
spirit of the original Sam Spade
never is quite lost. Black Bird
seems to'be saying not that the
original Spade was ridiculous, but
simply that he was unreal. Segal
seems to have been a longtime
Bogey fan who tried to recreate the
image of a favorite movie, while
being original and entertaining
about-it. »

If you’re one to get hung up on

the late show, particularly on the

post-WWII detectives, then you’ll
probably find that Black Bird hits a

soft spot. It’s fun, never too silly,
entertaining and occasionally
bizarre. , — _
Robert Aldrich and Burt Rey-
nolds prefer to play it straight with

their contribution to the movie9;“i'

Hustle. The last time the director’
and macho star got together, it was
for a comedy-based drama that
worked fairly well, with the great,
double-entendre title, The Longest
Yard.

Hustle could have used some of
the same spirit. As it is, it’s a
plodding detective story as unreal
as any other (including Black Bird)
that attempts to throw around some
social signiﬁcance. ‘ What it throws
around is, of much .earthier
substance.

’ For years, women’s sports at Pitt

. A: have needed a genuine,- 100%,
A ’ honest-to-Evert superstar. A fe-

male counterpart to Tony Dorsett,
if youwill. And, at long last, there
are several women whose claim to
fame is undeniable. But one name
stands out above the rest—Debbie
Jones.

And whether she’s spiking a

-volleyball high over the nets at the

Regionals competition, or diving
after a rebound on the basketball
court, she plays with total
concentration and unvarying excel-
lence. , d .
Probably the most amazing

A 1, _—indication of Jones’ athletic talent

is .her' twao years on the Pitt
-volleyball team. Before her fresh-

.man year, she’d never played

competitive volleyball. But with
long hours of practice, Jones
became an integral part of the
team.

You could say she and the

" Pantherette volleyball team grew

up together—both are in ' their
sophomore year at Pitt and both are

. on the rise in the world of collegiate
’ sport. And Jones personiﬁes the

unselﬁsh, total team effort that
Head Coach Mary Kromer wants.

- A “First of all, I think of Debbie as
 -' A a person,” Kromer said. “She’s

very mature and coachable and

. humble. As an athlete, she’s only

been with this sport a short time
and- she plays very well. She’s
extremely unselﬁsh, not out for
personal goals, an all-around team
player. She can only get better; she

. works hard to improve.”

signed Does It All  
For Pitt Pantherettes 1

Although Jones is a volleyball
standout, she is best-known as
“Big Red,” the center for the
Pantherette basketball team.

Encouraged by a family friend,
Jones started playing basketball
during her freshman year in high
school at Sharpsville, "Pennsyl-
vania, and lettered during three of
her four years with the team.

Last season, Jones averaged 13
points and 12 rebounds per game

for Pitt. During this. year’s Pitt, 

Invitational, she upped her average

to 14.7 points and scooped up 20.7 .

rebounds. Jones’ greatest talent is
her rebounding—she collected 30
bounds against Glassboro in the
Invitational. Her prowess is espec-
ially important, as defense is the
mainstay of the Pantherettes’
attack.

“We more or less rely on our
defense. There’s never a day when
we're off on it. Defense is our
game—our offense will come,”
Jones said.

Surprisingly, Jones’ favorite
aspect of the game is passing.

‘'1 love to pass,” she said.

Her biggest problem is overlap-
ping seasons. This year found the
volleyball team preparing for the

Regionals during the ﬁrst fewA

weeks ‘of basketball practice, and
Jones was dribbling up and down
the court at 7:30 a.m., perfecting
her volleyball serve in the
evenings, and keeping up with her
studies in the meantime.

Pitt News

 

BY YAIER LEHRER
Associate Sports Editor

Joe Louis vs. Max Schmeling,‘
Jack Dempsey vs. Gene Tunney,
Muhammad Ali vs. Joe Frazier and
Pitt vs. West.Virginia in basketball
share one thing in common-—no
combatant leaves the ﬁeld of play
without his share of cuts and
bruises. Wednesday night’s game
against the Mountaineers was a

prime example of this, as the

Panthers outbrawled the visitors,
70-61, at the Pitt Field-House.
With the West Virginia fans
emitting a shout of “Beat the Hell
out of Pitt” from the south stands
and with arms and elbows ﬂying
freely on the basketball court, it
was only a matter of time before a
ﬁght broke out. The only question
was whether the ﬁght would start

‘in the stands or on the basketball

court. The ﬁght, or ﬁghts, -as it
turned out, started on the court.
It all began innocently enough
when Scott Nedrow pumped in a
jumper'to put the Cats out in
front, 2-0. The sophomore from
Donora scored six more points
within the next four minutes to help ~
the Pitt team take an early 12-3
lead over the favored Moun-_

' taineers.

No matter how hard they tried,
the Mgunties coi1ldn’t even buy a A

basket, much less shoot one, as Pitt
jumped out to a 22-8 lead. Unable
to break the Panther defense, the
Mounties ﬁnally fell behind by'20
points, 38-l8—and that's when all
the trouble started.

While Tiger Paul—yes, Tiger
Paul, dressed in an ‘ill-ﬁtting
leisure suit—did the Bump to the
tune of the Pitt ﬁght song, the
Mountaineer fans» poured their
abuse onto the court. And while
players’ ﬂailing arms and elbows
made indentations in each others’
bodies, Wayne Talbott and
Maurice Robinson started going at
it Frazier-style, both absorbing and
delivering punches.

Both players were ejected from
the game, but it turned out that the
Talbott-Robinson scufﬂe was
merely the preliminary bout. The
rest of the game was characterized
by cheap shots from both sides,
erupting finally into a fight
between Tom Richards and Stan
Boskovich. Richards twisted his
ankle in the brouhaha.

“I'm ashamed of the way our
players reacted,” said West
Virginia Coach Joedy Gardner.
“They_A_ij_e_acted out of _frustratiQn.’f

AThe frustration certainly didn’t

show in'the beginning of‘ the-

second half, when the Mounties
narrowed the Pitt lead from 41-22

to 43-39, outscoring the Cats" 17-2 ,

in the opening minutes of the half.

It was a great individual effort by
supersoph Larry Harris that helped
keep the Panthers ahead. With the
score 45-41, Harris took a pass

from Bob Shrewsbury ‘for an easy.

two points and followed that with
another eight points, outscoring
West Virginia 10-5, and making the
score 55-46.

Though Harris performed some
heroics, awards for MVP of the
game should go to Willy Kelly.

 

“TIGER PAUL” ASLANDER returned the Pitt ﬁeld house last

night in all his glory, doing the Bump with the Pitt Panther. Instead of
his usual white shirt and bow tie, everyone’s favorite newsboy
appeared in a leisure suit. Hopefully, Paul will be allowed to stay on

this time.

basketball team. But the attention
hasn’t affected her.

‘TIt’s nice to get publicity-
everybody likes publicity—-but I
don’t go around with a swelled
head,” Jones laughed.

(4-1-1) will return to friendlier
conﬁnes. tomorrow to face an old
rival, the Duquesne Dukes.

Face-off for the Civic Arena
contest is scheduled for 1 p.m.

Duquesne is one of the two

teams (Carnegie-Mellon the othﬁ."
that stayed on the Pitt schedule"

after the Panthers’ departure from
and subsequent collapse of the
Western Pennsylvania Intercol-
legiate Hockey Association.

The Panthers see Duquesne as a
formidable opponent, A and captain
Rick Vernon thinks the game will

‘ be interesting. 7

“Like C-MU, Duquesne will be
ﬁred up for us,” he said. “I look for
a tough, close-checking, hard-
hitting game.”

Vernon, who has Ascored 16 goals
and assisted on 14 others through-
out the Panthers’ ﬁrst six games,
has been shifted still another
time—back to defense, where he
began the season. '

“We’ve discovered some good

wings,” he said, “so Russ Stumﬁfif

and I will be back together on
defense. Freshman Dave Carns,
who has been playing well for us,
and Tom Sherwin, a newcomer,
provide us with some more talent
up ‘front.”' A A
Overall, the Panthers look
talented and the team is steadily
improving, just in time for a

matchup with a tough University of ‘

Cincinnati team next weekend.
“The season ‘is’ going great,”
Vernon said, “but we-’re still not

playing up to our potential. We’
» have a few guys who work hard in ‘
' ‘practiceand slack off during the . .
' games. But we are. still gettin l,_ ,
.-better.’-’ ' ' ' ' ' ‘

  For Grapplers

Long and Winding Road    

BY JIM LEWIS

 

I

tomorrow will be-a true test for his

‘ team. On that one afternoon, Pitt

It’s like looking forward to ‘a
hanging. ' , .

The Pitt wrestling team will start
on a tough, one-week road trip in
which it will compete in seven—‘
that’s right, seven—dual meets in

will play three teams—Princeton at
1:30, Navy at 3:30, and William
and Mary at 5:30—in beautiful
downtown Annapolis, Maryland.
“Saturday’s schedule will help
us prepare-for tournaments,” he

seven days against the roughest" of explained, referring to the Eastern

competition—Navy, Princeton,

William and Mary, Maryland,
Indiana, Michigan and Illinois
State“. '

Looking at this insane schedule,

one probably would think Head Panthers

Coach Dave Adams is a masochist,
or that he is a pnime candidate for
the Funny Farm. But Adams ‘-
doesn’t think'he’s crazy. , ‘

I “The next week will prove an
awful lot,”— smiled Adams, a
noticeable _ twinkle in his eye.
“When we comeback on the 17th,-
either our players will be whipped
or.we’ll be asygood ‘as we think we
have been this season.” V 

How 'can.VAda__mslbe so enthusias-
tic over the ‘Panthers’ back-break-'

.'ingLschedule? ‘Well, there are a

couple of'_reasons.= - -- .

- A F irst,.- the :Panthers tare currently

wrated‘15th in'the' nation, according "

to ‘The “Amateur Wrestling News,
the Biblefof college wrestling. They
climbedvto that lofty position after
crushing victories over "Buffalo,
:28-_9,*and Tenessee, 21.-13. Wins
over ':the upcoming foes‘. could
improve Pitt-’s standing. i’ ,

Second, Pitt is too strong -a team
to’ fear strong competition. With
the likes, of Kevin ‘Nellis (undefeat-
ed in dual meets and third in the
"Wilkes Tournament), Rande Stot-
tlemeyer (two-time All-American),
Bob Bailey (undefeated in dual
meets), Skip Bolin ‘(an excellent
7-3 record this season)’, George
O’Korn (undefeated in dual-meets)
and Bill Bailey (an impressive 5-1
recordlon the roster, how‘c__an you
be afraid of anyone?

However, 5 — A1d‘'ar_ns'‘fadm_its’‘ , that

Wrestling League playoffs and
possibly the NCAA Championship
at the end of the season. '
And then, as if tomorrow’s
schedule weren't bad enough, the
will travel to the
University of Maryland on Sunday
to face the revengeful Terrapins.
“They’.re__ shooting for us this
year,” Adams warned. “They won
the Atlantic Coast’ Conference title
last year and came hereto play us,

, thinking they could smash us. We

'. ' "c

 

 

shut them out.”, V g . ’ _
So as you can see, Pitt faces a;ton:_-‘
of tough.teams in the- future: jan.”
Atlantic Coast champion in_ Mary-.. 
land, a Southern“ Confere_ncéi_g_
champ in William. and ‘Mary,’ a ' p _
vastly , improved and powerful 
team in Princeton _and one‘ of fthegj
best teams in the nation in Navy.7 -_i
Adams thinks the performance "of" ;'
his team will carry it to the top,"
especially at hom.e—if the students
come out for the meets, that 15.7 ‘ 
“It does make a fdifference"i’n...,',,
performance when ~. the student; .{
body is behind them,” Adams said. -—  
It is a mystery why,fan_s._do_n’t. i
go to the Field ,House for the-~
matches. Maybe they’re worried 
about witnessing a losing effort by 
the Panthers. ' I . "t 1
They shouldn’t be—Adams'isn’t-.
