MC Amendment Beaten
ote E&M Bloc

By‘ AL DONALSON ' ‘-

A bloc of engineers, mustered enough voting strength to

defeat a controversial Men’s ‘C

ouncil proposed constitutional

amendment last Wednesday afternoonfor the third time.

_ The defeated: proposal concerned‘ the prhcedure used in
electing the {at-large-Wrepresentatives of Council’. _It. would
have permitted upperclassmen from any University school

to run for 13 at-large positions‘

in Council. Under the present

system, the at~large representa-F
tives are proportionately elected
from the College, Business Ad-
ministration, and Engineering and
Mines according to enrollment.

Those who voted against "the

bill expressed fear that the Col- .

lege would control Council since
it is numerically stronger than
the other schools.- ‘
Intends to Reintroduce

No motions were made to have
the proposal on next wée'k’s
agenda, but Gene Reinbold, chair-

which introduced the proposal to
C0uncil’s floor, stated that he in-
tends to reintroduce the issue.

Council’s constitution .'sti»pu-
lates that any motion to amend
the constitution must have a

three-fourths favorable vote.
-Since there were 21 members
present last VVednesday, 16 votes
were needed to carry the motion.
«Fifteen voted for the proposal,
while ﬁve engineers , voted
against- the measure. -Danny
0’Connell, Patsy Pignolli, Tom
Tarolli, Dick Murphy, and Jack.
Connors defeated the proposal.‘
Referring to the constitutional
changes of Nov. 30, in which
E&M cabinet" was asked to send
a representative to MC, Reinbold
said he didn’t see‘ why the en-
gineers wouldn’t cooperate, be-
cause, “we gave E&M another re-
presentative.” The E&M cabinet
is the governing body of the
School of ‘Engineering and Mines.
Defeated Third Time
Since it was the third time the
amendment was“ defeated, Dick
Murphy, Eng. ’56, suggested that
Council use meeting time to con-
sider “worthwhile . p r oj e ct s”
rather than prolong discussion on
the defeated measure.

Dimitri Petro, MC president
agreed with Murphy, but ex-
plained that he had allowed the
discussion to continue last Wed-
nesday because he was _ ‘fho_ping_

Greeks Give Views 1
  On New Apartments

A By ED BACHMAN
(Editor’s Note: This is the ﬁrst in a series of opinionated polls
‘ concerning Pitt’s possession of the _Schen.7.ey Park Apartments.) '
Now that the dust has had a chance to settle on the

Schenley Park Apartment sale, Pitt students have had ‘a
chance to do‘ a little thinking on future possibilities of the L

. Greeks are suddenly faced with
many problems. "What is it going
to be like to .“rush” against a
dormitory? How can frat houses
compete against the dorm as far
‘as rental price scopes? What will
the purchase do for the long-

 warited fraternity row setup?

Individuals Asked
These questions were asked of

- individuals of most of the Pitt
1 ‘fraternities last Thursday evening.

‘ The opinions are varied.
., <That the school recognizes the

'_\ch_allenge was evident last Wed-

nesday night when Dean of Men
Theodore W. Biddle invited each
of the'18 fraternity presidents to

‘ able to frats, since out-of-towners

A ..Dimitri Petro, Col._ ’56, Delta

Irving Bloom, Col. /’56, Kappa

I Pete Glagola, Col. ’56, Phi Delta

many ﬁrst-semester freshmen from

Performance Ran
386 Times; Will
Show In Memorial‘
By ESTHER MISHELEVICH
The “Madwoman” of Chail-1
lot,” in her ﬁrst appearance on

the stage, was not really mad
at all. She. was, instead, “La

Folle de.Chaillot,” created by P

the- French playwright Jean
Giraudoux, who wrote of an
eccentric countess who found liv-
ing in a world of memory prefer-
able to the world around her.

Literally, “fo1le” means “a .wom- ‘

an who commits follies,” so the
poor V lady actually suffered in
translation. » A’

Play Argumentative
Even though ’she is misrepre-

sented by the English title, the .

countess is said to provide as much
charm in’ English as in French
and still arouses the same audience’
reaction——a storm of arguments. ,
Neither the critics nor the
audiences could quite agree
whether the play was good or
bad, but the fact that it played
,386' performances in New York

(1958-'50) proves that it was
- popular. Now, this provocative
comedy will be’ presented by

Pitt Players, Jan. 19, 20, 21, in
Stephen Foster Memorial Aud-
itorium. .

The play also seems to be con-
troversial in ‘the Cathedral even
before its ﬁrst showing. No -one is
quite'sure how to pronounce its
title. The madwoman has lived in
“Shallot,” “Shalay” and even in
“Ch . . . you—know-what-it-is.” To
settle this matter, the Madwoman
is really of “Shy—yoh,”,a quarter
in Paris. ‘

-Wears’Old Clothes

Here, this daft countess, dressed
in old clothes, she found in an
attic .trunk, outwits a group of
plotters who want to drill for oil
in the centerof her beloved Par-
isian boulevards. She; is aided in
this accomplishment by some
companions she has acquired near
a sidewalk cafe —— street-singers,
jugglers, and ragpickers.

There is another‘ novel role,
too. In almost all of the late
Giraudoux’s plays, there was at
least, one dog. In this respect,
“Madwoman of Chaillot” is‘ not,
different -- almost no _ different.

Glassy-Ey,e¢Agl__TribA_e of Illiterates

By Irv Rofhman
When a 65-year-old lady can answer questions on
Dickens faster than Dickens, it’s a real accom-~
plishment. And I will root for her on the TV, screen
or in the pages of precise, concise Time. The fact
that I couldn’t get to ﬁrst base on the sam‘e ques-
tions causes no furrows in this harried brow, for I
merely write it down as having
45 years less experience than
she. 2 ' ‘
But when the $64,000 question
features a 13-year old kid from
Brooklyn whose knowledge of .
the famel Iguana is farsuperior
to mine on the" “57,” mutt, my
unshorn locks rise‘ on end. The ‘
only consolation ‘is that I’ll be
able to_ express my vote. for
President next year, while he’ll have to wait some
eight years toshow his patriotism.’ A A _
The lad even has his father on the program to de-
cide whether he’ll goifor broke, because he’s too
young to makedecisions of his own. But although it
seems ~paradoxicAal now, the true-value of such a
ruling will soon become apparent. Legal authorities
r_ecognize the insidious movement -into which the
teen-ager has been thrust; in future life, he will not
be blamed forparticipation in such a program.
The old lady’s too far gone. A A I
Pervading Magic Window-~ ' V A .
. For, you see, the undercurrent of giveaway shows
which,—has pervaded the American mind, through the

on the screen, Americans will realize too late that
the dollar they get will be their own. Sponsors
please note, and contrariwise, please note the spon-
sor.

Everybody's Home Town *

This fantastic craze was first at its height
during World War II when a fellow by the name
of Phil Miller started guests off with a one dollar
question and permitted them to,rise to the impres-
sive $64 question. . Every once in the while there
would be caustic comments from the audience about '
someone’s home town or Brooklyn—everybody’s A
home town. No one was reminded to hint the an-
swer, but everyone did. -

Today, however, not even the audience—fine
bunch of healthy, patient, money-loving Americans

‘that they are—-can be trusted.;Contestants walk in-

to glass-enclosed booths, surrounded "by policemen
and guided by an announcer paid so well to look"
worried and happy that he does. ' '— ’
' Even the famed IBM machine has been employed
to take the place of the old question—answer script
that announcers sometimes dropped accidentaly. I-
suppose that even if today’s announcer dropped the
cards, it would ‘take such a ’man asassistant re-

ggistrar E. A. Batchelder to decipher. 

What's if-Mean?. . A . .q
So we follow the mechanical IBM machine, and
thelstereotyped emcee, and 13-year old college stu-

dents, and channel 2 or 13, drooling, if not for the ,

_money, for the hand lotion the producer sells.- The
time will come, however, when _we’ll look down,

what was uppermost in’ the

made the purchase, was the tre-

Foreign Lands Lure Teacher

English Language
Stressed; People
Hungry, Diligent
By SALLY NELSON

At the close of World War
II, Mrs. Beatrice Freedman
and her daughter boarded the
ﬁrst ship leaving the country
for the Philippine Islands.
That was just ‘the beginning
of a ten—year career of answer-
ing the call for much needed
teachers in war devastated
lands—a career which even-
tually brought her to Pitt’s
Speech Department where she is
working for her Ph.D.

Her decision to teach English in
foreign countries was an impulsive

move, but one which she will nev-
er regret, she said.

Her desire for playing a part in‘

the development of new nations
such as the Philippines and Is-
rael, and the desire for growing
with them also spurred her on. In
these countries, as well as in China
and the Middle East, Mrs. Freed-
man found that education “is the
most important area of their de-
velopment.”
Students Ideal

She said it comes as no surprise
that English is stressed more than
any other subject———it is the key to
advancement and opportunity.
“The students are any teacher’s
ideal. They are sincerely eager,
earnest, and ambitious.”

Mrs. Freedman said, “Consider-.
ing the lack of adequate facilities
in these areas, and the hardships
they have endured, their interest
is even more gratifying.”

The Philippines was 'Mrs.
Freedman’s favorite country.
She was .there immediately after
the war when the people were
“poor and hungry, but hard-
working and intelligent.” ’
‘Although, it was her responsi-
bility and duty to teach, Mrs.
Freedman feels she learned every
bit as much as her foreign stu-

TRANSIT TEACHER—-A world traveler who has taught stu-

three areas of the world, Mrs.

Beatrice Freedman is shown above as “Miss Rosberry” in Pitt
Players’ production last summer, “The Corn is Green.” Her two
principal interests are foreign aﬁairs and the theater.

Discussion To Be Aired

-She is equally impressed by Pitt
students, whom she ﬁnds “to be
serious, enthusiastic, and coopera-
tive.” Mrs. Freedman was enthus-
ed with the response to a foreign
affairs panel discussion in one of
her classes. It was tape-recorded
and will b broadcast on WJAS,
7:15 p.m. on Jan. 28, Feb. 4, and
Feb. 11.
, H_er other principal interest is
the theater. Mrs. Freedman has
participated in nearly all phases
—on stage, and behind the
scenes. This summer she ap-
peared in the Pitt Player’s pro-
duction of “The Corn Is Green.”
Mrs. Freedman said, “The thea-

dents did.

Press Publishes Three Books

Under ‘University of Pittsburgh auspices, three books,

Offered Seniors

Four Fashion Fellowships are
being offered by the Tobe—Coburn
School for Fashion Careers in
New York City to senior women.
All senior women graduating be-
fore August 31, 1956 are eligible
to apply for the fellowships, off-
ered for the year 1956-1957.

A fellowship to Tobe-Coburn
covers the full tuition of $1150.

The number of fellowships, not to
exceed four, will be determined
by the merit of candidates who
submit presentations. These fel-

lowships are offered yearly “to
encourage college graduates to
enter the fashion field.” Grad-

uates of the School may find jobs
in buying, advertising, styling,
and in magazine editorial work.

°Washington’s career in the Ohio

Valley, in George Washington in
the Ohio Valley. The book fea-
tures a facsimilie reproduction of
Washington‘s ﬁrst journal, nine
collotypes, two end paper maps of
the French-Indian Wars, and is
indexed.‘ The volume is one of a
list of books on the cultural his-
tory of Western Pennsylvania sub-
sidized by the Buhl Foundation.

The ﬁrst biography of one of
West Virginia’s outstanding lead-
ers, Stephen Benton Elkins: Amer-
ican Foursquare, was written by
Oscar D. Lambert, West Virginia
University historianand librarian.
The book traces the career of the
West Virginia cabinet member,
U.S. Senator, railroad builder, and
industrial pioneer.

The director of Heinz Choir,
Theodore M. Finney, has written
a 43 page book, titled We Have
Made Music. It is an accounting
of his stewardship of the Heinz
Chapel Choir and his philosophy
resulting from association with
Pitt students since 1939.

ter is the most important vehicle
for culture.”

“All the humanities can be
learned in the theater in fact,” she
said “it is a wise idea to combine
theater and education--educational
theater, in other words.”

Creates Comedy Format
Her interest in the theater was
shared by her late husband, David
Freedman, novelist, author
Broadway revues, and pioneer in
radio. It was he who created the
present format used by comedians
—the “family” idea of working the
entire cast into comedy bits.
Another sidelight in her life
is the method in which Mrs.
Freedman obtained her '- college
education. After her husband’s
death, she entered the Univer-
sity of California, where she
earned her BA degree in Eng-
lish and her teaching creden-
tials. *
“ Mrs. Freedman ﬁnds Pittsburgh
“an interesting and stimulating
city.” “The general, all-around
friend1iness'of Pittsburghers has
an overwhelming and very wel-
come appeal.” She said, “Pitts-
burgh is a wonderful theater town,
and an especial] good tryout town.
The people are culture minded,
and theater—goers with sophisticat-
ed reaction!’

As for future plans, Mrs.’

Freedman has none, she said.
“I don’t make plans; I live each
day as it comes.” Her life has
never been completely her own
"however. Her marriage, her
family, and her career have
claimed the major part of Mrs.
Freedman’s life.

“At the present I am quite con-
tent to remain at Pitt, to live in
this friendly city, and to be occu-
pied with my 1'avorite pastime—
teaching,” she said.

Advantagesof frat life will be
selling point over dorm life.

Jim George, Col. ’5’7, Sigma Al-
pha Epsilon—Frats have low rent
and it’s doubtful if Apartments
can meet that. Can’t see that the
dorms can make too much dif-
ference when a fraternity row
becomes a reality.

Benny Forman, Bus. Ad. ’56,
Sigma Alpha Mu—Competition to
rush men will be stiffer and flats
will have to work together more.
The dorm residents will ﬁnd
brotherhood in dorms, but they
must be convinced that a more
all-around social life is offered
them by frats.

Jim Westman, Col. ’56, Sigma
Chi-——Dorms will bring more po-
tential frat men and rent cheaper
in frats. Since more people will
be in school, fraternity row should
become a reality sooner.

- Tom McDowell, Phar. ’57, Sigma
Pi——The dorms will help to con-
solidate the students and more in-
terest will be evident in all ac-
tivities. Rent can’t be much lower
than frat houses. Frat row will do
a lot to help frats.

Phil Russo, Col. ’57, Theta Chi

—The sale will hurt frats for ﬁrst
few years, but will deﬁnitely help
after that. -Frats won“: have too
much trouble ﬁlling houses after
dorms have been here awhile.
Little difference in rent expected.

 Bureau of Research

Reports Boom Year

“As the most prosperous year in our history draws to
a close, the business boom shows few signs of slackening,”
reported the Bureau oflBusiness Research in its December

" report, issued last week.

The editor continues, “Production and the volume of
trade areholding near peak levels, employment is high, and
payrolls are the largest on record” in support of Pitt nega-
tive debaters who have been claiming during the past year

such reports to refute demands for guaranteed annual wage.

/.

The twelve page pamphlet reviews the "past year, listing

current tendencies in production, employment, ‘Trade, Ship-

" ments, Real,Estate and Construc—¢

tion, Financial Conditions, and
Prices. . ' ‘
Steel Production High

Steel production continued at
a record rate in December, the
operating rate in the country as

a whole being almost 100 percent
‘of practical capacity in the mid-
dle of the month; in Pittsburgh,

' j the national quota was excelled

by production at the rate of 102.0
per cent.

_. The Bureau attributed the la-
bor “dispute in the electrical me-

- chinery industry for a. decline
in employment in the Pittsburgh

‘ , area. Hourly earnings of ‘indus-

tries average $2.29 in November
‘ in comparison with $2.12 in No-
vember, a year earlier. How-

« _'ever, working time in district

_ industries averaged 40.9 hours
weekly in November, the low-

’ “est since August. , -

_ Gross sales in Pittsburgh de-
partment stores during December

1954. "Retail advertising’ in Pitts-

the , editor, "‘upward

causing concern.” Although busi-
ness in Pittsburgh gained during
the past year, local bank deposits
have risen only slightly.
Despite setbacks in real estate

closures, the general business ac-
tivity in the Pittsburgh area was

healthy in comparison with th

nation-wide trend.
