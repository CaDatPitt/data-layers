SGAlcohol Proposal Asks T
 For Privilege, Responsibility

(Continued from Page 1)

served by organizations which.conduct social events at which
alcoholic beverages are served; and that responsibility shall
lie with the individual organization, its ofﬁcers and members,
to see that the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania
are enforced. 4 ’
5. That the University of Pittsburgh shall incur no re-
sponsibility .for any violation of the State regulations gov-
erning the use of alcoholic beverages byiminors, in the event
that any organization should violate such regulations; pro-
vided, however, that the University of Pittsburgh shall have
the right to take whatever punitive measure it may deem
necessary against any brganization which is found" guilty of
violating such regulations.

6. That the punitive measures which may be taken
against any organization which is found guilty of violat-
ing the State law shall be directed against the organiza-
tion which is found guilty of such violation through the
Student Government of the University of Pittsburgh. A
judiciary committee will be set up by the Student Gov-
ernment Senate comprised of students, faculty, and ad-
ministration and will deal with any violations of this

‘proposal.’ _ '

7. That approval must be obtained from the Student
Government Senate by any organization wishing to have
alcoholic beverages since the Student Government is the
overall governing body of these ‘organizations. This approval

campus in recent years‘ regarding their practices in the use

G will be given on a trimester basis.

8. That this proposal and its component parts are herein
presented in View of the record of organizations on this

of alcoholic beverages: .

a. Organizations do now, as part‘ of their regular
social programs, conduct social events which include the

use of alcoholic beverages. These events, because of cur-.

rent University of Pittsburgh regulations, are generally

'held at places regarded as “oﬁ-campus.” To this date,

few, if any, incidents have occurred in which because of
the elfects of alcoholic beverages, any organization has
been the-icause of any troubleor of any violation of the
law. ’ —

HAPPINESS CAN’T BUY MONEY

Can education bring happiness?

This is a question that in recent years has caused much

lively debate and several hundred stabbings among American
college professors. Some contend that if a student’s intellect
is sufficiently aroused, happiness will automatically follow.
Others say that to concentrate on the intellect and ignore the

’ rest of theipersonality can only lead to misery.

I myself favor the second view, and I offer in evidence the
well-known case of Agathe Fusco.

Agathe, a forestry major, never got anything less than a
straight “A”, -was awarded her B.T. (Bachelor of Trees) in
only two years, her M.S.B. (Master of Sap and Bark) in—only
three, and her D.B.C. (Doctor of Blight and Cutworms) in
only four. - - —.

Academic glory was hers. Her intellect was the envy of
every intellect fan on campus. But was she happy?"The
answer, alas, was no. Agathe—she knew not why—was miser-.
able, so miserable, in fact, that one day while walking across
campus, she’ was suddenly so overcome with melancholy that
she ﬂang herself, weeping, upon the statue of the Founder.

By and by a liberal arts major named R. Twinkle Plenty came
by with his yoyo. He noted Agathe’s condition.‘ .“How come ‘
you’re so unhappy, hey?” said R. Twinkle.

“Suppose you tell’ me, you dumb old liberal arts major}!
replied'Agathe peevishly. I '

  

b. Permission to use alcoholic beverages in houses
and at social affairs of organizations wouldhave advant-
ages both to the University and to the individual or-
ganization sharingthis privilege." The privilege to use
alcoholic beverages on campus would enable, the organ-
izations to use their own facilities or University facilities.
rather than have to rent facilities at placesaff campus. It
is also,of advantage to the University to have as -many
social events as possible held on its own facilities and
under its direct jurisdiction and control.

Further Step
dc. Granting the permission to organizations to use
alcoholic beverages at social events would be a further
step in the social education of University students; that
is, an education as to the proper use of alcoholic bever-
ages at a social event. ' .

“All right, I will,” said R. Twinkle. “You are unhappy for
two reasons. First, because you have been so busy stuﬂing
your intellect that you have gone and starved your psyche. I’ ve
got nothing against learning, mind you, but a person oughtn't
to neglect the pleasant, gentle amenities of 1ife—the fun
things. Have youyfor instance, ever been to a. dance?”
Agathe shook her head.

Agathe shook her head. ‘
“Well,we’ll ﬁx that right now!” said R.Twinkle and gave her

a Marlboro and struck a match.
She puffed, and then for the

ﬁrst time in twelve or fifteen,

the winter trimester.

10. That at the end of the period for which these provi-

sions were enacted, if they are so enacted, the administration
should reconsider the provisions of this proposal, and any
amendments which may have been found necessary, and
determine whether or not the privilege to use alcoholic
beverages at the social affairs and houses of organization at
the University of Pittsburgh should be permanently granted.

two things making you unhappy?" , ,

“Oh, yeah,” said Agathe. “What's the other one?'3

“I stepped on it during a ﬁeld trip in my freshman year,’9
said Agathe. “I keep meaning to have it taken off}!

“Land sakes, what a relief!” said Agathe, now totally happy,
and took R. Twinkle’s hand and led him to 9. Marlboro vendor's
and then to a justice of the peace.

Today Agathe is a perfectly fulﬁlled woman, both intellect-
wise and personalitywise. She lives in a darling split-level
house with R. Twinkle and their 17 children, and she still keeps
busy in the forestry game. Only last month, in fact, she became

j, , The announcement that the Regional Programs Divi-
{sion has selected its ﬁrst group_ of off-campus campuses is
ta long-awaited event which is heartily welcomed. I
 The proposed two—year sub~universities at Greensburg,
Bradford and Titusville reflect an ingenious plan to deal
I ith the two major problems concerning. higher education
v ,_ day: expense and over-crowdedness. ’ ‘
, Students and their parents will ﬁnd the economic

 an appreciable degree with the proposed lower tuitions
flfor the new learning centers. In addition, about half of a
1st‘udent’s college experience can be spent in or around his
fhornetown, which saves him well over a thousand dollars
Vlfor room and board. _

 The problem of over-crowdedness is being felt at many
icolleges other than the University. As Chancellor Litchﬁeld
described it, the regional campus program will help meet
‘5“the need of Pitt. . . . for supplemental undergraduate facil-
e-Jlties to_ handle the enrollment bulge expected in school
"populations by the middle of the l960’s.

‘jeducate a larger number of students without major new
i expansion of the Oakland Campus in Pittsburgh,” he added.

"designed to have a sensible ratio of students and _teachers,
‘even though the undergraduate population is expected to"
climbrapidly within the schools’ ﬁrst few years.‘ ‘ A A

It is in the light of the size of these schools’ that one
‘lfmay ﬁnd area for concern,'however. With campuses having
-‘only. a hundred or so students, it is felt that "everything
possible should be done to create as much collegiate atmos-
phere for the beneﬁt of all concerned. '

-‘ By making the new college as mucha "‘real’.’, campus as
lzpossible, and by stressing the relationship between the reg-

dent affairs of the institutions——the adjustment to “upper-
"classmanship” can be made more easily. ,

The University’s present regional campus in Johns-
town, which is celebrating its 35th anniversary this month,
has been producing mature, activity-minded students. If
the techniques employed at_ that school for creating col-
legiate atmosphere are employed at the new schools, then
We shall gain even more full-ﬂedged, consciencious college
men and women. ’

' Dr. Rankin with its best wishes

gburden usually associated with quality education lessened ’

Next Monday evening, Student Government’s
latest Alcohol Proposal will go before the on-
campus student body for its next—to-the-last sub-
administrative ratiﬁcation, and unless something
-drastic happens to the student
alcohol palate in the next ﬁve
days, it ought to be accepted
without much hesitation; ,

And then on Thursday,‘SG
will brood over the results of the
poll for a short while and then
advance the entire proposal to

for a speedy and satisfactory ad-
ministrative answer.

The question is, however,
even if the proposal is quite ac- ' ‘ _
ceptable to the student body, what will be its re-
ception among the hierarchy of the University?

Somewhat of an indication of this questionable
reception was received last year when Dr. Rankin
returned SG’s fraternity-only alcohol proposal
complaining of the ‘‘lack of concensus” and “reser-
vations” of the fraternities for “accepting the
responsibility.’.’ - , -

Assuming that the‘ new “universal” proposal
will receive the support of fraternities and inde-
pendents‘ alike, the only rational objections con-
cerning the situation must be leveled" at the pro-
posal itself, and unfortunately for" the wets on
campus, this year’s proposal is as full of admini-
strative-type holes as last year’s.

Administration Will Never ,SwaI|owbSG

In the ﬁrst place, the administration is going to
ﬁnd it quite difficult to swallow the placing of what
amounts to University liquor control board under
the direction of the SG Senate. This is plainly an
administration controlled affair requiring the ap-
pointment of an assistant chancellor and a dozen
or so sub—ﬂunkies to tie upwhat appears to be a
relatively efﬁcient judiciary committee in -reams of
useless paper work.

Not only will the administration probably frown '

 

 
  
  
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
  

By Matt Swetonic

on the judiciary angle, but it will also probably
disfavor the sections of the proposal regarding the
extension of the drinking provision only to those
organizations recognized by SG.

Although SG seems to be doing an admirable
job this year in advancing its various programs, it
could be pointed out that in the recent past SG has
been a relatively inefﬁcient and bungling ‘organi-
zationlinto whose hands it is not quite safe to place
the power for selecting which organizations will be
allowed to drink on campus. ' _

What this amounts to, in‘ essence, is that it is

‘ very doubtful whether the administration is going

to be willing to subjugate itselfin such an import-
ant‘ realm to the direction of any student body.
Bribe ls Too.Obvious _

It is also rather doubtful whether’ the University
is going to buy the obvious bribe which SG is
throwing in the administration’s face in section
eight ofithe proposal. _ < '

It -is in this section that SG is ﬂaunting the
campus temperance record for all to see with the
added inducement of certain “advantages” to be
gained by the admission of beer to the campus.

However, it is rather difficult to believe that any
appreciable “social education” will be brought
about by shifting the place of the affair from Gus-
tine’s to the third ﬂoor” offices of some SG recog-
nized organization. ,

In this respect the-fraternities cannot even ‘be
considered for the proposal states that their off-
campus affairs have been quite respectable up to
this point, and it is not rational to believe that
bringing them on campus would further educate
the brothers in alcoholic etiquette. " .

Therefore, the’ only’ probable conclusion which

can be drawn from the proposal as presented to the '

student body is that the administration will l_ﬁn_d ' ‘

enough little things wrong with it to render. it.

unacceptable, and even if‘ it is accepted, it will be
under restrictive conditions which SG most ‘cer-
tainly did not forsee when it ﬁrst decided to try
and bring legal liquor to the University. '

Stand on Editorial
Editor, The Pitt‘ News A .

On Wednesday, October 10th,
an editbrial was printed in the

’Pitt News which leveled rather ,

serious charges of racial dis-

crimination against the students,

faculty, and administration of this
University. As. elected representa-
tives of the student ,body, we are
vitally concerned with University
problems and policies.
,_ If problems do exist, it is es-
sential that they be discovered,
pointed out, and resolved. How.-
ever, exaggeration and distortion
serve" no useful function in this
necessary endeavor. Indeed they
can irreparable harm and cast
harsh, totally unjustifiable re-
ﬂections upon the entire Univer-
sity community.

In the ﬁrst place it should be
noted and every student should
be aware that the matter of rac-

_ial discrimination has received

considerable attention "at this
University. The University oper-
ates under a policy which does
not condone discrimination in
any manner, andin any aspect of
University life. _
In the past, situations and oc-
currences which seemed to sug-
gest that this policy is hypocritical
have been investigated. Such
charges have been found to be
either attribut_able to the personal

feelings and prejudices of indivi—.

duals within the University com-
munity and not to the Univer-
sity’s policies, or groundless, the
regrettable result ofa misunder-
standing or a fallacious report.

The ﬁrsttwo instances cited in
the editorial inquestion illustrate

the point concerning» individual

is Bali! is

    

sity can control and perform it’s
oiﬁcial administrative functions
within the context of a ﬁrm" anti-
discrimation policy, but no ad'-
ministration can control the feel-
ings of each individual under it’s
jurisdiction. s _. '
Prejudices are learned and the

We can only hope that by the

The implications involved in the

presentation of the incident con-

cerning the “African” and the

“white girl” are much more ser-

ious. Therefore, we felt that an
attempt should be made to dis-
cover the true facts of the situa-

As a result of looking’ into the

The question is: IF SOCRATES WERE ALIVE TODAY, WHAT WOULD HE ADVISE
SMOKERS? Good, smart advice. Of course it makes sense to enjoy the fine-,
tobacco taste of Lucky Strike. This taste is the best reason to start with Luckies 
. . . the big reason Lucky smokers stay Lucky smokers. And this same taste is    ..   
what makes Lucky Strike the favorite regular cigarette of college students.

TO EACH HIS OWN

Before West Virginia beat Pitt a lot of Cynics /questioned

the value of the Mountaineer’s undefeated record, saying '

they hadn’t played anybody yet.

After they beat Pitt _a super-cynic could say the same
thing, but one reporter asked Coach Gene Corum about his
schedule. “All I know is that they’re rough enough for us,”
Corum replied.

“Next week we play George Washington at Morgantown
and it will be Homecoming. Too us, that’ll be a tough game.”

’ =l< =l= * =l=

.u.

“Ricky Leeson makes me nervous every time he
carries the ball,” said Coach Gene Corum. . . . Mickey
Furfari, ‘a West Virginia sportswriter, said, “That Leeson
sure is one helluva football player-. . . . Harold Rosenthal
of the Journal-American said, “Leeson’s the best fullback
I’ve'seen in the East.”

*

A good share of the Mountaineers were talking in admir-
ation about Paul Martha in the showers following their win.
Corum singled him out as “the biggest single weapon on the
team.” Martha has caught six passes so far for two touch-

1 yards a catch.
=l= =t= =l<

* * *

A Green Bay scout who watched the game, looking for
future lineman for the pro champions, said, “(Gary) Kalten.-
bach is too lazy.” The Panther tackle was credited with a
tackle assist against West Virginia.

* =l< =11 =l<
“I never saw Coach Michelosen more charged-up be-
fore a game,” one of his players conﬁded. “He really
wanted to beat them. I guess this doesn’t help his posi-

tion around here any.”

* * =l¢ rt:

The most under—rated ball—player on Pitt’s team is End
Al Grlgaliunas. Al has caught ﬁve passes this year for 69
yards and a touchdown and no one puts out more.

=‘l= '* * *

A San Francisco newspaper story concerning the
play in which California quarterback Randy Gold was
put out of action for the season with an injured knee.
“He was purnmeledunrnercifully by a tackle named
Sorochak.”

The villain in question was Bob .Sorochak. He was in
Baylor’s and Cal’s backﬁelds all day. Against the Moun-
taineers, he hit a back for a seven—yard loss the ﬁrst time
he got in during the third quarter. *

He made seven tackles in thelast half. When the ball is
snapped, he moves from his middle guard spot straight in,
never wavering or never goingaround anyone.

—With more boys like him the Panthers mi
UCLA. It sounds silly, but we think they will.

The soccer‘team will meet its
roughest competition of the sea-
son in Howard University, last
year’s NAIA champions. The game
will be played Saturday morning
at 10:30 at Kennard Field.

» Howard will have several start-
ing members ‘of last year’s team
back this year. Among them will
be Aloysius Charles, who was in-
strumental in last year’s 4-1 vic-
tory over Pitt.

Both teams have met only one
common opponent, F r o s tb u r g
State. Both teams beat Frostburg
2-0.

Scorers Back

Alexis, who scored two goals
against Pitt last year, will also be
back to menace the varsity boot-

ers. He has already scored nine
goals in his ﬂrst three games.
Howard has showed some excel-
lent scoring potential, as they de-
feated'Fairley Dickinson 5»-1.

Host Howard Saturday

The Washingtonians have a
wealth of material to draw
from, as they have members on
the roster from many lands, in-
cluding Africa and India.

The Panthers will be forced to
play without their inside left this
week. Bruno Schwarz is out with
an ankle injury. Coach Leo Bemis
says that the team will not be

weakened, however, as Jerry
Yospin is a capable replacement
for Schwarz.

Bemis said, “Beating Howard, I
think, can be a big factor in our
success this season.”

. Bemis added that Howard will
be the toughest opponent Pitt has
played thus far.

Panthers Host UCLA in Must
Game At Stadium Saturday

Bruins Hold Win
iOver Ohio State

By BOB SMIZIK
The Panther football team,

down but not yet out, faces

perhaps its most important.

game of the season Saturday
at the Stadium when they
meet the nationally ranked

iUClA Bruins at 1:30 p.m.

Every season has its turning
point and this game seems to be
it for the Panthers. A win could
give the team the momentum nec-
essary for a winning year while
a loss could do the exact opposite.

UCLA will be nc pushover.
They were ranked in the top

ten last week and are certain to

be there again this week. The rat-
ing is due mainly to a 9-7 win
over powerhouse Ohio State. Last
week the Bruins trounced Colo-
rado State 35-7.
Use T—Formation »

The year UCLA has switched
away from the single-wing attack,
which they used for many years,

.to the more conventional T-for-

mation.

Using a single-wing last year
the Bruins found the Panthers
easy prey, winning 20-6.. The
win gave UCLA a tie in the all-
time series at 2-2.

The Panthers may be bolstered
in their bid to seek revenge for
last year’s loss by the possible
return to action of quarterback
Fred Mazurek.

Chances are that both Ed
Adamchik and John Jenkins will
return to the lineup, in addition
to Mazurek, which means the
Panthers will be at full strength
for the contest.

GENERAL EDUCATION require-
ments at Mount Holyoke College,

“Give us a brake," Ford Motor Company engineers were told, “that
will automatically compensate for lining wear whenever an adjustment
is needed—-and make it work for‘ the entire life of the lining.”

Tough assignment—but not insurmountable. Today, not only does
every Ford-built car boast self—adjusting brakes,_ but the design is so
excellent that adjustments can be made more precisely than by hand.

This Ford-pioneered concept is not complex. Key to it is a simple
mechanism which automatically maintains proper clearance between
brake drum and lining.

It's now a fact: every Ford-built: car in 6'63 has self-adiusting brakes
