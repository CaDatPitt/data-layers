Vandalism
At Hillmdn

By TERESA SOKOL
Pitt News Staff Writer

Students using the Hillman
library group-study rooms may be
faced with the loss of this option if
vandalism to these rooms does not
stop, according to __Robert
Neumann, assistant director of the
university libraries.

Because of repeated damages to
the nine second-floor group-study
rooms, Neumann said that ' the
Director of Libraries, Glenora
Rossell, has indicated that Hillman
Library -may be forced to lock the
doors of these study rooms in_the
evenings to avoid further van-
dalism. .

Neumann‘ said the library

“repeated damage” of the study
rooms to the attention of admin-
istrators a few weeks ago.

Although Neumann said there.

Neumann added that the damage

The board voted to reject the
constitution, and Bertocchi propos-
ed three amendments: to delete the
provision for staff advisers on the
board, to increase the number of
members-selected from and by the
PUPC to three, and to remove the
advisers from the ‘selection commit-
tee for chairperson. The last
amendment would increase Board
of Governors membership on this

' committee from one to three._

The board voted 5-2 in favor of
accepting these amendments.

Abraham then made a motion to re- '

ject the budget.‘ _
“I think we’re playing games
with this organization,” Abraham

said. Abraham told each member "

to make it his responsibility to go to
the PUPC and discuss the proposed
constitution. The board voted 6-1
in favor of rejecting the budget and
sending it back to PUPC.

In other business, Legal
Awareness Committee (LAC)
liaison A1 Mele announced that an
ad hoc committee had chosen Dave
Crissman as the new chairman of
the LAC. Former LAC chairman
Mary Curiale stated that she be-

News Analysis
Iran

By CINDY COHEN

The Iran Plan. President Carter
has given a signa1,“"loud and clear,

to the Iranian militants who are V

holding the hostages and to the
government of Iran itself.

Carter’s four-part proposal in-
cludes: 1) increased economic sanc-
tions, 2) severing of diplomatic rela-
tions, 3) the freezing of all Iranian
assets in the United States, and 4)
the suspension of the visas process-

..:,:d for immigrating Iranians, except

[for health and ' humanitarian

’ reasons.

Several of the diplomats who
were expelled asked for visas to re-
main in the United States. Some
said they wanted to" continue
various medical treatments, and at

least one asked to be granted.
' political asylum. All the requests

were denied.

What we are left with is a move
that really has no substantive
response as of now. The
Ayatollah’s response was that this
move was a “good omen.” Foreign
Minister Gobzadeh said it would
notchange their position on the

hostages, and President Bani-Sadr
said some conservation . moves
might be necessary. This would ap-
pear to be a far cry from ac-
quiesence. '

Our allies were not consulted
prior to the embargo, but were ask-
ed to join in ex post facto. As of
now, they have met to engage in a
dialogue on the situation and their
only statement has been to ask the

Iranian government for a definite »

Reagan Retracts Statement on GI Bill During City Stop

By The Associated Press
Ronald Reagan, saying he got
had information from top military
officials, retracted on Thursday a
statement about the ' GI ‘Education
Bill. But he defended the accuracy
of other campaign assertions.
Reagan, who said Wednesday
night that Vietnam veterans were
not entitled to GI Bill education
beneﬁts because the United States
never declared war in the Southeast
Asian conflict, said upon his arrival
in Pittsburgh yesterday, “That was

not quite correct.” The former
California governor blamed his
mistake on information from a re-
cent briefing by two “gentlemen
who only recently wore four stars
each from two branches of the ser-
vices...

“Both of these gentlemen in-
dicated they (Vietnam veterans)
were notvgetting the GI bill and I in
good faith took their word and
stated that,” Reagan said.

He refused to identify the of-
ﬁcers, but other sources identiﬁed

Chiefs of Staff, and retired Maj.
Gen. Edward Rowney, a former
Pentagon liason to the strategic
arms talks between the United
States and the soviet Union. A

Neither Moorer nor
could be reached for comment
Thursday. .

It was not the first time in his
campaign that Reagan has seen the
accuracy of his speeches ques-2
tioned. His campaign statements

are often filled with facts and
figures. In the past, Reagan has
claimed there are more oil reserves
in Alaska than in Saudi Arabia. He
has not repeated that assertion on
the current campaign swing through
Texas, where he is seeking votes in
the April 22 Republican presidential
primary election.

Asked about a CBS-TV program
which challenged other campaign
statements, Reagan said he was
aware of the program and felt

“they were doing exactly what they
accused me of doing, that they wear;
out and found some source that
would give them a different answer
and they then took that source as an
absolute guarantee.

“They went forward with their
figures and I had to laugh at some

i‘ of them,” Reagan told a news con-

ference at the Greater Pittsburgh
Airport on his arrival in the steel-
producing city.

billion tax cut over the next three
years if he is elected, Bush said.

“That kind of phony promise
cannot prevail,” Bush said.

Instead, Bush said that he ad-
vocates “supply-side economics”
where tax cuts are investment-
oriented in order to stimulate sav-
ings by consumers. «

Also, excessive government

‘regulation should be curtailed as

well as government spending, ac-
cording to Bush.

“There’s going to have to be
some tightening-up,” Bush said.

In order to “tighten-up” federal
budget, waste in federal programs
like welfare must be eliminated,
Bush said.

. “There is no way you’re going to
curtail some spending without some
hurt,
board,” Bush said.

some sacrifice across the '

on draft registration and the draft
in general.

Bush said he supports both all-_
volunteer army and mandatory
draft registration because he is
“concerned about the shortfall” in
U.S. military strength.

Instead of waiting for an interna-
tional crisis to support mandatory
registration, Bush said Carter
should have supported legislation
before Congress last year calling for
resumption of registration.

Bush said the need for mandatory
registration is “a question of an an-
tiquated selective service machinery
brought up to date.”

As a supporter of the Equal
Rights Amendment,
said, he believes that women as well
as men should be included in the
draft. '

Bush stressed his expertise—in the
energy field and offered his views
concerning the energy problem fac-

Bush.

, ing the United States.

One key to solving the energy
crunch, according to Bush, is to
keep government “out of it.” For
example, Bush cited the windfall

. profits tax, which heopposes as an

unneeded government regulation
because the legislation does not pro-
vide a reinvestment provision for oil
exploitation.

Development of alternative
energy sources and strict conserva-
tion is also a necessary part of a
federal energy policy, Bush added.

However, when it comes to student
activities it is the students /who
should control the outside interests
they choose.

If the director of student ac-
tivities, Andy Smith, has his way,
we as students‘ are going to lose
much more control over what we

choose to do. As a CGS student, I
would not want to see my elected

autonomy. Nor would I want to see
any of the student media (WPGH,

of editors appointed by the
administration, rather than
qualified ‘people chosen bytheir
peers. Aside from-the added loss of
student's, , autonomy to the vice

chancellor for student affairs and

the director of student activities,
recommendations of additional
control for these people are being
considered. -One such recommen-
dation ‘is the‘ proposal of an‘-

jeopardy of losing some of their

division, only an associate member.
The Panthers finished 9-21 and
looked eagerly to this season":

This year, the Pitt volleyballers
entered Division II conference as a
full-fledged. member, under the in-
struction of head coach Ray Reilly
and his assistant Mike Hebert. The
young squad opened up the season
optimistically and began winning
matches. And winning more mat-

ches. Now, in one short year, the

Panthers have clinched the Division-
II conference top honors and an-
automatic berth into ‘the Eastern
Collegiate Volleyball League
playoffs to be held at Princeton
next weekend.

Coming off a division clinching
performance at George Mason
University, the Panthers look to
‘Princeton tomorrow afternoon and
hopes of keeping, an undefeated
record in converence play. If the
Panthers ‘win tomorrow, an 8-0
record will be theirs, as they go into
their first ECVL playoffs, in only
their second season. A

“Even though we’ve clinched the
conference title, we are still fighting \
to build a lot of credibility for the
men’s team in the East and at Pitt,”
said Hebert. “We want to say that
we ‘were able to finish our first

. season in Division II undefeated.”

The Panthers put in a tough per-
formance against George Mason,
and will look ‘to do the same against
Princeton, although a loss would

not change the outcome of entry in-

to ECVL’s.

“At George Mason we played a
very inspired match,” said Hebert.
“We had thoroughly scouted
George . Mason, and the~ specific’

   Spikers Host Princeton in Season's_FlnaI 

blocking assignments that we had

worked on prior to the match were

executed successfully.’ ’

The Panthers will most likely.

receive a fourth place seed in next
week’s ECVL’s, behind threetough
Division I schools. Three Division I
teams automatically receive the first
three seeds, and then the Division II
schools are inserted. Seeds should
go as follows; 1) Rutgers-Newark,
2) Penn State, 3) Army, 4) Pitt. The

possibility of Division I’s, East _

Stroudsburg being seeded before
the Panthers is present, but will re-
main to be seen until official
seedings are released next week.

The Panthers must first concen-
trate on the Princeton match and
the conclusion of regular season

play before the second, season‘

opens up next week.
I

“We have had such a good
season that the team’s momemtum
and spirits are very high,” said
Hebert. “So even though the con-
ference title is clinched, they will

still be ready to defeat Princeton.” I

Pitt has been playing without the
services of hitter Danny O’Donnell
due to a bone chip in his ankle.
O’Donnells chances of returning to
the lineup for any of the remaining

. matches are slim. Inserted into the
lineup in O’Donnell’s place is Scott
Robbins. Robbins had been a setter

last season and sometimes this year

when the Panthers played a 6-2 of- '
fense, sharing the position with

starting setter Dave Baird. The
Panthers have been playing much
more of a 5-1 offense with Baird the
only setter, so Robbins will be hit-
ting, switching positions for the rest
of the season.

Next year when the Panthers are

once again reviewing their,

accomplishments, they want to look
back at this season and find their
record an undefeated one.

“We are having tough practices
all this week,” said Jeff Beavers.
“We are all working hard because
we all want that 8-0 record, we want
our conference season to be
unblemished.”

    Swimmerifsandy Pidgeon Goesgtlf-'rom   Rags to Riches’  

By STEVE THOMAS

_ _ Pitt News Staff Writer

- “From Rags To Riches,” is a
popular phrase" in our society that
‘the majority of us, if asked, would
probably relate to a classic film, or
story of a successful entrepreneur

 who started his rise to prominence
 from the inner depths of poverty.

This common cliche, however,

can’ also be applied to Sandy-

Pidgeon of the men's swimming

‘. team, who like many athletes, lacks

" swimmers are,” said Pidgeon.

in physical size but not in natural
talent and heart. Head swimming

coach Fred Lewis calls Pidgeon a.

“workaholic” because he insists on
laboring so many long hours at
Trees Pool.

“I have to work hard, because
I’m not very big like most national
(II
look up to Brian Goodell of UCLA,

‘who’s one of the best. He was an

underdog like me, but he made it
real big anyway. My favorite quote

is from him.”

That particular quote Pidgeon

 I refers to sounds something like this:

“It’s not the sizeof the dog in the
fight, but the size of the fight in the

' dog.”

 

 
 

Since age six, Pidgeon has been
ﬁghting pool waves like a dog, com-
peting “against bigger swimmers,
always being at a disadvantage. Up
until age ten, he was a member of
the Greater Pittsburgh Swim Club.
What used to be a world-ranked
club, dissolved, prior to his arrival,
and to make matters worse, the

Awcoach resigned. He continued .to

swim, though, and commuted in
and out of private clubs in the
meantime.

I At Kiski Prep" School, Pidgeon
played a major role in the school’s_

- unbeaten streak of 34 dual meets.

 

I It was ironic, then, that when
" Pidgeon entered Pitt as a walk-on

and made the team, he would be

‘part’ of another long winning

 

fstreak——this one 28 dual meet vic-
tories without a loss. '

Several thingslured Pidgeon to
Pitt. For one, he wanted a college

was anxious to get away. Then, he
wasfinformed that Pitt had a great
swimming coach named Fred
Lewis, and a really good swimming
program on top of.that.

Pidgeon performed well enough
his first year to receive a scholar-
ship, and out several seconds off his

.- previous best times, which helped

him gain respect as well as improve
considerably in rapid fashion.

“Being on a team“ with world-
ranked swimmers like Stu Swanson
and Rick "Carter helped me push
myself to do better,” said Pidgeon.

As a sophomore, Pidgeo\n began
to make ends meet.

“Making it to nationals last sum-
mer was the highpoint of my
career,” said Pidgeon. “It was ‘the
first summer I trained under Fred
Lewis. I practiced six hours a day,
and it really helped me to progress
and perform as well as I have.”

Pidgeon went on to 5 win the
200-meter breaststroke at Easterns,
and placed very high at the NCAA

Championships.

“I’ve always wanted to swim with
the best in the world,” said

‘Pidgeon. “Nobody ever thought I

could do it because of my size.”
Pidgeon anxiously awaits next"

year when the Panthers face three

top ten teams. Scheduled to battle

Pitt for top honors are: Tennessee, V

the 1978 NCAA Champions; In-
diana (Bloomington), four-time
NCAA Champions; and North
Carolina State, Southeastern con-
ference powerhouse.

.___‘fWe have, right now in our

_grasp, the potential for a national
powerhouse swim team,” said
Pidgeon. “If we get more support
from the Athletic Department and

- the Golden Panthers, and if more ‘

people attend our meets, we can do
it. -
“Adding Tennessee, N.C. State,
and Indiana to our schedule is
great,” he added, “because we can
start winning against national class
powers. I really wish the athletic
director and Golden Panthers
would get behind us and support us

swimming facilities like us. ‘I can’t

understand why they're not behind»

us. -

“We have a great coach in Fred
Lewis, who has taken -myself, for
example, from state class swimmer

- 7. -my / .-

A Lachowicz and the rest of th

to national class swimmer,”‘
Pidgeon said. “Hopefully to world
class swimmer. We also have the
swimmers who are willing to work
out hard for five hours a day. All

we need is some more backing, and mination.
