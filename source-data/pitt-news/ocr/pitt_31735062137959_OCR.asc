Outstanding Grid Tilt On
Nation’s Schedule

Winner May Get Title

By Charles A. Rush

Act Two of a sensational three-act
drama entitled “Bringing The National
Football Bacon to Pittsburgh” will
send the customers scurrying back to
their seats in the stadium tomorrow
in time for the kickoff at 2 o'clock. A
glance at the program reveals that the
plot will deal with “Pitt versus Minne-
sota.”

Director Sutherland of the Panthers
has been holding late practices all this
week in order to get his cast and un-
derstudies into tip top shape for their
big test. Director Bierman of the
Gophers, who was among those wit-
nessing the Pitts in their last weeks
performance against the thundering
Trojans who failed to thunder. is
bringing to town with him an all-star
cast for the fray.

On the basis of what has gone be-
fore, it can only be said that the Pitt
team has spoken its piece passing well

Non—Fraternity Man Holds Post'
For First Time In Years

Dale Van Ormer, C37, was named
the ﬁrst non-fraternity p-resident of
Druids in modern history at a dinner
meeting Tuesday in the Ruskin apart-
ments.

Fred Edwards, BA37, former presi-
dent of Druids, was forced to tender
his resignation as an officer of the or-
ganization by the men’s point scale
committee Monday. Although the
constitution of Druids states that in
the a.bsence——either temporary or
permanent—of the president, the vice
president shall assume that office, the:
vacancy was ﬁlled at that time by
the appointment of Gordon Rauck,
C37, as temporary chairman.

No explanation as to the failure of
Van Ormer to take office at that time
was made.

After some discussion on the inter-
pretation of the clause in the consti-
tution providing for the ascension of
the vice president to the presidency,
Van Ormer was acknowledged presi-
dent at the dinner meeting. Several
amendments are now under consid-
eration as to the method of ﬁlling the
present vacancy in the vice presi-
dency. »

The initiation of Raymond Scheib,
William Bolitho, Robert Landau, and
Edgar Spitz on Sunday will provide
four new eligibles for the position of
vice president.

University Seismograph
Fails To Record Quake

Although the United News reported
a violent earthquake in Denisli, which
is in the Smyrna region of Turkey,
the University's seismograph, one of
the most sensitive in the country,
recorded no vibrations. Homer M.
Rutherford, graduate assistant in
geology and head of the seismographic
station, said that there were many
possible reasons for this.

The machine was not in operation
Tuesday for a short while, and the
vibrations might have come in at that
time. “It might have occurred while
the paper on which the daily vibra-
tions are recorded was changed," ex-
plained Mr. Rutherford, “as this hap-
pened while earthquake vibrations
from the Japan earthquake came in.
Thouglrthe quake caused the destruc-
tion of property and endangered lives,
still it might not have been powerful
enough to send tremors all the way
around the world.

Teachers Hear Williams

Dr. Samuel H, Williams, professor
of zoology, will address the tenth an-
nual meeting of the Northwestern sec-
tion of the Pennsylania State Educa-
lion association this afternoon, in Oil
City, Dr. Williams will speak on,
:‘Biological studies in South Amer-
1ca.”

"Beware Of Celebrations,’

orable mention was

Edouard Vuillard (France).

_ received by the following artists: Salvador Dali
[(_Spa.1n), Alexandre Deineka (U.S.S.R.), Franz Lcnk (Germany),
The Allegheny County Gardenclub

er, Andre Derain.

Peter Binnie was born in Russia
and educated in the United States.
He studied art at a number of schools,
but refused to allow his own highly
individual style to be affected by any
force other than his own feelings. His
first one-man show was presented in
New York in 1930. In 1932 he was
awarded a Guggenheim fellowship.
Paintings by Blume were hung in the
Century of Progress Art exhibit both
in 1933 and 1934.

It is diflicult to classify the work of
Peter Blume and to name an artistic
movement which he follows. Per-
haps his freedom from established
styles of painting constitutes partof
his strength. His work is strongly
masculine; his technique competent
and painstaking; his design is archi-
tectural. This competency in pre-
sentation, however, is companion to
strongly original social and aesthetic,
ideas, presented with boldness and‘
brilliance. Here is an artist who is
willing to stand on his own feet, not
weak ones of other modern-
ists.

Blume’s prize - winning picture,|
“South of Scranton,” reﬂects the care-j
fulness of composition yoked to force-
fulness of idea. “South of Scranton”
deals unhesitatingly with the organi-
zation of modern society. An oﬂicial
opinion of what the artist wants to
say cannot be had. Wisely the Car-
negie Institute officials suggest that
the explanation be left to the indi-
vidual who looks at the paintings.
The judges, who have all left Pitts-l
burgh, no doubt would concur in this
opinion. Realizing the difficulty of
properly expressing pictorial sugges-
tions in the guise of words, the Pitt
News, however, wishes to suggest and
comment on those qualities in “South
of Scranton” which point out Blume’s
individuality, In this one painting he
has endeavored to portray the essen-

Carlson Warns Students

“Beware of celebrations” said Dr.
H_ Clifford Carlson yesterday in re-
gard to the student hea1th'situation.
“Football games are not so bad, but
a number of students have contracted
sore throats and colds, from their
ride through the wilds of Pittsburgh
Monday in celebration of the Southern .
Cal contest. Students
precautions that these do not develop
into anything more serious.”

Dr. Carlson requested that all fresh-,
men, who have not yet done so, get
in touch with the Student Health serv-
ice, and secure appointments for their «
medical examination.

Dr. Clothier Visits Here

Dr Robert Clothier, president of
Rutgers university, and Mrs. -Clothier
were in Pittsburgh on Wednesday en
route to Chicago. Dr. Clothier was
dean of men at the University until
1932 when he was called to the presi-
dency of the eastern school.

He stopped in Room 801, Cathedral to
congratulate Dr. ‘Vincent VV. Lanfear,
his successor as dean of men. In
speaking to students, Dr_ Clothier said
that his only regret was that he could
not stay to witness the defeat that
Pitt was going to inflict on Minnesota
tomorrow.

CPSF, Council
Of Fraternity
Archons, Born

Unanimous consent was registered
at a meeting of presidents of campus
social. fraternities. Tuesday night
when it was suggested that the office
of the dean of men be asked to ap-
point officers for a new organization
to take the place of the extinct In-
terfraternity council.

Twelve fraternities were represent-
ed at the meeting, but the remaining
social group on campus, not repre-
sented, advised the Pitt News that
the action of the other delegates met
with its approval also.

The new body—tl1e Council of Pres-
idents of Social Fraternities—will as-
sume much the same purposes and
duties previously associated with old
lnterfraternity council. l'nterfrater-
nity council was unceremoniously dis-
banded last May by recommendation
of the faculty fraternity committee.
Dissension at that time between two
-political factions within the group
over election of oflicers for this year
had reduced the unit to grab-bag
politics.

Soon after the abandonment of the
old council, a committee working
through the oﬁice of the dean of men
"set to work on rebuilding a successor.
At present, the CPSF seems to have
reached the stage where it might
work out as a reliable body, accord-
ing to N. Robert Seidle, assistant to
the dean of men and adviser of the
new group. ,

The men who will serve as oflicers
‘for the CPSF, either temporarily or
for the entire year, will be named in
‘time for release in Monday’s Pitt
News, it was revealed by Mr. Seidle.

Fine Arts Professor

Walter H, Hovey, professor and act-
ing head of the ﬁne arts department,

zation, tomorrow, afternoon in the
vWil1iam Penn hotel. Mr. Hovey was
asked to give an introductory lecture

should take; to the general study of art which the’

Delphians will carry on this year.

Mr. Hovey said he would reply to
the question, asked by the group, of
how to look at pictures, “The best
way to look at pictures is just to look
at them.”

ODK To Employ
Point Scale Plan
In Tappee Rating

Activities Group To Offer Prize
To One Outstanding Senior;
Devising Honor System

Prospective tappees of Omicron
Delta Kappa, honorary all-activities
fraternity, will henceforth be rated
according to a point scale, the pro-
gram committee of-the organization
announced Tuesday,

The innovation in selection of new
members, presented at the ﬁrst meet-
ing of the circle this semester, was
part of an 11-point schedule planned
for 1934-35.

Also featured in the projects was
the suggestion of an ODK prize to the
outstanding senior, rep-lacing the for-
mer University award. The idea was
ﬁrst broached last year, but was
shelved.

Sponsorship by the fraternity of a
University honor society council and
plans for cooperation with the Stu-
dent-Faculty association were other
points in the program_ Among the
plans are those of a classroom honor
system, class organization, a senior
high school week, and a student speak-
ing tour of high school assemblies.

According to the committee report,
a nominations group will be selected
'to investigate qualiﬁcations of possi-

ble members, a publicity organization
will be formed, a social calendar for
the season is to be drawn up, and
l preparations will be made for the an-
znual Founder's day banquet on De-
cember 3. ‘

l Another committee will be named to
uselect four honorary tappees in addi-
‘tion to the undergraduates chosen at
the Fall ceremonies.

‘» The circle has offered its services
to the University as a permanent wel-
coming committee, and will cooper-
ate with the General Alumni associa-
tion in arranging a homecoming af
fair.

George A. Roll, Ed35, president of
the group, has announced that com-
mittee action will be prompt this
year. Men selected report at the sub-
sequent meeting or are replaced. The
next bi-weekly session of the organi-
zation will take place on Tuesday,
October 30.

Drawing up the program was a
group consisting of Jules L_ Green,
C35, chairman, N. Robert Seidle, as-
sistant to the dean of men, and How-
ard Harpster, C35.

Senator Scored
in Forum Speech

Political Reporter Discussesl
Campaign At Inquiry

Denouncing David A. Reed, Repub-
lic-an senator, as having “represented
the Mellon interests ever since he has
been in Vvashington,” E. W. Prender-
gast. political reporter for the Pitts-
burgh Sun-Telegraph, described the
major political candidates and cam-
to the Inquiry forum
Wednesday.

“Reed has always represented the‘
interests of the large corporations,”
Prendergast said. “VVhen Congress
made an attempt to tax the public
utilities, Reed changed the bill so that
it taxed the consumers of the utilities
instead.”

In regard to Reed’s Democratic op-

ponent, Joseph Guffey, Prendergast
said:
‘Guffey first entered the political

foreground when "he ran for governor
in 1918 and was defeated by a nar-
row margin. He is a good politician,
astute and as deﬁnitely a career man
as the Mayo Brothers.”

In regard to the opposing candi-
dates for governor. Prendergast
stated:

“The Republicans say Bill Schnader
is the logical man for governor. He
is a corporation lawyer, avery bril-
liant fellow. He is one of two law-
yers who has turned down an offer of
a judgeship on the State Supreme
court bench. It is hard to tell wheth-
or his experience as corporation law-
yer will influence his public actions.

“George Earle, the Democratic can-
didate, is the result of a political ac-
tion. He was inspired by the policies
of President Roosevelt in the last
election and contributed $25,000 to
the campaign fund. VVhen the Demo-
crats came to power, he was offered
an ambassadorship.”

Commenting on Judge Ralph H.
Smith, Pre-ndergast said:

“The Republicans are knocking him
for deserting their ranks for the Dem-
ocratic party. Smith, however, can
take it, and politicians should be able
to.”

Sigma Delta Chi
Opens Map Sale

Illuminated Chart Of Campus
Drawn By Cy Hungerford

   

The illuminated map of the campus,
introduced last year by Sigma Delta
Chi, professional journalism frater-
nity, will be on sale today at a new
reduced price, ten cents, it was an-
nounced by the chapter oﬁicials yes-
terday.

The map, drawn by Cy Hungerford,
nationally known cartoonist, is the
only one of its kind. Formerly sell-
ing at a higher price, the map, being
part of the journalistic program of
the fraternity, has been reduced to a
non-proﬁt basis.

Every shrub and sidewalk on the
campus is cleverly depicted on this
blue and gold colored chart, which is
recommended as a memento or room
decoration_

tia.l industrial organization in the coal
ﬁelds. On the tower at the right of
the painting the artist has represent-
ed different types of social control:
the militaristic force over and above
all things, the propaganda, the obser-
vation. On the left is to be --‘seen the
activity of the coal ﬁelds. In the cen-
ter, the main street of a town. And
in the foreground, near the lowest
platform of the tower, conventional-
ized men are jumping through the air,
defying all laws of gravity.

Recogiiizable, beyond doubt, is the
representation, however conv‘ential-

ized and distorted it may be. Per-
haps there is a lack of clarity, due
perhaps to the complexity of the prob-
lem with which Blume has grappled
sincerely. His gain, however, over
earlier work in presentation and in
idea is evident. In “South of Scran-
ton” the tendency which showed it-
self in “Parade” (1930) to slight
broad masses of composition and con-
centrate on detail has disappeared.

Karl Hofer won second prize for
his painting “Pastoral.” Hofer, a
German artist living in Switzerland,
is internationally known for his color
and his ability to compose. He has
been under the inﬂuence of de Cha-
vannes, primitives, Cezanne, Picasso,
Derain, but since the war his style
has matured into a. style, severe and
thoughtful, of his own. Sidney Lauf-
man, whose “Spring Landscape” won
him third prize, is interested in the
portraying of landscapes, which he
represents with simplicity, drama, and -
unusual technical skill. Laufman has‘
recently returned to his native Amer-
ica after ten years in France.

Many styles and points of view are
represented among paintings which
received honorable mention. Edouard
Vuillard, of Paris, France, paints mid-
dle class life with a rich complexity
of color and arrangement. The Span-
ish artist, Salvador Dali, is interested
in surrealism. His painting, “Enig-
matic Elements in Landscape,” is a
typical example of surrealism to
which a certain clarity and reﬁne-
ment have been added. Alexandre
Deineka, a Russian, is important in
artistic and cultural activities in the
Soviet Union. Franz Lenk’s land-
scapes are noted for their individual-
ity and atmosphere.

Andre Derain’s painting “Roses” re-
ceived the Allegheny County Garden
Club prize. Derain is a Frenchman
who won first prize in the 1928 Inter-
national. He is a tireless experiment-
er and a lover of pure color.

Three painters who died recently
are represented for the last time.
Roger Fry, Adolphe Borie, and John
Kane, the Pittsburgh painter whose
primitive work presents clarity of
vision.

Thirteen countries are represented
in the International, 296 artists, and
365 paintings. The jury was compos-
ed of Miss Elizabeth Luther Cary,
art critic; Gifford Beal, artist: and
Alfred H. Barr, museum director.

Battle Tomorrow
Brings Together
Powerful Teams

Weinstock-Weisenbaugh Combine
To I-Iave Beise-Kostka Duo
As Fullback Opponents

 

Panthers battle Gophers at the sta-
dium tomorrow while all the outstand-
ing sports critics look on, hoping that
from this ﬁght there may come some
sort of an answer which will lead said
critics from the chaotic confusion of
determining just who will be national
football champion,

During the past fortnight, reams of
copy have been written out about this

important game. Facts, ﬁgures.
hunches, and traditions have been
dusted off and set into cold type for

anxious fans to read, and, having read,
to wonder. From the heap of data
advanced, a few concrete truths may
be sifted out.

Minnesota will come here with prac-
tically the same team which tumbled
t-he Pitt bandwagon at Minneapolis
last fall. VVitl1 but one exception,
Coach Bernie Bierma.n could send the
identical starting lineup against the
Panthers he used in 1933. The fact
that he won’t do that——but will replace
several of those men with new sopho
mores—indicates quite clearly that
Minnesota is not suffering i'rom lack
of talent.

Pug Lund. Gopher captain and star
halfback, is the big triple—threat man
for the invaders. This hearty fellow,
who had a ﬁnger amputated because
constant injuries to it hurt his foot-
ball-playing, gained more ground last
year than did all the backs playing
against the Minnesotans. Frank Lar-
son, an all-American end last year,
will be back at his old post to try
again to stop Panther sweeps.

Before each Pitt game this fall.
much has been said about Pitt’s duo
of fullbacks, 'Weinstock and VVeisen-
baugh. Always it l1a.s been mentioned
that if a team could take care of VVein-
stock there was still Vveisenbaugh.
and vice versa. Now along comes a
185-pound line crasher named Shel-
don Beise who does some plain and
fancy fullbacking for the Minnesotans.
There need be no shouting of joy
when Beise leaves the game, however,
for trotting into his place will be a
burly young 210-pound giant sporting
an “80” on his back and answering to
the name of Stanislaus Kostka, who
is said to be the answer to an_vone‘s
prayer for a fullback.

For Pitt, there will be the same line-
up which has done well enough in the
three games to date. There is a pos-
sibility that Nicksick may be replaced
by Marlarkey or Randour at left half
back and ‘Da.nie1l_ whose rise as a cap-
able tackle has been a joy to behold,
may be in there at Bob Hoel’s posi-
tion. Otherwise, Sutherland is expect-
ed to bank on the same outﬁt to begin
the first push against the Gophers.

‘The lineup:

Bob Madden Named Fifth
Ranking District Net Man

Bob Madden, ace of last years
freshman tennis team, is now ranked
ﬁfth in this district, according to rat-
ings released by Frank S. McClintock,
chairman of the Pittsburgh Tennis as-
sociation ratings committee,

Madden was beaten out for the
fourth position by only the proverbial
eyelash, Russell Unger succeeding in
nosing him out. Bob might have dis-
placed Unger had the late season's
play been considered, but ,Unger's
consistent play throughout the sum»
mer gave him the edge in the ﬁnal
ratings. ,

Madden’s leap from the junior groups
to ﬁfth position in the senior rank-I
ings was one of the outstanding fea-
tures of the year in the Western
Pennsylvania tennis world.

Gopher Man Without Country

The Pitt Panthers will meet at least one
man Saturday who has no claim on All-Amer-
ica honors. That man is Art Clarkson, star
halfback for the Gophers.

Not that the gentleman isn't good enough
in a football way to win such an honor. He
will probably answer that for himself in the
game Saturday, but the fact is he isn't an

His history reads somewhat like the roll-
call at a League of Nations meeting. He was
born in China of a Swedish mother and a
Rritish father. then moved to Seattle, Wash-
ington, at the age of 14. Up until this time 1
he had never seen a football game. I
