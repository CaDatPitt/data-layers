. While both Dean Steele. Gowe,
School of General -Studies, and
Dean Irwin Schulman,‘ College of
Arts and Sciences, both agree stops
must be’ taken’ to increase the
enrollment of older students at Pitt,
the two deans disagree on the
-methods to be used to reach this
Gowe has proposed that Pitt
allow SGS and part-time students
to ‘take classes in the daytime
starting next fall. Schulman spoke
against allowing‘ SGS students in
daytime classes. . ~

' Associate SGS Dean Robert
Comfort and Schulman discussed

the different approaches of the two 1-
ﬁchools in recent interviews with

the Pitt News.‘

Comfort said SGS ‘wants 

provide part-time education "op-
portunities for those who cannot
attend in the evening. He

pinpointed women, stating “We_'

feel, andwekhave evidence that
there is a large group of mature
women with family obligations who

SGS seeks to serve a clientele that
is not being served, and Comfort

- _ Comfort said _ he feels that
allowing SGS students in daytime
CAS courses would not affect the
classes at all.‘ He explained that 70
to 80 CAS courses are cross-listed

‘in the evening since SGS does not

limit their registration to SGS

students.. _ .
Although: many CAS students

take these "course, this does not

affect the academic environment of '

the class. "He spoke more of mixing
SGS and-CAS students rather than
V offering speciﬁcally SGS courses in
the day. ,-‘t‘There is no needfor a

in separate education program,” said
 Comfort‘.

However Schulman, is against
much mixing of the two’ schools.
“One-problem,” he ‘stated-, “is that

To Discuss Divestment Questions A 

By SUE McFARLAND I
' Piu News Szaffwriter
Representatives of the Anti-Im-
perialist Student Union and two

"A South African political leaders

met yesterday with Student Gov-
ernment, Board members in an
attempt to convince the board to
change its neutral stand on Pitt’s
investments in South African-
based multinational corporations.
The Student Government Board
originally supported the move to
promote divestment by Pitt in these
corporations that support the
apartheid regime- in South‘ Africa
but rescinded this support last

> week to assume a neutral stand.

At yesterday"s.meeting, William
Smith of the University Senate
Commonwealth and Community
Relations Committee was criticized
by the Anti-Imperialist group after
‘he cited some economy-based

-why..h'ave an admissions p_rocess.a_t,,

Comfort pointed out that for an
SGS student to transfer to CAS, he
needs only a. 2.5 average and 18

.—‘credits, and many students trans-_

fer.’ I i.

Schulman expresses concern
about the University remaining a
liberal arts’ university. t“The
essential function of the Univ
sity,” said Schulman, “is ‘the
advancement of knowledge. by
research and scholarship, a liberal
arts education for undergraduates
and professional .training for
graduates.” ~

Although Pitt provides evening
classes; Schulman said he con-
siders this a community‘ service.
He is in ‘favor of some career
training in a controlled’ form/,

barring that it corrupts the other

purposes of the University:

that offering such.-. majofs as

  Officials Hope TowerC Root Soon

By RODNEY B. GRIFFITH ..
Pia: ix;-ws Staffwrilcr
The uncompleted roof of Tower
C, which has led to numerous leaks
into 16th floor rooms in the
residence hall, should be com-

pleted by Friday, University

ofﬁcials said today.

After heavy rains Sunday,
residents of the 16th_ﬂoor used
trash cans, buckets and paper
towels to collect watei that seeped
from the ceiling into approximately

#10 rooms and the hallway on the
' 16th floor.

Lou DiToppa said the leaks had
existed for three years. He said he
had ﬁled maintenance reports and
has talked to maintenance depart-
ment personnel about the problem,

but there had been little progress
on the problem.

“l’ve been living with buckets
for three years,” DiToppa said.

Jack Miller, who is director of
the maintenance department of the
University housing department,
said that S&S Rooﬁng has had
difﬁculties completing the rooﬁng

job because it is a small ﬁrm. The_

contract for the new roof required
originally that the roof be ﬁnished
by Aug. 30. ‘ '

Despite the past problems with
the ropf, Miller said the roof would
be completed soon. “I hope it will
be ﬁnished by the end of the
week,” he said. ' -

A spokeswoman for S&S Rooﬁng
‘said that problems with ﬁnancing

the roofing job had slowed
completion of the roof. She said
that the University Housing main-
tenance department was supposed
to have supplied progressive
payments to S&S Rooﬁng, so that
the ‘company had funds to pay
employees throughout the duration
of the rooﬁng job.

However, she said that the
University had not provided the
funds and the rooﬁng company had
been forced to take other rooﬁng
jobs to raise funds needed to pay
their employees.

According to Miller, the require-
ment that the contract for the
rooﬁng job be given to the lowest
bidder had ‘created problems with

foreign support in the South
African market would result in an
increase in unemployment that

would result in an increase in
unemployment that would affect
the black population first: The

' South African government enforces

a law that any unemployed black
must return _ to . his homeland,
rwhere disease, famine and. a
greater rate of unemployment
exists, according to Smith. ' .
- “I am all I for winning‘ the
independence of those people, but
divestment 7-is " not the answer,’_’
Smith said. “We have to sit down
and discuss our concerns about
how it is going to be done.”

that the ﬁrst contractor who won t

the bid for the roofing job last
spring decided that he did not want
to take the rooﬁng job.

_ After the ﬁrst contractor decided
not to do the job, S&S Rooﬁng won

- a second bidding.

Miller said that the original
damage to the roof of Tower C had»
been caused by the weight of water

beds on the sun deck atop the roof. .

When the maintenance department
ﬁrst discovered the leaks in the

, roof, maintenance tried to patch

the roof with tar paper. He said
that solution was not successful, so
it was decided that a new roof had
to be put on the residence hall.

Four members of the ‘Fraternal Association of Steel

The bullets struck the truck's tires and radiator, but

ANCHORAGE, Alaska——A small ‘chartered plane

seriously injuring Sen. Ted Stevens and killing his wife and
four other persons. One other passenger survived.

Stevens, the Senate’s assistant Republican leader, was
hospitalized in stable condition after the Lear jet crashed

His 49-year-old wife of 26 years, Ann, home from

  A Four-member
Student
Government
Board?

Last week the Student Government Board rescin-
ded its early support and decided to maintain a
neutral position concerning University investmen-
ments that support the apartheid regime. Yesterday,
members of the Pitt Anti-Imperalist Student Union
organized a meeting to discuss the effects of South
Africa on students. Ike Mafola of the Pan Africanist
Congress and Tirivafi Kangai, U.N. representative
from the Zimbabwe African National Union spoke at
the meeting in hopes of changing the board’s stance.

However, the board only made as partial
showing only members Jan Medoff, Stan Galanski,
Diane Béheres and Sharon Starzinski actually
discussed the issues at hand. To addinsult to injury,
board President Josh Baylson and twogzear board
member-David Hesidence did not emerge from an ad-
jacent room in the Student Government suite, saying
they were working on another project.

Certainly the board has the right to remain neutral
on the situation, butmeeting with the union and their

guests was not an act of endorsement, only a

willingness to become informed on aspects of the
issue. V »

Apparently,‘ there is some confusion in the minds
of some SGB—members as to the difference between
neutrality and understanding the facts. Moreover,
the disrespectful absence of Baylsonand Hesidence

The question here is not really if SGB should sup-
port the union, but if the board can retain impar-
tiality on an issue and treat each organization fairly
by , carefully viewing new evidence on both sides.
By refusing to meet with the union and their guests,
Baylson and Hesidence cast a bad light on the board.

Galanski and Medoff are to be commended for at-
tempting to give at least fair showing, but without
the full board, particularly Baylson, their honest stab
at respectability lacked substance. Behers and Star-
zinski, who joined the group later, were also on the
right track.

A unified showing ,of SGB"would have added aﬁ"

'touch of class to the shoddy treatment of a Pitt

organization and the disregard of very real political
question. Galanski explained the -board was “only a
group of seven people with limited objectives,” but
yesterday’s’- meeting gave the impression that. only
four members of the board taketheir duties seriously
enought to strive for true objectivity.

Letters     .      
.iS0ci0biol0gyand Hubbard ’s [ﬁlth Century Pseudoscience

On Nov. 30 prof. Ruth Hubbard

“ . addressed a segment of the Pitt

academic community under the
auspices of the Women's Studies
Program on the topic “Socio-
biology: Its Relation to Women's
Issues." As a sociobiologist with
an interest-in female and male
reproductive strategies, I attended.

The talk was extremely dis-
appointing; it was at the very least
mistitled, as very little sociobiolog-
ical material was presented.

‘Humbbard discussed a series of

issues in 19th century pseudo-
science—the medical view of
female physiology as pathological;
whether females have smaller
brains, and, if so, why-'-—which are
dead controversies and, at any
rate. outside the realm of socio-

was nothing less than an insult to the uni

guests.

SGB’s fluctuating stance on the issue is a prime
example of the pinwheel politics that prevailed in
boards of the past, which Baylson’s administration
has tried to avoid. But a respectful turnout of the

board does not mean there will be yet another switch

in policy.

Her argument seemed to be one
of guilt by association: He who
looks for any sort of sex differences
is an opponent of women's rights.
Furthermore, she erred in two
fundamental ways in presenting
the sociobiological view. Firstly,
sociobiology was characterized as a
reincarnation of the old biologically
determinist perspective on the
nature-nurture (genes-environ-
ment) controversy. Nothing could
be further from the truth, as both
she (a microbiologist) and the
sociobiologists subscribe to the
same model of gene-environment
interaction; genes produce differ-
ent results in different environ-
ments.

Secondly, she said socio-
biologists believe there are uni-
versal sex differences. This is

equally false.
subscribe to the theory of sexual
selection, which is simply a
category of natural selection, the
driving force in evolution. Without
going ‘into detail, suffice it to say
that the theory predicts minimal
differences between the sexes
under some circumstances. Under
other circumstances, females and
males are expected to evolve
somewhat disparate characterist-
ics. _

And most inportantly, a third set
of conditions can be specified
under which “female” and “male”
characteristics are reversed. Data
from hundreds of species confirm
these predictions.

- Thus there are no universal

—“female" or “male" characters,

rather, sociobiology is able to

biological theory.

is the only clear intersection
between sociobiology and women's
issues, yet "it was not even touched
upon. q

I was allowed a single question
and attempted to elicit why
Hubbard ignored the sociobiologi-
cal view of sexual selection in her
hour-long presentation. Citing two
works, she replied that the more

popular source was most relevant -

toa presentation for a lay audience.

Firstly, I disagree in principle and
regularly teach a rigorous and
up-to-date version of sexual selec-
tion to my lower-level sociobiology
class in a single period. Hubbard
owed an equally .clear and

definitive statement to her audi-

ence‘and her sponsors.
Secondly, the ‘alternative source
she mentioned (Trivers and Hare)

has absolutely nothing to do with

the evolution of sex differences: It
is l a technical paper on the
evolution of sterile castes in ants,
bees and wasps.

This, as well as Hubbard’s
replies. to certain other questions
from‘ the ﬂoor, revealed a rather
meager knowledge of the socio-
biological view of sex differences.
Perhaps even more alarming was

' remains.

the response of a, significant
proportion of the audience, that an
accurate portrayal of - sociobiologi-
cal theory was not a necessary
prerequisite to damning it. ‘ 
Beyond the inaccuracy of Hub-

A theme of Hubbard’s
talk was that one’s politics colors

 K|SSGui’rorist Paul Stanley

Promotes Soo Release

By PATTY TASCARELLA
f Pitt News Staff Writer
Oasis Records in Bloomﬁeld was
jammed with people Monday

 afternoon. They ﬁlled the store and
~waited in line outside, but not to

purchase an album- or concert
tickets. The occasion was a visit
from KISS guitarist Paul Stanley,
currently on a ﬁve-city junket to
promote his solo album, titled,
appropriately enough, “Paul Stan-
ley.” _

Six Pittsburgh policemen di-

rected the crowd into orderly lines-

and more than 2,000 people passed
through the store on a trip that‘ took
a good 45 minutes—all for
autographs and a few words with

. Stanley.

Stanley, looking improbably like
a gargoyle transplanted from the

gs.-,walls of a gothic cathedral to a
garage sale, sat at a table beneath.

a poster of Chicago and signed

autographs for _a predominently --

junior high and pre-teen crowd.
Clad in black leather, Stanley
was in full KISS makeup-—-white
Kabuki face paint, blood red lips
and ‘his trademark of a black star
etched around his right eye.

Two girls, each clutching a sheet.

of yellow paper emblazoned with “I
Love You—Paul Stanley,” col-
lapsed in each other’s arms,
sobbing. They walked in a daze to a
small car with “We Love Paul”
signs plastered over the wind-
shield;

“Paul is the lover, the roman-
ticist ofthe band,” said Carol Kaye
of The Press Office, the publicity
ﬁrm handling KISS. '

The crowd at Oasis seemed to
bear this out—-—-among the 7-year
olds in Steeler jackets were many
teenage girls, some clutching

long-stemmed American Beauty

roses to give to Stanley.
“KISS is very happy and
appreciative to meet with fans/j’

said Kaye. “It’s always been that .
v way.

As the throngs lined up outside
the store, a lone man paced front
of the windows, berating rock

bands in general and KISS in.

particular.

“I can’t see coming here to get
this guy's autograph,” he said.
‘ ‘He's only here to sell records,‘ and
this is good publicity. It’s not hard
to be nice to a bunch of kids for a
few hours.”

What was he doing at Oasis,
then? _

“I’m waiting for a friend. She’s
26, and she just had to come to see
this guy,” he said.

The simultaneous release of solo
albums by all four KISS members-

. The simultaneous release of solo
albums by all four KISS mem-
bers—Stanley, drummer Peter
Criss and guitarists Ace,Frehley
and'Gene Simmons—is something
of a phenomenon in rock music.
Each album already has sold more
than a million copies, and sales of
Stanley’s have been “very good,”
according to Oasis. According "to
Kaye, Stanley’s single release,
“Hold Me, Touch Me,” is doing
well on the charts.

While each member of KISS has
been making solo appearances to
promote ' sales, they also are
gearing for an early summer tour,
currently in the planning stages,
according to Kaye. ‘

Kaye said the appearances were
dependent upon availability. An

informed of Stanley’s proposed
visit Thursday, three days before
the event.

true celebration of life and love.

“Lord Of The Rings” is a song * ' '

throughout the song. Witness the

“Renegade,” the song about a
man sentenced to death by the law
is a well-balanced song. Every-
thing--the words, the music, the
energy and spirit--is balanced
between tension and release.

The ﬁnal song of the album and
the title track, “Pieces of Eight,
warns of the lure of money.
Beginnignwith a gentle piano riff,

the song weaves and draws us into R
‘its mystery. The music grows as

we feel our own grandeur grow
The song reminds us of how we all
run through life, never stopping to

‘Pieces of Eight'(I3ooid Showing

see its beauty and mystery. It
reminds us all that all achievement
is barrenif we have sold our souls
in the process. “Pieces of Eight”
is a masterpiece of music and
lyrics, insurance that legendary
music will illuminate our way for
some time to come.

way for some time come.

a mistake.

cannot create hormone-related health

,, Pitt News sum Writer

,.Pitt’s maturing basketball
Panthers survived a first-half

 famine and, led by Terry Knight

and Wayne Williams, came within
two points of handling their fans a
feast during last night's 88-69 win
against Evansville.

A small but enthusiastic Field

‘A House crowd, spurred by Mc-

Donald’s promotion that offered
free food and was based on Pitt’s
point total, cheered the Panthers to
a second-half surge and their third
‘win of the young season.

While the fans‘ (attendance was

22.3.46) were screaming “Cokes,”

“fries” and (in vain) “burgers,”
Pitt, down by four points with 15
minutes remaining, spent the next

10 minutes building a lead that:

several times exceeded 20 points.
It was announced before the

. I game that McDonald’s would give

fans free food after a Panther win
under the following conditions:

80 Panther points would be

rewarded with a Coke, 85 points
would bring a Coke and french fries

and 90 points would entitle. each

coupon-bearing fan to a Coke, fries
and a hamburger.

But Pitt and its fans were better
concerned with the basketball
game during the first half;' the
Panthers, faced with a well-

coached and gutty group of

Evansville Aces, never led by
more than four points during the
first half and trailed, 37-34, after 20

minutes.

“That was a quiet locker room at 

halftime,” Pete Strickland, the
Panther sparkplug, said‘. “It’s
usually full of people jumping and
hollering, but tonight it was

quiet... it could be that’sa sign of ..

experience.”

‘‘It was kind of quiet in there,”
said Carlton Neverson, who in the
second half aroused Pitt’s fans and

‘team with a , soaring slam that

keyed Pitt’s.decisive scoring
splurge. “Everyone was just
looking at himself, deciding what
he had to do in that second half.”
.Pitt scored 54 points -during
those ﬁn_al 20 minutes-‘-20 more
than it amassed ‘ in the first
half—bu't . Knight was not so
sporadic as his teammates. “ .

performance. Knight, 'a senior

Williams, all. of whose 21 points
came after halftime, said he was

bothered during the first half’

because of—though not . by—a
bruised right knee.

“It was all the waiting around
that hurt me,’—’ Williams said. “I
have to get to the Field House early

’ to take whirlpool,_ heat and sound

treatment, and all that sitting
around before a game is no good,
The knee doesn't hurt, that much,
but that waiting sure did.” A

It was fortunate for Pitt that
Knight, Williams and Sam Ellis (17
points, nine rebounds) produced as
they did, since Sam Clancy, whose

'concem for an ill relative may have

injured his performance, scored
-four points (his average had been
Clancy also had eight
rebounds and a‘ ﬂirt with serious
injury during his 22 minutes of
play. _ ‘

With 16:47 remaining in ‘the

break, tangled with a brave (but,
perhaps, insane) Evansville, guard
in the. air about’ the hoop.-
The ball went up and in, but Clancy
was down and out. He walked to
the’ bench and stayed there, not

28 Points,  Rebounds

Give Knight Team Leads

By MARIA SCIULLO
Pin News Staff Writer

Off court, forward Terry Knight
is a low-key person. Very low key.
To hear him tell the storyvof Pitt’s
somewhat sloppy but nonetheless
satisfying 88-69 win against Evans-
one would believe Pitt’s
number 34 had barely ‘been
present; he doubled as water boy,
perhaps. 3‘

In truth, Knight's performance
last night was as noteworthy as any
by a Panther thus far in the young‘
season. He didn’t use slam dunks;
no, last night they belonged ‘\to
Sammie Ellis, Carlton Neverson-.
and Sam Clancy (although Clancy’s
was wiped out;by a charging foul).
He didn’t power. his way through
the Purple Aces’ pair 6-10‘
buildings either. The brother of
former Pitt all-America Billy
Knight ﬁnessed his way to 28
points, .13 rebounds and a pair of
assists.

l

As a ﬁfth-year senior, Knight
has endured many comparisons.
Fans wanted to see whether Terry
was another Mooney, a “Knight to
Remember.” But Terry is his. own
man on the court. While his
career-high 28 points were evenly.
dispersed throughout the contest,

1

many‘ came at crucial moments in
the first half when Pitt was
struggling just to stay in the game.
When personal fouls sent Clancy
to the bench, Knight had little
choice but to confront the taller and
heavier Evansville front line.

“Terry goes inside for us when
Sam goes out of the game with foul
trouble,”
Grgurich. ‘ ‘But we like to keep him
outside because\he’s. more effective
there; he can rebound well against
a smaller player.”

With’ more than eight minutes to V

play in the game and the Panthers

ahead by 15 Pitt’s offense ran a ‘A

slowdown, which was not apprec-
iated by the sparse crowd.

“We'weren’t really freezing the
ball,” explained Knight, “but we
were losing it so often that we just
had to slow things down and not
force shots.”

After the game, the man who
had beocme the team leader in
scoring (18.3 points per game) and
rebounds (12 per game) and had
once said, “I never pass judgment
on myself or anyone else,”
remained true to form when asked
to commentgon his performance:
“We won and that’s all I can say.
The team won.”

game were protested. And many
fans were upset when\ Pitt’s
reserves, a .lineup of freshmen,
failed to reach 90’ points.

‘‘_I’d still like to~do_ it (the
promotion),", Pitt coach Tim
Grgurich said. “But something
like this shouldn’t penalize our
kids. ‘It was a great thing, but we
might have to try
different in the future-—I think the
fans forgot about the games...and
our kids...near the’ end.

“But it’s tough to get on our
fans,” he added.» ‘‘If anyone has
been loyal to us during the last.
three years, it’s been
students.” -

Grgurich also ‘had praise for. his ,-
defense, which throttled Evansville .
while the Panthers drove toward

' their win.

“Coaches (Fran), Webster and
(Jim) Bolla deserve credit for that
defense,” Grgurich said. “And we
had some excellent defense ’t§7?~

PITT NOTES—The Panthers

bounded its opponent (53-38) for

what promotion—if any—Mc-
Donald’s would sponsor Saturday

Rose turned down the Phillies’

changed his mind when the Phillies
added a year to the pact, and with

 certain incentive clauses raised the

By LINDA VENZON

Pitt News Staff Writer ~
The Pitt women’s swim team had
an impressive weekend by adding a

4 I‘ ;win and a loss to its record. The
T Pantherettes hosted both a double

dual meet against Eastern
Michigan and North Carolina on
Friday and the Pitt Relay Invita-

A tionals Saturday at Trees Pool.

Pitt won 13 of 15 events in
defeating Eastern Michigan, 102-
27, but suffered a disappointing
loss to North Carolina, 79-52, in
which they won only four events.

It was the first loss of the season

-2 under coach Dick Bradshaw, who

had said North Carolina would be
the only obstacle in Pitt's path
toward an undefeated season.

Pitt defensive end Hugh
Green was named to UPI
All-American team yesterday.
The Panther sophomore joined
six Penn State players on the
first-team, including Matt
Millen, Bruce Clark, Pete

“We looked respectable against
them,” said Bradshaw. “North
Carolina probably had the best
recruited freshman class in the
nation. Pitt had the best Eastern
recruitment. ’ ’

That was evident, as Pantherette
freshmen Nancy Henry, Linda
Frankenbach and Julie Terrell
registered wins either individually
or in a relay in the North Carolina
meet, along with returning letter-
men Kathy Stetler, Cindy Ferraro
and Suzanne Pulley.

Pitt went on to sweep the
100-yard butterﬂy event; Henry
won, with Terrell placing second
and freshman Amy Jackson ﬁnish-
ing third.

Freshman Judy Klotz broke the
Pitt team record in the 400-yard
individual medley by 18 seconds
with a‘ time of 4:31.09 against
Eastern Michigan. The other
record-setter was Pulley, who
in the
100-yard breaststroke with a time
of 1:08.06. Stetler came back to
win the 100-yard freestyle after
winning the 200-yard freestyle.

The Pitt Invitationals featured
three of the top four teams in the
East: Pitt, Penn Sate and Rutgers.
Pitt entered the final event

(800-yard freestyle relay) leading _

by two points. Although the
Pantherette relay team.improved
its qualifying time for the national

championships by 10 seconds, it ,

failed to accumulate the. necessary
points and lost to North Carolina.
Pitt won four events in the relay
invitationals; new meet records
were set in the 200-yard backstroke
and 200-yard freestyle relays. Pitt
also won the 200-yard butterﬂy
relay and placed first in three-
meter diving. 0

Teey  me, Exnerience m   are 

By LINDA VENZON
Pitt News Staff Writer

, Anyone who has played major
Gollege football has the same
dream of graduating to the
National Football League. There is
a big step between stardom in
college and playing as a rookie in

the NFL. A '
Last year’s Pitt stars who
currently are playing in the NFL all
.would agree that playing on a
national ‘championship team has
opened a lot of doors for them. Bob
Jury and Elliott Walker of the San
Francisco Forty-Niners say profes-
sional football requires adjust-
ments they were unaccustomed to

‘  college life.

“There is -no security if I lose my
job,” Jury says. “I feel the
pressure in the big leagues, and I
can’t afford to make many
mistakes.” . , .

But a rookie is expected to learn
from his mistakes, and Jury has
made quite a few, as anyone who
saw the recent Pittsburgh-San
Francisco game could attest. Still,
he has started at strong safety the

last ﬁve games and has come a long
rway since his hectic start. I
Jury was a third-round draft pick
of the Seattle Seahawks and spent
most of his training camp there
until he was traded to San
Francisco. He was angry. leaving
Seattle, but his recent marriage has
helped the former Pitt All-

,American through a period of '

turmoil.

Walker had a different type of_

adjustment to make. After starting
at Pitt for three years, he plays only
on San Francisco’s specialty teams.

“I just can’t get used to warming
the bench,” Walker says. “After a
while it begins to affect you
psychologically, but I try to

concentrate on learning what It

can.” .

Every player has to'adj11st his
personal life to a team’s system.
There ‘had been some feeling of
discomfort within the Forty-Niners
organization because of the recent
coaching changes. Both Walker
and Jury say communication with
the coaches plays a big part in a
player’s attitude.

“Coach (Fred) O’Connor knows
how to talk to a player,” Walker
says. “Before he stepped in, the
team was_ a bit uncomfortable
because we weren't winning many
games and weren't playing well.”

O’Connor recently replaced Pete
McCulley as head coach, along
with other coaching changes.

“In the month I worked under
McCulley, Ibelieved he had a good
attitude, yet-he was hard to relate
to,” says Jury. “Coach O’Connor
is the type of coach who wants
everyone to be part of a big family.
He wants players to come to him
with any problem but also to
perform to the best of their
ability.”

The changes reflect the changes
made in the Pitt coaching system.

“Coach (Johnny) Majors was a
good public relations man, and he
also ‘ could talk to the players,
whereas my relationship with
Coach (Jackie) Sherrill ‘improved
after the Gator bowl,” says Jury.

Walker believes it is up to the
coaches to make a player under-
stand what they want.

»._

 7'75 ix 

“Coaches McCulley and Sherrill
thought they had an understanding
with the players,” says Walker,
“and they don’t.”

Now that the players have made
the team, they are beginning to
enjoy the fringe beneﬁts that

comes with the recognition of being-

a pro football player. But they still
remember the tense feeling of
summer camp and the hauntings of
“The Turk’ ’—the fear of being cut.

“All during camp the question in I

the back of my mind was how long
will this last?” says Jury. “I only‘
could think next year it will be
easier.”

In college, a player focuses on
the fundamentals and tries to grasp
a feel for the basic techniques at
each position. In the pro ranks;
techniques must be mastered, and
a player uses his skills along with
increased mental learning.

“I was pretty nervous going to
pro camp,” says Walker. “The
play book was tough. In the NFL
you have to know what everyone
else is doing; in college ball, you

        

.. .00 '9 .

work only at your own-‘plojsition.
“The other players helped out,

but at the beginning of the year I _

was’ competing with 0.J. Simpson
and two returning vets.” ‘ '

The assistance Walker received, «,

combined with his persistance, has
moved him up to the second-string

running back position behind Paul_

Hoffer now that Simpson has been

placed on the injured reserve list.“.

' Jury also has received help from
his teammates._ . ‘

' “I didn't feel, intimidated by
other players. In fact, I’ve learned
a lot from returning veteran Chuck

, Crist, who played my position last

year,” says Jury. - I ,
Both players are happy with their
new lives as professional football
players, and they enjoy living in
San Francisco. ‘-
f‘The" people are nice, but it’s
expensive as hell,’,’ says Jury.
“My family’s at home, and I miss

the seasonal changes. I’ll be home f

as soon as I ﬁnish my job here. .I
still need 14 credits to get my
degree in criminology at Pi .”

Swanson’s Lineup Proves Successful For Pitt Swimmers?

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt swimcoach’ Fred Lewis did
 uncommon last weekend and
allowed his team to choose the
starting lineup for the Penn State

Invitational Relay Championship.
The move paid off, as the 1-0

_ Panthers ﬁnished first with a meet

record 340 points. North Carolina,
loser to Pitt last week at Trees Pool,
was second. The Tarheels won last
year’s championship, while Pitt
was second. The meet pits the top
12 teams from the East. '

I “If -it were a dual meet, I
probably wouldn’t have let them
make‘ out —the starting lineup.”
Lewis explained. “But since it was
only a relay championship and it

'“”A&idn't affect our-won-loss record, I

thought I would let them be the
coaches and
,hneup.

choose a starting-

“I received about ﬁve or six
lineup suggestions,” Lewis contin-
ued. “We discussed all of them
going up on the van and decided
Stu Swanson’s was the best. We

had nothing to lose by using it.”

Lewis, in fact, believed his team

had everything to gain.

“My lineup would have been a
lot more conservative than Stu’s,”
the ﬁrst-year coach said. “We
probably wouldn’t have won if we
had used mine. Stu’s lineup gave
us a chance.” .

Lewis added that he never would

‘have thought of moving Bob

Greenwald from the 400-yard

I freestyle to the 400-yard medley
-relay team, or Tom McGinley from

the 400-yard freestyle‘ to the
200-yard freestyle relay team. But
Swanson, a sophomore from

Florida, d-id, and Pitt ﬁnished first I

in both events.

Besides the 200-yard freestyle
(McGinley, Mickey Termin, Jeff
Trew and Rick Carter) and 400-yard
individual medley (Greenwald, Bob
_Clemmer, ‘ Swanson and Mark
Schuman), Pitt ﬁnished ﬁrst in the

400-yard freestyle (Termin, Schu-
man, Greenwald and Carter) and
200-yard individual medley (Swan-
son, Carter, Schuman and McGin-
ley).

The Panthers set meet records in

both the 200-yard freestyle and
200-yard individual medley.

Scott Winkler, and Pat Green-
well; meanwhile, combined for a
meet record 650 points in three-me-
ter diving. '

Howard Almost Fouls Up I-loopers

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Staff Writer
The Pitt women’s basketball
team extended its winning streak
by defeating Howard University,
78-75, Saturday. The win evens the
Pantherettes’ record at 2-2 but the
two losses came during a tipoff

tournament.

Pitt was forced to alter its game
plan after, two ‘starters, Wanda

Randolph and Carol Dugan, got‘
I into foul trouble early in the ﬁrst‘
half. Randolph, in her first start of

the season because of an eye

injury, and Dugan each were
tagged with three fouls in the initial
10 minutes of the game. “That
forced us into playing a more
conservative game,” said coach
Jean Balthaser. 1

Once Randolph and Dugan were
in trouble, there was need for
depth, and Gail Aughburns and
Rita Rodriquez responded.

The Pantherettes regrouped
because of the bench strength and

.the ﬁrst _half ended, with the

Pantherettes on top, 40-37
“When a team is on the road and

they ﬁnd themselves behind early
in the game, it’s very easy for the
home team to capture the
momentum and blow you out,”
said Balthaser. A
good job by taking control of this

momentum after we were behind ,
Then we ’-

most of the ﬁrst half.
were able to take the lead at
halftime and win the game.” I
