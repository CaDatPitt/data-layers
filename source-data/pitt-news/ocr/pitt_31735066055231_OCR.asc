After only an hour of delibera-
tion Wednesday, a jury acquitted a
Pitt senior of rape charges stem-
ming from an incident in Lothrop
Hall in January.

Judge Lawrence
O’Toole declared a mis-
trial on related sexual
assault charges against
Todd David DeCato.

DeCato jumped in
the air and beamed out-
side the courtroom fol-
lowing the jury’s unani-
mous decision to acquit
him. DeCato, his family
and his defense team
quickly left the court-
room after the verdict
without making a state-
ment.

The jury, a panel consisting of

eight women and four men, didn’t
find the evidence to convict.

“There wasn’t a lot of concrete

was acquitted of

evidence to support a guilty verdict.
And so based on a reasonable
doubt, we felt we couldn’t convict,”
said jury forewoman Elizabeth
Stohr.
But DeCato isn’t out of the
woods yet because jurors voted 11-
1 to acquit him of sexual
assault charges. Sexual
"assault and rape trials
require a unanimous vote
for acquittal. O’Toole
scheduled the sexual
assault trial for Feb. 3,
1999.

“The one person that
perceived there was a
guilty verdict believed
that she [the victim] had
said ‘no’ firmly and res-
olutely, and through
forcible action, he did
have intercourse with
her,” Stohr said.

People who eat in campus cafe-
terias might be more satisfied with
selection and service if they aren’t
Pitt students, according to Food
Services personnel.

According to Sodexho-Marriott
representative Abdu Cole, students
from other campuses are impressed
with the fact that Pitt students can
buy small amounts of food with
Dining Dollars instead of spending
a whole block.

“They’ll say, ‘Wow, we can’t do
that,”’ said Cole, addressing a
group of students during a forum on
food service held in Room 304 of
the Cathedral of Learning
Wednesday evening.

Pi Sigma Alpha, the national
political science honor society,
offered the forum as an opportunity
for students to voice their concerns.

Jason Zaroff, a junior, ques-
tioned the change this year to week-
ly restrictions on the number of
blocks students can use.

Farina, the food services director.

There must be enough demand
from students on campus to imple-
ment any change in the system, she
said, adding that she felt “the
majority of students did not have a
problem with the meal-plan restric-
tions.”

Food Services handed out sur-
veys asking students’ opinions of
the change, but very few were
returned. Sallade-Farina said she
assumed that meant students were
content.

The decision to make the
restrictions was a difficult one,
Sallade-Farina said. Some parents
also pressured the University
implement the restrictions.

Other concerns students brought
up included the a lack of kosher
meals and the high cost of catering
provided by Food Services.

“Sodexho has visions for the
future,” Sallade-Farina said.

Derrick Sanders, a
Pitt theatre arts
graduate student,
teaches Intro to
Performance at Pitt
and has enjoyed
acting since

high school.

Pitt instructor tuns love of ~
theatre into full-time career

Christal Hall

Staff Wrlter

As Derrick Sanders walked to
his performance class, he thought to
himself, “How can someone fail
Intro to Performance?”

A few students fail Sanders’
class each year — usually those who
don’t come to class, refuse to do the
work, or think that because he’s
young and black he’s going to cut
them a break. -

“I love to teach,” said Sanders.
“But some black students have lost
their edge. They forget that they are
in competition with students from
Harvard or Princeton who work 10
times harder.”

Sanders, 24, is a Pitt graduate
student in his last year of the
University’s master’s of fine arts
program in theatre arts concentrat-
ing in acting. He started teaching in
August 1996 after he received his
bachelor of fine arts degree from
Howard University, a historically
all-black university in Washington,
D.C.

Pitt junior Anitra Billington said
she was enrolled in Sanders’ class
during the second term of her fresh-
man year.

“At first, I didn’t want to take
the class because he gave a speech
saying if you didn’t want to be

embarrassed, then you shouldn’t
take the class,” said Billington. “In
the long run, I’m glad I took it
because I probably wouldn’t have
been exposed to the plays.”

She said Sanders’ class made her
open up more.

“He was cool,” she said. “He
was a teacher and a friend. He was
funny and down to earth.”

Sanders was born and raised in
Newport News, Va. He said his love
of acting started in fifth grade when
he got the lead role in “Jack the
Giant Killer.”

“My teacher told me that in
order for me to keep my part I had
to keep quiet in class all year long
because I was very talkative,” said
Sanders.

So he didn’t say a word all year
because he didn’t want to lose his
part to his understudy.

Sanders smiled as he reminisced
about his middle-school days, but a
sudden sound of displeasure came to
his voice as he talked about his
guidance counselor.

One day he had an appointment
with her to talk about what he
planned on doing with his life. She
asked him what his future plans
were. He told her he wanted to be a
private investigator or detective

THE PITT News 3

TRIAL

alternate jurors said they felt the
testimony should lead to an acquit-
tal.

Linda Seaman, an alternate
juror said, “If she really, really did-
n’t want him to be there with her
and continue to stay at the point
where they were kissing and hug-
ging and he unhooked her bra, she
would have at that point said, ‘Get
lost. Get out of here,’ and could
have just very easily, I think,
opened her door and walked out.”

Annetta Butkowski, the other
alternate juror, agreed with
Seaman.

“That’s basically it for me. I
mean, that’s the way I felt from
when I heard her testimony,” said
Butkowski.

The woman who accused
DeCato, former Pitt student Lauri
Cole, requested to have her name
printed against normal Pitt News
policy. She said she wanted others
to know that she is a survivor.

“What happened to me, unfortu-
nately, happens to a lot of women,”
said Cole, who was a freshman last
year. “Sadly, many survivors of
rape, date rape and sexual assault
don’t go as far as the American
judicial system. Most women even
don’t report their assaults. It’s a
hard thing to go through, yet sur-
vivors must take a stand.”

Cole said she was not upset with
the verdict.

“I am not disappointed about
the verdict because it is not over,”
she said referring to the pending
sexual assault trial. “It is far from
over. I thank God I had the strength
to come this far.”

Cole said support from her fam-
ily, friends and the Campus
Women’s Organization pushed her

FROM PAGE 1

to press charges.

During the trial, Cole testified
that she and DeCato were acquain-
tances, and he visited her room
when the incident happened.

She testified that she said,
“Let’s stop. I don’t want to do this.
Stop. He just kept going. He didn’t
stop. His weight was on me. I was
in shock. I was trying to push him
away, but he wouldn’t listen. Then
he ejaculated in me.”

DeCato testified that he did not
rape Cole but that she consented to
sex and changed her attitude when
he had to leave to meet friends after

having sexual intercourse with her.

“‘You just are going to have
sex with me and leave? I thought
we were going to do something
afterwards,’ was her response when
I
had to leave,” testified DeCato. “I
told her, ‘Why would I just spend
all this time with you if I just want-
ed to have sex with you?” he said.

Later, three Pitt students testi-
fied as character witnesses for
DeCato. Jennifer Houtz, Jaime
Brewer and Jacqueline Kelly testi-
fied that DeCato’s reputation for
truthfulness and sexual morality
was excellent.

Pitt Police Cmdr. Kathy
Schreiber, a detective sergeant
investigating the charges at the
time, testified, “She seemed to be
fatigued, upset, but calm. It seemed
as though she had been through a
lot.”

Cole’s friend, Pitt sophomore
Rachel Bodack, said she was very
unhappy with the verdict.

“Justice was not served today,”
she said. “[Cole] was cheated by
the United States legal system. This
‘not guilty’ verdict of rape is a
prime example of why so many
women are reluctant to come for-
ward and be as courageous as the
survivor Lauri is.”

because of what he _saw on televi-
sion.

“She asked me if I have ever
thought of working with my hands,
possibly at the shipyard because a
lot of black men in my city worked
there,” said Sanders. “She instantly
assumed that just because I was
black, I wanted to work there too.”

So Sanders glared at her and
said “No, no. I want to be a doctor
or lawyer.”

Sanders said she then respond-
ed, “‘Oh, so that means you’re
going to college.”’ He said, “Yes.”

“That’s when I started to think
about what I wanted to do with my
life,” said Sanders, “She wanted to
guide me to something less than
what I was by guiding me. to do
something with my hands.”

Sanders said he will never forget
that counselor, but when he entered
high school, he didn’t have too
much time to think about her igno-
rance; his time was consumed by
track and theatre.

THE Prrr N I-:ws

During high school, Sanders
acted in many plays and joined the
Thespian Society. In his sophomore
year, he became the president of the
organization, and in his junior year,
he was in the National Honor
Society. '

“During my senior year of high
school, I was known as the best
actor in the city and school,”
Sanders said.

Like most seniors" in high
school, Sanders said he visited col-
leges, including Virginia
Commonwealth University in
Richmond, Va. ‘

“I was told to wear what was
comfortable to me. So I wore baggy
jeans and a big shirt. One white
instructor asked me why I wore
what I wore, and I told them, ‘You
told me to wear what was comfort-
able,”’ said Sanders.

Sanders said that after the expe-
rience, he never returned to the uni-
versity and decided to attend
Howard University, majoring in the-
atre education.

Unlike his middle-school coun-
selor, his college adviser told him

that he had to decide if he wanted to
be an actor or a teacher. Sanders
changed his major to theatre arts
with a concentration in acting.

“I decided to be an actor,
although I still loved teaching,” said
Sanders, “so I called home and told
my parents about my decision on
acting. They said, ‘I thought that’s
what you wanted to do.”’

At Howard, Sanders studied
under Al Freeman Jr., the actor who
played Elijah Mohammad in Spike
Lee’s “Malcolm X.” Sanders has
also attended workshops with
Howard alumni Phylicia Rashad and
Debbie Allen.

When he was a senior, Sanders
traveled to New York for three days
to audition for scholarships.

“I was offered a lot of scholar-
ships for graduate school, and Pitt
offered me a full scholarship plus
allowed me to teach,” said Sanders.

He decided to attend Pitt
because he wanted to re-assert him-
self.

Sanders thinks that sometimes
black universities are not represen-
tative of society, saying,
“Sometimes I went three months
without seeing a white person.”

He said there’s very little differ-
ence between Pitt and Howard stu-
dents. What he did notice was that a
lot of black students formed cliques.

Sanders’ acting experience isn’t
limited to the stage; it extends to the
big screen. In June, he acted in the

THURSDAY, 3 DECEMBER 1998

move “Dogma” with Matt Damon
and Linda Fiorentino. Sanders sat
on the edge of his chair, his eyes
widened, as he reminisced about his
funniest moment on the set of the
movie. He played a gangster named
“Gangster.”

“We were in the North Side
shooting the movie, and my role was
playing a Blood. What I didn’t know
was we were in Crypt territory. This
one Crypt walked up to me and
asked me if I was real Blood and
told me that I was lucky that I was-
n’t,” said Sanders laughing.

From the North Side in
Pittsburgh to Grahamstown, South
Africa, Sanders is entertaining a
variety of audiences.

He and fellow Pitt grad student
Javon Johnson went to South Africa
to the Grahamstown Theatre
Festival. The two friends went there
to present the two plays Johnson
wrote and Sanders acted in. Johnson
said he wrote the characters specifi-
cally for Sanders.

Sanders said that 10 years from
now, he hopes to have a movie
career, with some strong television
and film roles. That may just happen
because Johnson said he’s seen
Sanders grow into a stronger actor
over the years.

“He has a stronger intellect of
how to arrange business, and his
goals have become more defined
because of the [M.F.A.] program,”
Johnson said.

Exxon-Mobil merger won't
hurt U.S. gasoline consumers

Critics call it the reformation
of the infamous Standard Oil Co.
Some call it Rockefel1er’s revenge.

Oil giants Exxon and Mobil
armounced their $80 billion merg-
er deal Tuesday. The two giant oil
companies, one with a blatant dis-
regard for the environment and the
other with a record of supporting
military dictatorships in oil pro-
ducing countries, are joining
forces. The merger will create the
world’s largest company, overtak-
ing General Motors and surpassing
the Royal Dutch-Shell Group as
the world’s largest oil company.

The merger is, in the current
economic climate, the wisest deci-
sion for both Exxon and Mobil.
The current low price of oil, cur-
rently $11.13 a barrel, due to an
oversupply in the market (thanks
to the Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries) is eating
away proﬁts. In order to be com-
petitive in the oil market, both
companies needed to cut costs. A
merger was the most viable solu-
tion.

The Federal Trade
Commission may require the new
company, the Exxon Mobil Corp.,
to sell off some of its divisions, so
the corporation will be seen as

operating fairly in a competitive
market.

A major detrimental effect is
the loss of 9,000 jobs. Another fear
is that the merger will drive up the
price of gasoline. However, the
price of gasoline is likely to go up
anyway, considering the price of
oil can only get higher. For the
sake of oil corporations, as well as
countries like Mexico and Nigeria,
who currently suffer from the low
price of crude oil, the price of oil
has to increase.

While Exxon and Mobil repre-
sent half of the former Standard
Oil empire, splintered by the U.S.
Supreme Court in 1911, their
merger will not establish them as a
monopoly. Combined, Exxon
Mobil will control only a quarter
of the oil market. It still faces huge
corporations such as Texaco,
British Petroleum, Shell and Total.

The merger trend does appear
to be continuing though, as British
Petroleum Co. Ltd. is proposing to
purchase Amoco Oil Co. for $48
billion early next year. Exxon
Mobil Corp. is setting a dangerous
precedent, but for the moment, in
order to sustain a narrow, let alone
a healthy proﬁt, the merger is nec-

essary.

Newt Gingrich’s “Contract with
America” was always more of a contract
with a company union. You know the sort of
thing — one of those fake organizations set
up by the boss’ stool pigeons to “represent”
you at the bargaining table. Gingrich’s suc-
cessor, Bob Livingston, has breathed new
life into this analogy by crossing a picket
line of ABC technicians in order to appear
on the show “This Week.” Even Al Gore —
a stalwart of the anti—labor Democratic
Leadership Council — has refused to
appear on ABC, yet Livingston still knows
no shame.

No doubt, the ghost of America’s most
beloved Nazi sympathizer and Hollywood
fink for the House Un-American Activities
Committee smiled down on the scene. After
all, the many-tentacled monstrosity that
Walt Disney has bequeathed to
the world has long since swal-
lowed up ABC. One of its
appendages sucks the lifeblood
from Haitian workers making
Disney paraphernalia for 19 cents
an hour, while another locks out technicians
at its TV network, simultaneously sustain-
ing the unfortunately long-lived careers of
the likes of George Will,
Stephanopoulos and Ted Koppel.

Count the National Labor Relations
Board as another of the monster’s servile
attendants. It ruled that the company’s lock-
out was legal because the workers had
staged a surprise one-day job action. It is at
moments like these that one stands back in
sheer stupefaction and wonders when the
NLRB will abandon its contrived position
of “mediator” and simply declare unions
illegal.

For obvious reasons, I have not watched
“This Week” for some time. However, the
one or two pre—strike episodes of which I
caught a glimpse were truly amazing in that
the show had actually managed to go down-
hill. The welcome retirement of David
Brinkley has merely led to the ascendancy
of Sam Donaldson and Cokie Roberts, per-
haps the media’s most stunning examples of
establishment arrogance.

Sawyer of ABC’s “Prime Time Live” when

the show attacked the Children’s Disability
program. Donaldson and Sawyer claimed
that disabled poor children were defrauding
the Treasury, and the report lent an impetus
to the passage of the welfare bill signed by
Bill Clinton in August 1996. Among the
victims were some 150,000 disabled chil-
dren who were removed from the rolls.

Millionaire Donaldson continues to col-
lect $97,000 per year in federal subsidies
for his New Mexico sheep ranch.

Regarding Roberts, it is possible to go
on for some time, although I fear exceeding
my vitriol quota for this column. This walk-
ing conﬂict of interest and author of the tau-
tologically titled “We Are All Our Mothers’
Daughters” describes so many of the
Washington politicians she purports to
cover as “very dear friends” that it is a won-
der her ethical vacuity does not
set off alarm bells even in the
depraved universe of TV network
news. Nuclear industry giants
General Electric and
Westinghouse have on occasion
put up the cash for her staggeringly high
speaker’s fees, earning Roberts the dubious
distinction of having been on the payroll of
the owners of all three major TV networks.
An achievement worthy of the “joumalist”
who once faked a broadcast “from Capitol
Hill” by donning an overcoat and standing
in front of an electronic backdrop of the
Capitol.

“This Week” has also become the
stomping ground of Bill Kristol, a man
clueless enough to believe that having been
an assistant to Dan Quayle redounds to his
credit. Kristol’s ABC paychecks help him
keep the “Weekly Standard” aﬂoat, which
in turn allows him to provide a badly need-
ed magazine job to John Podhoretz, that
other talent—free hellspawn of a well-known
neoconservative. These guys give a new
and twisted meaning to the word “solidari-
ty.”

It’s all in a week’s work for
Disney/ABC, although nowadays all of that
work is being done by scabs.

Ruminations on c: lost SGB election

Gerald Bergen

Columnist

Iwenttoanakedbeachpartytoget
votes.

I had 300 people who had no idea who
I was sign my petition. And I got to use a
staple hammer to tack up my “Who is the
real Gerald M. Bergen?” campaign posters
across campus.

Along with routers and other assorted
power tools, staple hammers are fun for the
loud satisfying thwack! thwacld they make
as they pound staples into message kiosks.
Which means your message will stay there
until Armageddon.

But all the staple hammers in the world
couldn’t help me as I lost my rim for the
Student Government Board with a resound-
ing landslide against me. One person, in an
attempt to console me on my loss, said that,
in effect, Icame in 12th place out of 14,646
eligible undergraduates. Which is a com-
forting idea, but a loss is a loss is still an
“also  But that does not mean that I did-
n’t learn anything from my experience as
the “lone candidate.”

I found out that speaking of life’s
adversities and about being evicted doesn’t
play to freshmen living in dorms and does
not a platform make. I formd out that a
select cabal of campus groups called “The
Chosen Ones” control the election process
and events on campus ranging from the
price of textbooks in the bookstore, the lot-
tery for dorm selection and the refusal of the
administration to put doors on the stalls in
the Cathedral’s second-ﬂoor men’s bath-
room.

And I discovered the diﬂiculty of pick-
ing a campaign slogan. Among those con-
sidered: “Gerald M. Bergen: He’ll win your
heart,” “Gerald M. Bergen: Let the
Desecration Begin!” and “Gerald M.

Bergen: He’H kick your 

Success, someone once wrote, has
many fathers. But failure is a orphan. To be
honest, I felt like Mickey Rooney at the end
of “Boys Town,” with Spencer Tracy
extending his hand and saying “You have a
life in Boys Town now.” Or something like
that

The pure light of tmth usually punches
holes in any campaign, and so I purposeful-
ly limited my promises so —- to borrow
from Confucius — I wouldn’t promise any-
thing the night before that I couldn’t deliver
the next moming. But silly me, politics are
supposed to tell you little lies about how
much taller you’ll be, how much whiter
your teeth will become, and how you’ll all
get elected homecoming kings and queens
if you’ll vote for the person in question.

I believe my problem was saying that
the students in general would pretty much
stay the same and L with my “sasquatchian”
proportions of 6-foot—5, 250 pounds, would
still be bigger than most.

It was mentioned in The Pitt News that
on election night I sat alone in the back of
the SGB oﬂice and then left a few minutes
after the first results were called. This is
true; however, it did not say that I then went
down two ﬂoors to The Pitt News oﬂice and
read the New York Times and talk to every-
body who was watching “Dawson’s
Cree ” I did this because while I was sitting
alone, I remembered the story of George C.
Scott and the 1970 Academy Awards.

Scott was a virtual lock for the Best
Actor Oscar for his role in “Patton.” Every
single pundit, every single person with
weight in Hollywood said that he was a
shoo-in. Yet Scott decided not to accept the
award. So when his name was called _in
front of the audience at the Hollywood
Palladium and the television viewers world-
wide, Scott was at home dressed in a beat-

up sweatshirt watching hockey.

Itcarnetomeatthatpointtlrattlrere
was no way, short of riﬂing the ballot
machines and inserting my name onto every
ballot, that I could change the result. I was
either going to win or lose, and for those
readers who know of the “Schrodinger’s
cat” paradox, I was in an unusual state of
neither winning not losing: a state of quan-
tum ﬂux. In short, I was slowly going
insane. So I left before it spread

I eventually found out I lost after the
ﬂood of election groupies ﬁled away to the
elevators to socialize at The Chosen Ones’
“You won and they lost!” theme party. The
next day, I made the standard concessionary
rounds of “congratulations” to the winners,
and they closed the topic with the standard
winning gambit of “You put up a very tough
ﬁght.” I wish my former opponents all the
luck in the world for the success for their
platfomrs. But please don’t forget us crotch-
ety losers. There’s a grain of truth in what
we had to say, you know.

I’d now like to end my column with a
small foray into poetry. I wrote this piece
last December, right before I transferred to
Pitt from Allentown College. New I ﬁnd it
strangely prescient.

Abrasive bombast lacks maturity and ethics

Tony Oliva

Columnist

Today I am being forced to defend
myself against a slanderous attack at the
hands of one John Lacny in his Nov. 23 arti-
cle, “Hell is other Pitt News columnists.”

Let me start by saying that I have never,
in any of my articles, personally bashed
another writer for his viewpoints. I would
handle it in a more professional and mature
way by attacking his views by countering
witlrmy own. Thisappearsnottobethe
case with Lacny. He not only attacked me
personally, but he also lambasted Phoenix
Editor in Chief Paul Clark, Pitt News
columnist Mark Campbell and an un-
named Pitt News artist whose only “crime”
was drawing a picture Lacny thought was
“vaguely neo-Nazi.”

His half—cocked attack has turned a
writer whose colurrms I enjoyed reading
into nothing more than a bully who feels
like using scare tactics in order to stop me

and people like me from voicing opinions.
On many points in his colurrms I found
numerous areas to disagree, but I never
madeapersonal attackonhim. Itiscalled
journalistic integrity and maturity. "lhese
were the major qualities lost in his Nov. 23
article. Not to mention something he proba-
bly doesn’t care about  my respect.

AllI’m sayingisthatiflacny was truly
torturedbywhatIhadwritteninmyNov. 2
article (“Can you spare some sense?”), then
he should have written a rebuttal (like
Elizabeth Bowen’s Nov. 17 column, “Even
panhandlers deserve respect”) countering
with his viewpoints rather than trying to
scare me into no longer voicing my opin-
ions. It will be a cold day in hell when a
Stalin warmabe is going to intimidate me
into backing down.

Let me say that I am no neo-Nazi. I
believe that that label from Lacny was the
most hurtful and ﬁnal straw. I despise what
the Nazis stood for and who they were. I
praythattheatrocitiesthattookplacewill

never happen again. Never again. Some
may criticize my right—wing viewpoints.
and if they wish to argue philosophy with
me, that is all right, but I refuse to let per-
sonal attacks such as I..acny’s go unan-
swered.

Let me ﬁnish by saying that you should
not let people such as John Lacny intimidate
you. Do not be afraid to be different. Martin
Luther King Jr. was different. Nelson
Mandela, Arthur Ashe, Rosa Parks and all
those who would not stand by and be told
what they thought was wrong were differ-
ent. I will not dishonor them by not standing
up for what I believe in.

I’ll stand hard when abstract threats too
noble to neglect try deceiving me into think-
ingIhavesometlringtoprotect.Donot
accept being forced to sit in the back of the
bus. Rosa Parks wouldn’t.

Hoops pontifications
and predictions for

1998-99

It’s time for the start of college
basketball season. Let’s look into
the crystal ball for some predic-
tions.

The Big East Conference will
surprise some people with its
strength this season. Connecticut
will remain in the top five the
entire season. I see the Huskies
winning this conference, with St.
John’s taking a close race for sec-
ond, ahead of Pitt and Syracuse.
Pitt’s Vonteego Cummings will
shock the favorites Tim James and
Richard Hamilton for conference
Player of the Year. Cummings will
be joined on the All-Big East first
team by Pitt forward Isaac
Hawkins.

The Atlantic Coast Conference
will be strong, as usual. Duke,
North Carolina and Maryland all
have legitimate Final Four teams.
I’m taking the Terrapins in an upset
to win the conference, but Duke’s
Elton Brand is player of the year.
Look out for N.C. State. This year’s
Wolfpack squad reminds me of the
1983 team that upset Houston to
win the NCAA title.

The Big Ten Conference can be
summed up in two words: Mateen
Cleaves. Michigan State’s guard is
one of the best players in the coun-
try. He will lead the Spartans to
their second consecutive title and
to a No. 1 seed in the NCAA
Tournament. The team to watch in
the Big Ten is Ohio State. The
Buckeyes are very young, but they
do have Michael Redd and
Schoonie Penn. Last season, Redd
led all freshmen in scoring, while
Penn sat out a year after transfer-
ring from Boston College, where he
was Big East Freshman of the Year.

Kentucky is still the team to

beat in the Southeastern
Conference. I have heard a lot of
people making noise about

Tennessee and Arkansas, among
others, challenging the Wildcats,
but until they lose, I’m not picking
against them. However, I am pick-
ing UT’s Tony Harris to be the
Player of the Year in the confer-
ence.

Tim Young will be the PAC 10
Player of the Year, and he will lead
Stanford to the conference title.

The first half ended with the
Panthers behind 37-23, and the
Buckeyes didn’t slow down in the sec-
ond half.

They outscored the Panthers 38-17
and finishing with a 75-40 victory over
Pitt.

Alecia Balich led the Panthers
with 11 points, and

Nickeia Morris fol-
lowed with 10.
Kortni Webb con-

tributed nine rebounds
to a team total of 37,
and Morris had all
three of the team’s
blocks.

The Lady Panthers had
18 field goals but made
only one of six free-
throw attempts.

Ohio State’s Laura
Shenk led her team
with 16 points, 12 of
them coming from the
three-point line.
Despite the loss to the
Buckeyes, the Panthers
managed to push the
Richmond Spiders out
of their web with a 69-
66 win on Nov. 24.
The Lady Panthers
were behind in the first
half by a score of 33-

40, but they put the pressure on the
Spiders in the second half, coming out
strong with a 22-6 run on Richmond
and holding them without a field goal
for more than seven minutes.

.With a little more than two min-
utes left, the Panthers had a 63-53 lead
over the Spiders. But Richmond
attacked with a rally bringing them
within one point of the Panthers at 67-
66.

Richmond had one more shot to tie
the game with an inbounds play under
its basket, but the 1.3 seconds remain-
ing on the clock was not enough time
for the Spiders to pull of the shot.

Kortni Webb had a season high of
10 rebounds, while Nickeia Morris
added an additional 10 rebounds to go
along with her 15 points.

Monique Toney also helped out
with her 14 points, and together, the
Women sank a total of 28 ﬁeld goals
and ﬁve three-point shots.

The Panthers managed to bring
down a total of 38 rebounds and put up
six blocks.

Once again, the team was not as
strong with the free throws, putting
away only eight out of 20 shots in the
game

The statistics show a pretty even
game between the two teams, but in
the end, Pitt pushed harder to earn the
win.

Poteat, Grim and Clarke earn postseason honors

Patrick Robertson
Sports Edttor

Receiver Latef Grim and defen-
sive back Hank Poteat earned first
team All-Big East honors this week.

Grim led Pitt’s offense this year.
He especially made an impact at the
beginning of the year, when the
Panthers were without last season’s
leading receiver, Terry Murphy.

Poteat led Pitt on defense and spe-
cial teams. He helped the Panther
defense to a No. 9 national ranking in
the first few weeks of the season and
returned kicks and punts for Pitt.

Linebacker Phil Clarke garnered a
second-team distinction this year,
despite being injured for the last three
games of the season.

Grim missed one game after a
vicious hit against Boston College but
was able to return for Pitt’s last con-
test.

Grim is a sophomore who trans-
ferred last year from San Joaquin
Delta (Calif.) College.

Grim caught 60 balls for 906
yards and nine touchdowns. His sea-
son catch total is second on Pitt’s all-
time list behind only Jake Hoffart,
who set the mark last year with 69
catches.

Grim’s yardage ranks third in
Pitt’s record books.

Poteat, a junior, led the nation in
interceptions for most of the season
before trailing off at the end.

He is tied for third now with an
average of 0.6 takeaways per game.

On special teams, Poteat ranked
fifth in the conference with 21.2 yards
per kick return and 8.2 yards per punt
return.

Clarke had a disappointing senior
campaign because of his injury. He
had 61 tackles, including seven for a
loss and two sacks.

Latef Grim made the All-Big East first team.

Pitt swimmer suffers punctured lung and tells his story

Craig Peterson

Staff Writer

Editor's note: The following is
swimmer Craig Peterson’s personal
account of a rare, serious injury he
sustained during last year's swimming
season.

Even though it has been more than
a year since I last felt the heaviness in
my lungs and the stabbing pain in my
neck that threatened to end my swim-
ming career, I can still recall it all quite
vividly.

Swimming was not supposed to be
a dangerous sport.

Swimming was not supposed to be
a sport in which one could suffer

strange injuries that only a handful of
people in the entire world have ever
had, but there I was ﬁghting for every
breath I took. Fighting to remain in a
sport that I had loved since age 4.

And when I woke up one Saturday
last fall to go to swim practice I did not
expect to be fearing for my own life by
the day’s end.

As head coach Chuck Knoles came
out and told us to start swimming, I
and the rest of the team made our way
over to the water’s edge for yet anoth-
er long and tedious practice. The water
in the pool is very cold, especially
when you first jump in and especially
on an early Saturday morning when
you really don’t feel like diving in at

all.

“That’s the life of a swimmer,” as
my club coach Al Rose would say.
“Now get in the water!”

Practice was going as usual for me
— I felt terrible, tired and sore until
about the last half hour or so, when my
muscles‘ ﬁnally decided to wake up
and get moving. As usual, I found
myself struggling to make even the
easiest of sets, those of the warm—up
variety.

My teammates and I were in the
middle of a fairly challenging set of 16
200—yard freestyle heats, where the
main objective was to swim in and out
of each turn under water.

Now, I never was the best at hold-

.* ' ‘

ing my breath for long periods of time,
but because the coach had made the set
so challenging, I was really pushing it
hard to make the given interval. On the
eighth 200, I felt a sharp pain in the
right side of my neck.

Cramps are nothing new to swim-
mers. We usually swim entire practices
in pain and soreness. My neck was no
different. I continued swimming,
thinking it was no more than a small,
insigniﬁcant kink in my neck.

As practice continued and the
yardage began to increase, so did the
pain in my neck. I remember in partic-
ular a set toward the end of practice
that was meant to be a warm—down. As
I swam easily, I began to notice that I
was laboring harder to make the send-
off times, in addition to the ever-
increasing neck pain that I had felt for
more than an hour now.

I got out of the pool and headed for
the locker room, not really thinking
about my neck.

As I was driving home, my neck
seemed unusually stiff, and I began to
realize the pain I was feeling was more
than a neck cramp. That’s when I start-
ed to worry.

When I got home, I told my par-
ents that my neck hurt and that I’d had
trouble breathing. After a short confer-
ence, we decided it would be best for
me to go to the local emergency room.

After various X-rays and examina-
tions, the doctors could confirm only
two things. First, there was a large
pocket of air trapped in my neck, and
second, I needed to see a specialist
because they had no idea what it was
or how they should go about treating it.

This was what I consider now,
looking back, to be the worst week of
my young life.

My ﬁrst stop of endless appoint-
ments was Monday at Presbyterian
University Hospital. I was again X-
rayed from a thousand different angles
until I practically glowed in the dark.

Wednesday, I was off to
Monteﬁore Hospital, where I took a
series of breath-analysis tests. I was
hooked up to what appeared to be an
oxygen mask with a cardboard tube at
the end. The technician told me to

. blow as hard as I could so my air

intake could be measured.

On Thursday morning, I went to
Presbyterian again, this time for a CT
scan, the ﬁnal, all-knowing test. While
under the CT scan, I was to have an IV
hooked up to my arm dripping a spe-
cial chemical into my blood stream.
This chemical would show up on the
CT scan X—ray type results, and the
doctors would know exactly what had
happened.

When I was taken to the CT scan
room a nurse hooked me up to the IV

Swlm, page 9

THURSDAY, 3 DECEMBER 1998

SWIM

and told me what was going to happen
as the scan was going on. She did not,
however, tell me that the chemical
being dripped into my blood would
make me feel as if my entire body was
on fire.

I had thought that my neck pain
was the worst pain I had ever experi-
enced. It was not; this IV drip was.
Never in my life have I felt so hot. The
sensation actually took my breath
away, and the room began to get dark
as my vision faded.

The CT scan concluded my week-
long marathon of examinations, and
from the result, the doctors were final-
ly able to give me a diagnosis.

In medical terms, it was called
spontaneous pneumomediastinum. An
extremely rare and difficult injury to
identify, in laments, terms it meant that
one of the many little sacs of air that
make up the wall of a my lung had
popped. This forced-out air then
became trapped in my neck, causing
my severe pain and shortness of
breath.

The condition is so rare that there
have been only 25 reported cases, most
occurring in tall, athletic men. The
condition happens randomly, and the
doctor assured me that there would be
little chance of a relapse. The doctor
said I should sit out another few days
of swimming to let the puncture heal
completely.

That weekend was our big home
dual meet against Syracuse, our main
competition in the Big East
Conference. Since I was still unable to
swim, all I could do was watch as my
teammates swam their best to beat our
archenemies.

Practice resumed that Monday,
and I can remember only one thing
about it: I was terribly rusty and even
a little out of shape. While I was swim-
ming in that practice, I thought about a
poster I have hanging on my wall in
my room. It says: “They say man can
survive five days without water. But
not if he’s on the swim team.”

I understood that poster a lot more
after that practice.

Things didn’t go as smoothly as
expected after that ﬁrst day back, and
swimming became a struggle. While
the rest of the team was in tip-top
shape, I was constantly trying to get
back in shape. I was always extremely
tired. I began to feel as if I would
never regain my prior form, and my
confidence began to sink. Each time I

FROM PAGE 8

THE Prrr Nzws

jumped in the water, I feared for my
well—being. I knew it was silly to
worry about my lung because the doc-
tor had even said there was no risk of
harming myself again. Still, I couldn’t
get it out of my mind. No matter what
I did, no matter what I thought about,
it was always looming over me.

My confidence was shaky, and in
swimming, confidence is important to
swimming fast. Swimming became
work, not enjoyment, as it had been in
the past. I left with a bad feeling about
the season, and I was not at all satis-
fied with my results.

I knew I had to do something to
bring my mind back into swimming,
but I wasn’t quite sure what that was.
It wasn’t until I began swimming with
my club team, the JCC Sailfish, in late
April that I began to realize what had
been missing.

When I first started back with the
Sailfish, it was because I wanted to
stay in shape and train for U. S.
National Championships in August. I
trained hard every day just as I did at
Pitt, praying that I could regain my
past form, move on, and continue to
improve over the summer. But still, I
was having no luck.

I finally decided to stop putting
pressure on myself and just have fun
with my teammates. Every week, I
simply focused on having fun and pro-
ductive workouts instead of always
thinking I needed to do more workouts
to catch up to where I had been. My
teammates and I did things other than
swimming together. They were simple
things like going to breakfast, catching
a movie, or celebrating a teammate’s
birthday, which didn’t seem like
important events at the time, but as I
look back, I realize they helped me to
love swimming again.

Soon my swimming began to
improve, and my times did eventually
return to where they had been before. I
went to nationals in Clovis, Calif., in
August and placed 41st in the country
in the 200 individual medley. For the
first time in a long time, I was satisfied
with how things had gone, and for the
first time that summer, I was looking
forward to the coming school year.

After all of this, I realized some
things about being a swimmer. The
exhilaration, satisfaction and pride of
achieving are a swimmer’s goals and
rewards. I realize now that when I was
lying in emergency room last year, my
greatest fear was that I would never
again be able to experience the gifts
that swimming gives to me every time
I jump in the water.

 N FROM PAGE 7

The Cardinal will be challenged by
Steve Lavin‘s UCLA Bruins. but
Stanford is just too strong.

Look out for Oklahoma State in
the Big 12. They will beat the
Kansas Jayhawks to end KU‘s run
of conference titles. Roy Williams
took a big hit when he lost Raef
Lafrentz and Paul Pierce to the
NBA. a decision which Pierce is
likely to be regretting right now.

Jayhawk guard Ryan Robertson
will flourish now that he is the
scorer of the system, and he will
take the Player of the Year award.

OK, here are the four No. 1
seeds for the NCAA Tournament.
First, Connecticut in the East.

In the Southeast, Tubby Smith
and the Kentucky Wildcats. In the
Midwest, Michigan State will be
the top dog. Stanford is No. 1 in the
West.

The Final Four this year will be
held at the Tropicana Dome in St.
Petersburg, Fla., and it will feature
these four squads. First, the Kansas
Jayhawks.

Kansas will be a No. 2 seed in
the West, and it will upset Stanford.
The next team will be Maryland.
The Terps will come from the third
seed in the Midwest to make it. The
other two teams will be top seeds
UConn and Kentucky.

The championship game on
March 29 will feature the Maryland
Terrapins against the Kentucky
Wildcats.

When the final buzzer sounds,
coach Tubby Smith and the Cats
will be celebrating their second
straight title.

The All—America team at the
end of the year will not be changed
much from the preseason team.

The team will consist of Duke’s
Brand, Texas Christian University’s
Lee Nailon, Cleaves, Utah’s Andre
Miller and Pitt’s Vonteego
Cummings.

The national Player of the Year
will be Cleaves, but after another
disappointing NCAA Tournament,
he’ll decide to return for another
shot with coach Tom Izzo and the
Spartans.

Cleaves’ decision to return to
school will ensure that NBA com-
missioner David Stern will open the
1999 NBA draft with this state-
ment:

“With the first pick in the 1999
NBA Draft, the Philadelphia 76ers
select, from the University of
Pittsburgh, guard Vonteego
Cummings."

Mario Mac/zi is a columnist for
The Pitt News and invites its read-
ers to peer into the crystal ball with
him anytime.
