AFROTC Plan

Chancellor Edward Litch-
ﬁeld has approved a plan
which will permit ‘ senior
AFROTC students to receive
35 hours of ﬂight instruction
free. A

Since most trainees can solo for
their private flying license after
only 10 hours of flight instruction,
this will mean that those eligible
for the program will have the
beneﬁt of advanced training be-
fore entering an Air Force flight
school.

’When the program goes into
effect only those seniors who are
classiﬁed for a commission in
Category I will receive the in-
struction. This category i: for
those who will enter ﬂight school
upon graduation and receiving
their commission.

Those who are in Category IA,
navigation; Category II, engineer-
ing; and Category III, administra-
tive, will not receive the training.
A later development of the pro-
gram might open it to Category

‘  IA cadets.

The program will be ﬁnanced
by the University, administered
by a staﬂ officer of the AFROTC
detachment, and will contract a
civilian agency at either Butler
or Greater Pittsburgh Airports for
the actual instruction.

ed to chapel services at noon

will recognize and is especially

Glve Oplnlons 1n Poll
' By ROSALIE GLAND
“I’ll believe it when I see it.” This was the way many

Pitt students reacted during the past ‘year when they read
accounts in the‘ Pitt News concerning the progress of the

Student Union.

The ancient adage “Seeing is believing,” was proven
last Monday when the main ﬂoor of the Union was open to

give the student body a “preview
of coming attractions.”

Students who attended the pre-
view saw the Terrace Lounge, the
Linner Lounge, and the Ballroom.

Their comments ranged from
“Wow” to “Gosh!” Many were
speechless. However, a few stu-
dents were able to ﬁnd adequate
words to express themselves when
asked to present their impressions
and reactions to the Student Un-
ion. Such comments as the follow-
ing typify the reactions:

Harry Chick, Eng. ’58—“It’s
great. This is something we can
really call our own. We can study,
talk, or just lounge. There’s none
of the restrictions of the libraries.
The atmosphere is very restful.”

Marcia Depew, Col. ’59-—“It will
enrich and enliven the social as-
pects of the University by bring-
ing the students closer together.”

Mike Higgins, Bus. Ad. ’58—
“This restful atmosphere is quite a
contrast from the hubub and
smoke of the tuck shops.”

Vange Metros, Col. ’57—-“It’s
luxurious, but not so much that it
is distracting.”

Paul Palombo, Col. ’57——“I am
very pleased with the Union. If
students don’t sacrifice grades in
favor of lounging here, it will be

-» great. It will add to the prestige

and integrity of every student. It’s
something to Show off to our par-
ents, our friends, and the com-
munity.”

John F. Wyble, Col. ’60——“I
went for one semester to another
university whose student union
is considered tops. They nicknam-
ed it the “ping pong place.” I’d
pick our Union over their’s any-
time. It has everything their’s has
and one thing more-dignity.”

Arlene Russel, Col. '60-“We
certainly need this. It makes Pitt
seem more like a campus school.
It will do much to promote unity
among the students because it

gives us a common meeting
ground.” ,
Stephanie Jonson, Col. ’58--“I

‘know it will help raise the stu-

for the commuters who usually go
home right after classes. Now
they have some place to relax be-
fore, between, and after classes.”

Barbara Bloomﬁeld, Col. ’60-—
“Here we can escape the tensions
of the Cathedral of Learning with
its ground ﬂoor crowds and eleva-
tor frustrations. We can even es-
cape the noise of city trafﬁc. I’m
glad I have three more years to
enjoy it.” ‘

Dr. Charles H. Peake, assistant
chancellor of Student‘ Affairs
stated that the grand, formal
opening of the Union will take
place in the Fall at which time

LANGUAGE MADE SIMPLE: No. 2

Exams loom closer and closer. The sands run out; the -
chips are down. This, you will agree, is no time for levity.

Accordingly, I have asked the makers of Philip Morris
whether I might not dispense with jesting, in today’s col-
umn and instead devote it to a cram course in languages.

Their consent was cheerfully given, for they are ﬁne,
great-hearted men, the makers of Philip Morris, just as
full of natural goodness as the cigarettes they turnout, ,
just as friendly, just as jolly, just as regular, j_ust as un-

, ﬁltered, just as agreeable. “Why, bless you, child!" cried

the makers. “Of course!” Then they rumpled my chest-

into our trundle beds and slept the clock around! -

But I digress. Today let us turn‘ our attention to the
study of languages. -

Do you realize how important languages are? I must.

confess that, until recently, I did not. “What good will ‘

Spanish ever do me ?” I kept asking.

Well sir, I found out. Recently I took a trip to Latin
America, and every day I thanked my lucky stars for
having learned Spanish in college. While my fellow tour-
ists stumbled and humbled, I was perfectly at home.

’ There should have been one more trophy handed out
at the Metropolitan Ball on Saturday night. It should have
been awarded for the “Best. Timing of a Demonstration in
Democratic Education.” It should have been presented to
Kappa Nu and Omega Psi Phi. , s -»

At a time when the Governor of the state of Pennsyl-
vaniaris censuring school districts for practicing segrega-
tion, these two fraternities have proved the depth of this
University’s policies on segregation.

W _ While the? KN and Omega’ Psi show was something

’ itferent in its presentation, it wasnot ‘treatediby Uni-

‘ iversity students as anything conspicuous enough for spe-
cial attention. ‘It was Americanly treated -as a natural hap-
pening on the.Pitt campus. It is this “matter of fact” atti-
tude‘ whichirnakes the lesson taught by these two groups
that much ~more effective. "

Too often any practices of those policies which are said

. to be the natural ,‘‘American Way” are given such atten-
tion" and treated as such unusual occurrences that it would
seem to point outthat occasionssuch as ‘those are extreme-

. ly ra_re in this democratic nation. ’ _ ,

.The‘University. stated its policy last fall in a ﬁrm but
well worded"statement_ on the refusal to dignify racial
bans in athletic events taking place in certain southern

states. Pennsylvania has always been uniquely located on.

the Mason-Dixon line’ and has maintained policies as a
state that were aslﬁrm anduncompromising as any in the
~~ "New England‘ area on the "outlawing of segregation.

Within the state‘, however, the policies were not al-
ways followed as exempliﬁed in the current haggle ‘over
segregated schools. In the University the Negro students

‘have never tested the ‘practice of the anti-segregation

policy. iThey have, in effect, held off in the Tuck Shops

., desiring no overt test of what everyone took for granted.

Becauseof these two practices, there was no room to doubt

that there was real practice of ‘integration in the Uni-
versity and ether state. ,

The recent cooperation and closely allied effort put forth
by Omega Psi and KN have proven what Pitt students
knew all along. The natural homogeniety of the Negro
students in Tuck Shops can no more be called as evidence
of segregationby Negro or White than can the other things
that cause certain fraternities and sororities to associate

Liberal Arts Grads . . .

Job Opportunities

(Editor’s Note: This is the second‘ of two
columns by Walter M. Ritenour, assistant director
of the Placement Bureau, concerning job oppor-

tunities for the Liberal Arts graduate.)

By Walter M. Ritenour

I would like to enumerate four ﬁelds of activity
in the business world where we have had consider-
able success in placing liberal arts graduates. They
are retailing, industrial sales, insurance, and bank-
ing.

The chain stores and large downtown depaTt-
ment stores are literally crying for college grad-
uates, and we are unable to supply the market.
They all have management trainee programs in
which they are trying to develop future store man-
agers. Starting salaries are in the neighborhood of

I $350.00 per month. Many have_ proﬁt sharing plans

which provide handsomeretirement incomes, and
all‘ of them have liberal fringe beneﬁts. They are
open on Saturdays and some evenings, and those
who go into the selling end of the business must be
able to stand up under pressure.

However, the ﬁnancial rewards are great, some
buyers make over $40,000 a year, but I have ob-
served that onynne who makes more than $5000 per
year in any occupation is likely to work more than
40 hours per week. If you have your heart in the
job I clon’t think you mind the long hours, and if
you don't like your job ,then 35 hburs per week will
seem like an eternity. New Suburban stores which
‘are springing up will need managers and buyers.
At least consider retailing before you brush it- aside
for ﬁve days a week and all evenings free.

Until very recently an engineering education
has been required for industrial sales. However,

many great companies have discovered that the

liberal arts graduate often makes a good salesman,

“and that he can draw on technical personnel when

the need arises. Consequently they have been re-
cruiting liberal arts people, and interviewed many
of them on our campus this spring. Other com-
panies are interested in liberal arts people for in-
dustrial sales, if they show evidence of aptitiude in
sales.

Insurance Rewarding

' Every week there are at least three insurance
company representatives on campus looking for
personnel for sales, mathematics majors for actuar-
ial work, and promising people for the administra-
tive end of the business either in an agency office
in Pittsburgh or in one of the home offices. Experi-
ence shows that many people who reject insurance
as a career early in life, later ﬁnd that it can be a
rewarding career. It can provide the independence

- that few careers with giant corporations can offer.

Once established you have an equity in your busi-
ness which is protected by contract law, and each
year that you remain in the business _you have a
larger and larger income from the renewal prem-
iums in addition to the business you sell.

If you are sensitive about asking your friends
to buy insurance, remember that the same man
who regards you as a pest today will later worship
you as the saviour of his family if he has a long
illness, or a disastrous automobile wreck, and his
family will regard you as a saintif the man to

_ whom you sold that unwanted life insurance sud-

denly dies and leaves a widow with young chil-

-dren. The American people are sold on insurance

and you do not have to be a high pressure artist to
make a good living selling insurance.

During the 1930’s the banks of America were
not in a position, to hire many people, during the
40's there were very few people available, and dur-
ing the 50's the banks lagged behind in salaries and
fringe beneﬁts. Now they ﬁnd themselves with
aging executives and they are now vigorously re-
cruiting college graduates.
Deal With People

They are interested in the liberal arts graduate
because so much of their work involves dealing with
people, and the true liberal arts graduate should be
adept in that ﬁeld. At least two local banks recruit
on campus and grant interviews at any time during

Possible Problem . .

the school year. Branch banking is expanding at an
enormous rate and the banks are on the lookout for
future branch managers.

I will admitthat men have more opportunities
in the.business ﬁelds that I have discussed, with the
exception of retailing where women compete on
equal terms and often hold positions of great re-

sponsibility. Therefore, I would like to close with 3..

brief discussion of three ﬁelds in which women
have almost as many opportunities as men. I refer
to the Foreign Service of the United States, special
librarians, and social work.

Civil service exams will be given here at Pitt
July 13. These tests are not for any speciﬁc govern-
ment job but are geared to show in what fields a
person’s best opportunities lie. Those who qualify
can be placed anywhere in the United States. They
differ from the Federal Service exams which place
workers in Washington, D.C.

The examination for the Foreign Service will be
given on June 24 and wehave applications and

brochures on ﬁle in the Placement Bureau Library.’

The United States has 269 offices all over the
world. These offices employ several thousand per-
sons most of them liberal arts graduates. In the
words of Mr. Carpenter, Assistant Secretary of
State, “the‘ job requires people who have that
peculiar combination of adventurousness, discip-
line, and dedication, which will enable them to
ﬁnd real satisfaction in rendering the maximum
possible service to their country under all kinds of
conditions and in every conceivable type of en-
vironment.’’ There is more about the Foreign Serv-
ice in the pamphlet “Career Opportunities” avail-
able in the Placement Office. C
Library Work Offered ,
There are now 5232 special libraries in the U.S.
where salaries go up to $12,500. There are many
unﬁlled positions in these libraries and you can
prepare for library work right here in Pittsburgh.
Just this week I had a call from a girl who

graduated last June. She was a sociology major and '

now works in the library of one of our local in-
dustries. She ﬁnds it possible to do the work of a
special librarian even though she has not had any
college work in the sciences and reports that her
high school chemistry is invaluable but wishes she
had taken at least one course in college chemistry,
one course in college physics, and one. course in
mathematics. Where. could you ﬁnd better evidence
that a good general education does pay? it

At the present time various social work agencies
are so desperate for personnel that many have
waived the School of Social Work qualiﬁcation and
are interested in good liberal arts graduates. A
‘young man walked into our office the other day
looking for a part time job in physical education
while he attends graduate school. He was a liberal
arts graduate. We placed him in a Boys’ Club at
$3900 a year. The Boy Scouts, Girl Scouts, Y.W.C.A.,
Y.M.C.A. are looking for personnel.

A young women visited our office the other day
looking for a better job. She is a Girl Scout Execu-

tive in Ohio and her salary is $6000 a year.‘The .

State Mental Hospital will start you out at $3560
per year as a Psychiatric social worker and pay
your tuition to graduate school after one year. The
Boys’ Clubs have a special graduate course at New
York University, but they want you to be a liberal
arts graduate first. Many Boys’ Clubs have attrac-

tive and well stocked libraries and they need libra-

rians too.

‘ I will conclude with an opportunity in the his-
tory ﬁeld. The Washington Branch of the Human
Relations Area Files has openings for Research As-
sistants, Research Associates, and Senior Research
Associates at salaries ranging from $4000 to $9000.

May I close with a word of caution, which rei-
terates what I have already said about the liberal
arts graduate. There are plenty of jobs for people
who are truly educated in the liberal arts, but each
person will have to do some hunting until he ﬁnds
the right job for himself. Feel free to call on us at
the Placement Bureau for help at anytime. We will
be open all summer.

Last Monday University stu-
dents had the opportunity of
previewing the sections of the
Student Union that have been
completed thus far. These in-
cluded the Terrace Lounge, the
Inner Lounge, and the" Ball
Room.

The following is not the de-
scription of the two lounges by
an expert on interior decorating,
but it is a general picture of
what the _ rooms contain. The

_Terrace Lounge has both green
, and red sofas,‘ and green, red, ,

black, and white lounge chairs.
The carpeting is of‘the thick
green type. .

Numerous mahogany tables
are located next to most of the
chairs and sofas, and on »the
tables are gold lamps covered

with white shades. Huge marble ’

pillars add to the beauty. For
effect, the lounge has a piano set
back in an alcove at one of the
ends of the large room.

The Inner‘Lounge is smaller,
but still rivals its larger adja-
cent room for beauty. It too is
decorated in red and green. The.
carpet is green with a ﬂowery

. atmosphere .

design, and there are red and

green chairs. Some of the tables

in the smaller lounge are glass-
topped. In both lounges mirrors

cover parts of the walls.

Silence and Study 

The beauty of these sections of
the Union is conducive to silence
and study, the intended use of
the two places. If they are used.
just for study or anything else
that can be done in comparative
silence, it would be a welcome
relief to those who enjoy getting
school work done in a nice, quiet

nTennis Coach Pope Optimistic

For Three Remaining Matches

By HAROLD LEINER

Freshman tennis coach Ben Pope is optimistic over his
team’s chance of ﬁnishing the season with more losses than
wins. Right now the Blue and Gold have won two team

matches while losing three.

And with four matches re-

maining on the schedule, they will have to win at least
three of the four to accomplish this objective.

So far this season the locals‘

have defeated St. Francis of
Loretto, 9-0, and crosstown rival
Duquesne, 7-2, while suffering de-
feats at the hands of Westminster,
5-4, West Virginia, 6-3, and the
powerful Navy team, 9-0.

Although the team looked
rather ragged in their last two
matches with West Virginia and
Navy, Pope feels that his boys,
led by No. 1 man Bill King, will
settle down and play the kind

early August.

 

Some 400 Panther athletes from 13 varsity and freshman
squads will attend the annual A1l—Sports Dinner this Thurs-
day, May 23. The banquet will be held at Webster Hall
and will get under way at 6:30 p.m. A player from each team,

selected by their teammates,

Five of Coach Bobby Lewis’
mittmen are currently socking the
little white pellet around at a bet-
ter than .300 clip. Shortstop Jim
Dunlap, who has still another year
to go, is leading the Panther crew
with a .450 average. Corky Cost,
who this season switched form the
outﬁeld to second base, is hitting
.415; sophomore leftﬁelder Ron
Hoover is at .315; and Joe Walton
and ﬁrst year backstop Fred De-
Lost are even at .300.

Walton has been slugging the
ball the past couple of games the
way he started out the season.
His ﬁfth circuit blast, which
came in the Panthers’ 7-0 vic-
tory over Allegheny last Thurs-
day, was his ﬁrst since April 20-
Walton now leads the local nine
with six four-base blows.

Ed Drapcho, the southpawiwho
will hurl against the Panthers
Saturday, has a phenomenal 24-3

record for three years of Penn
State varsity play. In his sopho-

. more year, the little lefty won ten

out of twelve games. Then last
season he ﬁnished with seven vic-
tories and one loss. He has already
equaled his 1956 win output this
season and still has another two
or three cracks at Lion opponents.

Paul Lazor, brother of the

_of tennis that he knows they are
capable of playing. The play of
King has been outstanding so
far this season, and he was re-
cently voted by his teammates
as the most valuable player on
the team.

After King in individualimatch
play, the locals have No. 2 man
Bob Swaney,_ No. 3 man Don
Isaac, No. 4 man Neal Zweig, No.
5 man Berny Ravish, and No. 6
man Fred Bonebreak. 5

Coach Pope points out that one
of the reasons for his optimism is
that while the Blue and Gold have
a losing record in team play, the
individual match play stands at
23-22 in favor of the locals.

Pope also thought that one
of the reasons for his team’s
showing so far was because of
the late start due to the first
two matches being postponed. -

In the doubles, Popeusually has
No. 1 man King combined with
No. 4 man Zweig as the head duo.
Following them are Swaney and
Isaac as the No. 2. team and Rav-
ish teams with Bonebreak to com-
prise the No. 3 team.

The remaining schedule shows
the locals playing host to West
Virginia on May 22, away at Penn
State on May 25, and the ﬁnal
match will be played at Duquesne
on May 29.

several of their dual meets only to ﬁnd them winning or
being nipped on the last event of the program.

Before the State meet, the Blue
and Gold coach forecast a 67-64
win for the opposition. He was
never taken earnestly until the
Nittany Lions won by just that
score over the Jungle Cats at the
Stadium Saturday.—

It was the Panthers’ second
straight dual meet lossto go with
three earlier triumps.

Broad Jump Decides Meet

The local thinclads came within
41/; inches of downing Coach
Chick Werner’s team. The score
was knotted at 61-61 with only
the broad jump not completed.

Dick Winston, State’s re-
nowned hurdler, had leaped 22
feet, 101/_; inches. The Panthers
had to better this if they were
to take the meet.

Coach Olson sent his No. 1
broad jumper——Al Templin—-
against Winston, but the Panther
ace could not match Winston’s dis-
tance. Templin ﬂoated 22 feet, 6
inches on his ﬁrst jump. He had
two remaining attempts to tie or
beat Winston, but both of them
were too short.

Panthers Take Relay

The Nittany Lions held a ﬁve-
point advantage into the ﬁnal run-
ning event of the day—the mile
relay. The Jungle Cats rallied,
however, on the strength of some
exceptional running by Dick
Doyle, Jay Moody, Zinnerford
Smith, and Charley Heﬂin toptie
the overall team score at 61-61
which set the tempo for the cli-
mactic broad jump.

.Doyl.e matched State’s Ed
‘Moran, who earlier had taken
the half-mile and mile runs,
stride for stride on the ﬁrst lap
of the relay as he gave Moody
a short one-half yard margin
over the Lion’s second runner-
Rod Perry. ,

Moody increased the lead to ten
yards when hehanded the baton
to Smith. Smith then opened an
insurmountable gap of 30 yards
over the visitor’s Dave Nash when
anchor man Charley Heﬂin felt
the. baton being eased into his
back-stretched hand. Heﬂin did
not slow down the pace, ﬁnishing
40 yards ahead of the opposing
anchor man.

Rain Falls

After the first lap of the mile
run, a sudden cloudburst sent the
fans scurrying "for shelter. The
hard rain continued for the re-
mainder of the run, eased up to a
slight drizzle for the 440-yard
dash, before stopping for the re-
mainder of the meet.

When the rain started to fall,
Panther distance men Jim
Moore and Wendell Harford
were grouped with State’s

Moran and Fred Kerr. They
made it close for three and one-
half laps before Moran and
Kerr‘ pulled away for a one-two
ﬁnish. Moran’s winning time
was 4:16.

Each team had one double wiri-
ner in the clashes. State saw Perry
capture -the 120-yard high hurdles
and the 220-yard low hurdles
while the Panther double was re-
corded in the 100—yard dash and
the 220-yard dash by sophmore
Jim Donahue.

Records ..Missed

in :14.3 with teammate Winston
second. Panther Bob Russell
placed third. Perry’s time just
missed the Stadium record of 114.1
set by the Blue and Gold’s. Wally
Monohan against Notre Dame in

of State in 1955.

The low hurdles saw Perry
again ﬁnish . ﬁrst as he nipped
Panther Paul Thrash in :24.2,
again just missing a Stadium
record of :24.1 which was estab-
lished by Bob Maxwell of the
Los Angeles A0 in 1930.

Donahue, like Perry, barely
missed ‘a Stadium record, too,
when he edged teammate) Herb
Carper in the ‘100’ with a clocking
of :09.7. This fell short of the rec-
ognized Stadium time of :09.6\ set
by Eulace Peacock of Temple in
1935 and tied by Art Pollard of
State during the 1955 season.

Doyleiwins ‘440’

Donahue scored his other ﬁrst in
the ‘220’ when he overtook Carper
in the last 50 yards; His winning
time was :21.8.
' The Nittany Lions, besides hav-
ing a double winner in the dashes,
also had one in the distance events
when Moran took the half-mile
and mile runs. Moran covered the
‘880’ in’ 153.8 and the mile in 4:16.
The best the Cats could dogwas a
second in the ‘880’ and a third in
the mile by. Moore.

Dick Doyle, Panther junior
from Erie Strong, won the 440-
yard dash in 48.8. James Nor-
ton of State was second with
Heﬂin third. ,

Vaulting ace Bill Smith was

' held to a tie in the pole vault by

Harry Fuehrer. Each cleared the
bar at 13 feet, 3 inches.

The other ‘field events found
Ron Siemon winning the high,
jump with a jump of 6 feet, 3
inches; State’s John Tullar edg-
ing Larry Och in the shot put;
the Lion’s Richard Coats beating
Templin and Corny Salvaterra in
the javelin; and‘ Tullar besting~
Wess King in the discus for the
only double in the ﬁeld events.

If the Panther mitters hope to ﬁnish the season either

As prospects for the remaining
contests appear, the Jungle Cats
will lose to the Dukes apd drop
one and very possibly a pair to
the Lions. Thus, a victory the day
after tomorrow over the Moun-
ties is a necessity.

the leading hitter for the visitors.

The three military academies swept the ﬁrst four places.

The Panthers took sixth place
with 1328. ‘ .

The Blue and Gold sent a
four-man team to the finals
composed of Earl Se-iber, Jack
Cayton, Stewart Offenbach, and
Robert Haber. Seiber was the
top Cub marksman with a high
of 285. ’

Sergeant Gromko comments,
“Seiber is a ﬁne marksman. His

freshman.”

Freshman teams from universi-
ties all over the nation competed
Qrr a regional basis. After the eli-
minations, the ﬁnals were fired

in a similar manner. The resplts

were tabulated and thenhtitze win-,

Coach Gromko was

against theiacademy teams. This
;~.‘ves him ﬁve men with previous
experience for next year’s vars-‘

The ﬁnal results of the NCAA

awaiting the results as James
Flynn, a senior, has a good
chance for high national honors.
Flynn placed second in the re-
gional meet at Buffalo, N.Y.,
which qualiﬁed him for the
championship. -

The Panther varsity has high
hopes of ﬁelding a top team next
year. Gromko says, “Flynn has a
very good chance for high honors,
and with’a marksman like him we
should do all right next year.”

Uncertain ty arlcs Grid Future

By STEVE BUTCHOCK

Chancellor Edward  Litchﬁeld’s “new era”
administration plans to make the University of
Pittsburgh one of the foremost institutions of

2 learning in the world. Chancellor Litchﬁeld‘ has

outlined a long-range program whereby Pitt will
eventually rank academically with Harvard, Yale,
Princeton, and the other monarchs of higher learn-
ing.

The new administration has compared our
library, tuition rates, entrance requirements, and
instructor’s pay with those at" Harvard and found
them to be inadequate in terms of scholastic great-
ness. The administration has stated that Pitt must
obtain a similar status in these problem areas if it
is to achieve scholarly greatness.

It may come as a surprise, a shock, or
both, but if Pitt is going to be ranked academi-
”c'ally with Harvard, we almost certainly have

’ to be ranked athletically with Harvard. 'I‘here’s
an old maxim that whenever the faculty steps
into the athletic picture, the new ﬁt is always a
little tight. How tight Pitt becomes appears to
depend on how tight the administration wants 9

2 it to become. 1

The only valid and reasonable conclusion that
can be drawn so far is that Skyscraper U. Will
eventually degenerate from athletic greatness to
athletic mediocrity. The hardest hit sport is likely
«to be football and it could bedoomed sooner than
one thinks. M

For the past two years Pitt has had great foot-
ball teams under the athletic administration of
Athletic Director Tom Hamilton and «the ﬁeld lead-
ership of Coach John Michelosen. These two ath-
letic ﬁgures have seen their grid teams selected
for post-season bowl games in both 1956 and,19.57
after posting 7-3 and 7-2-1' records during the reg-
ular seasons. Pitt has been proud of these teams
and they have won admiration for their clean play
and sportsmanship both on and off the ﬁeld.»

Coach Michelosen will probably have an-
otherstrong team this Fall. Chances are good ,
that the Panthers will pull a few upsets and
equal their records of the past two seasons.
After the 1957 ‘season though, the Panther grid

future does not look too bright unless more top-
notch high school stars are legally recruited.

The one question raised here is how‘ can Pitt,
after a drastic and much-needed upgrading of
academic standards, continue to’, be represented in
big-time football with such grid powers ‘as _\Qkla-L

Sends Letter to Murrow

Cook Sees Great Game
Most of the local football interest will be focused on
the Pitt-Oklahoma football scrap at the Stadium next Sep-
tember 21 when Coach John Michelosen’s Panthers attempt
to snap the Soonersi 40-game winning streak. _

homa, Miami (Fla.), and Notre
Dame? It looks impossible un-
less more material is brought in
to give the Jungle Cats the nec-
essary depth to compete with his
football giants.

Oklahoma reportedly is-
sues 80 freshmen football
scholarships, Miami (Fla.) 55,1
Notre Dame 35, and numer-' ’
ous other schools in the neigh-
borhood ol’ 30 to 35. All of
these schools play strong
schedules, but it is doubtful
that any have played as mur-,
derous a schedule as the Blue
and Gold over the past, few

. seasons.

While playing this schedule,
the locals supposedly have given
18 full-time scholarships in 1954,
19 in 1955,, and 17- in 1-956. They
possibly could have given more
aid, but they apparently could not
ﬁnd enough outstanding boy.s on
whom they could afford risking
a four-year-scholarship. ~

Their strength held up during
this span only because of the
great freshman teams of 1952
and 1953. The boys who played
on these teams will be graduated

/

   

    

this year with the replacements from the frosh
team being good quality-wise and shal1ow'quanti-

T ty-wise. In order to compete in big-time football a

team ,must be rich in quality as well as quantity.
The ideal number of football scholarships
is between 30 and 35. This may sound like an
extremely large number of grants-in-aid, but I
one must take intoconsideration the fact that
many of these boys will not last through their
senior year. You are fortunate to have 25 play
ball in their sophomore year, 20 in their junior
campaign, and 15 in their senior year.

What, then,1is the chance of Pitt competing
with schools that have 35, football players on
scholarships? A good example of what laxity in
big-time football policy can do is.plainly illustrated
at Notre Dame. Look what happened last year
when the Fighting Irish suffered their worst season
in history by compiling a 2-8 chart.

The athletic brass at South Bend admitted that
Notre Dame was not de-emphasizing football. They

, also admitted that they would have to start bring-

ing in approximately 35 boys each year if they were
going to play a big-time schedule such as they did
in the past. This poor record was not due to the
inability of the coaching staff. It was in all prob-

)ability due to the shortage of manpower caused

by a slight cutback in aid after Terry Brennan suc-
ceeded Frank Leahy as head man.

The problem here in the future will un-
doubtedly be whether or not Pitt can secure
enough boys to represent them on the same
plane athletically and scholastically. \
Finding qualiﬁed players seems to be the major

obstacle that will confront Athletic Director Hamil-
ton in his future efforts to keep Pitt in big-time
football. S .

Even if the number of athletic scholarships re-
main at a set number, suppose 17, it will be diﬁ’i-
cult to bring in even that many high school stars
if the entrance requirements are upped. If we could
ﬁnd an average of only 18 to 20 players in the past

thought facing those two,” he
says. “We are in a good position
to upset them, though, because
they may be overconﬁdent. '

“We have been getting both
good hitting and pitching lately,"
Lewis’ adds.

Lindstrom‘ Unbeaten

Lewis will send Ronnie Moog,
who was voted the most valuable
player by his teammates last
week, and Carl Lindstrom against
the unbeaten Lions. Moog has lost
two straight games after winning
his ﬁrst, four, and Lindstrom has
yet to lose in three tussles.

Last.year Lindstrom lost to

the Lions, 4-2, but Bill Gilmore
defeated them, 3-2.

The Panthers dropped their
eighth game of the year last Sat-
urday to Navy, 7-5, in a contest
that Lewis termed “one of the
most disappointing losses of th
season.”

\ ,

Moog Shelled
Going into the bottom of the
eighth inning, the locals were
ahead, 5-2, mainly on Joe Wal-
ton’s‘ three-runihome run‘ in the

Barnwell Shines
In Close“ Setback

Lions
By» GEORGE BULRBAUGH
The Penn State freshman

track team bested the Pan-

ther frosh at the Stadium Sat-

urday‘ afternoon, 76-55.
Flashy Mel Barnwell was

outstanding in a losing cause
for the Panther thinclads as he
posted a ﬁrst in the 100-yard dash,
the 220—yard dash, and anchored
the mile relay team as they swept
to a 30-yard victory.

Barnwell’s time in the hundred
was 9.9 seconds, and his winning
time in the ‘220’ was 21.5 seconds,
bettering the varsity time by
three-tenths of a second.

Walters Nipped

In the opening track event of
the dull, rainy afternoon, Dick
Englebrick of Penn State nipped

 the Panthers’ George Walters in

the mile with a’ time of 4:175.
.. The Staters continued their
mastery in the 440-yard dash as
Dick Hambright fought off the
challenge of Dave Kelly and
Ron Goldstein to win with a
time of 49.7 seconds. '
Pete Kopsack of Penn - State
won the 120-yard high hurdles in

- 15.7 seconds with Panther ‘Joe

Pelovich second.
Rush Wins Two-Mile Run

The 880-yard run was ‘won by
George Jones of Penn State with
Walters second and Ron Goldstein
third. The Panthers’ Roy Moffitt
led‘ all the way to win the 220-
yard low hurdles over Kopsack
and Sharpe of Penn State. His
winning time was 26.2 seconds.

In the two-mile run, the
Panthers showed well as Ron
Bush, with a great stretch kick,
won over Jack White of Penn
State. Rush’s time for the two-
mile distance was 10 minutes
and 3 seconds.

The Penn State frosh had things
all their own way in the high
jump as Dick Campbell, J ohne Ur-
ban, and Melvin Ramsey ﬁnished
one, two, three in this event.
Campbell cleared the bar at 5 feet,
10 inches for his winning jump.

“Until I joined General Electric’s Research Labora-
tory in 1951, I never realized science could be such
a challenge — or. so much fun. My job involves re-
search in physical chemistry —— the investigation of
new ideas which can lead to new and better products
people can use. In a company of this size, I have the
unique advantage of having the tools and facilities I
need and the experience of others close at hand. And
in return, of course, I’m expected to apply myself to
the best of my ability in each new job. As I see it,
if..a big company like General Electric-invests time,
money and faith in my creative ability, and if I re-
spond by creating, then we both beneﬁt. To me, at
General Electric business and pleasure do mix.”
