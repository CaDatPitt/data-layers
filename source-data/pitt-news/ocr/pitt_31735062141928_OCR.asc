business, and his opinion as to the
opportunity for the young man in the
stock and bond brokerage business.
In connection with the young man’s
opportunity, Mr. Askin advised an as-
sociation with a large house rather

greater facilities which are available,

tom or as a bond salesman.

tory of the New York Stock .Ex-
change, the stringent laws which ap-
ply to stock exchanges, the matter of
government of. the stock exchanges,

take after a trade has been reported

ployed in ﬁlling orders at a price

lectual life is in danger. It would be
a mere excuse indialectics to engage

in more or less abstract discussions.

on inter-university relations when an-
cient and famous universities are on
the point of closing their doors, and
on the exchange of scientiﬁc informa-
tion, when academies and laboratories.
of the first rank will soon be obliged
to discontinue their work. For this
reason, the committee considers that
its ﬁrst duty is to draw attention of
the League of Nations as a whole to
the conditions which govern intellec-
tual‘ life throughout a large‘ part of
Europe.” _ _ ’'

First of all, there is Russia, where
theseconditions would appear to be
almost desperate. Organizations al-
ready exist, ‘however, for the relief
of Russian /intelligentsia, and the
committee has noted, their efforts
with keen interest. Accordingly, the
committee gave their‘ special attention
to those nations which extend from
the Baltic. to the Black Sea and the
Aegean Sea. In all these nations the
organs of intellectual life have suf-
fered injury in varying degree. Some
of them have been aﬁected only
slightly and require little more than
facilities for obtaining books but also
instruments for their clinics anditheir
laboratories. Finally, there is a third
category of nations of such acute eco-
nomic distress that there is a risk
of all intellectual life rapidly becom-
ing impossible.” .

tion of the debts owing us would cost
us far more than they are worth. The
third speaker for Pitt was George W.
Davis, who maintained that it is the
moral duty of the United States to
cancel the war debts owing her. .

At the close of the "debate Chancel-
lor J. G. Bowman who presided asked
the judges to come to the platform.
Judge Thompson announced the un-
animous decision in favor of the af-
ﬁrmative and congratulated the teams
upon their excellent work, saying that
a I judge is seldom given the oppor-
tunity of expressing his sincere opin-
ion, but that he intended to do so as
“it will do a lot of good and I don’t
think it will do anyone any harm.”
Judge Thompson said that he believed
that the United States had made‘ a,

grave and irrevocable mistake in fail- t

ing to become a member of the League
of Nations and in failing to show our
support to the establishment of a
world court of ‘justice. '
After the debate the Harvard men

ELNALS DELAY 

  

  lsggipli GAM

The inevitable ﬁnals are fast ap-
proaching, and slowly as the disas-
trous rumblings of a threatening vol-
cano they will crash before the vic-
tims, dazed. in a bewildering sea of
dizziness. It ‘is at this time that
crushes, thrills, Valentino’s subside
for thetime being. All the fluff and
froth of the new co.-ed with the neat
curl ‘in the middle of her forehead
is sadly banished. Tea dansants and
bridge, signiﬁcant dates and incon-
spicuous movies are deftly thrust
aside. Hark ye, ’tis the ignoble, in-
domitable FINALS that holds the
center of the stage. Quite like the
famous Oberammergau, this unique
production covers a period of a full
week in order: to give each member
in the supporting cast full justice to
her role. First Dame History ﬂaunts
her dates and smirks with satisfac-
tion in the hand that destiny plays-.
Sir Statistics struts out medians and
means and juggles them with delight.
The Economic vamp jazzes out her
profound theories. ‘ .

And so we, the students, the bound
audience must submit to the melodra-
matic tragedy entitled, “Why I Busted
Pitt.” Trot out the conventional mid-
night oil, gather in a few Camels
or Pa11—Malls, and last but not least,
the necessary stimulant, (try and get
it) to carry you through Exam Week.
May the best man survive.

The results‘ offthe_.‘contest showing
the percentage of attendance of the
various classes, departments and fra-
ternities. at the Football Banquet held
in Syria Mosque last Wednesday
evening cannot be published, accord-
ing to an announcement issued by the
Committee-in-charge_ of -the function.
The inability to‘ announce’ results is
due to thefailure to secure “sulficient
information from students attending
the Banquet. i . v ‘ ' .

“Unfortunately, due to ‘the confu-
.sion -caused‘ by a last-minute rush
upon the part of alumni and students
to buy tickets, it will be ‘impossible
to publish accurate results of the at-
tendance. contest,’A’I Mr. MacLeod, a
member of the Banquet Commtitee,
stated. . “The event was the largest
ever ‘held in the history of the Uni-
versity, more than a thousand stu-
dents, alumni‘ and faculty -members
being present. Two days before the
banquet it appeared as if but -ﬁve
hundred persons would ‘attend and,
consequently, ‘but six hundred Icon-
testA information blanks were printed.
This supply seemed to be adequate to
meet the ‘demand "and it was the in-_
tention of the Banquet Committee to
distribute contest blanks along with
programs "and song. sheets‘ so that a

, card could be collected from each per-
’ ‘son attending the Banquet‘ at the

a result, there was a shortage of,fco1_I-
test blanks as well as of. programs
The unanticipated rush
at the last minute made it necessary
to distribute contest blanks during
the course of the dinner rather than
before, as had been planned. Since no
reservations were made and it was
impossible, therefore, to know what
seats, would‘ be occupied by alumni
and‘ what by students, it was decided
toIhave ‘members of the Student Sen-
ate distribute contest blanks to stu-
dents alone and to collect ‘them after

II , they had been properly ﬁlled oIut.’The

system did not work, less than ﬁve

-‘hundred blanks being collected al-

though, more than seven hundred stu-
dents were present. To prepare charts
based upon the meagre, information
secured would be exceedingly unjust
since those "charts would not repre-
sent true conditions. For example,‘
of onefraternity pwhich attended the
Banquet almost one "hundred per cent
strong, but three men appearently
signed cards and to publish a chart
showing that but three members. of
this group were present would work
an injustice’ upon the, organization.
One of the departments of the ‘Uni-
versity. had a large representation
present_but, the cards collected_ indi-
cated that but ‘few attended. I To
place this department at the bottom
of" the chart. would no doubt result
in a storm of protest from the stu-
dents A enrolled thereinﬁ’

Chairman Bert Gaw and other
members of the Banquet Committee
expressed great satisfaction over the
splendid turnout and complimented"
students and alumni upon the excel-
lent spirit displayed. Chairman Gaw
also expressed regret that due to the.
unforeseen rush at the last minute, it

was impossible to secureaccurate in- .
— formation so. that charts showing
various .

what _percentage of v the
groups were in attendance could be
prepared.» He-stated that if‘ a similar
contest is held next year, the supply

of blanks will be large enough to take ,

care of any possible" development.
An expression of gratitude to those

I I ~ A From the Yale News I

THE NINETY-FOUR

Someone, probably an _insurancc
— , agent, was quoted recently as saying
that from the. mass of one hundred
college graduates one individual only
rose to the Polo and butler class, peril-
ously ncar the top of the ﬁnancial lad-
der. Five others became comfortably
"off and found themselves after twenty
years‘xat the" smell yacht and chauffeur
stage. ’The other ninety-four presum-
ably congregate in the great section of .
the American people who drive their
own Buicks to the golf club. In other
words, dreaming about being a-rich
mat!) is one thing, and making the grade
is something else agairI.”I _

IYet the ninety—four presumablywork,
just as’ hard as the sumptuous six. Their.
business is the axis on which a small
and uninteresting world revolves. They

— have become devotees of the dollar
and when that ﬁckle deity deserts, have
nowhere else to turn. A Jammed in a
dull, straight rut of business they can
never leave the road and jump the fence,
intoﬁner fields’ of life. This, then, is
the portionof ninety-four men out of,

every hundred now onihe campus.
‘ ,Thc*answer .to the problem lies in
' the proper choice of a career. “

Between now and Cominencement
we "shall have something to. offer on
the subjeét of “CareeArs.”' Watch for
