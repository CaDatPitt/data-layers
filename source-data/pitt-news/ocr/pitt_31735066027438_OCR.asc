CGS degrees cut

Students in all but nine general studies
majors must move to other Pitt schools

 

Majors offered by both the
College of General Studies and the
College of Arts and Sciences will fall
solely under CAS beginning fall
semester.

This change has come in response
to administrators’ goal to have one
Pitt degree for undergraduate students
on campus.

Students who are currently
enrolled in CGS will not be affected
by this change. However, new stu-
dents entering Pitt in the fall semester
will only be allowed to enroll in CGS
f their major is one of the nine desig-

tcd as distinctive to CGS.

The majors to be kept are admin-
itstration ofjustice, legal studies, pub-

lic administration, humanities, social

sciences, natural sciences, media
communication, health services, and

dental hygiene.

Currently several majors within
CGS are duplicated in CAS and other
colleges on campus. Pitt students who
major in English literature, for exam-
ple, can currently pursue this major in
either CGS or CAS.

Three years ago, a special com-
mittee of deans was appointed to
review CGS and look for ways to
eliminate the overlaps.

According to CGS Associate
Dean Robert Comfort, interim dean of
CGS during the evaluation period, the
committee looked at which majors
were duplicated and ultimately decid-
ed the majors should only be offered
by the college in which the depart-
ment resides.

Comfort voiced his opposition to
the decision by submitting a minority
report to the provost, but was turned
down.

Dean expects delayed FAS
plan to be done Monday

 

 

The Faculty of Arts and
Sciences, now three weeks behind
schedule, will submit its budget draft
to the provost on Monday, according
to the dean.

FAS Dean Peter Koehler
declined comment on possible cuts to
graduate departments included in
that draft.

That plan was originally due by
March 1, along with those from other
schools and regional campuses.
According to Koehler, the delay was
required to spend more time on creat-
ing a better plan.

The FAS Planning and Budget
Committee will meet with Koehler
and his advisory committee on
Friday to finalize the plan. In a memo

 

Tomorrow: Partly sunny. High near 60.

WE Tonight: Cloudy. Low in the mid-30s.

to PBC members, Koehler said that
“the provost needs to have the final
version of the FAS phase [II] plan by
Monday, March 24.”

Provost James Maher said yester-
day that he made no such ultimatum.

“I don’t know anything about
that,” he said. “The deadline was
March 1, and [the plan] isn’t here
yet. I certainly want it  I understand

that with 30 departments, FAS is

such a large unit that it is harder for
them to respond to a March 1 dead-
line. [But] the fiscal year will begin
on the same day for FAS as it is for
everyone else.”

Koehler would not say if Maher
had told him to hurry but did say,
“This is a deadline that we should
meet.  They need to review it when
they review the other schools’

landlords, students: Start early for better picks

Rebecca N. Jones

You’ve decided you don’t want to
spend another year living in the dorms.
Maybe it was too noisy. Maybe it was
being 12 feet from your roommate at all
times. Maybe it was the elevators.

But what it all boils down to is that
you need to get out there and ﬁnd some-
where to live. This means you have a lot
to think about.

location and roommates

Students say that one simple way to
start your search is to ask friends who live
off-campus where they live and if they
like the neighborhood.

Ken O’Shaughnessy, director of the
Office of Property Management, advises
students that no matter what they are told
about an area, to always take a look for
themselves. He says the first step in mov-
ing off-campus is to establish which area
to live in. A "

Most people choose to stay as close
to campus as possible so that they can
walk to their classes each day, he says.
However, there are those students who

would rather live in Shadyside, Squirrel
Hill, and Bloomﬁeld.
These students commute to campus

each day on either Pitt’s shuttle system or

the PAT buses. For this reason, the U-
Zone, in which allows students to ride to
various locations for free with their Pitt
I.D., has been established.

Once students establish the area they
wish to live in, they should take a minute
to ponder who it is they want to live with.
Some students say that just because
you’re great friends with the person down
the hall, doesn’t mean you’ll be great
roommates. j

Renee, a South Oakland resident,
was friends with a another girl from her
ﬂoor in the dorms. They moved in togeth-
er, and now Renee can’t stand her but
doesn’t want to tell her.

“I am trying to be civil towards my
roommate. We only have one month left
on our lease, and I don’t want to start any
unnecessary wars,” said Renee.

She said one way of avoiding the “I-
hate-my-roommate” scenario is to make
sure to ﬁnd a place with "separate bed-
rooms. According to Renee, spending

Around the World

BANGKOK —— Police are looking for a
woman who cut off her husband’s penis and
allegedly attached it to balloons, setting it free
into the Thai skies.

The husband said his wife tricked him

—-into taking two sleeping pills. He awoke a

short time later in intense pain. He said he
saw his wifecarryingaknifeinonehandand
his penis in the other.

Police will not conﬁrm that the wife
attached his penis to balloons. VV1ves chop-
ping oﬂ’ their adulterous husbands’ sexual
organs has been a long-standing tradition in
Thailand. The positive outcome of this phe-
nomenon is that Thai doctors have pioneered
reattachment techniques.

 ‘WE *'

Maniott’s food service contract expires
this summer, and a recent stuvey of Pitt stu-
dents indicated their passing wouldn’t be
mourned.

One hundred sixty—ﬁve food surveys
distributed to students who use food services
show that students rate the overall quality of
food on campus as a 3.4 on a one-to-ﬁve
scale —— one being the best. Using the same
scale, students rated the quality of service as
a 3.7.

Students rating Schenley Cafe gave the
quality of food a score of 3.1 and the service
a 3.8. Several wrote that the employees at
times are rude or mean. In fact, eight stu-
dents used the phrase “attitude adjustment,”
or a variation thereof, as a change they see as
necessary.

Freshman Dave  wrote that he felt
“the employees are sometimes rude and
uncooperative.”

Although most comments were about
the service at the Schenley Cafe, another
majority were in reference to the variety of
food Schenley offers. Several students wrote

' that the variety was adequate.

William Renk, a senior, wrote that vari-
ety was “good” but also noted that “quality
is ba  '

Other students were more specific
about the dining options they are given.
Three Schenley Cafe surveys yielded a

request for more vegetarian options.

Survey documents dissatisfaction with Marriott

Ken Kleckner, another senior, recom-
mended that milk and juice in half-gallon
sizes, microwave dimers, and other “re ar
foods” be provided for students to take
home. a

Across Schenley Quad, responses to the
Marriott survey revealed a similar reaction.

Surveys completed at Eddie’s gave
average scores of 3.3 for quality of food and
3.9 for quality of service. '

Over half of the comments made at the '
food court beneath Towers were pertaining
either to the lack of available food variety or
lack of employees. Many criticized Eddie’s,
saying it should serve less greasy and
unhealthy foods.

Sophomore Nikki Fleming wrote,
“Eddie’s should serve more home—cooked »
meals instead of fast food.”

Another aspect of written criticism was
the need for Eddie’s to staff -the complex
with more workers to relieve the often long
mealtime rush lines.

Sophomore Allison '4 Bryan noted that
more servers should be available, speciﬁcal-
1y during the lunch and dinner rushes.

Junior Dawn Witherspoon suggested
having “one person each for Dunkin’ Donuts
and the ice cream [Baskin-Robbins].”

Next door in the C—Side Cafeteria, the
results remained in the high three-point area,
resulting in a 3.8 for its food quality and a 3.4
for service quality.

time together is one thing — spending
every night together is another.

Sample pnoe ranges

Once a student has decided who he
wants to live with, he should decide on the
price range. Eight hundred dollars for a
two—bedroom in usually considered expen-
srve.

By looking through classiﬁed ads
located in various Oakland and Pittsburgh
newspapers, a student will be able to estab-
lish which area is within his price range.

According to Lisa Simeone of John
C.R. Kelly Realty, their most expensive
unit is located in South Oakland and costs
$950 per month plus gas and electric. The
unit, a four-bedroom, two-bathroom apart-
ment located on Meyran Avenue, includes
full furnishings, air conditioning, and a
dishwasher.

Kelly Realty’s cheapest unit, also fur-
nished, is a studio located on the Boulevard
of the Allies and costs _$350 a month plus-
gas and electric.

Simeone said that the average cost for
an apartment through Kelly is anywhere
from $400 to $500 plus gas and electric.
These units are usually one-bedrooms
which include heat, have air conditioning,
and are fully furnished. Simeone also said
that two bedrooms usually start at $635
plus gas and electric.

Melwood Centre Complex in North
Oakland has units ranging from studios to
four bedrooms. According to Rose Yost, an
agent for Melwood Centre Complex, stu-
dios start as low as $299 including utilities.
As units get larger, prices go up.

One-bedroom apartments start from
$399 plus electric to $550 including utili-
ties. Yost said that Melwood Centre also
has one-bedroom apartments for $435 plus
gas and electric. These units come
equipped with central air conditioning.
T\avo-bedrooms start at $650 and go up to
$699. Three—and four-bedrooms through
Melwood Centre start at $799 plus electric
and go to $800 plus electric.

A representative from “K” Rentals
refused to comment on their prices or loca-
tion.

What to look for

Both students and landlords say it is
best for students to start looking for places
as soon as they can. With the demand for
off-campus housing so high, many apart-
ments will go quickly.

O’Shaughnessy says that as the search
begins, there are many important things to
keep in mind when looking at apartments.
Don’t just walk in to an apartment and
decide you want the place.

Property management issues a renters’
checklist for visits to apartments. The fol-
lowing suggestions expand on this check-
list.

0 Is the building clean and well main-
tained on both the interior and exterior? If
not, ask the landlord if he plans on cleaning
or painting before the next tenants move in.

Thursday, March 20, ‘I997

 

- Find out if the building has a security
system. Look for adequate locks on both
doors and windows. If there aren’t any, ask
if they can be installed. Don’t jeopardize
your safety to save a few bucks.

0 Check for ﬁre exits and smoke detec-
tors. Make sure to ask if the smoke detec-
tors work. If they don’t work, what is the
use of having them? Make sure to get them
replaced as soon as you move in.

- Ask the landlord if there are laundry
facilities in the building. If not, ask where
the nearest laundromat is. Consider the
walk to the laundromat when making your
decision. Also, if laundry is in the building,
ask whether it is coin—operated or not. If
not, chances are, you are going to have to
pay for it in paying your utilities.

0 Ask if utilities are included in rent.
Utilities can include gas, electric, water,
and sewage bills. Ask current tenants what
they usually pay per month for each bill.
Don’t forget to include cable and telephone
bills when ﬁguring out utilities.

0 If you have a car, or plan on owning
a vehicle, ask the landlord about parking
allotments. Is parking designated by per-
mit, or will you already have a space set
aside for you? If parking is by permit,
remember there is only so much room on
the street and parking is on a first-come-
ﬁrst-served basis.

0 You will want to know how far the
apartment is from convenience or grocery
stores. If you don’t have a car, ﬁgure how
long it will take to walk home from Giant
Eagle carrying full grocery bags.

- When looking at apartments, always
remember to check closet space. Are there
enough closets for everyone who plans on
living in the apartment? Will people have to
share closets, and are they okay with this?
If there are enough closets for everyone, are
they big enough to hold all of your clothes?

If not, you will need a large enough
dresser to accommodate your needs. Check
to see if you have enough room in the apart-
ment for what furniture you have and what
furniture you will need to get.

0 Many apartments come furnished
already. If the place you are looking at is
considered funrished, find out what items
belong to the landlord and their condition.
You may not want the apartment to be fur-
nished if these items are falling apart.

- Check to make sure all electrical out-
lets are securely ﬁtted to the walls. If they
are not, check to see if they are just missing
screws of if they are broken. Broken outlets
are a safety hazard which can result in a
fire.

° Check the faucets to see whether or
not there is adequate water pressure. Check
to see how fast it takes for the water to get
hot. Ask the landlord how big the water
tank is. Ifcurrent tenants are in the building,
ask them about hot water usage. Find out

how long it takes before the water goes cold '

in the shower.

Keep this in mind when choosing a
place. If there are three of you, you proba-

Maher said that he has already
begun reviewing the drafts from other
schools.

“I don’t expect to respond to any
of the plans until we’ve done a full
review of the plans, and I think that
that response is likely to go to the
deans by the middle of May,” Maher
said.

Earlier this month, Vice Provost
Robert Pack said he expected the
deans to hearback by April 15.

The PBC meeting on Friday is
scheduled to last foi just two hours.
With the intention of handing off on

were again concerned with health food
choices, as well as the cafeten'a’s closing
time.

“Nutritious choices are available, like
the vegetarian line, but there’s not much
variety among them,” wrote freshman
Newell Embley.

Freshman Nicole Orlando also stated
the cafeteria should have longer hours.

Currently, the C-Side facility closes at 7
p.m., which is the earliest closing time of

any on—campus establishment.

Student Government Board recently
stepped in to curb the dissatisfaction with the
on—campus food service.

SGB presented a 38—page proposal of
changes to Food Services just before spring
break, with sections that focused on each of
the campus eating areas.

’ For Schenley Cafe, SGB recommend-
ed the insertion of a Chick-Fil-A, Panda

:Express, and Subway. They would like

i these vendors to replace Pizza Hut, Manchu
Wok, and Hometown Hero.

An individual student survey also
‘showed many students would like a Taco
Bell.

V SGB’s proposal to Food Services sug-
gested that Eddie’s provide more food in a
block special, bring in new vendors (such as
Wendy’s and Papa John’s), extend its hours
of operation, and expand the sales area to
improve the ﬂow of student traﬂic.

The SGB proposed that the C-Side
Cafeteria provide more premium meals
which include “all of the luxuries of a home-

~'cooked meal,” incorporate healthy choices
like potato and pasta bars, and extend their
hours of operation.

Director of Food Services Betsy
Sallade-Farina said Pitt is letting SGB’s sug-
gestions be known to food services contend-
ing for the next on-campus contract this
summer.

“We’re encouraging brand new con-

; cepts,” she said.

“It’s going to improve what we do
for them,” Koehler said. “We are try-
ing to change [faculty members’] atti-
tudes so that more attention is paid to
the undergraduate education. It’s not a
‘we will stop graduate education and
shift all attention to undergraduate,’
but we have to do better with the
undergraduates. And in some places
we may have to reduce what we do for
the graduates.

“A lot of the grief I’m getting to is
to be able to help [undergraduates]
better.”

“I can understand where the
provost is_ coming from and what he
wants to accomplish,” said Comfort.
“But I think CGS can do a better job
than CAS in providing the services that
meet the needs of those students who
have familial and work responsibilities
as well as school.”

While Comfort is opposed to the
change, current CGS Dean Robert
Carter and CAS Associate Dean David
Brumble both support the plan.

.Carter said he believes that by ini-
tiating this transition, the undergradu-
ate degree offered to Pitt students will
be strengthened.

_ “The motivation is that if you get a
degree, it should be a degree from the
University of Pittsburgh, not a degree
from the CGS or CAS program of the
University,” Carter said.

Students who choose not to enter
into one of the nine speciﬁed majors
will have to enroll in CAS or one of the
other colleges which offer their majors.

“We are going to begin to imple-
ment the new changes as soon as possi-
ble,” Carter said. “Beginning next year,
only adult, non—traditional students and
full—time students who are interested in
one of the degrees only CGS will pro-
vide will be admitted into the CGS pro-

gram. Students coming from high

school who are pursuing a major which
CAS has will have to go to CAS, not‘
CGS.”

Those students deciding to transfer
into CAS must have a minimum of 24
credits obtained in CGS and a QPA of
2.0 or better. These requirements mir-
ror those needed by Pitt branch campus
students transferring to the Oakland
campus.

, Brumble said it will be important
to make the transition as smooth as
possible for all CGS students entering

, CAS.

  Vii. .. FROM PAGE I 

One way CAS hopes to ease ‘the
transition is by providing night courses
in 13 popular majors to allow adult and
non—traditional students a way to grad-
uate in a timely manner. These majors
include chemistry, communications,
computer science, history of art and
architecture, history, economics, math-
ematics, philosophy, political science,

I sociology, English literature, English

writing, and psychology.

“The University recognizes and
will continue to- recognize that many
students who are non—traditional stu-
dents need night classes to fit into their
busy schedules outside of the
University,” said Carter. “We will con-
tinue to do our best to accommodate
them.”

Brumble also stressed the need for
night course offerings and stated they
would remain one of Pitt’s top priori-
ties.

“We realize that these students
need night courses and alternative
scheduling of classes,” said Brumble.
“That is why they went to CGS in the
first place. No one is considering cut-
ting back on ‘night course offerings.”

While only nine majors will be
authorized as CGS majors, Comfort
hastened to add that the possibility for
new majors and degree programs with-
in CGS exists. l

“CGS has traditionally been
looked to as being the experimental
testing grounds for new programs at
the University,” said Comfort. “Part of
our mission as stated during the com-
mittee meetings is that CGS will con-
tinue to serve as a place where new
programs and services will be devel-
oped. While no plans are currently on
the table for the creation of a new
major, the possibility exists.”

Apartments A

bly won’t be able to take a shower one after
another like in the dorms.

0 Also, look for water damage in the
bathroom and kitchen. If you see water
damage, chances are, there is something
wrong with the pipes and plumbing. You
should avoid living in a place where water
damage is clearly visible.

0 Look for adequate cabinet space in
kitchens. Also, is there enough room for a
table and chairs in the kitchen if you don’t
have a separate dining area? Are appliances
such as the stove and refrigerator in work-
ing order? Is there enough room in the
refrigerator for everyone’s food and drinks?

- If you plan on having parties, ﬁnd out i

who your neighbors are. Chances are, if
you are living near older people, they will
not want you to have loud parties at night
and may call the police if they hear one. If
you don’t anticipate this to be a problem,
these people are good to have as neighbors

because they generally won’t bother you.
0 Find out what the pet policy is. Many
places do not allow pets. Some will allow a

cat or small dog with an additional security i’
deposit. Landlords usually don’t require a_

security deposit for ﬁsh.

- Ask what the security deposit policy
is. By law, landlords are required to give
renters a refund of their security deposit or
a reconciliation of why they are not getting
their deposit back within 30 days. Also, on
the same note, tenants are required to leave
a forwarding address to the landlord in
order to receive their security deposit or
reconciliation notice. '

- Also, be advised that while many
landlords will sign a lease with four people,
it is against housing codes to be on a lease
with more than three unrelated people. So,
if you plan on living in an apartment with
four people, technically your lease is
unlawful.

  restructurin will u
costs and ease confusion

Majors which are offered in both the College of
General Studies and the College of Arts and Sciences
will fall under CAS starting next fall.

Due to the fact that most students who opt to go to
CGS do so because of the night classes which allow
them to hold full-time jobs while attending college,
CAS will continue to offer night classes in the majors
that are most popular with CGS students.

As long as those night classes will continue to be
offered, the decision to have all students in those
majors enroll in CAS is one which will save money
and offer more convenience to students.

This will save on administrative costs, because
there will not have to be separate CGS and CAS advi-
sors as well as separate faculty in the different col-
leges. .
By having a single University of Pittsburgh
degree, there will be less confusion over which school
at Pitt grants students degrees. This change will also
ensure more continuity in what requirements each stu-
dent will have to fulfill.

CGS will continue to offer those majors which are
not offered by CAS, giving students a wider variety of
options.

The move to rid Pitt of duplicate majors in sepa-
rate schools will make the University into a more uni-
fied and efficient institution. Having all students go
through the same procedures eliminates the added
time and energy of duplicate services offered by sepa-
rate schools. -

Now, students can be proud to have a University
of Pittsburgh degree without the unjust stigma of hav-
ing graduated from “night school.” As long as CAS
continues to offer night classes to accommodate non-
traditional students, everyone will benefit from this
decision.

 

THE PITT NES

Don't give up because politics won out

 

Well, by now you are proba-

bly tired of reading articles about
Bigelow Boulevard. Over the
past year, there have been out-
cries from students, community
groups, businesses, city council

members, and the University-

There have been countless meet-
ings, back—room deals, public
hearings, surveys, and other stu-
dent initiatives. As a student who
has been involved with this issue
from the begimiing of this ordeal,
I have to admit that I am a little
bit biased, and (with good rea-
son) more than a little frustrated.

So why am I writing this?
Mainly to give you a little insight
into some of the things that went
on, and instead of bitching about
the outcome, to tell you what still
should be done. I do not think
that all we can do as students now
is complain. What we can do is
show those people who did not
support our interests that they
cannot use us at their discretion.

First, I would like to com-
mend those individuals and
groups who tried and failed to
achieve what is most beneficial
to us. Those individuals and
groups include Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg, the Governmental
Relations Office, the Office of
Parking and Transportation, the
SGB, the Bigelow Boulevard
Task Force, SEAC, Mayor
Murphy, city planning officials,
myself, and several others who I
am sure I overlooked.

Now, the important question
is, who did not support our inter-
ests? Those are the people who
should not be forgotten. It is these

people, whom we often have sup-
ported, who should in no way
ever again receive any of our
time, money, votes, or support.
These people are City
Councilman Jim Ferlo, who has
repeatedly insulted intelligence
of our student body, and City
Councilman Bob O’Connor, who
has currently undertaken his
mayoral campaign and who has
enjoyed publicity photos and
appearances with our student
leaders and student groups while
assuring us that he is going to do
great things for us and Oakland.

Well, we now know that
when his decision counted, he
stabbed us in the back. He did not
support our interests, yet he
expects our votes when he runs
for mayor. I don’t think so.

How about Sid Simon and
his family, who own and run the
Original Hot Dog Shop? Yes, the
very business that is supported
primarily by your money.
Initially, their main complaint
was that they did not have Choice
Dollars; we gave them that. Then
they wanted parking; the
University put in a parking lot at
the comer instead of a park. They
also wanted a loading zone; they
got that. . D

Despite this, the 0 still did
not support your interest. They
claimed that it would hurt their
business because, God knows,
people drive in from far and wide
for their greasy pizza and fries.
The businesses that did not sup-
port us have to realize that it is
we who primarily make up their
business. Other businesses that
opposed us besides those listed in
the newspapers are known
through a‘ survey done by SGB.

This survey should now be print-
ed to show that we do mean busi-
ness. Since they did not support
your interests, are you going to
support theirs financially by
patronizing their restaurant? I’m
not.

The arguments of those who
opposed A closing Bigelow
changed every time one of these
problems was solved. They said
it would eliminate parking. Pitt

solved this problem. Then they ‘

said that it would create a huge
traffic problem. I believe that the
trial closing showed that the traf-
ﬁc problem was not too bad, and
that the compromise itself will
eliminate parking and create the
same trafﬁc problem. They cited
safety reasons as our main con-
cern. When it was a campus, that
was our main concern. They said
it would hurt businesses, while
the business surveys showed that
the majority of the businesses
supported the closing. Even
Chas, the Pitt Shop vendor on the
comer whose business would be
most affected, supported the stu-
dents. Why? Because we support
him.

After all is said and done -
the political motives, personal
biases against the University,
public attacks, etc. — the politi-
cians have won, the University
has gained a little, and it was all
done at the expense of Oakland’s
greatest asset. It is clearly the stu-
dents who have lost, and it is our
responsibility that those who did
not support us should not -receive
our votes, our money, our patron-
age, or our support.

Marc F riedberg knows that if we
band together, we can close that
stinkin ’ street!

SPORTS

 

There is a time
and a place
for everything

 

There have been many “miracles” per-
formed in sports as far back as I can remem-
ber.

The 1980 United States “Do you believe
in miracles?” hockey team comes to many
people’s minds as one of the greatest
moments in sports history, at least to those in
non—communist countries.

Broadway Joe and his meny bunch of
New York Jets in Super Bowl 1]] pulled off
yet another doozy over the Baltimore Colts.
They talked the talk and walked the walk
way back when love was free and smack
was cheaper: good old 1969.

I can’t leave out the sharpshooting
Villanova Wildcats under Rollie Massirnino
in 1985. "Ihe Expansion Crew” made up of
Ed Pinckney, Dwayne McClain, and Gary
McLain led the Cats in their 22-28 shooting
performance en route to their 66-64 upset of
Georgetown.

These miracles have been stored away
in the annals of sports’ greatest moments and
they almost met their newest cohort with the
tale of Derek Anderson.

Derek Anderson is a 6—foot—5 senior

, guard for Kentucky. He was a member of the

VV1ldcats 1996 National Championship team
under Rick Pitino. He was leading the SEC
powerhouse this season with 18.6 points, 4.3
rebounds, 3.7 assists, and 2.] steals per game
before his season, only 18 games long, came
crashing to an end Jan. 18 against Auburn,
when he tore the anterior cruciate ligament in
his right knee.

Two days later, Anderson had recon-
structive surgery on the knee, and had to face
the fact that he was out for the season. A sea-
son in which Kentucky was a major con-
tender to make a return trip to the Final Four
and repeat as NCAA National Champions.

An injury of this magnitude usually
shelves an athlete for six to eight months. On
Tuesday, however, Kentucky team physi-
cians reported that Anderson was physically

on sports around campus and beyond

Mike Hoffman
Senior, Harrisburg, Pa.

The Pitt News: If you could go back
and attend any Pitt athletic event

- . which one would it be?

Mike Hoffman: I really didn’t follow
Pitt sports much before I got here and
since attending Pitt there haven’t been
many to brag about. From a limited
knowledge of Pitt history I would have
to say Tony Dorsett winning the
Heisman trophy.

TPN: If you had to pick one non-con-
ference team for the Pitt football and
basketball teams to play who would it
be?

MH: For the football team it would
have to be one that falls in the broad

range of cupcake but short of power-
house. Army would prove to be a
competitive game that could draw
national airtime and at the same time
not be embarrassing to Pitt. Bring on
anyone for the basketball team.
Vonteego Cummings could d—up any-
one. I would love to see UCLA at the
Fieldhouse.

TPN: If and when the Convocation
Center is built, who do you think the
school should name it after?

MH: The greatest Steel High Roller
and third all-time Pitt 3-point shooter
-— Rodney Brookins. But that proba-
bly wouldn’t draw that much support.

niel Keane
Senior, Willow Grove, Pa.

    

The Pitt News: If you could
go back in time and be a Pitt
sports legend for a day who
would it be and when?

Daniel Keane: I would want
to be Curtis Martin the day he
decided he made the best
decision of his life: to leave
Pitt and then get to the Super
Bowl with the Patriots.

TPN: Where do you think the
best location for the proposed
Convocation center would
be?

DK: I believe it is in the
University’s best interest to

level South Oakland and
build right on top of the rub-
ble. They should be sure to
clear out the entire area in
order to make sure that there
is plenty of parking.

TPN: Are you excited that
Pitt and Penn State are renew-
ing their rivalry on the foot-
ball field next year?

DK: I am not really excited
for the football season, but I
would be excited if we play
them in basketball because
they have one of the best
teams in the country.

Anderson is a senior who hasn’t had

what one would call an injury-free career.
Before he transferred to Kentucky, Anderson
played two seasons at Ohio State (1992-
I994) where he broke his hand and tore the
ACL in his left knee.

Pitino was faced with a tough decision:
allow his star to come back and help the
VVrldcats stave off the rest of the West Region
or risk a bright, lucrative future in the NBA.

After three practices, Pitino weighed his
options and made a decision that may hurt
his team down the line, leaving them with
eight scholarship players and one walk—on,
but may have saved the future for one of his
players. ,

Anderson is better off after this decision.
He will have to prove himself and his knee
April 4 at the NBA Camp in Phoenix, and
another ring isn’t worth what the pro ranks
can bring him.

Maybe Anderson would have come
back, been the ultimate success story, and
deﬁed the medical world, but he could have
just as easily been that poor guy who had
such a bright future but just came back too
soon.

Hats off to Pitino and Anderson for the
decision, and don’t be surprised when Craig
Sager is asking Anderson how grateful he is

Bill Parise, an agent representing Curtis
Anderson, is thoroughly impressed with Cochran.

“I think you have a really special talent [in
Cochran],” Parise said. “You have a guy who’s real-

Parise’s client, senior defensive—back Curtis
Anderson, will also most likely ﬁnd his way onto an
NFL roster on draft day. Anderson produced
impressive results on Pro Day, despite working out
with a calf strain. He ran a 4.4&second 40, a 4.12-
second shuttle, and posted a 36 l/2-inch vertical.

Anderson’s most impressive ability can’t be
found on a statistics sheet. Anderson was switched
to comerback from wide receiver before the Miami
game last season. What’s more amazing is that he
was able to make the transition after only three
practices at the position and did well against one of
the speediest teams in the country.

“[Scouts] are amazed at his turnover from wide
receiver to DB,” Parise said. “Also, the irnprove—

think Curtis’ stock is signiﬁcantly on the rise.”

“I wasn’t invited [to the NFL combine],”
Anderson said. “After my workout with the

The Washington Redskins, New York Giants,
and Indianapolis Colts have shown the most inter-

Some other draft-eligible Pitt notables and their
workout results are: defensive end Jason Chavis
(4.75—second 40/4.76—second shuttle), wide receiver
Mark Butler (4.47-second 40/4.06-second shuttle),
and running back Chris Beasley (5.00-second

Defensive lineman Mike Mohring didn’t partic-

Stellar recruits taking Piﬂ
back to the top and more

   

.ch<.=.r'

 

Pitt’s basketball team ﬁnished with
their ﬁrst winning season since 1993, much
to the credit of the heralded recruiting class
of 1995. '

Head Coach Ralph Willard reeled in six
big-time players his first season as head
coach at Pitt. In that year’s early November
signing .period, Vonteego Cummings and
Isaac Hawkins signed letters of intent. Then,
in the April signing period, Kellii Taylor,
Andre Howard, Michael Gill, and Mark
Blount all opted for Pittsburgh.

Their ﬁrst year together, the 1995-96
season, wasn’t the breakthrough year for
Pitt that a lot of people, including ESPN
announcer Dick Vrtale, predicted. For
starters, Louisiana power forward Isaac
Hawkins spent the year at Hargrave
Military Academy making himself academ-
ically eligible. The 6’8” Hawkins let Willard
know that he was ready physically also, by
scoring 24 points, grabbing 12 rebounds,
and blocking four shots a game at Hargrave.

Thenumberofrecnritsontheroster
dwindled further after only two games.
Three-point wiz Taylor played 14 minutes
inalosstoGeorgia,butscoredninepoints
on 3-for-5 shooting ﬁorn 3-point land,
pulled down three rebounds, and registered
one steal in his only game of the year. But
back problerrrs afflicted Taylor, ending his
season.

Of the remaining four freshman,
Cummings. high—school third-team
“Parade” all-American point guard, made
the biggest name for himself. He started in
Pitt’s ﬁrst game of the season against cross-
town rival Duquesne and led the Panthers
with 18 points. He played in the next six
games before fracturing his hand in practice
on January 2, which, coupled with the ﬂu,
caused Cummings to miss nine straight
games. Upon returning to the line-up,
Cummings played in all 11 remaining
games and ﬁnished the season averaging
6.4 points and 3.4 rebounds a game.

Gill, Washington, D.C. player of the
year; and Philadelphia native Howard
shared time at the forward position, com-
bining for 7.8 points and 5.5 rebounds per
game. Both big men turned in a couple of
double—digit scoring performances in limit-
ed playing time.

Blount, the center hailing ﬁorn New
York as a “Parade” All—American, chal-
lenged junior Gerald Jordan for starting
time late in the season. Blount ﬁnished the
year with a team—leading 27 blocks while
averaging only 14 minutes a game.

In the off-season before this year, Gill
transferred out for personal reasons, Taylor
returned from his back injuries, Hawkins
qualiﬁed, and Blount and Howard bulked
up 10-15 pounds to weather another bang-
and-bruise year in the Big East.

Coming into this season, the original

six recruits were now three sophomores
(Blount, Cummings, Howard), and two
freshmen (Hawkins, redshirted freshman
Taylor) ready to prove they were the next
Fab Five.

Pitt started slowly at 1-5, but all ﬁve
players made immediate impacts. 1

Cummings immediately blossomed as
the ace of the team, averaging 12 points a
game early on. Blount secured the starting
center spot and redirected 24 shots in the
ﬁrst six games. Howard ﬁlled in admirably
for the injured Chad Varga, scoring and
rebounding up front. Taylor emerged as a
scoring threat with the capability to steal the
ball from opponents’ top ball handlers.
Hawkins came olf the bench, shooting the
ball well for a big man while pulling down
rebounds.

As the season went on,. Cummings
dazzled ﬁeld house crowds with his 16.4
points a game, 2.7 steals a game (top 20
nationally), and team—leading 131 assists
going into the NIT. Taylor’s scoring was
enatic but strong enough for a team-third
9.9 points per contest. More importantly,
Taylor’s 3.2 steals a game placed him sec-
ond irr the nation for thievery.

Blount became an inside force to be
reckoned with. His scoring improved
steadily during the year as he ﬁnished the
season with 9.1 points per game, shooting at
49 percent. His defensive presence intirni—
dated Big East opponents on route to 2.7
blocked shots a game, good enough for sec-
ond in the Big East.

Howard’s play on the season was spo-
radic, as he registered 2.7 points and 3.3
rebounds a game. He also blocked 10 shots
and stole the ball 16 times. Hawkins shot the
ball at 43 percent and blocked a team-sec-
ond 21 shots in his ﬁrst season. By far, his
most impressive perfonnance was a,14—
point, nine-rebound contribution olf the
bench against Big East tournament champs
Boston College.

“I just went in and played hard,” said
Hawkins about his monster performance.

So what does the future hold for the
ﬁve recruits of ‘95? Second-team all—Big
East Curnrrrings says he’ll do “whatever it
takes to win” next season. Blount returns as
one of the top three or four centers in the Big
East and will need to step up his game if Pitt
wants to improve signiﬁcantly from this-
year’s 18-15 record. If Taylor regains his 3-
point shot from two years ago, he’ll be one
of the conference’s top guards. Hawkins
and Howard will both need to bang the
boards more aggressively and set examples
for next year’s forward—loaded recruiting
class.

Wﬂlard has conﬁdence that the class of
‘95 will mesh with the incoming freshmen
for another productive season.

“I’m very optimistic about next year,”
he said. “Our young guys are doing well,
and we have a good recruiting class oorning

There can never be enough said about
supporting your local musician. Shale, the
1985, and Jumbo do not beg for your sup-
port, but their music demands it. So, if you
haven’t heard any of them by now, then
you’d better get hip quick. They play often
enough and locally enough so they’re
never too hard to ﬁnd.

Shale
Lie
Peas Kor Records

Shale’s debut LP, Lie, on Peas Kor
Records, contains ﬁve long, sometimes
spooky, songs. The first song, “Rheostat,”
starts things off fast. A few seconds of quiet
guitars had me expecting a long, instru-
mental build—up. But no, the quartet
unleashes a ferocious attack that continues
throughout the entire song. The next track,
“Proud R.J.,” takes a longer building—up
approach, but the music is involved
enough to keep your attention by making
you listen closely to get the riff down in
your head. Then, with little warning, the
song explodes into metal chaos, or chaotic
metal, something that would have scared
even Black Sabbath. In fact, the whole
album seemsto have a spooky sound to it.
 which makes up some of the
slowest segments on the album, contains
some really eerie melodies. I listened alone
in my room, hoping that the song would
reach a crux which would alleviate my
near fear of Shale. But the arrangement
taunted me several times with louder seg-
ments which broke back in to the scary-
stuff again. When the taunting ended, I

found myself even more petriﬁed. The
song changed abruptly from its meander-
ing state to something loud and pounding,
forcing me out of my room to check if the
knocking in my brain wasn’t somebody at
my back door. Good thing I like being
scared. And you will too when listening to
Lie — that is, unless you already are a hor-
ror junkie. Then you will enjoy the
bugged-out feeling you get when you
finally hear it. For this album, I recom-
mend a solitary, basement location for your
first listening.

The 1985’s seven inch record is also
good for those who want want to be scared.

shirts for their performance, only to stain
them with their own insatiable lust for

  

The ‘cream of Piurgh’s

blood. Scary stuff!

These songs cut to your heart of dark-
ness and leave as quickly as they came.
The songs themselves become trances —
ranting, incoherent, but probably disturb-
ing —— blurbs directed at you, especially the
mysteriously untitled, short, and more
puckish “third song” at the end of side one.

Act H, or side two, doesn’t allow any
smiles yet. The names alone, “Blackout”
and “Killing Spree,” make you wonder
about the 1985’s twisted, apparently death-
obsessed minds, or at least their drinking
capacity.

The 1985 released seven inch record at

their March 11 record release show at the

Beehive, and yes, they terrorized every-

one there. But I’m sure they made some
ﬁiends, too; their ﬁve—song release is a
bargain at $3.

The name of this band says it all. Their
sound? Big as hell. “Peppering the
Absurdity” peppers you from the song’s
opening bars until its end. Quirky time
changes maintain their punch due to the
chunky yet intricate riffs. The singing
ﬂows well over the changes, binding the
song’s overall force rather than becoming
merely an obligatory part of the band.

Underground that Jumbo is one of

Citizen Ruth

Directed by Alexander Payne

Starring Laura Dem, Swoozie Kurtz,
and Burt Reynolds

Citizen. Ruth is a hilarious and pro-
foundly disturbing satirical look at
America’s most divisive moral crisis: the
abortion controversy. In his groundbreak-
ing directorial debut, Alexander Payne
deals with abortion in a more straightfor-
ward zmd honest way than any previous
feature film ever has.

Laura Dern stars as Ruth Stoops, a
certified paint huffer and estranged moth-
er of four. Ruth’s life revolves around the
act of sucking down booze and paint
fumes in alleyways, passing out, and, as

 

happens at the beginning of the ﬁlm, get-
ting arrested. Upon this, the latest of many
arrests, she is informed that she is once
again pregnant. The judge decides to nail
her on felony charges for endangering the
life of her unborn child, and Ruth gets put
in the slarnmer.

The judge discreetly informs Ruth,
off the record, that he will consider reduc-
ing her charges if she will see a doctor to
“take care of the problem.” Seeing as she
is in no hurry to have another kid, the
prospect of aborting the fetus seems like a
good one to her. In jail, she hooks up with
a group of kind and freaky pro—life women
who have been arrested for protesting at
the local abortion clinic. She is then bailed

out by the husband-and—wife team who
lead the local chapter of the Baby Savers
group. They want to take care of Ruth
and make sure she has the baby in order
to send a message to the country in what
becomes an extremely high—proﬁle case.

Thus begins the story of Citizen
Ruth, a white trash chick who unwitting-
ly ﬁnds herself at the center of a whirl-
wind of media whores and fanaticism.
She doesn’t give a shit whether abortion
is right or wrong, she just knows that she
wants to have one. She is “rescued” by a
pro—life lesbian who had been operating
undercover as a spy in the Baby Savers
group.

Payne spares no one in his scathing
indictment of the extremists involved on
both sides of the issue. The pro-choice
women who allow Ruth to stay with them
sing to the “moon goddess” at night,
while the pro—lifers are obvious nutballs.
A Vietnam vet named Harlan (played by
M.C. Gainey) who sympathizes with the
pro-choice movement because of his
deep belief in personal freedom provides
security for the abortion clinic. Gainey
has the second—most immediately appeal-
ing role in the ﬁlm. He is a man who
believes in standing behind his beliefs,
and is willing to go to any length to do so,
including countering the Baby Savers’
very public attempt to bribe Ruth into
having her child. ~

The ultimate performance of the ﬁlm
undoubtedly goes to Burt Reynolds in his
role as Blaine Gibbons, the national head

of the Baby Savers. He is the type of
Christian who likes to relax in his oﬁice
while his pubescent young boy assistant
rubs him down with oil. His presence on-
screen is captivating. I actually laughed
out loud.

Citizen Ruth is at once touchingly
realistic and absurdly comic. Set in
Payne’s hometown of Omaha, the perfect
backdrop for a story dealing with extrem-
ists, the movie presents American life as
it truly is. The scenes of Ruth getting high
by herself and partying with the right-
wingers’ teenage daughter did not cop to
the sort of stupid, unrealistic stoner paro-
dy we have come to expect from
Hollywood. She seeks escape, and in
what could be seen as a cheap way out for

Citizen Ruth is a lot of fun, which is
not something you would expect from a
movie about abortion. That’s the beauty
of it. I was really surprised by how much
I liked it. Dem seemed at home playing
the central character, about whom it
would not be inappropriate to say, has

Dem. I’ve just always found her best suit-
ed for these kinds of roles. All of the per-
formances are great, and many of the
actors are not professionals, but folks like
Reynolds and Trppi Hedren still manage
to pop up just in time to amuse the audi-
ence. This ﬁlm is a satire without a polit-
ical agenda, which is the best kind of all.

Chris Whitley
Terra Incognita
Work Records

Listener beware: the ﬁrst
track on this album is not repre-
sentative of the rest of the songs.
“As Flat As the Earth (exp)” is a
clean acoustic cut on which you
can hear the squeak of ﬁngers
moving over the strings and
Chris Whitley’s distinctive voice
coming clearly over the music.
All of Whitley’s talent as a musi-
cian is evident in the crisp guitar
playing, but the next song is a
slide into the electric buzz of his
second album, Din of Ecstasy,
where he moved away from the
acoustic blues of Living With
The Law, his first album.

This third album is a mix of
the acoustic sound of Living
With the Law and the giungier
sound of Din. The mix is done
well, in that there is nothing that
doesn’t seem as though it is hor-
ribly out of place, although the
transitions between the various
songs are sometimes almost jar-
ring. From the airy first cut, to
the Johnny Winter—like
“Gasket,” to the solid “Power
Down,” this album combines
eclectic elements from the ﬁrst
two albums with something

new.

There are two main reasons
to listen to any of Whitley’s
albums. The first is his musi-
cianship. His playing has a very
distinctive style to it. It has been
said that he uses his own tuning,
and if this is so, it may be what
contributes to the fact that he
doesn’t sound like the run-of-
mill pop star, but there is some-
thing more to it than that.

His guitar playing seems to
come out of an eclectic blues tra-
dition that has added what
Whitley sees as the best pieces
of other styles. There is old—fash—
ioned rock and roll, and even
some grunge, but in all of this is
a faith in the possibilities of what
sounds a man can make with a
guitar.

The second reason to listen
is his songwriting. Whitley’s
lyrics are a bit vague at times.

For example, “Cool
Wooden Crosses” opens with:

“From bitter to empty/ Go
the bridges through town/ from
valley to valley/ before she bums
them down”

There’s no explanation to
any of this later in the song.
What this means is not clear,
except for the meaning the lis-
tener attaches to it.

Another example‘ comes
from what is probably the best
track on the album, which is
“Immortal Blues.”

“Well I get so tired from
blissed-out death/ You know with
all that hangs on a single breath/
Now I’m up in the morning she
brings me rest/ from the longings
of a lethal jest”

I’m not one of those guys
who hangs around until the wee
hours of the morning debating
what songs mean. I don’t care.
Unlike some of my friends who
are fans of particular artists, I
don’t care to read all the inter-
views and know the biographies
and psycho—analyses of every
song. In fact, I avoid the inter-
views, websites, and the like.

Just tell me if there is a new‘

Whitley album out and I’m there
the next day to buy it.

The meaning that can be
attached to the music and lyrics
is whatever the listener wants to
attach to them. People enjoy
music because it means some-
thing to them, and Whitley’s
music is ideal for this.

That reason is what keeps
me away from the fan clubs and
websites.

All three of Whitley’s
albums are worth listening to for

these reasons. His first, Living
With The Law has a bluesy
sound. The second album, Din
of Ecstasy, is reminiscent of
Neil Young or grunge without
the angst. Terra Incognita, the
third, is a mixture of these which
seems to work well.

Whitley proves that being
connected with a major label
does not mean you have to play
what the market dictates. He
plays his music, which is ,dis—
tinctive, and is not running

around talking about “sell-outs”
and “indie rock.”

People should grab these
albums and listen to them for the
songs themselves. Once they
hear them and like them, then
they can worry about what he
had in mind. when he wrote
them. Chances are, however,
that those who like their music
to be meaningful to their own
lives will find the albums to be
good enough on their own.

Miss Dessa
Directed by Eileen J. Morris
Kuntu Repertory Theater

The Kuntu Repertory Theater’s
“Celebration of Women” season is wind-
ing down to an end this week with
Shirley M. Hardy—Leonard’s play “Miss
Dessa.” Eileen J. Morris,who is, the artis-
tic director of the Ensemble Theater in

Houston, and a close collaborator with.

Pitt’s famous Vemell Lillie, has taken on
the job of director for this story about a
schoolteacher working with gang mem-
bers and students. The performances are
billed as a tribute to Helen Faison and
Valerie McDonald. Morris has extensive
experience on the regional and profes-
sional stage with starring roles in the
Ensemble Theater’s productions of

August Wilson’s “Two Trains Running” _

and “A Piano Lesson.” She has won a
Giorgee Award for best actress for her
work in “A Raisin in the Sun” and also
appeared in Oliver Stone’s JFK. “Miss
Dessa” stars Karla Washington as Miss
Dessa and Leo Beatty, Sage Berlin, and
Esrick O. McCartha. The Houston
Chronicle gave it the distinction of say-
ing that the play left “the audience in
stitches.”

“Miss Dessa” previews tonight and
tomorrow at 8 p.m. and opens Saturday,
March 22, at 8 p.m. at the Masonic

Temple Auditorium, 4227 Fifth Avenue,’

across from the Cathedral of Learning.

Thursday, March 20, I997

 

Thursday through
Sunday, through Saturday, April 5, with
performances at 8 p. m. and 4 p.m. mati-
nees on Sundays. General tickets are
$12, and student tickets are $8.

The show runs

In other Pitt theater news, lab pro-
ductions are starting this weekend and
will continue for the rest of the semester.
Tonight’s opening of the double bill,
“Medusa’s Tale” and “Finding the
Sun,” starts off the shows, which work
on meager budgets, unbelievably short
rehearsal periods, and which usually pro-
vide the best University work of the
semester. Directed by Mike Pushkar,
“Medusa’s Tale” is a contemporary piece
by Carol S- Lachof about what Greece
really was about (all Afrocentric scholars
are invited) and stars Andy Allen, Ashley

‘Wells, Suzarme Simpson, Brenda King,

and Josh Banta. Chris Kirsh is directing
the other part of the tandem, “Finding the

Sun” by Edward Albee, which stars Jess '

Milspan, Grady Provence, Kelly Pryke,
and Danielle Dybiec.

Medusa ’s Tale and Finding the Sun
open tonight at 8 p.m. at the Pit Theater
and run until Saturday, March 22, with
perfomrances Thursday through Sunday
at 8 p.m. and an additional 2 p.m. per-
formance on Saturday, 22 March. Tickets
are $3.

Luteﬁsk is a strange little band

When customers walk into the Lava
Lounge, they are treated to an eccentric but
friendly atmosphere. ‘

Although one customer was saying the
bar stools were “unscoochable,” they do
have conrfortable booths and chairs to sit on.
The artwork inside the bar was done in the
basement of the Oakland Beehive. Tim
Kaulen and Raymond Applebee were
among the group of local artists who collab-
orated for almost a year to complete the
sculpted interior of the lounge. The art is
strange, but it deﬁnitely has feeling. The
glass- and metal-work is colored in oranges
and reds like lava ﬂows and rock sculptures
from Mars.

The Lava Lounge is a small club on the
South Side. It is open Monday through
Saturday. It’s owned by Scott Kramer. and
Steve Zimotf, who also own the South Side
and Oakland Beehives. There’s something
going on almost every night, with Monday
and Wednesday probably being their slow-
est nights. Their happy hour is from 4:30 to
6:30 p.m. ‘

There are cover charges on Tuesdays,
Thursdays, Fridays, and Saturdays. It’s $3
on Tuesdays and Fridays. On Saturdays, it’s
$2. Thursdays are band nights, so it varies
from week to week.

The line—up is different every night.
Mondays are FB.I night. F.B.I stands for
Food and Beverage Industry night. Any
liquor that starts with or has an F, B, or an I
in its name is $1 otf. Now, the cool thing
about this deal is that it’s for the call drinks.
For people who don’t know what that
means, it’s the expensive stuff like Finlandia
orAbsolut. ‘

Tuesdays are the club kid nights. DJ.
Spike is the man on the tables. Be prepared
to be crowded and suffocated. It’s fun (I’ve
been there), but if you’re not one for crowds,

pick another night.

Wednesday nights are for the Latin
lovers. D.J. Miguel spins Latin music all
night long.

Thursday night sponsors a different
band every week, so check your local list-
ings for details. .

Friday has Frankie Capri. Now Chris
(who wouldn’t give me his last name) who

works the door, said that Frankie Capri is ’

“sorta like an Elvis entertainer.” You’ll just
have to brave it to see it.

Saturdays are the best night of the week
in my opinion. You have to love ‘70s funk

The food leaves much to be desired. I
don’t think a cup of couscous with lentils
(you add hot water) is Very tempting with a
glass of beer. But for you coffee and espres-
so lovers, it is not just a “beerhive.” Oh, you
also get a complimentary thirnbleful of
peanuts. ,

Thebeerandcocktails arealittle pricey.
Domestics are $2.25 a bottle, and for
imports or rnicrobrews, the most you pay is
$3.75. For cocktails, the well drinks are
$2.75 and the call drinks are $3.75. The
drawback is that they don’t have anything on
draft.

In talking to the patrons, most of whom
had been there before and really liked the
bar. The bartender, Ethan, and the doorman,
Chris, both said that they get a really mixed
crowd It varies a lot from night to night.
Duquesne students John Johnson and
Kumar Ramanathan clearly enjoyed the
atmosphere. It was Johnson’s ﬁrst time at the
bar. “It’s the best bar I’ve ever been in,” he
said. Another customer, Jeff Stirnrnel said,
‘The clientele is more my type. I would say
it is the best bar on the South Side.”

The Lava lounge is located at 2204
East Carson Street.

presence.” Although they may not be the
only band (how can one forget the 1985 ’s
wonderful grimacing?), they certainly do

bring down the house when playing live.’

“No, I Don’t Sink So, Asso,” the second
track on their seven inch, is a great exam-
ple of their live power, and I’m glad it’s on
the record. Jumbo destroys this song live
by playing off each other while managing
to keep it tight as it becomes more chaotic,
almost spinning out of control. This seven
inch gives a great sample of what Jumbo

- has to offer. But the Jumbo set list has

many more songs, so you should check
them outlive.

Don’t miss out on the live music hap-
penings going on right here in Pittsburgh.
These bands are proof of DlY’s fruition.
Listen, support, and celebrate their well—
deserved victory in the good ﬁght. The
Jumbo seven inch is on Team Skinny,
3641 Willet Rd., Pgh., PA 15227. Both

 FROM PAGE 15 

the Shale and Jumbo records are distrib-
uted by Peas Kor Records, P.O. Box
8116, Pgh., PA 15217. The 1985’s sound is
due in part to the meticulous recording of
+/- Studio’s Todd Doehring, who seems
to have been recording everyone and his
mother lately. There is no address for a
label in the l985’s release, but they’re on
Pop Bus, which is run by Manny
Theiner. Manny coordinates a lot of
shows and sometimes sells records, includ-
ing Pop Bus stuff. All three record jackets
boast the highly stylized art of Third
Termite printing, which you may recog-
nize from its striking Orgone Cinema ﬂy-
ers.

Don’t miss out on the live—music hap-
penings going on right here in Pittsburgh.
These bands are proof of musical fruition
through independent means. Listen, sup-
port, and celebrate their well-deserved vic-
tory in the DIY cause.
