With the holiday break in classes. little has oc-
curred concerning the charges the Black Action So-
ciety (BAS) lodged against the Universitys Ath-
letic Department during the fall finals‘ period.

The Chancellors office has forwarded two re-

sponses to BAS Chairman Gamaliel Ballard. but
the campus‘ Black community has indicated dis-

satisfaction with the reactions.

Basically the BAS has charged the Athletic De-
partment with racism in three areas—recruitment.
development through the opportunity to play and

publicity. -

The BAS also revealed that a meeting with-Ath-
letic Director Casimir Myslinski was held prior to
the Pitt-West Virginia football game in October. Ob-

jectives were presented, but because of “negative”
reaction the objectives were revised for public pre-

mittiees;

The objectives were:

Femirtists Propose Institute

by BILL GORMLEY
News Editor

Feminists at the University
are pressing for an Institute of
Feminist Studies, to include a

V Child Development Center.

At a meeting Wednesday after-
noon with Executive Assistant
Chancellor Jack Freeman and
other administrators. representa-
tives of the University Committee
for Women‘s Rights <UCWR). the
Council for Womens Rights
<CWR). and the National Organ-
ization for Women (NOW) asked
the administration for what June
Rubel. a member of all three
groups. termed "basic. sustaining
organizational funds.“

“SEED MONEY" REQUESTED

The women explained that they
were initially interested in ob-
taining “seed money“—$69.000—

Applications are currently be- 4
ing accepted for the positions
of editor and business mana-
ger of The Pitt News. Applica-
tions may be picked up in
Room 405, Student Union.

erships of Student Government

tend one of the following meet-
ings in Room H9, Student Un- ‘
ion: Friday, Jan. 8, at -4 p.m.,
or Tuesday, Jan. ‘T2, at 6- I

   

  

to launch Phase I of their pro-
gram.

Freeman, who termed the meet-
ing “most productive,” said the
session changed “some” of his
“attitudes.” He refused to com-
mit for the administration, how-
ever, until Chancellor Posvar has
had the opportunity to study the
proposal in detail. V M

Reading from a prepared state-
ment. Judy Kapsal of IJCWR ex-
plained that the women expect
the Child Development Center "to
complement experience in the
family” and emphasized that it
must provide more than custo-
dialcare.

"Without child care, the Uni-
versity systematically discrimin-
ates against women with child-
rearing responsibilities." .\Irs.
Kapsal read. Ellie Smeal of NOW
added that a Child Development
Center is likely to "decrease
turnover and increase produc-
tivity.“

SLOW EVOLUTION
UNPALATABLE

The women stressed they will
“reject any Child Development
Center which tolerates or encour-
ages sexism.“ And they refused
to consider a Child Development
Center without the Institute for
Feminist Studies, contending it
“would lead to the slowness of
evolution or the tragedy of revolu-
tion."

en called their proposal “a uni-
que opportunity to exhibit concern
for women." Terming it “the cul-
mination of a dream.“ Mrs. Rubel
said that "Pitt has been picked out
for national focus by NOW.”

 

VICE CHANCELLORS Bernard Ko-
bosky and Edison Montgomery lis-

quest an Institute of Feminist

Studies.

According to the women, the
Child Development Center would
eventually cost around $660,000
per year. Since tuition charges
would be levied on families able
to pay, however, the administra-
tion would not be required to pro-
vide that amount. “A substantial
number of participants would be

paying a substantial portion of the V

fee,”,EIlie Smeal estimated. V

Racism”  

As evidence of racism, Ballard
and the BAS have noted the tre-
mendous lack of Blacks in Pitt’s
athletic history, the failure of cur-
rent Black football players to be
selected to post-season games
while the “encouraging of a white
quitter existed, the continued pub-
licity for an injured white All-

American candidate, and a total
of 276 lines of copy for Blacks
in The Pitt News—compared to
“countless” lines for white ath-
letes.

Though names were not men-

a reasonable presentation of grie-
vances.

“It is true that historically the
University’s athletic programs
have been largely-dominated by
whites. It also ought to be noted.
however, that significant progress
has been made in recent years.“

Ballard admitted that the num
ber of Black athletes at Pitt has
increased. but he disagrees about
the amount of’ progress.

"quitter“ was understood to be

lected to two post season games
despite a mid-season injury, and
the white All-American candidate
was Ralph Cindrich.

"It's a relative comparison." he
said. "We want a positive step.
Sure. there are more Blacks. but
the problem of racism still exists.“

ed that the chargers were incor-
rect because the selection to All-
Star games and the publicity is
beyond the departments control.
B U I. L E T I N !

Members of Local 29 of the
Service Employees Internation-
al Union voted last night to re-
iect the final contract offer of
the University, The Union,
whose three-year contract with
the University expired Dec. 31,
rejected the offer by a 165- ‘
140 count. No definite strike
date was established.

Myslinski said he doesn’t see
the racism.

‘'1 really don't know why
they're staring the turmoil.“ he
mentioned at his conference. “I
wish I did. Then I could do some-
thing.

 

“My personal opinion‘? I think. 
this will level off. People will '
start realizing there is no dis-
crimination. or there‘s little dis-
crimination. Heck. I‘m trying my
darndest to eliminate it. There
are 434 athletes at Pitt——44 are
Black. That‘s about ten per cent.
We're not trying to do it on a per-
centage basis. it just happens that
way."

The University employs 432
members of the Union, includ-
ing custodians, groundskeep-
ers, elevator opera tors, maids,
ianitors, and food service em-
ployees in the nurses’ residence.

Student Liability
Grants Honored _

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Associate Editor

‘(Editor's Note: The following is the first installment of a two part
series dealing with the financial situation of the University.)

Despite legislative recalcitrance, the University has opted‘
to honor state scholarship awards for the Winter Term. Student
Aid Director Charles Dees, Jr., however, admitted in an inter- .
view that his office——along with the rest of the University--is

operating on borrowed time.

Although the aid has been made available contingent upon the _
promises of the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency ‘

(PHEAA ). the Student Aid office has taken steps to protect itself.

Included with each state scholarship authorization is a notice." I
warning recipients that “if for some reason the (states fiscal) prob- ' I

lems are not resolved and the second half of your award is not funded
by the General Assembly. you will be held liable for payment to the Uni-

versity for that portion of your tuition that was to be covered by your I 

state scholarship."

Dees’ office has set April 30 as deadline date after which the Uni- ' 
versity will be unable to operate without PHEAA, funds. He estimated:
that 3,563 students-nearly half of the undergraduate population-- f
would be affected by a state failure to follow through with funding. The?" '

figures involved approach $2,200,000. 1

Since only state scholarships are refundable, students entitled t'ol_.:

refunds must wait until the legislative impasse is resolved to collect. I

While Dees refused to definitely commit himself, he was “hopeful”
that the aid would be forthcoming so that the University could avoid

enforcing its student liability policy. i t if .i

In other quarters, an administrative spokesman suggested that
“it’s too early to make an observation on what the legislature will do”
when it reconvenes or. the 18th of this month I it‘

The spokesman inisted that “there islittle reason for concern at V’ 
this point." although he revealed that tiae t‘::ia:‘ersity needs more than ’

$300 million to continue functioning on a normal level. y

At a sit-in on Dec. 11. members
of three feminist groups organiz-
ed what one demonstrator term-
ed “the only child care facility at
Pitt."

At 10 a.m.. about 30 women and
children representing the Nation-
al Organization for Women. the
University Committee for Wom-
ens Rights and the Council for
Women's Rights found their en-
trance to the Chancellors office
barred by workmen who were in
the process of remodeling the of-
fice.

After consulting with the head
of security. the feminists decided
to move to the area near the
ground floor elevators of the Ca-
thedral. where they distributed a
two page list of demands concern-
ing a day care center to passers-
by.

Included in the list of demands
was a request that an amount
equal to that currently being spent
on male athletes be appropriated
for child care and be presented
with fiscal demands to legisla-
ture by Jan. 15. The leaflet stated
“that a large amount, approxi-
mately $1 million annually, is
spent on male athletes in the form
of recruiting and scholarships.
We demand that an equal audit
be made and that an equal amount
be spent in support of woman in
the University.”

The list of demands also stated
that “the University recently al-
located $250,000 for remodeling
the Chancellors office and $800 -

  Demanded

000 for installing astro-turf in the
stadium" and the women reason-
ed that child care centers could
already be in operation if such
funds were made available.

The leaflet went on to demand
child development centers "lo-
cated on or near campus. open to
all members of. the University
community. open for children of
all ages" and under the direction
of “a feminist qualified in child
development."

At 11:30 a.m. Jack Freeman,
executive assistant chancellor,
confronted the feminists and ask-
ed them to adjourn to the German
Room, where he discussed their
demands.

The Pitt News contacted Dave
Powers. assistant to the Chancel-
lor on Academic Affairs. to learn

the administrations reaction to.

the feminists‘ demands. He point-
ed out that Elizabeth Schneewind
has already been working on a day
care center for a year and added
that state regulations on such
centers have restricted the Uni-
versitys progress.

Powers related that “we hope
to encourage legislation that will
make employees.and students eli-
gible for the use of child care cen-
ters.“

 

Vice Chancellor for Student
Affairs Bernard Kobosky will
be available for questions from
students this Wednesday from
3 p.m.‘on in the Student Union
Supper Room.

Are Pitt Athletics Racist?  

BAS Charges

(Editor's Note: The following text is made up of excerpts from the
second statement of the BAS, which was sent to the administration, the
Athletic Department and the news media.)

Pitt has fielded a varsity football team for 80 years from 1890-
1970 and prior to the last few seasons only 12 Black men have won the
traditional varsity letter.

Jack Sutherland turned out All-Americans with regularity «I927-
1937> during his tenure as coach but not one Black man was even
permitted to don the blue and gold. Sutherland. an immigrant ol onl_y
two years before entering Pitt. believed that no Black man was good
enough to_play for his team. His philosophy lives on. The athletic de-
partment selected an All-Time Pitt team from 1910-1968 and not
one Black man is mentioned. Bobby Grier was the only Black player to
ever play for Pitt in a bowl game.

Nineteen hundred and sixty-three was Pitts best record since the
late 305. They posted a 9-1 record and were rated third nationally.
That same year the team was composed of only two Blacks. Eric Crab-
tree and Jim Jones. ' ’

In the entire history of the University, the football team has never
-had a Black team captain. This past season rather than name Lloyd
Weston a Black All-American candidate, captain; it was decided not to
have a captain. Weston, a proven team leader and consistent steller
performer, provided the impetus throughout the season—yet, Coach
Carl DePasqua complained to the Press “that Pitt was down psycholog-
ically because they needed a leader and captain.”

Even though such a small number of Blacks lettered in football.
there are three ebony gridders listed in the Pitt All-Time record book.
Jimmy Joe Robinson :1945-49): Yards Intercepted Pass; Yards Punt Return.

Eric Crabtree (1963-65): Yards Kick Off Return. Career 1.068.
Dave Garnett (1966-1970): Kick Off Returns; One Game 220 Yards.

There has been only one Black player representing Pitt in any post
season bowl game in the history of the University. There have been 100
white players selected to post season honors and bowl games com-
pared to only one Black during 80 years of football competition.

In the history of football at Pitt there has been over 3,200. white
gridders and only 22 Blacks who received varsity letters. This is a

University Responds 1,

(Editor’s Note: The following ex-
cerpts were taken from the Admin-
istrative statement made to the
Black Action Society after learning
of their charges.)

The University has reviewed
the press statement issued today
by the Black Action Society con-
cerning L'niversity athletic pro-
grams. For the most part. the
statement is carefully considered
and a reasonable presentation of
grievances. As the BAS itself has
indicated. a dialogue on this sub-
ject between the University Black
community and responsible Uni-
versity administrators has been
going on for some time and it has
been our perception that progress
was being made. although we
agree that much remains to be
done.

1. The Chancellor has agreed
that the appointment of a senior
Athletic Department administra-
tive staff member who is Black
would be useful step toward solv-
ing some of the problems of Black
athletes. This person should have
specific functional responsibil-
ities will depend on the candi-
dates own background and inter-
est. The athletic director. how-
ever. must have overall respon-
sibility for programs of his de-
partment.

2. The Chancellor has agreed
that some expansion of both the
Senate and the I'niversity Ath-
letic Committees is desirable. The

Why Black
Students Are

by DON MARBURY
Editor

If two cross country runners of equal ability

start off on a foot race from the same starting
point, only one of the runners is forced to wear
one pound ankle weights, who is likely to win?

Let’s suppose that this hypothetical race is a

very very long one, and after every fifteen
‘minutes or whenever he mood strikes them,

someone takes, say, half an ounce off the

i weights. As the weight on his legs decreases
the runner moves faster and faster, but even

though he is progressing, he sees his opponent

running way ahead of him; progressing at the
rate he wants to.

But the hampered runner still holds his own.
He is determined to catch his opponent even
with the handicap with which he must run. He
complains. He says it is not a fair race, but he
is told that he has no right to complain, because
the ankle weight is being lessened more anc‘

more, and is reminded that things are a lot

better for him now than when he started the
race.

BUT HE looks down the course, and he can
just barely make out the easily moving figure
of his opponent ever progressing . . ever
heightening his lead, and this time he screams
at the top of his lungs that this is not a fair race.
Someone hears him, and either through guilt or
fear that sympathizers will hear. takes an
ankle weight completely off one leg.

He is at first elated. He picks up speed, and
he notices that compared to the rate that he
had been moving previously, he is almost
flying. But then he wonders how fast he could
move if he didn't have the other ankle weight
on. He bends to take it off, while bystanders on
the course call him a “poor sport", and even
threaten to try and stop him.

But the weight is locked on, and while he
uses all his might against it: seeing it slowly

‘yield, he realizes that he is losing to much time.

and that his opponent is still getting further and
further away.

He starts running with the loosened ankle
weight, and looks down the course for the small
profile of his opponent, but it isn‘t there.

OUR LIVES, just like with the two runners.
no progression can be completely equal. unless
they were begun equally in the first place. and
if the things that cause an unequal life
progression in the first place are not destroyed
completely, instead of step by step partially
deleted, nothing really changes.

Black athletes at the University of
Pittsburgh have attacked the administration
and athletic department, because they feel they
have been dealt with unfairly, because they are
Black, and I agree with and support their posi-
tion. I agree because I am Black, and I know of
the many deliberate, unconscious, and amoral
forms that white racism takes on, but I also
recognize that the status quo of the University.
no matter how much one points to the great
strides made by it, only changes when a student
or outside catalyst is provided.

It is impossible to be brought up in the
United States of America and not be a racist. I
will concede that there are varying degrees of
racism (discrimination against a race of
people, whether , it be deliberate or
unconscious, because of differences between

\ them and you), but we all are guilty.

PITT’S athletic department, just like the
University, just like America, is indeed racist.
The statistics, which both sides in the issue
were in agreement on concerning the total
number of white athletes and the total of blacks
who competed for the University, obviously
show this.

But Casimer Myslinski, Carl DePasquale.
and Wesley Posvar should not be maligned as
perpetrators of this racism. Their biggest
faults are that they know no other way of
dealing with change—-of purporting
equality—of closing an every widening racial
gap, than through the status quo that America
says they must.

I talked with Myslinski, He is a man. To
Casimir Myslinski he treats all athletes the
same no matter what color they are, but he is
not aware that it is impossible for him to do
this while working in the framework and
structure that he is now.

DePASQUAL probably sincerely believes
that he played his best men. His job depends on
him doing so. But in a case where you have a
Black and a white ball player vying for the
same position, if they are of equal ability, can
Carl be entirely sure that the race of the player
didn’t enter into the picture? Given the thought
patterns of our racist society—given the fact
that he is a middle-aged white adult, brought up
under a society made by racism is the

ssibility not apparent that he couldn’t have

n completely unbiased in his selections?

All I am saying is that there is the distinct
possibility that decisions concerning the use of
Black athletes on Pitt's teams may have been
made because of color. It is a very distinct pos--
sibility, and is probably unavoidable unless . . .

‘ . . . as the Black Action Society has proposed,

someone is brought in coming from the Black

Pitt llews Series

,4 flistory of ﬁrplaitzztizm

by MARK COHEN
Staff Columnist

(Editor's Note: This is the first of a
series of articles on Vietnam. The source
material is the book, The Indochina Story,
by the Committee of Concerned Asian
Scholars. Large segments are drawn direct-
ly from the book.)

“We have fought a thousand years and
we will fight another thousand years if
need be." Vietnames nationalists are not
exaggerating in making this claim. They
have defended their independence against
the Chinese. the Mongols. Thais. Euro-
peans. Japanese and the United States.

Before the arrival of the French. Viet-
namese life was regulated according to
custom within the confines of the village.
Each village was incorporated into the
national community by the emperor. The
village was required to pay taxes. pro-
vide labor for public works and men for
the army.

Within the village. a strong coopera-
tive tradition existed. Although there was
a village elite which exploited the peas-
antry. extremes of "poverty and wealth
were avoided. education was widespread
and ownership of land was dispersed
among the majority of the people. Also.
the villages maintained communal lands.
A part of these lands was set aside for
the support of the old and the poor.

HOWEVER, such a society did not suit
the desires of France. By the 18905
France controlled Indochina. By first
sending in Catholic missionaries. and
with naval support. France took advan-
tage of a split in the Vietnames dynastic
rivalries. France cut the country into
three administrative areas (.us Laos and
Cambodia).

The French implemented a policy of
economic colonialism. The pattern of
land distribution changed to a large plan-
tation system on which the peasant could
work as a penniless ‘tenant. To insure

white athletes who are better players than
some black players. The BAS wants winning
teams as much as every other organization.
But they are concerned that a Black athlete
may not have the opportunity for development
or to compete that the white player has simply
because of the preoccupation with color which
is very much inherent in any white system.

What we've got to se is that the system is at
fault (I know, now you're probably saying
everything gets blamed on the system. Well
damn-it everything should get blamed on it).
The BAS recognizes this but they also
recognize that “the revolution" is still a ways
off. So until it comes they have submitted a
reasonable set of alternatives to combat the
inherency of socialized, institutionalized,
economized racism, in the specific area of
University of Pittsburgh athletics.

LIVE WITH BAS Chairman Gamaliel
Ballard (since I'm going to be accused of
journalistic bias anyway, you might as well
know the whole situation).

Gamaliel, like the runner at the beginning of
this little soliliquy, knows that the “ankle
weights” aren’t going to be taken off of Black
Americans because of some great revelation,
or change of heart in the white society, just yet.
But he also knows that until “the revolution
comes" we must try to combat racism in the
best preliminary way that we can.

For like that runner, Black people are
tugging at those weights with all their might
and ey are screaming.

higher profits. French administrators
created monopolies in consumer goods
in -salt and wine. By allowing the price
of salt to jump 500 per cent in 20 years.’
the salt monopoly did grave damage to
the health of the Vietnames people. des-
troying an indispensable part of their
daily diet.

It was the Japanese who first swept
European colonialists out of Southeast
Asia in 1941 incorporating it into their
"Greater East
Sphere." Yet. the Japanese left the
Vichy (French puppet government which
collaborated with the Nazis) government
run the country. This belied the Japanese
pan-Asian rhetoric.

In response. a united front of Viet-
namese nationalist groups formed In
May. 1941. the League for the Indepen-
dence of Vietnam (Viet Minh).

Its leader was Ho Chi Minh. ex—mer-
chant seaman. assistant chef in London
and photographic retoucher in Paris.
He was an eclectic thinker. at home in
French culture. persuaded by its revolu-
tionary tradition. yet deeply immersed
in Vietnames history.

IN THE 1920‘s. Ho turned to Marxism-
Lenism not as an abstract philosophy.
but as a potent tool for analyzing the
world situation and. in particular. the
plight of colonial peoples. In the 1930's.
he (now head of the Indochinese Com-
munist Party) was the most widely
known of the nationalist leaders.

During WW II. the Viet Minh estab-
lished a small territorial base in present
day North Vietnam. They did intelli-
gence work for the Allies and received
substantial aid from the American OSS
(Office of Stategic Services, the wartime
predecessor of the CIA). Toward the end
of the war. Japan removed the French
puppet government and replaced it with
Bao Dai as emperor.

With the Japanese preoccupied else-
where in the Pacific. the Viet Minh be-
gan to move. Soon the Japanese found
themselves confronted with a rapidly
spreading revolutionary movement.

Then the war ended. The Viet Minh
marched triumphantly into Hanoi and

Saigon, declaring the creation of the
Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

THE NEW regime took swift hold
among the Vietnames people. They dis-
tributed French lands and the land hold-
ings of wealthy Vietnames collaborators
among the landless peasants. Widespread
famine was wiped out within six months.
Quickly the French encouraged trend of
illiteracy was reversed. setting up new
schools. made the eight-hour working day
law in the cities. lowered taxes. nation-
alized all public utilities (previously con-
trolled by foreigners). helped the work-
ers set up their own unions. and opened
the jails to release the many thousands of
political prisoners incarcerated by the
French regime.

But this period lasted only briefly.
With aid from England. the Viet Minh
regime was toppled in 1946 and turned
back over to the French. The Viet Minh

moved to the countryside.

More Proof
ls Needed

By ED CONLEY
Sports Editor

It is impossible to say that the Pitt
Athletic Department is completely free
of racism. I believe because there are
simply too many people involved in the
operation. But the accusations leveled
by the Black Action Society (BAS) last
month say that there is a great amount
of racism. that the Athletic Department
maintains "racist policies". This still
has to be proved.

Gamaliel Ballard. chairman of the
BAS. is convinced that he has presented
enough proof after researching the sit-
uation once Black athletes. predomin-
antly football players. asked him for
assistance. He hasn‘t convinced me.

—BAS says the Black athlete is being
exploited in the specific area of recruit-
ment.

I don‘t think so. The Athletic De-
partment lists 434 athletes; 44 are Black.
Two hundred-thirty-seven (237) athletic
scholarships are awarded; 24 of them be-
long to Blacks. Fifteen other Black ath-
letes are awarded some other type of
financial aid.

These figures don't seem to indicate
racist policy in recruitment. but more
important than the numbers is the fact
that the recruiting of Blacks has im-
proved greatly in Athletic Director Cas-
imir Myslinski's two years at Pitt-
with every indication that the situation
will continue to improve.

Ballard says the numbers of Blacks
are greater than in the past. but he
claims the racism is as prevalent as
ever. All Iask is ‘where is it?‘

I don‘t think so. Certainly the ma-
jority of the 44 Black athletes have been
very important to the success of Pitt‘s
athletic squads. The particular objec-
tions in opportunity to play appear to
involve head football coach Carl De-
Pasqua. BAS seems to be sighting the
lack of one Black football players
playing time, while forgetting about
seven Blacks who gained starting posi-
tions under DePasqua. ‘

It‘s also argued that DePasqua didn‘t
put forth enough effort to gain,post-
season game berths for his Black sen-
iors. and that he didn‘t name tackle

‘Lloyd Weston captain because Weston

is Black.

DePasqua says he recommended
all of his senior starters for All-Star
games. and there is no sensible reason
to disbelieve him. A couple of Pitt‘s
Black stars should have been selected.
All of the holiday game committees
should be blasted for these oversights.

‘As far as selecting a team captain.
Carl DePasqua didn’t choose one last
year either. The Pitt coach prefers to
name game captains, and some Blacks
were included in the long list of game
captains this year.

Before mentioning the BAS‘ final
area of alleged racism. I think it is nec-
essary to say that the Black organiza-
tion should never have called defensive
back Charlie Hall a "white quitter."
His name wasn‘t mentioned, but his
identity was made very clear, and the
remark was the kind that only creates
antagonism.

—-BAS says the Black athlete is being
exploited in the specific area of develop-
ment through equal opportunity to com-
plete.

Again. I don't think so. But my opin-
ion here doesn't matter Members of the
press choose their topics for stories, not
the Pitt publicity department. Its main
task. I believe, is to keep the press
aware of the general development in the
Athletic Department.

Racist policies in the Pitt Athletic
Department? No. I don't think so. Ball-
ard and the BAS have not been able to
prove it to me. I don’t say that it can’t
be proven. though. If anyone thinks they
can convince me that the BAS charges
are valid. they are welcomed to come to
the Pitt News Sports office to discuss
the matter. I'd prefer that_they go to
the Athletic Director's office, though.
Maybe the problems will get solved that
way. V I

 

  

Editor. The Pitt News:

In your Nov. 4 issue. a letter
from Joan Derrick contained a
quote from a Planned Parenthood
pamphlet dated August. 1963.
and a quote from The American
Journal of Public Health, 1960. by
Dr. Mary Calderone. f'ormer med-
ical director of Planned Parent-
hood-World Population.

The writer challenged the pre-
sent Planned Parenthood position
on abortion. in light of these
quotes.

May I say first that both of
these quotes were taken from
discussions about Illegal Abortion

and the very dangers inherent in

these. The quote from Dr. Cal-
derone was from the article. "If-
legal Abortion as a Public Health
Problem." published in the Amer-
ican Journal of Public Health vol-
ume of July. 1960. and while
it is frequently used b_v opponents
of abortion law repeal as argu-
ments in support of their case. the
title of the article is not mention-
ed by them.

Anti-abortion stand based on old ideas

is 10 years old. In many areas of
medicine. knowledge has greatly
increased and techniques have
greatly improved in this last dec-
ade—as has knowledge in many
other disciplines.

It makes just as much sense to
quote a paper written years ago
which points up the medical im-
possibilities of open heart sur-
gery. Or papers describing the
great risks of surgical patients if
they are not kept immobile for a
week or 10 days after the opera-
tion.

As Mrs. Derrick undoubtedly‘
knows. open heart surgery is skill-
fully and safely done in many gen-
eral hospitals today and saves
hundreds of lives. and surgery pa-
tients ras well as women who
have just had a baby) are gotten
on their feet within hours after
the operation or delivery: yet it
would be eas_v to produce a num-
ber of respectable medical arti-
clcs attacking these procedures.

Dr. Calderone has this to say
about the 1960 article: “The
1960 American Journal of Public

Health paper based on the find-
ings of the 1955 Abortion Confer-
ence is no longer relevant. The 10
ye_ars intervening have seen great
changes in knowledge and revision
in attitudes about abortion.

Were I to be writing a similar
paper today. reviewing these new
attitudes and findings emanating
from the American Medical Asso-
ciation and American Psychia-
tric Association and other scien-
tific bodies. I would not be making
the statement made by me in 1960.
for the evidence supporting the
statement then has been super-
seded.

Finally. Joan Derrick should
also know that Planned Parent-
hood does not advocate abortion
as a birth control measure, but
does believe that every woman
has the right to determine if she
will or will not bear a child. and
that abortion should be a matter
between the woman and her
physician.

I would like to thank the editors of

fairness with which they have
treated a highly controversial
subject.

During my stay here at the L'ni-

the emotional depth involved in
anything concerning the military

ment which has been accorded me
in the program by the editors and
staff of The Pitt News has been in
keeping with the highest stan-
dards of journalism and objective
reporting.

My assignment to the Universi-
ty of Pittsburgh has been the most
memorable ‘and rewarding of my
whole career. I take with me some
rare and beautiful insights of what
the l'niversity represents and
what it is trying to do.

I recognize the philosophical di-

Calley’s fate

Editor. The Pitt News:

This is written is response to
the letter to the editor in the Dec.
4 edition of The Pitt News, titled.
Lt. Calley——American Hero.

It is not right to condemn or de-
fend a man on the basis of emo-
tionalism. Hughes implies that
the “Commie-casters of WJAS
and other rap shows“ are doing
this by "screaming for this offi-
cers blood. "

May I remind you that you are
doing the very same thing you ac-
cuse others of doing. when you
defend Lt. Calley as being "a
hero.” The only difference is that
you think they are wrong to emo-
tionalize guilt while you think you
are right to emotionalize inno-
cence. This is not the way proper
justice is conducted.

Your opinions frighten me.
How are you justified in saying.

those individuals with whom I
most strongly disagree.

I am totally convinced that the
future of our nation and mankind
are intertwined with the fate and
fortune of our great universities
such as the University of Pitts-
burgh. I leave the University with
my faith totally renewed. Our
University and our nation are in
good hands.

I have never worked with a
group such as our faculty. our
Chancellor. our
and our students. who are more
committed to addressing the prob-
lems which beset mankind; nor
have I ever known a group better
prepared to meet and resolve the
challenges which we face together
as a nation.

I am more convinced than ever ~

that we need each other. As a mili-
tary officer. I am totally commit-

ted to preservation of the free- A I

free inquiry and the search for
truth the guiding light of our Uni-

Bad reactions

.  A I submit a few of the studies

K. Nordmeyer (1946) observed

‘$ , that reactive depression occurred

an_ abortion.

 

 

l3r. Selma Siegfried, a German
psychiatrist, in a 1951 study states

that in a group of women she
-studied who had been granted a
therapeutic abortion, only 28 per
cent showed no reaction to the op-
eration psychologically. The rest

3‘. _k  N V

of the group showed reaction
ranging from feelings of guilt and
remorse to unfavorable altera-
tions in sexuality and motherhood.

In a 1962 study. Dr. Sydney
Bolter states bluntly that "the au-
thor (Bolter) has never seen a
patient who has not had guilt feel-
ings about a previous therapeutic
abortion."

Concerning the child-rearing
function of women he observes.
“When this function is interfered
with, we see all sorts of emotion-
al disorders and certainly the cli-
max of these disorders is reached
at the menopause . . 

Finally, psychologists Francis
Kane and John Ewing (1968)
propose that “it is believed that
further liberalization of legisla-
tion regarding abortion will pro-
vide more, rather than fewer.
problems for psychiatrists.“

While. given modern surgical
techniques. sterility is very un-
likely. it has been noted that fol-

lowing a therapeutic abortion im-

pairment in normal sexual func-
tioning is not uncommon (Santay-
ano Medrano. 1948; V. C. Hamil-
ton, 1941).

These studies therefore support
Joan Derrick's position which is
attacked with an unfounded ap-
peal to scientific “authority."

A short trip to the Langley li-
brary will enable any doubter to
check the veracity of these state-
ments.

Therefore, it is very common
for women who have experienced
a therapeutic abortion to suffer
psychological disturbances rather
than "pure and simple relief."

Editor. The Pitt News:

Professor Robert Snow. chair-
man of the Music Department.
and I discussed the situation of
the Marching Band at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh some time ago.

My own view is that it should be
open to women as well as men. I
wrote a memorandum to Profes-
sor Snow on Oct. 23. 1970. say-
ing that unless it was opened to
women the College of Arts and
Sciences would not continue to
award credit for participation.

Very truly yours.

basketball. but there are four
Black varsity players on the
squad now. In wrestling. two
black athletes appear this year in
a varsity squad of ten. Of the 22
blacks who have lettered in foot-
ball. eight received their letters
last year.

These figures indicate. at least.
that the University has made pro-
gress in recent years in recruit-
ment of black athletes. The Uni-
versity also recognizes. however.
that black athletes. like other
black members of society. have
suffered in the past from institu-
tionalized racism. not only here
but throughout both professional
and amateur sports. We view
these problems with serious con-
cern and it is our intention to cre-
ate a climate in which equality of
opportunity and treatments exists
for black and whiteathletes.

- Feminist Proposal

(Continued from Page I)

Should the administration
agree to establish the Child De-
velopment Center. the women
pledged to solicit financial sup-
port from foundations and the fed-
eral government to defray ex-
penses.

MONTGOMERY SOLICITS
ADVICE

Commenting on the proposal.
Vice Chancellor of Finance Edi-
son Montgomery argued that the
administration can‘t respond con-
clusively to the women's request
until it becomes clear “how much
money the LTniversity will get
from the state."

He also asked the women where
they expected the administration
to gets funds for the Child Devlop-
ment Center. “Would you have us
cut back on enrollment?” he
queried. “Or would you have us
reduce our athletic budget?” The
latter, Montgomery said, is “high
on my list.” The women, how-
ever, were reluctant to suggest
where expenses might be cut to
permit the implementation of
their proposal.

A major point of disagreement
proved to be the women‘s desire
for an Institute for Feminist
Studies. The Institute. which
would encompass "teaching. re-
search. and consulting.“ would be
devoted to “the study. interpre-
tation. and evaluation emerging
patterns of social change and be-
havior.“

The women called for the im-
mediate appointment of an insti-
tute director. a child development
center director. a director of re-
search. and educational develop-
ment director. and an equal em-
ployment opportunity director.
They also urged that a Vice Chan-
cellor for Womens Activities and
Educational Programs. who
would report directly to the Chan-
cellor. be named. The Vice Chan-
cellor. they maintained. should
"be elected every four years from
the faculty of the Institute for

A “KNOTTY PROBLEM”

Broaching what the women pro- '

posed is a “knotty problem." As-
sociate Provost Donald Hender-

son suggested. He felt that there"

must be a link between the Insti-
tute for Feminist Studies and the
traditional academic structure"
for the proposal to be feasible.

direct contradiction to the idea of competition athletics and a clear

case of overt racism.

Prior to the 1968 season. only three Blacks had won varsity let-
ters in basketball at Pitt. Julius Peques. 1955. was the first Black man
to letter in basketball in the school's history. Since then only six Blacks
have won varsity letters and out of 1.002 basketball players only

seven Blacks have lettered at Pitt.

Track at Pitt has been a real
foot race. It is only the sport at
Pitt which has permitted a Black

captain to prevail. Over the years.

there have been 31 Blacks let-
tering in track compared to 800
whites. The Black representation
in track is the most in any varsi-
ty sport within the University.

The other varsity sports pro-
grams are and have been void of
Blacks. No Black athlete has let-
tered in any sport other than foot-
ball. basketball. and track. Yes.

varsity swimming. tennis. golf. ;

baseball. gymnastics and until
this year wrestling. have never
had a Black man win a varsity let-
ter.

HAIR

It was cold and damp on open-
ing night at the Nixon, but the
crowd that gathered, in mass, to
see this “tribal love rock musi-
cal” were warm and energetic.
There was some gentle shoving-
the doorman looked a little confus-

ed. I don’t think he’s seen the old

Nixon so alive and full of excit-
ment in many years.

A rock band played in the lobby

 -some kids screamed here and

there~—as the crowd (young and

I old alike) moved into the theatre

to see what has become the most
successful theatrical phenomenon
of the century.

Its grosses are in the millions.
the number of productions simul-

taneously going on around the

world and in the states number in
the 20’s, and the people flock by
the thousands wherever it plays.

As a production of the theatre.
it is unique and far from tradi-

tional . . . in fact, it is a daring

new concept of lights. sounds. and

words that by Broadway‘s stan-

dards shouldn’t have worked. but

‘has, since its opening at the Bilt-_
more Theatre in New York in

April of 1968. '

Hair, calls forth the cry for
communication in its message of
the “love generation.” One cannot
help but be swept up with the
magical reality-—the auro——of be-
ing together with peace and love
and arms stretched out, as each
player reaches out for the other
on that stage and to every mem-
ber of the audience.

Play an Instrument?

An All-women-’s music group

the traditional separation between
play and audience as it seems to
say “lets fill up with one another"
. . . as it seems to say (in its skill-
fully meshed sequence of com-
ment and song unfolding with
words of injustice. love. sex.
peace. war in all its brutality)
“this is the way it is and isn‘t hap-
pening." It is a physical and men-
tal experience—a combination of
gut and mind.

The lyrics are poetic and perti-
nent telling of the longing of a gen-
eration of youth. who call for so-
cial reform in a world that leaves
them empty and meaningless.

The score is comprised of some
of the most outstanding music of
today—five hits in thetop ten, in
cluding “Aquarius,” “Let the Sun
Shine In,” and “Hair.”

The cast is fresh. energetic and
unusually talented —— coming
across with as much realness as
the story they tell.

Lighting by Jules Fisher is ex-
citing and a fine example for
Pittsburgh audiences of what good
lighting is! It is skillfully matched
to the mood and movement of the
show second by second.

The set is absolutely fine, and
the choreography—very special—-
the best combination of the the-
atrical media's that Pittsburgh
has seen since I can remember.

Hair transcends the boundry of.

 

Unusually so. if I had not known
it was a road show. by its quality
alone I‘d have thought I was
sitting in New York. From snow
flakes to Strobes-—from smoke to
fire to brightly colored costumes
it is well put together. well staged
and extremely entertaining. Its
message? . . . our times. our to-
morrows. our todays. our wrongs.
where we are going.

Clive Karnes of the New York
Times called it “a musical of to-
day rather than yesterday." I call

it "a story of someday." There

are two kinds of people who will

see Hair. Some who will leave the:

theatre feeling good about what
was created for them but only to
leave it back on Liberty Ave. as
they return to the world that they
sit in  . a world Hair talks and
sings about as the "never should
be again.“

The others will cry a little when
Hair is over—in realization that
“what it’s all about” is still yet to
be. Their hearts will yearn for
“now.” They will be reminded
that their work is not yet finish-
ed and that Hair is what it’s all
about.

Walking out into the lobby you
can kind of tell the two apart.
There are some who seem a little
like those on stage . . . and others
who have left those feelings in-
side-—whose blank stares and

if Hair for them is not a dream
that they just wait for. but do

The Fantasticks, a parable

about love. opened at the Sullivan
Street Playhouse in Greenwich
Village. New York. on May 3.
1960. At this writing it is still
playing to capacity houses. mak-
ing it the longest running off-
Broadway show in theatrical his-
tory.

Who can explain this remark-
able longevity? Librettist-lycri-
cist, Tom Jones, has some valid-
sounding theories of his own. He is
convinced that The Fantasticks
could not have succeeded had it
been merely an airy, bubbly con-
fection with no serious purpose
behind it.

Audiences. he feels. have been

able to penetrate the gaiety and.

mockery to appreciate the under-
lying philosophy inherent not only
in the story. but in the musical se-
lections as well.

On August 3. 1969. The Fan-
tasticks opened for a week-long
run at Barnard College. Producer
Lore Noto was in the audience—-
fell in love with the sh0w~—and

By JAN FRY

Top breaststroker. Al Morris has quit the Pitt swimming team.
and others are threatening to throw in the towel.

"It was a mutual understanding between the two of us."

stated

Pitt Coach Bill Grant concerning Morris‘ resignation. "He just fig-
ured he didn't have the zip in order to meet the grind. It‘s tough to

stay with swimming and it‘s not

American caliber to quit before
their career is over. "

Morris saw the situation in a
different light however. "It‘s not
that I didn’t have the zip. I lost
interest after three years. that‘s
true. However. the real reason is
that I was disenchanted with the
program as it is under Coach
Grant."

“When I was a freshman,”
continued Morris, “our team had
as much potential as any team in
the East. But nothing jelled.
We didn’t progress and the fault
lies with the coaching.”

He explained how he felt the
Penn State team was ‘nothing two
years ago. and how good coach-

to do. Above

O’Gorek, Scott Lead
Panthers Over CW

by MARTY HELLMAN

Clutch shooting by Kent Scott and Paul O'Gorek paced the bas-
ketball team to its first victory of the new year on Wednesday night
against the George Washington Colonials.

After blowing big leads in both halves. the Panthers \held on for
an 82-76 win at the Fort Myer gym in Arlington, Virginia.

Scott, who had his best shoot-
ing performance since the Wis-
consin game early in December,
hit for eleven field goals and a
total of 23 points. Kent found the
Colonial zone defense to his lik-
ing with many long jumpers.

O’Gorek played an extremely
strong game under both the of-
fensive and defensive boards
and also finished with 23 points.
The rugged 6-8 center, who has
played well in the past several
games, scored many crucial bas-
kets each time the Colonials be-
gan to narrow the Panther lead.

Twice in the second half. GW
chopped a sizeable Panther mar-
gin down to within a basket. The
Colonials outscored the hoopsters

12-1 during a stretch,‘ to bring,

 

the score to 51-49. Walt Szczer-
biak, a high school star in Pitts-
burgh, hit for six of his 23 points
then. -

O'Gorek was injured slightly
at the beginning of this turn-

around and his absence gave the
Colonials a height advantage.

Upon his return, the Panthers
quickly upped the lead to nine
points.

Szczerbiak again spearheaded
the second Colonial rally with
10 minutes to go in the game.
Aided by Ronnie Nunn’s long
jumpers, GW pulled to within
two at 64-62.

2. He can’t plan workouts for

Dave Adams remains surprisingly optimistic in the face of the pow-

erful midshipmen of Navy.

Mark Payne. who was barred from the mat because of shoulder

Payne‘s appearence against Navy is doubtful. however. since he has

VINCE DiNARDO

While some other top eastern
teams have already participated
in three or four meets. the Pitt
tracksters will finally open their
season tomorrow as ten runners
enter the Washington C.Y.O.
meet in the nations capital.

Pitt Coach Jim Banner believes
he has some “very talented run-
ners who need big meet compe-
tition." Banner goes as far as
to say that the present squad
is "by far the best squad" he
has had to date. With this in
mind. it is not hard to under-
stand his lack of concern for
going into such a big meet so
early.

“I like it", he said. “It will
give us the opportunity to get a
good start.“ A good start for the
track team could include a possi-
ble fourth place finish. “We
could conceiveably finish fourth“.
he stated.

But more important to Banner
and his squad would be some
good qualifying times for the
IC4A’s and the NCAA meets
rather than a fourth place finish.

Even though the meet will be
the first in the current indoor
season for the tracksters, they
will find themselves competing
with some of the finest track
talent in’ the country. For in-
stance, Jerry Richey, who will
run in the 2-mile. event, will
have to face Marty Liquori,

- (CantiriuedonHPage14) ,

177-pound Willie Saloky was

spectacularly removed from the
Pitt line-up by a brick wield-
ing antagonist. Saloky sustained
a fractured skull and will not
compete for the remainder of
the season.

Saloky will be missed by Ad-
ams. The wrestler was undefeat-
ed after two matches.

"I think he was really coming
along and I was very pleased
with him. Without him ‘in the
line-up we won't be able to
move men around as much.“

All-American heavy weight
Ralph Cindrich is still absent
due to the knee injury he suffer-
ed in football. His return was=an-
ticipated but so far has not mat-
erialized.

Steve Weiss was injured in
practice and will leavethe 118
spot to freshman Lud Hanzcer.
Hanzcer, a walk on, had an un-
distinguished highschool career.

Despite the injuries Adams
feels that his team is better pre-
pared for Navy now than they
were last season.

“We have an opportunity to
beat them but it‘s going to take a
fine effort. We're ready for it
mentally. Injuries are a part of
the game. We just have to ac-
cept it and go out to win. If we
had Cindrich back and Weiss we
would stand a real good chance."

The coach feels that a large
turn out of fans will be greatly
beneficial to the team’s effort.

"I‘ll be disappointed with a
crowd of less than four thou-
sand." he stated.

Navy has a host of formidable
grapplers in all of the weight
classes.

“We're going to have trouble
with all of them,” stated Adams.

The midshipmen were not rank-

'ed in pre-season polls and are not

 

squad. “We don't need a coach
behind us to breed competitive
spirit. What we need is a good
swimmer next to us making us
work harder."

Mark Cohen
only one of eleven swimmers is
a freshman Simon Solomon.

Grant disagrees. “I did the
best that could be done. We
didn’t have any money to offer
recruits, but I did the best I
could to bring in new swimmers.
This year we added two divers
to the squad, a backstroker, free-
stylers, and two boys from out
of state. There were eleven new
swimmers added to the team.”

Rick Rowe stated that the team
asked Grant if they might invite
recruits to Pitt for a week—end
to show them the campus, and
Grant refused.

“The boys did ask me to bring
recruits to Pitt." remarked Grant.

‘Tourney Team, again excited the crowd at the Civic Arena ‘on the tourn'ey’s second night, (the l3, 534

Competition

With most of the squad re-
turning from last year the swim-
mers open their 1970-71 season
against Bucknell ‘University to-
morrow at 2 pm. at Trees pool.

Jim Howell and Dave Ander-
son will be swimming to fill the
gap left by the loss of top breast-
stroker. Al Morris, who has quit
the team. Mark. Cohen, Rick
Rowe tfreestylersl. Jim Hughes
(backstroke) and Dave Wessel
(driving) are back trying to re-
venge last seasons 48-65 loss
to Bucknell.

I Bucknell defeated Colgate 73-
40 and tied West Virginia in the

' gr Penn State Relays earlier this
, season. Brad Tufts. assistant dir-
* ector of athletic information at

Bucknell. stated. "Were not
what you call a powerhouse but

A were as strong as we were last

yearf’

Peter 0’Keeffe, 100-200 free-
‘styler, leads the squad whose
depth lies in freestyle.

Pitt‘s Coach Bill Grant com-

7’ mented. "This is the competition

we've waited for so long.

We can handle them in diving.
All we need is our second place
swimmers to come through."

Pitt swimmer Tom Hayes re-
marked. “The meet will be eith-
er close or they‘ll kill us."

Hockey Club

lTo Be Formed

Pitt student Joe Testa has had
some success in finding people
interested in organizing an ice
hockey team club at Pitt.

The group that has begun to
form is holding an organization-
al meeting next Wednesday (Jan-
uary 13) for all faculty mem-
bers, undergraduates, ‘and grad-
uate students who are interested
injoining.

The meeting will be held in
Room 128 at Trees Hall, begin-
ning at 3:30 p.m. Dr. Michael
Sherman of the Health-Education
Department is aiding the hockey
enthusiasts.

"to show them the campus and
swimming facilities. When the
recruits arrived and I contacted
the swimmers no one was avail-
able."

Swimmers are also dissatisfied
with practices. “We need work
on starts and turns,” stated Co-
hen. “Every time we have a meet
they are just the things we have
trouble with. When do we prac-
tice them? After the meet is
over. We need quality work be-
fore our meet, notiafterwards.”

Rowe added. “We haven’t seen
any of our suggestions at work-
outs at all. We think we know
where our weaknesses are and
what we need to practice. We
also believe that different types
of swimmers should be practicing
differently."

Grant stated. “We have been
working out the way they have
wanted to. I work them for en-
durance in a meet. Practices
have been going well.“

In regard to Grant’s inability
to correct *~strokes, Cohen re-
marked, “Mr Grant rarely tells
us what to do and never how
and why to do it.” Cohen also be-
lieves that the swimmers haven’t
improved since high school. “I

Fiji

 

have a dream, andmit’s making
the nationals. But with the pre-
sent coaching I'll never do it.”

Line-ups according to the team
aren’t made up until ten min-
utes before the meet. "You have
to psyche yourself up for a meet,"
stated Rowe. “It would help to
know whether you are swimming
‘500’ or a ‘1000.‘ And we may
have some suggestions on how we
feel physically, or we may know
something about an opponent
which could help with the line-
up.” Cohen added that the team
has asked for a tentative line-up
by Thursday, but claimed" that
they never get th:.n.

"The situation has been re-
medied." Grant replied. Line-
ups will be ready by Thursday
he indicated.

The final accusation regarded
Grant’s lack of- rapport with the
swimmers. “Mr. Grant won't
defend us at meets,” maintains
Cohen. “When we have »a bad
call he never protests. It’s almost
like swimming against him. We
have never seen Mr. Grant cheer
for us.”

" Cohen concluded. “You swim
for three reasons: yourself. your
coach and your team. And with
the coach we ca-n only sw_im for
ourselves and our team."
