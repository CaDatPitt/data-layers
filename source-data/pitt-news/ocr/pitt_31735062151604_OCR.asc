team that made. sound the "adage that
had been attached to it throughout
the season—“the team that _wins when
it wants to win.” The Panthers have
done exactly that this year.
Doing the unusual in the beginning,
'the='Panthers passed their way into

rate long shots. - -By the time inter-

tied the score- at 19-19, kep't it tied
until 24-24. Then"the Pant'h'ers‘" de-
cided that something had' to "be done".
And they did it. " - I '
Field goals ‘by Zelez-nik, Jesko,‘ and
Fabel, aided by a successful Johnson
free throw gave the Panthers 3. 31-24
advantage which was _more than
enough ‘to enable them to stride into"
the game’s end on the right side.
Bob Johnson, Pitt’s smooth guard,
was the ﬁre in the Pitt attack. He
netted four goals"and".six fouls for a
high point total of 14. - Mike Bloom,
Temple center and second highest

‘scorer in the. conference, was second

in point-making again with 10 points.

 Speaking at the third--;_iAn the series
ofAvASFA’s- Concert Hour? and Book
Chat assemblies, Theodore M. Finney,
lecturer in musical apprgeciation and
d-i-rec_Atori of the Men—’sa‘_“ lee club, com-
mented on the develo"p"ziients in mu-
sical history brou'ght= about by great
revolutionary composers, past and
present. " C‘ : ‘if
. A I_nA"tl1e- Aﬁr_st. section ofihis remarks

 

 

‘ the speaker. pointed out-: how Monte-

verdeand" Gl1"i"ck_A,;"'tWo of the early
‘fgA1'ea~ts_,A” had succeeded in mapping
out; the main. outlines of opera which

‘later c"oAmpo,se’rsA‘ have", depended upon

so much. Gluck»-in“ p""a_rticular set out

- to free the musicdrarna from the lu-

dic1'ousA‘state it had fallen in with

virtuostic acrobats who had dominated
it for so long." ‘ * --

.~ “Mozart was the type of man who
possessed" so much- genius that he
could do almost anything he wanted
in music,” commented Mr. Finney, in
A._'egaA1A‘dAto the little Austrian’s music.
"But he was nevertheless a product
if the formal age‘ into which he was
born, and he was forced to write, to
a large degree, in a style that pan-
dered "to the -'ta‘s"tes-"-of ‘- his public.
is only when Mozart gave free reign
to his. emo‘t;ions-that we can look into
the d_epths'of_ the man.” «A To back up

A his point, Mr._ Finney-cited movements

from some of the composer’s cham-
ber music that is sublime in its bitter-
ness. - ‘ 

Although unable _"to conclude his.

lecture because of lack of time, Mr.
Finney was ableto touch on some of

the highlights in the career of Rich- -

ard Wagner".- .Borrowing, spending‘

Minerva considered the clipped

slight phrase adequate to express her

Iriterscholastic, Pitt Squad
Swim Contests To Fill

Maybe all roads don’t~lead to Pitts-
burgh for Johnny Q. Public, but they
will for schoolboy natators from high
schools of western Pennsylvania and
eastern Ohio, Saturday, when the
schoolboys will pack their swim suits
and come to Pittsburgh via automo-
bile,‘train, bus, or thumb to partici-
pate in ‘the twenty-third annual Uni-
versity interscliolastic championships
to be held in Trees Gym Pool.

At the same time that the school-
boys ‘are attempting to sink the Pitt
interscholastic marks, the Panther
varsityland freshman mermen will be

"staging their own"com‘pet‘ition'in the ‘

form of the annual Pitt cliampioii
ships. _Botl1,,atfa_irs are scheduled to
start at 1:30 o’clock.

Set Six Records

Last year the schoolboys. did right
Well by themselves, setting six new
l‘ll211’l{S: for the seven interscholastic
events.: This year ‘the schoolboys will
have a1diﬂ’icult"ti'me breaking the "rec-
ords they _set last -year‘, but if" Erie
Strong Vincent enters its 18(5)-_va1’d
relay te'a1'n' again this year the ‘record
they set last‘ year for this event will
probably meet the eventual rough
.treatment of all records. Last week
they set a new~-mark for-tl1e‘1~80
yard event_at,-the Tech interscliolasti-cs
and ‘two weeks ago they set a new

reco1'd_for the same event at -the‘ Penn _

State interscholastic meet.

Little record-shattering noise is ex-
pected in the interscholastics, bu't four
out of the six University champion-
ship records are expected to be bet-
'_‘te1'ed. -The , entrance of Milt Leder-

Legs llfean. Nothing

To Diver lVIcQu.illan

By Tom Locke

Star Distance Swimmer

If Red McQ;uilla11, captain and
diving  of the Pitt swim-
ming team, could arrange to
have one of his legs broken, he-
would be a cinch to win the na-
tional (living championship. At
any rate, in the two greatest ex-
hibitions of his c.a1'ee.r, in both‘
of '\vhicl1‘ he won an Eastern Collegi-
ate Championship, he has been handi-
cupped or aided by leg injuries."

In his sophomore year, McQuillan
won the climnpionship, incidentally,
the. first E:-Lste1'11 Collegiate title ever
to be won by a Pitt s\vim1ner, in spite
of the fact that in the afternoon
trials he had slipped on ‘the board and
badly dislocated his .ankle, forcing
him to. dive. in the. evening with his
foot and ankle, half covered with
banda._:-res. l’at Corr, swimming coach,
spent. the evening with his face turned
away for luck, because he expected‘
to see the ankle crumble any minute.

It didn"t, however, and Red walked, -

really limped, away with the title.

chances of 'victory, lV_IcQ_uillan devel-

Laboratory Study

The Commons Room, which will be
dedicated in June, as a part of the
sesquicentennial ceremonies, contains
15,000 square feet of Vermont slate,
the finest in the world. Thirty-ﬁve
freight cars were used in transporting
the slate to Pittsburgh.

In addition to the ﬂoor, slate is also
being used in the first ﬂoor elevator
lobbies, in the co1‘rido1‘s of the
ground ﬁoor, and in the halls of the
first, second, and third ﬂoors which——
in balcony fashion-—surround the
Commons Room. '

The contractor who is installing
the floors, Alfred M. Danzilli, was
-graduated from the University with
the degree of bachelor of science in
civil engineering in 1913, and re-
ceived his degree in civil engineering
in 1916.

By Richard Cooper

“Vibrato is not often known by
those who possess it,” was the state-
ment made by Lee M. Lockhart, direc-
tor of the University band and or-
chestra, in a talk before the Psychol-
ogy Forum on Monday. Speaking on
“Studies in the Vibrato,” Mr. Lock-
-hart pointed out that former sub-
jective theories on this subject are
gradually giving way to C0llCll1Sl0f1:
based" on laboratory analysis.

Hitherto, vibrato has been consid-
ered a matter of varying the pitch or
the intensity of a tone. As a matter
of fact, it is a regular oscillation in-
volving pitch, intensity and timbre,
the three accepted qualities of tone.

‘Intuition’ No Help

Tests made to check the validity of
subjective methods on which older
tlieories were based have demon-
strated that “intuition” is not much
help in the study of vibrato. Al-
though vibrato is present in ninety-
five ‘per cent of all vocal music, even
accomplished artists fail to identify
it, often passing off such characteris-
ties as “qualities or the voice.”

Explaining the ‘vibrato, Mr. Lock-
hart said that the ave1'age ‘number of
vibrations for trained singers is about
seven per cecond._Vo.1-iatio_n in pitch
amounts to one-half tone. Because of
-.‘-sensory fusion in the ear, the auditor
hcars a ‘tone midway between the
two cxtro'rnes.__W11en the rate of vibra-
tion is reduced to four oscillations er
second, the two esti-cine pitches e-
come distinct, and the effect is that
of a u-i_11 rather than a true vibrato.

The oﬁcct of ernotioii on tonal ‘vari-
ation in the vibrato is particularly
noticeable in operatic singers. Per-
forming at a concert, such artists
show no difference in vibrato from
other singers. on the operatic stage,
however, they sing with a Inuch more
pronounced vibrato. This cliange is

Student Delegates

Women, will represent the Pitt.:;bv11‘g‘h
district at the Intercollegiate Confer-
ence on Governnient in Ha1'1'isburg,
April 8 to 10 inclus-i'Ve. _

The con_fere'nce, whicli was founded
here at the Uiiiversity, p1*oposes to
present a better uiidelstanding of the
limitations of the State Constitution
to students who are preparing for
;_:areers in law and gover'nment.

Miss Genevieve Blatt, conference
director and graduate assistant in
political science at the U1‘1i'-.re.1'sity
says,

“Students attending the conference
from any of the 30 Pennsylvania col-
leges and 1miv‘ersi'ties may introduce
resolutions calling for amendments to
the state constitution; but no bills
clearly conflicting will be introduced.”

based on need alone, or should not be
associated with relief, but that grants
should be given only to students with
mental ability who are, to a certain
extent, in need of funds. He added
that more students need help than
the seven pericent that already are
provided for by the NYA, a(l'-«'ocating'
extension to about 255 per cent of
the student population.

The next speaker, Mr. Young added
a few more points of criticism, saying
tllat the public works provisions: of
the act should be tied up and coordi-
nated with other public works under
the national administration. He also
raised the question to specifically
where the money shall be obtained

The student spcalccr, Sta‘J'l<., came
to the defense of the legislatioti. I-l.-e
said that the NYA does not provide
sufficient funds, advocated extcnsioii
of NYA payments to meet union Wage
scales, and declared against the mili-
tarization of CCC camps, which Mc-
Gowan hadadvised earlier. I-Ie de-
clared that 500 million was only a

Mr. Carter verifies the wisdom of this pref-

radio, stage, screen and opera. Their voices are
their fortunes. That’s Why so many of them
smoke Luckies. You, too, can have the throat pro-
