‘That’s no longer the ease’

Students attend Pitt for advertised degree program, now told it’s not ready

Liz Navratil
and Vaughn Wallace

Students are threatening to leave
Pitt after administrators in the
School of Education told some un-
derclassmen this week that they
won’t be able to participate in the
ﬁve—year program they’ve been
preparing for because the Univer-
sity hasn’t yet approved it.

Some freshmen and sopho-
mores received an e—mail Wednes-
day from Alan Lesgold, dean of the

School of Education, saying that
they won’t be able to‘ participate
in the ADP—Plus program, which
would have allowed them to earn

a bachelor of science, master of '

education and teaching certiﬁcates
in early childhood education and
special education in ﬁve years.
Lesgold told students, “When
the ‘program was advertised, we
thought it would be approved in
time for current freshmen and
sophomores to enter it. Unfortu-
nately, that’s no longer the case. We
have been asked to make revisions

before it can be approved, and al-
though we are currently working
on those, we don’t have a deﬁnite
date for when we will receive pro-
gram approval.” _
Sophomore Danielle Brooks
decided during her senior year of
high school to come to Pitt because
she liked the ADP-Plus program.
She said she is “deﬁnitely trans-
ferring” now, hopefully to Edin-
boro or Slippery Rock universi-
ties. A
“I will withdraw by Tuesday,”
she said. “I’ve already talked to an

adviser in Arts and Sciences about
it. I’mino longer anywhere near
an A8zS sophomore [in terms of
requirements] .”

Sophomore Carol Dai said she
transferred to Pitt last spring after
she saw_ an advertisement for the
ADP-Plus program. It seemed like
an “amazing program you can’t get
anywhere else,” she said.

Dai plans to stay at Pitt because,
“It’s my third semester  I’m set-
tled. I’ve got great friends.”

She said she hopes to apply to
the University’s applied develop-

Tuition on the Rocks, held at Union Grill on South Craig Street, petitioned for federal bailout money to

Drinkers collect for G—20 court costs

Tonyjovenitti
For The Pitt News

Three months after the G-20
Summit brought protesters and
riot police to Pittsburgh, some
of the people who were arrested
want to raise money to help cover
their court costs.

Pitt student Keith DeVries and

CMU student Casey Brander are
organizing an event to raise mon-
ey for the G-20 Legal Defense
Fund, which supports people ar-
rested during September’s Sum-
mit. They called the event “Drink
forjustice —— WWMLKD?”

The Facebook event listing
says the proceeds will go toward
“those of us still in the ﬁght.”

Students asked for money while sip-
ping on free drinks last night. i
Three advocacy groups — Cam-
pus Progress, the United States Stu-
dent Association and the U.S. Public
Interest Research Group — hosted an

event called “Tuition onthe Rocks” at -

the Union Grill on South Craig Street.
They asked students to press Pennsyl-
vania’s senators Bob Casey and Arlen
Specter to support the Student Aid
and Fiscal Responsibility Act.
About 40 people came to sign a
petition to have the act passed. After
signing the petition, each attendee

got a ticket for a free drink. A group V

p sue a master’s in education and, if possible,

special education certiﬁcation.

“I feel like it’s very irresponsible of the
administration and unacceptable to treat
students in this manner,” she said. “Retro-
actively, they’re trying to do the best they
can. I wish there was more communication
 This situation shouldn’t have happened
in the ﬁrst place.”

Lesgold said in a separate interview that
the School of Education chose to advertise
the program before it was approved because,
“Everybody thought it was going to be ap-
proved more quickly, and it just didn’t hap-

rnust fmd new paths

ﬁcially enter it until their junior year. Two
or three students expressed interest in the
program on their college applications, but
about 60 students are taking the classes that

students tend to take onlywhen they’re-pre- V

paring for the ADP—Plus program, he said.

Some of the classes won’t help the stu- '

dents progress towards any other degree.
To compile his list of students to e_-mail,
Lesgold worked ﬁrst with one student pre-
paring for ADP—Plus to devise a list of other
students preparing for the program. Another
round of e—mails went to students who were
taking classes typical of ADP—Plus candi-
dates. _ ' ’ .

pen. We did check in advance, and I think
everybody acted in good faith at every level
of the University.” ’

The program, Lesgold said, is awaiting
ﬁnal approval from the Provost’s Oﬂice. He
said he’s “not entirely sure” what revisions
need to be made to the program, but thinks
they relate to the general education require-
ments. _,

Contributing to the delay, he said, is the
fact that the state is changing its teacher
certiﬁcation requirements. _ .

New regulations will require Pennsylvania
teachers who graduate from college in 2013
or later to have a dual certiﬁcation in special
-education if they want to teach students in
kindergarten through eighth grade.

Lesgold said he’s received some fallout

' from angry students and parents.

g “It doesn’t surprise me at all that they’re
concerned,” he said. “I would be concerned
too if I heard that the path I’m on isn’t going
to work.” ‘ ' — V .
.He said’ his ofﬁce’s goal now_ is to help
students ﬁnd alternatives.
“I think we’re doing that reasonably well,”
he said.
Lesgold said he wasn’t sure how many
freshmen and sophomores were preparing
for the program, because students don’t of~.

_ Lesgold’s e—mai_1 tells freshmen to contact
Elementary Education Program Coordinator
Meryl Lazar at mklazar@pitt.edu, because
the School of Education is “not able to offer
any options” for them yet.

Lesgold offered sophomores two options,

I guaranteeing students who graduate with at

least a 3.0 GPA acceptance into both.
Under the ﬁrst option, students would
earn a bachelor’s degree through the School
of Arts and Sciences and apply to Pitt’s El-
ementary Education program during their
senior year. They would then complete either
a four-term master’s program or a two—term
teacher certiﬁcation program. Students who

. want to pursue this option should contact

their adviser in the School of Arts and Sci-
ences. _ ,

Under the second option, students can
apply for admission into Pitt’s Applied De-

»velopmental Psychology program-and» if~ac-

cepted earn a bachelor’s degree in applied
developmental psychology. These students
would then complete either a four-term
master’s program or a two—term teacher
certiﬁcation program. i .

Lesgold suggested that students interest-
ed in either option meet with an enrollment
coordinator at the Admissions and Enroll.-
ment Services in the School of Education.

and are expensive, it says. It’s been almost
90 days since the first group of G-20 tri-
als, and the next major round of hearings
begins Wednesday.

So Sunday from 8 p.m. to 2 a.m. at
the Rock Room in Polish Hill, people
can “drink for justice” — with a $5 cover
charge, live D15 and free food.

DeVries is facing misdemeanor charges
for failure to disperse and disorderly con-
duct. He said that while some lawyers in
the city were offering cheap representa-

laying their trials for 90 days, until they
can prove they’ve done their service and
have their charges dropped.

DeVries chose not to take the commu-
nity service. His charges were waived for
a later court date.

He said he’s luckier than most.

“A lot of kids are coming from out of
town,” he said. “This whole process is very
expensive for them.”

Brander was also arrested during the
G-20. Her charges were withdrawn, but
she’s still waiting for her record to be ex-
punged.

She said that because the court pro-
ceedings “drag on forever,” many people
need help from the G—2O Legal Defense
Fund.

“I was lucky,” she said. “But it is still
so important, it doesn’t just go away. For
several weeks of my life, I couldn’t think
about anything else.”

“Drink forjustice” is a way for everyone
to get together, have a little fun before
they continue the ﬁght and raise money,
Brander said.

“We are just trying to engage students
and talk to them about what happened,”
DeVries said. “So nobody forgets.”

DeVries said he’s seen other events
similar to “Drinking for Justice.” These
events, he said, are less about drinking and
more about bringing people together.

“People rally around drinking for all
types of reasons, many of them pretty silly
in the grand scheme of things,” he said.
“This is a chance to rally around some-
thing for a cause — for a change.”

DeVries said the event’s purpose is not
to change the perceptions of the com-
munity.

“People in the outsidewcommunity al-
ready have their preconceptions about stu-
dents and especially about students who’
were arrested during the G—20,” he said.
“And really, there’s no changing that.”

More H1N1 vaccines

Liz Navratil
News Editor

Students can now receive the H1N1 vaccine
in Student Health Services.

The University announced in an e—mail
that Student Health Services will offer both
the injectable and the nasal spray forms
of the vaccine from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. every
Monday through Friday. Students should
call ahead to schedule an appointment.

The University has enough vaccines to
cover all students who have already regis-

tered for it, according to the e-mail. The
University suggests that people who are
pregnant or have a chronic medical condi-
tion, such as asthma or heart disease, take
the injectable form of the vaccine instead
of the nasal spray.

Students who are allergic to eggs or are
severely ill should not take the vaccine.

Some adults ages 18 to 49 have reported
having headaches or muscle aches after tak-
ing the vaccine. Some who have taken the
injectable form of the vaccine have reported
having soreness or redness around the in-
jection site, according to the e-mail.

Sex toys going green

Dear Ke$ha, look how far you’ve come

 

' Kieran Layton
A8'E Editor

Dear Ke$ha,
First of all, congratulations are

in order. You took down the inter-
national tsunarni of musical success
that is Susan Boyle! It must feel good
to knowthatyour album, Animal, had
the entrance power to debut at No. 1
on the Billboard 200, knocking down
the record—shattering Boyle and her
silly, Muzak-like warbling.

Just be careful, though, because
those Brits are a feisty bunch. Susan
Boyle might challenge you to an actual
sing—olf, or she might suffer another
mini-breakdown—- you decidewhich
is worse.

On a serious note, Ke$ha, your

sprint to fame has been incredible
to observe. Just a few months ago,
you were a measly icon for the club
kids, pumping out underground and

, poorly produced pop tracks for people

to name drop for some quick pop mu-
sic street cred.~ ‘

But now, people are comparing
you to Britney, Katy Perry and even
Lady Gaga — all because you let
people know that when you wake up
in the morning, you feel like P. Diddy!
And that you brush your teeth with
Jack Daniel’s.

On that note, I think all dentists
wouldagreethat singingaboutbrush-
ingyour teeth with whiskey is not the
best way to promote oral hygiene in
your youth—centered fan base. In fact,
many of the things you sing about

aren’t really things that young boys
and girls should be exposed to, at least
until college. -

It’s true, Britney sangabout being
a “slave” to her man, but you refer
to yourselfas a “lovesick crackhead?’

when singing about a crush you have. 7

C6»-

_ Your family played host *
to Paris Hilton and Nicole
Richie.Now everything
makes much more sense.

Katy Perry sang about experiment-
ing with bi-curiosity, but you sing
about throwing up in a closet while
intoxicated ata“Party ataRich Dude’s
House.” Andyouwantto throwtothe
curb any guy who doesn’t look-like
Mickjagger — sweetie, have you seen
Mickjagger recently? '

You can’t deny it, Ke$ha: The life-
style your songs promote does not
come across as the purest — some
might even deem it necessary to take
a shower or four after a few listens.
Thus, I feel it wholly appropriate to
declare that you have created a new
sub -genre of pop music: skank rock.

, Now, don’t take this personally.
You yourself described your style as
“garbage chic,” so Ithinkskankrockis
justamore speciﬁc way of describing

your inﬂuence on the music scene.
Coincidentally, you’ve sung back-

-up for Britney and even appeared in

Perry’s “I Kissed a Gir ” music video,
and their inﬂuence on you is under-
standable. But what made you want
to take it to the next level? Oh yeah,
your family played host to Paris Hil-
ton and Nicole Richie on “The Simple
Life.” Noweverything makes much
more sense.

Skank rock need not be a nega-

‘tive label— it certainly doesn’t mean
T that anyone who enjoys your music

is “a person ... of low or sleazy char-
acter,” as Merriam-Webster deﬁnes
the skank persona. It simply refers to
the notion that we all like to let loose
sometimes, occasionally in a not-so-
classy manner. 5

Denzel ﬂick not
cinematic apocalypse

‘Eli’ offers action, metaphors and viewer satisfaction

Liz Keeney
Staff Writer

“The Book of Eli”

Starring: Denzel Washington, Gary,
Oldman, Mila Kunis .  L
Directors: Albert- Hughes, Alleng

Hughes 
Studio: Warner Bros.

Grade: B+

Over the past few years, moviegoers have
sat through a seemingly endless barrage of

ﬁlms dealing withthe apocalypse. There’s€

been thegood (“The'Road”), the mediocre
(“I Am Legend”) and the Cusack (“2012».”).
Apparently in these trying economic times,
the best way to cheer up is by watching a
movie about the world ending.

The latest addition to. the apocalyptic
genre is “The Book of Eli,” and while“ it
does not reach the pinnacle of apocalypse
ﬁlms, it’s deﬁnitely worth the trip to the
theater. "

Directed by Albert and Allen Hughes,‘

whose previous work includes “Menace
II Society” and “From Hell,” “The Book of
Eli” is done in their typical gritty, violent
style. However — unlike some of their
other ﬁlms — the Hughes brothers don’t
sacriﬁce substance for go re, and they take
an interesting angle on the end—of—days
concept. ' t A ,

Instead of focusing on immediate
survival and recovery .— which is the norm
for most movies in the genre — “The Book
of Eli” deals with rebuilding and developing
society.

Picking up 30 years after “the war
burnt a hole in the sky,” the ﬁlm follows
Eli (Denzel Washington) as he travels

west, all the while telling himself not to
“stray from the path” even when facing
the scenes of degradation around him. He
has in his possession the last copy of the
Bible, something Gary Oldman’s character,
the aptly named Carnegie, desperately

,, wants.

Eli is joined by Solara-(Mila Kunis),
Carnegie’sstepedaughter, and the bulk of
the ﬁlm follows their journey 'on*t_»he run

out. It’s.refreshing;to see-hi'n”1iri.som‘ething
other than “Harry Potter'.”._’or “Batman,”
and he plays the villain well. ’~ '

At ﬁrst the plot seems deceivingly simple.
However, writer Gary Whitta interestingly
uses Eli’s travels as a metaphor for societal
growth. A i

As he makes his way west, Eli also travels
through different levels of society. He ﬁrst

-meets a single man struggling to survive,

then smallraiding bands praying on the

weak followed by emerging communities

with growing cultural customs, such as
trade, education and religion. While many

trailers for the ﬁlm depict “The'pBook of pi
Eli” as an action movie in the vein of “Mad ,
Max,” the former has more substance, and .

Eli plays a role closer to that of prophet
than vigilante.

The action sequences are impressive -
even excessively violent at times —— but it is
the story that will keep viewers interested.
The Hughes brothers use the characters and
scenery to enhance the story, not dominate
it. Instead of letting ﬂashy special effects
run the show, the plot is what really drives
the ﬁlm. A . c

On the whole, “The Book of Eli” is an
all~around good ﬁlm and will satisfy action
fans and ﬁlm critics alike.

Keep mascara running, Ke$ha

» Layton 4 8

The party—minded lifestyle that your music
promotes is not new, but before you, it was left
to the boys to sing about having that uninhib-
ited ﬁm. The Cobra Starships and the T—Pains

gpf the world had it under control before you

came along.

But now; you’re letting the world know that
girls can have fun too and that they should let
their freak ﬂags ﬂy. I would personally suggest
cleaning up any runny mascara the morning
aiteraparty, butbecause that appears to be your

signature make—up design, even that may not
be necessary.

Pop music has always been about embracing
the idea of the guilty pleasure, and with your
music, Ke$ha, you’re merely taking it to the next
level. Hell, the era of celebutante, crotch—ﬂashing
and bad behavior reached it’s peak two years
ago — Britney hasn’t swung an umbrella at a
carinsuch alongtime! Of course, there’s always
Lindsay Lohan  A V

Keep doingyour thing, and in the meantime,

I’m going to try to ﬁnd that “place downtown

most recently, Chile. .

“It’s basically the ﬁrst tifne many of these
people have ever seen stepping,” Williams said
about Step Afrika!’s travels abroad.

“The audiences responded so easily,” he
said, explaining that Step Afrika!’s engagements
around the world use the cultural exchange as
a “means of creating friendship and building
understanding.” ¥ .

Therefore, in every country with which Step
Afrika! shares the art of step, the organization
obtains a piece of foreign culture as well. The
culture is then merged into a portion of Step

' Afrika!’s production to be shared with audiences
everywhere. _

, '‘‘[Step Afrika!’s] ﬁiture looks so bright be-
cause there are so many different cultures to
explore, and so many different people to meet,”
Williams said of this process. “So who knows
what ourperforrnanceswilllook like after more
tours around the world?” .

Other organizations have joined in the effort
to preserve the tradition of step. This includes
Pittsburgh’s own Omicron chapter of Alpha Phi
Alpha.

CalvinMack, ajuniorat Carnegie Mellon and

member of Alpha Phi Alpha, didn’t learn about

the tradition of stepping from his family.
Instead itwas the family he found in his ﬁa-
' temity that taught him the importance of step.
1 “The Alphas have been [stepping] for years,
and they maintain a certain standard when it
’ comestostepping,”Mackexplained-.“[Mybroth-
ers and I] wanted to preserve that standard.”

Both Williams and Mack learned howto step
as brothers of their organization.

“Stepping is an expression of individuality
in a fraternity,” Mack said, emphasizing that
each speciﬁc fraternity has exclusive step dances
signifyingwhy their organizationis meaningful
to them. - '

Mack also believes that although it might not
be as widely recognized as other art forms, the
art of step itself is exclusive.

“Stepping differs from other dance forms
because you have to make your own rhythm,”
he said, comparing step to ballet; in which a
rhythm is given to dance to and the audience
watches the performance and applauds upon
its conclusion.

Crowd engagement is essential to the art of
step throughout the performance.

Step Afrika! plans to hold Pittsburgh's atten-
tion this Sunday,Jan. 17, at Byham Theater. The
step show includes seasoned step artists from
all over the country.

“We can’t wait to share what we’ve learned
from other countries with the city ofPit1sburgh,

Streaking PanthershostLouisvi||e

With its 67-57 conquest over UConn, Pitt has won seven straight before playing the Cardinals

Lauren Kirschman
Staffwri ter

This was supposed to be a rebuild-
ing year. The Pitt men’s basketball
team was supposed to struggle
through its ﬁrst four Big East

games, particularly the three— ..

game road stretch.

Somebody forgot to tell the
Panthers that.

As it is, No. 20 Pitt (14—2, 4-0
Big East) and No. 4 Villanova are
the only remaining undefeated
teams in Big East conference play,
and the Panthers have won three
straight games on the road, in-
cluding victories against top-10
Syracuse and top—25 Connecti-
cut.

‘ “We just battled,” Pitt head
coachjamie Dixon said following
the Connecticut game.

While that statement has be-
come a recurring theme for this
year’s Panthers, the squad learned
the quality from its predeces-
sors. [

Despite the disappearance -of
familiar faces from last year’s
Elite Eight team, the new Panthers

seemed to have grasped an impor- ‘

tant lesson about Pitt basketball’s

focus: strength and defense.

“Last year, we were more of an

offensive team,?’ seniorjermaine

Dixon said; “Sam [Young] could
score anytime, Dejuan [Blair]
dominated the paint and Levance
[Fields] got the ball wherever he
wanted it. This year, we knew de-
fensively we had to pick it up in or-

der to compete in the Big East.” “

Pitt returns home Saturday at
noon to take on Louisville (12-5,
3-1 Big East), the team that handed
the Panthers their ﬁrst loss last
season and a team that has adapt-
ed to playing without key stand-
outs from last year.

Louisville, however, has

‘struggled in the absence of three

starters from last season’s team,
which won the Big East regular
season and tournament titles and
advanced to the Elite Eight.

In fact, Pitt and Louisville took
nearly opposite paths this season.
‘The Panthers have overachieved,
but the Cardinals have underper-
formed. '

The Panthers began the year
unranked before entering the
rankings the week of Jan. 4 after
their upset of Syracuse. This week,

Hopefully for them, the Pitt women’s
basketball team has a relatively quick
learning curve.

As the Panthers (11-5, 0-3 BigEast)
prepare totakeon No. 18 Westvirginia

A to avenge a 63-59 loss that will have

occurred just 12 days earlier: Tipoff is
scheduled" for 4 p.m. at the Petersen
Events Center.

In the two teams’ previous meet-
ing, the contest remained close until
the end. The Panthers pulled within

just 15.7 seconds remaining, but West '

Virginia’s clutch free throw shooting
secured its victory. ‘
With 6.3 points remaining in the

' game, WestVirginia’s Liz Repella sank

twoﬁeethrowsto give the Mountain-
eers a four-point lead and the win.

 A bright spot for the Panthers in
that game came ﬁ'om the superb play
of redshirt junior Jania Sims, who
contributed a career-high 28 points
inthe loss.

V Butevensims realizesthattheteam

needs to work on closing out games.
The Panthers held a three-point lead
at halﬁime but couldn’t.protect it in
the secondhalf. ,
“1VIost ourgames havebeen close

losses or close wins,” Sims said. “We
haveto play hard until the en ” s ’

Of Pitt’s ﬁve losses this year, four
have been by nine points or fewer. _

The Panthers’ defeat in West Vir-
ginia showed that the two teams fol-
low different paths this season. The
Mountaineers are having their best
startinschool history and ridinga14-
game winning streak. ‘ H _

But the Panthers have not won
since their Dec. 31 victory against
Mount St. Mary’s. '

For Pitt coach Agnus Berenato, the
short time between the meetings of
these twoteamsmightprove to be ben-
eﬁcial. She said that West Virginia is
still“freshinthe minds” ofherplayers.

Also, withaweek offpriorto the game,
Berenato said there would be “plenty
of time to regroup and prepare.”

The Panthers will mainly look to
improve defense and ball control In
the ﬁrst game between the Panthers
and Mountaineers, the Panthers com-
mitted 15 turnovers, off which the
Mountaineers scored 15 points.

In addition, the defensive break-

‘down of the Panthers became evident

in the second halfof the game.

E75-

aﬂoat with
Dixon

Randy Lieberman
Senior Staff Writer

Think back to exactly two months
and two days ago: Pitt’s opener
against the Wofford Terriers at
the Petersen Events Center.

Amid deﬂated fan expecta-
tions following a mass exodus of
talent and with the glaring re?
minder of an Elite Eight banner
hanging above them, the Panthers
stumbled to a 31-24 halftime deﬁ-
cit.

Pitt eventually escaped with
a 63-60 win.

“We’re a new team,” senior
Brad Wanamaker said after the
game. The Panthers returned
zero starters from last season in

- the opener.

Now, Wanamaker could ut-

ter that same quote hardly o"u"E l

of context after’Pitt’s 67-57 vic-
tory over Connecticut Wednes-
day night. Pitt’s slingshot from
an opening-night scare to an
undefeated Big East record owes
signiﬁcant credit to the returns of
seniorjermaine Dixon and junior
Gilbert Brown.

But for my money, I say coach
Jamie Dixon saved this season.
The lack of experience on the
team is staggering, yet the Pag;
thers never panicked —— and they
won’t. _

_]ami'e Dixon wins the coach
of the half-year award, unani-
mously, for what he’s done at Pitt.
Give credit to Texas’ Rick Barnes
and Syracuse’sjim Boeheim, bﬂ‘t
neither havesworked miracles
quitelike Dixon has. Should Pitt
qualify and even have success in
the NCAA Tournament, Dixon de-
serves signiﬁcant consideration
for the coach of the year award,”

- Besides, ho-hum, winning the
gold medal at the U-19 games in
New Zealand, Dixon’s vigilance
over his team’s play all season
has propelled Pitt (14—2, 4-0) to
an undefeated Big East record
so far. *4

The Panthers have also done
it the hard way, winning three

Puzzles by Pappocom  Vveeke

Lieberman 4 11

consecutive road games in some of the

toughest arenas in the conference: Syra-

cuse, Cincinnati and Connecticut.
Rebuilding? Who says this year’s Pitt

7 squad is rebuilding?

Not bad for a team picked to ﬁnish ninth
by opposing coaches in the Big East in a
preseason poll. -

On to quick hits.

Speaking of Cincinnati, all of a sudden
one of the Big East favorites finds itself 2-3
in Big East play, with wins over Connecticut
and Rutgers. The seven-point loss to Seton
Hall andtwo-point loss to St.John’s could
really come_back to haunt the Bearcats
come tournament and resumé-assembling
time. The team has talent, but this year
might be another rebuilding one for the
Bearcats if they can’t find a way to pull
upsets down the stretch.

For the record, the BigEast will have
nine teams in the NCAA Tournament this
year. This league is too deep to settle on
seven or eight by year’s end.

But no Big East team is going to the
Final Four. The conference’s powers just
don’t seem to match Texas or Kansas in
terms of veteran leadership or Kentucky
in terms of talent level.

- Teams tend to forget how tough it is
playing South Florida on the road. ‘Notre
Dame for example probably felt like it was
on spring break onjan. 5, taking a plane
from snowy Indiana to sunny Tampa.
Subsequently, the Irish almost laid an egg
against the Bulls, winning 74-73. West Vir-
ginia also began its game against South
Florida ﬂat, clinging to a two-point half-
time lead before winning 69-50.

Syracuse won its 10th-straight game
against Rutgers on Wednesday night.

Connecticut is going to kick itself after

missing opportunities to close out or take
control of games against Georgetown and
Pitt, respectively. The Huskies blew a 19-
point lead against the Hoyas last Saturday
to lose 72-69, sometimes abandoning an
inside game on offenseiin favor of jump
shots. Then the Huskies followed that up
with ahome loss to Pitt 67-57. In a game
that had many twists, the Huskies never
seemed to ﬁnd forward Stanley Robinson
when they should’ve, again, relying on
jump shots to take a lead. 1

Awards:

Big East Player of the Week:

Notre Dame forward Luke ‘Harangody
continues to post huge numbers. Haran-
gody led the Irish to a pair of close vic-
tories during the week, one a 74-73 ‘win
over South Florida and the other a 70-68
win against West Virginia. Against South
Florida, he scored ‘a season~high 36 points
including the game-winning free throw
with 1.9 seconds remaining. He scored 24
points and grabbed five rebounds against
the Mountaineers.

Big East Team of the Week:
The obvious pick is‘ Pitt, but not just

because of its defensive turnaround dur— '

ing the games. So far this year, when Pitt
shoots above 40 percent, its 12-O.

Big East Matchups to Watch For:

Saturday features the conference
matchup of the year when No. 5 Syracuse
travels to No. 9 West Virginia. Plenty of
athletic guards and forwards to go around
in this game. It should be exciting. Also,
amidst watching some NFL Playoff games,
tune in to watch No. 11 Georgetown take
on No. 4 Villanova on Sunday.

Samuels and Sosa lead
Louisville offense

Louisville 4 11

Pitt jumped to No. 16 in the AP Poll and No.
20 in the ESPN/USA Today Poll.
Jermaine Dixon said that although Pitt

received recent media praise, the Panthers C

remain the same team that onlookers doubt-
ed at the beginning of the year. The team

has kept its mindset as underdogs, Dixon

said, despite its climb into the polls.

Louisville dropped out of the polls the
week of Dec. 7 after climbing as high as No.
16. The Cardinals were upset three times
in four games earlier this season, falling
to UNLV on the road and Charlotte and
Western Carolina at home.

Louisville dropped from the ranks of
the conference unbeaten when it fell to
Villanova 92-84 Jan. 11. _

Not only have the teams taken reverse
paths in the polls, but the Panthers and
Cardinals ﬁnd themselves at opposite ends
of Big East statistics, offensively and de-
fensively.

While Pitt locks down opponents with
their defense, allowing a Big East low of
58 points per game, Louisville is 12th in
the conference, giving up 68.5 points per
game. ‘ '

However, the Cardinalsscore 81.1 points
per game, putting them sixth in the con-
ference. The Panthers are second to last,
putting up 67.8-points per game. Defense
prevailed for the Panthers in the Big East
so far this season, including their last game
when they limited fast—paced, transition-
oriented Connecticut to 57 points.

Against Connecticut, Pitt was once again
led by leading scorers Ashton Gibbs and
Brad Wanamaker. The pair combined for

38 of the Panthers’ 67 points.

Gary McGhee proved important on the
inside, scoring eight points and pulling
down nine rebounds as he dominated the
glass against the Huskies’ frontcourt.

McGhee and the rest of the Panther
squad must continue their solid rebound-
ing against Louisville, asjamie Dixon com-
mented on the Cardinals’ exceptional re-
bounding abilities.

“Their numbers are very good and that’s
what we focused on with our guys,” Dixon
said. “They are rebounding at a high level,
[and have] high numbers, especially in con-
ference play. That’s our emphasis.”

Louisville leads the conference in re-

- bounding margin, grabbing 11.2 more

boards per game than its opponents. They

also grab a league leading 43.0 rebounds '

per game. Sophomore Samardo Samuels,
at 6 foot 9, leads the Cardinals inreboundl
ing, with 7.9 per game. He’s also the team’s
leading scorer with 15.8 points per game,
followed by guard Edgar Sosa, who adds
13.9 points a game.

Beyond rebounding, one of the most
well-known features of a Louisville basket-
ball team is its full court press," with which
the Panthers struggled in the past.

The Cardinals sped the Panthers up us-
ing the press in last season’s loss,_]ermaine
Dixon said, and this year Pitt wants to space
the ﬂoor and get the ball to Gibbs.

“When you press, you’re going to cause
some turnovers, but you have to limit them,”
Jamie Dixon said. “At the other end, you
have to score, attack and take advantage
of the press, too.”
