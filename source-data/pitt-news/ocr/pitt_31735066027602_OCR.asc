Escorts are coming

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

After months of planning
and organizing, it appears a
student—run escort service
that will add to the already
implemented van-call» system
is ready to go.

Student Government Board
member Patrick Huey, who
has been a key proponent of
the service since its concep-
tion, said the starting date is
sometime in January.

‘‘It’s a“ pilot project that
will be run out of the
Department of Parking and
Transporta—tion,” Huey said.

The service is modeled
after a similar service at

"Florida State University.

Huey said the campus in

_ Tallahassee is similar to the

layqct in Oakland.

Pitt’s escort service will
include teams of two Pitt stu-
dents _who are on call through
the dispatcher at parking and
transportation.

Primarily, they will walk
students from the residence
halls on the lower end of

campus to academic build-
ings and vice versa, accord-

ing to Huey. _
The service will not
include any trips to

Sutherland Hall, at least not
in the early stages of the pro-
ject.

Huey said that’s mostly
because van-call already pro-
vides adequate service to the
area up on the Hill.

“We’re coming up with a
different list of what this ser-
vice will cover and what van-
call will cover,” Huey said.
“Van—call is a safer alterna-
tive to walking.”

However, Huey also said
there is safety in numbers,
and that’s one of the reasons
the escort service was origi-
nated.

“The study areas on cam-
pus are our main concern,”
he said.

One of the next steps for
Huey and SGB will be to get
a director for the program. It
will be a paid position, as
will the escorts.

All ‘escorts will go through
a training program, run by
the Pitt Police Department.

College life challenges
new students in ways rang-
ing from memorizing a new
zip code to adjusting to an
academic workload much
more difficult than that of a
high school’s. _It’.s also a
time to become independent
— a chance to discover who
you are and to let everyone
else see that discovery.

For incoming freshmen,
blank walls in dorm rooms
have provided the perfect
canvas. Decorating a room
is a chance to express feel-
ings and tastes, and while
not everyone may see the
room, being surrounded by
familiar things is a simple

way to feel good.

“It’s better to study in [a
decorated] room,” said
Jennifer Burgur from the
Towers.

Many, like Sara Lemmond
and Jill Rosen of Tower B,
enjoy being reminded of
home -- of familiar faces
and names. Others like to
have their favorite models
or actors posing for them on
the walls.

Whether it.’s to make a
statement or simply for fun,
most freshmen have done
something to their rooms
besides rearrange the furni-
ture.

“When you decorate your
room nicely, you like to be
there more,” said Burgur.

Social Securify will be there for you, speakers say

By Jim Rowe
For The Pitt News

Contrary to the opinions of “Generation
X,” the current system of social security
benefits will not run out of money by the
time they are eligible to receive them.

This was the message of a panel of social
security experts last night as they spoke at a
forum in Benedum Hall, co-sponsored by
the Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs and the National
Academy of Social Insurance.

Theodore Marmor, a panelist and profes-
sor of Public Policy and Management from

Yale University. called the issue “one of the
most divisive debates since the 19605.”

“If you really think that the Social
Security trust fund will not be there in the
foreseeable future, I really think that you
have a mental condition,” he said.

Marmor based the ideas of his opposi-
tion’s platform on a concept that he called
“future dread,” the idea that people who are
unhappy with a current situation will pull a
projected ﬁgure fromthe future and apply it
to a current situation.

Panelist Hans Riemer, a recent graduate
of the University of California, and member
of Generation X, is also confident that the

system will still be in place when his gener-
ation will need its beneﬁts.
“The social security system will be there

for you if you want it to be,” he told his fel-

low generation members in the audience. “It
is not like a broken ATM spitting out cash."
Riemer sees the debate growing more and
more furious every year, but can’t under-
stand why his generation isn’t supportive.
“What confuses me is the idea that with-
out social security we won’t have to support
[the older generation],” he said.
We will have to support them, one way or
another, he said, citing that “generationalism

Serbs begin "

Y
ﬁg World Events

SARAJEVO — As the long-
sought cease-fire was delayed
another day, ethnic Serbs began
a huge “ethnic cleansing” cam-
paign, ridding the Banja Luka
of thousands of women and
children while leading thou-
sands of men to unknown loca-
tions.

The Bosnian government said
it delayed the cease-fire
because gas and electricity had
not been fully restored to
Sarajevo.

In the past week, what was
supposed to be the journey to
peace, 10,000 Muslims and
Croats were reported to have
been driven from _their homes.
Men of ﬁghting age were sepa-
rated and detained, while it is
believed many were also killed.

U.N. officials said they fear
that the estimated 20,000 non-.
Serbs who remain in Banja
Luke may share the same fate.

NABLUS, West Bank —
About 900 Palestinian men
were set free from Israeli deten-
tion center yesterday, while
about two dozen women
remained detained.

As the men were released,
Israeli officials took the first
small step in their withdrawal
from the West Bank, pulling out
four towns to the jubilation and

jeers of Palestinians.

Israel originally said they
would release 1,200 male pris-
oners, but did not say who they
would be or when their freedom
would be granted. The New

Rooms

°From page I
“I’m in my room all the time.”

For those freshmen who have posted
something on their walls, specific sim-
ilarities can be found.

A must for any “cool” room is a
black light, said Tower B resident
Jason Lowens. A black light is a lamp
with a black-colored bulb that radiates
ultraviolet light when turned on.

Along with some black light—sensi-
tive items, a black light can instantly
turn any dull room into an awe-inspir-
ing one. Whether it’s a Bob Marley
black light poster or a boyfriend’s
name “painted” on the wall with liquid
laundry detergent, a blacklight is one
of the best college toys for under $40.

Another favorite donn accessory is a
collection of glow-in-the-dark stars.
Burgur, among many others, has trans-
formed her ceiling into a nighttime
celestial wonder. Some even have
planets or the constellation of the Big
Dipper radiating from above.

Favorites of any student are pho-
tographs and posters. These two dorm
room staples provide for the best sup-
ply of decorations. In freshman rooms,

those of one’s graduat-
ing class and ones of a
hometown boy/girl-
friend are the most

Valerie Biddle, who

knew each other before coming to Pitt,
discussed and coordinated room deco-
rations before ever arriving in Oakland
for Freshman Orientation.

“We talked about it as soon as we
found out we were rooming together,”
Satifka said.

The same is true for roommates
Burgur and Melissa Sekely, who
decided to make their room distinctive
by matching their two sides.

All the towels, pillows, bedspreads,

To “make the room
more colorful,” the two hung strings of
beads from their ceiling. The beads
hang down to the ﬂoor near the front
of their room, creating a mystic
entrance.

The room of Ketty Rugh and Sara ,

Saxby also creates a unique effect. An
over-sized collage of photos, posters
and a variety of nicknacks is sprawled
all over Ketty’s side.

Yet, besides the tapestry hanging in
the middle of the ceiling, not one item

sits upon Sara’s barren half of the
room. The night—and-day appearance
of the room creates an optical illusion.

Multimedia rooms, such as that of
guitarists and roommates Lowens and
Ryan Moore, can be some of the most
enjoyable to be in.

“We wanted a better atmosphere,”
Lowens said. “We also wanted a non-
traditional room.”

Above the dirty clothes and lacrosse
equipment piled on their floor rise two
electric guitars and two large speakers.

While listening to their solos and
gazing at the spiraling bears on their
black light Grateful Dead poster, visi-
tors can easily be plunged into a hyp-
notic trance.

Experimenting with the freedom to
do almost anything with a new room is
fun for any college student. And with
most freshmen used to living in hous-
es, decorating the small living space
available in the residence halls is an
easy way to feel good about being
here.

“Decorating is cool,” said Rosen.

“I’m able to sleep better with the way

I’ve done my room.”

activism is doing a great distur-
bance to our generation.”
Riemer also said that many
of Pitt’s students are here as a
result of social security bene-
ﬁts. Were it not for social secu-
rity, many of today’s elderly
would have been more depen-
dent on their children for sup-
port. In turn, the children sup-

porting their parents would

have less money to send their
own children to college.

Robert Myers, another one of
the panelists and former chief
actuary for the Social Security
Administration, said he feels
strongly that the system, as it
now stands, is secure for the
long-range future, and he attrib-
utes the current lack of faith in
the system to media bias.

Marmor also agreed the
media negatively influences
public conception of the sys-
tem.

“It’s very hard to make sense
of the [debate] because of the
way our press corps treats these
matters.”

Myers detailed what he
called “widespread erroneous
discussions” by addressing
some of the inherent miscon-
ceptions with the current sys-
tem.

One of the misconceptions is
the idea that the money that
should be in the social security
account has been spent by the
federal government.

“This is really not so,” Myers
said. “The money has been
invested in government bonds.”

According to Myers, the cur-
rent balance of the social secu-
rity trust fund is close to $485
billion, almost all of it invested
in interest—bearing government
bonds. —

“It is estimated that this bal-
ance will grow to $3.3 trillion
by the year 2019,” he said.

But Myers did say that at the
current rate, the system will go
bankrupt by the year 2030, a
predicament that was illustrated
in 1983, when the social securi-

ty system was on its way to.

bankruptcy until Congress
enacted legislation to curb the
downward slide.

“If the balance ever got too
low, the benefits would have to

.- be deferred,” Myers said. As

such, the system would not
vanish. Instead, the payments to
the recipients would just have
to be made several days later,
as the money came into the sys-
tem.

This situation is based on the
idea that there are to be no
changes in the system whatso-
ever. Myers proposed two
changes that he said would pre-
vent this scenan’-:3.

His first proposal is to slowly
raise taxes over the long run.
His second proposal is to raise
the retirement age.

“The retirement age should
be as high as 70, perhaps even
higher,” he said.

Myers concluded by offering
the motto that he intends to
have inscribed on his tomb-
stone: “Social security will out-
live us all.”

Opinions
Pillowcase rapist

Way to go, California. Call it the Left Coast or the land of
the fruits and nuts, whatever — this one is just plain insane.

In Torrance, about 50 miles outside of Los Angeles, the
state is releasing prisoner Reginald Muldrew, otherwise
known as the Pillowcase Rapist. He got that name _because
during his 200 or so rapes in the 1970s, he was known for
covering his victims heads with pillowcases.

Yes, that was 200 rapes. In fact, authorities in Los Angeles
County say Mr. Pillowcase ‘is responsible for 150 burglaries,
along with the 200 or so attacks. Police say he sometimes
raped a few women each night.

And after 17 years, at age 47, he is a free man. This is a
complete and total travesty of justice. Look at the number of
lives Mr. Pillowcase has affected. It‘s a hell of a lot more than
the 200 or so victims. Their parents, brothers, sisters, hus-

‘ bands, friends and countless others were all affected by this

rapist.

Rape is a violent, heinous crime that can destroy a woman’s
life. Seventeen years behind bars does not make up for
destroying one life, much less hundreds.

The judge who gave the original sentence and the people on
California’s parole board better hope their wives, mothers,
daughters and sisters have good bolt locks, because thanks to
them, Mr. Pillowcase is free and he might come knocking.

Perpetuating hatred

The Supreme Court of the United States, after opening this
term less than a month ago, is already being asked to decide
some highly controversial issues. The Court is presently being
asked to overturn a proposed amendment to Colorado’s constitu-
tion which denies homosexuals and bisexuals minority status
(thus denying discrimination claims based on sexual orientation).
A decision is expected to be handed down in July.

The present Court is, in essence, being asked to overturn a
1986 decision which permitted states to make criminal laws
against homosexual acts. .

The kind of law Colorado has proposed is causing quite a bit of
controversy because it breeches the forbidden ground of whether
or not homosexuality (like race, gender, handicap or nationality)
is a characteristic or a choice. There are studies which have
“proven” both arguments, and there really is no definitive
answer.

Colorado’s law, however, makes sense in a way that is not even
directly related to the issue of homosexuality. There has been a

-lot of debate in the past few years about affirmative action and

the era of the “Rights Revolution.” Civil rights are something
guaranteed to every person, and should not be denied to anyone.

But to continually divide people into groups, subgroups and
classes in order to give them special “protection” only perpetu-
ates (and possibly heightens) the hate and discrimination against
individuals who belong to those groups. No law can change the
inherent hatred that is inside some individuals. '

Albert

Simmons
mer day at a
n u r s e r y

school in the Pittsburgh area, a
little girl was left in a car with
the windows rolled up. An off-
duty police officer happened
by and rescued the child. _Shc
was taken to the hospital for
dehydration and released a
short time later. A couple days
later, the woman allegedly
responsible was indicted for
reckless endangerment.

°About 10 days before, in a
local nursery school, another
little girl was left in a vehicle.
She died. No charges were
filed, because the district attor-
ney could not find where there
was gross negligence, even
though the death was caused
by the lack of supervision. This
was the third time the owners
were guilty of lack of supervi-
sion. The owners were white.

Recently in predominantly
black North Philadelphia, six
police officers pleaded guilty
to evidence tampering and
theft. As a result, over 40 con-
victions have been overturned
and over 100 more are up for
review.

-Recently, an article in the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
revealed that blacks are sen-
tenced to 10 percent more jail
time than whites who have
committed similar crimes. The
feds wouldn’t release their
findings on the same study. I
wonder why.

These types of incidents and
circumstances happen fre-
quently in our society. And
that’s why Mark Gordon’s
Sept. 27 opinions column in
The Pitt News is disturbing. He
criticized the American Civil
Liberties Union for asking the
police not to violate people’s
constitutional rights in their
search for Tyree Booker, a sus-
pect in the murder of
Pittsburgh City Police Sergeant
James Taylor.

It’s unfortunate that with all

the police/black citizen con-
ﬂicts staring him in the face as
he reads the paper, he can’t
even fathom why the ACLU is
concerned. ‘

They’re concerned because
things could have gotten out of
hand. There could have been a
turkey shoot or a witch hunt
brewing where innocent people
could have been harassed, vic-
timized or even murdered.
Before Booker was captured a
picture of a black man, a black
woman and a white woman
with their hands “on the wall”
and the black man in handcuffs
made the front page. These
people were charged with
nothing. Why splatter their pic-
ture all over the front page?
Was it for some type of per-
verted entertainment? They
didn’t do anything. What if one
of them had to go to a job
interview the next day? It
amounts to character assassina-
tion.

The man in handcuffs didn’t
resemble Booker’s description,
although he might have been
as tall, and the other man in the
photo was at least six inches
shorter than Booker. (The
women bore obvious differ-
ences.) What were they
detained for? I’m sure the
police officers could come up
with a reason for probable sus-
picion; ‘that isn’t hard to do.
They could say they saw a
bulge in his pants or something
shiny in his hand. That’s strict-
ly a judgement call for emo-
tional officers who are trying
to avenge a fallen brother.

Internal Investigations units
don’t always work — they
missed Mark Fuhrman. They
do work side-by-side with the
police. And to do their job
effectively amounts to ratting
on one of their best friends. Do
you think that they may have a
problem with that? Sure it all
sounds good in theory, but put
the text book down — this is
the real world.

Another bad thing about
Internal Investigations units is

that before they go to work
they have to have a victim.
Somebody has to get hurt first.
The ACLU made its stand with
prevention in mind. They
wanted to head off a potential
tragedy.

I can’t deny that the crime
rate in the inner city is high,
but contrary to popular belief,
most blacks do not have a
criminal record and crime
appalls them. There are law-
abiding citizens living there
that have the right not to be
harassed. Most are sickened by
the murder of the police officer
and sickened by the fact that it
takes the murder of a police
officer for them to see the
criminal system work so zeal-
ously. They know that in their
neighborhood a murder doesn’t
get the same full-scale atten-
tion or results.

I feel sorry for the Taylor
family, but with all due respect
my world didn’t stop when
Sgt. Taylor died — if fates
were reversed I’m sure his life
wouldn’t stop. The light bill
came, I had to go to work and I
had class. I don’t need to be
held up against a wall or sitting
in a holding cell. I’m not
responsible for every black
man who commits a crime. We
have different values, thoughts
and beliefs like other races do.
Sorry for disturbing a fairy
tale, but black is the name of a
race of individuals. Black is
not a condition or a mindset.

The ACLU was concerned
for obvious reasons. It knows
history. Not the history of 300
years ago, but the history of
last month, last week. last
night, and they’d like to see it
stopped. I think they read the
newspaper and not just the sec-
tions that support a narrow
view of an opinion paper.

I hope the person who com-
mitted the murder of James
Taylor is tried and punished.
no matter what race he is. But
punish the deed, not the race.

peep e
make fun
of us

ast
weekI
saw

one of the
greatest col-
lege football
games in my

 

Colummt three years at
Matt Pitt. The two
‘Grove teams put on

a show that
kept every fan in their seat
until the final gun.
Everything was great; the
fans, the mascots and even
the cheerleaders were great.

Too bad I was at the Penn
-State-Ohio State game.

There cannot be a worse
feeling than having 96,000-
plus fans laugh when the pub-
lic address announcer croons,

“‘Second quarter Boston

College 7—Pitt 0.” There I
was, sitting amongst quite
possibly the most arrogant
fans in the entire world —
with a Pitt Football T-shirt
on.

You would not have
believed the witty things they
were saying to me. Stuff like,
“Go the fuck back to
Shittsburgh, you guys suck,”
and “Your quarterback
sucks.” I wish they would
have told me something I
didn’t know.

Right after the near-fight
over the John Ryan remark,
the public address announcer
said, “Boston College 10-Pitt
0.”

Think about how loud

’96,000 people would be

laughing their asses off. Yes,
laughingat Pitt. Fans at Pitt
games cheer when rival teams
are losing, but we get laughed
at. ’
Think about where the last
place is you want the
Panthers to visit next week.
Maybe Tallahassee to play

* ‘ the Seminoles, or perhaps

Lincoln to play . the
Cornhuskers. The Panthers
should be afraid to play the
Duquesne Dukes down the

7 street. Instead, Pitt visits

Veterans Stadium Saturday to
play the lowly Temple Owls.
Last year the Panthers beat
the Owls 45-19 at Pitt
Stadium. John Ryan had one
of his best games ever, throw-
ing for 330 yards and four
scores. That was the good 01’
John Ryan, not the one whose
stock is dropping even in the

g Arena League.

There has to be a change,
because obviously something
is terribly wrong with the Pitt
football picture. I remember
last season around this time

II's cl laaﬂle for Ihe basement

By Mike Kovak
Asst. Sports Editor

Last season against the
Temple Owls, Pitt quarter-
back John Ryan produced
one of his best performances
as a Panther.

Ryan completed 18 passes
for 330 yards and a career-
high-tying four touchdown
passes in the Panthers’ 45-
19 dismantling of the Owls.

The win was considered to
be the Panthers’ most
impressive outing in a sea-
son that saw Pitt go 3-8 for
the second consecutive sea-
son. '

“John Ryan just shredded
us last‘ year,” said Temple
head coach Ron Dickerson.

' “He did a tremendous job

and has been a tremendous

asset to their program thus
far as their quarterback.”
Many Pitt fans would like
to dispute this statement.
This season, Pitt has lost
four consecutive games after
winning its first two, in
compiling a 2-4 record. The
losses against Virginia Tech
and Texas are games Pitt
would like to have back.
Last week’s loss against
Boston College dug a deep
hole for the Panthers. Now,
the Temple game, which
originally looked like a lock,

is a must-win situation for a

team that has lost the taste
for victory,

“This is an extremely
important game for us,” Pitt
head coach Johnny Majors
said. “We should have a
feeling of urgency about the

ball game.”

Many fingers have been
pointed at Ryan for Pitt’s
recent slide.

Ryan, who ranks fifth on
Pit_t’s all-time career passing
yardage list, has struggled
this season.

After posting a 159.7 effi-
ciency rating last year,
Ryan’s rating has dipped to

.l02.7, which ranks him sev-

enth in the quarterback-
heavy Big East Conference.
Through the first six
games, Ryan has completed
97 of 191 passes (51 per-
cent). His 1,239 passing
yards puts him nearly 300
yards ahead of his next com-
petitor, WVU’s Chad
Johnston. Ryan is tied for
the conference lead in touch-
down passes with seven. He

is tied with Temple quarter-
back Henry Burris. Ryan
also leads the Big East in
throwing interceptions. For
the year, he has already
tossed 14 passes to the

wrong team, five more than

any other quarterback in the
conference.

Ryan needs to return to
last year’s form in order to
salvage Pitt’s season, or at
least play as well against the
Owls this year as he did last
year

According to Majors, exe-
cution will be the key
against Temple.

“We should try to improve
our execution drastically on
offense. Execution could
help us 50 percent by step-
ping properly and improving
our footwork,” Majors said.

Wide receiver Dietrich Jells (left) is doubtful for Saturday’s game

Jim Madl/Staff Photographer
against Temple with a

sprained ankle. Running back Billy West(right) is out for the year with a fractured fibula.

Last week, the Pitt offense
lacked execution. The team
tallied 94 total yards and
minus-ll rushing yards.
Ryan also threw two key
interceptions, including one
on a second-and-goal situa-
tion.

There appears to be help
on the way for the Panther
ground game.

Starting center Reggie
Thomas looks ready to play,
as does fellow starter right
tackle Tony Orlandini.
Receiver Dietrich Jells and
runner Demetrius Harris
look doubtful for the game.
Denorse Mosley and Billy
West are out for the season.

“Our weapons are limit-
ed,” Majors said. “But our
cohesion and execution
should be better than what it
was last week. The team can
play better by having better
technique and by doing the
little things better.”

Ava/anc/1e invade the Western conference

By Marc Rosenberg
For The Pitt News

It’s amazing how one team can total-
ly alter the look of a league’s division
or conference. This is the case for the
National Hockey League’s Western
Conference. What was once a wide
open race has been transformed into a
close one. '

The battle for the top spot in the
West will come down to only a few
teams. However, it should be an excit-
ing race between the Detroit Red
Wings, St. Louis Blues and Colorado
Avalanche.

For the Detroit Red Wings, the big
question is which goalie to start. Mike
Vernon had a spectacular 1995 regular
season. However, he was a bust in last
year’s finals, as he and the Wings were
swept by New Jersey. “Backup” Chris
Osgood, however, is on the brink of
becoming one of the league’s premier
goaltenders. Coach Scotty Bowman
likes Vernon, but the front office is
pushing Osgood. One of these men
will be dealt by mid-season. ,

Like few NHL teams, Detroit show-

r cases an awesome array of talent.

 

Center Sergei Federov, Keith Primeau,
captain Steve Yzerman, defenseman
Paul Coffey and forward Dino
Ciccarelli are all back for the 1995-96
Red Wings. Rumors have Yzerman
and Ciccarelli headed out of town.
Regardless, the Red Wings will be in
good shape to defend their Central
Division crown.

Mike Keenan’s St. Louis Blues, who
boast the most acquisitions over the
off-season, will give Detroit a run for
its money. The general manager/coach
spent over $25 million in signing free
agents Dale Hawerchuk, Geoff
Courtnall, former Ranger Brian
Noonan, netminder Grant Fuhr and
Oiler Shayne Corson. He also ran for-
ward Brendan Shanahan out of town to
Hartford, in exchange for defenseman
Chris Pronger.

The question again, is goaltending. '

Will Grant Fuhr maintain his weight?
Can any goalie on this team do the
job? Not likely. That’s why Keenan
will add the final piece to the puzzle

. during the season, trading foran estab-

lished netman.
The team predicted to run away with
the Pacific division, of course, is the

Colorado Avalanche. Formerly
known as the Quebec Nordiques,
Colorado is stacked with scoring,
including Art Ross prospect Joe Sakic,
1995 NHL Rookie of the Year Peter
Forsberg, Owen Nolan and recently
acquired Conn Smythe Trophy winner
Claude Lemieux. Lemieux came to the
Avalanche from New Jersey last week
in a three-way deal.

Colorado’s defense is equally strong
with Uwe Krupp, Curtis Leschyshyn,
Sylvain Lefebvre and veteran Craig
Wolanin leading the charg e .
Fiset and Joceyln Thibault will again
compete for the starting job between
the pipes. Although both looked good
last season, look for Thibault to win
the number one spot. The third-year
puckstopper went 12-2-2 last season
with a 2.34 goals against average.

Goaltender Kirk McLean needs to
play better than that if the Vancouver
Canucks want any shot at winning the
Pacific. McLean led the Canucks to
second place last season with a 2.75
goals against average and a 90.4 save
percentage.

However, he won’t have to do it

yanked and Ryan stepped in.
Ryan was impressive while

, leading the Panthers to two

wins in the final three games.

The time has come for a
major overhaul. Maybe some
new jerseys or guest alumni
players. I would love to see
Matt Cavanaugh throw to
Orlando Truitt in the
Homecoming game against
the ‘Canes, but that won’t
happen. It has to be some-
thing realistic to save the sea-
son; the same season that
many, including myself, saw
culminating with a bowl bid.
The tough-luck Panthers now
have to shoot to top the three-
win plateau for the first time
in three years.

Many people are asking
what happened. It’s not hard
to explain the skid when
players like West, Jells,
Harris and Mosley are on the
sidelines.

Why is it always the poor
Panthers with skill players
dropping like ﬂies? Why does
Pitt have to be the laughing-
stock of the Northeast year in

and year out? These‘ are ques- 5

tions searching for answers
that can't be found. At least
not found by Pitt coaches or
players.

I’m scared for this weekend
— scared to death. Temple
has never won a Big East
game in three years. That is
0-21, but after a respectable
showing against Syracuse last
week, the Owls have nothing
to lose coming into
Saturday’s game. The
Panthers, on the other hand,
could take a huge dive with a
loss at Temple.

I’m all for the big upset
most of the time, but if histo-
ry is made Saturday at
Veterans Stadium, college
football at Pitt may be a thing
of the past. Look on the
bright side though, only two
days until Midnight Madness.

alone. With a front line
of Mike Ridley, "Pavel
Bure and Alexander
Mogilny, Vancouver should
tickle the twine often. Add
Trevor Linden, Russ
Courtnall and Cliff Ronning
to the equation, and this
squad will be sending
opposing clubs back to the
locker rooms crying.

While the Chicago
Blackhawks are not favored
to win 'the_ Central or the
West, they are legitimate
Cup contenders come play-
off time. While 25-year-old
center Jeremy Roenick is
hitting his prime, the sun is
setting for middle men
Bernie Nicholls (34), Denis
Savard (34) and Brent Sutter
(33).

Rookie head coach Craig
Hartsburg must deal with an
aging defense as well.
Thirty-three-year-old cap-
tain Chris Chelios plays as
if he’s still in his ' 20s.
However, Cam Russell, at
26, is Chicago’s youngest
defender.

The Calgary Flames will
have to play on their heads
the entire season to stay in
the division hunt. Calgary
does have scoring in 5—foot-
6 forward Theo Fleury, left
winger Gary Roberts and
9-year veteran Joe
Nieuwendyk. Unfortunately,

WASl1lNqTON, D.C.

the Flames were dealt two
huge blows over the summer

With powerhouse
Colorado and Vancouver
in their division, making
the playoffs should be
the primary goal of the San
Jose Sharks. The Sharks
are primarily the same
team that took the ice last
season. Rookie Viktor
Kozlov looks to make a big
impact — literally — after
missing last year with a

Center Doug Gilmour

Dead Presidents
Written by Michael Henry
Brown, Allen Hughes and
Albert Hughes

Directed by Allen and Albert
Hughes

With Larenz Tate, Keith David
and Chris Tucker

When I first saw the trailers
for Dead Presidents, I remem-
ber not exhaling until it was
over. Looking back, maybe I
should have suffocated. At first
I thought the new Hughes
brothers’ film was a heist film.
It turned out to be a collage of
scenes from the past 20 years
of ltalian-American films, but
with a predominantly black
cast.

from Goodfellas in his ciga-

than Jules” Kirby (Keith
David). Any of you remember
The Godfather Part /I? Michael
Corleone (Al Pacino) tells his
family at his father's birthday
that he plans to enlist in the
army, and Sonny calls him an
idiot for deciding to do so.
Ironically enough, Anthony
Curtis sits down to dinner with
his family and practically re-
enacts the famous scene (all
the way down to his older
brother calling him an idiot).
Besides the helicopter eclips-
ing the sun shot which was a
direct rip-off from Apocalypse
Now, the Vietnam sequence
was the only part of the movie

‘that lived up to the trailer’s

promise of an action movie.
Gore fans may want to attend
just for the battle carnage.
Post-war, Anthony takes on
a Travis Bickelesque role as a
disgruntled war veteran with
no place to go but back to his

youth as a numbers runner.
Back to Kirby’s pool hall, which
I think is the exact pool hall
from Mean Streets where the
famous Johnny-the-boy
(young Robert DeNiro) leads a
frantic poolstick beatdown.
Would it surprise you if
Anthony (already in the form of
Travis, the infamous taxi-dri-
ver) now metamorphisizes into
yet another DeNiro cast off -
a.k.a Johnny-the-boy — where
he too takes up a poolstick to

All in all, this is not the whole
story. Actually, it’s hardly any
of the story. However, I would
like to give an honorable men-
tion to the one-legged bandit
Kirby who may have been the
only original element in the
whole movie. His one-legged
ass whomp of a debtor who is
past due is one for the annals.

Keep in mind that in the
Hughes Brothers’ Menace Il_
Society, they blatantly admit-

    
  

ted taking the story from
Goodfellas. I only wish they
had not been so obvious in try-
ing it again with Dead
Presidents. Lifting stories and
images is not New Wave cine-
ma: “the fistful of films” Sergio
Leone remade were from
Chinese cinema. Even more
recently, look at the similarities
between Reservoir Dogs and
City on Fire. Attention all film
geeks: the ripoff can be done.

Urge Ovrkll

Exit the Dragon
Geffen

There's not much I can say
about these fogies except .that
they did that “Pulp Fiction”
thing and the lead vocalist,
Nash Kato,‘ has extremely poor
posture. is that sufficient?
Okay? Do you have a clear
idea of what “Exit the Dragon"
sounds like? No? Shucks!

Well, to me, Urge Overkill
has that certain “VH-1" type of
appeal which isn’t awful, but
l’m not 30. Perhaps I am too
immature to enjoy this album.
Good! (I am trying to be polite
and have respect for my
elders: how am I doing so far?)
Songs like “The Break” and
“Jaywalk" have a forced vigor
that reveals an honest attempt
to sound cool, but to no avail.

  

Granted, they do know their
instruments and have crystal
clear vocals which is neat, but
it’s a little too neat. There’s no
chaos on this album. Not to
say that there has to be, but,
well, there has to be.

I like, I like, I like!!! l’m sorry,
but I love this one. This album
brings back memories that I
never had but wish I did. It
successfully helped me
through my English paper this
weekend. It's so great! Every
song is like a different album.
“Billy” sings lead vocals on
track eight! Alan Moulder.
Need I say more, people?

Of course. The first compli-
ment that I want to impart is a
big fat kiss to the Starchildren.
Can I reveal my fanaticism
now? -Starchildren is Billy
Corgan’s new musical moon-
child. The sound still maintains

iness (If such a word exi_sts),
thank God, but it's newer and
non-narcissistic. Their tribute
is “|so|ation,” which is an elec-
tro-jangle of tamed vocals and
spacey dischord. I ate it up
with a sterling silver soup
spoon!

Kendra Smith’s track, “Heart
and Soul,” has a neo-interstel-
lar appeal and naughty drum
beats that lay out the red car-
pet for her sultry vocals. Let’s
see, what else??? Oh yeah,
Moby sings! The Christian
vegan raver drops a tune or
two on his rawksy remix of
“New“Dawn Fades” from his
“Move” ep. I worry about him
sometimes.

And Codeine! They have
some of the best vocals on the
entire comp. I had no idea
people our age could sing so
well! Either that or the tech-
nology is pretty damn good.

I don’t think you will like the
Joy Division Comp. Why? lt’s
too good to be really liked. It
will most likely be ridiculed for
its hypnotizing appeal. But I
like it! And that's what really
matters, so get it if you can.
And re-acquaint yourself with
covers by Stanton-Miranda.

Campfire Girls
Mood Enhancer ep
lnterscope

Campfire Girls is one of
those jokes in which you have
to wait a long, long time for the
punchline, only to realize that
you’ve heard it before and
didn’t laugh. The album would
do better as an instrumental (I
say that about all albumsl).
The chord work is catchy, but
the vocals are rather slippery
and typical. Not impressive.

Okay, now that you’ve read
the first paragraph, you’ve got
the idea, and you're ready to
move on to another review.
Well, so am I. And such is the
effect of Mood Enhancer.

l’m sorry, but they didn’t start
any forest fires with this ep.
Smokey would be pleased, but
l’m not.

Palace Brothers

Viva Last Blues
Palace Records/Drag City

Since rock n’ roll is a semi-
nal American art form, image
has always been at least as
important as the music itself, in
the eyes (sometimes ears) of
the audience. Musicians (or
their managers) have been
creating personae for them-
selves sincewell before the
days of Chuck Berry and Mr.
Presley. Just like practically
every rapper today, jazz and
blues musicians of the past
often used nicknames, or
“stage names,” if they were
fortunate enough to have
stages to play on.

The invention of television
further soaked an already
image-soaked Western cul-
ture. Parents would rage at the
images projected by the pop
stars who lip-synched on the
tube, probably more so than at

so (2)
by iusfin hopper

Not unlike the Nicholas
Cage character in Red Flock
West, I find myself continually
being driven back into town by
a drunken, maniacal Dennis
Hopper, holding my bleeding
nose as I glance through
blackened eyes at the sign
that says: Now Entering The
Pitt News, Population 23. This
time around, however, there’s
fresh-brewed coffee, RUN-
DMC and a picture of Boss

Cristina, to jump start the vari-

Thursday, Oct. 11: Fear and

The Bloomfield Bridge
Tavern, or Mecca—ski, plays
host to a maddened evening of
attitude-free weirdness. Step
Left Foot, Pittsburgh’s indie
underdogs, go into the steel
cage with the Loveless, the
deranged pop-punk product of
a large bald man’s' large bald
mind. Where have all the tears
gone? That’s the question
posed by the Loveless: a
breath of fresh sweat in a
clean-punk world. There are
two kinds of pop-punk bands
in this world: First, there’s The
Green Day Experience, who
scream and whine about not
being able to get a date, only
to return to their fashionably
fucked-up apartments to screw
their fashionably fucked-up
groupies. Then, there’s the
Loveless, who scream and

Ugly ones!

Step Left Foot? We’ve been
carrying a torch for them for
years ‘round these parts, and
we won't stop until they stop
making those exciting, scary,
almost infuriating sculptures
out of the coffin which rock
was buried in. When you see
them tonight at the BBT (that
IS what we’re dis-
cussing, right? God, 
I keep getting dis-
tracted by-the Boss
Hog promo shot ...),
make sure to look
for the six-inch hump
growing out of their
singer’s back. It's
apparently VERY
painful, so slap him
on the back for a job
well done after the ‘
show: The doctors
gave him" six
months, and that
was nine months
ago already. Slainté,
Terry!

For the third time in as many
years, it's time to remind you
all that there is NO beach in
Pittsburgh. What we do have
is an unspoken agreement
with the unchallenged King of
the Surf Guitar, Dick Dale, to
stop by Graffiti with some of
his Taoist beach blanket music
every year, and this Saturday
he'll fulfill his part of the bar-

  

gain. Our side of the deal is to
make sure that more people,
in a wider variety of bowling
shirts, show up each year to
either dance like Annette, or
stare in amazement at Dick‘s
29 Palms-bred fingertips as he
bends his strings, and our
minds, through the world’s
biggest reverb-a-thon. Dale
has an uncanny ability to take
an art form, Surf
Music, which has
been turned into a
shtick by years of
misuse, and return it
to sender, replacing
the soul that is at its
sunny core. For
more information on
this rebirth of surf,
show up on time for
Graffiti’s opening,

and watch local
stars, the Mt.
McKinleys. (See

also Wednesday,
Oct. 18). Donations
to pay for entry for
Pittsburgh’s only
professional surfer,
Malah, can be sent

Wednesday, Oct. 18: The
Conclusion.

This conclusion is drawn into
two parts, the first being pre-
sented at Cloud Nine in the
Strip District, the second at
Graffiti again. Drop the cap-
sule, and call a cab 

Cloud Nine, Oct. 18: the first
day of the rest of Bedazzled
Records’ lives. The East Coast
American answer to Britain's
legendary 4AD releases the
first full-length CD by
Pittsburgh’s swoon artists
Underflowers in the Strip on
this night, to a Gabrielic chorus
of violins and chimes.
Underflowers play music some
would call Goth, but, as
Kierkegaard said, to label is to
disempower. However,
Kierkegaard was a drunken
dope-fiend who never wrote
record reviews, so I shall call
Underflowers’ music “psyche-
delic Victorian pagan-folk.”
The concert will also include
atmospheric pop from label-
mates Mistle Thrush, who
appear with Underflowers on

“I like to get really drunk and stoned
when I read my work. I feel that it really
helps my performance to work a lot
beﬁen"

So said poet John Giorno in an inter-
view during the now infamous “Cities of
the Red Night” reading tour that he
embarked on with the 1 million times
more infamous William Burroughs in

1981. Although Giorno engages in -

meditation and Zen Buddhism these
days, it's doubtful he has completely
abandoned the old-fashioned way of
getting in touch with the spiritual
realms of the human psyche.

Giorno doesn’t so much read his
poetry as hammer it into his audience's
skulls. He has used a band and then-
new technology like digital delay to ele-
vate his performances above the typi-
cal dead, boring poetry reading.

Giorno has been a fairly revolution-
ary figure ever since he slept his way
through a starring role in Andy
Warhol's film Sleep. He introduced the
world to Dial-A-Poem back in 1968.
Basically, this meant that anyone could
call his apartment and hear a pre-
recorded poem, read by a different
poet each week. Dial-A-Poem lasted
for five months, and 1,112,337 people

took advantage of the opportunity to
hear poetry over the telephone.

He founded the “non-profit tax-
exempt umbrella organization” Giorno
Poetry Systems record and video label
in 1968, and has been putting out col-
lections of recorded poetry and music
since then. Glenn Branca, Laurie
Anderson, William Burroughs, Allen
Ginsburg, Nick Cave and Jim Carroll
are just a few of the folks who‘ have
been featured on Giorno’s compilations
over the years.

Another interesting Giorno project
was the “edible poetry” limited-edition
inscribed chocolate bars he commis-
sioned as part of his “Consumer
Product Poetry” series (1968-74).
Other items in the series included poet-
ry printed on matchbooks, t-shirts, win-
dow curtains and flags. Some of
Giorno’s other books include Cancer in
My Left Ball and The American Book of
The Dead.

For over a decade now, Giorno has
run the AIDS Treatment Project, which
distributes cash to people with AIDS if
they ask for it, to be used for whatever
they need the money for. The Project
has raised more than $450,000 since
its inception.

8300 for details.

“|t’s a blessed project,” said Giorno‘,
“People just keep giving me money to
give to others, and I've never had to
turn anyone down.”

Giorno’s basic theory from the begin-
ning has been that art (including poet-
ry, which, even compared to visual ar,t
pays less than nothing), money and
popular culture are not incompatible
elements, even in today's hyper-accel-
erated, consumer society. This is the
fuel that drives his spoken-word
recordings and sweat-drenched perfor-
mances. Friday night will mark his first
appearance in Pittsburgh, and there’s
a good chance he'll describe the times
Andy Warhol sucked on his toes while
Giorno masturbated. That's reason
enough to check it out. I guarantee that
it will beat the patent leather pants off
of any other poetry performance you've
seen.

See Giorno in action Friday night at
the Warhol Museum. He will “read”
from his newest collection of poetry
and prose, you got to burn to shine at

the Bedazzled Records’ compi-
lation Wake Up Smiling, cer-
tainly worth the money.

ORI Try your hand, once
more, at the wave-world Graffiti
has transformed itself into this
week. They are carting in 16
tons of sand from Bikini Atoll to
make a radioactive Beach
Blanket Bingo setting welcom-
ing Man or Astro-Man. MoA-M
are amongst the chosen few of
Dick Dale's worthy followers,
those who think of the sounds
before the beaches. Their
strange and wonderful astro-
naut/North Shore sounds have
found them friends amongst
almost all who hear them.
Opening the show will be
Pittsburgh rockabilly heavy-
weights The Tremblers, who
have more than the hair on
their side. Listen to the guitars.

' Will you survive this week? I
didn’t even mention Gregory
Peck reading Yeats at the
Carnegie on the 18th, and I
don’t want to even THINK
about what John Giorno is
going to do at the Warhol on
Friday the 13th (See T.
Carroll). What a bestial seven
days. Good luck.

the raucousness of the music
made by those folks. Record
jackets helped to catalyze a
band‘s image, and the easily
digestable hit single has been
the most common method of
actually hearing a band's
music.

The right look has always
been essential to any 20th-
century Western teenager's
sense of identity. When the
Beatles hit the scene, they all
dressed the same and had the
same haircuts. Mr. Presley
knew how to do th hip shake
thang. Andy Warhol trans-
formed the Velvet
Underground into a multi-
media spectacle, The
Exploding Plastic Inevitable.
The late David Bowie took
cues from the Velvets and Iggy
and the Stooges and con-
structed a new persona for
each new album and tour, until
his unfortunate musical death
in the late 1970s. The glam
scene he helped spawn was
full of folks who changed their
names (Gary Glitter, Johnny
Thunders) and experimented
with androgyny. And who can
forget Kiss; I mean I always
thought that the point of that
band was just to suck real bad
and to look real bad, too.

tionally been an art form for
the proletariat, some caution
must be exercised by musi-
cians when constructing their
personae. Often times, artists
strive just a bit too hard to
appear spontaneous and free
of pretension, only to seem
real silly in the process (see
John Cougar Mellencamp and
The Boss).

Everyone knows the Punk
Rock Fairy Tale, in which the
punkers came along to slaugh-
ter the boring, bloated Beast of
‘70s arena rock. Less finally
was more, and any kid could
pick up or steal a guitar, name
him or herself Polly Styrene or
Pat Smear, and proceed to
make some noise.

Then came the ‘80s, and the
invention of the single-most
destructive weapon ever wield-
ed against the creative spirit:
MTV. This was the era of crea-
tures with names like Boy
George and Madonna, who
changes her image as often as
she changes her clothes, or
buys new clothes, or has her
handlers buy her clothes, or
has famous designers design
her clothes, or whatever kind
of sick shit goes on inside the
Madonna Celebrity Machine
Factory. Slightly more interest-
ing is the case of the King of
Pop, whose music sucks just

as bad as Madonna’s, but
who, in the words of his lovin’
lamb, Lisa Marie, “has fash-
ioned himself into a work of
art.”

So we’ve all got the point
now about construction of per-
sonae in rock music, right?
OK, moving right along, the
so-called indie rock scene of
the last 10 years or so gener-
ally sticks to the DIY, minimal-
ist ethics of PUNK ROCK,
often times eschewing the the-
atrics that Malcolm McLaren
found so helpful in the selling
of bondage gear and ripped
trousers. Records released on
Chicago's Drag City label have
always had a pretty cryptic air
about them, in terms of myste-
rious cover art and a lack of
band info on the jacket.
Releases by Louisville's
Palace Brothers have been
typical of this cryptic approach.

Will Oldham is the song-
writer for this band with an
amorphous lineup that usually
includes his brother Ned, also
on guitar, and has been called
Palace Songs, plain old
Palace and now Palace Music.
There is something really phe-
nomenal about a man who can
sing really beautiful, incestu-
ous love songs about his sister
convincingly enough to bring
me to tears (literally).

OIdham's voice and delivery of
fictional and archetypal tales
bespeak a wonderful sincerity
that, in my opinion, outdoes
Bob Dylan, who I love.

There are a lot of similarities
between Dylan and Palace
Music, musically and in terms
of the construction of a myste-
rious, deceptively simple per-
sona. The character Oldham
has created for himself is that
of a backwoods Kentucky hick,
though his lyrics are among
the most poetic in music made
by any band today. The music
has always been kept as spare
as possible, with the drums
holding everything together in
a dead-on, yet somehow
loose, manner.

Viva Last Blues is the third
full-length Palace record, and
about their seventh or eighth
release, counting EPs and sin-
gles. This album follows the
same course as previous
releases, although it is slightly
tighter. This is still hauntingly
dark country music, but there
is almost a bit of an R&B feel
thrown in on this one. Most of
the songs are fairly somber, as
far as lyrics go, although
Oldham lightens up a bit and
even manages to display a the
ability to write a damn good
pop song on a few tunes, most

are hit with a collage of avant-
garde feminism. Everything,
down to the overlapping of
lines and unshapely character
objectives, has political mes-
sages sewn in. Pope Joan,
who supposedly reigned in
Rome disguised as a man,
poses the idea that women
often have to give up woman-
hood altogether to have power
or success. The clever aspects
of liberated women are
touched upon consistently
within this idea. The women
who work in The Top Girls
Employment Agency openly
confide with each other the sly,
deviant tactics they use to
achieve status among the
male executives. This means

to hear to understand. When
he sings the word/expression

“oh," it seems to mean a whole *

lot more than just “oh.” Every
time his voice cracks you can
feel the real, heartfelt senti-

V ments he so easily conveys,

yet sometimes it's really hard
to tell if‘ he means what he
sings, as the songs about his
sister Lisa on previous albums

‘ clearly illustrate.

Jason Lowenstein of
Sebadoh, a band with a fairly
low persona factor, or, more
accurately, a non-persona
(other than lovesick) persona
band, plays drums on this one.
Ned Oldham plays bass and
slide guitar, and Liam Hayes
does some tremendous piano
and organ playing. A fellow
named Brian also plays some
guitar leads, making this the
most musically complex
Palace record yet. It never
seems like too much, though,
which is what I meant when I
said it was “tight.” The shit def-

-initely ain't sloppy. It's really
just perfect music, sung by a
man with a convincing per-
sona that doesn’t seem like a
persona, sort of like Bob
Po||ard’s faux-British accent
that doesn’t hinder the believ-
ability factor in Guided By
Voices, even when his lyrics
are nonsensical.

Oldham extolls the virtues of
friends and family, and
laments the loss of time due to
the necessity of work. Well, he
certainly has a lot of help from
his friends and family on this
one, and, as he sings on the
album’s finale, he does work
hard. Hard work pays off in
creating one of the most
believable characters in rock
music today. Viva Palace
music!
