At an A.W.S. Commission meet-
ing last Wednesday, a code ‘of
standards concerning women’s
dress on campus was adopted.
This code, affecting all Univers-
ity women, was recommended by
the women’s Housing Board,
headed by Bobby Ossip.

According «to the new code:
“Dress is more than comfort at-
tire. We should dress.appropriate—
ly for. the occasion. The students
should realize that we live in an
‘urban community and therefore.
.we should tend to dress as adult
women.” l

The code also stipulates that

Student Government Assn. will discuss and vote on the
proposed constitution at its regular meeting today. The ses-
sion-will begin at 2 p.m., an hour earlier than -usual, to give_
the body enough time togo "over the new constitution. _

SGA held at special. meeting last Thursday night for this
-same purpose. But after two and one—half hours of discussion

there was no quorum.

If the constitution is approved
today, it will then be presented to
the’ entire -"student body for its
vote. This referendum will prob-
ably be held around the begin-
ning of next year. "

SGA. The executive branch, un-
der the ’_proposed document will
consist of the president, vice
president and the executive de-
partment. The chief executive,
who will be known as the “Presi-

_ be electedfor three" trimesters.

.A majorchange in the pow-

Finals Don 't Fit

When college students have nothing better to argue
about, the eternal issue. of ﬁnal examintions is resurrected
for another general denunciation. Aside from the routine
dislike for any kind of stiff academic test, students have for

    

 

a long time seriously questionel the efficacy of the ﬁnal-

exam as an instrument for learning and as an accurate de-
termination of the individual’s.mastery of a given subject.
Over the long years which constitute the academic tra-

. dition, however, “ﬁnals” have become an institution, a kind

, of “sine qua non” in the professor’s repertoire of pedagogical
devices. Under certain circumstances and in certain ﬁelds
the “ﬁnal” is an excellent means to the end of consolidating
-the information, even knowledge, which a student has stored
up over the period of four months.

It is not our purpose— here to evaluate the merits of the

opposing philosophies ‘in this ancient debate, but rather to
consider the aspects of the “examinations” which are to be
given at this university during the week of Dec. 13, the ﬁn-al
five days of the trimester calendar. .
When the 15-week trimester was adopted, it was obvi
ous to the planners that there would not be enough time to

include an examination period. When the long-awaited cal-'

endar was unveiled, the sharp-eyed noticed the omission

immediately. When asked about exams, the planners an—_

swered that noexam time had been set aside.
The dilemma for the faculty was not a terribly difficult
one. If the administration provides no special period, we

Twill take the last week of the trimester for the traditional.

exercises. Accordingly, there will be no regular classes as
such-during that ﬁnal hectic week——just exams, and-hour
exams at that.
I The ﬁnal exam at the university has been a two-hour
affair in the past. Some claimed, and with good reason, that
“two hours were ‘insufficient to do the job properly. If the
?‘ﬁna1” is to be comprehensive, they said, "then let us have
the time to make it just that. Challenging essay questions
cannot be thoroughly handled in just two hours.

Now, the situation verges on the ridiculous. There is

no extended time interval in which to discuss thoughtfully

hard propositions. Instead, most professors are planning two
or three-part tests during their regular 50-minute sections.
-These professors also have been informed that they must
have all ﬁnal grades into the registrar’s office by 5 p.m.
Friday, Dec. 19, The result will be that students with four
or ﬁve subjects Monday, Wednesday and Friday probably
will have “ﬁnals” all crammed into Monday and Wednesday
of that nightmarish week.

‘There is a plan in the works to give overloaded stu-
dents (meaning everyone) the opportunity to take some of
these truncated tests at hours other than their regular class

‘ time, presumably in monitored classrooms. This, we submit,

is merely throwing ascrap to the beleagured student body.
The trouble is that the entire purpose of the ﬁnal ex-
amination, namely a concentrated, comprehensive test of

,. One. Before the Other . . .

Two Steps of To

By Deborah Willson

Intolerance is probably the greatest threat to.

education that exists. It closes men’s minds to
others’ ideas and stunts their learning process,
making them complacent in what they know, or
think they know, to be The Truth.

Probably the biggest responsibility of the uni-
versity, then, is to help its stu-r ‘
dents acquire tolerance and_ keep
it. Sounds trite, doesn’t" it? Inia
sense tolerance is trite; it is a
word much talked about, onelto
which many lofty sentiments are
attached, but which are too sel-

First of all there is intellec-I

ﬁne. This means accepting others’
ideas on a level equal to your
own and examining the basis for ‘ _

them before accepting or rejecting them. It means
also accepting criticism of traditional standardsand
schools of thought, and being willing to examine,
indeed to reject them if found inadequate or irra-
-tional. ' ‘

Deeper than Appearances

. The reason, however, that such intellectual toll-.

erance is so easy to deﬁne, yet so difficult to attain,
is that it must be preceded by what might also
be termed “emotional tolerance” perhaps to be
equated with emotional maturity. — ‘

Too many of us manage to escape from the
university without acquiring this kind of maturity;
we go “into the world” still clutching our irrational
ideas and beliefs, defending them. against attack
by every bit of irrationality we can conjure up.
We remain Republicans because our mothers ‘told

.us to, and if anyone asks us why_we huff with

indignation and say, “Because its right, that’s why!”

On the other hand, people who have attained
this kind of maturity can afford to be. truly toler-
ant. They can ‘afford to let other people criticize
their ideas to think differently, to consider the pos-
sibility that someone else might be right.
Dormitory Opportunities

Tolerance, or lack of'it, with reference to ideas
and standards is most noticeable and perhaps some-
times most cultivated within the university in

dormitory living. Not only do dormitory talking
sessions bring the student into contact with others’

Verbalized standards, but successful adjustment to’

this kind of living necessitates some degree of tol-
erance on somebody’s part. The trouble is, that too
often the tolerance.in this case is on the part of
the wrong people. The people who have examined
their beliefs and standards are often those who

Ierancei 

have abandoned some of the traditionally held ones, '

and who sometimes do not realize how Different
(horrible word)! they are until they come into
close contact with those who have not.
Certainly there are many levels of morality in
this world, for example, and the highest is not
necessarily the‘ best. Now don’t get me wrong!
I’m not advocating rampant immorality —— far from
it. The point is, that any kind of moral standards

standards as adequate for that person, if not for

himself, are not the standards of an educated
person. , ' -
Signs of Education

I'would not consider tolerant, for example, the
girl, not at this school, who complained of the low

standards of a girl who she claimed was displaying""’;
obscene pictures on her wall. The “pictures” were,

some of Renoir’s ﬁnest paintings.

The religion of an educated person is, likewise, -A

not a religion too rigid to prevent him from re-
specting someone else’s beliefs. If a standard,
whether of morality or of religion, cannot stand

‘questioning even when the "question is in the form

of another’s action,,it does not deserve to be _a
standard. The educated person_is not one who is
easily “shocked” at-another’s behavior.

This sort of person, too, will be able to view‘

his own and others’ behavior in perspective, not
overemphasiznig the importance of insigniﬁcant
things. It is not a tolerant person, for example,
who broods for days. because somebody used his
toothpaste without asking. Understanding and ac-
cepting others’ behavioral “faults” if you will, and
their standards and beliefs is, then the kind of
tolerance to be cultivated by those who are truly
educated. “Tolerant”, people live together _more
successfully._ If the university can foster this qual-
ity in its students, ‘it has fulﬁlled a vastly im-
portant role. '

Continues Criticism

(Editor’s note: The following
letter was sent to Deborah
Willson concerning her .col-
umn, “The Importance of Im-
portance,” which appeared in
the issue of Nov. 9. In the
above- column Miss Willson
does not profess‘ to be “fun-'
nyy) \ K.

Dear- Miss Willson:

It certainly is sad that. you
failed in your attempt to write
with your ink-well behind your
back. It may have helped.

I don’t feel that you’ve found
your place in the scheme of
“The‘Pitt 1\Iews.” I am not (1)
a professional critic, (2) a re-
former,‘(3) a crank, or even (4)
a Poet. I just like to help people
whether they want it or not.

Your mistake is that you got
off on the wrong foot and have
kept up the good work. From
what you do come out with, I

can ‘see the spark of genius.

(especially the bit about the
“We'll all be dead in 80 years

anyway.” If Ina Amdur would ,_

have left it alone, I’d have
thought it out all by myself and
been happy). The trouble is that
your spark of geniushas no re-
flector and it’s too far away.
By too far away I mean that
it’s ‘too far out. To be funny, a
person written about must relate
to the reader or to someone he
knows. Who do you relate, of
your acquaintanences with “The
Poet.” I relate none. He is a
non—existant character at Pitt.
The athlete is good. He does
exist and he certainly is doing
something characteristic. Th e
Van Doren bit is cool.,Another
spark. What is the point to hav-
ing the photographer standing

on his, head?.Just to be out of

 

place? —

of atdegree. It’s not believable.
Why must you be attached to
the paper? Why not‘ move your
rug from Schenley Hall ‘to the
Commons Room? Instead of dis-
cussing the “Importance of Im-
portance” discuss something that

is normal, average, a_nd interest-'
_'ing tothe average student. Ex-

ample: Is Pitt ‘going to buy the
Empire State Building and turn
it into dorms? (not at all unbe-

lievable at the present buying 4

rate). How about “Build a
Swimming Pool for the Pitt-
Club” or “Let’s Flood the

Ground Floor of the Cathedral?”

 Subsidization of

- Parties Blasted

Editor! the Pitt News.

Speaking as one who has been
a Pitt student for almost four
years, I feel that your editorial
on “Abolishing Political Parties”
has hit one of the most serious
problems confronting student

~ affairs.

Your views should be consid-
ered seriously by the members
of the Student Goyernment.
Assn. However, the important
issue at present is the fact that

ed’in the SGA_Constitution. ‘I-1.’
the members feel that they have
the right to allocate. student

‘money for political parties, I
/..feel 7that they are acting. irre-
sponsibly. '

Certainly, I think-- that the
person who presented such a

‘motion to’ SGA is not the kind

of individual who__ should bere-
presenting me or my fellow stu-
dents. ‘ " .

Poitical parties should be -able
to support themselves. Party
members should get outand sell
membership cards and ﬁndother.
ways ‘~ of raising money.’ The
main trouble with Pitt’s political
parties has been that they_func-
tion "only immediately " before
and during elections. There are
certain places that politics, are

not welcome, but there are many
others where political parties,
’ ' .can becomegboth active and use-

ful. , ,

If our political parties‘ con-
tinue to be run asthey are pre-
sently being run and their ac-
tivities remain as -limited as they
have been in the past, I believe

 it should be up to the individual
-student to-have no parts of them

and to form his own party, with

speciﬁc aims and purposes,‘-ore to

run independently for ‘ office.

coach Leo Bemis’ six year win-

But the Panthers accomplished
more than a win last Saturday,
for Goalie George Zanicopoulos

goalie in any season.

In ten games, Zanicopoulos per—_

“Zanicopoulos is better than any
goalie we have seen,” commented
Bemis. “An amazing fact is that
this is only the first season that

favorably by opposing coaches

time and a series of plays by each
team, neither team was able to
break the deadlock, and bath

seen on any of the players.

second and fourth quarters. Three
TDs were scored when Hawk

lateraled to Coach Ted Colton who

terback a. lot of protection, were
John Crock and Haggerty. Other
great players for the Hawks are
too numerous to mention.

Diamond Buying

1. CARAT WEIGHT
Diamonds are sold by weight, by the ‘,‘carat.” The carat measure
isdivided into a hundred parts, each‘ part called. a “point.” For
example, a ,50 Point diamond is half of a carat. However a
one carat diamond is worth more than two half carat stones.
This is because larger stones are scarccr than the smaller ones.

2. OUT
The degree of perfection achieved. ‘by the diamond “manu-
facturer” in cutting and polishing the rough stone has an im-
portant-‘ effect on brilliance of the stone and the value of the
ﬁnished diamond.

C

3. COLOR
Although a diamond reflects all the colors of a rainbow, a ﬁne
color diamond is clear, like a crystal-pure drop of water. The
more nearly it resembles this, the ﬁner it is in color. .

4. CLARITY
The clarity or degree of ﬂawlessncss, of a stone is an important
factor in determining value. Rarely is nature absolutely per-
fect. Therefore, in diamonds, the fewer and less important the
imperfections, the better the stone from this standpoint. Also,
most minor inclusions are not visible to the naked eye and have 1
little apparent effect upon the overall beauty of the diamond.

If there is 9. diamond in your future, we invite you to come
in and see our selection of modern rings, style-keyed to the taste
of young people. The price is right, and terms are available to
Pitt students.
