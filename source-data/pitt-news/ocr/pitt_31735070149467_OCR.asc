Sunts gather support for p

Youth vote important in upcoming presidential election’

By Gideon Bradshaw
For The Pitt News

When Texas Rep. Ron Paul an-
nounced in May 2011 that he was
running for president, Pitt stu-
dent Cliff Maloney hoped Paul’s
third time running would be the
charm.

Maloney, a junior education

.major at Pitt’s]ohnstown campus,

is the Pennsylvania campus coor-
dinator for Youth for Ron Paul.

I The national organization, which .

started last September, urges
young people such as students to
start local chapters in support of
Paul’s campaign.

Most of the Republican candi-
dates still in this year’s presidential
race announced their candidacies
in May or June of last year and
began unofficially campaigning

before then. President Barack
Obama officially declared he would
run in‘April of last year, although
he also began raising funds arid
campaigning well before then. As
the candidates kickedoff their
presidential bids, Pitt students
and recent graduates looked to
join the political arena to serve as
a valuable resource in capturing
youth votes.

Maloney, who began Volunteer-
ing with the organization last fall,
said that as of last Wednesday, the
organization had opened about
25 chapters nationwide toward
its 100—chapter goal. He said the
individual chapters use methods

such as canvassing, tabling and

phone calls to inform the public
of Paul’s message.

“Nu_mbers isthe big thing. You
want to have numbers,” Maloney
said, though he declined to go into

furtherldetail about the methods
the campaign would employ, say-
ing he could not speak officially for
Paul’s campaign. V

Casey Rankin, president of Pitt
College Republicans, said the club
will not begin campaigning for a
particular candidate until the party
ofﬁcially announces a nominee.
He expects this announcement
will come within the next few
months. ,

The club will encourage its
members to volunteer with‘ the
Republican campaign office in Al-
legheny County, canvassing and
working at the off1ce’s phone bank.

' Rankin said the club’s efforts to

reach voters will be especially
strong between September and
November.

“Most people tune in to the
elections and start paying atten-
tion after Labor Day,” Rankin said,

oliticians

adding that the club’s members

would be encouraged to put in ex- _

tra efforts during that time.

Lara Sullivan, the president of
Pitt College Democrats, is also the
regional director of ‘Students for
Barack Obama, a nationwide cam-
pus organization that began dur-
ing his 2008 campaign. Obama’s
campaign reorganized the group
lastjune. ’

Though Sullivan anticipates
her club will help Obama’s cam-
paign by making phone calls and
going door-to—door in the coming
months and during the fall, so far
its efforts have focused on voter
registration. She estimated that
the club registered about 100 new
voters last fall.

Former Utah Gov. Jon Hunts-

‘ man, who recently dropped out of

the race, began raising funds for his

Santorum’
nabs Iowa
in recount

Byjames Oliphant
Tribune Washington Bureau (MCT)

The ﬁnal certiﬁed vote tallies from

. the Iowa GOP caucuses show Rick; .
Santorum edging out Mitt "Romney -
by  votes, reversing the reported’ j 

order of ﬁnish two weeks ago, when
Romneywas said to have won by just
eight votes.

But there’s a big asterisk append-
ed to the result. Results from eight
of Iowa’s 1,774 precincts couldn’t be
certiﬁed, meaningthatthe true victor

inthecaucuses mightneverbeknown. ,

Santorum ﬁnishes with 29,839 Votes
and Romney with 29,805 votes. Ron
Paul came in third.   ] V

Still, politics is a binary system.
There has to be awinner and a loser,
so Santorum’s campaign is claiming
victory and moving on. “We know
we won Iowa,” said Santorum’s top
strategist, John Brabender, after the
results were released.

What it does mean is that Rom-
ney’s claim to have made history by

winning Iowa and New Hampshire .

back—to-back is outthe window. In a
statement, Ronmey called the result
a tie and acknowledged Santorum’s
“strong performance’?

‘ Santorum’s campaign is waiting
for a concessionary phone call from
Romney. “We’re goingto see ﬁrsthand
today what kind of character Mitt
Romney has,” Brabender said.

The certiﬁed result, he said, V

“makes the score one to one,” he said,
adding that Romney could no longer

claim he had won both states and im- .

ply that his nominationhis inevitable.
“It takes that entirely off the table.”

He said Santorum’s campaign
would be boosted by. Rick Perry’s
withdrawal from the race despite
reports. that Perry will endorse Gin-
grich. Santorum, he said, will now be
running against “one libertarian and
two moderatesf,’ ”

Both campaigns will be able to
inspect the documents originating
from each precinct in order to satisfy
themselves with the accuracy of the
results, the Iowa Republican party
said Thursday. ﬂ '

On Saturday morning, the Student
Government Board will pack into
two cars and travel 265 miles on
a day-long journey to formulate
plans to resolve issues facing Penn-
sylvania college students.

The Board’s destination is a
Pennsylvania Association of State-
Related Students conference at Lin-
coln University. Together with the
other state—related schools —~ Penn
State, Lincoln and Temple — the
student government leaders will
brainstorm methods to collaborate
in lobbying the state government
for more funding.

“I think that the opportunity
for all of us to get together and

   

4

coordinate our efforts is going to
be a great opportunity,” said Gov-
ernmental Relations chair Robert
Beecher, who will accompany the
Board on the trip.

PASS, which represents the
four state—related schools to the
state legislature on issues affect-
ing students, is comprised of stu-
dent governments from the four
state—related universities. Former
SGB President Molly Stieber, along
with representatives from the other
schools, co—founded the organiza-
tion in December 2010.

The representatives of PASS met
at Penn State last spring and Pitt in
the fall of 2011 and will travel to
Temple in the upcoming fall semes-
ter. At the previous meetings, the
representatives discussed the cuts

four universities will lobby at the

related universities instituted by
Gov. Tom Corbett.

At Tuesday night’s public meet-
ing, the Student Government
Board allocated itself $666.60 to
cover the costs of transportation
to this weekend’s conference. The
Board initially requested a budget
modiﬁcation of $934.44 topay for
hotel rooms and transportation.
The Allocations Committee recom-
mended that the Board approve
$467.22 to cover the costs of one

hotel room and transportation for ~

one vehicle.

In order to receive funding, stu-
dent organizations must submit a
request to the Allocations Commit-
tee, attend an allocations hearing
and send a representative to an.SGB
public meeting. A representative
from the group speaks ‘on behalf of
the request and SGB votes to either

   

 
 

approve, deny-or amend the Alloca-
tions’ recommendation.
Landreneau served as the stu-
dent organization representative
for the request, and Board member
Alex Murdoch amended the Alloca-
tions Committee’s initial recom-
mendation to fund two vehicles
forftransportation and no hotel
rooms, bringing the total request
to $666.60. , _
- Prior to the meeting, Lan-
dreneau sploke with SGB adviser

Kenyon Bonner about the request, .

and they decided to omit the hotel
roomstfrom the request and travel
to and from/Lincoln in one day.
The Board approved the amended
$666.60 request to cover the trans-
portation costs of two vehicles at
the standard mileage rate given to
student organizations.‘ m . _  11

their candidacies injune, though Bachmann
has since dropped out of the race. Former
Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney formed an
exploratory committee for his campaign the

the beginning of June. _

In recent decades, U.S.-presidential can- _

didates’ campaigns have begun earlier in

many of the candidates began their cam-

But Victor said she believes voters will
make up their minds before then, and so
prospective candidates have to get exposure
earlier in the race. This, Victor said, means
that during each election cycle, candidates
begin seeking mediaattention earlier.

Victor described the 2008 Democratic

primaries, when it did not become clear until -

earlyjune whether Obama or Hillary Clinton-
would be the party’s nominee.

During the same primary season, the Re-
publican party announced Arizona Sen. John
McCain as its nominee in March, well before
the conclusion of the primaries. Victor said
that it is much more typical to see the pri-
maries decided by March or April.

“In a number of years, by the Super Tues-

Super Tuesday, set for March 6 this year,

THE STAMATTACK

The limits of elite education

Insular Ivy League upbringings disadvantage our world leaders

By Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

Grab four or ﬁve of the smartest
people you know. Now build a
time machine. _

OK, you might not want to
grab them. Ask first.

Once you’ve made it back 15
years, place these people in the
same schools. Give them the
same life experience. Picka
town — Buffalo, maybe,
or someplace like that
—-— and encourage
them to remain '
mostly within
this nice little group
you’ve created.

What would the
world look like to
day if suddenly,
we handed them
the reins? They
would probably
be smarter;
without dis-
t r a c t i.o n s

highly spe-
cialized en-
vironment,
they’d reach
greater aca-
demic heights
and higher
levels of intel-
ligence. That
wouldn’t be bad.

But weiwould all _ 
probably want some 
variety. Even if our lead-
ers were the smartest people
alive, we would hope they expe-
rienced more than life in Buf-
falo. Having all emerged from
the same background, lived in the
same city, mingled in'the same
social groups and dealt with the
same problems, their under-
standing of the world would be
limited.

Unfortunately, this is already
the case with our best and bright-
est. However, instead of sticking
them in the same city as children,
we send them to the same uni-
versities —- Ivy League schools
and their academic equivalents
— and task them with control-
ling the world.

And control they do. A 2009

   
  
  
 

  

National Journal study found
that 37 percent of Obama’s top
officials held an undergradu-
ate or graduate degree from
an Ivy League school. The Su-
preme Court, for its part, is all
Ivy League. And 19 percent of
the current Senate holds a law,
undergraduate or graduate de-
gree from the Ivy League. Even

Wall Street is full of Ivy Leaguers: _

The Los Angeles Times reports
that some top schools send more

than a quarter of their classes
into financial services.

Unfortunately for the rest of ‘

us, relying solely on the intel-
ligence these esteemed lead-
ers presumably possess hasn’t
improved our condition. That’s
because management and lead-
ership aren’t really about intel-
ligence. Instead, they’re about
collaboration.

In other words, you get way
more out of two diverse people
working together than two peo-
ple being smart by themselves.

And although Ivy League schools

          
   
  
   
  
  
 
 
  
  
   
  
     
 

don’t typically produce antisocial
introverts, and many Ivies still
strive for diverse communities,
their average SAT scores shave off
all but the cream of the crop.

State schools like Pitt might
not be bastions of diversity, but
they still expose students to a
broader range of people. There
are more part-timers and non-
traditional students, and more
varying intelligences. If the melt-
ing pot dynamic is what gives this
country its vitality, the melting
pot of a state school is
‘ potentially just as
important.

Indeed, the les-
_ son we’ve learned

A from the past die-
cade is that ex-
perts are almost
’ always wrong
A anyway. Affirma-
; tions of this are
 everywhere: Re-
L member how
they assured
us Iraq har-
bored WMDs
or that sub-
 p_rime mort-
= gages had
to be sta-
ble? Now,
c r o w d —
sourcing is
in, and cen-
trally planned,
unaccountable or-
ganizations like the Eu-
ropean Union are out. Given
these developments, it seems
backwards that we still rely on
such a homogeneous (intellectu-
ally speaking) group to run the
country.

Ironically enough, an even
older model of governance is
better. Rather than the current
situation, where studies have
demonstrated that elite organi-
zations limit themselves to re-
cruiting only students from simi-
larly elite schools, a more varied
spectrum of backgrounds would
be preferable. For instance, only
15 percent of the 1955 senate held

degrees from Ivy League insti-

tutions, and m_ost of these were
law degrees acquired after many
years of working. The percentage

THE LYONS DEN

By Kel Lyons
Columnist

While dancing in a sea of intoxi-
cated college students at the Avicii
concert two weeks ago, a troubling
thought struck me: Opportunities
like this aren’t going to be around
forever.

Unfortunately, there are cer-
tain activities college students
shouldn’t take for granted. The
following is a list of behaviors we
can engage in only right now; to do
so as adults, after all, would all but

Savoring college misbehavior

Pregame  Well, Anything

The stereotype that college
students consume large quanti-
ties of alcohol is certainly not true
for everyone, but we all have that

throw down on a random Wednes-
day night just to celebrate hump

able to pound a couple of shots
on your way to church at age 30.
Only in college is it kosher to play
Thumper until 2 a.m. or consider
eight beers “taking it easy.” And
those late—night pizza runs after a
long night of fratting? Not as easy
to pull off when you have a wife to
sneak away from "or kids to put to
bed. Bonging a beer after you’re
25 issure to put you out of com-
mission and into bed for at least
three days.

Experiment

College is a great-time to take
classes outside of your major so
you can cultivate your interests
and hobbies. Regrettably, you don’t
have as much free time when you’re
older. There’s a reason golf is only
played during a few months of the
year and girls’ night is considered
a rare treat. Those lazy days when
you watch four hours of “America’s
Next Top Model” are numbered.
There comes a day in every adult’s
life when he has to put the Game-
Cube controller down, stop playing
“Super Smash Bros. Melee” tour-
naments and start focusing on his
career and family. And, oh, what a

sad day it will be.
Learn Things Differently

Tom Bodett once said, “In
school, you’re taught a lesson and
then given a test. In. life, you’re
given a test that teaches you a les-

-son.” Translation: The way you

learn things in the_real world is
totally different. One of the rea-
sons college is great is that we
can ensure, by studying, that we
know material well enough to pass
a course. We can therefore skip
every other class in an effort to
rank up in “Battleﬁeld 3,” and then
cram during the last two weeks
of the semester. Life after college
isn’t so forgiving; you’re forced to
learn things based on your mis-
takes. Those of you who bombed

biology and anatomy may have the 
advantage of knowing the pain of ’f

failure better than the more scien-
tiﬁcally competent.

Raves

Dayglow was created by and for
college kids, not older people with
jobs and responsibilities. Good
luck enjoying it when you’re older
and not blowing out your knee or
herniating a disc. For those of you
who attended (or remember at-
tending) the event, try and recall
if you saw anyone over the age of

30. Thankfully,'even if you’re the
most hardcore dubstepper, you’ll
probably soon cease to appreciate
loud Skrillex remixes and strang-
ers throwing gallons of blue paint
at your face. -

Riot

While rioting is never really
socially acceptable, recent devel-
opments at Penn State suggest it
happens more often when college
students are involved. It’s not
considered particularly normal
for non-college students to storm
major streets when the Steelers
win a Super Bowl or, more realisti-
cally, when Pittathletics suffers a
surprising loss. Lik_ewise, you don’t
often see older fans rush the court
orthe ﬁeld, during professional

.— sporting events, probably because

they’ll trip and ~get.,hu.t;t:.or throw

A "out theirbacks. 

. Hopefully this column has

V inspired you to capitalize on the

time you have left.at Pitt. Recog-

nize that the money you or your ’

parents pay contributes as much
to the famed college experience
as it does to your degree. Now if
you’ll excuse me, I’m going to see
if I can take out some more loans
for a ﬁfth year here.‘ I

Letters to the editor

To the Editor,

With regards to the Collegiate
Readership Program, a common
defense of the program’s suspen-
sion is that there is no way to know
how many students beneﬁt from
this $30,000 program, despite
over 99 percent of the papers be-
ing picked up. At this SGB’s ﬁrst
meeting, they allocated $1,980 for
a new -Taiko drum for Pittsburgh
Taiko. How many students will
beneﬁt from this drum? The an-
swer: It does not matter. Pittsburgh
Taiko and its members’ new drum
will bring-an immeasurable beneﬁt
to Pitt’s campus by offering diverse

. programming and activities to

campus. Similarly, the readership
programprovides an immeasur-
able academic and community ben-

eﬁt. Last semester, almost 41,000 I

students participated in Pitt Make
a Difference Day. This program was

a huge success and speaks to the
outstanding commitment Pitt -
and every institution of higher
education — has to foster civic
well—being and respect toward the
public good. Not a single student
publicly questioned how much of
his or her tuition went to paying
for PMADD, not even the ones who
chose not to participate. Like the
Collegiate Readership Program,
PMADD contributes to the civic
responsibility Pitt students should
foster on this campus. That is why
our commitment to the reader-
ship program must be renewed and
continued. When compared to the
more-than-$2,000,000 budget of
Student Allocations, $30,000 is a
small price to pay for the .-better-

ment of our campus;-ft-’.'»-::;.»;.r  .

To the Editor,

On last Friday’s paper, the front
page had a picture of the art from

' the art show currently being shown‘

-in Frick. Yet there was no article to:
go with it about the show or even
about who the artist was. The art-
ist’s name is Ashley Bowen and she,
along with several other artists,
had taken a trip to Wyoming with
a group of science students study-

ing geology, ecology-and paleon—. V
'tology, and their art represented

their experience on the trip. The
art they created was influenced
by the land and the fossils and was
remarkable.

I ﬁnd it frustrating that this
story wasn’t told in some sort of
article to accompany the picture.
There are pages of The Pitt News
devoted to editorials, opinions

and sports, but we couldn’t write
a column on an art show going on
right now? If a photographerwas
' going to be sent to cover the show
then why not also have ‘a reporter
cover the interestitig  _’j:b ' I’ been
art and science? {M " ' 
‘ers may n»otl'kno:w‘ab’out’th1s “art
show but would be interested. In
case you are wondering, the show
is still going on and, while readers

   

may miss out on the free food from .

the opening, I recommend they
check the other pieces out.

P.S..— It’s generally annoy-
ing to_ have a picture on the front

page that has nothing to do with.

the stories.

MEN’S BASKETBALL

Pitt still looking to end losing streak

The Panthers are 0-6 in the Big East and in last place in the standings.

Byjon Anzur
S taff Wri ter

Pitt and Louisville men’s basketball
teams started the season ranked
among the country’s top 10 teams,
but injuries and off-court issues
have derailed a promising season
for both.

Pitt (11—8, 0-6) won 11 of its ﬁrst
12 games, but a lack of experience
in the backcourt brought on by ju-
nior starting point guard Travon
Woodall’s groin injury — which has
sidelined him for 11 games —- and
the departure of freshman center
Khem Birch have sent head coach
Jamie Dixon’s team on an unprec-
edented descent.

Dixon said that having to play
athletes at different positions might
be one factor contributing to his
team’s offensive troubles.

That could change Saturday

_ night.

Woodall, ‘the team’s starting
point guard before his injury against
Duquesne on Nov. 30, participat-
ed in a full practice on Thursday.
He said that he will decide today
whether he feels healthy enough to
play Saturday against Louisville.

“When I_do come back, I want
to be 100 percent-— or at least 90
percent,” Woodall said. “I want to
be able to help my team, both de-

. In the story “Pitt club hockey poised for national bid,” The Pitt News incorrectly stated that club hockey goalie Rob Behling ﬁnished last season
 a .94 save percentage. Matt Schmidlin posted the .94 save percentage as Pitt’s goalie last season. The Pitt News regrets the error.

fensively and offensively.”

Pitt has had problems maintain-
ing possession of the ball this year,
especially in Woodall’s absence. The
Panthers are averaging 15 turnovers
per game in Big East play. Woodall
said that watching his team struggle
offensively has ‘only increased his
desire to return to the court.

“I’ve seen a lot of things that a
lot.of younger guys haven’t seen,”
he said. “I’ve been here for some
years now, so I’ve seen’ a bunch of
things. But it’s deﬁnitely made me
want to come back sooner.”

The prospect of playing against
a conference rival in front of a na-

tionally televised audience helps _

too, he said.

Typically, the presence of ESPN
College GameDay at a Pitt—Louisville
men’s basketball game makes sense.
Both teams are perennial power-
houses in the Big East, and their
meeting usually has implications
of what to expect in March.

But in a year where not much has
made sense for either team, Satur-
day night’s matchup between Pitt
and Louisville is more for pride than
an improved tournament seed.

Monday’s eight-point defeat at
top-ranked Syracuse marked the
Panthers’ seventh loss in as many
games and continued Pitt’s reign
as the only Big East team without
a conference win.

.,raphcr

r.

“Shooting is one [problem],”
Dixon said. “Anybody can ﬁgure
that out. Just look at the numbers.
At times it’s been shot selection, at
other times it been execution and
delivery of the ball.”

Pitt is shooting just under 46
percent from the ﬁeld this season,
but that number has been signiﬁ-
cantly lower during the last seven

1 games.

Like Pitt, Louisville hasn’t quite
lived up to preseason expectations.
After winning their ﬁrst 12 games,
the Cardinals (14-5, 2-4) have
dropped ﬁve of the last seven —
including a 90-59 defacing at the
hands of Providence.

Health issues have plagued the
Cardinals all year. In fact, eight
players have missed games this
season because of injury.

The most recent casualty came
in Monday’s loss to Marquette,
when junior forward Rakeem
Buckles suffered a torn ACL. The
injury will force him to miss the
rest of the season —— bad news for
an already-thin roster. Louisville’s
starting ﬁve accounted for 173 of

' the team’s 200 minutes against the

Golden Eagles.

But Dixon isn’t looking past
the Louisville players who are
healthy.

The Oakland Zoo 
prepares for GameDay

Byjasper Wilson &
Lauren Kirschman
Sports Staff

When ESPN announced that Col- "

lege GameDay would travel to the
Petersen Events Center this sea-
son, basketball fans expected to
be treated to a matchup between

' two Big East powerhouses.

They didn’t expect the game
to feature two teams at the bot-
tom of the conference standings,
but that’s exactly what they’ll get
when Pitt and Louisville tip off on
Saturday.

The Pitt men’s basketball team
is 10-8 overall, 0-6 in the Big East
and on a seven-game losing streak.
The Panthers, usually almost un-

. beatable at home, have lost four

games at the Petersen Events Cen-
ter this season. I

Louisville sits at 14-5 overall but
is 2-4 in the Big East. The Cardinals
have lost four out of their last six
games, including a 90-59 loss at
Providence onjan. 10.

Still, Pitt’s student section, the
Oakland Zoo, is doing its best to
make sure the Petersen Events
Center will be ﬁlled on Saturday.

Zoo vice president].D. Schroed-
er said that student tickets sold
out on Wednesday, but he doesn’t
know how many people will show
up for the show’s ﬁlming in the
morning.

“We’d obviously like to do bet-
ter than last time,” Schroeder said.
“We’ve been pushing [GameDay]
all week  We’re going to take
as many people as the Pete can
hold.”

The Petersen Events Center
will open at 6 a.m. and doors will
open at 8:30 p.m.. GameDay, and
the morning events are free for
everyone —— not just students. The
show will broadcast on ESPNU at
10 a.m. and ESPN at 11 a.m.

ESPN has included Pitt four

. times in the past for its College

GameDay broadcast, which offers
basketball analysis, news, features
and predictions on upcoming
games and is ﬁlmed in front of a
college’s fan base.

Pitt last hosted the show in
2007 when the Panthers defeat-
ed Georgetown 74-69. More than

3,000 fans attended the event
and formed the backdrop for th‘%§’-
broadcast.

Rece Davis, Jay Bilas, Hubert
Davis and Digger Phelps will host
GameDay this weekend while Dan
Shulman, Dick Vitale and Erin
Andrews will handle the game
broadcast.

With two teams that consis-
tently ranked at the top of the Big
East conference plummeting to
the bottom of the standings this
season, some students aren’t rush-
ing to ﬁnd a ticket. 3;"

Freshman Stephanie Schle-
busch —— who has attended a few
games this season — said the
team’s recent skid contributed
to her decision not to go to the
game.

“I have a lot of homework, and
I should probably do homework
instead of going to see them lose,”
she said.

Other students, like sopho-
more Chloe Steerman, said Pittls,
struggles won’t keep her out of the
Petersen Events Center.

“I’m all about school spirit,”
she said. “No matter what, I’m
there to support my team.”

Schroeder said that GameDay
gives students and fans a “chance

. to show off the University.”

“If it was just about the basket-
ball, they’d just show that,” he said.
“The reason GameDay came was
because of Pitt’s continued suc-
cess. They made the schedule 
August. It’s a reward for [Pitt’s]
continued performance and sup-
port. GameDay is a celebration of
everything about the University of
Pittsburgh and not just basketball.
It’s about showing off school pride
and who the team plays for.” V’?

Sophomores Tyler Kunsa and
Aaron Watson said they would go
to GameDay and Pitt’s matchup
with Louisville if they weren’t go-
ing to be out of town.

They added that although Pittfg,
slide has slightly hindered their
desires to go to games, they’ll con-
tinue to attend. _ ‘

‘‘It’s still Pitt,” Kunsa said. “It’s
still the Petersen Events Center.
They still play forjamie Dixon.”

Schroeder encouraged student?
to maintain their support for the
team.

Panthers hope to bounce back in

“ Byjasper Wilson
Stajfwri ter

The Pitt women’s basketball team is ready
to put its record-setting loss to No. 2 Notre
Qame behind it and focus on facing off
against West Virginia in the Backyard Brawl
on Saturday.
The Panthers (8-11, 0-6 Big East) suf-
fered their worst loss in history against the
Fighting Irish, falling 120-44, but Pitt will

 

  January 20, 2012 I The Pitt News I WWW.pittneWs.com

focus on the present when it tips off with the

Mountaineers (13—5, 3-2 Big East) at 2 p.m. '

Redshirt sophomore Abby Dowd will get
the chance to play in the rivalry game for
the ﬁrst time. _

“I think this game is gonna be about heart
for either team,” Dowd said. “Whoever wants
it more is going to win.

From the rest of the season here on out,
it’s about heart. It’s the Backyard Brawl. For
me this is extremely exciting. I remember
last year when the girls went to West Virginia

and beat them there. It was so big.”

Pitt head coach Agnus Berenato said that
Tuesday’s loss to the Fighting Irish was the
toughest game she’s coached. .

“I feel we’re really, really learning,” Ber-
enato said. “.[The players] didn’t get the win
because they don’t know how to get the win
yet. They have to experience it. This team is
a team that’s learning everyday.”

Pitt’s tipoff with West Virginia takes place
in the middle of ESPN College GameDay, and
the Panthers will also host Girl Scout Day.

Backyard Brawl  

But Berenato said she doesn’t want her
players to get distracted by external fac-'
tors. She wants them to focus on the task
at hand.

“Don’t get caught up in the hype,” she
said. “For us it’s about getting better. No
hype, no anything. It’s about us getting

‘ better. The main thing right now is. us and

getting better.”

Still, she added that she’s looking forward .

to the atmosphere the Girl Scouts and stu-
dents will create. , ' _

“I know we’re probably gonna have 1,200
to 1,500 Girl Scouts here,” Berenato said.
“I’m excited about that. Their tone  is ab-
solutely crazy and wonderful. They scream.
They yell. I’m excited.” _

Dowd said the team is focused on the
game. M ‘ ~—g I . , ~

“We have West Virginia on Saturday.
That’s what we need to focus on at this point,

and that’s what we’re focusing on more than

anything,” she said. ,

Dowd, who transferred from Buffalo, said
she didn’t really comprehend the intensity
of the rivalry before she arrived at Pitt. l

“I knew about it, but you don’t get it until
you really play,”she said. “You canunder-,
stand that it’s a big competition, but now
that [I’m] playing it’s just so much more
magniﬁed.”

Redshirt sophomore Ashlee Anderson.
said the Panthers needs to take the initiative

against the Mountaineers.

“One of the things the coaches stress to_
me is to be aggressive and stay aggressive on
offense,” Anderson said. “We have to play on
our game. DePaul was a running team. Our
best offense is transition. If we can push the
ball up and can get rebounds and push the
ball out, we’ll be successful.” y

' _Pitt lost at DePaul by just three points,
86-83.

Anderson, who is in her third year at
Pitt, said that she appreciates the meaning
of the Brawl. _ '

“You get pumped for that game because

it’s bragging rights because they’re right up 

the street basically,” she said. “You get a little
more pep in your step. You get ﬁred up.”

Pitt has the league’s worst defense —
allowing 71.3 points a game —— while West
Virginia has the second—best defense in the
Big East, giving up 49.5 points per game.

The Mountaineers also dominate when it
comes to rebounding, ranking second in the
Big East with 43.4 boards per game.

That statistic could spell trouble for the Y

Panthers, who collected just 17 rebounds’

, —— a program low — against Notre Dame

on Tuesday.
A duo of sophomore guards —e Taylor
Palmer and Christal Caldwell — leads the
way offensively for West Virginia. The two
average 13.7 and 10.1 points, respectively.

“I think [Pitt’s] just going through a rough
time,” he said. “We kind of have to just take
it in stride and try and help the team get
over the jump.”

He added that while he believes the Zoo
can play a role in performance, citing that
the players often mention that the student

section gives them the energy to pull off a big ‘

win, there’s only so much that fans can do.
“To be honest, sometimes a crowd pres-
ence can’t do everything,” he said. “We can’t
make layups or play defense.”
But Schroeder cited Florida State’s upset

ofthen—No. 3 North Carolina last week as an .

example of what can happen on GameDay if
the students get involved. _
“Have fun. Be wild. Go nuts,” he said. i

Junior Ayana Dunning averages 7.9 re-
bounds per game, "while junior center
Asya Bussie averages 6.6 boards and 12.6

Berenato said that she thinks establish-

ing the pace from the very beginning will be
particularly important to Pitt’s‘success.

“You have to come out, and you have to
be the aggressor,” Berenato said. “Someone’s
going to throw the [ﬁgurative] ﬁrst punch .. .

like we have to be conﬁdent, we have to take

Given the uncertain future of the Backyard , ;

join new conferences, Anderson said that
she wants to capitalize on the opportunity to
beat the Mountaineers one, if not two, more
times while she still has the chance.

have a limited bench,” Dixon said. “Their
depth is really something that stands out mo-
reso than that they have an injury or two.”

Redshirt sophomore Lamar Patterson
agreed. He said that his team has been prac-
ticing for things that have caused them trouble
against Louisville in the past —— especially the
ful1—court press. _ -

“We practiced being pressured, beating
it and attacking it instead of being tentative
against it,” he said.’ “That’s led to some of our
turnovers.”

Both Dixon and Patterson said that they
expect the home-court advantage to help as
well.

“I heard it’s going to be pretty loud in here
for College GameDay,” Patterson said. “The
crowd is a huge factor. We’re at home. We’re
going to protect our home court.” I
