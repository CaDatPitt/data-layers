D0 Wis Sta ff‘To Adopt
Civil War Orphan Tyke

Three prominent members of the dean_ of 'women’s staff
recently announced that they have contracted to adopt a
war orphan, left homeless during the recent bloody conﬂict.

Although the orphan has not arrived - yet, the “Big
Three” are. anxiously awaiting the arrival of their darling
little charge. They have completely renovated their home
in a Daffy Duck motif and prepared the walls of __the proposed
room for the orphan with gay? ‘ . * K ~-
woodland scenes, elves and lepre-
chauns, and just everything a child
would love.

Commenting on their proposed
new arrival, the ladies said: “We
can hardly wait for the patterof
little hobnail boots to echo through
our home.” The ladies gushed on
that they, were going to make the
orphan’s bed from a pillow from
the Syria-Lebonan Room, the mat-
tress will be a chunk of rock from
Lilly Court and the wrought iron
gate from the Commons Room ,

work for the bed.

Although reluctant to do so, the
charming ladies ﬁnally released
the name of their changedto the
Pitt Gnus. His full name is Stan— ’

tion from the “Three,” we learned‘

Dean of Men T. W. Biddle
announced yesterday through
red-rimmed eyes that a terri-
ble fate, had befallen the
bronze panther in his office.‘ “A
terrible fate has befallen the
bronze panther in my office”
he said. “Oh, horror of hor-V

out a mop. “What will I ever
tell the class of 1925?” ‘

It seems that the Panther
had accidently wandered out
of the dean’s oﬁice and into
the White Tuck Shop where
the poor little putty-cat was
run over by a passing steam-
roller.

SC Seeks Answer  

To Auto Industry

Shocked by the nearness of the baseball season at Forbes
Field and elections Apr. 7, the Student Council parking com’-
mittee has started the ball rolling so they won’t be counted
out when local politicians start pitching. .

In furious defensive argument that saw committee
chairman Stan Greenwaters pop. his bubble gum at least
three times, the committee defended its current stance in
the battle royal to get more park—¢

ing spaces for Rolls’ Royces, Auv-
ershanghavindoulogs, and H i 1 l
District jitneys. Greenwaters said:
“Progress is being hindered by
city fathers who don’t want to (1)
remove Schenley park, (2) paint
more white lines, (3) install
parking spaces on Forbes St. at
Bayard.” '

However, representative .Dick
de Trick, SC treasurer, felt that
the real reason for lack of re-
sponse from city fathers was the
great ﬁnancial boon that students
would contribute to the baseball
scene. Hemmed in, bumper to
bumper, and L:2i;'2.’a‘.«'; tr.»  the

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
   

city before 11:30 p.m. students
would drag themselves reluctantly
from the libraries, fine arts. dis-
plays, and Humanities society
meetings to attend the Forbes
Field contests (?)
Reporter Biased

Elucidating upon the treasurer’s

statements, Rhea Phillips who

,hadn’t spoken all year but has fol-'

lowed her calendar diligently up
to April, stood up tp speak. Smil-
ing at this reporter, the marriage
major said, “the principal reason
for students visiting the ball park
would be to satisfy an _insatiable
curiosity of the interior and ex-
terior motivations that lead per-
sons to view baseball.” Exhausted,
she sat down.

After three and a half hours of
constant discussion which was fea-
tured by ﬁfteen separate motions
and charges of incompetence, per-
sonal selﬁshness, idealism, and
eugenics council voted the follow-
ing proposal: “In view of the fact
that we have been misquoted,

misinterpreted, and missed" com,-'

pletely, we represent the students
at Pitt. Since we are elected by
Pitt students we wish to express

in most forceful terms the appar-

ent need for more parking facili-
ties within the university area.
But 0 backus up, we intend to
take a‘ vote of the student body to
determine whether there is really
a need for correcting the difficult
parking situation.”

  

Dr. ‘Balk eedles Stadens S .
‘Into Taking Anti-Polio Shots;

‘Downtown Beer Men’ Excluded

The Universitylof Pittsburgh’s‘Medical School announcedf‘, ’
today that further polio innoculationswould take place,as~

part of-the county-wide test for Dr. Ponas Balk’s anti—polio
serum. ‘

Selected for the extension of the innoculation experi-
ment were students from the University of Pittsburgh. Ask-

ed if the tests would be invalid because of the advanced age
f‘It is a known fact that thee ‘

mental age of University students
in the Pittsburgh area (including
Carnegie Tech, Duquesne -and Mt.
Mercy) is deﬁnitely in the ﬁve toa
seven year old bracket.”

A “Withthe injection of an anti-
hormone enzyme prior to the polio

‘serum innoéulation, the physical

age of these students should be
lowered considerably.”

Dr. Balk went on to say that
students from Duff’s Iron City Col-
lege, the Commercial Art Institute
of Pittsburgh and the Pittsburgh
Institute of Tonsorial Arts’ would

' not be included in the tests due to

a general. debility caused by drinki-
ing hard “downtown beer.”

He described “downtown beer”
as containing a high percentage
of alcohol, and minerals not con-
ducive to polio injections because
of the‘ proximity of the reservoir
to the river. , _ .

Students drinking “upriver wa-
ter beer” are most desirable for
the tests, Dr. Balk went on to say.

They are not to be confused with .
students who are “up the creekf’ ‘

he added- S .
‘ Queried as to

  

the part. the Pitt '

faculty would play in the innocu- '

lationxtests, Dr. Balk answered:
“We will not be ‘able to use any

member of‘the Universi_ty’s fac-
ulty in these tests since most of-

them have been paralyzed too-long
to be of anyuse scientiﬁcally.” ~
He said that no tests would be

made on students who were al-

ready paralyzed at. the Greeks. '

In keeping with the expanded¢ -

Roofus R. Fizzgerald announced
several minor and one major ac-
quisitions to the Pitt campus.

At a formal banquet attended

George the elevator operator held
at Scotty’s Diner, the chancellor
announced that the Pittsburgh
Athletic Association, the Masonic
Temple, and the Syria Mosque
were purchased as minor additions
to the campus.

However, the Chancellor was
greeted by prolonged and thun-
dering applause, mingled .with a
few rowdy shouts and cat calls,‘
when he made known the biggest

and glorious history, Beto’s Pizza
Palace. 

Said Chancellor Fizzgerald,
“The reason we were so keen on
Beto’s is that they,serve the best
pizza in town.”

Besides serving as as student
center the pizza palace will also be
used as a Home Economics lab-
oratory.

Ramblett, director ‘of the Univer-

nounced that for the first time
since their opening the Tuck
Shops and the cafeteria will serve
coffee. A

The announcement came as a
result of several threatening let-
ters supposedly sent to Miss Ram-
blett by Pitt students, who refus-

ed to drink the lysol now being
served at Pitt’s elaborate eateries.

The price for the new beverage
will be $1.85, because as Miss

to work unless their pay is raised

The ‘insidious forces that are forever at work under-

freedoms are showing‘/their ugly and despicableheads more
boldly than ever before at Pitt. A vociferous minority of
antagonistic, rabble-rousing pseudo-students is plugging for

These propaganda-wise gangsters would have us be-

that this is not the ideal spot to meet our friends, to enjoy

cious, and well—_ve.ntilated Tuck Shops, of -which there are
two, and dare to suggestrin insufferable and ridiculous terms
that these, also, are not adequate for students needs. Yet
they are here in our midst: these crack-pot visionaries with

losses and a tie, Mitterling remains

Since so many Panther gridders¢

have classes past the 4:30 starting
time. of afternoon practice on Tues-
days and Fridays, no workouts are
scheduled on these days. Instead,
D_awson.said an extra‘ session will
be held Saturday mornings to
make up the deﬁcit.

Two A Transfers

The Redhead explained that the A

unique situation occurs “because
we’re getting better students, espe-
cially more pre-meds, engineers,
and the like, and they have late
classes and labs.” ‘

Even with this new obstruction,
though, m o r e
than 60 candi-
dates are out to
g ai n positions
on the’ squad.
This includes 18
.1 e t t errnen, 22
highly-regarded
freshmen, tw o .
transfers from
Maryland, and
a returnee from
the Army.

Bill Amos, a
quarterback from Washington, and
Jim Dalrymple, a 240-pound tackle
from Schenley, are the gifts from
the Terrapins while Walt Bielick,
an end of several years ago, also
tries out. ‘ _ ‘

“Staff Not Large” I

Amos joins the most spirited bat-
tle for a starting jdb, that of quar-
terback. Returning from last cam-
paign are Henry Ford, Pete Neft,
and Rudy Mattioli, plus frosh Cor-
nelius Salvaterra, Darrell ' Lewis,
"and Jim Lenhart. Dawson indi-
cated that all will get a chance at
signalcalling and also at the other

' backﬁeld positions.  1

The two pitchers who will prob-

Shanafelt. Last year Miller com-
piled a record of three wins against
one loss, while Shanafelt has a
two-year record of ﬁve wins and
three losses. Last year’s ace, Dick
Shannon, is ineligible because he
had to accept his degree in order

E Scrimmage Today

Monday’s ﬁrst day was used for
the usual conditioning exercises in
addition to blocking drills. This
afternoon, however, scrimmages
are due to begin as there are only
20 days of practice Within a 30-
day period allotted by the NCAA
for spring practice. A

With a look at the 1954 schedule
and also at the talent out on the
ﬁeld, this is hardly enough time to
pare the team down to its best
eleven, so Dawson will most likely
experiment with some new com-

Many coaches and fans noted
that referees had become increas-
ingly annoying in recent years,
ever since the advent of television,
to be exact.

The committee explained that,
to compensate for the absence of
ofﬁcials fromvnow on, players and
coaches will be on their honor to
conduct the game within the
rules. It felt that all schools will
respond with the same cooperation
they gave to the no-recruiting
rule and the. outlawing of injury-
faking.

Coaches to Stay

tacted did not seem to mind being

ment, “and Russian like fools. ‘The

program as we saw it had too
many holes in it; anyway, it’s noth-
ing to blow your top about.”

Another issue of the rules ses-
sion met with stiffer opposition. A
move to outlaw coaching was de-
feated by a slim vote, after pres-
sure from the Cannon Towel peo-
ple was applied.

Tomorrow the sessions continue
with the possibility of a regulation

“FLASH” enowws
TWO-HEADED 
BROTHER 

 
 
  

A certain Sophomore named Brown acquired the
appellation "Flash,” not because he was lightning on the-
gridiron, but just because he was never without an answer.

You’d pass him on the quadrangle and say “Howls it goin’,
Flash?” He’d answer, “Air Express." Get the pitch?

Brown often referred to his “two-headed brother” in
conversations. One day afew men in his fraternity were
needling him. .

"Your brother’s two heads must present quite a few problems.‘
"Not really. The only problem was-"his neatncss,” said Flash.

“Neatness?” “Yes,” answered Flash, “he worried about it.
Said he couldn't ﬁnd a shirt that didn't wrinkle around the
collar. You see, he was often looking in two directions

at once, or eating and talking on the telephone.

Hard on a collar.”

"What did you do?" They Vknew he did something about it.

A "Simple. I gothim the Van Heusen Century shirt with the
exclusive soft collar that won.’ t wrinkle ever! I got him
different ‘collar styles and colors. $3.95 for the white,
$4.95 for the colors and superﬁne whites. You should have
seen the grins on his faces when he saw how -those collars
stayed neat ‘all day and night without starch or stays.”

“I guess -he can really hold his heads up now,” said one.‘

“Yep. He ﬁgures he gets four times more wear from Century
than from other shirts. Of course, he actually only gets twice
the wear. He just ﬁgures. in- both heads.” .

it was all true. A ' -

Dumhells Denounced:
Dean Electrifies Tramps

At a Parent Teachers meeting
held in the Peasant’s Room of the
Cathedral of Learning,_ Bean of
Men T. W. Diddle announced that
the main cause for students ﬂunk-
ing out of school is their failure to
pass courses.

The revelation came as a shock
to the crowd, which might be call-
ed the most undistinguished. ever
to assemble here.

Bean Diddle said that something
must be done to stop this “shame-
ful waste of talent.” He proposed
lowering the University’s already
rock bottom standards. ‘

As he skillfully dodged over-

ripe tomatoes and cabbages the
Bean continued with his poorly
prepared speech.

“Students refuse to hand in as-
signments and when they do, the
work is sloppy,” he remarked. He
then reminded the throng that Pa-
per Mate Pens are smear-proof
and urged them to run to ‘Sun for
all their drug store needs.

Another reason for the failure of

students to pass is tired blood.
“There is only one cure for that”,
he said. “You know it as well as I,
Geritol, spelled backwards its
Lotireg.” ..

A cafeteria worker provided

The worker, who asked to re-

“Although we are a non-proﬁt

with a smile. “And after all,” she
added, “we are here to give stu-
