No competition lei

by PAUL SYMCZAK

A general uncertainty regarding candidacy re-
quirements has delayed the ‘Men's Dorm Council

elections.

According to Andy Solomon, chairman of the
‘ MDC Elections Committee, the elections scheduled

 MDC elections delayed

stated, “The elections haven’t been postponed;

there was no need to hold any with only one candi-
date for each office. If no one else turned in peti-
tions, they (Spadafore, Tolner, and Morgan) almost

have to be named as officers. There's really no

candidate for each of the three of-
fices to be filled submitted the
necessary signed petitions.

Consequen‘tly, JoAnn Woodson.
assistant director of Housing, de-
cided to meet with each of the
candidates, Scott Spadafore, Dav-
id Tolner, and Reid Morgan, be-
fore deciding if they should as-
sume office immediately or re-
schedule the election.

“It’s too bad that we didn’t get
more candidates,” stated Wood-
son, “but until I’ve talked to the
three people who submitted peti-
tions, no other information can be
given out about the elections.”

There is some additional con-
fusion about the present resi-
dence of one of the candidates, be-
cause his name is not listed on the
Housing Office roster, and the

candidate cannot be reached for comment or ques-

tions.

According to Woodson, since dorm residence
is a prerequisite for running for a MDC office. the
- eligibility of the candidate must be determined be-
fore he can be declared the winner of this election.

other choice in the matter.

“If'someone’s not eligible,

- though, then I guess we’ll have to

open the elections again,” Kren-
icky added.

Krenicky noted that officers
must be named in order to sub-
mit an already overdue MDC alw-
location request for next year.

The suggested reason for the
lack of interest is as confused as
the elections themselves.

"Some people took petitions,"
stated Krenicky, "but they did-
n’t return them because they said
their schedule was too full next
year ‘ '

“The elections were publicized
as much this year as any year.
There were announcements in
the Pitt News and all the MDC
senators were notified. I guess no

one wanted the responsibility,” Krenicky said.

“Maybe it will take an article or an editorial in
the Pitt News to let people know what a good posi-
tion MDC president is, and how many things he gets
involved in as a campus leader,” Krenicky con-

Parking tags protested

by RICH EULER

It seems that the people who
have been receiving tickets for

' parking in front of Trees Hall this

term aren't the only ones asking
"Why?"

Both Paul Popovich of the Uni-
versity’s Physical Plant and Jim
Balser of the City Traffic Plan-

. ning Department had no know-

ledge of the situation and seemed
quite baffled when the circum-
stances were explained to them.

The area in question is a section
of Allequippa St. between the
campusbus stopin front of Trees
Hall and the driveway of the Trees
Hall parking lot. Until this year.
the stop had been marked by a
"No Parking Anytime" sign with

 "Campus Bus Stop“ sign ap-

pended to it. The restricted zone

; was marked by a blue curb.

my‘
:'.l\

 

     

This year, however, although
the “No Parking” sign and blue
curb remain, the appended “Bus
Stop” sign has disappeared, and

.; city police,have been tagging the
.;entire area, rather than merely

those vehicles parked on the blue
V line.

Explained a city policeman as
he wrote out a ticket “that sign
(the one in front of 'l‘rees Hall)

'-prohibits parking from there to-

the corner of the parking lot drive-
way.

Officer Lancaster of the cam-

 pus police. however. was some-
what surprised to hear this. "'1 al- ‘
aways understood that parking was g

 

     

permitted up to the campus bus
stop,” he said.

Apparently, that is the way
most people understand the situa-
tion also, since the free spaces in
front of the Hall are always filled
by 7:30 a.m. Nonetheless, appro-
ximately once every two or three
weeks, the drivers have return-
ed to their cars to find a ticket re-
quiring a court appearance or $10
fine. The tagging has usually oc-'
curred in the evening.

Said Popovich, “If parking is
prohibited in that area, then,there
should be a sign on the lamp post
at the corner of the driveway.

"Of course, the tickets may
have been given out by some city
police who were unfamiliar with
the area and didn‘t understand the
situation," he added.

Popovich also stated, that he did
not recall ever requesting, that
_the‘Campus Bus Stop sign be tak-
-en down.

Ken Sorgel of the Facilities
Maintenance Department sup-
ported Popovich. “Weve receiv-
ed no such request in the past
year." Sorgel reported. '

Neither Popovich nor Sorgel.
however. were ruling out the pos-
sibility of vandalism.

Both Popovich and Balser said -
they will investigate. the situation»

as soon as possible.

""We may have an answer to
the problem by the middle of next
week,” Balser said.

In the meantime, those com-
muters who utilize the free park-
ing available in the area will still
run the risk of havingto pay a $10
fine for the privilege if their tim-
ing is bad.

Credit base change

proposed for College

by SHARON SEXTON

At a recent meeting of the College of Arts and Sciences Council,
council member Peter Karsten presented a proposal that the credit
base in CAS be shifted from three to four credits. '

This would mean that a CAS student who normally takes five
courses per term, or 15 credits, would be required to take four courses '

per term, or 16 credits.

Karsten sees the advantages of such a change as twofold.
Provided, that departments continue to offer the same number of

courses, class size would be reduced. In addition, students would have
the opportunity for more advanced and concentrated study. '

The proposal met with a favorable reaction from council members. , 
Gail Hornstein, student representative on the Council, called the 

proposal a “superior idea.”

Giving her justification for the change Hornstein said, “After the
end of each term I look back and think, ‘If only I hadn’t had to direct
my energies in five different channels,I would have absorbed so much

3))

more.

Several Council members agreed that an additional advantage to
the change would be the revision of curriculum necessitated as each
professor decides the differences in terms of work load between three

and four credits.

Several disadvantages were also brought up by the Council mem-
bers, as they pointed out the changes would cause conflicts with other
schools outside CAS, such as the Nursing School, where students adhere
to a rigid three credit base block schedule. The proposal could also pre-
sent major problems in room scheduling.

Dean Jerome Schneewind, head of the Council, suggested that the '

 
 

proposal be entered as an agenda item for the first Faculty of Arts and I ,5 5.‘ 

Sciences meeting in the early fall.

In the meantime, an informal investigation of other schools with a . _
four credit base and a term calendar will be conducted. 

The proposal by the Mathematics and Philosophy Departments for
a joint program in Mathematics and Philosophy was approved by the ’

Council.

The program is designed for those students interested in symbolic ‘
logic whowant to explore itzin conjunction with mathematics on.a high-

er level.

d I ‘Lars Bolin, as part of a panel
‘discussion on the training of pris-

dial staff) and counselors (treat-
ment staff) are separate entities
in our prison system.”

Tom Carter, from the State Bu-
reau of’Corrections, replied that
the. training for guards, while
“not what it should be, it is get-
ting better.” Several years ago a
guard only went for three weeks
training, now it is nine.”

Moving on to the topic ofa phil-
osophy of corrections, Sol Horo-
witz of the Political Science De-
partment said that "the problem
is that we are not sure what we
expect from our correctional sys-
tem. There is no agreement. even
among academicians, about what
we expect a correctional system
to accomplish.” '

Tom Carter echoed Horowitz’
sentiments, noting that “the pub-
lie is unsure of their attitudes to-
wards corrections, and correc-
tions is not separate from socie-
ty, it is just a product of that so-
ciety.” .

Karns said thatSweden‘s homo-
geneous society does not have
that problem. Bolin pointed out

that "to us imprisonment itself is ’

punishment. We do not believe
that a man should be sent to pris-
on to be punished, but rehabili-
tated. Deprivation of freedom is

punishment enough for us-. That is

why we have furloughs, allow
conjugal visits and _ generally
stress resocialization.”

“For us it is not only a ques-
tion of rehabilitation but also of
preventing the injurious effects
of prison,” stated Bolin. He add-

Publications heads . (mno unccd

by DAVE" BLUEY

The Office of Student Publications announced
Wednesday the names of students to head various
student publications in the upcoming year". -

Gary Spicuzza has been named. editor of the.

1973 Owl. He intends to keep the yearbook similar
to the 1972'edition, again including all campus or-

. ganizations. But Spicuzza plans to share responsi-

bility with his section editors.
"I want to make it fairly large," he added.
“with no wild effects.”
The business manager will be Lisa Kronenfeld.
Kronenfeld had not yet decided what she will
do with the business end, but has set a goal of over

3,000 sales. This would represent an improvement
over.this year's total of 2,500.

e ‘.'I see the Polaris as a magazine for new peop-
ple and not a literary publication,",said7 Robin Ro-
goff, the new editor of the freshman guidebook.

'Rogoff contended that the book should contain

explanations of the course innovations that Pitt of- a

fers, such as the ‘Freshman Studies and Black
Studies programs, and give incoming freshmen an
idea of the activities in which they can participate.

to improve the business end by possibly initiating
an advertising section.
" "This added revenue could make upfor a defi-

cit incurred by poor sales and improve the content"

of the book," he said.

“The magazine has room for controversial ‘»is- 7 ‘

ed, “but, they still must pertain to the fieldof engi-

One method of prison reform
cited by Lars Bolin. director of
Personnel Training of the Swedish
National Correctional Adminis-
tration, is to cut down the number
of people in prison by reducing
the number of crimes.

In a speech here Friday. he ad-
mitted, ‘_‘I don‘t like prisons at
all. They should be reserved for

= necessary and dangerous cases.”

Reluctant to offer suggestions

‘ for American prisons, Bolin said

it is impossible to adopt another
country’s system due to different
cultures and other factors. "I
have my problems and you have
yours,” he said. -

“My most shocking experience,”

Bolin said of his visit to Western
Penitentiary, “was seeingi500 in-

. mates in the same unit.” The pris-
on has three times as many in- '

mates as the largest prison in
Sweden, he said.

Bolin observed that "Inmates
who had broken the regulations
inside the prison were sent to this
cell (Solitary confinement). in
some cases for one year. They
were forbidden to work. I don’t

understand why," He labeled this

practice ‘shocking?’ also.

According to Swedish law. "an
individual in prison should be
treated with respect for his hu-
man dignity," Bolin said.

Bolin spoke of the existence of
a prison hierarchy, with rehabili-
tation of inmates at the bottom.
The prison system, he said, is
built for other purposes, and re-
habilitation is largely ignored.
“How can you use group therapy
when you have ?500» people?” he
asked.

Bolin described the criminal
justice system as a chain with dif-

ferent links: legislative, judicial.)

and correctional, among others.
"If you concentrate on prison re-
form, you concentrate only on the
last link," he said.

The other links oflthe chain
have not been overlooked in

‘Sweden, Bolin said. A law now be-

fore the Parliament would send
convicted drunken drivers to al-
ternative institutions. Sweden‘s

‘prison population of 5,000 would

almost be eutin half, he said. (Ex-
cept for capital crimes, drunken
driving carries the stiffest pen-

alty, and is considered the most
dangerous crime in Sweden.)

The roots of crime are in so-
ciety itself, and cannot be con-
trolled by the criminal justice
system, Bolin said. The smallest
portion of crime is the “blue-col-
lar” type, involving the poor man
in the street, while the “white-col-

lar”‘ version accounts for the

great '-majority of crime.

"Why aren‘t we discussing
‘white-collar‘ crime? Why are
we so intensely interested in such
a small part_of crime?“ Bolin
asked, and then gave an example
of "white-collar crime in the
United States. ‘

After talking with Ramsey Clark
and others, Bolin learned that
U.S. pharmaceutical companies
produce enormous amounts of
drugs, only one-third of which
reach the consumer for medical

use. The other two-thirds are on_

the black market. with ‘sales run-
ning into billions of dollars an-
nually, he said.

“I have heard that a lot of this
money goes back to election cam-
paigns. That’s corruption,” Bolin
said. “In Sweden, we don’t have

a mixed capitalistic-socialistic
state. It’s difficult to hide mon-
ey.’7 '

“Many of the crimes in urban-
ized and technologically advanced
areas are connected with drug ad-
dicts and alcoholics," he added.

Bolin was asked why there are
so few women in Swedish prisons. '

“ (Because) we are gentlemen,”
he- answered, “especially the
judges. Also because ‘private
crimes’ such as homosexuality,
prostitution, and abortion are not
crimes.

Asked if Sweden had political
prisoners, Bolin replied, “Yes. we
have one spy.“

“The human life is not a static
one. its dynamic." he concluded.
"There are some injurious ef-
fects to losing freedoms. We try
to prevent these effects."

Above the fresh ruffles of the surf
Bright striped urchins flay each other with sand.

Hart Crane, Voyages

Amid uncritical nostalgia, a legend flourishes.
The little old lady is alive and well and hawking used
cars in Pasadena. Yet what, praytell, of Jan and
Dean, those engaging warblers of summery falsetto
harmonies, playing Avis to the Beach Boys’ Hertz
when the latter were “gonna shutyou down?"

Sundry rumors spread after an auto crash in-
definitely crippled Jan Berry’s (and hence the
duo’s) chart-busting career. Jan languished as a hu-

man vegetable, wailed the pessimists. Later still.
a few semi-optimists argued that Berry was serv-
 ing tables on the West Coast. And Dean Torrance.
’ » both agreed, formed Kittyhawk Graphics, designers
of—among others—The Turtles’ Golden Hits disc
_j_ jacket. '
But 10 and behold, what to the wandering eye

has appeared but the United Artists Legendary
Masters Series, featuring—yes!——The» Jan and Dean

   
   

liner notes/reminiscences, Jan’s condition is pro-
gressing favorably. And, wonder of wonders, a pa-
per reported recently that Mr. Berry is back in the
' ‘ studios. Surely some revelation is at hand!

Meanwhile, see the boys of summer . . . in their
—ruin? Won’t come back from Dead Man’s Curve,
huh? Ah,’ sweet memories of youth! Return with us
now to those thrilling plays of yesteryear: Jan and
Dean ride again!
And ride indeed they did: the wild surf, skate-
boards, and, of course, a ’34 wagon that they call a
_ , "Woody.” A clean," fresh wash of sound pouring out
 ‘ through the airwaves. California’s striped urchins
‘ probably sprinkled about as much sheer delight as
any act in rock annals. And in the process rung up
over nine million sales!

 True masters of the put-on and double take, Jan
, '  and Dean were aptly tagged the Laurel and Hardyof
 ,-_._r;.~,; rock ‘n’ roll. Actual mini-skits slipped into a few

fact, at the height of the Batman craze, a disc titled .

1  Pitt composer sltaires philosophy A

 by ANDREW J . SOPKO
:'~':s Arts Editor ‘

As "new music” month runs its course, our
Music Department continues to gain more and more

of a reputation as a center for the contemporary 1

idiom. New music necessitates new composers
(and vice versa), and the department’s group of se-
rious composers is certainly expanding. Among the
newest additions to the Pitt Composer's Forum’ is
- John Celona, an individual who has had no less than
 four of his own compositions performed public.ly
A" since his arrival in Pittsburgh last year.

, V , A graduate of San Francisco State College, Ce-
‘ If lona has chosen composition as his chief concern

and is quite intent upon being a good composer; he.

‘ admits unabashedly that the goal of his work is “to
 be the best composer in the world."

"You should write every piece as if it were
your last” seems to be his principal philosophy, and
he has worked hard to live up to it. Not only have
many of his works been well received but he has re-
ceived commissions as well. “A sense of commit-

A ment must underlie a composer's work. Without
 unfailing commitment, one can never be a good
 , C°mP0S€|‘,".he said.

Celona’s chief interest is sound phenomena, a
fact explaining his many hours spent synthesizing
sounds on an electronic music system. As a result,
electronic tape plays a large part in all his composi-
tions. However, this preoccupation with phenom-
ena does not mean that he has thrown all the other
musical rules out the window. “I am what you would
call a ‘form conscious’ individual; a bunch of ran-
dom sounds certainly cannot be called music, and

 ;_ i_my works do not reflect this random method,” he
says. Each of Celona’s works isaccompanied by a
yery carefully drawn out “plan” (one such‘ “plan".

"'4 is actually selling as an art poster in“California),
“ ~.so metimes drawing on visual media.

  

 

As early as 1959 the J&D humor craved expos-,

  

Dragsters, nostalgia clash

“I am only five’ years old/And my baby's three/
But I know that she's a girl/Just you wait and see/
When I say I love my girl/She replies to me,

. yeah:/Um da, um da, um da da/Um da, um da—da

Anthology Album! According to Dean's copious -. _

   

da/Um da, um da, um da da/Um da, um da da/
Which means to say :she loves me—— / In baby talk.”
Ahem. They’ don't write "em like that anymore
(perhaps fortunately so). Actually. neither of the
twosome penned "Baby Talk.“ But the lyrics click-
ed—-the twinkle in the eye caught on. And the duo
survived to, in Dean‘s words, sing "about things

that were never sung about before and probably

will never, ever, be sung about again."

A substantial section of this collection docu-
ments a particular lifestyle of a peculiar commun-
ity, by a couple of witty fellas with plenty of pluck.
Few artists would have been nervy (or stupid?)
enough to release absurdities resembling "Schlock
Rod," "The Submarine Races," or even "Surfin'
Hearse’! “I got a 1937 Cadillac hearse)It’s not
too cheery, but it could be worse."

Alas, each of that curious triad is absent here.
But the humor is not. Jan and Dean churned out a
series of remarkably varied subtle satirical com-
ments on the entire surf/hot rod mystique. Not
consciously kidding at first, until the tune Dean
lauded as the breakthrough. It’s all here, gang, and
entitled “Dead Man’s Curve.”

It’s still got a decent beat, by golly. An‘ ya kin
even dance ta it. Honest, guys ‘n’ gals. But a hush
crept over listeners as the yarn reached its stunned
climax: a dramatic harp. intruded. "Well, the last
thing I remember, doc, I started to swerve." An-
other tension-building outburst. "And then I saw the
Jag slideinto the curve.” D1un! "I know I’ll never
forget that horrible sight—" Dlunn! "I guess I
found out for myself that everyone was right . . .”

And then the potency of the message really hit:
“Won’t Come BaekFrom Dead Man’s Curve!” The
warning ringing in one’s ears, again and again. But
Jan and Dean did return, and an awful lotta folks
are glad they did.

That little old lady with the brand-new, shiny
red, super stock Dodge, for instance. She’s here.

_And so is the memorable chorus from rollin’ “Side-

walk Surfini" But vour buns, bust your buns.”
Not to mention a cut with the catchiest title ever,
“The Anaheim, Azusa and Cucamonga Sewing Cir-
cle, Book Review, and Timing Association,” de-
scribed by Dean as “a certain Bach Chorale linked
quite smoothly with ‘I Get Around.”

/‘

To date, Celona’s most ambitious work is prob-

, ably Response, a choral work employing two choirs,

organ, electronic tape, and percussion. Many will
probably remember its premiere last December by
the Heinz Chapel Choir when the fortissilmostsound
ever. to shake the chapel’s hallowed walls was

heard. In Response, the composer has attempted ‘

to imitate the sounds of bells vocally, electronical-
ly, and percussively.

Underlying Response is another important part
of Celona’s musical philosophy: the idea of enjoy-
ment in performance. "If the performer does not
have a good time in performing a work, the work’s
entire nature may well be lost,” he explained. In
Response, the vocalistswere carefully instructed on

the joyous aspect of ‘ the piece, also receiving the'

opportunity to play their own percussion instru-
ments, thus adding to the joyful tumult.

While Celona admits that he owes much‘ to the
modern Polish school of composition (especially
Pendereckl) in his work, he confesses that he is
“open to all music.” He has interests in not only
jazz but rock as well. His eclecticism is further ex-
tended by an interest in the music of the Italian
baroque.

\

In his youth, Celona always knew that his work -

would be musically oriented, but he did not see the
role of composer in his future. The saxophone was
really his first love and he hoped to devote his ca-
reer to that instrument. Facing up to reality. he
realized that there was really no future purely as
an instrumentalist and so the compostion paper
was brought out and the sax put away for the most
part (I’m told that hestill gets quite a few wild
sounds out of it, however). And so John Celona
evolved from instrumentalist to composer, and evi-
dently continues to evolve—espe_cially as far as

,thescaleof his works is concerned. At this very mo-
ment, he even has.p1ans for an opera. ' ‘

JAN AND DEAN: “Bust your buns.”

One minor classicmany may be hearing for the first time is naugh-
tily marked as "One Piece Topless Bathing Suit," starring a 94 year
old granny "in her one piece topless bathing suit) In Boston she'd be
banned/In her one piece topless bathing suit,She‘s the coolest girl in
the sand."

Cool in another sense is the bouncy "Popsicle," boasting a clever-
ly rendered, .“so when you hear the bell go ‘ding a ling,"‘phrased so en-
gagingly as to prevent the whitholdal of laughter. And, of course, the
foot stompin’ four on the floor flashes stand out, too: "Drag City."
"Surf City,” and "Honolulu Lulu,” among others.

Similar formulas employed throughout the golden era? To a cer-
tain degree, perhaps. But underlying the quips rode the rock ‘n’ rollin’
beat. And that’s what it’s all about, isn’t it?

Sure, as the surf/hot rod fads faltered, chart success dimmed
slightly. But whether hitchin’ rides in wetsuits or cruising high and
dry, the whimisicality inevitably surfaced. There was so much humor,
in fact, that it intermittently leaked out onto the covers—perhaps most
hilariously on Golden Hits Volume Two, destined for a niche in the lin-

.er note Hall of Fame.

And when Jan and Dean chose to“protest rock"with parodies includ-
ing "The Universal Coward” and “Folk City” (sigh, both excluded
here), an album of Folk ‘n’ Roll was graced with these words of wisdom.

-- .'.K-__',-~.~L. ‘
_ Yd ,_,» '}_‘_,‘.~._‘q. _;~_~<".: ‘V.

on its reverse (any spelling errors were intentional): "Join the Jan and 3;,

Dean protest train movement. Here’s what you canldo. Go find-sum

A ‘railroad tracks and sit on them like you see‘ us do-, as illustrate above; If

you are a Beachboy fan, sit on tracks only at night.”

Dean’s notes on the Anthology are somewhat more serious—but the
wit still pushes through here and there in anexcellent commentary.
And Dave Marsh's critical analysis is commendably coherent. Though
the ablum is irrelevantly flawed—a “live” side fails to capture the
real Jan and Dean flavor-a quick remedy is to purchase a copy of Com-
mand Performance: Jan and Dean/Live in Person. The in-between
banter pays for itself in smiles. And the music is basically first-rate.

But if you prefer a nice, neat little package, this is it’: The Jan and
Dean Anthology. All the above cuts, except those specifically indicated
as among the missing. And plenty more, notably “Heart and Soul” and
"Linda,” in this deluxe set.

First it- was"‘two girls for every boy,” now two discs for the price
of one. If you’re still wary, or ashamed to be seen selecting such a com-
bination, order by mail.‘In thewords of "Popsicle? "If you wanna
keep cool, it does the trick." ‘

Seminar on available

fellowships scheduled

by SHARON SEXTON

The University Counseling Center and the Center for International
Studies have joined forces to present “Project Fellowship 1973.”

The program, designed to provide a review of major fellowships
available for the academic year 1973-1974, will include discussions on
application procedures, deadlines, and hints for successful funding.
The speakers are uniquely qualified to counsel fellowship applicants, as
all are either awardees, advisers, or members of national fellowship-
boards.

The entire program, scheduled in two parts, will last from 2-4:30
p.m. on Wednesday, March 22, in the Graduate School of Public Health
Auditorium. The first session, from 2-3, will be for undergraduates.
and session two will be for gradu te students. ' ‘

According to Tedie Fakles, coordinator of Career Planning Pro-

grams for the Counseling Center, the program is being offered at this 
time to give juniors a head start this summer writing for information ,-

on particular scholarships, and amassing letters of recommendation‘,
etc. Fakles maintained that with fellowships so difficult to get, timing
is a very important factor in success. A

High scholastic achievement as measured by QPA is a major con-

sideration in evaluating an application, she reminded. But Fakles ' 

also pointed out that QPA is not the only important consideration.‘Com-
mittees also look for involved, aware and articulate applicants. she
said. They realize that these qualities are often not measured by QPA '
and for this reason all fellowships are awarded through a final inter-
view, Fakles added. . -

Minority students. are also encouraged to attend as there are sev-
eral awards expressly for minority students (e.g. the Ford Foundation
award in particular).

Any student desiring additional information or who cannotattend

, Paulists were
. ’ founded in 1858
by Isaac Hecker, they were the
first religious Community of
priests established in North
America by an American and
for Americans.

Father Hecker, who was a cen-
tury ahead of his time, wanted
Paulists to be free of compul-
sory activities so they could be
ﬂexible enough to meet the
needs of the Church in every age
as they arose.

Today’s Paulist can be as in-
volved as he wants to be. He is
given the freedom to use his own
talents to do his own thing. He
may be a parish priest, an edu-
cator or a press, radio or televi-
sion personality.

Father Hecker discovered the
value of communications early.
With his monthly publications
and pamphlets, he laid the
foundation for the Paulist/ New-
man Press, the country's largest
publisher and distributor of
Catholic literature.

Today, Father Hecker’s vision
‘and foresight have led to the es-
tablishment of Paulist radio, tele-
vision and ﬁlm centers on a scale
that perhaps, not even he dreamed
of

 

But then, he had the vision.

‘-Woodrow Wilson ‘High School in Levittown, Pa. -At that time.
__ed_.would have preferred to attend a southern college in per-
of a_ swimming career. ’ . »

Fred didn’t exactly want to come to Pitt because, while it
:.a,d"a. beautiful pool, it had no swimming name. His parents.
 emphasized the academic aspect, won out, however, and
5;.-‘c§hose Pitt on the basis of its academic qualifications. ‘
Now, Lewis has exhausted his swimmingeligibility and
yes as‘Pitt’s premier long distance swimmer.

When’ “Bud” Lewis got here, he found his presumptions
6iitjPitt’s swimming program to be a naked reality. »

"I_,was a little naive at first," admitted the black-haired
-_l‘ete‘. "I didn’t realize swimming wasn't a major programgin
first year. I thought we were going to be good. But after my
»st’ year I realized it was a mediocre program."

_This must have been disheartening to Bud. being a person
,“‘doesn't‘ thrive on ' mediocrity. His excellent physi-
and neat attire indicate this.

Last year, a group of the swimmers, who were fed up with
ng an excellent pool with not much of a team to put in it,

‘eci: ed was time for a change. They asked for and got a coach

 a V T ’ who cared about swimming
and knew. what he was talking
about—Dick Bradshaw.

In turn. Lewis has changed
his mind about Pitt's swim-
ming program and about his
future in the sport.
“There were a lot of good
changes in the program this
year.“ he said. "Bradshaw
or knew what‘ he was doing. He

prepared us, he installed
A things like Saturday morning
 “BUD" LEWIS workouts, and he got to know us.”
_ 7.-Las_t year the menmen were 3-7. This year’s 4-6 mark,.
hough only slightly improved, showed a marked change in
rkouts, enthusiasm, and attitude.

,, "T'We- had some bad breaks," continued Lewis. "We could
E . very easily been 7-3 or 8-2.”

he menmen's schedule this year was a toughie, a trade-
a k_-of.Pitt teams. They met Syracuse (11-2), Kent State (10-
Maryland (13-2), and West Virginia (8-3) to name a few.
" Lewis‘ felt much better about the sport at the end of this
ar than he felt at the conclusion of his junior year. _ r ‘
‘;‘I-.want -to make my living from being a swim coach, some-
__.h_ere." he said.’

Since'Lewis is going to be around next year completing his
ti'_i_A_ies, Pitt seems like a good place to start. ,
 Bud, who holds Pitt records in the 1650 freestyle, the 1000
_r'.e-estyle, the 400 individual medley, and shares a record in the

00..-rjelay, admits he would like to be around to watch his rec-
rds_fall,. ’

'x,.If he does come back as Coach Lewis, he would join Big Ten
_ -ampion John Hahnfald and National champion Dick Ridze,who
0 “work with the team,and would receive no monetary "award
his effort. Dave Wessel, Pitt’s top-notch diver (1968-71), is
heonly other paid member on the staff besides Bradshaw.

, Along with Rick Rowe and Tom Hayes, Lewis traveled to
ice Eastern Championship the last three years. His fondest '
memories include victories over Bucknell (a school which he
ad thought‘ of going to and on which he knew a lot of the swim-
 'ersl., and defeating former high school Coach George Ingram's
on in"a meet against American University. Ingram is a man he
eply admires. - '

' Next year the tankers will not suffer from graduation.
There are only two juniors on the squad. While this seems to be
a" strong point, it also shows how lightly Bill Grant, Bradshaw’s

ed'1,7 recruits. ' V
.'Recentlv, Lewis has been showing recruits around campus.

aiding the team's overall cause. .
“,fIn_c'ollege a swimmer has to be good. He should get better.
 he should already have the talent'.’ noted Lewis with know-
ho worthy of a coach.

Before Lewis goes on to become a swimming coach in either

ollege or in the Amatuer Athletic Union, he will concentrate on

aining his apprenticeship. _

ﬁr _. Presently, Bud is trying to sell students on something he
Shunhed when he’ was a recruit’—’a swimming team,

Wordvmust have gotten around
that the Panthers were holding a

After the numerous fumbles
that riddled the offensive unit
early-in the workouts. a few of the
coaches must have wondered the
same thing. ,

The offensive _unit was not as
sharp as they were Wednesday af-

the loose ball handling.

"‘For today, they did what I ex-

sides were ready to do their best

to get moving. '

"I.think the offense’ realizes it

Scoring is the name of the game
in hockey and the -Pitt Hockey
Club is a prime example of an of-
fensively-minded team. Pitt has
scored more goals than any other

team _in the league and their of- '-

fensive style of play is even evi-
dent in the, team’s defense.

The job of a defenseman is us-
ually to check his opponents and
break up oncoming plays at his
own blue line,’-but Pitt defense-
man Joe Testa is no typical blue

liner. Testa_has geared his style-
of play to fit Pitt's offensive game

and the result has been goals.

-Testa leads the‘ league in- as-
sists and is a key factor in Pitt's
powerful offensive attack. The
lanky defenseman posseses un-
usually deceptive speed and uses
it to glide past his opponents" and
set up plays. ‘

“I’ll either try to split the‘ de-
fense or go around them," Testa
remarked, “or I’ll’ try to draw the
defense to me,‘ and ‘then try to
pass to an open man.”

Besides his speed. Testa also
boasts an extremely long reach

squads. was responsible for set-
ting the crowd afire with some
rather crisp hitting.

“The defense was very aggres-
sive,” continued Cecconi, “unlike
the offense they executed early.”

The coaching staff plans to run
the team through. a partial scrim-
mage every day. with at least one
scrimmage a week, on Saturday.

At the end of the first week of
workouts, the enthusiasm re-
mained undaunted. Player chatter
and pats on the back were the call
of the day. I '
“I think the players are enjoy-
ing playing football more so than

- theyihave done in the immediate

past, That’s a good sign. If you
can’t enjoy the game you run into

« some problems,” continued Cec—-

coni.

Head man Carl De Pasqua has a ‘
relatively young group of hope— _-
fuls and Cecconi feels that this is
responsible for the "worried at-.

titude,” particularly predominant
in the offensive squad.

The crowd, made up of high
school and college students to go-
along with an array of gridders’

parents, was bolstered somewhat‘ '

by the rather large number of

»' footballers sidelined because of

injury.

‘ 1 Stan Ostrowski, Tim Hornish,
‘and Jim Parros all missed the .

drill due .to injuries sustained
during the week. Ostrowski and
Hornish should be back soon, /but

' Parros will remain in a cast and

a decision is forthcoming to deter-
mine if surgery will be necessary.

and a respectable slapshot. Breez-

with one hand; '

-Testa’s rushes up "ice often

‘’ . bring the wrath of the fans down
_on him as they chastise him to re-
main at the blue line. "That‘s my ’

style of play," Testa replied. "I
think"I have the general ability to
carry the puck up ice, but if the

game gets tough I‘ll play conser-

vati.vely.“'

Tomorrow night the icers will
face Penn State McKeesport and
Testa will have to stick to his de-
fensive chores. Both winger Mike

Kohl and defenseman Duke.
Schaeffer have been suspended,
for_one game as_a result of a _

brawl in the team’s last contest
and will not see action. _Defense.-

.man Glenn’Hyde will also not be

dressed for the game due to

' spring football drills.

These athletes join an already
formidable injury list.

Dave Blandino (knee). Art Si-
mon (wrist). Dean Arlette
(wrist). Rod Kirby (wrist). Gary
Normand (knee), Bob Veilette
(knee), John Achenbach (ankle).
Tom Hasbach (shoulder). and Les

Out with Injury

Hopefully, the injuries will not
continue at such an alarming rate.

‘But, trainer‘ Willy Myers noted

that this is “common” for this
early in the year.

. On Monday, the second week of
the drill will get underway. There
are 14 days left in the spring drills-
and they promise to be an impor-

John Dorsey raced into the Pitt
Field House Tuesday afternoon,
late for his qualifier for the 50-
yard dash. That was to be the only
time the Zeta Beta Tau speedster
ever fell behind during the Inter-
fraternity track meet last week.

Wearing a borrowed sweatsuit

, and a pair of battered sneakers,

he qualified for both the 50 and the
220 yard dash. When the finals
were run on Thursday, he ran
away with both events with times
of 5.6 and 24.2, garnering 12 points
for his house. ,

But the double winner was not

« the only outstanding performer

from ZBT. Rich Markley, shaved
12.seconds from the old meet rec-
ord in the mile run with a sizzling
4:349, easily turning ‘back a fine
effort by Phi Kap Bill Rex, who
also broke the previous mark
with a 4:46 timing. ~

Phi Kappa Theta won the meet

But Phi Kaps win 

ZBT’s Dorseyshines

   

handily, as Rex, with help from
his brother Ray, Dan Lawyer and
Kevin Aul, won the distance med-
ley. The PhilKaps also made a
clean sweep of the relays, cap-
turing the 440 behind the strong
legs of Jerry George, R. Rex,
Dan Liefield, and Gary Blair.
George also added a pair of sec-
onds in the sprints, just behind
the streaking’ Dorsey.

Pi Kappa Alpha led by Al Steck—
el, who was victorious in the 50
yard low hurdles and third in the
220, was the \meet‘s bridesmaid.
The PiKA‘—s came in second in
both relays, losing by a combined
time of two seconds, as the baton
passers (Steckel, Kevin Crowley,
Paul Henderson, Mark Ross, Tom
Bailey, and Dave Cobb) eased_the
Pikes past Phi Gamma Delta for
the number two spot.
