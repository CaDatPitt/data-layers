SEAC members rally in D.C. against WTI

By Kelly B. Casey
Photography Editor

Three months "ago, Pitt stu-
dent Jonathan Riddle was elat-
ed by Vice President-elect Al
Gore’s campaign promise to
thwart operation of an Ohio
toxic waste incinerator until
further investigation of its
health effects.

Riddle wrote a letter
expressing his gratitude
toward the vice president for
his willingness to halt opera-
tion of the Waste
Technologies Industries plant
in East Liverpool, only 30
miles northwest of Pittsburgh.

Today, Riddle says he wish-
es he never sent that letter.

“lGorel totally turned his

back on it,” Riddle said, a day

after returning from a
Washington, D.C. rally
protesting the Clinton

Administrations refusal to
intervene in a Cincinnati fed-
eral appeals court decision.
The Wednesday decision gave
WTI permission to begin com-
mercial burning immediately,
overriding an earlier federal
court decision to halt burning
until the results from an eight-
day test burn could be stud-
ied.

The test burn was conduct-
ed in order to determine the
incinerator’s ability to filter
out harmful emissions —— par-
ticularly dioxin gas, which has
been linked to cancer and
other health problems.

Riddle, along with 12 other
members of the local branch
of the Student Environmental
Action Coalition, attended the
rally, protesting Gore’s broken
promise.

The SEAC members chanted
and waved banners outside
the White House yesterday
afternoon, trying to wake up a
silent administration.

“We did fall on pretty deaf
ears,” said Western
Pennsylvania SEAC coordina-
tor and Carnegie Mellon stu-
dent Josh Knauer. He quickly
added that the drive to
Washington, D.C., was not
completely in vain.

“I think we helped in raising
awareness,” he said.

Knauer said that SEAC plans

to keep up the pressure on
the Clinton Administration.
Over the past couple months,
he said, SEAC members have
written over 60 letters to the
administration regarding its
stand against the Swiss-owned
incinerator.

Riddle said that a couple
hundred protestors, including
East Liverpool residents and
environmental organizations,
attended the Saturday after-
noon rally that lasted from
about noon until 3 p.m.

Several police cars sur-
rounded the protestors who
waved banners, which ranged
from “Ban the Burn” to “Al

Opinions
expressed
on Brown's
artwork

By Kelly_B. Casey

Photography Editor

_ Like it or not, a Pitt students con-
troversial artwork can now be
seen.

Reactions to the David Brown
work, which nearly took a lawsuit
to get hung on campus, ranged
from outright disgust to “what’s the
big deal.”

“.1 think it’s disgusting, personal-
ly,” said a first-year CAS student,
who declined to give her name.

Others‘looked at it differently.

“Why did you make such a big
fuss over the penis tree? We’re all
human,” a CAS student Eveline
Darroch wrote in the comment col-
umn of the gallery sign-in sheet.

Vice Chancellor of Student
Aﬂfairs William Harmon, who took
a hard stance against displaying the
work on campus, conceded that at
least this gives others the chance to
decide for themselves.

Speaking on behalf of the uni-

person of Greek Week, Saturday’s events were
a combination .of two events normally held
separate in the past. He was pleased with the
way things happened this year.

“The event seems to be going very well; for
the first time we’ve combined things,” he
said. .

Informal Opening Ceremonies Chairperson
Hayley Soffer said that the carnival is the first
event where all the Pitt Greeks get together to
celebrate Greek Week.

“Basically it’s a chance to get fraternity and
sorority members together to start off Greek
Week,” she said.

According to Donofe, Greek Week is a great
chance to be charitable and show what good
Pitt Greeks can do for others.

“The reason these events happen is to
encourage others to see what we can do for
the corrmrunity,” he said.

versity, Harmon said, “We didn’t
consider it to have any artistic
Value. Now that it is hung, [the stu-
dents] can form their own opin-
ion.”

The artwork, which has been in
the media spotlight for the past
three weeks, was tucked away
under dim lights in the back of the
Connie M. Kimbo Gallery. The
piece, considered “degrading to
women” by Pitt’s administration,
was hidden behind a 6—foot parti-
tion and faced the back wall. As an
added precaution, a warning
notice hung on the gallery entrance
stating that Pitt does not necessarily
endorse the painting which con-
tains “sexually explicit imagery.”

See Artwork, page 6

Despite the pouring rain, the torch burned
Saturday as fraternity and sorority members
informally began Greek Week festivities.

Greek Week, a week of activities sponsored
by Pitt’s fraternities and sororities to raise
money for charity, has been a tradition at Pitt
for several years. This year, all money raised
by Greek Week activities will be donated to
Pennsylvania Special Olympics.

Festivities began in front of the William Pitt '
Union where several Pitt Greeks participated
in a torch run ending in front of Trees Hall,
where a large torch was lit. The festivities
moved inside to Trees Hall’s large gym where
both the Special Olympians and Pitt Greeks
celebrated with a carnival.

Several Special Olympians said that they
had a lot of fun during the carnival, which
included face painting, clowns, games and

Pharmacy students tour

By Julie Holaren
For The Pitt News

A large group of Pitt phar-
macy students learned about
controversial health-care and
animal research topics dur-
ing a recent recruitment tour
of pharmaceutical company
Eli Lilly.

Instead of parties and
relaxing in the Florida sun
over Spring Break, the 80
students saw the
Indianapolis company’s
research laboratories, drug
packaging assembly line and
technology centers that pro-
duce drug insulin and
xarious capsules and tab-
lets.

Company officials
addressed the skyrocketing
prices of drugs, a controver-
health-care topic.
Fourth-year student Jeffrey
Smith said there are miscon-
eeptions about the high
prices. I

"A majority of the public
doesn’t understand that it



costs about $525 million to
get one drug on the market,”
Smith said.

Mary Jo Carden, another
pharmacy student, said that
patients often do not under-
stand that their insurance
deductibles do not always
cover pharmaceutical prod-
ucts used during hospital
stays.

Animal testing, another
issue facing the pharmaceuti-
cal industry today, was
addressed during a tour of
the toxicology department,
where animal experiments
take place.

Company officials said
they do not abuse the ani-
mals but did not allow the
students‘ to see many ani-
mals, saying that ‘distractions
could ruin the testing proce-
dure.

Eli Lilly stressed that,
unlike many other pharma-
ceutical industries, a majority
of the company’s sales repre-
sentatives are actual pharma-
cists. In fact, presently all

CEOs of the company are
pharmacists.

“I think they value pharma-
cists more than other phar-
maceutical companies
because of our chemistry
training, knowledge of how
drugs work and patient
counseling,” Carden said.
“Another reason may be that
Eli Lilly, himself, was a phar-
macist.”

Eli Lilly’s Cray supercom-
puter, one of few in the
country, interested many stu-
dents. The computer has the
power to rearrange mole-
cules to fit different hu-
man biological receptors
to make new drugs or
check the efficiency of old
drugs. “

Students said that this type
of computer research is the
fastest-growing
research today. .

The students said they
were shocked by the benefits
Eli Lilly employees receive,
including free pharmaceuti-
cal products.

area of_

company over Spring Break

Because of the company’s

size, every employee also-

has his or her own bicycle
for transportation in the
halls. Vending machines in
the company sell tickets to
sporting events, movies,
operas or plays at a discount
rate, and there are also
fitness and health centers
in every plant of the compa-

ny.

Eli Lilly provided comp1i- L

mentary limousine services
and fine cuisine, student
Jerry Simmons said.

“They were out to impress
you and did a really good
job of it,” Smith said. “It was
very different than I thought
it would be.”

Eli Lilly conducts similar
recruitment tours for 60 dif-
ferent pharmacy schools
yearly.

The experience proved to
be very educational, accord-
ing to student Jennifer
Gobrecht.

“It was a fantastic trip,” she
said.

Study Abroad scbolarsbzps
awarded to students
travelling this summer

By Bryan N. Iams
For Tbe Pitt News

Twenty-three Pitt students will study in foreign cities ranging
from Taipei, Taiwan, to Warsaw, Poland, this summer after being
awarded Study Abroad scholarships.

The Nationality Rooms and International Exchange Programs
awarded its annual Summer Study Abroad scholarships Saturday
at the Cathedral of Learning.

Last years recipients of the award told this years awardees to
be on their guards, take advantage of the hands—on experience
and, most importantly, to soak up the whole intercultural experi-
ence.

Christie Bray, winner of this years Women’s International Club
Grant, will study in Freiburg, Germany.

‘‘I am extremely excited and hope to improve my proficiency in
the German language and become a stronger individual,” she
said.

“Studying abroad gave me a greater sense of confidence and
maturity,” said Colleen Madden, a 1992 scholarship winner. “It is
really worth it.”

These scholarships have been awarded annually to Study
Abroad students since 1948 and range from $500 to $4,000.

The scholarships, awarded to 12 graduate and 11 undergradu-
ate students, are a result of the committee’s fund raising through-
out the year. Other awards are given in memory of an individual
or by a donor who believes in the commitment of excellence that
the Study Abroad program can provide.

To be considered for a scholarship you must be a full—time Pitt
student, have between 60 and 90 credits by the end of April and
have a minimum QPA of 2.75.

If these requirements are satisfied, a student must fill out a
seven-page application and have two references by the January
deadline. '

Twenty to 25 awards are usually given to students each year.
For each award there are usually five finalists, Study Abroad pam-
phlets stated. Each finalist is given a 10-minute interview, and
then the awardee is selected by a panel of faculty members.

Continued from page 1

The 32 other student pieces in
the Pitt Program Council sponsored
art show, ranging from a portrait of
Arnold Schwarzenegger to an
abstract sculpttue, seemed to have
been overshadowed by the 9-foot
by 3-foot painting, depicting a tree
resembling male sexual organs.

“The only reason I came over
actually was just to see what the
whole controversy was about,"
said a Pitt facilities manager, who
declined to give his name.

Most of the several gallery visi-
tors interviewed were glad that the
work was hidden in the back of the
gallery. but even the ones who
found it most offensive, agreed
lirown had the right to exhibit his
work.

"I think its disgusting," a first-

\e;tr‘ CA8 student said. “But we I

have to show it."

She said she was disappointed

The controversy over the paint-
ing began when the junior fine arts
student submitted his acrylic paint-
ing to the Pitt Program Council-
sponsored “Open” student art
show. A frve—student member PPC
art committee and Pitt’s administra-
tion rejected the piece.

Within a week, the ACLU, repre-
senting Brown, brought a lawsuit
against Pitt. Rather than going to
court, Pitt decided to allow the
work to be displayed in the show,
which runs until April 1 in the
William Pitt Union.

Once the art show closes,
Harmon said he plans to write an
open letter “to give reasons for the
justification of the action taken by
the. university.“

He has declined to say what
those reasons were until he has
time to "formulate” them in his
mind.

Brown said he is “relieved” that
his work is up.

"I‘m pleased as punch," he said,
adding that he has gotten only pos-
itive feedback from fellow stu-
dents.

“They're all real supportive.”

Dance

Continued from page 5

“We can get all the
Greeks in one atmosphere,
a party atmosphere, and it
is for a good cause,” she
said.

There were several con-
tests throughout the
marathon including a
dance contest, a banner-
making contest, a scav-
enger hunt and a karaoke
contest.

The dancers were tired
but kept a positive atti-
tude, although a few corn-
plained of minor fatigue
and aching feet.

McCue said some pre-
cautionary steps were

taken to make sure that
dancers had a safe time:
dancers had to take
breaks, eat candy, drink
sodas and water, and had a
45 minute dinner break.

According to Weiss, over
$100,000 was raised each
of the past three years dur-
ing Greek Week.

“We’re solicited by hun-
dreds of charities every
year to raise money for
them,” he said.

Weiss said that it was
great that Pitt Greeks could
come together to do so
much good for the commu-
nity. He added that the
success of the marathon

was because of the many
sponsors that contributed
gifts for prizes.

“The greatest thing that
made me realize this was
all worth it was that during
the week, my brothers
kept trying to make excus-
es to get out of this,” Weiss
said.

“Today they were walk-
ing up to n1e telling me
thanks and what a great
timeit was.

“They realize how much
good this is doing and
they’re too tired to put on
a cocky attitude about it,”
he said. “They’re really
saying what they mean.”

WTI

Continued from page 1
in which Gore wrote
specifically about the
health hazards of burning
toxic wastes near densely
populated areas. WTI
stands within a few hun-
dred yards of homes as

well as an elementary
school.
“As a student who

worked in [Clinton’s_l cam-
paign, I feel exceptionally
betrayed by these lies,”
said Knauer, who actively
campaigned for the
Democratic Party.

Riddle, who voted for
George Bush, said he is
also very disappointed in

the new administration. He
said he plans to express his
concerns in a follow-up let-
ter addressed to Gore.

“It’s beyond an environ-
mental issue with me,”
said Riddle, who plans to
reprimand Gore for “setting
a bad example” by his
inability to make a comrnit-
ment.

Gore, who, according
to the P0$t—Gazette, has
been ducking reporters’
questions concerning
WTI, blamed his inaction
on former President Bush’s
last minute granting of an
operation permit to WT I in
January. '

Put up or shut up

In his inaugural address, Bill Clinton decreed that “There is
nothing that is wrong with America that cannot be fixed by what
is right with America.” The same holds true for the rest of the
world. The leaders of the industrialized world must hold stead-
fast to their ideological views and assure the progression of
democratic principles in the Russian republic.

On Saturday, President Boris Yeltsin sent Russia into its deep-
est crisis since the 1991 coup by declaringemergency rule and
setting a referendum on whether the people wanted him or
hard-line rulers in power.

The country has run into a frenzy. His vice president, leaders
of the parliament and the chief justice all declared Yeltsin’s
move to assume power unconstitutional. Proposals for impeach-
ment are pending.

President Clinton immediately came out in support of Yeltsin’s
decision. He said that “as Russia’s only democratically elected
national leader, he has our support as do his reform government
and all reformers throughout the Russian federation.”

But while Clinton and other Western leaders have promised to
support Russian democracy, their actions state otherwise. Thus
far, the Westhas done nothing but provide billions of dollars
worth of aid to the former republic. .

With the world’s wealthiest economies — the United States,

.Germany and Japan -—— growing slowly or not at all, and press-

ing problems in Yugoslavia, Somalia and India, foreign aid can
no longer be openly handed out. Even if it could, providing aid
does not go far enough. By the time it can be decided what to
do with the aid it is usually wasted.

The governments of the world, if they are truly dedicated to
democracy, can take several steps:

-In the case of the former Soviet Republics, Western democra-
cies must act to insure that individuals take the lead to solve the
woes facing Russia. The IMF, World Bank and G-7 nations must
guarantee foreign investment in Russia and the other Soviet
Republics. If Western firms cannot be assured of their security,
Western desires for Soviet stability will be but an empty
promise.

-Secondly, Russia has the largest oil reserves in the world. If
the West were to transfer more of its technology and know—how
to this embattled country, Russia would be much closer to a
convertible currency and thus economic stability. Most impor-
tantly, however, Russia would be learning how to cope on its
own.

-Thirdly, the West must open up its markets to Russia and
allow them to earn hard currency. Goods sold on Russian mar-
kets do not earn top prices. Open American makets during the
1950's, is one reason why the Japanese are in the position they
are now.

Economic well-being and democracy, although interrelated,
are not siblings. Institutional development and political stability
are almost as essential to the development of Russia as unfet-
tered market forces. But, at least in the short term, history has
shown us that nations can become economically prosperous
without Democratic security.

The West can claim to be supportive. But, unless they takethe
proper steps to assure Russian stability, they will be nothing
more than liars. Smaller countries like Singapore, Hong Kong
and South Korea have become major economic players because
of the liberalized American market. As did the Western
European economies after World War II.

The same kind of treatment must be given to Russia. Or, per-
haps the idea of an industrialized and wealthy Russian economy
is too much for the West to handle. If that is the case, ‘then
maybe talk of aid is for good reason.

Questions about the N .Y.C. bombing

The bombing of the World
Trade Center occurred in a
mere momentary flash. And in
that one instant, America lost
its innocence. ‘

No longer is the United
States safe from the brutal ter-
rorist acts which have gripped
the rest of the world during
the last two decades. Seeing
thousands of innocent people
dragged out of the smoking
100—story building brought
back memories of the 1983
explosion at the Marine com-
pound in Beirut.

In the days following the
bombing, federal officials
beefed up security in major
government buildings
throughout the country.
Columnists from the New York
Times and The Washington
Post, as well as international
terrorist experts declared that
a new era has begun. The
frontier of terrorism that cur-
rently plagues Egypt, Israel,
India, the former Yugoslavia
and Great Britain has crossed
the seas onto American soil.

Some analysts say that the
United States can never
redeem its soiled image. The
ease with which the bomb
perpetrators could damage
one of America’s greatest
industrial trophies has terriﬁed
the public.

There are even some
extremists who suggest that
every public building should
become a fort like Israel,
where the threat of terrorism
has forced the government to
put up fences around public
buildings. Showing terrorists
that the United States is afraid
would only give them a major
victory in this psychological
war. ’

Instead, America needs to
regain its composure by stiff-
ening the stance against terror-

ism. Last week, Congress
introduced preventive mea-
sures against any further
attacks. '

One representative pro-
posed an anti-terrorism bill
that includes a new federal
death penalty for terrorist acts
resulting in the loss of a life,
new penalties for aiding ter-
rorists and additional proce-
dures designed to tighten up
immigration policy at U.S. air-
ports.

Another congressman sug-
gested legislation that would
bar the members of Hamas, an
Islamic fundamentalist group
now officially labeled by the
government as a group pro-
moting terrorism, from enter-
ing this country.

The Crime and Justice sub-

   
 

committee began debating
whether to expel Sheik Omar
Abdel—Rahman, the Muslim
religious leader who claimed
responsibility for terrorist acts
in Egypt and the possible mas-
termind of the New York
bombing.
I838!‘

But there is a curious ele-
ment to this latter provision.
While the connection between
the suspects at the World
Trade Center bombing and
Islamic fundamentalist groups
still remains sketchy as of this
writing, Congress has already
prepared to confront Muslim
extremists.

This legislation comes
despite the fact that FBI and
CIA officials have indefinitely
linked the bombing to the two
Palestinian suspects. There
also have not been trials or
any formal criminal proceed-

ings.

Yet, it is suspicious why
Congress has been so eager to
take a lead on this issue.
Congress surely wasn't as
enthusiastic in the early 1980s
when AIDS threatened the
security of this nation.

One explanation for this
nonincremental action is that
the United States needs a mili-
tary victory in wake of the
bloody cult compound stand-
off in Waco, Texas, and the
embattled head of the FBI
William Sessions.

There may even be a more
embedded theme here. Some
analysts say that Congress, FBI
and CIA deliberately pinned
the bombing on Muslim
extremists in order to cover up
some insidious secret from the
American public.

Examine the evidence: the
horrors Hamas and other
Islamic fundamentalist groups
committed against innocent
bystanders in Israel and Egypt
make them the perfect scape-
goat.

Who knows what kind of
evidence will turn up at the
bottom of the World Trade
Center garage in the weeks or
years to come? The investiga-
torswill hopefully nail the
right perpetrators some day.

But let’s leave that up to the
FBI and CIA.

Meanwhile, the rest of us
have lives to live, so let’s just
move on and try to return to
the waythings were. The last
things anyone should worry
about is being stranded in a
skyscraper.

Just in case though, I sure
hope Pitt’s Cathedral of

Learning building has a suffi- A

THE PI'l'l‘ NEWS, Monday, March 22, 1993

Sometimes I wish the NRA would just shut the he k up

Beliefs are a. funny thing.
While having strong beliefs can
be an admirable trait, it can also
lead to the abandonment of
common sense. I am referring
specifically to the NRA and its
beliefs about the Brady Bill.
While the Brady Bill is anything
but a new piece of legislation, it
took Clinton’s announcement
that he would pass it to bring
the aging bill back onto center-
stage. Since the announcement,
the NRA has been scrambling
about madly trying to lobby
Congress to vote down the bill
when it comes up again.

Named after James 8. Brady,
the former presidential press
secretary critically wounded
during the assassination
attempt of Ronald Reagan, the
bill was part of a larger anti-
drug package introduced in
early 1988. One of the main
thrusts of this package called
for the ban of 24 semi—automat-
ic weapons deemed too dan-

streets? With the Brady Bill
enacted, previous felons
would no longer be able to
skate through the system any-
more. .

Basically, a gun serves two
purposes: it is either used for
hunting or for self-protection.
As far as hunting is con-
cerned, a handgun is not the
weapon of choice for the law-
abiding hunter. And there is
nothing sporting about firing
off a 50—round clip to kill a
deer.

In terms of self-protection, it
is rare that a burglar calls his
victims’ house the night before
a burglary to give notice of his
intentions. In short, the Brady
Bill is neither denying any law-
abiding citizen from purchasing
a handgun, nor is it imposing
any unfair or unnecessary
restrictions upon potential
handgun purchasers. It falls
into the realm of “common
sense” legislation. Yet the NRA

favorites among terrorists and

and lifetime NRA member
George Bush vetoed the anti-
drug package, stating that he
would not support any legisla-
tion that banned the sale of
domestic or imported semi-
automatic weapons.

The bill does not impose
restrictions upon the sale of
guns to citizens. It simply
checks the buyers past records
for any criminal activity. To get
a gun today, the only thing you
have to do is fill out a form stat-
ing you are not a criminal.
How’s that for stopping the
proliferation of guns on our

NRA ran an advertisement
against the Brady Bill. It stated,
“Remember that a ban against
any gun threatens all guns.”
This statement is ridiculous on
two counts. First, the Brady Bill
does not affect the sale of guns
to people, unless they are or
have been a felon. The bill
exists only as a check system to
keep criminals from purchasing
handguns. Secondly, the ban
on semi—automatic weapons
does not threaten all guns. As a
part of our constitutional rights,
we have the right to bear arms.
The weapons which were
banned have no place in the
hands of civilians regardless of
the reasoning.

University Democrats

It was with great delight
and glee that I read the arti-
cle by Shawn McClearn in
last Thursday’s Pitt News. In
case you missed it, the presi-
dent of the University
Democrats took to criticizing
me and the organization of
which I am president, the
Pitt College Republicans.
While I don’t mind the per-
sonal jibes, I feel that his
diatribe against my group
must be responded to.

My interest in the College
Republicans began when I
arrived at Pitt three years
ago. I was attracted to the
group because it had similar
convictions to my own.
Besides, it was the only
group on campus where a
“conservative” did not have
to live in fear of being
accosted by the liberal-left
types that dominate the Pitt
atmosphere.

We at the CRs had many
good times registering peo-
ple to vote and helping out
with the various campaigns.
It was in great part due to
the hard work and dedica-

tion of the CRs that people
like Congressman Rick
Santorum and state Senator
Melissa Hart got into office. I
believe that one of the great-

est things the College
Republicans, or any group,
can .do is get people

involved in the political
process.

On the night of Feb. 22,
the CRs had a meeting at
which the director of the
Board of Managers of
Soldiers and Sailors
Memorial Hall spoke about
the issue of gays in the mili-
tary. We invited David
McMullin to speak to con-
tribute to the free exchange

of ideas — knowing that
there would be some who
disagreed with his

opinion.This vet gave a talk
from the perspective of
someone in the military and
commented on what he
feared would be the adverse
affects of President Clinton’s
proposed policies.

Of the approximately 75
people in attendance, about
10 were from groups that are

9

 

 

The NRA, however, does not
see it that way. It has become
so rabid toward gun legislation
of any form that it intentionally
deceived the public of the
intentions of various gun con-
trol legislation. NRA magazine
advertisements have stated that
if the Brady Bill were passed
then every owner of semi—auto-
matic weapons would be fin-
gerprinted, interrogated by the
FBI and charged $200 for every
semi—automatic weapon
owned. This is complete fiction.
In the words of Sarah Brady,
“The only reason to oppose the
Brady Bill is because the gun
lobby opposes it.” This comes
from the owner of a .38, too.

Another popular argument of
the NRA is that “guns don’t kill
people, people do.” Under
these premises, guns should
not be banned. Well, it is true
that if someone is determined
to kill another, almost nothing
can stop him or her. However,
why make it easier- for someone
to be able to do so?

It is true that the government
cannot keep guns out of the
hands of all criminals; a black
market will always exist.
Instead, the Brady Bill has been
employed to keep the less-

could use a

in favor of changing the
Pentagon’s policy.
Everything was just fine until
I opened the meeting to
questions. At that time sever-
al of the individuals opposed
to the Pentagon’s policy felt
the need to give speeches on
the subject. I wanted to keep
the “question time” time for
questions and cut those off

Kevin
Docherty

that wanted to articulate
their opposition to the
speaker. Free speech does
not mean the freedom to
give a speech when you are
supposed to be asking a
question.

I was delighted to see
Shawn McClearn at the CR
meeting. I had hoped he had
finally seen the light, and I
figured that he had grown
tired of mollycoddling the
left wing interest groups of
the Democratic Party.
Unfortunately, he was not

T,“
crafty felons from purchasing
the guns. If the Brady Bill can
save one life, then it has done
its job. Had the Brady Bill been
in effect before, the four mem-
bers of the ATF killed in the
Waco raid might still be alive
today. Several years before.
David Koresh made his national
television debut as Jesus Christ,
he had been charged with
attempted murder in another
shoot-out with an opposing cult
member. The Brady Bill might
have been able to play a part in
keeping Koresh from acquiring
the stockpile of weapons which
he has.

So deeply has the NRA
entrenched itself in its own
beliefs that it can no longer
rationally look at any gun legis-
lation. As an organization, it has
lost sight of its common sense.
And that is a most dangerous

opinion of the CR meeting.
Unfortunately, he did not
show up and sent a proxy,
the vice president of the
UDs.

He explained that Shawn
had too much homework to
do. Imagine my surprise
when the first caller to the
radio talk show was none
other than Mr. McClearn. He
set his proxy on the show up
for a fluff question on
Clinton’s proposed tax
increases. Then, 20 minutes
later, Mr. McClearn called in
again with another fluff

question. I identified Shawn
and proceeded to demolish
the Democratic “reasoning"
behind a tax increase while
increasing spending in order
to reduce the deficit.

Shawn claimed in his arti-
cle that when he attended
the CR meeting he was look-
ing for pointers on how to
run a successful student
group.

Well, one of the ways is to
be open and honest and not
lie and write columns in the
school newspaper if you
have a gripe about another
group.

To show that there are no
hard feelings, I make Shawn
this offer: If you would like
to hear my ideas about how
to run a successful group
and are serious about
improving yours, I would be
willing to attend a meeting

the number of people in
attendance.

Eric Mobley and the Panthers were left with nothing to do but ponder what might have been after Utah eliminated them
from NCAA Tournament Friday night in Nashville.

Pitt fails to walk the walk after talking the talk

By Ryan Buncher
Sports Editor

Pitts selection to the NCAA men‘s bas-
ketball tournament was met with heavy

criticism and predictions of an early

departure.

The Panthers fired back by insisting
they belonged in the tourney and bravely
predicting their chances to do well once
there.

Even after the 86-65 dismissal his team
received from Utah Friday night, Pitt
power fom='ard Chris McNeal still insisted
that Pitt was a legitimate threat.

"\\"e deserved to be here in the NCAA
Tournament," McNeal said. “We didn’t
tum-. a good showing  tonight, they
m-rc: a better team, but I still think we
can plgiy and be successful in this tourna-

ment.”

McNeal also said before the game that
Utah would have to worry» about match-
ing up with Pitt, but it was the Panthers
who never could match up with the Utes
and seemingly endless stream of outside
shooters.

“Their perimeter game was just too
much for us," Evans said. “We didn’t
match up real well. Phil Dixon [who
scored 22 pointsl really hurt us. Antoine
Uonesl is the guy that plays Dixon. That
forces Chris lMcNeall to go against Giant.
We had a mismatch there all night."

Pitt's most important source of confi-
dence before the game was the fact that
Utah plays primarily a man—to-man
defense. Throughout the season, much
has been made of Pitt's inability to handle
zone defenses. but Utah decided to stay

with the man.

“Tonight, our emphasis was coming
out and playing tough defense, man—to-
man,” Utah point guard Jimmy Soto. “We
heard that teams had played zone against
them and [playing against the zone]
was probably one of their weaknesses.
But we felt like we could get them out
of their offense with what got us here.”

According to Pitt point guard Jerry
McCullough’s pregame comments, this
played right into the hands of the
Panthers.

“We don’t. think anyone can guard us '

inside or outside if they play us man-to-
man," McCullough said. “The only trou-
ble we had all year was against the zone.
I think any team that plays us man-to-
man  they're gonna get beat  The
only thing that means anything to me is

they play man-to-man, and that gives us a
lot of confidence.”

At times, Pitt’s low-post players made
McCul1ough’s words ring true. When
given room, center Eric Mobley was
unstoppable inside.

Except for one three-pointer, power
forward Chris McNeal eschewed his usual
taste for the outside shot and looked to
fill it up from within the lane.

For the most part, however, Utah was
able to collapse on the ball whenever Pitt
passed it inside.

Their sagging man—to—man stopped the
Panthers enough that they could not
hope to keep up '\.\'l!li Utah’s outside
shooters.

Rhymes, Pitts offensive  helped the

Women's gymnastics
slips into regionals

By Todd S. Rimer
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s gymnastics team’s performance over
Spring Break, in which it had the three best meets in its
history, earned the team the opportunity to compete in
the ECAC Championships at Towson State this past
weekend.

That gave Pitt the chance to qualify for the Regional
Championships if two things. happened. The Panthers
had to outscore the University of Vermont —- which was
competing against them at the ECACS — and to outscore
Temple University -— which was competing in another
conference championship. Both schools were challeng-
ing Pitt for the seventh and final spot in the regional
rankings.

The second thing was for the Panthers to come out
and do what they have been doing the past three meets
— go out—perform up to their level of potential and put
up the numbers that they are capable of earning.

Pitt has averaged a score of 187.65 in those meets, and
it was most likely going to need a similar score at the
ECACs in order to clinch a berth in the Regional
Championship.

Pitt did what needed to be done. The team scored in
the 187 range (with a score of 187.2), and it beat both
Vermont and Temple. All of this spells victory for Pitt
and a guaranteed invitation to the Regional
Championships, which will be held on Saturday, April 3,
at Ohio State University.

With their score, the Panthers finished fifth in a field
of seven teams at the ECACs. The top spot went to
Towson State University with a score of 191.25. New
Hampshire (189.7) placed second and Maryland (187.9)
was third. William & Mary finished just ahead of Pitt
with a score of 187.3. James Madison University (186.45)
and Vermont (186.35) brought up the rear.

Pirates enter down tixne in cycle

Do you think the Pirates
are pumped up about the
upcoming season?

Let’s see  three years
ago, when the Bucs won
their first of three straight
N.L. Easy Division
Championships, the motto
we kept seeing on the com-
mercials was, “We Believe in
the Bucs.”

Two years ago, it was
“Back for More.” Last season,
trying to keep fans interest-
ed after the offseason losses
of Bobby Bonilla and John
Smiley, the motto became,
“The Fire Still Burns.”

Now, with the mass exo-
dus of players from last
year’s divisional champs, the
Pirate management appar-
ently is making no attempt
to mislead the fans. A
recently released commercial
includes the phrase, “Burgh
Ball 2 — It’s better than stay-
ing at home.”

Why don’t we just say “The
1995 Pittsburgh Pirates --
we’ll probably stink real
bad, butcome out and see
the game anyway because
we put more peppers in the
nacho cheese sauce.”

However, even though this
year’s rabble is not expected
to be nearly as successful as
those of the past three years,
loyal Pirate fans will still
flock to see the games, if
only to witness the first
stages in three potentially

CAP,

stellar careers.

When outfielder Al Martin
and infielders Carlos Garcia
and Kevin Young are intro-
duced to the Three Rivers
Stadium crowd on opening
night against San Diego,
loyal Pittsburgh followers
will remember the early
years in the Jim Leyland
reign. Those years of the
mid-1980s, in the wake of
drug trials, rumors of the
departure of the team and
seasons with 90-plus losses,

Tom
Schneider

were also the formative
years of two youngsters by
the names of Barry Bonds
and Bobby Bonilla.
Somebody once said that
all things happen in cycles.

"This truism could not be

more apparent than in the
similarities between the
events of the mid—’80s and
those of the recent offsea-
son.

I won’t even get into the
losses of Bonds, Drabek and
Lind, because the quality of
the players Pittsburgh lost in
the mid-’80s doesn't com-
pare to the caliber of these
three players.

But how about the influx
of washout veterans this

year, which the management
hopes will lend experience
to the young team? Do Jolm
Candaleria, Lonnie Smith
and Tom Foley bear a dis-
tinct resemblance to Jason
Thompson, Steve Kemp and
Sixto Lezcano? To diehard
Bucco fans, they will.

-Pugs and J.B. have
recently eluded to the fact_
that there is some really
wacky dope floating around
right now. This must be the
same stuff that has found its
way into the hands of Steeler
quarterback Neil O’Donnell.

Whatever the stuff is, its
effect is obvious and devas-
tating because it has
O’Donnell thinking he is
worth $13 million over four
years. That’s bad.

It also has him saying that
he carried the Steelers into
the playoffs. Oh God, some-
one find this stuff and flush
it down the toilet.

Let’s not even talk about
the fact that O’Donnell is
still wet behind the ears or
the fact that several people
wanted Bubby Brister, the
proverbial scapegoat, to start
the AFC Divisional playoff
game against Buffalo. Let’s
just talk about the ridiculous
magnitude of the contract
O’Donnell is asking for, and
may very well get, from the
Tampa Bay Bucs.

defense of the Utes. They  ’
packed things up inside. not 
leaving enough room for Pitt's
inside players to operate and
cutting off the lanes for the
guards to penetrate. A

"Jerry [McCullough] needed
more room to penetrate and dish
off. and he just couldn’t [find

“It seemed like things were
clustered up in the middle 21 lot,"
forward Brian Brush said. “They
obviously  knew that we
wcren’t a great shooting team.
They didn’t play zone  but
they played more of a sagging
man. They collapsed on the ball
in the middle."

Regarding some of the other
remarks from the Panther camp
— Utah forward Josh Grant
didn’t play like he was old
enough to be Josh Grant’s father
and Utah Coach Rick Majerus,
although not a small man by any
means. is not actually larger than
Pitts whole front line.

After all the pregame talk,
Utah took care of business on
the floor then disavowed any
knowledge of any Panther ram-
blings. 

“\Y/e’re lucky to get a paper in 
Salt lake [Cityl,” Majems said.

At least somebody was spared.

On this event the top gym-

competitors.

Kristin Brown and
Jorgensen tied for fifth, each
earning a score of 9.650.
Toellner’s score of 9.5 earned

Friend was the top gymnast

competitor on the day with
an all-around score of 58.1,
only .25 off her personal best
score which she earned this
season and only .35 off the

Consequently, Kristin

Right after Jay is informed

advantage in the post.

Using good rotation, Utah
was not able to stop the
Panthers inside but was able
to limit the damage enough to
keep Pitt at a comfortable dis-
tance.

The Panthers stayed close in
the first half by dominating
the boards to the tune of a 27-
11 edge. The margin slipped
to only 18-17 in the second
stanza as things totally unrav-
eled for Pitt.

“In the first half, they kicked
our behinds on the boards,”
Utah forward Josh Grant said.
“In the second half, I think we
dug down a little bit and
blocked some people out and
let them get [only] one shot. I
think that was the key.”

Another key was a lineup
change by Evans. Rhymes,
who had been buried on the
bench for all but a few not—so—
precious minutes over the last
few weeks and not playing at
all in the Syracuse debacle,
suddenly found himself on
the floor for 21 minutes in the

NCAA Tournament.

"Going to the NCAA tourna-
ment  I got excited about
that and started practicing
harder.” Rhymes said. “lBeing
in the tourney] motivated me."

Evans said the sudden re-
emergence in the game of the
6—foot—4-inch junior college
transfer was an attempt to

rejuvenate Pitt’s slumping

attack by playing Rhymes at
point guard in place of Jerry
McCullough.

“We needed sortie more
offense. We thought he could
give us a little bit more,"
Evans said. “'Jerry’s been
struggling offensively.
[Rhymes] probably did a bet-
ter job defensively than he’s
done all season. He had sortie
turnovers that really hurt us.”

Among the junior guard’s
four turnovers was a killer
midway through the second
half. Pitt had drawn within
seven, and the ball fell into
Rhymes’ hands. He fired a
long outlet pass, which over-
shot Eric Mobley and was

bench under the basket.

Pitt pulled within eight as
Rhymes banked in a short
jumper with just over six min-
utes remaining, but Phil
Dixon popped in a trey to
raise the lead back to 11.

The Utes extended the lead
from that point on. Utah sixth
man Darroll Wright put the

‘exclamation point on his

team’s victory with a toma-
hawk jam extending the mar-
gin to 17 just after the three-
minute mark.

The Panthers did a decent
defensive job on Utah’s star
forward Josh Grant, but the
third-team all-American inan-
aged to shake loose for 17
points, mostly on garbage
buckets and three treys. Other
weapons stepped up for the
Utes. Dixon (a game-high 22
points) was the perfect exam-
ple of the Utah effort —— excel-
lent shooting from three-point
range (five of seven) and the

three-point line (five of six).

The Utes drained 15 of 17
free throws, a scintillating 88
percent. It was the Panthers
who continued to struggle
from the charity stripe, hitting
only five of 12 on» the night.

Mobley had a solid game
but was the picture of the Pitt
effort. He was unstoppable
inside, but struggled with
turnovers (two) and missed
free throws (0 for four).

“Our foul shooting  [all of
our] shooting has been poor
the last six, seven games.“
Evans said. “We really strug-
gle to hit a jump shot."

“We got good looks at the
basket  it just wasn’t falling
tonight,” McNeal said.

The combination of two
many mistakes and a strong
opponent raining threes from
the sky ‘like pennies from
heaven left Pitt with nothing
to do but shake its collective
head and ponder another

loss —— this one ending a sea-
son that once was full of
promise.
