Students Urge

To Contribute

To Red Cross

Incomplete figures on the re-
cent - Red Cross drive at Pitt
show that this year’s ﬁgures are
far short of last year's totals of
$6314.81 for faculty members and
$l732,82 for students. So far, 1600’
students have contributed $1011.35,
to the drive and faculty returns,
estimated to be about one-half of
the expected total, have amounted
to $1168.24.

Contributions to the drive will
be accepted in the dean of wom-
en’s oiﬁce through Friday, March
15. Checks should be made paya-
ble to the Pitt Student Red Cross
Fund.

“On behalf of the University

Red ‘Cross committee, I’d liketo .
thank everyone who had any part 
in the campaign, and in 'parti-c- _;

Glass May Filrnish

sAtomic Defense

Dr. Alexander Silverman, head
of the chemistry" department, told
Detroit members of the American

Chemistry Society last night that;
glass may furnish the long sought-'

for defense against the atomic
bomb. Uranium, _he pointed out,

produces the best-known protec-_

tion against x-rays and other

harmful radiations.

In the f.uture~, rescue squads’

working in atom—bombed areas

will wear garments of ‘uranium or‘
lead with glass in plate form to,
protect themselves from radiatiom
Oxygen respirators will be equip—~§
ped with glass-insulated high-fre-f

quency precipitatorsto keep radio-
active dust out of the lungs of
rescue workers.

The peace-time blessings of
glass will include glass houses,
glass insulating walls, transparent
ovens, insulation windows, and a
variety of textiles and fabrics.

Great wars leave many unsavory things strewn in their
wake in addition to their accustomed quota of death and de-
struction. This time, as last, ‘the vicious “after-tide” is bring-
ing us awavc of"cynic=.ism and pessimism. It is a creeping subtle
thing that matcrializcs around us and then dissolves into noth-
ing as we seek to pierce_ and explore it. VVc hear it in our
schools, read it in our newspapers, and sometimes ﬁnd ourselves,
half unknowingly and untthinkingly, repeating its tenets ‘ to
others. _ i 
Students and returned ‘soldiers everywheie arc.1I1-‘akingi
much ado over the alleged fact that opportunity, as‘we knew 
in the past, has vanished from the American scene. They spealzl
vaguely of the ‘,‘rulc of the wealthy,” the “power of gia11t‘~cor§
porations,” a1icl"'.‘f‘socia.l inequality.” They-‘read ‘the workslof
pseudo “l1alf-baked” economists such as Veblen, Stuart ’Ghase‘,
and others, anddream of hazy Utopias where ‘everyone: gets
everything he wants with either very little labor-or none at all.
They discuss, they read, they write, and yet~—‘ironical1y enough
—-—they never» catch sight of the one undeniablcfact ‘which stands
as a beacon guiding men’s minds to “truth in our time.” This
simple fact is that as long as America remains.America, Utopia
is ours for the taking.» Contrary to the wishy-‘washy .ar‘guments
of our present “lost --generation, ” our country is still a place
xvherewliaft a man can make of himself is limited only by his
own a-bility and ambition. _ '

In spite of what. the cynics say, the curtain has not-fall-enon
the “rags to riches” drama we have long been so proud of, for
throughout our land men are still rising‘ from humble beginnings.
We admit that some corporations are powerful, (which is-as it

should be since the people own them) and, on the ottherhand,

we point to a certain coal miner’s son who currently headsone
of the largest. It‘ may be true that many people are unjriistly
deprived of the beneﬁts of higher education, but still, a non-
college man has recently become our cl‘1ief»executive. ‘

Of course, our present generation has been spoiled ‘=‘-and
babied by such things as unemployment compensation socasily
obtainable that even strikcrs—1nen who are deﬁantly refusing
to work--are eligible to receive it. Therefore, itmay well be
that the present pessimistic complex combined with a “world
owes me a living” attitude is only natural. However, Ameri-
cans must be made to see that we have not reached our liinits
but stand only atour beginnings. America. will go down only
when Ame1“icans lose their zest for living and ilheir inborn faith
in the future. .Amcrica willbe strong as long as her sons -have
wliat it takes to seize their chances at Utopia and nuakc the most
of them. Should the virility of /\1nc1’i(:.a11 ambition ever fail,
then nothing, truly notthing of any import, will ever “liappcn
here” a.gain.—-—Jim Pcttican.

At any time when a new order of life is brouglit about, an
individlial feels, at least temporarily, that the former Way was
best. He laments the advantages lost in the “good old times”
andibcwails the disaclvantagos of the present day. His intro-
duction to unfamiliarcustoms results in a healthy reaction. He
gripes. ‘

While this practice in the’Univcrsity today iniplics non-
appreciation of the beneﬁts available from our daily associa-
tions, the existing‘ttendency is entirely without substantiation.
Even though higher education has become a means to increase

traps,

our future earning power and should be guided seriously toward
that goal, there are inmimcrablc aspects of college life which
aid in the broadening of our character. For this purpose, the
many activities and organizations are founded. They instill a
loyalty Ito the University through the participation in their
function. Our four years in the University would be dull in-
deed were it not for the diversionof events sponsored by the
student governing body, planned by student chairmen and busi-
ness managers, advertised through the student newspapers and
campaig~ne<l for by student solicitors. Passing to and from

ganizations which, in the p-erl:'ormancc of their speciﬁc jobs
give us something to applaud or criticize, would be endlessly
routine. There is no such thing on Pitt campus as a lack of
spirit. The choice of an activity today is only subject to the
desire of the individual.

But it is not by the mere saying that we are afforded this
wide range. There is a history of enterprising students who
un(_lm'took the original planning. They built the foundations,
relieving us of a l‘1ugc task, so tthat now these outside pursuits
are open to all who care to apply a little effort. The outlet for
personal experience is here and can be used to advantage."

However, the initiative to ‘get o11t the energy pills nec_essar_v
for the great discovery lies‘ with the individual, the same indi-
vidual who gripes and groans over the stupendous inefﬁciency
of his routine. Life in this school is “tops” for those who want
it tliat way. For these, Pitt has become a. source of inspiration,
a living part of a life we will alwa,v‘s carry with us. These have

“Ever since -I can remember, I
have been connected with the
University of Pittsburgh in some
way.
faculty family, a student, wife of
a librarian, and now I work
here.” That was Mrs. Helen
Frost Rice, librarian in the All-
dred room, whose whole life has
grown around Pitt. Her father,
Albert Frost, interested in ﬂ|ig\ht,
first came to ‘Pittsburgh as an as-
sistant to Langley in the Alle-
gheny observatory. Afeter teach-
ing in the Pittsburgh high schools
he came to the University as reg-
istrar. As a member of the regis-
trar’s family, Mrs. Dice got her
first impressions of the University
of Rittsburgh. She can remember
being taken to one of the very
earliest co-mmencements and
squirming through the salutatory
and the valedictory which were
given in Latin by one of the first
women at Pitt. The ,University
Chancellors, Dr.
Bra=shear. and Dr. McCormick
were entertained by her parents
in their home. “One time Dr. Bra-
shear patted me on «the head,” she
said, “and once when I was eight
Dr. Holland ca-me to inquire about
my brother who was ill,
found -me ironing shirts. I still
remem-ber his praise — and his
amazement that I could iron
shirts.” She can remember the
Stein sisters very well, the first
Pitt co-eds.

As a student Mrs. Dice’ was
here when the school moved from
the North Side and had its name
changed from Western University
of Pennsylvania to the University
of Pittsburgh. She entered in a
class of eleven, :1 very remark-
able class. It was the largest in
the history of the University at
that time. At Pitt she met Eliza-
beth Levin Stern, who wrote “My
Mother and I”; met Dr. Luba
Robin Goldsmith, one of the ﬁrst
women to graduate from the
Medical school. -It was at Pitt that
she met J. Howard Dice, a fel-
low student, who became her hus-
band. “A campus romance,” she
called it. In 1916 she graduated
from the College and started. the
next phase of her atfiliati-on with

‘Although his slow flowing drawl
and easy-going ways seem to belie
the fact, Grover “Mac” McCann
is one of the select group of activi-
ties men who really make the

wheels go ’round. “Mac” came to
Pitt via Carrick high and the Uni-
versity of Tennessee. In his high
school days, he was interested in
publications, soccer, and acting in
class plays. Concerning his one
year sojourn in the land of corn
pone and boll weevils, “Mac” says,
“The girls are as beautiful down
there as they are up here,” which
shows that some things are rather
universal, aren’t they?

“Mac” saw World War II service
with an MP company, and upon
receiving that proverbial “slip of
paper” came to Pitt in the spring
semester of last year. Since then,
his star has cometed up rapidly
and he is currently Owl business

Mac is non-committal about his
love life to the point of asserting
it to be non-existent. However,
we have it on good authority that
his current amorous intentions are
directed toward a certain petite
“Fourth Estate” executive.

On the question of post-college
plans, “Mac” is currently divided
between industrial sales and ad-
vertising. Mac is known to many
News readers only by his army
serial number which serves as a
by~line for his Vet GI Zette col-

1:i..u.ing s1m.g.Exia.i_i-t1»s:

Fully aware that a critical
shortage of housing exists in this
city and throughout the country,
and that many veteran students
are affected by this condition, of-
ficials have nevertheless post-pon-
ed a request to the Federal Hous-
ing Authority for 300 emergency
unit to be constructed here. It is
felt that the need for housing in
other parts of the country is more
urgent at present, and that little
action could be taken in view of
the dearth of building materials
and manpower nee-ded to Supply
this quota.

Recently the FHA -announced
that 100,000 housing units would
be available to veterans residing
in areas where a shortage exists.
Accordingly the University pre-
pared a request for 300 units bas-
ed on estimates made at that time.
Under this program, housing
would be allocated by the gov-
ernment to be erected on uni-
versity property, erection and
maintainance costs to be borne by
the school. Despite the inﬂux of
3500 new students a_ survey dis-
closed that no housing shortage
exists for single men. Although
rooms are limited in the Oakland
district, the dean of men’s office
have been able to ‘procure ade-
quate quarters formale students
upon application and with a mini-
mum of waiting.

This is taken as an indication
that Pittsburgh will be able to ac-.
comodate additional students when
the University reaches its peak
of enrollment. At present there on
hand many more applications for
admission from Pittsburgh alone
than the University can possibly
accept. The dean of men’s office
maintains that the school will con-

tinue to accept qualiﬁed applicants
from Pittsburgh and out-of-town
insofar as facilities will permit.
“There are many more people
seeking admission to the Univer-
sity from the greater ‘Pittsburgh
area than can be accomodated.
Our limitations are faculty and
class room space. The problem in
other schools is housing. Alloca-
tion of housing to other schools
where the need is more urgent
will alleviate the situation consid-
erably to7the benefit of more vet-

erans," said ‘Theodore VV. Biddle,
Dean of Men.

Admittedly a serious situation
exists in the case of married stu-
dents. Due to this condition mar-
ried couples are living in rooms
with no opportunity for house-
keeping. The clean of men’s office
have been fortunate enough to
procure suitable quarters for a
large number of married students,
but the demand exceeds the sup-
ply of rooms, and the outlook for
these people is far from encour-
aging.

University officials have been
fully cognizant of the situation
and have done a capable job in
meeting the problem. This is indi-
cated by the fact that thus far in
spite of an unusually heavy en-
rollment, no extraordinary meas-
ures have been resorted to to pro-
vide its students with housing.

tudents can feel assured that the
school is exerting every effort in
their behalf, and when the need
becomes more acute, adequate
steps will be taken to assist him.

The city of Pittsburgh has pro-
posed the erection of army-type
barracks in the vacant lot adjacent
to the ‘Heinz chapel across Fifth
avenue. ‘This project will be under
supervision of the city and will
not necessarily be earmarked for
Pitt students. In the lightof. its
proximity to civic buildings this

proposal is the subject of bitter
debate by irate property owners
who see in it a threat to present
real estate values. Several organ-
izations have protested. erection of
the barracks and the city is faced
with the dilemma or building bar-
racks without infringing on the
rights of property owners who
voice objection to their presence.
In View of the fact that the,-Uni—
versity has not intervened in the
situation, this is not to be con-
strued as an approval of the at-
tempt to block this measure. Al-
though the University has been
approached by interests opposed
to the erection of these buildings,
the school will not align itself with
this movement. _

In discussing this situation, Mr.
Biddle said, “The Universityihas
taken no part in the attempt to
block the housing program “on_ the
Ruskin lot. If the city erects there,
I hope students will be permitted
to use facilities.”

The column before the storm!

Our valiant fraternity girls are
doing their bit to help the men
prepare for rushing by getting
them all on the w.agon——-there have
been more tea dances for the boys
than enough. We see the Dclts al-
ternating between tea dance at
the Tri Delts last week and one
tori"? with the Kappas. The Phi
Sig, _ook the Pi Lams under arm
at a tea dance last Friday. The
Phi Kaps were deluged in the
English brew through the court-
esy of Delta Zeta last Friday and
the Phi Mus Monday. ~

A little reluctant to the tea-bag
barrage were the SAEs who went
off to the University club last Sat-
urday afternoon to celebrate foun-
ders day. ‘The Phi Delts, too, de-
cided to turn the tables and have
the Thetas over to the house on
Friday for a buffet dinner dance.
(Tea was served only on request.)

The PiKAs took their dates to a
good old-fashioned house dance
last Saturday night, while the
Phi Eps completely without the as-
sistance of women held a stag
along with their alumni in the
Pilot house last Friday. .

wend their way to the ‘Pilot House
for an enjoyable afternoon of
dancing furnished by the Phi Eps.
Last Friday the The-tats‘ were the

CHLOROPRENE RUBBER DEVELOPEDTBY nu Raﬁ}

Chemists and Engineers Unite
to Produce “Neoprene/' Prove
Value of Group Research

I-IE synthesis of rubber was for many
years a challenge to the chemists of
the world. In 1925 Du Pont chemists un-
dertook to solve the problem, using as

their starting point a discovery an-
nounced by Dr. . A. Nieuwland at Notre
Dame University in connection with the
polymerization of acetylene. The Du
Pont research staff modiﬁed his process
to form a material known as monovinyl-
acetylene and discovered that this,
treated with hydrogen chloride gas, pro-
duced chloroprene, a chemical previ-

A hungry world cannot afford to waste
bread. Yet until recently millions of
pounds of bread were being wasted an-
nually in the United States because of
mold. There was a real commercial need
for a material that would delay the
growth of this food enemy, if only for a
day or two. But to meet requirements,
this material had to be edible, whole-
some, and completely beyond any sus-
picion of being toxic.

r Combined chemical and bacteriolog-
ical research resultcd in the discovery
that 0.3 % of calcium propionatc or
sodium propiionate in bread would de-
lay the growth of mold for as long as
two weeks. In commercial practice, a

concentration between 0.1  and 0.2 (‘O

was found to‘ be sufficient for average
conditions.

Calcium and sodium propionates are
made from propionic acid, the synthe-
sis of which (from carbon monoxide and
ethyl alcohol) is another chapter in the
achievements of Du Pont research-
and an interesting one. The propionates
occur in low concentration in Swiss
cheese and other dairy products, as
well as in the human body. Hence their

consumption in foodstuffs is both nat-

ural and safe.

pionates are called—-is " ' ‘hing exam-
ple of how intensive research solved a
problem which long perplexed baking
technologists.

ously unknown. Their next discovery
was that the polymerization of chloro-
prene resulted in a rubber-like solid, su-
perior, in many respects to natural rub-
ber itself! .5 ' ,

Neoprene, as this synthetic rubber is
now called, was first placed on the'ﬂ1ar-
ket in 1931. Although more cost1y.:t.han

natural rubber, the” demand for itfgrew _

rapidly. Du Pont engineers were called
uponto design and build manufacturing
units embodying improved equipment
and better production techniques. The
result is that today neoprene production
is measured in millions of pounds 74} year,
and the price is only slightly higher

“than that of prewar natural rubber.

The development, the improvement
and the large-scale production of neo-
prene are another tribute to the value of
modern, coordinated research. Neo-
prene is the result of ‘the cooperative
eﬁbrts of many Du Pont research chem-
ists, engineers and other technical men.
