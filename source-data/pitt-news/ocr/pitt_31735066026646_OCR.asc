 

Pitt students
narrowly
escape tornado

Heather Barnett

Staff Wrlter

It was something
you could read about or
see on TV, but experi-
encing it was incredible.
It was like something
out of a different world,
Robert Frank said of the
storm which did such
dramatic damage to his
Mt. Washington neigh-
borhood.

Frank, last year’s
College of General
Studies vice president,
returned home from
work about 10 minutes
before the tornado hit
Mt. Washington. Like
inany Pittsburghers, he
hadn’t been paying

‘much attention to the

warnings broadcasted by
local media.
“It’s something you

C don’t believe, so you

sort of go back to your
old routine,” he said.

 But the sky began to
darken ominously, and
television reception

worsened. Then Frank
heard a radio report of a
tornado touching down
in Sewickley.

Frank turned to one
of his roommates,
Raphael Nash, and sug-
gested they take cover in
the basement.

Nash didn’t. As he
explained later, “I didn’t
believe the news reports
because they hype
everything. I figured
they didn’t have snow to
hype this winter, so
they’re hyping this.”

But Frank wasn’t
taking any chances. He
took his radio down to
the basement, crawled
under a pool table and
waited.

About a minute
later, the power went
out. .

Frank said there was
“just a little bit of hail,
hardly any rain, and then
-— boom.”

The sound of a
freight train filled the air.

Museum figurines represent Hopi who dance to bring good crops.

Carnegie opens largest Indian
exibit east of Mississippi

Janet L. Syphan
Staff Writer

The Native American exhibit at the
Carnegie Museum of Natural History
used to consist of ﬁve or six glass cases
containing dark-skinned mannequins in
ceremonial poses.

One case ‘contained a Dakota war-
rior standing scantily—clad and scowl—
ing. Next to him, a Hopi Indian held a
snake in his mouth.

The cases displayed what most peo-
ple expected Indians to look and act
like.

But “these images are right out of
the worst John Wayne movie,” said
Lisa Mitten, a native Pittsburgher and
Mohawk Indian who works at Hillman
Library as a bibliographer.

Mitten was part in a consulting

a group for the urban section of the new

Alcoa Foundation Hall of American

' Indians at the Carnegie Museum, which

opened June 6.

The Alcoa Foundation Hall of
American Indians focuses on four
Indian nations: the Tlingit of the north-
west Coast, the Hopi of the Southwest,
the Lakota of the Plains, and the
Iroquois of the Northeast. Indians in
urban areas, particularly Pittsburgh,
also have a section in the Hall.

Not only did the museum consult
with 50 American Indians to create one
of the largest exhibits east of the
Mississippi, they also used casts from
living American Indians to create the
human ﬁgures in their dioramas —— a
scenic display of three—dimensional fig-
ures against a painted background.

The exhibit displays over 900 arti-
facts and several videos. Mitten said the
video of a powwow —— the gathering of
various tribes to share in singing, danc-
ing and renewing friendships ——
reminded her of watching an old home
movie. When local American Indians
came to the museum and watched it,

they recognized people they knew.

The exhibit also contains computer I

activities and a planetarium-style show
about how the stars and universe affect-
ed American Indian life.

The museum owned most of the
artifacts displayed, although they used 1

few of them in the previous Indian -

exhibit, said Sandra Lepri of the
Carnegie. '
She said this had to do with the lack .

of space in the museum, a condition ;

that left Native Americans under repre-
sented and incorrectly depicted.
“The old exhibit was something I

never wanted to take my kids to see,” i

Mitten said. “It was insulting.”

She described the Hopi Snake
Dance display as “misleading,” saying
it, as well as other displays, gave view-
ers inaccurate and sensationalized ideas

about Native American people and their Y I r

culture. A

“The museum displayed the arti-
facts without describing what they were
used for,” she said. “They were taken
out of context.” «

Dr. Pamela Soeder, a Muskogee’
Creek Indian and professor at Slippery
Rock, also worked with the consulting
group. She agreed with Mitten.

“Children walked away from that.
exhibit with confirmed stereotypes,”
she said. i

The Museum said they realized the ,
previous display did not represent
American Indians accurately.

“There were certain thoughts and
perceptions cast upon American
Indians,” Lepri said. “Everyone dis-
played American Indians from the
white persons’ perspective, not just
museums, but photographers, writers
and the entire society.”

Soeder, who teaches classes focus-
ing on cultural diversity, said she hopes
the Hall will dispel any misconceptions
people have formed because of the

  , UPMC awarded

$7.7 million

research grant

The University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center has the world’s largest
liver transplant program, and a $7.7 mil-
lion grant from the National Cancer
Institute (NCI) will help UPMC
researchers to further reﬁne the trans-
plant procedure and to study possible
vaccines for cancer.

“This funding provides us an
unprecedented opportunity to expand
our studies of dendritic cell biology and
its performance in disease,” said Dr.
Michael T. Lotze, lead investigator on
the grant; professor of surgery and mole-
cular genetics and biochemistry; and co-
director of the University of Pittsburgh
Cancer Institute’s Biological
Therapeutics Program.

Dendritic cells travel throughout
the body, identifying invading viruses
and bacteria and stimulating the immune
system to attack those invaders.

“We have a unique gathering of
internationally recognized investigators
who are exploring dendritic cell—based

. therapies at a time when the isolation,
» L culture and application of these cells to

human disease have progressed signiﬁ-
cantly,” Lotze said.

The grant will give researchers
money to study ways to increase liver-
transplant tolerance, and will fund ﬁve

* other projects at UPMC.

One project will focus on develop-
ing a cancer vaccine using dendritic cells
as a base. Another will attempt to genet-
ically modify dendritic cells so they
would ﬁght cancer. A third project will
search for a way to_develop a dendritic
cell—based vaccine speciﬁcally for lung
cancer.

A fourth project will focus on the
importance of dendritic cells in a mouse
model of diabetes, and a ﬁfth will focus
on how dendritic cells stimulate auto-
immunity in scleroderma, an abnormal
hardening or thickening of the skin.

The University of Pittsburgh
Cancer Institute is one of 31 NCI-desig-
nated comprehensive cancer centers.

CUPMC merges
with Horizon
Health System

UPMC has made a practice of
merging with smaller hospitals across
Western Pennsylvania, and now it is
merging with Horizon Health System of
Mercer County.

Horizon’s board of trustees voted to
approve the merger on May 26. The
transaction is expected to be completed
by mid-summer.

UPMC Horizon will operate as a

separate, locally managed division of
UPMC Health System. '

J. Larry Heinike, president and
CEO of Horizon, called the merger a his-
toric step for Mercer County.

“This step assures that the residents
of our area will continue to receive the
excellent care for which Horizon is
already known, as well as new programs,
new services and improved facilities,” he
said.

Two years ago, UPMC and
Horizon signed an affiliation agreement,
under which UPMC invested money to
expand programs, facilities and services
at Horizon.

STAT MedEvac medical helicopter
service, expanded emergency facilities,
and membership in the Center for
Emergency Medicine are among those
improvements.

UPMC will provide Horizon with
expertise in research, technology and
sophisticated medical procedures as a
result of the merger. .

The 15-member UPMC network is

ranked among the top-15 academic med— ,

ical centers in the nation in terms of fed-
eral research funding.

  Photographer finds Pulitzer in Africa

Jason Gallinger

Assistant News Editor

Martha Rial has seen lO—kilome—
ter-long lines of refugees wandering
in search of a safe place to stay. She
has seen families that considered
themselves lucky to have shoes. She
has seen a 10-year-old girl, a malar-
ia victim, buried beneath a mound of
earth and a simple cross.

She has witnessed the story of
the Rwandan refugees in Africa. As
a photographer for the Pittsburgh
Post—Gazette, she has taken pictures
of it all.

And this year she won the
Pulitzer prize for those pictures.

Last Wednesday, Rial, , 36,
addressed the Women’s
International Club of the Nationality
Rooms Program at the University
Club in Oakland, /presenting a slide
show chronicling her trip to Africa
to photograph the refugees

Rial, a native of Murraysville,
heard of the Rwandans’ plight from
her sister, a nurse in Tanzania. Rial
convinced her editors to let her make
the trip, and her photos and journal
were published in a special section
of the newspaper in January of 1997.

The Rwandans, she said, have
I “just fantastic faces.”

Mitten said she hopes the
exhibit will change the fact that
‘American Indians are under—rep—
resented in Pittsburgh. A

“Pittsburgh is a pretty black
and white city,” she said. “We’re
invisible.”

Soeder recalls a visit to the
museum during the eight—year
planning of the hall, . during
which a museum guide told her
Indians didn’t exist in Pittsburgh.

“And I thought, what about
me?” she said.

Unlike in the previous exhib-
it, American Indians approved all
artifacts before the museum dis-
played them.

The Museum also went to
great lengths to ensure that a buf-
falo killed for the display

received a proper blessing from a ;

medicine man.

Mitten thinks the museum
did a great job following up on
suggestions given to them by the

American Indian consulting
group. “They listened,” she
said. ’ I

They took her suggestion
about creating a photo wall that
shows not all urban American

stereotypical “John Wayne”

Frank described the tornado as a
big brown swirling mass of twirling
debris.

“It’s not like what you picture,” he
said. “You don’t see the funnel, just the
effects.”

As quickly as it had come, the
twister left. The sky suddenly cleared
up.

One of the few lucky residents of
Mt. Washington who had phone service
through the storm, Frank said he began
to realize how widespread the damage
was after receiving a call from his
father, who lives several blocks away.
While his house suffered practically no
damage, except for a neighbor’s tree
that fell into his yard, it became clear to
him very quickly that not everyone had
been so lucky.

“It’s a miracle no one was killed,”
he said. “That was sheer luck, with the
amount of damage, ﬂying signs and
ﬂying debris.”

Frank said he left his house and
started walking down Virginia Avenue,
which he said was “basically trashed.”

As the realization that the damage
in human terms could have been far
worse sank in, Frank said there was
“kind of a festive air — everyone sort
of having fun.” The mood was further
lightened when several stores, having
lost their electricity, started to give

away their stocks of ice cream.

Police had not yet arrived to deal
with the traffic problems on the
blocked roadways, so Frank directed
trafﬁc on McArdle Roadway for about
20 minutes until they arrived.

The helpful spirit of neighbors was
given many chances to shine through
that night, he said. -

“It was amazing the little acts of
heroism you found,” Frank. said.
“Private citizens were helping to close
roads, letting people use their cell
phones to call their family and tell then
they were O.K. There was a real sense
of community spirit. I really think it’s a
Pittsburgh thing.”

In the days that followed, many
storm victims would praise the men
and women involved in the cleanup,
according to Frank.

“It was amazing what a wonderful
job the city workers did, especially
Public Works,” he said. “After a couple
of days, it looked like nothing hap-
pened. All these tourists are coming up
now, and there’s nothing to see.”

Frank said he believes people real-
ize it could have been much worse. And
many hope that valuable lessons have
been learned in case of future emergen-
cies. Frank has a very simple starting
point.

“The number one lesson I learned
from this is to get a radio with a bat-
tery,” he said. “And candles are a good
thing.”

agents May 22 after state police lifted
his ﬁngerprints from the broken wind-
shield of a school bus parked at the
church. ‘

Investigators believe Davies
punched through the windshield, but a
motive has not been offered.

The bus window, a snow shovel and
broken window glass found at the scene
all yielded traces of blood.

“I have probable cause to believe
that the blood recovered from the wind-
shield of the Calvary Baptist athletic

FROM PAGE 1

-bus, the snow shovel and the broken

pieces of the windows belong to Todd
Davies,” Weiers said in the afﬁdavit.

Davies had no comment.

The blaze caused nearly $1.5 rnil—
lion in damage to the church and adjoin-
ing school and injured three ﬁreﬁghters.

‘ Davies attended Calvary Academy
from grades six through nine from 1983
to 1987, during which time his family
contributed about $13,500 to the
church, not including tuition. He was
also a parishioner for some time.

During ATF’s investigation, friends
of Davies’ told agents that Davies char-
acterized the church as a “cult” and said
that “the church’s preacher had taken all
of the Davies farnily’s money,” the afﬁ-
davit said.

When Davies showed one friend the
church, Davies asked him to throw

rocks through the windows with him.
The friend refused and drove from the
scene alone.

Davies also conﬁded in his ﬁiend
that he had broken some church win-
dows in summer 1997, according to the
afﬁdavit. Calvary Baptist pastor Charles
Dilabaugh confirmed windows had
been shattered, but no culprits had been
found. .

Two days after the fire, Davies and
a close‘ friend were drinking at a bar
when the ﬁiend noticed Davies’ swollen
hand, covered in cuts and scrapes.
Davies said he got the injuries while
working on a car and refused the med-
ical attention the friend advised, the afﬁ-
davit said.

About ten days after the fire,
Davies’ friend jokingly accused him of
setting the ﬁre. Davies told him he did,
according to the affidavit.

The 400—member church is rebuild-
ing the church sanctuary, the 30-foot
steeple and the damaged parts of the
school. About 90 students from ﬁrst to
12th grades attend Calvary Academy.

Calvary Baptist issued this state-
ment: “Calvary Baptist Church wishes
to continue and concentrate on their
busy ministries. The trial is a matter of
law and order. We choose to leave these
matters to the Attorney General’s ofﬁce
and the law enforcement department.”

The arson is not linked to the recent
rash of Western Pennsylvania church
arsons, ofﬁcials said.

United Nations clrug summit
ignores past mistakes

A message drummed into our
heads by high . school history

teachers and professors "is that

we’re supposed to learn from our
mistakes.

Evidently, world leaders
ignored this advice at the special
session of the United Nations
General Assembly dealing with
the international drug trade.

While promises and unrealis-
tic goals are just the sort of things
the electorate loves to hear, it does
not alleviate the international drug
problem. .

The sustained war on drugs in
the 1980s did not deliver a swift
and deadly blow to drug use and
trafﬁcking, but lead to steady
increases — in some cases, sharp
increases. For example, according
to the US. Drug Enforcement
Agency, there are three times as

many marijuana users today as”

there were in 1991.

Some of the pointless rhetoric
and useless promises at the inter-
national drug summit included:

A vague consensus to drasti-

cally reduce the demand for drugs

worldwide in 10 years; Pino
Arlacchi, who heads the U.N.’s
Drug Control Programme,
promising the worldwide elimina-
tion of the cocoa leaf and the
opium poppy, from which cocaine
and heroin are produced and

President Bill Clinton promising
$2 billion to be used to extend a
new advertising campaign through

_ 2002 for a propaganda blitz remi-

niscent of the failed “Just Say N 0”
campaign of the 1980s.

Countries with entrenched
dictatorships also took the oppor-
tunity to ask for assistance to deal
with their drug problems. The
Colombian Government used
U.S. ﬁnancial assistance to clamp
down on the notorious Cali drug
cartel, as well as any political ﬁg-
me who happened to disagree with

the government. Is it-any coinci-'

dence that the U.N. Drug Control
Programme has offices in Nigeria,
Afghanistan, Myanmar, Laos and
Peru, where concepts such as
democracy and human rights are
fantasy?

The Lindesmiﬂi Institute, a
group that prescribes the relax-

-ation and liberalization of drug

laws, has been trying to put its
views across at the drug summit to
no avail. Its biggest concern is that
tightening the noose and institut-
ing more legislation will make the
problem worse. .

The harder the Government
comes down on narcotics, the
harder the problem will be to com-
bat.

This is the lesson to be learned

ITHE SUN NEVER SETS ON UPMC

Violence not a viable answer ;

Whether from physics class or the night
they got drunk for the first time, many stu-
dents learn a lot when they come to college.
Thefe is different knowledge to be gained
from each experience, though. Just because
one accumulates knowledge does not neces-
sarily mean he understands it or can use it.
Life provides us with infinite situations to
remind us of that.

Take an event that occurred last summer.

when I was travelling. At a downtown bas-
ketball court, I witnessed two teenagers,
about 16 years old, playing one-on-one. One,
who we’ll call Mike, was quite drunk and
very unhappy that he bet his bus fare home
/on the game. Quite predictably,
Mike lost the game to the other
player, who we’ll call Tom.
That’s when the real trouble
began. Mike, who was whining
about how he had no money to get
home and how Tom was a jerk for taking his
money, wandered a little too close to Tom

and got shoved. Out of the blue, Torn went

nuclear on him. I realize that at 16 you react
differently to insults than you might six years
later, but Mike was drunk and no threat to
anyone but himself. But Torn started swear-
ing athim and declared he wanted to fight.

I think Mike realized things were out of
control and that he had made a mistake. He
made an effort to cool things down as Tom
stripped off his jacket and went into a
boxer’s stance, ﬁring punches in the air.
Then Tom slapped his hand away and sud-
denly pulled out a knife. He threatened to
stab Mike, claiming the knife had already
been used several times. Mind you, this was
the player who was not drunk. Tom eventu-
ally wound down and others rushed in, send-
ing both of them home. Who wants to play
with a guy who might stab you?

This was a case where I had all the infor-
mation but couldn’t understand it. Tom went
from winning a basketball game to nearly
stabbing his opponent, a person who was not
a threat and hadn’t blatantly insulted him.
This was the first time Tom and Mike had
met, so there was no history of bad blood.
Tom didn’t even try to talk things out, feel-
ing that for some reason his only option was
violence.

Not only do I not understand this men-
tality, I can’t even begin to comprehend it. I

know emotions hold more sway for
teenagers, but this went beyond a normal
teenage reaction. This was challenging a
drunk to a ﬁght for no real reason, even
though you know you’d beat him to a pulp.
Furthermore, why face jail time and ruin
your life for stabbing a drunk person?

The problem is that this is not an isolat-
ed incident. I’ve witnessed ﬁghts break out
time and time again, no matter what city I’ve
played in. Fists begin ﬂying over scores, in
cases where it’s just a matter of some ele-
mentary addition. People wind up choking
each other over some inadvertent foul. The
game simply isn’t fun anymore when you
have to wonder whether your
opponent might take a swing or a
stab at you out of frustration.

Animosity is something that
naturally builds up between oppo-
nents, especially in sports with
physical contact. And if you’ve ever played
in the low post going for a rebound, with
elbows ﬂying and some guy climbing your
back, you know it can be war. But it’s sup-
posed to end with the whistle or the action. If
I could build a house with all my bricks, put
out an APB for my defense, or am frustrated
over a lack of teamwork, is my opponent to
blame for it? How is hitting him going to
help matters?

If somebody has problems with violence
on the basketball court, how do they handle
real problems elsewhere, with other people?
Is violence the only option there as well?
Where does it end? I realize I bring a white,
suburban outlook to all of this, but it seems
there have to be better alternatives to always
ﬁghting or potentially being in trouble with
the law.

Maybe that’s the problem. Maybe I just
don’t understand what everyone else is
bringing to the table, that perhaps there’s
some code that allows for any issue to be
resolved with violence. But to me, it’s just
sad that a 16-year-old kid feels like poten-
tially ruining his life over something as sim-
ple as basketball. It becomes tragic when one
considers violence could be the only option
for a generation of inner-city youth.

Andrew Miller wonders how you’re sup-
posed to ﬁx or help what you don ’t under-
stand.

Wrnursmv, 10 ]um; 1998

J. Gielata

columnist

I couldn’t help but smirk upon hearing
a few weeks ago of certain men who had
died due to complications involving Viagra.
You probably know that Viagra is the rnira-
cle pill for men with waning wieners, and it

appears to be genuinely effective, unlike

such quack pills as Tocopheral (Would you

like the sex power of a bull?), so frequently

advertised in various smut mags. Anyway,
the report of Viagra-related deaths called to
mind the common urge to overdo a good
thing. Some men must have thought to

I themselves: “Well, if just one pill has this

effect, then imagine what ﬁve pills would
do! I could be the next John Holmes!” And
I wondered if any doctors shook their heads
as they wrote “Viagra OD” on death certiﬁ-
cates. There are more embarrassing ways to
die — a few, at least. Presumably, it would-
n’t be the ﬁrst time people died for the sake
of sex.

I’d say the most obvious human
impulse is hunger. Sex is next. In my mind,

, not enough has been said concerning the
I connection between the two. For instance,

the language of sex is dotted with food ref-

 erences —— we talk about “eating someone

THE Pin Nrws

In defense of the sexually underpriveleged

out” and joke about the game of “hide the
salami.” Furthermore, the two activities are
remarkably similar”. all the licking and suck-
ing seem almost like vain attempts to eat
ﬂesh. In fact, it surprises me that we so infre-
quently hear about incidents of cannibalism,
given the similarity of the two appetites.
Some time ago, I wondered why the
hunger strike was such a common form of
protest, though the sex strike was virtually
unheard of. One suffers whether starving for
food or starving for sex, and the protest is
somehow connected to the suﬂering, I ﬁg-
ured. Recalling my New Year’s resolution to
“ rforrn at least one noble deed” I cleverly
decided that a sex strike would adequately
fulﬁll my quota. So far as I could tell, a gen-
uine hunger strike had to be associated with
some cause, otherwise it was ordinarily
called a diet (this observation raised an etlri-
cal concern: is it OK for a hunger-striker to
take hunger-suppression pills? Probably
not, since, like I said, the protest and pain are
connected in some way). _
,1 Choosing .a cause was easier than I
thought it would be. The main criterion for
a noble cause is that it be subjective instead
of objective; the question to ask is not “Do
my actions in fact aifect a situation for the
better?” but rather, “Does it make me feel

good to think that my efforts are better-
intentioned than anyone else’s?” “With this in
mind, I decided on “social justice” as my
cause -— the vaguer the cause, the better.

. Feeling more noble than usual, I
embarked on my sex strike. I expected some
cold critic to point out that my life was pro-
ceeding in no discernibly different way, to
whom I would reply, “Yes, but now my suf-
fering is focused on a noble intention — my
previously idle pains now reach out from
my mind into the world” The same cold
critic, that bitter skeptic, might have sug-
gested that my cause bordered on nonsense.

Well in that case, I did have a particular
and appropriate form of social justice in
mind. Egalitarians of all kinds have long
complained about material inequality (call-
ing it “inequity” with a slick categorical
hop), yet have failed to address sexual
inequality. However, it is just as clear to me
that the distribution of sex in this country is
unequal. One need only consider the case of
the successful rock star, that robber baron of
the sexual world, to recognize this inequali-
ty. From inequality, it only takes the con-_
struction of an ideal ——- e.g. that every per-
son should get laid daily — to yield an
inequity. “So it is the vast sexual inequity in
the world against which my sex strike is a

protest,” I would have replied to the mean-
spirited skeptic.

Whilst enduring the sex strike, I had the
opportunity to contemplate the origins of
sexual inequity. There is, of course, the gen-
eral prudishness for which contemporary
watered-down Christianity — Christ Lite
— is to blame. The thrust of that ideology is
that sex outside rigidly deﬁned circum-
stances is patently bad; some reckless nooky
will probably earn you some time in purga-
tory, maybe a m‘enage ‘a trois will get you
to hell (don’t quote me on the specifics).
Then there are the “AIDS is the Black
Death” crisis-mongers who have inspired
new heights of self-righteousness (“where’s
your red ribbon, you reactionary?!”) and
who have spread enough disinformation to
keep many of us sexually deprived for years
to conre. Both inﬂuences, as well as others,
have contributed to the emergence of a vast
class of sexually underprivileged people.

My sex strike has been over for some
time now, but I encourage others to adopt
such forms of resistance to protest what is a
sorry, unbearable and inhumane situation.

J. Gielata wonders whether eﬁorts to redis-
tribute sex will result in long lines anal sex
shortages.

  Something good to be found in the trash

Dave Madden

Columnist

; “If this is what daytime TV talk
I shows have become, I’m gladl got
 out of them when I did.” —

Geraldo Rivera

Sorry that’s not an exact
quote, but it’s exact enough to get

(me started. As if there weren’t
enough critics of daytime talk

shows, now we’ve got Geraldo,

' the man responsible for the “trash

TV” phenomenon, riding on the
foreﬁont of them. The problem

V with Geraldo (well, we all know

there is no one problem with
Geraldo) and all other critics of this
TV genre is that they can’t seem to
ﬁnd anything inherently good in
these shows. Luckily for you, dear
reader, I can.

To begin, let’s take the grand
pooh-ba of trash TV — Jerry

I Springer. Everyone knows the for-

mula for a Springer show: some
sort of “secret” lover (preferably of
a scandalous gender or sexual ori-
entation), an angry Mullet-haired
brother, and the collision of the two
rnid-stage with ﬁsts ﬂying and tufts
of hair carpeting the stage.

Critics of trash TV end their
analysis of the show here. They see
the ﬁghts on stage, they see their
children ﬁght, they put two and
two together. Jerry Spdnger, they

say, promotes ﬁghting to get rid of
his guests’ problems. This is obvi-
ously not true, , since when
Springer’s guests come on their
show they’re given a list of rules to
follow, one of ‘them being “No
Fighting.” The folks at “Springer”
realized they’d get more ratings if
they didn’t cut out the ﬁghts, and
the guests see this and ‘
feel compelled to ﬁght
when they get on the
show. Is this promot-
ing violence? Well,
maybe, but TV’s a
business, folks, and
look who’s rolling in
the dough.

But you and I
both know that ﬁghts
aside, there is just so
much more to the
average “Springer”
show worth mention-
ing. There are the hair- 
dos, which could only * *
come out of the vivid ' ' 'on
of the Heartland, the conespond-
ing clothes (which are even funnier
once you realize they were proba-
bly bought and chosen by the
guests to wear speciﬁcally for the
show), and the deliciously wicked
smack—talking (my favorite being
“bitch” and the inﬁnite uses and
variations thereof).

The interesting thing is, take
away the ﬁghts am the swearing,

 

   
 

kid is? .

and you have the majority of other
talk shows out there. A recent
episode of “Jermy Jones” (who’s
slowly becoming the thin Ricki
Lake) dealt with paternity tests, all
subjects looking very hideous with
pretty messed-up lives. I mean,
come on, you don’t even know
who the father of your 6-year-old

   

But before you take away the
ﬁghts to compare “Springer” to
other talk shows, don’t forget the
historical bout with Neo-Nazis
which garnered Geraldo a broken
nose. This is not a new phenome-
non.

The majority of trash TV
shows deal with the same inbred
people, same horriﬁcally large
hairdos and same laughable prob-

lems. This is where the genre
shows its true colors. Where else
on television can we get more of a
moral lesson than here? Nowhere,
really. The wonderfully innovative

thing about tr'ashTVisthatit does: ’
n’t bother showing us how we

should act — they leave that to
 “Family  and
“Sesame Street.”
Instead, they provide
the populace with the
lowest common
denominator of ethics
and moral behavior
to show us how not to
act.

I’ve never
watched a single
episode of “Springer ’
or“Ricki”or“Jenn ”
or anyone without
feeling a sort of self-
pride in how well
put—together my life
-  is. Unless the show is
sonre boring topic like “Dream
Makeovers” or “We Reunite
Former Friends,” I always sit in the
safe haven of my living room and
say to myself, “Well Dave, at least
you’re not one of those people —-
think how bad that would suc ” I
haven’t gotten anyone pregnant,
haven’t fallen in love with a man
who I could have sworn was a
woman, and haven’t been involved
in any secret love triangles.

Having watched hours and
hours of “Springer” (yes, I and 10
or so ﬁiends all pitched in for the
“Too Hot for TV!” video), I have a
clear idea of what not to become
and how not to beconre it. ’It’s very
similar to the scandalous “real-
ness” of l994’s Kids . After seeing
that movie, ﬁlled with kids doing
drugs and having all sorts of sex
(who eventually pay the conse-
quences), do you think I’ll have
randomunprotected sex? No way,
padre. That movie scared me more
than Sleepaway Camp ever could.

You think I’ll 11111 off and
marry a transvestite or place
myself in a dog-like dornirrant/sub-
rnissive relationship now," after
seeing so much informative trash
TV? No way. This is how we need”
to handle trash TV, because it’s not
going away. Enjoy the jokes it’s
trying to tell and play along with
the way it exploits and makes fun
of these people who are all so very
willing to share how they have
steered their lives into thisla11gh-
ably bizarre brick wall.

Unless you’ve done the same
thing to yourself. In that case, get

yourself on a TV show right now, »

please.

Song, art and food—OI| my.

By ISADORA MURPHY of Fuji ﬁlm and a prayer that the wild  and
roaring lions won't notice him.

Wildlife photographer Mark Thomas embarks In comparison, arts festivals are rather tame. But
on his average expedition armed with 400 to 5(X) rolls they do provide a rovin venue for the display and

. sale of Thomas’ piotographs, providing an
income to fund his new adventures.

Thomas received one of only 165 spots assigned
to the 775 applicants for the 39th annual Three
Rivers Arts Festival, which promises to live up to
past festivals.

Though the festival opened under the typical
torrents of rain, an estimated 600,0(I) attendees are
expected to come out in the next two weeks,
through June 20, to experience the booms in
Gateway Plaza, tour the KDKA studios and
watch live performances in Point State Park.

If Thomas’ booth is doing average business, the
festival is already a hit. His business is booming.
After on] one weekend at his first art show in
Pittsb he already wants to do next year's.

Part of ' success at festivals is due to the wide
variety of his photographs’ subjects —— blue ice-
bergs in Antarctica, tropical ﬁsh from the depths of
the sea and the scarred face of an old lion in Africa.

The vast presentation will captivate all ages, strik-
ing both adults and children with the intensity of
images.

When you look at the pictures of this talented
photographer, who captured ﬂre conﬁdent eyes of
the bald eagle, it’ s hard to believe he first picked
up a camera when he was 23 and that he never
had any formal education in photography.

”Funny how things just work out that way. It was

Another acclaimed photographer, Martha Rial,
recipient of the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for photojournal-
ism, will grace the festival with her winnin series,
”Trek of Tears,” displayed in the lobby of e USX
Tower.

Photography is just one highlight at the art show.
The festival sponsors all mediums of art work, includ-
ing singing, paintings, caricatures and sculpting.

Robert Hasselle, a sculptor from Cincinnati, cred-
ited both education and talent for the intriguing
"Fragmented Torsos” he makes from bronze.

l/Vrth his shop, Design Art Gallery, rooted in Ohio,
Hasselle still enjoys coming to the festival.

"l’ve been here several times,” said Hasselle. ”I’m
doing p good. Big cities do a little better."

For Jo Barry, a whistle-maker from New York,
his booth is his only shop.

”This is my portable store,” said Barry. ”It goes
everywhere from Vermont to New Mexico.”

Other attractions at the festival appeal to a range
of senses. It’s hard to escape the smell of popcorn,
candy apples, cheese steak and hot dogs.

With a full stomach, the crowds can see bands
perform live in Point State Park A series of rock, coun-
try and jazz artists are scheduled to perform.

To escape the cold weather, take a 15-minute
tour, exclusive to the festival, of KDKA news and radio

The old Dylan still rocks
By JAKE WOMER

Time magazine recently named Bob Dylan the most
inﬂuential folk musician of the century, and he won this
year's Grammy Award for Album of the Year with Time
Out of Mind. So the time is ripe for a week-long
engagement of D. A. Pennebaker’s Don ’t Look Back at at
Pittsburgh Filmmakers’ Melwood Screening Room.

Shot during three and a half weeks of Dylan's 1965
tour of England, the 1967 documentary reveals the
rugged-voiced, spontaneous 23-year-old to a younger
audience that missed him in his youth.

Th ning sequ nce sets a care-free atmosphere

' ““    " " ‘E with Dylan nonchalantly
ﬂipping through a stack of
 cue cards in an alley while
Allen Ginsberg lingers in
the background to the
 tune of ”Subterranean
Homesick Blues.”

E Of course, Dylan's mum-
 bling isn’t tailor-made for
 a ﬁlm. But Pennebaker’s
Bob Dylan is fol- ﬂy—on—the-wall approach catches
lowed  a camera   a  II100d 
with his friends, confounding an
English joumalist and digesting the
press. He mixes  with concert
footage. It’ s a refreshingly ribald por-
trait of a captivating poet that was her-
alded as the voice of a generation.
And ironically, the ﬁlm shows
Dylan refusing to explain why he is not a folk musician in
a hilarious discourse with a peeved Time magazine
reporter. Dylan won't explain himself, but he maintains his
position without the beneﬁt of logic. It’ s a beautiful thing.

a documentary of sorts about the fall of
the disco era and the rise of the decade
Michael Jackson built, then take off your

very early 80s is simply the backdrop for
this smart comedy, peppered with
humorously philosophical discussions
about Disney’ s Lady and the Tramp and
what exactly constitutes the loss of one’s
Virginity-

The new movie follows friends Alice
(Chloe Sevigny) and Charlotte (Kate Beckinsale)
through their double life: co-workers at a publish-
ing company during the day and regulars at an
unnamed Studio 54-like club in Manhattan at
night. That’ s about it for plot. Dialogue carries this
ﬂick with rhetorical conversations between Alice,

fates as yuppies. L o L

BY D. SUMMERS

If the music critics ever found a
way to pin down Beck as either a folkie,
a hip-hop maven, a psychedelic popster
or all three genres rolled into one, they
would be writing obituaries by now.

It’ s a major sport among rock
scribes to pigeonhole artists into a
genre, but they can't actually corral
Beck's sound. His evasion of the fences
and restraints makes him a major fave
among music writers and fans.

Pittsburgh will certainly have a
chance to see the one-narned wun-
derkind when he comes to Coca-Cola
Star Lake Amphitheatre in support of
his newest multi-platinum album,
Odelay. When you catch him live, four

words come to mind — never a dull

. moment.

A live Beck show is full of humor
and strong live material, as well as other
surprises. Hopping along for the
Pittsburgh stop will be southem-fried
piano geeks Ben Folds Five, who
breathe the spirit of ’70’ s angst and
Todd Rundgren into their gold-selling
Epic debut, Whatever and Ever, Amen.

It’ s that all-over-the-place musical
mentality that makes Beck a revered
modern rock artist on the radio and
with the fans.

Spin recently named him as the
most vital artist of the '90s, beating out
the likes of Radiohead and Alanis
Morrissette. .

Odelay, released in 1997, won two
Grammy Awards and spawned several
hits including: ”Where It’ s At,” ”Devil’s
Haircut,” ”The New Pollution,” and

”]ackass.”

Tl-IE. Pin News

Between his major label debut,
Mellow Gold (of ”Lose1” fame) and
Odelay, Beck released the more esoteric
One Foot In The Grave for K Records.
Stripped of its pop sheen and consid-
ered a knuckler when everyone was
expecting a sequel to Gold, Ol-"IT G
became a serious fave among Beck fans
and college radio.

Adding to the success of Odelay,
his most recent song, "Deadweight/’
from the A Life Less Ordinary sound-
track, was nominated for an MTV
Movie Award for Best Song from a
movie. 1997 has been a very good year
for Beck Hansen (no relation to the three
mop—tops from Tulsa).

Of course, we've all heard some-
thing about his beginnings. His mother
is an artist who was a fringe hanger-on
in Andy Warhol's Factory, his father
was a jazz musician.

He had a bohemian upbringing in
Los Angeles, where he listened to near-
ly anything in sight. He started playing
in the Coffeehouses of L.A. and released
his own eclectic material on a small
label, garnering a following among the
local cappuccino and espresso set.

Soon, inﬂuential alternative station
KROQ entered the mix. It was their
push that led to a label-bidding war for
Beck, with Geffen winning out and
unleashing ”Lose1”. And of course, we
all know the success Beck earned with
Mellow Gold.

With the 1997 success, Beck shed
the tag ”one-hit wonder” from his
resmne and has become a stylish inno-
vator for the '90s. Attend his concert
tonight, you'll deﬁnitely have a story
worth telling the andkids

The NHL needs to
shape up

Just a few years ago, Mario Lernieux,
the all-world center of the Pittsburgh
Penguins, called the National Hockey‘
League a “Garage League.”

Lernieux received a great deal of crit-
icism for this remark from the media, fans
and the league, in addition to a ﬁne and a
stern warning from Gary Betteman, bas-
ketball guru turned hockey chump-er,
commissioner.

Lernieux was actually right when he

' . said this, but nobody realized it.

The NHL has become a sad league
that will not promote its talent or let the
fans enjoy the most skilled game on Earth.

Hockey integrates the brute force of
football with the ﬁnesse of soccer. It puts
the strategy of baseball together with the
skill of lacrosse. It incorporates the excite-
ment of basketball with the power of
wrestling.-

The list goes on and on. Hockey play-
ers not only have to be tough, but they
must have tremendous skating ability and
adeptness. They must do things on skates
that many people carmot do on their feet.

Real hockey fans remember the days
of John Ziegler as the commissioner. He
was not liked by many fans, but at least he
let hockey be the game it should be.

Hockey was fast paced and exciting.

A It let its superstars play the game and it let

the fans ‘enjoy the superstars.

Then came Gary Betteman. The NHL
lured him away from the NBA. This is a
man who knew nothing about hockey, but
as usual, the league decided it needed to
make money and become prosperous. In
attempting to do so, the NHL lost many of

' its fans.

Betteman tried to make the game
more welcome to people who had never
watched hockey before.

Fox began broadcasting the games
and gave new fans the “Glow Puck.” This
wonderful invention made the game easi-

' er to follow for the person who knew noth-

ing about hockey, but for the fans of many
years, the glow was distracting to them
and made the game frustrating and hard to

‘ watch.

The problem does not end with
Betteman, though. Brian Burke, the NHL
Director of Oﬂicials, has also done a great
job to degrade the game. Each year, under
Burke’s leadership, ﬂie league says it will
eliminate clutching and grabbing.

This is a phenomenon unique to the
NHL where defensemen grab, hold and
jump on their opponents’ backs to prevent
them from playing the game. This elimi-
nates offense and has given rise to the
wonderfully exciting (BIG YAWN) neu-

Sinﬁh and Ear-Tlurn in
All-American performances

Mark O'Connor
Staff Wrlter

The 1998 NCAA Division I Outdoor
Track and Field Championships has once
again proven to be a showcase event for the
University of Pittsburgh’s women’s team in
general, and Trecia Smith in particular.

Propelled by Srnitl1’s ﬁrst place ﬁnish in
the triple jump, her second place ﬁnish in the
long jump and a fourth place ﬁnish for team-

mate Chantee,Earl in the 800—meter ﬁnal,

Pitt racked up 23 points to place 12th
in the nation. Of all the Division I
teams entered, only 65 scored any :
points at all. Texas won the_ H
Championship with 60 points.

This year’s Championship, held at
State University of New York at

with a national stage on which to close
out its 1997-98 track season, and
Smith with a way to ﬁnish her junior
year in spectacular fashion.

Smith, a native of Jamaica, contin-
ues to improve with each season andis
undoubtedly destined for the 2000
Olympic Games. Her winning triple
jump distance of 13.98 meters was just 

shy of her collegiate best mark of If

14.22 meters, set on May 25 of last
Yeaﬁ « 5

When asked about the weather
conditions for the outdoor champi-
onships, Head Coach Steve Lewis
said, “In a word, brutal. The wind, the

- cold, the faci1ities...but the conditions were

the same for all the athletes. All the athletes
in all the events were outstanding.”

Lewis enthusiastically added, “But
Trecia Smith and Chantee Earl showed the
hearts of warriors with their efforts and
 It’s this eﬂort and hard
workdayafterdaythatmakesthemAll-
Americans and champions.”

Finishing behind Smith in the Triple
Jump were Stacey Bowers, a junior. from
Baylor who earned second place with a

mark of 13.62. Nicole Gamble, a North

    

Carolina junior, garnered third place with a
jump of 13.40. Fourth place went to UCLA
sophomore Deana Simmons, who posted a
mark of 13.20.‘

In the Long Jump, Smith placed second 5‘

behind Angie Brown of George Mason.
Also a junior, Brown jumped 6.59 meters,

‘while Smith jumped 6.42 meters. Rounding

out the ﬁeld was Jenny Adams,‘ a sophomore
ﬁom Houston. 1 Her jump of 6.31 meters
earned her third place. .

Pitt’s Chantee Earl culminated her spec-

tacular sophomore season by placing fourth
in the 800-meter ﬁnal. Originally from
Hampton, Va, Earl’s time of 2:04.61 was
just off thepaceof thethethreewomen who
ﬁnished above her. Hazel Clark, a junior
from Florida, won the race with a new
Buffalo Stadium record time of 2:02.16. The
previous mark was 2:03.72, set by Amy
VV1ckus on July 18, 1993. “

Second place in the event went to South
Carolina’s senior Charmaine Howell, who
posted a time of 2:03.66, which also bettered
the standard set by Vlfrckus.

Tame ’“’!i..g

The results of this year’s Outdoor Track
and Field Championships are a ﬁtting cap to
another successful season for Lewis and his
dedicated staff. In his 14th year at the
University of Pittsburgh, Lewis continually
ﬁelds world-class scholar-athletes and teams

that keep Pitt among the elite in collegiate

track and ﬁeld.

Lewis was euphoric as he recapped the
events of the previous week and the accom-
plishments of his students. “People don’t
realize how difficult it is to succeed at this
level,” he said “It’s the 17 best athletes
in each event from around the country.
Then only the top-eight of those
become All-Americans. It’s very
tough.”

- Pitt’s men’s and women’s track
and ﬁeld teams have regularly produced
world class student-athletes. On the
men’s side, Lewis has recently coached
Lee McRae, the All—American dash
specialist who established both indoor
and outdoor track records.

Lewis and his staff also recently
coached a record-setting 800-meter
"’ relay team, and in 1995 he coached the
., team to indoor and outdoor records.
And it stands as a tribute to the coach-
ing staff when considered that most of
the record-setters were also football
players. For Lewis to harness the raw
potential of these athletes speaks for
.1, itself.

Curtis Anderson, Anthony Dorsett,

' Detrich Jells and Jay Jones teamed up
for an outdoor mark of 1:23.96. For the
indoor event Jay Murphy ran ir1 place of
Dorsett,andtheteampostedatimeof
1:27.00.

On the women’s team, Trecia Smith and
Chantee Earl need only look to last season,
when senior Najurna Fletcher, a 14-time All-
American, led the squad Fletcher excelled
and set records in the Pentathalon, High
Jump, Long Jump and Triple Jump.

The future looks bright for the
University of Pittsburgh’s track and ﬁeld
teams.

Zacharlah Blott
Staff Wrlter

Oliver Antigua, recently a play-

er/manager for Pitt’s basketball team,

has been named the new third-assistant
coach at Pitt.

Antigua, 22, graduated from Pitt
this past spring with a bachelor’s
degree in sociology. He succeeds Vince
Taylor, who recently joined the
University of Wyoming as its chief
assistant coach. 6

“We’re very pleased to add Oliver
Antigua to our basketball sta ,” said
Pitt Head Coach Ralph Willard.
“Oliver has been an integral part of our
program the past four years as a player
and manager. He has shown outstand-
ing work ethic and leadership abili-
ties.”

Antigua served Pitt as a team man-
ager from 1993-98, the last four years
as head manager. He assumed the addi-
tional role of player during the 1994-95
and 1997-98 seasons when the

oops assistant

Panthers’ roster was depleted due to
injuries. Antigua dressed for all 27
games this past season and made
appearances in four of those.

Although a native of the Bronx,
N.Y., Antigua is one of three brothers
who have basketball ties to the city of
Pittsburgh. His older brother, Orlando,
was a Panther standout from 1991-95
and is currently a member of the
Harlem Globetrotters. His younger
brother, Omar, was a basketball letter-
man at Carnegie Mellon University

Swim team announces new

recruits for next season

Joe Carmody

For The Pitt News

The men’s swirmning and diving team
looks to continue its winning tradition,
armouncing its incoming class for the 1998-
99 season.

“There was quite a bit of pressure to
bring in a strong freshmen squad this season
because of the number of Big East
Conference points we lost to graduation,”
said Head Coach Chuck Knoles, who will
begin his ninth season at Pittsburgh this fall.

“We graduated Jonathan Haggerty, a
six-time conference champion; Eric
Stefanski, our school record—holder in the
100- and 200-meter freestyle events; Peter
Hezky, a l2-time conference ﬁnalist; and
Bob Nooning, a perennial conference ﬁnal-
ist,” said Knoles.

“But I think next year’s freshman class
will be able to step in and contribute to our
history of success and will be able to com-
plement the strengths of the team members
we have returning,” added Knoles.

Heading up the Panthers incoming
freshmen class will be a slew of steady and
developing talent.

Local swimmer Michael Demos from
Elizabeth Forward High School, who was
recently named a WPLAL Scholar Athlete,
will join Pittsburgh next season. Demos
gained the national Junior Championship
(Northeast) sprint title when he won the 50-
meter freestyle this past spring in a blister-
ing 20.62 at the new Goodwill Games pool
in Lond Island, NY. In addition to being a
ﬁve—time WPIAL champion, he was also
named the Pennsylvania State Champion in
the 50 freestyle in 1997. »

“Pittsburgh is a seed for everything I
want in a school,” Demos said. “I’m look-
ing forward to getting started and working
with Coach Knoles.”

Demos, who will major in Business
Administration next fall, follows in his fam-
ily’s footsteps by attendingPitt. His father is
an alumni and his brother is a pre—med stu-
dent.

Helping to lead the talent pool at
Pittsburgh next season will be the 6—foot-4»
inch Colorado High School Swimmer of
the Year Jeremiah “Miah” Heath. Heath
(Estes Park HS, Estes Park, Co.) was a four-
time Colorado state champion in the 50

t ..a.n¢xattz_—1,~.~-rl->. A:~it-I

freestyle and the l00—meter butterﬂy.

Adding to Knoles’ collection of State
Champion swimmers will be a pair of
Arizona swimmers, Guy “W111” Eden and
Ryan Rahaeuser, both from Chaparral HS in
Scottsdale, Ariz.

Eden ‘was the Arizona State
Champion in the 200-meter individual med-
ley and the 100-meter backstroke events.
Eden, a high school honors student, also
qualiﬁed for the U.S. National
Championships this summer in the 200
backstroke. Knoles predicts Eden can be a
contributor at Pittsburgh in almost any event
he desires. T

Rahaeuser took the Arizona State
high—school title in the 100 butterﬂy, and
was the captain of his high school team,
which won the Arizona team championship
this past year. ,

Mexican swimmer Adrian Figueroa
(Colegio Cervantes, Guadalajara, Mexico)
has signed and will shore up the Panther
depth in the butterﬂy events.

The Panthers also snagged the Indiana
High School State Champion in the 100
breaststroke ir1 Matt Gouwens (Highland
HS, Highland IN.)

From Florida, Eric vonDohlen
(Oveido, HS, Oveido, Fla.) will join the
Panthers as an incoming freshman.

Pittsburgh has “also received a commit-
ment from Joshua Quinn (Orchard Park HS,
Hamburg N.Y.), a volleyball player and
swimmer who Knoles thinks is a genuine
ﬁnd.

Incoming divers to Pittsburgh will be
Pennsylvania athletes Michael Wells
G)owningtown HS, Downingtown, PA),
Blair Beal (Woodland Hills HS, Pittsburgh,
Pa.) and Michael Pavetto (Penn Trafford
HS, Harrison City, Pa.)

Last season the Panthers won their
13th Conference Championship. It was
Knoles’ 5th Conference title as head coach,
and he was also named Big East Coach of
the Year for the 4th time.

“This next season should be a growing
one for our Pittsburgh men. We have
stepped up our competitive schedule and
will be taking on national powers
Minnesota, North Carolina, Indiana,
Missouri and Ohio State. It should be a Very
challenging and exciting year for the guys!”
said Knoles.

tral zone trap that even the Penguins have
begun to use.

Every year, the league says it will
change the rules allowing clutching and
grabbing. It works for about a month or so,
but when the season comes to an end, the
only time games really matter in the NHL,
there are no holding calls to be seen.

For example, this year after the
Olympic break the almighty leaders of the
league decided they would call obstruction
penalties. All of us crazy fans thought this
would last into the playoffs and we would
once again see exciting hockey, but we
were disappointed by the disappearance of
these penalties in the end; For those of you
who can stand to watch the joke they call
the NHL playoffs, there have been mini-
mal, if any, obstruction calls. Once again,
our hopes were out the window.

The NHL also has a problem with
inconsistent referees. The officials will call
a very close game through two periods, but
then an amazing phenomenon that has
come to be known as “Swallowing the
Whistle” occurs. The referee will let any-
thing go and not call any penalties during
the second half of the game.

This was accepted in the NHL for
years, and the players expected it. Now, in

FROM PAGE 12

.the last few years, the officials only half

swallow their whistle. They allow a lot to
go on, but then they get bored and decide
they need to call a penalty every once in a
while.

In the playoffs two years ago, the
Penguins were playing the Washington
Capitals, who are in the ﬁnals this year.
What a joke that is. They have no talent and
are not exciting at all.

During one particular series the Caps
played in this year, Don Koharski, an NHL
veteran official, had one of his worst days
ever. He has never really done his job well,
but the Sabres—Caps game six will be

remembered for a long time.

In the third period, he awarded a
ridiculous power play to the Capitals who
had a very tough time at the beginning of
the game. In the third, the Sabres had two
odd-man rushes against the Capitals’ ﬂoun-
dering defense. Washington thwarted both
rushes by blatantly pulling down Sabres on
their way to the goal cage.

These actions by the Capitals would be
considered assault and battery in any other
part of American society, but Koharski did
not think they warranted a penalty.

Just seconds after the bogus non-calls,
the Capitals scored on the power play and
earned their ﬁrst ever trip to the Stanley
Cup Finals. They should give a ring to Don
Koharski if they do win the Cup.

In the immortal words of Jim
Schoenfeld, “Hey Koharski, you fat pig.
Go eat another donut.” This is what the
game is coming to. Mediocre teams okay
for the most coveted and tradition—1aden
trophy in sports.

The NHL has alienated fans, but it has
also lost the support of the players.
Lernieux, one of the best players of all time,
left the sport, citing the officiating and the
lack of excitement in the game as reasons
for leaving. He says he has not watched a
game on TV since he retired because it is so
boring.

Also, Brett Hull torched league oili-
cials with his comments earlier this year
about how boring the league has become.

Betteman and the NHL have a perfect
chance to take the spotlight with Michael
Jordan apparently leaving basketball along
with that sport’s imminent trouble. The
league should get its act together in order to
gain the notoriety it so desperately wants.

Patrick Robertson is the sports editor
for the Pitt News and doesn’t say these
things only because he is a Penguins ’ fan.
he really wants to see hockey step into the
spotlight so that everyone can see what a
great sport it is.

New bowl system
announced

The Bowl Championship Series, or
the entity formerly known as the Bowl
Alliance, has announced its plans for
the 1998 bowl lineup.

It will use the Associated Press and
ESPN/U SA Today polls in conjunction
with an objective entity which will take
into account strength of schedule and
strength of opponents’ schedule to
decide who should play in the national
championship game of college football.

This new system still leaves ques-
tions with regards to more than two
undefeated teams, zero undefeated
teams, or the possibility of several
teams with one only loss. ‘

The new bowl lineups and BCS
guidelines should be released soon, so
look to The Pitt News in the coming
weeks to help you sort through the
muddled bowl picture.

KQV acquires
radio rights

The University of Pittsburgh has
given the radio broadcast rights of foot-
ball games and men’s basketball games
this fall to KQV—AM (1410).

KQV lured the rights away from
WTAE (1250), who has held them for
the past 28 years.

WTAE also lost the rights to broad-
cast Pittsburgh Penguins games this
year, just a few months after changing
to an all—sports format. WTAE is
scrambling to get the rights for some
local sports.

Bill Hillgrove will keep his job as
play-by—play man for the football and
basketball teams while negotiations are
underway for his color man.

KQV is owned by Pinnacle Sports
Productions, an Omaha, Neb. based
company that also holds the rights to
University of Nebraska games.
