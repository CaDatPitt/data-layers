’(FAS) budget cuts calling for reduc-
tions in the advising center, depart-
ment advisors, and teaching
assistants have been leveled
although entire consequences of the
cuts have not yet been determined.
according to FAS Dean Jerome
Rosenberg. 

The university is requiring FAS
and other university departments to
cut $850,000 from their budgets for
fiscal year l982. Rosenberg said he
has reached a final decision on the
advising center and the number of
undergraduate advisers will be cut
from 35 to 20 for FY I982’.

“Don't tell me aboutiAmerica,”
shouted Karl Marzani to an Ameri-

can Communist Party member, “l”

fought under the American flag in

World War ll and lispit on it now." V

Such was the tension that ran high
at Wednesday night's discussion on
Marzani’s new book, The Promise
of Eurocomunism, in Forbes Quad-
rangle. Marzani is a veteran of the

majorityof major political uphea-'

vals in Europe this century.
At‘ Wednesday night’s sympo-

sium, the hard-nosed and vivacious .

69-year-old confronted much of
ideological confrontation from var-
ious leftist leaders from the Pitts-
burgh area. '

“The simple fact of the matter is
that the communism of Russia
doesn’t work, and the capitalism of
the U.S. doesn't work either,” Mar-
zani told an audience comprised
primarily of local students.

He believes that the United States
will soon see the merging ofcomrnu-
nism and democracy his native ltaly
isinow experiencing. In a peaceful

and democratic fashion, he sees the ‘

marriageibetween the two inevita-
ble, and this is the subject ‘of his
book. '

“l’ve seen it and it works," he said.
And Karl Marzani has seen a great
deal.

He was an actor in the great social
dramas now a part oftoday’s history
texts. Fleeing Mussolini’s l-taly with

his family, he fought with the Anar- '

achist Brigade in the'Spanish Civil

_ War, and was imprisoned in the U.S.

Carl Marzani was born in Rome
in l9l2 to an anti-fascist family, and
wound up in the United Sfates as
the first political prisoner of the
Cold War. In I981 he continues to
surge ahead with his Marxist beliefs,
writing. teaching, speaking and
debating in his adament way, and
stopping to do an interview. At 69,

the “old war horse,” as he calls him--

self, is still going strong.

The delivery of this colorful man
with an adventurist past is marked
by an emotional sincerity, and he is
tough, engaging and disarming at
the same time. There‘s no bullshit
about Carl Marzani.

What Marzani fears most is
nuclear war, but what pleases him
most is that the dream of Marxism
he has fought for, from the Anar-
chist Brigades in Spain to New
York's Lower East Side, is bearing
‘healthy fruit in his native land,
which he visited in 1978 to write his
latest book, “The Promise of Euro-
communism.”

“Socialists ancf‘Communists have
all the major municipal govern-
ments,” he is proud to say. “All the
major cities, Venice, Rome, all are
under Communist domination. 60
percent -of the population of Italy is
governed locally by the Left.”

Marzani said there is a miscon-
ception about the Communists’ loss
of power, when they dropped from
34 percent of the vote in 1976 to 31
percent in I979.

“Everyone said they’re finished,
which is nonsense. What happened
was half the youth moved away in‘
‘79, disillusioned because unemploy-
ment hadn’t changed and» because
they expected more. But they went

hungry and cold and tired, that he
discovered what was going on.

“The man atthe desk said, ‘Oh, i

you want to join the army. What’s
your name?’ That was my introduc-
tion to the army.” But during a stop-
over in Monseurat, a stronghold of
the anarchists, where he was wined

the famous Durruti Column, which
had stopped twelve miles outside of
Saragosa, a key fascist setronghold.
He asked the ambulance driver why
‘they had stopped. ‘“Because we were

' tired,‘ he said." Marzani said he is

convinced “the Spanish Civil War
was lost in the -first few weeks
because the Anarchists had a lack of
supervision.”

Marzani admits that “anarchism
"as a political movement is absolutely
dead.” However, “Anarchist ideal-
ism is very much alive. When you
say ‘That government is best which

governs least,‘ that_ is absolutely

American. It is a profound reson-

to the department oftheir major. In
the fall of I982, all sophomores will
be transferred to the department
they have expressed some interest in,
while students undecided about a
major will stay with the advising
center.

Ifthe decision to reduct the advis-
ing center is held to, faculty advisors
will then be required to hold office
hours for advising in the advising
center of the ninth floor of the
Cathedral, Koloc added.

“For the faculty to do thejob cor-
rectly, we will insist it be done here in
the advising center, near sources and
records," Koloc said. “This will
maintain the integrity of the advis-
ing center.“ .

Koloc added the advising center
will not send a student‘s records to
any department until the student
declares a major in thatidepartment.

Koloc also noted that the advising
center had been staffed by faculty
members in the early l960‘s, but the
faculty advisors disliked their posi-
tions and were gradually replaced by
graduate students.

Departmental advisors have also

The Pitt News, Monday, March 30, 1981

been cut, according to Rosenberg.
He declined to indentify which.
department advisors have been cut,
but said the ratio of majors per
number of faculty members_was the
major criteria for deciding which
departmental advisors would be cut.
Those departments where the
number of majors exceeded seven
per faculty member did not receive
cuts," Rosenberg said. In depart-
ments where the ration was below
seven, “that's not too much to ask
for the faculty to advise," he said.
Mary Briscoe, English Depart-
ment chairman, said the English
department was notified its two,
advisors _have been cut.

' “It is my understanding all depart-
ment advisors are being cut,” Bris-
coe said. “Whether some are
negotiable or not, l don’t know."

The history department ad-visor
has also been eliminated, but history
department chairman Seymore
Drescher said that decision “ is not
yet absolutely determined.”

“We’re trying to present alterna-
tives and appeal to the good sense of
the administration," Drescher said.

isn’t a national problem that doesn‘t
have a world dimension.”

Also Jordan said that the feeling
ofsuperiority led to arrogance in our
foreign policy. He cited the spread of
nuclear arms and the threat it poses
as an example of the consequence of
this arrogance.

“We live in such a fast changing
and complex world that you can
conclude our country is going to
hell,” Jordan said. “I don’t believe

A that."

While the United States has lost in

  
 

   

absolute power because ofits depen- 

dency on other countries for some of
its needs, Jordan said it has not lost
in relative power. .
According to Jordan, our econ-
omy stays strong despite the massive
problems of social nature. The Uni-
ted States has created more newjobs
in the last ll years than Japan -or
West‘ Germany and it has reversed
the trend of increasing foreign oil
imports in the last few years.
Further, Jordan asked: “Who
would the people who criticize us
have us be? The Soviet Union?”
Jordan pointed out that _ the

“Our particular advisor plays a cen-
tral role in giving the department
coherence."

Drescher said his department is
“still negotiating" with Rosenberg
about the cut.

FAS bylaws state that 40 signa-
tures are required for a special meet-
ing. Wion said he is unsure of how
mary signatures have been col-
lected, but said “I am sure there are
40 faculty members concerned
enough to sign."
said he has not received the
petitions. ,

Wion, who is also head of Pitt
Professional Union, a group of

collective bargaining rights for Pitt
professors, said Pitt’s faculty should
have a voice in budget decisions.
“The best way for the faculty to

“The biggest problem the faculty
faces now is that information is still
very hard to come by,” Wion said.

“Collective bargaining would give
the faculty a way to work together,
instead of against each other,” Wion

‘said. "The faculty want to have a say

in how budget decisions are made.
The right and most effective way is
through collective bargaining.” ,
Wion also said there are alterna-

point when he said too much money
was being spent on administrative
inessentials and frivolities,” Wion
said. He added that if the university
were to sell the houses it provides
rent-free to Pitt Chancellor Wesley
Posvar and other administrators,
that additional money might be

enough to keep the advising center
going another year.

ln addition, Wion said that Pos-
var‘s remarks in a recent interview,
calling faculty unions “unnecessary”
and athreat to free discourse and
collegiality, are “nonsense.”

“Collective bargaining would
create a relationship in which faculty
can deal with the administration
more nearly as equals, which is
closer to collegiality,” Wion said.

A petition is circulating among
the faculty of arts and sciences to
request a special Faculty of Arts and
Sciences (FAS) meeting todiscuss
FAS budget cuts, according to Eng-
lish professor Philip Wion.

“The meeting will provide a

"chance for the faculty to discuss the
implications ofthe cuts, and perhaps
to take action as a faculty.” Wion
said;

Soviet Union has built a war
machine at the expense of its peo-
ple’s needs and that its economy has
become increasingly dependent
upon foreign imports. He added that
the unpopular war in Afghanistan

has—cost them support from some-

basis of their control is being tested
in Poland. -

Jordan said that he believes one of

By ANN WALKER

Pitt News Slcili Writer

Pitt’s Student Health Center is
planning to bring health informa-
tion to the students through a “Tra-
veling Medicine Show,” according
to Franklin Carter, Student Health
Center director. P

A brightly painted blue and gold
cart will carry health information
directly to the students.

“The Health Education Depart-
ment does not have the classroom
space needed to show students sche-
duled programs such as no smoking
clinics or blood pressure screenings,
and the cart will provide a means of
getting this sort ofthing out to the
students," according to Carter.

Carter said the mechanics of
-health programs, which include car-
rying the pamphlets to and from the
sites and setting up tables to display
the information, require a special
cart to carry the information and
display it all in one area.

The areas the cart will service
include the Towers Lobby and the
Student Union. The cart, which cost
$1,690, will be used to display blood
pressure screenings, cancer detec-

tion information, stress prevention
pamphlets, nutrition and exercise
programs, and cold clinics, accord-
ing to Carter.

The funding for the cart came
from the student health fee each stu-
dent must pay with his tuition.

Carter explained that the Health
Education Department has two
health educators which develop the
“outreach” programs. The nurse
health educators will perform the
blood pressure tests at the cart for
those interested in detecting high
blood pressure. Also, the cold clinic
will provide preventive measures
along with specific treatment
systems.

“The new cart will be featuring a
No Smoking Clinic during National
Cancer Week coming up this week,”
Carter said. “We’ve also planned an
audio-visual film to present a nutri-

,tion program.”

The Health Center is hoping to
utilize student volunteers and the
Peer Medical Aid Program (PMAP)
to help with the cart and the presen-
tations. A Stress Control presenta-
tion is being written and plans are
underway to produce a video tape
for this program, Carter said.

Bob LaCivita, health educator,

the students should receive through
utilization of the Pitt “Traveling

“We‘re hoping that the audio-

LaCivita said. “We‘re taking health

people to keep healthy. lt’s a matter
of prevention, rather than treat-
ment, that we want to stress with the
new program."

LaCivita said he has been a health‘

educator for the past three years and
is now working on a Doctoral in
Higher Education. He received a
Master's degree in Public ‘Health
from the University of Pittsburgh.
“The new cat makes the Health

Marzani doubted their convic-

This, he feels, indicated the com-
ing of Eurocommunism to the Uni-
ted States. '

The suspect was later freed of any

Jordan  

closed by Pierre Sallinger in
January.

“The Iranians sought me out
because I was responsible for con-

‘ vincing the Shah to move to Panama

and thought to be close to President
Carter,” Jordan said.

Jordan said that part ofthe nego-
tiations dealt with trying to under-
stand their grievances. He added
that the Iranians blamed all their
nation’s problems on the Shah and
that the Shah’s shortcomings were
blamed on the United States.

Jordan also said that the hostages
were let go ultimately because the

, Iranians saw it was in their own

interest to let them go, and not out of
fear of what action President Rea-
gan might take.

Another member of the audience,
who picked up on Jordan’s notion
that the public was unwilling to
accept Carter’s approaches and
solutions to problems, asked Jordan
if he agreed that it was the media
who failed or perverted the presenta-
tion of these problems and
solutions.

Jordan, who was depicted by the
media as a contro_versial figure dur-
ing Carter’s administration, said
that he never believed the media was
out to get him or the president, but
rather he sawit as a statement of

journalism today.

Jordan said he believes that as the
result of Vietnam and Watergate,
the media has moved from being
“skeptical and probing” to “cynical
and negative" about the news they
cover.

Furhter, Jordan said the «media
has at times failed to give issues the
perspective they deserve. He cited

the exaggeration of the Haig matter _

and the fact that it received prece-
dence over the story on Poland on
all three network newscasts on-Wed-
nesday evening, as an example.

Jordan said that former President
Carter is working on a book and
doubts very much that he will run
for anything again..He added that
Carter is “at peace with himself.”

“I believe President Carter will be
judged well by history,”.Iordan said.
“He came to office at a difficult
period and dealt with things that
hadn’t been dealt with or faced by

the presidents before him.”

Examples cited by Jordan
included: the Panama Canal Treaty,
the Camp David Summit, the SALT
II talks and his stand on human
rights,

tolerate it.”

In regards to Ted Kennedy's chan-
ces as the 1984 Democratic Presi-
dential Candidate, Jordan said that
there are democrats who may never
forgive Kennedy for challenging and
fragmenting the party in the last
election." ’

And what will Jordan be doing in
I984?

“My life is moving in a new direc-
tion," said Jordan, who has worked
for Carter ever since he first sought
the governorship ofGeorgia in I970.
“I’ve always had a strong interest in
writing." Jordan said he had just
returned from Hollywood, where he
is collaborating on three screen-
plays, one of which deals with the
hostage crisis. I

In mentioning that he had
“crammed four years of college into
five-and-a:-half years," Jordan said
he regrets that he did not take school

‘ more seriously.

“The challenge ofeducation today
is to make it more relevant to the
humanexperience,” Jordan said.

Jordan said in his closing remarks
that politics is “the best vehicle for
change” and urged the audience to
vote and to _take an active interest,
rather than a passive interest, in pol-
itical affairs.

Opening Eyes

It took an ianonymous phone call and a serious
accident to alert Pitt officials to the fact that physical
hazing was being performed by a Pitt fraternity.

Or did it? -

It seems unlikely Pitt’s fraternity adviser and the
lnterfraternity Council were caught completely
unaware when they learned of the hospitalization of
two Duquesne University students who were pledges
of Alpha Phi Alpha, lnc.

“ Pitt officials have been turning their heads from V ~
what is an obvious display to Pitt students: some Pitt
fraternities are openly engaging in hazing, and Pitt
applies a double standard in dealing with them.

Signs of fralternity hazing are evident throughout
the campus'—iln the Litchfield Towers lobby, at foot-
ball games, in l_.othrop Hall. , .

The university has a written policy condemning haz— - '
ing. The hazing policy states that “hazing is not per-
mitted and h_as no place” in the Greek system.
Activities which would cause physical or psychologi-
cal harm to an individual are prohibited bv the policv.

All Pitt fraternities are required to read and sign the
policy. But all Pitt fraternities are also required to turn
in a pledge roster tothe lFC. In the case of Alpha Phi
Alpha, ‘Inc, a pledge roster was never turned in and
the hazing policy was not followed. Furthermofé,

although Alpha Phi Alpha, Inc. has appealed the deci-

sion, the fraternity never denied the hazing charges.

If the university wants to consider its hazing policy
a more than just a piece of paper, it should take this
' opportunity-now. when the serious consequences of
‘hazing have been clearly illustrated—to step in and
enforce the rules it sets down; '
Why this has not been adequately done is unclear. '
The lFC or the university may fear charges of racism if
they crack down on Black fraternities, or charges of '
unfairness. or favoritism if they punish any others.
Pitt can no longer wait for an accident or injury to
compel it to discipline fraternities for hazing. That
time is already here. Already two students have been
hurt, and before the situation worsens Pitt should step

PhilosophyWar: Thought Politics

By REBECCA HOLSEN

Philosophers are ﬁghting among
themselves. To all appearances the
fight is just another power struggle
between the ‘haves’ and the ‘have
nots.’ But the twist in this case is that

‘what the “haves”. have is not just

wealth and status, but also, so they
say, merit. The difference between
them is supposed to be philosophi-
cal. But it became a difference worth
fighting for only when it was seen as
economic. ' F

The pluralists claim that a certain
style. the ‘analytic’. style, illegiti-
mately dominates professional phi-
losophy. They view the APA (the
American Philosophical Associa-
tion) as a tool in the hands of the
‘establishment-philosophe_rs’, used
to retain and perpetuate the ana-
lysts’s dominance in philosophy.
They formed a political rather than a
philosophical alliance of all non-
analystsiin order to protest the ideo-
control. The analysts

ignoring the charge of discrimina-
tion, emphasizing instead the dis-
grace of politicizing a philosophical
debate. .

The dominance of analysts in

  ANALYSIS

_ 
The fighting is first over money—-

 

grants, publishing privileges, and
prestigious jobs—and only inciden-
tally over the question, ‘What is phi-
lisophy?’ Whatis philosophy? Who
are the great philosophers? These
questions are probably beyond pol-
itical manipulation. But a fair distri-
bution of available resources is not;
and neither is a minimum recogni-
tion of the work of those who think
differently. .

Philosophers, however, seem out
of love with wisdom these days.
They are too busy fighting to sur-
vive. Often the fight is purely eco-
nomic. But in the higher analytic
echelons, as. for instance. at the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, the fight is for
something less tangible, something

*‘ like self—respect. It is difficult for a

philosopher to admit that radically
different, views are worthwhile,
because frequently in philosophy it
turns out that the correctness of

‘ one’s own views depends on an error

in someone else‘s. Thus philo-
sophers have some stake in not tak- .

power is present—arrogance as well

as condescension for the pluralists— .

the corresponding narrow-
mindedness is not immediately
apparent. Pittsiburgh’s philosophers
do not concern themselves with the
economic question, but they are
eager to disprove the charge of phi-
losophic parochialism. And they
must be -seen as partially successful,
since even the head of the pluralists
conceded Pittsburgh’s philosophical
breadth, calling the Pitt department

an exception among analytici

—q~

institutions.
But if Pittsburgh, a paradigmatic

analytic school, doesn’t,fit the ana-.

lyst mold, what department does?
What is the philosophical difference
which the pluralists believe underlies
the economic discrimination?
Some philosophers, all of them‘
analysts, say that analysts are just
better philosophers—that is the dif-
ference! Others agree with this, and
think the pluralists’s activity stems
from resentment of their ‘betters’;
butthen argue that oneofthe ration.-
alizatjons of this resentment
happens to be a legitimate ground

for complaint. Philosophy has lost

its raison d’etre. lt is unclear what

.the point of doing it is any more,"

And this seems a direct consequence

/What is philosophy? Who are the great.ph_ilosopihers? These questions are probably
beyond politiral manipulation‘. But a fair distribution ofavailahle resources is not; and

historical accident. Around the time

' of the Second World War, leading

analytical philosophers came to the
United States; the phenomenolo-
gists and existentialists, for the most
part, stayed in Europe. Among the
original analysts there were many
innovative and‘ powerful philo-
sophers. And with the-help of the
English analysts, who were frequent
visitors at the more prestigious
American departments. theyvtaught

the generation that rules today.

In the last ten ycars.,how‘ever. the
plurali.x'l.x' desire for recognition has
grown. There isa new wave of philo-
sophers demanding their place in
professional philosophy. In the 50’s
and 60‘s their predecessors could

afford to stayin the background. I

The pluralists fight for material

argument, and an enthusiasm for

if philosophical contributions that are

permanent (permanent?) because
they are not merely the expression of
personal opinion but the presenta-
tion of arguments in a form that
demands the assent of those who
understand arguments." Whether or
not this overstates the analysts‘s
case, clearly it is unfair to the
pluralists--implying. as it does. that
they are not concerned with sound
arguments. or even with arguments.

justified. Before I discuss the charge
of economic discrimination, one
point should be clarified. The APA
is the professional institution for
philosophers. The following ques-
tion has arisen: is the APA involved
in influencing policy in grant distri-
butions, publishing, accreditation of

.__mnrinued,/tom page eight

the present distribution of grant
money would be fair. But while
some will claim that the best philo-
sophers are analytic. none seems wil-
ling to say that. excluding the top
(ten, twenty.‘ at most thirty) philo-
sophers. in the philosophical com-
munity at large analysts are better
philosophers than pluralists. .
Suppose that all the ‘best’ philo-
sophrs were supplied with grants.
The question would remain how the
rest of the grant money ought to be
distributed. There is a_ second level

'How then are _we to zmrlerstaml the analyst's insisterzre that all isfair? The answer is

simple: The most influential philosophers

philosophy.’

are analysts. They set the staaifarils of 'good'

methodical difference without pre-
supposing the methodology of one
or the other side‘? I'm not sure. One
thing said of their own approach by
analysts is that at least it's easier to
see when you’ve made a mistake. But
this seems to be true only for some
parts of analytic philosophy, those
that overlap with special sciences
such 3 mathematics or physics. Con-
trary to rumor, the majority ofana-
lytic philosophy isnot written in
symbolic notation. in most
philosophy—analytic as well as
phenomenological—we must rely
on? understanding and judgement,
for which the ability to test argu-
ments for validity is at best a neces-
sary condition.

Many other ways of distinguish-
ing the two_ groups have been sug-
gested, but none will serve. For
example some say that the scientific
method has influenced the analytic
approach and that the pluralists are
more drawn to the literary method.
This may be tl'U‘€ as far as it goes, but
it leaves the question open as to
which are better philosophers. Bet-
ter by which standard?

After all such distinctions have
failed, how do these intellectual dif-
ferences, however we might charac-
terize them, underwrite the
economic issue? In two ways: ‘The
issue’ is misleading. From the ana-

lysts‘s point of view, the issue is the '

pluralists’s unjustified politicization
of philosophy, and a betrayal ofthe
philosophical ideal. From the plura-
lists’s point of view, the issue is not

departments, and so on‘? The repre-
sentative analyst says no; the plural-
is.t ‘says yes. Although neither is
lying, the analysts’s answer is mis-
leading. It is true that the APA does
not officially supervise any of these
activities (except in the case oftravel
grants); but it is indirectly involved.
Members of the APA are called
upon by granting agencies,.endow-
ment sponsors, and hiring'commit-
tees for advise. Since the APA is the
main representative body for philo-
sophers, it is the obvious place fora
non-philosopher to go to get infor-
mation about the qualifications of
other philosophers. . '

So granting the power of indirect
involvement, what finally is the dis-
pute? The pluralists held that
roughly 2/3 of research grants went
to analysts in 1978, which seems out
of proportion to the number ofcom-
peting a_naylsts and pluralists. There
are other complaints of substance: a
graduate department with no ana-
lysts on its staff had trouble getting
accreditation; the prestigious jour-
nals are said to be biased against
pluralist philosophy; tenure review
committees treat pluralists less sym-

pathetically than analysts. But l_

want to focus on the issue of grants
here, since, if true, it supports the
general claim of economic
discrimination. *

best, which is where most philo-
sophers dwell, analysts, or
pluralists. The charge of discrimina-
tion applies at this level. The plural-
ists claim both that they are not a
numerical minority and that they
only get approximately 1/3 of the
grants. The onlyjustification for this
would be evidence that pluralists are
generally worse philosophers. But
no such evidence exists. So the plu-
ralists seem right in their claim of
economic discrimination.

How then are we to understand

the analystssinsistence that all is
fair? The answer is simple: The most
influential philosophers are ana-
lysts. They set t_he standards of
‘good‘ philosophy. They develop a
certain jargon’, a method or style,
which becomes" the most, -if not the
only, acceptable philosophical form.
it is then a matter ofcource for other
philosophers to conform to it. For
once established, the philosophical
approach gains influence by reward-
ing those who perpetuate it—calling
their work clear, precise. rigorous—
and discouraging those who don’t_—
claiming they lack standards.

Can this_ be avoided? Philo-
sophers,_like other people, have their
prejudices; unlike others, their work
IS to examine prejudice.
increased awareness seems
demand increased responsibility.
Granted, it is difficult to think out-
side of one’s paradigm; but the con-
sequences of failure are, for
philosophers, unacceptable.

Penn St.TlIwartsPitt Upset,Takes EAIA

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

Pitt News Sports Editor

After two events in Friday night’s
session of the Eastern Regional
Gymnastics Championships, the
Pitt Pantherette team clung to a slim

lead over the pre-meet favorite Penn .

State Lady Lions.

Pitt’s Lisa Shirk, _ranked ninth
nationally in the all-around, over-
came an array of injuries and illness
at the start ofthe meet and rocketed
to a 9.45 score on the vault and a 9.5
on the uneven bars. Combined with
strong performances from team-
mates Lori Miller, Karen Martin,
Myra Bachuchin, Bonnie Tressler,
and Holly Martino, the underdog
Pitt team was actually winning the
meet by eight-tenths of a point.

It wasn’t supposed to be that way.
Penn State entered the meet as'the
East’s No., l seeded team and
ranked second in the country. The
Lady Lions were averaging over 147
points a meet, a full four points bet-
ter than Pitt’s season average. But
stranger things have happened,
right?

Well, not Friday night. Penn
State’sVversion ofthe dynamic duo-
freshman Heidi Anderson and
senior Lisa lngebretsen went to
work on the third event, the beam,
and when the rosin had settled, the
Lady Lions had roared to the team
championship, 145.75 to Pitt's
142.45, to slightly overshadow a fine
effort by the Pantherette team.

For the rest of the teams in the

A hunt, it wasn’t even close. New
' Hampshire featured a couple offine
-individual performers—Edie Sutton

and Lucie Cancelmo~—but didn’t
have the depth to challenge ‘Pitt or
Penn State and "wound up third.
West Virginia, the tournament's No.
3 seed, was conspicuously quiet

throughout the meet and dropped a ‘

notch to finish in fourth-place in the
standings in the eight-team field.
The turning point for both Pitt
and Penn State came on the same
event‘-—the balance beam. After the
vault and several breaks in their rou-
tines on the uneven bars, the Lady
Lions rebounded to grab four ofthe
. top five places in the beam.
Anderson, currently tied for No. l
in the national rankings in the all-
around, scored a meet high 9.75 on

unnerved as the Penn State coaches-
tried to console her.

“We been in gymnastics with
Anderson since she was ten years
old, and its not her nerves," said
Pitt‘s Martino. “She’s a perfectionist
and she’s hard on herself. She seems
upset in the warm-ups, but once the
competition starts, that’s it.”

lngebretsen and teammate Pat
Spisak tied for second at 9.2 and
Penn State’ Marcy Levine grabbed
fourth with a 9.1.

“We had three good events and
one that wasjust putrid," said Penn
State coach Judy Avener, “We were
just cruising for a bruising. We

haven’t really had a bad meet this V

year."

Penn State’s team effort on the
beam yielded a 37.25 score and
pushed them ahead for good, as they
went on to win the championship as
Pitt had some trouble on the same
event.

Unlike Penn State, Pitt was com-
ing off ofa strong team performance
on the bars. After Shirk in the lead,
Pitt’s Martin held down third-place
with an 8.95, and Pantherettes
Tressler and Bachuchin tied for
eighth place at 8.75.

“I never found out until after the‘
meet that we were leading Penn
State halfway through. Going into
the beam, I wastjust trying to keep
_the team from getting too excited
since we had done so well on the
bars," said Pitt coach Donna Sanft,
who was named the East's Coach of
the Year at Saturday night’s award
ceremony. “We purposely avoided
keeping track of the scoring because

, we were trying to concentrate on get-

ting a high team score that would
qualify us for Nationals.”

Pitt’s first three girls on the beam
Evans, Tressler,‘ and Martin had dif-
ficulties during their routines and all
three fell offthe beam. Pitt's Regina
Carson turned in a strong 9.1 score
to place fourth and Martino over-
came a small break to log a 8.75.
Pitt’s last competitor was Shirk and
the effects of her illness began to
show as she fell offthe beam too, but
regrouped to earn a 8.6.

“The beam was the big difference
for Penn State. Any time you have
three or four girls scoring nine or
above on the same event, w’el-

Klein. “We were close tothem. Lisa ,

NBA MajorStep for Panther Star Sam Clancy

By MIKE DICHIARA

Pill News Staff Writer

Another era has come to an end at
Pitt this year. The first one was when
Hugh Green finished his collegiate
career, one that has been as sensa-
tional as _when Tony Dorsett danced
through opponents’ defenses for the
Panthers. The second to come to a
close is the Sam Clancy era, a career
in which no other Pitt basketball
player has been as dominating a
force.

As with Green, Clancy now has
his sights set upon a professional
career._ Unlike Green, Clancy’s suc-
cess is not recognized as guaranteed.
The question that has been kicked
around by the media during the last
month is not whether Clancy will be
drafted but, rather, will he be able to
sustain a successful career in the
National Basketball Association.

The annual NBA college draft is
in June and there have been different

‘predictions about how high or low

Clancy will be picked. Gne of the
broadcasters who did the NCAA
tournament game against ldaho said
Clancy could go as high as late inthe
first round.

On the other hand, a column in
the Pittsburgh Press said Clancy
probably wouldn’t be picked until
the fifth or sixth round.

“I don’t know,"Clancy said about
the upcoming draft. “The NBA is a
strange organization. People have
gone in the second, third or fourth
rounds who were_n_’t supposed to go
then. It's hard to say.”

Getting drafted should not be the
problem. Clancy's size, listed in the
Panther media guide as '6-foot-7, 235
pounds, is enough to make any pro
team seriously consider him. The
key will be what role he will be
expected to play. '

“l expect to be a strong forward. It
will probably be the same type ‘of

role like here at Pitt.” Clancy said.
“I’ll be expected to score 10 or l2
points, grab some rebounds and, of
course, play some ‘D’ (defense).”

The NBA is vastly different from
the college level. According to
Clancy, the NBA has better players,
it is more physical and there is more
running involved.

“The difference is unbelievable,”
he said.

“My~physical talent is a plus,’
Clancy said about his_chances of an
NBA team. “I wouldn’t depend on
thejumper. l’d depend on the things
that got me where l am. _

“I can move quickly fora big man.
My mental attitude is much better
than in my freshman year. l like to
work hard and listen,” Clancy said.

Those qualities are definitely
going to help Clancy impress an
NBA head coach. Clancy is the
leader-type who is not afraid to take
charge. He took charge of the Pitt
squad this season and led them to
the NCAA tournament._

Pitt coach Roy Chipman said ear-
lier in the year about Clancy’s lead-
ership ability: “I'm not very big, but
Sam is and the players have to
answer to him.”

On the other hand, there are some
things that Clancy will have to work
extra hard on to overcome in mak-
ing a pro team.

“My ball handling‘is not where it
should be,” he said. “l’m also not
always_ aggressive.’ There's about 10

A percent of the time when l get a little

slow. 1 have to cut "down on turnov-
ers, too.”

“Getting into the (NCAA) tourna-
ment gave me a chance to prove my
ability," Clancy said. “it improved»
my chances of getting into the NBA.
Getting there means being one of the
bettergcollege players, but l’d have to
learn more.”

Following Clancy’s junior year,
he considered switching to play foot-

basketball program was very
unsettled. -, *’

if for some reason, Clancy would
not get drafted or just couldn’t play
in the NBA, there is a slim possibility
of him playing -football, for Pitt.

“l’d like to try it, I thinkil would,”

said Clancy after a long pause.,“:Bu't

l have a son and l’ll be marrying my
girlfriend, so I want to take care of
my family. They’d be going through
this, too. So l’d also look into some
other way of taking care of them.”

“The decision would have to be

Pat Greenwell Cops

By SEAN BARNES

Pm NewsSponsVVmer

Panther diver Pat Greenwell
proved his exceptional diving talent

last weekend by placing l2th in the ’

nation on the one—meter diving
board at the men’s NCAA Swim-
ming and Diving Championships at
Austin, Texas. For senior co-
captain Greenwell, his All-America
status is a fitting finale to an out-
standing collegiate diving career at
Pittsburgh. .

Also diving well on the one-mete
board was Pitt’s Mike Minik. His
_l 6th place finish was close to achiev-
ing All-America status.

“With two more years of college
and a coach like Julian (Krug), I’m
sure l’ll do better next year, and
hopefully even make Nationals on

both boards like Pat Greenwell did,”

When the four days of swimming
and diving concluded Saturday
night, l3 of 18 NCAA records had

“The quality and speed of this
year’s meet surpassed any other on
record,” said Pittcoach Fred Lewis.
“You know it was fast when to make
All-America in the 50-yard freestyle,
you had to break the current
national record.”

Swimming the 50-freestyle as well
as the 100-freestyle was Panther
Rick Carter. Although he is a two-
time Eastern champ in both events,
this year's times at Nationals were
just too fast for him to place.

Sandy Pidgeon also just missed‘
placing in his event, the 200-yard
breaststroke. His time of 2:04 was
good, but with the first-place time of

Panther Gymnast Trio Earns
Invitation to Nationals

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

Pin News Sports Editor

For the first time in Pitt men‘s
gymnastics history, three members
of the Ffanther team have qualified
to compete in the NCAA National
Gymnastics Championships‘. This
year‘s competition begins Thursday
at the University of Nebraska.

Junior Bob Besong and freshman '

Dave Smith have been named to the
Eastern team in the floor exercise
and . freshman Frank Kratz has
received a bid to compete in the
vault. Under a system adopted two
years ago, gymnasts are voted to the-
Eastern team, based on their season
scoring averages.- by a committee
comprised of Eastern member-

  

school coaches. The East did away
with the men's regional champion-
ship system such as the women use
to determine their qualifiers to
Nationals. '

Before receiving news ofthe invi-
tations Saturday. the Pittegymnasts
were forced into a waiting game
after their last competition two
weeks ago. V

“l was really hoping for the bid.“
Besong said, “the average was there.

it wasjust a matter of them coming

through with the invitation.”

In addition to the ﬂoor exercises,
Besong narrowly misses qualifying
in two other events. Aftera standout
season this year in the All—Around,
Besong missed the National cut in

that event by two places, andjust '

 just felt this‘-W009

“l was doing research on my master’s program
in Mexico at the time. As part of it, l became in— I

strong, emotional feeling about the whole thing.

“That’s what got me interested in nursing. With
my previous college experience, all l needed was
four classes to begin'.’ -

But picking the right program was a difficult
task. ' "

“l was really confused. l.couldn’t believe the
number of nursing programs available. I really
didn't know what they all meant. '

7“So l started making phone calls. 1 had some
definite goals and received many positive com— F
merits from several schools. But that first call to
St. Margaret's was something special. I explained
my goals and they were really stfaight with me.
They (the faculty) seemed to understand’.'

A How does the curriculum at St. Margaret's

missedqualifying for the high bar by
one place. The top six average scor-
ers in each event receive national
bids. .

There wasn’t a great deal of dis-
tance separating all three Pitt gym-
nasts from the No. l slot in their
respective events. Besong qualified
with a 9.25 and Smith with a 9.l8

average. while the first place average .

was a 9.4. Just eight—hundredths ofa
point seperated Kratz, in sixth place
with a 9.5} average, from‘the top
place in the vault—-a 9.6l average.
Both Besong and_Pitt head coach
Frank D'Amico are confident that
all three of the gymnasts can exceed
their average scoresat Nationals.
“All three have good chances to
make it into the finals,“ D‘Amico
said. “We‘re planning on adding
some moves with greater risks into
each of the guy’s routines. They’ve
"all been practicing the moves for
some time, but we haven’t used them
in competition yet.” ‘
“If we all hit. we’re all capable of
scoring better at Nationals," Besong
said. “I'm pretty confident in the
move l’ll be adding. We practiced it
today (Saturday) after we found out
we’d be going to Nationals, and it

_ went pretty well.”

This is the first time in D‘Amico‘s
fo_ur-year tenure as coach that any of
his gymnasts have qualified for
Nationals. But, the way things seem
to be developing on the Pitt team, it
may become a trend in the next few
years. All three gymnasts return
next year, and Smith and Kratz still
have a full three years of eligibility
after this year. D’Amico isn’t the‘
type of coach who ‘rests on his
laurels—this past weekend he tra-

The Pitt Pantherettes basketball team ended their season in impressive fashion as they finished fifth‘in
the women's NIT tournament this weekend at Amarillo, Texas. The fifth place finish was accomplished by
virtue of a run and gun 93-91 win over Tennessee Tech. The Pantherettes offset a tournament record 47
point performance by Tech's Jennifer Harper with some balanced scoring to win the game. ‘

Five Pantherettes cracked double figures, with Penny Welsh leading the way with 18 points, Lori Dolby
added 16, Debbie Lewis chipped in 13 while Gail Aughburns and Pam_Miklasevich poured in 12 and 10
respectively.

Eastern 8 Champs Lure R€CI‘.ul°l‘T

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

Assistant Sports Editor

   

  THE
PITTSBURGH 

UNDERGRADUATE
I REVIEW

The fruits of being in the NCAA
tournament as the Eastern 8 repre-
sentative have begun to show for the
Pitt Panthers. Obviously impressed
by their post-season tournament
appearance, Andre Williams, a 6-

’ foot-7 forward, said yes to Roy
Chipman by signing an Eastern 8
letter of intent.

Wil1iams, who four weeks ago
reneged' at Pitt’s advances, called

. Chipman after the Panthers took the
-. Eastern 8 title from Duquesne, to
" "say he had changed his mind.

Playing for Murry Bergstraum
High School in Brooklyn, Williams
averaged 2| points and I2 rebounds

— a game. An All—New York City for-

’ ward, Williams was the darling of
NIT runner-up Syracuse before
deciding on Pitt. So interested were

I the Orangemen that members of.lim
Boehiem's staff spent much timein
Williams home even as late ' as
Thursday night. _'

Reportedly an excellent passer,
Williams becomes the fourth Pitt
recruit inked this year. Williams
joins Roosevelt Kirby, a 6-foot-9
forward, Chip Watkins, a 6-foot-6
forward, and Charley Thompson, a
6-foot-5 shooting guard.

.. Coach Roy Chipman ha”s_Willi-
ams slotted for a shooting forward
position and said Williams may even
become a second guard if he doesn’t
grow. There is reason to believe,
however, that he will grow some
more. Williams’two brothers gradu-
ated from high school at 6-foot-6,
but ended up growing to 6-foot-I0.

Already tabled as. a successful
recruiting year, the Pitt staff is still
looking to land Jeff Hoffler, 6-foot-
9 centerfrom New Haven, Connecti-
—cut, and George Allen, a 6-foot
guard from New York City.

MUMMENSCHANZ

Swiss Mime Theater
Broadway Theater Series
Heinz Hall-

Mummenschanz is metaphoric creativity. lt is a synthesis of mime,
slapstick, masks, dance‘, art, gymnastics, sideshow antics, symbolic theater,
and abstract expression into an unequaled visual innovation.

They poke and twist at each other’s sculptured expressions. Their faces
change. . .

Two characters enter the light in another sequence. Their eyes and
mouths are projected into representative pads of paper in the correspond-
ing places. On each sheet is a colorful eye or mouth, reflecting the respec-
tive facial features. Their_ expressions shift as they peel pieces of paper
off the pads, manipulating the feelings and their consequent emotions. '

They attack each other. Tearing sheet after sheet off the other’s pads,
they control each other’s feelings, both sliding from vengefulness to

. reproach to unhappiness. The message is clear.
This is what Mummenschanz offers; the art reaches theatricalstrata

Real theme in addition to the sparkle.
Mummenschanz is geometric mime. Body parts are replaced by cubes,
trapezoids, and other less describable prisms. The interplaybof the

body.

' But the magic element in Mummenschanz is the athletics. The three
members of the company, John Murphy, Claudia Weiss, and Peter Schelling
perform impossible feats of strength, flexibility, and ingenuity to create an
enrapturing stage show with a flair all its own. .

Comedy is also a major element of the Mummenschanz concept. Defying
a.viewer's perception of the human body's natural constraints, the per-
formers contort their bodies to impossible extremes. These extremes are
the Mummenschanz standard. Believable physical proportion is eradicated;
and the new medium gives rise to some h_ilarious situations.

Picture two performers in black, their faces molded from masks of clay. -

myriads beyond what appears on stage. Behind all the dazzling and innova-e
tive stage tricks, the performers are actually saying something of relevance. ..

abstracted parts illustrates the beauty and the awkwardness of the human.

  

l The personifieii "pest" from
Mummenschanz

The performers use a variety of stage props, objects external to their ~
bodies, to achieve the same effect. One sequence has a long tube volleyinga
large balloon with the audience. When a return volley is catapulted beyond '
the "tube's" reach, it turns and faces the audience with a genuinely worried
look. The tube that is. It recoils, donning a very human‘ expression. The Vi
result is uproarious. A . , ' _ ’

This is a major asset of the company; objects, and there are many, when '
well conceived and-Emanipulated can represent and even amplify human _‘
emotion. ' . ’

This is original entertainment. Though often forced to stoop fora '-
cheaper than necessary laugh due to its less sophisticated audience, the

show makes some extremely valid statements about human relationships.__ 

And that, in essence, is theater.

WINGS

Written by Arthur Kopit
Directed by Iames Gardner
Soho Repertory Theater

Wings is an empathetic journey into
the stumbling mind_of a woman who
has just suffered a stroke. And an
extraordinary woman at that. The
audience is submerged"in full-force, V
into the horrors, the confusion, and
the frustration of Emily Stilson; a
former aerona-utical_ daredevil; a
woman who has "walked on wings." "

The people at the Soho have taken
their limited space, and their even
more limited budget, and twisted
both’ to their advantage. As a result,
we have spatial intimacy and creative
ingenuity both arising from these
perimeters. ' ' .

Directed by David Marchick
Allegheny repertory Theatre

The ”angry young man" is alive but
not well in John Osborne's Look Bark In

The play captures the rebellious,
discontented younger generation of

post-war Britain, during which the"

”welfare state” had given its econom-
ically underpriviledged children a
good free education. Being poor and
well-educated prompted a painful
awareness and resentment of class
barriers and social injustices. And out
of Look Back ln Anger grows the classic
image o_f the passionate and furious
”angry young man.”

The play centers on relationships
between the biting, wrathful Jimmy
Porter, played by Christopher Raw-
son, his timid wife Alison,
played by Marti‘ Donovan
and limmy’s good-

  

   

natured, tolerant friend Cliff Lewis,
played by Ray Leghart. The Porters
live in a shabby one-room flat _in

which Alison and Cliff heroically '

maintain a quiet, accepting attitude
against the grain of]immy's constant
boiling anger, acidic humor and
discontentment. ’

Rawsons’s performance leaves one
gasping. He heaps jagged criticisms
on Cliff, on Alison, and on society
with such vicious zeal and pop-eyed
energy that one suspects he is more
than an angry young man.

He is a man whose paranoia and

convulsive hatred of himself and oth~ .-

ers poison his surroundings and

mg‘;

. - . . . . . . . . . . . , . . .

those who touch him. As enjoyable as

Rawson_'s performance is, he com-
mands absolutely no vulnerability or
sympathy. During one scene in which

all sit at tea with Alison's delicately,

sarcastic friend Helena (played by
Maria Barney), Jimmy reveals that as
a child he had watched his_ father die.

Everyone suddenlybecornes rever—
ently sorry for him as if this trauma

‘ .

t0y_'o

had made his sick hatefulness under-
standable. However ]immy"s
attempts at vulnerability are over-
shadowed by his monster-self and
one is left hating him and wishing
him a deserving end. B

A

Jimmy's lack of humanity and
pathos also makes Alison's sympathy
for him a puzzlement. Of all the char-
acters she is psychologically abused
the most and bears it nobl-y and tim-
idly. When she chooses to go to
church with Helena instead of stay-

ing at Jimmy's side, she makes a sad
but determined demonstration that
she can withstand ]'immy’s bullyingi.

One hopes during the course of the
play that she won't end up as the mas-
ochistic woman who ”loves the dirty
rat anyway" but she predictably does.

One may not leave the play looking _ '

back in anger but in depression at the
injustices of a twisted relationship
that seems bound to stew in its own
poison forever. '

Albin (Michel Serrault), who is fon
of singing arias and getting hysteri

Bunch, with a slight twist.

The problem is the familiarity 0
the characters, which directo
Edouard Molinaro seems to think is
plus, but instead leads to boredom
There is no challenge in the film
because we are already very fond 0
Renato and Albin, so we don't have t
grow to accept them as we did in th
original.

The mood is matter—of—fact and th
plot (spies are trying to find micro

obtained) is dull. The film meander

The potential of the film—an anal-

When Albin and Renato have to flee
France because the spies are after

word, the film makes very funny and
articulate comments on men's and
women's roles in society. Albin,
mpeccably dressed in peasant prints,
oon realizes there's more to being a
woman than pretty clothes, and his
realization of this is quite touching.

When Francesca Corkle
. dances Giselle, she does it
as though spoken language were
cumbersome and secondary to the
expressiveness of dance. Corkle per-
forms the role of Giselle in a way that
makes the audience feel they have met,

come to know, and lost an intimate

friend. A .

Keith Martin dances the part of Count
Albrecht with a sensitive strength _and
charm befitting the role. The over-
whelming impression left when Martin
and Corkle dance together is one of
security. They dance with a precision
and control that allows one to forget
technique and focus on the story. There
is a‘ natural quality to their performance
that can only grow out of an expert
command of technique.

The most striking facet of Giselle is the
shift of focus away from dance, itself, to
a combination .of drama, dance, and use
of small gesture that adds an almost
modern element to this classic. The
performances are consistently skillful,
always arresting.

Giselle is the story of a young German
peasant girl who falls in love with a man
who comes to her village to hunt. The
man, who is also in love with Giselle,
turns out to be Count Albrecht, a
nobleman who is already betrothed to a
noblewoman. When Giselle learns this,
she goes mad and dances herself to
death. ‘

The second act begins with Count
Albrecht visiting the grave of Giselle.

Giselle has become one of the Wilis,

spirits of young women who have died

before they were wed, who now entrap

men and force them to dance either until

dawn or until they die. Albrecht is *

trapped by the Wilis and forced to dance,

though Giselle begs for his life. Giselle

dances with her lover, preserving him
until dawn when she must return to her

grave.

Throughout the ballet there is an
intimacy that develops between the
audience and dance, owing partly to the
visual effect of the stage. The sets are‘

simple and quickly become comfortable;
the costumes are interesting and

 
 

.appropriate,

_ but not distracting.

This background of simplicity
reinforces and frames the story.
In One sequence, two peasants dance
for the nobles. The peasants get into a
”dancing duel.” The man impresses the
» audience with his strength, leaping and
spinning. The woman returns the chal-
' lenge with steps that are delicate, intri-
cate, andprecise in movement. The
-. contrast is like a small demonstration of
the flexible range of‘ this art form, a
balance of precision and strength; an art
particular to neither sex, but unique to
both. » '
If there were any weak points in the
performance, they were due to factors
which could not possibly be controlled.
_ Martin's stage presence is not a com-
manding one. Though his features are
visible, hisstature is not striking. ‘But
what he lacks in height, he makes up for
in style and strength.

Another fine point of the ballet, or
related to it, was the excellent accom—.
paniment by the orchestra. Under the

direction of Ottavio De Rosa, the
orchestra didso exceptionally well that
at times, the orchestration became
noticeable. , . '
The combination of the orchestration
along with the fine performances, made
thisballet one even the most inexpe-'
rienced of balletomanes could enjoy.’

taking the stage at the Razz-

quiets down, Lovesick rips into
Chuck Berry's "Little Queenie."
After proud renditions of classic
sixties’ songs and some origi-
nals, the crowd is worked up.
The small room is filled with
overwhelming applause.

After the rousing first set, I
asked Mark Caloyer, guitarist &

"But," he continues, "we're

By.hearing several Lovesick

band has a distinct sound of

their own, combined with
innovative- new wave overtones
and with a slight touch of the
”roots—of-rock” ‘sound.

Explaining the inception of

a year ago, Daveyand I got
together with a basic idea of

we started looking for a lead

One month agol saw Donnie Iris in

' week ago, Iris and his Cruisers con-
firmed my impression once more-
that skinny guyxwith the glasses is
one polished performer.

After an impressive set by Norm
Nardini and The Tigers and a predic-
_table ‘set by the C-Brothers, it was
_Donnie's turn. Apparently, the
crowd was glad to have their‘Beaver

Iris’ singing is the highlight of the

Lovesick: Not Conforming To The Non-Conformists

the band, adds, ”In most Pitts-
burgh clubs, instead of playing
for young female audiences,
we're playing for old men. If the
state lowered the drinking age
or more under 21 clubs opened
up, playing out in this town
would be more rewarding for
bands." All four band members
agree.

With that in mind, Lovesick
had shied away from the bar
scene for awhile and entered
Ieree Studios in New Brighton
to record their first single,
"What's the Matter, Babe?"

Caloyer, who wrote the song,
comments, ”We had some of the
records pressed in red vinyl and
some in black. We took them to

and before we knew it, they
were calling us up for more."

l MONDO BONGO
The Boomtown Rats
Columbia

The Boomtown Rats seem to

miss their target. The album's

. title suggests a lot of danceable
music that's heavy on percus-
sion, yet only a few songs could
get you to move your feet. Still,
the music alone isn't bad. Bob
Geldof writes some god pop
songs, such as "The Elephant's
Graveyard" and ”Don’t Talk to
Me," but the Elvis Costello and
Buddy Holly influences are too
strong to give points for origi-
nality. In fact, the album's best
cut, an uptempo version of
Jagger—Richards’ ”Under My

' Thumb," is a remake. ”Another
Piece of Red" reminds me too
much of "I Don't Like Mondays"
and to call either a rock and roll
song is blasphemy.

While the music is sometimes
noteworthy, the lyrics are ridic-
ulous. ”Mood Manbo" is four
minutes of nonsense. A few
stabs at being political are made,
but they come off as too vague.
Most of the songs are pointless,
or redundant, or both. Anyone
who writes songs about staying
up all night or sleep-in their
room is scraping the bottom of
the barrel in my opinion. Gel-
dof's whiny voice doesn't help
matters, either.

The bio provided by the
record company says that the
Boomtown Rats are-the group
"that may yet speak for a gener-
ation." If they do, I hope it isn't
mine.

You gotta admire Black Flag's atti-

they're due to go onstage, haul their
equipment throughihe door, tune up
and play. When they're done they sit
down and talk to people. Direct from
Rona Barrett to you.

Black Flag played two sets of 16
songs with a rare intensity. They
were loud and aggressive, with all the

songs running together. At times the .

power. displayed was awesome, at

other times a. little‘ comical. The jolt ,

was present but the angerjmissed its

Last year when the League of

Fripp introduced the concert
with the suggestion that’ the
audience "listen" and dance
simultaneously." This sugges-
tion is still in effect. You can
shake your ass off dancing to
these songs and still perceive
the musical interplay. Barry
Andrew's percussive keyboards 
accents Fripp's angular, melodic
lines precisely. The rhythm sec-
tion has soul.
