mean‘? Ah, if we only knew; then
one of life’s greatest
would be solved. Perhaps Tuck re-
fers to the practice of tucking a
sandwich into one’s breadbasket.
However, the dictionary meaning
of tuck has little connection with
the daily menu of the Tuck Shop.
Said menu is a choice of five
sandwiches, four kinds of pie,
three desserts. two milkshakes,
and a coke (when you are lucky).
Students and an occasional fac-
ulty member slide trays past
stacks of sandwiches and things.
Clutching, grasping hands flash
into these stacks and pull out
food. A yawning register soon
looms before the hungry, and the

One hundred ﬁfty donors per day
is all that the mobile unit can han-
dle, but this is considerably more
than could’be taken care of last Oc-
tober when the unit was here at Pitt.
Equipment has been added to the
traveling outﬁt, and the personnel
has been increased. The unit now
carries ten beds, which makes it
possible to handle more donors at
one time. The congestion which was
so much in evidence throughout
Pitt’s four days of contribution in
October will not, then, be prevalent
when the unit returns for the sec-
ond time. '

Students under twenty-one
years of age are not permitted to
give blood without the written
consent of their parents. Cards
for enrollment in the drive for
donors will be placed in the infor-
mation room of the Cathedral
next week. Fathers must sign
these enrollment cards for all stu-
dents not of age. -

Class Gives Gift
To University

Enough money to purchase a
flag has been raised by the Me-
morial Committee of the Class of
’43. Leonard Wolk, C43, and Harriet
Harris,.C43, are co-chairmen of the

committee. Wolk graduated in
February. _ .
For seven years the purchase of

this flag has been the aim of
senior classes, but because of the
large expense of a new flag pole
the projectfwas not successful.
The class of ’43 has been success-

_ful because an unnamed .donor
has contributed a used pole to the
class. It will be used as a tem-
porary pole for the ﬂag purchased

' by the committee. The Memorial

U committee will also meet the ex-
pense of transporting and erect-
ing the ﬂag-pole.

“This flag is especially desirable
at the present time because the Uni-
versity is now a military post,”
said T. W. Biddle, dean of men. The
gift from the class amounts to
about four or ﬁve hundred dollars.

I I
  Umverstty Changes . -
. Within a,semester the University has changed. The stu-

dent body, the faculty, and the buildings themselves have all
undergone revision. This semester, for the ﬁrst time, the Uni-
I versity has become a complete wartime institution.

But if Pitt has changed outwardly, it has changed in-
Wardly as well. A serious minded student body has replaced
~ the Joe College of former years. For the wartime university
‘ A has no place for the Tuck Shop cowboy or the classroom dilet-
 . tante. Wartime curriculums are adjusted to meet the needs of

I .7 the technically trained specialists, the important war worker.
. , But perhaps the greatest change that has come to Pitt
_ has been the addition of the Air Crew Cadets. The University
‘a is no longer simply a school, it is a military post as well. Now
4 classes are interrupted with the sound of marching feet and
 the corridors are ﬁlled with kahki. Boys from all walks of life,
 pritllaiiaifferent backgrounds and different interests have come
0 . «
Never has the University had such a diversiﬁed student
.1  body, never has the University had as serious a student body
 as this one. This new group of students has given a different
"  attitude to the University—an attitude which it never before
possessed. An attitude of wartime expedience, wartime emer-
gency.
It is strange, perhaps, to hear military commands barked
_through quiet Cathedral halls. It is even more strange to see
 a tailor shop, barbershop and mess hall on University prem-
" Vises. But war changes many things and a University is no ex-
ception.
, , We will ﬁnd, probably, when we are removed from the
' i present conﬂict, that many of these changes have lasting
. V p value. If it does nothing m_ore than permanently shake college
 A‘ students from the mental inertia into which they ‘too often
 fall it will have been of service. Never again must college stu-
. .  dents permit the world to slide past them while they remain
" I blissfully unaware of changing events. '

If present changes result in more liberalized educational
opportunities and technical training which is open to all
’ ’ worthy of it, it will have had lasting value.

I Meanwhile, the University today is different from the

i one we knew a year ago. Faculty and students have adjusted

x4 to wartime conditions and will continue to do so as the need
. presents itself. .

 ;~YOUf Personal COntI‘lbUI.'lOn
L Under the sponsorship of The Pitt News and with the co-
;"‘operation of the Women’s and Men’s Health Services, the Red
Cross mobile blood unit will again visit the University in a
ﬂiirive to -obtain 600 or more pints of blood.
 Scheduled for a stay of four days, the unit will arrive on
' May tenth. On this date the students should make all ef-
’.»’,cforts to donate blood to the men in the armed forces.
  Last year a goal of 500 pints of blood was set up, and the
7~drive failed to reach this total by a scant 46 donors. This fail-
 ure came about even tho-ugh 700 students signed up as volun-
teers for blood donations.
.._" However, various reasons tended to reduce this number
' -to the total who actually gave. Some’ were lost in administra-
.’tive congestion; others failed because of physical deﬁciencies;
, , frothers were unable to donate because there was insuﬂi-
" ' cient personnel to accommodate them.
‘Q ‘ I This time there will be no cases of donors lost through
--Tmisarrangement or insufficient and inadequate facilities. The
_;mobile blood unit has been expanded to include more doctors,
 nurses, and aides. This time the unit is even bringing its own
 ds in order to speed up the donations.
:7  , Everything is being done in order to make it as simple as
 possible for students to give their pints of blood. It should
"be made as easy as possible for a student to give this blood, for
it ‘is not an ordinary contribution. It’s a contribution to the
war effort which can’t be bought and can’t be manufactured.
=It’s a more personal contribution than either money or time.
— When a student gives, he will receive a bronze badge to
;wear as a lapel emblem. This will mark him as a soldier on
the home front. This badge should be worn as a medal of honor,
for, although all can give a small percentage actually make the
I sacriﬁce.

If all the students and all the civilians would only under-
stand how painless the procedure is and wha.t inestimable
good the blood plasma is to a wounded soldier, then all goals

 would be surpassed . . . as they well should be.

University Chapel
Is the Symbol of
Spiritual Growth

By .iE'ANNE‘1"rE FELDMAN

To the east of the Cathedral of
Learning, facing University’ Walk,
stands the Heinz Memorial Chapel,
a place of beauty, inspiration, and
thought.

A gift to the University from
Henry John. Heinz and his chil-
dren, the Heinz Chapel was given
as a symbol of spiritual growth, of
man’s reach toward serenity, and,
moreover, as a permanent expres-
sion of the beauty of Ch1*is-‘cg’-ratnity.

Architecture of the Chapel is
based upon the medieval French
Gothic, high pitched vaults, point-
ed arches, and attenuated stone but-
tresses suggesting verticality.
Traceried lancets extending above
the spring of the vaults, and the ap-
parent structural unimportance of
the walls give illusion of great
height. The ﬂeche, pointing 11 ~

ward into space, dramatizing t e.

crossing of nave and transept
within and without the Chapel,
makes the whole- building appear
light, dynamic, soaring. At every
point in close relationship, archi-
tecture, engineering, and art em-
phasize a unity, complex, yet sim-
ple in purpose and effect.‘

Chapel windows, through care-
fully executed patterns of trans-
parent and translucent. glass,
present a pageant in colors that
is a. spiritual symphony.

Heinz Chapel is open to visitors
from 9:00 am. to 5:00 p.m. on all
days except Sundays, when it is
open from 1:30 pm. to 5:00. Each
Sunday at 4:00 o’clock ‘Vesper
Services are conducted by Dr. Wil-
liam R. Farmer, University Chap-
lain. Music is led by the Heinz
Chapel Choir, directed by Theo-
dore M. Finney. The congregation
is composed of people belonging to

Many of the fraternities on
campus have given up social 
tivities for the duration but the ma-
jority of them have decided to keep
up their morale by having parties
and dances for their fraters and
also for the cadets stationed here.
Among those llaving dances for the
cadets this week are the Kappa
Kappa Gammas and Chi Oniegas
who will entertain them tomorrow
night at their houses. The Pi K.
A’s are having a hay ride and
dance and the Delta Tau Deltas
are having a house party tomorrow
night. Also the Lambda C-hi
pledges are holding a dance to-
night for their actives.

Phi Sigma Sigma pledged Doris
Deaktor and Vera Goldspinner to
membership and elected Doris
Kalmenson as Junior panhellenic
representative. Also, Anita Brooks
had a party in her home in honor
of the Phi Sig pledges.

Some 3,823 students, alumni, and faculty of Pitt are in
the service. Four of these have been killed in action, and 21
others died in other ways. According to Alena Horner, assist-
ant to the Univer_sity Editor, who has compiled statistics on
the subject, over half of the enlistments are oﬂicers. A com-

mander in the Navy and 22 lieu-
tenant commanders are included in
the navy group. Not to be outdone,
the army claims its share of oﬁi-
cers with eight full colonels and 41
lieutenant-colonels.

These Pitt men. and women are
not in the service in name only._

Last Sunday two hundred

feature, a mending and shopping
service has been started.

The former restaurant has been
changed into a canteen where the
boys can get anything they ask
for at any time.

The ping pong table on the top
floor saw many champions, and the
swimming pool was crowded with
soldiers all day‘. One boy found an
unused piano, and played to his
hearts content for two hours, while
other music "-fans played class-
icalﬁrecordings in another room.

l Pitt's Long History

itors note; .
,_'”For the cadets who entered the
University. since the last special
issue of the News, this article is
cm. introduction to the school they
have come to know as their home.
On a cold day two years before
_ the creation of the American Con-

.-estitution an important event took

‘place in the small village of Pitts-

E burgh. A school, known in the ﬁrst

' years of its existance as Pitts-
?-burgh Academy, was established.
= The school was the ﬁrst of its sort
‘founded at the pioneer outpost
iwhich later became one of the in-

 dustrial centers of America.

"In 1789, the _academy, which one
-_hundred and ﬁfty years later ex-

gppanded into "one of the nation’s‘
” largest universities, had only reach-

ed the stage where Professor Welch,
«the [first principal, advertised that
he was an ‘instructor in “learned
languages, English, and mathe-

. 0 matiks.”

, ' . By 1819 the school had been re-
?’chartered by the ' state legislature
, as.Western University, of Pennsyl-
vania. Until 1845 it “was located
in downtown Pittsburgh. The
great ﬁre of that year destroyed
it, and recovery was not complete

(until ten years later.

In 1865, Allegheny Observatory

, .

was given to the University by a
group of Pittsburgh citizens, head-
ed by William Thaw.‘

During the nineties the schools
of Medicine, Law, ‘Dentistry, and
Pharmacy, and the school of
Mines and Mining Engineering
were also added. In 1908 under the
administration of Dr. Samuel Mc-
Cormick, the name was changed to
the more appropriate “University
of Pittsburgh.”

John Gabbert Bowman became
Chancellor in 1921 in a period of
severe crisis. Enrollment had
tripled while classroom space re-
mained the same; debts were pil-
ing up, to add to the diﬂiculties.

Dr. Bowmwan met the crisis by
advocating a revolutionary school
building. After much discussion,
his idea was ﬁnally adopted. To--
day, although not yet completed,
Dr. Bowman’s dream is a reality.
The “Cathedral of Learning,” only
structure of its kind in the world,
stands as proof of the success of
his idea. ‘

The enrollment of 1921, which
was approximately 2000 students,
has been greatly increased. Today
the University includes 21 schools
and divisions, and the faculty num-
bers 900 professors and instruc-
tors. ‘

ELAINE K/\HN, Sports Editor

We are struck by the startling portent of a headline in
the Michigan Daily, ordinarily one of the better college papers.

 .‘‘Army Cadets Bolster Michigan Teams” boasts the :ﬁve-col-

. umn streamer. We found this somewhat surprising in that

5 . we were deﬁnitely under the impression that army‘ cadets
‘ — were not permitted to bolster anyone’s teams with the possi-

‘I ble exception of their own. ~
Yet the Michigan story leaves no doubt as to interpreta-
tion of the headline, Paragraph after paragraph gloats over
the good fortune of the Michigan teams in being permitted to

V use the Cadets.

We immediately referred the matter to the Air Corps

A A authorities. They assured us that they knew absolutely noth-

ing about it and as far as Pitt was concerned the Army ban
on Cadets participating in University athletics still stood. The
only thing they could ﬁgure out was that Michigan had a dif-
ferent type of college training program. One that would not be
affected by the ban. 

a Dr. Carlson thought there might be something in the
story after. all. He said that the army had already lifted its
ban on Cadets participating in football, wrestling, boxing, La-
Crosse, or touch football and that this was probably merely a
followup to that ﬁrst opening wedge. The Doctor, however,

' said that he did not see how lifting the order would help Pitt

much in that he is convinced that the war will be over by No-'
vember or December.

Athletic Director Hagan said the whole story was a com-
plete surprise to him and added graciously that all college
papers were not as reliable as our own. , '

:We have since carried the matter direct to Michigan. If
thisis some new kind of sneak play they are attempting, we
intend to smear them at the line of scrimmage. The letters of
-_ explanation should be here any day. Just as soon as we ﬁnd
but “how come” we will let you know.

Every Cloud Has Its, etc.,»Dept.—Just two months ago the

team; the track team is working out in earnest; baseball is

L due to get underway any day now. Apparently God not only at

; cerning our physical education instructors and the Army. It
_-seemst that the soldiers have orders to obey all commands, (if

the commands are properly given). And the army boys here

 insist that they have 'yet to receive a properly given command.

_One of the better stories concerns one of the coaches, who
shall remain nameless. He had the boys extend out and then
didn’t_ know how to get them together again. He meditated and

it '. meditated and ﬁnally in a grand mixture of confusion and dis-
 A gust and with appropriate gestures, shouted, “All right, come

on now, get together, get together.” And there is also the tale
of the instructor who gave the command for the boys to extend
out,—-—but failed to tell them in what direction. The results
were exactly what you’d expect.

The race at ﬁrst base is narrow-
ing down to Red Patterson who has
been hitting the ball at a terriﬁc
clip, but Jim McCullough who al-
ternates between ﬁrst and the out-
ﬁeld, and Cyril Plazak, and Bernard
Pawlowski are playing ﬁne ball and
should not be counted out.

Ed Fisher has things pretty much
his own way at second since Lee
Cover was ruled ineligible, and
Frank Novak looks like the best bet
at third base. There may be better
fielders than Novak, but he has been

— At present, Stickel has entered three teams, with the
contestants to be named by April 12. ln the sprint relay, a
distance of 440 yards, Bob Smith, Al Peretic, Tom Carr,
Walter Cummins and Burgie Steytler are competing for posi-

high school All-American. list
while at Mt. Lebanon for running
in the 110 and 220. 'Walt Cummins,
latest eddition to the track squad,
prepped at Greensburg, where he
ran the 100 yard dash, the half-
mile relay, and threw the shot and
discus. His relay team captured
WPIAL honors and ranked fourth
in State competition. Cummins also

in

Smith, Peretic, Carr, C-ummins
and Steytler are also trying for
positions in the half-mile relay,
which last year’s Pitt team cap-
tured at the State College Relays.

The sprint medley, which is run
at distances of 440, 220 and 880
yards, will be made up of four of
the following: Red Phillips, Ed

Burns, George Nikas, Bob Smith,

Tom Carr and Sam Camp.

Stickel has as yet not entered.
:2 Shuttle hurdle team, but Ivan
Frey, Harry Clark, Carl Worley,
Michael Kusturiss and Bob Cam-
‘bell are battling for a place on the
team, which in all probability will
he‘ entered.

Pitt also has three men in the
Invitationals. Tom Carr is running
the 100 yard dash, Harry Clark,
-all-—state champ in high hurdles in

3 ‘high school, is entered in the 120

yard high hurdles, and Paul Good-

win, freshman basketball star from

Avalon, will throw the javelin and
discuss.

The new Coach promised to meet
the record Carl Olson set when his
team annexed four championships
in one year. “Olson set a new meet
record of four championship teams
in one year. We’re out to come up
to that,” declared Stickel.

He added that Pitt profited
much by the Cleveland meet. The
ﬁve boys entered in that meet were
running the wrong distances, but
this could not be helped since it
was an invitational aﬁair. '

Right now the Panthers are in
need of high jumpers, pole vault-
ers, and hammer throwers. Pitt.
has never had a hammer thrower
in Intercollegiate competition and
Stickel is looking for some strong-
armed fellows to try their luck.

Mt. Mercy Plays Hostess

Mount Mercy women will play
hostesses to Pitt Freshman Dc-
baters today at 3:30 o’clock. Dis-
cussion will be on the topic of
World Organization. The aﬂirm-
ative will be upheld by Marshall

  An Emergency Organization

 
 

 

 
 

 

Student government at the University was re-
organized last semester to meet war conditions, which
made it impossible for the old Student-Faculty as-
« -sociation to function eﬂiciently.

_ Emergency Student Government Committee was
organized as the result of a resolution introduced by
A1 Mavrinac, 044, to form a representative group of
“not less than ﬁve and not more than ten members
to administer student government for the duration."
Members elected to ESGC by SFA assembly were
Gus Wilde, C43; Lee McFadden, BA44; Abe Blue-
. atone, C44; Al Mavrinac, C44; Betty Toohill, Ed43;
and Esther Berland, C43. Faculty advisers of ESGC
are Theodore W. Biddle, dean of men; Helen Pool
Rush, dean of women; and Dr. John C. Amundson,
assistant professor of history. Under ESGC faculty
members serve only in an advisory capacity; they
have no voting power as they did in SFA.
At a precedent-breaking election February 23,
Esther Berland was elected chairman of ESGC,
‘ﬁlling the vacancy left by Abe Bluestone, former

chairman, who was inducted into the Army Air
Corps. This was the first time a woman has been
elected to ﬁll the highest office in the student gov-

ernment body. Betty Toohill was elected secretary-

treasurer and Bob Sullivan, Ed43, was chosen to
fill the vacancy in ESGC.
Standing committees of ESGC are: appointments,
Irving Leiber, BA44, chairman; social; Elaine Biers-
dorfer, C44, chairman; and statistics, Helen Dines,

Emergency Student Government Committee re-
placed the Student-Faculty association, which con-
sisted of 32 students, 16 independents and 16 fra-
ternity members, and 10 faculty members. With
men leaving for the armed forces in large numbers,
it would have been necessary to conduct almost
weekly elections to maintain the full SFA mem-

are confronted. Moral security is
the theme of the novel. It is. a
contrast to the general run of
family novels, this remaining on
a wholesome plane.

In the line of biography Francis
Biddle’s, “Mr. Justice Holmes" is
one of the best according to Mrs.
H. F. Dice, librarian. This is the
story of Oliver Wendell Holmes as
seen‘ by a prominent ﬁgure in the
legal world, and a personal friend
of Mr. Holmes. The picture of the
juror is a clear, unemotional, por-
trait of a man prominent in recent

history. As the author says, “We
are too close to his day to realize
his import.” Nonetheless, this
sketch of him will help us to realize
it more fully.

The third book needs no introduc-
tion. and the same may be said for
its author. The book is “The Hu-
man Comedy”; the author, William
Saroyan. This is the book on which
the recent movie is based. The story
is one of a family in wartime, the
family of Homer Macauley and the
book captures the modesty of or-
dinary life and better still retains
it. It is a simple novel which achieves
its end, that of the American scene
in wartime. ~

 
  

Members of the Men‘: Debating

Association are working for the
government this year. In coopera-
tion with the War Information
speeches about our allies, the war,
and peace plans. A score of won-
en's clubs and fraternal organiza-
tions have played host to Pitt de-
baton.
, Procedure for  the morale
talks in as follows: Dr. Charles
W. Lamas, head of men’: debate,
receives an invitation from an un-
suspecting organization to send
several speakers to a club meeting.
At the next meeting of the debate
group he announces that the Amal-
gamated Association of Clubwom-
en wishes enlightenment on the
subject, “What are We Fighting
For?” The brilliant young men nod
unconcernedly.

Within a short time most of
them are to be found in the library
surrounded by a stack of books.
They have found it wise to be ab-
solutely sure of the important
facts and statistics of their talks.
A question period follows the
speeches and little escapes the club
members. They have no scruples
about asking embarrassing ques-
tions.

devoted many hours of their semi-

a typical engagement:

“An average group of four ner-

form waiting for the signal to go
ahead. It comes, and each one of us
gets up in his turn and talks for
about eight minutes. The speeches
are all related to each other. By
the time the question period comes
around the listeners are so over-
awed by the weight of our logic
that they ask few questions. (Ed.

Five days later a philanthropic
clubmember is polite enough to
send the boys a note of thanks.

is week the foreign students of the University had an _

unity to meet Mr.’ Samuel J. Mills, Secretary of the Com-
,  Friendly Relations Among Foreign Students.

e‘Committee was ﬁrst organized in 1911 by Dr. John

_. asan adjunct to the YMCA or the foreign section of the
;ld Student Service division. Its purpose is to do everything
sible, through YMCA personnel and people who have travel-

abroad, to make the stay of these

ign students pleasanter and to
ke them feel,at home in Ameri-
colleges and universities.

:‘.‘These students go back to
sir homes and are usually in po-
ons of inﬂuence and promi-
ce,” said Mr. Mills. “The fu-
e policies of ‘these nations lie,
 .8 great extent, in the. hands of
ese students, and their attitude
ward us will be revealed in such
‘icies,’’ , he continued.

Just plain common sense should
ike us realize that we must oﬁer

the opportunities of an aca-
iic training,” stated Mr. Mills.

By CARL EISENBEIS
Pittsburgh’s tribute to Stephen
Collins Foster, located on the Uni-
vers_ity’s Cathedral quadrangle fac-
- ing Schenley Park, stands as one of
the ﬁnest memorials to a composer
ever to be established. It is this
city’s tribute to a modest unassum-
ing son, who wro-te songs which
have become a heritage to the world.
In this building is located the
largestfand most complete collec-
tion of material relating to the com-
poser’s life and works. Concerts,
lectures, and dramatic productions
presented by the University are giv-
en in the Memorial’s large audito-

rium. The building also houses a‘

library containing bibliography
built around the life of Foster, and
an oﬂice which provides working
quarters for Mr. Fletcher Hodges,
Jr., curator of the Hall, and his
staff.

Facing the visitor as he enters
are the'two entrances to the audi-
torium. Over these doors are en-
graved the themes of Foster’s
most famous and best loved
songs, “Old Folks at Home” and
“My Old Kentucky Home.” The’
auditorium seats seven hundred
‘people. It is decorated in ﬂamingo
red, which forms a brilliant con-
trast with the gray stone walls of
the room. * p —

The entire left wing of the Me-
morial is devoted to Stephen -Col-7
lins Foster. A shrine dedicated to
the composer’s memory and the
quarters of the famous Foster Hall
collection are located in this section
of the building.

The shrine is a twelve sided room,
built with aseries of stone arches.
Around the walls, facsimiles of the

MA.7500

“first or earliest obtainable edition
of every published song, composi-
tion, arrangement, and translation
by Stephen Foster so far discover-
ed',"’,_ware displayed. Here also, are
shown many of Foster’s letters and
manuscripts. It is a museum room
as well as a shrine. Windows in
the room are of stained glass, de-
picting the themes of famous Fos-
ter melodies. A

Also in the left wing of the

building is located the library"

room with its bibliography on the
composer’s life and works and his
background——the music, art,,his-
tory, and literature of America’s
middle eighteenth century. A
large portrait of St_ephen Foster
hangs on the library’s west wall.
It was painted by Thomas Hicks
in 1852 and is probably the only
portrait of the composer painted
from life.

The oﬂice, as well as being a
working quarters for the staff of
the Foster Hall Collection, contains
a ﬁreproof vault for the storage of

/rriginal manuscripts, letters, fami-

y records, pictures, and many of
Foster’s personal possessions.
Beneath the auditorium are lo-
cated a large social room, dressing
rooms for performers, and a kitchen.
The social room is used by Univer-
sity organizations for social func-
tions, such as the green arm band
ceremony, and the Panhellenic Re-
ception for freshman women.

The planning and construction
of the Memorial took ten years.
Idea for the building was first
proposed by Mrs. Will Earhart,
then president of the Tuesday
Musical Club of Pittsburgh, in
1927. It was she and her associates
who sponsored the founding of
the memorial. The building came
into being through the efforts of
this organization, the University
of Pittsburgh,land the Foster Me-
morial committee. The University
offered a site for the vmemorial

A sound air raid precaution or-

spring of 1942, building‘ wardens

, . were appointed to take charge of
S air raid precautions for the differ-
ent units of the University.
Dr. Peter Gray, associate pro-
‘,- fessor of biology, has helped dc-~-
velop air raid precautions in the ‘
Cathedral and organize student
' volunteers for participation in the
program; Dr. John C. Amund-
son, assistant professor of his-
tory, served as chief patrol ward-
en in charge of outside patrols on
the University campus.

Dr. Geise became sector air raid

months ago due to changes in zone

tor three includes the campus and
extends from Neville to Daraugh

to Forbes Street. University cam-

Right Combination of the

Initial plans for evacuation of
students and faculty ‘to shelter
areas were complete by June.
1942. Since June. numerous modi-
ﬁcations have been introduced for
greater efﬁcieiic_v. but the great-
est changes were made at the ar-
rival of the ﬁrst army air crew
detachment the latter part of
February, Dr. Geise explained.
Army candidates operate under
their own leadership for air raid
purposes. but fit into the plans
drawn up for them by the Uni-
versity warden. In the two drills
held since their arrival,.the air
crew men have given the student
and faculty bodies a high mark to
shoot at. according to Dr. Geise.

More and more smokers are swinging along
with Chesterﬁeld because they know they can always
depend on this MILDER, BETTER-TASTING cigarette
to give them more smoking pleasure. - V

V Because it is made of the right combination of the y 

world’s best cigarette tobaccos, Chesterfield is known
the world over as the cigarette that SATISFIES. You
