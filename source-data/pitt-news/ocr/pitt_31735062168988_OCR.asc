 Peterson Fired; Students Fume

by BRUCE LEVENSON

Random House students are up-
set over the recent firing of their
resident asistant, Bill Peterson.

Peterson, a third year law stu-
dent at the University, was dis-
missed last Friday by Tower A
head resident Sam Zabec. The in-

censed Random House students cir-

culated petitions and held a meet-
ing Tuesday evening to voice-their
disapproval.

The dismissal was sparked by an
incident that occured at a house
meeting held the evening of Sept.
4. Random House needed ice for
refreshments. Pet e r s o n g a v e
floor counselor Charlie Moyer an
elevator key to go down to the
Towers cafeteria to get ice. A Uni-
‘versity policeman noticed that one
of the elevators was on the dining
room floor. He investigated and
found Moyer there.

 

- leave the dormitory by yesterday

“I was glad to see the police-
man there,” Moyer related. “When
I had done this in the past there
always someone from Saga (Food
Company) to give me the ice. This
time there was no one down there
at all.”

The policeman reported the in-
cident to Saga who in turn inform-

ed the University. Zabec called
Peterson and Moyer. into his of-
fice the following day. He told
them that it was illegal to enter
the cafeteria after closing. Pe-
terson and Moyer both pleaded
ignorance. No action was taken
and they assumed that the mat-
ter was closed.

The following day Zabec‘ re-
quested to meet with Peterson

. again._ The Random House coun-

selor was subsequently handed
his walking papers and ordered to

evening.

“This further asserted that he
was not aware that his actions
were illegal. “I know I've done
this several other times over the
past few years and other counsel-
ors have too.”

Zabec told Peterson that he was
never aware that the practice was
taking place. Peterson feels that
Zabec is “either ignoring what
was obviously going on or naive. ”

Incidentally, Charlie Moyer
was only issued a warning by
Zabec.

Peterson was resident assistant
at Random House last year also,
when the dorm was intramural
bowling champs, awarded the
Spirit Award, and placed second
(by only five points) as the best
living unit. “We had a real good
situation,” Peterson admits.

Eric Erlbaum, the House’s out-
going President speaks highly of
Peterson, “I’ll back up that we
had a good year. -There is no room
for improvement, no reason to ac-
cept another counselor.”

MDC President Nick Gervase
called Peterson, “The best dorm
counselor we had last year.”

Richard Alpert, a Random

House resident could not under-'

stand the firing of Bill Peterson,
“He told us that we had to fol-

low all the rules. He’s the pillar,

of conservatism.”

The Tuesday night meeting in
Random House was to give both
Peterson and Zabec a chance to air
their respective opinions. Zabec
did not show up until late but shed
some new light on the subject.

He based his decision to fire
Peterson on the opinion that he

had a “bad attitude.” Zabec’s con-
clusion rested on four premises:
that Peterson did not wish to at-
tend the annual counselor retreat
this past summer, that Peterson
was late in arriving to the retreat,
that he missed a meeting with Za-
bec and the other resident assis-
tants, and the ice incident.

The counselor retreat,‘ an an-
nual event held to train new re-
sident assistants and discuss pol-
icy, began August 25. Peterson
did not want to attend the meet-
ing because he was working for
the Attorney General of Minne-
sota. “I felt that my job was more
important to my future than the re-‘
treat and told Zabec so. I’d_been

.a counselor last year, so I didn’t

need to be trained.” Zabec told
Peterson that his attendance was
mandatory. ‘

he said to me was, say something

Baker said that President John-

Analyze Its Methods, Goals

by PEGGY ALLEN

There was basic disagreement at the first Stu-
dent Government (SG) meeting Wednesday night
_over how the Student Power Movement should be
run. SG President Ken Schueler spoke about the

_ mov_em_ent, explaining his view of it. “Stud,entPow- _

er is a philosophy,” he explained. “It is based on an
educational theory -— people learn by doing. Apa-
thetic students make apathetic citizens.” He pro-
posed three goals: '1) To gain student rights. Stu-
dents should be allowed to make the decisions that
affect only them; 2) Educational innovation and re-
form, and 3) Fostering the awareness of what the
student is. '

Some of the senators disagreed with his pro-
posed goals and methods. One said he did not be-
lieve that all students want change or are capable
of the responsibility. Another senator said that stu-
dents would not be able to make decisions since
“they are just passing through and who will take
the consequences after they are gone?” He also
objected to a proposal by Liberal Arts Cabinet

member Ken Helecko that the grading system be _

dropped entirely. “We need an impetus,” he stated.
“Three-fourths of the student body wouldn’t do
anything if we didn’t have grades.”

Some of the senators defended Schueler’s ideas.
“Wesley and the others,” said one. “wouldn’t be

win the presidency, he comment-
ed that Nixon has a good chance
since he hasn’t won anything in’
18 years. “I’m a little wary of I
George Wallace though,” Baker |
said with a gleam in his eyes, |
“because as you know the south
is known for its crops of peas, and
peanuts. I’m just a little bit wor-
ried that the south might be giv-
ing us a real nut.”

“I support the presidential can- |

serious note, but if I had been a I
passenger on the Titanic I would I
have supported the captain. In all I

didates, Baker did make one very I

here without us.” The movement to defend floor" 

counselor Bill Peterson was mentioned as an ‘ex-
ample of the student’s interests in their own rights.
“I don't believe that this movement is going on
with the rest of the student body,” said one sena-Z

‘ -tor, but another argued that “there are more-and 

more students getting interested everyday. Last.
week, a group of independent students held, a rally

on the Cathedral lawn. Over 100 attended. It is 5ur ‘

job to get people interested.”

Schueler asked the senators, “ls it so radical to 
just want to make our own decisions? Student Pow- '_ ‘
er means that each individual has a certain worth
and value and he can only have that worth when _
. he can live his life as he wishes.” P

Ken Helecko also spoke to the senators, saying

that the students needed flexibility to choose their.

own majors, courses and rules. He said that Dr. ~
Posvar’s proposal (Pitt News, Sept. 11)‘ “was not a .'
victory for the students. It was just institutionaliz— ;

ing the present system.”

The meeting was very informal. Schueler en—,
couraged discussion as a means of feed back and
a way to formulate new ideas. He dismissed the
meeting early and asked all interested senators to

come to the SG office to discuss the matter person- [ V P

ally. Another meeting will be held next Monday.

FRAT MEN TALK up Greek system at IFC smoker.

  Greeks ‘Impress’ Rushees

“Fraternities provide a good so-

__cial environment. ‘They provide

things to do and things to find.”
This is how one of the 550 fresh-
men attending Wednesday’s IFC
smoker felt about the University’s
fraternity system.

The Pitt News interviewed 15
rushees. Ten rushees ‘definitely
planned to pledge a fraternity and
six of them indicated that speci-

, fic fraternites had already accept-

’ ed them and that they planned to

join them. Five rushees planned to
visit various houses and make a
decision regarding pleding later.

' An out-of-state student believed
that a fraternity would enable
him “to feel closer to the campus
and to have more friends.” Three
others felt that they would find
brotherhood, friendship, and com-

mon interests in a fraternity.

Three of those who knew which
houses they would pledge cited
“the social life and status of be-
ing a fraternity man.”

The rushees were asked what a
typical fraternity man is like. One
said that “there is no typical fra-
ternity man. All fraternities and
their members are different.” An-
other added that fraternity men
“are versatile in all areas of so-
cial life. They’re conscious indi-
viduals.” One believed that
Greeks are “friendly, accommo-
dating, and financially well off.”
Still another thought that the
brothers had to put onfalse fronts
at the smoker to impress rushees,
but still called them “friendly
people.”

Generally, the rushees inter-

who put them in their positions

- in the first place. .

Baker readily admits that this
was at big year for politics, “Es-
pecially if you’re M a o T s e -
Tung,” he added with a smile.

Baker throughout the remainder
of his lecture touched all facts of
our life; from the Interstate High-
way Commission to Pepsi Cola.
He talked about his generation,
and the cultural heroes that he
idolized as a young man. “The
heroes of my day were Rin Tin
Tin, Lassie’s grandfather, and '-
Bing Crosby, a sort of prehistor
ic Wayne Newton. - V -

He ended on. a very serious note
by reading a quote from E. E. Cum-
mings, which concerned the indi-
vidual in today’s- society. “There
are two types of people; most peo-
ple and ourselves. You and I are
human beings; most people, are
snobs. If most people were to be

. born twice they would probably

call it dying. You”and I are not
snobs. we ca'n never be born-
enough. Life, for eternalus, is
now; and now is much too busy I
being a little more than every-
thing to seem anything.”

‘ First Pittsburgh Heart Transplt

Involves University Med School

Bernard Anolik, the first heart
transplant recipient of Pittsburgh,
and the 36th patient on record, is
now in the “Rejection Pheno-

mately ten days after the opera-

it. If he accepts the tissue, his
chance of recuperation is very

Refusing the drafths now an ordinary occurance in Pittsburgh. The I-if

average is three men per week refusing or not showing up for i,I1dllCr"‘-K.‘-'_‘;
tion. Local Board 4 lost 60 per cent of their quota on July‘ 3 when 

three of the five ordered refused to appear.

David Worstell, a Pittsburgh resident who has attended the Uni;
versity of Chicago and is the co-author of the book Living at ‘War, re-’ "ft
fused induction on June 27. ~ 

Members of the resistance oppose the war as a secondary maneu-A 
ver. ‘Their first cause is the refusal to co-operate with the Selective _ 
Service System. Jeremy Mott, who is now serving a four-year prison 
term for refusing to accept his exemption, stated, “Our draft seems tgi +1.
me to be 3 fantastic game. dlV__rding and classifying people into“ arbi‘-‘~ ft
trary groups for our war machine. It is a dreadful game because the ’_‘
losers become slaves, murders, or dead men. Even though I am win- _j:I’=‘
ning this game, since I am being allowed to stay outof the military
through an exemption, I refuse to play any longer. I refuse to cooper- 
ate with conscription.” —  1 .'

Canada is not the answer for many of the resisters. They realize 
that social and political problems cannot be solved by running away -. 
from them to. a different country. Bertholet Brecht once said, “I've  ..

changed countries more than I've changed my shoes and everywhere .1 I
I go I find opposition and no resistance.”

Members of the resistance are often asked why they do not ac- _
cept a Conscientious Objector (CO) exemption. Their answers usually. 
C3}‘l'Y the Same theme. Accepting a C0 exemption is not goingto ﬂ
arouse public attention over the immorality and injustices‘“of con-—i‘,‘Ci;E’;
scription. Furthermore, it would be against the principles of the mem- 
bers of the resistance to cooperate with a military organization like the , 

 

Themethod of resistance is apowerful asset for those who dis.-.1 
agree with the system. According to David Morrison, “Draft resistance‘ 
is themost effective way to dramatize our opposition to the draft_.and ;:_-j.
the Vietnam war. -Draft resistance by young Frenchmen was a sub; - ;,

stantial reason for the French withdrawal from Algeria and it‘-,was- 

. draft resistance that ended the draft in Canada and other countries.» if?‘

Only by outright and open resistance, not evasion, will Congresslevers ‘,4?
consider abolishing it.” .  V 

. Prison is the reward given to the young men who utilize their  7
right to protest by the leaders of our democracy. Marc Levin, a 1967 
graduate from the Universiyty, refused induction on July 3. He was to‘ A _, {.1
attend the University of Minesota Graduate School of Philosophy this" 
term, but with his draft board barking orders to him, he is presently “ ,
holding a job within the University. As far as prison is concerned, .,
Marc said, “I hardly look forward to it, in fact “it scares me, but if you ‘
want to change society, you're going to have to take certain risks. I'm

certainly no martyr, but I just couldn't see myself cooperating any A
more with the draft.” - .

The late President Kennedy once mentioned he hoped that one A

Fight Bill, Fight

It is hard for any man to swallow the harsh rea lities of

 injustice. And it is terribly hard for us to sit idly by and
. "watch a huge wad of that injustice being stuffed down the
throat of Bill Peterson, a resident assistant in the dormitories.

When we look at the facts involved in the firing of Bill
Peterson, we come to the very quick conclusion that some foul
play is afoot. The incident involving the “unlawful” use of an
elevator key and the “illegal entry” into the cafeteria comes
under hazy pretense, for both Peterson and Charlie Moyer,
the Dorm Counselor who was found by the campus police

it in the cafeteria, were ignorant of any regulation forbidding

,,such a case of blatant non—communication should not b
. p 2 against Peterson or Moyer.

But this presents us with the surface realities of the con-

’ troversy. -A question is in order. Bill Peterson was fired. Why

was Charley Moyer just given a warning? This double
standard implies that a value judgement was madeby the
man who did the firing—Sam Zabec.

In fact, Zabec based his decision to fire Peterson on the
opinion that he (Peterson) had a “bad attitude.” Moreover,
Zabec’s conclusion was based on four premises: that Peter-
son did not wish to attend an annual counselor retreat in the
late summer; that Peterson was late in arriving at the retreat;
that he missed a meeting with Zabec and other resident assis-

' tants, and the cafeteria incident.

Reacting to this, Peterson told The Pitt News that his sum-
mer job—it had to be interrupted—was important to his future

,.and that because of his previous experience he “didn’t need

to be trained.” From this basic disagreement, it is obvious that
Zabec and Peterson had their differences.

Beyond this, it is quite interesting to note that s scandal
involving stolen television sets and steroes was uncovered in
Zabec’s dorm house. The scandal was uncovered by Bill Peter-_
son. This would certainly hamper the chances of a warm last-
ing friendship between Zabec and Peterson.

It is damn disturbing to find out that a Resident Assis-

tant was fired on the basis of a value judgement——a value

judgement plagued by the distoritions of personal differences.

The most disturbing aspect of this cruel act, isthat Bill
Peterson is respected by the men of Random House. Past
Random House President Eric Earlbaum said there “is no
room for improvement and no reason to accept another coun-
selor.” Richard Alpert, a Random House resident cound not
understand the firing of Bill Peterson. “He told us that we

‘ had to follow all the rules. He’s the pillar of conservatism.”

Is it just—is it fair—is it right to fire a respected resident
assistant on the basis of the personal whims of Head Resident
Zabec’s value judgement? We think not!

It is with this assertion that The Pitt News demands the
immediate reinstatement of Bill Peterson. If the Housing Of-
fice refuses _to ‘comply with this demand, we urge all residents-
-of Random House to protest this action by refusing to obey or
accept the authority of any newly selected Resident Assistant.

Now is the time to begin the fight for Bill Peterson.

You fatten the lambs with idealistic propaganda,

J.E.W.I.S.H. Asks For Equal Time;

Wants More Campus Recognition

by DAVID ROSENBLUM‘

All right! Enough of this non-
sense! Things have gone far en-
ough. This university has gone
too far with its racial policies.
You can see examples of this overt
racial hostility everywhere you
look: the lowering of the out-of-
state acceptances, the food in the
cafeteria. Things must desist‘. An
end must come to this abhorrent
condition. Towards this aim, there-
fore, I am pleased to announce
the formation of a new student
activist group, henceforth to be
known as J.E.W.I.S.H. (the Join-
ing of Every Westernized Intel-
lectually Stimulated Hebrew).

This group will bedevoted ex-
clusively to the eradication of
all traces of ethno-raciistic pre-
judice at the University of Pitts-
burgh. We of J.E.W.I.S.H. have
seen this racism creep into the
university from the outside world.

Over The Edge

The main cause stems from Ed
Sullivan’s use of Jewish come-
dians on this amateur hour. This
attempt to make all Jews appea'r
to be like Allan King and Jackie

Mason is disgusting and vile; but-

we were not surprised to see the
university pick up the slack in its

attempt to perpetrate intellectual

genocide. Take, as just one exam-
ple, the lowering of the out-of-
state ratio. '

This university became state re-
lated with only one goal in mind:
to exclude as many Jews this side
of Scarsdale as possible. And the
ones who do get accepted, the
chosed of the chosen people,'are
faced with constant harrassment.

They discover that there is no
miniature ‘Wailing Wall, they’re
fed breaded pork chops on Friday
night, they have electricity in their
dorm rooms on Saturday, they’re
given immitation matza on Pass-

over (that the Gentile students eat R

as a token example of liberalism),
and worst of all, they’re given a
Jewish chaplain who seems not
to believe in God. The prejudice
is so blatant that the matza ball
boggles.

To, fight this harrassment, there-
fore, the students of J.E.W.I.S.H.
hereby make the following de-
mands to the entire university :-

1. that the out-of state ratio be
raided to increase the Jewish-
population on campus three hun-
dred per cent every June 6 until
Jack Critchfield’s office reeks of
chicken fat.

2. That all Jewish freshman.

be taught Freshman English ex-
clusively by Jewish graduate as-
sistants (if there are any left af-
ter Dayan starts drafting.

3. That courses in Jewish cul-
ture be taught (not to the Gen-

Sophomores Rap First Issue

Editor, The Pitt News;
The September 9th issue was

another chapter in the continuing -

decline of The Pitt News. The
absurd article on Pitt’s chapter of
the Black Panther Party and Ger-
ald Farber’s pervsion of intel-
lectual discussion were low points
of a typical issue.

The worst, however, was first.
Being 12th century serfs, we’re
gald that the Pitt News found
time to extricate us from bond-
age and enlighten us on the evils
of the University.

To set the record straight, we
respectfully enclose a few facts
that your encyclical forgot to
mention:

—-Pitt?s academic record is one
of the best in the country (and im-
proving all the time)

—The $550 tuition affords Penn-
sylvania students with low and
middle incomes a rare opportun-
ity for a low-cost, high — quality
education.

—Student government exercises
almost total’ control over funds for
extracurricular activities, recog-
nition..of new organizat/ions, so-

    

  

   
  
 

_LawrencejP. LaSpada'
 fr  . - _

—Far from bing callous, the ad-
ministration has been receptive to
student needs. Courses are con-
stantly being changed and up-
graded (eg. this year’s freshman
English).

The Administration has done
well in its quest for academic ex-
cellence. Merely placing students
in decision — making roles will
not guarantee greater academic
excellence. A student at Columbia,
for example, would much rather
have courses approved by Grayson
Kirk than by Mark Rudd. Like-
wise, a student at Pitt would un-
doubtedly favor Wesley Posvar

’ over, say, Paul Stoller!

We do not want -this school tun-
ed into a typical Latin American-
type University. Until such time
as the Administration proves that
it cannot maintain the academic
excellence that it has continual-
ly improved, the cries of student
power are hollow words.

‘Black Actio n’...It’s Cstant Battl

(Editor’s note: This is the second installment of a two-part
series, analyzing not only the new Black Action Society (BAS)
which appeared on __campus in the months following the assassina-
tion of Dr. Martin Luther King, but also the inner-workings of the

University.

(Much of the information has never been presented to the stu-
dent. The student has never known what actually happens here. In
this way, the Pitt News can bring out the truth to the student and
show the administration that it indeed has a vast responsibility to

the student.

by PAUL STOLLER
Editor, The Pitt News
The purpose of the BAS is to “use the tools of education to
help raise our people to an unprecedented level of excellence
and self-respect through our .own efforts,” according to the
groups constitution. One spokesman of the BAS is Curtis Porter,
‘its program chairman. Porter is a tall soft spoken black student
from the Pittsburgh area. Porter and the brothers and sisters of

the BAS believe that “a peo-
ple, until it uses its own tal-
ents, takes pride in its history,
expresses its own culture, and
affirms its own selfhood can
never fulfill itself.” The mem-
bership of the BAS is striving
to foment a cultural revolution
.. to “enlighten an entire peo-

ple.”This cultural revolution says
the BAS -constitution, will be a
“journey to our rediscovery of
ourselves. We will support the as-

' — pirations of our people for broth-

erhood, equality and justice,” as-
serts the BAS. _ I
In light of the fact that the ra-

cist structure of the University of
Pittsburgh has failed to compre-
hend the plight of the Afro—Amer-
ican and in order to survive in the

hostile University environment,

, the ‘BAS issued a number of de-

mands to the administration. The
demands range from the doubling

 of black student enrollment tothe

right of the BAS to interview
prospective black professors in or- .
der to decide whether or not these
future teachers are Negro rather
than black oriented. These de-

Free Concert

 

1' urtiss an-t

mands are essential to the over-
all program of the BAS. They
contend that if “the demands to
alter the University’s negative at-
titude toward the black commun-
ity are not met, the University
should not be allowed to func-
tion.”

Some Success

The black group has met with
some success in pursuading the

administration to implement their
_ demands. The University is in the
process of mapping a new set of
broadly based programs. Unlike
previous programs concerning the
racial situation, the new pro-
grams have been formulated with

the added consultation of the BAS-

Thus the new programs have the
benefit.of a black perspective.
The BAS has also persuaded the
administration to hire black re-
cruiting teams whose task is fo-
cused on increasing black enroll-
ment. Black studies and history
courses a re now offered. The
impetus for all the planning and
the beginning success of these far
raning programs has rested with
the BAS. "

In short, the BAS has been a
constructive, innovative element
in a University community where
the emphasis had been tradition-
ally placed on preserving the stat-
us quo.» The BAS has fomented
change in an atmosphere where
change was once unthinkable.
The Black group has accomplish-
ed this enviable success in mere-
ly three months.

Despite the catalystic effect of

« the BAS, and despite the suc-
cess of the Black group in begin-
ning to eradicate some of the ra-
cist structures at the University,
the white student and faculty re-
action to the group had been‘
somewhat hostile. Whites on cam-
pus are eitherenvious of the over-
night success of the—BAS, or they
claim that the Society is a Black

University lecturer in French
and Italian Barbara Sargent b_e-
lieves that the BAS is a racist

group. In a letter to The Pitt
News, Mrs. Sargent states that
the list of the BAS’s demands is
a “blatant facist document.” The
language lecturer asserts that the
BAS is advocating a black quota
system, and that this quota sys-
tem parallels other racist and fa-
cist groups of the past. “The do-

Mrs. Sargent’s attitude is un-
fortunately accepted by a vast
majority of the student body, and
this trend of ignorance on the

to say the least, regrettable.

BAS Program Chairman Cur-

claim on the basis that she fails

Walter Ulbricht’s popularity,
already non-existent in Western
Europe, has probably reached a
similar status in Czechoslavakia.
Undoubtedly, the pressure ap-
plied by this long time East Ger-
man Stalinist weighed heavily in
Moscow at the moment when the
Kremlin bosses were wrestling
withthe touchy question of inter-
vention in Czechoslavakia.

Ulbricht had reason to com-
plain about the Dubcek govern-
ment. It’s liberalism, combined
with the ostpolitik programs of
West German Kiessenger, had led
to a relaxation of the very thing
to which Ulbricht so desparately
clings: the fear of West Germany.

One thing that particulary pi-
qued Ulbricht was the relative
ease of passage across the one

heavily guarded Czecho—German
border. Removal of many travel
restrictions made it much easier
for Eastern travelers to flee west-
ward by going first to Czechoslo—
vakia and then into West Ger-
man. Unlike other Eastern Eur-
opean comrades, Czechs could
more easily obtain permission to
leave their country. However. as
early as last June, Thomas Mit-
cek and his family, returning
from travel throughout France.
Switzerland and West Germany
photographed Russian t r o o p s
along the Czeck border. They
were there as part of the War-
saw Pact “maneuvers” contigent.

Slow Withdrawal

Now, Soviet occupation troops,
presently engaging in an agon-
izingly slow withdrawal from ma-
jor Czech cities will probably
find themselves quite near these
areas. Their job will be to assist
Czech frontier officials. These
Warsaw Pact occupation forces
will undoubtedly mend the hole
in the iron curtain. New border

facilities will resemble those pre-g

sently in use atother points

Course Evaluation

Have you ever found yourself
trunning around desperately at-
tempting to discover the merits of
a course or the caliber of a pro-
fessor? Did you ever find out two
months after a course starts that
it does not count toward a major?

If ‘so, you should appreciate the
job that the course evaluation com-
mittee of the Academic cabinet is
about to undertake. The cabinet
will begin to evaluate all of the
six hundred and fifty course sec-
tions of the various departments
of the College of Arts and S_cien-
ces.

The evaluation is going to have
three ‘major purposes. The first
reason and of most immediate im-
portance to the students _is a com-
puterized study of the courses.
Every course and teacher in the
College will be evaluated and
discussed in a book to be publish-
ed before registration next fall.
In addition‘ to the computerized
course evaluation there is to be a
personal evaluation of every de-
partment. The department evalu-
ations will aid students in de-

termining majors, and deciding
course procession within a major
field. —

Secondly, Gary Mallinger and

Peggy Wolak, the co—chairmen of.

the committee, hope to start a
policy of self-evaluation among
the departments. The French de-
partment has been doing this for
several years, and now the His-
tory department has also initia-
ted a self-evaluation program.
Hopefully other departments in
the College will soon take on the
responsibility of evaluation pro-
cesses for themselves.

The third major purpose has
more .long ranged possibilities.
The committee chairmen hope
that these types of evaluations
will become influential in deter-
mining tenure for teachers.

In order to accomplish this task
there is a great need for students
willing to work. ‘It is a major
undertaking and will take a large
‘staff of dedicated personal. There
is to be a meeting for those‘ in-
terested in participating at seven
o’clock on Wednesday, Sept. 18,
in 300 SU.

Firing of House Counselor

Therefore Peterson flew to ,

. MDC Viewpoint of Peterson Case «I

Regarding the events in the firing of Bill Peterson, Resident As-'
sistant on the 15th floor of Tower A, the Men’s Dormitory Council
Executive Board has taken the following stand:

1. Bill Peterson is an extremely competent resident assistant.»
In view of the present mood among the residents in Random House,"
it is possible that the would be the most effective resident assistant.

    

 

2. MDC respects the right of the Housing Office to fire an em-
ployee if they deem it necessary for the best of all involved.

Neither MDC nor the student body can condone the anarchy
through “student power” that was preached at the Sept. 10 meeting

in Random House by the SG president who does not even live in the

dorms. He offered no solution other thanoverthrow of the Housing

Office and withdraw] from all dorm activities. This could not’
solve the problem — only make it worse!

4. Random House should not have condemned the Housing Of-A
fice. Had level heads prevailed at the first, the matter could have.

for its non-participation in athletic

stone never shows up,” was a com-
mon saying last year attested

Tower A resident John Cavaluchy.

Many of the -students felt that

this was because Zabec wasn’t ar-

The Pitt News asked Zabec
about these allegations. “I don’t

points.

Especially emphasized was the
quest of the Black Americans for

the attitude of the blacks in the

have got to start back in Africa.
Blacks have to develop an iden-

to Black Power is White Power.
“The two races are speaking from
different stand points,” he said.
“One is from power and the other
is from weakness. Blacks got to
have power, baby.”

The common reaction of the
UCR members was summarized
by Dr. David Bramhall, profes-
sor of economics. Dr. Bramhall
suggested that watching a film
of a “lot of people talking about
the problem” does not solve the
problem.

“We have to keep our meetings
close to definite action,” he ad-

vised. “We must have a dated,’

specific course of action. It’s the
only way to change any part of
the University nature.”

James Cunningham of the So-
ciology Department gave the
group a rundown of the most re-
cent progress made by individual
task forces in specific areas. A
talent bank, “as the first step to-
ward an advocacy center with the
University as a partner,” is in the
planning.

Described, as well, was the
possibility of restructuring th e
credit system of the school of Lib-
eral Arts to allow “students to
work in the field in public
schools in hard—core districts.”

Adds Afro-American Books,

The Bookstore of the University, in response to a suggestion
from the University Committee on Racism (UCR), has set up two
shelves devoted to the Afro-American culture. 

One is a shelf in the Fine Arts Room full of glossy books des,;§§§ .
cribing the components of true African art. Included among them
is a copy of American Negro Art by Cedric Dover, a respected

analyst of African art.

In the main area of the Bookstore is located a larger collection

of books, dealing with “civil rights, racism, black history and other
related topics,” according to John Frasier, the general book buyer%
for non-required books at the Bookstore.

The collection contains_ both hardback and paperback selec-§
tions and for the most part, they are non-fiction. The authors repre-5
sented range from intellectuals like James Baldwin, Martin Lutheri
_1_(ing and Malcolm X to entertainers such as Pearl Bailey and Langs-E

ton Hughes, a jazz musician.

Along with representative writings, the Bookstore is planning;
to bring out_the Black culture through its art. Original native ar
pieces from the Makonde tribe in Kenya are due to arrive for di
 play in'the Fine Arts Room shortly.
 Frasier revealed how the choices for which books were made
 “We used a backlist and a recent list of relevant books. Of course
 we are responsive to the demands of the public.”

Harmon Talks

Len Only Another Body

By ED CONLEY

Len Harmon has all the qualities of a one—man team—he is
the only Panther. Soccer player returning for a third season, he
is the team’s captain, and he plays the all-important position of goalie.
But, one minute of conversation with the senior from Monongahela
will convince anyone that he does not think he’s the whole team.

“I play a different type of game because of my position, but I’m

just another body on the field,”
Harmon emphasizes.

That “other body,” who would
rather talk about his team than
himself, says that the booters will
win this year and that it all start-
ed last fall in a 1-0 loss to Michi-
gan State.

He relates, “That was the key;
we were up for that game. We’re

a limited in skill and have to be up

for every game.”

Harmon feels that ball control
will be important this year. “The
longer you have the ball the more
chances,” the goalie states.

This is why Coach Leo Bemis
has started a new conditioning
program. If anything, Harmon
thinks that he has to work harder
than anyone else. “If I get hurt
I’ll probably have to play, any-
way,” says Harmon.

Playing as a team is another
important factor for this year’s
squad’s success and the captain
thinks this is the Panther’s strong-
est point.

He mentions, “This is my eighth
year of soccer and this team is
close. Usually there are some
groups‘ or “c1iques’ on a team,
but it doesn’t seem that way this
time.”

The team’s veteran would like
to see this “united squad” go to

the NCAA Tourney at the end of
the year, but isn’t about to‘put
his fellow players or himself on
the spot.

“We’d like to go to the NCAA,
but we’re not concerned about
that right now. Our first concern
is Bucknell (the opening opposi-
tion) ,” Harmon says.

He adds, “When I first came
here we looked towards the NCAA
and forgot,about a few games on
the way.” He doesn’t want that
happening again.

Len Harmon has a feeling that
this is the best team he’s been
with here at Pitt. It is unproven,
and a lot of the success will de-
pend on sophomores and fellows
like Conference Lekoma who
haven’t been around as long as
their captain. But, if_ these men
are as eager as the lonely man in
the goal thinks they are, it won’t
be long before they produce.

Alois Set To Pay ’Em Back,
Moves Over to Strong Side 

By MARTHA HARTLE
Art Alois had played 530 minutes of varsity football for
Dave Hart. He can’t wait for number 531.
Alois, senior offensive tackle, gained a lot of experience
in the past two years and now he figures he’s got some paying

back to do.

“I wish I would have known
last year what I know now,” ex-
plained Alois. “Little things you
pick up yourself and things the
coaches tell you all help. I’m real-
ly anxious now and I’m expecial-
ly waiting for a rematch with Art
Thorns (A11-American defensive

tackle from Syracuse). He really
gave me a beating last year.”

The 6’2”, 224 pound two-year
letterman from Pottsbille held
down the split side tackle spot on

the offensive line untile this week._

Now, as a result of an injury to
tight tackle Ed Whittaker, Alois

Rain Plays Havoc With
Gridders, Timetable;
Ground Game Untested

Pittsburgh’s liquid sunshine has thrown ‘one large monkey
wrench into the Panther gridders preparation for the UCLA

opener, only one short week away.

Due to the rain, the gridders have been forced to practive inside

Trees’ gym or on a very slippery
Trees’ field. Both of these have
hindered the pre-game strategy
and conditioning. “The rain has
prevented us from doing a lot of
things that we had hoped on ac-
complishing before UCLA,” said
head coach": Bill Neal.

“We need to keep our young
players under a constant game-
type pressure and this we can’t
do inside in sneakers,” he contin-
ued. “Our running game and our
offensive line play can’t be test-
ed until we can work on it our-
side. Also, we need the outdoors
to work on improving our overall
quickness.”

Wednesday night’s “secret”
scrimmage was also rained out,
much to the chagrin of head coach
Dave Hart. “We needed that scri-
mage badly,” he said. “It was go-
ing to give us an opportunity to
work out under the lights, and with
officials calling the game.”

The main concern of Hart has

been the Panther’s running game,
or lack of it.“We’ve got to estab-
lish a strong running attack, or
We’re not going to be able _to
move the ball consistently,’-’ sta-

RMON . 

ted Hart firmly. “We’ve got some
big, strong backs who know how
to run, but the holes aren’t there.”

Also adding to Hart’s troubles
are the injuries to offensive tackle,
Ed Whittaker, wingback J. D.
Lewis and Dave Dibbley, the
prowler. Lewis, who suffered a
slight shoulder separation,'is need-
ed for his speed and fine hands,
expecially on punts and kick-off
returns.

SSOPHOMORE TONY Esposito conditions himself to the rough hand-_
ling he’ll receive at the line of scrimmage. Esposito currently shares V
the blue jersey at fullback with junior Jeff Brown, but he. is fast im-. 

proving.

Freshman Footballers Run A
First Play Again and Again

Before three fans and a dog Wednesday, the Cubs pulled ‘A

of play number 26. ,

In doing so, the freshman footballers, none of whom were at all s
awed by the big black shag dog that roamed the Utility Field, took S-
their first big step towards West Virginia University. * --

Play number 26, an off-tackle run, was play number one. 2.

“This is the first play they’re learning,” said frosh ‘football coach
Carl Kokor, “and they’re going to work on it until they can run it with-

their eyes closed.”

Kokor is in no rush to see his young freshmen, just months out of
high school, confused any more than they already are. V

We’re going to take our good old time,” explained Kokor. “We’re
going to learn one play at a time. I’d rather see them run five plays
at great efficiency,” he continued, “instead of throwing all the plays
at them at once, a_nd confusing them.” . ‘ -

of the 1968 Panthers as ‘pseudo
old.’ “We’re going back to the
old type of power attack. We have
the basics for running inside too.”

As for all the good publicity
the team has been getting, Art’s
all for " it. “Publicity will help
the kids a bit. It’ll give them some-
thing to look forward to, some-
thing to shoot for.”

Right now, Art and the rest of
the Panthers are shooting for UC-
LA next Saturday. “If'we beat

The “jam session” is probably

 _ the most pleasing of’ happenings

that a true lover of music could
experience. But due to the compli-

cations of big business and com-
’ mercialism, such events are rearly
. put into plastic. When the famous

musicians of various gourps get
together to “jam,” the public is
deprived of the true beauty of spon-
taneous creation from the hands
and souls of their musical heroes.

Recently a small _revolutionary
band of these musical greats got
together at the Columbia Record-

ii ing Studios and produced an al-

burn that bore new sounds from
the spontaneous generation of de-
dication to the art of musical crea-
tivity . . . . . Super Session!

The Titans of Super Session are
Al Kooper on organ and vocals.
Mike Bloomfield on guitar, and
Steve Stills on guitar. One side of
Super Session matches the skills
are different and unique in the
electric blues scene lending to each
side of this album a separate, tan-
talizing trance.

‘ The Bloomfield side of Super
Session is pure ‘blues in the tra-
dition of the “hot” clubs of Chic-

speed, timing and phrasing are at
their best . . .
their best . . . . no other white
blues guitar could cry like his.
With Kooper’s magic fingers on
the keyboards, the sounds produc-
ed range from arousing tingles to
spiritually upsetting wails . . . .
but the music is always pure and
honest to the tradition of blues.

Steve Stills produces a simple,
pleasant sound on his side of Su-
per Session as Kooper is heard
less. Stills displays influences of
Nashville, San Francisco, Liver-
pool, and Chicago. His sounds are
diverse from cut to cut and al-
though not all of the songs are
“sessions” originals,” Stills’ ren-
ditions make them pleasing and
open _to new interpretations. His
use of the “wah-wah” pedal in
“Season of Witch” (revised from
Donovan) is simply astonishing.

The only impure aspect of Su-
per Session is what the liner notes
call “horns added as an after-
thought.” But the brass arrange-
ments lack nothing in quality and
in most cases make the songs more
attractive to the listener.

Super Session is the album music
aesthetists have been longing for
. it is a good collection of
what the blues and jam sessions
are all about.

,“LaMancha’.’
Appearing At
The Nixon

The unconventional Man of La
Mancha, winner of the Tony and
New York Drama Critics’ Awards
as “Best Broadway Musical,” is
now appearing at the Nixon Thea-
tre.

According to the author, Dale
Wasserman, this play began as the

‘ stage version Don Quixote. It turn-V

ed into an examination of the spir-
it of Quixote’s creator, an inter-
weaving of the two identities—that
of the wirter and his invention.

Miguel de Cervantes, author of
Don Quixote, was a man dogged
by misfortune, but for author Was-
serman, that was much beside the
point. What fascinated him was
that the upsets of Cervantes’ ex-
istence never dimmed the bright-
ness of his vision. E

“Here then,” states Wasserman,
“I found the scheme for Man of La
Mancha, and ardent, passionate
plea for illusion. as the most mean-
ingful function of man’s imagina-
tion.”

“Brilliant,” “inspiring,” and the
“greatest musical of the decade,”
are some of the terms used to des-
cribe this musical, which includ-
es such show-stopping tunes as
“What Does He Want «at Me,”and
“The Impossible Dream.”

Poor Films Rise As ‘

N e<wTides Of ‘Art’

By BARBARA MARKOWITZ '

Movies are intellectual these
days. Lately, even rotten movies
are making a pretense of being
“art.” The Conquerer Worm is not
a “good" movie by today’s stand-
ards. What it is is an entertain-
ing,‘infuriating, and effective mov-
ie.

The Conquerer Worm is an adap-
tation of an Edgar Allen Poe story.
While Poe’s writing does not lend
itself readily to the film media,
the movie does a credible .job. It
manages to present a vivid picture
‘of witch-hunting in merry ‘old
England. It achieved its effective-
ness through lack of special visual
or technical effects.

The movie is interesting for its
shocking, if‘ not totally authentic,’
historical detail. One scene, of
an actual test used to determine
witches is especially good. The
test for whitches was to throw them
in a lake. If they floated or tried
to save themselves, they
were proven guilty. If they sank
they were proven innocent (but
they drowned in the process.)
Either way, they lost.

"The Conquerer Worm’s only ac-
tor of note is Vincent Price, stand-
ard character of Poe “B” movies.
Price’s performance asthe hypo-
critical whitch—hunter vascillates

from high camp to quite good.
At times I wondered whether he
wasn’t doing the whole thing
tongue - in - check.

The supporting actors, all un-
known, were adequate.

The Conquerer Worm won’t win .

any academy awards. It will pro-
bably eventually turn up on Chil-
ler Theatre. It says nothing pro-
found, but it. is an entertaining
movie.
