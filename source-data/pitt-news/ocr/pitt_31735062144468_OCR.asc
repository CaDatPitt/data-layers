Paralysis Fight
Told in Article

What Pittsburgh can do in an
emergency is the subject of an
article, “The Community Fights
Polio,” in the new University

_ quarterly Pitt.

“The ﬁght against polio is a
story -of all-out cooperation of the
medical resources of an entire
community,” an -editor’s note
states. “The article is a kind of
diaryrecording a community vic-
tory.”

It was written -by Margaret

. Avery, director of nursing service

at the Municipal hospital, and
Elizabeth Sachs, assistant profes-

V . sor of Pitt’s -School of Nursing. It
tells how doctors, nurses, medical

groups, service units, church
guilds, individuals. and even ﬁre
departments got together to ﬁght
polio. Not only the city, but places
as far away as New Castle helped
ﬁght the siege.

On June 16 the Municipal Hos-
pital -admitted i-ts ﬁrst polio case.

Recently, a group of university presidents wrote an open

This suggestion should strike a receptive note in the

minds /if free-thinking Americans. Planning for the peace while
the War is still going full blast seems rather like the old cart

certain conditions, at a time when we are unable to forsee just

What those conditions will be.

Undoubtedly, at this time, a majority of Americans favor
peace time military training. We are living in a world at war,
a. a“ world where armed might is the only means of survival.
Although we Americans are not inherently a military-minded

Why do we celebrate Hello Week? Many of you are proba-

Since most of us have

classes here in the Cathedral, we have little opportunity to meet

Frequently, faculty

7 members do not see each other for several months for this same

reason. The Faculty club and Tuck shops also separate the stu-

Quarterly Publishes Articles
On Mexico‘ by Librarian

Cotton growing in Mexico is the
subject of thr-ee articles by Miss
Lorena A. Garloch, chief refer-
ence librarian of the University.
The articles were publish-ed in the
quarterly, Economic Geography,
in 1944. “Cotton in the Economy
of Mexico” is the title of the ﬁrst
of the series.

“Mexico,” she writes, “so closely
associated with corn and oil but
so seldom with cotton, raises 9.57
p-er -cent of the total Latin Ameri-
can pro-duction. Cottonis the most
important commercial crop in
Mexico and it is the second crop

in money value, being surpassed
only by corn.”

Cotton has been cultivated in
Mexico from time immemorial,
sh-e states. Prior to the advent of
the Aztecs into the Valley of
Mexico, their predecessors knew
and practiced the art of cotton
spinning. It seems probable that
in Mexico as in Asia, cotton clothes
were worn at a time when they
were unknown in Europe.

Later articles deal with the ag-
ri-cultural economy and develop-
ment of the Laguna region of
Mexico.

“This Hello Week seems to be
causing quite a discussion around

was sitting in the Blue Tuck shop

for cigarettes. I don’t know
whether it was the mad rush or
the cigarettes that brought on this
remark. Either way it makes no
difference. There’s no connection

before he made that little state-

booth from us glared at him,
dropped their knife and fork re-

“Be more speciﬁc, bub!”
There’s nothing like getting in-
volved in ﬁsticuffs to liven your
day. Quiet-like, with all good will

toward men, I sat and listened to

the ensuing conversation.

Willie: I was merely telling my
companion (me) that some people

Willie: (voice still weak) Yes,

The two fellas rise at this point,
bestow a general look of pity and
disgust on Master Willie and walk
grandly out of the T.S.

By this time, Willie looks as
though he just had an attack of

Drop Reported

In Business

Index of business in the Pitts-
burgh district tumbled from 178.5
per cent of the 1935-39 average in
the week ended January 20 to
171.9 last week, according to the
Bureau of Business Research at
Pitt. Pronounced decreases in rail
shipments and in operating rates
of many of the major industries
account for most of the decline.

Steel ingot production was down
somewhat last week, and there
was a further drop this week.
Likewise, ﬁnishing mill schedules
were lower last week; no change
was reported in the number of
active blast furnaces. Both bitu-
minous coal production and elec-
tric power output decreased. River
tonnage increased a little, but the
gain was more than offset by the
large decrease in rail traffic.

EVERY seaman and oiiicer aboard our Navy’s ﬁghting ships
instantly hears the call to action, follows the battle’s progress
over a special type of announcing system made by Western
Electric.

On carriers the entire crew, topside and below deck to
oilers and ammunition passers, can hear ﬁrst-hand accounts
direct from the pilots themselves on how it went "upstairs.”

Meeting the communication needs of our armed forces re-
quires all available manpower and manufacturing facilities.
That’s why telephone equipment cannot now be built for
civilian use. After the war, Bell Laboratories’ scientists
and workers at Western Electric will turn again to their
peacetime jobs of designing and making telephone equipment
for the Bell System.

By Ursula Halloran

Lenchner is spreading rumors
of a scoop this week. We don’t be-
lieve it ourselves; he’s just be-
ing an Eager Beaver because he’ll
be leaving for the army soon.

But to get on with this, latest
Delt pin to leave the Shelter is
Bob Cahoon’s. The wearer is Phi
Mu prexy Gerry McGaw. The Big
Event happened after the Phi Mu’s
party at the William Penn’s Ter-
race room Saturday night.

Ann Follansbee’s back from a
vacation trip to New York, seeing
Bergie Steytler. She has great
tales of the bands she heard-Les

Basie, and such. Says ‘nothing
about where these bands were,
but rest assured she wasn’t at the
movies.

‘That duo we mentioned a few
weeks back, Shirley Jennings and
Johnnie Ridinger, are still doing
the town with that dreamy 1-ook
about them. They were hitting_
Mazur’s Friday night and the Uni-
versity club on Saturday. Besides
that, she’s wearing both his class
and fraternity rings.

Marian White “is chaperoning
Ruth Fallon on another trip to
Washington to see her Marine,
Ralph Emerson. We have it from
the gal herself that a March
News will bring an announcement
of an engagement ring.

Ensign Ted Bloomer was home
for a while recently, and Lois Fair
was all aglow. Harry Keck, home
from the army, made a dramatic
exit with Len Matona.k—in the
navy now—from The Pitt News
banquet last Wednesday night.

January 28th was the date of a
Pitt wedding: Marion Last’s to Sid
Silver, a graduate of Dental
School.

Dent School was well repre-
sented on Saturday night at the

Scullen with Dodie Hurrell. Also
at the University club with the
Tri-Delts we got a look at Marie

ure they both did all right.

It’s the real thing between
Sally Bair and Bob Calhoun. He
pinned her last Friday before

Former Pitt Man,
Given Promotion

From Oahu in the Hawaiian
islands comes word that Herman
Schmidt, who graduated from the
School of Business Administration
in June 1940, has been promoted to
the rank of -captain in the army air
corps. Captain Schmidt was,in-
ductedinto the army in Youngs-
town, Ohio, and received his basic
training at Camp Shelby, Missis-
sippi, where he was in the infantry.
Then he was sent to Oﬁ"1cer’s Can-
didate school at Ft. Benning, Geor-
gia, and in the summer of 1942
when he graduated as a second
lieutenant he went to Ft. Meade.

A few months later Schmidt was
sent to Adjutant General’s school,
where he transferred to the air
corps, and in the spring of 1943 he
graduated as a first lieutenant. He
was stationed for a few months in
California and then left the United
States for Oahu, where he is now
attached to the Adjutant General’s
school.

'Safe Conduct  
For Germans
Arrives Here

A safe conduct for German sol-
diers who wish to surrender has

been received in Pittsburgh. It
was sent from the western front
by Lieutenant John H. McCand1iss
to his father L. C. McCandliss,
head of civil engineering at the
University. ‘

It is printed in German with a
paragraph in English which reads:

“The German soldier who car-
ries this safe‘ conduct is using it

give himself _up. He is to be dis-
armed, to be well looked after, to
receive food and medical atten-

moved from’. the danger zone as
soon as possible.” It carries .a
facsimile of the signature of
Dwight D. Eisenhower and the
words “Supreme Commander, Al-
lied Expeditionary Force.”

The safe conduct has the offi-
cial appearance of a bank note or
.a stock certiﬁcate. It is printed in
‘black on a red ﬁeld superimposed
on white paper. At the tip are
the seals of the United States and
Great Britain. It measures 81%;
by 51/4 inches.

Lieutenant‘ McCandliss was
graduated from the Pitt School
of Engineering in 1943, in Coast
artillery, and later was trans-
ferred to the engineers corps. He
is at present in the 188th Bn.

service on the ,western front in
France and Belgium.

His father was an otﬁcer in the
Fifteenth Engineers during World
War I and led the ﬁrst company of
armed American soldiers ever to
set foot on British soil. The Fif-
teenth Engineers were commanded
by Colonel Jajglwin and his Ad-
jutant was Cafitain, now General,

Brehon Somervell. .

“Y” Starts Freshman Program

A
V

All YMCA‘.freshmen set aside
every Wednesday night, 7:30 to
9:30, and come down to the Ca-
thedral gym on the ground ﬂoor
to participate in the weekly s~port’s
night. The Freshman club which
consists of some 150 men has or-
ganized basketball teams and has

started intra-club competition
Four such teams are under way.
Captains of the teams‘are Bill
Boyd, Mel Snitzer, Bill Mun-
crief and Foster Hages who have
put together squads that are even-
ly matched. Other sports events
which fill the evening’s card are
ping pong and boxing. Morton
Lerner, vice-president of the
Freshman Club, is in charge of
ping pong competition. Boxing has
not taken up much of the program
because of the lack of interest but
indications are that it will soon
swing into high gear.
Y Seeks IF Competition

The Pitt YMCA has organized a
basketball team which is -now
seeking games. Bob Golden is
manager of the Y ﬁve and is try-
ing to gain entrance into the IF
League. The matter is being
brought before the IF council and
a decision is soon expected. The
quintet has already played two
games coming out with a .500
average. Win number 1 was gar-
nered from the Physical Educa-
tion Majors but the down town Y
was too much for the Pitt boys
as they suffered a 59-14 lacing.

Panthers Top
Covenanters

With freshman Dodo Canterna
dropping in 25 points, Doc Carl-

son’s ice cream eaters copped their A

sixth victory of the season by
downing Geneva at Beaver Falls
last Saturday. The game was nip
and tuck all the way, with the
Panthers clinching it in the last
minute and a half of play. Bill
Decenzio, Covenanter c a p t a in,
dropped in 17 points, mostly on
long shots, and played a spark-
ling ﬂoor game. Tay Malarkey,
Pitt captain, played only brieﬂy,
for Doctor Carlson didn’t' want to
aggravate his knee injury. With
the ﬁeld house packed with 2,800
disappointed Geneva rooters, the
score at half-time was 27-27. The
rest of the game was a see-saw
affair until Dodo dropped in two

sleepers in the last minute with

Pitt leading 53-51. That clinched
the contest and spelled another
heart-breaking defeat for Geneva.

course not, but they made the big
time in basketball.

To take the game back to
crowded gyrnnasiums would not
be the answer. Instead, why not
clamp down on the money men
who approach the boys in shorts.
It can be done. Put teeth into
state statutes and let the state’s
attorney prosecute the -offenders.
Then, if the bookies broke the

law, they’d face stiff prison terms

and heavy ﬁnes. Also, they
wouldn’t -be able to “ﬁx” the local
officials, if power in such matters
were in the hands of state au-
thorities. Now -don’t get me wrong.
This will not stop gambling. I
doubt if anything ever will. How-
ever ,it may go a l-ong way to-
ward r-emoving the bad taste that
the sporting “public now has in its
mouth. Fans won’t be leery about
close scores and apt to say that
so-and-so missed a layup pur-
posely. They’ll -know that the
game is on the up-and-up, and

. that the kids racing down the

ﬂoor are playing and ﬁghting to
win. A

Pitt Arranges 10 Games For ’45

IF Basketball °

In Full Swing

The unexpected defeat of the
Phi Eps in their opening basket-
ball game was perhaps the most
outstanding feature of the week.
The Phi Gams, led by Sarules and
Reppert, led all the way and never
gave the highly touted Phi Ep
squad a chance to come within
striking distance. The only bright
spot in the Phi Ep team was Marv
Silverblatt, whose sparkling board
play prevented the score from be-
coming lopsided.

Opening the ‘IF’ basketball sea-
son with a bank, the PiKA’s
trounced the Phi Kaps 55 to 18.
Dominating the play throughout,
the PiKA’s showed that they will
be a strong contender for this
year’s basketball title. Continuing
their victory stride the PiKA’s
won a startling 19-to-8 Victory
over the Phi Gams. The turning
point of this game came when Ray
Reppert twisted his knee and had
to be carried from the floor. From
then on it was just a matter of
time until the PiKA’s sewed up
the game. ' -

The -darkhors-e Delta Tau Delta
fraternity turned in a bright 26-
to—l9 victory over the Phi Delts.
Chuck Beihl,,last year’s varsity
star completely overshadowed all

-the other players on the ﬂoor.

Even the combined effort of the
entire Phi Delt team could not
hold Beihl -down as he tossed a
big 14 points through the hoop.

By Buddy Lenchner and Margie Long

I saw in last week’s News that
Ursula and her stooge, Barnhart
really outdid themselves insulting
me. They must have heard that I
was going to be drafted and got
over-anxious with their caustic
comments. But this week I’m
back to prove that they aren’t too
good as gossip columnists because
I’ve scooped them with this little
item. I ﬁnally met Margie Long!
We sat next to each other at Bill
Humes’ wedding. (Although we’ve
been writing this column together

‘for more than a semester, Margie
A and I just met last week).

The Phi Delts came back to
school this semester with a new
round of oﬂicers. Bill.,Sonnet is
president, Greg Betz, vice-presi-
dent; Dick Smith, treasurer; and

Tom Neff, secretary.

The Phi Eps have added eight
new men to their ranks since the
end of last semester. The newest
brothers are Irv Germeise, Jerry
Josephs, Ed Goldfarb, who.left for
the Navy last week, Lou Myers,
Norm Unius, Bernard Feinberg,
Chuck, Fenstersheib, and Melvin
Snitzer.

The PiKAs celebrated the end of
last semester with a supper dance
at their house on the ﬁnal night of

' ﬁnal week, and that's ﬁnal. They

danced; I went home and slept.

The Pi Lams have been very
busy over the vacation getting
their house repaired and re-paint-
ed. They also had a dance last
week for A1 Marcus, recently dis-
charged from the Marines. I

At least Buddy has a lead for
his column. I suppose it would be
ambiguous to say that I ﬁnally
Well, I said

Rushing is on the ﬁre. right now

and everyone is busy. Still, frats

always have time to make a little
news on the side.
The Chi O’s held initiation on

1 Tuesday, January 23 when they

made actives of Jane Bullions,

Martha Blosser, Jane Mellon, Betty

Lee Gibson, and B. J. Walker.
Delta Zeta initiated Jean Leber-

1 man, Mary Jayne Von Strohe, Ruth

and Shirley Waggoner. Lois Jean
Harries, who attended Pitt last
year, came from N. Y. U. to par-
ticipate in the initiation ceremony.

Founder’s Day for Kappa Alpha
Theta was Saturday, February 3.
The Thetas celebrated with a
luncheon at the College club.

They had a slumber party January

26, and a tea dance for the Delts
is planned for this week.

Hazel Booth will be initiated
into Beta Sigma Omicron on Feb-
ruary 11.

The TPA’s will initiate Loretta
Snyder and Mary Lou Barrett on
Sunday, February 11. A

Phi Sig Mid Donofsky will be
married to Jack Weise on Febru-
ary 11. ,, The fraternity held a
formal on January 26.

And now to all rushing, chair-
men a P. S. from Panhel’s rushing
rules chairman, Georgette Z-inser.
Please follow the rules in Who’s
