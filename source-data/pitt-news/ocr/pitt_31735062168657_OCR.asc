UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

U. S. 0 Vietnamese Policy
Scrutinized By Sen. Morse

by LINDA GOLDSTEIN

“American foreign policy today is the graveyard of
America’s ideals,” proclaimed Senator Wayne Morse’ (D-
Oregon) to a receptive University audience at Wednesday’s
day's noon Public Affairs Series. “You can’t compromise a
principle and have a principle left,” Morse. emphasized. c

“If I passed out examination papers and asked every-
one here ten elementary questions about foreign policy, there
wouldn’t be a passing grade in the room,” Senator Morse declared.
He then proceeded to discuss the “early history leading to the United
States’ involvement in the war in Asia, pointing out that there are
many who say it is no longer important as to how we become

involved.”

«

Morse added that these people who advocate escalating the war
to “whatever degree is necessary to force a surrender assume that
a surrender will produce a peace. They forget that the historic se-
quences leading to U.S. involvement are well known in many capitals
of the countries of the world, both communist and free. They forget
also that a surrender table in Asia will never become a peace table

but only a true table.”

Morse added that the proponents of this philosophy “refuse to

face up to the advice of many
authorities on Asia that forcing
a surrender on American terms
may very well end the major
shooting for a time, while the
resulting aggravated anti-Ameri-
can public opinion "throughout
Asia regroups and retrenches for
the ultimate elimination of all
American intervention in Asian
affairs. _

“I have never asked for any
objective in Asia‘ foreign policy
that President Roosevelt didn’t
ask for in Tehran,” Morse point-
ed out. .

On the current situation in
Vietnam, he said, “I think we
have to admit that every nation

~ in the world now has a vested

stake in ending the Vietnam war.
This should be obvious because
if it is not soon ended, the es-
calation threatens to develop into
an all-Asian war with Russia ﬁ-
nally becoming involved. If that
day should come, World War III
is upon us, out of which will
come no victor.”

Senator Morse declared, “It is ~
my view that the U.S. has lost

its right to insist upon .a bilaterial
negotiating table. It is to be noted

.3 that the offers of the Adminis-I

tration to negotiate are base upon
two premises which are unac-
ceptable to our adversaries: ﬁrst,
that the negotiations should be
bilateral in nature between the
combatants, and second, that they
shall be conducted on the con-
dition precedent that there shall
be acceptance by the enemy of
the existence of two Vietnam
g'overnments—South. as well as
North. Who are we to decree
there should be two governments
in Vietnam?” '

' He pointed out that “there has
never been any doubt that the
military might of the United
States could destroy as much of
Vietnam, Southeast Asia, and
China as we choose to destroy.
But that would. not insure the
establishment of viable govern-
ments that will be pro-United
States. Even in South Korea, 13
years after the end of the war,
we support its government with
ﬁnancial aid, we arm and ﬁnance

R. K. Mellon Donation 

To Create Department
In School of Medicine,

(See editorial “Private Aid and
Univeristy Planning” — Page
Four.)

A grant from the Richard
King M e l l 0 n Charitable
Trusts will enable the Uni-
versity to create a new de-
partment in the School of
Medicine. The $3,230,000 gift
will go towards the establish-
ment of a Department‘ of Neuro-

_ logy.

Acting Chancellor, Dr. David H.
Kurtzman called the gift. “the
ﬁrst major indication that im-
portant contributors will accept
the concept of a public-private
partnership in support ‘of quality
education at low cost to the stu-

Authorizations
For Aid
Available

Authorizations for second term .

scholarships and loans will be
ready Dec. 5, according to Mari-
an Bonney, director of Student
Aid. Students in all ﬁelds except
medicine, dentistry and physical
education should pick up their
slips in 118 SU between Dec. 5
and 16. '

Medical and dental students
should pick up authorizations in
their respective Dean’s Offices on
Jan. 3. Physical education ma-
jors will also receive their au-
thorizations through their depart-_
ment at a later date. Athletic
award students should not come
to the Student Aid Office.

The Student Aid Office is open
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.

dent under the University’s new I

state-related status.

Dr. Kurtzman predicted that
“with such acceptance by the

private sector, Pennsylvania’s uni-5
que. system of providing public‘
education services through pri-«

vate institutions may well pro-

vide Commonwealth _s t u d e n t s. 

with advantages ‘not found in

other higher educational pro--

grams.”

The signiﬁcance of the new
department for Western Penn-
sylvania according to Dean Fran-

cis S. Cheever of the University’s . _ _
medical school, is that it will en- ' ‘Z-7-‘~17

hance the as-gion’s total resources
in an important health science.
The neural sciences cover a broad
spectum of diseases, including

such diseases as ,brain tumors,__,
strokes, multiple sclerosis‘; epilep-
sy, meningitis and parkinsonism-

Faculty will brought to the

University to teach and to re-
search under the program and"

"more medical students from the
region will be encouraged to spe-
cialize in neurology,
Dr. Cheever.

The School of Medicine immed-
iately will begin seeking a “prom”

inent, mature neurologist, hiInself_

an outstanding investigator ca-
pable of attracting other similar
investigators and educators.”

That criterion for a department‘
chairman in neurology was stated ‘

by an Ad Hoc Committee on the
Neural Sciences, which recom-
mended the establishment of a

separate Department of Neuro-

logy.

Philosophy of -Sci_e_fnce Lecture

Ethics and Evolution Studied

“Man’s moral sense arose as
a device to promote adaptibility
to the conditions created by cul-
tural evolution,” Prof. Thomas
Goudge, speaking at the Philoso-
pliy of Science Series, said last"
Monday night. Prof. Goudge,
chairman of the Department of
Philosophy at the University of
Toronto, spoke on “Ethics and
Evolution: A Reapraisal.”

Prof. Goudge discussed the re-
lationship between ethics, cul-
ture, and the evolutionary theory
of Charles Darwin. These rela-
tions were especially _evident in
the works of two post-Darwinian
thinkers, Spencer and Huxley,
who addressed themselves to the
ethical implications of Darwin’s
Evolutionary theory.

In expanding Darwin’s ideas,
I:-ot\h Spencer and Huxley misap-
plied many of the implications
of evolutionary theory to the
evolution of man. They failed to

     

   
 

of view. He described this as an
. ethi¢a1'.$rsterra- in

world, and the cultural processes
oi evolution which characterize
man, Prof. Goudge continued.
Because of this failure, Spen-
cer tried to apply the law of the
survival of the ﬁttest to human
ethical relations, while Huxley
admitted that man’s actions are
based on this phenomenon, but
called for a change to more hu-
man values. Both of these think-
ers ignored the fact that elabor-
ate social traditions, culture,
rather than biological conditions
have come to dominate the pro-
cess of human evolution, accord-
ing to Goudge. ~
Goudge did not entirely rule
out all effects of biology upon
man’s ethical behavior, though.
He felt that Darwin’s major hy-
pothsis, that organs and instincts
survive or disappear upon their
usefulness to the organism, is
useful in explaining what Goudge
referred to as the “moral point

.non-egoisticl’... ~

  

 

versalize rules in guiding their
conduct, (3) impartialin the face
of conﬂicts of interest, and (4)
able to consider the welfare of
all men alike. He felt that the
growth and ‘success of this out-
look has been the result of its
utility in helping man adopt his
culture to new and challenging
environmental conditions. ”
The essential advantage of this
outlook is that it permits men to
step outside of their cultural prej-
udices and consider their situa-
tions objectively. When change is
required they are able to accom-
plish it dispassionately. The so-
ciety that is able to apply_.the
ioral point of View is usually
iore likely to survive and change,
while the rigid, static society can-
not. And as the society survives
and advances, so does the moral
point of View with it. Because
this, Prof. Goudge felt that man
has_ made demonstrable “moral
progress,” in_ the sense that men

did earlier in their history.

Prof. Goudge argued that in
the long run the history of West-
ern civilization has been marked
by such progress. However, he
cautioned that moral progress is
not inevitable or smooth.

Chief among the obstacles mor-
al progress now faces is ideology,
which threatens to replace the
moral point of view in the affairs
of men. Prof. Goudge expressed
the hope that ideology will not
continue to hamper the develop-
ment of the moral point of view,
and that mankind will emerge
from the dangers of this era a
more mature and responsible
species. -

. The source of this grant is particularly encouraging. Many had felt
after the Carnegie Tech-Mellon Institute merger that the great resources
-of the Mellon family would more likely be directed toward Carnegie Tech.
But the famed Pittsburgh family of financiers seems ready to contribute
even though the University now receives extensive aid from the Common-

wealth.

The grant goes to just the type of University project that will still

need private backing despite our state-aid. The gift in many ways dispells
‘the naive protestations of some at the University. They said once we are
state-related the administration would never be able togcommunicate to pri-
vate foundations our need of their donations. Obiviously the Ad Hoc Com-
mittee on the Neural Sciences of the School of Medicine was able to present
their plan to the Mellon Charitable Trust in such a manner so as to make the

ahead. To begin with the School of Medicine is probably the most selective

and prestigous of the schools of the University. Traditionally it has been
able to receive private aid when other-parts of the University have not.
While it is true that the Charitable Trust did recognize our continuing need
for private support this does not mean that we should not expect similar
donations to other schools or to the general fund of the University.
Othtr foundations probably will continue to support University pro-

jects as they have in the past. But they will only do so if they are presented

Morse’s Contradiction  

ONE OF Senator Wayne
‘Morse’s self-proclaimed bi-
ases is that he is a “Burki-
an.” According to Morse, this
means that he believes elect-
ed representatives of a Par-
liamentary body should 
independent of their constit-
uents’ pressures and v-ote on
issues as they perceive the
facts. In this way, says

 Morse, the best interests of

it : the constituents are pre-
' served.

But Morse went on to con-
tradict himself, and in so do-
ing emasculated his plea for
a popular groudswell of re-
pudiation for President John-
son’s Vietnam policies.

Senator Morse decried the
trend of . the executive ex-

‘ clusively formulating foreign
‘ policy, calling for such poli-
cies to be determined by pub-
‘lic opinion. Supposedly, in a
-'-"democracy, the people should
decide foreign policy and
-:....that the administration
" should make “open covenants

 openly arrived at.”

IT WOULD indeed be ideal
if the public could make such

 A decisions, Unfortunately, the

vast majority of Americans
, know little and care less of

international affairs. Such is
traditionally the case in lib-
eral democracies. During a
period of prosperity, the mid-
dle class is interested only in
domestic affairs. Only when
the international pot boils do
people suddenly attain a mo-
dicum of political awareness.

Furthermore, it would be-

too much to expect every
citizen to keep abreast of
trends in every country of
the world in order to make
intelligent decisions. Such is
the job of a Department of
State.

Even Hans Moi'genthau
states in Politics Among Na-
tions that the duty of the
executive in a democracy is
to lead, and not be a mere

barometer of public opinion._

BUT HOW would Senator
Morse have the Vox. populi
exert its pressure? Why via
the Senate, of course. The
Senate, says Morse, should
be consulted before agree-
ments and treaties are made,
to prevent executive domina-
tion of foreign policy.

And here is where Morse
contradicts himself.

If Senators, as elected rep-
resentatives of a parliamen-

 

by Alan Disler

tary body, should stand apart

from their constituents and‘

evaluate issues independent
of grass roots opinion, and
indeed John Kennedy con-
curred in Proﬁles in Courage,
then how will this give con-
trol of foreign policy to the
people?

Senator Morse does not re-'

solve the problem, but rath-
er, exacerbates it by traip-
sing across the country sup-
porting Vietnik candidates,
who, if elected and followed
Morse’s philosophy," would
make up their minds in the
Congress objectively, free of
all prejudice.

effective and imaginative projects which are not only filling gaps in the
University structure, but are also innovations in the educational world. If
in the future private donations slag it would be very wrong to put the blame
at the feet of our image as a state subsidized institution. All tliatwe will
ever need to gain private support are novel and realistic plans that capture
the imagination of the donor. We are sure that state-related or not the
University should be able to produce such ideas.

Editor, The Pitt News:

I have been a student at the
University both undergraduate
and graduate since 1961. In this
period, I have seen a great deal
of change at the University. How-
ever, there is one thing at the
University which remains un-
changed. This is the inefficiency,
ineffectiveness, and poor attitude
of many of those .working in the
student affairs area at the Uni-
versity. I

I have just returned to the
University from completing re-
search for my Master’s thesis.
Since I will be here for only a

‘ short period, I sought to stay in

the Towers. Upon inquiry, I
found that facilities might be
available, but no prior arrange-
ments could be made. I arrived
at the University at 4:30 in the
afternoon to ﬁnd it was too late
to secure a room until the fol-
lowing day. The following day
when I went- to make arrange-

_ments for a room I was inform-

ed that I would have to pay $26‘
for a health insurance policy I
don't need, since I have more
than adequate coverage. I ﬁnd
the imposition -of such a fee
which increases the cost of my
stay 50 per cent for this three-
week period arbitrary and un-
justifiable, particularly _in light
of the fact that I will be leaving
the University permanantly in
three Weeks.

In spite of this, I signed the
contract and paid my bill only to
ﬁnd that I could not gain ad-
mittance to my room until the
house counselor returned from
classes. Upon complaining, I was
informed that the University was
doing me a favor by letting me
stay in the Towers. '

It seems to /be the attitude of
many of those serving in the
student affairs area that they are
doing the students a favor. Cer-
tainly it is obvious that they are
here to provide service. Evident-
ly there are some on the staff
who have not yet realized this.
As a student in this University
I have a right to expect cour-
teous, efficient service in a mat-
ter of this kind, which I did not
receive.

It is long past time that some-

thing was done about _the inef-

fectiveness and inefficiency of
those responsible for matters like
this. As an undergraduate I
served on the Student Affairs
Committee, and I know of the
futile attempts of many students
to bring about change. The Uni-
versity avoids dealing with its
students’ complaints bystalling
until- those who complain become

student leadership for failing to
bring about change, because it is

impossible to effect change in ‘

one year with an administration
that does as it pleases over the
objections of student leaders by
stalling until they are_out of of-
ﬁce. The lack of continuity and
limited terms of office for stu-
dent leaders may be the chief-
cause of the impotency of Pitt
students in bringing about change.

This experience that I have
been through in the long run is
only a small matter. However, I
have made my opinion about the
absurd charge of $26 over and
above the cost of a room in the
dormitory for three weeks, direct-
ly to the Office of the Dean o-f
Student Affairs. I was told by
John Vrana, administrative assis-
tant to Miss Helen Pool Rush,
that the matter was already be-
ing studied, but at present noth-
ing could be done. Mr. Vrana in-
dicated that the administration is
aware of the fact that it compels
students living in the dormitories
to purchase insurance which in
a signiﬁcant number of cases dup-
licates coverage they already

have. Yet the University con-I
tinues this practice which costs‘

the students an unnecessary sum.

I wonder when the University-
will stop studying change and
make some. Certainly a good
deal of change is long overdue.
But the change that is coming_
doesn’t seem to be in the right

.direction..The proposals for the

construction of dormitories in the
area of the Stadium is another
example of inadequate even pre-
posterous “educational plan-
ning.” It may be ﬁnancially ad-
vantageous to build in this area,
but it will be more than an in-
convenience to the student climb-
ing the hill after a date at 1:30
a.m. on a snowy winter night. Or
will there be bus service at that
hour? This is an example of the

lack of concern the University

shows for its students.

Having spent ﬁve years here
and receiving two degrees, I re-
gret that I must leave with the
impression that the University
administration is arbitrary and
inefficient. As an alumnus I feel
that I cannot support a Universi-
ty which shows such .a blatant
lack of interest in student wel-
f3re- Judging by the meager
alumni support of the past sev-
eral years I conclude others have
similar feelings. I wonder what

Jim LaVal1ey’s 26 points and 20 rebounds paced the
"Panther basketball team to an opening game 69-58 win over
Carnegie Tech last night at the Field House.

LaValley put the cagers in front at the "outset with a
.20. foot jumper and they were never headed. Only once was
" their lead threatened. With 3:25 left in the game, Tech had

, and apparently had gained the
‘momentum.
Coach Bob Timmons promptly
ordered his team into a freeze.
The cagers responded beautiful-
ly..for a minute and 26 seconds.
" Tech was ﬁnally forced to foul to
/ get the ball, where upon Pete
-Smith converted on the one and
one situation. ‘
“When we went into the freeze,"
’_"-rimmons explained, “they had no
. choice but to foul and we had
I -the one and one to put the game
A away. We can afford to play ball
control when we’re ahead. That’ll
, ,be our pattern for the season.”
V Hopefully the Panthers will be-
_ _in that situation more often. At
"the half, the score was 34-28.

Suther1and’s
Passes Down

Lords, 19-6

The Dorm football season
came to a happy close for
Sutherland House Wednes-
day with a title-clinching victory
over the House of Lords, but
any plans for an intra-city in-
tiamural football playoﬁ have
gone down the drain.

Although the House of Lords
took a 6-0 lead on the ﬁrst play
of the game by returning the
opening kickoff 60 yards for »a
touchdown, Sutherland took com-
mand before the ﬁrst quarter

. was over and stayed ahead for a

19-6 win.

The main scoring weapon, in
fact the only scoring weapon, for
the Dorm champs was the pass-
ing combination of Steve Solnoki
to Charles Mross. The duo com-
bined for all 19 points.

In the ﬁrst period, Mross scored
on a 60 yard pass play, then add-
ed the PAT with another recep-
tion. In the second period, Sol-
noki ﬁred 45 yards to Mross-. The
ﬁnal score came in the second
half when the two worked a 30
yard scoring play.

The Sutherland defense was
not to be denied. Both Solnoki
and Mross intercepted passes, but
it was the pass rush of Ross
Landfried and Van Kignes that
contributed the most. Harry Roo-
sevelt was very instrumental in
several key plays which stopped
the House of Lords just when
they were threatening.

However, plans for a “super-
bowl” between the intramural
football champions of the Univer-
sity, Duquesne, and Carnegie
Tech had to be scrubbed for this
year.

Jim Godfrey’, president of Cir-
cle K which was arranging the
whole affair, attributed the fail-
ure to the slowness of the Uni-
versity’s administration to ap-
prove the proposal. '

With the echo of the worst
Panther football‘ season still
ringing in his ears, coach
Dave Hart is a hard to ﬁnd
person because he’s out do-
ing the job he came here to
do. And that’s recruiting high
school gridders.

Even his assistant coaches are
out, trying to persuade boys to
come here. Reliable sources dis-
closed that coach Jim Royer may
be the coach to “sign-up” the ﬁrst
Panther prospect. He is Dave Mc-
Grath, a 6-3, 210 pound end and
linebacker from Altoona, Pa.

“I never had my pride hurt
worst than this year,” Hart said
prior to the Panthers’ ninth de-
feat of the season. ,

“And there’s only one way to
try to do better,” continued Hart,
“and that’s recruit. If we lose
them, it will be because they
couldn’t get into school. Not be-
cause we didn’t recrui .”

Recruiters “sign-up” a prospect
by giving the boy a “letter of in-
tent” which promises the boy a
scholarship if he enrolls at that
particular school.

During the season, Hart start-
ed campaigning for 1967. And
once the season was completed,
his entire staff really dug in to
their biggest job. However, Hart
still received some satisfaction
for the play of several of his top
players.

THE ISSUE:
, "WHAT I WANT TO KNOW, MR. GALVIN, IS ’WHY snoum 12'"

QQI have never seriously considered

WHAT’S GOING ON?

Last week, Bob Byman, University of Illinois stu-
dent, answered a letter from Robert W. Galvin,
Motorola Chairman, which asked: “What's-wrong
with business?". Mr. Byman raised a number of
trenchant issues and this is Mr. Galvin’s first reply.‘
Other points will be tackled in subsequent issues
of this paper.

The exchange is part of a unique dialogue between
campus and corporation—a dialogue that will
continue as long as there are points to be made.
This and similar discussions will be published in
newspapers on over 20 campuses.

Hopefully, this exchange of ideas will help resolve

‘existing differences and serve as a vehicle for
mutual respect and understanding.

Dear Mr. Byman:

My reaction is—perhaps you shouldn’t.
Business isn’t the career for everyone.

But 'let’s explore some of the other

points you raise.

You say that you know how to prepare
for a profession. You receive a certi-
ﬁcate after “x” years in school. And
from that day you’re as much a part of
that profession as anyone else—a doc-

. tor, a lawyer, a teacher. You point out

that there is no such thing as a junior
doctor as there is a junior executive.
You tell me there’s no comparable aca-
demic preparation for the businessman.

Is this completely accurate?

Many young men heading for business
careers remain inschooljfor additional
“x”'years and they, too, receive a certi-
ﬁcate—an MBA, forexample. From the
day any one of them enters the busi-
ness world, he has just as much op-

portunity to make a signiﬁcant mark _

in his field as the intern or young law-
yer has in medicine or law. ,

Initially, he might be called a “junior

exec_utive”——although I have never"

seen that phrase on any organization
chart. In most companies, he will be
hired for a specific job in a speciﬁc
department, not brought in to tour from
accounting to marketing to traffic as
part of an experimental group to see
which /of them survive the others.

I At times, when specialknowledge in a

given business is essential, the man

starts in a training program. Wherever"

corporate law or any other business
vocation,What I want to know of you,

Mr. Galvin, is ‘why should I’?99

—Robert Byman, University of .Illinois

he begins, he will be gaining speciﬁc
experience and learning practical skills
to -help him function more effectively.
Even in this early stage of his career
his intelligence, his awareness, and his
common sense will show the caliber of
man he is . . and he’ll begin to be
known and recognized for his individ-
ual ‘abilities. If he wants action, he’ll
find it—if he’s an action-type person.

Compare the early months of profes-
sions and business. Isn’t the resident or
intern really a junior doctor? And isn’t
the specialist still a “junior” on his first
staff appointment? In his initial two or
three years of practice, how often does
a young lawyer represent his ﬁrm on
major cases?

What happens during this period and
thereafter in-business or in a profession
is largely up to the man. His degree is
no more a guarantee that he will be a
good businessman than an MD. or
LL.B. assures a good physician or coun-
sel. His own motions‘ and judgments
will establish his.personal identity in
the corporate crowd. Men in motion,
with sound ideas, imagination, and
enthusiasrn——are not gray or faceless——
nor can they be made so. It would be a
a poorly managed corporation that
would try.

Business needs many kinds of people,
including lawyers, teachers, and some-
times doctors. I know that many ‘col-
lege men question their possible role
in business in terms of “where is there
a spot for an English major or a history
major?”. In practice, the academic
background of businessmen is quite
varied. Recently “Fortune” surveyed
1,000 businessmen to find that one-
fourth studied engineering, one-fourth
majored in business, a fifth were
social science majors, 12 per cent
majored in ﬁnance or accounting, and
11 per cent had a background in the
humanities. That’s quite a range of
interests, and one that’s essential to the
constantly changing, diverse challenges
confronting today’s businessman.

Look at the opportunities for the Eng-
lish major. Granted, he may have to

look a bit harder than the engineer. But,
there’s plenty of room, as well as a
deﬁnite need, for such a background in
advertising, public relations and em-
ployee relations, marketing and sales,
in companies developing educational
tools, and in ﬁnancial ﬁrms. Every suc-
cessful ﬁrm needs men who know how
to analyze, how to reach conclusions,
and how to communicate.

I cannot give you any foolproof formula ‘

for a successful career in business. I
can promise you that once there, a man
will be judged objectively —— on the

basis of his capabilities and his poten-

tial. While business does not demand
perfection, it does ask for results.

If a “junior” executive wants authority
and responsibility——he’ll get all he is
capable of handling. If he doesn’t want
them, it really'doesn’t make any differ-
ence what letters are after his name. .

Let’s talk more about the’ individual
and business in my next letter.

Robert W. Galvin,
Chairman, Motorola, Inc.
