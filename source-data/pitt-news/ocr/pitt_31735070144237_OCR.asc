Pitt prepared for Port

by Jayson ‘Myers
Staﬂ Writer

As a potential strike looms
over the Port Authority’s nego-
tiations with its transit union, Pitt
has put a plan in place that would
prevent students and employees
from being stranded.

Kent McGaughey, the man-
ager of transportation and travel
at Pitt, said that his department
has created an emergency plan,
should Port ‘Authority employees
decide to strike. . i ‘

The strike might begin as early

as Dec. 1, according to Pght:ran-
sitinfo.com, a Web site dedicated
to providing information con-
cerning the potential bus stop-
page. A

This strike would cause innu-
merable difficulties for Pitt stu-
dents‘ and employees who rely on
this method of transportation to
get to the campus.

Pitt student Brian Frey lives in
Mt. Lebanon, which he said is a
45-minute to one—hour bus com-
mute to campus.

Frey depends on the Port Au-
thority system in order to make

it to campus and has prepared
other plans to get to ‘class in the
event of a strike.

“I’m going to have to get a
ride with my uncle,” said Frey, a
backup plan that Frey ﬁnds in-
convenient. Frey also noted that
his uncle typically relies on Port
Authority as well.

Frey and other commuters,
however, would have access to a
number of University-organized
options if the Port Authority’s
buses, inclines and light rail sys-
tem shut down.

“The University shuttle system

uthority strike

will be enhanced to include routes
into Squirrel Hill, Shadyside and
East liberty,” said McGaughey in
an e-mail interview. These routes
will allow ease of transportation
for those students and employees
who live in those areas.
University commuters will also
have access towhat McGaughey
described as _“neighborhood
gathering points.” These loca-
tions would give commuters who
live outside the Oakland-Squirrel

Hill-Shadyside-East Liberty ra-

dius an easier option for getting
to'Pitt.

iMcGaughey said there will

also be neighborhood gathering

points in Edgewood, Homewood,
Highland Park and Wilkinsburg.

The Port Authority update
on Pitt’s Web site said that buses
would depart from the neighbor-
hood gathering points in half-
hour intervals and would go" di-
rectly to the University, stopping
at the Cathedral of Learning and
Children’s Hospital. Riders de-
posited on Bigelow Boulevard
can then take a Pitt shuttle on a
pre—existing route to other parts
of campus.

Contest's Web site boasts rmore than 100,000 authors

Novel, page 2

“I know I haVen’t paid as much attention
to class as I should have because of this,” said
Troxel.

However, Troxel has managed to ac-
complish something that most people wish
they had time to do. She has written more
than 60,000 words toward a story and plans
to reach at least 80,000 by the end of the
month. 0

According to the rules of National Novel
Writing Month, each participant attempts to
write a 175—page, 50,000—word novel within
one month. While participants may develop
a plot outline prior to the first of the month,
each must only write the actual text within
the designated month. Participants cannot
copy text" from other sources and write a

novel,iratl1e‘r than a memoir, poem, screen‘-i

play or script.

The challenge seeks to encourage people
to overcome the obsession with writing per-
fectly the first time, to put aside their inner
editors and to experience the joy of putting
words down in print.

“It’s especially for the people who say
there’s no way they could do it,” said Troxel.

For a successful completion of the chal-
lenge, participants receive a badge on their
proﬁle for the event’s Web site and a certiﬁ-
cate. Also, authors who complete the chal-
lenge can receive a free copy of their book
in paperback from Cre_ateSpace, a company
which assists people with self-publishing.

This year marks Troxel’s second year at-
tempting ‘the challenge and her first year
completing it 

Geeta Kothati, an English professor at
Pitt, also needed two tries to complete the

I challenge. '

“The first time, the semester got the bet-
ter of me,”; said Kothari. '

The next time, however, Kothati adopt-
ed different methods. She used a plot that
she had previously devised, worked on her

own as opposed to gathering together with

groups of NaNoWriMos and used an Al-
phaSmart Neo, a type of laptop computer
designed speciﬁcally for this kind of 
which allows only the writer to see a few lines
of text and_ minimizes the urge to edit. In a
partnership with Alphasmart, NaNoW1iMo

lends out these computers for a $300 deposit '

and a promise to reach 50,000 words.
4 The process of writingiat this level also
tends to lead to a more disciplined mind, said
Kothari. _
“It’s a good forecast of who is going to be
persistent and who is going to fall behin ,”
she said.
Kothari described her experience writing
that year as therapeutic
“It was like a prayer or .a ritual,” said
Kothari. _ V
Kothari said that she -dedicated her time

each morning to writing
and that having a sup-
portive husband helped
her to finish the book.
“It’s the support sys-
tem at home that makes
it possible,” said Kothari.
“If you’re living with
someone who is going to
make demands on your
time, it won’t wor .”
Also, to help with the

completion of a novel,

the Web site offers a vast
support system on its fo-
rum, in which people meet

I know I haven't paid as and discuss the progress of

much attention to class
“There’s one girl who has
200,000 words written and
sends me random notes of
inspiration,” said Troxel.
NanoWriMos
around the same area also
often participate in write-
ins, in which they gather

spend the night writing and chatting. Each
area has a volunteer municipal liaison who
coordinates these projects.

'A group of 21 ftiends began National

Novel Writing Months, a project in the area A

around San Francisco in July of 1999. Dur-
ing the next few years, the group put up a
Web site, expanded to include thousands of
people and become an international event
with members from around the world. Cur-
rently, the Web__site lists 118,034 registered

Pitt to charge for additional park-and-ride services

Preparations, page 1

Both the enhanced University shuttle
system and the neighborhood gathering
points would be provided without charge

A to all University students and -employees.

Students would also not see an increase to
the security, safety and transportation fee
they pay each semester. McGaughey said
that the cost to the University is not esti-
mable because “it cannot be predicted how
long a possible strike might last.” A

For those who do not fall in the en-

hanced shuttle system operating area and
for whom the neighborhood gathering
point system would not suffice, a park-
and-ride ‘system would also be created.
This would allow commuters to park their
Vehicles in a specific area and catch ,a bus.

The park-and-ride system is a combined .

operation with UPMC, the update said.
Park—and-ride locations would be estab-

lished at »Monroeville Mall, the Strip Dis-

trict, Fifth Avenue Uptown, Sandcastle,

McKnight Road Cinemas, Parkway Center
Mall, South Hills Village and Neville Is-
land.’ '

The park-and-ride locations at Monro-
eville Mall, the Strip District, Fifth Avenue
Uptown and South Hills Village would
have a nominal fee associated; _

McGaughey noted that despite these
plans, the University is not in a position
to recreate the Port Authority bus system.
Port Authority operates with 861 buses a

' Drug-‘free

largest research companies in th
business for over 25 years.

day, and the University could not possibly
expand operations to that point.

“It should be emphasized that everyone
is responsible for their own commute to
campus, and individuals should be making
plans now for a Port Authority work stop-
page,” -said McGaughey.

McGaughey also said that the enhanced
bus system could be initiated swiftly.

“Depending on the amount of advance
notice the Port_ Authority or Local 85 pro-

‘vides, efforts will be made to implement

the system within 48 hours of the work
stoppage occurring,” said McGaughey.

Aside from getting to the University,
students living on campus are also con-
cerned by how the strike might affect cer-
tain aspects of their lives. ‘

“I wouldn’t be able to go to the airport,
and I wouldn’t be able to go home,” fresh-
man Kristine Ellis said of a potential work
stoppage. “_I don’t know that the Univer-
sity would be able to help that.”_

Sam Barnard, a Pitt freshman who lives

on campus, said that she uses Port Author-

ity buses to travel outside of Oakland.
“[The University] needs to offer student

buses that go Downtown,” said Barnard.

put forward the idea for the eye-catching T-

the first of its kind at Pitt.

“Alot of people are working together _

Rutgers' millions

Rutgers irresponsibly sacriﬁces
academics for football j

Ah, Thanksgiving. Amid all
the turkey, stufﬁng and pump-
kin pie, so many of us have for-
gotten the true meaning of this
joyous holiday: football  and
giving thanks, of course.

We have not forgotten the

true meaning of Thanksgiving, I

however. This is why we decid-
ed to get into the holiday spirit
and reflect upon something for
which we are very grateful.

We are thankful that Pitt is
not Rutgers University. Why?
Rutgers has carelessly shelled
out millions and millions of dol-
lars in order to  its dream
of becoming a football power-
house. The problem is that the
money is coming from raising
tuition costs and cutbacks in the
budgets of various academic de-
partments. All of this is taking
place with little to no supervi-
sion from Rutgers University
president Richard McCormick
and the University Board of

_Governors, according to The

New York Times.

Now, Pitt spends its fair share
of money, but Pitt is no Rutgers.
The University would never
spend so much, so irresponsibly
on football. .

According to ESPN, Rut-
gers’ spending included four
multi—million—dollar deals with
football coach Greg ‘Schiano.
McCormick appointed a review
committee last summer after a
local newspaper reported reck-
less and unruly spending at the
university, including “thousands
of dollars in off-the-books
spending, contract sweeteners
and side letters for Schiano that
were not made public,” accord-
ing to ESPN. '

The review committee as-
sessed the situation and issued
a critical report condemning
McCormick for allowing the

athletic department to operate -

without sufﬁcient oversight and
for “too passive in exercising
his authority,” according to the
Times. '
W/e could not agree more. It’s
true that a high—quality sports
program can make a university
much money and increase its
prestige. But tuition should not

increase and academics should .

never be sacriﬁced for the sake

of a few wins.

McCorrnick- seems to have

made achoice: football over the ’

academic well—being of students.
But what McCormick doesn’t
seem to realize is that it does
not have to be either—or. A great
football program can exist with-
out.increa_sing tuition or taking
away from academic budgets.
It wouldn’t be as simple, but
through donations, fund-raising
or investments, Rutgers could
better its football program the

right way. .

But in allowing this situation
to occur, McCormick failed as
a university president and, as a
result, is jeopardizing the scho-
lastic integrity of his institution.
McCormick must reassert him-
self as an authority figure and
take control of the decisions
of the athletic department. He
should put an end to irrespon5
sible spending and put Rutgers
on the path most beneﬁcial to its
students.

This controversy makes us
thankful that Pitt isn’t foolish
enough to spend so much mon-
ey on football. Just basketball.

TI-ECI-IANGE‘. IT 

E‘§l§ii;"L.

by Molly Green

    
 

_ There are many species of
students who traverse the great

campus of the University of

Pittsburgh. Nature dictates that
these species, which are classified
by majo_r,'will ﬁght among’ one

_ another to become- the alpha spe-

cies. Of these, no battle is greater
than that between the science
major and the English major.
Like cats and dogs, science
and English majors have just nev-
er quite gotten along. Biologically
the two are quite different, you
see. The science major is a pecu-
liar creature that generally travels
within packs, or more accurately’,
swarms.. These swarms generally
congregate in “hives,” orylibraries »
speciﬁc to their own kind where
they will agree with one another
that science is the most challeng-
ingof all subjects. ,, '
Much like bees, the science ma-
jor also has a very distinct meth-
od of communication, which
involves words like “allotropes”
and “geometrical isomer.” These
words are used colloquially, as if

they actually have a rightful place
in everyday English language.
English majors, though they
can be quite social at times, often
prefer to work in solitude. This
is not to say that they ‘are not
adaptable, however, as they can
thrive in nearly any environment.
This_, however, has led to many
conﬂicts with the science major,
as the English has a long history

of encroaching on others’ space

— and- science majors are ‘ noto-
riously territorial (see: the secret
biology computer lab complete

2 with color printers).

The’ English major is an ex-
tremely rnoody and sensitive ani-
mal. An hour of brooding time is
typically institutionalized into its

dailyroutine. Most English ma-
jors feel the need to ijustifythat

the work they are doing is just
as important and difﬁcult as the
work being done by other majors,
especially their archrival science
majors. This is done by throwing
out equally large jargon, except
by using words like “obscuran—
tism” and “hermeneutics.” This

assertion of dominance is some— .

times coupled with remarks like,
“Well, when I get my Emmy for
screenwriting, who’ll be laughing

MCT Campus

ajors reign supreme

then?”

Whether these differences are
a result of nature or nurture is
the subject of much ongoing re-
search, as both science and Eng-
lish majors are inherently sub-
merged in separate, conﬂicting
environments.

Observe the habitat of the sci— '

ence major, if you dare venture
to such dark places: a complex
of large industrial looking build-
ings with such brutal architectural
ﬂourishes impersonal and fore-
boding enough for even the most
hardcore of science majors. Such
buildings are usually named after
old rich men or STDs. ‘

Pitt science majors can be seen
creeping in and out of many such
nests, which are plopped across
Tennyson Avenue in a carefully
structured line , — science ma-

jors are ruled by such geometric

patterns, which stimulate the left
half of thebrain and effectively
overpower any and all creative
urges. ,

But beneath that dark, icy ex-
terior, is it possible that there lies

a warm, misunderstood interior? R
I bravely ventured inside to ﬁnd"

out only to discover an equally
drab display of nuclear power

Forceall heathens to celebrate Christmas

by Josh Green

Colummiat

 

Now that the holiday for god-
less heathens is over — not Hal-
loween, but Election Day: Ba-
rack Obama won — it’s time for

Thanksgiving. I thinkiwe all know I

what that means. Fewer  30
days until- Christmas!

To me, Christmas is the most
magical time’ of the year. I recall
baking chocolate chip cookies
with my closest kin as we gazed
out at a sparkling blanket of
white that covered the ground. I’d
sit by the ﬁre with"a cup of hot
cocoa — extra marshmallows, of
course! — and thank my lucky

I stars that there was a time of year
when I got a bunch of stuff with-
out actually doing anything for it.

However, as I get older, the
magic seems to fade. Try as I
might, I have lost the. childlike
wonder that comes with sitting on
Santa’s lap at the mall. I miss that
familiar smell of stale beer and

- beef jerky. It seems that the older
I get, the less Christmas means.

, ' But is it my age? p

I have recently come to real-
ize that there is a war being waged
on this holiest of holidays. Many
call it the War on Christmas. I
have a couple of names for it
myself. Operation ‘Missile Toe.

Frankinsanity.
Hasn’t anyone but me noticed

' that a lot of retail stores no lon--

geriallow their employees‘to say

Web site called DefendChristmas.
com has taken up the cause. They
list all of the “naughty” stores
that no longer greet people with
the right Christmas spirit. Includ-
ed .in the list are CVS, Old Navy,
Staples and Home Depot.
But in defense of Home De-
pot, they do say “Feliz Navidad.”
The Web site also includes in-

formation about a shocking new,

advertisement from the American
Humanist Association. Washing-
ton, D.C. buses will soon carry an
ad proclaiming, “Why believe in a
god? just be good for goodness’
sake.” This just burns me up. First
secular citizens steal science, and

now they wantto steal this sacred
holiday? I mean it’s not like Chris-
tians stole the date and customs
of a pagan holiday in order to
make Christmas more appealing.

Luckily there are heroes like
the people from the Defend
Christmas Web site, especially in
the music business. Christmas
tunes have been played earlier
and earlier on radio stations ev-
ery year. Some stations devote
months solely to these classic
songs. I

This is a great way to get under
the skin of all the Grinches and
Scrooges in our lives. If, at any
point during a Christmas song, a
loved one says they are annoyed
by all the Christmas music, it is
important to disown them, blind-

ifolding them and sending them a

away on a horse. Tar and feathers
work as well. 
Many people have heard the
Trans—Siberian Orchestra-’s ver-
sion of “Carol of the Bells.” This

' is exactly what we need in times

like this. If the humbuggers won’t
accept Christmas peacefully, then

we must rock ’n’ roll them into‘

loving Christmas. This version

of the Ukrainian song displays
brilliantly what Christmas is all‘,
about. '

Imagine babyjesus in the man-
ger with swaddling clothes  and
a sweet mullet. He rocks out and
dives into the arms of Balthazar,
Melchior and Caspar. They crowd
surf him until New Years Eve.
The girl from the Whitesnake
video is present. Just Jesus, the

’Magi and Babes, TCOB.

Another irn ortant son is a
_ P 8
piece called “Christmas Shoes”

v by NewSong. At ﬁrst I was skep-

tical about this one. There is a '
touching element to the song. It
isabout a man who -sees a little
boy at a shoe store trying to buy
something for his dying mother.
The boy cannot afford the shoes,
and so the narrator gives him the
money to pay.

I’m not sure what message
it sends when a father sends his
young boy out into the freez-
ing cold when he is improperly
clothed and clearly doesn’t have
enough money to pay for a pair
of shoes. It seems a bit irrespon-
sible. However, the real mes-
sage comes when the narrator

proclaims in glorious melody, “I

kn'ew that God had sent that little

boy to remind me what Christmas
‘is all about.” A‘

What we have here is a song_

that was written to guilt trip peo-
ple into remembering why we
celebrate this holiday. Mel Gib-
son couldn’t have done it better
himself. 1

During this time of year we

need to remember what is im-

portant. 'I refuse to let a bunch
of people with differing opin-
ions change things. I am so dedi-
cated to the cause that I will not
be spending time with my loved
ones,  them gifts or spread-
ing love of any kind. Forcing
people to say “Merry Christmas”
and making them buy cakes that
say “Happy Birthday Jesus” is all
that matters.‘ Let’s not let these

people turn Christmas into a Si— -

lent Nightmare.

A It is quite clear. The only way
to “spread Christmas cheer is to
force everyone else in the country
to celebrate exactly? the same way
I do. I '

plant-esque classrooms. I ‘ had
hopedito ﬁnd the color printer,
though I’d only heard whispers of
such a place. I’d been overcome
iwith visions of photocopying my

“Invisible Man” notes (symboli-

cally) notonly in black and white,
but in red as well. Alas, wherever
this oasis-among the overwhelm-
ing science desert was located,
it was carefully. shrouded away
from prying English-major eyes.

As my sister -—— a science major to
theend — told me, “It’s _not for
you. ,You’ll never ﬁnd it.”

The habitat of the English.ma—

jor is quite to the contrary. Take”

Pitt Englishmajors, who, for the
most part,iattend classes in the
Cathedral of Learning. Even the
very name suggests something
magical: Young Toni Morrisons
and Franz Kafkas voraciously
reading and writing novels, classi-

cal theory and essays, while their
contemporaries pick at frog en-
trails in Clapp Hall.
DNA sequencing indicates
[that the 4 science major shares
common ancestry with the en-
gineering majors.‘ This would
explain many things, including
the majors’ shared love for mass
quantities of paper, as indicated
by their oversized textbooks and
endless worksheets and index

cards — oh, how the science
majors love their index cards.
To ‘make an analogy, if science
majors are a ferocious pack of
wolves, then engineers are the
sometimes—ferocious-sometimes-
lovable Siberian huskies — one
step above the science major, but
not by much.

Likewise, the history major is
a close ally to the English major,
and the two likely share a com-

ors no match for prowess of English majors

mon ancestor.

There is, of course, the-occa-
sional science—English double ma-
jor. Such creatures are never to be
trusted, though rest assured, they
will get their just rewards (see: the

Divine Comedy, canto 3).

Tired of turkey? Try some 'Spamalot'

by Kieran Layton
Shzfj’ Wrziter

9’

“Monty Python's Spamalot

Benedum Center
Nov. 95 to 30
ﬁckets: $99.50-$73
412-456-6666

This Thanksgiving -holiday,
you might want to pass on that
third serving of stuffing and try
something new. Like spam.

As in the musical-comedy,
“Monty Python’s Spamalot,” of
course.

With only eight
performances,”Spamalot” is a
small opportunity to laugh ‘off
those additional calories.

The show is dubbed as “lov-
ingly ripped-off” from the well-
known ﬁlm, “Monty Python and
the Holy Grail.” The humor of
Monty Python has been attracting
fans for decades, and this show is
no exception. The show also won
the Tony Award for Best Musical
in 2005.

Very loosely based on Arthu-
rian legend, the show follows
rag—tag versions of King Arthur,
Sir Lancelot, Sir Galahad and oth-
ers as they quest to find the Holy
Grail.- On their journey, they en-
counter ﬂatulent Frenchmen, kill-
er ‘rabbits and a diva—fied version
of the Lady of the Lake.

Playing this part on tour is Es-
ther Stilwell, who has been a part
of the National Tour Company
since 2006. Auditioning for the
part in Chicago on a stop during
a touring production of “Cats,”
she said it has been “Spamalot”
ever since. She admits, though,
that shifting from a singing feline
to an ethereal diva was quite a
change.

“I had never done a comedy
[before “Spamalot”]. I was used

to serious stuff like ‘Cats,’” said,

Stilwell. “I was nervous —— I
didn’t know if I would be funny
or not.”

Of course, she said, the more
you try to be funny, the less funny

you are.

Even if you have never seen
not heard Monty Python’s very
particular brand‘ of humor,
Stilwell said the show has fans
who range from die—hard Grail-
ﬁnders to those who simply like
good musical—comedy.

Taking a lavish production like
“Spamalot” requires expert skill
and effort, especially with many
set pieces weighing thousands of
pounds. Moving from theater to
theater presents constant chal-
lenges and obstacles, she said, but
it keeps the show fresh.

“The good thing about trav-
eling and touring is thatyou go
to different theaters and adjust
to every one‘ separately. There’s a
lot of improvisation in the show,
too, so with the show constantly
changing, it makes it so the per-
formance never feels stale,” she
said. A

\While the show’s music cov-
ers a wide variety of styles and
genres, Stilwell’s favorite song
is “Find Your Grail,” which she
performs. ’

“I love [the song]; I love the
gospel style of it, and it is such
a good song vocally. It’s a very
emotionally heightened moment
in the show,” she said.

Stilwell said touring is an
amazing experience, and the cast
is full of good, nice people that
are a pleasure to work with. She
also said Primanti Brothers would
be a definite stop while she is in
Pittsburgh.

As part of the PNC Broadway
Across America — Pittsburgh Se-
ries, “Spamalot” will make its re-
turn visit to the Benedum Center
from Nov. 25 to 30, and Stilwell
said that Pittsburgh ‘audiences
should expect a good time.

“The show is escapism, it’s ab-
surd humor,” she said. “Come to
the show to have a good time and
a good laugh. It’s a good way to
forget about everything that’s go-
ing on in the world right now.”

Perhaps the ultimate solution
to economic crises is merely a
matter of ﬁnding a shrubbery.

complexity.

That’s where the easy description ends

The empirical elemenm of the ﬁlm are, how-
ever, impeccable.

Hoffman is  in his, subtle yet intense
depiction of harrowed artist Caden Cota.rd.
“Synecdoche” spans more than 20 years of
Caden’s life, and Hoffman ages and evolves right:
alongside his character, never with so much a
whiff of  The ﬁlm focuses so square-
ly on Caden — on his subtle psychosis, on the
progression of his various illnesses and especially

on his existential miasrna — that only a power-‘

house performance could have made it all work.

 Hoffman delivers in spades The
supporting cast follows suit, with particularly
strong performances from Samantha Morton
as Caden’s tragic lover Hazel (who lives in-an
eternally burning house) and the stoic, amaz-
ing Dianne Wiest as a character introduced so

‘ “deeply into the film that her charactefs _identity

is almost impossible to ascertain.

In addition, the cinematography of “Syn-
ecdoche” is sharp and effective Kaufman in-
terestingly avoids framing certain scenes in the
manner that would be most obvious Often
presenting the thrust of a scene will be ‘shown
in a quick cutaway shot outside the expected
scope of the scene. This reveals the ﬁlm’s real-
ity to the audience in much the same way that
Caden perceives it (without going so far as to
use a ﬁrst—person perspective), which tightens
some of the distance of the third-person cam-
era and allows the ﬁlm to delve even further into
Cadens psyche. .

But it is the thematic elements of the film

that are simply beyond description in a short re- ,

View such as this. Pages could be written simply
describing the events of the  as each scene
seems to add a completely fresh and unexpected

_layer. Caden’s big theatrical production is initially

supposed to be a true expression of reality, but

It’s not often that an album can make you
want to laugh and cry.

Franks Hoier’s album, Lownr e’?’D0//arr, has a
poetic sense about it The  and harmonica
folk sound lends itself well to the melancholy,
thoughtful and humorous lyrics. There’s gener-
ally a mellow feel as the album drifts through its
10 songs with shades of country

Hoier’s Voice has a genuineness about it that
adds heartfelt tones to the songs Sometimes wa-
vering and other times strong, he’s a great blend
of a bluesy lullaby and an animated folk song.

‘‘\We Both Live in Brooklyn, Babe,” gently
sways through lyrics like, “This feeling’s rainin’
on my roof / Thru my window down into my
room / The moonlight’s shinin’ like your eyes /
The October wind is hummin’ your time.”
Showing off the singer’s lyrical talent, it’s the
kind of song you play when you’re feeling a little
down

Similarly, the lyrics and music of “Ninety-
nine Thoughts” haunt in a ﬂnought-provoking
way. A  melody hovering just above a
steady beat adds to the song’s seemingly hard-

ened wisdom, with lyrics like, “You’Ve got 15
friends smilin’ wide / 14 of ’em’s got something
to hide.”

The album has some fantastic upbeat tracks,
like the humorous “4lst St Blues (You Look
Good to Me).” It’s difficult not to break out in
a smile when you hear lines like, “Baby with a
patch over your right eye / But that left one’s

thing very charming about the way Hoier pres-

Hoffman's 
lonely man
amazes

Synecdoche, page 14

quickly morphs into something of an immedi-
ate retelling of his own life — by the end of the
ﬁlm, there is not only an actor playing him in his
production, but another actor playing the actor
that plays him.

This is all in an effort to express deep truths
about the human condition —— the absurdity of
 the impossibility of true expression
and the looming shade of mortality -7 through
play that so clearly reveals these truths in Caden’s

own life. , ,
\While this sounds incredibly complex, Kauf-

  A, man’s absolute mastery of his craft keeps the

ﬁlm well within his control, never going off the

"H deep end into completely surrealistic territory

and always keeping the’ focus on Caden’s inter-
nal and external struggles. The commentary and
thematic expression in “Synecdoche” are strik-
ingly subtle, though, never becoming preachy or
heavy—handed.

Perhaps the most ‘aspect of “Syn.-
ecdoche” is its almost—overwhelming emotional
poignancy. At no point does Caden lose his
humanity or relevance in the complexity of
the ﬁlm, nor does his melancholy and intensity
ever become suppressed by the ﬁlm’s sprawling
scope. The unconventionality of the ﬁlm works
in its favor here, as the v'iewe1’s complete inability
to predict what will happen next — not neces-
sarily in the context of plot, but in the sense of
the nature of Caden’s next tribulation —— keeps
the viewer vulnerable in the best ‘way possible.

The ﬁlm’s only truly negative point is that it -

is a great deal to digest in one sitting. However,

this is not because the  is  to understand '

but merely because there is so much to the ﬁlm.

‘It lends itself to repeat  rather than

interpretive frustration and certainly has an im-
mense impact even the first time around.

Most ‘know Kaufman from his elegant,
quirky ﬁlms of the last decade (“Being John
Malkovich,” “Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless
Mind”). W/hile those ﬁlms all included surreal-

. ist elements, such as memory erasure in “Sun-

shine” and body inhabitation in “Malkovi ”
“Synecdoche” takes this style much further
—— although it does not quite reach the discon-

V nected, itnagery-heavy quality of well-known
surrealists like David Lynch. Instead, “Synech- -
, doche” inhabits "a middle ground that makes it

almost inscrutable.

in However, “Synechdoche” is ultimately a
musing on time, death and expression —— all
subjects with nuances and meanings even more
inscrutable than the ﬁlm’s style. As with every-

thingin “Synechdoche,” these elements all come’

together to create an ethereal,.transcendent and

extraordinarily relevant experience that must not

be missed.‘

Despite los, ackyard Brawl matters,

Pitt looks  
for eighth
{win Friday

by Emily Steiner
Staﬂ Writer

After Saturday’s crushing, and
some might say deﬁnitive, loss at
Cincinnati, the upcoming game
against West Virginia has lost some
of the signiﬁcance that it’s held all
season for the Pitt football team.

But it’s still the Backyard Brawl. 4

Pitt is going into the game 7-3 on
the season, 3-2 in the Big East and
behind the Mountaineers in the con-
ference  Though a Big East
conference title may be a lost cause,
a win Friday, the 101st meeting of
the two schools, will make last: yea.r’s
13-9 win more credible and lasting.

Since the series began in 1895,
Pitt leads West Virginia, 60-37-3.

The Pittsburgh Panthers and
West Virginia Mountaineers have

. lined up across from each other 100
V times.

However, as Pitt and West Vir-
ginia prepare for a 101st meeting
Friday at noon, only one previous
installment of the Backyard Brawl
is on the minds of players, fans and
analysts.

When Pitt upset West Virginia,
13-9, last season in Morgantown,
\X/.Va., it sent shockwaves across
the college football landscape. Ac-
cording to college football historian
and commentator Beano Cook, last
year’s game rocked the entire Moun-
taineer football program.

“It was_ a very tough defeat for
[West Virginia]. It was more than
losing a football game,” said Cook
“They lost a football coach. They
lost a chance to play for the national
title. It was probably one of the
most devastating defeats in the his-
tory of their program.”

The game springboarded Pitt

into a successful offseason of re-

cruiting and increased expectations
for its 2008 campaign. Now, 10
games into the season, the Panthers
(7-3, 3-2) and Mountaineers (7-3,
4-1) will clash in front of a national
television audience on ABC.

West Virginia coach Bill Stewart
is looking forward to the national
stage and likes the idea of two-sto-
iied programs that are  suc-
cessful seasons squaring off 

“I think it’s a wonderful rivalry,”
said Stewart during a teleconference
on Sunday. “It’s great for college
football that two teams of our stat-
ure are  good years.”

Radio personality Guy Junker
also highlighted the importance of
this game for the Big East — con-
sidering the amount of criticism the
conference has taken lately.

“The Big East is such a young
conference, it doesn’t have mutﬁo

txadition, but to have two teams that «

have played for 100 years adds tradi-
tion to [the Big East],” said Junker.
“If both teams are playing well, that
legitimizes the whole conference.”
Junker will be joined by his co-
host Stan Savran and Cook for a

First Strongman event a success

‘ by JP Hanish
,, Staff Writer

While many Pitt students were curled up
on their couches watching football on Saturday,
several others decided to add some muscle.

T‘ The first annual Pitt Strongman Competi-
tion featured male and female‘ students com-
peting in aivariety of eventsdesigned to test
their strength and heart

john Schneider, the event coordinator, was
eager and excited about the competition when
he started to create the event earlier this year.

“[The goal was] for everyone to be able to.

challenge themselves,” said Schneider.

Though not exactly the events seen on
ESPN, Schneider wanted to create the compe-
tition so students would not be overwhelmed.

‘T-le divided both the men and women into
three separate weight classes, all named after
Greek mythology, and adjusted each event for
them.

One of the events was a farmers walk,
which is a staple in many Strongman competi-
tions. Each participant holds 55- to 150-pound
torpedoes in each hand and walks up and down

21 CO UISC.

In another event, students would carry 

70- to l40—pound stability ball full of water in
,_ atﬁgure-eight formation.

   

The keg clean and one of the more H

impressive events. Students would take a stan-
dard size keg,.half full of water, and thrust it
over their heads as many times as possible in

' a minute.

The water, as Schneider said, was to “throw
off the balance of the keg because when you
lift it, the water goes back and forth.” Students
would then have to stabilize the keg before at-
tempting another lift

In all, students competed in seven different
events over the span of five hours.

66

"[The goal was] for everyone to be
able to challenge themselves. Every-
one really felt like they accomplished
something." a
John _ 9 9
Schneider

The male winners in each division were

Christian Mason in the Hercules division, Zach —
_Miller and David Esmaili in the Orion division

and Nicholas Tate in the Atlas division. The
female winners were Aurielle McCauley in the

Styx division, Bridget Ingram and.Caroline'

Nilsen in the Artimes division and Elizabeth‘

Wyman in the Athena division.

Medals were handed out for each event, and
there was a team competition in which some
of Pitt’s sororities and fraternities competed.

. The team who amassed the most points was
awarded a trophy with its letters engraved in the
base. *

Schneider plans to use the same trophy ev-
ery year and allow the organizations to keep it
until‘ the next competition. This years winner
will be announced soon.

Even though not everyone could win, Sch‘-

neider noted that the participants put a lot of _
_ work into the events
“Everyone really felt like they accomplished"

something,” said Schneider. _

One of the main goals of the entire com-
petition was for students to create a healthier
lifestyle for themselves. 

“If we can do that, then the competition‘

was a real success,” said Schneider. _
Students who would like to compete in next
year’s competition are urged to visit the ‘Web
site at www.in_tramurals.pitt.edu/strongman.’
php. There will be videos of each-event, and
results ‘will be posted soon. Students are also
encouraged to look for advertisements next
September. Help is available at the Baierl Fit-
ness Center for those who are not familiar with
the training regimen. '

NCAA Tournament, when their

Belmont Bruins came within a bas-
ket of knocking off heavilyfavored

- Duke.

This year, the pair looks to do
more than just scare an AP top-25
team when Belmont (1-1) plays Pitt
(4-0) Tuesday night. The Panthers
are the Bruins’ highest ranked op-
ponent since the Blue Devils last
March. ii

And as a mid-rnajor on the road
facing a postseason contender in
Pitt, Belmont once  ﬁnds itself
an underdog.

“We don’t have much to lose,”
said Renﬁroe. “But we look at this
game as we would any other game.
We want to win, and we are going
to do the best we can do to achieve
that.” I -
.Renfroe, W/icke and the Belmont
squad are no strangers to close
games against big-time progra_ms.
In addition to Duke’s narrow 71-70
escape, Belmont defeated Cincinna-
ti, 86-75, and upset Alabama, 85-83,
on the road last year.

Long-time coach Rick Byrd
spearheaded Belmont’s growth into

a powerful rnid-major program.
The Bruins earned their ﬁrst ever
NCAA Tournament bid in 2006, an
automatic one after  their
conference tournament, and they
have repeated the feat the last two
years.

West Virginia's vaunted

rushing attack led by Wite

Saturday. The Panthers hope to bounce back against West Virginia Friday.

season, much more than Mountaineer senior
quarterback Pat White The difference between
the two is a major one — Wl1ite’s versatility and
threat as a rusher, which will be a primary con-
cern for Pitt, especially after failing to handle a
multi—talented quarterback in Cincinnati’s Tony
Pike last week

Pitt coach Dave Wannstedt jokingly said
that he wished White was no longer on the
roster. '

“Pat White is the best spread quarterback
in the country without a doubtj’ said Wannst-
edt. “He can make you miss, and he can out-
run you. He’s going to have the football in his
hands come Friday, and we’re  to have to
deal with him.”

West Virginia (7 -3, 4-1 Big East) comes
off an impressive 35-21 win over Louisville, in
which White ran for 200 yards, becoming the
NCAA’s career quarterback rushing leader.

White averages 87.3 yards per game rushing
and 136.2 passing this season.

“He will throw the ball if you give him the
chance,” said Wannstedt.

After Saturday’s game, West Virginia is now
on a ﬁve-game road-winning streak in Big East

conference play, going back to games against
Syracuse, Rutgers and Cincinnati last season.
And the Mountaineers are looking for more
than just a win against Pitt. Unlike the Panthers,
West Virginia is still playing for a chance at the
Big East crown. A win Friday and  next
week at home against South Florida, along with
a Syracuse upset over Cincinnati, would secure
a top spot for the Mountaineers.
_ In addition to keeping up with White, the
Panthers defense  look to keep West Virgin-

. ia’s leading rusher Noel Devine to fewer yards

than his average of 112.1 yards per game.
“Noel is explosive,” said Wannstedt. “He’s
as quick and as explosive a  back as we

will face all year long”

In‘ this heated game, special teams could
end up playing a major role. This season, the

Panthers have blocked nine kicks in 10 games, '

setting a school record. ~
Keeping up with that trend might be a good

I idea -- the leading scorer for the Mountaineers

is senior kicker Pat McAfee, who has scored 64

points this season. ,
Siirteen seniors will be recognized at Fri-

day’s game, as it will be their last at Heinz

. Field. Among those  recognized are Dave

Brytus, Chase Clowser, Conredge Collins, C].
Davis, Rashaad Duncan, Mark Estermyer,
Adam Gunn, Derek Kinder, Frank Kochin,

Backyard Brawl, page 17

Backyard Brawl pregame show, which will air
live prior to the game in front of Jerome Bet-
tis’ Grille 36. The show will be broadcasted on
ESPN Radio 1250 AM, and fans are encour-
aged to attend the event as part of their tailgat-
ing festivities. ~

The spectacle surrounding this game and
 was enough to take some players by
surprise.,Pitt sophomore defensive end Jabaal
Sheard wasn’t expecting such a heated grudge
match. , '

F “Coming from Florida, I was just surpnsed
how big of a game this is  how much en-
ergy it takes to play  a gamelike this,” said
Sheard.

. Pitt players expect the intensity to be
cranked up even further because of last year’s
result While Stewart refuses to use the term

“revenge,” Pitt kicker Conor Lee knows that '
payback  be on the minds of the Moun—’

taineers.

“We ruinedveverything for them last year,”
said Lee. “They were heading to a national
championship. I’m sure they were 
about that for a whole year, but we’ve been
thinking about it for a long time, too.”

The first Backyard Brawl was in -1895,
and while Pitt holds a 60—37—3 advantage over
West Virginia, the unpredictable nature of

embraced by people outside and inside the

programs.

“Frankly, I believe all the hype that [says]
you can throw out the records,” saidjunker. “I
think no matter what the teams" records are,
they still think it’s a special game.”

Despite the fact that Pitt has been elimi-
nated from Big East title contention, Lee is
conﬁdent that the Panthers will be refocused
when West Virginia comes to town.

“We have a lot of older guys on this team
_and guys that have been playing for a while,

and they understand the importance of play-
ing against West Vir ' ' ” said Lee. “This
game is always a big game for us, it doesn’t
matter what the records are. We showed that
last year. \

“You never know what happens in this
game. We always look forward to it, no matter
what’s at stake.”

Pitt coach Dave Warmstedt said during his
press conference Monday that he cherishes his
involvement in this iivalry in the same man-
ner in which he remembers his participation in

T, 21

never after Pitt's huge upset last year

NFL playoff games and the Super Bowl.
“Before I was coaching here, I’d be some
place with a bunch of buddies and the stones
that would come up would always be about
West Virginia, Penn State and Notre Dame
games,” said Wannstedt; “Those are the
