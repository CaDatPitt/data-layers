the‘fact that‘ the invitation was ex-

The second"annual conference on

highway maintenance and eonstrLic-
tioniheld by the‘School of ‘Civil En-.
gineering‘ in co-operatioii -with the
Pennsylvania State Highway Dépaftr
ment‘ last week, was a complete suc-
cess from' every standpoint. .
The various speakers were men of
recognized ability and this papers pre-
sented were of high caliber. _ Among
the more important papers presented
was “Earth Reoads,”_ by W. A. Wynn,-
maintenance.-en'gineer, Bureau of
‘-Township Highways, Pennsylvania
Highway Department. ’The ‘discus-_
sion _of improved roads causes us of-
ten to lose sight ofpthe fact that for.
many years to come earth roads will‘
compose most of the mileage of our
highway systems. The State -High-
way Department has under its con-
trol some eicrh-ty thousand miles of
[earth roads, and‘ since it costs in the
neighborhood -‘of $20,000.00 21 mile "to.
build permanent highways, it is read-.
-ily‘ seen that earth roads will con-
tinue. to be ‘of, iinpo'r.tan_ce. Mr..-
vWyn1_1’s paper treated of the lsubject
of earth roads inpa most thorough
manner. I ' i -
.Among the more important types of
high ay- surfacing is ‘water-bound and
bituminous bouiid' macac_lai;r1.§ These
two types have been -used for the con-
_structior_i of highwayisgin’ Pennsylva-
nia perhaps more‘ than any other.
‘This important -subject was -treated
._mostl thoroughly" by H._ M, Sharp,
«chief engineer Ohio State Highway
Department. ‘ i
The many conditions» iinposecl -on
’tl1e construct-ion of city streets and
pavements present a problem of__con-'
'sidera'ble.‘ difﬁculty. ‘The manner'in.
which the 'City«o_f'. Pittsburgh is solv-

a

«ing this problem .is, well set forth in ",1l1e"la‘b,o

‘the papeiﬁby H, S. Sprague, chief en-
gineer, Biireau .,.of Engineering, City"
of Pittsburgh- Valuable tables show-
ing”‘the mileage and c’os't3'of_.various'

i ‘A large. turnout of stud__ents and‘.
xmany, ou-tsid-ers greeted Hon-.~.Henry.‘.
_Morgenthau, former Anibassadoiﬁtol
Turkey, — at the fqegular‘ monthly‘ as-'

who is intiniately acquainted with the

’l<ey,, chose‘that<count-ry for the sub-.
‘ject of his. ddr-ess. ' , " . -

That _his- speech was of absorbing
interest “was inanifested by the close
_attention which all the students‘ gave
!to- Mr. Morgen-thau’s remarks.‘ In
vivid‘ words he painted" the‘T'~life, and
habits. of the Turks, their st‘a‘n'd -in the
Ir _ . . . v .
present war, and‘ their treatment of.
ltlie Armenians. Of his _'OWII greatand,

Every reticent and modest. '' . j .
I *  Mo'rgent_hau- did -not attempt to
justify the treatment ~o.f'the Armeni-
ansat the hands’_of. the Turks; he
simply tried to show the view held by

nian people. Heisaid that the Turk-

shoiuld have been desvtroyegli early in

Armenians are still l1i_¥'QXllS't€11"C6. it is
!no fault .of- th-e Turk. I The present

that, ‘in ..addi'tio’,n' to ‘these f_a_ct‘s,v the

that the Armenians were playing -trai-,

cal.SchooAl, I wish to give you the fol-
lowing information regarding the ac-
tivities 'and'whereabouts of Dr. Zink
since the. latter part of the ‘year 1914‘.
[ iDr. Ph_Ailip Zi_nk.Aembarke'd ‘on. the
.stea1n‘ship New Amsterdam at ;New
‘York on August 24th, 1914, bound for
his natal’ lioine-in Germany. At the
entrance to the English Channel the‘
ship was'- overtaken - by a French
ci-iiiserand, with others, Dr. Zink was
made a‘pri’soner of warand taken. to
a‘ .fortress,_ or military prison, in
France. After some delay,. the
French Government making investi-
gations? "Dr. Zink and five other Ger-
man—Am'erican doctors who also»were"
in prison with him, were released and
permit-tedAto go.Atheir way._- On'.Sep-
ternber 14th, 1914, he-arrived at Kai-_
"s‘eArs,lautern,_ where the’ military au-
thorities. of Germany took charge ‘_of
him" and, transferred him to Wurzburg
.}onTtA‘li_e.Main._ There. he was stationed
:in ‘ at "Lazerett garrison asﬂa _ military
surgeon ‘and as a1_1' officer" in the Ba-

‘when he was transferred. to‘ North-

léngaged as a ﬁeld surgeon. As su'c'h,
he was kept very busy and‘_frequently‘
was called to dangerous places to at-

l During‘ several cif the battles
ffoiu-ght_in October, 1915, he distin-
guished himself by risking his life in
lbehalf of ‘ his fellowA.me11.' and, as’ a
‘token of "reward therefor,» was hon!
'_ored and _decorated _ with the Iron
.,Cross. His services on the battleﬁeld
frequently exposed him to ﬁmany
[changes of temperature and as a- re-
lsult. he gradually biecanie afﬂicted
{with rheumatism and similar? ailments.
lAfter having served on the battlefield
for about one year he ‘was, during

some‘ of his'new readings -to the ‘stu-

this year in Matth_ew Marcus, D_ent.

reader ,inAtheir. out-of-town concerts,
aAnd who h'as won great recognition
as a reader of the clubs. —- ,
