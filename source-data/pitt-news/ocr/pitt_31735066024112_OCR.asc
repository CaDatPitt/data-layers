Covert Involvement in U.S. Events

By DIANE R. POWELL
Pitt News Staff Writer ‘

-Dick Gregory, political and black
human rights activist, opened this
year’s 11th annual Black Week
Monday with a_ three-hour lecture in
which he accused the CIA and FBI "

"3 of covert involvement in important

and recent national events.
Gregory said American citizens
are ‘being manipulated by the
“cream of the elite” via the CIA,
FBI and the U.S. government. He
cited several events to illustrate his

accusations against them to a large- '

ly integrated crowd of approxi-
mately 800.

He opened by discussing the
presidential elections. He said he
was not surprised by the outcome
because the CIA rigged the election. ,

Major Changes

By FRED BEERS
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s English Writing program
has received a major facelift with
the approval of several changes
scheduled to take effect this winter
term.

While the changes directly affect
only those majors declaring April 1,
1980 and after, they will have a
bearing on ‘all majors, according to
Ed Ochester, director of the writing
program.

Those who started under the old
program for a writing major are

“I don’t think he (Reagan)
won,” Gregory said.

Gregory cited the Encyclopedia
Britannica new_ student college dic-
tionary as having listed Reagan as
the 40th president three weeks prior
to the Nov. 4 election. He also
stated that Reagan was, set up for
this election. He said Bush was the
one they wanted to put.in office so
that the CIA could get in the White
House.

“Bush was CIA then and CIA.

now,” he said. “We should say
Reagain in 80 and Bush in ‘81.”
Gregory said that most people
that voted in the presidential elec-
tion didn’t vote for something but
voted against something. He said
the. people voted ‘for Reagan not
because they liked him but because

they ‘didn’t like Carter. He also

“mentioned that only 53 percent of

eligible voters voted, which is‘”"fhe
lowest in the history of this country.

“Had Reagan died two days
before the election, they would have
stuffed him up and pushed him

_around so Bush could get into of-

fice,” Gregory quipped.

Other issues Gregory discussed
were the Iranian crisis, and
Afghanistan. He said the U.S.
government knewin advance about
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
and the takeover of the American
embassy in Iran. I

new classes,” Ochester said in a re-
cent interview.

The outline of the new regula-
tions include a core literature re-
quirement, a redefinition of prere-
quisites and concentrations, and a
minimum grade requirement.

The requirement for credits, 18 in
English writing, 12 in English
literature; related area of 12 credits
in a College of Arts and Sciences
department other than English, and
senior seminarrequirements-remain
the same.

past we didn’t specify courses in
English lit. We do now. There’s a
very. broad range of courses. . .but
we do require that two courses be
taken in literature prior to 1800 and
two be taken in literature after
1800.

“Prerequisites for the major are .

still about the same. The one major
change is that under the old system,
we specified that a person had to
take a course at 50’s level in writing
before they advance to a 100’s level
course. We didn’t specify which.”

Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s student leaders‘ expressed
the concerns of theirconstituents
yesterday at a luncheon meeting
with the visiting Middle States
Association evaluating team in
Forbes Quadrangle.

The Middle States team, con-
sisting.of 10 educators from various

‘universities in the eastern United

States, conducted the student

' meeting as part of their four-day

“on-site” evaluation of Pitt’s
undergraduate schools and pro-
grams. Pitt has been accredited by
Middle States since 1921 but must
be re—evaluated about once every 10
years. ‘ 
Several of the students at the

I meeting stated that undergraduates

face difficulties in understanding
professors‘ who-speak English as a
second language. Jackie Becker of
the Panhellenic Association said
that the inability to understand

‘foreign professors‘ frustrates
‘students and causes some of them

to drop their classes».
“There are some subjects (ma-
jors) where you can’t avoid.having

a foreign professor sometime,’f.

Becker added. _
Seth Lubove, news editor of The
Pitt News, agreed that professors

who cannot speak understandable,

English pose a problem to under-
graduates.

‘committee.

trate on their subject because of the_
way the professor speaks,” Lubove
said.

Evaluating team chairman John
Toll said that his talks with Pitt of-
ficials this week showed that the
university has started to address
language proficiency problems.
Toll said that prospective teaching
assistants must pass a written exam
and other linguistic tests before they-
are assigned a class. If the results of
a linguistic test are poor, teaching
assistants are required to take a
remedial speech course, Toll said.

Evaluation of teaching was also
discussed by Lou Falo of the stu-
dent government’s academic affairs
Falo said that a
publication containing student
evaluations of teaching would aid
undergraduates in selecting pro-
fessors.
academic affairs committee cannot
require faculty members to be

evaluated by their students, such a a

publication would be incomplete. .
Presently, some professors agree
to be evaluated by students but are
not always willing to submit the
results for publication, Falo added.
Besides Falo, Becker and
Lubove, other students attending
the meeting included Don Parella,
Interfraternity Council; Robbie

The, Resident Student Association;

Lights, Camera, Action: Pitt Video Club Filming Pitt Events

By ANN WALKER

“Lights, camera, action!” Heard
only in Hollywood? Not with the
newly organized Pitt Video Produc-
tion Club it isn’t. The club was
recognized by the Student Govern-
ment ‘ Board Oct. 30, and. was
established to provide students with
the chance to actively participate in
the production of video programs
according to the club.

The club. got its start when Chris
Krysinski, now executive producer
of the organization, performed the
“Arab Hoax” in May 1978.

‘ Krysinski said he and a few friends
impersonated an Arabian sheik and
a_ band of Arabian knights. They
toured the oil fields of Titusville
and this display received national
coverage. Alan Abel of Spencer
Productions in New York contacted
Krysinski and gave him the sugges-
tion for the production club'Krysin-

Other "members of the executive
staff include Chris Rasmussen,

executive secretary; and Gary

“Another major aspect of the
club is that it can benefit the univer-

“Administrators can use the video
programs as documentaries to fur-

qualiﬁcations.” ' '

The club is now receiving a $100
tWinter term partial-recognition
budget and, if fully recognized, will
receive unlimited funding. Bob
Colosimo, the liaison for the club,
said the club is now waiting. for a
formal letter of recognition from

the Student Government Board.

The club, once organized and
working, plans to produce a profes-
sionalized 50 minute video program
that will be sent to Spencer Produc-
tions Inc.,- an affiliate of Home Box

Office in New York, Krysinski said.
If the program meets Spencer Pro-

chance the company will air the

Krysinski said. ‘

Equipment used by the club will
be provided by the Audio-Visual
department of the university,
Rusmussen said. The department
has over 20 recorder inch decks.
The club now utilizes two color

‘video tape cameras, one portable

deck, and one standard office type
deck. They are hoping to get an
editing machine and wireless micro-
phones, according to Rasmussen.

The club has been working since ’

Krysinski added. Homecoming

-Middle states

Leslie Domalik, Academic Affairs
Committee; Cheryl Tomko and
Dave Huffner, College of General
Studies (CGS) Student Cabinet,

and Walter Burke, Student Govern- ‘
/ment Board.

Middle States chairman Toll ask-
ed Burke and Huffner why many
student activities available to day-
time students——SGB consti-
tuents-—are not available to night-
time (CGS) students.

Burke explained that day-time
undergraduate student activity fees

As anexampleof what might hap-
pen, Ochester said that a person
would take a 50’s course in poetry,
thus meetingthe 50’s requirement.
They would then advance to a l00’s
zourse in newswriting.

'1 as “didn’t make sense because
the sort of experience we assumed
in one of the 50’s courses wasn’t
there. This wasn’t good for the class
and wasn’t good for the student.”

What is required now, Ochester
said, is “we have forieach of the
tracks a general requirement that a
person take a 50’s course”in each of
the tracks before the person can ad-
vance to a l00’s course in that
track.”

The major change in the program
is the “redefinition” of areas of
concentration. Poetry courses are
“about the same in structure and
number,” according‘ to Ochester,

were raised to $24 effective this
term while the CGS fee remained-at
$12.

“Because of the difference, we
(SGB) felt it wouldibe unfair for
one group to subsidize activities for
the other,” Burke said.

Huffner added that most CGS
students were “not too worried
about the lack of access to pro-
gramming.” He said a majority of
CGS students have full-time jobs
and cannot participate in many day-
time activities. In addition, CGS

students were generally opposed to
an increase in their activities fee,
Huffner said.

CGS cabinet member Tomko
said night students are concerned
about gaining access to university

offices, such as financial aid and,_

student accounts, at night. She said
that the night-time office hours
have to be negotiated on a term-to-
term basis, resulting in much confu-
sion for students when hours are
changed.

However, Glen Nygreen, a
member of the evaluating team,

while the fiction “track” has been
slimmed down.

“The faculty felt that instead of
having a number of courses at the
l00’s level, we should slim them
down. Have an intro course, and in-
termediate course and a senior
seminar, plus topics courses that
will vary from term to term.”

‘The major change comes in the
non-fiction track, which is split into
two concentrations, newspaper and

. magazine, each with its own re-

quirements. E‘

Ochester said that he thought if
there were any major problems for
students, it will probably be in this
track.

“What we’re advising students to

do is, that if they’ve had and intro

course in the past at the 50’s level,
to proceed in the l00’s level course
in that track they want to work in.

There may be some difficulty in the
way of transition but it ought to

work out,’ according to Ochester.

“If they’ve had the basic l00’s
course in the various tracks, we ad-
vise them to take the second part of
the intermediate course. For ex-
pamle, before we had one basic
newswriting course-Writing the
News. In the future we’ll have two
courses at that intermediate level.”

The idea behind the, new
numbers, according to Ochester, is
to “allow people more time to work
on more different kinds of pro-

- blems, to get more experience in the

basic newsgathering operation than
we had time to before. It makes
sense to us to expand those to a
year’s sequence.”

Under the new regulations, a
minimum grade of “C” or better is
required in a 50’s course before the

said his discussions with personnel
in various university offices indicate
a “sense of goodwill” in trying to
solve the problem of limited night-
time office hours.

While night-time students may
find university office hours in-
convenient, some day-time students
find the computer center hours too
limited, according to Becker of the
Panhellenic Association. , if

“We’d have an excellent com-
puter center if they (the computer
terminal locations) would be open
longer,” Becker said. She com-

mented that 24-hour access to the
computers would be welcome by
students.

Resident Student

team that many students are
dissatisfied with the residence hall
policy that went into effect last
spring.

student may advance to a l00’s

' course in that track. Also, a student

who does not earn at least a “C” in
the first l00’s course of a.particular
track, may not advance in that
track. _

Ochester sais he didn’t know
what” would’ happen with the
minimum grade requirement but
that his feelings were that “there
maybe a few people who are going
to be urged out of the program. It
shouldn’t affect a lot of "students
because in practice, by the time peo-
ple get to declaring a major, they’ve
got the kinks worked out. They’re
motivated to work in the major.”

Judith ‘Vollmer, an instructor in
the writing program and a former
writer for the Post-Gazette, said the
changes were a “fine addition to the

curriculum. Peopletwill have a bet— a

ter chance _to actually publish and
develop pieces that are going to be

of some worth in the way of
building up a portfolio.”

She added that the_ curriculum is"

much more organized now and peo-
ple will have a better idea of “what
it's really like on the job instead of
just having a vague idea of what
non-fiction writing is.”

The reasons for the changes, ac— 

cording to Ochester, are that the
“curriculum has grown to a point
where it didn’t seem to make much

teaching sense for either the student _ s

or the faculty as it ought to.

“We wanted to rationalize the
list, we wanted to get courses whose
titles explained what would happen
in the course as well as the sequence
that made sense. We feel that this is
one of the major strengths of the
new program. It looks to us that
it’ll be much clearer
Ochester added.

this country says “they were caught
by surprise.” ‘

He said the United States knew
prior to the takeover of the embassy
that any attempt to bring the Shah
into America would jeopardize the
Americans in Iran. He said a memo
from the Iranian government to the
U.S. state department in August of
1979 notified the United States of
the consequences that would occur
if the Shah was admitted into this
country.

Gregory suggested that the U.S.
government wanted to promote an
incident because they feared the
Ayatollah Khomeini was ready to
withdraw the $8 billion of Iranian
money from U.S. banks. He said
the United States can get the
hostages out anytime they want to,
but they won't want to because the
United States is gaining interest on
the Iranian money. He said, to
date, the United States has gained
$360 million interest on the Iranian

A money.

“The,U.S. is using the money
while the hostages go through
changes, and they know when the
hostages come back they have to
give the money back,” he said.

Gregory also said the hostage at-

the rescue attempt was to leave a
notebook with 600 Iranian air force
troops who were supposed to help
the U.S. troops when they got
there.

“The only reason for the hostage
rescue attempt was to leave the
notebook knowing that the‘-Iranians
would think it was a coup and they
would put the whole army on trial
and “blow their brains” out. The

reason behind this was so that Iraq .

could then attack Iran.

He said we should demand an in-
vestigation into the rescue attempt
because “American equipment
doesn’t break down.”

Gregory also touched on the re-
cent Ku Klux Klan activities. He
said the Klan is coming out against
whites. He cited the incident in

S The Flight of  

The Professors

The plight of teachers of higher education is one
that should be a matter of concern to all ‘college

‘D

the plight of America’s professors in order to im-
prove the situation.

f‘In the decadeof the seventies, while other profes-
sional groups maintained or improved their real
economic incomes, the real incomes of faculty
members of universities and colleges have declined 18
percent,” Richard Thorn, president of the Pittsburgh

~ chapter of the American Association of University

Professors (AAUP) said at a press conference held at
Pitt last Friday.

Academicians are essential to the development and
growth of the minds which will shape this country’s
future. ' ~ .

But with such an important responsibility accorded
to them, why will professors, if current trends con-
tinue,“ join the ranks of the “working poor?”

Thorn cited two sources that contributed to the
decline of the faculty position: inflation and
dependence on the state legislature for money.

Inflation is a national plague that can never be ful- .

ly eliminated. , ‘
’ However, the apathy of the state legislature can.

Meanwhile, professors were left to “moonlight”
or subsist on inadequate salaries. h

At a time when the nation’s economic situation is
becoming increasingly tighter, students stand to lose
the most from the legislature’s indifference, if Thorn
has correctly pinpointed the source of the professor’s
difficulties. Because of the low financial incentive of
a university faculty position, prospective teachers
may be discouraged from attempting to achieve
academic status. Or, highly talented and qualified
professors could be forced to abandon their positions
because of economic difficulties.

University officials can utilize their ‘clout in at-

tempting to persuade legislators to increase university
appropriations. ‘

, Also, college students should realize they have an
obligation to improve the lot of their professors by
pressuring the legislature.

Although Pitt students know all too well the dif-
ficulties encountered when pushing for increased

'2. Your grades are terrible.

anyway. No one can study when
it's sunny outside...or
or rain-
, ing. . .‘ Studying is just plain old
hard to do when there are so many
other things to do. If you had a real
job, you wouldn’t have to worry
about all the stuff you could be do-
ing if you didn’t have to do what
’‘ you were doing, because you’d have
I to do what you were doing or you’d
starve. . .1 think. What’s the point
of continuing with a 2.0 QPA?
That’s not going to get you a better
job. Now, if it was a 2.0 from_’Har-
vard, perhaps there’d be a point in
staying. You're at Pitt, though. ] .

' 3. There are a lot of ugly people
on campus‘ who like you. Have you
noticed that? Nearly everyone who
says “Hello” to you is‘ sort of
overweight and has complexion
problems. They don’t shower often
and flies follow them. How did you

‘ make these friends? Where did you_

meet them? Why are their grades so
much higher? How come they have
rich parénts? Why put up with

. them? You can leave. --

‘4. Buses never come when you’re
waiting. The Port Authority has a
man with binoculars and a walkie—
talkie stationedon the roof on the
Student Union; When he sees you

V waiting, he tells all the ~buses going

your way to wait. What can you do
when you’re waiting for the bus?
Stop picking yournose. Can you

‘ read? Lower your head for a mo- ’

ment and your bus will roar by at
fifty miles an hour.

5. You don’t ever have a number
2 pencil, so you’re obviously not
going to be able to pass any of your
courses. Face it, you’re just not
compatible with computers. Did
you think a human being was going
to grade your testsand make up
your schedule? Better quit now, it
can only get worse.

6. If you leave school now, you

can always come back. *Of course,

yourself. Do you really think you’ll

7. If you stay, you'll just wind

Modified To Avoid Problems

By VALERIE JACHIMOWICZ
Pin News Staff Writer

The Student Government Board
election code was modified this year
to clarify areas that caused pro-
blems last year, according to Stu-
dent Government Election Commit-
tee (SGEC) Co-chairperson Larry
Schwartz.

The code was changed this year
so that no organization can endorse
a candidate and offer money to
members to encourage them to
vote, Schwartz said, referring to
Article V, section 5B of the Election
Code.

This clause reads “No individual
or organization that endorses any
candidate may offer any material
prize for voting.”

Last year, Schwartz said, the
SGEC had difficulties when several
schools endorsed a candidate and
offered money to the departments
with the highest voter turn-out.
This caused several candidates to
complain, and the code was chang-
ed this year to be more specific
about endorsements, Schwartz said.

The new elections code also increas-
ed the amount of money candidates
are allowed to spend on their cam-
paigns by $10.00. A candidate run-
ning alone can spend up to $60.00.
Candidates running as a party have
to spend less apiece, but can com-
bine their funds.

Student organizations that en-
dorse a candidate are not allowed to
contribute more than $5.00 for that
candidate. Candidates running as a
party can not be given more than
$5.00 as a party. University-

SGB equipment and facilities,
such as the Gestetner printing press,
may not be used by candidates “to
reproduce or print material for a
candidate’s campaign.” The elec-
tion code also states that the student
government offices are also not ac-
cesible to any organizations that en-
dorse a candidate.

The election code is specific

about campaign materials. Stickers
and self-adhesive materials may not
be used, but candidates may utilize
posters, banners, and leaflets. They
must be hung or distributed in ac-
cordance with university regula-
tions, and candidates are responsi-
ble for seeing that campaign
material is removed after the elec-
tions.

By MIKE DICHIARA
Pitt News Sports Editor
The major topic of discussion at

myesterda’y’s. football press luncheon
‘was , the quarterback situation at

Pitt. Panther offensive coach Wal-
ly English had a lot to say on the
subject. ~— ’ '

“I think there was consideration
that he (Dan Marino) would not
play anymore this year,” said

»English, “because of the injury.

But now, Danny can practice and
move around like a regular player.”
The fact that Marino is able to
practice has not changed the present
situation of Trocano starting as
quarterback. .
“Ricky is the starter and Danny is
said

English. “The difference between

, them is that Danny is more of a pro-

type, drop back, pocket-type
passer. Hé’s the kind of guy you
build a team around. _

“We don’t want him (Marino) to
sprint out or option in order to pro-
tect him from getting injured,” he
added.
pend on the line or Randy
McMillan. It depends.on ability of
our quarterback and what he can do
physically. ’ ’~

According to English, the Pan-

‘ther offense has an advantage when ’
P Trocano is the quarterback because

of his ability to run with the foot-
ball.

“”l"he.,(opposing) defense knows
it can’t drop off because Ricky will
‘runfor 10 or 15 yards,” English
said. “The ability of Trocano to
run with-the ball is an advantage.
We try to protect Danny; Trocano
can protect himself.”

English explained by saing that

if , Marino is not the type of quarter-

back who will run with the football.
Marino is thus being protected by
the offensive line. He is less apt to

being hurt while staying in the

pocket than by running the foot-

ball: He sustained the knee injury I

when he ran to congratualate

. Dwight Collins on a touchdown:
, reception.

/ Trocano, according to English,
protects himself because he is a run-
ning quarter back. He knkows how

to run with the football and stay '

away from being hit hard by the
defenders. -

Panther cornerback Terry white (no. 23) returns one of his two interceptions against Louisville
this past Saturday. This week’s test for the nation's number two defense will be the passing
attack of the Cadets from Army.‘ 1 7 ‘ ’

“Dan Marino would never run '

with the ball and the defense knows
it,” said English. “Trocano,

however, becomes the third back.” ‘

The Pitt coach, however,'didn’t
go so far as to say that Pitt is a bet-
ter~'team with Trocano atthe helm.

“Both are prepared to run the
whole offense,” he said. “We have
a bussel bag of offensive plays and
we -select the plays appropriatevto

. the quarterback.’ ’

“We practice option and sprin-
tout plays with Marino but just
don’t execute as much,"’, English
added. “We practice drop-back
plays with Trocano but just don’t
execute as much.

“I like to see the ball in the air.
We do ‘a lot in our passing attack

with Danny and do less _with the

running attack. But we can win
with both,” said English.

' . English also believes that having

two different type quarterbacks is
an ‘advantage to the Panthers. Ac-
cording to him, when Pitt plays
Penn State after Thanksgiving, the
Lions’ coach Joe Paterno will be at
a disadvantage because he won’t be

able to prepare his defense for just

one quarterback. Q  .
“Right now, Danny won’t start
at Penn State,” said English. “But
he might be in there on the second

play of the game.” .

Spikers Place In Western ‘

Michigan Tourney    

By SCOT STONE
Pitt News Sports Writer
The Pantherette volleyball team
finished second at the Western

Michigan Invitational over the.

weekend. The Pitt team made it to
the final round where they lostto a
strong Tennessee squad. 1
“I was very happy with the way
our team played,” said Pantherette
coach Shelton Collier. “Tennessee
was ”a good team, but they won

mostly because we didn’t get any I

breaks.” .
Tennessee is rated number one in

v the Southern division, and may,

possibly meet Pittsburgh again ‘at
this year’s national competition.
, In" round robin play, Pitt beat
Wisconsin and Kellogg Community
College, and suffered one loss to
Tennessee. The victory over
Kellogg came as a happy surprise to
Collier. 7

“We were real happy about that

win,” Collier said. “At that point
we were losing.‘ We had just been
beat by Tennessee, and it looked as
though we might not make it past
this team, but then everyone really
seemed to start believing in them-
selves, that they could win, that the
team could do‘ it. We scored ten
points in a row, and that put us on
an upward surge.”

Kellogg was last year’s Junior
College division champions, but
their final score against Pitt was:
15-11, 15-11, 8-15, 8-15, 16-14.

On the rebound from their win
over Kellogg, Pitt beat Cincinnati in
thequarter-final round, three games
straight. _

“They were a respectable team,”
Collier said, “but we had it over
them in skills and ability.”

Pitt went on to, win the semi-.
ﬁnals against Western Michigan,
the team they had lost to earlier this
year at the Pitt Invitational tourna-

ment. It was a close match, going ‘

for four games. The final score was
18-16, 15-10, 11-15, 15-7.

According to Collier, his team’s
level of play has improved steadily
over the past few weeks.

“We’ve developed in terms of
our defense and our spiking
ability,” Collier said. “Our serving
wasn’t what it could’ve been, and I
think that might explain our loss to
Tennessee.”

Several players that contributed

— to Pitt’s effort were sophomore

Robin Kukalis who, until recently,
was . a substitute; Paula Olsen,
whom Collier considers perhaps the

«most consistent and valuable

volleyball player in the East; and
Julie Gaul, the team’s setter.

After this weekend, the Panther-
ettes will have some time to work on
their plays, and tune up for the

regionals which will be coming up ‘

throw the ball and they are ‘a well-
disciplined team. The offensive line
is a veteran one and will have to rely
on that experience when they match‘
up against the Panther defense.
The Panthers are only one-tenth
of a yard behind Florida State in
totaldefense giving up only 203.4
yards per game. The unit is still
number one against the rush with
only 61.7 yards per game. _
“They’re the best defense in the
country,” said Army head coach
Ed Cavanaugh via a telephone

hookup from New York. “I don’t

know who’s better: the ends,
linebackers or the secondary."
They’re probably better than the
Steelers.” ’ '9 P

Booters Learned ci Great Deal This Season  

By AININA ARLOTTA

The Pitt soccer team went
through a very disheartening ex-
perience in the fall of 1980. A
tough situation arose, yes, but, a
most important lesson’ was learned
for_ the future of the Panther
booters. Being a young team com-
posed mostly of freshman and
sophomores, the Panthers went
through the biggest learning ex-
perience of their collegiate careers.

Where exactly did the problem lie
with the Panthers this fall? The
first month of the season treated the
Panthers rather well. By the first
week in ‘October Pitt was sporting a
7-2 record and looking to post
season » playoff competition,
thought that has not been in any
Panther booters mind for many a
year. But after a nine day layoff the
Panthers returned to play a very
conditioned, winning Bethany
team, who just happened to have
playoffs on their minds too.

The Panthers success story came
to a screeching halt. Beginning on

Oct. -15 with a 3-1 defeat to

Bethany, Pitt lost the final six
games of their otherwise successful
season. The overall record dropped
from a respectable 7-2 to a mind-
boggling 7-8. A number of things
have been pointed to since the dust
has cleared away and the season has
ended a week ago. Varied and
many, these problems will be work-
ed on when the Panthers open up
their winter indoor season in
January.

“We I certainly need a good
recruiting year,” said sophomore
Eric Tiedtke. “We need more
speed up front and we need our
halfbacks to be a genuine scoring

threat. This season Al (Adelmann) -

had three goals but they were all on

penalty kicks, Danny (Hamm) and ‘

Chris (Richmond) each had one.
We have to establish ourselves as a
scoring threat all over the field.
Maybe that will mean a little bit of
change in positions, like moving
Chris to the wing or me to the left
wing.”

Richmond, a freshman from New
York believes that confidence had
to be built by thosé*"fir‘st year men:
and after the layoff and a couple of
losses that confidence took a
serious blow. I

“With me personally I don’t
think that I played as well as I could
of, partly because I had an ankle in-
jury all season and I had never
played hurt before,-” said Rich-

was coming to college ball and
building confidence. When I first i
came to Pitt, 1, along with everyone
else, had a lot of adjusting to do,
and with us winning so much early
in the year our conﬁdence was
really built up. Then when we
slacked off with the losses it really

hurt.”

Confidence and the overall at-
titude of the team was looked at by
freshman Gerry Wasson as being an
important factor in the Panthers
season.

“There seemed to be a changed

- attitude during that layoff prior to

the Bethany game,” said Wasson.

“That change deﬁnitely effected
play for the remainder of the
season. Bethany ruined the
momentum that we had built up the
entire firstyhalf of the year. I think
that we got back that momentum
when we played Penn State a week
later, but it just wasn’t the same

‘after we had two losses going into

the game.”

Out of the six games that the
Panthers lost in the second half of
the season, four were to teams that
have since made it to post season
playoffs. Bethany, Penn State,
WVU, and Indiana have all receiv-
ed bids for further competition. All
but Indiana were ranked in the top
twenty in the country. '

According to a sophomore
fullback, it is this competition com-

bined with little support from the

athletic department that has put the
Panthers soccer program into such
a position.

“We have this problem with Pitt
soccer,” said Trempus. “We face

,.some very tough competition,

which we want to come up against.
‘We play a lot of nationally ranked
teams along with a lot of area col-
leges who are in the WPISC. We
always end upbeing stuck in the
middle at the epd of the year. On ‘
one hand we don’t play enough area
competition to be ranked highly in
the WPISC and we don’t have the
level of play, yet, to compete
against all those national
powerhouses. It seems to me that if
the athletic department wants us to
be nationally ranked like our op-
ponents and if they want us’ to bring
recognition to the school, then they
are going to have to help us start
something.’ ’

The Panthers were doing well in
the WPISC before the layoff in
mid-season. Tiedtke, with seven
goals and three assists, was second
in the league in scoring. He was

and Troy Norton who rounded out
the top ten. Goalkeeper Scott
Thunberg had four shutouts to his
credit and was within two of break-
ing the season record of six. The
Panthers had won five games in a
row and were ‘undefeated on their
home turf. Then it happened.
“The ball just wasn’t distributed
all the time,” said Richmond.»
“Eric and Al needed to have some
of the pressure taken off of them.
It could be this distribution that
took us down the losing trail.”
Pitt will graduate three from the
1980 season, fullback Tomi Kunkel,
midfielder Hamm and backup
goalie John Bonessi. With the loss

be looking to fill some vacancies.
Optimism runs high though among
the youthful squad that will return.

“We know each other a lot better
and we'll be closer as players,” said
Wasson. “We are only losing two
starters, so that should be a good
factor. Our ‘offense, which has
b_ee;;..,a problem in the past, will be
intact next season. And those new

been a problem’ in the past, will be
intact next season. And those new
faces that we will see in the defense
will be able to combine with the ex-
perience ‘of Jim (Hackworth), Don
(Bowen), and Tom (Trempus), to
make up for the inexperience of the
newcomers. All it will take will be
for everyone to keep the optimistic
attitude that we have towards ‘next
season, if we keep that through the
winter indoor season and on until
next fall then I’m sure that we’ll
have a top quality team. We have
the skills we have to keep the at-
titude.” ,,

“We’ll be a year older and have
this year of playing experience

mond. “But what was important followed by teammates Bob Hughes of these three coach Leo Bemis will factor. Our offense. Which has Uhdéf 115.” Said Richmond.

PCIV Helps Pittsburgh Visitors

By TIM McCABE
Here in__Pittsburgh, the impres-
sions of the city and even the coun-
try which are formed by foreign
students and visitors are largely due
to the programs created and im-

- plemented by the Pittsburgh Coun-

Cil for International Visitors

(PCIV). -

“Our government felt that the
United States was probably the
most misunderstood country in the
world,” according to Alvira
Capone, director of PCIV, which is
located in Mervis Hall.

~ “They felt if people had an op-
portunity to come and see America,
then they would get a different im-
pression," she said.

Students accepted at Pitt or most
western Pennsylvania colleges are
contacted by PCIV and offered a
“home-stay” in which they can
reside with an American volunteer
family for a few days before school
begins.

“We have had scholars come
back and say that without their first
stay and the learning, they couldn't
have gotten along,” Capone said.
“I remember the funniest one of all
saying, ‘I could have coped with
everything, except the American
sense of humor.”’

Many of the students don’t reply:
“They’re very leery of being indoc-
trinated. Overseas, they’re not
familiar with volunteerism like we
have in America. They want to
know why they are being invited to
dinner,” Capone said.

‘ “There’s an extension of the
home-stay program in which the
student visits the same family mon-
thly or on potentially lonely
holidays. I hosted two visitors of
One young
man, who was fond of American
girls, had the atiitude of ‘Don’t call
me; I’ll call you,’

“He’d come over to introduce a
new girl; otherwise we’d never see
him. The other young man called
everyday. If he didn’t call, I was
supposed to call him or else he

I would be very hurt.

“Many of the foreign wives are
rather lost here because it’s the first
time they have been away from

their extended families and they
never really cared for their children
by themselves,” Capone explained.
In response, PCIV has implemented
a once-a-week “coffee’,’ where the
wives gather with other wives of
their homeland and American wives
to learn simple English for five
dollars a term from Pitt’s English
Language Institute. I '

In addition, the federal govern-
ment sponsors visits by leaders who
relate their impressions of America
to their countrymen, Capone said.

Anwar Sadat was one of the
potential leaders that came to
America in 1966 as a guest of the

government, although he didn’t
visit Pittsburgh.
“He was very anti-

American. . .very pro-Soviet,”
Capone said. “He wasn’t sure he
wanted any of his group to accept a
U.S. grant, so his people suggested

that he should go. He came, spent

about 30 days, and went back.

“Our government credits the
changes he has made in his country
to the visit. He has tossed the
Soviets out, been much more of a
friend to the United States than
anyone else in the Middle East, and
he has done his best to give us can-
cessions over Israel.”

Sadat .and other international
citizens like him are invited by the
U.S. embassies to Washington,
D.C. From there, the National
Council for International Visitors
or similar non-profit councils plot a
course across a network of 92 cities
with organizations like PCIV.

Their course will be plotted ac-
cording to their academic,
economic, political and social in-
terests. Pittsburgh is usually the
first stop out of Washington
because of its large corporations.

Pi“5bUY8h’s most recent guest
was the director for the'Christian
Democratic Party of West Ger-
many, Mr. Ulf Fink.

The reason PCIV can serve non-
academics like Fink is because it is
not a department of the uniiféfsily.
Pitt grants PCIV office space in
