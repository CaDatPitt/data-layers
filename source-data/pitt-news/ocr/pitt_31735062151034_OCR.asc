_ Once more the warriors from: Little Washington were forced
 to fall -before theonslaughts of the varsity. For the ird suc-
cessive time our football team, weakened by the fgraduation of

1 such .styars?,Aas Peck, Herron, Thornhill, Soppitt and St-ahlman
and, almost destroyed by the enlistment of Hastings, D‘eHart,‘
v Hilty, "Morrow and-Meadows, rallied to the colors of the Gold
and Blue‘ and fo_rcedW. & J. Ato ibow their he‘a.ds.in defeat. We
have but the highest praise for our ancient rivals. _They played

AA "a clean, Ihard game. They fought with every‘ o,u.n"c-e of strength in
 their possession, They met a superior team and were -defeated,
« and they took their defeat as W. "& . men have always taken de-
ifeat; with a"sm‘ile and a handshake. They are men——all of them.

ness—somethiiig he hammeredia-t lung
before the" war started. He did good
work in. boosting the second Liberty

various New York theaters. He men-
tioned his former classmates at the
old University, Ethelbert Nevin,‘ -the
famous composer, now deceased, and
Vance Thompson, the brilliant author.
(Do,a1l present_ day Pitt “grads” know
that these men are alumni of our Uni-

p The Penn -game, which was at-
tended by a number of the New York
Club merrilbers, came in for a lot ,,of
discussion. Mr. Kerr, “old grad”. of
theiclass of 1867, who was there, in
reply, to Mr. MncIntosh’s questions,
‘stated that he had given up all eve-
ning dinners and banquets except
those of the University of Pittsburgh.’

A A Final Word

The Secretary has this ﬁnalword
to the *'al‘urnni regarding the plan: It
strikesliim as one of the best to help
the .University in her ﬁnancial prob-
lems that could possibly be devised.
I The spirit of Pitt has been growing
wonderfully in recent years. Every-
one. wants to. do a little to help Pitt,
just as he contributes to his ch'111‘Chi_
fraternity. or any other V connection.
Now is the chance to do it. '

It may be argued that this is the
vxrong time to enter into sugh a move-

That._ phase of the matter’ was dis-

the Board of Trustees and it was felt
that NOW’ IS THE TIME  "ACT.
The University must go 0n,_gvar 01‘ 110
war. The University isentitlied to the
support of the alumni, just as any
other publicmovement is worthy of
support. -,  I
__‘The following letter, signed by
George H. Clapp, ?77, Chairman of
the Board of Trustees, and Dr. J. A.
Koch.‘ ’84, President’ of the General

All money eceived therefrom will be
set aside exclusively for permanent en-
dowment and buildings.

,._~,_»;and’ Black-successfully ‘passed, the
;j;'§.~P_itt men now tiurn their eyes toward
"~.'7»’the contest with Tech, which is the
‘next number on the -program. Both
Warner .and his men ‘realize that the
game with the proteges of Walter
+gS_teﬁen will be no walkaway and a
great deal of attention _will be paid
"‘*‘-to,making ready for the tilt.
..T'he Plaid stock has been steadily
_ _o_ndthe rise since the ﬁrst ofthe year.
'Th‘e‘_victories they 'have to thel.' credit
-_and the showing made against Army

-_pé.t,uIs to the igterest in the "approach-_
" ting. tilt. Then the local sport oracles
L>.h‘ave "taken this record and added to
;‘_it"th.e‘ fact that the wearers of the
A L-ggray always ﬁght unusually hard
,_‘ against the Pitt men, and have ar-
':‘-‘,-irivedaat -the conclusion that this game
giwill be one of the tests of the year
for the Blue‘ and Gold. Tech will
-, strike the Pitt -team just after ‘the
- grueling game‘wi-th & J. at a
/time when the eﬁiciency of the ma-
chine will be -at an ebb in'the hurry
 of_'the -preparation-forsthe Thanksgiv-
_. ing day game with State, and theone

3: ful Soldier eleven. In addition to all
.-gofher advantages, Tech will have had
» a week's rest and thorough knowledge
offthe Pitt offensive gained through
 the watching of Saturday's game.
_ Tech Out for Blood
That .the—Plaid will be out for blood
w is an unquestioned fact. Last year
they scored for the',ﬁr'st' time against
the_‘B_lue and Gold, and will be in
sef_arch~of a piece of the same pottage
«.<§this’~seaso’n. It_ is assured, however,

One of these was fumbled and inthe
resultant -nﬁxup the Red and ‘Black
secured the ball. Failing in an,’ at-
tempt to «push across for a touchdown
the Red and Black en1eaden'ed'the
hopes of the Pittites by kicking at goal
from the ﬁeld. _ I

Pitt again received the kickolfand

this time there was unhooked a.keen
bit of football strategy. Miller took
the kick almost on the goal line and
started up the right side of theﬁeld.
On the twenty-yard line, when the
'opposition had been drawn over
toward the side of the massed inter-
ference, Miller double passed ‘to East-
erday, who raced "down the'ﬁe_ld and
made the return a full sixty yards. A
few plays suﬂiced to carry the ball to
the Red and Black 24-yard line, from
whence Miller went across for a
touchdown on.a -fake kick from‘ the
placement. ' -' A

The second Pitt score came when,
after a series _of.hard plays McLaren
carried the ball across for the last Pitt
sccre. , Once more during the day the
Blue and Gold came within easy scor-
ing distance of the Wash-Jcﬁ line. It
was after a series of drives, equaled
only’-by the one against Penn, that ‘it
was Pitt's ball on the W. & J. one-
yard line. It was last down and the
"line to make, but the drive to the goal

and Gold and they ,were unable to
take i-t across, whereat McCreight
kicked out of danger. .

W. & J. scored their only tbuch-
down when McCreight ran -back a
punt ﬁfty yards, followed it by'two
successful passes and ﬁnally Stobbs
snaked‘ across. for a touchdown. W.
& J. made two other unsuccessful
trials at the goal from the ﬁeld, but
each of them failed. The score:

Oh, boy, what’ a game!

Pitt gained 280 yards from scrim-
mage, while W. & J. got but 56.
Question:
of 56 yards gained, to what score
would a gain of five times that much
entitle you?

History reversed itself this time.

ANNOUNCED

Two important discoveries which
will aid matiarially in ‘cutting the high
cost’ of. living have been announced
-by «the Mellon Institute of Research
of the University of Pittsburgh.

One is the perfection of a‘ new
method of milling ﬂour that increases
the value of" wheat approximately 5
per’ cent. The demand in this coun-
try is, for white flour,’ and in milling
about -70 ‘per centfof‘ the wheat pro-’

into -second grade flour and the re-
maining 20 per cent. is animal‘ food.
Experiments made for a large milling
company have added 5 per cent. more
white ﬂour. A new process of bread
making worked out at the Institute
has been adopted by the French and
English governments and the Belgian
Relief Commission. A
Another discovery of importance is
a. method to preserve. orange ‘anti
grapefruit juice“ *Citrus—fruit growers '
‘have ‘been compelled to waste large
portions of their‘ ‘crops through
‘fculls." For years eﬁorts to preserve
orange juice have been made.
