Group Finds Students
Resist Signing Protest

. By JIM O'BRIEN
The ad hoc Student Committee on Discrimination inad-

vertently learned While they were petitioning this week that
they are right —- there is bias here. '

Many students rebelled to affixing their names to the I

petition like so many prima donnas being sought for auto-

graphs. Some of their reason

assured the committee mem-  W

bers that they are pursuing a‘

Worthy cause. _

‘There were plenty of table-side
discussions —- some heated -— and
often outright heckling at the
four petition booths which were
set up on the ground floor of the
CL, the SU lounge, in Engineer-
ing Hall, and in Scaife Hall.

- Want Strong Stand

VThe immediate objective of the
committee, according to chairman
Irv Garﬁnkle, is to petition the
administration to take. a stronger
stand against discrimination on
campus.

Garﬁnkle says the committee
plans to take the results of
their petition to the Chancellor_
for his attention.

“Being a moral force — this is
what University is —- they should
be the ﬁrst to mouth non-dis-
crimination,” Garfinkle said. “But
they don’t come out against this as
a University.”

Apparently they won't either,
judging by Chancellor Litchﬁeld’s
‘remarks at his monthly luncheon
with student representatives on
‘Monday.

He said he recognizes the
moral responsibility of the Uni-
versity in this area, but he/does
not feel he should have to make
statement after statement re-
garding his policy'on the sub-
ject. .

“I’m glad the students are in-
terested,” he said, “and [AI am will-
ing to talk to the students about
this.” He later said, however, that

ing on here.”

he would prefer they take this up

with Alan C. Rankin, the dean of
Student and General Affairs.

“I don’t know if anything. can
be done,” Garﬁnkle remarked. “I
sort of wonder about it". I hope
the Chancellor will do something.
But I don’t know if he will. It’s
hard to be optimistic after‘ hear-
ing What he said.” '

\Vhat the Chancellor
should" not disillusion the com-
mittee after.‘ some of the gems
they heard at the different peti-
tion booths from outspoken stu-
dents.

“What good is it?” was a stand-- ‘I

ard reply, according to Gary Bar-

kov, a sophomore English -litera- .

ture major who manned the
booth in the Engineering Hall.

“I expected that a lot of people 

are bigotted here, and now I am
sure,” Barkov said after‘ a frus-
trating afternoon. “My opinion
that engineers are clods has also
been -conﬁrmed.”

Barkow said students made
what he termed “guerilla at-
tacks” on his booth, i.e., they
would scream and then jump on;
a nearby elevator. A

“I now know also that I am a

nigger lover,” Barlow exclaimed.‘

”And because I am a Jew, I am
now on a par with Marx.” ,
Ron Mann, a Junior English lit-
erature major who petitioned in
the SU lobby, said, *‘It’s great see-

ing people express their ignor- -'

ance.”

Effects of Cigarette Smoking

Shown in Lung

Cancer Exhibit

The Allegheny Chapter of the American Cancer Associa-
tion —is sponsoring an exhibit concerning the effects of ciga-
rette smoking on lung cancer in the SU»Lounge.

The attracting feature of the exhibit, according to The
American Cancer Society and Dr: Douglas’ Thompson of the
University Health Service, _is a wheelbarrow containing

The wheelbarrow is accompanied
by a kin-g sizedcigarette, puffing
smoke and mounted on a pedistal.

Various relating smoking and
health hazards augment the -'ex-
hibit. Volunteers from The Alle-
gheny Cbunty Cancer Society
branch will man the exhibit,
which closes tomorrow. These

volunteers will distribute the
pamphlet, “Shall I Smoke,” and

Rothkrug Fires at ‘Straw’lMan    
At ‘Last Lecture’ On Monday  

By THOMAS PLATE
Dr. Lionel C. Rothkrug de-

cried society’s “excessive de- Z
pendence on external objects” ‘

at the SU “Last Lecture” held
in the lower lounge on Mon-
day.

The assistant professor of. his-

tory asked if life must only be 

a “tale told by an idiot, full of
sound and fury, signifying noth-
ing.” He implied that life might
be this if the “straw” man roams
the world.

Dr. Rothburg asserted the rise
of the “straw” man is due in part
to our industrial-military‘ society.
“The growing up of vast industrial
complexes,” he said, “has ration-
alized human existence.” Noting
that one can speak of other people
as alienated from human qualities,
he said thatna military value is

Rothkrug indicated this rise as a

crave for more and more material
goods. Emotionally attached to
these goods, people panic in the
face of a threat to their system of

Residence Counselors

,_ Jerry Whalen, director of men’s ‘housing, announcedi
that applications for residence counselors in the new dorms

positions are available. The

ﬁrst is that of house counselor, ‘who will be in charge of one
house consisting of three ﬂoors. The second position is that

of floor counselor, who will con-0

centrate on a speciﬁc ﬂoor within
5 house.

.The new system will bring
down the present counselor to
student ratio from one to 65 to
one counselor for every. 38 stu-
year. This ratio is

the counselor will have
fewer people to work with, and
therefore, he will be ‘able to do
a better job.
> Seeks Mature Men

‘Whalen said‘ that the house
counselor should be at least a
in undergraduate school
but no limit has been set as to
the age of ﬂoor counselors. They

‘need only be mature enough to

handle their job. Graduate stu-
dents will also be considered for
the positions.

A Interested men may pick up

“ their applications in the Dean
of Men's oﬁice, 801 CL. Each
applicant will have an interview
with a member of the dean's
staff.

Each applicant should be ma-
ture, competent , and have an in-
terest in counseling work. Whalen
stated, he would prefer that the

‘applications had some previous

experience either in counse‘ing or
working with peaple.
Fees Paid
House counselors will have their
non-academic invoice fees paid.
Floor counselors will receive
slightly less for, their services.
Whalen added. “I think
this. capacity offers an excel-
lent opportunity to ‘anybody in
college because it is an ex-
cellent chance for people to live
with and help other people.”
Men interested only in the
monitary aspects of 0 unseling
will be discouraged, Whalen
warned. A good counselor can
never be paid in accordance with
the amount or the quality of his
work.

Arts student who. transferred

tion she received -at Scaife Hall.

“They were really afraid to
sign,” she said. “They feared the
recriminations. They thought they
could be deliberately flunked out
of school for signing.”

Guerillas Aplenty

«There was a guerilla on her
beat, too, however. “One guy
came zooming by, and said, ‘get
out of here’,” she said.

Since the committee is not a
University recognized organi-
zation. they had to ﬁnd a spon-
soring organization in order to
set up their booths and even
here they found people unwill-
ing to cooperate.

Thompson feels that by contin-

achieved in helping the non-smok-

» The anti-discrimination committee has bitten off a large
chunk of human corruption to set right, and it is really
.AAvery doubtful if anything of permanent beneﬁt will come
out of the entire campaign. ‘ " _
The written petition being circulated around campus
calls for a stronger administrative stand against holding
[University “functions at any facility in Pittsburgh which
practices discrimination,” and also demands the formation
ofa committee to examine what it calls “subtle discrim-
ination against interracial personal relationships.”

The ﬁrst of the committee’s objectives —- obtaining the
‘co-operation of the administration — has already been
_ squelched by the Chancellorin a few comments he made
 at the student luncheon on Monday.

At that time he remarked that he is tired of having to
,-keep stating and restating the University’s official position
on the matter. That position being that it is up to each in-
' Adividual organization to boycott these facilities which prac-

tice discrimination. ‘ .1

the administration but from the student bo_dy. The students
apparently do not feel that the issue is serious enough_ for

the entire measure onthe grounds that muAch of the “subtle
discrimination” is completely erroneous and has no basis in

Start of Story -Writing . :A:

  . Calculating Art

I ﬁnished my first serious piece of ﬁction not
long ago. It was a short story based to some
extent on the life of my grandfather, and I can’t
say that I truly had fun writing it. Someone else
might have been able to run a story like that,
ﬁfteen pages or so, off in a couple
of hours, but it was a four week
chore for me. I don’t know ‘ex-
actly how good it was. For
those of youvon the inside, suf-
ﬁce it to say that it was worth a
few of Dr. Culver’s little pen-
cilled stars. But the exhilarating
part about "it was that it was
my first. _

Actually, I’ve been writing.
since I was in ninth grade. I did
a couple of pieces _for an _
English class, one on skin-diving and one a dialogue
between two Negro ﬁeld hands in Alabama. May-
be my teacher was a landlubber or a segregat.ion-

ist, or maybe he just knew a lousy piece. of writ-

ing when he saw one. At any rate, ‘I received a
matched set of D’s for my efforts. My first break
came when I "was in tenth grade. The school news-
paper consented to publishing a little essay on ‘in-
secticides I wrote for a more discriminating pro-
fessor, and I was on my way. That piece was a
bug-’s-eye view of the human-insect war, and it
was my ﬁrst attempt at humor. I got a lot of fun
out of writing it,‘ but the only thing of value I
learned was that any subject —— even school spirit
— handled in a fresh way could be made interest-
ing. Maybe that’s all I had to learn at that point,
because I’m a writing major /now, still looking to
make those old subjects interesting. A

Has Gone Far

But I’ve learned a few more things in the‘ﬁveA

years since my grand expose of the insecticide in-
dustry -— most as a result of my own‘ observations

 

By Stan Stein

and limited experiences. For instance, the other
day I was watching another guy write an essay
that he wanted to submit to “Mosaic.” He sat over
a typewriter and tapped out a couple of sentences.
Then he sat back, took a deep breath and let out a
long deep sign, looked out the window and huﬂ’ed
and puffed some more, wiped his forehead with his
hand, then bent over the typewriter again. I thought
he was in labor. For him writing was an emotional
experience.. I watched trauma after trauma and’
thought if he could only type that anguish and
emotion onto the paper, he would have a master-.
piece. But he couldn’t, and his breath, no matter
how’ hot and heavy, coudn’t form the words. I
decided then and“ there that writing is not and
should not be and emotional experience. Every
word must count for something, and the process of
choosing the correct word is a clearly calculating
one. The writer should not become totally involved
in what he is writing, only the way that he is wriAt-
ing it. If a person says that he “just sits down and
lets the words ﬂow,” I don’t see how what he is‘
writing can be understandable to anyone but him-
self,‘ because everythingthat goes on in his mind
cannot be intelligible to anyone else. And if it is
intelligible, then either the writer isn’t putting
down everything, or-he is doing a lot of sub-
limal word-editing. A
The Right Approach

I really didn’t feel too badly that my ﬁrst story‘

This soundsveryj good. But, Mr.

students here at Pitt, why won’t
you take effective action such
as you did about the parking
meter question, instead of just
stating “We will support you

Teller Furor Also

Editor, The Pitt News:

The April 3_ issue of The Pitt

but two of the letters published-
in 1 ,th.a issue ontained. what: -I“

in so high of a‘ position is bound

to be, and granted‘ also that

many tpeople disagree with his
policies concerning nuclear dis-,.
arment, or more correctly, lack»
of it. 2

But the fact remains that Dr. A

Teller is one of the great _ nu-

7‘

clear scientists of our day. I’m V A ,

sure that the University honored‘
him for his scientiﬁc work, and

not for his political views as _'

was stated. in one of,theA letters.

Dr. Teller’s scientiﬁc. accom-

worthy of the degree granted
him by Pitt, and anyone who
feels that Dr. Teller should not

intellectual discrimination, but
also of the same type of black-

Honoree Creates Big Stir

‘ Teller Causes

—<

Repercussions

By NANCY FUCHS

An attempt to provide a stimulating program for Honors
Convocation netted the University in a web of controversy.
The administration’s decision to confer an honorary
science degree on Dr. Edward Teller caused many repercus-
sions. Students and faculty alike boycotted the Convocation.
I The most dissatisfaction occurred in the physics department.

I Dr. Thomas Donahue, p1'ofessor6
of physics, feels that
pministration was acting in “good

“the ad-

faith” when it chose to honor
Teller. “No calculated insult .was

. intended; however, I think it’s in-

credible that they did not realize
there was such strong feeling
against him in the community of
physicists.” ‘
Question Worthiness
Donahue and 18 other members
of the University’s physics depart-
ment -wrote to The,Pitt News, ob-
jecting ‘ to the conferral of such
a ‘degree. They protested because,
according to Dr. Ezra Newman,

“'1 associate professor, “We don’t feel,

...»Lment,” said Garfunkel. “Either -he‘

he is worthy of the degree or be-
ing held up for emulation. We
don’t like the way he argues his
position nor do we like the man-
ner-in which he attacked Dr.
Robert Oppenheimer’s character.”
Professor Myron Garfunkel
elaborated by saying, ‘fTeller
used, his scientiﬁc reputation,
and he is a good scientist, to
pass off specious things as
authoritative.” Or as associate
professor ‘John Townsend, put it,
“Teller presents scientiﬁc hy-
potheses as scientiﬁc facts.”

For example, according to Gar-
funkel, Teller has' written that
the Russians violated the mora-
torium by testing‘ underground.
“None of us haveseen any evid-
ence of this other than Teller’s,
and’ he doesn’t back up this state-

is violating security or telling us

something that isn’t true.”
Want Deﬁnition

' T-eller-s also implies in his "writ-
ings that radiation in small doses
is helpful and 90 _per cent of
-America’s population would sur-
“vive a nuclear war. “But ‘he
doesn’t say_ what kind of nuclear

I war,” Garfunkel hastened to add.

DA

“Sure, we could save 98 per cent
if we dig down far enough.” .
According to Donahue, Teller
writes that if we have» to ﬁght
a war, it could be a limited one
. in the sense that nuclear weap-
ons will only be ‘used-in a cer-
_ tain area. “Teller -says that a
war would not need to involve
missiles, falling on the United
States,” D o n a h u e explained.
“Statements like this are clear-
ly realistic."

Donahue feels that what Teller '

actually believes and what he
writes in his books are two differ-
ent things. “From ﬁrst hand ex-
perience I can -tell you what his
position really is,” Donahue re-
vealed. _ _
Better Alternative

“He believes that the Western
World and the Communist world
are engaged in a life and death
struggle. If the communists suc-
ceed, life would not be worth liv-
ing. All out nuclear war is a
better alternativethan life unde
communism. '

“This is a defensible position,
it seems to me. It is one with
' which I happen to disagree, but
there are other scientists such
-as Eugene Wigner who hold it
frankly and to whom I would be
happy to see an honorary degree
awarded.”

1954, Dr. Robert Oppen-

, In
/lire-imer, who played a key role in

the. development of the atomic

.-bomb, was declared a security risk

   
   

by the ' Atomic Energy Commis-

an, “'Iv‘_ell-_
 .

that raised a serious question, im-
plying that Oppenheimer was a
security risk because Oppenheim-
er disagreed with him about the
development/ of the hydrogen
bomb.”
‘Dirty Turn’

Teller worked under Oppen-
heimer, and Donahue feels that
“Teller did him a very dirty
turn. If Teller had not testiﬁed

_the way he did, it would have
been very difficult to have had

Oppenheimer declared a security
risk,” Donahue concluded.

It was just announced that
Oppenheimer will receive the
AEC’s Fermi Award, a symbolic
attempt to clear his name.
Ironically, Teller won the
award last year. --

The professors felt that the
faculty should be asked to ‘ap-
prove honorary degrees “out of
politeness” as Garfunkel put it,
especially .when a controversial
ﬁgure is involved. They pointed
out that many universities have
such a policy. Only last month at
Cambridge, 70 instructors pro-
tested the proposed conferral of an
honorary’ degree’on Lord Hail-
sham to prove that they did not
endorse his remarks. The instruc-
tors had their way.

] Political l7.‘uror'Unforeseen

Teller Was Dean Craft’s Idea

By JOHN POSTLEWAIT

William B. Crafts, Dean of
Men, is credited with initiat-
ing Edward Teller’s invitation
to speak at honors convoca-
tion. Crafts explained that at

the time he thought of Teller

as a possibility he had done no
research on Teller, as a political
ﬁgure, and had no idea of the
complications which would follow.

The purpose for considering
Teller was solely for his scien-
tiﬁc achievements. “I now feel
even more strongly that we must
look at a man’s previous achieve-
ments,” when granting « honorary
degrees,” Crafts said.

“If a man has acted so as to.
violate legal standards of patriot-
ism, he should not be honored,
but if he has acted in conscious-
ness in expressing himself, yet at
the same time making himself un-

popular, I think he should be‘

honored.”
No Outlaw
Crafts said he thinks Teller’s
achievements can truly be con-

sidered outstanding. “I don’t be-
lieve his conduct was outside the
ﬁeld of the law, or would brand
him as unpatriotic.” Crafts added.
Summarizing, Crafts said he
thought the University had a
just cause to grant Teller his
degree, and that Teller’s views
on, nuclear testing and the poli-
tical aspects of his accomplish-
ments should not be considered
when granting a doctor of sci-
ence degree. , _ I
Dr. David Halliday, Dean 0
the division of natural sciences
and acting co-ordinator of the
space research center, presented
the degree to Teller. Professor
Halliday stated, “Beyond ‘any
question, Teller is one of the
country’s leading scientists.”

Halliday, however, refused to
commit himself when he’ said,

“I do not wish to make a public‘

statement about any political as-
pects involved with the degree
given to Dr. Teller. I do believe

_ everything that I included in my

speech when I presented him
with the degree. However,- no in-
ference of my political views

In his speech, Halliday enumer-
ated the various scientiﬁc achieve-
ments Teller has accomplished in
his career. Halliday presented the
degree to Teller, not because he
necessarily agreed with granting
it to him, but because he was re-
presenting his department.

Sage Remarks

By Bob Smizik

Sports Editor

 

Baseball coach Bobby Lewis will enter his season opener
against Syracuse April 20 as conﬁdent as Bear Bryant was for
his premier last fall against Georgia. Lewis doesn’t have any
inside information on his rival, but he does know what his
playerscan do.

“I might be putting too much pressure on the boys by
what I’ve been saying,” Lewis said, “but it so happens that
they are good ball-players. If they weren’t any good I’d tell
them so, but they are good.”

Lewis has special praise for his pitching and his defense.
“We can hold our own with anyone in pitching and defense,”
said Lewis. “In Jim Sylvis and John Carlisle, I know I’ve got
two pitchers who can beat anyone. Dave Sauer, Andy Alex
and Carl Oettinger are ﬁghting it out for the other starting
berth". ' '
There is no question that LE-vis’s inﬁeld of John

Cioili, Ron Supansic, Al Riccuiti and Paul Martha is out-
standing. Sylvis said, “It’s great to know you’ve got guys
like that behind you. It's the best inﬁeld l’ve ever had to
work with.” —

Lewis’ optimism hedges a bit when he talks about his
hitting. This appears to be the weak spot on the team, and
although Lewis tends to belittle its importance, the lack of
some good consistent hitting could hamper the team’s chances
of making the NCAA playoffs this summer.

Weakness At Bat

‘‘If anything, hitting is our “weakness,” admits Lewis.
‘.‘I’m not real worried about it, though, since I feel our pitch-
ing and defense will permit us to be somewhat lacking in our
hitting and still win. , .

-“I feel that if we can get nine hits a game, which means
that each man would have to go only 1-4, which isn’t much,
we’ll be okay in the hitting department,” Lewis continued.

Lewis must look on his pitching and defense the way

Alvin Dark looks at'Willie Mays since the Panthers hit
better than .250 last year (.263) and came out with only
an 11-6 record, which is good, but not good enough to
make the NCAA playoffs.

Lewis will have to get better hitting from his catchers
and outﬁelders if he is to get a .250 average from each man.

“Our hitting came from only a few players last year,”

said Lewis. “Thcy’d get their hits and then we’d have a bunch 

of outs coming to the plate. This year I expect to have a
more consistent attack.”
Catchers Should Improve -

According to Lewis, “Competition should make our 
catchers better hitters. Supsura’s hitting was poor last year, 

(.140) but whoever catches this year, either Supsura, Tim
.Grgurich or Doug Chambers, will do better, I’m"sure.

“Our outﬁelders will do better this year, because they
couldn’t have as bad a year as last season,” said'Lewis.
Dick Wagner, Ray Barton and Drew Williamson shared .
two of the outﬁeld spots last season and hit .167, .172 and
.238, respectively. - ‘

Quite a bit of the team’s success will hinge on whether
Lewis gets improvement from these positions. He knows he
will get good hitting from Riccuiti, Supansic and outﬁelder

Corky Cuthbert. Martha and Ciofﬁ have also shown that 

they can hit, but it takes more than ﬁve men to make a
sound lineup. '

Lewis will have to come up with some better hitters or
else the baseball team's dreams of the NCAA world series
may be as phonyas the Los Angeles Dodgers’ world series
ambitions were last year. ’

He continued that “the Central
Blood Bank would be pleased to
receive individual donations from
students at least 18 years old."

tion or sale‘of blood may be ob-
tained from the Pittsburgh Cen-
tral Blood Bank,.,3601 Fifth Ave.
