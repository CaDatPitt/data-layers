Students
Plan
Traffic
Protest

A demonstration in protest of

the traffic situation "at Fifth and C

Tennyson is gathering large stu-
dent support. The students will de-
monstrate in the near future if they
are not soon assured that a traffic
light will be installed at the in-
teresection.

Student Government has in-
formed Chancellor Wesley Pos-
var of its intention to organize
this demonstration if immediate
action is not taken by the city.

Jack Freeman, Executive As-
sistant to the Chancellor, has cal-
led David Craig, Pittsburgh Safe-
ty Director to see if the proposed
stop light would be installed.
Chancellor Posvar has sent a hand-
written letter to the Public Safe-

.ty Building also. They were told

that Craig is presently out of town.

SG President Ken Schueler wrote
a letter to the city administration
requesting this stop light last Aug-
ust. He was promised that a traf-
fic light would soon be installed.

If a signal light is not construct-
ed at Fifth and Bellefield soon,
the Students will stage their de-»
monstration. If the demonstration
is held, the mass media will be
invited to attend it in order to
present this issue to the public.

Fair Set   InterestMovement

“I don’t care if someone wants to produce a dramatic reading of the
speeches of Lyndon Johnson as long as the students start doing their
own thing.” This statement by Mat Grant, president of the University
of Pittsburgh Theater (UPT) expresses his aims for the coming drama-

Sunday .

The annual Activities Fair will '

take place October 6 and 7 in the

SU Ballroom. Booths will be open ‘
_ on Sunday from 1 to 4 and on

Monday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.

The Fair is sponsored by the
Women Students
and the Men’s Council. Since
the Fair falls during Parents
Weekend there will be refresh-
ments supplied for the parents
by the Junior Class of AWS. Jun-
iors from AWS and‘MC will act
as hostesses and hosts to fresh-
men and parents in attendance.

To make booths more readily
identifiable, boys’ groups will de-
corate their booths in blue, girls
will decorate theirs in yellow,
and mixed groups will use a com-
bination of the two colors. Co-
chairman Jim Ranii indicated
that the Fair has much better re-

.‘ sponse this year. With the ad-

dition of booths from the new

organizations on campus, there‘

"will be ‘aftotal. of thirty-five areas

tic season.

He has initiated a movement

to gain student interest in the pro- ‘

gram. “We want them to realize
they’ve got a real opportunity to
do theater here and can put on re-.
views, .plays, and extravaganzas
of their own,” Grant explained.

Dr. Leland Starnes, former dir-
rector of the Yale University
Dramat, is the new director of
UPT. He supports Grant’s pro-
gram and places special emphas-
is on attracting ‘rfreshmen.
Starnes contends there is a defin-
ite need “to produce shows in
this entertainment starved city.”
He feels UPT can accomplish
this since it was “the only public
theater that did not fold last year.”

Grant and Starnes assert that
there is a lot more to theater
for students than might be assum-
ed from the outside. They feel
that there is nowhere a student
can associate with the major tal-

ent and at the same time learn about
lighting, carpentry, and sewing.

 

Lantern Night,

. by PAUL ST. JOHN

The appearance of small black
cannisters on the belts of cam-
pus policeman has been a recent
cause of concern to some Univer-
sity students.

Last Monday, a Pitt News staff

member spoke with one of the
campus police that “he has been

friendly with for the past few .
months. The policeman showed him

his latest acquirement, a small
black container. The staffer jok-
ingly asked him if it was a can of
hairspray. The guard replied that
it was not and that the cannister
contained chemical mace, a sup-
posedly harmlessly weapon that
has recently enjoyed widespread
popularity in controlling demon-
strators,and subduing criminal sus-
pects prior to arrest. Asked‘ if he
was being kidded, the staff mem-
ber was assured that the container
did, .indeed, contain chemical
mace.

A Pitt News staff writer, also
friendly with the policeman,
was told the same thing. She told
him she read that mace could pos-
sibly be harmful to the central
nervous system. To this, the
policeman replied that it just
“wasn’t true.” Another police-
man, when asked to do so, re-
fused to show her the lable of the
cannister.

The same campus guard said,
Sunday, that he was carrying
mace in place of a gun. Later in
the conversation he denied that it
was really mace and claimed that
it was only “tear gas.”

What is really in these contain-
ers? Do they contain chemical
mace or tear gas? What’s the dif-
ference, anyway? Why all this
concern? '

According to the U.S. Surgeon
General’s Report (May, 1968):
“Mace may be more harmful than
was originally believed.” An in-
vestigation has also been mae by
Dr. Lawrence Rose, a San Fran-
cisco Opthamologist. He reveal-
ed that the Federal Government
knew that the main active ingredi-
ent in chemical mace, methyl chlo-
roform, is a “central nervous sys-
tem depressant.”

Dr. Rose cited the “National

' Clearing House for Poison \Con-

trol Centers. published by the U.
S. Public Health Service, which
lists the effects of methyl chlo-
roform as: “headache, lassi-
tude, facial flushing, incoor-
dination, confusion, vertigo, severe
hypotension, coma,” and possible
“peripheral vascular collapse”
resulting in “death from respira-

-v tory arrest.” In other words, the

blood vessels in the lungs col-

"  lapse. and make it impossible to
 breathe. ]

News   Mace Makes

CampusScene

  

San Francisco, Los Angeles,
and a number of other U.S. cities
have discontinued the use of_mace
(almost a year after the eye'med-
ic’s original warning in June of
1957). Last May the San Francis-
co Board of Supervisors passed a

resolution banning the use of .

mace in city. Later in May the
Board voted to suspend police use

of all‘ chemical weapons in San?

Francisco until approved by the
Health Department.

While other cities are finally

getting around to_banning the use» - t

of MACE, it seems that our cam-
pus police are just catching on to

it. Or is it just tear gas? We have_  I‘

heard two different stories. One
policeman claims it is not mace
and one says it definitely is.

In an article in the Pitt News 

(Wednesday, September. 25) " a-
statement was made that “a cam-
pus policeman was seen with a
can of chemical mace . . .” That

was a week ago and the Pitt News _ l M
has yet to hear any comment or de- -

nials, official or otherwise, as to

the credibility of the statement or '

‘the contents of the cans.
Why did one of the guards (the

one that claimed it was tear. ’ _.
gas) refuse to show one of the .

staff the (label of the container?‘

Why wasn’t there an official an- -.

nouncement in the first place when"
the police got the chemical spray
weapons ? What really is, in"
those cans? '

Nixon Speaks On Youth’st Role

Will Have

Action’ Says Nixon

“In a Nixon Administration,
students will have a better alter-
native than to take to the streets
to protest. They are going to have
a piece of the action,” so stated
Republican presidential candi-
date Richard M. Nixon on estab-
lishing his new “Student Coali-
tion.” '

Nixon went on to state that the
first task of this new coalition
would be to discuss and "propse
ways of involving educational in-
stitutions “more heavily and di-
rectly” in developing solutions to
the local problems of housing, ed-
ucation, and jobs. David ,Eisen-
hower, national c h a i r m a n of
Youth for Nixon feels that this
program will elicit additional stu-
d e n t participation a c t i o n pro-
grams in ghettos.

This new coalition will be head-
ed by Sam Williams and John
Campbell, both formerly of the
Rockefeller youth effort, the
“New Majority.” Williams will
graduate this December from
Georgia Tech. Campbell is a 1966

_ graduate of Duke University and

a 1968 graduate of the Wharton

School at the University of Penn- ’

sylvania. He is presently on leave
from the management consulting
firm of Price Waterhouse, Inc-

Nixon feels that this coalition
will be not only vital to his cam-
paign for the presidency but -also
for the N i x on administration
should there be one. “Thev are

, intent upon creating a meaning-

oriented society, rather than a
success-oriented society . . . this
generation of American youth is
idealistic and activits — it is mo-
tivated by social concerns and
blessed with a social conscience,”
said Nixon. This is a time when
there are more talented young
people available and willing to
contribute than ever before, and
Nixon hopes to recruit as many as
possible for his effort through-the
visits of. young Republican office
holders to college campuses.

He went on to cite various ex-
amples of student participation in
alleviating the problems of the

‘Piece Of A

  
  
   
  
   

city such as Washington’s Repub-
lican governor, Dan Evan’s' pro-‘
gram for Seattle tutoring by col-
lege students and New York Re-
publican Mayor John Lindsay's
New York City Urban Corps, a
summer ‘intern program through .-
which students worked together?‘
with the city government to solve -  V
the problems of poverty in that

- city. *

Nixon thinks that by helping 
solve urban problems through his ‘_ I?’
new student coalition will enable1;:’, ‘ff
them to “look forward to the fu- .175;
ture with hope.” It will also util- ‘
ize thier full resources in the so-
lution of our “national problems.”

On student power, Nixon rec-
ognized the concern of the ‘stu-
dents for their institutions of v_
learning and hopes that they will 1 T
be able to expand the “positive
involvement of youth in universvi-.
ty life and in the ‘educational pro-1
cess.” His urban problem-solving
coalition would, ‘he hoped, be ad-
vised by regular university per-
sonnel a nd presented by th.e'~in'.
with a specific series of proposals.
on the problem. ’  I
As to student political involve.-' 
ment, Nixon has stated that “We ‘ ’
should be proud . . . of this new
generation of Americans.” He
feels that they are going to bring
into public recognition the fact
that “leaders who treat morality; .-
and politics apart will never uné  
derstand either.”  *

1-age NEWS-Wednesday, October 2, mos

 D t ’   ti n  
I  ‘G A number of very significant developments have occurred
G " over the past week concerning a possible solution to the horren-

7,'..;‘ dous traffic situation at the corner of Fifth Ave. and Tenny-
'  son St.»

At this time, the lives of many students are threatened be-

. cause there is, as yet, no traffic light at this dangerous inter-
" " section. A great many students have reacted to this situation
:;  with dismay and disgust. ‘And this is one issue for which a

.. ' iggpodmany students are willing to fight. 4, “ I
"L A number of Student Government (SG) Senators are in the

process of planning a demonstration. The demonstration re-

“ solution will be presented at Thursday night’s SG meeting.

The concerned SG Senators voiced their dismay Monday

-"Executive Assistant to the Chancellor Jack Freeman.

-They asked Freeman or the Chancellor to call Mayor Barr,

 City Traffic Engineer Anthony Miscimarra, and Pittsburgh

Safety Director Craig in order to voice the widespread.con-
cern over the safety hazzards on thecorner of Fifth and Ten-

 nyson.

Freeman placed the calls and notified the students that
Chancellor Posvar had written a strongly worded letter to Mr.

" :Craig complaining about the fatal traffic situation around

thecampus. Dr. Posvar. asked thattraffic signals be im-
mediatedly installed at the corner of Fifth and Tennyson.

 The letter was hand delivered to Craig’s office Monday af-
, , ternoon. In the interum, a partolman will be stationed at the
, dangerous corner. ’ . ‘

The students, however, followed up this ad_ministrative
action. They called Mr. Miscimarra’s.office to ask the City

"nient had been reached concerning the installation of traffic
signals at Tennyson and Fifth. In the absence of Miscamarra,

 V City Traffic Inspector Mayer Deroy told the students that a

contract installment agreement had been reached, and that

 » "traffic signals would be installed sometime in October. He

said that Tennyson and Fifth contract would receive top
priority.
.- The students, nevertheless, demanded that Mr. Miscimarra

 himself, make a verbal or written commitment. If Miscizmarra

says that traffic lights will be installed early in October,
a demonstration, according the group of SG Senator’s would
not be in order.'H‘owever, if Mr. Miscamarra cannot confirm an
October installation date, a demonstration protesting the com-
placency, of the City Government will be held, according to
the SG group. ' -

THE PITT NEWS is pleased to see a gr-‘eat deal of stu-
dent iniative in this area. In past years, many students might
have said, “what can we.do, we can’t fight city hall or

’ Mayor Barr.” But this hapless statement isn’t being heard to-

day, for many students are fighting a worthy cause-—a cause

 . that involves the future safety of all students at the University.

The question of a demonstration is now up in the air,

but this is not the significant point. The issue is the sharp

student concern and the student participation in this contro-

versy. For once, students here are willing to fight for neces-
sary change. And we hope the light goes on. e

For as soon as we moved in.
it was too late to turn back.

set us straight about the rules so
that we would have no trouble
adapting to dorm life. Curfew re-

.us with the news —— no lunches.

“Eat at the Towers,” they told us.
' SURE, AT $1.20 per day, that
comes to. something like $85 (sor-
ry about the math, malnutrition
weakens the 'mind), while Pitt
knocked a paltry $50 off our Room
and Board.

“O.K., then eat at the Tuck
Shop’_’, they said . . . . NEVER!
So we thought that we’d eat twice
as much at breakfast and din-
ner.

Sure, breakfast from 7-8 a.m.
“no seconds on meat, potatoes,
vegetables or bread,” they tell us
at dinner. Most of us have re-

they meant PAT busses (now

The Different Drummer 

Is It A Zoo? A Farm? Or A
Love-In? No It’s Hillman Library

by BRUCE LEVENSON
' Staff News Editor '

Any attempts to make the Stu-
dent Union a place for student
gathering have thus far been ut-
terly useless. Even with remodel-
ing and publicity and every-
thing else, it just cannot be done.
as the center fo r socializing
Schenley Hall is obsolete.

If you have some time to kill
and you feel like shooting the
breeze with a few of your bud-
dies, why go to the Student Un-
ion? What do you think the Hill-
man Library was built for ?

NO ONE GOES to the library
to study. There are other places
for that, like home, like the dorms,
like—the_ Student Union. The Hill-
man is the University's “in place”
for socializing.

Clique groups all have their
regular meeting spots in the li-

brary——much like a nighttime ex-.

tension of the Tuck Shoppe.

One friend of mine, who is a
sort of a mayor of the second floor.
once gave me a tour of the build-
ing. “So-and-so sits right here
every night,” the mayor—_beamed.
“Whats -iz - name is always over

‘there. too. some people even stu- ! _ _ I‘, ,
       I      I  “.?9“V9”‘“S’

Another friend and I made the
foolish mistake of going to the
Hillman to study last Monday
night. We sat at a table among five
boisterous young ladies. “Are you

from Beaver?” one of them shriek-

ed in a whispe};._;to a boy at an-
other table. “I overheard part
of your conversatiojn. So am I.
Doyouknow.....

At just about the same time a
group of guys came over to the
table. One gentleman gently kis-
sed one of the girl’s hands which
proves that chivalry isn't dead.

ANOTHER GIRL came run-
ning over to talk to one of the
other girls. “Do you know that so-
and-so’s been dating thing?"
“What!” the other girl exclaim-
ed. After a cold stare from yours
truly they left to carry on their
conversation elsewhere. Shortly
afterward, we seated ourselves at
a different table.

Three men were whispering at
the far end of the table. But. we
couldn’t complain} being as this
was one of the quiter tables.
Alas! This shadow of silence
was too good ._o,last. A pair of
young ladies’

  
 

“ted themselves _-
on theother _side.of our tableand--

   

ed that we wanted Pitt rules.
Not Mt. Mercy rules. Housing
Board came to hear our proposals.
We decided to meet with SG Presi-
dent Ken Schueler and Housing
Board officials and vote on Rules.

PANIC STRUCK: we, decided
Mt. Mercy rules were better. We

began to circulate a petition fa- 

voring those rules, only to be in-
formed “we are on Pitt rules.”
O.K. then an Emergency meet-

ing was called. House and social 

chairmen and representatives

’ were elected to serve on the

Housing Board.

But we were under Mercy
Rules, except that each Pitt co-
ed found a mimographed page of
Pitt curfew rules under her door.
Now We’re so confused we don’t
know who are we? Where are
we? What we are supposed to
do?

We have no rules. We’re free‘

to do what we want. No one even
knows that We’re here! ! ! Can’t we
do anything? Won’t somebody

' help us?

Excuse me, I think I’ll sit in
the corner and cry.

“with the three guys. By this
time my friend and I were pul-
ling our hair out.

One of the girl’s looked at my
pa1’s textbood and asked, “What
class is that book for?”

I GO TO Point Park,” he re.
strainedly replied.

9 “Oh!” she sputtered, “Then
you must have come here looking
for dates!”

The private study booths were
not v- much of an improvement.
The kid beside me kept adjusting
his chair. He’d pull in close, then
he’d lean back. then he’d put his
feet up ’on the table of the booth.

I can t get comfortable,” he

whispered to no one in particular. ~

Another boy kept looking around
and shuffling papers. Every, five
minutes or so he’d tap the shoulder
of the boy next to him, “Dave 1
can’t study.”

_While looking for a new loca-
tion. we saw a boy and girl at a
table, making out and muttering
sweet nothings.

wanted." I told my friend motion- 1

Traffic Tight.
‘Every Place’

Editor, The Pitt News:

I read your article about the
traffic problem around Pitt with
a certain amount of pleasure -
it’s sort of amusing to watch some-
one try to get the Traffic Engi-

, neering Department‘ to behave in

an intelligent way. I have had a

little correspondence with’ An-'

thony Miscimarra about minor

traffic problems and I have form-.

ed the opinion that he is not com-
petent to handle them, much less
major ones.

This will not come as a revela-
tion to anyone with a car. Person-
ally, I think it will take a slaugh-
ter along the lines of the Custer
massacre to move the T. E. De-
partment to action.

On the subject of parking prob-
lems, you might be interested to
know that there is a parking sit-
uation around the Public Safety
Building that is just as bad as the
one at Pitt. The only differences
are that there are no meters there,
just no problem parking signs and
that no one gets ticketed. '

When I complained that stu-

, dents at Pitt paid fines constant-

ly for illegal parking while noth-
ing was done about the situation
created by our minions of law and
order downtown, I received the
enclosed letter from David Craig
assuring me that matters would
be set right.

The situation is unchanged. I
suggest that if anyone is upset
about getting parking tickets here
they apply a little pressure on the
people who park illegally around
the court house and the Public
Safety Building. Perhaps if the
police and meter maids have as
much trouble as students finding
a place to park legally all day
they will have a little sympathy.

Sincerely,
Jon Orloff

‘SEX’ Set Story Straight

' Editor, The Pitt News:

After 10 months of hard work
on the forum on Sex and Sexual-
ity by a student committee, the
Sept. 23 article, “Health Direc-
tor Coordinates Sex Symposium,”
was a little surprising. The title
was as misleading as the -article
which was 90 per cent incorrect
and 10 per cent incoherent. In
fact, aboutthe only correct state-
ment in the article was that Dr.
Douglass Thompson is director
of the Health Center.

The forum on Sex and, Sexual-
ity will be held Oct. 17, .18, and
19. Panelists are from UCLA,
Santa Monica, Winston - Salem,
New York, Carnegie-Mellon, La

Students Needed F or A Filling
Of Party Campaign Positions

by JUDI GALARDI

Most students who were disil-
lusioned by the defeat of Senator
Eugene McCarthy seem to have

A extended their disillusionment to

all candidates, local and national.
Edward Early is a man running
in Legislative District 29 who has

reacted to these and all students. .

At an interview with the Pitt
News, Mr. Early stated, “There’s
a definite place for these students,
such as within the campaigns of

A promising, young candidates.”

Early then suggested a few of
the positions that students are eli-

gible. to hold. “Students should
i put forth. an organized effort to

get people out to register. They
can compile street lists, work at

l ’ the polling places, canvas door to
’ door, and, most importantly, they

can research the facts of issues
for the candidates.” He contin-
ued to say, “This researching is
positively an important job which
requires a great deal of responsi-
bility and loyalty on the part of a
student. I don’t think a student-
should accept a job he cannot
handle, and I think violent dem-
onstrations hurt a candidate more

' than help him)’

I The candidate has been involv-
ed with. the educational, business
and civic organizations in his

‘area. He is a graduate of Du- »
- quesne University; who taught at

the education program at the Al-
legheny County _Workhouse and

l . at a school for emotionally‘ dis- 1
-turbed boys. As managing direc-

tor of the Contract Hardware Di-

Vlvision of Allen -and Co., he has
. been involved with the‘construc-

     

tion of new buildings within the
University. He was director of
United Mental Health and active,
in other organizations,

Concerning handicapped chil-
dren, Mr. Early said, “I believe
our society has stressed the needs
of the socially poor, and has not
emphasized enough the mentally
retarded. The late John Kennedy
started people on the road to help
the mentally retarded in his ad-
ministration, and I am working to
see this continue.”

Mr. Early then gave his views
on the Vietnam War. “Let’s not
waste brain power in Vietnam,
but when the occasion arises we
must bear arms to defend our
country. Our forefathers fought
and died for us, and it is our pa-
triotic duty to defend out country
for the generation of the future.
However, the idea of old men

creating wars and young men/
fighting them is a philosophy I/

don’t adhere to. Capable leaders
make decisions to send young
people to war. This is a necessary
factor to protect our country.

“The demonstrations on the
part of the students against the
unpopular decisions only jeopa-
dize the students’ image with our

 coun_try. Instead the student

should work, and work hard, to
insure that onlylthe most capable

. men. are elected through the bal-

Induction Refused

Celebrationof Freedom ‘

Asks Student Support

A celebration of freedom will
be held tomorrow at 7 :30 p.m. on
the Cathedral of Learning lawn
off the corner of Bigelow Blvd.
and Fifth Ave. Joshuah Chason, a
University graduate teaching as-
sistant of history, will be refus-
ing induction Friday. Joshuah
will explain why he turned down

his student deferment this past
December and why he will re-
fuse induction. .

Chason has been teaching here
at the University for two years.
With his refusal to accept the
laws of conscription, Joshuah may
be spending a few years (three to
five) in prison.

Another man who will be at the
celebration of freedom will be
Jack Hayes. Jack is a student here
at the University, and is a five
year Marine veteran, who served
in Vietnam. He has turned down

his 4-A deferment, which means
he has already served. He feels
the government has no right to
tell him when to fight, therefore,
shaping his future for him.

Jim Coyne, Joan Baez’s gui-
tarist, will lead the students in

to the chancellor’s residence-~-

where they will ask him to “join
us in our affirmation of liberty,
our rejection of the University’s
connection with conscription, and
prove that the University is a
community, with its members re-
acting with personal responsibil-
ity to problems that face all of
us.”

Joshuah will be refusing induc-
tion Friday morning at 6:45 p.m.
in the Federal Building. Trans-
portation will be available to stu-
dents by calling Chason at 683-
8146. I

AWS Cyicven Petition Asking
Support For Student Rights

The Tuesday meeting oi the

_AWS was -the scene of a heated

discussion concerning a petition
on student rights presented by
Pitt News reporter David Rosen-
blum.

This petition was drawn up by
Mr. Rosenblum on his own initia-
tive. He hoped that it would be
endorsed by AWS and MDC, in
order that the true voice of the
students might be heard.

This petitionstated that “now
is the time for a change in the

“we aregurging the administra-
tion to accept the fact that stu-
dents are sufficiently qualified

“If this just concession is not
made,” the. petition concluded,
“the undersigned fe el that it
would be only appropriate to pur-
sue a more positive course of ac-
tion.”

“By a positive course of action,”
said Rosenblum, “I mean a dem-
onstration. ”

Rosenblum told the members of
AWS that he wanted to ask their
opinion before presenting the pe-
tition to the student body. Many
of them answered eagerly.

One girl said students, especial-
ly freshmen, needed the advice
of the ‘administration. “But,” ar-
gued another, “if we don’t know

something, I’m sure we can ask.
We’re responsible enough.”

Another member vehemently

told Rosenblum, “I oppose this '
whole thing. We’re only here for -

three or four years. What if a
group of hippies take over years
from now?”

“Well,” argued a supporter of-
. the petition, “what if the admin-

istration changes in a few years?
They could put curfews right
back on us.” ’

Rosenblum pointed out the im-
portance of the demonstration
clause. “If t he administration
finds that the students will not
demonstrate they will not have to
act on our demands.

When asked if they would be
willing to sign the petition, four
said “yes”,ifour said they would
if the demonstration clause were

dropped and six needed more

time to decide.

  Teaching Assistant,

Refuses Induction,
Defends Constitution

by JUDI GALARDI

Joshua C h a s a n , .a University
teaching assistant, will be sent to
prison in a few months for"refus-
ing induction. This means that
the University is being directly af-
fected by the archaic laws of the
Selective Service System. They
have already grabbed members
from the student body to fight in
a war that is totally without cause
and without a sign of victory.

Now the laws are taking away
the teachers here in our school.
We are being robbed of our in-
tellectual power. Taking away
teachers of a university is a way
of destroying our own nation. Ed-
ucation has always been the back-
bone of our democracy.

Conscription is deleting our ed-
ucation leaders. With laws the
way they are now, teachers who
can no longer adhere to conscrip-
tion will be sent to a country
where our presence isn’t even
wanted, let alone asked for.

Students here at the University
must give our students who are
resisting a powerful backing. It

Promote Peace

Michael is Flack Discusses
Czechoslovakian Bridge

“Czechoslovakia always hoped
to serve as a peace promoting
bridge between the East and West.
However, a bridge’s main func-

tion is to be trodden upon,” ex-

plained Dr. Michael Flack, Uni-
versity professor of International
and Intercultural Affairs, during

his lecture Monday in the SU,

Supper Room.

“We can only emphasize as hu-
man beings at the cruxifiction of
a nation whose s h e e r political
misfortune stems from its geo-
graphic location,” said Dr. Flack
concerning the invasion of Czech-
oslovakia by 650,000 Soviet Union
troops. _

According to‘ Dr. Flack, the
seizing of the leading function-
a r i e s of Czechoslovakia, e n -
gendered three results:

Firstly, the Czech Communist
party emerged as a stong national

force after having gained a “new -

lease on life” due to the invasion.

Men’s Glee Club

Creates Fine Music  

The sounds of the Negro spirit-
ual filled the room. Philip C. Cav-
anaugh, music fellow at the Uni-
versity, had begun rehearsing the
35 members of the Pitt Men’s
Glee Club.

The organization, which is the
oldest on campus, has been rep-
resenting the University vocally
since 1890. This-nationally rec-
ognized group travels to the top
women’s schools and performs in
two major home concerts every
year. In the last three years, the
group has traveled over 6,000
miles.

Dick Kilburg, who has been
with the club for three years, said,
“Traveling is one of the best as-
pects of the club. We often stay
in private homes and get to know
the people of the various areas.”

~ The social type glee club is not
all business and no fun. President
Jerry Schorin said, “You can have
humor and light sarcasm and still
create fine music. This is what
makes ours a unique group.” He‘
went on to say, “We are a very
close group and perform and re-
hearse in a very relaxed manner.”

Cavanaugh, who has been di-
rector of the group for four years,
agreed. He said, “They set their
own levels of achievement and
reach them. This is a constantly
improving group.”

The members are undergrads and
grad students. Prospective mem-
bers are auditioned and inter-
viewed b y th e club’s executive
board. A sense of humor, the de-
sire to travel, and a good singing
voice are the major requirements.

Secondly, the invasion served
to unite the Czechs and Slovaks
in a common revulsion, which is
a -bright prospect for the two na-
tions of Czechoslovakia.

Thirdly, the invasion placed a
lasting stigma on the Russians.
They will always be seen as the
occupiers that killed 81 Czechs
and Slovaks.

T h e Czechoslovakian c r i s i s
-from the Soviet angle brings sev-
eral points to light. The Soviets

believed that a military invasion,‘

would elicit strong‘ reactions in
the world, but no military re-
sponse. The invasion would also
cancel the set arrangements be-
tween Moscow and Washington,
making impossible the Johnson-
Kosygin meeting scheduled for
August 29. “The occupation of
Czechoslovakia was certain to

slow down the removal of U. S. .
armed forces in W e s t e r n ‘Eur-I

ope,” Dr. Flack noted.

-The Soviet Union operated in’

full awareness of the fact that the
invasion would I-elicit condemna-
tion by many Communist parties
in the world. The_Soviet leaders
still proceeded, it must have
seemed to them that continued in-
action would have courted even
greater dangers,” explained Dr.

Flack. In other words, military‘

occupation fro m a Soviet view-
point, was imperative.

Is Dave Hart Really A
Deserving Scapegoat?

by Roy Jacobs
Sborts Editor

 

moons

' "When you win you get the credit and when you lose, you 're the goal off! all. When I look lhejob lac-
epled this .eapons:'bI'Iily. "—-Dave Hart, Head Coach.

 There is something terribly wrong with the football_team.
Land along with the losing, there are a lot of "people trying to

make a goat out of Dave Hart. In fact, Monday, one IE profes-
;-‘sor asked his class why’ they hadn’t hung Hart in effigy after
- gjy Saturday’s 38-15 loss to West Virginia.

1 Well, hanging a coach in effigy never accomplishes very
 much, except that it relieves student tensions and provides a few
 laughs. What is really needed ‘around here is something that
would relieve the Panthers’ tensions—-and not necessarily those
1'; on Satruday afternoons.

There’s a need to get things together. And soon. Players are
.;:talring’behind coaches’ backs. Coaches are talking behind play-
. ers’ backs. And students are muttering behind players’ and
“ coaches’ backs.

if '. Alumni aren’t taling behind anybody’s back. They're just
calling the Athletic Department and protesting, yelling, de-
manding, and pleading. Some are just registering their outrage,
while others —— many of whom have never taken an active inter-
’ est in Panther football before—are calling for Hart’s dismissal.

Why has there been such revulsion on the part of Panther
fans? The answer ‘to this question only leads into the core of the
problem while opening up several other lines of questioning.

Wasn’t this supposed to be “The Year the Panther Begins
. to Growl?” Didn’t one national magazine pick us to finish 6-4?
Didn’t our own Athletic Director hint at the possibility of a 7-3
. season? In short, student, alumni, and—most important—team
 hopes were built sky-high for the season. ‘

-. predictions. He said we were better, but so were most of our
opponents. In the end, though, he is still as guilty as some of
the ‘rest of us for building hopes too high.

,, Then came UCLA and a 56-point’loss. Up until that time,
the team spirit was great. Everybody was a believer. But now-
two weeks later—very few players are still believers. Some are
down on the coaches, others are just questioning their faith in
* the coaches.

_ In either case, it is a remarkable turnabout in two weeks.
The letdown after UCLA is understandable, but the ‘Panthers-—
_;: almost to a man—believed they could and would beat West Vir-
ginia. Yet, they lost by 23 points. Why? '

* It is the feeling of this writer that last Saturday_—Septem-
her 28, l968—Dave Hartand staff were outcoached by Jim Car-
. len and staff. This does not necessarily mean that Dave Hart
 and staff are incompetent or should be fired, as many people
:5 have said. It simply means that last week West Virginia was the
i better run team on the field. Again, why?

i ‘ “ For one, there appeared to be confusion on the Pitt sidelines.
And confusion on the sidelines means confusion on the field.
And in the confusion there was apparently a breakdown in
 communication between players and coaches that prevented
 the Panthers from adjusting to the Mountaineer attack.

What other reason could there be for the players to claim
 they weren’t told how to adjust and for the coaches to claim
. » the players didn’t execute their adjustments?

There are many other little factors that go into developing
_ a team’s attitudes that are not evident to the fan in the stands.

Some of these will be dealt with more specifically in the next
 issue of the Pitt News.

. scapegoat. How many problems are initiated by a player’s assis-
't_ant coach and then projected onto the head coach? How many
other problems can be directed at the head of the whole athletic
; program or one _of his assistants?

, Yes, it’s an overworked story, but it is nevertheless still
true. The football program here is nowhere near where it should

be. Again, this is not the reason for losing to West Virginia.

_ There’s no excuse for that. But maybe, if there’s going to be

. -some house cleaning, it’s got to start at some other point than
at the head coach of the football team.

» Look for a minute at the other areas of major athletic im-

provement — wrestling and track. Both basically individual-
oriented sports. A couple Jerry Richeys and everything looks
brighter. Dave Adams is doing a great job with wrestling, but
that doesn’t deny the fact that three years ago the best wrestling
V coach in the country quit his job here. Why?

c There are other questions that need to be asked. Granted,
 they are far removed from a judgment of Dave Hart, but in the
near future it is hoped that some specifics can tie everything
together. 2 i. , ; , I ' ' j j ’ J ’ ,. ..

 

Coach Hart was optimistic, too. But he didn’t make any -I

Jerry Richey Stays

by BILL NAAB

Although Jerry Richey will be rested, assistant coach Gary
Meckley expects the cross country squad to breeze past Cleve-

land State this afternoon.

Meckley mentioned that while Richey will not run against compe-
tition, it doesn’t mean that he’ll be doing nothing. “Jerry will be do-
ing a lot of distance running. The distance work that he d_eos this week
shouldn’t fatigue him. It should be a big help,” explained Mecklev.

He also said that with the ex-
ception of three days, Richey will
be practicing the same as the rest

‘ of the squad. Moreover, Meckley

commented that the squad will
be practicing basically as they
have been,Aexcept that more
speed work will be included this
week.

Meckley added that the Cleve-
land State meet will be good for
th e t e a m. “They gauge them-
selves to Richey’s pace. Wednes-
day, they'll be running on thier
own. They can set their own
pace,” said Meckley.

In addition, he mentioned that
this season, unlike last season, the
squad has been fortunate. They
now have enough depth to com-
pete in elimination run-offs; thus
determining the traveling squad.

Bill Matajasic, who gained the

squad, is a good competitor, ac-
cording to Meckley. “He’s a lit-
tle guy who gives everything he
has. He performs well,” com-
mented Meckley. A .

Meckley indicated that he does-
_n’t believe.Clev'eland State to be-
nearly as tough as the four previ-
ous schools that the harriers have
‘faced. He analyzed that “Cleve-
land St. hasn’t had a cross coun-
try program. long enough to be a
solid threat.” '

Also, Meckley related that the
team hasn’t had any tremendous-
ly difficult meets yet. He said the
squad Wasn’t pointing toward the
Buffalo meet and probably could
have done better. He stated that
the practices are geared to the

A later, more difficult meets.

Moreover, Meckley believes
that ,the harriers are a confident
group. He explained, “the sopho-
mores went undefeated together
last season, and that confidence
has carried over to this season.”

As‘ for freshman Bob Hagner,
Meckley indicated that he’ll be
ready for the next freshmen meet.

The freshmen don’t compete un—.

remarked that the squad might
slack off a little in the meantime.

But, Meckley said, “they’ll pick _

Grid Positions “Switched.

by ART ROSENGARTEN

Closed practices a n d th e

grass and new surroundings of
Forbes Field have helped give
the football team a new lease on
life. i

“The boys enjoylbeing to them-
selves,” said head coach Dave
Hart. “They have not had an easy
time, but they are keeping the
faith and working hard.”

As with every team that is on
hard times, the Panthers have come
up with some changes of man-
power and positions. Some of

these switches have been neces-
sitated because of injuries.

Linebackers Ralph Cindrich
and "Lloyd Weston will probably
miss Saturday’s game due to leg
injuries. Also, linebacker Don Har-
rison is out for the season with a
fractured leg. -To help shore-up
the linebacking corps, fullback
Jeff Brown has been switched to
the middle linebacker slot.

The defensive secondary has
had a major overhaul job done on
it. Safety Bryant Salter has drawn
the assignment of man—to-man
coverage of the Panthers’ oppon-
ent’s top‘receiver.'Jeff Barr moves
to Salter’s safety slot and Dave
Dibbley moves from prowler to
defensive halfback. George Prib-
blish will become the new prow-
ler.

Offensively, Gary Cramer
moves from the number two tail-
back spot to Brown’s starting full-
back spot. The return of split
tackle Ed Whittaker should help
bolster the offensive line. At the
moment the status of wingback
Joe McCain looks doubtful for
Saturday, and J. D. Lewiswill
probably start if he can shake off

' a foot injury.

One of the few players that
Hart has had praise for has been
tight tackle Art Alois. “Art has
developed into quite a proficient
football player and a real team
leader,” said Hart. In last Satur-
day’s game Alois was credited
with recovering three of Pitt's
six fumbles. ~

In order to get onto the win-
ning road Hart feels that, “We’ve
got to pick ourselves up as never
before, and have to fight this
thing, this snakebite. as hard as

we canf’ ’ ‘_ .

Randy Dry Sees Break through,
Confident Soccermen Will Score

by ED CONLEY

Randy Dry is part of the soccer team’s for-

ward line that has yet to put a goal on the
scoreboard. He insists, however,‘ that the scor-
ing will come.

The varsity booters have gone down to defeat
via two successive shut-outs, and. are Just about fed
up.

“I think we’re gonna go out and get goals. We’re
tired of losing,” the sophomore from West Lawn,
Pa., says.

Dry doesn’t just say that the goals.will come,
because the players want them to, he thinks he sees
a breakthrough.

“I think we had the chances, and we’re able. It’s
just the breaks of the game, and our shots didn’t go
in,” the lineman mentions.

He adds, “We do need more shooting and more

-work together.”

The inexperience of the forwards has hurt in the
early part of the season. Theexpected mistakes
have been made and the opposition, particularly
the strong West Chester team, has taken advantage.

terior lineman has been the great difficulty the
squad has had with passes near the opposition’s
goal.

“Either we don’t get it out to them (the wings)

or they don’t get it in to us. It’s been hard playing
against those two teams,” Dry comments.

He doesn’t think that all of the blame for the
showing thus far should go to the line, though.

“The ball was up in the air too much, Saturday.
The whole team has to work on shorter passes,” he
states.

The West Chester squad used this mistake tre-
mendously; they had a great edge in height. But,
Dry felt his teammates played a good tough game.

He says, “We don’t have the fast halfbacks, but
we do play tough. But, every once in a while the
goals got through.”

As for his own play, Dry thinks that his individ-
ual problems are similar to the team difficulties.

He mentions, “I need the experience and I have
to work on shooting.” ‘

One of the things Dry doesn’t have to work on is
also similar to the good point he makes about his
team. Randy Dry plays a tough agressive game, too.

One thing that has been frustrating to the in-

Hawks Slowed by Sunburn,

Mean ‘Hawk’ Loses Weight

by WILLIE BAXT
The voice could only be

' dimly heard over the long-dis-

tance wires, but the sentiment
rang loud and clear. Mike
“Hawk” Brourman wasn’t about
to miss the first annual Pitt News
Hawks-Hawks Alumni game, and
he was going to come in from
New York ready to break a few
backs. '

“I lost 10 pounds,” chirped the

‘Hawk, “and I’m ready to go. I’m

lean and mean.”

“It depends which way he’s
leaning,” indicated head coach
Roy “Jumpshot” Jacobs, “and if
I know the Hawk, he’ll be lean-
ing the wrong way, I’ve devised
a special two—hand touch off—tac-
kle slant that we’ll run right at
him all afternoon.”

It was still a week away, but
tempers were already flaring for
this Sunday’s grudge match. Jer-
ry “LeRoy” Gruebel was particu-
larly hot under the collar.

“I fell asleep under my sun-
lamp last night, and boy does my
neck hurt,” moaned LeRoy. “I
guess I’m doubtful for Sunday’s
opener.”

“You always were a pain in the
neck,” sniped rival coach Jay
“Flatbush” Rosenstein. “We’d
just as soon see you in there,
though. You carry the ball like a
loaf of bread, and boy do you
loaf.”

While the alumni remain bas-
ically unorganized,
boosted by the news that Bill
“Log” Cabin may also wing in
for the game.

BACK THEN

The University fielded its first
football team way back in 1890.
At that time it was still known
as the Western University of
Pennsyvlania. The first season
the squad was 1-2. Times have-
n’t changed much.
