versity Paper.

GIRLS ARE LEADING LIST

Half of Fifty Dollar Prize, -Is

Subscribed to lDate—Al1 Are’

Eligible to Compete.

There is great need in the Universi-
ty of Pittsburgh for an alma mater
song. Several attempts have been
made during the last two years to se-
cure a song suitable for this purpose.
The" Pitt Weekly has undertaken the

.task of raising a subscription to se-

cure a prize of ﬁfty dollars for the
words which will best meet this de-
mand. So large a prize will undoubt-
edly bring forth the best talent in the
Llniversity. In this competition alum-
ni, faculty, members, students and for-
mer studentsiwill be eligible.

A large part of this prize has al-
ready been raised. Every man ‘or
woman who desires to help in secur-
ing a suitable alma mater is requested
to subscribe the sum of one dollar for
this prize. The girls have shown their
loyalty and interest by donating ten
dollars to this fund. The remainder

. ‘of the sum will ‘be raised in one dollar

subscriptions. The following are the
subscribers to date:

The girls, $10.

One dollar subscriptions: G. M. P.
Baird, B. F. Ashe, John O’Conner,
Ralph E. George, F. L. Bishop, J. C.

Glee Club Practices

The~Glee and Mandolin Clubs held
their regular meeting Monday even-
ing. Mr. Hise, leader of the Glee
Club, and Mr. Cratty, leader of the
Mandolin Club, are working hard
with their men and the steady im-
provement from week to week shows
that their labors are not in vain. Man-
ager Frost, ’l3, promises a ﬁne con-
cert for this year. .

Captains Fail  
In Reporting

Many Leaders Fail To Turn in Their
Reports at Last Chapel.

Failure on the part of many of the
captains of the various teams to be
present caused the report on the new
student building fund to be incom-
plete, at the regular weekly convoca-
tion in ‘Memorial’ Hall last Wednes-
day. However, those present reported
a considerable advance in the work

over the previous week.

A large chart, containing a space

for every student engaged in the work.

was hung above the platform, and as

‘the reports were given the amount was

marked down in the proper space.
Mr. Harvey was“ in charge of the

‘meeting. He gave many suggestions

as to how the students‘ should go- to

- . Senior Girls.

 

The Pittsburgh chapter of the Col-
legiate Alumnae Association gave a
tea in honor of the senior girls of
high schools and preparatory schools
in the vicinity of Pittsburgh on Satur-
day afternoon.

A very ‘entertaining program had
been arranged. Miss Johnson of the
Association spoke on the value of a
college education for women, and
urged every young womanito take ad-
vantage of any chance that might be
offered to have a college course.

On account of the illness of Mrs.
Dr. Martin, iMiss Lehman welcomed
the members of the association and
their guests on behalf of the Uni-
versity.

After the program had been ren-
dered a very pleasant social hour was
spent. The visitors were greatly im-
pressed by the generous and courteous
treatment they received. A

Alumni Will  
Admit Students

Banquet Will Be Open To a Limited
Number of Undergraduates.

The committee in charge of the
alumni banquet has announced that
students will be admitted to this, the
most elaborate event of the anniver-
sary week, as m.any studentswho de-
sired to go had petitioned the alumni
to arrange for a student represe11ta—
tion at this banquet that the alumni
has ﬁnally decided to offer a special
rate to a limited number of under-
graduates. According to the an-
nouncement, not more than two hun-
dred students will be admitted to the
banquet at a special undergraduate
rate of three and one-half dollars (the
regular price is five dollars). As the
number of students to be admitted is
limited, the committee requests all un-

- dergraduates intending to accept this

offer to hand their names as soon as
possible to Mr. Alexander Silverman
Secretary of the Alumni Association,
or to leave their names at the Pitt
Weekly ofﬁce.

The committee in charge of the‘
banquet is planning to make it the
best ever heldiby the Alumni Asso-
ciation. Careful preparations for dec-
orating the Memorial Hall vbanquet
room, the place in which the banquet
is to be “held, have already been made.

The~comn1'ittee expects an attendance '

of from ﬁve to ten hundred guests be-
sides the undergraduates.

,CLASSICALS HOLD MUSICALE.

H1, : ‘Latin Quartette Is Feature of Meeting

of Classical Club.

A pleasing innovation in the pro-
gram of the Classical Club was the
feature of the last meeting of that or-
ganization on Friday morning. A
quartette, consisting of Messrs. Alli-
son, Baw, Coen and Porter, sang “In-
terger Vitae.” Many persons, hearing
the singing, invaded the meeting, caus-
ing an overﬂow. Those that could not
gain. admission lingered about the
doorway. _

_Next week the entire Classical Club
will take part in a musical number,
anda large crowd is anticipated.

C. D. Diamond, ‘I5, gave a very in-
teresting talk on “Recent Excavations
in Greece.” The discussion which fol-
lowed was led by Prof. Scribner an

stration during the week of the one
hundred and twenty-ﬁfth anniversary
celebraton have been turned over by

‘the executive committee to the (Stu-

dent Senate.

It is desired t'hat on one of the even-
of the celebration (probably,
Monday evening) the students give a
demonstration in the nature of a torch
light parade around Oakland, or a
demonstration of a like nature. The
matter has been taken up by the Sen-
ate, and a committee of three, con-
sisting of. L. G. Boggs, Allan and Geo.
Kirk was appointed to decide on the
nature of this demonstration. O

This committee is hard at work and
at the next meeting of the Senate a
full report, with complete plans, sub-
ject to the approval of the Senate, will
be submitted. _ -

Chancellor McCormick is extremely
anxious that aspeciﬁc demonstration
by the student body shall be given
during the celebration. He expressed
himself as being in favor of a torch
liglit parade, if it could be arranged.
However, he wanted to give the mat-
ter entirely into the hands of the Sen-
ate to decide.

It is conﬁdently expected that a
completed program for the one hun-
dred and twenty—ﬁ’ftl1 celebration of
the University of Pittsburgh will be
ready for publication in the next issue
of the Weekly.

At the last meeting of the Owl

signed from that capacity. Owing to
a lack of a quorum a new business
manager was not elected. A new busi-
ness manager will be elected at the

is progressing favorably.
ston has been awarded the contract
for all-photographic work for the Owl

upon condition that all work be ﬁr1—'

ished by February 20. The engraving

board editors, when interviewed by a
Pitt VVeekly reporter, stated that all
junior pictures must be taken and O.
K.’d within three weeks from date.
otherwise -their pictures will not ap-
pear in the Owl; also that all organ-
izations must arrange to have their

fore he had remarked that he was be-
ginning to feel like his former self
and shortly would resume his prac-
tice. He had -be-en suffering from or-
ganic heart trouble for several months
and this is given» as the"cause of his
sudden death. Life‘ already was ex-
tinct when Dr. Hitzrot was carried t-o
the office of Dr. H{ S. Nicholson, at
No. 1612 Shady avenue. Dr. Hitzrot
was one of the most widely known
German physicians in Allegheny coun-

He engaged

graduated with honors. A short time
later he decided to study medicine and
entered the medical department of
Western University, graduating with
the class of ’89. Later Dr. Hitzrot
succeeded his brother in business, at

September, when he was compelled to
retire temporarily on account of ill

health. Dr. Hi-tzrot was married in

PROFESSOR WRITES ARTICLE

Mr. Harris’ Experiments on .Wire-
less Telegraph Apparatus-—Are De-
scribed in “Electrical World.”

An article by Mr. L. H. Harris on
“Wireless Telegraph Apparatus” ap-
peared in the December 30 edition of
the “Electrical World.” The article
was of extreme interest to students
and anyone interest-ed in electrical ap-
paratus. The experiments described
in the article were conducted, in the
University laboratories. The results
obtained demonstrate the complete-
ness of equipment in the laboratories,
and the ability of- Mr. Harris in elec-
trical work. The gist of the article
was the description of a series o.f tests
made to determine the difference be-
tween the operating characteristics of
various types of wireless telegraph
detectors, and to establish if possible
whether or not there was a basic dif-
ference in «this mode of operation.

As a direct result of this paper in-
fringement claims in an "important pat-
ent litigation were refuted. We con-
gratulate Mr. Harris on the success of
his experiment. : '

the Musical Clubs have been requested

to holda joint entertainment with the
Cap and Gown Club. In order to
make the best possible showing, the
clubs have determined to call for more
candidates. Owing to the examina-

tions in theother departments and to.

the dropping of several members of
the club on account -of absence from
school, several positionsin the musical
clubs havelbecome vacant. It is of the
utmost necessity that many candidates’
for the vacant places report w.ithin the
near future. To secure the proper
training’ for the men who will ﬁll these
positions, -they must be chosen very
sh-ortly. A large number of candidates
should‘ respond" to this call.

The call for candidates by the Mu-
sical Clubs calls attention likewise to
the fact that more men are needed to
take the many positions inothe play
“The Vision of She-Who-Knows,” the
University play which is to be given
on one of the nights of the anniver-
sary week." The next meeting of those
interested in this play will be held
this afternoon. The -committee in
charge states that fully seventy per-
sons will be needed to complete the
cast. The parts require but little pre-
vious training, being very -easy. The
play consists largely in tableaux; con-
sequently many participants will not
be required 'to speak. Of the seventy
persons needed, at least twenty must
be girls.‘ Every effort should be made
to secure the full number needed at
this first rehearsal.

AN ALIVIA MATER.

As announced elsewhere in this
issue a prize of ﬁfty dollars is now be-
ing collected by The Pitt Weekly to
offer for the best words submitted for
an Alma Mater song. We urge every
student, professor, alumnus or former
student with the least amount -of po-
etic ability to compete for this prize.
Whether you win or not, you will be
aiding your University to secure the
much—needed song. The more that com-
pete, the better the ﬁnal result will be,
We trust that all will start work im-
mediately upon this song. The winner
-of the prize must submita work which
will become representative of Pitt. To
start early will give the? competitor
more -time to plan the details of his
poem, to devote more energy to writ-
ing a song of which the University
may be proud. And, remember, -that
aside from the prize, the successful
candidate will be remembered as long
as the University of'Pittsburgh~ stands
through his work in writingan Alma
Mater to be sung by many?‘ fu-ture

THE ,s"'rU“D’E1<I"r SENATE.

Much criticism has been called
foith by the supposed negligence of
the Student Senate during the past
year. But these critics of the senate
‘forget that the senate has had prac-
tically no chance to perform its
duties. With classes held at the -only
hours at which -it is possible to meet,
with all the available rooms in all the
buildings of the Uncversity occupied
by classes, with cuts charged against
"hours at which it is possible to meet,
ing during a class hour, with several
different organizations meeting at the
same time, it is well nigh impossible
for this student organization‘ to per-
form any’ of its -duties. Some allow-

tions by these critics before they pro-
ceed to attack men, some of whom at
least try to fulﬁll .the duties of their
positions.

Oh You Freshman Banquet!
13 present. 1
That’s better than none.

A little more enthusiasm on the
part of the Student Body in regand to
basketball would, no doubt, do much
towards a successful season.

Has Pitt a CheeriLeader? If so, a
little publicity would not go amiss.

 

Conditions are now all that could be
desired at the basketball games, but
the result‘is far from satisf.actory.
Would some one kindly offer a sug-
gestion that might help?

Can you imagine what it feels like
to be one hundred and twenty—ﬁve
years old? I cannot conceive the sen-
sation,‘bnt I surmise one would be
more or less rusty after existing that
length of time. There is.a certain
-book that tells of one austere gentle-
man who attained the frivolous age of
ninehundred odd years. That sure-
ly would be a long time to be mar-
ried! But that isn’t the story Iiwant
to tell——just‘ now. '

In three weeks or more this Uni-
versity is going to celebrate its one
hundred and twenty-ﬁfth anniversary.
Now, as 1‘. strict matter of fact, that
ripe old age is a mere matter of fancy
—a tolerably fair theme for poetry
and chapel speakers, but as an actual
epoch in the pages of history it is de-
cidedly nil.

' An institution having behind it one
hiindred and twenty-ﬁve years of real
life must have venerable buildings
dedicated in the achievements of men;
a ’distinguished faculty grown grey in
the service of education; traditions
and “character revered ‘in the eyes of

a person in an endeavor to get a sub-

scription to the fund. He suggested
that two men might work together, in
order that if one should overlook any
argument the other‘would think of it.

Chancellor McCormick made a few
very pointed remarks about the num-
ber of men who were not attending
the weekly meetings.

“Any man,” said the Chancellor"

“who stays awayfrom any of these

gatherings, especially now, is not do-

ing right by his University, to say the
least.

“Last week there were at least 100
students in and about Thaw and State
halls -during the chapel service. Every-
-one of these men should have be_en at
the meeting. I cannot express too
strongly how important it is for every
man to be in. his place at these
Wednesday morning gatherings. Cer-
tainly at the -present time, just in the
midst of this campaign for the stu-
d-~nt building, no man, unless he has
a very good excuse, can afford to be
absent.” ,

One of the announcements of the
morning caused a ripple of laughter.
It was to this effect: The Freshmen
basketball team would play Pittsburgh
H. S. on the H. S. floor Friday after-
noon. After the game there would be
a dance, the admission to both‘ func-
tions being the ’l.arg.e sum -of ten (10)

' cents.

Editor Pitt Weekly:

Dear Si.,r_:-,——In, conjunction, with a
letter that was published in the
Weekly’s last issu-e I am writing this
asi,a suggestion tothe men in charge
of athletics at Pitt. This is not writ-
ten w-ith/,,refe.rence to any person, but
to’-a system. ‘My suggestion is this:
That all freshman teams be put in the
hands of the Athletic Committee or
some one thoroughly acquainted with
the importance of those teams. In
past. years the teams have been run
loosely with no regard to them by
anyone. save the players. They .~ha.v,e
been merely shadows of an institution
thatnm-ight be potent and, thriving.
T-hey have been, losing teams -and
have, as a rule, been made up of as
many upper classmen as fresh. Here
is a ﬁeld where honorﬁmight ‘be ac-
corded the University but which at
present is rather a dishonor.

There are several reasons why I
developed. First, a stronger. team
a phas-eof ‘school life for the—_.fresh-
man, a great majority of the
would turn out for them. Second,
with a better team developed, a
schedule of goodgames might/be_ ar-
ranged. This would add interest and
vim to the athletic spinit. ' Who of us
would not go to see W. & I., Tech,
Westminster, Allegheny or State
frcs‘hmen play our boys? With a good
schedule arranged for the incoming
class it would arouse them to their
duty in athletics and thereby promote
school spirit. A
i This manner of bringing. out the
athletes would inevitably discover
’varsity material before unheard of,
and which would never unearth itself
were it not for t'his manner‘ of devel-
opment. .

There are various other advantages
Ealso that would be found in having
lthe arrangements for freshmen teams’
icompleted by those familiar with the
lprocess, but I will not mention them
lnow. Theseare sufficient to let you

jsee what it needed, I would suggest
l~therefore, that a committee of one
‘man (Mr. Miller, for example) should
be appointed by the Athletic Commit-
iitee to take charge of all freshman
iteams in the future and arrange all
details for games, etc. We could
thereby instead of placing the em-
bryo student in the forge and labora-
tory all day long, give him some of
the development which mak-es for love
of the Alma Mater.

If such ‘a course is already contem-
plated by the authorities when the
new gym is erected, I commend them
highly for it, as all others no doubt
will. Sincerely yours,

A Student. ,

  At Basketball Games

No Cheering Causes Pitt to

Lose Game to, Juniata _—.

Game. _ .

The defeat last Friday -night may

‘ be charged ‘in pan t‘o"uae 'fa'c't"'that

there was a decided lack of spirit by

4 the Pi-tt supporters, and this may be
laid at the door of the cheer leaders.

While it is not the policy of the

. sporting department to V“knock,” we

feel that a criticism‘ is necessary at
this time. Our cheering at the foot-

W ball games was splendid and much

praise reverted justly to the men w-ho

_led the cheering .and to the Pitt band’.
’ . The basketball teamv is ﬁghting for

the Gold and Blue of old Pittsburgh
the same as -the. football team did in
the fall, and deservestthe same loyal

‘support from the student body. The

P.. A. A. gymnasium was well
crowded with Pitt supporters who
would have made the club house ring
with Pitt cheers except for the fact

ﬁthiatithere was no cheer leader pres-

ent. “Bobby” Groves led a cheer just
before the game ended and did very
well for one who lacked experience
that particular line, but there
should have been no necessity to call
on him. The loss of the game might

 be directly charged to the lack of
 1, cheering. -

Western Reserve University will be
played Friday next at the P. A. A.

_. and it \is up to the cheer leaders to

show the visitors what real Pitt spirit

1 is and not have them go back to

Cleveland with the idea that we are
lacking in that respect. -

g According to rumors from W. & J.

‘they contemplate holding an indoor
hmeet early in April, to which they

will invite Pitt, Westminster and
Tech.‘ They claim to have lots of

_ -good track material and will make it
hot for all their rivals this year. The

indoor track at Washington is said
to be a good one and such a meet
should they decide t-o hold it would
prove both close and interesting.

W. & J., like Pitt, made a miserable
showing at the Penn relay games in
Philadelphia last spring, but think

they will be able to win in their class

this year. They expect to be repre-

sented at Pitt’s seventh annual inter-

collegiate and interscholastic track
and ﬁeld meet to be held May 25th.

Few Former College Baseball Men

Make Good With Big Leagues.

It is an. acknowledged fact that col-
lege baseball is anything but a suc-
cess and as a proof-of this statement
it is only necessary to scan the list
of “big leaguers’.’ and note how few
were formericollege stars. There are
several_reas-onswhy college teams are
weak and the most prominent one is
that the college baseball season lasts
only from the middle of April till the
last of May. When the college sea-
son is over the big league teams have
just started the long grind of their
six months playingyear and are just
beginning to perfect team w-ork and
“inside” plays. 3

“Dick” Hoblitzell, who won his let-

ter_at Pitt in ’07, was drafted by the
Cincinnati Reds soon after his gradu-
ation and ‘has made good with a ven-
geance. He is said to rank close up
to Chance of the Cubs and Koney of
the Cards in ability, and if the Pirates
had been able to secure his services
last year they would probably have
ﬁnished many points nearer ﬁrst
place. _ _
' Christy Mathewson, who is proba-
bly- the greatest pitcher of them all
is a product .of Brown University. Vin
Campbell, the ﬂeet footed Pirate out-
ﬁelder, attended Smith Academy in St.
Louis and later Washington Univer_si-
ty in the same city. Eddie Collins,
who has factored prominently in two
world’s championships, won his letter
in track at Columbia University, and
after his graduation took up the na-
tional game. There are, perhaps, a
host of other college men who have
won theiriilaurels in the ‘big leagues
but their number is very small com-
pared to the great number in the
Class A ranks.

The only actual comparison which
we have between college and league
ball is the annual game ‘between Yale
and the New York Giants. The for-
mer team ranks high in college cir-
cles, but is downe-d each year by Mc-
Graw’s nine with comparative ease.

TECHITES DEFEAl JUNIATA

After Juniata had successfully in-
vaded Pitt’s, camp and carried away
the honors, 34-33, t'hey decided to
take a fall out of our ne-ar neighbors.
Carnegie Tech,‘ but were doomed to
defeat as the Plaid boys copped the
game‘ 24-21. This will give the Pitt
supporters an idea of just what they
are up "against a few weeks hence
when the Techites will hook up with
Pitt at the new gymnasium.

There’s -only one course for us to
take, work hard and pull for the team
during the intervening games. This
will give us victory! Bigler, the
Juniata forward, who thr-ew.l2 out of
13 fouls in’ our game, was away off
color when Tech was played, as he
was only able to toss 7 out of 18 into

. the ‘basket.

Listless Game Last Saturday
Evening—-"Will -do Better.

In an exciting game of basketball
at the P. A. A.clubhouse Friday night
the ﬁv-e from Juniata College w-on a
hard earned victory 34-33. The game
was close during the entire distance
and with but one minute of play left
Pitt had a lead of three p-oints, but
two ﬁeld goals by Bigler put -his team
one point to the good when the
whistle blew. Juniata started out

with a four point lead, but by the endr

of the ﬁrst half i-tt had gradually cut
down the lead to 25 all. When the
second half was half over Pitt had a
comfortable lead of 7 points,-but
Juniata came up from be'hind and
managed to win.

Bigler, the Juniata forward, is re-
sponsible for Pitt’s ‘defeat, .as he

scored 17 points fromrthe ﬁeld and 12’

out of 13 foul goals, which made his
total 24 points. If he had done even
half as well against Tech his team
would have won the game. ,

McDowell lan-ded 7 ﬁeld goals and
put up a good defensive game. Capt.
Campbell also played a star game at
guard, but was unable to toss any ﬁeld
goals. Brady, -who replaced. McDowell
at center, did well for hisiiﬁrst game,
but was nervous most of the game. He
will undoubtedly improve with exper-
ience.

Frishman did not start the game
owing to a recent injury, but was put
at forward in the last part of the sec-
ond half and scored two ﬁeld -goals.
Broido, H. Campbell and Graham did
well for Pitt.

 BENNER WRITES ARTICLE.

Dr. R. C. Benner of the ‘Depart-
ment of Industrial Research of the
University, recently published an an
ticle in the Pittsburgh Gazette—Times
on the “Smoke Nuisance.” He proved

uthat’ the impure air degenerates and

also that the city may be clean. He
showed’ that the soot particles

spreckle the ‘best fruit of the region
and is vastly injurious to the apple
-V crop. Hope for abatement

of the
nuisance is based on public spirited
citizens. Until this is done, he said

_‘the city cannot attain its due measure

of - growth and prosperity.’

The Mining School has been sup
'plieud with a power hack saw f.or cut-
lting metal. Keep the good work up.

l Prof. Zurn of the Mining School is
larranging some problems for "Coal
land Coke Operator,” a mining engi-

ineering journal of Pittsburgh.

 

Dr. S. W. Stratton, Director of Bu-
reau of Standards,‘ at Washington,
spent last Thursday at the University.
He made a thorough investigation of
lthe apparatus and the facilities and
was apparently much pleased.

 

Prof. Roseneaus, who lectured last
evening on the Sanitary Commission
in Thaw Hall, was banqueted by the
faculty at 6 o’clock in the University

Club. Those present were members
of the Medicine and Engineering
Schools.

. Acting on the request of -those in
charge of the play, the Senate has
taken up the matter of getting men
out for positions in the cast. A com-
mittee was appointed to get at least
fifteen men out ﬁor the speaking parts‘
and about ﬁfty for the'table‘auxpchar-
acters. 

’l‘hose persons who are running the
play are very anxious to have a large
number of candidates come out this
week. The time is short between now.
and the giving of the play, making es-
sential that the cast be selected and
practice started just as soon as pos-
sible.
