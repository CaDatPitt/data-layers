men who crowd into Memorial Hall today, the last
for those of us who in the Fall of 1930 sat in the same

lfteried‘ college to remain’ here during years in which the
political, social, and economic‘ structures of America and
ofthe world have been considerably altered.

“Camping” Orientation

' HIS WEEK-END sees-the third of the now Well-
established YMCA Freshman Camp Conferences which
take place annually at Camp Kori-O-Kwee. '1‘hree,.years
ago some skepticism arose as to the practicability’ of I
Jthe proposed camp and it took the leadership of John
B, Hblbrook to inaugurate the camp and to make it a

success every year. » . ‘
That the ‘Freshman Caniphas deﬁnite. orientation fa-
cilities andadvantages is not to» be doubted. Freshmen
Can m8e.t‘_profninent faculty -people, leaders instudent

activities,Land can get something of an idea concerning ,

-why they are coming to college. This latter acquisition.
depends on the particular student. Certainly the mate-
rials for a. valuable pre-education forcampus life are‘
abundant ' ‘ ‘ ‘ - -

With its ‘unlimited advantages for -the Freshman stu-

dent the LCamp_has-‘certain inherent dangers, which. .,a1- .

though they have not yet during the past three years.

the camp feels that his attendance there gives him spe-
cial privilege, places him above his fe-llow students, sim-
ply because he met andltalked with some ‘campus lead.
ers, the boy is mistaken. Secondly} ‘seventy-five out of '
the-‘entire group of freshman men is the limit for which
th'e.f-acilities of Kon-O-Kwee are prepared. , That is too
small a number. It centers the-reorientation ‘around too
select an-group deprivingmost of the members

Three years of Camp experience should have’ made’
Holbrook and his aides expert in the advantages and
disadvantages .of such an event. Certainly the Univer-

sity students and the Pitt News would be interested in "

learning. from~these men how, in the future, thecamp
can be made to include more of the freshman class,’how

L it can be improved to mean as. much in the future to '

freshmen as it ‘has. during the past two years. The Pitt

 ~ ’ F The"ﬁr§t dues-tion in the mind of‘ anyone who really takes an interest in
wtiatfsgoing son-is the. condition of the 1933 edition of the Pitt football team.

Hdwever,  taking the squad apart and ﬁnding fault, it might do’-well‘ to

,_§ofiino ‘somewhat of a strange interlude on this column, the Campus’ Scout.

,  For several years, barring last" year's omission, the Campus Scout
 »?‘3~has functioned as the ofﬁcialvstudent sports organ ofthe University.

~—-However, it also became well known for its ability to start an ar-
gument, cause trouble and in general, done one a.ny good. ‘It must
‘be’ admitted thatthe ,column was read, for the most part,_ by those

_ ‘ seeking to ﬁnd an excuse to write a letter to the. boss and demand
‘I the reason why such crack bralned individuals were allowed near_a-
 newspaper office. Perhaps last year’s omission of the Campus Scout
was merely an attempt _to placate quite a few radically minded stu-
dents withthoughts of tar ahd feathers uppermost in their minds.

It is with much regret that we promise to live up to the —motto_ of our -

- Apredecessorof 1931, namely to print the truth,-print it‘ while still
.news, and not to retract any statements unless we can be shown
deﬁnitely where there is error. Needless to mention, the “we” is"

, , merely .a ﬁgure of speech. (But if anyone does get tough it will be
‘ A -é‘ha.n’ged_to' read"‘gang’?!) - _ _ .

Y i 5  Ever since Jock Sutherland took charge in 1924, after

the departure of Pop Warner,‘ the skeptics '-‘have hailed
 the beginning of each season as an. excuse to start the
anvil chorus moving and to -announce to the country at

, large that Pitt‘ lost too n‘~.a.ny stars by graduation the

preceding June to have anygchance to. win even ‘one

game this year. For some unexp_lained reason, the Pan-
thers have'a1ways managed towin one game. a season,
and have ‘astounded their followers by‘ ‘winning more
than one, on occasion. This year, when Pitt fans reaized
that Heller, Dailey, Tormey, Reider, Cuba, and’company.
had graduated. _the Bronx bellows were renewed. Before
