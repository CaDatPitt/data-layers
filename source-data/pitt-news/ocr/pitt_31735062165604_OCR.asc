The Pitt News sports editor Jim O’Brien has swept all
major awards for sports writing in a nationwide collegiate

journalism contest.

Pi Delta Epsilon, national honorary fraternity for col-
legiate journalists, awarded O’Brien first, second, and third
place honors in sports writing, two honorable mentions, and

third ‘prize_ in feature writing.
The awards were announced at
Pi Delta Epsi1on’s initiation ban-
quet on November 7 at the Pitts-
burgh Press Club. At the banquet
13 new members were initiated.

Secretary Awarded

Edward McDonald, n a t i o n al
grand secretary of Pi Delta Ep-
silon,_gave O’Brien an inscribed
bronze letter opener for each win-
ning entry and award money that
totalled $70.

McDonald said that, to his
knowledge, no student had ever
taken all awards in a single
ﬁeld as O’Brien had done in
sports.

Coincidentally, O ’Brie n was
chairman for the banquet.

Related Experiences

Sportscaster Jack Henry, who
told Pi Delt members of _some of
his experiences in the newspaper
ﬁeld, was the subject of “Oh
Henry,” O’Brien’s feature story
that won third place. \

First place in sports writing

went to “Marshall Goldberg —
Act II,” an appraisal of a foot-
ball squad member whose father
was an All-American at the
University. A story on hatchet-
man” Pete Billey, “What Makes
Billey Run,’_’ won second prize,
whi_le “Astronaut Moore,” which
discussed Duquesne’s ex-bask-
etball coach, Dudey Moore. W011
third prize. , .

O’Brien coverage of the Pan-
thers’ win over Navy and their
loss to Syracuse were given hon-
orable mention.

The awards were given for
articles published during the
1961-62 school year. Approximate-
ly 100 colleges throughout the
United States have chapters for
Pi Delta Epsilon.

mester on The Pitt News; O’Brien

, What will more than likely be the last official words,
V .‘ ever said about the charges which Professor Lawrence Lee
i hurled at the University Faculty Senate were reported at
that organization’s meeting last week. Some of the words
in the report, however, spark a demand for further com-
' ment. ' T
A An important part of the_ investigating committee’s
report, for example, ‘reads, “Each of the issues he (Lee)
raised has been reduced essentially to divergent under-
  standings, hurt feelings, reasonable human failures or
A .goals out of_harmony with institutional objectives.”_ -
 The first three of these levels to which the‘ charges
A. ' have been reduced are readily acceptable. Just what “goals
’ out of harmony with institutional objectives” arebeing
harbored here, however, opens aiwide area for conjecture.
As the life-blood of the University with speciﬁcally deﬁned ‘
- goals of their own, the students should be greatly concerned
about the goals of their school. Accordingly, ifmembers of
the University faculty are aiming for goals other’ than those
of the institution as a whole, it is the students’ undeniable
right to be informedof them.
9 But students had no part in the Investigation; of aca.
- “ demic integrity at the University. No student or‘ group of-
students, to our knowledge, was .given the opportunity to
‘reveal opinion on the highly controversial subject. No stu-
dent was allowed to attend the Faculty Senate ‘meeting to
hear the committee’s report on the commentary on it. In '
’ the same vein, students could not receive any impressions

 

 

the official public relations office report. V ' _.
_ Students should also-be interested to note that the re-
 - port adds that “in the context of the. search for truth, Pro-
‘ fessor Lee has the perogative, perhaps the, resppnsibgty,
to express aloud his convictions.” ' . V t ' “
 That any member of the University community.— fac- *
ulty member or student — should have this perogative “in
the search for truth” should not even have to be brought up.
But that a member “perhaps” should consider this his re-
" sponsibility? Should there, indeed‘, be any question about
such responsibility. There obviously "is in the ‘mind of
several people on this campus. '

The crux of the matter is that we have seen one level
of the University investigate and report on a problem
-which involved all levels of the University. The rather
vague fruits of this labor are unsatisfying. We had hoped
for a more complete harvest. _

Winner

 

  

 

‘By Matthew Nesvisky

A few weeks ago John Steinbeck turned on his
television set to hear the latest news about the
Cuban situation and learned, along_ with the rest of
America. that he had been awarded the Nobel
Prize for literature.

The recently-bearded novel-.
ist, although dreading the sudden '
publicity yvhich the announce-'
ment would bring him and re-
grettingithe fact that he would
have to make a “fancy public
speech” when he accepted the
prize, was still probably quite,
pleased with the news. And
surely many of his. admirers
were. ,

But many greeted the an- ’
nouncementrof the winner of the most coveted
literary prize in the world with strong reserve, even
protest. Certain critics had suspiciously little to
say about the matter. One newsmagazine apparent-
ly ignored the issue. Several collegiate newspapers
from various parts‘ of the country -polled their
English departments and received a great deal of
restrained praise for the choice. Pipe-chomping
graduate students with writer’s cramp have openly
decried the selection here at the University and the

 

most respected writer/writing teacher in our Eng-I.‘
lish department recently summed up his view of

the matter with these words: ’
“I think the American most deserving of the

. Prize is Robert Frost, but the selection of Steinbeck

'— well, it’s no disgrace. I only wish they’d given
it torhim before his last novel camevoutf’, A
Sliahtly Discontent ‘

Okay, so The Winter of Our Discontent was far
from being Steinbec'k’s best effort; it was still" a

literary mile ahead of almost everything else that _

was published last year. But to pass offihis receiv-
ing the Nobel Prize as merely being “no disgrace!”
Well, that got my dander up, whatever the hell
Ithat=mean‘s. ' '

author. on the basis of the bulk of his life’s work,
not for any individual book. The bulk of Stein-

beck’s work, as one can see‘ by noting the jacket I

blurbs on his latest -books, is almost invariably re-.

ferred to as The Grapes of Wrath, dEtc. Unques-
tionably, Grapes is the author’s best—known novel,
but it appears that only the Nobel people are really
concerned about what that “Etc.” stands for.

To me, that abbreviation stands -for allifetime

light. _ . , ' ..

of work far superior to that of the two latest E
American Nobel Prize-winner; namely, William
Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway A quick '
glance at only a few of ,Steinb,eck’s ~lesser-kno\vn ‘
novels can illustrate this point. ‘ §
His very. short novel, The Moon Is Down, de— 
scribed a quiet bit of heroism on the part of a

denly caught up in a war. lt_ is told in aiquiet,
simple manner, but manages to say more about war
and the general nature of man than any of Hem-_
ingway’s much lengthier metaphysical masturba-
tion fantasies about bridge—bombings and ambu-
lance races ever did,

Another shortie, The Pearl, was published sev-
eral years before the Great White Hunter’s -novel,
The Old Man and the Sea, but“ although it was
written with a similar approach to style, ‘symbol-
ism, structure and theme, it never achieved the“:
acclaim of Hemingway’s book, probably because ’,
Steinbeck didn’t bother to toss in the tid-bits to 1
tantalize the intellectuals.

poem about man’s relationship to the land he.lives
oﬁ .of exhibits an unmatched’ tirnelessness and uni—,
versality and will probably be remembered in the
future as the author’s best all-around effort. . , .:

All of these personal evaluations indicate at
least ‘one thing: John Steinbeck, although con-
sidered ;a great stylist andhumanitarian by the
Nobel committee andllittle old me, is clearly not ‘an'

By NANCY FUCHS
, 313 SU was dark and silent. Suddenly — life and light!
The Huntsmen were arriving. Entering several at a time and
calling jovial greetings, their presence ﬁlled the entire room.
One of -them played a soft melody on the old upright,
anotherlicked a chocolate ice cream cone while an envious

lfellow Huntsman said, “Why

didn’t I think of that?” and

still another played “hot potato”¢

with a hot light bulb.

When all eight Ijluntsmen, the
University’s popular singing
group, arrived, they stopped their
antics to answer some questions
about themselves. Their spokes-

‘ man,‘ Pete Bijur, did most. of the

talking, but everyone put in his
“two cents worth.” - ‘
Organized by Andrews T

According‘ to the Huntsmen,
their singing group was organized
by Bill Andrews, who had studied
at Cornell and had become inter-
ested in student singing. groups
there.

He felt that our University
needed’ 'a singing group too,,sp -
he and others who had a mu-’
tual love for music joined voices-
under thename of the Hunts-
men. Their theme ‘song with
which they end each perform-
ance was added later. _

The present members are: sen-
iors, Jim Toth and Terry Reese;
juniors, Pete Bijur,‘Curt Ebitz
and Joe Sieger, and sophomores,
Dave Reese, Jim Sayre, and Alan
Wakelin.

Their majors range from pre-
Law and , political science to

, mathematics and engineering, but

their common interest, singing,
binds them into a closely-knit
group. Their friendship extends
beyond singing together.

Curt Ebitz, who was one of
the ﬁrst Huntsmen, calls him-
self “the last of the originals.”
The three sophomores joined
last spring.

“-We practice twice a week in
two hour rehearsals,” Bijur ‘said.
“And we’re versatile,” chimed in
a fellow member. “I bowl too!”-

Besides singing at all kinds of
University functions, they have
performed .at colleges such as
Washington and Jeﬁerson, the
Hilton Hotel and many other
places in Pittsburgh, as well as
CBS-TV. In the spring, they have
a singing engagement in New Jer-
sey and possibly Washington, D.C.

‘When asked what they would
call the kind of music they sing,

- cries of “collegiate” and “mod-

ern harmonizations of old tunes”
arose. They ﬁnally agreed on
calling. it “modern collegiate
harmony” or as one Huntsman
commented, “whatever that
means.”

An r impromptu singing of
“Happy Birthday” to Wakelin was
followed by Dave Reese passing
around his hat with the plea,
“Present for Alan!”

Then their fun stopped as
suddenly as it ‘began and they
went to work immediately. The
song, “Lida Rose,” filledthe air.
Then came self-criticism—“The
‘ﬁrst parf isn’t quite right.”

“Yeah, we missed that note.”
“Lida Rose” again. After more
favorable comments like, “That

wasn’t_ too bad,” the strains of.

“Yellow Bird” filled the small
room and, as the door was opened,
ﬂoated down the hall . . .

The Huntsmen’s dedication of
the song, “Persian Kitten,” to Dr.
Alan C. Rankin, assistant chancel-
lor for student and general aﬁairs,
which has been a subject of great
conjecture among University stu-
dents, was put before Bijur.
“That’s a big, dark secret!” was
his only comment.

Midday Speaker Tells
Of New Latin America

 /%/ // ?

      

    
 

 

AT COFFEE HOUR, following his Midday address, Dr. Mario
Amadeo discusses Latin American politics with audience. Seated
to Dr. Amadeo’s right is C. Scott Kelly, assistant director of the
Office of Cultural and Educational Exchange.

By ROSITA WHITMAN

Latin America no longer constitutes a passive object, but
a subject of interest _in world tension according to Dr. Mario
Amadeo, former United Nations delegate from Argentina and
present Foreign Minister to the United States, who spoke a
the Midday Series Lecture on November 7. -

Although the focus of his talk was to have centered on

the Alliance for Progress and the
signiﬁcant steps being brought
about in Latin America through
the program, Amadeo stressed the

problems of Latin America’s
transformation and their ﬁght for
political, social and economic
 EIE|'S' M.E.'S' A.E..Sg
“The Castro challenge has PHYSICISTS 8‘
shown in a dramatic way that MATHEMA-HCIANS‘

Latin America is going through a
great transformation t h r o u g h
many factors,” said Amadeo. This
remark contradicted a further
one," “The Castro-Communist re-
sponse in trying to convey the
message of liberation on the basis
of Marxist doctrine has failed.”

Amadeo Explained

Amadeo explained the “why”
for Latin America’s sudden emer-
gence with two points. The first
point is the loss of prestige of the
aristocratic classes in economic
and social inﬁuence—the basis for
political power.

“The masses emerged to pow-
er and embraced the idea of the
French revolution," Amadeo ex-
plained. The second point is
that the sheer sentiment of the
inequality of the masses and
the lack of the capacity of the
economic structure to provide
a higher standard of living pro-
vides this feeling of unrest
among the masses.

“These two problems demand
two responses to the main ele-
ments of political revolution and
social unrest to the nonconform-
ity to the law,” stated Amadeo.

Latin Reaction
“First,” he continued, “The re-
action of the Latin American
masses is that the majority of
them realize that the message of
Cuba will not provide them with
a suitable system of political,
economic and social reform.”
“The second response is the
Nationalistic M a r x is t Move-
ments that do not claim allegi-
ance to the Soviet Bloc but to
the symbols of their country.
This masked movement obscures
the real nature of the move-
ment through their nationalis-
tic symbols.

Finally, 'Amadeo declared that
the Alliance for Progress is a
possible solution to create an at-
mosphere of freer understanding
between our two cultures.

“It is not a system of aid ex-
clusively but a program designed
for economic and social reform
through the economic develop-
ment of natural resources in each
country under the supervision of
the Organization of American
States.”

Jonas Discusses

Poet’s Work

By MIKE MARCUSE

Dr. Klaus W. Jonas, associate
professor of German at the Uni-
versity, left for Cologne, Ger-
many, last Friday, to participate in
the Third International Sympo-
sium on Gerhart Hauptmann, Ger-

-many’s Nobel Prize-winning poet.

Jonas received the invitation to
join the symposium last June be-
cause of a research project he has
been preparing on Hauptmann’s
works.

The invitation came from the

German Academic Exchange .
Service in Bonn, Germany. The i
V.,'\*’ service is an organ of the West '3

German Government.
German Universities .
Jonas will be spending 17 days

in Germany, although the sym— '

posium will last only ﬁve days.
The other 12 days will be spent
visiting various German univer-
sities including. Bonn, ‘Cologne,
Munich, Hamburg, and the Free
University of West Berlin.

For the past few years, Jonas
has been working with the
United States Educational Com-
mission in Bonn, Germany,
helping to provide for the ex-
change of students and profes-
sors between the‘ U.S. and West
Germany.

When asked who he will be
visiting while in Germany, he re-
plied, “I’ll be trying to visit my

‘ many friends who used to teach

here at the University and who
have returned to German schools.”
Studying Hauptmann

For a number of years Jonas
has been studying the work of
Gerhart Hauptmann. At present
he is trying to gather together all
of Hauptmann’s manuscripts

Fall Meeting of Graduate

Faculty Set for Friday

The fall meeting of the Grad-
uate Faculty will be held on Fri-
day at 3 p.m. in 324 CL._The
meeting will be devoted to a con-
sideration of ways in which stu-
dent progress through_ their doc-
toral programs might be expe-
dited.

 

 University German Professor
Attends German Symposium

 

DR. KLAUS W. JONAS

"Hauptmann Researcher

which are presently in the posses-
sion of many people, throughout
the world.

He has traveled extensively,
collecting and editing letters,
drafts of poems, and other
manuscripts. This summer he
spent some time as a guest of
Dr. Benevenuto Hauptmann, the

  
 

poet’s son and literary executor. ,
Jonas worked in his archive at
Ronco, Switzerland.
“Hauptmann,” a c c o r din g to
Jonas, “is one of Germany’s lead-
ing dramatists and one of the
heads of the German naturalist
movement.” Jonas is interested in
Hauptmann not only because of
his literary stature, but because
Hauptmann has had a very close
relationship with th e United
States.

Toured America
In 1932 Hauptmann spent six
weeks touring America as the
guest of Columbia University.

‘Columbia also presented him with

an honorary degree. He received
a second honoraryfrom Harvard
University and was presented to
President Hoover as part of his
visit.

Jonas intends to collect all of
"Hauptmann’s manuscripts and
then hopes ‘to edit them and
compile them .into form for
publication.

Two other American professors
will participate in the syrnposium,
in addition to Jonas. They are Dr.
Walter R. *Reichart of the Uni-
versity -of Michigan and Dr. Karl
Guthke of‘ th e- University of

California.

The result: a ﬁltering material made of chemically treated
wood pulp and paper that permits Ford~built cars under
normal operation to go from 24,000 to 30,000 miles before
carburetor air ﬁlter replacement is required.

The new, tougher ﬁlter paper is accordion folded to increase
surface area four-fold, permitting higher ﬁltration in a smaller
package. The more matter it accumulates, the better it ﬁlters
right up to its full rated service life. It saves owners time and
money. It keeps Ford-built engines livelier longer.

SOUTH BEND, Ind. — If the loss to Notre Dame achiev-

George Saimes, the leading candidate, along with the popular _

carries and slapped his way clear of the linebackers on three

of ‘those carries. Leeson was
the only consistent ground-
gainer that the Panthers had.

“The hole wasn’t big,” said
Joe Kuharich, the coach of
Notre Dame, “but he just
shook the tacklers off him.
He’s tough_ to stop once his
knees go.
-Stronger Than» Saimes

“He is as strong a fullback
as we have faced,” Kuharich
noted. “He’s not as nifty as
Saimes, but he’s stronger.”

Kelly, of Clairton, who like
just a‘ year_ away from unanimous recog-

lsome unbelievable catches in totaling 11

grabs, three for TDs. It upped his season total to 28,.place_d
himeasily among the top ten pass catchers in the country.

“The passes were coming‘ right where I wanted them,”
Kelly said. “I made a_ couple of catches that'I didn’t, think I
would ‘get, But the ball wasjust coming nice. '

Aware of Weak Secondary

“We knew they -were weak on pass defense,” Kelly ‘said.
“Syracuse and some other teams had good su-ccess against
them passing. We thought we could get them in the hook

zones.”

The best statement for lack of preparedness on; the. ‘

part of the Panthers was Kuharich’s remark about the

secondary defense.

.“I wouldn’t- sell their secondary

short,” he said. Instead of being in a locker room, he
should havelbeenin the stock exchange oﬂice. ‘ _
Why should he sell-Pitt’s pass defense short. All he" had
to do was hold onto it longer‘ and he reaped bigger dividends

as Notre Dame stock soared

with every attempted pass.

Commenting on the game plan_ of throwing a» lot against

the Panthers, Kuharich said,

“Sometimes that can lead to

disaster. A team can adjust their defensive patterns to patch

up their weaknesses.

“It might end up that they have men where you thought
they wouldn’t.” Pitt, apparently, just doesn’t patch up weak-

Notre Dame  
Knew F Defense
Poor on Passes

By JIIVI O’BRIEN

SOUTH "BEND, Ind.
Coach John Michelosen was
proud of the way his boys
kept ﬁghting back Saturday

to rnakea game out of it — and

eventually beat NotreADame, 22-
21 in the ﬁnal three periods.
Notre Dame, however, blitzed
the Panthers, 22-0, in the ﬁrst half
to belt the losers, 43-22, before a

Homecoming crowd of 52,215
here.
The Panthers‘ proved more

vulnerable-to a pass and Notre
Dame just threw and threw. There
were just so many swinging in-
terttfbes downﬁeld as Irish quar-
terback Daryle Lamonica com-
pleted 17 of 27 passes for a stag-
gering 214 yards.

Even his sub, John Huarte, look-
ed liek Sammy Baugh, throwing
against the Pitt secondary. He hit
on three of seven tosses for 29
yards in the waning moments of
the shocker. '

Commenting‘ on his team’s
rallying efforts, Michelosen said,
“It was a team effort.” This was
a sound evaluation of the whole
game. ' _‘

Three Times

At Lock Haven
By FRED MARCUS
LOCK HAVEN — A wen-
splattered Panther s o c c. e r
team outslushed Lock Haven

- in‘ a sea of mud here Satur-

day, 31.

Strong defensive stands by both
clubs, plus the mud, choked off
any scoring until the end of the
second quarter, when Corky
Cuthbert popped in a shot with
seconds left. In the. third period,
Dave Reichenbach broke loose
down the sidelines, faked, and
passed -‘to Cuthbert, who rammed
in number two.

Later ‘that quarter, Cuthbert
socked in a rebound off the goalie
to complete a ‘hat trick,” his sec-
ond of the season. The three goals
move his season’ total up to. 14,

‘record of 17 set ‘by Bob Cherry
in 1955.
Use Fast-Breaks

Bill Johnston put in Lock
Haven’s score in the fourth quar-
ter on a penalty kick. '

The Lock Haven team, which,
reportedly, was able to get bet-.
ter footing due to longer cleats,
tried fast-breaking the Panther
defense, but -goalie Tom Staab
would steal the ball off the open

.man, defenseman Chuck Dun-
bar, Rich Venglik, or Andy Mc-
Graw would kick it away, or
the oozing mud would cut down
the open player.

The Panthers tried to use some
fast-breaks, but many passes sent

Intramural Athletics Fail Test Under Close Scirutiny”

By BOB SMIZIK

Intramural athletics at this
university are about as pop-
ular as a G grade —- and the

_present program is just as in-

complete.
This is self-evident by the

number of forfeitures that have
occured in the intramural football
and softball programs. Thus far
22 per cent of the football games
the

have been forfeited while

are even high-
er. 27 per cent
of the softball

games w e r e
forfeited.
A check of

some 0 t h e r
schools shows
that this prob-
lem is not at all
prevelant. Cin-
cinnati Univer-
sity r e p o r ts
that less than three per cent of its
games are forfeited. John Cina-
cola, intramural director at Du-
quesne University said, “with the
season more than half over, we
have had only one forfeit.

Only One Per Cent
Syracuse University reports an
even better record with less than

BOB SMIZIK

    

 

Page 10 -— THE PITT NEWS — Monday, November 12, 1962

one per cent of its games being
forfeited. ~

The reason for the large num-
ber of forfeits here are num-
erous. They are as follows.

1. Poor officiating.

2. Lac_k of a deﬁnite set ofvrules.

3. The double elimination sys-
tem of playing rather than round-
robin play.

4. Failure to use a stop-clock
during the closing minutes of the

game to avoid stalling and waste
of important time.
Problem Everywhere

Poor officiating is a problem _in
almost every intramural program.
The problem here has been made
more critical because the referees
are associated with the teams in-
volved. *

The least that can be done
with this problem is to have
members of teams not involved

in the game handle the officiat-
ing.

The most that could be done
with the problem is to set up a
system like that at Carnegie Tech
and Duquesne. At Tech, accord-
ing to intramural director, Gene
Boyer, there is an ofﬁcials club
that does _all of the refereeing in
intramural contests. They are paid
$1 a game.

Duquesne has a similar set-up

with a small group of: students do— '

ing the ofﬁciating in all intramural

You'll smoke with a fresh enthusiasm

activity. Duquesne gives these
students tuition-aid for this serv-
ice.

Pitt's intramural director Leo
Bemis is willing to pay $1.25 a
game to student-officials, but
there has been little response.

The rules set up by Bemis and

his aide Ed McFarland have also
been a cause of trouble. While the
rules call for three time-outs a
game, McFarland made it clear to
all teams that time out are not
permitted.
No Rest

This means that a team can not
stop the clock in the closing min-
utes of a game to preserve time,
nor can they call time out to take
a rest.

The rules call for the games
to be played in quarters, yet'
they are played in halves. The
rules call for kick-offs to be
made from the ground yet»ev-
erything from a punt to a kick
oﬁ‘ another player’s toe have
been tried.

Duquesne has a ﬁve page set of
rules covering everything that

will come up in a game. These
rules are strictly enforced.

No Stop-Clock

One thing that is absent from
the rules is a section calling for
the use of a stop clock. It is not
feasible to use a stop clock for
the entire game, but it would be
extremely helpful to use one dur-
ing the closing minutes of each
half.

Without a stop clock time can
be used up quite easily by the
winning team in the closing
vminutes. One hypothetical 'situ-
ation would be a team just
staying in its huddle for the last
two minutes of the game. Num-
erous penalties would be called
on them, but time would run
out since the clock does not stop
for penalties.

At Duquesne the clock is-stop-
ped in the last ‘ﬁve minutes of ev-
ery game just as it is in a regula-
tion collegiate game. Carnegie
Tech’s intramural football games
have the entire ﬁnal quarter play-
ed with a stop clock. Cincinnati

stops the clock for the last two’

minutes of each half.

_ Less Games
Under the double elimination
system some teams get to play
only two games while in league

play they could play as many as
ﬁve or six contests. _
This idea may be ﬁne for in-
dependent league pl 3. y where
many teams drop out after los-
ing a few games, but in frater-
nity competition it denies teams
the opportunitiesyto play rival
games.

“Things are going to get worse

Athletic Director Frank Carver.
“We lose the varsity practice ﬁeld

notch program until the new ﬁelds
are built in the next couple of
years.”

lErnie Borghetti Scores TD

   

 

By GIL McDONALD
The badge of courage for a
football lineman is a crisp block,
a stop in the enemy’s backﬁeld or
catching the opposition’s break-
away back from behind.

But the true utopia is a touch-
down. Some pro linemen go a
dozen seasons without
scored. Panther tackle Ernie Bor-
ghetti fell on a loose ball in the
end zone against Syracuse Uni-
versity in the ﬁrst three minutes
of play to realize his fondest hope.

“It’s always a lineman’s dream
to score a touchdown,” Borghetti
said. “It would have been more
spectacular to run it over, to in-
tercept a pass for instance, but I’
take them.” -

Took A Dive

Recalling the play, he said,
‘‘(Ralph) Conrad hit him and I
was right behind. He made a dive

having

'.,fot' the ball but it got loose again

and I got it.

"I didn"t know it the olﬁcials
would give us the touchdown or
not; it was just a couple of feet
over; it was close.”

Borg-hetti, a 235-pounder ac-
cording to the program and 240
by his own estimate, has always
been a big boy. At Ursuline
High School in ‘Youngstown,
Ohio, he scaled 245.

He started his career as a
tackle there, was named the best
scholastic player in Youngstown,
and found a spot ‘for himself at
the same position here. This year

he arrived after being red-shirt-
ed as a sophomore.

A junior in pre-dental school

work, Borghetti can look forward
to another year of Panther foot-
ball, and possibly another touch-
down.
