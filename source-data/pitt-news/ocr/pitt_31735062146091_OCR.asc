boomerang-ﬂthis year. Things ~sfarted--
badly for they Sophs because the auth-

so that the Freshmen had to be col‘-

‘was donejtheywere marched to the

dinks as Freshmen ._have done‘ before
attimes. Herea difficulty was en-
countered when ‘an attempt was made"
to sell tickets for yest_erday’s Senior-
Counselor. banquet. ‘The Freshmen
seemed to connectlthese mosti~valu'-
able tickets‘ with ‘‘’tickets to assem-
bly.” ‘ Twice the line‘ ran" the gaunt-
let while paddles cracked and Scam-”

duced to the Pitt yells in the “Y” ‘hut,

As usual, Hamilton at Wind-

-during early September, was the Mec-
ca" for «many Pitt Alumni who Wanted .

to see the team doing--its preliminary
training stunts, and ‘also get a little
vacation away ' from the bustling
throng up in one of the quietest places
in the mountains that the good old
state of Pennsylvania affords. H rdly

-"a day passed without some alumni

visiting the camp,"and they were al-
ways accorded ahearty welcome and

‘invited to sit down and break bread

with the crowd. ,

Floyd Rose, Pat Herron, and «Alex.
Stevenson, were on the permanent
coaching‘ staff, Floyd as usual spend-
ing his ‘two weeksﬂ. vacation and help-
ing Pop Warner out. — "V - . .—

Dr.i H, C. {'(.‘fRed”') Carlson, who is
Freshman coach, was also there for a
week and had .a ﬁne time with? his
old pal,‘Pa.t Herron,'thc two in their
day forming‘. one of -the greatest pair
of ends. tliel'Panthers ever had. Jim-
my DeHart,7before leaving to ‘take up
his duties‘ at Washington and Lee, also
spent several days, andother old time

roar foraday or so, “Speedo” Laugh-
ran, who is coach at St. Francis Col-

» lege and others. . ~

Among the .former_ managers there
were Bob‘ Eckhardt, Bil1.Foster and

a very interes-ting talk to-‘the boys,

in camp‘ and made a typical “quick”

which was quite ‘_a help_ .to the ath-

she was asked by the chairman of the
Year Committee to repeat the per-
formance this yearn The Christmas
party will follow the one held last
'ye‘ar,1 being in the form of a Card
Party for the "benefit of the Student
Loan Fund. The.afternoon-to mark
off on your calendar for that party_'..is
December 29th. The affair last ‘year
brought out‘ more Alumnae than any
one social‘ event ever held ’ 'at the
University, not even excepting the
Sunset Dinners, and that fact alone",
the committee felt, was suﬂicient to
callfor another similar Party“ It is
an ‘excellent ‘way to raise money for
the Student Loan Fund. The commit-
tee. in chargeof Helen Donaldson, ’16,
lastfyear was gratiﬁedwith the spirit
of the party, even, thegirls who do
not play_ cards but attended in spite
of that ‘fact seemed to have as good
a t'im'e as those who played._ W/.[argaret_
Ralston Wilson, '18, was -Helen’s right
hand in running the 1922 Card Party
and will be in charge this year.

The Alumnae who have helped with
the Student Loan Fund will be pleased
to know that part of it is in circula-
tion already this year on a case which
came very urgently requested by ‘Dean
Amos. -Depending to a great extent
on.Dean Amos’ recommendations the
committee ‘feels itewill reach the real-

ply deserving persons. ‘The money" of
course is to be repaid after gradua-,

At a meeting of the Interfratern-
ity Cduncil held‘ in the Delta Taud
Delta House last Monday night it-
was announced that no imember of
the conference vsill “rush” students
of the Dental Class of 1927, until
after. the termination of the ﬁrs:
semester. ‘The conference is com-‘
posed of fourteen of Pitt's largest
undergraduate fraternities. ’ i

It is said that the move to ex-‘
clude Dental from the fall rushing
functions was done so at the re
quest of the Dean’ of the Dental.
School. ’ ’ A '

According -to the rules of the In-
terfraternity Conference the rushing:
period‘ will -continu-e until a week
from next Sunday. noon after which
time “bids" are extended‘the selected .

the student to make his choice of the . i

.p1-1oI.Ds RETREAT ,

How to best served Pitt and her stu- ‘H ‘
. M dents was the keynote of the three-'

days retreat of they University Y. M. .
C. A. cabinet held during the’. week- 
end before registration atthe Deer
Creek United -_ -Presbyterian church
east of. Bakerstown in the northern
part of Allegheny county. The retreat
was attended by M, D. Straney. exec-

inet and committee members. ' _
The purpose of this retreat‘ wasto
give a few days of quiet and concen- .
trated study to the -problems of the
“Y” and a favorable opportunity to
buildup committee programs before
the rush oftthe school year. _The reg-
ular cabinet meetings canthus bedde-
voted to ,perfecting these programs,
and the.actualwo_rk can be instituted
soonafter school opens. ,  .
The ﬁrst session was held Saturday
evening when lathe Rev. «John Ray
Ewe‘rs' of the East - End Christian.
church spoke on “Christian Service,”

illustrating -his, talk with episodes» 

from his own student life. ’L‘.l1e rest
of the retreat ‘hinged upon this in-
formal but deeply impressive dis’-
course, and its effect. will be i felt
throughout this year's program. Dr.
Ewers spoke" last year at '-one of ‘the ‘
meetings or the “Y,” Open Forum, and
willprobably be.on'the program again‘
this season.— ‘  _ Y ,
Sunday morning, thesession was de-
voted to reports "and impressions‘ of

the Silver" Bay conferenceof collegiate, -.

“Y” workers to which Pitt sent a large
delegation last June. From these [re-
ports it -was evident that this year’s

conference has been as productive» of .

the desired results as in the past. New
methods of solvinglcampus problems,
new_ improvements in “Y” activities ‘
and helps in gaining student co‘-ope'ra-
tionwhich were introduced and" dis- =
cussed there are to be utilized here in
this ye'a'r'._s program. ' - }
V Committee -reports and -programs
were heard and dis'cuss.e_dA in open
forum «during the Sundaypafternoon
and Monday morning, sessions. The
work ofwthe committees’ responsible
for the. University handbook and for
the. Senior-Counselor plan was criti-
cized and suggestions were made for
improvements. Much-of this work has
been completed for the handbooks
have been distributecl and the ‘Senior-
Counselorébanquet hasbeen held. The .
_committe’ep'chairmen working on the
programs. for social service,‘ the “Y” .,
Open Forum,_ the Monday-noon meet-
ings inthe hut, "missions and Bible
study groups gave outlines of the
work they intended to. carry out and
asked for suggestions. Due to the

committees was discussedbut briefly,
