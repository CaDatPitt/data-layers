Election Nearlyi Delayed

by SHARON SEXTON

A special meeting of the Stu-
dent Elections Committee was
called Wednesday night to iron-out
a ballot positioning squabble
which threatened to delay Tues-
day’s election.

Chuck Steeber, a member of
the SG Judicial Board, called the
meeting when it came to his at-
tention that Larry Manoff, an In-
dependent candidate for the SG
Board, along with four other can-
didates had filed a petition pro-
testing the‘ positioning of Ken
Steinberg, presidential candidate,
and Rich Collins, Board candi-
date, in the number one ballot slot.

One week ago the candidates had
positions on the ballot. At that
time Manoff drew the number one
slot for the Board while Collins
drew number 23.

Between that drawing‘ and the
Monday night meeting a ballot
was drawn up which placed Col-
lins in the number one slot next to
the first presidential candidate,-
Ken Steinberg.

Manoff and the other four can-

didates argued that this last min- ,

ute juxtaposition of names jeo-
pardized their chances of success
in the election. In their campaign
materials they had publicized
their ballot position and they felt
students would be looking for
them in that pre-announced slot.

The candidates were also an-

gered that they had never receiv-
ed official notification of the
change, but had learned about it
by chance.

Prior to the meeting Barbara
Jennings, chairwoman of the
Elections Committee explained
that Steinberg and Collins had
been placed side-by-side on the
number one slot because they
belonged to the same party.

After the meeting was called to
order, it was disclosed that Stein-
berg and Collins had only ‘regis-
tered with the SG Elections Com-
mittee as a party five minutes
prior to the meeting.

Dennis Concilla, arguing for the
five petitioning candidates, stated

that although there was no dead- _ in

line for registering as a party,
the registration had taken place

"after the ballot had been drawn

up and still did not explain why the
Elections Committee had group- \.

ed Steinberg and Collins together. -. « "

Concilla hastened to point out,
“None of the other 23 board can-
didates and none of the other five
presidential candidates have
been grouped according to party
affiliation.’'’ ;

The elections committee con-
ferred on the petition and shortly 7
informed the candidates of their
intention of re-writing the ballot,
using the original sl_ot numbers to
determine the order of the candi- 4
dates. ‘ .

Traffic Court Challenged:

by RICK INFANTE

Students faced with a [traffic
fine and possible further action
are members of a class of per-
sons allegedly not receiving due
process of law because of 'the.pro-
cedural shortcuts taken by the
traffic court management.

Inspired by the Legal Aware-
ness Committee and spearheaded
by Robert L. Byer, a former mem-
ber, a class action complaint in
equity was filed and. heard by
Common Pleas Court Monday,
with a hearing date fixed to ex-
plore the intricacies of Traffic

Court.

Legal advice and assistance has
been obtained from Attorneys
Wendell G. Freeland and Mike
Litman,»coupled with the ener-
gies of the LAC and the legal ex-
pertise of undergraduate Robert
Byer.

A class action constitutes indi-
viduals in an aggrieved position
objecting through the courts on
behalf of themselves and all
others in the same situation. The
plaintiffs, Robert L. Byer, Jack
Pasek (father of LAC Chairman
Jeff Pasek), Barbara L. Jennings,
Elaine F. Scott, and Dennis Dew-
ey, have all received notices of
traffic violations and subsequent
fines.

They and their counsel hope
their complaint can and will rep-
resent the interest of all those
expected to pay a Traffic Court
fine which has been issued by
means of a “rubber stamp” pro-
cess.

The complaint is directed at
Mayor Peter Flaherty, the var-
ious city magistrates, and two
traffic court employees, Angela
Marasco and'Mike Acquar, chief
clerk and cashier of Traffic Court,
respectively.

The thrust of the allegations
brought by the plaintiffs deal with
the seemingly intolerable and in-

equitable methods of prosecution,

exercised by traffic court, speci-
fically, the use of summonses is-
sued by former chief magistrate,
Robert E. Dauer, after he resign-
ed on Dec. 10, 1972. '

Fully one summons, receiv-
ed by the plaintiffs, with Dauer as
issuing authority but dated after
Dec. 10,’were in evidence. A pro-

cedural point concerning the sub-"

scriber ‘to the summons (the
individual who personally attests
to the correctness of the charges),
Francis Ruffalo, is also being
questioned.

The plaintiffs maintain that An-
gela Marasco, the Traffic Court
clerk, is directing the issuance of
summonses coming out of Traffic
Court, although she is not empow-
ered to do so.

Byer also contends that con-

for theviolations in question were" 

processed after these due dates. A

Claims of the usurption of rights A

’ guaranteed by state and federal
constitutions are also being rais-

ed in that the accused never faces , -

his accuser. The plaintiffs main- ,

tain the prosecution’s case is not ..

presented, and hearings are con-
ducted within a framework where
the presumption of innocence is
destroyed. - ;

Byer_ cited cases and synthe-
sized case law to substantiate his .
positions. He further argued for,
a temporary injunction _ which ..
would have effectively dampened
Traffic Court mechanics. Al-
though this latter claim was de'.-
nied, the hearing has been set for

Ls; A new course which examines
how "films raise philosophical
problems is being taught by Rob-
ert Schultz and Paul Larson of the
Philosophy Department. “Films
and Philosophy” aims to sharpen
perceptions of films and to justify
claims of interpretation.

*"One film will be shown each
week’ and be compared —to others
with similar themes, with the ob-
jective of studying how the movies
question each other. In many
cases. a Hollywood production
will be compared with a f'oreign
'; film on thesame topic.

The course ‘Awill consist of two
lectures per week—one by Schultz
and one by Larsoné-and an hour
laboratory for the “dissection” of
films, conducted by a teaching as-

Larson’s lectures are on the phil-

Schultz said.
films are the only living art form.

At Lutheran Center

by MITCH BERRY

Every Thursday at 12 noon the Lutheran University Center holds
, a luncheon.‘followed by a lecture featuring a noted personality from
- the University community. While the program got off to a good start
this tall. attendance has dwindled so that on Thursday. Jan. 4. no one
showed up for the lecture, not even the speaker.

. The Thursday lecture are sponsored by the Graduate, and Profes-
sional Student Association. headed by a selected steering committee of
students. who are advised and directed by Charles W. Carlson and J.
Paul Balas. pastors of the.Lutheran University Center. Both Carlson-
and Balas expressed hope in the future of the lectures despite the re-
cent lapk of interest. »

Saturday, January 20th

RICHARD NIXON was re-elected President of the United States under an elec-
toral mandate to end the war, after prbmising the American people that a
peace treaty would be signed in a matter of days and that ”peace is at hand.”
Arid then he escalated the war with.massive bombings.

WITHOUT MASSIVE U. S. aid, the Saigon dictatorship would crumble. General
Thieu is preventing the reunification of Vietnam in direct violation Of the
Geneva Agreements and the wishes of mostvietnamese. ’ I ‘

There is no lack of interest in the Center’s lunch program in the
Center’s cafeteria. With a, seating capacity of approximately-'50, the
center offers hot lunches to_commuting students: and students who live
on a budget. ,

THE MONEY THAT Nixon is wasting in Vietnam could be used in the United
States to help wipe out poverty and urban decay. It could help give us better
housing,ibetter health care, better education. By his actions, Mr. Nixon is/
proving that he cares more about the Saigon regime than he does about elim-
inating inflation, iinemployment,_racism in the United States. The Hypocrisy of
the Nixon administration goes so far as to jail newsmen andpolitical dissenters
(like Daniel Ellsbergl in the name of ”ireedom,”‘and lends accept_ance to the
killing of students at Kent State and Southern University.’ —

_‘ The l2 noon lectures and the lunch program are scheduled to pro-
vide a refreshing and stimulating noontime break for all students. Carl-
son emphasizes the word “all.” “We are here to serve all of the Uni-
versity community and not just Lutherans.”

He expressed disappointment with the lack of participation in the
lecture program, which hasrecently failed to attract the interest of‘-the
steering committee of the Graduate and Professional Student Associa-
tion. much less individual students.

The next lecture at the center will be on Thursday. Jan. 28. with
Max A.,La_utter, chairman of the University’s Department of Biophy-
sics and Microbiology and chairman of the Commission on Criteria and
Procedures for Promotion and Conferral -of Tenure. as the speaker.
The topic of the lecture will be "The Tenure System." A hot lunch for
65 cents will also be provided and all interested students are invited
to attend.

NO MORE VIETNAMESE or Americans should die because of U.S. interven-
tion. Prisoners of war (American and Vietnamese) should now be permitted to
return to their homes and families. The savage U.S. bombing of Vietnam—on
both sides of the 20th parallc|~—shou|d be ended forever.

‘by ANDREW J. SOPKO
Member, IALF

With the formation of the
Pittsburgh chapter of the Italian
Art and Landscape Foundation in
recent months and the institution
of a new cultural environment
program‘ at our University in
sight. the recent news from Ve-
nice must certainly shock those
of us who hold any sense of con-
cern for aesthetic ecology.

The present dispute. as cited in
The New York Times of this past,
Monday. involves the possibility
of expansion of the industrial dis-
tricts of Porto l\/Iarghera. an
event which will certainly ring
Venice’s death knoll all the loud-
er. .

Informed leaders will recall
how, during this past week, gas
masks were ordered issued to
workers in the Porto Marghera
area due to pollution problems.
This is just another dramatic ex-
ample of the deterioration of the
Venetian environment.

I personally feel that those of us
who hold a genuine concern for
the universal losses which may
occur due to the Venetian demise
should do our utmost to make our
concern known. Venice is a city
which is fighting for its life in a
regard somewhat reminiscent of
Pittsburgh prior to the"‘big clean-
up" of the late 1940's. ~

The truly big difference. how-

. ever. is the fact that so much art

lAniOpen Appeal to Save Venice

is at stake in Venice. And the bat-
tle over Venice is no petty matter:
the Italian government of Pre-
mier Giulio Andreotti is gravely
endangered b_v the controversy.
Certainly this should prove the
importance of Venice‘s problems.

Because of Venice’s short lease
on life, it is up to us to express
our feelings. Concerned stu-
dents and faculty are asked to use
the form letter on this page or to
write thier own letter in response
to the Venetian crisis.

Letters should be addressed to

. Aerial Offense Abandoned

by JOHN METCALFE
The bombs have stopped roaring down on North Vietnam once

._‘;l again, and a lot of speculation has been wasted trying to explain the
"  President’s change of heart, or policy. t

'It has been widely suggested that the election played a part in an

 ’ earlier decision to limit American bombing. It has further been sug-
, gested that Mr. Nixon’s victory inspired him to overreact to what he

considered to be enemy intransigence in late December.

It has rarely been suggested that the President had no idea what
policies were being promulgated by his administration. .

The timing of this most recent interruption of bombing raids sug-
« gests that only now, in the wake of the Super Bowl, do we actually have
,a Chief Executive. -

Last week, in one of his rare public appearances since last Sep-
tember, Mr. Nixon took time to welcome a Chinese acrobatic troupe.
,Aside from his welcoming remarks, he made substantive statements
on only one subject—the Super Bowl. He decided to give no advice on

 .. tactics or on the likely outcome, but to let this highest expression of
L  our way of life play itself out. He is to be commended.

His choice must have been agonizing, as so many Presidential de-

. / fcisions are. The game was played near his Western White House. One
'. .- -team was from Washington, the site. of the original White House. The
" other was from the environs of the Florida White House. What could

he say except nothing? °

 '—  Within hours of learning the outcome of the Bowl, Mr. Nixon in-

 formed himself as to events in Saigon, Paris, Hanoi, and the United

,."..;; States of America over the past five months. Unhesitatingly he chose
"  toend the war.

Assoon as Ron Ziegler and Henry Kissinger tell him what else has

 been going on, he will undoubtedly fix it all up: He has been distracted,
fl‘ but his distraction is now at an end, at least until baseball season
 begins. 

 Rumors that Mr. Nixon is cultivating an interest in basketball and

 ' will in future be unavailable on a year-round basis, should be discounted.

The basketball and football seasons overlap to such an extent that

T .14 the Chief Executive would be required to divide his attention in two di-

yjrections for an unlikely span of weeks every winter.

A Column And A Half

by JOHN METCALFE

Just the other day a uniformed represen-
tative of the government delivered an invita-
tion to join a pornographic book and film club
to my door. To my knowledge, this is the first
such club to advertise cut-rate merchandise.

It is not the first offer of pornography I
have received by mail. Indeed, it is chaste and
restrained by the standards of only a few years
ago. '

Just about and to the right of the address
label there is a description of the contents:
“Sexually Oriented Ad.”

Inside there are blotchy pictures to illus-
trate what I can expect to receive as a mem-
ber. Where the pictures are not coyly posed,
the publishers have resorted to stragically-
placed black rectangles.

I have, occasionally wondered if the more
explicit ads of recent years were not self-de-
feating; if they offered precisely what they
promised, and thus disarmed the impulse to
order merchandise.

Whatever the reason, this offer of an edu-
cational book of photographs, accompanied by
a text guaranteed to inform me of the latest in-
ventions and variations in the field of human
(well, mostly human) sexuality, for $5, is not
in itself pornographic.

The accompanying offer, for “any one of
these five toe-curling films—~with not a single
wasted second devoted to setting or prelude or
plot . . .,” at only $5, was mostly inoffensive,
though suggestive.

Each of the above offers included free
membership in the club. No obligation ever to
buy anything again.

For $10 they offered both the book, the
choice of-the five films and the trial member-
ship.

This event in itself hardly deserves the
space I’ve already given it. I am not especially
offended by the merchandise or the brochure.
The assumption that I need either the films or

the book to fulfill my life is a bit annoying, but-

not conspicuously more so than the assump-
tion of other advertisers that my life will be in-
complete without their deodorants or record
albums. '

I have nothing against having my prurient
interests appealed to; I simply prefer the per-
sonal to the corporate approach. I am disturb-
ed by another factor.

Like everyone with a fixed address, and
not a few occupants, I am constantly bombard-
ed with mailed advertisements.

I have often wondered how I came to these
people’s attention. They were often strangers
to me.

Then, I learned about mailing .li.:sts. Any-
one who has a list of names can sell it to other
advertisers. or to brokerage houses for resale
to advertisers.

These lists can be broken down by income,
interests, education, gender, or political affili-
ation. The more precisely they are segregated,
the more valuable they are.

Some time ago I conceived a way to dis-
cover just who it was who was selling my
name to various advertisers.

Since then I have followed this plan.

Whenver I enter a subscription, join an
organization, seek employment, register in
college, or register a vehicle with the Com-
monwealth, I use a specific variant of my giv-
en name. ’

Sometimes I use my first and family
names only, as with Times, Inc. They have
sold me to an astonishing number of firms,
most of them at least vaguely literary.

Elsewhere I use my middle initial as well.
One book club sold me to most of the Western
world under that name.

On occasion  resurrect the Junior I was
born with, and which appears on my passport.

On two occasions I have used the rather
elegant signature of two initials and my last
name. Thus: J. J. Metcalfe.

One place I used this was the Book of the
Month Club. The other was the University.

And‘ that is precisely the address used to
speed this soft-core ad to my presence.

I am not in the good graces of the .Book
Club. They may have done this to annoy me
(after all, who should know my taste in books
better? ). Butl suspect Pitt, at least a little.

As a technically offended party, I. have a
question for the University: ‘

_ Have you ever, under any circumstances,
sold my name to anyone, either individually or
as part of a list?

If no, good.

If yes, when can I expect toget whatever
sum you charged for my good name?

An Open Letter to Adve1tisingMen

by RALPH DEAN
Dear Sirs:
Ever get a million-dollar» idea?
One struck me the other day while

I was watching some commercial
glop on television. I realized that

the great advertising campaigns -

of the past few years have been
the controversial ones. National
Airlines’ “Fly Me” netted a bun-
dle of free advertising for that
outfit when the Women’s Lib or-
ganiz-ations arose to protest its

sexism. The bitter Hertz-Avis

duel a few years ago was a gold
mine for both companies.

Imagine the small sensation
this brief spot would cause: A
prim, mother-housewife type is
seen squirting some stuff into
the air from a spray can. She
speaks — “Makes your house
smell like all outdoors. And it
eliminates those funny smells in
your son’s room when he’s home
from college.”

You get the idea. Marijuana
will probably be legalized within
the decade. Now, while the shock
value of the weed is still strong,

is the time for smart advertisers ‘

to capitalize on the smoking-re-
lated uses that everyday items
can be put to. The reaction in the
national news magazines alone
would be worth 10 ordinary ad
campaigns. The possibilities are
limitless.

Announcer: “Been getting a

‘harsh draw on your wateﬂrpipe

ll.

lately? It could be caused by min-

erals, flouride, and other impur-1

ities in your tap water. You need

a Culligan water softener to elim- .

inate these and smooth out “hook-

ah harshness. -

‘ How about this one: A man is
shown fumbling with something
in the front seat of a convertible.
He nearly has an accident, then
the announcer says—“Ever get
annoyed fumbling to get a joint in
your car? You need Joint-a-Matic,
the pushbutton flip-up reefer dis-
penser. Handles any size ‘J.’
Great on the dash of your car.
Great for entertaining. Guests

lllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllIllIlllIlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllIllllllllllllllllllllllll.

love it.”

Remember when some minor
genius came out with pre-scuffed

l

blue jeans? I would market them A

with “genuine simulated roach
burns” and make a fortune just on
straights trying to impress their
freaked-out girl friends. High-
schoolers would go wild for them.

Hey, don’t laugh at my ideas.
Ten years from now when you
drive into a place that has a sign
out front saying: “Homeof the
Munchie-Burger-Seven Million
Sold,” remember who advised you
to get in on the ground floor of
this thing.

THE STUDENT GQVERNMENT Programming Committee (PC) has
scheduled four major events for the next few weeks.’

This Friday, Jan. 19, at 9 p.m. the PC and the local chapter of

the National Yoga Society will hold a benefit concert for the Mana-

gua Disaster Relief Fund in David Lawrence Hall. Music will be pro- V
vided by Glass Harp, an Ohio-based group with three albums to
their credit, and two local groups, the Stacker Brothers and the Syl-
vester-Bender Band. All money will be donated to the relief fund.

Saturday, Jan. 27, brings a different twist in music—Hark,
an off-Broadway musical, featuring Dan Goggins playing a harp-

sichord he built himself.

Retired Army Colonol Anthony Herbert, who was in the service
for 20 years, will give a lecture on war crime and atrocities com-
mitted in Vietnam on Monday night, Jan.‘29.

After a long-awaited period, the University returns to the
Syria Mosque on Feb. 10 with John Sebastian, former leader of
the lovin’ Spoonful. Special_guest stars will be McKendree Spring

and Howdy Moon.

 Arlislry Demonslroled by

Sludio Arts Faculty"  

by DEAN SIEGAL

I was pleased to see the wide
range of creative talent of our fac-
ulty of the Studio Arts and Art Ed-
ucation Departments displayed at
an exhibition of their artistic
achievements at our University
art gallery.

The nine instructors are well
represented, and this year, new
art instructor Susan Hauptman is
the featured artist. An entire
room is devoted to her
Drawings” in black and white.
Done in ink upon a gessoed mas-
onite support, her work repre-
sents not only a great deal of tal-
ent, but an equally great amount
of time and patience.

She has used line and its effects
to the utmost. Some of her work
resembles a hand-drawn street

map. Sometimes, the lines juxta- »
' posed to one another come so

close together, they. seem almost
to join. The effects of this make
shadows and graduations of color.
Black ink ona white background
is changed into effects of black,
white, and gray.

From a distance, some of’ these
lines seem to form parts of the
body, and other interesting
shapes. Often, her supports are
divided into three or four parts to

. complete her thought. I heartfully

welcome you Ms. Hauptman!

Of course, Chairman Virgil Can-
tini is back, with his usual con-
tributions. His exhibit last year
was marvelous as he displayed his

aluminum sculptures and enam-

els on steel. His enamels this

year employ the most beautiful, «

bright, sharp, resonant colors in
the exhibit.

Robert Qualters has also re-
turned with his Pierre Bonnard
“Intimist” _attitude toward art.

A Bonnard was giventhat label be-

cause he had his own interpreta-
tions of what life really is. Qual-
ters seems to have reflected this
type of view with his annoying
boldness of color, texture, and
subject matter. His paintings have
this juvenile quality about them
with colors to match.

This year, Thomas Lacey has
“shown us four marvelous marble
sculptures. His best is his ‘small-

"Line =

est, called “Jonathan and Fletch-
er."

David Keeton‘s fine use of col-
or and line is equally great. Last

year his exhibit lacked interest in

comparison to the others repres-
ented. This year, he shines bright.

Of course, the exhibit could not
be complete without Ming Fay,
and his incomprehensible expres-
sions. Actually, I was ’f"""9. im-
pressed by one of his C0l'I1_.JSl-
tions. It is housed in the center
room of the gallery and’ is entitled
“One.” It consists of a rope made
into a circle /surrounding sand
with a clay ball at the midpoint
of the circle. It sounds very sim-
ple, but the effects of light cast
shadows on the ball. Those shad-
ows against the texture of the
sand make a very -interesting
composition and certainly suggest
the concept of oneness.

The “Multi-Visual Spatial Com-
positions” of Girts Purins employ
a fine sense of color and design.
His work contains a great deal of
interest but their major qualify-
ing point is color. They are intense
and attractive and add a great
deal to the show as a whole.

Thomas Brungers’ plexiglas
and polyester resin sculptures
have a great simplicity about
them. Unfortunately, his prices
for his work are not as simple as
his sculpture.

The exhibition as a whole is a
fine representation of the many
diversified talents of our faculty.
It merits your visit now through
Jan.28. ~

“Young Winston"-Mediocrity Works

Winston Churchill

It would be easy to dismiss
Young Winston as one of those
Hollywood spectaculars of yester-
year with a cast of thousands. In
reality, it is a British produc-
tion that manages to hold the
viewer’s attention as well as be
entertaining.

exallcmon . -."'i

Young Winston is the film adap-
tation of Winston Churchills’ A
Roving Commission,‘ My Early
Life, with Robert Shaw and Anne
Bancroft as Lord and Lady
Churchill and Simon Ward as
Young Winston in the Carl Fore-
man and Richard Attenborough

' Production.

Attenborough and Foreman are
trying to show us how one of the
century’s most important men
triumphed over his deprived
childhood-—a father that is disap-
pointed in him and a mother who
has neglected him.

We see young Winston as an
egotistical young man bent on be-
ing noticed to further his political
ambitions and possibly to obtain
lost love. For Young Winston, the
easiest way for him to do this is
to be awarded as many medals as
possible and ride a white horse.
We see young Winston at three
stages—as a chubby seven-year-
old, a 13-year-old and as a boy be-
coming a man, ages 17 to 25.

Foreman takes great pains to
show young Winstons‘ tragedies

at these ages. At seven, it is the
initial shock of leaving home to go
to school. At 13 he has a confron-
tation with his father. an amus-
ing scene reflecting on the rea-
sons why Winston has never been
a scholar. “The headmaster tries
to find out what I know but never
seems to ask me a question I
know the answer to.”

Young Winston, upon his gradu-
ation from Sandhurst (British
West Point), is seen fighting in
the Sudan, India, and the Boar
War, in each area demonstrating
feats of unbelievable heroics. But,
he is supposed to be a correspon-
dent; equally confusing is his
seeming ignorance of the fact that
dead heroes can’t hold office.

Young Winston survives his acts
of glory overnight to become his
countrys’ hero, leading to his
election to Parliament.

Simon Ward gives a rather un-
even performance as Winston, al-
though there is an uncanny facial
resemblance. Never looking a day
older than 17, he is still seen go-
ing through themotions of being a
big man in Parliament. Ward also
gives a rather poor imitation of
an old Churchill as the narrator.

Anne Bancroft as I Winstons’
American mother and Robert
Shaw as his father are not really
developed in the film, only a fee-
ble attempt is made to do this in

an interview situation with the re-
porter off camera and the subject
sitting facing the camera. As ob-
noxious sounding as Howard Cos-
ell or possibly Myron Cope, he
pries into the private lives of

Lord and Lady Randolph, hoping I
for a scoop with the spice of scan-

dal.

It is hard to say why the film A

works. Possibly its’ level of me-

diocrity is pleasing, never raising V‘ A

its rose-sepia cinematography _

, The National Collegiate Athletic
Association, at its annual conven-
tion in Chicago this past weekend.
eliminated the vague 1.6 eligibil-
ity’ rule and solidified its position
_as a governing body by restrict-
-ing the number of scholarship al-
lotment to its member schools. - _
 The 1.6 rule. which was passed
‘in 1965, required all incoming
high school athletes to predict a
college grade of 1.600 (C—) to be
-eligible for an athletic grant. Now
.theyjwill have to achieve a C av-
lerage in order to be acceptable.

,~ ‘-While it seems that the new rule
isfharsher, it will not penalize
athletes who had trouble with the
-f:co_llege boards. The 1.6 rule was
voted down‘ by a vote of 204-187.
‘1»I'n ‘what appears to be a more
/-"dramatic move. the convention
__voted to restrict the number of
“'collegiate football grants that may
j.jbe git/en out. This rule. which will
go ‘into effect with the coming of
the 1973-74 school year. will allow
'a’ll'member institutions a total of
30 grant in aids per year. ‘ s

.. The NCAA had no previous re-
strictions on scholarship allot-
ment and this move is expected to
relieve universities of the rising
‘gc_o's_t of maintaining a football
fteavm’.

 " The convention also set up

guidelines for junior
transfers and voted down a pro-
posal that would ‘have made schol-
arship distribution be determined
on a need basis. Also. voted down
was a proposal to set up an accept-
able form of tenders for prospec-
tive incoming athletes. This rule
would have demanded an athlete
to either accept or turn down a
scholarship offer within ten days
and would have set a deadline
(March 1) for football grants and
May 1 deadline for other sports.

The convention also did away

Grants will now be distributed on

ly eliminate "free rides“—that is.
prevent athletes from accepting
an athletic scholarship and then
refusing to participate.

year academic average in order
to be eligible to transfer to an-
other NCAA school.

The" University, which had re-
cently dropped out of the Big Four
Agreement—which allowed » 25
football scholarships a year —

welcomed the change in the .per- -

son of Casmir Myslinski, the ath-
letic director.

"I-think colleges should have.

some form of limitation." Myslin-
ski said. ~ ‘

The Big.Four only applied to

Pitt. Penn State. Syracuse. and

West Virginia. while the new set-'

up will restrict all schools and
will violators will have to answer
to the NCAA for failure to coin-

New Pitt head coach John Ma-
jors. who was expected to recruit
upwards of 40 athletes in the first
couple of years here, accepted the
change seemingly uncrathed. ‘

“I still think -we can build the
program under the new NCAA
rule,” Majors said. “We didn’t
plan to recruit wholesale and ac-
cumulate mere numbers.”

But, he did indicate it might be
a little tougher. ‘

I Iii their series with Notre Dame that began’ in’

So far during the '72-73 campaign the Fight— .

ing Irish have compiled a not too impressive 4-6
record.

The only opponent that both Notre Dame and
Pitt have had in common so far this year is the
ever powerful UCLA. While the Fighting Irish were
soundly defeated by the Bruins by the score of
82-56, the Panthers came much closer to. a victory
against the perennially, strong squad, dropping the
contest by only 16 points by the score of 89-73.

The Panthers performance against the Uclans

was thejbest competition that UCLA has had in the
past three years at home.

, By far the most exciting victory for the_i\'otre

Dame cagers this year must be the win over the
Marquette Warriors on Saturday.

The Irish managed to edge the Warriors in the
last seconds of the game by the score of 71-69. ‘Pre-
vious to the contest, Marquette, had been unbeaten
and had been ranked number three.

Marquette’s loss to Notre Dame cracked its 81

game home" court‘ winning streak at the Milwau- I

kee Arena and brought its season record to 11-1.

‘The hero in the last minutes of the game was
sophomore guard Dwight Clay. who is a native

Pittsburgher. While playing for 'Pittsbui'gh‘s Fifth -

Avenue High School two years ago. Clay made All-
City and All—State.

The 5-ll Clay scored only seven points through-
out the game, but four of them proved to be crucial
for Notre Dame.

With 1:08 left in the contest. Clay made two
points good from the charity line to give the Fight-
ing Irish a 69-67 lead.

But the Warriors came back to tie it up and so
it was up to Clay again to pull thelrish back into the
lead. The Pittsburgher came through with only four
seconds remaining, giving Notre Dame the win by
hitting on a jump shot from the corner.

High scorers for Notre Dame in the Marquette
game were sophomores Gary Brokaw and John
Shumate, who scored 28 and 21 points, respectively.

. Junior Gary Novak. who led the Irish in scor-
ing (19.5 percentage) and rebounding (10.31 last
year. has also been aiding Notre Dame in its efforts
to produce a winning season.

The «top man for the Panthers who will be com-
batting the Notre Dame squad is junior Billy
Knight.

‘In the contest against Bucknell on Saturday
Knight sc'ored'27 points and this marked the sixth
straight timein the last seven outings that he has

' scored over 20 points. '_ v v- ' h

NEWLY named Pitt football coach John-
ny Majors will hold another news confer-
ence—this one for the clown trodden stu-
dent football fans of the University.

Majors, who has been out of town,
continually recruiting, since his appoint-
ment, will start with what he considers
the root of the fan problem—the student
body. The former Iowa State coach will
speak at the Student Union Ballrooom
Thursday night, Jan. 26, at 7:30.

Majors will mingle with the student
fans in attendance before addressing the
group formerly and answering questions,
it was announced by Pitt Sports informa-
tion Director Dean Billick Friday.

Majors a firm believer in student sup-
port and this bit of ‘‘internal public rela-

that so many good things have been said
about. '

  Says “No”

"Wesuffered in depth against
competition in the past." he
noted. "Even 35 recruits this

quitéd rumors which had him returning to Skyscraper U as a '

head recruiter.

Hart had for some mysterious reason re—visted his former
place of employment before John Majors was hired as the new
mentor. And, when Majors said’ that Hart was a “personal.
close friend” of his, the appointment seemed forthcoming.

Hart had been quoted as saying that he ,was interested. but

I’ that it would take more than a recruiting post to land him.

"Hart, who is presently serving as an assis-
tant to the president at Robert Morris College,
said’ that “once and for all” he would stay at
his present post.

What had been called a roadblock to Hart's
appointment left the University last week. Ser-
afino Fazio, who had served as head recruiter
the past year, resigned’ his post to take an as-
sistant coaching job at the University of Cincinnati.

Fazio’s resignation——which leaves only Willie Jeffries and
Steve Petro from the Carl DePasqua regime—and Hart’s disin-
terest leaves the vacated job in a cloud of uncertainty. It is not
yet known if the post will be withheld.

* * *

If the Athletic Department doesn’t fill Fazio’s position,
what of its contention that it had lagged ten years behind by not

- having a head recruiter until last spring? ?— ?

II: 3|! _ *

Before he left. Fazio insisted that he was not forced out
and left of his own volition. But. the Pitt News thinks the Ath-
letic Department did leave a few casual hints lying around for
Fazio to pick up. V

Fazio was not Major's hand picked man and/he was appar-
ently smart enough to realize it. Anyway, that’s the way it

should be if the new coach is to produce—and so much is expect— .

ed of Majors. They call it “Carte Balnche."

When the Big Four was dropped before Thanksgiving, AD
Casmir Myslinski said that it was more of a physchological
move than anything else. When this reporter, who has seen
the evils of the Big Four first hand, as a result of practically
living with the football team through its worst year in history,
witnessed members of the news media, agreeing with Myslin-
ski, it became albitter pill to swallow.

. So. when Majors said that he would not have taken the Pitt
job if the Big Four was still intact. at his first news conference.
a smile eased across the face of the same collegiate reporter.

What do you say to that Cas?

This what Carl DePasqua had to say about his failure to

win at the school he though so much about as an alumni:

“Its like falling in love with a girl you know you cant have." I

Graduating senior Bill Mercer had this to say when he
learned DePasqua had been fired:  : .. ’ 5

Cubs   Demolish

Pitt-Greensburg

by RON SIEGEL

GREENSBURC. Pa.—Pitt‘s junior varsity basketball team re-
bounded from their first defeat of the season to trounce Pitt-Greens-
burg on Monday. 99-58. On Saturday night. the Cubs suffered a 70-64 de-
feat to the Youngstown junior varsity.

John Endsly recovered from a 12 point performance in Youngs-
town to lead all scorers with 30 points and also to lead in rebounding
with 15. '

Just as in Pitt's 109-62 victory earlier this season a/t the Field
House. the outcome of the game was never in doubt after the opening
tipoff. _

Pitt opened the scoring quickly, and built up a 12 point lead be-
fore Greensburg got on the scoreboard. Pitt continued to dominate play
and held a 20 point lead throughout the first half, and led at half-
time, 44-24. ’

Greg McBride was the hottest Pitt player in the first half. hitting
for 17 points, and finished up the game with a total of 25. Willie Kelly
hit for 19 points. and Mark Disco and Bobby Shrewsbury also finished
in double figures. V,

The second half was dominated by Endsly. who hit for 22 in that
half alone. McBride and Kelly each added 13 rebounds to ice up the
game for the Cubs. who dominated every facet of play in the second
half. , -

The loss of freshmen Keith Starr and Tom Richards to the varsity
forced coach Tim*Grgurich to call upon‘ one of last ’year’s freshmen
stars, Kevin Aul, to rejoin the team for the remainder of the season.

Varsity manager LeftyrBooth made his jayvee playing debut in the

game. and picked up three assists, as well as twoipersonal fouls

The team has been playing most of their games with the knowledge
that if more than one of them foul out. they are in big trouble. "Its
good for the young guys to have the situation." said Grgurich. "They
know that they have to work." ‘

Grgurich was not at the game lost to Youngstown, but made it
clear to the players before the game that he wasn’t too pleased with-
it_. Their play Monday was a great improvement as the Cubs proved
by hitting for their normal 95 points, rather than the 64 against, Youngs-
town.

"If they do what they did tonight," explained Grgurich. "Nobody’s
going to beat them. Our strength is rebounding. and in dominating un-
der the hoop. We have four good big men. and I know Bobby’s tShrews-
bury) going to get the ball to them. It’s up to them to put it in.”

The Cubs’ record now stands at 5-1. and their next game is Satur-
day at the Field House. when they host the St. Frances junior varsity.

Fights Spark Ice Action

by BART MACK

According to any hockey rule book. fighting is
definitely not supposed to be a part of any given
hockey game. When it comes to the Western Penn-
sylvania Intercollegiate Hockey Association and. in
particular. the Pitt Hockey Club. the rule seems to
bend to fit the style ofplay that is common to the
team.

The WPIHA does adhere to the rule book used
by the National Hockey League. but fights are just
about as common as goals. especially when it comes
to Pitt. There hasn't been a Pitt game so far this
season that lacked a round of fisticuffs.

That doesn‘t mean that the local college league
advocates fighting. In fact. the third_man rule re-
cently invoked in the NHL holds fast for any alter-

cations that occur between college opponents. Un-f ‘
der that rule. any player entering a fight as the A 
third party will receive a game misconduct penalty. 
which means, that skater is gone for the night. '
That rule has curtailed the fights to pairs and
has ended bench emptying brawls, but the skirm-V 
ishes still happen regularlyfln Pitt’s case, its;
style of play is at least partially responsible for
numerous fights involving Pitt players. _' _ _
Statistically the biggest team. man for man... 
Pitt uses the size and strength of its skaters to 1
its advantage. Pitt coaches Tom Myers and Guy 
Carole are constantly emphasizing the importance’ 1,
of playing the body instead of the puck and their 
strategy has been extremely successful. ‘ I y» 
Another factor that is definitely a cause for two”
players to drop their sticks and gloves and com- ' 
mence swinging is the short tempers of the major- I. 
ity of skaters in the WPIHA. These college-icersv .77
are far from being even semi—professionals and few ._
can take a hard shot without wanting to retaliate  
instantly. ~ _ " e 
The Pitt team is no exception in that category.‘ 
There is one interesting note, however, Pitt skatersJ.__“’f
rarely lose a fight. Last Saturday at the Alpine Ice‘?-,i
Chalet, Denny Browne and C. H. Bender tangled in 
front of the Dukes’ net and Browne skated away» the  
winner. When the Browne-Bender altercation broke'« ,
out, John Sullivan hopped over the boards by ‘the~$-"‘_"?'f
Duquesne bench to enter the melee. He was met‘,..,;;i-

or seven” possibilities are under

The reserved Schmidt, 40, an
All-American at the University of
Pittsburgh, said he quit because
“coaching isn’t fun anymore,”
but it was never too much for the
stocky blond who anchored the

‘famous Lion defenses of the 1950s.

Schmidt retired from playing
after 13 years to take the head
coaching job in 1967, replacing
Harry Gilmer a target of many a
Tiger Stadium snowball.

Schmidt, Lion owner William
Clay Ford, and General Manager
Russ Thomas put a “five year
plan” into effect, and when the
Lions reached the playoffs with
a 10-4 record four years later, it

seemed about to producea cham-
pion. 9 ~

But the job of turning the once
laughable offense into a powerful

attack came home to haunt De- ,

triot, and the aging defense broke
down.

The team compiled only medio-
cre 7-6-1 and 8-5-1 records the
past two years '

Schmidt’s resignation appeared
to come more from his frustratio
with the job and disgust with the
media abuse for his failure, rath-
er than from the pressure of a
frank reevaluation following the
team’s second place finish in the
National Football Conference’s
