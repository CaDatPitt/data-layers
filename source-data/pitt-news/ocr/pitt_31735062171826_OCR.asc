Dorm Review Slated

by CAROLE COVAL

Robert J. Paternoster, direc-
tor of the Pittsburgh City Plan-
ning Commission, plans to hold a
meeting with representatives of
the University, Oakland commun-
ity and City Planning to review
plans for the ‘construction of the
Hillside Dorms.

“It’s a good time for all three
parties to sit down together and
discuss the issues,“ Paternoster
said.

Oakland residents have already

expressed their apprehension
about the environmental changes

they predict will occur due to con-
struction. In recent open hear-
ings, sponsored by City Planning,
they cited increased traffic flow
and “people pollution" as two of
the results.

“The open hearings held by the
Planning Commission gave people
an opportunity to voice the depth
of their concerns,” the director
said.

Another open hearing will be
held on March 25 in the Public
Safety Building. The hearing will
focus on the specific construction
requirements.

Paternoster said that there are
other concerns to be discussed
other than the physical aspects
of the proposed construction when
the three groups meet.

Because Mayor Peter Flaherty
enacted a moratorium on con-
struction by tax-exempt institu-
tions six months ago, Paternoster
said that the university may “pay
to the city in lieu” of the tax loss.

Regardless of the outcome of
this meeting, or series of meet-
ings, all three viewpoints will
have to “yield somewhat." Pater-
noster concluded.

A MEMBER of the Pittsburgh
People's Peace Treaty reported
a bomb scare to campus police
Monday afternoon after a
“deep, husky voice” telephoned
to announce that its office
would receive a “present.” The
Peace Treaty room is located in
the Revolutionary Socialist Un-
ion office in 516 SU.

It was reported that the uni-
dentified caller asked wheth-
er or not People's Peace or RSU
were “splinter groups of the
SDS." Although the caller was
told that neigher were operat-
ing in that capacity, he main-
tained that the “present”
would be sent.

Campus police then closed
the office for the remainder of
the day, after making a check
of the premises.

DR. ROBERT P. GALLAGHER has been named the new director of the Uni-

versity Counseling Center, according to Vice Chancellor Bernard Kobosky.
Gallagher's plans include the development of a career and guidance

program to assist students in making career decisions earlier in their college
years in the fact of a very difficult employment market.

He also has a goal of increasing the availability ofcareer information
to women students, many of whom are seeking employment in new fields.

Some things about the Counseling Center will not change, according
to the new director. “The student really gets a hearing here,” he said. “'We
don't want to lose that with a lot of new programs.” '

A study skills and motivation program may also be added, he 
Dr. Warren T. Hill, former director of the center, will devotoall of his

time to his responsibilities as a University counselor and will assume pri-

mary responsibility for staff development and the training of student

counselors.

Center Initiates Student

Career Counseling System

by BOB BONN

A program of encounter groups
on career decisions, letting stu-
dents help themselves while help-
ing others, is soon to be imple-
mented by the University Coun-
seling Center.

According to Dr. Gallagher. di-
rector of the Counseling Center.
the plan is to recruit about 70 jun-
iors who would like more clarifi-
cation on their career plans. They
will form ten small groups, each

Mailbox Plan Explored

A joint committee of the Fresh-
man Women's Council and the
Commuter Association (CA) is
exploring the possibility of pro-
viding commuters with campus
mailboxes.

Tom Gainan, president of the
CA, said that these mail boxes
would facilitate communications
between individuals who have
trouble making connections due to
schedule differences and would
extend the use of the campus mail
system to commuters.

The committee hopes these mail
boxes will expose commuters to
the student activity information
received by dorm residents. This
is in keeping with the CA5 hope
to integrate commuters into the
mainstream of campus life.

According to Gainan, approxi-
mately four individuals will share
each mail box.

A response from around 1,000
individuals will be enough to put
the plan into operation.

Interested commuters can place
their names, addresses and stu-
dent numbers in the boxes which
have been placed on the informa-
tion desk of the Student Union.

of which will meet for an hour a
week for the rest of the term.

Each group will be led by a pro-'
fessional counselor, who will pro?"

vide the type of help that the stu-
dents may need, including identi-

fying specific kinds of talent and"

temperament, providing up-to-
date career information and util-
izing tests.

Next fall, when the students are
seniors, each one will have the
opportunity to lead his own ca-
reer encounter group, which will
be composed of seven sopho-

mores. The professional counse-' ‘

lors will then act only as consul-
tants and resource persons.

“The purpose of the groups,”
according to Counseling Center
Director Dr. Robert Gallagher,
“will be to get students actively
involved in the process of influ-
encing their own future rather
than just letting it happen.”

By fall, about 500 sophomores
will have had the opportunity to
benefit from the program. The
senior leaders will have learned
how to help others in a group sit-

uation by having been helped’ I

themselves.

“Through the group process,
students should gain perspective
on their own developmental pro-
cesses and use this perspective in

thinking realistically and crea- ’

tively about their future,” ac-
cording to Gallagher.

Interested juniors may sign up ’

for the program at the Universi-
ty Counseling Center, 205 SU.
They will then be notified when

their first group session will take A

place.

In the past this committee has

cause of -"more pressing prob-
lems." however. it had to be put
off.

“Now that we have our house in
order,” he said, “we can go ahead
with the project.

"I conducted a survey last
spring which showed that there
were nine blind students on cam-
pus. Although this is a small num-
ber.“ Lederman insisted. "the
Pitt News should be available to
all."

Lederman originally intended
the paper to be punched out in
braille. “but because of the high
costs, recording tape proved more
feasible."

As plans now stand, News and
WPGH staff members will read
each issue and the tapes will be
placed in Hillman for permanent
cataloging. “The recorded News
will probably be in the Center
within two days after each issue
is out,” the business manager

by signing a contract with the
bondsman ‘or by the committees

A lawyer, whose services will
be obtained on a retainer fee, will
be available to any student who
gets arrested—. He will be present
at the police station and the pre-
liminary arraignments.

After the immediate arrest sit-
uation is over. the student will
have the responsibility of finding
his own lawyer. Ging added, how-
ever, that the committee will help
if the student cannot find one.

The committee is also in the

process of setting up a new pro-

gram on campus which involves
the cooperation of the campus po-
lice.

“When an arrest is made on
campus, the campus police will
notify the Legal Awareness Com-
mittee. We will have a lawyer at
the station for the questioning and
for the preliminary arraign-
ment,” Ging stated.

subjects as tenants rights. arrest

In reference to the incident,
President Nixon described it as a
“shocking act of violence which

“Our Vietnam madness.”

Reports were then received
from Washington at noon on Mon-

received and the capitol office
buildings were cleared for a short
time. The threat did not mater-

An intensive investigation of the
entire situation has been under-

Pa. House Okays Lower

Voting Age, Amendment

Plea Also Before Senate

by IAN HEISS

House Bill 209-467. a proposal
to change the election codes. and
to give eighteen year olds the
right to vote. passed the Penn-
sylvania House by a vote of 194-
8. The bill will soon be put on
the Senate calendar.

Also before the Senate is a
bill sponsored by Senator Reid-
man which asks to change the

voting age by constitutional
amendment.
“There are two schools of

thought on the subject." said
Senior Reidman. “Some feel that
a constitutional amendment is
not necessary because the Penn-
sylvania State Constitution does
not specifically deny eighteen-
year olds the right to vote".

"Others." Reidman added.
“are doubtful of the constitu-
tionality of the move. " She

speculated that. "it may be that
the Senate will approve the
change in election codes and
bring the constitutional amend-
ment to a referendum in the
May primary."

The voting age for national
elections has already been low-
ered by the Federal Government
and has been approved by the
Supreme Court.

Levering Asks Accent

The voting age for Pennsyl-
vania offices remains at twenty-
one until the State Senate acts
on one of the two bills before it.

Senators Fleming. Republican
Minority Leader. and Lamb.
Democratic Majority Leader.
were not available for
ment. Senator Reidman. howe-
ver. feels the chances of the
bill’s passage are "good."

In conjunction with the anti-
cipated passage of House Bill
209, is a voter registration drive
and a political forum in the Stu-
dent Union Ballroom entitled
"Politics '71".

The drive will be held,this
Friday. from 9:00 a.rn. till 6:00
p.m. in the Fifth Avenue Hall-
way of the Student Union. Stu-

dents 18 years or older may reg-

ister to vote.

The drive is co—ordinated by
Jane Thompson. head of the
Citizenship Information Center
(CIC).

Students may obtain registra-
tion forms from last Friday Pitt
News. from Bill Lenaghen. in
room 501 S.U.. and at the CIC
on the twelfth floor of the Ca-
thedral.

On 'Human Needs ’

Dr. Samuel Levering urged a
reordering of national priorities
to ensure that “human needs
take precedence over military
buildup" in a speech Monday
night.

Levering. Chairman of the Ex-
ecutive Council of the Friends
Committee on National Legisla-

- tion. spoke to a sparse crowd at

a meeting of the Pittsburgh Coa-
lition on National Priorities Mon-
day evening in the Student Un-
ion.

Claiming that "Massive mili-
tary buildup does not further the

causes of democracy and free-'

dom.“ Levering. also a member
of World Federalist USA and
Federation of American Scien-
tists. decried military assistance
of such totalitarian governments
as Franc-o’s Spain.

Pointing out that the US. mil-
itary has also spread into domes-
tic affairs. Levering queried
rhetorically. “Is everyone happy
knowing that the US. army has

Levering proposed four spe-
cific actions. According to the
Southern visitor. “Exit from Viet-
nam is paramount to world
peace. Not only are U.S. actions
in Indochina immoral; they
are also deleterious to our over-
all aims of democracy and free-
dom.“

The three other actions pro-
posed included recognition of
Communist China, rebuilding
the United Nations, and at-
tempts by U.S. citizens to con-
vince congressmen of the ne-
cessity of a reduced military
budget. ‘

Stating that the time is ripe
for world peace. Levering sug-
gested that all citizens interest-
ed in peace begin work now
to bring it about through the de-

Med School Recruits
Blacks, Finds Snags

by LEE EILS

(Editor's note: Last Wednes-
day, Lee Eils reported on the
efforts of the Med School to re-
cruit more blacks and stimulate
undergraduate interest among
blacks. Today, Eils discusses some
of the problems encountered by
the Med School in those endea-
vors.)

The faculty of a medical school
faces frustrating problems in its
attempts to draw and enroll min-
ority applicants. Aware of the
crying need for more doctors
to serve minority communities.
medical faculty and administra-
tors experience difficulty in
both demonstrating their desire
for minority students and fair-
ly evaluating a minority appli-
cant‘s potential performance in
medical school and as a doctor.

In Pittsburgh. where the black
community constitutes the larg-
est single minority. the faculty
of the Pitt Medical School is
employing a variety of its avail-

able resources to recruit. evaluate.

and enroll minority students.

The medical school has ac-
cepted 20 black applicants for
the fall class but not one of
these comes from the lower cam-
pus. When asked whether any
black Pitt undergraduates ap-
plied to the medical school,
Dean of Admissions Dr. Samuel
P. Harbison replied, “I don’t
think so, and this is something I
can’t understand. We'd much
rather have people from right
here.”

Dr. Harbison added that the
absence of such applications was
in large part due to the relative
scarcity of black seniors at the
University. It has only been in
the last three years that the Uni-
versity has enrolled proportion-
ately more blacks.

MCAT Significant
The Medical College Admis-

sions Test (MCAT) has long been
a stumbling block for the min-
ority applicant. but faculty and

cal School are anxious to have
it known that the MCAT‘s are
less significant for the minori-
ty applicant than they are for the
non-minority applicant.

According to Dr. Raymond L.
Hays, associate professor of An-
atomy and Cell Biology, “The
MCAT does not measure the
aptitude of the minority stu-
dent for medicine.” Dr. Hays,
a black also pointed out that
the MCAT may discriminate in
other ways.

“An individuals score on the
MCAT is. in many respects. a
reflection of the school and the
type of exposure one gets at that
school." he said. "For this rea-
son. the tendency has been to
tone down the significance of
the MCAT as an admissions re-
quirement."

Dr. Harbison also feels that
the test deserves only limited
weight. “I think it‘s probably
valid in the quantitative and sci-
ence areas. but that‘s it."

Asked about possible alterna-
tive examinations, he said, “I
don’t see anything in sight. None
of them have much to do with the
individual. I think there's been
a tendency for students to over-
emphasize the emphasis we place
on the MCAT’s.”

Dr. Harbison pointed out that
minority applicants are inter-
viewed three times and that
these interviews combined with
records and recommendations are
considerably more significant
than MCAT scores.

Recruitment

An equally important part of
the admissions program is the
creation of interest on the part
of minority applicants both at
Pitt and elsewhere. The Pitt
Committee on Medical Education
for the Minority Group Student.
headed by the medical schools‘
dean. Dr. Donald N. Medear-
is. acts in this capacity. Both Dr.
Harbison and Dr. Hays are ac-

tive members of the committee.

Says Dr. Hays, “Our recruit-
ment of black students has in-
volved visits by faculty and rep-
resentatives of the medical
school administration to so-call-
ed ‘black’ colleges and univer-
sities. It has, by no means, been
limited to this, since that in-
creasing numbers of black stu-
dents are to be found at tradi-
tionally white schools. The ra-
tionale for using traditionally
black colleges is quite logical
in that these colleges have en-
rolled the largest numbers of
black students concentrated on

a single campus. We put our,

efforts into areas where we feel
they will do the most good.”

Dr. Harbison cited Central
State College in Ohio and Lin-
coln University in Pennsylvania
as two traditionally "black" in-
stitutions where the medical
school recruited this year.

Concerning adaptation of the
medical schools curriculum to
the needs of the minority stu-
dent. Dr. Hays said that. “Ef-
forts are underway to develop
programs through direct parti-
cipation of black faculty. These
efforts we hope will be expand-
ed. because there‘s no question
of the relevance of such expos-
ure to the student and to his as-
pirations toward a career in me-
dicine. The students have pro--
vided the impetus for this."

Says Dean Harbison, ‘The sen-
ior year is entirely elective. The
black student is entirely free to
elect his own program. This
includes delivery of care in the
ghetto.”

Dr. Harbison also pointed out
that efforts were being made to
draw more black faculty. There
are presently eight black fac-
ulty members serving the medi-
cal school in one capacity or an-
other. In Dr. Harbison‘s opin-
ion. this relative scarcity is due
largely to the low pool of avail-
able black instructors.

gﬂousing Survey a Bust

BY KATHY MCCANN

(Editor's Note: McCann is a Pitt News Staff writer and member
of SA OH-Campus Housing Committee.)
The chances are that every student living in off-campus housing
has some kind of gripe about his living conditions. The most ‘famil-
iar complaint is that landlords are unresponsibe to repair requests.

“I told him last week to fix the shower and I haven't heard from

Women Protest Bridal Bribery

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Associate Editor

A small group of predomin-
antly University women protest-
ed the KQV Bridal Fair Saturday
and Sunday at the William Penn
Hotel and met with harried reac-
tion from radio and hotel person-
nel. The attendant women. how-
ever. were generally open-mind-
ed and willing at least to read a
prepared statement.

The protest centered on the ex-
ploitation aspect of the Fair.
which was intended to hook the fu-
ture brides on expendable appli-
ances and other commodities
which are supposedly necessary
to set up "good houskeeping.“ A
statment distributed prior to the
Fair sessions read:

“The people who have set up
this Fair assume that this preoc-
cupation with things, this consum-
erism, will not end with your wed-
ding day but that you will go to be-
come the consumer idea: ‘the
happy American housewife.’ They
seel you ranges and refrigerators,
electric blenders and persimmon
pots and pans, etc. You are ex-
pected to turn from one happy
whirl of wedding shopping into a
lifetime of blissful buying. Only
one lifestyle is presented here.
We take offense.”

side

some of the prison’s
staff and is trusted, that is, to a
certain degree, that being very
minute. That particular man
is not trusted anymore than the
next, but he is psychologically
led to believe so.

H And the conclusive explosion
is that — that man whothinks he
is trusted sooner or later sees
the light and is then torn more

than when he was a nothing. or
when he thought he was so.

Yes. its very hard to be a man
in a prison; its hard because
there is no opportunity to do so.

Critics will argue that if he’s
man, he will serve his time, get
out and won't come back. I say
to you Mr. and Mrs. Critic —
come in here and stay with us
for a while. Not a day or two
days or a month, but come in
here for a couple of years or
five or twenty. And when you
come please try to remain your
ol’ casual self. We know you
can.

You‘ll have to excuse us if we
sound a bit derogatory. but then
we forgot that men don‘t come
to prison - only convicts.

There is a common phrase in
prison.“ If you act like a man.
well treat you like one.“ The
absurdity of that phrase is to,-
tally unmentionable ’because the
whole prison program is design-
ed for youngsters. The best exam-
ple of the childish treatment is
when a man grown is told that

he cannot‘ go outside this week-

One of the organizers of the
protest reported that a group of
about eight women entered the
Fair with tickets after leafleting
outside: they were received with
management hostility and "police
harrassment“ which included
constant tailing by plainclothes
security guards and uniformed

police. Several times the women,

were ordered to leave.

The protest was not designed to
ridicule the wedding custom or to
urge the attendees to break their
engagements and join the move-
ment. Rather the point was to
expose the Fair as a manipulation
of the rites of marriage to con-
vince a woman that her measure
as a wife is determined by the
variety and novelty of things she
has around the house. ‘

The statement also dealt with
the lack of a “Groom Fair.“

“It is explicitly assumed-that
men would not be interested in
such an event. Why? To go one
step further, it is explicitly as-
sumed that men have more im-
portant things to think about. It is
obvious that exactly as many men
get married as women. Yet men
view their marriage as something
personal, that may or may not
happen to them. But it does not
affect their ultimate goals.”

     

end to play baseball because he
didn‘t make his bed properly.

lt’s not only absurd; it’s hid-
eious!

Of course. there are men who
will remain men. but for how
long‘? Perhaps a man will shrug
off the adolescent procedures and
smile to himself because he
knows he is a man and he pro-
bably used the same procedure
with his children. But for how
long‘?

We think that if the judicial
bodies want to lower the crime

rate. they had better take a long

look inside the prison walls. It
has already been affirmed that
prisons are turning out worse
men than when they entered.
But what is being done about
it‘? Have you ever thought about
treating men as men‘?

Class Solidarity
Devlin Verbiage

Editor, The Pitt News

It has indeed disappointing to
learn of the appearance of Bern-
adette Devlin at the campus of
the University of Pittsburgh re-
cently.

Miss Devlin admits that one of
the purposes for her trip to the
United States is to convince Am-
ericans of the need for a work-
ing class solidarity and a social-
ist revolution.

She is calling for a “system
whereby workers control the fac-
tories and students control the

colleges.“ She sees the move-
ment of working class politics in
a relationship to the struggle of
the peoples of South America
and Vietnam, and of the people
of the Americas.

After the socialist revolution
was accomplished in Russia and
Cuba, thereby placing the com-
munists in power, students,
workers and others who helped
the communists come to power
where executed. In Germany,
they were shot when they tried
to escape over the Berlin Wall.

Students should ask Miss Dev-
lin if that is what she has in
mind for Americans who help in
the takeover. They should ask
her if she will denounce the
Soviet Criminal Code. article 70.
as being the enemy of the stud-
ent and academic community
because of its oppressive restric-
tions against criticizing the gov-
ernment.

Ideological Ju-jitsu Using an

Institution To

The Editor, The Pitt News, ‘

I am replying to Frank Little’s
letter in The Pitt News of Feb.
17.

Although he criticized Frank
Donatelli’s column (on politics
and the financial problems of
higher education, The Pitt News,
Feb. 10), my views should be
sufficiently congruent with Mr.
Donatelli’s that my remarks
should be to the point.

1. Although I object to public
education, I do not feel incon-
sistent in attending Pitt. For one
thing. one’s choice of school de-
pends on many factors, of which
tuition and state-relatedness are
but two. More important, I am
a radical and like all good radi-
cals I believe in ‘ideological ju-
juitsu' — using the system to de-
stroy itself.

That is, I am here to study in
the hope of developing arguments
to persuade people to get rid of
public education and put it
where it belongs: on, or at least
closer to, the free market.

2. Little has apparently been
reading Marcuse, for like him,
he simply asserts, without any
attempt to argue or cite evidence.
He calls Mr. Donatelli a racist.
but gives us nothing to sub-stan-
tiate this charge. Then he states
that ‘. . . Donatelli is . . . inter-
ested only in . . . profitsl. He
doesn't seem to give a damn
about the people.‘

Now how does anyone who be-
lieves in the free market make
profits without helping people?

 

Destroy Itself

ft‘

And who are the people? Com-
munists like Little? Perhaps his
anger is a result of the realiza-
tion that if education is divorc-
ed from politics — if people are
forced to pay for their educa-
tions — then the university will
no longer be able to be used by
the likes of Mr. Little as a breed-
ing ground for a communist re-
volution.

3. Why shouldn't a person
burden himself with a debt to
get an education‘? A mortgage on
a house can- easily cost more
than $20,000 and take twenty
years to pay off, but lots of peo-
ple buy houses. Why not educa-
tion too? Lots of people do it-
myself included.

The alternative——frequently for-
gotten by communists e is to put
the burden on someone else.
and this is a gross violation of
rights, given that the student has
the opportunity to put himself
through.

Little writes that ‘Toensure
maximum freedom of choice and
to guarantee the highest quality
of education, the state should
simply pay the tuition and liv-
ing expenses of each of its citi-
zens . . .’ But first. there is no
guarantee that such a plan would
have these results; I would argue
that the results would be just the
opposite.

Also, Little contradicts him-
self, for he earlier complains
about the dangers of the state
‘controlling the lives‘of unfor-
tunate borrowers‘.

I 1

 

Furthermore, the state does
not pay for anything (unless it is
identified with ‘the people’, as
communists think it should); be-
cause the state has no assets oth-
er than what the taxpayers give
it—-or what it takes from them-
it is ultimately the people who
P3)’-

Remember that state-supported
schools are regressive — i.e.,
they hit the poor hardest. Tax-
ing the rich won’t help. Besides
violating their rights — yes, Lit-
tle, even the rich have rights —
the rich just aren’t that rich.

And when their money is gone,
who will pay? And who will

have the incentive to become
rich in sucha confiscatory so-
ciety? (And where will business
get its capital for research and
expansion — i.e., providing new
jobs?)

There are lots of alternatives
to Little’s communistic scheme.
There is the plan mentioned by
Donatelli, there is a voucher sys-
tem, Yale’s PAYE plan, long-term
loans, private scholarships. etc.
Finally, I highly recommend to.
Little and the rest of your read-
ers Mr. Tonsor’s article on this
subject in the current (Winter
1971) issue of Modern Age.

Fitness for Disabled

(Editor's Note: The following
statement was released by Rich-
ard Miller, instructor in Physi-
cal Education, Health and Safe-
ty Education here.)

The physical education de-
partment is making an effort to
inform those members of the Un-
iversity family (students, staff
and faculty) who may have
some type of existing disability
and who may not presently be
engaging in courses offered by
the physical education depart-
ment or other recreational pur-
suits. ~

Physical education and recrea-
tion are vitally important to all
of us. They serve as whole-
some alternatives to the pres-
sures of college life, afford op-
portunities to make new friends,
develop physical fitness, and
provide just plain fun.

Being fit can give you an in-
creased feeling of energy, great-
er work capacity, better resis-
tance to illness, a more pleasing
appearance, and in the long run

help in sure a longer. happie'
and more productive life.

Although fitness is so impor-
tant, it is all too often neglec?-
ed. Many reasons account for
this: previous experience with
unenjoyable, unmeaningful pro-
grams, lack of information re-
garding what really is availa-
ble, mechanical difficulties such
as transportation for wheel
chair patients, and a lack of un-
derstanding as to the importance
are just a few.

The evidence of this neglect
may be reflected in the earl»;
mean age of America’s fatal car-
diacs forty-three.

The more inactive you are thr
more you need physical activa-
ty. No one is spared from the dc -
terioration that results from sec-—
entary living and with rare ex-
ceptions no one is disabled to
the point where a personal pr(-
gram cannot be developed to
meet his individual needs and lit 3

Social Commission Acts

YMCA Helps Retarded

T1/U0 ’°Weekends” Axed Through Transition

by TOM HEIPLE

In a meeting last week, the
Student Affairs (SA) Social Com-
mission formally abolished Win-
ter Weekend and Parent’s Week-
end because of a lack of interest.

The committee also discussed
the possibility of either raising the
activities fee from eight to ten
dollars or cutting off funds from
some student organizations to
provide enough money for next
year’s tentatively scheduled so-
cial events.

According to Lenny Klavonic,
the Social Commission intends to
make the activities fee more of
“a reality thing” by channeling
more of the money back to the stu-
dent through dances, movies with
no admission charge and big name
groups for concerts. In the past it
has been used almost entirely to
support over 50 student organiza-
tions which Klavonic feels bene-
fits only a minority of the stud-
dents.

Klavonic -cited student organ-
izations with only 20 members
and a $2,000 budget as being the
most likely to have their funds
reduced or cut off. Klavonic point-

ed out that the $2,000 could bring
in more than 20 groups for dances.

Justifying a possible increase
in the activities fee, Klavonic ex-
plained that the University “has
one of the four lowest activities
fees in the nation.” The average
is usually $25 to $50 per term
which explains why a lot of small-
er colleges are consistently able
to bring in better groups.

Another possibility the Commis-
sion is checking, involves having
an alumni group or some other
University affiliated organization
take over the responsibility of
funding a particular student group.

Klavonic said the Social Com-
mission believes “Homecoming
is the biggest event this Universi-
ty can have.” He stated that $40,-
000 has been allocated to provide
for a Friday and Saturday night
concert next year. For Friday
night either Three Dog Night, the
Moody Blues or Jefferson Air-
plane are being considered. On
Saturday either the Fifth Dimen-
sion or the Jackson Five would be
featured, possibly with Roberta
Flack.

Klavonic explained that to
bring in a group like Chicago,
which the Social Commission is
considering, cost roughly $25,000
for everything; group, rental fees,
agent’s fees, etc.

At four dollars per ticket, a full
house at the Syria Mosque would
bring in $15,000, leaving a $10,-
000 deficit the Commission would
have to cover. "“We don’t have a
big enough facility to bring a
group in and charge two dollars a
ticket,” he explained.

_ FORMER volunteers to VISTA,

by LORETTA HORRELL

The University’s YMCA has
been instrumental in helping to
socialize mentally retarded adults
in the Pittsburgh area.

The program, Project Transi-
tion, works in conjunction with
Transitional Services of Pitts-
burgh.

Transition is a new approach to
treating mental illness and re-
tardation. It is a program based
on a reality principle. The resi-
dent must become involved with

' activities in the home and com-

munity, gradually. He learns like
a child——the older he becomes, the
more complex life becomes.

Sixteen volunteers and group
coordinator, Maria Fusco, go
twice a week to help institution-
alized mentally retarded adults,
referred to as residents, in their
transition.

The transition is a gradual
adaptation to community living
while residing in supervised
homes and apartments. The vol-
unteer can help in this important
“transition” by first being a
friend, and secondly,by helping
the resident learn the skills that
are necessary for him to function
as an independent individual in
the Gbmmunity.

The goals of the program are
for the benefit of both the resi-

dent and volunteer. Besides
teaching the residents basic
skills, such as writing one’s name
or counting change, the volunteer
also provides a model of socially
appropriate behavior that would
help residents in his interaction
with others.

The program also helps the vol-
unteer to gain insight into the di-
verse needs and abilities of the
mentally retarded in the commun-
ity.

The project seeks to bring about
a change in society’s view of the
mentally retarded by demonstrat-
ing that these individuals can be
creative and productive.

The residents, who range in age
from 18-40 years and show desire
and ability to learn, are taken
from the institution to a half-way-
house, Highland Center.

Relocating the residents to
Highland Center is the first ma-
jor step in the transition. Here
they are treated like adults. It is
a group learning process teach-
ing social skills that are needed to
find and maintain jobs.

If the resident has shown im-
provement, he is transferred to
Negley Center, an apartment
complext with apartments that
house four to five residents. They
are expected to cook meals, bud-
get money, do laundry and hold
jobs.

The follow-up apartment, Pen-

confidence  

lt’ll help you through exams,
speeches, class recitations
and even just being with your
friends. It's something every
girl needs. One way to be
confident is with Tampax
tampons.

Internally worn Tampax
tampons can keep you
cool and calm even
when you're the center
of attention. They can’t show
or chafe or cause odor like
‘sanitary napkins. They're
softly compressed and highly
absorbent for protection you
candepend on.

And one more important
fact. Tampax tampons were
developedby a doctor so you
know you can trust them.
Even if you've just begun to
menstruate.

Confidence has made
Tampax tampons the best-
selling tampons in the world.
And that confidence can
make things easier for you.

Environmental Plans

by SUE HOENSTINE

If Pennsylvania Governor Mil-
ton Shapp’s tax package is pass-
ed, Environmental Action - Zero

Population Growth (EA/ZPG) may

enjoy increased support from the
State.

Last Thursday the new Gov-
ernor keynoted a conference
sponsored by The Pennsylvania
Environmental ‘ Council (PEC)
and The Environmental Planning
and Information Center (EPIC),
in Philadelphia. I

In his address, Shapp announc-
ed the formation of a Depart-
ment of Environmental Resourc-
es. Members of all socio-econo-
mic groups will be represented
on the committee, and the Gov-
ernor predicted that the new de-
partment will take a firm stand
on issues related to the Com-
monwealth’s resources.

Marc Hiller, coordinator of
Pitt’s EA/ZPG chapter, attended
the two-day conference and voic-
ed his support of the Governor’s
tax package.

“I’m very optimistic about the
goal he’s (Shapp) set,” Hiller
commented. “And it can be ac-
complished if the Department of

. Environmental Resources is will-

ing to step down hard on en-
vironmental polluters.”

Dr. Marilyn Goldsmith and
Maurice Shapiro, both of the
Graduate School of Public
Health, and Mrs. Ellen Jane Do-

nahoe of Planned Parenthood ac-
companied Hiller. All four attend-
ed sessions with a population
task__force that outlined plans
for future population control in
the State.

Hiller also stated that the Go-
vernor voiced his opposition to
the controversial P Supersonic

Racism Explored In

by CINDY MORGAN

What began as a frustrating
attempt to construct black—white
dialogues on an adult level has
found much more response and
success on a high—school level. _

Project Coliloquy, headed by
Bob Chmielewski and Sue Gates
of the Pitt YMCA, is develop-
ing a, program on racism which
they hope to present to members
of predominently white com-
munities. They believe that the
most viable method of attacking
racism is by working with youth
in these communities.

Project Coliloquy began as
black—white dialogues. These
programs failed because they
could not develop any interest
among blacks who were aware
of the program.

The Projects directors then
switched to having adult pro-

University is such a void on
weekends for social activity,”
said Lederman. “The movies
provide a place for fun, inex-
pensively. Actually, the Friday
night movies are an apology for
the nightlife of the city.”

“The profits made thus far,”
said Klavonic, “will be used to
pay for future movies. We in-
tend to show movies free of
cost at the end of the term, start-
ing in the latter half of March.”

Reacting to suggestions made
by students, Klavonic has decid-
edto vary the movies for the
remainder of the term. This
weeks movies are I Love You,
Alice B. Toklass, Cat Ballou, and
Viva Max. The following week,
The Silencers, Psycho, and Mur-
derer’s Row are scheduled.

grams in such communities as
Mt. Lebanon. But these, too,
were frustrating. “It was a no-
where thing because the adults
who came were backslapping lib-
erals,” said Chmielewski. “At
least they thought they were
liberal.”

Now the program begins with
a film, such as Black and White:
Uptight , shown to high school
students. After the movie, the
students break into small groups,
and.a “Y” ‘leader serves as a fa-
cilitator who prompts questions
about the social issues brought
up by the film.

The facilitator serves as just
that ——- he donates his insight but
gives no opinions, allowing’ the
students _to form their own re-
sponses.

Films such as these are used
not only to show incidents of
racial confrontation, but also to
show racial “myths” as they
occur everyday.

The project has found itself
faced with many problems. The
first, and perhaps an obvious
one, is that the people who par-

Lederman, who set up the ca-
shier system at the stage en-
trance door of Lawrence Hall,
feels that “it was a physical im-
possibility” to admit people
through the mail lobby. “The
stage entrance is the only way
to enter in a safe and financially
efficient manner,” said Leder-
man. “We’ve had 100% collection
using the side entrance.”

Lederman also attributed the
profit to the aid of the campus
police. In accordance with Uni-
versity procedures, three campus
policemen must remain on the
premises during the movies.
“The police don’t hassle the
kids,”, said Lederman. “In fact,
they enjoy the movies, too.”

Klavonic hopes to coordinate ‘

his film program with other
groups, such as the Franklin
Pang Born Film Club in the fall.
Klavonic thinks that by joining
forces, a larger variety and num-
ber of films can be shown in the
fall.

Colloquy

ticipate in these discussions
are already relatively “liberal.”
The directors would like to de-
vise a project which would allow

them to encounter the overt 'ra-  .,

cist.

White students have also ex-
pressed their interest in having
black students involved in their
discussions. Many of the whites
have never really had an oppor-
tunity to talk with a black, and
they feel it would be good to
have black input to give them a
clearer View of racial problems.

The “Y” is presently trying
to integrate Project Coliloquy
with a “Y” black program such
as Project Engineering.

Chmielewski finds that dealing
with young people is more ef-
fective than dealing with adults.
“We have one less gap to bridge”
he said. “And by taking our pro-
gram to fairly middle-class
schools, we also find it easier to
communicate to people with sim-
ilar backgrounds. If we attempt-
ed to work in an area with a
great deal of high-school drop-
outs, there would be a great deal
of alienation. We would have
to live in the community for ‘a
long time and get to know all the
problems before we would be
trusted.”

 

VIVA Max, ILove You, Alice B.
Toklas and Cat Bollou will be
presented from midnight to
5 a.m. Friday, March 5, in I20
David Lawrence Hall. The films
are sponsored by Student Gov-
ernment and admission is 50¢.

JERRY MYERS
Associate Sports Editor

(Editor’s Note: This letter was received in the mail last week. A re-
sponse follows.)

Dear Mr. Myers.

In your column. “Home Stretch“ «Feb. 17». you stated that
Buzz Ridl “has molded a squad that now rivals Duquesne as the
top basketball team in the city.

How by any stretch of the imagination could _vou suggest
that Pitt is approaching the level of the Dukes. Granted your re-
markable Steel Bowl upset is an indication that Panther round-
ball is on the rise but there are other considerations.

1) Compare the attendance figures of the Arena and the
House.

3) Check any and all ratings. I don’t see Pitt anywhere.

3) Check the amount of newspaper space and radio and TV
time alloted the Dukes compared to the Panthers.

You went on to discuss the
prospects for a winning sea-
son and quoted Ridl as saying.
“Now we just have to stay in
there and play good ball.“ Of
course! If the last part of the
Dukes schedule included play-
ing both Westminster and (‘-
MU twice they would wind up
over .500 playing four men.

I‘--llllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll

We've had our Cleveland States and Roanokes but Pitt has
played no one the stature of Yillanova. LaSalle. Western Ken-
tucky. St. Bonaventure. Notre Dame. etc.

In the past several “Duke“ writers have been less than kind
toward basketball but we have never printed the kind of out-
rageous garbage as this column. If you have to fill up space,
why not use pictures or wire service and not lower the reputa-
tion of your fine newspaper.

—-Dave Morris. Assistant Sports Editor

>l< * *

I regret. Mr. Morris. that your extreme loyalty to the Du-
quesne Dukes forces you to reach so vehemently to a simple
comparison of your team and then drives you to distort the con-
tent of the comparison.

I never said. and hardly could with any credibility. that the
Pitt Panthers are better. or even as good as Duquesne. I mere-
ly stated that. as a result of the victory in the Steel Bowl and
some impressive showings since. the Panthers have shown that
they have what it takes to displace the Dukes as the city‘s top
basketball school.

Allow me to stretch your imagination a bit. You are aware,
I'm sure that Duquesne is losing three seniors after this sea-
son, the Nelson Twins and Jarrett Durham. The freshman
squad, which has had a decent year, is not a good as it was her-
alded to be—and was thrashed handily by the Panther Cubs
twice. The Panthers on the other hand will have the cream of
this Pitt freshman squad (12-4) to work with, in addition to
Billy Night and Cleve Edwards (back from a knee injury). Tak-
ing all of this into consideration, it is not beyond the relm of
possibility that the Panthers put an end to the Duquesne dynasty
in Pittsburgh college basketball, and soon.

I'd be interested to know. since when has television time.
newspaper space and attendance been a criterion in judging how
good a team is‘? Besides that. I dare say. the Arena provides a
little more attractive drawing card for local fans than the Field
House does. And even with that. Pitts attendance has been up by
a tremendous amount over the last couple years as opposed to
a stagnation in the Duquesne support. Dealing with the press.
the Panthers have to contend with the fact that are an up—and-
coming team while Duquesne is the established basketball
school

And in final defense of the column you described as “gar-
bage.“ I‘d like to bring to your attention the fact that Pitt has
played some pretty decent schools itself this year. These in-
clude Fordham. I)avi_dson. North Carolina State. not to mention
UCLA and. of course. I)uquesne. These somehow approach the
“stature“ you desire.

Granted. the Panthers haven't arrived yet, and the Dukes
are playing the best ball they have played in a long time. But
the end of Duquesne basketball supremacy is in sight. and it
may even be terminated by the Panthers as early as next year.

* It! It

Supposedly. Pitt gained the most exposure they’ve had this
year last Saturday afternoon when they battled Penn State in the
l<3CA(? Game of the Week. The viewing audience was greatly
diminished. though. by the fact that Pitt-PSI? had to compete
with the .\'(?.-\.-\ Game of the Week. which began one-half hour
prior to the Panther contest.

The NCAA game. televised by TVS. featured two nationally
ranked teams in Jacksonville and Houston. The game. at Hous-
ton. was won by the home team. 83-82.

Meet At Penn State

By STEVEN WILLIAMS

The Penn State Nitnany Lions were too much for the gymnas-
tics team Monday night at University Park. Pa. PSU downed the

Pitt team. 156.05 - 136.30.

Pitt had some good moments in the loss.

Lowell Meek. the defending Eastern champion in the free exer-
cise. extended his undefeated skein to eleven matches this season by
winning the free exercise event with a score of 9.35 points.

Dick Pribis of Pitt fought for
third place as his team establish-
ed a lead of two points at the
end of his event. W

The team continued to lead
the awesome Lions after the side
horse event.

Mike Beatty came through with
one of his best routines of the
season. scoring 8.80 points and
taking second place behind PSU‘s
Bill Murphy in the side horse.

Phil Lilly. who competed in
four events. followed Beatty in
third place with an 8.40.

The Pitt team managed to in-
crease their lead over the Nit-
nany Lions to more than two
points when the side horse event
was completed.

Jim Bilec ended his Pitt car-
eer with his highest score on
the still rings (8.85 points) but

Seek Revenge  

°Ga1°l)age’ Loss

Ha 1' riso 11.
Listed As
Doubtful

by MARTY HELLM AN

The Panther basketball team
has the opportunity to avenge

last months heart-breaking loss _
to the West Virgina Mountaineers '

tonight at 8 p.m. at the brand new
WVU Coliseum in Morgantown.

It will be the next to last game '

for both squads. as Pitt meets
Georgia Tech and WVU opposes
Virginia 'l‘ech in finales Saturday.
In the first meeting between the
two teams. the Mountaineers nip-
ped the Panthers 95-91 in what

many Pitt fans will remember as '

"the garbage game." Two tech-
nical fouls called on the crowd at
the Field House aided the Moun-
taineers and hindered the Pan-
thers chance of pulling the game

out in the final minute. 

Since that meeting, Coach Son-
ny .M0ran's Mountaineers have
scored impressive wins and came
close to upsetting Notre Dame.
Their overall record stands at
11-11.

Four victories in that time span
for the Mountaineers were over
Davidson. VPI.
Maryland.

In all of those games. except‘

for the Maryland one. WVI' scor-
ed over 90 points. thereby upping
their game average to over 90
mark.

Will Robinson, the Mountain-
eers‘ sensational junior. guard,
continued to be the team’s lead-

Penn State and .

ing scorer with a 25 points per _

Penn
in 45

game average. Against
State, Robinson poured
points.

In the Maryland upset. sopho-
more Levi Phillips led the sqad
with 26 points. the highest out-‘
put of his short varsity career.

Panther Coach Bu’/.2 Ridl ad-.
mits that WVU‘will be hard to
beat. “With the way that they
have been playing. it adds up to
a pretty good ball game." he said.

Ridl hopes to control the WVU
offense better this times. “They

scored too much on us last time, - '

and we're going to have to try and
hold them down,” he continued.
“We just can‘t run with them and
can't match their speed and high‘
scoring."

Besides missing Mike Paul in

the lineup due to his ankle injury _

of two weeks ago. ltidl may not
have the services of Buzzy Harri-
son for the first time this season.

In the final minutes of Satur-
days Penn State game. Harri-
son also injured his ankle and Hidl
lists Bu’/.'/.y‘s status as “question-
able."

Since Buzzy has replaced Paul’
in the lineup as a starter, he has
led the squad in scoring in both
the Westminister and Penn State
games.

In case Harrison is unable to
play tonight. Ritll plans to start
either senior Mike Riggle or Bob
(‘izmarik at the
position.

Since the llrst W\'l’ game. the
Panthers have won five while los-
ing one. Their seasons record is
currently 14-8.

Fresh Gunning
For 13th Win

by JERRY MYERS
Associate Sports Editor

Gunning for their 13th victory of the year, the Panther Cubs bat-
tle the Little Mountaineers of West Virginia in their last game of the

1970-71 campaign.

The Cubs, now 12-4 on the season, have a return bout against the
WVU frosh tonight in the front end of a Pitt-Mountaineer double-header
from the West Virginia Coliseum starting at 6 p.m.

The Little Mountaineers, a team that won four of their first five

games this has been severely han-
dicapped as they come down the
home stretch. The day before the
last Pitt-WVU confrontation, one
of West Virginia‘s four scholar-

‘ship freshmen, 6-9 center Bob

Hornstein, broke his collarbone in

“mainder of the season.

Have Chance,

2 She Thought

By JANICE BUCCIGROSSI

Four years ago Elaine Kingas
had no chance of making the
women‘s varsity basketball team
at Pitt. So she thought.

Today she is a four year cage
veteran and a co—captain of the
team.

“When I came to Pitt I didn‘t
even know there was a‘ basket-
ball team." related Elaine. “.1
saw some signs and posters
around about the team. but I
didn‘t think I was‘ good enough
to play. I tried out anyway and
made it."

Elaine’s first experience at
playing on an organized team
came when she started at Pitt.
Before then, she had only parti-
cipated in neighborhood games,
beginning when she was nine

(Cozitiizzzrzl on Par/e 11)

CL

“Bob has good defensive anti-
cipation and a good ability to block
shots,” said Winsor before his
squad took on the Ohio State
Frosh. “Without him in there,
we cannot be quite as aggressive
as a team on defense as before.”

Accenting his outside shooting,
Winsor goes to his leading scorer
John Vidovich. Vidovich exploded
for 25 points against the Panther
Cubs on Feb. 3 in a losing cause.
The Little Mountaineers were
clobbered by Pitt in that contest.
90-25.

Bernie Kirchner. Charlie Hick-
ox and Mark Catlett comprise the
bulk of WVU‘s scoring punch,
along with Vidovich. They now
stand 5-5 on the season, losing to
Ohio State, 93-75, the night after
the Pitt game, dropping a decision
to Cincinnati a week later, down-
ing Penn State and Losing to the
Maryland frosh.

Tonight’s game is the last one
of the season for both freshman
squads. Pitt has a chance to bow
out with a nine game winning
streak. The last time the Cubs
dropped a game was to the Robert
Morris Colonials on Jan. 30.

Mickey Martin, who had 31
points against the Little Moun-
taineers the last time the two
teams met. is leading the Cubs in
scoring. He‘s followed by center
Jim Bolla, Sam Flemming, and
Gary Pagano.

Pitt Coach Tim Grgurich, who
has been absent from the last
Cub contest against PSU. will be
back on the coaching lines.

As the curtain decends on the
wrestling stage, Dave Wylie finds
he is the only actor who hasn‘t
“broken a leg,” and he wonders if
he can survive his last bow, the
tournaments.

“I’ve had a few bumps and
bruises,” says the Pitt grappler,
“but not enough to keep out of the

‘L line-up. ’

“The other guys have had to
suffer all season long. Maybe I’ll
get mine in the last match.”

With only the tournaments re-
maining on the grapplers sched-
ule, Dave looks ahead with mixed
emotions.

As far as his personal success
is concerned, he hopes to top his
previous fourth place in the
Easterns and go on to the Nation-
als.

He doesn’t feel that the East-
erns will be less important this
year despite a new qualifying sys-
tem for the NCAA’s.

“The Easterns are just as im-.

portant. I hope to do just as well
as last year and hopefully do bet-

. ter.”

The new qualifying system
will provide problems, however.
Under the old system a wrestler
had to maintain a certain win-
ning percentage and place in the
Easterns.

Now a qualifying tournament
will be held prior to the National.

tionals are really getting big and
they have to cut down the num-
ber of wrestlers.”

The coming matches provide
some disappointment. however. in
light of the fantastic amount of
injuries which has left the mat-
men only three of ten original
starters in the line-up.

“We were expecting this to be

the year, theyear that we were
going to get even,” Wylie states.

  
  

“We were going to get back at
‘Navy. Penn State beat us by one
point last year and we were going
to get even with them too.”

“We were eighth in the Nation
last year and we wanted to do bet-
ter. We were looking for the big
year.” ‘

“The big year" is over, and
Dave Wylie just hopes he can get

past the injury jinx into the (fir

tournaments.

Icers in High Scoring Game

Wednesday,‘ March 3, 1.971-THE PITT NEWS—Page 11

Pitt’s Tom Lang (left photo) removes the puck from the net in the Icers game against North Park Sunday after he assisted teammate Mike

Petley (I4) who fires away for the score (at right).

Maple Leafs Tie Pitt
011 Mackin °Triek’

by STEVE ZYCH

In a game which featured several fights. some freaky goals and
vicious checking. the Pitt Ice Hockey Club battled the North Park Ma-
ple Leafs to a hard-fought 6-6 deadlock Sunday night at the Alpine Ice

Chalet.

After a scoreless first period Dickie Moore of North Park opened
the scoring with a breakaway goal at the 18:14 mark’ of the second per-
iod. Less than a minute later tempers began to flare and within seconds

a full-scale fight broke out in-
volving Pitt's Brown brothers and
North Parks Stein and Mike
Mackin.

The fracas seemed to fire—up
the aroused Pitt skaters as they
began to pressure the enemy net.
At 13:24 their efforts were re-
warded with a goal by Dick Van
Antwerp who backhanded Duke
Schaeffer’s rebound into the net. .

The next goal was unusual.
North Park’s Hinkele and Mentz
were coming in on Pitt’s Joe Tes-
ta when all of a sudden Hinkele let
loose a long flip shot over Testa’s
head which took a crazy bounce
and eluded a startled Mark Lieb-
erman, the Pitt goalie.

The Maple Leafs went on to
score again at 1:29 when Mike
Mackin scored the first of his
three goals on a breakaway. The
goal was a shorthanded one as
Dave Troy was serving a two min-
ute minor penalty for high stick-
ing.

Less than a minute later. Pitts
Dick Solberg closed the gap to
one goal as he faked both Mackin
and North Park. goalie Hartman
and fired the puck into the empty
net to make it 3-2 and end the
scoring for the second period.

The third period saw the Pitt
icers come out with the pressure
on goalie Hartman and at 16:41 of
the third period Bill Glenville
fired the puck into the lower right
hand corner after receiving a per-
fect pass from Testa.

At 13:24 North Park's Steve
Klenz. who had been "illegally"
checking and tripping Pitt's high
scorer Glen Hyde the whole game.
was finally caught for tripping
the big and burly defenseman. It
took the ‘team only 23 seconds to
score on the power play and put
Pitt ahead for the first time in
the game. 4-3.

The lead was shortlivcd. how-
ever. as 46 seconds later North
Parks Mackin tied the game
when he rammed home a loose

puck between the legs of Pitt
goalie Lieberman.

The game stayed that way until
9:43 when Mike Petley hit the up-
per right hand corner of the net.
He was set up by Hyde and Tom
Lang. It was the first of his two
goals as Petley struck again two
minutes later to make it 6-4 on an
unassisted breakaway goal.

Again the lead proved to be
shortlived as North Park struck
twice within two minutes to knot
the game at 6-6 on goals by Stein
and Mackin. The tying goal was
Mackins third of the game-the
hockey "hat trick."

The Pitt skaters. now 2-0-1. face
the Pittsburgh Knights next Sun-
day at 7:15 p.m. at the Alpine
Ice Chalet. Admission will again

al program in high school.

Outside of the regular season.
Elaine still spends time on the
basketball court. This summer.
as in the past two. she will be
a basketball counselor for one
week at Red .Vlanning's Basket-
ball Camp. Her teammate Phyl-

some counseling.

Elaine is also a four year
member of the women‘s volley-
ball team and has been a mem-
ber of the tennis team for the
two years that it has been in
existence.

“All the sports made Pitt-really
worthwhile for me,” she said.

“I‘ve taken up tennis and
skiing. however. because they are

more individual sports. and they‘

have more future value for me."
explained Elaine. “It's easier to

find a tennis partner than to-

try and find enough girls to play
a game of basketball with."

The Pitt captain is a senior bi-
ology major and next year will

attend the Pitt Medical School.‘

Elaine would like. however. to
maintain some contact with bas-
ketball.

She related,
time I'd like to continue to play
basketball for as long a time as
possible. I might be able to do
this through the Ormsby Tourna-
ment — a tournament whose par-

ticipants are indipendent teams’

in the Tri-State area.”

Elaine is looking forward to
Wednesday nights home game
against West Liberty. "1 hope
it's a good game. Most of the
games we play are no challenge."

"Being and working on a
team is an experience in itself."
she stated. “I feel those who are
not in sports miss out on alot. I
know I really enjoyed playing
basketball.

"I got to meet alot of people.
and I got to travel. I‘ve played
for four years and I only wish
I had four more."
