Students speak out against funding cut

Michael Macagnone
News Editor

Proposed state budget cuts that
would cause Pitt’s tuition to rise

sparked an outcry among students, .

administrators and legislators over
spring break.

The cuts, part of Gov. Tom
Corbett’s ﬁrst budget, amount to
almost $900 million in education
spending and wouldreduce Pitt’s

$185 million appropriation by‘

more than half, to $80.2 million.

State legislators will hold hearings A

on the budget throughout April,
before setting a date to vote on
it. '

Accounting for inﬂation, the

appropriation —which accounted
for 9 percent of Pitt’s budget this
year—- would be the smallest Pitt
has received since becoming state-
related in the 1960s. And Pitt will
also lose more than $10 million in
federal funds this coming year.
Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
said during a news conference last
week that Pitt would deﬁnitely

have to increase tuition if the cuts . »

pass, but it will try to keep those in-
creases in “manageable ranges.”

Nordenberg said it was too ear-
ly to know what programs would
be affected by the cut, though the
University would look to every
program for cuts. It will attempt
to avoid layoffs, he said.

Student Government Board
president Molly Stieber said the
proposed cuts were by no means
a shock.

“Its what the governor cam-
paigned on,” she said, adding
that she hopes students will rally
against them. “We still have time
to show Harrisburg how we feel
about this,” Stieber said. .

Students react to proposed
cuts "

Though the University was still
on break when the news broke, a
number of students, administra-
tors and legislators across the state
have already joined to oppose the
cuts. Much of the opposition has
lined up on Facebook and other
websites.

The most proliﬁc social me-
dia outcry was one started by Pitt

senior Nick Brink. The neurosci-
ence major launched the “GOV
CORBETT 50% Appropriation
Reduction for Higher Education
— UNACCEPTABLE” Facebook
event hours after Corbett’s budget
proposal Tuesday.

Reaching beyond Pitt to stu— \

dents at Penn State, Temple and
Lincoln universities —— which also
receive money from the «state as
an incentive to keep tuition lower
for in-state students — and the 14
state-run universities, the event
has become a center for people op-
posing the proposed cuts.

What started with a few ‘dozen
invites to friends at Pitt became
some 5,000 across the state by
midday Wednesday, and more than
60,000 by Sunday.

Nick Brink: ,

though it would only be one part
of the coalition’s opposition of the
budget. She said she was working
with University ofﬁcials to coordi-
nate protests of the cuts.

Pitt had prepared for some
funding loss; it launched a website
immediately after the announce-
ment that touted the University’s
achievements and effect on the

. community. In an e—mail sentto

parents and students Tuesday,
Nordenberg called the cuts a “se-

vere and unfair burden on our stu— -

dents and their families.”

One initiative already in motion
is Pitt Day in Harrisburg on April 5,
which will provide an opportunity
for students, faculty, administra-
tors and alumni to meet with mem-

, bers of the Pennsylvania General

would be affected by the cuts, be— i

yond saying that there would be a
tuition hike. Penn State President
Graham Spanier said in a state-

ment Wednesday that the pro.--

posed cuts would likely force the
University to close some of its 19
branch campuses. '

Pitt spokesman John Harvith

saidthat the University does not .
plan to close any of the regional _

campuses if the cuts go through,
although he said that the Univer-
sity did. not have any details be—
yond that.

. In Corbett’s ﬁrst budget ad-
dress as governor, given Tuesday

” morning, the Republican said that

perennial tuition increases were
a sign that the current system for

funding higher education was not '

The deficit is a big deal and everyone
should tighten their belts. Although I    
feel like they have tightened the belts on

off the hook.

Comments on the page ranged
from paragraphs—long arguments
about the beneﬁts of education
to short collections of expletives.
The event page has also provided
a forum for comments from the
minority of users in favor of the
cuts.

’ Brink worked with student
leaders to develop a website for
the Coalition of Pennsylvania Stu-
dents —— organized and launched
in response to the cuts. The group
advocates for the 18 universities af-
fected by the cuts and links to a pe-
tition created by Pitt’s Graduate 8:
Professional Student Assembly.

GPSA President Nila Devanath
worked with Brink on the Face-
book event and helped launch the
petition, which is meant for all
students’ in the state.

The GPSA website also includes
a space that allows students to e-
mail their state legislators, their
parents’ legislators and Corbett’s
ofﬁce aboutthe issue.

Devanath said she would be
happy with 1,000 signatures,

Assembly. Last month, students
from the state-related schools
gathered in Harrisburg to raise
awareness about their universities
and their impact on surrounding
communities.

Oﬂicials from Pitt and the other
state-related universities will go in
front of the Appropriations Com-
mittee of the legislature on March
28 to advocate against the cuts.

Pennsylvania’s and Pitt’s budget
problems

It is unclear what effects that
the protests might have on the
potential cuts — and what effects
those cuts might have on Pitt stu-
dents, beyond tuition increases;

The proposedvbudget needs to

gain approval by the state legis-.

lature before becoming law; but,
both chambers are controlled by
Republicans, who in past years

have advocated for less state‘

spending.
Pitt officials have said it is too
early to say how the University

ightly and let other people

working. Pitt’s tuitionhas risen by
at least 2 percent for the past ﬁve

years, and went up by 5 percent

this year for in-state students.

“This ﬁscal crisis is a time to
rethink state spending on higher
education,” Corbett said. “Despite
state subsidies on higher educa-
tion, tuition has continued to in-
crease. If the intent was to keep
tuition rates down, we failed.”

In a statement issued with
the budget, Corbett said the cuts
were meant to hold universities
“accountable for spending’ and
performance.” -

His proposed budget did not
include any measures for reform
in higher education, such as in-
troducing merit pay or transpar-

ency measures, which Corbett did ’

propose for K-12” education.

The governor’s spokesman,
Kevin Harley, said this budget
would be the ﬁrst step in changing
the formula on funding for higher
education in the future. He said
that Corbett wanted to fund the
students rather than the institu-

tions, which he said have not been

. held accountable for yearly tuition .

increases.

“We had a $4.1 billion deﬁcit
to close. We have to ﬁnd money to
close that,” he said. “Pitt, Temple,
Penn State and Lincoln are going to
have to tighten their belts.” _

Harley said that Corbett wanted
to have money follow the students
to Various state institutions using
the Pennsylvania Higher Educa-
tion Assistance Agency, which pro-
vides’ scholarships and grants to
students from Pennsylvania. The
budget proposal called for a’ $30

million cut in that agency’s $440 .

million budget. ,
Corbett called the $27.'3 billion,
1,100-page proposal a “reality-

' based budget.” It includes no tax

increases — in line with his cam-
paign promises —+ and cuts state
spending to 2008 levels.

The budget proposal included
a number.of other initiatives, like
cutting the state’s capital and sup-
ply taxes and creating a task force
that would examine privatizing the
state’s liquor stores. It also includ-
ed a continuation of the ﬁlm tax
credit, which Corbett said would

’ help to bring j obs and money into

local economies. 2 ,
State Sen. Jay Costa, the Demo-

' cratic ﬂoor leader and a member

of Pitt’s Board of Trustees, said
that Democratshad a number of

.3 concerns about the budget. He said
5 in comments to the Pennsylvania
Cable Network, a nonproﬁt cable

television network, that the bud-
get cuts to higher education were
“draconian.” ‘ 5

“This budget is balanced on
the backs of working people,” he
said.

Corbett emphasized that the
budget is intended to rein in spend-
ing and balance the budget while
preventingtax increases.

Brink disagreed, though. He
said thatvalthough it is necessary
for some cuts to happen,_50 per-
centwas too much.

“The deﬁcit is a big.deal and
everyone should tighten their
belts,” he said. “Although I feel like

they have tightened the belts on .

students too tightly and let other
people off the hook.”

  Opinions

More tuition,
more problems

Pitt students graduating May 1
might feel lucky to escape tuition
increases due to proposed state
budget cuts. But we at The Pitt
News think the cuts will be harm-
ful to more than those with a bill
for next semester.

After Gov. Tom Corbett pro-
posed to reduce education funding
by almost $900 million last week
— slashing Pitt’s $167 million ap-
propriation by half '— Chancellor
Mark Nordenberg said Pitt will def-
initely have to increase tuition.

Though Pennsylvania’s eco-
nomic state requires budgetary
sacriﬁces, reducing education

funding by such a large amount .
in such a short period of time is '

irresponsible — especially when
other options have been left un-
touched and unexplored.

: For example, Pennsylvania
is the only big gas-drilling state
without a severance tax on natural
gas, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
reports. .

And although Corbett’s budget
painfully burdens higher educa-
tion seekers, this cut will undoubt-
edly impact more than just college
students and those who must fork
the money into Pitt’s salivating’
mouth. . .

Because an increase in tuition
is likely to encourage student loan
debt and discourage enrollment,
the city of Pittsburgh might be-
come a less attractive location for
companies and small businesses.

In addition, if Pitt sees a de-
crease in enrollment, the local

economy could suffer due to the
large spending role Pitt students
have. The $76.8 million in annual
discretionary spending Pitt stu-
dents contribute is no joke. On top
of that, Pitt is the sixth largest em-
ployer in the state, according to
the Pennsylvania Department of
Labor& Industry.

Though a tuition spike is a sure
thing — we estimated that it could
amount to an additional $4,000
per in-state student next year if

the University doesn’t cut in other —‘

areas — Pitt could additionally be
forced to eliminate other servic-

_ es, amenities and positions. The

Chancellor has not yet speciﬁed if
and where cuts will be made, but
with such extreme appropriation
cuts, almost everything seems in

_ jeopardy.

We ultimately think Corbett’s
severe cuts in higher education
funding were unwarranted and

V detrimental to the state’s economic

and intellectual health — especial-
ly since the budget does nothing to
beneﬁt higher education and only
servesto take from it. I
In addition, these cuts will
require that Pitt practice proper
transparency to assure its students
that raising tuition is the only op-
tion. , —

proposal should check out. coali-

A MIDWESTERN PIECE

‘Out with the old’
not always the best policy

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

 

The United States is a counuy inwhich
elected politicians are sworn in and
then cussed out. What’s remarkable
is not why people swear at them, but
rather to what federal officeholders

swear allegiance. They don’t swear an ‘

oathtothe people orto the nation. They
swear allegiance to the’ nation’s blue-
print—the Constitution ofthe United
States. The new Republican majorityin
the House thought it would be a good
ideato read the Constiuition aloud on
the ﬂoor to givethe representatives a
better idea of the oath they took.

One of the most bandied about
statements about the reading of the
Constitution on the ﬂoor of the House
came from blogger Ezra Klein of The
Washington Post who said the prob-
lem with the Constitution is that it

was written over 100 years ago, and -

consequently nobody really under-
stands it.

In Klein’s defense, he didn’t really A
say a lot of the things people have ac-
cusedhimofsaying. Buthe did saythat I

nobody can understand the Const:itu—
tion because it’s old. This is non sequi-
tur. People routinely read and under-
stand Shakespeare,whose workis400
years old and deliberately ambiguous.
Others puzzle out Geoffrey Chaucer,
whose work is so old he doesn’t really
spe “our” language.

Ultimately more important than a '

10—second soundbyteistheunderlying
disdain Klein demonstrated toward

things that seem ancient. This disdain ‘

has inﬁltrated our culture thoroughly:
Nobody wants yesterday’s computer,
cell phone or fashion statement. A
handy put-down is to say that some-
body’s outﬁt or outlookis “so lastyear.”
And yesterday’s fads don’t have much
staying power. Who ﬁghts over Beanie
Babies anymore? 1

And yet, we should not give up _on
the old so easily. The old stuff that is
still around has beneﬁtted from edit-
ing. Every era produces a lot of crap,
like the geocentric solar system model
or Microsoft Windows 95. The long
and thorough vetting process of time
ensures thatthis crap isforgotten and
the worthwhile stuff survives. We hail

the Romans as engineering geniuses,
which theywere. But our perception is
skewedbecause lousy Romanbuildings
fell down, burned orwere torn downas
eyesores. Whatwas leftwas abrilliant
series of aqueducts, roads and temples,
some of them still in use today.

OK, so the Romans came up with
concrete. But what about ideas? Here

_ too, old doesn’t mean worthless. Hu-

mans haven’t changed much in thou-
sands of years. The Ancient Israelites
would not understand cell phones, but
what they would understand is our

‘ envy of our neighbors better model,

ourwillingness to steal that model and
our obsessive following of celebrities

The Constitution itselfis a ﬁne ex-
ample of old ideas being good ideas.
What did the Framers seek to accom-
plish? The synthesis of all the best ideas
of government into one handy blue-
print. Did they pull it off? More or less.
What sorts of ideas did they follow?
Limited government, the separation of
powers and so forth. Have those ideas
been improved upon? Not really. Lirn—

ited government is stillrelevant, to all

sides ofthe political spectrum, whether
it’s the Patriot Act or Obamacare you
hate. I don’t see anybody advocating
the end of representation, much _as
people might hate our representa-

tives. Separation of power is likewise .

When We overcome this
disdain of old thin s, We
find that some of t e best
ideas are those which have

been considered good for

hundreds of years already. ‘

on Smartphones. Why did the Israel-
ites frown on envy, theft and idol wor-
ship? Because they understood them,
and understood that rampant theft,
murder, lying and envy weren’t good
for any neighborhood. The Ten Com-
mandments they accepted as a sort of
“dos and don’ ' ’ list have lost none of
their force or clarity in2,500 years.
We can also see the timelessness
of humanity and inhumanity in the
literature of the past. Medea was one
seriously ticked—off witch who could
probably have had a soap opera ofher
own. Antigone was trying to do the
rightthingindeﬁance ofvery, veryseri—
ous peer pressure. Shakespeare’s popu-
larity endures not because his works
are archaic but because they speak to

us. You canupdate Macbeth so thatthe

lines of Act H, Scene 1 read “OMG! Is
this adaggericb4 me?” But you won’t
improve upon the original play.

cherishedby whichever party happens
to be in the minority at the time.

Is the Constitution notunderstand-
able because of its age? Indeed, it is a
remarkably clear document. It’s short,
only4,400 words. Bills of attainder are
no good. Congress can’t take money
out of the Treasury without a publicly

, V available receipt If you hold ofﬁce,

nobody should give ahoot aboutyo
knowledge of theology. V
Whether it is constitutions, lit-
erature, engineering or music, we
are capable of understanding the old.
Old does not mean worthy of disdain,

_ impenetrable or worthless". When we

overcome this disdain of old things,
we ﬁnd that some of the best ideas
arethosewhichhavebeen considered
good for hundreds of years already.

THEATER PREVIEW

‘Shrek’ treks to ’Burgh singing new tunes

Courtesy Dreamworks Theatricals (Joan Marcus)

Alan Mingo Jr., who plays Donkey, has worked to make the memorable character true to the original without copying the much loved travel companion of the movie.

Staff Writer

“Shrek The Musical”
Tuesday - Sunday
Directed byjason
Moore

Alan Mingo Jr. spends several
hours a day surrounded by ogres,
a lord and a princess.

The actor plays Donkey in the
upcoming show “Shrek the Mu-
sical.” And from the beginning
of the role, that meant wearing
hooves on his hands.

“From the first rehearsal they
had me in hooves on my hands,”

Mingo said. “It changed things.
I’m used to having use of my
hands. Here in rehearsal they
had me wearing these hooves.
The actual costume is beautiful
and comfortable, but having the
hands covered was a struggle.
But by now it’s natural, which is
weird to say.”

Donkey accompanies Shrek,

the now—famous ogre, as he at—A

tempts to rescue a princess from
a tower in hopes of reclaiming
his swampy home.

“Shrek The Musical,” cur-
rently touring after its Broadway
run, reenacts the first movie in
the “Shrek” series, though there
are new plot twists and more
original music added. Just like
in the movie, there are moments
for children mixed in with adult
humor for older crowds.

The show’s creators,-David
Lindsay-Abaire for book and
lyrics and Jeanine Tesori for
music, expanded on the Duloc
welcoming song and kept “I’m a
Believer” at the end, but the rest
of the score is original.

But one of the biggest chal-
lenges that actors like Mingo
face is adapting a well—known
movie character for the stage in a
way that does justice to the origi-
nal — without copying it.

The solution for Mingo is
to be true to the character. He
doesn’t try to impersonate Eddie
Murphy, the voice of Donkey in
the movie, but instead he “does
what the character itself would
do.”

“It’s not vastly different,”
Mingo said. “You recognize the
donkey when you see and hear

him. But because the musical
takes place through the first
movie and we have other situ-
ations that didn’t happen in the
movie, once the audience rec-
ognizes him they go along with
the ride with me. The whole ob-
jective was you can’t go wrong
if you stay true to the Donkey’s
situation.”

Mingo’s no stranger to Broad-
way shows based on movies. He
has acted in “The Lion King” and
“The Little Mermaid,” but Don-
key brought in a new experience
for him because of the costume’s

. “practicality.”

“The costume pretty much
looks like a donkey,” Mingo said.
“I look like I’m in a suit giving
the shape of a donkey. It’s like
looking at a donkey staying on
his hind legs.’’

The Donkey costume is espe-
cially comfortable. There is ﬁsh-
net underneath that allows for
ventilation, making the costume
more practical than costumes
used in other shows.

Other costumes in the show
aren’t necessarily as easy to wear
as Donkey’s — the Shrek cos-
tume takes quite a bitof work.
Jorie Mars Malan, the make—up
assistant, specializes in the pros-

' thetics that are part of the Shrek

character make—up.

“Most shows only have one or
two [make-up artists], and most
shows only require hair and the
actors do their own make—up,”
Malan said. “This is just intense
and they can’t do it on their own
every day.”

costume alone takes 90 minutes '

to put together, Malan said. It
includes a bald cap with a face
opening, a latex foam piece that
covers the actor’s head and in-
cludes ears,and three silicone
pieces for his facethatvleave only

his eyes and mouth exposed;

. , .“Most of what goeslon his face
is glue. Then I paint everything
to blend the pieces. It’s amaz-

ing because those pieces once on -

‘ the male roles so he can “swing”

He’s also a dance captain respon-
sible for knowing and teaching
choreography for the show.
“Shrek’s costume and make-
up is genius. If you saw him up
close you would think he’s an
ogre,” McKnight said, recalling

a time he sent a photo to a friend
who didn’t recognize the person

underneath the make—up.

But well-constructed cos-
tumes don’t mean the actors
won’t have trouble with them.

“I have never been in a show
with costumes this gigantic,”
McKnight said. “‘Shrek’- back-
stage is a show’ in and of itself.
The traffic backstage is massive.

McKnight, like Mingo, stresses
one point — “Shrek” isn’t just

“It’s impossible to leave the
show unhappy. It’s full of en-
ergy,” he said. %

Seniors ready for tournament

Seniors 4 8

with three more wins and a trip to the
Elite Eight. 1

Brown, who is in his fifth season
at Pitt after redshirting his freshman
year, came in a year before Wanamaker
and McGhee. Since then, the three have
accomplished things that few other
senior classes can boast about.

In 2009 they climbed to the No. 1
ranking in the country for the first time
in school history while also earning the
school’s first ever win o_ver another No.
1 ranked team — Connecticut —' on
Feb. 16 of that year. '

“I said how good that class was go—
ing to be when we recruited them, but
they weren’t ranked high so nobody
believed me,” Pitt head coach Jamie
Dixon said. “I think they’ve proven it
in so many different ways.”-

Former classmate and current mem-
ber of the San Antonio Spurs Dejuan
Blair played a large role in helping

achieve those feats, as he too was

a member of this class. If he hadn’t

"declared for the NBA draft after his

sophomore year, he would be in his
senior year right now.

The void‘ left by Blair’s departure
and his 15.7 points and 12.8 rebounds
per game in 2009 would devastate
some programs and noticeably affect
the strength ofthe class. But this class
hasn’t slowed down without their for-
mer teammate. ‘ ,

_“Itjust shows how hard me, Gil and
Brad have been working and the rest of

the guys to keep fighting and keep get-

ting better even when people doubted
us,” McGhee said. V

McGhee was forced to step in as the
starting center when Blairleft. He went
from averagingjust more than six min-
utes a game his sophomore year to over
24 minutes the next season.

It was a tough adjustment for
McGhee, but he has handled it -well
and developed into one of the premier
defensive big men in the country —— and

Rivers brings
enthusiasm  

Seniors 4 14

a b_ig factor in Pitt’s Big East regular
seasonchampionship this season.
“Gary has become a great player,
a great center in the Big East as well
as the country, and it just shows how
much work we put in and how We were
dedicated to overcome our adversity as
players and students,” Brown said.

This season Brown and Wanamaker '

achieved personal milestones, both
joining the 1,000 point club at Pitt. For
Wanamaker, it signifies his hard work

._[as a, Panther the past four seasons.
¢j_“It’_s a great accomplishment, but

_it’d be even sweeter if we advance to

 the Final Fou‘ra_nd National Champion-
ship,” Wanamaker said.

i’ This senior class was joinedlby a
new member two seasons ago, when
former-student manager Nick Rivers
walked on to the team to start his ju-
nior season.

cWhile Rivers hasn’t gotten the op- P

portunity to. contribute as much on the

‘court as the other three have, he’s had

a profound effect on the team.
“Nick brings everything to the team.
' He brings laughter, he brings serious-
ness,.experience, he brings hard work
and leadershipfof his own,” Wanamaker
said. “He brings energy each and every
day. We might be down in practice, and
Nick will get us going.” «

All four are on pace to graduate this
year, McGhee and Wanamaker with de-
grees in communication, Brown with
a degree in sociology and Rivers with
a degree in economics.

It’s these things,ethe times in the
classroom and around campus, and not

just the time on the court that has made —

their Pitt experiences so memorable.

“Practice moments with coach,
things that happened in the dorm our
freshman year, just the small things
that forever are going to last in our
memories,” Brown said. “Those are the
things that we cherish and the things
about college that most people’ will
never forget.”

Though all those memories are
great, winning a National Champi-
onship this season would surely be a
standout Pitt memory, and a fitting

‘ end to a Pitt career that started with
postseason success. V

“You’re glad to achieve what you
could have in your four —— five years
here for me — and you’re proud ofwhat
this team has become this year,” Brown
said. “We just want to keep on pushing

it and possibly do something great.” I

Brea   ingdown Pitt’ s lac-ex

Greg T "r-ietley analyzes the teams in the’s'Sonthleds‘t'regilon‘  

Greg Trietley
Senior Staﬁ” Writer

 

The Pitt men’s basketball team got what it
wanted Sunday evening when the NCAA
Tournament Selection Committee award-
ed the Panthers a No. 1 seed. With Duke’s
ﬁnal—day win over North Carolina in the
ACC Championship, some feared that the
Blue Devils and surging N otre Dame would
bounce Pitt to a No. 2 seed.

Those fears were never realized.

“A couple of us talked about [a No. 2
seed] a little bit,” Pitt guard Ashton Gibbs
said. “But it really didn’t matter.”

1 All the speculation over who’s in and
who’s out, where teams will play and what
seed they will be awarded is over. What now
lies ahead for Pitt is a challenging South-
east Region filled with giant—killers, size
inside and the best player in the country.

Pitt won’t know its first opponent until
UNC—Asheville and Arkansas-Little Rock
play Tuesday night in the new First Four
round. But assuming the Panthers take
care of business against the No. 16 seed
— none has ever beaten a No. 1 -— they’ll
have a tricky trap game Saturday against
the winner of Butler and Old Dominion.

“Our reaction was ‘ooh’ when we saw
it was Butler and Old Dominion,” Brad
Wanamaker said after the bracket was
released.

No. 8 seed Butler fell a basket short of
the National Championship last year and
returns both Matt Howard (16.7 points per
game) and Shelvin Mack (15.2 points per
game). The Bulldogs have won nine con-
secutive games and have quietly returned
to form after a shaky start to the year.
They’re big and they’re experienced.

Old Dominion spent part of this year as
the nation’s best team on the boards. The
Monarchs are seventh in the country with
40.2 rebounds per game -— better than
Pitt, who is eighth. Connecticut sent the
Panthers packing in the Big East tourna-
ment by out—rebounding them. Old Domin-
ion will have the same gameplan.

Worried? Gary McGhee said he looks
forward to the challenge.

“I think it’s a very good, tough bracket,”
McGhee said Sunday. “There’s a lot of good
teams, but it’s what you look for in March
— playing against all the best teams.”

If Pitt survives the first weekend, the
rest of the bracket spotlights some of the
nation’s top backcourts. Michigan State
— a bubble team that held its breath for
its No. 10 seed — lives and dies with the
play of guards Kalin Lucas and Durrell
Summers. '

The Spartans underachieved this year,
but Tom Izzo’s squad always seems to turn
it on in March. A No. 5 seed last season,
they still advanced to the Final Four.

And the most well-known of all the na-
tion’s guards," Brigham Young’s Jimmer
Fredette, lurks in the region as a No. 3
seed. Fredette ‘Mania has been one of col-
lege basketball’s top stories — he has 19
straight games with at least 20 points.

The Cougars have played only one
ranked team —- San Diego State, thrice
—— but should they and Pitt meet up in the
Elite Eight, it could be the biggest test in
the history of Jamie Dixon’s much—hyped
defense, no hyperbole needed.

The suspension of Cougar forward Bran-
don Davies — who violated the school’s
honor code by having premarital sex —
might tip the scales in the Panthers’ favor.
Brigham Young has struggled to rebound
without him and has gone just 3-2.

No. 5 seed Kansas State is guard—heavy
as well. Although Pitt big man McGhee
could present a problem for a high—scoring
ﬁnesse team like the Wildcats, Kansas State
is one of three teams in the region that
upset a No. 1—ranked team this year.

In addition to Kansas State’s win over
Kansas, No. 4 seed Wisconsin upset Ohio
State and No. 6 seed St. John’s throttled
Duke at Madison Square Garden.

, Wisconsin, like so many teams in this
region, has the capacity to make a run.
The Badgers showed in their win over the
Buckeyes that their versatile big men can
out-rebound the best on one end of the
court and knock down perimeter shots on
the other, inconsistent as they might be.

One thing that Pitt’s region isn’t chock
full of, surprisingly, is Big East teams. Only
one other conference opponent resides in
the Southeast: St. John’s.

Revenge will be on the Panthers’ mind
if the two teams meet in the Elite Eight, as
the Red Storm upset Pitt 60-59 in February
on a controversial last—second lay—up. But
both teams have a lot of work to do if they
want to get that far. ”

Another familiar face in the region is
Wofford, the No. 14 seed. Pitt opened last
season with a 63-60 win over the Ter-
riers. What looked like a shaky start to
the year, though, turned out to be a vic-
tory over a quality opponent, as Wofford
won its conference and held Wisconsin
to 53 points in the tournament. The team
will look to do similar things this year to
Brigham Young.

Even No. 12—seed Utah State has a de-
fense that can keep games close in March.
The Aggies held Louisiana Tech to 30
points last week. __ 3

The Florida Gators, a bit of a surprise
as a No. 2 seed, rest at the bottom of the
region. But before Pitt can worry about
Florida, Brigham Young, St. John’s, Wof-
ford or anyone not named UNC—Asheville
or Arkansas-Little Rock, it has to start its
journey to the Final Four with a win Thurs-
day. After that, anything can happen. I

Pitt to travelto D.C.  

Bracket 4 10

But the Panthers’ eyes are solely focused
on the ﬁrst—round games being hosted in the
Verizon Center in Washington, D.C.

“I was excited about playing in D.C.,” Pitt
head coachjamie Dixon said. “I thought we’d
end up in Cleveland because of proximity.”

Pitt disposed of Georgetown in January
at the Verizon Center, but this time around
there should be plenty more Pitt fans in
attendance. 5

“D.C. is close (by. A lot of teammates’
families will be there,” Brown said. There is
deﬁnitely an advantage from playing in a fa-
miliar arena. You’re used to the atmosphere,
the court, the background and everything.
It should be easy for us to adjust to.”

I 4- . The Panthers will face the winner of the

9 match-up between UNC-Asheville and Ar-‘

1 kansas—Little Rock, who will play on Tuesday
night_ in a tournament play-in game. .
Also in the Panthers’ Southeast bracket
is‘ last year’s national runner—up, Butler, who
I will face Old Dominion, a talented rebound-
ing team that emulates Pitt’s style of play.

_ Fifth seeded Kansas State and No. 4 seed
Wisconsin also have hopes of heading to New
Orleans, and both teams could be very dan-
gerous in a match—up with the Panthers.

1 In the bottomhalf of the Panthers’ brack-
et, St. John’s is the No. 6 seed. The Red Storm

knockedoff Pitt in Madison Square Garden
on Feb. 19.

“They are playing well,” Dixon said of the
Red Storm after Pitt’s loss. “They have eight
seniors and it is a unique situation; They all
played together and got close and gained a
lot of experience.”

BYU is the third seeded Southeast team
and is led by All-Americanjimmer Fredette,
who comes into the tournament averaging
28.5 points per game.

Perennial powers UCLA and Michigan
State will tip off in a match—up of No. 7 and
No. 10 seeds. UCLA is coached by Dixon’s

Dixon continues to climb
NCAA coaching ranks

Isaac Saul
Staff Writer

Everyone has tovstart somewhere.

For Pitt men’s basketball head coach Jamie
Dixon, that somewhere was the basketball courts
of New York.

Years after spending summer vacations play-
ing ball in his parents’ home state, Dixon now has
the mostwins of any NCAA Division I coach in his
ﬁrst eight seasons as a head coach. He now leads
the Panthers into the NCAA Tournament as a No.
1 seed. I

There is no argument that his 215 wins in eight
seasons will give Dixon a case for being one of the
best of all time, but he isn’t quick to praise him-
self.

“I don’t feel that at all,” Dixon said. “You just
keep it inperspective. Players winthe game —— that
will never change.” _

Dixon grew up in Los Angeles, where baseball
was the dominant sport. Yet when it came to bas-
ketball, which he had grown to love during his sum-
mers in NewYork, he always knew he felt something
stronger about the sport.

“I always enjoyed playing, but I thinkl may have
been a little bit different from all the other guys

all aspects of the game, whatever it was, organizing

leagues and teams or coaching in kids’ leagues.” _

After a successful college basketball career at
Texas Christian University, Dixon began his coach-
ing career in a New Zealand high school league
and then spent some time at UC Santa Barbara,
Hawaii and Northern Arizona before landing a
spot at Pitt as an associate coach and recruiting
coordinator in 1999.

His move from assistant to head coach was not
a decision that came without some close calcula-
tion on Dixon’s part as-he was set to take over for
longtime mentor and friend Ben Howland.

“I was at the crossroads in ﬁguring out what I
had to do and what I wanted to do,” Dixon said. “I
really felt I wanted to be a head coach but I wasn’t
in a rush todo it by a certain time. Iwanted it to be
at the right time in the right place with the right
people around me.”

Dixon’s 215-59 career record should be enough
to declare his decision a success,, but Dixon’s deﬁni-
tion of success isn’t like mostpeople’s.

“Ifyou continue to improve any day, that’s where

to‘close out the first half, ‘heading
into halftime down by just one point
at 41-40. _
Calhoun cited the difference in his
team as the toughness that enabled the
Huskies to get back into the game.

“In or about that point leading to
the first half, I thought we toughened
up,” Calhoun said. .

“It was one of those games where
Pittsburgh says ‘We’re tough, tell me
how toughyou are, and ifyou’re tough
enough you can beat us,”’ Calhoun
said. “Today we answered that chal-
lenge.” - .

The loss hurts the Panthers even
more because Connecticut beat them
at their own style of play — playing
tougher, getting to loose balls and
grabbing rebounds — all mantras of
Pitt’s program over the past decade.

“We got beat at our own game, espe-
cially on the boards,” Pitt head coach
Jamie Dixon said. . _ .

. The Huskies outrebounded Pitt 32-
25 and forced 11 turnovers.

Yet the Panthers remained in the A

lead for most of the game, in large
part because of Gibbs’ shooting — he
finished the game with 27 points and
six 3—pointers. Pitt’s Brad Wanamaker
finished the game with 17 points.

But the Huskies managed to tie the
score and run down the clock on their
last possession to let Walker take the
game’s final shot". p

“I think he’s the most important
guy for a single te-am in college bas-
ketball,” Calhoun said. .

Walker finished the game with 24
points and teammate Alex Oriakhi
finished with 13 points and tied for a
game—high seven rebounds.

“Alex came alive,” Calhoun said.

Gibbs and the rest of his teammates
hope to use this loss as a motivational
tool in the NCAA Tournament, which
begins this week.

“We talked about winning all three
crowns,” Gibbs said. “That’s what we
talked about all year — regular‘sea-
son, Big East and NCAA. _We didn’t get

this one, but it’s extra motivation for

an NCAA Tournament.” I

Oakland Zoo highlights traditions

Roger Sepich
Staff Writer

Professional baseball might be America’s
pastime and professional football may cur-
rently be this country’s most popular and
proﬁtable sport, but there’s something unique

About collegiate athletics that instills a pride
in fans and alumni that isn’t typically found
at professional levels. ’

Though many fans will say they just like
watching athletes play for the love of the
game, it’s each school’s traditions that cre-
ate spectacular atmospheres at events and
give supporters of each college something
to call their own.

From Kansas’ famous “Rock Chalk, Jay-
haw ” chant to the Ohio State band’s script
Ohio, schools across the nation take pride in
their unique traditions. ' '

 And over the past few years, the improv-
ing fortune of the Pitt men’s basketball team
on the court has gone hand in hand with the
development of several traditions within and
around the program.

Most recognizable of them all is the Oak-
land Zoo.

The intimidating and raucous student
section gets behind the Panthers at every
home basketball game and is one of the main
reasons that the Petersen Events Center is
considered one of the toughest places to play

in all of college basketball.

But most people don’t realize the Zoo took
a while to become as popular as it is today.

“The Zoo was started up back in 2001 by
a student named Matt Cohen and a couple of
his friends,” former Pitt player and current as-
sistant coach Brandin Knight said. “It wasn’t
well received at ﬁrst and the school didn’t
want to sponsor them, but it took off after a
while and now it’s iconic for the University.
Kids come with the T-shirts and it’s brought
a different dynamic and attitude to playing
at home.”

Once the students started making their
presence known, it didn’t take the players
long to come up with a noticeable tradition
of their own. c

When forward ].J. Richardson and guard
Nick Rivers began dancing exuberantly in the
middle of the pre—game team huddle a few
seasons ago, it didn’t take long for the fans
to take notice and the concept has become a
ritual for the Panthers.

. “The dance is the dougie,” Richardson
said. “I really like dancing, so I just go out
there and do my thing.”

“I tell them all the time the cute things
they do are different from the nitty-gritty
style from when I played,’,’ Knight said. “But
they’ve kept up the winning tradition and
have done it their own way.”

Pitt  
handshakes
unique

before every game when the starters
are announced. Gibbs’ introduction,
which includes a pat down, has fol-
lowed him since high school.

“My father told me to do it one
time because I was a shooter,” he said.
“It’s not literally having a gun, but
checking to see ifl h-ave a gun because
I’m hot a lot.’ That’s really what it
came down to.”

Former Pitt forward _Tyrell Biggs
created a number of the team’s hand-
shakes, including starter Nasir Rob-
inson’s introduction that ends with
a swipe across his chest. 7

‘.‘We both have tattoos across our

chests,” Robinson said. “Everyone
with tattoos on their chests does that
handshake. There’-s four or five of
us.” 1 .
‘Robinson said Biggs had a hand-
shake with everyone on the team and
that he’s been doing his own ,hand~
shake since Biggs’ time at Pitt.

“I don’t know where it came from,”
he said. “I guess hejust thought about
it at home and I’ve been doing it ever
since.”

Both Gilbert Brown and Gary
McGhee said the team members came
up with a lot of the handshakes on the
spur of the moment.

“It’s something the team has always
done with each other,” McGhee said.
“Everybody has their own handshake
that we just came up with off the top
of our heads.”

When he’s, introduced, McGhee
walks through the line of his team-
mates and knocks elbows with them.
Brown said he also doesn’t remem-
ber where many of the handshakes
originated.

a~“We made it up right there on the
spot before the game or something,”
he said. ”Everybody does have one
with everyone on the team. It’s just
something we do, it’s like a little bond
between each other.”

Senior Brad Wanamaker, the last
player introduced at home games,

doesn’t have a handshake for an in- -

troduction. Instead, he jumps up with
the player who meets him at the end
of the line.

“I don’t know where it came from,”
he said. “Sometimes wejust sit around
and do handshakes. It’s something
exciting, something new.” I

Panthers take part in team rituals

Traditions 4 22

Although the players have shown they
know how to have fun, they are just as ad-
equate when it comes to showing respect.

It isn’t as ﬂashy as the dancing, but it has
become a tradition before every game for
each Pitt starter to shake hands with every
person at the press table, including long-

I time radio commentators Dick Groat and

Bill Hillgrove.

Additionally, during the game, when a
Pitt player gets subbed out, he will always
acknowledge every person on the bench -
even the managers and trainers —- with either

a handshake or a ﬁst pound.

“It’s all about the team attitude,” Knight
said of the ritual.

He also admits that even the coaches get
caught up with things like traditions and
routines.

“We have a time regimen every game and
go to the same hotels when we travel,” he
said. “I think lack of change just helps keep
consistency within the program.”

It doesn’t take a guy like Knight, who has
been around the team for a lengthy amount of
time, to see the importance of Pitt’s growing

“When I saw the Zoo and everything else
that was going on here, I knew this was the
place for me,” redshirt freshman Lamar Pat-
terson said.

But according to Knight, there is still one
thing that the Panthers need to add to their
tradition for it to be complete. ‘"

“Winning a National Championship would
be big,” Knight said. “I told these guys if you
want to be remembered, you’ve got to do
something great and win that title. No one
remembers who ﬁnishes second.” I

you’ll reach any goal you could think of,” Dixon
said. “We don’t put it into games, wins and losses
or selling tickets. It’s about these guys getting '
better individually and as a team.”

V Because‘ of his style of coaching that relies
on discipline, defense and rebounding, Dixon
recruits players with a strong work ethic. His
model for recruitment is one that has been
imitated by many assistant coaches who have
worked with Dixon.

One characteristic ofDixon’s style of recruit-
ing is having conﬁdence in the recruit.

“If you believe a kid is good enough, is a
quality kid who will get better and wants to get
better and has the hunger, then you take that
kid,” Dixon said. “You don’t question yourself 1
because somebody ranked him lowerwho hasn’t
even seenhimplay. .

“I think you also have to envision where
they’re going to be,” Dixon said. “Where a kid
is at 16 is not where he is going to be at 20 or
21 and I think that is something that is very im- ‘
portant to us.”

recruits ———IWasir Robinson — ranked in Rivals
top 150 players. Other previously under-the-
radar players in that class, like Ashton Gibbs
and Travon Woodall, have ﬂourished since ar-
riving at Pitt. I
Now, with the program thriving and having
earned plenty of success throughout the past
decade, the team has become involved in more
than just the sport. ’ I
‘ ‘For Coach Dixon, his players and staff are a
representation of the city of Pittsburgh and the
University they attend. The added exposure that
came with Pitt’s success has also taught Dixon
about howto handle losing staff and players who

vice from another Pittsburgh coaching legend.

* “We had a couple assistants looking to be
head coaches, an_dI remember talkingto coach
[Bill] Cowherwhen hewas here about it,” Dixon
said. “He said, ‘with your success, you’ve got to
be readyfor coaches to move and be moving on.’
He said thatwas something he really had to deal
with on the Steelers.”

Even with assistants and players coming and
going, two things remain constant in Dixon’s
system — hard work and accountability.

“Aw“tnan,” senior guard Brad Wanamaker
said with a laugh. “That ﬁrst year was tough,
man. Coachwas always on my head about things
that I wasn’t doing right. But looking back on it,
he was just worrying about me getting the best
out of it and improving to 'be the best player
that I could be.” v ‘

Now Wanamaker gets to watch Dixon break
in players from the sidelines.

“It’s actually ﬁmny because Gilbert [Brown],
Gary [McGhee] and I, we constantly laugh about
it,” Wanamaker said. “We tell them, ‘We were '
in your shoes at one point too in our careers. ‘I

Te'a,m.fails to make .pos_ts,ecison: A look baciklat this. seasonand a look ahead tonext season

" Torie Wytiaz '

“Staff Writer

Just one looklat the 2010-11 Pitt women’s
basketball roster and schedule made it clear
thatthis would bea challengi_ng year. c
_ This year’s team was uniquely composed
of only seniors andnfreshmen, and as the
Panthers competed in the Big East, they
knew each conference game would present

‘ a competitive challenge. *

’ These factors’ might have contributed to
the 14-17 record for the Panthers, their ﬁrst
losing record since the 2004-05 season.

This season also marks the ﬁrst time the
Panthers failed, to‘ enter postseason play
afterﬁve consecutive appearances.

As ‘the! Panthers prepared to enter the 

Big- East Tournament as a No. 12 seed with a
13-16 record, the possibility of not making
postseason play loomed large. .

Prior to 1 the team’s ﬁrst game against
No. 13 South Florida, Pitt head coach Agnus

‘Berenato acknowledged the difficult task 1 

that her team faced.
“It’s pretty simple-for us: Weneed to
0 win and if we don’t, we go home,” Berenato:

said. I . 

The Panthers responded against the“

Bulldogs and pulled out a 63-60 victory,» b’i.1t" .3.

came up short in their next contest against
No. 5-seeded Marquette, falling 65-61. .

Despite a losing record and an absence
from national tournament competition,
the 2010-11 season was not without its
highlights, both team-oriented and indi-
vidual. 0

The most impressive victory for the
Panthers came against then—No. 14 West
Virginia in a 60-53 win on the Mountain-
eers’ home court in Morgantown.

The Panthers were led by Taneisha
Harrison and her 30 points in that game.
Throughout the season, Harrison, a se-
nior, was often the team’s primary offensive
threat. '

Harrison was named to the Big East
Honor Roll twice and,.upon the conclu-
sion of the regular season, was also voted
to the All-Big East second team.

Harrison said her time at Pitt has been

' a rewarding athletic experience.

“I just love basketball, and that’s why
I chose to come to Pitt,” Harrison said. “I
knew I would have a chance to learn, do
what I love and do it at a high level.”

Harrison ﬁnished the season as the Pan-
thers’ leading scorer, averaging 15.2 points
per game and turning in 25 double-digit
scoring performances on the year.

Playing at an equally high level was
fellow senior Chelsea Cole. Cole was also
named to the All-Big East team as an hon-
orable mention selection, thanks in part to
her rebounding dominance.

Cole came into that role early last sea-
son, as soon as she realized it‘ was a hole

that needed to be filled. f

_“In preseason workouts, the coaches
would emphasize the’ need to improve in
rebounding,” Cole said. ?‘.I knew that was

my department and that I needed to step A

up my game in that area.” _ _
Averaging over 10 rebounds per game

and contributing to the offense, Cole record-

ed a Big East—leading 16 double—doubles.
The other two members of the/senior

class, Shayla Scott and Jania Sims, also’
. earned individual honors throughout the

season. 7 _
Scott received the Pat Blayden Spirit of

Sport Award, given in February to a Pitts- A

burgh-area female collegiate athlete who
shows commitment to academic and athletic
excellence while maintaining community
involvement. , ,

Scott, who served as a two-year captain

for the Panthers and averaged just fewer

than 10 points per game, was honored
by her selection and considered it a team
honon

  

 secondroundofBig East Way   

‘ . 9,.
“I am excited to have received this honor
and to be able to represent-the University
of Pittsburgh and the women’s basketball
team,” Scott said. ’
“Every individual award is a team one.”
S Sims’ entry into the Pitt women’s bas-
ketball 1,000 point club came in a Feb."‘1‘-'
victory over Cincinnati in which she posted
24 points. b
For Sims, the achievement was a reward

Seniors paced teamthis year

Women’s basketball 4 35

for hard work through two injuries and ﬁve
years at the, University.

“Finally,” Sims said after the Cincinnati
game.. “I told myself I would never get to
1,000 points, but I’ve been through a lot
and it feels like a great reward.”

Berenato agreed, noting that “it’s been
a long, hard road” for Sims throughout her
Pitt career, as she was ineligible for her ﬁrst
year and sidelined by an injury as a redshirt
sophomore. .

The senior members of the squad faced

‘a tough road as a whole this season, as they

were the lone experienced players surround-
ed by new recruits.

But Berenatohas seen .growth and im-
provement among the freshmen players
that could lead to future success,

V “This is not a typical freshmen class,”
Berenato said. “They knew they we would
beasking a lot from them early on.”

Freshman Ashlee Anderson, aware of
the class disparity on the team, recognized
the importance of this year as a chance to
learn. . '

“We need to develop the type of presence
we want to have in the future,” Anderson
said. “We have four seniors on this team,
and when they are gone, we need to pick
things up and continue to move the program

forward.”

Anderson is joined, by six fellow soon-
to -be sophomores who willilook to lead an
incoming class of recruits ranked No. 19 by
ESPN HoopGurlz.

Loliya Briggs, a guard from Florida —
rated No. 50 overall by the same service
—— will add versatility in her passing and
scoring ability. _ .

joining Briggs at the guard position will
be Brianna Kiesel, a shooting threat with a
great amount of speed.

Chyna Golden, Cora McManus and Ti-
Anna Porter are the recruits at the forward
position and each contributed heavily to

, their high school team’s scoring and re-
bounding. ’ -

y “This is an exciting time to be‘ a Pitt
Panther,” Berenato said in regards tothe
upcoming season and the additions from

"the incoming players. “Each member of
_ this class represents the future of Pitt bas-

ketball.” ‘

Though the recent season might not have
produced the post-season excitement the
Panthers have come to expect, the achieve-
ments of the four seniors deserve to be
acknowledged as the stage seems set for
resurgence in 2011-12. a
