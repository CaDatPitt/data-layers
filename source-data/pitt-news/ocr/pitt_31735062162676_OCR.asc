Broadway Hit

At Playhouse,
Quiz Scandal

“Make A Million,” a suc-
cessful B ro ad W a y comedy
about ‘the current TV quiz
scandal, opened Saturday at

‘ th e Pittsburgh Playhouse.

Written by Norman Barasch
and Carroll Moore, “Make A Mil-
lion” involves a harassed TV pro-
ducer, played by Playhouse vet-
eran Bobby Nellis, and a shapely
southern lass, played by Play-
house newcomer Verna Bloom, a
contestant who has the TV public
around her little ﬁnger. Nellis’
problem is to keep his pretty con-
testant from running off to be
married before she has reached

the ‘ highest plateau.

Connie Barker, Allan Pinsker,

. Drew Kloman, Gene Hresha, and

a host of others complete the cast
of comic characters.

Producer Frederick Burleigh
has brought Charles Goff from
New York to direct this hilarious
comedy. The setting, which is the
TV producer’s swank New York
office, is by Thomas Struthers.

’While “Make a Million” runs

in the Hamlet Street Theater,
three other shows are now in
progress. The comedy “Who
Was That Lady I Saw You
With,” about a professor who is
caught kissing a co-ed, ends this
weeks. The Theater Upstairs
opened its second season last
week with "Epitaph for George
Dillon,” written by John Os-
borne, author of “Look Back in
Anger” and “The Entertainer.”

Every Saturday at 2:30 p.m. the
Playhouse Jr. holds forth for the
junior theater-goer. This month’s
fare is “Rumpe1sti1tskin,” the
children’s favorite about the
dwarf who spins gold from straw.

Ticket information for all pro-
duction may be obtained by call-'
ing Ma. 1-4445. Ticket prices for
major shows are $1.95 Monday
through Friday and $2.95 on Sat-

 Abolish Political Parties

A motion presented in Student Government Assn, Mora;
day provides for SGA-subsidization of political parties.
approved, this motion naturally would strengthen these
parties. Rather than being strengthened, however, political
parties should be abolished. _

This is not an anti-democratic idea, as might be charged,
but it is a realistic idea that has evolved as a result of the
officially recognized
on campus. _ ,

When parties were okayed for_the ﬁrst time in 1955,
three objectives were stated. Parties, the elections com-

I mittee said, would give studentsopportunity for experience

in organization of politicalparties similar to those in local
and national government, would stimulate student interest
in student government organizations and would establish

acceptable standards of operation for student politicalaor-I

ganizations. ‘ _ _ _ _.
Taking these objectives individually, some students

have had the chance to work on the organization of parties,
but that number never has been great. Small groups always
have set themselves up as the “organizers,” excluding those
who they felt were unworthy of organizing their parties. I
Secondly, interest in student government organiza-
tions is no greater now that it was pre-parties. Each year

vacancies exist in races for several ofﬁces. Only once in the,

past ﬁve years was the student body interested in voting and
that was in 1958 when more than 2,000 voted. But last
year’s 1,387 v‘oters showed that interest once again had
dropped back down to its usual low.

As for the third objective, it is the one which has been
most ﬂagrantly violated. It is difficult for us to see how
anyone could say that parties have been operating under
acceptable standards. At least the standards are not what

' we call acceptable.

vMore than anything, perhaps, parties have fostered ir-
responsibility. This ‘was seen last year when one of the
parties falsely signed names to its petition in order to have
the required number of names. It was seen when the same
party forged the signature of one of its candidates on a list
saying that person wanted to be slated by the party. Again
this year, candidates’ names were added illegally to the
printed slates of a party. '

' This irresponsibility also can be seen in the way of
parties submit ﬁnancial statements as is required. At least
one party every year fails to turn in this statement, ‘a rela-
tively simple task.

Before parties were officially recognized, there were vio-
lations of good democratic practices in‘ the elections. Organ-
ized parties, it was argued, would halt this. After ﬁve
years, though, the practices have not improved. This has
been a long enough “trial” period.

Student government will not suffer from ‘a no-party
system. Individuals running for an office alone, or with
one or two other candidates, can create a better student gov-
ernment than that molded by irresponsible parties.

Sane Man's Troubles

By David Breakstone
There are evenings when Edward- P. Morgan
sounds like the sanest man in the country.

opinion worthy of discussion. But in another kind
of times, it may bear further i
inspection. _Morgan broadcasts a ;
15-minute news program nightly
at 7 o’clock, sponsored by the
AFL-CIO. . .

Rather ‘than taking a com-
pletely pro-union, anti—admini-
stration stand, however, Morgan
usually delivers his news straight
and reserves his own opinions
for the ﬁnal ﬁve minutes or so.
Editorial comment on radio and, a
television is hard to ﬁnd in these ~ g 1
days of bland acceptance of everything that comes
down the golden highway-. No one likes to takea
stand if he thinks that someone is likely to take
issue with him, particularly if that, someone is
located in a higher echelon.

I But it is not only a fear of censure by power-
ful, influential superiors that keeps~most_men, not
just radio and TV men, quiet. But it is also a re-
luctance, even fear, to get into a debate where a
man’s own opinions may be subjected to severe
examination. The worth of the individual’s opin-
ion has been largely minimized, even discounted in
a‘ streamlined society engineered by huge mono-
lithic institutions which produce“‘ideas and anal-
ysis” in bright colored cardborad ‘display cases

ing the “all-American corporate seal of approval.”
Who can buck such merchandising? Not even a

Two Notable Broadcasts
,But on occasion Morgan" gives evidence that he

 

can still use his voice and head in hopes that

somewhere in rural America someone has his radio
turned on in the twilight hours. When,I mentioned
the man’s sanity, I was referring particularly to
two broadcasts that he did a'couple of weeks ago,
at a time when our prev-packaged national image
was obscured by a little more mud.

On that Tuesday night he circumspectly ap-
proached the television quiz scandal. He viewed
with some sadness the plight of Mr. Van Doren,

a young man who had apparently seen the gleam of

gold that only appears once in a lifetime. .Mr.
Morgan then went on to speculate about the impli-
catioins of the quiz scandal upon the television
business as a whole. He said that the natural tend-
ency would be_to surmise that the public would
take offense at the wool which hadlibeen so
cunningly pulled over their naive eyes.

However, this was not the case. According to a
survey conducted by the trade journal, “Broad-
casting,” 84 per cent of the viewers polled «said

In
ordinary times this would probably not be an.

    
  
 
   

that the scandal would have no effect upon their
attitude toward television generally, nor would it
change their viewing habits. Morgan noted that
this lack of concern over the whole mess reﬂected
the nation’s general indifference to anything that
occurs in this country or abroad, and also a tend-
ency to relax the public sense of morality which
was once a signiﬁcant aspect of a Puritan-minded
society. V
The President's View

The following _evening Morgan centered his
comment around the President’s, press conference
of the same day. He commented brieﬂy on the
President’s remarks about the steel‘ strike and a
forthcoming summit co’nference.'He then reported
the President’s reply ’to a question about whether
or not he felt that the television fraud reﬂected a
general moral laxity on the part of the entire
nation. The President replied that he was
“shocked”, at the disclosures about the quiz shows,
but that he joined the American people in hoping
that the "industry would clean up its own house.

Morever, he did ‘not feel that the lack of strong
reaction was indicative of a decadent ethical

standard. Mr. Morgan agreed with the ‘President’s,;fi? ,

opinion to the extent that this one incident was
not in itself a_ sign of debased values, but that the
lack of concern by anyone could have serious
meaning in the future, the near future. Mr. Morgan
added that a report out of Moscow stated that the

/2

Russians might continue the policy of allowing.

.“Voice of America” and other western’ broadcasts

ﬁlterinto their country unhampered. by the tra- -

ditional “jamming.”
Good News? ,

Morgan observed that the Russians probably
felt that it was becoming quite safe to allow news
fromthe U; S. to reach the ears of the hard-work-

of the past few months concerned the longest,

costliest steel strike in the nation’s history, the,

continuation of racial tension and the non-integra-

tion tactics .of both North and South, the mush-A

rooming crime rate in the East, the “triumphal”

visit of Mr. K., and lately, the quiz ﬁx. Why not

let the people learn about the wonderful things
that are happening in the west? Morgan concluded

byreporting the announcement that the Red Radio‘

was beginning a new, rig-proof quiz show for

the people. ,

There are occasions when the voice of even a
veteran witness of the eccentricities of an irra-
tional world betrays a hint of world-weariness.

Those two broadcasts of Edward Morgan gave

the lonelylistener the uncomfortable feeling that
a knowing man was troubled, and for a good

reason. One is tempted to wonder how many others-

were troubled by him. Madison Avenue would

say not many; those that were undoubtedly were I

egg—heads. And they
“moneywise.”

Letters To

Pep Rally-ers Have
Poor‘ Sense of Values

0 Editor, the Pitt News: _
’ This letter is in reference to.

an incident which occurred last
Monday during the “spontane-
ous” pep rally. All during the
10 a.m. hour the demonstrators
raved, --and at the 11 a.m. hour

word was passed that there were

to be no classes. .
At that hour Dr. Kanwisher
has a philosophy class which de-
cided, of its own free will, that
it would rather pursue the I. re-
flective life for an‘ hour than
waste time and energy shouting,
screaming, and parading. .\

No sooner had we begun than A

an army '01 most unreﬂective
pupils — I cannot justly call
them students —— molested our
classroom and set up an infernal

_‘ din of, “No, more classes.” No

one in the class gave any indica-
tion of wanting to leave.

This apparently enraged the
group, for they shouted louder.
They simply could not under-
stand that we in the class might
possibly want seriously to learn
something. They left, but they

« returned twice more in the hour

exhibiting similar behavior and
turning off the lights in the
classroom.’

.Dr. Kanwisher said that he
had no objection to our leaving
class. They yelled that fact at
us and then changed. their chant

  

to, “i'i'o school spirit.” We ﬁnally
managed t9 conclude our class,
but not without the loss of ten to
15 ear—spli'tting minutes which
were most upsetting.

I feel that an observation or
two is -in order. In-the ﬁrstplace,
quite apart from other consid-
erations, at the university level,
one is supposed to know that
others have a _right to act as

. they see fit, as long as that ac-

tion does not interfere unjustly
with thejsimilar freedoms of
someone else. -

In the light of this well-known
tenet of our form of government,
it is quite easy to determine who
the transgressors, were in this
case. But to progress further, I
cannot help but be greatly sad-
dened by the superior position
these people ascribed to a mere
pep rally, apparently placing a
mob-scene higher in value than
the acquisition of knowledge.

If they don’t want any more
classes, the solution seems sim-
ple: drop out of the university.
One ﬁnal note: None of us are
against school spirit, but we are
against allowing the lesser as-
pects of life usurp the place of
the greater. Everyone knows the
saying that there is a time for
everything.

In this case, I ask, why was
this exhibition of school spirit
deferred for two whole days?
Why were classes disrupted
when there was no emergency or
higher acad ’ '

There is no defense, that is," no

fense, for the aforementioned ac-
tions, except that some of the

would seem, in light of the cri-
teria that I have noticed are in

As for the Fine Arts Library,
it is used, at present, primarily
for students who want a quiet
place to study, not for people
interested in ﬁne arts. The Frick

as well be in Carnegie Library.

I have not read anywhere just
exactly where the money for

Engineer Seminars

Make Classes Close
Editor, the Pitt News: __
In your ; editorial of Nov. 9

(“ ‘First Class’ Cohesion”), you -

stated a need for some type of
gathering which would promote

éigreater closeness within the stu-

dents, particularly the seniors.
An‘ institution which would
meet this has been in effect in
the School of Engineering and
Mines for a long time. This is
the Engineering Seminars. These

' seminars not only serve con-

structive purposes, but also serve
as a means of getting all the
students together once a week
to elect officers and cabinet
members and to discuss their in-

54‘: terests.

Perhaps this is why the en-
gineers. are a closer group than
any other group of comparable
size in the university. I suggest
that interested students use our
seminars as an example to set up
similar meetings
university. If you can accom-
plish one-half the cohesion in
the university that now exists
among. the engineers due to
these seminars, then it is well
worth your while.

I am ﬁrmly and completely

enough enthusiasm.

«Panther Mudders Prepare foriState.

A Cox, Cunningham, Ditka

iToncic Lead Statistics

Oh where, oh where are those little rain clouds. That’s
the song John Michelosen and his Panther eleven will be
singing Saturday morning before the Penn State game.

After the last two showings against Boston College and
N otre Dame which were played in the mud the Panthers have
beenvoted the number one team in the nation in the mud.

the Cats are going to have their
hands full with the Lions. Coach
Rip Engle will bring to town a
team with an 8-1 record and the
ﬁnest quarterback in the country.
Lucas Leads Nation

Richie Lucas, who is without a
doubt the best all-around quarter-
back in the Nation, has led the
Lions into serious contention for a
bid to the leading bowls in the
nation. The foremost being the
Orange Bowl. ' »

If the Panthers are ever going
to be ready for the mighty Lions
now is the time. Riding a two
game win streak the Blue and
Gold have looked impressive in
their last two outings.

After Boston College there was
still some skepticism about the
. strength of the Panthers but the
sound whipping they handed
Notré Dame has convinced most
‘followers the Cats are ready for
State. .
Toncic Heads Passers

After their first nine games the
Blue and Gold have come up with
some startling statistics. It will
surprise no one that Fred Cox
and Jim Cunningham have risen
to the top in the ground gaining
department but the surprise is
that Cox is averaging better than
seven yards per carry.

Ivan Toncic is leading in the
passing department while Mike
Ditka has grabbed more passes
than anyone‘ else. Cox leads in
scoring and Cunningham is
number one man on the punt
and kickoff returns.

Boaters Try

F or 6th Win
At Penn State

By‘JACK SMITH

The Panther booters travel
to Penn State Saturday to
play t-he Lions in their last
contest of theseason. Coach
Leo Bemis’ boys have had a
fairly successful season thus
far compiling a 5-3-1 record.

The Lions, on the other hand,
have had only a fair season de-
spite their apparent wealth of ma-
terial. But the Lions have been
using many sophomores through-
out the season and this could be
a re-building year. However,
when State and the Cats meet in
any sport, the record books can
be thrown away. ’

Nittany Lions the Panthers have
come out on the short end of
every score. Last year the Cats
took a 5-2 setback. State, which
draws a wealth of material from
around Philadelphia, a’ soccer
playing area, has always met
the Blue and Gold with a strong
team. . ,

Leading the‘Lions will be cen-
ter-forward Garrett Miller. Miller
hit for three of the Lions ﬁve
goals last year and will be the
biggest center-forward the Pan-
thers have seen this year.

“I hope theboys want to win
this one,” stated Bemis. “This is
the best chance we have had in
years to upset them, ﬁnally. I’m
sure the boys will win if they
play like I know they can.”

Ed Giraldo, who broke his leg
last week in th Michigan State
game,’will definitely be ‘out for
the remainder of the season.
Ron‘ Wyatt is" still sufferfing
from a strained - groin muscle,
but Bemis will keep him out of
practice for the entire week in
hope that he will be ready Sat-
urday.- ' - .

Wyatt, who has been an out-
standing fullback for the Panthers
all season is one of the six grad-

eleven. .
Other graduating seniors, are
Ron Podmilsak', Pete Karavellas,

George’ Zanicopoulos.

Hometown Friends to Honor Lucas P

Who Holds N ittany Offense Record

The bowl~bound Nittany Lions of Penn State roll into
town Saturday to close out the regular grid season. With
them they will bring an impressive 8-1 record and the best

quarterback in the country.

It will be “Richie Lucas Day”. at the Stadium as his
friends from nearby Glassport willbe honoring their local

A
V

all—American. Rollout Richie, as$
he is called ‘by his admirers at

State, has broken the total offense
record at State, is a good passer,

leads the-team in punting and is
their best defensive back.’

In short he is an all-American

‘and could be the best all-around

. ,1‘

football player in the nation.
State’s talent, however, does not
stop with Lucas.
Kochman Like Cox
They have another back whose
varsity career is somewhat similar
to that of the Panther’s Fred Cox.
He is Roger Kockman. Like_Cox
he has sat on the bench most of
the season. When he ﬁnally did
get a chance to see action he
made the most of it.
V Afterreturning "a kickoff for
a TD and starring against West
Virginia the young sophomore
has been promoted to the ﬁrst
team. While Cox holds a tre-
mendous average of seven yards
per carry Kochman has netted
11 yards every time Lucas has
handed him the pigskin.
With Lucas and Kochman lead-

‘ ingthe way the Lions chalked up

seven straight victories before
loseing to Syracuse, the number
one team in the nation, by only
two points. , ‘
Has Better Record

Theirvictories came at the ex-.'

pense of Missouri (19-8), V.M.I.

. rushing honors._ Lucas has. picked

(21-0), Colgate‘ (53-20), Army
(17-11), Boston U. (21-12),._I1li-
nois (20-9) and West Virginia
(28-10). Last week they bounced
back to down Holy .Cross 46-0.
Coach Rip E_ngle has cautioned
his players to “forget all this
talk of bowls and concentrate on
the difficult task at hand.” He
also stated, “To sell this under-
_r.ated and fast improving Pitt
team short would be simply dis-
astrous.”‘

‘The Panthers hold the all—time
series (32-23-3) but. Engle has
the edge in the most recent
battles. His teams have won ﬁve,
lost three and tied once. The
Lions won last year’s contest 25-
21 and killed the Panthers hopes
for a Gator Bowl bid. .

The two teams have met two
similar opponents: West Virginia
and‘ Syracuse. State ‘has faired
better in both battles. State whip-
ped West Virginia, 28-10 while
the Panthers lost, 23-15. Against
Syracuse State lost by two while
the Panthers trailed by 35.

An interesting side-light of the
contest will be the battle between
Lucas and Jim Kerr for individual

I J Mike's‘ Critics
  Silent After Two
_ Straight Wins

By TED COLTON

/

Three weeks ago the wolves were howling for John
Michelosen’s skin. Now things seem to _be quite. What hap-
pened to all those anti-Michelosen experts who hanged him in
effigy in the wee hours of the morning because they were too‘
afraid to do it in the open?_ ‘

I didn’t see any signs at the Notre Dame game saying
“take a hike Mike,” But that Wasn’t unusual because it was
kind of cold and it did rain most of the afternoon which kept
those warm weather fans at home. .

They were quick to Jump on Michelosen’s back when the
Panthers dropped three in a row but I haven’t heard any 0
them give John the credit for the laskt two wins. 

* >l= * '

The truth of the matter is that Mike may be turning in
his best coaching job in the ﬁve seasons he has.been.here
at Pitt, Preseason picks had the Panthers ﬁnishing with a
5-5 mark or a 4-6 record. They pointed out that the lack of
experience in the middle of the l.ine and the lack of depth
at quarterback would hurt the Cats.

All‘ this was very true as Quarterback Ivan Toncic
started the season with a bad knee and the middle of the line
did very little to give Ivan the protection he needed. The re-

, sult was a 3-4 record after the Syracuse game. The future
looked very dim.

All of a sudden the Panthers came up with two backs
that ran like all-Americans, kicked liked a ‘couple of refugees
from a soccer game and came through with key plays that.

* * * it

In two short weeks the Panthers were transformed from

a poor team to one that is given a better than even chance

‘xto upset mighty Penn State which lost by only two points to
the number one team in the nation.

What happen in those‘two weeks? Well for one thing two
backs recovered from injuries that had been bothering them
most of the season. Jim Cunningham and Bob Clemens were
now available for full time duty in the backﬁeld. Fred Cox
was promoted to the ﬁrst team probably because _Norton
Seaman was injured and Michelosen needed someone in there
to handle the kicking chores.

Well they haven’t been able to get Cox out of there yet.

And if he continues to run the way he has beengwe might

see a lot of him in the next two years. Another factor was

' the improved play in the middle of the line. Two sophomores
Larry Vignali and Regis Coustillac mide the*difference.

=l= =l= =l= ’

_ They have both improved to the point Where they are no
longer inexperienced linemen. Now they can hold their own
with ‘the best of them. The Sats’ backﬁeld began to jell and
a smooth running attack was the result. The blocking be-
came ‘well coordinated and big holes appeared in the op-
ponents’ line. The Panthers are now. a good football team.

Looking back over the season they‘ could very easily be
in the running for a bowl bid. A victory over West Virginia
would have given the Cats a 6-3 mark with State coming next.

'Lets give John Michelosen the credit. It is his team. If
we are going to blame him for their losses lets praise him
for their Wins. — '

Saturday the Panthers will meet the bowl bound Lions.
Michelosen will be faced with the task of setting up a de-
fense to stop Richie Lucas. Two years ago Syracuse came to
town with Jim Brown, perhaps the greatest football player
today. The Panthers stopped him and I’m betting Michelosen’s
crew will stop Lucas and ﬁnish the season with a 6-4 record,

. Pitt Chest will be received.

Black Back for State, Others Green;
Locals Taut Top Secret Sensation

What promises to be on the highlights of the current
football season will unfold at Forbes Field on Saturday morn-
ing. That’s the second annual Blood Bowl, featuring the
squads of the Pitt News and the" Penn State Daily Collegian.

The teams will battle beginning at 9 a.m. as’ a preliminary
to the Pitt-Penn State game in the afternoon, The Blood
-Bowl was originated last year. 0 V

In that first bloody battle, the
Collegian Cowards blanked the
News Hawks, 26-0, on a cold
windy morning. The Cowards
were paced that day by Johnny
Black ,who was a transfer stu-
dent frori USC where he starred
on the Trojan freshman squad.
After he scored 25 of his team’s
26 points, Black was described
by the’ Hawks as,“better than
Richie Lucas.” Black is back this
year. Other ‘than him,_ however,
the Collegian six will be depend-
ing on many newcomers, includ-
ing Sports Editor Sandy Padwe.
Also new is Managing Editor
Bill Jaffe, Editor Dennis Malick
and Bobbi Levine, who is being
-touted as’the “secret weapon in,’
the line.” The ‘News squad also

"'All. IS NOT GOLD"

Seems like everybody had a crack at this piece

V of homely philosophy, but the originator seems
to be Geoffrey Chaucenin "The House of
Fame", Book I: ’

. "Hy! is not all gold that glarerli"

"COUNT IO..." ‘

Was there any limit to the talents of Thomas
Jefferson? Statesman, scientist, architect—he also
authored this admonition: V -'

"When angry, count ten before you speak; J *
if very angry, a hundred."

J A Joc_I5eDq® -T-Shirts

The most respected, creative name in underwear is Jockey
brand. It stands to reason, then, that Jockey brand T-shirts
are unmatched for quality as well as styling. You can
choose from standard crew neck T-shirt, "taper~tee" shirt,
~— sleeveless l~shirt, c’rn‘d'V-neck T~shirt models. Every man

- ' needs a drawer full of T-shirts—and the label to look for
is Jockey brand. Let it guide you to the world's finest

fashioned by the house of

 

job because he was afraid an-
other loss might mean he would
be hanged in effigy. Chass’ only
comment about the game was:
“You’ve heard about Syracuse’:
sizeable seven. Well, we’re the
scared six.”

,Other probable starters besides
Chass and Colton are Dave Le-
vine, Tom Reich and Joel Filner.
Coach Colton revealed his squad
has a secret weapon waiting for

the conﬁdent Cowards. “We have ‘

something" more powerful than

Ingemar J ohansson_’s right, Colton ‘

said. V. ,
The Pitt News also is touting
their own - version of LSU’s

This group is

known as the “Kamikaze Kats.”
The’winner ‘of the Blood Bowl
will receive a trophy which meas-
-ures about ﬁve feet, four inches
high and 36-26-36.

Rush 22nd

For the second consecutive
year it was Michigan State
which captured the ICAAAA
trophy on Monday. State was
very strong in every event
and had an especially strong
weapon in the person of Crawford
Kennedy who placed ﬁrst in the
IC4A for the second consecutive
year.

But as for the Panther Harriers
their showing was anything other
than impressive. With a total. of
480 points ‘the Blue and Gold
netted 19th place "out of a ﬁeld of
25 contenders.

Ron Rush," top Panther har-
rier, ﬁnished highest of his
teammates and 22nd in the ﬁeld.
Reed Clarke placed 88th, Mickey
Jupina came in 138th, Bob Stuck
ﬁnished 143rd and Bill ﬂinch-
berger swept ‘across the ﬁnish
line in 145th place.

_ When compared to the varsity’s
showing the fresh harriers looked
good. In a_ﬁeld of 20 teams par-
ticipating the frosh captured a
sixth place, only trailing the win-
ning St. John’s harriers by ‘six
points. The frosh--were nosed out
of ﬁfth place by the virtue of four
points by the Manhattan frosh,
164.-160. ~

Harryistokes placed seventh in
the ﬁeld followed by his team-'
mate Vince Carter 28th, John
Pringle, 34th, Jon. Hart- 38th and
John‘ Downe who ﬁnished the
course 84th.

I Coach Carl Rees commenting
upon the meet had this to say,
“I was very disappointed with
the showing we made. 71 felt
sure that we had much greater
capabilities than we showed.

“In my opinion the team just
beat themselves, they could have
done it if they had wanted to but
the spirit was just lacking.” ,

Rees commented about next

year’s team, “We’re going to be»

without the services of the team’s
best ﬁrst place runner, Ron Rush,
but I feel we have the material
and should be a big contender.”

Haggerty Still On

Top in Yogi Race; '
News Sure Win

As the Yogi race moves into its
ﬁnal it's Larry (the old -pro) Hag-
gerty out in front of the ﬁeld
leading the player by a mere ten
percentage points.

Colton and the player tied for
top picking honors last week, but
despite Colton’s good showing he
only holds the sixth rung on the
Yogum Role. ‘ -

This week both Jack Smith and
Colton have gone for the slightest
possible upsets in a ﬁnal last
ditch attempt to get back into
the running for the coveted Yogi
award.

According to the crystal balls
of the Yogis, Pitt is the big favor-
ite to pull an upset over the Lions

of Penn State.
