Colony looks to join
Greek community

While some pledges on campus
were trying to make it through the
infamous “Hell Week” last semester
for their fraternities, the new mem-
bers of Delta Chi joined their broth-
ers to play a_ football game on the
Cathedral of Learning’s lawn. S

Last fall was the first semester
for the anti—hazing colony on Pitt’s
campus. 

John Martin, the group’s presi-
dent, began working to create a
Delta Chi chapter at Pitt last May.

“What we were looking for was-

Delta Chi fraternity embodies the
qualities of academic excellence, he
said. i

The nearest local chapter, at
Duquesne University, runs a charity
event called “Can the Van,” where
they take canned goods to local
food banks. '

Martin hopes Pitt’s group will
be able to organize similar charity
events in the future. ‘

“We are looking forward to
being a part of the Greek
Community,” he said.

Matt Killingsworth, director of
chapter services for Delta Chi, has
worked with the founders of Pitt’s

Medicare choices   now limited

ANDY MEDICI
Staff Writer

The future of Medicare
was discussed and analyzed

on Wednesday in the first lec-

ture this semester as part of a
series sponsored by the
Health Policy Institute.

Marsha Gold, ‘a senior
fellow at Mathematica Policy
Research, gave the lecture.
The research institute is a
non-partisan firm that gathers
information for state and fed-
eral government agencies as
well as for companies in the
private sectors.
I One of themany issues
that Gold focused on was
people’s lack of knowledge
about the options available to
those on Medicare.

“People on Medicare

 

JP and the rest
of the men ’s
basketball
team go for 18.

 
   
     

have historically not thought
about choice.” Gold said.

That may not be much of
a problem for long, as
Mathematica has tracked the
decreasing amount of options
available since 1999.

According to data from
their studies, the percentage
of people living in urban
areas with access to three or
more different plans has fall-
en from more than 60 percent
to 49 percent during the past
five years. '

For those who live in
rural areas, there may be no
plans available, forcing peo-
ple to pay the full cost of
medical bills.

“They have taken an active

Delta Chi does not haze pledges
before they become full members.

“We feel the best way to estab-
lish a fraternity is to build. members
up, not tear them down,”
Killingsworth said.

“Unfortunately, with hazing, the
perception of it does damage.”

That was one of the factors that
led sophomore Matt Barron to join
Delta Chi during the fall.

“Hazing really just perpetuates
the idea that the status of ‘brother’
must be earned,” Barron said.

.When Barron came to college,
he wanted to join a fraternity.

After reading about Delta Chi,
he was impressed by the work—hard,
play-hard mentality.

“[I hoped to] not join a frat just
to join one, but to join one with a

he added.

Some of the famous alumni of
the fraternity include President
Benjamin Harrison, William
Jennings Bryan, Kevin Costner and
Ashton Kutcher.

Martin also pointed out that
academics will be one of Delta
Chi’s main concerns.

“Everyone is going tohave to
realize academics remain priority,”
Martin said.

But he said he also realizes the
need for more than just strong aca-
demic achievement in a fraternity.

“We want, everyone to be bal-
anced,” Martin said.

Barron said, “The current and
future members of Delta Chi have
[been], and will continue to be,
respected for the quality of their

character and the commitment they

show not_ only to Delta Chi, but in
all of the goals they pursue.”

Council

In an effort to get Pittsburgh back
in the black, the Pittsburgh City
Council approved hiking parking taxes
50 percent, which will affect com-
muters Downtown and in other busi-
ness areas.

The city, already deeply in debt,
seems not to know how to raise rev-
enue. _

Raising parking taxes, which
forced the
Authority to raise its, rates, will lower
revenues by driving away potential
customers.

Stores Downtown already have to

compete with suburban‘ shops and 2

malls; making parking more expensive
than it is will dissuade most customers
from coming into the city.

Under the Parking Authority’s new
rates, all-day parking will cost between
$1 and $3 more than it currentlyidoes,
and off-street metered parking lots’
rates doubled to $0.25 for 15 minutes,
according to the Jan. 15 Pittsburgh
Post-Gazette. . «

As students, every cent matters.
This 15 rninute-fee could mean that a
package of ramen goes un—purchased
or a quarter draft goes un—drunk —— and
that’s enough to convince most stu-
dents, to shop elsewhere.

Of course, with pa Pitt ID comes a
bus pass, but the Port Authority’s ever-
changing schedule can make shoppin
difficult. .1 . ~*

And Oakland, as abusiness dis-
trict, may be hurt by these changes.

"Many Pitt students commute and do

not have the extra money to pay these

new rates. Still others who patronize’

Oakland may take their business else-
where. ". ,
Money is tight at every level —
local, state and nationally. Pittsburgh
has clearly been hurt by this shortage,
as indicated by the city’s massive debt,

‘but cutting services and making current

services more expensive will not reme-
dy this.

_ Instead, this proposal, which
Mayor Tom. Murphy is expected to
sign, will drive consumers — and
resultantly, businesses — out of the
city.

Pittsburgh is rapidly becoming a
place people don’t want to live. In
addition to being the United States’
worst city to be single in, it c_annot
‘afford basic services like crossing
guards and bulk trash pick-up.

If the city’ wants Pitt students to
remain here, it needs to improve, not
out, ‘current programs, and make com-
muting less onerous.

"The City Council had the right idea

'— raising revenues.

But this is clearly not the way to go
about it. L

Murphy should veto raising park-
ing taxes, and instead propose a more
feasible way to raise revenue.

spend winter break.

During freshman year, I had tried
my hand at ﬁnding a three-week job,
but came up empty-handed. Last
year, ‘I didn’t even do that, and I
spent the entire recess parked in front
of the television, taking in as many
showings of “A Christmas Story” _as
TNT could muster. -

But the week before ﬁnals start-
ed, I knew this break would be dif-
ferent.

It was during that week that I
received an e-mail from two high
school friends. They planned to gath-
er a group of people and spend win-
ter vacation making a short ﬁlm.
They’d done thesame thing last year,
but I hadn’t heard about it soon
enough to become seriously
involved. Now they asked me to par-

ticipate. I gave them a tentative OK. T

After ﬁnals,_ I left school worn
down and depressed, having weath-
ered my most difﬁcult semester ever,
and looking forward to focusing my
attention and effort into something
completely different. I wasn’t going
to get a job or sit in front of the TV;
I was going to join the ranks of ambi-
tious, overachieving collegestudents
‘and do something productive and

. worthwhile with my time off.

 

I was going to help make a

a principal cast member, I
did have a bit part as a
singing, dancing, hockey
goalie in a chorus line of
mismatched, obscure .
characters, including a
bandito, a drag queen, a
Marine, a disheveled
businessman and a K-
Mart employee. This role
involved a lot of falling
down, but I was up for
that.

But most of my time
was spent behind the camera as the

boom operator. It sounds complex,.

but‘ it just involves holding the
microphone up for long periods of
time and angling it in a certain way.
My other duties included con-
vincing a Pittsburgh city police ofﬁ-
cer to park his car in front of Giant
Eagle and turn on the light bar so that
we could ﬁlm it, occasionally hold-
ing the slate in front ofthe camera,
driving all over suburban

FRIDAY. JANUARY 16, 2004 Getting Pitt students out of their rooms since 1906 PAGE 7

CHRISTINA CANN
Staff Writer

boice—Terrel Allen is a native
Pittsburgher who’s been making quite
a splash in the literary world. His latest
project is’ a multicultural anthology,
“Coloring Book: An. Eclectic
Anthology of Fiction & Poetry by
Multicultural Writers,” which he edit-
ed. As author Gregory Maguire says,
“Whatdoes ‘Coloring Book’ do but
suggest [that] the best of life consists
of coloring outside the lines? In this
admirable compendium of fresh
voices, sharp visions, writers
once considered on the
margins or beyond are
shown to be pertinent.
Impressive, urgent,
and rewarding.”
Allen found time
to discuss the
anthology and
the notion of
multiculturalism
in our society.

Why did you
decide to do a mul-

gy?

I ‘decided to compile an
anthology because so many of .
the existing ones are unified by a par-
ticular style or, if it’s a general anthol-
ogy, they only feature a token writer of
color, women, sexual orientation, etc. I
wanted, to create an anthology that was
expansive in its scope in terms of '
writing styles and also in its repre-
sentation of people from all walks
of life.

Were there certain criteria
you were searching for in the
stories and poems?

I’m very instinctive, and
the majority of the selections
were chosen if I got excited
while_I was reading them. I
was also interested in choos-
ing pieces that would pro-
duce a reaction in readers —
both positive and negative
—— that would be immediate. As onepof
the contributors said, the book “siz-
zles.” This was my goal.

What has been the general response
to the anthology? I

The response has been amazing.
It’s been selling briskly on
Amazon.com and on my Web site. I’ve
been getting over 1000 hits a month on
RattleCat.com. I’m most excited that
the contributors are pleased with it. I
feel honored that so many talented
writers have trusted me with their
work.

Do you believe enough diversity is
shown in the media today?

I think if the question has to be
asked, that means there

isn’t enough diversi-

ty in the media.
There’s still
an absence
of cul-
tures
out-

side of the mainstream that don’t get
represented. My anthology is a speck
to rectify that.

Do you feel that readers tend to‘

judge books based, at least in part,
by the race/gender/sexual

identity/etc. of an author?

Yes. I continually get asked, “Are
your books autographical?” Unless
you personally know me and every-
thing in my life, how is this question
relevant to your life? I think people
find it comforting that a story is based
in real life. Perhaps they feel they
know the author better. And often, it’s
impossible to answer the question yes
or no because a grain of truth, once it’s
ﬁltered through an author’s imagina-
tion, doesn’t even resemble its origin,
so it doesn’t serve the reader much use
to know its basis.

W h a t
intrigues

about
a fiction
' and poetry?

I love

f i c t i o n

because every time a novelist writes a
book, they’ve created a world that did-
n’t previously exist. You could give 20
different writers the same topic, and
they would produce 20 different
worlds. In poetry, I love the fact that
the complexities of life, emotions,

  This multiculturalanthology “sizzles”

relationships, etc. are boiled down
without being trivialized, that a poem
can unfold a whole world in the same
way that a 200—page book can.

Who inﬂuenced you to become a
novelist?

My mentor and professor at NYU,
Edwin. Diamond, encouraged me to
write a novel during a midterm evalua-
tion..It was his words of support that
ﬁnally stopped me from being one of
those people who just dream about
writing a novel. A few -weeks later, I
started writing my first unpublished
book that was loosely based on my late
—grandmother’s early life.

Do you have any advice foraspiring
authors?

For writers or any artist, you have
to persevere through the rejections and
naysayers. Everyone won’t believe in
your work, but you have to believe you
have something to offer regardless.
Basically, it means to keep writing,
keep sending your work out and, if you
get tired of rejection slips, publish
y o u r s e l f .

R e l e a s in g
your own work has

worked for musicians; it’s
time that more writers take that route

- instead of waiting for others. to validate

you. Many of the same opportunities
I’ve been afforded are the same ones as
authors with major publishers. Readers
just want to read good books. They
don’t care who publishes them.

A gentleman looks across the
dance floor as the needle is placed on
the record. There, in a smoky comer,
stands a woman dressed in red, staring
back at her partner from afar. He walks
toward her; she meets him halfway. At
that moment, the tango music begins.
The couple spins and twirls, wrapping
their legs around each other and
embracing cheek-to-cheek.

This couple_— along with many
other amateur ballroom dancers —
meets to celebrate their love for the art
of dance on a monthly basis. As mem-
bers of the United States Amateur
Ballroom Dancers Association of

V Pittsburgh (USABDA), they participate

in the non-profit organization to pro-
mote ballroom dancing. The l60—mem—
ber organization comes together to
learn new dance moves, meet new
dance partners and show off the multi-
talented organization.

Not only do couples meet on the
second Saturday of every month, but
singles also come’ to dance and meet
other people in a social atmosphere.
USABDA promotes dance awareness
and enjoyment in a communal setting
for all ages. Not only is this a national
club, but there are also local groups
that promote ballroom dance as a dance
sport.

On our Pitt campus, there are
dancers with dreams, of working their
way up in the dance sport competition
level. Likewise, Carnegie Mellon
University has a ballroom club, featur-

ing events such as “Strictly Ballroom,” ’

where the costumes and dance moves
spark interest from the audience — and
spark chemistry between dance part-
ners. '

The Cooler .

Starring William H. Macy, Maria
Bello, Alec Baldwin

Directed by Wayne Kramer
<£ni‘r1/2

Bernie Lootz (VV1lliam H. Macy)
walks the ﬂoor of the Shangri-La Casino,
day in and day out, turning winners into
losers. All he has to do is stand next to you,
and your luck runs out His own luck is so
bad, it’s contagious. He’s a “cooler,” a sad
relic of a bygone Las Vegas, one that didn’t
so closely resemble the Disneyland it is
today. Nowadays, we’re informed most
casinos employ such tactics as ambushing
gamblers with a looped, subsonic recording
of the word “lose.”

The Shangri-La, however, is the last
holdout of the old—school Vegas, which co-
Writer/director Wayne Kramer character-
izes as romantic — a classy place for classy
people — but also dangerous; an unforgiv-
ing place whene the powerful greet every
problem with violence. The man in charge,
Shelly (a menacing Alec Baldwin), a hard-
liner who maintains the coolness and cruel-
ness of the old days, will die before he sees
his casino turned into an amusement park

Bernie provides his services to the

Shangri-La in order to pay off the last of a
debt to Shelly. But when Bernie stumbles
into a love aﬁair with cocktail waitress
Natalie (Maria Bello) and becomes reac-
quainted with the emotion of happiness, he

‘ loses the ability to “cool.” Shelly isn’t will-

ing to let Bernie off the hook, though, and
becomes‘ determined to break the lovers
apart and screw Bernie’s life back up.
Newcomer Kramer’s style is assured,
but uneven. He keeps ‘both his storylines
interesting — the romance between Bernie

‘ and Natalie, which the director pumps with

whimsy and some unexpected eroticism,
and Shelly’s ﬁght to keep the Shangri-La
the way it’s always been, which he ﬁlls with
grimness —— but fails to make them feel like
they belong in the same movie.

For most of the ﬁlm, the performances
are enough to get us through the iffy
moments. Macy and Baldwin are high-

lights, the former being essentially a sure 0

thing these days, and the latter in the kind of
intense role he doesn’t play enough. Also,
Paul Sorvino is a nice bit of casting in the
small role of Buddy, the Shangri-La’s
Sinatra-school singer who’s addicted to
heroin and about to be replaced — by a
character played by a member of *NSYNC
(Joey Fatone), no less. .

By the end of the ﬁlm, though, the

actors’ chaims aren’t enough to keep us
invested. The ﬁlm goes on a bit too long,
and the plot turns get hard to swallow.
Oveiuse of the characters’ luck as a plot

device makes for a conclusion that lacks the A

Crazy from the Heat returns to say goodbye to 104.7 The Beat

The coming of a new year isusually the coming put on an FM channel?

of a new beginning. Witness people grasping des-
perately at New Year’s resolu-
tions as a means of wiping away
the bad taste —‘ and habits — of
the previous year. At times, these
resolutions are aimed at the prob-
lems that have plagued a person
for numerous years, even
decades.

But for 104.7 The Beat,
Pittsburgh’s jammin’ oldies chan-
nel that has been groovin’ the city
for the better part of four years,
the turn of the calendar meant an
end. As of Jan. 5, the channel
ceased to exist, and in its place
was the first FM news talk chan-
nel on Pittsburgh radio.

To quote Adam Sandler,
“Who are the ad wizards who
came up with this one?”

The Beat filled a void on Pittsburgh radio, a
landscape dominated by classic rock, modern rock
and obnoxious mainstream rap — and by the time
songs in the latter two categories made it here, they
were already old everywhere else around the coun-
try. The Beat, instead, played classics of hip-hop
and R&B, playing songs from as far back as the
‘60s and as recent as songs released a year or two
ago. Other than WAMO, which plays, for the most
part, new rap, hip-hop and R&B, no other channel
in the ‘Burgh had such programming.

And now it’s gone. Replaced by what? AM
radio fare that someone thought wasva good idea to

 

Dante A. Ciampaglia

A&E Editor

News talk has its place on the AM band. Rush
Limbaugh resideswthere. So does
Fred Honsberger, Mark Madden
and a slew of other ,loud—mouth
talking heads spouting off about
how bad liberals are while field-
ing calls from, disgruntled

Luther Vandross, Kem, Musiq
and the amazing DJ, a staple of
Pittsburgh radio for
Brother Matt. .

My disdain for this change
isn’t simply because I’ve lost a
radio station I’ve grown to con-
sider a close friend. It’s a big part
of it, obviously. But my feelings
on- the matter are fueled by the
knowledge that the hole The Beat

filled hasn’t only returned, it has -

grown bigger.

The black hole that is Pittsburgh radio has again
become homogenized. There are two channels for
light rock (929, 99.7), two channels for the MTV
set (93.7, 96.1), two channels for classic rock fans
(96.9, 102.5), two channels for young rockers
(102.5, 105.9) and a channel that ﬂoats somewhere
between them all (100.7, which should just become
an all ‘80s channel, but that’s neither here nor
there). ,

. Where’s the outlet for disco-era R&B? How can
Pittsburghers get their slow, sensual jam fix during

the night? Certainly not on B94. Excuse me, BZZ .

— B94 isn’t hip enough anymore, I guess.

 

Steelers fans. Please. Give me’

years,

Word on the, street is that the plug was pulled on
The Beat because of low ratings. And that might be
the case. It’s not my position that everyone loved
the station or its content. But there were a whole lot
of people who did.

And if the station was killed because of low rat-
ings, why ‘replace it with a news talk channel? That
isn’t exactly the epitome of a great idea. People
who listen to news talk subsist on AM, going to FM
only occasionally. What incentive do they have to
go to an FM news talk channel? To listen to Jim
Quinn or Michael Savage or that Hannity fella? If
talk radio fans want conservative propaganda,
they’,ll stick to Limbaugh, I’m sure.

For the past 10 years, 104.7 had some of the
most diverse programming on Pittsburgh radio.
Beginning with the Revolution, a channel somehow
obliterated by the X, despite the Revolution being
infinitely better, a smooth jazz station followed,
which was also quickly done away with.

The Beat was next in line, and we know what

. happened there. Is it the programming —— people in

Pittsburgh may not like anythingthat exists out of
their norms of Lynyrd Skynyrd and Pearl Jam — or
the station’s call number? Maybe 104.7 is like the
Thursday—night, 9:30-p.m. time slot on NBC — liv-
ing under the curse of having to follow “Seinfeld,”
even with “Seinfeld” off the air. Whatever the case,
The Beat doesn’t go on_and we’re the worse off for
it. Any memory of the station "willprobably rapidly
evaporate from the minds of most Pittsburghers —
like the Revolution and the smooth jazz did. But for
those of us who were fans of the station and its con-
tent, the sting of the gab coming off of 104.7 will
hurt for a long time. ‘ ‘

Less than ﬁve days after its exhilarating
74-71 win against Nome Dame the 13th-
ranked Pitt men’s basketball team faces off
against Rutgers on Saturday afternoon.

“[Ihe Notre Dame game] was an unbe-
lievable college game, with both teams bat-
tling and playing hard,” Pitt head coach
Jamie Dixon said. "lhe crowd was.unbe-
lievable. They pulled us through and were
absolutely tremendous.” _

Against the Fighting Irish, all ﬁve
starters for ﬂie Panthers scored in double ﬁg-
ures to help Pitt extend its home winning
streak to 36 games while furthering its sea-
sonrecordto l7-Oand3-0intl1eBigEast,
both national bests.

“We just try’ not to let [the streaks] get to
us,” senior  Jaron Brown, said. “[We]
just keep on playing the way we’ve been

18th straight win ‘

Brown and senior guard Julius Page led

I the Panthers with 19 and 18 points, respec-

tively, and sophomore guard Carl Krauser
added 15 points. '

“[Brown’s] always a big threat for us,
but it was Page who was pointing out the
mismatch and setting J aron 11p for those bas-
kets, which tells you how rmselﬁsh this team
is,” Dixon said “[Brown] is just a winner,
and he makes plays.” .

Against Pitt, None Dame junior guard
Chris Thomas scored 29 points, including a
Petersen Events Center record seven three-
pointers. Sophomore guard Chris Quinn
added 16 points for the Fighting Irish,
including four three-pointers.

“They hit some unbelievable shots,”
Dixonsaid. “We tip our hats to them They
shot the ball unbelievably.”

‘ the team decided not to’ renew

\_ How does a team go from
Super Bowl contender to hoping
to land a franchise quarterback in
the draft? ’

, Let’s take a quick and painful
stroll down memory laneand try
to figure out where things went
wrong for the Steelers. I

Personally, I believe the first
and worst mistake came when

veteran left tackle Wayne ‘Gandy’s contract, but
then opted to give right tackle Marvel Smith a new
deal when he still had a year remaining on his cur-
rent contract.

Why let your established left tackle, walk and
force your right tackle to change positions‘? Really
doesn’t make much sense when you consider the
fact that the Steelers could have held onto both
linemen for at least a year.

If there’s one thing Steelers’ fans should learn
from the 2003 season it’s that a strong offensive
line is the essential ingredient in any champi-
onship-caliber team. If your line can’t block, your
running back won’t have any holes to run through,
and your quarterback will not have time to find his
receivers. I ‘

And that’s not all.

Lack of offensive production means losing the
battle for time of possession, which equates ‘to

" things like, oh, say‘  a weak secondary being

 

exposed over and over again!
You can draw up all the X’s and
O’s you want, but the bottom
line is:‘ If you can’t get it done in
the trenches, you’re not going to
get it done anywhere else.
Smith switching sides
meant a vacancy at the right
tackle spot. Career back-up
Oliver Ross won that job, leav-
ing both - sides of the line
anchored by inexperienced players. ,
Then, just-before training camp, it became
known that promising second-year guard Kendall
Simmons had diabetes. Simmons managed to
make it through the season this year, but weight
loss and lack of energy hampered his play at right
guard. ' . ' I
As for Smith, he wasn’t quite as lucky.
Bothered by a pinched nerve in his neck, Smith,
who started in all 32 games in 2001 and 2002, only
started six games this past season. Injury is the
one part of the game that even the smartest men in
player personnel cannot predict.
Smith’s injury forced Pro Bowl guard Alan

, Faneca to slide over to left tackle. Despite spend-
ing most of the season ﬂopping between guard and -

tackle, Faneca will start ‘at guard in this year’s Pro
Bowl for the second consecutive season.
In short, the Steelers’ offensive line was noth-

ing‘ short of an absolute mess. With a struggling

Steelers should spend first draft pick on tackle

offensive line, the team needed its defense to play
mistake-free football. That is asking a lot of any
defensive unit, but with the players that this team
has in its secondary, the task proved to be too tall.

Next season, the team should be able to count
on both Smith and Simmons to return to form, but
it will still need to draft a player to fill the right
tackle spot. A healthy offensive line would have
meant more wins and, -with the AFC North as bad
as it was this year, probably would have given the
Steelers at least a playoff appearance.

The team has many problems to address this
off-season. Between defensive coordinator Tim
Lewis’ pink slip and offensive coordinator Mike
Mularkey accepting the head-coaching position in
Buffalo, the Steelers are looking at serious
changes in their offensive and defensive game
plans.

As much as the fans would love to see the

A Steelers take their quarterback of the future or a

replacement for Dewayne Washington in the first
round of this year’s draft, it is in the best interest
of the team’s immediate future to take a tackle.
The sooner the Steelers get their offensive line in
order, the sooner they will return to championship
contention.

News and is confident that Super Bowl XXXVIII

Pitt earns second straight Big
East victory with comeback

JIMMY JOHNSON
StaffWriter

Senior forward LaToya Kincaid
scored a career-high 29 points, as
the Panthers won at Seton Hall, 61-
56, for their second straight Big
East Conference win.

The Panthers (6-8 Overall, 2-2
Big East) found themselves in a
huge hole early in the game as

Seton Hall (10-4, 2-1) ran offsll .

unanswered points after the tip-off
to take a commanding 11-0 lead.

Pitt finally got on the score-
board, but still found itself down
16-4. The Panthers ended their
offensive silence and went on a 19-
3 run to finish the half. Senior
guard Stacy Moore tied the game at
the 2:07 mark when she hit a layup
after a Pirate turnover. She convert-
ed two free throws a minute later to
put Pitt up 21-19. It was the
Panthers’ first lead of the game, and
it was a lead they would not give
up.

However, the lead was in jeop-
ardy at times.

In the second half, Pitt had a 42-

-30 lead following a layup by

Kincaid with 10:43 on the clock,
but Seton Hall went on an 8-Orun to
cut the lead to four points.

’ Pitt countered and regained
their double-digit lead, going up 51-
41, with under five minutes to go.

The Pirates would again out the

lead, and this time, they cut it clos-
er. With one minute remaining,
Seton Hall forward Ashley Bush hit
two free throws to pull the Pirates
within one point, at 55-54.

On the next Panther possession,
Kincaid hit a turn-around jumper to
give Pitt a three-point lead. Two
free throws from_ sophomore guard
Katie Histed and two more from
freshman guard Brooke Hughes
sealed the victory for the Panthers.

GRE Review

 

  

Panthers have beaten the Scarlet Knights
soundly in their last two visits to Pitt

Men’s, page 11

While the Panﬂrers have won their last
two games by a total of seven points, less
than ﬁve points have decided the Scarlet
Knights’ (9-4 Overall, 1-2 Big East) last two
games. Rutgers beat Monmouth on Tuesday
evening by a score of 78-75 in overtime
while defeating then-No. 25 Providence on
Saturday, 65-64.

Against Monmouth, Herve Lamizana’s
18 points and SeanAxani’s 11 rebounds led
the Scarlet Knights. Lamizana’s 18 points
was nearly ﬁve points above his season aver-
age. Against Providence, Lamizana scored
21 points, including the game-winning shot
as time expired, and collected eight boards
for Rutgers.

“Well, I’ve been playing against Herve
[Lamizana] since AAU, and I remember
him from last year,” Page said “We can’t let
himgocrazyandgetoutthereandstarthit-
ting shots because it’s going to be a long
night for us. So as long as wejurnp on him
before he jumps on us, we’ll be able to con-

Additionally, Ricky Shields averages
14.5 points per game for the Scarlet Knights,
and Quincy Douby contributes nearly ten
points per contest oil’ the bench.

Whﬂe Rutgers has lost to such teams as

Wisconsin, Texas—El Paso, and Georgetown,
its one-point loss to No. 1-ranked
Connecticut proves it carmot be a team that
Pitt can take lightly.

Also, considering the Panthers’ much
anticipated dates at Connecticut and at
Syracuse next week, Pitt must be careful not
to overlook its game with the Scarlet
Knights. However, Krauser is conﬁdent that
the Panthers will not look past Rutgers on
Saturday.

“We know what we have to do,”
Krauser said. “We’ve been preparing for
Rutgers. We know that they’re a good team
and that they almost knocked off No. 1
UCOHIL We know what they’re capable of,
sowe wanttogooutthere andgive ourbest
focus andpractice andtrytogetawin”

In 2002, Rutgers lost to the Panthers 78-
59 at Fitzgerald Field House, while last year
they werebeat 86-65 at the Petersen Events
Center. Regardless of the situation, freshman
forward Chris Taft is looking forward to
playing again in front a raucous Petersen
Events Center crowd

“It’s unbelievable with the crowd going
crazy,” Taft said “I love college, and the
atmosphere is great”

The game is scheduled to tip—off at noon
on Jan. 17, and it will be televised on
WTAE—TV.
