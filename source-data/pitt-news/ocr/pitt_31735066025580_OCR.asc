Professor receives first '98 Olympc medal

Elaine Clifford

For The Pltt News

Dr. Savio Lau-Yaun Woo, an avid
skier, ﬂew home last night from New
York, where he was awarded a gold medal
in the Nagano Winter Olympics, but he’s
never even competed in an Olympic
event. -

The Pitt professor arrived from the
black—tie affair with the common tale of
rubbery chicken, good wine and a not-so-
typical cash prize of $250,000.

Woo, director of musculoskeletal
research at the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center, won this prestigious
award for his biomechanical joint
research. V

“I don’t like people to call me a
researcher; it would be my greatest disap-
pointment to be known as just a
researcher. I’m a teacher,” Woo pleaded.

More than 30 other scientists compet-
ed with Woo for the International Olympic
Committee gold medal for sports science,
a prize that honors extraordinary scientific
research. The IOC Olympic prize is the
highest award of merit given in the ﬁeld of
sports sciences.

Woo’s use of computer imaging and

Monica Mayk
For The Pitt News

It's a new year, and while stu-
dents vow to eat healthier, exercise
and improve their grades, Pitt's Food
Services wants to help students with
1998 resolutions by serving more
healthful foods.

Students complained about a lack
of vegetarian options and wanted new
choices, and, as a result, Food
Services and Sodexho are exploring
vegetarian and vegan options.

Betsy Sallade-Farina, director of
Food Services, said that according to
surveys conducted by her office, 25
percent of students want healthy
foods. "But healthy food means
something different to everyone," she
said.

Because of comment cards sub-
mitted by students, the C-Side cafete-
ria will feature new leafy greens on
Monday, including spinach, romaine,
bib and leaf lettuces. These new let-
tuces have more nutrients than ice-
berg lettuce —— students’ main com-
plaint about the salad — but iceberg
lettuce will remain for traditional
salad eaters.

C-Side manager Gary Shultis
claimed, however, that upgrading the
menu with student suggestions and
recipe submissions takes time
because the executive chef must
rework the recipes to accommodate
large volumes of people.

Since August, Schenley Cafe has
advertised “strollers” — exotic sand-
wiches consisting of various ﬂavors
of deli salads (chicken, Santa Fe,
black bean, etc.) wrapped in herb or
vegetable soft tortillas.

- But employees instead substitut-
ed regular sandwich meats because
they did not have the deli salads.
Student complaints prompted Food
Services to finally provide these
menu items beginning Monday.

From time to time, Sutherland
cafeteria offers “tastebreakers” -
new foods that managers’ will incor-
porate into the regular menu choices
if students react positively. Yesterday,
for instance, the cafeteria offered
steak and chicken Caesar salads.

In an effort to portray a more
restaurant—like style, C-Side chefs
now are carving higher-quality meats
right in front of the students.

"We've been challenged [by stu-
dents] to rise to higher expectations,"
said Shultis. "I think students have
become better-educated consumers
because of what goes on in the retail
world. That didn't exist 10 years
ago."

Sophomore business and psy-
chology major Charles Verruggio
said, "I think the quality should be 40
to 50 percent higher. I don't think
they do enough to make the food
right. I don't think they take enough
pride in their work.”

Patrick Rall, a freshman account-
ing major, said he gets the impression
that Sutherland Hall serves the same
food day after day.

"Monday we had pork chops and
Tuesday we had breaded pork chops,"
he said. "They have a tendency to
reuse everything and just deep fry it."

Sodexho managers said they use
student input such as comment cards
to gauge student interests.

Women suing Dow Chemicals for
bad breast implants win in court

Across the Nation

NEW ORLEANS Louisiana
women suing Dow Chemical over their
breast implants have won a round in
court.

A state judge ruled that a jury ver-
dict in one part of the case -— that Dow
lied about the risks of implants —
applies to the rest of the case. Unless
Dow gets the ruling overturned on
appeal, the 1,800 women making
claims won't have to prove negligence
again.

The plaintiffs will have to prove in
separate trials that their implants made
them sick and prove their damage.

But it's not clear where those claims
will be heard. They may go to a court in
Michigan, where Dow Corning is going
through bankruptcy proceedings.

Around the World

LONDON — Posters of an elderly
woman stripped to her underwear ﬁlled
British subways this week.

A photographer posed her own
mother, then put up the posters to make a
point. She says people are prejudiced
against older people, but she hopes they'll
change their attitudes when they see the
posters.

The artist says the images of her
mother are beautiful.

A spokeswoman for the Association
of Greater London Older Women agrees,
and says wrinkles give a body more char-
acter and expression. .

The woman featured on the poster
says she's glad to help her daughter but
she adds she's glad she lives in Germany
so nobody will recognize her pictures.

“Students are thrilled; they keep
thanking me for giving them that opportu-
nity,” said Saffron.

Before attending most off-campus
events, PITT ARTS participants will meet
with an expert on that tn'p’s art form.
Dance, theater or painting experts can pro-
vide them with a better understanding of
what the students will see. Usually, a
University—catered buffet will precede the
free transportation that PITT ARTS pro-
vides.

The bus is open to the public but was
designed with Pitt in mind to give students
the chance to attend arts events in the
North Side. Students and faculty can ride
the bus for free with their Pitt IDs and the
public can ride for the usual fare of $1.25.

FROM PAGE 1

Stops on the bus route connect Oakland,
downtown, and the North Side.

Schedules will appear in the Wrlliarn
Pitt Union on Friday.

PITT ARTS has already elicited a pos-
itive response from the local arts commu-
nity. The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust has
given Pitt graduate students the chance to
purchase 100 discounted tickets to arts
events in the "area. “The University is
building relations with the cultural institu-
tions. We hope more opportunities will be
offered to students,” Saffron said.

PITT ARTS coordinators plans on
publishing a booklet each semester with
information about local arts organizations,
programs, hours and student discounts.

ment, but his that colleagues and students
should get recognition for helping make it
reality.

“I think their goal was to honor scien-
tiﬁc research,” Woo said. “By being elect-
ed to receive the Olympic gold medal,
they must think we can make an impact on
humankind. We were just tickled to be
picked.”

The humble professor’s idea that
motion during recovery was good for the
healing process has been slowly imple-
mented over the last decade. His new
treatment makes surgical procedures for
torn knee ligaments obsolete.

“We don’t perform surgery; We use
soft splints, and the results are better with
this method [motion during recovery],”
said Woo.

“With surgery on the knee, you’re
looking at expensive hospital bills, missed
work days, and possible complications

from the immobilized, hard-casted leg,”
said Patrick Flyrm, a physical therapist at
the CORE Network, who works closely
with Pitt. “With Woo’s [nonsurgical] pro-
cedure, you aren’t hospitalized. You’re
moving around, and you heal quicker.”

On Feb. 2, W00 will be the first per-
son in Nagano, at the winter Olympic
Games to receive a medal.

Woo said he doesn’t plan to keep any
of the $250,000.

“My wife and I plan to put the money
back into various institutions devoted to
sports medicine and sports science. The
goal is to further education.”

He recalls with a chuckle, “When I
called my son at Vrllanova University, he
didn’t get excited about the money
because he knew I wouldn’t keep it to buy
that Lamborghini he’d like. Actually, he
was very excited about my winning the
Olympic medal.”

“I was the ﬁrst one,” revealed three—tirne
world—champion triathlete Mac Martin.His
whim of rtmning the structure's 36 accessible
ﬂoors led Martin to experiment beginning
when he was a student at Pitt, working as a
security night guard in the Cathedral.

“I was trying to make the ‘76 Olympic
bicycle trials and needed a brutal winter
workout. At the time, I was running  and
the stadium steps. Then running up the
Cathedral came to me one dark night of my
security career. After I started winning races,
the idea of step-running at Pitt kind of caught
on,” Martin explained.

The notion of running the Cathedral
steps shouldn’t intimidate the everyday ﬁt-

acknowledges, “even
though running the
Cathedral is both physi-
cally and mentally tax-
ing, most athletes with a
basic level of ﬁtness
should be able to make
it to the top at least
once.”

Then there are
those unique athletes
who subscribe to the
theory “more is better.”
In 1993, Chew and
Matt Meehan, one of the region’s elite multi-
sport athletes, challenged each other to a 12-
hour ,step—climbing marathon.

The premise was simple.

Whoever scaled the Cathedral steps the

ever, apparently didn’t ask
his rival for a copy of, his
resume, which boasts of

bicycle 425,000 miles dur-
ing his career.

Seven hours and 52 trips
into the arduous marathon,
Meehan retired. Chew,
meanwhile, felt that running
the remaining ﬁve hours by
himself even more challeng-
ing. Five hours after his
opponent had succumbed,
Chew’s total had swelled to 86 trips.

His unfathomable demonstration of
endurance saw the athlete climb 39,437 ver-

Meehan stresses that breaking Chew’s

nizes that step climbing “is the most intense
workout that someone can get in the winter,”
Meehan believes that a fall attempt may be
successful — “when I still have my summer

C—Side managers occasionally
randomly choose a student to act as a
"secret shopper" who surveys aspects
of the cafeteria such as presentation,
quality and service.

Eddie’s Account Manager Mike
Gwiazdowski said he talks to stu-
dents who bring individual problems
to his attention and recognizes that a
number of comments about the same
issue calls for a change.

"If it's 10 comment cards and
they all have the same problem, I just
need to i fix the problem," said
Gwiazdowski.

Eddie's responded‘ to student
requests by starting a soft pretzel sta-
tion located next to the frozen yogurt.
It promoted the pretzel varieties on
Tuesday with free samples.
Gwiazdowski said students must like
the pretzels because they buy so
many.

But some students are unaware
that Eddie's even sells soft pretzels.

"They have pretzels at Eddie's?"
asked John Bendick, a sophomore
engineering major.

Last Monday, Sutherland hyped a
new concept, "Sundaes on

PITT ARTS:
  Cl good start

. PITT ARTS, a new program developed by the
Office of the Provost, should begin to dispel that
ugly rumor that there’s nothing to do in Pittsburgh.

Begin, that is. There’s still a lot that Pitt can do
to improve the quality of student life.

But this is a good start.

Pitt and Port Authority Transit worked togeth-
er to develop a new Sunday bus route that will take
students directly to many of Pittsburgh’s cultural
highlights, including Heinz Hall, The Mattress
Factory and the Carnegie Science Center. Pitt also
will receive free tickets to events at these places to
distribute to students.

The idea apparently came from the administra-
tion’s new interest in student life. In an interview
at the beginning of last semester, Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg seemed quite excited about this topic
and keenly interested in pursuing it. _

Pitt’s done well, but it shouldn’t stop here.

For example, if student interest in this “cultur—
al bus” seems high, Pitt should convince PAT to
expand the service to Friday night and all day
Saturday. Many students use their Sunday after-
noons for homework (procrastinating to the last
minute as most of us do), and having more of the
weekend to pursue new activities would make this
possible for far more people. Also, evening service
might provide alternatives to the bar scene and
underage, weekend binge drinking. «

Pittsburgh is home to a lot more than what
most people think of when they hear “cultural
scene.” '

Let’s not forget the Civic Arena and Three
Rivers Stadium, to where Pitt could arrange free
bus rides for Pirate and Steeler games. Buses could
also be run from Pitt, through town, to the Starlake
Amphitheatre for both Pitt students and the gener-
al public alike.

Students would have a world of opportunities.

opened up to them if they could get around the
immediate vicinity more easily.

To that end, Pitt should seriously work on a
deal with PAT to accept student ID cards as Zone 1
bus passes. At the very least, the ID cards could
serve as weekend passes in Zone 1, which would
be much more useful than just the free rides to
downtown now available. Downtown is the hub,
but most of Pittsburgh’s highlights won’t be found
at the point.

The Pitt News

African doesn't mean poverty stricken

Matty
Mogapi

As I am African, I have
been subjected to more than
my fair share of American sen-
timents about the continent
with the shape of a question
mark.

Nothing amuses me more
than “questions” (which are
technically statements) that my
ears have fallen prey to in the
last four years while I have
lived the American experience
on this campus. .

Recently, over a bottle of
cheap wine and some
Hemingway’s cuisine, I sat
back in the midst of three
dean-listed friends who spoke
to me of African poverty. They
asked me and answered them-

. selves about African mud huts

and kraals and the lack of run-
ning water, not to mention the
nonexistence of electricity, and
they TOLD me how atrocious
and unlivable such conditions
must be.

Alas! My grandmother’s
existence, and mine, too, to
some extent (since I do visit
her in the village), were
appalling? And did they say a
“travesty”? On whose part I
wonder?

Many a time I have heard
such; initially it was to my irri-
tation, but lately it is to my
amusement. Poor souls, they
know not better, and with
American television, who can
blame them? «

I myself admit to having a
rather limited understanding of
the poverty in this country and
in my own, but I know there

are many dimensions to pover-
ty. I am of the humble opinion
that poverty is definitely not
the African village that is so
often cited as an example.

The African city, town or
slum may have within it pover-
ty. I cannot deny that there are
people who cannot afford to
have running water, and the
trip to the communal tap that
fills their pails is painful. I
know because at one stage of
my life I walked that path for
morning bathing water.

You do find people with no
electricity who have the need
for that modern amenity but
cannot afford it. I know this,
too, because my nearsighted-
ness didn’t gain from nights of
poring over some book with a
mere candle for illumination.
You do find people, children
even, with no shoes in the
thick of winter (yes, there are
winters there, too), and I know
this because my eyes have held
the vision of shivering babes
with cracked heels walking to
school.

There are times when I
have had to rouse a neighbor
from his sleep to ask for a cup
of sugar to sweeten my corn
meal porridge before going to
school because there wasn’t
money in our house for it. That
is poverty — material poverty.

If my friends had spoken
of this type of poverty and had
cited similar examples within a
similar context, they would
have been justified in their
sentiments. That is also
arguable because there is no
such thing as “African pover-
ty.” Poverty and suffering are

THE PITT NEWS

not always synonymous with
the motherland. Somewhere,
someone in America has a sim-
ilar story.

Definitions of poverty are
also relative. On whose stan-
dards do we base things like

poverty? What kind of poverty ’

are we speaking of? Do the
people in that context value
what we consider to be wealth?

I grew up, at different
stages of my life, materially
poor, but I don’t ever remem-
ber thinking of myself as being
poor. My family made sure we
were all wealthy in spirit,
heart, civility, reﬂection, expe-
rience, to mention but a few.

To those friends of mine
and to like minds, I have this to
say to you:

We in Africa are very
wealthy — yes, my grand-
mother’s mud hut is her white
house; her kraal with the
sounds of cows’ tails swishing
ﬂies away is her royal garden,
her river with its water that
cleanses and quenches her
thirst is her Perrier and her
paraffin lamp is her electricity.
Pity not her, for she is content.
She surveys her compound,
and it is her space to do what
she can and will with it.
African villages are most prob-
ably the few realities of our
times that are untouched by
poverty, for unlike the rest of
our existence, they are
untouched by the very
“wealthy” West.

POINT/COUNTERPOINT

 

Homosexuals deviant,
hold secret agenda

Paul Clark
Columnist

Homosexuals and homosexual
advocates refuse to ever consider or even
discuss the possibility that their actions
could be immoral or socially unaccept-
able. Most automatically assume that
because homosexuality is caused by
genes, does not involve a choice, and
feels good, this makes it right. But these
assumptions are flawed’

First, some studies indicate that envi-
ronmental factors cause homosexuality,
some indicate genes and some indicate
both. However, there exists no real deci-
sive evidence for either. The cause of
homosexuality remains unknown.

Second, one must differentiate feel-
' attracted

  

 

als have been treated 
Socarides. The results: 50 percent
stopped homosexual behavior through
therapy, and 25 percent stopped on their
own.

If two consenting adults do choose to
follow their feelings and engage in homo-
sexual activities, these persons should
factor into their decision the possible con-
sequences. According to the ACLU, in
the United States, most AIDS cases have
involved gay men, and the average 20-
year-old homosexual male has a 50-per-
cent chance of contracting AIDS. Clearly,
one should factor the chance of death into
any decision.

To demonstrate the above decision-
making logic, as a heterosexual male, it
would feel good for me to have sex with
numerous women. However, I choose to
abstain because of the risks of STDs and
pregnancy — consequences that Iarn not
willing to accept. If one chooses to com-
mit a homosexual act, one must be will-
ing to accept the consequences.

These consequences include not
only sexual diseases and death, but no
same—sex marriage and no live-in—lover
health care. Marriage exists as an institu-
tion between a man and a woman exclu-
sively. To extend this institution to same-
sex marriages legitimizes a choice that
opposes the moral values this nation
holds.

If people who make the choice to
commit homosexual acts do not enjoy
living in this one nation under God, they
should choose to live in another nation.

-.1 ,]v
,:4§i..

  

Concerning live—in lover health care, this
privilege is not offered to any live-in-
lovers, be they homosexual or heterosex-
ual. Laws solely designed to beneﬁt
homosexuals constitute a special right.
Even though medical expenses can be
extremely high for homosexuals,

nowhere in the Constitution does it state »

that anyone should receive any health-
care beneﬁts whatsoever, and, as such, no
one is entitled to health care.

The homosexual rhetoric would
have everyone believe that homosexuals
are struggling just to survive in this
oppressive world, and that without spe-

- ciﬁc rights, homosexuals will remain dis-

advantaged forever. According to The
Wall Street Journal, 60 percent of homo-
sexuals are college graduates, compared

nly nt of all ' ans and 5

  

  

agenda stands out as one "of e most

deceptive and militant agendas in history. »

The real homosexual agenda does not
simply seek safety ﬁom oppression or
simply recognition as a minority. The
ultimate goal of homosexual groups,
locally and nationally, is to make homo-
sexuality the majority, to replace moral
American values with gay values, to
transform the United States into the gay
nation.

They’re currently accomplishing this
through our children. Children’s
Animated Television is ‘producing gay
movies. Using kits supplied by gay advo-
cates, teachers are instructing Head Start
kids that it’s “almost worse” to have a
family that is without homosexuals.
Libraries are being stocked with chil-
dren’s books such as “Daddy’s
Roommate,” “Heather Has T‘wo
Mommies” and “Jessie’s Dreamskirt”
(featuring a cross-dressing boy).

If you do not believe my words, con-
sider the words of a publication of the
homosexual agenda, the “Gay
Revolutionary”:

“We shall sodornize your sons,
emblems of your feeble masculinity, of
your shallow dreams, and vulgarities. We
shall seduce them in your schools, in your
dormitories, in your gymnasiurns, in your
locker rooms  All churches who con-
derrm us will be closed. Our only gods
are handsome young men.”

Paul Clark thinks God made the world
for Adam and Eve, not Adam and Steve.

Alternative lifestyles not Cl

threat, none of my business

Columnlst

As a heterosexual, and a proud one at
that, I guess I really shouldn’t have to give a
ballyhoo about homosexuality; it doesn’t
aifect me, I’m not overcome by “gayness”
whenever I see Priest or Priscilla, Queen of
the Desert, and I don’t run for the hills when-
ever I see yet another case on television
where a gay couple is living with HIV, or
whatnot. If I’m not worried about what they
do, why should society, as a whole, be con-
cemed?

I belong to the school of thought which
believes a restriction of freedom on one
group of individuals is a restriction on us all.

I personally think with regard to sexual-
ity, everything should be allowed (though I

rtainl ul ' eﬁered),

     

having sex with a man be considered by a
huge portion of society to be the same as a
man having sex with a donkey or a cat or a
goat?

In 1998, American society may be con-
sidered liberal, but there are opponents of
homosexuality (who give it the grand title
“deviant sexual behavior,” which also
encompasses every single heterosexual sex
act baning the missionary position) out
there, and they can be voted back into power
at any moment.

Right—wing newspapers have talked of a
gay agenda. I’m sure they imagine a board
roomthinktankinaSanFranciscoofﬁce
building where a dozen gay men in pink
sheets and a dozen butch biker chicks plot
the destruction of heterosexuality as we
know it.

“Ellen DeGeneres and her carefully
plarmed media campaign will ensure that we
faggots run the Earth,” they’d imagine a man
in a faux leopard fur coat saying.

“Yeah. Dr. Richard Seed and his land-
mark scientiﬁc research with cloning have
taken away the excuse for those hetero bas-
tard deviants to have sex,” a 400-pound fem-
inist in black leather may say.

“That’s not all,” a bearded choreograph-
er in a pink leotard might declare. “In a
recent survey, we found that 17 percent of
American males age 18 to 25 have sexual
fantasies about Leonardo DiCaprio.”

Diabolical laughter would follow, as
well as toasts, with pinkies in the upright
position.

Right-wing Bible thumpers also use

  

      

their hallowed text as a reference.
References to the evils of homosexuality can
be found in the letters of Paul and that book
with the rules no one follows anyway
(Deuteronomy).

Christian homosexuals take solace in

the fact that Jesus is never quoted saying that 1

he hated homosexuals, although he did go
off on several diatribes about deviant behav-
ior, but never mentioned homosexuality.
And the letters of Paul to the Thessalonians
and the Collosians (the gist of which is,
“Your city sucks. This is how your church
will change things, in the name of my Lord,
of course”) are about as necessary to the
Bible as a supplemental section containing
letters by Hitler to Goering, Goebbels,
Speier and Himmler would be to an edition

of Mein Kampf And would Paul’s opinion

count. theword fGod

   

   

      

 

  

sex with another man is a lot more per-
missible than vaporizing 400,000 
with a nuclear bomb. How odd that people
who approve of $1 billion spy planes, chem-
ical warfare, nuclear missiles and sub-
marines believe that homosexuality is urmat-
ural and immoral.

A popular colloquial expression among
the barbarian sector of the right—wing for
homosexuals is (excuse my language)
AIDS-f—ker. I’m pretty sure that gay men
get involved in a relationship with another
man for something more than a game of
penile Russian roulette. I rather fancy gay
that men and women get involved with fel-
low gay men and women for pretty much
the same reasons that hetero men and
women get involved with hetero men and
women.

It took quite a while for these narrow-
minded types to accept that black people
were actually equal to white people in every-
thing, and they will come to realize that gay
people are not monsters who are on the plan-
et just to spread AIDS. I do not feel threat-
ened by their sexual behavior, and I do not
wish to tell them how they should behave
and in which oriﬁce they should stick what.

They should leave the 19th century
behind and accept that homosexuals are not
deviant and that they believe in concepts
such as monogamous relationships and love.

But it takes more than a ranting hetero
to change the minds of the ignorant.

James Maude does ﬁnd Val Kilmer to be a
handsome man but prefers Sarah Michelle
Gellar and Kate Winslet.

 

Pippen, Bulls up
for another ring

Print the T—shirts.

Roll the tape of Michael, Scottie and
Dennis dancing as confetti falls lightly on
their again—crowned heads.

Sports Illustrated, get cracking on that
video of amazing highlights and inside

information about the team that dominated

the ‘90s.

It’s over. Give the Chicago Bulls their
sixth NBA championship trophy.

When the armouncer at the United
Center bellowed those fateful words
Saturday night for the ﬁrst time this season,
you could almost hear the groan coming
from every other team in the NBA.

“At forward, from Central Arkansas,
No. 33, Scottie Pippen.”

Scottie Pippen is back, bum foot and all.

So are the real Chicago Bulls. -

The B.P., Before Pippen, Bulls were 24-
11, giving them the best record in the
Eastern Conference and the third-best
record in the league, behind only Seattle and
the Los Angeles Lakers.

Most teams in the league would kill to
be 24-11 35 games into the season — con-
sidering that some teams don’t win 24
games the entire year — but for the Bulls it’s
not acceptable. ‘

During their ﬁve championship seasons
the Bulls have dominated the league with
records of 67-15 in 1992, a league-record
72-10 in 1996 and 69-13 last season.

Now, although stranger things have
happened, it’s unlikely that the A.P. (After
Pippen) Bulls will go 43-2 over the last 45
games.

The B.P. problems were a distraction to
the Bulls’ coaches, players and management
since the beginning of the season and when
he threatened to never play for the Bulls
again it looked as if the dynasty had crum-
bled.

It has been no secret over the past few
years that Pippen is one of the most domi-
nating players in the NBA.

The problem for Pip is that he is also
one of the most underpaid based on what
some players are raking in these days.
Granted, Pippen didn’t approach his dissat-
isfaction with the front office in the best pos-
sible manner, but the fact remains that witli-
out Pippen, the Bulls wouldn’t be where
they are today.

Some say Michael Jordan made Scottie
Pippen and vice versa.

Who cares?

Certainly not anyone else on the team
that has won ﬁve of the past seven champi-
onships, missing out only in 1994 and 1995
when Hakeem Olajuwon and the Houston
Rockets won back-to-back titles while
Jordan dabbled with baseball. ‘

“I think some of our

Sales, who finished
with 30 on the night, also
commented that the

Rutgers game a family affair for Hoops’ Greer

Senior Staff Writer

When the Pitt Panthers men’s basket-
ball team (6-5, 1-3) meet the Rutgers
Scarlet Knights (7-6, 1-3) on Saturday, two
important bragging rights will be estab-
lished: One for the best guard in the Big
East Conference, and the other for the best
player in the Greer family.

' The game (7:30, Fox Sports
Pittsburgh) will feature the reunion of Jeﬂ°
and Ricardo Greer. While Jeﬂ° now plays
for Rutgers and his older brother Ricardo
plays for the Panthers, the similarities
between the brothers are striking: Both are
6-foot-7 forwards, and both have earned
starting positions in their freshrrian sea-
sons. The brothers should be able to relive
their backyard brawls when they do battle
against one another at the Fitzgerald Field
House.

In the other matchup to watch,
Rutgers will try to counter Pitt’s leading
scorer, Vonteego Cummings (19.6 ppg)

 

with a sharp shooter of its own. Geoff
Billet leads Rutgers in scoring (15.1 ppg)
and ranks second in assists (3.9 apg). The
6-0 junior is a marksman from the perime-
ter, hitting 39 of 85 from outside the three-
point line, good for a .459 clip.

Billet is one of three players who can
shot the ball from outside for Rutgers.
Along with sophomore guard Earl Johnson
and Greer, Rutgers presents a triple threat
for Currirnings, Ricardo Greer and Jarrett

' Lockhart to contain.

“They really shoot the ball well frorri

 the perimeter,” Head Coach Ralph Wﬂlard

   

said. In an effort to disrupt the Scarlet
Knights’ outside shooting, Willard said the
Panthers will rotate defenders on the
Rutgers trifecta. .
Inside the paint, Rutgers relies on Rob
Hodgson, a 6-7 forward who averages 5.1
rebounds per game and 12.7 points. He
will be paired alongside Panther forward
Isaac Hawkins, who is coming off consec-

-utive double-doubles.

“Issac’s stepped it up,” Willard said.

Lady Panther miscues multiply in the face of Huskies

Matt Mento
Staff Writer

Last night’s Big East battle between
the Lady Panthers and No. 3—ranked
Connecticut Huskies was all about give-
aways and takeaways. In its 83-46 loss,
Pitt gave away the ball while Connecticut
was taking it right out of the Panthers’
hands.

Pitt’s Monique Toney turned the ball
over 10 times en route to a team total of
31. The Lady Husky combo of Svetlana
Abrosimova and Nykesha Sales picked
the Panthers for four steals each. Entering
the contest, Sales ranked third in the Big
East with 47 steals, averaging about three
per game. She ranked behind teammate
Rita Williams, who averages 3.38 steals

per game. Williams recorded three against
Pitt. Abrosimova is sixth on the list aver-
aging 2.5 per game.

Abrosimova began the pickpocket
fest in the opening two minutes of the
game with back—to—back steals that led to
her own ﬁeld goals. Later in the period,
steals by Sales, Amy Duran and VV1lliams
sparked a 23-0 run by Connecticut that
held Pitt scoreless for over nine minutes.

Duran’s steal at the 13:27 mark jump-
started the Husky offense as she dished
off to Sales who made a layup to give
Connecticut a 12-11 lead. The Huskies
never looked back from there. Two con-
secutive steals followed, putting the
Huskies up by ﬁve. After a timeout, Stacy
Hansmyere stole the ball from Pitt and led
teammate Paige Sauer with a pass that

would continue the Husky scoring
onslaught for most of the first half.

The second half was not much better
for Pitt as it continued its sloppy play.
Abrosimova wasted little time in giving
the Panthers an opportunity to drive to the
net by recording her third steal of the
game. Sales followed with three more
steals in the next eight minutes. Her con--
sistent hustle and quick hands gave her a
team-high 30 points. Abrosimova and
Williams continued to battle for the Big
East lead in steals with picks in the ﬁnal
10 minutes of the game.

Connecticut had 19 turnovers of its
own in the contest. Abrosimova turned
the ball over six times herself. Hansmyere
had four in the game for the Lady
Huskies.

COLUMN

Imagine if M.J. hadn’t been asked to
leave the league by Commissioner David
Stern to take the heat olf of his gambling
accusations  oops  I mean decided he
had to walk away from the game.

Seven championships in a row would
have been likely, and as Pippen brings the
best team back to the forefront, it will be
rivaling the Boston Celtics as the most
dominant franchise in league history.

The Celtics have won a league-record
16 titles, including eight in a row from 1959
to 1966, but they haven’t won a champi-
onship since 1986 and aren’t close to
returning to the level of the Bill Russell,
Bob Cousy, Larry Bird and Kevin McHale
eras yet.

People will argue for eternity over

FROM PAGE 9

whether the Bulls are the greatest team of i

all time, and no clear—cut answer will ever
be reached, but what would that prove any-
way?

The great teams in Boston and Los
Angeles had men in the middle like Russell,
Robert Parish and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar.

Since the Bulls won their ﬁrst title in
1991, they have had centers like Bill
Cartwright, \V1ll Perdue and Luc Longley.

Not to take anything away from them,
but three of the greatest players of all time
certainly have the edge over a 7—foot mar-
tial-arts addict, a lanky, white oak who
makes soup commercials, and an

Australian who has missed games after suf-
fering boogie board accidents.

Last night the Bulls welcomed the
Seattle Supersonics, the team with the best
record in the league at 29-8, to the United
Center and sent them back home with a
101-91 loss.

Michael Jordan scored 40 points again,
giving him 40 or more in ﬁve of the past 10
games.

The retum of No. 33 will only make
that total rise.

In the ﬁrst 27 games of the season,
Jordan averaged 26.6 points per game, had
one game over 40 points; a 49-point, dou-
ble-overtime effort against the Clippers;
shot 42.5 percent from the ﬁeld and, the
Bulls had a winning percentage of .667.

Over the past 10 games he has picked
up his game to the nomral league-leading
levels he is known for“. 36 points per con-
test, ﬁve games of 40 points or more, a .502

 
  
 
 
 
 
 
   

shooting percentage. Of those 10 games the
Bulls have won eight

The only category Jordan has fallen oil“
in is All-Star voting. Before last week he
was leading the East in voting, but Detroit
guard/forward Grant Hill has overtaken
him with 276,092 votes — 1,687 more than
Jordan. I

Maybe more people will visit the are-
nas around the league and McDonald’s
restaurants across the nation to stuﬁ the bal-
lot box for Michael. Maybe not, but that
really doesn’t matter now.

The A.P. Bulls are together again, and
there is no team on earth, or on any other
planet for that matter, that can beat them.

PREVIEW

elfort, good things will happen.”

The emergence of Hawkins and shoot-
ing guard Lockhait has taken some of the
pressure off Cummings, who has been
asked to shoulder the Panthers’ scoring load
while also distributing the ball. Cummings’
primary backup at point guard, Kellii
Taylor, is questionable for Saturday’s game
with a soft-tissue problem in his ankle.

Scoring points will not come easily for
the Panthers, for Rutgers has earned a repu-
tation as one of the top defensive teams in
the conference. Its combination of a 3-2
matchup zone and man-to-man defense has
stiﬂed opponents. Rutgers is giving up just
61.1 points per game, good for second in
the Big East.

There were 92 people in Nick
Menge1iIik’s high school graduating class.
There are 26,000 people here at Pitt.

That’s the ﬁrst big difference between
Mengen'nk’s high—school and college days.

The second big difference? Mengerink
was the star of his high—school wrestling
team, but there’s a huge difference between
wrestling at a little high school and
wrestling at a big—time Division I college.
He’d never make it at this level, right?

Not quite. Mengerink, who’s in his first
year as a starter after sitting out all of last
season with a redshirt, has a record of 17-3
and captured first place in the 167—pound
weight class at the Lock Haven Invitational
earlier this season.

“He was from a small high school, so a
lot of teams overlooked him a little bit,” Pitt
Head Coach Rande Stottlemyer said. “But
we saw some things in him we liked. I made
a couple of visits to Ohio because we were
high on him all along.”

Despite putting together a 136-9 record

THE PITT NEWS

Freshman grappler Mengerink wows coaches, teammates

and bringing home the Ohio state champi-
onship twice during high school, a lot of
major colleges passed on recruiting
Mengerink. He competed in Ohio’s
Division HI — the smallest high—school
division, which is not a traditional hotbed of
wrestling talent.

But after his senior season, Mengerink
competed in the high-school nationals held
in Pittsburgh at Duquesne University.
Mengerink was the champion of the 152-
pound weight class and ﬁnally he started
getting the national attention he deserved.

“After I won nationals, a lot more
teams started looking at me,” Mengerink
explained. “But I was impressed because
Pitt was interested in me before that.”

It was his official recruiting visit to Pitt
that ﬁnally sold Mengerink on the school.
He was most impressed with the members
of the team, their attitude, and how he easi-
ly he could relate to them.

But even after he committed to Pitt,
Mengerink had to wait patiently for his turn
to showcase his talent. The plan was to red-
shirt him as a freshman to ease his transition
into the brutal world of college wrestling.

“I expected to be
redshirted last year. We
pretty much agreed on
that when I sign ,”
Mengerink said. “We
had Jake [Schaus] at
158 and [John]
Withrow at 167. The
smart thing for me to
do was save a year of
eligibility, work out
and try to get better,
and go out and get
some matches on my
own.”

Mengerink cer-
tainly made the most of
his redshirt year. He entered several open
tournaments to try and gain some experi-
ence. He ended up going 20-3.

But the main thing that helped to mold
Mengerink into a legitimate wrestling force
was his work ethic in the practice room. He
had the luxury of having some of the best
wrestlers in the country for workout part-
ners.
Not only did he go up against greats
like Bryan Matusic and All-Americans
Wltllf0W and Mark Bodo on a daily basis,
but Assistant Coaches Dan Payne and J.J.
Fasnacht also helped whip Mengerink into
top shape.

But after a long, tedious year out of the
spotlight, when the time came for
Mengerink to show what he could do, he
didn’t let anybody down.

 

He Said

Thursday, 15 January 1998

 

Mengeii_nk first
pulled on a Pittsburgh
singlet and took to the
mat in this year’s sea-
son opener against
Slippery Rock. He
dominated in an 8-1
major decision victory.

“It felt really
good to get out there,”
Mengerink said of his
ﬁrst varsity match. “It
sure beats sitting in the
stands.”

He hasn’t let up
since. This is especial-
ly impressive when
you consider the weight class in which he
wrestles.

pound weight class is one of the toughest to
compete in, especially for a first-year
wrestler, because almost all wrestlers in the
higher-weight classes are upperclassmen
with a lot of experience.

But Mengerink has wrestled at their
level —— even beating Harvard’s Ed Mosley,
the 1lth—ranked wrestler in the nation -
earlier this season at the Las Vegas
Invitational. _

“We have high expectations for Nick
and he’s ahead of schedule,” Stottlemyer
said. “But he’s got to keep doing the things
he’s doing because it’s not how you start the
race but how you cross the ﬁnish line that
matters.”

on the heels of Woods’ layup and
gave the Panthers a 7-6 lead.

“I was just wide open, and I hit
my shots tonight,” she said, thank-
ing teammate Nickeia Morris for
setting picks inside and fellow
guards Gina Montesano and
Monique Toney for driving toward
the basket and drawing Husky
defenders.

This simple offensive attack -
force the ball inside, then send it
back out to the 5—foot-6 guard
behind the arc -— was working well
in the beginning.

Then, the clock hit 14:02.

Sales made her layup. It was the
first two of 13 Sales points in the
next 10 minutes.

She would outscore Pitt 13-0 in
those minutes.

Deep into the run, Montesano
took it upon herself to sacrifice her
well-being to stop the team’s bleed-
ing

FROM PAGE 9

With the score 35-14, Sales
drove in for what looked like anoth-
er easy layup. Montesano cut in
front of the onrushing senior and
quickly planted her feet hard on the
Fitzgerald Field House’s hardwood.

After establishing position,
Montesano was promptly planted by

Lady-Panther freshman Monique Toney fends off Connecticut guard Rita Williams.

THE PITT NEWS

She drew the charge successfully

and got a loud ovation.

It was the lowlight of a run that

included‘ nearly every

turnover

The crowd, however, wasn’t
enough to spark a Panther turn-
around.

On the ensuing possession,
Montesano, Morris and Pitt junior
Kortni Webb all missed routine
layups before Connecticut finally
grabbed the ball and the momentum

imaginable; traveling calls, errant
passes, carrying violations and
UConn steals abounded.

On the game, the Lady Panthers
committed 31 turnovers. Starting
point guard Monique Toney led the
squad with 10, while Katkowski
committed 5 unforced errors.

  
   

 

guard LaTonya Blanton also com-
mitted five turnovers. The three Pitt
leaders combined easily outpaced
Connecticut’s team miscue total of
19. .
“You never want to say it’s
entirely your mistakes that make you
go,” said Pitt Head Coach Kirk
Bruce. “[The Huskies] make you
play the way you play.’’

Turnovers weren’t the only mis-
takes during the UConn run, or in
the game as a whole. At the end of
the first half, the Panthers were
shooting below 24 percent from the
field.

At the end of the game, they had
improved to 29 percent, despite a
.545 showing from behind the 3-
point line. Katkowski did most of
that damage herself, scoring on five
of eight outside the arc.

While Sales was the Connecticut
star, Bruce was quick to laud the
play of UConn rookie Svetlana
Abrosimova, who had 12 points and
eight rebounds.

“She’s what they need,” Bruce
said of the freshman out of St.
Petersburg, Russia. “A 6-1 girl that
can play the perimeter  kind of
sounds like Nykesha, doesn’t it?”

The Panthers look to rebound
this weekend when they play Seton
Hall in a Saturday contest at the
Field House. The game tips off at
