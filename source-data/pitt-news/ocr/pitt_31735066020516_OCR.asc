By Ann Cifra
The Pitt News

For people with problems ranging
from drug addiction to unwanted
pregnancy to coping with college
life, various telephone hotlines in the

| Pittsburgh area may help.

The helplines attempt to alleviate
emotional, mental and social prob-
lems encountered by Pittsburgh resi-
dents through counseling, referrals
and general information.

' One such telephone hotline is
CONTACT, a 24-hour. crisis inter-
vention and counseling line staffed
by trained volunteers. The line.is
open to all those who need help of
any kind. The volunteers offer sup-
portive listening to problems of a
long-standing nature, such as being
unable to cope with daily problems,
and to immediate difficulties, such

as theiloss of a job.

Dr. Oren Camp of CONTACT
says that the helpline is unique
because it receives a large variety of
calls and provides 24-hour service
with no answering machines.

“When one considers the emo-
tional turmoil in southwestern
Pennsylvania [due to socioeconomic
reasons], there's always a margin of

those who need help. We fill the gap. '

People find that the telephone is
convenient for seeking help,”_ Camp
said. _
CONTACT also runs a line for
disabled and elderly persons living
alone and will start a helpline for
“latch-key" children, those whose
parents work, leaving them home
alone for all or part of the day.

- “There is a support group for stu-
dents,” Camp added. “CONTACT
has helped many college students in
the past with various problems.”

In_ addition to helping callers, he
said, “Here might be an opportunity
for students to become volunteers

and to see what work in the non-
profit sector is like.” »

Another helpline, run by the the
Pittsburgh _Action Against Rape
Organization (PAAR), provides cri-
sis counseling and referrals to rape
victims.

While the line primarily provides
counseling, it also offers emergency
hospital escorts. The helpline is open
24 hours a day, seven days a week.

PAAR‘s’ line is staffed by female‘

volunteers trained to handle calls
from victims and others ‘concerned
with rape.

Robin Conners, crisis interven-
tion coordinator for PAAR, feels
that the line is important partly
because some people call but never
come in to the PAAR center to
receive assistance. “The anonymity
of calling makes it a lot easier to deal
with the issue initially,‘.’ Connors
says.

Mondale visits

Pittsburgh today

‘By Vincent Murphy
The Pitt News

Allegheny County Democratic
Headquarters Press Secretary Moss
Murphy was positive about presi-
dential candidate Walter Mondale's
potential success yesterday after-
noon before going to meet the candi-
date at the Pittsburgh International
Airport.

“The debate was a triumph," said

Murphy. “People now believe he .

[Mondale] could be president.“
Walter Mondale is due to speak
today at Market Square, downtown,
at noon. His arrival in Pittsburgh
marks what could be yet another
turning point in his campaign after
his successful televised debate on
Sunday evening. The Mondale cam-
paign in Pittsburgh is crucial
because of Pittsburgh’s image,
which epitomizes the urban areasin
need that Mondale referred to in his
Sunday debate when he stated, “We
have to work with cities and others
in order to help generate economic
growth in those communities.-"
Pittsburgh's reaction to Mon-
dale’s arrival, two days after_his suc-
cessful television debate, is much
more enthusiastic than predicted
only a week ago. The number of

volunteers for the Democratic cam- .

paign in Pittsburgh has quadrupled
from approximately 120 volunteers
to 450 since the debate on Sunday,
according to Murphy. Murphy
attributespthis increase to the fact
that Americans, until now, could
associate Mondale only with 20-
second news flashes on national tele-
vision. Murphy said he feels that
Mondale’s opportunity to be seen
foran extended period of time, one
on one against Reagan, has opened
the public's eyes.

“They met a Mondale who doesn't

want to spend everybody’s money,”

he said.
Larry Dunn,‘chairman of Alle-
gheny County‘s Republican Head-

quarters, had a different opinion of
the debate's outcome. “I feel Presi-

dent Reagan made the points he
needed to counter Mondale's misre-
presentations,” said Dunn. “I also
thought that stylistically it was a
draw.“ Dunn expects no major
change in Mondale’s approach to his
campaign in Pittsburgh after Sun-
day's debate.

What exactly will Mondale be
stressing in today’s talk at Market
Square? The image of Pittsburgh
does create the need for Mondale to
stress the issues of Reagan‘s deficits
and its relation to job losses. Men-

tioning his tax plan for protection of

lower-income families would also be
in his best interest. The forecasts by

the two major parties on exactly‘

what Mondale will aim at while in

Pittsburgh vary greatly, however.
According to Murphy, Mondale

“has to work for the best interests of

the people." Murphy feels that, of

course, the issues of minority rights,

labor and the deficit are in the inter-
ests of Pittsburgh residents and will
be stressed: However, most local‘
- democrats feel that after the debate
and vice presidential candidate Ger-

aldine Ferraro’s preliminary visit to
Pittsburgh last week, Mondale's talk
here should be fairly positive. He
will be defending his own policies
and should be less aggressive toward
those of President Reagan.

For the Republicans, Larry Dunn
expressed a radically different view
of Mondale's intentions in Pitts-
burgh. “I think he'll continue to try
to misrepresent the Social Security

Senate Council

adopts policy

The Senate Council unanimously
adopted a set of procedures at yes-
terday‘s meeting in which non-
tenure-stream faculty would receive
earlier notice if their contract was
not to be renewed.

The procedures had been
approved by the Faculty Assembly
with only one dissenting vote at their
meeting last week.

Under the new procedures, full-
time non-tenure-stream faculty who
have served at least five full years
will be given written notice when
their contract is not renewed at least
five and one-half months prior to
their date of termination.

The present policy, which requires
three and one-half mon_t_l_1s’ notice
“seemed inadequate” for appeals,
said Senate Tenure and Academic

Freedom Co-Chairman Donald
McBurney'. ,

The new procedures also give two
grounds for appeal ofa decision not
to renew the contract of a non-
tenure-stream faculty: “violation of
academic freedom or discrimina-
tion, or inadequate consideration”
for renewal. ’

The new procedures also outline
the process for appealing a non-
renewal decision and give non-
tenure-stream faculty the right to
request the reason for their non-
renewal in writing.

The policies apply only to full-
time faculty because the nature of
part-time work often requires
faculty filling in where there are no
full-time faculty members to take
the positions.

Center in Pittsburgh and provides
pre-recorded information about a
variety of topics over the phone.
Callers ask for the number of the
tape they wish to hear. The tapes last
from one to five minutes.

Tel-Aid is the general name for a
service that includes Tel-Med, Tel-
Law and Tell-A-Kid.‘ Tel-Aid pro-
vides information on areas ranging
from stress, first aid and pregnancy
to consumer information, legal con-
tracts and automobile information.

Tammy Sullenberger of Tel-Aid
said that Tel-Aid. is not supposed to
take the place of a physician or other
professional. “Tel-Aid is a stepping
stone to further help.”

The line is staffed by volunteers
who work at Tel-Aid switchboards

The cutting edge of medical tech-
nolog omes to town in the form of
the ' sburgh Nuclear Magnetic
Resonance Institute now under con-
struction at the corner of Craft and
Fifth Avenues in Oakland.

Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
(NMR) is not radioactive." It is an
incredibly powerful magnet coupled
with a computer in order to produce
images that allow a physician to
“see" into the body ofa patient with
a clarity viously im sible.

“It’s u~
Suszkowski, chairman of the board
at the Pittsburgh NMR Institute. “It
looks like a pen-and-ink medical
drawing ...” _(in contrast to the shad-
owy images of an X-ray).

“The information that magnetic
resonance gives us is totallydifferent
from that obtained from ultrasound,
X-ray or CT scan,” said Dr. Gerald
Wolf, the newly ointed president
of the institute. said that the pic-
tures produced are more diagnostic
because they contain more informa-
tion than the other methods of
imaging.

The patient is inserted into the
center of a huge and werful
magnet, whichis super-co d with
liquid nitrogen to oduce a field
‘strength of 1.5 Te (25,000 times
more powerful than the earth’s mag-
netic field). The magnet causes the

Not only is this picture clearer and
more detailed than X-ray or other
methods, but it entails no risk what-
soever to the patient. -

“Most people don’t realize th
radio waves are all around us,”
explained Dr. Wolf. “All of us have
radio waves passing through us all

The institute is designed to keep
the multitude of radio waves out,

i , The debate continues

Sunday night’s political debate in Louisville between
Walter Mondale and President Reagan was scarcely over
when the second debate had already begun — this one not
limited to candidates but open to every professional and
amateur political observer in the country. The presiden-
tial debate lasted 90 minutes; the debate that currently
obsesses campaign advisers and media commentators is

likely to continue until Nov. 6.

Nearly everyone but the staunchest Reagan backers V
will concede that Mondale scored a victory Sunday night.
What the networks and campaign consultants have been
relentlessly asking since then has been whether his perfor-
mance was strong enough to cut into Reagan’s formida-

ble lead in the polls.

For many, this election has been shaping up not as a
choice between party platforms but as a grudging accept-
ance of the lesser of two evils. There exists a block of
voters who would sooner vote for Mickey Mouse than for

' four more years of Ronald Reagan. These voters usually
vote Democratic, though, so the Republican camp has
virtually written off those votes — an option afforded to
them by their comfortable lead in the polls. There is also a
substantial number of voters, consisting mainly of yup-
pies, who traditionally vote Democratic but have jumped
ship this year due to their party’s failure to come up with a
more viable candidate than Mondale. It is this segment of
voters that is of crucial importance to the Mondale cam-
paign. His ability to woo these voters backto the Demo-
cratic camp may spell the margin of victory and defeat in

several key states in the Northeast —_ a region he must

virtually sweep if he hopes to win the election.

Despite Reagan’s reputation as “the great communica-
tor,” it is notsurprising that Mondale won the debate; he
knew that he had next to nothing to lose and everything
to gain, and an incumbent president makes a big target,

with or without billion-dollar deficits and Medicare cuts.

What was surprising was that he won not only on content

but also on style, which was of equal importance; in 1980,

incumbent Jimmy Carter bested Reagan factually in their

debates, but Reagan came across as smoother and more

in control.

‘ But how important was Mondale’s win? It was crucial
' ' to the Mondale campaign — the race would have been all
but over had he lost — but in reality, it was not enough.
Polls indicate that Mondale did gain ground on Reagan,
but not nearly enough to close the gap, and even if it had
been enough, the election was not held on Monday; the

Reagan camp has nearly four weeks to recover from its .

wounds. ‘

‘Nonetheless, the victory did breathe some new life into
the Mondale campaign, and now that he has the momen-
tum, he must come out charging if he hopes to build on
his modest gains. On Thursday night, Vice President

Bush will meet Geraldine Ferraro in the second debate

Democratic advisers have said that they believed this to

be a stronger card for them than Mondale vs. Reagan

Had Mondale lost the debate on Sunday, this would have
been a moot issue, with little more at stake than the
personal political futures of the two participants. But
, now the task is upon Ferraro and the Democrats to prove

that Sunday was nofluke and their ticket is an aggressive

9

plausible alternative to Reagan’s reelection. Now is not

the time for the Democrats to rest on their laurels or .
' overrate the importance of Mondale’s victory in the first _ ‘

A mainstreamer’s view  

"I/Vhile one who sings with his
tongue on fire/ Gargles -in the rat
race choir/ Bent out ‘of shape by
societyis pliers/ Cares not to come
up any higher/ But rather gets you
down in the hole that he’s in"

—— Bob Dylan
Ma (I’m Only
Bleeding)”

“It's Alright,

It would seem from the views and
reviews of the “underground cul-
ture" in Oakland that the only cure
to what some see as Pittsburgh's
overwhelming mainstream boredom
is to go underground. This obsessive
need, for all things underground,
avante-garde, experimental, etc.,

often shows little discretion and per- '

sonal imagination. A person can
drown Just as easily in a mainstream
as a New Wave. Not to be ﬂooded by

either but to float through and past '

both can be most beneﬁcialto a per-

son. Individual interpretation of‘

both is necessary.’

Since experimental people would
call mainstreamers culturally coma-
tose, perhaps a good name for them
would be “cultural spastics.” The
worst notion the “cultural spastics”
hold is that, somehow, participation»
in the underground is the same as
contribution to it. Creativity by
association. Avante-garde hero wor-
ship is enslavement. Things are in a
bad way when the hip “out” scene

- has more in common with herds of

sheep than so_many loosely like-
minded individuals. 1

_ The underground followers come
in countless forms. Some ofthe most
popular are professionals, unem-

ployed, old and new hippies, those
sheep-like, lamb-brained fashion
mannequins, the Pittsburgh punks
and other similar middle class mis-
ﬁts who make up a large piece of the
cow pasture of Oakland bohemia.
Two perversely appreciated atti-
tudes can be found among some
“cultural spastics.” One is the per-
petually ‘hip/bored‘ indifferent
attitude which is to show a mind
“too busy to bother," but usually
reveals a boring person who thinks
like moss grows. The other is the
attitude conveyed by the person who
always delivers speedy or choppy,

confused speeches as if to show a"

mind “overflowing with,ideas.” Usu-
ally, it shows a confused person who
thinks like trains collide. Neither has
much of worth to say without articu-
lated statements.

The way they can get around this
is to imitate the ideal among them:
to have lived like Baudilier and Rim-
baud with the intellect of Eliot, the
creative output of Picasso and the
apparent forceful iconoclasm of
Nietzsche. -

Somewhere along the under-
ground line, substitutions
accepted for the above people. Since

no one can live like Baudilier and

Rimbaud in Oakland, you create
your own romantic misfortune by
dressing Salvation ‘Army out of cho-
ice rather than necessity and pretend
to be an anarchist caught in a social
commune. And since Eliot's intellect
is not acquirable in the short time

ist film by Jean-Luc Godard~or this

I read with interest both Adam
Eisenstat’s column (“Mr. God Goes
to Washington" in the Oct. 3 issue)
and Mickey Wilson’s response
(“Column lacks logic” in the Oct. 8
issue).

Morality/religion/law has been
the surprise topic of the campaign;
who would ever have thought that
Reagan and Mondale would be
expressing their personal views on
religion on national TV?

Both Eisenstat and Wilson touch
on what I see to be the main issue —'
but that is all. Neither one gets to the
heart of the matter. -

What role does and should reli-
gion play in governing this country?
Should a statesman — whether he be
a president or a mayor — let reli-
gious beliefs sway his decisions?

Eisenstat gets too caught up with
utilitarianism and Jerry Falwell and
fanaticism to give the matter the
treatment it warrants. Wilson has

the right idea (“Was the U.S. then as -
‘highly secular’ as it is now? No, of

course not — so those laws probably
represent a great deal of religious
and moral thinking”) but fails to
follow up with an opinion as to
whether a statesman should allow
religion to sway him.

Obviously, thisiis not an easy:
thing to form an opinion on. One ;:-:-:

If 95 percent of the country is
opposed to desegregation, shouldn’t
those representing that 95 percent
vote as they would have them? Or, if
75 percent ofthe country is opposed
to setting animportquota,shouldn't
those representing them vote against
it? I think that Gerry Ferraro would
be perfectly within her rights if she
could honestly say that the district
she represents (Queens) is opposed
to abortion so she will vote against
It.

_Second of all, there is the record
of history. An often-chosen but
extreme argument for an anti-
abortion law is that of “look at the
Nazi persecution of the Jews. That
was a case where religion should
have swayedstatesmen.” But at the
same time, should anyonejust stand

first, this seems to be a simplistic
argument, but if you look at capital
punishment, isn’t that a case of a
majority deciding that it is just fine
for the government to execute
criminals?

True, these arguments are a little
extreme, too, but isn’t the basicjist
applicable? I

I agree with Wilson —— abortion,
capital punishment and the like are
too difficult to judge, too “close to
the heart” for the quick ’n’easy deci-
sion to be made. But I don’t think
that statesmen think in terms of a
urilitarianistic view —~ it just
happens that utilitarianism and their
sense of “right and wrong” coincide.

Krishnas
seek  
temple

By Carrie Stetler
The Pitt News

Last week, a man and woman in
mid-eastern dress sat at a table
covered with booklets outside the
Cathedral. Their names are Brehots-
loka Das and Sravna Devi Dasi, and
they were at Pitt trying to get stu-
dents interested in helping them
establish a Hare Krishna temple in
Oakland.

Das and Dasi are a married cou-
ple who arrived from India justa
month\ago. They want’ to set up a
temple that will bevaccessible to stu-
dents. “There was a temple on
Forbes Avenue a while ago, but‘
when it moved to Negley Avenue a
lot of students -couldn’t come
because it was too far away,” Das
said. -

The Hare Krishnas are a, religious
cult whose beliefs are similar to
those of orthodox Hinduism. They
have been the object of numerous
controversies since the group estab-
lished itself in the U.S. 15 years ago.

The couple is also seeking an
activities charter from the univer-
sity. They hope to begin a vegetarian
cooking class here at Pitt. “We
wouldn't be talking about anything
but cooking in the class,” Das said.
“People need to be trained if they
want to become vegetarians. A lot of
people want to, but they don't know
how.” ‘

Das and Dasi distrubuted
Krishna Conciousness literature
while on campus and spoke with
interested students. They have now
moved to the student union of
Carnegie-Mellon University
because the weather is getting
cooler." They are not allowed to dis-
tribute their pamphlets in Pitt
buildings. Q

Although Krishna conciousness
has always been practiced in India to
a greater or lesser degree, it didn’t
arrive in the U.S. until the mid-60s
when Bhaktivedanta Swami Prab-
hupada emigrated from India to
Manhattan. -

When he arrived in the U.S., he
was a 70-year old man with only $7
in his pocket and no associates in
this country. He managed to find a
small room in the Bowery and began
attracting a following of hippies who

‘ had taken an interest in mid—eastern

mysticism. As the religion gained
momentum and more people fol-
lowed the elderly guru, the original

members, who had little knowledge ,

of their new religion, progressed
from wearing love beads and chant-
ing the mantra to the practice ofvar-
ious complex rituals and the
devotional study of vedic scripture.

Early devotees report being
impressed by Prabhupada’s spiritual
purity and- enormous personal
magnetism.

‘Although he died in 1977, Prab-
hupada’s picture and transcripts of
his sermons appear constantly in
Krishna magazines. Because he was
the founder of the movement in the
U.S. (and consequently responsible
for it’s revivalism in India) theologi-
ans are amazed at his success in
establishing V a completely foreign
religion in the U.S. -It has grown
from a non-sectarian cult status to a
near institution. A

Although Prabhupada is an
immensely important ﬁgure in the

‘Krishna movement, he differs from

egocentric leaders such as the Reve-
rrend Moon, who reportedly distance
themselves from their following and
live in wealth and splendor while
misguided devotees beg in the
streets. Prabhupada appears to have
been an inspirational figure who
kept in close contact with his follow-
ers and wrote 8,000 letters to them
before his death. A ‘

danger, they would have to be inside
the building. That is unlikely,
according to Dr. Wolf. The building
is shielded, and “the inside is a con-
trolled environment,” he said.

“The only worrisome thing is that
it mighfeiase the magnetic stripe on
the back of your credit card or stop
your watch."

The bad news is the expense. Wolf
estimated that the average cost of an

-exam will be $700. If twice the

number of exams could be done in

the same amount of time, the cost’

could be reduced 40 percent.

No matter what the cost, the
NMR machine will prove to be a
boon for cancer patients, Wolf said.
By performing what is called a tissue
spectroscopy, the physician will be
able to see where healthy tissue ends
and a tumor begins. ,

“We can perform a biopsy with-
out invading the. body," said Susz-
kowski. This will be of special
significance to those suffering from
brain tumors. A surgeon will be able
to operate with a minimum of.dam-
age to the healthy tissue surrounding
the tumor. It will also reduce the risk
of repeated exposure to harmful X-
rays —— NMR is harmless.

Researchers elsewhere have
announced some astounding results
in the area of research. In Great Bri-
tain, they were able to ﬁnd vascular
brain problems in the fetuses of
women with high-risk pregnancies.
Stanford researchers were able to
measure the cardiac plaque buildup
(hardening of the heart arteries and
a major cause of heart attack) in

heart patients without cardiac

cathcterization. ‘

The first magnet should arrive
later this month. Allowing time for
installation, the first subject should
be scanned by late January. A
second and ‘even more powerful
magnet (2.1 Tesla) should arrive in
July. The stronger the magnet, the

better the resolution ‘and detail of V

the picture become. It will be the
most powerful magnet in the U.S.
used for clinical NMR imaging.

But the diagnostic clinic at Craft
and Fifth is only one part of the
institute. They are also investing
heavily in an NMR research facility
to be jointly operated by the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh and Carnegie-
Mellon University at Mellon
Institute. - .

These universities have been lead-
ers in NMR research for some time.
The new, facility ‘should establish
Pittsburgh as the undisputed leader
in NMR research and technology.

“The field is ripe for break-
throughs,” said Robert Sekerka,
dean of the ‘Mellon College of
Science and the head of the research
arm of the institute. “Eventually,
good things are going to happen."

Those good things will be the
study of the effect’ of chemotherapy
on cancer tissue. Theyhope to prove
that smaller doses are better than
massive doses and‘ to eventually
reduce «the exposure of cancer
patients to harmful radiation.

They hope, through the expected
breakthroughs in computer memory
and storage, to produce a three-
dimensional hologram of the
patient. The surgeon would then be

‘ able to choose the best location for

the incision and literally “map” his
way to a tumor before operating.

Not only is the institute creating
technological innovations, but the
group itself is something of an inno-
vation. It is one of the first large
health care consortiums in the
world. Twelve hospitals and two
major universities have joined
together to finance and beneﬁt from
the facility and its research.

“We believe it to be the largest
consortium in the world for NMR,”
said the institute’s public relations
director, Michele Baer. “Rising
costs have forced the alliance, and it
should mark the beginning of a
trend in health care.” Experts
applaud the setup. '

ful in cutting costs that the Hospital

ing to Das, the Krishnas use these

_ donations to print more distributive

literature about their religion. Some
of the money goes to support full-

Dasi who say that since Hare Krish-
nas are not after material wealth,
they only buy what they need. Also,
the movement’s growing lay mem-
bership (followers who pursue ca-

instead of becoming missionaries)
donate up to 50 percent of their
income so that school systems, tem-
ples and public service programs can

Today there are more than l0,000
Hare Krishnas world-wide. Over
5,000 practice in the U.S., and of

Krishna devotees abstain from
meat-eating, intoxication, gambling
and illicit sex. They devote them-
selves to the worship of Krishna, a
Hindu deity usually incarnate in the
form of a.“blue-limbed adolescent
boy.” Although Krishna manifests a
different form than the christian

. God, Hare Krishnas believe that all-

supreme, creator deities are the
same. According to the Krishnas,
“God is one.”

Since Krishna consciousness‘ is
essentially an orthodox form of Hin-
duism,_the Hare Krishnas believe in
the reincarnation of the soul and
strive to free their lives from aicycle
of death and re-birth in the material
world. “Krishna conscious” means a
constant a_warg_1_ess of God.

The youth had everything: intelli-

i answers to everyone‘s problems.
« Suddenly, he was faced with a major

problem: his parents were getting
divorced. He ‘could not accept the

situation, and he saw no other alter-

native but suicide. A .

This personal tragedy was por-
trayed in “Stepping Into Tomor-
row,” a theatrical production
presented at the Student Union
Monday night by the group
Nucleus. ‘

The production, sponsored by the
Black Action Society, stressed the

_ message of positive energy through

included skits dealing with the many

problems that youths encounter. .

Central America (UPI) — El Sal-
vador’s leftist rebels agreed yester-
day to President Duarte’s proposal
for a face-to-face meeting in
guerrilla-controlled territory  with
a few conditions. In a statement
broadcast by their clandestine radio,
the rebels said they will meet Duarte
“in the date and the place proposed.”
But they called for Duarte to bring
with him leaders of the Salvadoran
military, as well as Columbia’s presi-
dent, to act as an intermediary dur-
ing the talks. Duarte extended his
surprise offer in a speech yesterday
to the U.N. General Assembly. He
proposed to attend the meeting
accompanied only by journalists
and representatives of the Roman
Catholic Church. The rebels’ accep-
tance was surprisingly swift, but not

‘without conditions. Therebels want

Columbian President Betanchur
and representatives of the Salvador-

. an army high command to be there.

       
     
     
       
     

They offered to send four represen-
tatives —— two each from the military
and political wings of ‘the revolu-
tionary movement. In addition, the
rebel leadership proposes that
troops from bothsides agree to keep
their distance — 10 kilometers, or
about six miles — from the town of
La Palma, where the meeting is to
take place. So far, no comment from
Salvadoran military sources about
the rebels’ conditions.

The first three matches were the
easiest — they were all forfeits — but
when it came time to play thereal
matches,- the Pitt women's tennis
team had little difﬁculty in defeating
St. Vincent, 9 matches to 0.

Pitt swept the six matches that
were played, netting their first shut-
out of the year and boosting their
season record to an impressive 8-3.

Head coach George Dieffenbach
viewed the match as a perfect oppor-
tunity to sharpen his team for the
upcoming Big East championships.
“Well, this wasn’t the most difficult

match we’ve had this year,” said

Dieffenbach‘ in a statement compar-
able to calling a hurricane “just a

that¢St. Vincent was unable to gain
even'a single set and won only atotal

.. of 15 games in all the singles matches

Dieffenbach couldn't help look-
ing to the tournament looming two
weeks ahead. “It was agood day for
us to practice some shots and get
ready for the Big East.”

No.1 player Jodi Levine set the
day’s pattern early, easily disposing
of Maria Bolkavac 6-1, 6-2. That
opening victory was quickly fol-

Pitt only has partial scholar-

take on SCH

The Pitt News

The horror show is over, or is it
merely intermission?

Masquerading as a directionless"

cast that instilled despair in its
audiences during September, .the
Pitt football team ﬁnally turned it
around with a win against East
Carolina last Saturday. Yes, there
were some (though they were hard to
ﬁnd) who knew‘ that the losing
would end sometime. The elation
might be cut short for the Panthers
who now embark on a road stopping
in South Carolina and Miami.

No doubt the direction will be evi-
dent against the Gamecocks this
weekend or the Hurricanes the Sat-
urday after, but .despair might still
counteract the chemotherapy of a
Carolina or U.M. team.

“The squad was very elated after
the victory [Saturday]," head coach
Foge Fazio said yesterday. “We've
been on the other side of the ledger
all season long.”

The Panthers might beright back
there after ﬁghting Columbia

Numbers reveal “infamous” question

By Jim Brueckner
The Pitt News

If you find yourself searching for
answers to the infamous question,
“Why did the Panthers win on Sat-
urday?" ponder this and other inter-
esting statistics. Craig “lronhead“
Heyward stands six feet tall and
weighs 235 lbs. The East Carolina
defensive line averages 230 lbs. Usu-
ally it is the other way around. Also
the defensive line usually outweighs
the running back by as much as 40-
50 lbs. When Pitt assistant coach
Charles “Yogi” Jones said, “The
thing that makes their defense work

[East Carolina's] is that they have
good team speed. The slowest speed
at every position is probably 4.8.
East Carolina seems to sacrifice size
for speed," he was not kidding.
During Pitt’s opening two drives
they averaged l.7 yards per play on
first down. But when Heyward was
inserted into the game, his size took
over. Inspired by the aggressive run-
ning of Heyward, the Panther
offense averaged 9.7 yards per play
on first down over the next two
drives. Not coincidentally, those

drives resulted in touchdowns.
Coming into the ECU game, the

Pitt running backs other than Glad-

man and Heyward were averaging a

lowly 2.8 yards per carry. ln Satur-
day’s game, they didn't set the house
on fire, but their 3.3 yard average
was a much needed improvement.

Facts 8
Figures

One thing that this improved run-
ning game did was to give the Panth-
ers the winning edge in the time of
possession battle. 33:21-26:39. In the

second half, the Panther offense had
the ball four times and managed to
hold onto if for periods of4:l l, 5: l2,
3:46 and 3:25. On the defensive side,
ECU’s two longest drives (by time of
possession) both came in the second
half. Those drives (5:45 and 5:24)
were the longest drives by either
team, yet the Panther defense tough-
ened up and allowed only three
points between those two drives.
Another area that benefited by the
rushing attack was the old “ball-
room blitz” or the lack thereof.
Unlike the last game, when the
offense went through 12 consecutive
routines of l-2-3 kick, against East
Carolina the offense never had to

Previously this year, the Panthers
have suffered greatly in the fourth
quarter. They were outscored 52-0
coming into Saturday’s game.
Although they were still outscored
in the final quarter against ECU 7-3,
they finally managed to show some
offense late in the game when it
counted most. Over the entire game,
the field position came out dead
even. However, after East Carolina
scored their lone touchdown of the
game to make the score 17-10, the
Pitt offense could not afford to give
up good field position. What they
did was drive 53 yards in the fourth
quarter to pin East Carolina deep in
their own territory. Until this game
the offense usually disappeared at
this time.

In the first four games, Bill Wal-
lace supplied most of the passing
attack from the receiving side.
Through the first four games, Wal-

lace caught 21 of the«57 completed -

passes (37 percent). In Saturday’s
game he improved that percentage
by catching five more passes of the
l3. Wallace has produced an even
higher percentage of the yardage. By
gaining 364 ofthe team’s 823 passing
yards, he single-handedly accounted
for 44 percent ofthe Panther passing
attack.

Finally, on seven of Pitt’s nine
possessions, Pitt broke into East
Carolina territory. Considering that
in one of the two drives in which they
did not, they were stopped at the 50,
it is evident that the Panther offense
is reaching the heights that were
expected of it. .

Here’s a surprise: While everyone
is well aware that former Pitt quar-
terback Dan Marino is having a
good year, some may not realizejust
how good. At his present rate
Marino will pass for over 4500 yards
and an incredible 45 touchdowns.

player who gets herself up for all
the matches. Sally's real coacha-
ble and has been one of the most
coachable players I’ve had,” Col-
lier said. “She knows we can’t

Game digs: The Spikers were

His passing may only be just
below the 50 percent mark, but it’s
an improvement over a previous
entrenchment in the lower 405.

‘‘At this point, [Congemi] is prob-
ably as healthy as he’s been at the
start of the season,” quarterback
coach Ron Turner disclosed. “His
mind is off the injury, and he’s felt a
lot more sure of himself and what
the team can do. Hopefully, that will
carry over to this game.” .

If anything, this game remind
one of last year’s opener against

. Tennessee. Before nearly 96,000
screaming fanatics in Dixieland’s
largest stadium, Neyland Field, the
Panthers weren’t as burdened by fan
noise as expected. Well, this year’s
Tennessee experience moves’ to

* Columbia, where football is as
highly idolized as the Ayatollah is in
Iran. :

The answer? “We'll have speakers
on the practice ﬁeld,” Turner said
unﬂinchingly. ‘‘We’ll get that atmos-
phere going so that when it happens,
the guys won't panic, they’ll be
ready. We’ll go with hand signals if
we have to.” _

No one need understand sema-
phore to realize the wolves’ den the
Panthers will enter on Saturday.
Williams-Brice will be host to the
Gamecocks’ ﬁfth straight home
game.

“You’re the 4-0 team getting ready
to play a team that is 1-4,” Fazio
said, describing the scenario. “You
ought to be licking your chops.”

It’s a plot that’s been acted out too

- many times already —. the Panthers
playing the part of the sacriﬁcial
lamb.

loose ends offensively, Fazio
retracted any earlier thoughts of

Both tight end Tom Johnson and
offensive guard Greg Christy will
likely be sidelined for the rest of the
season after undergoing - arthro-
scopic knee surgery later this week.

Junior Barry Pettyjohn will con-
tinue to ﬁll in for Christy on the left
side. Taking his place at center will

Depending on freshman Dante
W1ley’s progress during practice up
to the South Carolina game, Fazio is
still unsure whether he will start him

start against ECU but suffered a

Every other self-respecting sports .

writer in the nation is talking about

"-the World Series, so, I guess I might

as well join them.

According to all the know-it-all
real journalist types, this year will
provide a boring series that Detroit

. » will win hands down. But World

Series games are rarely played by
pencil-pushing reporters who have
all the right answers after the game is
over.

After reading my 17th column on
how the Tigers beat the San Diego
Padres on paper, I started to wonder
how you play baseball on paper.
Calculators and slide rules are great
for trying to get an idea who may
win and to get your bet down, but
they can't take one thing into consid-
eration. Heart.

' Although it sounds very unscien-
tific, one thing that plays a major

role in every championship is heart.

You know what heart is. It’s that
little bit extra that a player finds to
run a step faster, reach a little higher
and,throw a little harder. It is also a
feeling that a group of players have
when they become a team, no longer
individuals working for a paycheck.

Every championship that I can
remember has had just a little some-

nsiegop

1--

thing extra, something special.
Heart is something that is a prob-
lem for journalists. You can't mea-
sure heart and put it on the screen
while the guy is batting. People try
to get a handle on it by measuring a
players ability to! perform in the
clutch, by how many game winning
runs he scored and things like that.
But it doesn’t reflect what heart is. It
can only be understood by example.
One of the best examples of heart
may have been a team from this city
not very long ago. The 1979 Pitts-
burgh Pirates were a team which at
the beginning of the season most
people thought had little more than
heart. But to everyone’s surprise,
except their own, they battled back
to win the division. After beating
Cincinnati in three straight, the
Pirates moved on to the World Ser-
ies where, much like the Padres this
season, they were to be quickly
removed by the Orioles, who had
them thoroughly thrashed on paper.
It looked like those games played
on paper would hold up as the Ori-
oles took three of the first four
games from the Pirates. But then
something happened and those
games, as far as the Orioles were
concerned, should have been fin-
ished on paper. '
While sports writers dug around
for reasons why their predictions

had missed the mark, the Pirates »

were celebrating one of the best
come-from-behind victories in
World Series history. That team had
heart. ,

San Diego has heart too. They
battled back when everyone had
counted them out to beat the Chi-
cago Cubs for the right to meet the
mighty_Tigers in the Fall classic.

So after the commentators add up
all the numbers and tell you who is
going to win, before they start play-
ing, remember one thing. The games

Moore
ldeas

will be played and that little white
ball has been known to take some
awfully strange bounces and no mat-
ter how much they like to think
they’re important, sportswriters and
all their games on paper will have
nothing to do with who wins or
loses. Heart will.

0 Now, a few other things about
the series.

This year the series will take on a
different‘ look as the Tigers will be
able to use their normal pitching
rotation while the Padres will be off

I 'l‘Ihei'Pitt News,» Wednesday, October 10', 1984

one beat.

The Tigers No. l and No. 2
pitchers, Jack Morris and Dan
Petry, will open the Series while the
Padres will not get to use their ace
Eric Show until game three at the
earliest since he pitched the deciding
game against the Cubs on Sunday.

Although this may look bad for
the Padres, it may be just the oppo-
site. In the two games he pitched
against the Cubs, Show never made
it to the fourth inning and in five and
two-thirds innings gave up eight
hits, five of which were home runs.
And he's their ace.

0 The managers of the teams are
no stranger to the World Series or
each other. Sparky Anderson of the
Tigers and Dick Williams of the
Padres, who played together with
Tommy Lasorda years ago for the
Los Angeles Dodgers, have man-
aged against each other in the World
Series before. Williams, then with
the Oakland A’s, defeated the Cin-
cinnati Reds piloted by Anderson in
1972 in seven-games.

Anderson admits Williams out-
managed him in that series but is
intent on not making the same mis-
take twice.

Williams, on the other hand,
enjoyed the first meeting and would
like to see history repeat itself.

The Panthers next two oppo-'

Nobody said it was going to be
easy, but Pitt should be proud of one
thing. They have been beat by some
of the best talent in the nation.

ager Harding “Pete" Peterson has

tive by Sports Illustrated Magazine.

0 From San Francisco comes the
story that Edward De Bartolo Jr. is

‘ interested in buying the San Francis-

co Giants. If everything works out,
the Giants would be the fifth profes-
sional sports franchise owned by the
De Bartolo family. Junior owns the
San Francisco 49ers football team
while his dad owns the Pittsburgh
Maulers of the USFL, the Pitts-
burgh Spirit of the MISL and the

Pittsburgh Penguins of the NHL.

Some people collect stamps and oth-
ers collect ball teams.

One does have to wonder about
buying the Giants. You would think
that the Maulers and the Penguins
would be enough losers for any one
person to handle.

0 And finally, a small and proba-
bly unprofessional response to one
R. Hunter Caffee (I wish I had three
names like that) who resides down
the street at neighboring Carnegie
Mellon University. Mr. Caffee was
so concerned with the state of affairs
here at Pitt he took the time to write
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. In his
letter,published in Tuesday's edi-
tion, Caffee stated, “Wouldn't it be
wonderful if the majority of Pitt
football and basketball players
knew how to speak basic English?”

Mr. Caffee, let-me ask you this.
How many members of the Pitt foot-
ball and basketball teams have you
spoken with lately? My guess is there
are around a hundred or so football
players and I2 basketball players, so
you have talked to about sixty of
them at least. Busy boy.

I. would like to thank you for I
pointing out that we are an athleti-

‘ Cally great university and also men-

tioning academic achievements
here, in particular the polio vaccine
by Jonas Salk. And as to your invi-
tation to go to CMU to see a ball-
game — the whole game —~ thanks
but no thanks. I have everything I
need right here at Pitt. ‘

competition made it -tough for
Gibbs, who on Friday played what
she called “the best match of my
life.” However,Gibbs would not
admit to feeling let down after Fri-
day’s emotional roller-coaster
match. “It wasn’t that hard to get
ﬁred up for it. I was able to go to the
net more because of the shots she
was giving me, and I was able to
practice some shots.”

In defense-of St.-Vincent, how-,

ever, it must be remembered that its

them to field a women’s tennis team.

forced to forfeit two singles matches
and one doubles match due to an
illness that is plaguing the club. Yes-

terday, they brought only four play- A

ers, compared with the eight players
who dressed for Pitt.

In the fourth match, Julie Gress
won again: this time in a straight set
victory over Nancy Berkhardt.
Gress did not mince words when
commenting on her win: “When you
play _a backboard like I did today, it
gets very frustrating. All she hit back
were lobs so I could return only
smashes. I spent more time chasing
after the ball than I did on the
court.” In the final singles match,
Jenny Leach eased her way to a 6-1.,

with the way I played, but I still need
to work on my serve."

The only difference when it came
to doubles play was that there were
two players on each side of the net.

Panthers
to   host
Penguins

By Kirsten Gostony
’ The Pitt News

Tonight's match between the
Pitt soccer team (4-3-l) and
Youngstown State’s Penguins (2-
!) promises soccer fans an even-
ing of intense excitement.
Despite last year‘s overwhelm-
ing 7-Ovictory over their upcom-
‘ ing opponent, head coach
Lu-xbacher anticipates a tough
game. “Although we defeated
them rather decisively last year,
they’re a better team this year,
offering us a greater challenge."
To compound the situation,
there's “no denying that the
Panthers have had trouble scor-
ing during the season thus far.
“We're really hoping to break the
ice as far as scoring is con-
cerned,” explained tri-captain
Dave Torrence, “and now’s as
good a time as any to do so."

“There’s no real excuse for us
not having scored well this year.
Although we are basically a
young team, we do have players
with the ability to score,” stated
Luxbacher. “It's important to
remember that it’s a team effort
to score. The forwards need to be
fed a good pass before they can
consider a shot. lt’sjust a matter
of keeping our composure,
retaining our concentration and
playing well as a team.”
_ The game is scheduled to begin
at 7:15 p.m. under the lights at
the Pitt stadium. F

The Pitt-West Virginia match
on Saturday, Oct. 13, is Pitt
Youth Soccer Day. All members
of youthand high school soccer
teams will be admitted free of

or jerseys and registering at

that come with responsible drinking. V

They know the responsibility they take on when they drir. talsohol beverages or serve these
beverages to others...a responsibility for safety, health and proper conduct.

And they knowithe best way to practice that responsibility is through moderation.
By knowing their limits, and sticking to them. I -

’ By neither accepting, noroffering “one-for-the—road.",
By neither condoning nor contributing to irresponsible behavior.
And by exhibiting at all times, a responsible attitude about alcohol.
They know the special responsibility that comes with the decision to drink alcohol...moderation.
That's -the only way to drink...responsibly. ‘
