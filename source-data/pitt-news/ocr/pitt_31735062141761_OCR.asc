stated‘ that’there is no advantage" in
submittiiig playsmbefore December 15,
and has consequently ‘urged contest-
ants to hold their manuscripts until
that time to enable them. to revise
and improve their ‘copies. -

Of the two plays submitted,_it was
necessary to. return one because?‘ the
authors had failed to observe ' the

‘- Duringtlie week of-‘December 11
the women’s section of the depart-
ment of Physical Education ‘is plan-
ning to give to every woman enrolled
in -its department a motor-ability test.
In this test,
eight exercises, designed to show her
endurance, speed, strength, co-ordina_-
"tion, _balance,_" co_ntrol,,agility, skill,

- courage and .ti"me-reaction.

Heretofore this section. has given
medical ‘and anthropometric. tests. By
this new plan of incl1'iding'motor.iabi_l-_,

ity tests along with the medical and"

anthropon1e"t1'ic tests, it is hoped’ that
physical ability may. be ‘measured in
‘the same way that mental ability is
now measured by psychological tests.‘,
This plan was devised by Miss Agnes
R.» Way;nan, head of the Physical Ed-
ucation department of Barnard Col-
lege,‘ Columbia University and was
adopted at the annual meeting of the
Eastern Association of Directors of
Physical Education _in women’s col-
leges, held at Bryn Mawr last April.
Freshmen of -twenty-four colleges will
endeavor to set ‘a standard’ for physi-
cal eﬁiciency by which stu_den,t§,-_""all
over the country may betested. "From
a. study’ ‘of therecords made this year
in ‘thé‘§‘lhun_dreds pf teStS"i&'IliCh are
being given, the authorities can deter-
mine a normal‘ scores and succeeding
students ‘when tested "can",-.then‘ be
ph_y§_ica*1ly.t:las"siﬁed.'. ‘ _" ‘
Great int"erest_'>: has already "been
shown by"-*the_‘..students where the

DEAR MA AND POP

VVell folkswe won the game on

we went down to -the big hotel, it is

people there from all over the U. S’.
They have great ‘big chairs and sofas
where you can sit .free of charge and
seeboys ,witli -mai'lman’s suits on
running around calling out people’s
names.  .

WE went way‘ up on the. seven-
teenth ﬂoor and got into the dance
ﬂoor and there was certainly some
crowd -there. If they call the stuff
we did dancing then a watch ticking
would be a curfew for there wasn’t
‘hardly any movement allowed for
fear "you would get somebody’s elbow
where only your collar should. be or
somebody thought that your feet had
welcome -written -all over them the
way they cleaned of their shoes on
them. Anyhow we had a darn good
time. ‘Today they divided our Eng-
lish class into, the good ones and the
poor ones and I was put in the poor
class" and I says. tothe proffesor why
did he put me in that class and
he says so that the others‘ would
have someone to copy after in do-
ing good work as he -would ‘never
think of putting .me in it for any
‘other reason. I says I thought that
was the reason because I did not
belong to that class and he says
that I was right but those were the
only two divisions and tho I, did'be-
long in a third one he couldn’t make
another. divis_ion just forjme so you
see folks I stand pretty high in his
estimation. ' .

CHARACTER AND ATHLETICS

 

The cultivation of a good character
is and should be the desire of all in-
telligent people. A reputation may
be gained and may -at any time be
lost; ‘but character marks a person’s
inner feelings and does not change
with the sway of public opinion as
does reputation. '

Every act, every thought during
our lives tends toward the moulding
of our character, either one way or
the other. The moulding of a char-
acter (and we refer. to a good one)
is like the healing of a wound. Be-
cause a younger person grows more
rapidly his wounded ﬂesh grows to-
gether more‘ quickly than that of an
older and mature person. So it is
with habits. A,person who isyoung
is more sensitive and will more easily
conitracts habits than «one. who is
older, and it is these habits Which
form our -character and which will
remain-with us through life.- To have
a good character, then, the person
must think of educative topics and
engage in vocations‘ and avocations
that will beneﬁt“him andtend towards
building up a strong character.

Sports play a prominent part in the
upbuilding of good character. Con-
sider the man who is on ‘a. team———a
school team. He knows that he must
forget personal glory, for that willget
him nothing. He knows that he is
playing for the school, not for him-
self, and must put his all into the
game in co-operation with the others
on the team. He, in this way, loses
that much hated egotistic feeling.

He prepares for a game; feeling
conﬁdent but not over-conﬁdent; he
tries with all his power to win. If
victorious, he learns to accept it with-
out.the usual accompanying “swelled
head;” if defeated, he bears no ill
will towards his conquerors. It is
this sportsmanship that builds power-
ful characters. Any form of compe-
tition will produce these" results, but
athletic"'competition stands foremost
in this respect. “Playing hard” and,

of a. strong character. Accepting de-
feat and victory alike is the sign
of great moral strength. "
Education is a necessity, but edu-
cation withoutcharacter will rather
hinder than aid a person in his climb
for success in this world.-——Temple
University, Philadelphia. ‘

 

CONSIDER THE ACHAPERON

The chaperon is a guest and not a
necessary evil, brought about by mod-
ern convention, and therefore it is
the duty of the other guests and the
hosts to see that they are entertained,
especially is it expected ‘at our school
dances. Members of the faculty are
usually asked to act in this capacity,
and often it is only through courtesy
that they accept, because students
show little effort in making the even-
ing pleasant‘ for them‘, consequently
they must decorate the walls or en-
tertain the old folks. Remember that
a chaperon from a college faculty is
not dull and uninteresting; can dance
and enjoy it as much as the under-
graduate. Make, it a pleasure for
them to be there instead of a distaste-
ful duty. .
' ——-The Carnegie Tartan.

 

THE CLASS N. E. c.

 

Some students attend lectures with
but one apparent purpose—to get
notes. To really absorb the subject
matter of the lecturer does not seem
important.to them. Certain of these
students are‘ wont to sink back‘ in
their seats after the lecture has
started and take convenient little
naps. Suddenly they” awaken and
quickly edge over to their nearest
neighbor, and bending over to see
his notes, copy what he has written.

Two evils result from this prac-
tice." First of all, the student depend-
mg on his neighbor for notes is do-
ing himself an injustice. If his hear-
ing is normal he may legitimately be
expected to take down his own notes.
"If he is incapable of concentrating on
the lecture, he should not be in that
lecture course. But more than this,
an injustice is done to the man from
whom he is copying. It is certainly
distracting to have someone constant-
ly leaning over one’s shoulder, copy-
ing notes and asking, an explanation
of them if they are not manifestly
clear.

A student who believes that getting
notes is the primary object of attend-
ing a lecture is sadly misguided.
Notes are a necessity in college
courses but the proper way to get
them is through listening attentively
and not through copying them from
the nearest neighbor's notebook.-
From the Michigan Daily.

 

WHY STUDENTS I’-"Al L

“The standard of work in my class-
es is lower this year than "it has
ever been in the 20 years that I hav-e
been an instructor in this Univer-
sity«, and the amount of work cover-
ed in a half-semester is "less than I
have ever before known it to be,”
says one of our University instruct-

al achievements of the modern col-
lege. student.

ors ‘in commenting on the education- .

As a -primarycause -for this large  
increaseyg in the failure of-_.-students  

:0
their time was wasted in useless
preparation. He denounced some of
his colleagues as contributing to the
disregard of long-established princi-
ples of study.

A second reason for the failure of
students, according ‘to this teacher
is that students spend too much of
their time off the campus, and in
proof of this fact he cited the cases
of‘ two young,‘ men who had failed
because they spent every week-end at
their homes.

A third reason was the fact that
students spend too much time -on,
and take too- much interest in, side
issues of college life, such as dra-
,ma.tics, -Y. M. -C. A. and-Y.‘ W. C. A.,
athletics of all kinds, newspaper
work, debating, playing in orchestras
and other things of secondary impor-
tance. All these things, if carried
on to an excess, are detrimental to
the real educational work of the stu-
dent.

The social life of the student was
given as ._a fourth reason for the
failure of students. No average stu-
dent can dance half the night on
Friday, and Saturday, have a social
engagement on Sunday night and
come to class Monday with lessons
prepared, he asserted.

Movies, thuses, mixes, social en-
gagements and athletics all came un-
der, criticism for their part in di-
verting the student from his real

'P11T‘lJose in college—that of getting
an education.
Another important reason given

was the attitude in which students:
held. their work. According to him,‘

more than half the students regard
their classwork a a matter of second-
ary importance. When the student
has gratiﬁed all of his other desires,
he maysettle down about 12 o’clock
at night to gleam a few grains of
momentary knowledge out of the
textbook in order that he may suc-
cessfully bluff the instructor the fol-
lowing day. ; I _ -.
All these reasons for the failure
of students have been given by this
instructor after much reflection, but
we do not have to take his word for
it that they are correct. We have
our mid-semestergrades before us
and our activities records behind us;
let us calculate for ourselves as to
whether or not this professor is giv-
ing a true explanation.———The Athen-
aeum.

Russell believes that instructors give

ERRORS OF A. _B. SEE
('N. Y. Herald)

Brooklyn, which had not had a lit-
erary shock since-Pat McCarren used
the word “phlebotomy” in his debate
with Tim Woodruff, now staggers un-
der the assault made by A. B. See on
women’s colleges. Mr. See says he
would burn them all if he could. He
does not like the education they give.
He, ‘if he had his way, would educate
girls to quit cigarets and slang, “stop
swaggering, give up their b_old and
brazen manners, their paint and their
powder and their lipsticks and their
high heeled shoes.” He would have
them “cease to dress‘ indecently.”

Mr. See complains that college grad-
uates cannot write a legible hand,
cannot use English properly, cannot
spell. “They have their brains twist-
ed,” he says, “by studying psychology,
logic and philosophy.” He advocates
taking them out of college and putting

- them at hard manual labor for a year.

These slams at’women’s colleges and
their students were forthcoming when
Adelphi College asked Mr. A. B. See,
whose very name suggests education
in the rough, to contribute toward its
new buildings. " g

It is plain that A. B. See does know
a ‘b c about girls, particularly college.
girls. He is reciting a lot of super-
stitions about them like a small boy
who is informing another ‘small boy
that he will catch warts from hand-
ling a toad. When anybody like Mr.
See tells you that girls are bold and
brazen and painted, that their heels
are too high and their heads too hol-
low, put him "down as a joykiller.
Take him out in the sunlight, and
show him a couple of thousand girls.
Brooklyn swarms with them, all beau-
tiful, demure and intelligent.

Mr. See, who builds elevators,
should put a safety clutch on his tem-
per and not let: it slip again into the
cellar of violent exaggeratione—The
New York University Daily.

E OF SPEECH

 

A CYCL

Naturalness of expression is a qual-

ity which is highly appreciated. Every V

cultured person enjoys hearing other
people speak correct grammatical
English, but he likes to hear it spoken
with ease and conﬁdence. '

A curious change comes over the
college man during his four_ years at
college. There is marked improve-
ment in his speech, and his conversa-
tion becomes more natural. He adopts
much college slang and abbreviates
whenever possible. His language
might be called “picturesque.”
certainly not error-proof. '

But when the senior year is reached.
the student speaks most effectively. '

He has lost the ‘artiﬁciality of his.
freshman year.
the inadequacy of the language which
he used during his sophomore year.

Much of the enthusiasm and reckless- " ' ' L

ness of his underclass days has dis-
appeared and his speech reflects his-
new dignity. Unconsciously he speaks
more correctly than he ever did be-
fore.

studies. And best of all, his s-peech.is-
natural, and his conversation is
stamped with self-conﬁdence.

The cycle is interestin, and reveals

a curious change in the attitude of
the student, which comes as a result
of four years of contact with the]
broadening inﬂuences of the univer-
sity.———The Michigan Daily.

A“

"rude awakening,

“result was that when the University

:; .‘ P,

 

on the Panther’s hands ,When she
met the State eleven than there was
when the W. and J. outﬁt was met.
While it was an undeniable fact that
Pitt had a great eleven, an eleven
that will rank with the best in the
east, yet it was just forcibly dem-
onstrated to the Panther and its ad-
herents that the State eleven was
also good, although they did not come
here with the record of the sup-
posedly unbeatable type of spirit
that the VV. and J. team brought
with them to this city. Pitt had a
' and they did not
fully realize the fact that they were
in the game of the season until the
second half of the game had been
started.

- As far as the studei_its‘pa',rt in the
victory over State is concerned, the
less said the better. Pitt fell down
miserably in her second attempt to
work up real college spirit. From
the time that the last whistle in the
W. and J. game blew, and the stu-
dents saw that the game was safely
tucked away, they were content to
sit back with their hands folded and
wait for the State eleven to arrive
for their beating that was (being
scheduled in the minds of all. The

officials made up the schedule for
the ﬁnal assembly before the vaca-
tion,.that had a speaker who spoke
on a subject entirely diverse from
what should have been the topic of
the day. The general impression
among the students was that the
meeting was to be entirely devoted!
to pep! instilling and to getting the
needed.snap into the players and the
followers. In place of that, a speech
was delivered that interested only
those who were contemplating The
study of law; The speech was fairly
long and all those in the hall, most
of whom had. come with the expecta-
tion of taking part in an “honest to
goodness” pep’ meeting, such as was
on tap before the W. and J., sat and
awaited the beginning of the meet-
ing that didn't start. Had it not
been for the speech made by Doctor
Riddle, the results might have been
much more disastrous than they
were. It was difficult for Cheerleader
Patrick to go. on with ms work after
‘the speaker of the day had delivered
his address, when the students’ be-
gan .. ﬁling out, and ~»liea_ded « by .m_em-"
-bers, -of the facultyI_-who left. after

 

Mr. Patterson had ﬁnished. The
plans were announced for the parade,
and a plea was made by those in
chargefor a good turnout. The as-
sembly Was warned that the State
team was good and that there would
be the battle of the year in store
for the spectators on the following
day. Captain Tommy Holleran spoke,
and he pled with the backers of his
team" to come back once again. The
very way that the students received
these pleas and took the warnings
that were given out, hinted at the. re-
ception that would be tendered to
the marshals of the parade. that was
to be held that evening when they
came out to take charge. The stu-
dents left the hall, much in the‘ Way
that ‘they would have left it had it
been a regular assembly. The great
unrest and feverish interest that
characterized the attitude of Pitt
before the W. and J‘. game was a
minus quantity.

The parade that evening came
nearest to giving Pitt a black eye
and to making it the laughing stock
of the country that anything ever did.
There were only two things that
saved the failure of that night. The
fact that the team, alone, did come
back and best S‘»taie- and also the
fact that the parade was not given
much publicity in ‘outside press or-
ganizations. There were a bare three
hundred students gathered at the re-
spective places of assembly that
evening. The spirited Dental stu-
dents, ingloriously failed in their
part. The College, the- Engineers,
the Economics School, all went back
on their team. Had it not been for
the spirit and school pride that was
shown by the women of this Univer-
sity, the evening would have gone
‘down as a miserable failure. The
work of the co-eds on that evening
saved the entire school from dis-
grace. The women turned out ‘just
as well as they did in the W’. and
J. event and they would have car-
ried the thing through on their own
shoulders had‘ they been permitted,
The marshals were helpless.- In a
school like Pitt, .there is no way that
the students can be kept together,
if they have no desire to support
their colors. Nothing was left to
do but call things off,‘ and trust to
the ability of Warner to_ turn the
';.team into the right track in the game
{the next day.__ ‘III. contrast with,-the

     

array that was presented on. the
eve of the W. and J . battle, the gath-
ering that evening looked like an
everyday gathering of the students
on their way to and from classes.
There were no red lights, no horns
and a general lack of things that go
to make a real parade. I

With the parade a failure, there
was little to look forward to at the
game the next day. The cheering
was good; but it was fa.r from out of
the ordinary. ’There was a lack of
“pull-together,” and there was a lack
of attention demonstrated when the
cheers were given discordantly and
with a lack of ﬁght.‘ The old feel-
ing of securityrwas still on top. It
might have been a good thing if the
State eleven had scored when they
recovered that ﬁrst fumble. It was
the work of the co-eds again that
saved the day. Pitt’s- women gave
the best exhibition of cheering that
they have given all year and forced
the rest of the Forbes Field into
silence when they were in action.
They ou.t-cheered the entire State
section. They stayed by the team
until. the game was brought to a
close and they upheld the dragging
honor of the school in :1 manner that
deserves the compliments of every
one who heard them.

 

THE AFTERMATH

 

“I wish I could buy a ticket to a dis-
tant point without being told where
it was, and when I got there step
off the train and lost myself. I
wouldn't want to see anybody I know
or have anything at all to think about.
Just to forget.” '

That remark, made by one of the
professors on the hill, is echoed to-
day by students, instructors, business
men, housewives everywhere. Weari-
ness is the strange new wolf that has
come to stalk the footsteps of the
world; weariness not of .ﬂesh but of
spirit, the kind of weariness that be-
fuddles the brain and__ deadens the
heart, that makes, men greet each
new day with dull, uneager eyes. The
thrill has gone out of things. The
old glad zest has left‘us, and we move
about like drugged creatures in our
little routines.

The reason is plain. We are living
in the aftermath of the strained, emo-
tion-consuming years of the War’ when

  

Jtlieivvltality of civilization was drained

away, leaving only hollowness and de-
pression behind. A smoke barrage
of ennui has settled over the earth
and it cannot be blown away in 9.
month or a year. Only the strong
winds of a new life can break the
cloud. .

That these winds will come in time
we must believe, but from where no
one can be sure. Socialists and scl-
entists, churches and schools claim to
possess the secret of their release.
Perhaps they are all deceived. Per-
haps a new star will appear in the
East and lead us back over the hills
of our tribulations to the peaceful val-
leys and sunlit hills of our fathers,
to the land where’ we can again glory
in the struggle, and feel that

“God’s in his heaven,
All“s right with the world}?

Until that time we can only “hold

fast.”

Tl-IE COLLEGE _PESSlMlST

The traditional conception of_ the
college student" has been that ‘hf a
happy-go-lucky lad, ‘a typical rah-rah
boy. His concerns were few and his.
thoughts ﬂimsy and shallow and as a
result, his thoughts -didn't amount to
very much. But, gradually, -this ‘con-
ceptionwore off§and today the‘-world
thinks of the college boy as a serious
pensive sort of a chap, earnestly con-
templating the lot of mankind. And
what is more (whether the freshman
has taken advantage of this current

say), he has gone to extremes andis
posing as a pessimist, the iconoclast
who is-satisﬁed with the poweifs that
be. He struts about the campus with
a morbidness that would make the

Pessimism in an - undergraduate-a
mere youth who has not yet begun to
see life-—-is nothing more than manl-
festation of narrow-mindedness and
limitation. Through his little ‘vision
it appears thationly is his life Which
is _perceptible_to him. ‘And of course
his perception at this stage ofithe
game could well stand another pair
of} g1as,ses,._ It is-merely a sign of
ignorance, a confession of being un-
able to see. greater whole, but of prat-
ing of that minute part of it i-‘which
he can see. The earth worm, -‘€00. TS 3-
pessimist. To him his little hole, in
the ground is the world. The bird ‘on
the-tree thinks the world is made of
twigs and leaves.

7 There may be historical precedents
. in favor of pessimism—-the fact that it,
makes for progress—but there is» lit-
tle room for it in college life where

happy are most fundamental concepts.
hiiver been propagated
against pessimism and for optimism
since the days when the union stone-
choppers were in charge of that sort
of publicity. It was agreed at that
time at a special conference attended
_by Methuselah and the ‘Grand Cabinet
of knowing ones, that taking one’s
self or one’s life too seriously was an-
other way of raising the death rate at
a rapid pace. The first time “thumbs
down”_was‘a.dopted as the official con-
demnation signal, it was against the
human‘ family of kickers later dubbed
in most approved English style,
“crabs.” . 3 - '
As a matter of fact, all reforms
were instituted not by spasmodic kick-
ers, but by cold-blooded and warm-
hearted thinkers. History will always
tell --you-that these‘ self-same‘ kickers‘
always got the 'worst of it. They
may have been in the right (‘but they
were not in the majority, and the ma-
jority counts. ‘ If its action is unwise
Keeping yourself
aloof, at afrom the majority; ‘and
if you’re notgwith them you’re against
them. .But with many of suchkickers,
it has beena case of thundering too
loud and not saying anything, or, as
Emerson put it, that they thundered
‘so loud that you couldn’t ‘hear what
they said.-——The Columbia Spe'ctator._

 

ON THE WRONG TRACK

 

Some professors will go to almost
any extreme to save their courses
from the reputation of being _“pipes."
Some students will go -to absolutely
every extreme to ‘arrange a- program
of “snap" subjects. . A - I
‘ So starts a semesterly contest to
see whether the “pipe hunter” gets
by with his little game or whether
the consciencious instructor is able
to institute a -“tightening up” to ‘elim-
inate such undesirables. So. far, the
struggle is a draw, the ultimate out-
come dependingupon which faction
will resort to the greatest extremes.

The student who has - so entirely
failed to realize,his_ purpose in col-
lege as to set his goal at the maxi-
mum number of units with the mini-
mum amount of study is not worthy
of the taxes paid to make his educa-
tion possible. Some means of ‘chang-
ing .him or .riding the .University of
-him‘ should by. all means be deviesd.
' This is just what some IJ1’0f8,SS0I‘S»
are attempting, to accomplish, but
their methods are wrong. One type

able amount of outside reading meas-
ured in mere number of pages, wheth-
eii. or not the reading is vital to an
understanding of the, course. In the
same line comes report after report
‘of a speciﬁed number of words. Many
admit that there are ‘too Vmany of
these and they ‘are too long to be
thoroughly read or corrected.  * *
'Original thinking and concentration
on: applications of the principles
learned in‘ class andgin the text are.
the elementswhich should be, intro-
duced. ‘,‘,Pipe'h-unters” will not want
courses in which they have to think.
If problems applying to the _courses
could only be assigned instead of so
much outside reading the problem
would be solved._ True, the classes
are large ‘and the ‘courses here con-
sidered areiiof the‘ less mathematical
type, but still it wouldbe practicable
to give a principle-th‘en arrange’
cases where. it‘ should — apply,‘ and ex-
pect. the student to solve them. - T

.TOO .MUCH‘ RUSHING

 

“Now that the time of frenzied
rushing is over and‘mo.st of the fra-
ternities have announced" at least par-
tial lists of pledges, the fraternity
ma.n\can' settle back in hisleasy chair,
put his feetup on the ﬁreplace, and
say what he thinks, instead of des-
perately trying to appearunterested
in some young Freshman who is made
ill. at ease by the obvious attempt at
courtesy on the part ofthe Upper
Classinaiiyno matter how heroically
he tries. _ _ - .

“Tlicre will be the usual talk of
fnot a man lost,’ and ‘a gang of good
pledges" so familiar to. one who has
been around school fora number of
years. Andoprobablyi everyone will
be more-or less satisﬁed with the re-
sults. . '

“But when one stops to think about
it, the system is a farce. There are
so many weaknesses that it would be

 

.impossible' to enumerate them with_out

making a card index. To pick a man
-with whom you are. going. to asso-
ciate constantly for the .next‘th'r'ele or
four years, after an acquaintanceship

of 30 minutes at lunch or dinner, is

absolute tomfoolery. . . , » .

‘ “One wonders that ‘fraternities ‘ex:
perience as little", internal -trouble as
they do. Th‘at'_they” do is due to the
adaptability of the college, man and
to nothing‘ else. .«Tlie‘ college man has
learned‘ through necessity to“ adapt
himself to all sortof conditions, and
he is given ample opportunity~.toiexer-
cise this accomplishment as a’ frater-
nity man. That he does this,’-and does
it successfully, is to‘ his credit. The

system -has proven the success that it

is.Tnot.because of,'but ‘ingspite of it-

“If someone‘ could dev_is,e,a work-

THE BETTERAH ‘S.Tl_JDENbT ”

_..._~_.~

Among college studentsrthere is 

_great ‘dea1_.of strivingafter the”una.t-_

’tain,able with not enough effort -spent
on going after‘ those things which lie
within the. range of reason.’ ‘Emer-
son does advise the hitching. ofyour
wagon to a star, but "hitching implies‘
the ability to get hold bf something.
In our school life there are ‘plenty
of things we"can get hold of, ample
opportunities for genius to display it-
self. Hitch on one of these: Class
activities, athletics, the school paper,
and other. ﬁelds too numerous to men-
tion. Each one of us wants to. -be fa-
vorably, known. The student who ex-
cels in academic subjects is not nec-
essarily the. one who is esteemed"
among his fellows, although one who
does not acquit himself creditably can
never hope to gain .the ‘respect of his
friends, much less.his' enemies. '
_ College inen ‘are sharp - critics if
npthingfelse and the one who ffshilly-.~
s.hallies_”, through his courses is
locked upon as a. fool, ..even though
hegmayinever betold ‘so. The active

The University Riﬂe Club has ‘tak-
en steps to affiliate itself with the
Intercollegiate Riﬂe Association and
will soon enter into active competi-
tion‘ with clubs from other in.stitu--
tions:  ' I - ]

'Since the close of the hgreat war
small-bore -riﬂe ‘shooting has become
a pjrominc'n‘t”minor- sport in many of
the." American and Canadian colleges
and universities.‘ Over {ﬁfty institu-
tions have affiliated tliemselv-es with;
the N‘ation_‘a.l'_Riﬂe Association, and
.have .participated in its annual" inter-.
collegiate _matches, and in addition
many of the college teams have car-
ried. heavy schedules of .-dual meets
in hwhich’ conspicuous’ records have
been ‘made. A‘  ' " ' '

petitors _in .. last . seasons‘ shooting
.wer_e.- the University of -Pennsylv,ania,
‘winners of the Na_.tional_ Riﬂe Associa-
tion's Intercollegiate Match for .1922;
Norwich University, which.has been
producing :teams of (cham-pzionyship_
ca.1i«br'e for the past ﬁve years; Yale,
which ' won eighteen of its’ twenty
d-u‘a'l matches and decisiviely defeated
Oxford and McGill  in international
shoots, Dartmouth, Princeton, George»
town-,  I. T., Drexel Institute of
Pliiladelphia, Iowa State”,Cthe Univer-
f_sityj}~cf' Washington and the Univer-
-sity_.of.Ca1if,ornia. Many’, other insti-L
tutions, small as well as large, made

as .a_ sport in which the small col-
leges-have equal ‘opportunities, with
the “‘big’ fellows,” ‘and ‘often furnish
unexpected upsets. ’ ' - W

Riﬂe sh.ooting‘is unique in being
the only 'col]‘e-ge sport in which itis un-
iiecessaiyior the opposing teams to
meet ,on"jthe some ﬁeld. As the bulk
of the _ shovoting is-‘_._done" on indoor
ranges, weather _ conditions may-_be
negl-e-cted, andthe match can be car-
ried on with each team shooting on
its home range and exchanging scores:
by telegraph. ‘Thus itis ‘possible to
carry on intersectional matches
without the expense of travel to 2.-
common meeting place, so that the
schedule of . an Eastern‘ college riﬂe
te'am. may -throw it into competition
not only with its neighboring rivals,
"but. with the leading: universities of
the .-:_S'O11t1l, the West, ’Canada and
Great Britain. -‘F0-1' example, in the
pasttwo seasons the Yale riﬂe team
had met in competition not only

competes in many of pits major and
minor sports,’ but also Alabama. Poly-
tec.hnic,, Iowalystate ’,University, the
University of Washington, "McGill
University of -Montreal, and‘ Oxford.
’Univ_er”sity. 'AWith the latter, Yale
holds an annual match " conducted
with the»-l1-elp of the trans-Atlantic
cables. Of course, under such con-
ditions controversies and close deci-
sions‘ on scoring frequently-A arise,
and”.i.n'these the headqua1‘ter of the

._.llIIlllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll"IIilllllllllllllllillllli

'ingt_‘on is. looked. to as the ﬁnal tar-
'.b-iteiiﬁ . However, ‘during the-_ last two
years the -need has been ‘felt of a dis-
tinctive ‘college organization for
standardizing. intercollegiate shooting
conditions, with the result that in
the" spring of 1921 the Princeton,
Yale and Columbia managyémen-ts
met to form an ‘Intercollegiate As-
sociation of Affiliated Rifle Clubs,
openrfor membership to all college
riﬂe clubs affi_liated.with the " Nation-
a1 Riﬂe Association. During-5tl:e— sea-
son of 1922‘its membersiiipingluded
fonrteeii ' colleges‘ and universities:

sity, Norwich, Princeton, '- Syracuse,

Besides the standardizatio_n‘ of "con-'
ditions for. “ college dual meets, the‘
association has an important’ func-‘
tion in the ranking of the collegef
teams and of their individual shoot-'
ers, and-_ for this purpose it has plan-_

  _ PITTINTHEEAST, . V. _
The announcement that the Panthers will ‘play in New York ‘during the.
.1923 football- season is of great importance and interest. Pitt is at last,
ﬁlling a long‘de,manded appearance in.th'c East. . For the’ last seven years the
Easterncritics. have heard a great deal of Pitt's prowess on‘the gridiron,
but have not had -an‘ opportunity to see the Panthers in action ‘on their home
stamping grounds. This inabislity to'.v_vitness the Panthers has no doubt re-
sulted in an underrating of’ the ‘Panthers in the grand football resume at the
‘end of the season. ,_ Pitt is undoubtedly making a. great step forward ‘in play-
ing‘ beforcthe’ _crowds of Gotham- The game bringing together -two of the
ranking football team's_'of the East is" sure ‘to -attract a crowd that will tax
the capacity of the Yankees'_ new" stadium ancl’will probablybethe feature-
contest of the season. ' V. » . V — - V 5 — ‘

 

, i._ . AGRAND SEASON . _ ‘- _ 2,‘ - ‘
Despite twoearly season defeats the-Panthers completed their regular
"season in a. blaze of, glory. ,The manner in, which .the»-Panthers deveioped:
from a grce,n,_agregatioIV1 of players into a weVll-o'iled’macl*iine of stars has
been: little short of phenomenal. '2SoVme"of’our ~“crap'Ve hangers?’ could see
nothVinVg but a disastrous season after the reverses suffered at the hands of
thVe~MVo‘un1:aineersV..anVd Lafayette. .Bu.t the much desircd- victories over W. &
J_. and_Pen‘n State~has-completely obliterated the defeatsiwhich today we
consider but stepp_ing stones to greater successes.’ ~

' 1 T V _ AN EASTERN LRANKINVGA ,i . . _.i
The New York Times has’ recently made a ranking, of the Eastern /teams
as follows: _ 1V. Pri|'1ccton;.2. Army and -‘Cornell; 3. PITTSBURGH,'vPenns'yl-i_
Vania, and Syrac’us,é;» _4., Harvard, Navy ‘and West Virginia; 5. Yale; 6. La-

.BostonV College, Buc«knell,VGe_orgetown ‘and _Holy Cross; 10. Carnegie Tech,
Springfield and. Vermont. - ~ ~ . - ‘ - ' .- g‘ V

‘ Pitt is placed high amongtbe leading teams of the. East. It is interesting
to note that the Panthers ,are‘pl_aced well above the two teams~_tlrat defeated
themiearlier itrthc season‘. In addition‘ the Westerri.Pennsylvaman district
has four of the greatest -teams in the eastern section in Pitt,-Carnegie Tech,

would just name the entire Pitt squad. ' That looks as good and better than
any team the experts can brmg forth. ' ‘

What about the crowds at next year’s games? Where are they going‘
to put them? There seems to be only one solution--a new StadlUm- The
rapid growth of the Alumni Association and the rapid rise of the Panthers
to the leading role in the East demands Increased seating capacity. A new
