UNIVERSITY or PITTSBURGH

Dr. Scalapino Discusses

“There is one and only one
issue now confronting the Unit-
ed States and Communist coun-
tries; shall there be a unified
Communist Vietnam or two "sep-
arate Vietnams,” emphasized Dr.
Robert A. Scalapino to a large,
attentive audience in Langley
Hall yesterday in a lecture en-
titled, “Why Vietnam?”

Scalapino contendsthat a Unit-
ed States “withdrawal from
South Vietnam and Southeast
Asia would be crucial in start-
ing the Third World War; Asia
would flounder in its own poli-
tical and‘ economic chaos.

Taking Asia as a whole,
Scalapino, .who has traveled
widely in that area remarked

' that only three years ago (1961-

62), the Peking-Djkarta alliance
established a strong sphere of
inﬂuence in the Pacific, berated
the United States and the Unit-
ed Nations, and could possibly
have destroyed the latter. At
that time, both Indonesia and
China fought against the newly
established Malaysia,’ and China
was" a major contributer to the
India-Pakistan war, Scalapino
added.

Today, China itself is in tur-
moil; the Djkarta-Peking alli-
ance is no more, and Malaysia is
at peace, Scalapino noted. He

continued that the United States’ A"

presence in southeast Asia,
“buys time and provides hope
for eventual political stability.”

In suggesting that, “Asia. is
now what Europe" was in the

1940’s,” Scalapino said that the
United States is not “a police-
man to the world.” He men-
tioned that in some areas of the
world American committments
‘are crucial, for not only peace,
but also- for the economic sta-
bility of our own country. He
sighted Japan as a main outlet
for U.S. goods, and noted that
we have established a, “vital re-
lationship” with the Japanese
both culturally and scientifical-
ly.

Scalapino pointed out that
there is, “Not need for a simul-
taneous committment in Africa
or Asia,” for in those continents.
there is no pressing need ‘for
political equilibrium.

It is fallicious to believe that
the United States is fighting “a
Holy War against communism
in Asia,” according to the Berk-
ley professor; People holding
this View are only protesting
against the policy makers of the
country. After all, he continued,
“Who started the violence in
Southeast A sia, President
Johnson or Mao Tse Timg;
The Communist believe in us-
ing any means to achieve their
end. Pacifism will not work.”‘

Turning to Vietnam proper,
Scalapino emphasized. t h a t,
there is, “No evidence that the
majority (of the Vietnamese
people) wants a Communist
dominated government.” Over
a million people have defected
from the North to the South.
The war in Vietnam is not a

  
   
   
   
   
    
  
  
   
   
  
    
  
     
  
  
   
 
     
    
  
 
  
  
 
    
     
  
      

"removal of U.S. troops Would.‘

Wednesday, March 22, 1967

Civil war, although in a sensef‘
the Vietnamese people‘ are"
fighting each other, remarked
the professor. A boundary has
been violated, turning the 
pute into a regional and inter-
national one, he clarified, the
communists are the first to ads,
mit this. —  ‘;.

Concerning the supposed U.
S. and North Vietnamese’ viol-’
ations of the geneva agre-
ement, Scalapino stated that
the issue, “hinges on free and
fair elections.” Until the pres-
ent, there has been no possi-i _.
bility of free elections in the ,
whole of Vietnam, for’ the- ’
Communists neither permit 
rivals or campaigning in their-]
elections. Scalapino surmised '
that sometime in the future  
premier Ky may civilianize and it
run for the presidency. ‘

In the military end of the War,
Scalapino said.‘ that two years
ago the South was rapidly losing
the war, one year ago a state of-
stability was reached, and- to-1
day, the tide has turned in fav-
or of the allies. The United
States has had troops on ailarge .
scale present only for the past
eighteen months, he added.

In conclusion, Scalapino re-.
marked that, the bombing and

not end‘ the bloodshed; there is
“No moral argument to let the
communists take over by force". 

If no damage is inﬂicted upon ..
Communist territory, they will
never co-me to the peace“ table,
said Scalapino in ending.

  BOYS Cite System Unfair   S

by DAN LICHTENSTEIN

The Vietnam War has ex-
ploded the selective service
system, an aspect of the arm-
ed forces usually‘ taken for
granted, into one of the most
serious problems for college
students today. As the draft
and its alternatives grab
headlines, so do those people
most effected by the system.
The ‘active opponents of the

A Faculty Committee for Viet-
nam Teach-in and Students for
Peace are making plans for a
University Teach-in on the war
in Vietnam. The teach-in will
take place between 7 p.m. and
1 a.m. on Friday, March 31, in
the SU Ballroom.

Faculty members will partici-
pate-in a ‘series of lectures, de-
bates and panels on a variety of
topics, including the war and
American foreign policy, -th_e.in-

credibility gap in relation to the
war and peace alternatives and
proposals. »

Following each of the period
programs there will be a ques-
tion and answer period between
the members of the audience
and the speakers.

The program will be arranged
so. that the audience will be able
to select those panels and dis-
cussions -in which they are par-

   
  
   

 

draft, the demonstrators and
“Vietniks',” monopolize the pub-
licity. But what about the ma-
jority of students who do not
demonstrate or sit in?

Several male students were
polled in the dorm area on their
opinions of the draft and its
alternatives. Their overall opin-
ion of the draft as it stands now
is that the system is unfair. All
those polled are happy with
their deferments, ‘but they ad-
mit that student deferments fav-
or those with enough money to
afford a college education. One
boy even stated, “It’s like buy-
ing a deferment.”

While most University stu-
dents may feel sorry for the in-
dividual who does not have their
security, they wouldn’t join him.
Most students plan on attend-
ing graduate school in any case.
Others will consider post grad-
uate work more seriously ifit
proves to be the only way to
retain a deferment -after four
years’ of college.

This. thirst for education is
not an unpatriotic attitude; it
is a realistic, ‘ selﬁsh one. “Sel-
ﬁsh” is the word almost every
student used. The majority feel
that everyone should serve his

  ,s__0me way,_but__ ‘as in-‘ I

 

‘fore. Students admit it would:

  

  
  
   
     
 
  
   
    
   
  
  
   
  
  
  
    
  
  
      
    
    
      
    
   
    
  
   
  
    
  

dividuals, they’d rather see -
someone else serve until they
are ready to go into the_ army.

For this reason, most students
advocate the alternative of tak-
ing 19 years olds ﬁrst. In this
way, they can see an individual
serving the United States with-9
out risking induction from col-
lege or a disasterous ‘gaprbe
tween undergraduate and post
graduate study. ‘

Despite the controversy on the
draft, ROTC is not taken any
more or less seriously than be?-

be nice to go into the army as-
a commissioned officer, but ‘most
are not willing to be obligated
to join immediately after grad-
uation. They prefer taking their?
chances. A .

The average male student.
does not want to be drafted}
right now any more than the
rabid demonstrator does. He is ‘i
not being unpatriotic, he just‘
likes his freedom and wants to“-
complete his education. The facl .
that the education carries» with’-
it. a deferment from the armed-‘.1
forces makes him feel it is even -
more desirable. But the defer-’*=
ment is not the m2'son».d’et'r,e..ifo‘ A

— Black Power

Negro Must Express Identity

Dr. Richard L. Rubenstein dis-
cussed “black power”. with a
small group of interested peo-
ple in the YM and WHA Friday
afternoon. He deﬁned “black
-power” as the Negro quest for
a sense of dignity, of sense of
his own identity.

VVhen the Negro learned a
language, it was that of some-
body else, as was his religion,
stated Rubenstein. Malcolm X
wrote in his Autobiography that
the» Negro must not use the
-white man’s religion. Since many
slaves had been Moslerns, Mal-
colm X felt that this would be
the religion for Negroes to fol-
low." He wrote also about being
“conked,” that is, having his
hair straightened, and the ex-
treme unhappiness he felt in
trying to look like someone else
and failing. Malcolm X then
decided, “I can't let Wlhitey tell
me who I am,” Rubenstein add-
ed.

Dr. Rubenstein compared the
Negro situation to the “most
powerful Jewish group who re-
jected their own tradition and
tried to be as ‘WASP’ as possi-
ble. It is bound to a sense of
failure and an inability to deal
with life in a way that makes
sense.” '

Thus, the Negro must reject,

his Sambo role-—that of being
either a boy or an uncle, but
never a man—-and he must re-

" ject the white world and the

white church, continued the
rabbi.

Dr. Rubenstein‘ stated that
“pressure. must -be exerted;

power. But a community with-
out power cannot use violence.
Violence only Works if you are
strong enough to carry it
through. It could conceivably go
to genocide.

“The Negroes must learn les-
sons from the Jewish people.

in the process of coming to
grips with Western domina-
tion. Taken from the novel
‘by James Michener which
bears the same title; Hawaii
exposes a panorama of a
beautifully colorful and tra-
dition-rich culture.

The plot, which I feel is a bit
weak, tells of a group of reli-
gious fanatics who are sent
from New England andgwhose
job ‘it is to educate the savages
in the teachings of Jesus. What
the movie is trying to say is
stated very clearly within the
ﬁrst ﬁve minutes — that the

.Hawaiians were joyous warm

people before the missionaries
arrived, and when they were
ﬁnished with their gift of Chris-
tian charity, “the people appear-
ed coarse and traditionless. The
missionaries made the’ natives
appear like persons ofNew Eng!

Marijuana History

  

New In This Century

Reprinted from the Feb. 4 edition
of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette
For 2,000 years, on and off,

marijuana has been related (jus-
tiﬁably or not), to crime and
violence. It even inspired a word
for murder. In 1090 A.D., a Per-

sian named Ilasan formed a Mid-

dle Eastern version of Murder

Incorporated, whose members‘

smoked hashish (marijuana) be-
fore each killing. The group
was called the Hashishin ——a
name which later evolved into
“assassin.” _
But not until 30 years ago did
the United States -have strict
la-ws against it. As late as 1930,

only 16 states regulated mari-
juana use——and not very string-
ently at that.

Then, in 1937, the Marijuana
Tax ‘Act was passed, making un-
regulated sale of “pot” a federal_
oﬁense. It remains on the for-
bidden list today. Besides the
federal law, 49 states (Missis-
sippi is the exception) have
their own regulations governing;
its use and distribution.

A first offense can bring a
violator a jail sentence of up to
10 years—40 years if the seller
is over 18 years old and the buy-
er under that age. Third offen-
ders draw 10 to 40 years.

  Cheating Problem Discussed

by NAN ISEN
“Twenty per cent of fresh-
men in a representative sam-
pling at America’s colleges

admit to cribbing on an ex-

amination in the past year,”
reported the Michigan Daily
Jan. 8. This finding included a
survey of 206,865 current fresh-
men at 251 colleges and univer-
sities across the natio-n, and was
released bythe American Coun-
cil on Education.

Here at the University-' the
cheating problem has apparent-
ly reached an acute stage. There

is no set ,University policy on ‘

cheating; ,each professor estab-
ishes his own penalties. Many‘
students feel that his in itself

believe that there is no tradition
preventing it. -
Reasons for cheating vary
from. individual to individual.
Obtaining a good grade in a
course, escaping the draft, or
“naturally, doesn’t everyone,”
have become frequent excuses.
Some students contend that at-
tending classes interferes with
their social life, the only alterna-
tive for staying in school is to
cheat. Still others experience a
sense of thrill and ‘ rebellion

times feel compelled to cheat

When questioned, most stu-

Ca.mpus”——Page 6)
by ALAN DISLER
and DAVE BELLET

Although it is generally ac-
cepted among the cognoscenti
that some University students
smoke marijuana, the consensus
among student sources suggests
that the .exen‘.t and range of stu-
dents smoking pot may surprise
those with the most blase of at-
titudes.

According to one student who
regularly smokes, “Over 500
students at Pitt have tried it or
are "now using it.” He added
that “people who generally
smoke know or have heard of
others who do. It’s a commun-
ity in itself.”

Who smokes? It must ‘be said
that the students who smoke do
not ﬁt into any real niold or-
stereotype. Fraternity men and
sorority girls, dorm students,
apartment people; in fact, every
segment "of jthe student body
contains its pot-ushers. '

Certain fraternity houses, in
fact, have become centers for
the distribution and use of,mari-
juana. One fraternity ‘house was
searched by city agents last
summer.‘ /

According to student sources,
“smoking goes on to a certain
degree in the girls’ dorms, in-
cluding Tower C and particu-
larly Holland Hall. The men's
dorms are decidely less used
for this purpose, although the
reek of pot has been known to
emanate from some rooms.

tate the student, discourage learn-
ing through lack of incentive,
and imply that a student is too
stupid to learn the course ma-

\terial. One boy stated that many

professors do not devote all of
their time to teaching, but have
other part-time jobs, and can-
not spend enough time with in-
dividual students. Still another

emphasized that the professors,

are aware of the amount of
cheating in their courses, but
are helpless  do anything
about it.

- The aforementioned excuses
are not the only however. A, One
professor «re-emphasized th e
pressure for obtaining good
grades and the pressure of so-
ciety in general today. Another
explained that on a large scale
deception and dishonesty run
rampant in our society, especial-
ly in the field of advertising and
commercialism through_ use of
the mass media. This deception

f_orrns the directives for the

youth of the country and is not

' corrected early enough. Several
professors expressed dismay on V

,  Use o Marijuana i
Long’ Bu‘ Legislation Reaches Dorms And Frats .

The greatest amount of mari-
juana use takes place in off-
campus apartments, particular-
ly Shadyside. The recent raid
of a Shadyside apartment by
local officers netted several Pitt
students. ‘

‘e Why do students smoke? One
student does it for “relaxation
and enjoyment and also for in-
terospection.” Another explains
it thus: “People are walking‘
around with unwarranted hang-
ups, that is, people get up tight
with themselves. They seem to
care about so many unimpor-
tant things, such as complete‘
social approval—being liked by
everyone else. Too many people

‘cannot accept somebody as _a

person, they are more interested
in superﬁcialities such as cloth-
es, car, income. Few people
judge other people on face val-
ue alone. By smoking one is
able to see into the world around
 And all the phoniness is
more easily perceived. Your
mind is relaxed and you're at
case. One is not so concerned
with playing roles. You’re be-
ing yourself.” _

Another student commented

that “Drinking is an escape out
of reality, whereas smoking is

— an escape into ‘ reality because

you are going into your real, or
true self. There is nothing wrong
with the real world, but I feel
that one of the problems of to-
day is that fewer ‘and fewer
people are introspecting.”

To many marijuana users,
pot smoking is much more de-

ing at the moment. Look maga- .

zine, Jan. 24, in reporting the
Air Force Academy cheating
scandal of a‘ year ago, stated
that the success of an honor
system depends on the transmit-
ting of values from one class to
another.

The University has no such
tradition, so stated the Liberal
Arts Cabinet report “Honor
must come from the students.
In many universities from
Princeton: to Stanford, anyone
who fails to report a violation
is also guilty. The ‘rat is an hon-
or system's weakest point. Stu.-

dents dislike reporting others.,

At; the Acedemy, the unofficial
standard of honor actually dic-
tated silence.” the article re-
ported. It was for this reason
that the universities of Texas

' and! Illinois discontinued honor

systems, and partially for this
reason that the Liberal Arts
Cabinet respected the honor code
for the University.

The recently instituted pass-

,, fail system will not help -curb

cheating either. Students stated

” that they will still cheat in or-

der to pass a course.

sirable than drinking alcohol. A 
student ' comments: “Most peo-1.‘

smoke have given up drinking
almost entirely.”

The trend appears to be in
the direction of increased 
juana use on campus. A stu-
dent user stated, “Many more
people are trying it because it

many are doing it because its a’
new kick to them.” However,
this student added that “smol{-}
ing for kicks will prevent its
legalization.” , \ .

Another student said tha
“Generally speaking, the more
who are exposed to marijuana
the better.”

One of the great criticisms of
marijuana use is that it leads
to dope addiction. Several stu-
dies have denied this correla-
tion, and student users on cam{
pus have said they do not 
tend to “graduate” to such ad-
dictive drugs as heroine and.co-
caine. _  .—.
“I would never take narcotics,”
declared one smoker. “Most__peo-
ple who smoke regularly know
the differences between the vari-
ous types of drugs.” He added
that “tile psychedelics (mari-
juana, LSD,.etc.) affect the 
and the process of thinking,
whereas the narcotics (heroine,
cocaine, etc.) essentially affect
the physical processes. it

Another student smoker com-
mented that “anyone who sticks
a needle in his arm has reach-
ed a point of no return.”

Concerning official investiga-
tions of the Pitt campus, it is
known that plainclothes federal
and city narcotics agents have
been on campus for over a year.
According to one source, city
agents “stick out like a sore
thumb,” but federal agents are
difficult to spot. --

Agents of the Federal Nar-
cotics Bureau generally arrive 5-
on a campus and size up the .
situation and conduct a surgery, ’
regardless of the policy of the, "E
school administration." Sources 
indicate that this has been done
on the Pitt, campus.

No arrests have yet‘ been
made on campus in connection
with marijuana, but federal

agents are reported to be con-
centrating now on marijuana
use in Pitt fraternity houses,
with special attention on the
house searched this summer. 

One source has stated that 
student in one of the profes-
sional schools and living  on
campus _ has been gathering in-
formation on marijuana use at
Pitt in ' close cooperation with
federal authorities. ’.

The University has no olficial
policy on drugs, but unofficially,
the attitude is that students
should be encouraged to‘ dis-,
cuss their problem with the
Dean of Men and Dean of 
en's staffs. ' The prevalent View
in the administration seems to
be that instead of turning in stui

U" Birth Control

by DAN BOOKER
and BERNI MCLEOD
In one sense, birth control
is nothing new. Hundreds of
years ago, monarchs sought
ways to assure that only one
, son was born to them. In-
deed, the first planned par-
enthood society 'was formed
around 1850. But in another,
perhaps more significant
_ sense, birth control is new.
The possible impacts and
consequences of widespread
birth control policies would be
enormous in today’s society.
This is heightened by the know-
ledge that never before have
conception retarding processes
been so simple to apply, nor as
effective, ,
Though ' contraceptives ‘cer-
tainly are most widely used
among older people, it is {the
16-25 age group that receives
the most attention on this mat-
ter. For these teenagers and
young adults, it is argued, mod-
 ern contraceptives -provide an
-“out” for sexual enjoyment‘min-
us ‘the strings of responsibility.
-‘And for everyone well-healed in
conventional American moral-
y, any type of extra-marital
sexual relations is not to be
tolerated. ‘ z
"This is one of the biggest as-
pects of discussion on morality
on American campuses. So,
what is. the situation alt Pitt?
How does the University feel
about birth control and what is

this ‘whole area of morality?

Editorial: D

The purpose of our supplement on Campus Morality is not to indulge
'-in a sensational expose of life on our University campus. To those who
question our taste in dealing with our chosen subject areas, we reply that,
given a topic to explore such as morality at this University, we had an obli-
4 gation. as journalists to portray-each subject as we discovered it.

Every article was done with careful investigation, with one primary
. goal in mind——to realistically picture every area withwhich we dealt. To
. the best of our knowledge, we fulfilled this requirement.
7 Most of the information uncovered by our reporters is common knowl-
P edge to a majority of ou'r University community. On the subject of drugs
on campus, however, our reporter was told that “the extent and range of V.

level,” says Dean of Women Sa-
Vina Skewis, “social restrictions
should be self-imposed. The Uni-
versity does not frown on off-
campus housing for women for
moral reasons, because our
dorms weren’t devised for mor-
al protection.”

This area of off-campus =hous-
ing for women is one that has

  

is idle and the information hasn’t been acted upon by students who say they
know and are distressed by what is happening.

We are not condemning smoking per se and have no right to pass
judgment on what people do in private and away from this campus. But
we cannot condone smoking in" dormitories and fraternities, because it in-
fringes upon the rights of those people who do not wish to smoke and
places them in the difficult position of either being a party to an unlawful
act or committing the ‘distasteful act of informing on their friends. Fur-
thermore, widespread smoking in the dormitories and fraternities would
tend to force the administration to take drastic steps. That the administra-
tion hasn’t done so is to its credit.

In the Drug Policy is-sued earlier this term by Dean of Student Af-
fairs Helen P. Rush, the following stand was taken. “A student who hon-

estly seeks help is never turned-over to civil authorities unless that person

Despite these official reasons
for the on-campus policy, the
general feeling of interviewed
students was expressed by one
senior girl who said, “It is very
unrealistic to try to deny that
parents, and thus the school, is
not concerned about the sexual
activity of students.”

The attitude of University ad-

been used as an example of
the University protecting, the
“moral interests” of its students.
For many years, on-campus or
at-home housing for women stu-
dents was required, by the Unii
ve_rsity. Dean Skewis attributed
this ‘both to poor housing in the
area and the traditional protec-
tion that society has required
for women. .

Of the 2,200 women students

--under 21 and in need of area

housing,- 1,490 live on campus,
while only 53 live in apartments.
Presently, women with 60 cred-
its plus parental permission may
live off campus.

ministrators on birth control it-
self might be difficulft to dis-
cern, but the Student Health
Service does have a deﬁnite po-
licy on the prescription of birth
control preparations. This in it-
self is unique in that a ‘national
survey of student health serv-
ices showed that only 19 of the
315 schools polled did have a
written policy.

The policy here, drafted by
Dr. Douglass Thompson, direc-
tor of the health services, pro-
vides, “Birth control medication,
for birth control purposes, will
not‘ be prescribed to unmarried
students with the exception of
those who are within a month
of becoming married.” Even in
this exception, if the student is

under 21, parental permission is .

needed.

When birth control medication
is prescribed for certain dis-
eases, the health center again

_requires parental permission if

the student is under 21 and /not
married, However, at the bot-
tom of the written policy is a
note, “Should you (health cen-
ter staff doctors. and consul-

tants) feel that an exception

should be made in an individual

’ case, I would be happy to dis-

cuss the matter with you.”
Dr. Thompson explained that
this note recognizes that there

 

maybe cases when a student

  

ture to handle all the physical
and psychological consequences

of premarital relations. “In gen-.

eral, however,” noted Thomp-
son, "the "typical student is not
mature enough to handle these
things.

“We do operate slightly with-
in the University framework and
parents have certain expecta-
tions of a university health serv-

ice,” continued Thompson. “Also,

we must be concerned with the
total health of the student, and
it is not in the best interest of
most people's health to engage
in extramarital sexual inter-
course.”

Students at Boston University
recently demanded that their
university distribute birth con-
trol medications. Whatever this
the basis that non-distribution
did not take into account the
fact of growing abortion and
illegitimate birth rates. Dr.
Thompson commented that these
certainly are facts with some
validity, but we “shouldn’t build
on this foundation; we should
try to alter the facts.” He said
that the only active way the
health service tried to do this
was by ‘speaking personally to
individuals who ask for infor-
mation or devices.

The request by students for
contraceptives is fairly occasion-
al, according to Thompson. The
health center policy prohibits

«most prescription of birth con-

trol medications. Whatever this
policy, contraceptive devices can
be had easily enough in the
area. Men can get “personal
items” by seeing the managers
of local stores. Women who al-
ready have a prescription for
such medication can get it ﬁll-
ed as often as desired and dis-
tribute it to fellow students.

It is a fact that students do
get the medication. Dr. Thomp-
son quoted an -“extremely tenu-
ous statistic” of 20 per cent for
the number of studnts at Pitt
who use birth control nrugs for
birth control purposes. This
must indicate a good deal of stu-
dent‘ disbelief in the traditional
moral values concerning sex.
pparently gone is the puritan
idea that right is right, wrong is
wrong, and there is no middle
area. ,

a long time,” remarked a junior

endangers the life and well-being of ‘others or infringes on the rights of
others in a way that can only be dealt with by civil liberties.”

This insures students involved that they will be protected, if at all
possible. We know of past instances, too, when the University has behaved
commendably in dealing with individual cases.

We applaud this enlightened attitude and feel that it is a step in the
right direction in alleviating a very complex situation. ’

  Does She Or Doesn’t She — Maybe

every experience possible before
they are even out of their teens.
Who the hell would want to be
sexually perfect" at age 21?”

Polled students largely feel
that peer group condemnation
of pre-marital sex has dropped,
adult condemnation is as strong
as ever, and the pill is chang-
ing our morality.

“I think that most people feel i

as I do,” said a student. “We
feel that sleeping around is
wrong because its insincere. Be-
yond that everything depends
on the people involved. I would
certainly not drop a friend for
that reason alone.”

“I think that most people in
college are quite understand-
ing,” said another, “and don’t
have black or white attitudes on
premarital sex. The ‘mom told
me that this is wrong’ idea is
out. You have to know a. lot
more about the individuals and
cicumstances in each case.”

“I think parents are against
premarital sex, as always,” add-
ed another girl. However, I
know how they act toward {their
own children, though.”

Several people felt that birth
control pills were helping to
bring about a change toward
more realistic morals.

“With the reduced threat of
pregnancy,” remarked a senior,
“we now focus on a considera-
tion of the actual act, rather
than the consequences. I feel
that we often have artiﬁcial
judgments, and set arbitrary
limits.”

The student consensus seems
to be that the black-white sep-
aration is no longer tenable.
This would come as a shock
only to those who have been
separated from'even the vaguest
descriptions of modern life offer-
ed in newspapers and maga-
zines.

‘ But another aspect of the stu-
dent comments was that they
emphasized individual judgment
and recognized few overall iron-

The easiest way to steal
an item from any of the
shops -in this area is to walk
in wearing a large winter
overcoat and simply stuff the
article into one of the deep
pockets when no one is looking.
Or perhaps you’d rather steel
a record from the National Rec-
ord Mart down on Forbes Ave-
nue. You could fudge it a bit
and not really steal an expen-
sive record if you think your
conscience would hurt. The way
to do this is (to take a $5 clas-
sical record and place it in the
jacket of a cheaper Herman's
Hermits record and thus save
about three dollars. Or you
could be really sly and jam one
record in a jacket with another
and walk out with two for the

‘ price of one.

You have probably heard of
these methods of shoplifting and

of ‘theft deﬁnitely exists on this
campus. Yet just as deﬁnitely
as the problem exists, the stores’
salesmen in the area do not con-
sider it a serious problem in re-
lation to the University. The
one exception is the University
book center Where any thievery
almost has ‘to point to Pitt stu-
dents simply because they repre-
sent over 75 per cent of the
store's customers.

Pitt students are also a large
percentage of the clientelle of
the few clothing stores, record
stores and drug stores in {the
immediate vicinity. Yet not one
of these stores feels alarmed
enough about shoplifting to al-
low a percentage of its budget
for loss by theft. The salesmen
are unanimous in their belief
that Pitt students are for the
most part honest, high caliber
people. Not one of the shop em-
ployees feels that shoplifting is
any more of a problem here just
because of the proximity to a
college ‘campus, In fact, all of
the salesmen interviewed made
a deﬁnite and unmistakable
poinrt not to inculpate any col-
lege students or Pitt students
in particular.

Rather, the salesmen feel that
younger children are more of a

- problem regarding shoplifting.

One employee in the record
store considers high school stu-
dents, in‘ particular, as more
likely to steal than college stu-
dents. He stated, “Most of the
lifters aren't college kids.”

In addition, every salesman
will readily admit that the prob-
lem exists with regard to adults
as well-. Said one saleslady in the
Tweed Shop, “We have such a
variety of clientelle that we
can't really say it's the college
kids who stea .”

However, this does not fully
exonerate the college student. A
nation Wide survey showsthat
24.8 per cent of those discovered
shoplifting are" 12 to 17 years
old with another 24.8 per cent,
18 to 20. This nationwide statis-
tic obviously indicates older
high school and younger college
students are more apt to*shop-
lift. Why- One salesman sug-
gested that students would tend
to have less responsibility than
an older person and less money.

Is lack of money a feature in
shoplifting. According to stu-
dents as well as salesmen in this
area, it is probably the least
common and least important
reason for stealing. The thrill
of trying to get away with a
theft is easily the most dom-

- inant and most talked ‘ of mo-

tive for shoplifting here.
Logically, what college stu-

dent paying hundreds of dollars, .

in the case of out of staters)
could not afford a 60 cent paper
back book or an 80 cent 45 rpm
record? One student of a very
comfortable background paying
above expenses plus a substan-
tial amount for a fraternity ex-
plained when asked why he lift-
ed a bottle of shoe polish, “I
don’t know, I guess I was just
too cheap to pay for it.”

The vast majority of such an-
swers will begin with, “I don't
know . , .” Why did three boys
go out one night to grab every
local street sign they could pos-
sibly get their hands on? “I
don’t know, I've always loved
to steal signs.”

An instance of collegiate shop-
lifting is rarely a determined,
premeditated crime. Instead, it
is a whimsical, spur of the mo-
ment action. One salesman liken-
ed it to the murder in Albert
Camus’ The Stranger: an unex-
plainable, sudden movement, the
physical result of a mood.

For instance, one girl in a
clothing store bet her friend that
the latter would not dare to
walk out wearing a stolen hat
as if it had been her -own. The
ﬁrst girl lost her bet.

Incidentally, no salesman was '

able to say which sex was .more
apt to shoplift. One, when ex-
plaining what he would do if he
caught a thief, said, “I would
try to talk to the boy . . .” Yet
even this one would not accuse
boys any more than girls.
Almost every young thief, up-

on leaving the scene of his suc- -

cessful crime, will not gloat

over the money saved, but more -

over the fact that he had the
nerve and cleverness to carry
out his little venture into the
world of crime. -

Any such thrill seekers in the
immediate area will not have
much of a challenge for their
cleverness, for only the Univer-
sity book store uses positive
safeguards against shoplifters.
The other storekeepers inter-
viewed use only (their own sharp
eyes to watch for thieves.

However, if a thief’s clever-

ness is not enough and he gets

caught, he will not have too

much to worry about. He will

ﬁrst be asked to \return the
stolen item, then the conse-
quences will depend more upon
the preserit mood of the store-
keeper than upon anything else.
No one interviewed ‘would im-
mediately summon the police.

Again the exception, only the {

University book store would
take direct action and inform
the Dean of Student Affairs.

The local storekeepers are not
sure what they would do if they
caught a thief simply because
they haven’t thought about it.
This casualness indicates that
in the local stores frequented by
Pitt students, drug, record and
clothing stores, the salesmen do
not consider the college shop-

lifter a major problem. They X

feel that younger kids are more
apt to steal and that adults are
almost as likely themselves.

Still, they do not set aside
any portion of their budgert for
thefts from any age _g'I‘011P-
When a Pitt student does shop-
lift, it will almost always be for
a thrill on the spur of the mo-
ment. If he does not escape the
watchful eye of the salesman,
the only burglar alarm as such
that he has to contend with, he
will get off with probably little
more than a reprimand and
some embarrassment.

The University Book Center
is different from those common
consumer stores simply because
it services _. the University com-

n  S 1-’.

 

 

the University cannot possibly
avoid the book store. Therefore,
according to J. C. Langstaff,
director of Auxiliary Enter-
prises, of which the Book Center
is a part, although known cases
of shoplifting among non Pitt
students have occurred, it must
be _surmised that of the un-
known cases of Ythievery, 75 per
cent of the -thieves are Pitt stu-

‘ dents.

Perhaps because Pitt students
fall within the age groups more

inclined toward shoplifting, the

Book Center takes more precau-
tions than the other stores here.
Besides the numerous mirrors
about the store to help the sales-
ladies watch for shoplifters, ‘uni-
formed and non-uniformed se-
curity guards are employed at
the busiest times of the school
year. The guards are there for
general control as well as for
discouraging shoplifters.

However, Langstaff feels that
the book store here is in abet-
ter position than its counterpart
in most other schools because
it has fewer articles that would
attract the common shoplifter..
The book store is a 100 per cent
academic store with a bare mini-
mum of the normal consumer
goods. Who besides an anthro-
pology student would take the
risk or evenbother to steal an
anthropology ltext book? The
book store's classical record col-
lection is one of the best in this
city, but how many people, es-
pecially those who would stoop
to thievery, are after classical
records as compared to popular
releases? Of course, this limita-
tion to academic articles def-
initely indicates that when an
item-is stolen, it is most prob-
ably stolen by a student.

In any case, ‘ the chief mo-

tives for shoplifting in the book
store appear to be the same as

those in the other local stores: ‘

thrill or just plain cheapness.
One boy gave the following rea-
son for stuffing a paper back
book he needed for a course into
his deep pocketed overcoat! “I
don’t know, I spent a lot on

6 Major Scene of Shoplifting in Book Center

“books already and I just didn't
feel like paying -for another
one.”

Like the other local stores,
the Book Center has no percen-
tage of its budget set apart to

"allow for shoplifting. And al-

though actual ﬁgures cannot be
known, an estimate of the
amount stolen can be made on
evidence and experience. People
like the boy who didn't feeflike
paying for one more book steal
from $40,000 to $60,000 a year
from the Pitt Book Center.
This seems like an incredible
ﬁgure‘ for a store that deals

largely in inexpensive articles.-

Yet it does not come close to
New York University’s book cen-
ter’s $75,000 or Yale's $90,000. In-
deed, statistics show that shop-
lifting is on the increase through-
out the country and the FBI
says rthatit is the fastest grow-
ing form of theft.

Although shoplifting may be
“in” throughout the country,
Langstaff states -that it is def-
initely on the decrease at Pitt.
He gives the security guards
and even the lower tuition as
possible "reasons for the de-
crease. The most encouraging
reason he gives‘, however, is that
he believes the students here'are
of a higher type of person than
that found in other areas.

Stores everywhere are suscep-
tile to shoplifters of every age
and intent. But when books are
stolen from the Pitt library,
there can be only one group ob-
viously guilty: Pitt students.

There is a problem of book
stealing throughout the entire
library, but the problem is more
serious in the reserve book room
on the sixth ﬂoor of the Cathe-
dral. At the end of last term,
159 books had not been account-
ed for. The reason for these
theﬂts is unique to this. Univer-
‘sity. _

On most campuses, reserve
books are formally checked out
for about two hours and used
in nearby study rooms. How-
ever, because of the limited
space here, the books are in
open stacks directly in the main

study room. A student can sim-
ply take a book from the shelves,

study »there -and nothing is to '

make him return the book if
he is inclinded to steal it. Like
the local stores, only the watch-
ful eye ‘of the employee, in this
case the librarian, is used as a
safeguard against thievery, Al-
though the problem exists for

any courses using the reserve A

room, /the social science courses
generally have the most trouble.
Dr. Hibbard U. B. Kline, chair-
man of the Geography Depart-
ment, feels that the principal
reason for stealing the reserved
books is that students are un-
der pressure and need more
time with an individual book.
Dr. Kline would rather lose
books of easy accessibility than '
hoard the books and not have

- them available to students.

Therefore, the only remedy that
he sees at this time is simply
more self discipline on the part
of the students.

In -September, !the problem
will probably decrease when the
new Hillman library comes into
use. There much of the more
essential material will be photo-
duplicated and the library will

have security guards at the _

doors. Carnegie Tech library is
now using guards to watch for

. stolen books.

We do steal. We, are in the
age group nationally recognized
as most apt to steal. But there“
is a great deal of evidence to
prove that we are no more sub-
ject to human failings than any-
one else just because we are
college students.

The following are quotes from
salesmen in four different lo-
cal stores: “Most college kids
have a sense of honor,” “We
have no more trouble with col-
lege kids than with any one
else,” “You can’ft really say it's
the college kids,” “College kids
seem to be pretty honest.” The
only conclusion to be stated is
that Pitt students are no less’
honest than any other group in
the population and may even
be more honest than students in
other universities.

by ALICE GOLDSMITH
The problem of cheating
is a crucial-one to the mid-
twentieth century society,
because it is a moral problem

which has no bounds. The '

academic question of cheat-
ing, cribbing, plagarizing and
fudging on exams and papers
is identified, but the every-
day cheating by the law-abiding
citizen is not.

Dr. Harvey M. Lacey, asso-
ciate professor of psychology,
feels that the average citizen
will cheat anything impersonal,
but will not -cheat or steal from
a friend or acquaintance.

Some forms of impersonal
cheating include deception in ﬁl-
ing income tax forms or acci-
dent insurance claims, insisting
that they inserted a nickel or
dime in the parking meter, tell-
ing the telephone company they
got a wrong number after mak-
ing a long distance phone call,
and even robbing a bank be-
cause the loss will hurt no one.

-Dr. Lacey feels people use these

gimmicks‘ because, “lit is not
costing anyone anything,” or be-
cause “Everyone\does it‘ and
why shouldn't I.” '

  

the major cause in‘ American
culture today is that there are
“no absolute values which dic-
tate right and wrong.” Youth to-
day have to determine their val-
ues for themselves,” and this, in
itself, causes many distinct and
dissimilar outlooks.

Dr. Lacey continued that the
moral values were diﬁerent 100
or even 50 years ago. “The com-
mandment ‘Thou shalt not . . .
was more rigid and puritanical
then."

“This decline in the absolut-
ism of religion caused social
shifts in the Western world
such as changing sexual values
and mores, the emphasis on get-
ting high grades rather than a
liberal education, the introduc-
tion of the ‘God is Dead’ philo-
sophy, and the ignoring of the
Ten Commandments and the six
Church Laws.

“The new scope of cheating is,
therefore, relativistic. ‘The ques-
tion of how theories apply to
the individual and to the situa-
tion’ is more important than the
crime which’was committed.”

Because this self-evaluating
process is ' so poignant, “Guilt
does not exist as it used to. The

‘fear of getting caught”. is a =
greater inﬂuence in reducing.

Cheating Problem Reviewed

Ironically, cheating is no long-
er viewed as a moral offense,
but is judged as to degrees of-
cheating. Stealing a large
amount is considered a greater
crime than stealing a little. By
the same token, a person caught
cheating on one question is not
expected to be judged as severe-
ly as the person caught cheat-

ing on many questions. But, has .
not a crime been committed in?“

both instances?
This pessimistic belief results
in Dr. Lacey's theory that, “A

good per cent of the people who I

do not cheat, would cheat, if.
they were given the opportun-
ity. “Because cheating and crime
are becoming institutions in the.
American culture, precautionary
measures must be taken.
Nevertheless, Dr. Lacey be-
lieves the way to correct this

situation is to give people more 

responsibility. He fosters the
idea that the superego will dic-
tate the “right” decision under
an honor system, because the
individual wants to prove him-
self responsive when trusted.

In this manner he assumes

-that an Honor Code would work

at Pitt, because‘ the student
would be trusted and treated as
a_ respected individual,‘ rather‘
than handled as "a-~ misbehavin

The Religious Scene

Chaplains Break From Dogma Approach 

by HOBART HARRIS

The professional religious es-
tablishment has always been the
traditional bearer of the moral
ﬂame. The men who are priests,
rabbis, or ministers, have con-
tinually felt the need to advise
and sometimes to pronounce up-
on moral questions. They have
spoken with the authority of
their Churches and their theo-
logy. Within their world and
their «positions, they were se-
cure.

But whether this can be said
of men who as Chaplains at the
University is another matter. In
a group such as ours, many are
for the -ﬁrst ti-me escaping the
envelope of earlier learned dog-
ma. This creates certain prob
lems of emphasis and belief that
have'_had a profound effect upon
three of the University's chap-
lains, Dr. Carl Stromee of the
First Baptist Church on Belle-
ﬁeld Ave., Rabbi Richard Ruben-
stein, and Father Christopher
Kennedy of the Pittsburgh Ora-
tory.

Where before we were offered
more religious form than sub-
stance and more sanctions in
the path of disbelief, college life
permits many of us to question
once-accepted beliefs, to be here-
tics and fear nothing but our
own consciences and our friends.
And as the religious facts of
our lives are being questioned,
so are our moral beliefs.

It is this double questioning
of values that has put the cam-
pus chaplains in the position
they are in. One of their most
important functions in counsel-
ing, when students come_ to them
with problems, often moral, and
request advice. It used to be
that the chaplain could appeal
to dogma, but that is up to ques-
tion. And when the students
came with questions of belief, it
used to be that the counselor
could appeal to the moral im-
plictions of disbelief. But this
avenue too is now at least part-
ly closed, because it is, in a very
real sense, part of the problem.

Each of the three men, in his
own way, and with the general
orientations of his religion, re-
‘ﬂected upon this problem.
“Whether people seeking help

' come to me or not depends upon

their expectation of me and
their general impression of my
beliefs,” Rabbi Rubenstein said.

Dr. "Stromee gave the. same
idea of the student’s condition-
a] acceptance of religious ad-
vice. “Many of the students feel
religion is of marginal interest
or total irrelevance,” he said.
“Many of them don’t come be-
cause they are afraid of the old
answers. They don’t realize that
the Church changes too.”

In a certain sense, the critical
aspect of many of the students
who come into contact with the
chaplains seem to have forced
them. to “play to the crow .”
Nothing seemed to have home
this out better than their re-
sponse to the initial question of
“What do ‘you think of morality
on Campus?” Both Rabbi Ru-
benstein and Father Kennedy
answered initially within the
framework of sex.

Rabbi Rubenstein observed
that “I suspect that there is
more freedom of sexual activity
than when I was in college. . . .
But while‘ ‘students have more
freedom, they are considerably
more confused, they need guide-
lines. But in a highly mobile so-
ciety, guidelines are hard to ar-
rive a .” ' ’

Rabbi“ Rubenstein .was pri- I
' ‘   

lem of freedom. “You pay a
price for everything,” he said.
“The concepts of good and evil
are not sufficient. Sexual rela-
tionships are not good or bad,
but infantile or mature. The
most fundamental insight of Ju-
daism is that the family and
the marital relationship is pri-
mary. I don’t think there is any
substitute for a really satisfy-
ing sexual relationship, but not
outside of marriage.

But just as Rubenstein em-
phasized his belief in marriage,

.he admitted that the problem
is not all that simple. “The prob-
lem is that college students are
biologicaﬂy prepared for a sex-
ual cormnittment before they
are vocationally.” He went on
to say that he did not think that
sexual relationships at this time
of life are wrong, but like every.
thing else," should be entered
into with a maximum of matur-
ity. “The deepest emotional in-
volvement is the best,” he said.

All three men said that they
spent much of their time coun-
seling students who came -to
them for guidance. Dr. Stromee
and Rabbi Rubenstein looked
upon this as an important as-
pect of their tasks, and empha-
sized the inerconnections be-

" tween the student’s lives, their

emotions, and their attitude to-
ward their religions. “There is

 -31°-ml!  the - to

of the secular and the pro-
fane,” Dr. Stomee said. How-
ever, they did not view this as-
pect of their ministries to be the
easiest. “You do have an inﬂu-
ence upon people whose interest
in the Chuch is quite high,” Dr.
Stromee said, “but most people
do‘ not recognize‘ your authority
immediately. You" have to win
their respect.”

Rubenstein and Stromee look
upon their theological heritage
as a mixed blessing. “Many of
the people who come here with

a strong religious background
as you have a true answer for

every problem,” he said. Ruben-V

stein referred to essentially the
same problem. “Theology is not

important to the people who
come to me unless they want to
be told what to do,” he said.

While they did not feel that
formal theology itself was an
assistance to their roles as coun-
selors, they still felt that there
was an indeﬁnable residue of
emotionality that they could ap-
peal to through their positions
as religious leaders. “The Church
man does have some resources
that secular counselors cannot
call on,” Dr. Stromee said.

Father Kennedy took a some-
what different view of the inter-
relationship between religion
and the secular world, and his

it

responsibility to the‘ two. “I am
leery of confusing guidance with
ministry,” he said. “Many of the
people who come to me are
more in need of psychotherapy
than religion.”

He felt that, to a certain ex-
tent, emotional problems of some

of the students couldn’t——and
shouldn’t—Jbe his realm of con-
cern. “My experience is that the

religious counselor dealing in

deep emotional problems is han-
dicapped,” he said. “Real reli-
gion does presume a certain
sanity or stability-—if a person
is unbalanced he can't be cap-
able of a full religious experi-
ence.”

Thisview of the isolation of
religion from other aspects of
life found expression through-
out Father Kennedy's thought.
He prefers to limit his ministry
primarily to purely religious
functions. “I don’t think social
youth organization is our busi-
ness. I didn’t study theology to
study dances. It’s a question of
what's necessary.”

Dr. Stromee was the most
overtly concerned with the
changing moral standards on
campus of the three. “People
are trying to discover what it is
to be a real human being. We no
longer have the feeling of pur-

' pose we had When physical sur-

vival was a serious concern,” he
said. The result of this is that
“old myths are being greatly
questioned” as the nexus of peo-
ple’s moral concern changes.
“We’ve all been inﬂuenced by
cotexual ethics,” according to
Stromee. This is the reason why
so many students feel that the
Church is “irrelevant.”
Perhaps the most striking as-
pect of Dr. Stromee’s and Rab-
bi Rubenstein’s opinions is the
impression that the students
seem to be having as much ef-

~../

fect upon their religious lead- ,_

ers views on morality as their '

leaders have on them.

There seems to be a struggle
between their roles as the pur-
veyors of established dogma and
the interpreters of the student’s
real lives. Each, rather than try-
ing to enforce the letter of the
law, seems to instill’ in the stu-
dents the spirit of the law, and
then hope for the best. They
understand their special posi-
tion as religious advisers, but
at the same time feel it neces-

sary to deny any “holy” signi- ’

ﬁcance of their words. They are
wary of being branded unfeel-
ing, as many of their contem-
poraries are who are more in-
terested in dogma than happi-
ness.

In short, they seem ‘to be old-
er, wiser, and more mature men
who have_ seen much more of
the world than we ‘have, but
sometimes ﬁnd it just as hard
to be sure they’re right, or to
use their own positions to help
the rest of us. They seem to be
in a double bind where they
must deny much of the old
dogma for fear of sounding ri-
diculous or dictatorial, yet, with
each shedding they ﬁnd they

have less and less of the very --
special signiﬁcance that theo- ’

logical justiﬁcation could add to
their message. On one hand
there is the danger of seeming
ridiculous, on the other, irrele-
vant.

 -—-‘—— The True Story —‘—‘——‘‘''I
Troubled IM Sports

Lack Organization
By George Lies

Associate Sports Editor 

*2 (This is the second of two articles written to analyze the"

{ organization of the U niversitg/’s Intramural Sports program.)

The intramural sports program is in a slum condition.

, It’s becorne rundown. At times, it has brought a confusion

‘ ;f ‘:1 which breeds lack of-interest. But why?

On the outside, the system lacksappeal. And on the
inside,- the system has failed to lick its major problems.

Organization heads the agenda. Every September, ath-
letic chairmen from each‘ competitive group, whether it be
a fraternity or a dormitory team, sit down to discuss the
sports schedule for the coming year. But why start to or-
ganize so late. Avoid this.

Draw up a schedule before the new school year, either
during the summer months or before school ends in April.
Then when the fall comes, begin play in the ﬁrst full week
of school.

THE LEADERS‘.are another vital part of this organiza-
tion. Presently, the IM guidelines are established by a
faculty administered policy. At the head is Leo C. Bemis,
assisted by two graduate assistants. Next in the order of_
command, come the res_pective league representatives. ’

,_  But throughout this setup, there is a lack of communi-

-’./ cation. And it continues down the ladder to the individual

teams. Should there be another setup?

Previously, the IM department tried a student ma.nage-
ment system. It was headed by one senior manager. To as-
sist him, there were two to four junior and four to seven
sophomore managers. According to Bemis, however, this
particular operation “phased out with the coming of the tri-
mester.”

Officiating, a second problem, is nationwide. In the
past. there used to be a Pitt Officials Association. Referees
were paid. They were rated and evaluated.

 “We’ve tried everything,” Bemis pointed out. “We’ve
, asked for one team representative to go into a pool. But we
“ ; can’t teach them. We should have a clinic so they can learn,
but there isn’t enough time.”

.- «"' AN IM HANDBOOK, an invaluable item, isneeded to
outline both the organization of sports and the “chain of
command.” But for the pas.t two years, there hasn’t been
one.
With all of the disputes over rule violations, eligibility

requirements, forfeits, and postponements, there is no rea-

son for not having one. Its by-laws would govern all IlVI

sports. It could recognize the champions from previous

years and maintain a.n updated “record book.”
The fourth problem, and What may be the key to the

licity. -

TO CREATE INTEREST, a point system is now in use
xto give teams a goal. Also, in each sport, teams can, win
'/./trophies. But that’s it. The‘re’s an All Sports trophy, but

the teams far in arrears in the point standings quit compet-
ing at season's end. The IM program no longer offers any-
thing for them. ‘

But what if All Star teams were selected and recogni-

tion was given to a participant who broke a swimming or ‘a
track record, would these teams quit? They’d probably
‘N compete right up until the scheduled date of the IM Ath-
 letic Awards Banquet. No, there isn’t a banquet now, but
just think what a boost it would be to the sports program.
Of course, IM sports are not dying.-But why go through
a season like a blindman feeling his way along. Organize
beforehand. Then just try to keep those athletes away.

Hart Bypasses Bad Weather

Dave Hart probably of-

fended some evil spirit when

he accepted the coaching job
here a little more than a year
ago. Last spring’s Weather

conﬁned his football team to fre- -

quent sneaker and sweatsuit
practices in Trees, Hall.’ This
spring practice has begun the
same way.

“The weather's even worse,”

Hart commemted. 'l".he gridders.

were two weeks late in starting
because of snow; their ﬁrst full-

scale scrimmage was played 20° ’

temperatures on a ﬁeld that was
icy and muddy at the same
time; and this Week, rain has
forced them back into Trees
Hall.

“We can't hit when we're in-
doors,” said Hart. “That's the
big disadvantage.” Other prob-
lems for the ballplayers include
the traction of tennis shoes vs.
cleats and the confusing echoes
inside the gym.

Because of the slow start,

Junior Track Star Paul Greig

\ A ‘good distance runner

scholarship offers from small
schools but chose Pitt with lit-
tle regard for his running fu-
ture.’ The University had the
size and the metalurgical engi-
neering department that he
wanted, with the athletic facil-
ities only a second considera-
tion.

It was not until his sopho-
more year that Greig did pick
up an athletic scholarship here.
When Jim Banner became head
track coach, he increased Greig’s
scholarship more on hope for
future success than on past pe_r-
formance,

Greig was dissatisﬁed for his
ﬁrst two years, and it showed
in his running. He was consider-
ing giving up the sport until
Banner took .,over. The junior

presents a kind of paradox.
‘ He is realistic and idealistic

 and in collegiate running ex-

;,}Li<ves Paradox of Distance Man  

distance man feels that Banner’s
coaching helped him regain the
conditioning he had lost since
high school and led him to his
most successful year.

b Against Army, Greig broke a
28 year old outdoor record for
the two mile run. Set-‘ting an
outdoor mark indoors is an al-
most, unheard of accomplish-
ment; Yet this is not the great-
.est thrill Greig has had in track.

“My main overall thrill has
been my improvement over last
year,” he said. Greig’s two mile
time came down almost a full
minute. This and, “doing some-
thing that will make people real-
ize that we're accomplishing
things up here,” have been his
most signiﬁcant. achievements.

. ., Stev¢..D¢91¥.-,

Hart feels that ‘the practices are
behind those of last year, but
“there’s no question we're ahead

as a squad, both in numbers and

ability.

“I told the squad before prac-
tice today,” he added, “that there
are 22 positions on the team.
Whoever wants to play, just has
to block and tackle and there’ll
‘be a place for him.”

For Hart and his assistants,
their primary purpose during
these sessions is to give every-
one a look at every possible
position. “Our biggest job,” ac-
cording to Hart, “is to place
these people in the right spots.

“We as coaches can’t allow
ourselves to get carried away in ,
the spring,” he continued. “We
can’t be concerned about how
fancy we can get by teaching
intricate offenses and defenses.
Instead we should give every
player a chance both ways.”

Hart is particularly concern-
ed with the younger boys on the
squad. “We have to give the
sophomores a chance to be look-
ed at _/“thoroughly. ’

“I made myself a promise be-
fore practice started that we

been able to get outside since then because of
bad weather, as they enter their second week of
spring practice.

would have four days for of-
fense and four days devoted to
defense. Today was the day for
swapping the players,” and Hart
smiled.

“The assistant coaches were
reluctant to let some of their
boys go,” he revealed. “They
want them for certain positions.
They tell me how perfectly suit-
ed the players are. But now I

ﬁnd out that in some cases the

offensive and defensive coaches

‘say the same things about the

same boy. So we have to ﬁnd
the right position in each case
that most beneﬁt the team.”

Certain players, however, are
set. Bob Bazylak is running ﬁrst
team quarterback; Bob Longo
will stay at split end; Joe Jones
and Mike Raklewicz remain in
the offensive backﬁeld.

On defense, Joe Curtin and
Paul Killian are established in
the secondary and other letter-
men, such as Dave Drake, are
ﬁxed front.

But the sophomores are Hart's
key to success and his job now
is to place them in the right
slots.

Powerful ‘Twenties’ Team,

Captures Dorm Swim Meet

With mainly pride as their motivating factor since
Sutherland House has already won the dorm all-sports tro-
phy, the Roaring Twenties completely dominated the final

scheduled intramural sport,
swimming. The 20’s easily out
distanced second place Suther-
land and third place House of
Lords by Winning ﬁve out of
seven events. ..
The individuals who paced
the 20’s were Bob Bolton and
Charley Frebel. While Bolton
was Winning the 50-yard free-
style with an impressive time
of 26.0 seconds, Frebel captured
three titles: the 75-yard individ-
ual medley, the 50-yard back-
stroke, and the one meter dive.
Sutherland’s strong relay team
of Jim Painster, Chuck Mross,
.and.,_Stere...S91n°ki._

       

 

broke the 20’s Winning formula
by taking the 100-yard medley

relay. The 20’s came back to

winvthe ﬁnal event, the 200-yard
relay, with a team of John
Stentz, Bolton, Bob Greenberg,
and Norm Kostruain.

DORM BOWLING
Those dorm houses who
would like to participate in

.have at least three men to be
able to compete. Hirschﬁeld

Tennis Team Confident of Winning Season

by JERRY GRUEBEL

With the opening tennis
matches against West V11‘-
ginia just two weeks away
coach Ben Pope is confident
of an improved season. Pope
ca.1ls this year’s team, “the most
balanced squad that we’ve had
in ﬁve years.

Four of the six starters are
back from last year’s 3-8 squad;
juniors Bill Nicholas and Bill
Goldstein and seniors Eric Lie-
berman and Marty Liebowitz.
The other two starting spots
will be ﬁlled by junior George
Berry, who attended Greens-
burg the past two years, and
Bob Salembier, another talented
junior." Stephen Talnage will
probably be Pope's only reserve.

Nichols ‘will be the number
one man on the team again.
Berry played against Nichols in
high school and beat him, but
Berry says that his teammate
is so improved that he doesn't
think he could beat him again.

Nichols ﬁnished 5-6 overall in
the singles last year and 8-3 in
the doubles. His partner was

Lieberman for most of the sea-
son.

As of now, Goldstein and Lie-
berman are competing for the
number two spot on the team.
The rankings in the other three
spots are also up for grabs. “I
wouldn't be surprised if the bot-
tom three played as well as the
top three,” claims Pope.

Coach Pope has other less
welcomed problems. Oneof them
is the weather. The team has
not yet been able to practice
outdoors yet. They have had to
settle for the squash courts in
the Field House instead of their
new regulation courts outside.

Another problem is getting
ready for the opening match,
April 3, at West Virginia.

“They’re a great team. Their
boys play with a. lot of guts,”
says Pope.

‘The coach also expects a tough
match with Bucknell on April
8. He attributes their power to
the 21 courts that the school

oﬁers to its students. “They
have so many players to pick
from,” he points out.

When asked to predict the
fate of his team, Pope answers,
“Modestly, we should at least
break even.”

by MIKE BROURMAN

There’s only one Astro-E
dome, but baseball coach-

Bobby Lewis is busy trying
to create another one out of
the‘Fie1d House.

The opening pitch of the sea-
son is only -two weeks away,
but bad weather has kept the
mitters fromgetting a chance
to workout on a real ﬁeld. So,
using basketball courts for his
inﬁeld, the track for an outﬁeld,
and an area behind the stands
as a batting cage, Lewis trying
to simulate game conditions for
his players.

It’s quite a task, as Lewis is
the first to admit. “There’s —no
substitute for being outside.
There are certain things you
can't do indoors. But We try to
simulate game conditions as best
we can.”

An escalation of sorts in Lew-
is’ war with the weather occur-
red last Saturday when the mit-
ters held their ﬁrst batting drill
under “simulated game situa-
tions.” '

“We tried to make it as-real- A

istic as possible,” explains Lew-
is, “by using pitchers instead of

. pitching machine. They mixed

up the pitches, and the hitters

" got practice in anticipating the _
curves and seeing offspeed pitch- ~
es. The machine throws only .

fastballs.”
The work out was a condition-
al success, according to Lewis.

“I think they’re coming along
pretty good but still it’s pretty
hard to tell indoors. ‘

“I think they all got a pretty
good workout. At least they got
some wood on the ball. The
pitchers got some work too, but
it was pretty hard for -them to
work without a, mound and with-
out spikes.”

It seems that a mound is
about the only thing Lewis has
