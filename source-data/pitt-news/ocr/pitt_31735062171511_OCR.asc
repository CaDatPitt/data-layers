Possibilities for sweeping
changes in Student Govern-
ment begin Monday when vot-
ing on the proposed Constitu-
tion will begin. Voting is
scheduled for Monday and
Wednesday in the SU Ballroom
and on Tuesday in the Towers
Lobby.

The new document which rep
resents two years of effort. fea-
tures a four person executive with
each person in charge of one
of the areas of Activities l’ro-
gramming. Acadeiinics. and scr-
vices. _

KLAVONICLAUDS PLAN

Lenny Klavonic, SG Presi-
dent, said of the new constitu-
tion, “I feel that by replacing
the one-man presidency with

four people responsible for dif-
ferent areas, you’re making the
executive much more responsible
to student needs and much better
able to handle what the students
want.”

Though Klavonic and most
of the present SG are very much
in favor of the work. opposing
opinions have also been cast. .A
leaflet has been circulated around
campus. and mailed to some coin-
muters. charging “the Student
(iovernment gang" with attempt-
ing a power play.

Coolie 'ative Ventures

by BOB BONN

The City College Congress of
Pittsburgh tC(‘CPi. previously
billed as a group which would
sponsor several exciting new
programs. has begun to live up
to its expectations.

The group. consisting of all
SG presidents and the chancel-
lors of Carlow. Duquesne. Pitt.
Chatham. Point Park. ‘(‘-.\II'.
and Robert Morris. met Wednes-
day and discussed the follow-
ingissues:

COMMUTEB PROBLEMS

In an attempt to get some
action. the Commuter Association
of each college will do an inves-
tigative surve_v of the travel
times of commuters on its cam-
pus. Computers will be used to
surve_v the heaviest traffic times
in Pittsburgh.

Then, armed with this infor-
mation, the CCCP will approach
PAT and the county commis-
sioners with a joint proposal
seeking reduced rates for stu-
dents travelling during the
non-peak traffic hours.

The statement to be pre-
sented would be signed by all
the presidents or chancellors
of the various colleges as well
as by the SG presidents. This
would. in the words of Pitt's S(;
President Lenny Klavonic. "pro-
vide a united college front in
the city."

TELEVISION

A proposal by Klavonic will
provide for the implementation
of a closed circuit television

network to all college campuses
in the city. to be developed by
Bell Laboratories.

l\'lavoni‘c explained that this
would enable the televising the
major lectures of popular courses
such as (‘AS 14 «Seminar on
l)rugs> or the new course on
.\'on-\'erbal (‘ommunication to
all campuses.

"Although being closed with
registration." Klavonic said. "it
could be televised to students not
in the classroom.“

Added the student leader, “Ma-
jor speakers wouldn’t be limit-
ed to just the available facility,
as well as news, important in-
formation, and special programs
of interest to students.

This proposal received the
unanimous consensus of the
presidents. An intensive survey
to study the necessary re-
quisites for the system will
begin shortly. and the project
will be submitted for federal
funding early in 1971.

CROSS-REGISTRATION

Since Pitt is affiliated with

the Pittsburgh Council of High-

'er Education. students will be
able to participate in an expand-
ed cross—registration program.

Open to sophomores, juniors,
and seniors, students may now
register for one course per term
at any other institution, that is,
one each at any of the other
participating colleges.

disadvantage under the restruc-

However, a joint announcement
signed by the presidents of these
three groups denied that they
had ever taken such a stand, and
advocated that students learn what
was proposed in the constitution
and then vote according to their
own consciences.

Following are some of the high-
lights of the constitution.

problems without abandoning their lighthearted manner.

by STEVE LUBETSKY

Commuters were given the
opportunity to voice their griev-
ances Wednesday. but response
was mild.

“Among the topics discussed
at the seminar held in the Stu-
dent Cnion Ballroom were pub-
lic transportation. parking facil-
ities. commuting athletes. and a
commuter lounge in the Stu-
dentl7nion.

Jim Bender. Director of Cus-
tomers Services at Port Autlior-
ity Transit tPATi. spoke for the
mass transit system.

He confirmed that PAT is
developing an Early Action Pro-
gram as a more efficient means
of transportation. Bender ex-
plained that under the new sys-
tem, PAT buses will have “exclu-
sive roadways” which will alle-
viate traffic congestion. “A PAT
bus will carry as many passen-
gers as 35 cars,” he said.

The cost of the project. ac-
cording to Bender. is estimated
at $228 million. The federal gov-
ernment will provide two—thirds

of the needed funds. while the
balance will be paid by the
Country.

The plan. according to Ben-

der. was approved in June and
will take 5‘: years to complete.
The PAT representative revealed

.that "fthe engineering has been

started. "

ules. He said that fares were rais-
ed only once in the last six years.
which was a hike of five cents.
“The reason that rates are so
expensive." explained Mr. Ben-

der. “is that somebody has to.

pay for drivers" salaries. The state
and the county pay for the facil-
ities only. Wages must be com-
pensated for by passengers.

"Senior citizens and high
school students." he contin-
ued. "ride less expensively.

since the reduced rates are made
up for by the county.“

Bender explained that finances
are the reasons that buses run
so infrequently at night, only
once an hour. “If they followed
regular schedules as in the day,
costs would be fantastic. This is
because we would have to pay
drivers time and a half for over-
time.”

Commuters Discuss Woes

(Continued from Page 1)
Athletic Department will do
everything possible to make
facilities available to commuting
students. We are concerned about

commuters and want expanded
physical activity for the non-
inter-collegiate sports enthusiast.”
STUDENT UNION EXTENSION

Hunt Martin. Director of the
Physical Plant. revealed that a
capital budget has been made
for finances to pay for construc-
tion of a new section of the Student
Union and for revnovating the ex-
isting one.

Martin explained that the pur-
pose of the new structure is in
the process being defined, and its
final approval rests with the
Project Manager of the Student
Advisory Board. "The tenta-
tive plans include food services.
recreation. lecture. meeting and
conference rooms. and a com-
muter lounge. but that is sub-
ject to change. depending on
the discretion of the Project
Manager.“

The cost of the project will
amount to $6.875.000. he said.
Since part of the services offer-
ed constitute an "auxiliary enter-
prise." such as food. which is
self supporting. the University
will pay part of the costs of

building. "This is because the
University will be reimbursed
through profits."

The construction. according
to Martin. will occur in two
phases.

Phase one will be the con-
struction of the new section.
while phase two will be geared
for renovating the present facil-
ity.

"These plans will allow us to
maintain services while we are
building." Martin remarked.
"When the new section is com-
pleted. we would move into it
and renovate the building now
in use."

He cautioned, however, that
no action can be taken unless
the new Legislature appropriates
funds. “If an appropriations
bill is passed, it would probably
be in late 1971 or early 1972. It
is possible, though, that capital
items no longer meet" with ap-
proval.”

DISCUSSES PARKING

Martin also touched briefly
on parking conditions.

“The University recognizes
the problem." he noted. “and it
has been active in conferences
and parking studies."

He continued that "these
studies have shown that there
is a deficit in parking facilities.
and have concluded that the best

The University of Pittsburgh's
Camerata Singers, directed by
Don Franklin, will perform at
8:30 p.m., Tuesday in Heinz
Memorial Chapel.

The concert, sponsored by
Pitt's Music Department, is open
to the public without charge.

A student group, the Cam-
erata Singers was organized
last year to perform chamber
and dramatic works of the Ren-
aissance and Baroque periods.

facilities are conveniently lo-
cated spacious parking garages. ”
Martin maintained, however,

that parking facilities alone are
not the issue because “an addi-
tional parking space

contributes to traffic congestion.

"Parking ties in with the other
problems of the road network
and the mass transit system."
Martin asserted.

He suggested that the best
solution is a less expensive and
more rapid system of mass tran-
sit so that “people will weigh
the advantages between driving
a car and using public transpor-
tation."

Commenting on the success of ‘

the seminar. Paul Hensler. Presi-

_dent of the Commuter Associa-

tion. said that -“although the par-
ticipation was low. a few people
are interested. and perhaps they
picked up some ideas that will
lead to a solution."

ln this concert, the Singerl.
will be joined by guest artists
Mary Ann Doody, soprano, and
John Klingensmith, tenor, in the
performance of Schuetz’ “Mag-
nificat,” Haydn’s “Salve Regi-
na," and Carrissimi"s “Jepthe,”
an oratorio.

Don Franklin, the director, is
a specialist in the performance
of Baroque music. Before com-
ing to Pitt as assistant professor
of music, Dr. Franklin taught
at San Francisco State College.

Blacks Jive At Talent Show

by NANCY RUTHER

The Black Talent Show. or-
ganized by the Black Action
Society (BAS). highlighted the
second day of the first annual
Black Week at Pitt.

Tuesdays agenda included
a coffee hour in the BAS office
from 7 to 8 PM and. immediate-
ly afterward. the Talent Show in
Lawrence Hall.

Announcer Ed Smith intro-
duced the production by saying.
“Talent night is put together by
everybody — it‘s for you and it‘s
all you. If it's jive. then you're
jive. If it's fine. then so are you."

People arrived sporadically
between 8 and 9 to flashing spot-
lights and music ranging from
African through jazz to rock. At
about 9:30. the auditorium was
fairly full and the show began.
The emcee attributed the late
start to the audience. “It‘s going
to start a little late because peo-
ple are arriving on CP time -
That's Colored People time."

The Entertainers. a four-piece
local band contracted for the
evening, performed two numbers
to start things. During the second.

men in shocking-blue jumpsuits.
did a dance routine a-la Supremes.

Then, without a pause in the

‘ applause, John Mitchell. Charlie

Organ and George Gray took the
stage to sing “Old Man River."
Their voices — bass. tenor and
falsetto — combined a capella
and the audience responded en-
thusiastically. But the clapping
grew louder when Mr. Smith an-
nounced the next song as. “Ohh
Baby. Baby." «

The Alpha Kappa Alpha sisters
switched the mood to slavery
with a female soloist singing the
spiritual, “Wade in the Water."
The sorority sisters came down
the aisles in slave garb. complete
with chairs. Huddled on the stage.

the_y read quotes from Jefferson
and Lincoln promising freedom.

Then following. the historic
progression of Afro—Americans.
they quoted Frederick Douglass.
"Better to die free than live
slave." Moving quickly through
the "Separate but equal“ period.
the spokeswoman expressed
blackness today. As they all rose
and defiantly broke the chanis.
she shouted. "Freedom is mine
——Dream of freedom!"

The fraternity brothers of
Kappa Alpha Psi then formed
a U-shape on the floor in front
of the stage. They sang‘ three
fraternity themes. locking arms
for the last. In response to the
paltry applause. the MC quipped.
“For you who are down on fra-
ternities. well. just remember
there ain't nothing Greek about
being Black.“

A wailing voice singing a Blues
song cut short the announcer.
and the Delta Sigma Theta pre-
sentation began. In a musical
progression from early slavery.
they arrived at Martin Luther
Kings famous" speech. "I have
ADream."

Then, a shrill voice screamed.
"King is Dead!" and everyone
stood to sing the Black Na-
tional Anthem. One of the sisters
then exhorted the audience with.
“Be proud of your thick lips and
black skin.“

Following the theme of black
pride. the troupe brought up
Malcolm X. To explain the Black
sentiment at the time of his
death. one of -the sisters did
an interpretive dance which
was received extremely well
as evidenced by the applause
and shouts of “Teach!" and
"Exp ess yourself. you beautiful
Black queen! “

The girls maintained the fever
pitch through a series of speeches
and into a song with a soloist sing-
ing. “We are proud." and the
chorus responding with. “Say it
louder." As the Delta sisters left
the stage. they circulated through
the audience encouraging people
to dance with them.

A much younger and serious
group came to the people next.

  

Five students from the Libera-
tion School Players portrayed
the life. death and spirit of Mal-
colm X. On the edge of their
applause. a man in a dashiki
read the poem of Negro rebellion.
"Nigger Night". to the beat of
the six Congo drums.

Sisters Juanita and Namosha
presented a series of sketches
portraying various aspects of the
Black Experience and their re-
lationships to Black Pride. Sister
Namosha. as a scrubwoman.
gave a brief soliloquy of her tri-
als and then realizing her beauty
as a black woman shouted. “I
too am America!". and hurled
her mop into the audience.

Sister Juanita at one point
stated. "If I can teach Black
pride. it will be recorded for
the second time — make note-
the second time. that man has
discovered fire."

In a plug for the very famous
author-poet. Leroi Jones. two
Black brothers spoke for the
Committee for a Unified Newark.
They shouted to the people. “What
time is it?“ and the people res-
ponded. "Nation time."

Concluding the program and
furthering the theme of Black
Pride. Sister Rohmana A1i)Sandy
Thomas) performed an interpre-
tive dance to the Congo drummers
beat. After this very Black pet'-

formance. Rochelle Thomas sang '

the "Look of Love" and "This
Time We Almost Made It."
This slowed the tempo and only
a handfull of the previous crowd

he desired. “There probably

On Sunday evening, November
15 from 7:30 until 10 o'clock the
Carnegie library will hold a
“Happy 75th Birthday Party" at
the Oakland Branch. The Library
would like everyone in Pitts-
burgh and the surrounding com-
munities to help share in the
birthday festivities.

Refreshments will be served
including a giant-sized birth-
day cake complete with all
birthday party items. Scattered
throughout various parts of
the Library will be entertain-
ment groups plus exhibits that
feature the Library's services to
the community. For children
there will be party hats, bal-

together with souvenirs for ev-

The Student Health Services
Committee of Student Govern-
ment is sponsoring a 5-Day-Kick
the Habit Program. The group
will meet five consecutive eve-
nings from 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m.
from November 16 thru 20.
This program is open to 100
participants—students, faculty
and staff. The only prerequisite
is a sincere interest in quitting
cigarettes.

Sign-up and preliminary in-
structions are available at the
Student Health Service recep-
tion desk, 204 Brackenridge
Hall, Ext. 518.

CONCERTS

A problem with
concerts now is the limited funds
and limited attendance at the
individual colleges. An example
of this would be the experiment
with the Concert-A—Month pro-
gram here.

SG's Director of Student Ac-
tivities. Frank Bilotta, recently
stated that Pitt had lost the
Fifth Dimension for Winter
Weekend because they had turn-
ed down the University's offer
of $15.000. which was the high-
est sum ever offered to any group
to perform at Pitt. -

“By combining with other Uni-
versities,” Klavonic said, “we
can not only raise the amount
of money we can offer, but also
can provide enough students to
insure a sellout.

“Hence. we‘ll be able to bring"
in groups like Crosby, Stills,
Nash, and Young, The Who, The
Jackson Five, or the Moody
Blues. If the students at the
Universities want to attract $25,-
000 groups. then joining together
with funding and ticket sales
would enable top-grade enter-

tainment to appear at Pittsburgh

institutions."

, Chairman, Political Science Department
This account reports on an inventory of Pitt Political Science

V “student participation during the fall political campaign and es-

pecially during the “election recess.” All students in attendance
for eight political science classes on Wednesday, November 4,
were asked to supply information on their political participa-
tion in the 1970 campaign. Altogether, 286 students filled out
questionnaires. The following table reports the central findings.

IV: ‘Some Data to Remember:
1. Over 3/4 of the students in this Pitt sample took no part

 in the fall campaign.

2. Eight-two percent of the total sample did not “campaign"

V during the “election recess.” Only seven per cent of the total

sample did some work on both days.
V 3. About one-half of the‘ activists worked fewer than 25 hours

V during the entire fall campaign’

V. Some Miscellaneous Conclusions:
1. The election recess, frankly, was a bust.

2. These figures probably exaggerate student involvement in
politics, since the sample was drawn entirely from political sci-
ence classes and presumably represents the student clientele most

‘ likely to participate in politics.

rm

3. There is not a vagrant wisp of evidence in these data
which suggests that the election recess should be continued in fu-

V ‘V .f: ture years as a general university policy.

llf Leaflet Blasting 86 Constitution

(Editor's Note: During the
past several weeks, an anony-
mous federation of students has
undertaken a mail and leaflet
campaign to discredit the new
Student Government A Constitu-
tion. The unsigned statement
termed the proposed structure
a “four-man dictatorship” and
accused tlie “SG gang of try-
ing to pull a fast one on the
students.

The printed material went
on to claim that: '‘If the pro-
posed Student Government
Constitution is passed, all real
power over student affairs will
be taken from the students and

handed over to a four man
quaumvirate (sic). The stu-
den ts as a whole will lose

their rights and their power.
Campus organizarions like

the Commuter Association,

Associated Women Students
and the lnter-Fraternity Coun-
cil and their memberships will
lose their initiative in the run-
ning of their own affairs and
will have to bow and scrape
to the whims of a four-man
dictatorship. All phases of stu-
dent affairs will be under the
thumb of this four-man dic-
tatorship which will control

in response to the references
to their groups, the presidents
of the aforementioned organi-
zations have disassociated _
themselves from allegations and
written a joint reply according
to their perceptions of the docu-
ment. The following piece has
been co-signed by Paul Hens-
ler, Commuter Association,
Linda Oswald, Associated Wo-
men Students and Joe Wend-
ler, lnter-Fraternity Council.)

During the past week, sev-
eral mimeographed sheets have
been distributed which attempt
to discredit the Student Govern-

. ment Referendum on a new con-

stitution, as well as Student
Government and the Student
Government president.

Some of these irresponsible
statements claim that Asso-
ciated Women Students (AWS),
Commuter Association (CA),
and Interfraternity Council
(IFC) oppose the new consti-
tution.

These organizations have
taken no position on the new
constitution. Our only desire
is that the members of our or-
ganizations, as well as all un-
dergraduates, become familiar
with the new proposal, form

‘ be discredited

an educated opinion on it and
vote according to their con-
victions. AWS, CA and IFC
have not and will not take an
official stand on the constitu-
tion.

We would also like to state
that the new constitution is not
something which is being un-
derhandedly imposed upon the
student body by a xmall clique
of students. The constitution
was formulated by a bi-par—ti-
san group of students.

Open, and well publicized
but poorly attended hearings
were held on the constitution.
These hearings were the time

i to present objections and alter-

natives to the constitution.

The constitution should not

tions, false statements attribu-
ted to others, emotional appeals

formed of the situation and

ponsible that they do not sign

We ‘ask that members of our
organizations and all undergra-
duates ignore these statements,

seek to inform themselves of

the issues and vote.

When a person realizes the gravity of the
problem of overpopulation, he often asks what
to do about it. As an individual, the solution to
a major problem might involve more than one
person can do, but with overpopulation, the ef-
forts of each individual are most important.

Birth control is the first step. As each indi-

vidual realizes that family sizes must be limited
to only replace the parents (two children), each
person must take advantage of the many con-
traceptive devices available in order to ~limit
his own family.

Such contraceptive methods are the condom,
intrauterine devices, contraceptive jellies, foams,
or liquids. the diaphragm. birth control pills, and
the rhythm method.

Also available are operations to permanently*
prevent contraception: vasectomies for males
and tubal ligation for females.

These two methods are especially useful for
people who have already had the number of
children they want and do not wish the contin-
ual expense of contraceptives or the chance of
pregnancy.

Also, though the individual might not realize
it. education and political action can anable
our society to limit population.

If parents instruct their children in birth
control methods. and tell them the problems of

handling a large family. then future genera-g

tions will profit.

Whether or not students have
the right to participate in the
administration of their univer-
sity is a moot question. Not so
debatable. however. is the priv-
ilege of the student body to be
aware of the administrative pro-
cess of decision—making.

tee is Dr. John C. Cutler. Dis-
covering this valuable know-
ledge encompassed three phone
calls, which resulted in being

municado for three days straight

Telling friends about overpopulation may
help get them involved in controlling it. Self-
education is also important. Realizing why over-
population is bad economically, socially, and
psychologically will help the individual get
ideas about new methods ofpopulation control,
and help a person to teach others about the harm 2
of overpopulation.

Political action plays a role too. Telling sen-
ators and representatives, local or state, that
you want population control will help them
realize that action must be taken. Through le-
galization of abortion, many unwanted children
will not be born.

A new tax law that will in the future make
it unprofitable tax-wise for prospective parents
to have more than two children would also help
limit population growth.

This law would allow deductions for two
children only, other children being non-exempt.
This would apply only to children born after
a specified future date.

Finally, religious condemnation of birth con-
trol stagnates legal action while population in-
creases at dangerous rates.

Telling your minister or priest that you and
other parishioners feel that birth control should
be legalized by your church may help change
the ruling. ’

Many things are available for everyone to
do, but if you really want to get involved and

Friday November 13, 1970 THE PITT NEWS—-Pa e5 ’ _

Response: Letters to the Editor

Marx vs. Individlml Dirty Politics

The purpose of this letter is to
take Paul LeBlanc to task for his
comments which appeared in the
Oct. 26 edition of The Pitt News.

To start with. LeBlanc trump-
ets the claim that Marxists don’t
hold society higher than the in-
dividual, and that they believe in
the inherent value of the individ-
ual. In his sixth thesis on Feur—
bach. Marx himself said that

“The human essence is in no ab-
steaction inherent in each single in-
dividual. In its reality it is the en-
semble of the social relations.”

Throughout his writings Marx
disparaged the individual in favor
of the collective.

Now I can already hear the loy-
al socialists at Pitt screaming
that one small quote is not suffi-
cient evidence to indict Marxism
on this point. Well, let’s take an
overall look at the philosophy,
quoting from a study sponsored by

the Russian Institute of Columbia _

University, entitled Soviet Ethics
and Morality. According to this
SOllI'C€.

“The Soviet view of man differs
from many Western views in that
it is collectivist instead of individ-
ualist. Man as man appears only in
society. Apart from that society we
cannot speak of individual men.”

The book goes on to say that, un-
der Marxist-Leninist theory,

“We must not begin with an in-
dividual who merely expresses
himself in a society with other in-
dividuals, and who finds his true
self in some sense by himself, for
there is no such man.”

Of course, I must re-emphasize
that these quotes pertain not to
the so-called “half-finished" form
of present-day communism. but
to the perfect mortality which will
guide the future total Marxist
state.

I do not attribute the slave la-
bor camps of Russia, the Red
Guard rampages in China and the
political prisons in Cuba to a "pre-
revolutionary heritage. "

Instead, they must be recogniz-
ed as the inevitable result of the

Marxist philosophy which gov-
erns these nations.

For no matter how one looks at
the issue. Marxism is merely a
variant of collectivism. and no
type of collectivism acknowledges i
any inherent value in the individ-
ual.

As for the rationalization in
your letter. exactly what did you
mean when you used the term
“pre-revolutionary heritage" to
excuse the failure of practical

- Marxism? If one looks at a Com-

munist country. the USSR, for ex-
ample, the term makes no sense
at all. Did you mean the “pre-rev-
olutionary heritage” of the peo-
ple‘? If so. why hasn‘t the post-
revolutionary generation born
since 1917 and thoroughly indoc-
trinated with Marxism, created
the socialist Utopia?

Or perhaps you were referring.
to the leaders. Yet Brezhnev and
Kosygin, the first of the post-rev-
olutionary leaders, have not only
failed to relax the tyrany within
their own country, but had no
qualms about sending tanks into
Czechoslovakia.

No. your excuse just won't hold.
But even if it did, I‘d like to ask
you a final question: Should the
U.S. fall under a Marxist govern-
ment, wouldn‘t our “pre-revolu-
tionary heritage" of what you
would call “decadent capitalism“
insure a dictatorship for our so-
Clely? Barry E. Wright

In SC Vote

Editor. The Pitt News:

A number of printed leaflets
have appeared on campus urging
students to vote against the new
Student Government (SG) Consti-
tution. Several commuters have
been sent letters telling them to
do likewise. I’d like to know who
has the money to have handbills
privately printed and can afford
to mail to commuters.

The content of this material
points to dirty politics, making
accusations without proof. at-
tacking people and in no way of-
fering any alternatives. Is this
another attempt by the Cundra-
Cavaluchy-Haley coalition people)
to try to take power from the stu-
dents or is the Pitt administration
behind this?

It took two years of open hear-
ings, committee study and the
vote of two thirds of the Senate to
approve the Constitution. After all
this. several open hearings. distri-
bution of material and talks. both
pro and con, which were publicly
advertised.‘ don’t tell me this is
being forced on students.

I again want to know: who has
the money for all of this? Or. bet-
ter yet. is someone trying to run
alone for SG president in January
and control everything? Find out
yourself; Power to the students.
The new Constitution is the only

US Socialism
L Hurts Blacks

Editor, The Pitt News:

This is in reply to the column by
Paul Le Blanc (Does Socialism Fit
Black Liberation?).

Black people do not have to read
any book to be enlightened on the
inequities of socialism. Let's take
public education first. LeBlanc
contended that socialism is an
equitable system. I

He would have to search a long
time to find a black person to tell
him that the education received in
the schools within the black com-
munity received an equal fiscal
appropriation from the state and
that the facilities provided by the
state are equal to those of the
white suburban schools.

Because of the unequal educa-
tion provided by the state to the

black communities around the.

country, many colleges have low-
ered their standards for black en-
trants. Certainly. this is not cap-
italism.

Before public education was ini-
tiated in 1840, the private schools
were integrated. It was not until
after the establishment of the pub-
lic school system that there was a
movement to segregated schools
and neighborhoods.

If people do not feel oppressed
by socialism. then why was there
a Welfare Rights’ Organization
formed‘?

As far as the issue of public
housing is concerned, also a social

ist theme, the government has in . . 3
many cases condemned the’ homes _

of blacks and forced them to move-

out. The government has then;

torn down the homes and replaced
them with public housing units
that are next to nothing. When
public housing is instituted, the
people themselves have no say

about design. Urban renewal is , .

nothing more than black removal.

People are equal in socialism.

but some people are more equal
than others. Unless the individual
does well on early examinations
in the schools, his chances to"at-
tend college ‘are quelled.

The Black Muslims is the most

economically successful black~or-?

ganization there is and they are
black capitalists. Although black
capitalism is not enough, other
communities should followmthe
lead of this group. Anyone who be-

lieves that racism can be wiped "I

and liberation achieved by replac-
ing one economic system with an-
other is either lying or misinform-
ed. '

MOTIVATION

If this is true. what would we
require to reach this ideal state‘?
Two of the most important factors
involved in the voluntary control
over fertility are education and
motivation.

Although there is no conclusive
evidence that universal access to
birth control information. sup-
plies and services would be suffi-
cient to bring the birth rate into
balance with the death rate. it is
effective and has. even in its lim-
ited availability, freed women of
compulsory pregnancy.

Motivation to prevent a birth.
often nonexistent before pregnan-
cy, can become quite high'once
pregnancy occurs. Abortion. as a
method of birth control as well as
a backup measure for contracep-
tive failure, must be recognized
and legalized.

Since 1967 there has been a
snowballing movement towards
reform or repeal of abortion laws
in almost every state of the Un-

THOSE TO BE BORN . . .

I have deliberately omitted thep
ological questions concerning
abortion for I feel that until it is
truly recognized that the “sancit—
ity of human life" ext4nds beyond
the womb by those who argue on
these grounds. there is no com-
mon basis for discussion.

The time has come to include
in our present loud concern for the
environment concern for the lives
of children now born and for those
to be born.

Perhaps we should proclaim
the next century The Century of
the Wanted Child.

We would then recognize that
more crucial than the right to be

born “whole in body. brain and’

senses. to be nourished material-
ly. emotionally and mentally and
to stand in a world where there is
space and beauty . . . no child
must be born without hope. no
woman must bear a child against
her will . .  and the homo sa-
piens must not overwhelm the
earth.

Professor Lambasts Greek Junta

by TOM HEIPLE

Dr. A. G. Pollis aruged Tuesday
night that the military junta of
Greece is pushing the nation clos-
er to fascism.

Dr. Pollis. professor of politi-
cal science at the New School for
Social Research. spoke before ap-
proximately 75 people at the Uni-
versity and City Ministries (UA-
CM).

Every official government state-
ment coming out of Greece since
the present regime took over be-
gins with "we have come to pow-

er because of the threat of a Com-‘

munist takeover.“ Dr. Pollis

termed that statement being "ab-.

solutely ridiculous." In the Greek
press. however.‘ the ruling junta
continually advises the people that
they "should begin to accept the
permanence of our rule.“

The Greek regime “is adopting
every one of the steps . . . that ev-
ery dictatorial regime adopts that
intends to be permanent,”' she
contended.

Disputing the claim by many

that with the establishment of a"

parliament and a political party.
Greece is moving towards demo-
cracy. she dismissted the parli-
ment as having no legislative pow-
er and the political party as em-
bracing only the political ideas of
the regime. She compared their
creation as steps similar to those
taken by Franco when he took
over Spain. She believes that cur-
rent Greek officials are tied to
those of the European fascist re-
gimes of the 1930‘s.

   

one of our
Paulists calls

it “home”...

Home is where the heart is.

Home is also wherever a
Paulist is needed.

Whether the Paulist works
in a ghetto, a college campus,
a city parish or a remote
corner of the United States,
he is serving.

The Paulist is ministering
with words, deeds and sacra-
ment . . . and zealous care to
the needs of God‘s People
everywhere. He is meeting
today’s problems with thoughts
of those that will arise
tomorow.

That is the Paulist way. It
isn‘t easy but the worthwhile

As for the educational institu-
tions. Dr. Pollisclaims that all
the reforms that had taken place
prior to the generals‘ coming to
power have been done away with.
History books have been rewrit-
ten to show the “degeneracy” of
democratic regimes. Concluded
Dr. Pollis. "The values they ad-
here to are very anti-modern. “

An example of the sentiment of
many Greeks concerns the bomb-
ings of recent weeks in Athens.
One bomb went off near the meet-
ing place of George Papadopoulos,
Greek Prime Minister, and a high

American government official.
Another went off “apparently pre-
maturely” in the parking lot of
the United States Embassy.

And another explosion. as yet of
undetermined origin. rocked the
home of a Greek ship owner who
had on occasion entertained the
"bigwigs" of the Greek regime.
Dr. Pollis believes it is evident
that the terrorism is directed en-
tirely at Greek and American offi-
cials.

“United States policyfl. con-
tends Dr. Pollis. "is very clearly
unqualified support for the Greek
regime." The arguments given by

American officials for supporting
the Greek government is that
Greece is a key NATO ally.

The second reason is that Amer-
can officials admits that “grant-
ed, something is wrong” but it is
evident that moves have been tak-
en by the Greek regime to restore
constitutional government. Dr.
Pollis denied that Greece under
the generals was either stable or
moving towards democracy.

Compounding the problem. P011-
is blamed the "extremely poor
coverage" about Greece in the
news media of this country. She
added that Europeans are much

more informed as to the situation
in Greece.

Dr. Pollis declared that “none

of the European countries support’

the Greek regime." The Euro-
pean Council of Nations was ready
to expell Greece on charges of vio-
lating a whole series of human
rights by being "systematically
involved in torture." However.
Greece withdrew to avoid being

Equal Employment Promised To HEW

by SUE HOE NSTINE

The University’s Affirmative Action
Program. which is concerned with dis-
crimination’ against women and other
*minorities in employment practices, was
submitted by demand to the Department
of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW)
on Saturday.

According to Dave Powers, assistant
to the chancellor for Academic Affairs.

1 tithe program represents a commitment

to the federal government and we will fol-
low it through."

When questioned about discrimination
against women in the University, Powers
pointed out that the study concerns the
University only as an employer. All in-
stitutions receiving federal grants have

’ 6 or will be ordered to submit a report con-

cerning equal employment opportunities
to HEW.

Recently the University Committee
for Women‘s Rights took a number of
complaints to HEW concerning discrim-
ination against women here. Powers said
that “the issuance of complaints against
the University by the women may have
caused the report to be due earlier."

MINORITY CONTACT
The study does state that “frequent
Contact with minority group members

. and women reveals the extent of the prob-

lem: discrimination is indeed felt. Com-
plaints are frequent that little perceived
role is played by these groups in the
making of substantial policy. in the man-
agement of programs and resources. and
providing input into the spectrum of de-
cision-making activities." A

Continuing, it was mentioned that
“whatever the connection between beha-
vior and attitude, the administration of
the University has declared its sincere in-
tention to act to rectify the inequities‘
that a historic pattern of interdependent
elements has created in society."

Powers asserted that “we are living
in a sexist and racist society. Careers are
chosen by cultural position. With this in
mind. Pitt can play a unique role by

‘ changing the market to improve the ed-

ucational levels and opportunities for
blacks and women. "

A sensitizing program is outlined in
the program and the study states. “The
University will continue to consult ex-
perts to examine the psychological and
sociological roots of bigotry, institutional
racism, and sexism that contribute to the
unjust treatment of minority members
and women.“

EMPLOYMENT
“The University is concerned not only
with its own employment practices but

also intends to play a leadership role in
developing. through its various schools.
systems and methodology that mya be ap-
plicable to society at large in the advance-

ment of equal employment opportunities."

Powers pointed out that a maternity

leave policy has been initiated. The study I

specifically mentions “women are grant-
ed leaves of absence of up to one year
with assurance of reinstatement to a pos-
ition in the University determined by the
Personnel Division as equivalent to their
past position.

Concerning salary inequities, the Af-
firmative Action Program proposes a re-
view of the salary structure within the
University. The study asserts that “in
faculty positions. preliminary studies by
rank indicate that Black personnel are
now paid more than average salaries and
women essentially the same as average.

“Continuing is necessary to insure
that supervisors do not discriminate in
setting salaries on the basis of race, sex.
religion or national origin, and that the
principle of equal pay for equal work and
responsibility is applied without excep-
tion. In preparing the FY 1971-72 univer-
sity budget, specific attention will be giv-

en to correcting salary inequities should

any be found.”

DIFFICULTIES
Powers pointed out that since other in-

stitutions will be involved in similar Af-
firmative Action Programs “it will be
difficult to achieve our goals in recruiting
and hiring women and blacks."

The final analysis of University goals
states “it is believed that the indicated
growth in employment of minorities and
women is feasible within current pros-
pects for funding of the University, but
will be extremely difficult to achieve in
the contemporary employment market,
as other universities also embark on af-
firmative action programs."

The study concludes by outlining the
following objectives for the University:
toto increase the percentage of minority
members among our male faculty from
8.3 to 11.1 per cent. Further, it is our
goal to increase the percentage of wom-
en faculty from 19.7 per cent of the total
faculty to 23.5 per cent in the coming ten
months.

Of the women faculty, it is believed
feasible to increase the percentage that
are from minority groups from 9.7 to
18.5 per cent. The University of Pitts-

burg will launch an aggressive recruiting I

effort in order to achieve these goals."

Powers feels that the HEW study “is
an incredibly progressive report” and he
concluded that the loss of Pitts $15
million federal grant is quite unlikely.

Organic Foods Dielautl‘

by KATIE LOGAN

“Ecologically sound." That’s what Glen Kopelov said as he and
Margaret Ertman explained the philosophy behind the new organic
foods section of the Oakland Co-op.

The new section of the co-op is part of an ecological plan. Not only
is the food organic (it hasn’t been “sprayed, stimulated, bleached and
processed”) but patrons of the store also use their own shopping bags.
“Why cut down another tree?” Kapelov cracked.

People also use and reuse their own jars. The products are not
wrapped in. plastic or colored cellophane. There are large barrels of
grains and even some barrels of peanut butter.

People scoop up their own product and put it into their own contain-
er. This makes for lower prices since the price of packaging is not in-
cluded with the product.

Kapelov and Ertman, both of whom are helping to organize the
organic foods section, said that the grand opening will be at “high noon”
on Saturday, Nov. 14.

The organic foods section is located in the basement of the Oakland
Co-op, 3601 Blvd. of Allies. Anyone who can help is asked to come. Help
consists of anything from scrubbing floors to donating money. Says
Kopelov, “If you have a favorite recipe, bake it, broil it, bring it. so all
may share and enjoy.” .

 Cats End Homeseasoll

by JERRY MYERS

Soaring high after their 65-12
thrashing of Buffalo last week, the
Boston College Eagles invade Pitt
Stadium tomorrow, exhibiting one
of the biggest teams the Panthers

have faced to date.

With balance, speed and pow-
er the Eagles present a tough foot-
ball team and promise to give the
Cats what Coach Carl DePasqua
calls "a wide open football game.“

Calling signals for BC will be
Frank “Red” Harris, the 15th
ranked quarterback in the coun-
try. Harris has 102—for-186 in
the passing department for a total
of 1.158 yards and five touch-
downs. Pitt’s assistant coach
Steve Petro claims that Harris is
“both a good runner and an excel-
lent passer’. He's got nice size and
very decent speed. They’ve got
the offense-—if he wants to, he can
run on any play.”

The offense that Petro is refer-
ring to includes the largest offen-
sive line the Panthers have en-
countered this season. Averaging
about 150 pounds across the front
five, the Eagles are anchored by
tackles John Brennan (6-3, 264)
and Gary Guenther (6-3, 253).

“Boston College is an extreme-
ly fine football team,” said De-
Pasqua. “The losses they’ve had
were against Penn State and the
Air Force Academy. They have
great balance, averaging about
400 yards a game to their oppon-
ents 270.”

Part of the rolling offense can
be attributed to Fred Willis, a 208

grinded out 772 yards this
season, averaging 5.2 yards per
carry and cashing in for eight

Backing up Willis in the Eagle
backfield are guys like Gene Co-

good speed,” said DePasqua.
“Willis has great speed and great

The Cats emerged from last

Dave McGrath who was side-

To alleviate some of his line-

0 Pa e l0—THE PITT NEWS-—Frida November 13 1970

Only A

Beginning

In next spring’s football drills, Coach Carl DePasqua will
begin the task of filling the positions in the starting lineups
vacated by this year’s seniors. Judging by the performances of
the freshman gridders this fall, it looks like much of the re-
placing will be done by the present Cubs.

_ Although the frosh won only one game in three, a 14-0
shutout of Kent State, they displayed a fine offensive attack
I and tight defensive play during the short season.

Both of the defeats, a 20-
A 10 loss to West Virginia in
the first game of the year,
and last week’s 21-20 shocker
against Penn State, could eas-
ily have been victories for
 Coach Bill Quinter’s squad.

     
  

Against the Mountaineers,
the Cubs fumbled away sev-
eral chances to score and
put only one touchdown on
the board, although they out-
gained WVU by more than
90yards.

A  Ironically, the last minute
loss to the Lions was the Cubs
best showing. Not only did

0 ‘several crucial situations, but the offensive running attack was
5 superb.

Quinter was handicapped in assembling a solid unit be-
 cause a majority of the frosh’s time is spent stimulating the
 varsity’s opponent’s offense and defense.

 

Nevertheless, the many outstanding individuals on the team ’

. compensated for it. Quinter is quite complimentary about the
 squad and he feels that they are all “a great group of athletes
with outstanding attitudes.”

 

On offense, there are many Cubs who will be able to
help DePasqua’s Panthers next year. Quarterback Bob Med-
P wid, for instance, may offer an alternative to the present
signal callers. ~

 

The major strength of the frosh was its ground game,
with four backs doing the bulk of the work. Clair Wilson and
John Chatman will give the varsity two breakaway halfbacks,
something they haven’t enjoyed for years.

Paul Felinczak played only two games at fullback, but
-proved to be a powerful runner in both. Stan Ostrowski, who
didn’t get much chance to run, was also impressive.

 

Several offensive linemen have a shot at starting next sea-
son. Dave Blandino, Dave Wannstedt, Mike Sonneborn, and
Glenn Hyde, all weighing over 220 pounds, blocked well in
the three games.

. Linebacker Lou Cecconi and defensive tackle Mike Hieber
lead the list of defensive standouts. Both Cubs were superla-
tive in all three games and made many important tackles.

, Along with Cecconi, Ken Paieski and John Aschenbach
should make strong additions to the Panther linebacker corps.

- John Robb, Carlos Hamlin, Jim Buckmon and Art Simon
' join Hieber as potential help for the varsity’s defensive line.

Bill Englert, Bill Adams, Lance Wall and Ed Marsteller,
I the defensive secondary for the Cubs, allowed only two Td
, passes against three good opposing quarterbacks. H

 

This year was only a beginning for the frosh who should
be able to help next year’s varsity.

Booters In Season’s
Finale Against Lions

by MIKE MILLER

The booters will close out
their home season with a match
against Penn State today at 1:30
p.m. in Pitt Stadium.

The Pitt soccermen sport an
8-3 record going into tomorrows
match while Penn State has main-
taineda 7-2 slate. ’

Though State is superior in
won lost standings Coach Leo
Bemis feels that his team has
performed equally well against

V common opponents.

Against common opponents
Penn State has allowed only two
goals while scoring seven. The
Pitt squad has scored as high
against the same opponents but
gave up five goals.

The coach would like to dis-
count the Bucknell match which
he feels his team shouldn't have

lost. The team was weakened
from injuries and the officiating
was questioned. This would put
the teams on a more even foot-
ing.

“If we play a good game this
is an even match.” said the
coach.” But they have a terri-
fic ball club, and they’re big
physically. They have seventeen
lettermen returning. I don’t think
they’re invincible. It’s a matter
of who wants this game. ”$a

Both teams played West Vir-
ginia but the coach disregarded
this match because Penn State
played WVU in the season.
State beat the Mountaineers,
5-0, while Pitt got past them
1-0.

Bemis feels that West Virginia

was weak early in their season
and the results might have been

Pitt Volleyball Team

Spikes, Carlow Girls

by ELLEN GANLEY
The women’s volleyball team brought home its second victory of

' the young season by stunning Chatham College in two games, 15-5 and

15-4. The contest was held at Trees Hall on Wednesday afternoon at

4:30 p.m.

Pitt’s captain Phyllis Wojiechowski won the opening toss and
chose to let Carlow serve first. The first Carlow server smashed a
powerful serve that got past the Pitt defenders. After this initial break,
the Pitt team got their effort together and the visiting team could only
manage four more points for the rest of the contest.

During the first match, the
Pitt team displayed some fine
play, setting up the ball for the
most effective shooting and spik-
ing by the front line. Also each of
the Pitt players consistently serv-
ed the ball over the net for more
home points. Rose Smith served
for three points, Kathy Utz for
two, Elaine Kingas had four, Phyl-
lis Wojiechowski for one, Kathy
Cassell had two and Pat Wallish
served up three points.

The subs were also given a
chance to play in the game. Coach
Bullman noted that “two positions
on the starting team haven’t been
taken yet.” The players she is ro-
tating at these positions are Pat
Wallish, Mina Altshuler, Anne
Brandon, Jan Clouse, Kathy Bould
and Kathy Utz.

At the start of the second match
of the contest, it looked as though
Carlow might come back to take
the second game and force a third
match to be played to decide the
winner. At this point. Carlow Col-
lege had a 4-2 lead over the home
team. Then Pitt freshman Kathy
Cassell rotated into the server‘s
position and served up 11 consecu-
tive points that the Carlow team
found extremely hard to handle.
Of her feat. Kathy said, “It didn't
seem like that many points. I

don’t think I’ve ever gotten that
many before.”

Coach Bullman noted that “this
contest gave us an opportunity to
use our subs. I was very pleased
with their performance.” About
her team, the coach said, “I have
more confidence in the group I
have this year because they’re
more skilled. If someone fails, I
have someone to fill the spot. The
bench is perhaps our strongest
point. The team is enthusiastic
when playing together and has the
right attitude for winning.”

The team’s next home game is
on Saturday, Nov. 21, at Trees
Hall at 1:30 p.m.

I am in the process of initiating a drive which purpose is to

they are in competition for the top spot with a team with a repu-
tation of football success in the past.

This task for gaining support for such a game is next to im-
possible for one person. The problem is that most people would _s
like to see the game but none has the time and effort to see it 1%
through. It is my hope that you can help this cause along by mak- ._

Wednesday and the Coach hopes
it won't affect tomorrow's match.
The Penn State game was origin-

the coach didn’t want the team to
go stale.

Bemis intended to use some jun-
ior varsity players to keep his
starter’s action limited.

Many former Pitt players are
on the Harmarville squad and
Bemis feels that he can keep the
match controlled.

Gary Midock has reinjured his
knee and has been kept out of
scrimmage as Bemis wants his
team at full strength. Dave Di-
Emedio has also been troubled
with a leg injury and has been
resting.
~ Penn State has, according to
scouting reports, a fast forward
line that shoots well. Bemis
wants his defense to be up to
par to counter this threat.

This will be both teams’ final
match and the team hopes for
a large student turn—out.

“We need student
to beat State,” said Bemis.

IM Independents In Torrid Action

P.E. Club

Upsets The Machine’

by VINCE DiNARDO

"We’re going to knock you out of first place." threatened the
Physical Education Club intramural football team. Their threats
were directed toward the usually potent Machine team. The Ma-
chine, sporting a 4-1 record, didn’t seem to take the opponents

seriously.

The P.E. Club though, acted as though they knew something
about the Machine defense and fulfilled the threat, winning, 18-12.

On the very first play from scrimmage the RE. quarterback.

Bob Manfredo, dropped back and
easily threw to Barry Simon for
a 60-yard touchdown.

The machine didn’t roll over
and die, though. They. bounced

Law Cubs

Law Lions
In a clash of the law schools
played in the Wednesday eve-
ning mud, the Lions splashed

their way to a 12-6 victory over
the Cubs.

The Lions scored early. The
Cubs first pass was intercept-
ed, and two plays later, Paul
Leveton threw a 60 yard bomb
to end E. Strassburger.

The Cubs came right back.
Tom Branca passed the Cubs
down the field, capping the
drive with a 15 yard strike to
Chervenak.

After the kick off, the Lions
failed to move the ball, and the
Cubs mounted one more drive.
But with seconds left in the
half, a halfback pass was inter-

cepted in the Lion end zone
by Gentile, his second of the
game.

The second half started with
the two clubs exchanging punts.

right back in three plays to score
their first touchdown. The play
was apass from Tony Pollichic-
cio to Ron Gulteri. It covered
about 10 yards.

The fact that the All-Purpose
Fields were a quagmire didn’t
bother the P.E. Club as they
also bounced back for another
score.

Manfredo again dropped back
to pass and this time hit half-
back Gene Petrafoco with a screen
pass that also covered 60 yards.
So on two plays, the P.E.‘s cov-
ered 160 yards and 12 quick
points.

It looked like it was going to
be a defenseless game as the
Machine bounced back again
on three plays as Polichiccio hit
Rich Stannish with a 650-yard
touchdown to tie the game, 12-
12.

As the second half began, it
seemed the offenses had gone
home as the game turned into
a defensive battle. But, only for
amoment.

Crisp blocking became very
evident, but the P.E.’s managed
to score on a fourth down play
from the Machine three-yard-
line for their 18th and final
points.

Scoreless Skein Ends

But Table Wins Again

by STEVE WILLIAMS

The TDs scored against the Table defense to blemish their
scoreless skein, but that is the only blemish they made, as the Table

won their fourth game 20-8.

The table scoreless streak of seven consecutive halves was
broken in the second half when Bob “Trio” King was on the scoring
end of a double play from quarterback Bill Esper to halfback Russ
Fish and finally to King. The pass play covered seven yards and
was followed by a two-point kicked conversion by Dan McGrew

which at that moment tied the
score, 8-8. The touchdown was
set up by King’s interception of
an errant Bob Madar pass.

The first Table scoring occur-
red in the first half when after
an interception by defensive back
John Stanich, Bob Madar com-
pleted a thirty yard scoring
bomb to him. On the rain soaked
field Bill Esper slipped and fell
after Stanich’s fake, leaving him
wide open for the td pass.

Steve Volk kicked the two-
point conversion for an 8-0 lead
at the half.

Following the Td’s score in
the second half, Table began
to roll offensively, scoring on a
35-yard pass to blocking-back
Karl Manns on a delayed pattern
over the middle. -

The conversion
Table led, 14-8.

Table’s defense then held the
TDs on downs.

They quickly followed with a
thirty yard pass to Stanich, who
made a superb catch of the ball
which was deflected by Esper.
The conversion was unseccessful, ,

failed and

 

resulting in the final score 20-8.

But with time running out the
TDs sustained apparent scoring
drive which was thwarted by an
interception by Steve Volk deep
in Table territory to assure the
victory.

Stanich and Madar starred both
on offense and defense. Stanich
intercepted two passes from TD
quarterback Bill Esper. Both
passes were within five yards of
the TD goal line. Madar inter-
cepted his pass in the end zone
after the TDs had driven down
to the one yard line.

The TD defense did hold the
Table scoring machine to only
twenty points. In Table’s three
previous games they amassed
scores of 44-0, 33-0, and 54-0.
for almost 44 point per game
average.

The defensive stars for the TDs
were Dave Thomas, who inter-
cepted two passes in the first
half, and Bob King, who inter-
cepted two in the second half.
One of King’s, interceptions
was in the TD end zone.

2 Q. What should I serve when the boys drop over?

' A. The perfect beverage for moments of celebration
and good fellowship like this is Pabst Blue Ribbon
beer. its good old-time flavor helps break the ice
and get the party rolling.

  
 

0. What's the oldest
brewery in Milwaukee?
A. Last year Pabst Brewing Com-
pany, the oldest in Milwaukee. cele-
- brated 126 years of brewing great beer. And that's older
than your father's, father's, father's, father's moustache. Which
brings us to our point: if you believe that practice makes per-
fect. then you can't find a more perfect beer than a Pabst.

  Everything You've Always .

3 _ Q. Who are these guys? I
A. Thisisagroup photo ofour bowling T
team. It was taken in 1893, the year
Pabst won the Blue Ribbon as Ameri— ‘I.

ca's best beer. We still brew our beer
‘ the o|d—time premium way.Our bowling L
team hasn't changed much either. 6 .

   

O. What'll you have?

A. Pabst Blue Ribbon,because
it has something no other
beer has . . . good old-time

V flavor. And if perchance we
have not covered every-
thing you've always wanted
to know about beer but
were afraid to ask . . . quell
those fears. You'll find the
answers to all your ques-

tions inside an ice-cold

bottle or can M" 

of Pabst. On

second

thought,
why notbuy

a 6-pack?

it's our

"refresher"

course.

  
  
 
 
  
   
 
 
 
 
 
 
  

4 Q. What are these horses trying to pull?

' A. They're pulling one day's production of Pabst beer. This often caused
traffic jams outside the brewery. These tieups were the results of efforts
to supply the increasing demand for Pabst. A demand that has remained
unquenched to the present day.

5.

Q. How is Pabst
brewed?

.A. 1. Choice hops
are gathered and
placed here.86.
Then we mix in
only the best
grains. 22. Then V
the beer is allowed to brew slowly and naturally. 64. Look closely.

This is a secret process that gives Pabst its good old-time flavor. _  "
