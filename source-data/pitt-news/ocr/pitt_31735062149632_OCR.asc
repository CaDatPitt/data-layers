Outlines Plans

For Services

Yesterday’s program in the chapel
marked the beginning of the fourth
series of’ University services this
year, announced Raymond F. Brit-
tain, instructor in history religion
and in charge of the general arrange-
ments for the services.

_“What we_want to do is to try as
many things as possible and ‘find out
which of these is best for the Univer-

’ sity,” explained Mr. Brittain.

Dr. ‘William R. Farmer, professor
of practical theology at the Western
Theological Seminary, lead the pro-
gram yesterday afternoon with an
address titled “In the Morning.”

The program conducted yesterday
by Dr. Farmer is the ﬁrst of a series
under his leadership which will con-
tinue for a trial of about two months,
according to Mr. Brittain.

Services will be held three times
weel-:1y—Sundays at 2:30 o’clock, and
on Wednesdays and Fridays at 1
o’clock. However, because of the
holiday, no services will be held this
Wednesday.

did” the proposed plan of a student
“ommittee to aid refugee students, Dr.
Dlin D. Wannamaker, American di-
rector of Lingnan university in Can-
ton, China, evidenced great interest
‘n the project in an interview with
-Fhe News, Friday. ' -

Commenting on the criticism ofth
2-lan on the ‘_‘charity begins at home”
Wannamaker, who was
:i_sit_ing the University last week, de-
lared that “we can’t afford to act on
hese emotions.”

"The moral, intellectual, and spir-
Itual benefit,” he explained, “to be
Jbtained from sharing and’ mingling
.vith the oppressed students of other
‘-ountries vastly outweighs any hard-
ships which may be caused among
American students.”

According, to Dr. Wannamaker, if
‘he American student is stirred up
and made to take interest in what is
happening throughout the world, it
will result in increased interest in,
and more benefit for the student here.
America, he said, will proﬁt by be-
ng a refuge for the oppressed.

The current refugee drive among‘
college students, continued Dr. Wan-
namaker, is an important counter-
movement to a menacing reactionary
undercurrent now prevalent in this
country.

Dr. Wannamaker also commented

in China are still operating, although
only two remain on their own

moved from Canton‘. China, since the
Japanese occupation of that-city, to
the British university in Hongkong.
Many of the old faculty, however,
have remained on the Canton campus

ugees. '

Both Penn State and the University
contribute to the upkeep of Lingnan,
the American director declared. Two
years, ago John P. Baker, 21 student
at the University, spent a year of
study at the Canton school. A Uni-
versity graduate, Henry Frank, one
of the outstanding research scient-
ists in China, is on the Lingnan staﬁ.

Sipes ‘R/'ould Substitute
A New Plan

TO THE STUDENT BODY:
Through the medium of the Pitt News you have

learned that there is a Plan to aid refugee students. Its ,

possibilities are now being investigated. You have also

been informed that there is a movement now in progress ..

which aims to discourage the Refugee Plan and to sub-
stitute in its place a plan of increasing the student loan
fund of the University of Pittsburgh.

On behalf of the Plan to aid our own students you
should know the following:

1. We contend that Charity begins at home.

2. We contend that it is undesirable to increase
the number of people seeking work, which the
refugees must do upon completion of their educa-
tion, by bringing more people into the country.

If you feel that you favor the Refugee Plan then we
ask you to give it your whole-hearted support. If, on
the other hand you favor our Plan, we ask you to show

. your approval by addressing a penny postcard to the

AMERICAN STUDENT AID COMMITTEE, care of the
Dean of Men’s Oﬁice. Give us your name, address, tele-
phone number and the school in which you are regis-
tered. Indicate your willingness to serve on a Com-
mittee.

The amount of cards received will determine whether
or not our project will be continued, involving two
points: (1) discouragement of the Refugee Plan (2)
Aid to the University of Pittsburgh Student Loan Fund.

Your help and co-operation is solicited. Sincerely,

BROOKS N. SIPES, C39

Dissaproves Sipes’

Stand on Refugees

Editor, The Pitt News.
Dear Sir:
In reference to Mr. Sipes’ opposition to the allevia-

tion of the .refugee’s plight, I wish, as an outsider of ,

student activities, to make a few remarks showing an
utter disapproval of such a stand in the eyes of present
day civilization.

“It is useless to try to provide for the intellectual
well-being of foreigners when we are not providing for
the physical well-being of Americans.” A statement, it

must be admitted, well—spoken and not without an ele-

mentoftruth. But it is a very limited statement over-
looking much. It does not take into consideration the
fact that the problem exists, not only in a bounded area,
but it exists in the World as a whole. The problem is
not to be coped with by a few isolated groups, but by
every civilized individual who exists today, for it is
their civilization that is being threatened.

Fortunately, however, there still remain a few places.

which are havens of refuge. This country is. one of
them. Naturally a problem arises. What are we going
to do with them? They are here; more are going to
come. Are we going to let them wander about, adding
to the countless others already wandering?

It would be the wrong thing to do when we have a
great number of people who are willing to help them,
just as they are willing to help our own unfortunate
tiatives.

I do not say that aid to the refugees should displace
any help that can be rendered to the solution of our own
problems. But the refugees should not be overlooked;
not only for their sake, but for our own welfare. Edu-
cate them. Teach them our mode of life so that they
will be enabled to practice it. So that they will not in-
terfere with it with a mode not native to our land.

And this must be remembered in addition. They
are humans just as we are. If a mad, perverted despot
chooses not to treat them as such, and I am speaking of
all refugees of all races, politics, and religions; if he
chooses to drive them out like a herd of cattle, there is
no reason for us, as members of an advanced society to
let them stray and seek blindly. We may not be able to
stop the dictator at the present time. But, we can alk.a-
lize his acid madness.

Reader Troubled
By Dent Students’ Letter

Editor, Pitt News.
Dear Sir:

I have been troubled by the Dental School Junior
class’s defection from the ranks of enthusiastic support-
ers of the refugee aid proposals. I feel certain that these
Juniors are the only ones to protest against this ex-
pression of idealistic sentiment. Nobody else protests;
and I hasten to reassure The News that they may con-
tinue to so logically reason away the foolish arguments
of the dissenters.

Along with my reassurances, I wish to add to the
general idea of refugee aid. Franco has driven out
many Loyalists; the Japanese have destroyed Chinese
colleges; Mussolini has maliciously dispossessed the
Ethiopians. Wouldn’t it be a grand idea to bring over
from among these hundreds who have lost many pre-
cious days of schooling?

Take the Ethiopians for instance: they don’t even
need a college education. We could teach them to read
and write. That wouldn’t cost much because they eat
very little and wear practically nothing.

There is a rumor going the rounds whispered from
Thaw Hall to the Commons Room via State, that a peti-
tion is to be passed around to protest refugee aid. This
is ridiculous because the Dental School Juniors alone
would sign it. There is not a compact coercive faction
consistency of about 10 per cent of the studentbody
that could privately blacklist the petitioners and thus
jeopardize their aspirations to campus recognition. Isn’t
it all silly? I overheard someone say that since the op-
pressed had a right (denied them by totalitarian op-
pressors), as implied in The News, to pursue their edu-
cation; let them demand their rights-—but not from the
U. S. I say of course they have rights and we should all
accede or be narrow.

In closing let me further assist The News by point-
ing out that Mayor Scully, Chief Justice Hughes, and
President Roosevelt himself, be asked to endorse this

Students Favor
Coinpulsor§* Sex Study

ucation should no longer be a matter
to be whispered about, a large ma-
jority of American college students
believe. In fact, almost 62 per cent
of them favor making courses on the

principles of sex compulsory, a na-

.ion Surveys of America shows.
‘ In fact, many colleges are now of-
fering marriage courses. Student re-
gard this an important part of their
education when they say they believe
such instruction should even be made
obligatory. Interviewers have asked
this question to a scientiﬁcally-de-
ﬁned cross-section from coast to

in colleges be made compulsory?”

YES, say . . . . . . . ..6l.9 per cent

Versitile Dr. Avinoff Reviews 55
Years of Service, Achievement

By John Brosky

February 14 represented a double
occasion for Dr. Andrey Avinoif, di-
rector of Carnegie Museum and as-
sistant professor of ﬁne arts at the
University. That day he celebrated
not only Valentine Day, but also his
55th birthday. ‘

Dr. Avinoif is noted as an entomol-
ogist, artist, -lecturer, explorer, orien-
talist, lawyer, astronemer, and lin-
guist. He also designed the Russian
nationality room in the University.

Wednesday evening, Dr. Avinoif
gave an illustrated lecture on “The
Art of the Russian Icon” in the ﬁne
arts library.

He explained that an Icon is “a
Russian ecclesiastical art of religious
subjects portraying Christ, Madon-
na, Saints, and Churches. The Icon
is not only an image but a hymn or
prayer in a pictorical form.”

In his lecture, Dr. Avinoif named
three isolating factors which kept

Russia away from the Western
World.
( 1) Geographical iso1ation—be-

cause of its proximity to the East,
Russia is absorbed the eastern tradi-
tions.

(2) Historical isolation—Russia
was under the yoke of the Tartans;
and at the beginning of the Renais-
sance, it maintained its Byzantine
and Romanesque traditions.

(3) Church isolation—Russia pre-
served the orthodox religion.

“In the late Renaissance period,”
he added, “the Baroque feeling pen-
etrated Russia and found expression
in paintings and exaggeration and
convulsions.”

The Russian Icons were created in
primitive style expressing religious
characters, he said, and the Icon was
made of wood with the white and
yoke of an egg as sizing. _

Dr. Avinoﬁ is the son of a family
of the old nobility who once ruled
the Novgorod district, which was
later the residence of the Czars.

His father was a lieutenant general
in the army, who traveled from place
to place, and on these journeys Dr.
Avinoff collected butterﬂies. ‘When
the Russian revolution occurred, the
government took from him more than
80,000 Asiatic butterﬂies and a price-
less set of books. _ _

His separate collection of the genus
Parnassius numbering 10,000, is the
largest collection of this specie in the
world. This was also nationalized
by (the Soviet government. The Rus-
sian government now sends parts of
the collection to Dr. Avinoff for stu-
dy, with the stipulation that he must
return them.

Before he became an entomologist,
Dr. Avinoff studied law at the Uni-
versity of Moscow and for some time
was in the government service. He
was the highest otﬁcial in the Senate
in Russia, which corresponds to the
position of the chief justice of the
United States Supreme Court.

In 1922, Dr. Avinoff came to Pitts-
burgh to catalog butterﬂies for the
Carnegie Museum. He assumed the
directorship of the Museum in 1926.

Job Prospects

’ A decided. upswing in the number
of jobs available to graduates of the
University is reported by Edward B.
Williams, director of the University
placement bureau for men.

The number of University men
placed in permanent jobs since June
of 1938 has reached 136 as compared
to 117 for the entire previous year.
The salaries of these men average
between $115 and $120 per month,
Mr. Williams states.

The greatest demand has been for
trained engineers. Students with
general and business training and
with selling ability are next in de-
mand. The number of students
placed in accounting jobs ranks
third.

Since the placement bureau for
men was founded in October, 1933,
a total of 1,126 men have been placed
in fulltime jobs. This does not in-
clude men placed in teaching posi-
tions through the School of Educa-
tion, nor does. it include graduates
of the professional schools of Medi-
cine, Law, Pharmacy, Dentistry, Re-
tail Training, and the Graduate
School. ‘ ‘

Varsity Runners Set

To Crack Old Marks

In Indoor Title Meet

Ohl, McKee, Ferrara Favored
To Take Over Additional Crowns

By Joe Kristufek
As the entry blanks continue to pour into the athletic office, in-
dications are that this year’s University indoor track championships
will be the most successful since their inauguration seven years ago.
Many old records are sure to be equalled or broken this Saturday
as most of last. year’s varsity and many outstanding freshmen have

already turned in their entries.

Since Johnny Woodruif’s leg in-9

jury will keep him from running,
any new records that are set will
probably be due to Frank Ohl, Allen
McKee, or Al Ferrara, J ohnny’s mile
relay teammates. Ohl, adjudged the

"best lead-off man in the East by

track experts, will seek to add Dick
Mason’s vacated 50-"yard dash crown
to his two-lap dash and broad-jump
titles. McKee, one of the country’s
best at 600 meters, is defending
champ in both the 440 and 880. Re-
cently he ran four laps of the indoor
track. in 74 seconds, which is a new
indoor record for this distance.

Ferrara, fourth member of the relay,

team, was runner-up in the two lap

dash and quarter mile last year and,

will be out to beat his teammates in
these ‘events this year.
Sophs Press '

The ﬁght for ﬁrst place in these
three events will not be limited to
the three Junior stars, for__,a trio of
Sophomores, Bud Graf, Larry Tre-
gonning, and Del Anderson,
been pressing them all season. Tre-
gonning, capably ﬁlling WoodrufI’s
position on the relay team at pres-
ent, is expected to give a good ac-
count of himself, while Graf and An-
derson have been showing up well
in recent practices.

Mile Prospect

Another outstanding Sophomore
entry is Al Boulanger, smooth-strid-
ing distance runner from Indianna,
who will be out to set a new mile in-
door record. Although he didn’t re-
port for practice until last week, Al
has been showing excellent form,
and he will probably rank among the
nation’s best miler’s before the sea-
son is over. Walt Sterner, Univer-
sity two—mile outdoor record holder

and a number one man of the cross-
country team, will furnish his chief
competition. In the two-mile event,

Al Zamborsky, cross—country cap-
tain, diminutive Frank McCabe, and
veteran Casimir Kopec will battle
Sterner and Boulanger for top hon-

ors. V
Ryden Favored

Senior Ken Ryden, indoor and out-
door record holder in the high and
low hurdles, will probably win his
specialties with ease, with a close
battle being waged for the remain-
ing position. Sophomore Joe New-
man rates a ‘slight favorite over
Frank Kristl and the Sulkowski

-bothers, Bob and Henry, to ﬁnish

second to Ryden. The Sulkowski
duo are expected to place wellin the
high-jump but Dave McDowell,
Sophomore star from Gary, Indiana,
is the most likely choice to win the
crown formerly held by Pete Bennett.

Entry Blanks Due
McDowell. is also a pole-vaulter of

note and should press George Clif-
ton, blonde Sigma Chi prexy, for the
vaulting title. Clifton has shown
considerable, improvement this year
and may set a new indoor track rec-
od. Ed and Ernie Dines are possible
place winners in this event. There
is little doubt as to the outcome of
the shot-put event, as Johnny Bazyk,
blonde Brooklyn giant, has been- dis-
playing his best form to date and he
may break his own record which he
set last year. Gridder Ted Konet-
sky, winner of the freshman shot-
put last year, will ﬁght for second
place against Paul McNeill and Char-
ley Schroeder.

Entry blanks will continue to be
received by Coach Olson in the ath-
letic oﬁice till Friday. All new con-
testants are urged to report to the
indoor track early this week in or-
der to get some practice before the
meet starts on Saturday at 1:80 p. m.

to direct Cap and Gown dance rou-
tines in 1935, but her contract with
the Alvin theater, where she was di-
recting the “Alvinettes,” did not al-
lowher time to do so. As a substi-
tute, Gene Kelly, ’33, started on the

and Gown shows.

This is not the first time that a wo-

staged the pageants for the county
sesquicentennial and is technical di-
rector for the Pittsburgh Playhouse.

lmann, C39; “May I Have a Rendezv-

ous With You,” by Louis, Fenderson,
