America's New Source of Hope: AbIhassanBaIni-Sadr

I By CINDY COHEN
I Pitt News Staff Writer‘ -
The election of Abolhassa
-Bani-Sadr as the new president of
Iran has been viewed by many
Americans as a new source of hope
for the quick release of the
hostages in Iran. But, as the
hostages reach their 90th day in
captivity, patience is running low
and tempers are running high.
Johnathan Anderson, a member

of the State. Department’s- special '

Working Group on Iran said,"They
(the Iranian students) are hanging
on to an issue that could destroy
them. Therelwill be retaliation if
‘the hostages are harmed.

process hasn’t pleased‘ all of the
people, or even some of the people.
Bitterness and‘ ﬁghting among the

marked.the proceedings that would
determine their respective budgets
for the next year. 

But changes were made in
virtually every area of the
allocations process this year" to
make, it more justiﬁable and
equitable to e‘\”/ery student or-
ganization, according to Kerry

arren, coordinator of the Student

Committee. ' ‘

liaison to 10 student groups.

Money ‘allocated to student
organizations comes from the
student activities fee and is held in
a general account. The account
amounts to approximately
$275,000, depending on ‘student
enrollment, said Warren.

added. '

This leaves about‘ $125,000 to be
allocated to recognized student
organizations, noted ,Warren.. 1

Recognition review is the first
change in the allocations process,
according to Warren. During the
fall term the allocations committee
handled the review process.

A recognized organization on
campus usually is permitted use of
university audio-visual equipment
and Student Union space for
activities among other benefits,
noted Warren.

ren, may request one of two

have to start worrying about.”
V Although Bani-Sadr’s election is

' seen as a positive step, the crisis

still appears, to be a far sight short
o_f resglution, according to Ander-
son. The fact that there is now one
central voice coming from Iran is
helpful. 4

“Up until nowvthere has been no

rea'l~effective government,” said .

Anderson. ‘ ‘Hopefully, ‘ these-

saner voices -will prevail, but to a

majority of these people martyr-
dom is glory.”
“Khomeini can "not afford to

. ignore the fact that Bani-Sadr was

elected with 80 percent of the
vote,” said Anderson. “Iran will
have to start looking at the big
picture. The Shah should become a

secondary issue because he is no
longer a threat to Iran.” 1 _

With the precarious balance of
super powers in the area heating
up with the Russian invasion of
Afghanistan, A‘nderson said, “We
have been trying to tell the Iranians
that the real threat is from the
north, not the west. But the way
they see it is that ‘Russia might be a
threat, but we were the ones that
held them down for 25 years.”

Hossein‘ Ava, attache at the
Iranian ‘Embassy in Washington
believes differently.

“I still think that the Shah is the
most importantissue, the internal
stability of our country depends on
the" activities of the Shah,” Ava
said. '

full. Fully recognized groups may
apply for unlimited allocations
while partial recognition allows a
group to apply to Student Activities

for $100 for operating ‘supplies and

recruitment, said Warren.
Presently, there‘ are 2 fully

recognized and C14 partial y"recog-

nized organizations, not [including

the Student Government Board and _

its.standing committees, according
to Warren.

A recognized organization is
placed in one of three categories-
SGB and its standing committees;
governance groups; and general
organizations. '

Recognized student or-
ganizations are ‘finding a major
difference in~/the amount of
information and time given to them
by the allocations committee, noted
Warren.

' Each/ recognized organization
was given a packet with in-
formation on how to plan an
itemized and prioritized budget,
she said. Prioritizing every item of
an organization’s budget is a new
rule this year, she added.

— This .is why the allocations
committee recommended ﬁnancial

-limits on the amount of funding

each group can request.  V

 

“We felt that by working within
‘a limit, a group could direct
attention to well-developed and
better quality programming, ’ ’_ said
lWarren. - '
Judgments on individual prog-
ramming items of a budget will be
based on a list of criteria, noted
Warren. This information was also
given to each organization, Warren
said.
. “It the of the

is right

organization to know how allocation T

decisions are made,” she added.
This list of criteria includes
judgment of concept, or how
relevant a program is to the student
body; the value and quality of -the
program; and the feasibility, or
how well a program is planned,
Warren said. , -
Thedeadline for budget requests
is Feb. 15, andfor those not
adhering to the deadline there will

be another change in the form of a '

five percent penalty, said Warren.
After March 17 no more budgets
will be "accepted and, Warren
added, those not complying will be

Ava said, ‘~‘The Soviet Union has

The main concern on everyone’s
mind is still the fastest and safest
way to resolve this crisis.

“I don’t think the election of Mr.’

people want—the return of the

Dr. Cottam |nvo|ved\|nf?
Iran Release Atternpts»

By CINDY COHEN
Pitt News Staff Writer

1 Dr. Richard Cottam, professor of
political science at Pitt is one of the
nation"s foremost scholars on
Iran. 1 He s ent a week in Iran
during November and December of
1979 in an attempt tojhelp expedite
the release of the hostages . by
talking to the people that he knew

in Iran. _g ' _- _ q 
Cottam‘§‘main objective was to

.“try and convince Iranians of the

sense of outrage. in the United
States and persuade them to deal
faster with the hostage situation. I
found that some people understood
this, but others didn’t. . But from an
overall point of view the trip was
useful.”

Cottam attended the University‘
of Tehran from 1951-52 and was
also second secretary at the
American Embassy in Iran from
1956-58. It was,,the people who
were then in oppositionftothe Shah"
that‘ -«he had followed and had

 quickly. ’ ’

contact with.

A “I was always monitoring the
opposition,” said Cottam, “and the
people I had always known were
now in the high levels of the new
government. These people know

my work and thought that I was

always fair to Iran.”

As far as the current situation is,,_.   
concerned, Khomeini still‘ hasythef" I

“Right no_W'. strong persqnal - ,1

Cottam explained that Kho-
meini’s decisional style is clear.
He’ll give Bani-Sadr free policy
reign unless he is not in accordance
with Islamic principle.

“lf Khomeini can be convinced
that something Bani-Sadr is doing
is not in line he may renege his
previous approval of a policy,”
Cottam said. -

Besides the new election of a
president, there has also been the -
reinstatement of the majlis (a
unicameral parliament) in Iran.
They may begin to also play a
major role “until they do some-
thing that bothers Khomeini,”
according to Cottam. .

Under article 110 of the Iranian
constitution, Khomeini retains
extraordinary powers, according to
Cottam. ,

 

The question remains “will they
fall into disuse when Khomeini
dies? Selecting a successor from
the religious leaders will be

And you thought you couldn't get-food this good this quick

difficult. There’ is no one now who

is so independent, or such a

charismatic leader,” Cottam said.
Cottam explained that one of the
failings in past years was the lack
of contact by the United States with
the opposition forces in Iran. He
said that people were ordered to
stop their contacts in 1-967. .. This

policy as instituted “by Prssident _

Johnson but most articulated by
Kissinger, Cottam said, “This was
because we were then supposed to
be in ‘a period of total commitment
to the Shah, even though at the
time he was visiting Moscow and
buying Russian, arms,” said
Cottam.

There was a liaison relationship
between the CIA and SAVAK for
debrieﬁng of Russians who came
across the Iranian border. SAVAK
was the secret police force under
the Shah. It-an’s function. as a
“listening post” was also a critical
factor, said Cottam. /

Unfortunately, because of the
broken contact with opposition, the

* _  .,-

only information force we had was
from SAVAK.

“And any U.S. ofﬁcial who
would listen only to them is crazy, ”
Cottam said. “But I don’t think
everybody did. No one realized
that the’ opposition was of any
importance.

“Those of us who told the State
Department for years that they
were important weren’t listened to,
but when they couldn’t deny it any
longer they started calling us down

Wayne State University in
Detroit allows residents to host
guests without signing them in or
requiring identiﬁcation. University
of Houston students choose the
visitation hours for the residence
halls in which they live. And the
resident students at University of
Wisconsin-Milwaukee must pay an
$8 fee for each day a guest remains

. in the dormitories beyond a'48-hour

"llrlitw
 ~»"I‘hese ﬁndings about college
residence hall policies were discov-

. ered by The Pitt News this week in

a telephone survey of ﬁve -urban
campus universities. ‘ '
The other universities included
in the survey were Northeastern
University in Boston and Temple

University in Philadelphia.

' Like Pitt, which is currently
reviewing its residence hall policy,
the five universities are located. in
major metropolitan settings.

A Three of- the ‘ﬁve universitiesyin _
the survey have 24-hour visitation,

policies, similar to Pitt's current
residence hall regulations. Only

one of the ﬁve universities, Wayne _
State,‘ does not allow‘ overnight-
guests, but a Wayne State official I

admitted the rule was difﬁcult to
enforce.‘ Guests ‘ of resident

students at the other four universit- V’

ies are permittedcto stay overnight
for periods oftwo to four days.

Currently, Pitt residence hall -

rules allow students to host

overnight guests for up to ﬁve-

Jays. A _
The University of Houston

does not allow "guests. ot the.

opposite sex to stay‘ overnight. g
However, three of the surveyed
universities—-Teinple, Northeast-

ern and isconsin-Milwaukee- »—

have policies which do not prohibit
ovemight- guests of
sex. I  .
Dr. Conney M. Kimbo. Vice
chancellor for‘ student ' affairs,
stands on his statement last week
-that “the great'majo_rity__of_ major

I

 

the opposite .

universities do not permit over-
night guests of the opposite sex (to
stay overnight)."

Kimbo said yesterday, “I have a
breakdown of quite a few samp-
lings of major schools that do not
have them (policies allowing
overnight guests of the opposite
sex).”

Northwestern, Purdue, Michi-
gan, Ohio State, Michigan State
and Indiana of Bloomington were
among the. universities Kimbo
named. \

Several ofﬁcials at the ﬁve
universities in the survey noted
that tightened security has been
established at their residence -halls
in recent years. But none’*of3the

universities’ officials ind-icated

movements on their cafnpuses to
change their current policies.-

At Northeastern, a 24-hour
visitation policy is in effect,

according to Judy Link, acting

director of housing. Overnight
guests, male or female, may stay
up to four consecutive nights.
“We did an extensive survey on
our visitation policy "last year, and

r the /general response was yes, the

students definitely wanted a
24-hour visitation -policy,” Link
said. “Therewere some against,
but the percentage was. low.”
Although guests‘ are permitted

for up to four days,. Northeastern

strictly adheres, to its; rule“ that
guests cannot roam. through the
residence halls”without being
accompanied by__the ; guest who

, ‘lsighns. him ‘in, said Link. H ‘

Elmer Hamann, director of

‘housing’ at ‘the I University of
' Wisc.onsin-_Mi1waukee, said the

university. -- has ofﬁcial visitation
hours ’of 8 a.m. to midnight
Sundays through‘-Thursdays and 8
“to”. 2" p'.rrl.* ‘Fridays and
Saturdays. However, he said there
is ‘‘no knocking on the (students’)
doors” at the end of visitation
hours. I i_ .

, “Our policyiworks well for us,
and we areinot getting the live-over

University of Wisconsin-Milwau-
kee policy states that a resident
should have the consent of his
roommates and/or suitemates be-
fore hosting a guest, no matter
what time of day, according to
Hamann. Because the campus has
exclusively suite-style housing with
four to ﬁve persons in a suite, a

student hosting a guest seems to '

understand when a suitemate is
irritated by the guest, Hamann
said. .

Hamann said the $8 fee charged
to students hosting guests who stay
overnight more than ‘two days is
effective in deterring extended
visits. '

At Houston, resident students’
guests are allowed to stay for up to
48 hours if they have the written
permission of their roommates,
according to Frank Sclafani, area
coordinator of the Moody Towers
residence halls. A permission slip
with the signatures of the resident,
the‘ guest, the roommate and the
resident adviser must be ﬁled,

‘Sclafani said.

Visitation hours vary at Hous-
ton’s residence halls, Sclafani
added.‘- Each residence hall votes
at the ‘beginning of fall term what
visitation hours shouldbe.

“After all the interviews, the

Page 6—Friday, February 1,1980

President Carter’s call for the resumption of
mandatory draft registration has been met with
mixed emotions from all segments of America's
population. To some, it is merely a change in federal
policy. To others, it is a step closer to war. And to
still others, it is a tough political move designed to
scare the Soviet Union away, tolet them know that
America does not like its incursion into Afghanistan.

There is another sector of our population that
views draft registration in a totally different light:
those young men (and maybe women) between the

_ ages of 18 and 26 who will be required to register with

They are the people who will be directly affected '

by mandatory registration, the Americans who will
anxiously survey the current international situation
and wait to see if they will have to fight for their

‘ country.

Unlike the late 1960s and early 1970s, the issue of
draft registration has divided the 18-to 26-year-olds,
with . some approving registration and others
opposing it.

Tuesday’s Student Government Forum on the

Draft illustrates this observation. The forum was an I

impressive and exciting event despite its gloomy
topic.

The forum prov_ed the students of our generation
do not exemplify the apathetic, carefree image}

sometimes portrayed by the media.

Unlike other events and issues in which students‘

have shown litle interest, draft registration hit close
to home. '
Not. only was the response impressive, butnearly
all the viewpoints espoused by the students were
articulate. Most of the students-who expressed their
views on the draft registration issue, both pro and
con, showed knowledge of the topic. It is refreshing,

The Student Government Board should also be
commended for sponsoring the forum. The board is
shown responsibility to its constituents by using
student opinion to develop a resolution to expressing

the Pitt students’ viewpoint concerning registration.

The board has a difficult job ahead of it, however.
Student views are so divergent that a resolution will
be difficult, maybe impossible to formulate.
Nevertheless, the forum shows the board’s concern

' for student opinion.

Finally, the appearance of senatorial and
Congressional aides proved, at least in this instance?
that Washington is concerned about the views of
young American voters. The aides were quite

attentive; some even offered to explain their ’

employers’ stances. on draft registration. We hope

H the aides use what they learned, to ‘inform and ~
__enlighten those in Washington who have not taken a
position on this issue.

: The forum proved to be an educational experience
for all who attended. In ‘the future, we hope the
Student Government Board will give students
opportunities to express their views in this fashion on
other important issues. We also hope the student‘
body will take such opportunities as seriously as they

Congress.

Carter's Weaknesses Are Reasons for Registration Opposition”

'1 would like to congratulate the

Student Government Board on

their recent forum on the draft. I
believe this was an excellent means
for the SGB to acquire a number of
differing opinions on this subject. I
look forward to future forums on
subjects that pertain to the
interests of the student body at
Pitt. This is a very emotional issue,
as’ is evidenced by the mixed

opinions delivered by the students

at the forum. Since the forum was

,divided 1 cannot believe" that the

SGB will go through with the

‘resolution declaring that the

students feel that registration
should or should not be allowed.

My own personal opinion on the
resumption of registration is one of
solid opposition. I do not feel
conﬁdent about President Carter’s
ability to lead the nation in
anything, let alone a war. I also do
not feel confidence in his ability to
make decisions of this kind since
this president has shown a consis-
tent naivete in his dealings with the
Soviet Union and instead of de-es-
calating confrontations ‘with the

USSR has in fact escalated them-
,because of his misguided inter-

pretations about Soviet aims. I do
not feel particularly threatened by
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.
The Soviet Union is rapidly dis-

the whole issue

desires.

covering the folly of this invasion
and realizing their own Vietnam.

_ Let them sit in it for as long as they

desire. My questions are these: Is
the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
adequate reason for the U5. to
begin sabre-rattling? When and if
the Soviet Union does invade Iran,
whose vital interests are really
being threatened, mine or the oil
companies? Remember that these
are the same oil companies who
graciously spend millions of dollars
on advertising to tell us just how
much research they are doing to
find alternative ways“of, energy
while they quickly buy up all the-\
patents on alternative energy
projects and sit on them. Do not be
mislead. Are we going to let an
apparent lack of technology to
overcome our energy crisis lead to
a military conflict the likes of which
the world may not survive? To me
seems quite
ludicrous. I simply cannot believe
that a war with the USSR will be a
conventional one. The sky-
rocketing defense budget bears
this out. The increased amount of
money that they have received over
the last five years indicates
advancement of technology to kill
more people faster. This year the ‘
Defense Department is utilizing all
these foreign threats, real or
imagined to garner the money it
President Carter is also

not on the losing side of foreign
threat, as this garners him~the
pay-off he so‘ much desires:bal-
lots. Witness the phrase “Don’t
change horses in mid-stream,” and
the reason why Franklin D. Roose-
velt won fourconsecutive terms.

Registration leads‘; to drafts
which invariably leads to war. This
is borne out in American history. If
we were to go to war with the
Soviet Union, will therebe a victor
and who will be around to proclaim
them as such?

Overlooked/pp
Issue

Tuesday afternoon at the SGB
forum concerning the draft, many
issues were raised. However, I feel
that the most basic fact was over-
looked.

Registration for the draft is the
first step in putting man against
man in armed military combat.
While registration does not mean
armed combat, the question is, or
should be, why armed combat?

In the past, man against man,
tribe against» tribe, peoples against

' I

other peoples and the killing
thereof, was useful only if one
group could decimate the other’s
population for land, for resources,
for treasure. . .

In this day ,and agewhere the
issues are political, this form of
combat is
_country’s population can only be
decimated by nuclear "warfare.
That form of warfare cannot be
used because of the undesirable
“side effects” of such use. One
man against another, killing one
another, is an agonizingly slow way
to destroy a population. So why is

the draft being reinstated? Its
purpose is preposterousl,

Let political issues be settled
politically. Young people’s lives
should not be sacrificed to buy time
for negotiations.

realize that no writer has a copy-

see Pitt play anywhere near its
capabilities; the spectators instead
witnessed a run-and-shoot battle

‘that produced 40 turnovers bet-

ween both teams. But for at least

Scott Grevey, the Panthers’
6-foot-2 sophomore guard ‘from
Hamilton, Ohio, played only 13
minutes against the Titans but
used the time well as he ﬁnished
with 11 points, enough to tie
teammate Sam‘Clancy for game-

, high scoring‘ honors.

With guard Dwayne Wallace out
indeﬁnitely with sprained liga-
ments in his left ankle, the
Panthers will surely need scoring
from their guards. Grevey ﬁlled
the void Wednesday night.

Grevey was not the only back
court man to take advantage of an
early Pitt lead, which allowed coach
Tim Grgurich to substitute freely.’
Darrell Gissendanner, also a
sophomore, scored nine points.

Syracuse may have had an
impressive 12-4 record coming into
Wednesday night’s game with Pitt,
but the Pantherettes did not
respect it as they clobbered the
Orangewomen 83-65. The Pan-
therettes will sport ‘a 16-7 record
when they seek revenge this

‘ weekend at Indiana.

Pitt jumped out to a 10-0 lead,
led by freshmen Penny Welsh and
Pam Miklasevich, before it allowed
Syracuse a bucket at the 15:55
mark. Hog/ever, the basket helped
the Orangewomen stage a come-
back as they closed the gap to two
with 10 minutes remaining.

It was the, closest Syracuse would
get to Pitt all night. The ﬁnal 10
minutes of the first half belonged to
Pitt’s Debbie Lewis and her
cohorts. Lewis pumped in eight
points wlfile recording three
assists. Welsh and Miklasevich
each .added eight as the Panther-
ettes built a comfortable 41-26
halftime lead.

It took just four sebonds for
Miklasevich to drop the ﬁrst bucket

of the second half, and the
Pantherettes were off and running.
Syracuse ‘had no chance to mount
an attack —as the Pitt defense
allowed back-to-back baskets only
ﬁve times.

“I_thought we played real well
tonight,” said coach Jean Bal-
thaser. “Welsh and Lewis were
consistently in the play,‘ pulling
down key rebounds or starting fast
breaks.”

 However, words could not be
found to describe" the performance
of Miklasevich. She was tough on
the boards, pulling down 23
rebounds. She only missed the
hoop seven times, hitting on 11 of
18 from the floor and swishing all
nine of ‘her shots from the charity
stripe. Miklasevich’s 31 point total
etched her name in the record book

' for most points scored in a game at

Fitzgerald Field House, an honor
she shares with Wanda Randolph.

Another record was almost
broken Wednesday night by
captain Kathy Paczkowski. She fell
one assist short of the game record

15. Eleven of those assists came

Two unbeaten teams clash this
weekend as Pitt’s men's swimming
team takes on West Virginia in
Morgantown. .

Both teams own 6-0 records and

have already met this year at the

Penn State Relays. In that meet,
West Virginia placed third and the
Panthers fourth. .
.“This will be a very tough meet
for us because it is on the road and
they’ have more depth than us,”

said Pitt coach Fred Lewis. “Our 1
__ strengths are their weaknesses.’_’

The strong points to which Lewis
refers are the sprint freestyle, the
backstroke and the breaststroke. It
is in these events that Pitt stands
its best chance to overcome the
tough Mountaineers.

Rick Carter, ranked third in the V

nation in the 100-meter freestyle
along with Scott Shearer, and Stu
Swanson, ranked ninth nationally
in the 200-meter backstroke,
should give the Mounties all they
can handle. Sandy Pidgeon in the

breaststroke -is also expected to .

dominate his event-

“The real difference will be
whether our divers can beat their

and Scott Winkler are the Pitt

‘ "hopefuls for the diving events.

they will probably fold,” added

V Two years and several thousand miles ago, I wrote
a little story depicting life on the road in that favorite
of all Pitt minor sports modes of transportation, the
van. At the time, the constant travel that becomes all
too familiar to college athletes was still some sort of
adventure—but certainly nothing you’d ever read
about in Temple Fielding’s books.

Since then, the track team has traveled by airplane,
car, and bus, but there’s still something about travel
by van that creates an atmosphere unmatched
anywhere.

Van travel is still better than passenger car, but
falls short of bus or plane. But college students being
the adaptable creatures they are, find that after a few
quick trips to such exotic, locales as Onetona, New

' York (11 hours) and New Brunswick (13 hours in bad

weather), the ride can be quite tolerable, if not at
times comfortable. ,

SPACE-the final frontier, particularly so in a van.
Forget worrying about the length of the trip, who
cares if the heater doesn’t work, the main concern of
any veteran van occupant will be whether or not
there’s enough room in the vehicle to‘ breathe. For
want of elbow room, the women’s track team has a
rule that team members may only bring one travel
bag, this saves the baggage space for more important

On the Run

By MARIA SCIULLO

 

With fewer folks on the team this season, space has
been readily available, but that wasn’t the case last
year. A typical conversation from the 1979 season
might have included “Gwen,_will you please move
your foot so I can reach my shoes without waking up
Brenda?...Melanie, please trade places with me for a
couple of hours so I can sleep on the floor.”

. SLEEP-another major concern. Most van travel is
done at night. Obviously, without lights studying is

irnpossible,‘ so the alternatives are talking and
.,;'.;;s.leeping.

Falling asleep while speeding down_the
‘interstate can be a real challenge. This is particularly

' true if the van’s shock absorbers aren’t in great shape
and the floor registers are churning forth cold,

highway air-which is often the case.

To make sleep a little easier, pillows and blankets '

are piled, wrapped and folded throughout the van.
One sleeping bag is worth at least three blankets any

College Sports Best Way to Learn Ad-van-tages of   Travel  .  

DINING-The average trip includes two or three A,
rest stops, where purchase of all sorts of junk foods
ranging from HoJo’s ice cream to cans of Coke is
inevitable. It is also ridiculously expensive when
you've been on the road over six hours, food can
break up the monotony. Fortunately, the coaches
always bring along bags of apples or oranges, so
nutritionally speaking, all is not lost to the junk food
jungle. F
ENTERTAINMENT--Usually, vans come equipped
with AM/FM radios, which is fine until you hit the
road 156 miles outside the nearest town.’When the
signal grows faint and songs run together, the
cassette players come out; Until then, the radio is a
constant source of aggrevation as well as listening
pleasure. This is because of the speakers location in
the front and back of the van. When the radio is
played at normal level (in the driver’s opinion), the’
rear speakers deafen whomever is sitting in the back
seat. When lowered to accomodate those back-seat
listeners, the music is not always audible up front.

The AM/ FM radio has taught many a Pittathlete L , -
- patience and diplomacy. '

So there you haveit. The destinations remain the
same, but the personel and methods of coping with
being cooped up in a van are a little different. ‘

 Injury-PIaguedGymnasts Meet ‘Different’CIarionTonight

By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Staffwriter

2 Injuries will be the name of the

5  game tonight when Pitt's men’s

and women’s gymnastics teams do
battle—-the Pantherettes against
Clarion State and the men against
Temple. M

Pitt coach Donna Sanft said the
loss of juniors Bonnie Tressler and
Myra Bachuchin, out all season

'_ with injuries, has hurt the team.

_ Holly Martino, Roxanne Evans,

' Babbie Flock and Gretchen Speich
will be starting for the Pantherettes
in the all-around competition.

“They’ve (Clarion State) been
scoring in the 120s so far this year,
which isn’t bad,” said Sanft,
-“And, considering the circum-
’-stances, their new coach really has
done a fairly good job.”

The Clarion State , team, once
considered"the top collegiate team
in the nation, experienced a
setback in August when its coach
resigned to accept a position at the
University of Florida. With her
resignation came the transfer of all
Clarion returners with the except~ '
ion of one girl.

Sanft said her team is coming ‘off
two bad meets against Eastern
Michigan and »Michigan' State and
has been plagued with many
injuries in recent weeks. ‘

‘ ‘It’s going to take a lot of pulling ‘
together because we’re not going p

with‘ a full team, but we’ll be
shooting for a 134, if we can,”
Sanft said. .

Men’s coach Frank D’Amico said
approximately 80 percent of his
squad is hampered by some type of
injury. . J‘

D‘Amico said he will be relying
on the efforts of his top performers,
