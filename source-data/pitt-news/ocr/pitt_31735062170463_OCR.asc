CAS Cabinet Denies
ROTCCreclit Review

‘ _ by JOHN A. CAPITMAN

The CAS Cabinet voted down
Thursday. by a margin of 37 to
nine iwith three abstentionsi. a
proposal by the Army and Air
Force ROTC programs that their
courses go before the CAS Council
for review with the end of grant-
ing them credit. .

Ron Eskin./a Pitt senior and
head of the Cabinet. explained.
"What this means is that the
ROTC proposal for credit review

by the CAS and FASC9Councils.'

‘ will probably. not even be con-

sidered."

A}-sq. Eskin went oni to explain that
‘ithelreport includes the positions

,I

of both minority and majority in
regard to ROTC accredidation,
“because of the nature of the Cab-
inet, which at present coiildbe
controlled by the most numerous

" special interest group and re-

_ quires presentations of both sides‘

\O'v-

of the issue.

The information for stating the
positions will come from four
Cabinet meetings and the series
of public hearings that have been
held to discuss the credit propos-
al. as well as from the positions
that were stated from the floor on
Thursday evening.

Thursday .night's meeting of
the Student Affairs Advisory
Council (SAACi centered its at-
tention on clarifying security is-
sues which have sparked the stu-
dents‘ concern. .

Against a background of what
many students felt was a "rash of
crime" in the area. news of a re-
scheduling of orders for campus

"policemen caused a flurry of pe-
titioning. statistic compilation.
and meeting scheduling.

Director of Student Activities
Bill Markus, acting in the absence
of Dr. Alfred Moye, Dean of Stu-
dent, Affairs, called the meeting
an “information-giving”
which would detail the interim ac-
tivity among specific groups.

The members of the SAAC heard

Vice Chancellor of Operations Jo-V

seph Duttoii blame the concern
partly on a lack of "open lines of
communication" between stud-
;_l_ents and administration.

‘iJoseph Gil. Superintendent of_

the University Police Depart-
ment. described the wave of con-
cern as caused by "people deal-
ing with truths. half-truths. and
untruths. which perhaps brought
a sense of paranoia to some." In
the past few weeks. he said. an ar-
ray of statistics have been pre-
sented about the crime iiate.
Refering to a set of such fig-
ures collected by the Legal

Awareness Committee (LAC), Gil ‘

charged that they were “not law-

fully obtained from my office.”

LAC. later defendedthe validity

The public hearings were held
from 3 to 4 pm; in Room 520 of
the Student Union on Tuesday.
Wednesday. and Thursday of last
week. and were. as Eskin explain-
ed. "attended mostly by people
taking ROTC. because they are
the most concerned with the ques-

,. tion of credit for these courses."

The “pro-credit” position\ in-
cludes the following points. First,
the belief that ROTC courses are
just like, and just,‘ as good as,
other courses in the College, such
as history or political science.
Secondly,-

Students Often Unaware -of Obligations

a Commissioner iWarns

Insurance‘ Commissioner ller-
bert S. Deiienberg cautioned
Pennsylvania college students
against a life insurance. policy
which results in the creation of an
immediate/and irrevocable debt
obligation.

Denenberg explained that this
sales agreement—‘in which the
first years premiums- are defer-
red aiid a legally enforceable
promissory note. or loan. issued—
can result in an unwanted expense
of $300 to $400 by immediately
eliminating the possibility for re-
consideration and cancellation of
the policy.

Denenberg issued the warning
in a letter sent to the presidents
of 150 colleges, universities, and
junior colleges throughout the
Commonwealth. The letter was

. sent after the Insurance Depart-

ment received complaints from
students and parents about the
selling technique. _ -

"This type of life insurance

purchase may be a sound one for
some college -students. permit-7

ting them to receive immediate
coverage and deferring the pay-
ments until they are out of
school." Denenberg commented.

"But it is most definitely not
the type of policy which should
be bought unaware of the finan-
cial obligations it will create.“

Under this type of sales agree-

ment, Denenberg explained, ‘the
first . year’s premium. is paid
through a promissory note, as an
inducement for students to pur-
chase the. policy while still in
school." The note is not due until
after five years, provided premi-
ums for the second through fifth
years are paid. At that time, the
original amount of the promissory
note together with accumulated
interest comes due. The company
will also usually finance one or
more of the subsequent premiums
in the same fashion. However,
Denenberg cautioned‘ students
against signing more than one
promissory note ata time, noting
that the company must contact
each policyholder regarding how

The situation is very rare when
a Pitt student is able to get
through aterm without being com-_
mitted in some way to writing a
paper. Many students feel them-
selves unqualified as proficient
writers yet are obligated to cre-
ate some some kind of paper be it
anything from a two page critical
analysis or a 30 paper short story.

The English Department. aware‘

of this dilemma. established two
years ago, the English Composi-

the students with any type of writ-f C

Staff Revamps Format to

by JANE HENDERSON

Ideas and Figures Pitt's literary
magazine, is endeavoring to set
up a new image this year. The
new focus is on making the maga-

zine represent all of the Univer-

sity. not just the staff itself.

According to co-editor Karl
Baldys. “We will try to get a
cross-sectional representation from
all groups and styles of stu-
dents,“

By getting a varied set of view
points, the staff hopes to give the‘
magazine more breadth and depty
than it has had in the past. Prose,
poetry, or photography contribu-
tions need not be exclusively from
undergraduates or even from uni-
versity personnel, although the
former will get thefirst priority. _

“Our purpose I is to promote
the arts—to keep the art commun-
ity alive. It doesn't have the'aud-
ience it used to have, but it’s worth
struggling for to keep it alive,”'
added co-editor Jim Rethi.

In the pursuit of promoting
the arts. the magazine's staff
will be distributing the publi-
cation all over the Pittsburgh
area. Besided helpingto publi-
cize the magazine itself. this ef-
fort may recruit new staff mem-
bers from the surrounding areas.

Ideas and Figures is also going
to sponsor an arts contest. In each
of four areas—photography, graph-
ics, prose, and poetry-there will
be a cash first prize. The top
three winners will be published in
the next issue of the magazine,
which comes out in January. All
entries are due in the Ideas and
Figures office in 416 Schenley
Hall by November 30.’

Presently the magazine has a
staff of about 21. Baldys explained

that they are always recruiting new 1

staff members. Recruiting is cur-
rently being directed to-English
classes and the Studio Arts de-
partment, but all students are
welcome to join.

“The public has been screwed long enough"

Monday, October 30,

Denenberg Calls Government Consumer Fraud

. , by MIKE MILLER

Pennsylvania Insurance Com-
sioner Herbert Denenberg has
been dubbed. "The Ralph Nader
of the Insurance Business." and
legend has it that. on the golf
course. insurance executives sub-
stitute his name for the tradition-
al four letter epithets.

Denenberg. however. accepts
no substitutes in his language
when blastingiany institution
which. in his opinion. does not
measure up. '

He sports a button inscribed
with his Latin motto, “Populus
Iandudum Defutatus Est,” which
translates, “The Public Has Been
Screwed Long Enough.”

The BBC is doing a special on
Denenberg and his encounter with
Blue Cross entitled "The Turn of
the Screwed." Denenberg is parti-
cularly pleased with the way the
BBC is handling the affair in not
censoring his language.

"There is no synon_vm for ‘bull-
shit‘ and when you can't say bull-
shit you‘re at a disadvantage." he
laughed.

Denenberg spoke with college
reporters in Harrisburg. Frida.V~
on consumer protection in govern-
ment. . / ,
“Government is the biggest
consumer fraud in the United
States,” he said. “Government is
for sale and it goes to the highest
bidder.”

CAS Cabinet Denies
ROTC Credit Review

(Continued from Page 1)

sents one point of view that
should be heard freely. Finally,
students should make their own
life decisions, should have free-
dom of choice about what they
study, if you don’t give ROTC
credit then your penalizing the
people who are taking it, and keep-
ing other people who would lik
to take it away.” '

The majority opinion. (if those
who do not favor credit for ROTC
courses. include the following:
that ROTC.teachers and course
material are under the influence
of an outside institution and can-
not be controlled by the Universi-
ty. and that ROTC courses are

_professional training rather than

liberal education. Finally, ROTC,

at present does not have credit.
and no significant changes in
their program. or the lives of its

~ _,g,:raduate_s have taken place, that

-‘would suggest not maintaining the
status quo.

The CAS Cabinet was also ad-
dressed by Professor Samuel
Hayes. chairman of the History
Department. concerning his pro-
gram. a College of Military Sci-

ence, instead_of ROTC. The Cabi-
net was re-informed about the
motivations behind the 19.68 Fac-
ulty of Arts and Sciences decision
to not grant ROTC courses CAS
credit.

The CAS Cabinet will discuss
"changes in the course listing.
catalogue and course structure in
general" at-its next meeting to be
on Thursday evening at 7:45 in
524 Student Union.

He discussed his firebrand ap-
proach to consumer affairs. say-
ing. “The system is not respon-
sible to the consumers will. The
consumer is not well organized
and he gets clobbered.“

Denenberg is trying to organize
the consumer. especially in the

‘area of insurance. In addition to

informing citizens on insurance
pit falls. his efforts have resulted
in better witnesses at insurance
hearings.

:‘All of the insurance experts
are in the bag of the insurance
companies,” he said, stressing
the difficulty in trying to get any
qualified testimony in such mat-

. ters.

"No other government agency
is going after government as ag-
gressively as we are and that is a
sad comment." »

In consumer protection. as in
long distance running. out front is

‘a lonely place to be. Denenberg

finds little support from univer-
sities and law schools in his fight
against corrupt practices in the
insurance business.

In the campaign for no fault in-
surance he maintains‘ that “The
law schools were no help. You’d
think that they would be a bastion
of independent thought but law
school deans are afraid of shaking
up alumni.’.’

“We get very little help from
theacademic people. They're try-
ing to sell something and preserve
the system." "

To be successful. Denenberg
feels. he must be heard and aca-
demic people do him no good.

“What the hell is the good of
writing a damn article for some
damn scholarly journal,” he
fumes. The academics, he says,
don’t care if information dies in
obscure journals.

He finds the press fair but poor
in their standard of reporting.
"They're too intent on da_v to day
reporting rather than deep trend
stories." -

Deneribergs campaign to in-
form the public is carried on
through the publication of special
"shoppers guides" such as his
shoppers’ guide to insurance and
surgery as well as through the

media.

His impact, he feels, has been
fdlt directly through hearings,
etc., and indirectly through other
agencies which have been embar-
rassed into adopting his topics.

“The system is responsive if
you are organized.“ he said. “Any
ass can have impact. What we
need is people who aren‘t asses
getting organized." -

;_ foreign and domestic policies and elect him President.

I All year long, McGovern campaigned against the Nixon adminis-
:'tration, using every issue" he could think of—the Vietnam War, infla-
ion, unemployment and Watergate. This campaign struck a spark in
he primaries, as the candidates of change, McGovern and George
,3 Wallace, swept to victories. The natives were restless, and the mes-
5sage was change.

A But with only a week left in the campaign, it seems that few
{Americans are responding to McGovern’s call. Where are the forces
" of change now? Has America gone to sleep? Is nobody home?

The war went on for four years. The cities rotted. Prices, crime
,_and unemployment kept rising. Yet when Senator McGovern cries
,_ how wrong everything is, it seems that no one is listening. The Presi-
dent reassures us that everything is just fine, and America agrees.

I For this result the President can claim credit. Both candidates
judged the Americanmorality, and it appears that Nixon won.

. For instance on the issue of the war. Nixon bet that by removing
American ground troops and eliminating G.I. deaths he would
defuse the war as an issue. His strategy was to wait and get better
‘peace terms when the North Vietnamese were convinced they faced
another four years of Nixon. “ ~

T ' This strategy, however,_ required the presence of the Air Force
and I Navy to keep the pressure on the enemy. It also meant the
lives of thousands of innocent civilians, killed during this time by
our bombs. and napalm. Finally, it meant the lives of over 20,000
American soldiers while he bought this time.

' McGovern, on the other hand, believed that the American people
were disgusted not only with the American participation in the war,
but the" thousands of lives this strategy wasted. He thought the peo-
ple would buy a total, unilateral pullout.

There, in a nutshell, was the choice presented to the voters.
And their response? »

It was so apathetic that the McGovern can_didacy was all but
written off. Hanoi heard the cries “Four More Years“ and was fright-
ened that it meant ju_st that——four more years of war. They dashed
headlong to make peace, even giving a deadline of October 31st for

the agreement to be signed. The battered country couldn‘t take four
‘r'riore”years.. ‘ _ »

Domestically, too, McGovern has struck out. He made the case
for strong social change. But the country is tired. The people want
a rest from change. They had enough of efforts on behalf of the
poor and the oppressed. At the Democratic Convention, McGovern
became identified with these forces. For a full week. the television
screen was filled with McGovernites—screaming kids, blacks and
women—th;'eatening to wake America up.

 '. But the louder they screamed, the deeper the tired country
slept." Middle American voters once drawn to McGovern as a protest
candidate and a defender of the little man saw him as just another
liberal reformer. I
'  Nixon bet the country is far more conservative, anti-Negro
and anti-welfare. Again he is winning the bet. McGovern was
painted with a radical brush. Now every time America is tempted
to look at George McGovern, they see the radical stripes and turn’
way. Sh-h-h. Don’t look, '
} Sleeping people, like sleeping dogs, don’t like to be disturbed.
-That’s why we listen when the President says that everything is all
‘right. It’s not that George McGovern is lacking in ability or
l'f"chara‘cter, but he is crying for changes that most people don’t like
at a time when all they want is some peace and quiet. ' .
_ Quiet. so they can sleepv.,SH-h-h, George. Go Away. There’s
nobody home. I

Letters to the Editor

Dear Editor

We feel that the current proposal
for increasing the size of the cam-
pus security force is another ex-
ample of racism at the university.
Although the campus police are '
supposed to protect both the stu-
dents and university property.
what is really happening in prac-
tice is that they are keeping the
surrounding community (in par-
ticular black workers and students)
away from the campus that the
labor and taxes of the community
have built. A black, woman recent-
ly complained in the University
Times about harassment from cam-
pus security when she brought her
children over to Trees Hall to use
the swimming pool. A black stu-
dent at Pitt was followed as he
entered the Cathedral of Learning
by campus police and asked to
produce his ID; when he asked

-why he was being followed» the
reply was "you look suspicious”

although thousands entering
the CL are not submitted to this
harassment. _

The cry for more police at Pitt
cannot be viewed in isolation._
Both the Nixon and McGovern
campaigns have stressed the issue
of “law and order" due to crime,
in the streets. In Chicago, Hanra-‘
han (murderer of Panthers) who
is backed by McGovern , big cor-
porations, have been pushing the
idea that there are groups of black
terrorists (Mau-Mau’s) roaming
the streets out to kill ‘all whites
and anyone'else who defies their
terrorist ideology. This obvious
absurdity (as well as the propa-
ganda about crime in the streets)
is being pushed to intensify racial’
divisions and fears between white
and black working people. By
doing this the real problems of
poverty, unemployment; rotten
health care. bad housing, and
racist wars of agression will be
obscured in the upsurge of race
hatred. Racism in fact. is the

main tool that the corporations -

which rule this country use. to
keep us all divided in order to
stop any movement which would
threaten their profits an'd power.
Courses and textbooks are wide-
ly used which promote ideas about
the genetic and cultural inferior-
ity of black, latin and asian peo-
ple (Banfield, Herrnstein— ’
Shockley). The present demand for
more police to protect students
fits this pattern’ of building ra-
cist fears, whether or not those
making the demand are conscious -
of it. Students and student organi-
zations should not be fooled by
this latest drive by big business
to blame minority people for the
problems that the capitalist sys-
tem is responsible for.

Naturally. the recent crimesthat
have been publicized““so much"are
a serious matter—-but what about
the crimes of this University
which these groups never men-i
tion. What about Pitt having al-
most 280,000 shares of Gulf Oil
stock—acompany which is mona-
tarilysupporting a vicious colon-
ial regime of the Portuguese in
Angola and Mozambique and other
regimes around the world. What
about harboring ROTC—an outfit
that supplies 85%0f the officers who
direct the genocide in Vietnam
(Medina was an ROTC graduate.)
Whatabout paying Lawrence Lee
a fat salary for 23 years while
he writes articles-calculated to
build race hatred and other di-
visions among us in the Pitts-
burgh Press. What about expand-
ing into Black communities and
then setting up police forces to
keep Black people out? The
total amount of death, rape, rob-
bery, suffering, and poverty that
comes f'rom these crimes is so
much more than the publicized

crimes that have gone around
Oakland that only
..igno‘rarice could make us. be more

liberatedf,’ .
 the overt sexism of this remark‘.-"I“

racism or ;

concerned about getting more
cops on campus.

The only way to put an end to
crimes on campus is for the're to
be unity between students. cam-
pus employees, and community
people against such crimes. It
is well known that police often
increase crime by ignoring the
drug trade or participating in it.
(The Sun Times ran an inter-
view with an L.A. policeman who
said he was ordered to push
dope in Watts to prevent an-
other rebellion.) The only way to
end crime once‘ and for all is to
get rid of the system that through
poverty. unemployment. drugs,
etc. gives it a perfect breeding
place—that system is capitalism.
We urge the LegalAwareness Com-
mittee and other groups to re-
consider their positions and take
a stand against racism.

on Election and Racism on No-
vember 1 at 8 p.m. in room 524

Dear Editor.

Once again the Homecoming
Queen Contest becomes a farce
due to the insincerety and ego
involvement of certain candidates.
In the first case all of. the candi-
dates should have been permitted
to submit their own pictures,
not just a few. We also 'question
why some candidates’ activities
were partially or totally omitted,
while others were elaborated upon.
Not only was this practice unfair
it was often inaccurate. Chris-
tine’ Mauro is not and has never
been President of Panhellenic
Council. It is a, shame that.she
had to resort to the beautiful “de-
siderata” in order to illustrate her
“sincere” feelings about being
a Pitt co-ed. Did she think we

would not recognize it? How in“- «

sulting to our intelligence! Too
bad the voting is over! ! !

Name Withheld Upon Request

To the Editor: ,

In an article in The Pitt News
of Oct. 20, John Metcalfe discus-
sed the difficulties ofhitchhiking
in and around the Oakland area. In

/an attempt to verify his use of the

pronoun “he“ to describe drivers,
he stated, “The ladies never stop
for my thumb. Perhaps they’re not
While — I ‘protest

   

/_ .~ .
.‘, .1,

 

feel more importantly that this
weak attempt at catchy journal-
ism is an easy way of glossing
over the very real plight of the
woman as hitchhiker and ride-
giver. '

Hitchhiking._ defined for men
as a way to travel free of charge
from point A to point B. is for
women a lesson on how to lie. el-
bow, and jump out of a moving
car. The latter is especially help-
ful when having gotten into a car
driven by a dignified looking bus-
inessman, one is greeted by a dash-
board plastered with pictures of
sexual organs and the words "Wo-
men hitchhikes Beware." I per-
sonally stopped picking up men
hitchhikers after the time I pick-
ed up two “freaks" at Pitt and
was ordered to take them to their
destination because one said he

had a gun in his pocket. Another g

common occurrence is to stop
for one man and have five people
pop out from behind a tree and
jump into the car.

Usually the indignities suffered
by women hitchhikers are no worse
than those in everyday life such
as condescending remarks and a
various assortment of proposals.
Those experiences that do not end
so happily can be read about in
the newspapers and police re-
ports almost daily.

After many discussions with
friends who have has similar dis-
tasteful experiences, I have come
up with some preventive meas-
ures which I strictly abide by:
1) Take the bus. 2) Never get into
a car with more than one man.
3) If you are driving, don’t pick
up more than one man. 4) Always
ask the person where he is going.
If‘ the reply is anything but a
straight answer (i.e. "Anywhere
y_ou’re going") don't get intothe
car. Saying “Thanks, but I’m not
going that way”, is a polite way
of refusing a ride with someone
who looks shady. 5) If the situa-
tion seems threatening in . any
way, don’t hesitate to jump out
at the next light.

Above all. women pick up wo-
men!

Jane Freund CAS’

Editor's. Note: Members of Edu-
cation lOl submitted this letter
to Senator George McGovern
and President Richard Nixon in an
attempt to encourage a personal
debate. In lieu of this they would
like a representative of the candi-
dates to debate. —

Dear Sirs:

We the students of several under-
graduate education classes at the
University of Pittsburgh are

concerned about the apparentapathy

shown at our University and
throughout the United States over
the 1972 Presidential campaign.
We believe that, in large part, this
has occurred- because the two
presidential candidates have not
publicly debated the campaign
issues. Therefore, we are appeal-
ing to President Nixon and Sena-
tor McGovern to publicly appear
in such a debate.

We realize that both candidates‘;

are extremely busy in these clos-
ing weeks of the campaign: never-
theless, we think that a public de-
bate ‘between the two would
help to_ significantly reduce what
appears to be public apathy in
this campaign "and help to illum-
inate the critical social and po-
litical issues of our day.

Consequently, through our
instructors we have taken the ,
initiative to reserve a large
auditorium at the University of
Pittsburgh for such a debate.
That facility is reserved for Mon- .
day, October 30 from 12 noon un-
til 2 p.m. We realize, of course,

saying that present records are
better than past ones. Before, he
said, many crimes went unreport-
ed until the department set about
encouraging that everyone, how-
ever slight, be turned in.

Gil then explained the resched-
uling of police as a step toward
"protecting people rather than
buildings. We contend the beat
man is of the highest priority, not
the lowest."

He further stressed that the
size of the police force is not to be
cut. “We are not in the business
of reducing the police to save
money, but merely in the process
of deploying men to larger areas
through an extended beat system.”

A charge by several student

Gil Slams Critics

leaders that many of the police-
men were “bad” officers brought
Gil to define the nature of the jobs
involved.

“Our experience has proven
that the best officer is the busiest
. . . they have human failings when
given the opportunity.” Gil said
rescheduling was designed to take
those officers in “stagnant” areas
and convert wasted time into add-
ed security. a

After briefly sketching the his-
tory of the University Police.
their changing role with relation
to both students and city police.
Chancellor Wesley Posvar called
for “establishment of better in-
put from students who can tell us
something, a knowledge which
management does not possess.“

Russian-Jewish Poet
Presents Lofesf Works

by KATHY STACKHOUSE

Joseph Brodsky. Russtan—Jew—
ish poet. read selections from his
own writings Saturday evening in
the Frick Fine Arts Auditorium.
Brodsky is currentl_v poet—in-resi-
dence at the Universit_y of Michi-

gan at Ann Arbor.

Born in Leningrad in 1940. Brod-
sky began writing poetr_y at 18.
In 1964. he was sentenced to five
years hard labor for "social para-
sitism.“ He served 16 months of
his term in the Archangelsk re-
gion of Northern Russia.

In June, 1972, he entered invol-
untary exile from the Soviet Un-
ion, and after a brief stay‘ in Eur-
ope, came to the United States.

Brodsky read several poems
from his latest collection. A Halt
in the Desert. The peoms were
representative of his deep inter-
est in mythological themes and
religious philosophy.

Dr. Arcadi Nebolsine of the
Slavic Department gave a few
opening remarks on Brodsky's
poetry. He and Dr. Marcia Landy
of the English Department read
translations of Brodskys poetry
written by George Kline of Bryn
Mawr College.

The reading was jointly spon-
sored by the International Poe-
try Forum. the Department of
Slavic Languages and Literatures.
the Committee on Russian and
East European Studies. and the
Comparative Literature Program.

Mandel’s New Album Reviewed

“ThefSnoke"

by STEVE LUBETSKY

Listeners beware. For out from
Harvey Mandel‘s crafty guitar
comes The Snake to twist its body
around your mind.

Do not panic. however. For its
origin is froma friendly breed of
vipers. Essentially. its mission
is to guide you on a pleasant and
memorable musical journey.

The album is appropriately ti-
tled, for as a snake inches its way
along earth, Harvey Mandel’s
melodic guitar weaving slowly
but surely penetrates the listen-
er’s consciousness. Compositions
such as “Pegusus,” “Lynda
Love,” “Peruvian Flake,” and
“The Snake,” the title track,
speak for Mandel’s brilliance as
an imaginative blues guitarist.

An aspect which makes this al-
bum so unique is that it is the first
one Mandel has recorded on which
he sings. Boogie-woogie oriented
"L'no lno“ features him in his
debut as a vocalist. Although he's
a much better guitarist than he is
a singer. his first attempt is’none-
theless satisfactory.

Mandel appears in the solo_spot
on the unaccompanied “Ode to the
Owl." This cut is a delightful
country-blues arrangement on
which he displays his agility at
picking.

Appearing with Harvey are
friends such as drummer Paul
Lagos, bassist Larry Taylor, and
others too numerous to.mention.
Charles Lloyd guest stars in a
flute solo, called “Levitation,”
where he, Mandel, and organist
Kevin Burton share leads.

The outstanding numbers, "The
Divining.Rod".and "Bite the Elec-
tric Eel." feature Sugarcane Har-
ris. pioneer of modern — electric
blues violin. and respectively open
and close the album. Although his
job on these tracks basically is

j to supplement Mandel’s lead gui-

tar. he is quite able in a support-
ing role as well as on his own.
Mandell and Harris interchange
functions on Sugarcanes album
Fiddler on the Rock, on which
the former proves he is just as

“GodspeII" Met With Enthusiasm
At Carlow College Morning Mass

by VIRGINIA COOK
It will probably be a long time

before the murals of Eastern Eur— I

opean saints in St. Agnes‘ Church
on Fifth’Ave. hear or see any-
thing like they heard and saw _yes-
terday morning when the cast of
Godspell performed at Carlow
College's morning mass.

Every possible seat, every inch g

, of standing room in the spacious
church was filled by 10 o’clock
when a cast member blew a shep-
herd‘s born at the back of the
church and then chanted the fami-
liar “Prepare Ye the Way of the
Lord" in a" mellow, confident
voice. As he strode up the center
aisle. the rest of the cast. dressed
as circus clowns, danced and clap-
ped up the aisle behind him.

They were followed by the Rev.
Joseph D. Slater, Carlow College

chaplain, and four other priests’
who were to concelebrate the =

Mass.

As part of the traditional peni-
tential rite. the cast led the4con-

gregation in "We Beseech Thee. ’

Hear Us,” followed by "Day by
Day," which was sung as the
Mass prayer. At this point a wom’-
an. apparently" upset with‘ this
avant garde litury. stormed the

the cast. But the cast and the con-
gregation continued to
through the incident, and the con-
gregation applauded when the

     

sanctuary andhad to be restrain- ‘
ed by a priest and a member of '

sing _

‘$5 at éla

number was finished.

"Day by Day” was followed by
a series oftraditional scriptural
readings. The cast performed St.
matthew‘s gospel. which related
the parable of the good seed. The
cast played the seeds, as well as
the roads, rocks and ground the
seeds fell upon, and the trees that
sprang up from them. In the ser-
mon that followed. Fr. Slater
praised Godspell for portraying
Christ as a man who could laugh
and who was not afraid to act the
clown.“

“God’s foolishness,” Slater
said, “is often wiser than man’s
wisdom.” I

The congregation clapped en- J

thusiastically after the sermon.

After the traditional profession
of faith. the cast led the congre-
gation. which by this time was en-
thusiastically singing and clap-
ping along with the cast in "All
Good Gifts." The most solemn

; part of the Mass. the consecra-
tion, followed an at the end. in a '

great doxology of a faith, the cast
chanted “Long Live God.“ .

At the Kiss of Peace, members

of the congregation exchanged"

signs of friendship with the cast

V ing hands and patting children on .
the head.

During the distribution of com-
munion. a member of the cast
sang "Bless the Lord," and then

sung songs. The communion lines
—composed of nuns. grandmoth-
ers. freaks. all sizes and shapes
of children. middle-aged couples.
and students—reflected the diver-
sity of the congregation.

After communion. the cast sang
"By My Side" as the meditation
hymn. In the communion prayer
which followed, Slater asked that
"We see Thee more clearly. love
Thee more dearly. and follow
Thee more nearly. forever and
ever." Then he publicly thanked
the cast for "preaching the gos-
pel better than I ever could."

The truly joyous celebration

closed with “Light of the World." V

in 16th and 17th century folk mu-
sic. He researches early lute mu-
sic. much of which has been lying
unused on museum shelves for
300 years.

Mizrahi was at Pitt as a guest
at the Fitzy Ritz Coffeehouse Fri-
day and to give a concert Saturday
evening. An instructor at Perrer-

one of the only schools in the
country which offers a bachelors
degree in guitar. Mizrahi tries to
perform the music of the renais-
sance in an authentic fashion.

Mizrahi traveled through Eur-
ope after graduating from high
school, studying Flamenco guitar
among the gypsies and developing
an interest in lute playing and mu-
sic. Later he studied guitar under
Alire Diaz, world famous Mexican
musician. - _

Mizrahi noted that he enjoys
rock as well as classical music.

‘ECDIVIING

 

by VINCE l)iVNARDO
Sports Editor

Under almost identical condi-
tions as two years ago. the Pitt
Panther football team dropped
the seventh game of the current
season to a very lacklustre but
lucky Syracuse team, 10-6, last
Saturday.

Archbold Stadium ‘isn't one of
the modern day architectu_ral
wonders to_ begin with. but with
a day's rain it can be turned into
a disastrous football surface. It
rained Saturday and by game time
it looked like a mud pie free-for-
all instead of a football game.

Syracuse used a 24yard third
quarter field goal by Orange
placekicker Bernie Ruoff to stop
(literally) to a very convincing
3-0 lead. As usual. the Syracuse
score didn't come without a
questionable big break. Rouff,
who also does the punting for
coach Ben Schwartzwalder's
forces. was roughed while punt-
ing on a fourth and 12 situation
from hiw own 48 yard line. After
the break, Orange quarterback
Bob Woodruff led the Syracuse
to the Pitt 11, before the three
pointer.’ Woodruff completed one
of his two pass completions—he was
two for five for the afternoon-—
to Brian Hambleton for eight
yards to, set it up.

Needless to say, the slick field
conditions hurt the wide open
Pitt offense. Still, it seemed ra-
ther formidable for the Syracuse
offense to mount a serious scor-

* ing threat. It seemed that if the

Cats could score one TD the game
would be in hand.

by RON SIEGEL

.- Fumbleitis set in on the Pitt
junior varsity Friday, and it spoil-
ed an otherwise excellent per-
formance, as the Cubs went down

’ to defeat at the hands of the Kent

State Golden Flashes JV. 11-6.
Pitt fumbled a total of eight

times. and lost five of them. The

most costly fumble came with
just 25 seconds to play in -the
game. with Pitt on Kent’s one
yard line. Quarterback Don Her-
old took the snap, and in a back-
field mixup, the ball squirted
loose and the Flashes» recovered,

thus winning a game,they were

about to lose.

Offense coach Dan Lynn took
all of the blame. “I ‘blew it.”
he stated dejectedly, “I called the
right play, but I sent it in with a
guard instead of calling time
and explaining it to Herold my-
self.” ‘

Pitt only had two practice ses-
sions for the game, and the lack
of timing in the backfield was

responsible for most of the fumbles.

It was also the first time that
the Cubs had played on grass,
and this also hampered Pitt’s

-efforts.. . V

After holding Kent State on
the opening set of plays. \quarter-
back» Rich Washinko fumbled on
the first play from scrimmage
and the ‘Flashes recovered on
Pitt’s 25. Due to a stingy Pitt
defense. it took Kent 10 plays
-before quarterback. Ted Liszka
connected to his favorite target.
Willie ‘Davis. for the touch-
down.

The defense played exception-.
ally welleall game, and even‘ the
TD pass, an eight yarder, the ball.

‘ was tipped high into,'the= air but  -- -

..; «I»! . 

Pitt coach Carl DePasqua had
similar ideas and kicked to the
Orange after winning the opening
toss of the coin. Ruoff however.
kept Pitt in the hold most of the
first half with his brilliant punt-
ing. And while Syracuse couldn’t
move the ball, the Cats were pre-
occupied with starting their
drives from very deep in their
territor_y. ‘ ‘

It wasn’t until the middle of
the second quarter that they got
the ball at their own 36 yard
line. Before that, they started from
the 20 twice. from the 15. the
six. and the four yard lines.

Syracuse didn’t take advantage

of their excellent field posi-
tion.

The Panthers got what-seemed
to be a legitimate break when
defensive tackle John Robb
gobbled up a loose ball at the
SU 37. Hogan promptly hit half-'
back Bill Englert with a 24
yard pass, but threw incomplete
on a fourth and 10 situation to
end the treat. -

-It was the kind of day when
all miscues had to be taken ad-
vantage of, and the Cats failed
until there were a mere 36 sec-
onds left in the game.

- ‘ The Orangemen did. Hogan. at-

tempting to pass from his end
zone was interrupted by line-
backer Chuck Boniti at the 10.
Boniti returned itto the three
end from there Syracuse took
it in on three plays..’

With 8:44 left in the game,
the issue was settled.$a

The Orangemen lost the statis-
tic battle despite the win. They

unluckily came down in Davis’

Many’Pitt players had outstand-
ing performances. but perhaps
the best was turned in by defen-
sive back ‘Chuck Bonasorte,
who was time after time making

- unassisted open-field tackles. as

well as joining -the rest "of the
defensive secondary in limiting
Liszka to 7 of 18 completions. for
a total of only 44 yards. Bona-
sorte also picked off one of Lisz-
ka’spasses. . ,_ .
Following a scoreless second
period. Pitt took the ball 80
yards on 14 plays to narrow the
score to 8-6. A on Herold pass
to Doug Bolognese of 25 yards.
and a 14 yard run by Ted Ber-
rein set up the score, with Rich
Washinko. taking it infrom the
one. A two-point conversion try
failed when Washinko fumbled.

Marstellar was chidingly ac- ,

cused of stealing a touchdown
from Fry, ‘afterwards in the
team bus, but other than that the
party atmosphere was not there.
A few players were upset about
the frequently flying penalty
flags—most of which went against
them.

“Both teams had to face the
same field condiditon." Carl
DePasqua said a.fterward. "It's
hard to judge a team’s perform-
ance under these conditions and
what can I say about the offici-
ating that will change the score‘?

Judging from the tone of his
voice, it didn’t seem like DePas-
qua was having a lot of fun on
this his 40th birthday.

Herold pass was intercepted by
Dale Roper, who returned it to

defense held firm,‘ and Kent

conceded coach Steve Petro,” But
they weren‘t better than us in

any way," ‘he quickly added.

"They just had more practice."

Kent State head coach Skip
Hall admitted that his team prac-
ticed for the game more than Pitt
did, but still felt that his team
deserved to win. "Weicame up
with a big play.yvhen we had our
books against the wall.”

The game marked the end of 1

Boaters Rally
  To Beat Scots 

by- BART MACK

Some special strategy applied to a rain drenched field helped
Edinboro State give the Pitt Soccer Team a good score before Pitt
rallied _to down the Scots by a 5-1 score. The win is the third foi‘..th'é'j
booters in West Penn Conference competition. ‘ V » .‘ ~ ' 7

The Edinboro field. a natural grass turf. had received jaisolidj
drenching on Friday night and. at game time on Saturday. one end-
of the field_ was spotted with large puddles. After winning the pre.
game toss. Coach Leo. Bemis instructed the Pitt captains to taketh A
option of defending the dry end of the playing surface in the ,fi_rs_t
halfs. . ' 
That strategy on the part of Coach Bemis almost backfired at
halftime as the Scots held a 1-0 lead after-. the first fra_me.~The
soggy footing. along with a rash of mistakes, held Pitt off -the score-
board while Edinboro used the dry area for their offense to supply
the team with plenty of momentum. " V ‘ . '

“We just made all kind of mistakes in the first half,” ’Bemis‘la'-
mented. “We weren’t able to trap the ball on the wet field‘and,wé
were kicking the ball right to th_em.”' -r '  - ' V

Another factor that might have hampered the booters is the fact
that they switched to a new formation for the Edinboro contest only
a week before. Pitt played in a 4-3-3 for the first time this se'asoI_i
and Bemis had to juggle some playersto make it effectively_.’ The
Scots were able to penetrate a_ usually stingy Pitt defense at abou

The second half turned out to be a different story. however. I
the Pitt offense began to click. It took 16 minutes for Joe Lux?
bacher to" tie things up "with his seventh goal of the yeai'.?Althou§h
Luxbacher did not enjoy/such a prolific game with the Scots ashe
did last year. the senior forward did pick up two more “goals: on
Saturday for his second hat trick of the campaign. : ‘ ' " . 

Kohlmeyer, moved from his defensive position to a halfback spot-,.
took a beautiful setup fromLuxbacher to find the back of the nets.’
Luxbacher had the ball directly in front of the Edinboro net’ and:
backpassed to the onrushing Kohlmeyer who blased it by the goalie. r '

Luxbacher continued his assault on the Scots with another‘V-tally
as Pitt continued to pour on the pressure. Fernando Carriquiry. an-
other fullback moved up to the offense. provided Pitt with even more
insurance with his first goal of the seasonf Carriquiry. who is one of
the best headers on the team. was placed in front of the Scots’ net for
a cornerkick and he displaced his talents with an acrobatic effo_rt:l_to
beat the Edinboro goaltender.. . " f 

Luxbacher pumped in his final score of the afternoon to com-
plete the booter’s rally. Ray Rex, the second leading scorer onV the
squad. collected two assists for his days work. r ’ " '

The loss was only the second for the Scots and "Bemis lauded
them for their efforts saying, “They were really psyched upforus.
They had the pressure on and if they could have stuck in a couple
of goals they would have had us.” ‘ ' '- 4'

Bemis also recognized his own team’s failure ‘to fold under
the Edinboro attack when he said. “This was a really big win for.
us to be down and come back with five goals. They were. a good‘
team, as big as we were. ' V "I

"Bill Haines had some real good saves and so did the f‘ullbacks,1\l.
Bemis added. "Fernando made a beautiful play to head one goal in." V 

The win now gives the booters a record of 4-3-1 overall,‘- and’:-.‘

ance College for the league lead even though Alliance boasts .a 7-0
record. The championship of the circuit is determined by win_ning.__,
percentage and not the number of victories, so Pitt is definitely,,in“
the running to defend its crown._ . I

in the varsity race. Collins. Steele.
and Martin of Pitt received indi-
vidual medals.

“Overall I was satisfied,” said
Don Mollenhaur.

"We did substantially better
than at the West Virginia and Kent
State meets.“ he continued.

Making a couple of tactical mis-
takes. the team lost on the fourth
and fifth positions.

“We’ve got to get the top five
scoring runners closer together,”
commented Coach Mollenhaur.

Everyone competed in the meet
even though earlier in the week
Schurko and John Black were
doubtfuls due to injuries.

While it is hard to .,tell who your
competition is befote the meet.
after the meet Coach Mollenhaur
said. “The field was stronger than
last year both as a team and in-
dividual runners. Especially up
front. it was a strong. well bal-
anced field.

“We’ve been improving, but we-

still have a long way to go,” com-
mented Coach Mollenhaur.

V This Friday the harriers will
travel to Syracuse, N. Y.. for the
Big Four. Hopefully the team will

. continue to improve.

Tnc Or-Treat
, On Gridiron?

Every year at the end of October. young tots and not so _young tots
are getting ready to go out in the street to collect candy on Halloween
weekend, candy selling supermarkets and costume shops make their
big pitch to financial success. and the Pitt Panthers play the Syracuse
Orangemen in a footbalpgame. '

This year was no different—as far as the Pitt/Syracuse game was
concerned.

Halloween. unlike football games. is associated with hobgobblins
and spookery. which tantilizes the minds of not yet mature youngsters.’
Yet, one has to wonder if the chicanery associated with the suspenseful
October evening can't be associated with a football game.

Pitt gridder John Moss,.who has been out with an injury since the
first game of the season, made the trip to Syracuse as a spectator. But
it was strange that of all the players going on the trip, Moss was the
13th one to board the team bus.

Pitt hasn’t beaten the Orange Indians at Archbold Stadium since
1960, 13' years. After Syracuse won the most recent game of the his-
toric matchup, the all-time win/‘loss record stands at 13-13-2 for both

' teams. Even a local Syracuse sportscaster got into the unlucky number

act when he prediced the score to be 13-6 in favor of the locals. if it
rained. ‘ , _ I
, And, it always rains when Pitt plays the Oranges.

Spooky? V '

Sane people aren’t supposed to believe in this mythodical garbage.
but does the Syracuse Indian dofa rain dance when the Panthers are
slated to arrive? Why do the big bad Schartzwalder boys wear brigh
orange uniforms on such a day? -

And though no witches were seen flying over Archbold Stadium.
one has to wonder why Syracuse always gets a .treat playing Pitt in their
backyardf- _

Friday night on the Syracuse campus, the setting was festive. A
lot of people were walking around in appropriate dress and ‘one dolt
was wearing a pumpkin over his head, carrying a sing, proclaiming he
was Richard Nixon. -

With -the football game in progress. the Parithers seemed to be
chased by a bunch of trick-or-treaters, demanding a victory, or_else.
And, there was one report that the New Yorkers had candles burning in
their jack-0-lantern like helmets. Was it fire intheir eyes.

The Panthers weren’t taking any chances, however. Along with a

' crew of co-operating officials, they did their best to avoid being trick-

ed. They treated Syracuse to their fourth win of the season, instead.
