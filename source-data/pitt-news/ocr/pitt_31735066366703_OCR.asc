New Operation Match  
Questionnaires Ready
For Students Monday

Operation Match question-
naires will again be available
to University students. The
forms will be distributed
starting next Monday at stu-
dent desks in the Cathedral and
the Student Union, and in the
dormitories. They will also be
distributed to the fraternity and
sorority houses.

Mike Ranck of Delta Tau Del-
ta fraternity will be University
coordinator for the project. Any
questions about Match will be
answered by Ranck at his house,
682-9254.

Operation Match is a computer-
ized process, created by a Har-
vard University junior and
friends, whereby young people
all over the country between 17
and 27 fill out lengthy question-
naires about themselves and their
ideal date. After paying three
dollars they receive the names of
ﬁve members of the opposite sex
in their area whom they may call
for dates. Based on the informa-
tion and speciﬁcations each stu-
dent supplies to Operation Match,‘
the list he receives will contain
names of persons with tastes and
traits as similar or dissimilar to
themselves as they desire.

This time, the questionnaires
have been revised and reﬁned to
correct-some of the errors and
disadvantages which arose dur-
ing the lastperiod.

The experiment has also spread
to Great Britain by means of two

British students who spent last
year at Harvard. They have ac-

Jose Limon
Dances Here

 This Week

Jose Limon, a prominent per-
former and choreographer of
modern “expressionist dance,"
will conduct a dance lecture dem-
onstration Thursday at 8 p.m. in
Trees Hall. Tickets are $2 per
person.

Once an instructor at the Uni-
versity, Limon taught Margaret
E. Covert and Dr. Karl E. Oer-
mann, now University professors
of physical education.

Born in Mexico, Limon began
studying dance at age 20, under
the guidance of Doris Humphrey,
an originator of modern dance
in America. Subsequently, he be--
gan a career which has brought
him numerous awards, such as
the Capezio Award for outstand-
ing dance.

At 58, Limon continues to per-
form and tour with his company.
He has been to Europe and Asia
and, while home, teaches at the
Connecticut College summer
workshop for dance.

quired the British rights to the
project for the next ten years.
The system will remain basically
the same in England except for
some obvious changes.

Students in England will be
charged one pound for the serv-
ice, or about $2.85. The organ-
izers face a high cost of compu-
ter use and are considering send-
ing the work to America, where
the cost is almost half.

Open Hearings To Be Held

By LINDA GOLDSTEIN
(Sec Etlitorial Pu;/<* 4.)

Hearings will be held
shortly to determine what
policy should prevail in re-
gard to :Men’s Dorm Coun-
cil’s (MDC) lobby rules. The
decision to hold hearings on-
MDC’s policies, which was initi-
ated by the debate over litera-
ture distribution in the dormi-
tories during the recent Student
Government (SG) election, was
passed by the Towers Quadrangle
Committee at its Monday meet-
ing.

Vice-Chancellor of Student Af-
fairs Helen P. Rush presented a
proposal whereby a committee to
study the rules should be estab-
lished with the following repre-
sentatives: Mrs. Erma Meyerson,
professor of social work; Dean
of Men Herbert McGibbeny; Dean
of Women Savina S. Skewis; Da-

On Merits Of MD  le

,vid M. Cohen, professor in the

University’s Law School;' and
two impartial students.

Harvey Lefton, president of
MDC, brought up the point that
the committee should be com-
posed of the students directly in-
volved in the rules conﬂict. He‘

proposed that the committee in-
clude two representatives of
MDC; two SG senators; the presi-
dent of MDC; the president of
SG; a representative of the wom-
en’s housing area; and Dr. David
Cohen, who would act as legal
adviser to the group.

Lefton’s reasoning behind his
proposal, which passed by a vote
of 8-5-1, was that there should be
an opportunity to “cement rela-
tions between MDC and SG and
to clear up past animosities. The
conﬂicts between the two groups
should be eliminated.”

The Towers Quadrangle Com-
mittee will act on the report of
this subcommittee, which plans
to schedule hearings in the next
few weeks, according to Lefton.
“We want to be as fair as possible
in giving everyone a chance to
disagree before the committee,”
Lefton emphasized.

In the interim, the MDC rules
have ‘not been suspended. be-
cause ‘the Committee “didn’t
know when the hearings would
be held,” Lefton added.

Representatives at the Towers
Quadrangle m e e t i n g included
John Vrana, who served as acting
chairman in the absence of Vice-

Service Project

  Greeks Cnsider Blood Donation

QUEEN CANDIDATES ﬁrst row: Carolyn Szolis,
Carrie Lightholder, Denny Rinovato, Lin Perkins,
Linda Tyson, Kay Shenesky, Nancy Greensfelder,
Barbara Beam; second row: Judy Gross, Bev Keller,

A Blood Donor~Club is one
of the projects under consid-
eration for the 1966 Greek
Week, March 7-12. If the
idea goes through, according
to Greek Week Chairman Jim
Smith, each fraternity and soror-
ity will be asked to have ten
members donate blood on a des-
ignated day during that week.
Points for the service project

will be given toward the overall
Greek Week trophy.

The 25 per cent increase in the
number of Greeks at the Univer-
sity, bringing the total to 1,200,
and the increase in Greek Week
ticket price from $5.50 to $6 will
mean increased funds for the
_week’s activities. The additional

money will be used for favors, to
make the Awards Dinner free,
and to buy better trophies, ac-
cording to Smith. The Greeks will
donate $l0O'of the money to the

‘Stanton Crawford Memorial Book

Fund.

Greek Week’s schedule begins
with the chariot race at noon
March 7 and Fun Night that eve-
ning. Smith has requested that
each‘ fraternity and sorority take
their choice of group to work
with on the Chariot race and Fun
Night to the Dean of Men’s of-
fice. He expects Fun Night to be
“a much bigger attraction than
ever before.”

March 8 will be the day of the
Service Project. Greek Sing, with
its theme “This Wonderful Year;-’ -

Nancy Solimine, Marlene Touger, Liz Troy, Su-
zanne Townsend, Lynn Yarrington, Adrienne San-
za; third row: Betty Black, Janet Berson, Beth
Furst, Juday Martin, Joyce Stoehr, Lynn Williams.

will be held March 9. Each group
will sing a song from a different
year.

The Awards Dinner will take
place March 9. Smith estimates
that the first 350 people who sign
up will be able to attend.

Count Basie wi1l‘not be playing
for the formal dance at Church-
ill Valley Country Club March
10 as previously announced. He
was forced to cancel his contract"
here because of an extended con-
tract with Frank Sinatra in Mi-
ami. The Greek Week Committee

.plans to hire a local band in-

stead. ‘

Ramsey Lewis and his Trio and
the Bitter End Singers will enter-
tain at the concert March 11.

Offered For
Asia ; Studies

Because a lack of Americans
who speak Asian languages has
long hampered U.S. diplomatic
efforts in Asia, the East-West
Center in Honolulu is offering
100 full-expense scholarships an-
nually to Americans interested in
studying one of the languages of
Asia.

These students will study at
the University of Hawaii with
uhich the Center is affiliated.
The Center has its own dormi-
tories and American students are
paired with Asians to encourage
East-West cultural interchange.

These scholarships enable grad-

.uate students to complete their
masters degree in any field relat-
ing to Asia such as Asian art,
religion,—tropical-agriculture,-phil-
osophy, history, or political sci-
ence. 2

Qualiﬁed students may com-
plete research and polish their
language during a semester in
Asia. Normally this’ﬁeld study
occurs during the third semester
of the grant.

Complete scholarship informa-
tion ‘may be obtained from the
Director of Student Selection,

I S: F Stories

The Pitt News review of Ideas
and Figures, Feb. 14, should have
read: I ‘
Ann Stern’s story, “Resurrec-
tion,” and_Dave L. Murray’s “Dis-
cipline \‘All Around,”, are two
seemingly ﬁne short stories.

A young girlsin “Resurrection,”

apparently unable to fully cope,

with her brother’s death, invents
“Carney,” a creature/friend (?)
who‘has died and lies in a box.
She enlists the aid of a child-
like Negro to pray at the burial,
but then decides that Carney is
not really dead. She can still
“talk” to him. Death suddenly
loses its horrible ﬁnality and
strangeness.

Her feelings are fully.illus—
trated in the line, “Wonder if
Carney went to heaven while she
was dead. If she did ah kin ask

her if she saw Jimmy there." At.

this point, the story might have
ended. Instead, a paragraph of
symbolism is added, unneeded
and anti~climatic.

Perhaps the most lucid story,

’ “Discipline _All Around,” has the

best ending; to say the least, it
satisﬁes the reader.

head adviser (Sherwood Lingen-

felder), the assistant dean (Dr.

Norman Mulgrave), and the dean
(Dr. James Kehl). If you don’t
(or I should say, since you never
have) there will never be" any

means by which neglect of stu- .

dents by their advisers can be
checked. Granted you get run
around, but from what I’ve seen,
you ask for it. You don’t have to
take “no” for an answer. At pres-
ent there are no rewards for
“good” advisers, no punishments
for “bad” ones. ’

The advising center is not: re-

sponsible for times courses. are
offered (departments choose
them); times you get (we do our
best, but Student Records can
change times at will; your only
insurance is a special schedule
request—not early registration);
requirements for a degree (you
may observe that in the changes
being made now, the advisers
have not put in a single word;
edgewise even). 

Remember: you may know
more than your adviser; you al-
most certainly can, if you check
into things. Secretaries are about
as‘ reliable as the campus bus as
far as information is concerned.

Once you have done something
about the lower board of ad-
visers, then you can turn your

attention to the upper board—,

many of whose advisers "have
had their position foisted upon

_them will—they nill—they.

Don't forget that there are
many changes being made re-
garding probation, repeating

_ courses, grade average, distribu-

tion, et alii. Many of these things
will be put in the bulletin for
next year, and there's no excuse
for your not reading this on your
own and clarifying any points
you aren’t sure of.

In closing let me say, you
never need apologize for taking
up your adviser‘s time( short of
your tenth visit in one term) as
he is paid good money to see to
your academic well-being. S

If you don’t like it: complain!

Surely the director of .men’s housing should possess sufficient au-
thority and competence to represent an administrative outlook in his ﬁeld
of administration. It is not necessary to have nine other student affairs
administrators reinforce the same View so. as to’ give a feeling of mutual‘
support to one another. — A . e

If a man is appointed to an administrative position, the Vice-Chan-
cellor of Student Affairs should have enough conﬁdence in him to feel he
will not deviate radically from University policy. A committee of eight
other adminisrtrators in student affairs should not be necessary to make
sure an administrator follows the office of Student Affairs’ viewpoint.

_ The subcommittee should be made a committee with the addition of e
the (li1'e("€o1' of men’s housing. The Quadrangle committee should notﬂbe
hovering over the committee, giving theimpression of "judges waiting‘-to
review. Not only does the current arrangement show lack of confidence in
students, and individual student affairs’ administrators, but bogs down the
issues in an entanglement of unnecessary committeework. ,

Such a committeecould serve, with some modifications, for review of
anydormitory policies. -One administrator from the. field of interest is
‘enough, plus a legal consultant, a set of permanentlstudent representatives,
and a strong emphasis on open hearings.

Spring 1966 . i - . a S
I Slim Pickings
A ‘ ~ by Marsha Rehns

‘ “The trimester has failed dismally to appeal to undergraduate
students.” tWith this statement the Ford Foundation report summed
up the “major ./contributor” to the University’s ﬁnancial crisis. Since’
the inception of the trimester in 1960, the report explains, the spring
trimester has not attracted enough students (as compared to regular
summer programs) to warrant the extra cost of year-round operation.

Much of the failure of the trimester program is not inherent in
the system, but is rather a function of its orientation at the Univer-
sity. The schedule of classes for the spring trimester, 1966, sheds

‘light on the difficulty. ' .

In several subjects the selection of courses is’ large enough to
encourage attendance. (A good course in the regular. school year.
becomes even better during the spring when class size has dimin-

_ ished.) In chemistry and psychology all the minimum courses re-

quired for graduation in that major are offered.”Participa_tion in the
spring trimester would present no hardship in following the schedule
for a major. ‘ -

IN OTHER AREAS the range is less promising. Out of eight
possible English writing courses, only one—a sophomore cours%is
available. Hence,’ a senior needing one more _course for graduation
cannot attend. . . I -

In biology, only two undergraduate courses are listed. One of

these has three terms of prerequisites and is therefore not open to.

sophomores attending their first spring term..A biology major taking
the spring trimester would cause unnecessary doubling up of courses
in later schedules. A H ' _

There is a similar lack of upper division choices in the physics"
and philosophy departments.

The coming spring trimester is advantageous, therefore, only for
students seeking to complete distribution courses, the list of which
has expanded. Still these students may prefer the six-week session
to merely lighten their normal work load.

THE FORD REPORT specifically states that three times more
graduate than undergraduate students have attended during the
spring trimester. It may be true that graduates are more eager to
complete their degree requirements but in the present spring sched-
ule, graduate courses equal or surpass the number of undergraduate
offerings. Students, it appears, will come only if their courses are
available. '

Fortunately, the source of the unpopularity of the spring atten-
dance has not gone unobserved. Acting Chancellor David Kurtzman
has stated that the deﬁciencies in the current program are known
by the Faculty Senate which is already working to improve next
year’s schedule. The knowledge came too late-to supplement the
already printed spring, 1966, offerings.

It is unfortunate, and surprising, that the flaw in the trimester

' was not uncovered before the present unsatisfactory schedule went

to pressfespecially since summer enrollment has consistently de-
creased since 1960. Perhaps, the problerril is soluble only with the
increased enrollment implied in the newstate relationship.

A LARGER NUMBER of students would be forced to‘ attend
school year-round for mere lack of space in the two-term system.
They would make it feasible to offer more courses—-'which would in
turn attract ‘more summer scholars.

.Professors could be hired on_ a two term rather than the full-
year basis which the Ford report denounced. Their trimesters of teach-
ing could be staggered so that they would take off a different tri-'
mester each year. Courses, especially those in’sequence could be
rotated in the same manner with some essential courses running
every trimester as they do now. Professors would thus be encour-
aged to teach the additional courses in the summer and students,
knowing a particular course or professor would be available, would
be encouraged to come. '

We Canting Art

Discovered  

  By Detective-

Robert Niels, a 23-year-old pre-
dental student at the University,

“kg M was charged last week with steal-
" ’, ing two paintings by Virgil Can-

tini from the 17th ﬂoor of the

— Cathedral of Learning. The paint-

ings, which disappeared some-
time during the night of Feb. 2,
were found in-_,N,iel’s room in the

,r A Delta Sigma Phi fraternity house.

According to police, Niels read-
ily admitted taking the paintings.
His modus vivendi was described
as simple taking the pictures
from the wall and carrying them

‘>3/-“out of the Cathedral in a large

mechanical drawing case.

Cantini is a professor of sculp-
ture at the Univerysity. The two
works that were stol"e‘n, “Destiny"
and “Lamb of God with Wheat,”
Were Valued at $3.50 apiece. Po-
lice said‘ that the paintings would
be returned to Prof. Cuntini.

Niels was charged with lar-
ceny and taken to Central Police
Station; where bond was fixed at
$1,000. His case was resolved,
however, when Prof, Cantini de-

J _ clined to press charges against

Niels for the theft‘ of ‘ the‘ two
paintings.

When contacted about the case,
Prof Cantini remarked, “I don’t
have any comment; I dOn’t intend

to press charges; I just feel sorry e_

fOr/ the poor chap. I hope we can
salvage his school -..recO;d.”

A NEW OUTLOOK

__ What a difference a year makes. At this time last sea-
on the football coaches were wondering if anyone was going
,fof"play football here. There were thoughts about suiting up
‘Horse” Czarnecki and his ground crew.

 X ‘1A recruit was as rare as a Pitt basketball fan. The num-
b‘ei- of letters of intent signed was exactly zero. This year
's‘of this week, their are six prospects who intend to play
orthe University next fall.

I A new system is being used to get players. It is called
jecruiting. Not just calling a boy up or writing him a letter,
"fut sitting in his living room with his parents and showing
an interest in his welfare. ' .

. ;Dave Hart and his assistants are energetic to say the
east. Hart is truly dedicating himself to getting a good
freshmen team here. He is selling this school to the boys
a_nd_ their parents. The graduate schools, the good academic
eputation, competitive schedule, and the new coaching staff
-:'ar_,e all his selling points.

 'He is also doing something else.‘ He is bringing the
boys_and their parents here. This was unheardof in the
past. Nobody even knew it was legal.

 ’ Hart, a member of the NCAA rules .committee, says
" thatit is a perfectly legal manuever..“As long as we only

; ‘and one time the boy, we are perfectly OK.”

6 Last’,weekend and this weekend and the next several
iweekends to come, Dave Hart has prospective fres-hmen
5. with their parents coming to see the University. They are
:hosted by members of the football team and even some il-
 lustrious alumni. ,

, I At the basketball game last weekend past Panther foot-
9 -ballers Paul Martha, Marty Schottenheime-r and Ron Dodson
[were sitting with some prospects watching the game. This
I is only part of a whole itinerary that Hart and his staff plan
ffor every weekend. ,

I Hart's industry and dedication are truly amazing. An
~ "alumni of the university and a close friend of Hart recently
called me after I wrote the column concerning the rebirth
of spirit on the football team.

3 I He had worked with Hart at Kentucky under Charlie
 E Bradshaw. He called to tell me what an excellent coach and
‘person Dave Hart has always been. Also that Hart was

deﬁnitely a good choice for the job.

I After talking to Dave Hart and seeing how everyone
-who meets him has nothing but good words for him, I can
hopefully say that Frank Carver has made a wise choice and
, that Pitt football has a chance again.

Dave Bing Spearheads High-Scoring
Syracuse Cagers Here Tomorrow

‘By JAY ROSENSTEIN

Dave Bing leads Syracuse, the highest scoring basketballxteam in the nation, into
Fitzgerald Field House’ tomorrow night to face the Panthers. The Orange have broken the
100 point mark at least as many times as the -Panther ﬁve has lost, a number that now is 14.

All-American Bing currently is the fif_th leading scorer in the country, averaging
better than 29 points a game. Inaddition to scoring, the Orange senior paces Syracuse in

» rebounds, ﬁeld goal percentage, free throws and assists.

Five WVU players scored in
double ﬁgures, led by Dave Reas-
er’s 19 points. The Mountaineers
hit 57.7 per cent of their shots in
the ﬁrst half.

“They just wore us down,”
said Panther coach Bob Timmons.
“When we meet a team that can
run like West Virginia, we're in
trouble.”

By TOM SACKS
Assistant Sports Editor
' The wrestling team has a bet-
ter chance to interrupt its Clismzll
season with a victory over West
Virginia tonight at l\‘Iorg'aIito\\'n.

The Mountaineer record is 3-6
but their record includes wins
over such schools as Washin;,>ton
Jefferson. Their match tonight is
their only meet against big time
competition listed on the sched-
ule.

Due to last week's lay off, the
matmen held an intra—squad Inatch
up at the Field House on Satur-
clay. The varsity had little trott-
ble -defeating the diary all—stars
with the big match of the day
being‘ Clair Riley against coach
Dave Johnson.

Riley will find the going‘ a lit-
tle bit easier tonight when he

   

drops down to the 152 pound
bracket to wrestle Mountainer
Dick Errett_

Looking ahead to Sa’turda_v’s
Lehigh meet, Johnson has tenta-
tively scheduled Dino Bino to
wrestle at 137 tonight. Boni’s
niatch in that division against
VVest Virginia's Bill Meacci will
prep him for a Saturday show-
down with Bill Stuart, the NCAA
champion.

“Boni has
small ill. 145 thus far this year.”
said Johnson. “His opponets have
been moving around him too eas-
ily. Even though he beat (Don)
New in‘ the Cornell meet it look-

4 *

H ed like he had trouble contain-

ing him."
Dick Shildt, who appears final-

been looking too‘

  

 

ly ready to handle the 123 pound '
class, will displace Tony Liberati
in that position at Morgantown.
The team leader in total points
this season. Ron Schuchert, will
move down to 130 tonight.

Cliff Zolokoff will fill in for
Boni at 145, while Tim Trax will
wrestle at 160 for the first time
this year. Johnson’s other moves
include Randy Kahlor into the
167 slot and placing Al" Traun-
steiner at 177. Terry Hoover will
remain at heavyweight.

Jack Williams will not wres-
tle the Mountaineers because of
a jammed shoulder which has
been giving him trouble ever
since the Army meet.

“It’ll be ready for
though," said Williams.

Lehigh,

' off the boards. .

Tired Cubs Miss
Easy Baskets Ase
Win Streak Ends

The West Viriginia fresh-
men basketball unit halted
the Panther‘Cubs’ eight

game winning streak Monday
night, 98-68, at Morgantown.

“We were tired mentally and
physically,” commented coach
Tim Grgurich, “and for the first
time this year we were beaten
. real bad. They
were getting three or four shots
at the basket. They were really
outstanding.

“It wasn’t as bad as it sounds.
We just couldn’t make any buck-
ets.” Not making any buckets in-
cludes about 25 missed layups.
The Cubs missed five layups right
at the start and never could
quite make a comeback.

“Everytime we’d come back,
we’d blow a ]ayup.”

Grgurich emphasized that -the
season still isn’t over yet. The
freshman have “an 11-3 record
with games remaining against
the Indiana J.V.’s tomorrow
night, and Westminister J.V.’s
and the Duquesne frosh ‘next
week. Who knows, maybe they’ll

ﬁx start another streak.
