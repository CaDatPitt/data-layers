Aid Handbook

SG Asks for Univ.

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

Student Government (SG) rep-
resentatives requested University
funding of a student-aid handbook,
claiming SG funding lacks the
estimated $600 needed for print-
ing. The request came at
Wednesday's Student Affairs Ad-
visory Council (SAAC) meeting;

Student Government Board
(SGB) member Craig Bluestein,
who coordinated the research and
writing of the handbook, presented
a rough draft to Chancellor Wesley
Posvar for inspection, in line with"
the funding request.

“Many students know they want
financial aid, but they don't know
what questions to ask,” Bluestein
said.

The handbook will include
compilations of information not
available to students within the
University, according to Bluestein,
such as information on inner-Uni-
versity jobs, internships and
private sources of ﬁnancing.

According to SGB President
Larry Platt, the uncertainty of SG

'‘ Class requirements

resources precluded any sort of
printing without University assis-
tance. '

The 50-page manuscript was

turned over to the Office of‘ Student .

Affairs for review prior to a
decision on administration funding.

Platt also commented on the fact
the Student Activities emergency
loan fund had been discontinued,
resulting in 50 students being
turned away after requesting use of
the service. '

“It seems the University should
increase the size of this fund,”
Platt said. “The interesting thing
about funds of this type is that if
they're well-administered, they
should be self-perpetuating.”

Bill Markus, assistant to the vice
chancellor of Student Affairs, said
efforts had been made to collect
outstanding loans, although they
often met with resistance from the
students involved.

“In fact, the default rate on the

loans is incredible,” Markus said.-

“We’ve done everything possible
to administer the funds wisely. It's
just being grossly abused.”

 

U.S. Treasury Sec'y Simon

Blasts ‘Stop-Go’ Economics

BY BILL MOORE

U.S. Treasury Secretary Wil-
liam E. Simon diagnosed the
nation’s economic ills and listed his
four-point cure Wednesday‘ in
David Lawrence Hall.

Simon, the .country’s chief
ﬁnancial ofﬁcer for the past'ye_ar
and a half, called for eliminatiomof
what he termed the “stopj-go‘
-behavior” of government in setting-
economic policy, for an effort to
_reduce the inﬂation rate, for
fundamental reforms in tax struc-
ture, and for support by citizens of
Federal economic policies.

“We must maintuain a consistent
effort to reduce the rate of inﬂation
and loosen the grip .of the
inﬂationary psychology now so
'deeply ingrained in our society,”’

A he told the audience of students
‘ and business executives. '

F nd 'n g

'In reply, Platt said an emergency
loan he had drawn over the
summer to pay for books had been
due October 1, and though he
never paid the sum, he had
received no notice of his default
status. ' .

The emergency loan service of
Student Activities hinges on a core
of three grants that form thebulk of
the capital, and is the only service
of its kind at Pitt, aside from the
Interfraternity Council Emergency
Fund administered for fraternity
members. ,

Platt added he couldn't under-
stand how locating and collecting
monies lent out from the fund could
be so difficult.

“I don’t see how it could
happen,” he said. “If they can get
money from students for tuition,
why can’t‘ they get it for student
loans?”

In other business, SAAC’s
Resident Student Association rep-
resentative, Marty Doerﬂer, pres-
ented the results of an informal

Platt Calls forcPub|ic Listing

Student Government Board (SGB)

Wednesday's meeting.
Platt suggested that course

descriptions also should include the
purposes and objectives of the
course, and a list of required books.

“Students have a right to, know

be expected of them if they decide-

 

to take a course,” Platt said. “A
revised course description can aid
students in making more rational
course selections.”

If more information on course
content were available to students
while registering, fewer students
would have to go through add-drop
procedures early in the term, he
added.

“The question here is not
whether the faculty should provide
the kind of information advocated
by our proposal, but when the
information should. be * made

available.

Information on course content is
most beneficial to students while
registering, Platt said. “Otherwise
its use is only important in allowing
students to drop a course, thereby

wasting the time of the student and

the resources of the University.
“Students put in this position are
charged $5 after the second time
they add-drop courses,” Platt
observed. “The University blames

The formation of goals for which

  r SG Allocations Reiterates

‘Deep Throat’ Fund Denial

BY CONNIE GIEL

The Student Government (SG)
Allocations Committee again rec-
ommended that funding for a

 presentation of Deep Throat be

denied, in a meeting last night.
_ The Amateur Radio Association
(ARA) last week, requested a $600

"budget-modiﬁcation to book the
» ﬁlm for
» Allocations recommendation at that

December 6. The
time was to deny funding.

The Student Government Board
(SGB), however, rejected that
recommendation Wednesday and
returned it "to Allocations for
reconsideration.

According to Allocations, one
reason for its recommendation is
that movies are shown regularly on

I campus several nights a week, and

many free ﬁlms are shown through
special departmental‘ programs.

“If Deep Throat is to be shown; _

we suggest that it be done through
the Franklin Pangbom Film Asso-
ciation or the Student Union Board
(SUB)...” Allocations said.
Another reason is that Alloca-
tiohns based, its rationale on past

  lad no Jijaae

recommendations. The ARA’s
request apparently does not fall
within any of the recognized
exceptional categories. p

Special interest ﬁlms, such, as
those shown by the German and
Italian clubs, were assessed no
admission. “These ﬁlms ‘are
educational in nature and are
directly related to the. purpose of
the group as stated in their
respective constitutions,” Alloca-
tions explained.

Other exceptions included
movies shown under the auspices
of Black Week and the Women’s
Cultural Festival. which also
charges no ‘cl(ll'llt5.\S¢l'.*"..

The Commuter Association fol- '

lows Allocations policy by showing
afternoon movies in conjunction
with the SUB. Allocations provides
partial funding to help underwrite
the cost of these ﬁlms for

"commuters.

Allocations also noted the ARA’-s

stated purpose was to raise money
«to purchase equipment. ,

“Pro-
gramming simply for the sake of
generation of income to be used for
the operational needs of a group
has never been attempted in the

past." This is inconsistent with
Allocations policy also, it said. _

A positive recommendation from
Allocations would establish prece-
dent for other organizations to
request similar budget modiﬁca-
tions, Allocations said.

Fearing such a precedent would
change the philosophical basis of

Student Government, Allocations
said other areas should be
examined.

“Instead of using the (activities
fee) money to provide free or cheap
entertainment, we would in effect
be taxing students twice; once in
the activities fee, and then for the
cost of the program,” the rationale
said. .

“The revenue collected would
not be used to ﬁnance further

programs, as is done now, but is:

rather to maintain_the operational
basis of what may be a small

special-interest group,” Alloca-
tions maintained. —

Allocations’ recommendation
will go back to the SGB at

Wednesday’s meeting. ARA
President Sanford Silverberg said
he was unprepared to comment on
the new recommendation.

Police Thief

Shot to Death  \

BY BILL MOORE

A Pittsburgh man who police
believe was the assailant that took
two guns from Pitt Campus Police
on October 22 was shot and killed
Tuesday escaping from two Wheel-
ing W. Va., officers following an
alleged armed robbery.

The body of Marvin L. Thomp-

son, . 30, has been positively
identiﬁed by Campus Police
ofﬁcers,

Police Chief Curt Graham. ’

Thompson allegedly entered
Pitt’s Varsity Hall last month and
robbed Sgt. Edward Pendergast
and Ofﬁcer Thomas Large at
gunpoint, taking. their wallets, two
guns and ammunition.

Wheeling police said both guns
were recovered.

Thompson was shot after he fired
repeatedly from close range at
ofﬁcers responding to an ‘armed
robbery. call, Wheeling police

. officials said.

Thompson was sighted holding
an unidentiﬁed man hostage as he
escaped the scene, but turned on

the officers and ﬁred at their§.f~“

cruiser, police said.

As Thompson ﬂed down an alley,
still firing, the ofﬁcers drew their
weapons and killed the man, police
reported. '

According to authorities, Thomp-
son had been paroled earlier this
year on charges of armed robbery,
bank robbery and escape from
custody.

survey dealing with the movement
of pinball machines.

The survey began October 21

_ and ended October 26. Sixty-two

-people were interviewed in an
attempt to identify whether users
of the pinball machines in the
Towers lobby were primarily
nonstudents.

The survey showed the machines
were used 93.5% by students, 5%
by nonresident students and 1%
by nonstudents.

The single nonresident, non-
student was found at the machines
after they had been moved into the
halls surrounding the Towers
elevators, according to Doerfler.

Since the machines were moved
to the elevator areas, three have
been disabled and one requires
more repairs than it did prior to the
move, countering administration
arguments of cutting down on
vandalism. Doerfler added.

Markus suggested a meeting
between Doerfler and Vice Chan-
cellor for Student Affairs Alfred
Moye in the near future to choose a
third alternative site.

Doerfler expressed concern over
the length of time required to
choose the third alternative site
and reiterated the request to return
the pinball machines to their
original spots in the Towers lobby.

‘A Tenant Rights

Measures that would force
landlords to guarantee rented
properties to be “habitable,” and
barring landlords from evicting
tenants who ﬁle suit against them.
have been approved by a commit-
tee of the state house.

The measures would require the
landlord to maintain property in
suitable living conditions under
speciﬁc maintenance guidelines
concerning structure. electrical
systems. plumbing and heating.

The bill also would require the

landlords to keep the rented
premises free of rodents and
in sects.

The second measure would
restrict a ‘building owner from
evicting or using any retaliatory
action against a tenant who makes
a complaint or exercises any legal
right.

The bills are being sponsored by
House Majority Leader K. Leroy
lrvis and Rep. James A. Romanelli.
both Pittsburgh Democrats.

lrvis said he expects the bills to
receive high priority on the House
agenda and possibly to reach the
ﬂoor before the end of the year.

The ARA would get a smaller

showing, was required to send the

Platt questioned the possibility
that the University could attempt to
prevent showing of the ﬁlm.

“The movie is not banned in-the
City," Platt said. “Can the
University claim it's a different
community from the City?”

The SGB also passed a motion
asking the administration to
determine the average amount of

review the invoice time period, to '
determine the fairness of summer

Students often are not told how

much federal and state aid they will .
be awarded until after invoice due

dates. Platt said. '

Several complaints from-the SGB
are being considered seriously by
the Students’ Accounts Ofﬁce,
according to Platt. .

A toll-free number to allow
out-of-town students to resolve
invoice disputes during breaks has
been
plaints from the SGB, he added.

Other SGB complaints involve

the lack of a procedure for students
to appeal a decision of the Student
Accounts Ofﬁce, and the fact that
students are not informed at the
time of registration when they can
expect an invoice and when it will

' be due.

Platt suggested that the admin-
istration look into the possibility of

The cancellation of this year's Writers’ Conference engendered by
the refusal of funds from the Student Activities Oﬂice, is indicative of
some of the shallow thinking and misdirected interests that can prevail
on campus.

By withholding one-third» of the money needed to schedule the
conference. Student Activities very well could have dealt a death blow
to the annual event. .

The conference was the only Pitt program at which writing students
could meet professional writers and editors. Pitt is a rarity among

‘ colleges in that it has a writing program with no writer-in-residence or

reading programs for bringing in writers for daysat a time to work with
students. , -

Student Activities Director Dan Meloro said the out came because
his office's budget was reduced by 13%. During the next ﬁve years,

the Activities budget should decrease further, so it can be assumed I

safely that the conference has seen its last slate of speakers.

This denial of professional stimulation for student writers comes at
an ill-timed moment in light of the start of the graduate writing
program next fall. , - ,

With new science buildings imder construction almost continuously
and with Pitt’s drive for big-time athletic standing, students and
instructors in the hmnanities can’t help but feel neglected. The loss of

‘ the Writers’ Conference will be felt deeply.’

. When Meloro says, “When you consider that possibly only 250
students beneﬁt from the program, and it’s feasible to tlunk there’s
400 students who want...basketballs for intramurals,” the thinldng
behind such decisions is sadly all too apparent.

Somehow a writers’ conference cannot be’ equated with basketball
intramurals. It’s unbelievable that a major university placing so much
stock in its national prestige can’t come up with the money to make
such a conference possible.

Summer’sLast Gap  

There’s a strange feeling that things’ aren't what they should be at
this time of the year.

Scarcely three weeks from Thanksgiving, traditionally the time when
those botched-up midterms come back and students begin to take their
courses quasi-seriously, an outbreak of simshine warms a campus
unready to submit to the enervation of the coming cold.

Classrooms tend to empty, the lawns are ﬁlled, and for once the
tyrannical continuum of the ﬁve-day. schedule is broken.

Schenley’s leaves are all but gone, having turned as usual from deep
green to murky brown almost overnight. They’re at the peak of their
crunch as we rediscover toes, prematurely stored away for winter,
along with midriffs, thighs and shoulders.

But soon it’l1 rain, maybe today, maybe tomorrow, wising us up to
moreserious realities, causing sandals to be packed away and teapots
to boil late at night. And all that will be‘ left on the lawns are the
squirrels, returning cautiously down the sides of tree trunks to resume
an auturnn’s interrupted gathering. '

  War with a Bit Left Over

O BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

.With more and more exotic
weaponry being contrived to
eliminate the planet in the event of
arguments over oil and territory

' (i.e. the recent reports of continent-

consuming ﬁreball bombs), the

‘ great powers must decide once and

for all to junk big-scale weapons.
As an alternative, there is
biological warfare. '
The use of lab-developed bac-

teria and viruses to wipe out

offending countries is both just and
humane for many obvious reasons.

While nuclear warfare destroys
everything, biological warfare,
when conducted properly, destroys
merely human beings, leaving the

' rest of the ecology more or less

unharmed.

Thus the destruction of the
planet no longer would be a
problem, and the survivors would
have something to which to come

Biological warfare, though spec-

  The Infringing Privilege

BY MARILYN ZRUST

Smokers say they have the right
to smoke. This is true. They seem
to think they have the right to do it
wherever they please. This is
false. What smokers don’t realize
is that those of us who don’t smoke
have the right not to be bothered by
their habit.

In many places, no-smoking
signs have been posted on behalf of
nonsmokers. The Port Authority
Transit took the trouble to have the
message translated into several
foreign languages, perhaps imply-
ing that some people don’t
understand English.

However, infrequently as it may
be, smoking continues despite
these signs. Usually, when
someone smokes on a bus, it is
when the bus is crowded, making it
too hard for the driver to catch the

culprit. The people smoking must g

culture, rubber gloves and incuba- ‘ents itself as a cheap*,—- working

ted chicken eggs.

Thus the cost of a single Trident
nuclear submarine could provide
America and Russia with enough
plague virus to kill the other
thousands upon thousands of

Bio-warfare is within pocketbook
range of almost any country with an
income-tax plan, so everyone
would be truly equal in the political
arena.

In fact, _ the delivery of a
bio-warfare weapon takes nothing
more than a ranking diplomat with
a runny nose. And bio-warfare
keeps working long, long after the
civilizations involved collapse, with
recurrences popping up yearly.

Thus utilizing bio-warfare pres-

alternative to using the nuclear
arsenals with which we now must
deal daily. '

Certainly, ' international powers
must realize nuclear war assumes
that nothing will be left—very, very
bad planning from a management
point of view.

With the widespread use of
bio-warfare, we will be able to sit
down and plan what we'll do after
the war is over. Nuclear war
prohibits that and keeps millions of
federal bureaucrats from wasting
their time.

Given the choice between elim-’

inating the human race and
eliminating the entire planet, no
rational person can help but choose
the former.

know it is wrong, for they disobey
the signs only when it is unlikely
they will be caught. And, since the
bus is full of people, the smoke
lingers longer than usual, making it
quite unbearable for those invol-
ved. Ivcan haigdly believe these
people are_ so hooked that they

can’t wait till the ride is over, which _

is usually not more than an hour.

Thomas J. Kennelly, "chief of the
Bureau of Fire, has his autograph
on no-smoking signs in public
buildings throughout the city.
Many are posted in campus
buildings. Yet classroom smoking
continues. Annoyed students write
notes to teachers, who relay the
desire for clean air to the
remainder of the class. All is well
for two days, but after that the
smoking gradually resumes.

I admit that some classes are
nerve-racking, but they are as a
rule only 50 minutes long. In some
cases, Ithink it is aproblem not of
self control, but rather ignorance
and lack of consideration. Some
smokers just don’t care if anyone
else is offended by the smoke.

Moreover, I doubt if smokers
realize how much a nonsmoker is

Gingerbread Men x

BY TOM WASELESKI

Gingerbread men are fine
fellows. They're sweet and rippled
with frosting. They have soft heads

- and faces that always smile.

They come from the hot oven so
perfect that they’re a credit to the
cookie cutter. They all contain the
same amount of raisins and

walnuts, and if one breaks a frosted _

leg or loses a raisin eye, the cutter
can stamp out a » new, perfect
gingerbread man.

Gingerbread men spend their
lives playing bocci and drinking
mint julep. Sometimes they like to
roll along the grass with the ball.-
They like green lawns. blue skies
and a ‘fair game.

They live in small gingerbread
houses with red licorice gutters,
dark fudge_chimneys and pepper-
mint-stick picket fences. Every
gingerbread house_looks the same,
but the gingerbread men don’t
mind because they’ re pretty.

Gingerbread men never ﬁght‘

because the_\' all look the same and
like the same things.

Sometimes a freak of ginger-
bread nature comes along. A
gingerbread man with one leg
shorter than the other. One who
has a raisin eye missing. One
wliose frosting is chipped. And.
heaven forbid. one who doesn't

doesn’t smoke, smoke makes the

causes coughing, and generally

on clothes or in a room long after ’

the smoker is gone. It is also
unpleasant for a nonsmoker to have
to clean up butts and ashes, or to
receive an accidental burn.

Smoking is a privilege all to often
forced upon nonsmokers. I don’t
mean that they are physically
forced to smoke a cigarette.
Instead, they are forced to inhale
the smoke. If the smoke is in a
room, there is no choice. Many
times it isn’t possible for the
nonsmoker to move.

Not all smokers- are unaware of
the nonsmokers’ plight, because

I've often seen smokers who have-4 $-

refrained, knowing their smoke
would bother some surrounding
people. I

I have no major solution to this
problem, for people will continue to
smoke and those who don’t will
continue to be annoyed by it. But a
little consideration certainly would
help.

When such a freak comes along,

Something Nice
About the Band

In response to the letter in the
October 22 issue of the Pitt News
entitled “More Questions for the
Band," I would like to first of all
ask why people with such strong
opinions very seldom have the guts
to sign their name to their articles?

Each successive week I read
more complaints about the Pitt
band, but rarely is there a name
attached to the end of the article.
Why doesn’t any one ever have
something nice to‘ say about the
band? Certainly they should have
an appreciation for all the effortput
into a show during the week. Often

a» people forget just how easy it.is to

I sit back and find fault, but do they

have any idea of just how much
work goes into ﬁelding a band?
The whole issue concerning
Jacqueling Scott (the majorette
corps member from Duquesne
University) is being misconstrued.
Sure she’s from Duquesne‘, but as
others before me have stated, she
is legitimately a member of the
band by means of cross—registra-
tion. A
I don’t see how you (whoever you
are) have any foundation for your
implications that Jackie became a
majorette strictly because she has

participated in groups under Larry,

Cervi's direction before and is an
assistant to him. If you've seen her
perform, she is one of the better
majorettes, if not the best in the
squad. °
Therefore, how can youattribute
her selection to Cervi's favoritism?
Have you ever seen her perform on
the ﬁeld? As far as being fair is
concerned, I can't see why you
consider it unfair to have to
compete against Jackie; as long as
she can cross-register for band at
Pitt, she's iust like anv other
student eligible for membership.
Now that I’ve commented on the
trivia, let me remark on the
comments that disturbed me most

I HEY wzms , DON'T you HAVE A imp-

of all. I respect anyone's criticism
when it is helpful in some way or

, even suggestive. You say the band

wasn't ‘very impressive, I feel this
is implied when you say the
majorettes weren't impressive,
although they aren't the whole
show, in case you hadn't noticed,
just a nice complement to the band,
and additional entertainment for
the audience. You seem to be
picking at every little point you can
dig up, which I must say. you
obviously had a hard time in doing.

What does the whereabouts of
the majorettes during the ﬁrst half
or the mistaken name in the
program really have to do with
anything? Also, who, might I ask,
are you to decide on just how much
dancing and how much twirling
they should do? Cervi has
many years of experirence as a
choreographer and does his job
very well.

I have received many positive
comments about the band this year
and I feel it is a much improved
band. You may ask yourself why
Pitt’s band doesn’t have coordi-
nated cheers with the crowd as
does for instance, Ohio State’s
band? The answer doesn’t depend
on the band, but rather the
students. However, I doubt that

‘ something as corny as displaying

enthusiasm would go over well
among our student section..I
guarantee the band would be
willing to do this. I’ve often
wondered why Pitt doesn’t ﬁeld a

band of 200 musicians.

Instead of taking an active
interest in the band, all most
students are concerned with is
writing critical letters to the editor
from “anonymous." Well. anonv-
mous, why aren’t you on the field
busting your butt? Whenever our
band has traveled outside of Pitt
stadium, we've recieved hearty
ovations from the crowds during
my four years here at Pitt: and up
until now we never received those
hand claps at Pitt Stadium. If there
exist so many students at Pitt who

'know so much about how a band
should be, why aren't they out
there doing the marching?

It’s not all that easy and not such
a gloriﬁed task here at Pitt. We try
to the best of our ability to put on
entertaining shows, but perhaps
with help from some of our experts
on the bleachers we'd. do better.
The band members welcome you to
join. You same people fought with
band members for the last‘ three
years to get girls on the ﬁeld with
us, so what do you want'now? I
hope someday the band will meet
your high standards. Meanwhile,
we'll keep trying.

By the way, I’ll guaranteeyou
that the band is proud of what it
does on the football ﬁeld each
Saturday afternoon, there probably
isn't a group or organization on
campus even close to us when it
comes to pride.

P RSAPinba||’
Position Given

In regard to your Pitt News
editorial of October 31. concerning

the pinball machines, I would like’

to clarify a few points for you. Your
editorial claims the further away
from the main doors the machines
are less likely they are to be
damaged. This already had been
disproved. On Saturday. October
25. the machines were moved to
the individual lobbies. on that same
Saturday one machine in Tower A
was damaged. it was repaired on
Monday. October 27. and was
dismantled on Wednesday. Octo-
ber 29. The machine in Tower B
had all of the gadgets the ball hits
stripped out and has been removed
for repair. So at this point of the
four pinball machines in the
Towers. two have been so badly
damaged that they had to be
removed for repair. This all
happened within four days of the
move. This indicates that the RSA
was correct in its position on
damage to the machines.

The Pitt News’ implication that
the RSA was, unsuccessful in
preventing the pinball machine
move was substantially correct but’
in all fairness to the RSA it is now
preparing to conduct an appeal of
this decision. The results of this
appeal are not yet in so the Pitt
News was at best premature in its
blast at the RSA.

The only point in the editorial
that in my opinion is valid is the

But Matt was ready for any
unfriendly demons or formless
spirits that might glide our way.
His knapsack bulged with a Bible,
holy water. a silver cross and
various Chinese weapons.

An evil being might snatch my
body up during the night,‘ but not
Matt's. No sir. He'd go down
ﬁghting and chanting wild incanta-
tions to the very end.

We arrived at the cemetery
minutes after the stroke of
midnight on a cool, clear night. As
we parked outside the thick, rusted
gates of the graveyard, it was
mysteriously quiet. Almost too
quiet. -

In silence, we hopped over the
old mortar wall and cautiously
made our way down a thin path into
the eerie expanses of tombstones
and ﬂower-covered memorials.

“Shhh. What was that?" We
froze in our tracks. Our eyes shot
fearful glances into the darkness
we were about to enter. It was
nothing, I assured Matt. .

Through heaps of dead October

leaves we shuffled slowly up a
hillside full of buried corpses until
reached a shrub-co‘vered
clearing at the top.
I There—as if endlessly—stretch-
ed hill after hill of grave-markers,
mausoleums, barren, crooked trees
and a network of black, winding
roads—just like I pictured in my
nightmares. \

Something stirred in the bushes.

, There was a loud flapping noise.

Matt and I stared at each other, our
mouths hanging open. Oh God.
This was it.

A large, pdark-colored‘ bird

‘wiggled out of its hiding place and

winged into the star-ﬁlled night. A
cold wind blew through the trees,
as if laughing at us. ‘

After ﬁnding a well-hidden spot
behind a cluster» of hedges to keep
us out ofsight of any nocturnal
visitors, we spread our sleeping
bags on the ground. 1

Matt rolled himself up securely
and dug deep into the shrubbery. I
lay alongside a row of sunken grave
markers, and the cold night air
enveloped me. The zipper on my
sleepi-ng bag was broken.

I set the alarmvfor 5 a.m.,. and we
silently stared at the stars, trying to

ignore the unidentiﬁable noises
ﬁltering through _the air into our
ears. Soon we began to fall into the
peacefulness of_sleep.

That's when I heard it. Over the

rows of tombstones and cros_ses, .

over the rolling mounds of dirt and
bones. came the distinguishable
blast of a trumpet. Six or seven
different notes were played in
succession. 1‘

“Matt. Did vou hear that?" My
voice shook in terron. “Someone
or something is playing a trumpet
in here." - -

Tense silence followed. “All I
heard was a car horn," Matt said
unconvincingly. “Nothing but a
car horn." _ _

But car horns don't skip up and
down the scale. And car horns
ean’t be heard loud and clear in the
middle ofa cemetery. I had a chew
to settle my nerves, and .Matt
slipped into a deep sleep.

There we lay—Matt curled up

trying to hold back the contents of

‘Nest’ Wins Power Struggle

BY TOBI ROSEN

_The Age of the Golden Cowboy
has returned. McMurphy striding
into the asylum has found his new
home on the range—a place where
he can be his own man.

His natural ﬂair protrudes in the
structuredworld of group therapy
sessions and work periods. He is
unbreakable—-or believes himself
to be. -

One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s
Nest, The Pittsburgh Public
Theatre's second offering of its
inaugural season, involves a
melodramatic struggle for power.
As the play’s director, John Going,
put it, “The play has a hero we can
root for, a villian we can hiss at and
a group of colorful characters that
both amuse us and tug at our heart
strings...”

Surprisingly enough, the sub-
texts of power plays are not that
clearly defined. Both the vindictive
Marine-sergeant Nurse Ratched
and the rebellious McMurphy are
out to win at the expense of the
other patients.

Ratched (otherwise referred to as
“Rat shit”) personiﬁes all that is
shrewd, calculating and systema-
tic. She uses McMurphy as the
butt of her own sexual frustrations.

Whomever she can not control, she - '

tries to destroy, says_playwright
Dale Wasserman.

As
machines entering moral combat,
much of the verbal artillery is
backed by institutions. Society
(i.e., the dumping ground for

human foibles) dictates that the .

“well.” shall reign over the “sick.”
This relationship must remain
stable in order to legitimatize
existence of a psychiatric head
nurse. If she “heals” the
“sickness,” she has no functional

purpose but is at the mercy of the ,

' job market.

“yvf

The play’s organizational struc-
ture is contingent upon a -series of
choices. Those with the power to
“cure” decide not to exercise that
alternative. Ratched perpetuates
the internal workings of a
well-oiled machine. _ ’

But McMurphy will not stand for
organization of any sort. Just give
him room to ride and stretch his
legs. He provides most of the
play’s comic elements. In order for
him to survive in the asylum, he
must assure himself and the others
of its ludicrous nature.

His mockery is an emotional
release from a tragic situation. We
want to laugh along and forget the
serious implications.

But McMurphy laughs too hard
and too long. He sets out on an
earnest crusade and ends up on a
“Messiah” trip. He exploits the
other patients with Ca fatherly
concern, thriving on their respect
and following. Here is a leader
who needs to lead.

 Hudson Bros. to Sell   S

There are two~thin'gs that’ll sell
this album,

First, Rocket Records is Elton
John’s new outﬁt, sort of a
latter-day Apple. Second, the
record's produced by Bernie

- Taupin, Elton’s lyrical better half.

These facts are listed prominently
on the back of the cover, bound to
catch the anxious eyes of millions
of Yellow Brick Roaders.

As for the group itself, which
played Pittsburgh in the usual,
boring, supporting act slot before

Elton John’s show two years ago, it ,

tries to be something that it]
obviously isn’t." The sound comes
off like the early, ill-deﬁned and
unreﬁned Badﬁnger: sloppy, blar-
ing guitars with an imitation Paul-
McCartney backed by a couple of
high school freshmen in a garage.
They overlay some pseudo.-
dramatic strings (on one song, a
soapy violin bursts forth as if
backing the .big kiss on a silent-

ﬁlm) and at times they’re guilty of i

trying to resemble America.

There are a couple of nice spots, H 0

though. One is .“Bernie Was‘ a
Friend of Ours” (who do you think
they mean?), which goes through a
few time changes, surfs like the
Beach Boys through the chorus,

then wraps up with a waltzy repeat ’ .
of the melody, suitable for play in’ 

nineteenth-century Vienna.

“With Somebody Else” drifts to
the raspiness of Raspberries, the
now-defunct group that also tried
to recapture Beatlic vocals. 2
There’s good, strong piano here‘,
but it’s a little too candied to be
real music.

The ﬁrst song, “-Spinning the
Wheel,” would be the group’s-best
bet for a single. The Brothers use
force in this one, with tense
drum-slapping and measured
acoustical strums on the offbeats. _

The rest is just ﬁller.

True charity isn't

A more lasting and dignified way, we say.

Since our foundation in 1859, this has been the
Salesian way. Education is the keynote. What good is a
meal today when one must think of all the tomorrows?
St. John Bosco knew this well. What good are dreams
unless they are translated in reality by deeds?

Around the world, Salesian missioners help their
flock by giving them ways to help themselves. Whether it
is agricultural training or technical training for a trade
they can learn, people are encouraged to find their
own niche, their own way of betterment, their own road

to human dignity and self help.

Salesians work primarily for youth, for it is in the
young that hope is born. There are Salesian missions in
73 countries around the world. If you are interested

Charm of Old Pirates
Gone with Bob Prince

BY STEVE SYBERT

With the ﬁrings of Bob Prince
and Nellie King, the Pirates have

‘.1 . lost their last touch of royalty.

Not since the death of the great

Roberto‘ Clemente, nearly three

years ago, have I felt so unattached
to what used to be my favorite
baseball ‘club-. ‘

I don’t think I could enjoy the
Pirates without Bob Prince. After
all, when the team is not hitting, it
is the National League’s most
lackluster club. The Pirates have
no speed, no defense, no bullpen
and no daring. Sure they have
their mighty bats, but when they
are not put to good use, the Pirates
are a prime example of why people
ﬁnd baseball boring.

So it is not Prince’s fault the
Pirates don"t draw big crowds at
Three Rivers Stadium. Nor is it
King’s. The only accusation that
can be made against the broad-
casting duo is that many people

 _ probably stayed home to listen to

the radio. The Bucs should blame
their low attendance ﬁgures on
themselves and the Stadium’s
$2.50 parking, not on the announ-
cers. .
Prince and King were not only

credible broadcasters, but also a,

two-man radio show. Prince was
the entertainer, the joker, who
enlightened us and added an extra
dimension to the game. Is Joe
Garagiola any different?

Prince brought us “Willie the
Starge,” “The Green Weenie,”
“Babushka,Power” and “a gnat’s
eyelash.” I can still hear him
screaming “Spread some chicken
on the Hill,” “We need a bloop
and a blast,” “Call a doctor” and
“We had ’em all the way.”

In his 28 years on the air, Prince
‘became the voice of the Pirates, the
fans and the City of Pittsburgh.
Now he is given a rude testimonial.

King, on the other hand, was the
straight man. I never thought he
was the greatest announcer-—-many
of his home runs were caught on
the warning track—but he was
appealing to me.
made baseball enjoyable for people
of all ages.

It won’t be the same when I turn
on a game next spring and hear
someone else. We no longer will

hear “John Doe is 88 years young ‘

today,” or “Let’s send a get-well
out to Mary Doe in St. Clair
Hospital”—Prince’s trademarks.
With his departuregthe game will
have been taken away from the
people. I’m sure that’s not what
the Pirates want. "

If the Pirates, Group W and the
Pittsburgh Brewing Company do
notreconsider, I am sure Prince
and King will - ﬁnd situations
elsewhere—.severa1 major league
clubs are seeking announcers—and
wherever they go, many people, by
way of their radio dials,‘ will be sure
to follow.

I’m with you all the way, Bob and
Nellie. And I’ll even offer some
advice. Before you leave us, here
are a few things you can do.

You can take back all the nice
things you’ve saidabout Pittsburgh

people, you can take back the’

enthusiasm you generate by just
being yourselves, and you can take
your Babushka Power because the
Piratesthink they don’t need it.
And lastly, you can thank the
Pirates and KDKA for putting up
with you all these years and “you
can kiss ’em good-bye.”

Fans Coaching Pens

A BY CONNIE GIEL

If Coach Marc Boileau would
listen to the hordes of would-be

hockey coaches clamouring for his-

attention, the Penguins undoubted-
ly would be skating undefeatedly in
ﬁrst place instead of slipping and
sliding way -down in third.

If only. Can’t Boileau hear the
advice and recommendations wil-
lingly thrown to Him from the
reaches of the Civic Arena
balconies?-Doesn't he know the
Pens are only 5-4-1 because he's
selﬁshly icing the strategies all by
himself?

Just last Wednesday, when the

‘Pens battled the New York

Islanders at home, Boileau -ignored
the fan with the perfect game plan.
"Kill Hart." he screamed from the
shadows of D-25. (Gerry Hart is a
New York defenseman.) Other
Islanders ﬁgured prominently in
his strategy. “Put"that little Potvin
pussy where he belongs-.-in the
press box." the fan‘ advocated.
Boileau should have ‘listened.
Dennis Potvin got a goal and four

assists. But perhaps the Penguin
coach was more concerned with
switching hisown lines.

' Left-wing mainstay Lowell.
MacDonald obligingly shuffled
.from the top line with Sy.l Apps
and Jean Pronovost to skate at
right wing with Captain Ron Schock
and Vic Hadﬁeld. Bad move,
Boileau, the Iron City fans
contended.

But by some strange twist of
luck, Boileau’s move -made good.
MacDonald connected for two goals
and an assist. Lucky for him, the
fans grumbled. N

Lumbering Harvey Bennett slid
into MacDonald's usual spot, and a
coach in A-31 swore there'd be
blood instead of punks, in the
Islander end.

' Bennett must not have heard, for
he got a goal and an assist.

Making a mockery of such
high-level hockey politics doesn’t
seem to bother the deliberators.

noon at the Morgantown “‘Pit," or

how about two high-p'a\\Le.sc‘d.

offenses facing each other? The
Panthers are averaging 370.6 total
offensive yards per game-, and

West Virginia is right behind at
. 368.9. Pitt is averaging 29.3 points

per game while . the Mounties
counter with 25.3 tallies per foul:

Defensively, the Panthers are

perhaps stronger. Pitt has shutout:

three opponents thisiy-ear and has
limited he opposition to 257.5 yards-
and 12.2 points per g.ame, while"
WVU~has given up an average of
314.6 yards and 17.5 points per
game.

Or if you don’t like team
statistics. how about individuals?
For example, the Mountaineers’
Arthur “Artie" Owens. “King”
Arthur became the leading rusher
in WVU history last week with
2,339 yards total, a 6.6 average.
Despite injuries, he has rushed for.

746 yards (7.5 yards per carry) and ’

four touchdowns this year. _
His counterpart is the flying
“Hawk," Tony Dorsett. This isihis
third 1,000-yard season and ~he~ is
currently averaging 6.5 yards -per
carry with a total of 10 touchdowns.
Dorsett also has become the
leading round gainer in Pitt’s
history with 3,699 yards (including
the Fiesta Bowl) and 34 TDs.
But two running backs do not -a

good football team make. WVU
tailback Dwayne Woods has
rambled‘ for 414 yards and fullback
Ron Lee is close behind with 405.
Quaiterback Danny Kendra has
completed 48 of 96 passes -for 600
yards and three TDs. The
favored-receiver status goes. to
tight end Randy Swinson, who has
grabbed 14 catches for 207 yards
and one score.

The Panthers counter with Elliott
Walker, who has hit paydirt six
times with 594 yards on 111 carries.

The big questionmark for the
Panthers will be quarterback,

  ‘ Booters Face Mounties

BY JIM LEWIS

The Pitt soccer team will play
West Virginia tomorrow in Mor-
gantown.

Because of‘the vengeful rivalry
between these two powerful foes in
every sport imaginable, this fact
should speak for itself.

Pitt coach Leo Bemis summed up
Saturday’s pre-football game soc-
cer match best: “Like everything
else between Pitt and West
Virginia, they’ll be out to stomp
us.”

They sure will; the intense
rivalry is apparent in all sporting
events between these two schools,
from football to tiddlywinks.

But what’s really frightening
about Saturday’s game is that West
Virginia has the ability to win big.

Despite their .500 record, the
Mountaineers have been more -th an
respectable. In about 10 games
played this season, West Virginia
has beaten such good teams as
Alderson-Broaddus and Davis and
Elkins (a strong team Pitt tied 1-1).
‘ Some of the losses are impres-
sive too. The Mountaineers gave
up close games to powerhouses
Penn State (Pitt’s next opponent),
South Florida and Cleveland State.
They also have tied Ohio State in
Ohio._

What makes West Virginia so
good? The answer is—recruiting.
There is absolutely no high school
soccer in West Virginia, so the
Mountaineers recruit their players
from the East Coast, an area rich in
talent. ’ ‘

Pitt ’ will hardly take the
Mountaineers lightly, ﬁrst because
the Booters need these last two
victories of the season to compile a
winning record.

And second, Pitt will be slightly
shorthanded. High-scoring center
Al Jutca, who was injured against
Grove City two weeks ago, will be
missing another game, and sopho-
more goalie Frank Bucci probably
will miss action because of a
shoulder separation in last week’s
game at Lock Haven. That's really

ill-advised plans by lustily cheering
all seven Penguin goals.

But. obviously. at least to the
disgruntled hockey afﬁcionados,
Boileau ought totake a few of the
would-be Fred Shcros into his
conﬁdence. The Penguin-Islander
score was 7-6 instead of 7-0, and if
only... .

..-...._......s ...... .  ».

bad news for the Booters. '

Bemis agrees that-the losses of
Jutca and Bucci are monumental.
But already he has answers to ease
his problems.

“We’ll probably put Andy
Behrend (starting junior lineback-
er) in goal,” pondered Bemis.
“He’s a good athlete and has a
better chance of stopping shots in
this caliber of play.”

“As far as substituting for J utea,
we can put any of our subs in. It
doesn’t really matter just who we
put in out of our subs,” he added.

The offense, which has scored
only 16 goals in 12 games,

obviously won’t have the punch it

had with Jutca’s leadership and

scoring ability. So the burden

probably will be on the defense.
Pitt has given up only 16 goals in

  

Panthers are much more inexper-
ienced than the veteran Mountain-
eers. Of Pitt’s 18 players, eight
will be freshmen. Four freshmen
will start and the others deﬁnitely
will see some playing time.

“We want to win,” Bemis said,

“but we’re a .500 team with only 1

two games left. Naturally I want to
give experience to the younger
players who will play in the
future.”

The Booters aren’t a cinch to lose
just because they- are slightly
inexperienced. But West Vir-

ginia’s veteran team does have a
small edge. '

“I’ll have young players playing
and they will make some young-
player mistakes,” Bemis said.

But despite the mistakes, the
team’s youthful status augurs _well

However, those statistics came

he’s possibly not going to appear in

defense will be as powerful as it
was earlier this season.

Because an alarming string of

Grgurich‘s next step might be to

He lost his leading scorer, Kirk
Bruce, through graduation, his
leading rebounder and inside
threat, Mel Bennett, to the pros.

Will

his most sought-after recruit Phil
Hubbard. to the University of
Michigan, and his highly touted
freshman center, Kelvin Smith, to
.academic default. And if that isn’t
enough. he might end up loosing
co—captain Tom Richards for the
season because of an injury.

But on Wednesday afternoon's
Press Day at the Field House,
Grgurich was cheerful and excited
about the upcoming season as he
introduced his players to the press.
I The usual clowning around
occurred irrespective of the added
incentive to the players to relax;

"this was the last da_

off for some
time. Grgurich has scheduled
practice sessions every day until

the Panthers’ openef against West

Virginia Wesleyan on November
29

Perhaps the most disheartening
thing for the Panthers» was the
injury Richards sustained last week
in practice. Richards, a six-foot
guard who averaged-12 pointsper
game and was instrumental in the
Panther attack last year, broke, a

small bone in his righ,t,wrist..

The nervicular bone he fractured-
generally takes several weeks ' to

L Ftiday. ~".;*.‘;.;..;;.. 7,":i92/§i—;'riiii§

heal. In such an injury, the hand
is usually in a cast for eight weeks,
but Richards had the cast-removed
Wednesday after just 1-0 days._

' He’ll keep it in a splint utﬂil a few

days before opening day, when he
hopes it will be strong enough.

If not, Grgurich will be faced
with the monumental task of
ﬁnding a replacement for Richards.

Yet despite the adversity that
has confronted the Piinitfiaers,
Grgurich remains optimiﬂtie 'as

(ever.

“I think we're going to have a

heck of a ball team," he stated

BY RALPH SPARKLE

The Pitt cross-country team
confronts its biggest rival, Penn
State. today at 4 p.m. on Flagstaff
Hill, Schenley Park. Pitt is
undefeated at home since the loss
to Penn State two years ago and is
presently 5-0. '

The Nittany Lions, ranked 7th
nationally, are_also undefeated in
dual meets and were placed jtist
ahead of the Harrie_1;s- in ‘the
Central Collegiates last ‘Saturday.

“The key for Pitt’s success in
this meet will be displacement,"
Mick Martin.
“If we can get our seven or eight
men in before their 5th- man, we
will score a big upset."

Penn State's two stars, Paul
Stemmer and George Malley, are
comparable to Pitt’s Martin and
Mel Boyd, and the two duos

probably will cancel each other out ' '

far as team score goes.
The rest of the Pitt squad will
decide who wins the team honors.
Terry Wile, Dave McDonald and
Tom Herrmann, who have been the
unsung heroes of past meets, will
be called upon to aid the team.

The Panthers also will have help
from talented freshmen Bob Lee.
Ron Wirick. Bill Garver and Mark
Studnicki and veterans Mike

215

  

McLaughlin and John Heiser.

-“Pitt needs at least .. a good
showing if not a win to get an
invitation to the National Cham-
pionships," Coach Mike Agosti-
nella said. “The guys have worked
hard all season and their record
shows the success we have had.
The -two biggest steps of our
program are upon us and if
everyone keeps on giving 100%
effort, we will have a tremendous
season."

Penn State has completely
overwhelmed all its competition
this year, but may have more than
it can handle with the Panthers.
The Pitt Harriers have beaten some
mighty foes. ‘

The confrontation promises to be

the best in years. With plenty of ‘

encouragement from the fans, good
weather and lots of DETERMINA-
TION. the Panther Harriers could
execute the biggest upset of the
season. '
