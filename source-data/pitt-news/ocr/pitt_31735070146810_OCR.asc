For The Pitt News

A newmachine unveiled yesterday
in.the Hillman Library will soon let Pitt
students print out books on demand, a
process that makes publication faster,
cheaper and easier than before.

The new Espresso Book Machine, de-
signed by On Demand Books, LLC, can
produce out—of-print university publica-
tions as well as other materials, including
textbooks. The University plans to eventu-
ally move the machine to the Book Center
for public use. A

Printed materials are digitized by the
University Library System and then con-
verted into a paperback book that costs
about the same as a paperback produced

by a standard press. Students can use Pan- T

ther Funds to pay for the books.
Spectators watched yesterday as what

The monitors allow the customer to

Thornburgh said returning to campus was
a nostalgic trip for him and his wife and
that a large part of his life was centere

Rush Miller, director of the University
Library System, said that 30 to 35 universi-
ties worldwide have the machine. People

President Barack Obama thinks you should
know how Pitt spends your tuition money.

That topic, among others, came up in his
half—hour conference call with student jour-
nalists yesterday. The president spoke about
several issues, ranging from defense of his

I record on economic and health care reform to
the upcoming midterm elections, as ‘part of a
campaign to encourage student voter turnout
in November.

.He‘even took a moment to comment on
the good fortunes of Penn State and UCLA

a quick congratulations.

tuition at public universities. He said that he
intends to work with universities in the future
to address rising costs but did not provide
speciﬁcs. 4

Obama said that amenities at public uni-
versities might be one reason for rising costs‘.
He pointed topstadiums, cafeterias and 'ving
costs as areas that typically soak up tuition
dollars. . ‘-

“It’s sure a lot nicer than it was when I was

\ going tocollege. Someone has to pay for that,”
he said. “You’re not going to a university to join
a spa, you’re going there to learn so you can
have aﬁilﬁlling career.”

He said universities need to be more open
about costs, so that students can make in-
formed decisions. ,

university that says out of every dollar you
spend in tuition, here’s where your money

Education reform in Works

Obama 4 1

the ailing economy. A recovered economy, he
said, will allow for states to contribute more
funding for public higher education.

He did not address the federal stimulus
funding, which has supplemented the budgets
of many public universities — including Pitt
— for the past two years.

Part of his plan for higher education in-
cludes putting more focus on the country’s
community colleges and reforming the way
people handle debt. _

Starting in 2014, Obama said, borrowers
will be able to limit student loan payments to
10 percent of their income, and public ser-
vice jobs like teaching and police work will
allow some school debt to be forgiven after
10 years.

Later in the call, he criticized the Repub-
lican Party’s “Pledge to America” plan, which
he said would include cuts to higher education
funding. He said that as many as 8 million
students could lose some federal student loan
money if the plan ever becomes law. ‘

Michael Barley, the spokesman for the state
Republican party, said that Obama was not be-
ing entirely straightforward with that claim.

“It seems like a disingenuous way of cam-
paigning,” Barley said. “I think he’s drawing
his own conclusions.”

The “Pledge to America” plan aims to make
sure students can ﬁnd jobs when they gradu-
ate, Barley said.

The 48—page “Pledge to America” does not

speciﬁcally mention federal fundingfor higher
education. It includes sections on ending fed-
eral stimulus funding — some of which has
gone to higher education — and repealing
the health care reform law, which reformed
the disbursement of student loans.

Barley called Obama’s criticism “scare tac-
tics” and said they were a sign that the presi-
dent was on the defensive in the face of a Wave
of Republican gains in November.

Obama said that the call — and his speech

scheduled for today at'the University of Wis- - C

consin — would try to draw out the college-
aged voters who turned out in large numbers
for the 2008 election. As many as 11 percent
of voters reported that they were ﬁrst-time
voters in 2008, according to CNN. 0 '

' That excitement in 2008 came from people
who “just generally thought that we had to
bringabout some ﬁmdamental changes in
how we operate,” Obama said.

Since people have seen him struggle with
Congress, and as the politics of Washington
has taken the spotlight, “naturally some of

_ the excitement and enthusiasm has drained

I

away,” he said.

Obama will speak today at the University
of Wisconsin as part of the “Moving America
Forward” campaign, hoping to encourage
youth involvement in the upcoming election
and touting plans for reforming higher educa-
tion. Vice Presidentjoe Biden will speak at a
rally at Penn State University. --

EDITORIAL

Despite‘ paper cuts,
textbooks better in print

Let’s be real here: Textbooks are not our
best friends. They cost more than our
designer shades just to hide our faces.

They weigh more than a freshman af-
ter his ﬁrst semester of college. And some
have been known to do more bodily harm
than the food in a questionable restaurant
— paper cuts are nojoke.

But would we prefer Pitt to offer only
digital books instead?

Not at all.

According to a column in The Chron-
icle Review, “To move forward, academe
must transform itself from a fundamen-
tally print culture to one that is funda-
mentally digital.”

Online material has its beneﬁts. “Digi—
tal books are more affordable, acces-
sible and environmentally friendly,” the
Chronicle reports.

But despite the advantages of digital
books, they still have one major draw-
back: Students don’t want them.

Last month, The Pitt Newsfound that
despite the availability of eBooks for
about 140 titles at the Book Center, few
students were willing to purchase them,
even considering thepotential savings.

Each eBook offered at the Book Center
can only be accessed from the one com-
puter to which the purchaser downloads
it. Computers aren’t always the most reli-

able devices, so one crash could be the
equivalent of accidentally setting your
entire bookcase on ﬁre.

There is also concern that reading text

off a screen is not as effective as paper’

reading.

A report on digital reading by Anne
Mangen at the University of Stavanger
in Norway proposes that digital read-
ing “makes us read in a shallower, less
focused way.” In addition, Mangen ﬁnds
that “the process of reading on a screen
involves so much physical manipulation

of the computer that it interferes with ’

our ability to focus on and appreciate
what we are reading.”_

Additionally, some students learn bet-
ter bytaking notes or highlighting in
their books-— something that is made
more complicated by an electronic for-
mat. » ,

And although thedigital books ar_e

cheaper, the cost of less 1expensive‘books<

—— if you can call them that — is getting
rid of an entire group of people’s jobs.
No surprise, The Pitt News cares about
the print publishers. .

So although print textbooks make our
backpacks signiﬁcantly heavier and our

.wallets signiﬁcantly lighter, at the end

of the day, we’d rather cuddle up to one
ofthem than an eBook. I

TUESDAYS WITH MOLLY

Stratego: the midterm-

c

Molly Green
Columnist

 

As midterm elections near, the United States has
uansformed into a kind of war zone. The Demo-
crats and Republicans are assembling their re-
spective “troops” in amanner not dissimilar to
Sauron’s mustering his army of Orcs, trolls and
Nazgul, while Independents who were savagely
abandoned by their former party such as Gov.
Charlie Crist, R-Fla., claw their way through the
political abyss alone in a Gollum-like fashion,
mutteringto themselves, “We wants it, we needs
it, must havethe Senate!” .

' Both parties are behaving in a way that is,
frankly, a bit  But their strategies for ac-
complishing their various acts of villainy are
really quite different. So — like in a good game
of Stratego — let’s break down each party’s
plan of attack. ' ' ' .

The Democrats ,

If the Democrats‘ campaign strategy proves
anything, it’s that they are indeed the “Party
of the People.” This is because the Dems are
espousing a kind of everyman, Maury Povich—
style adcampaign, inwhich they digup as many

' incriminating, juicy stories about their oppo-

nents’ pasts as possible. .
According to The New York Times, Demo-

crats are “using lawsuits, tax ﬁlings, reports '

from the Better Business Bureau and even di-
vorce proceedings to tryto discredit their oppo-
nents and save their Congressional majority.”
Not only does this sound more desperate
than Ashley Parker Angel’s attempted come-
back career, but it perpetuates the age—old tactic
of talking about_absolutely everything but the
issues. - -
The New York Times goes on to list several
examples in’ which Democrats refer to oppo-
nents with various punchy, adjective-ridden
tags of disapproval, including “dishonest used-
carsalesman,” “predatory real-estate specula-
tor” and “millionaire who got rich while his
construction company overcharged taxpayers
thousands, was sued three times for injuries
caused by faulty construction and was cited 12
times for health and safety violations.”

' Add in some female empowerment and just
a bit of Canadian landscape, and you basically

i have a Lifetime movie just waiting to be pro-

duced. Or even better — an evocative, tell-all
novel written by an underpaid, sleep-deprived
and likely malnourished campaign aidewho just
couldn’t take the disgusting levels of hypocrisy
anymore. .
While it’s true that negative ad campaigning

electionbattlefield

has been effective in the past, will it be enough
to save the Democrats, who are currently about
as popular as the rapidly spreading infestation
of stink bugs across the United States?

Let’s look at their opponents .L..

The Republicans, aka The Grand Old Plot-

‘ ters

If the Democrats personify the everyman
kind of evil, the Republicans embody the “haute
couture,” Legion—of-Doom type, in which a
shadowjorganization of crisply attired suits
gathers together in a monochrome, sparsely
decorated room to discuss their grandiose
takeover plans.

Of course, everyone’s favorite evil master-
mind is the man, the legend, the Karl Rove.
And although, followinghis exit from the White
House in 2007, we thought his reign was over, it
turns out that Rove, like Lord Voldemort, was
only biding his time, strengthening his power

' .= and adopting a pet snake named Nagini, so that

he might return now, greater than ever.

According to The New York Times, Rove
has “summoned several of the important play-
ers behind Mr. Bush’s ascendance to his home
once again, this time to draw up plans to push
a Republican resurgence.”

Not only is this as creepy as it sounds, but it
highlights one of the major problems plaguing
the Grand Old Party: the split between the old,
big business-based,-economics-focused Repub-
licans, and the newer Tea Party Republicans.

Rove did not invite a. single Sarah Palin or ’

Glenn Beck to his secret club, but instead invited,
according to The New York Times, “Republican

fund-raiser Fred Malek, the one-time lobbyist V

and Bush White House counselor Ed Gillespie
and former Vice President Dick Cheney’s daugh-
ter Mary Cheney, among others.” ‘

‘ Though it’s possible this collaboration
of “Washington insiders” could alienate the
emotionally sensitive Tea Partiers, we must
remember that, while Rove-looks like your av-
erage bipedal worm, he is undoubtedly one
of the most intelligent political strategists of
our lifetime. f ’

Add to that Roveis penchant for raising mil-
lions of dollars and the fact that the Democrats
are already in trouble, and I’d say that things
are looking good for the Republicans, bad for
the Democrats and even worse for Crist, who I
have to admit, I’m really pulling for — if for no
other reason than to get him out of the Florida
sun and simultaneously startan epic battle with

John Boehner to see who the most orange man
inwashingtonwill be. '

THEATER PREVIEW

Pitt Rep Theatre offers mind-bending lineup

_ A Ohad Cadji | Visual Editor
“Eleemosynary,” one of the upcoming Pitt Rep plays, toys with linear narrative by using three stages to represent three generations.

FEATURE

Larissa Gula
-Staﬁ‘ Writer

For many students’, the word poetry
prompts bad memories of high school
classes and anxiety at the idea of writing
sappy love phrases.

But poetry remains alive and well, sur-
viving as a literary form locally‘ and on
the Internet, according to author Dorothy
Barresi.

Barresi is a professor of English at Cali-
fornia State University, Northridge. She
studied poetry -in Pitt’s graduate program
in 1980 and has published four books since
1991. The newest, “American Fanatics,”
was released in August through the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh Press. Her book has
received praise for delving into the heart

' of American society.

’ Barresi looks back on her time at Pitt’s,
graduate school fondly, citing living away
from home surrounded by writers as a
phenomenal experience. Her style evolved

\\I~

through the graduate school program and
her experiences afterward. I ‘
Today when she grades her students’_
writing, the published poet tells them she
knows that most of them have written po-
etry before, but that she wants to help their
style reach a higher level. V
“There are individual styles,” Barresi
said of poetry. “There is an aesthetic bias
you bring to a poem. I try to leavemy bias
out when I teach. I try to help the student
write the best they can. Beginning poets
need to know about economy, intensity, to
create an image out of ﬁgurative language
and to avoid a cliché. There are all kinds
of things beginning poets need to know to
take poetry to make a hobby an art.”
Barresiadored reading and language
from a young age, collecting her writing
-—‘mostly ﬁction — in a journal. She fell
in love with poetry after taking an under-
graduate course. I
“I was reading contemporary poetry for
the first time,” she said. “It was a world of

language and language play I didn’t even

Pitt grad Dorothy Barresi talks poetry

know existed.”

Today she continues to write and teach
in a culture that is not always receptive
to the art. V

“I think poetry is mysterious,” Barresi
said. _“I think that’s one of the reasons the
public backs‘ away from something they
perceive is challenging. It’s more of an
instant culture that flashes and we get it.
There are still thousands of people who
love to lose themselves in language and
get transported some place they didn’t
expect to go. Poetry is lyrical and strange
and takes us out of ourselves deep into
ideas. So readers turn to get something
they can’t get anywhere else.”

But Barresi stressed that poetry, in all
its forms, remains an active component
in society. ’ ,

I “I think thanks to spoken word perfor-

“All in the Timing: Words, Words,
Words’ and Variations on the Death of
Trotsky” and “Eleemosynary”
Wednesday to Saturday at 8 p.m.
Cathedral of Learning Studio Theatre
Admission $8 forPitt Students

Mathematicians gave us the infinite
monkey theorem, or the proposition
that a random monkey, ‘given enough
time, could almost surely type out the
entirety of “Hamlet.” The Soviet secret
police gave us Leon Trotsky’s death by
ice ax. Brainy wordsmiths gave us terms
like “limicolous.” _

These things might seem like mean-
ingless trivia, but they are the stuff of
drama for two Pitt graduate students.
Dave Peterson, director of David Ives’
“Words, Words,Words” and “Variations
on the Death of Trotsky,” bothfrom Ives’
collection “All in the Timing,” and Grant
Williams, director of Lee Blessing’s “Elee—
mosynary,” have drawn on the resources
of the Pitt Repertory Theatre ‘to create a
triple—feature dramatic experience that
Peterson promises will be “a very full
evening.” t

Perhaps, in the spirit of “Eleemosy—
nary,” Peterson should have used the word
“plenitudinous.” Between Wednesday and
Saturday, he and Williams will stage three
plays in the Cathedral of Learning Studio
Theatrethat aim to amuse, provoke and
move audiences. Fundamental questions
will be posed. Interfamilial relationships

will be dissected. Trotsky will die seven

times. _

Those who only warm to conventional
plots are advised to stay clear. Peterson’s
plays move from exceptionally odd prem-
ises to critiques of cultural authority and
historiography, and Williams’ play is a
minimalist, nonlinear rendering of epi-
sodes in the history of a dysfunctional
family. ’ ‘

“Words, Words, Words” imagines a
scientist locking three monkeys — sug-
gestively named Milton, Swift and Kafka
— into a cage in hopes of demonstrat-
ing the validity of the infinite monkey
theorem. Humorous monkey-to-monkey
banter ensues, as there is much confusion
over their assigned task.

“The monkeys keep asking, ‘What is

Poetry still growing

Barresi, author of “American Fanatics,’

acknowledged in the academic word,”
she said. “I have students who go to slam
events and spoken—word events downtown
where there may be music playing. I think
it’s healthy for poetry that there are also
these other forms. They’re a little looser
on the page and -aren’t so literary, but it’s
all about language.”

The Internet provides outlets for self-
publishing as well, allowing anyone with
a hobby and love for poetry to write and
post their works. _

“It takes poetry out of a precious, spe-
cial place,” Barresi said of the method.
“It shouldn’t be like opera. It should be a
community event. I think all those nonlit—
erary vendors are fantastic. It increases
’an audience and makes poetry more of
people’s everyday lives.”

Poetry still sells fairly well, according to
Maria Sticco‘, a publicist with the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh Press. And there are, of
course, plans to adapt to the market.

“We are trying to keep up,---getting our
books ready for electronic readers,” Stic-
co said. “We’re in the process of making
things electronic. We don’t have a choice.
You keep up with the trends.”

Before getting her book published,
Barresi’s manuscript was reviewed by
members of the University Press. When
reading any submission, Sticco said, edi-
tors gravitate toward stronger styles that
use technique and verse well and that have

’ believes poetry can adapt to the Internet.

varied content. -

“People try hard to be clever and tie in
poetry with something happening in the
news,” Sticco said. “They try too hard.
There are different forms and deﬁnitions
in poetry. There is a pattern to a lot of
poetry — even in free verse. Even if a
lot of our poets don’t go to grad school
at first, authors may go back to validate
themselves.” P

The poetry community is very collab-

orative, Sticco said. She said she admires
that Barresi often supports and works with
other writers.

“They’re all looking for a chance for
people to hear their work,” she said. “We
just want to get the poetry out there.”

With her new book released, Barresi can
reﬂect on the strengths and weaknesses of
her work as she begins a new collection
of poetry. a

“If I were asking myself how my work
has changed, I’d say I am more interested
now in writing about the culture and writ-
ing about where America is right now,” she
said. “I still write about myself that way,
but I am interested in looking outward now
and having an overlay of cultural "exami-
nation or asking questions about where
we’re at in the country right now. In the
beginning I wrote a lot about family. I think
my gaze has turned outward. I like that,
because one can only write about one’s
angst for so long.” I

Hamlet?’ And they mean it on a very prac-
tical level: ‘What is Hamlet‘?’” Peterson
said.

”Words” pokes fun at literary canon- it

ization — or the saturation of culture

with certain privileged texts. The play’s ”

absurdist scenario reframes a question
we have all likely askedourselves: Why is
this book so central to’ Western civiliza-
tion — so central that even probability
theory makes reference to it?
“Variations on the Death of Trotsky”
does for theories of history what “Words,
Words, Words” doesfor literary—canon
making. Those worried that their Soviet
history might not bejl1p,to, the specifica-
tions necessary for enjoying the perfor-
mance should know Trotsky is signif-
icant to the play’ notfor his involvement

in the 1917 October Revolution but for his 1‘

status as a generic historical figure.

_ As Peterson puts it, “Variations” is a
blackly comedic case study in “how we
get historical figures into certain nar-

rative frames that help us make sense, V
of a wealth of historical information.”
Trotsky’s deaths are played for laughs, but;

the cumulative effect of the variations is‘
a destabilization of history itself.

‘While less allegorical and less allu-
sive, Williams’ “Eleernosynary” has by
no meansifewer facets. The title means
“charitable,” and charity in the-sense of
unconditional compassion is a crucial
element in Lee Blessing’s dramatization

_of mother—daughter discord.

Sparsely staged with three. platforms
signifying three generations, the play
collapses a long timeline of family life
into a few charged vignettes.

Dorothea, mother of Artie and grand-
mother of Echo, is an occultist, much to
the embarrassment of her daughter. The
ties between Dorothea and Artie fray
so extensively that Artie ﬂees from her
mother’s presence, only to show up years
later to give her daughter Echo over to

Dorothea’s care when she discovers that’

her maternal instincts are lacking. ‘
Echo grows up to exhibit a special ap-
titude for spelling — a crucial moment
of the play occurs during a spelling bee
— hence the peppering of the text with
esoteric words like “dysphemism” (“an_
offensive expression deliberately substi-
tuted for a neutral one,” according to MSN
Encarta) and “esurient” (hungry). ’
Part of what drives these women apart
is their sense of alienation from one an-
other. Dorothea is a lover of mysticism,
Artie‘ a lover of science and Echo a lover
of language. ‘
But, as Williams said of the play, “You

always say when you’re.younger that you it

don’t want to end up like your mom and
dad, and you end up like them.” This war-

‘ MEN'S‘ SOCCER

scoreless tie for Panthers

 

Ohad Cadji I Visual Editor

Pitt’s Ryan Brode leads the Panthers with ﬁve shots, but he couldn’t get past the Orange this weekend, or his brother, to score a goal as Pitt tied Syracuse.

Greg Trietley
Senior Staﬁ’ Writer

The Pitt men’s soccer team struggled to capi-
talize on scoring chances once again, and the
Panthers traveled back to campus from Syra-
cuse this weekend without a win for the third
straight game.
But this winless trip was a little more per-
‘sonal for one Panther.‘Pitt’s Ryan Brode and
his younger brother, Syracuse’s Mark Brode,
combined for six shots. Yet neither they nor
' anyone else could ﬁnd the back of the net Sat-
urday night, as the Panthers and the Orange
tied, 0-0, at SU Soccer Stadium.
“The ﬁrst thing [Ryan] said to me following

i the game was that [Pitt] should have won 3-0,”

Mark Brode said. “I’m sure the smack talkwill
go on forever about this game.”
Paced by the elder Brode’s season-high ﬁve
shots, Pitt outshot the Orange 22-9, but head.
— coachjoe Luxbacher expressed his dissatisfac-
& .
tion with another goalless outing.
“We missed three or four or ﬁve right in
front that would have sealed it,” Luxbacher
said. “We wanted three points [in the stand-

ings] and we only got one.”

Pitt hasn’t scored since its ﬁve—g'oal out-
burst against St.Joseph’s on Sept. 12. Luxbacher
couldn’t attribute the lack of scoring to any
one factor.

“We waited a split second too long to pull 4

the trigger, or it was blocked, or one thing or
the other,” he said. .
Ryan Brode came the closestto scoringfor

Pitt when his shot in the 60th minute rico- .

cheted off the crossbar. Pitt senior Terry Bo-
land had a breakaway in the dying minutes of
the second overtime, but Syracuse goalkeeper
Jeremy Vuolo challenged and made a sliding
stop. -

Vuolo kept the Orange in the game, tying a
career—high nine saves.

Mark Brode had archance to stun the Pan-
thers 15 seconds into the game and put Syra-
cuse ahead, but Pitt goalkeeper Hami Kara
made the stop on his shot. Nonetheless, the
Brode brothers enjoyed the chance to play
against each other in a college match.

“Growing up we’ve always been competitive
so it was great to compete against each other on
abig stage,” Ryan Brode said. “In the offseason,
we train together every day, but this is the ﬁrst
time we’ve ever played against each other. So

it was a very exciting experience.”

Mark Brode said, “It was an awesome ex- ’

perience playing against [Ryan] because we’ve
never really taken each other on before. Of
course there was a ton of joking around and
smack talk coming into the game. Usually when

I talk to my brother on the phone during the ,
season it’s about how our teams are doing and '

the formations we play, but the week leading up
to the big game, we couldn’t reveal much.”

With the draw, Pitt moved to 4-2-1_ overall
on the season, while Syracuse improved to
1-4-2. The game Saturday kicked off the Big
East schedule for both teams. l ,

“I expected atough game,” Luxbacher said.
“I didn’t expect us to control the game as much
as we did. I thought it would be a tighter game
that way.”

On the defensive side of the ball,‘Pitt han-
dled the Orange attack. Kara had to make just
two saves, both in the game’s ﬁrst 25 minutes,

‘ for his fourth shutout of the season. His goals-

against average dropped to 0.68.

er might not clearly show it, Pitt has a_team

Assistant Sports Editor

At 1-3 on the season, the Pitt football team
could use some good news. But it didn’t
get any yesterday.

Linebacker Dan Mason will miss the
rest of the season because of a knee injury
he suffered in Pitt’s 31-3 loss to Miami.

Head coach Dave Wannstedt said i

in his press conference yesterday that

' Mason will undergo surgery by the end

of the week. Mason has been at UPMC
Presbyterian since Thursday’s game, but
Wannstedt said he hoped Mason would
be out shortly.

“There is some ligament damage,”

Wannstedt said. “How much, and.to what
extent we won’t know until they go in there
and make the ﬁnal diagnosis after surgery.

The injury occurred early enough in
the season for Mason to be eligible for
a redshirt. He played last year as a true
freshman, so Wannstedt said that he will

return to the team next season as a red-

shirt sophomore. I

TONY’S TOP 10

10 teams to root

Pitt fans should be rooting for Boise State to win the National ‘Championship now that

V Tony Jovenitti
Assistant Sports Editor

 

Pitt started the season with national cham-
pionship hopes. Sure, they would have needed
a lot of other teams to fall, and the opening
loss to Utah didn’t help. But there was hope.

Not anymore. '

After Thursday’s debacle against Miami,
all hope is lost for the Panthers’ national-
championship dreams. In fact, Pitt will be
extremely lucky to win the weak Big East and
make a BCS bowl. _

So for this week’s top 10, I give you the best
teams for Pitt fans to root for throughout the
‘rest of the -season. '

4

West Virginia — I know, it’s
diﬂicult to root for the Moun-
O taineers, and Pitt fans obvi-

ously won’t be on their side Nov. 26 when they
visit Heinz Field. But the Big East is looking
pretty pathetic now that every single team has
a loss and it’s only week4. West Virginia is the
only team left that can make the conference
look'good. The Mountaineers just lost a close
one on the road at LSU. But if WVU wins the
Big East, a loss to an SEC power won’t be very
detrimental. And if WVU can win a BCS bowl‘
game, it could be considered a successful year
for the Big East.

USC — The California school is cur-

rently under NCAA sanctions for .

‘ C major violations from the Reggie

or

 

MCT Campus
Pitt is out of the picture.

Bush era and is currently serving a two-year
bowl ban. How hilarious would it be if USC
went undefeated and still couldn’t be eli 'ble
for the national championship?

Villanova — The Big East officially

invited Villanova to j oin its football

0 conference a few weeks ago. With

the weak state of the conference in recent
years, no major Football Bowl Subdivision
schools will be knocking on the door to join.

‘So the only hope the conference hasis to in-

vite the best Football Championship Subdivi-
sion school. Villanova won the FCS national

‘championship last year, and the Wildcats are

currently ranked No. 2 in the subdivision.
All Big East fans should root for Villanova
to repeat. .

Ohio State — Remember how you

i felt last April when West Virginia

0 made the Final Four? Well, wouldn’t

itbe great to see Penn State fans feel the same
way?

Miami —- If Miami can run the

table and ﬁnish 11-1 with its only

0 loss being at No. 2 Ohio State, Pitt’s
crushing home loss to the Hurricanes won’t .

seem so bad; It will certainly still feel bad, and

Pitt fans will never quite get that taste out of

their mouths, but let’s be honest, most of the

college-football world isn’t paying attention to

Pitt. If people see that Pitt gave up a blowout

game to an _11—1 Miamiyteam, the loss will be

Oregon — With USC out of the

O 10 teams ﬁnally have a chance to

make a name for themselves. Oregon, ranked

No. 4, is currently in the best position to do

that. And besides, how can you not root for a
team called the Ducks?

Michigan —- The reason to root for

the Wolverines is twofold. First, Den-

O ard Robinson — injury withstand-

extremely entertaining to watch. Second, it

would really tick off West Virginia fans if Rich

Rodriguez won a BCS bowl game, or even a

O TCU fans were looking forward to

the chance to take down a national power in

a BCS bowl game. But instead, the BCS pit- '

ted TCU against Boise State in the Kids Table

Bowl — oops, I mean the Sugar Bowl. TCU
» is currently ranked No. 5 and has legitimate

Utah — If you’re cheering for Mi-

O you’re cheering for TCU because
they’re the underdog, then you’ll love Utah.
Utah is still undefeated. And out of the non-
BCS conference schools, the Utes have the
toughest schedule. If they can stay undefeated,
they should have a shot at the national cham-
pionship game, or.at least a BCS bowl. There
is, admittedly, one problem: Utah and TCU
have to play each other. ‘

Boise State — Boise State is the ul-
timate underdog. Unless you’re an-

cheer for the Broncos. They play an exciting
' style of football, and they always take risks.
America fell in love withthe Broncos when
they stunned Oklahoma in the 2007 Fiesta

played. At No. 3, Boise state just needs to hope
for either Alabama or Ohio State to lose, and
they will have the inside- track to the national
