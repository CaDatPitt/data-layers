Pitt Conclave
Is Praised By

Cherrington

 

A Speaker Sees Convention

As Expression of

Student Thought

 

“The political convention which
the Pitt students are planning to
lstage is another manifestation of

lthe extremely intelligent, realistic,

and honest views which I have dis-

covered at the University. I have
visited many American colleges
and universities, but have found
none that equal this school in these
respects.” "

This is the statement which Dr.
Benjamin Cherrington, Director of
the Foundation for the Advance-
ment of Social Science, University
of Denver, made in commenting
upon the political convention to be
held on the campus in April.

“A com’ention such as this,” he
continued, “will give politics a
more realistic flavor than can ever
be obtained from textbooks.

“I believe that this is a fine ex-
ample of steps which can be taken
toward -the prevention of such ca-
tastrophes as the World War,
which was envisioned in 1912 by
Walter Lippman," the visitor con-
cluded. "* -

The convention was also lauded
by Dr. Roswell (H. Johnson, head of
the department of oil and gas pro-
duction, who said, “The proposed
political -«convention is some evi-
dence, that the American student
body is not so uninterested in the
great vital problems that their crit-
ics, seéinglsome evidence to the
contrary, sometimes assert.

“I think discussions of this type,
especially in committee sessions,
will develop and clarify the views
of many of those engaged. One ad-
vantage.of such conditions is avoid-
ance of more artificialities than is
usual in debating.

“It is, in fact, a real situation, de-
ciding on the details or a resolution

Petitions bearing the signatures
of approximately 500 students have
been received by the Y. M. C. A.,

and Y. W. C. A., offices. Delegates

wishing to submit petitions may‘do_
so at any time before the conven-
tion, but should do so immediately
if they wish to insure their being
placed upon the committees of
their choice, according to John
Bracken, Col. 33, chairman.

For Cap-Gown

Marlatt To Select Cast
For Show Next Week

 

 

Bill Marlatt came into town this
week, the piano in Heinz House
was tuned up, and another Cap and
Gown show was under -way.

More than 150 embryonic musical
show stars turned out for tryouts
to “Silver Dominoes,”, the club's
25th annual production, looked to
open April 18. A

Plunging immediately into the
task of selecting choruses and cast,
Marlatt, director for the third con-‘
secutive year, put the men through
dance routines Tuesday and Wed-
nesday evenings, and went through
the book of the show with aspirants
for the cast last night. Definite se-
lection of cast and chorus will be
made early next week with actual
rehearsals expected to get under
way not later than Wednesday.

Fresh from New York with a host
of new ideas in dance routines and
stage effects, Marlatt lost little
time in starting his work. Having
had an advance look at the book as
prepared by Louis Fushan and

Norman--Reis, '-Marlatt came «to town».

enthusiastic over the show and pre-
dicted that the forthcoming pro-
duction would be the brightest in
the twenty-five years of the organi-

Schools From Voting ‘A‘En Masse”

Phif_e~r-Plan
Voted Down;
Urge Change

Councillors Take Action
On Health Needs, Tap
Day Assemblies

 

By WILLIAM THEIS

Student Council came out of its
shell Wednesday night and, amid
the most intense discussion Heinz
House has heard in two semesters,
voted down a proposed plan for
election reform. - .

Submitted by Richard Phifer,
Bus. Ad., ’32, the proposed changes
in the election code included plans
for a more uniﬁed general election
procedure and a strict supervision
of the electoral count. ~ -

Phifer’s plan called for nomina-
tions to Council to be /made by
senior members of Council in co-
operation with the olfice of -the
Dean of Men. It also would have
permitted any student not nomin-
ated to have his name placed upon
the ballot upon the ﬁling of a pc-
tition signed by a representative
number of regularly enrolled stu-
dents. Under the present nominy
tion system, no student, not named
by the nominations committee of
Council, can run for election to the
campus governing body.

The changes supbmitted to Coun-
cil Wednesday also
deﬁnite method of conducting elec-
tions. Under the plan, students in
the College, the Schools of Business
Administration and Education
would vote in Heinz House. Stu-
dents in the Schools of Dentistry.
Mines and Engineering would cast

ing, thus eliminating the 

the present system.

It was this phase of
scheme that met with the greatest
opposition in the Council chamber.
Those‘ opposing the plan based
their arguments on the contention
that it was impossible for Dental
school students to vote except in
lecture classes and that the concen-
tration of polling places at two’
points on the campus would auto»-

what it would amount to if this
plan were put into effect, for Dental
students would be unable to take
advantage of their voting rights.”

Franklin Yellig, Col. '32, argued
in favor of the plan for fair elec-
tions saying, “Voting in the past
has been made too easy for some
schools and too involved for others.
It has proved to be dangerous. No
group should have greater rights
than others.”

It was suggested by Walter
Rome, graduate manager of student
activities, that the point of geo-
graphical location of campus polls
objected to by the Dental and En-
gineering students be worked out
in a conference with representa-
tives from those schools and sub-
nlitted at the next meeting of Coun-
sil.

He said: “It must be admitted
that Dental School has a premium
. an advantage over other
schools in general elections. But
certainly some plan might be
worked out whereby a more fair
system could be put into use.”

Other business enacted in the
rather spirited council session in-
cluded adoption of a motion to pe-
tition the administration for the
immediate improvement of student
health service which was declared
to be inadequate, and the endorse-
ent of recommendations for
changes in the method of conduct-
ing spring tapping exercises.

Following the report of Bleed
Rose, Dent. '32, chairman otathe
committee investigating health con-
ditions at -the University, Council
unanimously authorized the ap-
pointment of a committee to sub-
mit two plans to the administra-
tion. One plan would provide for
immediate action with regard to
establishing adequate health serv-
ice, and the other would offer sug-
gestions for the development of a
permanent health service policy.
The changes in the method of
conducting tapping ceremonies by
honorary and scholastic fraterni-
ties, as endorsed by Council, pro-
vide for two separate exercises.
Druids, Cwens, Mortar Board, and
Omicron Delta Kappa, the honorary
activity fraternities, would be given
permission to hold an additional
tapping ceremony beside the exer-
cises which would be given over
to the scholastic and professional
organizations,

  The A Campus
Scout Says:

The fellow who coined the expfession, “To the victors belong the
spoils,” evidently wasn't up on his sports.
A Friday night, the Pitt swimming team was in New York for a
meet with New York U. The Panthers were after their eleventh
straight victory. Things did not go as well for the Panthers as they
had hoped and with but two events, the 440 and 100-yard free style
events remaining on the program, Pitt needed two ﬁrsts and a third
to win the meet by one point.

0 Hanna was Pitt's only hope in the former race, and his
chief opponent was Irving Frank, collegiate champion at that
distance last year. Hanna, however, won the race while New
York men finished in second and third place behind him to
make the score 26-24 in favor of the home team.

Hanna was entered in the 100-yard event, too. Coach« Corr
counted upon him for third place and Adlersberg for first to
give his team the 30 points. necessary for victory. Hanna was
pretty; tired from his efforts in the previous race, and no one
expected him to finish better than third with only an outside
possibility that he would gain the point needed in that event.

 

The race started and Klunk, N. Y, EU. captain, and the two Pitt
‘boys were swimming neck and neck for more than half the race.
When they came ‘to the ﬁnal turn, Hanna turned around, pushed out,
raised his head from the water an instant to gain his breath, and in
that short time noticed that the N. Y. U. man's feet were just ahead
of him and that Adlersberg was just making the turn. '

Somehow or other, Hanna put on an extra spurt. He seemed weary
to the spectators, but that extra something was in him to catch Klunk.
They were but five yards from the ﬁnish. Stroke matched ‘stroke and
then Hanna's hand slapped the end of the pool just with his oppo-
nent's hand stretching for the same goal. ‘

 

Coach Corr and some of the other members of the Pitt
swimming team dragged Hanna from the pool. “Anything you
want in New York is yours," said the jubilant Pitt coach to the
team-’s hero.

That night, Pat put the wearied Hanna to bed, while the
rest of the swimmers had ,the pleasure of hearing Coon-
Saunders in person.

.

 

Although Pitt's basket ball team this year is having an in-and-out
season, Pitt is not without its usual championship team during the
winter months from the showing made to date by both the riﬂe and
swimming teams. ,

Unfortunately for the two sports, meets are but sparsely attended
with the result that not much publicity is given to the efforts of the
participants. But from the records made to date by both teams, the
members are entitled to all the credit that they receive.

The riflers started off poorly last year due to their lack of
a shooting range. Conditions were next to impossible for a
successful team until the new rifle range was installed in the
stadium. Better conditions aided the Panthers materially and
they spurted to ﬁnish eighth in the national standing.

‘ Came this year with renewed hopes. Having the advantage
of a good range from the’ beginning of the season, the marks-
men have compiled an enviable record to date. Their lone
loss in a dual match came at the hands of Cornell. All other
opponents have fallen, and the victory list includes Carnegie
Tech, which annually possesses one of the finest teams in the
country. .-

 ' Pitt's real test will come in the national championships at

..Annapolis. From the form shown to date, however, Coach
Lieutenant Wilson ‘believes that his team will be a favorite to
cop first honors. - , .

The swimmers can likewisebe‘ proud of their mark to date. They
went along winning all their meets last year but because most of them
were with amateur clubs, nobody gave the team much thought. But
"three meets were scheduled with college teams last year.

The Panthers entered the Eastern Intercollegiate Swimming As-
sociation last year so that the team could arrange matches more easily.
But the team has not only arranged matches but has won them and has
better than an even chance of ﬁnishing its second season in a row
with an undefeated record.

Our only regret is that the championship potentialities displayed
by the members of these two teams are not given the credit due them.

Lions Determined to Gain
Revenge for Defeats
of Past Years

 

The fag end of the collegiate
basketball season finds Dr. Carl-
son’s Golden Panthers striving to
finish their season with fifty per
cent of their games on the right
side of the ledger. To date the
Pitt floormen have won eleven
games and dropped fifteen, six of
which were lost on the gruelling
western trip.

Tomorrow night finds the Pitt-
ites invading the floor of the Penn
State quintet. Undoubtedly the
Carlsonites will find the State lads
determined to add a floor victory
to their boxing triumph of a few
weeks ago. The ‘Lions feel that
their golden opportunity to humili-
ate the Panthers on the hardwoods
‘has at last arrived, after a regular
yearlybeating from the Pitt floor
teams of the past. We shall see
what we shall see!

Tuesday night the ice-cream
eaters of Dr. Carlson go to Mor-
gantown to engage the West Vir-
ginia five in a return encounter.
The Mountaineers were unfortu-
nate enough to pick on the much
tossed around Panther here at
the stadium about a month ago'on
one of their few‘ good nights this
year. The result was that they re-
turned to Morgantown a badly
beaten team. Tuesday, Eddie Cub-
bon, high-scoring West Virginia
center and his mates may return
that heating to Carlson's mites.

Bob Timmons, reserve football
end, has been added to the Pan-
ther squad following his showing
Freshmen in the
Frosh-Phys-Ed‘ game last week,
but will hardly break into action
this Year. Timmy Lawry continues
to lead the Pantherscorers, and a
along with’ the clever Don Smith
has been outstanding in the Pitt
games. Ochsenhirt has shown im-
provement in each game, and next
year should be a valuable asset to
Carlson's 1933 aggregation.

Unbeaten Frosh Five
0 Face W. Va. Tuesday

Paul Zehfuss’ freshman quintet,
with ‘eleven consecutive games un-
der its belt, are all set to ring
down the curtain by capturing its
next four games.

West Virginia frosh, defeated by
the Panther yearlings, 26-24, in a
hotly contested battle a short
while ago, will seek to stop Zehf’s
boys Tuesday night. The Mountain-
eer frosh stopped the thirty-nine‘
game winning streak of the Du-
quesne first year men last week,
and have been undefeated since
dropping their first encounter to
the Pitt lads.

Before this tilt the freshmen
face another undefeated quintet
when they meet the formidable
Penn V State freshmen Monday
night. ‘

The absence ‘of Cribbs, flashy
yearling center from Jeannette,
has failed‘ to stop the onslaught of
Coach Zehfuss’ team which con-
quered Beaver high and Dormont
high by decisive scores during the
past week. 1

Pitt Spikers

I-Iard Practice Begins For
Outdoor Meets

 

Saturday afternoon by the West
Virginia spikers, the Pitt track
team went into intensive training
for the outdoor track season which
is scheduled to begin April 23 with
the Ohio State relays.

The Pitt team may possibly take
part in other invitation meets be-
fore the Ohio State dual meet but
ngthing definite has been arrang-
e . . ,

The Pitt team should leave the

track house in which it has been
training since the opening of
training season, about March 18.
The facilities of the track house
are very poor and 'it is impossible
to reach any degree of form by
practicing there. Frequently when
the weather is frigid, the stoves in
the track house prove to be in-
adequate and the spikers. leap
around with chattering teeth and
blue skins.
- The members of the team will
remove themselves to the Pitt
Stadium where they. have plenty
of room and don’t breathe in dust
laden air, and where they have a
satisfactory straightaway on which
to sprint. ,

The Pitt boys were able to take
but three firsts in the contested
events in the meet with West Vir-
ginia last Saturday. The Panthers
won the four-fifths mile sprint re-
lay by forfeit.

The members of the Pitt team
who copped firsts were Watkins
and Valenti, the former winning
the half mile run in the good time
of 2:01 3-5, and the latter snagging
the shot put. The Pitt relay team
made up of Monheim, Milligan,
Keller and Harris won. the two-
fifths mile sprint relay- race.

The outstanding man for the
Mountaineers was Captain “Runt”
Callaway who won the 70 yard high
and 10W hurdle races and took a
second in the high jump. Cy. Ruble
set a new West Virginia record in
the pole vault, Bill.Ford broke the
high jump record with a 6 feet, ‘3
inches leap, and Gordon Fraser
tied his own record of 7 3-10 see-
onds in the 70 yard dash.

_Roy, Pitt, took a second in the
mile run, Harris and Milligan
snatched second and third in the
70 yard dash, Luch did second best
in the shot put, Sebastian took
second in the broad jump and Val.
e_nt1 copped second in the thirty.
five pound weight throw.

ly defeated a basketball team from
the West Virginia University.

Herbert Lewis, Col. ’33, handily
downed his opponent in a one-sided

Panthers Win Two On
Eastern Trip

 

 

Tomorrow at the Keystone Ath-
letic Club pool, the Pitt natators
will meet the strong Franklin and
Marshall swimming team. Frank-
lin and Marshall. which is a mem-
ber of the Eastern Intercollegiate
Association, may prove 8. hard
milestone for the local team to
surmount in completing an unde-
feated season. The out-of-towners
are coming here with a strong re-
lay team, which is a weak cog in
the Panther aggregation. If the
Pitt team wins this event their
victory ought to be pretty well
assured. .

The Panther swimming team
came from behind to upset New
York University, 30-29 in the Lon-
don Terrace pool last Friday.
Trailing 24-26 as it entered the
final event the Panther team an-
nexed first and third places to
triumph. {The dual meet, which
closed the N. Y. U. season was
stubbornly fought throughout.

Although Jack Klunk, brilliant
Violet swimmer, broke his own
school record for the 50 yard free
style nace by covering the dis-
tance in 0:25 2-5 seconds, Jack
Hanna, the local shining light, was
the outstanding performer. Be-
sides swimming as anchor man on
the relay team, Hanna annexed
the 440 and 100 yard dashes. His
first place in the latter race vir-
tually clinched the meet for his
team. ‘

Realizing that Pitt's only hope
for victory rested in stopping
Klunk in the 100 yard free style,
Coach Pat Corr decided to start
Hanna, despite the fact that Han-
na had won the 440 shortly be-
fore, and lacked sufficient rest.
Until the last 15 yards it seemed
as though Klunk would return the
victor, but Hanna suddenly sprint-
ed to overcome Klunk’s three Yard
advantage by inches.

Carik, as usual, won his special-
ty, the fancy diving, and also took
a second in the 150 yard back
stroke, with Joe winning the
event. Adlersberg took third in the
fast 100 yard sprint.

The following evening the Pan-
ther ran true to form by taking
the measure of Rider College, 35-
24. It was the lrst defeat that
Rider has received In two years.
Hanna kept up his consistent and
brilliant work in winning two free
style events, with Joe Schmieler
and Adlersberg sharing the rest of
the honors. .

night, the Cadets turned up with a 5 to 2 victory over-Penn}

headed Pitt’s way with the an- the evening_ '
nouncement that Jack Schricker,
Pitt’s 155-pound hope, may be un-
able to ﬁght due to an injury suf-
fered the early part of this week.

These two losses, coupled with,

at 155 pounds, Art Sekay, anoth .
football man, will likely be Coac
Orsini’s choice. Sekay lacks th
experience and finesse of schric
er, but can be counted ,upo to
put up a good fight. This will marl:
Sekay’s first collegiate _bout.‘.

In the two 165 pound bohts,
Coach Orsini will put Pitt hopes
in the hands of Duke Si,egel_-and
George Shotwell. Both , boys,‘ have
terrific punches and intend to
finish their bouts as soon as ‘pos-
sible. Army will, more than likely,
rely on Cadets Kendall and,_Ai‘os-

ents lack and are favored to win
their bouts. However, Siege] ﬁnd
Shotwell will have a lot. to say be»
fore the decisios is given to any
one.

Pitt boxing stock to a new low.

Army has one of the- best
teams in the history of that insti-
tution, and to date has won six
of its seven matches. The cadets
have won over Penn State, M. I.
T., Temple, Western Maryland,
New Hampshire, and V. M. 1.,
dropping one match to West Vir-
ginia.

Pitt Less Impressive

Pitt's record is not as impress-
ive, showing losses to‘ Temple,
Penn State and Syracuse, but a
victory over West Virginia. Pitt
seems the underdog in a big way
for tomorrow’s bouts, but the Pan-
thers have a. habit of coming
through when least favored.

With Conti definitely out of the
picture, the 125 pound berth seems.
headed for Joe Namlick, who will
be fighting his second collegiate
bout. Namlick will have plenty of
opposition from Cadet Cleveland,
who has as yet to lose a bout.

There will be two bouts each in
the 135 and 165 pound classes to
make up for the lack of fighters
in the 115 and 175 pound divisions.
Willis Schimpf, who won a de-
cision over Fischoff of Temple in
his only start this season, and Har-
ry Martin, veteran from last year’s
team, will be the Panther’s repre-
sentatives in this class while their
opponents will be cadets Coit and
Engler.

Schimpf Acting “Captain

Neither school has shown much
strength in this class during the
year,’ and the results of the two
bouts are considered tossups.
Schimpf will be acting captain for
the Panthers.

Mario Rubbo will again take
over 145 pound fight. Either Cadet
Hagan or Cadet Tiffany will op-
pose Rubbo. Cadet Hagan seems
to be the logical choice by reason
of his record of one draw and
