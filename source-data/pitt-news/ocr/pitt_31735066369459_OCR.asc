SGB Okoys Allocation For Two G

I

By JEFF COUCH

it News Staff Wi‘llCl'

The Student Government Board,
unable to settle the question of

; funding formals and a Black Action

Society lecture, rejected a ‘second
budget submission from the
Allocations Committee to fund the
seven student governance groups
Wednesday. The board then began
reconstructing the budgets, but
voted to accept only two, Inter-
Honorary Council’s and the Resi-
dent Student Association’s.

If the SGB fails to reconstruct the
governance groups budget “pack-
age” within two weeks, the

recommendation of- the committees

will be automatically approved.
The reconstruction must be
approved by at least ﬁve board
members.

The committee had recom-
mended funding the Greek Week
formal_ and the Engineering Stu-
dent Cabinet Shamrock Ball, along
with partial funding of the Nursing
Student Association formal.

“It is the closest thing to a
guaranteed success for a student
government funded program, said

SGB rejected a second submission of budgets for its seven governance groups at the board's Wednesday meeting. Ex-
cept for IHC and RSA, the board must devise budgets for the remaining g'overnance groups.

Mike Seitz, Allocations Committee
coordinator.

SGB member Tom Kunkel said

after the meeting that formals are a
good way for students to escape

from “The trials and tribulations”
of academic life.

‘‘I feel that groups like the
Greeks and the Engineers have one
main week during the year and the
big event of the week is the
formal,” he said.

Lack of Funding Puts End To
Computer Search Service

By RICK KUCIK

A university computer search
service for students and faculty is
faced with the possibility of closing

1 due to lack of financial support.

The Social Sciences Information
Utilization Laboratory, which will
close June 30 if more funds are
not obtained, is a free computer-
ized bibliographic retrieval service.

In service since 1972, the lab has
operated the past two years on a
budget of $75,000.

This year, Pa1Il Peters, a

research associate who supervises
the service, said a budget increase
of approximately $93,000 is neces-
sary.
’ The service, which is funded by
the university, has been notified
that over 50 percent of its budget
will be cut.

The lab, located in the Graduate
School of Public and Administra-
tion Library, performs literature
searches for bibliographic refer-

ences drawn from the lab’s five
social science files.

These ﬁles include journals in
education, psychological abstracts,
and United States and international
political science documents and
abstracts. The ﬁle contains over
600,000 documents and is growing
at a rate of over 50,000 new
documents per year.

The searches, which take a week
to ten days, are free to Pitt
students, faculty and staff.

Professor Discusses Nuclear Leak

By The Associated Press
HARRISBURG-A Nobel Prize-win-
ing biologist and radiology profes-
sor said Thursday that drifting
radiation from the Three Mile

Island nuclear plant has created a-

cancer threat that may not be
evident for years.

i “What we’re dealing with is
fallout,” said Dr. Ernest Stem-
glass, a radiology professor at the
University of Pittsburgh. “Plain
old bomb-type fallout.”

Sternglass called for the shut-
down of Three Mile Island and said
the community should “stand up
and scream.”

“It is not a disaster where people
are going to fall down like ﬂies. It
is a creeping thing,” he said.
“Every dose of radiation is an
overdose,” added Dr. George
Wald, a 1967 Nobel Prize winner
and professor emeritus at Harvard

“Inside ‘today ’s Pitt News

University. “There is no thres-
hold. A little radiation does a little
harm, and more of it does more
harm.”

He added, “The terrifying
trouble with any cancer-producing
situation is that cancer may appear
after 30 years.”

The two spoke inside a Quaker
meetinghouse at a news conference
sponsored by Mobilization for
Survival, a national coalition of
anti-nuclear organizations.

The conference was called in
response to an accident Wednes-
day at Three Mile Island, located
about 16 miles southeast of the
capital. Company officials insist
therepis no danger of over-exposure
to radiation.

But Sternglass said he measured
radiation levels 15 times greater
than normal background levels in
his Pittsburgh office. He took the

readings over Harrisburg airport
Thursday with a portable radiation
meter. _ '

He and Wald took issue with
utility company statements com-
paring leaked radiation levels to
exposure during a dental or chest
x-ray.

“It’s perfectly insane,” said
Wald. “A dental x-ray does not
stay on for hours or days. This is a
cumulative thing we’re talking
about.”

Sternglass said a person couldlbe
exposed to more radiation in an
hour in Harrisburg than the level of
exposure the Environmental Pro-
tection Agency considers safe for
an entire year.

Both said the exposure has
signiﬁcantly increased the risk of
cancer, particularly for pregnant
women since fetuses are 100 times
more susceptible to radiation than
adults.

campaign not to fund formals

that substantial when compared to
their spending of the rest of the
evening,” he said after the
meeting.

The Greek Week formal should
be the only formal to be funded,
according to SGB member Kim
Watterson.

“It is a big event and it is a good
event,” she said, adding, “The
Greek Week formal is the only one
that we can rationally fund.”

Allocations Committee had re-
commended no funding for the
BAS lecture during Black History
Month. Seitz said the committee
had already recommended funding
four major BAS programs totaling
$6,500 and that the board could not
afford to spend an additional
$1,577 dollars for the lecture.

Park said the lecture should be
funded and that the board should
retain their past “dedication” to
funding black programming on
campus.

“Black History Month itself is
an event that is important to the
black population at Pitt,” he said.

Residence Life Discusses Success of Room Selection Process

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

The new lottery system that
determines which upperclassmen
will receive fall housing in the
residence hall is not perfect,
according to Fred Fonseca, director
of the Office‘ of Residence Life, but
it is superior to the status quo
format used for years at Pitt and
recently abandoned.

Speaking at a town meeting for
residence students in Tower A
conference room yesterday--
although most of the participants
were representatives from the
School of Nursing and UCEP

‘L program and other groups that

have found fault with the lottery--
Fonseca said the purpose of the
discussion was for a feedback
session on the new system.

“We (ORL) don’t claim to have
the answers to everything,”
Fonseca said.

“The crunch for on campus
housing has been growing,” he
added. “Five years ago, it was not
tough to get on campus housing.
We’ve been hit with a lot of
concern from parents, friends and
legislators criticizing the univer-
sity-90 percent of the phone calls I
receive are concerned with the
housing situation.”

Fonseca and JoAnn Gibbs,

assistant director of the office,
stressed that housing in the
residence halls is not automatically
promised to incoming freshmen,
although 1,500 spaces in the
dormitories are held for them.
Approximately 4,111 places are
divided among the returning
upperclassmen, with over 700
places giyen to students with
guaranteed housing--Chancellor’s
and Provost’s scholars, disabled
students and athletes on full
scholarships, relocates from re-
gional campuses and residents of
Amos Hall, which houses several
sororities. ,

Challenged by a student shut out

of the dorms by the lottery and who
is currently on the waiting list as to
why the change to a lottery system
was made without a vote by the
students concerned, Fonseca said
that the outcome of such a vote
would have been predictable.

“We knew if we put it up to the
students in a democratic vote, it
would probably go back to first
come, ﬁrst serve,” Fonseca said.
“We took a hard line position
against going back to the status
quo. It would have been a ﬁasco. ”

Last year, the status quo was
reached in nine working hours.
While all 1,579 students on the
waiting list were placed in

university housing by September,
Fonseca said the system was» not
working. He cited a discussion
with Penn State’s director of
residence life. Penn State recently
switched to the status quo
system--and students waited 36
hours in line to get their deposit in
early.

“We were trying to strike a
balance,” said Fonseca. “It was
a very unpopular decision. Many
people consider the procedure of
drawing a number somewhat
impersonal, but it did give
everyone an equal chance. We had
it open for nine days, it was very
equitable.’ ’

Towers Closed DuringSummer for Repairs, Renovations

By JEFF DUROSKO
Pitt News Staff Writer
Due to Towers security renova-
tions, students attending spring
session will be housed at Lothrop
Hall according to Donovan Hughes,
director of housing.

“We’ve traditionally put people
in Tower C and either A or B
primarily to give students the
option between singles and
doubles,” said Hughes. “But,
because of the lobby renovations,
not only will the traffic pattern be
bad, but it will be very noisy._’’

Hughes said that he has received
thus

no complaints far from

students and doesn’t think that.he
will get any.

“Lothrop is a popular residence
hall during fall and winter terms,”
he said. “The only disadvantage is
that it is not air conditioned.”

According to Hughes, several
proposals were discussed among
administrators, the Resident Stu-
dent Association, Office of Resi-
dence Life and Towers dorm
councils concerning what security
measures would be taken.

One of the most imnm-+«m+
renovations, said Hughes. is the
construction of a new stairwell in
the main towers lobby adjoining
the one now in existence.

“The purpose of the stairwell is
to enable us to implement 24-hour
security in the Towers,” he said.
“Students won’t have to go
through the actual dorm to get to
the cafeteria.”

Other problems are the mail-
room, laundry room and access to
the main lobby for Tower C
residents.

“The security doors will be
changed to a more internal position
making the mailroom accessible
from the main lobby,” said
Hughes. “A walkway will be built
between Tower C and the main
lobby with the extension of a wall. ’ ’

Hughes added the laundry room
will be moved to the area in the
main lobby where the wall will be
extended.

“We wanted to take all of the
student necessities out of garage
area, such as the laundry facilities
and linen exchange,” he said.
“The linen exchange will probably
be in the old Tower B snack bar,
which will give students a free shot
to the linen exchange area, laundry
room, mailroom and cafeteria.”

students will be housed in the

The renovations have the full
approval of RSA, administrators
and the presidents of both Tower
A and B hall councils, Hughes said.

“There has also been some
discussion with members of the
Tower B hall council,” he said.
“Their main concern was 24-hour
security. All I could tell them was
that there may be variations in
procedures of how the renovations
are done, but that the concept itself
was not up to discussion. We
simply responded to ideas of the
RSA.’’ ’

State Senate Awaits House Action on Education Budget

By MARGI STUMPF
Pitt News Staff Writer

Members of the State Senate
Appropriations Committee have
taken on a watchful-waiting at-
titude toward Gov. Richard L.
Thornburgh’s proposed 1979-80
budget, according to Jeff Miller,
chairman of the Student Govern-
ment Board's Public/Govern-
al Relations Committee.

Student lobbyists met with
members of the Senate committee
Tuesday to push for more state
appropriations for Pitt.

“The response by Senate was
simply that they’ll watch what
happens in (the state) House
because it’s not their (the Senate’s)
ball to carry. Most likely the
governor’s budget will go through
the Senate untouched,” Miller
said. ~

The state house is currently split
over thebudgetissue, he continued,
for several reasons but mostly as a
result of the November elections,
when 47 new representatives were
brought into ofﬁce, and a piece of
sunset legislation.

Number Of

By JEFF DUROSKO

Pitt News Staff Writer

The. number of Co-educational
Community Development units in
Pitt's dormitories has been reduced
for next year, according to Joanne
Gibbs, director of the Ofﬁce of
Residence Life (ORL).

The Lothrop unit has been totally
cut and Tower B’s has been
reduced to one floor, the 18th.

‘,‘It’s community development
with a new twist,” said Gibbs.
“The 17th floor will be all-female,
18 will be co-ed and 19 all-male.”

The sunset legislation is a bill
passed in 1977 that called for a 10.5
percent corporate and a 2.3 percent
personal income tax that would
phase-out in 1980.

But Thornburgh’s budget relies
on income levels generated by such
a tax, or a similar one—HB 608,
introduced by Rep. George F. Pott
Jr., R, Allegheny.

That bill calls for maintaining the
coporatel tax at 10.5 percent and
decreasing the personal income tax
to 2.1.

Whichever tax—if any-——is ﬁnally
implemented, Thornburgh’s bud-
gets poses a constituent vote-threat
to the new no-tax representatives,
and consequently they oppose
passage of the budget.

Additionally, the House is split
along party-lines, with new Repub-
lican members, with their no-tax
increase stance up against pro-tax
incumbent Republicans.

“Under normal circumstances
the budget would pass under
party lines but because new
members were elected this way (on
the basis of no-tax

According to Gibbs, after room
bidding, there was such a small
number of people signed up for the
co-ed floors that ORL had to ask the
people on 19 to either move to 18 or
elsewhere in the dorms.

“We really don’t like to just
place freshmen on a co-ed ﬂoor
without them requesting to live
there,” she said, “and that’s what
we would have ended up doing.”

Mary McCaffrey, a resident of
the 19th floor who was planning to
return to that co-ed floor next year
said, “If they (ORL) would look at

increase

platforms) there is a split. (The
Republican House majority) can’t
get enough votes together,” Miller
said.

Despite the rift in the House and
the consequent middle-of-the-road
attidue of the Senate Appropra-
tions Committe, Miller said lobby-
ists pushed Senators for increased
funds for Pitt.

He said members cited the idea
of ‘state-related universities offer-
ing l.ow cost, quality higher
education.

Over the past ﬁve years tuition
has increased a total of 46 percent
at Pitt, Miller said, saying state
Senators were told increased
tuition “defeats the whole idea of
state-related "universities as they
are no longer affordable.”

Additionally, Senators were re-
minded that the inﬂation rate over
the past ﬁve years has been 16.7
percent, a trend that out-steps the
proposed $61.7 million proposed
appropriation for Pitt in ﬁscal year
1979-80.

who wanted to return to 19 next
year, they would see that all eight
of the girls who bid for rooms on 19
were freshmen who were iust put
here without requesting it.”

McCaffrey said in past years,
most students who returned to the
unit were freshmen who were
“stuck” on a co-ed ﬂoor. She
added that the former title of the
co-ed floors, “Community De-
velopment,” is misleading.

“Freshmen don’t know what it
is,” she said. “The title doesn’t
tell you anything.”

Gibbs said the response to these
units was “minimal,” but added
that freshmen will ﬁll the remain-

freshmen will request the rooms to
ﬁll the rest of the spaces,” said
Gibbs. She added that if they
don’t, freshmen will be placed
there and the unit will remain Quiet
Living regardless of the response.

the budgets at the meeting, board
members were split on the issue of
funding formals and the lecture,
failing to obtain the ﬁve votes of
approval necessary.

Some of the board» members
‘believed a compromise is the only

way the stalemate ‘can be resolved.
“If there are differences, we
must iron them out,” said ‘Stan
Galanski, SGB president.
Watterson said the board must
compromise to insure input in the
decision.
“If we don’t compromise, the

second submission will just go
through and we will have no say in
the matter,” she said.

Some students believe funding
the formals will sacriﬁce funding
the BAS lecture and visa-vers‘a,
according to the board members.
Board members emphasized that

each group’s budget is considered
separately, not simultaneously.
The board had voted earlier in
the meeting to accept the Inter-
Fraternity Council and Panhellenic
Association budgets with IHC’s
and RSA’s. But the board voted
later to reconsider the two budgets

dgets

because of a “procedural error.”
The board had mistakenly con-
sidered the Greek Week budget

is actually a subcommittee of IFC ‘

and Panhel and its money must
be approved along with those
budgets.

For students now spending precious hours running
between the Registrar’s Office and myriad other of-
fices trying to finalize their fall term schedule, there
is a bit of good news. A new information and

referral center is to be established to help students in
their running battle with bureaucracy.

We wish Firth good luck with his plans, which
could help turn the university into a more hospitable
place to live and learn. We all have experienced the
frustration of getting a run-around from four dif-
ferent offices or the anomie that can develon after
long hours of lonely study in the library. With the in-
stitution of the information center, we look
hopefully for an end to the chilling unfriendliness
here.

We must also acknowledge the role of the faculty ‘
and especially the Senate Council Student Affairs
Committee for the concern it showed that resulted in
the foundation“ of the center. Such empathy for
students is indeed promising.

Perhaps the basic humanity Firth plans to build in
student orientation and the information center will
be contagious and spread to other offices on campus.
It may be too much to expect, but someday,
registrar’s clerks might even greet students with a
smile and a warm hello.

Hope for Personal
Bureaucracy

Bob Firth, the newly hired coordinator of new
. student programs and information and referral ser-
vices, has said the new program should be operating
by the fall term,_ answering any question a student
might have about Pitt. If the office is unable to an-
swer any query, it can then refer a student to the
proper department that can solve the" student’s
problem.

A

Even more promising are Firth’s plans to make his
program as personal as possible-—a_ quality most Pitt
students find missing in the stares of registrar office
clerks and account office cashiers. His attitude ‘
toward the use of taped messages shows a healthy
aversion for the coldness that is often typical within
Pitt bureaucracy.

“Questions should be answered by a human voice.
People very often ask the wrong questions,” said
Firth. “It’s frustrating to listen to the wrong tape for
five minutes and then wait for some person to get on

the line and answer the right questions.”

As the new director of the student orientation,
Firth looks to fight the fragmentation and imper-
sonality that pervades the student community too.

He plans to associate freshmen who live in the same

dormitories with common mentors and advisors.

The students of divergent backgrounds can then

develop a small community that will contribute to the

growth of the whole group.

Comparision of Greek, BAS Programming Asinine

My dismal opinion of The Pitt
News received further conﬁrmation
in Monday’s editorial. The crux of
this article was that Inter-Frater-
nity Council and Greek Week did
not deserve increased funding at
the expense of the Black Action
Society. \

First, you wrote glowingly of
BAS’ programming budget. You
mentioned three of the items on
BAS’ agenda (whose cost added up

to a mere $6,000) and proceeded to -

gush on about how much they
would benefit ‘ ‘not only BAS’ small
constituency. but also the whole
university community. ’ ’

I-Iow asininel Since when have
BAS’ programs held the slightest
appeal to anyone other than black
students? How many white
students have you seen attending
BAS sponsored events. if you’ve
ever been to them at all? BAS
programming is aimed exclusively

at blacks, and at least BAS has
never pretended otherwise, even if
you do.

You also denigrated Pitt’s
Greeks, saying that they were “a
small minority” whose programs

. were “of questionable value to the

majority of Pitt students.” For
your information, there are more
Greeks than blacks on this campus.
More important though is the fact
that the Greeks, more so than any
other group, benefit the entire
community. The parties, Greek
Week events and formals attract
considerable non-Greek interest
and participation. The $30,000
Greeks raised for charity, the
blood drive (Greeks donate more
blood than any other group in
Pittsburgh), all the Oakland clean-
up beneﬁt everybody, blacks as
well as whites. -

Where you really lost all
credibility with me was when you

condemned funding $300 for a
polka party for the engineers while
solemnly approving of a $1,600
BAS request for a black history
speaker (who are they getting, Alex
Haley?).

Let’s take a quick look at the
facts. The Allocations Committee's
recommended budget gave BAS
$6,546, or more than any other

governance group, in addition to
the $27,000 BAS already receives
from the university for “social
services.”

Undoubtedly, the Black Action
Society is an important part of the
university and is entitled to its fair
share of programming. But I for
one am tired of seeing a large

portion of my activities fee go for
programming from which I will
never beneﬁt. Clearly a more
equitable distribution is called for
and the Allocations Committee’s
budget is ‘a move in the right
direction.

Blue Devil Fan Wonders Why
Panthers Not Team in NI T Meet

A recent letter to the Duke
Chronicle from Mark Pollock sang
the praises of us Blue Devil fans.
Mr. Pollock was pleasantly shocked
at how much we appreciated the
performance of the Pitt team and in
particular Sam Clancy.

mention in his letter was that the
Pitt team was one of the best teams
and definitely the most - exciting
team to come to Duke in years. One

watching the game couldn’t help,

but appreciate Pitt’s performance.

In fact, even ardent Duke fans
fell in love with the Pitt team. I will
also go so far as to say that there is
not another college basketball
player in the country who is more
fun to watch than Sam Clancy.

Clancy is not only an amazing
talent, but he is an electrifying
performer, a thrill to watch and a

' basketball treat to anyone watching

him.

People here are still talking
about Pitt and Sam Clancy. We’re
very sorry you didn’t get a bid to

the National Invitational Tourna-
ment. You could have won it.

This brings up an interesting
question.

Why are the Pitt team and Sam
Clancy such a secret? Nobody
knows about them. You’ve got a
great basketball team up there and
one of the best players in the nation
and the only people in the country
that know it are the ones that have
had the enormous pleasure of
seeing Pitt play.

In closing, I just want to say to
Mark Pollock. Thanks for the letter,
and to the Pitt team, thanks for the
great game.

Being in a ﬁnancial bind is no

knows that. Almost every branch
of this school, whether it be
academic, social or athletic is
affected by the short supply of
funds. And being in a similar

money hoping for the best. Even

common sense to ﬁgure out that
they asked for as much as possible,
a la state aid, and hoped for the
best. It can't hurt to ask for as
much as possible.

Secondly, the Greeks may be a
minority in numbers, but not in
success. What other single force
(except Pitt Football) in the
undergraduate population of the
university could raise over $30,000
for the American Cancer Society,

ﬁll Carnegie Music Hall with an
internal social event, or supply

you use more judgment before
wasting half of a page, 1/32 of your

Commuter Committee To Revive

By PETER KARLOVICH
Pitt News Staff Writer
The Student Government

Board’s Commuter Affairs Com-
mittee met yesterday to outline
upcoming plans for starting a
commuter newsletter, constructing
more bus shelters on ﬁfth Avenue
providing more parking and ex-
tended meters and selling t-shirts.

The newsletter is the ressur-
rection of “The Magic Bus,” the
former voice of the Commuter
Committee, published several
years ago.

“The Committee needs better
communication with the com-
muter, ’ ’ co-chairperson Bernadette
Herward said. “With this
newsletter, we hope to reach a
majority of the student body.

“The information in the news-
letter will inform the commuter of
activities available to him on
campus and provide information
about the Port Authority,” said
Herward.

Plans also call for an issue to be
printed for freshman orientation.

uncertain at this time. A petition
currently bearing the names of 500
students is being circulated,
requesting more bus shelters on
Forbes and Fifth Avenues. The
committee is also investigating the
possibility of obtaining more
parking for students in Oakland.
“The parking situation is ter-
rible,” Herward said. “Most of
the meters are only one or two
hours and are a-great inconvience.
It is also impossible to ﬁnd a place
to park. We're hoping we can get
enough people interested to put

pressure on the university or city to
get something done.”

The committee is composed of
four sub-committees:program-
ming, services and facilities,
parking and driving. and mass
transit.

“Right now the sub-committees
are understaffed, but our member-
ship is growing. We were hoping
that with the people we have now,
we can persuade more people to
join,” said co-chairperson Anita
Meehan.

Commuter students represent

ewsleﬂer

over sixty percent of the total
undergraduate population.

The committee is also plannihg
to sell t-shirts. According to
Meehan, John Synder, a member
of the committee, has been working
on several designs to use on the
t-shirts.

In other business, the committee
voted to support the Pothole
Victims of Pennsylvania and a
group planning to protest in front
of the.Gulf Oil building downtown
against high gas prices.

Information Library
Closes: Lack Of Funds

(Continued from page I)

A practical example of how the
lab operates would begin with a
client deciding to do a research
paper on mainstreaming.

“Mainstreaming” is a term
commonly used when placing

p retarded children in public schools.

However, this heading would not
provide a client searching through
a card catalog with all the
information relevant to his topic.
This could result in many long
hours of manual research in the
library.

At the lab, Gail Ricketts and
Cindi Carbine, information retrie-
val specialists, discuss the topic
with the client and then run a
computer search of the ﬁles by
feeding in strategic details of a
topic. Afterwards, °the client
receives a computerized print-out
of references and abstracts of
relevant material in his specific
area.

The service, which has sought a
student market since its inception,
conducts about 8,000 searches a
year and services over 6,000
clients.

The information specialists who
retrieve the information usually
average about 19 clients in their
four hour work shift each day.
Work becomes heavier as the
semesters progress.

Peters will meet with an advisory
board on April 4 which, at that
time, he will present a cost analysis
of the service as compared to other
means of retrieving such informa-
tion.

Although computer time is
costly, Peters said that based on
the number of searches completed
and the number of clients serviced,
the unit’s cost remains as low as
other means of information retriev-

al.

The service can also help a
faculty member obtain material for
classroom curriculum. In addition
the service is used to help search
material for an experimental
week-end college program.

The increases asked for in the
budget, according to Peters, are for
minimal operating expenses, with
most expansion coming strictly
from the manual work and ideas of
his staff.

WPGH Founds

Fraternity
Chapter

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Members of Pitt’s radio, station,
WPGH, have founded a chapter of
the national broadcasting honorary
fraternity, Iota Beta Sigma, to help
generate closer ties between
students and professionals in the
ﬁeld of broadcasting.

. “We are currently in the process
of recruiting new members, writing
by-laws and formulating how we’re
going to function on campus,” said
newly elected chapter president
Jeff Couch, former general manag-
er of WPGH.

Other officers include John
Linko, vice president; Rich
Loperﬁto, secretary} Ric Franzi,
treasurer; and Al Goldman, histor-
ian. '

Couch said that members--male
and female--must be involved in
college radio in any aspect.

“I think the fraternity is also
going to serve as a source of
recruitment for the radio station,”
Couch said. “We’re going to trv_to
be very active rather than just 6105"
and meeting once or twice a year
for the purpose of having a
good resume.”

Couch said that the fraternity
will serve as a compliment of
WPGH and be involved with fund
raising projects, banquets, awards,
arranging guest speakers from
professional radio stations and
setting up workshops.

“We would also like to be a
central location where profession-
als can recruit new employees,”
he said.

The idea for founding a chapter
of Iota Beta Sigma came from
Couch and Pitt media advisor Larry
Lunsford.

“I don’t think — anybody ever
thought of it before,” Couch said.

He said the chapter will be
received this summer.

Panther Sluggers Take 2
In CM-U Dodzldieader

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt’s baseball team (2-0) opened
its season on a winning note by
sweeping a doubleheader from
Carnegie-Mellon, 8-3 and 7-0,
yesterday on the loser’s ﬁeld.

The Panthers completely domin-
ated, outhitting and outpitching the
hapless Tartans in both games.

First inning home runs by Marc
Massa and freshman Stu Mayer
paced the Panthers, who never
trailed in either contest. The home
runs were Massa’s and Mayer’s
ﬁrst hits as collegians.

In the ﬁrst game, Pitt scored in
every inning but the third and
ﬁfth, with its big inning the second,
when it scored three runs.

Massa was the hitting star in the
ﬁrst game with four hits, including
his first inning home run.

In the second game, Dave Crist
and Marc Bianco teamed up to
pitch a one-hitter as Pitt used a
three-run third inning to win
convincingly.

in both games,” Pitt coach Bobby
Lewis said. “Our hitting, on the
other hand, was good at the top and
the bottom of the lineup, but weak
in-between.

“I was happy to get them (the
games) in,” added Lewis, alluding
to the overcast weather that
threatened to postpone both
games. “Everybody got to play.
Marc Massa got off to a good start
and a lot of people came through
with hits.”

BASEBALL NOTES: Tony Di-
Saia, who started the first game,
and Crist were the winning
pitchers, while Don Koller and
Bianco got credit for the saves . . .
Pitt has yet to lose to Camegie-
Mellon, whose baseball program is
only two years old.

Panthers Vye for National Trtle In
 AIAW Gylmastics at Penn State

By JEFF DUROSKO

Pitt News Staff Writer
For the first time in the history of
Pitt gymnastics, the Pantherettes
will compete for a national title.
Pitt begins competition today in the
Association of Intercollegiate Ath-
letics for Women (AIAW) cham-

pionships at Penn State.
The Pantherettes qualiﬁed 15th

-out of 16 teams with .a season

average of 133.016. But, Pitt has
already defeated 10th-seeded Ne-
braska and came within one point
of upsetting ﬁfth-seeded Louisiana
State earlier this year.

“Our goal is to make the top
10,” said coach Donna DeMarino
Sanft. “We won’t know how
realistic a goal that is until we get
there.”

Going all-around for the Pan-
therettes are All-East team mem-
bers Roxanne Evans and Myra
Bachuchin) along“ with Bonnie
Tressler and Holly Martino. Bachu-
chin and Tressler competed in

nationals last year, but are looking
forward to competing with their
team instead of as individuals,
Sanft said. ~

“Each girl has had her own
physical problem, but we’re as
ready as we can be,” said Sanft.
“I thought the girls worked hard
for regionals, but they’re working
even harder now. They’re really
going all out.”

Competing in addition to the four

all-around performers will be

Karen Zandi, Diane Debich, Dawn
Reimer, Jill Morris and Alison
Hoburg. Hoburg will compete in
only the balance beam and uneven
bars and is questionable in the ﬂoor
exercise due to an ankle injury.

Sanft said the Pantherettes ‘are
really looking forward to competing
as a team in the nationals.

“It’s a lot more fun competing as
a team,” she said. “It means a
whole lot more to represent Pitt as
a team rather than as individuals.”

Following the Eastern regionals

held two weeks ago at Maryland,
Sanft said that many of the
coaches, competitors and fans were
saying, “Where did Pitt come

from?” She said they would like to i

make the same impression on the
teams at nationals.
“The girls are ﬁred up,” she

said. “They want to put Pitt on the

map in gymnastics and be taken
seriously. There’s a lot of pride
involved here.”

GYM NOTES: Pitt was ranked

19th in the latest national poll but

will deﬁnitely move up in the
standings after AIAWs...The point
spread between Pitt and 10th-
seeded LSU is only 1.6...The top
ﬁve seeds and their qualifying
point averages are: California
State-Fullerton, 143.2; Clarion,
142.008; Penn State, 141.64; Utah
138.09; and LSU, 137.55...Every-
one competing for the Pantherettes
will have a chance to receive
individual honors...

players as Don Gullet, Luis Tiant, Rich
Gossage and Reggie Jackson. Can
anyone stop them from winning another
American League East pennant?

NEW YORK

The Yanks, defending world champ-
ions, are again a strong team, despite the
loss of ace reliever Sparky Lyle. But the
addition of ex-Boston pitching star Tiant
(13-8 last season) and ex-Los Angeles
standout Tommy Jonn (1/-10) make the
Yankees unbeatable.

Strong hitting, pitching and bench will
earn New York another East pennant.
The only possible weak spot is in the
bullpen, where Gossage (10-11) and Dick
Tidrow (7-11) are going to be counted on
extensively.

BALTIMORE '

The Orioles feature strong pitching
year after gear, but hitting has become a
problem. altimore doesn t have much of
it, and the low-scoring Orioles can’t
afford that problem if they want the
pennant.

Catcher Elrod Hendricks (.333), in-
fielder Eddie Murray . (.296) and
outﬁelder Ken Singleton (.293) hit well
last season, but they will have to repeat
such hitting performances for Baltimore
to stand a chance.

Mike Flanagan (19-15), Dennis Mar-
tinez (16-11), Scott McGregor (15-13) and
veteran Jim Palmer (21-12) are one of the

T best starting pitching rotations in

baseball.
MILWAUKEE

The Brewer bombers, who led the
American League in homers with 173 last
season, are back en force. Larry Hisle
(.290, 34 homers), Gorman Thomas (32
homers) and Sixto Lezcano (.292, 18
homers) make up Milwaukee’s powerfu‘

outfield, and good-hitting shortstop
Robin Yount (.293), third-baseman Sal
Bando (.285), first baseman Cecil
Cooper (.312) and second-baseman Don
Money (.293) p are the inﬁeld. The
Brewers boast ominous hitting.

Pitching-wise, Milwaukee has a decent
starting rotation, acquiring Detroit ace
Jim Slaton (17-11) over the winter. He
will join Mike Caldwell (22-9) and Larry
Sorenson (18-12).

But lack of bench and a good bullpen
will cause the Brewers problems, enough
problems to keep them in third place.

BOSTON

The Red Sox ﬁnally signed superstar
Jim Rice, and a sigh of relief could be
heard from the New England area.

Boston already boasts ﬁrst-baseman
Carl Yastremski (.277), catcher Carlton
Fisk (.284), outﬁelder Fred Lynn (.298)
and a bevy of other legitimate superstars
in the ﬁeld, but pitching will hurt the
Bosox’s chances of making the pennant
race as close as it was last season.

Gone are Tiant and Bill Lee (10-10, 3.46
ERA) from the starting rotation.
Although Mike Torrez (16-13) and Dennis
Eckersley (20-8) return from last year, no
one on the remaining staff looks like a
legitimaterstarter. Jim Wright (8-4) is
back and Bob Stanley (15-2) could repeat
his good year, but otherwise, the pickings
are few.

DETROIT

Without Mark Fydrich and Rusty
Staub, what threat can the Tigers be?
This year, Detroit will ﬁnd out.

Fydrich isn’t pitching this season
because an injury to his pitching arm
hasn’t healed, and Staub plans to retire.
The pennant hopes of the young Tigers
will have to be shelved for yet another
year.

Detroit does boast catcher Milt May
and outﬁelder Ron LeFlore (.297), while
ﬁrst-baseman Jason Thompson (.287) will
help with the hitting chores. Otherwise,

Boyarsky Looks to Starting Spot on Defensive

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Pitt football player Jerry Boyar-
sky considers spring practice
“fairly important,” although there
are times, he says, when he
“would rather be in Schenley
Park” taking advantage of the
warm weather.

“It seems funny practicing

football in the spring, but it has to‘

)9

be done, said Boyarsky, who is
expected to start at defensive

middle guard after missing much of
last season with injuries.

“Coach Jackie Sherrill always
says that the team is made in the
spring,” Boyarsky added. “I have
to agree. You have to have a good
spring practice, especially if you
want to win a position.”

Boyarsky apparently has already
“won his position.” The six-foot-
three, 260-pound sophomore from
the Scranton area is expected to
start when Pitt opens its season

Sept. 15 against Kansas at Pitt
Stadium.

“I’ll probably start, but you
never can tell,” said Boyarsky, who
spent his first two seasons backing
up Dave Logan at middle guard.
“They’re bringing in a lot of
freshmen.”

“Right now, Dave Bucklew and
Kurt Brechbill are backing me up,”
Boyarsky added. “They’re switch-
ing a lot of people around. I’ll have
to see what happens.”

Boyarsky was bothered by a bad

ankle last season and never really
showed the ability that allowed him
to start seven games as a
freshman.

“It was disappointing,” he said.
“After the kind of freshman year I
had, I was looking forward to last
season. But I got injured so early
(during the second game) and I
went into a sophomore slump,
which you hear so much about.”

Boyarsky did, however, start the
last four games of the season,
including the Tangerine Bowl.

Friday, March 30, 19‘79—Puge 11

Line
when defensive left tackle Greg
Meisner suffered an injury.

Boyarsky is optimistic heading

_ into the upcoming season.

“I hope I can bounce back and
play at the level that I think I can
play,” he said.

Boyarsky’s ankles are both
healthy (he broke his left ankle in
the Gator Bowl two years ago), but
now he has another problem. He
missed practice last week because
of a strained neck ‘muscle.

Roommates Battle for Newbom Volleyball Team

BY ANNA ARLOTTA
‘ Pitt News Staffwriter

When the Pitt mens’ volleyball
team meets the University of
Rochester and Allegheny College
tomorrow at Trees Hall, Panthers
Jeff Beavers and Scott Hoffman
will be in the starting lineup. The
two, who are roommates, have
come a long way since the team
began, even though Pitt captain
Hoffman only began playing
organized ball last year.

After running track for two years
at Pitt-Johnstown, Hoffman didn’t
want to commit himself to one
varsity sport upon arrival at Pitt.

“I decided that I would just play
intramural ball to stay in shape,”
Hoffman said, “until I joined the
mens’ volleyball club last year. I
had never really been exposed to
volleyball except in gym classes. I
liked it, though, and I had one year

of eligibility left, so I decided to 9

come back and play.”

Beavers began playing volley-
ball as a freshman at Penn Hills
High School. He took up the sport
to keep active. During Beavers’
four years of high school volleyball,
his team competed in state
championships and ended up in the
top five in the state each year.

“When I first came to Pitt, all
there was in the line of volleyball
was a club team,” Beavers said.
“There was seven to ten people on
the team and we used to compete
against local teams like C-MU,
Slippery Rock and Edinboro. Every
weekend we would play tourna-
ments with all the teams in the
league. At the end of the season,
we won the league championship.”

Now that the Panthers have been
allowed to go varsity this year,
what do Hoffman and Beavers
think of their first year of
competition?

‘ ‘The big thing is that the team is
young and inexperienced and until
this year we had never worked to-
gether. It takes a while to mold a
team. Our performance has been
like a yo-yo. We play well and we
‘play bad. I don't think that we have
reached our potential as a team.”

Hoffman agrees.

“We are young and inexper-
ienced and we aren’t big in size like

so ‘many teams that we compete
against. Also, there are problems

of beginning teams adjusting to
working together.”
“Recruits are important.
year, with some good ones, we’ll be
a much better team,” said

Next '

Beavers. “We’ve got our feet on
the ground and we have estab-
lished the program. I’m looking
forward to next year becaus_e_ I
know we will be ‘a hell of a lot
stronger.” '

Hoffman will not return next
season because he is graduating
but he sees improvement for the
Panthers.

“They (the Panthers) will have a
good base with which to start—J eff

Yaitees Talent Target

(Continued from page 10)

Tiger fans will be hard pressed to ’

find a hitter close to .300.

Pitching is another Detroit
problem. Without Fydrich, plus
the loss of Slaton to Milwaukee, the
Tigers will have to count on veteran
Jack Billingham (15-8) and young-
ster Dave Rozema (9-12) and last
year’s surprise Milt Wilcox (11-3),
best remembered in Detroit as
Fydrich’s replacement. That’s not
a very good starting rotation to
base pennant hopes on.

I John Hiller (9-4) is the bullpen
ace, but the Tigers need more that
that to relieve a shaky pitching
staff.

(Beavers), Scott Robbins and Arnie
Matthews, along with some good
recruits. This is a beginning
program at Pitt and I think a lot of
high school players will see that
places are open and become
interested. ’ ’

The Panthers played the Univer-
sity of Rochester last week in New
York and were defeated.

“Rochester is a beatable team,”

CLEVELAND

The Indians are a graveyard of
once-good-pitchers-who-faded-
into-mediocrity. Remember such
names as Wayne Garland (last
year’s supposed free agent
pitching wonder), David Clyde
(rookie sensation at the age of 19
three years ago) and Rick Wise
(Boston Red Sox pitching star two
years ago)? Together, they have a
won-lost percentage of 19-34.

The pitching staff will have to
perform up to expectation for the
Indians to move up from sixth
place. Otherwise, it could be last

A place for the Tribe.

said Beavers. If we play a
half-decent game, we can go 2-0
tomorrow and beat Rochester‘ and
Allegheny. ’ ’

“I agree,” said Hoffman. “We
can beat Rochester. Last week we
could have beaten them. If we play
the brand of ball we are capable of,
we can win.” Starting time for the
tri-match will be at 1:00 in Trees
Hall.

forTeams 

TORONTO

Yet another year of building for
the third-year Blue Jays. There’ll
be some improvement, but last
place will probably be the result
again.

Toronto’s only off-season acqui-
sitions were Cleveland pitcher
Dave Freisleben (1-7) and Houston
hurler Mark Lemongello (9-14),
both of whom are needed to shore
up a potentially ﬁne starting
rotation. Jerry Garvin (4-12) had
an off year and is needed to be the
pitching leader. Jim Clancy (10-12)
performed well, earning 10 wins on
a losing ballclub.

20 Pitt Traoksters Open semi
With Iﬁrginia Invitational Meet

The Pantherette track team
opens its outdoor season today at
the University of Virginia Invita-
tional. Twenty runners, throwers

V and jumpers will compete for Pitt

Bowie to
Kentucky

Lebanon High School’s 7-1
center, Sam Bowie,» will attend
the University of Kentucky this
fall, says Bowie’s coach, Chic
Hess.

Bowie was this winter’s most

sought-after recruit and had
narrowed his choices to Ken-
tucky, Marquette and Nevada-
Las Vegas from over 400
colleges offering scholarships
to the Pennsylvania All-State
player.

Bowie will be in Pittsburgh
for the Dapper Dan Roundball
Classic next month.

 

against schools from Virginia,

Maryland, Pennsylvania and North’

Carolina.

“This being our first time down
to Virginia,” said coach Alfreeda
Goff. “We don’t know exactly what

kind of competition to expect. All

we can go by is the results from last
year’s meet, which were very
good.”

Pitt will go mainly with its relays
and field people today. Gwen
Murray, Pitt record holder in most
sprinting events, is not fully
recovered from a re-pulled ham-
string muscle and will compete in
only one event, the mile relay. Lisa
Haupt, Karen Krichko and Linda
Mitchell and Murray will try to
qualify for both the Penn Relays
meet and Association of Intercol-
legiate Athletics for Women
nationals.

The 440-yard relay of Lisa
Sciullo, Leslie Palmer, Cissy
Wilborn and Mitchell also has
these goals in mind. Jane Strause,
Brenda Chorpenning, Maria Sciullo
and Karen Bradley will compete in
the two-mile relay.

Individual competitors include
Palmer, 100-meter hurdles; Lisa
Sciullo and Dee Dee Kantener,
100-meter dash; Barb Billek, 800
meters; Melanie Nickerson and
Chorpenning, 5000 meters; Wil-
born and Kim Green, long jump,
and Marie Ribik and Krichko, high
jump.

In the throwing events, it will be
Pitt shot put record holder Peri
Jude Radecic and Donna Pang-
burn; Radecic will make her first
attempt to break the Pantherette
discus record today also. Javelin
specialist Carmen Scherich and
Paula Phillips will be participating
for Pitt today in the ﬁeld.

“The purpose of this meet is not
to win,” said Goff. “If we were
trying to win the team title, we'd
have to take a full team down with
us. Right now we’re just interested
in seeing where we stand after our
recent indoor season.”

The Pitt men’s team is also in
Virginia today for its meet
tomorrow afternoon.
