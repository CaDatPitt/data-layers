First Inspection Of Incomplete
truoture To Take Place
Sunday Afternoon

 

Public CampaignBegins

   

The ﬁrst public view of the now
incomplete Commons room and of the
Cathedral of Learning will take place
Sunday afternoon from 4 to 6 o’clock

I when the University will begin open-

house for one week for the public to
view the tall building.

The hours for visitors from Monday
to Friday are 3 to 5 o’clock in the
afternoon and 7 to 9 o’clock in the
evening, On Saturday the Cathedral
will be open for reception of visitors
from 10 o’clock in the morning to 5
o’clock in the afternoon and 7 to 9
o’clock in the evening. The hours set
will not interfere with the holding of
regular University classes. Students
and faculty members of the hospitality
committee will escort the public
through the building.

Monday the Citizens’ committee un-
der Thomas Fitzgerald, will begin the
ﬁrst general public solicitation for
the “Complete the Cathedral” fund.
This committee met Thursday eve-
ning in the Commons room, where
directions and explanations of the
public campaign were given by drive
leaders. It was the first meeting ever
to take place in the large_ Commons
room, which covers oiie-third of an
acre of ﬂoor space, the largest Uni-
versity room in the world,

The Primary gifts committee under
A. E-, Braun, and the -Corporations
committee, under J. C. Trees, have
been meeting regularly in the initial
stages of the appeal and the result of
their work was announced at Thurs-
day’s meeting,

According to Dr. John_ G. Bowman,
Chancellor of the, University, the
present campaign, intended to com-
plete a task for which the public save
more than $8,100,000 in 1925, will be
the last assistance to be asked f0I‘
publicly. It is believed tliat_the build-
ing can be completed within a, year.
Vvith the money to be raised in the
campaign, some $1,650,000, the ﬁrst
twenty and larger ﬂoors can be com-
pleted, including furnishings, while
the upper twenty ﬂoors can be rough
ﬁnished until they are more acutely
needed, at which time the Universlty
will be able from funds of its own
to complete the structure without
further public appeal.

Banquet To Close
Debaters’ Season

 

Record Reveals 53 Contests .By
Men, 36 By Wonieii

In the Heinz House Tuesday eve-

ning, at 6:30 o’clock, the Men's and’

VVonieii’s Debating associations in a
joint banquet will bring to a close
the Pbesent debate season, which has
been ﬁlled with numerous intercolle-
giate and extension discussions.

The Men’s Debating association par-
ticipated in ﬁfty-three debates during
the year. More than half were pre-
sented before Pittsburgh audiences.
In addition to the extension debates,
four forensic jaiints were taken, one
through the Midwestern states as far
west as Chicago, one an invasion of
the Eastern states, and the other two
week—end .tours of the various col-
leges and universities in the Tri-state
district.

The women took part in thirty-six
discussions during the past forensic
season. Only eight discussions were
presented on trips, the rest being be-
fore audiences in the Pittsburgh dis-
trict. Their trips included one as far
north as New York and the other as
far south as Vvashington, D. C.

The season was climaxed with a
speech tournament, which took place
last month. Thirteen colleges from
the Tri-state district took part in
ﬁfty contests during the conference,
which featured after dinner speeches,
extemporaiieous speaking contests and
formal debates. The outstanding fea-
ture of the tournament was the pre-
sentation of the Delta Sigma Rho
gavel to Genevieve Blatt, C33, who
was the general chairman of the con-
ference.

The teams were coached by DI‘-
William M. Parrish. Richard Murphy
and Miss Theresa Kahn.

Air Liner Broadcasts
To Cathedral Top
Sunday Evening

 

A two-story broadcast between
a TWA Douglas air liner and the
top of the 42-story Cathedral of
Learning, will take place Sunday
evening at 10:15 o’clock over
KDKA. The broadcast was sched-
uled for last Sunday night but
was postponed because of weather
conditions. It will last half an hour
and promises to be one of the
most interesting two-way broad-
casts of the year.

The purpose of this broadcast
is to report the distance at which
the lighthouse light beam on top
of the tall building could be
seen. The low ceiling and visi-
bility of less thanamile that was
prevalent Sunday night made it
impossible to carry out’ the pur-
pose of the broadcast. John \V.
Hallock, secretary of the General
Alumni association, will broad-
cast from the air liner,

Psychology Forum Hears
Gray Speak On Emotion

“A Biological Interpretation of
Emotion” was presented before the
Psychology forum by Dr, Stanley Gray,
professor of psychology, Johiistown
Center, at the meeting Monday, May
14.

In his address, D1‘. Gray reviewed
some of the theories of emotion held
by ancient philosophers. Several of
the beliefs were shown to have em-
bodied the fact that emotions were
classified eitlier as pains or pleasures.
Others held that emotional action was
due to disturbances of the visceral or-
gans. As a result of the old theory
that various emotions were caused by
certain organs in the body, operations
{were even performed, in some cases,
to remove these organs.

“The more modern meiitalist,” Dr.
Gray continued, “believes that enio-
tion is the psychic aspect of the physi-
cal processes commonly known as ‘iii-
stiiicts.’ ” He then told of the experi-
ments belng made at present by cheni-
ical ana.lysists,to show the cha.nges in
blood composition. when the individual
is under emotional stress.

Owl For First Time Devotes Greater
Part To Informal Campus Pictures

 

By Helen Rose Gibson
“The trouble with pictures in the
year book,” contended a certain jour-
nalism professor, “is that they aren’t
typical. Vvhen you remember a. pal
from college, you don’t remember him

the way he looked when he got a
haircut for the first time in two
months, and when you’re thinking
over the football game, it’s that ﬁfty
yard run of Joe Zook you want to
live over, not mass picture of the
squad.”

“But say,” blurted out a little blonde
in a. red hat, “To do that, we’d have
to ﬁnd a man with a. camera around
his neck who would dash around the
school at all hours.”

“Just the man I mean,” said the
professor, “and when you ﬁnd his
name and address, send it over to the
Owl.”

They must have found that man
over at the Owl this year, for in
campus pictures throughout the new
edition of the book there has been
captured bits of Pitt life. From the
snapshot of Betty Quarrie and Bill
Piggot ﬁnishing up a milk shake in
Geyer’s drug store to the picture of
Mary Milburn in the dean of men’s
office, the photographs are clear and
characteristic, and in many respects

better than the professional pictures.
Especially artistic is the kaleidoscope
arrangement of pictures introducing
initiation, Sally Sanderson showing
the girls how it is done at bridge, a
delegation of Kappas checking up on

Gyla Stern’s telephone conversation,
Mr. Cass intent on an inspection of
his model theatre. Signiﬁcant and
amusing glances, they form a relief
from solemn conclaves of fraternity
brethren and formal portraits of prom-
inent dance leaders and followers.
For the ﬁrst time in Owl history, the
campus section has not been conﬁned
to two pages of small snapshots, but
has formed the feature of the entire
book.

To Hugh Wagner goes the credit
for ﬁne art work throughout the book,
art work carried out in a carnelian
red that brightens the conventional
black and white of the book. Modern-
istic motifs, and sketches of the Heinz
memorial chapel and Foster hall are
included in the illustrations,

The book opens with a full leiigtli
picture. of Andrew W. Mellon, trus-
tee of the University, to whom the
ibook is dedicated. Senior classes,
jhall of fame, activities, administra-
ﬁtive officers, fraternities and sports

Seniors To Give
Corsage - Favors
At Ball Tonight

Jacobs’ NBC Orchestra Booked
For Summer Formal; Kleeb,
Keown To Lead March

 

 

A notice has been issued by the
committee to Bizad, Dent, College,
Engineering, Education and Pharmacy
seniors and undergraduates that it
would be decidedly foolish for them
to buy corsages for their belles for
tonight's Senior ball,

Not that corsages won't be in order
tonight, they say, because for prob-
ably the ﬁrst time in the history of
Pitt dances every feminine guest will
be wearing one. Tliey’re going to be
given aw'ay—free.

The affair opens tonight at 10
o’clock in the main ballroom of the
Schenley hotel with Merle Jacobs’
Hotel Hollendeii orchestra of Cleve-

"land occupying the band platform, At

2 o’clock the ﬁnal “break” of the or-
chestra will bring to a close the year’s
last student dance.

Final plans call for the Grand
March at 11 o’clock with Howard
Kleeb,. BA, leading the procession, ac-
companied by Miss Katherine Keown
of Pittsburgh. At the conclusion of
the march the corsage—favors will be
distributed. ,

An enthusiastic committee has been
insistent all week in its declaration
that tonight’s Senior ball will attain
that millenium of dances, “tl1e great-
est in Pitt history.” Priced at $3 per
couple, which is a half dollar below
the assessment for last year’s affair,
the ball will‘ be the most inexpensive
of its kind in the last several years.
Added to that, favors, which were cut
out as an economy measure last May,
are being included, and Kleeb claims
tliatthese corsages will prove highly
acceptable to every one.

Jacobs’ band, which comes here
from a long-term engagement at the
Holleiiden hotel in Cleveland, has, for
a nuniber of years, been featured on
NBC broadcasts.ovei' station WTAl‘.l.
The personnel includes fourteen mu-
sicians and a torch singer, who, it is
rumored, has a very captivating per-
sonality.

As was announced Tuesday in the
News, the ball tonight will be “simi-
nier formal,” which means that the
men may dress comfortably, while the
women will still be permitted to dis-
play their formal gowns. The coin-
mittee of ﬁve women and fourteen
men declare that both sexes will be
given the proverbial break from the
standpoint of dress.

Education Seniors Apply _
For State Certificates

graduating this June should, accord-
ing to Tlieodoe A_ Siedle, assistant to
the dean, ﬁle applications for state
teachers certiﬁcates immediately.
This may be done by obtaining the
application form from the Registrar's
ofﬁce. Details about the procedure
may be had through inquiry at the
ofﬁce of the School of Education.

‘‘If the application is ﬁled now,”
Mr. Siedle said, “the whole pro-
cedure will be facilitated and the stu-
dent will receive the certiﬁcate more
promptly." The process requires time
in the ofﬁce of the Registrar for the
preparation of transcripts and in
Harrisburg, where the records from all
institutions must be reviewed to de-
termine the subjects for which the
certiﬁcates are to be issued.

Effluvia

By Saul Weisberg

I have been receiving of late various notiﬁcations from the University to
the effect that I am expected to graduate within a couple of weeks and re-

move my person from the ‘Universit_v"s premises.

These little, rather formal,

letters have impressed me quite forcibly with the fact that very shortly my
pleasant four years of existence here are going to come to an end.
After all, I suppose that the thing I will longest remember about my

college career is the fact that it was¢

pleasurable. In University life, every-
thing seems to lack a certain serious-
ness. a certain practicability. that
make it easy indeed to loaf along with-
out a great deal of worry and without
too many trials. As a whole. the gen-
eral atmosphere in a college is most
conducive to quiet enjoyment and oc-
casional bursts of high-pitched joy.
Furthermore, I was always able to
feel that I was young and healthy with
my future before me.

Now, however, my future has caught
up with me and it's not the best
feeling in the world. I’m no longer re-
nioved a great part of the time from
the life of the outside world. Eco-
nomic problems have taken on a real-
ity that they only occasionally pos-
sessed during the years spent in class-
rooms where we ‘just discussed such
things. In college one has to worry
frequently about how one is going to

support himself or where one is go-.

ing to get money for various schemes,
but still there is a difference. I think.
After all. one can always find various
types of relaxation and can get a cer-
tain sense of security. But, after you
are out. the security usually disap-
pears, I imagine.

And as I face the problems before"

me, I know that they are going to be
difficult to solve. Jobs are scarce and
money is scarcer_ What to do, now
that one has graduated, is a. vital wor-
ry. My best bet seems to be to write
a column called “I/Veekly Letters From
the Bread Line_s, by a. College Gradu-
ate.” The only trouble, here, of
course, is that the competition from
other graduating college columnists
would be terriﬁc. And then there is
this fact to consider, that as soon as
my column was successful. I would no
longer be in the bread lines.

I have another choice. also. I
might help to organize a march of un-
employed college graduates on VVash-
ington. Marching seems to have gone
out of fashion, of late. except the
marching of soldiers and of time. But
I've always wanted to see I/Vashington
and if I investigate the Capital city
in the company of a great many young
fellows like me, all the better. Then
such an unemployed expedition holds
other lures. It has the aspect of a
cooperative venture, something in
which I believe and in which I have
always wa.nted to participate. It is
the lack of cooperation. or rather the

individualism in our society, which
has caused so much damage in the
past

In line with cooperation, it seems to
me that the best thing college stu-
dents of the future can do to prevent
themselves from being faced with
just such problems as confront me is

to organize and take group action. The
anti—war demonstrations which have

been taking place recently are a sign.

of the times. Students are evincing
more interest in social questions than
they have shown in the past. And
they should continue to do so and to
translate‘ their interest and opinions
into deﬁnite actions. Let them make
a real effort to build a. new society,
one which carries within it a real
freedom and security.

For if the future college student
doesn't help in the modern attempt to
bring about a juster commonwealth,
then he will follow in my footsteps
and those graduating with me. He
will have no hope in the future and no
peace in the present.

Lamp-post

By Wilbur D. Clark

T IS THE DESIRE of every small-

time columnist to at least attain
the respect and consideration that is
accorded a real, honest-to-goodness
big-time word juggler.
on a small scale considerably irks real
genius, to say nothing of the dim-
culty that it imposes. Oh to be sent
to Miami on a vacation just to im-
prove my column! and ah for a 1927
Buick and a driver named Eddie to
out and conquer the world, to make
people Clark—conscious! Or if there
was even two or three dogs, blind
Bostons and lame terriers, to write
about, that would make things easier.

As it is, the boss demands a column
and when we ask for a suggestion it
comes promptly: “Take a walk around
the Cathedral; that’ll give you an in-
spiration.” And Heywood got a trip
to Havana, or Egypt, or some where!
But all this is as nothing when one
‘reads the paper and ﬁnds his brain

child maimed by an unsympathetic
editor who insists that “rot” is a
much more presentable word for

what you mean, and explains that
there are some people who might
not like the word that was in the or-
iginal manuscript. To see one’s col-
umn ﬂoating down the gutter or used
to wrap up the garbage, that is life,
but to ﬁnd that one word has been
changed, that, my friend, is butchery.

But, all things considered, even
though our trips consist of a walk

have no dogs, nor Buicks nor drivers
called Eddie, even though our fan
mail has fallen off over 100 per cent,
we do fairly well at ﬁlling a column.
‘Look how much space this has cov-
ered already.
UCI-I MAY BE SAID for breaking
up a column into smaller units
(yes, I know, “and much may be said
for breaking up a columnist into lit-
tle pieces”) for by so doing the
reader is encoura.ged to read the small
bits in hopes that one of the units
may be interesting. A solid column,
such as this, is appalling;
appearance gives the reader little
hope. It is felt, however, that such a
practice in this instance would be a
simple case of an attempt to fool
the public, and so this appears as
it does—and only two of you, my
mother and my girl friend, have read
this far.
P. S.—Thanks, Charley, for reading
the column the last time.

football, basketball, and track teams, which have met Pitt teams in the three

Meet West Virginia At St. Clair
Country Club Today

 

 

Tomorrow at St. Clair Country club
West Virginia will try to avenge the
4-3 setback which the Panthers handed
them at the Mountaineers home
course, April 28. It will be remem-
bered how the Pitt “rookies” Wasco
and Matthews, saved the match for
the Blue and Gold, after both Wolff
and McKee, No. 1 and No. 2 Pan-
thers, had been each defeated for
the first time this year.

The encounter will be determined

by match play and either four or ﬁve
man teams will be used. In the event
that only four men are used, Pitt
will have Regis Wolff, coach and cap-
tain at No. 1, Claude McKee, Tri-
State intercollegiate match play cham-
pion, at the No. 1 post, John Wasco
and Art Matthews at positions No. 3
and No. 4. Should ﬁve-man teams be
used, Sammy Decker will make the
ﬁfth man for the Panthers_

Tuesday at the St. Clair Country
club, the Panthers ran their number
of consecutive victories to eight, by
defeating Washington and Jefferson
5 to 1 in match play. This was the
ﬁrst loss of the year for the Presi-
dents. They had beaten both West
Virginia and Carnegie Tech in pre-
vious encounters.

The only Washington and Jeffer-
son man to win was Guy Butter, who
beat Claude McKee 2 and 1. McKee.
however, teamed up with Regis Wolff
in the first foursome to beat Butter
and John Wayman, 3 and 2. _

In the other singles matches Regis
Wolff defeated VVaYm3-T1. 3 and 23
John Wasco, Pitt, defeated Morry
Libber, 3 and 2; and Art Matthews,
Pitt, beat Pete Drost, 7 and 6. Wasco
and Matthews combined in the sec-
oncl foursome to trim Libber and
Drost, 4 and 3. _

of 75s, turned in by John Wasco and

1932 game, 12 to 0, Krause’s playing
was only overshadowed by the touch-
down runs of Dailey and Sebastian.
Krause blocked both kicks for extra
points, blocked a punt, and played a
bang-up defensive game, Last year
he wound up his Pitt—Notre Dame grid
career by turning in another fine per-
formance.

In Basketball

Krause played center position on
the Notre Dame varsity basketball
team for three years. In his sopho-
more and junior years he was named
on the All-American basketball team.
Krause’s main ability was his execu-
tion of Coach Keogan"s pivot play.
His height, ball handling, and shoot-
ing ability made him an ideal pivot
man. His talent in this play seemed
useless in competition with Dr. Carl-

son’s crack Panther teams. Last win-_

ter Pitt’s All-American center, Claire
Cribbs, kept Krause pretty well under
cover.

In Track

Just to keep himself in condition
Krause takes to track, which is all
well and good for the Irish, for he
stars in the weight and ﬁeld events.
His best event is the javelin. In that

event tomorrow a ﬁrst place for Ed-
ward Krause would certainly be a ﬁt-
ting climax for a ﬁne athlete and a
real sportsman.
