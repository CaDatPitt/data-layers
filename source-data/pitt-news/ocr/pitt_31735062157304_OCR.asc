In Schenley Plaza Places 1 —.

‘ $1600 in City Treasury '

By “PAUL HARRISON
J Almost 1600 Pitt student ‘dollars! have found their way
into the ‘city treasu’ry,.c_lue to a- new parking ban inﬂicted

I on student motorists this summer.

The parking curb, a one-hour restriction authorized by

City Council to insure parking for’

users of the Carnegie Library,
eliminates 32 spaces for student
use opposite the library in the
Schenley Plaza. 1

‘ Despite the new edict, however, -

a’ large number of Pitt students
have continued using the area and
have in turn been issued, parking

tickets’ by-the-Schenley Park P05 ,
' lice.

‘Since registration week the
number of aviolators on the west
side of thehlibrary had. swelled to
approximately 800. At the‘ rate

of two dollars a ticket this adds ‘

up to $1600. _
A One park patrolman estimated
an average of 25 to 35 parking
violations are handed out each day
to commuting students.

‘‘Apparently,’? ‘the oﬂicer ex-
plainecl, “the_students are either
unaware of the one-hour parking

them.”
“they aren’t "guilty or the latter
because I know they don’t have
money to throw away.”

As a word of warning to the
_studen'ts the oﬁicer_’added,- “Al-
though we’ve been refraining A from
being drastic, we are authorized
to either tow ‘these automobiles
away after’ the ticket is on the
windshield or issue a ticket for
every hour after the allotted time.”

$14 a Day

A towing charge in the city
amounts to ten dollars plus the
ticket. The nearest city auto pound

. Also Accept Responsibility

By JOHN De NINNO
Student Congress has signed a “proclamation” which

makes them fully responsible for damages incurred as a re-'

sult of victory rallies.
' The proclamation, drawn
Technology last Thursday by

up at Carnegie Institute of

student leaders and facultyl

representatives from Pitt, Tech,¢
Duquesne, and Pennsylvania Col-
lege for Women, states that each
school’s student government group
will “assume ﬁnancial responsibili-
ty for any damages done,” by stu-

(See Text of Proclarrtatton, P. 3)
However, it adds that if any

individual participating in the
f‘celebrations” is caught doing
damage. he will “bear the ex-
pense.”

Relieves University

In the past the University has
carried the expenses of student
vandalism. The proclamation SC
signed relieves the administration
of this liability and places it up-
on Congress. Money used to pay
for these damages, if and when
they are incurred, will come from
Student Congress funds. If SC ex-
ceeds its budget as a result of this
expense they might possibly be
reimbursed by the University, us-
ing money from student funds, ac-
cording to Theodore W. Biddle,
dean of men.' ' ‘

The proclamation also recom-
mends that the administrations of
the ‘respective schools “deal se-
verely with any students who vio-
late the understanding . . . and
carry on a program" to educate
(these students) to avoid such de-
struction of property.”

Although the resolution was

eventually passed unanimously, it
did not meet with immediate ap-
proval from all of Congress.

Doubts Raised ’ e ,
Certain fearsconcerning the SC
budget and the dampening of
school spirit had to be ‘dispelled
before the Congressmen» would
agree to the signing. Lou McCul-
lough, ‘appointments chairman,
questioned the factithat Congress
could afford such an added ex-
pense. His concern was shared by
Emil Herman and by Stanley
Greenfield, publications board‘rep-
resentative of SC. 1

Ross Reese, SC president, said
that “SC has gone into the red
before but the University has al-
ways made up the difference.” He
was backed by Dean Biddle.

Last year Congress was faced
with a $125 bill resulting from
damagesrdone during the Notre
Dame victory rally. However they
did not pay it because they were
billed erroneously. by the Bursar’s
Oﬂice.
ment they will be held to such
expenses. V’

Total Budget of $1600

Charles Elliot, assistant dean of
men, gave the total Congress bud-
get as $1600.. He said,; “The pur-
pose of this proclamation is to get

‘Picked Likely To Succeed‘ in.

High School

Vaughn Monroe, who will add
Pitt to his list when __he brings his
“Camel Caravan” here today was
born in Akron, Ohio, and gradu-
ated from Jeannette, Pa. High
School as “The Boy Most Likely
to Succeed.” While‘ attendinghigh
school, he played for" local bands
and saved enough, to enter Car-
negie Tech. _ '

Vaughn toured the country with

various groups until 1937 when he
joined a band managed by Jack

Marshard in Boston and was pro-

moted to leader.

In the meantime, the tall mu-
sician was studying voice at the
New England Conservatory of
Music. ‘However, when. Vaughn
started to handle the band vocal in
1940, he had to hire a coach to
tone down his boomingcbaritone
for the more intimate microphone
style.

The success of “There. I’ve Said

It Again” in 1945, which sold '

more than 1,250,000 records, es-

hits as: “Let It Snow,” _“Balleri‘-“

|lText ofthe Proclamation I

(See story page 1)
As representatives of our re-
spective institutions, Carnegie In-

University, University of Pitts-
burgh, and Pennsylvania College
for Women, we‘ express concern
over the fact that on occasions in
past years certain members of our
student body have ‘visited other
institutions in connection - with
athletic celebrations -with conse-
quent interruptions to the educa-
tional program and destruction of
property. We express the hope
that such activities will be discon-
tinued in the future.
-Accordingly, we resolve and
recommend to the leadership, fac-
ulty and students at our respective
institutions that in instances .of
visitation to other campuses we

assume ﬁnancial responsibility
for any damage done, with the ex-
pense, in so far as it can be es-
tablished, to be borne by individ-
uals identiﬁed as participants.

We further recommend to the
Administrations of our respective
institutions that they deal severe-
ly with any students who violate
the letter and spirit of this .un-
derstanding. To assure the success
of the _above resolution, we pro-
pose that our respective institu-
tions carry on a program of edu-
cation for’ the students in this re-
gard.

We further recommend that all
possible publicity be given this
action at the different institutions,
and that it be approved and ef-
fected by our respective student
governments.” at

Pitt Readies
Argue Guns

_ Pitt may have its chance for re-
venge this year-against the Moun-
taineers of West Virginia, but it
won’t be on the gridiron.

The Mounties have challenged
the Pitt debaters to a verbal en-
counter Oct. 27-29 before ten city
and district high schools on the
question, “Resolved: The President
of the United States should be di-
rectly elected.’

This second invasion from the
South should turn into a slugfest
for both Pitt and WVU are con-
sidered powerhouses. Pitt will
wheel out its heavy" artillery from
last ‘year’s state championship
team. The big‘ guns are Ross
Reese, Al Boll, Paul Petro, Elmer
Schuster, Irving Bloom, ~ and Dan
Purdy.

Debate for High Schools

The battles will take place be-
fore an estimated total audience of
9,000. At the conclusion of each
debate, shift-of-opinion ballots

will be passed out to the audience V

to see what effect the debate had
on the listeners.

Men’s Debate Team has an-
nounced that Pitt will return the
courtesy next year and this may be
the beginning of a, new intersec-
tional rivalry.

Stay With Fraternities

The West Virginians will be the
guests of campus fraternities for
their stay here and will travel to

Yes, a few cheers were on the agenda and. the Pitt

that arouses feeling and emotion and spirit, should be a

Generally speaking, we hate to beat our own.

drum, since self-praise is so obvious and such a
good weapon for inciting ridicule and hostile feel-
ings. But last week we received a small, ﬁat par-
cel from the "Associated Collegiate Press that con-
tained the Pitt News equivalent of a ﬁnal grade in
a four—credit course. w
The object in question was
the newspaper rating booklet
and results of the ACP Critical
Service scorebook. _Modestly,'.
and with pardonable pride, we’d
like to announce that last sem-
ester The Pitt News again placed _
in the “All-American’.’ category 3

sible mark in the grading system and since only
four other newspapers achieved this rank, we’re

‘pretty darn happy about the whole thing.-

Explanaﬁon But No'l' Defense _

In mentioning the fact, that The News re-
ceived this award, we‘ would like to clear up a
few points that have been questioned when the
News received similar _ratings. . We have been
accused of forsaking school spirit, ignoring small
organizations, and playing favorites with one or
more campus "groups. It has beenisaid that the
News is made up of .bunch of narrow—minded peo-
ple who live in a little world of their own and

_would poison their pet canary for the- sake of a

story and the subsequent “All American” that
would reward the canary-poisoning story and Oth-

ers of like 111:. -

Actually, the’ ﬁrst consideration that goes into_
the scoring of a college newspaper is its service
to the university and its general all-around "quali-
ty. This phase of the grading is a major part of the
ultimate score and is determined by a check for

I have a sense of guilt and shame that is very
real and perhaps I should not write about it. But,
then, maybe a written confession will help to
ease the feeling. » _

I have read and heard much about the inse-

any moment "the bomb might fall--atom, hydrogen,
cobalt—destroying us or maim-
ing us’for the rest of our lives.
Young men must march off to
the‘Army (or Navy). We may
be faced soon with another de-
pression. “We have nothing to
look forward to” seems to be the
general opinion. '

News received top honors. ‘

Four-Poinf Score Basis -

The criterion for grading is then broken down
into four categories: News Value and‘ Sources,
News Writing and Editing, Headlines, ‘Typography
and Makeup, Depaftment Pages and Special Fea-
tures. We received a mark of “excellent”, or “su-
perior” on all ‘phases except the third category.
Here we were criticized for inconsistent quality
of pictures and inside page makup; but we still
rated nothing lower than one .“very good” com-
mendation.  V

One other item that caught the eyes of the
judges in a negative manner was our policy of

.occasionally running sports ‘stories of interest on

the front page. Last year’s editor, John Kulamer,
and Sports Editor Boris Weinstein agreed that
football stories and pictures could and should be
run on the front page immediately prior to‘ a
home game. They also managed to include late
basketball stories on the same page. . a

done to excess, and we plan to continue the prac-

If you have an opinion on.this matter, please
take a few minutes to drop a note, postcard, or
letter to The Pitt News Office, 825 C1, stating your
thoughts on the issue. These replies can be dropped

thedral or left in the News office. We’ll try to

Could Be a Rumor

Could it be (and I hope I am not being op_ti_mis- /’ I
tie) that the insecurity feeling we" hear/"solmu.ch

about is just arun-away rumor? Perhaps‘ itlwas
started as a surmise by a zealous. psychologist.

If this is the case concerning "insecurity, then
it seems that our precious freedom of the press
has turned against us. Through it, we have become
implanted with a false sense of insecurity, and-this
is wrong. - Those opinions held by the few are syn-

nothing to live for. As Dorothy Thompson said in

We would also like to quote

an issue following a pep rally
similar to the one held Friday.

“Since the administration had

Only Top
To Study

Students 
in Oslo 

_ By NANCY SCHOR _ ’ -
Only top students can survive the four or ﬁve six-to-
twelve-hour exams to enter the University of Oslo, N orway’s
only university. That accounts for the great difference be-
tween the typical students privileged to attend American
universities and colleges and Norwegian scholars, explains

Miss Emily Irvine, who spent this:

past summer at the University of-
Oslo studying Norwayfs education-

val system.

‘Studies for Eleven Weeks

Thanks to the Schaefer Award,
a $700 fellowship - available to
members of the Pitt faculty who
wish to better understand the Nor-
wegian people, Miss Irvine,. for
twenty-ﬁve years a member of the
English department here at Pitt,
spent eleven weeks studying and
traveling through Norway, Sweden
and Denmark. -

Along_ with 200 others from
England, France, Scotland, Bel
gium and Yugoslavia, Miss Irvine
found many differences between
education here and in Norway.

Condensed Study .

Not only is it more difficult to
get into the Norwegian university
—many are forced to go abroad to
study-——bu't once they have passed
the rigorous exams, the young
Norwegian has at least ﬁve years
of concentrated study, unbroken
by extracurricular interests like
ours, before he can get a bacca-
laureate degree.

First, a student chooses a major
project for 2 years of study. For
instance, his project may be me-
dieval history. He does not have
to attend the various lectures
given on the subject, but must
study all related ﬁelds-medieval
art, economics, religion and music.
Then he presents himself to a
board for an exam.

After passing this, the young
scholar goes back to studies of
two other projects, each "for at
least a year and a half before he
gets his degreeflf a teaching‘.Ina-
jor, he must in addition have a
third minor project.

This educational system holds
true at the University of Oslo;de-
partments of Humanities, Science,
Law, Medicine and Theology and
the technical schools" for students
of business administration, engin-
eering, dentistry and agriculture.

Oslo U. Has Stiff‘ Entrance

To pass the University of Oslo,
exams one must study, for ﬁve
years at a gymnasium. In prepa-
ration for other schools, students
go for threeyears to a “realskole”
where they can learn about home
economics——from ironing to caring
for a baby, shipbuilding, and auto
mechanics. ’

The other secondary gchqol, es-

pecially for children of farmers

and ﬁshermen, lasts for only a
few months of ,,the year.
Besides’ attending lectures and
visiting these different -types of
secondary schools, Miss Irvine
learned much fromthe Norwegian
people she met through letters of
introduction from members of
Pitt’s Norwegian Room committee.
In fact, she feels she proﬁted
through discussions with "people

'to as great a degree as she did

through. class lectures, where no
discussion was allowed.
Life Is Simple

Miss Irvine found that although

the - Norwegians live a much

simpler life than we do, ' they ,

don’t miss the electric refrigera-
tors and other comforts we ﬁnd
necessary. Norway’s socialized
govermnent taxes radio-, requires

does most of the building. There
is little wealth ‘because of the
“high, high taxes,” but everyone
makes a living. A

In spite of these inconveniences,
there are no slums in Norwegian
cities. In the middle of Oslo, Miss
Irvine found miles of parks where
she spent her spare hourshiking
and picking berries. 'The homes,
usually. built for two or more fam-
ilies, all have.ba1conies with ﬂow-
ers and well-equipped playgrounds
for children. —

Mountains From the Sea

She. was impressed by the
beauty of the Norwegian country-
side, Where mountains rise straight
up from the sea. Parents often tie
their children to trees to keep them
from falling over precipices.

“Norwegian bus drivers,” she
adds, “are to be admired, because
they often back down for miles
on hairpin curves to let‘ cars pass
down the road.” ‘

P. A. System Available

Student Congress is sponsoring
the rental of a_ sound ﬁlm pro-
jector and public address system
for $2.50 and $5 respectively.

Interested students should con-
tact Jack Hardman in the Dean of
Men’s oiﬁce, at least three days
before the event takes place.

as drills began for the contest with Nebraska.

,'Dawson evidently was very pleased with his team’s

over the previous game,’.’ Of
course, he followed up, “you can’t
expect improvement like that

every week.” . .

though, as the Panthers came out
of the Sooner game in very good
physical condition and with an
offense that clicked on the ground
as well as in the air. . -

Henry Ford and Pete Neft al-
ternated at the quarterback spot
with both showing good form; so
the head coach says he will,stick
with these twofor the Cornhusker
contest. ' ' v

The duo combined to lead th
Blue and Gold to? 18" ﬁrst downs
while the front wall held the Soon-
ers _to six, and only one in the
last three periods. -

Dick Deitrick and Ed Johnson
were the stalwarts on defenseand
bulldozer Bobby Epps the offen-
sive giant as he gained more on
the ground than the whole Okie

IM Football

By JOE MONTUORO

The touch football meeting held
at Ellsworth Center Wednesday
saw forty—seven enter the Intra-
mural League. According to Di-
rector Leo Bemis, “it was a normal
turnout.” Actual play will begin

. at Schenley Oval today with the

social fraternities utilizing all the
ﬁelds.

separate divisions, with eighteen
social fraternities making up the

majority’ of the league, being_

broken down into two sections
with nine teams in each section.

Independents will ﬁeld eight
teams, while professional fraterni-
ties have entered six. The unusual
Electrical Engineers have bolted
from the regular past procedure by
forming their own league which
will be comprised of four! teams.

This is unique in that it is the_

ﬁrst time any department has
formed its own league, with the
result that the eliminations ,will be
fast and furious. There are two
senior teams which look to be fav-
ored to defeat ‘the lone junior and
sophomore team in that league.

Director Bemis informed the
team managers of the slight
changes in the‘ rules, although, as
he says, “there has been no radical
change in the rules and we will
adhere to the rules that were laid
down last year.” The teams will
play two-platoon ball if they de-
sire. However, no graduate will
be allowed to take part in the
games. ' -.

Westminster, in its last sea- 9

son showing against the Olson-
men,‘ was defeated via the ‘shut-

out route, 15-48. Delaware was
. not on the 1952 card.

A quartet of harrier distance
men tied for ﬁrst place to climax
a comparatively easy morning
last Saturday as they clobbered
the Geneva Covies, 15-50. Don_
DelliGatti and Dan Sommer, co-
captains of the squad, together‘
with “Gundy” Gunderson and
Walt (Shootin’) Starz, completed
their dash around the Schenley
Park course in 23-28.

Before the meet, Coach Carl Ol-
son gave his boys his now well
known team strategy, “Keep to-
gether.” As a result, the galloping
four. did just‘ that and ’ emerged
with their ﬁrst triumph in their
ﬁrst outing. . ‘

Bob Cherry culminated the
shutout. as he crossed the tape
at 23:45, placing ﬁfth. Ron Sal-
lade and Pete Kress rounded_ out
the varsity members by ﬁnish-
ing at 24:10 and 24:20 respective-
ly. George Jackson, Covie cap-
tain, took eighth place as he
clocked at 25:56. ‘

All?‘ seven thincla-ds ran their

best times of the season in the
-meet. Sallade made the best im-
provement as he clipped a minute
and 31 second from his previous »
trial times. Three others slashed
more than a minute from their
earlier practice runs;~ Sommer cut ,
off 1:3-0, Kress 1:28 and Gunderson F
1:18. ' '
. Student coach Bernie Luteran-
cik, owner of the course record of
22:08.7, commented, “All the "boys
ran a swell team, race even though
the§’d_idn’t have‘ the advantage of
strong competition.”

NOE there was a ghost named Leroy, who lived in a
haunted cottage near a large Eastern university. Every
Friday night, at exactly seven o’c1oCk, he’d slide under the
. door of Baskerville Hall, (the main dorm), and give the students

"all the answers to next week’s quizzes.

This was quite a set up. N o studying, no cramming . . . and
straight A’s_ all term long. But then, one Friday, the hour
came and went. No‘ Leroy! And"the following week, all the
Baskerville Boys got an F on every quiz!

. y The Friday after that, all of Baskerville Hall waited . . .
and waited. But still no Leroy! In high dudgeon, they set oiit
to ﬁnd him. Creeping into Leroy’s haunted cottage . . . the
Baskerville Boys-found him moaning and groaning. “What’s
the matter, Leroy?” they asked. A t’

‘ Leroy wiped ‘a ghostly tear from his
weather’s so "hot, every time I put on a shirt the collar curls
and wilts. I haven’t been out for two _wceks!”,

‘In high glee, the Baskerville Boys hurried to the local
Van Heusen dealer and bought a dozen Van Hcusen Century
Shirts with the revolutionary soft! collar that won’t wrinkle
ever. Regular collars, spread collars. $3195 for whites, $4.95
for colors. “A very good investment,” theythought.

Leroy was delighted. He rewai”ded the boys with all the
answers to the "following week’s quizzes. Two months later,

‘ all the boys from Baskerville Hall had flunked out. Leroy’s
good-looking Van Heusen Century Shirts made him so popular
with the co-“eds, that he didn’t have time for quizzes or answers.

After the _stalemate staged last Saturday atthe Stadium,
a number of reporters, myself included, stepped up to Okla-
homa Coach Bud Wilkinson and asked the obvious question:
How do you compare Pitt with Notre Dame? .

The question was obvious in that here was a coach who

had tackled both teams on successive weekends early in the '

season and who probably h_as the" only ﬁrst hand idea_0f
both their strengths. No one could be ‘better equipped with

down to earth facts than this tall Midwesterner, whose team-

hd been downed by the Irish, 28-21, on a couple of bad breaks,
and had more recently been lucky topescape’ with a tie at
the hands of the resurgent Panthers. ' . *

And although Wilkinson has achieved some note as an
author and public speaker, he had nothing to‘ say in answer

to the question. You couldn’t expect the guy to be gaily talk-

ative when his ﬁrst two‘ games had failed to produce a win
—especially when his record showed only four losses in the
last 37 games. I _ ' ' A
No Comparison ,

All he said was, “There’s no
it. just can’t be done.” .

Why he wouldn’t discuss the issue is not difficult to "un-
derstand, though. If he said that Pitt was tougher, readers
would naturally expect Red Dawson’s Panthers to .- go. up to
South Bend and lick the Irish. 'A setback would make Daw-
son and the Panthers look bad-——unnecessarily. If he ad-
mitted, on the other hand, that Notre Dame was the stiffer
foe, what excuse might he have for losingto them while

This all seems to hinge on comparative strengths remain-
ing constant throughout the season, but still, his having made
any statement at all would loom up later in the readers’
hindsight-and could prove embarrassing.

. ' ‘ He's Happy‘

A few moments before, he and Dawson had sat on the
dressing room bench wearing wrinkled frowns, like two or-
phans—mulling over what might have been but never was—
and it came to mind that a tie game was a doubly sad af-

_ 7 So, as he prepared :5 leave, I offered, “It’s too bad neither
of us could win it.” E .
He was quick to" reply, “Don’t worry, we’re happy.”
Come" to‘ think of it, remember how the sooners practi-
cally froze the ball instead of gambling for a score on their

Nixon Fare Satisfying:

For Theater Season;
lHarrison Team Stars

By HENRY LANGE -

The curtain has risen for another season at the Nixon
and judging from the list of future offerings and the play
seen there this week, it promises-to be a star-studded success.

‘The play, “The Love of Four Colonels,” is a humorous

fantasy written by English actor and playwright, Peter‘

Ustinov (England’s answer to Or-
son Welles) who is best known to
American audiences for his por-
trayal of “Nero in .‘Quo Vadis.”

y Stars Harrison Team

~_ ‘The charming and sophisticated
“couple, Rex Harrison and his wife,
Lilli Palmer, live up to all the ex-
pectations of this writer. Mr. Har-
rison is as witty and relaxed on
stage as any gentleman in a draw-
ing. room. His timing, deliverance
of lines and all aroundiportrayal
of the supernatural character is
superb’. Miss Palmer must share
these ‘honors with her husband but‘
she alone is the star in'the ﬁeld of
beauty. - ’ ‘ ~

The play is based ‘on the ancient 4

legend of the sleeping beauty and

‘ takes place in 1950; the locale, a
"castle in a disputed area of Ger-

many, controlled by a joint board
of the four powers. ‘- .
After failing to have the tan-
‘igled mass of vegetation removed
from about the castle, so as to use

it fortheir headquarters, the four
colonels are taken into it by the ~-

wicked and the good fairy. The

‘wicked fairy, who put the curse _,

on the princess, hopes to tempt
the married ofﬁcers intoseducing
the beauty. The good fairy hopes
to spoil his game. I

~ Try for Seduction

The princess fell into her sleep
while performing in a play, so
each officer has the choice of a
period in their nation’s history to
act the role of a seducer. The
beauty will be transformed into
their ideal of womanhood. The
wicked fairy will portray a char-
acter in each‘ play to assist each
colonel in his desire, while the
good fairy will hinder them.

The __Frenchman chooses the
loose-living 18th century of Louis
XIV, the Englishman a knight of
the 15th’ century, the Russian a
pre-revolutionary nobleman and
the American a minister of the
present day. Each fails to seduce
the beauty.

' ' Pahner is Beauty

They now have the choice of re-

maining, to sleep for a hundred

years and try again at that time

_ or to return to their natural lives.

The‘. American and Frenchman

remain and are lain beside the
-sleeping beauty.-
