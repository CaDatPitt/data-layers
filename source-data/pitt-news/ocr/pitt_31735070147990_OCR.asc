State Senate,

Housepass Pitt
appropriation

The Pitt News Staﬁ’

Pitt will lose almost one ﬁfth of its
state funding this year unless the gov-
ernor vetoes the appropriation —
leaving the question of tuition hikes
hanging in the air.

The two halves of the state leg-
islature passed thevUniversity’s ap-
propriation Tuesday, allotting Pitt 19
percent less state funding than last
year. Both chambers have separate
bills, and one needs to be decided on P
and signed by Gov. Tom Corbett by
June 30, but both bills state the same
thing: Pitt will receive $136 million in
state—appropriated funding.

Unless the governor vetoes the
bill,-Pittwill receive almostaﬁfth less
state funding this year than it did in
the" last, when it picked up $168 mil-
lion. . ‘

Paul Sup owitz, a Pitt govemment-
relations official, said Tuesday that it
would be inappropriate to comment
on what the funding cut means for

Pitt—‘-speciﬁca1ly,whatit means for‘ V

the rise in in-state tuition.

“It’s been suchaprocess,Withsuch.
twists and turns,” Supowitz said.

Pitt’s Board of Trusteesdid not
pass abudget at its meeting last week
— explicitly waiting on state ﬁinding.
However, Pitt’s vice chancellor for
budget and controller, Art Ramicone,
said thatthe budget committee would
likely decide on tuition at its meet—
ing July 8. He declined to speculate
at Fridays meeting on what tuition
increases might be. ’

University officials have previ-
ously said that the less funding Pitt
receives, the more in-state tuitionwill
rise. And in addition to state cuts, Pitt
will also lose more than $20 million
in federal stimulus ﬁ1nd_s for the next
ﬁscal year. ‘ '

When Pitt made its original ap-
propriations request to the Common-
wealth last September, it said it would
cap tuition increases at 4 percent if
the state increased the institution’s
ﬁmding by 5 percent. But unless the
governor vetoes the 19-percent cut,
Pitt’s ﬁindingwill go down, meaning
tuition will likely rise more than 4
percent. .1

The 19 percent cut for Pitt’s state-
appropriated funding is a compro-
mise among Corbett’s original 54
percent suggested cut, the Senate’s <
15 percent cut and the House’s 25 per-
cent funding—reduction proposal.

Pennsylvania provides some sup-
port to four state-related universi-
ties —— Pitt, Temple University, Penn
State University and Lincoln‘ Univer-
sity — in exchange for lower tuition
for in-state students. '

The House vote came after a
reversal byVDemocrats blocked the
bﬂl’s passage Monday. The funding
for state-related universities requires
a two-thirds vote to pass — mean-
ing that minority Democrats could
hold up the appropriation, but not the
overall budget. The representatives
had disputed the cuts for state-related
universities, but_Democrats eventu-
ally voted to passthe bill.

David Epperson bolstered Pitt’s School of Social’
Work to a place of national prominence during
histimeasdean, andhediditwithasmilethat
could brighten any room, said those who knew

himbest. ’

The 76-year-old dean emeritus passed away

Monday,]une20,leavingbehindalife-longlegacy ,

of commitment to improving social conditions
not only at the University and in Pittsburgh, but
also around the world.

“Three things were key to myfather,” Epper-
son’s oldest daughter, Sharon, said. “Faith, family
and providing a foundation for education.”

The son of Donora, Pa., steelworker Robert
Epperson and homemaker Bessie Tibbs Epper-
son, David once humbly described himselfin an

interview with the International Child and Youth ’

Care Network as “just a country social worker.”

“Myfather did not growup with any money,”
Sharon said. “But he was richer than Bill Gates
because he had afamily that loved him and sup-
ported him.”

That love and support inspired Epperson to
an academic career that would go farbeyond his
fatheﬁs third—grade education. He earned four
degrees from Pitt between 1961 and 1975 ~ a
bachelor’s degree in political science in 1961, a
master’s degree in social work in 1964, a master’s
in political science and international affairs in
1970 and, in 1975, a Ph.D. in political science
and public policy.

Epperson served as dean of the School of
Social Workfor 29 years.Atthe time ofhis retire-
mentin2001, hewasthelongest-servingdean at
Pitt and the longest~serving dean of anyAmerican
school of social work.

’ During Epperson’s tenure as dean, enroll-
ment for the school more than tripled and its
ranking rose to the top 10 percent of accredited
graduate social work programs in the country.
These achievements led Pitt to name Epperson
asthe ﬁrst endowed chairinthe School of Social
Work. _ ~-

He also worked to expand and strengthen
the services offered by the school. He chartered

Throughouthis lifetime, Epperson focuseda

Board of rustees does not pass budget at meeting  

Mallory Grossman
News Editor

Pitt will wait at least 10 more days
to pass its budget — including the
rise in tuition rates. The Univer-
sity decision will wait until the state
has ﬁnalized an amount for Pitt’s
ﬁmding.

Although Friday’s annual Board
of Trustees meeting did not include
a budget, Art Ramicone, Pitt’s vice
chancellor for budget and control-
ler, said that the budget will most
likely be passed on July’8 at the
Board of Trustees’ Budget Commit-
tee meeting. He did not give an es-
timate of what the tuition increase
would be.

Chancellor Mark Nordenberg
took much of the Friday meeting to
discuss the impending cut in rela-
tion to Pitt’s state funding and the
state’s reliance on Pitt to educate
its residents. The Board did not
pass a budget and has not at the
annualjune meeting in many years.
The Board members are waiting
for the state legislature to pass its
budget. '

The state has a constitutionally-

mandated June 30 deadline for its
budget, but the state has continually

blown past the deadline in the past .

10 years — sometimes by months._
But it looks like the state might meet
the deadline this time around.
The Senate and House have
agreed on 19 percent cuts to state-
related universities, which means
that Pitt will suffer a cut in state

V appropriations and in-state stu-

dents will pay the price intuition
increases. I -

Regardless of the amount of
ﬁmding the state decides to cut,
Pitt will lose more than $20 mil-
lion in federal stimulus funding
that it received starting in 2009.
Pitt received $184 million in total
in 2010.

Pitt spokesman Robert Hill said
that it would be unsuitable to talk
abouthow the University is going
to deal with the impending ﬁmding
cuts and the drastic reduction in
state appropriations until the state
budget is passed. He also declined
to comment on whether the major-
ity of the burden will fall on stu-
dents or whether there will be cuts

Port Authority will not cut

service, increase faresuntil 2012

Brendan Owens
For The Pitt News

C Students won’t face more cuts to

transit services many of them rely
on, at least in the next year.

The Port Authority passed its
budget for the next year on Friday,
which kept service, stafﬁng and
fares at the same level until next
summer. The board of the transit

’ authority set the operating budget

at $370.2 million beginningjuly
1, a 3.8 percent increase from last
year. The budget will preserve fares
and staffing levels throughjune 30,
2012.

But after that date, Port Author-
ity riders might see more drastic
cuts than the 15 percent service re-
duction earlier this year. Heather
Pharo, a spokeswoman for Port

Authority, said that if thelstate

does not provide reliable and de-
pendable funding that grows with
inﬂation, the deﬁcit in 2013 will

be at least $30 million and require
even deeper cuts to the budget than
the March cuts. ‘ "

Disgruntled customer and re-
cent Pitt graduate Mary Jessell is
upset about the March cuts and
hopes that more aren’t on the
way. . -

“They already cut all of the bus
lines,” Jessell, who lives by Carn-
egie Mellon, said. “I don’t- have -a
bus to my house anymore, so I have
to ‘walk three-fourths ‘of a mile to
get to Pitt next year when I come
back, so as long as they don’t cut
anymore bus lines  I’m just hop-
ing they will make changes within
that year-span.”

Pharo said that the city could
be looking at service cuts that are
much larger-than those from March
if the funding crisis isn’t resolved
by next year.

“Basically we are very grate-
ful for the emergency fund-
ing  however, Band-Aid solu-
tions don’t work,” Pharo said.

Last year, the Department of Trans-

portation rejected a Pennsylvania V
' plantosettollingonlnterstate80,to

fund the Port Authority, leaving the
agency in a funding limbo that the
legislature_has not since resolved.
To keep the fares and employment
steady for 2012, Port Authority
used $40 million in one-time rev-

enues from reserve funds and the e

emergency funds given to them by
former Gov. Ed Rendell in Decem-
ber. Only $10 million in reserve
funds remain. V

“Spending that money is what
is enabling us to keep service
throughout the rest of [ﬁscal year]
2o12,” Pharo said.

Pharo couldn’t say whether Port
Authority would use the remain-
der of the emergency funds toward
next year’s deﬁcits.

“We are really concentrat-
ing on advocating for funding,”
Pharo said. “Certainly, the deﬁcit

Obama visited    
Carnegie Mellon

Alex Oltmanns
Assistant News Editor

President Barack Obama made a

stop in Pittsburgh Friday at Car-
‘-negie Mello’i1’s National Robotics

Engineering Center to discuss the
importance of manufacturing to
the U.S. economy.

Obama toured several different
venues at CMU to view state-of-the-
art inventions such as a high-tech
combat vehicle and newly created

‘ robots that will be used for manu-

facturing j obs.

He praised the school and the
city for being innovators in manu-
facturing and helping to lead the
way in new technology in a con-
tinual effort to revive the nation’s
economy.

“Carnegie Mellon is a great ex-
ample of what it means to move
forward. At its founding, no one
would have imagined that a trade
school for the sons and daughters
of steelworkers would one day be-
come  one of the region’s largest
employers and a global research

university,” Obama said at the
event.

“And yet innovations led by your
professors and your students have
created more than 300 companies
and 9,000 jobs over the past 15

_ years — companies like Carnegie

Robotics.”

His stop in Pittsburgh was part
of a national effort called the Ad-
vanced ManufacturingPartnership,
whose goal it is to help unify in-
dustry, universities and the federal
government to aid the country’s
interaction in the global market.

President Obama — whose plan
is to put more than $500 million
into the project — was joined by
numerous members of the Ad-
vanced Manufacturing Partner-
ship as well as Pittsburgh officials
such as Mayor Luke Ravenstahl,
Allegheny County Executive Dan

vOnorato and Sen. Bob Casey.

“It seems like every time I’m
here I learn something,” Obama
said. “So for those of you who are
thinking about Carnegie Mellon —
it’s a terriﬁc place, and you guys are
doing just great work.” I

The appropriation has been about

past decade.

Budget 4 1

Minority Leaderjay Costa, D-Forest
Hills, said that the Senate Democrats
were still trying to hold out for more
funding, but was unhopeﬁil that they
would get their way. When Tuesday
aftemoon rolled around, House Dem-
ocrats had gotten on board with the
19 percent cuts.

G. Terry Madonna, apolitical sci-
entist at Franklin&Marshall College
in Lancaster, explained what made
the Democrats reconsider the bill
within a few hours.

“Democrats wanted to increase
the ﬁinding, but the Republicans
made it clear that it was 19 percent
or nothing, and this left Democrats
in an unusual position,” Madonna
said. “If they didn’t provide the two-
thirds vote, then the schools would
get nothing.”

‘-‘Since the mid—196os, the state
has had a desperate need to provide
reasonably-priced educational op-

_ portunities,”-Nordenberg said at

the meeting.

V Nordenberg emphasized that
the University was aware of’ the
daunting challenges faced by the
current state administration from
the budget deﬁcit they inherited.

V “The governor and other elect-
ed leaders face diﬂicult budgetary
challenges and Pitt must be willing
to do its part,” he said.

After Nordenberg spoke, the
Nominating Committee elected two
new trustees to’ the board: Roberta

‘Scullin said that Senate Demo- --

crats have been pushing to try and
restore funding to the state—related
universities. They introduced a
number of amendments to the state
budget earlier in the week to try and
increase ﬁmding to Pitt, but Scullin
said the increases were shot down
by Republicans in avote along party
lines.

Democrats had sought more

’ ﬁmdingfor state—related universities

because the universities operate as
“economic_engines inthe cities where
they are located,” Scullin said.

“The key thing is tryingto educate
our workforce, trying to make Penn-
sylvania competitive in the global
marketplace,” Scullin said. “And to
do that, we need a highly educated
workforce.”

A W approach to health Care

Nick Stamatakis
Columnist

Most college kids love Wikipedia.
Covering everything from Luther-
ans to Led Zeppelin, the free, user-
updated encyclopedia is virtually
unmatched on the Web in terms
of breadth and depth. Sorting
through the nonsense, college stu-
dents often ﬁnd a good foundation
for papers and projects.
Wikipedia represents the best

and worst of a bottom—up approach I

to planning. Contributors, in an
unorganized ‘and unrnanaged
fashion, decide what’s important
independently. Compared to tra-
ditional encyclopedias like En-
cyclopaedia Britannica, the Wiki
process is chaotic and frantic, but
nevertheless pretty effective — a
2005 study in the journal Nature
found the two works to have, in
general, comparable accuracy.
And now for something com-
pletely different: health care. Aside
from a small FICA tax on our pay-
checks — for those of us who work
— we don’t interact with Medicare
on a daily basis. But interestingly
enough, the Medicare debate be-

tween Republicans and Democrats
is analogous to the debate, if there

is one, between traditional ency-
. clopedias, like Encyclopaedia Bri-

tannica, and Wikipedia._Through
this prism, one can make some
sense of the state of things in
Washington, and in the process
see thatnobody has a sure—ﬁre plan
to adequately provide care.
Many Republicans, led by Rep.
Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, suggest
managing costs_ the same way

Wikipedia manages information, V

believing fully in the wisdom of the
market. Under Ryan’s plan, Medi-
care participants would take their
limited, government-sponsored
voucher into the market and seek
the cheapest, most efficient health
care options available. Millions of
“health users,” per se, will then
individually make decisions, and
supposedly, through natural se-
lection and within the conﬁnes of
the per capita allotment, the most
bang—for—your-voucher health care
system possible would emerge.
Conversely, Democrats, believ-
ing ﬁilly in the wisdom of central
planning, have the Independent
Payment Advisory Board to control
costs. This is a newly formed body
from President Barack Obama’s

Health Care and Education Recon-
ciliation Act of 2010. Fifteen gov-
ernment employees will determine
how to keep Medicare spending in
check and propose appropriate re-
forms — think the editorial board
of Encyclopaedia Britannica. In

_ this system, health care rationing

and unfair practices are discour-
aged, potentially creating a system
more humane than the rough-and-
tumble Republican plan.

This is, of course, an over-
simpliﬁcation of the plans, and it
relates speciﬁcally only to doctor
and hospital Medicare reimburse-
ments, not to prescription drug
costs. But it nonetheless shows the
philosophical difference in how
both parties want to cut costs, with
the voter as the ultimate judge of
merit.

~ For a Wikipedia method, you
will get a system intrinsically
less fair. According to The New
York Times, less than 15 percent.
of Wikipedia contributors are fe-
male, leading to an imbalance in
the coverage of “feminine” topics.
In a different breach of fairness, a
voucher system will too be natu-
rally unfair to those who consume
more health care. Plus, for very

A MIDWESTERN PIECE‘

Don’t let current events

A  = Mark I(ozlowski
' Columnist

 

Like manyof my peers, recently
I’ve been guilty of not keeping up
with current events. I was out of

the States for almost a month, -

and I’ve spent the subsequent
weeks scurrying about trying to
get settled" into my new apart-
ment.

Yet I felt an acute sense of

withdrawal after being away
from the news. Following cur-
rent events is an old habit from
my,.speech and debate days, and

. it’s a habit more people my age

away from you

should acquire.

There are several excuses
people usually give for being ig-
noramuses about the contempo-
rary. First, that the World is just
too depressing to think about,
and ignorance is bliss. Second,
that keeping up with the news
in faraway places doesn’t make
sense, as these events don’t re-
ally matter. Third, that keeping
up with current events takes an
inordinate amount of time.

It’s fair to say that the world
is a depressing place. All we ever
seem to hear about is an endless
succession of wars,‘ famines,

strikes and ill—conceived celeb-

rity “comeback” tours. It’s tempt-

ing to try to ignore all that. Un- I
fortunately, we can’t. Eventually a I

problem becomes serious enough

that we cannot help but notice it. _

Consider the current economic
crisis. A few years ago, the col-
lapse of the housing market was
all over the news. This was easy
enough to ignore provided your
house wasn’t being foreclosed
upon, you weren’t the president
of a bank or being wiped out
in the stock market. However,
that.bad news has caught up to
us in a big way: About one in 10

technical topics —— such as medi-
cine, incidentally — Wikipedia
has far less accuracy. Establishing
the exact origins of Spaghettios
through anonymous contributions
is one thing, but diagnosing renal
failure is a different thing entirely.
Future consumers might not have

Encyclopaedia Britannica, on

that they document the entire

can sit for years without being

tempts to stay even-handed, hav-

ing a limited number of people
in charge reduces the chance of
mistakes being weeded out natu-
rally.

And so it seems we have the
ﬂaws of both plans. Either the
market attempts to control costs,
leading to a potentially unfair
distribution of resources and an
uninformed populace making in-
correct decisions about their per-
sonal health, or we have a govern-
ment reform that imposes rigid,
top-bottom regulations that are

» inﬂexible and potentially just as of

inaccurate. In both cases, there is
little chance of actual savings. -

ality which cannot be so easily
overlooked.

p The sooner a person knows
that there is a problem or one
down the road, the sooner that
person can prepare —— or at least
not be stunned when problems
occur. Perhaps more importantly,
because our system of govern-
ment allows, nay, requires us to
punish those responsible for re-
cent calamities when we go to the
polls, it is good to know who is to
blame for problems both recent
and dated.

But the news, both good and
bad, doesn’t really matter to
us, does it? Why should we care
that Kingjigme Khesar Namgyel
Wangchuck is trying to democ-
ratize Bhutan? Because in an
increasingly globalized world,

a piece of news in one place can
have impacts thousands of miles
away. When those reverberating
effects ﬁnally hit our shores or
our neighborhoods, those who
haven’t been keeping track of the
news will be entirely blindsided,
and those who see only local im-
pacts will spuriously conclude
that the world makes very little
sense. Or, alternately, they will
be more susceptible to either
incomplete orpatently false ex-
planations of how those impacts
came to be.

Keeping up with the news as
well as its important corollary -
history — is also vital to avoid
careening into a trap into which
many people havefallen —— the
“this time it’s different” or the
“this situation is unprecedented”-

way of thinking. Read enough in-
depth analysis of current events

and it becomes increasingly clear‘

that a lot of the “revolutionary”
and “earth-shaking” events we
are confused by today have in fact
happened in one form or another
throughout history‘. For instance,
if a military coup were to h_ap-
pen in Thailand in the next few
years, I think many people would
be surprised. They shouldn’t be.
Such a coup certainly wouldn’t
be the first, it wouldn’t be un-
expected and it probably would
lead to a period of military rule
that would be relatively short.
Closer to home, the near-collapse
of the automotive industry and
the bailouts that GM and Chrysler
received are not really that ex-
ceptional. This last round of

bailouts marks the second time
Chrysler has been saved by gov-
ernment intervention. And last
but not least, the current fear-
mongering and distrust of China
we hear bandied about these days
sounds similar to earlier carping
about howjapan was unstoppable
and close to buying up America
in the 1980s.

But doesn’t keeping up with
the news take up an awful lot of
time? Perhaps, if you insist on

- reading three newspapers daily

from cover to cover. Yet a half-
‘hour a.day of glancing through i
headlines is not too taxing a task.
How much time do people typi-
cally spend on Facebook anyway?
Couldn’t some of that time be
spent on Google News?

The bottom line is, keeping up

Responsible citizenship requires following news

with current events is vital if our

. generation is not to be surprised

and dismayed when something
too big to ignore pops up. Keep-
ing up with events is also the
ﬁrst part of being a responsible
citizen in a representative de-
mocracy. It can be dangerous to

have a populace that is either ig- '

norant or doesn’t care about the
world around it,‘ as that populace
will not hold decision-makers
accountable for bad decisions,
or worse, will punish the wrong
people at the polls.

_ So although I might have had a
plausible excuse for not following
the news this last month, I can’t
think of too many others.

Consol
Arena ranks
for eco-
friendliness

Sarah Simkin
Senior Staff Writer

The antarctic birds’s usual frolick-
ing grounds might be white, but
the Pittsburgh Penguins’ skating
territory boasts green — technol-
ogy that is. ’

The International Stadium
Business Awards in Barcelona,
Spain, named the Consol Energy
Center a ﬁnalist in the Sustain-
ability category for its achieve-
ments in energy efficiency and
design. Although the arena, which
attracts some of the biggest‘celeb—
rities for concerts, didn’t get the
gold at that ceremony, the direc-
tors consider it an achievement
that the building earned a Gold
LEED certiﬁcation for Leadership
in Energy and Environmental De-
sign.i '

“From a very early stage we
were committed to achieving
LEED certiﬁcation. At the outset
we really didn’t know what level
of LEED certiﬁcation we’d be able
to attain because it’s very difficult
to reach [a Gold certiﬁcation] with
buildings of this size,” Travis Wil-
liams, chief operating ofﬁcer of
the Penguins, said. -

The larger the building, the
larger its carbon footprint tends
to be, so a green stadium-sized
building presented a signiﬁcant
challenge. Leadership in Energy
and Environmental Design certiﬁ-
cation, known as LEED, recognizes
achievement in ‘site sustainability,

— water and energy efﬁciency, in-
door environmental quality, in— T

novation in design process and
pollution—prevention control in
downtown areas, among other
categories. Gold certiﬁcation sig-
niﬁes attaining one of the highest
possible levels of sustainability. V

website.

When the center‘ opened, it
had the only newly developed
LEED-certiﬁcation on an arena
of its kind in the National Hockey
League; several other sports, such
as the NBA’s Orlando Magic, have
since received certiﬁcation or are
working toward it.

The Steel City had precedent
for green innovation long before
the Consol Energy Center broke
ground. At the time of its con-

struction in 2003, the David Law— ,

rence Convention Center held the
ﬁrst LEED-Gold-certiﬁcation for
a convention center and the larg-
est green building in the world.
Other Pittsburgh LEED-certiﬁed
buildings include Point Park Uni-
versity’s dance studio, which was
certiﬁed as" LEED Gold in 2008,
and the WYEP radio station in the
South Side — which was certiﬁed
LEED Silver in 2006.

The Consol’s assistant general 2

manager and director of mar-
keting, Rob Goodman, said that
from the building’s inception,
they sought to make the center
sustainable.

“Sustainability was important
for everyone involved. It’s part of
the Penguins brand to be on the
cutting edge. They want to be a

leader in the community — and
this community does put a lot of
weight behind sustainability and

environmental issues,” he said.

Aurora Sharrard, LEED accred-
ited professional and director of

- innovation for the Green Build-

ing Alliance, a- non-proﬁt that
educates groups about sustain-
able building practices, head the

alliance’s research and provides.
technical support for green build— -

ing projectsin Pittsburgh. She ex-
plained what goes into a success-
ful environmental_project.
.“Good green projects are the
ones that integrate sustainable
building from the very beginning,
and they really did that. They
thought about green innovation,
about technology and about fan

experience -—— and it’s really neat -

to see how all of those things layer
together,” she said. i ‘ ‘
Although the hockey and

E concert arena did not take home

the gold at the Stadium Business
Awards — the award went to the
Air Canada Centre in Toronto

—— its management team is very 7

pleased to have achieved LEED
Gold certiﬁcation. “We are very
excited to add this to the build-
ings’ resumé as another creden-
tial that makes us stand out in the

crowd,” the Consol Energy Cen— ‘

ter’s general managerjay Roberts
said. _

The commitment to sustain-
ability is an ongoing process, and

- the Consol Energy Center staff 4

knows there is room for improve-
ment, Williams said. In the year
since the building has been open,
the arena staff have made small
changes to improve and minimize
the building’s eco-footprint, such

V as making lighting even more en-

ergy—eﬂicient.‘ Next season, the
building management team will
conduct a thermal—comfort survey
of Penguins fans and concert—go—
ers to determine what tempera-
ture patrons prefer in the building
and adjust accordingly. _
But why go through the mo-
mentous hassle of going green‘?
“The simple answer is that it’s
the right thing to do. Anytime you
can do something when you’re
building a major facility of this

- size in a way that is environmen-

tally friendly, that makes good
sense,” Williams said. “It beneﬁts
the community as a whole and
makes good business sense too,
because it’s more efficient and
economical, which ultimately al-
low you to save money, It’s the
best of both worlds.” .

GOING GREEN

How arena

does green

Sarah Simkin
Senior Staﬁ" Writer

The Consol Energy Center planners
made a point to incorporate green
technology asmuch as possible in the

H ~ building and operation of the arena

and concert venue.
Construction
The construction crews prepped
the site in as environmentally friend-
ly a manner as possible, racking up
LEEDpoints before actual construction
even started.As muchasso percent of
nonhazardous materials from prior
construction was reused to save on
emissions fromvehicles bothhauling
away old and importing new materials.
From paints and adhesives to indoor
and outdoor lighting, green materials
and systems were utilized as much as
possible.
Outside
' The landscaping design reduces
water nmoff and the construction in-
corporates innovative plumbing and
mechanical systems for dealing with
storm—water management. These
allowthe center to reduce its water
consumption by up to 40 percent of
what would be typical for a building
its size —— that’s the equivalent of 1.2
million gallons of potable drinl<ingwa—
ter every year —— and helps prevent
contaminants from entering natural
water supplies.
Energr
A portion of the building is sup-
ported by alternative energy sources

suchaswindturbinesandsteam.The ' '

center purchases alternative energy
credits — Renewable Energy Certiﬁ-
cates, orRECs —to offsetthe energy it
mustusefrom nonrenewable sources.
RECs are electricity produced by re-
newable means thatcanbepurchased
to counter-balance non—green tech-
nologies.

Transportation

The center uses several tactics to
promote alternative transportation.
Bike racks are provided for 5 percent
of the building’s occupancy, and park-
ingcapacity is deliberately kept to less
than 5 percent of the building’s capac-
ity to encourage pedestrian and public
transportation. Many of those limited
parking spaces accommodate hybrid

“Call your mother.”
“Lose some weight”, ~

These one-phrase reminders stick out, par-
tially because almost everyone writes them
frequently. One artist also made them a me-
dium for his exhibit on everyday life: its ups,
downs and banalities.

R.L. Tillman, aprintmaker from Baltimore; .

and founder of the blog Printeresting.org,will
show his new exhibition, “While You Were
Out,” now through July 15 at Future Tenant
Art Space in Downtown.

Consisting of three separate pieces, the
exhibition deviates from standard printmak-
ing. Instead of limiting himself to displaying

standard one—dimensional prints, Tillman '

chose to make his exhibit more interactive,
focusing around pieces that viewers can take
home or write on.

“My work explores the vapidity of con-

the way we use language in everyday life. The
three pieces in the show each use text, image
and immersion to involve the viewer in largely
hollow exchanges,” Tillman said.

The artist used boxes, posters, leaﬂets
and ﬂiers to create his pieces. One piece, ti-
tled “Aphorisms,” consists of several boxes all
printed with messages we might leave to our-
selves frequently, such as “Call your mother’-’ or

R.L. Tillman:  

“Lose some weight.” The second piece, “Ditto,’.’
features one framed print, and then hundreds
of copies fanned out across the floor for view-
ers to take with them. '

The third piece, located at the front of
the gallery, is the exhibition’s namesake —
“While You Were Out.” For the piece, Tillman
printed up hundreds of copies of a standard

“While you were out” form. Vis_itors of the
exhibit can write messages on them and then
pin them individually to one of the boards on
the opposite wall.

“People can leave their notes, either for

[Tillman] or for friends or for whomever they

decide to leave a note for,” Katy Peace, co-.

executive director at Future Tenant, said. “So

it’s an exhibition that is constantly changing as

it progresses over the course of the mont .”
To a certain degree, “While You Were Out”

reﬂects a general trend in the art world. Be-
cause of the utilitarian‘ nature of crafts, the art
world often did not hold it on the same level as
ﬁne arts. But in the past few years, printmak-
ing, traditionally thought of as a “lower,” form
of art, has become increasingly popular.

“It’s counter-intuitive. In an increasingly
digital culture, you might expect interest in

printed art to contract. Instead, it’s growing,”
Tillman said.

' Printmaking is sometimes regarded as a
style of artfor the masses. Prints can be copied
and duplicated any number of times with cop-
ies remaining nearly identical to the original.
The same is true in a bigger way in the case of

. “While You Were Out,” except now the viewers

make the reprints. The original image, that of

‘the ‘‘While you were out” note fashioned by '

Tillman, remains the same, but each viewer
gets to add her personal input.

‘ “While You Were Out” demonstrates the-
potential for creativity and interaction, both
within the artcommunity and between the art-
ist and spectator. Now acollaboration between

the artist and the exhibit’s viewers, the project .

began as a collaboration between Tillman and
students at Artists Image Resource, a local
organization that helps artists and students
throughout the creative process by bringing
them together in what AIR director Robert
Beckman refers to as a “dynamic working en-
vironment.” Tillman, formerly the artist in
residence for Kent State University, came to
Pittsburgh through his work with AIR.

“The [Artists Image Resource] studio serves
as a broad—based print and imaging resource
whose mission is to integrate the creation of
ﬁne art printwork with innovative educational
programs that explore the creative process,”
Beckman said.

CONCERT REVIEW

Katy Perry rocks the Pete

Sarah Simkin
Senior Staff Writer

Decked out in sequins and brilliant colors,
Katy Perry’s admirers awaited their pop
star.

The Petersen Events Center glowed with
light—up cotton candy, sunglasses and what-
ever knickknacks vendors could cram LED
lights into. The “Candy Land” stage theme
oddly contrasted what could be seen of the
athletic arena’s usual decor.

, But Katy Perry’s show outdid any baubles
the audience toted —— perhaps too well.

At times, the concert’s remarkable
showmanship and stagecraft threatened
to overshadow the music entirely. The
technological feats of trapdoors and rising
pillars, backup dancers-turned-acrobats
on aerial wires and smoke and bubble ma-
chines tended to detract from rather than
enhance Perry’s performance.

Still, she overshadowed her opening. acts

‘ so that the audience’s lack of focus during

their performances seemed warranted.

Welsh performer Marina and the Dia-
monds was roundly ignored by the crowd
still ﬁling into the.Petersen Events Center,
with parts of her set of inarticulate warbling
drowned out almost entirely by chanters
demanding the main act.

Second opening performer DJ Skeet
Skeet fared a little better and got the audi-
ence members on their feet with his single
“Hello.”

But a DJ only holds so much interest.
The thousands of teenyboppers wanted
their idol. .

A video featuring Perry as a butcher’s as-
sistant with dreams of a gumdrop paradise
—— no, it didn’t make more sense for those
in the audience — projected onto overhead
screens preceding her entrance from un-
der the stage. She opened strong with the
adolescent anthem “Teenage Dream.” The
strange and rather weak storybook—narra-
tive video resumed at various points in the
show to entertain the crowd during several
of Perry’s many costume changes.

Perry is a less-than-gifted dancer, but
her conﬁdent stride, outlandish costumes
— such as a bra made of pinwheels — and
staggeringly high heels allowed no room for
doubt about who owned that bubblegum-
pink stage. Faced with a crowd initially
more preoccupied with capturing what was
happening up on stage on their cellphones
than actually watching, Perry’s guileless,
wide—eyed charisma and personable stage
banter won out.

In an early sign of the many odd gim-
micks to come, Perry introduced “Waking
Up in Vegas” with a brief skit featuring an
anthropomorphic slot machine. Through
different parts of the-show, showgirls, an
Asian Elvis impersonator and appropriately

Z costumed dancers for the less-than-subtle

innuendo of “Peacock” accompanied the
quirky pop star on stage.
Perry paused for a bit of fan interac-

tion — getting more than she bargained T

for when the male audience member she
invited to kiss her on the cheek swooped
in to kiss her neck. “My husband is back-
stage!” she shrieked and blushed endear-
ingly. She then moved on to “I Kissed a
Girl,” — her changed pace transforming the
song’s ﬁrst verse into a lounge—act ballad
before energizing it back into the breakout
hit’s original beat.

Costumed as a cat lady —— and no doubt
missing her own feline, Kitty Purry —, the
pop sensation belted out “E.T.” amid elabo-
rate choreography.

Perched on a candy—cane striped bar
stool, Perry slowed the showdown with an
acoustic set, telling her adoring crowd, “All
of you sit down and let me entertain you,
that’s what you came here for.”

Perry sharedla bit of off-target Pa. trivia,
apparently mistaking steel- and ketchup-
producing Pittsburgh for chocolate mecca
Hershey, which the crowd ate up regard-
less. Then she went into a cover of her
close friend Rihanna’s “Only Girl in the
World” before a well-received medley of
Wiz Khalifa’s “Black and Yellow,” Rebecca
Black’s “Friday” and Willow Smith’s “Whip
my Hair.”

Perry gushed about how much her fans’
support means to her. “There are almost
10,000 people here! You guys — I’ve only
put out two records, itfs crazy that you all
came out to see me!” the singer said. Ac-
cordingly, she dedicated “Thinking of You”
to everyone who believed in her. The gesture
escaped unbearable over—sentimentality
only because of how genuine she seemed
in her gratitude. In the evening’s greatest
coup de theatre, Perry then stepped aboard
a pink, cotton— candy cloud which rose into
the air to hover directly over the audience,
keeping very much in line with the “Glinda
the Good Witch” motif her stage presence
conjured to mind. . ‘

After donning her signature blue wig for
“Hot n Cold,” Perry invited audience mem-
bers on stage to join her while she covered
Whitney Houston’s “I Wanna Dance with
Somebody,” liberally dispensing hugs and
making a tiny, purple-wigged fan’s night
when she snapped a picture with her.

Wisely shedding the theatrics to let one
of her biggest hits shine on its own, Perry
performed “Firework” alone on an unlit
stage. The evening appeared to come to
an end when real pyrotechnics punctuated
the song and Perry disappearedthrough a
lowered platform in the stage.

But, of course, that couldn’t have been
the end, one of Perry’s songs was conspicu-
ously absent. The venue transformed into
a beach party with beach balls, water can-
ons and confetti galore to end the night on
Perry’s smash hit “California Gurls.” I

FILM REVIEW

‘Cars’ sequela lemon Q

Larissa Gula
Staﬁ” Writer

“Cars 2”

Starring: Owen Wilson, Larrythe Cable Guy,
Michael Caine

Director:john Lasseter and Brad Lewis
Studio: Disney/Pixa

Grade: C '

It’s asad day when a Pixar movie disappoints.

Disney/Pixar’s newest ﬁlm, “Cars 2,” cel-
ebrates Pixar’s 25th year of animation. Unfor-
tunately, it seems the studio forgot some things
about what it takes to make a good sequel.

“Cars 2” begins in the middle of the Pa— A

ciﬁc Ocean as spy car Finn McMissile (Michael
Caine) begins to gather information-on avague
—— but obviously dastardly — plot that ap-
pears to be organized by villainous Professor
Ziindapp (Thomas Kretschmann).

Cut to Radiator Springs, where Lightning
McQueen (Owen Wilson) still liveswith his
friends, including Mater the tow truck (Larry
the Cable Guy), during his offseason from rac-
ing. After another car,_ Francesco Bemoullii
baits him to travel to and race in the World
Grand Prix, McQueen begins to ‘ﬁght with
Mater, whose redneck habits embarrass him.
Then, followinga series of coincidences, Mater
is mistaken for a secret agent who’s supposed
to meet with McMissile.

' The entire ﬁlm becomes an action-packed
series of Mater-driven shenanigans ﬁlled with
explosions and jokes, meant to-convey a mes-
sage about being yourselfand cherishing your
friends. Too bad it doesn’t work.

Remember the ﬁrst ﬁlm, where McQueen
was forced to slow down in a small town? The
ﬁlm had a relaxed atmosphere, with developed

. and realistic characters who told a relatable

story. It wasn’t perfect — some critics com-
plained that the ﬁrst ﬁlm was too slow -— but
it was still enjoyable.

The sequel overcompensates— it’s too fast.
Character development and tension got torn
out because there’s no time for anything to

develop, and the story drags audiences along ’

without time to fully enjoy the jokes. And the

vehicles only.

Education

Plaques around the building explain the mea-
sures being taken to protect the environment,
and an educational tour offered to school groups
showcasesthe building’s many eco-friendly in-
novations.

Waste

The building utilizes a comprehensive recy-
cling system for cardboard, glass, alun1inum,-
plastic, paper, cookingoil-—— 30 percent ofwhich
is recycled as l)lOﬁ.lEl — and even shipping pal-
lets. Over 200 recycling bins inside and outside

action almost completely hides the message
the movie tries to deliver.

Worse, the fast-paced drive of this ﬁlm
completely undermines the point of the origi-
nal — slowing down. Pixar doesn’t take the
time to combine the best of both worlds to
create an interesting, ﬁln sequel with some
emotional depth. Instead, it makes “Cars 2”
pure action.

As an added blow, most of the old characters
(minus Mater) feel hollow during their 10_min-
utes of screen time. Mentor Doc Hudson, voiced
in the ﬁrst ﬁlm by Paul Newman, disappears

, completely after the actor’s death, and with

him goes one of the strongest characters. The
others, including McQueen, receive the same
kind of treatment,_with lazy voice acting and
poor characterization failing to add familiarity
to what already feels like a brand new world.

Both best and worst of all, the ﬁlm begins -

with a traditional short story clip about the
characters from “Toy Story” following the con-
clusion of the third ﬁlm. It coaxes a smile out
of fans while also delivering a punch in the gut,
as Pixar reminds audiences that it has made
sequels that surpassed their predecessors.

Perhaps one of the only saving graces in
this ﬁlm is Michael Caine’s voice-acting and
the new characters, which distract from the
various disasters going on elsewhere. In ad-
dition, the animation impresses and creates a
decent atmosphere by capturing the excitement
of traveling the “Cars 2” world, the elation of
ﬂying through the air and, occasionally, the
suspense from the nefarious plot that’s afoot
as bullets and explosions threaten Mater and
the spy cars..

Still, the animation cannot repair the dam-
age done to this established franchise. Frankly,
Pixar should have made this story into a ﬁlm
independent of “Cars.” As is, it completely ig-
nores the themes of the ﬁrst ﬁlm and accord-
ingly — aside from the familiar characters
— barely feels like an actual sequel.

While it has its moments, “Cars 2” turns so
far away from its predecessor that it’s almost

unrecognizable. In the end, it’s just an imma- V

ture ﬁlm which deviates from Pixar’s style of
appealing to both children and adults. Better
luck next summer, Pixar. I ' -

Sports Editor

When_ longtime Pitt basketball fan
Sammy Dilxgostino walked into the
Greentree.SportsPlex at 6 p.m. on
Monday, 200 people had already
crowded onto the bleachers in the

A Ex/en though the Pittsburgh Bas-

ketball Club Pro-Am Summer League
added two extra sets of bleachers be-
hind the basket since last week, the
only space left was standing room by
the time the ﬁrst game tipped off at
7 p.m. ’
. Diagostino plays a major rolein
coordinating and running the league
that allows local college athletes to
play together during the summer. He
said he noticedagrowthinthe1eague’s
popularity last year.

The league started sixyearago, but
beginning last summer, there was no-
where to stand by the time the games
tipped ‘off. ,

“Obviously, I’ve been fortunate —
I sit on the ﬂoor, but I notice people
don’t have great seats, butthey’re great
fans,” D’Agostino said. “They come’
early, stay late and they cheer.”

The ideafortl1e league startedwith
Pitt head coachjamie Dixon himself,
who mentioned to D’Agostino thatthe

- Pittsburgiiareaneededsomewherefor

the athletes to play while they went to
sun1rner school. _

' Unlike most big cities, Pitts-_
burgh didn’t have an organized sum-
mer league for college athletes. So
D’Agostino——who hasn’t missedaPitt
home game in 23 years — and other
fans took the idea and ran with it. ,

Now he can’t believe the crowds
that arrive at Greentree to watch
the games. This summ'er, the league
started onJune 20. The teamswillplay

There are three games per night or high school level. After Pitt lost to where those players are.

fromjuly 18 throughjuly 20. year, Brown sounded so upset on the are good players locally,” D’Agostino

The league features seven teams
with players from schools suchas Pitt,
Duquesne and Robert Morris as well
as some Division H players, athletes
who are graduates oflocal high schools
but attending other universities and
former players who are returning to
the area. '

This season, D’Agostino said there
are 68 Division I players from 11

schools as well as 15 former Divisionl -

players and two Division H athletes.
. A Basketball Town

D’Agostino grew up around bas-
ketball. He had ﬁve cousins who
played Division I, and since he’s from
Aliquippa, he said a love for the sport
is in his blood. A I ‘

_ He added that he was a- decent

' player, but the smallest in" a family

with male cousinsthatstood anywhere
from 6-foot-3 to 6-foot—5. D’Agostino
is not even 6 feet tall. In the past ﬁve
years, the only Pitt games he missed
watching in person were four road
games. ’

He transferred that love ofbasket— ,

ball into running the summer league
at Greentree.

“I like to hear the people cheer- _,
. ing and whenthey clap for the kids

after games,” he said. “It’s aﬁm thing.
It warms my heart that we’re doing
something for the kids and the com-
munity’! 0 V

On Monday, two Pitt fans --Joe
Brown and Bob Johnston —— made
their ﬁrst trip to the games, setting
up their folding chairs next to the
bleachers. A

By the time the ﬁnal game was
windingdown, Brown said theywould
“unquestionably” be back.

Brown called himselfan avid bas-

ketball fan, whether it’s at the college

phone thatjohnston thought he losta
family member.

“I said, ‘You don’t understand, it’s
devastating to me,”’ he said. “I love
basketball. I’ve been brought up on it
since I was a kid. Bob told me about
this league  and it’s been a joy. I said
my wife probably thinks I got lost.”

. Watching the games on Monday,

‘ Brown felt himselfgetting excited for

another Pitt season, but he also asked

a quest1'onthat’s on the mind of many

Panther fans as the season nears.
“It’s goingto be another 20 wins,”

‘he said. “But are they are going to

break my heart again?” .

Johnston said the two decided to
attend the surnmerleague games “for
the enjoyment ofwatchingbasketball.”
He said Pitt basketball is especially en_-
tertainingforhimbecausehisbrother
and sister-in-law both worked for the
University of Connecticut.

_ “There’s always abigrivalry game
between the Huskies and the Pan-
thers, and the bragging rights with
the family’s on the line,” he said. “They
always talk about the West Virginia-
Pitt rivalry, but in our house it’s the
Pitt—UConn rivalry.”

The area needed a summer league
that can attract so many high-caliber
athletes and local fans, Ditxgostino
said. J

Years back, Pittwasn’ta nationally-
recognized program, Duquesne wasn’t
playing _well and Robert Morris was
still anup-and-coming program.

“Therewas really nothing for kids
to look up at, other than high school

' football and the Steelers,” he said.

“Growingup, whenthey had to make a
choice, they usually picked football.” _

Dibigostino said that, 30 years
ago, around 10’ athletes ﬁ‘om Beaver
Countywould move onto p1ayDivision
Ibasketball. Nowwhen D’Agostino tells
Dixon that story, the Pittcoach asks

said. “Obviously, some people will
come in and poach a kid here and
there. But forthe most part, when
there are programs like there are now,
kids want to stay local.”

He added that with the excite-
ment thatcomes from Pitt’s success
— as well as Duquesne’s improve-
ment and Robert Morris’ recent trips

J _to the NCAA Tournament — there

is more excitement for basketball in
Pittsburgh.

“It’s a basketball town now,” he
said. ' '

Rurming the League

Because of N CAA rules, the league
can’t charge for anything— not admis-
sion, parking or programs. D’Agostino
said he would never risk the eligibility
of any student-athlete.

“We monitorvery closely and Com-
pliance is aware of everythingthat goes
on,” he said. “The worst nightmare
for me would be if someone was in-
eligible because they were playing in

' the league.”

The league needs sponsors to help
pay for expenses such as uniforms,
rentforthe gym, atrainer that always
has to be on site, officials and insur-
ance. Sponsors donate to the Pitts-
burgh Basketball Club that runs the
Pro-Am League. A

According to its website, the Pitts-
burgh Basketball Club is “a nonproﬁt
 organization that organizes, di-
rects and promotes youth basketball
throughout the tri-state area.”

“It’s certainly not a for—proﬁt
league, at all,” D’Agostino said. “If we
meet expenses, we feelveryfortunate.
Everyone that does this does it out of
love-——the scorekeepers, statkeepers,
the kids wiping the ﬂoor. Everybody
has pitched in because I think they
see whatagreat thing it’s been for the

fans and for e ds.”

D’Agostino said getting sponsors
is a balancing act.

“You don’t want to beg,” he said.
“We certainly don’t want to go in the
red. We .welcome any sponsor, any-

body who gives, every little bit helps '

defray the cost.”

The major sponsors —— UPMC, _

‘SPK Law, The Lair (Pantherlair.com),
PGT Trucking, Center Court, PBC and
SteelCityTickets.com — are also the
teams’ names. A . .
The most complicated aspect of
runningtheleague isﬁndingvolunteer
coaches. D’Agostino said the league
wants one coach per team for the en-
tire season, but added that that’s been
difﬁcult to achieve. if
“That’s the one thing that kind of
saddens me in a way, because you’re
coaching great kids, potential pros,
guys you’re going to see on TV every
night — but even the basketball guys
in the area don’t want to donate their

' time,” he said. “Anybody thatwants to

coach, we’re happy to have them.”

While the people who run the
league tell the volunteers to coach to
win, all the players also have to get
minutes on the ﬂoor, which helps the?’
developmental aspect of the league.

“As the league goes on, the team-
work gets better; the games get better,
the kids get to know each other and
they cheer for each other,” he said.
“They’re good kids.”

Pitt junior Dante Taylor said the
league is especially beneﬁcial for in-
coming freshmen, who build chem-
istry with their college teammates by
playingwith and againstthern. — V

The new players also geta glimpse
of the college game and every player ,,

' gets thechance to prepare for the up-

coming season.

“Itlets me getreadyforthe season,
stay in shape and keep playing,” he
said. “It’s beneﬁcial for everybody to
come in and play college-caliber ——
Division I—caliber —— teams.”[

Panthernewcomers—mainlyincom-
ingfreshmanjohnjohnson.

But itwasn’t afreshman that stole .

the show on Monday night.
As senior Ashton Gibbs froze
his defender at the top of the key

and pulled up for one his ﬁve made’

3—pointers, he drew chuckles of ap-
preciation, and a few headshakes of
amazement, fromthe standing—room-
only crowd.

Gibbs and SPK Law teammate

put on animpressive performance on
Monday as they led their team to an
83-75 victory over UPMC.

But last Wednesday—with Gibbs .

attending a skills camp in Chicago —
SPK wasn’t so lucky. The team fell to
UPMC 74-65. ‘

Panthers dominate games

Pro’-Am < 11 ,
' Pitt junior Dante Taylor-might have arrived
a few minutes after ﬁpoff on Monday night, but
that didn’t stop him from leading The Lair to
awin. '

He was dominant inside all night, ﬁnishing
with 21 points and 10 rebounds.

He scored15 points inthe secondhalf, includ-
ing a jumper from the foul line that showed his
range and gave his team a 59-53 advantage.

“I felt good. I ijustwantedtotryand be produc-
tive since I was ate,” Taylorsaid.

After the game, Taylor said his goal for the
league is to focus on being aggressive, scoring
more and rebounding. ~

Those objectives showed late in the second
halfas Taylor collectedalong rebound, passed off
to a teammate and then took the reuirn bounce
pass and scored inthe post. _

With about 12 minutes remaining in the sec-
ond half, the Lair went on a 6-0 run to put the
game out of reach. ’ .

WithoutGibbs, SPKLawrelied onYoungstown
State’s Dushawn Brooks for a team-leading 24
points. i I .

Coming off his 26-point inaugural sum-

mer league game, Pitt incoming freshman

‘ another solid performance.

In the second game on Wednesday night,

' Johnson scored 15 points, but it was classmate
, Durandjohnson who sealed the victor_y for 

team late in the game.

Durandjohnson went4 for 4 from the ﬁre-
throw line intheﬁnal secondsto seal thevictory
for UPMC. He ﬁnished with seven points, all
from the foul line. b ‘

Sophomore _].J. Moore was one of the most
active players on the ﬂoor. His action atthe hoop
included a drive and a ﬂoater inlthe lane to pull
Center Court within one, 61-60, late in the sec-
ondhalf. '

But even with his ability to get to the basket,
Moore struggled to put the ball in the hoop. He
ﬁnished with 26 points, but on 8—of-21 shooting
from the ﬁeld. -

_ Khem Birch led Center Court with 11 re-
bounds and looked more than comfortable
defensively. ‘ '_ I

Birch said since he started playingbasketball,
performing on the defensive end has come natu-
rally to him; He hopes to bring those abilities to
the Pittteamthis season. ‘

“Iwanttobring energy, rebounding, defense,”
he said. “Hopefully offense as well.” '

PBC 62, PGT 52

A Big East conference rival put on the best
- performance in the ﬁnal game of the night.

West Virginia’s Darryl Bryant led PBC to the
win with 12 points, six assists and six rebounds
in his ﬁrst appearance at the Pro—Am League
this summer.

Pitt sophomore Cameron Wright started

strong, scoring eight of PGT’s ﬁrst nine points, '

but he ﬁnished with 11 overall and couldn’t push
histeam to the .

Although incoming freshman Malcolm Gil-
bert didn’t perform well offensively, he looked
solid onceagainonthe defensive end andﬁnished
with three blocks.

“The pace is deﬁnitely quicker than high
schoo ,” Gilbertsaid before Monday’s game. “So
it’s just adjusting and getting used to it. I’m glad
I showed up. [for the league] and I had a good
[ﬁrst game] .”

PBC opened up a big lead early on and led
39-24 atthe half.Anearly second—halfrun helped
PGT trim the lead to 52-50, but PBC closed the
game on a run of its own to produce the ﬁnal
score. ' g l ,

On Monday, the second game of the evening
featured SteelCityTickets.com and PBC -— two
teams without a Pitt player on their rosters.

But Gibbs and Patterson made up for their
Pitt teammates’ bye night with their strong per-
formances in the ﬁrst game.

SPK Law 83, UPMC 75

Gibbs ﬁnishedwithagame-high31 points and
dished out six assists to lead SPK Law to the win

_ in the ﬁrst game on Monday night.

He shot 10 for 15 from the ﬁeld, including
5—of-9 from the 3-point line, and had several
spectators commenting on his “classic Gibbs
performance.”

The senior guard made scoring look easy
all night. On afew possessions,=he was the only
member ofhis teamto touchtheballashewould
dribble at the top of the key, make a quick move
to get his defender to back off and then drain a
3-pointer.

He passed off to his teammates plenty, too.

In the second half, Patterson scooped up aloose
ball and passed to Gibbs in transition. At the
other end, Gibbs found Patterson withabounce
pass and the redshirt sophomore converted the

‘ lay up.

Pattersonwas second on theteam inscoring,
ﬁnishing with 20 points and seven rebounds.

Durandjohnson played his best game of the
Pro—Am league for UPMC. He was active on the
ﬂoorand ﬁnished with 18 points that came from
a combination of jump shots and driving to the
hoop. -

PGT 86, The Lair76

In a performance-that Pitt fans are_ familiar
with, Nasir Robinson was all over the court in
the ﬁnal game on Monday night, leading PGT
with 18 points on 8-of—13 shooting.

‘Robinson consistently got his hands on the
ball inside and made some impressive ﬁnishes
in trafﬁc around the basket. He ﬁnished with
six rebounds. ‘

The only areawhere Robinson struggled was
the foul line —— he went 2 for 7.

man Isaiah Epps — didn’t haveatrue point guard

I THE WISDOM o1= SAUL‘

Kahn continues to make questionable decisions

Isaac Saul
Assistant Sports Editor

The Minnesota Timberwolves’ David Kahn
could be the most idiotic general manager in
all of sports, rivaling only the Washington Red-
skins’ Daniel Snyder.

So why quit when you’re behind? What else
could Kahn possibly do to embarrass himself?
Well, a good way to start would be by chasing
around Duke coaching legend Mike Krzyzewski,
which Kahn did earlier this week.

Accordingto the New York Daily News, Kahn
wanted to lure Coach.K from the warm sun
of North Carolinaall the way to Minnesota to
coach guard. Ricky Rubio.

I’m going to repeat that. David Kahn, the
Minnesota Timberwolves general manager,
thought he could lure Duke coach Mike Krzyze—
wski to Minnesota with the unproven Rubio.

This is the same Coach Kwho had no hesita-
tion in turning down a chance to coach Lakers
guard Kobe Bryant — during Bryant’s prime.

This is the same Timberwolves team that
has no true center, no proven point guard and

no dominant shooting guard.

It does have Kevin Love though, who is about
as dorninantas it gets. But Kahn, beingthe bril-
liant GM he is, chose Derrick Williams — a
forward who plays the same role as Love — with

the No. 2 overall pick in the draft last week.
It wasn’t the ﬁrst time Kahn performed a
head-scratcher at the NBA draft.

After drafting the highly-touted Spanish
sensation Ricky Rubio in 2009, the Tirnber—
wolves GM headed down aturbulent path while
trying to bring the guard overseas.

After weeks of bad -press and public ne-
gotiations, Kahn couldn’t get Rubio to sign a
buyout offer and instead spent the last two years
watching his franchise player produce mediocre
numbers in European basketball leagues — a
stage that produces competition light—years

V behind that of the NBA.

Now, with his coveted guard ﬁnally on the

way to Minnesota, Kahn couldn’t help himself

but to re-up his standing in the idiot department
over the last two weeks. V g
It started at the 2011 NBA draft -— which was

full of surprising controversy, contract-buyout’

issues and Danny Almonte—type age fabrication.
But for the second time in three years, Kahnwas
the center of attention.

While Kahn has spent the lastfew days hunt-
ing down unreasonable coaching prospects,
his move that made the headlines involved the
Timberwolves 57th pick in the draft, Tanguy
Ngombo. ' l _

Ngombo, who had played most ofhis basket-
ball in Qatar, blew up as an Internet sensation,

with people hyping him as a “21-year—old star.”
All of his numbers supported the hype, except
one — his age.

‘ That’s because after the NBA draft, it sur-
faced that Ngombo was actually 26, not 21. A

V little bit of homework on the 6-foot~4- small

forward would have revealed that prior to his
draft selection. _ ' -

While the glaring repercussion of this news
is that Ngombo’s careerwill likely end ﬁve years

l' earlierthanpreviously expected, therewas this

catch: Accordingto NBA draft law, an intema—
tional player must be 22 years of age oryounger
in order to be drafted; otherwise, he must ente
the market as a free agent. v . -

I That law and news of Ngombo’s age discrep-
ancyhas prompted NBA officials to void the pick
— apick which Minnesotabought the rights to,
taking both Ngombo and a fat wad of cash off
the table for the Timberwolves franchise.

' Ngombo’s status in the league will be re-
viewed by NBA ofﬁcials this week, but analysts
do not sounds optimistic that the Timberwolves
will get to keep the African star on board.

In the wake of the Ngombo pick; Kahn put
into motion a draft-day trade that sent guard

Johrmy Flynnto the Houston Rockets in ex— .

change for the 23rd pick in the draft and Brad
Miller. After Flynn failed aphysical, the Rockets
pumped the brakes on the deal.

In typical Kahnfashion, the deal heldamajor.

link between a train of swaps going on involv-
ing Chicago, Miami and Newjersey. Because of
Flynn’s health issues, all of those league ofﬁces
were held up.

Furthermore,  was the same guard
who Kahn took before Stephen Curry,'Brandonﬂ
Jennings andjrue Holiday — all of whom have
produced much more in the NBA than Flynn. In
that same draft, Kahn also picked Ty Lawson,
another guard who has been better than Flynn,
but traded him to the Denver Nuggets.

So there Kahn sat, with a 26-year-old for-
ward that he paid for and probably won’t see
play, a one—time Spanish phenomenon whose
career might have already passed him by and a
log—jammed draft-day trade involving one of the
most disappointing picks in his NBA career.

I guess after all that, the only reasonable
thing for him to do_was to go after Coach K‘
I just hope it was more of a “desperate times
call for desperate measures” type move, as op-
posed to a “I might actually make this happen”
type move.

The reality is that Coach K would no sooner
leave Durham for Minnesota than Cristiano

Ronaldo would leave Real Madrid for the Port— ’

land Timbers of the MLS.

‘Speaking of soccer, well, I’ll be relieved if
Kahn makes it through next year’s NBA draft
without trying to pick Lionel Messi. I
