Two members of Pittsburgh City Council recently
complained that _the University Book Center, although
tax-exempt, sells obscene literature.

University officials responded that the Book Center
enjoys no tax-free status and never has. Further, the
freedom to reject or ‘accept ideas within the law must
not be restricted.

Lawrence J. Monnett, assistant chancellor for busi-
ness affairs, wrote Councilman J. Craig Kuhn that the
book center is indeed a commercial venture, supply-
ing the community as well as the University with a
wide selection of a variety of literature.

In response to the “obscene books” charge of
Councilman Patrick Fagan, Dr. Alan Rankin, assistant
chancellor for stude%ffairs, called the University “a
citadel of freedom” for considering new ideas. He

[said that the Book Center has not violated any Penn-
sylvania law in selling its books. "

The package’ of books in question included these
titles: What Women Want to Know, Streetwalker, and
Poetica Erotic/a. What the councilmen did not point
out was that these books are on sale also at Gimbels,

Kaufmann’s and Horne’s in downtown Pittsburgh.
Theenew general manager of the University Book

I Center, John Belanya, has refused to comment about

this. At a Student Government meeting last Thurs-
day, he explained that he was hired to run the book
stores; the public relations men were hired to make
the statements. ' ,

Belanya also explained at the meeting that the
book centers under his administration will be con-
cerned with the welfare of the students.

In other SG action at the ,meeting_:

.. The new chairman for the SG-Student Union co-
sponsored ‘ Winter Weekend, Michael Marcuse, an-
_nounced plans" to have a ten—member ccordinating
committee. . ' '

‘ Plans for the Feb. 13 weekend include a carnival
with booths sponsored by various organizations for
Fridaynight. If the committee is unable to arrange
for_a Saturday outing at some lodge, then skating,
folk-singing, and “homey-type” events will be spon-
sored on campus, climaxed with a sweetheart dance.

‘The following chairmen for the Committee on
Parking Appeals, which willibe present to represent
any student who is appealing the towing away of his

car by campus police, were appointed: Charles
Gularson, Bruce Cool, and Jack Koury.
Other committee chairmen named are: Beverly

Reifman and Murray Brown, Pitt Preview; Melanie
Fasso, social; Janet Wolbert, Gularson and Miss Reil-
man, student affairs; James Kleinberg, discrimination,
and Dan Duﬁy and Ailene Harper, coordinating.

SG also voted to request the extension of library
hours to begin next Wednesday and last for three
weeks. The library will be open till 11 p.m. on week-
days and Sundays, and till 6 p.m. on Saturdays and 10
p.m. on Fridays, if plans go through.

“It’S been fun -fora while, but

0 Headlines Cast of Top Entertainers

, Tony Martin, a versatile star in the entertainment world,-

headlines a cast of performers featured at the Holiday House
Nov. 1 as part ofthe Homecoming Weekend festivities. Per-

sical comedy, radio, tlevision, re-
cording and innumerable supper

club billings. ‘
. _ /‘

‘ Testimonial of his stature in the
entertainment industry is, the fact
that his name appears’ four times
in the ‘-‘Walk of Fame,” Holly-
wood’s star studded sidewalk cov-
ering a dozen blocks. He has

- been cited for "his efforts in radio,

movies, television and recordings.

Chancellor Addresses  
Press; Stops Coaching

that it was fortunate that the
Panthers were 3-0 so far this
season, but that a winning-re-
cord was not imperative for
coach Michelosen to return:

The Chancellor said. “I think a
good bit of the success of this
year’s team is ‘due to their inner
resourcefulness. You can almost
hear an inner spirit coming from
the players. Also, they are getting
better leadership from one captain
than from a team of captains.”~.

John’s been a wonderful
soldier about the‘ whole thing,-”
the chancellor said, “He’s react-
ed Very nicely to what we ask-
ed him to do.”

After a good start this season,
the Chancellor has seen fit to turn
the reins over to Michelosen and
the team. “All the credit for the‘
team’s success ‘belongs to John

and the p1ayers,’f- ‘said _I..it_chﬁeld. _

lformances are slated for '8‘ and 11: p.m. _ 

The Dot recording artist has been lauded as a performer. . l
in nearly every medium of show business." His professional '
proﬁle reads: movies, _theater,—. mu-9m " i ‘ '

to many of his collegues, Martin
has remained in the limelight for
over 25 years. Among singers, he
has been tabbed as “the last'ot
the note-holders.’’ ‘

P Martin boasts one of the big- 

gest collections of gold’ records
in the business, He has ‘record-
ed such hits as “I Get Ideas,’’.
“To Each His Own,” “There's

No Tomorrow” and “Begin the I

Beguille.” And he is including
these in his vocal agenda for
Homecoming Weekend,

' As a .motion picture star, he

‘has appeared in more than 20'-

ﬁlms, receiving plaudits for per-
formance in ‘Here Come the
Girls,” “Hit the Deck,” “Til the

Clouds R011'By” and “Show Boat,"

to mention a few.
, Gracie’s Boyfriend _
Radio audiences remember him

as Gracie’s boyfriend on the Burns

and Allen, Show. ‘

But it is a ‘nightclub per-
former that Martin has gained
an international reputation. The
impeccably groomed and deb-
onair entertiner is a "holder of
many attendance, records at

nightclubs spanning the United. _

States and Europe. Martin feels
nightclub work is the most ex-
citing, personal kind of enter-
tainment. ’

in The Spotlight .

With Stan Schweiget

 

‘sor C. Northcote Parkinson,

 

When Franklin Delano Roosevelt said “We have nothing to fear, but fear itself.”, I’m

1 quite sure that the"‘we” he referred to was not the nation’s theatrical audiences! That state-.

ment from -1933 and the President’s Inaugural Address, was made at a time of social, politi-
cal, and economic turmoil in our country’s‘ history. Today,_ 30 years later, I am -willing to
apply Mr. Roosevelt’s remark to the present condition of theatre audiences in most of the

Si _ large American cities. I particularly refer to cities Such as Pittsburgh, Chicago and Detroit,

and those burgs along the tryout route to Broadway,

' namely, Boston, Philly, New Haven, and Washington,

/.

All of these tryout cities or road company towns seem
to have thesame thing in common: a general fear on the
part of the audience to think, to learn, and to ‘use their
skull in a productive capacity, Our audiences don’t want
to be bothered with world problems or national issues,
or any subject that might prove to be too provocative,

. contro'versial or mentally stimulating.

“We are confronted with enough reality around-
us all the time. Why should we, have to sit through
two hours more of stark, harsh, and shocking _real-
ism?” This, in essence, seems to be the general
trend of thought of today’s audiences.

They want to be entertained; they want to laugh;
they want to hold their ‘sides, and to be transported to a

D.C.

_world where the likes of a Birmingham, a Berlin, at Cuba,-
_— and a Khrushchev do not exist. The theatre, in these

people’s minds, is the medium that should transport us
into a world of unreality, away from life and its tribula-
‘tions. No room for knowledge or thought here. Facts will
-bear me out so please follow the ensuing data.

19 ROAD snows '

According to last week’s Variety, the Bible of show‘

business, there were 19 road shows in" 14 different cities.
Included in thsi total are 11 musical comedies, 4 straight
comedies, and 4 dramas. Of the 4 dramatic offerings, one,
“Bicycle Ride to Nevada,” reached Broadway and closed
after just one performance._That' left just three plays, ‘-‘A

. Man For All Seasons,” “Luther,” and “Who’s» Afraid of
Virginia Woolf,” and now that “Luther” has taken Broad- ~

way by storm, the number of serious plays has dwindled

to two. Riding the crest of popularity in big cities today, '

the musicalis the main solution to the tired businessman,
the over worked housefrau, and the Ladies Auxiliary.
Mary- Martin, Alfred Drake, Richard Rodgers, * “Fair
Lady,” “How to' Succeed ...,” and “Camelot” are the

magic carpets by which our audiences are being trans- 

ported to the world of the “Good Life.”~ No cares, no

problems, no strings.
SICKENED AT DIVERSION

But I am sickened at the amount and bulk of this

it form" of theatrical diversion being presented to the pub-

lic. The abundance of shows is astounding and it is a
known fact that a ratio of musicals to dramas -that have

had road show engagements in the past ten years would-

be lmost 12-1 in favor of the lighter divertissment. Aud-
iences seem'to have an uncanny capacity tioconsume

"these sparkling, tuneful, mirth-provoking delights, and

promoters keep shoveling more and more of it into the
audiences’ stomaches. ’ -

Parkinson Capt ivates

Audience With His Wifii

By NANCY DELANEY

A job expands to ﬁt the time
available for it, reiterated Profes-
at
Midday Series last Wednesday at
noon.-

So do some speeches. But, this
need not embarrass Professor
Parkinson.

Although Parkinson, like most

minute overcoat he 'was offered
by the Midday,Committee with a
muscular physique. of nothing but
sturdy,_ well—toned ideas, he cer-
tainly did not» need to pad ‘the
shoulders with cotton in order to
expand the speech to ﬁll the over-
coat. .
Not Overexpanded
Neither did heﬁstrain the but-
tons (and the audience) by let-
ting it voverexpand, as many
speakers do, and bulge flabbily
out of the ﬁfty minutes available.
His speech was inflated just
enough to inject lightness and
interest. When the professor in-
terjected comments like “all
libraries are always “outgrown,”
and. “‘I received a lot of fan
mail — abusive letters.‘ that is”
he merely ﬁlled up the corners.
It just didn't seem like padding

speakers, did not pack the ﬁfty- “

when viewed in the general"
context of his witty observa-
tions about administrators and
administrations.

The audience reaction to his
humor seemed a little extreme -_.
unless, of course, everyone there
had had experience working on a
committee, in which case his deﬁ-
nition of committology as the
study of committees “considered
not as a structure, but as an
organic growth,T’ could quite ap-.
propriately invoke guffaws.

Liquidate Critics

_In the Soviet Union, they liqui-
date critics, he explained, but
here we ask them to join the com-
mittee just to get them shut up.

' Besides the fact that admini-
strators usually spend their en-
tire work-day “making work
for each other,” they also spend
theirevenings at cocktail parties
deciding who among" them is
dynamic, be’ indicated.‘

Students, however, don’t need
cocktail parties to determine such
questions. They need only to at-
tend a Midday Series lecture to
ﬁnd out whois dynamic -—_‘ Pro-
fessor C. Northcote Parkinson, of
course.

MISS AFFLERBACH’S GOLDEN. JUBILEE: HEURRAHA!

*****1Ir*******-‘k*********k*********‘kir‘k‘k***k**‘k****

‘ IOU have heard us mention Miss Revera Aﬂlerbach who has been Forelady here at Eagle Shirts since 1918.
It is not often that one sees such allegiance, and we appreciate it. Also, she has been very nice to allow us

to bandy‘ her name about in ads, books, etc. So we would like to proclaim something to honor her and also give’

us another excuse to bandy her name: The Afﬂerbach Golden Jubilee Year. * Now, ordinarily this wouldn't
occur until 1968, but why wait until the last moment? Besides, we have already struck a medal (see above). The
cloth in the shirt upon which the medal is hanging is also namedpafter,‘ her: Aﬂlerbach Cloth. It is made in
Switzerland to her speciﬁcations, which are 20% wool and 80% cotton. Her reasoning isinterlesting. ,She wanted
enough wool‘ to make it very soft, but enough cotton to make it light and washable. Any more wool than
that and it’s not a shirt ‘so much as a nice, if bulky, garment for woodchopping or other hearty activities.
* Additionally, it is mothproof; if for no other reason than that no moth would be willing to go to all that
work for such scant nourishment. Aﬂlerbach Cloth is the moth equivalent of pomegranates. The Aﬂlerbachlubileo
Shirt comes, complete with medal as shown-, in solid colors (ﬂame red, midnight navy, loden green, winter white,
smoke blue) at about $13.00; and tartans, district checks and blazer stripes at about $14.00, wherever Eagle Shirts
are sold. If you’re not sure where that is in‘ your town, write Miss Aﬁlerbach, Eagle Shirtmakers, Quakertown, Pa.

It might be nice if you said congratulations. “ © 1963 EAGLE SHIRTMAKERS.QUAKERTOWN.PENNSYLVANIA

 Monda_y,, Oct,ob:er . 21-,i  , p A

Last week, the University Book Center joined the ranks of the
publishers and distributors of such books as Lady Chatterly’s Lover and
‘Tropic of -‘Cancer "when the Pittsburgh City Council decided to investigate
¥?the’literary wares on sale at the Fifth Avenue store.

A’ At last Tuesday’s meeting of the Council, Councilman J. Craig Kuhn

A to _ the amazed Council.

»could these possibly lead to?” asked Kuhn of the council. -

jversity is dealing in obscene literature, and whether such a corrupt orga-
nization as the Center should be permitted ’to‘ retain a tax-exempt status
which is does not possess.

'- Council President Patrick C. Fagan added that he intends to report
- _Decent Literature.” ,. h '- _
‘ The primary point to be considered is of course whether the books

/

_produced _a mailing list of the Center’s stock and began reading titles oﬁ

Included in the titles were such items as: Streetwallcer, A History of V
Orgies, Poetica Erotica, and How to Photograph Women. “To what degree

_. The Council apparently couldn’t answer his question, so it is now_
-staging a two-pronged investigation of the Center to discover if the ‘Uni- _ V

'- the incident to the “Holy Name Society and its National Organization for

 Editorial: Sex In   The Baal! Store

mentioned are really obscene (Councilman Kuhn produced no copies of
the books, merely their titles), but from what wehave ‘seen of the books,
there is very, little in them of interest to obscenity Sniffers.

For example, A Pictorial History of Burlesque is not a collection
of photos of strip teasers fanning themselves with ostrich feathers. Al-
though a few “strippers” are pictured, the majority of the book deals with
burlesque as Councilman Kuhn apparently never knew it, i.e., legitimate
acting and vaudeville. 7 ‘

For thatmatter, if one were to go by titles alone, then a recording
of St. Matthew’s Passion (also included in the ‘Center stock) mightbe in-
terpreted as an album depicting the erotic experiences of the famous saint.

, The whole affair is just that ridiculous. This sort of thing pops up
every time some do-gooder with a paid up annuity’ in paradise takes it
upon himself to cleanse the world of all its evils. _ -

That the books areof great interest to the socioligist, artist, photo-
grapher, and historians for their literary worth has never occurred to-
Councilman Kuhn. He is concerned with dirty pictures and filthy words,
and we are afraid that he is going to be sorely disappointed when the in-
vestigation gives the Book Center and its books a, “clean” billing. 4

Cause‘ and Effect Mix-up . . .

   
  

|’r|| ti|C f’ 
‘ A . By Irv Garfinkel
. , Every oncelin a while some one decides to criticize some aspect of the welfare
V ‘state. A little while ago an article appeared in The Pitt News asserting that the institution

A.--of relief encourages people to be lazy and sponge off of taxpayer’s money.
' ' I am not concerned with the factual errors contained in that article. These, errors

LlTT. MAN ON CAMPUS

.//o

   

 

were pointed out in Letters to the Editor. Rather, I am concerned with
the erroneous assumptions which‘ underly most criticisms of the welfare
state. - A .. .
Implicit in this moral criticism of relief and reliefers is the
notion that any individual if heonly wants to can get a job. This bazarre
notion is, obviously false. Unfortunately our economy has not been able
to gererate enough jobs for everyone capable of working. We have
had from 51/2% to 6% unemployed since before President Kennedy as-—
sumed_ office. Kennedy has said numerous fimesqthat he would like to

I reduce the unemployment_rate to 4%.

 

Solve the unemployment problem.

_ And if people can’t get work should we let them starve? No, we are no longer that
 barbaric. _We now believe that it’s wrong to let people starve in the midst of plenty. And
 probably more important, we know_that hungry men make revolutions. Thus we have rec-
"P _'ognized that the government is responsible for the welfare of it’s citizens. And if the gov- 9
 ernment is unwilling or unable to insure full employment it is ;respons'ible_or those who are‘,

 left out. - ' ' — . _.
' Let us suppose that some ‘people on relief are lazy, that

' some are chiselers —’ that is they have other jobs — and A

that some could get other jobs if they tried. The cost of

weeding out those few who do not really need relief from
those who do would be prohibitive.

_ Another criticism of the relief program is directed at

__ aid to dependent children. This part of the program sup-

 ‘posedly induces unwed mothers to have babies in order to

weasel more money out of the state.'We have here a question

of motivation. One way to settle the issue would be_to ask

these women why they continue having babies. Unfortun-

ately I,haven’t asked any unwed "mothers lately why. they

I  prove the above supposition. Nevertheless I doubt if the
promiseof more money from the state is the most important
factor in accounting for this continued multiplication. Even

though. I am not an expert on Freud, _it seems to me that the
sex drive could just possibly be a more important factor.

A ‘control and publicize it’s existence, we might go a long way
towards solving the problem.

‘ Do-Nothing Gripers. vs. . .r .—"

  LACabine’r

 

Griping is fun. It is also popular.’ Notice the
number of students at the University thatlgripe
all the time. If you add to this number the.num-
ber of students that gripe "part of the time, your
answer will approximately
equal the entire‘ student body
and a lot of the faculty. »

But when itcomes down to
people actually doing some
thing constructive about their
complaints ‘—,well, we’re -way
down to "a pathetically low
number. Unfortunately, most
people don’t seem to be inter-
ested enough in their school to
"try to help improve it- Or else
they don’t know quite how to
go about doing something. _ ._

Now we have_ a mechanism at our disposal
through which any complaints of an academic
nature can be treated quickly, easily and efficient-
ly. This mechanism is the Liberal Arts Cabinet.

The purpose of the Cabinet is to help make the
University a better school, from the point of view
of the students as well as from that of "the admin-
istration. Naturally, they cannot improve the
University from the student’s point of view if
they don’t know the student’s point of view.

One bit of information that the-. Cabinet was
able to squeeze hut of the tight-lipped student

By Marcia Bernstein

Unfortunately, most of the distribution courses .

are wonderful to sleep through. And now is the
time for us to do something to change this sad
situation. Unless, of course, you want to have to
take 45 hoursof sleep ati$33 (plus) an hour. In

that case, I suggest you don’t tell your parents

about  ‘ \ .

- It seems to me, from the number of people that
sit around‘ and complain to eachother about dis-
tribution courses, that a lot of time and money is
being (wasted. Our’s, the University’s and the

professors.

A come-on for some of these courses may be a
top man in the ﬁeld. Unfortunately, sometimes
he is so high on top that he ﬁnds it hard ’to come
down to the level of the students who know
virtually nothing about his subject.

Many complain that 80’s_ and 180’s courses
often don’t have any focal point, that they are just
surveys of an entire ﬁeld. Surveys
that skim over the top of the subject No Focal
matter giving the student no real Point-
understanding of any phase of the
subject or of the subject as a whole.

And some say that they haveterrible teachers
that don’t know .what they’re talking [about and
some say that the course is disorganized and some
say that the professor doesn’t care and they say
that something ought to be done. ,

And I. agree that something ought to be done.

If any ‘of us have valid complaints, we must
take the initiative. Use your head, if enough
people complain about one thing there’s a good

One of the greatest difficulties
encountered. in‘ the program, he
feels, is the proportion of Amer-

“We want more American men in
the program,” Han Nyo explained.

students are men, and 90 per cent,
of the 90 American students parti-

, MORGANTOWN — West Vi_rginia football
1- coach Gene Corum was a dejected man as he
"i talked to reporters in‘ the dressing room after
-e his team’s 13-10 loss to the Panthers Saturday. 
'- ' Corum had lost before. Now in his fourth
year at West Virginia, he has posted a 14-19-2
1.1 , record including Saturday’s loss. It is doubtful,

V  ’ though, if any of the 19
losses was harder to take
than the most recent one.

A glance at the statistics
shows that the _Mountain- ’
eers not onlylost the most
important statistic — points
— ‘but they also lost the
other indicitive statistics,
first downs and total of-
fense. But statistics fre-
quently lie. . -

p This is one game in
B0B SMIZIK -which they did because

From the time Pitt scored its ﬁrst touch-
down in the opening quarter until they began
their drive in the last period West Virginia ran
58. plays to only 31 for John Michelosen’s time,

‘ During this time West-Virginia piled up 11 ﬁrst
downs to only ﬁve for the Panthers. ,

All of which proves three things. (1) West
Virginia was the toughest foe the Panthers have
faced this season. (2) Pitt_ ‘played its worst
gameVof the season, a fact which was abetted
by reason one. (3) The Panthers had it when
they needed it. V V t V

There were varying degree of how good,
VVest Virginia was. Captain Al Grigaliunas
said, “Theyedid a real good job considering
allthe sophomore they had.”
V Corum said, “We were really up for the '
game. It was our best showing of the year.”
, It was up to the game’s hero, Paul Martha,
to play the Mounties their "strongest tribute. “I
c_ouldn’t believe they were so tough,” he said.
V for,4l minutes ‘of the 60 minute game West “They got great play from theireyoung kids.”
,Virginia played the Panthers all over the Martha and Michelosen both found ﬂaws in
ﬁeld. the Panther’s play. . , '

According to Martha, ‘.‘The_layoff really hurt
us. We didn’t look like the team we were in the
ﬁrst three games.”

Michelosen felt that “our tackling wasn’t

as sharp as it had been. This and the penal- V

ties helped West Virginia.” /1_',_

_Martha didn’t have to say Pitt had it- when
it needed it. He showed it was his 48-yard
touchdown run that. won the ‘game after the
Panthers looked dead.

Michelosen said, “It was a helluva comeback

for the kids. You’ve_got to give them credit for
not losing their heads.” _ ’

. The comeback especially pleased Don
Klosterman,'a scout for the American Foot- —" ‘
ball League’s.Kansas City Chiefs. “I’ve seen
Texas and Wisconsin: play,” Klosterman

. said, “and believeme Pitt’s in a class with
them. This comeback today showed" that
they’re a championship team.” . ‘
Klosterman’s opinion will be held by many
others if the Panthers comeback from Anna-
polis with a win next Saturday.

The corn was so thick you could

 butter it, but the PM series repast .

rof_ lVIac Martin and the Dixie
Travellers seemed to spit the ap-
petites'of the relaxed Thursday
night listeners. ’ ,

; The Travellers’ “sound” fea-
tured Billy Bryant on the five-

" string banjo, which, according to
 guitar-playing Martin, character-
‘ ;_ izes the difference between “blue-
_ V 1 grass and other folk music.” Mar-
” ._. tin went on to explain that “blue-

grass is a way "of presenting
Mountain folk music, using only
' non-electric string instruments.”
The guitar and banjo combina-
tion were rounded out by Mike
Carson who played a very good
“Arkansas ﬁddle,” and by Bass
player “Slim” Jones who doubled
, on the Guitar and The Nasal
-Twang. '
it Gusto of Demosthenes
-Martin, who announced the eve-

‘Lf’f‘.'i 'ning’s_ program ‘with the gusto of

Demosthenes practicing for his

 maiden speech, told the'audience

thatthe group is soon coming out

A _ with a long playing album en-

titled “Mac Martin and the Dixie

 ’Trave1lers Sing Folk and Blue-

grass Favorites.” .

, The Dixie Travellers started -
g ’ the

evening’s entertainment
. with “Bugle Call Rag.” While
this number did lack a bugle,

substitution using his banjo for
the bugle calls. “Salty Dog
Blues” highlighted Carson's ‘use
of open “barnhouse"' fourths on
the ﬁddle. . 1

“Lover's Return” represented a
change of pace as the group did-
this slow number in three-quarter
“hillbilly” time. “Foggy Mountain

Breakdown,” which f e a t u r e d
Bryant's banjo, a n (1 “Orange
Blossom Special,” which high-

lighted Carson's ﬁddle, received

the best audience reaction in the’

first half of the program.
Audience Requests‘

The second half of the show
featured audience requests, among
them “W a b a s h Cannonball,”
“Turkey in the Straw," and “Jesse
James.” -

Martin said that the Travel-
lers, who have been together
about 11 years, started singing
out of their common interest in
Mountain music. In character-
izing their style, he agreed with
Carson who said that it is “rore
of a high-pitched singing—sort
of hard to describe."

Martin noted that part of the
audience were “regulars” at his
“Bluegrass” sessions originating
out of Walsh’s Lounge in East Li-
berty on Saturday nights.

jHAPPINESS CAN’T BUY. MONEY

Withtuition costs steadily on the" rise, more and more under-.
graduates are looking into the student loan plan. If you are
one such, you would do well to consider the case of Leonid

Sigafoos.

Leonid, the son of an unemployed-bean gleaner in‘Strai—ght-
ened Circumstances, Montana, had his heart set on going to
college, but his father, alas, could not afford to send him.
Leonid applied for a Regents Scholarship, but his reading
speed, alas, was not very rapid—three words an hour—and
before he could ﬁnish the ﬁrst page of his exam, the Regents

_ had closed their briefcases crossly and gone home. Leonid then
applied for an athletic scholarship, but he had, alas, only a single
athletic skill—-picking up beebees with his toes——and this, alas,
aroused only ﬂeeting enthusiasm among the coaches.

And then——happy day!—Leonid learned of the student loan
plan: he could borrow money ‘for his tuition and repay it in
easy installments after he left school! I

lege of Lanolin and _Restoration'Drama and happily began a
college career that grew happier year by year. Indeed, it be-
came altogether ecstatic in his senior year because Leonid met ;
a coed named Anna Livia. Plurabelle with hair like beaten gold

~ and eyes like two socketsﬁfull of Lake Louise. Love gripped

them in its big moist palm,
Crispin’s Day.

and theywere betrothed on St.

Happily they made plans to be married immediately’ after
commencement—plans, alas, that were never to come to fruition
because Leonid, alas, learned that Anna Livia, like himself,
was in college on a student loan, which meant that he not only

had to repay his own loan
' 'Livia’s and the’

after graduation but also Anna.

job, alas, that was waiting for Leonid’ at the

Butte Otter Works simply did not pay enough, alas, to cover
both loans, plus rent and food and clothing and television

Heavy hearted, ‘Leonid and Anna Livia sat down and lit
Marlboro Cigarettes and tried to ﬁnd an answer to their prob- A

lem—and, sure enough, they

did! I do not knowwhether or

not Marlboro Cigarettes helped them ﬁnd an answer; all I know
is that Marlboros taste good and look good and ﬁlter good, and
when the clouds gather and the world is black as the pit from
pole to pole, it is a heap of comfort and "satisfaction to be sure
that,Marlboros will always provide the same easy pleasure

the same unstinting tobacco flavor, in all times and climes and

conditions. That’s all I know.

Leonid and Anna Livia, I say, did ﬁnd an answer-—-a very

simple one: If their student loans did not come

due until they

left school, why then they just wouldn’t leave school !» So after
‘receiving their bachelor's degrees, they re-enrolled and took
master's degrees. After that they took doctor’s degrees —'loads’
and loads of the1n—until today Leonid and Anna Livia, both

aged 87, both still in school,

hold doctorates in Philosophy,

V Humane. Letters, Jurisprudence, Veterinary Medicine, Civil
Engineering, Optometry, Woodpulp, and Dewey Decimals.

Their student loans, at the end of the last

fiscal year,

amounted to zrcombined total of nineteen million dollars——a
sum, which they probably, would have found some diﬂiculty in
repaying had not the Department of theglnterior recently. de-

clared them a National Park.
