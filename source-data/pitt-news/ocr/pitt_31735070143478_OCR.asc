While the Pitt baseball
team dicln’t have a par-
ticularly hot season, Sean
Conley’s bat was red—hot
all year long.

After a strong senior
season, he hopes to be
selected in the upcoming
MLB Draft June 5. i

As the leadoff hit-
ter, Conley started all 53
games and batted .3l 7 on
the year. He led the Pan-
thers in home runs (ll),
hits (7l), doubles (17),
RBIs (48), slugging per-
centage (.540) and runs
scored (48), all-career
highs for the left ﬁelder.

While the Panthers (19--
34, 8-20 Big East) missed
the Big East tournament
this year, Conley’s perfor-
mance has garnered the
interest of numerous MLB
franchises.

“He’s proven that he
can hit at the next level,”
said associate head coach
Joel Dombkowsl<i. “He’s
hit some of the best play-
ers in the Big East con-
sistently enough t_o show

that he deserves a c
at it.”

Dombl<owsl<i isn’t all
talk. He’s coached several
players who’ve gone on to
the pros and knows what
to—»'lool< for. Last year, six
Pitt players were either
signed or drafted by major

The city of Pittsburgh ruled

A last week that two Oakland

apartment complexes were un-
ﬁt for habitation by man,‘ beast
or Pitt student.

The city’s Bureau of Build-
ing Inspection posted.large, red
signs with the caveat, “Danger,

Keep out”‘ on the apartment I

buildings at 331 and 337 Mc-
Kee Place last Wednesday and
ordered that all residents va-
cate by the following Monday.
' BB1 “ordered these build-
ings closed based on violations
of the State Building Code”
according, to Chief Building
Inspector Dan Cipriani.
Among the violations at 331
McKee Place, inspectors re-
portedly found that the ﬁre es-
capes were unsafe. In addition,
the ceilings and doors were not
properly ﬁre-rated. ‘These vio-
lations, however, were not the
ﬁrst for the building.
According to Cipriani, the
property has been a place of in-
terest for inspectors since 20_06.
This week’s round of problems
proved to be the last straw for
the city of Pittsburgh.

    "Life on Mars" found, proves quite artistic  

by Jacob Spears
Staﬂ WrL'ter

Nothing feels more like Mar-

tian territory than “Life on Mars:
.55th Carnegie Intemationa1”
than
“Cavemanman.”

Thomas Hirschhom’s

The 2002 installation’ piece

aims to transport viewers into

‘a desolate and dangerous un-
derground. The imagery evokes
a sense of being in a bunker
during a nuclear fallout. But a
closer inspection shows that an
eclectic collection of revolution-
any books 5 works by Chom-

7 sky, Nietzsche and Man: — are

hooked up to dynamite that is
wired directly to the minds of

aluminum foil } sculptures of
earthly beings.-i _ ,

It’s a ﬁtting centerpiece to
“Life on Mars,” the Carnegie
Museum of Art’s most recent in-
ternational collection of works
from 40 artists around the globe.
“Cavemanman” imaginatively
displays the curatorial questions
the exhibition asks: “Are we

alone in the universe? Do aliens
exist? Or are we, ourselves, the
strangers in our own world?”
While the concept of revolu-
tionary works of literature as cra-
nial time bombs certainly’isn’t
something new, Hirschhom’s
environment is so seemingly
extraterrestrial that the piece’s
originality comes from’ asking

how alienated humanity has be-
come from its own intellectual
consciousness.

While this might seem pretty
heady, the majority of the works

Douglas Fogle for the museum.’ s

way. '

Murderer gets life

by Hayley Grgurich
AAaz}1tanZNewc1 E9[tor
A fonner Pitt student convicted
of ﬁrst—degree murder for stabbing,
decapitating, eviscerating and dis-
membering his roommate in 2006
was sentenced to life in prison with-
out parole last Wednesday mom-

_mg-

The judge also added one to two
years to James M. Baldwin’s sen-
tence for abuse of a corpse.

Baldwin became a suspect in
the murder of his roommate, then-
CCAC student Brendon Martin,
after Martin’s remains were discov-
ered in a-shallow grave in Collier,
three miles from the home the two
men shared with Baldwin’s girl-

friend and her daughter in Carnegie, r

according to the Post-Gazette.

A Collier maintenance worker

noticed suspicious bicycle tracks

and footprints that lead to a seclud-

ed wooded area Martin was identi- ‘ ‘

ﬁed by a tattoo. _
Although the stated motive var-

ied throughout the two-year trial

from insanity to self—defense to an

-altercation ignited by Baldwin’s be- ,

lief that Martin’s marijuana smok-
ingcaused Baldwin’s girlﬁiend to
suifer a miscarriage, a jury ruled
that Baldwin’s actions. occurred
while he was sound of mind.

L Kevin Abramovitz, Baldwin’s
attorney at the time of the sentenc-
ing, told the Post—Gazette Baldwin
plans to appeal the conviction.

The sentence came on the anni-
versary of Martin’s birth. He would
have been 22.

Fire strikes apartments slated forinspection

“We would rather an incon-
venience than a tragedy,” said
Cipriani. “When it comes to
life safety, everyone needs to
comply, and when violations
are sent, they are not to be tak-
en lightly.” .

The .building’s owner, Ja-

‘son Cohen, suffered more bad,
news when he found himself:
at the center of another prob-

lematic housing situation just a
few’ blocks away. The 42—unit
apartment complex at 3408
Parkview Ave. was ordered
by the city to undergo a thor-
ough and complete inspection
Thursday, in light of similar
concerns as his McKee Place
property.

clear up any misconceptions
that the buildings were being

“Right now,” he said, “there

_is deﬁnitely an incentive for

the owners of the properties to

possible.

“If they "are able to do so,
then everyone can come back,”
he said. “Students don’t need
to move out, they just can not
live in the building until it has
been brought up to code.”

South Oakland not up

to code

A Building violations should bring 
; action from University, community

l

I South Oakland has long had
‘ a reputation among Pitt students
9 and other residents for being un-
, ruly and dangerous. And it seems
i that this reputation will soon get
 much worse. Last week, the city
i ordered the shutdown of ‘two
3 South Oakland apartment build-
; ings because of ﬁre code viola-
. tions.

The city’s Bureau of Build-
ing Inspection rarely shuts down
apartment buildings, but the two
buildings on McKee Place had
become unlivable. As reported
by the Post-Gazette, one of the
buildings was cited for gas odors,
inadequate smoke detectors,
doors with insufﬁcient ﬁre resis-
tance and inoperable windows.
While these citations were ﬁled
two years ago, the owner failed to

3 rect the mistakes.

I Mayor Luke Ravenstahl told
. the Post-Gazette, “We’ve taken
7 this unique step to really show
f that we’re serious about this.” ”

j City codes exist for a reason
 — to be enforced. Until now, it
 seems that few people took the
 codes seriously. Shutting down
 the apartment buildings sends
i an important message not just to
‘j landlords who fail to take care
‘ of building violations but also to
 students and other Oakland resi-

I
- 1 dents who might be afraid to re-

; port problems. The Post—Gazette
reported that the McKee Place
apartments were shut down after
two Oakland residents called for
the Ofﬁce of Municipal Investi-
gations to look into city code en_-
. forcement in the neighborhood.

I But not all residents are quick
to report problems. Many stu-
dents who live in apartments are
often willing to bear dangerous
living conditions because they
know that they will be moving
out in just a few months. But in
order to make Oakland 21 better
place to live, this has to change.

Students should do their part in

Part of the problem lies with Q
the University. Pitt has a respon- 
sibility to play a more active lead-

code enforcement in off-carnpus 
areas. The University has much 
to gain with stronger off—carnpus 
housing and should work with the 
city to make sure the codes are 1

has done a good job of this with
their Off Campus Living survey. 
Students were able to grade their 
landlords, and the results were 
then posted on the SGB Web site 3
for prospective tenants to see.

As it currently stands, more
than 15 of the landlords listed
received at least one D in the j
landlord.evaluations. More than 
40 landlords received at least one 
D or F in their apartment interior 5
evaluations. And more than 10 
landlords received at least one D E
or F in their apartment exterior
evaluations.

Obviously, reporting prob- J
lems is not always as simple as 
clicking a mouse. Oftentimes, re-
porting violations directly to the
city can be a difﬁcult process and
tenants might have to wait a long
time before they see a response. 
There‘ should be more communi- 
cation between the students, the
University and the city so that the
reporting procedure can be made
as straightforward as possible.

If serious improvement is to
be made, every side —— from the
landlords to the students to the
University — has an obligation
to take action in its own way. Just
because off-campus housing is
not under Pitt’s direct responsibil-
ity does not mean it shouldn’t be
up to University standards.

About two weeks ago, the Amer-

ican Lung Association released a ’

report on the United States’ most air-
polluted cities. The traditional leader
of ﬂre pack, Los Angeles, has been
replaced by Pittsburgh.

Although Pittsburgh’s status as
the most air-polluted city in the Unit-
ed States certainly perpetuates im-
ages of a city dominated by dirty and
polluting steel factories, Pittsburgh’s
rating is not so much a reﬁection of
increased pollution in the city as it is
a reﬂection of an increase in cleaner
technologies and elforts to reduce
particle pollution in other metropoli-
tan areas.

Nevertheless, Pittsburgh’s sta-
tus asthemostpollutedcity inthe
United States must be met with ur-
gency. Aside from the environmental
aspects, the levels of pollution in the
city present signiﬁcant health risks as
well.

Fortunately, Mayor Luke Raven-
stahl has “taken to arms.” Vlflﬂrin the
last few weeks, Ravenstahl has com-
rnittedtotumvacantlotsinthecity
into “green” areas with urban farms
and community gardens. Additional-
ly, Pittsburgh recenﬂy partnered with
the Environmental Protection Agen-

, cyinaprojecttlratwillturn10ofthe

, city’s waste companies into green or-

ganizations through the adoption of
advanced A ernission-reduction tech-
nology.

Yet despite the recent initiatives
taken by Ravenstahl and Pittsburgh
in their commitment to reducing pol-
lution in the city, will the perceptions
of Pittsburgh as a dirty, smog-ﬁlled
area diminish? Or will the historical
images of the “Steel City,” which
have surely been corroborated by the
American Lung Association’s ﬁnd-
ings, be continued?

In a society so consumed with
making ﬂre environment cleaner and
safer, Pittsburgh’s reputation contin-
ues to be marred by its enviromnental
recorcL_After the closing of many of
the steel plants in the 1970s and 80s,
Pittsburgh underwent and continues
to undergo a major elfort to reinvent
its image.

The lots that were once dorr1i-
nated by booming smokestacks and
ash—cons11rned skies were replaced

‘ by chic and vibrant shopping centers.
Unfortunately, the ﬁndings of the -

American Lung Association seem
to promote historical images of Pitts-
burgh rather than an up-and-comirrg
city that is a leader in medicine, edu-
cation, technology and ﬁnancial ser-
vices.

Following Los Angeles’ ranking
as Arr1erica’s most air-polluted city in

,TJre Pitt‘Ne,ws 0 ,vs(vvw.pittnews.com

‘ E07, Los Angeles Mayor Antonio
, Vlllaraigosa made it a top priority

to trim Los Angeles into Arnerica’s
largest “green” city. Through exten-
sive environmental policies ranging
‘from the expansion of renewable en-
ergy resources and preserving water
to simply planting more trees in the
city, Los Ange1es’s swift response to
its ranking as America’s most pol-
luted city has already seen results.

Consequently, L.A. has become
a leader in eco—friendly technolo-
gies. Most notable, however, is Los
Angeles’ quick response to reduce
dangerous diesel exhaust emissions
ﬁom trucks, buses and port opera-
tions through widespread legislation.

Unlike Los Angeles, Pittsburgh’s
investment in more energy—efﬁcient
resources and a cleaner environment
has been more gradual. Addressing
pollution and enviromnental prob-
lems has been a signiﬁcant issue in
Pittsburgh since the 1940s. Yet the
same steel corporations that were
largely responsible for Pittsburgh’s
previous environmental issues con-
tinue to harm the environment.

U.S. Steel’s Clairton Works coke-
producing plant has been arguably
the most signiﬁcant player in the high
levels of ash, soot and diesel exhausts
that contribute to particle pollution in
the Pittsburgh region Although U.S.

Steel has committed to modifying

Colummlit

 
   
 

Yesterday, while I was travel-
ing through the wide webs of the
Internet, I stumbled upon some-
thing that ﬁrst made me giggle
and then subsequently pause for
ponderous contemplation. It was
a radio story about a man and his

dream: to open a theme park in‘

Tennessee that would feature his-
torical and exhilarating represen-
tations of the Bible. The tentative
title for this project, slated to be
the largest Bible theme park in
America, is Bible Park USA.

I love themed things, wheth-
er they are parks, parties‘o_r_ pet
names. And I love the ideas pro-
posed for\ some of Bible Park

USA’s attractions, such as the_

parting of the Red Sea complete
with shooting water and Moses
talking overhead. I don’t quite
know how they’ll work in the
log ﬂume, but I’m sure it will all
cometogether in the end.

Reading’ about Bible Park
USA got me thinking about all
the other potential theme parks,
such as:

The “Oh, so that’s how it
would have turned out” Park: OK,
think “It’s a Wonderful Life,” but
with no Jimmy Stewart and a bit
more of a personal touch. This
park capitalizes on that universal
desire, to know what could have
been if you had taken a different
fork in the road. _

The technology is a bit com-
plicated in these early planning
stages, but I imagine it will in-

volve some sort of virtual reality
helmet that taps into the part of
your brain that lights up when
you think of all your past regrets.
Then, the supercomputer that
is in charge of the whole thing

makes up alternate endings that _

would result from making differ-
ent choices.

Some possible featured rides
would be the “What if I didn’t
quit my job roller coaster” and
“The one that got away tunnel of
love.” Park-goers could set their
virtual reality helmets to deter-
mine whether these alternate
endings were positive or nega-
tive. For example, if you want
to convince yourself that you’ve
done a smashing job making de-
cisions about your life, you can

set your helmet to reﬂect only
the negative outcomes of the de-
cisions you didn’t make.

Or, if you’re self-pitying and
melodramatic, you can set your
helmet to make it so that a differ-
ent path of choices would have
made your life way more totally
awesome than it is right now.
And maybe we’d have a Jimmy
Stewart cardboard cutout for
photo-ops or something.

The “This is what a roller
coaster was supposed to be!”
Park: I’m from a small town
in eastern Pennsylvania. This
town, Jim Thorpe, has an ab-
surd amount of claims to fame
for its piteous size and lack of
brand—narne establishments. One
of these attractions is the his-

toric Mauch Chunk Switchback

Gravity Railroad site, which was
a coal—rrrining train that eventu-
ally took passengers for thrilling
ﬁve—mile—an—hour trips down the
mountainside, assuming the role
of the ﬁrst ever “roller coaster.”
The “This is what a roller
coaster was supposed to be!”
Park adopts a more traditional,
historic interpretation of “roller
coasters” and their amusement

the plant so as to lessen pollution,

the damage done to the Pittsburgh
environment is so reprehensible that
local leaders should demand that the

g project be expedited

described as being “hell with the lid ,

dards.

Additionally, Pitlsburghihas be-
gun investing in alternative energy
sources, speciﬁcally solar and wind
power. Yet it is time that Pittsburgh’s
response to its environmental issues
took a more aggressive approach
Although I applaud the city for its

stance on controlling the particle pol-
lution in the air.

Whether through new legislation that
eﬂ°ectively ﬁnes corporations that
do, not control their levels of particle
emissions, much like Los Angeles
has done, or through the development
of newer and cleaner technologies on
buildings, trucks, buses and boats, it

park counterparts. After you hop
on the “Coal train,” you’ll roller-
coast right into the coal mine,
where you’ll be led on a spooky
haunted house-esque tour of‘ the
dark mine by some little kids
with coal-dusted faces and the
whisper of Black Lung hanging
in the future. Sound drastic? Try
realistic.

Other rides featured in the
park would be that ride with the
big pirate ship that swings back
and forth until you’re hanging in
niid-air. And when you’re safely
grounded, you’ll be attacked by
real pirates who will rob you
blind and steal your women and
children. Doesn’t it ﬁll your heart
with true amusement?

But perhaps the most success-
ful ride will be the “Lost Child-
hood” swingset. You’ll spend an
exhilarating few minutes ﬂying
through the air on the swings.
And when you alight back on
park soil, you’ll weep with the
memories of your faded juvenile
innocence and mourn for what
could have been — an appropri-
ate time to make your way to the
“Oh, so that’s how it would have
turned out” Park.

The “Let’s ignore the seri-
ous problems facing our com-
munity and head to the theme
park” Park: This park offers the
most radical proposition thus far:
a place where you can come and
drop 40 bucks, not including re-
freshments, to jump onto rides
that ﬁll you with primal fear as-
sociated with defying the laws of
physics so that you can’t think
of the recessing economy if you
tried.

Along with the rides would be
other less intense amusements,
such as a fun boat trip through
a briar patch in the old South,
forgiven its faults, because in
this ride bunnies and bears play
all of the racist characters, so it’s
totally cute! i

The day will culminate in ﬁre- A

works and a parade full of icons
such as less-than—personable
princesses, superheroes and oth-
er people we teach our children
to strive to become. This park’s
philosophy is: If it’s shaped like
a Barbie or doesn’t have to pay
bills, then put it in the parade.

ranging from painting and sculp-

Summer is ﬁnally here, which

to‘ glorious days of no classes, trips to
the beach, parties, hanging out with
friends and, of course, summer jobs
and internships. Well,.maybe you’re
not looking forward to that last one

to wear boring work clothes all day
doesn’texacﬂy addtotheexcitement.

As a business student, ﬂiere are
plenty of times when an event calls
for me to wear business professional
——-meaning dull — suits. But it’s a
necessary evil, especially for _inter—
views and other professional events
like job fairs.

might seem fairly self—explanatory,
there are a lot of little extra things to

Also, consider your ﬁgure when
choosing a suit There are many op-

the jacket, the length of the jacket,
the leg width of pants and the length

_ a signiﬁcant impact on how your

body looks, as anyone who has
watched Clinton Kelly on “What

knows.

Shoes shouldn’t be particularly

Death Cab’s latest is
anything but deceased

by Dan Vetanovetz

 
   
   

Ben Gibbard has re-
" ~,;.}\ tumed with the next
 lustrous entry in Death
 Cab for Cutie’s solid his-
tory with “Narrow Stairs.”
Smooth lyrics accompany
strategically reserved guitar and piano streaks
that break away into rock passages at precisely
calculated moments, delivering an experi-
ence accomplished by time—hardened lessons.
Fans who listened to DCFC’s last album,
“Plans,” more often than going to class will
experience a poignant oonﬂict: This album is
not in the same style as the quirkier indie al-
bum from 2005. However, hearing Gibbard’s
vocals break in the ﬁrst track will revive latent
frustrations piled up from a three—year wait
only to relieve them promptly. ‘
Whereas previous albums sounded person-
al and had an edge of anxiety driving the tracks
into the hearts of indie hipsters nationwide,
“Narrow Stairs” displays moreconﬁdence and
easily ﬂowing vocals. ‘Don’t,let the postrnod—
em album cover fool you, this album is acces-

sible and shouldbe accessed by anyone with '
' an appreciation for music. ’

The album’s opening track, “Bixby Can-
yon Bridge,” drifts more than ﬁve minutes
from silence to a rock crescendo. While the
vocals are more mature than previous al-
bums, they display the
familiar wistful irnagi— S
nation that has become
a Gibbard trademark. -

An acoustic intro :

If something didn’t hap-
pen at that precise 'mo— V
ment halfway through
the song, the entire album
would ﬂop. ‘
But Cutie pulls up just
in time, and it’s only after A
the power chords christen '
the quiet ship that listen— ‘_ '
ers realize the band knew what it was doing all
along. The suspense was intended. Gibbard’s
reverbed vocals leap in right after the power
chords, and the lively beatdrives the song to
its end. ‘ i
Showing music savvy, the following track,
“I Will Possess Your Heart,” begins with a

"calm and steady four-minute lead-in to coun-
- ter the smashing close of “Bixby.” Strong and

clear piano chords are accompanied by distant
guitar mutterings. I

The vocals kick in with hard syncopation
and lyrics that are frightening in their direct
delivery, as Gibbard practically orders: “How
I wish you could see the potential / the poten-
tial of you and me.” A more solemn statement
follows this promise: “And I know that you’ll
ﬁnd love / I will possess your heart.” '

In reassurance that Cutie is still sensitive
and even sentimental, “No Sunlight” follows,

. which would be an emo track if not for Gib-

bard’s cheerful ‘delivery of lines about gray
clouds. Taken alone, the song would be too
poppy, but the follow up, “Cath  ,” marvel-
ously bookends it.

The guitar parts make restrained bellows,
and Gibbard’s voice once again jumps into the
fray, making exultant appeals to Cath, pulling
apart her life story in song form.

‘The eighth track, “Your New Twin Sized
Bed,” tells a story in a similar way, opening
with two witty lines: “You look so defeated
lying there in your new twin size bed /‘with
a single pillow undemeath your single head.”
The entire song provides an allure in its dic-
tion that is undeniable, breaking up the normal
second—half blues.

“Pity and Fear” carries on the strong con-
clusion, building up from an ode to a squeal of
guitars, crashing into the brooding “The Ice is
Getting Thinner,” which conjures smart imag-
es with the line “what ﬂows under our feet bled
into the sea” when paired with vocals draining

‘i away in the album’s ﬁnal moments.

Yet even in these last moments, Death Cab
offers a ﬁrm declaration of its maturity. It offers
the album’s ﬁ-

_ . nal persona in
§ the form of a



ics, even tracks
like “You
Can Do Bet-
ter _Than Me”
offer bounc-
ing A - vocals
 and energet-
ic guitar performance that are more like
a shameless amelioration than a lament

_ The ending sensation is one of emotional
accomplishment, as Gibbard and his merry
company shrug olf each fusillade of destructive
relationships. Death Cab for Cutie has reached
a state of balance with “Narrow Stairs,” pro-
viding the problem and the solution to emo-
tional fumbling all in the same package.

that when compared to newer works by
artists such as Richard Wright and Ranjani

Shettar.

Wright’s mesmerizing wall design of pat-
temed golf tees painted to the wall of the mu-
seum, and Shettar’s 2006 “Just a bit more,”
an installation of suspended wax beads that
seem to hangfrozen in time, seem to be in-
quiries into human consciousness’ place in
the world. In co'mpan'son,Conner and CClII1-

ins seem to simply be making pedestrian ob- -

servations. .
One of the nicer features, of “Life on
Mars” is that a number of the artists con-

tributed to a service in-which museum— goers i

may use their cell phones to listen to artists
talk about their works while they go through
the gallery. The number and extensions are
placed throughout the gallery by participat-
ing artists’ works. '

Fogle has stated that he came up with
the title from the David Bowie song of the
same name. Like the song, the 55th Carnegie
International isn’t a. search for aliens but a
question of whether or not there is escape
from the pangs of existence on earth.

“Life on Mars” feels. like a museum of

global folk art: a collection of simple expres-
sions with a consciousness of humanity’s
place not only in the world but the universe.

A Perhaps years in the future, when cosmic

travelers visit Earth and go to museums to
see what type of ancient art earthlings pro-
duced, this is the stuff they’ll ﬁnd.

a skirt, steer clear of shoes with an ankle strap
that will visually cut your leg oﬁ° at the ankle
and leave them looking short Using acces-
sories like fun belts and shoes in a variety of
colors and textures are a great way to make
boring pants and shirts a little more “you.”
Skinny, brightly colored belts are particu-
larly popular right now and are an easy way to
add a quick dose of polish to your outfit Your
shoes and belt deﬁnitely don’t have to match,
but complementary colors are key. Prints are
big this season, and wrap dresses are a work-ap-

propriate choice to showcase your favorite pat-
terns and liven up a monotonous Wednesday.

Ofﬁces can be chilly even when it’s scorch-
ing outside, so don’t forget to top off your
look, withcolorful cardigans and ﬁtted blaz-
ers. These chic toppers can also make a lot of
your favorite tank tops work-ready and really
help expand your workday wardrobe. Finish
things off with a bold statement—making piece
of jewelry like the. big baubles from J .Crew,
and if there were a‘ “style” section on your
performance appraisal, you’d be guaranteed to

receive top marks. .
The bottom line in staying out of the._red at

work is that if you have any doubts, you prob-

ably shouldn’t wear it Obviously, what you
can wear to work varies from job to job. If you
want to be taken seriously, though, it’s prob
ably best to take pride in your appearance no
matter what ﬁeld you’re in —— it shows your
boss that you’re serious about your job and
care about the work that you’re doing. After

all, there will be plenty of time after work to V

wear all your teensy shorts and sundresses.

One thing on his side ‘is the

American sports, the number is
incredible. ’ ' '

The NBA Draft, for example,
lasts two rounds and sees 60 players
taken. The NFL Draft ‘has seven

rounds. .

For players trying to make it at
the next level, this is good news. But
it also means those players will have

something Conley said he’s more
than willing to deal with.

Track and Field

Five Panthers to
compete in regionals

by Adam Littman
Senior Staﬂ Writer

A weekend trip to Princeton, N.J., re-
sulted in a number of positives for both
the men’s and women’s track and ﬁeld
teams as they competed in the IC4A and
ECAC Outdoor championships.

For the women, ﬁve Panthers were
rewarded with invitations to the NCAA
Regionals, as the team ﬁnished tied for
seventh overall with 38‘ points.

On the men’s Side, A.J. Kielinski set
the school record for the hammer throw
with his toss of 54.91 meters. He passed
Patrick Harding’s then-record of 54.17
meters set in 2002.

_Shantea Calhoun scored two invita- S

tions to regionals. In the 100-meter dash,
she improved upon third—place ﬁnishes
in preliminaries and semi-ﬁnals to ﬁnish
second in the ﬁnals with a time of 11.62.
She also qualiﬁed in the 200 with her
score of 23.96, earning a third—place ﬁn-
ish.

Pitt almost had two runners qualify for
regionals on the 100-meter hurdles.

Mycaiah Clemons ﬁnished fourth ‘ in
the event with a time of 13.81, but Brian-
na Broyles missed the cut with her 10th-

place ﬁnish.

Broyles bounced back to qualify on
the 400»hurdles with a time of '1 minute,
52 seconds.

Amy Ruffolo will join her teammates
at the NCAA Regionals with her time of
10:48.79 in the 3000-meter Steeplechase.

The ﬁnal qualiﬁer for the women was
the 4x100-meter relay team, which ﬁn-
ished second in the ﬁnals with a time of
42.62. ,

i Those who qualiﬁed for regionals will
head to Tallahassee, Fla., on May 30 for
the two-day meet. 8

Although no male Panthers quali-
ﬁed, many earned top—20 ﬁnishes at the
IC4As.

Kielinski’s record toss placed 16th in
the hammer throw.

Eric Jones landed in 14th position in
the triple jump with his score of 14.59m.

Finishing 17th in the javelin was Matt
Raquet with his throw of 57.09m.

Freshman Antony Hobwana claimed
19th in the 200, while Curtis Larimer
placed 17th in the 10,000-meter run.

The 4x100-meter relay team ﬁnished
18th with its time of 42.24.

Sam Perkins’ time of 10.77 earned a
top-15 ﬁnish in the 100, landing in 14th.

‘‘It’s just been about waiting for my pitc ”
said Conley. “I’m sitting back and looking for
something in the zone.”

A lot of this also has to do with leverage,
which Conley manages to get a lot of because of
his great balance at the plate.

Dombkowski said this increase in power
came from getting to the batting cages early and
keeping his focus.

cannot be matched league-wide, with
perennial Norris Trophy candidate and
team captain Nicklas Lidstrom plus
Brian Rafalski.

Rafalski, a former Devil and re-
nowned speedster, complements Lid-
stom’s game, playing a smart, almost
methodical style of hockey.

Pittsburgh counters with perennial
Norris Trophy snub Sergei Gonchar
and bruiser Brooks Orpik, who has
been playing the best hockey of his ca-
reer.

Niklas Kronwall and Brad Stu-
art bring a balanced attack as the Red
Wings’ second pairing, but the Pen-
guins have a shutdown duo with their
Rob Scuderi-Hal Gill combination.

The third pairing for Detroit fea-
tures either rookie Derek Meech and
46-year-old Chris Chelios or the duo
of Andreas Lilja and. Brett Lebda.

The Penguins’ third twosome is an
offensive one, featuring Ryan Whitney
and rookie Kris Letang. Waiting in the
wings for his first playoff appearance
of the season is veteran Darryl Sydor.

Advantage: Red Wings —— Experi-

ence and consistency give Detroit a
better back end to their defense.

May 21, 2008

Goaltenders

The Red Wings’ goaltenders have
a combined 23 years on the Penguins
duo, but that shouldn’t stop Fleury and
Ty Conklin from outplaying Detroit.

With Dominik Hasek playing poor-
ly in the first round, head coach Mike
Babcock subbed in Osgood and hasn’t
looked back.

Osgood replaced Hasek midway
through the first round against Nash-

ville and has posted a 10-2 record with
a 1.60 goals-against average.

Fleury’s GAA in the playoffs comes
a close second with 1.70, but his save
percentage is tops in the postseason at
.938.

While Conklin has yet to play in
the playoffs, he provided significant
support throughout the regular season
when Fleury was out with a high ankle
sprain.

Advantage: Push —- The Red Wings
have the experience, but the aged bod5”
ies might be a bit fatigued.

The Pens are riding a hot Fleury, but
he could falter against an offense like
Detroit’s.

While the advantages come out as
a push, I see the Penguins taking the
series in six games with Crosby and
company click.
