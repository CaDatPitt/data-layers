Recommendation Plans

Student Poll
On New Budget

Chance-llor’s Plans
Include‘ Completion

‘Of Cathedral Interior

.Intei;sst aroused ’ among’ the un-
rdergraduate student body over the
publication of the eight point bud-
%get of Chancellor John G. Bowman,
will be tabulated when
News conducts a student poll this
week.

Dr. Bowman’s budget calls for an
expenditure of $6,000,000 for num-
;-erous improvements of the physical
needs at the University.

The budget includes the building
of everything from a student union
building to a skating rink. Largest
among these items, according to the
Chancellor, are the completion of
the interior of the Cathedral, the
-spending of $1,400,000 for a medical
research building and the $1,300,000
for a student union building. ‘

Polling among the students will
‘begin today and continue through
the week in order to secure a com-
plete verdict of a large cross-sec-
'tion of the students.

This will necessitate the inter-
'viewing‘ of students from all schools
in the University and from all class-
/es. A certain percentage of both
weds and coeds will be contacted.

As student opinion is supposed to
be a basic factor of University life,
it was deemed advisable by the Pitt
News to conduct a poll and See
which of the eight points of the
"budgets the students considered
rnost vital. V

In this way, students will be able
‘to evaluate the ideas they have in
‘regard to the importance of each
item as outlined on the budget.

Science Instructors
Will Rate Applicants
For Medical Schools

The College of the University has
worked out a new system of recom-
mendation for pre-medical students,
according to an announcement by
Dr.‘Omar C. Held, personnel assist-
ant to the dean of the College.

, The system applies to all sopho-
more, , junior, and senior pre-med-
ical students. Two or three recom-
mendations from their science
teachers must be submitted upon
applying for medical schools.

When a st,udent.applies.t0 med-
ical school, his science teachers are
usually "asked to recommend him.
It has fie-quently happened in the
past that three science teachers
were ‘asked to write letters of rec-
ommend.at;ion for one student.

These requests for information in
many cases came to the instructors
two or even three years after the
applicant had been in their class.
At such a late date the instructors
found it rather difficult to give the
ﬂledical‘ school a just appraisal of
the student. I

In order to assist students and al-
so to give medical schools as com-
plete and authentic a report as pos-
sible, rating sheets were prepared,
Dr. Held explained. These forms
are carefully ﬁlled out by each
science teacher at the time he has
the student in the class. ,

The rating forms are then filed
in the College oﬂice. When a re-
quest for a recommendation is
made, a copy of this form is sent
from the office to the medical school
requesting it. v

This system has proved itself suc-
cessful since its inauguration at the
University, and has resulted in the
medical schools being furnished the
most authentic information possible
on a stud.ent, Dr. Held stated.

Campaign. Fails

To Meet Quota i

Because of the decrease in the
amount of student pledges this year
it was impossible fo-r the ‘Univer-
sity to meet its quota of $10,000 in
the Community Fund campaign, to-
day, reported J. G. Quick, Univer-
sity registrar.

This year $2,076 in student sub-
scriptions was pledged as against
‘last year’s $2,832. Thevfa’cult'y sub-
scri~ption's" this year however ex-
ceeded last ye_ar’_s. In 1938 the fac-
ulty contributed $7,356.40; this year
it gave $7,503.75. "

In ‘a letter to the University or-
ganizations Mr. Quick said, “May I
take this opportunity to tell you
‘how much I appreciate the splendid
,service. that you rendered in behalf
{of the 1939‘ Community Fund cam-
gpaign at ‘the. University.”

“It will be noted that although
:theAtotal faculty subscriptions ex-
.ce.eded,e_the 1938 ﬁgure, the falling
off in “the student pledges made it
"impossible forus to meet our quota.
This is particula,rl_y regrettable, for
a student total equal to that reached

~ last year’ wouldhave put the Uni.-
versityiwell over the top.”

The news-making Independent
Party rolleduinto. the headlines
again this weekcas the gears of the
non-fraternity organization began
turning in what is expected to be
the liveliest campus political cam-
paign in years.

Announcing-theelection of a 12-
member steering committee that
will guide the organization through
the stormy pre-election months, In-
dependent leaders hinted that de-
velopments in the political ﬁeld this
week may bring “the election of a
new “party head” to .replace the
long-time control of veteran polit-
ical chief Jack I-Ioeveler, C40, and
his popular second lieutenant, J.
Karl Stark. C40.. _

Named to the exceutive commit-
tee at last weeks regular party con-
clave were Stark; Hoevel.er, Rug-
.£=.‘ero Aldisert, C41; Fred Robie,

ton, C42; and Bernadette Blatt, C42.

The executive group will choose
its chairman at this week’s meeting,
it was announced. Although the
executive committee chairman will
have only the nominal duties of a
presiding oﬁﬁc-er at the organization
meeting, according to the party an-
nouncenient, it is believed that the
post will go to the party member
slated for control of the non-fra-
ternity group.

At last week’s Independent meet-
ing it was decided that party poli-
tics should be “adjourned” for the

-present on campus to permit the In-

dependent steering committee to
launch a proposed investigation in-

— to the scanty balloting i.n the an-

nual May campus elections. The
group will initiate an investigation
oi’ the causes of student non-inter-
est in campus balloting.

University Athletes
May Organize Club

0' Kristufek Invites Letter Winners to Attend
a 4Discussion Meeting for Undergraduate Group

Va_rsit_v lettermen will meet in 208 Cathedral at 1:30 o’clock
today to discuss plans for organizing a permanent undergraduate

letter club.

Purposeof this organization, according to Joe Kristufek, C40,
varsity tennis star and temporary chairman of the group, IS “to

promote a more friendly and co-
operative spirit among all Uni-
versity athletes.”

Stating that there has been a
long-felt need for such an or-
ganizatioii working for -the mu-
tual beneﬁt of all athletes at the
University, Kristufek urges all let-
termen to attend the initial meeting
today to hear tentative plans of the
group" and offer suggestions f0I‘
forming the club.

Activities Outlined

Many other large universities
throughout the United States have
formed undergraduate clubs, and
have found that they have created
a friendlier relationship among the
athletes of various sports, accord-
ing to Kristufek.

This club, he emphasizes, will
have no connection with the Var-
sity Letterman Club, a graduate or-
ganization, and expects to have ap-
proximately 125 varsity members
by June of this year, when all ath-
lc-tic letters will have been awarded.

Tentative plans of the group call
for meetings every two weeks, spon-
sorship of a University dance, and
the awarding of -pins to members.
The club will also cooperate with
the athletic department in the se-
lection of varsity awards, states
Kristufek.

Grady Advises

Acting as temporary faculty ad-
viser is Ben Grady, varsity swim-
ming coach and a former member
of the Michigan undergraduate let'-
terman’s club, considered‘ one of
the strongest organizations of its
type in the country. Other letter-
men besides Kristufek aiding in or-
ganizing the club are: Emil Narick,
BA40; Dick Cassiano, C40; Allan
McKee, M40; and Bob Johnson, C40.

Commenting on the formation of
the club, Kristufek stated: “All
University officials, members of the
athletic department, and undergrad-
uate letterman contacted have
promised their full-hearted cooper-
ation with the organization. There
is no reason why such a group
should not be formed at the Uni-
versity.” A

recess, will present a report of the
proceedings at the next meeting of

Hears Debate

Forensic Squads -Argue
Basic Claim Question

Questions will ﬂy today at the
annual University-Washington and
Jefferson Oregon cross-examination
style, non—decision debate sponsored
by the Inquiry Forum. The contest
will be held in 132 Cathedral at
12:30 o’clock.

The University side of the ques-
tion, “Resolved:» That the basic
cause of the war in Europe rests
with the Allies,” will be represent-
ed by Ed Beigel, C42, and Harold
Byer, C42, on th-e afflrmatlveiside.

The match is the ﬁrstt of three
scheduled for Inquiry Forum'dur-
ing the coming semester. The topic
of today’s debate is the official ques-
tion for all Pennsylvania colleges
this year.

Abe Wolovitz, C40, who has ar-
ranged this affair, states that it will
serve as an introduction for the
University’s varsity and freshmen
debaters who wi.ll carry it as one
of their major debates of the com-
ing debate season.

The Oregon style of debating
which will beused today is, in the
opinion of many debaters, a very
dimcult form in which the debater
must know “what he is talking
about.” As in a courtroom, the de-
bater must answer, after his con-
structive speech, questions present-
ed by his opponents.

Don’t Go a-Hunting
For Flagpoles, Mr. llalloran

Final item in the long series of expenses for the University
senior at graduation time has been a request for a. contribution to
the class memorial fund. Through this money, raised by a special
SFA Senior Memorial committee, graduating classes have atteinpted
to underwrite the cost of furnishings or small building additions for
the University.

Like several classes of the last few years, the class of 1939 raised
several hundred dollars for a memorial, planned as a ﬂagpole suit-
able for the Cathedral. This amount has not been large enough to
pay for any memorial which would be in keeping with the nature
of the Cathedral.

Several other classes have had identical experiences, chieﬂy be-
cause the drives for funds had preceded planning for memorials
which would be suitable and still within the probable budget.

\Ve realize that an attempt to collect even. 50 cents or a dollar
from seniors who are about to leave the comparative security of
college life is a difficult proposition.

\Ve’re not at all sure that the senior class memorial idea in its
present form is a good one. The apathy displayed by previous
classes indicates that most graduating seniors have been anything
but enthusiastic contributors.

This year’s Senior Memorial committee must avoid the experi-
ences of preceding classes, who raised money for projects which
did not materialize.

The News suggests that if the senior memorial tradition is
to be continued, that the committee turn their attention to seine
project for which there is a real need, and for which deﬁnite ar-
rangements can be made.

Chairman Tom Halloran might consider the possibility of coin-
bining this Y‘ta1"s fund with those of other classes to ﬁnish. a class
room in the Cathedral. Cr, instead of a building project, the senior
memorial inight well be a gift of books to the University library.
Both of these ideas would stand a much better chance of realization
than the flagpole-hunting activities of past senior memorial
committees.

Notes on Pitﬁs Fixture
Student Union Building

For many years now, the News has been a consistent advocate
of a student union for the University. Each year, that plan has
been reiterated editorially. Proofs of its value at other schools and
‘interpretations of its need at Pitt have appeared many times.

Now that it is a stated objective included in the new $6,000,000
building program, we should like to reiterate the stand taken by
the News over the years, and review in part thevalue of such a
building to the University students.

The object of a student union, and as we understand it, it is to
be a separate building here located on Frick Acres, is to centralize

‘ quarters for student activities, to provide lounges, restaurants, cafe-

terias, or sodalfountains, and other “loaﬁng” facilities; and to pro-
vide club and meeting rooms in which University organizations may
meet conveniently.

The union would contain, if possible, a large hall suitable for
holding dances. The handicaps of having a University affair off

‘ campus have been recognized. Such a hall would not only decrease
. dance costs, thus helping to pay for itself, but would ease the diffi-

culties of ru.nning such dances.

A student lounge and smoking rooms need scarely any proof
of their need. Additional eating quarters are more necessary now
that the new Tuck Shop will have a smaller seating capacity.

Adequate meeting rooms would do much to put spirit into the
somnolence of many University organizations. The difﬁculties of
ﬁnding a place n.ow act as a brake upon the ability ‘if many groups
to meet regularly. ,

,Activitics groups that are relatively permanent couldihave per-
manent headquarters with adequate facilities in the new building;

Thus a student union would not duplicate any facilities and
would provide muchthat is necessary toward a real “student” life.
\Ve urge that the building be given every consideration when pri-
ority is considered "by those *who plan the new additions to the
University. ” I '  ’ I

‘Pitt,’ :1 New Publication  

VVithout advance publicity, the second number of the Univer-
sity’s newest publication, the magazine Pitt, appeared on campus
Friday. The 48-page magazine presents a. personal survey of activ-
ities of the University, with most of the articles written by members
of the‘ faculty. I '

To people outside the University, it is difficult to understand
the diversity and scope of the work of teaching and rescarch.. It"
is more difficult to understand exactly how the ideals for which the
University stands are working out in actual practice.

Surprisingly live articles on subjects ranging from! the libraries
of the University to I’ittsburgh’s technological development help
to present a picture of the work that goes on at the University.
Excellent photographs by Thomas Jarrett increase the attractive-

-ness of the magazine. -

Students should see the latest issue of Pitt. It is a ﬁrst-rate

j job of interpretation of the University ’s activities.

Columnist Discusses President
Roosevelfs Thii°d Term Issue:

By “Senator” Ziskind

For seven years the United States
has experienced innumerable eco-
nomic, moral, and international
crises of overwhelming degree, and
always she has found in her chief-
executive an almost super-human
ability to master them. ’

It is repetitious, indeed, to recall
to mind his virtual lifting up, sin-

gle-handed, of a stagnant and de-"

cadent economy in 1933; of his bat-
tle for social reform waged against
an impenetrable phalanx of die-
hard money barons and misdirected
business men; of his unshakable
courage in face of a second business
collapse out of which he led the
country intact; and ﬁnally, of his
amazingly calm leadership of the
American people through a period
of war—a leadership manifestingay,
itself in a fervent effort to restore
the world to international morality.
“Political Assassination”

Of course, while in the perform-
ance of his work, he has created a
host of bitter antagonists who rel-
ish, with burning impatience, his‘
political assassination. But over-
crowding and pushing aside these
malcontents into a small numerical
minority are millions of patrotic
Americans who recognize true serv-

him in his great human enterprise.
Their numbers, as recently indicat-

Public Opinion, surpass in percent-
age the meager victory ‘extended to
Abraham Lincoln in his re-election

Road to Dictatorship?

Yet with this preponderance of
sentiment behind our_ President,
the old, ugly practice reappears of
an aggressive minority, relying on

trickery and its striking advantage ,

ernment,” or a. “national tragedy.”

Carefully timed demands are
made upon the President to an-
nounce his third term intentions
while active participants in the
work of the Republican Party join
with Southern conservative Demo-
crats to organize the candidacy of
John Nance Garner who, at pres-
ent, ranks first honor as the spokes-
man of the discredited interests of
both major political parties.

I-Iercin, then, lies a challenge to
you and to me. Are we to assume
that we can't re—elect a President
to the third term without being
called a dictator nation? Or, more
trut.hful.ly, are the charges of “dic-
tatorship” motivated more by a de-
sire to stop social progress than by
a consideration of the “dangers” to
a democracy inherent in a third
term-” ' ‘
“Tear-Dripping;”

Certainly we know that the forces
at work today deriding a third term
for the present Administration were
the very same forces that pleaded,
on bended knee, with tear-dripping‘
eyes, that Coolidge “as a. duty to
the American people must sacriﬁce
himself to his country for four
more years.” Apparently, with
these men, the main issue is: who's
going to serve the third term!

Those of us who call ourselves
liberal, who believe in a more
abundant life for the average man,
who cherish humane American
leadership of a world torn asunder
by war, will not await for Presi-
dent Roosevelt to announce his
third term intentions. We will de-
mand of him this sacriﬁce. Never,
more than now,» do we need his
healing, his calm, his civilizing in-
fluence. This is one time when we
can“: let humanity down! M

Editor, the Pitt News:

Thank you for your impartial and
unprejudiced report and editorial
review of the latest Druid “consti-
Since Druid" constitutions
are not be classed under the head-
ing of new phenomonen — having
come and gone with but slight an-
nouncement for some years—-we are
at some loss at the signal importance
attributed to our most recent ex-
periment into democracy.

You may consider this attempt on
the part’ of Druids to experiment
with self-government-incidentally,
a somewhat new word in the Druid
vocabularly-—-as rash, sophomore
blundering, or as a move to break
with our past members, or even a
move to be “exclusive.” (Your in-'
formation on this last matter is un-
fortunately entire incorrect.) In so
interpreting the Druid constitution
we feel that you have lost sight of
the real objective of campus organ-
izations. As yet the activities of
nineteen sophomore Druids affect. a
very limited circle of individuals
and our blunders, plentiful as they
may be,-are not likely to precipitate
dire results for the campus com-
munity just yet.

However, it is through such prac-
tical experience in self-expression
and self-government that we learn
-and that we advance; and if there is
any opportune moment for such ex-
by the way—-it is certainly in col-
lege.

The Druid constitution is an ex-
periment in a diﬂicult direction; our
hope is simply that our accomplish-
ments inay outweigh our blunders
and that we can accomplish that
evasive quality we call “progress.”

“LEW RILEY,

President, Druids.

Women of University Suggest
Own Plan for Improvements

By Georgia Shuset

Chancellor John G. Bowman, in
a recent interview, proposed a six
million dollar expenditure plan.
We also have a few improvements
to suggest which might prove to be
a soothing balm to the women of
the University.

May we suggest moving with
great speed to the snag—your—stock-
ing chairs which now exist in great
profusion in every room in the
buil.dir.g. New (and smooth-—like
Momma told you those boys were
at college) chairs would be very
satisfactory and a great deal less
expensive than some of the pro-
posed reforms. Besides, the League
for the Improvement of Women’s
Stockings has threatened to lower
our standing unless we make prog-
ress with those chairs.

Powder-rooms on every ﬂoor
would be helpful, too. Young men
who instigate revolutions against
shiny noses should give us their full
support in this resolution. And the

The movement reached its peak
in the second act, with Miss Heck-

pace fizzled in the first scene of
the third, ‘where 21 too drab set

Ohio State Lantern following a
visit of local players to Columbus.

AMONG OTHER THINGS that happened between December
15 and January 2 was the annual Shrine East-\V'e5t all stay foot-
ball graine, played in San. Francisco. The game, as usual, had some
signiﬁcance to Pitt followers for two Panther regulars, Dick Cas-
siano and Benny Kislgi, were on the East squad,

There were two startling d.evelo_pinents (l111'i11g‘ the galnc. In
a climate which l)I'lll.g‘S out more lyrical and extravag-a11t. Chaniber
of Coinnierce pronouncements than any Othep gegt-ion of -the 133.
tion, something went wron;_r. Despite Cass’s C];]_1‘iS‘{n1aS cards which
raved of the golden California sunshine, the skies opened up and
poured forth what the natives call a “heavy :i'og"’ for 2-4:lhours
prior to the game.

As a result, brother Cassian.o’s speed and drive were niostly
ineffectual on the slippery, “dew spattered” g-ridiron, and co-cap-
tain Kish was twice rescued by the referee  he went down" for
the third time.

The second development was a mechanical one, the East at-
tempting a play never before seen on a college ﬁeld. Somewhere
about the middle of the fourth period, the Easterne.rs came out of
their huddle, lined up, called signals, and charged acjéogg the scrim-
mage line with all four backs blocking. The \Vest was dumb-
founded.

Of course, there was a slight hitch. There was no ball—carricr.
The pass from center rolled and rolled and didn’t stop rolling
until a westerner wrapped himself around it across the goal line.
But to quote one the East ’s stalwarts, “It was potentally a great
play. Look at the surprise element.”

Letterman Get Together

THE MORE VOLUBLE MEMBER of the “Kristufel(s' in .lf’it.t”
deleg._z:at:ion, otherwise known as Joe, is ll.l.i1iil1'lg' the headlines today
as, of all tljiiiigs, an orgaiiizer. It seems that Joe and Emil Narick
and Bob Johnson and Al McKee and a few other seniors have de-
cided to form. an undergraduate varsity letterman’s club.

The idea back of it seems to be that varsity letter winners
have been in an undesirable position. They ’ve been school heroes
for a few weeks each year and then they have suddenly dropped
out of the picture until the season for their sport rolled around
again. An organization such as Joe and his boys have in mind
would make the lettermen, through the group ’s activities, a deﬁnite
part of the student body the whole year.

lt’s another step in a trend that has been more evident at Pitt
each year. lf Joe and the Uncle.rgrad11ate Varsity Lettermen’s
Club can put across to Pitt students that the varsity athlete is not
a peculiar type of individual, not.‘ a scmi-untoucliable, then we’re all
for it.

What? No Rowing Team? C
UNLESS ‘WE ARE MISTAKEN, there was a inovemcnt last

"year to produce a varsity rowing team or at least an intramural
rowing’ pi'ogra111 at the University. Purely  a. matter of con-
jecture, we Wonder what became of the plans, sketcliy as tliey were.

It inay be that the whole thing was given. up as i1npractical..
The on.l-ypactual step that was taken last year was the meeting of
Pitt, Duquesne, and Carnegie athletic officials to discuss the possi-
bilities oi:' intercollegiate rowing in Pli1i»Sl)l,lli'§—.1‘ll. ’l.‘hing's moved
splendidly until Jimmy Hagan srig_>,'g;'(és.ted that the three schools set
aside an appropriation for the sport in their budgets.

This broke up the meeting‘ and, so far as we know, nothing has
happened since.

Olson Concentrates on Folding

M an to Take Woorh‘u.ifi’s Place

By Ben Foote
With the invitational Millrose games but a rnonlli in the offing, Feb-
ruary 3, the Panther track and ﬁeld aspirants are taking daily work outs
under the xvatcliful  of Coach Carl Olson at the Pitt indoor track house.
The familiar pose by the ﬁr:-rt turn on the backstretch, 1‘l§§l1l$ watch

hand outstretched, indicates that

Selecting the mile relay team, his
most difficult task, he is concentrat-
ing on his quarter-milers. Since Pitt
has been noted for its great mile
foursome, it behooves him to hold
up its reputation despite the loss of
Long John Woodruff, anchor man
deluxe, who will Wear the colors of
the Grand Street boys club in New
York city.

From a sterling group of 440 men
Olson may ﬁnd four top-notch relay
men, but there is no Woodru.ff,in
the group. Senior Frank Ohl at his
best may help local track support-
ers forget the negro ace, but Long
John will always be rernembered
as the greatest track man the dis-
trict has produced." A

In addition to Ohl, candidates for
the team include senior veterans Al
Ferrara, and VAI McKee, juniors
Larry Tregcnning and Clyde Graf,
and sophomores Harold Stickel, Bob
Norton and Bullet Bill Carter.

Woodrufi”s departure also leaves
a gap in the half mile and mile de-
partments where he ruled supreme
in dual meets. The logical choices
for his successors in these events
appear to be Del Anderson and Al
Boulanger, respectively.

Boulanger, ICAAAA two mile
outdoor king. ran a 4:25 mile as a
freshman. If pressed into service
over the eight furlong route, he
would be a contender for “first ten”
rankings along with Cunningham,

scored four impressive Wins, and
look to be the favorites to battle it
out for the league title. Jack Glenn

driving inﬂuence of the Phi Kaps,
and provide the main scoring’ punch.

are a notch behind the leaders with
three victories and no defeats. Toth
has been the offensive spark of the
Lambda Chi team, and scored 14
points last Thursday to help his
team score a 33-22 victory over the
SAM ﬁoormen.

Fresh League

Since Dr. H. C. Carlson, bas-
ketball mentor, has “chosen” to
withdraw his two freshman bas-
ketball teams, the Zephyrs and
the Blizzards, from intramural
competition, he has changed his
interest to the development of a
freshman basketball league.

The good doctor would like to
have as large a. league as possi-
ble but at the present he has only A
enough players for two teams; He
invites any freshman who has 3

Applications should be ﬁlled’
out as soon as possible at Fallc
Clinic. Any freshman who applies
will be accepted, and the league
will be enlarged to accommodate.

the long State-Pitt basketball

Straloski put Pitt ahead 4-0 with
two side shots but State rallied to

Final Meeting

Of Semester

Dr. Gauss to Speak
At Scholars’ Meet,
Committee Reports

The January meeting of the Stu-
dent—Facu1ty Association assembly,
scheduled for tomorrow evening,
has been cancelled by the executive
committee. No further meetings of
either the assembly or the eXeCl1tiV€
committee will be held this semes-
ter, the committee decided at its
meeting on Thursday.

Dr. Christian Gauss, dean of the
college at Princeton university, will
be the main speaker at Scho1ar’s
Day this year, it was revealed. Dr.

.Gauss was invited to speak last

year, but he was unable to come to
Pittsburgh at that time. Chairman
of this year’s assembly is Robert C-

.Adams, C40.

A University contribution of
$269.37 paid for the rental Of the
hall and, the meals of the football
team and band at the SFA-spon_sor-
ed football banquet. The remain-
ider of the $586.37 spent on the ban-
quet was made up by student sales
of 317 tickets.

Spring Festival and the Senior
Ball were discussed at the meeting.
The statistics committee was in-
structed to survey student opinion
on the festival week.

Issues Volume

Eighth in a series of textbooks by
Dr. Carl J. Engelder, professor of
analytic chemistry, has been print-
ed by John Wiley and Sons, a New
York scientiﬁc publishing house.

The volume, entitled “Calcula-
tions of Quantitative Analysis” cov-
ersthe student’s problem work and
“aims to make stoichiometry, or
chemical calculations, a distinct, yet
correlated phase of the student’s
training in quantitative analysis,”
states Dr. Engelder.

Fifteen sets of problem assign-
ments designed to cover convention-
al sem-ester’s work is presented in
systematic squence. Each problem
set consists of twenty questions, ac-
companied by the necessary theory
and illustrative calculations.

women should think

Dr. Branning Urges Women
To Think for Selires in Votiitg‘ 

Is the average woman too lazy to
form her own opinion in regard to
political questions‘? is she apt to
rely upon her husband’s advice as
to the way she casts her vote?

Dr. Rosalind L. Branning, instruc-
‘lor in political science, thinks she is.

Young Dr. Branning, one of the
few women instructors in political
science in American universities,

believes that men and women alike .

should make a more intensive study
of the science of politics.

“Politics are as o-ld as civilization
itself,” she says, “but never before
has the need for a thorough under-
standing of the subject, particularly
among women, been so acute.

“It is as much a part of good cit-
izenship,” she continued, “to under-
stand the whys and wherefores of
politics as it is to vote. Women,
particularly, should make an effort
to acquaint themselves with the
facts. Too many women are prone
to vote only on the advice of others

without making any attempt to
form their own opinions.

The increase of interest in poli- 1

tics by undergraduate students be-
gan with the depression, she said,
and the war has stirred interest in
international. afir'airs. Students
bombard her with questions daily
in regard to the legality of certain
phases of the present European con-
flict.

“The average girl,” she stated, -“is
a more conscientious student than
the average boy, but men have

wider interests and usually know~

more outside facts. Mastering the
contents of a textbook does not
necessarily give one an understand-
ing of political science.”

Asked if women had any future
in diplomatic service, Dr. Branning
said that the day has not yet ar-
rived-—nor will it arrive in the near
future--when women will be as ac-
ceptable as men for diplomatic serv-
ice.

N ew Issue of ‘Pitt’ Magazine
Features University Libraries

“Pitt,” “a magazine of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh,” made its second
appearance on campus last Friday.

This issue follows up the general
policy of the initial one; it explains
campus personalities, departments,
and activities. Some very excellent
pictures help the descriptions con-
siderably.

Featured in this issue is a series 1

of articles on the various Univer_
sity libraries. The late J. Howard
Dice, formerly head librarian at the
University, wrote the general de-
scription of the reading and study-
ing facilities which precedes the
description of the individual study
rooms.

Dr. John G. Bowman, chancellor
of the University, reveals in an ar_
ticle that, in the 19 years of its plan-
ning and construction, some $8,500,-
000 has'~been spent on the Cathe-
dral, excluding the value of the
land. Dr. Bowman estimates that
$500,000 is needed to complete the
building. Dr. Bowman emphasizes
the relation of the beautiful com-
pleted Cathedral to the encourage-
ment of the student.

Agnes L. Starrett, assistant,pro-
fessor of English, is editor of the
magazine.
