The Medical Alumni Association is
about to resume -its nieetings. Plans
of a p1‘ogi‘essivc cliaractertare under
‘contemplation, The association had

.It- held four .la_rge- meetings -which
were well attended, - one large ban-
quet to Dr. Carey Vaux, who is now
Director of the De-parime-nt of Health
of the City of Pittsburgh, and two
very successful meetings at which
ﬁl-msof-a medical nature were sliown.
It_ has'al_so created a cordial entente‘
between the medical alumni, ‘and ex-
pects in the future -to strengthen the
fraternal bonds existing between all
the medical alumni.

Dr. R. J.‘ Behan; Med., "02, of the
_.Medical -Alumni Association, sends
‘the editor a.n‘a‘rticle on the campaign
to be inaugurated. in Pittsburgh No-
vember 12_ to ‘18 -by the Ainerican So-
ciety for the-. Control -of Cari:-er.
Among the enterprises‘ which have
.recentlY been noticeably thrust upon
our view and impressed into our con-
sciousness are those tor the regenera-
tiin of the down‘ and outer, the
physical.‘ and the" mental incapable
the ﬂotsam and jetsam of the human
race, which the Salvation‘ Army is
so good and kind ;to aid-,' and by its
adaptability reach and succors. V
Among the more re=:rent, but. not
least important of such agencies, is
the American Society for the Control
of Cancer. This societyiwas organ-
ized in 1913 at the instigation of
numerous. medical societies of the
country. Leading physicians and sur-
geons noticed forinany years prior:
"to? its inception, that the mortality
fromdcancer was gradually increas-
ing. Actuated by a desire to stay
this a vance and by intensive study
to devise, if possible, some means
-to counteract the advancing mortality,
the American Society was ‘organized
During the Great Warvit-s activities
were- greatly curtailed, -but since it
has entered upon an active and ener-
getic existenuoe, with the avowed pur-
pose of reducing the inroad from can-
cer upon' our ‘p'op1r‘a.tion. ' _
It is to disabuse the public of the
read of this disease‘ and to impress
upon them in unmistakable terms

he was of the opinion that this tariff
will work a very great harm on -the

interests of the United States.’

Dr. Holdsworth’s closing point was
that a businessman, in order to be
really successful, must know men and i
be able to get on with them, and that;
the time to learn to do that was while I
a young man is in college. He cited,
the in'stance’of Howard Mitten, who!
brought the Philadelphia Rapid Tran-{
sit Company from the edge of disso-Q
lution on account of insolvency to an
earn ng basis. Dr. Holdsworth said
that his one point in this talk was: *
“While in College, do not overlook
the human element.” 

Professor L. I.’ McQueen reminded
the students of the Y. M. C. A. drive
and urged them to make a. good sl1ow- :
ing for the School of Economics. {

Dean Wright told the Economics"
students that the purpose of these
meetings was to supplement the work
of the classroom with talks by prom-'

practical ﬂavor to the -work of the

“Here I found they have a building
called the VVoman's Memorial Build-

en and when one enters this place
it reminds one of a palace. They
-have the large rooms used for. meet-
ing places, receptions and such like
beautifully furnished-with period fur-
niture, oriental rugs, and so forth
and Dean Campbelltold us the girls
had lots o-f fun learning about the
proper styles of furniture. After the
convention I went down to California
and visited the University at Berke-
ley- and visited the Greek Theater
they have and was fortunate in being
there on Sunday as they have a half-
hour of good music every Sunday at
four. Later -I visited the campus of
Denver University also.”

Editor Pitt Weekly, .
Dear Sir: 

In, reply .to your editorial of last
week, permit me‘ to submit the fol-
lowing: - _ A 

Why don't the Sophomores enforce
the Freshman rules? .. Why ‘blame it
all“ on the Sophomores?‘ We-are per-‘
fectly willing to do ‘all that is required

isall ours. But we cannot do it sin-
gle-handed. By that, I do not mean
that one, S’Gph cannot do it (for -if'_h"e
cannot, ‘there is always a crowd to
back him up) but I mean that the
‘Sophomore ‘class cannot do it without
the cc~o‘pe'ra-tion of the’ Juniors -and
Seniors. Let me give you an example.
The_»other “day ‘a small group of
Sophs accosted two fellows who
looked like they might be Freshmen
Without their tell-tale Dinks.
-“Hey Frosh!” ' _ ._
“Frosh How do you git that way?”
“Oh, upper classmen. We were’ just
tryingto check up on the Freshmen.
Theymistaké was ours and_we,beg
your pardon?’ A ‘

if you know what is good for you.
You Sophs are “too blame smart.”
Now I ask you, how are the Sophs
to enforcecthe Freshmen rules, when
they have such a bunch, olf sarcastic
upper classmen to contend with. What

i harm is there in quietly,askill_g a stu-

dent for his "schedule card. If he is
an upper classman, it is ‘much easier‘
to prove it (by showing his card than
by making a great. ado about nothing
and telling the Sophs what all "they
are not. ' A ‘ ” :_

‘Juniors and ;Seniors, do/not consider
this asa “bawling out,” buttake it as

in

operation and watch the campus over-
ﬂow with Freshman dinks. 
Respectfully yours, _ '

‘ A -SOPHOMORE.

- Well,’ my cold is O. K. now.-;'and1l
am" feeling pretty good. *Yesterday. I

went to a Freshman dance andh’there‘«

was a lot of good lookin’1.co_‘-eds, they
call t_liem'_there. I asked severalrof
them _to dance but they said ‘I was too
good. for them ‘ so they preferred -’ talk.
ing to me audl told. them allabout

you‘a"d the farm. And they aslzedlnie
-how big our place was and I to‘d them

strong. They didn’t think Iwas very
bright and I asked why and one or
them says" good goods usually comes.
in small packages so I heard ‘a fellow
answer that once and I say -tolher
your nice and small and good lookin’
and you might be brigli-t-but yoii’re

too,‘ and I guess’ the way she laughed
I_,must have sprung a new one on
her,’ but it was a nice time and I got-
along allright after I showed that
smart aleck up. _

Today I had an argument with ‘a
bird who‘ says I painted twenty-sixes
all over the campus and I called him
a liar‘ and he called about twenty
soplis for protection and they gave
me bricks and oil to clean the num-

right fellowf later ‘for I saw someone
else doing it. Todayone of the profs
rsaysl ought to drop French as I was
too-dumb to" learn it and I says you
aint goin’ -to get yo_‘ur salary for noth-
ing, I paid for this stud.'y.a1_id I'm go-
ing to stay here. He laughs because I
guess he was scared to say anything
more and-hasn’t said anything since.
Its rotten the stuff profs try to-get.
away with here, butfthey can’t-get
ahead of me. .« -
Yours for study. _

The" Pitt-Penn game which was re-
fgardedearly in the season to be a_
snap for the Pa~1ither,_”l1a.s by virtue‘
of Pl:-nn’s victory over the Navy last
week by a 1,3‘ to 7 score, loomed up
as one of the- most important gridiron
classics in the eastern section. The
Panthers meett'he_ Quakers at Frank-
.lin_ Field Saturday of next week and
Warnerj has "felt secure in the belief
that Penn.-would -not be of hiucli wor-
‘fry to his Warriors, but the ﬁght and
form di'_sp1aye'.d by -Coach ’Heisman’s
gridders against, thej.N'a'vy behooves
‘Pitt to be on its guard. Tom Davies,
‘erstwhile Pitt star, is one of the back-

teges bid fair to "cause the Panther

Colonna _ Scores "Touchdown"
.De‘ciding Game in’ Final

Moments—Game. Full of
.4.’Ifhri1l's' A

-ThefPan'thers encountered more op-A
position than was expected from Buck-
nell College last Satur ay at Forbes
Field,- but managed to register-‘a' touch-'
down ﬁveﬁ minutes before the game

ended. and win out,’ 7-0, after one’ of

the most spectacular, thrilling, and
sensational contests that was ever
held in Pittsburgh.

_'l?—his victory avenged the defeats
suffered at the hands of Bucknell back
in 1912 and 1913.and also showed that
the victory, oversyracuse the preced-
ing‘ Saturday is to be followed by‘
more. _ _ ,

4 Stars in the game. were many. To
John Anderson m‘us'tgo the individual
honors. He played his usually strong‘
defenSiVe game, but it was. on the
offense that he shone most’ brilliantly.
His continual stabs off tackle were
good for ‘ﬁve to. eight yards. '-Seldom
‘was he thrown for -a loss. His" runs
through tackle were’ responsible for
most .of‘the long» marches that Pitt
made -and it was his ﬁne workthat
enabled Pitt. to stage its long proces-
sion to the Bucknell 7-yard line, from
where ‘a couple of penalties and a. few
plunges by Colonna tookthe pigskin
over the goal ‘linefor the only touch-
down of thepgame. ' . ;

' Anderson also gave an exhibition of
some sniartgfoo ball in the‘ ﬁrst quar-
ter when Bowser made ‘a bad pass
over his head. Anderson ran after the
‘ball and was followed by two Bucknel-
lians. It "was thought that'An.dy would
do the safe thing by ‘falling on the
ball, ‘but instead, he picked up the
ball and threw it forward to some un-
covered spot. This made it an incom-
plete forward pass and lost no ground
for Pitt. . ' 
severalftimes. His tackle of Butler
when the latter -was. running for a‘
touchdown was his outstanding piece
of work. "Sack on the line" played his
usual strong’ game. Few successful’
pl'a.yis were made through his position.
Heperformed his greatest bit‘ of work
in the ﬁrst quarter when Bucknell.
was on Pitt's two-yard. line. ‘Denton,
Bu<:knel1’s right halfback was attempt-
ing to hit Pitt’s right side ofthe line
on the fourth down, but Sack grabbed
“him and threw him for ‘a yard loss.

‘The march whiclf ended with Pitt
‘scoring itsutouchdown began on the
Pitt 38-yard line where Flanagan was
tackled after catching one of‘ Hen-
ning’s punts.‘ A ﬁrst down was made
on Bucknell’s "44-yard line when Pie
Williams caught a forward pass from
Flanagan. Another ﬁrst‘ down was
«made on Bucknell’s 34-yard line in two
plays. The ﬁrst play consisted of a
nine-yard run’ by Anderson and the

  InFina1Quarter,

lS'huler also rose to great heights.
