Black Action Society has had

There a 4-3 vote not to accept the
recommendations——which included
full funding for student organiza-
tion formals and the elimination of
a $1,577 Black History Month
lecture—was registered after some
board members expressed disap-
proval of funding for formals and
the cut in the BAS budget.

“I feel we have a small amount
of money to work with and I feel

subsidies received by the couples .

Posvar as he lobbyied for increased
funding for Pitt.

“Our message is simple. We’ve
said it before. . . and that is that we
are a public service institution,”
the chancellor said as he introduc-
ed his presentation. ‘

Pitt has been “overwhelmed by
inﬂation” over the past several
years, Posvar said, with the
university forced to balance off a 17
percent inﬂation rate with a 21
percent increase in tuition.

Under Gov. Richard L. Thorn-
burgh’s 1979-80 fiscal budget
package, Pennsylvania state-
owned schools stand to receive an
app.roximate 7 percent increase in
funding while state-related univer-

sities would be left with a 4.6

percent increase over funding for
the last ﬁscal year, with approxi-
mately $66 million appropriated for
Pitt.

Failure on the part of state
lawmakers to grant an increase‘
over that amount of $11.9 million
would mean Pitt must increase its
tuition once again, Posvar said.

“(State) agencies have faired . I

much better. We feel and we can
show that we need as much
consideration,” he continued.
“Our grads are in high de-
mand,” Posvar said in supporting
his case for increased funding,
saying also that Pitt trains
personnel for dealing with such
problems as the recent nuclear leak

at the Three Mile Island nuclear
plant site.

big event of the week is (their)

Kunkel, who voted to accept
allocations’ recommendations, said
at the meeting.

Particularly vocal about the BAS
budget over the interim between
March 28 and last night’s board
vote was Park, who adamantly
disapproved the elimination of the
Black History Month lecture.

But the ultimate decision last

, night was to accept the Allocations
Committee recommendation that
the lecture not be alloted for, and to
additionally trim $1,000 off a
committee $2,000 recommendation
for a Black Week lecture.

Board member Kim Watterson
said after the meeting that the

Bayard Residents Say Fraternity Problems Pitts Fault

By JEFF DUROSKO
Pitt News Staff Writer
The attack last week on Bayard
Street fraternities in a statement
presented to the state House
Appropriations Committee was not
aimed at the fraternities them-
selves, but at Pitt’s administration

r for not taking proper action in the

matter, according to a represent-
ative of a Shadyside neighbor
group.

“They (the administration) have
been "investigating the problems
since ‘1971,” said Shadyside
Neighbors for Progress represent-
ative John Brassert. “When is the
investigating going to stop and
action going to be taken?”

SNAP’s statement charged Pitt
fraternity members with ‘ “public
drunkeness, public urination and
public fornication’-’ as well as
vandalism.

“I’ve seen it and my neighbors
have seen it,” said Brassert in
reference to those acts. “No more
substantiation is needed.”

Joe Heim, president of the
Interfraternity Council said, ‘ ‘Their
claims are totally unsubstatiated
and unfounded. They could never
validate those charges.” V

Representatives from three of
the four Bayard fraternities agreed
with Heim. Mike Lopotta,
president of Delta Tau Delta called
the allegations “blatant exagger-
ations” ‘and said Jhe was “highly
annoyed that a letter so far-fetched
could make it as far as it made it.

The whole thing is highly ﬁc-
ticious.” '

Sigma Chi President Tom
Spagnol said, “Honestly, it’s
ridiculous. This is a situation that
keeps going in circles. The
neighbors are to the point now
where they won't tolerate any-
thing. They’ll do anything they can
to force the fraternities out.”

Representatives of Zeta Beta Tau
said the charges made are not true
but didn’t want to comment
further. _ A Theta Chi represent-
ative chose not to comment at all on
the situation.

One big question in the minds of
both Heim and Lopotta was exactly
who SNAP is representing

“According to Lopotta, SNAP is a

group of residents which was
originally associated with the
Shadyside Action Coalition, but
splintered off because the coalition
failed to act on the fraternityissue.

He added the letter which was
read to the House Appropriations
Committee was originally drafted
in 1977, so many of the charges are
not valid now.

“SNAP is a group of only seven
or eight people,” said Heim.
“They are a very negative group
with no positive thinking.”

Heim cited the Neighbor Re-
lations Committee, which is asso-
ciated with the IFC, as an example
of fraternities trying to work with
the neighbors.

“We tried to set up aforum with
the committee,” he said, “but they
refused.”

Brassert said there were two
important reasons for SNAP to
present the letter to the state
house.

“First, living here is absolutely
intolerable,” he said. “Also, the
university has turned a deaf ear.”

Brassert said the only action
taken by the administration in the
last two years was to tell the
residents to either call the police on
the fraternities or to move out of
the neighborhood.

“Most of us are parents, college
graduates and even former frater-
nity and sorority members and we
know that in college, a person
sometimes does some crazy
things,” he said. , “We would just
hate the idea of having to do this
through the police system.” 1 V

According to Brassert, the
university, in the last few years,
has said because of-an opinion of
the attorney general, they cannot
use the campus police in these
types of matters.

“We found out recently that no
such opinion exists,” he said.

“We are not getting down on the
fraternity ‘men, but the admin-
istration,” said Brassert, “and

they should also be down on the

administration. ’ ’

Sigma Chi’s Spagnol said he
would like to see all parties
involved, including alumni repre-
sentatives, sit down and work on
long term planning of an
alternative to housing for frater-
nities.

“There will always be problems
when fraternities are located in a
residential area, but for now the
neighbors will just have to accept

“They won’t wake up tomorrow
morning and find us gone.”

Rep. Frank Pistella, who read
the statement from SNAP, said he
acted as a spokesman for the
group, and not as a member.

“I want to make a serious effort

to meet with the university,
fraternities, SNAP and the police to

situation,” he said. “I merely

Government Agency
Studies Cost of Life

By The Associated Press
WASHINGTON—A few federal
agencies, concerned about the cost
of disease, disaster or mishaps that

«fall within their jurisdictions, have

taken to compiling dollar-estimates
of the price of life.

Most agencies take the position
that life is priceless—-or at least
that it’s practically impossible to
say what any life is worth. But a
few are wiling to make a guess.

The most finely tuned figures
come from the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration,
which has estimated that the cost of
a life lost in a motor vehicle
accident in 1975 was $287,175.

That includes $211,820 in lost
production and consumption in the
marketplace; a $63,545 loss to the
home, family and community; $275
for the hospital; $160 for doctors
and $130 for the coroner; $925 for a
funeral; $2,190 for legal expenses;
$295 for handling insurance claims,
$80 for accident investigation;
$3,685 in losses to others; $3,990 in
car damages; and $80 for delay of
traffic.

The study stressed that these
estimates “should not be inter-
preted as the value placed on a life
or as the total cost of a fata1it)§_.or
injury to society.” 

The National Center for Health
Statistics, a wing of the Depart-
ment of Health, Education and
Welfare, has estimated that a male
worker who dies in his late 20s of
cancer foregoes $274,496 in life-
time earnings. The earning
potential of a female cancer victim
in her 20s is listed at $188,384.

The center estimates the total
cost of illness in the United States
in 1975 ranged from $239 billion to
$323 billion, wich cancers account;
ing for s19 billion to $28 billion. “

Another HEW agency, the
Alcohol, Drug Abuse and Mental
Health Administration, doesn’t try
to put a value on single lives lost to
one of those causes, but it
estimates that overall, alcoholism
cost Americans $43 billion in 1975;
drug abuse cost $40 billion and

5GB Reaches Compromise on Governance Group Budgets

(Continued from page 1)
tion for BAS was too small to begin
lﬁth and that the group’s budget
did not need any more trimming.

After voting for the reduction.
the board recommended that BAS
should consult with the Pitt Union
Program Council for additional
funds for the Black Week lecture.

The board’s reconstruction of all
ﬁve budgets was the first major
compromise it has made since
convening at the beginning of
March.

And despite the cut made in

BAS’ budget, most members
appeared content with the out-
come.
‘""“‘Compromise isn't supposed to
make everyone happy. It just
makes everyone a little less
unhappy,” said board member
Cindy Dematteo.

‘Watterson commented that
funds were allocated “to the best
extent we could.

“We coldn’t reasonably give
anybody any more money,” she
said after the meeting.

Galanski, however, said he was
not pleased with compromises
made.

“It is a highly individual board
and there wasn’t agreement on
what was important during the
reconstruction (of the budgets),”
he said.

Board member Rita Cordisco
said that she would rather have
funded programming and not
funded any of the formals.

“In light of the fact of what
everybody’s stands were, all of us
made a big compromise to each
other,” she said.

State Owned School Lobb

By MARGI STUMPF
Pitt News Staff Writer

HARRISBURG—While lobbyists
for the four state-related univer-
sities—-Pitt, Penn ‘State, Lincoln
and Temple—have been pushing
over the last few weeks for a larger
slice of Gov. Richard L.Thorn-
burgh’s budget, lobbyists for the
14 state-owned universities are
satisﬁed with the $197 million
proposed for their coffers.

Anthony J. Rametta, legislative
"director (fulltime lobbyist) for the
Commonwealth Association of Stu-
dents, the official lobby for
state-owned universities, said
Monday the group is satisﬁed with
the proposed allotment.

“We're in favor of it. It’s
sufficient to avoid a tuition
increase, ’ ’ Rametta .said.

The association’s message to
state legislators ir essentially the
same as that of the Pennsylvania
Student Association of Sta’oe-Re-
lated Universities, the official lobby
for‘ state-related universities:
quality higher education at afford-
able tuition levels.

If the state-owned schools
receiveall the money proposed for
them, the term “affordable” may
apply more accurately to state-

owned institutions than to state-re-
lated.

Jeff Miller, chairman of the
Student Government Board Public/
Governmental Committee said
tuition levels at state-related
universities may be “considerably
more” than those at state-owned if
Pitt, Penn State, Lincoln and
Temple do not receive more than
the approximate $261 million
proposed for state-related univer-
sities.

A comparison of current tuition
at Pitt—$730 per term——and
California State College—$410-——al-
ready shows how state-related and
state-owned tuitions stack-up, Mil-
ler said.

But Rametta, a graduate of Pitt’s
Johnstown campus, said: “(The
state legis1ator’s) primary re-
sponsibility is to the state-owned.
Our position is that being state-
owned we should have first

. priority. In the past, we have not

had as big as increase (in
allocations) as the state-related.”

State-owned universities will
receive an approximate 7 percent
increase over last year’s allocation
if Thomburgh’s budget is approved
as it stands now, while state-
related school will get a 4.7 percent
increase.

Posvar Travels to Harrisburg For Increased Appropriations

(Continued from page 1)

tion,’’ Posvar said. “We feel it is
more beneficial to have on
comprehensive program p in one
area than two small programs.”

Several senators questioned the
validity and necessity of the tuition
credit program available to Pitt
employees, citing this program as a
major area of waste.

Pitt’s 6,000 employees are

I eligible for the tuition credit plan in

varying degrees. Full-time tech-
nicians and secretaries are entitled
to take up to six credits at a rate of
Pitt employees
earning a salary of $17,000 or over
receive unlimited free tuition for
themselves and dependents.
Several senators questioned the
number of university employees
taking advantage of the tuition
credit plan, but neither Posvar nor
Jack Freeman, vice chancellor for

planning and budget, could provide
ﬁgures.

A statement by Nathan Stark,
vice chancellor for health related
professions, criticizing Thorn-
burgh’s recommended zero percent
increase for Pitt’s medical school,
drew some ﬁery comments from at
least one senator.

Stark reiterated what was said
prior to the hearing in a letter from
Posvar to the General Assembly.

“If we receive no increase in
state funding for the School of

Medicine in ﬁscal year 1980, the

university may ﬁnd it necessary to
curtail enrollment and reduce the
university’s support of that
school,” the letter read. “This
would result in program cutbacks,
acceptance of a larger percentage
of out-of-state students and a
decline in the number of students

from families of moderate means.” ‘

“To be honest, you could take
that as a bit of retaliation and
maybe a bit of intimidation against
members of the Senate Appropria-
tions Committee,” Sen. James E.
Ross, D-Beaver County, said.

Members of PSASRU approach-
ed the issue of funding in much the
same manner as Posvar while
talking with reporters from across
the state in a special press
conference held in the Capitol
rotunda.

“The increased educational costs
being passed on to students have
an alarming detrimental impact on
enrollment from low and moderate
income families,” said Jim Morr-
ison of Pennsylvania State Univer-
sity and also state-wide president
of PSASRU.

“At Pitt, for instance, the
proportion of freshmen from
families in the $9,000 to $15,000

bracket has declined 24 percent,”
he stated.

Dave Holden, of Temple, at-
tacked Thornburgh and members
of the General Assembly for
conveying what he believed, to be
an “anti-state-related” attitude.

“The state related universities
are much more controversial than
the state owned schools are, and
because they are responsible for
constantly bringing new issues to
the people that are unsellable to
some legislators,” Holden said
following the press conference.

“Waste...this is the famous line
of the legislators,” Holden said.

“But they don't understand that a

university isn’t a bookstore or any
kind of business; it is a place to
grow and to learn, a place designed
to give students an education.”
Holden said Temple is asking for

Students registering for more
than 18 credits for the fall term
1979 will be billed “above and over
the full-time tuition rate” accord-
ing to remarks made by Associate
Provost Ray Steele at yesterdays
Student Affairs Advisory Commit-
tee meeting.

The order, issued by Provost
Rhoten Smith will affect all seven
undergraduate schools in the
university and will supercede all

{regulations laid down by the
individual schools. The mandate
will also affect graduate programs
in which students will be permitted
to register for no more than 15
credits without special permission

and paying the extra fees.

members. of Smith's staff became
suspicious of students registering
for as many as 25 credits in one
term.

It was discovered many of these
students either dropped a major

portion of these credits or secured a
G grade (incomplete) from their
instructor.

If they opted to receive a G
grade, they would not register for
the next term but instead complete
the work for the courses taken the
In the end they
would receive enough credits to be
considered a full-time student for
two terms but would pay for only
one term.

Undergraduates will be permit-
ted to register for any number of
credits providing they obtain
special permission from their
respective dean. Such permission
will only be granted after careful
examination of the student’s
transcript and intention in taking
the overload of credits.

“There is a need for closer
academic advising,” Steele said.
‘-‘If student X did not do very well
with 17 credits one term and wants
to take 20 credits the next term,
there should be some system of
checks.”

Bernie Popko, president of the
Engineering Student Cabinet
charged the move as being
discriminatory against Engineers,
some of whom are required to take
135 credits and must take an
overload of credits.

Steele answered Popko’s claims
by saying the engineering program
is constructed to allow Engineers to
get the required number of credits
without carrying an excessive
number of overload terms.

In other business concerning
registration, Popko also leveled
charges against the registrars
office that the lines are long and
time consuming for students.

These charges were answered by
Registrar Frank Reed who outlined
some of the duties and stumbling
blocks encountered by his office.

According to Reed, the registrars
office is responsible for scheduling
students for more than 7,000

undergraduate and graduate cour-
ses. It handles 80,000 Course

Residence Life Inspects Dorms

To Determine Room Damages

By TERESA SOKOL
Pitt News Staff Writer

For the first time ever, rooms in
each Pitt dormitory were inspected
this year, according to Jo Ann
Gibbs, assistant director of the
Office of Residence Life.

“It's easier to deal with damages
when people are here; it avoids the
hassle,” she said.

Gibbs said the goal of room
inspections was to assess clearly
visible and large damage and

‘I stressed that in no way was this a
search.

She pointed out that the housing
contract allows for such inspections
and said she felt it is good for
students to know dorms are being
inspected for damages.

Room inspection teams consisted
of members of the dorm’s hall
council, housing staff and ORL.
The teams, which usually consisted
of three people, Eould share
opinions of any damage found,
Gibbs said.

Bills for damages can be given
only after determining who is
responsible and when and why
such damage occurred, she said.

Although the results of the
inspection are pending, inspection
teams were looking for obvious
damage, cleanliness and I health

rooms. Also, the teams looked for

“There are some unusual in-
stances,” she said, “where stu-
dents have decided to reconstruct
their rooms by putting fists and
chairs through walls.”

Semi-public damages, such as
damage to security doors, cost the
university about $22,000 last year,
according to Donovan Hughes,
director of housing. Total
estimates for private damage are
not readily available, he said.

“The Judicial Board had
ruled fines are not applicable for
room inspections, but restitution

In addition, it processes classes for
202 classrooms and sets up
residence standards for every
student attending Pitt.

“As far as registration goes we
are at the fancy of every advisor
and student,” Reed said. “If an
advisor decided to schedule ap-
pointments for 200 students at one
particular time, we are going to
have 200 students all coming to the
registrars office at the same time.”

Popko asked why there is no way
for the registrars office to keep
track of the number of add-drops
from closed class sections. He
added that many times classes
thought to have been closed are
not because of students who decide
to add-drop at the beginning of the
term.

Reed said the only way this could
be done would be by instituting an
“on-line” system of registration, in
which students would come directly

to the registrars office where their
registration would by typed into
a computer terminal. use of this
method would eliminate the use of
advisors to register.

“The only thing missing right
now for an ‘on-line’ system is the
hardware and the programming,”
Reed said, not making any
predictions about when such a
system could conceivably be
instituted. “The only thing is that
we go to this type of system and
bypass all the checks made on
students advisors, we have to ask if
all students are going to be able to
handle themselves.”

Reed said from his observations
of the registration lines, most
students have not been made to
wait more than 15-20 minutes
during the last several terms.

“As good as you say the current
system might be,” Popko said.
“It is not unusual for an Engineer
to spend an entire morning
registering for classes. '

Pitt Plays Host to City - Wide Special Olympic Games

By TERESA SOKOL
Pitt News Staff Writer

“Come on Leonard, you can do
it!-”

Parents and family cheered and
ﬂashes went off, as the competitors
rounded a turn in the track. It was
the three-legged race, an auxiliary
event in the Special Olympics, held
yesterday at Pitt’s Fitzgerald
Fieldhouse and Trees Hall.

“You can see it in the faces of
the athletes and their parents—the
smiles and 1aughter—-for many it’s
the only time they will have a
chance to compete,” said Warren
D. Sipp). director of the Special
Olympics.

athletic events designed for ex-

Special Olympic programs have
been successful across the nation.

“I am pleased the University is
involved with this worthwhile
program,” Sipp said.

The competition is set up‘ on
local, area, state, and national
levels.

“The meet this year is a local
one—the first step in the competi-
tive process. Pitt has been
involved for a number of years. In
fact, this is the third annual local
meet here,” Sipp said.

Local meet winners will advance
to the area meet at Baldwin-
Whitehall High School in May.

The 78 competitors present were ,

divided by age, from’ eight years to
adult, for the events.

“Because there is a wide gap in
the number of participants over 30
years of age, they are grouped
together. So we may have adults

over 60 competing with younger,

athletes. And they’ll give their
best like the eight year olds will,”
Sipp said.

Competitors in the local meet
come from six area programs,
including Marcy Hospital, Camp

Final
Farewell
to Seniors

Column

There is nothing as disgusting as graduating
seniors. They have the extremely disgusting habit of
gloating about their last days at Pitt, relentlessly
reminding less fortunate underclassmen that their
last final exam as an undergraduate is only a few days
away.

Despite the unintentional envy they arouse,'we still
wish them good luck. Anyone with the perseverance
to stick to it and graduate after at least four years of
the daily grind of study and classes more than deser-
ves it; the hassles that life at this large, urban mon-
strosity heaps upon us unmercifully sometimes seems
enough to drive anyone to the brink of frustration
and despair. "

Every senior has a personal horror story to tell. If
it is not a case_of scheduling misfortunes, they have
probably had to face the loneliness of a freshman lost
in the big city or the inevitable ordeal of a long line in
the bookstore, student accounts or the registrar’s of-
fice. The headaches may be unbearable at the time
but they soon melt into unimportance in the face of
the joys that life at Pitt inevitably brings.

First is the greatest reward of all, friendship. The
close ties built between classmates and roommates
are often strong enough to last long after graduation
is passed. College offers what is perhaps the last time
for many to build the deep commitment of friend-
ship, not just the fleeting ties of neighbor and
acquaintance that develop in the suburban develop-
ments and apartment complexes of our mobile
society.

If we are fortunate, thechance for love is here too.
The cynics may sneer, but love can be the most im-
portant experience of college. Nothing but this ser-
ves as well to teach two people about themselves and
about others, and goes a long way in helping them to
learn both self-respect and mutual respect.

The frustrations of college life even become fondly

remembered accomplishments in retrospect. Long
nights spent slaving over books and endless hours of
workufor some cherished activity for which students
receive too little or no recognition becomes valuable
when viewed from the future. When the work is
over, graduates can look back on._the hours of labor
and see that they have proved to their peers and
professors, and more importantly to themselves,
their ability to achieve their goals and excell.

To graduates with this sense of accomplishment in
their minds, we wish good luck. We hope your ex-
periences in the real world beyond this university are
happy ones and that the world has a niche and a job<
for you.
broadened by your study at Pitt and include more
than the desire for a job and middle class complacen-
cy. We urge the graduating class of 179 to look
beyond the narrow concerns of financial security and
fight the attitude of apathy rampant in the late 1970s.
In the end, the battle against complacency will
benefit not only the class of 1979 but the legions of
graduates to follow in the years to come.

False Beliefs Roadblock to Better Mexican Relations

We also hope your horizons have been A

By ROD GRIFFITH

Assistant Secretary of State
Viron Vaky agreed that better
understanding of Mexico is needed
in the United States. In answer to
Jorge Bustamente’s comments on
the ignorance concerning the
benefits of Mexican migrant
workers to the U.S. economy, Vaky

said American misconceptions
about the issue are disappointing.
“It is discouragingto read in The

»New York Times the chivalrous
statements on Mexican immigra-.

tion that have come for quite
sometime without further analy-
sis.” said Vaky.

Bustamente and other speakers

at the forum on relations between‘

the United States and Mexico made
some convincing arguments refut-
ing the age old myths about the
effect of illegal Mexican immi-
grants on the U.S. economy.
Bustamente especially presented a
long list of facts on undoucmented
immigrants that showed the notion
of immigrant workers as a

detriment and burden on American
culture to be far from the truth.

In his remarks, Bustamente
stressed the “factual dimension”
of views on immigrants that
debunked the traditional beliefs of
the “perceived dimension” of
views held by the American public
and promulgated by the news
media in this country.

“In the factual dimension, there

is an encouraging degree of.

concensus that the problem can be
conceived within the concept of the
international labor market,” the
scholar from El Colegio de Mexico
commented. “There are factors on
both sides of the border for the
situation—on the United States
side the demand for cheap labor
and on the Mexican side an
economy of underdevelopment. ’ ’

Bustamente pointed out the
benefits of this cheap labor. Since
the U.S. population is shrinking in
size, the labor force in this country
will not be able to underwrite the
social security payments for the
baby boom generation when it
retires in the coming decades. The
migrant work force, which remains
in this country only temporarily but
still pays income taxes and social
security payments, would supply
the funds the federal government
needs to pay the baby boom
generation-—the retirement funds

due it under the Social Security
Act.

Despite the proof that Mexican
immigrants actually beneﬁt the
U.S. economy,-Wayne Cornelius of A
the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, points out that the
Carter administration has done
little to defuse the sentiment that
believes the undocumented immi-
grants from Mexico and the
Caribbean nations are a burden on
this country. He has special dislike
for the stands of Secretary of Labor
Ray Marshall, who has said in the
past that stringent control of
immigration is needed.

“Except for one statement by
Attorney General. Griffin Bell on
‘Face the Nation’ there has been no
statement by any administration
official that Mexican immigrants
are playing a useful and beneficial
role in our country,” said Corneli-
us.

.Both Bustamente and Cornelius
pointed out the reason why
politicians have made no strong
stand in defense of Mexican
immigrants. The Mexican immi-
grants cannot vote but labor and
her voting blocks in this country
see immigrants as a threat, so
defense of illegal immigrants
would be political suicide.

Bustamente recalled one conver-
sation with a congressman who

False Notions on Mexican Immigrants Age Old Bias

(Continued from page 8)
admitted that what the Mexican
scholar said was very convincing
but said he would lose his next
election if he dared to advocate
liberalization of immigration laws
to allow more Mexicans and others
into the United States.

Immigrants have always been
the scapegoat of America’s ills.
From the Know Nothing Party to
the Ku Klux Klan to the John Birch
Society, there has been a long
history of anti-immigrant bias in

rightist politics in this country.
This bias has seeped into the major
political parties during times of
economic crisis.

This bias in American politics
has tinged government policy on
immigrants, set by the labor
Department and the Justice De-
partment, and those departments
have shown little sympathy for the
idea that immigration could be
good for the United States.
Somehow the antiquated notion
that foreign-speaking immigrants

could pollute the Anglo-Saxon
culture of this country has
managed to ﬁnd a home in the
strict immigration controls set by
these two departments.

The State Department, the one
administrative branch that might
show more sensible views on the
immigration issue, has little input
into the policies on immigrants.
Until the State Department has
more affect on these policies, there
is little hope for a_policy that would

admit to the beneﬁts of immigra-
tion to the United States.
Cornelius sees oil discoveries in
northern Mexico in recent years as
a sign of hope for a more realistic
immigration policy toward our
southern neighbor. Immigration is
one of the sore points between
Mexico and the United States and
must be solved to the Mexican
government’s satisfaction, if the
United States hopes to get badly
neede oil supplies from Mexico.
Hopefully, the Carter admini-

stration will recognize the need for
more enlightened ideas about
Mexican immigration and attempt
to liberalize the present immigra-
tion laws. If it does not, the
reaction of labor and other special
interests, who will luse Mexican
immigrants as a scapegoat for
American economic problems, is
probable. When better relations
that could beneﬁt the United States
are at stake, leveler heads than
those who echo the ancient claims
of the Know Nothings must prevail.

letters have preceeded this one in
criticizing this newspaper; I find far
more fault with those who would,
criticize than I do with those who

attempt to produce a newspaper at

Pitt. Either these recent critics are
idiots or they know not of that
which they criticize.

Most letters were written by
students involved with student
organizations. They are concerned
with public relations, in large part,
and have little idea of how

journalism and public relations
differ.

It is difficult to produce a
newspaper; thatonly a handful of
fine newspapers exist today should
be proof that journalism is not an
easy ﬁeld. The Pitt News faces
every problem any other news-
paper would find and also must
contend with a number of
additional obstacles placed before
it by the university.

These obstacles are many and
formidable, especially to a small
staff that receives nothing but
headaches from Pitt. The school
has no journalism department and

its lone outstanding professor of
non-ﬁction writing (Lee Gutkind)
taught no classes this year. The
university’s accounting and other
financial procedures are not geared
to handle the problems of a
newspaper and the continual threat
of creeping censorship is enough to
‘keep any editor busy.

I'm aware of this because I
became editor of The Pitt News
during my sophomore year. A
barrage of 5 a.m. deadlines, an
overworked and undertrained staff,
Pitt News-induced problems at
school and a general sense of
helplessness at the newspaper

made me an ex-editor before my
junior year reached its midpoint.

I screamed about Pitt News
quality more than did most when I
was editor and my screaming still
has not ended. But I continue to
ﬁnd it difficult to aim my anger at
those students crazy, creative and
dedicated enough to endure life at

The Pitt News. It is not a typical.

student organization—it requires
real work and skill to produce a
newspaper and The Pitt News must
earn every cent it spends. In these
areas it probably is unique among
student-run concerns.

Anyone wishing constructively to

criticize The Pitt News would do
well to learn the nature of the
paper’s problems and any work
toward erasing those obstacles
would be appreciated by those who
have attempted to scale them in the
past.

But, words cannot express (at
least not here) my distaste toward
those who would ﬁre blindly and
publicly at The Pitt News armed
only with ignorance, selﬁshness
and malice. ‘

Love Conquerer Attack on Religious Broadcasts

As time goes on, the personality
of our homeland, America, chan-
ges. Yesterday, it was but a large
frontier to be conquered by a

yzstrong-willed people with a desire
to make it a fruitful “Eden.” it was
such a paradise where freedoms
reigned and prosperity covered the
land. Today, as man increases in
abundance, it seems as though he
is sacriﬁcing a great deal.

Is there no thankfulness being

given to God for what he has
received, most especially his very
own life? Does he feel he is the
most supreme being
universe? And what is he doing
with the freedoms his forefathers
worked so very hard to lay claim to?
It is said that change is a sign of
growth—a reevaluation of how to
better something. And yet this is
not necessarily true for all things.

To me this possible implementa-

April Weather Finally Sp

Pih‘ Grounds Upkeep
Takes Constant Effort

By MARK N. MATICH

It’s spring again, and the
forsythia around campus are
coming into bloom. This sight
might stir a Pitt student into
thoughts of summer and days of
’ leisure but nothing could be further
from the minds of Ken Soergel,
University supervisor of gardening
and landscaping, and his crew of
29.

Working on an operating budget
of about $250,000 annually, Soergel
and his men tend the .85 acres of
the Pitt campus year round. ,

The main priority of the
landscapers is maintainance of the
grounds; mowing the lawns,
pruning the trees and planting new
shrubs‘ and ﬂowers. No new
projects will be started this spring
due to a tight budget, but an oak
tree will be planted on the
Cathedral lawn, dedicated to Dr.
William Pannetta, classics profes-
/sor.

In addition to the oaks, gums and
maples that line the Cathedral’s
lawns, Soergel pays particular
interest to two redwoods; one near
Heinz Chapel, the other next to the
Stephen Foster Memorial.

“The redwoods are a dwarf
species and are really a novelty to
the Pittsburgh area,” said Soergel.

“Still, not too many people know

 

Photos by Cindi ”Ei/angelisfa

we have them. Both are at least 25
years old and healthy.”

Soergel has held his position at
Pitt for ten years now and in that
time he has seen his budget
increase by only 25 percent.
“When I came here 10 years ago I
had a budget of about $197,000 a
year, he said. “Since that time,
though, salaries have gone up and
this has taken up just about all of
the budget increases, so things
haven’t changed that much since
I’ve been here.”

The majority of Soergel’s budget
today goes to salaries, which ran
$207,000 this year alone. A large
portion of this is paid out to
workers to come out in the winter
months for "snow removal. “I
ﬁgure that it will cost me close to a
quarter of my budget in salaries
and equipment for this past
winter,” Soergel estimated.

One utility vehicle which brushes
and blows away the snow costs
$7,000. Soergel is alloted $10,000
this year for new equipment and is
purchasing one such vehicle this
spring, so he has little left with
which to work.

“My only complaint with this
year’s budget is that there are not
enough funds for new equipment,”
he said. “I’m working with seven
Ford Broncos that are nine years

End Of Term Signals Begining ’ Of Summer ‘79

By MARK HOLAN

The Summer of '79. What will it mean to
you?

For most students, it means a long,
sunny break from books, classes and
exams. This alone issufﬁcient cause for

celebration to people now in the process

of sweating out Finals.

But there’s more; much much more to
summer.

In another few weeks swimming pools,
parks, basketball and tennis courts will be

open -to the public. People anxious to
limber up neglected muscles will be able
to do so by splashing, jogging, walking
and playing.

For those who missed its opening last
summer, the new wave pool at South Park
could provide a_day’s excercise and fun.

Summer’s number one sport, /baseball,
has already begun. A sharp eye should be
kept for special ball park events and with
the price of 6,000 reserved seats reduced
from, $4.25 to $3.25 there's no reason

anyone should miss seeing a Buc home
game. ' _
Harness racing at the Meadows now
features a computerized betting system
that speeds up lines and makes it possible
for all bets to be made on one card.
And football fans can spend the last
weeks of August enjoying the sun and
watching the Steelers work out at their
training camp in St. Vincent. '
Summer is also a time for concerts. Led
Zeppelin,»The Who, Fleetwood Mac and
Emerson, Lake and Palmer are some of

Riverboats are a famllar summer scene on Pittsburgh’s three rivers.

51st Annual Academy Awards

the super groups tenatively scheduled to
make U.S. tours this summer and would
all be likely candidates for an outdoor
show at Three Rivers Stadium.
Concerts already scheduled include:
Gino Vanelli at the Civic Arena April 25,
The Tubes, April 26 at the Stanley
Theater, Keith Richard and Ron‘ Wood
May 2, Cheap Trick May 6 and Van Halen

May 7, all at the Stanley, and Supertramp 

June 4, also at the Stanley.

In addition to the big shows, small
outdoor concerts featuring local bands of
various musical styles are sponsored by
the Pittsburgh Department of Parks and
Recreation. These shows usually occur at
lunch time and can be seen in Mellon
Square, Market Square or at Point State
Park.

Summer is also a time for movies,
especially drive-in movies. As the
weather begins to warm, the gravel
“passion pits” will fill with cars, trucks
and vans. Old favorites and new releases
will soon be showing on the giant screens.

The best part of summer, however, is
the special events. Many are still in the
planning stage, but here are some things
to look for: theShrine Circus will be at
the Civic Arena May 15 through19, the
Three Rivers Arts Festival will be held at
the end of May, the traditional Fourth of
July celebration at Point Park, and the
second Three Rivers Regetta will be held
sometime at the beginning of August.

Also held in the summer is the Ethnic
Food Festival and Boat Show at the Civic
Arena and the Shadyside Art Festival.

These are only a few of the many
events to look forward to in the Summer
of’ 79. Add to this list personal events like
picnics and vacations and you've got a full
summer of activity. There’s only one
problem. After the Labor Day weekend,
most people discover that they haven’t
done half the things they ‘wanted to, or
could have done in the good ole summer
time.

‘Dear Hunter’ And ‘Coming Home’ Top Honors

By PATTY TASCARELLA

There were some surprises at the 51st
annual Academy Award presentations
Monday night: Warren Beatty, nom-
inated for an unprecedented four awards,
took home none and his ﬁlm “Heaven
Can Wait,” which most oddsmakers and
Hollywood insiders predicted as a sure
bet for aclean sweep of most of the major
categories failed to claim a single Oscar.

Instead, the awards were fairly evenly
distributed between Michael Cimino’s
“The Deer Hunter” and Hal Ashby’s
“Coming Home.”

“The Deer Hunter” was voted best

Picture. Over “Heaven Can Wait,”
“Coming Home,” “An Unmarried

_Woman” and “Midnight Express.”

Christopher Walken recieved the nod for
Best Supporting Actor, Cimino was
awarded Best Director.

Best Actor and Actress went to “Coming
Home" costars Jane Fonda and Jon
Voight. Fonda, a previous winner for
“Klute” and a four time nominee, made
a long and emotional acceptance speech,
partially delivered in sign language.
Voight, a loser in his category ten years

ago for “Midnight Cowboy,” gave an
eloquent and gracious talk, praising the
efforts of fellow nominees and stating he
was still overcome by a film clip tribute
to Sir Lawrence Olivier, recipient of a
special honorary Oscar.

The clips, introduced by Cary Grant,
included footage from some of Oliver's
greatest roles: “The Entertainer,”
“Wuthering Heights,” “Rebecca,”
“Henry V,” “Hamlet” and “Richard
III.”

Maggie Smith was awarded Best
Supporting Actress for “California
Suite,” Best Screenplay went to
“Midnight Express” and “Coming
Home” and Best Cinematography to
“Days of Heaven.” “Superman” was
awarded a special Oscar for the special
effects.

“Last Dance,” from “Thank God It’s
Friday” was voted Best Song and
“Midnight Express” was cited for Best
Musical Score.

“Death on the Nile” was awarded Best
Costumes.

The highlights of the three and a half
hour extravaganza? Shirley MacLaine,
pausing before presenting the award for
Best Actress to say “I’ve got to say how

proud I am of my baby brother, Warren,”
Donna Summer's fine interpretation of
“Last Dance” (each nominated song was
sung by the artist who recorded it
originally for the production—an Oscar
first) and a very poignant moment when
John Wayne, appearing quite‘ shriveled
and aged from a near-fatal coronary,
walked onstage to present the award for
Best Picture.

Wayne is synonymous with traditional
Hollywood and it would have seemed

ironic, in other circumstances, for him to
be reading off the capsule descriptions of
each nominated ﬁlm—two dealing with
the horrors of Vietnam and another
focused on a drug smuggler’s experience
in a Turkish prison. But Wayne was not
the blustering rightwinger that night, he
was as much a cherished symbol as
Olivier, and the fact that the awards went
to films because of ‘their merits, not
politcs, continues a welcome step towards
new traditions.

Machito, lrakere Help Bring Latin Sound To Area

By GARY BRADFORD

Machito
Pitt Student Union

Salsa, bossa nova, -Afro-Cuban. What-
ever name it’s called, Latin music-a
combination of African and Carribean
rhythms and religion,’ Spanish folk music
and American popular music——is a
vibrant, inventive idiom. \
.Unfortuna'tely, Pittsburgh has a minut
Latin community, so pure New York-
based salsa is practically unknown here.

A The now defunct Flo’s on Bouquet St. was

the only outlet in the city for Latin
events, however,

The legendary Machito appeared last

p w Friday in the Pitt Student Union, courtesy
. ‘ of. the Center for Latin American Studies,

and Columbia Records released an
album by Irakere, the first Cuban group
to record and tour in the U.S. since Castro
came to power. They appeared. in
Pittsburgh last month as the opening act
for Stephen Stills

Singer-maraccas player Machito left
Cuba about forty years ago and has been
leading groups ever since. His original
big lgand, The Afro-Cubans, was in the
early 1940s the first Latin group to
integrate the traditional music with
American jazz. This was due mainly to
the group’s musical director, Mario

Bauza, who had played trumpet in the
swing bands of Cab Calloway and Chick
Web-b. In the late ’40s and ’50s, the

Afro-Cubans recorded with jazzmen like.

Charlie Parker,» Buddy
Cannonball Adderly.

At his Pitt concert, instead of a big band,
Machito fronted a ‘conjunto’, (or combo)
consisting of piano, bass, guitar, trumpet
and percussion. The group presented a
lecture-demonstration on the evolution of
Afro-Cuban music. a

One of the percussionists explained each
drum rhythm and its relationship to

Rich and

Nigerian and" Dahomeyan Yoruba re-

ligions. The conga-bongo rhythms grew
more complex as they progressed from
Africa_to‘Cuba. Eventually the full group

played some spirited. dance music, and A

several -audience members got up and

. tried a variety of mambos, cha-chas and .\

original steps. .

In between numbers, Machito joked
about his nearly incomprehensible
accent. It didn’t matter once he started
singing. In Latin music, the solo vocalist
sets the pace with vocal ‘inspiraciones’
(improvisations) and Machito is a master
of this, especially during montuno
sections. (A montuno is' a two- or
three-chord pattern repeated behind
vocal or instrumental inspiraciones.)
Latin bands generally generate plenty of
heat in a montuno, through intricate
polyrhythms set against insistent guajeos
and tumaos—rhythmic and melodic

'3 exchanges from the piano and bass.

‘”Machito’s band is one of the best
‘examples of traditional Afro-Cuban style,
while lrakere fuses the traditional with
rock» and free jazz. They play some of the
strongest Latin music since early
Santana.

Irakere’s album, titled “lrakere,”,was
recorded at last year’s Newport and
Montreaux Jazz Festivals. Pianist Chuco
Valdes is the main arranger-composer,,
but the tunes ‘are so loose they seem
improvised from scratch.

*“Misa Negra” is the most structured
number, but still allows for time and
rhythm changes to occur at will. Here, as

on the other tracks, the percussionists -

play_ a variety of drums and hand-held
instrumentm creating an irresistablewall
of sound. The coros (vocal call-and-
response chants-) are as exciting as the

percussion work. Irakere is a multi-level .

band, running the gamut from Yoruba
war chants to danzons, to hard rock.

Machito and lrakere are water for a
salsa-thirsty Pittsburgh. Since the demise
of Flo’s the music is rare, but there is
some material available.

Some of this includes a two-record
orchestra on Savoy Records"; Santana
albums, the first three especially; The
Fania All-Stars, an assemblage of the
Fania label’s biggest names like Willie
Colon and Johnny Pacheco, but these
recordings are;very commercialized
Latin, aiming for the disco market; and

Machito
ﬁnally, _Mogo Santmaria’s early ’60s
albums (which were commercialized for
that era’s soul market).

But for the most part, Latin music
available to Pittsburghers is Desi Arnez
wailing “Babalu” on the 600th rerun of
‘‘I Love Lucy.”

Among the many upcoming stage and
screen productions coming to the area,
two may prove of special interest to the
entertainment seeker.

The hit Broadway musical “The Wiz”
will be returning to Pittsburgh for four
shows at Heinz Hall April I 7 through the
19th. And “Dawn of the Dead,” a sequel
to George Romero’s “Night of the Living
Dead,” is scheduled to open at area
theaters this Friday.

“The Wiz,” which sold out Heinz Hall
during an August-September engage-
ment, is already surpassing many musical
theater shows (“Funny Girl,” “Cam-
elot,” and ‘‘Oliver’’) in total nation-wide
performances. It has won seven Tony
Awards including Best Musical, Best
Score, Best Director, Best Choreography,
Best Supporting Actor, Best’Supporting
Actress and Best Costume Designs.

“The Wiz” has also won a Grammy
Award for Best Cast Show Album.

“Dawn of the Dead,” unlike its
predecessor, a low-budget, black-and-
white ﬁlm, will be in technicolor and in
stereophonic sound. The sequel comes
nearly ten years after the release of
Romero’s original horror-adventure flick.

Voight Ranks With The Best In ‘The Champ’ p

By FORREST BUFFENMYER

The Champ
Directed by Franco Zefferelli
United Artists

Jon Voight is proving to be quite the
actor, and is starting to join the ranks of
peers Robert Redford, Robert De Niro, Al

_\ Pacino and Jack Nicholson. -

After excellent performances in
“Coming Home” and “Deliverance,”
Voight repeats in “The Champ.” In this
film Voight plays Billy Flynn, an
ex-champion boxer who now trains
horses.

This ﬁlm boasts a cast of good stars,
including Faye Dunaway, Arthur Hill and
Jack Warden.

Dunaway portrays Annie, the ex-wife
of Billy Flynn. Seven years ago he
divorced her, for reasons not altogether

made clear in the ﬁlm, and also got
custody of T.J., a heart-warming
eight-year-old played expertly by Ricky
Schroeder.

The problems arise when Annie

accidently meets T.J. at a racetrack.
Later, she sees Billy, and the proverbial
monkey wrench gets thrown in the
machinery. '

The ﬁlm gets its name from T.J.’s
nickname for his father. However, Billy
proves to not be such a “champ” when it
comes to raising T.J. He gambles, drinks
heavily, and is generally irresponsible.
He chooses to run from his problems,
most of which he creates, and will not
face them. Still, the boy truly loves him,
and the two are reasonably happy in
their own little world.

Enter Annie, who now wants to see her
son. Various complications arise, owing

.Billy’s part.

partially to bitterness and jealousy on
These complications
eventually sweep up Billy and lead to his
doom.‘ -

Dunaway is ethereal in this ﬁlm, she
seems to radiate light. Her role and lines
are at times cliche and wooden, and a
lesser actress might succumb. But
Dunaway manages to keep her part aloft.

As T.J., Schroeder is a boy genius. His
eight-year-old-going-on-thirty attitude
consistently helps to move the story
along. His devotion to his father is
intense, and the saddest and most
heart-rending scenes are those when
Billy proves to be only human.

Warden’s role is a familiar one-—as
Billy’s trainer he nearly carbon-copies his
role in “Heaven Can Wait.” His
performance throughout the ﬁlm is
strong, but is a bit worn and boring after
“Heaven Can Wait.”

The sad surprise is Hill, an
accomplished actor in his own right. He
has no real part here, but merely sits
around his expensive yacht and plays the
rich but passive husband (Mike Phillips)
of Annie.

Director Franco Zefferelli has certainly
chosen a good location for this drama in
picking southern Florida. The scenery
here is breathtaking and Zefferelli offers
as much of this awesome scenery as can
be imagined.

Unfortunately, the work he has recently
gained fame for, the TV-movie “Jesus of
Nazareth,” far outshines this ﬁlm. He
does, however, build tension well and
establishes good conflict. He resolves
both of these excellently.

At many points this movie just doesn’t

cut it. But it is above average, and the
cast makes it that.

Eric W00d,
Robin Russel
At Coffeehouse

By MICHAEL McCABE

Eric Wood and Robin Russell
Lair Coffeehouse
Student Union Lower Lounge

The PUPC holds its Lair Coffeehouse
on the first Saturday of each month.
Professional and student musicians are
featured. the atmosphere is loose and
relaxing. Beverages and , snacks i are
provided in addition to the entertainment.

This month the Lair presented Eric
Wood and Robin Russell, preceded by
three student performances.

Wood plays guitar and sings in a
folk—rock style. He writes all of his own
material and his lyrics involve a lot of
thinking, something unusual these days.
He has recorded three albums but has
been unable as yet to get anything
released. He is reluctant to compromise
his music in order to sell it.

Performing is very important for him.
He gets a great deal of satisfaction from
communicating with an audience. One of
Wood’s songs talk about the future, and
for the future of music itself he sees a
general trend toward simpler, more
acoustic sounds.

Russell, who plays piano and sings, has
much in common with Wood.

She also uses all her own material.
Though her songs deal more with topics
of romance, they have the same probing
quality that Wood’s do.

The two have recently begun perfor-
ming together and also plan to do some
writing together. On Friday night, before
appearing at the Lair, they opened
Phoebe Snow’s concert at Duquesne
University.

The Lair’s student performances are
selected through auditions. It isn't ne-
cessary to be a student, and anyone may
audition. The performances that were
presented Saturday were chosen from ap-

proximately twenty that were auditioned.

Bill Pasco opened, playing guitar and
singing. He did some original numbers
and some better known songs including a
tune written by Harry Chapin. Next came
Mildred Jackson, singing, and Jeffry
Martin, playing piano and singing. They

Parliament

Parliament/Funkadelic
Civic Arena

When Parliament/Funkadelic come to
town there’s no telling how the show will
come out. Last year they came with a

watered down version of their world —

famous show. This fall, the Brides of
Funkenstein and Funkadelic gave an

absolutely fantastic show at the Stanley-

Theater.
Monday night Parliament/Funkadelic

came into the Civic Arena with a three ~

part show that blew out the audience.
The ﬁrst act was the gorgeous Brides of
Funkenstein who warmed up the rather
dead audience. ,
Funkadelic, the second act, was the
most musical of the three. Their ﬁrst
number, “Cosmic Stop,” was highlighted
by very dynamic guitar work by Gary
Shirler and Michael Hampton.
Funkadelic’s show also featured a
ﬁfteen minute solo stretch on “The
Undisco Kid” with Rodney “Skeet”
Curtis on bass, Bernie Worrell on
keyboards and Jerome Baily‘ with
Fratangelo on an interesting percussion
duo. The group ended their part of the
show with Worrell giving a ﬁve minute
prelude into “Maggot Brain” which was
highlighted by Eddie Hazel’s beautiful
song length guitar solo.
When Parliament hit the stage the crowd
ﬁnally came to life. The stage was
suddenly annointed with underwater
paraphernalia. “Aqua Boogie,” “One
Nation Under A Groove,” "Flashlight”

and “Mothership Connection” were‘

highlights of the show.

The only thing that’s wrong with a
Parliament/ F unkadelic show is you never
seem to get enough. The concert was
deﬁnitely worth the money and Par-
liament, once again, made their fans

happy.

Yes Returns To Arena

By MARK HOLAN

After a two year absence, England’s
legendary Yes returns to Pittsburgh
tonight for an 8 p.m. solo show at the
Civic Arena. This will be the band’s sixth
appearance in town.

Pittsburgh is the third stop on Yes’
current North American tour which began
Monday in Kalamazoo, Michigan. The
tour will last 11 weeks, ending June 21
with the ﬁnal performance scheduled for
the Spectrum in Philadelphia.

All together, Yes will play 45 dates in 40
US. and Canadian cities.

Renowned. for their extravagant and
well-produced stage shows, Yes will

- feature something which has never been

seen in Pittsburgh before—-a circular,
rotation stage which will be set at center
ice.

All lighting and sound will be suspended
above the stage providing maximum
visibility for what promises to be a

sold-out audience. Around the stage will
be Yes’ roadcases which bolt together
into a barricade.

This unique staging was designed by
Mike Tate. Tate has worked with Yes on
their past two tours. His predecessor,
Roger Dean, designed staging during
Yes’ mid—Seventies toT1rs and also created
many album covers (“Fragile,” “Close
To The Edge,” “Yes_songs,” “Relayer”).

The sound system will be provided by
Clair Brother, an audio outﬁt located near
Lancaster, Pennsylvania, who haved
worked with Yes through much of the
group’s ten year history. Also, there will
be eight off-stage spotlights used in
addition to those above.

Yes will most likely be promoting their
newest album, “Tormato,” which was
released in September 1978. “Tormato”
was the group’s tenth album and ‘has thus
far failed to please critics or fans.

Yes is planning to release a new
double-live album sometime in May.

DC Band Adds Fans

By KAREN METZIN GER

The DC Band has been performing at

the Razzberry Rhinoceros in Shadyside

for the past twenty-ﬁve months, and each
time they perform they add more fans to
their large and loyal following. It is hard
to" say exactly how they do this.

The band consists of. ﬁve musicians:
D.C. Fitzgerald on guitar‘ and vocals,
exhibiting an amazing facility for finger
picking; Rick Lacey, guitar and vocals;
Bob Beach, saxophone, flute, vocals, and
according to many local musicians the
best harmonica player in town; Jack
Schultzon bass and Ed Landers playing
drums. Each musician is capable of any
style of music, but DC plays a brand of
their own. While it’s not jazz, the DC
Band provides the same spontaneity and
individual additions. V

“Our music is un1abellable,” said band
leader Fitzgerald. A

The music is ninety percent original
tunes encompassing blues, country, blue
grass and pure rock n’ roll.

“The rest is tuned to what’s happening,”
said Fitzgerald.

The Razzberry Rhinoceros -is a comfort-
able place. The wooden tables and bar,
the people that crowd in to hear the band
and have a few drinks with friends, the
huge (you guessed it) raspberry
rhinoceros painted on the wall all lend an
easy feeling to the evening. The fun
begins with the band.

Not only dothe listeners get to have a
good time, but it’s easy to see that the
band’s having a great time too.
Throughout the sets they’ll trade off

vocals and solo spots. They'll tease and

play with each‘ other, finding more in the
music than just the original tune. The
audience seems to pick up on the good
time.

Now, you could sit home with your
favorite people, with the best musicians
playing on the stereo, but you wouldn’t
get the same feeling of having a good
time that the DC Band can give you.

The DC Band appears regularly at the
Razzberry Rhinoceros on Walnut Street,
Shadyside, Wednesday and Friday nights
and Saturday afternoons from 4PM to
8PM.

Roxy  Music: Impressive Show At The Stanley  

By M.PATRICK MONAHAN

After a three year absence from a
Pittsburgh stage, Eng1and’s best kept
musical secret, Roxy Music, returned
triumphantly Monday night to the Stanley
Theatre. They performed an hour and a
half setiof their own unique brand of
progressive English rock before a small
but highly attentive and appreciative
audience.

The last time Roxy was in town at
Carnegie-Mellon University in March of
1976.Shortly after that, the band came to
a halt when individual -group members
decided to pursue solo projects outside
the contextof Roxy Music;

The version of Roxy which played
Monday night consisted of head
songwriter and lead vocalist, the

debonaire Bryan Ferry, Andy MacKay on

reeds and horns, guitar wizard Phil
Manznera, stalwart ’ drummer Paul
Thompson, all from the previous touring
line-up; and two new members on bass
and keyboards, Gary Tibbs and Allen
Spenner..

Since Roxy Music could never ‘be
considered a mainstream AM group;
they've" never built a larger, following_in
America that theyalready have in»Europe
and England. <

However,.with the release of the new
album, “Manifesto,” and the band’s

determination to tour America, and- with w

their highly crafted, intelligent and
sophisticated sound and stage act, Roxy
might just garner the much-needed
critical and commercial acclaim their
die-hard fans and critics have felt they’ve
deserved all along.

At the core of Roxy’s stage appeal
Monday night was the much acclaimed
but misunderstood )especially by Amer-
ican audiences), chief lyricist and vocalist
Bryan Ferry.

The nattily—dressed Ferry appeared
onstage in a pink suit and tie, with white
leisure shoes, and hasibeen the brain and
mostlout-front talent Roxy has had since
their inception back in 1971. '

When the band opened with the
hypnotic title track from their latest
album, “Manifest,”it was quite evident
Roxy and Ferry are not-your typical three
chord and a cloud of dust rockers, but
instead offer a more polished and
different approach to rock music.

Roxy’s music was coldly hypnotic, at
times funky and soulful, and at times
blistering rock n’ roll. '

Although the group sound was most
stressed, there were moments when
individual members took nicely timed and
entertaining solos.

Ferry, who will stand out in any crowd of
contemporary rock crooners, had a classy,

rcigarette-cool stage stance and a

haunting voice, which was both effective
on mysterious ballads (“Mother of
Pearl,’_’ “Angel eyes” and “Out of the
Blue”) and funky and thumping
space-age-style rhythm and blues (“Love
is the Drug,” “Just Like You,_” “My
Little Girl” and “Do the Strand”).

MacKay and Manznera, both talented
musicians with acclaimed outside solo
work, displayed their immense skills on
their respective instruments and comple-
mented Ferry and the group sound in
general the whole night.

The guitarist Manznera was extraor-
dinarily psychedelic-like, with his soar-
ing, intense, and crisp guitar barrages
(as in “Out of the Blue,” “Manifesto”
and “Song for Europe”). '

The duckwalking antics of MacKay and
hot playing on both reeds and saxophones
(“Ain’t That So,” “Song for Europe,”
“Just Like You), also contributed
impressively to the interesting Roxy act.

Roxy’s stage set-up had the band placed

Bryan Ferry, loader and driving force behind Roxy Music.

between towering pyramid-like arches,
complete with Romanesque-like steps
leading to a backdrop of clouds which
added a celestial and purifying feel to

Roxy’s ‘invigorating and multi-layered

sound of guitar, voice, keyboard, bass,
drums and various woodwind andrbrass
instruments.

All in all, it was a successful night of
rock music, mating the appreciative Roxy
fans with the talented andrefreshingly

= different members of the group that make

up one of England’s true musical
treasures, Roxy Music.

Opening for Roxy. and.-making their first
visit to Pittsburgh, were Irish folk rockers

Horslips.

Although this quintet—composed of
members on guitars, bass, keyboards,
electric violin and voice—played no
familiar material, but their profession-
alism and crisp executions of highly
charged and intense renditions of electric ‘

Irish folk rock earnedthem a positive I

response from the Stanley Theatre crowd.
Particular standouts in their 50 minute

set included ‘ ‘The Power and the Glory, ” “

“Blind Man,-” “The Men Who Built
America” and “Lonliness.” - ’
With increased FM airplay and

continued touring the band has a chance
to catch on in America.

Phoebe Snow Secure And Versatile In Concert

By MICHAEL McCABE

Phoebe Snow .
Duquesne University Student Union
Ballroom

Many musicians sound better on their
recordings, than they do in person.
Phoebe Snow isn’t one of them. Few
singers have voices to compare with hers
and hearing her live is the best way to
appreciate her full range and power.

The mood of Snow’s performance
Friday night was warm and relaxed.
Conﬁdent that her music was enough to
offer by itself, she didn’t add any frills of
showmanship. Chatting and joking
casually between the songs, Snow was
content just being herself—-simple and
friendly.

Snow’s vocals were unquestionably the
main focus of the .show. Everything ‘else
was peripheral. There was no heavy
instrumentation to distract attention from
her singing. For backup, Snow had only
the basics; lead guitar, bass guitar,
keyboards and drums. Her band played
proficiently and stayed in the background
except for some occasional solos.

As far as material, the show was

balanced beautifully. Snow sang five
songs from her latest album, “Against
the Grain,” plus an assortment of
previous material including all of her
most popular tunes.

Snow’s material itself isn’t especially
distinctive. It’s more geared for wide
popular appeal. Her main stock is the
gentle love song such as “Poetry Man,”
“Don’t Let Me Down” and, from ‘her
newest album, ‘‘In My Life.”

Snow did many songs written by others
such as Paul McCartney's “Every Night”
and Stephen Bishop’s “Never Letting
Go.” Some of the songs were borrowed
standards like “Love Makes a Woman”
and “He’s Not Just Another Man”
(originally; “She’s Not Just Another
Woman”). But Snow got away with this.
Her voice was so dynamic she put new life
into whatever she sang.

The variety of different musical styles
woven into Snow’s performance showed
another of her assets—versatility. She
proved herself capable at everything from
blues, jazz and reggae to gospel, folk and
country.

There was one bad moment in the
show. Show was starting in on “No
Regrets,” a smooth night club jazz
number, when a sudden burst of feedback

  
      
   
  

 Pittsburgh Plan for Art

stopped her. For a few minutes she
couldn’t hear anything.
“Don’t panic,” Snow told the crowd.

at the White House

Balletsuperstar Mikhail Baryshnikov (left) and his
colleagues from the New York City Ballet Patricia
McBride (right) and Heather Watts are joined by a group
of young ballet students in a dazzling performance for
President and Mrs. Jimmy Carter on ‘BARYSHNIKOV AT
THE WHITE HOUSE,’ airing nationally over PBS on Easter
Sunday, April 15. ‘ l
7 The program, taped February 25 in the East Room
I of the executive mansion, is the fifth in a series of public

television broadcasts of White House performances by
distinguished artists. The broadcasts are produced by
WETA/Washington, D.C.

Critics were unanimous in their applause for the
Baryshnikov White House performance. ‘‘In some of his
jump-turns he seemed literally suspended in mid-air,"
wrote Anna Kisselgoff in her review of the event for The
New York Times. The performance by the man President
Carter called “perhaps the finest dancer of our Iifetime"
will now be shared for the first time with television
viewers. _

The program of works by renowned choreographers
George Balanchine and Jerome Robbins includes the
world premiere of a Chopin waltz choreographed by
Robbins and performed by Baryshnikov and McBride.
Miss McBride and Mr. Baryshnikov are joined by a group
of children ranging in age from nine to 12 for a selection
from ‘Har|equinade,' Balanchine's delightful version of a
classic ballet in the commedia dell'arte tradition.

Heather Watts is Baryshnikov's partner for the pas
de deux from Balanchine's ‘Rubies,’ and Patricia

~ McBride joins him for ‘Tarantella,’ also by
Balanchine. ~

Hailed as one of the greatest dancers of the century,
Baryshnikov has had ballets created especially for him
by some of the world's most renowned choreographers.
He has produced and choreographed two full-length
ballets and has made several major appearances on
public television. His movie debut in Herbert Ross’ film
‘The Turning Point’ dramatically widened the scope of
his popularity.

Host_for ‘Baryshnikov at the White House’ is Edward

Q 9

by Joey Sasso .

CONFIDENTIAL REPORT: ‘Laverne's' success almost
wrecked Penny Marshall's home life, the superstar said
recently. Eveninow the reclusive Penny, 36, still finds
herself racked by gui|t——guilt about losing touch with her
12-year-old daughter Tracy, and guilt about her rocky
marriage to Rob Reiner (of ‘All in the Family’). “You see,
I went from being an unknown who was home 18 hours
a day to someone who just came home to sleep," she
told me. “For almost two years, Rob and I had no time
for each other——| was too busy playing Laverne.” The
pressure of starring in TV's top-rated comedy finally got
to her, she said. “There were times when I didn’t feel
married anymore. I wasn't doing the things that used
to make me feel domestic. And when I saw my marriage
develop problems I had just two options: Get out of the
marriage or get out of the show. I wasn't willing todo
either one.” What Penny did do was take a tip from
Laverne: Be cool. Take life as it comes. “I stopped giving

into pressures,” she said. ‘‘I came to realize that,

spending one hour with my daughter instead of 18 could
be just as rich." And, she says, she and her hubby of
five years have no intention of splittin up. . . Shocking
details are beginning to emerge from usan St. James’
divorce. And they paint a picture of an ugly, bitter
courtroom battle. During a hearing at the Los Angeles
Superior Court, the ‘MacMillan and Wife‘ co-star claimed
makeup artist husband Thomas E. Lucas had: thrown
her—fu|ly clothed—into their swimmingtpool, locked
her out of the house, held a knife at her throat and
attacked photographers who were trying to take the
couple’s picture. Susan, 32, made the complaints in
court papers she filed to fight Lucas’ request for joint
custody of their two children, Harmony, four, and
Sunshine, six.

‘Mlle goes for gigles

rather than guffaws
by Les Slater

Not all of ‘NBC's Saturday Night Live’ is comedy in
the uproarious style. And among ‘Saturday Night’
personnel, writer Marilyn Miller (seated with Gilda
Radner, standing) has emerged as pretty much the
“resident specialist” in the softer approach——the pieces
that make a point of not going repeatedly for the big
belly laugh. _

Before joining the writing staff, Marilyn worked as
a writer for several sitcoms including ‘Mary Tyler Moore,’
‘Rhoda’ and ‘Welcome Back, Kotter.' When ‘Saturday
Night. Live’ premiered in 1975, Marilyn needed only to
get assurance from producer Lorne Michaels that her
contributions, whatever their comedic form, would do
nothing but enhance. the show’s content.

She had worked with Michaels previously on a Lily
Tomlin _special and, ironically, it was ‘Tess,’ a piece
presented during TomIin's second.._stint hosting the show,
that became Marilyn's first ‘Sat_I_.Ir.day Night"work»1in the
serio-comic genre. - — . -.  .

The warm response to.__‘Tess," in which Tomlin
portrayed a lonely, eccentricspihster, provided Marilyn
with instant inducement to continue the trend. ’ '

That trend has produced such off-the—beaten-track
material as Cissy Spacek and John Belushi playing a
newly married young couple trying to deal with the.
reality of his impotence; Jane Curtin, as the former high
school cheerleader captain, and Dan Ackroyd, as the
biggest nerd of all time, running into each other; and
Richard Dreyfuss and Laraine Newman as a couple
whose sexual incompatibility is creating problems in their
relationship. ,

|t's.on pieces like these that Marilyn can be seen
somewhere off-stage during dress rehearsals or the "live
telecasts, emoting intensely, right along with the players
on camera.

Why such openly passionate involvement in her
work? '‘It's funny," she says, “but when I write a piece
that's only comedy, l'm farless interested in its outcome
than I am in a piece that's heavier. I think it’s‘because

company’s Obie Award winning “The

Mabou Mines, a theater collaborative

with ‘its production of “B Beaver
Animation.” They are one of the oldest
and most respected avant-garde theater
companies in the country, having won
five Obies previous to “Shaggy Dog
Animation.”

Noticeably. condensed from the three
and a half hour original, “Shorter Shaggy

 FIFTH A VENUE

The play was written and conceived for
the stage by Lee Breuer. It deals with the
love story of John and Rose; a story so
tragic that Rose’s life, metaphorically,
becomes like that of a dog.

Rose is represented on stage by a
Banraku puppet. The puppet is
manipulated by three actors who speak all
Rose’s lines. Their voices, in turn, are
manipulated by an Eden Harmonizer
represented on stage by a giant radio.

As each level of manipulation becomes
manifest and the voices become more and
more distorted, an eerie and surreal
feeling overwhelms the audience.

While the overall effect is chilling, it is
also overplayed. The snthesizer truely
runs the show by making many of the
lines completely inaudible and a
minimum of stage movement makes the
audience itchy to escape the cacaphony.

Mabou Mines’ technique is so bizarre
that many people had difficulty grasping
the story line. This bewilderment,
nevertheless, can only be overcome by
more exposure to alternative theater
productions; a task the 99 cent Floating
Theater continues to fulfill. '

WHODUNNIT

Thursday, April 12 is the premiere
date of a new and unique NBC-TV
limited series called ‘Whodunnit.' The
mystery-gameshow is hosted by Ed
McMahon (pictured). Experts and
contestants try to solve a crime after
“witnessing" a tape of it, sifting clues
and alibis and questioning the su-
spects. To win a big cash prize they
must determine the culprit and the
motive in a limitedtime. The noted
lawyer F. Lee Bailey is scheduled to
. be one of the panelists.

immediately following, ‘Highcliffe
Manor’ will premiere on NBC. ‘The
Blacke Death‘ episode stars Shelley
Fabares and Stephen McHattie. The
gothic comedy series is about the
follies of Helen Straight Blacke, a
widow who inherits her husband's
castle which is also a “think tank"
filled with eccentric scientists and
philosophers who are more deter-
mined to oust her from their midst
than find solutions to world problems.
Co-starring as residents of the manor
are Eugenie Ross-Leming, Gerald
Gordon, Audrey Landers, Jenny
O'Hara and Harold Sakata. ’

Breakfast In America
Supertramp
A&M

There are few surprises on Super-
tramp’s new album, “Breakfast In
America.” All the unmistakable
elements of Supertramp’s style are
here---rapid driving rhythms, crisp
vocals, keyboard work so powerful it
overwhelms the ears and lyrics ranging
from humorous sarcasm to bitter
denunciation.

Ric Davies and Roger Hodgson
alternate on vocals throughout the album.

Davies has the deeper, more expressive _

voice, but Hodgson’s singing is an
important part of Supertramp’s sound.
Both are credited on the album for
keyboard work. John Helliwell’s work on

vwoodwinds, sax and harmonica often‘

adds layers of sound and interest to
Supertramp’s songs. Doug Thompson’s
bass and Bob Benberg’s drums provide a
strong underlining for the rest of the
band.

Side one seems a bit boring. The
material is good, but there is just too
‘much on this side that has already been
‘done before on previous Supertramp
albums. There are amusing parodies of
the Bee Gees on “Gone Hollywood” and
pf Franki Valli on “Goodbye Stranger,”
which describes the “love her. leave her”
attitude. ,_

“Logical Song” attacks a society whose
highest value is conformity and is the
strongest cut on the side, but it, too,
sounds familiar.

Nothing New On Supertramp’s Breakfast In America

Supertramp’s new album, “Breakfast in America,” only half good.

Side two is much better. The material is
less forced, more original and varied. The

overall tempo of the side is slower and
less urgent. The lyrics are more inspired
and emotional.

“Take the Long Way Home” opens with
a bluesy harmonica solo and continues
with a strong rhythmic melody. It
describes the changes in life that

performing can cause. A beautiful sax
and acoustic piano duet mark the
introspective and emotional “Lord Is It
Mine.” ,

“Just Another Nervous Wreck” is
strong song of frustration and pent-up
rage . “Casual Conversations” is almost
waltzlike and very mellow. “Child of
Vision” is a good closing number, using a

jazzy piano solo over a pulsating rock
beat.
Side two is easily the better half of the

album while side oneleaves just a little to

be desired. It’s up to you to decide
whether half a new Supertramp album is
better than none.

PHIL CONTES V

Tonio K ’s Weird Quest For Lifeln The Foodchain

Life in the Foodchain
Tonio K
Full Moon-Epic

Every now and then an album by some
unknown member of the music under-
world comes along that is guaranteed to
make any and all listeners ask, “what’s
going on here? Is this thing for real?”

Tonio K’s “Life in the Foodchain” is
such an album.

It’s a rather demented environmental
concept album about “life in the
foodchain and love among the ruins.”
The lyrics range from mild humor to raw
sarcasism. Musically, the album is a
strange concoction of punk,» New Wave,

Art Garfunkel

rock ‘n’ roll, blues and even a little
country and western. .

Side one opens _with the title track,
“Life in the Foodchain.” It establishes
the album’s rather negative tone when
Tonio sings, “everything gets to this
certain dimension, winds up on a
customer’s plate and then gone.”

It’s followed by “The Funky Western
Civilization,” a tune that would have any
disco "freak reeling in pain on the dance
ﬂoor. In this-dance you “just grab your
partner by the hair, throw her down and
leave her there.”

Next is “Willie and the Pigman."
Willie is a renegade on the run---the
Pigman is “Champion of the luckless,

lunchless, faceless little folks.” He
makes a phone call and “next thingWillie
knows the whole thing is over.” So is the
song fortunately.

The first side closes with “The Ballad
of the Night the Clocks all Quit (and the
Government Failed)”---which is exactly
what it sounds like it would be about.

Side Two, which is subtitled “Love
Among the Ruins,” opens with “Amer-
ican Love Affair.” It’s a song about
greed---Jacob’s and sweet Rebecca’s.

The middle of the album is filled in by
“How Come I Can’t See You in My
Mirror?” “Better Late than Never” and
“A Lover’s Plea.” All three are sick love
songs that fall onto that thin line between

barely tolerable and totally obnoxious.

If listeners can make it to the end of the
second side they can hear the album’s
best tune, a V punk-rocker called

"‘H-A-T-R-E-D.” The song starts out

very slowly, then launches into a scream
of inaudible lyrics and blaring guitars.
It’s a great song to play the next time one

.feels like hanging speakers out the

window and bothering "the neighbors.

“Life in the Foodchain” is so absurd
and obnoxious that it will probably get
more publicity than it deserves. That’s
about the best thing that can be said for
this album.

MARK HOLAN

Garfunkel Has Perfect New Album

Fate For Breakfast
Art Garfunkel
Columbia

“Fate For Breakfast” isn’t a superb
album, but more appropriately it should
be labeled, a perfect album. “Fate For
Breakfast” is Art Garfunkel’s follow-up
to his “Watermark” release, considered
by many as being one of the premiere
easy-listening albums ever recorded. It's
hard to avoid comparison between the
two albums, but how do you follow-up the
best?

“Watermark” was effective in its
continuity—courtesy of composer Jimmy
Webb. “Fate For Breakfast” is effective
in its diversity, offering the listener
various interpretations of intimacy

ranging from the Skyliner’s “Since I
Don't Have You,” to Stephen Bishop’s
“Sail on a Rainbow.”

Opening the album is “In a Little
While.” It begins with a hard rhythm
line accented with a crisp up—tempo beat,

-complete with soul overtones.

On the classic “Since I Don't Have
You” Garfunkel’s vocals are intimately
delicate and coupled with a light tenor sax
played by Michael Brecker make this one
of the album’s standouts.

Following is David Batteau’s and Mike
Sembello’s “And I Know.” Particularly
notable are Leah Kunkel’s background
vocals. Next is the ethereal “Sail on a
Rainbow.” Here Garfunkel’s vocals are
unparalleled and again we have one of the
album’s standouts. Closing side one is an

easy-listening tune titled “Miss You
Nights.”

Side two opens with three brisk
easy-listening pieces, “Finally Found a
Reason,” “Beyond the Tears” and “Oh
How Happy.”

“When Someone Doesn’t Want You”
features Brecker on sax again, with tight
instrumental support from crack studio
musicians Steve Gadd, Richard Tee and
Hugh McCracken. All combine with
Garfunkel’s vocals to form another of the
album’s premiere cuts. Closing “Fate
For Breakfast” is another up-tempo piece
titled “Take Me Away.”

Generally “Fate For Breakfast” isn’t
as tight as “Watermark,” but overall it’s
a ﬂawless piece of music.

Albums

 Manifesto, Reunion Album For Rox y Music

Manifesto
Roxy Music
Ateo

In 1976, after a series of popular
European releases, and the ﬁrst tastes of
mass American success, Roxy Music
broke-up. Business pressures on their
freedom was the main reason cited, as
well as musical stagnation.

In 1979, Roxy Music has reformed and
is touring the U.S. featuring their new
album Manifesto. This album brings
together -original band members Bryan
Ferry, Phil Manzanera, Andy Mackay,
and Paul Tompson; plus new member
Gary Tibbs.

The new album is a synthesis of all the
work Roxy Music has done in the past
with inﬂuences taken from the two most
vital branches of pop music; Disco and
the New Wave. The “west” side of the
album features most of the material that
uses a strong‘ disco and pop inﬂuence.
much in the same way the Stones used
disco on the song “Miss You,” only more
polished. Also, Roxy Music doesn’t use
these inﬂuences for their own sake, but
rather as the backround for the scenes of
romance that Bryan Ferry creates. An
example would be “Spin Me Round”
where the protagonist describes the
melancholy of a deserted ballroom.
“Dance Away,” describes a break-up

with the memorable phrase “hand in.
hand with another guy, dressed to kill,
and guess who's dying.”

Some purists will bemoan the disco
element in some of the songs. This is a
mistake, however, because this element
fits in well with Bryan Ferry’s
everpresent descriptions of the jaded and
sophisticated life.

On the “east” side, Roxy shows their
new wave inﬂuences to best advantage on
the title track “Manifesto.” The song
begins with brooding synthesizers and an
ominous rhythm section until Phil
Manzanera’s guitar cuts through the
gloom and opens things up for Ferry’s
ode to “the man who wants tomorrow,

there’s one in every town. A crazy guy.
he would rather die, than be tied down.”

Overall this album represents a major
change in Roxy Music's style; not so
much musically, but in"; attitude. The old
live for today attitude has been replaced
by a new seriousness. Specifically, Bryan
Ferry’s voice has developed much more

depth having lost the cloying quality it_

had previously.
Roxy Music could have chosen to

repeat their past efforts but have chosen B

instead to adapt and progress in a new
musical situation. ‘

Redd Foxx ’ Encyclopedia of Black Comedy

By GARY BRADFORD

The Redd Foxx Encyclopedia
of Black Humor

Redd Foxx and Norma Miller
Ward Ritchie Press

This book isn’t an encyclopedia, it’s
more an anecdotal history of black
American comedy and several of its
practitioners. Histories are often dry fact
recitations, but the “Redd Foxx
Encyclopedia” moves swiftly, just as
good comedy is supposed to. '

The _main authors are long-time
entertainers who actually participated in

much of what they describe. Foxx, before
his rise to national prominence in TV’s
“Sanford and Son,” had over thirty years
of show business experience, working
virtually unknown to white audiences
because his so-called “blue” humor was
barred from mainstream entertainment
outlets. Miller, one of a handful of black
comediennes, once headed a dance
troupe and was Foxx’s protege for many
years.

The book traces the growth of black
humor from slavery to Richard Pryor.
In between the two are the rise and fall of
ministrel shows, the ﬁrst black Broadway
shows, the segregated vaudeville circuit

‘Good As Gold’,
Satirical Look At Politics

By PATTY TASCARELLA

Good as Gold
By Joseph Heller

Over 16 years ago, Joseph Heller wrote
“Catch-22”—a brilliant and satiric ‘look

at army life during World War II that was —.
savage, hilarious and poignant all at’ the

same time. The title itself referred to
double talk and Heller has brought out
this concept for another round in “Good
as Gold,” where the satire plays on
politics instead of the military.

And it works. “Good as Gold” is as
biting, witty and scathing as its
predecessor but that’s where the problem
1ies—it’s been told before and told better.
“Good as Gold” lacks the ﬂeeting
moments of warmth and compassion
“Catch-22" had.

Part of the fault lies with the
hero—Bruce Gold. Gold is researching a
book on the Jewish experience in America
when he is approached by a college friend
.who offers him a high administrative post

'l

in Washington.

Gold, greedy for fame and fortune,
eagerly swoops down to the capital,
discarding his dumpy wife along the way
for a sleek but vapid WASP heiress

' named Andrea Biddle Conover.

Conover, equal parts Page Lee Hufty
and Tandy Dickinson, plays catch-22 with
Gold; she refuses to marry him until he
gets the appointment which he won’t get
until he marries her.

There are some funny sections to be
sure. Conover’s aged but still bigoted
father’s meeting with Gold and Gold’s
mentor in the administration telling him
“We want a man with integrity who'll do
what we tell him” are scenes where’
Heller is at his best.

But the character of Gold is not an
attractive one and it is next to impossible
to feel for him.

“Good as Gold” is a reworking
of“Catch-22" and is the afterma
nothing happening with Helle 
‘ ‘ Something Happened. ’ ’ The
returning to tried and true territ o‘ 1‘-

And, again, nothing happens.

   
  
 

and the -evolution of black comedians
from clowns forced to wear burnt cork in
order to be “acceptable,” to articulate
stand-up monologuists.

Several of the older comedians wrote
their own chapters, explaining how they
developed routines and how they coped
with show business racism. (Black
performers usually cou1dn’t enter white
theaters unless they were on the bill.)
Scatman Crothers may be the only
familiar name among the old-timers, due
to his exposure on TV’s “Chico and the
Man.”

There is also a chapter on comedien-

nes, which Miller turns into a stand-up
routine. The chapter is hilarious, but the
comediennes are pushed aside, and little
information is given about them.
This is the book’s main fault; too many
comics, especially the younger ones,"
receive only cursory attention. _ The
chapter on the late Godfrey Cambridge is
merely a reprinted interview he gave to
someone other than Foxx or Miller.

But this fault only frustrates, it doesn't
totally distract.
Encyclopedia” tackles a long ignored
subject, and -for once the writers aren’t
outside critics, but people who are what
they write about.

said. “However, they must learn
to respect the beauty around Pitt.

In the last moments of a full day
of final arguments, attorney
Marvin Mitchelson asked Superior
Court Judge Arthur Marshall to
give Miss Marvin half of the actor’s
$1.8 million in assets acquired
during the six years they were
lovers;

“He took both halves and we
want our half back,” said Mitchel-
son.

Mitchelson had the last word in
the three month trial as he
answered a lengthy summation by
Marvin’s lawyer, A. David Kagon,
who said the former showgirl was
not entitled to any of Marvin’s
money.

Marshall said he would study
some 8,00 pages of trial transcript
before issuing his ruling.

During ﬁnal arguments, the
judge sharply questioned both
attorneys on crucial details of the
romance which ﬁgured heavily in
testimony.

Kagon tried to convince Marshall
that Miss Marvin, who lived with
the actor from 1964 to 1970,
received enough luxuries during
the affair to compensate him for
housewifely duties.

Penguins   Down Buffalo Sabres in First Playoff, 4-3

By The Associated Press

BUFFALO N.Y.—Pittsburgh’s
Blair Chapman, Gary McAdam and
Orest Kindrachuk scored third-per-
iod goals Tuesday as the Penguins
defeated Buffalo 4-3 in the
preliminary round of the Stanley
Cup. playoffs.

The second game of the
best-of-three National Hockey
League series will be played
Thursday in Pittsburgh.

Goalie Denis Herron of the
Penguins almost singlehandedly

, held his club together through the

ﬁrst two periods, when Pittsburgh
was outshot 23-15.

However, the Penguins ap-
peared to get their second wind as
Chapman poked the puck past
Buffalo goalie Bob Sauve with 5:21
elapsed in the ﬁnal frame.

That tied the score 2-2, and
McAdam, who returned to Memor-
ial Auditorium in triumph after
starting the season with Buffalo,

and Kindrachuk scored about two
minutes apart late in the period.

The victory perpetuated a
Pittsburgh hex against the Sabres
extending to March 1976, the last
time Buffalo defeated the Pen-
quins. Pittsburgh ran its record
against Buffalo since then to 7-0-8
in their ﬁrst-ever playoff meeting.

Buffalo led 1-0 in the first
period, and 2-1 in the second on
goals by Mike Boalnd and Rene
Robert, respectively, with Andre
Savard assisting on each.

Boland, a rookie defenseman,
broke the ice with a 50-foot sizzler
past Herron while the goalie’s

- vision was obscured by players in

front of the net, but the Penguins
foreshadowed what was to come by
scoring just 39 seconds later when
Tom Bladon fired from long range
and Rod Schutt tipped the shot into
the net.

With about two and a half
minutes left in the game, Buffalo’s

Don Luce scored to narrow the

Pittsburgh edge to one goal, but
the Penquins threw up a stone wall
in front of their net to thwart
Buffalo shots thereafter.

Pittsburgh, which began the
game with four regulars out
because of injuries, lost center
Gregg Sheppard at least for the
night when he was crashed to the
ice by Sabres defenseman Jerry
Korab. Sheppard was taken to
Buffalo General Hospital for
X-rays.

National latter of Intent day arrives with Panther hopes of finding replacements
for players such as Terry Knight.

     Coaches   Wait -lntently,
    Hopeto Sign Hoopers

By SAMUEL SCIULLO
Pitt News Staff Writer

Today is the day when high school basketball
playersaround the country are supposed to sign
letters-of-intent which commit them .to one par-
ticular college. .;

But with the ever-increasing‘ number of post-
season all-star games throughout the country,
players are subjected to more recruiting
pressures, and many youths delay their signings
until summer.

At Pitt, no high school players have signed as
yet, but Wilkinsburg’s 6-foot-1 John Ryan is ex-
pected to sign soon. Ryan is a point guard and
he’ll have to compete with sophomores-to—be
Dwayne Wallace, Darrell Gissendanner and
Scott Grevey.

The Panthers have an excellent chance of lan-
ding Schenley’s Larry Anderson, a 6-foot—6

southpaw who has good quickness and a superb.

outside shot. Anderson has visited Nevada-Las
Vegas, and could take in the sights of North
Carolina-Charlottesvile this weekend, but when
the hoopla is over, he should become a Pitt Pan-
ther. A

Despite some reporets to the contrary, Pitt

also has high hopes of landing Valley High
School’s 6-foot—6 Bill Varner, MVP on the Penn-
sylvania squad in last week’s Roundball Classic.
Classic.

Varner is a very versatile performer and is
capable of playing at least three positions on the
court: second guard, forward and center. His

* style of play is reminiscent of former Panthers

Keith Starr and Terry Knight.

Pitt, Duquesne and Marquette are the three
schools prominently mentioned concerning Var-
ner and it says here he’ll pick either the first or
third name in the aforementioned list.

Tim Grgurich has also spent a great deal of
time in the state of Georgia, seeking Southwest
Macon’s 6—foot-4 Michael _I-lunt, Atlanta’s 6-
foot-10 Ted Benson and 6—foot-7 Avery
Rawlings.

Benson visited Pitt last week along with Hunt,
and the Panther staff is optimistic about signing
at least one ofthe pair.

PITT NOTES: Former Panther star Kirk
Bruce has been named assistant coach at Robert

vMorris College. Bruce held the head coaching

job at Clairton High School this year and will
now serve under newly-appointed head coach
Matt Furjanic.

  Pirates’ Parker Out to Protect Face, Wonies Card GM

By The Associated Press

PITTSBURGH—The Pittsburgh
Pirates said Tuesday slugger Dave

Parker—'doesn’t plan to wear the

face guard that made him look a
football linebacker on the bases.

The National League baseball
team made the announcement after
St. Louis Cardinal Manager Ken
Boyer ﬁled a protest with league
President Charles Feeney over
‘Parker’s use of the football-type
mask. 3

‘ ‘After Saturday’s game when he
had a close play at home plate,
Parker said he wasn’t going to wear
the helmet again,” said Sally
O’Leary, 3 team spokeswoman.
“On Sunday the bat boy came out
with the helmet and he threw it
away.”

Feeney contacted Harding Pe-
terson, executive vice president of

the Pirates, concerning Boyer’s
protest, she said.

Parker, who signed a contract
this season that reportedly makes

him baseball's first million dollar-
a-year player, began wearing the
protective mask last season after
his left cheek was fractured in three
places. .

He wore the mask Saturday
when he steamrolled into Montreal
catcher Gary Carter and scored a
run giving the Pirates a. 7-6_ victory
over the Expos.

Carter caught the relay throw
well ahead of Parker’s arrival and
applied a two-handed tag—but
Parker knocked the ball loose and
was called safe by minor league
umpire Joe Schratz.

“He intimidates you wearing tha
mask,” said Boyer. “Heck, he
scares you without it.”

John Clairborne, general mana-

ger of the Cardinals, said the p
team’s top brass became concerned
about the effect of a football helmet
on Parker’s imposing 6-foot-5,

incident.

about it.’ ’

“He could crash through anyone
wearing a football helmet,” said
“We were concerned

Clairborne said‘ he understood

Parker could wear protective gear if
the Pirate's team physician
deemed it necessary.

“If he wants to wear it for his
health and safety, we’ll get a
doctor’s statement,” said 0’Leary.

Schmidt Singles Home 7-3 Win

By The Associated Press

PHILADELPI-IIA—Pete Rose
ripped two doubles and a single but
it took Mike Schmidt’s two-run,
seventh-inning bases-loaded single
to give the Philadelphia Phillies at
7-3 victory over the Pittsburgh
Pirates Tuesday night. _

Pinch-hitter Bake McBride star-
ted the Phillies’ seventh with a
walk off reliever Enrique Romo,
but was forced by Larry Bowa.
Rose then laced his third hit, a
double. Kent Tekulve replaced
Rome and intentionally walked
Greg Luzinski to load the bases.

Tekulve then gave up a single to
Schmidt that snapped a 3-3 tie.
Manny Trillo singled home the
ﬁnal two runs.

Pittsburgh took a 1-0 lead in the
second when Bill Robinson doubled
and scored on a single by Ed Ott.

Schmidt, ‘however, opened the
Phillies’ second with a double and
scored the tying run on a double by
Garry Maddox. Maddox eventually
scored on Bob Boone’s single.

The Phillies added a run in the
sixth on a triple by Maddox and a
ground-rule double by Trillo.

Rose boosted his number of
at-bats since coming to the
National League 17 years ago to
10,210, moving past Tris Speaker
into eigth place on the all-time
at-bats list. Speaker had 10,208.
He also boosted his career doubles
to 504, passing Detroit's Charley
Gehringer for eighth place.

The Pirates tied it in the seventh
when Phil Garner singled, and
pinch hitter John Milner tripled off
right ﬁelder Lonnie Smith’s glove.
Milner came home on a wild pitch
by Dick Ruthven.

Panther Pitcher Boyle
Very Versatile Athlete

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer. I

Talk about versatility—Jim
Boyle started this year playing
volleyball and is now pitching for
Pitt’s baseball team (2-0).

Boyle, a six-foot-three, 192-

‘ pound junior from York, Pa., was a

middle blocker on Pitt’s volleyball
team before quitting in January to
join pre-season baseball workouts.

“I don’t really like to say I quit,”
Boyle said. “Baseball coach (Bob)

Lewis suggested that I stop playing”

and join baseball practice. He was
worried I would sprain an ankle or
something. ’ ’ ,

Boyle wishes he was playing
volleyball now.

“I was having fun,” said the
junior, who started at middle
blocker. “But it was only right that
I stop playing since I am on a
baseball scholarship.” '

Boyle is in the Panthers’
starting pitching rotation and had
never played volleyball before
coming to Pitt.

“I’ve always played baseball,
but never volleyball,” he said. “I
even swam for awhile. My mother
was a state champion swimmer in
Michigan and swam_ at Michigan
State, so she had me in the pool

“I had watched some (volleyball)
games,” added Boyle. “I started
play last year. Pitt had a volleyball
club that I played for.

“The volleyball coach, Mike
Hebert, apparently had seen me in
some pickup basketball games and
thought I would be a pretty good
volleyball player.”

According to Boyle, volleyball is
a “much more demanding” sport,
but that ' baseball is “more
relaxing.”

“In volleyball, you’re constantly
moving,” the junior explained.
“You have to be in really good
physical shape to’ play. I know I’m

not in as good of condition as I was

during the volleyball season.”
Although he misses playing
volleyball, Boyle is happy to be
playing baseball. —
“I’ve always enjoyed baseball
he said. “It’s very relaxing,
especially during the summer when
you play games in the early
evening. To me, there’s something
relaxing about playing then.”
Bothered by injury and illness for
the past two season, Boyle has yet
to enjoy a winning season at Pitt.

tournament fielded a 10-team

lineup including the number two
team in the East, Penn State and
host George Mason.

The Panthers opened play
against the favored Penn State
Nittany Lions. Pitt got»-off to a slow
start in the first game and lost,
15-5. Pitt lost the second game,
15-10. 

The Panthers rebounded in the
second match of the day when they
won a 2-1 decision over James
Madison College. After some
serious regrouping and a 19-17
defeat in the first game of the
match, the Panthers came back to
win two straight games 15-8 and
15-10.

Pitt met North Carolina State in
the third match of the day and
recorded another win after games
of 15-10 and 16-14. The final match
of the regular match schedule had
the Panthers pitted against the
University of Pennsylvania. Penn

had just defeated Penn State in a
2-0 contest. The match began with
a 15-12 Panther victory before Pitt
dropped a 15-8 decision to put both
teams into the decisive third game.
A win would have sent the
Panthers into a three-way tie for
first place in their group, a loss
would force Pitt out of the
tournament.

The score was knotted four times

in the closing moments of the
match. Some controversial officia-
ting forced coach Mike Hebert off
his seat to discuss the calls.
Hebert’s move incited the official
to penalize Pitt with a red card,
thus giving Penn a point. After
tieing at 10, 12, 13 and 14 the
Panthers lost the match, 16-14
score.

“The team played well all
throughout the tournament, espec-
ially in the final match against
Penn,” said Hebert. “That had to
be their best match of the whole
season.

“Everyone played well through-
out the day,” he said. “I thought
Arnie (Matthews) had a good
tourney, he played the best match
of the "season against Penn,
blocking better than ever before.”

Hebert went on to give all the
starters credit for their perfor-
mances along with Craig Kowalski
who “came into play halfway
through the day to do a ﬁne job in
the hitting position.”

Jeff Beavers, setter for the
Panthers along with Scott Robbins,

agreed that Pitt had put in its’ best

in this tournament,” said Beavers.
“We had a good defensive effort
and the team played a good all
around game.”

Captain Scott Hoffman agreed.
“As a team we played well, we
pulled together and made many
comebacks throughout the day,

Now that the Panthers have
completed their freshman season
as a Pitt varsity team, they look
forward to their followup year:

‘‘I’m looking forward to next
year,” said Beavers. “We have a
year behind us and we know what

to look forward to and how much
work goes into having a winning
team.”

Hoffman, the only Panther
senior, said, “This season was like
a yo-yo, we were up and down all
season long. We had a stretch
there where we won three out of

ﬁve of our matches and we looked
strong. ‘ - *
“Our problem was that we just
couldn't maintain a high all the
time. I’m sure that we all learned a
lot from this season; you learn
something in each match.
“It was enjoyable.”

(Continued from page 16)

“I had mononucleosis as a
freshman and was redshirted,”
Boyle explained. “Then, I had
shoulder surgery. Last season my
shoulder would tighten upland up
on me and I didn’t pitch well.”

Boyle’s record last season was
2-4.

added. “I’m looking forward to

player George “Doc” Medich.
Now a pitcher for the major league
Texas Rangers, Medich pursued a
medical career while pitching for
the Panthers.

Boyle is also interested in a
professional baseball career.

the minor leagues for awhile,” the

junior said, adding, however, that

Did you know
we can had
a breast cancer
as small as the
head of a pm?

 

Such a tiny cancer can
almost always be cured.
Mammography, a technique
of low-dose breast x-ray, can
detect a cancer long before a
lump can be felt. While it is
still highly curable.

If you are over 50_or
have special reasons to be
concerned with breast
cancer, ask your doctor
about mammography.

They’re
  Fighting
fr is Life.

Each year heart attack
accounts for over 350,000 deaths.
which occur before thevictim
reaches the hospital. It doesn't
have to be that way.

What is done for a victim within
the first few minutes after a heart
attack may determine survival or
death. Cardiopulmonary
resuscitation (CPR) could make
the difference. And you can
learn it.

Some day, with CPR, you could
save a iite. Some day, your own
life could depend on it.

CPR is a basic lite-saving
technique, performed after a
person has suffered “cardiac
arrest" — that is, after the heart
has stopped beating. It provides ‘
emergency life support until more
advanced support is available,’
through a combination of chest
compression and mouth-to-mouth
breathing.

Trained instructors, certified by
the American Heart Association,
can teach you CPR. It takes
several hours. It could mean a
lifetime.

Contact your local Heart
Association for more information
on this program.
