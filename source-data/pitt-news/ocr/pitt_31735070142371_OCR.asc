Pitt snaps 31- game home winning streak

Kyle Craig
Staff Writer

The Big East ﬁnally caught up
with the No. 9 Pittsburgh Pan-
thers.

A 27-point effort by George-
town guard Chris Wright helped
the No. 11 Hoyas snap Pitt’s 31-
game home winning streak and
handed the Panthers’ their ﬁrst
conference loss of the season,
74-66. .

In a game with 11 lead changes,
Wright’s layup with 1:14 left in the
second half and one second left
on the shot clock stretched the
Hoya lead to eight and squashed a
possible Panther comeback.

“Chris made plays. We have
different guys on different’
nights,” Georgetown coachjohn
Thompson III said. “Tonight just
happened to be Chris’ night.”

While Wright excelled, Pitt
guard Ashton Gibbs struggled.
As Pitt’s leading scorer this sea-
son, Gibbs entered last night’s
game averaging 17.5 points but
shot just 3 of 16 from the ﬁeld,
managing eight points against
the Hoya defense.

“We just needed somebody
else to step up,” Pitt forward
Gilbert Brown said. “Today we
didn’t have somebody else pick
it upand we kind of fell short as
a team.” -

Still, the Panthers (15-3, 5-1
Big East) had a two-point lead ‘
with less than ten minutes re-
maining in the second half,

thanks in large part to the ca-
reer-high. 20 points that Brown
scored off of the bench. However,
a nine-point run with seven min-
utes remaining, gave Georgetown
(14-3, 5-2) a lead that it would not
relinquish.

A win last night would have
given the Panthers their ﬁrst
6-0 start to league play in school
history — an achievement that
could have been startling con-
sidering Pitt was picked to ﬁnish
ninth in Big East by the confer-
ence’s coaches. _

Pitt’s failure to set a new con-
ference mark was attributed to
defensive lapses in crucial situa-
tions. Wright’s shot clock—beating
layup and another 3—pointer by
the junior coming out of a tim-
eout with 6:24 left in the game,
highlighted defects in the Pan-
ther defensive effort.

“We had a lot of letdowns the
last couple games in our defense.

we do [best] ,” Brown said.

The numbers illustrate Brown’s
sentiment. Georgetown shot 70
percent from 3-point range and V

way to a 22.2 percent success rate
from beyond the arc.

“I thought we could have
played better. [I] hadn’t felt we
defended as well as we need

caught up to us tonight as we
didn’t shoot it well,” Pitt coach
Jamie Dixon said. V

summonedtoprove they completed 50
hours of community service as part of
a deal cut with the district attomey’s
olﬁce.

Together they chatted quietly, re-
counting the circumstances of their
G-20 arrests and sharing expectations
about the upcoming hearings.

Public defenders scurried in and
outofthe room, carryingstacks ofma-
nilatrialfolders, urgingtheir clientsto
be patient until Disttictjudge Kevin
Cooper took the stand just before 9
am. Itwas nearlyanhour alter defen-
dants were instructed to report to the
Pittsburgh Municipal Court building.

“Everybody just seems to be tak-
ing their grand old time,” Pitt Sl1ld€nt
Anthony Brino said before the pro-
ceedings commenced. “No one seems
exactly surewhatis goingon. I guess we

justproveourserviceandthatwillbeit. ‘

I’m hoping this is the last step.”

Brino’s prediction turned out to
be about right. In slightly less than
an hour, all but two of about 90 de-
fendants had their charges dropped.
Final ﬁgures were not available as of
press time, but Pittsburgh Municipal
Court Administrator Angharad Stock
conﬁrmed that of about 130 people
who accepted community service in
exchange for having their charges
lessened or dropped, about 100 took
the offer.

Essentially, everyone who took
community service ﬁnished their
hours, she said.

“We haven’t put together a deﬁni-
tive count yet, but it looks like a vast
majority of those who opted into the
program completed their 50 hours,”
Stock told The Pitt News Wednesday
evening.

that  chaos.
“We’ve been through this before,

, for our preliminary hearings back in

October. Now allwe have to do is show
thatwe’ve completed ourhours. That’s
easy,” Essig, a Pitt ﬁeshman, said.

Chriestagreed and said hefelt con-
ﬁdent that he would ﬁnally be rid of
“the whole G-20 thing.”

“I mean, check out this fancy let-
terhead,” he said, poinﬁngtothe letter
proving he completed the 50 hours
of service. “We’re sure to get off with
this. I didn’t even bother to dress up
this time.”

The room grew quiet as Cooper
took the bench. He ordered everyone
who had a pending case to stand and
be sworn in, and warned that if any
cell phones or other electronic devices
were seen in use he would order the
sheriff to conﬁscate them.

“I don’twantto see any cell phones,”
Cooper said. “Don’t just turn them to
vibrate. Turn them off and put them
away. And remember, no talkinginthe
courtroom.”

The judge then called each defen-
dantto the bench and quickly read the

chatter seemed to grow above a mild
roar, Cooper looked up and called for
quiet. .
“I realizeyou don’twanttobehere,”

_ he saidto one student, after callingfor

silence. “But communityserviceisnot
about what you want to do, or are go-

ing to enjoy doing. This is a punish- '

ment.” , 4

In spite of the mostly genial pro-
cess, one point of confusion seemed
to arise duringthe mornings proceed-
ings: Even though their charges were
dropped, students are still responsible
for paying court fees. The fees range
from $113 to $200, depending on
which charges the district attorneys
voﬂice originally ﬁled, Cooper said.

“I believe it was made clear dur-
ing the preliminary hearing process
that all of you would be responsible
for paying courtfees,” Cooper said. “If
you can’t pay the fees today, you must
let me know, [or] else you will get yet
another subpoena.”

The cases moved forward steadily,
and by 10:00 a.m., only a smattering
of defendants remained in the court-
room.

US clears adoption of-

8 Haitian orphans

Lindsay Carroll
Assistant News Editor

Some of me orphans who arrived in
Pittsburgh from Haiti yesterday will
ﬁnally be able to join their adoptive
families. a

The U.S. Department oﬂ-Iomeland
Security cleared eight of the children
for adoption by ﬁve 

The others continue to wait for the

. department to expedite the immigra-

tion process for them, Megan Darda-

nell, a spokeswoman for Allegheny A

County, said.

Their ﬁnalized adoptions come
after a collaboration of the families
with politicians, charities, UPMC and
local ofﬁcials to bring the children
to Pittsburgh from Haiti. Because of
the devastation in Haiti, Homeland
Security is working to expedite the
adoptions for these families, most of
whom began the process prior to last
Tuesday’s earthquake.

Fifty-three of the children arrived I

at Pittsburgh International Airport
on Tuesday morning. Local ofﬁcials
transported them to the Children’s
Hospital ofPittsburgh_ofUPMC, where

they received medicalexamsand other

  

  

pital for her medical examination and
went through the same process as the
other children. Emma got temporarily

‘ lost in Haiti andjamie McMutrie Heck-

man, whorunsthe Haitian orphanage
with her sister, waited theretoﬁnd her
and bring her to Pittsburgh. g

None of those waiting to adopt are
from the Pittsburgh area, Dardanell
said. Most ofthemareAmericans ﬁnm
allover the count1y—- places like Md.,
Wash, Kan., and Colo. One family is
from Pa, another is from Spain and
more are from Canada.

Dardanell said there is no estimate
of how long it will take to process the
rest of the orphans for adoption.

“The goal here, obviously, is to get
themwiththeirﬁunilies as soon as pos-
sible,” she said. »

Part" of the issue, Dardanell said, .

is that the children and their adoptive

families are in different steps of the -

adoption process.

Dardanell said many people have
called the county asking about dona-
tions, adoption and foster care for the
Haitian children. People who want to
help can visit the county website at al-

Hasty over
Haitians

uesday morning provided

a glimpse of light and hap:

piness in a story beset with
tragedy. Fifty—three young Haitian
orphans landed safely in Pittsburgh,
away from the destruction of their
country and into American arms.
New families will — hopefully soon
— be able to adopt the children.

Upon landing, the tired children
were taken to Children’s Hospital
of Pittsburgh of UPMC to undergo
medical examinations. Fortunately,
allwere free of signiﬁcant illness and
were provided homey rooms in the
hospital to stay in until their adop-
tion or foster-home arrangements
are ﬁnalized. '

The children’s arrival proved
a spectacle with abundant media
coverage by local and national news
agencies. These children are arriving
from an orphanage operated by two
sisters from Pittsburgh, Jamie and
Ali McMutrie. Still, the optimism
of this story resonates on a national
level. _

Amid the spectacle, UPMC’s hos-
pitality was evident. But the hospital
remained focused on the national
spotlight. While it held general press
conferences, UPMC spoke directly
with only national media.

UPMC recently closed its long-
standing Braddock hospital, citing
low patient admittance and inade-

. quate revenue — a move that caused

controversy regarding job losses and

the hospital’s pivotal role in the com— _

munity. It seems UPMC had a chance
to redeem —— shine, even —- in the
national spotlight. While taking in
the Haitian orphans was an act of

N charity, it was also a very sound po-

litical move. _ .
More orphaned Haitians will
make their way to Pittsburgh and

other cities in the ‘ﬁxture. as willing, 5

open arms seek to provide new
homes. Those 53 children were
quickly brought here after the U.S.
eased its policy on visa requirements
on Monday, thus allowing quick ref-
uge and transport for the Haitian

orphans.

Thousands more children have
been orphaned by the quake’s de-
struction, and there’s sure to be an
inﬂux of families seeking to adopt
Haitian orphans. But despite the
success story of those 53 children,

the process must be carried out care- _

fully. Those 53 children were already
on Haiti’s government’s list of 900
known orphans. Although there are
now thousands of orphans, there are
certainly some families that have
been separated in the wake of the
disaster. ’ A

As part of the reduced visa re-
quirements, the U.S. has agreed to let

. in children who were partnered with

American families for adoption but
had not been given aﬁnal okay from
Haitian officials. The process typi-
cally takes three years because‘ the
government is cautious — as U.N.
officials have pointed out, not all of
the approximately 200 orphanages
in Haiti are legitimate, and there is
potential for child trafﬁcking, ac-
cording to The New York Times.
It seems other countries will also
look into adopting orphans. Some,
of the prospective adopting fami-

lies of those 53 children are from I

Canada and Spain, according to the
Pittsburgh Post— Gazette.

No doubt the conditions in Haiti
are deplorable and still unsafe -——
and not justin regard to desperate
locals becoming violent. Just yes-

terday a 5.9 magnitude aftershock '

trembled Haiti’s already razed build-
ings and broken ground causing a
tremor offright and uneaseinlocals.
Temporary housing outside of the
country — alternatively, a group of
Catholic leaders suggested orphans
be housed in Southern Florida -
would be a response for the moment.-

But the.,stil1.critical.situation,.. .

efforts should be focused on ﬁrst
trying to reunite families and fur-
ther stabilizing the country while
organizations take time to ensure
the safety of the situations children
may enter. '

Affair causes political unrest

Northern Ireland’s government unstable over leader ’s adulterous unlfe

 
  
 

Mark Kozlowski
Columnist

Sex has a way of making the news,
especially when the one partaking
in it does so without beneﬁt of mar-
riage but with the beneﬁt of fame.
Politicians know this well, because
when one of them gets caught with
their trousers down, it tends to elicit

I comments.

Comments are particularly prev-
alent when a politician is discov-
ered cheating on another prominent
politician.

"Northern Ireland has been
blighted by a scandal recently as
word got out that a prominent -
and prominently moralizing -
politician had been cheating on her
husband, while securing a large loan

~so herlover could start a coffee shop. ' '

At least we haven’t found $90,000
cash stuffed in afreezer or, as would
be more apt, a Bun-o-matic.

One small problem. '

Iris Robinson, an ex-member of
Parliament, happens to have been
unfaithful to none other than the

‘First Minister of the Northern Irish

government, Peter Robinson. Peter
apparently knew ofthe ﬁnancial she-
nanigans and did nothing. Hence,
he’s not only been cuckolded, but
also embroiled in the scandal. The
ﬁrst minister has “temporarily”
stood aside, and the unity govern-
ment so painstakingly put in place
in the troubled region several years
ago appears to be in jeopardy. The

_ Protestant Democratic Unionist

Party, of which Robinson was head,
is in disarray. This all comes at avery
critical time for the province.

The parliament’ of Northern
Ireland is in the middle of trying
to transfer police authority for the
province from the United Kingdom
to a local authority, according to

the Belfast Telegraph. This is messy‘  '

because the Unionists are afraid too
much Catholic control of the police
could lead to biased policing. The
Catholics, on the other hand, are

fully aware that Protestant control
of the police already led to some
rather cozy arrangements between
Unionist paramilitaries and the
police during The Troubles of the
1970s. »

Meanwhile, while most of the
Irish Republican Army (IRA) has

disarmed, a splinter group calling it- '

selfthe Real IRA has recently staged
a few minor attacks reminiscent of
the bad old days, apparently‘hop-
ing to reignite the conﬂict between.
Protestants and Catholics. Perhaps
the most effective way to combat
this problem would be a truly uni-
ﬁed police force composed of Prot-
estants and Catholics standing to-

‘ gether againstterrorism. However,
the sex scandalis not making the ,-

creation of that force any easier.
And since the hand over of po-

licing has been bogged down, the

rnaiﬁ'Catholic'party,‘ Sinn‘ Feiri, has

gotten increasingly impatient and '

angry. The Belfast Telegraph reports

that they’ve gotten so steamed that -

there are distinct fears that the en-

tire unity government of Northern
Ireland is in danger.

In the past, many of the prov-
ince’s gulfs have been bridged by
the constant cooperation between
the United Kingdom and the Re-
public of Ireland. However, right
now both of those governments
are distracted. Ireland’s economy
tanked in the latest downturn, and
its government is under a lot of pres-
sure to pick it up again. Fianna Fail,
the party in power, looks wobbly.
Across the Irish Sea, the U,K. has

to hold elections sometime before
June 3 of this year, according to The
Irish Times. It appears likely that
the Labour Party will lose its hold
on power. There have even been
attempts, so far unsuccessful, to
change the government before
those elections. Some Labour MPs
already attempted to remove the
prime minister. One way or another,
the U.K.’s Irish policy might undergo
a shift very soon.

The situation is critical. If Sinn
Fein does pull out of the govern-

ment, we could see a slow buildup
of tension, and then a gradual return
to the bloodletting that character-
ized Northern Ireland in the past.
Why should we care? It took
years of poking, prodding, pleading
and politicking to make this govern-
ment and perhaps ﬁnally end the
violence for which Northern Ireland
was so famous. It was a remarkable
achievement, especially in a world
fullof Somalias, Yugoslavias and
Palestines, in a world of long-run-
ning conﬂicts that don’t tend to end

peacefully.

With the British and Irish likely
distracted, it’s high time the United
States gets involved, to the extent
that it is possible. We have histori-

, cal and ethnic ties to Ireland and

the Irish Independence movement,
yet are considered British allies. We
have a history of mediation in the
region, particularly through George
Mitchell. Furthermore, President
Obama is a symbol of a nation
overcoming past racial difficulties,
which makes him uniquely quali-

ﬁed to weigh in. The United States
needs to support Irish and British
efforts to resolve the complicated
conflict over the police, and ensure
that whatever steps are being taken
survive the changes of government.
After all, we will have foreign policy
continuity at least through 2012.
The time to act is now, so that The
Troubles do not trouble Northern
Ireland again.

Google between a rock and a hard place

Search engine must provide compromised service to Chinese customers O1’fOTflt lucrative market I

 
     

Donald Campbell
Columnist

A good number of people in the Unit-
ed States would say that Google is
their search engine of choice.

This, of course, puts Google in
a position to heavily inﬂuence the
shape of our Internet activities.

It can help us ﬁnd information,
organize our e-mail, and navigate
through our documents.

One of the main reasons for this
inﬂuence has been the openness
with which Google claims to operate
— according to the Google Code of
Conduct, “don’t be evil” is Google’s
unofficial motto.

Google had a bit of a dilemma,
however, when it decided to make
a sweeping business choice and
provide search features to China, a
country known for restricting access
to Internet information it deems un-
savory.

The response to Google’s deci-
sion to enter China, along with its
requisite decision to abide by Chi-
nese ﬁlter and censorship laws, was
understandably mixed. : ' »

Some praised Googlefor going
after the millions of new custom-

ers China provided. Others simply
pointed out that compliance with
censorship was seemingly at odds
with Google’s previously professed
ideals.

And then came an even bigger
problem — Google was hacked.

After Google discovered that it
was hacked, the AP reported that
Google is “no longer willing to con-_

tough exclamation that it would
no longer ﬁlter search results, and

_ was consideringleavingthe Chinese .

market altogether.

Not so fast, though. Both Google _
and the Chinese government are
down playing Google’s announce-.

ment of an imminent pullout.

The Reuters article, “Google cle- 
nies leaving China, seeks jfnegotia-i

cn.” ’

The company even went; so far’

as to threaten a complete iiullout
of the Chinese market, according
to a Reuters. , ‘ 1 ‘ . ‘
Many were happy with this deci-
sion. In fact, according to the AP,
Google received an “avalanche of
praise” because of its seemingly

tions,” reported that Google would
“try to negotiate a legal unﬁltered

1 4. search engine.” During these nego-

tiations, the Associated Press ar-
ticle notes, Google is continuing to
provide its services to the Chinese
market with all previous ﬁlters in
place.
‘ So what is next for Google?
Reuters notes that the Chinese

 

government has appeared open to
negotiations, but is adamant that

Google will have to abide by Chinese

laws as they currently stand.

I, " This assertion would make it

appear that Google’s ability to ne-

gotiate is rather small, and that it

must continue to censor if it wants
.-tocontinue offering products to the

become louder.

Google, for its lot, could see ide-
alistic beneﬁt in both leaving and
staying. Google’s entrenchment
in the Chinese market provides
access to information for China’s
many Internet users that would not
be available otherwise, and is thus
beneﬁcial.

According to The New York
Times, Google’s exit from the Chi-

nese marketwould be seen as disas-
trous to many of Google’s Chinese
customers. »

international community,”
Strong said, who recognized the
immediate need following the
devastation in Haiti. “If there’s
a way to support, we’re going to
do it,” he said. .
After eight hours of back-and-
forth texting conversations, Man
Dee and Strong had a plan. They
would host a local Haiti earth-
quake benefit concert at Shadow
Lounge, charge a $10 donation
at the door and give the cover
charge and 10°/o of the bar sales

to the Yele Haiti’s earthquake re-

‘ lief fund, which was founded by

Wyclefjean. Man Dee now had
the idea, the location and the do-
nation strategy. She just needed
performers; I

It didn’t take much time for
her to find a lineup.

“I just made some phone calls,
and before I knew it, all these
wonderful entertainers were on
board,” Man Dee said.

This band of entertainment
includes Seanjones, pianist and

vocalistjoy Ellis and the George-
town Trio, bassist Tony DePa—
olis, D] Flex, poet Christiane D.,
singer-songwriter Joy Ike and

Michael Glabicki and his band ‘ I

Rusted Root, among others.

Ike, who volunteered at a Hai-
tian orphanage years ago, was in
disbelief when she heard about
the earthquake in Haiti.

“It didn’t seem real until I
turned on my computer, read
about it, saw the pictures and
then saw a news story on TV a

Since then, 100% of online sales from
Ike’s merchandise —‘ CDs, T-shirts, stick-
ers, etc. — have been donated to Food
for the Poor, another international relief
assistance corporation. “All purchases
at [tonight’s] benefit will go to Yele,” Ike
added. “I want people to have my music,
but I also want to help.”

Glabicki, front man of the Pittsburgh P
_ native band Rusted Root, accepted as soon
as Man Dee called to ask him to perform .

“It was the first thing that came up,’_’
Glabicki said, who was wondering at the

‘ ' ”“We’re all one,” he said of Haitians,
Americans and other nationalities. “If
there is ‘any kindof painor hurt in others

 "In sync with Glabick/i’sthought to send

with the title “Sending Backthe Spirit”

' “Effects of Haiti’s culture and art can
be seen in so many different places around
the world,”-Man Dee continued, explaining
that despite Haiti’s small size, its spirit has
an international and eternal presence. “I
thought that Pittsburgh, as a vibrant and

artistic community ourselves, could send.

our [spirit] back to them,” she said. “It’s
going to be a phenomenal night of music
and phenomenal entertainers.”

Mani‘ Dee hopes to raise “a couple
grand” at Thursday’s beneﬁt. and insists
that every little bit helps. She remains
confused by those who have yet to assist
in this cause.

“I don’t—get it. It’s so easy -to help people .

in need. We’re supposed to be compas-
sionate people,” she said, emphasizing
the basic human compulsion “to help your
fellow man when he or she is in need.”
Pittsburgh businesses have given dona-
tions to be raffled off in the Blue Room of
Shadow Lounge during the beneﬁt. The

cluding sophomore center Greg
Monroe, who also pulled in 11
rebounds. And Georgetown man-
aged 74 points, while only get-

The loss moves the Panther
into a tie with Syracuse for sec-
ond place in the Big East trailing
Villanova. The conference sched-
ule will continue this Sunday
when Pitt travels to play Seton
Hall. '

Seniorjermaine Dixon under-

stands the necessity to put last
night’s contest in the rear-view
mirror and move on to the next
game.

When asked what the first con-
ference loss meant, the guard’s

-. answer was simple: “Nothing. We V
have a long way to go. We’ve got a '

lot of games left. This is a tough
conference. One loss doesn’t
mean anything.”

Notes: Brad Wanamaker ﬁn-
ished one point shy of a double-
double, scoring nine points while

amassing 13 rebounds and seven

The Panthers women, who en-

' the Bulls with four consecutive

Big East losses, desperately
needed a win in South Florida last
night to keep their NCAA tourna-

sent the Panthers searching for
their first conference win. ~
South Florida (11-7, 2-3 Big

the tip-off as they held the lead
throughout the entire game.

Arenas jumps the gun

Acting on impulses, Arenas haunted by hubris

 

Evan Burgos
Staﬁ" Writer

 

When GilbertArenas declared for the NBA Draft
in 2001 as a combo guard out of the University
of Arizona, he was sure he would be drafted in
the ﬁrst round, which would guarantee him mil-
lions of dollars.

Like anyone about to become a millionaire
overnight, Arenas went on a spending spree.
His biggest toy? A Cadillac Escalade equipped
with $50,000 in extrafeatures, includinga new
sound system, four TVs, a six—disc DVD player,
22-inchrims and asecurity camera mounted on
the rearbumper. '

But the whole deal hit a snag. Arenas ended
up being selected in the second round, inking a
contract for the modest sum of $845,252 to be
paid over two years. After taxes and agent fees,
Arenas’ purchase of the Escalade turned out to
be abit morethanhe could afford. ’

Asittumed out, Arenas didn’tthink the whole
thing through. ’ .

Inthe subsequent eightyears, Arenas became
a model citizen in the NBA. He’s been smart on
the court and ﬁnancially frugal. He has made
good decisions. It paid off—— literally — when
in 2008 Arenas signed his biggest contract to
date: a six-year, $111 million deal.

Aside from some injuries, things were going
well for Arenas. Until recently, when yet again,
Arenas didn’t quite think things through and
pulled the trigger (pun intended) on another i]l— —
conceived decision. Arenas allegedly stored four

 Campus
Gilbert Arenas is no role model.

unlicensed, unloaded weapons inthe Washington
Wizards locker room and reportedly threatened
teammatejavaris Crittenton. For his part, Crit-
tenton retorted byﬂauntingaweapon ofhis own,
according to a Washington Post report.

Iknow the giddy purchaseofaﬂashy car and
ﬂashing a gun aren’t one and the same. And, in
Arenas’ defense, this isprobably not the ﬁrst time
inthehistory ofpro sports thatagtmhas made its

way into a locker room. But it is the ﬁrst time it’s 1

been reported, and Arenaswas the athlete stupid
enough to actually tote the weapon.

But what does this whole ﬁasco say about
professional athletes in general? Duringhis play-
ing days, NBA Hall of Famer Charles Barkley
famously proclaimed that he is nota role model.
Barkley preferred to leave that distinction to
parents, teachers and the like.

Many disputed his claim, insistingthat there
is an inherent quality of being a public ﬁgure
that, whether accepted or not, bestows the re-
sponsibility to serve as a proper role model for
society’s youth. A

, In theory, that argument seems valid. But
th_ere’s one glaringproblem: athletes consistently
act in ways that disallow the general public to
arbitrarily hold them on a high pedestal simply
because they are famous. In aworldwhere Tiger
Woods has multiple mistresses, Kobe Bryant
was accused of sexual assault, Michaeljordan
is a degenerate gambler and Michael Phelps is
taking bong rips, why should anyone expect
anything exceptional from. these guys outside
of their athletic careers?

Statistics against Pitt

ledher team with 22 points, while three
other South Florida players scored more
than 10 points.

Ball control and turnovers have been
a recent problem for the Panthers, but in
this game, capitalizing off South Florida
errors was more of an issue. The Panthers
committed only 14 turnovers in compari-
son to South Florida’s 17, but the offensive
accuracy was not present for Pitt.

The shooting woes carried overto the
Panther’s performance behind the arc and
at the free-throw line as well. i

The Panthers attempted 19 long-range ' , .
. shots, but only converted four. In addition,

Pitt barely crossed the 50 percent mark‘
for free throw shooting percentage.

A One other "statistic .that"truly repre-
sents the Panthers’ struggle, especially
against South Florida, was the difference
in defensive rebounds. The Bulls pulled in
34 rebounds on the defensive end while
Pitt managed 19.

This disparity in rebounding perfor-
mance gave the Bulls a big advantage in
their offensive transition game, while
severely limiting the Panthers’ second-
chance opportunities.

athlete to follow, but he’s never had it in full per-

of Barkley, and how pertinent his claims seem
to be.
