Attorney-General Homer Cummings Accepts Pitt ODK

Golden Panthers Primed
For Tomorrow’s “Grudge”
Contest With Notre Dame

 

Irish Ready For Revenge
Following Last Year’s
Upset At Stadium

 

Pitt Lineup Uncertain

Tomorrow afternoon at South Bend,
Indiana, the Golden Cats of Jock
Sutherland and the Irish of Hunk Au-
derson will clash in a. battle which
will be featured by the attempt of
both teams to regain some of the
prestige they lost when they were de-
feated last Saturday.

The Panthers went into last week's
game with Minnesota riding on a
wave of victory, which had carried
them through three games undefeated
and untied. Notre Dame Went into
the Carnegie Tech game undefeated.
Now with last week's defeats still
fresh in mind both teams will be out
to rehabilitate themselves in the eyes
of their respective supporters, There
will be no such thing as over-conﬁ-
dance in the game tomorrow.

Add to this the fact that the
Pant.hers defeated the Ramblers in
one of the biggest football upsets of
last season and you can be sure that
Notre Dame will be out for blood and
revenge.

Not at all satisﬁed with the play-
ing of his team in the Minnesota
game, Coach Sutherland has dras-
tically shaken up the Panther lineup.
“Mike” Sebastian, All—American pros-
pect of the past two years. has been
removed from his right halfback post
and “Dick” Matesic substituted.
Weinstock will start at fullback _in
place of Weisenbaugh and Meredith
has been moved back to his old post
at left tackle replacing Hoel, who
started the Minnesota game. A sur-
prise was the decision of Coach Suth-
erland to use “Bobby” Hogan. I‘eg111‘-31‘
quarterback for three years, at center,
if necessary. George Shotwell will
probably start Saturday’s game. at the
pivot post in place of the injured
Kliskey, but Hogan will be held in
readiness to replace him. Hogan will
also be ready to enter the game to
replace Munjas at quarterback.

The center position is not a new
one for Hogan, He played there
throughout his high school career at
Meadville, Pa., and also had some ex-
perience at this position in his fresh-
man year here. Whether
center or quarterback he will proba-
bly back up the line, and this, inci-
dentally, is where he stands out.

Several things might help the
Panthers’ cause tomorrow. Among
others, if Hogan, Walton, Skladany.
Onder, and Sebastian are able to rise
to the heights as they did last year
against the Irish, Pitt’s chances for
victory will be much greater. How-
ever, should they play the uninspired
ball that has characterized the
Panthers part of the time this year
they are in for a beating,

Coach Sutherland will in all proba-
bility not name his team captain un-
til just before game time. Nick
Lukats, senior halfback, has been
named by Hunk Anderson to act as
captain of the Irish.

The Notre Dame team will probably
lineup with Vairo and Devore at the
ends, Krause and Roach at the
tackles, \Vunsch and Pivarnik at the
guards, German at center, Mazziotti
at quarterback, Lukats and Brancheau
at the halves, and Elser at fullback.
Incidentally, these are NOT the shock
troops.

The game tomorrow will be the
seventh between Pitt and Notre Dame
teams. Last year the Panthers won

 

, for the ﬁrst time. In 1911 they played

a tie with the Irish. Notre Dame
scored victories in 1909, 1912, 1930,
and 1931.

The Panther gridders left last night
for Niles, Michigan, a 15-mile trip
from South Bend, where they will
stay in seclusion until game time.
They will, however, go to the Notre
Dame stadium this afternoon for a
ﬁnal workout,

new developments in industry con-
tributed by the University’s scientiﬁc
research unit,

“The Sculfability of Shoes," an arti-
cle by Carl H, Geister, Industrial Fel-

Confer With Pitt

Student Councils of Tech,
Duquesne Send Men Here To
Discuss Lower Trolley Rates

Foster Greater Amity

Conferring together for the ﬁrst
time, representatives of the Student
Councils of Carnegie Tech, Duquesne
and Pitt met in the Cathedral Wed-
nesday evening,

From Tech came Shorey Allan,
president, and Neal Sparks, a mem-
ber of the Plaid group. Duquesne
sent Jack Roche, secretary, and Ken-
neth Duffy, a member of the Duke
Student Senate, and Pitt’s Council
was represented by Jack McParland,
D34, president, James Danahey, C34,
an“(i Scott Turner, E34.

Possible reduction of trolley fare
for students was the main business of
the meeting, which had been called
by Pitt for greater intercollegiate co-
operation. Turner was elected chair-
man, and will take charge of the
work for decreased car rates.

“We shall meet with the heads of
the schools,” 'l‘urner said after the
meeting, “to discuss the feasibility of
this move from an administrative
standpoint, In two weeks we shall
meet again to compare notes, after
our respective student bodies have
been canvassed. Then we plan to
take up the proposition with the
Pittsburgh Railways company.”

Reduced fare was a salient feature
in Council's eleven-point program an-
nounced early this semester. At
Wednesdays meet, a conservative
estimate placed the number of Pitts-
burgh college students using the trol-
leys at 7500, "This, when multiplied
by ten to twenty car checks 3. week,”

 

declared Danahey, "represents a big‘

item. Some sort of reduction for stu-
dents should be provided.”

tee, announced at the Notre Dame pep

electric light w ‘ch was shown last]

week, but will al‘ 0' include a running
comment on t game. Monday
Danahey, expecti a, paid attendance,
estimated that 500 students would
attend. With no admission charged,
he now predicts, ?.‘a full house.”
Either your at ,letic book or your

Arthur Stroyd, C36, chairman of the
Sophomore Hop, to lead the Grand

will among the schools, the combined , Rug-u,-31 bans have accorded it in this
group decided to sponsor a dinner ; country,

meeting later in the year at which
deans of men and women and council
members from the three universities
will be present.

Allan, Tech representative, ex-
pressed regret to McParland that the
Tech student body had violated the
Pitt-Tech agreement Monday in invad-
ing the Pitt campus. “VVe tried to
stop them from coming over,” he said,
“but we just couldn’t.”

“Your group did no damage what-
soever,” McParland replied. “In fact,
instead of sending you the usual let-
ter reminding you of our agreement,
we have sent you a note congratulat-
ing you on your victory over Notre
Dame.”

Newman Players’ Series
Includes Six Productions

A series of six plays will be pre-
sented during the winter by the New-
man Players of the Newman club,
Catholic student group. After being
Presented before the club, the plays
will be given at other places in the
city.

The players are divided into senior
and junior groups according to ex-
perience. Members of the senior
group who attend Pitt are: Frank
Delaney, Richard Kennedy, and Ray
Schwan.

Mrs, Madeline Skelly Foust is di-
rector of the players and Rev, C. A.
Sawlerbeck is advisor to the club.

i

Specht has also played for two pre-
vious University dances, the Pan-
hellenic ball last semester, and the
Junior Prom of two years ago. He
hasibeen credited with scoring tre-
mendous hits on both occasions. His
most recent long-term engagement
has been at the Century of Progress
in Chicago where he followed Ben
Bernie’s orchestra at the Casino.

The traditional Grand March of
next week's dance will take place at
11 o'clock and the novel programs
conceived by the committee will be
distributed at that time. Details of
the program are still secret, although
Stroyd intimates that it will follow
an altogether new idea. Favors were
not given out at the Hop last year
nor at the Senior Ball in June, and,
so far, no mention has been made

concerning their presence at the class ,

of 1936 affair. -

Tickets have been on sale since
Monday at .$2.50 per couple, the lowest
price ever set for the Hop, They
may be purchased from members of
the committee and in the oiiice of the
dean of men. The sale t'o date has
proved more than satisfactory, ac-
cording__ to the chairman.

University Alumni Association
Continues Activities For
Vital Bond Issue

 

Urges Student Interest

 

“No matter how much business ini-
proves, there will be at least 300,000
families dependent on public relief in
Pennsylvania this winter,” stated
Arthur Dunham, president of Public
Charities association of Pennsylvania
in a letter to J. W. Hallock, secretary
of the General Alumni association,
who is directing Pitt’s part in the
campaign for the passing of Amend-
ment 8.

A speakers’ bureau of University
men has been set up for propagating
the facts of the existing relief issue
at various meetings throughout the
city, These men are: James C.
Charlesworth, instructor in political
science; Dr. Marion K. McKay, head
of the department of economics; Dr.
Francis D. Tyson, professor of eco-
nomics; Dr, George K. McCabe, as-
sistant professor of economics; Dean
E. A Holbrook, dean of the School of
Engineering and School of Mines; Dr.
Elmer I). Graper, head of the depart-
ment of political science; Dr. L. P.
Sieg, dean of the College and of the
graduate school and acting dean of
the School of Education and professor
;of physics, the College; Dr. 0. H
;Bla.ckwood, professor of physics; Dr.
‘J. ‘W. Oliver, head of the department
of history; Dean 'I‘hyrsa W, Amos.
dean of women; Dr. Florence M. Tea-
garden, professor of psychology; Dr.
Paul J. \Vat1-tins, director of the Bu-
eau of Business Research and Dr.
Vincent W. L-anfear, director of the
rDowntown Division of the University.
2 Mr. Hallock has stated that it will
{be impossible to (if -the bond issue
lfails) raise enough money, let alone
‘over $25,000,000, to provide for the
poor and destitute this winter. By
December 10, at the latest, there will
be widespread suffering and starva-
tion among the unemployed if Amend-
ment 8 does not pass, Relief this
winter depends upon Amendment 8.
State aided hospitals, of which there
are 22 in Allegheny county alone,
will be crippled in giving free service
to the poor.

While state-aided schools, such as
Pitt, will receive nothing directly
from the bond issue, however, if the
bond issue fails, there will be a
further cut in the state-aid of $396,-
000. This loss, according to Chancel-
lor Bowman will seriously cripple the
school's service to the community for

years to come.
Not only will relief work, state
aided hospitals and schools suffer,

but the taxpayers will be faced with
a tax to raise the $25,000,000, It will
be impossible, by any method of tax-
ation, to raise enough money to take
care of state welfare after the pres-
ent funds are exhausted by December
10, until March 1, at the earliest.

Alpha Kappa Psi Sponsors
November Lunch Groups

Beginning November 7, a series of
luncheon discussions of every day
business problems. sponsored by Al-
pha Kappa Psi, professional business
men’s fraternity, will be presented at
the Fort Pitt hotel, room 719, from 12
to 1 o’clock.

At the ﬁrst luncheon a representa-
tive of the Carnegie Steel company

in steel credit.

Homer Stille Cummings, attorney-
general of the United States, will be
tapped into the Gamma circle of
Omicron Delta. Kappa at the fall
tapping ceremonies here early in De-
cember.

This announcement, made public by
the Pitt group yesterday, comes as a
result of an invitation given by the
organization several weeks ago. Gen-
eral Cummings’ acceptance, which
reached here Wednesday, was sent to
John P. Bracken, C34, president of
ODK.

Bracken and James Danahey, C34,
visited the ca.pital early this month,
and returned with news that “A mem-

,ber of President Roosevelt's cabinet

will soon be tapped ODK.” Lack of
official conﬁrmation at the time pre-
vented announcement of the tappee‘s
name.

Upon receipt of Mr. Cummings’ ac-

, Attorney Cummings, who was ap-
;pointed to his present post March 4
[upon the death of Thomas J. Walsh,
was born in Chicago in 1870. After
receiving his degree of IL, B. from
Yale in 1893, he was admitted to the
bar, and began his practice in Con-
necticut. He was elected mayor of
Stamford, Connecticut, for three terms
in succession, and has been several
times Democratic national committee-
nian from Connecticut.

Since taking ofiice, Mr. Cummings
has begun prosecutions against gold
hoarders, has supervised the legal
workings of the NRA, and has opened
a nationwide war against crime. As
a result of his crime drive, convic-
tions have been obtained in import-
ant kidnapping cases in the Mid‘-
West, a.nd a new penal island for fed‘-
eral prisoners has been established in
San Francisco bay.

Mr. Cummings’ letter of acceptance

The Spirit’s There!

: HE PEP ASSEMBLY in Memorial Hall on Wednes- '

day proved one thing conc1usively—that there IS
“school -spirit” on the Pitt campus. Following a defeat
of the football team at the hands of Minnesota last Sat-
-urday, the students rallied behind a team that tomorrow
faces one of the toughest ﬁghts of the season. The stu-
dents stood and cheered Jock Sutherland and the Pitt
squad for fully four minutes. They weren't cheering a
“-winning" team—~but a team that can take it!

’Whether or not the team returns from South Bend on
Monday with a victory tucked away doesn't make a par-
ticle of difference to a student body that is convinced
that the team which represents it at South Bend is
-the best team in the country win or lose. It's that sort
of ~spirit——not necessarily the rah-rah-rah type-—that Pitt
‘students showed at the assembly.

Student Council, the body which sponsored the suc-
cessful assembly, and the cheerleaders should imme-
diately begin to plan either for additional assemblies or
for other activities which will continue to bring out Pitt
spirit. The spirit’s there——~let’s get together and get
more of It.

Tear ’Em Down!

. GROUP OF VISITORS TO PITT, admiring the ar-
C chitecture of the Cathedral from the Forbes street
light—well, narrowly escaped injury when a milk bottle,
dropped from approximately the tenth story of the build-
-ing, crashed on the tile ﬂooring in the center of the
group.

Marble paneling and large mirrors in men’s washrooms
In the Cathedral were reported broken by students pull-
ing on coat hooks.

Numberless electric light plugs and other small equip-
ment throughout the building have been stolen and in
many cases, torn from the walls.

These incidents and many others serve to indicate that
certain Pitt students have not the slightest conception
of common, ordinary courtesy or that they fail to appre-
ciate the value of University and public property.

In its present unﬁnished state the Cathedral might, in
some persons, not attract the respect that its ﬁnished
condition undoubtedly will. Bare walls, cement ﬂoors,
lead pipes showing on ceilings, although not artistic,
possess nothing that should incite students to destruc-
tive activities.

“A Subtle Emanation”
By Saul Weisberg

Editor's Note:—The opinions expressed in this col-
umn are the personal views of the writer and are
not to be taken to be in conformance with the edi-
torial policy of the Pitt News.

INCE PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT ASSUMED office al-
most nine months ago, there has been a tremendous
amount of publicity, criticism, and approval given his
concrete acts and the various parts of his entire pro-
gram. The NRA, the AAA, the Public W'orks Adminis-
tration, and various other speciﬁc moves have all re--

ceived great acclaim and have occasionally met with‘
weighty objections. There have been, however, astonish-
ingly few attempts made to appraise the plan in its en-
tirety or the idea at the basis of it, and this last is some-

thing that vitally needs to be done, since President
Roosevelt has been the sponsor of an entire scheme for
reconstruction, not the creator of a few individual or-
ganizations.

The fundamental purpose of President Roosevelt's
large scheme is, I believe, for the United States to be-
come a self-sustaining economy, producing almost entire-
ly for the masses at home, and having as little as possi-
ble to do with other countries. This purpose is evi-
denced in the Agricultural Adjustment Administration,
the object of which is to cut down the extent of produc-f
tion of farm goods in this country until we have little
surplus to export to other nations. This purpose is also
evidenced in the high tariff rates which President Roose-
velt has at least tacitly approved, thus preventing either
imports to or exports from this country. Then the NRA
is basically an attempt to restrict production of indus-
trial concerns with an effort to raise the purchasing
power of industrial workers so that they, with the farm-
ers, may be able to absorb industrial and agricultural
output.‘ Finally, the utterances of Professor Moley, the
President's chief adviser, and occasionally the speeches
of President Roosevelt himselflend strength to this in-
terpretation of the Presidents, aims.

UCH A SELF-SUSTAINING ECONOMY, however, is

in its conception essentially an impossibility. It re-
veals a clear realization of the condition which has made
a ﬂourishing capitalism in the United States impossible,
but, at the sam.e time, rests its hopes for success in an
attempt to solve an irreconcilable element of the present
system. That is, President Roosevelt has recognized
that the constriction of the world market since the
World War has made it impossible for the United States
to export its surpluses to other countries. Therefore. we
are not going to depend for prosperity upon other coun-
tries. But he has not accomplished anything important
in the way of meeting the situation caused by ma1dis-
tribution of wealth in the United States.

For President Roosevelt’s self-sustaining economy is
capitalism with its inevitable inequality of income, re-
sultant from the practice of proﬁts. And proﬁts and in-
equality of income mean that the wealthy invest their
surplus income in capital goods. For the wealthy have
to do something with the excess of income which they
do not spend on consumption goods, and so they invest
it in capital goods, which produce raw materials. This

United States is to be prosperous, since this investment
is the main method by which proﬁts are made by the
wealthy. And the extent of proﬁts is the measure of
prosperity from the capitalistic point of view.
S A MATTER OF FACT, the only way we can get
permanently out of the depression is to furnish a
proﬁtable market for goods, so that investment may be
made. But our market in foreign countries is lost and
recognized as lost by President Roosevelt. But if we do
not depend upon foreign markets, then we must depend
upon the market at home. However, the market at home
must inevitably be unable to absorb the huge aggregate;
of goods produced by investment and reinvestment, since '
the inequality of income causes a lack of purchasing
power. Thus, we will always have as we have now a
large surplus of goods, with no place for it except the
Mississippi river. This permanent surplus of goods, of
course, causes permanent depression.

The above does not mean that I think that we can not
get out of the present slump. It is possible, I believe,
for a. stiff dose of inﬂation, properly administered, to
bring temporary prosperity. But it will be only tempor-
ary. After inflation will come depression again, perman-
ent and severe depression. And after some more years
of depression will come—well, you guess.

Photographic Exhibit Of New England

Houses Given By Fine Arts Department  

A photographic exhibit, arranged
professor of F‘ine
Arts, of seventeenth century houses

. in New England is now being held in

the library of the department of ﬁne
There are shown examples of
the main types of the early Rhode
Island and Massachusetts houses
which are similar in many respects
to English houses and cottages of
Elizabethan and Jacobean times. The
ﬁrst of these is a timber construction,
plain pitch roof, with a single end
chimney of stone. These were one
and one-half stories» high, one room
on the ground ﬂoor with a huge ﬁre
place extending almost. the width of
the short end, leaving room for a small
narrow stair. ‘Later they developed
into two and one-half story houses
with lean-tos. An example of this
type is the Eleazer Arnold House in
Providence, Rhode Island, built in
1687. The lean-to seen in this picture
has been added at a much later date.

Immediately below is a photograph
of the Peter Tufts House in Medford,
Massachusetts, built probably between
1677 and 1680, exemplifying a third
type of the seventeenth century house,
a stone construction having a, chimney
at each end.

Better known perhaps and one of
which a. reproduction of the hall
kitchen can be seen in the American
Vlfing at the Metropolitan Museum in
New York is the Parson Capen house
at Topsﬁeld, Massachusetts, at central
chimney timber construction without
additions,

In the well-known House of Seven
Gables in Salem, Mass, is a ﬁfth va-
riation of the central chimney house
in the extra gables and wings. The
oldest part was built in 1669 with the
exception of the lean-to which was
added more recently,

Also to be seen in the exhibition is
the “Old Ship” Meeting House, at
Hingham, Mass, 1680; and a print of
Harvard College built about 1740.
showing the second Harvard ‘Hall
built of timber in 1675, destroyed by
ﬁre in 1764; Old Stoughton Hall,
built 1699, demolished about 1765; and
Massachusetts Hall, built in 1720, The
exhibit will be open until the ﬁrst of
November.

ROTC :i.;;{.;;;.y
Meets At Dinner

Scabbard And Blade To Celebrate
Birth Of Theodore Roosevelt

 

Today has been designated as na-
tional Scabbard and Blade day by
the various companies and alumni
posts of the national society of Scab-
bard and Blade, to celebrate the an-
niversary of the birth of former Presi-
dent Theodore Roosevelt. The local
D company, seventh regiment, at the
University, is observing this event by
a dinner at the Ruskin apartments to-
night at 6:30 o’clock.

This afternoon Scabbard and Blade
will decorate the Tomb of the Un-
known Soldier at Arlington cemetery,
Washington, D, C., in memory of the
three thousand members of its organ-
ization who participated in the World
War.

The national society of Scabbard‘
a.nd Blade was founded nearly thirty
years ago at the University of ‘Wis-
consin by five cadet ofﬁcers, and last
year a memorial ﬂagpole was erected
at that institution in honor of the
founders. The organization has sev-
enty-eight chapters in forty-ﬁve states
and a total membership of approx-
imately 20,000.

The purpose of the society is to
defend American traditions and
ideals, to promote the interest of
ROTC training, to develop the essen-
tial qualities of good and efficient of-
ﬁcers and to spread intelligent in-
formation concerning the military re-
quirements of our country.

Leather And Bells 1

Spring is in the air, even if it doesn't seem so to one who is still ‘with-
out a topcoat and plenty cold. The prophet of good things to come is none
other than Joe Orsini, Pitt boxing coach, who breezed into town looking like
a fashion plate, and full of enthusiasm. It seems that a goodly number of
freshman boxing prospects have been uncovered, hence the glad tidings.

At the present time, Orsini is dividin his time between a store

in Ciairton and the coming amateur boxing tournament.

in addition

to this, he is doing some missionary boxing work amon the fresh.

Otherwise, his time is free.

In case anyone desires to either enroll

for the Pitt boxing team, or enter the coming tournament, he should

get in touch with Orsini at Trees gym.

Incidentally, Orsini has a. swell scheme to promote boxing at Pitt. The
plans include an interfraternity boxing tournament and a tournament for the
non-fraternity men. As yet, the plan has not been approved, but the Scout
can see no reason why it shouldn't go through.

Pep Rally

The recent pep rally for the beneﬁt of the gridders who meet Notre

Dame tomorrow was all right, as pep meetings go.

The crowd happened to

be in the right spirit, and even the Dental School received its accustomed

“boos" in good clean fun after the “chant.”

The meeting was carried out

without a hitch, and Judge Smith should be thanked for giving his valuable

time to attend the meeting.

Both teams in tomorrow’s game have lost all chance of attaining a

national title, and the affair tomorrow will be a sure-enough scrap, literally

Whoever wins that game will know that they really won

something besides plenty of bruises and cuts.

Predictions OF The Week!

What do I think? Now that you were mean enough to bring that

up, I may as well tell all.

No, I'd better not, the occult powers of

the Scout seem to have dimmed somewhat in the past few weeks.
But wait, pass up a prediction and give the printers a chance to

Before a gathering of ﬁfty men in

University fall track and ﬁeld games
received awards for their efforts as
track men,

W. Don Harrison, director of ath-

congratulating the winners a.nd urg-
ing them to follow up the beginning
they have made in the track and ﬁeld
sport. The medals were made up of
a gold bar, upon which was mounted
a miniature panther, attached to a
blue ribbon, supporting a rectangular
key bearing the University seal. Sil-
ver keys went to the ﬁrst-place win-
ners, bronze keys to those who ﬁn-
ished second and ribbons to third-

each key was the name of the event
and the place won.

the list and included in his remarks
congratulations and thanks to the

Forty-Five Men Take Part In
Training Under Direction
Of Dr. H. C. Carlson

 

 

Get Drill ln Fundamentals

The stadium basketball pavilion
has been the scene of some very un-
usual activity this past week. Forty-
ﬁve novice basketball players are
whooping it up every afternoon from
3:30 in the second annual men’s bask-
etball tourney, under the direction of
Dr. H, C. Carlson, head basketball
coach of the University.

While a good percentage of the boys
are members of the freshman class,
there is still a fair sprinkling of up-
per-classmen among those who cavort
over the hardwood ﬂoor. The play-
ers are wearing uniforms of every de-
Soriptioll. and it really doesn’t seem
to be making a Whole lot of diﬁer-
ence.

During the first two days of the
tournament, the novices were divided
up into teams and played a series of
games of “twenty-one" and several
variations of passing contests, This
practice gave the basketeers plenty of
opportunity to shoot baskets and han-
dle the ball. The next day, drilling
in the fundamentals was installed
with sgme rather surprising results.

Not a few of the freshmen taking
part have been pretty fair basketball
players in their respective high
schools, but when Dr. Carlson got to
putting these fellows through their
paces in the fundamentals, there were
some very sorry displays of pivoting
and cutting and the other niceties of
the cage game. Thus, the boys who
were mere beginners at the game
weren’t out of place in the funda-
mental drills.

The general system of the game as
played by the Pitt freshman team
was then introduced to the novices.
Outside triangles and inside trian-
gles had the lads guessing for awhile,

but they gradually became accus-

decided, however, that he had better
not attempt the “diagonal triangle"
plan. “But,” says the doctor, “they’re
getting some good lessons in peri-
pheral vision, and you know what that
means.”
