asks for

increase

in state
funding

Mary Mallampalli
Staﬁ Writer

Pitt has asked the state legisla-
ture for an 11.3 percent increase
in funding next year, though the
requested increase would not
keep students’ tuitions ﬂat.

Pitt officials‘ said that they
are unsure whether or not the
University will actually receive
the increase that they requested
in September. As a state—related

. university, Pitt submits a fund-

ing request each year to the state
and until last year, state dollars
made up about 10 percent of
Pitt’s budget.

If the state approves the re-
quested increase in money, Pitt

_ spokesman John Fedele said

that the University will limit the
2012-2013 tuition increase to
four percent. Pitt officials made
similar statements about tuition
last year when they submitted
their requests, before receiving a
22 percent state funding cut and
increasing tuition by 8.5 percent
for in—state students.

' Paul Supowitz, Pitt’s vice
chancellor for governmental re-
lations, said that the University
should receive an answer from
the Commonwealth by late May
or early June.

Student ,
alumnus  

settle  

G-20 suit

Tegan I-Iianlon
Assistant News Editor

The city of Pittsburgh settled a
G—2o lawsuit with a Pitt student
and Pitt alumnus on Monday for
$60,000.

U.S. Army 2nd Lt. Ryan Kings-
ton and Pitt junior Nathan Po-
loni sued the city in November
2010. The lawsuit said that they
were subject to “de facto marshal
law” and that their constitution-
al rights were suspended when
police arrested them on Sept.
24, 2009, outside of Litchfield
Towers.

The city and Timothy P.
O’Brien, the men’s attorney,
settled the lawsuit out of court.

City Solicitor Daniel Regan
said that the city’s insurance
carrier will pay for the settle-
ment. He said that the city is
self—insured but obtained ad-
ditional insurance for the 2009
summit.

- “We believe - that was the
most prudent decision to settle
the claims for $60,000,” Regan
said, adding that the plaintiffs
and their council will decide how
todistribute the money.

Regan said that they do not ,
typically discuss settlement ne-
gotiations but he did not believe
that O’Brien asked for specific
damages.

O’Brien could not be reached
for immediate comment.

Pitt unsure if state

will increase funding

in troubled economy

Funding 4 1

appropriations for Pitt and the
other three state—related univer-
sities is decided in a separate bill
from the main state budget. The
bill must be approved by both
state legislatures and then signed
by the governor.

“There’s really no way to pre-
dict what the economic climate
will become next May orjune
when it’s time to pass the state
budget,” Supowitz said. “Because
of that, we really make the re-
quest based upon what the Uni-
versity’s basic needs are, so that’s
how it’s formulated, and in that
regard, it is certainly realistic
with regard to the University’s
needs.”

In 2010, Pitt asked for a five
percent increase in funding but
received a 22 percent cut in-
stead. Because of the cuts, the
University received $136 million
in funding, down from $184 mil-
lion in 2010 that included almost
$20 million in temporary federal
stimulus funds.

The state appropriation went
through a number of dramatic

I changes over the summer, be-

ginning with Gov. Tom Corbett’s
proposal to cut 52 percent of
Pitt’s funding. This figure was

'then negotiated down to 22 per-

cent and signed the day before
the constitutionally mandated
deadline.

Pitt will also restore all fund-
ing to the programs affected by
the 50 percent decrease in state
funding from the Department of
Welfare this year, including the
Academic Medical Center, Pitt’s
School of Medicine, the den-
tal clinic, the Center for Public
Health Practice and Western Psy-
chiatric Institute and Clinic.

Fedele said that Pitt requested
the increase in funding in an ef-
fort to restore last year’s cut to
Pitt’s state appropriation. When
requesting the increase in fund-
ing, Pitt officials took into ac-
count the four percent overall
reduction in the Commonwealth’s
budget last year as well as an ad-
justment for inflation.

“We recognize that the Com-
monwealth faced a daunting
shortfall for fiscal year 2012,”
Fedele said in an email. “But Pitt
was asked to shoulder more than
our fair share of the burden re-
quired for the Commonwealth
to meet its budget, and meeting
this appropriation request will
address that inequality.” I

Pitt’s students may be getting

I down, but, according to a national

survey, so is their sexual health.

Trojan Brand Condoms ranked
the University 27th out of 140
colleges in their Trojan Sexual
Health Report Card rankings,
down from its spot at 21 last year.
The report ranks colleges based
on their available sexual health
resources.

Columbia University snagged

the No. 1 spot for the second‘

year in a row. Rutgers and West
Virginia both fared better than
Pitt, while Penn State came in at
36. The colleges evaluated are

drawn from conferences within »

the Bowl Championship series
and beyond. '

Last year, Pitt received the title
of “Most Improved Player” in the
rankings because of its 54—spot
jump from 75th to 21st place.

Sperling BestPlaces, an inde-
pendent research firm, conduct-
ed the Trojan—sponsored report,

. now in its sixth year.

Bert Sperling, who runs the
Portland-based survey compa-
ny, said that the rankings raise

awareness of sexual health issues

while celebrating colleges that
get sexual health information out
to students.

“At the end of the day, it’s what
is effective for the students. We
try to put ourselves in the posi-
tion of the students,” Sperling
said, referring to the process the
company uses to determine the
availability of information.

Sperling said that to conduct
the report, his company reaches
out ‘to health centers about the
sexual health services and re-
sources they have available to
students, and each school an-
swers a two—page questionnaire
covering the 13 areas. . _

These areas include things like

Pitt’s sexual health  
services ranked 27th

student opinion on the health
center, the hours of operation,
sexual health awareness_pro-
grams and sexual assault pro-
grams, contraceptive availability,
condom availability, HIV and'STI
testing and website usability.

Marian Vanek, the director of
Pitt’s Student Health Services,
said in an email that Pitt offers a
variety of comprehensive and ac-
cessible sexual health program-
ming, all of which is free.

The Office of Health Educa- I

tion and Promotion runs Pitt’s
sexual health services. It provides

.on-site and off—site programs on

birth control, condom use, ab-
stinence and STD information
and testing throughoutthe year,
Vanek said.

“Our goal is to provide stu-
dents with services and resources
to make informed decisions re-
garding their sexual health,” she
said in an email. .

Pitt also offers HIV testing,
which Vanek said has increased
by 96 percent since last year.

The. University also provides
the Gardasil vaccine for free. The

‘vaccine, which usually costs $140

per dose, protects against HPV,
an STD that Vanek said causes 70

.percent of cervical cancers and

90 percent of genital warts.

Sperling said that a team of
ﬁve recent college graduates also
evaluate each school’s website
to see how useful it is, because,
that is the first place students
will look for information.

“We believe that students
these days more than ever get
their information from the In-
ternet,” he said.

‘ Sperling said he believes that
these rankings, which are getting
more competitive each year, re-
ally have an impact on colleges
across the nation. Students can
see how their school compares to
othercolleges to make sure they

--are3“getting the resources they

need_;_and deserve.” I

Board amends , overturns Allocations recommendation

Michael Ringling
Staﬁ" Writer

Members of the National Society of Black
Engineers, who attended to show support for
an allocations request in jeopardy, made up
about half of the audience at Tuesday night’s

T Student Government Board meeting.

The student group’s representatives at-
tended the meeting at Nordy’s Place to protest
the Allocations Comrnittee’s initial recommen-

‘ dation to deny the group’s $3,580 allocations

request in ﬁill. The money would pay for nine
members to attend the NSBE Fall Regional
Conference in Baltimore.

Allocations chair Michael Bane said that

I the Committee initially denied the request

because the event focused on personal devel-
opment. The Committee did not believe that
students would bring relevant information

. back to campus.

Junior Piaget Francois, president of the
NSBE, said that the regional conference would
allow their group’s senators to vote on na-
tional issues pertaining to the society, provide
training for the group’s top ﬁve members and
meet with other chapters of the‘ national or-
ganization to discuss ideas for improving the
student group.

Board member Matthew Riehle said that

. the Board should fund the attendance of

four members, in line with the Allocations
Manual. ' 1
Riehle said that he thought there was mis
communication between the NSBE and SGB
about the content of the event.
“I think it is something you should be fund-
ed for,” he said. “There is a lot of good in it.”
Board member John Hasley motioned to

extend the discussion time by two minutes _

before Riehle proposed the amendment to the

request. The amended motion passed unani— .

mously. The group was approved $1,563.57 for
four members to attend but denied $2,016.43
for the other ﬁve in the initial request.

“Of course we wanted more money,”
Francois said. “I think the new conclusion
was fair.”

The Elections Committee announced that
SGB candidates can begin publicly campaign-

ing this Friday for the Nov. 17 election.

On the November ballot, students will

endum that could affect next year’s elec-
tion. If passed, students will vote for eight
board members in the 2012 election.
Allocations:

Pitt Men’s Volleyball Club requested $800
to cover referee fees for more than 20 games.
The board approved the request in ﬁill.

Pitt’s Men’s‘ Volleyball Club requested
$456.45. The Allocations Committee approved
the request in ﬁill.

Allocations Committee approved Panther

Allocations Committee approved Inter-
national Socialist Organization’s request for
$220.

Panther Paintball Club’s requests for
$1,900 and $889.24 were postponed because
the amount requested for a national competi-
tion was different from last year’s request for
the same competition. The Committee and the
club team were still sorting out the request.

Panther Paintball Club requested $900 for
tournament fees. The Board approved $450 to
cover the A team’s entry fee but denied $450
for the B team’s entry fee.

Panther Paintball Club requested $4,500
for the paint necessary to compete in three
tournaments. The board approved $2,250 for
the A team but denied $2,250 for the B team in
accordance with the Allocations Committee’s
recommendation.

Panther Paintball Club requested $5,100

to cover ﬁeld rental fees for six practices and

individual fees. The board approved $4,500
for the rental fees but denied $600 for the
individual fees.

We need federal
student loans 5

Ron Paul is dominating some
headlines this week.

The Republican presidential
contender said Sunday on “Meet
the Press” that, if elected, he’d
eventually like to phase out fed-
eral student loans, which have
helped put students $1 trillion
in debt amidst a struggling job
market and economy.

National headlines have been
fear-mongering at best, like Po-
litico’s “Ron Paul: End U.S. Stu-
dent Loans.” We realize slashing
student loans isn’t part of Paul’s
campaign, but the thought of no
federal college loans both in-
trigues and scares us.

The idea is that tuition rates
are so high because schools re-
alize that students will borrow
in order to attend. Thus, if the
government no longer lends, uni-
versities’ student supply would
drop drastically and they would
be forced to lower tuition to main-
tain their bottom lines.

It sounds like a great idea in
theory, but there are several ways
it wouldgo wrong. i

According to The Wall Street
Journal, the average student loan
debt among 2011 graduates was
about $23,000. That’s an average
out of every student, including
those who don’t take out loans
as well as those who are, say,
$100,000 in debt. But with a
number that high, it’s clear that
college students rely on borrow-
ing in order to get their degrees.

Without federal student loans,
the neediest people would strug-
gle the most. The Department
of Education states that federal
student loans have both lower
interest rates and more ﬂexible
payment options than loans from
banks or private lenders.

Paul also dreams of a world
where students can pay as they go.‘
He worked through college back
in the day, so the idea is that --
when the economy turns around
—- students would be able to pay
for college through hard work at

part—time jobs. The problem with
that? It’s a whole different ball
game for students today, as op-
posed to the ’50s and ’_60s.

Earlier this month, Pitt ap-
proved $152 million in construc-
tion and renovation. According
to The Pitt Chronicle, about $9
million will go to renovation
projects for the Chevron Science
Center, including a molecular
characterization facility and X-
raydiffraction equipment. While
the construction’s funding doesn’t
come from students, the point
remains the same. Technology
has exponentially grown over the
past 50 years, and it’s important
to remember that these advance-
ments cost money.

That’s the academic environ-
ment that surrounds us; It’s all
about having the best facilities,
sports teams and even the best
students. And being the best
means charging students a for-
tune so schools can spend a for-
tune.

That point segues into the am-
bivalence of a draconian policy
like this. No one can say for sure
whether universities would cut
their tuitions or not if Paul gets
his way. ‘

There are several reasons for
ballooning tuition in- addition
to the one that Paul focused on.
According to Consumer Affairs,
reduced support from state gov-
ernments, the high cost of being
an elite school and competition
between schools all contribute

. _to steady tuition inﬂation. Those

reasons need to be accounted for
in order to provide a convincing
argument that tuition rates will
drop.

Cutting supposedly superﬂu-
ous spending -is like a game of
Jenga. The infrastructure of our
economy can stay together with
a few holes in it, but if we pull the
wrong pieces, it’ll all fall apart.

We don’t think federal stu-
dent loans are the right pieces
to pull". I

It’s 9 p.m. on a gloomy weeknight

noxious pile of dirty laundry
you’ve been neglecting all semes-
ter. Sure, you could give the pile a
few spritzes of Febreze, but that
marvelous elixir doesn’t grow on
trees, and you’re not sitting on

The untimely delay of the NBA season isn’t the end of

them outof their podunk towns.
Sandwiched between the nigh-
interminable TV time outs --
during which you’re bombarded
with ﬂashy advertisements for
hot “kicks” like the latest Air]or-
dans and sweet, citrusy drinks
like Sprite — are a handful of
ungainly free throws, pointless
personal fouls and “bricked”
3-pointers. For long stretches of
time, both teams appear to be
fielding line—ups that consist of
no fewer than four small forwardl
shooting guard “tweeners” who
were originally lottery picks, but
have since ﬂopped because of an

. inability to lead their teams in

any statistical category except
field goal attempts.

After 10 minutes of this te-
dious spectacle, your $5 pizza
pies arrive and you switch on
ESPN SportsCenter to watch all
of the gravity-defying slams,
jams and 360-degree no—look
dunks that look so fantastic out
of context. In one such high-
light, Los Angeles Lakers power
forward Blake Griffin drives the
ball through the hoop, breaking
the backboard in the process.

Memphis Grizzlies power for-.

Or maybe it is.

ward Zach Randolph and Port-
land Trailblazers power forward
LaMarcus Aldridge do likewise.
Man, you‘ ask yourself, how can
this league afford so many back-
boards? Finally, Minnesota Tim-
berwolves power forward Kevin
Love is shown jumping roughly
one half-inch off the ground as
he launches a “trey,” much to
the delight of the 2,000 or so
fans in attendance who can’t get-

‘enough of his “work ethic” and V

attention to the “fundamentals.”
You greedily stuff your face with

pizza, accelerating your progress T

toward the _“ripped” 22o—pound
physique you’ll need for spring
break 2013, and contemplate
how this probably wasn’t the
least boring way you could have
spent your evening. to
Now consider the horrifying
alternative: It’s 9 p.m. on a gloomy
weeknight in late December. The
pile of laundry is still on the ﬂoor,
the $5 pizza pies are still on their
way — only the NBA season has
been canceled! Yep, you, read that
right: No slams, no jams, not even
one single, 36,0.-degree no—look

FOOTBALL '

P Pitt gears up for Huskies

I

Dustin Gabler
Stajfwriter

The Pitt football team will look to
right the ship in tonight’s Big East
match-up with defending confer-
ence champion Connecticut after
dropping the past two games.

The Huskies‘ are not the same
team that defeated the Panthers 30-
28 in Connecticut last season: The
team is now led by former Syracuse
head coach Paul Pasqualoni. Despite
losing Randy Edsall to Maryland,
UConn has maintained its traditional

-A ‘and ﬁindamental brand of football.

“They are very similar to last
year in the overall makeup of their
team, and very disciplined,” Pitt head
coach Todd Graham said. “They are
defense-oriented and a ﬁeld posi-
tion type team. There are some dif-
ferences this year in the schematics
of things with how they line up and
their pressures.” ’

Both teams currently sit at 3-4
and are 1-1 in Big East conference
play. With only Cincinnati remain-
ing undefeated in conference play,
the Big East Championship is still
up for grabs. The midweek meeting
between the Huskies and the Pan-
thers could be the turning point for
one squad. ‘

The Panthers -— despite play-
ing their two worst games in the
past two weeks —— have kept their
eyes on what they have left on the
schedule.

On defense, Pitt will have to keep
an eye on freshman running back

' ’ Lyle McCombs, who is averaging 4

yards a carry and has found the end
zone four times this season. Mc-
Combs will be working out of a pro-
style type backﬁeld, where UConn
will have a lead fullback and at least

 ﬁve down linemen.

“Even though it’s a pro—stylelof-
fense, we can still run our diffefent
packages against them,” Pitt defen-
sive backjarred Holley said.‘  

UConn is also led by junior quar-
terback Johnny McEntee. Despite
having an inconsistent year, McEn-
tee has thrown for over 1,200 yards
and six touchdowns. 1

“We have to bounce back,” junior
safety Andrew Taglianetti said. ?‘We
have ﬁve conference games left; and
those are the big ones. We need to
focus up and come back and ﬁnish
strong.” 

Bouncing back will require a

more consistent offense. The Pan-
thers have averaged only 12 points in
their past two contests. Along with a
game of quarterback musical chairs,
the Panthers have had to deal with
injuries up front that have created an
up -and-down running attack. While
the new system has been in place for
some time now, the Panthers offense
still seems to be growing as a unit.

“Every day we practice this sys-
tem, we get more comfortable with it.
The number one thing isto be disci-
plined,” Graham said. “We probably
tried to do too much inthe beginning
and we have had some challenges
along the way. At this point, we have
been inconsistent, and we have to
become consistent. In order to do
that, you have to be ﬁmdamentally
sound and be disciplined.”

After inconsistent performances
in the past two games and numerous
questions put to Graham, it appears
that junior Tino Sunseri will remain
in the game, barring an injury.

Pitt’s head coach still ﬁrmly be-
lieves that Sunseri is his best option
at quarterback, and he will look to get
the team back on course tonight.

“[Sunseri] has had ,a great 10
days,” Graham said. “We have
worked hard with-him to make sure
he understands what we’re trying
to accomplish and to adapt some
things to help him execute what
we’re doing. He continues to have a
great attitude, he works hard and I
have a lot of conﬁdence that he will
play well.”

Freshman backup quarterback
Trey Anderson got some playing
time in the loss to Utah, but suffered
a wrist injury. Sophomore Mark My-
ers has stepped in for him.

“Mark Myers had a great week

of practice,” Graham said. “If some-' .

thing happened, then he would be
the next guy off the bench. I am really

proud of Mark and how he has re- »

sponded this week, so hewill remain
our backup quarterback.’_’ . 4
Graham has-p’réviously'altemated
snaps between Sunseri and Ander-
son, but after a poorperformanceby
both players in the loss to Utah that
Graham blamed on those switches,
such swaps seemlless likely.
Sunseri will need to have a good
performance, because the Huskies

. willbefocused on starjunior running

back Ray Graham.

“The ﬁrst  is tonput them‘

in situations where [Pittsburgh]
has to throw_ the ball,” Pasqualoni

said. “With their tailback Ray Gra-
ham, that is going to be quite a chal-
lenge. We’ll have a chance to rush the
passer and disrupt the offense, but
we’ve got to get them in those kinds
of situations.”

Pasqualoni spoke highly of Gra-
ham’s explosiveness and the threat
that he poses catchingthe ball out of
the backﬁeld.

“I think what he does well, be- *

sides the speed, is his explosiveness,”
Pasqualoni said. “He has the abil-
ity to put the ball in the end zone

from -70 yards away. The other thing .
that I admire about the guy ‘is.~that °

he can make multiple people miss

. on one play. He’s got 30 catches for
over200 yards, so he’s not only their _

most productive back, but he’s also
the second leading receiver on the
team.” _ l . .
Coach Graham knows that his
season will be judged on how his
Panthers do during this stretch. In
a still~winnable conference, tonight’s

game would go a long way to  the/. :

tone in his inaugural season. _ }- , :;
“It is similar tolast year"
was sitting at 4-3 and then wonthe
last six games straight. It’s really not
about how you start but it’s how you
ﬁnish,” Graham said. “We are not far
off, and we believe this is the time to
do it. College football is all about put-
ting yourself in the position to win
a championship in November and
that’s what we’re trying to do.”

On the injury front, senior offen- ,
‘ sive lineman Lucas Nix’s return will

be a game-time decision. Starring
freshman linebacker Todd Thomas
will be makinga return after missing
two weeks.

Taglianetti  be replacing de-,

fensive back Jason Hendricks, who

is out for the year with a _shgulde,_r
injury. ’ ' 

When it comes to losing‘fHen- '
dricks, fellow defensive backjarred 9
«Holley isn’t worried. ‘

“Tags is more than capable of '
doing the job and we’re more than
happy to have him back there,” Hol-" .

ley said. .

Holley, who will be playing de-
fensive back alongside Taglianetti,
is just excited to see a new team on
the field. _ '

there again andgfagg an opponent

GREGORIAN RANTS

MLB needs

Greg Trietley
Senior Staff Writer

So how about that World Series?

For another year in a row, Ameri-
cans have turned away from’ base-
ball’s postseason in favor of football
—— both professional and college —
and even hockey.

Game 1 between the St. Louis
Cardinals and Texas Rangers drew
an 8.'7§Nielsen television audience
ramiglast Wednesday. Compare that
to the 13995 World Series between the
Atlanta Braves and Cleveland Indians,

_ which received a 16.4 rating, and the

1984 World Series between the De-
troit Tigers and the San Diego Padres,
which received a 27.7.

Basebaﬂ is trending downward,

‘but it can be saved.

, The National Hockey League saw
its popularity bottom out during the
2004-05 lockout, but it came back
with a salary cap, a shoot-out and
a new philosophy —- andvnow it’s
thriving.

While Major League Baseball
doesn’tyet have the impetus to make
the drastic alterations that the NHL
made, it would be wise to plan now for
changes that absolutely must happen
down the road. A

Change #1: Yes, the league
needs a salary cap, but it also needs
a cap floor. A . .

. Baseball needs a salary cap,
and people have clamored for one
for years now. just as importantly,
though, -it needs ‘a cap ﬂoor.

‘ The" Florida Marlins turn a
healthy proﬁt by spending next to

no money on players, having next A

to no one show up to games and col-

lecting money because of revenue '

 NHL’s salary-capped world,

.---r

.  teams lock up young stars
'2 .-ea._tfly,'l’ and the difference between Cup

contention and missing the playoffs is
one good or bad oﬁseason. Baseball
should emulate that formula.
‘ Change #2: Push the fences

The home run grew tiresome by

‘ 2oc;g2. An emphasis on the long ball

even?%the pitcherfellasleep. Players _

didn’t need speed to be great.

Every time 5—foot-10, 195-pound
second baseman Skip Schumaker
steps to the plate for St. Louis, he
stands out because he looks like an
actual person — not some bloated

monster that requires a custom hat ’

SIZE

chises push back theinstadiums’ out-
ﬁeld walls, complete players would
reign once more. Outﬁelders with
range would have more value than
the chubby power hitter batting .240.
Franchiseswillbemoan the potential
loss of some bleacher seats, but on
most nights those are empty any-

For stadiums,‘ that can’t reconﬁg-
ure to new dimensions, highwalls like

_ Fenway Park’s work, too. Make the

home run a true feat again. Fans don’t
ask each other, “Has anybody ever hit
it over the short porch in right?” V

Change #3: Enforce Rule 8.04. --

Rule.8.04 states, “When the bases
are unoccupied,the pitcherr,"slha,ll de-
liver the ball to the  :12
secondsafterhe receives the ball.
Each time the pitcher delays the game
by violatingthis rule, the umpire shall
call Ball.” ' 1 _

" Stadiums shouldn’t have to. play
musical interludes between pitches.

Rule 8.04 speeds the game up. En— -

force ‘it, and add additional time lim-

its that encompass all pitches — not .

just ones with the bases empty. Intro-
duce _rules that prevent hitters from
tediously stepping out of the batter’s

- box between every delivery, too.

Change #4: Design a shorter,
player-friendly schedule.

Fewer regular-season games en-
courage a smaller, four-man pitch-
ing rotation that concentrates talent.

Will anyone mind if Ross Ohlendorf -

doesn’t have to make a spot start next
season?  ' V

Owners will lament the _l_oss of
revenue, but consider it a trade-off

to the salary cap and de-emphasis .

of the home run already forced on
the players in this column. Players
stay healthier »— no more dog days
of summer — and the quality of each
game improves. . .
Currently, the 162-game schedul

wears on both the players and the
fans. Bythe timethe postseason rolls
around, everybody is ready to move
on to football. With a redesigned

_ schedule and a reinvigorated sport,

maybe someone-will pay attention.»

Another former Panther in his rookie season

Sta ff Wri ter 4 who made an impact Sunday wasjabaal Sheard

They spent their collegiate careers playing
football on Saturdays at the home of the Pitts-
burgh Steelers. This past Sunday, however, two
former Panthers and currentArizona Cardinals

' .— Larry Fitzgerald (Pitt wide receiver; 2002-

2003) and LaRod Stephens-Howling (Pitt run-

ning back, 2005-2008) —— did their best to help '

their team in a game against the Steelers.

Fitzgerald led Arizona receivers with 78
receiving yards on four catches, but Stephens-
Howling, whom Cardinals fans have nicknamed
“The Hyphen,” made Arizona’s biggest play of
the game. -

Early in the second half, Stephens-Howling
caught a short pass and was able to run the ball
upﬁeld fora73-yard touchdown, showing offhis
speed and big-play ability.

“I felt like I had to take it to the house,” Ste-
phens-Howling said in apostgame press confer-
ence. “I’m thankful for those receivers blocking
downﬁeld.” .

Stephens-_Howling’s touchdowncutthe Pitts-
burgh lead to three in the third quarter but both
Fitzgerald’s and Stephens-Howling’s contribu-
tions weren’t enough,‘ as the Steelers defeated
the Cardinals 32-20.

Anotherfonner Pantherwho made abig play
on Sunday is New Yorkjet Darrelle Revis (Pitt
cornerback, 2004-2006). With the Jets down
four and the San Diego Chargers driving, Revis
recorded a crucial interception ﬁ'om Chargers
quarterback Philip Rivers and returned it 64
yards to set up the Jets’ go—ahead touchdown
moments later.

“Sometimes you go out there and the ball

A bounces yourway,” Revis said after the game. “It

was a great play on eve’rybody’s part.”

The interception was Revis’ fourth of the
season and 18th of his career.

Jonathan Baldwin (Pitt wide receiver, 2008-
2010) ﬁnally recovered from a thumb injury in

the Oakland Raiders.

Sheard was a part of the Cleveland Browns
defense that held the Seattle Seahawks to three
points in the Browns’ ugly 6-3 win. He recorded
three tackles and took his season sack total to
two and a half with a halfsack.

Hisformer Pitt and current Browns teammate

Jason Pinkston (Pitt offensive line, 2007-2010)
started at left guard and helped Cleveland rushers
record 141 yards in the game.
