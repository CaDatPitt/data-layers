Preliminary hearing
held in Travelers raid

By Christine Biancheria
Contributing Editor

Five men pleaded no contest to
reduced charges of disorderly
conduct and were each fined
$100 Wednesday morning at a
preliminary hearing held before
a city magistrate in the downtown
Public Safety Building.

The defendants were originally
accused of simple assault, resist-
ing arrest, disorderly conduct and
obstructing justice during a raid
on Travelers Social Club, an after-
hours club catering to pre-

rights. The police were also ac-
cused of using profanity and anti-
gay slurs.

Witnesses said several cus-
tomers were forced to remain
standing outside the club in
l0-degree weather for over two
hours while awaiting police per-
mission to get their coats.

Representatives from Cry Out!,
a lesbian and gay action group,
released statements from eyewit-
nesses. According to Cry Outl,
one eyewitness said the police
were "knocking people down the
steps, and one customer, his leg

‘ 

There were no illegal enforcement procedures
or police brutality. The people pleaded guilty to

the charges.

dominantly homosexual cli-
entele.

The raid, led by Fire Chief
Kevin Mellot, was conducted by
17 Liquor Board agents and
Pennsylvania State Police at 4:30
am. on Feb. 14.

Police said they raided the club
in response to complaints of un-
derage drinking and drug use as
well as after-hours sales to non-
members.

Prior to the hearing, more than
100 protestors demonstrated in
front of the City-County Building,
voicing anger at the conduct of
the Liquor Board agents and the
State Police during the raid. Pro-
testors chanted, ”Kevin Mellot,
state police, shame on you!”

Police Chief Ralph Pampena
called the complaints of alleged
police brutality during the raid
”ridiculous.” Many of the 120
witnesses who were present
claimed the police beat cus-
tomers over the head with night
sticks and told them they had no

was caught in the steps and, be-
cause he couldn't move, they
said he was resisting arrest and
started beating him and threw
him over the railing to the floor
below, about 10 feet.

"They rushed down, and beat
him more and put cuffs on him
and kept beating him all the way
out the door," the witness said.

Another customer whose state-
ment was released by Cry Out!
said one man was ”thrown
through steel doors, covered in
blood. He fell and was half
dragged into the van, where he
sat bleeding for at least an hour
and a half before the van was
moved for medical attention.”

According to the Basic Nation-
al Fire Prevention Code, which
stipulates the requirements for
such an inspection, raiders must
present credentials to the club
owner and request permission to
investigate. If the owner denies
them access, they must produce
a search warrant.

VOLUME EIGHTY-TWO, ISSUE EIGHTY-FIVE

By Julie Shepard

Assistant News Editor

At the ”Meet the Candi-
dates” assembly last night in
the William Pitt Union Ball-
room, approximately 30 mem-
bers of the Black Action
Society nominated Rodney
Howerton and Maria Kersey to
run for chairperson and
deputy chairperson respective-

ly for the upcoming year.

The BAS found that an as-
sembly was necessary, as the
eligibility of both candidates
was questioned according to
the rules of the BAS election
committee.

The voting was open to the

Those present said the officers
at the raid would not give their
names or badge numbers when
requested to do so. Witnesses
also said that no one arrested was
informed of his rights; however,
the five defendants were unwill-
ing to testify under advice from
their attorney.

entire Pitt community be-
cause, as Monique Simms,
present chairperson of the
BAS, said, ’’I would rather
bring in students to help make
this decision instead of sitting
in an office and making it for
them.”

Simms, after opening the
meeting, turned the program
over to Sandra Sanders, elec-
tion chairperson, who ex-

plained the problem at hand,
the requirements for candi-
dates and the procedure that
would be followed to correct
the problem.

Mark Collins, political ac-
tion chairperson, controlled

Club owner Robert ”Lucky”
Johns; when questioned on the
procedures of the raid, said the
police did not show him a search
warrant or any identifying docu-
ments. He said, ”l tried to identi-
fy myself as the club owner and
was told to shut up. I again ap-
proached an officer and was told,

BAS elections will go as scheduled

he opened the floor for com-
ments and motions from the
audience for a remedy.

After approximately half an
hour of discussion, the majori-
ty decided to hold the elec-
tions as planned on March 1
with the candidates at hand.
With this decision, the factors
that determined them ineligi-
ble will be excused.

Rodney Howerton and Maria Kersey at the BAS's ”Meet the Candidates," which was
last night in the William Pitt Union.

Howerton said that he had
”mixed emotions” about the
decision. ”BAS was put in a
decision where they had to
choose [what to do]. This
won't haunt me, but I hope it
doesn't come back on this
BAS administration."

‘You can shut the fuck up.’ ”

Johns said the club intends to
file charges against the police for
their conduct and that the club is
already awaiting a hearing on a
two-year-old suit also concerning
harassment.

ONCUE, or the Organiza-
tion for Nearby Cultural Enjoy-
ment, was created this past fall
as a means to further expose
students to cultural activities in
the Pittsburgh area.

According to Dan Briller,
the group's founder, ONCU E's
main purpose is ”Getting peo-
ple together who are interest-
ed in the arts. This seems to
always be a problem, especial-
ly among the younger age

groups."

”Dan came to me asking for
ideas about what would be in-
teresting and exciting for the
students to do. I was glad to
help because I can make con-
nections in the city art com-
munity,” said Professor
Linduff, ONCUE’s faculty ad-
visor as well as chairperson of
the art department at Pitt.

Membership in ONCUE en-
titles you to attend group-
sponsored visits to local cultur-
al events. lncluded on the
agenda for upcoming weeks

are viewing of the Pittsburgh
Archeological Exhibit at the
Carnegie Museum of Natural
History and a trip to the Bene-
dum Center downtown for
Shakespeare's Macbeth.

Michelle McElgin, a phar-
macy major, said, ”My interest
in the arts goes as far as spec-
rating. I am not a participant."

”l've been in the theater for
most of my life performing in
dinner theaters, high school
productions and the like,” said
freshman member Alisa
Schulman.

JERUSALEM —- The Bechtel
Group Inc. offered in 1985 to sell
Israel oil at reduced rates for 10
years in return for a pledge not to
attack a proposed Iraqi pipeline,
a senior Foreign Ministry official
said Wednesday.

The offer by the San Francisco-
based construction and engineer--
ing company was relayed to then-
Prime Minister Shimon Peres by
Bruce Rappaport, a partner with
Bechtel in the project, the official
said. Reduced rates would have
resulted in an annual savings to
Israel of $65 million to $70
million.

In San Francisco, Tom Flynn,
vice president for public relations
for the Bechtel Group, said the
company did not make any offer
to Peres but that it was made by
Rappaport, a Swiss financier
working with Bechtel on the
project.

Flynn said the offer by Rap
paport was made without the
knowledge or the consent of
Bechtel.

Another Bechtel spokesman, Al
Donner, said Bechtel ”at no

point” in development of the
pipeline project had anything to
do with the handling of the oil.
He said proposals submitted by
the company ”did not include
any specific arrangements for the
handling of the oil or for the dis-
posal of the oil once it reached
the terminal.”

Asked about Bechtel’s dis-
claimers after they were made in
San Francisco, the Israeli Foreign
Ministry official said it was Peres’
understanding that Rappaport
made the offer for the company.

Pitt to study polio
recurrances in area

PITTSBURGH — University of
Pittsburgh researchers will study
why some people who had polio
may years later experience a
recurrance of symptoms, includ-
ing pain or weakness, the school
said.

The researchers are searching
for some of the 828 Allegheny
County residents who were treat-

ed at the now-closed Municipal
Hospital of Pittsburgh between
1950 and 1955. Information
gathered from those people will
be studied, the school said.
Researchers want to learn why

an estimated 25 to 30 percent of
former Polio patients suffer some
recurring symptoms, while others
do not, the school said in a writ-
ten release.

The search is part of a project
funded by a $50,000 grant from
the National March of Dimes.

’Drink tank’ getting

device will prove the solution to
cold coffee and flat beer.

”Right now there is no way to
get a hot beverage to somebody
in a football stadium,” said Bob
Billet, president of Thirst Aid Inc.,
which is renting the device to
vendors.

Made of molded plastic-like
material, it looks and is worn like
a back-pack and can be filled
with coffee, hot chocolate, beer
or other beverages, Billet said.
His company has leased more
than 150 of the tanks to Wagon-
Wheel Concessions Ltd., which
is providing food services at the
Olympic games.

The president of Wagon—Wheel
said his workers have been using
the tanks to sell coffee and hot
chocolate outdoors where fans
have been braving frigid temper-
atures.

”On cold days, they've been
fabulous," said Gary Gladman.
He said sports enthusiasts at the
Olympics like the ”drink tanks”
because they can get hot drinks
without leaving the competition
sites.

La wyers squa wk over
post-accident tests

PHILADELPHIA — A prosecu-
tor and a defense lawyer disagree
about the importance of post-
accident tests that officials said
showed marijuana in the system
of an Amtrak switchman whose
actions led to the Jan. 29 der '-
ment of a passenger train.

The issue is a three—day delay
between the accident and the tak-
ing of blood and urine samples
from the control tower operator,
Thomas Connor, 30, of Aldan,
Pa. Connor's lawyer says the tests
don't matter, and a local prose-
cutor says they will be part of his
investigation.

”It doesn't change our position
one bit,” Connor's attorney, Ar-
thur Donato, said of the test
results announced Tuesday b
the Federal Railroad Adminig

tration.

was among the nearly 150 com-
munity members who attended
the hearing. He said he was
pleased with the hearing results.

Forrester said, ”We got what
we wanted. These guys are out of
jeopardy.”

The defendants signed a
release of civil liability for mem-
bers of the city police force as
part of the plea—bargaining
process, and a drug—possession
and an underage drinking charge
against two defendants were
withdrawn. Magistrate Edward
Borkowski said the ”('ase was
treated as any other case," and to

the represented parties, he said,
’’I think you’ve been fairly
treated.”

The magistrate concluded that
there was some factual basis for
the police reports.

However, according to For-
rester, the process is not over.
Forrester said, ”We didn't lose.

There are still things that can be -

done.”

Arjcording to representatives of

ticipate in the case.

and letters are not necessarily those of The Pitt News. Editorials expressed

The FBI gets its

pristine hands dirty

It happened. They went over the edge. The confession of a
man suspected of masterminding the I985 hijacking of an
American plane and the subsequent destruction of that plane
has been thrown out of court because the FBI used — gasp!
—-— ”relentless interrogation” to obtain the confession.

The interrogation in question, which was conducted aboard
a Navy vessel, resulted in two fractured wrists for the accused,
Fawaz Younis. It apparently took the interrogators four days
to decide that the man might be in need of medical attention,
four days that produced a written confession to the hijacking.

U.S. Districtludge Barrington D. Parker should be commend-
ed for refusing to admit the confessions as evidence in the tri-
al. When the law enforecement officers of the United States
find it appropriate to maim a suspect to get a confession, it
should come as little surprise that terrorism against the United

_ States is on the rise. Under an administration citing human rights

abuses as justification for assisting in the murder of civilians,
such methods of information gathering do make some sense,
in a twisted sort of way.

Again, the point is being made that the meanness of the me-
ans is consistantly justified by the ends in what currently pass-
es for democracy in America. The FBI, which could stand for
Fanatically Brutal Investigators, should learn a lesson from all
this, if such a miracle is even possible.

 
 

 

James Crary is a storyteller, and

a bad one at that. His piece enti-

tled ”Muslims are being

harassed” (Feb. 15) should be la- .

beled delusional fiction, not [a
column]. In a rather skewed man-
ner, relying on false allegations
and blatant inaccuracies, Crary
tries to describe the political sit-
uation in the State of Israel.

For the record, let us get the
facts straight. Simple Boolean
logic is a good approach. First er-
ror, Jimbo; Palestinian and Mus-
lim are not interchangeable. Bad,
bad assumption. Some Muslims
are Palestinians. Some Palestini-
ans are Muslims, too (about two-
thirds). But not all Palestinians are
Muslims. Go back to elementary
algebra and do not pass go. Be-
lieve it or not, some Palestinians
adhere to other faiths, including
Christianity, Druze and Bahai,
among others.

Second, implying that Israel has
a genocidal policy toward Mus-
lims is preposterous if not slan-
derous. Israel is a tiny little
country about the size of New
Jersey, surrounded by a litany
[sic] of hostile Arab states. Israel's
main concern is survival, includ-
ing security for her borders and
protection for her people. More
than once, the consortium of
neighboring Arab states have
pledged unity in their efforts
toward driving the Israelis into
the Mediterranian and destroying
the State of Israel. Who, may I
ask, is advocating genocide?

In contrast, Israel has demon-
strated her willingness to negoti-
ate peaceful settlements. The
Camp David accord, a truly
historic document signed by both

LETTERS

Israel and Egypt, resulted in the
return of the Sinai Penninsula in
exchange for lasting peace. If you
recall, as the result of this initia-
tive, Egypt was castigated by the
Arab League and isolated from
the Arab world. Furthermore, one
of the treaty’s principal initiators,
Anwar Sadat, president of Egypt,
was assassinated by Muslim ex-
tremists for trying to achieve
peace. [...]

Let us turn to the political
process in Israel. I am sorry, but
you erred here once again. Elec-
tions are nationwide, and all Is-
raeli citizens, whether Muslim,
Jewish, Christian, etc., are enti-
tled to vote. All Palestinians
have/hadthe option of becoming
Israeli citizens, but they must
recognize and pledge allegiance
to the State of Israel. This isn't all
that different from becoming a
citizen of the United States. Most
Palestinians do not take this oath,
of course, because they are com-
mitted to the destruction of Israel.
Interestingly enough, for the past
20 years, the proportion of Arab-
Israeli citizens casting votes in
general elections was higher than
those cast by Jewish—Israelis.

Beyond this, you are gravely
mistaken about the practice of
religion in Israel. You would be
hard—pressed to find a more toler-
ant society than Israel in which to
follow one’s faith. Not a single
religion is repressed, nor are its
members persecuted for their be-
liefs. Israel is an important center
to many religions, including

 

CoNoRoN

Column too close to left field

Christianity, Judaism, Muslim.
[...]

The bottom line is that misin-
formation is a very dangerous
tool, Mr. Crary. Thank God we

Sitting back to wait

In response to the article on
CALA’s fight for inclusion of a
sexual-orientation anti-
discrimination clause in the
university's EOS, we would like
to point out a very important
oversight by all involved. The ar-
gument is mute [sic].

The university only has to ad-
dress possible discrimination
problems in its EOS. A student's
sexuality is never questioned by
the university on applications or
any other forms. On the other
hand, the university does ask for
the gender of the student in its ad-
missions applications, and it is
therefore necessary to include an
anti-discrimination clause in the
EOS about the sex of the appli-
cant. Nowhere must an applicant
include his sexual preference
and, therefore, there is no need
to have a clause. In the law this
translates to be a ”mute [sic]
point,” but at Pitt, it seems to
translate as wasted time.

We're going to sit back and see
how long it takes the SGB and
Dr. Posvar to open up a law book
and find the precendent which
rules such a case and states it is

Like lemmings to the sea

PAIII. ANATER

THE NAKED CITY

On Monday, Feb. 22, The Pitt
News ran an article called "In
Search of an Apartment.”

Said article was filled with
quotes of bright-eyed, bushy-
tailed dorm residents who are
embarking on their quest for their
first apartment

fllztneat Eﬁmptnr
One soon-to-be apartment
dweller said something along the
lines of, "I want to find an ‘ideal’
apartment  "

Who the hell wouldn't?

I have been looking for an
abode with a working fireplace,
hardwood floors, plaster walls,
on-site laundry, a porch, a mani-
cured lawn complete with topi-
ary and a few lawn ornaments
(two deer, a big toadstool and an
elf or two hiding amid the canes
of a forsythia), mature shade, hot
and cold running water, con-
cerned landlords, quiet neighbors
and southern exposure. I've been
searching ever since I saw a pho-
tograph of it in Architectural
Digest three years ago.

The closest I've come to this
pad '0 my dreams is where I live
now. I have lights that turn on
when I flip a switch, and the
refrigerator works from time to
time. Ya know, there's nothing
better than life in the lap of
luxury.

Another gentleman said that he
was moving out of a building
owned by one of the multi-
national conglomerates in South
Oakland. He said he was tired of

The collegiate right

In response to William Young's
column "Are the homeless the
problem?” (Feb. 24)

Are the homeless the problem?
Or is the problem a new collegi-
ate right whose rank-and—file
membership, secure in the
warmth of their three-room flats,
munch microwave popcorn and
make sweeping generalizations
propagating completely unsub-
stantiated misnomers without bat-
ting an eye?

No, I've never been hungry or
homeless, and my billfold bulges
with plastic credit. I have no ties
to the New Student Network, and
I'd hardly suggest that anyone
should be afforded a free meal
ticket (even you, Mr. Young).

But poverty is an issue of huge
dimension, a structure with foun-
dations laid intricately in the
groundwork of capitalism. Squat-
ting in a hut on the Cathedral

‘lawn is no solution to a dynamic

the shoddy maintenance per-
formed by the baboons who are
employed by the multi-national
conglomerate. He said, "Private
landlords can give you more per-
sonal attention.”

Yeah, sure. Personal scorn is
more likely.

Last year, I lived in a third sto-
ry rat's nest on Dawson St. It was
owned by a sweet, middle—aged
man named Dante, and main-
tained by his even sweeter
daughter who had an even more
frighteningly demonic name. This
emptor should have caveated as
soon as he met those two, but he
didn't.

By November, the sweet
daughter had earned the nick-
name "The Evil One.”

Witness this "personal at-
tention."

For starters, the fuse box was
located in the basement of the
house.

The basement door was kept
locked, and whenever we blew
a fuse, we had to call The Evil
One, and she would drive over,
and turn the switch in the fuse-
box. It lived in Gibsonia, though.

It was funny how Gibsonia
seemed to be a six—hour drive
from Oakland.

I found out later that the reason
for the locked basement door was
to keep those darn fire inspectors
out.

I still see my old neighbors
from time to time (they still live
in that den of sorrows) and they
told me that the building was fi-

nally inspected two months ago,
and the demonic duo were fined
heavily for blatant violations. I'm
still smiling.

"I consider dorm life a hassle,”
said another potentially erstwhile
dorm resident.

If dorm life is a hassle, try get-
ting a security deposit back
sometime.

For that matter, try this, "Hel-
lo, [landlord's name]? This is [ten-
nant's name], our toilet backed
up just now, and I had to wade
through seven feet of untreated
sludge to get to the phone. Could
you send a plumber over
sometime?"

"Click."

That may be a slight exaggera-
tion, but I have been trying to get
my current landlord to replace
the seal on my toilet since Sep-
tember. I have no doubt that
when I pay the rent next week
that I'll make the same request,
and they'll say "We'll have the
handyman stop over by Friday."

Oh, it's really not so bad, I
guess. I'm learning to tolerate the
smell of eau de toilet.

I did the same thing.

I had to learn the hard way that
many landlords not only want
your money, they want your
blood, soul and first-born.

One Jodi Braden gets a prize
for intelligence. Her quote: "I
want an apartment in good con-
dition that’s well taken care of by
a reputable landlord who already
has satisfied tenants.”

Follow her advice, open your
mouths and ask questions. Open
your eyes and read the lease.

Your first apartment can be
tolerable, but it can also turn into
a nightmare. This is the real
world, and as such requires a
realistic approach.

problem — I doubt NSN portrays
it to be so. Yet an immeasurably
worse course of action is the turn-
ing of our collective head ——- out
of ignorance or hostility or fear or
guilt.

NSN's demonstration suggests
awareness and study could lead
to the recovery of our country's
burgeoning population of home-
less. The task is certain to be long
and arduous; during the interim,
there are those whose humane-
ness will prompt them to attend
to the ugly, repercussions of this
societal disorder.

To them should be addressed
not contempt, but gratitude.

John Thompson wronged_____

I am writing in response to the
editorial "Destroy(a) Hoya?"
which appeared on Monday,
Feb. 22. I am not condoning vio-
lence of any kind in competitive
sports, but for someone to infer
or suggest that coach John
Thompson specifically teaches
dirty basketball is very disap-
pointing, and to print such non-
sense also shows the
incompetence and bias of the
editorial board.

John Thompson is a very de-

cent and successful basketball
coach who teaches his players to
play aggressively, and that is one
of the reasons why he is going to
coach the U.S. Olympic team this
summer; as to suggest that he is
a dirty coach raises questions
about the decision of the U.S.
Olympic Committee.

Surely, anybody who under-
stands competitive sport knows
that tensions run high during the
big matchups, and no coach tells
his pupils to go out there and play
dirty. If we begin to judge
coaches on the basis of how
many fights their players are in-
volved in, then we would first
crucify Chuck Daly of the Detroit
Pistons of the NBA. ,

I think you owe coach Thomp-
son an apology; if he was a vio-
lent coach, he wouldn't have
condemned the violence of last
Saturday, and I don't think the
U.S. Olympic Committee would
have chosen him the coach of the
U.S. team this year. Because you
have the opportunity to write
your views does not allow you
the power to write inflammatory
remarks intended to fuel bad
blood between Pitt and Geor-
getown students.

Coming home in
a drunken stupor

Ashes to ashes
Dust to dust
If the liquor doesn't get you
The women must.

Well! I never!

This little quote came my
way as I sat in one of my
literature classes and dis-
cussed a poem from the
Romantic era of Slovak his-
tory. We were talking about
the religious connotations
of this selection and the
symbolism that certain lines
and words held. This was
all fine and good until we

got to this one particular 

[me w

"...It is an angel garbed in dust!" Great. A line from the 185th
stanza of Andrej Sladkovic's "Marina."

"Now what does that mean to you?" asks my prof. Classic
question — no sweat. One of those questions that you can say
almost anything and it sounds OK. I formulated a response.

"Maybe it means that even though we try to retain our youth
we still will ultimately return to ashes. You know, ashes to ash-
es, dust to dust, that kind of stuff?" I said.

The professor looked and me said "Hmmmm. Yes, I can see
that." Then he started to rattle off this little ditty about liquor
and women.

I'm kind of surprised. To tell the truth, this is the first time
I've ever encountered this one.

"Sure, that's what I meant, I guess," I said. Everyone else in
the class seemed to be just about as surprised, but we laughed
it off and continued with our discussion. Still, I think about this
clever poem. Where in the world did it come from? Moreover,
where did the last two lines come from?

As I thought about this through the remainder of the class,
I wondered if these words held any water. At first, I thought,
"no" But the more I consider what might be behind this fine
selection of certain parts of the English language, I become
afraid. What if women really are "what gets you?" Before all
of my semi-feminist beliefs go kaplooie, however, I feel it's time
to analyze this problem at hand and come up with a reasona-
ble solution that may satisfy both the male and female gender.

Now. These lines (yes, the last two of this ditty) could be taken
in two different ways.

Number one: From a man's point of view (?) —— If I don't stay
out at the bar with the guys enjoying myself while drinking as
much as I want to, getting as drunk as I want to, I'm going to
have to go home to my wife (girlfriend, lover, etc.) and deal
with her nagging. Which is the worse of the two evils?

Number two: From a female’s point of view (I) —— The guys
go out to the bars. Their wives (girlfriends, lovers, etc.) know
they intend on drinking. However, if these men would happen
to get drunk and not end up at someone else's home (hopeful-
ly one of the guys they went out with) besides their own (or
in the police station or God knows where) the women know
they will end up dealing with their counterparts in their drunken
stupor. Oh, boy. Let's talk about a fun evening.

I have promised that I would try to have this situation satisfy
both sides of the gender wheel. If you might think that either
one of these above instances is unfair, just switch all the "guys"
to "girls" and vice—versa. See, wasn't that easy. We still do have
this little ditty to totally develop, though.

In all actuality, I have no fears that women are any kind of
traumatic happening to personkind. Granted, it is assumed that
we are more emotional when dealing with life in general, but,
contrary to popular belief, I have run across many a man that
has the same kind of responses that many women are charac-
terised as having when they are "rubbed the wrong way." Could
there be any truth in this? Or is it just my imagination? ‘

OK. Enough of this stuff. How about the history of the ditty?
Where could something this profound possibly have come
from? From the bar? From a game of poker? Or from women
plain talking over the fence (Since I imagine that it came to light
before there were phones). I guess we'll never know but it could
be fun to think about. Som "rig to fill up your spare time.

  

Jun:

If anyone hasn't been just completely humored with this dit-
ty, I don't see how that could have happened. I think the best
way to look at this cute little poem is just on a superficial level.
In all reality, it's no fun to tear it to pieces. It's something fun.
It's something different. It's a little ditty Go ahead, laugh at it
and enjoy it —— it'll be great to see a few more smiles in the
dead of winter.

Approximately 1,000 stu-
dents from over 600 colleges
and universities will serve in-
ternships in the nation's
capitol this year through the
Washington Center, according
to Angela Iovino, internship
program manager.

Founded in 1975, the
Washington Center is the lar-
gest independent, non—profit
organization that enables stu-
dents to earn credit from their
own colleges and universities
while engaging in practical
work experience, according to
lovino.

"A typical day would con-
sist of working for a congres-
sional caucus, senator or
congressman,” said lovino.

In addition to political
science, law, business, inter-
national affairs and govern-
ment, participants may be
studying journalism, art, biol-
ogy, sociology, communica-

tions, physics or
environmental science.
”Although students often fall

under the spell of Washington
politics once they arrive, what
brings people here is the
promise of working with the
leaders and current issues in
every field,” reads the Center's
guidebook.

The four major parts to a stu-
dent's intership are the intern-
ship itself, an academic
speaker series, two guest
speaker series and peer-group
discussion sessions.

All of the internships earn

Interns gain valuable experience

academic credit through the
student's college or university.

The two newest programs
with the Center are the Intern-
ship lnitiative in the Indepen-
dent Sector and the
Telecommunications Pro-
gram. Other programs include
Arts and Communications,
Business, Congressional
Offices and Committees,
Defense Policy, Environment,
Foreign Policy, Health, Inter-
national Business, Law, Polit-
ical Organizations, Public
Interest, Sciences, Social Re-
habilitation/Counseling and
Women's Issues.

cations may be obtained from

Study focuses on

mnemonic technique“

By Mindy Boffemmyer
Staff Writer

Nearly every beginning music
student has memorized ”Every
Good Boy Does Fine,” to help
them learn the notes on the line
of the treble clef. This process is
known as a mnemonic aid and is
the subject of current research at
Pitt and around the country.

One researcher, Pitt graduate
student Mark Detweiler, defines
a mnemonic aid as ”any tech-
nique that you can use to boost
memory, ranging from notes on
paper to coming up with rhymes
to elaborate techniques such as
peg words where a student as-
sociates a word with an image in
his mind in order to help him

remember the word.”

Independent research of
mnemonic aids is also being con-
ducted by Professor Gregory
Aloia of Geneseo, N.Y.

’’l have been fascinated by how
students go about learning at all
levels -— from grade school
through college — and by thﬁi
types of memory aids they have
developed in their studies,” Aloia
said.

Aloia is questioning college
students throughout the country
on their study habits and tech-
niques.

’’I know a lot of people who
use mnemonic aids,” Detweiler
said, ”especia|ly medical and
dental students who have a lot of

terms and formulas to
remember.”

Engineering Studen§,
Christopher Maziarz finds

mnemonic aids ”very helpful.”

”My calculus professor taught
us a way to remember the natur-
al log of E, which is
27182818289045. All you have
to do is remember the number
two, then remember that seven is
the professor's favorite number,
1828 is the year of Andrew Jack-
son's innauguration, and think of
a 90-45 triangle and you can
remember the whole number.”

Other examples of mnemonic
aids employed by students may
include ‘'1 before E except after
C” and ”Karl Plays Chess On
Fancy Green Squares” to remem-
ber the biological taxonomy clas-
sifications Kingdom, Phylum,
Class, Order, Family, Genus and
Species.

Pre-med student Larry Shrana-
tan explained a mnemonic aid he
used to remember a chemistry
equation. The variables in the
equation were R, U and C, so he
was able to remember them be-
cause they ”just happened to
spell the word rug.”

”Usually when I use mnemon-
ic aids I think of acronyms for
whatever I am trying to remem-
ber,” Shranatan said.

Freshman Michael Lingo com-
mented that ”even though peo-
ple do use mnemonic aids, unless
they can think of something em-
barrassing or funny to associate
things with, they always end up

forgetting them.” 03

Fartsand loathing on the musiccensorsp trail

Cy Matthew Thornton

Contributing Editor

The job of the citizen is to keep
his mouth open.
—- Cunter Crass

Tonight, Frank Zappa will play
the Syria Mosque with an
11—piece band. The show will
start at 8 p.m.

Refreshments, alas, will not be
Qrved.

Assuming that the venerable
Mr. Zappa has not planned a
revolution for his performance for
the Pittsburgh show, the music
should be mixed with a healthy

dose of political commentary.

What if Pat gets in The White
House/ And suddenly/ The rights
of certain people disappear/ M ys—
teriousIy/ Wouldn’t that sort of
quaIify/ As an American Tragedy

These lyrics from the song le-
sus Thinks You're a jerk, as well
as a plethora of others just as
amusing, promise to keep the
sensibilities of the audience
properly abraded.

We got a fusebox and we're gonna blow it

The Affordable Floors’ loss is the rest
of the world’s gain! Ex—Floors guitarist
Steve Morrison, along with ex-North By
Northwest front man, John Young, have
united to form Fusebox. They'll be tight-
ening up the act at a few parties around
town and making as official debut in mid-
March 

Well, no one official has been availa-
ble to quell the rumor that Husker Du has
broken up  The new Robert Plant song
”Heaven Knows” is best described as
”pathetic”. The guitar, attributed to Jim-
my Page (eek!) is so far back in the mix
it could have recorded over the phone.
You should dig out the old Donna Sum-
mer single of the same name. If Bob's
”Heaven” really rates the 4 stars Rolling
Stone gave it, Donna's earns about 12-15
stars

Joe Strummer finally quit calling him-
self The Clash and is touring with The
Pogues. The Pogues, incidentally are now
permitted to use their original name,

weekend at the Electric Bannana. Laurels

Volpe. Take a break from touring a play
around here more often often, guys! 

On the vinyl frontier: The Birdhouse,
a British band I want to know more about,
have a fierce LP called ”Burning Up”.
Don't let the song titles like ”Die Baby
Die”, ”Suck This, Bitch”, and ”My
Wicked Way” scare you away. Well,
maybe if you're that easily frightened you
should listen to Wild Ones’ Crossroads
(Pow Wow). This is one electric heap o’

tunes. Their sound runs the gamut from
silky R&B to wild rockabilly. the fact that
they cover such diverse songs as ”Lust For
Life” and ’’Got My Moio Workin”’ 

Sonic Youth’s latest 12” is a parody of
everything sacred to the musical under-
ground. On one 12” record, the Youth
manage to make off beat references to Big

vaguely traditional. Shake that founda-

Sonic Youth’s Master-Dik beats on the weasel

Sonic Youth
”Master Dik”
S S T

Sonic Youth, the New York
City quartet whose music has
been described as anything from
an explosion in a guitar factory to
a skull—rattling aural vortex, has
just released a new 12" single
called Master Dik on SST
Records. Living up to these
descriptions and then some, the
critically acclaimed Sonic Youth
have revealed their often hidden
sense of humor and laid down
some intense music in the
process.

On both sides of the inner
sleeve of their 12" are photo-
graphs in which they purposeful-
ly appear to be a wasted 60’s
psych band. On one side,
though, is a scorching assertain—
ment of underground music by a
bitter Ben Weasel of the mucic
publication MAXIMUM
R O C K N R O L L.

He professes that groups like
R.E.M., The Replacements,
Husker Du and Sonic Youth per-
form ”total bullshit music” and
that ”Sonic Youth and Husker Du
will be the Yes and REO Speed-
wagon of the 90's.” Quite an
amazing claim from someone
that few have ever heard of.

Sonic Youth has obviously
taken these words to heart and
had one of the biggest laughs of
their ”elitist, post-punk” lives.
Their new 12" more than an-

swers these unfounded allega-
tions and does so with a scalding
sense of humor.

The record kicks off with the
hard-edged rap title song that, by
direct comparison,makes the
Beastie Boys look like Barry
Manilow. Sonic Youth raps their
way through a travelogue of their
version of New York City.

Throughout they invoke
Madonna's maiden name,
reminding the listener that

Master Dik sounds more akin to
the good—natured slaughtering of
Madonna's songs by Sonic
Youth’s alter-ego Ciccone Youth
than the Youth themselves. This
doesn't sound like a band that
likes to ”sing about shit that no
one understands.”

The next cut is a not so surpris-
ing departure for Sonic Youth: a
very straight-foreward cover of
the Ramones' ”Beat on the Brat”.
The band preserves the mood
and the spirit of the Ramones’
original while adding its own
unique sound they characterized
on Sister. Does this mean that
Sonic Youth has given up the
music that made them famous?
Not quite.

The second song on side two
is an amalgamation of bits and
pieces from their closet of bones
segued together, having much
the same effect as the Beatles’
Revolution 9. ”lntroducing the
Stars” is a funny bit of studio non-
sense and ”Funky Fresh” is a
hilarious rambling much in the
same pseudo-rap vein as

”Master Dik”.

The most interesting thing
about this noise painting is that,
although it is sometimes silly, it
offers subtle nuances after repeat-
ed listenings. One of the finest
parts of this suite is ”Chinese
Jam”. It is a typical Sonic Youth
altered-tuning guitar test that is
reminiscent to Chinese orchestra
music or Adrian Belew attacking
attacking a koto with kitchen
utensils.

Without reading Ben Weasel’s

causitc comments, one might not
understand what Sonic Youth is
trying to accomplish by doing a
Ramones cover and a rap song.
After reading, it becomes clear
that the humor is well directed.
”Master"‘Dik” and ”Beat on the
Brat” stand quite well on their
own merits and, in a way, prove
that Ben Weasel is the only one
who is, in his own words, ”real-
ly boring and pretentious.”

Zappa

Continued from page 7
labeling debate than through the
pages of the music press.

He has gone head to head with
Tipper Core of the Parent's Mus-
ic Resource Center over that
group's proposal to label albums
they considered offensive. Zappa
approached the argument with a
disarming combination of elo-
quence, vulgarity and commit-
ment to freedom of expression
that has been quoted more often,
probably, than another auspi-
cious entertainer, the erstwhile
”great communicator."

”Dead” is the word Zappa uses
to describe the present condition
of the PMRC.

Illlill

Three years ago, Zappa told his
audience that his days with ”the
boys in the crew” were over. He
had laid aside his guitar, he said,
and holed up with a state-of-the-
art synclavier and his magazine
subscriptions. But, alas, ”Broad-
way the Hardway” is on the road,
and both the guitar and the syn-
clavier are polished up and ready
to play.

Due to the size of the band,
some of the more complex
rhythms and Stravinskyesque dis-
sonances woven through Zappa’s
most recent recordings will be
possible. The horn section —
Walt Fowler, trumpet — Bruce
Fowler, trombone — Paul Carman,
alto and baritone sax - Albert
Wing, tenor sax, and Kurt Mcget—
trick, bass sax and contrabass
clarinet —- has a lineup to rival
any other currently on the road.

The rest of the band — Scott
Thunes, bass — Chad Wackerman,
drums - Bobby Martin, keyboards
and vocals - Ed Mann, percussion
— Ike Willis, guitar and vocals and
Mike Keneally, described in the
press information as a "stunt
guitarist” —— provide the rest of
the talent necessary for this year's

A Touch of Worth Avenue in Pittsburgh

music from a man with over 50
LP jackets in his scrapbook.

Over the 20-year course of his
career, Zappa, 47, has covered a
diverse range of media and styles,
melding fusion and rock with so-
cial commentary and scratchy,
urban (not to be confused with
urbane) blues.

Along the way, he has had a
few hits of the radio, Top-40
”gee, who is this guy, he's total-
ly cool” variety, among which
are Valley Girl and a song urging
us not to ”eat that yellow snow.”

Those songs, though entertain-
ing, are hardly representative of
the vast body of work Zappa has
produced. With occasional
lapses into pure comedy, (/oefs
Garage) which have a feel of
necessity about them, Zappa has
used virtually every album to ex-
plore untried possibilities of tech-
nology and composition.

Enough said about the music.
As Billy Joel reminded us, ”you
can't get the sound from a story
in a magazine.” Seeing him in
concert will say more about his
music than any contortions of
language that might be per-
formed here.

Zappa, a promoter of the drug-
free life and seemingly aware of
the adage concerning growing
grass, has kept himself busy with
a number of other successful bus-
iness concerns. His record com-
pany, Barking Pumpkin
(distributed by Capitol), is doing
well. Its catalogue contains Zap-
pa’s last seven years of work as
well as albums by other musi-
cians, including one by his son,
Dweezil.

His newest enterprise, Honker
Home video, was created to pro-
mote and distribute ”state-of-the-
art weirdness” in film. Through
it, material that wouldn't other-
wise be accessible in other video
and television markets is being
released on a national scale.

Although some of his material
can be forthrightly obscene at
times, one never has the feeling
that vulgarity is included only for
its shock value. Like any social
commentator, he uses the lan-

guage to which his audience can
best relate.

Get your hands on one of his
albums and give it a listen.
Whatever musical genre you find
most comfortable, Zappa has
probably fused it into something
at least as interesting. ”lnnova—
tion,” he says, ”is the only tena-
ble pursuit for the artist.”

Black Flag
Wasted  Again
SST

Welcome to the world of Black

. Flag, one of the few bands that's

managed to have punks, cops, TV
cameras, reporters and a helecoo
ter in one audience all waiting for
a riot.

Their eight-year mission to dis-
rupt the minds of the world be-
gan in 1978 with their now
infamous Nervous Breakdown
EP. From that point on, Greg Finn
piloted the piledriving Black Flag
through multiple personnel
changes as well as riots and law
suits concerning a certain bug-
spray of the same name.

Throughout its career, Black
Flag has evolved from the punk
rock partiers of its larval stage to
the full tilt, two—headed metallic
monster ofAnnihi/ate This Week.
Although Black Flag is most well-
known for their paean to the idi-
ot box, ‘TV. Party,” from the
Repo Man soundtrack, they have
produced a mass of work that is
stunning in its ferocity.

For those who are uninitiated
into the wonders of Black Flag,
Wasted Again comes as a well-
chosen primer. For those who
have known Black Flag for years,
this recent compilation of greatest
hits serves to remind that Black
Flag was a prototype for many of
today's hardcore bands. Wasted
 Again cranks out non-stop,

aying the venom of Black Flag ’

crunching rock tunes fr()m their
various albums and EPs.

Wasted Again kicks off with
the original version of the often-
covered ”Wasted” from Nervous
Breakdown. Next is the
Damaged mix of ‘TV. Party,”
which is noticably different from
the take on the Repo Man sound-
track. Two Black Flag classics,
"Six Pack” and ”the riot song for
all ages” —— ”Louie Louie” —— are
taken from their more rocking
single versions.

The liner notes on the back of
the sleeve describe ”Six Pack” as
being about 348 proof; it's quite
possible they've underestimated.

From the more studio—slick
Henry Rollins—era Black Flag
comes ”Annihilate,” ”Loose
Nut,” ”Drinking and Driving”
and the tongue—in-cheek, ”Slip It
In.”

In one way, Wasted  Again
can be seen as a closed book
since Black Flag broke up in
1986. In another way, it can be
seen as a starting point since
Black Flag has spawned several
spinoffs in its eight—year history
including Gone, October Fac-
tion, Black Flag vocalist’s Dez
Cadena’s D.C.-3 and the Henry
Rollins Band.

Black Flag's music, great as it
is, is only a stepping stone to
what will come in the future. In
the mean time, Wasted Again

THE PITT NEWS

Fra wle y named All-American by magazine

By Don Boyd
Staff Writer

Denise Frawley’s standout play
on the volleyball court has
earned the 5-foot-10 outside-
hitter national recognition.
Volleyball Monthly recently
selected their All-American team,
and Denise received honorable
mention designation.

Frawley found out about the
accolade while on the way to
practice. Her coach, Shelton Col-
lier, showed her the latest issue
of Volleyball Monthly , which
featured their All-American
selections.

Frawley was elated over her
selection. ’’I didn't expect it. I

was really surprised. That says a
lot about our program,” she said.

If not for a streak of good luck,
Collier may never have recruited
the Thornwood, N.Y., native,
who starred at Westlake High
School

”I first found out about Denise
when I was recruiting another
player in her area. I heard about
her and asked her to send a video
tape. On the tape, she spiked
several balls. I never saw anyone
we ever recruited who was that
impressive at that young of age,”
said Collier.

Fraw|ey’s freshman year at Pitt
was one of Pitt's worst years ever.
As Collier remembers, "That
year, we were depending on a lot

of young players. Denise per-
formed fairly well, but I think she
and the other young players just
were not ready to win.”

The past two seasons, Denise
has played a key role in the Lady
Panthers’ success. As a sopho-
more, Denise was named All-Big
East team as well as being select-
ed to the All—Northeast regional
team. Pitt was selected to partic-
ipate in the NCAA tournament
and finished the year 28-13.

This year, as a junior, Denise's
performance on the court was
even stronger. In addition to
repeating All-Big East and All-
Northeast region honors, she was
named Big East Player of the
Year. Frawley registered 444 kills

Matured Santoro in searh of dream season

R. Sc C rnohon/The Pitt News
Pat Santoro currently leads the EWL in scoring with 43 points through five mallchoes this season.

Thursday, February 25, I988

while helping Pitt to its second
consecutive appearance in the
NCAA tournament and a 37-6
record.

She was recently contacted by
the U.S. National Team about try-
ing out for the team, as a result
of her strong play in the Nation-
al Sports Festival the last two
years. Denise turned down the
invitation. With an arthritic con-
dition in both of her feet, she
thought the rigors of national
team training would severely test
the limitations of her feet.

As for Frawley’s senior year at
Pitt, Collier feels she has an ex-
cellent chance of becoming Pitt's
first All-American volleyball play-
er for a number of reasons.

By Vince Carey

Assistant Sports Editor

Not too many athletes have the
ability to dominate a sporting
event. Jerome Lane can take over
a basketball game, but not all of
the time. Craig Heyward can
sometimes do the same thing in
a football game, but, again, not
all of the time.

Pitt's All-American wrestler, Pat
Santoro, is a little different. He
has the ability to dominate a
nzatch every time he steps onto
the mat.

Santoro is 40-0 on the season
and ranked No. 1 in the nation at
the 142-pound division.

A few weeks ago, Santoro
squared off against the No. 2
wrestler in his weight class, Edin-
boro’s Sean O’Day, at the Na-

tional Wrestling Coaches
Association’s annual All-Star
Meet.

Santoro won the match by a
score of 16-10. Even though the
score appeared to be close, all of
those who watched the match
claimed that Santoro totally
dominated it.

Santoro was the tournament
champion in the West Virginia
Open, the Ohio Open, the Lock
Haven Invitational, the Las Vegas
Invitational and the Midlands
Tournament.

In less than three years of col-
legiate wrestling, Santoro has a
109-8 record.

’’I had no idea that I'd be do-
ing this well,” Santoro said. ”[Be-
ing undefeated] was definitely a
goal of mine before the season.
I just tried to take one match at
a time, and not get ahead of
myself."

During the off season, Santoro
likes to keep up with his
wrestling.

’’I don't wrestle as well as I
would like to during the sum-
mer,” Santoro said. ’’I work out
all year. During the summer I do
more coaching and teaching.

.”Summer wrestling is freestyle,
and I'm not that good at freestyle.
You take a lot of lumps wrestling
that way.”

Santoro graduated from Bethle-
hem Catholic High School and

”First, she was one of the few
non—senior players who was
given notoriety on the All-
American team. Secondly, she
will have an opportunity to prove
herself against top-flight compe-
tition. Next year, we will play
possibly 14 teams that will be
ranked in the top 20. And'last|y,
in Jenelle Lantagne, we feel that
we have a setter capable of mak-
ing Denise look very good as an
outside-hitter,” observed Collier.

The Pitt coach feels that the
stage is set for Frawley to excel.
”The only missing ingredient is
how well Denise plays next year.
And I think she is ready," said

Please see Frawley, page 17

attended a year at Blair Academy
before coming to Pitt.

‘'1 did good in high school, but
I also attended Blair Academy for
a year before college," Santoro
said. ”It was for academics as
well as wrestling. I think that is
where I got more help.”

After looking into a number of
schools, Santoro decided on Pitt.

”Not a lot of people were in-
terested in me early in my
career,” Santoro said. ”I was
looking into Penn State and Le-
high the most, but eventually set-
tled on Pitt. I came here for a visit
and liked everything I saw. Itvhad
a lot to offer academically, and
the wrestling program was start-
ing to rise.”

Although Santoro had the
potential his freshman year, Pitt
coach Rande Stottlemyer still had
a lot of work to do with him.

”His freshman year, Pat was a
little immature,” Stottlemyer said.
”Like when he would lose, it
would just kill him. Sometimes
he would show his frustration in
an unpleasant way. He would
throw his headgear around or
something like that.

”Not because he was trying to
show off to somebody, he honest-
ly and truly was upset with him-
self losing. Like in the Nationals,
he was an All-American as a
freshman, he got pinned twice
and lost to another guy 15-7 and
he was really ticked. He ended
up sixth in the country. For a
freshman to finish that high is
really good, but he was really up-
set with himself.’ He has really
matured since then as a person
and a wrestler.”

Santoro finished his freshman
year with a record of 30-6.

Last year, Santoro finished with
a record of 39-2 and reached the
finals of the NCAA tournament
only to be pinned by Pete Yazzo
of Lehigh.

”Pat was upset after the loss
and he took it real hard," Stott-
lemyer said. ”He didn't show that
immature frustration. There is a
right and a wrong way to handle
a loss; he learned that his fresh-
man year. This year he hasn’t. had

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, February 25, T988

Versatile Pfister helps swim team

By Kelly Witt

Staff Writer

After to years of competitive
swimming, Jody Pfister is ready to
trade in his goggles for a drawing
board.

Pfister, a 22-year-old senior
from Bethel Park, Pa., is a studio
arts major with an emphasis in
studio design.

Pfister plans to graduate in De-
cember and get a job with The
Graphic Arts Technical Founda-
tion, where he plans to have an
internship over the summer.

Pfister is a versatile swimmer,
adding some much-needed depth
to the men's team. ’’I swim most-
ly sprints, but I don't have a par-
ticular ’be.st’ event. I seem to be
able to handle my share in the
sprints. l also swim butterfly,”
said Pfister.

”We put Jody in a lot of relays
l)(‘( ause he's a freestyler and
helps get needed points," said
first year assistant coach Bob
(ilemmer,

”We’ve changed the training
program a lot this year. It's not
what he's used to. It’s a lot hard-
er. But, he never complains, not
even in the weight room. This
training has made him more suc-
cessful. He's having his best sea-
son ever," he continued.

"Everyone looks up to Jody be-
cause he is such a hard worker.
He will do anything for the
benefit of the team. Jody is a great
person to train with,” said senior
teammate Geoff Rife.

According to Pfister, the most
memorable thing that's happened
during his career at Pitt is losing
to Penn State in his sophomore
year.

The meet was tied until the last
event, the 4()()-yard freestyle re-
lay, which Pfister am hored. lle
swam against a high school rival,
and lost.

"It's something I won't forget.
Nobody likes to lose to Penn
State. Sometimes negative things
can have a positive influence I
say that because of how we
bounced back the next year and
beat them at Penn State,” said
Pfister.

Ironically, Pfister had intended
to go to Penn State but at the last
minute decided on Pitt. ”I
recieved a late phone call in May
from [then Pitt] Coach [Fred]
Lewis offering me a scholarship,"
said Pfister. ’’I came here on a
recruiting trip and met a bunch of
the guys on the team and had a
pretty incredible time,” be con-
tinued.

Another factor in Pfister’s
choosing Pitt was the fact that his
sister Tracy was already attending
Pitt. She was a sophomore at the
time and also on the swim team.
"She was a pretty big motivation-
al force for me," said Pfister.

Pfister feels that one thing that
has made it easier to stay with the
sport for so long is the relation-
ship between the guys on the
team.

”Workouts are pretty laid back.
The guys on the team are pretty
hilarious. That, along with the
coaches, makes practice an ex-
perience," he said.

Even though Pfister is not offi-
cially a team captain, a lot of the
people on the team look up to
him. ”As a freshman, I think Jody
sets a great example to look up
to as a swimmer, and as a lead-
er. He's a talented individual,”
said teammate Steve (loth.

’’I look up to him because he's
a great motivator and tries to
make you realize your potential,"
added sophomore Brian Orledge.

After swimming is over, Pfister
plans to get in shape for triatha-
Ions in the summer.

”l owe most of what l have to-
day to swimming. It shaped me
as a person. Now that it's over,
I don't want to Just stop. You
can't Just do that. You have to re-
direct your goals,” said Pfister.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, February 25, T988

Big East basketball laying down

0 In the wake of the Pitt-
Georgetown fight this past Satur-
day, the Big East Commissioner's
Office has decided to take action
to prevent further violence on the
coun.

League Commissioner Dave
Gavitt and his board installed

les effective Wednesday that
would suspend for one game any
playerls) ejected for fighting.

Also, only head coaches may
leave the bench if a fight does
break out. Any player who rush-
es the floor will be hit with a one-
game suspension.

Does this mean that if a fight
breaks out between Villanova
and Pitt in the future, that Rollie
Massimino and Paul Evans can le-
gally go one-on-one at mid-court?

0 What else can Craig Hey-

.yvard possibly do to damage his

already tarnished reputation? The
former Pitt tailback was involved
in an accident this past Saturday
in which he wrecked a loaned
1980 9285 Porsche in Polish Hill.

The car, which Heyward
reportedly plans to purchase af-
ter it has been repaired, sustained
$5000 worth of damage. I can't
wait to see what ”|ronhead” does
once his first NFL check arrives
and he actually has money to
blow.

0 Although the Panther basket-
ball team still has a one-half game
first place lead over Syracuse,
Wednesday night's loss to Seton
Hall may have been more
devastating than people realize.

. Pitt has games remaining against

Connecticut, Boston College, Se-
ton Hall and Syracuse and must
win them all to guarantee them
regular season league title
outright.

Connecticut tested Pitt earlier
this season at Fitzgerald Field
House, losing 61-58.

The Panthers also had a tough
time with Dana Barros and the
Eagles, winning 73-67 at BC. Se-
ton Hall is on a roll, winning five
of its last six games, including the
89-72 whitewashing of Pitt.

And Syracuse defeated Pitt
84-75 just two weeks ago in the
confines of Pittsburgh's own Civ-
ic Arena. The Panthers must trav-
el to Syracuse to face the
Orangemen March 6.

Paul Evans’ Panthers have their
work cut out for them.

0 Well, it's nearly March, and
the Penguins are again on their
quest for an early off-season. Af-

weeks ago, the Pens are only a
few points out of last place. Not
even Mario Lemieux, the NHL’s
leading scorer and All-Star
defenseman Paul Coffey seem to
be able to mold the Penguins into
a contender.

0 With spring football just
around the corner, there are a few
questions that need to be
resolved. Who will fill the gap in
the backfield with ”lronhead”
gone to the NFL? Presumably Bri-
an Davis. Davis is back at Pitt,
and if his work in the classroom
this year is half as good as what
he showed he could do on the
field his freshman year, people

‘the law; adds rules for fighting

might be saying ”Craig who?” by
the end of the 1988 season.

Another question mark is at the
quarterback position. The first
choice seems to be Darnell Dick-
erson, the strong-armed freshman
from Detroit who started the final
four games of the season last year
in place of Sal Genilla.

But then there's Larry Wanke,
a redshirt freshman who stepped
in and threw three touchdowns
against Texas in the second half
of the 1987 Bluebonnet Bowl af-
ter Dickerson was injured.

Dickerson obviously has more
game experience than Wanke,
but Wanke may be the front-
runner in the fall. Rumor has it
that Dickerson may not even set
foot on the field this year because
of academic problems.

The rest of the team seems
sound, though. Pitt has one of the
top—10 recruiting classes in the
country for the second straight
year, including three Parade All-
Americans. Linebacker Curtis
Bray and offensive lineman Mike
LiVorio, both of Gateway High
School, wide receiver Baron Jack-
son from Baton Rouge, La. and
USA Today All-American Mike
Chalenski of Kenilworth, NJ. will
certainly complement an already
solid Panther squad.

to endure a loss yet, but in some
of his wins he gets frustrated. He
realizes the thing he has to do is
get back into that ring and come
out fighting the next time.”

Santoro started strong this sea-
son. He pinned three of his first
four opponents and his closest
match to date has been an 8-5 de-
cision over O’Day in the finals of
the Lock Haven Invitational.

’’I knew that he had a good
shot at [being undefeated] only
because of the year that he had
last year,” Stottlemyer said. "For
him to lose to a collegiate, some-
body would have to have a great
match and Pat wrestle poorly. He
has beaten 40 guys in a row [not
including last night's match
against West Virginia, results of
which were not known at press
time], that is some phenomenal
feat. He is a hell of a talent.”

Even with all of the success that
he has had, Santoro is still ner-
vous before every match.

”In the first period, I sometimes
feel out of sorts,” Santoro said. "It
usually takes me till the second
period before I can get going. I
can get so nervous that my legs
feel rubbery. Once I get going,
though, I feel all right.”

With one goal behind him, the
national championship still lies
ahead.

Out of the arena, Santoro is an
exercise science major and ad
mits that juggling wrestling and
schoolwork can be hard.

"Sometimes you can try to use
wrestling as an excuse,” Santoro
said. "This semester, I realized
that you have to put academics
first. Wrestling is definitely im-
portant.”

After all is said and done with
this season, Pat is considering the
Olympics.

’’I might try out this year just to
get the experience," Santoro said.
”I think that I will take it more
seriously for the ’92 games. I
have to worry about a national ti-
tle before I worry about an Olym-
pic title.”

Santoro is the first inductee into
the Pitt IOO—win club. In less than
three years, he has been able to
accomplish more than any other
Pitt wrestler. ,

”I still have a lot of work to
do," Santoro said. ”I have a lot
of things to correct in my style.”

For an athlete who still needs
to improve, Santoro hasn’t done
badly for himself.
