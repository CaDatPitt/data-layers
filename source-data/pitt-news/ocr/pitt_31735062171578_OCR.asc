 SG Suffers Impasse

by BOB BONN

What began as a short Student
Government meeting to approve
a new elections code and to allo-
cate funds to several student or-
ganizations last Thursday ended
four and one-half hours later with
only four senators present. with
angry outbursts from President
Lenny Klavonic and with the Allo-
cations Committee taking an un-
precedented stand against the
vote of the Senate.

The marathon dispute was
touched off by the old question of
funding for the Pitt News staff.

I ‘Senate buisness continued as
usual with the passage of a new
Election Code for the upcoming
election and with funding for sev-
eral student organizations until
the Pitt News question came up.

The Allocations Committee, a
powerful group whose approval is
required for any such appropria-
tions, recommended that Pitt
News members not be given any
monetary assistance.

When the Senate failed to ap-
prove this recommendation and
instructed the committee to fund
the paper for this term. the group
refused. Several hours of heated
debate followed.

Pitt News business manager
Bob Lederman pointed out that
the paper is presently about $7
thousand behind in national ad-
vertising fees not yet received
(due to advertising budget cut
backs by major corporations)
‘and is operating on a very tight
budget.

According to Lederman, the pa-
per will have to eliminate publi-
cations partially during the spring
and entirely during the summer
sessions if additional funding does
not come from Student Govern-
ment.

Klavonic explained the reason
for funding the Pitt News in the
past. First. it generates some $70
thousand worth of advertising.
money that would otherwise have
to come from Student Activity
fees.

Secondly. staff members spend
an average of 15 to 20 hours per
week working on the Pitt News,

4 taking away from their own study-

ing time. part-time jobs. and so
forth.

Finally,.Klavonic indicated,
there is the service nature of the
paper, since it prints activities
and announcements either for
free or at cost and reaches all of
the University.

The Allocations Committee
countered with its policy of not
giving money to organizations us-

ing it for assistance to individual _

members. Several recesses were
called in the course of the meet-
ing for the committees delibera-
tion. and each time it returned
with the same recommendations.

Fiscal Crisis Haunting
University Operations

by VIRGINIA JOYCE
Associate Editor

'(Editor’s Note: The following is
the second installment of a two
part series dealing with the finan-
cial situation ot the University.)

The possibility of another Uni-
versity financial crisis during
1971-72 "is more than just a
spector." specualted Vice Chan-
cellor of Finance Edison Mont-
gomery.

EDISON MONTGOMERY ‘

In the event that the newly

elected state legislature fails to 
fully subsidize the University by '

the beginning of February.
Montgomery's office. as authoriz-

Board of Trustees. will begin bor-

rowing from local banks to the 

tune of 24 million dollars.

That figure represents the bal- 3
ance of the University’s initial ‘

budget request for the current fis-
cal year. more than 43 million dol-
lars. Under the Shafer adminis-

tration. the state legislature had 
funded the University for Winter 
Term operations half of its 1969- '

70 appropriation. 37 million dol-

lars or approximately 45 per cent 5

of the total budget.
INTEREST RATES
Montgomery estimated that the
University would "theoretically“
be solvent until the end of the fis-

cal year on the borrowed funds. 5
although prime interest should 3

bring an added deficit of $750.000.
Montgomery was quick to dis-

(Continuedion Page 2)

 

      
 

Don Marbury asked. “Where is
the power here‘? Is it in the elect-
ed representatives of the students
or with the Allocations Commit-
tee?“ (The committee is not
elected by students but chooses its
own members each year.)

Klavonic replied that “it’s obvi-
ous what's happening here: the
power to control student activity
fees money isn’t with the elected
representatives but with the Allo-
cations Committee.”

Finally. the Senate voted to by-
pass the committee and fund the
Pitt News for January out of its
own budget. This amounted to
$1.833.

As the meeting adjourned short-
before midnight. Klavonic ex-
pressed his total disgust with
what had happened. "Students at
this University have little say
about their money." he said.

The lame duck president contin-
ued by saying. “I was extremely
angry at what the Allocations
Committee did and I‘m really
glad this is the last meeting. I
hope that the new constitution
will change what‘s going on. so
that what the students want gets
accomplished."

Elections for an all-new Stu-
dent Government under the new
constitution will take place on

Walkout Threat Eased

As Talks

by EVAN PATTAK
Feature Editor

The threat of a walkout by Uni-
versity custodians. groundskeep-
ers and elevator operators was
apparently eased over the week-
end when officials of the Univer-
sity and Local 29 of the Service
Employees International Union
agreed to reopen contract negotia-
tions.

The 432 Union members em-
ployed by the University. includ-
ing janitors and janitresses.
maids. elevator operators. paint-
ers. mechanics. gardeners. some
cooks. groundskeepers and store-
keeper-receivers had previously
rejected what was reportedly the
Universi_ty‘s final contract offer.

In rejecting the contract last
Thursday. however. the Union set
no definite strike date. Some Un-
ion members. advocating an im-
mediate strike. tried to shout
down their leaders. and in the en-
suing chaos. the meeting was ad-
journed before a decision could be
reached.

With a strike apparently immi-
nent, University officials had
planned to fill as many of the va-
cant positions as possible with
managerial and administrative
personnel, faculty, and resident

 

for

assistants. In addition to the obvi-
ous crippling effects of the strke,
University officials feared sym-
pathy strikes by other ' unions
having members employed by th
University. «

About 80 members of Local 29
failed to report for work Thurs-
day evening.

There was no appreciable ab-
senteeism Friday morning. al-
though 35 workers failed to re-
port Friday evening (eight is av-
verage). During the weekend,
bargaining agents for the Univer-
sity and the Union agreed to an-
other meeting. That meeting will
take place tomorrow at 3 p.m.

The three year contract offer
rejected by Local 29 called for
across-the-board salary increases
of $.35 hourly, retroactive to Jan-
uary 1, 1971 (the date of expira-
tion of the previous three year
contract); $.25 hourly, effective
January 1, 1971, and $.20 hourly,
effective January 1, 1973.

Improvements in the pension
plan. sickness benefits, and sick
leave were also proposed in the
contract offer. The University of-
fered to pay Blue Cross-Blue
Shield costs for all employees and
to implement a scheduled 20 min-
ute rest period daily for each em-
ployee.

Mid-March "Scam Date’

(Continued from Page 1)

Rtinguish between the financial

problems of 1971 and the crisis of
1970. While admitting that “un-
til Shapp and the legislature get
settled, we can’t do a darn thing,”
the University’s chief financial di-
rector is convinced that the in-
coming lawmakers are "more

V friendly and enlightened than in
‘ previous years."
I tant, however, to speculate wheth-

He was reluc-

er or not they would pass a state
income tax, purporting the goal of

, g_gGovernor-elect Milton Shapp.

He also suggested that the
“united front” relationship among
the presidents of Pitt, Temple and
Penn State will have a favorable
impact on the legislatures ulti-
mate decision.

"The alternatives to an inade-
‘quate state appropriation are al-
ways two in number,“ proposed
Montgomery, "We can either
raise tuition (which has been done

V at Temple University to the level

of $980 per annum) or cut back
services.”

TUITION HIKE OUT

"But no one wants to raise tui-
tion," he continued. “We would be
destroying the whole state pur-
pose of this institution and we‘d
begetting more like the Pitt of
old.” A hike would alter the Uni-
versity‘s character as a regional.
state institution with a local serv-
-ice philosophy. he felt.

The necessity for a long range
solution to the state‘s financial
woes could be solved if the legis-
lature initiated a policy of ap-

Q I s ._.proving the appropriations of uni-

versities and colleges a year in
advance. Montgomery pointed
out. But this measure would be
blocked, he added. by current
rules which prevent one legisla-
ture from committing a succeed-
ing one to budgetary allocations.

Montgomery put the “scare

date" deadline at the middle of

March, after which the University
will have to start. worrying about
its immediate fiscal solvency.

"There’s one other difference
between this year and last,“ he
said ruefully. "Last year, only
the institutions had to borrow
money to keep going. This year all
state agencies, including the wel-
fare office, hospitals and even the
public school systems are in the
same boat. And it’s possible that
the public schools will be given
priority.”

There will be a Ski Club
meeting Wednesday night in
the Student Union at 8 p.m.
for the New York ski trip. The
room will be announced.

of a similar study made five years
ago—asked experts in 36 fields to
evaluate those institutions giving
Ph.D.'s in their disciplines.

When asked what he felt were
Watkins major achievements in.

his year and a half as Pitt‘s ROTC '

commander, Dougherty stated

‘.

that he thought it was Watkins =,

"portrayal of the true military

stereotype of the military guy

of communication between us and
the University and the commun-
ity.“

Dougherty went on to note that
another indication of Watkins.’ Q
success is the fact that the nim-
ber of freshmen in the Air Force
ROTC has nearly tripled over last
year. He attributed this to the re-
cruiting of
through letters and meetings dur-

Concerning the Air Force ROTC

is that he was advanced over 85

obtained free the services of the
United States Navy for their mo-
vie Toral Tora! Tora! They in-
terviewed a fleet of admirals and
bureaucrats. none of whom were
really sure or could say with cer-
tainty. Twentieth Century. it ap-
peared. had persuaded the Navy
to provide "assistance." i. e.
ships and men. by arguing that a
"_ “g movie demonstrating the need
for military preparedness would
generate public support for bigger

naval appropriations.

CBS traced the channel of in-
fluence all the way up to former

light in pointing out. somehow
became head of the Motion Pic-
ture Producers Association when
Boss Lyndon returned to the

was pretty gross and Mike Wal-

not the American taxpayer. who

to the Fox Corp.. should not be ad-

devout American Legionnaire
must be a bit weary of fighting
WW II. There have been more
than 20 films annually since 1945
telling the tale of how we brave
American freedom lovers over-
came overwhelming odds to bash,
thrash, etc. After all of that, Fox,
those wonderful folks who brought
us D-Day, tells us of the Ameri-

Elect on Code Explained

by BILL KACZYNSKI

Student Government Election
Committee <GEC) Chairman
John Burby outlined rules con-
cerning Student Government (SG)
elections at meetings for prospec-
tive candidates last Thursday and
Friday.

The purpose of the three meet-
ings (the third is tomorrow) is to
familiarize the candidates with
the new election code and to offer
them an opportunity to experi-
ment with the codes viability.

According to the code. cam-
paigning is limited to personal
contact and posters. which are
subject to SGEC approval. This
excludes all kinds of buttons and
flyers. Also. to prevent the possi-
bility of candidate inexposure.
three debates will be scheduled.

Some candidates found these
provisions of the code unduly re-
strictive but most indicated a will-
ingness to comply with the elec-
tion rules. Several candidates ex-
pressed concern at the relative
ease with which any student can
bring about the expulsion of a can-
didate or in other ways hamper
the election process.

Though sympathizing with the
candidates. Burby said that the
goal of the new elections code is a
fair and uncontroversial proce-
dure and that its stringency was
necessary to center the election
around “the issues and not the
personalities."

 

SG CANDIDATES were briefed Thursday and Friday.

Another general objection to the
code was based on its proposed
method of voter registration.
Each student must present his
plastic ID plus either his pink
course record slip or academic in-
voice in order to vote. Many can-
didates feared that. since most
students do not carry both of these
identifications with them. voter
turnout would be inhibited.

Burby, unable to obtain a com-
plete roster of students from the
University, said that there were
no other options. Suggestions
ranging from stamping voters on
their arms with black light ink to

punching the plastic ID cards
were discarded as unfeasible.

That fact that no black stu-.
dents were appointed to the
SGEC was disputed by a black
candidate. Burby stated that he
would be unable to alter the situa-
tion without postponing the elec-
tion.

Attendance at one of the three
elections procedures meetings is

a prerequisite to placement on ‘

the election slate. The final meet-
ing will take place tomorrow at 6
p.m. in Room 119. SU. The elec-
tion is scheduled for Jan. 20.

lished in Friday's edition of the
Pitt News was an advertise-
ment paid for by Student Gov-
ernment and was not the work

(Editor's Note: The following
article is a personal reaction of
the author alter learning of the
University's campus radio sta-
tion, WPGH’s efforts to gain
money for 'the Pittsburgh Free
Clinic. The Clinic was estab-
lished last August, and has since
handled nearly 1,600 patients.
Located at South Highland and
Alder Streets, East Liberty, the

1 clinic has a stall at 56 Doctors

and 40 nurses most of whom
are volunteers, with very few
being paid. The clinic operates
primarily on donations from
patients, and a donation re-
ceived from the Folk Medical
Foundation. Miss Larkin leels
that WPGH deserves commen-
dation for this truly humani-
tarian lund drive, and officers
of the radio station report that
the can, used to collect the con-
tributions, is nearly hall full.
The stall of the Pitt News
urges all students and mem-
bers ol the campus community
to take a trip down to Winkey’s
and drop something into the
Pittsburgh Free Clinic Can. The
drive will continue to this Wed-
nesday. Right On, WPGH.)

Perhaps, as you casually
strolled down Forbes this past
weekend, Jan. 8-9, you noticed
a strange looking can sitting out-
side Winky’s.

Did you brothers and sisters
stop to talk, shop or even drop
a coin for the cause. Pittsburgh

say: “Sorry,” And for all those
who did show concern or even
curiosity by stopping and at
least giving of themselves,
thank you!

very likely to come about. Again.
the Congressmen who are plan-
ning this move have agreed
to use the same sure-fire argu-

ment. Namely, the unhealthy
effect on the nation's young.

The House Bill, it passed,
will not allow a picture of
Richard M. Nixon to be trans-
mitted longer than 15 seconds
without the following explicit
warning. “Caution: the follow-
ing may be harmful to the
health; Draft eligible citi-
zens will not be exempted from
military service because of
illness arising from over-expos-
ure to President Nixon’s like-
ness. The Surgeon-General of
the Unites States of America’.

A reputable government
source in Washington has said
that if the measure was brought
to a vote today. it would surely
fail. If. however. certain classi-
fied information was made
public, there would be consider-
able popular support for the
House measure.

One of the most disquieting
trends of our time is the in-
creasing emphasis placed on
group thinking or what I call
the “group mentality." This
doctrine involves the attempt
of a small set of individuals
within a particular societal
sub-group to portray their per-
ception of ideas and events as
representative of the sub-group
asawhole.

I can think of no tenet po-
tentially more destructive to
our free society as we now
know it than this.

Two recent examples of this
phenomenon are the recent de-
mands raised by the Black
Action Society and Women's
Liberation. To recount the par-
ticulars of each case is beyond
my present purpose. I think
Mr. Conley has done a fine
job of exposing the flaws in
the BAS case. Furthermore I
am willing to concede the
possibility that irregularities
do exist, though not of the
type that the parties in ques-
tion subscribe to.

Rather. what I find extremely
interesting in each case is the
belief on the part of a few that
their proclivities are synono-
mous with those of the group
at large. Hence the demands of
some blacks for more blacks in
decision making positions and
ditto some women for women’s
lib.

But surely this is not the
case. The intellectual system-

 

The American Medical Asso-
ciation (previously known as
an administration supporter)
has asked-in the case that the
bill is defeated- that a less
strenuous measure, limiting
transmission of the President's
face to other than hospitals.
homes of cardiac patients. and
doctors who simply would not
care to watch, be proposed.

The lobbies of the Television
industry are sure to balk at the
new measure. In the case of
wiping Nixon‘s face off the
screen. they will probably re-
ply that this law is just another
under—handed attempt by Con-
gress to limit constitutional free-
doms.

We must clearly see. however.
that a person's first right is his
freedom to live a healthy life.
Nixon‘s face has never helped
anything. Besides. this measure
happens to be in line with the
last administrations policy to
‘Keep America Beautiful’.

ization of the “group mental-
ity" theory is synthetic. artifi-
cial. and arbitrary.

What reason have we to sup-
pose that all blacks or women
have the same ideas or adhere
to the same beliefs3/s Why can-
not a white hold the same con-
fictions as a black and there-
fore represent him adequate|y3/s

And if these statements are
correct, isn‘t it possible that
interests could be represented
even if one of the groups own
is not the decision—maker.

To hire and fire on the basis
of “quotas” or “balance” would
reduce administrations or gov-
ernments to a crazy quilt patch-
work of individuals, ostensibly
picked to represent “groups”
which in reality either have
little social cohesion or are
nonexistent.

What I am arguing. then. is
that just because Group A does
not have x number of adminis-
trators representing them does
not automatically bespeak dis-
crimination precisely because
Group A may not in fact exist.

The tragic result of this
“group mentality“ has been the
change taking place in some
quarters regarding the hier-
archy of society. Contrary to
egalitarianism. every society
needs a hierarchy in order to
function. The question is: How
is this hierarchy to be chosen-‘is

The answer for many centur-
ies was simple: Birthright.
Those fortunate enough to be
born into the upper class
prospered. but the lower classes
were on a treadmill to oblivion.
They had very little chance
for advancement.

Then came the commerce
revolution. A new class of mer-
chants and traders sprang up.
Gradually. through the pres-
sure of the middle class. con-
stitutional republics were es-
tablished.

Individuals acquired the
right to pursue their own ends
uninhibited. The standards of

One of America's

 

living rose faster than any-
time in history.

But more important, people
from humble origins rose to
important places in society on
the basis, not of birthright,
but on Ability. Whoever got
the job done best received his
just due.

Unfortunately. we are now‘
witnessing a reversal of this
trend. In some cases. ability is
not the discriminating criteria.
but rather positions are given
out on the basis of "quotas.“

Blacks are demanding posi-
tion because they are black and
women see feminity as the
ultimate yardstick. A continua-
tion of this course can lead at
best to mediocrity and possibly
to disaster.

To those who argue that dis-
crimination has put them in
their present dilemma, I can
only reply that the proper
remedy is to work for the elim-

ination of any scheme whic,/~

causes race or color to be the
determining factor in employ-
ment. Certainly the implemen-
tation of another scheme which
is also discriminatory can only
compound the problem.

Finally, it should always be
remembered that the ultimate
and only source of permanent
advancement is self-improve-
ment.

People don’t flock to see and
hear James Brown or Claire
Booth Luce because they are
black or female. Rather. they
recognize that each excells in
his or her chosen field. To call
this “tokenism" is to belittle
the many excellent deeds that
each has accomplished through
many years of hard work.

Although writing almost
fifty years ago, the late Pro-
fessor Oswald Spengler gave

some advice worth remember-._ 

ing today:

Fear abolishes individuality and crowds
the “I’s” together. But the superior man
whose bloodline is strong wants to be “I”
not “we.”

Two opinions on the POW’s

Popular Skepticism about POW Raid Draining Viet War Support

llationalizations Fail
in Vail Imperialism

by BOB GING
News Editor

Since the beginning of anti-war
demonstrations during the Presi-
dency of LBJ. the first executive
has always countered the voices of
dissent with rationalizations for
our. involvement in Southeast
Asia. Although the credibility of
government excuses for contin-
ued participation in Vietnam has
always been slight, it did reach
the people and

say. “Yes. we
are there. and
this is why! "

Recently. our
President has
become aware
that forthright.
if not honest. ra-
tionalization of
the war. sick of
promises never kept. and increas-
ingly sick of the man who is the
main advocate of that war.

GING

Our government, and more spe-
cifically our President, tried to
muffle the noise of just protest
through every means at it’s dipos-
al. The rhetoric of Mitchell and
Agnew failed to stop anti-war sen-
timent, and conspiracy charges
have only served as further jus-
tification for the movement. rath-
er than as the weapons of fear
which they were intended to be.
Withdrawal of troops from Viet-
nam proved ineffective in calm-
ing an every more vocal nation.

Faced with the declining popu-
larity of the war. and finding him-
self increasingly unpopular. Pres-
ident Nixon decided to hit the na-
tional conscience where it would
be most certain to respond. This
time he decided to use the plight
of the 339 U.S. servicemen held
as POW‘s by the North Vietna-
mese as an issue to rally our na-
tion to his side.

I urge the reader not to con-
clude that I am condemning the
POW‘s. or that I am unsympathe-
tic to their situation. but rather
that I am attempting to analyze
the way that our government is
using their distress as a cheap po-
litical publicity trick.

Nixon and company obviously
became aware that token with-
drawals and an indefinite end no-
where in sight were failing to win
the American people to his side.
It is a shame that he had to use
the plight of these men, who al-
though their views may differ

from ours, are no less staunch in
their belief that they are doing
right.

Nixon‘s concern for the POW‘s
seems questionalble. when one
looks at the methods he has used
to attain their succor. His John
Wayne invasion proved an undeni-
able failure. Negotiations. with
unreasonable demands. will never
release these men. A rational sol-
ution, and one that has been sug-
gested for many years is cessa-
tion of all hostilities in Southeast
Asia. Knowing that the Nixon ad-
ministration is adverse to ration-
ality. one may also suggest that
the war-prone leaders of this na-
tion lessen the demands for_a per-
manent cease-fire, and let their
concern for our captured service-
men override their imperialist
goals.

It has become difficult for faith
in our government to be further
shaken. Last-ditch sensationalist
propaganda plays. such as those
our government is currently em-
ploying, are widening the breach
between the people and the state.

Withdrawal Solution to crisis

by PAUL Le BLANC
Staff Columnist

The last several months of 1970 saw the growth
of genuine public concern over U.S. prisoners of
war. This concern was in large measure generated
and mobilized by a well-heeled. government-backed
publicity drive which hinted that American POWs
in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are being
mistreated.

Patriotic hostility toward that weak and distant
country had never been especially intense, and the
continual drain of American lives and resources
into the civil war in Southern Vietnam has been ac-
companied by a progressive decline in American
pro-war sentiment.

In the wake of popular response to this publicity
drive came the following: 1) a small—scale renewal
of U.S. bombing in North Vietnam after the downing
of a reconnaissance plane; 2) a much-publicized
military raid into North Vietnam to “free POWs”;
3) statements from U.S. government officials to
the effect that the U.S. presence in Vietnam will last
as long as U.S. POWs are there (setting up a nice vi-
cious circle); 4) renewed assertions that if the
North Vietnames “interfere with” the “Vietnami-
zation” program, the United States would retaliate
—-apparently by pouring more troops into Vietnam,

In most wars prisoners are taken; the treat-
ment of such prisoners is never the highest prior-

ity of either side, and abuses are bound to occur.
The kind of war being waged in Vietnam—where the
"enemy" is indistinguishable from the people—is
especially brutal. Granting the probability of the
mistreatment of some U.S. POWs in such a context.
the question arises: How does the other side (i.e..
our side) treat POWs?

The well-documented answer is gently suggested
by the respected French journal Le Monde (Nov.
29, 1970):

“The behavior of the Americans and the South Vietnames as far
as detainees is concerned—whether they are considered as POWs
or not—is far from irreproachable. Suffice to quote the difficulties
placed in the way of the inquiry commissions of the Red Cross
when they visited the Pulo Condor prison camp in January, 1970.
The delegates were not permitted to visit the whole camp and could
see only 20 of the 9,000 prisoners. It was in Pulo Condor that the
‘tiger cages’ were discovered. In December, 1969, at Bien Iloa
camp near Saigon. there were found to be 1,500 children from 12
to 17 years old. Finally one remembers the photo of the ‘Viet Cong’

prisoner being thrown alive from a helicopter in flight. He was

‘only’ a Vietnames.”

Within Nixon’s velvet glove of “Vietnamiza-I

tion” ,we can perceive an iron fist—the intention to
“win. It would seem that U.S. POWs are pawns in
the game.

A rational alternative to such a game would be
the withdrawal of all U.S. troops, permitting the
Vietnamese to settle their own differences and re-
unify their country according to the principles of
the 1954 Geneva Agreements. This would result in
the release of all POWs and would save the lives of
many Americans and Vietnamese.

Morris’ Status Unsure

by MARTY HELLMAN

Cold shooting by the Panther
basketball team in the second half
of Saturday night's game at
Syracuse enabled
men to overcome a one-point
halftime deficit and to hold on
for a 78-69 victory.

The loss was the third of the
season on the road for Coach Buzz
Ridls squad and evened the over-
all record at 5-5.

Although the Cats had 215 more
field goal attempts in the contest.
they were unable to take advan-
tage of it and only shot 37 per-
cent from the field.

“That’s where our problem
was,” explained Ridl after the
game. “We were getting the
good shots, but they just weren’t
going in for us. There were at
least five more field goals that
we should have made."

Along with the Panthers poor
shooting. the Orangemens un-
usual accuracy at the foul line
was a decisive factor in the
game. Syracuse shot 32-39 from
the charity stripe. well above
its seasons average of 64 percent.

Greg Kohls. top point produc-
er in the game with 24 points.
canned 16 free throws. many of
them coming in crucial one-and-
one situations.

In the final twelve minutes,
the free throw was the main of-

the Orange- _

fensive weapon for the Orange-
men, as they sank only four bas-
kets and 18 foul shots in that
stretch.

The Panthers paralleled the
Orangemens sharpshooting from
the foul line as they hit on 21
of 23 attempts.

For the third game in a row.
Paul O‘Gorek led the Panthers
in scoring with 21 points and was
top rebounder.

“Paul had another real good
game,” Ridl commented. “He
has been one of the most con-
sistent players for us recently.”

For the second game in a row.
forward Carl Morris was sidelin-
ed due to a knee injury. and
Ridl now thinks that it may keep
him out of the lineup for the dur-
ation of the season.

"We certainly missed Morris
at Syracuse." Said Ridl. "It would
have been nice to have his ex-
perience and shooting then. Un-
fortunately. Carl may have to
miss the rest of the games be-
cause of his knee. but were not
sure now.“

In order to catch up in the
second half, Ridl employed a
new offense with only one big
man, O’Gorek, and four guards
against the short Syracuse team.

"We wanted a quicker team
on the court in order to get the
ball. but they (Syracuse) were

able to control the ball

well. ” Ridl stated.

probably be playing more in

he’ll give us a little more shoot-

Injury Limits Effectiveness

“Racism” Column Corrected

By ED CONLEY
Sports Editor

(Editors Note: Misplaced para-
graphs distorted Friday’s column
“More Proof Is Needed.” The
column is printed here in its
correct form.)

It is impossible to say that
the Pitt Athletic Department is
completely free of racism. I be-
lieve. because there are simply
too many people involved in the
operation. But the accusations
leveled by the Black Action So-
ciety (BAS> last month say that
there is a great amount of racism.
that the Athletic Department
maintains “racist policies". This
still has to be proven.

Gamaliel Ballard. chairman of

.the BAS. is convinced that he has

presented enough proof after re-
searching the situation once Black
athletes. predominantly football
players. asked him for assis-
tance. He hasn’t convinced me.

—BAS says the Black athlete is
being exploited in the specific
areas of recruitment.

I don't think so. The Athletic
Department lists 434 athletes;

44-are Black. Two hundred—thir-

ty-seven (237) athletic scholar-
ships are awarded: 24 of them be-
long to Blacks. Fifteen other
Black athletes are awarded some
other type of financial aid.

These figures dont seem to in-
dicate racist policy in recruit-
ment. but more important than
the numbers is the fact that the
recruiting of Blacks has improv-
ed greatly in Athletic Director
Casmir Myslinskis two years at
Pitt — with every indication that
the situation will continue to im-
prove.

Ballard says the numbers of
Blacks are greater than in the
past. but he claims the racism
is as prevalent as ever. All I ask
‘whereisit‘.’”

—BAS says the Black athlete
is being exploited in the specific
area of development through
equal opportunity to compete.

I don't think so. Certainly the
majority of the 44 Black athletes
have been very important to the
success of Pitts athletic squads.
The particular objections in op-
portunity to play appear to in-
volve head football coach Carl
DePasqua. BAS seems to be cit-

ing; the _lask._of . one Black foot-

ball players playing time. while
forgetting about seven Blacks who
gained starting positions under
DePasqua.

It‘s also argued that DePas-
qua -didn't put forth enough ef-
fort to gain post-season game
berths for his Black seniors. and
that he didn‘t name tackle Lloyd
Weston captain because Weston
is Black.

DePasqua says he recommend-
ed all of his senior starters for
All—Star games. and there is no
sensible reason to disbelieve him.
A couple of Pitt's Black stars
should have been selected. All
of the holiday game committees
should be blasted for these over-
sights.

As far as selecting a team cap-
tain. Carl DePasqua didn‘t choose
one last year either. The Pitt
coach prefers to name game cap-
ing the lack—of one Black foot-
tain. and some Blacks were in-
cluded in the long list of game
captains this year.

Before mentioning the BAS‘
final area of alleged racism. I
think it is necessary to say that
the Black organization. should

. -lems will get solved that way. ~ -

   

never have called defensive
back Charlie Hall a "white
quitter.“ His name wasn‘t men-
tioned. but his identity was made
very clear. and the remark was
the kind that only creates antag-
onism. .

—BAS says the Black athlete
is being exploited in the specific
area of publicity.

Again. I don‘t think so. But
my opinion here doesn't matter.
Members of the press choose
their topics for stories. not the
Pitt publicity department. Its
main task. I believe. is to keep
the press aware of the general
development in the Athletic De-
partment.

Racist policies in the Pitt Ath-
letic Department‘? No. I don‘t
think so. Ballard and the BAS
have not been able to prove it
to me. I don’t say that it can‘t
be proven though. If anyone
thinks they can convince me that
the BAS charges are valid. they
are welcomed to come to the
Pitt News Sports office to dis-
cuss the matter. I'd prefer that
they go to the Athletic Directors
office. though. Maybe the prob-

 

Bucknell /Freestylers

°Baptize’ Pitt Mermen

Wessel Tops
All Diving

Competitors

by JAN FRY

The Pitt swimmers were "Bap-
tized" by Bucknell with a 37-76
loss at Trees on Saturday.

"Everyone has to get baptized

sometime.“ remarked Pitt Coach
Bill Grant. “They (Bucknell)
could put in three potential

swimmers for every one of ours.
We knew we had to get them
early in the meet so our best
swimmers went in as early as
possible.“

Bucknell. a strong freestyle
team. lost their top swimmer
whom the coach had kicked off the
team for poor attitude. However.
the Bucknellians still managed
to take eight of the 13 events
and three of the five freestyle
events.

Pitts Dave Wessel took the 1-
and 3- meter events. scoring 248.
3 and 250.6 respectively.

"I'm really pleased with Dave."
commented Grant. "He could be
Eastern Champion. The more he
dives the better he gets. He’ll
progress as the season does."

Grant was also pleased with
the diving of freshman Martin
Staley. who placed third with
a score of 177.1 in the 3—meter
and scored 180.35 in the‘ 1-meter.

"He did a lot better than I
thought he would for his first
meet since high school." praised
Grant. “He did the best he‘s ever
done in the 3-meter todav.".

Pitt's Fred Lewis had a "good
effort“ as Grant put it in the
1.000 freestyle with a winning
timeof11:18.4.

Dave Anderson. with a time of
2:19.4. took the 200-butterfly
and Rick Rowe missed tying
his pool record by .4 seconds in
the 500-freestyle. "He did really
well.“ Grant stated in regard to
Rowe‘s taking first in the 500-
freestyle event.

In the 400 Medley the coach
was impressed with the swim-
ming of Mark Cohen. Cohen
broke his own record in the re-
lays. "Everyone really swam
their hearts out today." Cohen
remarked.

The match was the Pitt swim-
mer's first meet of the season
and Bucknells win was the third.
The mermen will have some time
before the next meet on Janu-
ary 20th against West Virginia.

 

  

Fred Lewis, Winning I000 Freestyle

JV Wrestlers Triumph;
Cox, Brightbill Pin Foes

Dropping only two bouts. with
one of them being a forfeit at
134 lbs.. the JV grapplers rolled
over Stevens Trade School. 25-
14. at the Field House Satur-
day.

The ability of John Buzzatto
and Jim Tate to ride out their
opponents for an entire period
with cross-body enabled these
two Pitt grapplers to earn a
victory and a draw. at 142 and
150. respectively.

Falls were recorded by Al
Cox and Fred Brightbill. Cox,
leading 10-4 at the time, decked
his 118 pound opponent at 5:56.
Brightbill, possibly the finest
prospect on the JV squad, put
away his man at 2:54 in the 167
pound division.

Don Ross and Wally Morrell
carved out workmenlike decisions
in winning at 158 and 177. re-
spectively. Only Dave Carroll
lost. 7-2. at 126 to Stevens" best

Saturday the Pitt gymnastics
team did something no one on
the team can remember happen-
ing before: they defeated Slip-
pery Rock rather convincingly.
126.60 - 120.25. They were also
the only Pitt team to win this
weekend.

Pitt won four events in the
overall scoring and four events
were won by individuals on the
Pitt team.

Lowell Meek won the first

. event. the free exercixe. with a

score of 8.65. Pitt Coach Warren
Neiger commented that the judg-
ing was rather harsh in that the
scores were consistently below
the individuals‘ average perfor-
mance.

Dick Pribis scored 7.45, good
enough for third place behind
Steve Heasley’s score of 7.8
which garnered second place for
SR. Dave Andrew’s 7.2 helped
the team score in the event for a
Pitt total of 23.30 to SR’s 20.5.

Phil Lilly's 8.1 score on the
side horse was most pleasant in
Neiger’s opinion. in that he is
recovering from shoulder injury
and was not able to compete at
Army in December. His score
was good enough for second

It gives you a smoother ride and a shorter turn- "

It even has a longer lasting, more powerful en-

All told, this car has 89 things you've never

seen inside the Beetle.

ln fact, it's so superior to the Beetle, we couldn't
call it the Beetle anymore.

So we gave this car, whose mild-mannered ex-

We call it SUPER BEETLE. ‘
