Pitt band members not happy with director

By John B. Moore
Asst. News Editor

Just weeks after an in—house investigation
cleared University Bands Director O’Neill
Sanford of charges brought against him by
various band alumni members, current and
former band members still express doubt
that changes will be made in the department.

During an internal audit conducted from
May to July, the university looked into sev-
eral charges against Sanford, the most severe
having to do with the misuse of university

. funds.

Among the charges were accusations that
Sanford would take volunteers out to meals,
then charge the university. ,

According to a Sept. 1 University Times
article, Pitt Athletic Director Oval Jaynes
said, “Did O’Neill Sanford take some volun-
teers out for meals? Yes. But there was no
evidence whatsoever that he approached the
university to be reimbursed. No travel forms,
no receipts, nothing. Based on all the evi-
dence, he paid for those meals out of his
own pocket.”

Sanford was unavailable for comment.

Former band member Dakon Brodmerkel
was responsible for circulating a survey to
band members seeking an overall consensus
on how people felt about the direction of the
band and where it was heading. The survey
was then sent out to band alumni, the athletic

department and Chancellor J. Dennis

O’Connor.

Brodmerkel said he disagreed with the
results of the audit. “We were wondering, if
there" was nothing wrong, why are there
changes being made?”

Brodmerkel said he was referring to the
athletic department’s business staff taking
over some of the administrative duties for-
merly assumed by Sanford and his assistant
director.

“The results [of the audit] were good for
every staff member but O’Neill,” said
Brodmerkel. About 50 percent of the stu-
dents surveyed had some problem with
Sanford, Brodmerkel added.

Dorsett spoke candidly about coming home to Aliquippa and

Dorsett: Busy, man. I am busy, it is like non-stop. I’ve
become hot again, but it’s good. To be joining that elite fraternity
and being a part of the history and the tradition of the National

By Kathleen Scanlon
Staff Writer

Before embarking on her
freshman year at Pitt, Barb
Cameron was worried about
making friends.

Pitt student mentors calmed
her fears.

“They were fun people,” she
said. “They made. you see the
fun side of Pitt, not just the aca-
demic.”

Later, Cameron became a stu-
dent mentor.

Student mentors participate in
a freshman orientation just
before the fall tenn, as well as in
six advising sessions for incom-
ing freshmen throughout the
summer.

Throughout the school year,
members of the central staff in
the Office of New Student
Programs, many of whom are
veteran mentors, plan and coor-
dinate these new student activi-
ties, said Eric “Buck” Scerbo, a
central staff member.

During the summer advising

sessions, freshmen are divided
up into groups. The student
mentors meet with their group,
each made up of about 20 to 30
freshmen, three times during the
three-day session. They discuss
class scheduling, arrange for
freshmen to take placement tests
and help them to register for
classes, Scerbo said.

“The mentors show them dif-
ferent parts of the university that
will give them a stronger basis
of the university,” said Matthew
Sataloff, also a member of cen-
tral staff. “We show them where
clubs are, what the William Pitt
Union is, whatoffices are in the
WPU we show them

‘Thackeray Hall  and the com-

puter labs.

“We also basically answer all
the questions: ‘what's the food
like?,’ ‘what are the best teach-
ers to take?’, ‘how am I going to
make friends?”

As an incoming freshman,
Sataloff did not worry about
making friends. He expected to

_vform friendships quickly, but he

felt pressured because he also
expected to do very well acade-
mically.

“I knew how to do well, and
if I didn’t, I was going to be in
trouble.”

Sataloff said his mentors
helped him to relax and to ﬁnd a
balance. When Sataloff sched-
uled classes, the mentors told
him'not to overload himself, but
not to go too light. They also
told him to have fun with
extracurricular activities.

“The mentor, almost like a big
brother, was there to calm me
down and show me the light, to
show me the right direction.”

This inspired Sataloff to apply
to become a mentor. He said he
hopes his participation in the
mentor program will motivate
others to apply.

“Hopefully they’ll be so over-
whelmed and grateful that I did
this for them that they’ll become

mentors in a couple years, and

the cycle will keep on going,”
he said.
When Chrissy Butczynski

The Pitt News, Tuesday, September 6, 1994

stepped on Pitt turf for the first
time, she feared getting lost in
the crowd.

Her mentors told her to get
involved, to ﬁnd her niche.

Butczynski followed their
advice and became a student
mentor. “As a mentor, I feel like
I’m not just a number,” she said.
“I’m actually someone who, if
an administrator sees me, they’ll
say ‘hi’. I feel a little more a
part of the university.”

Butczynski’s participation in
the mentor program helped to
proliferate the mentor cycle.
One freshman who was in
Butczynski’s mentor group dur-

ing a summer advising session, '

applied to become a mentor that
year and wrote about
Butczynski in the application
essay.

The student wrote about her
appreciation that Butczynski did
not forget her after the advising
session, but would stop and talk
to her throughout the year.

Butczynski said she appreciat-
ed the same qualities in her

Pitt student mentors celebrate twentieth anniversary

mentors.

“I remembered my mentors.
and I really liked what they had
done for me,” she said. “It
seems like it’s kind of a cycle
that goes on and on.”

Pitt students have fueled this
cycle, via the student mentor
program, for 20 years.

Throughout its 20-year histo-
ry, the student mentor program
has “recruited the very best stu-
dents  [who have done] mar-
velous things to orient new stu-
dents  and to make them com-
fortable,” said Dennis Donharn,
assistant vice-chancellor for stu-
dent affairs.

In the early 1980s, student
mentors were used primarily to
welcome incoming freshmen
when they arrived in the fall,
according to Donharn. But later
the program grew to encompass
the summer advising sessions,
he said. _

Brenda Pardini has served as
coordinator in the Office of
New Student Programs since
1988. She said she has enjoyed
watching the developmental
process of the students who get
involved with the student men-
tor program. The mentors grow
as they get involved with the
development of the freshmen,
she said.

When the summer. advising
sessions and orientation are

‘ over, many mentors volunteer to

help central staff recruit new
mentors, Scerbo said.

The recruitment process
begins in October with an Open
House, then continues with a
group interview. Central staff
and veteran mentors oversee
this interview and evaluate how
the candidates interact with a
group while completing a pro‘-
ject.

Scerbo said the mentors who
oversee the interviews look for
someone who is outgoing, able
to lead a discussion, open-mind-
ed and able to interact with any-
one.

“And we’re lookingfor some-
body who wants to have some
fun  We want to make this an
enjoyable experience for the
freshman coming in.”

Dorsett

°From page 1

‘‘It’s a particularly special night for
an unusually special young man,”
Majors said. ‘‘I couldn’t think of a
more exciting way to start our season
than to honor Tony Dorsett — the
greatest football player in any position
I’ve ever seen, much less coached.”

In light of Dorsett’s impressive sta-
tistics and accolades, Major’s state-
ments seem more than accurate.

As a Collegian, Dorsett accumulated
6,082 career rushing yards (an NCAA
record), was .a four-time All-
American, a Heisman trophy winner
in 1976 and helped lead the Panthers
to a national championship in the the
same year. ,

When the Dallas Cowboys drafted
Dorsett in the first round in 1977, they
chose a running back whose proven
collegiate skill continued with similar
professional success. Dorsett was the
NFL’s rookie of the year in 1977,
rushed for 12,739 career yards (rank-

ing him 3rd in NFL‘ history), led the

Cowboys to a victory in Super XII and
still holds the record for the longest
run in NFL history (99 and 1/2 yards.)

Majors summed up Dorsett’s career
more succinctly. ’

“[He is] the only player in the histo-
ry of the game — counting Jim
Thorpe, Alonzo Stagg, Jimmy Brown,
all the great ones — to have won the
Heisman, played on the national
championship college team, profes-
sional world’s championship team,
and to be inducted into both the col-
lege hall of fame and pro,” Majors
said.

Friday night marked the beginning’

of a big weekend in Pittsburgh,
according to Pitt Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor.

“What tonight represents is probably
the bestmaterial way of saying, ‘Tony
welcome back. We’re glad your
here,”’ O’Connor said.

Mark Torquato, a running back on
Pitt’s 1976 national championship
team and Dorsett’s former lockermate,
said Dorsett has always been apprecia-
tive of his friends and associates.

“I think [Dorsett] is one of the
nicest, gracious guys for what he’s
done in this world for people,”
Torquato said.

The evening culminated with the
presentation of. Dorsett’s highlight
film, which wowed the audience with
Dorsett’s trademark slash and cut runs

past stumbling defenders.

After viewing the movie, Pitt alum-
nus and medical school faculty mem-
ber Jean Yevik said the ceremony was

“very appropriate. Every game [he]
exploded.”

collegians and bring some
respect back to the University
of Pittsburgh.

TPN: Why has Pitt’s foot-
ball performance been sub-par
in recent years?

Dorsett: From my vantage
point you are seeing the Penn
States, Ohio States, the
Michigans [and] they are all
getting very quality athletes
and students. I don’t under-
stand why Pitt hasn’t been
able to do that  you got a lot
of people right here in Western
Pa. that shouldn’t be getting
out of this area.

TPN: What steps should Pitt
take to improve its football
program?

Dorsett: You’re moving in
the right direction now. You ,
got“a coach who is a very
well-respected coach in the
collegiate ranks  I am glad to
see Johnny’s back, and hope-
fully he can get the university
to bring the program, as far as
the facilities, up to the level of
the other top facilities in the
country. I mean they got the
same weight room that they
had up there when I was here.

TPN: Drawing on your own
college experiences, what
advice could you pass along to
new and old Pitt students?

Dorsett: For one, you got to
find yourself. Give yourself
a chance to adjust. You know,
I had a problem as a freshman.
Matter of fact, I almost
dropped out of school because
I really was not giving myself
a chance to adjust. I had
a problem making friends, just
the whole transition, the whole
adjustment [was big] —— and

I only lived thirty-minutes
away. You just got to be your-
self, relax, do what you
are supposed to do here —
that is, of course, try early to
establish good study habits 
and everything will fall into
place.

Too many people

In Cairo yesterday, the third United Nations world population
conference began. Even though population growth is one of the
world’s deadliest problems, this.is the only major international
attempt at defusing the population bomb.

Thecurrent world population is 5.6 billion and growing by
more than 90 million per year, with 90.percent of the growth
located in Third World nations. If population growth remains
unchecked, the’United Nations Population Fund estimates
world population will reach 8.5 billion in 2025, with no end in

‘ sight. The goal of the Cairo conference is to stabilize world

population at 7.27 billion by 2050, a daunting task.

The problems caused by population pressure include famine,
disease and environmental destruction. But the pernicious
problem of population growth is long-term. Many experts feel
we have already exceeded or are dangerously close to exceed-
ing the carrying capacity of the Earth. However, this is not a
magical barrier at which the population will cease to grow.
Rather, it is possible for us to continue to grow far beyond the
Earth’s carrying capacity, further depleting resources along the
way--analogous to deficit spending. Eventually nature will
bring us back to reality, and in all likelihood rather sharply. A
probable scenario would begin with massive famine and starva-
tion in the Third World, resulting in a chain reaction of destabi-
lization and destruction.

The choice is simple: either we can control population
growth in a humanitarian fashion by lowering birth rates, or we
can wait for nature to deal us a massive death check.

The once-a-decade U.N. population conferences attempt to
accomplish the former with a holistic approach. The general
goal is to attempt to decrease poverty; increase consumption,
access to birth control, family planning and education; and ele-
vate the role of women. ,

However, not everyone agrees. Many fundamentalist Islamic
countries are denouncing the conference as a conspiracy
against Islam and threaten to disrupt it with violence.

A stronger threat comes from the Vatican. The Pope’s con-
demnations of the conference as promoting abortion, sexual
promiscuity and homosexuality threaten to disrupt the confer-
ence and prevent even modest accomplishments. The last two
conferences were general failures because of political grand-
standing, primarily by the Reagan administration in concert
with the Vatican at the 1984 Mexico City conference.

It is time for the Pope to step off of his moral high horse and
recognize reality. The moral imperialism of the Church has
already caused centuries of wars and numerous atrocities. Now
there is a window of opportunity for dealing with the popula-
tion problem. If this conference fails, it will likely be another
decade before there is a another major international attempt to
halt population growth. By then, nearly a billion more people
will have been added to the planet as well as another decade of
population momentum. The fate of the world may very well be
in the hands of the Cairo conference participants.

eight predecessors have fol-

power and he will remain so
until he either dies or volun-
tarily steps down. The United
States continues to follow this
policy of trade and economic
embargo despite ample evi-
dence which clearly shows
that embargos only hurt the
people that they are meant to
help while doing little or no
damage to the dictator him-
self. (Iraqi leader Saddam
Hussein is a perfect example.)
I’ve heard some talking heads
make the claim that interna-
tional pressure forced the

that we should handle Cuba
the same way in which we are
currently engaging China —
through an economic open

' door policy that will first

improve the standard of liv-
ing of the average Cuban citi-
zen and, secondly, eventually
bring more political and per-
sonal freedoms to the Cubans.
This is clearly the affect that
economic diplomacy is hav-
ing on China where the peo-
ple are wealthier and have
more personal freedoms than
at any other time in this cen-
tury.

In this way Cuba could also
avoid the mas-

and

Castro.

When the Cuba problem is
mentioned in newspapers or
by U.S. policy makers, Castro
and the refugees are men-
tioned first, but the subject
invariably turns to the U.S.

, trade embargo that has been

in place against Cuba for the
past 32 years. As a way to
“punish” Castro, President
Clinton has imposed more
sanctions against Cuba
ranging from ‘ending charter
flights and cash flow into
the island to increasing
radio propaganda and com-
plaining to the United
Nations about alleged human
rights abuses taking place in
Cuba.

This is the same sort of
ignorant policy that Clinton’s

Taiwanese and South Korean
governments toward democ-
racies. That is just plain non-
sense. Economic growth and
the development of a middle
class are what has increased
the political power of the
people, not the government in
Washington.

Recently President Clinton
said that “the solution to
Cuba’s many problems is not
an uncontrolled exodus, it is
freedom and democracy for
Cuba.” Clinton is correct
when he asserts that a
mass exodus of the Cuban
people will not solve
that nation’s problems, but
he is off the mark when he
talks of freedom and democ-
racy in Cuba coming before
economic prosperity. I feel

Before imposing additional
sanctions the United States
should offer to drop the
embargo and engage the
Cuban government in talks
that deal with not only immi-
gration but also educational
exchanges, joint ventures and
tourism. Chances are Castro,
as the Chinese government
did, -would accept in the
hopes of holding on to politi-
cal power.

For now let Castro have
political power, but givethe
Cuban people some economic
power as well. For it is
through economic empower-
ment, and not Cold War
rhetoric, that Castro’s days
will truly be numbered.

t last year’s
Pitt—Seton
Hall basket-

ball game, after 1 pre-
sented my ticket and
ID to the usher, he
remarked, “You don’t
look like a typical

Columnist student!” 1 chuckled.
Rlck _ I’m not a typical stu-
NOWIln dent — while I’m on

campus fairly regular-
ly for one reason or another — most of
you reading this won’t ever see me.
I’m 33 years old, work during the day,
attend classes at night and take advan-
tage of cultural and athletic events that
the university offers on weekends. In
fact, by the time you read this, I’ll have
just attended my 15-year high school
class reunion!

I don’t participate much in campus
life anymore, although in my earlier
days at Pitt, I was active in a fraternity
—— I guess you can say that I’ve out-
grown it. I also, by choice, live in the
suburb of Swissvale, which is nowhere
near campus. (I’m a native of the East
End of Pittsburgh.)

And while the campus music scene is
dominated by rap and so—called altema-
tive, you will generally find me listen-
ing to jazz—fusion on my CD player
(no, I don’t have any Kenny G), and

The Pitt News, Tuesday, September 6, 1994

,Clumnist says he is nota typical college student

I’ve even played the saxophone in a
couple of bands around here. My
“spring break outing” last year was not
to Florida or Ocean City — a couple of
friends and I went to the Balcony in
Shadyside.

However, this much is clear: Even
though I don’t fit the profile or take
part in the culture of the average stu-
dent at the University of Pittsburgh, I
am most definitely a student at the
University of Pittsburgh. My brother
and sister—in-law gave me a Pitt sweat-
shirt for Christmas a couple of years
ago, and I wear it with pride. (That’s
right, this is my school. You got a prob-
lem with that?)

Of course, being a night student isn’t
easy — at least for a lot of people.
Many of my classmates are juggling
careers and family, not counting the
course load; as a single person, I don’t
really have to deal with those. Dress
clothing is more prevalent at night as
well; as I wear jeans to work anyway,
it’s not much of an issue. As I haven’t
had a car in nine years, I don’t have to
worry about parking either, although I
have heard the complaints. (In these
ways, I probably resemble more nor-
mal students.) However, the reason I go
to night school isn’t simply because I
have to be “more mature” and work
during the day; my major, media com-

munications, is offered only through
the College of General Studies.

But I think one of the differences
between us night students and the “tra—
ditional” student body is that we have a
better idea of where we want to go and
how to get there, and I have found that
preparation for the opportunities that
might come my way is paramount. The
truth is, I began writing columns for
The Pitt News back in November after
a couple of staffers visited my Intro to
Journalism class last year to recruit
writers (including editorial writers,
which is what I do best). I write not
just for my own enjoyment or to make
a few extra bucks — this is what I want
to do with my life, and I figure I’m get-
ting valuable experience at the same
time. On top of that, I do commentary
for a talk show on a local Christian
radio station, and this summer I
even spoke to someone down at
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette about
a possible internship! On the other
hand, when I first came to Pitt in the
fall of 1980, as a full—time chemistry
major, the idea was to make money
after I graduated — I fell flat on my
face.

But even though I am a night student,
I do have some fun. I go to Pitt football
games quite a bit (although I only
made the Virginia Tech debacle last

9

year) and visit the old frat house for
homecoming every year. Pitt basketball
is my passion; I missed only three
home games last year and one of those
was ‘due to class. In the future I plan to
take advantage of the theatrical produc-
tions that I used to attend as a tradition-
al‘ student, and I might get to the Jazz
Seminar concert this year. And I enjoy
interacting with The Pitt News staff —
that keeps my mind sharp, as well as
keeping me well-informed as to what’s
happening on campus.

Are the late hours worth it? You bet!
Although I would not have initially
chosen this path right out of high
school (in fact, I wanted to go to col-
lege outside of Pittsburgh then), I’m
glad to be here now, because I'm cer-
tainly grateful for the breaks I’ve got-
ten the past few years that might not
have come. And who knows? Maybe in

the next few years you’ll be reading I

my columns in a major daily newspa-
per, but before that, you’ll be hearing
from me (or cheering or swearingsat
me, depending on your orientation) for,
hopefully, the next two years. Pitt has
been a large part of my, life for a long
time, and I don’t see that changing —
even after I graduate.

Columnist We both
Tony Fung agreed that
a l t h o u g h

Pitt’s campus is diverse, there
seems to be a diversity problem
amongst the students. This
teacher told me the biggest
problem about Pitt’s racial ten-
is the silence; She

ed it’s the silent racism that is
most dangerous, you do not
know where it is coming from
or how to deal with it.
Everyone knows it’s out

there, but people seem to accept
it because they feel that’s the
way things are. People I have
talked to have said they do not
wantto accept things the way
they are. The question is, who
will take the initiative to change
things? Everyone seems to
blame everyone else for this
problem when it is brought up. I
think we have to stop blaming
and start deciding whether we
really want change or not. It is
hard to change people who are
set in their ways, especially
when it comes to racial hatred.
But for those who are tired of
the silence and are just accept-
ing the racial tension, they must
take the first step in stopping it.
I feel there is no one answer or
reason to end the racial tension
that will satisfy everyone, there-

fore it is up to each individual
to discover why they should
take a step, and what they can
do.

The first step I took was to
ignore the stereotypes that I
once had for certain ethnic
groups, and decided to treat
them as individuals. I realized
those stereotypes deprived me
of meeting new people who
may have made my life better
by being. friends with them.
After the initial step it felt like a
heavy weight was lifted off me.
I realized that if I had not been
afraid to talk to someone
because they were different, it
would have made a difference
in ending the silence. This was
what is working for me, and
like I said, people must find
their own reason and own goal

of what they feel they can do.

I feel that for those who want
change there are many possibil-
ities to make a difference. For
instance, together as Pitt stu-
dents we can demand more
awareness of the different types
of cultures here at Pitt. I have
known many students from
small communities who have
never seen a certain ethnic
group before. And that fear of
the unknown, perhaps com-
bined with negative things they
heard from other people, can
cause one to easily fear and hate
a certain group without getting
to know any individuals from
that group. I feel education is
crucial to break the silence.

Even as an individual, one
can make a massive difference.
The silence can be broken by a

simple hello. Most people don’t
take the time to greet another
person, thereby the silence, and
tension grows greater. These
examples of group and individ-
ual acts are just a small preview
of the vast possibilities of things
that can be done to end the
silence.

Relating this to tradition and
pride at Pitt, we must have unity
in order to have those two
things. I realized my first year

the pride of being at Pitt was

missing because people were
separating into their own
groups. Wanting and doing

something about this silence V

may bring back this tradition
and pride. It’s up to you to
make the first step.

upperclassmen. For the new
freshmen this year, I guess this is quite
an important transitional period in their
lives. It’s time to start over. Time to put
behind all glorious achievements of their
pre-college lives as they look onward in
search of bigger and better successes in
preparation for their first year of higher
education. It is also a time for indepen-
dence.

terms lightly) fools of ourselves in the

plans or grotesque-looking IDs —- but
something more obvious and undeniably
significant. We are all Pitt students with
one universal goal — to strive for an
education to better our opportunities in
an ever-increasingly, fast-paced and
demanding world. With this in mind, we

make our individual journeys to this one

allocated point. For us this happens to be
students at the University of Pittsburgh.
We come here from distinctly diverse
backgrounds, religions and ethnic ori-
gins with that one intrinsical link — that
one thing that unites us all or does it?

As college students, we are supposed-
ly in the prime of our lives, with for the
most part good, wholesome experiences
ahead of us to nurture and develop from.
So why have we so conveniently
allowed ourselves to be (in this clearly
positive environment) distracted by the
negative elements of our society. Correct
me if I’m wrong, but aren’t higher edu-
cational institutions supposed to be envi-
ronments where we should be able to

rise above such distractions, and when
necessary, critically review them in hope
of finding solutions to the problems
affecting us as a campus community? It
bothers me to think this is speedily
becoming not the case. It seems as if the
problems that for so long have been per-
manent fixtures of our society have
gradually created a stronghold, in what
used to be the least vulnerable of envi-
ronments —' our higher academic insti-
tutions. Don’t get me wrong though, I
fully understand colleges and universi-
ties have never been totally immune to
society’s conflicts but at least these
problems were addressed and examined
even if no suitable solvency was in sight.
These problems have over the years
increased from significant ones, such as
the color of your skin to truly embarrass-
ing ones such as what fraternity or social
etiquette you adhere to. The average col-
lege student simply is not very con-
cerned with the idealism of school pride
and unfortunately, if he or she is not at a

than just classes --we learn from each other

sports gathering, fails to see the need for
a bond of sorts with his or her col-
leagues. It appears as if we now just
come to these institutions solely to get
our education and be gone. What hap-
pened to the whole package, the whole
deal?.What happened to exploring the
diversity and experience of getting a
well-rounded education? My guess is as
good as yours!

We need to spend less time worrying
about the breakdown of our self—images
and open ourselves to other cultures,
groups and individuals in our campus
community. That in my opinion is the
key to a well-rounded education —
exploring new opportunities and experi-
ences. Realizing thatwe are all here to

learn and be educated by not only our _

lecturers, but more significantly by one
another, and one sure way we can
accomplish this is by realizing we are
Pitt students first.

pumped into their cheerless-
limbs like they haven’t had for
years.

After an almost entirely
uneventful season last year,
Pitt had the audacity to change
their 1994 motto to “Majoring
in excitement. ” But the
Panthers proved to 32,337 fans
in attendance on Saturday that
their new motto is no gim-
mick.

Pitt may have lost the game
30-28, a game that they could
have and should have won, but
the Panthers showed that they
are no longer the doormat to
ranked teams. Most important-
ly, they showed a punch in
their offense that they desper-
ately lacked last year.

“I feel that we have a more
complete offense this year, and
I feel we are going to be more
explosive,” running back
Curtis Martin said. “We don’t
just want to get 200 yards
rushing, we want it in passing,
we want it in the air and we
want to run.

“I feel that we made a U-
turn as far as our attitude. No
one is doubting us, no one is
doubting ourselves. We have
the attitude now that we don’t
care if the Steelers are out
there, we’re going to box.”

In one game, Pitt exceeded
the amount of highlights and
excitement that they had all of
last season.

Last year’s highlights could
be summed up with a 14-10
upset victory at Southern
Mississippi, coming two yards
shy of beating Syracuse and
Martin’s personal reel.

Against Texas, Pitt peppered
the game with highlights.

«Martin rushed for 251 yards,
the most ever rushed against
the Longhorns. Also, Martin’s
performance was the seventh-
best rushing game in school
history.

Walk-on kicker Dave
Merrick’s 54-yard ﬁeld goal
broke a school record, and Pitt
came,within a two-point con-
version away from tying
Texas.

offense, which averaged 15
points a game last year,

Pitt quarterback Sean Fitzgerald reacts just after Pitt's two-point conversion attempt failed.
Fitzgerald's pass to Chad Askew fell incomplete as Texas beat Pitt, 30-28.

Tony Dorsett, was honored at
halftime, Martin put up some
legendary, numbers. Martin
crashed through the Texas
defense for more yards, 251 on
28 carries, than any back ever
has against Texas in its history.
Texas Christian University’s
Jim Swink held the previous
record of 235 yards against the
1955 Longhorns.

“Curtis Martin is phenome-
nal. He is a phenomenal back,”
Majors said. “All the great

ones are different. He gets up
in the pile and comes out like
very few people I’ve seen.”

Martin’s demonstration was
the seventh-best rushing effort
in Pitt history and the best
since Curvin Richards’ 264 in
1989.

However, Martin was not the
only back churning out the
yards on Saturday as the Texas
duo.of Rodrick Walker and
Anthony Holmes combined for
189 yards on the ground.

“Having Tony Dorsett here
probably didn’t hurt any of
their running,” Mackovic said.
“They were all running like
they wanted to make sure that
Tony noticed them. I’m posi-
tive he noticed Curtis.”

Panthers break Buckne||'s series jinx

Prex scores  

winner in
opener

By Brett Fondrk
Staﬂ Writer

The third time was the
charm for the Pitt soccer team.
After losing to Bucknell the
last two seasons in a row, the
Panthers defeated the Bisons
1-0 in the season opener for
both teams at Pitt Stadium
Sunday.

Senior forward,Eric Prex
scored the lone Panther goal
midway through the second
half as he beat Bison goal-
tender Corey Harbold to the
right side of the net.

“Mike Dyer had the ball,
everybody just went the one
way and I made my run the
other way,” Prex said. “Mike
saw it and he made a beautiful
pass. He should get credit for
the goal because he laid it right
on my foot.”

The one goal was all Pitt (1-
0) needed as senior goaltender
Kirk Brodows shone in the net.
Brodows, who has been bat-
tling junior Adam Spitzer dur-

ing the preseason for the posi-
tion of goalie, was told right
efore game time that he
would be the starter.
“We both know how it
works; this has been going on

‘for a couple years now,”

Brodows said. “You come in
and say, ‘I’ve got to be ready
to play.’ We both come down
and loosen up. Weboth expect
to play.” .

“They’re both neck and
neck,” coach Joe Luxbacher
said. “But you’ve got to pick
one. You can only have one
goalkeeper.”

“Kirk played well. He came
up big when he had to. He
controlled the air and basically
did what we expect him to do.”

The Bisons never really
threatened as Pitt dominated
action until the waning
moments of the contest.

Bucknell (0- 1) had just taken
their third straight comer kick
when the referee’s whistle
blew as both teams fought for
the ball in front of the Pitt net.
A foul was called against the
Panthers. Bucknell screamed
for a penalty kick which could
have meant a tie game.

However, the referee award-
ed the Bisons an indirect free
kick. The ensuing kick
bounced harmlessly off the left
goal post and out of bounds.

Pitt got possession of the ball,
and, a few minutes later, the
game was history.

“The truth of the matter is
that it was a violation in the
box,” Bucknell coach Craig
Reynolds said. “The referee
called a non-violent charge. I
don’t think there is such a
thing as an indirect non-violent

charge. I think there is a direct
kick, which would have been a
penalty kick.”

“He should have said it was
something else. He made the
call. He saw the foul. He tried
to come up with something

Basketball coach
receives multi-year
contract extension

Sports Editor

A four-year "contract exten-
sion has been given to Lady
Panther basketball coach Kirk
Bruce by the University of
Pittsburgh.

Bruce, who has been the
head coach at Pitt for the past

nine sea-

sons, com-

most suc-

  pleted his

1993 - 94.
Bruce led
the Lady
Panthers to
a 21-10 performance, a Pitt
single-season record 12 Big
East Conference wins and a

third-place finish in the
National Women’s Invitational
Tournament.

It was the first time Pitt had
qualified for post-season play
since 1981.

“The Pitt women’s basket-

Bruce has made steady
improvement over the last few
years and is now recognized as
one of the top women’s pro-
grams in the Big East,”
Athletic Director Oval Jaynes
said. —

Most Pitt students were
probably getting ready to see
the Pitt football team open its
season against the Texas
Longhorns last Saturday mom-
ing at Pitt Stadium.

However, the football team
was not the only Pitt team to
open its
season on
Saturday.
By the
time the
football
game had
. . started at
noon, the Pitt volleyball team
had already taken care of busi-
ness against Illinois State.

Chosen as thepreseason
choice to win the conference
title, according to the Big East
Volleyball Preseason Coaches
Poll, the Lady Panthers did not
disappoint, as they won their
first match of the year by

The Pitt News, Tuesday, September 6, 1994

Weekend split for volleyball

sweeping the Redbirds of
Illinois State 15-3, 15-11 and
15-7, respectively.

The entire match took 57
minutes and saw the team lead
a well-balanced attack. This
was definitely a big win con-
sidering that Illinois State was
ranked in the Top 25 last year,
even though it had lost some
of its starters.

“Going into your first match
you are mostly concerned with
how you are going to per-
form,” assistant coach Brian
Begor said. “I think you have
suspicions of how you’ll play,
but until you take the floor you
really don’t have any idea.”

“I think we were pretty
pleased, particularly because
we’ve had some injuries. We
had a setter who was in her
first season, and that is kind of
like Pitt going out and playing
Texas this weekend with a
first-year quarterback; there’s
always some anxiety involved
with that.”

Open letter to the University community

Parking permit fees will increase for Fiscal Year 1995, the first increase in monthly rates since September

1990. Monthly rates in lots and garages will increase by only $5.00 while two permit types will increase by
$7.50 per month (ZZ and VN). A concerted effort by the parking staff to keep fees as low as possible is
demonstrated by the modest amount of the increase. Transient and evening student permit rates will also
increase slightly. Rate increases are effective Aug. 1, 1994. Carpoolers will retain the current rates this year.

[While no one is ever happy about increased ‘fees, you will find that ours continue to be among the lowest

compared to other Oakland parking rates.

The budget for the Parking Office is a little more than $4.5 million. As an auxiliary of the University, the
Parking Office must provide all services without any University appropriated dollars. All costs of operations
are paid for by the revenues generated. Of particularnote is that 44.7 percent of each dollar is spent to
satisfy taxes, debt services and facility rental. ’

Each year between _8 percent and 12 percent of the budget is spent for day to day maintenance. This
includes snow removal, cleaning and repair of equipment. We now have an aggressive program that
accomplishes maintenance on a scheduled basis thus avoiding deterioration of our facilities. However, the
operating budgetdoes not provide sufficient funds to accomplish major repairs. For example, during the
past year, 81.2 million was spent for overdue major renovation of garages, which included concrete
restoration, resurfacing, new lighting and emergency phones.

It is now necessary to ensure that there are sufficient funds to properly and regularly maintain our
facilities. Those who park in Forbes Quad know that there is a problem with leaks from the ceiling. While
the torn membrane that covers the garage is not the responsibility of the Parking Office, the damage to the
ﬂoors of the garage from standing water is handled through the parking budget. The projected repair cost is
in excess of $400,000, and that repair must be done very soon before the deteriorationforces the closure of

the garage.

Emergency telephones were installed in nine locations in Fiscal Year 1994; an additional seven lots have
been identified for emergency telephone installation this year. Security was improved in one lot and three
garages. The Department has led in the new campus lighting program. Lighting in three facilities was
upgraded this past year and plans to upgrade lighting in seven locations are underway this fiscal year.
Fifteen lots will be paved or sealed and restriped this summer and two garages were painted. However,
parking reserves will be exhausted after these repairs are completed. In order to plan for a regular program
of reconstruction, additional revenues must be generated. I

We are constantly seeking other ways of increasing revenue. One example is that through our parking
enforcement assistants, who celebrate their one year anniversary in August, parking lot utilization is more
efficiently managed. Fair and consistent enforcement has provided 270 more spaces for use by permit
holders that previously were used by illegal parkers.

We will continue to review operations and reduce expenditures so that future increases are as consistent
with cost of living increases as possible. I appreciate your concerns about increases throughout the
University, and I assure you that everyone in the Department of Parking Transportation is cognizant of our
mission to provide quality services at reasonable rates.

Newly named team captain
Carrie Thornton wasted no
time in assuming her role as
team leader. She led the way
with 13 kills out of 18 attempts
along with 5 digs, and junior
outside hitter Sara Mitchell
followed with 10 kills out of
18 attempts as well.

First-year transfer Stephanie
Dufresne contributed with 31
set assists, 4 digs, and 5 block
assists.

Saturday’s opening game
also saw the return of last
year’s first-team All Big East
selection Annemarie Memagh,
who had five digs to her credit.
Melanie Gustafson and Sarah
Mikla also combined for 10
kills, as sophomore Laurie
Fernandez added seven digs.

“Our ball handling as a team
had improved, passing wise
and defensively. Our blocking
up on the net has been greatly
improved this year,” head
coach Cindy Alvear said.

Sunday afternoon at 1 p.m.,
the Lady Panthers lined up
against host Rhode Island.
This time the results were not
as favorable as URI knocked
off Pitt in three consecutive
games to take the match and
drop the team to 1-1.

Thornton, Mitchell and
Gustafson each led the way in
kills, and Mitchell, along with
Sarah Mikla, also led the way
in digs with 10. _

Due to the team’s checklist
of injuries, Alvear and Begor
have been forced to change
things around.

“At this point we have a lot
of position changes this year,”
Alvear said. “Carrie Thornton
moved from the left side to the
right side, and Sarah Mikla
moved from the middle to the
right side.” V

The team is now looking to
establish some type of chem-
istry.

“At this point in the season
Rhode Island isn’t any better
than us,” Alvear said, “but
they are just better organized
right now.”

Begor agrees that organiza-
tion is the key to winning early
in the year.

“Any time you lose, you
have to applaud your oppo-
nent,” Begor said. “I think
Rhode Island played really
well. They have a very experi-
enced team back. They are
probably further along than we
are at this point just because
they are comfortable with each
other.”

“We were in position to win
the second game,” Begor said,
“We made a couple of bad
decisions and didn’t make a
couple of plays we needed to,
and had we won the second
game, I think the match would
have been dramatically differ-
ent. It would have given us a
lift, and I think it‘ would have
taken the wind out of Rhode
Island’s sails a little bit
because they were playing

well, and when that didn’t hap- '

pen we were in trouble.”

"Cutback" Curtis
Morfin rushes for most yards in lOl -year Texas history

By Keith Pompey
Senior Staff Writer

Saturday was supposed to be
Tony Dorsett day, but instead
another great running back
took center stage.

During halftime, Pitt offi-
cials extended a Hall of Fame
tribute to the greatest running
back in Panther history.

Dorsett was inducted into
the Pro Football Hall of Fame
on July 30. The former
Heisman trophy winner will be
inducted into the College
Football Hall of Fame later
this year.

But on the field, Curtis
Martin dazzled the crowd. The
6-feet 200-pound senior car-
ried the ball 28 times for a
career-high 251 yards and one
touchdown.

For his effort, Martin broke
Jim Swink’s (Texas Christian
University) 1955 single-game
rushing record against a Texas
defense. Also, Martin was only
52 yards short of Dorsett’s sin-
gle game record of 303 yards
that was set against Notre
Dame in 1975.

“He’s a pretty good back
isn’t he?” Texas head coach
John Mackovic said. “A thou-
sand yards last year and he’s
well on his way, it looks like,
this year. He’s a terrific back,
and there were times when we
thought we had him stopped in
the backfield and he was able
to get by.

“Having Tony Dorsett here
probably didn’t hurt any of his
runs. [Both teams’ running
backs] were all running like
they wanted to make sure
Tony noticed them. I’m posi-
tive he noticed Curtis.”

“Curtis Martin is phenome-
nal,” added Pitt head coach
Johnny Majors. “He is a phe-
nomenal running back. All the
great ones are different. Gale
Sayers was different, Dorsett
was different. They’re all great
cause they had their unique
traits. [Martin] gets up in the
pile and comes out like very
few people I’ve seen.”

During the 30-28 loss to the
18th-ranked Longhorns,
Martin looked every bit a great
back. In the first half, he used
his 4.4 speed to frustrate Texas
as he rushed 16 times for 146
yards.

“It was chaos out there at
first,” Longhorn senior line-
backer Norman Watkins said.
“Basically, [the Panthers] were
running two or three plays and
they were killing us with the
draw, killing us with that
counter. They kept on running
it and we couldn’t stop it.

“He is a good back. He is
quicker than what I thought he
was in film. We were missing
tackles. Martin is a good back
[but] there is no excuse for
him to get those type of
yards.”

With 32,337 screaming fans
chanting and Dorsett in the

Martin had the seventh-best rushing day in Pitt history
against the Longhorns on Saturday.

crowd, Martin had a chance of
breaking Pitt’s single-game
rushing record.

But as the game wore on, the
All—American and Doak
Walker Award candidate’s
numbers began to slide.

The product of Allderdice
High School only carried the
ball three times in the fourth
quarter, smashing all hopes of
breaking Dorsett’s single-game
rushing record.

But according to Martin.
who ended the game with the
seventh-best single-game per-
formance in Pitt history, it
didn’t phase him.

“I feel I had the most energy
at the end,” Martin said. “But
that was the coach’s choice. I
didn’t question it. The coach-
es, I feel are always right, they
prepare me. I just follow what
they say. I feel they know
what’s better for me. So I have

no complaints about any-
thing.”

Martin also added that he
felt if his number would have
been called during the two-
point play, the Longhorns
would have been ready.

“Personally I am not saying
the coaches should have or
should not have called it,” he
said.

“But they would have defi-
nitely keyed on me on that
two-point play. I feel that was
a good call going away from
me for the two-point play. But
sometimes you just come up
short.”

Instead of griping about
what could have happened,
Martin talked about the good
things that came about after
this loss.

“We learned as a whole team

that we can compete with any-

thought we had him stopped in
the backfield and he was able
to shake and get by,” Mackovic
said. I

“I just give credit to my
offensive line and my full-
back,” Martin said.

Despite Martin’s impressive
output, Pitt displayed a bal-
anced offensive attack that saw
219 yards out of 489 total
come through the air.

However, the Panthers com-
mitted numerous mistakes that
proved to be more costly than
the failed two-point conver-
sion.

Martin started the scoring in
the first quarter with a 2—yard
touchdown run as Pitt capital-
ized on a drive that began on
the Texas 25. Transfer kicker

David Merrick missed the‘

extra point.

Two drives later, Texas
answered with a 17-play, 80-
yard march that ended with a
Holmes 8—yard TD jaunt up the
middle.

The Panthers struck back 17

seconds later on a 64-yard
touchdown pass from
Fitzgerald to wide receiver
Dietrich Jells. On the play,
Longhorns cornerback Joey
Ellis got his legs tangled up
with Jells’. Ellis fell leaving
Jells wide open and left the
game with an injury. Pitt led at
that point 13-7.

In his Division I debut,
Fitzgerald completed 12 of 25
attempts for 219 yards, two
touchdowns and one intercep-
tion.

“I’d say I was average,”
Fitzgerald said.

After Longhorns QB Shea
Morenz capped off a 76-yard
drive with a touchdown toss
that gave Texas a two-point
advantage, the Panthers retali-
ated with a Merrick 54-yard
field goal. Merrick’s blast was
the longest in Pitt history,
breaking the previous record of
52 yards held by three others.

“I just kick the ball wherever
they put it,” Merrick said.

On the Longhorns’ ensuing
drive, the Panther defense

David Merrick kicked a school-record 54-yard field goal.

forced a fourth-and-two situa-
tion. Pitt’s Billy Davis then
slammed into Texas punter
David Vacek, drawing a rough-
ing-the—kicker penalty against
Pitt and giving the Longhorns
a second chance.

Eight plays later, Mor,enz
zipped a 3-yard touchdown
strike to tight end Jimmy

Hakes. It was the first big mis-
cue for the Panthers and Texas
was handed a 21-16 lead.

Pitt answered with a 62-yard
drive that stalled on the
Longhorn 18 when linebacker
Kevin Whatler sacked
Fitzgerald, causing a fumble.
Jason Reeves recovered for
Texas and the Longhorns took

the five-point lead into the
half.

“There were a lot of big
plays, and that was one of
them,” Mackovic said.

Martin, however, managed to
turn in the most spectacular
play of the afternoon before
the intermission. The Pitt tail-
back took the handoff up the
gut, broke right and bolted 38
yards up the Panther sideline,
setting up a 47-yard missed
field goal attempt by Merrick
with five seconds left.

In the second half, Texas’
Juan Kemp scored first on a
two-yard scamper, putting the
Longhorns up 27-16. The drive
was sustained] on a third-and-
six play when Pitt’s Mike
Mohring sacked Morenz but
was called for a facemask
penalty that gave Texas an
automatic first down.

Pitt responded on successive
series with two Merrick field
goals of 33 and 22 yards, and
after three quarters the score
stood at 27-22. _

With six minutes,.10 seconds
left in the game, Fitzgerald was
intercepted by Texas safety

5 Victor Frazier at the Pitt 42.

Three plays later Phil Dawson
connected on a 50-yard field
goal, making it 30-22
Longhorns. ‘

“We made two, three, four
critical errors against our-
selves,” Majors said. “In close
games like this you can’t do
that and win consistently.”

Then withjl:4l left and
Texas trying to run out the
clock, cornerback Denorse
Mosely stripped Holmes and
linebacker Jason Chavis recov-
ered at the Texas 48-.

Four plays later, Fitzgerald

showed vast improvement.
The Panthers’ offense racked
up 489 total yards as opposed
to Texas, which was rated as
one of the top offenses in the
country, which had 370 total
yards in 22 more plays.

Pitt’s offensive difference
was largely due to Martin’s
play, but the Panthers also
struck from the air. ‘

Junior college transfer quar-
terback Sean Fitzgerald, who
was starting in his first major
college game, amassed more
passing yards, 219, than high-
ly—acclaimed Longhorn QB
Shea Morenz, who threw for
179 yards in 12 more attempts.

“The better we get,'the more.
explosive and exciting we’ll
be. I think the games will be
more exciting,” Torn Bamdt
said. .

With one of ‘the toughest
schedules in the country, Pitt
probably won’t grasp the tradi-
tion that it had in the past, but
one thing is for certain —
football in Oakland will be
much more exciting.

The Panthers also had their
share of opportunities to put
more points on the board but
failed to convert on a number
of occasions.

“In the first half we could
have had a couple of goals,”
Luxbacher said.

“I was on our forwards at
halftime because they weren’t
pulling the trigger. AWe passed
up some good chances. We
played just good enough to
win.”

Pitt will be looking to break ‘

another streak next week as
they face SUNY Buffalo,

another team the Panthers have
failed to beat for two years in a
row.

“Buffalo always gives us
trouble,” Prex said. “We
haven’t beaten them since I’ve
been here. We tied them last

year, and they beat us the year.

before.”

“We’ve got to play better
soccer,” Luxbacher said. “The
first game is always the tough-
est. Hopefully, you make your
most improvement between
the first and second game.”

“Buffalo_is a good, solid
club that is very similar to us.
It should be a good test.”

the season. We also feel that

If Martin continues to keep
his head up and look for the
positives instead of the nega-
tives, this could be a very
interesting season for the
Panthers.

Who knows. maybe he
might get another crack at the
record!

later that he had his choice of
two receivers on the fade route
Pitt called on the two-point
attempt.

The Pitt QB chose to loft the
ball to the six—feet—four—inch
Askew who was being covered
by Ellis’ backup at comer, Taje
Allen instead of Butler streak-
ing across the goal line.

“Working the field, I thought
I had a better shot there,”
Fitzgerald said.

Martin, who had 236 yards
through three quarters and
only 15 in the final period, was
left out of the two-point play.

“I definitely feel like they
were keying on me on the two-
point play,” Martin said. “It
was a good call to go away
from me.”

However, the Panthers
reﬂected more on their missed
opportunities than the missed
conversion. .

“The team with the fewest
mistakes is gonna win the foot-
ball game,” linebacker Tom
Tumulty said. “One thing we
didn’t lack though is fight.”

“I think it’s a lot to build
on,” Majors said. “It’s pretty
tough to lose one like that
because its not gonna come
easy for us to win.”
