Regular Edition

New Cathedral
  Library To Open
By Second Term

Browsing Room, Larger Quarters
To Feature Facilities; Stacks
Placed On Two Floors

Three Floors Reserved

The new University library, on the
fourth, ﬁfth and sixth ﬂoors of the
Cathedral, will be ready for use by
students in February, John Weber,
business manager of the University,
announced.

Plans for the library feature the
main lending room on the ﬁfth ﬂoor
of the Belleﬁeld Street side and the
general stack room immediately un-
derneath, on the fourth ﬂoor. The
periodical room will be located on the
Forbes Street wing of the ﬁfth ﬂoor,
with the reference stacks on the Fifth
Avenue side.

The ﬁfth ﬂoor will also include the
main reference reading rooms and
all other formal reading rooms. The
eagerly awaited “browsing” rooms for
both men and women will take up the
Bigelow wing and the Belleﬁeld wing.
respectively, on the sixth ﬂoor. Small
campus dances and meetings may be
held here. .

Students using the ﬁfth ﬂoor read-
ing rooms will also be able to prom-

.enade on the lower roofs during favor-

able weather. Undergraduates will be
especially interested in the unusual
Alldred Memorial Rooms, where no
serious study may be done. With only
reading of good books for pleasure
allowed, no textbooks may be carried
into this division.

The famous Darlington memorial
collection, now housed in the Western
Pennsylvania Historical Society build-
ing, will be made available to students
in the enlarged University library. The
books in this group will not be cir-
culated, only responsible students and
graduates being permitted to use
them.

Consultations are now being held.
Mr. Weber added, with artists who
will design the stained glass windows
for the Heinz Memorial Chapel. The
chapel will be completed with the ad-
dition of these windows.

begun on this room within a few
months.

YW-YMCA Plan
1935 Fall Retreat

Steere Of Haverford Will Speak;
Faculty, Students To Attend

The annual Fall Retreat, one of the
outstanding events of the YW-YMCA

7 calendar, will be held at Trinity Man-

or on Saturday and Sunday. W. W.
Mendenhall, executive secretary of the
YMCA, said that about 50 members of
the faculty and students would at-
tend.

Dr. Douglas Steere, head of the de-
partment of philosophy at Haverford
College, will be the principal speaker.
According to Mendenhall, “The re-
treatwill be a splendid opportunity for
an honest and energetic discussion of
the affairs and problems of the day
besides topics of true spiritual sig-
niﬁcance.”

Students interested in this retreat
should make reservations as soon as
possible either at Heinz House or at
the Y Hut. The party will leave the
First Baptist Church, situated at the‘

corner of Bayard street and Belleﬁeld

avenue, at 1 o’clock Saturday by auto-
mobile, and will adjourn at approx-
imately 4:3O o’clock Sunday. The
total expense will be two dollars.

Settlement Workers
To Meet Wednesday

The YM and YWCA will collaborate
in holding a social service ﬁeld day
on Wednesday, in Room 1309, Cathe-
dral, from 2:30 to 5 o’clock.

The meeting will be attended by
those students who have signed up in
classes as being interested in social

‘work and will give them an oppor-

tunity to become acquainted with set-
tlement house workers. The affair will
also serv'e as a clearing house for plac-
ing those interested in settlement
house work.

The new group will be directed by
Miss Helen C. Battrick, executive sec-
retary of the YMCA, and Dr. Harold
A. Phelps, professor of sociology. The
new group will probably be called the
Pitt Service Club.

Exhibition Of Creative Art
Scheduled To Open Today

An exhibition of creative art opens
today in the Fine Arts library in
State Hall and will continue for the
balance of the week.

The exhibit is the work of students
in last year’s classes in creative art
taught by Philip Elliott, assistant pro-
fessor of ﬁne arts. He stated that the
work being carried on by students
under his direction this year will be
greatly aided because a larger room
has been assigned where each student
will have ample space in which to
work.

Biddle Prediction ln;
World Moves On

One of the toughest gambles we
know—betting on the results of
men's fraternitiy rushing —— has
seized the office of the dean of men.

Theodore W. Biddle, assistant
dean of men, who once used to toss
off predictions on those results
with reckless abandon, today au-
thorized publication of his guesses
in competition with those submit-
ted by N. Roberts Seidle, assistant
to the dean of men. Biddle’s ﬁgures,
on which he’s staked half a dozen
new golf balls, are: 531 bids for
364 men with 152 acceptances.
Seldle’s totals were 565 bids for 380
men with 165 acceptances.

Last year Seidle lost out on a
heavy bet of a box of candy to his
secretary, Alice Beatty. Biddle, in
his time, has scored a few near
bulls-eyes mixed amid many wild,
wild guesses.

Ethiopian War
Crisis Provides
Meeting Topic

Dr. B. J. Hovde, associate professor
of history, spoke on the “Causes and
Background of the Italo-Ethiopian Sit-
uation" at the ﬁrst meeting of Pi Tau
Phi, honorary scholastic fraternity of
the College, held last Thursday eve-
ning at the Y Hut.

Dr. Hovde discussed the present
crisis in terms of the pre-war. desire
of Italy for African possessions, which
was not appeased by the Treaty of
Versailles. He pointed out the rela-
tion of the present situation to that
under the Triple Entente and the
Triple Alliance. After Dr. Hovde’s ad-
dress, Israel Goldberg, ’36, president
of the organization, appointed several
committees.

Members of the social committee
are: Jane Robertson, ’36, chairman,
Sylvia Fixel, ’36, and Reuben Stutch,
’36. .
The eligibility committee, who will
select additional senior members of
the organization, is composed of Leah
Stark, ’36, chairman, Louise McKirdy,
’36, and William Schanbacher, ’36.

Goldberg will head the program com-

Initteervvith Herrymon MaLurer,~5"36»,- and

Leonard Schwartz, ’36, as the other
members.

Inquiry Forum

To Hear Hovde

As the third speaker of the semes-
ter, Inquiry Forum will present Dr, B.
J. Hovde, associate professor of his-
tory on Wednesday, at 12:30‘ o’clock.
Dr. Hovde will speak on “Principles
of Progressivism.”

Katherine Monori, co-chairman of
the program committee of Inquiry
Forum, stated that Dr. Hovde is pre-
sented to the campus at the request
of several students who heard him ad-
dress Pi Tau Phi, Lonorary scholastic
fraternity, and felt that the campus
should be given a chance to hear him
in an open meeting.”

.Dr. Hovde was head of the Public
Relations division of the Allegheny
County Emergency Relief Board, dur-
ing the past year. He is considered
one of the outstanding liberals of the

Pittsburgh district, and an authority
on. progressivism.

. Dr. if-Iovde’s talk will center around
progressive doctrines as they have ap-
peared in political and social move-
ments in the last hundred years, and
the inﬂuence those doctrines have ex-
erted upon human events.

Inquiry will be held in Room 107,

Alumni Hall. All students are in-
vited.

FreshmenTo Buy
Own Lunch N ow
Until Next Term

Rushing Ceases As Silence Period,
Interviews Of Freshmen Begin;
Fraters Wait In Suspense

A phrase borrowed from the pop-
ular song, “What a Difference a Day
Makes,” might well apply to the fra-
ternity situation among the Greek-

letter men today. At 2 o’clock yester-
day morning all _fraternity rushing
activities ceased, and the silence
period began. No more free lunches
today, no more dances tonight, -no
more ping pong tomorrow for the
freshman, at least during this week.

The Interfraternity -Council rules
forbid any fraternity member or
pledge from communicating in any
direct or indirect manner with newly-
registered students, beginning yester-
day and extending until next Monday,
October 21, at 5 o’clock in the after-
noon. -

By this morning bids will have been
received at the dean of men’s ofﬁce,
as submitted by the fraternities. The
groups must enter their bids by 9:30
o’clock today.

Beginning today, and extending
through the week, the dean of men's
ofﬁce will issue these invitations.

Fraternity men must wait until next

‘Monday at 5 o’clock in the afternoon,

when the ofﬁce of the dean will notify
them as to the acceptances and de-
clinations. Pledging by the fratern-
ities will take place that evening.

N. Robert Seidle, assistant to the
dean of men in charge of fraternities,
will interview freshmen this week.

Men interested in pledging a frater-
nity should bear in mind the rule that
any newly-registered student who does
not accept an invitation to nledgeship
during this week, may not do so for
one month.

Law Club Meets
To Plan Smoker

Group Plans To Draw Women
To Affair 0.c.t0.ber...22. 

John Marshall Club, honorary pre-
legal fraternity, will hold its regular
business meeting tomorrow night, at
the Y Hut. At this time, according to
Frank Reich, C36, president, plans will
be made for the fraternity’s annual
smoker, to be held on October 22.

At the smoker, plans will be made
to acquaint all pre-legal students with
the functions of John Marshall Club.
All freshmen and sophomore pre-legal

students, both men and women, will

be feted.
This will mark the ﬁrst time that
John Marshall Club has made a drive

to interest pre-legal women in their

activities.

Recently appointed committees will
present reports of their work at the
meeting. The committees are, Con-
stitution, of which Reuben Slesinger,
BA36, is chairman; Program, headed
by Howard Lutz, BA36; Membership,
consisting of Albert Luttrell, C36,
Reich, and Sarah Reish, C36, and a
committee set up to investigate the
possibilities of a tie-up among the pre-
legal fraternities of the entire coun-
try, consisting of Emanuel Krupp,
BA36, and Hubert Teitlebaum, C37.

Quill Club To Name ‘Staff

For ‘Journeyman’ Issue

The editorial staff of the “Journey-
man,” magazine of the Quill Club,
honorary literary fraternity, will be
announced tomorrow night at the
meeting of that club. One position on
the staff will be held by a person not
belonging to Quill.

The meeting will take place at the-

Y hut at 8:15 o’clock. Wilma SchreiI1-
er, C37, will read a one-act play
written by Peter Alapas, -C36, and
Jean Barnes, C38, will also read.

Freshmen Will Cram

; For First: Exam

Freshman men. who began this
year an intensive course in Univer-
sity orientation, undergo tomorrow
and Thursday the usual concom-
itants of regular classes: a test.

Since Freshman Week, the new
men have been wearing green
‘~‘Pit1:” buttons on campus.’ They
have already been informed that
the insignia are not permanent, but
that “after passing an examination
required of all freshmen,” they will
be presented gold and blue pins.

‘ The time has‘ come. At first 'hour
classes tomorrow, the men sched-
uled for Tuesday sessions will be
asked about traditions, cheers, ad-
rninistrative officials, and songs.
Thursday the other half of the class
of '39 will face the same problems.

 According to the dean of men's
office, a passing grade is set at 70.

All-Nations Day
At Theta House,
I  Or So It Seems

§The Kappa Alpha Theta house these
days has been seriously considering
hanging out all manner of bunting pro-
claiming international day or some-
thing.

iln the past week “our little cousins”
fl.9lOII1 various distant lands have been
making the “Theta” home their head-

over the weekend.

Panth e r Prowls
Again Wednesday

The funny side of football will be
the theme of the October issue of the
Pitt Panther, according to Russell
Connolly, C36, editor. The magazine,
encased in a sparkling yellow and
black cover, is due to appear on the
campus Wednesday morning.

William “Biff” Glassford, star varsity
football guard, breaks into print as
the author of an article on the laughs
that develop on the gridiron. Rumor
has it, however, that Paul “Bomber”
Shaw, sophomore end, is responsible
for many of the humorous yarns which
Glassford tells. S

While football is the theme of the
issue, it does not follow that it is the
only thing that the Panther staff can

_ write on. Ruth A. Nickel, C37, proves

that “yo11 can never tell” in her story
of the same name. A treatise on a
new insurance wrinkle adopted by
University football ticket agencies to
protect customers against inclement
weather is propounded (or is it pro-
mulgated?) by Al Bert, C36. James
Donoghue, C38, is responsible for a
bit of light political dialogue.

Besides all this there will be more
gossip dished out by the unknown Pan-
ther Prowler, whom no one knows
but upon whose head rests a free
year’s subscription. All the regular
features will be in the magazine, and
the editor promises, in addition, that

there will be more cartoons than ever.

Ada Bella, Oﬂ" For France,
Boards Cathedral Elevator

By Ron

Ada Bella was in The Pitt News
ofﬁce Friday afternoon.

She took a long look at the tidy
little place, drank in the sight of the
heaps of torn copy paper on the ﬂoor
and shirt-sleeved slaves around the
copy desk, winked at a few of the
cuter freshman reporters, and then,
amid innumerable farewells and calls
of “Happy Landings” took an elevator
for Europe.

Miss Bella won’t be seen around
Pittsburgh for many a long day. For
at least 10 months she’ll call the Uni-
versity of Grenoble in the province of
Dauphine, France, her _new Alma
Mater.

With a pocket full of rye (or maybe
centimes and francs) Miss Bella, a
June graduate from the School of Ed-
ucation, makes ready to board the
Ile de France in New York this Sat-
urday morning, for a six-day trip to
Havre. Besieged by a horde of News
staff members for a slice of French
money as keepsakes, our heroine went
altruistic and decided that the boys
on the ship who do the fetching and
carrying could use the franc pieces
to better advantage.

While at the University she was a
member of the French Club for two
years, and appeared in the club’s an-
nual play last spring. According to
Miss Blossom Henry, assistant pro-
fessor of modern languages, she was
one of the University’s better students
of French; according to the records of
the School of Education, she rated
one of the few A grades in practice
teaching last year.

A transfer from Bethany -College,
she is a member of Alpha Xi Delta so-
cial fraternity.

Although Grenoble does not award
master's degrees, Miss Bella will fol-
low a course of study normally lead-
ing to such a degree in French.

While in New York this week she
will visit with her former roommate
at the Kappa Alpha Theta house, Al-
ice Elson, C35, former president of
Theta Alpha Phi, honorary dramatic
fraternity.

It will be Miss Bella’s second trip
to Europe. She was in France and
Northern Italy (where she has rela-
tives) in 1926, accompanied by her
parents. On this trip she made a short
stop in Paris—not, she says, to send

home postcards.

Freshman Dance
-Scheduled Today

Mixer Party Tickets Obtainable
By Pitt Buttons, Armbands

If there be any Scotch instincts in

‘the’ m‘embers"’of"‘the “freshman class,‘

there will probably be a perpetual mob
surrounding Heinz House and Room
801, Cathedral today. Free tickets for
the ﬁrst freshman mixer dance, to be
held from 4 to 6 o’clock today in Heinz
House, are still available. William
Buhl’s orchestra will play for the
dances.

Tickets for the dance on Thursday
afternoon will be issued Tuesday, an-
nounced Lula Sekey, Ed37, chairman
of the social committee of WSGA.

Freshman men and women are to
attend the mixer dances as guests of
the University. The social committee
of WSGA sponsors the dances to af-
ford an opportunity for men and wo-
men of the ﬁrst year class to make
new acquaintances, and to establish
pleasant social relationships.

Freshman badges a11d pins will be
shown to identify the ﬁrst year stu-
dents desiring tickets. Men may pro-
cure their tickets from Theodore W.
Biddle in the ofﬁce of the dean of
men, Room 801, Cathedral; and the
women may get theirs from Miss Mary
Garber, in the ofﬁce of the dean of
women, Heinz House. Those who at-
tend today’s dance should not apply
for tickets for the Thursday dance
until that day, so that their fellow
classmates have a chance to attend.

Ten upperclass women were selected
by Miss Sekey to act as hostesses at
the dances. They are: Eleanor Fedi-
gan, Ed37; Irene Maroney, C38; Lois
Follansbee, Ed37; Harriet Lewis, C37;
Mary Jane Beachler, C38; Betty Mc-
Conaghey, Ed37; Helen Snyder, Ed37;
and Mary Louise Dowling, Ed37.

English Course
Lures Graduate
Across Continent

Although consistent University reg-
istration ﬁgures show a 95 per cent
predominance of enrollment here from
Pittsburgh, Allegheny County and
Western Pennsylvania, it’s still not at
all unusual to ﬁnd students here from
quite far places.

But Muriel McClanahan, G, tells a
striking story. Graduated from Col-
orado College way out west in June,
she was told by a member of her Col-
lege faculty to do nothing until she’d
taken at least one course from Mr.
Percival Hunt, professor and head of
the department of English here.

Miss McClanahan made the journey
from the Rockies with an anthology of
Bret Harte and a yen for some Eng-
lish from Professor Hunt and other
members of the University’s famous
English department faculty. She is
now taking Mr. Hunt's Shakespeare
and Description and Narration
courses, Mr. Frederick P. Mayer's
Modern Novel course, Mr. George
Carver’s course in seventeenth cen-
tury literature, and Miss Ellen M.
Geyer’s survey course in English
literature.

She is studying for her masters de-
gree.—C. B. H.

Transradio News
Head To Discuss
Press Problems

Convention May Extend Three
Days; Holstein Names New
Committee For Dance

Governor George H. Earle will visit
the campus the week-end of Novem-
ber 15 as a speaker for the annual fall
convention of the Intercollegiate News-
paper Association. Ellis H. Tumpson,
BA36, president of the Association,
received a letter from the Governor
Friday, stating his decision to attend
the convention.

Among the other speakers sched-
uled to speak are Herbert Moore,
president of the Transradio Press
Service, who will discuss the press-
radio situation, and Robert X.MGraham,
instructor in journalism here, who
will lead a discussion on some phase
of editorial work on college papers.
A number of prominent local news-
paper and advertising men will also
address the group in separate busi-
ness an.d editorial sessions.

The convention will have its quar-
ters in the Hotel Schenley, where all
of the sessions will be held. And the
INA dance will be held there on the
closing night of the convention. A
date bureau, co-chairmaned by Helen
Rose Gibson, C36, and Virginia Sepp,
Ed35, is assembling a list of eligible
men and women to accompany con-
vention delegates.

The dance chairman, Charles B. Hol-
stein, C36, has appointed the business
manager and staff for the affair. Harry
Robinson. C36. business manager, will
handle the sale of tickets to non-
delegates. The newly appointed com-
mittee includes: Al Dixon, E36; Ruth
Nickel, C37; Edwin Beachler, C37;
Jean Barnes, C38; Russell Connolly,
C36; Anne June Elmer, C36; Gene

.Bu-rkliaizt, ..C36;..-Chanlotte . Atwell, C37 ;

Harvey Goldstein, C37; and Ben Bas-
kin, C37.

A poll is being taken this week
among the member papers of INA to
determine whether the convention will
start a day earlier. Due to the num-
ber and variety of prominent local
men available who are excellent
speakers on press subjects, Tumpson
feels the convention would be of
much greater value if the local com-
mittee, headed by P. Bernard Flem-
ing, C36, could have additional
sessions in which to present them.

Rehearsals Riegin
For ‘Show-Off"

First Players’ Production Termedi
“Best Comedy By American"

_ Rehearsals for “The Show—Off,” Pitt
Players ﬁrst production of the season,
have begun in earnest. Four practice
sessions were held last week. The
play is scheduled for presentation No-
vember 13 or 14.

“The Show-Off,” by George Kelly,
is a comedy that departs from the con-
ventional standards. It has been styled
by Heywood Broun, newspaper writer
and critic, as the “best comedy which
has yet been written by an Ameri-
can.”

The plot concerns a family of or-
dinary means which is more or less
disrupted by the marriage of the
youngest daughter to a Pennsylvania
Railroad clerk of the “wiseacre”
variety. The complications which set
in when he becomes “one of the fam-
ily” are the chief source of amuse-
ment. Things work out in the end,
however, as Aubrey becomes not dif-
ferent, but “tolerable.”

Carl B. Cass, faculty a.dviser to Pitt
Players, is directing. He is being as-
sisted by Charles Foreman, C35.

The name of Audrey Graham, C37,
who will play the part of Clara, was
omitted from previous listings of the
cast.

District Attorney Park

District Attorney Andrew T. Park
will be the main speaker of the eve-
ning when the Pitt Business Institute
Buzzer convenes on Thursday, Octo-
ber 24.

Another feature, in addition to Dis-
trict Attorney Park’s speech, will be

dent of the Ketchum Advertising
Agency.

The meeting will take place in Room
1309, Cathedral. Members of the fac-
ulty will' attend.

Refreshments will be served. Mem-
bership cards for the Institute will
also be available.

Membership in the Institute is lim-
ited to students in the School of Busi-
ness Administration. Its president is
Flmer Schriber, BA37, and Carl F..
Distlehorst, instructor in accounting,
is faculty adviser.

To Go Or Not To Go

OME PHILOSOPHER ONCE SAID, “Silence
is. golden.” The gentleman may have been
entirely right, but the silence week begun yes-.

terday is anything but golden for many freshman
men. .

\Vearied by a continuous round of entertainment
and pep talks, the freshman rushees are lying
awake inbed, gazing into far off space while pro-
fessors discuss Englishtliemes, riding street cars
past their stops, and in general acting like fellows
with a great problem on their minds. _ T

The case for the fraternities has been stated
thoroughly and vigorously during the past. ten
days. To attempt to add any arguments to those
the members have been able to present would be
almost as foolish as it would be superﬂuous.

There can be a few statements made concerning
the disadva.ntages of joining a fraternity. Several
cases have come up in recent years where a frater-
nity has hindered a. man because there were several
of exceptional ability in his society and the frater-
nity could not betray the proportion of honors
sometimes devised by various groups of fraterni-
ties. Other cases have been noted, despite the _ef-
forts of the fraternities, where the idea of lolling
at the “house” has gone to a boy ’s head a lot more
than have his geometry theorems or his chemistry
formulas.

These things should be considered in the rushee’s
decisions, along with the advice that the fraterni-
ties have offered. If the ﬁnancial strain is going
to be too great, it will be better for the boy and for
the fraternity if he holds off. The Greekmen will
agree on that point.

The choice lies with each individual. He can
succeed with a fraternity behind him, he can sue-
ceed without a fraternity’s help. Above all, he
should remember in making his decision that he
must have no fears that his choice will cause mem-
bers of another fraternity to bear a grudge against
him. He will ﬁnd that among such groups the
power to do him harm in the next four years
doesn’t amount to a hill of beans.

A bit of- impartial advice we can offer is that
there are 59 more shopping days until Christmas.

 

A Showdown On Customs

US'l.‘OMS TESTS FOR FRESHMAN men begin
C tomorrow. It is the ﬁrst time in several years
_ that freshman men have been taking customs
tests. The freshmen are to be congratulated upon
their good fortune.

The program of orientation which they are now
undergoing is painless, lively, and proﬁtable.
Things they are learning, and will continue to
learn, give them a start on campus life that has
not been enjoyed the same by a freshman class for
some time. _ .

The tests will not be difficult. Freshmen should
ﬁnd themselves honestly prepared to answer all the
questions wi_thout any trouble. And it might be
wise to note that there are six “e’s” in “Alle-
gen.ee—gena.c-geiiac. ”

Dr. Teagarden,

Address Educational Group

World PossessesIntelligence
But Not Enough Maturity
To Prevent War

“There is intelligence enough in the
world to prevent an Ethiopian war,”

Dr. Florence M. Teagarden last Wed-
nesday told a
group of" educators
attending the ﬁrst-
day session of the
annual Education
-Congress in Har-
risburg_

“There is also in-
telligence enough
in these United
States to balance
the national bud-
get, to distribute
our wealth more
equably, to remove
the look of unhap-
piness -from the
faces one sees in
the streets and to
reduce our insane
population,”- Dr. Teagarden added
. . “There is intelligence enough,
but there is not emotional maturity
and integrity enough to do it.” _

She urged that children be trained
Into different ways of thinking and
new designs for living.

Speaking on “Current Trends in
Primary Education. from a. Psycholog-
ist’s Point of View,” Dr. Teagarden
asserted: -

“Society has been plodding along
dominated by a proﬁt-motive and psy-
chologists allow children to go through
school without learning what other
satisfactions life has aside from
proﬁt. ,

- “Incidentally, society in this country
will probably continue to conduct its
affairs on a. proﬁt-motive, until .the
psychologists, philosophers and teach-
ers get busy and decide that it must
be stopped. When a sufficient de-
termined eﬂort is made to train our
children into a different way of think-
ing and to give them a new design for
living, social and economic changes
may be expected.”

Dr. Teagarden also advocated ade-
quate‘ standards of teacher selection
and practical courses of teacher train-
ing. She considered it not unreason-
able to suppose that a woman happily
married would make a better teacher
than she was before her marriage.

Dean Prall

Young High School Staﬂs,
Better Teaching Urged

Before Congress

Dr. Charles E. Prall, dean of the
School of Education, advocated the em-
ployment of young teachers and ad-
ministrators for high school positions
Thursday at the second-day session of
the Educational Congress.

Speaking to about 100 educators, Dr.
Prall asserted:

“Because the oldsters among us
have almost wholly lost their ability
to prescribe for the immature, it would
seem wise to recommend that high
school pupils be surrounded by a bar-
rier of young teachers and administra-
tors. The contributions of frontier
thinkers, always intent upon society
and its ills, will have to be revised and
amended by those who have kept in
more continuous touch with the young-
sters.”

Pointing out that there is a “univer-
sal tendency for all worthwhile sub-
ject matter to get out of touch with
life,” the dean scored “mechanical
teaching” from standardized and stere-
otyped textbooks. He said:

“After our modern subjects were in-
troduced into the school curriculum,
there were standardized a-nd stereo-
typed textbooks for mechanical teach-
ing. Teachers with little experience
in either the utilitarian affairs of the
world or in a high type of intellectual
living were employed simply -to teach
the textbooks. This was the purpose
of their employment; it became the
purpose of actuating their labor. ,

Recalling, however, that “many at-
tacks have-been made upon mechanical
subject teaching and that it has per-
sisted in spite of the attacks,” Dr.
Prall concluded that “for the best de-
velopment of secondary education the
high school pupil has not been too

dumb, but too gifted.” . .

Glee Club Alumni
Announce Plans

Group Schedules Annual Banquet,
Other Projects On Program

Tentative plans of the newly-formed
Alumni Men’s Glee Club were an-
nounced in letters to more than 400

alumni last week by Robert K. Mc-
Connell, Ed35, secretary-treasurer of
the organization.

These plans include greater repre-
sentation of alumni at the annual un-
dergraduate home concert, organiza-
tion of a singing group, assistance to
the active club in obtaining concerts,
and an annual banquet.

The alumni club was organized last
June to bring about a closer harmony
between graduate and active members.
The oldest non-athletic activity on
the campus, the Men’s Glee Club was
organized in 1890 by John L. High, a
graduate of Amherst and the Univer-
sity Law School, '97, and has been
in existence ever since.

Nearly a thousand men have grad-
uated from the University who have
actively. participated in the Men’s
Glee Club during their undergraduate
days, and of these about 250 live in
the Pittsburgh district today. This
approximate ﬁgure was compiled by
the ofﬁcers of the alumni association,
headed by Adolph G. Anderson, C35,
president. Harry D. Abele, Ed35, is
the. present vice president.

Dr. Walter H. Wright, associate pro-
fessor of the School of Dentistry, has
been director of the active club. since
1927. Harry Robinson, C36, is the
active president.

Pitt Attack Picks
Up Power To Top
West Virginians

 

La.Rue Scores Two Touchdowns;
Barna, Star Mountaineer End,
Spoils Panther Record

 

A determined band of West Vir-
ginia Mountaineers couldn't quite get
their sights adjusted on a couple of
slick Panthers named LaRue.and Pat-
rick Saturday and these two romped
through the Mountaineers’ backyard
to count 24 points and give Pitt its
third victory of the season.

The Mountaineers spread plenty of
buckshot, in the form of forward
passes, over the battle scene. One of
these shots connected for a touch-
down, marking the ﬁrst time this year
that an opponent has found the way
across the Panther goal. The ﬁnal
score stood 24-6.

Hfub Randour, who played his best
game of the season, started the Pan-
ther rush by grabbing a West Virginia
pass and carrying it back to the
Mountaineer 39. Pitt gained a ﬁrst
down and then Randour dropped back
to toss a pass to Bobby LaRue. La-
Rue took the ball. right out of the
hands of a West Virginian and
scampered unmolested across the goal.
Patrick kicked the extra point.

After one of four Pitt penalties for
holding, West Virginia had possession
of the ball on the-Panther 40 early in
the second quarter. -Moan, whose arm
must have been sore from tossing so
many passes, rang the bell on one to
Barna, -who outran the Pitt secondary
to score standing up. The try -for
point failed. . ’

Five minutes . later the Panthers
pulled a fake spinner which sent La-
Rue racing around end while the
Mountaineers tackled everyone but
the referee and LaRue. Bobby went
40 yards all alone on this one. Pat-
rick again kicked the point.

Early in the second half Sites stop-
ped Gocke on a punt formation mis-
play, giving Pitt the ball on the losers’
20. Three plays later Patrick booted
a perfect placement goal from the
ﬁeld.

The ﬁnal Pitt score came when
Glassford covered a Mountaineer fum-
ble on the visitors’ two-yard line._ Pat-
rick plunged across for the touchdown
and kicked the extra point.

Yearlings Lose Tough
~ Battle To Plebes, 3-0

Led by Jack “Whitey” Lee, ﬂashy
fullback from Ellsworth, the Tech

 

T Plebes won a hard-fought 3-0 game

from the Little Panthers at the Tech
Bowl Saturday morning. Both teams
played a defensive game due to the
muddy condition of the ﬁeld. I

The game was a punting duel until
late in the second quarter, when Tech
recovered a. Pitt fumble on the Little
Panther 32-yard line. Then on a pass,
Tech took the ball down to the 15-.
yard line. After trying the line twice
for no gain, Jack Lee went back to
the 20-yard line and booted a ﬁeld
goal. .

In the second half, Coach Milligan’s
proteges threatened to score twice,
but a fumble on the 17-yard line end-
ed one, and an intercepted pass on
the 12-yard line prevented another
chance.

F ilson Wins Panther Ran;

Kappa Sigma Leads Greeks

Pitt's freshman harrier team and
Kappa Sigma whipped both the slip-
pery campus climb and the rest of
the ﬁe1d_in the ﬁrst Panther Run,
Friday, in spite of a heavy downpour
that threatened to spoil this opening
Intramural event.

Filson, ace of the little Panther
squad, led Rauck, Kappa Sigma, by
a step at the ﬁnish on the Alumni
Hall ramp. The winner scampered
over the short uphill course in the
fast time of 3:51 minutes.

Kappasigma, with a net low of 34
points, ra.n away with the lnterfrater-
nity championship toga. However, it
was the old story of conditioning that
triumphed in the individual places.
Filson grabbed off the ﬁrst-place gold
medal, with Rauck receiving the run-
ner-up silver trophy, and Cogswell, of
the Frosh harriers, completing the in-
dividual prize-winners in third posi-
tion.

The race, scheduled to start at 4
o’clock, got underway half an hour
late, due to an exceptionally heavy
downpour at that time. However, dur-
ing a slight drizzling, Starter Carl
Olson, varsity track coach, pulled the
trigger, to open a rather wet.Panther
Run at the start on the corner of
Fifth Avenue and Bigelow.

Pfaff shot. ahead, closely followed
by Filson, Groat, Bonarati and Tred-
ennick. Cogswell and McMunn_ stepped
out at the turn left on O’Hara Street.
At Thaw Hall the race was between
Filson, Rauck, -Cogswell, Tredennick
and Bonarati. On the steep, cobble-
stoned ascent of De Sota street, this
same ﬁve paced the ﬁeld. ,

Leaving the streets for the path at
the Y Hut, Filson paced Rauck by
two _short s_trides. Entering Alumni
Drive and leading down to the Alumni
ramp, Filson crossed the line a scant
stride ahead of Rauck. .

Some 35 spectators shivered in the
cold and rain at the ﬁnishing, as Cogs-
well, Tredennick and Bonarati, all of
the freshman team, placed third,
fourth and ﬁfth. Beachler, Kappa Sig-
ma, ﬁnished sixth, followed by Pfaff,
Kappa Sig, seventh, Murray, freshman,
eighth, and Shields and . M. Groat,
both Kappa Sigma, rounding out the
ﬁrst ten.

Kappa Sigma will receive the bronze
cup, emblematic of Greek cross-coun-
try supremacy, within the next week,
according to Martin J. Feely, director
of Intramural athletics and originator
of this affair. He also states that this
will be an annual affair on the Intra-
mural program.

Touch football, the second event for
both Intramural and Interfraternity
athletes, opens tomorrow. Schedules
will arrive today for competition in
the Greek division. There are still
several openings for teams in the
Independent, Medical, Dental and En-
gineering leagues.

The Intramural play will not open
until VVednesday or Thursday, depend-
ing on the applications for team mem-
bership. These may be secured either
in the Trees Gymnasium oﬁice or
Room 801, Cathedral.

University enthusiasts handed, in en-
try blanks for the second annual Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh fall tennis tour-
nament, which will start on Wednes-

manager, who is taking charge of tour-
nament_ arrangements.

Dr. David O’Loughlin wishes to
stress the fact that this tournament is
open_ to all undergraduate men, both
freshmen and upperclassmen. It is
largely .through the -results of this fall
net event that he determines the mem-
bers of his next year’s varsity and ﬁrst
year teams. Already 16 men who have
earned neither numerals nor a letter
have ,sent- in entry blanks.

,_The»lettermen who entered on Fri-
day were: Joe Madden, James Thomp-
son, Roy Heckler, and Roland Wilson.
John Mogan, Tom Locke and Richard
Conti are the members of last year’s
‘fresh team who have entered. Robert
Madden and Ralph Bald, ranking play-
ers of the 1935 varsity and freshman
teams, respectively, will enter when
they return from White Sulphur
Springs, Virginia. Madden won the
event last year, beating Bald in the
ﬁnals.

 

Lindberg To Try
Out New Theory
As F rosh Coach

Captain Russell Lindberg, who was
recently appointed Coach of the fresh-
man swimming team by Patrick J.
Corr. varsity coach, is determined to
try, one of his pet theories on his
charges. Being convinced of the
value of the diaphragm to the swim-
mer (the diaphragm is an important
muscle used in respiration usually
found just below the lowest bone of
the chest) Russ is scouting around for
a book on voice culture.

Lindberg says’ that the diaphragm
is also very important in singing and
that any good music book is sure to
contain a chapter of voice exercises
calculated to a develop this muscle.
According to “Lindy” the regular
daily practice will now include a pre-
liminary running over -the chords just
to keep the old diaphragm muscles
working.

Corr has long been an advocate of
the well-developed diaphragm as an
important part of the body of a good
swimmer. In fact, when Pat is look-
ing over a new squad of swimmers.
instead of havivngthem stick out their
tongues-and say “ah,” as Dr. Carlson
might, he says, “All right boys, take
a deep breath now and blow out your

[Bob Madden Gets

Another Trophy

Defeats Ramsey Potts, 1-6, 8-6, 6-4,
To Win Collegiate Net Event

 

 

Another coveted cup was added to
the Madden trophy collection when
Bob returned from White Sulphur
Springs, West Virginia, with the Mid-
dle Atlantic Intercollegiate Tennis
championship to his credit.

In a"stubbornly fought match, Mad-
den, after dropping the ﬁrst set, staged
a sensational rally to conquer Ramsay
Potts,_ high ranking performer from
the University of North Carolina, 1-6,
8-6, 6-4, in the ﬁnal round.

In his titleward march, Madden
stepped through a formidable list of
opposition with remarkable ease, win-
ning about every match in straight
sets by decisive scores. The only ex-
ception to this was a three-set match
he had with the seeded No. 2 player,
Frank Shore, in the second round.

Heading the list of Pitt courtmen,
Madden ranks ninth nationally in the
junior men's seed-ing_s, and his most
recent win should move him up sev-
eral notches in the national stand-
ings.

Madden’s quest for another title was
thwarted by a veteran of manytennis
wars, Eddie Feibleman, of New York,
in the annual Greenbriar invitation
event, after a closely contested three-
set match. ~ »

In the intercollegiate doubles play
Madden and Bald defeated Potts and
Shore, 7-5, default, to win another title
for Pitt.

This victory enabled the Pittsburgh
representatives -.to bring home. the
solid Asilver-Greenbriar bowl on which
Southern schools, have had a monop-
oly since the inception ofthese -annual
affairs. This marks the ﬁrst time that
anorthern school has won ﬁrst honors.

Willie Davies Now Answers

Class Bells, Spars With Texts

 

Pardon us, Mr. Jack Schricker, but
we’ve uncovered something that you

might like to hear about in connection
with your boxing team.

We understand, Mr. Schricker, that
you are interested in getting some

very capable boxers on the squad. Now
how wouldyou like us to tell you
about a rather light fellow who we’ll
wager can knock any of the boxers
you have now loose from their under-
pinnings? Would you be able to use
a fellow like this against Temple or
West Virginia?

Now before you start reaching for
your hat and coat, M_r. Schricker, we
had better stick a pin in the balloon.
Thefellow we’re thinking about is
Willie Davies, enrolled as a freshman
in the School of Education, and of
course you know about him. Now
we’ll look away if you care to shed a
tear. that you can’t use Willie.

6 When he won decisions in non-title

bouts over Frankie Genaro and Izzy
Schwartz, who were then._ the ﬂy-
weight champions’ of the world, Da-
vieswas recognized as the unofﬁcial
champion. _ .

Willie had a_ background that was
ideal for the development of a later
champion. His father _had made box-
ing a hobby in his younger days and
Willie always found a pair of boxing
gloveshandy about the Davies’ home
in Roscoe, Penna. At an early age he
gave novel boxing exhibitions in
which one of his sisters was his
sparring partner. .

A, few. years later, when, he had
not yet reached the age of sixteen, he
determined. to make boxing his career
and. became an amateur, boxer. Be-
cause he weighed a hundred pounds,
the determined young battler couldn't
get many ﬁghts. He had to enter
amateur tournaments in the 112-pound

class, although he was continually
from ﬁve to eight pounds underweight.

He had won tournament after tour-

nament as an amateur and was slated
to compete in the 1924 Olympics, but
when the eligibility committee did not
give their approval because of natural-
ization difﬁculties. he immediately
turned professional.

.Davies’ rise as a professional was
rapid, and one of the greatest careers
of any district boxer reached its peak
in the battles with Genaro and
Schwartz. However. when he was
asked whether these battles consti-
tuted the biggest thrills of his career
Davies said, “No.” and went on to
tell the ﬁght that had been most grat-
ifying to him.

“It was in my ﬁght with ‘Newsboy’
Brown, when I was just coming up,
that I got my biggest thrill,” he re-
called. “The ‘Newsboy’ had badly
beaten Fidel La Barba, who was the
champ then, and the packed house at
Motor Square Garden knew only one
thing, and that was that Brown was
going to knock Davies from pillar to
post. Davies was the only one who
didn’t, know that and Brown hasn't
hit Davies yet.”

, And now, with 287 ﬁghts—of which
he lost only 24——and 10 years of ﬁght-
ing behind him, having become a
husband and the father of a young
son, Davies has enrolled in. the Uni-
versity. Surely he had some deﬁnite
aim in mind when he entered? Yes,
he did. He has already aided three
sisters through school and now he
was going to help himself to an ed-
ucation. , ,

It is just two years since he en-
teredhigh school and four years from
now he hopes to receive his diploma
as a Physical Education major. In
the meantime he will help Coach
Schricker with the Pitt boxing team.

started one Saturday night

) HERE’S no use talking-——Satu'rday was an ex-
citing day for Amos Hunter. (You know him-
the nice young fellow with the pink cheeks.) That
night he had a date with a girl. THE date with

THE girl.

.So he spent part of the afternoon shining up the
old bus with “Duco” Polish. By supper time it was
new-looking and handsome enough for a king

and queen.

In the meantime Susie Blossom was busy with
her needle, putting the last frills and furbelows on
her new, peach-colored Du Pont Rayon dress.

Susie was pretty sure that Amos was THE boy.

And at eight o_’c_lock sharp, Amos and Susie
were on their way in the bright, shiny car . . .

. . . bound for the movies to see a hand-holding
romance that was made on Du Pont ﬁlm.

Neither Amos nor Susie realized how chemical
research had touched their lives that day. The
shiny car, the rayon dress, and the movie ﬁlm-
all resulted from the work of chemists. As a matter
of fact, no day passes that modern chemistry
doesn’t help make life happier and more complete

for them—and for you.

Who Cares If Several Suits
So Scarcely Suited Suitors?

Memories Of Hats, Prizes,

Punch Linger With Coeds;

Fathers, Brothers, Uncles Recover Clothes

By Jean Barnes

There was a grand march.

There were lots of people.

There were prizes for paper hats.

And there were paper hats. -

So might a freshman woman answer
if you up and asked her what was
what about the Coed Prom that WAA
gave last Wednesday night. But that
wouldn’t be all.

She might have commented on the
heat, and she might—if she were
thinking of her new and ruined slip-
pers'——even have said that these up-
perclass women weren’t so hot at lead-
ing.

But she most certainly would have
added it was swell, in deﬁance of all
laws of good grammar. For that
seemed to be the consensus in the
class of ’39.

They enjoyed every bit of it, said
those questioned. They liked the
punch. They liked the idea of dates
with women for a change. They even
liked—some of them—dancing with
those women, although one sweet miss
said, “It must have been the big
crowd, but I’ve never been bumped
so much in all my life.”

And one, a senior mentor’s sister,
said she wished they’d let her dress
up like ’a man, it looked like so much
fun. She didn’t know the half of it.

She didn’t know how her dance part-
ners worried about big brother’s pants
and drank punch carefully, with an
eye to not spilling. She didn’t know

‘how many pairs of trousers were

pinned up, so they wouldn’t give the
effect of a train. And she didn’t know
how hot it was inside those coats.

All Frances the Freshman saw was
the outer, the happy, side of things.
She saw, for instance. Kit Hall doing
a song number in a. black and white
outﬁt that looked made for her. The
white ﬂannel coat with a black bow
tie, that came up close to the throat.
and did away with the need of a shirt
underneath, was one to suit with a
skirt that Kit wears to school.

And she may——this senior of ’39—-
have thought that Ruth Rosenthal
looked very smooth in her dark-blue

suit, but she didn’t know that Ruth
borrowed it from a little boy who had
only the one outﬁt, so that he had to
stay home in bed while Ruth dis-
ported.

But 011 the whole, even the gal in
trousers had a fairly decent time of
it. There was Alice Meisel, C36, in
a sailor outﬁt, and Kitty Bashline,
C37, in a soldier’s uniform, and Sarah
Brunson, C38, in a two-tone number;
two-tone, said Sarah, because it was
obtained from different places.

Then there was Lois Rex, Ed36,
who swung around the ﬂoor in full
regalia, white tie and tails, while
Thyrsa Agnes Amos, C37, among some
few others, wore a tux.

Thyrsa said of it, “I don’t mind a
tux, but I wish the shirt would stay
put.”

Anne June Elmer, C36, voiced most
upperclass-women’s opinions when
she claimed, “It was the nicest one
I’ve ever been to, especially in regard
to the hats. They were the best ever.”

Which should make everyone, but
particularly Betty Boman, C39, and
Lucille Upegraff, C39, very happy in-
deed, for they won the prizes for their
hats, Betty with a large one, and
Lucille with a small one. These two
girls will carry new evening bags on
their next date as the result of their
work with paper and glue.

The comments on the program were
varied. Those who entertained the
crowd were Beverly Childress, C38,
who did an Armenian Bell dance with
bells on her wrists; Jane Booth, Ed37,
and Loretta McElwee, Ed36, who did a
dance number in the Veloz and Y0-
landa style; June Greene, C38, who
stepped out with a gypsy number;
Kit Hall, who sang songs through a
megaphone in the best Vallee man-
ner. a.nd Mary Jo Kunkle, Ed37, in a
bathing costume of the gay ’90’s.

Yes, it was a nice dance. It was
fun in spite of the crowd at the
check room, where the harassed man-
ager did his best to match un-match-
ing coats and checks. It was fun in
spite of the wilted collars and stepped-
on feet, and elbows in your ribs.

But if you happen to know where
the little 39-er is who thought it was
so much fun. to pulliout the men's
ties, will you please send her around?

Will Meet Today

Technique Problems To Confront
Members During First Class

The Women’s Debating Association
schedule of. classes and meetings for
the year begins today with a ﬁfth
hour class on problems in debate tech-
nique in Room 109, Alumni Hall. The
class, which will be taught by Marie
Hockmuth, newly appointed assistant
debating coach, will be a regular Mon-
day feature hereafter and will be open
to all members of the Association.

During the seventh hour today, in
the same room, another series of
meetings will be started at which the
group will hold general discussions on
socialized medicine, the subject se-
lected for the year’s extension de-
bates.

A second run of discussion meet-
ings will ta.ke place the sixth hour
on Tuesdays in Room 109, Alumni
Hall, and another class in Room 320,
getting under way the ﬁfth hour on
VVednesday. At the Wednesday classes
Miss Theresa Kahn, women’s debat-
ing coach, will speak on how to make
debating effective.

All members of the Association are
required to attend one of the weekly
discussion meetings and may attend
either or both of the classes in de-
bate technique.

A preliminary threshing out of the
socialized medicine question took
place at the Association’s ﬁrst meet-
ing last Thursday, when Dr. Sylvia
Wechsler presented a number of the
reasons why physicians oppose a so-
cialized medicine program.

Chief among.Dr. Wechsler’s objec-
tions was the claim that physician-
patient relationship, which the doctor
ﬁnds so necessary if he is to cure his
patients mentally as well as physic-
ally, might be impaired.
