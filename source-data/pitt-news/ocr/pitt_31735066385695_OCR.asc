Environmental concerns at Pitt reﬂect national trend

By Jessica Coville
Asst. Managing Editor

The majority of American college
students, much maligned as materialistic,
socially unconcerned and ideologically
disconnected, are, in fact, intensely
concerned about environmental quality,
according to a National Wildlife Federation
survey which was recently released.

Sixty percent of the students surveyed in
50 colleges and universities around the
country expressed individual concern for
the environment, and an equal number
also believe that conditions will worsen
within the next five years.

Although the University of Pittsburgh
did not participate in the survey, its city
location does prompt a greater awareness
of problems such as pollution and
recycling.

“Pitt students seem pretty concerned
and are willing to help out,” said Kelli
Stevens, a founding member of Pitt’s
environmental group Concerned Leaders
for Environmental Action Now which is
responsible for recycling containers located

around the campus. The group started this
year in an effort to make the University of
Pittsburgh more conscientious about its
involvement with environmental concerns.

T wenty—three percent of students
responded that air pollution was the most
urgent problem to be addressed. On the
home front, Stevens said that Pitt’s
“incredible paper waste” was an issue that
needed to be addressed.

With a 96-percent recognizability, the
most familiar issue to college students, is
the oil spills which occur globally. Smog
and acid rain followed, while the loss of
the wetlands was the most unfamiliar to
the students.

Sixty percent of college students do not
think of private industry as having the sole
responsibility for protecting the
environment; rather, they feel that all
citizens in general and the government
hold primary responsibility.

Stevens said that CLEAN will be involved
in preparations for Earth Day on April 22,
a day which will be devoted to greater
environmental awareness locally and
globally.

Abortion among main issues for student activists

By Sandy Paul
For The Pitt News

Student activism is increasing
on college campuses throughout
the country, and the University of
Pittsburgh is no exception.

A recent survey conducted by
the American Council on
Education and the University of
California at Los Angeles’ Higher
Education Research Institute
addressed the attitudes of
incoming college freshmen on
several controversial issues. The
results revealed that students tend
to lean toward liberal views on

abortion and concern for the
environment.

At Pitt, activism in these two
areas paralleled the survey results
when looked at in terms of group
membership and solidarity.

Mary Harnler, adviser for the
mostly pro-choice Campus
Women’s Organization, said, “I’d
say our membership has doubled
since last year.” About 80 women
are actively involved with the
group that was started in 1986 in
response to the need for a feminist
organization on campus.

Although being a pro-choice
advocate is not a criterion for

Birthplace oﬂers option
for expectant mothers

By Jacinta Marie Dvorak
Staff Writer

For expectant mothers who ﬁnd the birthing techniques used in
hospitals somewhat impersonal, Birthplace in Shadyside offers an
atmosphere a bit more intimate and close to home.

:‘Birthplace isn’t a hospital,” said Karen Knudson, coordinator of

-midwifery services. “It offers patients a great deal more ﬂexibility."
Birthplace was started 12 years ago, when childbirth educators got
together and brainstormed the idea of an alternative to a regular

hospital delivery.

“The hospital uses language of illness. Hospitals have a way of
making women feel ill  not pregnant,” Knudson said. The primary
care is given by nurse midwives. What makes Birthplace special is its
staff and its method of dealing with delivery.

Before the actual delivery, there is a great deal of prenatal care
given to the woman. “There are office visits before the woman
actually goes into labor. We require that all of the patients have some
type of prenatal education. It reduces the stress of labor,” Knudson

said.

Birthplace uses the method of natural childbirth and is affiliated
with West Penn Hospital. if any complications arise during the

membership, President Debbie
Gould said, “I think it is one of
the things that has increased
general interest in women’s issues,
and in turn, has had some effect
on our group membership.”

In contradiction to the survey,
however, more conservative
views on abortion are shared by
a significant number of Pitt
students. About 40 people are
involved in Students for Life, a
pro—life activist group.

The study also showed an
increase in student concern for
the environment. At Pitt, this
interest in the environment has

been a very recent one.

With the 1988 Pennsylvania
mandatory-recycling law, efforts
to launch an environmental-
awareness group on Pitt’s campus

began. AS of Jan. 1, 1990, and CWO are heavily involved in

Spring breakers find exotic resorts better than Daytona

Staff Writer

Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I want to

Some Pitt students sung this

Beach Boys hit during their spring
break ’90 while sunning on the
beaches of such exotic places.

Daytona wasn’t the only
destination for students to catch
fun in the sun. The Bahamas and
Cancun were also hot spots.
Students ventured out of the
country to experience a different
culture and to relax in paradise.

Juniorjim Vaughn said, “I heard
that the Bahamas were incredible,
and they are. Daytona always
sounded crowded and I didn’t
want to be there like a million
other people.”

According to Vaughn, he and
six of his friends made their plans

leaving from Philadelphia. He
said they were disappointed with
their accommodations, a small
room with four bunk beds.

“Even if I had to ﬂy out of Philly
again, I’d go. When we arrived,
we went to the beach at S a.m. to
watch the sun come up.” Vaughn
added, “Once we got to the beach,
everyone’s mood swung.”

Vaughn said he enjoyed the
night life very much.

“Club Waterloo was awesome.
There are no alcohol laws
basically. You can drink in the
cab, on the beach and on the
street. No one really cares,” said
Vaughn.

Vaughn summed up the
atmosphere of the Bahamas as
laid back and mellow, adding
that nothing seemed to matter
there, and he experienced no
problems.

“The water was incredible —
clear and calm. Way out it was
true blue where you could almost
see the bottom,” Vaughn said.

Senior Frank Natale agreed.

“I’ve been there twice, and I’d
go back 15 more times.”

“It was the most incredible
week of my life and all I do now
is think of my trip. I sit in class
and daydream about the
Bahamas, and I can’t wait to go
back,” said juniorjoe Capezzuto,
who also ventured to the
Bahamas.

Capezzuto said that his most
fascinating experience in the

. Bahamas was snorkeling.

“Seeing yellow, purple and blue
fish was incredible. We even saw
a sting ray,’ and I was paranoid
that it was going to turn around
and come after us,” said
Capezzuto.

Another interesting fact was
that half of the guys and all of the
girls had their hair braided in
some way, said Capezzuto.

Vaughn said, “Money goes like
water in the Bahamas. It is very

Capezzuto and Vaughn
agreed,”lt was the best week of
[our] lives.”

While some students went to
the east of Florida, others went
west to Cancun.

Juniorjohn Demming decided
to go to Cancun instead of
Daytona because of the poor
Florida weather conditions last
year. He wasn’t disappointed with
the choice.

“The nightclubs such as Hard
Rock Cafe, Carlos and Charlies,
Daddios and La Boom were
incredible. I also loved drinking
beer on the beach,” he said.

“Price—wise I thought it would
be cheaper, but the prices were
average. Whether you would
bargain with a taxi driver or at the
market, they would say 10,000
pesos and you would say 6,000
pesos.”

Demming added that the the

water. The water was so clear.
Snorkeling was so awesome. We
also rode giant turtles.”

Sharon Yoder, a junior, decided
against Daytona because she feels
it is over-publicized.

“Cancun was a change of pace.
It was very interesting to be in
another culture," said Yoder.

Yoder said anyone who knows
a little Spanish will love spring
break in Mexico, but student traps
are still present.

“The college student guys get
ripped off. They might get free
cover, but they don’t get free
drinks. I never had to buy a
drink,” said Yoder.

She added, “All of the waiters
in the local bars in town seemed
to be male waiters and they kiss
you constantly. If a waiter in the
United States would kiss you,
you would say, ‘Oh my God!’ “

Continued from page 1
pregnancy, the patient is
transferred to West Penn. _

“Women have a lot more
options,” Knudson stated. While
waiting to deliver, women have
the option to watch television or
take a walk. . One of the
advantages that Birthplace has to
offer is that the patient is not as
restricted as she would be if she
were in a hospital.

Vicki Weidner, co-owner of A-
K Nautilus, opted for Birthplace’s
unique style of delivery. “You
should know all of your options,”
Weidner said. One of the main
reasons that Weidner chose
Birthplace over a hospital was
the fear of an unnecessary
Caesarean section. “I just hate to
have unnecessary things done.

“The prenatal care is wonderful.
The midwives know what to do,
and they give you support,” said
Weidner. She felt that since the
midwives were female, they
related to the whole birthing
situation better.

“The midwife and her birthing
assistant were there the whole
time. When their shift ended they
didn’t say, ‘See you Vicki ...’ It’s
nice to know that someone will

be there the whole time,” said
Weidner.

Since Birthplace offered much
less formal surroundings, Weidner
was able to relax more. “They
had a Jacuzzi, which was really
nice. Iwas allowed to do anything
for comfort,” she said.

Birthplace allows family
members to be present at the
birth. “It’s such a nice atmosphere.
I invited my and [my husband]
Greg’s family. They were all
watching movies while I was in
labor,” Weidner said.

“We deliver about 120 babies a
year,” said Knudson. “We offer a
great deal more ﬂexibility. Most
of [the] referrals come from other
patients.”

“Afterjake [Weidner] was born,
they didn’t take him away from
me. You'd never get that in a
hospital. We had so much
personal time with Jake. It was
nice. It’s really good care,” said
Weidner.

Birthplace offers gynecological
exams. It also has a newsletter
keeping its patients up to date on
the latest prenatal and birthing
care. Weidner added, “Not a lot
of people know it’s there. I would
recommend it, definitely."

Continued from page 1
issues are things you can control.
Students can [have direct] impact
on the outcomes.”

The hope of impact and change
has prompted student activism in
other areas on Pitt's campus.
Student groups exist for gay rights,
animal rights and help for the

homeless.

Jay Katz, who has helped to
found many student~activist
groups at Pitt, feels that legislation
and the media are the forces
behind student activism. Because
of the exposure, he said, “A lot of
issues are becoming more
mainstream in focus and more
widely accepted."

Abortion groups ‘recycle’
the same old arguments

 

By Jennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer

While pro-life advocates were
passing out literature inside WPU
yesterday, some members of Pitt’s
Common Ground Coalition were
busy outside the building.

“When people came outside
with those leaﬂets in their hands
we asked them if they were going
to keep them. We are collecting
them and then we are going to
recycle the paper. We want to
put that garbage to some good
use, ” said Lisa Oshop, member of
the Campus Women’s
Organization .

“We were very angry at the
things that they were saying. To
be blunt- those [leaﬂets] are just
full of lies,” she said.

Along with Oshop, about ten
other prochoice students were
counterdemonstrating by passing
out literature and free condoms.

“This was a counter
demonstration but with a positive
message,” she said, “People’s
reaction to us seemed to be very

 

good?

“Part of the reason I think was

so self righteous and smug.”

Joel Garrett, president of Pitt’s
Students For Life, was part of the
activities inside of the union.
Garrett said that he wasn’t
bothered by the group
demonstrating outside.

“I am glad that they are here
and that they have a right to do
this but I think that we all need to
be calm. There is no need for
bitterness or namecalling," he
said. ‘

PCUC’s project at their ballroom
social on Tuesday. Alicia Hall,
SFL secretary, said that the social
served many purposes for the
group.

“What we were trying to do is
to get people together to inform
them. It is also a focus on the pro-
life community in general,” she
said. ~

Seniors’ response to our student loans
has been overwhelming.

Everyone's head-over-heels about
Pittsburgh National's consolidation
student loans and graduate school

loans.

That's because with a Pittsburgh
National consolidation student loan,
you can cram all your eligible student
loans into one?‘ And, with the Student
Loan Network Consolidation Program,
you can choose the repayment option

school and need financing that won't
cost you an arm and a leg, apply fora
Supplemental Loan for Students (SLS)

from Pittsburgh National. With an SLS

loan, you can defer repayment until
after you leave school. And our current
rate is just ll.7'3%. That's lower than
most other banks.

So, avoid the crush of higher educa-
tion costs after graduation. Beat the

Spring Break 1990

 

Identity crisis...
Underage drinkers find
Daytona sobering experience

By Jennifer Calabrese
Staff Writer

Larry Hergert, bouncer at one
of the hottest clubs on Daytona
Beach, conﬁscated more than 70
I.D.s from underage spring
breakers in three days last week.

“We are strict as hell. I can look
at an I.D. and tell right away
whether or not its fake,” said
Hergert, who has worked for two
years at The Ocean Club.

Whenever Hergert isn’t sure
about an I.D., he consults a small
white book that he calls his bible.
Inside are photos of driver’s
licenses from all 50 states.

“With this book, there’s no
mistaking anything. The pictures
show the actual size of the license,
so that's one of the biggest tip-
offs when an I.D. is the wrong
size. There’s also a close-up of
the state seal, which is what is
messed up on a lot of these
fakes,” Hergert said.

After Hergert confiscates an
I.D., he turns it over to the Liquor
Control Board in Florida.

“If the guy gives me a real rash
of [crap], and he really wants the
card, then I'll give it back to him.
If not, I turn it over to the board,

. but nothing happens to the kid

with the I.D. or to the person
whose I.D. they're using,” he
said.

Hergert said that some students
have gotten out of control after

he took away their cards.

“If people really get nasty,
there’s a cop here always to take
care of them. The cop always has
the ﬁnal say about whether or not
the I.D. is bad," he said.

Andy Bierig, a Pitt sophomore,
had his fake I.D. taken away at
another local club, The Candy
Store.

“The bouncer just looked at my
I.D. really, really carefully and

then he said, ‘[The birth date] is .

typed over the lamination.’ And it
was,” Bierig said.

“When I asked him to give it
back to me, he told me that if I
wanted to, I could go to the cop
and get it back from him. I sure as
hell wasn’t going to try that.”

Cesar Fojas, another Pitt
sophomore, had a similar
experience when he tried to use
a friend’s I.D.

“The guy at the door studied it
for so long, and then he took it

-away. The thing is that it worked
the night before,” he said.

Fojas said that he had some
trouble getting into the Daytona
clubs even before his I.D. was
taken away. _

“The night before at a different
club thatl went to, they asked me
a whole string of questions. They
asked me for my address, my zip
code, my [astrological] sign and
my high-school graduation date.
It was incredible,” he said.

Fojas was able to answer all of

Victory pose?

Not quite for this spring breaker. Best body contests were
among the biggest crowd pleasers at Daytona.

Bouncer Greg Bitz throws a student using an alledged fake I.D. out of the Ocean Club

the questions, but he said he was
still surprised that he got in, since
he thinks that he looks too young.

“Last year at Three Rivers
Stadium, they were giving away
free bats to kids under 12, and
one of the people just came up
and gave me one,” he said.

In Florida, where just two years

- ago the drinking age was changed

from 19 to 21, I.D. requirements
in local stores and supermarkets,

as well as in the night spots, are

especially strict. Many of them
ask for two or three forms of
alternate I.D. with a driver’s
license. When spring breakers
come in to try to purchase alcohol,
the clerks ask for an I.D. everyone
in the group, not just the
purchaser.

Both Bierig and Fojas said that
they were going to continue to
frequent the.clubs despite their
lost I.D.s.

“I figure that even if you enter
as a minor, you still might be able
to find a way to drink once you
get inside,” Bierig said.

Most of the clubs in Daytona
admit people who are under 21
for about $2 or $3 over the regular
cover price. Vicki Doperak, a Pitt
sophomore, said that she has
tried several tricks to try to
purchase liquor after she has
entered a club.

“My friends and I tried the lick-
em and stick-em where you use
the stamp that someone else
already has and try to get the

imprint on your hand, but it didn't

work that well,” she said.

At the Ocean Club, a dual
system of I.D. bracelets and
stamps are used to try to
discourage these types of tricks.

“Most clubs give the underagers
the bracelet, and the kids just
take them off. We give the 21-
year—olds a bracelet and a stamp
and the minors no bracelet and a
different stamp. That way there’s
no way aroundit,” said Greg Bitz,
bouncer at The Ocean Club.

Doperak added a message to
next year’s spring breakers.

“Just one word of advice before
you think about coming down
here: wait until you are 21,
because it sucks here if you are
not,” she said.

The price of

is it that determines the price of
any good or service? In a free
market, prices are generally
determined by supply and de-
mand. The cold weather of last
December increased the demand
for heating oil. The higher de-
mand caused the price to go up.

The pricing mechanism of a
free market acts as a form of
communication. First, the higher
price of oil encourages an in-
crease in production. Secondly,
it tells the consumer that oil must
be conserved. The consumer can
either pay the higher price, re-
duce his oil consumption or seek
out alternative methods for heat-
ing his home.

Of course, what do the words
“free market” really mean? In a
free market, economic transac-
tions are carried out by people
on a voluntary basis. Regardless
of what price an oil company
charges for oil, nobody is forced
to buy it. For example, I can
stand on a street corner and offer
oil for $100 a gallon, but I am not
forcing anybody to buy it. I am
merely making an offer. Like-
wise, the oil companies are
merely offering their product. If
somebody doesn’t like the price,
then he shouldn’t buy it.

Incidentally, I should mention
that in the nation as a whole,
there was no actual shortage of
oil. The supply was enough to
meet the demand. However,
there was difficulty in transport-

pletely justiﬁed port per trip.

a in raising their  This means

What exactly against the

law to use foreign ships to trans-
port oil from one U.S. port to
another. Last December, there
weren't enough U.S. ships to
carry the oil, and foreign ships
could have helped to fill in this
gap. However, because of this
stupid law, those ships were not
allowed to transport the oil to
where it was needed.

In a free society, the govern-
ment shou1dn’t tell people what
they can or can’t do with their

private property. But some of

our lawmakers don't know what
that means. Instead, they opt for
a law that would put somebody
in jail for an action that should
never have been considered a
crime in the first place.

If foreign ships were allowed
to carry the oil, more of it could
have been transported. With a
larger supply available, the price
increase that had resulted from
the cold weather would not have
been as severe. Simply put, the
cold weather raised the price of
oil, but government regulations
made the problem even worse.

So here's what we have: the
government prevents the oil‘
companies from transporting
enough oil to meet the custom-
ers’ demand for it. Then, the very
same government accuses the oil
companies of wrongdoing. If
anything, the accusing should be
in the opposite direction. The
government is guilty of interfer-
ing in the marketplace.

Gays and lesbians in the ROTC...

...a non-discriminatory idea

 unrealistic idea

Contrary to’ the Feb. 22, 1990,
Pitt News editorial and the whin-
ing of the Gay and Lesbian Alli-
ance, the presence of homosexu-
als in the military is not a good
idea.

I am a U.S. Navy veteran and
know firsthand that gays are not
wanted by the men in the serv-
ice. Having a homosexual serve
next to you in the confined spaces
such as a U.S. Navy ship is not a
good way to lift morale and will
do nothing but endanger the
safety of the gay that is serving. I
know this from personal experi-
ence. I have no desire to see
homosexuals physically beaten
or taunted, but yet this would
occur if they are present in the
military. There is a lot of reliance
placed on the feeling of interde-
pendence among the men of
individual units in order to in-
crease. the motivation and effi-
ciency of the military overall.
This would be greatly disrupted
by the presence of gays in large
numbers among servicemen.

Anyway, the needs of the U.S.
military, which defends this na-
tion, homosexual or heterosex-
ual, far outweigh the crying of a
very few gays who try to enter
ROTC. Quite a few ROTC cadets
are on full scholarship from the

1 government to attend here. If

ROTC was forced to leave, then
these students would have to
transfer to differentschools, What
about the rights of these stu-
dents? There. are far more of
them than there are of gays trying
to get into ROTC. These stu-
dents’ lives would be greatly
disrupted. This should be given
more importance than their
nitpicking complaints of a very
few gay ROTC applicants. ROTC

~ has a positive effect on campus

and should not be removed
because of the complaints of the
Gay and Lesbian Alliance. Sorry,
it's time people like the editorial
staff of ThePitt News get a lot less
liberal and a lot more in touch
with reality.

  Letters

Editor's note: the following letter
was signed by 1 7students. S

In response to “ROTC Programs
Discriminate Against Gays And
Lesbians,” we applaud 7he,Pitt
News and Ms. Calabrese for pro-
ducing an unbiased and fine piece
of journalism. Captain Raymond
Horoho and the Pentagon hard-
liners support irrational preju-

dices against gay people and
discrimination.

In January 1989, a study pub-
lished by the Department of
Defense’s Personnel Security and
Research Center criticized the
military’s policy of excluding and
discharging gays and lesbians
from the armed forces. The Center
was commissioned to determine
whether gay men and lesbian
women were security risks. After
determining that gay and lesbian
people were less of a security risk
than heterosexuals, they ad-
dressed the question: “Should
homosexual individuals serve in
the military?” The report recom-
mends that the Pentagon end its
anti-gay policy.

Remember, discrimination

hurts people. Congresswoman
[Patricia] Schroeder is examining
incidents of military sexual har-
assment. When women have
spurned sexual advances by male
officers, they have been accused
of being lesbians (falsely and
correctly), discharged or even
imprisoned before discharge. For

example, Sgt. Cheryl Jameson, .a 

lesbian, rejected sexual advances
made by a maleofﬁcer. Heras_-
sailant accused Sgt. Jamesongof

being a lesbian. When the truth 3

came out about her sexual orien-

tation, ‘she was imprisoned for .

six months before discharge!

Heterosexual women have been I 7,
discharged after being labeled a V

lesbian because the women did

not submit to a male officer’s V

sexual advances. For more infor-
mation, contact the National

Lawyers’ Guild Military Law Task A _

Force in New York.

Despite Capt. Horoho’s objec-
tions, gay and lesbian people
have served, serve and will serve
their country. In the United States,
many lesbian/ gay veterans’
groups exist; for example, there’s
a gay chapter of the American
Legion. Maybe Capt. Horoho and
Pentagon hardliners should learn
not to judge individuals based on
stereonpes or prejudices. Rather
than doing nothing about preju-

dice, maybe Capt. Horohoshould ~

get involved with the struggle for
lesbian/gay/bisexual equality.

‘§‘6\“-‘

The 1989 Pitt offensive line is n
6 up the slack.

Enough is enough.

For 27 days America has had to
sit idly by and watch its favorite
pastime be made a mockery of
by the people who are in charge
at the major- league level. For
almost one month, baseball fans
have had to watch
multimillionaires quibble with
millionaires.

Baseball players’ union chief
has been in a
constant state of bickering with
Chuck O’Connor, the
management’s leader.

Of course, everyone knows
that the chief stumbling block to
getting a’ settlement is salary
arbitration. The owners want
things to return to the way they
were before the last contract was
signed — they want a player to
have three years of se-rvice before
he can be eligible for arbitration.
The players, on the other hand,
seem bent on getting that level
down to two years, where it was
before. Fehr claims that his
soldiers showed great sympathy
with their bosses during the last
negotiations and allowed it to
reach the three—year level.

Baseball- regular-season
openers are almost certain to be
cancelled at this point unless a

_ miraculous agreement is reached _

before this column is printed.

Neither side seems willing to
budge at all, though, so there is
only one thing that can be done
to salvage the baseball season
and, thus, any sense of
respectability that the game has
left.

It is a decision that would take

a lot of guts and could be made
by only one man.

Yes, it is time for Commissioner
Fay Vincent to take control of the
game as only a man with as much
power as he has can. Vincent is
the only man in the world who
can open spring training and,
thus, get the seasonunderway at

 

Ed
Kuznik

least sometime in the next month.

Former Commissioner Bowie
Kuhn did the same thing in a
similar labor dispute in the late
’70s. He showed some guts, and
now it is time for Vincent to show
some courage of his own and
prove that he is a capable leader.

As soon as possible, Vincent
should call Fehr and O’Connor
into his office and order them to
get things back to normal while
negotiations continue. Mr.
O’Connor should be informed
that major-league baseball has
just hired the best locksmith in
the world to pick the locks in

early all gone, -but the 1990 recruiting class should pick

Time for Vincent to take control

spring training and allow the
players to work out.

And Mr. Fehr should be told to
explain to his peons that perhaps
they should work just a tad bit
harder to prepare for the
upcoming regular season. There
are rumors that Fehr has told
them not to work out too much
in these past few weeks for fear
that they will actually be ready to
give the fans a major league
product when the season does
start. J

Of course, the obvious worst-
case scenario to all of this
happening would be that spring
training would open, the season
would start at least sometime
before mid-April and then the
players would collect a few
paychecks and strike in the
middle of the season, thus,
ruining everything for 1990.

However, almost everything
we do in life is a gamble. The
phrase “put up or shut up” is a
good set of words to live by.

Yes, if players do strike, then
Vincent will look like nothing
short of a moron to those who
are uninformed of the entire
situation. Likewise, he will be
depicted as a genius if a contract
is reached before another
stoppage.

But there is really no other
alternative for Vincent. The
arbitration case is not something
that can be negotiated. One side
must give in. There is nothing at
all that can be argued over —
except a ridiculous owner plan,
laughed at by Fehr, which has a

WEDNESDAY, MARCH 14, 1990)

Defensive and offensive lines beefed up by recruits

The Pitt football program ﬁlled some holes on its defensive line’s
depth chart by recruiting Parade All-American Reuben Brown and the
very large Alcindor Coleman (6-feet—5-inches, 295 pounds).

Brown, a 6-4, 270-pound defensive linebacker from Lynchburg,
Va., could step in and start immediately at right defensive tackle, a
position left vacant with the early NFL entry of Marc Spindler.

The 1990 defensive line will also be without last year’s seniors Tony
Siragusa, Carnel Smith and Tom Sims. Jeff Esters, who will be a junior,
may also be out of the Panthers’ lineup for the 1990 season. Esters
punched his right hand through a dormitory window in February,
when he discovered money was stolen from his room. He received
vein and artery damage and may be redshirted if he does not heal by

preseason camp.

Other new additions to the Panther defensive line in 1990 will
include; Arno Askew, Joe Green Jr., and Charles Williams. Askew is
a 6-5, 210—pound end from Aliquippa, Pa. Green (6-4, 225 pounds)
played defensive end at Navarro Junior College. Williams is a 6-3, 240-
pounder from Valley Forge Military Academy in Philadelphia.

Perhaps one of Pitt’s best catches on its recruiting list is wide
receiver Chris Jorfes. Jones was the top-rated high-school receiver in
Florida last year. Jones (6-4, 195 pounds) chose the Panthers over
Florida, Michigan and Michigan State because of Pitt’s’ pass-oriented
offense. Panther quarterback Alex Van Pelt made phone calls toJones

asking him to come to Pitt.

Pitt also recruited numerous offensive linemen and defensive
backs. The offensive line loses seniors Dean Caliguire, Roman
Matutz, Bill Cherpak. and Chris Goetz. The secondary loses Alonzo
Hampton, Dan Crossman and Robert Bradley.

ﬂancbise prostitution.

Class dismissed, and enjoy your
lunch.

When the Raiders made their
jarringly bold move to Los Angeles
following the 1981 season, I made

~ a pact with myself that I would

never call the team the L.A. Raiders
in conversation. In print, well, it
was almost necessary. But when
shooting the breeze, it felt
awkward. It still does, as would
hearing myself say the Des Moines
Dolphins, the San Antonio
Steelers or the Platte Packers.

I can finally quit sleeping upside
down during football season, now
that the Oakland Raiders will be
back in the standings.

But after watching the so—called
renegade owner whore around
his franchise over the past year,
just the very name of Al Davis

may take on a connotation similar ‘

to that of the Mayﬂower Madam.
Contrary to what Raider officials
might have you believe, the
anticipated move back to Oakland
has nothing to do with tradition.
It deals with the green — $0.66
billion dollars worth. _
Which is more than Los Angeles
could offer 01’ Al Baby. And more
than Sacramento could offer. Or

Irwindale.

To the highest bidder, the
spoils. And the spoiled.

All Davis did was tell the world,
“Hey, I have a National Football
League franchise here. Who wants
it, and how badly?”

Oakland didn’t just wantsit. It
lusted after it, with a passion
beyond the value of the money
and rational spending.

Part of the deal the city
promised Davis, after reviewing

the other competing cities’ offers, ’

includes a $54.9 million franchise
fee, $53.5 million in renovations
at Oakland-Alameda County
Coliseum, guaranteed sellouts for
the initial five years worth
approximately $19 million and
nearly $2 million guaranteed in
concessions and parking.

Or, as Ed Snider, lead negotiator
for the Los Angeles Coliseum’s
private managers, put it, “I fear
we’re a day late and a dollar
short.”

Skip the day late stuff, Ed.

Make no mistake: the Raiders
belong in I Oakland. The fans
adored the Raiders there. The
fans passed time with them in
L.A.

When you think Oakland
Raiders, you think Ken Stabler,

Ellis gets All-American status

Pitt’s Elbert Ellis earned All-American status at the NCAA Indoor
Track Championships held in Indianapolis last weekend by placing
sixth in the 5S—meter hurdle event with a time of 7.27 seconds in the

‘finals.

This came one week after the Panthers had a disappointing
performance at the IC4A championship meet at Harvard, which was
won by George Mason University. Darrin Gillaspie ﬁnished third in
the ﬁnals in the high jump event with a leap of just over seven feet.
Keith Dowling placed seventh in the 3000 run, improving his
‘ personal best time by 11 seconds. The two-mile relay team reached
the finals but failed to place in the event.

Lockout

Continued from page 8
special pool being set aside for
the best players after their second
year.

There have been professional
strikes over the past two decades
whichhave been resolved, but if
this current baseball dispute is
simply left alone, then something
very deleterious to the game could
happen. The players are so

disenchanted with the owners
because of their collusion right
after the last contract was signed,
that they may just decide to
cripple the game and sit out the
whole year.

As each day passes, more
frustration seems to be coming
out of the mouths of the
negotiators. “Any concept, no
matter what it is has salary

arbitration they say no to,” Fehr
said of the owners on Sunday.
“Any concept doesn't matter to
them if it has salary arbitration in
it.”

Nothing is going to be solved
in the very near future. It is now
time for baseball to get back to its
normal business and have a
“cooling—off” period in the

negotiations. Preseason camps
should be opened, and
approximately a three—week
hiatus in the labor talks should be
implemented. This way, Fehr and
O’Connor could quit beating their
respective heads against the same
wall and resume talks fresh from
avacation. Meanwhile, the players
could concentrate on doing their
best to get ready for the season

without scurrying to get
newspaper updates on the
negotiations. '

The fate of baseball in 1990 will
not be decided by either Fehr or
O’Connor. Fay Vincent has the
entire game plopped squarely on
his shoulders.

Play ball, Fay.
