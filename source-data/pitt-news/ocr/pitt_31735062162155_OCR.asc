Denenberg Runs for Senate G0)’d035€€kSR€-EIGCTIOH

Pledging a government of, by and
for the people and not for special
interests, Insurance Commissioner
Herbert S. Denenberg, 44, today
announced his candidacy for the
Democratic nomination to I the

“Government," Denenberg
said, “is the number one consumer
fraud and it’s about time we do
something about it. I know
government can deliver in the
public interest.”

Denenberg charged the nation
faces a crisis in leadership far
overshadowing every other pro-

I blem confronting the people.

“Both the Executive Branch and
the Congress, with but few
exceptions, have lost their resolve
to lead. They are afraid to face up
to the difficult problems that must
be faced. Until we solve this crisis
of leadership, we can solve nothing
else,” hecontinued. . V ,

“Unless we get new leadership,
unless government starts to fight

Herb Denenberg

for the people instead of against
them, the problems of today will
quickly become the crises of
tomorrow.”

Drawing on his past record of
consumer advocacy in Pennsyl-
vania’s Insurance Department,
Denenberg promised the voters a
new leadership founded in the
public interest.

“We need a consumer advocate in
the US Senate, not just another
politician or bureaucrat.

“I believe that I can do these
things and be these things as a
United States senator from Penn-
sylvania. I took an insigniﬁcant
regulatory body like the Insurance
Department and transformed it into
a nationally recognized consumer
protection agency. I believe that I
can expand upon that record of
achievement in the US Senate."

Denenberg, in the May 21
primary, will be pitted against
another political maverick, Pitts-
burgh Mayor Peter Flaherty, who
announced his candidacy last week.

There are two other candidates in
the running, Villanova professor
John Logue and the Rev. Frank
Messaros of Harrisburg.

The Senate seat they hope to win ,

is currently held by Republican
Richard Schweiker who is running
for re-election on a platform of
reform in the areas of campaign
ﬁnancing, Congressional spending

procedures, and pension securityf

Denenberg has served as Insur-
ance Commissioner under Gover-
nor Milton Shapp since January
1971. Since then, he has been
involved in insurance reforms and
sponsored the controversial no--
fault insurance bill waiting ratifica-
tion.

Prior to his appointment as
Insurance Commissioner, Dene'n-
berg was the Loman Professor of
Insurance at the University of
Pennsylvania, his alma mater.

He is co-author of Risk and
Insurance,_ and author of The
Insurance Trap; Unfair at Any
Rate. ’

To Congressional Seat

_BY MATTHEW KENNEDY
Congressman Joseph M. Gay-
dos, Democratic. representative
from the 20th Congressional
District of Pennsylvania, has

announced his candidacy for

re-election.
Gaydos was first seated in 1968

death of Elmer J. Holland, and was
subsequently re-elected to Con-
gress in 1970 and 1972.
Outlining the challenges facing
the country, Gaydos cited the
Watergate scandal as a major blow
to national unity, government
credibility, and executive effec-
tiveness. A
“My response,” Gaydos said,
“is the Administration's domestic
program is in a shambles. He

Americans Blamed for Energy Crisis

BY BILLHADUCK

“The American people are to
blame for the wasteful way we've
used our energy," said Deputy
Federal Ene-rgy Commissioner
John‘ Sawhill, Thursday, in a
Pennsylvania Town Meeting tie-in

- of the seven Pennsylvania Public

Television“ Network (PPTN) sta-
tions. '

[Editor’s note: The following-is an eyewitness account of an incident
which occured in Oakland Saturday night. We did not'write.a news
story of the confrontation because the police could provide no details of

the incident.

We would like tozemphasize that the following is an

eyewitness, or personal account, it does not purport to be a news

story.]

Sporadic street ﬁghting erupted,

in Oakland Saturday night, leaving
three people arrested and ﬁve
injured. The incident stemmed
from what a police spokesman
termed, “Alot of kids with nothing
to do." .

Speaking from Hershey, Sawhill
was able to discuss the energy
crisis with Governor Milton Shapp
in Philadelphia, Federal Energy
Assistant Administrator Stephen
Wakeﬁeld here in Pittsburgh, and
about 30 other panelists in
Scranton, Erie, Allentown, and
Univeristy Park.

V An experiment, it was the first
time all seven PPTN stations have
joined together in a live, interac-
tive, state-wide program.

Sawhill. suggesting the energy
crisis isn't as bad as it seems, said,
“We haven't had blackouts and

Shapp replied; “I’ll buy some of

sarcastically. “It's not a crisis--as
the President said, it's only a
serious problem.”

He attacked Nixon-’s ten year
program, saying, “The only way
we’re going to get out of this is a
crash program.” - H

Wakeﬁeld, from’ WQED‘, said,
“No piece of legislation is going to
move tankers from the Gulf coast
and land them in Pennsylvania.’-'
He also blamed the American
public for the shortages. “We use

a crisis is." A

The abundance of coal as a fuel
became an issue as Shapp
revealed, “There is enough coal in
Pennsylvania alone to supply the
entire country for two or three
centuries.”

According to Rochester and
Pittsburgh Coal Company Presi-
dent Charles Potter, however,
“There is no coal mined in this

_country that can be burned in

Pittsburgh," legally, because of
strict air pollution laws.

Sawhill contended
environmental laws should be
relaxed to let coal burn.

Shapp disagreed. feeling the
standards should be kept, that
technology would ﬁnd a solution.
“Necessity is the mother of
invention,” he said. “If you relax
the standards, they’ll never make"
any innovations.” 3

“When he [Nixon] announced

Alternative Curriculum is a
strange word to many Pitt
students, but to those currently
enrolled in Pitt_’s Alternative
Curriculum (AC) program, it-is an
enlightening new process of
learning which may characterize
the standard curriculum of the
future. I

Evolving from a recommendation
made over three years ago by a

‘University Arts and Sciences

Review Committee, [in what was
then considered a radical proposal]
Alternative Curriculum is now
halfway into its second term.

It was one of three basic
proposals design’ed to discover
what type of program should be
formulated for freshmen making
the complicated step from highly-
structured high schools to the
individual freedoms of college.

The project began last summer
when letters_ explaining the new
curriculum were sent to incoming
A healthy response
from the students created the need
for a lottery at orientation to
determine the 130 students who
would be involved in Alternative
Curriculum.

Another 20 were selected by
interview with the AC faculty. Paul
Hertneky, a member of the Student

Government Board, was one of the ‘

students accepted by interview.

“ Open education , " Hertneky
said, “is a program designed to
give people options to different
areas of study. Students in
Alternative Curriculum can design
their own schedule and choose the
subjects that will ﬁll it.” AC

students can take all their
semester’s credits in the program
or mix their schedule with regular
University courses.

“There is a newsletter published
every week so we know when an
offering is being conducted,”
Hertneky said. “An offering is
given by some faculty member on
any given subject. Each week
there are different offerings to
choose from. A student only goes if
he's interested and has the time.
We also schedule student work-
shops on particular subjects.”

Alternative Curriculum students
can feasibly take a week off from
every scheduled function at Pitt
and still be operating as a full time
student. It is up to the individual to
take the responsibility of learning
upon themselves. '

The Truth About Waterbeds

Waterbeds represent an exciting and serious improvement over the old fash-

gienic values of the waterbed for many years. When sleeping on a waterbed

lawyers to decide. I don't claim to
be qualiﬁed,” Gaydos said.

Gaydos denounced present Ad-
ministration domestic programs as
“dismal failures" and claimed the
highly touted foreign policies of
Nixon's State Department have left
the country in a worse economic
position than ever.

The weakness of Nixon’s exec-
utive branch, according to Gaydos,
has resulted in government of-
ficials everywhere facing a growing
tide of distrust in their constit-
uencies. “It rubs off on
everyone,” he said.

Gaydos felt the greatest national
priorities were domestic ones, as
opposed to maintenance of an
international role. “You have to
take care ofyour own problems, set
your own house in order if you want
any respect," he said.

Referring to Nixon's announce-
ment that the worst was over, and
rationing was disappearing as
a necessary option, Gaydos said,

“He's made many statements that
have been proven false--I'd pigeon
hole this one with the rest."

Gaydos advocated a strength-
ened student loan program, a
decrease in whati he termed
“surplus fundings” to military
programs, and more federal
concern with housing and benefits
for the aged.

Big Bad John: Law and Order Man

in the Kent State incident. It was
John Mitchell, our Attorney Gen-
eral, who saved the nation from a
torturous investigation of the
murders of four harmless students.

Afterall, what possibly could
have been gained by learning the
truth? Once again, our streets
were made safe to walk.

Along with six other ex-Nixon
aides Mitchell has been charged
with conspiracy, obstruction of
justice, making false statements to
the FBI. perjury and lying before a
grand jury or ‘court. .

No American, should be sur-
prised by the recent indictments _of
the former presidential aides,
particularly Mitchell. Anyone who
conducted the business of the
Justice Department as Mitchell
did, could easily become involved
in such illegal campaign activities.

However, Mitchell's involve-
ment in the Watergate scandal is
not as grave a crime against the
nation as his management of- the
Justice Department while Attorney
General.

As Attorney General he was

acting in the interests of the
people. As campaign manager
Mitchell was working only for

Richard Nixon.

Mitchell talked tough during his
reign of terror in the Justice
Department. Since Watergate he
has stopped talking completely.

The phrase “Big John" does not
fit the man anymore. And no
longer do we hear the term law and
order from the law and order

administration.

Poor John? No sympathy should
be expressed for John Mitchell.
His activities have not only
victimized a nation. They have
victimized a people.

Throughout history the Amer-
ican people have had a great
respect for the judicial processes.
That faith was entrusted in -the
office John Mitchell held for four
years. Mitchell’s behavior has
been contemptuous of the Amer-
ican political system and the
American people. And this is the
greatest crime of all. ._

He and his companions in crime
have denied us the ability to
believe in our government.
Mitchell and his cohorts have
denied the government an oppor-
tunity to function for the people at a
time when we cry out for just and
moral leadership.

Mitchell is not the only fine
public servant to defraud the
American people. The list has
been growing since last spring.

But, it is Mitchell who best
represents the “deceit, craft,
trickery, and dishonest means" the
Nixon administration has used to
manipulate the American people.

Mitchell's days in court have just
begun along with those other ﬁne
public servants. Haldeman, Erlich-
man, Colson, and Richard Nixon.
As a result the American political
system and the American people
are hanging and “twisting slowly
in the wind." ”

Seminars
Dear Ms. Sexton:

This letter concerns the Career
Seminars and the student apathy
towards them. The Career
Seminars a_re designed to beneﬁt
students to give them some help in
choosing a careerand ﬁnding a job.

A lot of time and effort was put
into these seminars. There was
made available to the students a
wealth of information.

I realize that the majority of
students have already decided on
their major, but this doesn’t help to
explain the lack of participation in

“the workshops on Placement,

Registration, etc. I have learned
much information at these work-
shops, information which will prove
valuable when I graduate and start
job hunting.

I feel sorry for the large number of
students who have such a small
concern for their future that they
couldn't give up a few minutes of
their time to beneﬁt from the
Seminar.

Sincerely.
David Goldberg

Course Evaluation Dealt

Untimely Blow by SG

An open letter to the Provost, the
Deans of FAS, CAS, Education,
General Studies, Pharmacy and
Engineering, the Student Govern-
ment Board, the Allocations
Committee, Dr. Grace Lazovik of
the Center for the Improvement of
Teaching, Dr. John Townsend of
the Physics Department, Phil
Keryan, former editor of the
Undergraduate Academic Review
and his staff, the Pitt News, the
University Times, and the stu-
dents, faculty, administration and
friends of the University of
Pittsburgh who may bejinterested
in the improvement of teachingat
Pitt:

Useful and meaningful course
and teacher evaluation is a very
difﬁcult thing. This is the primary
reason, at least at Pitt,,that it has
not been established on a contin-
uing basis. One partially success-
ful attempt came over a period of
seven consecutive terms, from the
Winter of 1970 to the Winter of
1973, in the form of" the
Undergraduate Academic Review
(UAR). As the co-editor of the ﬁrst
ﬁve books, I had an opportunity to
study evaluation of teaching
(thanks to Dr. R. Cox of
Measurement and Evaluation, Dr.
Grace Lazovik of the Center for
Improvement of Teaching, CIT,
and Dr. John Townsend.) To think
that the UAR was a haphazard
evaluation system, founded by‘ a
few interested but naive students,
is not true. -

I worked on the UAR for all of my
four years at Pitt. It is somehow
justice that during that time, barely
a ripple of interest and criticism
was raised. Yet since I’ve left, as
you all know. the UAR has been
disbanded by the Student Govern-

ment Board (SGB). I want to take .
this time to thank them on behalf of '

the undergraduate students at Pitt.

Instead of a publication, which
SGB considers too technical and
not helpful, the students have
nothing. A commendable job, one
must admit. Four years of work,
experimenting,research, huge
amounts of effort by myself and
quite a few others, and thousands
of dollars. Wiped out by one order
of “cease and desist" by those
all-knowing and all-powerful few
known collectively as the SGB. Do
they really know what it means to
evaluate a course or a teacher? Did
they know the purpose or the
rationale of the UAR before they all
but killed it in November?

The purpose of an evaluation
cannot be merely to serve the
students. No more than it should
be to merely serve the faculty. The
UAR was designed,
designed I must emphasize, to help
a teacher know the effectiveness of
his/ her teaching, and to inform the

students of a teacher’s past.

carefully‘

Pitt. The UAR was dedicated to
this goal, with the hopeful result of
improved teaching to the satisfac-
tion of both the faculty and the
student body. But you must bear in
mind that you are not dealing with
a machine, as the teacher, or a
product to be seen, as the student.
You cannot measure the product,
the increase in knowledge and
intelligence of the students, with a
ruler, and then make appropriate
adjustments on the machine. You
are dealing with attitudes on the
part of the student and careers on
the part of a teacher. Neither is
simply dealt with.

In January, 1970, we began with
similar ideas about evaluation as
the SGB has. We soon found these
intuitive notions on what a student
wants out of a course and its

- evaluation extremely inadequate. I

stayed with the project as it grew
into the UAR‘ and began coopera-
ting with the CIT. It was a learning
experience for all involved. It was
a sharing of feelings and ideas
across the huge student-teacher
barrier. It was ﬁnally starting to
work. Before the SGB commits the
UAR to its ﬁnal grave, I urge each
and every one of you, who is
concerned enough, to look at the
growth of the UAR. Look at the
past issues; they are in Hillman.
Learn what was done and why. (I
refer you to two of my articles;
University Times, vol. 5, no. 5,
Nov. 9,‘ 1972, and Pitt News, vol. 6,
no. 30, Nov. 13, 1973.) If you
would take the time, stop into the
CIT and meet with Dr. Lazovik.
She is a nationally known expert on
course and teacher evaluations.
Learn what we were doing those
three years.

The UAR was never meant to be
a ﬁnal thing. It has a history of
change. We considered it only a
beginning. It needs interested
students and faculty to help it grow
But there is a lot to
learn from our work. Do not try to
begin again. Learn about our
mistakes. Research this as you
would any other project. Talk to
the people involved; students and
faculty. Do not assume that you
know all that is necessary about
teacher and course evaluations. I
will be willing to answer any
questions sent to me, if you take
the time to ask. Finally. to the SGB,
do not blindly just kill the UAR.
Remember that you are not here
mainly to govern. You are here as
students. Work at making Pitta
better learning experience, by
helping to make the teaching
better. Killing the UAR and
wasting all of the knowledge that

made it what it was would be a V

horrible setback for evaluation at

Pitt.

blacks came running towards the
Towers. away from the hamburger
joints.

I ran up the street to see what
was happening, and walked into a
mass of Oakland police who had
stopped traffic at Atwood and
Forbes. Walking down the street,
displaying their clubs, the police
tried to disperse the crowds, which
by this time had reached intimi-
dating proportions.

I spoke to several of the officers.
and they said they did not know
what was happening. but wanted to
break up the crowd. One black
approached the policemen and said
a band of whites had beaten him
up. A large bloody welt over his
left‘eye conﬁrmed some physical
violence.

Five minutes later, a white male
pushed into one of the
numerous police cars on the scene.
The injured black stood next to the
‘car, yelling at the arrested person.

As the car raced off, I and those
around me thought the incidﬂn

was closed but within a few
seconds the white male reap-

had driven a few feet up the street,
and then released the man.
Instead of “beating it” as he was
instructed, the alleged fighter
returned to the spot where his
accuser stood. A pushing match
ensued between the two, both

police and onlookers tried to break M

up the scuffle.
Police again ordered the white to

leave. but he resisted, claiming he .

had to find his jacket. At this point
the black said he wanted to press
charges but was not absolutely sure
this was the person who had hit
him. .

In the middle of this chaos, a
man approached the police and
said another fight was taking place
on Oakland Avenue. Everyone
immediately fled in that direction.

Down the street stood one black,
hunched-over, holding his stomach

and moaning. He said he had been

police, who numbered over 10 by

this time, were running in all
directions. covering each alley-
way.

I heard a lot of commotion of
Sennott Street and went to see
what was happening. A beating
had left one black sprawled on the
street. Directly in front of him was
a police van with two whites inside
it.

Across the street were a black
and white fighting, with police
trying to break it up.

Out ‘of nowhere’ appeared the
black who had been beaten up first.

This time his whole face was
covered with blood. and he was
holding his side, crying. He passed
out in the middle of the road, and
then was put on a stretcher and
sent to Presbyterian-University

Archeological lWonderland

BY TOM VERBISH

Volunteers are wanted for a
summer school in archaeological
ﬁeld techniques to be conducted at
a Maya site in northern Guatemala,
according to archaeologist Nicholas
M. Hellmuth who heads the Yaxha
Project. Two-to-eight weekcourses
June through July are being
offered at the lake-side Yaxha site
in the jungles of El Peten.

“What we are looking for,” said

. Hellmuth, who has degrees in
A anthropology from Harvard and

Brown, “are adaptable, perse-
vering people with a genuine
enthusiasm for archaeology.”

Courses are being taught in
architectural recording, artifact
processing, photography, mapping
and surveying. Field trips will
include the Maya centers of Tikal,
Uaxactun, Seibal and Copan.
Course credits, including optional
Spanish, can be arranged.

A well-known outpost of the
Mexican Teotihuacan civilization,
Yaxha is, with 500 structures, the
largest Classic Maya site in
Guatemala after Tikal and the

HARRISBURG AP--Gov. Shapp
vetoed a strict antipornography bill
Friday, terming it unfair, unwork-
able and unconstitutional.

“It would be virtually impossible
to conjure up a bill more certainly
unconstitutional,” Shapp said in a
three-page statement.

He said the legislature, “acting
in haste, has created a patchwork
crazy quilt_of constitutional inﬁr-
mities” that could “retard legiti-

_mate controls on obscenity for

years...” -.

The measure passed the Senate
26-20 and the House 151-34. The
House vote would be large enough
to override aveto, but the Senate
vote falls short. The legislation,

strongly supported by the Catholic
Church and opposed by the movie
and book industries, would have
given district attorneys new powers
to move against material judged
obscene.

It contained stiff criminal penal-
ties and would have allowed
confiscation and destruction of
pornographic material once court
appeals were exhausted.

Sen. Charles Dougherty, R-
Philadelphia, said he would try to
override Shapp’s veto only if he can
find enough support beforehand.
At least 32 or 34 votes--a matter of
dispute now--are needed, in the
Senate to override. *

Shapp Vetoes Antiporno Bill

in the Senate since the bill
originated in that chamber.

Shapp said the bill was uncon-
stitutional because it permitted
prior restraint and seizure of
material in bulk without a hearing,
could bar access of minors in
bookstores and create unwarranted
trial delays.

“All of the foregoing are
provisions which directly assault or
may assault individual rights
guaranteed under the Consti-
tution," he said.

While vetoing the bill, Shapp
said there is an “urgent need to
control the flood of offensive
material that is literally forced
upon the public through adver-
tisements outside of movie thea-
ters, publications displayed on
newstands and X—rated drive-in
movies visible from highways."

He called for passage of
legislation to control public display
of sexual material and to stiffen
penalties for giving offensive
materials to minors.

Shapp’s veto brought harsh
reaction from the bill's supporters._

“Gov. Shapp has taken another
step towards weakening family life
with his veto of the aiitipor-
nography bill,” said Rep. Martin
Mullen, who will face Shapp in the
Democratic gubernatorial primary.
“Perhaps our antipornography bill
was not perfect but we have to
draw the line somewhere in order
to protect our citizens.”

The legislation attempted to
follow the definition of obscenity as
outlined in last year’s US Supreme
Court ruling. It said material could

_be outlawed when an average

person applying community stan-
dards finds the subject matter
appeals to prurient interest, is
patently offensive and lacks serious
literary, artistic or scientific value.

and seventeenth centuries is-

currently on exhibit at the
University of Pittsburgh Art
Gallery in the Frick Fine Arts
Building. The exhibit will remain
open Tuesdays through Sundays
until March 29. The works are on
loan from the Carnegie Institute,
Museum of Art and have been
prepared for exhibit with the help
of David Wilkins from the
University of Pittsburgh and
Karen Hellerstedt from Ch'atham
College.

The period covered by the prints
primarily is concerned with the
Baroque style which began roughly

in the late l500’s and. early 1600’s.

One of the primary characteristics’
of Baroque is a feeling of
movement and action. The human

body was often depicted during this ’

time as being elongated, twisted or
in some way contorted. Harmony
created by well balanced compo-
sitions was no longer typical and

works became full of movement“

and action.

Baroque is a blanket term
covering post-Renaissance and
Mannerist art. The Baroque style,
however, developed very differ-
ently from country to country. The
two artistic schools represented in

the exhibit are the Dutch and

Most will remember David from
his work with C,S,N,&Y and the
fantastic songs they wielded.
“Long Time Gone”, “Triad”, the
sad and yet beautifully mystifying
“Guinivere” are a few of the songs
which made the late sixties go a
little easier. His “Byrdship”
helped the musical scene in
America turn right around with its

Playwrite Guillermo Borrero’s
Museum is where the collective
experiences of the human race are
preserved and presented to the
spectators (or participants). Birth
and death are enacted and twisted
around until there is no longer any
The

love, insanity, fear, magic, infanti-
sadism and the primal
scream.

The Museum is the co-creation of
director Richard Mennen and the
eleven participants in a workshop
he is conducting. The production is
based very liberally on a script by
Borrero.

There are a few major characters
and just the mere suggestion of ‘a
plot. Amalia(Sharon Landes) and
Deborah(Karen Kornfeld), are two
women with a constantly shifting
relationship, becoming mother and
daughter, mistress and servant,
and sisters to one another. They
live with the Colonel (Ryan

f(‘ﬁ'-Cutrona) and a twenty-five year old

“child” (Donald Young).

There are no settings and very
few props, only an extremely tight
ensemble of actors who have
turned their bodies and voices into
precise, expressive instruments.»
They are capable of communicating
a wide range of human emotion and
experience.

Group therapy techniques which '

were oriented toward the creative
process were used in this collective
effort. This therapy session

’ atmosphere creates an impression

of spontaneity. There are moments
during the performance when the
actor/participants seem as sur-
prised at where they are going as
the audience is.

The irrational forces of the
human mind are given free rein
and the verbal and visual imagery
is violent and impressive. The
influence of Artaud is seen in the
outrageous and bizarre acts of
cruelty and the emphasis on the
dark side of human nature. For
example, there is a scene where a
man whips an armchair for several
minutes. A

There are multi-level emotiona
and thought currents running
throughout the entire production.

examples. The swing of the thirties
is caught in-the great “Jada.”

The section behind them is a’
remarkable example of what studio
people are doing these days. The
clear piano work, the fine rhythm of
the percussionist and the low down
bottom line of the acoustic and
electric bass...the sound that
makes the older music of America
as fine as it is. A simplicity that
can transform a simple melody into
a composition of such varying
changes and harmonies...that’s
what this band does.

: intense experience

pleasantries with their guests, they
undergo a sudden shift in mood
and are crying out in terror. Their
surface behavior and their sub-
conscious conflicts are seen simul-
taneously.

Positive and negative forces are
shown in conflict with one another
and blend together until their
boundaries become confused. A
woman is in labor and a priest
chants exorcism rites in Latin over
her, so that it is unclear whether
the woman is carrying‘ a positive
life force or a demon inside of her.
When she finally gives birth to a
beautiful little vinyl doll, half the
characters believe it is real and the
other half don’t. We all know it’s a
doll, but when it’s dismembered, a

collective shudder runs through the
audience.

The use of ritualistic devices
(chants, repeated speeches, and
slow, ponderous movements) cre-
ates a disturbing yet beautiful
effect. In our demythologized
society with its lack of meaningful
rituals, most people have forgotten
how important they can be.
Director Peter Brook talks about
the possibility of ﬁlling this gap
with a ritualistic theatre, where
watching a play would become a
quasi-religious experience. This
production proves that it can be
done. Museum is an intense
experience, both on the immediate
visceral level and more subtly, on
an intellectual one.

among the artists featured are

Pieter Breugel the Elder, Sir
Anthony Van Dyck and Rembrandt

The works on display are-

primarily engravings and etchings,
processes which were, very basic-
ally, done by engraving usually
onto a copper plate, then using this
plate to make prints. The process
was a very difficult and time
consuming task. Unlike painting or
drawing an artist must rely greatly
on his imagination and experience
in etching or engraving because he
is very removed from the finished
product of his work. An etcher or
engraver could never be certain of
what his finished product would be

Bryant Captures East,

Panthers Finish Fifth

BY G.W. STEVENS

Annapolis. Md.--George Bryant
may very well be the best
118-pound wrestler in the country.
One thing for sure. he is easily the
best 118-pound wrestler in the
East. and he proved that this
weekend as he captured the.l974
EIWA championship. In addition
to winning the top honors in his
weight class, Bryant also was
awarded this year's Sheridan
Trophy for the most pins in the
least time as he recorded falls in
three out of his four matches. His
outstanding ltournament perfor-
mance enabledthe Panthers to

ﬁnish fifth in the overall team
honors.
Going into his final match,

Bryant needed a pin to send Pitt
ahead of Syracuse in the team
scoring. Histopponent was Dan
Blakinger of Harvard who soon
found that he was no match for the
firey Pitt junior. Bryant took only
two minutes and 22 seconds to
polish Blakinger off and the five
points Pitt was awarded for this
match gave them fifth place by a
57‘/2 to 57 advantage over the
Orangemen.

But Bryant wasn’t the only
Panther to come up with a good
effort this weekend. Freshman
Rande Stottlemyer also won him-
self a place in the NCAA

tournament to be held in two weeks I

as he finished third in the
126-pound weight class. Stottle-
myer lost only one match, to

eventual champion John Fritz of
Penn State in the semi-finals by a

   

‘Nationals.

6-4 score. Rande then went on to
defeat Dave Schaefer of Cornell in
a consolation match as his
pre-season goal of reaching the
Nationals was realized.

Pitt will be sending four
wrestlers to Ames, Iowa for the
Senior Wally Morrell
will also be competing in ‘the
tournament due to his fourth place
finish this weekend. Morrell was
defeated by Penn State's Dan
Brennenian in the semi-finals and
then dropped his consolation match
to Bob Hartman of Navy. Morrell's
qualification came pretty much as a
surprise as he finished the regular
season with only a marginal dual
meet record. _

The only other Panther to place
in the tournament was 142-pound
Ron Selfridge who also finished
fourth. He was able to win his first
two matches but then went down to
defeat in the semi-finals. dropping
a 5-3 decision to Scott Myers of
Rutgers. Selfridge was not very
active during the regular season
and could also be considered a
surprise finisher for the Panthers.

In any event. he will get another’

opportunity to prove himself in the
National tournament.

The overall team title in this
year’s Eastern tournament was
awarded to the Naval Academy as
they upset defending champion
Penn State, 135 to 113‘/2.
Perennial power Lehigh was able to‘
gain third place honors with 109
points followed by Cornell with 65.

In what turned out to be the most
important game of the season, the
Pitt basketball team outbattled
"West Virginia at the Field House
Saturday for an 83-78 victory.

The win closes out the Panthers’
regular season record at 23-3,
tying the 1929-30 campaign for
most wins in a season.

After suffering consecutive losses 1

to Penn State and South Carolina,
the Cats were aware that their
chances of advancing in the.NCAA~
playoffs with a three game losing
streak were not good.

But everything is under control
now as far as Coach Buzz Ridl is
concerned. “Now we’re ready for
the NCAA’s,” He declared before
his hasty departure after the game
to scout the St. Joseph’s-La Salle
game.

By defeating La Salle 76-71,. St.

V Joseph’s won the Middle-Atlantic

Conference and will meet Pitt in
Morgantown, W. Va. Saturday at
7:10 pm_ in a first-round. NCAA

, game.

Shooting just 41.2 per cent. the
Panthers had difficulty keeping the
Mountaineers from defeating Pitt
for the‘ second time in three
months. _

Neither Ridl nor outgoing WVU
coach Sonny Moran had kind words
for the officiating. Pitt’s Jim Bolla
and WVU’s Scott MacDonald
fouled out, and many players were
in early foul trouble.

Billy Knight and Mickey Martin

Skaters Roll Over Indiana

YAIER LEHRER

Futility is a very good word- It
describes many situations that
could not be described otherwise,
and it especially gives a good
picture of Indiana University's
efforts against the Pitt hockey club
last Saturday, as the Panthers
drubbed their opponents by a 10-1
score at the Civic Arena.

If the puck was ever out of their
zone, the Indiana skaters could
hardly remember it, their only goal
scored on a fluke deflection off Pitt
defenseman Glen Hyde's skate.

The only way the Indiana team
could get the puck out of their zone
in the first period was to ice it,‘
subsequently bringing the puck
back into their zone for the faceoff.
The only thing that stopped the
Panthers from scoring early was
some tough defensive play in front
of the net by the Indiana team, but
at 7212 Rick Vernon burst right past
two Indiana skaters with the puck.
He then put on a good fake, got the
goalie out of position, and shot the
puck into the net to make the score
1-0.

With just under five minutes left
to play in the opening period, John
Finney, a very unheralded defen-

Bolla may" have posted his finest
performance of his career had he
not gotten into foul trouble. He
scored six of Pitt's first eight points
on easy shots from underneath.
enjoying the unfamiliar role as
tallest man on the court.

Pitt built upa 13-point lead at two
differentpoints in the first half, but
West Virginia hung tough, and cut
the lead to eight atzhalftime, 46-38.

The two teams matched ;baskets
as the second half began. Then it

looked like Pitt might break it open _

after a fantastic pass from Knight
to Tommy Richards gave Pitt a
ten-point bulge and a lot of
momentum.

Knight fired a one-handed line
drive from center court through a
maze of Mountaineers to Richards,
who was streaking for the basket.

The Moon Township guard’s
lay—up put Pitt ahead by ten, and
sent the sellout crowd of 5.308 into
a frenzy.

Showing much more poise than is
expected from a 10-15 team, the
Mounties fought back, and as the
Pitt shooters cooled off, junior
college transfer Eartha Faust
caught fire, and almost single-
handedly sunk the Panthers.

The 6-3 guard poppedin shot after
shot from incredible distances, and
whilethe vaunted Pitt defense kept ,’
WVU from penetrating, it was
unable to control Faust,‘ who was
popping from all over the floor.

West Virginia racked up ‘ten
straight points midway through
the half, racing from a seven-point
deficit to a three-point lead, 69-66.

Faust began to cool off, and the
Cats got their offense rolling. With
Keith Starr sinking four straight
free throws and a long-range field
goal, Pitt broke open a five-point
lead, then held on to the ball to
wrap up the win.

A message scrawled on the Pitt

locker. room blackboard by Kirk
Bruce summed up the game and

TRAFFIC was heavy in front of the Indiana nets Saturday afternoon , 
at the Civic Arena as Pitt rolled on toward the WPIHA championship,
trouncing the Indians, 10-1. Pitt has but two games remaining before
overtaking CMU for a first place finish.

So, the four remaining Panthers
will now have two weeks to sharpen
their skills for the March 14-15

Bryant will have to be considered
the man to beat in the 118-pound
class and Rande Stottlemyer will be

sive player, took a pass from Bobby

Indian goalie to give the'Cats a two
goal edge. With 43 seconds left in
the period, Denny Browne con-
nected for his first of four goals in
the contest assisted by Glen Hyde

4 and Rick Vernon.$

At the end of the first period,
Johnny DeFazio, in goal for the
high ﬂying Panthers had a good bid
for his fourth shutout of the season,
but with just over two minutes gone
in the second period a deflected
puck gave Indiana a gift and took
the shutout away from the Pitt
goalie. But that was the last time,

that the puck would find its way
into the Pitt goal that afternoon.

With a tripping penalty on Dan
Skena of Indiana, the Panthers
were on the power play. The Cats
could not set up a good drive on
goal all during the time that they
had the one man advantage, but
with six seconds to go the penalty
to the Indiana skater, Kerry
Browne tried a shot. His try at the
goal was deflected, but Denny
Browne picked up the rebound and
shot it into the ‘Indiana net.

With one and a half minutes to
go in the period, Browne scored
again on a pass from Rick Vernon
to make the score 5-1, and that was
the score at the end of the period,

horse.

Pasterick. a freshman from Belle
Vernon, Pa. broke his all-around
record for the third consecutive
home meet. compiling 49.38
points. ‘

The second occurence out of the
ordinary was Senior Mark Strah-
ler's farewell performance on the
still rings. His superb effort was
worth 8.73 points, a personal high
which earned him a standing
ovation from his teammates.

Both Perez and Army Coach Ned '

Crossley admitted the meet was
overscorecl. -due to only three
judges covering the event. But this

. -could not take the luster out of the

Panthers’ shining day.

“We’re the only team in the
Eastern League to jump so much in
one year,” Perez stated proudly.
He was being mobbed by well-
wishers long after the meet was
over.

Crossley seemed to concur.

‘“This is the best Pittsburgh effort
since 1963 against West Point."
The Cadet mentor was pleased with
his three freshmen all-around men,
particularly Mat Holm. who scored

at the Eastern Gymnastics cham-
pionships this upcoming week-end

horizontal bar prompted Crossley
to speak highly of his changes at
Cornell. also.

Perez has no such illusions of any
of his gymnasts winning at Cornell.
‘But he.is taking four. possibly five
of his members up. which should
give them much needed experience
for the future.

Rob Pasterick will compete in the
floor exercise, parallel bars and
long horse vault. Mark Boyett will
‘enter the floor exercise, and two
freshmen. Gus Papantonio and Don
Stevenson. will do the parallel bars
and side horse. respectively.

It was fitting that such a
marvelous ending for Perez and the
team would come against Army.
Perez saw freshmen boys ‘ he
coached as an assistant at West
Point three years ago come back as
confident seniors.

The dual meets are over for Pitt,
but the progress will not be halted.
he gymnasts practice all year,
polishing their routines and learn-

ing new ones in search of next’

year's success. All the gymnastics
program needs now for a winning
team is an assist from the athletic

Pitt freshman Bert Snoznik
placed eighth out of 40 in the
one-meter diving competition.
Among her competitors were
winner Barb Seel of Clarion and Ce
Ce Herron of Princeton, both
national calibre divers.

In the three-meter competition,
Snoznik placed 10th despite set-
backs. as she was in eighth place
going into the finals. Herron won
that event as Seel took third after
injuring her hand in the 50-yd.
backstroke. (she doubles as a diver
and sprinter.)

Mam_ie Heretick could be con-

‘ sidered high point Pitt swimmer.

She qualified seventh in the
200-yd. freestyle in the prelim-
inaries. The pharmacy student
improved her prelim. time in the
consolation finals [7-12 places] and
placed tenth with a 2:08.07.

The Piranhas’ 400-yd. medley

Coleman placed 13th, just missing
consolations.

Freestylers Coleman, Price,
Heretick. and Glynnis Lyons
combined to take a tenth place in ‘a
team record of 1:48.95. The high

point of that relay was Coleman _

and Heretick sprinting to times
below the 27 second mark, splitting
times of 26.6 and 26.4 respectively.

The Pitt freestyle relay team of
Coleman, Lyons, Heretick and
Anne Wallisch placed 13th, nar-
rowly missing consolation finals

with a time of 4:11.56, though their 

performance was a team record.

Overall, the_ Pitt squad per-
formed well and both coach
Virginia K. Grindle and assistant
coach Kate Mathison were pleased.

“Our girls brought their times
down and have much to be proud
of,” V said ‘Grindle.

“They can be proud of handling

Mathison. “We asked them to
swim races a certain way and they
came through in each race.”

Princeton won the meet, with
