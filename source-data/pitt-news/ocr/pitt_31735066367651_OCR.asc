 Fire Alarm Rouses

Holland Residents

O

A false ﬁre alarm roused

residents of Holland Hall from

their beds and brought ﬁre engines racing to the quadrangle

at 2:30 a.m. Tuesday morning

The false alarm, which was pulled on the box outside
the head —resident’s door, is being considered a serious of-
fense by the officials who are carrying on an extensive inves-

tigation.

Don’ Van Houten, director 6f
housing and head resident of H01-
land Hall, commented, “This is an
especially serious offense where it
concerns the ﬁre department.
They had the expense of making
the trip, the danger of using all
possible speed in getting to the
University, and the possibility of
another ﬁre while they were in-
vestigating the false alarm.”

Van Houten also said that sev-
eral other complaints were
brought out as result of the alarm.
The ﬁre bell neither ' rings long
enough nor loud enough to ef-
fectively nlert residents. Floor
counselors had to wake’ the ma-
jority of the students because of
the inadequate warning ‘system.

Jan Haughton was also con-
cerned that the stairway on the
girls side of the dorm was
blocked by the desk attendant
who instructed the male resi-
dents to walk back up the stairs
to the fifth ﬂoor and use the
stairs on the boys side of the
dorm. .

“Although ﬁre drills have been
postponed during the past terms
because of dangerous circum-
stance and cold weather, we are
still considering carrying out plans
to have one during the spring
term.” Van Houten concluded.

Cheerleading 4
Squad Grows

The University Cheerleading
Squad has re-organized into a ten-
member body, including two more
people than past squads. Lou Ro-
mito, a sophomore and major in
marketing and advertising is the
head cheerleader. Richard Stoller,
who also majors in advertising
and is a freshman, is assistant
head cheerleader.

The female part of the squad
includes Jay Eidemiller, an Eng-
lish major in her sophomore year,
Beth Baumgart, who is afresh-
man and math major, and Shelly
Estreich, another freshman and a
psychology major.

Karen Rosenberg, a sophomore
transfer student from Ohio State
University, majoring in‘ Spanish,
Marlene Nolfi, a.freshman and
French major, and Barbara Wer-
ner, a physical education major
and sophomore, are also new
squad members.

Their male counterparts are
Tony Lufrano, a senior with a
major in sociology, Stan Pittler,
J, freshman and pre-dental ma-
jor, and Randy Werin, the Pitt
Panther.

According to Lou Romito and
Richard Stoller, with the addition
of two members to the squad
many of the problems of past
squads have been intensiﬁed.

“Lock of proper funds,” Lou
Romito stated, “is keeping the
cheerleaders from doing an ade-
quate job.” As Romito said, the in-
crease in membership has not
brougt a corresponding increase in
the budget for the squad, set up by
Student Government. . , ,

Consequently, Romito feels,

MC Proposed
Big Brother
System Okayed

Council Questionnaire
Results Show Positive

Reaction to New Plan
By JIM‘ HUFNAGEL

The Men’s Council plan for
a “big brother” program,
which was so “overwhelm-
ingly affirmed” by the Men’s
Council questionnaire, has
been approved by Dr. William
B. Crafts, - dean of ‘ men, Steve

Johnson, president of Men’s Coun-
cil, announced today.

A list of names for suggested
big brothers was compiled from
the suggestions of student lead-
ers, honor societies,‘-«and dormi-
tory floor counselors and each
person on the list has been sent
a letter with an application form.

The applications, will be return-
ed at one of the_two preliminary
meetings to be held Thursday and
Friday at noon.

“Of course in any survey of
this type it is ineitable that we
will miss some very able'peo-
ple. Therefore, we will make
applications available to anyone
who does not receive one, either
on the eighth ﬂoor of the Cathe-
dral or at the meetings,” John-
son said. i .

The purpose of a big brother
will be to serve as a contact and
advisor for incoming freshmen.

Continued Operations

Scheduled for Spring

' By JIM NELSON W
The Student Senate decided in its weekly meeting last
Wednesday to supervise publication of V a freshman index
and guide. After lengthy discussion at the last two meetings,
the Senators decided that the two publication which Student
Government currently sponsors, The Polaris and the Cal-

endar, are inadequate.

No decision has been made as
to the actual content of the pro-
posed publication, but several pos-

sibilities have been discussed. Ma-.

jor consideration has been given
to including pictures of incoming
freshmen. ,

In presenting the idea of a new
freshman index and guide, Irving
Rothman, director ofstudent pub-
lications, commented that the
major advantage of having fresh-
men pictures included in this pub-
lication would be a means of
identiﬁcation.

To Aid Freshmen

“It would aid freshmen in get-

ting to-know each other,” he said,
“it would help upperclassmen to
have some means of identifying
the incomingsfreshmen; it would
give them a sense of belonging to
the University; and it would be a
great aid to fraternities and sor-
orities in rushing.” -
The Senate, howeyer, was
doubtful about Rothman’s per-
sonal reasons and motivations
in presenting this particular
type of publication to Student
Government, and decided to re-
solve discussions until the next
meeting. when there would be

Weeli Vacation

Set to Follow
Winter Term

Next year students will have a
week of vacation between the
winter and spring trimesters. The

inter-trimester break will coincide ,

with the Easter recess from Wed-
nesday April 18 to Wednesday
April 25, Endicott Batchelder,
Registrar, announced today.

Freshman orientation will begin
on April 24. The 25th. willl be the
last day for payment of fees for
the Spring Trimester and classes
will begin Thurs, April 26.

According to Dr. John Geise,
Assistant Chancellor in charge of
Student Affairs, “the reason for
the, period between trimesters is

_ to give students a breather. Many

have indicated that there is too
fast a turnover from one trimester
to the next. ,

“I feel that it would be to the
students’ advantage to take time
to prepare for the next term,” he
said. .

"By TOM BRYANT .

Chief Justice Earl Warren met briefly with the Univer-
sity Scholars following last Wednesday’s Honors Convoca-
tion and then attended a luncheon with the Chancellor and

various community leaders.

According to Vice-Chancellor John Geise, the reception
in the Chancellor’s oﬁice enabled officials to recognize the

C honor studentsin a more informal.¢r

and personal manner.

Warren was tapped into Druids
as an honorary member after the
Chancellor’s reception.

_ Recognizes Leadership
“We granted Warren an hon-
orary membership in recognition
"of his countless accomplishments
as a leader of men, a scholar,
and participant in activities to
beneﬁt his fellow man,” said Al
Resnick, who presented the award
to Justice Warren. “He personi-
fies the ideals for which Druids
stand."

Warren was also awarded a
key and certiﬁcate of member»
ship in’ commemoration of his
visit.

Later iii the afternoon. Justice
Warren attended. a luncheon with.
the Chancellor and Mrs. Edward
H. Litchfield.

The Supreme Court leader was
questioned by Dr. Litchﬁel.d on
“the point of bravery or courage
in the p1'eparin_g of decisions that
profoundly affect basic rights un-
der the U.S. Constitution.”

(Editor’s Note: Roma-rks of
Justice Earl Warren were sub-
mitted to the Pitt News by U.S.

Congressman. J antes Ful1';o*n,.
.D()rmont Repu b l1'.ca»n.. )
Chancellor Litchﬁcld referred

particularly to questions of emo-
tional content, human interest, and
prejudice such as the segregation
issue, which, the Chancellor stated,
“in the future could be referred
to by historians as “the basic de-
cision of the 20th century.”
Revals Pressures

“It takes less courage to make
decisions upon issues that are emo-
tional when the person making the
decisions is farther away from the
public itself,” the’ Chief Justice
said. .
“Our court thought about the

Issue of segregation a. long time.
Our court was most conscious of
the responsibility th at was
placed on the Trial Courts and
the Courts of Appeal in this
country, who had original juris-
diction.

“When we on the US. Suprcrne
Court made the decision in segre-
gation cases that local courts
should decide all issues before
these cases came. to us - that
put a great burden on the District
Judge because of the localities
where the cases arose and the
community pressures the judges.

       

   

“As an example of this situa-
tion, a district judge in4New Or-
leans had to meet a great re-
sponsibility under‘ local and com-
munity pressures." ‘ -

Justice Warren said that

require any more courage than
“is required of any judge on any
level in this land.”

“Justices are entitled to no sym-
pathy for making ﬁnal decisions
on major issues. All we are en-
titled to, is that we be given
credit _tthat we are doing the best

jurispru'de«nce in the kind of order
—-that the American people will
know the law from one end of
the land to the other and that our
American people will respect our
decisions.”

N ets Over $600

Over 100 men from eleven fra-
terniti.es./on campus collected $650
in their door to door canvas of the
Wightman-Squirrel Hill area for
the American Cancer Socicty’s an-
nual educational and fund raising
campaign.

Under the direction of Univer-
sity co-orcinators, Gary Harrison
and Rod. Brim, both members of
Sigma Alpha Epsilon social fra-
ternity, the “Col.legiate Crusaders”
knocked at more than 3000 doors
in their effort to better last year’s
‘donation of $250. ’

That campaign was carried
out by one fraternity, SAE, and
bettered any other contribution
by 20 per cent.

“Since it worked out so well
last year,” Harrison said, “we de-
cided to put it through 113‘ as an
all-fraternity drive, and we are
quite pleased with the results.”

SAE led the campaign this year
by collecting 50 per cent more
than any other fraternity with a
total of $147.93. Sigma Chi was
second with $96.20.

Team captains of the pzn.'ticipat-

Ben ‘Copeland
Helps in Research,

Anatomy Labs
By W. SCOTT LARSON ~’

Perhaps the most carefully
chosen faculty and staff mem-
bers at -the University are
those of the Medical School.
These people must be highly
trustworthy , and
outstanding in their ﬁelds. Ben-
jamin,Copeland’, embalmer at the
University Medical Schoo1,'fu1fil1s
all of these requirements with a
great deal to spare and has proven
that he is a great asset to this
vital organ of the University com-
munity. _

Ben, as he is known to students
and faculty members alike, has
the all-important duty of. supply-
ing the ﬁrst year medical students
with their necessary materials for
the Gross Anatomy laboratory
work.

Assists Professors

In_ addition to performing these
duties, Copeland has been assist-
ing Dr. Jacob Priman, Medical
Anatomy Professor, in an ana-
tomical research program. He also
assists Dr. ‘Tryphena Humphrey,
Professor of Anatomy, ‘in the in-
struction of a neuro (brain)-ana-
tomy course at the medical school.

Copeland received most of his
practical and formal training
while he was with the U.S. Navy
during the Second World War
and the Korean conflict. He was
not only sent to an embalming

‘school by the Navy, but also re-
ceived training as a surgical
technician in the operating
. room. ,

It is in the latter field that: Ben
has assisted well known surgeons
in various delicate operations, and
has received high praise from
these physicians for his work.

Fought Epidemic

When he was with the Navy in
the summer of 1953. he was sent
to Orange, Texas, when that com-

munity was menaced by a polio

epidemic. He set up several polio
clinics and instructed workers at
the local hospital in the use of
the iron lung and occupational
therapy. '

For these tireless efforts in
fighting the disease, he won the
commendation of the city offi-
cials of \Orange.

Ben’s duties at the "Medical
School bring him_in contact with

a variety of people. Through these_

contacts ,he has become the friend
of nearly every medical student

BENJAMIN COPELAND

Friend of the freshman med students.

in the school.
Objects to Formality
When working with the stu-
dents, he always demands an in-
formal atmosphere.

“One of the few things which
makes ‘me angry is when a stu-
dent will not call me Ben,” he
stated. ' “Perhaps one day when
I have become old and grey, I .
will consent to -be called Mr.
Copeland.”

Out of admiration for ‘ t h e i r
friend, the medical class of 1964
the
award. The
tradition of the award stems from
the annual presentation of the
“Golden Apple” to the outstand-
ing professor in the medical school
by the students.

Since Ben was only a staff
member and was not eligible to
receive the “Golden Apple,” the
students instead collected apple‘
seeds, clustered them into the
shape of __ his initials. painted

“ them gold,‘ and presented them
to him to show their apprecia-
tion for- the friendship and-guid-
mice which he has extgnded to

It was decided that the handbook

The Senate also" passed a reso-

through the Spring Trim_ester.VAl-
though the past ‘Student Senate
made attempts to do this and

Because of the limited num-
ber of senators that will be on
campus during the summer ses-
sion, it was decided that all
voting will be completed by a
proxy vote from the senators
not living on campus.
This procedure allows the Sen-
ate to carry out business all year
round instead of being dormant

assures total representation of

'  ﬁ'gurinl'iFdcts

If you, as mem_bers of this University, haye often won-
dered. what small college life is like, then you should just’

,.‘look around your own campus.

With the adoption of the trimester plan in the fall of
1959, came a decline in the number of full-time undergrad-

uate students, a trend which has continued each term since
then. ’

This fact presents .a rather parodoxical situation since
during the same span of time, while the number of under-
graduates was decreasing, the University expanded its fa-
cilities, added new administrative departments, raised its
admittance and academic requirements and brought to the
school distinguished scholars. ‘ ‘

_,Yet, according to statistical material received from the
Office of Student Records, when the University operated.
on the semester plan, the net enrollment each year was over
6,000. Including the two semesters nd the summer session,
the University’s total enrollment .or the year -1956-57 was
15,503, for 1957-58 it was 15,433 and for 1953-59 it was 14,569.
' ' In comparison, the net enrollment for/the first trimester
year, was 4,395 with a total enrollment at the end of the
three terms and thesummer session of only 12,124.

The statistical data available shows that this\ year
there has been a further decrease in the number of under-
graduate students. During the Fall term, 4,798 full-time

9 students enrolled and in thepresent term there are 4,522.
“Since only 1,400 are expected in the Spring trimester, al-
though a slight increase over last year’s Spring term, the

total enrollment will be less than 11,000 for the entire year,
another decrease. “

In determining whether future trends will showwa rise
or continue in the~same manner, the observer can only—base
his hypothesis on the statistical data available. We can be
op.timistic‘to some degree since requests for admission in
the Fall are exceptionally high, but we cannot really ascer-
tain how many of these students will actually come until
late in the summer.

Possibly what is just as important as the direction of
this enrollment curve, is why the trend has progressed in
the direction it has. .

"It is not the change from the semester to the trimester
that has created the problems, but -rather the unforseen dif-
ﬁculties that this undertaking brought. .

One diﬁ'iculty is that the input of freshmen in, the Fall,
although it has increased steadily for the past two years,
does not yet compensate for the output of graduation and

‘attrition.

Possibly another reason for thedecrease is the way
in‘. which the tuition rate has ascendedso rapidly. The
last increase which hit only the out—of-state students could
haverather drastic effects. Whether there will be many
out-of.-staters failing to return in the Fall because of this
increase is not as serious as whether‘ the out-of-staters who
applied for admission ‘before the tuition was heightened in
January will make Pitt their final choice. If many of them
change their minds, the University’s trimester could meet
a climactic defeat. '

Other factors besides the previous mentioned most like-
ly have inﬂuenced’ this decrease, yet there is only one other

iwhich has drawn student’s attention to it.
In attempting to raise the academic standards, the ac- A

tions of some faculty members, who are mainly responsi-
ble for developing and stimulating student’s minds, indi-
cates that too many of them believe that quantity increases

Arts appears to be thexinstrument that may salvage what

 remains of the assembly 1ine'whi1e at the same time elim-

inating the mass productive system of surfacing that dis-
enchants every entering freshman lured here by the book-
let “Trimester and You.’,’ Student’s opinion constitute by
all means an available sales pitch.

. Yet, the decrease’1n the number of full-time under-
graduate students produces good effects for the students

“ themselves. For example, the ratio of faculty members to

students has increased thus providing more opportunity for
closer contacts between the two groups. ,

Although this end is also desired by the University,
this does not compensate for the continued decrease of the
undergraduate body. , ‘

Yet, inferring as to what these statistics reallyamean
is not the responsibility of a small number of students but
is rather the responsibility of the entire University com-
munity. There could be unnoticed factors that may account
for this decrease or this decrease could even be desired at
this time for some unknown reason.

Whether you considered this a problem depends on
your statiistical judgment.

Society Breeds Decline . . ._

Communication Chaos

By Ina Aindur
There is a prevalent myth publicized in aca-
demic circles that the ability to communiéate dis-
tinguishes man from other animals. Though this

may be a valid statement theoretically, any one who .

has observed twentieth century
American society can easily re-
fute its factual validity.

Of course, much depends on . .
how one deﬁnes communication.
If'by comunication one means
the ability to make one’s wants
known, the ability to give direc-
tions and to follow instructions,
then man communicates. How-
ever, if one deﬁnes comunication
as meaningful inter-subjective
"interchanges which permit one
human being to enter the closed lonely world of
another human being, then in -this respect wehave
failed. . ' ’

Communication, in America, has diminished to
twenty—four hour a day cocktail party conversa-
tion. The ‘vapid smile, the ready hand shake and

the meaningless phrase have replaced any con- .

structive attempt at true communication. Perhaps
the existence of television which has aptly been
described as packaged fantasy and the existence of
the-almost obsolete radio have contributed to the
demise of communication. For the television-
watcher or the radio-listener need be only passive
observers. If there is anything distinctive about
human relationships it is that they necessitate ac-
tive participation between two subjects.

Getting to know someone is a monstrously diffi-

Shop or Supermarket . .'.

The Commerc

By Matthew Nesvisky
The Pitt Book Center is lacking something.
One’s reaction to my above declaration would
probably be an uplifted eyebrow or two and a grim,

sanity-doubting stare. Then I would more than
likely be taken by the hand and

 

porium to gaze upon its endless
aisles of wonderous sights.

And I agree that the sights
are indeed wonderous. Nobody
can receive more pleasure than
I do as I go hungrily picking my
way through the literary traffic
of Signet Street, Ballantine
Boulevard or Pocket Book Place. A

It is a marvelous city, a
growing city, an eternal city. In
fact, it has grown and expanded so much that it
hardly resembles a book store at all.

My conception of a book shop is quite different
than our department store on Fifth Avenue, For
me, a book store has to be tiny —— an almost micro-
scopic establishment that most passersby pass by.
It is impossibly dirty and the dust can be seen mov-
ing sleepily about in the soft light‘ of a naked
light-bulb. '

And the greatest asset of the tiny book store is

Convocation. Attendance . 

_ By Trudy Weiss

‘ ~ What could students at the University of Pitts-
burgh_ possibly hold against political leaders ‘that
they did not turn out "en masse to hear and ‘see
Chief Justice Earl Warren last week? Why is there
such enthusiasm foriliterary per-
sonalities who have contributed
~signiﬁcant1y in the " cultural I
world, and such lack of enthusi-
asm for a statesman who has
contributed at least as signiﬁ-
cantly inthe judicial and politi-
cal world?

Poet Outdraws Justice"

« Pitt students are not so om-
niscient that they could have
known in advance what Justice
Warren was going to speak
about, or what he was not going to speak about, as
guest at the 1961 Honors Convocation. Neither did
they possess this power in the past three years, and
yet Robert Frost, Archibald MacLeish and Pearl
Buck were well attended at past Convocations.. The
same can not be said of Justice Warren.

‘This dignitary was impressed by the uniqueness
of Pitt’s Convocations. ,“,‘I' know of no other college

' or_‘unl‘versity or the land which does this thing,”

 

 

 

   

cult task. It involves entering into the world gf
another human being and attempting to see reality
as he sees it. It necessitates a sustained effort to
reconstruct the past of a human being in order to
understand his present more sympathetically. And
contrary to popular opinion there is more to’ a
human being’s past than where he was born, what
his father does, where he went to college, and what
he does for a living. But to those who are too lazy
to ﬁnd out the rest, there is always a four—way
bridge party.

_It may be that another reason for the lack of
communication in American society, besides lazi-
ness, is fear. Communication cannot take place
without self—exploration. One must have thought
about oneself in order to talk about oneself to an-
other person. If oneself consists of where one went
to school and the other stock information, then
this is all of which one’s conversation can consist.

If it is true that the main problem of every

human being is loneliness, and there is not much-

reason to doubt this assertion, then if there is not
even a half-hearted attempt at comunication, one
is locked up in his own private world.

Man hasworked for many centuries to perfect
his techniques for communication. Television,
radio, and the printing press have made a formerly
large world into a very small one. Yet neither
television programs, nor radio programs, nor books
can replace the experience of human communica.
tion and exploration. Should this exploration cease
to be made, future generations can replace the ex-
perience of human communication and exploration.
Should this exploration cease to be made, future
generations can look forward‘ to a life of soliloquy.

ial Center

aroma of old knowledge and old adventure which
whispers from out of the covers of a'volume and
pleads: “Buy me! Buy me!” Unfortunately, the Pitt
Book Center’s wares seem to have a shiny, cello-
phane—and-tinsel aroma which urges the shopper to

‘ -“Buy Everything!”

In‘ my beat-up little book store, the proprietor is
always a round, white-haired little man with the
Ben Franklin bifocals to prove that he reads as
many books as he sells. He rings up your money
on what appears to be the ﬁrst National Cash
Register ever manufactured, and counts your
change, squinting in the sunlight which is ﬁltering
down through the SKOOB on his front window.

The procedure is slightly different at our A&P_

Book Center. The customer chooses one of the
check-out counters, hands over his money, or re-

ports his account number to the uniformed auto-9

maton behind the till.' He collects a receipt, a thank
you, and leaves. .

Pittsburgh does not have very many of my tiny,
iusedbook shops,'unfortunately. There is a section
of Lower Manhattan that I can think of off-hand,
h°WeV€1‘: Which I have had the joyous privilege of
roaming — asection which has about two or three
dozenof these establishments crammed together in
a sort of lackadaisical competition.

Center Offers US, but the —— well, charm, I guess -— q

is exhilarating.

he commented.

The Unhonored Absent

The audience he faced from the stage of the
Syria Mosque was comprised of honor -students and
§0Wned faculty members on the first floor, proud
parents and families in the ﬁrst balcony, and one

or two other students here and there in the bal-
conies. I i

What kind. of impression did the Chief Justice
carry away with him‘ from this seemingly huge Uni-
versity whose student representation did not ﬁll

.many rows of the Mosque’s balconies.

I did not have time to check the corners of the
Tuck Shop or other areas of intellectual meetings,
but in passing, did notice the full parking areas,
indicating that students were around someplace.

Honors Convocation is one of the rare occasions
for which classes are dismissed especially to en-
able all students and faculty to attend. Although
there has nevervbeen an entirely ﬁlled Convocation
hall, the students in attendance at this year’s cere-
monies were noticeably fewer than the number at
any one of the ﬁrst three annual ConvocationS-
This decline must have some bearing on the qual-

‘ity and qualiﬁcations of the guest.

Do ‘Pitt students not deem this prominent citizen
worthy enough? ’ ‘

‘Midcentury’ by John Dos Passos .

   

A uthor Recaptures
Old Punch, Poetry

By MATTHEW NESVISKY

Novelist John Dos Passos is a man of many words, as
shown in his dozens of books. But during the last few years,
either the public has not been listening to the words_or the
words just have not been worth reading.

The proliﬁc Dos_Passos seems to have broken this jinx,
MIDCENTURY, (Houghton, Mifﬂin, Co.; 496 pp.; $5.95).

The author also seems to haveO

recaptured much, if not, all of
the old‘ punch and poetry which
made the U.S.A. trilogy a modern
classic. But there the similarity
between the two works comes to
an obvious end.

Dos Passos is concerned with
the State of the Union. And by
Union, Dos Passos means any
group of men banded together in
a labor front. By simple exami-
nation of _,,the headlines of our
newspapers of . the last quarter
century, Dos Passos has come to
the conclusion that the modern
workman’s ﬁght for freedom led
to organized brotherhoods of dem-
ocratic slavery.

MIDCENTURY, of course, is
not all ﬁction, and only the re-
.cent history of the United States
could offer such a neurotic ob-
stacle course for a novel’s char-
acters to perform.

Blackie Bowman is doing his
best not todie, but as he sinks
away slowly on his deathbed_in the
veterans, hospital, Dos Passos has
him relate his symbolic life story-,
the pathetic, hard-bitten, two-ﬁst-
ed, sometimes almost even human
tale of how our present labor ma-
chine was designed,
painted and lubricated —- and how
thethousands of Blackie Bow-
mans became their own “tools.”

Much of the worth of the book,
however, is found in the bio-
graphies of our contemporary
ﬁgures which are sprinkled gen-
erously throughout. Having been
blended in with a master’s skill,
these sketches, although having
appeared in_ several top magazines
in the last few years, seem to be
as much a part of the novel as
the action of the fictional char-
acters. '

Dos Passos can be interpreted
in this book as one who wishes

he were not a member of our

 
  
      
   

 
  
 

assembled, ‘

culture. He is somewhat restrained
in his cry of pessimism, but he has
succeeded in bringing the cancer
of labor and its consumption of the
American individual.

Larry Lauchle  
Given Loudest
Appause

By TED COLTON
Sports Editor

IlllIIIIllllldllllllllllllllllllll:
IlllirctllvnllluIlrlauntlullllivvv

 

Last Wednesday night Pitt took time out to honor their athletes
at the annual Sports Banquet. Cal Smith,‘ Mike Ditka and Chuck
Reinhold walked off with the top awards, but it was little Larry
Lauchle who received the loudest applause.

The 130-pound wrestler just the day_ before concluded his col-
legiate wrestling days by dropping out of the AAU meet, where he
received a neck'injury. This ﬁnal match, which resulted in an in-
jury and in which Larry was beaten, is the exact opposite of Larry’s

’ wrestling career at Pitt.

At the banquet Lauchle was awarded the most Valuable player

award. by Dr. John Dickinson, president of the Varsity Lettermen
Club. In introducing Lauchle, Dickinson read off this impressive list
of athletic accomplishments: ‘He is a three year letterman, captain
of the 1960-61 wrestling team. Enrolledin the School of Education
where he majored in Physical Education. Member of the 1960 United
States Olympic Greco—Roman wrestling team, 1959 Eastern Inter-
’col1egiate Wrestling "Champion, and 1959 and 1960 runn.er-up in the
*’ National. Collegiate Championships. This year he captured everything.
Larry’s overall record while 3at the University: 51 wins, 4 loses and
0 ties.” . «

When Larry, took his place in front of the speakers’ table, the
better than 600 athletes, coaches, alumni and guests gave him a
great "round of applause which surely will long be remembered
in the young wrestler’s heart.

Athletic Director Frank Carver was the initial speaker at the ban-
quet. In his address the AD pointed out that the 1960-61 sports
year could have been better in quite a number of places, but was
quick to add that in the 130—pound wrestling class there could have
been no improvement. ‘

Later, Toastmaster T. F. X. Higgins remarked, “We should have
a football team full of 130 pounders. Then maybe we could win ’em
all.‘
I Larry received another honor-~when Carver presented him
with a gold watch in memory of winningithe National Champion-
ship.

It was quite a night. for the 130-pound small athlete. It marked

the end of a brilliant career at Pitt. The University of Pittsburgh
might have seen better wrestler than Larry and will probably see
better wrestlers in years to come. But it has _never seen—-nor will it
ever seen —— a man that has given as much as Larry has for his school:
his heart, his physical strength, and his alert mind.

As a way of introduction, we

this far, we will discuss the
fundamental strokes used in the

Ed, but the youngster got oil to a

Leslie, as skillful a grappler as
Ed had yet to meet, scored four
taked-owns in the ﬁrst two periods,
but he decided to let the Panther
escape, rather than chance Peery’s

Peery managed to move to

Awarded Grant

The Graduate Schools of Public

a $1,000 lectureship award from
the Sidney Hillman Foundation.
The foundation was established in
memory of the labor leader who
died in 1946.

The University, one of the 14
schools to receive a grant, will
use the award to bring a national
authority on urban renewal to the
campus in November for a week
of discussions and lectures. It is
hoped that the joint program will
stimulate greater interest in urban

“Uniforms cost 20 per cent more,

Summoning public opinion to
their cause, Romito brought in a
quote signed by four football play-

spent by the University to send
cheerleaders on -trips or to help
them back the school with spirit is
worth it.”

FALSE PRETENSE

A salesman claiming to con-

weeks by identifying himself
as a representative or associate
of the University.

The University announced to-

connection with the University.
He is selling encyclopedias.
