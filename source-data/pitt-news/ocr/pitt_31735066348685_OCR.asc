Vol. 69, No. 717

BY KEN GORMLEY

Harrisburg--Governor Milton J.
Shapp took a ﬁrm stand with a
group of student government
* resentatives from Pennsylvania
colleges and universities Thursday,
insisting there is no fat on the State
budget that could be trimmed off
and given to higher education.

Shapp, speaking to more than 200
student leaders here, said he
understood the ﬁnancial .crisis
students may be faced with as a
result of the proposed budget
allocations, but claimed there was
little he could do’ about it.

“I can’t blame students for
wanting more money,” he said.

“But we have to deal with the
problem realistically. There is only
so much money in the entire State
pot.”

He insisted his job as Governor
requires him to “look at the total
picture in the Commonwealth,”
and that the total “picture includes
more than just education.

According to Shapp, when it
became evident in January that the
State was suffering from increasing
unemployment due to recession,
his budget plans were drastically
altered.

“The budget got trimmed clear
across the board...including higher
eduction,” he said.

 Oakland's p Sen. lvlazzei

Faces Sentence Today

BY GENE GRABOWSKI i

State /Senator Frank Mazzei,

 1 victedmore than four months
ago of using his ofﬁce to extort _

$20,000 in kickbacks, faces senten-
cing at 1 pm today in US District

Court, the Pittsburgh Press" re-‘

ported yesterday.

Mazzei, South Side. Democrat and
member of Pitt’s Board of
Trustees,_has kept his seats and
retained legislative power despite
the conviction _in late November.
He faces a maximum of .20 years
in prison and a $10,000 ﬁne on each
of two extortion transactions.’ His
fate depends on the ruling of Chief
Judge Rabe F. Marsh, who could
force Mazzei out of his Senate
ofﬁce if he exercised. ’ his wide
discretionary power, according to
the Press. . . ~

Mazzei continues to represent the
43rd Senatorial District, which
includes Oakland. ‘ 1

‘ 1

In addition, he serves as chairman

 of the State Transportation Com-

    
 

I

 
 

mittee and as vice-chairman of the
Appropriations Committee.

Mazzei’s position on Pitt’s board
of Trustees still ~ remains in
question, however, according to
Board Chairman William Rea.

“Because of the unprecedented
nature of the situation,” Rea said,
“I’m not quite sure whether or not
the Trustees can remove a
convicted member."

"Rea added since Mazzei was a

— state-appointed member to the
,Board of Trustees, it probably

would be up to the Commonwealth
to rule on his removal.

“His appointment was made by
the State Senate,‘ and itmost likely
would be up to the State Senate to
remove him,” Rea noted. ' A

.Mazzei was app'ointedi.to Pitt’s’: -
Board of Trustees in 1973 by"

Senate Pro Tempore Martin L.
Murray. The. senator is one of four
Commonwealth Trustees serving a
four-year term.

The 36-member Board of. Trustees
includes 12’ Commonwealth ap-
pointees because of Pitt’s change
‘to a stateerelated institution in the
mid-60s. I ' i

Since his conviction, Mazzei’s
post-trial motions, the completion
of a transcript of his week-long
trial, and a written .opinion
upholding the conviction have
delayed the sentencing until now.

In addition, M_azzei’s'attorney, H.
David Rothman, has indicated he"
will appeal, a process that could
take another 18 months.

  Shapp: No PA Budget Hikes

The State House, and Senate
appropriations committees are
beginning consideration of the
Governor’s proposed budget
week.

Now that his decision on the
budget has been made, Shapp said
it would be wise for students to
appeal directly _to the legislature if
they want a larger allocation for
higher eduction.' V if

However, the Governor implied
he might veto such an increase if
the legislature passed it.

“I want to make this evident,” he
said. “As Governor, I have to obey
the Constitution. And that means I
am not going to approve any
budget where total money spent
exceeds money received through
taxes. _ .

Shapp agreed to meet with
representatives of the -student
leaders sometime in the spring to
review his budget with them. .

At one point in the question and
answer period, SG President Larry
Platt approached the Governor and

presented him with a gold T-shirt I

reading; “.START-UP now;..or Pay
Later.”

Chairman of the Pennsylvania
Student Lobby (PSL) Frank John
Muraca, of Penn State, attacked
Shapp’s budget plan as painting a

p ‘Start-up’

START-UP day provided the

"overwhelming impetus Pitt stu-.

dents needed to contact their state
legislators, according to partici-
pants interviewed by the Pitt News.

never would have appealed to their
state legislators regarding Pitt’s

how a tuition hikewould adversely

“I doubt ifI would havewritten if .

said. “But an organized effort like
this has a good chance of getting
something done, and so I added my

Gismondi, a state loan recipient
who-plans to «attend Pitt’s law
school next year, saidhe wrote a
letter to his hometown "state
representative. , I _

Tobi Rosen, a freshman, said ‘she
rdoubted‘ whether students asra
group wielded enough power to
inﬂuence Pitt’s‘ ﬁnancial allocation
‘for next year. 

“The letter writing is a superﬁcial
action,,” said Rosen, who currently"

bleak future for higher education in
the State.

“We understand the ﬁnancial
situation -in Pennsylvania,” he
said. “But students are being
asked to bear an undueiportion of
the burden.” s

Muraca pleaded with the Gover-
nor for additional funds to
universities and other institutions
ofihigher learning. He insisted that

‘thousands of students . will be-

forced to drop out if tuition rises

substantially due to lack of State r

Criminal on the Board

This afternoon’s sentencing of State Senator Frank Mazzei for his
extortion of $20,000 in kickbacks is of special interest to _the Pitt
 community. Because he represents the Oakland area in Harrisburg
I. and especially because he still occupies a seat on the University Board
of Trustees, Mazzei’s fate, as dictated by Chief Judge Rabe F. Marsh,
’ should concern every Pitt student.

Though Mazzei was pronoimced guilty over four months ago, neither
the state legislature nor the University has moved for his ouster from
his respective seats. Since Mazzei is a Commonwealth trustee, the

Gcillo Analysis
Found Incomplete

Dear Editor,

In his news analysis of the
Gallo-United Farmworkers debate
(Pitt News, March 24), Paul Mazur
claimed “the charges and counter-
charges from each camp, have
muddled the issues,” the issues
being Gallo’s’ role in the UFW-
Teamster dispute and the propriety
of honoring the UFW’s boycott of
Galo wines. It is obvious from his.
admitted confusion ‘that Mazur has
not taken the time to investigate
the somewhat complicated ques-
tions involved in this situation but
has instead chosen to rely on a brief
afternoon debate and a slick Gallo
propaganda campaign speciﬁcally
designed to present the world's
largest winery as a neutral and
innocent bystander in an interunion
war.
would have revealed Gallo’s not so
neutral and not so innocent interest
in defeating the workers’ chosen
representative, the‘ UFW," and
maintaining its contract with Ernie
and J ulio’s choice, the Teamsters.
A quick purview of the ‘Teamster-
Gallo contractwill, I hope, show
why Gallo is willing to spend
hundreds of thousands of dollars
ﬂying ad man around the country to
“muddle" the -issues and keep the
UFW out of the ﬁelds.

. Under a Teamster contract, Gallo

‘ is not requiredltoproivide garments

or tools necessary to protect a

‘worker’s health or safety, nor does

Spin the Bottle: A bottle_ of Drano
or equivalent hard-chemical liquid
is spun in a circle of merrymakers.
The player to whom the bottle

points must drain it in one breath.

Blind Man’s Bluff: Popular
among the upper-class executives
released from their positions
because of the economy. Two
players blindfold themselves, climb
into their two-sea_ter planes and
take off.~

Their challenge is to locate each

other in the sky, by voice-radio ‘ ’
.- communication only, and smash
, into each other head on, as fast as.

possible. Often the game ends at
nearly ten thousand feet when both
players run out of gasoline.
Three-Legged Race: As ' in the
older variation, two teams of two
players (preferably recently laid-off
by Penn Central) tie themselves
into bags

track. When the lights of a train

appear,» the players begin a‘

madcap, high-speed dash toward
the train. First to reach the
hurtling engine win.

it have to meet with a union
committee to establish mutually
acceptable health and safety
fields. A
Teamster contract requires that the
worker, not Gallo, provide his or
her own pruning shears, safety
glasses, gloves and other materials
essential to adequate job safety and
performance. Gallo also need not
provide adequate toilet facilities,
cool portable water, nor first aid
supplies. If a worker is called to
the Gallo fields and his or her
machine breaks down before work
begins Gallo is not required to
compensate the worker for even
travel costs, yet alone the
customary half day’s pay.

Under a Teamsters’ contract there
is no union hiring hall and hiring
ea labor
contractor who hires whom he
chooses regardless of a worker's
seniority or even his membership
in theunion. Once on the job a’

Gallo worker does not have the.

right to know his or her position on
the seniority list and can be laid off
without reference to seniority, this
being Gallo’s “neutral” way, of
exploiting a worker until he or she

A can no longer keep up with a fast

paced crews and then dropping
them for a younger worker able to
pick more grapes in less time.

Gallo can also subcontract its work,
which allows it to avoid union

presence completely whenever it so_

desires. Finally, Galloican ﬁre a
worker for “refusal to comply with
working instructions,” translated
that means. Gallo can ﬁre any
worker who refuses to enter a ﬁeld
recently sprayed with a herbicide
or insecticide, refuses to work in an

unsafe place (a right recently won:

by-the UMWA), or refuses to cross
a legitimate‘. union picket line.

How does the UFW stack up on
these issues? Every above
mentioned interest of the workers
is provided for in UFW contracts
(e.g._, with Almaden). Since, unlike
a Teamsters’ contract, a UFW
contract is negotiated and ratiﬁed
by the workers themselves there is
no chance of the workers being
denied the very fundamental rights
which drive them to unionization.

Gallo’s interest in such a_ _ba_re

Teamsters is clear--get as much as
you can out of your workforce in as

of innocence and non-complicity
are as hollow and corrupt as

Where Have All 

The Bagels Gone

Dear Editor:

Dur_ing.the past two consecutive
Passovers (Jewish week-long festi-
val dictating, among other things,
that Jews not eat bread or any
foods with leavening) I have

’notic_ed the absence of bagels in the

Tuck Shop. Not having discussed
the matter with the local dieticians,
I can only, guess the reasoning
behind their decision to deprive the
campus of bagels. One’s_ first
guess might be that the Tuck Shop
buyers might be under the ,
impression that one can’t buy, .
bagels during this Jewish holiday.
Alas, I do not wish to/ shatter
anyone’s system of beliefs, but the

:3

— Jews don't have any patent on the

bagel‘! My next guess might be
that the Tuck Shop feels that in s
clearing their counters of those
glorious bagel trays they are doing
some service to the Jewish
community at Pitt. Well, not all
Jews (expecially students) adhere
to.the dietarylaws, and it would be -
unlikely that observant Jews would
be offended by the‘ site of those
"bagels--they’ just wouldn’t eat
them. I am left to assume that the_
Tuck Shop buyers think that ONLY.
Jews eat bagels. This is sheer
bigotry! I suggest that the people
who run the Tuck Shop wise up and
stop ‘working under a cloud of
ridiculous stereotypes. ‘Get some
bagels...at least before I overdose .
on matzo. ‘ . ’
L’Chaim,
Felice Newman

Making your mark in business used to mean
carving‘ a "comfortable niche .for yourself and-stay-
ing there. Promotion was simply a_-matter‘ of time,"
provided you could spend:20.years inthe process.
But, today, business depends on technology. Tech-
nology that can’t wait a moment if it’s going to keep
pace with what's happening. -

P That's why, at Kodak, our basic reliance on sci-
entific research makes the need for creative young
minds more demanding than ever. Wemust have
people with drive and ambition, impatient to put
what they’ve learned into practice. People who get
all the freedom and responsibility they can handle,
and tackle our problems with their ideas.

Which, we’re happy to say, has helped many of
our scientists yield important discoveries. For
example:

The woman on the left has devised new and im-
proved photographic materials for specialized sci-
entific applications in fields such as astronomy and
holography. The young man is an expert on surface
analysis. His work in photoelectron spectroscopy

tography and trace metal analysis, which she’s ap-
plied to analyzing pollution in rivers and streams.

They came up with new problems while solving
some of our old ones. But they've uncovered some
promising answers, too. As they continue their re-
search, you may read about them again. The oldest
isjustover30. ,

Why do we give young "men and women so
much room to test their ideas? Because good ideas
often lead to better products. Which are good for
business. And we're in business to make a profit.
But in furthering our own business interests, we
also further society's interests. Which makes good
sense.

After all, our business depends on society. So
we care what happens to it.

Butlget round-up

BY PAUL MAZUR

. Inflation and recession have pen-
‘ etrated Pennsylvania State colleges
and universities and the three
state-related universities--Pitt,

.~ :Penn State and Temple. In an effort
l'_to avoid a tax increase this year,
Governor Shapp proposed a budget
designed to keep spending at a
V minimum. a

7 Although Shapp’s budget ex-
pands ftmding to all colleges and
jtniversities, it apparently is not
enough. Pitt, Penn State and
Temple may have to respond with
tuition increases, while in tuition
bike for the 13 state colleges and
Indiana University is built into the
budget.

“..By law, the amount of tuition and
fees at Commonwealth colleges is
determined by the State Secretary
of Education. Since the proposed
"budget, however, provides for a

  

PlEWS4Monday, April 7,''1975 ’

$25 per semester tuition increase
for those colleges, it would override
any move on the part of the
secretary. Tuition at the state-re-
lated universities is approved by
their respective Boards of Trus-
tees.

On the surface, Shapp’s budget
does call for an increase in funds to
the institutions of higher learning.
But the State budget for ﬁscal
1974 covered a 12-month period;
the fiscal 1975 budget covers a
15-month period, changing the
start of the ‘fiscal year to October 1
to coincide with the recently
changed federal fiscal year. As a
result, the increases are_ spread
thin because the money must last
an additional three months.

The proposed budget calls for an
increase to Pitt from the current
$52 million for 12 months to $65
million for 15 months. The other

 

state-related universities and state
colleges are faced with a similar
situation.

Shapp’s budget increases Penn
State's allocation from the 12-
month $94 million ‘to the 15-month
$124 million, and Temple’s from
the present $59 million to $79
million. '

Indiana University’s allotment

for example, already has an-
nounced a hiring freeze, and
possible cutbacks in programs to
meet the rising costs in all areas of
the University are being discussed.

Since each college has its own
problems, the Pitt News contacted
administrators at Penn State, Indi-
ana University and ‘Clarion. State
College concerning the difficulties

would be $21.3 million for one and
one-quarter years as opposed to the
present year-long $15.6 million
allocation. Clarion would receive a
$3.6 million hike from $9.7 to $13.3
million.

Faced with these low percentage
increases in state aid, Pitt, Penn
State, Temple, Indiana University
:and the 13 state colleges are
making contingency plans in the
event the State legislature does not
provide more money.

Such systems are found in and employed
by nature and are repeated throughout

funds. This money is used for the
agricultural research for which the
university is famous._

A decrease in medical support
would be expected.

Tuition would have to be raised.

No estimate of the amount of“

increase is available because the
Penn State budget ofﬁce is cur-
rently examining the situation.

There would be no salary increase
for faculty or administrators.

To cope with the new proposed
budget, Norris said Penn State is
making contingency plans like
other schools are.

INDIANA

Although the three state-related
universities are having some trou-
ble coping with Shapp’s budget,
the state-run colleges are in even
more trouble, because they are
even more dependent on it.

Like the other state colleges,

Indiana University will be caught
short in the ﬁscal crunch. Edward
Norberg, administrative assistant

. to the Vice-President of Finance,

pointed out several problems.

Norberg said Indiana would be
about $2 million short under the
requested budget. The Governor
proposed a $50-a-year increase in
tuition for the state colleges. But
Norberg said the Pennsylvania
Higher Education Assistance A-
gency (PHEAA) grants probably
would not be raised to cover the
proposed increase in tuition and
other rising fees.

An unknown variable at Indiana
University and other state colleges,
according to Norberg, are the wage
contracts currently under negotia-
tion. The faculty and clerical unions
are seeking pay increases.

CLARION

As a state college, Clarion is in a ‘
bind similar to that of Indiana
University. Acting Vice-President
for Administration at Clarion, Mat-
thew H. Marder said it is difficult
to give speciﬁcs because there are
too many variables.
rising utility rates and the outcome
of the wage settlement contracts
will also dictate the financial status
of the college.

 Recalling Warhol's Factory

- Q

.O?mge, and The Loves of Ondine--

/

BY RITA VITOLO

(Andy Warhol superstar Ondine
lives in Pittsburgh now, because,
he says, Pittsburgh is a good town
in which to recuperate in--and after
the wacky years at Warhol's
original film Factory in the Sixties,
recuperation is all Ondine wants or
needs.

Smart-talking, plump and full of
nervous energy, Ondine--on hand
to answer questions--begins the
first leg of a promotional tour of
two of his Warhol’extravaganzas--
Vinyl, the original screen version of
Anthony Burgess’ Clockwork

tonight at 8 pm in Benedum Hall.

Dieting away 15 pounds in two
days, on his way_ to a 60-pound
goal, Ondine reminisced last week
about the silver spray-painted days
at the Factory.

“There was no direction at the
Factory. There were ALWAYS
people doing everything,” he said,

recalling the days in the middle-
Sixties when Warhol’s ﬁlms‘ made
him an avant-garde ‘superstar.’
“You could be anything you
wanted to be.

“A whole new way of acting was
being proposed, a whole new way
of ﬁlmmaking was being proposed,
a whole new way of being involved
in acting was being‘ proposed at the
Factory. It was crazy...a volcano,
things erupting, something hap-
pening all the time.”

But there's no nostalgia for the
Factory, said Ondine, who, calls
himself an optimist and a realist.

“Half of them are dead,” he said
simply. “I'd be a fool to be
nostalgic for them, my dear. I’d be
nostalgic for corpses.”

Ondine was somethingof a free-
form personage even before
Warhol transformed him into a

  

F -

household name, describing him-
self once as Fire Island’s “most

vicious faggot.” /

Born Robert Olivo, the Catholic
kid from Queens met up with
Warhol in 1962 when he had the
voyeur (“he wasn’t in, he wasn’t
out,”) thrown out of a party that
was fast evolving into a nice orgy.
Warhol was fascinated, and out of
that grew a series of films that
included Vinyl, The Loves of
Ondine, and their 1966 epic Chel-
sea Girls, where Ondine’s violent
portrayal of the Pope became one
of the f1lm’s most famous’ sequen-
ces.

“Warhol had ‘a fixation for pop
commercialism. He gloried in it,
he reveled in it,” Ondine said of
the man who made the CampbelI’s

BY DREW PORVAZNIK

HG." Wells would have liked it.

He is the one who wrote The Time
Machine, and what happens in the
novel is not unlike what may occur
during Tuesday's Oscar ceremon-
1es.

Millions of television viewers may
find themselves locked in a time
machine. If they didn’t know
better, they might think this year’s
ceremonies were a rerun of pre-
vious years’.

There’s a Godfather nomination
for Best Picture again.

Jack Nicholson, Albert Finney, Al
Pacino, Dustin Hoffman, Ellen
Burstyn, Madeline Kahn, Faye
Dunaway, Ingrid Bergman, Bob
Fosse, Francis Ford Coppola, John
Cassavetes and Roman Polanski all
are nominated for Oscars again.

My job is to act not as an operator
of the time machine -but as a
clairvoyant predicting who will win
in the Oscar races.

Best Picture--I see the category
having a tight race between
Chinatown and The Godfather Part
II. My preference is for Godfather,

“Warhol’s very much an East

Despair, death and perverted

Sixties larger-than-lifle.

“Everybody there was a Catholic,
or used to be a Catholic," he said.
“You never went around saying
‘I’m a Catholic,’ but in the little
talks off-camera it always came

out. Everybody had gone through
it, they all had their little horror
stories.

“I managed to get hit on the head
with a bell by a Catholic, Brother

‘recuperate in,” Ondine said.

him, part of it came from himself.
Everything that was going on there
was just incidental to what Warhol
said and meant...it was just the
earthiest, most vulgar things you
could imagine.”

Making a movie at Warhol's
studio frequently just happened,

and if you didn’t want to join in,_ 

you didn’t have to.

“Warhol would say ‘Let's make a
movie about eating,’ and somebody
would start to eat and Warhol
would ﬁlm it. None of the movies
were ever edited. They were run
just like they were shot. It was
incredible. Loves of Ondine was
edited, but it was done on-camera
and the movie just shot, boom,
boom, right there on the screen.”

At another time, Warhol and
Ondine wrote a novel called--what
el_se?--A Novel, by Andy Warhol.

“There were tapes of my
conversations, my phone calls,
talking to people, pick-ups. For a

whole day. Twenty-four hours,”'

he recalled, “I could never go to
the bathroom. I’d say ‘Andy, I
have to go to the bathroom,’ and
he’d say, ‘You can’t. I have to go
with you.”

But the pale presence always kept
his distance, Ondine recalled, and
today, Warhol sees what’s left of
the old Factory gang only rarely.

“l was never a friend to Warhol.
Warhol never had friends. You
could work with him and you could

-love him, but he was never your

FRIEND.

“There was a girl who used to
stand on the street across from the
Factory and yell at Andy, stick her
arms out and SCREAM,
Andy’d say, ‘Look at that, she’s
crazy,’ ” Ondine said. “She ﬁnally
killed herself, with-a note pinned to .
her that said, ‘Thanks for nothing,
Andy.’ ” ' ‘

How could he keep his sense of
humor with all that going on?

“How could you LOSE it?”

Ondine asked. “There were bugs. _ ‘
All bugs, everybody around me.-‘’‘'*- 3 I

Crazy.”

But the silvery Factory was his
home until Warhol's near-fatal
shooting in 1968 by one-time
Factory groupie Valerie Solanis._
Hospitalized for several months,
Warhol closed down’. the old

’ Factory and moved to new quarters

uptown when he returned._
That and the subsequent rise of

Paul Morrissey, who master- _
minded the super-commercial
“Andy Warhol presents” epics like

Flesh, Heat and the recent

Frankenstein and Dracula, have
meant the end of the old ﬁlm
Factory.

Ondine cam_e to Pittsburgh's
Shadyside three years ago to teach

' drama, where he works occasion-

ally with the Pittsburgh Filmmak-
ers. He's been recuperating ever,
since.

“Pittsburgh’s a good town to

mean, I was going all those years,

now "I just want to stop. My dear,-I ‘

For Pitt football, the spring drills
underway right now will be the
most crucial since the arrival of
Johnny Majors, because--believe it
or not--there is more rebuilding to
do this year than there was when
Majors took over.

Ten starters graduated, leaving
holes in the team big enough to
drive a truck through. The ‘loss of
Gary Burley, Bill Daniels, Kelcy

Daviston, Glen Hodge, Mike
Bulino, Bruce Murphy, Dave
Spates, Mike Carey, Reynold

Stoner and Dave Janasek has
decimated last season’S. starting
squad.

“We have the greenest Pitt team
since.I’ve been here, facing the
toughest schedule we’ve faced in
ten years,” Majors said. “In a
certain sense -we have more
rebuilding to do than ever.”

.. The.‘ Penguins .- must,-,;have ,be.en

reading press clippings of training
camp before they skated onto the
Civic Arena ice for Saturday night’s
ﬁnal home game of the regulaf
season. j k

The game represented good luck

and zealous desire--and lots of hard.
work. Rookie Pierre,Larouche, who

cockily had announced his inten-

goals 30 and 31 in the ﬁnal ‘home

- game before a sell-out crowd.

The 19-year-old center set new
Pittsburgh records for goals and
total points by a rookie. Larouche
got a lot of help from his red-hot
linemates Bob Kelly and Chcuk
Arnason. ‘

Left wing‘ Kelly smoothly ‘made

__the transition from NHL bad,..boy
and all-round nasty to become a .

-formidable scorer. The “Battle-.
ship” unobtrusively raeked up
goals instead of opponents, and
ﬁnished the season with 27 to his
credit; His two,dozen assists, many
of which ﬁgured in Larouche’s
goals, combined with his goals to
give him 51 points for his best NHL
season. A former St. Louis hit man,
Kelly changed’ colors in mid-sea-
son, but never slipped from the
fans,’ or management’s good gra-
ces. ’ ~ « ‘

One thing Majors values very
highly is senior leadership, but if
Pitt were to play a game tomorrow,
a maximum of ﬁve starters would
be seniors. ’_

Some of the returning players are
showing a lot of promise, though.
Randy Cozens has beaten out Tom
Perko for a starting defensive end
position, and Joel Stone, a junior
offensive tackle, is “probably the
most -improved player on the
team,” according to Majors.

One of the interesting battles
is the ﬁght between Bob Haygood

-and Matt Cavanaugh for the
starting quarterback slot. The
.interesting thing about it is that
neither player has ever quarter-
backed in a major college game.

“Both of these guys need a lot of
work,” Majors said, “and we’ve

been trying to improve their
fundamentals. Haygood has
increased conﬁdence and has

improved his passing. We’re also
looking at some others at the
position, but right now it's between
Haygood and Cavanaugh, and
Haygood has the edge.” /
While the quarter-backing is
the
defensive backﬁeld boasts a cast of

. thousands. Only Dennis Moorhead
, is returning from last season, and

everyone from defensive backs to
transplanted wide receivers will be

‘goals, the highest among the
_Penguin,’s proliﬁc forwards.
Larouche’ s line totaled " 84 "goals,
and captain Ron Schock centered
for a combined 86 with left wing Vic
Hadﬁeld and right_ wing Rick
Kehoe. o _

Last year Apps ﬁnished seventh in
league, scoring. His “Century
Line” was the second highest

scoring line in the NHL with 107 '

goals,‘ behind Phil Esposito’s of
Boston. '_ _ _ 8 ~

Pronovost, another All-Star, is the
third highest Penguinscorer, be-
hind Schock, and Apps. Pronie’s 43

. goals brokehis record for most by,a

right wing. His 75 points make him
one-of the league’s top scorers in
this, his ﬁnest season. '
MacDonald, the easy-going left
wing on the Pens’ top line, fell off

his production of last year, when he

had 82 points. One of the oldest
players on the team, MacDonald
nursed badknees, a sore shoulder
and bruised’ ribs, but managed to
collect 27 goals and 33 assists.

But the real whiz kid is Schock._
The hard-working center ﬁnished
his sixthseason with Pittsburgh by
nearly doubling his point total of
last year. '

Schock’s 23 goals and phemonen-
al 63 assists--most ever by a
Pittsburgh player--gave him 86

points, enough to break Apps’ club
. record for most points in a~season. f

When the club awards were hand-
ed out Saturday, Schock stepped
forward three times. The blonde

_Penguin captain won the F and M

Schaefer Brewing Company award
forleading point scorer _and- the
Elmore Keener Memorial Award
for Players’ Player, and tied de-
fenseman Ron Stackhouse for the
Max Unger Most Valuable Player
award.

The recognition capped the best
season ever for the team’s most
versatile skater. Schock, along with
Lew _Morrison, Pete Laframboise
and Bob McManama, is one of the

Pens’ most efﬁcient penalty killers. 3

plethora of others (Leroy Felder,
Carlton Williams, Bob Jury, Mike
Propokovich, Ron Medley, Jim

Farley and more) will compete for '

the remaining two positions.
Another area that will need a total

overhaul is the offensive line. Pitt .
had to build an offensive line I

practically from scratch last season
and this year will be no different.

Carey and Stoner graduated and
Theo Lawrence opted for the world
of farming. 

‘» Stone has shown considerable’

iniprovement and Tom Brzoza
proved himself as a starter during

his freshman year. There arejstill.  3
three gaping holes to. be ﬁlled--at 
and’ '-center--and ’

guard, tackle
that’s a tall order to fill. _
Because of the inexperienced

offensive line, Pitt will be using as '
new kind of offense. Instead of the“ ’. ‘
I-formation, used much of last‘

season, the Panthers will play a

split back offense, starting both, 

Tony Dorsett and Elliot Walker
(provided his eligibility holds up).

“We’re going to have to run the 

type-of offense where the backs will

have to hit the holes quickly before 1 «

they close up,” Majors said, “An

inexperienced line will have trouble ‘

ment, only. to skate the next shift”

withouta break.

“Old Man” Hadﬁeld .weathered'
hostile blasts from fans and the
media, who called him the most
over-rated player in the league "and
criticized his hefty salary. Acquired
in an off-season trade from the New

York Rangers, Hadﬁeld lived up to

wily General Manager Jack But-
ton’s expectations. Hadﬁeld’, at _34
theoldest Pen, set the club record
for most assists by a left wing.
Hitting hard and scoring often,

Hadﬁeld had his best” season in» '8
. 1971-72 as the Rangers’ captain.‘
He scored 50 goals and 106 points 5 ’

in an amazing demonstration of.
perseverance. This season, Had-

co’s” 32 goals made him one of the "’

Pens’ four 30-goal -scorers. "The"
Penguins also are the only 

team to have nine forwards with 20 ; j

or more goals.

While the club’s been. solid up
front all year, the bluelines have
had more than their share of
problems. Lanky Dave Burrows, ax
tru defensive defenseman in this

time of Bobby Orrs and would-be

Orrs, limped qgamely through ‘the

season with one injury after ano--p

ther. Burrows missed just two
games with a broken foot and a

badly bruised torso. The 26-year- ~

old was paired with Penguin rook-
ies exclusively until NHL veteran
Barry Wilkins came from Vancou-
ver.

The craggy Wilkins joined rookie
Colin Campbell mid-wa'y through
the season to form an effective
‘defensive duo. Burrows has 17
points_;Wilr.ins, 35; and Campbell,-
19. Another pair anchored the,

Paradise has an imposing penalty

Stackhouse set club records for

keeping "those holes open too
long.”
‘ Some of the open positions on the

j"'!~12anther squad could be filled by

the ‘very big incoming freshmen,
but Majors is not counting on it.
“Right now, we’re trying to work
out our problems with what we've

late in the season and missed the
final games.

Skinny Bob Johnson, who began
the season in Pittsburgh but was
sent to Hershey as an extra man,
ﬂew back to join the Penguins for
the last week of the regular season.
Johnson played the final game,
against Washington.

As the last line of defense, the
goaltending had been sporadically
poor, then brilliant, during most of
the year. Then lnness and Plasse
got more help from the goals-
against conscious defense. When
the Penguins couldn’t score their
way to victory, they tried to prevent
their opponents from doing the
same.

Sound hockey strategy--but
something that was once foreign to
the Penguins. The change in
attitude and action came not a
moment too soon, as the Penguins
head into the first round of the
Stanley Cup playoffs against teams
that incorporated the philosophy‘
years ago.

For the first time in a long time,
the Pens collectively can claim,
glory. Individuals have set records,
yes, but together those individuals
have made the Penguins formid-
able championship contenders.

 

(Continued from Page 9),
under those conditions also.”

Friday's match against Duquesne
had to be canceled because of
inclement weather. It was
rescheduled for April 24.

“I'm not really disappointed with
the West Virginia match,” Petro
said. “All the guys were hitting
the ball well, they just couldn't
judge the wind properly, which is
an exceptionally difficult task to
perform.

“Our number one man, Mike
Hoffman, who usually shoots in the

mid-seventies, _ had an eighteen- T

hole total of 90. Our second seed,
who for this match was Scott
Martin, shot a 96. I wouldn’t say
they had very good rounds.

“It was our first outing of the
season, and I know with the talent
we have on our squad this year,
that we will have a very ﬁne year.”

As the season begins, the field of
about 20 eligible team members
must be narrowed to a traveling
squad of six or seven. “We’ll be

holding a practice session today at
Green Oaks golf course, and from
that I'll be better able to judge who
I have,” Petro said.

“We have some freshmen I need
a chance to look at, and I’ll have a
better idea of whom the team
members will be later this week._”
