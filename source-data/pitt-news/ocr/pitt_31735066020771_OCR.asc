Hillman

inherits
Leuba
library

By Michelle Kleinsak

Staff Writer

A private library valued at
$532,000 was willed to the
University of Pittsburgh libraries
by the late Mrs. Martha Leuba.

The library contains 20th cen-
tury fine press books, woodblock
prints, autographed letters and
many first editions. It is one of the
most valuable private library col-
lections to be donated to the
university since the Darlington
Memorial

Originally established by

Walter Leuba to be a ”reading
library,” the collection contains
many works of interest to the Leu-
bas. ‘Included are extensive ex-
hibits of books by and about
Thomas Carlyle, John Keats, Ezra
Pound, Jonathan Swift, George
Santyana, George Saintsbury,
Norman Douglass, T.S. Eliot,
Louise Imogen Guiney, Fredrick
Clapp and others. He ordered
many of these works from cata-
logs sent to him by dealers in
New York and England.

Also housed in the library are
the drafts and final manuscripts of
many of Leuba’s own writings.
During his lifetime, Leuba
authored or co—authored 10
books.

More than 50 of the co|lec— P

tion’s autographed letters bear
the signatures of writers such as

- Rudyard Kipling, Charles Dick-

ens, George Eliot, Sigmund
Freud, Thomas Hardy, Victor
Hugo, Sir Walter Scott, James
Russell Lowell and William Bu-
tler Yeats. _

Due to its increasing value, the
main part of the Leuba Library
will be housed in the Walter and
Martha Leuba Collection, estab-
lished in 1976, in Pitt's Hillman
Library Special Collections
Department for research
references. _

Jean Kindlin, a Hillman em-
ployee, said, ”The Leuba Library
will definitely be used, especial-
ly by scholars, because it's a
research collection.”

The date when the library will
be accessible to students has not
yet been established.

Martha Leuba died in February
of 1988, and Walter Leuba died
in September of 1985. Both Mr.
and Mrs. Leubawere Pitt gradu-
ates and employees of the State
Department.

Marathon clinic offershelp to runners

By Lisa R. Pugliese
For The Pitt News

Beginning Jan. 21, a series of
seven free clinics will be held to
better educate runners on the
training aspect for this year's Pitts-
burgh Marathon.

The Sports Medicine Institute,
operated by Presbyterian Univer-
sity Hospital and the University
of Pittsburgh Medical and Health
Care Division, will sponsor the
clinics. ’ *

The program is not aimed at

one particular sector of the com-
munity, but instead is open to
anyone who holds an interest in
marathon running.

According to Dr. Freddie Fu,
marathon executive medical
director and coordinator of the
clinics, in past years, the turnout
for the clinics has been referred
to as bad. ”We usually run in
60-150 people," he said.

”We welcome all kinds, from
older to younger people,” said
Fu.

Fu has been in charge of the

clinic since the Pittsburgh Mara-
thon began five years ago. ”We
have done it since the first mara-
thon and have been coordinating
the clinics since the very begin-
ning,” Fu said.

Covered at the first clinic will
be training schedules and gener-
al advice on running the mara-
thon. ”Who Should and Who
Should Not Run” will be covered
by Dr. Abe W. Friedman, cardi-
ologist, and ”Running in Cold
Weather” will be discussed by
marathon medical director, Dr.

David Ellis.

Guest runner Malcom East will
also speak. The clinic will be fol-
lowed by a 5K run through
Schenley Park.

All speakers and guests in-
volved in the clinics are volun-
teers and are not reluctant to get
involved, Fu said.

”What the big deal is, is that
we provide medical care for the
marathon. Some of the runners
are even sponsored by the mara-
thon itself,” said Fu.

SLIS clean presides over library organization

By Karen Speece
Staff Writer

Dean Toni Bearman of Pitt's
School of Library and Information
Science has recently been elect-
ed president of the American So-
ciety for Information Science.

According to Bearman, the
ASIS is ”a professional associa-
tion of individuals in the informa-
tion field.”

According to Bearman, the
ASIS includes people from com-
puter companies, networks, pub-

lishers, libraries and researchers.
With approximately 4,000 mem-
bers, ”it’s a fairly small profes-

sional association based in
Washington, DC.,’’ Bearman
\said.

The ASIS has committees based
in the areas of education,
research, public affairs and an in-
ternational relations committee,
she said.

As president of the ASIS, Bear-
man said that her duties include
speaking for the society, attend-
ing meetings of different chapters,

representing the association at
conferences with other organiza-
tions and setting the direction for
the organization for the year.
Bearman is also in charge of giv-
ing the committees specific direc-
tions and, of course, chairing the
board of directors.

Pitt's library of information
science is consistently ranked
among the top 10, and almost al-
ways in the top five, of the nation.
”We are the largest school of our
kind in North America,” she said.

According to Bearman, the

schools are ranked according to
the quality of faculty and the
quality of research.

”We are always in the top
ranks of those areas,” she said.
”Pitt is a leader in the information
field.”

Bearman said that the first
course ever taught in the informa-
tion science field was taught here
by Professor Kent in 1962. This

‘course introduced the concept of

information science as a field of
academic study in the late '60s.

STOCKTON, Calif. (AP) — A
man fired several dozen shots
from an automatic rifle in an
elementary school Tuesday, kill-
ing six children, wounding at

least 35. other people and then‘

shooting himself in the head,
authorities said. .

”We have at least one suspect
in custody who has a gunshot
wound to the head,” Deputy
Police Chief Ralph Tribble said.

Bruce Fernandez, spokesman
for the county office of emergen-
cy services, said six people had
died.

Ellen Rich at St. Joseph's Med-
ical Center said eight victims
were being treated there, and said
the total, including those being
treated at other hospitals, was 35
wounded.

”We have at least 30 people
that we've sent out to area hospi-

Calkins.

The attack at Cleveland
Elementary School came shortly
before noon. Other children were
kept in their rooms, said John
Klose, Stockton Unified School
District information officer.

Police Sgt. James Monk said his
office learned that a ”man went
berserk with an automatic
weapon and we [had] several
[people] down.”

”Several dozen shots were
heard from an automatic rifle,”
said Monk.

Foreign students face problems adjusting to Pitt

By Ugochi Oyoyo
Staff Writer

For graduate foreign students at
Pitt, studying abroad can be more
than an extended vacation. Pres-
sures to adjust financially, aca-
demically and socially can make
their experiences less than easy.

”Foreign students are confront-
ed with many challenges from
the start,” said Geoffrey Wood,
director of the Office of Interna-
tional Student Services. ”Not
only do they have to acclimate
themselves to the environment
and blend in with the culture of
the people,_ but they have to

master their studies as well.”
”The hardest part about being
a foreign student is the financial
part," said Xiaolin Xing, a gradu-
ate student of economics. ”The
very reason why I chose to come
to Pitt is because I got a govern-
ment scholarship for my first year
and a fellowship. -
”l was considering other
schools in Japan, China, Western
Europe, Canada and Australia.
But even though [American
schools] are more expensive,
they offer a greater chance for
financial support.” '
”One.reason why many for-
eign students would like to study

in the [United States] more than
in other countries is because the
[United States] is more flexible
and offers much [more] as-
sistance,” said Emeka Meke, a
doctoral student in vocational
and technical education.

”Another reason is that Ameri-
ca offers many technical pro-
grams,” said Meke. ”Third World
countries are especially interest-
ed in technical programs, and
America is doing more vocation-
al programs now than other
places are.

”The chances of gaining admis-
sions and scholarships are also
greater here than anywhere else.

school fees for the first year of

school,” said Meke. ”After that
year, the family usually continues
to sponsor the student until they
can get assistance.”

Academic adjustments can be
both trying and pleasant for for-
eign students. "In Third World
cultures,” said Meke, ”we deal
with subjective test questions in
school. Here, in the [United
States], learning is mostly objec-
tive. And it's often difficult for stu-

dents to adjust to this.”

’’I am really enjoying studying
here. It's very easy with [the use
of] computers, and the libraries
have many books, all quite easy
to reference,” noted Xing.

”Professors here are more open
and accessible than in any other
part of the world, which is superb
because it helps make the learn-
ing process easier,” observed
Meke. ”ln Nigeria, going to see

”There were no forests, just
buildings everywhere. And in In-
donesia, there is no spring, no fall
or winter. Day after day is
summer.”

”SociaI outlets are not so clear
for foreign students,” said Meke.
”Our families are paying for us to
go to school here, and they're all
depending on us to learn as much
as we can so we can go back and
help our governments. We have
to use a lot of self—discipline to
know when to go and see films
and attend parties and when we
have to be in the library
studying.”

”To help foreign students ad-
just to their environment more
‘smoothly, we conduct a week-

long orientation session at the
end of August, another shorter
one in January and a final one in
the spring,” said Linda Gentile,
an adviser for foreign students
and scholars.

’’In these sessions, we feature
everything from immigration mat-
ters, registration procedures,
health insurance and health serv-
ices fees, to the learning skills
program available and classroom
behavior.

”We also want to make their
social adjustment better,” said
Gentile. ”So we schedule social
affairs like a Gateway Clipper
cruise, a tour of the city, or if the
Pirates are in town, a baseball
game, during orientation.”

’Here’s looking at you, kids’ adventure in Casablanca

”Someone tried to kill us in
Casablanca.”

I looked at the Canadian wom-
an in sleepy confusion as images
of Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid
Bergman danced in my head.

It was 2 a.m. when the two
travelers, lugging huge rucksacks,

MICHELE

, QUINN  

sleeping bags and a minitent,

T’ burst into the train cabin where

I was sleeping. ,

”I’ve never been so scared in
my life,” she said, smiling at her
traveling companion.

”You said you wanted an ad-
venture,” he replied, grinning.

I sat crammed in the corner of
the cabin as they situated their
bursting backpacks and settled
down.

They were in their mid-20s,
wearing tie-dye shirts, fashiona-

. ble spectacles and wrinkled khaki

pants. They looked like extraor-
dinarily neat hippies —— their hair
trimmed, their clothes wrinkled,
but clean. I
Without an invitation, they be-
gan enthusiastically telling me all
about their adventure in

. Morocco.

”We’re lucky to be alive,” the
woman said, almost boasting.

They had been traveling
throughout Portugal, Spain and
Morocco for three months. Hav-
ing run out of money, they decid-
ed to go to Casablanca where,
they had heard, the price of liv-
ing was cheap.

On the ferry crossing the Strait
of Gibraltar, they met a man from
Casablanca.

”We thought he was really
nice! You know, you meet some
of the nicest people when you're
traveling,” the woman said.

I couldn't help but think of all
of the rotten people Imet while
I was traveling.

_ ‘The man invited them to visit u
his home in Casablanca, and over

the next couple of days, he guid-
ed them around the city. They
visited the cheapes-tshops, where
the Canadians purchased sou-
venirs.

”We thought the man was get-
ting us the best deal on the stuff,”
the man said,‘while cleaning his
glasses with a clean handker-
chief. ”Boy, were we wrong.”

By this time, as I watched the
two people tell me their story, I
really thought I had met up with

. two innocent, sweet and incredi-

bly naive travelers. I thought I
could guess the ending of their
”adventure.”

The way I figured it, these two
seemingly wholesome people
were taken in bysome two—bit

swindler. They confronted him,
he made a couple of threats
(which he probably wouldn't
have followed up on), and then
they left the country in terror.

Wrong.

The man looked at me with a
suspicious grin.

”We stole the guy’s passport,”
he said, laughing.

I realized now that I was sitting
with two suicidal maniacs. The
one thing you do not do to a
Moroccan (or anyone else, for
that matter) is steal his passport.

From what I had heard, Moroc-
can passports are hard to come
by. If you meet someone with
one, he or she is probably pretty

important or has some influential
friends.

”It was great!” the woman
laughed. ”I was standing with the
guy one day after we found out
he had been ripping us off. I
asked him ifl could see his pass-
port, and the idiot actually hand-
ed it over_.”

When he asked for it back, the
woman said they wouldn't return
it until he paid them back the
money he had swindled out of
them. , -

”The guy was marking up all of
the souvenirs we bought and
splitting the difference with the

shop owner,” the man explained.

”He started making threats,‘ but

he gave us our money back and
then told us to get out of the
country or we'd be killed.”

”Isn’t traveling great?” the
woman laughed.

Great? I would have been a
nervous wreck if I had been in
their situation.

The Canadians gave me one
more quick smile before they
snuggled together, murmuring
about how much fun they were
having.

As the train raced on toward
Switzerland, Ileaned my head
against the window and realized
I had missed out on a true ad-
venture. A

The Eagles are Grounded

Panthers avenge recent BC lossiwith 73-64 victory   

By Matt Martin

~:6$ports Editor

3*-

CHESTNUT HILL, MA. — Not
this time.

That's what the Pitt basketball
team told Boston College last
night, overcoming an 18-point
BC rally to defeat the Eagles,
73-64, before acrowd of 6,316
at the Conte Forum in a Big East
Conference matchup.

It was the Panthers second con-
secutive victory (they upset third-
ranked Oklahoma 99-91 last Sun-
day at.Fitzgerald Field House) im-
proving their record to 9-6, 2-2 in
the unpredictable Big East. The
Eagles fell to 8-6, 1-3.

”They showed a lot of charac-
ter in the end and I'm glad they
came back,” Pitt coach Paul
Evans said after watching his

agteam battle back from a 54-51

second-half deficit after enjoying
a 24-9 first-half edge.

But perhaps more importantly
than character, the Panthers
showed poise.

After allowing BC guard Dana
Barros to singlehandedly disman-
tle them with 43 points in a 95-83
upset loss January 7 in Pittsburgh,

ﬁhe Panthers defense allowed

‘ arros, the Big East's leading

scorer at 24.5 points per game,

only 15 total points, seven in the '

second half. '

”Pat [Cavanaugh] and Sean
[Miller] did a good job on Dana,”
said Evans, ”but in all fairness to
Dana, the rims here are tight.”

BC Coach~Jim O'Brien was
making -no excuses. ”We have
not shot well and Dana hasgnot

Qwot well.”

The Eagles shot 43.1 percent
for the game, Pitt, .44.9 percent.
Boston" College forward Steve
Benton and center Corey Beasley
picked up some of Barros’ slack,
scoring 13 and 12 points, respec-

' tively.

Regardless, the Panthers shut

down the single—most dangerous '

offensive weapon in the league’
with a help-out defense.

”We played excellent
defense,” said Pitt sophomore

‘center Bobby Martin, who led the

. NEWTON, Mass. — Big East
Commissioner Dave Gavitt
agreed Tuesday with George-
town basketball coach John

_ Thompson's opposition to Propo-

ﬁsition 42, a new NCAA rule that

tightens entrance requirements
for athletes.

Gavitt also said the'decision—
making process at NCAA conven-
tions should be streamlined be-
cause of the increase of proposals
and people voting on them.

”lt’s hard to track some things"
that are. voted on, he said.

el proved no longer'is_adequate to .

Panthers with 17 points and 12
rebounds. ”We made [Barros] try
to work for his points.

“We told our big guys to step
out on him,” said Cavanaugh.

While the Panthers were glad
to get out of Boston with a victo-
ry, Martin said there was another,
even more important aspect to
the outcome. \

”Now that we're 2-2 [in the
conference], we're right back in
it. I think if we lost tonight we
would have had an emotional
letdown.”

The Panthers had real reason to
celebrate after the game. Sixth
man Rod Brookin, who scored
only three points after tallying a

career-high 24 against Oklaho-
ma, fouled out of the contest with
9:28 remaining in the second
half, and forward Brian Shorter,
who leads Pitt in both scoring
‘and rebounding, played only 24
minutes due to early foul trouble.

”That really hurt with Brian
out. It got us out of our game,”
said Martin, who played the en-
tire 40 minutes and came up with
big rebounds w__hile Shorter was
on the bench.

’’I felt I had to do a little more,”
said Martin. .

”We don't have a lot of height
even with‘ Brian in there,” said
Miller, who added 15 points,
nine onthree-point shots.

Pitt still led in the rebounding
department, 34-30.

”We think we showed a lot of
character,” said Miller, ”but
we've got to continue to play
tough when it’s close.”

Character and poise are thing

the Panthers have not shown in
many of their losses, but Miller
feels that is beginning to change.

’’I think it's starting to build. It
was a great team effort to come
back against a team from the Big
East, which is always a good
victory.” '

But after leaping out to the 15
point first-half-lead, the victory
celebration was temporarily laid
to rest as the'Eagles roared back
into the game.

cope with the growth ‘of the

NCAA convention.

He called it ”a very ineffective
form of government” when
1,800 people are in a room and
147 proposals are made. ”The
present form of government
needs changing.”

Gavitt criticized Proposition 42
at a news conference held as part
of the Big East's 10th anniversary
program.

”Any rule that denies opportu-
nity to a socio-economically dis-
advantaged class of students is
not a good rule,” said Gavitt,
who visited Boston College on
Tuesday during a tour of the Big
East schools. '

Thompson walked off the court’
before Georgetown’s Big East‘

game against Boston ‘College last .

Saturday night to protest the rule“

scholarships to incoming fresh-,

men who do not have both_a 2.0
grade-point average in high

Under the current rule, Propo-
sition 48, if an incoming fresh-
man meets only one of those
criteria, he can get a scholarship

'-but cannot play as a freshman.

Gavitt agreed with Thompson's
contention that the SAT is cultur-
ally biased . against under-
privileged students. He said the
national norms on SAT tests are
904 for non-minority students
and 737, an increase of 28 over
the previous year, for minority
students. . '

If athletes don't receive scholar-
ships, they are not bound by
many NCAA restrictions. A pos-
sible loophole in Proposition 42
might allow athletes who do not

aimed at limiting boosters’ roles
in athletic programs, Gavitt said.

”Whether this [Proposition 42]
will lead to that, I don't know.”

Third—ranked Georgetown
plays Wednesday night at Provi-
dence, where Gavitt once was
basketball coach and athletic
director. Thompson said Monday
he would not ”continue to go off
[the court] every game, but I'm
going to stay off until I get some
satisfaction.”

He did not say if he would
coach against Providence.

Gavitt said he supported
Thompson's right to walk off the
court before Saturday night's
86-60 victory and Georgetown’s
right to support him.

”He probably did the right
thing if you're going to measure
it in terms of what he hoped to
accomplish,” drawing attention
to the rule and creating a dia-
logue, Gavitt said. ’’It was certain-
ly effective. Maybe he could have
chosen another form.

’’It did not appear as though the
symbolic walk had any intrusion
on the playing of the game itself.”

/\/Iasal, Sullivan spark swim teama

By Kent Hulnick

For The Pitt News

Although there are numerous
training methods that are used by
coaches, trainers and athletes, the
Pitt women's swim team believes
that it has found one that works.

At least, it has proved to be suc-
cessful up to this point. 

Case in point: two records that

1 were set by two members of the

team. On Nov. 19, at the Univer-
sity of Virginia, freshman Karin
Masal swam a 2:20.77 200—yard
breaststroke to break the previous
record held by Jodie O'Neil, set
in 1986. ln the same meet, Laura-
Lee Sullivan swam a 1:05.22
100-yard breaststroke. The previ-
ous record was set by O’Neil in
1984.

Coach David Belowich said
that these accomplishments are

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, January 18, 1989

”the latest success of the training
philosophy.” What this philo-
sophy entails is that all the breast-
strokers train together, all the
backstrokers train together and so
forth. v

”This support mechanism al-
lows for differences within the
group, but also provides for com-
radery between the swimmers,”
he added.

Masal believes that
philosophy is beneficial.

”We’re all of the same ability,
and we push each other in
workouts.”

Belowich also said that Masal
and Sullivan ”are the closest to
qualifying for the NCAA tour-
nament.”

Masal is 1.5 seconds away
while Sullivan is one—eighth of a
second from qualification. Both
swimmers think that they're capa-

the

ble of ”making the cut.”

Belowich said that these two
freshmen are ”unique individuals
who bring versatility to the team.
Their personalities also make
them an asset.

”But because they are fresh-
men they are still growing as peo-
ple,” Belowich added.

Masal, who swam in the Olym- _

pic qualifiers last summer, feels
that she can improve by ”keep—
ing a positive attitude and not
seeing things negatively]

improve ”by developing the feel-
ing that I can do well all the
time.”

And, in last Saturday's meet
against Penn State ‘(which the
Panthers won), Masal won the
200—yard breaststroke, and Sul-

livan won the 100-yard event.

Sheerer assisting Lady Panthers Pitt

By Lisa Pugliese
For The Pitt News

For the past four seasons, Sally
Sheerer has entered the Fitzger-
ald Field House as a member of
the women's basketball team.

This season, Sheerer still takes

her place on the Lady Panther‘

team; however, her role is no
longer that of a player, but in-
stead that of a graduate assistant

first season as an assistant to head
coach Kirk Bruce. ”She does
quite a bit,” said Bruce.

Already she has been involved
in scouting practices, recruiting,
preseason conditioning and help-
ing to see that practices go well.

One factor which led Bruce to
recruit Sheerer as a coach is her

”She’s a good all-around play-
er,” Bruce said. ”Sal|y’s always
been a hard worker.”

As the fifth all-time leading
scorer for Pitt, Sheerer led her
team in scoring and rebounding
as a junior, and she became cap-
tain in her senior yearwhile aver-
aging 13 points per game.

Sheerer now works primarily

with the centers and forwards:

qiuring drills. Often during prac-

tices, she gets right out on the
court with the players. ,

’’I always wanted to be out
there,” she said.

Sheerer believes the present

position as a coach. She has

Sheerer admits that it has been

brought Boston College within
three, 34-31, at halftime, and a
boisterous crowd would not let
BC forget that fact as the second
half began.

The Panthers scored seven of
the first nine points of the second
half, but the Eagles would let
them pull no farther ahead than
46-39 as Miller hit both ends of
a one-and-one at 14:01.

Boston College then scored
seven consecutive points to tie
the game before Brookin broke
the scoring drought at 9:55, hit-
ting the front end of a one-and-
one- '

A dunk by Beasley put the Ea-
gles ahead for the first time in the
game, 48-47, at 9:28.

Pitt small forward Darelle Port-

er hit two foul shots to put the
Panthers up again, but BC ran off
four straight points to match their
largest lead of the evening, 52-49.

After guard Jason Matthews’
jumpshot brought Pitt to within
52-51, Benton connected on ‘a
turnaround bankshot to give BC
a 54-51 edge with 6:54 re-
maining.

The Panthers manufactured
their comeback at this point, out-
scoring the Eagles, 22-10, over
the remainder of the period to
produce the final score. _ A

Each starter — Miller, Mat-
thews, Martin, Porter and Short-
er — scored four points in the
run, and Cavanaugh added two.

Neither team was able to get
into a flowing offense for very
long throughout the game. The
Panthers put BC on the foul line
22 times during the contest, and

the Eagles responded by hitting I‘

16 shots, a 72.7 percent clip.

Pitt hit 24 of 34 charity at-
tempts, shooting 70.6 percent.

The Panthers sense they are
back on the winning track, but
realize the rest of the teams in the
league won't lay down" for them
now they've won two in a row.

”Every night in the Big East
you've got to be ready to play or
you're going to get beat,” said
Cavanaugh.

With the league's second—place

team, Providence (13-1), Journey-

ing to the Field House Saturday
night, the Panthers feel they have

the emotional edge they need to :

attempt to regain their spot in the
upper echelon of the Big East.

’’It was a real confidence
builder tonight," said Martin.

”We got back into it and we won g .

and we'll be for
Providence.

”We’re going to be sky-high.”
