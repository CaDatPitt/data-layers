(Editors Note—This is the ﬁrst in a
series of articles on the history of the
University. Since the 150th anniver-
sary of the founding will be observed
this year, it is timely to review various
phases in University history.)

By Milton Lehman

Almost 25 years ago the Uni-
versity celebrated its 125th anni-
versary. The only record of the cele-
bra-tion of 1912 is in an official bul-
ietin published by the University fol-
lowing the" event. In 1937 the Uni-
versity celebrates the sesquicenten-
nial anniversary. ._ ,

Possibly a suggestion, possibly not;
at any rate the bulletin does tell how
the students participated in the cele-
bration of the 125th. It started out,
the bulletin claims, with a student
torchlight procession and a bonﬁr-e
on the University campus. Led by
the band, 1000 students with repre-
sentatives of the different schools and
several hundred alumni marched in
the procession.

Back in 1912 “dinks,” the tradi-
tional skull caps, and freshman haz-
Eng were in style. “The ﬁrst exer-
cise,” says the bulletin, “was the cere-
mony of burning the freshman caps,
after which a snake dance was exe-
cuted around the bonﬁre. The usual
refreshments were then served, and‘
after a number of University songs
and selections by the band, the exer-
cises of the evening were closed.”

“Usual” Refreshments?

Whatever the “usual refreshments”
were, we do not know. Possibly a
birthday cake and a wiener roast
over the burning caps, but at any
rate the bulletin gives us to believe

that there was real excitement. The
student ceremony, to be sure, was
unoﬁicial.

Formal celebration began the next
day with educational conferences, a
luncheon for delegates, and presen-

tation of a historical play by the ,

students. The conference began with
an address by Chancellor S. B. Mc-
Cormick, who welcomed representa-
tives sent by many, European and
American universities. Approximately
250 educational bodiesls-ent delegates.

In a cursory manner Chancellor
McCormick summarized the periods
of the University’s history: the only
oﬂicial recording we have of more
than a century of activity of the in-
stitution. Guest speakers followed
the Chancellor, speaking on the ideals
of education: culture, scholarship, ef-
ﬁ-ciency, and citizenship.

Lasted Three Days

The celebration lasted oﬁicially for
three days in February. Conferences
were held to discuss the “City Uni-
versity” and aspects of education with
reference to educational institutions.
Exercises commemorating the grant-
ing of the ﬁrst charter includ'd
speeches by presidents and oﬁicials
representing their schools. The cele-
bration concluded with a short ad-
dress by Chancellor McCormick, sum-
ming up the signiﬁcance of the event
and thanking the delegates for their
attendance.

For the sesquicentennial celebra-
tion next year, Mrs. Agnes L. Star-
rett, associate professor of English,
has written and compiled a detailed
history of the University. Culled
from over a hundred old ﬁling cases,
contributions of alumni and friends

sary.

Merry Old Brick

Comes Across

There’s a brick missing from a

house of the British Prime Minister,

10 Downing Street, over In Lond-on,
England. It is now in the curic col-

lection in the Nationality Rooms’ of-

ﬁce. Burt probably they aren't miss-
ing it over on Downing Street.
Mrs. Ruth Crawford Mitchell, Na-
tionality Rooms adviser, who is trav-
eling in Europe, was passing the
Downing Street house one day While
it was being repaired. She stepped
up——asked for a brick—and had i-t
sent to the University.

As bricks go, it is ordinary look-
ing, but the 200 years in Downing
Street have turned its grey color
somewhat yellow.

What ﬁnally will become of the
brick has not been determined, but i-t
is now being exhibited by Mrs. Wil-
li.am B. Doty, secretary in the Na-
tionality ofiice.

This week the_fraterniti_es. were able
to complete only ‘two scheduled
games, which were both played off
on a rain-soakedtschenley Oval ﬁeld
last Thursday aftern_oonl_i Iniuthe ﬁrst
battle the Phi Ganis,‘ "demonstrating
great offensive and.defensive power,
added another victory to make it two
straight when they’ swamped the
SAMS, 13.-0.‘ 

The Fijis scored two touchdowns
and 11 ﬁrst downs while holding
their opponents to two blanksin the
touchdown’ and ﬁrst down columns
of the" scoring sheet. Although it
wouldtbe diﬂicult to pick out many
outstanding"players‘ from the _ win-‘

ning team, Hank Sawin, the captain|

of the _,-Fijis, did stand out as the
ﬁnest player on the ﬁeld.

By virtue of three ﬁrst downs to
their enemies’ one the Phi Deltspde-_
feated the Sigma Chis in the second
tilt of the afternoon. Ne_ither team
showed "any great advantage over the
other in thishfray, the __game being

Irish met the’ Yah.,Ya;hs forthe second

This‘ ‘made ‘the third win for the
Irish, the Shamrock boys having
romped over the Yah Yahs in their’.
ﬁrst game to the tune of 26-0 and
having nosed out a 2-0 victory_over‘

the Woo Woos earlier in the fyvevek...

With the Newman Club meeting the
Trackers at 4 :00 o'clock Friday after’-’

The game was close until. Bus Ellis.

Teams Meet At Fairmont
In Holiday..Battle A

While everything will be quiet
[around Pittsburgh on Armistice Day,
th-ere will be ﬁreworks at Fairmont,
West Virginia, when the . Panther
Cubs and Little Mountaineers engage
in their annual grid tussle.

A In ﬁne shape after a victory against
Penn State fresh, the Pitt —_f»rosh.are
really up against a tough proposition
Wednesday. Outstanding among the
West_Virgin_i,3..Victories is a 18-0 de-
feat pf the~Tech_'- plebes. A ‘win, over
Potomac the preceding _week;. keeps
the West Virginian record as.unb-eat-
en and unscored on. 'It is undis‘puta-
ble‘ that they will enter the"game.=as
‘favorites. ‘ I

According to Coach “Sleepy” Glenn,-.-
‘Mountaineer mentor, there will be
twbxshifts in his starting lineup. Mor-
ris has‘ been shifted to the ﬁrst team
by virt_u__e of his good work in prac-
t,ice§,and‘Hauck, formerly tackle on
the defense and center on the offense,
will, handle only the tackle position.
If the name ,“Sleepy” is any conno-
tation of~'la'stVweek’s varsity-Fordham
tussle,‘t-he‘ frosh gridders are in fo-r
a full afternoon.

Pit-I: Lineup Unchanged

Last year at Connellsville the Mil-
ligan proteges whitewashed the West
Virginia’ 'fr—eshmen to the tune of
18-0. The Little Panthers made their
initial sc-or-e in the ﬁrst period when
Curly Stebbins plunged over the goal
line. " Daddio snared G~oldb.e-rg’s pass
in the second quarter and Clem Cam-
bal brokeloose on a 48-yard sprint
in the ﬁnal quarter to wind up the
scoring melee.

Wh7en'the yearling eleven lines up
on Wednesday Farkus.—and .Dickin-
son will ﬁll the end berths, Fol-tz and
Kristufek will hold down the tackle
positions, and Corace and Penny-
packer will ﬂank Fullerton, the cen-
ter.

Backﬁeld assignments will prob-
ably be the same as for the Penn
State game, Marie at quarterback,
Cassian-o and Pastin at halfback, and
Goo-dell at fullback.

 

Panthers Show November
Form In Crushing Lions

 

Goldberg; Stebbins, Urban‘,
Wood Star As Pitt Team
Routs State, 34-7 .

Pitt’s big football “On-again-Oﬁl
again” roulette wheel stopped, spin-
ning smack at the “On” mark. Sat-
urday in the Stadium Monte Carlo-—
a stop that ‘sent Bob Higgins and
his Penn State eleven to bedwith a
34-7 headache as their lone ‘salvage
out of the “Big Game.”

With Biggie Goldberg, Curly Steb-
bins and Johnny Wood doing most
of the effective Panther. dealing by
means of some dandy runs the ‘Suth-
erland team opened‘ its traditional
great November series and warmed
up for the intersectional battle with
Nebraska’s powerful Cornhuskers out
in Lincoln next Saturday. ‘

It took the Panthers only eight
minutes to score Touchdown No. One,
which was made possible‘ "by the Pan-
thers’ recovery of a State fumble ‘on
the Lion 26-yard ‘line. On the third"
down Goldberg slid back and"tossed'
a 30-yard pass, to Stebbins, "who
caught it just as he was crossing the
goal line. Daddio ‘converted. " " ' '

Early in the second half ‘Goldberg
started an 80-yard irnarch for ' _a
touchdown with a 45-yard jaunt and
the Cats chopped off the remaining
35. yards in short chunks, Patrick
going over. 1 '  

On the kickoﬂ’ following this touch-
down Harrison returned the ball 35‘
yards, then Wear broke away for 32
more to set the Lions‘ on the "Pitt
13-yard line. And. then " came ; one
of football’s oldest plays, the “sleep-
er” play, for the State,"touchdown._
Harrison hid out by the sidelines,
the State boyshustled into play and
Wear tossed-“Harrison a" pass over
the goal. - V" _.

A Goldberg-‘Stebbins ‘combination
earned the third Panther score. Steb-
bins trotted .39 yards,’ then Goldberg,
15, then a series "of shortslams that
had Stebbins going over from the
four-yard mark. I Two of the Pitt
subs, Johnny Wood and Johnny Ur:

ban, tallied the ﬁnal two touchdowns. .

Both were; beautifu_l broken ﬁeld
pieces, Wood. going 48 yards '*and‘Ur.—

Cross-Country, Volley Ball
Next For ‘Simon Pure’
Sports Enthusiasts

It might be 10 days or more
away but Martin J. Feely is
busy on plans for his second
annual Panther Run, -to be
staged November 19, and for
the annual intramural volley ball
tournament, to take place some time
around November 23.

Do not be alarmedif on the date
of the Panther run about 4 :30 o'clock
you should. see several young men
students, attired. in. scant clothing for
such. brisk November weather, run-
ning up .and»down the. campus hills
thatare .the bane of every.Pitt stu-
dent’s existence. They are not es-
cape-d Ilunatics, but are taking part
in Mr. Feely’s annual 'cross-country
tour of the Pitt.campus. It is open
to. all boys who are eligible for intra-
mural athletics and affords an .op—
portunity for boys interested. in
gaining.a._letter for intramural ac-
tivities to. gain points towards that
en-d.

Teams of seven men each may be
entered by fraternities or. any other
recognized campus organization and
a trophy will be awarded the team
scoring the least points. They will
be scored by adding up the number
of the place in which each man ﬁn-
ished. Lastyear Jimmy Filson took
the individual honors. while the Kappa
Sings hold the team trophy. Organi-
zations or individuals wishing to en-
ter the run should ﬁll out entry
blanks, appearing in The News.

Here's The Route

The tour will start at Gate 3 of I

the Stadium, continue around the
edge of Trees Gym Field and the
football practice ﬁeld, along Breck-
enridge Street to the Falk School,
from there down University Drive
past the Dental School and down

the Athletic Oﬁice, back to Gate 3!
and then one lap around the Stadium
track to finish up. The course is
about one mile and a half long.

ber 23 the thud of ﬁsts meeting vol-

ley balls will be heard in the evening
coming from the Trees Gym and the
Stadium courts.

These thuds will be the product of

Panhellenic Council

Posts Rusliing Rules

Formal Program To Consist
Of Tea Next Sunday,
Starting 3 O’clock

BID DAY NOVEMBER 17

N YA Students, New Women
Not To Be Eligible

Rules for fall rushing have
been issued by Panhellenic
Council to each of the women’s

fraternities on campus.

Fraternities rush formally only one
day in the fall, and their rushees are
upperclass women and advanced fresh-
men. Next Sunday is the day ap-
pointed for this year.

No NYA student is eligible for fall
rushing. Because these women need
Government aid to remain at the Uni-
versity, Panhellenic Council decided
that they should not assume the addi-
tional ﬁnancial burden of joining a
fraternity. This does not include those
women who obtained NYA work last
spring and are not working this fall.
The eligibility list for women who can
be rushed may be obtained at Heinz
House.

Panhellenic rules for rushing are:
I. General Rules:

No student may be invited to a
rushing party who has not complete-d
12 credits at the University of Pitts-
burgh; who is not carrying 12 credits
at the present time; whose grades
for the preceding semester fall be-
low a 1.0 quality point average, or
who is doing NYA work.

ll. Fall Rushing Rules:

1. There shall be one rushing
