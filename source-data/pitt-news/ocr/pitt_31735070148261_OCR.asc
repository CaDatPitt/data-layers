Man-
found

deadin
Oakland

The Pitt News Staff

A 23-year-old man was found
dead in Oakland Tuesday night,
according to the county’s medical
examiner.

The Allegheny County Medical
Examiner’s Office said the Cauca-
sian man was pronounced dead
before 9 p.m. at his residence at
3822 Pierce St. The man’s cause
of death will not be known until
after an autopsy scheduled for
Wednesday morning.

The medical examiner’s ofﬁce
said that it would not release the
man’s name until his family has
been contacted.-

University did not renew her
contract.

James Lieber, Williams’ law-
yer, said that she was ﬁred par-
tially because of her accent.

“We feel that she was treated

unfairly, in that unfortunately I

she was subjected to discrimina-
tion due to the fact that she was
not a Latin American/Hispanic
person,” Lieber said.

The complaint said that Wil-
liams speaks ﬂuent Spanish with
a European accent, taught up-
per-level undergraduate Spanish
language courses, among other
classes, and she was a “distin-
guished and well—regarded teach-
er” who consistently received
high student evaluations.

On Oct. 15, 2010, Williams
received a letter from the de-
partment chair noting that her

contract would not be renewed.

due to her “un—collegial behav-
ior.” According to the complaint,

’ Williams asked for documenta-

tion of the behavior but was not
provided with any.

Her employment was termi- '

nated onjune 30, 2011, according
to the complaint.

Lieber said that the leadership
of the department at the time was
Latin American/Hispanic and
discriminated against Williams.

The lawsuit states that. Wil-
liams is also charging discrimina-
tion ofage and ge_nder.

Lieber said that Williams is
seeking re-employment, and
if she is not granted that, then
she wants monetary damages.
He said it is too early to say how
much money she will seek.

“Ideally, she’d like to.get her
job back,’’ he said.

Lieber said that the suit was
not ﬁled until more than a year af-

ter her contract was not renewed V

on race

Mary Mallampalli
Staﬁ’ Writer

If there’s an African—American
man on television, he’s likely
run-ning down a sports ﬁeld or
running from police.

At least that’s the stance ofJa-
siri X, an East Liberty resident
and local hip—hop artist who
spoke at a summit held Tuesday
in the University Club to discuss
African—American representa-
tions in the media. ’

fessionals, journalism scholars,
researchers and news media ex-
ecutives who attended the all-
day, invitation-only event titled
“Evolving the Image of the Afri-
can—American Male in American
Media.” ‘ '

. “There’s really only one por-
trayal, or actually two: either ath-
letes or criminals,” the hip—hop
artist said at the summit hosted
by Pitt’s Ofﬁce of Public Affairs.

X founded the New Media
Academy, a program for African-
American teenagers that teaches
them how to create their own
media through the use of biog-
ging, video production and social
media.

“The coverage of African-'
American men has been very
negative,” X said. “[New Media
Academy] putsthem in a position
to narrate their own story.”

Negative portrayal in the media

Summit 4 1

said that the purpose of the event was “to
identify evidence of the problem of [the]
negative image of young black males in the
news media” and discuss solutions.

“We want to evolve the portrayal of
young black males to fair, accurate and
balanced,” Hill said. 1 » ‘-

The summit included anumber of dis- 1‘ -

cussions between young adults, professors
and media executives on-tlielportrayal of
the African-American man in the media.
Marc Lamont Hill, an associate profes-
sor of English education at-the Teachers
College of Columbia University and host
of the TV show “Our World With Black
Enterprise,” was featured as the event’s
keynote speaker. _

George Curry, president and CEO of
George Curry Media, led a group of three
African-American media executives in a
discussion about the role of the black press
in-today—’s world.

Curry began the discussion by stating
that there are 3.3 million African—Amer-_

- icans in the New York City metropolitan

area, yet there are fewer than 25,000 sub-

-scribers to African-American magazines

and newspapers.

Together, the executives discussed the
‘many challenges that black media faces
today, including the lack of subscribers to
African-American newspapers and maga-
zines in urban areas such as New York.

“Advertising has been extremely hard to
get for African-American magazines,” said
Pamela Newkirk, a journalism professor
at New York University. “When African-
Americans do serious journalism, circula-
tion drops. There’s not a support system
for African-American news. People say
they want serious news, but as soon as
you give it tothem, there goes the circu-
lation.” V

Tene’ Croom~,~ former news director for
American Urban Radio Network, said that
part of the problem is the lack of African-
Americans in the newsroom. -

“You’ve got to put people in the news-
room who look like the people you want
to cover. You can’t only have European-
Americans,” Croom said. “It’s not a prob-
lem of the black press, it’s a problem of
the press.” I — r

Board breaks precedent

Michael Ringling
Staﬁ‘ Writer

Pitt‘Women’s Volleyball Club B-Team re-
ceived some bucks at the Student Gov-
ernment Board meeting Tuesday night,
breaking a Board precedent.

The Board voted against the Alloca-
tions Committee’s recommendation to
deny the club team’s allocation request
to send the 12-member B-Team to tourna-
ments at Ohio State and Michigan along
with the A-Team. After deliberation with
the club, the Board approved the $1,358
request in full.

“I really appreciate everything they
have done for us in the past, and this mo-
tion,” said Paige Lloyd, president of Pitt
Women’s Volleyball Club. a -

The Allocations Committee initially
recommended that the Board fund only
the nine—member A—Team’s trip to at-
tend the twotournaments, in line with
the precedent set by the Board to fund
only A—Teams’ events. The committee

recommended to approve $704 and deny "

$654.-

Lloyd said during the deliberation
that her group provided the funding for
their own jerseys at a total of $1,575. Cur-
rently, Pitt Women’s Volleyball Club does

not receive funding through SGB -for its 1

“We put in the effort to ask for as little
as possible,” she said.

Board member Alex Zimmerman moved
to amend the motion to approve the re-
quest in full. Board members Matthew
Riehle and Laurenjentleson voted against
the motion, but the motion still carried
with six votes.

“This year’s Board has set a very seri-
ous precedent. At the same time, we want
to enable organizations,” SGB President
Molly Stieber said. She said that the orga-
nization fundraised for purchases that the
Board would usually fund, like the jerseys,
and so “that being said, it was worthwhile
to break that precedent.”

' Lloyd said that she was unaware of the
precedent set by SGB to fund only A-Teams
and said that she will no longer apply for
funding for B—Teams. 2 -

Board member Riehle said - that. he

“I have voted against=‘B-Cfeamsaimiihe

ture, SGB can possibly cover the costs
for jerseys.” V .

Also during the meeting, Board mem-
ber Emily Hoover invited students to at-
tend a Meet the Candidates event in Mar-
ket Central on Nov.-14 from 5 p.m. until 7
p.m. The event will be an informational
session for students to learn about the
presidential and Board candidates run-
ning in the Nov. 17 SGB elections. Students
can cast their vote from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.
on that date.

Colleges neglect
state systems

If you’re an out-of-state college
student, you’re in high demand."

The Chronicle of Higher Edu-
cation reports that public uni-
versities are ramping up their
out-of-state student recruit-
ment. These students. not only

‘bring geographical diversity to

a campus, they also pay higher
tuition rates than their in-state
counterparts — something very
desirable to public schools that
are receiving less and less support
from the states, proportional to
tuition rates.

This report follows a recent
Inside Higher Ed survey that says
universities increasingly select
students based on their ability
to. pay. According to the survey,
more than half of the admissions
oﬂicials at public research uni—‘
versities and more than a third
at four-year colleges say they’ve
increased their efforts to recruit
students who can pay full price
for college with no ﬁnancial aid.

' The survey of 462 admissions di-

rectors and enrollment manag-

ers was conducted from August

to early September. ‘
Essentially, a student’s aca-

demic qualiﬁcations are being

pushed aside in favor of his or her
ﬁnancial status and the money
he or she willultimately give to
the university. We can’t help but
think, is this really happening?

The fact is that state schools
need to recruit out-of-state stu-
dents and givethem preference
over in-state students for their
bottom lines. And the states’ na-
tionwide budget cuts to higher
education are mostly to blame.

Arguably, this is not a bad pro-
cedure for schools to undertake in
the name of academics. Presum-
ably, schools will have to improve
their resources and make them-
selves worth the extra money in
order to convince out-of-state stu-
dents to attend. This could bump
up the importance of research,
increase the quality of professors
and add improvements to facili-
ties to make for better learning
environments.

But if this trend continues,
what’s the point of having state
schools in the ﬁrst place?

Imagine if everyone in Penn-
sylvania attended schoo_ls along
its border — West Virginia, Syra-

cuse, Rutgers, Maryland and Ohio ‘

State would be contenders — and
the students from those states
attended Pennsylvania’s state

schools. It seems strange then, to.

involve, state governments’ money
in something that no longer ben-
eﬁts their residents.

Back in Abraham Lincoln’s
day, the land-grant system was
installed in each region, and thus
was the inception of the state

‘ school system. But this «study

shows that those same schools
no longer cater to their in-state
students and instead.choose to

-focus on money.

‘Solutions to a problem like
this all stem from correcting the
seething volcanic eruption that
is the price of higher education.
Universities are in trouble, and
the recruitment of out-of-state
students is a consequence of the
poor condition of the system
as it stands. Solving the inﬂat-
ing tuition problem seems to be
the most desirable way to ﬁx the
struggling state of higher educa-

' lIl0Il.

What we think wouldn’t be a
good idea is further regulation
of the admissions choices that
‘schools make. Determining a quo-

‘ ta of out-of-state versus in-state

students would sacriﬁce academic
quality even more so thanschools’
current procedures do.

It seems like schools are doing
what they need to in order to stay
aﬂoat in an economy that increas-
ingly neglects higher education.
But this most recent consequence
of student preference is unfair,
upsetting and preventable.

We just have to hope universi-
ties’ future endeavors will focus
on academics and not cash ﬂow,
and that the government will real-
ize the importance of improving
this rotten state of higher educa-
tion. I

THE MOUSTAOHE COLUMN OF AMERICA

Moneyball applies to life

Oliver Bateman
Columnist

From what we’ve heard, you’re
probably one of the nicest guys
or girls in town. People drop what
they’re doing, put down their
Nintendo DS handheld consoles
and leave their Occupy Pitts-
burgh tents to tell you how nice
you are. Forthe most part, being
the nicest guy or girl in town is
the way to go. But when playing
niceball ceases to enable you to
hit home runs or ace your mid-
term examinations, it’s time to
consider a superior alternative:
moneyball. ,

If you haven’t seen the criti-

cally acclaimed film based on
the critically acclaimed book of
the same title, “Moneyball” tells
the story of what happens when
Hollywood pretty boy Brad Pitt
takes over as general manager of
the hard-‘luck Oakland Athletics.
Faced witha challenge almost
as steep as the one we assumed
when we chose to redeem the
woebegone Cleveland Browns in
Madden 2o12’s dynasty mode,
Pitt does what any golden-
hearted cutie pie would do un-_
der similar circumstances: He
hires a fat geek to cdmpile some
statistics, crunch afew imaginary
numbers and then moneyball the
heck out of Mr. Connie Mack’s
White Elephants. How does that
work out for them, you ask? We’d
like to say that the A’s go on to
win 15 consecutive World Series,
but we won’t because we actually
have no idea what happens. Don’t
spoil it for us, though —- we love

to be surprised, and we’re still-

chomping mad about how our
friends ruined that legendary
pie-humping scene in “American
Pie” for us.

Anyway, the point of this ‘

extended introduction is that
moneyball is the answer to any
problem you can imagine, sports-
related or otherwise. Take our
aforementioned Browns fran-
chise, for example. The cup-
board was bare'when we seized
the reins. Colt McCoy? Is that
some sort of malt_ liquor accom-

paniment for a romantic evening _

with a half-dozen of Pittsburgh’s

most gorgeous $5 pizza pies? And
Peyton Hillis? Man, if EA fans
hadn’t voted to put his picture on
this cover, we wouldn’t know Jack
(Bauer, because he always saves
the day) about this tortoise-slow,
overrated halfback. It almost
goes without saying that this is
a terrible team, but because we
despise Hillis we’re going to say it
again: This is a terrible team.‘
Following Brad “Sexiest Man
Alive” Pitt’s example, we decid-
ed to moneyball our way out of
that deep hole. We clicked over
to the transactions screen and
began trading our worst players
for much better ones. When Dal-
las bristled at swapping McCoy
for Tony Romo, Dez Bryant and
three future first-round picks,

we just did what any competi- '

tive moneyballer would do and
selected the “force trade” option.
After some spirited wheeling and
dealing, our team was soon com-
prised of top stars like Michael
Vick, Lesean “Shady” McCoy,
0.]. Simpson, Cam Newton (we
used the game’s player editor to
“supe him up” to a stellar 99 rat-
ing, which seemed fair enough),
Randy Moss, Terrell Owens,
Jerry Rice and Casey Hampton.
No matter how forcefully clue-
less old-timers like Hall of Fame

DanielleHulSlall'Illusu'aLm .

second basemanjoe Morgan are
willing to argue the merits of

. smallball, there’s not a chance

in heck that scrappy smallballers
like McCoy and Hillis could com-
pete with our “dream team” ‘of
moneyball studs.

But can moneyball work out-
side of Madden? You bet your bot-
tom dollar — and we only make
safe bets because every dollar
counts when you’re moneyballing
— it can! Let’s consider that NBA
lockout everyone isn’t talking
about these days. Real bummer,
huh? There’s no way the greedy
owners and the lazy, overpaid
“max contract” players are ever
going to come to terms, right?
Wrong! Once both sides hire a
fat geek and have him commence
with the moneyballing, profes-
sional basketball will be back on
TV, Lakers shooting guard Kobe
Bryant will be back to bricking at
least a dozen “treys” a game and
we will be back to not watching
hoops for any longer than the
split second it takes us to switch
to that episode of “Dance Moms”
we’ve been saving in the DVR.

There’s more, though: Re-
member that big midterm in the
lecture class you’ve been skipping
all semester on account of your
various ﬂus and other excuses?

You don’t? Yeah, there’s an exam
next week. Check the syllabus
if you’re not sure. No, sorry, we
don’t have a copy of the syllabus.
Anyway, syllabi are beside the
point, because you won’t need
to study once you get down to
moneyballing. Just ﬁre up your

wvu files lawsuit
against Big East

Tegan Hanlon &
Lauren Kirschman
‘ Contributing Editors

v West Virginia University filed

suit against the Big East Confer-
ence Monday, less thanaweek
after announcing its move to the
Big 12 Conference.

In the lawsuit, West Virginia
claims that the court should ex-
empt WVU from the Big East’s
mandatory 27-month waiting

period because the conference .

“failed to fulﬁll its fiduciary ob-
ligations” toward the university
by not maintaining an eight-to-
eight ratio between football and
non-football schools, not ‘pro-

tecting West Virginia’s interests
as a member of the conference
and not sustaining a high level of
competition in the Big East.

The filing comes four days
after WVU accepted an invita-
tion to join the Big 12, and the
suit could have implicationsfor
Pitt’s conference move and the
continuance of the decades—old
sports rivalry between the two
universities.

The complaint, filed in
Monongalia County Court in
West Virginia, alleges that Big
East Commissioner John Mari-
natto also ‘took a payment from
WVU that the university offered

Pitt recruit Shell shines

Dustin Gabler
Staff Writer

As the Pitt football team heads
into the ﬁnal games of its season,
the next generation of Panthers is
preparing for high school playoffs.
Here’s a look at the top performanc-

°es from Pitt’s 2012 recruiting class
and the players whose high school
careers ended this week.

Graham has received a verbal
commitment from 18 players so far
for the 2012 football season.

Rushel Shell — Running Back
— Hopewell ‘

Shell, Pitt’s highest ranked ver-
bal commit (No. 45 nationally on
Rivals.com), had another domi-
nating performance in a big AAA
Parkway Conference showdown. A
loss would have ended the Vikings’

. season, but Shell wouldn’t let his '

team miss the playoffs. He ran for
212 yards on 35 carries with four
touchdowns on senior night at Tony
Dorsett Stadium in Hopewell, Pa.
‘Shell now sits at 8,541 career yards,

496lyards shy of the state record.
His performance Friday night was

' his 38th straight game with over

100 rushing yards. The future Pitt
running back needs a 100—yard
game in the ﬁrst round of the play-
offs to break the national record for
consecutive 100-yard games.

Dakota Conwell — Quarter-
back/Linebacker —— Upper St.
Clair _ ' I

Conwell committed to the Pitt
Panthers as a linebacker, but he
has been dominant as a dual—threat
quarterback this season for the Up-
per St. Clair Panthers, an AAAA-

powerhouse team. His Panthers .

matched up against their South

_ Hills rival, Mt. Lebanon, for the V

Great Southern Conference title.
In a game that featured a future Big

' Ten lineman on both teams, Con-

well’s performance was the most
impressive. He rushed the ball for
276 yards and three touchdowns
and led his team to its ﬁrst confer-
ence championship since 2006.

GREGORIAN RANTS

Oakland once the place to go for a

Greg Trietley
Senior Staff Writer

Most locals knowthat the Pitts-
burgh Pirates once played on
what is now part of Pitt’s Oak-
land campus. Every fall, on- the
anniversary of Bill Mazeroski’s
World Series—winning home run,
fans return to the outfield wall

of "Forbes Field to listen to the-

game’s radio broadcast and cel-
ebrate the Pirates’ past.

But there was another Pitts-
burgh Pirates team that played
in Oakland back in the day: the
National Hockey League’s Pi-

A rates, which existed from 1925

to 1930.

In fact, until the construction
of Mellon Arena, Oakland was
the best place in town to catch a
hockey game. It’s a zany history
ﬁlled with trolleys, an ammonia
leak and a bicycle club.

The story starts in 1893. Pre-
sumably rolling in a sludge—caked
bundle of smelted cash, the city
built the Chuck E. Cheese’s of its
day, a multipurpose facility that
featured both a theater and an
ice rink.

The Schenley Park Casino —
which sounds like a recruiting
violation — stood at thecurrent
home of the Frick Fine Arts Build-
ing. Home to political rallies,

hockey game in Pittsburgh  

winter carnivals and a day care
center, the extravagant building
had oil paintings hanging in the
ice rink’s dressing rooms.

The place was a palace. It'had
luxury boxes and, as the New-
burgh Daily Journal put it in
1896, “a modern and ﬁnely ap-
pointed roof garden  at cost of
$45,000.” The New York Times,
not one to editorialize, wrote
that, “the Casino wasconceded
to be the ﬁnest of its kind in the
world.” It had everything but an
actual casino.

As Oakland reveled in its ex-
travagant rooftop garden and lacy
dressing rooms, the Keystone Bi-
cycle Club, made up of students
from Carnegie Tech and the North
Side’s Western University of Penn-
sylvania, decided it didn’t like bi-
cycles anymore. So the club gave
up bicycling, renamed itself the
Pittsburgh Keystones and played
hockey at the Casino on Saturday
afternoons.

By 1896, the four-team West-
ern Pennsylvania Hockey League
was operational, featuring teams
from Duquesne, WUP and the
Pittsburgh Athletic Club, as well
as the home “Casino” team, ac-
cording to a 1901 article in the
Pittsburgh Press.

WUP wouldn’t change its name
to “Pitt” for another 12 years.

MCT Campus

Flash forward to an empty X
Casino in the pre—dawn hours of’

Dec. 17, 1896. According to a New
York Times article so old that it
spells the city “Pittsbu_rg,” an am-
monia cylinder in the ice machine
under the rink exploded. The re-
sulting ﬁre devoured the Casino,
burned the bridge to Schenley
Park and melted the windows of
Phipps Conservatory.

No one died in the inferno,
but without a rink, the WPHL
dissolved. Casino manager Harry _
Davis told the New York Times
that “the Casino will be rebuilt at
once,” but he was then unaware
that his $540,000 building was
only insured for an eighth of
that amount. It was never recon-
structed.

Enter politician Christopher
Magee. Perhaps realizing that
trolleys were on the way out, he
purchased a trolley barn at the
corner of Fifth Avenue and Craig

Street in 1895, turned it into a 
5,000-seat arena and named it

Duquesne Gardens.

“It’s going to be a bad 100
years for trolleys,” Magee prob-
ably said at some point. “But it’s
a great day for hockey.”

The building hosted its ﬁrst.“

hockey game in 1899. By 1901,
the WPHL was back, a half-mile

WVU seeking exemption

from Waiting period  

Lawsuit 4 5

in exchange for being allowed to leave the '

Big East immediately. The lawsuit also
states that WVU is seeking monetary dam-
ages lost as a result of mismanagement by
Big East ofﬁcials, including Marinatto.

After Tuesday’se annual meeting of Big
East Conference presidents, Marinatto is-
sued a statement in” response to the suit.

“In light of the lawsuit ﬁled by West-
Virgin-ia yesterday, the presidents also
discussed and conﬁrmed our continuing
commitment to enforce the Conference’s
27-month notiﬁcation period for schools
choosing to leave,” he said.

“The Conference believes these claims
to be wholly without merit and will explore
all its legal options to protect its interests
and to ensure that West Virginia lives up to
its obligations,” Marinatto added.

Marinatto also said that the presidents .
“-voted unanimously to extend invitations

to specific institutions, including both
football-only’ and all-‘sport members to
join the Big East Conference.” .
’“‘s"'I‘hee'commissi‘oner said he plans ‘to
speak ttfreﬁresentatives from the select-
ed schools shortly. .It is among the first

public moves that the’ Big East has made ‘

to expand since Pittsburgh and Syracuse
accepted invitations to the Atlantic Coast
Conference in September, causing the Big
East’s football membership to drop to six
while it’s non-football membership re-
mained at eight.

Pitt Athletics spokesman E.]. Borghetti
declined to comment on West Virginia’s
suit. - ’ _ . l
The Big East also previously allowed
Texas Christian Uriiversity to withdrawal
from the conference without waiting 27
months, the lawsuit states. TCU accepted
an invitation to the Big East in 2010 and,
before ever playing a game in the confer-
ence, accepted an invite to the Big 12 in
October.

Since the Big East failed to hold TCU
to the 27-month waiting period, the law-
suit claims that West Virginia shouldn’t
be required to delay its move to the Big
12 either. i .

The lawsuit states that the “lack of
leadership, breach of ﬁduciary duties by
the Big East and its commission and vot-'
ing disparity between the football and
non-football schools resulted in .the Big
East football conference no longer being
a viable and competitive football confer-
ence.” - h V ’

“West Virginia and other Big East schools
as well believe that the Big East Conference
will stand to lose its status as an automatic
qualiﬁer for the Bowl Championship Se-
ries, the suit claims. .

West Virginia spokesmanjohn Bolt said
that West Virginia does not have any com-
ment on the lawsuit at this time.

*“It speaks for itself,” he said of the
suit. I. ‘

Oakland old

Hockey 4 5

north of its old Casino home. Although
the Keystones folded in 1904 (perhaps
to take up biking again), the WPHL soon
boomed to include local teams like the
Bankers — which was comprised entirely
of bankers.

By 1925, Oakland had an NHL franchise
in the Pirates, which had formed from the
remnants of the United States Amateur
Hockey Association’s Pittsburgh Yellow

Jackets. The Pirates made the playoffs in ,

their ﬁrst season, but the stock market
crash of 1929 hit them hard.

Since Duquesne Gardens was much
smaller than other NHL rinks, the team
moved to Philadelphia after the 1930 sea-
son with an intent to move back to Pitts-

’ burgh once a new arena was built. That,

though, wouldn’t happen for 30 years, and
the franchise officially folded in 1936 after

hockey hub

one season as the Philadelphia Quakers
and a ﬁve—year hiatus. »

‘ Franchises and, eventually, leagues
came and went as years passed at the Gar-
dens. The Pittsburgh‘ Shamrocks formed
in 1935, joined the International Hockey
League, played one season, ﬁnished fourth,
lost $36,000 and folded. More success-
fully, the Detroit Olympics moved to Pitts-
burgh in 1936, became the Hornets, moved
to the American Hockey League — which
still exists — and played at the Gardens

A for 20 years until the day it closed.

That day came in May of 1956, when the
dilapidated facility was unceremoniously
razed to build an apartment complex that
still stands. The neighborhood of Oakland
has lacked anindoor rink since and has yet
to regain its once-undisputed status as the
hub of Pittsburgh hockey. I

Voytik’s high school
season ends

— Cleveland (TN)

Voytik, selected by ESPN as an Elite 11
quarterback this summer, saw his historic
high school career come to an end last Friday.
His Blue Raiders went into the game knowing
that they needed to win — and other teams
needed to lose — in order for the team to go
on to the playoffs. The four—star quarterback
led his team to a victory, but the Blue Raiders
didn’t get the help that they needed from the
other teams and did not make the playoffs.
In‘ his ﬁnal game, Voytik threw for 296 yards
and four touchdowns. Friday’s performance
put him above 5,000 career yards.

Chris and Demitrious Davis —— Wide

The twin brothers and receivers played
their ﬁnal high school game for the Falcons
last Friday in a 14-0 defeat. Both receivers
possess incredible 4.4 40-yard dash speed
and are prototype Todd Graham slot receiv-
ers. Chris Davis, who is ranked No. 28 in the
