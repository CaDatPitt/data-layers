’°s UNIVERSITY or PITTESBGURGHT

-9

By Scot Ross

News Editor

No talk of aid to the Contras or
of Irangate. No mention of bud-
get cuts to higher education or
the millions of homeless.

None of the controversy of the
19805 was present in the Oval
Office during last night's farewell
address by President Ronald Rea-
gan; rather, the speech merely
signified that the country's eight
years of going ’’Dutch’' 7 are
almost over.

. Reagan carried on last night
what NBC's Tom Brokaw de-
scribed as a ”personal conversa-
tion” with the American people

he has governed.

’ ”|t’s been the honor of my life
to be your president,” Reagan
said. ”Nancy and I are grateful for
the opportunity you gave us to
serve.”

With the Jan. 20 inauguration
of George Bush around the cor-
ner, Reagan took time to back his
vice president. ”...action is still
needed. If we're to finish the job
of ’Reagan’s Regiments,’ we'll
have to become the ‘Bush
Brigades.’ And he'll need you ev-
ery bit as much as I did.”

Reagan reflected on how he
believed he helped America
through the tough times of the

, 19805. ”We held together during

some stormy seas and, at the end,
together we're reaching our des-
tination,” he said.

He credited his administration
with two ”great triumphs”: ”One
is the economic recovery, in
which the people of America
created and filled 19 million new

‘jobs. The other is the recovery of
our morale. America is respected
again in the world and looked to
for leadership.” ‘

Reminiscing about changes he
made to resolve the recession,
Reagan mentioned the critics of
his economic policy.

”The fact is, what they called
radical was really right. What
they called dangerous was just

Reagan urges Bush support in fare well address

desperately needed,” he said.
”And in all of that time, I won a
nickname: ‘The Great Communi-
cator.’ But I never thought it was
my style or the words I used that
made a difference; it was the con-
tent. I was ‘the Great Communi-
cator,’ but I communicated great
things and they didn't spring full-
bloom from my brow; they came
from the heart of a great nation.”

He called his term ”The Great
Rediscovery,” adding that it was
a rediscovery of values and com-
mon sense.

”We cut the people's tax rates,
and the people produced more
than ever before. The economy
bloomed like never before,” Rea-

gan said.

Reagan recounted his dealings
with the Soviet Union. While its
administration took leaps toward
peace, he was quick to point out
that the communist government
of the U.S.S.R. is very different
from our own.

”We must keep up our guard,
but we must also continue to
work together, to lessen and
eliminate tension and mistrust,”
he said. ”What it all boils down
to is this: I want the new close-
ness to continue, and it will as
long as we make it clear that we
will continue to act in a certain
way as long as they continue to
act in a helpful manner.”

Pitt chosen site for multi-million dollar EPA project

By Theona Stefanis
For The Pitt News

.3 The U.S. Environmental Protec-

tion Agency recently selected the
University of Pittsburgh's Applied
Research Center in Harmarville
as the’ site for the National En-
vironmental Technology Applica-
tions Corporation.

The purpose of this new multi-
million dollar effort is to acceler-
ate the commercialization of
priority environmental technolo-

. gies that are being developed by

‘Q;

government and the private
sector.
According to Samuel A. Schul-

hof, associate vice president of.

applied research at Pitt and direc-
tor of NETAC, the project will at-
tempt to identify environmental
technologies being developed or
already in existence and deter-
mine whether they are feasible
for industry.

Researchers will conduct a risk
assessment of each particular
technology to determine if that
technology is ready for the mar-
ketplace.

Said Schulhof, ”There are a lot
of good technologies out there
that aren't being used or de-
veloped.”

NETAC will provide a means
through which a promising form
of environmental technology can

be brought into the regulatory
process. ltwill be NETAC’s job to
bridge the gap between the
regulatory requirements of the
EPA and the needs of industry.‘

Schulhof said he is confident
that NETAC will speed up the
commercialization of important
forms of environmental tech-
nology.

Pitt was selected for the $9 mil-
lion cooperative agreement be-
cause of its reputation for
effective cooperation with local
business and industry. Moreover,
the state of Pennsylvania is cen-
trally located in the nation's
northeast industrial belt and is the
fifth-largest producer of

hazardous waste.

Finding solutions to the
problems of environmental pol-
lution is a major concern of area
researchers. Funds for the project
will be matched by a variety of
contributions from public and pri-
vate sector sources.

N ETAC is an outgrowth of the
Federal Technology Transfer Act
of 1986, which Congress passed
to encourage the formation of
new information sharing organi-
zations involving both the
government and the private
sector.

The project comes at a time of
expected high growth in the en-
vironmental technology market.

Last year, U.S. industry and
government spent nearly $80 bil-
lion for pollution abatement,
compliance and control, up 6
percent from 1986. The cost of
cleaning up the nation's hazar-
dous waste sites is estimated to
be more than $200 billion over
the next 20 years.

EPA Administrator Lee Thomas
has praised Pitt and the city of
Pittsburgh, saying that both have
”hands—on, can—do people.” He
said that NETAC will ”develop,
create and facilitate new technol-
ogy.  We can take the best of
innovation and help commercial-
ize it and get it into the market-
place and into our communities."

Pennsylvania utilities rate cha

WASHINGTON (AP) ~— The
Supreme Court Monday handed
state officials and consumers a
big victory, ruling that two Penn-
sylvania utilities may not recover
from electricity customers the
costs of four abandoned nuclear
power plants.

The justices said states have
broad power to set rates that
balance the interests of utility in-
vestors and the public. The Con-
stitution does not require that
states allow utility companies to
rec_over from their customers all
”prudent” investment, the
justices said.

By an 8-1 vote, the justices up-
held a ruling that bars the Penn-
sylvania companies from billing
electricity customers for $50 mil-
lion invested in the abandoned
plants.

Chiefjustice William H. Rehn-
quist, writing for the court, said,
”The Constitution within broad
limits leaves the states free to de-
cide what rate-setting methodol-
ogy best meets their needs in
balancing the interests of the util-
ity and the public.”

Rehnquist rejected arguments

that Pennsylvania regulators un-
constitutionally confiscated the
utilities’ property when they over-
turned a previously approved rate
increase to cover the costs of the
abandoned plants.

The court upheld a provision of
Pennsylvania law that instructed
utility regulators on how to set
rates.

Number of workers
tested for drugs low

WASHINGTON (AP) —- Only
one American worker in 100 was
tested for drug use last year, the
government said Wednesday, an-
nouncing a study that sharply
reduced previous estimates of
how many employers conduct
such tests.

For job applicants, the chance
of being tested was four times
higher than for workers already
on the job, the Labor Department
survey of 7,500 employers
showed.

The survey, conducted last
summer, found that only 3 per-
cent of all employers had drug-

indecent assault cases.

  PERSPECTIVE

responsible for crimes

Thedeath penalty inspired more controversy yesterday
when the Supreme Court heard arguments in the case of
Johnny Paul Penry, a convicted murderer and mentally

retarded man on death row.

Lawyers for Penry claim that executing a mentally retard-
ed man violates the Eighth Amendment’s prohibition on
cruel and unusual punishment, and therefore, the death
penalty should not apply to such cases. A Texas jury,
however, thought it was appropriate.

”Cruel and unusual punishment” refers not to the exe-
cution of a criminal who committed a cruel or unusual
crime, but rather to a punishment which does not fit the
crime. An example of a cruel or unusual punishment
would be the castration of an exhibitionist, or the execu-
tion» of a shoplifter. Sentencing a man to death for a vio-

lent crime, however, is neither cruel nor unusual.

Penry was convicted of raping and murdering Pamela
Moseley Carpenter in her Texas home and was sentenced
to death in 1980. Penry was tried and convicted accord-
ing to due process of the law. His guilt cannot be down-
played because of his handicap, just as a non—handicapped
person cannot claim ignorance of the law as his excuse.

|f’Penry’s sentence is overturned on the sole basis of
his handicap, there is every indication that this could cre-
ate unclear boundaries outlining the relevance of a killer's
mental capacity. Such matters vary with everycase.

Assuming too much

I am a teaching fellow at the
Hispanic department here at Pitt:
I was shocked to read your arti-
cle of Jan. 9 called ”Visiting both
(?) sides of Mexico.” First of all
because, yes, I am Mexican, but

gives name to the desert that not
only covers most of Sonora, but
which also extends into New
Mexico and Arizona. It even
touches a small part of California.
By the way, most of the cacti you

jumped on the wagon and went
straight.

This tale would almost bring
tears to the eyes if the people and
the circumstances‘ involved
weren't totally absurd. Barry-
more’s mother said she felt like
other mothers when_their chil-
dren start growing up: she felt she
had to give Drew more room to
live.

More room! God, allowing
your 9-year-old daughter to
smoke cigarettes and go to bars
would bring social workers to the
house in minutes. If Drew hadn't
been a ”movie star,” she proba-
bly would have been whisked off

 

More room means giving your
kid the option of eating her peas,
not letting the twerp swipe your
VISA and head to Los Angeles to
hit the club scene. The mother in
this case must have been on the
same drugs as her preteen not to
notice that her young daughter
had given up Saturday morning
cartoons in favor of hanging out
with the local burnouts until two
or three in the morning.

The problem here, however, is
that everyone seems either
shocked or amused that such a
thing could have happened to

would be able to notice the smell
of cigarette smoke or alcohol on
somebody, especially an I 1-year-

old kid. What kind of an idiot '

doestit take to ignore such obvi-
ous evidence that something is
going wrong?

Dorm residents need freedom“

  

JASO
HILLMAN

Boston University recently
decided to draw up some rules of
conduct for its campus dorms.
Starting next fall, overnight guests
must be of the same sex or mem-

parent)?
Problems such as excessive

-noise and students inviting girl-
friends or boyfriends to their‘

rooms and then throwing their
roommates out do exist. And
these new rules are effective in
solving these problems, especial-
ly the latter one, but at what
expense? ’

College is one step away from

the real world, yet BU won't let

its students bring in guests of their
own choosing. Of course, unless
all the dorms in Boston are sin-
gle sex, chances are the rules
won't be effective anyway. But
that is not the point.

My two years at Pitt have been
just as much a learning ex-
perience outside the classroom as
inside. I learned what it was like

with that rule.

BU President John Silber, in a
U.5. News and World Report ar-
ticle, said, ”One has a childish
view of adulthood if he believes
being an adult means to live

‘without rules.” Well, while there

are certainly many rules to be fol-Q‘

lowed when one is an adult,
none of them has to do with
whom“ you bring. up to your
room. Obviously, Mr. Silber does
not believe students have the
ability to handle the responsibil-
ity that adults do. .

One surprising note to this sto-
ry is that manystudents around
the country support tighter restric-
tions on student conduct. Com-
plaints by students and their
parents were the impetus for the
new rules at BU. Almost 50 per-

MINDYS
BOFFEMMYER

We've become accustomed to
stories about the Student Govern-
ment Board, Morton Downey Jr.
and Jay Katz. But a few new
topics have made the news late-
ly. Among them, assaultand date
rape on campus.

Obviously, these are two very

Cdisturbing topics. That goes,

-..Women have no desire to be

without saying. But I've noticed

' something that makes them even

more disturbing — the attitudes
some people have when discuss-
ing an incident of rape or the as-
sault of a woman‘. '
. It seems inconceivable, but I've
actually heard people making
comments like, ”They deserve it
for being stupid enough to go out
with the guy to begin with.” Dur-
ing the past week, I heard a few
morons say, ”They probably pro-

’ voked it — led the guy on.” And

I heard one subhuman individu-
al say, ”Women want to be
raped. They ask for it.”

-These vile and repulsive in-
dividuals shrugged off ‘my dis-
gust, replying ”I was only
joking.” I guess they think that in
a humorous vein, their comments
are less offensive.

As far as I am_concerned, they
are desperately wrong.
There's nothing even vaguely

humorous about a woman being
raped or assaulted in any manner.
Is it possible, even conceivable,
that \people are still walking
around with the attitude that
women are subservients, to be

treated as the property of any

male who wishes to stake a
claim? ~

I don't have my eyes closed to
the world around me. I do real-
ize that there are many crazed
people in this world with ideas

even more twisted than these (if

that's possible).
What surprises and sickens me

V is the number of these people

one can find on a college cam-
pus. You see, I've been operating
under the‘ misconception that in
order to be admitted to a univer-
sity, a student has to possess
some degree of intelligence. But
suddenly that doesn't appear. to
be the case. A

Let me, as a woman, set the

record straight a bit. Women
have no desire to be assaulted or
raped. In fact, many women -
myself included — would soon-
er be murdered brutally.

Every woman I know lives in
fear of the thought of being vio-
lently victimized.

Right now I'm asking the mo-
rons who have been making the
jokes I mentioned to use the
minds that somehow got them
into college to try and conceive
of something: Imagine being at-
tacked by someone — a stranger,
or worse yet a person you trust-
ed enough to spend an evening
with. Imagine someone forcing
himself upon you — deciding that
he had some-right, due to brute
strength, to do as he pleased with
you and your body. And you, be-
ing physically weaker, had no
power to stop it. No one was
around to hear or help you. You
were defenseless against the vio-

The dangers of chemical weapons for all

Hypocrisy in the White House,
nothing new right? But it seems
that Mr. Reagan has made an art
of it. What Reagan says and what
he doesare so different that it's
hard to believe.

Here is a list of a few things that

‘Ronald Reagan has said concern-

ing chemical and biological
warfare during his term. After tak-
ing office, Reagan said that he
would abide by the 1972 treaty
that banned virtually all chemical
and biological weapons. In Au-
gust of 1987, his administration
said that money for the develop-
ment of chemical weapons
would not appear in the budget
until at least 1990. In his final ad-
dress to the United Nations this
past fall, he said that the United
Nations must fight the ”terror” of
chemical warfare. I

Makes you feel pretty safe,
right? It would, except that his ac-
tions speak louder than his
words. In -1981, the budget allot-
ment for biological weapons was

MICHAEL
SMITH

_  
-$15 million. By 1986, it had

skyrocketed to $90 million. In the
current budget, he has allotted
$17 million for the development
of chemical warfare. In three

years, this allotment will be ap- ’

proximately $100 million.

I have a question that I would
like to propose to the president:
If you are abiding by the T972
treaty, then why are you pouring

taxpayers’ money into the de-_
velopment of chemicaland bio- _

logical weapons? .

For the past two weeks, Reagan
has been screaming about the
evil Libyans and a chemical plant
that might be , producing
weapons. Maybe Reagan thinks
that if he yells loud enough about

_ other nations’ violating the treaty,

then no one will notice his chem-
ical stockpiles growing larger and
more dangerous.

The development of chemical
and biological weapons is wrong.
It is--wrong for Libya, Iraq and the
Soviet Union to use them, and it
is wrong for the United States too.

Why should mothers all over
the world have to worry that their
children will be bombed by
typhoid, anthrax, or mustard ‘gas
while playing on their play-
ground? Why’ should American
farmers who live near these

chemical weapons production
plants worry that a leak will kill
their livestock like a leak did in
Utah in 1968?

'That incident involved nerve
gas which leaked from an Air
Force research plant resulting in
the death of several thousand
sheep. Had the winds that day
been blowing in a different direc-
tion, the citizens of Salt Lake City
would have awakened to a dead-
ly cloud descending on their city.
Only recently has the govern-
ment reimbursed the farmers for
theirdead livestock.

The United States is always
claiming to be the leader of the

free world, but this past week, ‘.

while our European allies met in

Geneva to condemn chemical.

warfare, Reagan sat at home hop-
ing to get a bigger chunk of the

assaulted and raped“

lent actions of a lunatic.

Aside from the physical harm
done in this type of a situation,
imagine your mental and emo-
tional pain and horror.

Do you think you would feel
safe walking around alone? How
do you ‘think you would feel

about dating or sleeping with

someone after that?

I don't think it takes a fanatical
feminist to realize the vulgarity in
joking about rape. -It seems hor-
ribly obvious to me that there
isn't a single thing to laugh at in
a situation as ugly as this.

The other point I'd like to make
is probably even more apparent.
A lot of frightening things seem
to be happening on our campus
these days. Please be extraor-
dinarily careful.

countries

budget for the development of
these illegal weapons.

The Soviet Union has recently
made plans to scrap its chemical
and biological weaponry. It is
time that the United States fol-
lowed suit. Acid rain is bad, but
yellow rain kills.

Local power-party bands have wishes for the new year

By Joan Kane
Staff Writer

My back seat driver first swore
meto secrecy, and then he direct-
ed me to the hideout. My mis-
sion, which I had accepted while
reveling in a drunken stupor, had
been hazily outlined: compile a
coherent story out of the ram-
blings and witticisms of some of
the area's more prominent rock
musicians. That's relatively
speaking, of course.

I drove up the dark, private,
tree—lined drive and parked across
from the infamous mansion —
the ”Delta Force” hangout as it's

referred to. I'm not too sure who
lives there — a mixture of those
creative musician types, I believe.

Jerry Goldenson, drummer for
I 1th Hour, greeted us at the door
and ushered us into the library.
The dim lighting, fireplace and
shelves of books gave the room
a warm but almost eerie at-

mosphere.
Soon, we were joined by Scott
Blasey (The Clarks), Rod

Schwartz (11th Hour) and Kirk
Botula (The Affordable Floors). I
knew just from the surroundings
that this wouldn't be a run—of-the-
mill interview.

And I- was right. It was more
like a fireside chat, minus the fire.

Schwartz curled up at the end of
the couch, Botula sat cross-
legged on a table, Blasey
stretched out on the floor, and
Goldenson and manager Mike
Whited sat comfortably back in
their chairs. Meanwhile, I
twitched nervously, crossing and
uncrossing my legs. I wasn't sure
what we were going to talk
about

A big topic for discussion
turned out to be the Pittsburgh
music scene. Unlike many other
local musicians, these guys had
no, well almost no, complaints.

”Nobody owes anything to lo-
cal music. Radio stations don't
owe it to us to play us,” Schwartz

said. ”We appreciate the support
we do get. We appreciate those
people who come out and sup-
port local music.”

«The rest of the group nodded
in agreement. '

”Yeah, we just wanted to say
thanks,” Botula added. ”and we
especially want to mention and
thank Dave Cohen. Can you print
that?”

I shrugged my shoulders.

”Please print his name, be-
cause if you do, we get a bottle
oflack Daniels and a case of Roll-
ing Rock,” Botula explained.

(I'm still wondering what I get
for actually writing that down.)

”Unfortunately,” Schwartz

mused, ”The people who hear all
the complaints are the people
who support us. The people who
really care about local music read
the articles on local music, and
what they read is that no one is
supporting local music. And
that's untrue.” _

I wondered about the people
who complain about the lack of
enthusiasm for local bands. Ob-
viously, they’ve never gone to an
all-ages Affordable Floors show.
Obviously they’ve never had a

15-year-old girl scream ”-Kirrrk! I i

love you!” in their ears. Trust me,
this type of thing goes on.

Whited explained that most of
the complaining was done by
bands that weren't working
together with other bands and by
bands that were backstabbing
each other. This year, a lot of that
changed.

”A lot happened this year.

‘Older, established bands got

together and played with younger
bands. The Clarks and 11th Hour
played with Joey G., for instance.

stabbingare defunct now, too.”
After we exhausted the music
scene, we toyed with the idea of
discussing politics, but that
would have been too dangerous.
We thought about making
predictions for 1989, but no one
wanted to go out on a limb.
A retrospective of 1988 was
too original.
|nstead,the guys compiled their
”Wish List” for 1989 (These are
in no particular order):
1) To play the Underground Rail-
road in Morgantown, W.Va.
2) For a Pittsburgh band to get
signed to a major label
3) To see Rob Hertweck’s dark
blue telecaster reappear
4) To see Rolling Rock reappear

at (jraffiti

5) To see a band win a competi-
tion and actually get their prize
6) For people to get off Dan
Quay|e’s back

7) To not have to do interviews
that deal with the Pittsburgh mus-
ic scene, but rather that deal with
the music

8) For people to stop reliving the
'60s

9) To see a further polarization of
political attitudes

10) That skinheads should
represent themselves as taller
people

ll) For more people to break
Geraldo’s nose

l2) For people to have rides
home from my parties

l3)To have three more wishes.

”The Swiss '78 Tours,” a similar
kaleidoscope of images. This is
followed by ”When the Bats are
Quiet,” a shady film noir snippet
from Brazil.

The first real marvel of the col-
lection is Dutch animator Paul

Tinkerbell-sized Grim Reaper.

As the Writer scribbles, his sto-
ry comes to life on the page.
Death walks onto the page, en-
tering the medieval world of the

comes cryptic. What’s exciting is
how Driessen constantly manipu-
lates space and perception with
his bleak figures.

Bill Kroyer’s ”Technologica|
Threat” depicts an office full of
white—collared hounds being
replaced by machines. The story
is an inside joke because that's
exactly what this film does: it
combines conventional anima-
tion with computer generation.
Unfortunately, the filmmakers put
a lot more effort into technology
than the story. Sound familiar?

The American ”Technologica|
Threat” represents this continent,
along with Canada's ”The Cat
Came Back,” a fluffy romp which
turns macabre at the end. These
two entries are the most violent
and conventional. In contrast, the
European offerings tend to be

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, January T2, I989

The best of the claymation en-
tries is ”Augusta Kneading,” one
of a celebrated ”Augusta” series
from Hungary. A frowning lump
of clay tries to make bread and is
thwarted by chickens leaping out
of eggs, exploding dough, etc.

The tournee ends with the
quiet, graceful ”The Man Who
Planted Trees,” by the prize-
winning Canadian artist Frederick
Back. This is by far the longest of
piece, lasting 30 minutes.

As a young man, the tale’s nar-
rator (the voice of Christopher
Plummer) meets a mysterious
peasant who is planting oaks in
the barren French Alps. The nar-
rator visits the old man over the
span of two world wars and sees
the oak forest rise out of oblivion.

By the time of peasant’s death, he
has created a mini-Eden.

”The Man Who Planted Trees”
is a radical departure from the
cunning, adrenaline—charged feel
we associate with the word ”car-
toon.” It is based on a short story
by Jean Giono. Some might ac-
cuse it of being a bit plodding.

What's amazing though is the
intense art quality of the anima-
tion. You can sniff out a whole
range of painting influences: from
creepy Goyaesque faces to spar-
kling impressionist landscapes.

There are plenty of clever
goings-on in the tournee. But it is

efforts like ”The Writer” and ®

‘~’The Man Who Planted Trees”

' that are expanding the bound-

aries of animation.

‘SHOWCASE Soundings A

Violent Femmes
3 _
Slash _

After more than three years of
solo excursions, Violent Femmes
have reunited. If their new LP 3,
their fourth record, is any indica-
tion, their time apart was well
spent

The Violent Femmes’ last al-
bum, I985’s The Blind Leading
the Naked, sounded uninspired,
overproduced and generally
muddled. 3 is a return to form,
full of powerful, well conceived
songs and stripped down to the
spare, acoustic sound that made
the band's first records so af-

fecting.

3 is no artistic cop—out, though.
With just guitar, bass and a
washtub snare drum, the Violent
Femmes create an emotional
roller coaster with the song cycle.
The trademark romantic angst of
their first LP is still evident in
songs like ”Dating Days” and
”Foo| in the Full Moon” butwith
more sophistication and internali-
zation of blame than before.

Songwriter Gordon Gano
branches ‘out far beyond that, too.
His exploration of religious
themes continues (”Lies,” ”See
My Ship”); his humor shows
(”Fat”) even when. his narrator's

frustrations run high (”Mother of
a Girl”), and he sizes a world
view down to a personal level
(”Wor|d We're Living In”).

The fact that, despite their solo
ventures, bassist Brian Ritchie
and drummer Victor DeLorenzo
turn all the songwriting over to
Gano seems a testament to the
quality of the pieces.

The instrumental support the
two lend brings out just the right
emotional tone to Gano’s slash-
ing (yes, even on acoustic) guitar
work and distinctive creaking-
hinge singing. The Violent
Femmes sound excited to be
playing again, and they sound

more than ever like a band.
This is the album Violent
Femmes aficionados have surely
been waiting for. The acoustic
sound is back, enthusiastic play-
ing abounds, and Gano’s songs
are tighter and tougher than ever.
No matter how long they take be-
tween records, Iet’s hope this
band is back to stay.

Dinosaur Jr.

IfJimi Hendrix and Neil‘ Young
had a kid, J Mascis would have
come out. With his laconic—style
vocals on top of his noisy, ener-
getic guitar,J has given the musi-
cal trio hailing from Amherst,
Mass., a sound all of their own.

‘When they released You're Liv-
ing All Over Me, I did not think
it could be tapped, but their next
and latest effort, Bug, has done an
even better job of contrasting J's

mellow melodies with Dinosaur _ '

Jr.’s vigorous energy and blend-
ing them together into a noise
that makes the earth shake.

With the exception of the last
song, ”Don’t,” which seems to
be afiller at the end of the ‘record,
every song on this release is great. ..
If their last album did not, then
this onehas established the band
as an SST powerhouse. Bug gets
my vote foralbum of the year.
Buy it and you will be a better
person for it.

Scrawl
He's Drunk
Rough Trade

This determined trip from
Columbus first burst Onto the
scene last year with their debut
album Plus, Also, TOO, released
by a record-store owner On the
No Other label. As their first ef-
fort on a large independent label,
He's Drunk doesn't rock quite as
hard. Instead, the album shows
more variety and maturity in
songwriting on the part of the
band.

Scrawl gave themselves a
tough act to follow. Plus, A/so
TOO garnered almost universal ac-
claim from alternative music crit-
ics, who recognized that the
record was practically the only
evidence seen last year that wom-
en could honestly rock and roll.
Scrawl was a breath Of fresh air
compared to the jangle and shim-
mer Of the legion of overpro-
duced, pseudo-folksy waifs.

Forceful tunes, such as ”I Can't
Relax” and ”SIut,” were the true
expression of uptight suburban-
girl angst. The simple harmonies
and mincing guitars Of Marcy
Mays, Carolyn O’Leary and Sue
Harshe .created the sound of a
rare Midwestern power trio that
didn't copy Husker Du. Scrawl
carved out their own niche in
Ohio and created instant fans na-
tionwide. ’

Unfortunately, the pressing of
their first LP was small and distri-

.. bution limited, making it difficult

to find in stores and rare on ra-
dio. Until very recently, CMU’s

 

WRCT was the orfly local station
to play P/us, Also, TOO.
However, Scrawl was on the
move. Rough Trade picked up On
the buzz about the first LP and
made short work of signing them,
thereby concentrating the same
promotional might as the label
has behind groups such as the
Pixies and Wolfgang Press. And
it worked — He's Drunk has be-
come a staple of college radio,
and Scrawl the darlings of Spin

magazine.

The overall sound Of the group
took a turn for the diverse.
Though there are still anthems
like ”Major MinOr” and ”Creen
Beer” with emotional lyrics, they
don't bowl you-Over. Others are
slower, as if three years in a band
had sensitized and slightly mel-
lowed the members.

Maybe it's a more pronounced
country influence — the record
includes a lovely cover of
”ROckytop” — Or perhaps it's just
a simple desire to explore new
ground.

The main problem seems to be

  
   

olumbus, Ohio's power trio, Scrawl, niether jangle nor bangle.

THEPITT NEWS, Thursday, January I2, I989

that the heartland territory has
been sufficiently mapped out by
their neighbors, American Mus-
ic Club and Gibson Brothers.
Still, Scrawl is to be preferred
over those others because they
rock. He's Drunk rocks. It's that
simple.

Downsiders
All My Friends Are Fish‘
Black Park/Mammoth
I hate to make this comparison,
but it is necessary, so I'll make it
as politely as possible: The new
Downsiders record is great for
those of

us -who wish R.E.M.

   

would have never polished their
sound.

All My Friends Are Fish should
not, however, be confused with

the dozens of records that imitat- C

ed the above mentioned Geor-
gians’; it is a super disc On Its
Own. With two guitarists in the
band, the Downsiders’ music is
intricate as well as rOckIn’.: The
songs ’’I Wanna Drive”and
”Pony Made of Ice” have both
the arpeggioed and power-
chorded Rickenbacher sound.
The Downsiders formed in Chi-
co, Calif., in 1984 and played

Whatever the case, this particu-

that has no art pretention but
plenty of heady noise and dis-
sonance, usually has a male front-

man, and this is somewhat"

refreshing.
Victory Acres is the tighter side

They're rounded out with
psychedelic organ by Chris Kirk-
wood of the Meat Puppets.
joke Flower is a little more self-
indulgent and sometimes annoy-
ing, but still has plenty of sparkle.
The 11 songs are blocked into

about four larger tunes. Mary's
topics range from fundamentalist
Christians, A—bombs as phallic
symbols, and the walking dead.
All in all, the record is super
cool listening, but don't be fooled
by the big ”...of the Meat Pup-

pets” on the sticker.

Beyond the music on this

confused about what this record
is. Each side seems to be a
separate record by a separate
band, each with different musi-
cians surrounding the core of
singer Mary Clark and bas-
sist/guitarist Dan Clark. Hence
the two different titles. .

Apparently the band, whatever
its name, has either gone through
many confusing personnel
changes, or it has had many,
guests in on recording dates.

Pitt can't overcome
powerful Georgetown
squad in 76-57 loss

as,

C:

..

By Matt Martin
Sports Editor

LANDOVER, MD — It had
been nearly four years sincea
Paul Evans coached team lost two
games in a row, and something
that had never happened in his
two and a half, year tenure at Pitt,
a streak that both Evans and his
Pitt Panther basketball team were
proud of.

But the Georgetown_ Hoyas_

proved last night that all good
things must come to an end,

pummeling the Panthers. 76-57 «

for their 100th career victory at
the Capital Centre, before a
crowd of 13,878 in the Big East
Conference match-up. -

7 Pitt fell to 7-6 overall, 1-2 in the '

Big East, while seventh ranked
Georgetown improved to 11-1,

. 1-1 in league play.

’’In the first half we just got in-
timidated offensively. We got a
couple of shots blocked and it
just got us out of our offense,”
Evans said after watching Pitt

’ shoot a mere 30.4 percent from

1

. \

the field. ”Defensively, we
played fairly. We stayed with

‘them (on the boards.’ In the se-‘

cond’ half they just‘ wore us
“down.”

 Although neitherteam domi- '1

hated the first half, the Hoyas
held what would be an insur-
mountable 30-19 half time lead
on 13 of 31 shooting. Freshman
center Alonzo Mourning also
blocked five first half shots for the
Hoyas.

Pitt shot 41.7: percent for the I

game, Georgetown 50.9‘percent.
Evans expected Mourning to
‘dominate defensively. What he

did’ not 'expect’wasthe play of

6'7” sophomore forward » John

Turner, who scored a career-high
18 poi_nts and grabbed '11 re-
bounds.

Turner had been averaging 7.6
points and 7.2 rebounds.

”Turner was terrific,” said
Evans. ”He really hurt us.‘We
knew Mourning was going to be
good. We knew we were going
to have to keep him off the
boards, Turner mismatched us in
the zone on the weak side,” ad-
ded Evans, noting that Turner had
a three inch height advantage
over Pitt small forward Darelle
Porter.

‘'1 just have been waiting for
him to get going," said Geor-
getown coach John Thompson.

Evans had been concerned
about the turnovers that the

Hoyas pressuredefense might‘

cause, but the Panthers had little

4 problembreaking the full—court

press Georgetown imployed.
Still, Pitt committed 14 first half
turnovers and 23 overall. Geor-

‘ getown had 12 turnovers.

The Hoyas, noted for their
quickness and defense in recent
years utilized their front court for
35 points and got sevenpoints,
nine rebounds and three assists
and three blocked shots from
their bench.

”Their inside game is a lot,  3

more establishedthan ours right
now,” said Pitt sophomore center

.Bobby Martin, who had eight

The Panthers found the ball, and the game, out of reach against a powerful Georgetown team.

Lady Panthers lose to Syracuse,
79-72, despite-Iohnson’s 39 points

By Ed Kuznik 1
Staff Writer .

_ The Pittsburgh »women’s
basketball team continues to

_ struggle invthevearly portions of

Big East play, as they were defeat-

ed by Syracuse 79-72 last night"

at Fitzgerald Field House.

Lady Panther head coach Kirk
Bruce's crew lost their third
straight Big East game and their
fourth consecutive contest over-
all. Pitt skidded to 8-6 on the sea-

V son (1-4 in the Big East), while

Syracuse improved to 9-5 overall
(2-2 in conference play).

All of this despite the fact that
Pitt star forward Lorri Johnson
tied a school record with 39
points on the evening, equaling
the point total of Wanda Ran-
dolph in a 1976 game against
Mercer College.

”Lorri would trade thirty nine

after the game.”There’s no ques-

. tion in my mind.”

The juniorAll-American candi-
date started out on fire for the
Lady Panthers, burying an assort-
ment of long jumpers, three of
which were three—pointers, to
score fifteen of the first nineteen
points that Pitt scored. _

; She cooled off‘ slightly after
that, and perhaps not by coinci-
dence her team faded as well,

‘succumbing to Syracuse pressure

and losing control of-the game in

the later part of the first half.

”l just felt it,” she said. ’’I was
fighting hard because I really
wanted to beat Syracuse. We're
fighting off a slump and those
would have been a good win for
us coming off those losses.’’

The Orangeman started
smothering rebounds as the half
went on, and got numerous se-
cond and third chances on offen-
sive shots throughout the entire

of those for a victory,” ‘Bruce said

game. Rebounding has been a
deficiency under _the 1988-89
edition of the Lady Panthers, but
perhaps never was that facet of
the game such an integral factor
in a Pitt loss.

Syracuse banged the boards -1 7
more times then Pitt, outrebound—
ing the hosts 48-31. Included in
that total was 25 offensive re-
bounds. ,

”You can't have.a team get
more offensive rebounds than
defensive ones and expect to
win," Bruce stated. ”And then
what happens is we foul on the

second shot. The ball kept getting

tipped tonight and they kept get-
ting it - that's a very demoraliz-
ing thing.”

In the second half, Pitt method-
ically battled back, and a Johnson
lay-upshot underneath brought
her squad within six (56-50) with
over fourteen minutes left.

From there, however, the two
teams seemed to be able to do
nothing but trade buckets the rest
of the way, with Pitt trying to
break Johnson free to hit treys,
most times unsuccessfully.

Loss of players won’t
really hurt Panthers

People are starting to leave
the Pitt football team. Whether
this is a good sign or a bad sign
won’t be ful-ly known until
next season, but it does give us
a few insights.

. Two quarterbacks (Larry

' Wanke and Alex Van Pelt) are

the biggest departures. All _of
them would have been
battling for the backup job this

~ spring and fall; only Wanke

was at a great disadvantage.
VINCE  
CAREY

Wanke has two years of
eligibility left. Starter Darnell
Dickerson will be a junior next
season and he shows no signs
of faltering. So Wanke’s deci-
sion to bail out has no real
bearing on the team, except
that there is no ”experienced”
backup right now.

The thing is that Wanke real-

. , ly didn't have that much ex- '

perience. He wasiinjured at

much of a factor last season. _
Dickerson was a durable
player last season (he was hit
many times but was never in-
jured enough to sit out a long .
time), and there is no reason’
to believe that Wanke would
be any type of factor next
season. _ ’
Van Pelt is the most curious
departure. He still has four .
years of eligibility left (after be-
ing redshirted last season) and,
in all likelihood, will be the
starter when Dickerson leaves
in two years. V
He wanted to play now.
That is where the problem lies,
the same as Wanke. Pitt is cur-
rently trying to make an option
offense to better take advan-
tage of Dickerson’s skills.,
Van Pelt, like Wanke, is a
drop-back passer and probably
felt that he wouldn't fit into an .
option offense. If Pitt was will-
ing to change the offense for .
Dickerson, why wouldn’t.it
change it for Van Pelt?

The reason has to be that Pitt _ 9

Deidra Baker is hungry. She's
really hungry.

But her appetite will have to
wait for the 1989-90 basketball
season.

Baker, the Pitt women’s basket-
ball defensive standout (during
the 1987-88 season), who al-
ready missed the '88 part of the
1988-89 basketball campaign
due to academic ineligibility, is
ready to get back on the court.

”I’m hungry to play,” said Bak-
er. ”I wanted to play so bad this
year.”

But, according to Pitt head

coach Kirk Bruce, Baker will not
play the remainder of this season
in order to save her last year of
playing eligibilty.

”We don't want to rush her
back,” said Bruce. ”The only way
to keep her academics up, I think,
is to sit her out, and then we
won't have this problem next
year.”

Baker's grades are already com-
ing up, and she shouldn't have
any trouble getting back onto the
roster next year. With Baker's ath-
letic ability, she shouldn't have
much of a problem finding her
way back into the starting lineup.

”There’s nothing Deidra can't

do athletically because she works
so hard,” said Bruce. ”There will
be a spot for her next year, but
Deidra will be the first to tell you
she's going to have to earn it
back/’

Baker is excited and also a lit-
tle thankful to be getting a chance
to play next year.

’’I can't wait. We have a lot of
good athletes coming in,” said
Baker. ’’I’m just happy the
coaches and everybody else in-
volved are giving me another
chance to play next year.”

But Baker will also continue to
contribute as much as she can to
the team this year. Baker still

practices with the team and
makes her teammates play
against her tough defense.
’’People ask me why I practice
so hard when I'm not playing,”
said Baker. ”|t’s because I want
to; I love to play basketball.”

Baker also sits with the team
during home games which, ac-
cording to Coach Bruce, adds to
the success of the team.

”She’s always into it on the
bench; she's a great cheerlead-
er," said Bruce. ”She inspires the
other girls.”

Denise «Becher, who played
with Baker for two years at Hil-

bert Junior College, agrees that
Baker is still part of the team but
would like to see her on the
court.

”I was disappointed when I first
heard she wouldn't be playing
this year," said Becher. ”I think
we'd be a better team. She's not

just a scorer, she's everything. I
would rank her defense in the top
10 in the country.”

But Baker said modestly that
she wouldn't have made a great
impact on the team this year.

”I would be a help,” said Bak-
er. ”But I would just be another
spark. There's a lot of sparks on
the team.”

Track star Ellis feels at home while racing

By Steve Gaydos

Staff Writer

The wondrous athletic talents
of Pitt track star Albert Ellis have
carried him to competitions all
over the United States and
Canada.

Ellis speaks with great en-
thusiasm about one area of the
country in particular — Iowa and
Nebraska.

”The people reminded me so
much of home,” he said.

Home for Ellis is in Durham,
N.C. _

”In the South, everything is
more friendly; you make eye con-
tact with anybody [and] whether
you're white or black, they're go-
ing to speak, start a conversa-

tion,” Ellis said.

Ellis has seen very little in his
year and a half at Pitt that warms
him as the laid-back hospitality of
the South does. He admits he has
had trouble adjusting. ‘

”I have problems dealing with
the people up here,” Ellis said.
”l’ve looked people dead in the
eye and they have not said a
word.”

Lee McRae was the person
most responsible for landing the
talents of Ellis at Pitt. A

”We’re very close,” Ellis said.
”We have the same godmother.”

It was also McRae who lit Ellis’
desire to run track over playing
basketball.

”The first time I met Lee, I had
a basketball in my hand and Lee

was at the track right next to my

V house,” Ellis said. ”He called me

names, he called me a punk. He
said I should be running.”

The following summer, Ellis
embarked on his track career,
which ended in Durham with his
being named MVP of his track
team and a high school All-
American in the intermediate
hurdles.

Since then, Ellis has been prov— (
ing himself in competition with_

some of the best runners in the
country and in the world. When
the top U.S. track athletes, aged
I9 and under, gathered in Syra-
cuse for the Junior National
Championships, Ellis won the

high hurdles and finished second .

in the intermediate hurdles. E

llll Sports, llll Year]

From there, Ellis went on to the
Junior World Championships,
where he finished third in the
hurdles. Ellis also ran in the
Olympic trials and said that the
1992 Olympics are definitely in
his future plansalong with the
World Games coming up this
summer.

The calm, relaxed smile that
appears on Ellis’ face so often
these days was not seen as fre-
quently last year when he was a
freshman.

”| used to be upset all the time,
I had a terrible attitude,” Ellis
said. ”I used to worry about ev-
ery little thing from my fingernail
to my eyelash.”

Now Ellis realizes he can be
confident in his abilities.

”| just said, ’Hey it can't be this

race, whatever happens is going

Always one who has hated sur-
prises, Ellis says he has developed
the ability to know where he is
going to place in a race before the
race even starts.

”It’s hard to warm up when I

know exactly what spot I'm go-
ing to be in when the race is over.

As Ellis continues to improve as
a runner, the little voice will start
telling him that he is in first place.

’82 loss still Basketball
'’ lingers with

old Cincy
players

By Joe Kay
AP Sports Writer

CINCINNATI — The Super‘
‘G5 Bowl is more than just a second

NFL championship game for a
handful of Cincinnati Bengals. It’s
a sweet second chance.

Seven Bengals are particularly
thankful as they pack their bags
this week for'Miami and a Super
Bowl appearance against the San
Francisco 49ers. They're all that
remain from the 1981 team that
lost to San Francisco 26-21 in Su-
per Bowl XVI in Pontiac, Mich.
Receiver Cris Collinsworth,
cker Jim Breech, guard Max
Montoya, tackle Anthony Mu-
noz, defensive end_ Eddie Ed-
wards, linebacker Reggie
Williams and backup quarter-
back Turk Schonert have learned
in the last seven years how elu-
sive Super Bowl glory can be.

The disappointment over the
Super Bowl XVI loss was tem-
pered by expectations that it was
the first of many title game trips
for the Bengals. The intervening
years have made the loss harder
for the seven veterans to accept,
and made the chance at another
Super Bowl appearance feel like
a godsend.

”There are so many variables

...§involved in reaching this point

that it's unbelievable,” Montoya
said. ”Just to get another shot at
it, that's indescribable. I look at
other guys who played 12 years,
14 years and never even got a
shot at going to the Super Bowl,
and here I am, fortunate to be go-
ing to my second one.”

The seven veterans didn't quite
realize how high a mountain

Q.they’d climbed in 1981, when

the team set a club record with
14 victories and beat San Diego
in the AFC Championship game
to earn the only other Super Bowl
appearance in the franchise's
history. . '

That year, receiver Collin-
sworth was a rookie star whose
youthful innocence wasn't shat-
tered when the Bengals’ second-
half rally fell short in the Pontiac
Silverdome.

”I remember coming off the
field saying, ’I’m so disappoint-
ed.’ But I remember looking at

‘J some of the older guys, the Jim

LeClairs and the Glenn Camerons
and some of the guys that I knew,
and I remember thinking this may
be their last chance and feeling
worse for them than I did for any-
one else,” Collinsworth said.
”I said, ’Shoot, I'll probably
play in another four or five Super
Bowls before I'm finished with
this team.’ And here it is seven
.. years later,” Collinsworth said.
5 ’’I’m probably the happiest of
anybody to be going and [getting]
that second chance.”
Collinsworth and Munoz were
among four Bengals voted to the
Pro Bowl after- the 1981 season.
Munoz has earned return trips to
the Pro Bowl every year since.
The Bengals hadn't even come
close, to a Super Bowl return un-

E-\' til this season.

. ”It’s been a long dry spell,

seven years,” Munoz .said.,”It’s_,
' nice _to be going-back.”

evening.

”Darel|e did a great job. He
took it in and went up with two
hands and gets a foul, but Brian
[Shorter] goes in with the ball out
in front of him, and you are not
going to get anything good out of
that,” Evans said.

Shorter, the 6'6” sophomore
forward, had team highs in both
point and rebounds‘, with 16 and
seven, respectively.

As for his own team, Thomp-

A son was mildly satisfied. ”We

were supposed to beat Pitt at
home,” he said. _
Evans had nothing but praise

for the Hoyas.

”They’ve got some kids on
their second team that would be
playing a whole lot of minutes for
us,” Evans said.

Senior point guard Charles

Smith led all scorers with 19%
points in 35 minutes, becoming

the 24th Hoya to score. over
1,000 points. He has 1,018.

While Smith was embeddinmg H

himself in the Georgetown record
book, the Panthers were having
trouble just finding the basket.
Pitt was even with Georgetown
only once, on Shorter’s fast break
conversion that tied the game at

’2-2 at 19:05.

The Hoyas went on a 15-4 run
for a 17-6 lead at 12:57.

The Hoyas led 30-19 at
halftime.

Georgetown went up by as
many as 23 points, 61-38, at 7:29
of the second half, and the Pan-
thers could get no closer than 14
after that.

Sophomore guard Jason Mat-
thews highlighted the second half
for Pitt, scoring ten points includ-
ing two on his first career dunk
off a steal at 5:04. Shorter scored
14 second half points.

With the two game non-losing
streak gone, Pitt has its sights set
on their match-up with No.3 Ok-

lahoma at Fitzgerald Field House A

on Sunday. The Sooners are the

third top ten team Pitt will have .

played since Jan. 4.
”You never want to lose three
games in a row,” said Martin.
’’It could bethree [losses] in a

_ row,” Evans said pessimistically. ’

(John Enright contributed to this
article).

Pitt center Bobby Martin and his teammates couldn't do much against the Hoyas in last night's game.

Women-

‘three-pointer for everybody,”

Johnson said. ”For me, personal-
ly, I just get a feeling for those.
I try to put them up there some-
times and it doesn't work out.”

When the dust had cleared

4 from the battle, it was obvious

that if Pitt could have came any-
where near Syracuse in the re-
bounding department, they could
have come away with a victory
against one of the premier teams
in the Northeast.

\ According to Bruce, however,
improving that vital stat could be
easier said-than done.

”We’re really fighting that right ,
now,” he said. ”Rebounding is
not the glamour type of word.
The way the game is structured
now scoring is the glamour word.
But in my book it all begins with
rebounding.

’ ’’If I were a football coach l’d
place a great emphasis on

‘defense. I'd be saying that you

win the game by stopping the
other team, and I honestly be-
lieve that here too. I'm not one
to say that we have to score over
80 points to win a game. If we
can hold a team under 70 we
have a good chance to win —
that's the way that I look at it. _

”But you can do everything in
the world to the kids except hyp-
notizing and it may not work.
Whatl told the kids is that it has
to come from the heart. They
know the proper technique of
boxing out and things like that,”
continued Bruce.
