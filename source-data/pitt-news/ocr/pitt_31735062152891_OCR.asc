i“WANT LIBRARY BUILDING.

1 Administration Appreciates the

Co-operation of Students in
the Matter of Increased Fees.

 

Embodying in his talk a review of
the past school year and outlining the
general nature of the changes at the
University for next year, Chancellor
McCormick took advantage of his last
chance to address the students at gen-
eral assembly last Friday morning.
He predicted that in the course of the
coming year one and perhaps two new
buildings will be added to the campus
group. Of these, the proposed School
of education building will be started
as soon as the governor conﬁrms the
state appropriation made for that pur-
pose.

He said in part: “This has been a
good year—-one of steady progress.
I wish to congratulate those who are
able to say that they have done their
best and I extend good Wishes for
the summer with the pleasant change
that it brings. .

In speaking of the ‘beginning of
building operations he said: “The
Trustees are conﬁdent that the appro-
priaﬂion jwill be authorized by the
governor permitting the starting of
one building.” This building will be
that of the school of education and
will be situated according, to present
plans, on the site of the present biol-
ogy laboratory and emergency hall.
The Chancellor continued: “We are
now trying to secure funds for a
library building and we also expect to
start the Heinz activities building
after a little. Then too, next year
withiadditions to the teaching staff

‘and new equipment which we expect

to purchase, we will be better able
to take care of_ the increased number
of students which have already been
promised and do more effective work.”
The Chancellor touched upon the
matter of the increased fees: “I want
to extend appreciation for the cooper-
ation of the students up to the meas-
ure of their ability. The fees for next
year will be very convenient. _I
think that we shall ﬁnd everybody will
be gainers.” _ _ _
“All in all this year just closing
has been a good year. All in all the
coming year with new students, out-
look for new buildings, and increased
equipment has ‘the promise of being
the best year in the history _of the
University. Let us-‘separate with the
purpose to make next year be the best
possible from every standpoint.”
The Chancellor told of the excellent

reputation the school had acquired in .

Ohio, Pennsylvania and West Virgin-
ia as evidenced by the praise he heard
in Clarksburg when he visited ther
last week. .

 

SECOND MELLON
INSTITUTE ‘ INSPECTION.

 

The second public inspection of the
new Mellon Institute will be held on
Tuesday. June 15, from three to ﬁve
P. M. The doors of the new building
will be thrown open to the public.

The new building will be inspected
by many of the students who did not
have the opportunity.to visit the new
building on Charter’s‘ Day on account
of conﬂicting arrangements.

The fellows of. the Institute will be
in attendance and will escort the visi-
tors through the building explaining
the points of interest. ’

CHANCELLOR TO HOLD
RECEPTION WEDNESDAY.

Chancellor S. B. McCormick will
receive undergraduates and alumni of
the University at his annual recep-
tion to be held at the Hotel Schenley,
Wednesday afternoon, June 16, from 3
to 5 p. in.

which will be dedicated to the mem-
cry of the class of 1915, on Thursday,
June 10th, at 3 P. M.
Mr. A. F. Thompson, Mines, is the
chairman of the committee in charge
of the dedication and has completed

arrangements for this annual affair. »

J. W. W. HALLOCK.

ENGINEERS in
HAVE NEW  
ADVISDR

J. W. W. Hallock, ’12, to Fill

New Position as Overseer of

Co-operation Work. _

 

“Another forward step in engineer-
ing education is marked by the recent
appointment of John Wilson Wishart
Hallock, Eng. ’-12, to the new position
of instructor and overseer of engineer-
ing students who are doing coopera-
tion work.

Mr. Hallock will have charge of all
the engineering students in coopera-
tive work. He will obtain positions
for the students in industrial plants
and will visit each man at his work,
making reports to the school on the
work being done by each student.
He will also advise as to the relation
of the cooperative work to the school
work. ,

All the sophomores and juniors of
the School of Engineering spend one
half of their time on this practical
side of their education.

Mr. Hallock will give special at-
tention to making himself acquainted
with the engineering freshman .so
that he will be able to intelligently
place them in outside work during
their sophomore year. Special private
conferences will likely be aranged for
the incoming freshmen in the fall.

“Owing to the increased enrollment
and consequently the increased num-
ber of students in cooperative work
it was found necessary to put in a

-man to give his whole time ‘to this

matter,” said Dean Bishop of the
School of Engineering.

' “Outside of this school the Univer-
sity of Cincinnati is the only other
school in the country that arranges
this cooperative work for students.”

.TELLS or HIS STUDENTS.

I Relates Experiences as Princi-
pal of Boarding School and as‘

Preacher.

 

i,Rev. Raymond L. Archer, ’11, alum-
nus of the College, now a »missionary
o fthe Board of Foreign Missions of

. the M. E. Church to Buitenzorg, Java,

was the speaker at the regular weekly
assembly on Friday morning. The
fact that Mr. Archer was a Pitt stud-
ent made the talk doubly. interesting.
Mr. Archer told of his feelings for his
mother country as he sailed out of
New York harbor and of his increased

land. _

In speaking of the size and popula-
tion of Java the speaker said “Java
which .is one of the islands of the
Netherland’s East.Indies is as -large
as the state of Pennsylvania. There
are no famines. Crops are grown the
whole year round. In one ﬁeld a man
may be seen just planting his crop

_ of rice or corn; close by another may

be harvesting and a third may have
ﬁelds just half-grown. The mountains
are ever green pyramids, because of
the depth of the soil and the abund-
ance of rainfall. In the rainyseason
which extend sfrom October to May,
rain falls on the average twenty-four
days a month. In "dry season the
average rain fall is fourteen days and
the rain fall of a year is ten to twelve
feet. It never rains in the morning;
Always in the afternoon or sometimes
in the evening.  

Mr. Archer then outlined his work
as a missionary. He is, principal or
a.dvisor of eight schools in Java and
its vicinity. A The main school of the
eight is a combined day school. where
the English grade and high school
work is given. In this school there
are about sixty Chinese and native
boys; recruited from Java, -Borneo,
and Sumatra. Six Malay schools, one
in Java and ﬁve others in the vicinity
are maintained for the poorer classes
of natives. His duties as minister
give him charge of six churches, one
in Java and ﬁve in the vicinity.

“The Chinese though they are Con-
fucianists are heartily supporting our
work in Java. The rich Chinese mer-
chants of Java are giving $10,000 to-
ward a new school building.” The
speaker cited a number of instances
wherein the" young Chinese sacriﬁced
things for Christianity. -

Mr. Archer was a hustler when he
was a student at the University and
is now a member of the Alumni asso-
ciation. A letter from him to the
General Secretary appeared on the
Alumni page of the. WEEKLY of
April 29. Mr. Archer arrived in this
country on May 14 and_has nine months
tospend with his fellow countrymen.

John J. O’Connor, ’10, exhibited the
portrait of Dr. Dyess which will be
presented to the University and will
be placed in the new student building.
He made an appeal to those students
who “owed a spiritual ‘and intellectual
debt to Dr. Dyess-.” to send some con-
tribution for the portrait , to Dean
Fetterman. I

PLAY DAY FESTIVAL
* VS. CO-ED POLITICS.

 

With the ﬁrst annual play day but
six days away and the probable suc-
cess of the whole endeavor _depending
upon the hearty and earnest co-opera-
tion of all those who are_to take part
in the exercises, dissension is evident-
ly shaking the ranks of the W. A. A.,
and the girls who are to attend the
queen upon her crowning venture
have NOT yet been selected. As near-
ly as can be ascertained by a PITT
,WEEKLY reporter from amid . the
ever,-changing versions of. the affair,
the whole trouble is caused by those
“awful politics” and the cause of this
state of affairs is not only the ab-
sence of. one “boss” who can say “do
this or that,” but -rather the presence
of a multiplicity of bosses all of
whom have nice big whips and differ-
ent opinions. " ‘ V

TREE PLANTING DAY
AT SCHENLEY PARK.

The students of Pitt and Tech-have
been invitedto co-operate in the cere-
mony of planting a number of apple
‘trees upon an acre of ground in
Schenley Park on Tuesday morning,
June 15.. This ground‘ has been set
aside by G. -W.‘i Burke, director of
public grounds, and thetrees will be
planted by the New_ Era club of ‘Pitts-
burgh. Each of the trees will be
named for men prominent in the city,
including Chancellor McCormick,-Di-
rector Hammerschlag — of Tech, and
each of .the former presidents of the
club. The programeis in charge of

COLLEGE FRESHMAN
GIRLS HOLD PICNIC.

At a picnic held last Wednesday
afternoon at the old Snyder log cabin
in Schenley Park, twenty-ﬁve College
freshman girls and their friends made
merry in spite of threatening show-
ers. The chaperons were Mrs. T. J.
Heath and Mr. and Mrs. J.  Jones.’

The party left State hall at three-
thirty and walked‘ to the park. The
afternoon was occupied with tennis
and ball games. The girls claim that
the stallar performer in the ball
games was Mrs. Heath.

Supper was served at six o’clock.
The fare was regular picnic “cats”
and was served in picnic fashion. The
party left the park at eight o’clock.

, This is the last affair of a most
succesful series of social functions
that have been aranged by the Fresh-
men girls this year. Plans’ are al-
ready being considered for the contin-
uance of this‘ social activity next year.

The committee in charge of this pic-
nic was Margaret Davis and Agnes
Dickson.

HAS HOST or FRIENDS.

On the crest of a wave of enthusi-
asm never before equalled in affairs
of the. kind at the University a check
for $1,000.00 was presented to‘ Dr.
Francis .Cliﬂ"ord Phillips during the
testimonial dinner tendered to him and
Mrs. Phillips last Thursday evening
at the German club in Craft ave., by
his former students and friends.

The occasion was the retirenieiit of
Dr. Philips from active service at the

head of the department of chemistry,

after forty years of continuous ser-
vice in the Western University of

"Pennsylvania and the University of

Pittsburgh: ’Dr. Phillips’ future rela-
tion to the University will be that of
“emeritus professor of chemistry,”
and he will, under the terms of the
Carnegie Foundation, have a pension
equal to half of his previous salary,
which will enable him to pursue his
scientiﬁc ‘ research and his literary
work,. in peace and contentment for
the rest of his life, a period which
bids fair to be the most productive
of all his long and fruitful career.

The crowd, consisting of about one
hundred alumni and faculty members
with their friends, all of whom had
been associated with Dr. Phillips _dur-
ing his stay here, in a more or ‘less
intimate way, gathered about six-
thirty. A ﬂashlight picture of the
group was taken.

cuss DAY TO HATE  
USUAL FEATURES

The customary-program of humor-
ous and semi-serious speeches by the
graduates, intermingled with musical
selections of both voice and piano,
will feature the annual class day exer-
cises in Memorial hall, at ten-thirty,
Friday morning, June 11.

After a vocal solo by Lillian Wood,
the class prophet in the person of
Leroy D. Boaz will appear and fore-
tell the leading events of the future,
for the class of 1915, in a selection
entitled “Life Among the Doins.”
“Our Athletes,” a eulogy, resume,
and athletic prophecy combined, will
be the theme of J. P. Herron, in which
he will present the past performances
of "the year and the’ promises for the
future._ It‘. will also contain short
eulogistichistories of the men in the
class of 1915 who have won places of
distinction through their athletic
prowess. '

Robert A. Lewis, as class knocker,
will follow a piano solo by J. Kwal-
wasser. , In accordance with the prin-
ciples of the greatly-agitated cam-
paign for “Safety -First,” “Bob” is
keeping his speech under cover, but
it is rumored that he is to seize this
last opportunity of presenting to his
classmates pen portraits of them-
selves as others see them. The class
reading by J. P. Heiner will be inthe
nature of a history of the accomplish-
ments and near failures of the class
during its four years sojourn at Pitt.
In the class will, Florence Teagarden
is planning to far .out_shine the last

PITT STUDENTS ARE —
AWARDED HONORS

Benjamin M. Selekman, a senior in
the School of Economics, and Miss
Estelle DeYoiung, who is taking‘grad-
uate work at the University, have won
two out of the four annual collegiate
felowships offered by the New York
School of Philanthropy, in a national
competitive examination. conducted by
that institution. The ;fellowship is
worth $600.

_ Throughout the country there were
in alll64 candidates for the fellow-
ships, as the school is one of note,
and the“training received of‘ inestim-
able value to the graduate student.
The successful competition of these
two _Pitt students confers quite a dis-
tinction upon the institution as well
as tuponthe victors, as this is the ﬁrst
time such an honor has been gained
by a local student. *

Selekman will be ‘a graduate in the
class of _1915, although he entered in
.1912, being one of the few exceptions
to complete the required four year
course in three years. At all times he
has been an active‘ member. of his
class. He was captain of two of this
year’s debating teams, one of which
obtained the only victory of the
season. He was a member of the
Student Senate during the past year,
and was also a member of the Con-
stitutional committee. He received
his preparatory training in Latrobe
high school, where he graduated with
ﬁrst honors.

‘EDUCATION A PRIVIELEGE.

Advantage of Higher Educati
Pointed Out by Success 111
business Man.

H. J. Heinz, one of Pittsburgh's
most noted business men and one‘ who
has done much for the welfare of the
University of Pittsburgh was the
speaker at the exercises held in Me-
morial hall, Monday morning. Mr.
Heinz spoke on the value of a col-
lege education to a student of the
twentieth century, ‘and compared it
to theipublic school education that he
was obliged to accept as almost the
limit of knowledge. 3 ,

Mr. Heinz said in part:

I168‘? that Y0l_1 students of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh have at the
present time. I don’t mean to lecture
to you, but I mean to have a heart
to heart talk with you, as I am about
to speak from what I -have observed
through all ‘my years‘ of experience.
Most young men and women don’t ap-
preciate the worth of higher educa-
tion. It might be because most of us
can afford it. It’s the poor man’s son
that knows its value, for if given the

wear the rich man’s jacket nine times
out of ten.

_“I realize that most of us would
like to be Carnegie. The trouble is
that most of you want to start of!
where Carnegie is now. You realize
not that he began working with a red
bandana handkerchief around his
neck. When but a newsboy he began
to distribute and contribute by mak-
ing people happy. This it is that
makes the man.

“There are three essentials that a
student must do in order to make a
success of his college career. They
are (1) learning something, (2) know.
ing something, (3) and doing some-
thing. Together with these the stud-
ent must add honor, capacity and en-
ergy._ .

“It was only recently that a noted
business man asked me if I believed
in a college education! Yes, most as-
suredly, was my reply. Twentieth

the present time. In my time men
were content with a common school
education. I want to say to you stud-
ents in closing that you will get out
of life exactly what you put into iit.
You will derive from this school‘ ex-
actly what you put into it. Its just
like every other thing in life, you get
out of it the proportion of investment
you put into it. It is your duty to
make out of it the best that you
can. '

JOHN WHITE ALEXANDER.

The art lovers ' of ‘Pittsburgh and
New York and Paris are mourning the
passing of? John-.White Alexander,
perhaps the best-known Pittsburgher
who has made‘ his mark on canvas,
andﬁfor, many years‘ president of the
National Academy of Design. -Mr.
Alexander.’s death occurred in the
prime of his life, at the age ofAforty-
nine years, when 'much earnest and
sterling gvork} might‘ yet. have been
expected from him,‘ and its untimely
nature is one of the chief circustances
whichiadds to its loss. a

The life of the painter was one long
inspiration to every struggling genius.
Born on the old Northside, but ‘soon
orphaned, he barely subsisted for
years in a continuous search for his

"‘gleam," the practice of the art which

he innately loved." He was essentially
a self-taught man,“being never direct-
ly under the ‘ tutelage ‘or dominating
inﬂuence of one man for any lengthy
period. He .was, however, an eclectic,
choosing from many styles and--in-
dividuals the features which‘ harmon-
ized best with his own temperament.
Always he was Whistlerian in,rnan--
ner, carrying on‘ the chief points of
Whistler’s tradition, in the sweeping
lines borrowed from Velasquez, the
decorative backgrounds of Japanese
and the subdued neutral
greys relieved by splotches of *,occas-

ionally brilliant" color which made the

great Americanfs canvasses so fa‘scin-

outstanding characteristic of his style.
He was -never a strong draughtsman
or a great _'col'orist:, but he atoned for
his technical ‘deﬁciencies by a super-
abundance of “atmosphere,”_ - and
charm. ' ' * '

Pittsburgh, where he ‘ ‘gained "his
start, and where perhaps his greatest
mural work has its place of honor,
may well take thought of this great
man... The spirit. of the -city, knightly
in -the midst of the grime of commer-
cialization,. which furnishes the motif
for the hall which bears his name in

the great grey pile at the entrance to

Schenley park, will forever ‘be his
best and "most "enduring monument,
pointing Pittsburghers above the
gloom, and blazoning the upward-,
striving path toward the eternal goal
of truth. i

much of fraternity politics, which are
fortunately not half as bad as they
are painted. ~_But that the suggestion
of such, an idea as sorority politics

upon the sisterly love of our institu-

To: the kunderclassmen andlhto that
great mass of A non-college .men and
women, who have —never, been ’initiated

fitting that, out of a composite View

, of all thelrush and festivities of the

closing,weeks of a year, the outstand-
ing characteristics should be those of
sadness. , , _v
Seemingly this time should becne
of joy and gladness, the‘ end of a long
four years’ struggle, on many, days
of which ﬁunks and other petty an-
noyances had'made one wishthat he
were far from here and ‘somewhere

‘world. To the casual onlooker, it is
the crowning day which marks the
attainment of the goal, the last rush
which carries victory with it after
the long daily grind; it indicates the
culmination of all those, efforts which
yield the marks of culture and other
things to distinguished the colleg man
from amid therank and ﬁle of the
world; but instead———underlying these‘
feelings or temporary prid’e——all is
sadness. ' .

Amid the pages of our learned con.-
temporary of the crouching ‘nature,
which ever and anon appears with a
line of real humor gained with the
aid of. scissors and paste can, ‘one
meets, with the customary line of in-
lvective that characterizes that chief
of reformers, the vociferous demand
that the .neo-graduates “lay aside the
unbecoming accouterments of the
twentieth century commencement and
appear in-the garments by which one
may more readily be enabled to out-
shine his fellows; But is not this
same_ old “cap and gown” of beﬁtting
signiﬁcance on such an occasion? Not
that they add any touch to the “learn-
edivity” of the wearer, for_ even a
whole wardrobe could not conceal
some of the freaks to whom diplom-
as have been awarded in the ‘past, but
7-that these same “weeds” have a cer-
tain. warm and clinging adherence-.-—
on a hot day .especially——-to thatlsame
felling of sadness which is ever’ hang-
ing around at Commencement time
and whichncan be only temporarily
dispersed by two shut-out victories
over State.

Perhaps—-and most probably-‘-the
real reason is that it is the end; not
only the end of days of hard work,
worries, failures, dissappointments,
lessons, last minute crammings, kicks
and examinations, but it is'~a1so the
ﬁnish of all those “Other" little pleas-
ures which the busiest man usually
ﬁnds time to snatch up, as he rvushes
from one task to another. After four
years of that close companionship
which seems so impossible of attain-
ment to the new freshman, but into
which the man worth-while naturally
drifts and from which a few unfort-

uation means the ﬁnal step over the
border and into the new and untried
paths of life. Gradually the old con-
fidence which enabled him to navigate
successfully the dangerous oceans of
coeducation ' will reassert» itself, but
just... now it is the unknown, and a
feeling of uncertainty ensues. He now
begins to realize with _'poignant sor-
rows that the world ‘of business. has
no place amid success for those strolls
upon the campus and those little ‘con-
versations in the hallways;_ that it
affords no opportunity for harmless
ventures into ‘politics and reforms, or
digressions into the various activities.
Then and there alone does the reali-
zation of all these little insigniﬁcant
grains of sands have indeed made a
mound which will long be a‘ landmark
along his course but to which he can
scarcely hope to return. *

ii .Before a record breaking crowd of

 A commencement day visitors the Blue

and Gold baseball nine again wielded
the whitewash brush to - the Penn
State nine sending all their hopes and
claims for the championship of the
state glimmering. Over three thous-
and Blue and White supporters turned
out to cheer on their favorites, having
no doubt but that the game would

. prove an easy victory for their team.

But emulating the ﬁne work of Lang-
don on Saturday, Al Hart, the fresh-
man-pitcher, let the hard-hitting
Center county boys down with but six
hits and no runs. 

L The game was an extra one sched-
uled to decide the winner of therseries,
both Pitt and State having won one
game. State with 19 victories out of
21 was almost certain of winning. She
had downed such teams as Princeton,
Navy, Swarthmore, Lehigh, Dart-
"mouth, South Carolina A. & M., and
many others. Previous to this two
games they had only s'uﬂ"ered one real
defeatrand that was by the Army,
who are setting the pace in the east.

. ' .Pitt’s wonderful showing clearly gives

them the right to the championship
of the state and a good claim upon a
high rating amongst the leading col-
leges of the country.

Playing erroless ball and hitting in
the pinches,
across four tallies and at the same

time held the opposition runless-.1

Pittsburgh’s runs came in the second
and eight frames. In the second
Hastings doubled to left, Peck, dropped
a Texas leaguer over second scoring
Hastings. Gray fanned, Hart singled,
scoring Peck, Englehardt ﬂied to
Crawford and Morrow fanned. Nothing
else resulted until the eight when Pitt
shoved two more runs across the pan.
Engelhardt opened the session by
singling to left, Morrow doubled to
left and both runners scored on Vogt’s
wild through to catch Morrow going
to third. ‘ ,
' Several times State appeared
dangerous, but always Hart tightened
“up, or was held up by the sensational
playing of his backers. The game put
-up by the Pitt team in these two
games was certainly wonderful. Only
one misplay was credited against
them in the two encounters. Their
playing clearly ‘gives them a just
claim for the championship of the

state.

While the members of the Varsity
team were earning a niche in the Pitt
Hall.;of Fame by defeating the Penn
Statecrew the Freshmen were wind-
ing‘ up their season with a ‘clear-cut
«victory over the Ben Avon nine, by
the score of 4-2. ' '

Kennedy did the premier work for
the Pitt delegation in the capacity of
pitcher. The opposition succeeded in
getting to him for but four hits, while
fourteen of the men who faced him re-
tired by the strike-out route. In the
meantime his team mates had been
collecting the eight hits which netted
thefour runs for Pitt.

Pitt started the entertainment early
by pushing a man across the plate in
the initial inning. The second frame
was a blank, but in the third deal
Carlson’s reliables hung up two more
counters. Another run in the eighth
completed the scoring from the camp

The Ben Avon aggre-

hits they succeeded in putting across
a brace of runs. Both the! Pitt runs

and those of the oposition were scored

cleanly, but the high school men were
*unable to secure the wallops oft‘ Ken-
nedy necessary to score the three runs

v that they needed to win the contest.

Maybe State is sorry it {persuaded
the Pitt bunch to stay ove and play
that third game.

The announcement that “Chalky”
Williamson is in good shape once more
makes the same sort of appeal to us
that the fall of Berlin—-not yet an-
nounced, by the way—would make to
Kitchener. .

No wonder Pitt took those two
games from State. Didn’t the Var-
sity leave Sam Eckles in Pittsburgh?

.__o:
With the notice of the departure of

sity tennis comes a degree’ of compen-
sation in the further announcement
that “Herb” Lytle, last year’s court
manager and player, will probably be
among. us next season, competing
from the Law school. Another tennis
eligible will be Burgwinf held out
this year because of playing at Trin-
ity in 1914. The addition of these two
men will do much to make up for the
loss of McEllroy and Gaut, ﬁrst-string
men this spring. A

Captain “Pink” Healy did a little
tycobbing on his own hook in the last
West Virginia game. After his double
had scored Engelhardt in the ﬁrst
inning, the leader with the sunburned
hair came all the way home on De-
Hart’s -sacriﬁcial bunt. “Jimmy” laid
the ballin front of the plate, and was
thrown out by Fidler, the Mountain-
Ieers’ catcher. Healy kept up his mad
pace around third and dove for home

counting the second -run of the inning.
The worst of it is that rain in the

made Healy’s performance go for
‘naught. '

Three thousand fans pulling for
State last Saturday made more difli-

porters, but the big Swede pulled
through without lowering his_colors.
In the eighth inning the Blue and
White’s cheering section began to sing
but their efforts at harmony were
hardly enough to put Langdon down
for the count.

EIANAGERIAL Posmous

 

Announcement of the appointment
of the managers of the different Var-
sity and Freshman athletic teams for
the next year was made this week by
Director of Athletics Miller and Grad-
uate Manager Davis. The positions
for managers of the several teams are
secured by competition, under rules
drawn up by the Athletic council.
Under this system the candidates for
the positions are compelled to work
as apprentices for at least one year.
The work done during this year along

manager for the next year is appoint-
ed. This system has proved very suc-
cessful. '

As the manager of the gridiron
squad we ﬁnd that the man who so
ably held down that position last year
has been reappointed for next season,
A. K. ‘ Collingwood, Econ. ’16, more

past twenty-ﬁve years or so the Uni-

less prominently by a football team.
Early in the 90’s WUP walloped a
large variety of foemen, the A. 1904
bunch was good enough to create a
fairsized sensation in parts adjacent

to Pittsburgh, and the 1910 crew led"

by “Tex” Richards exceeded their op-_
ponents’ «total of zeroby nearly three
hundred points. _ q '
Somehow or other, though, all these
things failed to “get across” with the
elect. Every athletic expert, under-

neath the ﬂag knew. all about the »“big’f_

teams from the East and the West,
but his information about the occu-

pants of the Western Pennsylvania
wilderness was apt ‘to be somewhat

hazy. All of themhad seen the Pitt

games, it must be that she had a foot-
ball team. Of course, after Columbus

IIEBIIIIIIS SMASHED
IN PITT-STATE MEET

 

Handicapped by the absence of
sprinters, the Blue and Gold track men
went down to defeat before the State
performers in the presence of the
large Commencement crowd at State

College on Monday. The Pitt entrges c

could not score in the dashes, and in
those events the Center countians
scored points which went far toward
giving them the large end of an
82-44 score. '

Preeminent among the members of

the Varsity squad was “Johnny” Shee— ‘

han. In the broad jump each of Shee-
han’s efforts was over 23 feet, his best-
try being 23 feet 51/2 inches, beating
the Pitt record by over a foot and

ern Pennsylvania. In the high leap,
“Johnny” tied with two State men at
5 feet 8 inches, and narrowly missed
establishing anotherrecord two inches
higher. 9 ‘ ‘

Grumbling broke another Varsity
record in the half-mile run when he
outsprinted Shea and Stone of State
in the stretch. Thomas won the mile
by walking away from his rivals in
the last furlough, coming close to. the
old record held by “Fresh” .Knotts.
Livermore in the two-mile lowered_his
own mark established in the W. & J.
meet, but the record will not stand be-
cause “Liver” was beaten out by
Hunter, of State. The- Pitt man
gained largely in the ﬁnal stages of
the race, but couldn’t quite make it
at the ﬁnish. _ i .

_Burwell -started in the century
dash, despite his injured leg, but
could not place,’ and did not enter the
220-yard sprint. In both these events
Pitt failed to score a point. Inlthe
quarter-‘mile Mays took third, just a
step behind Ludwig, in a race which
broke State’s record. ,.

For the ﬁrst time this season Suth-
erland failed to land ﬁrst in the discus,
being bested by Jester, of the oposi-
tion- “Jock” beat Lamb in this event.
Lamb took ﬁrsts in‘ the hammer_and
the shot, Pitt gettingsecond and third
in each case. ’ ' ' ,
‘3Lou” McMasters ,came_. . through
with hisusual. lviunchi/fofl points, win-
ning the pole vault over Page,nhis last
year’s conqueror, and I taking thirds
in the low hurdles and the broad jump.

The ; result of the meet brings a
great deal of satisfaction to Pitt men,
indicating as it does considerable im-
provement since the Syracuse meet.
Two or three». men‘ who competed,
against, the New Yorkers were not in
the ‘State contest, and this really in-
cludes Burwell, who won both the.100
and the 220 at Syracuse. With
practically every one of this year’s
Varsity back next year, the prospects
are bright for a. winning record.

upon the Blue and White boys downed

them in the ﬁrst of a two-game series

to the tune of 1 to 0. 9

Pitching airtight ball at times and
backed at other times by ‘perfect sup-
port, “Eddie” Langdon wielded the
whitewash brush to perfection and
held the hard hitting up-state aggre-
gation to six hits. The big port-sid-
er showed his best form ‘of the season
and kept the opposing batters swing-
ing at his offerings with no result.
Nine of the State men went out via
the strike-out route.

, Hesselbacher, the lucky twirler who
downed the Pitt team on the previous
meeting of these teams this year, was
on the ﬁring line again, and display-
ed an article of . pitching that would
win nine out of tengames. Both
pitchers allowed but six hits, two of
these being two baggers by Langdon
and Peck of Pitt. Langdon was wild-
er than his opponent, walking two
and hitting three others. Both teams ‘
succeeded in getting a man on base

in almost every inning, but old timely

hit was lacking and only one tally

resulted.

The playing of the Pitt team was
the best they have yet displayed, and
showed what they were really capable
‘of. Only one error was charged
against them and that worked no
harm. The ﬁelding sensation of the
day was pulled in the sixth inning by
Morrow. With two men down and
second and third bases populated»,
Blythe of State met one of Langdon’s
offerings square on the head and sent‘
it toward the woods. Morrow started
with the crack of the bat and just, as
he turned to catch it, fell. From this’
position he made a stab at the ball
and. held on to it. It was-onepof the
most sensational plays ever witnessed.
on, the State ﬁeld and the three thous-
and odd fans cheered the Pitt boy to
the echo. . ~ ‘

do nothing and only one tally resulted. j

Besides the sixth inning, the State

Coming events cast their shadows
before iii’ the distribution to football
candidates this week of questionaries,
asking for information as to name,
summer address, previous football ex-
perience and other points. One of
included is
“When can you report for practice?”

Graduate Manager Davis conferred I

with Coach Warner a few days ago
as to the plans for the fall. An-
nouncement will be made soon of the
time for beginning practice, and the
place for reporting, The camp at
Windber will be maintained again

-during the coming‘ year.

ALUMNI TEAM TO
‘ BE STRONG BUNCH.

Manager “Bobby” Grove announces
the fact'that he has an alumni team
selected for the game on Commence-
ment afternoon—an aggregation of
such remarkable playing qualities
that he will be able to hang the cur-
tain on the Varsity without the least
particle of trouble. When confront-
ed by the fact that there was a pos-
sibility pf 'his men being required to
‘face the swift shoots from Langdon’s
incomparable arm or the indomitable
prowess ,of Hart, the former manager
of Pitt’s baseball nine stuck to his
convictions with all the sturdy vigor
which has made him famous.

Manager “Bobby” was very reluc-
tant to divulge the names of his trusty
nine lest the Pitt men attempt to
unhook some Federal dope, but after
much exercise olf the persuasive
faculty the names were supplied. Ac-
cording to the dope of the Alumni
Manager, his squad will be as fol-

lows: Thounhurst utility; Rectenwald, ,

ﬁrst base; Qvuailey, outﬁeld; Gaw,
2nd; Bobby Russell, ‘S; Hube Wag-
ner, outﬁeld; Joe Harenski, pitcher;
Johnny Baker and Walter Allen,
catchers.

Grove says he _still lacks a third-
sacker, but should the time of the con-
test arrive without a man for that po-
sition he will play under the handi-
cap, so great is his conﬁdence in the

-squad of his choosing.

In any event, the people who pre-
sent themselves at Trees ﬁeld for this
game will be assured a brand of en-
tertainment that will pay them for
the effort entailed in reaching the
scene of the conﬁict. "

,With the clean-cut win over the

wound up their season.’ After this

According to the dope dished out by

squad, the following men will be en’-
titled to the mark of honor given to
Freshmen: Carlson, capt.), Friedland-

, er, Miller, Kennedy, DeWalt, McMur-

ray, McCormick, Meadows, O’Donnell

REILLY CHOSEN
TO HEAD WRESTLERS.

By a ballot vote the members of
the wrestling squad decided upon
William Reilley,' Mines ’17, as captain
of the next year’s mat team. By
reason of the fact that therewere no
letter men this year the captain was

‘chosen by last year’s letter men wh_o

were still in school and those who
made the State trip this year.

With R. L. Huff as manager, Reilley'

in the capacity of captain, and the
able Reinecke as coach, the 1916 team

.shOuld be the best Pitt has ever pro-

duced. Sutherland gives great prom-
ise of being a heavyweight-of consid-
erable genius. Kendrick and possibly
some others are showing well in the
175-pound class. Forbes, Reilley,
Huff, Forster, Boyer and Blaustein
will be in the game for all there is in
it. - .

MANY REPLIES IN
PRIZE CONTEST.

(Continued from page 4.)

contest on the most worthy subject,
“Why is a, Cheer Leader.” It occur-
red to me when that headline ﬂashed
out of THE WEEKLY that the query
was to be found in the same category
with “Why is a Friday Assembly.”
Both are designed to instill some
extra pep into the student body and
both seem to fail singly in their pur-
pose.

I am told that in the dayslgone by
the cheer leader was a ravenously car-
nivorous creature who fed himself
upon the body, soul, and spirit of the
defeated enemies of our august Uni-
versity. Now he has descended from
that great state of primal strength.
He now replenishes his watery blood
with dainty drafts of thin air and the
tenderest of grasses and uses what
bit of energy is therefrom derived to
knock the poorly supported team that

lost. .

Dear Sporting Ed:—-

Here is my solution of your prob-
lem, “Why is a Cheerleader.” I shall
hope to learn, thru‘the columns of
your valuabled paper, that the'prize
is to be mine. -
Why is a Cheerleader?
Heaven can tell. . 
What? They have failedfyou?
Try down at Tech.

Not to lead cheers, son-—-
Nothing so crude. .
Yelling makes noise, girls-—
Shouting is rude. 3

Sensitive natures

Have A cheerleaders-—quite.

They can’t stand in front, there,
In everyone’s sight!)

Absence of pep is what
Cheerleaders need.

They should be qualiﬁed
Two-steps to lead.

Cheerleader’s voices
Should never be rough.
Yelling might make them
Manlike, and tough.

Cheerleaders, delicate,
Work should avoid; _
And by thoughts of labor
Be never annoyed.

A ch_eerleader’s mission ,
In’life,’is_ to look,_ ‘
Just like a hero *

We have the_..f_olloWing. letter ‘from
Norman M. Griei',"1I, -who is located
in St. Louis and who has been stirring
up the handfull of. Pitt grads in that
city: -

. “ ‘Banquet’ of Pitt men in St. Louis
came off 0 K with S. F. Andrews, '78,

and myself in attendance. Pittof the
past was the subject of many inter-
esting reminiscences by Mr. Andrews,
associated with the names of Messrs.
Benjamin Thaw and others. The other
alumni present, although feeling rath-
er young with a ’78’er‘ such as Mr.
Andrews, compared notes, and at the
end of an enjoyable evening, it was
decided to get the Pitt men of St.
Louis and vicinity together again in
the fall-.” ‘

‘A _paper prepared jointly by-Pro-
fessor R. H, Johnson and L. G. Hunt-
ly wil be presented before the Engi-
neers Society of Western Pennsylvan-
ia in the Oliver building, June; 8., on
“The Inﬂuence of the Cushing Pool on
the Oil Industry.” ‘ ,

The Cushing Pool has brought out
many problems in the oil industry,
among which are the following:

“The Cushing pool contained so
very much oil that there was an over-
production; the price was lowered and
the market was upset. C It will be dif-
ﬁcult to. obtain as high as $2.00 per
barrel for Oklahoma _'oil A for several
years on accoiint of this over produc-
tion of oil and Pennsylvania oil will
not bring more than $3.00 per barrel
for many years.‘ , . ,

“There is much oil in the :Mexican
ﬁelds but it cannot be developed on
account of the political difliculties. .
_ "‘The increasing, use of steel _tanks
in ‘the case of an over production tends
to steady the price. ,

“One ‘trouble is the uneconomical

r tendency to cut’ up the tracts into very

small areas. The Oliver plan is the
remedy -for this. . The Oliver. plan

. calls for the leasing in public lands in

large quantities to a company to
which those interested could subscribe
stock. This would remedy the drain-
ing‘ of the ‘pools -all atone time and
w‘ould_make‘ a steady market. ’

Lloyd B. Smith, ‘who tookthe oil
courses as a graduate student. two

logical engineer. to ‘accept a position

loft the seventies, when the scientiﬁc
ldepartments of the University were in
a state of embryo, and the great
lLangley was just/beginning to come
iinto prominence. I
Dr. Phillips. was then given an op-
portunity to speak, -as the program
had ._.it_, “representing himself.” He
expressed his overwhelming sense ,of
joy and gratitude at the demonstra-
tion which far surpassed. the utmost
dreams of himself and ’Mrs. Phillips.
He ‘also spoke interestingly of his
early years in W. U.: P. andin Ger-
many. Professor» Alexander Silver-
man, ’02, the present director, of the
department of chemistry and the chair-
man of. the testimonial dinner com-
mittee, which had charge"
arrangements, speaking in behalf of
alumni and former students of Dr.
lPhillips, presented the one thousand
dollar check to the guest of honor,
together with aframedc photograph‘
thereof, for keeping, a cut of which

collected from a small group of in-
terested alumni, and will probably be
used by the professor and his wife
for a vacation trip ‘to the Panama-
Paciﬁc exposition. * Professor i»Silver-
man’ read a number of letters from
the friends who had contributed to
the fund, among them being commun-
ications from “Uncle Dan” Carhart,
Dr. R. F. Baconand Clifford Phillips,
son of the doctor-, who‘were detained
elsewhere. All spoke most feelingly
‘of their relations to Dr.,Phillips, and
their hearty approval of the project.
Other speakers called upon by the
toastmaster from among the banquet-
ers, were Robert B. Carnahan, ’91, of
Middletown, 0.,‘ an old student, and
Professor Joseph H. James, head’ of
the department of chemical engineer-
ing at the Carnegie Institute of Tech-
nology. The oldest. alumnus present
was Silas‘ Gault, "76, of Erie, Pa.
Many of the most prominent chemists
and scientists of the (Pittsburgh dis-
trict were at the dinner, including all
the members of the faculty of the de-
partment of chemistry. A pleasing
feature of the occasion was the show-.
ing of some "pictures on the screen
which gave a brief visual history of
Dr. Phillips from childhood through
his student days at Pennsylvania and
Wiesbaden, and later. Mrs. Phillips
responded "gracefully to the insistent
calls for her, with ‘a toast to “The Old
Boys.” _The music for the occasion
was furnished by Gus Schnabe1’s or-
chestra.
