Panthers Hope  

To Pull Surprise
On Bell's Crew

By DON GIFFIN
Sports Editor

There won’t be a brass band at Pennsylvania Station this
evening to herald the arrival of the Southern Metl1odistifoot-
ball team. The Mustangs don’t need one, anyway, for they
have already been heralded by press “rave” notices on a na-
tion-wide scale. '

Matty Bell’s 1947 Southwestern Conference champions
are coming to Pittsburgh tovhelp Pitt inaugurate its grid season
tomorrow afternoon at Pitt Stadium.

The impending arrival of SMU doesn't have the Pan-
thers dusting ‘off the “welcome,” mat and practicing a.
bow-and-scrape act, though; A

In fact, they are far from ready to lay down and play
dead. As Head Coach VVa.lter (Mike) Milligan puts it, “The
boys have worked hard preparing for this game. We’re look-
ing forward to sit, the players and the coaches.” -A

Milligan, beginning his second year at the Pitt hehn., calls
this.-year’s team “a hustling ball club.” This indicates. that
"the ’48 edition Won’t be even a reasonable facsimile of the ag-
gregation they closed the disastrous campaign last year with
a depressing loss to \Vest‘Virginia. ‘

Still, the Pitt coaches can’-t ignore the strength of
the Mustangs. Backﬁeld Coach Dick Cassiano hadthe du-
bious pleasure of scouting three SMU games last year and
rates the Texans “a great team with one of the ﬁnest col-
lections of backs on one team in a long time.”

Cassiano has more to say of the backﬁeld than the line,
classifying it, “high—speed.” Although lie; along with most
everybody else, marvels at the ability of Doak “Talker, the
cou11try’s most-highly publicized collegiate football player

this year, the former Pitt All-American praises many of the,
other SMU -backs, Gil Johnson, Paul Page, Frank. Payne, Kyle‘

Rote, and Dick McKissa.ck, for example.

‘,‘They play a, wide-open style of football,” he says.
“They’re willing_to gamble anywhere, anytime. And they’re
always dangerous. They often come from behind, as they did
in the three games I saw last year (Arkansas, Baylor, and
TCU).” ~ '

Pitt’s chances in the game shouldbe measured by their
success in corralling the Pony 1':‘¢3(3l10l‘S€S and usually-effective
aerial attack a11d in their offciisive onslaught on the SMU
forward wall which is an unknown quantityat present. Four
starting linemen are gone. .

4 If Saturday is a dry day, onlookers can expect to see
the Mustangs heaving more than 20 passes and_ a 50%
completion -ﬁgure, last year’s averages. _

In contrast, the Panthers have their team’ of last year with few

exceptions plus a Valuable man who missed the entire ._.?4,7_,,__can1- ,
paign because of a knee injury, Fullback Bill Abraham, the Jeanne‘L‘i..'i

sparkplug. - - ' ' - . .
I-Ialfbacks Lou‘ Cecconi and Bill Bruno, and Quarterback Walt
Cummins round out the backﬁeld. Although this trio saw plenty of
action last fall, Bruno was hampered by injuries." Gﬁmmins and
Guard Bernie Barkouskie spearheaded the often—strong Panther de-~
fense of a year ago. . . _ A
Captain Bill McPeak and Leo Skladany are paired at the ﬂanks
again for the third ‘straight year. _ P ' .
The crowd for the fray may not exceed 25,000. This despite

theipossibility that SMU might wind up the top teamin tlre country , 

this year. — ‘ _
The visitors are expected to arrival here by train at" 9' p. m."

tonight at the Roosevelt Hotel. A small group of, followers .~ is also:

° Abbe’s Mr. Quill A

?Joins Baffle
For Tolerance

By DICK KOVAR
Hailed as “the ﬁrst fact novel
on anti-semitism” yet published,
George Abbe’s novel, “Mr. Quill’s
Crusade,” will be released by the
llsland Press early in October._
The author, noted as a poet,
lnovelist, editor, and lecturer,
taught creative . writing at Pitt
‘last year while preparing his nov-
el for publication.‘ ‘
“Mr. Quill” is one of the artists
lcommissioned by the government
to paint scenes picturing Ameri-
can servicemen during the war,
‘after which he returns "to the
istates to seekia quiet home where
ihe can ﬁnish his paintings.
A He and his wife, Caren, with
their young son J uddie, ﬁnd a spot
in a small town where Quill will
not be recognized as the painter
of Service scenes in Greenland.
When Quill discovers that his
neighbors are Jewish, he immedi-
ately begins brooding on the sub-
ject‘ of intolerance, and apparent-
ly does- nothing else throughout
the rest of the story.

Jews Terrorized

Soon after the Quills’ arrival,
their neighbors, the Lerners, are
terrorized by a gang of young
hoodlums whom Quill believes to
be backed by a Mr. Greggs, own-
er of both the Quill "and the Ler-
ner homes, and a power in the
community. ‘* '

"Another target for violence is
Dr. Weiss, a world—famed psy-
chiatrist, whom Quill also be-
friends. As far as can be under-
stood from the book, the Lerners
and Dr. Weiss are the only Jew-
ish people in the community.

Further outrages are committed
by the townsfolk, while Quill does
his ‘best to carry on a one—man
campaign’ against such intoler-
ance. He enlists the aid of a
young school teacher, who be-
cause of her ‘liberal’ ideas is in
danger of being ﬁred. It is through
this teacher that the author gets
his best ideas across.

Things‘ go from bad to worse,
ending up with a climactic act of
terror in which Lerner and Weiss
are taken for a‘ ride by no less a
personage than Mr. Greggs. Ler-
ner escapes with _a broken arm,
while Dr. Weiss is thrown over ,a
cliff and remains between life, and
death for the remainder of the
book.

Sfo:-y's Climaxiweak

The actual climax‘ evidently
comes when Quill openly opposes
Greggs, defying him to prevent
an anti-intolerance rally at which
Quill is to speak. All ends well,
for the moment at least, when

guarding the assembly hall, se-
cures the aid of the American Le-
gion, and reveals himself as one
of the ‘world-famous painters’ of
the recent war.

’ His speech is then interrupted
by highly implausible “Huzzahs”
from the crowd, but he puts over
his ideas, , which seem to be
promptly forgotten by the follow-
ing day. And there the story ends,
with Weiss still hanging between
life and death, the community ad-
miring Quill’s. paintings, if not
his opinions, and Quill himself
mourning over the killing of a
fox which he had once released
from a trap.

Plot “is implausible

All very disappointing, jum-
bled, and anything but factual,
although Abbe does present a few
facts worth remembering in spite
of the implausible plot. Chief
complaint is_ that the characters
never talk "'_ about .. anything but
anti—semitism, as if that were the
only subject outside of the weath-
er worth discussing.

Save your $2.50 (price of “Mr.

~ Quill”) and buy a copy of “Gen-
tleman’s Agreement.” It may not .

have all Mr; Abbe’s factual sourc-
es, but it presents the problem a
lot more sensibly and believably.

Both ‘men praised Dr.‘ Parran
as an international leader in the
ﬁeld of public health and added
that his appointment will add
greatly to the prestige of the Uni-
versity as well as the medical

Representatives of the Mellon
fund said no immediate plans for
the building of the school have
been made although a sum of
$5,000,000 has been allocated for
its erection in the medical center
group.

An initial amount of $4,000,000
was made available for procure-
ment of faculty, and an additional
sum of $1,60~0,0»0-0,is set aside for
the ﬁrst ﬁve years. The gift will
be completed with a ﬁnal endow-
ment of $3,000,000 within ﬁve
years” . . . when it appears that
the school has developed from its
initial stages into a successful
undertaking.

It will be the ﬁrst postgraduate
medical school at the University.

institutions in the country, the

best known being the medical

centers at Columbia and John

Cap and Gown-Show Cancelled;
Student Indifference Blamed

One of the University of Pitts-
burgh’s_ famous institutions, the
annual Cap and—Gown show, will

not be seen this year, and the

death of the tradition-steeped club
has been predicted.

_In an announcement concerning’
the» abandoning of plans for this
year’s show, graduate manager
and assistant dean of men, Wil-
liam Saalbach said, ‘ “The future
plans of the Cap_ and Gown club
will be discussed at a general
membership meeting of the grad-
uate Cap and Gown club in th

- very near future.” -

Observers have said this meet-
ing will probably ring down the
ﬁnal curtain on an activity that

hasbeen a part of campus life for

more than 40 years.
Little Student Interest

An “admitted” lack of interest
among the student body and par-
ticularly among the members of
the undergraduate club have been
oﬁered as reasons for the action.

The undergraduate club, once a
major unit on campus, has fallen
to the level where less than half
of its 20 members attend it§'meet—
ings.

Attendance at the past two an-
nual stagings has fallen off con-
siderably, Mr. Saalbach said. Last
year, a loss of several. hundred
dollars ate up I the slight proﬁt
made the year before.

In the ﬁrst post-war show in
"1946, slightly more than 3,000 stu-
dents attended the 11 perform-
ances while more than 12,900 paid
to see the show in its one-week
run at the Nixon in 1940.

In past years, the annual pro-
duction was hailed by drama
critics as one of the city’s ﬁnest

Men's Counci Out Hunting

‘Animals  WiI'houI' Ba<:kbon'es'.

Men’s Council is looking for animals without backbones.
According to Ray Maher, ’manager of the Council book store
which is selling used texts on the "eighth ﬂoor of the Cathedral, they

are not looking under rocks fore

little crawling things_.

“Animals Without Backbones”
is a biology book, written by
Buchbaum, and is one of -several
that are sorely needed by students.

Maher said the lines at the
bookstore show no signs of dimin-
ishing and already the stock of
some critically_ needed ‘texts are
gone.

The bookstore sells second-
hand books at a reduced price.
Men’s Council assumes the sale
of these books which is a source

of some ready cash to the sellers.
Some of the other books that

are in demand are: “The Liter-
ature of America” by Quinn,
Baugh and Howe; “Accounting

Fundamentals” by McFarland and
A y ar s;- “Economic Principles,
Problems, and Policies” by Kick-

musical revues. It has ‘turned out
such celebrities as Gene Kelly,
motion picture star, and Dr. Ben-
jamin Levant, famed» musician,
surgeon, and brother of musician
Oscar Levant.

The club is technically listed as
a non-proﬁt corporation under
Pennsylvania state laws with
g r a d u a t e and undergraduate
groups.

At a meeting earlier this year,
the undergraduate group decided
to abandon the traditional all-
male version of the show, present-
ing their proposal to the executive
group of the graduate club at its
meeting Aug. 30.

At this meeting the executive
board decided to shelf the show
for this year and bring the discus-
sion of future plans before the
entire membership as soon as pos-
sible.

Poor Response

It was revealed that a call to
the Pitt student body for scripts
and music for the coming Decem-
ber production had brought forth
no response. In former years, a

deluge of material was turned in.

Mr. Saalbach said the usual re-

sponse for candidates for the danc-

ing chorus‘ alone was usually

around 60-0 applicants, but for the.

1947 show, only 100 men turned
out I’ for the entire business, pro-
duction, and acting staff.

In the heyday of Cap and Gown,
the downtown. Nixon stage would
be hired for an entire week, but
in recent years the revue was
staged in the Foster Memorial be-
cause it was felt the quality of the
show did not warrant such a'large
scale presentation.

N0 IDS CARDS for SMU

Student identiﬁcation photo
cards wil not be prepared and
distributed in time for the SMU
game tomorrow, according to
Ned Maclntosh of the Dean of
Men’s office.

Ditz, [Ingrim to Help 
Approve Speakers

By LEROY WEINER
University policy on political
speakers climbs into .its ﬁrst pair
of long pants this fall- As part of
a revised program adopted at the
end of the spring semester, speak-
ers on political and other contro-
Versial issues will be permitted on
campus. _

In line with the new program
Student Congress this week elect-
ed Jean Ditz and Robert Ingrim
as student representatives to the
new Committee on Meetings and
Speakers. , ‘

1 Apointment of Theodore Biddle,
dean of men, to the chairmanship
was announced last spring. Two
faculty positions and two -admin-
istrative offices are still vacant.

‘ Demandsfor a University stand
on politicalspeakers began early
last November, when Student
Congress was stymied in its ef-
forts to have Henry Wallace speak
on campus.

Congress ran into a University
wall established years ago. The
stumbling block was a policy
which forbade sponsoring of po-
litical speakers. Wallace ended up
at Carnegie Music Hall and the
political hot—potato_went to a com-
mittee appointed by the Chancel-

_ lor.

After. cooling off in committee
session for several months, the
issue reappeared about the middle

of last May. Chancellor R. H. Fitz-

A
V

BOB INGRIIVI '
Two were chosen

gerald stated in a smessage that
political speakers would be al-
lowed on campus withthe under-

endorsed by the University.
Final decision on speakers rests
with the chairman of the Commit-
tee on Meetings and Speakers.
Organizations desiring to arrange
for the appearance of "speakers
will be required to notify him

beforehand.

V,

...for 21 years! .

“It may seem like along time to you . . . but to me it’s
just like- yesterday that I started. '

“Guess that’s because it’s always been_interesting . . .‘
always so many phases of the business to learn. . .
always something different and vital to do.

“Right now I’m one of 125,000 men and women who
have been in telephony for 21 years or more. They call
us the ‘Telephone Pioneers of America."

“I’ve seen the telephone industry come a long way-
improving methods, developing new means of com-
munications, constantly growing. But in many ﬁelds
We’ve hardly scratched the surface; were still "pioneer-
ing. The future is full of challenges, and opportunities!”

. LOOKING

Throughout the ages men have been seeking

the ‘Fountain of Youth.

Maybe we’ll ﬁnd itsome day. Certainly scien-
tists and doctors have already greatly length-

ened our life span.

If we only could ﬁnd it and have eternal youth,
it would save us a lot of trouble. We’d never
have to plan for old age--because We’d never

grow old.

But meanwhile all of us still face the problem
of economic security for the future.

For most of us the only solution is regular
saving, And there is no better, safer, or more
painless way to save than through the auto-
matic purchase of U. S._.,Savings Bonds on the

Payroll Savings Plan.

Ask about it where you Work. Or if you are in .
business or a profession ask about the Bond-
A-l\Ionth Plan Where you bank.

After you sign up, the money saves itself——and.
every $3 becomes $4 at the end of 10 years.

And what’s more, even if you had that Foun-
tain of Youth, the money you’d save would be
great for emergencies or for things like that
new home, or the children’s education.

So even ‘if you think eternal youth is just

around the corner, joining one of the Bond
Plans today is a Wonderful idea“ for getting

the things you want.

News Forecast

Fall and widespread study of
Deke Houlgate, ~Dr. Litkenhaus,
et al, have become almost syn-
onymous. , .

Thousands pound their heads
against stone-wall odds of 3,485,-
784,401 to 1 in newspaper football
selection contests, seemingly ob-
livious ' of the straight dope on
such matters published weekly in
the sacred sports columns of the

So famous have these grid yogis
become that the parasitic Panther

in on the glory.

Freshman Seated Contributed
Fifteen to Current Vorsty

Last year’s freshman football
proved a valuable
source of material for ‘the present
.’ 15 gridders from
the 1947 frosh outfit now being
members.
Most promising is Tackle Nick
Bolkovac, who has already crack-
ed the starting lineup.

A pair of centers, George Ra-
dosevich and George Steingraber,

In addition to Bolkovac, other
‘tackles include Bob Mihin, George
Gallino, and Ray Johnson. This
trio of ,20-0-pounclers will bolster
an all-important slot. '

There should be no shortage of
adequate guard reinforcements on
the Panther eleven. Charles Yost,
Flint Greene, and Laurice Pierce
serve as soph replacements in this
category.

Marching Band
To Vary Fare  
With Swing  

An answer to university jive

hounds will be provided tomor-_

row in a ‘surprise offering by the
varsity marching band. Always a
major attraction at the stadium
the 120 piece band will help the
gridders open the 1948 season in
an S.M.U. manner.

, Featured besides the surprise
will be two pregame formations
after entering in a new silent tight
block formation. A half time sa-
lute to the Texans will climax the
opening day festivities.

Robert L. Arthur, band direc-
tor, has insisted on systematic pro-
cedure in sound of the music, and
military precision in. the forma-
tions during the past few weeks
of preparation. , ‘

Formations by Ackenheil

Seven straight Saturdays, four
formations each game, and band
arrangements by the bundle are
ahead of Mr. Arthur and his staff.
Marching perfection is handled by
Capt. J. D. Hunter while Profes-
sor Alfred C. Ackenheil develops
the intricate formations.

In the past" the student body
and public have marvelled at the
ﬁne music produced by the march-
ing band. Mr. Arthur explained
“This is no easy accomplishment,
especially in the stadium where
the. acoustics are ‘very hard ‘to
manage. This is the reason we
march in without playing”.

Left With Echo

Mr. Arthur claims the music
bounces back from the opposite
end zone and then the rear of the
band is left playing the echo. Sam

-Quigléy, top arranger, has done
much to adapt the sound so as to
not confuse the musicians.

_While the marching band visits
Western Reserve and Ohio State
only two visitors are anticipated
.here. West Virginia will be here
for the ﬁrst time in years, and the
Penn State blue band‘will appear
for the season ﬁnale.

Funeral Today for Student
Who Died in Plane Crash

Franklin J. Langsdale, a Pitt

senior, was killed Tuesday when

his plane plunged 400 feet to the
ground as he approached the But-
ler Airport during a solo ﬂight.

Funeral services will be held
this afternoon at 2 o’clock.

Langsdale was taking a test for
his pilot’s' license when the tragedy
occurred. He’ had been active in
University affairs and would have
graduated in February.

Observers said the plane went
into a spin and fell between two
houses near the Deshon Veterans’
Hospital. Rescuers worked for
nearly an hour to remove the body
from the wreckage of the‘ plane.

Worked on Publications

Frank, a News staff writer,
owned the "plane jointly with an-
other Pitt student, Clement J.
Larkin, News photographer, and
Donald Springer. They purchased
the PT-19 from the army this
summer. ‘

Officials at the airport said rain
and poor visibility may have had
something to do with the crash.
Langsdale was described as “a
very capable” ipilot.

' A journalism major, Langsdale
was prominent in campus publi-
cations. He was assistant circula-
tion manager of the Owl, edited
the Alumni News Review and the
Independent Association Gee-Dee-
Eye. He was a member of Pi Delta
Epsilon, national honorary jour-
nalism fraternity. ‘

Served in Air Forces
Other campus activities in which
he ﬁgured were the Spring Fes-
tival committee, Lutheran Stu-
dent Association, and the Inde-
pendent Association Council. He

served in the Air Forces and was

discharged Dec. 6, 1945.

He is survived by his parents,
Mr. and Mrs. F. A. Langsdale, and
a sister Dorothy. Friends. are be-
ing received at the Frank W. Si-
mons Funeral Home, 2025 Perry_s-
ville Avenue.

Johnny 'Long (Duke University—Sigma Nu) comes up
with a danceable, bright bounce. It’s a Long original!
If you should ask Johnny how he came to write it, he’ll light
up a Camel and say: “Experience! I know from

 

experience what music suits my band best-
just as Itlearned from experience that Camels
suit my ‘T-Zone’ to a ‘T’.”
Try Camels on your “T-Zone”,—“T” for taste,

Johnny Long and millions of other smokers,
Camels are the “choice of experience.”
