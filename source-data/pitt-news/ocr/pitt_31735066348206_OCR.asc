BY SCOTT MACLEOD

Chancellor Wesley W. Posvar, in
a statement Friday to the Univer-
sity community "on the Black Stud-
ies chairmanship controversy, en-
dorsed the decision of FAS Dean
Jerome Rosenberg to appoint Ro-
land Smith to the post instead of
Curtiss Porter.

Posvar’s statement was the offi-
cial response to the situation given
to black students who had protes-
ted Rosenberg’s_ decision in '1
meeting with him one week before.
They contend the FAS dean made
the decision contrary to the interest
of the black community to name to
the post Curtiss Porter, a member
and-co-founder of the black studies
department.

The ofﬁcial statement, added no
immediate decision on the chair-
manship could be made because of

Voter's Guide for

Tuesday State Election

BY KEN GORMLEY

-rt"-.

Oakland voters go to the polls
tomorrow to ﬁll the most important

- government ofﬁces in the state; US

senator, governor, lieutenant gov-
ernor, US representative and var-
ious local congressional seats.‘

GOVERNOR

Incumbent Governor Milton J.
Shapp, attempting to be the ﬁrst
Pennsylvania governor in over 100
years to serve two consecutive
terms, will face his most formid-
able opponent in Republican Drew
Lewis, a Montgomery County busi-
nessrrtan.

Shapp, still trying to terminate the
“smear campaign” investigations
into his contract awarding policies,
points to his accomplishments as
governor as proof of his unques-
tionable credentials. The Shapp
administration, which the governor
labels an “open and efﬁcient
government" boasts such achieve-
ments as pulling the bankrupt state
of Pennsylvania out of a $900
million debt, dealing successfully
with the disaster of Hurricane
\ gnes, and the governor's person-
al mediation and resolution of the
trucker’s strike.

Drew Lewis has_ run most of his
campaign on an anti-corruption
stand. Shapp’s administration,
Lewis claims, “is the most corrupt

. in my lifetime.” In addition, Lewis

death penalty.

has repeatedly attacked Shapp’s
“profligacy,” contending he could
save millions in welfare expendi-
tures if elected.

The candidates have also showed
a difference of conviction on sever-
al other important issues. ,
CAPITAL PUNISHMENT. Lewis
said he would have signed and
enforced the limited capital pun-
ishment bill Shapp vetoed earlier
this year. The bill called for certain
speciﬁc crimes such as police and
prison guard slayings to be punish-

able by death. Lewis said, “Capi-

tal punishment is a deterrent to
crime.”

Shapp’s views are different on the
“It is well known
that I vetoed the current law,” he
said. “I could support only ‘a very
limited capital punishment bill.”
ABORTION. Shapp vetoed two

abortion control laws introduced in‘

the state legislature during hi
term. He is, however, not in favon_
of abortion on demand. 

Lewis takes a middle stance ort
abortion. He would favor abortiori
if a birth would harm the mother’s
health, or in the case of rape or
incest. ‘
EDUCATION. Shapp feels that,
due to changes which took place
primarily during his Administra-
tion, Pennsylvania has one of the
finest systems of public education
in the country. ' '

Lewis feels the system of public
education does have the potential

ni(‘Continued on Page 3)

a "danger of polarization among-
faculty, student, and community
groups," which would hinder an
objective academic deliberation.
The Black Action Society delivered
early today a letter to Posvar
criticizing his action. After taking
issue with several parts of the
statement, BAS expressed the
need to meet with the Chancellor
informally on the matter. I

“We are concerned with thefast
and rising epidemic of opinion and
misinformation concerning the is-
sue of Black Studies and student
involvement. As rapidly as possi-
ble, we need to communicate,” the
letter read.

In an interview yesterday, Gray-
lyn Swilley, BAS chairperson, said
she hoped to meet with Posvar
sometime this week to make sever-

.al proposals concerning the black

community at Pitt.

Swilley outlined two proposals
explaining the concern was much
broader than only the appointment
of Curtiss Porter as chairman.
Involved was the need for a dean of
urban minority affairs, who would
oversee several black related agen-
cies at Pitt, including BAS, the
black studies department, New
Careers, OBASF, and UCEP.

After Posvar’s announcement last
week, Rosenberg declined to spec-

A study commission to examine
whether the Pitt News is adequat-
ely serving the campus community
or whether its structure should be
altered, has been charged by Vice
Chancellor of Student Affairs
Alfred Moye, ‘

According to Moye, the commis-
sion’s examinations will be done in
an unbiased manner employing
complete candor, without presum-
ing any-pre-existing conditions or
problems. It will function strictly
as an advisory committee, with the
power only to recommend changes
in the function and role of the Pitt
News. ‘

Possible areas for study by the
commission are:

T The identiﬁcation of a stable,
reasonable funding basis for the
Pitt News which provides sufficient

money for operation while insuring

the maintenance of a free student
press.

T Thelclarification and codiﬁcation
of the Pitt News’ relationship with
Student Government and the
University.

T An examination of the recent
legal precedents that have sharp-
ened the deﬁnition of the obliga-
tions and rights of the collegiate
press with respect to the campus

Sweetman vs Romanelli

BY KEN GORMLEY

In one of the few elections which
appear to give Oakland voters a
choice between two clearly differ-
ent candidates, incumbent James
Rom-anelli is opposed by Republi-
can Robert C. Sweetman for his
22nd ‘District seat, representing
South Oakland, in the State House
of Representatives.

In the 19th District, including Pitt
Campus, Hill District Attorney K;
Leroy lrvis, Democrat incumbent,
is unopposed and is virtually
certain to retain his seat.

Romanelli stands firmly on his
perfect attendance record in the
House, and the diversity of inter-
ests he displayed in voting. The
incumbent representative‘ pointed
out he has supported “no-fault
insurance, legislation to protect the
consumer, and fought diligently for
additional aid to students.” These
and similar accomplishments, he
said, have been the basis for his
platform. But Romanelli conclu-
ded, “I still have no idea what his

(Sweetman’s) platform is.”
Sweetman, a newcomer to poli-
tics, who has a BA in history from
Pitt, pointed tp his honest, self-
managed campaign as an indica-

have no real past achievements to
point to. This is my ﬁrst run,”
Sweetman said. But he‘ also
pointed out he has spend a “whop-
ping total" of $27._41 on his
campaign, giving him the freedom
from political corruption he de-
sires. “I don't owe one cent in
favors to anybody but the voters
and taxpayers,” he said.

As further proof of his intention to
work closely with the people,
Sweetman said, “In running my
campaign, I have been to over
3,400’ homes, and I’m in the
process of wearing down my fourth
pair of shoes.” This affinity for the
people, Sweetman promised,
would be his trademark if elected.

A closer view of the two candi-
dates’ different political outlooks
was furnished in separate inter-
views with the Pitt News.

MASS TRANSIT

The incumbent 22nd District Rep-
resentative favored mass transit,
but saw no need for pouring in new
funds. “Not having mass transit is
choking the economy of this area,"
said Romanelli, “but I don't think
we have to increase funding, just
spend the money which was 7 al-
ready allocated and is dormant.”
He also pointed out this might also
serve to stimulate the sagging
economy. .

Although Sweetman, too, saw
room for budget cuts in some areas
of mass transit. he generally favor-
ed more spending designed to
utilize the already-existing transit

: facilities which are going to waste.

HOME RULE

Romanelli, who has publicly en-
dorsed Pittsburg.h’s proposed
Home Rule charter, said he was
deﬁnitely in favor of Home Rule.
l’ll admit the charter is no panacea,
but it’s a step in the right
direction.” ,

Sweétman, who says he has kept
abreast of the issue since its_,.
advent, also felt the plan was a step
in the right direction, but a step
which wasn’t nearly big enough.
“I'd love to see Home Rule and
independence in Pittsburgh, but
I'm voting against the charter. I've
never yet heard of Home Rule in
any other area which doesn’t allow
the regulation of it’s own school
system. It’s a totally inadequate
charter.” Sweetman concluded he
was not willing to accept a Charade
of such an important policy.

GOALS AS STATE
REPRESENTATIVE

Romanelli pledged he will con-
tinue to serve.the people as he has
in the past. “I am a full time
legislator who has a perfect atten-
dance record. As I have always
done, I will vote and act not
necessarily as my own conscience —
might tell me, but as I know my
constituents would want me to vote
and act.”

Sweetman stated several concrete
endeavors he hopes to undertake as
soon as he is elected, the main one
being an all-out campaign against
the “lack of integrity, in both
Democrats and Republicans"
which exists in government. He
also mentioned some speciﬁc pro-
grams he felt need to be initiated.
“I would like to see, rather than
public funding of elections, the
outright expulsion of any politician
who doesn't report every cent of
contributions. I would like to
sponsor a bill to require industries
to give advance notice of at least 90
days toiwarn people that they’re
going to be laid-off. And I hope to
see a bill passed: which woul.
re—create the depression era Home7
Owners Loan Association, provid-
ing one or two percent interest on
loans that the average person can’t
afford to take out of the bank at the

to be one of the best in the nation,
if it were taken out of the control of
partisan politicians. Lewis pledges
to return schools to local control,
and to increase the size of family
limits of PHEAA grants for higher
education to meet inflated tuitions.

Also running for governor under
the Constitutional Party is Stephen
Dcpuc. a public relations man from
Montrose. in Susquehanna County.
Roberta Scherr. Socialist Workers
Party Candidate for Governor does
not meet age regulations for a spot
on the ballot. but is available as a
write-in candidate.

LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR

The major contenders for this
position are Democrat Erne’st P.
Kline. Governor Shapp's running
mate, and GOP candidate Kenneth
B. Lee.

Kline, the present lieutenant gov-
crnor, was the unopposed choice
for this slot in his party's May
primary, and is considered an
integral part of the Shapp adminis-
tration’s successes.

The Republican candidate is at-
torney Kenneth B. Lee, presently
Speaker of the State House of
Representatives.

Other candidates for lieutenant
governor are Constitutional Party
member Ellis L. Werft, and Fred-
erick W. Stanton, running under
the banner of the Socialist Workers
Party.

Werft claims his opponents are
typical big government men who
accept the socialistic trend of
government, while he is interested
in returning government to its
smaller divisions. I

Stanton attacks the Republican.

and Democratic parties and their
candidates as supporters of the
capitalist system, which he said
causes inflation, unemployment,
racism, sexism and war. He points
out the Socialist Workers Party
stands in complete opposition to
the capitalist system and attempts
to fight against the profit-gougers
and their government.

US SENATE
Pittsburgh Mayor Pete Flaherty is
seeking to replace incumbent
Senator Richard Schweiker for one
of Pennsylvania's two US senator-

ial seats.

‘Flaherty, in his second term as
mayor, is most well known for his
image of political “maverick."
often def_ving both the Democratic
and Republican machines. In his
first term, the Mayor cut taxes by
$20 million, decreased the city's
crime rate, and ended both 1972
and 1973 with budget surpluses of
over $10 million.

Schweiker, a junior senator, has
continuously stood up for Pennsyl-
vania industries in order to save
jobs from unfair foreign competi-
tion, voted for every major amend-
ment to end the war in Vietnam,
and co-sponsored the Black Lung
Benefits program. _

The two candidates have shown
similiar opposition to abortion on
demand and President Ford's pro-
posed S"/o Surcharge, but each
pointed out how his term in office
might differ from that of his
opponent.

Senator Schw,eil<.er said. .“I have
my record to indicate what 111 do."
He felt it was up to Flaherty to state
his platform, but didn’t believe the
Mayor had done so yet.

Flaherty pointed out several
things his opponent did in office
which he would avoid, if elected.
“First of all, Mr. Schweiker has
voted for a deﬁcit budget, and he
has been an excessive spender,
contributing to inflation. He has
gone along with the government in
Washington, and that’s why we’re
in the greatest economic slump of
our nation’s history. And I don’t

‘feel my opponent has initiated any

meaningful programs. He simply
waits to see which way the wind is
blowing.”

Pitt Undergraduate Christina
Adachi, Socialist Workers Party
Candidate for US Senator, was also
disqualified from regular balloting
because ofithe age restrictions, but
is available as a write-in candidate.

Moorhead, a member of Congress
since 1958. is noted for his interest
in social welfare programs. and has
worked on legislation for consumer

Davis, a life-long political scien-

ed in the welfare of the J&L worker

not the Japanese are happy. If they

Both Moorhead and his opponent
favor Home Rule and federal

some respects.

The Congressman pointed to one
clear difference in opinion which
was brought up in several of the
debates he had with his opponent.

tial funds rather than “the major

In general, Moorhead felt the
major difference between him and

his opponent was easily defined.

“I like to think that I am a

represents the Republican

On the latter point, Davis seemed
to be in agreement. “We disagree

on the basic approach to govern-

Passable Home Rule Charter

BY BILL MOORE

Pittsburgh voters are, as voters
have a tendency to be, wholly
unaware of what the Home Rule
Charter they will be asked to accept
or reject next» week is all about.

The charter is a result of nearly
two years of work, hundreds of
meetings and hearings, and exten-
sive compromise on’the part of an
11-member Government Study
Commission. I

The proposal agreed on by the
commission is, in the words of
commission chairman John Bing-
let, “the best passable rather than
the best possible charter.”

If passed in the November 5
election, the Charter will do many
things, and not surprisingly will
leave many things undone. .

The Charter will allow the city of
Pittsburgh to govern itself after 158
years of. dependence on the state
legislature, but this new power
may or may not be beneﬁcial to the
citizens of Pittsburgh. It is not as
important who governs the city, as
it is how the city is governed.

The Charter will not tip the
balance of power within city gov-
ernment. The strong mayor form
of rule in this city will remain
intact. and, in a few areas, will be
strengthened.

The Charter will simplify the
immensely confusing jumble of city
ordinances under the old city
charter. This is one of the few
definite pluses.

The Charter will not enact the
much called for by-district council
elections. An earlier draft of the
Charter proposed election of city
council members by the districts in

Squirrel Hill and area would be
limited to one council member
elected by residents of that area,
while many areas with no rep-
resentation presently would be
guaranteed it in the future.

The present Home Rule proposal

leaves intact the at--large system of;

council elections, prompting one
commission member to submit a
minority report calling the Charter
“meaningless.” The NAACP has
also gone on record in opposition to
the charter claiming at-large elec-
tions seriously hinder chances of
minority representation. The pres-
ent Charter does, in all fairness,
allow council themselves to"‘by

ordinance decide that all members '

shall be elected by district.” But to
many council members this would
threaten their jobs, and it is safe to

.assume they would think twice

before taking such a step.

The Charter will set up Commun-
ity Advisory Boards which will
allow citizen involvement. The
boards will come from districts
selected by council and will advise
both the council and the mayor.
The boards will receive no tax,
money and board members willi
serve without pay. These gloriﬁed
neighborhood action groups are a
step in the right direction, but in
actuality, no one says council and
the mayor must listen to what the
boards have to say. The boards
stand the risk of being just a few
more voices falling on the same old
deaf ears.

Lastly, the Charter will not cost .

taxpayers any more money.
The question remains, then,
whether voters should approve a

'  less thangideal Home Rule Charter ,_

a Letter to
the Editor

To Whom it May Concern:

On Saturday, October 19 during
the Boston College game, a very
disturbing incident occurred. A-
bout midway through the game, a
vendor was accosted by several
students in the lower portion of
Section 16.

From our vantage point [Section
15] we noted that aside from being

verbally and physically harrassedu

the young vendor also “lost” most
of his merchandise. However, the
actions of the students involved
were less disturbing than those of
the police who witnessed the
assault.

Four policemen, two city and two
Pinkerton security ofﬁcers viewed

, J":

the actions from the area of the -

ﬁeld directly below Section 16. The
police were aware of what was
happening but took no measures to
control the outburst. Access to the

area in which the skirmish took

place was easy enough. .
A ramp leading from the fiel
would have provided the necessary

’ route. The incident could have

been easily and quickly controlled.
The question remains, “Why
wasn’t it?’’. i

ls_the purpose, of the police and
security guards at the stadium to‘
conﬁscate bottles and watch the
game only? We feel that the police
were inadequate in their services,
and would like to advise that they
take their job more seriously in the
future.

Yours truly,
The Table

merely because it is a step in the
right direction, or reject the Char-
ter in hopes of a new proposal with
stronger plusses and less minuses.

Unfortunately, as much as a

stronger, more individual-oriented

Charter would be desirable, the
all-or-nothing-at-all attitude does’
not work in politics. If this Charter
is rejected, like the controversial
County Home Rule Charter which
was dramatically defeated last
May, chances are it will not surface
again for quite some time. And
when it does, the new government
study commission will no doubt
misinterpret the voters’ objections
and propose an all-new, toned-
down Charter with even less solid
improvement.

Passage of the present Charter
proposal, therefore, would be a less
than ideal development, but the
best option the voters have.
Pittsburgh voters would at least be
given the framework on which to
build the form of municipal gov-
ernment they claim to want--one
that listens to the individual ‘and
works’ to meet the individual’s
needs. You can't expect to win the
war in one battle; but winji the
battle, and the end is that niiuch
nearer. '

A $1 million grant to Pitt’s
Center for Research in Primate
Reproduction will be used to gain

.‘'*-new [understanding about human
reproduction according to Physiol-
ogy Department Chairman Ernst
Knobil.

The five-year grant from the,

National Institute of Child Health
and Human Development of the US
Department of Health, Education,
and Welfare, establishes the new
center at Pitt as one of only ten
federally funded Population Re-
search Centers in the United
States, and the only one to support

' facilities specifically designed for
study of primate ‘reproductive

' physiology.

' Dr. Knobil noted that although
3"’-‘the grant began the first of
October, we’ve been working on
this subject for the past 15 years.”
The research in primate repro-
duction will ultimately lead to new
knowledge which will make possi-
ble safe, more effective control of

fertility andinfertility problems in
humans. Rhesus monkeys are used
in the research because their
reproductive cycles most‘ closely
resemble those of humans, and

findings from the experimental,

animals can thus more readily be
extrapolated to man.

Much of the research on which
medical science based its earlier
views on human reproduction was
done on animals such as rodents

which differ in important ways.

from humans in their reproductive
systems.

“Since primates (monkeys) so
much ‘moreclosely resemble

humans {in their reproductive

systems, the research being done
here at Pitt can shed new light on

our understandingof human

reproduction," Dr. Knobil said.
“This can lead to safer and more
effective methods of birth control,
as‘ well as better treatment of
infertility. ”

Whether you're still in medical school with the
rigors of three to ﬁve years of graduate medical edu-
cation still to be faced, or are already a practicing
physician, it’s our opinion that the Air Force can
offer both professional and personal satisfaction
hard to duplicate in civilian life.

An overstatement? Not ifyou consider the
speciﬁcs.

Take the problem of graduate medical educa-
tion. It’s a period ofyour life the Air Force can make
considerably easier with comfortable salary and liv-
ing conditions.

Creature comforts aside, the Air Force offers
professional advantages. Besides receiving training
in your own specialty, you'd be in contact with
physicians in all of the medical specialties. You’ll
function in an environment which is intellectually

_ stimulating and“ professionally challenging.

Not all physicians pursue post residency fellow-
ships. Butif you are interested, the Air Force con-
ducts them both in—house and atcivilian institutions.

The physician already in practice can look for-
ward to other things. If you want training in the
practice of the medicine of the future, you'll ﬁnd it

, in the Air Force. For example, there's emphasis on

group medicine and-preventive medicine, and the
growing specialty of “family physician." Whatever

.., your interest, there are few specialties which are not
‘ being practiced in today's Air Force.

-  'The physician starting his practice in civilian

u .~ wlife has to take into accountthe cost of setting up an

go with it.

, the Air Force does not. He ﬁnds his office established

for him. Supplies and equipment readily available.
He has many options available to him when treating
patients. For example, he can consult with Air Force
specialists. He also has referral to other Air Force
facilities via aeromedical evacuation. Last, but not
least, are the satisfactions that come with having
the opportunity for regular follow-ups, and a missed
appointment rate that is practically nil.

Whether you are already a physician, or soon to
become one, you might ﬁnd it extremely interesting
to ﬁnd out what the Air Force has to offer. We think
it could be a real eye—opener. If you'll mail in the cou-
pon, we’d be happy to send you detailed information.

“Where else in the University. do

effort, except maybe the football
team, it takes to bring a production
together? And there you don't
have_ that extra measure, the
artistic principle, involved.

“What's most important about
theatre is that sense of ensemble,"
Elvgren said, choosing words care-
fully, “That's the most importan_t

relationship between people is
right and good and loving and

A Director with Unique Style

Frank McCarty’s musical direction‘,
a chilling nervous energy pulses
through the productions making
lsherwood’s decadent Berlin come

-"alive.

Cabaret is a 24-hour a day job for
Elvgren, and in the true artist's
tradition, he has literally turned
problems with the production over
to his subconscious, solving them
while asleep.

As Cabaret pulls into its final
three days of rehearsal, straining

, for the November 7 opening, Gil

Elvgren is a remarkably calm man.
“We’re into now the real crunch
of finding. costuming, ' lighting set
pieces, making it all fit, all WORK. 
Things are beginning to converge I ’
rapidly, it's the crunch time, and
its particularly trying on the actors.
I try not to show pressure for their
sake.” \
By Friday night’s dress parade,
the cast was ready for its first
run-through in costume: 13 scenes
in Act I, seven in Act II, and ten
musical numbers. 4
Trained in documentary theatre at
the Victoria Theatre in Strope-on-
Trent, England, one of Elvgren’s
next projects is writing and prepar-
ing a documentary play of Pitts-
burgh for the University Theatre’s
Winter production in 1976, 
expression, in Elvgren’s opinion, of 
theatre’s “obligation to look to its
roots.”
Elvgren also has a children’s'
theatre production in the works for
this winter, which he will write,
direct, and produce. Children’s '_
theatre excites Elvgren" because
they appreciate it so: “Children ,
have no preconception of what , 
theatre should be. They watch 
theatre with JOY.” ‘
He brings joy to theatre and
passion, butElvgren remains un-
consumed'by it. “I have found

“and that is Christ._” And the

Mime Troupe“Speciks"

The San Francisco Mime Troupe,
America’s oldest street theater,
will bring its blend of bold political
statement and frantic physical
comedy to Pittsburgh on Nov. 4 and
5.

The Mime Troupe, which despite
its name is, very vocal, will be
presenting the‘ first major US
production of Bertolt Brecht’s The
Mother since 1935. This controver-
sial play tells the story of a working

‘ class Russian mother, and how she

becomes involved in the revolu-
tionary struggle between 1905 and
1917. The production utilizes the.
crowd-gathering techniques which
the Mime Troupe has perfected
over its 12 years of open-air theater
-- music, comedy, topical asides,
and even juggling.

Famous for presenting plays
about up-to-the-minute issues, the
Mime Troupe will also be perform-
ing an original “Marx vs. Martians
detective thriller,” The Great Air
Robbery, which features a black
private eye, electric rock, and
karate.

 

On November 6 THE MEDICINE
SHOW THEATRE ENSEMBLE
initiates the-‘ﬁrst season of THE
PITTSBURGH $.99 FLOATING
THEATRE FESTIVAL. They will
perform Medicine Show on Nov-
ember 6 and 7 and Frogs on
November 8, 9, and 10 in, The
Dance Studio, Trees Hall, Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh at 7:30 pm each
night. A $.99 donation will be taken
at the door and no reservations are
needed.

Medicine Show, the first work to
be created by the Ensemble since
its division from the Open Theatre,
was nominated for an Obie in 1973.
The piece draws upon that
peculiarly American mixture of

.hucksterism and entertainment--

the medicine show--for its struc-.
ture. Within this form ‘the
performers explore Patriotism,
Home, Oz, -George Washington,
gangsterism, including the Wizard
himself, in order to reveal the
violence, hero worship and inno-
cence of an American conscious-
ness. '

The Ensemble’s second collective
creation is Frogs, a comic piece
about change. It was created by the
group, with Carl Morse as

writer-in-collaboration, and direc- '

ted by James Barbosa. Through a
series of “leaps” the characters
investigate change in relation to
their lives, emotions, politics and
society. The play is nonlinear and
parallels Aristophanes’ Frogs in its
use of serious themes in a comic

‘mode. The “joumey” metaphor

and the simultaneously existing

‘worlds yield fresh perceptions of

arose to meet the need for
professional theatre free from the
expectations enforced by a high-

chure makes the point that “other
artists have galleries free and open
to their audiences; performing
artists often don’t. We wanted a

BY G. w. STEVENS
Associate Sports Editor
On Saturday afternoon the Syra-
cuse Orangemen gave the Panthers
one of their fiercest struggles of the
season as they battled in decadent
Archbold Stadium, but the Orange

faltered in the second half enabling
the Panthers to run their winning
streak" to four. The enthusiastic
Syracuse squad ‘wasn'tiable to
build on their 10-7 halftime lead as
the Panthers scored two touch-
downs for a 21-13 victory.

eption in Saturday’s 21-13 win over

6;,‘ 2nd Consecutive. Win

Although the Panthers played
much of the second_ half without the
services of Tony Dorsett who left
the game with an ankle sprain,
Syracuse was unable to grasp the
upset as their record fell to a dismal
2-7 mark. And, the chances of a
bowl bid for the Panthers were kept
alive by the victory which raise the
Cats record to 6-2.

“We played a very
football team today,"

scrappy
said Pitt

coach Johnny Majors after the 3

game. “Syracuse played quite well
so we really had to play hard to
win. I'm very proud of this football
team. If we had lost the football
game, I'd still be pleased with our
performance."

During the opening series of the
game, it looked as though the
Panthers would dominate their
weaker_ opponent. The Cats took
the opening kickoff and drove 63
yards in 13 plays for a quick
touchdown. The Pitt offense kept
the ball on the ground with Dorsett
and fullback Bob Hutton grinding
from the Pitt 37 to their opponents
20. A ﬁfteen yard strike from Billy

‘ Daniels to Bruce Murphy was the

only pass of the drive placing‘ the
ball on the five.

Three plays later Dorsett scooted
to his left and outran a Syracuse

defender to the endzone. Carson‘

Long added a kick to make it 7-0, a
lead that didn’t last long.
Syracuse came right back with

  Booters Top Gannon, 53-1

BY ANDY BEHREND
Overcoming field conditions more
suitable to house a roller-coaster
than soccer players, Pitt's booters,
put together their first two-game

we

win streak of the season, defeating ~

Gannon College of Erie, Saturday,
3-1. The victory evened the
Panthers‘ slate at 4-4-2, with two
games remaining.

For the first 20 minutes of the
contest, Pitt seemed more befudd-
led by the rocky, sloping field than
by the Knights. The tricky footing
decreased much of the ball-
handling skills which the P-anthers
usually maintain.

Pitt got on the scoreboard first, ‘
with 31 minutes elapsed in the first

 half. . -

John Wallace, whose playmaking
was an asset to Pitt all afternoon,
passed to halfback Tom Murphy on
the left side. ‘From about 25 yards
away, Murphy drilled a shot which
nestled just inside the left post, for
a 1-0 lead.’

The rest of the half was scoreless,
as the Panther defense did an
excellent job in muffling the taller
Gannon attackers.

Both teams started off slowly in
the second half, but again Pitt
broke the scoring drought, this
time with a beautiful play.

At 65:16, with Pitt on the move,

~ John Morahan dribbled up left
wing, put a move on his defender,
and crossed a high ball to his
opposite winger, Bill Rex. The
senior from Glenshaw headed it
past a badly beaten Tim Patterson,
the Knight goalie, _for a. most
picturesq.ue,s:core..  — ‘ '

H_fullbacks.’.j' " _ P

  

Gannon broke goalie Frank
Bucci’s shutout with a disputed
tally at 74 minutes. With the
Knights finally penetrating Pitt’s
defense, Walter Turnier hitch-
kickedfrom in close past Bucci to

cut the lead in half.
Pitt complained Turnier’s kick.
‘ was a dangerous play because his

feet were practically in Tom Mur-
phy’s face after the kick. I A The
referees said no, and Gannon had
their only score of the afternoon.

Five minutes later, Pittrounded
out the scoring, when Wallace split
the Knight defense and passed
John‘ Curley, who beat Patterson
coming out to meet the ball. Curley
merely ran the ball into the net for
his ﬁfth score this year.

Gannon Coach Rich Wrobel, in his '

first season at Gannon, gave credit
to Pitt for hampering his team’s
style of play.‘

“Pitt played a wide open game,
which just isn’t our game," Wrobel
said. “We like to play ball control
and we could not do that today.”

Leo Bemis was not as pleased as
he might have been at his team’s
victory. He bemoaned the ﬁeld
conditions as the reason his club
failed to break the game open, thus
limiting his substitutions.

“If we’d have made our early
shots, we could have subbed
more,” Bemis said, noting that
only Nick Chrisanthon entered the
contest as a sub.

“I was pleased at our (offensive)
line play,” he said, “especially
when they got the ball from the

   

The-game marked the last away
tilt for seniors Bill Rex, Jerry
Luxbacher and Mark Venanzi. It

.was only fitting that these three,

who have played superbly all year,
were rewarded with a win.

Pitt returns home next Saturday to
host Indiana U. of "PA. with a
chance to go over the .500 mark for
the first time this season. _ The
game will be played in Pitt Stadium
immediately following the Pitt-
Temple football game.

BY ROBIN MILES

Avenging their loss of a few
weeks ago, Penn State’s Women's
Volleyball A team, edged the Pitt
Pantherettes, 2-1, Saturday at
Trees Hall.‘

Pitt won the first game 17-15. At
one point they led 14-4, but were
unable to seal the victory with the
final point, despiteexcellent spike
shots. Penn State persisted and
managed to tie the score at 14-14,
but Pitt pulled together to finally
win it. Mitzi Frye was the high
scorer for Pitt, with 6 points.

The eight minute time limit ran
out on the second game, with
neither team leading by the two
points, necessary for the win.
Penn, utilizing some well placed
shots scored two points and won

The third game proved to be a
continuation of the second, with the
lead changing hands frequently.
With the score tied at 13-13, Penn
State took the next two points and
the game, 15-13. High scorer for
Pitt was Jamie Andrews with 4
points.

Coach Mary Kromer said it was a
good match, but “we should have
won. it.”.

In B team action, Pitt blanked
Penn State 2-0, topping the first
game 15-11, and the second 16-14.
“The first time they played Penn

for 31 yards to the Orange nine.
After Daniels was stopped for no
gain and Dorsett was helped off the

ﬁeld with his ankle injury, Daniels
found Jim Corbett on the goal line
and the big tightend battled past
three defenders for the touchdown.
Long made it 19 for 21 in extra
points this season giving the
Panthers a much deserved 14-10
lead.

“Daniels just went the opposite
way of the backs on that busted
play,” said Majors of the play that
put the Panthers ‘within range of
the winning touchdown. “We
stress the fact that if you make a
mistake, make it happen aggres-
sively. Like for 31 yards.”

The Orange added another ﬁeld
goal in the fourth quarter after
Hodge pulled in his second

interception on a diving catch and
Moresco got his second steal of the
game on a pass which glanced off
the hands of Farmer. This time it
was a 45 yard boot by Ruoff that
just cleared the crossbar, which
may have been a little lower than
the standard ten feet, tightening
the score at 14-13.

But the Panthers drove down the

ﬁeld again covering the 62 yards in _

ten plays. Once again it was the
Daniels to Corbett combination that
moved the"‘Cats in close as. they
connected for two 192;. yards passes.
Freshman Elliott Walker who
replaced Dorsett midway through
the third quarter ﬁnally went over
the top and Long hit again to make
the score 21-13.

his initial extra point try hit the
upright.

Pitt doubled the lead in the second
period when Taylor took a 17-yard
scoring pass from Cavanaugh with
5:19 to go and Sindewald raced 42‘
yards for a touchdown a minute
later. Wallace booted the extra
points and the Cubs led 28-0 at the
half. -

The third quarter, with Paez
calling the signals, proved to be the
most productive for the Panthers.
With 10:09 left, defensive back
John Sirb grabbed a Cougar aerial
and scampered 30 yards unmoles- _
ted ‘for a touchdown. Wallace 
added the extra point.

Pitt stretched their margin to 41-0
when Padovese made a spectacular
one-handed grab of a Paez bomb
goodfor 41 yards and a touchdown
at the 6:48 mark. Wallace's
conversion attempt was blocked.

Allegheny averted the shutout
three and a half minutes later as
Onishco found tight end Randy
Fraas free in the end zone for a
20-yard scoring toss. Dom Puppa's
kick was the Cougars’ only other

tally.

Before the third, period was over

the Panthers struck still another _
time. Two- plays following Di- 
Ciccio’s theft at the Cougar 11-yard
line, Paez faked a hand-off and
then sprinted eight yards to his
right to add to the rout. Wallac_e’s
kick made the score 48-7.

Looking Forward To Spring Drills

BY JAN MATTHEWS
It's myth exploding time.
Not all quarterbacks are ego

maniacs. Case in point is one Matt
Cavanaugh, freshman quarterback
from Youngstown, Ohio. ~

A two year starter in high school,
Cavanaugh has taken over the reins
of Pitt‘sjunior varsity football team
and has led them to three straight
victories.

Quarterback coach George Haff-
ner says Cavanaugh has the equip-
ment to become a major college
field general. A

“He has an excellent arm, one of
the better arms I’ve seen come out
of high\school, he’s "tall, strong,
and has been improving all the
time.”

Tim Padovese, a target of Cavan-
augh’s, praised the freshman.

“He's a helluva quarterback. A
great competitor.”

Speaking of competition, Cavan-
augh has his work cut out for him

mates, Cavanaugh surveyed his
chances for 1975.

“Well, two quarterbacks are
graduating, and that's good for me,
but I couldn’t say. I guess we'll
have to wait ‘til then."

As with any young quarterback,
Cavanaugh is learning, and has
more to learn.

“We would like to see him
quicker. and run a little better,"
said Haffner.

With two quarterback coaches--

» the other being ex-Steeler Bob

Leahy--Cavanaugh has shown pro-
gress.

“They have both helped, espec-
ially with reading defenses,” Cav-
anaugh said.

Before Haffner and Leahy could

Cavanaugh admitted he was re- 
cruited by “only" Ohio State and" ;_i.:
Penn State among others. _ '

“They were never really in the »
running. It came down to North .- _'
Carolina State and Pitt. Matey  I
didn’t put any pressure on me. ‘He
just told me the good and bad, and
I liked the program.” ' _

Cavanaugh. obviously embar-
rassed, admitted that he would like
a shot at the pros. Somehow he  .
doesn't fit the mode of a profes-I
sional quarterback. He is not 5 
brash, cocky, loud-mouthed. "or,
short tempered. Therefore. he
does not have the “tools" to be a
professional.

The mentor does not rule out the
freshman signal caller, however.
“He’s definitely in our plans.
He’s getting quite a bit of exper-
ience on the junior varsity team,
and he works out against our
defense.”

PITTSBURGH AP--Pittsburgh's
gdefense allowed only three drives
beyond the 50-yard line and Mel
Blount dealt the coup de grace with
a.-152-yard interception return for a

the Philadelphia Eagles 27-0 Sun-
day in a National Football League
game.

‘Philadelphia managed just 142 net
offensive yards, and Eagle quar-
terback Roman Gabriel had com-
pleted only five of 17 passes for 29
yards when he was lifted late in the
third quarter.

Gabriel. who went into the game
with more completions than any
;. NFL quarterback this season, was

the Steeler cornerback who was
convoyed down the sideline for a
touchdown that gave Pittsburgh a
27-0 lead. It was the fifth win in a
row for the Steelers, 6-1-1.
Philadelphia fell to 4-4 with its
third straight and most lopsided
loss this season.

Pittsburgh took a 17-0 halftime
lead against an Eagle defense that
had allowed the fewest points, 12.3
per game, in the NFL. ‘

Terry Bradshaw made his second
start of the season at quarterback
for Pittsburgh, completing 12 of 22
passes for 146 yards. He also
rushed four times for 48 yards.

Pittsburgh drove 65 yards 'on its
first series. It came on Bradshaw's
eight-yard pass to Frank Lewis.
The score was set up by a 35-yard
toss from Bradshaw to tight end
Larry Brown.

In the third quarter, safety Glenn
Edwards intercepted 21 Gabriel pass
and returned it 26 yards to the
Eagles‘ nine yard line, setting up a
28-yard field goal by Gerela after a
holding penalty had nulliﬁed a
touchdown sneak by Bradshaw.
Blount's interception touchdown
came on the next series.

The Eagles made their second
penetration into Steeler territory in

the final minutes of the Iourth
quarter when Tom Sullivan ran five
yards to the Pittsburgh 46 after a
29-yard pass completion from
Reeves to Harold Carmichael. The
Eagles drove to the Pittsburgh 31
before Reeves was sacked on fourth
down and 18.

In the waning seconds Reeves
scrambled eight yards to the Pitts-
burgh 48-yard line before the game
ended with an incomplete pass.
