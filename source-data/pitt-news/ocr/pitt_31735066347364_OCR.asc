Pitt Enrollment Drop Seen

BY CRIS HALL and
MATTHEW KENNEDY

High-level University adminis-A
trators are taking stock of Pitt’s
next 15 years and ﬁnding little
comfort in their predictions.

Pitt’s top forecasters predict the
University will see its full-time
undergraduate day enrollment at
to
pre-1970 levels by 1990- should
current trends continue, with
resultant cutbacks affecting every

Dina Natali

department on campus, according
to a conﬁdential Ofﬁce of Planning
and Budget document obtained by
the Pitt News.

This drop in enrollment would
translate into a 25 percent decline
in tuition revenue and this could
result in departments or schools
being “phased out, merged with
another, or signiﬁcantly reduced”
if the University does not under-
take successful intervening action,
according to the report, “The
University of Pittsburgh, 1976-
1990,”

Resigns

GreekAdvisor Post

BY DEANNA LOUISE

Greek advisor Dina Natali is
resigning her position effective
January 3, 1977 to assume a
marketing job with the Los
Angelés-based ‘division of Merle
Norman Cosmetics.

She announced resignation be-
fore a body of fraternity represen-
tatives at the Interfraternity Coun-
cil (IFC) elections Tuesday.

“I hate leaving the students, but
I couldn't resist the offer,” Natali

u said. Dan Liefield, Na_tali’s
graduate assistant, will assume the
duties of Greek advisor in the
Ofﬁce of Student Activities until a
new advisor is appointed. »

This appointment is‘ pending the
outcome of a Student Affairs
screening committee’ search for a»
Director of Student Activities to ﬁll
the position vacated by Nancy
Evans in early September.

Natali said her experience at the
national level of Delta Delta Delta
sorority eased her duties at Pitt.

“Any new Greek ad-visor should
have that kind of experience,
because it gives you an overview of
the Greek organizational set-up

from the campus to national level, ”
Natali said.

Natali conﬁrmed reports of an
increased interest in fraternities
and sororities on the nation’s
campuses. She said an increase in
pledges and initiates at Pitt during
the past three years is evidence of
this trend.

“There has been a renewed
enthusiasm in Greek life at Pitt this
year,” Natali said. 5 “This is the
ﬁrst year in many that more than
two people have run for IFC
President.

“That’s why we had a discrep-
ancy over what constituted a
majority at the IFC elections
Tuesday night,” Natali‘ said.
“When only two people ran for the
ofﬁce, one person had to have a
majority.”

After obtaining a bachelor’s
degree in languages and art at Pitt,
Natali worked as Dean of Women
at Slippery Rock College and later
went into marketing and research
at Kaufman’s in Pittsburgh, where
she gained the expertise required
for her upcoming position with
Merle Norman Cosmetics.

The report assumes income from
federal grants, state support and
private sources» to be stable, in
constant 1975 dollars, during the
1975-1990 period, but the loss of
tuition revenue will cause total
University revenue to fall to $145

.million in 1990 after reaching ‘a

peak of almost $170 million in 1980.
; This, paired with, a Federal
Bureau of Labor Statistics predic-
tion that college graduates will
exceed demand by 800,000 in the
next decade, could spell hard times
for the University and its students
in the future. A .

The 24-page report, circulated to
deans and heads of academic units,
asks ‘administrative heads to
respond with proposals on how
they might deal with the prospect
of fewer students and less money.

Replies from academic units
were due Nov. 15, and are being
reviewed at the Provost and vice
chancellor for health professions
level prior to review by the Office of
Planning and.:Budg,et. -A document

Rhoten Smith and Vice Chancellor
for Health Professions Nathan
Stark, would then be the basis for

Student Government Pro-

by the Student Government Board
(SGB) at Wednesday’s meeting.
The revisions include plans for a
steering committee to direct
Programming’s activities, and a

group of subcommittees that would
be responsible for the committee’s
functional work, such as choosing
talent.

The steering committee will be
comprised of one representative
from each of ﬁve groups; Resident
Student Association, Greeks, Black
Action Society, as well as one
commuter and one woman to be
appointed by SGB in the absence of
any recognized organization of
commuters or women.

“Basically we’re trying to make
the Programming Committee more
constitutional, ” SGB member Larry
Krain said. “The present
Committee has no structure.”

“The revisions will‘ make the

Each sub-committee will appoint
its own chairman, Krain said. The
chairmen will be a non-voting,
ex-oﬁcio member of the steering
committee.

“The sub-committees will still
have a voice but the Programming
Committee, itself, will be respon-
sible for ﬁnalizing the budget,"
SGB member Benita Marcus said.

The Board also approved full
recognition for a member of student
groups including the Collective for

Rosenberg Responds ToPIan

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY

“Let’sgkeep our heads,” was
the thrust of a conﬁdential reply by
Faculty of Arts and Sciences (FAS)
Dean Jerome Rosenberg to the grim
projections contained in a recent
ﬁfteen-year projection by the Pitt
Planning and Budget. _

The draft reply which has since
been amended by FAS Council, is
an official statement from Rosen-
berg on how FAS might adjust to
long-term drops in enrollment and
tuition revenue. FAS is the largest
academic unit in the University.
Using ﬁgures contained in the
long-range report, Rosenberg noted
enrollment in FAS‘ might drop from
the current 13, 478 to 8,928 by 11990.

The draft warns the University
adminstration must take care to
avoid generating a pessimistic
outlook among faculty on the future
of the institution and the defensive
tactics some departments might
employ as a result.

The letter also suggests that‘
long-term projects beyond ﬁve
years might»-V lead to “self-fulﬁlling
prophecies” if planning on es-
timates and predictions become too
rigid.

In citing several proposed
methods of reducing the impact of
tuition and enrollment drops
through the next ﬁfteen years, the

«FAS report listed several options:

—agressive student recruitment
based on high academic quality and
increased public relations efforts.

/—,extension of CAS programs to
qualiﬁed students over the age of
25. ,

——seeking ways of bringing Pitt’s
state allocation up to par with
Temple University’s, as Temple
already :has suffered drops in
enrollment while maintaining state
allocations higher than Pitt’s.

-setting a mandatory faculty
retirement age of 65, or offering
signiﬁcantrcash incentives to faculty
who might wish to retire at that age.

CORRECTION

On Wednesday the Pitt News
article entitled “Powers Wins IFC
Election” implied that Ezra Krieg
of Pi Lambda Phi contested the
election for IFC president when he
finished second in that race
Tuesday. In fact, Krieg questioned

IFC for the past several years when
the IFC executive board stumbled
upon an ambiguity in the guide-

ofﬁcerneeded a majority to win.
Unlike previous elections, this
year, more than two people were on
the ballot for external vice-presi-
dent and president, and the 51
percent majority rule that sufficed
in past elections no longer applied.

the election procedure followed by.

lines for election, which stated any '

The report goes on to note that _

the turnover in faculty positions in
FAS amounts to about eight percent
per year, and a freeze on
reappointments to employ slots
could be used to respond to drastic
situations, and that FAS tradition-
ally rigorous requirements for
tenure will prevent large numbers
of unfundable tenure committments
over the next 15 years.

If programs must be dropped,
the letter recommends units within
FAS be reviewed in terms of their
academic quality, beneﬁt to the
mission of the institution and cost
effectiveness, in that order of
priority.

On reallocation with FAS and the

University at large, the letter notes ’

that smaller professional schools
and some branch campuses might
not survive the coming enrollment
and revenues crunch‘, but adds that
the administration should refrain
from creating new academic or
administrative units" because of
their potential for expansion.

The report adds there is potential
for the addition of an undergraduate
business program as well as a
pre-clinical medicine program to
the FAS unit within the liberal arts

chancellors.

Ironically, this warning of future
trouble comes at the same time the
University is ﬁnding expected
enrollment ﬁgures for this year
were three percent too high,
resulting in aniimmediate, unex-
pected shortfall of $1 million to $1.5
million in income.

According to the “1976-1990"
document, undergraduate enroll-
ment at Pitt will peak in the very
near future, remain steady until
1980 and then drop sharply to a low
by 1990. I

Enrollments in other Pitt pro-
grams are expected to follow the
same general trend, with some
tarrying at higher levels before
beginning a slide that will leave
Pitt with 24 percent fewer students
than it had in peakgenrollment
periods.

Vice Chancellor for Planning and
Budget Jack Freeman stressed that
these figures are based on
extension of current trends, mak-
ing it a “worst-case” scenario that
does not consider any preventive
measures the University may
implement before 1980.

“The document is a think-
piece,” Freeman said. “The
projections there make no policy
decisions, but simply ask questions
about the next ﬁfteen years.

.. Planning is the most rational thing

in the world, and I think people are
beginning to understand that.”

According to Freeman, the
report was intended to “get people
thinking about what we’ve known
all along—fthe baby boom is over
and the number of students
available at college age will
decline."

Early reactions to the report have
varied from a cautious reply by the
FAS Councilto a Pitt ‘Professional
Union claim that the document
outlines the University’s first
gradual step into an age of
retrenchment’. ,

One assistant dean complained
that the document presented rigid
projections and ﬁgures that were
non-debatable, forcing responses
tailored to the Planning and Budget
ﬁgures.

Freeman indicated that no action
on administrators’ recommenda-
tions will come before the
off-campus senior staff meeting
and a substantial amount of
discussion at the appropriate
faculty and administrative levels.

As long as blacks accept the whites are not

everyone in that society is
“equal.” But let blacks demand
social justice, and they are guilty of
a superiority complex. So goes the
reasoning behind two letters in the
Dec. 6 and Dec. 8 Pitt News.
These letters attack the recent
demonstration at the Student
Government ofﬁce, and the de-
mands BAS raised. Howard E.

oppressed as are blacks—indeed, it
is white cops, white judges and
white jailors who do the oppress-
ing. The arguments in the two
letters are demagogic, irrational
and racist. Racist to the core. They
are not a call for genuine equality,
but a cover for the continued
oppression of blacks.

This is amply proven by the
absurd criticisms raised of the BAS
demands:

Jennikin’s Yuletid

BY MATTHEW ‘KENNEDY

Christmas is celebrated across

the globe in ways that would make a

good master’s thesis if anyone gave
it a thought. _

One of the more bizzare

Christmas parties was held early

this year at an especially dirty bar

on the outskirts of the campus, and
among the regulars there sharing
the good tidings was a certain Dr.
Samuel Q. J ennikins (Q for Quincy)
a member of long standing in the
department.

J ennikins, a ﬁrm believer that it
is better to give than receive in the
case of others, was ﬁrmly rooted at
his barstool, an oily looking draft of
Stroh’s before him. Needless to
say, the cheer of this time of year

has a depressing effect on his, agreed,

otherwise unsinkable sense of
outrage.

“Hey Jennikins,” the bartender
said, crunching a candy_cane with
relish, "‘what’re you going to get
the Trotskyist for christmas?"

J ennikins looked up, stunned.

“And since when do I have
responsiblity for this characters
Yuletide profit?” Jennikins
snapped.

‘ ‘Since last night, ’ ’ the bartender
replied evenly. “We drew names
outta the mailman’s hat and you got
the Trot. I picked Dean Goozarno

«and Lolita got Hizzoner Shapp. The
Trot got you.”

“Me, eh? I can see it now.
Lenin's baby shoes. Bronzed and
gift-wrapped.” Jennikins took a
scornful snort of his beer.

The bartender, not an easy man
to dismay, twisted his ﬁlthy rag in
an equally filthy glass, making an
impatient squeak.

“Come on Doc, it's Christmas.”

“Oh I know what you're after,
Eric,” Jennikins said, “soon you'll
bring up a certain fictional character

domination of ﬁve million white
settlers over the twenty million
non-white inhabitants. Where is
their concern for “equality" in
South Africa?

2) The letters reject the BAS
demand for an end to campus
police harassment of black stu-
dents. Writers of both letters see
nothing wrong with the fact that
70 percent of those arrested at Pitt
are black, yet blacks comprise only
six percent of the student popula-
tion. They must believe that blacks
have a natural tendency to commit

named Scrooge, and in a fit of guilt,
not to mention fear of the
supernatural, I'll go out and select a
nice gift for that ideological fossil
and presto...I'll discover the true

measure of Christmas, which is the .

love of your fellow man, no matter
how silly he might be.”

The bartender hurrumped and

stared pointedly at the barroom‘

wall, noticing to his dismay a large,
dangerous—looking crack in the
supporting wall.

“Well, don’t expect anything.
I'm just alittle too sophisticated for
that" f°ld°1'°1- You want me glowing
with good cheer? Send me away to a
re-education camp for realists.”

“I'll bet you don’t have a dreg of
cheer in you, Jennikins.”

“I watch what I eat,” Jennikins

The professor noisily ﬁnished his
beer, and glumly went outside to
ford the dirty streets where passing
busses methodically ground the
falling snow into what Jennikins’s
thought was a very appropriate
brown slush.

As he tramped his tall, lean form
through the bundled hordes crowd-
ed in from of store windows,
Jennikins happened to pass Goet-
ing’s Goods Store. That's when he
spotted the Trotskyist, at a cufflink
counter of all things, waving away
this and that to the distress of the
salesman, a $20 bill clutched in his
socialist hands.

Dumbfounded, Jennikins stood
in the stark center of the sidewalk,
bumped this way and that by the
grim shoppers who, headed down
and shoulders squared, marched
from store to store, seized by fits of
generosity, cumsumerism and,
well...good cheer.

J ennikins watched the Trotskyist
select a pair of cufflinks, hand ovef

‘the twenty and receive" six dollars

and change back. The cufﬂinks

ls ”E'qualit3/’Oppression Acceptance?

ted.0r not. Being black in a racist
society is a crime.

3) Finally, the authors of the
letter are blind to the fact that
blacks are the hardest hit by tuition
hikes and cutbacks in ﬁnancial aid
and enrollment. Measures de-
signed to overcome ,years of
discrimination are deemed unfair
to “other races." By “other
races” they mean the white race.
Again, their arguments for “equal-
ity” are just an apology for
institutionalized racism.

The BAS demonstration puts the

were gift-wrapped and placed on
the counter in front of him.
Jennikins felt a small, embarras-
sing lump creep up his throat. The
professor swallowed, took a deep
breath, and resumed his pushing
and shoving on the sidewalk. He
was probably late for class.

THE PARTY ‘

The denizins of the bar drank
without care in hopes that oblivion
soon would be their’s. When from
the front of the bar there rose such
curse, that the bartender thought
'twas the Vice Squad, or worse.

But what to their bespotted eyes
sohould appear, but Jennikins and
package—in full Yuletide gear!

He shook his thin hair and with a
growl the man said, p“Some joyful
old bastard nearly knocked me quite
dead.” And brushing the snow
from his pants and his coat, he
extended his gift with a grunt in his
throat.

“Merry Christmas, you freak,”
he croaked like a frog, “and Merry
New Year, too, you goddam
ideolouge. ” The Trotskyite opened
the package so dear, and inside
found glasses with two rear-view
mirrors.

So with a tear in his eye he gave
his present to Doc, a billyclub the
better with which the students to
knock. Aghast at no cufﬂinks,
Jennikins frowned, in a state of
shock, not making a sound.

“Well thanks for the gift, you
miserable jerk, I should try it on you
to see if it works. But I won’t, cause
it's Christmas so I wish you good

'luck. Just remember, you owe me,
jerk, close to ten bucks."

he spun on his heels and went for
the door, paused at the threshold
and let out a loud roar, “Joy to you,
commie, and the bar all around. I'll
be back when this cheerfulness
settles down to the ground.”

“Ya see,” Eric said, “The Doc
ain't such a lout. " And they toasted
his memory ’till they all had passed
out.

Is Not Worth $ l0

Finding a parking place in
Oakland has always been a
formidable task. Bus strike or no
bus strike, morning or night,
weekday or weekend, winter or
summer, there are just too many
cars vieing for too few spaces. But
the people who rely on Oakland for
education, business, ‘shopping,
entertainment and medical treat-
ment deal with the situation
remarkably well. It takes many
people as much time to find a place
to park as it does for them to get to
Oakland from their starting point.
That is a sorry situation when one
considers how bad traffic jams can
be on all roads leading into the
City.

But what irks me the most is the
meter maids. No one is really sure
if they can legally issue parking
tickets, but they still do. I even saw
two of these quasi-leal enforcers of
the law riding around in a private
car, presumably owned by one of
them, searching relentlessly for
cars whose time had expired. It
makes sense. I’d ' rather ride
around in a warm car than walk
down the cold wet streets and you
can cover much more territory by
car than you can on foot. Who
cares if, this is legal or not?

Twice this term I arrived at my

expired parking meter at the same
time as a meter maid did. I would
immediately put money in the
meter and even though the meter
maids were just starting to write
the tickets, they would not stop.
They gave the’ tickets to me instead
of putting them on my car’s
windshield. When I told one of
them that I didn’t think that what
she did was fair, she told me where
I could go and where I shold put the
ticket by using a wide variety of
four-letter words. Paying $10 to
hear some middle-aged lady a chip
on her shoulders swear at me
doesn’t seem like a bargain.
Even though parking spaces in
Oakland are scarce, meter maids
aren’t. Just let your meter run out
for even a couple of minutes and
you’ll be well aware of how many
meter maids must patrol the
Oakland area. A trip to traffic court
will verify this. It seems that well
over half of the people down there
received their tickets in the
Oakland area. It just doesn’t seem
fair. It’s adding insult to injury. I
hope that someday the City
planners will become aware of this
situation and maybe by some
miracle do something to rectify it.

Meeting For

administration agree to a collective
bargaining election. If elected, the
UGE would serve as bargainig
agent for graduate employes and if
defeated, the UGE would refrain
from campaigning for one year,
paralleling state regulations on
labor activities within Common-
wealth agencies.

Posvar replied in a letter that he
would meet with UGE if it was
arranged through GPSA. Although
GPSA agreed to do so, the
members stressed that their action
should not be taken as an
endorsement of UGE. “It doesn’t
imply an endorsement of collective
bargaining,” Bob Nelson, UGE
representative, said. “We are
asking Posvar to meet with us. The
issue is whether we shall have an
election or not."

In other action, GPSA discussed
the proposed budget for 1976/77 -
77/78.

GPSA, which currently gives
seven percent of its total activities
fee revenue to the Pitt News
approved a proposal to hold Pitt

BY PATTY TASCARELLA

_ B’nai B’rith Hillel -J ewish Univer-
sity Center is again sponsoring
Jewish free school during the winter
term. Several courses will remain
from the fallcurriculum, but Rabbi

' Joseph Levine says new courses
also will be added.

Levine started the free school last
November to ﬁll the gaps in
students’ knowledge of judaism.

“It’s an informal educational
program which is geared toward
individual student needs and
interests,” Levine said. “What’s

free about it, besides the fact that it ‘C

doesn’t cost anything except for the
Hebrew classes, is that people are
free to express their own opinions. ’ ’

Returning in J anuary. is the
Israeli Dance workshop, a Talmud
class led by Rabbi Bernard Poupko,
and Levine’s Jewish topics discus-
sion group.

~“I sort of took the initiative,”
Levine recalled of the past
discussion sessions. “It was a
combination of some of my ideas
and some from the group. ” He said
that students requested discussions
on mysticism, intermarriage and
the holocaust. These topics will be
discussed again next term with
specialists from different denom-
inations discussing the intermar-
riage of faiths issue.

the Hebrew conversational cour-

J ses are offered on several different

levels in cooperation with the
,Jewish Community Center of
Pittsburgh. While there is tuition

__involved, Hillel will split the fee

with the student. Levine said that if
the money is a factor, the student
should meet with him so an
arrangement can be worked out.

The newest addition to the
curriculum is the workshop in
Jewish arts and crafts.

“It’s - very individualized,” Le-
vine said. “‘Student‘s can do
anything they want.”

He said the focus would be on

making ritual objects such as’

“prayer shawls if they’re interested
in textiles”, but the range will be
wide.

“Even if there’s a student who
wants to read a short story by a
modern Israeli author, he can have
individual time with me to discuss
it,” Levine said.

Students can also make a
personalized Jewish catalogue
which will teach them about
women’s consciousness in terms

‘pf traditional Judaism.

Jewish Free School Resumes

Levine is also scheduling semin-
ars, “one-shot program,” on a
variety of topics, starting with the
January 16 seminar on Zionism
bringing together faculty and other
experts to discuss Israel.

In January, a listing of the
courses will be at Hillel and
students are to sign up for the
classes and times that interest
them. If a course someone is
strongly interested in is not offered,
the student is urged to take
suggestions to Levine.

Even though a student signs up
for a course, it does not commit him
to attend every session or for the
entire term. Likewise, anyone can

r drop in on sessions any time during
the term, except for the Hebrew
, classes.

“You can come and go as you
like,” Levine said.

It’s free school and the emphasis
is on individual freedom. T

 Poets ‘Le Magnifique'

BY KARAN REKASIE

This Wednesday’s International
Poetry_, Forum, “Two French
Canadian Poets,” was anything but
typical of forums. Director Samuel
Hazo introduced the poets, Paul-
Marie Lapointe and Gaston Miron,
and their interpreter, Douglas
Jones. After saying, in flawless
French, “Nous avons cette soiree
de la poesie canadienne,” Hazo
admitted, “l’ve had some coaching
for that.” I
Hazo thanked the individuals
responsible for the special IPF
award to Lapointe, in connection
with the University Press publica-

- PAUL LAPOINT E

tion of his book, Terror of the
Snows. the English translation
done by Douglas Jones.

Next, Hazo pointed to the grand ‘
- _ piano in the corner, while speaking

of Miron‘. “His friends call him,
‘Caston, le magniﬁque’,” Hazo

said. “He’s not only a poet but a_

presence...(pause)...like De
Gaulle, a very ﬁne singer and
musician. Perhaps we’ll see more
of his talentsgthis evening.”

Buchanan’s fame began at the
Crossroads, a small club in
Maryland. In 1970, the Rolling
Stones approached him to replace
Brian Jones. Buchanan refused,
suggesting that his image would
conﬂict with that of the Stones.‘

A major turning point occurred
for Buchanan when a young
journalism-advertising student,
Jay Reich Jr., saw Buchanan at the
Crossroads and later became his
manager in January, 1970. It was
with Reich’s guidance that Buch-
anan put on his first concert, to a

‘standing-room-only crowd, at the
Syria Mosque.

After that concert, and ﬁve

albums later, Roy has been praised

Miron, the founder of -the
Hexagone Press, the purpose of-
which is to create the modern
vision of French Candian poetry,
made a bemused, impish face and
wagged his ﬁnger behind Hazo’s
back.

Lapointe and Jones took their
places at identical lecturnes, side
by side. They looked like guant,
gray willows——elegant, poetic, sen-
sitive souls looming over the
lecturnes. ,

“I feel a little like Charley
McCarthy,” Jones smiled, amused
at his reference to the puppeteer.
He explained that Lapointe’s
poetry is written in a “surrealistic
vein” and apologized for the
exclusion of “Trees,” an extraor-
dinarily expressive poem” which
had to be omitted due to itslength.

The» first_ poem, “We have
taken our places under the"
thunder/Nous nous sommes in-
stalles sous le tonnerre,” crashed
with pain, but also with the strength
of resistance.

Another poem, as Jones,explain-
ed, was inspired by an;Eg'yptian

“But the people don’t seem to

.,.lntoP Pittsburgh Classic

BY MARIA SCIULLO

Not to be confused with the Roundball and Pennsylvania Classics,
the Pittsburgh Basketball Classic emerges this year as a spruced-up
version of the old Steel Bowl. Lack of student and community support
convinced the Post-Gazette Dapper Dan committee to not only change
the name of their tournament, but the format as well. '

Co-sponsored by the Greater Pittsburgh Chamber of Commerce and”
the Dapper-Dan Club, this year’s Civic Arena doubleheader showcases
the Panthers, Duquesne, Southern Illinois and Hofstra. The Dukes will

jgiﬁattle Hofstra at 7 p.m., tonight followed by the Pitt-SIU clash at 9.

jNinners will meet for the meet for the championship tomorrow
evening while the losers play for the consolation title in the preliminary
game. ,

Serving as ch airman and honorary chairman are former Pirate general
manager Joe L. Brown and Mayor Pete Flaherty. Many local
corporation and business groups have pledged their support in making ‘
the ﬁrst Pittsburgh Classic a.success.

The goal of the Classic committee is to make this event one of the most
competitive and prestigious collegiate basketball tournaments in the
country. Receptions for the visiting teams are planned, as are other
various social engagements. '

Student support, however, has been one of the biggest puzzles

ifoncerning Pittsburgh basketball in recent years. Panthers, for
example, just can't seem to bring their fans with them if it means
travelling outside of Fitzgerald Field House. There are many possible
reasons for this, ranging from lack of transportation to simply not
‘mowing how to obtain ticket to the Civic Arena games.

Last year, barely 300 Pitt student tickets were bought for. the Steel
Bowl, as compared to almost 1000 Duquesne student tickets. True,
basketball is not incompetition with football for attention at Pitt, but it '
seems difficult for Pitt to feel any type of home-court ‘advantage while .
surrounded by a predomin -  Duquesne crowd.

The rivalry between the I s and the Panthers is certainly strong
enough, as last year’s em: led contest proved. Pitﬂiwithout tho§“--

evening, both local teavis lost: Pitt bowing to Syracuse and the
University of Nevada, Las Vegas, trouncing the Dukes.

Twenty-five years of Steel Bowl action have seen Pitt accumulate a
IQ-21 record, while winning the championship seven times. Duquesne
is 35-13, a dozen-time winner in the finals. In the past, tournament
attendance wasn't always a problem. In 1970, national champion UCLA
beat the Panthers in front of a then-record crowd of 13,535.

Every year since 1961 (with the exception of 1972), an MVP has been

. named for his outstanding performance. For the past three seasons, this
ward has gone to a Pitt player: Billy Knight in 1973, Mel Bennett in
1974 and last year, Larry Harris.

John Cinicola’s Duquesne Dukes

are 2-1 in the early going this year,
having downed Wheeling easily and
Canisius narrowly before being
beaten (physically as well as on the
scoreboard) at West Virginia
Tuesday night in their East Indies
opener, 97-82. The Dukes are again
led by lightning-quick Norm Nixon,
6-2 senior guard, who is slightly
hampered by a broken finger on his
left (non-shooting) hand. Joining
Nixon in the backcourt will be 6-3

front the Dukes line up with 6-7 Rich
Cotten, 6-6 John Thomas and 6-8
Don Gambridge, with 6-8 Jesse
Hubbvard and 6-5 John Moore in
reserve. The Dukes are quick and
like to run, but as a result their
game sometimes deteriorates into
“street ball.” Cinicola’s freshmen
will see a lot of action, as injuries
have hampered the Dukes in the
early season.

Larry Harris, the MVP of last
year’s tournament, leads the
Panthers into the Arena averaging
22 points and nearly 7 rebounds per
contest. Other likely starters
include ‘6-8 Mike Rice (9 points, 7
rebounds), and 6-11 Eddie Scheur-
mann up front, with 6-0 Pete

Strickland running the show at point ‘

guard and 6-2 Sonny Lewis and 6-2
Wayne Williams seeing a lot of
action.

The Panthers are currently 1-2,
losers to Ohio U., 72-62, and
Virginia, 62-61, in a thriller. They
opened with a 79-77 victory over
West Virginia Wesleyan. The
Panthers need to develop more
consistency at both ends of the
court, as both offensive and
defensive lapses have hurt them
thus far.

Playing The Numbers

BY STEVE SYBERT
Sports Editor

Statistics and contraceptives are
very much alike—both come in
handy, but are they safe?

That is, can the Pitt Panthers,
whose . statistics look so much
better than those of their Sugar
Bowl opponent, the Georgia

I Bulldogs, prove on the ﬁeld their 

mastery on paper?

Let's make a comparison be-
tween the opponents pitted in the
1977 Sugar Bowl Classic in New
Orleans.

Pitt is 11-0 and ranked number
one by both wire service polls. The
Pa.nthei*sii'-racked up 354 points on
offen‘s'e,- while allowing a mere 130.

A In five of itsgames, Pitt gave up one

touchdown or less and faced two
teams that will also perform in a
bowl game—Notre Dave and Penn
State, the match-up in the Gator
Bowl.

Georgia, on the other hand, is
10-1, its only defeat coming against
Ole Miss (21-17), and ranked fourth
in the nation. The Junkyard Dogs
tallied 30 points less than Pitt, but
allowed a meager 118. They
whipped three strong teams that
will be in bowl games———Alabama
(Liberty), Kentucky (Peach) and
Florida (Sun). ‘

“There’s no doubt in my mind
that they are a" vastly improved
team from what they were last

year," Pitt Head Coach Johnny .
Majors said. Georgia finished with '

a 9-2 regular season mark last year,
before losing to Arkansas, 3 1-10, in -

the 1976 Cotton Bowl, despite
holding a 10-0 halftime lead. The
Panthers, who have displayed one
of the most astounding resurgences
in college football, ended up 7-4,
then clobbered Kansas, 33-19, in
the Sun Bowl.

Though the Panthers have
Heisman Trophy winner Tony
Dorsett (1,948 yards, 5.8 average),
the remainder of the Pitt runners
may be a step behind the Georgia
ground-gainers. Elliott Walker,
hobbled most of the season by
ankle injuries, ’ gained only 354
yards, while quarterback Matt
Cavanaugh, known more for his
passing, was the Panthers’ third-
leading rusher with 351 yards. The
Panther team rushed for .32
touchdowns, but Dorsett had”21]of
them. I

On the whole, the Georgia
running game could be more
balanced. Leading the way is
junior Kevin McLee, a Uniontown
native, whose 1,058 yards ranked
him-second in the Southeastern
Conference. This season, he
became only the second Bulldog
runner in history to rush for more
than 1,000 yards. Quarterback Ray
Goff, a senior, added 724 yards,
while classmate Al Pollard contri-
buted 680 yards——putting all three
of their top runners above Walker
and Cavanaugh.

Passing, however, is a different
story. Cavanaugh (854 yards and
eight TD's) and substitute Tom
Yewcic (218 yards) collected the
bulk of the Panthers’ 1,171 aerial
yards." Georgia collected 958 yards

as_ a team, with senior Matt
Robinson, who splits the playcall-
ing with Goff, tossing for 609
yards. Goff completed 62.1 percent
of his throws, but for only 322
yards. ‘

The 33 catches for Pitt tight end
Jim Corbett is high for both teams,
as is his 528 yards receiving.

The Panthers ‘also topped Geor-
gia as a team in interceptions,
24-17, (including Bob Jury’s nine,
high in the nation); punting
44.8-39.4 (thanks to Larry Swider);

and total offense, 4,369 - 4,033. Pitt »

gave up ten points all season long
in the second quarter, whilethe
Bulldogs’ most successful period
was the third, when they allowed
but six points.

Georgia's biggest edge may fall
in the return category, where it led
Pitt as a team, 399-364, in kickoff
returns and 250-104 in punt
returns. Bulldog safety Mark
Mitchell alone had 233 yards in
punt returns.

Linebacker Jim Cramer led the
Pitt squad with 129 tackles, while
defensive tackle Randy -Holloway
recorded an astounding 16 sacks.

GRID NOTES: - Ross Bronwer,
defensive end from Notre Dame,
captured the Outland Trophy
Wednesday as the outstanding
college football lineman in the
nation. Pitt's Al Romano, highly‘
touted for the award, was a
runnerup.

Dorsett was given his Heisman
Statue last evening in New York at
a banquet staged by the Downtown

Br JIM GEFSKY

lt was clearly a two-horse race
Saturday as the Pitt tankers and
Maryland outclassed their competi-
tion in the Penn State Swimming
and Diving. Relays at University
Park. But unfortunately for Pitt, the
Panthers were a bit outclassed as
well,°as Maryland finished with 358
points, Pitt with 312. A surprise
was the s_omewhat disappointing
performance of ‘ East Carolina,
(usually ‘a top power), which
ﬁnished towards the bottom.
lhe tankers won two events, took
six second places}; and two thirds,
and finished no lower than fourth,
which they did only twice. Pitt’s
victories came in the 2,000-yard

 

. 400- ard medle rela .

   

.£:'i:"-=’1&V‘»;'*V’I?‘ J" *  ~ .:«

 

lreestyle and the three-meter
diving.

in the 2,000-yard freestyle, the
Panthers finished with a time of
19:24./D, about ten seconds better
than the record. The victory was
due to the combined talents ofJerry
DeMuro, Dale Pflaumer, Tom
Dowd, and Bob Clemmer.

in the three-meter diving, Tom
1‘at.Y01 and Dave Reeder combined
for la-491.15, almost 35 points better
tliaii Maryland.

Pitt“s second place finishes were
in the 400-yard backstroke relay,
the 400-yard breaststroke relay, the
200-yard Medley Relay, the 400-
yard individual medley relay, the
200-yard freestyle ‘relay, and the

Outstanding play by '6-3 freshman center Wanda Rudolph—23 points,
21 rebounds, three steals, one assist and two blocked shots in the
championship game versus Penn State—helped Pitt win its own
Women’s Invitational Basketball Tournament last weekend.

\

ln the one-meter diving, an
unfortunate situation occurred but a
happy ending resulted neverthe-
less. Freshman Scott Winkler was
performing an inward 0ne-and-a-
half, when he hit the edge of the
board, thus sustaining facial
injuries. lt was feared he would be
unable to return, and thus the
one-meter diving team would be
eliminated. But to Winkler’ s credit,«.
he was not only able to return, but
he and teammate Jeff Schaffer
performed well enough to lift Pitt
from fifth place to a final
fourth-place finish.

Diving Coach Al Coffey thought
his divers had done their job. '‘I’m
very proud of all the divers,
especially Scott Winkler and Tom
Fatyol, who is doing the best diving
of his career," Coffey said.
“Although we’re not quite where
we’d like to be, by February we
expect to be there."

, it should be noted that Maryland
took its early-season event more
seriously than everyone else, as
witnessed by their shaving and
tapering before the meet. For this
reason, swimming Coach Dick
Bradshaw was not dismayed that
his squad failed to repeat last year’s
victory in the Relays.

o

"Although second place is no
fun, and Maryland will have a
psychological edge when we meet
again," he decided,» “I think this
was one of our best performances.
We were as good, if not better, than
we were last year when we wonithe
Relays, and we were strong in every
event. We weren't well rested and
we also didn't stack several of the
events. We also didn’t want to peak
this ' early in the season, as
Maryland apparently did. "

For the rest of December, the
tankers will truly have to live up to
the Avis slogan. They are
scheduled for practices most of the
month, and their level of condition-
ing may determine the outcome of
the rest of the season, which begins
with a home match against a strong
Bucknell team January 8.

Tripp Undefeated Icers

BY JIM PANE

The Pitt Hockey Club will strive to
preserve its undefeated Status
Sunday when the Philadelphia‘
Junior Flyers invade the Civic
Arena for a 1:30 p.m. game.
Junior Flyer Head Coach Paul

‘Grandomenico brings his 6-2

independent junior team record to
town in hopes of placing first notch
in Pitt's (2-0-1) loss column.
Asked to judge his upcoming
opponent's personnel, Panther
Head Coach Len Barcalow admit-
ted, “I don’t know much about

them. I do know they’re pretty
.good, but we’re pretty good,’ too.
When the referee drops the puck,
we’ll chase. after it just like they
.will.’’ *

Heading the chase for the Junior
Flyers will be leading goal-getter
Buster Tripp and co-captains Mike
Green andArtieJackson, the team’s
leading scorer.. Dean Richardson, a
high school senior, is the probable
starter in goal with Dennis Begley
backing him up.

Barcalow said he didn’t know and
wouldn’t know until game time,
whether Larry Newell, who hassa
5.00 goals-against average, or
Marty Bradley, who is hot off a
shutout victory over Cleveland
state, will mind the nets for Pitt.

He did promise, however, that
the best man would be in there and
he wouldn’t have to resort to
“pulling any short straws out a
broom.” ' ‘

Barcalow plans on using the same
basic lineup that has seen action

throughout the season. The only
new name on the Pitt roster will be
defenseman Don Deltondo, whis,
according to Barcalow, will pair
with senior Russ Stump on defense.
Pitt’s two “number—one lines,”
as Barcalow often describes them,
will again be in full force.
Sophomore Curt Hetz and seniors
Gary Fries and Jeff Saunders make
up “line number one,” while Larry
Sallick, Bill Gedeon, -and Tom
Sherwin, who’ve amassed 36 points

in three games between theft‘,

make up the other line number
It should be a good, close game,
even though the Junior Flyers
aren’t exactly fighting for a national '
championship. ’
’. “The object of the Philadelphia
Juniors Flyers is not to win the
national championship,” Junior
Flyer General \Manager John

,. Woolford said of his team’s main

purpose, "but to expose this area’s
coming to Pittsburgh——to _plt.y
schools like Pitt.”

PANTHER PUCKS: Immediate
ly following the Pitt-Junior Flyers
encounter, the Duquesne Dukes
will host GannonCollege to round
out a hockey double-header at the
Arena. ' ’ ~

The Panthers haven’t seen game
action.since thegll-0 thrashing of
Cleveland State November 20. The '
squad traveled to Kittaning last
Sunday for a‘ scheduled contest

against Indiana University'"<'>_f,"

Pennsylvania, but the game was
cancelled because of faulty rink
equipment at Belmont Arena.

“a“"DT'CCt't€'VC'$w'¢'t-T Ir

a 25-17 victory over the Maryland,
Terrapins last night at the
Fitzgerald ‘Field House.

Coach Dave Adams, who SWFC;

prior to the match that the early
bouts would be crucial, was more
than pleased with the wins by
Jackie Kline (2-2 record) at 126
pounds, and Ed Bredniak (3-2), at
142.

Two-time All-American Rande
Stottlemyer, sidelined with a rib
injury, was also quite happy with
the efforts of his youthful team-
mates, and was confident of a
match victory after Jim Gordon’s

win over Mel Hart, at 158, hrql,

brought the score to 13-9, still in
favor of the Terps.

“We were most confident of the
heaviest wrestlers doing well," are
said, “so when Gordon,’ s win came
after Kevin McNamara had been
pinned, things looked pretty
good.”

Stott1emyer’s analysis of the ‘

situation was excellent, as Pitt’s
Skip Bolin (5-0) overwhelmed Steve

Hogg. at 167 pounds, by a 1553
score, Bill Bailey (190) electrified‘

the crowd of nearly 1,000 by
pinning Brad Dunlap in 18 seconds,
and heavyweight Mark Stepano-
vich (4-1) less than half a minutafri
the second period to pin David
Snyder. Only a loss by the
Panthers’ Don Arndt, coming off a
shoulder injury, to outstanding
Steve Heger (4-0-1) at 177 pounds
kept the Panthers from sweeping
the last five bouts. Neither Adams
nor Stottlemyer was Slli;   at
Heger’s 15-4 win.

Adams was elem  '  v-.-'it‘si the
