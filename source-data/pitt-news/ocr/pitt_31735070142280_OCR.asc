Nout at restaurants, Elwin S
Cotman typically spends
about $10 per month on food. For
that same price, a donor can sponsor
a malnourished child through the
charity Feed the Children.
Cotman isn’t a child, however,

and he’s deﬁnitely not malnourished. _

Cotman is a 25-year- old African-
American with loud, ruddy 
and a quiet, monotone voice. His
grocery bill is light, because when
Cotman goes to the grocery store, he
usually passes the entrance and goes
around to the Dumpster, where he
salvages about 70 percent of his food.
Cotman isn’t unemployed — he

works as an adult literacy tu-

tor — but he ‘wants to disconnect
from what he calls the “capitalist .

himselfas a “freegan,” a member of a

Staff Report

City Council armounced today that
an organization of Pennsylvania mu-
nicipalities has voiced support for the
1 percent tuition tax proposed by the
mayor.

The Pennsylvania League of Cities .

and Municipalities, anonproﬁtassocia—
tion created to represent municipali-
ties in state and federal governments,
voiced its support for the initiative

today-

Councilman Rev. Ricky Burgess,
whose district includes East Liberty
and Homewood, saidthe supportofthe
leaguewillhelp showthelegitimacyof
the tuitiontax.

“I think that in the next couple of
days, there will be other things that
solidify the wisdom of this,” Burgess
said. /

Rick Schuettler, deputy executive
director of the Pennsylvania League of
Cities and Municipalities, said the orga-
nization has supported municipalities
ﬁnding ways to get revenue from tax-
exempt institutions for a long time.

“We support autonomy for local
governments and givingthem options
to ﬁnd what the best ﬁt is for them,”
Schuettler said.

Schuettier said he could not com-
ment on the accusations from some

city, state and university officials that T

the tax could be illegal

“We’re relyingonthe same opinion
that Pittsburgh has shared with us,”
he said. '

Schuettler said the league did not
weigh Mayor Luke Ravenstahl’s Fair
Share Tax against other proposalsfor
collecting revenue from tax-exempt
nonproﬁts and thatthey supportedthe
tax because it was one option munici-
palities could use to collect revenue.

He said the league agreed with the
mayor on students’ role in paying for
city services.

. “Municipalities don’t have the lux- A

uryofprovidingservices onaselective
basis,” Schuettler said. “Webelieve t:hat
everyonehasafairsharetopay. Munici-
palservices cost money.” ’
PittsburghandPhiladelphia, aswell
as smaller municipalities throughout

, the commonwealth, are represented

in Schuettier’s organization.

“We promote autonomy and assist
communities intrying to provide the
most effecﬁve local governments as
possible,” he said. '

City, colleges continue talks

Three local college presidents met
with the mayor to discuss the tax on
Monday, accordingto the Post-Gazette,
but Chancellor Mark Nordenbergwas
not present at the meeting.

Pitt spokesman John Fedele said
the chancellorwas travelingyesterday
and today. .

Joanna Doven, aspokeswomanfor

vitedto the meetingbecause she didn’t

enviromnent.” The group hosts chapters in 45
states. In Pittsburgh, Cotman and others from
Food Not Bombs would prepare and serve food
that they salvaged from South Side Dumpsters
to homeless people.

“I don’t believe in locking food up and forc— A
ing people to work in order to survive and get
the sustenance they need. I think it’s ridicu-
lous,” he said. ~ A

After Cotman opened the lid, we took turns

C jumping into the Dumpster and handing food

over the side. The Dumpster did not smell rank,
but there was a half—inch of egg yolk carpeting »
the ﬂoor. Cotman explained that stores tend to
throw out large quantities of just a few products
every day and that we were fortunate enough

to come on an egg day. We loaded about four
dozen eggs, 50 1unch—sized bags of sour cream
and onion chips, a plastic crate of grapes and
three tubs of pre—made pasta salad into Cot—
man’s trunk.

Iwas impressed with our haul, but Cotman
had seen better. In 2005, Cotman graduated
from Pitt with an English major and moved
to Washington, D.C., where he paid $250 per
month to live in a house called “The Fishing
Hole” with like-minded activists. Though
Cotman worked as an after-school middle
school teacher; he and  housemates would
Dumpster-dive every day. .

Making use of unwanted food

Cotman said. “[We] just had a kitchen full of
food to the point where we could feed the
homeless with it, to the point where we could
invite people into our home and just give them

‘ food.”

It might seem like a coincidence that Cot-
man has met others who eat out of the trash
and serve salvaged food to homeless people,
but his habits are becoming fairly common.
While there are no reliable surveys of the
number of freegans in the United States, their
notoriety in the national media has been esca-
lating: In the past two years, Business Week,
Anderson Cooper 360°, The Oprah Winfrey

P Show, Fox News Channel, Tucker Carlson and

Marie Claire have all put freegans on display,

I usually with a conclusion in which the host or

author tries the food and declares that it actu-
allytastes great. ’

After  six loaves of artisan bread
from a second store’s Dumpster, Cotman
and I drove back to his house. He lives in a

, Lawrenceville row house named “Cyberpunk

Apocalypse” that rents rooms to young writers
for $50 per month. The house is owned and

_ operated by another Pitt English department

graduate, Daniel McCloskey, 23, who bought
the house after receiving an unexpected
inheritance from a great—aunt whom he never
met. The food we salvaged was shared by the‘
seven housemates who perform house chores
and collect food according to a schedule on the
refrigerator.

We stood in the kitchen to ate some of the

_ food we gathered. I ate the chips, because they

were sealed in bags, and then summoned the

courage to try some of the bread Itwas obvious

why the bread was discarded: It fell apart in my

hand ’
As Cotman drove me home, we spoke

‘ about his ﬁxture. He is a serious, amateur

fantasy writer, who writes about “elves, fairies
and unicor_ns.” However, he knows that, in

the long-run, his lifestyle is as much afantasy

as his stories. When he gets older, he wants

to teach middle schoolers and raise afamily,

so he doesn’t expect to have enough time to
Dumpster—dive. Instead, he’s looking at ways

to be practical while remaining idealistic, like
mastering urban farming and living off the grid.

Editorial

Community colleges

could help economy

resident Barack Obama

said last week that he’d

like community colleges
to play an active role in creating
jobs. He wants to see U.S. com-
munity colleges produce ﬁve
million more graduates by the
year 2020. Likewise, Obama pro-
posed spending $12 billion over
10 years to aid colleges in im-
proving programs, courses and
facilities at two-year institutions,
according to The Chronicle of
Higher Education.

By shifting focus to two-year
schools that aim to provide the
knowledge and technical skills
that can most quickly lead to jobs,
this should provide the kick—start

we need to employ Americans ‘

and liven up the economy.
Earlier this fall, the Com-
munity College of Allegheny
County took a similar approach.
The college waived tuition for
220 laid—off workers to train in

high-demand ﬁelds like weld—‘

ing, accounting and emergency
medicine, in conjunction with
local employers.

While the bachelor’s degree
and the liberal education provide
a certain indicator of success in
society, such technical skills that
can quickly lead to a job are what
workers in need of jobs and our
economy require. _

Clearly, the president sees the
strength in this type of educa-
tion. U.S. technical schools pro-
vide the horsepower to create
commerce.

With an ailing economy and

Americans waiting for an occu— _

pation to continue their lives, ef-
ﬁcient and directive education
shines through as an appropriate
response.

Obama might not be focus-
ing on liberal arts degrees for
staunching unemployment, but
can the country afford such a
luxury at this time? Unemploy-
ment hovered around 10 percent
in November, a rate that fared
slightly better than October’s
rates but still isn’t exactly indica-
tive of economic well being. Also,
keep in mind that the national
unemployment rate was 4.9 per-
cent when the recession began in
December of2007.

The idea is to get people back
on their feet in as" fast and fea-
sible a way as possible — by
quickly and cheaply training
them for skilled labor jobs. In
this case, Obama has been keen
in his actions, and his grassroots
approach to this policy is remi-
niscent of the new way of govern-
ing he promised when running
last fall. He reminded us that
there is credibility in starting
policy at the community level,
a better course of action than
the idealistic approach, where
efforts toward a goal trickle to
the bottom.

Our country might not em-_

brace technical education as
our new liberal education, but
it will hopefully survive by it. A
decreased unemployment rate
will mean stronger buying power
of the consumer and more move-
ment of money.

This buying power is not lim-
ited to necessities, though. When

the United States as a whole has_

weathered past this economic

storm as the president sees, lib- '

eral arts-based education will be-
come an increasingly pragmatic
ﬁnancial option. But for now, we
need a quick ﬁx.

The Giles Files

Libraries must charge to survive

 
   

Giles Howard
Columnist

The Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh

- will raise ﬁnes on overdue materials

thisjanuary in an effort to offset its
budget deﬁcit. This latest develop-
ment in a months-long saga is just
one part of the institution’s attempt
to stay aﬂoat in the face of a $6 mil-

- lion budget deﬁcit.

Technically a nonproﬁt, the
Carnegie Library system receives
93 percent of its funding from the
government and is working closely
with the city to raise funds. City
Council allocated $600,000 to the
-Carnegie Library in order to keep
all of the nonproﬁt’s 19 branches
open next year and —— most im-
portantly for Pitt students — $1
million of the revenue from the pro-
posed Fair Share Tax is intended for
the libraries.
But the city’s solutions are noth-
ing more than ‘short-term ﬁxes and,
as long as they approach the solu-

tion through the typical nonproﬁt
box, it is unlikely that the city will
ever come up with a longterm
solution to the Library’s budget
deﬁcit. .
After all, the $600,000 was a
one-time payment that came from
the city’s fuel fund, and it appears
unlikely that the Fair Share Tax
will make it out of City Council
this session. Instead of clinging
to its nonproﬁt status and asking
the government to bail it out, the
library should continue on the

route of raising ﬁnes and charg-

ing those who use and overuse the
libraries.

Of -course, I’m not suggesting
that the library raise-ﬁnes as the
sole means of supporting itself, but
instead that it turn into a for-proﬁt

business that charges patrons for

a monthly or yearly membership.
As Gordon Gekko said in the movie
“Wall Street,” “What’s worth doing
is worth doing for money.”

Such a for-proﬁt library system 4

would also guarantee that people
who use the libraries —- myself in-

x

cluded —— would be the ones who
paid for_the libraries’ existence
rather than shifting that burden
to university students and city resi-
dents who aren’t cardholders in the
Carnegie Library system.

Acting to trim costs in Octo-
ber, the Carnegie Library’s board
of trustees moved in the right di-
rection by voting to close the ﬁve
branches of the system that receive
the least traﬁic and reducing hours
in the remaining branches. Elimi-
nating services in order to ensure

longterm solvency was the respon— _

sible thing to do, but hundreds of
individuals organized community
groups and turned out at public
meetings to oppose the service
cuts. _- ‘

Protesting the closure of their
libraries, these individuals and
community groups repeatedly
asked the city and city taxpayers
to step in and pay for the continu-
ation of their community library
while never offering to pay for it
themselves.

Of course, I understand their

reason that we should not ask oth-

Pittsburghers believe that they are not only entitled to

. largess, they would have greater
. control over the future and qual-

ity of their local ‘libraries. Instead,
these individuals are waiting for
the government to solve their prob-
lem. '

But it is the libraries’ involve-
ment with the government and its
status as a nonproﬁt that partially
explains its dire ﬁnancial situation
today. .
Because it is a nonproﬁt, the li-
brary’s board of trustees meets in
secret and is accountable neither
to its patrons nor to the taxpayers
that ﬁind it.

Because Andrew Carnegie paid ,

for the library’s construction and
the government paid for its opera-

nancially responsible for the li-
brary’s operation.

Admittedly, such a for—proﬁti

library would be a bold move, but
it would empower Pittsburghers
to voluntarilydecide where their
money goes instead of relying on
the government to take that money
_ by force and allocate it for “the pub-
lic good.” Bold as it is, I would sug-
gest that voluntary participation in
the free market historically pro-

duced greater public good than any

government spending ever did.

It might even be able, to cre-
ate a thriving and solvent library
system where the government was
only able to create a deﬁcit-ridden
mess.

Keith Gillogly
Opinions Editor

Take a look at my last name. Have
you seen it before? Probably not. As
much as it is unique, it’s also ‘quite a
conundrum when it comes to pro-
nunciation. '

Now, I don’t know the entire
lineage behind it. I know it’s Irish
— I’m a whopping one—eighth Irish.
Yet most people don’t ask about its
ethnic origin. They favor a more
basic question: How the hell do you
pronounce it?

Too often people with frequently
n1ispronounced last names gripe
about their situation. Yet I reﬁise to
succumb to this pessimistic outlook.

' Save the blossoming bachelorettes

out there, there’s no hope for a new
surname. So learn to live with it.
Better yet, appreciate it.

I consider people with impos-
sible-to-pronounce and very un-
usual last names, like me, the lucky
ones. While I’ve always wondered
what my life would be like if my
last name was Smith or Jones, I’m
glad it’s not. Perhaps it’s a strange,
guilty pleasure of mine, but I ﬁnd it
downright amusing to hear all the
different pronunciations. And I’ll be
candid, listening to hapless victims
struggle with the pronunciation is
most of the fun.

I’ve the chance for some enter-
tainment when I’m before someone

A new reading off my name. After see-

ing my name, the speaker’s brow
inevitably furrows. At this point I
should provide the correct elocution
in a cheery voice and reassure the
perplexed individual of my name’s
insurmountable difﬁculty. Nope.
Instead I adopt a resolute reti-

cence.-My expression beckons the
speaker: “C’mon. I dare you.” The
braver ones attempt a few syllables.
Usually, the speaker eventually gives _
up. “Err  how do you say your last
name?” ’

As much as I enjoy hearing the
array of pronunciations, there’s a
point between amusement and hor-
rendous butchery. Some instances
make me wish people would just
ask. One time a woman I recently
met introduced me to her cowork-

66-

It’s the reserved, sensitive
ones that surrender their
attempts out of sympathy.

ers as “Keith Jill-oo—jlee.”Jill-oo-

jlee? Sounds like the name a 2-year-

old would give to his favorite kind of
Jell-O. I struggled to keep that warm,

nice-to-meet-you smile on my face
after hearing this one. The woman
didn’t even hesitate or stutter --

what a killjoy. Yet her rash assump-

tion proved a cacophonous misstep.

In cases like this, the amusement-

factor becomes lost in the jarring
phonetic train wreck.

But believe it or not, there’s a
practical side to having a unique
and often-garbled last name. With
every new person, I'm allowed a
brief introspective glance, a more
insightful ﬁrst impression. Usual-
ly it’s the reserved, sensitive ones
that surrender their attempts out
of sympathy. They don’t want to of-
fend me with their gaffes.

Then there are the slightly bold-

er variety, the kind who like a chal-
lenge. Some give up halfway. Some
endure. All proceed with caution.
Most are wrong, but hey, thanks
for playing. I’d say this is the most
common group.

And then there are the ones
all too sure of themselves, even
headstrong. They blurt out what-
ever pronunciation ﬁrst pops into
mind without so much as atwinge of
doubt. Of course, they never bother
to ask if they got it right.

Not all of the pluses, are limited

to face-to-face interaction, how— -

ever. As anyone with an impossible-
to -pronounce last name knows, the
ability to screen telemarketers is an
incomparable beneﬁt.

“Hello. May I speak to a Mr. or
Mrs. (long pause) Gi - Gi ...” Click.
Never even gave the poor sucker a
chance.

And I love Googling myself even
though the results never turn up

anything interesting. If I had to sift‘

through a thousand other Keith
Gilloglys just to ﬁnd a webpage
with the real me, boy would I feel
cheated and frustrated. When those
with common names attempt this
semi-narcissistic act, they’re usu-
ally met with a harsh truth: Looks
like there are hundreds of others
with your name that all happen to
be much more ‘accomplished and
famous than you. If they weren’t,
maybe your Facebook page would
be a top hit. Lucky for me, I don’t
have to compare to the standard
of masses. .

Well, I suppose I should provide
the proper pronunciation. It’s  hey
wait, if I did that, I’d ruin all the fun.
But keep guessing. Maybe you’ll get
it right. Eventually.

Senior Staﬁ" Writer

Avant-gardepoetiycabarettroupe The
TypewriterGirls tackles the question
that should be weighing heavily on the
minds of Pit1sburgh’s literature lovers:
How can we save the libraries?

The TypewriterGirls’ solution: a
beneﬁt performance likeno other.

In a manner not unlike a poetry
readingonacid, the showthispastSun-
day night at Carnegie Library Lecture
Hall included performance art pieces
by Christiane D., a vocal performance
by songwriter Phat Man Dee, dance

‘ performancesbyNothingAgainstKan

Achieve Entertainment dance company
and, of course, presentationsfrom sev-
eralpoets includingNancy Krygowski,
Sandra Beasley and the Typewriter-
Girls co—founders Margaret Bashaar

and Crystal Hoﬂinan.

“People don’tthinkofpoet1yasbe—
ingas exciting or entertainingas other
art forms. Part of what we’re doing is
showingthatpoetrycandothosethings
and still have an artistically valuable
aspect to it,” Bashaar said.

“We have ahealthymixof different
artistic styles. It’s kind of like avariety
show that’s centered around a poetiy
readingand also incorporates comedy
sketches that I write,” Hoﬂinan said.

The sketches create a loose narra-
tive, and Bashaar described them as
having“amagicalqualitytoit.The story
gets told through the sketches, pulling
all of the performances together into a
bigwacky ridiculous storyline.”

The performance included a liter-

ary-bent library focus in accordance

with the event’s purpose.

“The library has always been very
supportive of poetry and what we’re
trying to do,” Hoffman said.

“Like everyone else, we heard that
libraries are not getting the ﬁmding
that they need. Five branches are be
ing consolidated or closed. We wanted
to do somethingto help, so Crystal ap-
proached the libraries to see if they’d
be interested in us doing a beneﬁt,”
Bashaar said.

Bashaar spent most of her child-

hood in the Mount Lebanon branch
of the Carnegie libraries.
I “There were always nice activities,
andlgotto read alot of things Iwould
have never encountered otherwise.
Now I have a 4-year-old son, and I’m
tryingto encourage the same desire to
read and be interested in literature in
himthatmymother encouragedinme.
I think libraries are a really important
aspect ofbeing able to do thatvvith our
children,” she said.

Asilent auction was held before i

the performance. Items auctioned off
included donations ﬁ'om local artists

andgiftcardstostarbucksandmassage

therapists. Many local poets and pub-

lishers donated books and chapbooks,

as well. All proﬁts generated from the

auction andticketsforthe performance
were applied to the Carnegie Library’s

general operating fund.

“We’re really big on getting the au-
dience involved actively in our perfor-
mances,” Bashaar said.

Each audience mernberwas invited
to compose a single line of poetiy on

— of course —- a typewriter before
the show began. The TypewriterGirls
then created apoem out ofthe lines and
performed it atthe show’s conclusion.
These collaborative poems are 
Exquisite Corpses, a name taken from
the ﬁrst line of one of the ﬁrst group-
effort poems of tire surrealist move-
ment: “The exquisite corpsedrinksthe
new wine.”

Hoffman saidthatthe presentation
of the piecemeal poem “depends on
how much time we have. Sometimes
we improvise it on stage. Sometimes
someone will work on it to make it
more ﬂuid as the show is going on or
to develop atheme.” . _

The'I‘ypewriterGirls coalesced into
a performing group when Hoffman
and Bashaar were students at Carlow
College.

“We were a bunch of friends who

V liked writing on typewriters and took

them everywhere. Peoplestartedcalling
us ‘those typewriter girls,’” Hoffman
said.

The'I‘ypewriterGirlsﬁrstperforrned
in 2006 at a beneﬁt for the Books for
Prisoners organization. ’

“We didn’t know it would kick off
as somethingwe’d do allthetime,butit

doing them on a regular basis,” Hoff-
man said.

Sayinggoodbye to a decade of chic comfort

Samantha Stahl
Columnist

As the decade comes to an end, I ﬁnd ‘

myself thinking about what will be
the characterizing trends of the ﬁrst
decade of the new millennium. The
’90s had grunge, the ’8os had harsh
blush and side ponytails, and the ’70s
had bell-bottorns.

Years from now, what will our de-
scendants wear when they have an
“Early Years of the Millennium” party?

W1llitbeleggings?Oversizedsunglass— I

es? Lady Gaga leotards‘? Crocs? Uggs?
Trucker hats? Heavy eyeliner?
Somehow, a whole mess of ugly
crept its way into fashion over the
last 10 years —- but there were also

. highnotes. The dreadful pleather and

general sartorial harshness ofthe’9os
segued into edgyfemininity. Therewas
aresurgence of prettiness. .
Sadly, the day of “Mad Men”-era
‘formality is long gone, but with its
loss comes a new kind of casual-cool.
People might not wear heels to do their
daily errands anymore, but if you’re
going to be comfortable, at least look

good doing it. And no, I don’t mean
by throwing on ajuicy Couture track-
suit. .
NewYork-based designer Alexan-
derWang revolutionized laidback—luxe
in20o7, with knitwearthat made just
about every fashion editor and assis-
tant salivate. He created pieces that

were meant to be worn fashionably _

every day, emphasizing that the way
you dressed down meant more than
the way you dressed up.

American Apparelwasfoundedin
1989 as awholesale T-shirt company,
but since the beginning of the millen-

nium it has re—focused its efforts on
retailand became the Starbucks of the
clothingbusiness. It started pumping
outa rainbow of cotton basics that let
fashion and function hold hands and
skip down the streets of Brooklyn.
Designer denim became a multi-
billion-dollar industry with a new
“it” brand debuting more frequently
than re—inventions of the Facebook

homepage. Finally, itwas OK to dress

up jeans.

If there’s one thing to be thankful
for about living in this past decade,
it’s that it is 1Q0 percent possible to

be comfortable as well as fashion-

forward. It is for this reason I am

constantly ﬂabbergasted by people’s

inability to put a marginal amount of
effort toward getting dressed. So I’m

signing off the semester with the fol-

lowing PSA:

I’rn going to make this short and
sweet since I know you have loads of
studyingto do. Forgive me for sound-
ing like a bit of a broken record here

since I’ve said this all before, but I feel

like I need to give a few reminders
about “The Rules” nowthat its gotten
chilly and sartorial apathy has started

A quick refresher course in looking pulled

erally do not look good. Especially when paired
withamatching sweatshirt and sneakers. Unless
you’re en route to aﬁnal in the Baierl Rec Center,
put on something else. —

I know you’re spending long hours in the li
brary and don’t evenwanttothinkaboutfashion,
but guess what! It’s just as easy and comfortable
toput on leggings andatunic andapair ofboots.
Really. I sweartoyou, it won’t even take two min—
utes longer than bundling up in sweats. Ifyou’re
cold, put on a scarf. Gloves, maybe too. If you’re
reallyfeelingballsy, tryahat. It’ll makeyouroutﬁt

Guys, don’tthinkyoucanslip away unscathed.
The sweatpants rule is applicable to you, too.
You’re already allowed to wear baggier jeans, so

If you want to wear a sweatshirt, ﬁne. But stash‘
the Pitt Panthers one and try a colored hoodie.
Major improvement, I promise you.

Even with the return of senior guard
Jermaine Dixon, the Pit men’s
basketball team’s offensive troubles
continued last night in its 74-64 loss
tolndiana. V
After scoring just 47 points in
awin against New Hampshire last
Friday, Pitt shot 32 percent from the
ﬁeld last night against the Hoosiers
(4-4). The Panthers ﬁnished the game
with just 11 assists and 15 tumovers.
Dixon, who missed the Panthers’
ﬁrst eight games with abroken foot,
came off the bench but didn’t score
any points. He went 0-of—2 from the
ﬁeld, with two rebounds, an assist, a
steal, ablock and three turnovers.

Harrison, Cole leads Pit

Panthers wirLf77-52 over Valparaiso

Jay Huerbin
Sports Editor

It was a special day for the No.
15 Pitt women’s basketball team
at the Petersen Events Center
last night.

Guard Taneisha Harrison,
who set a new personal best in
points, and forward Chelsea
Cole, whoﬁnished a career-
high in rebounds, led the
Panthers to a dominant 77-52
win over visiting Valparaiso.

Head coach Agnus Berenato
celebrated the win by blowing
out the candles on a cake. She
celebrates her birthday today.

Harrison led the way for
the Panthers (8-0), who didn’t
need much time to separate
themselves from the Crusaders
(3-4). Her 27 points broke her
previous career—high of 25, a

. feat she accomplished on Nov.

24 against St. Francis.

“I just felt like she was on
fire. It was just one of those
nights were she was in the
zone,”; Berenato said. “Let’s

. not just say a career night in

shooting. I think she got a lot
of that from other things, off of
her defense.”

Harrison said her mental
preparation helped her execute
on the court.

“I was just focused a lot
more. I missed a few shots

2 early, but I knew my team had

conﬁdence in me,” she said.
“It’s just being focused and
ready for a game and knowing ,
the coaches have confidence in
me.” _ ' ‘ ’
The Panthers and Crusaders
traded points early in the game

‘before starters Cole, Harrison,

Shawnice “Pepper” Wilson,
Jania Sims and Shayla Scott
overmatched Valparaiso’s
defense.

Roughly three and a half
minutes into the ﬁrst half, '

‘ Wilson took a pass from Cole
