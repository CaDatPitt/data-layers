Reagan Wins Election-

By WALTER R. MEARS
I AP Special Correspondent
WASHINGTON— Ronald
Reagan won the White House
Tuesday night,,sweeping past

‘President Carter to restore

Republican rule. Carter conced-
ed, saying the people had
spoken “and I accept that deci-
sion.”-

The polls were still open in
the West when » Carter
acknowledged that his presiden-
cy was finished—an hour after
telephoning Reagan in Los
Angeles to congratulate him on
victory.

So ended the longest cam-_

paign, in the makings of a land-

slide that belied the forecasts of
the president and the pollsters
that it would be close. It never
was, from the moment the first
polls closed.

With 29 percent of the na-
tion’s precincts counted,
Reagan was gaining 50 percent
of the vote, Carter 43 percent,
independent John B. Anderson
6 percent.

In _electoral votes, the com-
petition that counted, it was a
Reagan runaway. He had won
or led for 384 electoral votes, a
comfortable cushion past the I
270 he. needed. Carter had won
or led for 74.

Senate on Mervis Hall Moves

By COLLEEN McDONALD
Pitt News Staff Writer

Students are complaining about
the move of the registration and
student account offices to Mervis
Hall, according to Bernadette
Herwerd, Student Government
Board member at Monday’s univer-
sity Senate meeting. ‘ ‘

There has been a lack of publicity
concerning the relocation of four
service offices; The Registration
Office, Cashier and Student Ac-
counts Office, the Transcript Office
and the Office of Student Loans
and Special Accounts to the ground
floor of Mervis Hall on University
Place, Herwerd said. A

Many of the students find
themselves confused about the loca-

tion,‘ she 'said. There are signs
posted on G-33 and G—17 in the
Cathedral of Learning stating that
the move was made to Mervi_s Hall
but there is‘ no mention of the
whereabouts. of Mervis.

“I went up to Mervis today,”
Herwerd said, “there is no main en-
trance marked and the place was in
total disarray. There. were
workman and nails and tools laying

on the floor. It needsmore time to .

be completed.” '

Herwerd said the plan might have
looked good on paper, but the
strategic location is not the’ best.

Joseph Dutton, ,vice‘ chancellor
for Business and Finance said there
was no room for expansion in the

S‘ Langley Hall Lawsuits Settled;
Nearly $1 .5 Million Awarded

By JANE HOLAHAN
‘Pitt News Staff Writer
The various lawsuits filed against

‘ theEquitable Gas Company and

additional defendants including
Pitt, after the January 20, 1977, ex-
plosion at Langley Hall, have been
settled out of court. Approximately
$1.5 million has been ___awarded to

. the 17 different plaintiiis.

The settlement which was reach-
ted under Common Pleas Court
Judge» Joseph Del Sole does not
determine who was liable. for the ex-
plosion, only how much each plain-
tiff will be awarded.
Approximately $1 million will go

to the estates of the two women kill- '

ed in the blast, Patricia Hostetler,
20, a Pitt student and Carleen
Curry, 35, a Pitt secretary, and 13
other people injured in the explo-
sion. The rest will go to insurance
carriers for Pitt and the State
Department of General Services,

The explosion, which was caused
by a gas—pipe leakage according to
the Pittsburgh City Police, injured
49 people and totally destroyed two
lecture‘ halls, laboratory facilities
and offices; '

Originally, Equitable Gas -was
named in the complaints filed by
the various plaintiffs in the case, in-
cluding 15 people who were injured,
Pitt and the State Department of
General Services. Equitable then fil-

. ed a motion to bring Pitt, the State

Department of General Services,‘
and the Mellon-Staurt Company
(the general contractor for the con-
struction of Langley Hall) into the
case as defendants.

So Pitt and the State Department
of General Services were both
defendants and plaintiffs in the
case.

Equitable Gas charged that Pitt
was liable because it approved the
defective design of Langley Hall

you.” -
He promised to work for an
orderly transition to the
Republican administration that
will take office on Jan. 20. I
Flanked by his wife and the
high command of his vanquish-
ed administration, Carter told
downcast but applauding‘ sup-
porters at a Washington hotel:

course I accept that decision,

_ although not with the same en-

thusiasm I accepted it four years
ago.”

In that 1976 election, Carter
narrowly ousted Republican
President Gerald R. ‘Ford. It
took all night to settle that can-
test. This time, Carter had con- .

ceded the outcome and was,off-

stage by 10 p.m. EST.

The president-elect was at a
private dinner with friends
when Carter delivered his con-
cession statement at what was
supposed to have been a victory
rally. An aide said Carter» had
telephoned him earlier, ‘.‘con-~

ceded the election, wished him
well, and offered his assistance
during the transition."

Anderson had also phoned
Reagan his congratulations.

Carter discussed the situation
early Tuesday night in a
telephone call across the White
House to the office of press
secretary Jody Powell, who was
heard to say, ‘,‘Mr. President,
you’d better wait a few‘minutes
more.” He waited about two
hours.

His concession statement had
been prepared by early evening,

charged that Pitt failed to report
gaseous odors when they knew or
should have known that such odors
were likely to be highly combustible

that Pitt should not have scheduled

tion.

Pitt's Dickson Prize in Medicine Goes to Molecular Biologist

By SANDY LEBOVITZ

The distinguished Dickson Prize
of Pitt’s School of Medicine will be
presented to Dr. Philip Leder, a-
molecular biologist, for his con-
tributions to molecular genetics.

A gold medal and $10,000 will be
presented to Leder Nov. 12 by
Edison Montgomery, senior vice
chancellor for the health sciences in
a ceremony at Scaife Hall.

The Dickson Prize was set up by
the estates of Dr. Joseph 2.
Dickson, and his wife, Agnes
Fischer Dickson. Dickson specified
that two separate funds were to be
established and‘ known as the
“Dickson Prize in Science,” award-
ed by Carnegie-Mellon University,
“Dickson Prize in
Medicine” awarded by,Pitt. These
prizes were to be awarded to an out-
standing individual or group of in-
dividuals in each of the two areas.
The only stipulation was that the
recipients must be citizens of the
United States.

This year’s Dickson Prize reci-
pient, Leder, is chief of the
Laboratory of Molecular Genetics
at the National Institute of Child
Health and Human Development,
National Institutes of Health
(NIH). Leder received his M.D.
degree from Harvard Medical
School in 1960, and since 1962, he
has been affiliated with the NIH.

The NIH is a federal agency sup-
porting biomedical research into the
causes, prevention and cure of
diseases. It also supports research
training and the development of
research resources. The National
Institute on Child Health and
Human‘ Development (NICHD)
conducts and supports biomedical
and behavioral research on child
health and maternal health; pro-
blems of human development, and

 

on family structure.

Leder has been the recipient of
numerous scientific honors, in-
cluding: the National Institutes of
Health Director’s Award; the New
York Academy of Sciences Award
in Biological and Medical Sciences;
the Warren Triennial Prize of
Massachusetts General Hospital;
and the Virchow Memorial Lec-
tureship of the International Socie-
ty of Cell Biology in Berlin. He is a
member of the National Academy
of Sciences and has been chairman
of the Gordon Conference on
Nucleic Acids.

“.1 am interested in very basic
questions directed to the structure
and regulated expression of genes,”
Leder said.

“My future plans are to under-
stand fully and completely how an-
tibody genes work in man and other
animals,” he said.

“The Dickson Prize in Medicine
is one of the key events of the
year,” according to Dr. David J.
Kupfer, chairman of the Dickson
Prize Committee and professor of
psychiatry. According to a succes-
sion of medical school deans, the
Dickson Prize is also considered the
most prestigious event of the
school, Kupfer said.

Kupfer explained the search pro-

S cess for the Dickson Prize recipient:

The committee solicits candidates
by contacting previous Dickson
Prize winners, reviewing lists of
previous nominations, and seeking
nominations from the faculty of the
school. After receiving 15 to 20
nominations, the committee then
meets several times to extensively
review the candidates and narrow
the list down to about two or three
candidates. The committee
members obtain and review further
information on the remaining can-

  

didates before determining the win-
ner.

“The decision has been
unanimous since I’ve been the
chairman,” Kupfer said. He has
been the chairman for two years
and a committee member for three.

Every year the committee tries to
select an individual in an area
related to medicine who is working
at the forefront of their area of ex-
pertise. A balance over a period of
time is needed so as to vary the
areas of specialty, Kupfer explain-
ed.

The first Dickson Prize in
Medicine recipient was Dr. Earl W.
Sutherland, Jr., who received the
award in 1970. Since the Dickson

Prize started ten years ago, three.

recipients have won the Nobel
Prize. Sutherland was one of those
three. Sutherland was a Professor
of Physiology at the Vanderbilt
University School of Medicine in
Nashville, Tennessee. He received
the Dickson Prize for his con-
tributing to a better understanding
of hormones.

The two other recipients of the
Dickson Prize in Medicine who also
won the Nobel Prize were Rosalyn

S. Yalow, Ph.D. of the Veterans V
-Administration Hospital, Bronx,

New York, and Roger Guillemin,
M.D., Ph.D. of the Salk Institute,
San Diego, California.

Some of the Dickson Prize in
Science recipients from Carnegie-
Mellon_University were: Professor
George E. Palade of Rockefeller
University, Professor Keith R.
Porter ‘of the University of Col-
orado, Mr. Francis L. VerSnyder of
Pratt and Whitney Aircraft, and
Dr. David H. Geieger of Geiger
Berger Associates of New York.

Dickson was born in 1868 in
Carnegie, Pennsylvania. He
attended Washington and Jefferson

Judges, Activist Attomey Speak
At Tomonow’s Law Career Day

By PEGGY FERRI

Law Career Day will be held
Thursday, Nov. 6 in the Student
Lounge, where
representatives from over 25 col-
leges will talk with any students in-

Union Lower

terested in law.

“It’s a chance for students to
find out about law schools and talk

with some admissions directors,”

said Mark Patterson, president of

the Pre-Law Society.

The event will commence at
l:00p.m. with a keynote speech by
Superior Court Justice, John

Brosky.

“The speech may concern the

openness of the law field,” Patter-

son said. “The field isn’t as‘ crowd— '

ed as everyone thinks it is. There are
many different kinds of law.”

At 3:00 p.m. recently elected
Judge of Common Pleas, Steven A.
Zappala will also give a speech.

Defense Attorney William
Kunstler will deliver his speech en-
titled “Is There Justice in
America?” at 7:00 p.m. Kunstler is
a well known activist attorney
whose best noted defese cases in-
clude: The Chicago Seven (Abbie
Hoffman), Patti Hearst, the Ber-
rigan Brothers, and the anti-nuke

will conduct a lecture entitled,
“Cloning and the Emerging Con-
cept of the Mammalian Genome.”
The lecture will be held in Lecture
Room 6, Scaife Hall, and is open to
the public. The following day at
11:00 a.m., Leder will give a
seminar on “Somatic Instability: A
Cardinal Feature of Im-
munoglobulin Genes” in Room
618, Scaife Hall. '

Seabrook Seven.

“The Pre-Law Society is organiz-
ed to help undergrads learn all there
is about the legal profession,” Pat-
terson explained.

Law Career Day is an annual
event sponsored this year by: The
Pre-Law Society, Pitt Program
Council, Legal Awareness Commit-
tee, and Carnegie—Mellon’s and
Chatham’s Pre-Law organizations.

Patterson is confident that “this
year will undoubtedly be better than
last.”

Patterson explained,

‘‘We’re

‘

f

working on a hairline budget, but .

this year the SGB (Student Govern-
ment Board) ‘assisted us by re-

questing more money for the event.

Hopefully next ‘year that amount

will increase.’ ’

Also attending will be three
representatives from various testing
centers such as the National Center

for Educational Testing.

“Any student interested in law
should attend,” said Patterson.
“Often, students don’t decide that
they are interested in law until
they’re in their (junior or senior
year, but looking into it early is a
good idea too,”

Dutton said.

‘‘I think it should be understood
there is no easy time to make the
move of these offices,” Dutton
said. He added that the Mervis
facilities will provide about 27
square feet per person.

Herward, who’ went to the new
Student Loans Office said that she
found not more than five feet of
space between the counter and the
door of the student loans office.
She added that there were only
three people in line and “there were
problems just moving past each
other,” she said.

“This is only temporary inconve-
nience for a near future improve-
ment,” said Jack Freeman, Senior
Vice Chancellor for adminstration.
“We recognize there will be a

It seems that traffic rerouting in the Oakland area
has been very much in the news lately on the Pitt
campus. -

struck by a bus.

This week, members of the Student Government
Board discussed another problemithat has its roots in
the rerouting of buses.

The new Fifth Avenue bus traffic patterns have
caused PAT’s 61 (those travelling to Squirrel Hill)
routes to use Bigelow Boulevard as a throughway to
Forbes Avenue. Because of the rerouting, heavy bus
traffic has posed problems to students attempting to

' cross the boulevard while en route to the Cathedral

of Learning.

“As I see _it, there was a problem crossing Bigelow
before the lane opened and any additional vehicular
traffic will just make it worse,” according to Glenn
Walsh, spokesman for the SGB’s Commuter Affairs

_ Committee. .. .. _

According to PAT sources the bus drivers on the
61 routes have been advised to travel through the
Bigelow Boulevard area at a speed no greater than 15
mph. In addition, the drivers must have their head-
lights on at all times.

We agree wholeheartedly with Abraham on this

to impress upon the city the need for a stoplight,

The “Wealth of Nations” was

reason for my writing this letter-
Briefly, it ’ is to present the
background against which Smith
wrote. Forced labor: every man

chemistry library to reference a
book for a lab report. However, I
was told the book was not available
for useby undergraduates at Pitt,

some time. It was explained to me
that only graduate and research
students could use these books. The
infinitesimal utility these books
provide to the general student body

Hugh Green's Number 99 Jersey to Be Retired

Hugh Green

 

By MIKE DICIIIARA
Pitt News Sports Editor

The big story at yesterday’s foot-
ball press luncheon was not that
Louisville is coming to town Satur-
day to play the ninth-ranked Pan-
thers. The feature was that, during
halftime this week, the university
will officially retire I-Iugh Green's
number 99 jersey.

In a statement released by Pitt
Athletic Director Cas Myslinski,
Green was highly praised for his
outstanding play while wearing the
Panther blue and gold. As a
freshman, Green earned second-
team Associated Press All-America
honors, and the past two seasons he
has been named a consensus All-
America. Last season, he was the
only underclassman among the four
finalists for the Lombardi Award,
given annually to the nation’s
outstanding lineman. This year he is
the prime candidate for that award,
as well as being a strong challenger
for the 1980 Heisman Trophy.

“Four years ago I was saying that
these years would be needed to
mature me,” said Green. “I’m hap-
py with the way I played. There
were times when I wasn’t, but I’m
pretty much pleased.”

This will be the last time that

 

Green, as well as the rest of the
great class of seniors that are on the
Panther squad, will play on the Pitt
Stadium turf. Thus the game will
have extra meaning, despite it’s be-
ing played against an inferior team.

“We have one more game at
home,” said Green, “so I want to
do my best. We as a group want to
be known as the best defensive unit
ever here. After the game, I would
just like to stay out on the field and

watch the fans leave and savor th‘

moment.”

The question came up about what
Green would like to do after his col-
lege career. “I’ll miss the city,
school, people and atmosphere. I’d
like to play with a (pro) team where
I can play,” he said.

Once the much deserved praise
for Green was concluded, talk turn-
ed to the upcoming game against
Louisville. Cardinal coach Bob
Webber spoke about his team via a
telephone hook-up from Kentucky.

“This will be the biggest
challenge we've had here at UL in’
long time,” Webber said. “They’re
possibly the number one team in the
country.”

“We’ve not had consistent suc-
cess this year,” he added. “We got
off to a slow start, then the offense

got going for two or three games
and then nothing much lately.”

That statement seems valid when
lookinfover the Cards past games.
They have defeated Kansas, Mem-
phis State, and Indiana State by
averaging over 25 points per game.
Then the Cards have lost to Florida
State (52-0), Miami of Florida
(24-10), and three close contests to
only mediocre competition.

By ANNA ARLO'I'I'A
Pitt News Sports Writer

After starting off the 1980 soccer
season on a winning note with ﬁve
consecutive victories and the
possibility of breaking some
records, the Panther booters drop-
ped their sixth straight game by a
3-1 score to playoff-bound Indiana
to ﬁnish the year with a 7-8 record.

The Panthers and the Indians
competed in a very heated match
that saw a total of three yellow
cards and one red card given to
players from both squads for the
breakouts during the contest.

Indiana opened the scoring when
ace shooter Frank Wolk received a
crossed ball from a throw-in from
the left. Pitt fullback Jim
Hackworth blocked the shot initial-
ly, but Wolk caught his own re-
bound and successfully put Indiana
into a lead that they would never
relinquish.

The Panthers, however, came
back just a few minutes after the In-
diana score to tie the game at one
goal apiece. The score came when
an Indiana player was tabbed for a
foul within the penalty area. Junior

,co-captain Al Adelmann was
elected to take the shot from the
12-yard line and put the Panthers
on the scoreboard.

Indiana rebounded from that
Adelmann score two minutes later
and went ahead of the Panthers
with a Mark Deutsch tally. The
score took place after a Panther
center-forward passed the ball back
to his own defense of Tom Trempus
and I-Iackworth. Unfortunately for
the Panthers, Deutsch turned on his
speed and took the ball_ from the
pulled goalkeeper, Scott Thunberg,
out to the left of the goal and drib-
bled the ball into the net.

“The same thing that happened
in the rest of the losses happened in
the Indiana game," said Adelmann.
“The other team got an early lead
and we have what it takes to come
back and win. I do think that the
backs played better than they did in

ports

the few games
Indiana.”

Not long after Deutsch scored the
go-ahead goal, a ﬁght broke out at
midfield which resulted in
Adelmann receiving a yellow card
for his aggression. Not long after
that incident, it was Indiana who
was caught but a bit more seriously
with Deutsch being thrown out of
the contest with a red card. That
move put Indiana down for the re-
mainder of the game, and forced
them to push another player back
on defense, which made for added
pressure on the Panther attackers.

With 38:14 gone in the first half,
Indiana scored on a power-play
goal when John Dombroski put a
ball in the net and the Indians were
up, 3-1.

“In the second half, they hardly
had any shots on goal because they
played so much defense since they
were one man down,” said Don
Bowen. “But we didn’t take ad-
vantage and shift enough power up
to the offensive formation.”

No further scoring took place in
the second half, although two more
yellow cards were given to Wolk
and Troy Norton of the Panthers.
Another ﬁght broke out with only
six seconds remaining in the game.

Now, the Panthers look back
over what turned out to be a very
disheartc ing end of the season and
try to analyze where the problem
lies. A number of things have been
considered the root of the problem;
some are easily seen while others are
not.

One point, though, that does
seem consistent in the minds of
those who will return is that there is
reason to be optimistic for the year
to follow.

previous to

“I'm looking forward to a suc-
cessful indoor season this winter,”
added Adelmann. “Everyone will
be back except for three players
and, if we play more as a team, we
can ﬁll those vacant spots and build
more for next year from this one.”

“Our defense has been consistent
except against Florida State," said
Webber. “We’ve had moderate
success with the kicking game. We
have a good placekicker but only a
mediocre punter.”

Excluding the Florida State
debacle, Louisville has only allowed
about 15 points per game this
season. That will be the challenge
for the number five ranked passing
attack in the country. Rick
Trocano will be starting once again

in place of the injured Dan Marino.

This year's Pitt hockey team is a

been practicing at the stadium, said
Ludwig.

For the past five years, women's
field hockey has tried to establish
itself among the ranks of winning
Pitt teams. Until now, the Pan-
therettes have never had a winning
season. Their hour has come.

Pitt will be competing along with
eight other division II teams. Pitt,
La Salle, Bucknell, Lehigh,
Villanova, Towson State,
Lafayette, and Drexel were the
chosen eight Eastern teams for the
1980 regionals.

This tournament is comparatively
small,” said Ludwig. “In Ohio, as

many as 16 teams will be com-
peting.”

The Pantherettes face La Salle on
Friday in first-round single elimina-
tion, said Ludwig.

“Out of the eight teams, four
teams will lose; the four winning
teams will go onto second-round
Three of the
four teams will then go on to the na-

La Salle has the advantage, said

The team has had a little bit of a
layoff since their last game at
Bucknell, but Ludwig said that she
wasn't sure that Pitt would receive a
bid.

“We could have had a record of
9-0 and still not have received a
bid,” she added.

“Our practices last week weren't
real intense,” said Ludwig, “but
since Sunday when we received the

Team Looks Ahead to Successful Year

Any improvement is due, in large
part, to a new assistant coach,
Larry Newell. Newell has played
hockey professionally in the minor
leagues and, while at Pitt, made it
to the final round of trials for the
1976 Olympic team.

Last year, he made the transition

from player to coach. Over the
summer he initiated a dry-land

Women Netters End0n Bitter Note

By MARIE HUFF

Pitt News Sports Editor

The Pantherettes ended their
season on a sour note, dropping
their final two matches to Rutgers
and Maryland in a tournament this
past weekend. The netters ﬁnished
the season with a record of 5-7.

Rutgers won by a 6-3 margin.
Senior Randi Belkin led Pitt with
victories in both the singles and
doubles competition. Belkin
outlasted Patti Hogan, 7-5, 6-4. She
then teamed with Cathy Jacobson
to defeat Diane Ventura and Tonia
Dillon. 6-2, 3-6, 6-3. Lisa Weinberg
scored the only other win for the
Pantherettes. Weinberg shut down
Martha Barton, 6-3, 6-2.

Cathy Jacobson, hampered by a
muscle pull, lost to Diane Ventura,

' LaFuria and Kastory, 7-6, 6-2.

O’Byrne, 6-1, 6-2. Jody Mattioli
suffered a 3-6, 6-3, 7-5 loss to Randi
Silverman.

Rutgers took the other two
doubles matches from Pitt after
Belkin and Jacobson tallied their
win. Hogan and Barton defeated
In
the final match, Silverman and
Wendi Blau combined to victimize
Weinberg and Gretchen Raak, 6-4,
6-2.

Perennial powerhouse Maryland
whitewashed the Pantherettes, 9-O.
Belkin suffered her second loss of
the season, 6-3, 6-3 to Wendy Fine.
Jacobson forfeited her match due
to the aggravation of her muscle
pull. Lisa Weinberg looked im-
pressive even though she lost, a 6-3,
6-3 fight to the end with Nancy
Horowitz. Jacobson came back to

7-6. 6-3- Lisa 1-aFUfia ft“ Victimﬁltm team with Belkin, but to no avail, as

they lost their third match of the
season, 4-6, 7-§_, 6-1 to Wendy Fine

CO.

and Mary Poebel.

Despite the losing record, the
feeling among players was one of
satisfaction. They really ap-
preciated Coach Webster taking
over the team on such short notice
at the beginning of the season.
According to team members, his in-
telligence of the game and charming
approach made them want to win
not just for the team, but for him.

Coach Fran Webster contended
that the scores were a bit
misleading. “The girls really did a
fine job. I think their determina-
tion was epitomized in Cathy
Jacobson. She pulled a muscle in
her first match, but insisted on
playing." Webster also expressed
optimism for next year, when six
players will return to the squad. ‘‘I
don’t think we ended the season on
the bad note, when yougink of the
vast improvement and next year's
outlook."

Arena, and at a rink in Beaver.

“The big improvement this year
is in attitude," Newell said. “The
intensive training has brought these
guys together into a cohesive unit.
Our goal this year is to work as a
team rather than a group of in-
dividuals.”

According to Newell, the team is
more talented than it has been in the
past, and is larger than it's ever
been. This season's roster lists 22
players.

The schedule has been upgraded
to develop better playing skills, and
increase the level of competition.
The first half of the season, accor-
ding to Newell, will be a build-up,
and the second half should be at a
more consistent and difficult level
of play.

“It’s a long season, the longest
one we’ve ever had,” Newell said.
‘‘In the first part, I’m looking to
test my own ideas on style. My goal
is to have the team reach its peak
around the time we go to New
York."

The Pitt team will play St. John's
and Ramapo in New York over the
Christmas holidays. During the
bulk of the season that will follow,
the‘ toughest competition is ex-
pected from Navy and Kent State.

This weekend the Pitt team opens

its season against the University of
Ohio. Newell is expecting a good
game from them, and a good test of
his team's abilities.

Ohio has about 30 percent of its
players from the Pittsburgh area so
there is a strong rivalry between the
two teams. Newell is expecting to
gain no matter what the outcome.

“Physically we’re ready, but
mentally they’re impatient,” said
Newell. “We’ve had a delay in the
exhibition season when C.M.U.
didn't show for a game, so there's
that frustration from all that prac-
tice without any outlet. But we’re
getting them fired up for this
weekend.”

Last week it looked like injuries
would be a major factor working
against the team but, according to
Newell, the whole team, except for
one player, is 100 percent ready to
play.

“l’ve had a few guys see
specialists over the weekend, and I
think the week of rest has done
them a lot of good,” said Newell.
“We’re going to wait and see how
some of them look for this
weekend.”

Newell is expecting a close mat-
chup between the two teams, with a
lot of big plays.
