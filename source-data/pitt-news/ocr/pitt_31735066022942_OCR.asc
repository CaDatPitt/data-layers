  ‘ Bernstein ys There Is

Pitt News Staff Writer

Although the media has im-

- proved in its coverage of news

sinceVWatergate, there is still room

for improvement “through re- ,

examining and’ reevaluating’ its

,‘priorities, according to Carl

Bernstein, former reporter for the
Washington Post. _ »

Bernstein, along with fellow
reporter Bob Woodward, helped
expose the activities of the‘Nixon.
‘administration after the Watergate
break-in and during the subse-
quent coverup. , .

One of the media’s chief
problems is its tendency to _heap

T, laurels. on itself for uncovering

Watergate and other major stories
since the s;andal, "Bernstein told a

capacity crowd in the ‘Student.

Union Ballroom Tuesday evening.

“The press, right now andsince
Watergate, ﬁnds itself in the midst
of an orgy of self-congratulation,”
Bernstein said. ’

Statistics from Columbia Univer-
sity concerning how many re-
porters on the Washington beat

actually covered the Watergate _

break-in and coverup contradicts
this attitude, according to» Bern-
stein. Of the approximately 2,000
reporters covering Washington,
only .14 actually covered the
Watergate scandal on a full-time
basis. -

Woodward, and Bernstein ‘oc-
cupied an advantageous position

’ because they were not members of
the prestigious national press corps ~

which worked under preconce_ived

p‘,not_ions- about covering national‘

tories. Instead,Bern's1_ein said, he.

 

s “ar_1_c‘l ‘Woodward started from the 0:,

 

_ bottom and worked their way up

using a “very simple empirical
process.” '
' While members of the national
press corps. queried individuals
involved with Nixon in the company
of White House attorneys, Wood-
ward and Bernstein worked at
night, interviewing people in the
privacy of their homes, Bernstein
said. - ‘
This method resulted in “quite
extraordinary” «information about

the details of the scandal which the _

national press and federal. law
enforcement agencies investigating
the scandal~"failed to obtain.

The, White House responded to,"

the articles. published by the
Washington’ Post by attacking the
press/rather than answering the
charges of wrong doing by Nixon’s
associates, said Bernstein, s

“-The White House sought to
make the conduct of the press the
issue in Watergate ratherthan the
conduct of the president and his
men,’,’ Bernstein said.

Bernstein termed the responses
of ‘the White House officials
“non-denial denials” in thatthe
officials’ never directly answered
any of the charges. ' Instead, the
officials called press reports attacks

based on hearsay and innuendoes.’

‘ _ “But almost never did they (the
officials) controvert the facts in our
stories,” Bernstein added.

The Nixon Administration’s at-
tacks on the press left its mark on
the minds of the American people.
The “legacy” left by the Nixon
administration is still prevelant in

some respects, with the credibility

of the American press still in
question, according to Bernstein.

billing process and the problems
encountered in the change. .

The new validation process now A
provides a small green sticker to be‘
placed on the back of the student
identification cards. On the newer
cards the sticker will be placed in
the small box designated, “not
valid without validation sticker”,
Passarello said. A’ '

“The new 'I.D. cards were made
this way because we had been
anticipating this change,” he
added.

Passarello noted that the old I.D.
cards have room for the sticker, in
the side opposite the hole and that
it should_ not interfere with any of
the perforations. -

Students will not receive this
sticker until the current bi1_l is‘paid',
Passarello\noted. He added that
idea is the same principle as the
blue validation cards but eliminates
the need for students to carry two
kinds of cards.

A problem that the office

:

A encountered in changing to this

new format was the distribution of
the sticker. to students,’ since
the stickers. are so Small that it
would have been necessary to have
them stuffed manually into en-

‘basic to the Nixon administration,”
said Bernstein. “The contempt we

_now see) for the “press -(by

Americans) is quite deep-seated.’.’
Bernstein said that some of the
complaints concerning the press
are legitimate, because “we don’t
do our job well enough."; ' ’
One problem with today’s press
is that “while it demands openness
of other institutions” it remains a”
closed institution, reyealing -little
about how it operates to its public.
This characteristic perpetuates the
public’s view of the press as an_

- "arrogant” institution, Bernstein‘

said. i -
_ Today’s p\r§s_,s' operates .-unde
what Bernstein calls neo-journal-'
ism concentration. on rion-news
items. - I ' -
Three trends under this cate-
gory,_he said, include emphasizing
gossip about prominent personal-
ities, paying news sources. to
appear. on television news pro-
grams and devoting "large sections
of newspapers and excessive funds
to report gossip-oriented news.
Truth is becoming a secondary
priority in some instances with
trivial news taking precedence over
signiﬁcant newsworthy items. The

media is em hasizin “what we
. P 8

(the press) think they (the public)
want rather than what we know is
news,” he added. '

Bernstein said there is room for’
personality-oriented stories but not
at “the expense of reporting""'hard

I news.

7,‘ In ‘addition, when’ reporters do
cover hard news stories, they act as

velopes, Passarello said. The
office has solved, this problem by
designating placesto pick up the
stickers, if the bill was paid by
mail,.he added.

To pick up this sticker, a-student

must present the receipted original .

tuition statement at G-33 CL, they
will receive the sticker from, the
counter clerk. However, about
8,000 students had received early
bills and because the ofﬁce found it
necessary to wait until the last
minute for the arrival of the
stickers, these students were
informed that the billing statement

_would be the validation needed.

“We used that as a stop gap
measure, until we could try to
inform the students of the new
sticker method-. We felt that the
student needed some temporary’
proof to insure that the or she
wouldn’t be deprived of services at
‘the university.”

This statement was never in-
tended to be the validation card, he
added, but the time factor with\

,sticker’s arrival caused‘ some.

confusion about its intended
purpose. 0

The new sticker will replace all
the old services of the blue
validation. card_, Passarello noted.

‘This includes receiving football -
,’tickets and _use' of the health

service.

New Validation and Billing Process, Encounters Problems  

To avoid any invasions of the
student privacy, offices like ,Stu-'

vices will also receive a computer

,-printout from .the registrar's office 5‘

of students currently registered fo
a particular term.  "

“That way, alstudent won’t have
to show his statement to anyone,
and will still have proof that he is

entitled tothese services,” Pas-_S

sarello noted.

The new sticker is intended to” 0‘

simplify things for the student, and
is also tied in with the security
system of the university,
Passarello. ‘
“Putting a spring validation
sticker over'the winter one before
the term has expired would

invalidate your winter sticker and ,

you would not have proof , of
registration for. that term,” added.

  Plane Crashes Into

Volcano Kills 257     

By The Associated Press

CHRISTCHURCH, New Zea-
land-—The pilot of the Air New
Zealand DC-10 that crashed into a
remote Antarctica volcano, killing
all 257 persons aboard, apparently
made a navigational error that took
him on the “wrong” side of the
wind-lashed mountain, the head of
the recovery operation said ‘~Thurs-
day.

An airline spokesman acknow-
ledged that the pilot, Capt. Jim
Collins, 45, had never ﬂown thetAir
New Zealand Antarctic sightseeing
route before. But spokesman Jim
Berry refused -to comment on a
possible cause for the crash.

An adv/ance team of
three mountaineers Thurs-
day reached the crash site, 1,500
feet up the side of 12,400-foot-high’
Mount.Erebus, reported no sign of
survivors and_- said they spotted 60
or 70 bodies, a" U.S. Nav/v
spokesman said. ,

But it was clear the recovery
effort would be an awesbme task:

\the climbers said a polar blizzard

was already covering the wreckage

and bodies with snow.

The_ death toll in Wednesday’s
crash, including 21 Americans, was
the fourth-highest in aviation
history. It was the third fatal
accident involving a DC-‘10 this
year, and it aroused new demands

that the McDonnell Douglas plane '

be grounded.’ _

The director of the British Safety
Council advised travelers to “shun
the DC-10, and two lawmakers in
Britain and West. Germany de-
manded that their countries ban
the plane until after an investiga-
tion ‘of the NewTZealand crash.

_ Some air-safety experts contend

the DC-10 has dangerous design
ﬂaws, a charge the manufacturer
heatedly disputes.

leader of the crash-recovery mis-
sion, said it appeared to him that
the pilot,. not the plane, was to
blame. '

Speaking with reporters in

Auckland, New Zealand, before
heading for the crash area 2,000
miles south of here, he said the
plane was supposed to have been
ﬂying past the northwest side of
Mount Erebus but slammed into
the northeast side.

The DC-10s normally fly past the
smoldering volcano at about 2,000
feet as part of Air New Zealand’s
aerial tour of spectacular polar
sights. .

“It would seem there has been a
substantial error in navigation by
the pilot,” Thomson said. “In my
opinion the plane was certainly in
the wrong place to come down so
low.” I ,

He did not elaborate,
treacherous. winds
areas often pose a danger to

but

“aircraft, and unpredictable drafts

around active volcanos can be
particularly -dangerous. The
western route past Erebus off the
Antarctica coast on Ross _Island,
would have taken the plane over
the frozen sea of McMurdo Sound.

Opinion

A StepForward
g ForBackspace

Backspace, Pitt’s literary magazine, has been‘

chosen by a panel of judges as the second best college
literary magazine in the country. The significance

of this‘ award "in the Thirteenth Annual Literary A

Magazine contest is that it was ,- one of over one
hundred magazines_entered in the contest. ,
Judges said the magazine exhibits “excellent prose

writing” and possesses a “serious, professional»
approach.” In addition, the judges commended the

magazine for “its moments of stunning honesty and
depth and its interesting, adventurous, sophisticated,

,,

What makes the award even more significant is
that Backspace is now a nationally-known, widely
acclaimed literary journal-among thertop in the
nation—yet few people at Pitt are ‘a‘i'Nare that it
exists. That’s a sad commentary for our university.

University support for the magazine is non-
existent. It receives no unversity funding as it is
"funded solely by the Student Activities fee. — This
leaves the magazine at the mercy of the-Student
Government Board every year, dependent on -the
preferences of the individuals on the Board.

The magazine was lucky during the last allocations
process, by receiving almost $2,000 to pay for
operating costs. Fortunatly for Pitt students and the
magazine’s staff, that is enough to keep the magazine

‘solvent for the remainder of the year.

One would think that a ‘magazine of Backspace,’s ,

quality would receive some academic support from
the English Department.‘ Not so—’the department,
unlike other universities across the country, has no
affiliation with the half-fiction, half-poetry journal.

Backspace has done very well despite these
roadblacks. ’ +'—~

First, it still exists while other publications on
campus like the Skyscraper (an engineering journal)
and Eureka (a journal of science) have fallen by the
wayside. . ’ I

In its sixth year of publication, the magazine has
‘ managed to improve its appearance. Originally in a

" more appealing price (one dollar). .
The magazine will be published again in January. 5

The biggest question that comes to mind is.who isw '
responsible for propelling this giant of a journal-to it-Vs’ ,

current height of national prominence? _ * ‘ ~ -

   
  
    
  
  

One obvious answer is the people who contribute: " rt

Perhap a’ better answer to the question“‘i_s the
journal’s advisor—La_rry Lunsford. The ‘Backspace '
staff has nothing but positive things to say about,“

Lunsford, whosefaith in the journal’s leadership has»

 
  
  
  
  
  
   

helped motivate that leadership into producing ’a\ ,_ 

quality publication. While virtually every “-other
admininstrator at Pitt has ignored Backspace,

Lunsford has supported it through his professional?

attitude and confidence in its staff. .
No one really knows what lies ahead

organizations at Pitt still strive for national

recognition, Backspace can rest assured that it is.one_ _
of the best of its kind. Theonly thing left to hope for i
is its continued success and a little attention from the «l

Dancing girls, sword swallowers,
—magicians and acrobats combined
expertise and hilarity to make
“Chinese Acrobats & Magicians of
Taiwan” a fantastic evening of
entertainment. The show recently
playedto an appreciative audience
at Heinz Hall for the Performing
Arts last Monday night.

The majority of acts were based
on suspense, relying on a “can you
top this” strategy that was
undoubtably the cause of many
unplanned manicures. In

“Balancing Fantasy” when two
acrobats, one perched atop the
other’s head, climbed up, over and
down a ladder the audience was
more than amazed.‘ But when the

tumbling was precise and
ﬂamboyant. embellished by high
leaps and ﬂips through the air. The
acrobats added suspense to the act
by torching the rings and bounding
through the ﬂaming circles,
blindfolded, while the audience,
watched nervously.

Welcome breaks from this
intensity were provided by eight
dancing girls who appeared
intermittently throughout the show.
They sprinkled ﬂower petals in
“Fan Dance,” in the folk tradition
of village girls remembering
boyfriends far away from home.
“Ribbon Dance” was gracefully,
choreographed weaving long,’
colorful scarves across the stage in
intricate patterns.

Many acts demonstrated the
limits to which the body could be
pushed. Acrobats withtmuscles and"

female described as having ‘ ‘a
super throat and stomach”
swallowed a glow-in-the-dark sword
that appeared to be the length of a
human arm. And if that wasn’t
enough, the lights were turned out
and the Heinz Hall audiencewas
treated to a view of the girl’s
esophagus.

. , Cover Story

‘‘I’m basically more of an R&B
rock. n’ roller and the music was
getting kind of jazz-like. I just
kind of lost interest with being
involved with the Doobie Brothers.
Iwanted to do a solo album
anyways,” explained Tom Johnston
in a calm, quiet voice as he relaxed
on a couch prior to his Thanksgiving
night concert at the Decade.

Johnston initiated the formation

 of the Doobie Brothers in 1970. He
A was responsible, perhaps more

~ ’  than any other member of the band,

for the Doobie’s unique sound and
quick success. A guitarist/vocalist,
Johnston penned over 30 songs
with the Doobies, including such
hits as “Listen To The Music,”

‘ ‘Rockin’ Down The Highway,”

— “Long Train ‘ Runnin’,” “China
Grove,” “Eyes Of Silver,” and
“Another Park, Another Sunday.”
Conﬂicting musical interests and

~ poor health, however, forced him to

leave the band in January of 1977,
"during the recording of “Livin’ On
‘The Fault Line.” '

“We’re all still friends,” said

Jo nston as he spoke about his

relationship with the Doobies

"today. “I think they sound

great; they’re doing what they want

“ to do.” Johnston has even made '/

several guest appearances with the

band over the past two years.
Yet Johnston’s present interest is
in pursuing a solo career. He said
, he had thought about recording a
solo album for three years before»
‘ leaving the Doobie Brothers but it
wasn’t until after his departure that

‘ / he got serious about the idea.

After a year in the studio,
Johnston's idea has become a
reality with the release of
“Everything You’ve Heard Is
True," his first solo album.

‘ ‘It was different at ﬁrst, ”
reflected Johnston about going into
the studio to do a solo album.
,“There wasn't a group thing
happening where everybody had to
make up their minds what’s going

to happen on a record. I had the
songs written and it evolved over a
period of time as to what would ‘
happen with those songs.”

“Everything You’ve Heard Is
True” contains seven original
compositions. “Show Me,” by Joe
Tex, is the albums only cover
number. One Tune. “0utlaw,"
was originally.scheduled for release

Ex-Doobie Brother Tom Johnston brought his new band to the Decade for

a Thanksgiving show.

on’the Doobie’s “Livin’ On The
Fault Line” album. Because of
Johnston’s vocals and guitar lines,
his solo effort is often /reminiscent
of the pre-“Fault Line” Doobies.
Johnston shys away from such
comparisons to his former band,
insisting instead on the good nature.
of the album’s music. -~
“It’s just an up-tempo,
have-a-good-time album. But it’s
real music, its like getting back to
real music,” Johnston said.
emphasizing the word “real.”
“Real music in my book that is, as
opposed to glaring guitars or guys
that can't sing too good. 'Or disco.”
Although he dislikes disco,

Johnston said he is not opposed to
danceable music. Songs like “I Can
Count On You,” “Savannah
Nights,” and “Down Along The
River” from the album easily lend
themselves to dancing.

Burwell Photo ’

“Being able to dance to a song
does not mean it’s disco. Ithink
dancing is ﬁne. The thing about
disco’s is they put a programmed
beat to it, and they put up all these
fucking lights and they make these
big whirly-ma-gig floors and
everybody goes in_and its called a ,
DISCO. But people are still

dancing. ya know. People can

dance t/o anything as long as

they've got a_ place to dance and the

. music is danceable,” Johnston said,
‘‘ Ted Templeman, whom.Johnston
has known since the early Doobie
A days, produced “Everything

You’ve Heardtls True” and adds
backing vocals with Nicolette
Larson. Also behind Johnston is
the Tower.‘Of Power Horn Section
and the Memphis Horns. At the
Decade, Johnston’s band consisted
of Michael White on bass, Greg
Douglas (Steve Miller Band, Hot

  Stray Doobie‘ Tom Johnstontill Rockin’ Down The Highway

%’//f /,,

Tuna) On guitar, Phil Aaberg and
Jim Anderson (both from Elvin
Bishop) on keyboards and drums
respectively and the Memphis '
Horns. Also on drums was John
Hartman, another stray Doobie and
a long time friend of Johnston.
“We started playing together
back in ’69. We both had a common
bond in Moby Grape. He was out
there (California) trying to get in a
band with some of those people and
Iknow Skip Spence real well at the
time, started hanging around with
him,” said Johnston as he

. described his relationship with

Hartman. “We’re good friends.

We know each other better than the ,
rest of the band (Doobie Brothers) '_
and I would want to know each
other-. Iknow Pat (Simmons) real .

' well too but not on the level I know
J ohn. ’ ’_-

Upstairs in the dressing room,

’ Johnston and the other,members of
the band did some spirited
vocalizing before the show. -This '
was their first apearance outside of
California. Any out-of-‘state jitters,
however, faded in their rousing '
chorus of songs like “Twisting The
Night Away.-” ‘ V ,

Downstairs, on stage, Johnston
wore a number 88 Steeler jersey
and jeans. He alternated between
new songs like “Show Me” and

_ “Outlaw” and Doobie classics like
 “Rockin’ Down The Highway,”

’ “Listen To The Music” and “Dark
Eyed Cajun Woman.” On these
later songs, if you were listening .
outside, you might have thought
the Doobie Brothers were playing ,
the Decade. But afterall, two ﬁfths
of them were. .

The set lasted two hours.

3 _ Throughout the show, Johnston’s

‘band played tightly around him.

The Memphis Horns were an , ,
especially nice touch to the sound.

A packed crowd at the Decade

seemed to enjoy every minute of

i this holiday concert.

A bachelor, Johnston also enjoys
V riding his Harley and playing
, _sports. But» music, writing,
singing and playing guitar is his
main source of pleasure. ~
“It’s all part of the involvement.

I mean I’m not the world’s best

singer, I know that, but I wouldn’t

. give up singing. I sure as hell

wouldn’t giveup playing the guitar.

And writing is why I keep doing the

thing Ido. It’s my reason for

keeping on. " j

A white Cadillac pulls to the curb of the
King’s Court theater in Oakland. He
steps out in faded, baggy jeans, a ski cap
pulled over his bald head and large wire
rims atop his nose. He's not a very tall
man, but the faces turn to him as he
enters the theater. He's Dusty Nelson,
the Carnegie-Mellon graduate who has
just written and directed his first feature
length ﬁlm, “Effects,” an intricate story
of suspense.

Along with Pat Buba and John
Harrison, who both coproduced the ﬁlm
(Harrison also played Lacey in the
picture), Nelson is an optimistic man who
has a ﬁne product that he’s attempting to
sell. '

Founded in 1973, [Image Works, the
film production company started by the
trio. has wide ﬁlm experience. But
“Effects” was their ﬁrst feature length

' . film, a culmination of one year of efforts, .

 SHOWCASE Interview

SHOWCASE talked to Nelson and Buba
at a recent showing of their ﬁlm.
SHOWCASE: Is the story of “Effects”
one that closely follows the book it is
based on? '

NELSON: No, it takes the idea, but most
of it is different. William Mooney’s book
was never published. I was a friend of
his, and I liked the books, so I asked him
if I could do..a screenplay with it. So, I
wrote it up, it took over a year, made a
bunch of copies, and we raised the money
and did it.

SHOWCASE: The screenplay was im-
pressive. the way it moved with all its
complexities.

NELSON: Yeah, for some people it really
works‘, and for other people it was too
complicated, and they just didn’t like
following» it. I always thought that would
help sell it, but I don't know.

SHOWCASE: Possibly some people just
.don’t want to think? I ~
NELSON: Yeah, well that’s kind of an

 

/
;

elitist view. It's not even that I feel that 1

it’s above ther1,or anything, I think it’s
just that people look at films in different
ways. For some people, watching ﬁlms is
just like watching television. Just like
anything ‘else. they want to be
entertained. They don't want to be
involved at all. On the other hand, that’s
not always true. You take a movie that’s
very simplistic, like “Rocky.” People
want to be involved emotionally, and that,
I think, is another problem with this ﬁlm,
I don't know if it involves people
emotionally. It involves them on a gut
level, but it's not an easilyrecognizable
emotional level. It is always a little bit
frightening in ways.

SHOWCASE: What happens after it »

leaves King's Court on‘ Sunday?

NELSON: well be doing what we're .
doing right now. Jon (Harrison) is at a’

ﬁlm festival in Houston. We entered the
ﬁlm, and it was ‘accepted. The right

SHOWCASE: You're sort of going by

NELSON: Right, it’s really all a matter of
getting a point across to people. Getting
people to look at it, to review it, to think
about it, to talk about it, and ultimately,
to sell it. We know, for instance, that it’s
not an exploitation ﬁlm. The basic
distributors don't know how to deal with
it. They say. maybe it’s an art ﬁlm. I
know I certainly didn't make it as an art
ﬁlm. I don't think I even know what an
art ﬁlm is. Some people say that we've

 F|eetwoodMac Concert—|ndividual Talents Form Solid Unit

_ By SCOTT MOWRY

Fleetwood Mac/Danny Duma and
'Nighteyes
Civic Arena ’
November 26, 1979

With all the self-centeredness and
ego-mania that has mocked the 70s, it is
truly refreshing to see a group of
people committed to their ideals in a_ bond
of togetherness. Fleetwood Mac are just
those type of people. V

On stage collectively, Fleetwood Mac is
like an intricate piece of machinery,
driven by heart and soul. Separately, the

‘ "five members of the group each make a
vital and irreplaceable contribution to the
Fleetwood Mac sound.

After two separate cancellations and a

‘ 2‘/2-year absence from this city, the
Anglo American supergroup finally made
an appearance in Pittsburgh and
delivered perhaps one of the most
exhilarating concert shows of the year last

, Monday night. It seemed worth the wait.-

With a professional elegance,
Fleetwood Mac cooly chugged through 23
songs from their past three enormously
successful albums, the only exception
being “Oh Well,” a Peter Green tune
from the old Mac days. ' -

Surprisingly enough, behind all the hit

' singles, multi-platinum record sales and’
million dollar promotional campaigns
, there stands a superior 2‘/2-hour live

  performance that——committ_ed to a devout

artistic integrity—speaks for itself. In a
word Fleetwood Mac's concert “was-
magical.
, The feeling of unity and unpretentious-
ness was infectious, spreading through-
out the sparsely seated Civic Arena as the
Mac people repeatedly apologized for
their past cancellations and expressed
- their happiness to play before a Steel City

audience. Perhaps the only disappointing‘

aspect of the evening was the Arena
attendance which was wellunder 9,000.
But when you ask $15.00 for a ticket, what
can you expect?

It was difficult to single out any
member of Fleetwood Mac as better or
worse than another because they all’ gen-
erously shared the spotlight with one
another and shined when it was their
turn. Stevie Nicks, however, still

i’ appeared to suffer from some voice
difficulties as she was unable to hit a few
high notes here and there. But that
hardly slowed the evening's pace.

The centerpiece of the show was Mick
Fleetwood, ‘whose crisp, surging drum-
ming provided the inspirational leader-
ship from which the remainder of the Mac
took off from. Fleetwood attacked his kit

with such precision and conﬁdence/,,.

quickness and dexterity that the way his
sticks waved was astounding, yet he
never. wavered from a steady and sure
backbeat. '

.Flee_twood was especially strong during -
, the opening number, “Say You‘ Love-.

' - Me_,f ’ 'which immediately kicked the show

John Movie, Mick Fleetwood and Lindsey Buckingham, Monday night.

Buffenm yer photo
and riff and ping that always seemed to '

into high gear, as well as “Tusk,” where
his numerous solo breaks seemed to pick
up speed continually. Near the end of the
evening Fleetwood-—all six foot six of
him—emerged from behind his drums to
play an exhibition of the log drum during
“World Turning.”
, Linsey Buckingham was the group’s
e‘nergy,»for it was the adrenalin from his
voice and guitar that pushed the group to‘
consistently outdo themselves with each
successive number.

Buckingham was a magnetic perform-
er. He didn’t merely play the guitar but
instead squeezed out every possible wail

érack with a freshness. Buckingham’s
guitar playing charged “The Chain,”
“You Make Loving Fun,” “I’m /So
Afraid,” and “Go Your'Own Way” with
incredible drive and power.

In contrast with his singing on record, C
Buckingham’s voice was fueled with
a passionate but harmonious wallow that
bordered on punk. “Not That Funny,”.
“What Makes You Think You’re the
One,” and “Tusk” all had a new wave
feel to them as he reached down deep for
the toughness. ‘Buckingham also sung
eighuberantly, but not quite so rogghly on

“Oh Well,” “World Turnin,’ ”
“Second Hand News.”

The earthiness and warmth of the band
was-put across by Christine McVie. Her
softly expressive singing on “Say You
Love Me,” “Oh Daddy” and the ﬁnal
encore of “Songbird” were easily the
most beautiful songs of the evening.

McVie also displayed tremendous
musicianship in handling guitars, -syn-
thesizer, and a great blues. piano on
“D0n’t Stop” andiat one point in the
show, during “Tusk” she even‘p/layed the
iaccordian. ’

Stevie Nicks tied the group together
like a ribbon ,wrapped around ‘a
Christmas present. With her aloof and
mysterious sensuality, Nicks, when she
remained on stage after changing clothes
several times'during the show, was the
group’s focal ‘point. Her slightly unique
renditions of the haunting “Rhiannon,”
“Landslide,” 7“Sister of the Moon” and
“Sara,” occasionally‘ featured diverse
phrasing and‘ different vocal emphasis.

. Last but not least, John McVie'held the
Fleetwood Mac sound together with solid
and steady basswork most apparent on
“Angel” and “Beautiful Child.” ,

Throughout the show, a variety of pop
dressings,‘ backdrops and curtains
weaved the images of the songs into an
aesthetic who/le. Even the lighting had a
tasteful mood and effect that made this
show a welcome and wonderful change

and

_from the lesser, unconcerned and

unfeeling musicians. If you _missed the
show because of the ﬁfteen buck price
you missed more "than a concert, you
missed anevent.

‘Civic Arena‘
November 23, 1979

/

The,Florida Guitar Army’ invaded
Pittsburgh last Friday night, and their
tight-but-rowdy show proved both that
the Outlaws. can do more than just
jam, and that Southern rock has
displaced British hea‘vy—meta~l ' as
P_ittsburgh’s favorite music. .

Taking the stage amid the sound of

six-man ban"d from Tampa opened
with the instrumental “Waterhole”
and their first hit single, “There Goes
Another Love Song.” Bassist Harvey
Dalton Arnold then took the lead on
Henry Paul’s “Freebo‘rn Man,” which
moved'quickly into “Takelt Any Way
You Want It.” Three cuts from their
new album, “In The Eye Of The

moving, pop-oriented material, which
showed their class as a live act. But on
this sultry night that should _have made

i the Florida musicians feel right at

home, the capacity, crowd of 17,524

had come to hear theblazing guitar ,

work that is the Outlaws’ trademark.
,“Blueswater,” from the new album,

provided the first real opportunity for

lead guitarists Hughie Thomasson and

Billy Jones to cut loose, as the intensity »

of the music andthe crowd began to
build.. After a one-hour, thirteen song
set, the band left the stage and the call
‘began for what has become- one of the
best-known moments in rock’n’ roll. -
After one quick throwaway tune in
the encore, the number which most of
the crowd had come to see and hear
followed:
“Green Grass and High Tides.”
'1'homasson’s guitar work was equal to
the'song’s stature as a rock classic, but
Jones seemed intent on playing fast at
the expense of coherence and
‘technique, many times making it hard
to tell just what he was trying to do.

, --If the Outlaws are a “guitar army,”

a 23-minute version of‘-

maybe the night’s opening act, Molly

Hatchet, should be dubbed the’

“amplifier brigade.” Their brand of
Southern all-guitar‘ rock was much
louder than. it was tight, but the
screaming ‘crowd was probably still,
louder for most of the hour-long, nine
song set. i -

This six-man ensemble from.

Jacksonville belongs in the warm-up
spot it occupied. Their show is paced

like a warm-up should be. Getting to_

numbers like “Gator Country” and
“Dreams I’ll Never See” quickly, their

attempts at movement on stage were

obviously forced, and lead singer

Danny Joe Brown wasnearly lifeless, ‘

both vocally and visually. But lots of
loud guitars can get a crowd riled up,
so in that respect the Hatchet men did
their job. ' . '

The crowd itself was noteworthy in

two respects; one, the average age had. ’

leaving Ted with a time-consuming job

The story moves slowly, and then the
pace quickens, but the" period that it
canvasses is somewhat unimportant. The

the father and son cope with loss of
someone they both love, as well as the
ordeal of acquainting themselves with
each other. It is obvious that they are

The album the music world has
waited three years for is ﬁnally
there. It’s Stevie Wonder’s

#3.» “Journey Through The Secret Life
Of Plants” and it’s well worth the
wait. in

“The Secret Life Of Plants” is a
surprisingly well-rounded concept
album. Every song, in one way or
another, has something to do with
plants’ feelings, powers, function
or being. Most of this album is
exerpts from the motion picture
soundtrack “The Secret Life Of

by Wonder either in total or in part,

Side three begins with the

beautiful single “Send One Your’

‘ follows as one of the more
traditional Wonder tunes on the
album. “Ecclesiastes” is yet
another mellow synthesizer
interlude (there are six on the
album). “Come Back as a Flower”
showcases the wonderful voice of
Syreeta Wright on lead vocal while
Wonder handles all the instru-
ments and background voice. The
melody is simple and easy ﬂowing
and Syreet'a’s voice as always is
more than adequate.”

Sid four is the grand finale of an
unbelievable album. “A Seed’s A

Gilda Radner
Warner Brothers _ ;
Over the past ﬁve years, Gilda
Radner has created one of the most
amusing assortmentof characters .
in the history ofcomedy. As a
regular on “Saturday Night Live,”
she developed such characters as
Rhonda Weiss, Lisa Loopner, and
Emily Litella, with‘ a ﬂair for the
realism in people that is often the '
funniest aspect of exaggeration.
Last summer, Radner’s

characters lit the stage of New
York’s Winter Garden. and the

“Live From New York/ Gilda ‘ V

Radner’s characters and /
songwriter-producer Paul Shaffer,
and the resulfis the ﬁnest musical
, comedy in a very long time.

p ‘ ‘Let’s Talk Dirty To The

_ Animals” opens the album with an
immediate kick of humor. It begins
as a sweet little song, reminiscent
of Sesame Street or Mister Rogers '
ditties, then suddenly rises to a
degree of ﬁlth that somehow can
only be kept cute by Radner. In
keeping with the cuteness, she
continues with an audition piece
that includes an’ awkward tap dance
and someawkward jokes. Radner
once againproves that she is at her
best, when she is awkward. She is

of Life” had four goldgsingles on it

with a protest «songagainst the ban

such a superﬁcial character as _g
Rhonda Weiss, however, displays a
sense of sadness, and in that
respect, Radner makes a protest of
her own. i V

’ Lisa Loopher, the nerd, performs S

a most touching version of ‘ ‘The

- Way We" Were, ” complete with an

interlude of whining and
noseblowing. It is unlikely that 
anyone can ever duplicate the vocal

manages to hit most of the notes,
but painfully.

Three of Radner’s most famous
characters, Emily Litella, Candy ‘
Slice, and Roseanne Roseanna-

album, showing no lack in the

— diversity of- Radner’s talents and

roles. But there is a place where
she tones down, just a bit, and \

becomes Gilda Radner. The song,

NELSON: The- ﬁrst review was at the

was a very well-made ﬁlm. They even
called it ‘slick.” They said the acting was
good, the photography, everything. But

—. they really came down on it as exploita-

tion. They came down on me, for the
screenplay, saying that I was pretentious.
I didn’t understand if they were saying I
should have stuck to exploitation, and
made a horror film. But it crushed me.

killed it. -_

came out. He handed us a review,.we
hadn’t even seen it. He said he really
wanted to do business with us, but that
the publicity had messed things up.
SHOWCASE: Bad press.-«

NELSON: Yeah, I rolled around with that
for awhile. They called it exploitation,
and they missed totally whatever else was
going on. Then someone from the
“London Observer” reviewed it, ‘and the

guy really dug it. He reviewed it with I

“Alien” and he liked it just _as much.
Then we took it to the Utah Film Festival,
and it was one of the ﬁve ﬁnalists. The

ﬁnal judges that reviewed it just ﬂat out -
rejected it. They were so turned off by I

the snuff movie scene that they just
rejected it. When the ﬁlm was later
discussed, some people just didn’t want
to talk about it. When the issue was
forced, a lot of them thought that it was
the best made film there, they just didn’t
like the subject matter. I mean, this was
a movie that was meant to pull people into
a story, to talk to people about what I‘ see

in terms of ﬁlm-making and violence. But '

overall, the response’ has been 85%
positive.

SHOWCASE: Do you think that you could
capitalize on the controversy surrounding
it? ‘

NELSON: I don’t know if we could do it or
not, we thought about it. I don’t know
that we know enough, because everything
about this ﬁlm is the ﬁrst time out for us.
Buba, co-producer for
“Effects")

BUBA: The thing we have found out is,
the distribution process is such an

‘expensive proposition that, the budget

ﬁgures of the ﬁlm don’t have thatmuch

inﬂuence on it. It only costs so much, but-

we still have to put a minimum amount of
money in it before we make any money
back, otherwise you just have a film that
doesn’t generate any interest. A lot of
distributors tell us that they’ve got to
make at least 400 prints of the ﬁlm, to get
a national release, and with the rising
cost of publicity, renting theaters’, prints,
you’re talking putting over a millionnfor a
campaign_. '

R ,

SHOWCASE: So, in essence, it’s hard for
young ﬁlmmakers to break in right now‘?

BUBA: Yeah, if we had some recogniz-

able name, as bait. Like, “Halloween”-

had Donald Pleasance. If years from now
Joe Pilato becomes a famous movie actor,
then this film would probably sell without
any problem. But we don’t want to have
to wait for that.

SHOWCASE: But all in all,»you must be

pretty optimistic about image works and
the future?

BUBA: That’s an interesting question.

Yeah, we are, just being here L0nighL.;~'\'§;",,

When you sit in the back row of a theater,
and you see a ﬁlm" up there that you’ve
done, it’s suchja kick. I mean, this is
happening. The closer we get to it, the

p -more we realize how difficult the next

steps are going to be. But we’ve done the
ﬁrst one so...

Daniels and Marshall Tucker. This sellout proves once more that Southern
rock has taken the teenage drug hero role that shot and beer heavymetal bands
I like Deep Purple andBlac_k Sabbath used to‘hold. Second, this was one of the
few times a concert-goer in Pittsburgh could legitimately wonder about their
personal safety as they ventured into this crowd.‘
Clearly, a trend has developed as the 70’s wind down: Southern rock’n’r_oll is

fast becoming Pittsburgh most favorite. But with bands like the Outlaws

. By SAMUEL SCIULLO

Tomorrow’s game between Pitt
and Penn State at Beaver Stadium
is the year's most important tussle
for both teams. The Panthers are
trying to end a string of frustrations
against Joe Paterno, while the Lion

wfmentor would like nothing better

than to humiliate Pitt.

Before .1973, when Johnny
Majors.came to Pitt, Penn State
and Paterno often whipped the

7- Panthers by outrageous scores.

The 1968 game at Pitt Stadium was

/ probably the closest thing to "cruel

and unusual punishment on a
football ﬁeld ever witnessed. The
Lions entered the game undefeated
and ranked among the top three
teams in the country. Pitt, which
was playing its ﬁnal game under
coach Dave Hart, was 1-8.

The Lions’ scored the ﬁrst _10
times they had the ball,and won by
a whopping 65-9 count. Late in the
game, Paterno tried to show some
mercy. With the Lions deep in Pitt
territory, Paterno ordered his
quarterback, Chuck Burkhart, to
roll out -and actually slow down to
let the Pitt defenders catch u_p to
him. But so deﬁcient were the
Panthers that none could catch
Burkhart, who eventually fell to the
ground.

Pitt’s next football coach was
Carl DePasqua, an old Pitt gridder

from the 1940s who liked to wear I

hats adorned with feathers, and
often tried to win the favorsjof
sportswriters with his clever, well-
prepared statements. He, like
Hart, had little success against
Paterno, losingfour games from
1969-1972.

The 1971 game in Pittsburgh was
very interesting. With the Lions
leading 55-6 early in the fourth
quarter, Pitt scored two quick

. . . _; \
‘ r - . ‘ 1 _ '

Panthers to Co

touchdowns to close the gap to a
mere 55-18. At that point, Paterno
shocked everyone by re-inserting
his ﬁrst-team defense "for the rest
of the game.

Rather than admit he,wanted to
make Pitt look bad, or that he
wanted to give his first team more

experience, Paterno stated after
the game that you never can'be
sure about Pitt-Penn State games, ‘
crazy things have been known to
happen, etc. If ever a coach tried to
rub another team’s face in the .dirt,

- so it was in 1971 at Pitt Stadium.

The following year, in De-

Pasqua’s.last game as Pitt’s coach,
the Lions led 49-0 at”the start of the
ﬁnal quarter.

ﬁred following the season, Paterno

may have become the ﬁrst coach in »

history who tried to save another
coach’; job by allowing DePasqua’s

. Because it’ was
‘apparent that DePasqua would be

py ‘The Paterno

Way’?

team to score on his. , .

The Panthers somehow managed
to score four touchdowns in the last
15 minutes, making/the end result
a somewhat respectable 49-27.
Why would Paterno want to save
DePasqua’s job, you ask? Simple.
Paterno knew he‘could always beat
DePasqua, and the life of Joe
Paterno has become substantially
tougher since Majors- and Jackie
Sherrill took over at Pitt.

Despite all his remarks to the
contrary, Paterno despises seeing
Pitt enjoy the success it has in the
last'seven seasons. The ultimate
insult had to be in 1976 when the

Panthers won the national cham- -

pionship, something which has
eluded Paterno often. Despite
three undefeated-squads, none of
Paterno’s teams has been rated No.
1 at theend of the season,

‘something_ which digs at him‘?

constantly. .

In his book, “The Paterno
Way,” Paterno stated that rank-
ings are unimportant. He said if a

team is undefeated at the end of._

the season, then it has accomplish-
ed everything it can, in spite of

‘ V what the rankings might say. But

Paterno sang a different tune last
year, when his team, playing not
only for Penn State,‘ but for" the
“pride of Eastern football,” tried

‘ to win a national championship. He

was adamant in his analysis of the

, rankings last year, and he knew

darn well where his team stood at

‘ all points of the season: —~_, ’

"53

Penn State is 7-3 this year and is‘
not going _to win a national
championship, but a win over the

Panthers would bring them an '

Eastern championship, something
which has gained in importance
recently.

2 Prediction—Pitt 14, Penn State 7‘

Joe Patemo ’s Quarterback Dilemma Apparentlfsolved

STATE COLLEGE, PA—Penn
State coach Joe Paterno apparently
has had his quarterback dilemma

' solved for him, but not the way he

ﬁgured.

Paterno was undecided on which
of his quarterbacks to start
tomorrow against Pitt in the
regular season windup for the two
bowl-bound teams—Dayle Tate or
Frank Rocco.

Tate is the junior who‘ ran the
team until he jammed a thumb two
weeks ago against Temple. Fresh-
man Rocco replaced Tate in the

Temple game and triggered the '
Nittany Lions to a 22-7 triumph. ., ‘

The decisionowas made in a way

"typical of the entire Penn State

season—by an ailment. Rocco
suffered headaches this week, and
was sent to the Hershey Medical
Center for treatment. The setback
apparently has turned Paterno to

Tate as the starter.

There always -is the possibility.

that Rocco will recover sufficiently
to get the nod from his coach, but a
Penn State spokesman said it was
very doubtful. I

This will be the 79th‘ meeting
between these intrastate rivals with
State leading 39-36-3. The Lions
won last year and have walked off
with the game ball in eight of the
last nine years.

But Pitt, ranked 11th, should be
the favorite when the team's kick off
on national television (ABC). The
Panthers are 9-1, and headed for
the Fiesta Bowl game Christmas
Day against a yet unnamed
opponent. Penn State is 7-3 and
rated 19th, with a Dec. 23 date in
the Liberty Bowl versus Tulane,
9-2.

This isn’t, however, a typical
Penn State team. The Lions have

‘the most important

Murphy’s Law (Code 406,
pertaining to Pitt basketball):
Never start a season with an
injury-free lineup, always play your
opening game the same evening as
the Pitt-Penn State football game to
reduce attendance, and most
importantly—-lose at least one
starter for an undetermined period
of time before the opening tipoff.

The Panthers open their 1979-80'

season tomorrow night against
B-jjgknell and with. less than four
days to go, it looked as if Pitt would
escape the implementation of its
own Murphy’s Law.

_ It was_ not to be, however, as
probably starting center Ed

this season and not have to be a
one-man rebounding show. .“‘

Said head coach Tim Grgurich,
"Sammy’s the kind of guy you can
lean on to be a physical leader on
the court.

“But, we are a team, andnot just
one player, as a lot of people would
assume.”

Ellis is a proven scorer who
stepped in right away after trans-
ferring from Middle Georgia Junior
College. He is the only senior in
the starting lineup.

Neverson and Olinger are con-
trasts on offense. The 6-3
Neverson generally maneuvers his
way inside to score and shoot on

the run while Olinger, at 6-5, has a ‘

ﬁne outside shooting touch.
Newcomers include junior col-

lege transfer Lenny McMillan and

freshmen Paul Borozovich, . a

Pitt enters its season opener
against a surprisingly. good Buck-
nell team with a lot of little injuries.
Clancy missed some practice time
with a back problem, guard Duane
Wallace has also been hurt, while
Borozovich recently turned ‘an
ankle.

Bucknell was 18-9 last year, the
best record ever for the school. The
team returns four starters, includ-
ing three players who are four-year
starters. ‘

Offensively, Bucknell’s biggest
threats are Bob Barry and Al
Leslie, both of whom averaged 18.7
points per game in ’79. Barry
became the school's -careerscoring
leader in the ‘final game and has
amassed 1,352 points.

A 6-7“center, Barry averaged 9.2
rebounds. “What he’s done for

I   PantherTalent Should Help\Pitt Prevail Over State Tomorrow

I

On paper, Saturday’s clash between Pitt and Penn

I State should be no contest. Never mind vivhatthet

oddsmakers say, the Panthers are the more talented
squad. - - *

Of course, games are not played -on -paper, so
statistics are not always the telling st-ory in a game.
The fact that this is a great rivalry adds to the dimen-

. layers perform as superstars. ‘ s
It has not been the best of seasons for the Nittany
Lions, as their 7-3 record indicates. A win over Pitt,
however. would make amends for the year.
Although sporting a 9-1 record, the Panthers still
haven’t gained the respect of the pollsters." A win
‘over their arch rivalwould certainly give them the
respect they need and deserve.

Both teams come into the game with good if not _

brilliant defenses and somewhat inconsistent
offenses. A closer look at the matchups is in-order.
The key to the game does not lie in the defense
-because everyone knows -it’s safe to expect another
strong performance. -
