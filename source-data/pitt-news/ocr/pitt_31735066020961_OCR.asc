On- and off-campus housing expensive

By Sandra Kramer
Staff Writer

As the lottery for students seek-
ing campus housing continues,
more and more students are
realizing a need to find an apart-
ment. But the question remains,

' is it cheaper to live on or off

0

campus?

According to Cheryl Buche-
wicz, a representative from Click-
man Real Estate, "lt's definitely
cheaper to live off campus. Not

only does the rent cost about the
same as living in the dorms, you
get the advantage of a bigger
place to live, a kitchen, a living
room and [not having] to share
the bathroom with anyone except
your roommates.”

To get an idea of the cost of
some off-campus apartments,
Buchewicz quoted several prices.

According to Buchewicz, a
three-bedroom apartment for five
people on Ward Street is $900,
which includes everything except

electric. On Oakland Avenue, a
typical two-bedroom apartment
for four people costs $700 plus
gas and electric. A one-bedroom
apartment for two people on
McKee Street costs $420.
David Padawer, a representa-

tive from Daran Management

Co., said that his company rents
most of its apartments to students.

Padawer said that Daran Man-
agement Co. rents efficiency,
one- and two-bedroom apart-
ments.

The efficiency apartments start
at $275 a month. The one-bed-
room apartments start at $350,
and can be rented by one or two
people, and the two-bedroom
apartments start at $415 a month,
Padawer continued.

Padawer also agrees that it is
cheaper to, live off campus.

Leslie Masciola from the Hous-
ing Office said, ”The average rate
per term for dorm residency is

$955."

Big buddies befriend troubled juveniles

By Karen Speece
Staff Writer

Once a week, residents of the
Shuman Juvenile Detention
Center can be assured of a visit
from their "big buddies.”

The collegiate YMCA originat-
ed its Big Buddy program in
1970, and according to Keith

Kondrich, program director of —

collegiate YMCA, it has become
one of the organization's most

R popular programs.

"Big Buddies provide male and
female role models for these
youth. Students volunteer one

hour a week to go play games,
talk with and just be with the
kids,” Kondrich said. "For a lot
of [the kids], we're the only role
model they've got.”

According to engineering stu-
dent Doug Bajack, who coordi-
nated the program for two years,
the Big Buddy program is very
satisfying.

"The kids sometimes don't
show that they're thankful, be-
cause of peer pressure, but once
in a while they'll say something
or you'll see something that has
changed in them that makes it all
worth it," Bajack said.

"We hope that through our
role models, these kids will pur-
sue something other than crime,"
he added.

The Shuman Center is Alleghe-
ny County's holding facility for
juvenile delinquents who are
awaiting trial. Residents are held
at the center for periods of time
ranging from two weeks to six
months.

According to Kondrich, ap-
proximately 50 Pitt students are
volunteers in the Big Buddy
program.

Recruitment for the program
comes at the beginning of each
semester. Volunteers are recruit-
ed through word of mouth, ads in
Pittsburgh publications and in
classes related to this type of
volunteer work, such as criminal
and social psychology, Kondrich
said.

"We ask for one hour a week,
and commitment for the entire
semester from our volunteers, be-
cause the kids start to expect the
students to come and are disap-
pointed if they don't come," Kon-
drich said.

Trustees
plan
campus
renovaﬂon

By Michelle L. O'Brien

Senior Staff Writer

Allegheny County commission-
ers have approved Pitt's proposal
for a 950-car garage to be built
underneath the lawn of Soldiers
and Sailors Memorial, reported

' university President Wesley Pos-

var yesterday.

Pitt will pay the county
$250,000 annually to lease the
garage and will pay‘a portion of
the $16.8 million construction
cost, Posvar said.

These announcements were
made by Posvar at the Pitt Board
of Trustees winter meeting.

Construction is also scheduled
to begin on a building to house
Pitt's Center for Biotechnology

and Bioengineering in late spring, -

according to Posvar.

He also noted that the univer-
sity is considering many other
construction and renovation
projects to increase the availabil-
ity of on-campus housing and
campus "green space.” These
beautiﬁcation projects may some-
day include the redesign of
Schenley Plaza outside of Forbes
Quadrangle and the closings of
some Oakland streets, he said.

"We're going to see a whole
new face on this campus in the
next five to 10 years," said
Posvar.

Pennsylvania Governor Robert
Casey was praised at the Board of
Trustees meeting for his 1989-90
budget proposal. Posvar said
Casey's proposal, which includes
a 7 percent increase in funding
for all state-supported schools,
represents the state's "positive
new commitment to education."

Casey's proposal also calls for
a decrease in state funding for pri-
vate schools.

The state budget is scheduled
to be finalized by mid-March.

In other business, the Board ap-
proved several administrative
changes in Pitt's Medical and
Health Care Division, including
the transfer of administrative
responsibility for Falk Clinic from
MHCD to Presbyterian-Univer-
sity Hospital.

Board Chairman John Marous
said the transfer is necessary be-

. cause the Clinic's primary role is

outpatient care of P_resby patients.

Marous said the transfer will
also increase the number of pa-
tients whose medical bills are
paid by third Darties.

Bush defense appointee und

WASHINGTON (AP) —~ Presi-
dent Bush said Wednesday he
has seen no evidence that would
cause him to lose confidence in
Defense Secretary-designate John
Tower, whose Senate confirma-
tion vote has been delayed for at
least 10 days.

Senior Democrats on the
Armed Services Committee said
earlier that the FBI was reviewing
allegations about the former
Texas senator's finances.

”Have I seen anything, or has
anything in the FBI report made
me want to change my mind as
one who would be concerned
about insobriety or about failure
to be ready for duty 24 hours a

' day? The answer is no, I have

not,” Bush said.

”If somebody else sees the evi-
dence that they want to interpret
differently, that's not only their
right but their obligation,” he

said. '

Bush said he was not criticiz-
ing the investigation process but
was upset that unsubstantiated
rumors were being circulated and
were hurting Tower.

Bush was asked to explain how
some senators reviewing the
same material he has seen have
expressed reservations about the
nomination.

”Then my appeal would be, if
you've made up your mind, let
the process go forward. Let's have
the vote... they have an obliga-
tion to vote their conscience,”
Bush said.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, February 9, W89

Counseling alleviates stresses of being a Pitt senior

By Michele Quinn
The Pitt News

Elizabeth (not her real name),
wearing a new gray business suit,
slowly walked out of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh's Career Serv-
ices Center. Earlier, before her
first job interview, she had
looked confident, but now
Elizabeth looked depressed, and
as she waited for the elevator her
padded shoulders slumped.

’/That did not go well at all,”
she said helplessly. ”What am I
going to do when I graduate?
Where am I going to work?
Where am I going to live?”

Elizabeth is just one of many
seniors graduating from the
University of Pittsburgh this year
andentering the job market. She
is also one of many students ex-
periencing confusion about what
she wants to do after April 30 -

graduation day.

In response to this distress, the
University of Pittsburgh Counsel-
ing and Student Development
Center is expanding its group
counseling program to provide a
group just for college seniors.

”This group will give seniors a
sense of how others are making
decisions and reacting to differ-
ent experiences like their first job
interview,” said Rita Drapkin, a
counselor at the center.

The Senior Support Group will
specifically discuss the many
transitions related to leaving col-
lege. Some of these problems in-
clude the ways students deal with
leaving the security of college
and how they react to the stress
involved with loans, job hunting
and graduate school, Drapkin
said.

A student may have a common
problem, but might not know

other students who share that
problem or how to find them.

”Sometimes it helps decrease
the isolation for students to know
that their peers feel confused
too,” Drapkin said.

Drapkin said the idea for the
Senior Support Group came from
a nurse at the University of Pitts-
burgh Health Services who had

noticed many seniors complain-

ing of depression.
”We know people are out
there that need this support

_group, but we think they don't

really know we offer these serv-
ices,” Drapkin said.

The Senior Support Group is
included in the“University Coun-
seling Center's winter groups and
workshops. These discussion
groups have run for 15 years, in
response to students’ needs.

”These groups are developed
for people who just need to talk

about their problems and maybe
learn about how others deal with
problems, " Drapkin said.

”The group gatherings are
almost like being with friends be-
cause you know where the stu-
dents are coming from through
the discussions,” she added. ”But
the students in these groups also
benefit from a professional’s ex-
perience and advice.”

There is a combination of a
Counselor's speaking about
specific topics and the students in
the group participating, Drapkin
said.

Some groups are more struc-
tured than others. In the ”Stress
Management” group, students
receive coaching and practice in
relaxation techniques in order to
manage the emotional and phys-
ical effects of stress.

In another group, ”Shyness,”
students who consider them-

selves shy work in a less struc-
tured group to overcome social
anxiety and to improve interper-
sonal skills.

”During the group sessions,
people develop a certain amount

of trust. Then they realize they are" e

not that different from each other,
and it becomes easier to talk

about problems,” Drapkin said. ‘

’’I enjoyed the informal and
friendly atmosphere along with
the interactions of the group,”
one student of last semester's
”Shyness” group said.

”As a therapy session con-
tinues, there is a bond of caring
that develops between the wom-
en in the group,” said a student
in the ”Women’s |ssues” group,

a session for women which start- -9

ed last semester. ‘
Most groups will begin during
the month of February. Before

Dental clinic offers affordable care Housing

By Mike Hudson
Staff Writer

For those students who can't
find the time to visit the family
dentist, Pitt's dental clinic offers
convenient dental care at a price
even students can afford.

According to Dr. Robert D.
Mundell, associate dean of the
School of Dental Medicine, the
clinic, which is run by Pitt's den-
tal school, offers complete den-
tal care for its patients while
providing dental students the op-
portunity to practice treatment
procedures which correlate to
their capabilities.

Mundell said dental students,
hygiene students and graduate
residents work under the super-
vision of faculty members while
performing assigned treatment
procedures to clinic patients.

The clinical experience com-
bines practical application of
learned techniques with patient
interaction in order to prepare the
students for professional careers
in the various fields of dentistry.

The clinic runs in conjunction
with the four-year training pro-
gram for the dental students.

According to Mundell, many
Pitt students do not use the serv-
ices available. He attributes this

to the fact that most students are
not aware that the dental clinic
exists.

He urges students to come to
the clinic and take advantage of
the services.

Mundell emphasized the fact
that the school makes adjust-
ments in terms of reducing fees
and extending payments in ord-
er to accommodate a patient’s
financial situation.

”For students of the university,
we have always bent over back-
wards [to] try to make sure we
give them every. break financial-

ly, because we know they're un-

She commented, ’’I don't know
if it's cheaper to live on or off
campus. I never researched that.
i only know about the cost of
Pitt's residence halls.”

Since many students are now
making plans for next term’s liv-
ing arrangements, advertisements

Estate advertises that it rents effi-
ciency, one-, two-, three- and
four-bedroom apartments with
prices ranging from $330 to $660
a month.

in the final analysis, the relative
costs for both on- and off-campus
housing make the answer to the

housing dilemma dependent_

upon the needs of each individu-
al student.

A tuition challenge
Pitt shouldn't refuse

It appears that Pitt finally has a tangible reason to
control the steady rise of tuition.

Black — it's not just another color

' Dear Betty and Wilma, ’’I can't believe I put up with The demographics of the

In addition to an increase of 7 percent in state ap-
propriations to Pitt, Gov. Casey proposed on Tues-
day to provide state-related schools with an extra
$100 for every full-time student on the condition that
the university limits annual tution hikes to $100 or
less. The program is called Tuition Challenge Grants

and it offers Pitt an opportunity to assist students who.

want to purchase a formal education. It is questiona-

ble, however, whether Pitt actually cares about its’

students. -
Over the last decade, Pitt's tuition has increased
an average of 10 percent per year_. This year, it re-
quested_ an 18 percent increase injstate funds toVrnain-
tain tuition at the present level and provide faculty
with a 7.5 percent pay hike. In other words, Pitt hopes
to counteract faculty pay hikes with state money. Un-
fortunately for Pitt students, the state doesn't have the
money to fuel such reasoning. ’ ,
Since the state won't provide Pitt faculty with more
money, Pitt students will have to do it. This can be

especially difficult when Pitt offers a professor, such".

as former Pa. House speaker K. Leroy lrvis, $60,000
to teach. . ”
Gov. Casey's Tuition Challange Grants gives Pitt

something it can finally relate.to: money. Perhaps I

with this incentive, Pitt will strive a little harder to
stabilize the cost ofeducation. It is unfortunate,
though, that the needs of the students were not ade-

P-nothingl. to do with what:~:rea'IIy

I'm not surethat thereisone

the question is: ”Why is this an
option?”

In response to your Something

V Loud [Feb. 2] article on people

dressed in black, may_I offer a bit
of insight from the people you
neglected to interview: I don't
wear black because it's ’’cool,’’
or because it's ”evil,” or because
I'm supposed to be chronically
depressed. I don't think that just
because I wear black you can
clump me together with ’’people
who are attempting to conform to
one another.” I think |’m_a pretty
unique person, and clothes have

black is a more mysterious and
mature color than, perhaps, lime

is; no big revelation, is it? [...]

Putting up with racism.

Last term, I was a teaching as-

. sistant in a CAS course. I have just

received the anonymous evalua-
tions of my teaching from the stu-
dents I taught. The evaluations
contained some praise and some
helpful criticism, along with the
following comment:

 is in the Officer's Training Pro-

gram of the Marines. For him,
too, it was an option that he knew
was-always lurking in his psyche.
These two were perfect candi-
dates for me to talk to honestly
and openly. ‘

Both of them were more than
willing to sit down and discuss

V the benefits of being involved
with the military, and we talked ~

for more than an hour-and-a-half.

Conviction was the major in-
gredient in their beliefs, convic-
tion and a strong sense of unity_
with those who held views simi-
lar to their own.

Phil stated his commitment
perfectly when he said that the
military was not a job, but a ’’call-
ing — once it becomes a conven-
tional job and not a calling, then
you know it’sstime to get out.”

”Is there really a need for the
military today?” I’ asked.-~Da'vid
responded with an enthusiastic
yes-. . "N

-Taking the easy way out?

Mr. Kengor [The Pitt News,
Feb. 6] thinks the easiest solution
for the problem of homelessness
.is ”for them all to simply get up
and find a job.” He obviously has
not seen statistics from the U.S.
Conference of Mayors stating that

' nearly one-quarter of the home-

less do have jobs. A low mini-

mum wage that has not increased ‘

nationwide in the last eight years
has left many people without
enough buying power to afford
housing.  ‘ '

Understanding militarymen in an everyd

’/I'm proud to join and carry on
the tradition,” said David. ‘'50

many others have sacrificed their

lives so that we could live in free-
dom. I'm honored to serve.”

Both of them were religious,
quoting passages from the Bible.
”To serve God and your country”
seemed to be a motto shared by
both men.

We then approached the sub-
ject of political dissenters and
”liberals.” Phil said, ”When peo-
ple tell me I'm a baby killer, I sim-
ply tell them that I'm protecting
their rights to say things like that.
I protect their right to disagree
publicly with the administratilgp
and their right to live in freedom.
I'm not a baby killer.”

Neither one believed in abor-
tion and both were happy with
the current administration. These

viewslare echoed by many who _ V

are in themilitaryu .

  

rﬁr

  

homeless have also changed 7

since the 19705. This population

now consists largely of homeless f
families (estimated to comprise f

76 percent of the homeless in
New York City), the mentally ill,

Vietnam veterans and those with "
chemical dependencies. I think ' '

that these factors must be consi-

dered before we try to simplify A’

the problem by stating ”get a

‘SHOWCASE  

February 9, 1989

By Jim Tezak

and Jessica Coville
Staff Writers

From the moment movie direc-
tor Spike Lee entered the room,
it was plainly obvious that he was
different from the members of
Hollywood’s so-called ”Black
Pack/’ .

Here was no Eddie Murphy or
6 Arsenio Hall or Run—DMC. There

was none of the gaudy gold
jewelry or flashy clothes. Lee
wore a black hat and a gray hood-
ed sweatshirt with ”New York”
and the number ”33” embla-
zoned on the front.

’’I feel my role is to make films
that black audiences will respond
to. That’s my purpose,” Lee said.

_ ’’I don't want to make Stephen
Spielberg types of films. I can't do
that better than him. I'm not in-
terested in that.”

Lee's films include She's Got-
ta Have It and School Daze. He
has a new film due out soon en-
titled Do The Right Thing. Ac-
cording to Lee, the movie is a
humorous drama about the youth

 of New York City.

At a press conference in the
William Pitt Union, Lee saidthat.
the main reason he differs from
other black directors, such as Ed-
die Murphy, Arsenio Hall, Robert
,Townsend and Keenan lvery
Wayans (who are known as
Hollywood's ”Black' Pack”), is
that they only do comedy.

4 Lee contends that his films,
qr while humorous, present serious

~ social issues that need to be ad-

dressed by the black people in to-
day's society.

While today's Hollywood
seems interested only in making
blockbuster movies that win‘
awards and gross millions at the
box office, Lee feels that this is
not the major goal of most movie
directors. He said that the success
and money come ”as the residue
of the work we do.”

Lee said that the reason more
serious films about blacks aren't
a being produced is that black
’ directors are not. at the same lev-
el as white ones, especially finan-
cially. Lee does not see that .
Changing ln the future’ V ' T Viet Phom/The Pitt News

But, ”The more films we make, ‘ .
the better films we're going to
get,” he said. _ _  . _ . a. .3 -

According to Lee, Hollywood  , ‘ .  . 
movies made -to depict the strug- ' _ \ ' ’ ‘
gles of blacks against racism are . — -
inaccurate. One example he cit- '

3' ed is the recently released Missis- - . ‘S
‘ sippi Burning, which he said was - '
well-made but a total lie.

”The black people are way in 2
the background of Mississippi

A Burning; I hate that movie.”

Lee said he has also encoun-
tered racism in Hollywood,
although movie companies try to
disguise it. He said that it was
most obvious in the release of his
last movie, School Daze.

Columbia Pictures, the studio ~ ~
that produced. the movie, gave

him little support in marketing
the movie, Lee said. He had to

9 print up his own posters, and

there were no television com-
mericials to help advertise the
film.

In addition, when the
producers found out that School
Daze was scheduled to open the
same day as Action Jackson and
another movie, they tried to get
him to change the date.

”They thought School Daze

would be closed after the first
week, and that's what they hoped
for,” Lee said. ”They put it out
with as little support as possible,
hoping it would go bust and then
they would be rid of us.”

The movie grossed over $2 mil-
lion in its first weekend.

Does Lee think the success of
School Daze will help him get
more advertising support for his

’ new film when it is released? He

hinted that he did not, saying
Hollywood was treating him like
his success was a fluke.

’’I would say they really don't
know what to do with us,” Lee

said.

Later, playing to _a sold out
crowd, Spike Lee appeared to
promote his latest movie Do the
Right Thing.

In an open dialogue format,
Mr. Lee answered questions rang-
ing from Greek racism to racial
concerns of the Afro—American.

At times, the talk became a
shouting match in the audience
between those who belonged to
Greek organizations and those
who didn't.

In response to a question about
Mr. Lee ever belonging to a frater-
nity he said,”l never pledged a
frat while in college...and I be-

lieve that what was portrayed on
the screen was the truth,” speak-
ing of his controversial film
School Daze.

Lee's film Do the Right Thing,
which will be released in July, is
film based on the Howard Beach
incidents that took place recent-
ly in New York.

To a question about the serious
nature of his films, .Mr. Lee
said,”My films are serious, what
is up there happened...that’s the
image I saw.” .

One of Mr. Lee's main points
of the evening was, ”we (the
Afro-Americans) need to become
obsessed as a people. We can do

anything we want because we're
a minority. There are 25 million
of us out of 200 million Ameri-
cans and we need to do the best
work we can.”

In response to the newly
released Mississippi Burning, Lee
said, ”We need to tell our own
stories and make our own films.
It [the movie] didn't even include
the black man, it showed us be-
ing saved by the wonderful FBI.”

At the end of the question and
answer period, Mr. Lee was
presented with a plaque to com-
memerate his achievements in
film making and to honor his'up—
coming film Do the Right Thing.

couch in his full—size tour bus
with an edgy arrogance that says,
’’I never once compromised to
get where I am.”

He seems very tranquil and
composed as he speaks, a stark
contrast to the seething fury he
and the other members of Dan-

zig (Eerie Von, John Christ and

Chuck Biscuits) unleash on stage. ‘

They play with a power and in-
tensity that few bands will ever
achieve.

Danzig was formed to carry on
Glenn's personal, as well as mus-
ical, perceptions. Just as Samhain
had been nurtured from the Mis-
fits, Danzig is an improved, ma-
tured offspring of Samhain. ”lt’s
just an evolutionary process,”
says Glenn.

The songs" on the band's first,
self-titled LP, Danzig, are over-
flowing with severity and aggres-
sion, the qualities that have
brought Glenn a cult following as
the icon of brutality. He is quick
to note that these themes are per-
sonal visions, not influenced by;
or meant to negatively influence
others. ‘

”You’re trying to tie me to vio-
lence that other people are do-
ing,” Glenn says defensively.
”What other people do doesn't
reflect on my music. If some kid
goes and hangs himself, that has
nothing to do with my music.”

Danzig’s songs are forging into
a new realm of musical existence,
creating a niche in a business al-
ready filled with a tumult of
categories. ’’I don't classify it,”
says Glenn. ”lt’s loud, it's violent
and it's aggressive. It's whatever
it is.”

Along with the Danzig LP,
there was to be a 12" EP released
in Europe. It contains material not
found on the album, including a
cover of Elvis’ ”Trouble,” which
Danzig used as an encore wrap-
up for last Wednesday's show.

”That will be released soon,”
says Glenn. ’’I wanted to release
it here, but Geffen’s not into
releasing‘ 12" EPs. Overseas
there's a bigger market, so they'd
rather release it overseas and then
import it here.”

Most of Glenn's previous
works were produced and
released through Plan 9, a label
he started and ran himself. Dan-
zig was released on Def Ameri-
can Records with Rick Rubin —
renowned for his work with the.
Beastie Boys, Slayer and The Cult
— manning the production.

”[Rick] came down to a show
that we did, a New Music Semi-
nar show. He wanted to sign us.
At the time, we were talking to
labels. Eerie and I wanted to sign
to a different label than Plan 9.
We wanted to get the next step.
Plan 9 was good for what we
were doing at the time, but we
wanted to go farther. _

”So, after talking to a bunch of
labels, we decided to go with
Rick because he's a great guy, a
great producer; and he runs his
own recordcompany. It was the
best deal.”

Although Glenn opposes dis- -

‘cussing his past musical’en-
deavors, fans will be glad to

sonal well-being ranks high.
While never one to act malicious-
ly, he will not tolerate attacks
directed toward him. The en-
vironment around him is some-
thing he reacts to, but shows little
respect or caring for.

”The world doesn't mean sh—t
to me,” says Glenn. ”I don't give
two f—cks about the world. I don't
really care. [laughs]

”As far as a philosophy on life,
I don't know if I have [one] that
I think other people should listen
to. I have what I believe in, which
is kind of personal. There are so
many things I believe in! Just do
what you wanna do and make
sure you don't f—ck anybody else
up, unless they're trying to f-ck
you up first. The strong survive!”

The future for Danzig, as a
band, certainly holds more tour-
ing and records, but there _are also
Glenn's own directives. Many in-
volve the band, but just as many
don't. He is always striving to
keep his mind and body (He still

works out when he has time.) in 4»
the best condition possible. Once

Glenn conquers an objective, he
prepares to take on another.

”Things change all the time,”
he says. ”Once you do some-
thing, you want to move on.
There are ultimately goals that -I
have, but they're all different.
There's just tons of things I'd like
to do and I can't. Unfortunately,
I don't have the time to sithere
and tell you all these things. It‘
would take hours!”

Interview
with closet artist

Kirk Botula

Kirk Z. Botula: Well, I went
into painting because when I was
young, I spent some time in Eu-
rope, in Austria, and I met a
painter there. I had been staying
at an inn, in Klgenfurt, and I had
not heard an English word in
three months. And a woman who
ran the inn ran down to this little
lake near the inn where I was sit-
ting one afternoon, and she

calledto me frantically, saying
”Come back to the house!”
So I headed back, and there

was a car pulled up and there was ’

a man standing there with an
easel set up, and he was painting.
And I walked up to him and he
called out ”He|lo!” in English,
and I talked with him.

Iish was like drinking it in, I .

hadn't heard it in so long. And so
we talked for a long time, and he
told me how he had gone to art
school and’ decided after he
graduated from art school he
wanted to see Europe for a while.

For like six months, he was just
going to travel around _and paint,
to try and make his living, and
then he'd get on with his life.
Well, he'd been doing it for 15
years when I'd met him. And I
said to myself I really envied his
life.

Betty: How old were you at the
time?

KZB: Seventeen, I guess. I
turned 17 that summer. And I
said that's what I would love —
that ability, that freedom to pick
up and go at any time. I envied
that, and I decided that's what I
was going to do, I was going to

I go to art school and be an artist.

W: Has the drum always been

a theme in your artwork?
"KZB: The first time I did the
drum was for our first show at the
Electric Banana, when we.
opened for The Shunts in 1985.
I've always been interested in
propaganda, the art of ideology.
And I will take imagery from the
socialist realists in Russia, and the
Nazis, and the fascists in Italy,
and the American war—time

iposters. You know, these ‘very

  

.\_

idealized figures — a lot of ban-
ners, heroic farmers, boy—meets-
tractor sort of thing. The drum
was used in the first poster. There
was a drum and a wreath.

W: The wreath being
Christmas?

KZB: No, it was a victory

B: When did you first start
working with woodcuts as a
medium?

KZB: I worked with a guy
named Bruce Carter, who is a
woodcut artist in Pittsburgh, and
I first started with him. And then
I started doing linoleum rather
than wood, which would have
been an anathema to Bruce. To
him that was just not the real
stuff. But it was a lot faster, and
I would just crank them out-

I always liked them because

.. ‘/)0,

BETTY
&
WILMA

they were used a lot in revolu-
tionary artwork. Like the Mexi-
cans had a long history of
revolutionary woodcuts, and the
Soviets did, too. Especially in the
'20s, that was a big medium.

It was something that was very
strident about a woodcut that I
liked, and it was used a lot in
making posters and things like
that which could be mass-
produced. But there was a
uniqueness about it that made it
different from just regular print-

ing thatl liked.
W: Do you prefer woodcuts to
painting?

KZB: That's a hard question. I
do like woodcuts sort of on a
principle. I like prints better than

 

a painting —— although I love to
paint. Painting is fun. A woodcut
is a little closer to a democratic
art, whereas painting tends to be
less democratic.

B: Has your music influenced
your artistic ability?

KZB: Well, I quit painting.

B: Why?

KZB: Because I'm more in-
terested in rock ’n’ roll. Art in-
fluenced me out of art and into
music because I was really in-
terested in propaganda as well as
democratic art; and I found more
and more that art in our age has
no resonance in our culture.

W: Why?

KZB: Painting has become like
making buggywhips. We don't
need buggywhips anymore, we
have cars. But some people still
make them because they love the
craft. And rich people still buy
them. It's just like painting —
there's a certain status and
elitism. I'm sure there are bug-
gywhip journals and buggywhip
critics and buggywhip exhibi-
tions, and that's just like painting.

Now I'm going to catch a lot of
hell from my friends that are
painters, and that's what it was

like when I quit painting, it was-

sort of like I left the church. They
really saw me as, like, betraying
the true faith. But music! And not
like what is considered high-art
music, but pop music, rock ’n’
roll. .

Journalism, television and pop

Painting is a wonderful thing to

do, but if you have anything that
you want to say to our culture,
that's not the medium. Painting
has a lot of merit, and I have to
say this as a disclaimer, but rock
’n’ roll has so much more im-
mediacy, so much more reso-
nance in our culture, both in

recorded form and in a live

concert.

W: Concerning your shirts that
you wear that say ”Support

that wearable art?

‘Thursday, February 9, I989

By Vince Carey

Sports Editor

Many college football play-
ers are geared toward one
thing — making it to the pro
level. For some, that dream
can become a reality. For
C many others, they find out
—  they just aren't good enough.

The process these players go
through once they reach their
senior year is long and tiring.

. They play an entire season
(barring injury), then go
through different All—Star
games and finally reach the
combines (a workout monitor-
ed by just about every NFL
club). '

In these combines, a player

25 is put through a comprehen-

sive physical, timed in such
events as the 40-yard dash and
basically put under a
microscope.

Several Pitt players are head-
L ing to these combines (the first

took place from Jan. 31 —— Feb.
4). They are offensive linemen
Mark Stepnoski and Tom Rick-
etts, defensive end Burt Gross-
man, defensive back Troy
Washington and wide receiver
Billy Osborn (worth noting is
that linebacker Jerry Olsavsky,
the team leader in tackles this
season, was not invited).

"I am ready to go,” Osborn
said. ”This is a big thing in my
life. This is a big privilege.
There is_ some pressure in-
volved, but that comes with
the game. If you can't handle
the pressure, well, then maybe
the game isn't for you.”

Osborn has been a key play-
er in the Panther offense over
the last three years and just this
past season moved up to third
on the all-time Pitt receiving
list. Yet, his NFL chances were
jeopardized when he broke
his collarbone against N.C.
State late in the season.

"I do have a disadvantage

Osborn taking the pro route

going into the combines be-
cause of my shoulder,” Os-
born said. "It has been slow in
healing, and while it still is
healing, I won't be able to do
much this weekend except a
little running and the
physicals.”

The physicalscould be a do-
or—die situation for Osborn.
Many scouts believe that if he
is healthy, Osborn could be a
good pro player. But with an
injured arm, he is a liability.

'’If the scouts see that the
arm could hamper me, they
might not be too interested,”
Osborn said. "The good thing
about Pitt, though, is that be-
cause of the name, the scouts
stay with you. On any given
day, somebody could come in
to look at you. You always
have to be ready, and that will
give me enough time to let the
shoulder heal.”

Another disadvantage for
Osborn is that he has not real-

‘tors say myshoulder is,” Os-

ly been timed in the running
events, due to the fact that he
has played baseball every
spring. That kept him away
from all the tests performed on
football players.

"It is going to be an uphill
battle for me, without a
doubt,” Osborn said. "The
bottom line is how I perform
in camp. I think that I can sur-
prise a lot of people with my
speed.”

Will he play baseball this
year?

"It depends on how the doc-

born said. ''If I'm not 100
percent by the time the season
rolls along, I won't plav it
would be cheating the team
and cheating the other players
who are healthy. If I can’t'play
up to my potential, then I
won't play.

sion for me, because I love the

”Jamal is as versatile as they

recruits

By Alan Robinson
AP Sports Writer

(AP) — The University of Pitts-

burgh completed its third con—_

secutive outstanding recruiting
class under Coach Mike Gottfried
by signing 26 players Wednes-
day, including star defensive line-
man Sean Gilbert and two other
prep All-Americans.

The 6-foot-6, 280-pound Gil-
bert, from Aliquippa, made every
recognized All-American team
and was USA Today's defensive
player of the year. He joins a Pitt
defense that already includes
tackle Marc Spindler, USA To-
day's 1986 player of the year,

and linebacker Curtis Bray, the _

1987 national prep coaches play-
er of the year. ‘
"|’ve never seen anything like

him,” Aliquippa Coach Don Yan- '

nessa said of Gilbert, who led the
Quips to a 14-1 record. "He not
only has physical size and defen-
sive ability, he also works hard."

"I’m not going to go in there
with the attitude I can change the
world for them,” said Gilbert, the
AP all-state defensive captain.

”My only goals for now are to be 

the best I can be.” ‘

Recruiting coordinator Bud,“

Ratliff said Gilbert, defensive end

end Burt Grossmanand lineback-
er Jerry Olsavsky. 

”Sean and Keith are two of the "

best players in the country at their:  

positions,” Ratliff said. "And the. « I

son because of NCAA Proposi-
tion 48.

The Panthers signed Harper
and running back Danny Boyd of
Norristown last season, but Boyd
wound up at Riverside (Calif.)
Junior College after failing to
meet Proposition 48 re-
quirements.

Pitt, left without a proven back-
up quarterback when Larry
Wanke transferred to John Car-
roll, signed JUCO quarterback
Scott Stark of Mission Viejo, Calif.
and prep stars Gary Clayton of
Birmingham, Ala., and Mike He-
berle of Erie.

The Panthers also filled a gap
at punter by signing Brian Green-
field, who averaged 47.5 yards
per punt at Glendale (Ca|if.)
Junior College and had 15 punts
of 51 ‘yards or longer."

”He should step in right away
with the punting,” Ratliff said.

Pitt was left without an ex-
perienced punter last season
when John Rasp unexpectedly
left the team during preseason
training camp. The Panthers tried
three punters before" backup
quarterback Yusef Washington fi-
nally won the job.

Gottfried’s staff added five run-
ning backs -— Boyd, Bundy and

prep seniors Vernon Lewis of
Houston, Jermaine Williams of
Detroit and Kevin Williams of
Galveston, Texas —— to go with
Curvin Richards, the top NCAA
Division l-A freshman rusher last
season.

Jermaine Williams rushed for
2,500 yards in his final two sea-
sons and has a 4.4 speed in the
40-yard dash.

Other Pitt junior college
recruits are defensive linemen Jon
Baker of San Rafael, Calif., and
Mark Gunn of Cleveland, defen-
sive back Mark McMil|an of Los
Angeles and tight end Lionel
Sykes of St. Louis.

The freshman class includes
four wide receivers — Bobby
Boykin of Dayton, Ohio; Junior
Green of Hialeah, F|a.; Olanda
Truitt of Birmingham; and War-
ren Ware of Orlando, Fla. —— and
linemen Mike Clever of Young-
stown, Bob Dunwiddie of Massi|-
lon, Ohio, Mike Kelly of
Philadelphia and Lamont Liggett
of Ambridge. A

Liggett is the son of former

Nebraska lineman Bob Liggett. A

Gooden
signs

By Ronald Blum

AP Sports Writer

NEW YORK — Dwight

Gooden became the highest-

paid player in baseball this
year and the highest-paid play-
er in the history of the New
York Mets when he agreed
Wednesday to a three-year
contract worth $6.7 million.
Gooden, who made $1.4
million in 1988 after losing in
arbitration, will get a
$500,000 signing bonus,
$2.25 million this year, $1.7
million in 1990 and $2.25 mil-
lion in 1991, a source familiar
with the negotiation told The
Associated Press. ‘

Van Slyke’s concern
still lockout clause

PITTSBURGH (AP) — Pitts-
burgh Pirates General Manager
Larry Doughty said Wednesday
there is little chance All-Star out-
fielder Andy Van Slyke will sign
a new contract before his Feb. 20
arbitration hearing.

Van Slyke has said there is a
"50-50 chance" he won't return
to the team in 1990 if he goes to
arbitration.

Left—handed pitcher Bob Kipper
signed a one-year contract Tues-
day, leaving Van Slyke as the
only unsigned Pirate eligible for
arbitration.

The Pirates have met Van
Slyke’s demand for a three-year,
$5.5 million contract, but the two
sides disagree over a lockout
clause. With the possibility of an

owners’ lockout in the spring of
1990, ownership is trying to get
players to agree not to be paid if
the lockout is caused by the
threat of a strike.

Van Slyke has refused to sign
a lockout clause.

”What makes it tough is that
this is over principle,” Doughty
said. ’’It would be easier to deal
with if it were over something
else.”

Doughty is unhappy that the
site for Van Slyke’s hearing has
been moved from New York to

Tampa. Van Slyke’s agent, Dick‘:

Moss, ”will be able to parade
some players through as wit-
nesses.”

Student game enthusiasts will
represent Pitt at the Association
of College Unions-International
regional tournaments to be held
at George Washington Universi-
ty Feb. 24-26. ,

The Pitt Program Council spon-
sors ACU-I tournaments in back-
gammon, bowling, chess, college
bowl, eight—ball and table tennis
each year between October and
February.

The winners of these tourna-
ments get an all-expense paid trip
to GWU, courtesy of the PPC, to
represent Pitt at the Region IV
tournament in their particular
event. Region IV consists of

ginia, Ohio and Washington,

The winners of the regional
tournaments then move on to na-
tionals. The national tournaments
are held separately at various lo-
cations across the country.

According to Denise Orwig,
the chairwoman of the PPC
Recreation Committee, Pitt stu-
dents usually do well at the
regional tournaments.

”We have one of the highest-
ranking pool clubs,” Orvvig said.

He added that Pitt student J.R.
Calvert went to the national com-
petition last year to play eight-ball
pool.

Pitt students also placed first in
chess, second in table tennis and
third in bowling at last year's
regionals.

sessions, they meet with the
group leader and discuss why
they feel the group could help
them.

”We interview the students in-
dividually, just to see if it is a

good match between that student

and the group,” Drapkin said.
”Sometimes, a person is going

through a time that is too tough

to talk about in a group. A par-

Clinic

ent or grandparent may have died Q

recently,” Drapkin continued.

. ”At these times, the students may

need to talk to someone on a
one—to-one level.

”Sometimes students feel con-
fused or uncertain, and they need
someone to give them en-
couragement,” Drapkin said.
”That is why the Unversity Coun-
seling Center is here.”

He also added that the school
is willing to work with student

courage students to use the clinic.
