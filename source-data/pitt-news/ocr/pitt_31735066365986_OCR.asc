Before Senate Committee

Posvar

by MIKE MILLER
The Pennsylvania State Senate

” Appropriations Committee heard‘

the University’s budget presenta-
tion last week. Senator Benjamin
R. Donolow, committee chairman,

"told University officials that his
. /committee would vote for cuts in

the budget unless budget in-
creases could be justified to his
constituents.

Donlow felt that the University
had not complied with all of the
suggestions of a Governor’s task
force which studied methods of
increasing efficiency at various

' schools.

. Chancellor Wesley Posvar call-
ed the task force report a “buck-
shot investigation which may be
incorrect in part.” He emphasized
the value of the study and stress-
ed that the University had point-
ed out many problem areas to the
task force.

 Posvar felt that the task force

had been incorrect. in some of its
recommendations. Regarding
some areas in which the task
force recommended cuts, he said,
“We definitely disagree with the
task force here."

Senator Wade asked, “How do ,

we explain this to the tax payers?”
Senator Bell stated that the task

gﬂorce report had been published

in newspapers throughout .the
state and that this would force leg-
islators to account to their con-
stituents if they fail to comply
with the suggestions of the report.

“We ‘won’t vote for an increase
unless there is a report from the
Governor that they (the task
force) have been wrong. Other-
wise we must go along with the
cut," Senator Donolow concluded.

In his presentation of‘ what was
termed a "catch up budget," the
Chancellor emphasized the one
million dollar deficit which Pitt
incurred as interest on loans
taken out when the State failed to
fund the University on time in the
spring of 1971.

He stated that the University
needed money for “catch up re-
quirements and holding our own
requirements.”

Posvar’ said ‘that federal aid and
tuition were stable and that the

. University was suffering from in-

flation, especially in the area of
salaries.

The Chancellor stressed certain
mandated increases, including the
additions to the computer center.

He explained the need for funds
for defered programs such as
$700,000 to imporve security,
$900,000 for repairs, and $175,-

Domestic Affairs Writer Speaks

CGOP Campaigns for Youth Vote

by MARY LOU MURPHY
“President Nixon has respond-

gged’ to the concerns of America’s

youth, but his efforts have receiv-
ed little attention,” according to

J. Brian Smith.

Smith, 22, chief writer for

I Domestic Affairs for the Republi-

can National Committee, visited
~ political science and speech class-
‘es attempting, as he put _it. “to

talk with the students, not to

them.”

 ‘Noting that youth is concerned
'  with national priorities, Smith re-

‘ vealed that 45 per cent of the 1969
federal budget went to defense
while 32 per cent went to human
needs. The present budget re-
verses the order, claiming 32 per
cent for defense and 45 per cent
gr human needs.

Labeling the environment as
youth’s concern, Smith claimed
that Nixon’s administration has
filed‘ more law suits against busi-
nesses and industries that pollute
than any other administration.

Smith described Nixon’s White
House staff as "the youngest in
history,” adding. "President

' Nixon believes young people have

a contribution to make."

C’ - On busing, Smith said, “Nixon

is pledged to the goal of quality
education for all. Is busing the
best or only way to achieve this

0 goal? I don’t think we have the
'_ answer yet.”

One student objected to what he

--Q-alled Nixon’s "one-sided" prime
 time TV speeches, preferring in-

jgstead news conferences at which
'an.ti- administration views could

be aired.

Smith answered, “Immediately
after Nixon’s speeches, the news
media is free to present the other
side. John Chancellor of NBC.
Eric Severeid of CBS, and others
can be heard giving their views.”

In discussing Nixon’s previous
news conferences, Smith remark-
ed, “I have read some of them.
How could Nixon take some of
that intimidation? Large news
conferences tended to produce
questions that were pointed and
barbed.”

Smith said he had ‘spoken to
CBS newsman Dan Rather who
expressed satisfaction with his re-
cently televised A Conversation
with the President. Rather. ac-
cording to Smith “was able to ask
Nixon more in depth questions
than ever before."

On Vietnam, Smith stated. "Dur-
ing the ’68 campaign, Nixon nev-

er promised he would end the war o

000 for an emergency generator
for the Cathedral of Learning.

To emphasize the need for in—'

creased maintenance expendi-
tures. the Chancellor pointed out

that the University has only one

window washer and it takes him’
over a year to make his rounds. ~

The Chancellor reported that
tuttion has risen 217 per cent
since Pitt‘ became "state related
and that further increases would
change the composition of the stu-
dent body by excluding lower mid-
dle class, first generation college
students. - .

Citing economy measures such
as no new programs, delayed
freshman .curriculum, no under-
graduate-business training, ter-
mination of non-tenured faculty,
defered security, cuts in the de-
velopment office and reduced
graduate enrollments, the Chan-
cellor stressed the University’s
cooperation with the governor’s
task force and the establishment
of a permanent liason with cor-
porate advisors. H

The solution which the Chan-
cellor posed consisted of increas-
ing efficiency by repackaging ed-
ucation by instituting external de-
gree programs. .,

/
immediately or pull out all the
troops at once. In essence-Nixon’s
election pledge was ‘vote for me
and I will do everything to get a
‘negotiated settlement.‘ I see/the
President’s latest Vietnam.move
as saying to the enemy, ‘Give us
our prisoners and stop the shoot-
‘ing and we will leave." I

Grad Students

‘ments . . .

by MICHELLE PILECKI

Pitt graduate students are await-
ing word from the Board of Trus-
tdes on the fate. of the proposed
Graduate - Professional Student
Association (GPSA).

According to the GPSA consti-
tution, the group is intended to:

“Represent the interests of all
graduate students in the function-
al aspects of university life and in
the surrounding communities;

“Promote interdisciplinary co-‘

peration among graduate and
professional schools both within
and outside the university;

“Create and enhance graduate
student involvement in every
phase of university endeavor to a
level of sustained pride in her
goals and achievements:

“Together with the faculty and
staff of the university, to pur-
sue academic excellence in grad-
_uate programs.”

5 Referendum F orseen

on Activities Fee

by BOB SCHUSTER

Student Government President
Tom Bailey stated at Thursday’s
meeting that there may be a ref-
erendum on the Student Activities
Fee in January, 1973, due to the
growing concern of legislators re-
garding its legality.

“To get it passed. we will
need public relations work to
show all what the fee provides,"
Bailey said in his report.

Until now the activities fee has
been collected by Student Gov-
ernment with students having no
voice in the matter. Legislators
are concerned as to whether this
is constitutional. If the students
vote to continue the fee, much of
the doubt would be erased.

Several Allocations Committee
decisions were reversed. The Pitt
Hockey Club was funded $6,646
including $3,440 for ice rental,
which was originally vetoed by the

Allocations Committee. The.

Board decided to grant the addi-

- tional money when it was learned
that the Athletic Department.

would not fund ice time for the
club.- -

The Commuter Association was
recommended $6‘,555'.50. In mo-
tions by Dave Bluey and Tom
Bailey, a recommendation was

sent back to the Allocations Com--

mittee, calling for the funding of
a Cycle Week demonstration,
$500, and full funding of the CA’s
telephone, an additional $100.

The Undergraduate Cabinet in
the School of Education request-
ed an increase of $1,000 above the
amount alloted for speakers in a
planned symposium on education.
Their request \was denied and

Bill Proposed to Ban  

their budget passed as recom-
mended, $2,165.

With little debate, the budgets

_were approved for Alpha Pi Mu,

an industrial engineering honor-
ary fraternity, $140; Black Action
Society, $27,270; Pershing Rifles,
$1,144.55; Undergraduate Aca-
demic Review, $8,409.60, and Pitt
Christian Fellowship; $1 002.85.

TOM BAILEY
SG President

A motion by Board member Bob

Stack not to fund Freshmen Camp
was defeated 3-2, with one absten-

tion after debate.
against funding because the camp
does not reach all of the fresh-
men.

John Simelis, co-chairman of
Freshmen Camp, pointed out that.
along with ‘providing those at-
tending with a chance to meet
more people, including faculty
and administration, leadership is
developed, as evidenced by the
fact that many current campus
leaders attend the camp. The de-

feat of the motion will allow .

Freshmen Camp to submit a bud-

get to the Allocations Committee.

Term , Paper Sales

by MIKE MILLER

State Senators W. E. Elerning
and J. Reibman have introduced
S. 1405, a bill which would make
the selling of dissertations, thesis
and term papers a misdemeanor
in the state of Pennsylvania.

William Cromer, a member of
Senator Fleming’s staff, stated
that the wording of the bill takes
care of the wholesaler as well as
the retail dealer in term papers. ‘

The bill, which reads in part,
“No person shall sell or offer for
distribution in the Commonwealth
any assistance, research, etc.used
to fulfill academic ‘require-,
will prevent out of
state firms from sharing their
wares with firms in Pennsylvania,
according to Cromer.

“There is nothing in the bill
that will prevent the offering of
copyrighted material for sale and
publication,” Cromer explained.

The bill also allows for counsel-
ing and tutorial services, accord-

7!

..{;E%, .

 

ing to Cromer. . -'

Cromer stated that he would
rather see the matter handled ad-
ministratively rather than by leg-
islation, but colleges and univer-
sitites were unable to prevent stu-
dents from using such firms.

He also felt that the Term Pa-
per firms were symptomatic of
the wholesystem in the United
States, citing speech writers for‘
politicians as an example.

“I hope we can get it out of com-

mittee and onto the floor and get  —

it moving," Cromer said. 1
He feels that the bill stands _a

good” chance of being passed. 
‘.‘How can anyone-be against it,” - 

he asked?

A spokesman for Write On, a
Pittsburgh, based research firm,
stated that the bill would not ef-
fect their operation. . -

“We are a research firm,” the"

spokesman said, “We do legal re-
search. The bill won’t apply\,to us.”

A PROPOSED bill will put a damper on,some college student's summer-
time fun by outlayving the sale of term papers.

Smith, “I don’t want to tell people

Joe Seltzer, representing the
Graduate School of Business. also
noted the problem of housing for
graduate students. He pointed out
that housing was a problem for all
the students andcould be handled
better by the GPSA than by the
individual grad student organiza-
tions. _ V

Ray Roedell of the Graduate
School of’ Library and Informa-
tion Sciences, added that health
insurance is a “farce” for grad
students.

One of the most controversial
points about the proposed asso-
ciation is the financing. Full-time
grad students will be assessed $5
per term. Part-time students will
be taxed $2.50.

Only 30 per cent-of the funds
collected will be retained by the
GPSA. The rest will be returned
to the individual schools in pro-
portion to their graduate enroll-
ment.

Schools‘ that have no graduate
student association will be en-
couraged to for": their own or-
ganizations. The GPSA will allo-
cate funds only to officially rec-
ognized groups representing their
their school.

Scheinbeim said that it would
be impossible to organize the
grad students without the money.

Inner Strength, Grace

by JOAN EASTBOURN

The Vendanta Society of Pitts-
burgh is a budding society among
many others in the United States.
Vendanta is a system of Indian
philosophy asserting the essential
unity of the godhead and the in-
herent divinity of all beings.

The Society presented a lecture
Thursday evening at the Univer-
sity entitled "The Gita: Divine
Grace and Self—effort.” It was
given by the Swami Nityabohan-
anda. the founder-head of the
group’s center in Geneva, Switz-
erland.

The Swani spoke of each man's
need to find himself—that it is
withinthimself that man finds the
reasons for existence. He noted
that “life would not present
problems for which it had no
solutions, and these answers are

to be found through introspec-

Grace, stressing that -“the pri-
mary grace is life as an individ-
ual.” .

In the discussion period that
followed. the Swami. when ques-
tioned how to acquire mental
strength, replied that it is the
responsibility of each man to
make his own challenge and then
to strive to overcome it.

In essence, the Vendanta philo-_ 0.
sophy accents the individual’s“’

control over his own destiny and-
the necessity for him to achieve
so that his status will be elevated

Local Medley, Singer Delight Crowd  

by BILL SMITH
Entertainment Editor

Institutions have long been a
stabilizing force in our society, be
they cultural institutions, social
institutions, institutions devoted
to learning, to the incarceration
of social misfits or the harboring
of “obsolete” senior citizens.

The term institution conjures
up a picture of high, unyielding
and lifeless walls.

Last Wednesday I was treated
to a delightful evening’s enter-
tainment by a wonderfully warm
and witty, living, breathing, 70
year old, folk-singing institution
by the name of Robert Schmertz.
Mr. Schmertz has spent all of his
70 years right here in Pittsburgh,

‘the place of his birth. .

L This isn’t all that remarkable,
for I'm ‘sure a quick perusal of

County records would reveal num— ’

erous similar cases. What disting-
uishes Mr. Schmertz from the
other long—term Pittsburgh na-
tive is how he feels about his home
and the manner in which he shows
it.

He loves this area and has made
studying its history his h/obby.
Coupling his research with his
own widely varied personal ex-
periences, he has written more
songs ‘about this neck—0f-the-
woods than anyone. '

These songs for the most part

have been written with the help
of his banjo, an instrument which
he says he doesn’t play but only
strums. - _ -

On Wednesday night another
Pittsburgh institution, the old
North Side Post Office, now the
Museum of Pittsburgh History,
opened its door in invitation to
the public to hear one of their
“neighbors" sing his own com-
positions of Pittsburgh-praise.

I was mildly surprised to see
both the main floor and balcony
filled to capacity with a varied
crowd. Long-hairs, young and old
rubbed elbows with small children
and gray-haired ladies-of-the-arts.

Mannequins ‘clothed in “olden
day” costumes silently stood on

, the perimeter of the audience and

a Victorian desk-of-drawers loom-
ed behind the stage area.

Above us a giant mobile made
of balloons and plastic kites dangl-
ed from the domed ceiling and as
the lights dimmed, I looked about
frantically for something less

than 50 years old to.crush my

cigarette on. ,
After a short biographical in-

troduction by local historian and
Press staff—writer George Sweat’-
nam, out came Bob Schmertz and
his group of family and friends.

From the beginning I was de-
lightfully captivated by the pleas-
antness of this architect-historian
with a banjo andthe spirit of a
poet.

Their first number. a light-
hearted historical tale was filled
with stumbling blocks but each
obstacle was overcome by the
calm assuredness of Schmertz’
presence and the happy spirit of
a close—knit unit enjoying their
interaction. I began to feel as if I
were just one of the friends spend-
ing a warm spring night on the
Schmertz’ front porch.

Then Ann Shapiro stepped to the

front for a beautifully plaintive

rendition of “The Lonely Grena-
dier," a song by Schmertz which
shows that the loneliness of the
soldier away from home hasn’t
changed from Revolutionary days
to now.

Next came a funny littleisong

done in French, entitled “Mom

The next song cemented my
respect for this man for it was a

tune that I had repeatedly been .

is “Angus McFergus McTavish

squirrel who was "faster_than

You Get What
* You Pay For

Student Government President Tom Bailey forsees a refer-
endum on the student activity fee next year and he is not optim-
istic about the outcome. ’

Many students resent paying the $12 fee because they feel
that they receive no benefit from it. Standard complaints in-
clude the feeling that students are paying to support activities in
which they do not take part. Other feel that the benefits gen-
erated by the fee aren’t worth $12. "

When compared with the activity fees at other schools.

_ Pitt’s fee is quite low. Duquesne students. for example, pay $100

per term. _ .
Pitt’s low activity fee pays for many services and activities.

It takes care of all of Student Government’s activities and
programs. These include lawyers on retainer who advise the Off

- a medical loan fund available to students, and all of the con-

certs, films and other entertainment sponsored by Student
Government. A

The fee also provides funds for student activities ranging
from ping-pong and film-making.to tutoring and sports car rac-
ing.

Students constantly complain about the condition of the-
Student Union. A larger levy could provide funds for improve-

-ment in this area.

The complaint that we get nothing for our $12 fee is un-

. ‘justified. We get what we pay for.

G L If the activity fee were abolished the University would be in
a sorry state indeed. With a -60 per cent commuter population

~ and no activities Pitt would become a giant high school with lit-
tie to offer students outside the academic realm.

 Grades Outdated  

Many arguments have beell advanced by progressive edu-

' .cators against the traditional grading system. but one of the
strongest is the fact that it has given birth to a profitable busi-

ness—the selling of term papers.
' Traditionalists argue that the grading system provides the

"only sound means of measuring "a students academic worth.

Students themselves have argued that the ABC system enables

"f them to measure their own performance. Without the grading
, .system, it is felt. students will become -lazy and slide through
. ‘I their academic career.

The traditional system is obviously outdated. however.
There are so many ways of getting around it that it has become‘
meaningless. The taking of multiple choice and true, false tests
-has been reduced to a mechanical exercise. Students experi-/
enced at taking such tests have developed methods using the

. ‘laws of probability and other tricks and can receive passing on

tests which contain material with which they are totally un-
familiar.

Term papers no longer provide a means of obtaining an

’ accurate sample of students knowledge andwill as they can be

purchased on the open market.
The rise of the term,,paper firm is an‘ indication of the de-

, cadence and meaninglessness of the traditional system.

Concepts such as the open university or the portfolio sys-
tems or systems combining practical work and academic study
must be re-examined to provide an alternative to the presen
system. , ~   1“

Primaries Reveal Democratic Split

by RON BROWN
Staff Columnist

After fourteen preferential pri-
maries and a dozen state dele-
gate-selection caucause. a poll-
tical pattern has begun to em-
erge from the 1972 campaign
trail that is in many respects all
too familiar. Brushing aside the
Lindsays. Jacksons and Hartkes
we find that once again the
Democratic Party is split along
seemingly unalterable lines. _

Excluding the Wallace faction.
the party is divided into the two
firmly established camps ofthe
Democratic left of the McCar-
thy-Kennedy days, now under the
new and improved management

-of the McGovern forces, and the

descendants of the old Roose-
velt working-class coalition. once
again under the banner of HHH.

Much like the 1968 scenario,
California is again the crucial
.primary; Texas will deliver its
delegates for Humphrey, and
Mayor Daley will "hold a sub-
stantial bloc of the Illinois dele-

' gation at the convention.

And in an undefinable way

the current primary battles have_

generated a sensation of deja vu.
In spite of economic woes and
gut reactions to the busing di-
lemma, the Asian war simply re-
fuses to Vietnamize itself and
remains on the front pages of
American newspapers and in .the
back of the minds of American
voters.

Much like Lyndon Johnson an-
nouncing his retirement on tele-
vision on the eve of Wisconsin.
Richard Nixon appears before
the nation the day after Penn-
sylvania and speaks on the war.
Back on TV two weeks later he
outlines a plan of aggression
that will save Hue and its Viet-
namese landmarks, a city that was
the focus of the Tet offensive and
of anti-Johnson sentiment in the
1968 New Hampshire primary. '

Security arrangements are far
into the planning stages for the
1972 conventions in hopes of re-
ducing the likelihood of -another
Chicago.

Yet while back room politick-
ing and obscure arrangements
lined up the delegate votes that
nominated Humphrey in 1968.
the quiet. plodding efforts of
Democrats throughout the na-
tion continue to add committed
delegates to the -McGovern tally.
With projections of more than
900 votes on the first ballot, a
victory in California and a‘ few
conversions among the delegates
at Miami could give McGovern
the magic number at 1509 dele-
gate votes needed to win the
nomination.

McGovern’s unexpected “front-
runner” performance has prompt-
ed observers to write that as soon
as voters realize his stands on
the issues, they will avoid him
like the plague. Some have
recently presented his, positions

on tax reform, abortion, mari-
juana, etc.,‘ each outdoing the
other in providing what they be-
lieve to be a valuable public ser-
vice to the voter, to enable
him to successfully identify and
eradicate the McGovern plague.

Some commentators have gone
so far as to state that McGovern
would be the Barry Goldwater
of the Democratic Party. Not-
withstanding the weight of such
claims. how many have said in
turn that Humphrey might be an-
other Adlai Stevenson?

Many staunch Democrats dis-

gusted with Johnson‘s war poli'- .

cies in the late sixties comment-
ed that at least with Barry Gold-

water you knew what you were ”

getting. Much like Goldwater.
McGovern's unquestioned and
characteristic honesty is certain-
ly his most powerful campaign
weapon. ’

And unlike the Goldwater sit-
uation, there is a much higher

degree of general dissatisfaction

with the performance of govern-
ment in 1972 that there was in
1964, a situation that would aid
any challenger running against
an incumbent.

In spite of all the recurring
themes, political analysts would
do well to tread lightly on pre-
dictions, for only back in Feb-
ruary, McGovern was given just
a one in fifty chance of captur-
ing the nomination.

Letters to the Editor

Reader Blasts
Lee's Press Column

Dear Sirs:
If we are to believe the Moth-

‘ ers Day message of your colum-
nist Lawrence Lee (Press, May 14 t.

the United States is populated
with ‘several million “traitors."
Nasty rhetoric like that does not
solve any problem. but there may
be an avenue yet unexplored by
Mr. Lee which is covered by
that good old Archie Bunker-type’
American axiom of "put up. or
shut up." "

In the closing months of World
War II. when military solutions
were daily proving disasterous
for the Germans, Hitler deputy
Heinrich Himmler suggested that
the many Nazi intellectuals who
were writing or speaking of
the dangers of Bolshevism be
formed into ‘an "intellectuals

,brigade" and sent to the Russian
'.frppt,, 

 Rosenberg. Reich Min-
~ist,er--for the occupied Eastern
Territories and chief ideologist
for National Socialism, protest-
ed. The Himmler retort was ob-
vious: “for years you have warn-
ed of the dangers of the Com-
munist menace from the securi-
ty of the academy. Now you can
join‘ the glorious crusade and
fight this menace as a common
soldier."

It is time. It is time for a de-

cade of intellectuals and geo-'

politicians and think tank con-
tractors who contrived and sup-’
ported our glorious crusade in
Indochina under three Presi-
dents to enlist in the ranks as
common soldiers. Then there will
be no validity to the charge of
young men dying in the wars
that old men create.

The Bundys. Roches. Kissin-
gers and their cold warriors com-
panions at home should make

' enough for a brigade. and many

of them could no doubt get com-
missions from Siagon. if’ your

President fails ‘to act. Surely‘

there would be room for Law-.

rl

. .. of the P.i_tt'yNe_ws. . . '

rence Lee. -

. Until he elects to do that
however, I suggest that Mr. Lee
confront one returned combat
veteran of Vietnam who oppos-
es the war, and tell him to his
face that he is a "traitor.”

_ Sincerely.
Russell W. Gibbons

SG Takes Stand

(Editor's Note: Tom Bailey, Stu-
dent Government presidenndraft-.
ed this letter on behalf of the stu-
dents at the University, protesting
the President's recent Vietnam ac-
tion.)

President Richard Nixon
c/o The White House
Washington. D. C.

Dear President Nixon:

We. the students of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh have not yet‘
taken to the streets i-n protest of
President Nixon’s’-f* address of
Monday,» May 8, .1972. but we
want to convey the ilnderstanding

that this silence cities not mean

that students are not concerned.

At a time when de-escalation
was promised, the mining of
North Vietnames harbors is a
blatant escalation of the war. We
can only hope that the Soviet Un-
ion and China react with restraint
in responding to this act of ag-
gression, and that the President
realizes what consequences this
position may lead to. Such action
can only result in widening the
conflict and further involving’
the Soviet Union and China, for
they also feel a commitment to
their allies.

Sincerely yours.
Thomas E. Bailey. President

 ‘To say the least, the

 spectacular. As a matter of fact, it was less than disap-
”oii'_iting. .
_i‘ The Panthers clobbered their earlier opponents and shot to
"‘6;'0’re6ord but by the end of the season they had been shot down
_o a record of 9-7. It’s an above average standing but losing sev-
, of the last 10 games is certainly nothing to rave about.

‘A ' -Sowhat was the mitters' problem?

A -‘As the Panther coach Bob Lewis kept repeating all season
ong, tliemitters had a strong case of “anemic” hitting. '
 '3 "We just didn’t- hit. we didn’t have enough scoring at home
' faway,” commented Ldwis. “I wasn’t impressdd with the hit-

ixkfe -'Sollie—‘ (Bob Solonickne, last year’s right fielder).”

_'Another major difficulty. in the Panther batting department
was an apparent dependency on last year’s batting ace, senior
ii‘-st baseman Ken Macha. Last season Macha rocked opposing
’itc'hers for seven home runs. 31 RBI’s (eighth in the country)

,_dr'in_the nation.
 It would have been a big order to expect Ma that to have the
‘T his ‘time around was well below .300 but even this did- not stop
‘ii'_n from participating heavily in the scoring.
 An example of this was his 10th inning game winning blast
,_'gainst Syracuse sailed 434 feet over the center field wall:

V "We depended on Ken just a little too much,” said Lewis.
-'.'But’when he’d start hitting we‘d start winning. It’s only a
Shame that we didn’t have a consistent .300 hitter around him in
_rder to score more runs.” .

C. , Despite 'Macha’s mediocre performance this season, it is
‘lmost a certainty that he will be drafted into professional
,as'eba_ll. He has been invited to try out for Cincinnati and
e. has stirred up a great deal of interest with other clubs. es-
jeicially the Pittsburgh Pirates and the New York Yankees.

_ "‘D,|le largely to the Panthers lack of hitting,’
h”e>__’72 season came and went with a mini-
ifium-of commotion. It was almost as if their
wasn’t even a baseball season played this year,
dging from the excitement ‘generated. Would
;hei'e have been more interest had the Pan-
hers been 1/6-0 and had Macha come back with 
another .415 season? 

Surely there would have been a little more H
but not enough. So why did the season go by almost unnoticed
,,xcept by diehard Pitt baseball fans?

.. The blame lies to a great extent with the inept sheduling of
games this year. First of all only.28 contests were slated, 16 of
which were eventually played while the rest were either can-
celled or rained out.’ Better scheduling would have considered

  
   
  
   
    
  
  
   
   
   
   
    
  
  
   
  
   
   
   
  
  
  
 
  
  
   

sity to ‘play as many games as possible. would have charted at
least 35 games: '

 Also, within the span of 12 days, the Panthers were.ex-
pectedgto play i_n six doubleheaders. Two of these twin bills were
5

Vbackitihe, next day to play two with Clarion.
if-Still another problem with the scheduling was the dating of

'e‘~"'m"ajority of the home games during the spring recess which
allowed very few students the possibility of seeing /their team
perform. As it turned out. only one contest was played at home
during classes.

 -“This year it seemed like we were always on a bus going
somewhere,” related Lewis. “We were away most of the time
‘when--the kids were back in school so they weren’t able to see
_many games. «

a

"‘‘’With next year’s schedule we’ll_try to balance that out,
we’ll try and play half at home and half away. We’re also going
u try to schedule 35-40 games, so that if we get in about 26‘ of
them we’ll be lucky.”

, _ I V Lewis meets with Pitt’s Athletic Director Casimir Myslin-
 ’”ski.today to determine next year’s card. The possibility of play-
ting’ fall baseball will also be explored at this meeting.

  New Gaulf-Javelin Wins

First Try as Pitt Car

by VINCE Di NARDO
Sports Editor

Overcoming a wet track and a
broken front wheel hub. the brand
new car of the Pitt road racing
team. the Pitt Javelin, got off to
a good start by winning the Steel
Cities Sedan Trans Am Race at
State Park, in Warren. Ohio. last
Sunday.

‘ Kicking off the East’s national
'72 campaign race, the Javelin
won its first race as a Pitt car
and under the leadership of Bob
Fryer.

Just as everyone was getting
used to the Pitt Camaro, Fryer
jumped at the opportunity to buy
the Javelin. And, he feels he is

better off.

-"The Javelin is the superior
car,” Fryer was saying, “it has
more horsepower and we've had
no engine trouble with it so far.”

The Javelin was Mark Dona-
hiie’s backup car last year. Dona-
hue, with a Javelin. went all the
way last year to cop the national
championship. It was purchased
from ‘Roger Penske Racing En-
terprisies A

About 38 cars, including Ca-
maros, Mustangs: Barracudas,
Corvettes along with the Javelin
participated in the race. Fryer
guided the Pitt car to the win in
its class by averaging 117.5
miilic a lap—about one—half sec-
ond off the lap record set by the
Camaro last year. When Fryer
crossed the finish line, he was a
full 35 seconds ahead of the near-
est competitor in the same class.

Fryer wasn’t too surprised
about winning the race as he was
about the number of Pitt people
there cheering for him.

“Every time I looked up, I saw
somebody from Pitt. I would

of problems qualifying.”

Once he qualified, though, it
was pretty obvious the Javelin was
on the way to victory in its class.
The driver could have broken his
own record but decided to “take it
easy." _ g

“I was ahead so I eased up. I
did things like keeping the RPM
down,” Fryer said. -

Aside from winning the race,

. the Javelin took a first step to a

return trip to the Trans ‘American
Sedan championship in Atlanta on
Nov. 26. Last year the Camaro
made it with about 40 points. Sun-
day’s win gave the machine nine

points.

A few more wins and a couple
of places and the Javelin will be
making the trip to Atlanta, again.

The Javelin will see its second
competition in two weeks, June 4,
at the Mid-Ohio Sports Car course
in Lexington, Ohio.

The Pitt crew will have two full
weeks to straighten out its minor
transmission problems at its Gulf
Station in East Liberty.

Compete In
Tennessee T

Bill Rea. Ken Silay and Dorel
Watley, who all figure to help the
Pitt track team in the Eastern
Championships (IC4A’) this
weekend in Philadelphia traveled
to Tennessee last weekend to tune
up.

,A new meet, the_,'_I‘om Black In-
vitational, was being held at the
University of Tennessee and Ban-
ner thought it would serve as a
primer to both the Easterns and
the Nationals. .

Rea won the long jump with a
24’71/2”. The jump was not up to
expectations, but the field. a for-
midable one, was not jumping
well as a whole. Rea has already
eclipsed 26'71/2”.

Ken Silay finished thNd in the
880 (the half mile) and Dorel Wat-
ley fourth in the yard dash.

' ‘..._.-

 

The Pitt track team hasn‘t lost a dual meet since 1968.
Last Wednesday at Temple University, head track coach Jim Ban-

ner’s squad kept the skein intact, as the tracksters defeated the Tem-I

ple Owls, 85-60. Banner did a_ lot manipulative switching and experi-
mentation while resting some of his top regulars. .

Temple was the last team to muster a dual win against Pitt four
years ago, But has fallenfour times since. Under miserable, rainy
skies, much like the ones in the Pittsburgh area, the outcome of the

the meet was never in real doubt.

Chuck Mazingo.won the quarter mile with a 48.9. Mazingo, who
usually toils in the mile relay on a regular basis, switched places with
Rich Jackson by running the first leg. Jackson ran the anchor leg, while
Dorel Watley took the day off. Ken Silay and Ted Bobby filled in the

middle legs.._ _ '

Byivirtue-of his fine performances, Steve Hein won first places in
both the shotput and_the,discu,s throw. Hein hurled the shot 50 feet.
While this WaS;.I10..t_' hisﬁinestjperformanee‘of the campaign, it was good
enough. The same cou‘l‘d'b"e' said ab'out"his performance in the discuss.

Hein hurled the rubber disc 153»feet.

Mike and Bob Schurko put. on a little bit of a brother act with their
show in the mile run. The Schurkos crossed the finish line tied, with a

time of4:11.-

Mickey Collins had a winning three-mile run. Collins’ first result-

ed from his 14:35.

Gary Risch, who specializes in the short, speedy events, took sec-V

onds in both the 100 yard dash and the 220 yard dash, while Bill Rea
(almost effortlessly) and Bob Pierce finished one-two in the long and

, triple jumps.

“We didn’t have guys in a lot of the events.” said Banner, explain-

ing the closeness of the score.
did a lot of experimenting.”

“We switched a lot of them around and

4 Banner’s future plans do not include a whole lot of dual meets on
the card. He would much rather concentrate on the bigger meets.

With this occurring. it might be a long time before the track team's
four year winning streak 1S snapped. in dual meets.

Meanwhile, bigger and more important things are ahead for the
tracksters ‘in the next few weeks. This weekend in Franklin Field in
Philadelphia, Banners forces will have the IC4A’s (Eastern Champion-

ships) staring them in the face.

It is no secret and no small wonder that both Banner and his

squad would like to cop this one.

On June 1-3, the NCAA finals will provide the best and final com-

petition of the season. It is uncertain right now who will make that trip I
to the Nationals at Oregon. ' I
