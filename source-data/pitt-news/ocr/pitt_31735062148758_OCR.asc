registrar.

(-lrades for the ﬁrst. semester of the present school yea r were

used in making‘ up the honor roll.

l-Iigliest honor was given to

those with a three point average, high honor to those \'i'i1'li. 2.7 to

2.9, and honor to those whose
average ranged from 2.2 to 2.7.
Forty-thcree men and women
had straight. “A” avei-ages to
receive highest honor, 12 received

high honor, and the remaining 578
are honor students.

Release of the honor roll at this
time, after a lapse of three years,
was made possible by new machin-
ery installed in the oﬁice of the reg-
istrar.

An increasing volume of work on
the ‘stall’ of the oﬂice made it neces-
sary to discontinue for a time the
task of compiling an honor roll each
semester.

“On the Edge of the Campus”

Friday, May 10, 1940

Baseballers, Track
Team to Face State

Predictor Sees
Pitt Track Team
As 72-59 Winner

The News track prognosticator
wasn’t quite sure whether he’d
make the Pitt track team a prohib-
itive favorite in the coming trouble
with Penn State at Pitt Stadium
until he saw Wednesday’s practice
session. However, he thinks after
the above workout that tomorrow
the Panthers will trim Penn State,
72-59, the identical score by which
they topped Indiana.

If the weather’s hot tomorrow
spectators can look for some great
performances. Joe Newman, the
junior hurdler who has been ﬂirting

with Ken Ryden’s University high ‘

hurdle record of 15 ﬂat all spring,
ﬁnally tied it in practice Wednes-
day. Len Powell, another member
of the bumper sophomore crop up
from last year’s frosh outﬁt was
right behind in 15.2. Both boys
will try to go below the 15-second
mark tomorrow.

Of course, the battle in the 100-
yard dash between Barney Ewell,
State’s national‘ AAU titleholder
and Hap Stickel, the powerful soph-
omore speedster, will feature the
program. And Frank Ohl, the sen-
ior ﬁyer must not be forgotten in
the 220, for he can give the dusky
State star plenty of competition.

Sophomore Jim Elliott hit over
190 feet in the javelin on Wednes-
day, but it’s doubtful whether he
can pull a win out of the hat to-
morrow since he matches tosses
against Nick Vukmanic, State cap-
tain and Drake relays, ICAAAA
and former NCAA crown winner.

Kish May Face
Bastian on Slab
In Stadium Fray

Tomorrow the Panther baseball
team tangles with one of the strong-
est collegiate teams of the East
when Penn State visits the Stadium
diamond.

The game is scheduled to get un-
der way at 3:15 o’clock but the
starting ‘time may be moved up
should the track meet preceding th'e
contestﬁﬁnish ahead of schedule.

Ed Bastian, sensational hurler,
will ~*pr,_obably oppose coach Mitter-
ling’s' performers. The Lion pitch-
er owns an enviable two-year rec-
ord of eight straight wins.

Big Ben Kish, fastball artist, is
expected*to'start for Pitt. The ex-
fullback’ holds the only win regis-
tered “by "the Panthers in seven
starts.

The past several days have seen
several important additions to the
ﬂoundering Panther squad. Among
the newcomers are footballers
Ralph Fife, Bill Fitchko and Rudy
Gradisek. A-Fitchko is expected to
aid the somewhat weak mound staff.

Mitterling has sent former third
baseman Vaiksnor to second in
place of Al Holbrook. At the plate
the new Pitt inﬁeld performer will
bat from the number seven slot.

Eastern Golf League
Faces Busy Weekend

Oakmont Country club will be
the scene of some of the East’s
classiest Collegiate Golf play today
and tomorrow when six Eastern In-
tercollegiate Golf associati.on teams
will decide the leadership of the
northern division.

Pitt takes part in three of the
nine scheduled matches. This aft-
ernoon they tackle Pennsylvania

and tomorrow they meet George-z

town and Princeton.

Fijis Capture
First llonors
In I-F Meet

Phi Gamma Delta took first place
in the annual fraternity track meet
last Wednesday, with a point total
of 43, exactly 24 more than its near-
est rivals, Kappa Sigma and Phi
Delta Theta, who were deadlocked
for the second notch with 19 points
each.

The winners were:

Hop, skip, and jump--Dickinson,
Phi Delts.

Broad jump — Dickinson,
Delts.

100-yard dash———J ones, Theta Chis.

220-yard dash-——-J ones, Theta Chis.

-440-yard relay-——Presse1, Roberts,
Bitner, and Thurbon, Phi Gams.

440-yard dash——-Davis, Phi Eps.

Shot put———Watson, Phi Delts.

High jump—Pressel, Phi Gams.

880-yard relay—Quick, Thurbon,
Pressel, and Burns, Phi Gams. _

Pole vault--Rodusch, Phi Gams.

Phi Cam. Team
Picked to W’ in

Sweepstakes

With all six men from their last
year’s team returning, Phi Gamma
Delta will be favored to lift the an-
nual fraternity sweepstakes title
from Phi Delta Theta .when the
carts line up in front of Thaw Hall
at 3:30 o’clock this afternoon.

While the champion Phi Delts
have only Dickinson back, last
year’s runner-up Phi Gams boast
the return of Dimit, Edmunds, Mac-
Neil, Thurbon, Pressel, and Bitner.

The route of the race will be the
sameas last year’s with the carts
starting in front of Thaw Hall and
racing down Bigelow to Lytton ave-
nue. The boys next push their carts
up the slope to the corner, then over
to Tennyson avenue.

Then comes the ride on the cart
down the dangerous hill to Bigelow,
the spot where the accidents usual-
13/ occur. The reason is the 90-de-
gree turn which a cart must make
in order to drive down the ﬁnishing
lap. The race will end up at the
starting spot.

In the ﬁrst of three heats Kappa
Sigma, Delta Tau Delta, and Phi
Gamma Delta will race. The sec-
ond heat will have Sigma Alpha
Epsilon, Phi Kappa, and Pi Lambda
Phi, and the last heat of the day
will show the darkhorse Pi Kappa
Alpha cart, the championship Phi
Delt pushers, and Theta Chi.

Hunt Leads Navy
Netmen Tomorrow
Against Panthers

Led by Davis cupper Joe Hunt,
Navy’s netters play host to Pitt to-
morrow in the first match of a two-
match Eastern tour by the Cathe-
dral courtmen.

Hunt lost only to national cham-
pion Bobby Riggs last year, and
has conquered the country’s out-
standing netmen, including Frankie
Parker and Welby Van Horn. Navy
recently downed Penn State, 9-0,
winner over Pitt, by an 8-1 score.
In that encounter, Philadelphia
champ Weinstein could win only
one game from Hunt.

Journeying to Grove City, Pa.,
last Tuesday to engage the Grovers,
the Panthers returned with a 5-4
triumph. Pitt’s Joe Kristufek won
over Beaver county champion
George Mccloskey in a torrid three-
setter, 6-4, 2-6, 6-2, in the after-
noon feature match.

Instructors to Turn in Senior

Grades to Register-by M ay 29

A letter requesting that senior
grades «;be' turned in. by Wednesday,
May 29, was dispatched to Univer-
sity instructqrs this week by the of-
fice of the registrar.

ing between the deans an.d regis-
trar concerning Whether or not an
official ﬁnal date concluding senior
work had beenor would be set.

Althought the letter made the re-
quest. for sending in the grades by
May 29, Registrar John G. Quick
emphasizes that this is not an ofﬁ-
cial University pronouncement but
merely an’ attempt to facilitate re-

Mr. Quick said:

“There is no difference in opinion
between the office of the registrar
and the deans. 

“It has been traditional for the
office of the registrar to get senior
grades early, but this ofﬁcenever
has and" never expects to name a
date on which seniors are through
with their-work. ~ " I
