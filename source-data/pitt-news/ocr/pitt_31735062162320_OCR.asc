P Senate Eyes New Health Plan

I‘v'-I-IDYHLM ..- .\ .,

 

 

BY SCOTT MACLEOD

Complete national health insur-
ance in the United Statescame one
step closer Wednesday through the
introduction of a proposal by
Senator Edward M. Kennedy
(D.—Mass.) and Representative
Wilbur D. Mills (D.-Ark.).

The Kennedy-Mills bill is a
compromise version of a liberal
plan supported earlier by Kennedy
and a more conservative plan
offered by the Nixon administra-
tion.

Speaking at a’ press conference in
Washington, Mills said, “We tried
to develop a program to sell to the
House and the Senate, and get a
bill moving and passed."

Both the Kennedy-Mills and the
Nixon proposal contain the same
levels of beneﬁts and rely on
insurance companies to pay the

   

bills. Both also cost approximately
$40 billion a year.

A major difference, however, is
that the Nixon plan would be
voluntary, whereas the Kennedy-
Mills plan would require participa-
tion by all Americans.

Other differences include:

--Lower income employees would
pay graduated premium payments
lower than those proposed in the
Nixon version. In both programs,
however. employers would ‘pay
three-quarters. and employees,
one-quarter.

--The Kennedy-Mills plan calls
for the federal government to

collect funds through the Social

Security System whereas the Nixon
program would have private
insurance companies collect ‘pre-
miums for individual policies.‘

-~Rather than have the program‘
managed by an arm of. the
Department of Health Education
and Welfare, as in the Nixon
proposal, the Kennedy-Mills plan
would create a new Social Security
Board reporting directly to the
President. ‘

--The new plan would lower from
$1500, the amount in the Nixon
plan. to $1000 the maximum a
family would pay in health-bills per
year. A

When asked to compare the new
compromise plan with Kennedy’s
now discarded version, M. Allen
Pond, Associate Dean of the
Graduate School of Public Health
said, “Kennedy’s other plan goes
too far too fast. It seems to me the

1 Denenberg Calls Pete ‘Political Wliirling Dervish’

BY BILL'HADUCK
US Senate candidate ‘Herbert S.
Denenberg brought his campaign
to the Pitt campus Wednesday.
labeling his primary opponent
Peter Flaherty a “political whirling

dcrvish" and pledging to “mobil-
ize public opinion."
Speaking to about 100 law

students, Denenberg said his
familiarity and experience in
dealing with people would be a
factor in his effectiveness in
Washington-. “I can mobilize
public opinion because that‘s what
I've been doing for the last 10 or 15
years." the former Pennsylvania
insurance commissioner said.
He could mobilize public opinion
because, he said. “I wouldn't be
‘afraid of the press. I'm willing to
talk to people." His non—fear of
publicity is evidenced, he said. by
his years as insurance commis-
sioner.
‘ “When I started out, nobody had
heard of.the insurance department.

 

V prevent another

Now I've got higher“recognition
than a US Senator."

Denenberg said his primary
opponent, Pittsburgh Mayor Pete
Flaherty, “doesn’t know what he’s
doing. He didn't know whether he
wanted to run for senator or
governor. He doesn’t know
whether to support Shapp or not to
support Shapp. .

"In '72, he was sitting on his
hands while I was out campaigning
for the better candidates. 1 had
President Nixon figured out in 1948
and I was campaigning against him
in '72."

“I was talking about no-fault‘

years ago. I was against excessive
defense budgets. Iwould like to be
iudged by what I've done in the last
10 or l5.years." Denenberg said.

He claimed public financing of
political campaigns might elimi-
nate political corruption. “It would

administrations’s plan was a logical
step forward to good quality
coverage for large numbers of
people.”

Pond said the new compromise
version was probably “an accomo-

, dation worked out that would have

a better chance of passing than the
Kennedy-Griffin. bill (Kennedy's
liberal version.) , _

“It might very well have a
chance," Pond said of the Kennedy
Mills program. '

Kennedy pointed out in a news
conference, about $1 billion could
be saved annually by having the

premiums rather than private

ing about how to pay for their next
campaign."

Citing F Iaherty, Denenberg said,
"‘He’s on the mayor’s payroll at
$35,000 a year, and you know
where he is? He’s‘ out campaigning
in Montgomery County and being
paid for it with taxpayer's money.”

Reiterating a former point he
made about "shaking up the
senate." Denenberg said, “When I_
get down to the Senate. it's never
going to be the same again."

In other issues. Denenberg said
he would support a bill authorizing
capital punishment in certain
cases. He said. however. that most
ideas on capital punishment are
merely opinion.

“I've had a district attorney who
sent three people to the electric
chair tell me that his opinion on the
death penalty changes every day
according to what he reads in the
papers." .

Pitt Students Receive
.The.Good Word Free

Waterbeds represent an exciting and serious improvement
over the old fashioned boxspring/mattress. Doctors have rec-
ognized the therapeutic and hygienic values of the waterbed
for many years. When sleeping on a waterbed, your back,
shoulders and hips receive total floatation support. Body
weight is distributed more evenly than is possible on any con-
ventional bed, making a waterbed the most comfortable and
healthful sleeping surface available. A waterbed’s‘ gentle heat
helps relax tense muscles_while the firm floating support lulls
you into a deep, restful sleep.

A girl on the Cathedral lawn,
reading her newly acquired Bible,

. said. “The Bible really isn't on the

top ten reading list, you know, it's
a pretty good book. I'm kind of
glad I took one.” .

The Gideons International was
founded in 1898. It grew to be an
international organization and to-
day distributed Bibles in 98
different countries. Abroad,
foreign nationals, not Americans,
give away Bibles, and so far, 110
million Bibles have been distri-
buted worldwide.

Gideon Bibles can be found
nearly everywhere. In hotel rooms.-
motels, prisons, army barracks,
and hospitals. Now the little green
plastic coated New Testament can
even be found in the homes of
9,000 Pitt students who took a
copy.

Was it hard work. to stand in the
sun for 8 hours passing out nearly
l0.000 Bibles? Williams said.
“When the Lord sends us to do a
job. he does it for us. It was really
no work at all."

PA Bill Would Aid Alcoholics

BY CAL RITCHEY

A new treatment program for
chronicalcoholics has been pro-
posed by the Governor's Council on
Drug and Alcohol Abuse in
Pennsylvania, according to the
Council's Executive Director Rich-
ard E. Horman.

If the proposal becomes law,
alcoholics "and derelicts could
become a minor part of the
overnight population of local
prisons throughout Pennsylvania. ,
The bill would amend the “Drug
and Alcohol Control Act" (Act 63)
of I972 and would eliminate the
crime of public drunkeness from
the state’s law books, Horman
said.

Horman’s proposal, scheduled to
be introduced in the state
legislature this week, calls for
“intake units”, to be set up in
“eight to ten” locations throughout
the state. Three such units are
currently operating in Philadel-
phia, Erie, and Delaware Counties,
he said. All such units would be
financed with both federal and
state money through the Council.

If the idea becomes law, a
Pennsylvanian found intoxicated in
public would be taken to one of
these units by a counselor or
“para-professional" such as a
reformed alcoholic.

A medical examination would be
administered and, if necessary, the
detainee would be sent to a hospital
for treatment. If no immediate
medical treatment was needed, he

would be kept in the" unit_until he
was “detoxiﬁed." _according to
Horman.

Chronic alcoholics would be
guided toward medical. psycho-
logical and vocational rehabilitation
through the center. They would
also be given assistance in
obtaining a iob, if necessary, and
would undergo counseling “until
they became a normal functioning
member of the community,"
according to the proposal. V

“Alcoholism is a health problem,
not a legal problem,’-’ Horman
said. “This bill will take

' alcoholism out of the courts and put

it in the hospital and treatment
centers where it belongs.”

Horman said the legislation is
“most needed."
intoxication “is a victimless crime
that is draining enormous man-
power from police forces in the
state." He said he hope this bill
“will free the police to handle ‘real
crime.‘

“Picking someone up and
putting him in a drunk tank is the
best way to assure he’ll be back

therelagain in three or four days,"

“It is inquiring for the purpose of
deciding whether or not charges
will be brought against the
President of the United States,”
Rodino said.

"That will depend on the
committee's iudgment and decision
only after a full consideration of the
evidentiary material presented
tothe committee," he said.

Although there has been no
formal response from the White
House, Doar and St. Clair have had
a number of meetings since Feb. 25
at which the ‘White House lawyer

_ has insisted the committee be more

speciﬁc in asking for White House

. material.

In the letter dispatched today,

which repeats the information
contained in the original request,
the committee spells out the dated
down to the hours and minutes of
the conversations between Nixon
and his chief aides that the
committee is interested in.

Doar said in the letter that the
committee had no interest in
anything said in those conversa-
tions that did not relate to the
Watergate cover-up or other acts
being investigated by the Water-
gate grand iury.

“But in the final analysis," Doar —

said, “We shall not be thwarted by
inappropriate legalisms or by
narrow obstacles to our inquiry.
We have waited patiently to get the
recorded conversations. We will
subpoena them if we must."

BY BRIAN DUNN
"A Little Help From Your
Friends” may be forced out of
business if Student Government's
Committee on Student Affairs
(CSO) does not reverse the
recommendations made by the
Allocations Committee (AC) at the
Student Government Board (SGB)
Allocations hearings Wednesday.
AC recommended zero funding
for “Little Help,” which had
requested $4448.17 for their annual
operating budget. The Committee
feels the group is duplicating
“existing services provided by
outside resources within the
community,” the programs should
be handled by medical and
counseling professionals, and “the
organization has problems deciding
on its direction.”
.“It's very unclear to us exactly
what they wantfto do and where

‘-they want to go," said Bill Barker,

member and chief spokesman at

the hearings for the committee.
“Little Help" member Larry

Raftery said, “The whole goal of

the “Little Help" organization is.

supposed to be peer-to-peer
counseling. It's not supposed to be
professional and it's not supposed

to be paraprofessional.

“When it was founded two years
ago, it was said, that a lot of
students are frightened off by the
Counseling Center and the profes-
sional organizations like the Health
Center, and that-they'd be more
willing to discuss their problems
with a peer group.”

Rather than accept or reiect the
AC recommendation, SGB voted to
send the matter to CS0 for them to
“determine if the organization is a
worthwhile one." The new CSO
will hold their first meeting of the
term Tuesday to discuss the issue.

Board member Paul" Hertneky
said, “We feel CSO will make
‘Little Help’ redefine their pur-
poses." Hertneky and fellow SGB
member Bruce Keeler said they
will vote against the group as it

stands, based on their present
knowledge. SG President Mike
Furick said he doesn't know

enough about the issue yet, and the
other SGB members were unavail-
able for comment.

According to Raftery, “Little
Help” receives about 20-30 calls
per week during the fall and winter
terms, and has a staff of about 25.

“We're trying. to find other

places for funding," he said
Thursday. “It looks now like we'll
probably have to close down.

“We always allow flexibility in
dealing with the people who call us
and we're going to have to be
ﬂexible in working with the Student
Government recommendation. If
the CS0 recommends a drastic
change in our group, we'll have to
talk it over among ourselves and
see if we'll abandon the proiect."

“Little Help” member Alexis
Samulski also, said the program
probably will be dropped if they
cannot continue “providing the
same services we’ve been provid-
ing.” '

At the hearings, Hertneky

questioned several groups- about-

sex discrimination, which is out-
lawed in the CS0 by-laws.
Representatives of the Men's Glee
Club maintained they are not
discriminating because any studnet
may ioin the Heinz Chapel Choir
and women may join the Women's
Choral. '

“I don't understand why you're
trying to create trouble between
groups," Mike Schnitzler, Glee
Club President said to Hertneky.

“I’m not trying to create trouble,

In Allegheny County the public
intoxication arrest ﬁgures are
“about the same as in Philadel-
phia," according to a source at the
Allegheny County Jail. -The source
said that‘ “Alcoholics should be
decriminalized as much as possi-
ble. The chronic alcoholic should
be treated as a medical case rather
than a criminal case. Some
differentiation must be made,
however, between the crime of

I’m trying to uphold the CS0
by-laws,” Hertneky replied. He
also questioned the Society of
Women Engineers, the Arnold Air
Society, Angel Flight, and Persh-
ing Riﬂes about sex discrimination.
Hertneky later admitted he
concentrated on the issue to point
up the need for change in the
by-laws rather than to change the
groups. He prepared an amend-
ment allowing discrimination in
groups like the Glee Club.
I The amendment says, “The Club
shall not “invidiously" (i.e. unfair-
ly) discriminate on the basis of

race, religion, or national origin, or _

19

sex. The previous measure 'did
not contain the word “invidious-
ly;" the‘ definition of which is to be
determined by the Board.

At Thursday's meeting SGB sent
the fates of the Pitt Road Racing

Team and the Pitt Hosts to CS0 to \

determine whether the groups will
maintain their University recog-
nition.

The AC told the Board they were

“uncertain as to who is benefiting _

from this organizagtion .lRoad

body or the drivers.” '

Barker said, “We really want to
have CSO give us deﬁnite answers

questions are out of the way, then
we can start working on their
budget."

“We've looked at their budget, but '

The Pitt Hosts, which requested-,

Voter Registration

ProteCtYourRight  Vote   

BY BET NELSON

Young people from the ages of 18
to 20 were given the right to
register and subsequently the right
to vote with the passage of the 26th
Amendment to the US Constitu-
tion. The power of the vote is one
of the .most guarded rights
guaranteed by the Constitution.

Young people were given a direct
vehicle to help shape the man-
agement and development of the
American society through the
political system.

Students have not taken this
privilege seriously. They have not
cared enough to register and
exercise their vote. Students are
denying themselves input into the
political system simply because
they could care less. This is a far
cry from the political activism of
the ’60s, when students could not
vote until they were 21.

It would be‘ understandable if
students were blocked from regis-
tering by hostile county commis-
sioners, outrageous registration
requirements or an unreceptive
community. That is not the case
here in Allegheny County.
Registration is in fact easier than
registering for fall classes here at
the University.

- The. county commissioners are
willing to set up a voter registration
field site here on campus.

Pennsylvania registration laws are
relatively simple compared to those
of other states. In fact. students in
Alabama, California, Connecticut
and Michigan were forced to take
legal action to register. Even the

Head for Europe

  Local Summer. Market

BY BILL HADUCK

ln a few more weeks. most Pitt
students will be winging their way
to Europe for another summer of
fun in Paris or London or Madrid.
Of course. some of the more avant
garde people will chuck the molds
of Pitt tradition. and just hang
around Pittsburgh. working at a
summer iob. For them. the
situation doesn't look good.

- “Jobs are bad. there's very few

“And 1 don't expect the market to
get any better until June. when the
recession starts to improve.

Unicycle Record

BY BILL HADUCK
Two sophomore engineering
students broke the old Pitt Unicycle

' Club record of 10 laps around the,

Cathedral Thursday, when. they
‘pedaled their one-wheeled vehicles
a total 12 times on the sidewalk
surrounding the building.

Battling heavy winds, club
president Tim Sweeney, and
member John Candee completed
7.3 miles, breaking Ann Doerfler’s
1973 record of 10 laps.

Freshman Shellie Cain came in
second with ﬁve laps.

If they fall off, riders can start

steel mills and the outlook there is
‘Yeah. we're going to hire for the
summer. but we don't know when.
and we don't know how many.

“In the past. they couldn't wait
until students were out of school.
They would be pushing me to get
students to‘ take physical exams so
they could begin work the day
school was out. Thisyear. they're
not even worried about them taking
physical exams."

Although Rush expected the
local mills to hire students for
summer work eventually, he said
the outlook still doesn't appear that
good.

“I expect the mills will hire less
people than they did last year‘.
Probably around three of four
hundredvlaborers. .'Last year they
hired between .six and seven
hundred.”

Rush said the reason for the
dropoff in summer mill hirings
could be attributed to a no strike
clause in the steel workers
contract. “Before a strike. they'll
increase production. Right now.
there's no need to rush.

Pittsburgh doesn't offer much of
anything else. Rush said, “lt's'a

Guards Plea

CLEVELAND, Ohio AP--Eight
former Ohio National Guardsmen
pleaded innocent yesterday at their
arraignment on federal charges
stemming from the 1970 Kent State
University shootings. b

A federal grand jury indicted the
Guardsmen last Friday after
investigating the May 4, 1970,
confrontation of antiwar demon-

offers have declined slightly from
last year also. A problem. Rush
noted. is "this year all the
engineers want to stay home. Out
of town. they could get half again
the salary they'd get here."

He said the same thing was
happening in other technical fields.

“We have programs where they
pay you to get valuable experience.
and l can't give them away."

Rush suspects the attitude
against leaving home for the
summer is responsible for the small
number of applicants in these fields
also. '

Rush mentioned secretarial work
as .having summer job potential.
“Somebody who can type 45 or 50
words a minute can get a job with
Manpower or Kelly Girl, who’l|
send ‘them to a major industrial
firm.”

He said people wanting indus-
trial secretarial work on their own
should go to the plant itself. “If
they go to the ﬁrm's headquarters.
like the US Steel Building
downtown. they'll only get bogg.ed
down in red tape. The best thing to
do is to go right to the plant."

students were shot to death, nine
were wounded."

The defendants were charged
with ﬁrings at or near the 13
victims. depriving them of their
civil rights in violation of federal
law. Five Guardsmen also were
charged with aiding and abetting
each other in the action.

s '§«Thoughv Mary Briscoe, /coordi;
5nLator of Pitt’s women’s studies
Tprogram, was /talking about the
‘_;wom__en’s movement as a whole,
she might well have been speaking
about Pitt's women’s studies
‘program in particular. Since the
program’s somewhat ‘stormy intro-
'_duction in fall 1972--Briscoe said
the program had trouble getting
passed by the Faculty Senate
"because they thought women’s

fmen’s studies has made tremen-
dous progress, despite severe
ﬁnancial strains and a 40% cutback

proposed for the program. i
Along with the institution of the
‘women’s studies program, five
one-t-hiird time (non full time)
faculty members were to be hired
to teach jointly in the program and
asdepartment. Only three, Briscoe,
English; Irene Frieze, psychology
and Maurine Greenwald, history,
were ever hired.

, “Money and staff are the main
problems,” Briscoe said. “We
certainly have no problem in
enrollment--our courses fill.”
. Some real faculty interest ‘is
evident also. Over 50 faculty have
taught courses in the program
since its inception. And this is the
"bright spot in the program’s
picture. The number of courses
offered has grown from six during
ffallterm 1972, to 19 scheduled for
next fall. Enrollment figures have
steadily increased also--221 stu-
dents registered in women’s
studies courses that ‘first term; 702
students participated last fall. But
{the problems of money and staff
,_'continue to haunt those dedicated
-{to the Pitt program.

Though the women were hired as
one-third time members of the
_ ‘program, that one-third isn't
' computed on the normal working
week. Briscoe estimated she
..‘spends sometimes 30 hours each

"week on women’s studies, in
addition to her duties in the
English department. Pitt's wo-

 men's studies was a program in
;'name only when the staff and
faculty were hired, Briscoe added.
__ .and the faculty not only have to
V ' teach but are responsible for the
- structure and efficiency of the
program.
’ “The job of setting up the
program was extremely strenu-
rous,” Briscoe. explained, “and
we’ve had to focus, because of the
needs of the program as a

_ ' just developing a set of courses and

I program running. And I think that
duality is sort of the way I see the -

program now. I think that we’ve
accomplished an amazing amount
but I don’t think that any of us can
sustain the workload at the same
pace.”

Amy Linn. whose self-designed
maior includes women's studies,"
agreed the program has made
great progress. “I'm amazed at
the speed with which women's
studies has been put together. It's
incredible--the number and variety
of the courses offered. There's a
lot of room in which to move (within
the program)."

Part of the staff and funding
problem seems to stem from the
fact that women's studies is a
program and not a department.
Because programs do not receive
instructional budgets to pay their
faculty, women's studies faculty
concentrate most of their time on_
the administrative jobs of ar-
ranging for instructors from var-
ious departments to teach courses
cross-listed under women's stud-
ies.

“Seventy-five percent of our
time is spent in talking to people
who want to teach and then
persuading their chairman to loan
them to us,” Briscoe said. “It’s
exciting that many [50 faculty
taught courses] people have
wanted to help, but it does not
promote stability in program
offerings. It is all subject to the
chairman's approval and during
these times when everyone is
under budget pressure, chairmen
are often very reluctant to . add
courses. ' I

“I think we have the ability t
offer 15-20 courses a term. given
the current interest--it seems to
have sort of stabilized. We might
do more but I think those of us who
are joint appointments don’t feel
we should do more until we get
more staff, more faculty teachirig
with us. i -

 
 

“AWe're always scrambling for.

 

“The fact that we’re a program
also makes it difficult because it
means you continually have to go to
departments and argue the interest
that has been shown by the
undergrads and grads, in a
particular course in the depart-
ment. It means that you’ve really
got to break down some of the
stereotypes that departments have
about women’s studies.”

Though a great deal of the
administrative duties which con-
sume the time ofiwomen's studies
faculty members seem to stem
from the fact that it is a program
and not a department, the women
seem more than willing to wrestle
with these disadvantages to retain
the advantages they feel the

1/

program setup has over that of a
department.

“We're not a department be-
cause we think it’s important to
have input into the various
departments in the University. By
offering courses through other
departments, and through the ioint
appointments, we feel we have
much more of an impact," Frieze
said.

Greenwald and Briscoe agreed.
“The fact that we’re a program
means that we are not isolated from
the operations of the University as
a whole, that_we’re not a separate
department,” Greenwald said.

I “This has meant that welve been

able to have an impact on particular
departments that previously had"
not felt that women’s studies -was
an important contribution to that

'department’-so course dfferings.

And more important, we are
getting courses into departments
that previously had not offered
them.” —
While agreeing with the desir-

ability of maintaining input to all
the University departments
through the interdisciplinary pro-
gram setup, Briscoe noted a
weakness in having a‘ women’s
studies program at all. “I think
one of the dangers of having a
program called women’s studies is
that people who teach other things
in traditional disciplines think
anything having to do with women
should be done ’by the women's
studies program. And our goal is
eventually to encourage and ensure
that every discipline consider the
problems of women and the
information and history of women.

— “I used to think women’s studies
would be unnecessary in say 25 or‘
50' years. But I'm getting less
hopeful as the time goes on

-because the resistance to consider- .'

ing the questions which we are
asking seriously in‘ traditional
discipline is very strong," Briscoe
said. , ,
“ldealistically it would be
beautiful if women’s studies
weren't needed,” Frieze agreed.
“It would be very nice, for
example, if the material I teach in

Susie-secretary and I felt that with
my degree I was qualiﬁed for

The frustration of constantly
being asked how fast she could
type and take shorthand, when
applying for non-secretarial _iobs, is
what forced Susan Snyder first into
the women’s movement, and then
into the women’s studies program
at Pitt.

Snyder's v problems began after

she graduated from Pitt in 1971 '

with a political science degree.
“Four years earlier I was "a
secretary at the Med School. I had
taken a medical secretarial course,
which was a year and a half
program, at Robert Morris. So
when I got my degree in political
science, I wanted to something
related to that," Snyder explained.

“I think that frustration (of
finding a related job) is what made
me go to my first NOW (National
Organization of Women) meet-
ing." .

first step is getting‘these.courses

accepted as general courses within.’

a department, and we’ve had to
really_ fight for that in some
departments where a women’s
course is not seen as legitimate.”

But colleague Greenwald doesn't
see women's studies as a stopgap
measure. “I don’t see ‘that
women's studies is finite. I don't
see that doing research in any

given area that you will have finally _

reached a point at which there'll be
no more questions to ask, where
there'll be no more problems to
investigate, where there’ll be no
more angles to explore," she
explained. -
“I don't see women's studies in
terms of research ending at some
glorious point when some chapters
have been integrated into texts.
That’s one very simple goal.”
“I think if women’s studies goes
under it’s going to be not because
there isn’ta need or a demand but I
think that it’s vulnerable to being
eliminated or limited by the
economic situation which presently
exists in universities. All the
programs are in difficult ﬁnancial
situations. I think what women’s
studies is going to experience is the
strain’ of economic constriction.

get an understanding of their
history, and develop‘ pride in
themselves, then they would begin
toset higher goals for themselves.
But this [educational process] must
begin earlier than college,” she
said, explaining her interest in
secondary education.

Snyder plans to develop some
kind of women’s studies to teach at
the high school level, possibly as a
social science--an elective-type
course. She has discussed this idea
with some high school principals in
Cleartield, Pa., where she plans to
move after completing her wo-
men's studies" certificate. The
proposal has been fairly-well
received, she feels.

“So much of your education is
socialization," Snyder added.
“It's the idea of setting higher
goals--why can't a woman be
governor, instead of simply typing
the papers? But I don't think it can
be done until we develop a
self-confidence." And developing
that self-conﬁdence is what Susan
Snyder thinks women's studies is

. of coming down.

(Continued from Page 6)
Women's studies programs will

depend very much in the long run‘

on how much the administration
stands behind the demand for the
courses and the interest in them.”

Though the program's orienta-
tion is understandably primarily
academic, Pitt's women's studies
also serves as an information
center for university and commun-
ity activities of particular interest to
women, and as a model for other
schools presently developing wo-
men's programs.

“We have requests from all over
the country on our women’s studies
program," Greenwald said. “In
some respects the University of
Pittsburgh's women's studies pro-
gram has become a model for other
universities and colleges setting
women's studies. We runakind of
information service--anything that
deals with women has kind of
logically been funneled to the
women's studies program--so we
offer a lot of information generally
about activities that deal with
women that are going on around
the campus. We also get a lot of

inquiries about services which
concern women, like daycare, for
example.

Though enrollment in women’s
studies courses has increased

steadily, student participation in
the program itself has taken a
drastic plunge.

Pitt’s women’s studies program.

“The number of students who
want to be actively involved in the
program, as they were four years
ago, has dwindled to practically
nothing," -Briscoe said. Several
students were enthusiastically
working on various program
committees early last fall, she
added, but during the term, course
work and exams finally took their
toll.

Freize too was very concerned
about the lack of active support.
"Even though our classes are
enormously popular. very few
students drop by the office and say

‘Hey. I want to do feminist
theatre,’ a literary magazine, or
whatever. But from what I

understand from talking to people
here and from what I have seen
from where I came from, the
student interest in general is kind
Student activism
is going down which is somewhat
disturbing to us, because we have
really counted on these people
coming in and doing things with
us." The women’s studies pro-
gram will effect society from the
university community on outwards,
its proponents feel. “I see the
program as instrumental in edu-
cating and opening up the whole
Pitt community to women’s is-
sues.” student Amy Linn said. She

2-..ondResponsibi/ify

cited the confidential forms avail-
able for reporting any sex
discrimination with the University
as one concrete advance, urging
women to take advantage of the
forms. “I see the program as
women making room for new
information about us,” she added.’

“There's a lot of cross-reali-
zation among courses--people say-
ing, ‘In such a.course we learned
this.' They do this in my course
and I assume they take information
from my (women's studies) course
back to their other course. So that
through the students I think a lot of
the faculty are getting their
consciousness raised," Frieze said.

“The effect of women's studies
on society," she continued. “is
raising people's awareness of what
sex roles are, how sex roles

influence our thinking. And then to i

look critically at that and to see
which parts we think are valid and
which parts we like and which parts
we don't like." _,
Briscoe took a slightly different
tact, linking women’s studies with
government legislation to deter-
mine its total effect on society.
“I think that legislation works
faster in some ways than teaching,
and if you look at the effects that
legislation has had, for instance, on
black civil right, then you can see
how slow the process is. But there
is a direct power in legislation if it
can be enforced, that teaching does
not have. And so I think that you
can see shorter range gains
through legislation than through
teaching. That doesn’t mean that I
think that teaching doesn't have
any effect, because I think that it
has to work in both ways."
Greenwald added, “One of the
goals of women's studies in terms
of the University is to legitimize
serious examination of women's’
experiences in all fields that are
offered in the University. In terms

' of the students it's to give them

some opportunity to explore their
own experience and to explore sex
roles and women's activities. In
each of the disciplines this has
meant a scrutiny or examination of
what's been traditionally defined
as the important content of that
individual field. It’s a kind of
adjustment of perspective to
include a group which hasn’t been
given. much attention previously.”

“I think it's always been the role
of the liberal arts tradition since its
inception to question what is and
what ought to be in the world,"
Briscoe added. “Some people are
afraid that women’s studies is
bringing politics into the classroom
and I would argue that the
university has always been a
political arena. I'm
anything now that I wasn't doing
when I was an undergraduate in a
philosophy course.

“I’m asking questions about
truth and _iustice and freedom and
responsibility.”

BY SCOTT MACLEOD
and
SHARON SEXTON
The following is an interview
with H. John Heinz III (R. 18th

District), which touches on ques-_

tions of impeachment. the future of

the Republican party and how that

future is tied into his bid for
re-election.

Question: In a recent speech at
Pitt, Elliot‘ Richardson said the
Republican party wasn’t going to
suffer much damage from Water-
gate, that it would likely reassert
itself and perhaps become the
majority party again. How do you
feel about this projection?

Heinz: I certainly hope he's
right. But, I'm concerned when I
see-results such as those in the
Cincinnati special Congressional
election. In the Gladison Lukens
election Republicans voted ex-
tremely heavily and of course the
Republican. Cradison. lost. He got
48% of the vote and Lukens got
52% of the vote. Gradison.
however is considered a superior
candidate to Uukens. I think the

only explanation you can find for,

that kind of electoral result is that
Republicans are of two minds about
their party. They are going to. as

they did in Cincinnati. send a
message to the Republican party.
to the White House and perhaps to
the President himself. that they are
unhappy with Watergate and
they‘re unhappy with perhaps the
way the President has handled
Watergate. I can't get into the
minds of all the Republicans that
did vote for the Democrat. but I
think that some kind of psychology
like that is behind it.

Q. How do you feel about the
election for Saylor’s seat? Do you
think it might have some implica-
tions for Pennsylvania Republicans
running for reelection?

Heinz: That election was of
course more encouraging. Even
though the Republican lost. he only
lost by 150 votes. And that was a
district that. although John Saylor
had won it quite substantially. had
a, surplus of 8.000 or
registered Democrats as I recall.

I like to think that in Pennsyl-
vania the Republican party has a
stronger and more positive image
than it has in other states. We
have a great tradition in Pennsylr
vania. It goes back many
years--recently‘ there’s been
Dwight D. Eisenhower, a very
popular president. Bill Scranton,

0. How are the Republicans you .

meet in the campaign expressing

Heinz: People express two kinds
of dissatisfaction without necessar-
ily respect to party. They say they
don't like Watergate and they don't
like Richard Nixon, and they think
he’s a crook and is covering up, and
the sooner he's out of there the

if/\Young Republican Looks at

   

(Crnzti/tried from Par/e 8)
minority of people who just want to
overthrow the presidency. That it
is perhaps a construction which the
news media are secretly behind.
There are people who think that
after dealing with the problem
called Watergate for 12 months
that's enough. They say it's time
to move on to something else iust
on that basic principle.

Those two groups cut across
quite a lot. There are Republicans
and Democrats in both groups.
And fairly significant numbers in
both groups. Each group. of
course. is strongly for impeach-
ment and on the other hand
strongly against it. The Republi-
cans in either group ‘obviously are
polarized. And there are some in
each group. And if there’s 20 or
25% of the Republicans in each
group it means that no matter
where you stand as a Republican
candidate you are going to get a
shellacking from one or the other
of these groups.

0. How do you feel about your
chances for reelection?

Heinz: The candidate is-— the
worst person to ask about that. The
only way you can approach
reelection is to run scared.

Q. Are you running scared?

Heinz: Ihave always run scared.
I think one always approaches an
election with a sense of urgency.
and commitment? One of the
significant things of being a
member of the House of Repre-
sentatives is since we do have to
confront our record every other
year at the ballot box, I'd like to
think the members of the House
tend to be more responsive to

solving, the kinds of problems the
people have. And when one does
have a sense of urgency I think you
tend to work harder on people's
problems--and that's good.

Q. A recent study showed only
one_ out of eight Republican
senators running for reelection felt
they wanted Nixon to come to
stump in their district. Do you
want him to stump for you?

Heinz: I'm not going to ask the
President to campaign: If he
offered I would ask him not to come
in. If he. however, wanted to come
to this area on official business I
would encourage it. ~

0. What are your colleagues in
the House saying about Water-
gate?

Heinz: I talk to my colleagues
about what the constituents are
saying about it. I don't really ask
them very much about what they're
saying about it on any proiectable
basis. I have two or three friends
that I'll ask about their constitu-
ents' reactions. But they’re not a
proiectable sample.

For the most part. I think that the
general attitude of "most con-
gressmen is that they are going to
wait for the Judiciary Committee
report. then they will look atythe
findings, the evidence. and decide.

I think they won't be pushed into
saying how they're going to cast"

their vote ahead of time by
anybody, whether it's Richard
Nixon's supporters or Richard

Nixon's opponents.

‘ 0. Don’t you ever discuss what
appeared in the morning’s papers
with your colleagues over lunch? I
had the impression that Watergate
was very much the topic of
conversation in Washington.

strong executive branch as a means
of giving to that branch of
government closest to the people.

unlisual kind of vote. It's
particularly unusual that in a sense
we are not going‘ to be called upon

constituents on impeachment. We

person in history to walk out onto
the Heinz Hall stage, look around
at the ornate surroundings, and
say, “What a dump!" The line is
taken from Beyond The Forest, one
of her early ﬁlms. It wa_s

immortalized by Taylor and Burton

in their Who’s Afraid of Virginia

Although she was playing

against the televised Academy

Awards on Tuesday evening, there

i . was a large crowd gathered at

Heinz Hall for an evening of film

 I clips' from old Bette Davis movies

followed by a question-and-answer
period with the grande dame
herself.

She had no predictions for the
outcome of the Academy Awards,
because she hasn’t been seeing
many films. “I did see A Touch of
Class. I wish it would win
everything. Glenda Jackson is
going to have a long, glorious
career.” When asked about Last
Tango, she replied, “I never saw
it."

Davis will celebrate her birthday

make me feel like clapping."

She has been travelling around
the country for nearly two weeks,
speaking in a different city every
night. She doesn’t remember any
of them. “They’re sort of like a
montage before me.”

Bette Davis plays no games with
Unlike the
character she plays in Baby Jane,
she is comfortable with the passage
of time. When a member of the
audience asks for her age, she
simply tells it. A young man held
up a '30s movie magazine and told
her she hasn’t changed a bit.
“Hah! Tell him he’s a liar." Her
disarming honesty cracks through
the veneers of Hollywood Star that
inevitably surrounds her.

A member of the audience asks
which were her favorite parts and
which one would she like to do over
again. “Most of my favorite parts
were many, many years ago and
there'd be no way I could do them
again."

A master of a wide variety of
roles, she felt that as Mildred in Of
Human Bondage was the most
difficult, because of the English
accent she had to sustain and the
complexity of the character. -But
she has never become personally or
emotionally involved with a role.
“That was never true. I iust left

Women's Concert Successful 

BY DAVID SHONBERG
Last Friday night, in the Frick
Fine Arts Auditorium, the Pitt's
Women's Choral and the John
University Glee Club

presented an interesting and

vwell-prlepared program of popular

and classical music.

The Club felt noticeably more
comfortable with their popular
numbers than with their classical
selections. Their performance of

Laboratory Production

Beethoven's “Creation Hymn"
lacked control and confidence, and
therefore, not convincing. In
addition. the programming in-
cluded two iarring iuxtapositions:
the “Creation Hymn" followed by
Mancini's “Moon River", and
“Ave Maria" by Charles Gounod
followed by “Up, Up and Away."
There must be a better way to
secure contrast.

Aside from these few faults, the

Brecht's   ‘City’ Bit Rough

by ADRIAN MCCOY

The Pittsburgh Laboratory
Theatre has had the courage to
tackle a work by that bane of
actors, directors and critics--Bertolt
Brecht. Their production of In the
Jungle of Cities is a representative
example of Brecht’s ‘rough-house
theatre, with its bumpy rhythms
and harsh cold lighting.

The story involves “an inexpli-
cable boxing match” between two
men. There is no motive for this
fight. Schlink [Buffalo Bromberg],
a Malay lumber dealer in Chicago,

. throws out the challenge to a young

man named George Garga [John
Stumpf], who enters the ring
ﬁghting and quoting from Arthur
Rimbaud’s Season in Hell.

This absence of motivation is
confusing. Two men iust decide to
have it out in a metaphysical
boxing match which turns into
mere shadowboxing.

Time: 8:00 p.m.

The struggle is completed and
Garga seems to be the victor. But
the viewer is left with a question.
Has he really won anything? He is
left in the ring, as if waiting to take
on the next opponent. The only
thing he has won is another chance
to lose.

The stage is constructed to look

like a boxing ring, and the action is ,

divided into “rounds" instead of
scenes. Changes of placards and

V an annoying clanging bell mark the

progress of the Garga/Schlink
struggle. The two men gamble
everything in this contest. Schink
loses his lumber business and the
entire Garga family becomes
involved and is ultimately ,des-

girlfriend become prostitutes and
Mrs. Garga deserts her family.

There are no reasons given for any
of this, because the idea here is to

Glee Club did an admirable job.
Their robust and spirited sound
filled the small auditorium well,
and their singing was accurate,_
on-pitch, and well-articulated.
The club sang “What Shall We
Do With a Dunken Sailor" and
“Ol' King Cole" with exceptional
enthusiasm, and the audience
responded with the same. Special
credit goes to the solo bass for his
comic imitation of an army
sargeant in the latter number.
Pitt’s women’s chorus, directed
by Emily Burgess, presented an

I all-classical program freaturing

nineteenth-century song masters’,
Schubert, Mendelssoln, Dvorak,
and Brehms. The choir sang with
good intonation and sensitivity to
color and mood. Two of three
pieces from Dvorak’s “Gypsy
Songs” featured mezzo-soprano
Cynthia Kraus, whose dark voice
was well-suited to the somber
atmosphere of songs like “Here in
the Wood so Dark”.

The twentieth century was
represented by Vincent Perse-
chetti’s setting of e.e. cumming's
poem, “sam was a man", and
unusual sonorities of which the
chorus handled well.

The concert closed with Schu-
bert's ‘fStandchen” (Serenade)
performed by the chorus with
contralto, Elizabeth Walker.

Last year the choral group had
problems with intonation, but these
seem to have been ‘cleared up
considerably. If future perfor-

_mances maintain the standard set

by last week’s, the group is well
worth following.

Maimed ‘Mame'JustNotTrue

BY DREW PORVAZNIK
Mame is a very unique person.
She's a swinger, a liver and a doer

with a generous heart and a
charismatic personality. Giving
lavish parties and collecting

friends are favorite hobbies of hers.

Mame believes in living life to its
fullest extent. Her motto is “Life is
a banquet."

To her nephew Patrick, age ten,
she is the most wonderful woman
since Marv Poppins. Auntie Mame
later becomes the dominate influ-
ence throughout his young life.

She so impressed Patrick that in
later years he wrote a book about
her. In 1956, the play, Auntie
Mame, first appeared on Broad-
way. By 1958, it was made into a
movie with Rosalind Russell in the
lead. The play was revived back

Ball as the magnetic character.

The movie brings to
significant and wonderful period in
American history covering the late
20’s to the late 405 (which included
the depression and the beginnings
of the film industry). The film is
about a socialite, Mame Dennis.

‘close scrutiny today, and brings
him to bourgeois discotheques.
On another level. Mame is about

a relationship that develops be-

tween Patrick and his aunt over a
period of 20 years. Mame clutches
to dominate and control his life.
But Mame, like most parents, must
realize that a day comes where kids
must be free and independent from
the control and influence of their
parents. She refuses to believe
this. The disapproval of her
nephew's choice of abride moves
Mame to break up their romance
which results in Patrick's resent-
ment to his aunt.

Not long afterwards, Patrick, by
now in his early twenties, ﬁnds a
woman who proves acceptable to
Mame--she's Pegeen. the maid.
She becomes his wife and mother
of Peter, their "son.

The last scene takes place in
1948, 20 years after Patrick first
came into Mame’s life. At this
time, she entices little Peter to
come with her on a trip to Moscow. .
He now has replaced Patrick as the
center of Mame’s life. Just like 20
years ago, Mame similarly initiates
Peter into her free-wheeling
lifestyle. ‘

Mame is a big budget old style
Hollywood musical that, at times,
looks like a banana split. The fancy
costumes for Lucille Ball cost an
enormous $300,000. That left 699

Lucille Ball plays Mame as a

never lacking a moonface smile.
Her main drawback is that she
can’t sing. Her performance comes
off as something less than
dynamic.

The one who iniects life into the

Arthur handles the role much like

The only person capable of

in their rendering of Soviet L_a_tvian
life. A good Latvian artist is not
always one who has developed a
unique personal style. but he may
be masterfully delving further into
a style developed by one who has
preceded him.’

Perfection of the craft of an artist
is greatly sought after in Soviet
Latvia. Intense schooling and
preparation is required. and upon
completion of his art education.

necessary. for the artist to be

offered to her. “When I heard the
name of the book was Gone With
the Wind. I said, ‘l’ll bet it’s a pip.’

And walked out of the office.”

She talked about her “differ-
ences" with Erroll Flynn. who
worked with her in Elizabeth. "I
worked very hard. He didn't...He
wasn't a great actor. but he had
that charm...likje Valentino. When
I played Elizabeth. I used to sit on
my throne and pray that Laurence
Olivier would walk through the
door instead."

In All About Eve, the character
Margo is an aging. iaded actress.
Near the end of the picture, she
says something about how a
woman is always a woman first.
and a career is only secondary.
What matters most is home and
marriage. Davis agrees. “I
believe everything Margo said...l
think the most important thing is
marriage and a guy." ‘

Davis is str-ictly an actress. She
would never want to try directing.
“I'm too impatient. Ilove acting so
much I’d always want to be in there

I'd Love to Kiss you All

The inevitable question about
hopes for beginning actresses was
asked and Davis expressed the
attitude that there’s always hope.
“It depends on how much the
individual wants it. You’ve got to
want it so badly you’re willing to
sacrifice everything.” .

Davis is aware of the gap
between contemporary film and the
kind of movies she has made. “It's
not done in the same way
today...it's sort of the dungaree era
We did things differently
then because it was a different
world." When i asked -if she
thought morality would ever come
back to film, she replied. “Do you
think morality will ever come back
to the United States of America?"

She is happy with the success of
her current tour. In fact, she seems
comfortable with everything about
her life. H

“I don’t feel great. If others feel
that I am, I’m extremely grateful.
But I could never think that way
about myself.
Yankee...to be tough, even .on
myself.” Davis is the legend that
doesn’t feel like a legend.

BY M.C. PILECKI

Well. the 46th Year of Oscar has
come and gone, leaving the
members of the Academy of
Motion Picture Arts and Sciences
either dancing in the streets or
weeping and gnashing their teeth.
Whatever the case may be.
Every year since 1927, the
Academy members have gotten
together to pat each other on the
backs and decide who among them.
has done the best job

It is deﬁnitely the biggest PR
success in history." An Academy
Award, or iust the nomination,
means fatter profits and higher
prestige for a movie. Many a star’s
ailing career has been reiuvenated
by the gold statuette. Already

proven technicians find producers»

beating paths to their doors with
generous Checkbooks because of
the little gold man. For pure power,
no other film award can match the

Oscar. -
The-way the awards procedure

works is that each of the different
craft branches nominates their own

- for awards, i.e. actors vote for

actors, writers for writers, etc. The
top five vote winners in each
category are the nominees. The
entire Academy, over 3,000 mem-
bers, then votes for the final
winners, and the results are
secretly tabulated and revealed
only after the “May I have the
envelope please” routine. I
Awards night usually brings
some surprises and a few disap-
pointments for all who have
previously made up their minds.
And afterwards one chalks up how
well one’s predictions fared. and
this year I find I batted .333. (The
previously written predictions col-

umn didn‘t make it under the
deadline. in case you wonder why
you didn't see it).

I struck out when I pessimis-
tically predicted that The Exorcist
would capture Best Picture honors
and a lot of other awards. My
opinion was that the movie was
cheap sensationalism expensively
produced, a rather shoddy shocker
that had an infantile interpretation
of evil that could scare only naive
children and little old ladies who
put ﬁgxleaves on statues. The
basically conservative Academy
also disliked the film, mostly for its
overuse of repugnant violence and
crude ugliness, and were not
intimidated by its box ofﬁce power.

What really gets me mad is the
Best Foreign Picture award. Not
the winner, but the idea of having a
separate and clearly not equal
category for non-English language
films thoroughly disgusts me, and
emphasizes HolIywood’s image as

_backwoods provincials who fail to

understand what is outside of their
backyard. The year’s winner Day
For Night, with which I heartily
agree,[ .was clearly one, of the best
flicks--in any language--of the year,
but withheld from competition in
the various categories because of a
confusing rule of eligibility. It’s a
constant sorepoint that foreign
language films--including the ac-
tors and technicians--are repeat-
edly ignored. No foreign language
film has ever been Best Picture,
and only a handful of the “lesser
awards” have been bestowed
among these movies.

This year's winner, The Sting,
was one of my own preferences
(together with Cries and Whispers,

a Swedish ﬁlm)-. It was certainly an-

oranges and fig newtons. and never
sits well.

Naturally the Best Director
followed Best Picture. and I struck

' out again. presuming that William

Friedkin would cop it for The
Exorcist. My own preference was
more for Ingmar Bergman (Cries
and Whispers). than for the also
respectable winner George Roy Hill
(The Sting). V

Finally I struck my first pitch
with a choice of Jack Lemmon

(Save the Tiger) for Best Actor, an .'

award given less for the merits of
this movie than for the aging star's
greater--but unawarded--efforts in
flicks like The Apartment and
Lemmon's best. Dayd of Wine and
Roses. Tiger was totally designed
to win its star his first leading
award (he won supporting actor's

award in 1955 for Mister Roberts -

with its impassioned soliloquies
and all the dramatic possibilities of
a mental breakdown. My personal
preference was for Steve McQueen
(Papillon). who wasn't even nom-
inated.

Glenda Jackson [A Touch of
Class]! was named Best Actress,
over my reluctant prediction of The
Exorcist’s Ellen Burstyn. Jack-
son’s divorcee having an affair
seemed to me just a grown-up
Doris Day role, although done
admittedly with more subtlety and
a touch of class [sorry]. However,
female stars of this year were all
rather mundane and quite unex-
citing, and none worth mentioning

-except for the foﬁir stars of Cries

9%

   

and Whispers. all ignored in this
year’s balloting,

The Paper Ch_ase’s stern. 'hard- -

nosed law professor John House-
man won for Best Supporting Actor
(I lose again, figuring for Jason
Miller of The Exorcist, the only
actor in that ﬂick to not make a total
ass of himself). Houseman was
really little more than iust stern
and hard-nosed for his role. and

' wasn't even on camera very much.

Randy Quaid. the put upon sailor of
The Last Detail was more of my
"idea of the Best Supporting Actor.

If Linda Blair (The _Exorcist’s
little devil) had won for Best
Supporting.Actress. my idealistic

"belief in the awards would have

been gone. especially since it
seems that three actresses had -a
part in the role. and Blair herself
had very little to do. The year's
winner. ulcer-ridden Tatum
'O'Neal, -had quite a passable
performance for an eight-year-old
as the unbelievably world-wise con
artist in Paper Moon, although it's
questionable whether she did
better than Sylvia Sidney for
Summer Wishes, Winter Dreams.

I made my big score with musical

f'_;choices [and lpreferenceslx-ailong

with" Marvin Hamlisch, who won all
three awards: ;Best Song, “The
Way We Were” and Original
Dramatic Score for The Way We
Were and Best Scoring [original or
adapted] for The Sting. The huge
commercial success of both sets of
music made the winner’s choice
obvious. And in The Sting. Scott
Joplin’s music was so effectively
used to create the total mood that
due recognition was a must.

AP Coach ‘Of Year

NEW YORK AP--Norm Sloan. a
low-key boss who plays down his
role with North Carolina State’s
national championship basketball
team, was named The Associated
Press Coach of the Year today. .

The modest transplanted Hoos-

-/fér scored a runaway victory over
Marquette's Al McGuire. a man
whom Sloan beat iust as easily for
the national title.

The 47-year-old Sloan collected
81 points to 35 for McGuire in
balloting by the nation’s sports
writers and broadcasters.

Notre Dame's Dick Phelps
placed third with 24 votes,
Michigan's Johnny Orr was'fourth
with 19 and UCLA's John Wooden,
who has won this award ﬁve times,
was ﬁfth with 14.

Preaching "love" among his
players, Sloan directed the Wolf-

Pirates,
Cards In  
Opener

PITTSBURGH AP--The Pitts-
burgh Pirates, who compiled a
lackluster 10-15 spring training
record, open their National League
baseball season Friday night in St.
Louis against the Cardinals.

Jerry Reuss, one of Pittsburgh's
few pitching bright spots this
spring, will open against Bob
Gibson, the Cardinals' perennial
mainstay. -

Reuss, a 24-year-old native of St.

But he's not overly impressed
with his part in the formidable

accomplishments.
“People give coaching too much
credit," he has often said.

coachesf' ~

Sloan has mystical rapport with
his players, as well as an enormous
attachment. In his eighth season,
those ingredients have helped him
compile a 145-71 record, including
a 27-0 mark last year when the
Wolfpack was on NCAA probation
for recruiting violations.

- Prior to taking over the North
Carolina State post, Sloan coached
at Presbyterian College, /The
Citadel and Florida. His overall
coaching recordiis 358-208 and he
has won Coach of the Year honors
in three different conferences--the
Southern, Southeastern and twice
in the Atlantic Coast Conference.
He has guided the Wolfpack to
three ACC titles

,4Sloan's emergence as the na-
tion's No. 1 coach moves Wooden

least. The UCLA coach was‘named

After nearly a month's layoff, the
Pitt Tracksters are back on the
track today travelling to the
Colonial Relays at Williamsburg.
Virginia.

“This is our first competition
since the first week of March,”
said Assistant Track Coach Smittie
Brown. “The competition is going
to be tough because the Kentucky
Relays have been cut this year due
to financial troubles.

"A lot of the top eastern and

southern schools will be in Virginia

because Kentucky was dropped,"
Brown continued. “Really it was a
good thing Kentucky was cut
because we never seemed to have
good weather or times anyway."
Going to the outdoor season,
many of the tracksters look forward
to bettering their indoor times. “A

lot of the guys like running
outdoors because there's more
room to maneuver," said Brown.

“Big guys like Jack Patrick (6-2)
iust can't take corners like smaller
guys. Jack should really be able to
pour it on outside."

Basically Head Coach Jim
Banner will be staying with the
same team which did very well
during the past season. Billy Rea,
who has broken just about every
collegiate long jumping record in
his career, including first place in
the Eastern Championships and
second in the NCAA’s, will be back
hoping to begin another string ot

Myslinski Considers  

Drop From ECAC

PITTSBURGH AP-The Univer-

I sity of Pittsburgh says it may join

Penn State in dropping out of the
Eastern College Athletic Confer-
ence (ECAC). I

The ECAC was formed in 1938.
One of its primary functions is to
provide referees and ofﬁcials for
210 colleges.

Penn State already has resigned
effective July 1. State has said it
will rely on ofﬁcials from the Big
Ten Conference. Pitt may do the
same. '

“We are considering dropping
out, and if we solve the official
problem we will probably get out
right away,” Pitt Athletic Director
Casimir Myslinski said in Philadel-
phia while attending an ECAC

meeting.

"Our boardof athletics will meet
in about a month to decide."
Myslinski added. “I presume I will
recommend gettingout, but I won't
ﬁght like mad to get out."

Penn State's ma_ior gripe was
that it was paying most of the cost
for running the conference.

The ECAC taxes its members" on .

revenues from their -television
appearances. Penn State paid
about $39,000 last year and similar
amounts in previous years.

Pitt. has made a football
turnabout under Coach Johnny
Majors, and the Panthers will likely
attract future television coverage.

“It doesn't make sense to be tied
into the conference." said Myslin-
ski. “There are iust too many
people in the same pot."

Penn State was one of the
original 53 member institutions in
the ECAC. Pitt ioined shorthly
after World II.

Myslinski said he didn’t antici-
pate Pitt or Penn State affiliating
with any other conference.

“I think being totally indepen-

dent has its advantages." he said. .,~it's almost over .with_"

 

  

Smittie Brown
expected to be ready in about a
week.

The distance medley relay team
of Jack Patrick, Rick Weaver, Bob
O'Neil, and Nick Martin barely
missed qualifying at the NCAAs
and were fourth at the Easterns,
will also be at Williamsburg.

The shuttle relay team will be

‘ made up of Andre Harris who was

hampered by a pulled hamstring
for most of the indoors, freshman
sensation Jay Sharpley, Dan
Scherle, and Bill Kalthour. This
will be the ﬁrst time the hurdlers
have run together in a meet.

“The guys have been pretty
anxious to get the season started,”
said Brown. “Everyone wants to
get into the meets and see what
they can do. This is sort of our trial
period for the outdoors.

Kuhn unleashed a long, noisy
tribute to the aging super star, who
made his mark on baseball ‘with
remarkable consistency in a career
entering its 21st year. .

Aaron’s record-tying 714th
home run was hit on 3-1 pitch with
two men on base at 2:40 pm, EDT,
and failed to get into the left field
bleachers, falling instead between
the fence and the stadium wall. It
was retrieved by a member of the
Riverfront Stadium security force,
brought back to the field and
presented to Aaron by second base
umpire John McSherry after Aaron
returned to the dugout.

Ralph Garr had opened the game

with a walk and Mike Lum followed
with a single to left ﬁeld. After
Darrell Evans ﬁied out, Aaron
approached the plate to a loud
ovation. He took two balls outside,
then a called strike letter high and
then another ball before lining the
next pitch" over the fence.

His Atlanta‘ teammates poured
out of the dugout to meet him at
home plate and Aaron strolled to a
box seat beside the Atlanta dugout

' and kissed his wife Billye.

Aaron then went into the dugout
as the applause continued and
came out again when McSherry
carried the ball to him in a brown
paper bag.

The game was interrupted for six
minutes as the vice president and
commissioner came onto the field
to pay tribute to Aaron, along with
Bill Bartholomay, board chairman
of the Braves.

"Thank you very much," Aaron
said from the ﬁeld. “I'm iust glad

BY RON SIEGEL
The atmosphere at spring
football drills this year is complete-

ly different from last season, and it-

IS a, change for the better,
according to senior ‘monster’-back
Mike Bulino. '

“We didn't know how to act in
front of the coaches last year‘,'»'
recalled Bulino in the plush locker
room after a recent thunderstorm-
shortened practice: “It was all
business. We were scared to do
anything."

The locker room is not even the
same. Last year at this time, it-was
bare cement full of ladders and
plaster. Now, the players are
accustomed to theblue and gold
carpeting, and they also feel at

\ ease with the ‘coaches.

Bulino is feeling more at ease
with his position. ‘‘-I never played
‘Monster’ until last year,” he said.
“I know what I’m doing out there
now.”

A deﬁnite All-East candidate this
fall, Bulino is/almost assured of a
starting spot, barring iniury. “We
play a 5-2-monster defense. and
I’m the monster,” he said with a
big grin.

Bulino’s job security is based on
the inexperience of his competi-
tors, as well as his ability.
Felton looms as the number ‘two
‘monster’ man, and while he did
letter last year as a freshman, his

inexperience hurts him more than

anything else. -
Bulino was one of the few bright
stars on the 1-10 1972 team at a
defensive secondary position, and

pretty smoothly last year.

The ‘Monster’ is half linebacker-
half defensive back, and must be
strong as well as quick. A highlight
ﬁlm featuring Penn State's John
Cappelletti showed how good
Bulino is, as he nailed the PSU
All-American with an open-ﬁeld
ﬂying ta’ckle.

When Bulino thinks back to last
season though, it’s not the great
plays he remembers, it‘s the one
that .got away. A '

The one that got away was
Arizona State quarterback Danny
White. With Bulino and Jim
Buckmon converging on him,

White ducked behind an official,’

then uncorked ‘a desperation pass
50 yards downfield that turned into
a touchdown. That play turned the
Fiesta Bowl around, and the Sun
Devils went on to a 28-7 victory.

“I couldn't believe that play,” 1.

the St. Clair. Pa. native recalled.
“I thought he was throwing the ball
out of bounds. He said in the paper
he saw his receiver, but he couldn't
have, he was lookingat me."

’ At the start of the season, few,

people expected Pitt to ﬁnish with a
winning record. After being a part
of it. Bulino feels the Panthers
should have done better than 6-4-1.

“We should have been 9-2 last
year, but we were young and we
made a lot of mistakes. That won’t
happen this year.”

Bulino is setting his sights on a
major bowl game this year. “I
won’t say which one, but we don't
want to settle for anything less."

Asked about oyerconﬁdence, he
replied, “We had a taste of that

A PHILADELPHIA AP--The Penn
" "’ﬂ*Relays will reinstate the invita-
tional mile run at its 80th
competition April 27-28. after a 20
year absence from the annual track
and field carnival.
 Jim Tuppeny, meet director and

_..-_.-.y__...._.£ ,,. c_
.._,....».. ..

Penn track coach, said he expected
a ﬁeld of six, headed by world
indoor record holder Tony Waldrop
to start in the April 28 race at
 Franklin Field's artiﬁcial surface.
Other entries are Reggie
§_, McAfee, a former - teammate of
 Waldrop’s at North Carolina;
ii’ ?~,:Villanova's Dick Buerkle, Penn's
.5 ”- VKarl Thornton, Bruce Fisher of the
 Chicago - Track Club. and Ray
l Smedley from the University of
i Birmingham in England.
l The meet record for the Penn
l Relays mile was set in 1951, by
Roger Bannister, the Englishman
who went on to become the first
sub four minute miler. Bannister
 won 23 years ago in 4:08.3. Other
winners of the event were Fred
Wilt 1950, Denis Johansson of
[. Sweden 1952, Max Truex 1953 and
E.‘  Mal Whitefield 1954 the last time
l the race was run. They all won
i‘- over the old cinder track.

Waldrop, who lowered the world
indoor mile record to 3:55.0 at San
Diego in February, ran seven times
this winter under four minutes, a
feat never before accomplished in
track history. .

Marty Liquori, the former
Villanova mile star, holds the
Franklin Field mile record over the
artificial surface of 3254.6.
Tuppeny indicated that Liquori was
an outside possibility for the race.
Liquori may have some television
commitments that will keep him
from entering.

Thompson

Player Of The Year

George Adams, now with San
Diego of the ABA.

“I had to learn to lump high to
shoot over them," said the
two-time All-American, a mere
6-foot-4.

The 19-year-old North Carolina
State junior’s awesome leaping
ability is just one fact of his
superlative all-around play.

Thompson, who repeatedly has ‘

said he will shun pro offers until he
graduates, because “the money
will still be there," led State to as

30-1 record and the NCAA
championship last week.
Just as his team dethroned

perennial champion UCLA in the
NCAA semifinals, Thompson re-
placed the Bruins’ Bill Walton as
AP player of the year. Thompson
received the vote of 128 of the-
naiton’s sports writers and sports‘-.

. casters to 85 for the 6-foot-11

Walton. Nine other players each
got one vote.

Statistics tell. only part of the
story of his worth to Coach Norman
Sloan’s team. ln 31 games
Thompson averaged 26 points, 7.9
rebounds, shot 55% from the floor
and 75 at the foul line.

In four NCAA tournament games
heiscored 115 points, all against
nationally ranked teams.

.Counting his final year in high
school and play on the State

freshman team, Thompson-led-

teams are 117-8 for'four years.

When you stop to consider just how much calculator $49.95 usually buys. we know you'll
realize that what we have here is nothing other than a real bargain. Just one year ago, this exact
same machine soldfor $149.95. And was worth every penny of it.

While there is no "typical" $49 calculator, there are several features common to any machine:
the basic four functions—addition. subtraction, multiplication and division. Unlike the more ex-
pensive, rechargeable models, the primary power source is usually a throwaway battery. There are

other features available too, such as floating decimal, a clear

entry key, and a display with digits large enough that they can _  -" 8 '

easily be read. Check for these features before you buy any
machine, because all $49 calculators are not created equal.

An Unfair Comparison.

In any case. like we said, this machine—The RES
Mark lX«)nce sold for $149.95. A calculator produced
tor retail at $49 lust ain't in the same class. Here are

the Mark |X's basics:

Four function capacity (as above),

An exceptionally large, very easy—to-read
8—digit display.

Fu_l| floating decimal,

Combined clear and clear
entry key, and

A rechargeable battery, with AC adapter/ ,2

charger included.

By any reasonable standards, the
above qualifies the Marx lX as a grxid
$49 machine. But what made it worth a
hundred dollars more?

"You can perform both chain and ‘
mixed calculations: square a number:
calqulate reciprocals, and raise a number
to an integer power. There is a sign change

defects in parts. ’

An amendment to increase the
aid to $274 million was reiected by
a vote of 1776' to 154 despite
contentions that South Vietnam
needs it to survive.

Critics accused the Pentagon of
trying to,make an end-run around
the $1.126-billion limit on US
military aid to Saigon set by
Congress last year and stressed
they were not abandoning the
South Vietnamese.

"The American people are not in

very definite draftsmanship.
Genre scenes reﬂecting everyday
Latvian life are common, giving
particular attention to the types of
labor done by the Latvian people.

A series of wood engravings by
Peteris Upitis in the late 1950's
depict countryside scenes. “Bird
in the Gauia" and “Oaks of the
Gauia" are two woodcuts that
through their subiect matter and
delicate detail set a mood of peace
and romanticism. The works
reflect a clamness and harmony
found within nature. Several
linocuts by Gunars Krollis repre-
sent more recent work. “Bridges,"
(1966) uses a striking contrast
between black and white angular
line. The work conveys its theme
with almost poster-like clarity.

in the figures he portrays in
“Two.” Spiny silhouettes become

The linocut is also used by Dainis

Black and white bold lines curve

Another younger‘ artist, Lolita
Zikmane created feelings of depth

create a large amount of fright-, it
