Males learn about preventing sexual assaults

By Jennifer McGinnis
Staff Writer

Pitt’s Coordinator of Sexual Assault
Services, Mary Koch Ruiz, is encourag-
ing male students to plant seeds in the
minds of their peers.

Since assuming her post last
February, Ruiz has organized a group of
35 active coed peer educators. ’

These students give programs to vari-
ous student groups and lead discussions
on the causes, prevention and conse-
quences of sexual assault.

Peer educators gave an average of one
program per week last semester to
Freshman Studies classes, Office of
Residence Life groups, fraternities and
sororities during Greek 101.

“We want people to know if you’re
assaulted, you can come in (to the cen-
ter),” Ruiz said. “There are people that
can help.”  1

Though the coed peer education
program has been received with
much success, Ruiz said she feels
that men can be more open and honest
in all-male groups led by male

peer educators dealing with male
issues.

A male peer educator program is cur-
rently being organized and will be
ready for operation this summer.

One of the main goals of the
peer educator program is creating an
awareness of sexual assault on campus.
Peer educators are trained to explain
reasons why rapes and sexual assaults
occur at Pitt, ways to prevent sexual
assault from occurring and reasons why
many victims do not report their
assaults.

Peer educators also inform_ students
about the many resources Pitt’s
Counseling and Student Development
Center offers for victims of rape or sex-
ual assault.

The center offers counseling on either
the individual or group level, and Ruiz
provides victims with many advocacy
services.

These include escorting victims to the
hospital or police and helping victims
pursue judicial action through the uni-
versity or criminal action through the
district attorney’s office.

Ruiz emphasized that the male peer
educator program is not only about

sexual assault. Relationship dynamics‘

and the values and beliefs men have
toward dating and women are important
issues the peer educator programs deal
with.

“The male peer educator program is
meant to present males with an opportu-
nity to be more open about relation-
ships,” Ruiz said. “If we send male peer
educators into male groups, men may
be more comfortable.”

The relationship between male bond-
ing and peer pressure will be another
focus of the group. Part of the peer
educator’s job is to urge males to not
just accept any specific group mentali-
ty, but to think of who they are and
decide for themselves what is best, Ruiz
said.

After their selection, peer educators
must complete a semester of training
which consists of two-to-three hour
meetings once aweek.

Junior Trishul Devineni described his
training session as, “interactive group-

MOSCOW — The Russian
government is pushing for
confirmation of a U.S.-Russia
summit that is to be held in
Moscow this May.

Andrei Kozytrov, Russian
foreign minister, will bring up
the subject when he meets
with Secretary of State Warren
Christopher this week.

Relations have been strained
lately because of the U.S. sup-
port of NATO expansion plans
and the handling of the
Chechnya conflict by Russian
officials.

The Russian foreign min-
istry said that if the meetings

some five weeks of severe

ICELAND — Iceland authori-
ties reported that five people
were killed and an as many as
10 others are reported missing
after an avalanche hit a fishing
village. ‘

The avalanche was reported
to have hit 13 houses in
Sudavik, and the entire north-
western portion of the country
has been declared a danger
zone.

The five bodies were found
on Monday, and many of the
people missing were reported
to be children.

The fear of additional
avalanches has moved rescuers
to relocate survivors to
Isafjordur, the largest town
near the destruction.

The rescue effort was made
difficult by a storm developing
on the western part of the
island. Roads were also closed
due to severe blizzard condi-
tions.

Rescuers had to get to the
island by boat. —— Reuters

NEW YORK — There is an
apparent irreparable feud
between two of O.J. Simpson’s
lawyers, Robert Shapiro and
F. Lee Bailey, The New York
Times reported yesterday.

The Times said the feud is a
result of an internal investiga-
tion by William Pavelic,
Simpson’s main investigator,
into disclosures to the media.

According to the Times,
Pavelic reported to Simpson
that Bailey and his associates
systematically disclosed infor-
mation to the press.

The object, according to
Pavelic, was to denigrate
Shapiro’s credibility and
enhance Bailey’s own standing
in the case.

The feud will be left
to Jonnie Cochran, the
third member of the de-
fense team, to resolve. —

hours at a time like the Beehive
does, but customers can browse

darkly roasted powdered coffee beans.

Cappuccino: Espresso with foamed and steamed milk.

Mocha: Espresso with steamed milk and chocolate syrup.

Latte: Espresso with steamed milk.

Other highlights include an
array of vegetarian specials and
tempting desserts like “choco-

The Greenhouse Cafe

Workers spent ﬁve and a half
weeks just before Thanksgiving
last year transforming an old
flowershop into one of the
newest Coffeehouses in the
area.

“They were here all day. It
was constant. We were here til
4 in the morning,” said manag-
er Stephanie Meyer, a Pitt grad-
uate.

The result is a cafe that gives
customers glimpses of various
moods.

A customer walks through a
gate into awarm and fresh
glass-enclosed area filled with
plants.

After climbing the steps and

passing by the service counter,
customers enter a seating area
that emits coziness and comfort
with a fireplace, a large bay
window, hardwood ﬂoors and
soft lights.

At the Greenhouse, many
students come to study and to
speak French, Meyer said.

An entire French conversa-.

tion class volleyed their knowl-
edge of the language at each
other while drinking coffee.
»“We’re more like a sit down
and hang out and bring all your
friends place,” said Amy
George, who has worked there
since it opened last November.
Meyer said the quiet atmos-
phere welcomes and encour-
ages customers to spend as
many hours as they want in the
cafe.
* Customers favor the latte,
according to Meyer, but anoth-
er notable specialty beverage is
the ski slope — steamed milk,
vanilla syrup, white chocolate
shavings and whipped cream.
Prices of the coffee and.other

beverages range from $.70 to
$2.25.

Located in Shadyside on Ivy
Street right off of Walnut
Street, the cafe also offers an
assortment of deli sandwiches,
soups du jour and salads.

Its hours are from 7 to 1 a.m.
Sunday through Thursday and
7 to 3 a.m. Friday and
Saturday.

Barnes and Noble Cafe

At Barnes and Noble, cus-
tomers can weave through
aisles and aisles of books and
magazines while drinking their
coffee. Couches and chairs
interspersed throughout the
store welcome browsers who
have bumped into a title worth
sitting down for.

Drawings of a wide range of
authors loom on the walls
above the book aisles. John
Grisham and William
Shakespeare hang very close to
one another.

Located inside Squirrel Hill’s
Barnes and Noble bookstore,
the cafe features Starbucks

Coffee Co. Customers can take
books, magazines or newspa-
pers into the cafe area, which is
set apart from the aisles of
books on the second ﬂoor.
Customers often sit in the
area and read, said Rebecca
Glupczynski, who has worked

-there since its opening in

November.

“They keep getting coffee for
hours,” she said.

Since the bookstore sits next
to the Manor movie theater,
Saturday night movie crowds
often spill over into the cafe
around 10 p.m. to drink coffee
and indulge in a dessert,
Glupczynski said.

Prices of the coffee and spe-
cialty drinks range from $1 for
a small house coffee to $2.75
for a large cafe mocha or cafe
breve. The cafe also features
sandwiches, soups and pastries.
Barnes and Noble is open every
day from 9 a.m. to 11 p.m.

The retreat, along with last
Wednesday’s inauguration ceremony for
new board members marked the official
start of the board’s term. With the transi-
tion out of the way, and the past cam-
paign little more than a memory,
Crowell said she is ready to see some
action from this year’s board.

“Campaign promises are one thing,
but what you actually plan to do as a
board member is another thing,”
Crowell said. “I was really impressed
with the ideas some of the board mem-
bers came up with.”

Governmental Relations Committee,
said_the weekend served as an “educa-
tional” and “informative” experience for
him. He said the retreat gave board
members their first opportunity to work
together as a ur1it.

“I got to see my fellow board mem-
bers on a personal level,” Campbell
said. “It’s the first time we got to work
together as a team.”

According to Campbell, Crowell and
Pasquale analyzed the board members’
goals and assisted them by discussing
what they had done in the past on cer-
tain issues. .

He said the new board’s key to
achieving its goals is knowing who to
contact within Pitt’s administrative

  

ranks so students’ concerns can be acted
upon. _
“Right now, half the job is knowing
who to go to [to accomplish goals],”
Campbell said. “We know what we want
to do, we just need to know where to

go.

Campbell said. Vice Chancellor for
Student and Public Affairs Leon Haley,
Assistant Vice Chancellor Dennis
Donham, and Joe Cavalla and Terry
Milani of the Office of Student
Activities also spoke to the board about
goal-setting.

He also said Pasquale, who served on
the 1992 board as a member before
becoming president, was able to help the
board through his broad knowledge in

dealing with university officials.

“Ross is like a walking Rolodex,”
Callahan said. “He has just about every
contact in the university.”

Pasquale, who along with Shepard
helped board members with their indi-
vidual goal-setting, said he is optimistic
about what this year’s board can accom-
plish.

“I think the board was able to set
some definitive, concrete goals,”
Pasquale said. “I think the first month in
office is extra important to the way the
year is going to go.”

Although it has long since faded from the front pages and
thus the public eye, the United States occupation of Haiti is
not yet over. It may soon be, however, as the nation building

continues and a major Clinton foreign policy success is being

ignored.

According to a report by the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, the
Pentagon has drawn up plans to remove most of the 8,000
US. soldiers currently in Haiti. The United Nations will take
over the remainder of the operation, with a contingent force
of 6,000 men. Half of the multinational force will be
American soldiers, and the entire operation will be under the
command of a U.S. major general.

The situation in Haiti has stabilized, and a large U.S. pres-
ence is no longer required. By intervening, the ,U.S. forces
have halted the rampant human rights abuses and dismantled
the government-sponsored squads of terrorists. Petty crime
has increased, but the Haitian government is no longer spon-
soring the sharpening of machetes to hack to death its citi-
zens.’

As the United Nations force prepares to take control, it is
faced with a smaller, internationally trained Haitian police
force. This should make the transition period les.s painful, but
now the United Nations and the United States along with it
must be watchful that things do not degenerate after the with-
drawal of the bulk of U.S. forces is complete.

Jean Bertrand Aristide was returned because he was elected
to his post. He also pledged to leave at the next election and
allow a new, democratically elected president take his place.
One dictator must not be exchanged for another. ~

In addition, the country itself suffered greatly under the
military rule of Gen. Cedras. Nation building will require
more than just a competent police force. While the process of
nation building is often decried, it is in the best interest of the
Western Hemisphere to see that Haiti is made into a strong
democracy. _

The Haitian environment and infrastructure have suffered.
Foreign investment and guaranteed loans, similar to those
which have received bipartisan support for Mexico, should be
extended to Haiti.

The lessons learned from this successful operation should
be applied to any future attempts which aim to be successful
in restoring hope. Popular support of the residents of the
nation and a pre-existing democracy were keys to the Haitian
success. The resolve of the United States must also be con-
comitant to any commitment of U.S. forces. These elements
were conspicuously lacking in the Somalian filibuster,
“Operation Restore Hope.’

Diplomatic action before sending troops also lent legitima-
cy to the operation. When the lawyers were gone, then the
proper force was used. Now the guns are leaving, the money
must be sent to make the success complete.

Keychain not a threat to humanity

ﬁrhe British have the right
idea when it comes to
the police. In England,
police officers are referred to
as “bobbies,” and they carry
nightsticks. Here in the United
States, if you call a police offi-
cer “Bobby,” he or she may
pull out his or her loaded gun
and shoot you.

I don’t mean to say that the
typical American police offi-
cer is exceptionally violent
and psychotic; that descrip-
tion belongs instead to the
typical American postal
worker. No, I merely observe
that we Americans as a whole
tend to feel that bigger is bet-
ter. Just look at our salaries,
our houses, our national debt,
our porn stars: we want big.

Therefore, we have big
police officers who eat big
doughnuts. No, just kidding
—— what I meant to say was
that we have big police offi-
cers who carry big guns" and,
as a result, get big egos. Not
all of them, mind you; there
are still some terrific cops out
there who remember that the
motto is “protect and serve,”
not “harass and maim.”
However, a large percentage
of the police population
seems to have a disturbingly
high attitude-to-brain ratio.

For example, about two
months ago, I was in the
Pittsburgh “We’re As Good
As LaGuardia,_ Dammit”
Airport preparing to go home
for a nice, quiet Thanksgiving
with my family. Naturally,
when I came to the security
gate, I took my keys out of
my pocket and gave them to
the security guard so they
wouldn’t set off the metal
detector.

As I walked through the
detector in blissful ignorance,
the guard looked at my keys
and reached for a telephone.
Thirty seconds later, there

was one airport policeman on
my right and another on my

left. “That is a prohibited‘

9)

weapon, one of them said
bleakly as he pointed at my
keychain. “You’ll have to
come with us.” I collected my
thoughts, drew upon all my
powers of eloquence, and
said “Huh?”

My keychain — a present
from my ever—so-helpful
mother — was a four—inch
long miniature replica of a
blackjack. In theory, it was a
defense against muggers. In
actuality, one would be hard
pressed to fight off a squirrel
with it. I kept it mostly for
amusement value, since peo-
ple generally took one look at
it and laughed themselves
silly.

However, from the way the
police reacted to it, it might
as well have been an Uzi. I
was marched down to the air-
port police sub-station, where
I was" asked my social securi-
ty number, my name, my des-
tination, my social security
number, whether I was travel-
ing with anyone, what I had
for breakfast, my social secu-
rity number and so on and so
forth for about 15 minutes.

Finally, the cop glared at
me. “I believe you didn’t
know this prohibited weapon
was prohibited,” he grum-
bled, “so I’ll give you a
choice: you can voluntarily
surrender it to me of your
own free will so I can take it
away and have it destroyed,
or you can refuse to give it to
me, in which case I’ll arrest
you and take it anyway.”

Now, at this point, there
were several things that
should have occurred to'the
cop:

1. What he was offering me
wasn't a “choice,” unless you
think a bank robber is offer-
ing any real choice when he

says, “Give me the money or
I’ll blow your head off.”

2. Was I really likely to be
a terrorist, considering that I
had casually given the key-
chain to the security guard
myself?

3. For Gods sake, how do
you hijack an airplane with a
blunt object? I can only
assume the cop thought I
might get on the plane, wait
until it was airborne, then
jump out of my seat, run
madly down the aisle and bop
the pilot on the head with my
keychain while cackling
fiendishly. But, if I wanted to
do that, couldn’t I have used
one of a thousand innocent-
looking blunt objects?

I won’t go so far as to say
that I was given a hard time
because I have long hair and
a beard, but cops have been
known to do stupid things
because they don’t like the
way someone looks. Just last
week, a group of Philadelphia
policemen were accused of
beating a black female plain-
clothes police officer.
Apparently, they arrived at a
crime scene, saw her, figured
she was a criminal and started
throwing punches. Little
things that one would think
might give them reason to
stop — such as her statement,
“I’m a police officer!” —
were more or less (OK, total-
ly) ignored as they continued
to pummel her.

I was raised to see police
officers as heroic guardians
of humanity, and I firmly
believe that this is what they
should and can be. But don’t
you think we should make
sure they know that? Next
time, they might decide
YOUR keychain looks suspi-
cious.

°Speaking of the 49ers, head

that his players do not bathe

The lockout ending when it
did only certified that all
major sports leagues are run
by one individual; my guess is
some sick mind like George
Steinbrenner. The hockey
lockout ends and play begins
just as the NFL playoffs are '
coming to an end. Hockey will
end just in time for baseball to
make its comeback, and by the
time baseball is over, if it ever
starts, football will be back
again. It's all a vicious cycle
for the all—around sports fan. If

No. 8 Syracuse
65-63 at Arena

By Tom Schneider
Staff Writer

    

If the first 12 games of the 1994-95
season have taught anything to Pitt bas-
ketball fans, it would have to be that
hell is embodied in the close games
which cannot be won.

Saturday’s 65-63 loss to No. 8
Syracuse at the Civic Arena did well to
reaffirm that notion, as well as add an
important new wrinkle.

The devil is a horrible, vicious, sav-
age creature that wears black and white
stripes.

Alas, blown calls is not yet an official
NCAA statistic, and a
loss still mounts up to
 a loss.

“I’m not gonna fool
anybody,” Pitt head
coach Ralph Willard
said. “I can’t kid the

kids and I can’t kid myself. This is not
easy.

“I try to remember all the positives
from every game, but you start to won-
der, when will you come up with
enough positives to get you over the
hump?”

we know how good we can be,” Pitt

At halftime of Saturday’s
women’s game, Panther
point guard Carol Morton
told coach Kirk Bruce that
the team had to get tougher.

Bruce replied by saying,
“You go out and get tough,
and everyone else will do the
same.”

Morton and the rest of the
Lady Panthers apparently
took that advice to heart as
they overcame a seven—point
halftime deficit to defeat
Boston College 71-63 in
conference play.

“We had to get motivated,”
Morton said. “We were a lit-
tle down after our loss to
Seton Hall, and it showed on
the court. Sometimes we just
cruise, and it showed in the
first half.”

Luckily for the Panthers,
they woke up in the second

Miles scored 14 points in

With Pitt down 36-33,
Miles came up with a steal
and a breakaway layup that

brought Pitt within one.

The Lady Panthers took the
lead when Farrah Woods
powered her way inside for a
bucket after bobbling the ball
and almost losing it to a BC

defender.

After a BC bucket tied the
contest, Miles helped keep

team fin is es third
at Blue-Gold Cup

By Ed Ziegenfuss
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s gymnas-
tics team opened its season
on Saturday night with a
third-place finish in the
Blue-Gold Cup.

For the fourth consecutive
year, the winner was the
University of Michigan with
a team score of 189.65. West
Virginia (l85.525) finished
second and Pitt (181.90)
placed third.

“I have mixed emotions,”
head coach Debbie Yohman
said. “We opened up so
much better than last year. I
saw some really exciting
things that I didn't expect to
see.”

In the all-around competi-
tion, Michigan swept the top
two spots. In first -place was
freshman Heather Kabnick
who scored 38.725. Behind
her was teammate Kelly
Carfora (38.5). In third was
Lady Panther co-captain
Brenda Stevens. She scored
38.15, which is the highest
all-around score of her
career. Her score was also
good enough to tie for fourth
place on Pitt’s all-time all-
around scores list.

“I’m really happy about
it,” Stevens said of her per-
formance.

Pitt’s other two all-
arounders were Robyn
Senior (36.475) and Lori
Buck (34.55).

On the vault, Michigan
took the top three spots, with
Wendy Marshall leading the
way with a 9.9. Kabnick
(9.8) placed second and
Andrea McDonald (9.75) fin-
ished third. For the Lady
Panthers, Mikie Myers (9.5),
Stevens (9.4) and Christine
Battista (9.35) led the way.

In the uneven bars compe-
tition, Michigan took two out
of the top three spots.
Carfora (9.625) won the
event. Stevens (9.6) finished
second for Pitt and Marshall
(9.575) took third for
Michigan.

On the balance beam it was
once again Michigan leading
the way. Kabnick (9.725) and
Carfora (9.650) finished one-
two, with Stevens (9.6) tak-
ing third. Also for Pitt,
Myers had a 9.350.

The ﬂoor exercise compe-
tition finished the same as
the other three events, with
Michigan showing the way.
Kabnick (9.875) finished
first and Carfora (9.775)
placed third. In between the
two Michigan gymnasts was
WVU’s _ Kristin
Quackenbush, who scored
9.825. The two leading scor-
ers for the Lady Panthers
were Stevens (9.550) and
Senior (9.5). ,

“We had a tremendous
warm-up,” Yohman said.
“We lost it a little bit in the
meet. I think all of it was
nerves. We had a lot of fresh-
men competing that haven’t
competed in events like this
before.”

and McElhinny received 8.75 for her
performance.

Bond also competed in the balance
beam (9.050) and the floor exercise
(8.7). Joining Bond in the ﬂoor compe-
tition was Calli Bodnar, who scored
9.00.

“They [freshmen] didn’t do badly,”
Yohman said. “A little cautious, a little
shaky here and there, a little rushed was
mostly what it was. I think we will get
over that.”

The Blue-Gold Cup was some of the
best competition that the Lady Panthers
will see this season. Michigan is ranked
fourth in the nation and competed with-
out its best gymnast, Beth Wymer, who
is out with an injury.

“A tough schedule can be frustrating,”
Stevens said. ~‘

“It’s a challenge, and that is always
goodf’ '

“Its a good meet to build on,”
Yohman said. “We are going to do some
building, and the kids know it.”

forward Orlando Antigua
said.

“We’ve played the top
three teams in the confer-
ence really close, and
it’s only a matter of time
before we finally get it
together.”

Trailing by four points
with 9.7 seconds remaining,
the Panthers were intrigued,
along with the 10,746 in
attendance, to find a very
physical Syracuse team tak-
ing more than its fair share
of liberties as Pitt point
guard Andre Alridge led the
rush downcourt.

Finally, as Alridge went up
for a long range three—point-
er with 0.7 seconds left, he
was mugged by Orangeman
Lawrence Moten, sending
Alridge to the stripe for
three shots.

Alridge made the first
two, then purposely clanked
the third off the back of
the rim, hoping for a Panther
rebound and quick bucket.

The ball was pulled in by
guard Ga_rrick Thomas, who
had his shot swatted by

°Fr0mpage 10
Syracuse forward Lucious
Jackson on a play that was
questioned heavily after-
ward. _

Unfortunately, hindsight
is always 20/20, butvthe
eye of the scoreboard never
lies.

What the scoreboard saw
was Pitt’s fifth loss by five
points or less.

“lt’s very discouraging to
know that we were in the
game-against Georgetown,
Syracuse and Connecticut,”
Pitt head coach Ralph
Willard said.

“We’re so hindered [by a
shortage of players]. We’d
like to press and get
after you all game, but we
can’t.

“We really played as
well in the first half as I
can ever imagine us playing
down here,” Syracuse
head coach Jim Boeheim
said. “In the second half, we
hesitated against traps
instead of attacking.
[Pitt] started making some
threes, and we started
turning the ball over.
Whenever you start doing
that, [the game] is going
to come right down to the
end.”

In keeping a common
theme with several other
losses this season, this game
involved a different Panther
team in each half.

After a first half in which
they were totally outhustled
and outmuscled, the Panthers
went to the locker room
trailing Syracuse 36-21
and desperately in need of a
new defensive philosophy. I

When the teams came onto
the floor again, it was the
Orangemen who found them-
selves on the run. '

The Panther defensive
traps which were inef-
fective during the initial
20 minutes now had
Syracuse falling back on
their heels, and they set the
stage for an astonishing

comeback.

Led by guard Sotiris
Aggelou’s career-high 17
points on 7-for-12 shooting,
the Panther aerial ambush
methodically whittled away
at a Syracuse lead which had
grown to 19 points just under
two minutes into the second
half.

On the strength of six sec-
ond half three—pointers, the
Panthers slowly climbed
their way out of a seemingly
inescapable hole. After a trey
by Alridge cut the
Orangemen lead to just three
at 59-56 with 1:52 remain-
ing, Pitt had both momentum
and a rejuvenated crowd on
their side.

Unfortunately, teams like
the Orangemen feed off of
situations like that. This day
was no different. 8

Syracuse headed back up
the floor, looking to cushion
its rapidly disintegrating
lead.

A critical offensive
rebound and put—back by
Jackson turned it into a two-
possession game with just
1:28 remaining.

Predictably, it turned out to
be insurmountable.

“There were a lot of tears
in the locker room after this
game,” Willard said. “It’s
been an emotional week for
us. I just hope the kids can
stay positive.”

-From page 8
three-pointers, the first from
the right side and the second
over two sprawling defend-
ers. Pitt led 53-48, and BC
never got closer than three
the rest of the way as the
Lady Panthers improved to
10-4.

Miles came into the contest
averaging only a shade over
six minutes a game in con-
ference play. She was aver-
aging 2.3 points a game for
the season.

“She had a big-time
effort,” Bruce said. “She had
some nice plays. It doesn’t
surprise me the way she
played.

“We got something out of
everybody today.” '

Eleven of the 12 players
who saw minutes scored, as
the Pitt bench outscored
BC’s, 24-14.

“We have a number of
players who can come in and
help us,” Morton said, “And
it seems like everybody did
what they had to.”

And on this day, Morton
did more than the average
point guard has to do.

She finished the game with
16 points, 10 rebounds and
nine steals, just one steal
short of a triple-double.

Three times during the
game, Morton stole the ball
at midcourt, from three dif-
ferent BC guards.

All three steals led to
Panther points.

“They got a little careless
and I took advantage,” she
said. “I’d get a little touch
and it would lead to a layup.”

“She just wears you
down,” Bruce said. “Carol’s
tough.”

Another player who was
tough Saturday was BC’s
Holly Porter. Porter was
largely responsible for
the seven-point cushion
that her team enjoyed at the
half, as she poured in 13
points.

She finished the game with
22 points as she kept the
Eagles close with a variety of
strong inside moves and soft,
short-range jumpers.

“She is a very strong,
physical player,” Morton
said. “We had to be very
careful with her because the
officials were calling the
game close.”

The Panthers also won
with a sub—par game by
Joyce, the team’s leading
scorer. ~

She was 0-7 from the field

at halftime, which was part
of the reason why Pitt was
shooting 28 percent. Joyce,
along with the rest of
the team, improved in the
second half, as they shot 47
percent.

She finished the game with
10 points, six below her
average.

“J enine might not be shoot-
ing the ball well, but she

never plays bad,” Bruce said.

“I thought that she came
back really well in the sec-
ond half.”

Next for the Lady Panthers
is Providence, Wednesday
night at the Field House.

“They are like most Big
East teams, very physical
and they will shoot threes,”
Morton said.“It should be a
tough game.”
