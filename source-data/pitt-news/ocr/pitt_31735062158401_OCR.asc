There will be a Credit system ‘more organized due to the coordi-

nating efforts of the Student

led by Bob DiCicco and Midge

Stanborough. Dr. John Geise, as- '

sistant chancellor for student af-
fairs, gave the studentshis official
nod; and accelerated by the ar-
rival of the Pitt band, the cheer-
ing and chanting continued.

In an interview recorded by
the Student Broadcasting Asso-
ciation, Dr. Geise stated, “This
affair this morning is the sort
of an affair we like, the kind of
affair we want. We will cele-
brate now, get it out of our sys-
tems, then we’ll go back to

Geise added, “There will be no
disciplinary action taken against
the students for this spontaneous
celebration of something that de-
serves to be celebrated.”

When the demonstration be-

'came too big for the Student

Union“ facilities to handle, the en-
tire celebration was moved to
Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Memorial

Hall. An estimated 3000 students 7

packed the Hall. .

The band added to the color
of the "rally with impromptu
renditions of “Hail to Pitt" and

Registration Failihgs . . .. V

 Insult to

By Paul Foreman

Our registration procedure has supposedly been
improved recently. Under the latest system stu-
dents are scheduled for registration according-to
alphabetical order. To insure  ‘
fairness, the brder is circulated
every semester. . "

It all seems very fair and
just until one realizes that under:
this. system upperclassmen must
compete on an ‘even basis with
freshmen and sophomores for
obtaining classcards. The fresh-
men have four years to complete
their required curriculum while Br -. ‘
the seniors have just a semester or two. 7 .

\

To add insult‘ to injury, the University has
started a _pre-registration program that for the.

time being is just‘ extended to freshmen and
sophomores. Eventually this - program will be
broadened to include upperclassmen, but at pres-
ent the class of ’59 and" ’60 ﬁnd that their precious
class cards, so necessaryfor graduation, have been
devoured by freshmen and sophomores. I

Upperclassmen at Disadvantage V ‘
It seems that the upperclassmen are not getting
the preferential treatment to 'which’they are en-
titled. 0‘ , ' ‘
If this new pre-registration system was a bene-

ii ﬁt to the students, it ‘would be justiﬁed to ask
— the classes of ’59 ,and ’60 to act as martyrs. The

fact is that this system insults the maturity of the
students. - '

Students report to their advisor who helps them
choose their ‘courses. This in itself is a fine prac-
tice, but the two glaring faults are that students
are not permitted‘ to pick their schedules or in-
structors. . ’ g

The disadvantages of not being able to pick
your schedule_ are obvious.’ .

—The real insult is in not being able to pick in-

. structors. It seems the administrationfears that

the students pick too 'many “easy” instructors.
They fail to recognize that a well liked in-
structor; is not necessarily an easy one. The stu-

.-2.  ',_,_~. -- .
4‘ \ . -I - I

' ‘  ‘ o 
I dents are treated like high school children whose
like or dislike for their teachers varies with the
amount of work required.

Most students? pick instructors whom they re-
spect and admire, not because they are easy, but
because they provide the ﬁnest instruction in the
particular course. The majority of the students
should not be dragged down to a high,school level
for ‘the beneﬁt of a few “children.” ’

’Let the Students Choose A « g V

People are paying for these courses. They cer-
tainly should be’ allowed to pick the instructors
who will give them the most for their money.
There isno justification for the present pre—regis-
tration system. 0

When the student, by some \miracle, manages
to secure‘ a satisfactory schedule, he sometimes
ﬁnds himself faced with an even worse plight. On
the _door of one of the classrooms a notice is

posted that informs him that his section has been

changed to a new time and day. \

This" usually completely disrupts his schedule
and forces him to go through the complicated task
of transferring classes. His problem is a mere
triﬂe compared to that of'the seniorxwho ﬁnds
that the change makes it impossible for him to
schedule‘ a class whose credits are required for
graduation.  .

In relation to dropping ‘classes, if a student
drops a course after just attending one session, he
only receives the refund of eighty percent of his
tuition. Each subsequent attendance further re-
duces the amount of refund. Thus, the student
must pay for partial attendance‘ in a course for
which he receives no credit.

I do not want to give the impression that ogr
administration bears the semblance of some mythi-

cal ogre.'The administration has set up a vastly’

improved system that has brought much_respect
to the university. However there are many ﬂaws
like those mentioned above that must be. corrected.
There is only one road to correction. The stu-
dents must realize that these‘ things vitally affect
them. They must band together and demand an
0 explanation of these failings. .Where changes are
justiﬁed, changes must be made.

Members of the Pitt News staff bore up admirably un-7
der‘ the increased strain of working three days a week in- _
stead of two. It would "be quite feasable from a staff ‘stand-

But, because of the ﬁnancial problems, the only recourse
the newspaper has is to switch back to publication on Mon-
days and Wednesdays. C '’ -

We would welcome comment from the student body,

reader’s standpoint the experiment in larger coverage and
better communication has been.  I ‘ '

We would hope that eventually suﬂicient fundsvwill be
available from the University to permit publication even
more often than three times a week.

News, Wednesday, November‘5,
(Stagnation or Evolution) I feel
that more emphasis could have
been placed on the lack of power
of the Student Government As-
sociation. This lack of power
seems to be directly attributable
to the disinterest of the admini-

stration toward student govern- 0

ing organizations.

It seeins that the administra-
tion makes quite sure that it has
nothing whatsoever to do with
student affairs as far as anything
of a Cathedral-shaking nature is
concerned.

The administration is so aloof,
in fact, that if any student initi-
ated plan for change of Uni-
versity policy isbrought to them,
it _appears to take one of two
channels.

Either. the plan is ignored

completely, or the matter is sub-
mitted to higher officials (whom
the students are not allowed to
see except a_t convocations), and
by and by the word drifts down
from the sanctiim sanctorum. The
“word,” of course, is NO, or, as
is usually the case, words to that
effect.
‘ I cite, for example, the case of
the student operated radio sta-
tion. Two years ago, a commit-
tee was set up by Student Con-
gress (the forerunnerof SGA)
to investigate the practicability
of such a radio station on cam-
pus. This committee went to'con-
siderable expense in checking
with. other college radio instal-
lations, manufacturers of trans-
mitting equipment, and even the
Federal Communications Com-
mission. H ,

After a great deal of time and
effort they submitted to the ad_-

, . ministration. a ;favorable report,
* augmented by

a lengthy student
. tati 1,1‘ ‘ ' e- d

     

pointment and served to dis-
courage_Student Congress from
doing much of anything aside
from forming committees to ap-
point chairmen to other commit-
teeshwhose function is to in-
vestigate. the feasibility of car
pools. '

True, the University is now,
two years later, considering the
building of a radio station. The
initiators of this idea,‘ however,
have long since "been graduated,

and, with_all due apologies to,

those who are now working for
a campus radio, the damage has
already been done.

Another «example of ‘the nega-
tivism of the administration to-
ward student affairs is the death
of the PITT WIT. This was a
humor magazine which was the
most successful student magazine
since the PITT PANTHER.-

The PITT WIT published. one
‘issue and then dissolved for var-
ious reasons, one of which ,was,
that the administration ‘turned
thumbs down in favor of a lit-
erary. magazine. Undoubtedly,
they want a literary magazine to
supplement our small, but quaint,
‘library. ‘

These, I think, are partial rea-
sons for the, general student dis-
interest in activities in general
and SGA in particular.

I would like to seevthe admin-
istration come down to the stu-
dent" level more “oftenf and, if
nothing else, pretend that they
are interested in the student and
student activities.

.It seems to me that good stu-
dent-administration r e 1 a t i 0 ns
will not affect our eligibility to

the Harvard-like category.

Owl gives the staff a, welcome
chance to say that they have
hoped formore University sup-
port for many years. ,

Every year since 1952, the Owl '

has presented the Publication
Board with a plan by which all
students would receive a copy of
the Owl.in connection with a
Student Activities fee. The plan
has always passed the Board, but
has not been accepted for one
reason or another by the admini-
stration. ~

The Owl staff receives $1500
from the University. This amount

.pays for pag_es_d‘evoted to gen-’__._
eral information about student "

life. '

The staff assumes the role of

publisher in order to'have a
more complete" record of the
year’s events in every phase of
University life.
' To publish this book,vthe O/wl
operates on a budget of appro-
ximately $20,000, a sum which is
closely controlled in order to be
able to produce the 1500 books
needed to supply the present stu-
dent demand.

In other words the staff has
to ‘raise $18,500 so that students
may have a yearbook. This is
done in part by means of adver-
tising, and by having organiza-
tions that are pictured in the
book pay their share in making
the year's record complete.

If 8,000 copies of the Owl
could be sold either to individual
students, or provided to the stu-
dents by means of a student ac-
tivities fund, the cost to the stu-
dent would be much less than the
present $6.00 cost of the 360
page book. _ -

Nolfre‘l5ame and
A Doubleheader .

By DAVID BREAKSTONE

I stand refuted, in a sense. My contention that lack of
student support was responsible for the Panthers’ three near-
misses was both conﬁrmed and denied by the events of Sat-
urday afternoon and Monday morning.

The game on Saturday found the student section in con-
siderably better voice and spirits than for any of the previous

' three home games. Perhaps this was due in part to the threat
posed by Notre Dame’s unoﬁicial alumni, who in the past
have set up a partisan howl audible even in Punxsutawney.

V _ Additionally, the over-zealous exhortation in this column
could have persuaded a half-dozen or so more students to
turn out and see for themselves just how many “section sev-
ens” were playing the undergraduate role for the afternoon.
Naturally, the hoop-la created by the press and the com
munications boys wherever and whenever N otre Dame plays

. ,-lures the curious to view directly the wunderkind ‘of South

«.’»‘»l3end.

On the ‘debit portion of the ledger: ﬁrst, the student sec-
‘ tion was the only visible part of the Stadium not compltely
ﬁlled. Surely not more than 65 per cent of the undergraduate
population was at the game. (It is comforting to hypothesize
that the remaining 35 per cent watc-hed the exciting spectacle
in the comfort and solemnity provided by the television
screen.) _ ' S .

. Secondly, the wild screaming by the cheering section -did
not get into high gear until w-ell into the second half. There
is no intention here to accuse anyone of fair weather friend-
ship, -but the questions hangs ﬁre as to Whether the big win is
always necessary to heat uphibernating loyalty. Perhaps,
man, by nature, needs an impressive reason to make him
react to any situation outside ‘of his own being.

_ But close to.;4 o’clock on Saturday afternoon, Will ‘Kal-
iden displayed his calm assurancexand won the game which
only the most devoted thoughtwe could win. The goal posts

, were dismantled with dispatch (another “ﬁrst” for this sea-
son) and the crowd slithering down DeSoto Street was noisy
and gay, ﬂushed with a classic victory. The “whys” and
analyses would wait until Monday, at the earliest. ,

But a . rambunctious handful of engineers decided to
keep the celebrationaﬁamewith an unsanctioned rally whose
main function WAS _a tribute to, the team, and not an evil
way of avoiding Monday morning quizzes. Setting, up the
howl at 9 o’clock in the morning in the Commons Room, the
movement gained steam haltingly. _ .0

Notable for the lack of direction, the students moved
from the Cathedral to the Union to Soldiers’ and Sailors’
with gleeful abandon, ignoring the wet and cold’ winds. The
situation in the ugly hall was all the more unorthodox be-
cause it waslthe players who saluted the players, not the stu-

dents doing the honors. Somehow, though, it was ﬁtting for
them to be making" their own tribute afterlhaving gone neg-

__lected for so long. The 1000 students‘ who took their chances »
U with unpatriotic cuts responded to the occasion with sustain-

ed enthusiasm and noise. It was a demonstration worthy of

_ the most “gung-ho” Big Ten school.

Despite the gripes of offended professors, the comments

‘lrof the city police, and the condescension displayed by the

more reserved and dispeptic of the student body, Monday

.morning was a "good blast, “The realists” doubtedlthat our

partisans" could ever get worked up so emphatically with
pride. But they were wrong and we hope we were wrong
when we said that the students don’t back their institution.

? Time will decide whether the pride can be sustained.

the Penn State game with. a sixth
victory to their credit.
’ The Cornhuskers have ‘a 2-6
record. They have, lost ﬁve
straight with one of these defeats
being a 38-0 loss to Syracuse.

While the «Yogis performed

trio came up with a 10-3-record,
which isn’t too bad at all.

Perhaps the biggest news of
all is the daring feat pulled off
by the Yogis this past week.

‘Tearn ‘ Better Than Expected;

Says Cecconi of Fresh Squad 1. 

By JACK

For Coach Lou Cecconi and his frosh gridders the,foot-  I
ball season is over, and according to Cecconi it was a success- ~

SlVIITH

ful one. “The team worked out better than expected,” said
Cecconi, ‘who himself was a freshman as a college coach.

Last week’s ‘overwhelming 40-0 victory over Kent State -

gave the yearlings an even record of 2-2 for the season. Their

other win. came over West Vii--¢
ginia while they lost to Navy and
Penn State. . -

‘W hen asked what players he
thought would be outstanding can-
«. didates for next

year.’s varsity,
- Cgcconi replied,
“I feel that John

M W o ody I-Iazer,
_ and Andy Kuz-
’  neski should see
 some action
with the Varsity.
“I am most surprised this sea-
son with the outstanding play of
center Kuzneski. This boy had
the least recognition coming to
this school but" has played the
most consistent ball throughout

  

Cecconi

the season. ~ He has the desire

and heart that makes a good
ballplayer.’’ ‘"
In the backﬁeld Cecconi pointed
to Frank Script, Glen Mosser, Mike
Frasca,'Ed Clark and John Yac-
cino as outstanding candidates.
Cecconi singled out Yaccino as
the player with perhaps the best

5 chance of playing with the varsity

next year, “if he is willing to
work for. it.” .. V‘
“It’s hard to say what boy
will play varsity. next year,”
declared Cecconi. “The boy you
think might play may have
reached a’ peak;,on the other
hand a bo_y may be a sleeper in
his freshman year and come to
the front as a sophomore.

“One thing is for sure, any boy
I have mentioned could play some
varsity football next year, if he
wants it.” -
