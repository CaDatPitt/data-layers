Solons.A Heated Arguments
Heard on_Both Sides.

The student senate of the. Univer-
sity of Pittsbuigh encountered an-
\other stumbling block in the consti-
tition when a disagreement arose as’
to ‘the duties of the executive com-
mittee; that is, whether the executive

votes without the consent _Of the gen-
*eral senate. The senate upheld the
ruling of the Executive Committee by
a 2-3 majority. _ ,
After the re-portof the Executive.
Committee regarding the election held
last Wednesday, the brawl started.

It was a meeting ‘worthy of mention '

cation. It was an expected debate pre-

pared by senators who agreed with

the action taken by the «executive
committee, and those entirely opposed.

A motion to rescind the action of

the Executive Committee in, throw-

ing out the votes of the dental school
were the grounds for argumentson
both sides. The Executive. Committee
claiming that the balloting was un-

constitutional according to Article 8,

Sec. 3, Clause B which‘ states,
“The Executive Committee shall

provide a polling place for each school
of the University.  These polling
places shall open not later than nine
thirty o'clock and close not earlier
than 4:30 o'clock in the afternoon on
the day on which such election is
held.”

“The -ballots for the Dental School
were sent up by the mail boy at 9
o'clock,” said the chairman of the
Executive Committee. “They had the
ballots in the school, yet they allowed
the students but ﬁve minutes to vote.
This was altogether unconstitutional
according to Article 8, Sec. 3, which
speciﬁcally states that the polls shall
be open from; 9:30 o’clock until 4:30.
After a consultation by the three
members of the Executive Committee
we decided that the‘ ballots cast were
done so unconstitutiona1ly.”

It was then that the following pe-
tition was asked to be read by one
of the student senators.

To the Honorable, the Student Senate
of the University of Pittsburgh,
Greeting:

On O-ctober 18, 1915, at ‘a regular
meeting of your honorable body, it
was resolved that the students of the
Senior Class of the School of Dent-
istry be granted the privilege of vot-
ing in the election for Senior Class
officers.

on Wednesday, October 26, the elec-
tion was duly held and the instruc-
tions and provisions of the Executive
Committee, as at that time consti-
tuted, duly complied with and in ac-
cordance with all precedents estab-
lished in such cases by the School of
Dentistry.

As evidence of the complete ad-
herence to the rules laid down. in the
constitution for such cases, no formal
written protest was presented by.
any of the members of the Senior
Class of the School of Dentistry,
showing any irregularities or claim-
ing any violations of any of the elec-
tion provisions.

Three members of the Executive
Committee refused to recognize the
validity of the election conducted by
the Student Senate of the School of
‘Dentistry, and accordingly failed to

»" oust candidates in that election, with

Q In‘,tI;I5if;;;j;;Ion, the Eexecutive Com-
 its authority and

acted "without. cause, "no formal written I

protest ~ having _‘f1-__been received. The
Executive -'-“C ‘ ttee*ha.s"‘ no power
either to act .u>‘pon.protests or even
receive them, much less to throw out
a. regularly conducted election, as
provided in the Constitution.

Article IV, Section 1, of the Con-
stitution, reads:

“The duties of the Executive Com-
mittee shall be to conduct the elec-
tion, of head cheerleader, and as-
sist-ant cheerleaders, class officers,
including the representatives on the
board of the Junior year book and
of senators in the respective schools
through the medium of the several
School Senates.”

And Article VI, Section 5, reads:

“All powers or privileges not
speciﬁcally granted to the Executive
‘Committee or to the School Senates
or to the Student body at large shall
be vested in the General Senate.”
Therefore, recognizing that the

School of Dentistry had a perfect
right to vote on the election ‘of their
class oiﬁcers as provided by the Gen-
eral Senate; that the provisions in
said election were duly complied with
according to the constitution; that the
Executive Committee exceeded its
power in throwing. out the election
after it was ordered by the General
Senate and that the votes in said elec-
tion should be applied to the several
candidates" receiving them. .

The Honorable,.the General Senate
of the University of Pittsburgh,
respectfully petitioned to rescind the
acton of the Executve Committee and
to order the proper application of the
votes received by the several candl-
dates in the election in the School of
Dentistry, as above mentioned, ac-
cording to the provisions of s_aid Con-
stitution, which reads in Article III,
Section 2: .

“T-‘he Eexecutive. Committee shall

. be directly responsible to the Gen-
eral Senate, which. shall have power
to instruct’ the Executive Commit-
tee, and to rescind any action taken
by the Committee in the absence of
such instruction.” ’

Respectfully submitted,
Frederick A. Moran.

After a heated discussion the ac-
tion of the Executive Committee was
upheld by a two-thirds majority of the
senators present. .

During the hours of 9:30 to 4:30 the
time set by the con.stituti :1 many can-
didates, their supporters and lieuten-
ants could be seen standng around the
polls getting their supporters in line
tovote. It was the oﬂice of president
in the various classes that was hotly
contested. The O-fﬁce for ‘Junior presi--
dent was one of the big surprises of
the election. A

Jack Thompson, Eco. ’17; a member
of the Hi-Kockey Club, defeated his
opponent by the overwhelming major-
ity of 106-18, receiving every vote in
the schools of Economics, Mines and
Engineering. Honors for, the election-
of the Sophomore and Senior classes
were hotly contested; Miller winning
out in the Senior class and Hill in the
-Sophomore. It was the office for the‘
Senior presidency which caused the
special meeting of the senate Monday
morning. This issue was taken up by
the general senate, details of which
appear in another column of the Pitt
Weekly.

IIIIEAMEIIS ENIIIY
TRUE’ PLEASUIIES

Dr. Lindsay Tells Assembly That
Man Dies With Expiration of
His Imagination.

“The gift of the imagination is the
most useful gift in life. It is the
pleasure of a man’s life, Man dies
with the death of his imagination,”
said Dr. Lindsay at the weekly as-
sembly last Friday morning.

“Great men are the men who are ea-
pable of dreaming great things and
can make'their dreams come true.”
The Pilgrims who came to America
dreamed of a life on the shores of this
side of the Atlantic. By perseverance
they realized their dreams, just as
all social reforms have grown out of
dreams. The French Revolution is
the product of an imagination. Pat-
rick Henry imagined a better system
of government for America.

“Thou shalt adjust thyself to chang-
ing environment and life” i.s the first
law which Dr. Lindsay set forth toward
the realization of one’s imagination.
“Thou shalt ideaiize thy friends. Ideal-
izing those with whom we come into
contact will aid us to the end of real-
izing our imaginations.”

The third law is “Thou shalt for-
give thy enemies.” A real man is one
who has the power to consider himself
in the place of his enemy and for-
give him. If we expect nations til
forgive one another, individuals surely
must forgive one another.

“Thou shalt give thyself over to
the realization, of thy ambitions and
life." This is the fourth law, which
Dr. Lindsay suggests leads toward
the realization of one’s imaginations’?
We must cause our dreams to come
true. In order to do this we must
work and think. Don’t think in a

the signiﬁcance of the foundation of

again on selecting so distinguished a

Attractive Art Work Done by
A. B. Johnston, ’17, R. O. Dar-

The football issue of the Panther,
Pitt’s humorous Inagazine, appeared
on the campus Thursday . morning
brim full of humor and jest. A mad
rush for copies correspondingly fol-
lowed.

A comparison of the publication of
this year with that of last year shows
a marked improvement in favor of the
c1IrI'cnt issue, especially in the art
department. The work of A. B.
Johnston, ’17, R. O. Darragh, '18, and
V. A. Jevon. ’19, is of ﬁrst class order
and compares favorably with the art
work of other similar publications.

Following a few advertisements, at

The editorial page is devoted to
greetings to students and freshmen,
also some “up-to-the-minute-dope” on
matters pertaining to the University
in general. The following pages are
given over to a lighter vein of thought.

About 1,500 copies of the initial issue
were printed, aI1d IM-anager Lovitz!
stated that the sale had exceeded his‘

It is the intention of the board to
have the Panther appear once a month

advent of a new
epoch in the life of our institution,
,and to far-seeing men, the inception of

the only basic idea which lies at the

Relating incidentally to the Nearing
Case, which we treated editorially two
weeks ago, the board of trustees of
"the University of Pennsylvania
unanimously adopted at its October
meeting the following resolutions,
which we reprint in order to stress
our present thesis, as well as to define
mo.re clearly the board‘s attitude in the
recent unpleasantness:

nizes the well-nigh impossible taslr~ofi

Board of Trustees made strong recom-

ment of a dean whose sole responsi-
bility should be to the graduate school,
and the endowment of chairs such as
the Willard Gibbs professorship for
purely graduate work. .

Such is the challenge and the pros-
pect which the University of Pitts-
burgh faces. I We wrong ourselves in
thinking that this is a purely and ad-
ministrative or academic problem. It
is one which vitally concerns every
student and alumnus member of the
University organization, and most cer-
tainly every faculty member down to
the newest instructor. The placing of
our Graduate School on a level with
those of the other great universities
of the country, means the endowment
of not one such chair as the Willard

We may have athletics, as we are rap-
idly coming to have, of such a quality
as to habitually defeat Harvard or
Illinois on the gridiron. We may
elaborate our student activities to their
highest efficiency. We may cover our
acropolis with a physical equipment,
the peer of Cornell's or Stanford’s, but
until we have such a graduate school
as ourbiggest and broadest men fore-
see, our University cannot reach its
highest consummation.

To Editor of Pitt Weekly. ,

One of the ;many pleasing features
witnessed at Franklin Field Saturday
was the cheering, and all around spirit
shown by the-Pitt rooters. Lead by
Adam.Wood, one of the assistant
cheerleaders, the Pitt rooters made‘
quite an impression on the Penn
people, and Pitt's aggressive leader
was the subject of much comme_nt in.
Philadelphia papers‘.

A regrettable thing in this connec-
tion, however, is the fact that our Ath-
letic Authorities made no provision for
carrying our cheerleader to Philad-elk
phia. But for the eleventh hour ap-
pearance of Wood, we would have been
without a leader. The latter deserves
a great deal of credit, in as much as
he not only paid his own fare to
Philadelphia, but was compelled to
pay the regular $1.50 admission. Our
authorities not even securing him— a
ﬁeld privilege. _

Our school is big enough to carry
.a cheerleader to’ a, game like Penn,

they will be taken along. -

of a country has never been more
searchingly tested, since the days of
Emelrson’s ‘The American Scholar”
and Curtis’ “The Scholar in the Re-
public}? In our colleges, the coming
generation must be brought to think
sanely, effectively, with restraint, and
with no unswept corners, if the United
States is to weather these decades of
crisis, triumphant, and ﬁnd .. favor in
the sight of God and men.

WHAT D’YE MEAN--FRESH MEN 7

Once there was a Freshman. There
may have been other Frleslhmen, but
we are writing, “Dear Reader,” about
this particular Freshman. How such
a. daring creature came to “wander in
our midst is naught to us. The fact
nemains that he wandered and for-
tunately for him we cannot add
“Lonely as a cloud.” The Freshman
walked by the side of a Fair Co-ed!

It makes no difference, “Gentle
Reader,” who the Co-ed was. Do not
ask unnecessary questions.

Now it came to pass that a Sopho-
more came down that way and seeing
the Freshman he fell upon him and
beat him. Round the scene of cruelty
rushed other Freshmen to rescue their
fellow in adversity. Then 01! came
the Sophs in a mighty throng and the
upper classmen on their way from As-
sembly.

Assembly is held every Friday morn-
ing in Memorial Hall. For reserved

Then came the tug of war. X indi-

with all the breaks of the: game going
against them the Blue and Gold grid-
iron warriors at times showed ﬂashes-

S of form that have made them the most"

formidable aggregation in college cir-
cles today, and downed the rejuvinat-

on Franklin'Field before a. crowd of
between eighteen and twenty thous-
and enthusiastic spectators. «Theyﬁnal
score of 14 to 7 in no way shows the
true strength of ‘the two teams. In
the iirstfhabg’ alone, the Pitt backﬁeld
advanced the ball over 200 yards far-
ther than their eastern opponents did
on scrimmage plays. .Time after time
the whirlwind attack of Fry, DeHart,
Hastings_and Williamson would sweep

thru. the Penn ﬁrst, line and carry the
ball within easy striking -distance of
the goal, but always, at oh; crucial
moment, loose‘ handling of the ball
would forfeit their opportunity to
score and the ball would go to their
opponents. , i

The team that took the ﬁeld for the
Philadelphia was a different team
than the one that lost to Penn State
and tied with the Middies. Entering
the game with all regular men in the
‘lineup for the ﬁrst.time this year, the
Penn eleven played their hardest. and
the form displayed was the ‘be.  ‘ V
they have shown for the pa‘ .2
years. But their efforts were unavail-
ing. The squad that swamped .-the
Navy and the Carlisle Indians, could
not be denied ultimate victory and the

to hold them to as small a score as
possible. . ' i r
The game was ﬁlled with thrilling
plays that constantly kept the huge‘
-crowd in spspense, and although” never
seriously threatened the Pitt boys had
to play with all their ability to hold
the_- ﬁghting eas-terners in check. The
play of Warner’s pvrotseges was marked
by a lack of thzTt’ ‘coherence of team
work. thali, marked their previous
games this .year, but to make up for
the lack» of team play the individual
prowess of Jimmy DeHart on the of-
fense and "Pat” Herr-on on the de-
fense, was enough to spell defeat for
Dic,kson’s.men. 

VDeHart Plays We-ll

DeHart’s'exhibition of end running
was the best open ﬁeld work that has

. been seen on Franklinvlfield for sev-

eral‘"seas-ons. . His wonderful speed,
coupled with an almost unnatural.
ability to keep his feet, paved the-way
directly for his team's second touch-
down", and several times in the ﬁrst
half it was due to his carrying the ball
that the play was kept in the enemy’s
territory. At the beginning of the last
quarter with the ball on Pitt's 40 yard
line, DeHart took the pigskin, ﬁrst
around one end andthen around the
other, the entire distanced over the
goal line. ' With" the ball "on the 10
yard line Meadows called for Jimmy
around left end. Eluding a t-ackler he
fumbled the ball, and for a moment it
looked as though another chance to
score would be thrown away. But
catching the ball on the rebound, the
diminutive -half, with a ﬁnal «burst of
speed, dashed over the calcium and
planted the ball between the goal
posts. This ﬁnally proved to be the
winning touchdown. . - -

Herron Stars A
The work of,“Pat” I-Ierron on the

' defense and the offense was no less

ybrilliant.» T'he.Monessen boy was on
_the job from‘ the ﬁrst blow of the

lwhistle and it was directly to two-

great plays of his that the ﬁnal result

end. a In the second period, without
either» side having registered, it was
directly due to lHerron’s recovery of
Ross’s fumble that gave Pitt. its.op-
portunity to‘ score their first points-
‘Ii’ was in the third quarter that he
made a long diving tackle and caught
the speedy Berry from behind when
the Philly star had a clear ﬁeld for a
touchdown. Berry, playing back, re-
covered (Williamson's onside kick on
the run and with an interference‘ of
ﬁve men started down the field for
the Pitt line 75 yards away. Hocken-
smith, Thornhill, Soppitt and Hastings
were all pushed aside and it seemed
that it would be impossible to catch
him. But. dashing across the ﬁeld and
hurling himself through; they air Her-
ron executed a perfect tackle and the

behind when he had :a clear ﬁeld in

front for a touchdown.  -
Penn’s touchdown was indirectly due
to Morrow’s fumble *and directly, to
outguessing the Pittsburgh defense on
the ﬁnal chance of seven to put the
ball over the line. Morrow playing for
Hastings, who was hurt, fumbled on
Pitt’s 23 yard line. Bucks thru tackle
put the pigskin  our yards from
the goal. Three times the Pennsyl-
vania backs hurled themselves at the
line but still they lacked two yards
from the coveted mark. At this point
a Pitt man was offside and the ball
was advanced to the one yard line
and put in play as ﬁrst down. Three
more stabs at the line lost them“ a
yard instead of gaining. ‘With one
more down to make the giant Greek
Dorizas was rushed, into the fray. On
the next play while Sutherland had
sent the huge guard sprawling, W11-
liams ran around Pitt's left end and
across theline with no one opposing
him. - The play completely outguessed
the opposing defense who were ex-
pecting aplunge thru the line. This

former owing to his experience in that’

capacity.

of the team and it was during his call-

good. game in carrying back "punts.
Morrow, who went in for ‘Hastings put
up a sterling brand of ball. His one
mistake occurred when he had this

him out of thegame for a.:weeik or so.

Freshmen‘ Victorious  

Coach Kerr’s tribe of football war-
riors annexed their initial victory of
theseason last Friday by taking over
the Pittsburgh Academy eleven in a
listless game that ended 20 to 9. The
tussle was staged on Trees Stadium
before a good crowd} ~

Minus thelservices of Captain ‘Lo-
baugh and several star p1a.yea°s, who
were slightly incapacitated for duty,
the Freshmen I started . the game
against their lighter“ adversaries and
experienced considerable difficulty in
working together smoothly as they
did in the Bellefonte and Kiski con-
iiicts. by Occasionally ﬂashes of true
form enabled them to registerthe ﬁnal
count. L » _

The Academy boys, greatly out-
Weighedifiput up a plucky ﬁght. They
fought hard and clean, but frequent

; fumbling spoiled their attack. Gal-

lagher for the losers made the feature

_, play ofthe game. late in the last quar-
‘ ter when he intercepted a forward

pass and advanced 50 yards before
Heil brought {him to the turf. ,

_“Gunboat” Smith, the .Freshmen’s‘
wizard at line plunging, had to retire
from the fray owing to an injury
which dazed him so that it was im-
possible for him to follow signals.
During his stay. in the fracas he ex-
hibited some daring feats on offensive-

. pslay.

Heil was responsible for some con-
fusion on his signals, but displayed
great form in starting the ball on for-
ward passes. The men on the receiv-
ing end of these heaves failed dis-
mally with the exception of Hammer
who gathered in several for good
gains. ~  ‘

McIntyre was the best man on de-
fense for the Freshmen. He smeared
almost everything that was tried
through him. Keenan and «Ittel did
well for the Academy eleven.

s oke on “The Especial Value of Re-

in Pure Chemistry.” After

Vpidly reviewing some of the ‘more

has made to civilization,‘ he point-

e _out that it .Was research in pure

ng foundations upon which applied ‘
ence has erected ‘all the wonder-.

ll surely be the Age of Chemistry.

- Bogert referred to the .great
rvice which. the University of

tsburgh and its Mellon Institute are

;n W rendering the public, and con-
atulated them upon the establishing
fgthe newichalr of Research
urei Chemistry as one ofthe most
e eVctlv.e ways of furthering research
"and Voa momentousi step in the direc-
on!‘ of building up a‘ splendid new
graduate school. He believed that a
_iversity’s “true greatness was not
easured by the magnificence of its
ant, the: size or. athletic prowess

1-‘ f ’ its student body, but by the ex-
eilence of its graduate school, and
at, the standard of the latter was
etermined by the amount and quality
jot its ‘production of genuinely original
work, and the character of its fac-
ulty.” ‘I-Iesaid, further, “‘that the
extent of the assistance which anni-
I rarity secures from its surrounding

‘co’ munity in the creation of such ,
‘ graduate school as that of the‘.

n1versit_y of Pittsburgh was often a
road indication ofthe attitude of the

iversity ‘authorities themselves
oward such work.” In this respect
c said that the University of Pitts.-
urgh was, indeed, fortunate in

 jancellor and Director Bacon upon
securing as the first occupant of the
Chair so distinguished a scientist as

long {after the beautiful buildings of

I 2-As already stated elsewhere, the

‘Dr. ‘Rosanoff said in part, -“.Iosiah

The unusual demand for chemists,

Chemistry to meet this demand and

‘paring himself for this profession,
were the subjects of an interview giv-

“One of the alleviating circum-

Silverman, “is the fact that it forces
the attention of all on the place which

It has induced a growing appreciation

;that the 10,000 chemists of the United

such as were desired were unavailable
for these positions. 5
