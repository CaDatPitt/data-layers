Seniors to Take Photos
For Inclusion in 1940

Yearbook by Saturday
This Saturday,

November 25, is

“the last day for seniors to have their

photographs taken for the. 1940 Owl,
according to Richard -R.'Weiss, C40,
editor of the senior yearbook.

Photographs are being taken at the '

Photo-Reﬂex studios on the: fourth
ﬂoor at Gimbel’s. The p1.10t0S are
informal this year, in contrast to the
‘tuxedos and drapes used in previous
editions of the book.

Seniors should have their pictures
included in the Owl, as it is the only
permanent record of their life at the
University, Weiss says. Activities
of their four years in college are in-
cluded; in the book which makes a
lasting memento of college days. V"  »

“At this time 1 would like to thank
the orga-nizations on campus Who
have had their pictures taken for in-
clusion in the activities. and frater-
nities section of the Owl,” Weiss
states.

“These pictures have turned out
beautifully this year. Informal shots
against different backgrounds Were
used throughout, and the results haVe
surpassed expectations of anyone On
the staﬁ.”

Weiss stated that informal ph0t0-
graphs of campus life. at the Univer-
sity are now being taken by CW1
photographers. These photographs
will show a large number of people
who have not been included in any
previous issue of the Owl.

“There is a more complete and in-
dividual coverage of the students in
the book this year,” he said. “The
pictures will be more representative
of the general student body than ever
before.”

Colleges Favor
Culture Studies

By Student Opinion Surveys of
America.

AUSTIN, Tex., Nov. 21.—-If Amer-
ican students could plan the course
of study for the nation’s colleges and
universities, an overwhelming ma-
jority would’ prescribe wide cultural
background, the Student Opinion
Surveys of America ﬁnd in their lat-
est national poll of campus thought.

Only 17 per cent of the country’s
collegians believe that higher educa-
tion should be mainly technical and
professional training. The rest say
they prefer a curriculum that will
embrace a general education rather
than one that will produce men and
women primarily skilled in the trades
and the professions. But 37 per cent

of this last group make it clear that

their choice is the school that pre-
sents a blendin.g of the two extremes.

Since the weekly polls of the Sur-
veys are all based on a coast—to-coast
sampling determined from actual en-
rollments, these results represent the
opinions of the million and a half
students in all kinds of colleges, both
technical and otherwise- The Sur-
veys are conducted in cooperation

with The News and nearly 150 other .

campus publications. Headquarters
are at the University of Texas, Aus-
tin. _, '7

A surprisingly large number would
agree to only cultural studies but
there is also a large group that be-
lieves college is the place to train
both “knowers” and “doers.”
result of the poll are:

College Education Should-'-—
Be mainly technical and profes-

sional . . . . . . . . . . . . ..17 per cent
Emphasize a wide cultural back-
ground . . . . . . . . . . . . . .46 per cent
Include both . . . . . ..37 per cent

Sentiment for professional train-
ing is least popular with New Eng-
land students (7), and most in favor
with Far Westerners (24 per cent).
All other sections of the country agree
almost exactly with national student
opinion as shown above.

Faculty Attend Meetings

Dr. 0. E. Jennings, head of the
biology department, will attend the
meeting of the American Association
for the Advancement of Science,
which will be held at Columbus, Ohio.

Dr. Edna Higbee, secretary of the

Philip Walker, graduate student as-
sistant in ‘biology, will attend the

Pm Panthers Add Ohio State
To Football; Schedule  1940

Pitt's 1940 football schedule will
include eight games, six of them at
home, director of athletic publicity
Frank Carver announced yesterday.

Biggest surprise of the eight is the
opener. A last-minute telegram
brought about the scheduling of Ohio
State for September 28 at Columbus.
The Buckeyes, the only Big Ten team
on the list, replaces West Virginia,
a traditional opponent.

In addition to West Virginia, the
Panthers have not re-scheduled Du-
quesne, Washington, and Temple, all
of whom appeared on the 1939 sched-
ule. V

The six home games will be
stretched out over a period of eight
weeks with open dates slated before

Phi G-ams Halt
Chem Seniors

In Grid Playoff

By John Chaffo

By mixing a well-balanced run-
ning attack with the bullet passes of
halfback Chris Watson, the Phi Gams
defeated the Chem Seniors 26-13
Monday afternoon and gained the
ﬁnals of the intramural football play-
offs.

The Phi Gam team opened their
scoring on a long pass from Watson
to Mansﬁeld after only two plays
had elapsed. Watson’s kick for the
point after touchdown split the up-
rights and put the Phi Gams ahead
by a 7-0 score.

A few moments later Watson again
played pitcher, but this time it was
Roberts on the receiving end instead
of Mansﬁeld. The touchdown cli-
maxed a drive that started on the
Fiji one-yard line, where the Chems
had lost the ball on downs.

Still in a ﬁghting mood, the Chems
pulled the cover off their prize play
of the afternoon, a lateral with a
long pass tacked on the end. The
play brought a score but the ofﬁcials
nulliﬁed the tally, claiming the lat-
eral was a forward pass.

«Several plays later, the Chems
broke into the scoring column when
Bectol hauled down Lynch’s pass in
the end zone. Lynch then passed to
Barrier for the extra point.

Watson again ﬁgured heavily in
the scoring for the Phi Gams as he
passed and ran the Chems ragged.
The same play that brought the ﬁrst
Phi Gam score clicked again as
Mansﬁeld took Watson’s pass and put

I the Chems farther behind. Two long

touchdown runs by. the passing Wat-
son ended the scoring for the victors.

The second Chem touchdown came
when McKee caught a pass thrown
by Barrier, who evaded the Phi
Gam secondary, and ran unmolested
for a score.

The‘victory over the Chem Seniors
gives the Phi Gams a chance to meet
the Punks, Independent league
champs, and also a chance to avenge
the defeat the Punks gave them last
Friday.

Public Phone Booths

Two public telephone booths have
been installed for student use in the
office of William Daufenbach, assist-
ant to the dean of men. The oiﬁce is
directly across from the University
bookstore on the ﬁrst floor.

the Nebraska and Tech games. Final
match of the year will send the Pan-
thers to Durham, North Carolina, to

Missouri’s Tigers with “Passin’
Pau1” Christman will be in Pitts-I
burgh October 5 for the home open-
er, followed by the Southern Meth-
odist Mustangs on October 12 and_ the
Fordham Rams on October 19.

Afterla week’s layoff Charley Bow-
ser’s boys take on Nebraska No-
vember 2, rest another week, and

meet the Carnegie Tech Tartans No-
vember 16. The annual Penn State
game is scheduled a week later, No-
vember 23, and the trip to Duke
winds up the season.

Turkey!
University Uses
This W'eek’s Date

By Mary Lou Caldwell

There was no meeting of execu-
tives; no weighty get-together of ad-
ministrative officers; nary a peep
from the alumni--and so Thanksgiv-
ing vacation will begin on Thursday,
November 23.

Thursday was announced by the
University’s ofﬁcers as being the
official school holiday. And how was
that decision reached? The Univer-
sity merely fell in with the Govern-
or’s proclamation which had fallen
in with the President’s proclamation.

Yet, this isn’t the ﬁrst time they’ve

~ shifted Thanksgiving, according to

the Campus Collegian, student pub-
lication of the University of Toledo.
Says the Collegian, ‘-‘Although Amer-
icans consider it a national annual
observance of the Pilgrims, it was

not established as such until 1864+»

when Lincoln asked the people to
give thanks to God for the blessings
they enjoyed even though they were
in the midst of a Civil War.

“Since then, Lincoln’s successors
have similarly issued proclamations
specifying the last Thursday in No-
vember as a day of Thanksgiving.”

The custom of celebrating Thanks-
giving iwas intermittent up until
President Lincoln’s proclamation.
George Washington, in 1789 and in
1795 initiated the custom of Thanks-
giving day, and it was followed by
other presidents.

Pre-Meds Take
Aptitude Tests

All pre-medical students at the
University will take examinations on
Tuesday, November 28, at 2:30
o’clock in 132 Cathedral to determine
their eligibility for medical school,
-announces Dr. Omar C. Held, per-
sonnel assistant to the dean of the
College.

These medical aptitude tests given
by the committee of the Association
of American Medical Colleges, are
used by the admission ofﬁcers in the
various medical schools as a factor
in the selection of students.

A fee of $1 to defray the costs of
printing, giving, and scoring the tests,
must be paid at the treasurer’s ofﬁce,
State Hall, before the test is taken.
The receipt will serve as admission
for the test.

sponsored by the SFA Safety Com-
mittee will be broadcast by radio sta-
tion KQV, at 8:15 o’clock.

The safety program, entitled “Pull

safety quiz with an oﬁicial of the
state mtor police ﬁring questions on
traffic safety and regulations at two
teams of University students.

On one team will be three mem-
bers of Delta Delta Delta, women’s
social fraternity, who are determined
to prove that “men are not better
drivers than women” to a picked
team of three members of Delta Tau
Delta, .rnen’s social fraternityt.

cast has been prepared by Frank
Miller, C41, member of the Safety
Committee. Other committee mem-
bers include Dave Buente, C41, chair
man, and Dan Cannon, C41.

Monday night’s broadcast will be
followed by a week of safety pro-
grams, including many practical dem-
onstrations of safety precautions and
hints on “how to grow old inspite of
high traﬁic fatality rolls.” The cam-
paign will extend from December 4
to 9. *

Umble Describes Recording Process
In Curriculum of Speech Department

It is now possible for speech stu-
dents to talk"bac_k to themselves-on
a recording. Starting this year the
recording of the spoken word will be
a part of the regular speech curricu-
lum.

Roy E. Umble, instructor in Eng-
lish and speech stated, “Our objects
are to let the student hear himself
objectively, and to motivate the
study of the voice and aid instruc-
tion for the instructor.” Mr. Umble
explained that no one sounds as he
thinks he sounds. Those who have
had recordings made of their voices
are usually surprised when they
hear the results. “Migawd,” they
say, “is that me?”—similar to the ex-
pression given when snapshots are
developed.

Buy Records

Before the recordings are made,
each student purchases his recording
disks at the bookstore and makes an
appointment for his recording. Be-
fore it is made, under the supervision
of Harold Lewis, ME40, the student
is given a mimeographed sheet con-
taining the directions for making a
recording. The student’s name, ad-
dress, and place of birth are spoken
into the microphone which is con-
n.ected to the machine. A

Then follows a short reading in
which most common sounds that are
usually garbled are contained. Next
an extemporaneous speech is given,
the entire operation taking about
three minutes. This usually. covers
one side of the disc.

Two Recordings

The records are then played by
the instructors who judge them ac-
cording to voice quality, melody, time

WSGA Group Conducts
‘Penny’ Fund Campaign

“Have you given a penny for every
birthday to the campaign or are you

funds for purchasing a silver service
set to be given the University on Wo-

Through the making of these re-"

of improvement for most students.

After stalking down dark side
streets between the Cathedral and
the print shop, growling in last week-
end’s advance publicity, and act-
ually roaring when Lew ”Leave ’em
stranded” Riley’s circulation staff
went to work, the November issue of
the Pitt Panther Wheezed on cam-
pus Monday.

Because a written order from my
editor demanded a review of the
twenty-eight pages of type, cartoons,
and white space, this reporter bor-
rowed Freda Jaffe’s paid-for-copy
and looked at every page.

And I liked it.

For though I agreed with business
manager Hoeveler that the Panther
isn’t supposed to be funny, I discov-
ered that the magazine had good art
work, contained several well-written
articles, and had an intriguing cross-
word puzzle.

George Gregg dished out a cover
that was smart looking (as well as
good Democraticipublicity). Frank
and Joe Kristufek turned out the best
page of the issue with their descrip-
tions of a turkey and some admin-
istration activity directors.

The Panther’s most publicized ar-
ticle, however, was a ﬂop. What was
built up as the greatest hoax to hit
the campus was the Frank Miller-
created, Bob Gestrich-executed
“Smart Sammy” episode. What act-
ually appeared in the Panther was 22
inches of exaggerated, but very dull
stuﬁ, which succeeded in making an
ass out of the author.
this term “amateur psychologist.”

Honors for this section of the is-
sue go to artist Kristufek’s work,
marred only by Marjorie John’s “To
Err Is Human,” which I haven’t ﬁg-
ured out yet (but I do ﬁnd in it a
resemblance of test stories which
eliminated prospective Pitt News re-
porters early this fall).

The baby portrait section, edited
by Jack “let me write a letter” Stauif,
was informative if not new. It took
me back to the Carnegie high school
year book_of 1889 which carried the
same “clever” idea.

Some of the Panther short short
stories are commendable. Helen
Buente deserves her by—line in larg-
er type, Stauff’s “On Shopping With

DAIRY BAR

Craig Near Forbes

By Freda Jaffe

The suave gentlemen on the busi-
ness staff of the News are glib of
tongue when they set out to land a
three column advertisement or swag-
ger up to the outstanding senior Of
last year to solicit a one year’s sub-
scription to the News.

But last Monday these loquacious
gentlemen were stumped when
George Simenoff, BA38, sought them
out and asked the price of a life sub-
scription. With doubtful modesty
the business board had, it seems, nev-
er even considered the possibility
that someone, someday, somewhere
might want a life’s subscvription. Un-
able to quote a price, they were
forced to forestall the anxious alum-
nus.

Simenoff, in the few minutes that
he lingered in the outer office, he-
came a liked ﬁgure. But we were

Payment for Life Subscription

just a bit curious about that life sub-
scription. Later the University grad-
uate claimed that he realizes now
more fully than he did while he was
in school, how much college meant to
him. “I feel lost withthout the
News,” he said.

Our obliging first life subscriber
told us that this little item would not
be his ﬁrst appearance in the News.
He was in ’36, ’37, ’38 a member of
the wrestling team, he told us.

Simenofl’ is one of three Bulgarian

students to graduate from the Uni-
versity. He has, he explained been
in America for 15 years. The former
University student feels that his edu-
cation at the college has been largely
responsible for the job he now holds.

When the business staif did man-
age to pool their wits they quoted Mr.
Simenoﬂz’ the price of $25. And he
said, simply, “I’1l take it.”

The YM and YW, in their non-

ant executive secretary of the YMCA.
Several of the joint activities in-
clude Inquiry Forum, the monthly

Much of the work of the YMCA is

their school clubs. The YM also
sponsor several projects for student
betterment, often in conjunction with
the YWCA.

Discussion groups are arranged by
both the YM and YWCA, often be-
ing open to both men and women. In
these meetings social problems, reli-
gious problems, and even student
problems are discussed in order to
give students a chance to express
themselves in a solution of these

Aniong‘ Our Prayers
At This Thanksgiving

, At this Thanksgiving, we, as students, have
ma_ny things to be thankful for. Most of all we are
thankful that We are at peace. In our prayers of
thanksgiving, we can show gratitude for our educa-
,tional. opportunities, for our freedom, for all the
-things that are part of the life of one who goes to
school in America. And we can earnestly pray
that we may continue in these things, that war
shall not rob us of our youth or of our lives.

But, in this time of thanksgiving, we remember
one prayer that is neither good nor beautiful. Yet,
we think that it is worth repeating because its
author said, “I have told the whole truth in it, and
‘only ‘dead men can tell the whole truth in this
]woi~ld.” _ , -

 is the “VVar Prayer” written by Mark Twain,
‘and, at his request, not published until after his
'__death,_ so that he might tell the “whole truth.” We
repeat it-«here: 1

“O Lord our God, help us “to tear their soldiers
to bloody shreds with our shells; help us to cover
their smiling ﬁelds with the pale forms of their
patriot dead ;, help us to drown the thunder of the
guns with the cries of the wounded, writhing in
pain; help us to lay waste their humble homes with
_hur_ricane of ﬁre; help us to wring the hearts of
their unoffending widows with -unavailing grief;
help us to turn them out roofless, with their little
children ‘to»_'wan_,der unfriended through wastes of
their desolated lands in rags and hunger and thirst,
sport of the sun "ﬂames of summer and the icy winds

of winter, broken in spirit, worn with travail, im-
"Thee forthe refuge of the grave and:de-
nied it‘-9-for our sakes, who adore Thee, Lord, blast
their hopes, blight their lives, protract their bitter
‘pilgrimage, make heavy their steps, water their
' way with their tears, stain the white snow with

blood of their wounded feet! We ask of One who
3 is the spirit of. love and who is the everfaithful
 refuge and friend of all that are sore beset and
E seek , His aid with humble and contrite hearts.
i Grant our prayer, 0 Lord, and Thine shall be the
' praise and honor and glory now and ever.’ Amen.”

‘Higher Education
‘In Bohemia-Moravia

Last week in peaceful Bohemia-Moravia, once
-‘ Czechoslovakia, which welcomed its German de-
' liverers last year with open arms and cheering
throngs, 12 students were executed and thousands
if more imprisoned for inciting riots. In addition, all
I ‘universities have been ordered closed for a period
; of at least three years.
 Up in Poland, recently released from bondage
7 by a National Socialist Moses, Universities have 11ot
even been permitted to open. It seems that the
Crermans, like their erstwhile Southern friends, are
, civilizing‘ their neighbors.
The curtailment: of institutions of higher learn-

I ing under Nazi rule would lead one to think that

the Germans are afraid that, should two or more
:.supposedly' intelligent and well—informed persons
3-‘. get together they would not agree with the exist-
?" ting government. In Bohemia-Moravia the spirit of
‘if; Thomas. G. Masaryk has not been blotted out.

As far, as we can remember, students have never-

!“ been an alarmingly peaceful lot‘. Viennese students

 in the days of the younger Strauss revolted against
 the Austrian government. Oxford students rioted
if, through the streets with the townsmen. And
_" American students go on strike, sometimes for rea-

j: sons more serious than football victories.

_ The students ‘of today are the leaders of tomor-
 row. They should reflect thearising opinions of
E their countries. If this is true, we hesitate to say
7 that the peoples of'Mi._ddle..Europe are all devout
 followers of one Herr Adolf Hitler.

 Alumni who give a similar dinner. Also, in the
 future a better time might be arranged for. But
lregardless, for this event theﬂstudent body ought to
.,'turn out in its best fashion with its best Pitt spirit.

. {Commons Boom Displays?

 Last week, Student-Faculty Association voted
in favor of a request to the University for the use
of part of the Commons Room for its safety cam-
paign. Plans of the campaign chairman, Dave
Buente, C41, called for erection of a display back-
ground and several reaction—testing machines.

Apparently the University has decided that a
display of this naturewill detract from the atmos-
phere of the Commons‘Room. \Ve don’t believe it
advisable for the safety committee to press this
case, but we do feel that SFA might well include
in its next meeting a discussion of just what activi-
ties are suitable for the Commons Room.

Cusick Sees Good Will
Between Pitt, Tech

Editor, the Pitt News:

I wish to take this opportunity to thank your pub-
lication and the student body of the University for their
.ﬁne spirit and unfailing support of a new idea in Tech-
Pitt relations during the past football week-end.

None of us can say thevthing was a complete suc-
cess, but then nothing is perfect the ﬁrst time, and there
is something elsewhich I wish to bring to your atten-
tion in this letter-—something which we doubted we
could get from thje students of both schools.

Some people call that of which I speak “good will’?
or “friendly relations.” Its outward manifestation was
demonstrated in hundreds of little things which hap-
pened on Saturday and Monday.

As one who is tired of slugging. incidents, painted

me congratulate both student bodies and their leaders

for a splendid performance. ‘

I hope that this last week-end was but the beginning

of a great tradition and an unprecedented era of good

feeling between the two schools. V ’

I A Sincerely yours, .

PATRICK J.-CUSICK, JR-., -President

were established, this is not so. I believe that the
friendshipibetween Tech and Pitt was cemented ﬁrmer
than ever before, as shown by the attitude of the Skibo
students who came down and mingled with the victors
as the cheers were being shouted.

Quoted by Pat. Cusick, “It was a good celebration
in every respect. The spirit of the Pitt students was
excellent, the spirit of the Tech students was excellent,
we had a good time and there were no ﬁghts.”

So, Mr. Hahn, if you read the Pitt News you should
have noticed that the prized “goal posts” were achieved
inan orderly manner, as the plans were intended.

Mr. Hahn, may I say this-—Our parade and invasion
at Tech was rowdy, but neither rough nor vicious as
was the Duquesne aﬁair. Our rally also managed to
keep from entering or disturbing any of the Carnegie
classes. Do you really think there were any hard feel-
ings created between the schools. Come on now, don’t
you admit that some fun, as well as work should pre-
vail in college, especially after an important victory as

Writer Tours
International

By Gertrude Lieblich

We have made our annual duty
tour of the Carnegie International,
and laugh!—never have we seen so
many artists standing in front of
their own pictures. The whole place
looks like a gangster’s underworld,
the way all the pictures have been
set up and framed. We’re only sor-
ry we didn’t see more artists hang-
ing.

After wandering through three
galleries, we stopped looking for pic-
tures and started looking for benches.
After all, you can get a better per-
spective of art when you’re sitting
down. And it’s much easier on the
feet.

A nice old lady pointed out a cer-
tain portrait to us and said, “That
picture has a restful effect on me---
such a nice, sweet girl.” Five min-
utes later a volatile young man re-
marked, “See that portrait of «a girl?
She’s a dangerous character —- a
home-breaker if there ever was one.”
He was pointing to the very same
picture. , _

There were the usual pictures re-
sulting from bad breakfasts, wet
feet,‘and bleary, or “beery”, eyes.

has i to tell everyone in the world
about it. .

Just as we were leaving, we saw
one realistic scene that caught our
attention. “Now, there’s a. good
picture!” we exclaimed. “We like
that—al1 the grass, and ‘the View in
the distance! It’s just the way
things actually look. 'There’s real-
ism foryou!” '

Gestrich Explains

‘Smart Sammy"
Editor, the Pitt News:

In regards to the book, “We, The
Civilized,” in case anyone is teetering
on the fence of doubt, R. J. Gestrich
undoubtedly did not write the said
opus. It was unfortunate that the
News was made an innocent accom-
plice to the hoax, but it was neces-
sary to obtain satisfactory results.

The story deﬁnitely was for but
one purpose, to record the psycholog-
ical reaction of the student body to
rise of an author, and his supp:-sed
opulence. Therefore, if the News, out
of the kindness of its heart, will
gather up the tattered remains
of my integrity (?), dust them off
tenderly, and return them to me, via
the Panther ofﬁce, I will remain,

Gratefully yours,
BOB “Smart Sammy” GESTRICH.

The News really isn’t mad at the
Panther or at Mr. Gestrich for their
clever’ publicity build-up of the
“Smart Sammy” episode. We did
object to the use of the News to
spread false information on a story
which was reported in good faith to
the University by the News.

As for Mr. _Gestrich’s integrity,
never let it be said that the News
attacked a University student unjust-
ly. As far as we’re concerned, we
like the Panther, and Mr. Gestrich.

Four Pitt Seniors Who Start

FRANK KRISTUFEK

DICK CASSIANO

FROM THE

SIDELINES

By BILL MCELWAIN
Sports Editor

SFA’S FOOTBALL BANQUET will piit a lot of people squarely
on the well-known spot. We’ve heard it said (and we believe it’s
true) that this year has marked a change  student attitude toward
the football team. The students are ﬁnally backing the boys be-
cause they ’re the Pitt team, not because of their national prominence.

So far the backing h.as been in the form of attendance at the
games (a student book admits you free) or verbal encouragement
(good lungs are the only qualiﬁcation). The banquet will require
just a little more than that, one dollar per banqueter to be exact.
Only students and faculty members will be asked to attend, so that
the success or failure of the venture will depend entirely on those
groups.

Talk is all right. At times, it ’s a ﬁne thing. But’ we have long
believed that the test of a man’s sincerity is hi.s willingness to dig
into the lining and materially support a cause or group whose merits
he has been declaiming.

Beacon Ready for Best Year;
Correction on Hockey Story

OUR SPIES TELL US that Ben Grady, the new swimming coach,
is counting on a big season for his splashers (there is an almost irre-
sistible desire to  “tankers” but the connotations are scarcely
ﬂattering). One of the reasons for Grady’s soaring hopes  Al
Beacon, senior and one of the four boys who transferred from Fifth
Avenue high school to Trees Gym pool a few years back.

Beacon ’s only problem is a lack of conﬁdence. A fine swimmer
with plenty of what the boys call “guts,’ Al has never quite come
up to his possibilities. But the word is out that this is his year. "With
big Al up front, the Pitt swimmers would be in a ﬁne spot to step
into national prominence, and the only thing that would keep Beacon
out of consideration for the Olympics would be their cancellation.

WE UNDERSTAND THE MANAGEMENT of Duquesne Garden
objected in no small way to the story which appeared in The News
announcing the discontinuation of Pitt hockey, or rather they ob-
jected to the headline.

The body of the story gave as one of the reasons for the discon-
tinuation “lack of facilities.” The headline mentioned “poor facili-
ties.” It seems that the Garden guiding lights considered the head-
line a slight to their arena. If such was the case, we apologize. The
reason was indisputably “lack of facilities.”

To forestall future complaints of a similar nature, we might add
that headlines are subject to space limitations. The words which ﬁt
best, though still giving the general idea of the story, are the words
which‘ are usedin the headline. Please address all further grievances
to the copy desk. I

The Duquesne Duke Is Sore;
No Problem for Kristufek

PITT HAS BROKEN OFF basketball relations with Duquesne.
Pitt‘ has broken of football relations with Duquesne. Pitt has broken
off hockey relations with Duquesne. The Duqiiesne Duke, official
student newspaper of Duquesne University, is sore. Need we say
more?

_ IN A RELEASE FROM LOYOLA University of Los Angeles,
we notice that coach Mike Pecarovich has worked out a series of
plays which, if executed properly, make for perfect deception. Pe-
carovich says that “the only defense against this new attack is to
tackle every man in the backﬁeld.”

That would offer no new problem to Frank Kristufek, beefy
Pitt senior tackle. Frank, who’ wears strong glasses off the ﬁeld,
has trouble enough seeing the ball carrier on an ordinary play, but
on a reverse, he’s completely stumped. Consequently, all season he ’s
been tackling “every man in the backﬁeld.” Says Frank, “One
of them must have the ball.”

Pretty Girls Declared Good
Advertisement for University

GIRLS, MOST GIRLS ANYWAY, are a good. advertisement, par-
ticularly if they are pretty girls. They are just as good an adver-
tisement for a University as for a, tube of tooth paste. For some
reason, this fact has never been taken into consideration at Pitt. To
be exact, we refer to the absence of girl cheerleaders.

VVe will dismiss the theory that Pitt has no pretty girls. After a
thorough personal investigation, we decided that the charge is bas-
ically false and libelous. VVhether those girls would make good
cheerleaders is another point. But when we reach that stage, we al-
ways say “what of it?”

Good cheerleaders or no good cheerleaders, We believe that a
pretty girl has a certain amount of inspirational value. One pretty
girl standing absolutely still will stir the heart far more than a dozen
masculine gymnasts bending themselves into grotesque shapes ‘and
bursting their lungs shouting.

Then there is the team to be considered. In our long associa-
tion with football teams, we have yet to ﬁnd one which gave two
cents worth of hoot about male cheerleaders. But‘ if, after a particu-
larly vicious block, one of the boys were to look up into a pair of big
blue eyes that plead with him to get in there and ﬁght, the chances
are much greater that‘ he will get in there and ﬁght.

Of course, the chances are even greater that he ’ll walk off the
ﬁeld altogether, but if he does that, we refuse to be held responsible
for anything that might happen.’ Still, it ’s at least‘ Worth a try.

See Big Season

With 17 tough games staring them 4

in their collective faces, a squad of
15 basketball players are up in the
Stadium these days screening, block-
ing, dribbling, shooting and general-
ly intent on making coach Dr. Cliff
Carlson’s “win ’em all” battle cry
more of an actuality than it has been
in recent seasons.

While Carlson lost only one man
by graduation, Eddy Lawry, sopho-
mores Paffrath and Reeves failed to
return. Paffrath led the squad in
scoring last year, despite his incon-
sistant play.

To more than compensate for the
loss, four sophomores and a senior
will ﬁll the vacancies. Eddie Ziol-
kowski and Jim Egan, scoring stars
of the 1938-39 yearling team, are
outstanding contenders for varsity
spots, while Collins and Levine, both
eﬁicient defensive men, are in line
for leading reserve positions.

Senior Charley Ptacek is the other
newcomer. Out of both his sopho-
more and junior years with sickness,
-the former Connolly ace will be used
chieﬂy as a spot player.

injuries, a state line averaging 198
pounds, a backﬁeld ﬁguring up to
180, and a bagful of typical Penn
State tricks. Remember those sleep-
ers?

Sid Alter, who grabbed a pass for
a lone State score two years ago, is
around at end again this year, cap-
taining the team. Lloyd Ickes, an
Altoona product, is back again at full-
back, still chuckfull of running. He
tore off 65 yards against Army last
week for a touchdown.

Harry Harrison is gone, but his
prototype, Petrella, will see some
action; like Harrison, he is the fastest
man on the squad and ranks in the
160-pound weight group. Steve Rol-
lins is another shifty halfback.

Capable reserve strength will be on
State’s side when the teams line up,
for the ﬁrst and second State teams
are on a par.

An addition to the injured list,
Bobby 'I‘hurbon, will be offset by the
return of Cassiano to active duty for
the Panthers. Frank Kristufek, whose

ries of Matisi and Quatse, is bother-
ed with a battered hip but should be

in shape by Saturday.

The old-standbys on the hospital
list, are in varying degrees of recu-
peration. Kish, Dickinson, and, of
course, Fullerton are deﬁnitely out,
but Bonelli and Konetsky, particular-
ly the former, are expected to get
back in. against the Lions.

With the offensive exhibition turn-
ed in by George Kracum last Satur-
day, the Panthers should be well-
stocked in the halfback department.
Eddie Jones will be around to back
him up. Then, there’s the usual
Cassiano-Narick combine.

Although the Nebraska game was
a loss, so far as the score was con-
cerned, coach Charley Bowser un-
earthed three ﬁnds who make 1940
prospects a little brighter. Harry
Kindelberger and John Stahl, sopho-
more tackle and end respectively,
played in their ﬁrst varsity game with
more than indifferent success.

To ﬁll the kicking void left by
Kish’s injury, guard Rudy Gradisek
was pulled out of the line on third or
fourth down and given. the punting
assignment. He wound up with an
average of better than 37 yards from
scrim.ma.¢ze, Pitt’s best of the year.

KAYWOODIE   *4

In this Kaywoodie pipe, called the Car-
buretor Kaywoodie, a wonderfully sweet-
smoking pipe has been improved by the
application of a neat little principle of
physics. When you take a puff at one of
these Carburetor Kaywoodies, you auto-
matically dnzw air in through a tiny inlet
in the bottom of the bowl. That incom- ’
ing air keeps the smoke cool, sweet and
serene, no matter how belligerently you
puﬁ‘. In fact, the harder you puff, the
more air comes in. That’s why it’s called
a Caréziretor Kaywoodic. Everybody
knows that a Kaywooclie is the most so-
cially-conscious of pipes—gets itself ad-
mired cverywhere. And the Kaywoodie -
Flavor is famous. But don’t let us urge

H eister’ s Head

Injury Declared

‘Not Serious’

Freshman Grid Squad

Expected to Produce
Varsity Material in ’40

Jack Heister, ﬁrst-string center on
Pitt’s freshman grid squad who was
injured in last Friday's contest
_against Kiski, is resting comfortably
in St. Francis hospital, according to
Dr. Paul Zehfuss, freshman trainer.

It is believed that while Heister
suffered a slight brain concussion,
his injury is not serious. However,
X-rays have been taken and a brain
specialist will be consulted to deter-
mine the exact extent of the damage.
A Heister was accidentally kicked in
the head early in the second quarter
of the Kiski game, but continued to
snap the ball back perfectly. How-
ever, his team mates noted his dazed
condition late in the period, and act-
ing captain Vince Anania sent him
from the ﬁeld. The former Aspinwall
snapper-back rested in the inﬁrmary
at Kiski over the week-end.

I-Ieister was one of the main springs
on the yearling outﬁt this fall. This
year's freshman team, while only
breaking even in four games, showed
promise of moving into varsity berths
in a year or two.

Given two seasons of intensive
training and practice, at least eleven
men on the Blue and Gold frosh
squad should be capable of handling
ﬁrst or second string varsity assign-
ments.

Several freshman are determined
to win starting spots for the 1940 pig-
skin campaign, and while it is doubt-
ful whether any sophomores will be
in the starting line-up against Mis-
souri next October 5, the scrappy
yearlings mean to try for front-line
positions.

Penn State’s little Lions were the
ﬁrst opponent for Pitt. The boys
from Mt. Nittany trounced the little
Panthers, 25-0, but had the reserves
held as well as the starters, the
Staters would not have won by more
than a single touchdown.

In their second battle, the frosh
met West Virginia’s little Mountain-
eers. The Mountaineers also took Pitt,
25-(), but intercepted passes and a
blocked punt set up three of the four
West Virginia six-pointers.

The Carnegie plebes furnished the
opposition in the third frosh encount-
er. The ﬁrst-year men made up for
their previous defeats with a Ven-
geance by walloping the Skibos, 47-0.
Had the ﬁrst team seen a little more
action, the score would have been
even higher.

In their ﬁnal fray against Kiski,
the freshman had to overcome an
acute attack of overconﬁdence to eke
out a 13-12 victory over the Preppers.
After scoring their ﬁrst touchdown,
the gridders began to loaf, and with-
in a few minutes the ﬁghting Kiski-
men pushed over two quick scores.

Fortunately, both attempts to con-
vert failed, and a last quarter touch-
down pass, followed by Marty Var-
daro’s placement kick, won the game
for the Panthers.

Last Time

 

harriers met with accident on the

and alack, they were in the list of
also-rans.
Sterner Eighty-Fourth

Captain Walt Sterner, of whom
great things had been predicted,
had ﬁnished in the eighty-fourth
slot in the snai1’s time of 29:49,
over three full minutes behind the
winner. Inprevious meetings Cap-
tain Zeke has conquered 22 of the
front 25, and last year
seventh place in the ICAAAA meet.

Al Boulanger, ICAAAA two-mile
king and brilliant running mate of
Sterner, defeated his captain for the
ﬁrst time, but crossed the line in
forty-ﬁrst place. He apparently was

1938 in his scoring position, inter-
changing a 14 with a 41.

Frank McCabe was Pitt’s best man
in this ill-starred race, but even he
was far below his normal self. Last
year he was a good twentieth; this
race he was thirty-ﬁfth.

Others Bunched

The other members of the Blue
and Gold outﬁt came in before sun-
down, but barely beat Old Sol.’s de-
scent. The boys weren’t very far
apart, indicating that they were at
least trying to stick together.

Bob Graham was eighty-second;
Sterner, eighty-fourth; Louis Man'-
uwal, eighty-eighth; John Brosky,
ninety-ﬁrst; Warren Roseborough,
ninety—third.

In team scoring the Panthers
compiled a grand total of 321 points,
as against the winner’s total of 42,
and their own 1938 mark of 95. Yale

eked out a four-point margin, in
edging the local thinclads for
twelfth.

From a national standpoint, the
thirty-ﬁrst annual ICAAAA cross
country meet was a huge success.
The entry list swelled over last year,
and the competition was keener.

MacMitchell Wins

Leslie MacMitchell, brilliant New
York University sophomore, won his
twenty-second (scholastic and col-
legiate) consecutive cross country
run. Striding at the front of the
pack virtually all the way, Mac-
Mitchell sped over the exacting ﬁve
mile route in 26:28.6, the fastest
time recorded on the tortuous course

State-Army Stalemate Shatters
-Bertram’s Clean Slate for Week

By Bertram I. Jace

. We won and lost last Saturday when the Nebraska Cornhuskers out-
extra-pointed the Golden Panthers, 14-13.

This column predicted a Nebraska victory but rooted hard for a blue
and gold triumph which failed to materialize.

Our predictions almost hit 100 per cent last week the lone exception

from the Win column being the Penn

ners in the other six games playede

looked well in the percentage column.
‘ This week we revert to picking the
Panthers to win. Dick Cassiano is
expected back at the left halfback
position with such capable replace-
ments as George “Sure I’m good”

ready to go in at a moment’s notice.

The Staters have been playing
bang-up ball the last few weeks,
turning back Penn, 10-0, and holding
the Cadets to a 14-14 deadlock.
However, the smart money has made
Pitt a 10-7 favorite, and we agree for
a change.

Lookpfor Pitt’s seniors to go out in
a blaze of glory and a victory over
Penn State.

Pitt 13, Penn State 7
 ‘The city championship will be de-

atempts to hand the Duquesne eleven
its initial defeat of the season and
throw the city title into a three way
affair.

Duquesne rested last week in
preparation for this game and will
enter the battle as the favorites.

Tech did everything except out-
score Holy Cross last Saturday in los-
ing, 21-0. The statistics gave the
Tartans a decided advantage over Joe
Sheeketski’s gridders, but Bill Osman-
ski’s kid brother lugged the leather
for two long touchdown runs and a
Holy Cross win.

We like the Tartans Saturday.
Kern has been pointing for this game
and would like to spoil the Dukes’
perfect record.

Tech 7, Duquesne 0

Nebraska ﬁnally defeated Pitt, but
last week’s win won’t help them

against the Oklahoma Sooners. The

State-Army tie. Otherwise, six win-
Sooners were undefeated until last
week when the MissouriTigers won a
one point victory from them.

Both Nebraska and Oklahoma have
lost one game and Missouri was the
conquerer of each. (And Pitt opens
with Missouri next year). This game
would call for the coin ﬂipping, but
the sports editor‘ swiped the penny,
and we have to guess the outcome.
(That’s nothing new.)

Nebraska looks like a cinch with
such an array of backﬁeld talent, but
the Sooners have a better all-round
team.

Oklahoma 13, Nebraska 7

Poor Temple is in for another de-
feat at the hands of Michigan State.
The Owls have been playing good ball
all year, but Swan doesn’t have a
scoring punch. The Michigan aggre-
gation should win if old man upset
doesn’t poke his nose into things.

Michigan State 20, Temple 6

On the west coast Washington en-
gages Oregon in what will more than
likely be a close battle. After a bad
start, the Phelan coached outﬁt has
hit its stride and will take Oregon.

Washington 14, Oregon 7

Duke appears to have a breather
this week in North Carolina State.
But remember, the North Carolinians
put up a tough scrap against Du-
quesne and held the locals to a single
touchdown. Wade’s outﬁt will win,
but it won’t be a walk-away.

Duke 14, North Carolina State 0

This terminates the predictions for
the year and at the present time, our
average stands at .678 which places
us ahead of “adjective slinger” Frank

First reports from New York included the ﬁrst twenty-ﬁve run-

Later reports proved all these suppositions groundless, for the

Fellow New Yorker Larry Moriar-

second, sixth, ninth, tenth, and ﬁf-

Willy Smith, the defending in-
