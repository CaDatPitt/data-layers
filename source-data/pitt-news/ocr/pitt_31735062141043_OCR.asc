 

Bernadette Blatt ascended to the Senior
Queen throne Wednesday to become the
first senior woman in 16 years named
queen during a single event conducted just
for that purpose. .

Nancy Crawford, C42, sharing senio
woman honors, was named Alma Mater
during a ceremony preceeding the Com-
mons room tea.

While the University organist played
“Alma Mater,” aides hunted through a
crowded Commons room for Miss Craw-
ford and escorted her to a “throne.”

Miss Blatt then was sought in the audi-
ence by aides carrying pink and gold ban-
ners, traditional Senior Queen colors, and
led to her place on the balcony.

The Senior Queen was elected by women
of the senior class, March 11. Coronation

'” will take place April 25.

After the ceremony Wednesday, tea was
served by Mrs. J. K. Miller, hostess in the
Commons room.

For 16 years the naming of Senior Queen
has been part of the Tap Day program,
but this year because of the accelerated
program the date of announcement was

 

 

advanced.

Personality sketches of Miss Blatt and
Miss Crawford may be found on page four.

To Run For SFA

Non—fraternity students, meeting at the Independent ‘  

party convention Wednesday, decided that the party will en-
ter the spring elections to vote for the equal representation
amendment and to contest the fraternity candidates for SFA.

Hiram Milton, C42, explained that this move, a contra-
diction to the previous Independent threat not to run, was

Panther On Sale
Today; Features

 ‘Military Ball

Tonight’s Military ball and Pitt's
twenty most desirable people to be
with in a blackout will be featured
in the latest issue of the Panther,
reportedly on sale today.

The twenty blackout-coupies
were selected by some weird, com-

" plex method-———a committee of four-

teen men selected ten women, and
a committee of ‘fourteen women se-
lected ten men.

Still selling at 15 centavos, this
issue of the Panther will contain
more pictures than has any other
recent issue of the magazine, ac-
cording to Dave Naley, C43, editor.

“Undercover,” written by Tom
Barr, C42, when he isn’t busy with
“Pittpourri,” will be in the Panther
as usual, exposing the after—class
doings of the Tuck shop set.

Pictures of the ROTC biggies
will be included in today’s issue as
part of the story on tonight’s dance.

The opening of the new Zeta
Tau Alpha fraternity house will he
presented in one of the Panther-’s
stories. Allegedly the most beauti-
ful house on campus, its dedication
will be covered in today’; mag-
azino.

Included too in the Panther are
the usual features—0n Campus,
(from the Pitt News column of the
same name) the usual ﬁction sec-
tion, and the other regular depart-
ments. B

made since SFA agreed to let the

plebiscite result take place imme- ,

diately, instead o‘f delaying its ef-
fect. The anticipated delay had
precipitated the Independent walk-
out and now-rescinded threat not
to run.

Unlike former years, slates of

nominees will not be formed. [no . .

stead, Independent candidates will
petition for nomination and con-
duct individual campaigns.

“The main object of the Inde-
pendents should be' to push the
amendment through. Thus, each
candidate will not only campaign
for his election, but will ask also
all his supporters to vote “yes”
on the amendment,” Hiram Milton,
C42, Independent leader, said.

Both Milton and Aldo lcardi,

C43, top party men, emphasized-’
insist to"

that candidates should
their supporters that equal repre-
sentation rather than
seats in SFA would be the major
issue in this year’s election.

Groups Continue H   C it

During ‘Summer

Student activities groups will
continue during the summer, Dr.
Frank Shockley, director of the
summer semester, disclosed today.

Activities leaders and faculty at]-
visers already are making‘ plans for
the summer program, he said. No
announcements have been made
concerning the extent of each ac-
tivity’: program, but complete pro-
grams are expected soon.

The deans of men and women,
who will meet with Dr. Shockley
after reports from various activ-
ities, will supervise activities dur-
ing all three semesters.

The following letter was received from Private
Karl Stark, graduated from the University in
1940. , § » .
Well known at Pitt, Stark was named to the Pitt
,0 lHall of Fame before his graduation. In his under-
’. graduate days, he was one ‘of the leaders of a
0 strong Independent party, star of the Pitt Cap and
Gown‘ show, and ‘a. member of the debating team.
. _IIe was also tapped to Omicron Delta Kappa.
‘Shortly after beinggradaated in the spring of
1940, Stark was called for selective service. He is
now serving with the A. E. F. in Iceland.
‘ Writtenon the Atlantic ocean enroute to Ice-
land, this letter is one example of the spirit of
.0 young men ﬁghting forthe preserpvationl ofthings

y I. was up looking at the water. No more than
that.‘-'I‘he deep blue ‘endless water. The sea is ‘»a
fgreath-uge peaceful, thing. In’ ‘its sloth it breeds
fear ‘and love and respect. And soldiers _line the
-railgand somehow take in part of its grossnessé-—
soldiers out of their _element and yet’ as one with
«the sea. Great and huge and peaceful.

.0 ' And I think as long as the boys from the farms
in ‘Indiana, and the horses in Montana, and the
peanut farms in Virginia, and from the lathes in

 A Soldir 1.. Iceland.

Pennsylvania, have to cross the sea to do their

ﬁghting, just so long will they be great and huge.

and peaceful. And just as thereis nothing in the
world to compare with the sea. when it rumbles
and moves, so there}-is nothing toicyompare to what
these men stand fo»r’-rwhen IT  and moves.

And I think, my boy, we’re-‘inn-viing. When He
says 100,000 planes, 110,000 sprotI:weld«ers will burn
out 100,000 riveters. And when He. says 75,000
tanks, we’ll see them in Russia, and China, and
Australia——and maybe in Berlin. Everywhere
you’ll see “Made in U.S.A.” Have you ever been
thrilled at that’ sign? Have a little tingle run up

and down your back because afnian can say, “By "
God, that’s mine.” We’re big. We’re bigger than

anything in the worlcl-—except

the s.ea——a.nd- we
control ‘that; ‘ ' 

  

"There’s a strahge thing"’hér .’ No man here
knows where we go. No man knows how many‘
days after tomorrow there maybe. A man’s life
may have run its course’; a man may have passed
his youth, his middle age, and his quiet last years
all in the space of twenty-odd years or so, and yet.
there is no fear. No man wants to die, and no man
hates life. And no man dreamsof anything but;
home, good food, women. And no man will go

. down without a helluva lot of lead. And George,’

my friend, says, “No friend of mine will get hurt

if I can help it. And everybody here is my friend.”

They talk about the “fanatical bravery” of the
Japanese-——suicide squads. But there’s not a man
who doesn’t know there’s not a job they can do
and die that We can’t do and live. There’s not a

'man who doesn’t know that he’s sent out to live,
not die. Do the job and come back. This

thing
you ﬁght for ‘is life, not death. ‘ 1

And no man questions whether we ﬁght for de-
mocracy or to end war or to rid the world of a
Hitler. They know only that we ﬁght, and for the
time that is enough. To know more is to consider
and weigh and judge. And to consider and weigh
and judgeis to think, and thinking men do_ not

.ﬁght..W_hat they ﬁghtfor is much bigger, much

greater, much more precious: Knowledge.

And thatls where I ﬁnd me, I’m a ﬁghting man.
What time there will befor thinking will be my
matching my skill and will to live against his. And
by God, Pm the better. man; Remember?

Well, what do you think? It’s really nice. outta

this afternoon.

The Phi Kaps and Phi Gains ﬁnished‘ one—two in last
year’s top-slot Intramural mushball race, both are ﬁelding
Veteran nines, and each is rated an equal chance to cop the

crown, in the supremacy battl

just getting underway. *
In the contest, to be played on

the Shadysideﬁeld at 3:80 o’clock,

Frank Dax and Mike Sotack of the ’

Phi Kappa c-rew will be pitting sea-
soned skills against those offered
by "experienced Fijis strategists,
Bil1cColvin, John Bitner, and Bob
Quick. “ ,

However, desperation seems‘ to
be the keynote of the PhijEp-Phi
Deli contest, number two fracas on
todayis mushball calendar.‘ Both
groups have been stripped of vet-
eran talent, and will be forced to
rely chieﬂy on untried freshman
potentialities. ‘

Only Arny Biron‘; Alex‘Zelenski,
and Jimmy Deutelbaum remain to
bolster Phi Ep morale. Of the three,
Deutelbaum alone revealed a
touch of superiority in Phi Ep-

Practice,- Dutton to Play  

After enjoying perfect spring
weather last Tuesday, Pitt’s grid—
iron hopefuls ran into a biting wind
the following day when they con-
tinued spring drills. The weather
for the second day of practice was
more like that of a typical mid-
November afternoon; ~, instead-
mid-March.

However, thevcoaching staff sent
the entire , squad through a stiff
workout. The drills consisted main-
ly of running through various play
formations and getting the winter
“kinks” out of the players’ bodies."
Therernainder of._ this ‘week will
probably be the _same_ with scrim-.
maging starting‘ n_ext week, to be
followed by intria-squad games.

One of head coach C_h_arlie Bow-
ser’s big headaches was cleared up
when halfback -Bill Dutton an-
announced his intention of. enlist-
ing in the Naval Reserve next
Monday. Dutton declared that he
had already taken his first Army
physical examination and would
have been called up for duty in
thenear future. By joining the
Naval Reserve he will be able to
stay in school until "he graduates.

~ Loss of Dutton or any other key

man from an already under-manned
_ backﬁeld would create a‘ hole ‘in
“the Panther squad "that "Bowser

of

would find hard to fill. With 

x

prospect of another tough schedule:

’ in view for next fall, Bowser will

need every available player on the

team.

What these college students won’t do to get their
pictures in the paper, was probably a passing thought
of Bigelow boulevard pedestrians, who were seen
shaking their heads reproachfully Wednesday after-
noon‘ at about 4‘ o’clock.

.What they saw were two slim young ladies, a

V blonde and a brunette, each holding her skirt in

deﬁance of'a strong wind, and looking down into a
camera from—of all places—the balustrade of the
boulevard-side porch of the Cathedral.

What the passers-by didn’t know was: Pitt had
just selected its Senior Queen.-elect and her Alma
Mater-—Bernadette Blatt, C, and Nancy Crawford,
C, respectively.

as as :1:

“Bernie” Blatt is the honest type of a gal who,

i when you ask her what she wants to do when she

graduates says “Getrmarried, of course.”

Further proof of her unaffectedness was her reply
to the next question. “Outside interests? Oh, I'm
one of those disgusting people who have no hobbies.”

Which might all lead to the incorrect assumption
that Bernie was a poor choice for the highest honor
that can be given to a University woman.

But it is just this frankness and sincerity, blended
with a dash of sophistication, that has made her
popular with faculty and student body alike. And
her interests have been centered around the Uni-
versity, which accounts for her lack of time to devote
to outside activities. ‘

Of all the honors that have come to her at the
University, and have made her “hate to leave here,”
Wednesday’s announcement, she contends, was the
“most exciting and least expected.”

Last summer, Bernie worked in the Law library.
but most of her vacations have -been spent just hav-
ing a general good time, ghe declared.

Bernadette’s activities at school included member-
ship in Phi Alpha Theta, honorary history frater-
nity, Pi Tau Phi, honorary college scholastic frater-
nity, as well as being a delegate to Intercollegiate
Conference on Government during her first two
years. »

THE campus favorite is Camel-the cigarette with less nicotine in
the smoke! Yes, country-wide surveys show that Amer_ica’s favor-
1tc cigarette ranks first with college students, too.

You’ll ﬁnd the answer when you try Camels yourself. From the first
puli right through the last put? in the pack—and pack after pack-
Camels give you the ﬂavorful smoking you like with the mildness
that lets you enjoy it! So make it a point to try Camels--the milder
cigarette with less nicotine in the smoke.

Queen . . . .Alma Mater

When she was a freshman, the queen-elect was
chairman of the Public Speaking unit, and a mem-
ber of Freshman Council. Her sophomore year saw
her tapped to Cwens, honorary activities organiza-
tion, and made WSGA representative from her class,
in addition to being given a seat in WSGA Execu-
tive council. '

She was adviser to the Books and Plays unit while
a junior, and a member of WSGA Commission.

Her list of honor: was completed when, during
her senior year, she was made a member of Senior
Court, and chairman of the Unit Advisory council.

4: as as
Pitt senior women carried through their choice of
the “natural” type of coed when they elected Nancy
Crawford Alma Mater.

Nancy is the ideal all-around type.

Supplied with a generous amount of good looks,
she nevertheless has maintained a high scholastic
average, participated in numerous University ac-
tivities, and can tell the center from the halfback on
any man’s football ﬁeld.

The well-proportioned, blonde Alma Mater is an
English major, insists that her plans for the future
consist chieﬂy of getting a job.

In keeping with her individuality——which, inci-
dentally, never becomos eccentricity—her hobby is
collecting Gody fashion plates, the pictures of nine-
teenth-century women’: styles as revealed by Cody's
Lady Books of that period.

“I was more or less driven into that hobby," Nancy
admitted. “I have so darn much old furniture that I
decided I ought to have pictures to go with it."

Nancy, the daughter of Dr. Stanton C. Crawford,
Dean of the College, and Mrs. Crawford, of the D'Ar-
lington apartments, Edgewood, graduated from
Edgewood High School in 1938. She was chairman
of WSGA Customs committee during her junior
year, and is now a member of Senior Court, presi-
dent of Mortar Board, honorary activities fraternity,
and secretary of Kappa Alpha Theta, social fra-
ternity.
