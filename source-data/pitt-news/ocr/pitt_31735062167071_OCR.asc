Langstaff Alledgedly Leaving University   

by PAL- Q10 LER

Informed sources have told The
Pitt News conﬂicting reports con-
cerning the employment status of
John Langstaff, director of Auxilia-
ry Enterprises.

Assistant to the Chancellor Jack Free-
man said that he “can’t confirm or deny”
the alleged report. “There is no truth that
he has been fired. He may have decided
that it was better for all concerned to give
up his position with the University,” he
said.

A more definite position was taken by
Vice-Chancellor for Finance Edison Mont-
gomery. Mr. Montgomery ﬂatly denied
the alleged report of Mr. Langstaff’s dis-
missal. “I deny that he has been fired.”

The I

Treasurer of the Un.'.-._..y David Smith,
on the other hand, presented The Pitt
News with contrary evidence on Mr. Lang-
staff’s status.

He stated that Langstaff had “made
arrangements with Mr. Montgomery.”
Langstaff “is looking for another job, def-
initely.”

Mr. Smith did not know when Mr.
Langstaff would leave the University.
“How soon this will be is up in the air,”
stated Mr. Smith.

When asked about Mr. Langstaff own-
ership of Your Campus Store, Mr. Smith
stated that “he (Langstaff) can do what-
ever he wants with the Campus Store.”

Mr. Smith admitted that Langstaff is

“not very long with the University. But

he was given reasonable time to llnd an-
other job.”

A student response was given to The
Pitt News by Howard Ainisman, former
Student Government Vice-President. He
was also The Pitt News reporter who orig-_
inally uncovered Mr. Langstaff’s dual ca-
pacity as Director of Auxiliary Enterpris-
es and owner of Your Campus Store.

“I was not aware that Langstaff was
leaving the University. If this is true,”
said Ainisman, “it restores the credibility
of the Business Affairs area of the Uni-
versity.”

Ainisman asserted that “its about time
that most of the Litchfield appointees
should leave.”

He also maintained that “it is repre-

  

hensible that Langstaff was not asked to
eliminate his conflict of interest between
the Bookcenter and Your Campus Store
until now.”

“If his leaving is definite, I am proud
to say that this is a victory for the stu-
dents,” said Ainisman.

He related his experience of sitting on
the Bookcenter Committee that had dis-
cussions over the summer concerning the
proposed ten percent across the board stu-
dents,” said Ainisman.

“Having the dubious honor of sitting
on the Bookcenter Committee with the
Vice-Chancellor for Finance, I saw first
hand how the poor management of the
Bookcenter was not discussed in an open
and frank manner,” said Ainisman.

Tap Day Ceremonies Men’s Council Out Of Limbo’,

To Be Held Wednesday
In the S U Ballroom

The annual Tap Day ceremonies will be held Wednes-
day at 4 p.m. in the SU Ballroom. The program will feature
the presentation of the following awards: Mr. and Miss Pitt,
ODK and of the Yetzr, the senior worthies, and the Druids
Sophomore and Junior Men of the Year. Linda Goldstein,
editor-in-chief of The Pitt News, will deliver the keynote

address.

Following the Tap Day ceremonies, there will be a recep-
tion for the University community in the Marble Lounge.

A dinner will be held at 6:30
p.m. in the Supper Room for the
top awardees. The Tap Day Ban-
quet speakers will be Armand
Belly, president of the William
Pitt Debating Union, and Law-
rence Lee, professor of English.

“We urge as many students
who are able to attend the Tap
Day ceremonies," stated Tap
Day Chairman Paul Stoller.
“Many students are under the
misconception that on-ly those
who are tapped to an honorary
are supposed to attend Tap Day;
this is not the case. Ta.p Day is
for the entire University com-
munity, as it is the one day in
the year that students receive
University-wide recognition for
outstanding contributions in
in both scholastic and extracur-
ricular activities.”

Constitution Year In Works

by DAN BOOKER

Men’s Council (MC), which as operated inlimbo for a year, is close to regaining the full
recognition is lost when it was attacked last February as inbred and unrepresentative. The new
structure -o-f MC, as outlined in the constitution calls for a m-em-bership with equal representation
from the Commuter Association, Men’s Dorm Council, and Interfraternity Council.

Dave Ehrenwerth, MC president, explained, “The criticism of last year was valid but we think

we have corrected the situatio

campus organization."

n and that we are again -in a position to assume our role as a major

He added that, in the last week, the three constituent groups of the new MC approved the
constitution hammered out over the past term by the presidents of the three groups and him-
self. This constitution will now go to the Student Government (SG) Recognitions Committee. Mem-
bers of the Recognitions Committee will be chosen Th-ursday night at the SG meeting.

Ehrenwerth pointed out that the Recognitions Committee liked the draft of the constitution
when it was presented in October. “They fully endorsed it at that time,” he said. “I don't see any

School, as visiting professor of
theatre arts. “My ﬁrst interest
is teaching liberal arts students
interested in drama, and I’m en-
joying the chance to do that
here. At Yale, I've been work-
ing principally with the grad-
uate students,” he said.

In the past he has directed
Hamlet, Macbeth, and Julius
Caesar at Amherst College and

Yale University. One of his"

groups from Amherst gave a
performance of Caesar in the

ﬁrst Shakespearean play given
live on television.

“The drama company here at
the University has a rather uni-
que situation,” Dr. Canﬁeld stat-
ed. “The company has experi-
enced actors of professional
standing.

“For instance, we're very for-
tunate to have an actor of John
Krich’s capabilities to play the
character of Prospero,” he went
on to say. “In fact, there are
quite a few people from Yale
on the staff here. Wandalie Hen-
shaw, Bob Cothran and Cynthia
Krich are some of these. Being
among friends and former stu-
dents makes a happy situation
for me,” he added.

“We have some extremely
talented students in acting here
at the University,” Dr. Canﬁeld
remarked,‘ “but we ought to
have more. It may be a matter
of time, because it does take
time to put on a show profes-
sionally. It also may be the pres-
sure of the trimester system,”
he said.

Dr. Canﬁeld is presently di-
recting The Tempest, scheduled
to open soon in the Stephen Fos-
ter Auditorium. “We're having
a lot of fun doing The Tempest,”
Dr. Canﬁeld said. “It's a fun
play because it's one of Shakes-
peare's happy plays. It's a pas-
toral romance telling of the
benevolence and acceptance of
life. The Tempest is satisfying
to work on especially since the
world is in such a sorry state
these days. It brings the theatre

trouble in getting re-recognized.”

Under the new structure, MC
is divided into two branches, a
Men’s Advisory Board and a
Men’-s Judicial Review Board.
The Advisory Board will be re-
sponsi.ble for the “establishment,
coordination, and evaluation of
extracurricular pro g ra m min g
beneﬁcial to the male student
body. They shall also make rec-
ommendations to the adminis-
tration, faculty, SG and other
organizations concerning the
male students’ we1fare.”

This 15-member Board will
handle MC programs such as
the Freshman Orientation Host
Program, Freshman Camp,
Freshman Council, the Activ-
ities Fair, Draft Symposi-u-ms,
t-he Upperclass Advisor Program
and the Men’s Loan Fun. Ehren-
werth noted that this body would
take policy stands on issues af-
fecting all men, such as the
draft, and would work to sup-
port programs of the constitu-
ent groups, such as fraternity
housing.

The Judicial Review Board
would be composed of two mem-
bers and one alternate member
from each of the constituent or-
ganizations. According to the
constitution, the members of
the Board will be “charged with
the impartial evaluation of male
students charged with personal
misconduct or rule violations.”

The Review Board would only
hear cases of personal miscon-
duct and/or rule violation rec-
ommended to them by the Dean
of Men or his representative. It
will have authority only to rec-
ommend action to the Dean of
Men and will not hear appeals
from MDC or IEC judicila de-
cisions. , . , —

“We haven't tried to distort
The Tempest to make it mod-

some of the language has been
updated. We took some of the

Government Budgets Again Tiglttened
Defense Department Reduce Grants

NASA,

by WALTER GRANT

WASHINGTON (CPS) ——Trou-
bels may be just beginning for
university graduate students
and professors who depend on
the Defense Department and the
space agency for fellio-wships and
funding pf research projects.

The Federal Government’s bud,-
get problems have forced both
the Pentagon and the National
Aeronautics and Space Admin-
istration to reduce support to
universities during the current
ﬁscal year. And the outlook for
ﬁscal 1969 is not much brighter.

Although some universities
are already feeling the pinch,
most will not feel the full im-
pact of the decrease in ﬁancial
sup-port until April or May, ac-
cording to an official in the
Pentagon’s office of research

and engineering.

The budget cuts are having
a wide variety of effects on uni-
versities. Some graduate schools
may be forced to accept fewer
students next fall due to the
lack of fellowships and research
opportunities. Faculty hiring at
some graduate schools is at a.
standstill, and many more
schools will be unable to sup-
port faculty and student re-
search projects this summer.

Private schools with little or
no endowments will be hurt
more than some large state uni-
versities, like the Universities of
Michigan and California, which
are heavily endowed. Some of
the major private universities
like Stanford and Harvard also
have large endowments which
will help offset the loss of fed-
eral support.

Overall, University-“based re-
search in the Defense Depart-
ment has been reduced to $238
million for 1968, compared to
$261 million in ﬁscal 1967 and
$299 in 1966. Of the $23 million
reduction this year, about $20
million will come from the area
of basic research, deﬁned by the
Pentagon as projects “seeking
to develop new knowledge.” The
smaller .a~mount——a.bout $3 mil-
lion~—will come from applied re-
search, which includes most of
the classiﬁed research projects
in universities sponsored by the
Defense Department.

In the space agency, the spend-
ing reduction wil lhave more
effect on graduate fellowships
than on research. NASA gave
750 predoctoral three-year fel-
lowships in 1967, but will be
able to give only 75 this year.
The overall NASA program of
support to universities has been
c11t from about $117 million in
1967 to less than $100 million

c-ial said. NASA’s sustaining  ,

versity program was cut from
$30 million to $10 million.

The budget cuts have been
caused primarily by the Viet-
nam war, which is eating up a
large portion of the federal bud-
get. Since the war is expected
to continue at least at the pre-
sent level during ﬁscal 1969 and
possibly at an escalated level,
universities are not expecting

-any relief when the new ﬁscal

year begins this coming July.
If Congress accepts the John-
son Administrat.ion’s budget rec-
ommendation, for NASA, the
amount of university support in
1969 will be comparable to the
reduced level of this year. NASA
would again be able to offer
only about 75 predoctoral fel-
lowships, and the suis-taining uni-

versity program would receive

only $10 million.

Pentagon officials say they '

search. However, the Adminis-
tration is requesting an increase
of about $90 milﬁon for the en-
tire research program in the
Defense Department. On Penta-
gon otficial predicted about one-
third of this amount, of $30 mil-
lion, would go to universities.

In this case, university-based
research for the Pentagon would
be increased to about the 1967
level. But costs have been going
up, and a dollar in 1969 will not

go as far as a dollar in 1967.

Thus, even if universities re-
ceive a $30 million increase, the
overall program level still 
be down.

Congress, however, is in at ﬁs-
cally conservative mood, and
mo-st observers expect signiﬁ-
cant reductions in the Adminis-
tration’s budget request. Re-
search funds. frequently are cut

by Congress, because many Con-.__

gressmen think some research
projects are duplicated and are
irrelevant.

{go 4 — THE PITT NEWS - Monday. February 26. 1968

Upon learning that John Langstaff may soon be leaving the Uni-
versity, one might draw the hasty conclusion that a major step has been
taken in the rightxdirection. As The Pitt News stated one ye-ar ago, the

University placed itself in a vulnerable position by allowing Langstaff
to serve as director of Auxiliary Enterprises, where he is reponsible for

P Book Center policy and also owns Your C-ampus Store. For by owning Your '

Campus Store, Langstaff was competing in a sense with his employer, the
University, as both the Book Center and Your Campus Store carry some
similar items, such as mugs and glassware bearing the University seal.

‘What arose out of the conflict of interest charge was a growing
awareness by the students that the Book Center does not really serve our
student body. This leads us to say that although John Longstaff may no

 longer be with the, University, the problem of achieving a students’ book

center has yet to be effectively resolved. What really matters is that stu-

. dents, got a Watered-down discount this term when they were led to be-
. lieve that they wouldireceive a ten per cent discount on all textbooks start-'

ing last September. What really matters is that our Book Center continues
to cater to the community at the expense of serving our students. iWe
can accept the value of a Fine Arts"Room or a Book Center that features
displays of children’s books, but this is our Book Center and it offers full

. discounts to our faculty and staff, while giving us a mere token.

. , ‘We have now learned that there is a real possibility that even the '
ten per cent discount we now receive on ‘hard-back textbooks may be taken

 

Editorial: The Path to Futility?

from us. We cannot emphasize strongly enough how disastrous it would
be to take one concrete gain we students have made away from us. If we
are going to be constantly thwarted, then why should we even bother
trying? When students work with faculty and administrators to effect a
change to benefit students, this is a rarity. We have no long list of achieve-
ments, because we cannot buck an entire system."But the Book Center is
one instance where we carefully researched and proved our case adequately
enough to have a committee of three faculty members, three administra-
tors, and ‘three students approve of a ten per cent discount to all textbooks
beginning last September.

What happened to these “best laid plans?” We were told at the
end of August that there were no provisions in the budget for such a dis-

count because the ﬁscal year had already begun and the best that could 

be done was to approve a ten per cent discount on hard-covered textbooks
beginning in January. It is amazing that the two highest-ranking admin-
istrators in ﬁnance in our University never told our committee of these
lack of provisions. We cannot help but think that we were denied a con-
crete gain we earned. We earnestly ‘hope that the half victory we won
will not also be taken away from us. .

, We students are constantly told by administrators of the value in

' working within a system. We heeded these words and spent countless hours

probing the different facets of the Book Center issue before we reached
a decision. If our efforts were in vain, then all we can wonder, what is next?
The prospects are far from encouraging. ’ . I

lpWhat is Good   r
  A Question

cnmcrznvo is like eating potato chips; it’s hard‘ to stop.
The University is like the Vietnam war: blasted from inside and
out. And the good things about the University are like Lyndon
 Jo'hnson’s abdominal scar: exhibited onlylby those who are proud
A of them.
a The things at Pitt that we should be proud of are never men-
. tioned because we’re too busy bemoaning the things we’re
‘ ashamedof. It’s “in” to gripe it’s “out” to be happy here. The
problems are all too obvious, and it is worthwhile to examine
' them for their causes. But the problems have made us forget the

University’s good qualities: the things we heard about Pitt before
we came here. With each complaint, there can be a compliment.

“Apathy” has bet-omea cliche in the last three years. The
miserable voting in the Student Government and AWS elections,
i the tiny crowds at athletic events and the weak turn-out for
activities all prove that “apathetic” is an apt description of
A, University students. But “__apathetic” will be the last word for
crowds at the Greek Week chariot races and at Greek Sing next
month. The spirit at certain football games last fall was almost
tangible. I

I , IF FINANCIAL AID could ‘be found for the Greek system, or
if the dorm houses were revamped and their restrictions liber-
alized, and if the potential of new coaches and their freshman
teams materializes, student disinterest may be only a temporary
condition. V ~

  
   
 
  
   
  
   
  
   
   
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
   
   
 
   
  
  
  
 
  

Student Government ineptneiss, a result of administrative
and student disinterest, was brought to a pointed head‘ a month
. ago. Near-abolition may be the spur that SG needs. The new
officers and senators may be scared into effectiveness, or they

a er’s narrow victory over Armand Belly present him with the
greatest challenge a new president has ever had: to prove SG is
. worth his victory. The’ challenge will force Scheuler into effec-
tiveness.

, Scheuler appears to have the potential to use his power and
meet the challenge. He does not dare face the students next year
with no cause to prove Belly wrong.

PANTHERS in football cleats, basketball sneakers, track
shoes or anything else have been a national joke. But next year,
; of the eight fall and winter sports, six will have newer, younger,
‘ better coaches than they did four years ago. This year’s fresh-
men are fantastic. ’ The recruiters who lured them will still be
_ around. Next year’s freshmen will be greeted by a more than
- adequate sporting complex in the improved field house, Trees
Hall and pool.

while retaining top competition from traditional big rivals. And,

« fall's home schedule. He saw five of the very top grid teams
in the country for the price of an uphill walk (down which we
could later stagger) and one student identification card (which
 no longer included the embarassing photograph).

The extracurricular situation has nowhere to go but up, and

of Non-Recognition

’ . by Dan Lichtenstein

THE LEGISLATIVE IDIOCY retarding University appropri-
ations is inexcusable. But blame the politicians of the State of
Pennsylvania, not the University of Pittsburgh. At least now
we have some money; we didn’t two years ago.

From somewhere, the University dug up the funds for a

a _magnificent new library. The Student Union no longer looks like

an abandoned hotel for the aged; there is something to do there
now besides watching the non-fraternity “men make out with
their dates. The new indoor track to be laid‘ this summer will be
expensive; and it will be one of the best around. i

Two years ago, the Homecoming concert was held in a dis-
tant night club and featured entertainment whose names were
equally disrtantfrom any fame. Last year’s Dick Gregory and
Simon and Garfunkle provided excellent entertainment. Mitch
Ryder and the Yardbirds are nationally known groups no matter
what they actually sounded like. And Greek Week promises a

group to rival the sensational Temptations of a year ago. We’ll »

never see the Beatles, but neither will any other University.

TUITION will probably rise, but that is not the fault of the
University. And it appears we are finally getting what we paid
for. No one realizes this fact because we are blinded by con-
tinuous battles over our money; we don’t recognize what this
money is doing. The same is true about all the above improve-
ments. We do not recognize the indications of a better future
because we’re too busy griping about the past. We let the mud
of our problems bury our improvements and optimism.

WE DO NOT give enough credit to the academic area of the
University any more than to the activity and financial areas.
There is the universal complaint about the professors, their grad-
ing and the size of their classes. Well, the University is not
Ivy League, and don’t think that the same gripes are not heard
at every other school that isn’t. The Ivy Leaguers themselves
don’t have better men than Pollack, Cottam, Laufe, Crow, Ruben-
stein. Dr. Timothy Leary was at Harvard before he decided to
take trips elsewhere. Try convincing a fellow like him that you
need a grade because you flunked ROTC.

The University gives a student plenty of time to flunk out.
And at least we don’t have any of‘ those oddballs who decide
to give one class all A's and another all F’s because he doesn't
like grades. Nor are we faced with trying’to.pry an education
from political activists like San Jose State's Harry Edwards.

The professors themselves hate the growing classes. But
every University faces the same problems. Penn State has mam-
moth lecture halls where the students get to know the pro-
fessors only as a voice and pair of hands on a closed circuit TV.
They ask questions through microphones while surrounded by
other students who are knitting sweaters or playing cards_ At
least in Clapp Hall, you're close enough to the professor to ask
him to change the channel. -

STUDENT RECORDS was horrible. People griped long enough
30 that 3 few imDI‘0Vem€DtS appeared. We don’t have to fill out
those obnoxious IBM cards a hundred times just for a simple,
early schedule change. Gripe some more, and more ilnprove-
meats will follow.

Things are beginning to happen. We can’t complain any
more about an antiquated library or the lack of athletic recruit-
ers. Some improvements are gradual, so no one notices them,
The problems are undeniable; some are unique to the Uni-
versity, others are inherent in all large institutions. But an the

Letters
to the
Editor

Editor, The Pitt News:

I would like to reply to Miss Kap-
1an’s letter in The Pitt News of Feb. 21.
It seems to me that Miss Kaplan’s only
actual complaint is that of the social life,
especially ‘considering the school that
she transferred to.

I spent my ﬁrst two years at the
J ohnstown campus. and I have no corn-
plaints academically. In fact it was bet-
ter in some ways because it was possible
to ‘actually get to know the professors
unlike the imp-ersonal atmosphere here
at the Oakland campus. I received an
excellent base in my major there, better

than of many of my fellow students.

here. I have few complaints about the
over-all caliber -of my teachers there.
True, there were a few poor ones, but
t-here were also some who were quite ex-
cellent. (I noticed that Miss Kaplan had
only one concrete complaint about one
teacher.) I could say the same about my
teachers here. They’ve had varying qual-
ities in their abilities and intellect.
Admittedly the social life is isolated
in a town 65 miles from here and about
the only social life at all is from the
sororities and fraternities there. For that
reason I was very gald to get down to
the Oakland campus. But there was a
closeness there. You knew everyone and
there was a kind of waI'mt,h there. Some—
times I look back with nostalgia to
Johnstown and I have gone back there
toivisit. But I'm sure that Miss Kaplan’s
troubles are over now. As for myself,
I'm glad that I went to Johnstown ﬁrst.

TIM TRAX, varsity 160-pounder, maintains control of Penn

this bout, 11-8, only two other matmen were able to win de-
cisions. Three others lost their matches by one point, leav-
ing coach Dave Adams irked at his team’s lack of desire.

Lack of Aggressweness Irritates Adams

As Penn State  Whips

by ROY JACOBS _

Penn State wasn’t nearly
an aggressive a wrestling
team as varsity coach Dave
expected, but his own matmen
weren’t as aggressive as he
hoped that they would be. The re-
sult Saturday was a 23-9 vic-
tory for the Lions in a meet
decided by three onepoint vic-
tories.

“I was surprised at their lack
of aggressiveness,” said Adams
afterwards about Penn State,
“especially for an eighth rank-
ed team nationally. They should
have been tearing into us.

“We were deﬁnitely not ag-
gressive enough,” he continued.
“Just that much more desire
would have won the meet.” The
space between his thumb and
foreﬁnger was about a quarter-
inch.

The three key decisions came
early in the match. Bruce Un-
angst had given the varsity a
3-0 lead with a victory in the
123 pound match. Then Dick
Shildt (130), Larry Cuba (145).
and Jim Rhone (152) lost deci-
sions by 6-5, '4-3, and 3-2, respec-
tively.

These three losses, coupled
with Ron S-chuchert’s absence at
137 with a concussion, ju.st
about cancelled the varsity’-s
chances for a victory. Tim Trax
and Terry Hoover provided the
only other varsity points.

“Shildt wrestled a good match,”
reviewed Adams, “but a little
extra effort in a couple spots
could have won it for him."

Clarion Tops

As one spectator at Clarion
Friday night put it, “When you
wrestle nine weight classes, you
have to put nine men on the
m-at.” Physically, the freshmen
wrestler competed with nine
men, but their overall lack of
balance cost them a 20-13 loss
to Clarion, their ﬁrst of the sea-
son.

Mark Payne, Bob Kuhn, and
Ralph Cindrich all remained un-
defeated as each registered win-
ning decisions. Jack Hopkins,
also undefeated, was saddled
with a tie at 137 as was Gene
Reese at 16?. Previously unde-
feated Pat Lavery at 152 suffer-
ed his ﬁrst loss, 6-1.

“The whole team was down
for several possible reasons,”
analyzed Fehrs. “One, they were
up so much the week before 301‘

 

Wrestlers, 23 -9

Terry Hoover seeks right pinning combination on State rival.

Dick was wrestling Wally
Clark, who represents one of the
leading contenders for the 130
pound Eastern crown. Shildt
took Clark down with just about
two minutes to go in the match
to take a 5-3 lead.

Clark escaped to make the
score 5-4 with 1:43 to go. Since
he had two points for riding
time, all Clark had to do was
stall and avoid a takedown. He
was warned for stalling once
but wasn't penalized. The two
points for riding time gave him
the decision. '

In the locker room afterwards,
Adams seemed fairly upset with
his team’s effort. The only wres-
ler he singled out for praise was
Hoover, who completely domin-
ated Larry I-Ioltackers of State,
10-0, and almost got a fall.

Frosh; 20 - 13

Lehigh. Two, we had a new 123
pounder that hadn't been prac-
ticing. His being pinned hurt us.
And, possibly their home crowd
affected us. They got off to an
8-0 lead—which happened to our
boys before, but then Hopkins

' was tied. That had a real detri-

mental effect."

Fehrs was probably happiest
with Cindrich’s performance in
the heavyweight bout. Cindrich
won a 9-1 decision.

“Ralph got a quick takedown
and put their guy on his back,”
reviewed Fehrs. “After that ﬁve
points, he controlled the match,
but he wasn’t shooting for the
fall.

“I think if we had won the two
draws,” he continued, “Ralph
might have pinned the kid.”

Anchorman Richey
Runs 4:O4.9 Mile

by DAVE TIERNAN

Look at the freshman track team. 
at their records. Paint them consistent.

By winning the two-mile medeley relay
in the Delware Invitatio-nal meet Saturday, the
frosh added another record to the long list of stan-
dards they have established this year.

Rudy Hufnagl, frosh 600 yard run record-
holder, opened the race with a 1:55.? time in the
half mile." He passed the baton and the lead to
Wally Swigerer, who responded with a :50.2 in the
440, holding Pitt’s edge.

Smooth Smitty Brown relieved Swiger and ran
his quarter in :50.2, which was off his frosh 440
record of :49.9. But Brown maintained the lead.
and gave the baton to anchorman Jerry Richey.

Richey, who holds three school records, follow-
pre-race plans in his mile, and finished with a
4:04.9 time. The relay team beat second-place
William and Mary by 12 seconds, and their time of
7:40.9 is another frosh record.

Coach Jim Banner, who was pleased with the
relay team’s effort, explained the pre-race strategy.
“If Richey had the lead,’’ noted‘Ban.ner, “he was
to go all out in the first three fourths of his mile.
and tire out the other runners. As it turned out,
he ran his fastest mile ever.”

I Five fourths and a fifth place finish was the

_best the varsity thinclads could manager against
the 13-team field. Roger Holly and Bob.McElheny ’

led the varsity with strong performances.

Holly won his trial heat in the 600 yard run,
but his time of 1:1'2.8 in the ﬁnals was only good
enough for fourth place.'According to Banner, the
ﬁeld in the 600 was the thoughest in the meet.

McElheny finished fourth in the triple jump,
but his 44 foot jump was his first in two years.
The triple jump isn’t included in indoor dual meets,
and “Mac” had been broad jumping this year
instead.

‘In other fourth-place finishes, Chet Woiliechow.
ski ran the 60 yard dash in 6.5 seconds; Tom
Christie cleared the 60 yard high hurdles in 7.7
seconds; and Ken Lawton finished fourth in the
two-mile run. skip Orsulak placed fifth in the
broad jump.

Swim Team Falls To Kent State

For Ninth Loss In Season Finale

by ART ROSENGARTEN

When the waters of Trees
Pool ﬁnally settled into a
mirror-like stillness Satur-
day night, the swim team under
its ﬁrst year of Bill Grant’s tu-til-
age had closed its season with
their ninth loss. The victors
were the Golden Flashes of
Kent State by a score of 67-46.

“It’s all over now,” -said Grant
looking out on the still waters.
“We may have only won three
meets, but at least we haven't
lost our sense of humor.” This
was clearly evident as Grant
continually joked and fooled
around with the swimmers be-
fore and after their races, in an
effort to keep the boys loose.

The meet started oﬁ and end-

ed with two close and exciting
races. Before the largest crowd
of the season, comprised mostly
of Kent fans, the two squads
raced to a neck and neck ﬁnish
in the 400-yard medley relay.
The Staters just nip-ped the
team of Rich Norris, Chris
Price, Howard Norris, and John
Lane by 1.2 seconds.

Price returned later to duel
Kent’s Greg Lampe in the 200-

yard breaststroke. With mem-
bers of both squads waving tow-
els, whistling, and yelling en-
couragement to their swimmers,
both Price and Lampe swam the
200 yards almost stroke for
stroke, with neither being able
to take any sort of load.‘ The

 

TITREE VARSITY swimmers (left to right), John Lane, Chris
price, and Dean Coleman, competed in their last dual swimming
meet, losing to Kent State Saturday. Each ‘won his specialty, but
‘ the team lost, 67-46.

race ended with Price touching
the wall a fraction ahead of
La.mpe’s outstretched hands
and three-tenths off the Pitt rec-
ord.

The diving competition brought
satisfaction to one diver and ‘a
record to another. Dean Cole-
man captured the low board
title with 181.35 points. The
score ‘fell short of his goal of
200 points, but Coleman was
satisﬁed by ending his diving
career with a win and a good
performance.

The record went to Kent's
Mark Horowitz. Horowitz, _a div-
er under Grant in high school,

came back to show his old mas-

ter just what he had learned. .

Horowitz broke the mark set
by Indiana State's. Mike Bam-
hill last week with a score of
220.10 points.

Lane ﬁnished his regular sea-
son competition with victories in
the 100 and 200-yard freestyle.
Howard Norris also had a line
night by capturing the 200-yard
butterﬂy and, with only two
events rest, came back to notch

second place in the 500-yard free- 

style. Teammate Gene Hoffman
classiﬁed the two boys as “be-

‘ ing the guttsiest swimmers on .
the teamq’-.-.~. M  -

Shidemantle Wins, But
Gymnasts Lose Again

Fraternities
Wrestle-Off

Tomorrow

by ED CONLEY

Sigma Chi of League “A”
and Theta Chi of League
“B” will lead their sections in
the fraternity wrestle-off tomor-
row at 7 p.m. in Trees Hall.

Sig Chi captured the “A”
League title last week with
three champions and a 70-61 win
over the nearest competition,
Delta Sigma Phi. Third place
was held by Delta Tau Delta
(41% points).

In “B,” Theta Chi will take
ﬁve men into the match, hav-
ing had an easy time in their
league competition, scoring a
victory by a 23-point margin.
Theta Chi’s 60 points were well
ahead of second place Sigma Al-
pha Epsilon’s 37 points and Pi
Kappa Alpha’s 31 points.

Mike Duffy will start things

off for Theta Chi in the 120-
pound class, dueling the “A”
lightweight king, Bob Hillerson
of Zeta Beta Tau. Duffy pinned
teammate Dave Koch in 3:59 to
grab the “B" spot, while Hiller-
son took a 6-3 decision from Bob
Chellel of Sigma Chi for the
“A” title.
_ Bob Wingard holds down the
130-pound position for the “B”
champs. He will battle Bill
Schaaf of the Delts in the
wrestle-off.

Howard Buchanan, also of
Theta Chi, leads his league into
the 140-pound class. Ian Bagu-
ley of Delta Sig will go against
Buchanan in what promises to
«be one of the best matches of
the night. Baguley grabbed a
tight decision from Jim LeDonne
of the Delts, 3-2, last week, put-
ting him in this match.

The Theta Chi dominance is
broken up in the 150-pound class
as Frank Diettinger of Phi Gam-
ma. Delta will face Steve Line-
baugh of the Delts. Sigma Chi’s
Pete Jakobson and Tom Stickle
were named eo-champions in the
“A” 160-pound weight grouping.
Jakobson will do the wrestling
tomorrow night and will meet
Theta Chi’s Karl Smith.

In the 170-pound bracket, Bill
Sn-ee of the Fijis will wrestle
Rich DeForno of Phi Epsilon
Pi. Randy Dry, the ﬁnal Theta
Chi reipresentative, will be pit-
ted against Jim Wampler of Sig-
ma Ch-i in the 180-pound class.

Another Sigma Chi leader,
Bob White, will be the “A”
threat in the 190-pound group,
going against Steve Demase of
SAE. White rolled through the
tourney with wiriis of 5-2 an-d
5-0 last week, while Demase pin-
ned Tom Cerchiary at 1:57.

Heavyweights George Rich-
ards of Delta Sig and Bennett
Bruckner of P'iKa will duel in
the ﬁnal match-of the wrestle-
off.

Penn State added. a sour
note to Dave Shidemantle’s
swan song Saturday by handing
the’ gymnasts a 171.65-107.65 lo-ss
in the season ﬁnale. The gym
team ﬁniisihed at 1-10.

Shidemantle, competing in his
last ‘regular-season collegiate
meet, got in shape for the Fri-
day and Saturday EIGL cham-
pionships at Navy by grabbing
ﬁrsts iin ﬂoor exercise with an
8.95 and on the longhorse with
a 9.45.

“I'm just going with floor ex
and vaulting in the Easterns,”
Shidemantle said. “You usually
need at least a 9.0 to make the
ﬁnals, and I think I can do it.”

Penn State, using its reserve
team, dominated the rest oflthe
meet. Joe Litow. Marty De San-
tis, and Don Spiker combined
for wins in five events.

Litow took the sidehorse with
an 8.6 and also won on the still

 

rings with an 8.95. De Santis
paced the trampoline event with
an 8.6, and Spiker won the par-
allel and high bar events with
scores of 8.70 and 7.90.

Penn State coach Gene Wetts-
stone was so conﬁdent in scor-
ing his seventh straight win that
he left all-around man Bob Em-
ery, tramp star Tom Clark, high
bar specialist Dick Siwetman,
and ring star Paul Vexler home
to rest for the Easterns.

Bob Dodson and Tom Fisher
also concluded their careens S-at-
urday. Fisher bowed out with a
7.90 on the still rings and Dod-
son scored a second-place 8.35
on parallel bars. Neiger is still
undecided on taking Dodson
allong with Shidemantle to the
Easterns.

“I will look over Dodson’s
scores this season and then talk
to him before Wednesday about
it,” said Neiger.

THE SEARCH CONTINUES

Last week’s appointment of Johnny Bach to the head
basketball job at Penn State ended the speculation for those
who like to think that Mt. Nittany is equal to Mt. Olympus.

Penn State offered Bach the job almost as soon as John
Egli announced he was resigning. The Lion Athletic Depart-
ment wanted Bach. It was only a question of whether Bach
would leave Fordham after 18 years to live in State College

Pitt, on the other hand, has no one replacement in mind
for Bob Timmons.

Carver has revealed that he has received approximate-
ly 25 applications “from as far away as California.” Some of
the names surprised me,” Carver added, hinting that several

well-established coaches have applied. “But there others

I’ve never heard of,” he conﬁnded. “I’ll have to rely on rec-
ommendations and the interviews for those.”

While Carver has refused to disclose the names of those
under consideration, at least three are known. Pitt fresh-
man coach Tim Grgurich, Duke assistant coach Tom Car-
mody, and Davidson assistant coach Jerry Conboy.

Rumors are abundant that Bobby Knight, the highly
successful Army coach, is dissatisﬁed with the program
there and would like another head coaching job. He report-
edly wanted the Penn State position and has now applied
for the opening here.

If the rumors .are true, Knight should be the logical
choice. He’s in his late twenties, has been head coach at
Army for three years and his present squad was invited to
both the NCAA and NIT tournaments.

Word is also circulating around that Grgurich is not
one of Carver’s favorites and that Tim is making plans for
employment elsewhere next year. However, even if there is
no clash between Carver and the opinionated Grgurich, his
qualiﬁcations hardly make him head coaching material.

Grgurich has been an eager recruiter when compared
to Timmons, but he has yet to land an outstanding ballplay—
er. Only four years out of college, Grgurich has only had
three years of coaching experience and while his teams have
compiled winning records, they have consistently beaten
the Point Parks, Carnegie—Mellons, and Johnstowns, but not
the Duquesnes or West Virginias.

Carmody and Conboy, on the other hand, have coached
at high schools in the Pittsburgh area. Carmody recruits for
Duke in Western Pennsylvania and last year he landed Dick
DiVenzio and Steve Litz for the Blue Devils. Carmody’s
qualiﬁcations are impressive. He’s been with a Winner as has
Conbody. Both are currently recruiting for their schools.

Pitt must name its coach soon before all the talent in
Pennsvlvania is committed elsewhere.

Last Home Game for Egli

  

Penn State Downs Cagers  

by MIKE BROURMAN

Penn State did on Satur-
day what the Panthers
couldn’t do last week. They
won the last home game of re-
tiring coach John Egli. And, the
cagers were the victims of that
sentimental occasion, 77-68, at
University Park.

Like Bob Timmons, Egli is
quitting to take on other re-
sponsibilities, but unlike the in-
spired game the Panthers play-
ed against West Virginia, the
Nittany Lions were quite or-
dinary in their performance.

They had already beaten the
cagers, 66-43, .at the Field House,
and actually had a harder time
in their home gym. This is un-
usual in itself, for in the past
the Panthers have always had
a terrible time up there. Last
year they lost, 88-44.

But, Saturday Penn State play-
ed asloppy, unorganized game.
Unfortunately, the P an t h e r s
were just as sloppy, and went
down to their 15th defeat in 21
games.

The Nittany Lions never trail-
ed, but they were never able to
pull away. They jumped off to
a 38-28 halftime lead, mainly on
the strength of drives by guard
Jeff Persson, but were unable
to increase ‘that margin i.n the
second period.

To combat Persson, Timmlons
switched the Panthers from a
man-to-man to a zone defense in
the second half. That choked off
his drives, but set up the other
Nittany Lions for easy buckets.
The Panthers were also hurt by
a fast break.

Tony DeLisio, who has been
the most consistent scorer for
the cagers in recent weeks, led

the boards, picking off six re-
bounds. Mike Patcher gnabbed
nine, as overall the Panthers
outrebounded Penn State, 51-46.

Persson led the Nittany Lions
with 18 points, while three other
starters hit double ﬁgures. Bill
Young and Tom Daley each had
15, while Bill Stanﬁeld scored 12.

The Panthers ﬁnish out the
season Wednesday when they
meet Carnegie-Mellon at Skibo
Gym. It will be the ﬁnal game,
not only for Timmons, but ﬁor

the two seniors on the squad, -

co-captains Ken Bollens and Pete
Smith. The cagers s-wamlped -the
Tartans in the ﬁrst game, but
there was no sentiment involved
in that one. And sentiment has
not been kind to the cagers
lately.
