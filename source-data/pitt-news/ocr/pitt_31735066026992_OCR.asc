Here's cl story of cl man named...

Groovy
Greg

goes to
college

By John B. Moore
Asst. News Editor

With his Johnny Bravo cos-
tume tucked safely away next to
his Hawaiian tiki, somewhere in
Mike’s converted study, the old-
est Brady went to college last
night.

Barry Williams, aka Greg
Brady, lectured to a sold out
crowd last night in the William
Pitt Union Assembly Room.

“I’m sony if I was late,” began
Williams. “I was fixing my
bike.”

W"1lliam’s walked the audience
through a two—hour retrospective
of life on Clinton Lane, stopping
at times to dish out Brady dirt,
narrate classic ﬁlm clips, model
the ‘60s uniform and even
demonstrate Brady choreogra-

phy- _
Greg and Barry are two differ-
ent people according to

Williams. “Greg was a confused
teenager trying to get dates all
the time, he was trying to ﬁgure
out what to do with his life.
Barry Wrlﬂiarns is a sophisticat-
ed adult trying to get dates and
ﬁgure out what to do with his
life. Some things never change.”

Including various versions of
the TV show, reunions and even
an attempt at a variety show a la
Donnie and Marie, the Bradys
have been on television for four
consecutive decades, on three
networks and through six presi-
dents.

“You too can have a family
exactly like the Bradys, all you
need are the same things that the

night in the WPU.

Pitt students can't forget Brody

By Christine Hanna
Editor in Chief

Jessica Ullery, a former Pitt
graduate student, thought she
was going to a literature lec-
ture last night with a good
friend. ‘

But when she walked into
the William Pitt Union
Assembly Room and saw the
stacks of books written by
“Greg Brady,” Barry
Williams, she was excited. “I
had no idea,” she said. “I can’t
believe it’s Barry Williams!”

A good friend knew she
liked TV and the Brady Bunch
a lot, so he decided to surprise
her. “I’ve already read his
book,” she said.

Fans packed the room, wait-
ing to hear Williams spill all
of the Brady secrets.

Pitt junior Maureen
O’Halloran, clad in a Greg
Brady T-shirt, thought a
moment before sharing her

favorite Brady Bunch episode.
It only took her a few seconds.

“When Greg got his own
room  and totally ‘70s—cized
it with beads and lava lamps,”
she said.

She continued to rapidly
explain the episode. It was the
one where Greg just entered
high school and felt he needed
his independence so he moved
out of Peter and Bobby’s room
and into his father’s den.

He was hitting on some girl
at school and then decided he
was too old to go on the fami-
ly camping trip. But then the
girl rejected him and he decid-
ed the family was more
important, she said.

“I am a 14-year fan of
Greg,” O’Halloran said.

Freshman Steve Czeck said
Greg would also have to be
his favorite Brady. “I like the
‘Johnny Bravo’ episode,” he
said.

Czeck said he has seen all of

the episodes, read Williams’
book and has the CD. “It’s my
favorite TV show of all time.”

Andrew Soltesz, a third-year
student, disagreed and said
Marcia is his favorite.
“Marcia’s so perfect and bean-
tiful  I loved when she wore
those short plaid skirts and
tight sweaters and had long
straight hair.”

Soltesz said his favorite
episode is the “Silver Platters”
one when the Brady kids
went to amateur night to win
money to pay for the engrav-
ing on a silver platter for
their parents. “They did the
best routine for the welfare of
their parents’ anniversary,” he
said.

Other favorites were Marcia
getting hit in the nose with a
football, the whole bunch
going to Hawaii and Peter’s
famous “pork chops and
applesauce” Humphrey

Pitt to hire vice provost for women '5 concerns

By Jennifer McGinnis
Staiﬂr

Women faculty and staff members at Pitt
gathered yesterday morning to debate the
job description of the proposed position of
vice provost for women’s concerns.

Jack Daniel, the vice provost for acade-
mic affairs, led an open forum yesterday to
discuss the new position in the provost’s
oﬂice.

“For two years, the Senior Women’s
Group and the provost’s and chance11or’s
offices have been planning a singular posi-
tion to advocate and implement things rela-
tive to women at the university,” said
Daniel.

The vice provost for women’s concerns

will be a senior administrative position
involving the recruitment, retention and
development of women within the univer-
sity. The new vice provost would serve for
three to ﬁve years and would report direct-
ly to the provost, Jim Maher.

Along with the responsibility of voicing
the concerns of women faculty, staff and
students, the new vice provost will be
involved in administrative activities in the
provost’s ofﬁce.

These responsibilities will include the
review of tenure and promotion applica-
tions, budget issues and special projects,
the provost’s office said. The new vice
provost is also expected to work directly
with the Provost’s Advisory Committee for
Women’s Concerns.

Many women at the forum expressed
concerns about the authority the new vice
provost would have. Questions were raised
about whether or not the vice provost
would merely have an advocacy role, or
whether speciﬁc responsibilities and deci-
sion making would be a part of the job.

The provost’s office is currently deﬁning
the vice provost’s job description and is
thinking of putting the Board of Visitors
under his/her jurisdiction, Daniel said.

Women staff members asked if the cre-
ation of this position was simply a politi-
cally correct thing to do or if the vice
provost would actually have any clout and
suﬂicient resources to act with.

Daniel’s response was that he felt it was

Bogart impersonation.

Peter was also another
Brady favorite.

“I liked Peter,” said fresh-
man Nicole Federico. “Peter
was just really cute.”

Freshman Lori Marzullo

agreed. “He’s cute and funny.
He’s the middle child and I
relate to him.”

Alice was a favorite of
senior Jason Wagner. “She
always solved all of their
problems and she was cool 
Sam too.”

Forum

necessary for specific duties to
be assigned to the position. “If
that person is [only] an advo-
cate, that person will have
essentially no authority and
will not be effective,” he said.

Concerns were also
expressed about the search for
the vice provost being done
internally. A member of the
Provost’s Search Committee
said that the chancellor always
urges committees to look for
women and minorities, but the
people usually selected are
non-minority and male.

Daniel agreed with this con-
cern and related similar con-
cerns he had with the selection

of _ the vice provost for
research. “When I. heard that
would be an internal search, I
said, ‘There will be no woman
in that position,”’ Daniel said.
The fact that there is a term
limit for the position was ques-
tioned.'Staff members won-
dered if this position was going
to be on a “trial basis” and if it

I is likely to be cut after the ﬁrst

term is up. A trend of women
being the first to be cut’ when

downsizing occurs was also

mentioned.

The comments from the
forum will be given to the full
search committee, and the
position is expected to be filled
by May 1, 1995.

Bradys had,” said Williams. “A
producer, a director, a writer, a
big camera, a really bad
wardrobe and astroturf in the
backyar .”

Set in the 1960s, the Brady
Bunch took place in the era of
the Vietnam war, hippies, the
opening of relations with China
and an escalating divorce rate.
The creator of the series,
Sherwood Schwartz, wanted to
create a show with a blended
family.

“His original idea was to have
a widower, that would be Mike,
with three sons, and a divorcee
with three daughters.” said
Williams. “And when he took
that idea to the network they said
‘No no, you can’t have a
divorce’ on television, it’s not
funny.”

Agreeing with the network,
Schwartz said okay, but never
did change the concept in his
mind. He also refused to change
the name from the “The Brady
Bunch,” to “The Brady Breud.”

‘They felt that the word bunch

was just too controversial for the
air waves,” explained Williams.
“Because at that time bunch was
associated with lawlessness,
street gangs and movies like
“The Wild Bunch.”’

Getting to the topic of inter-
Brady dating, Greg detailed his
one and only date with TV mom
Florence Henderson that ended
with a goodnight kiss.

In search of a normal outlet,
Williams said he stopped dating

his TV mom and started dating I

his TV sister. Detailing the first
time he set eyes onMarcia,
(Maureen , McCormick.)
“Marcia, Marcia, Marcia. I’m
telling you even then she was a
babe. She was only 12 but fortu-
nately the show lasted ﬁve long
years and patience paid off.”

It was on the beach, filming
the infamous Hawaii episode,
that Williams and McCormick
kissed for the first time. ‘There
was a full moon you could see it
reﬂecting across the water. There
was a warm breeze... and then
there" was Marcia,” Williams
said, detailing the prelude to his

kiss. “We were enjoying the kiss, ,

each other and the night. And
that’s as far as it went.”

“Ever?” questioned an audi-
encemember.

“That night,” replied Wilhatns.

Williams went on to describe
the attempted cartoon version of
the Bradys, as well as series spin-
offs “The Brady Hour,” “The
Brady Brides,” and one-hour TV
movies, “The Brady Girls Get
Married,” and “A Very Brady
Christmas,” among others. I

After showing a series of clas-
sic Brady clips, Williams
emerged from behind the projec-
tion screen clad in plaid bell bot-
toms, a suede fringed vest, a
headband and shades. He then
attempted to lead more than 50
Pitt students through Brady

choreography, in step with “It’s a

Sunshine Day.”

And as the oldest Brady packs
up the show and heads onto
another college, Brady fans alike
can stay content with the knowl-
edge that The Brady clan lives on
in reruns and possibly a few
more reunions.

Opinions

Don't cut subsidies

Get ready to be a little more perturbed as you wait in line at
Thackeray Hall to sign a loan, or worse, begin to pay back a
loan. ,

USA Today reported that the House Budget Committee, head-
ed by Republican John Kasich from Ohio, “listed elimination of
the student subsidy” in Stafford Loans as a “way to help balance
the budget.”

Basically, Congress is saying they are going to cut the subsidy
out of the loan, making the student pay even more, just to help
plug a deﬁcit it created in the first place.

The subsidized Stafford Loan means that when a student gets
a federal loan, the government pays the cost of the interest while
the student remains in school. The student then pays back the
loan six months after leaving school.

The American Council on Education estimates that undergrad-
uate students taking out the maximum amount allowable —
$17,125 over four years — would see their total repayment cost
rise 20 percent, or about $3,400.

_ The fact that the feds are messing with the Stafford Loan is
even more upsetting because that particular loan is usually easi-

' er to get. It is not given on a strictneed basis, paving the way for

some people in the “my parents make too much for me to get
financial aid but not enough for me to afford school” category to
can get this loan.

If the federal government wants to make balancing the budget
a priority, that’s fine, but they shouldn’t try to fix their mistakes
at our expense.

Concern for women?

The chancellor’s office and the provost’s office have
announced that, after two years of planning, they are ready to
hire a vice provost for women’s concerns.

That’s right — two years of planning and discussing. .

It took two of the most powerful offices in the school tw
years to come to the decision that we need someone in charge of

-1 women’s concerns. Congress makes decisions faster than that.
 Beyond that, this ‘position is only supposed to las-t for three to

five years. Are we supposed to believe that after three to five
years, women will no longer have any concerns at Pitt?

Maybe the administration at Pitt wants to have this position
because it is politically correct, or maybe it is a real concern for
the administration to bring women’s issues to thejforefront.
Either way, it should not have taken two years to figure it out,
and in addition, the whole position becomes a waste if a term
limit is placed.

So, Pitt administrators have finally decided that the position I

will be filled. Only now they have to decide who is going to fill
it, a male or a female. As long as the individual is qualified, it
shouldn’t matter what their gender is. Hopefully, it won’t take
two years to decide this time.

ﬂashing lights than the inside of
Epilectic Seizures ‘R’ Us —
simply awful. Howard Roark
would have blown it up on gen-
eral principle.

3. Whenever possible, carry

your bags onto the plane.
People in the seats around you
will grumble. Your legs will be
cramped. But when it turns out
that USAir thought it would be a
good idea to leave everyone’s
luggage two cities back, it will
be you who has the last laugh. I
learned this the hard way after
spending three hours watching
other peoples’ bags go around
the luggage carousel. And
around. And around.

3a. If you DO check your
bags, make sure you don’t
leave your keys in them. Um
 not that I would ever do any-
thing this silly, uh, I just hap-
pened to think of this for
absolutely no reason at all.

4. Passenger 57 was a bad
movie. Wesley Snipes is a
decent actor (though of course
when you pair him with Sean
Connery it becomes obvious that
— well, never mind, I digress).
But the script — I can just imag-
ine how the first conversation
between the producer and the

’ writer went:

PRODUCER: So, what have
you got?

WRITER: It’s a brilliant ﬁlm,
baby, brilliant!

PRODUCER: What’s it like?

WRITER: It’s like every
cliché ever used in the history of
action movies, in just one film!

PRODUCER: What, there’s
nothing new in it? '

WRITER: Right! No risks!

PRODUCER: I love it!

5. Always, always ﬂush the
toilet. This one is for those so-
called “men” who somehow
manage to forget something that
they learned at age three. You
wouldn’t think this could happen
very much, would you? Yet
those of us living in dorrrrs are
forced to deal with the conse-
quences almost every day. If
you’re a perpetrator, know that
those who live around you con-
sider you slightly less human
than mold.

6. New Jersey is not a big,
overcrowded, polluted mess.
Well, OK, maybe North Jersey
is. But South Jersey has trees

and farms and Bruce Springsteen
and stuff. Heck, in my home-
town we. even have a bobcat.

7. Get enough sleep. The
great Warren Zevon would scoff
at this one. “I’ll sleep when I’m
dead,” goes his lyric, and he’s
right — you can stay awake for
days at a time. But you’ll be
dead a whole lot quicker if you
do.

8. Life is like a box of choco-
lates. All right, who’s the smart-
aleck who let that get in here?

9. Polygamy is underrated.
Group marriages are exactly
what this country needs to get
itself out of its current moral cri-
sis. A family with, say, three
husbands and two wives would
guarantee that there would
always be someone around to
take proper care of the kids. If
one parent wanted a divorce,
there would still be four left to
keep little Billy from flunking
out of school and joining a street
gang. And tell the truth, female
readers — wouldn’t it be great to
make three men do the dishes
instead of just one?

10. Think. All of these great
tidbits are just my humble opin-
ions. If you want to reject them
out of hand, well, that’s your
prerogative, please close the
door on your way out. Then
again, if you want to just blindly
accept them — well, actually I’d
rather like that,_ maybe we could
hang out sometime.

But what you really should do
is reason for yourself. GO to
New Jersey and see if I’m telling
the truth by watching Passenger
57 with the bobcat and make up
your own mind as to whether or
not it deserves to be laughed at.
FIND a bunch of people you like
and marry them all. (Not in
Pennsylvania, though, the men
in black suits will come to take
you away.)

Agreeing with me would be
great, but give it some thought
first. After all, what do I know?

His name is Stephen H. Segal.
People call him Stephen H.
Segal.

. cially television

A quick overview of the
facts:

, °In other major sports, such
as football and basketball, the
NCAA version of the sport
continues to gain on the NBA
and NFL as far as popularity. It
has gotten to the point where
many people would prefer to
watch a college game, given
the choice between pro and

' NCAA. Do you see as much

excitement surrounding the
NBA ﬁnals as you do around
the NCAA tournament?
°Baseball may not be a sport

which is growing, but is still.
probably the most popular sport
in the United States. More chil-
dren play organized baseball
than any other sport, and TV
rights for major league regional
games, playoffs, etc. are and
always will be at a premium.

-We know the College World
Series, televised every June,
continues to draw more and
more viewers as cable and net-
work stations bid higher every
year to get the television rights.

Taking these factors into
account and then looking at
some of the sporting events I
see televised everyday, I cannot
believe college baseball
couldn’t grab a significant fol-
lowing if given the chance.

I also realize there are argu-
ments to be made against the
status of college baseball, in
light of each Major League
team possessing farm systems
where many of their big league
prospects are nurtured.

However, college baseball is
attracting a growing number of
quality baseball players, many
of whom spurned offers to go
pro in return for an education.
The long bus rides and fast
food,which are the life of a
minor leaguer, do not look so
inviting when there’s a good
chance the player may be
unemployed for a long time if
the big leagues do not pan out.

Big pinch-hit/we/ps Pitt nip Marsha//, 6-5

By Brad Isles »
Staff Writer

Talk about an unlikely
hero. With an MRI for a bum
shoulder scheduled early
yesterday afternoon, Mike
Rohrbach wasn’t even sure
he was going toplay in the
Panthers’ game against
Marshall. But for them, it’s a
good thing he did.

“Today I got my shoulder
checked out,” said Rohrbach.
“I wasn’t even going to play,
but when the doctor gave me
the OK to play, I got my uni-
form on and ran down here.”

_It was Rohrbach’s pinch-
hit liner up the middle that
drove in the winning run for
Pitt, breaking a 5-5 deadlock
in the bottom of the ninth
inning.

“I knew if it was a close
game I was going to get the
call,” Rohrbach added. “I

 was really ready for that sit-

uation.” _

The hit came on a l-0
count after Jon DeBernardis
nearly ended the game with a
home run. Instead, he dou-
bled high off the wall in left
field, setting the plate -for
Rohrbagh.  A

aggressively,” said
Rohrbach.

The 6-5 win raised Pitt’s
record to 15-2 and dropped
the Thundering Herd to 6-16.

Lead-off man, Josh Mellor's slide beats the throw in yesterday's 6-5 win at Trees Field.
Mellor was hit by a pitch four times-and walked his other at bat. ‘

all nine Marshall batters in a
row, while striking out three.

Pitt got out on top early,
capitalizing on leadoff man

..mI‘osh Mellor’:§_being hit by a
"'°"f>itich in fhegbottom half of

the first. He was driven in by
Jason Conti’s fielder’s
choice.

Mellor showed why he
leads the team in on-base
percentage (.587). He
reached base all five plate
appearances while not regis-
tering an at-bat. His first
three times up he was hit by
a pitch, the fourth time he
walked and the final time he
was hit again. This raised his

team-leading total to 10.
Marshall pitchers hit two
other batters on the day.

“I guess I’m a little lucky,”
joked Mellor about being hit.

“We""do"little things where i

we get up on the plate and
intimidate the pitcher a little
bit. That’s what I like to do,
just intimidate the pitcher to
the point that he’s thinking
about me more than throw-
ing over the plate.”

The Panthers increased‘

their lead to 4-0 in the bot-
tom of the third. Bob Miller
walked and was followed by
Mellor’s second hit-by-pitch.

later scored on a passed ball.
Tyler Shantz capped off the
inning with a blast over the
wall in left with two outs,
his first homer of the season.

Panther pitchers held the

inning, when Tim Fanning
singled off Tedde Campbell
over second base. Until_this
time, Bean, Jason Shields

for nine strikeouts, walked

West Virginia turns up heat on men's tennis

By Paul Kogut
Staff Writer

It was a nippy 40 degrees
outside the Charles L. Cost
indoor sports facility yester-
day afternoon, but Pitt’s
men’s tennis team found it to
be even less inviting inside.

The visiting West Virginia
Mountaineers turned a cold,
nay, frigid ‘shoulder to /the
Panthers (6-6) and won all six
singles matches by decisive
margins, earning them six
points.

Before the singles matches
were played, a ray of sunlight
did breakthrough on Pitt’s
side of the court: the Panthers
won two of three doubles
matches. But the victories (as
per the rules of the game)
only earned Pitt a single
point.

Final score: 6-1, advantage
West Virginia. .

“There was some tough
competition here today,”

sophomore Braden Doherty,
Pitt’s top seed, said while sit-
ting on a table shortly after
his singles match and nursing
his right knee with an ice
pack. West Virginia courts “a
deep team from seed one on
down to six.”

Doherty, wearing a “do-
rag” like tennis star Andre
Agassi used to, lost 6-4, 6-4
to West Virginia senior Mark
Nigalan, who is ranked
among the top 30 players in
the eastern division of the
NCAA — which covers about
60 teams.

Mike “Thor” Sullivan, a
junior and recent transfer
from Duquesne University,
also fell to his opponent, 6-1,
7-6. The second set was espe-
cially hard to take for
Sullivan, considering that he
had battled back from a 3-0
deficit and later led his oppo-

_ nent 6-5. But Sullivan lost his
serve at that point, and West
Virginia’s Matt Feeney used

the opportunity to turn the
tide. -

“I had him,” said a frustrat-
ed Sullivan, shrugging.

The other four Panthers, suf-
fered losses as well, some
more humiliating than others.
Brad Wade, Pitt’s second
seed, dropped his match 6-3,
6-2 to Rod Stevula. Christian
Frenza, a native of Caracas,
Venezuela, lost 6-1, 6-0 to
Steve Duffin. Matt Mills lost
7-5, 6-1 to Ben Jacobs. And
Stephen Rosenthal lost 6-3, 6-
1 to Walter Samora. ‘

“Doherty, Sullivan, Wade
and Frenza all played tremen-
dous tennis,” coach George
Dieffenbach said. “But we
need to get a little more
aggressive, a little more con-
sistent in singles play.A’h’

The doubles matches were
indeed the bright spot for the
young Panthers, who started
just one junior and no seniors.
Yet, even in doubles, they did
falter brieﬂy when Mills and

Rosenthal lost (8-3) to the
team of Jacobs and Samora.

Then Pitt’s team of Doherty
and Wade beat Nigalan and
Stevula (9-8). This victory
was quickly followed by
another (8-6) from Frenza and
Sullivan, prompting
Sullivan’s teammates and the
few spectators (who were lay-
ing on a cushion next to the
court) to begin chanting
“Thor,” Sullivan’s nickname,
as the victors walked off the
court.

“We definitely got the best
of them [in doubles action],”

said_Dieffenbach. “It was I
well-played. The doubles win ‘

was very encouraging for us.”

Dieffenbach, a 20-year vet-
eran at Pitt, is also encour-
aged by the fact that four of
his eight players are sopho-
mores, which gives the team
time to gain experience and
improve. “We’re very young,”
he said. “I feel we have a very
strong, strong future.”'

The Brady Bunch Movie
with Shelly Long and Gary
Cole

ln our own cluttered world of
body piercing, tattoos and cel-
lular phones, sometimes we
forget about good wholesome
fun. You know, like square
dancing with your family or
having a potato sack race,
(with no drugs or alcohol
involved). But we all know that
for a Brady kid, this is quality
time.

Well the, as one critic put it,
“long awaited” (and I must ask,
awaited by whom) Brady
Bunchémovie has landed in
theaters and maybe, just
maybe, we would all have
been just a little better off had
it waited a bit longer — maybe
a few years, or better yet,
never. Perhaps we should
have left this hokey stuff under
lock and key in the archives
with episodes of Gi//igan’s

elk: still

Island and The
G r e a t e s t
American Hero.
Just think of
the premise: the
‘70s bunch,
m a i n t a i n i n g
their superior
clothing and attitude, are stuck
in modern day L.A. Sound
appealing? Guess again. Sure
the flick opens with everything
those who grew up with the
family would expect, except for
an extra polyestered Mr. Brady
(I don’t remember him being
so starched and checkered.).
Every Brady kid is doing his or
her groovy thing: Cindy tattling
with Kitty Carry-All doll, Bobby
with his so adorable freckles,
Jan whining suffering from an
extreme case of schizo-like
Marsha-Marsha-Marsha/
Middle Kid Syndrome, Peter
with his fluctuating-voice fol-
lowing his uncontrollable
libido, Greg with guitar in
hand, and Marsha (who has a
scary resemblance to the real
Marsha) assessing her boy
problems with hairbrush in
hand. Mrs B. is obedient to
good ol’ Mike, and Alice is
making cookies complaining
about Meat Market Sam’s
reluctance to marry her.

Yes, everything is normal in
Bradyland (even the ever-pre-
sent chalk board by the fridge
reads “Pork chops and apple-
sauce,” reminding us of
Bobby's ‘acting’ days.) But
once these bell-bottomed spin-
sters leave their astroturf yard,
we see them enter another
world —— a world we supposed-
ly live in, a world where kids
hot-rod, where neighbors
aren’t compassionate, where
third-base in the make-out
game is no longer a hand on
the shoulder (shucks) and
where the school therapist is
none other than FluPau|.

We see the Bradys’ life in a
plastic bubble (However they
do owe $20,000 in back taxes
— how realisticll) bouncing
through the streets of L.A. set-
ting things straight and actual-
ly making people re-examine
their own lives. When a thug
stops Marsha and Greg to car-
jack them, their awkward
politeness frightens the crook
more than the police ever
could. I guess we’re supposed
to think this is cute. Greg may
be drop-dead gorgeous, but
the Bradys causing people to

 re-think anything is not.

Many of the original show’s
most popular episodes

(remember Mom always said
don’t play ball in the house
and Marsha’s swollen nose?)
get referred to, making us
remember what we once loved
or what we once wished to for-
get. These rehashed episodes
are given a raunchier tone to
satisfy those past Brady fans
who somewhere in the past 20
or so years may have gone off
the beaten path (you know,
those who would actually
enjoy seeing Alice in a skimpy,
black, Madonna-looking body-
suit with gold shimmering
pasties). Picture it without
shaking. ‘

Anyway, we all know that
Sam and Alice had something
going on, and this PG-13 ver-
sion takes us a bit further. In
one scene we see Sam in a
robe leaving A|ice’s hidden
abode in the wee hours of the
night to get a drink. when
stopped by the man of the
house who asks something
like, ‘What are you doing?” the
procrastinating butcher says,
“Just delivering some meat.”
Ha ha, pretty funny for us sick-
minded cretins of the '90s.

If you are a die-hard Brady
fan (don’t worry, there is help
out there), you may choose to
watch the . perfect

March 23 1995 3

marriage/kids facade grow just
a bit larger, but frankly, I
wouldn't waste the money.
Even shots of the ‘real’ Greg,
Alice, Peter and Mrs. B. don’t
quite cut it. For those who
were really looking forward to
the Brady Bunch meets
Generation,,,X, don’t worry,
some things will always be the
same. Mr. Brady is still very
wise, and you can bet to hear
him say more than once, “You
know, when you tattle on
someone else, you’re really
tattling on yourself telling
everyone that you’re a tattle-
tale.” And of course, Marsha
still turn heads, even though,
as the “big guy on campus” at
MTV High says, “She’s harder
to get into than a Pearl Jam
concert.”

Now I know why the Bradys
aired from 4:05-4:35 or some-
thing like that. An hour and a
half of Brady Mania is enough
to make even Ann B. Davis
look good in a teddy.

The Brady Bunch opens this
Friday, March 24, at the
Beehive at 8 and 10 p.m., plus
midnight shows Friday and
Saturday. ‘

“There is no place for
theaters in a cemetery.”

- Vilna Ghetto Librarian

It's hard for most of us who
haven’t been alive during
wartime — except for the Gulf
War, which wasn't on our own
soil — to imagine the complete
strain on the human soul.
Bedfellows for the prisoners of
the Vilna Ghetto during their
encampment between _1942-
43 were fear, uncertainty and
‘death. Unfathomable numbers
of Jews were being slaugh-
tered daily. In the face of these
trials of the human spirit, a few
people struggled to keep hope
alive using the creative arts.
Ghetto is a drama detailing the
will to survive even among the
most horrifying conditions.

The core of Ghetto is the
theater troupe (based on a
troupe that actually existed)

‘ series of

within the Vilna Ghetto that
has been asked by the Nazis
to put on a production for the
officers. What arises is a
improvisational
satires which show the actors’
acknowledgement of their life
and death situations. This play
showcases the paradoxes at
this time and place in World
war ii history caused by differ-
ences in religious and political
ideology. Conversely, for every
decision made among the
leaders of the ghetto, there
was a motivation based on
personal beliefs. There is a
question as to whether such a
theater group is welcome in
such a den of suffering. I
mean, how can one attempt to
grow through the humanities,
when there remains a constant
attack on the “humanity” of
their daily lives? How can one
learn to laugh in the midst of
torture? Artists andthespians
strove to find inspiration within
their painfully thin walls, and in
the faces of hunger surround-
ing them. In actuality, the arts
can be one of the most suc-
cessful tools, of survival within
a community which needs
some sense of emotional
escape.

Ghetto consists
of several sub-
plots dealing with
the methods ghet-
to residents
employed for sur-
vival. For exam-
ple, one resource-
ful tailor, referred
to as Weiskopf,
goes to the lead-
ers of the ghetto
proposing to set
up a business
which would
employ people to
clean Nazi sol-
dier/officer uni-
forms. This would
provide jobs for
ghetto residents
and provide a
reason for them
not to be liquidat-
ed with others,
thereby prolong- ' 5;.-

The Rapture
Siouxsie and The Banshees
Geffen

With entrance ramps being
constructed daily onto the
information highway that is
today’s society, its nice to
know Siouxsie Sioux and the
gang have shunned the tech-
nology that propelled 1991's
Superstition tothe top of the
college charts.

Getting back to basics,
Siouxsie and The Banshees
have-turned their backs on the
mechanical sounding direction
they were slowly sliding in, and
opted for a more scaled-back
sound (i.e. less synthesizers
and computers).

On Rapture, their 14th
album, the group tries to form
their Gothic/pop songs into an
ordered theme. “It begins with
innocence, not wearing
armour, everything a new
experience,” said Siouxsie.
“Then comes celebrating
beauty and joy. Finally, there's

let ‘go and say goodbye.” I
didn’t get any of that!

_ This is the first record where
I actually realized how much
difference the producer
makes. In the simplest of
terms, The Rapture is a collec-
tion of good songs mixed
together with a few bad ones.
And ironically enough, John
Cale was behind the boards
oniall thegood ones. Cale,
being a founding member of
the Velvet Underground, was
the only former musician the
band has let produce them. On
Cale-produced songs like “O
Baby,” “The Lonely One” and
“Falling Down,” the music
seems to work with the vocals
instead of competing with
them.

The most radio-friendly, “O
Baby,” “Tearing Apart.”.and
“Fall From Grace,” combine
Sioux’s drifting voice with a
steady snare/bass beat and
subtle feedback-laden guitar
riffs. The lyrics “O Baby” even
dispel the stereotypical gloom

and doom reputation of the
band, (“The cracks in the
ground grin up at me/Even the
creases in my shoes smile up
at me/T hought_ it would end in
tragedy/But l’_m swimming
around in your glory.”)

The hardest track to take is
the 10-minute—p|us “The
Rapture.” This being the pin-
nacle of the theme sequence,
(Somewhere after the “cele-
brating beauty and joy” and
before the “realization that you
have to let go and say good-
bye.”) The song starts out
impressively enough, with gui-
tars fading in an out at five-

ax reurns with 13 Unlucky Numbers and mo chaotic amoody punk.

Sose and th Banshees 6 come ac it_ more of their gothic pop.

second intervals over key-
boards and repititious brush
strokes against a snare. That
sounds good for about three or
four minutes, but then it just
keeps going with no end in
sight. (Add to it lyrics like, “The
start rebirthed in ecstasy with
cherubim and seraphim when I
was .fal|ing_soaring . A
swirling violent stream mystic
majestic entangled in a web of
curling vapor thread.”) What?
In an age when Aerosmith
even know how to get onthe
Internet, it's a relief to know
that Siouxsie and The
Banshees have traded in their

computer enhanced sound for
the original guitar, bass, drum
sound they began with. For a
band that started out with Sid
Vicious on drums, the group
has gone through a multitude
of changes only to come full
circle. Now all that's left is to
get Cale to produce the entire
disc ‘next time.

Christmas has come in

The new release is similar to

the previous album that comes

The Tonight Show starring Jay
Leno
Monday-Friday 11:35 p.m. NBC

 

For what he does, Jay Leno isn't
that bad. Never cryptic or cutting-
edge, Leno walks the straight line of
the late-night talk shows. There is
nothing new in his actions or ideas,
and while he's mildly humorous at
times, he never treads too far onto the
territory of others. in other words, The
Tonight Show is boring.

Opinion of the program aside, I feel
sorry for the guy. He follows in the
footsteps of a TV. legend (Johnny
Carson) and then must immediately
clash with the new hipster of the
month, Arsenio Hall (proof that there
is no God), and soon afterwards
Letterman. He can't buy a break, and
yet he hardly seems to be trying.

The curse has felled more than one
good man, the curse being to take to

the place of a true star. “Fantasy-

lsland" fell to pieces when Herve
Villachez was replaced. The same
goes for Dick Seargent on
“Bewitched” and Shelly Long on
“Cheers.” Giants, all of them.

Carson dwarfed them all (yes, even
Tatoo). He was entertaining, quick
and friendly. Even a cynic like myself
wasn't repulsed. When he left, Jay
Leno, stand-up comic and freak of
nature, stepped in and tried to contin-
ue in the same vein. Leno quickly
began to mimic the wit of Carson, the
down-home friendliness. He failed. .

The charisma of those before him is

'_''lost on Leno. He's edgy and uncom-
‘ -fbrtable, unable to reach out to his

guests in any real way. There is rarely
any real substance on his show (the
people tell a story, talk about a pro-

ject, then move over one seat), and
seldom do any of these people look as
if they're having fun. For them it is
merely part of their job, and for Leno it
seems the same. There are no catchy
connections between host and guest,
no reoccuring persons to entertain
once every other week (like Tony
Randall on Letterman and Ed Koch on
Conan O’Brien), nothing to make
someone want to watch night after
night. His jokes are predictable (not to
say that all stand-up comedy isn’t), his
interviews are boring and gentle, and
his demeanor is annoyingly kind. Leno
is just there.

The Tonight Show is the same
today as it was 10 years ago or even.
twenty, and there is no reason to
expect that anything will be changing
in the near future. Any alteration in the
format would surely kill its rating and
probably Leno's job, and there’s no
real reason to do it. As I said earlier,
Leno knows just how to do the deed,
and he’ll continue to do so.

Yet Leno seems uneasy, as if he's
looking over his shoulder constantly,
but he shouldn’t worry. Who he aims
to please, those that predated the
yuppies, won’t leave him because
they have nothing else to go to.
Letterman is still too quirky for them,
and all the other choices are on too
late. So The Tonight Show will con-
tinue to feature Buddy Hackett and
Don Flickles (along with the other
guests trying to peddle their latest film
or TV show), and those who have
watched it for years will continue to do
so.

guarantee there is evidence of many,
varied musical tastes.

Their new album does show progres-
sion. lt hass more depth, combining
powerchords, speed and repetition.
Each song jumps from stylistic
extremes. Like “What Else Can We
Do,” the new album combines a high
energy and_ repetitious pop-punk style
with soul, aka Wax. The band hasn't
created a new form of music, just per-
sonalized it. On songs like “Who Is
Next” and “Tom in Two,” the band best
shows its ability to intercut their clean
hyperspeed style with other ones. The
lyrics are both unrestrained and har-
monic, mostly done in silly, humble
abstract first person narrative. The
content is more personal than political,
dealing with seemingly trivial situations
that occur in everyday life. This down-
to-earthiness is evident in the song

“Just A Visitor” and silliness in the _

Beach—Boyesque “California.”

So get the album. For a small fortune
you get the variety of a large buffet.
Where else can you get an album that
has “music you can break stuff to”
while screaming the chorus, then later
makes you want to sway back and
forth to the harmony of the vocals and
mellow basslines?

Prick
Prick
Nothing

I

Prick is a newcomer signed to Trent
Reznor’s new record label, Nothing. I
could make this review extremely short
by merely mentioning that the album is
engineered by Trent Reznor and mixed
by Alan Moulder, but I'm not one for
brevity when it comes to music (unless

Bill says so). For those of you out there
who don’t pay any attention to the fine
print on your album covers, Alan
Moulder is a supremely divine record

producer who has immortalized.

exceedingly talented bands such as
Ride, Swervedriver, Erasure and a few
other British delights that escape my
memory right now. And if you don’t
know who Trent Reznor is, ya’ betta’
ask somebody.

The lead vocalist/songwriter, Kevin
McMahon, is my kinda man. He sings
with all of the unstable, dysfunctional
angst that you’d expect from a Fleznor
protege. McMahon’s cynical serenades
are so three-dimensional that i could
actually imagine him pouncing around
my room like some supernatural video
game rubric. Prick is industrial glam
rock with a hint of progressive house
flair and lots of electric bughouse rawk.
It's also good dance music. But when I
first heard this album I didn’t want to
dance, I wanted to fly! I think that if I
listen to it enough it's possible. .

The lyrics are discordantly poetic.
They go so well with the music. One of
my favorites is “Other People,” a song
about fast and frisky female promiscu-
ity. McMahon calmly chimes in with
“She said you’re a boy/and I am a
woman/and that was what she
said/you love me and I need you/she
planted in my head/in my head/she
planted in my head/if you don’t want it
other people will.” The music then
shifts to a slashing electric guitar with
weltering drum beats and an interstel-
lar keyboard riff, in which McMahon
hoarsely attacks you with “I need to get
to know you first/I need to get to know/I
need to get to know you first/I need to
get to know.” Then it shifts back to a
calm rolling guitar with a new, more
exciting verse. I love that song! There
are other songs on the album of equal
merit such as “Communique,” this neu-
rotic tune with a wicked bassand
raunchy cathode-ray vocals. “Tough”

definitely has some electronic musical
influences and would probably do just
as well on a “rave” compilation album.
In fact, I think Prick would kick ass in
the techno rave music scene.
McMahon has all of the vocal potential
to do whatever the hell he wants, but
techno or industrial would not be a far
stretch for this album at all. It has

“Make Believe” is the only tamed

Yelling At Mary
Mary Karlzen
Atlantic

You go to one Indigo Girls
concert ‘and you’re labeled a
fan of folk-pop-country (fop
country? folk pountry?) for life:
Which easily explains why I’m
reviewing Mary Karlzen.

Where to begin? The disc
Yelling At Mary starts _out
pretty strong, stumbles a little
in the middle, picks itself up
again and ends up landing on
its face.

For the most part the back-
up music sounds great.
Seasoned musicians, like
drummer Kenny Arnoff (John
Mellencamp), guitarist
Benmont Tench (The
Heartbreakers) and guitarist
David Hidalgo (Los Lobos)
mesh together perfectly to form
a back-up band that could prop
up almost the weakest of voic-
es. Enter the exception,
Karlzen. With a voice about
three octaves higher than
Victoria Williams and Nancy
Griffith combined, there’s a
good possibility Karlzen could
peel the paint off the side of a

barn in a matter of just three ‘
songs. It's not that she sings .

badly, it just sounds like she's
talking to ababy at times.

Yelling At Mary, the sec-
ond full-length album from
Karlzen, borrows more from
pop than any other genre, but
does tend to coat a few of the
songs in a thin layer of coun-
try. And yet, the pop base still
manages to bleed through
(especially on “Dimestore
Life,” “Anywhere is Better
Than Here” and “St. James
Hotel”.) The lyrics on these
three songs, in particular,
borrow themes and lyrics
from just about every country
song ever composed —— “She
was sixteen/Never knew
more than the backporch
swing and the counter at the
dimestore...” (“Dimestore
Life”.) And on “St. James
Hotel” Karlzen sings of a
hotel outside of Mexico
haunted by a dead poker-
playing ghost. This song real-
ly makes me laugh, but I’m
sure that isn't Karlzen’s inten-
tion, — “He was called out of
the room/And the cards he
hid/Well they fell to the
floor/He don’t play cards no
more.”

However, the disc does
have its redeeming moments
wedged in the middle,
(Probably in a clever attempt
to keep you listening to the
end.) The first single, ‘‘I’d Be
Lying”, is searching for the
perfect home that only VH1
can provide, (trivia to impress
your fiends with — Karlzen’s

_ ‘93 EP “Hide” spawned sev-
’ eral heavily rotated clips,

earning her the distinction of
being the most played indie
artist on that network.) ‘‘I’d Be
Lying,” along with the impres-
sive “Wooden Man,” detail
the crumbling of a relation-
ship. Come to think of it,
almost every song here is
about a falling or failed rela-

tionship.

Yelling At Mary could be a
really good album. The lyrics
lack originality, but the music
itself is well-crafted. Now all it
needs is a singer to match.
Maybe Natalie Merchant or
Edie Brickell, I understand
they’re both in search of a
back-up band after letting
their guys go.

Greater exposure for college
baseball will not just help the

TV stations that carry it, but will

bring more respect to college
baseball and help sway more
pro prospects to make their

mark in college before trying for

the big leagues.

Another problem some base-
ball purists have with college
baseball is the aluminum bat
and the weak “ping” which '
resounds from even the hardest
hit balls.

I say be reasonable. This is the

same bat that brings an offen-
sive dimension to the college
game which the major leagues
have missed for years. Go to a
college game some time and
you will not see many innings -
go by without players rounding
the bases on big hits. Anybody
who likes baseball will like the
college game, and I’ll bet those
who say it is boring at the col-
lege level haven’t seen it.

should step in. Not only will TV
be providing a valuable service
for sports fans, but it will be
able to cash in when college ball
catches on.

I realize we won't be seeing
regular season games on the net-
works anytime soon, but would
it be totally unreasonable for
some type of smaller, more spe-
cialized channels to take its
chances with college baseball?

I would think that KBL, for
instance, would get at least as
many viewers for a Pitt-UConn
baseball game as it would for an
International Hockey League
game. e

The action is more fast-paced
than the majors, and you can bet
on a lot more scoring. The col-
lege dimension can only add to
the overall popularity baseball,
especially to those who starve
for it at this time of year.

And best of all, you can count
on college players never to go
on strike.
