School of Medicine Moves
To 0’Hara Street Building

 one of the majo_r.<>

 9f the current year. the
 of Medic.ine‘—has expanded
into the old Mellon Institute build-
ing on =O’Hara street.

The move has approximately
doubled the space occupied by this
major University division. For
over a year, after the Mellon In-
stitute had removed into its new
Greek temple, alterations and im-
provements were made in the
building, preparatory to its occu-
pancy by the Medical School.

The first floor of the remodeled
building contains the library stacks
and the student lounge and locker
rooms. On the second floor are the
administrative oﬂices and the li-
brary. The library, which formerly
contained the Mellon collection, has
been enlarged and is now the com-
bined Dental and Medical library.
Two .lectu_re rooms are also located
on this ﬂoor.

The -third floor is devoted entire-
ly to the department of physiolog-
ical chemistry. The student, staff,
and -research labs as well as the
departmental offices are situated
there. The department of industrial
hygiene and the department of
pharmacology are on the fourth
floor. Both departments have their
laboratories there.

The ﬁfth ﬂoor ‘houses one unit,
the department of physiology,
-which has its student labs and its
research labs alongside it. The
sixth floor contains quarters for
the animals the school uses for re-
search purposes.

The important feature of the
move is that the six laboratory
departments, anatomy, physiologi-
cal chemistry, physiology, pharma-
cology, pathology, and bacteriology,
have six complete and individual
laboratories. This is just twice as
much space as they formerly oc-
cupied.

Under the heading of increased
facilities comes the addition of the
new Presbyterian hospital to the
roll of University aﬂiliated hos-
pitals. This conveniently located
addition will be used for the teach-
ing of clinical medicine and of
surgery.

Pennsylvania hall, the original
Medical School building on the hill,
houses the departments of anat-
omy, pathology. and bacteriology
with their respective student and
research laboratories. The depart-
ment of microscopic anatomy boasts
a newly remodeled and modemly
equipped laboratory in the old
building.

Wellesley Historian
To Address Inquiry

Dr. Joseph Haroutunian, assist-
ant professor of history at Welles-
ley college, will speak on “True
and False Radicalism” at the third
meeting of the YM-YWCA-spon-
sored Inquiry Forum next Monday
at 1 o’clock in 129 Cathedral.

Leading a discussion of the real-
istic approach to social problems,
Dr. Haroutunian will attempt to
explain why so many social re-
forms fail.

'Born of Armenian parents in
Marash, Turkey, he has attended
educational institutions all over the
world. After the World War he
spent four years in the American
university in Beirut, Syria.

In 1923 he came to the United
States and entered Columbia uni-
versity, receiving his doctor’s de-
gree in 1926. Following a year of
graduate work in philosophy, he
entered Union theological seminary
in New York, from which he re-
ceived the degree of doctor of di-
vinity.

Columbia unive_rsity conferred
upon him the degree of doctor of
philosophy in 1932.

Dr. Haroutunian has been affili-
ated with Wellesley college since
1932, when he became a lecturer in
Biblical history. He became assist-
ant professor of Biblical history in
1935.

Active in YMCA work, Dr. Har-
outunian spoke at the Eagles’ Mere
conference _last spring and will be
leader of the annual fall retreat
this week-end at Camp Luther-
wood.

nounced today.

During this period tomorrow
night, elevators will not run, and
no electric lighting will be avail-
able.

The power shut-olf will be

motors operating in connection
with experimental work.

Pitt Peace Council
Holds Symposium

Holding a symposium on “Is An
Alliance with Great Britain Col-
lective Security,” the Pitt Peace

Hiram Milton, C42, was elected
recording secretary at the last
meeting.

Commenting on the recent mer-
g_er of the council with the Inter-
national Relations Club, Rosemary
Lutz, C39, chairman of the council,
says: “The junction should give us
more access to academic literature
on international affairs and the
offer to join the international club
is a compliment to the student
body’s desire for peace.”

Number 8

Berlin Artist
Wins 1938
International

French Painters
Secure Majority
Of Prize Awards

Karl Hofer of Berlin, Germany,
was awarded first prize for his
canvas, “The Wind,” last night at
the formal opening of the 1938
Carnegie International Exhibition.

The prize, which carries with it
an award of $1000, is the ﬁrst in
the history of the International to
go to a German artist.

It was France, however, who
capturedthe majority of awards,
ﬁve out of the eight presented an-
nually. Maurice de Vlaminck won
$600 for his painting entitled
“Winter.’,’ First and second honor-
able mentions were awarded to Al-

bert Marquet and Maurice Utrillo

for “Le Pont Neuf” and “Consulat
d’Auvergnc, rue Norvins.”

Edmond Ceria’s “Game“ was
given fourth honorable mention
with a cash prize of $100 and the
Allegheny .County Garden Club
prize of $300 was paid to Roger
Chapelain-Midy for his “Bouquet
at the Window.” ' “

The United States was rep-

resented among the award winners
by Arnold Bland, ’--whose “People"
received third prize; and by Rock-
well Kent, named third honorable
mention, for his “Storm Clouds,
Greenland.”
'_: Of note;-in this year's exhibition
IS that the prize-winning paintings
are of less advanced tendencies
than the honor canvases of last
year. Hofer, the “classic modern,”
has refined many of the complex
and unruly elements of modern
painting and reduced them to a
kind of order.

His style, severe and thoughtful,
places its emphasis on construc-
tion. It is, however, softened by
the use of a rich textural surface
and a still richer color. ,

Vlaminck’s art is of the utmost

Intercollegiate . . .
Now It Can Be Told

New York university is now of-
fering degree-credit courses in
safety education . . . A majority of
Rollins college students and faculty
members have voted to abolish foot-
ball as an intercollegiate sport. Yes,
that word was ‘_‘abolish.” _ _

Stanford university physlclsts
are perfecting a light that is 4,000
degrees hotter than the sun’s sur-
face . . . there will be a hot time
in the whole town at night.

Financial N otes

Brown university would like it
to be known that it has a boathouse
valued at $10,000 . . . They got out
their adding machines out in Chl-
cago recently, and found.that gifts
to the University of ‘Chicago dur-
ing the nine years in which Dr.
Robert M. Hutchins has been its
president total $52,000,000.

Off to College

Varsity Village will be the name
of a new group of “hoinelike” stu-
dent residences at Niagara ,un1-
versity . . . We hope they won t. be
disturbed by the sound of running
water . . . The Rockefeller Founda-
tion has made a grant Of $18,090.-
000 to American university to bring
government employees of Latin-
American republics to study Uncle
Sam’s government . . . Transpor-
tation rates must have gone up.

Thank You, Mrs. Rose

One of the rules for fast reading
which Mrs. Florence C. Rose, direc-
tor of remedial reading work at
Smith college, recently gave to Co-
lumbia university students _was:
To skim, let your eyes zig-zag
across the page, reading some of
the words, not all of them, and
slowing down on parts of special
interest . . . And now we shall go
off and skim.

LONG-WINDED SCIENTISTS

E: Z. Friedenberg, Centenary
College, speaking at convention
of scientists:

“Far too many scientists are
ridiculous because they write

SEARCH FOR TRUTH

Dr. A. Lawrence Lowell, president-
emeritus, Harvard University:

“Experience has proved, and
probably no one would now deny,
that knowledge can advance, or at
least can advance most rapidly,
only by means of an unfettered
search for truth on the part of
those who devote their lives to
seeking it in their respective ﬁelds,
and by complete freedom in im-
parting to their pupils the truth
they have found."

THE PITT NEWS

Bleakley/lttends University
After Regaining Sight

After 11 years of darkness, Har-'

old Bleakley, who entered the Uni-
versity this fall as a freshman, is
again living in a world of colors,
lights, and shadows, a world all the
more fascinating today because he
was shut out of it for so long.

A game of Indian, played with
crude bows and arrows made of the
steel ribs ripped from an umbrella,
resulted in the accident which de-
prived the then nine-year—old boy
of his sight.

Only the left eye was injured,
but, a few days after the accident,
the other eye became blind also.
Months of treatment in a darkened
room followed, but the right eye
retained only one-half of one per
cent of normal sight.

Two years later in 1929, his re-
education was begun at the West-
ern Pennsylvania School for the
Blind. By the time he had reached
the seventh grade, he had prog-
ressed far enough in adapting him-
self to his new world to hitch-hike
from the school to his home, a dis-
tance of about 25 miles.

Since his sight was not com-
pletely gone, he could distinguish
light from dark slightly. But, in
hitch-hiking, he said, he did have
trouble in locating the cars after
they had stopped and in finding
the door handle.

He missed his graduation at the
school last spring because he was
in New York recovering from the
operation which was to restore his
sight.

Since he was under a local anes-
thetic during the operation, Harold
knew what was going on. “I could
tell during the operation,” he said,
“that I was going to be able to
see.” As the surgeon worked with
his eye, Bleakley could see the light
returning, little by little.

All was not clear sailing, how-
ever, for, three days after the op-
eration, a hemorrhage covered the
new opening which had been made
in his eye, and delayed his recovery.

Nevertheless, Harold was able to
leave the hospital two weeks after
the operation, and a few days later
was able to distinguish cars three
blocks away. His vision had been
restored to 21 per cent of normal.
He thinks that it is probably 36 or
37 per cent of normal today.

Although Harold is not permitted
to read yet, he is allowed -to see
movies. He particularly likes the
pictures done in technicolor, and
thinks the movie industry as a
whole has made marked progress
in the past 11 years, not only in
correcting such technical defects as
jerky movements, but also in mak-
ing up the actors and actresses so
that they look more natural.

Among other things that sur-
prise and, in this case, slightly
amuse him today, are women’s hats.
He admits that they do have more
individuality now than they had in
1927. He is gradually getting used
to seeing them.

Even before he had the operation
on his eye and knew that he would
be able to see, Harold had planned

3

on entering the University. When
he has ﬁnished his course here, he
hopes to write for a newspaper.

Besides writing, he is interested
in amateur photography both in
making the pictures, and in de-
veloping them. In addition to this
he is working on a book, but he
has not had time to do much
with it since he started to the Uni-
versity. During the summer, he
wrote a series of articles on his
recovery which are being syndi-
cated.

YM-YWCA to Hold
Week-End Retreat

Discussing “The Modern Ver-
sion of the Bible,” the YM-YWCA
will hold a retreat tomorrow and
Sunday at Camp Lutherwood.

Dr. Joseph Haroutunian, of Wel-
lesley college and noted instructor
in the Bible, will lead the retreat,
for which signees will meet at the
First Baptist church at 1 o’clock
tomorrow.

A session will be held at 3
o’clock tomorrow, after which din-
ner will be served. In the evening,
hikes and a campﬁre will be held;
Sunday’s program will consist of
practically the same program.

All students interested in join-
ing this retreat should sign up in
the Y oflice, says William W. Men-
denhall, executive secre-tary of the
YMCA.

Biologist Collects
Rare Plant Species

Dr. 0. E. Jennings, head of the
biology department, and curator of
botany at the Carnegie museum,
made a collecting trip to Canada
this summer. Dr. Jennings col-
lected plant specimens in the re-
gion of Beaumaris, a small town
on Lake Muskoka, in Ontario.

The collection includes several
hundred specimens, representative
of all types of vegetation growing
in the region, from small ﬂowers
to large trees.

Especially interesting was a
specimen of Pincushion Moss esti-
mated to be about 250 years old.
This species grows very slowly,
and, when collected by Dr. Jen-
nings, was about a foot in width.

Pitt Meets Big Badger
Team In Madison Game

Pitt’s untamed Golden Panthers©
will be clawing for their fourth
straight victory of the season wher
they tangle with the undefeatec
Wisconsin Badgers, Big Ten POW
erhouse, tomorrow afternoon a
Madison, Wisconsin in one of th
feature intersectional clashes o:
the day.

A victory over Pitt this yea
will be a delectable feather in an.
one’s football bonnet—and Wiscon
sin is collecting feathers. Mai
quette, who last week dumpe
Southern Methodist 7-0, fell befoi
Wisconsin 27 to 0. The Badge?
stepped into a tie with _M1nnes0'~
for ﬁrst place in the Big Ten L
downing Iowa last Saturday, 31-1‘

Coach Harry. Stuhldreher wiT
ﬁeld a big, fast, and experience
team that will try for the Jackpi
after three lean years. This '
Stuhldreher’s third year with tl_
Big Tenners and the year that Wl
pay dividends for the past two se:
sons of experimenting.

Reading from left to right th
Badger line will average 19
pounds despite 165 pounder Joh
O’Brien. 0’Brien is one of tho:
vest pocket guards that has mad
the Notre Dame style famous. Dl
spite the return of numerous vet
erans a few crack sophomores have
edged into the line—up.

Star End

Lorenz, one of the first year men
ﬁres into enemy backﬁelds from hi
end position and was the ﬁfth ma.-
in the Marquette backﬁeld. Turn
ing his end is tougher than gettin;
a 50-yard seat for the Fordhar.
game. .

Pivotman Jack Murray ranks
with the country's top-ﬂight cen-
ters and sparked the Badger line
in the ﬁrst two games. Back of thc
strong Wisconsin line lurks a back
ﬁeld that’s leading the Big Tex
scorers. Vince Govre at quarter
Johnny Schmitz and Bellin at
halves, and Howard Weiss at full
completes the battery that wil
pound the Panther “Maginot” line.

Schmitz is a brilliant runner and
deadly passer. Against Iowa he
pounded the flanks and tossed
strikes to Bellin and Lorenz. Full-
back Weiss is a triple threat man.

Fourth Jinx

Stuhldreher, a proponent of the
N otre Dame system, will be able to
work two teams against the Pan-
thers. The difference between his
ﬁrst two teams is very slight.

Pitt will be battling the fourth
game jinx. In the past ﬁve years
no Pitt team has been able to cross
the fourth game line without sully-
ing their records. Defeats by Min-
nesota, Duquesne, and ties by
Fordham makes up the Panther
football history for those games.

The Panthermen have yet to
shake loose a ball carrier for a
long run. Cassiano’s 46 yard jaunt
to the Duquesne ﬁve yard line was
the lengthiest trip taken by a Pitt
backﬁeld man. All Pitt ground
traveling has been done by long
marches with the Sutherland
Scythe slicing oﬂ’ ﬁve, six, and
seven yard chunks at a clip.

Coach Jock Sutherland may be
forced to change the line-up that
has answered the opening whistle
for every game. A1 Lezouski, in-
Jured in the Duquesne game, may
not be ready by game time, and
Butch Klein will handle the guard
assignment.

Potts Establishes Bulletin Board, Requests
Cooperation From Intramural Players

Failure of contestants to appear
for some of the scheduled matches
in the touch football, tennis and
horseshoe tournaments has brought
to the fore a very important aspect
of the intramural athletics pro-
gram.

For the program to be the suc-
cess which it gives promise of be-
ing, students must cooperate to thc
utmost with those in charge of thi
program. More than 70.touch foot-
ball games will be played during
the season and it is impossible tt
schedule those games so that every-
one will be satisﬁed.

Some of the games must bl
played on Saturday, a day incon-
venient for many of the players,
but it is highly probable that
enough boys can be present for thc
Saturday matches to keep the num-
ber of postponements at a mini-
mum.

As an added incentive for boys

to be on hand for Saturday games.

the gymnasium and swimming pool
will be at the disposal of the play-
ers after the football games have
been completed. This will include
use of ping pong tables, handball
courts, and the like.

No longer may men miss games

and offer the excuse that they
“couldn’t ﬁnd the schedule.” All;
schedules and announcements af-l
fecting the Fraternity, Engineer-ll
ing, ROTC, and Independent3
Leagues will be posted every morn-
ing on one of the bulletin boards
on the ground floor of the Cathe-
:lral, according to Jim Potts.
Information regarding the pair-
ings for the elimination horseshoe
and tenis tournaments, which be-

gin Tuesday, will be found on the .

Cathedral bulletin board Monday
morning, as will the touch football
schedule for the remainder of the
week.

Touch football games scheduled
for today have Band Company A
neeting Company E at 3 o’clock,
‘\lewman Club clashing with Chem
Specials at 4 o’clock, and Chemical
