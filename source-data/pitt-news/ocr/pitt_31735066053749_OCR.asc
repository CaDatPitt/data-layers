SGB debates $3,! 00 leadership program

Jennifer‘ _Stine

   

More than 20 student leaders from

campus organizations packed the
Student Government Board meeting last
night in an effort to show their support
for a program aimed at ending student
apathy in general and improving the
leadership of campus organizations.
The attempt to better the student
body is called the Grass Roots
Organizing Weekends (GROW), and the

program involves three days of intense
leadership training by former student
activists.

Earlier this week, the Allocations
Committee voted to defer the request for
the $3,100 needed to send 45 campus
leaders to a GROW session.

Fearing that this decision would
lead to a complete denial of the request
for the $3100, members of the Black
Action Society, Campus Women’s
Organization, Asian Students’
Association, and the United States

 
 

City Council candidate strives
to increase student voting

Christene Muller

 

Pitt alumnus Kevin Fischer cam-
paigned for a position on the Pittsburgh
City Council at Phillips Park in Carrick
yesterday, focusing much of his speech
on the need, for young people and college
students to register to vote.

Because many Pitt students are not
originally from Pittsburgh, Fischer said
that many of them don’t know they can

register to vote for Pittsburgh city ofﬁ-

cials instead of just officials in their
hometown.
Robert Frank, a Pitt University

(democrat, is Fischer’s assistant. Frank is

working with Fischer to get students to
register and vote.

Frank said many students don’t
know how easy it is to vote thanks to ini-
tiatives like the “motor voter” plan. The
plan is set up so that when a person goes

. to register a car he can register to vote at

the same time in the same ofﬁce. This

Student Association came out in full
force to voice their support for GROW.

The students present felt that
GROW’s instruction in organization,
motivation and mobilization would be a
valuable tool for getting students
involved on a campus they view as
increasingly apathetic.

Creighton Moorhead, vice president
of the Black Action Society, feels that
GROW is a necessary program for Pitt.

“We are known as an apathetic cam-
pus,” Moorhead said. “No one wants to

Former Student Government
Board member Keith Campbell, a
senior majoring in political science, is
working in Washington D.C. to make
dealing with ﬁnancial aid easier for
college students.

' The United States Student
Association appointed Campbell as a
student advisor to the U.S. Department
of Education on a program known as

Easy Access for Students and
Institutions.
The ‘appointment requires

Campbell to stay in Washington D.C.
this semester, but he’s still a full—time
student and takes external study class-
es through Pitt. _

“They brought me into_ this pro-
gram mainly because I know a lot
about student aid programs,” Campbell
said. . ‘

As part of the project, Campbell
helps review federal aid regulations
and consults on the EASI web page.
He is just one of three students work-
ing on EASI and is there to give a stu-
dent’s perspective on the project,
which he feels is important to the pro-
gram’s success.

“Students have their own speciﬁc
interest, it may notbe the same as the
University of Pittsburgh’s,” Campbell
said. “Those concerns need to be heard
separately. What the project seeks to
do is revamp ﬁnancial aid and make it
more student and school centered.”

be leaders.” '

Moorhead feels that the implemen-
tation of GROW will‘ help change all
that.

Christa Douaihy, a Campus
Women’s Organization member, agrees
with Moorhead. She said that our cam-
pus leaders are like teachers, and that
they affect whether students fall asleep,
or wake up and become involved.
“Students need dynamic teachers and
leaders,” Douaihy said.

member is

appointed to post in D.C.

Campbell pointed out that one of
the main problems with the current
financial aid system is the sharing of
information between schools and stu-
dents. He used an example of a student
registering for a class and finding that
there’s a hold on his financial account.
The student can’t find out what’s
wrong from the registrar’s office
because the computer there doesn’t
always have access to that ﬁnancial aid
information from the government or
the ﬁnancial aid office.

“These systems aren’t talking to
each other. On a campus level, offices
that deal in financial aid should be inte-
grated,” Campbell said. “Students
want to see a system where they can
get information quickly.”

He said the different offices that

deal with financial aid might be inte-
grated by linking computers over the
lntemet. This way a student in that sit-
uation wouldn’t need to run around
campus. The registrar could call up the
information right there.

This is one way the EASI project
seeks to make accessing ﬁnancial aid
easier, by upgrading and incorporating
the computer technology of the federal
and state financial aid system.
Campbell said that putting ﬁnancial
aid information on-line would be more
accessible and make applying for,
receiving, and managing ﬁnancial aid
easier.

Campbell also said this would
allow the creation of electronic student

Fulbright scholar teaches

 

THE PITT N_EWS 2 _ A

about European Law at Pitt

Charisse E. Merchant

- .-. mx:«.5:' .~.<r:—.-.~

The University of Pittsburgh
School of Law is now one of three
schools in the United States to host a
Fulbright scholar in residence. Kurt
Riechenberg, Pitt’s Fulbright scholar in
residence, will teach at the law school

. for the 1-996-97 academic school year.

Despite the fact that the law school
will host Riechenberg, he said that he
has other responsibilities to the
University as a whole.

“I will be teaching other courses
like “European Economic Integration”
in the Honors College, and I will be
lecturing occasionally for the Graduate
School of Public & International
Affairs,” said Riechenberg. '

Riechenberg will also be teaching
classes in European law such as “Law
of the European Union” in the fall and
“Environmental Law” in the spring. He
feels such classes are important to
American law students.

“It’s essential for American law
students to take these classes because
some may choose to work in multi-
national companies, public relations,
and international business travel,”
Riechenberg said. “Knowledge in
European Union [law] will be an
asset.”

This is not I the first time
Riechenberg has taught at the
University of Pittsburgh. “In the fall
semester of 1993, I taught at GSPIA.
Ronald Brand, professor of law and
Cile director, instrumented that teach-
ing position for me,” he said.

The University, along with
Riechenberg, were both ‘ awarded the
honor of uniting European Union law
and American law students by the
Fulbright Commission. According to
Riechenberg, the purpose is to bring
professionals in the European Union to
teach American law students in order

to increase U.S. and European ‘rela-
tions.

“Professionals could be govem—
ment officials, lawyers, judges; anyone
who is employed by the European
Union,” Riechenberg said.

Pitt and Riechenberg were award-
ed this grant from the Fulbright
Commission after both applied and
revealed interests in European law in
relation to American law students. '

Schools in the U.S. apply on the
students’ behalf and individuals in
Europe apply to teach. The two are
matched accordingly by the Fulbright
Commission.

The program allows American pro-
fessors to teach in Europe or European
professors to come to the U.S.

“The Fulbright Commission spon-
sors academic exchanges between
teachers and students. The exchange
could go‘ either way.” said
Riechenberg.

The grant for teaching awarded to
Riechenberg allows him to stay and
teach at Pitt for two semesters. His liv-
ing expenses are jointly paid for by Pitt
and the Fulbright Commission.

Riechenberg has had a wide vari-
ety of teaching experience. He taught
at the University of Paris II School of
Law from 1980 to 1981. Since 1985 he
has been teaching at the University of
Luxembourg, where he is a permanent
lecturer. He has also been a guest lec-
turer at many other universities.

Along with his extensive teaching
experience and his current employment
at the European Union, Riechenberg

has had many publications. Between’

the years 1988 to 1996, he has pub-
lished 13 journals. He was awarded
this grant based on his versatile knowl-

edge of European law.
Riechenberg said that after his two

semesters of teaching at Pitt, he will
return to Europe for a job with the
European Court of Justice.

Despite the positive things said
about GROW, Allocations Committee
Chair Noelle Campagna said the com-
mittee had some concerns about spend-
ing $3,100 on only 45 students and was
unclear on what the GROW program
was about.

But student Yarone Zober said the
program’s beneﬁts reach far beyond the
45 people sent to the program, and will
also beneﬁt the members of their orga-
nizations. “You may as well invite the
whole campus,” Zober said.

Although students "at the meeting
claim the campus doesn’t care about
most issues, the large turnout at the
meeting indicates that apathy is not
completely rampant on our campus.

 plan was designed to try and make it eas-

ier for people to vote.

Fischer and Frank stressed that it is
not too late for students to register to
vote. There is over a month for students
to register before the Nov. 5 elections or
they can register the day of the election
with a court registration.

Frank said that any students with
questions could call him at 431-3346 for
more information.

Fischer cited the Bigelow Boulevard
closing as a reason Pitt students should
take their concerns to the polls when city
elections come by. The decisions city
council and other local ofﬁces make
affect students’ lives on campus.

Fischer said that the large student
population potentially gives Pitt a very
strong inﬂuence in city politics. “The
University also supplies many jobs for
the area, and has inﬂuence there, too.” he
said.

Fischer said he did not attend the
Bigelow Boulevard hearings, but said
that Pitt students should be ready to deal
with an urban atmosphere.

He said that many students go to Pitt

- because it is close to home or because the

tuition is lower than some schools, but
don’t come for the “country campus.”

Fischer warned of the University’s
lobby for the trial closing of Bigelow.
Once the trial closing occurs, Pitt adrnin—
istration becomes “too big, and too pow-
erful,” Fischer said.

As a politician, Fischer said he
would like to keep Pitt administrators
happy because of the jobs the University
supplies for the area, but said he also sees
the major trafﬁc problem the Bigelow
shutdown would cause as a negative
inﬂuence on the community. .

Fischer graduated from Pitt in 1984
with a BA. in political science. He went
on to Robert Morris and graduated in
1986 with a master’s in business.

Fischer, at 34, is one of the youngest
local politicians running for office, and is
currently working for Frank Lucchino in
the county controller’s ofﬁce.

Three years ago Fischer ran for the
same office, and came in at a close
fourth.

dents access to their records.
“Students could go to the computer
lab and access their account balance
or see how much they owe in loans,”
Campbell said.

These accounts would contain all
the student’s financial information
and would be transmitted to other
schools if the student transfers, elim-
inating the need to fill out more
forms, and wait in more lines.

Some other possibilities pursued
by the EASI project are allowing stu-
dents to apply for aid 24 hours a day
through the Internet and renewing aid
electronically through federal data-
bases, eliminating the need for Free

EASI has already taken a step
toward making financial aid informa-
tion available on line. Campbell said
the project EASI home page, at
http://

how to plan for, apply, and receive

financial aid as well as paying for

Campbell said it also contains
information on college admissions

ing a college, links to other college
pages, and even a search function to
help students ﬁnd other information
pertaining to college or financial aid.

Announcing her candidacy as a
democrat for the State House seat
from Mt. Lebanon yesterday,
Coleen Vuono stressed the signifi-
cance of her experiences outside of
the political realm.

Aside from her 15 years in gov-
ernment, including her position as
the Commissioner for Mt.
Lebanon’s First Ward, Vuono said
her family roles “as mother, wife,
and daughter” taught her lessons
and provided her with the experi-
ence that “no professional training
or job could.”

She reminded the crowd of her
elderly father’s death two years ago
of leukemia. “Knowing first-hand

. the struggles families with an ail-

ing parent confront daily, I will
fight for affordable and quality
health care for seniors who wish to
remain at home with their loved
ones,” Vuono said.

Vuono expressed her concern as
a mother for children’s education,
and vowed to make sure schools
receive their fair share of state
funding if she’s elected to represent
the 42nd district.

Vuono said other issues of her
platform include cutting business
taxes to encourage growth for local
companies and to entice new busi-

Vuono said she hoped to avoid
any tax raises by ensuring the
methods of state government
remain “cost—effective,” but said
she will fight to retain former fed-
eral programs that are designed to
help women, children, and the
elderly.

Setting standards which make
teachers accountable for their job
performance is another high priori-
ty on Vuono’s list.

Vuono,
mate Mike Dawida, is widely
known for her unsuccessful attempt
in the 1995 race for Allegheny
County Commissioner.

Vuono admits the name recog-
nition could benefit her chances
this year, but said she wants voters
to concentrate on her credentials
and platform.

After campaigning for over
eight months now, Vuono intends
to continue her door—to"-door visits
so people will get to know the per-
son behind the name.

“The great thing about this
campaign [for state representative]
is it allows me to be one on one
with people,” said Vuono. “That’s
why I would encourage students to
participate in smaller races like this
one. If you like grass-roots politics,
this is what it’s all about.”

 Nukes!
Support the ban

The United Nations is currently working on a
Nuclear Test Ban Treaty. This is the right direction for
the world to be heading. ’

Nuclear testing releases harmful radiation into the
atmosphere. Considering the fact that pollution due to
industry and private consumption is regulated and gener-
ally discouraged, shouldn’t nuclear testing be forbidden
as well? Perhaps we should just drop nuclear bombs on
landfills, and take care of both, problems at once.

What benefit does nuclear testing have anyway? We
already have enough nuclear weapons to destroy the
entire planet. Is someone going to build a bigger and

 
   

stronger one? We might be mistaken, but Independence .

Day was a movie. Other than aliens, there isn’t anyone
who we would need bigger weapons to fight.

It isn’t worth the risks to test weapomy that has
already been tested and proven to be effective. Since we
‘already know that it works, we don’t need to have two-
headed babies that look like lizards born in India, which
is one of the three countries who voted against the ban.

‘ In fact, there are only three countries which voted
against the Nuclear Test Ban Treaty: India, Libya, and
Bhutan. These" three countries are ruining things for the
rest of us. As long as there isn’t a ban on nuclear testing,
it continues. Right now, somewhere in the world, nuclear

testing is releasing harmful radiation into the air. These g

hold—outs need to get on the ball and vote in favor of the
treaty.

There is‘ nothing to be gained from nuclear testing. In
fact, testing these weapons just causes us to have to build
more. If the weapons were saved in case they were ever
needed to be used, money could be saved to help the poor
and oppressed. The money spent to test nuclear weapons
could be used to create a world in which nuclear weapon-
ry would not be necessary. We could learn to tolerate one
another, rather than practicing how to blow each other to

A letter concerning the new IDs

In the Monday, Sept. 9 issue of
The Pitt News, an editorial voiced
some concern over the issuance of
“PittCards” to all students, faculty,
and staff. I welcome the opportuni-
ty to address your concerns.

I am the director of Auxiliary
Budget and Finance and the ID
Card Center, Lynell Scaff. Since I
was asked to chair the committee
responsible for the revamping of ID
cards, the ID Center itself now
reports to the Office of Business as
an auxiliary. We were to ﬁnd a way
to make the ID Center and all its
associated costs pay for itself. In a
partnership with American Express,
we will do that over the next ﬁve
years. All costs associated with the
new IDs will be paid for, in full, by
American Express. All students
who attend the University of
Pittsburgh, regardless of their cam-
pus, will have the same universal
card to make taking classes at other
campuses and using certain ameni-
ties, such as the campus bus and
shuttle system and the library, a
breeze. '

The students, faculty, and staff
will NOT bear any of the costs of
the program, nor will they have
costs associated with the use of their
cards. All the transaction fees asso-
ciated with the program will be paid
by the merchants who accept your
“PittCard,” NOT YOU, NOT
YOUR TUITION, NOT THE
STATE, NOT THE FEDERAL
GOVERNMENT. -

Opposed to falling prey to cor-
porate America, the University of
Pittsburgh is using “Corporate
America” to help offset its expenses
and thereby  the tuition
increase Pitt students are paying.

Just check the projected tuition
increases at other universities. Pitt is
projected to_ be among the lowest
this ﬁscal year.

As for the issue of personnel: 1
did not and do not understand how
security guards and desk attendants
are a waste of University funds.
Never did we toy with the _idea of
the elimination of security payroll

‘with the _ issuance of the new

“PittCard.” Your safety and security
has no price tag. How many inci-
dents of violence and theft are pre-
vented in the dorms every year
because of conscientious security
personnel? I may never know, but I
will not save a few dollars to risk
answering that question.

As for standing in line to
receive your new “PittCard” as a
returning student, only new stu-
dents, transfer students, and new
commuting students have been
issued invitations to receive their
new cards as of yet. I fully under-
stood the ramiﬁcations of re—card-
ing a university as large and com-

. plex as ours. That is why I have

been making this information avail-
able to you with newspaper adver-
tising, letters to your homes, dorms,
and ofﬁces to inform you of your
opportunity to be recarded.

From mailers to date, I am sure
you know our conversion schedule
will last 3 1-2 months. This allows
everyone the opportunity _of being
recarded in an efficient manner.
Returning students are to be recard-
ed in three locations, the ID Center
at 107 McCormick Hall, the Pitt
Club and the lobby of Sutherland,
Monday thru Friday, Sept. 23 thru
Oct. 11, 1996. We have mailed indi-
vidual invitations by date and loca-

tion to each student to minimize any
inconvenience. In addition, I have
arranged for you to receive 10
FREE MINUTES OF LONG DIS-

TANCE CALLING TIME, just to .
say thanks for coming in. No strings .

attached.

Staff and faculty will be recard-
ed Monday thru Friday, Oct. 14-31,
1996 at the ID Center and the Pitt
Club. They, too, will receive the
phone time as out Thank You. As of
Nov. 15, 1996, all old University
IDs will no longer be accepted cam-
pus—wide. This, in fact, will save the
students money, as no unauthorized
individuals will be allowed to rent
materials from the library or ride the
PAT transit system. These are two
areas that have measurable loss
associated with unauthorized use of
these services.

The full advantages of the sys-
tem have not been made apparent to
the University community at this
time. We are in a transitional period
with full system implementation
scheduled for March of 1998. For
your convenience, we have trans-
ferred your meal plan and choice
dollar program, as well as increased
security at the residence halls,
admittance on the buses, and the
allowance of rental material at the
library. I would ask you to evaluate
the system on its merits after full
implementation. .

The “PittCard” staff and I wel-
come your ' comments and feed-
back. If any students, staff, or facul-
ty have questions, concerns or com-
ments, please feel free to call me

Government needs to get real about anti-smoking rules

 

Personally, I don’t smoke. For a long
time I went out with a girl who did smoke
and I must now resort to being cliche:
kissing her was like licking a dirty ash-
tray. She asked me once why our kisses
were so short and cold. Did I really need
to spell it out? Frankly, I think that smok-
ing is a disgusting habit. It makes you
smell bad, it makes you look bad, and in
case nobody else has noticed, that cough
just isn’t sexy. It’s a stupid habit to start in
the first place. Hey, it’s going to kill you,
slowly, with lots of suffering. What’s
cool about that? ~

Now that I’ve made enemies of
every smoker on campus, let me come to

their defense. Even though I’m one of
those insane people who likes breathing
clean air, I just can’t make heads or tails
of the political issue that smoking has
become. Can you believe this mess? The
anti-smoking lobby has gotten to be so
powerful that Bob Dole is on the verge of
losing an election because of it. How can
this be? We’re talking about cigarettes
here, not crack cocaine. Where are our
priorities? Don’t we have better things to
be spending our energy on?

Everybody knows that it isn’t good
for you. I’ve already chastised the smok-
ing public for their lack of self—concem.
But what has happened to our freedom of
personal choice? Since when does the
government have the right to tell us what

habits we can have? “Gee, Mr. Police
Officer, can I bite my nails?”

Well, Washington knows that it can’t
just barge into our lives and take away
the Winstons. So they’ve sent in the FDA
to do the dirty work. The government
isn’t trying to infringe on Constitutional
freedoms here, it’s just trying to look out
for the health and well-being of the citi-
zens it’s charged to protect. ~We’ll let
nuclear power plants crumble into the
ground so that people living nearby have
three eyes, but Heaven forbid there
should be second—hand smoke in the air!

“Let’s make nicotine a controlled
substance,” say the brains who run our
country. How are we going to do that?
Patrol the streets for it like marijuana?

Will the next generation of college stu-
dents be smoking tobacco cigarettes
instead of pot at frat parties? We could try
prescription cigarettes. If you have a seri-
ous disease and are going to die anyway,
your doctor might let you take up smok-
ing so that you can at least die happy. And
what are we going to do about all of the
people who already smoke? Are they
supposed to quit cold—turkey overnight?
No, that’s not fair. Give them a week.
Maybe the government is planning to
hand out free boxes of Nicorette gum.

Lurking behind the scenes of the
practical and ethical issues present here is
something else that demands attention.
Economics. The tobacco industry is
huge. Most of the southern states rely
heavily on growing tobacco as a cash
crop to support their economies. What
will happen to those states, and the farm-
ers who grow the tobacco, if the govem—
ment pulls this important facet of their
livelihood out from under them? A lot of
these farmers and their communities are
poor already. Tobacco is the base for their
entire local economies. Let’s just make
life worse for them.

What about Philip Morris and RJ
Reynolds, for example? The corporations
which buy the tobacco and make the cig-
arettes are enormous, with sales in the
industry at billions of dollars annually,
and employing thousands of people.
Now suppose that our wise and prudent
government restricts nicotine to con-
trolled substance status and effectively
makes smoking cigarettes illegal. The
tobacco companies are going to shut
down and all the people employed by
them will lose their jobs. Isn’t unemploy-
ment an already severe problem? Do. we
really want to intentionally make it
worse?

The sale of cigarettes adds money to
the national economy. We can spout off
economic terms all over the place here,
like Gross Domestic Product and exports.

‘ Think of how much money our economy

as a whole will lose if we shut down the
tobacco industry.

Why can’t we just leave it alone? Let
people do what they want. Only a per-
centage of the population, the minority
smoking sect, will suffer from a hands-
off attitude. They asked for it and, what’s
more, they keep the health care industry
booming.

What I can’t ﬁgure out is why
Washington cares about smoking at all.
Politicians don’t seem to mind that our
children are getting shot by drug dealers,
so why this? Vlfith as much money as
Congress gets from the tobacco lobby,
this whole idea seems like eating the
goose who lays golden eggs for

Christmas _dinner. Besides, the last time I . .

went to history class America was still
the “Land of the Free.”

efensive line blends
ouila and experience

As the Panthers entered the
1996 football season, Head Coach
Johnny. Major-s knew a tremendous
task lay ahead. Gone were seven
defensive starters, including Tom
Tumulty and Anthony Dorsett, Jr.,
to the National Football League.

Before the season started,
Majors warned the media about the
total defensive reconstruction. The
defensive line also lost starters
Mike Halapin, Tyler Young, and
Zatiti Moody.

Majors solved part of the solu-
tion when he moved l994’s leading
tackler Jason Chavis, who redshirt—
ed the 1995 season due to injuries,
to the starting position at right
defensive end.

“The toughest thing about the
transition [to right defensive end],”
said Chavis, “is that I have to read
on the run now.”

The 6-foot-2, 245—pound
McKeesport native used to start at
middle linebacker for Pitt. Through
two games at right end, he’s regis-
tered five tackles and one sack for a
minus 10 yards. .

Although his stats aren’t eye-
catching, Chavis knows that the per-
formance of a lineman doesn’t nec-
essarily reflect what is being done
for the team.

“I’m just out there to have fun

-and put pressure on the quarter-

back,” Chavis said. “If I can open
things up for the other guys, I feel
I’m doing my job.”

Chavis has been opening things
up for redshirt senior Jared Miller,
senior right tackle Mike Mohring,
and true freshman Demond Gibson.

Gibson’s play last week against
Kent State University, his first col-
legiate start, opened the eyes of the
Pitt coaching staff and his fellow
linemates.

“He had a great game,” Miller
said. “I don’t even think about
Demond being a freshman.” _

Gibson, who’s drawing compar-
isons to former Pitt great Bill Fralic,
made the most of his start against
Kent, looking comfortable chasing
down their quarterbacks and run-
ning backs. Gibson recorded two
sacks for a minus 11 yards and
recovered a fumble.

Gibson starred at defensive
tackle and on the offensive line dur-
ing his days at Penn Hills High
School, where he helped the team to
another state championship his
senior season. Fralic also attended
Penn Hills, but he anchored Pitt’s
offensive line until he graduated in
1984. The comparisons are evident,
but Gibson knows he’s got a long
way to go to reach Fralic’s athletic
accomplishments.

“It’s nice to be mentioned with
his name,” Gibson said. “But he’s

done a lot of things that I haven’t'

Prognostications from The Pitt News prognosiicator

Vince Lon o

If you subscribe to the theory that
the predictability of college football is
one of the many unique charms which
separates it from, and, some would say
(myself included), makes it superior to
professional football, you should be a
happy camper after the ﬁrst full week
of play.

With their 55-14 annihilation of
Michigan State, a mid—to-upper-level
Big Ten squad, the Nebraska

.Cornhuskers appear to be a mortal

lock for a third consecutive national
title. Although the new Big 12
Conference has now surpassed the
Southeastern Conference as the
nation’s strongest, the ‘Huskers some-
how manage to avoid both Texas and
Texas A&M -— two huge reasons why
the Big 12 is now the best — on their
1996 schedule, unless they face them
in the Big 12 title game in December.
Certainly Kansas State, Kansas,
and improved non—conference foe
Arizona State would produce at least
one loss for most programs, but
Nebraska beat these teams last year by
scores of 77-28, 49-25, and 41-3,
respectively, and I doubt that the gap
has been closed. I’m just as bored as
the next guy with Nebraska’s utter
dominance of college football, but
unless Colorado pulls an upset in

  

 

A SUITE FOR LESS

THE PITT NEWS -

Lincoln in the season’s last game, you
can pencil in the ‘Huskers for New
Orleans on Jan. 2. Perhaps Nebraska
should have hung out for one more
week in Tempe last year and taken on
the Dallas Cowboys so we could see
which football team truly was the best
in the land. In any event, onto this
week’s picks.

Auburn at Mississippi — Although
Ole Miss’ pleas of loyalty to the sons
of alums resulted in a large contingent
of quality walk-ons joining the Rebels
last February, NCAA probation and
resultant scholarship reductions will
send this already shaky program into a
tailspin. Emotion and the home field
should keep it close for a half, but 
Auburn 31, Mississippi 17.

Brigham Young at Washington -
In 1984, Robbie Bosco and BYU came
to Pitt Stadium and upset the third-
ranked Panthers 20-14 in both teams’
opening game. BYU went on to win its
ﬁrst, and only, national championship.
With an impressive victory over
mighty Texas A&M already under
their belt, the Cougars could again run
the table and challenge for the nation-
al title with a win over Washington,
their toughest remaining opponent. It
says here it won’t happen.

It’s easy to say that this
week’s game against the
Houston Cougars is the make
or break game for the Panthers’

season. So, I’m going to say it..

If Pitt wins this game they
could manage a decent season

and leave the home fans with a ’

sense of hope for the rest of
their lives.

If not, the Panthers could
fall into oblivion and the search
for a new head coach should
begin now because I don’t think
Johnny Majors can take any
more of this misery. And nei-
ther can the thousands of Pitt
fans and alumni. But until the
ﬁnal gun sounds and the score
goes down in the books, let’s
take a look at how these two
teams match up on the ﬁeld and
off. Because we all know that
there are olf-the-ﬁeld intangi-
bles that do actually change the
course of the game as we know
it, week in and week out.

Last week, Pitt destroyed
Kent 52-14 in front of about
20,000 wet, armoyed fans at Pitt
Stadium. Following the game,
Majors said that Kent was just a
bad team and that they should
have beat them in the ﬁrst place.
Face it, the team that showed up
to play the Panthers last week
looked like a Pop Warner team
on crack. Even Big Dick
Bender couldn’t hang with the
Panthers as the Golden Flash
ﬂickered out. They stunk up
Oakland something ﬁerce with
their lousy defense and horren-
dous offense. Not to take any-
thing away from a win that
undoubtedly lifted the
Panthers’ plummeting morale,
but in my mind that game does-
n’t count. Right now, Pitt is still
0-1 and they are coming into a
game that will be tougher than
many people think.

Last week Houston faced
then—No. 17 LSU and the
Cougars gave the Tigers all they
could handle before ﬁnally
falling 35-34. Houston is for
real, and I’m not talking about
the boys of Phi Slamrna Jarnma
of the early ‘80s or the unthink-
able air attack of the late ‘80s
led by Heisman winner Andre
Ware and the early ‘90s headed

Tech, in the Astrodome.

Both teams enter the game
1-1, even though Pitt did play
Kent, and the Panthers are
favored by four. Let’s take a
look at some of the on-ﬁeld
matchups.

Quarterback- Matt Lytle
vs. Chuck Clements

Lytle struggled in the open-
er against West Virginia as he
was sacked eight times and
managed only 68 yards pass-
ing. He bounced back against
the Little Girls of the Holy
Grail last week with 125 yards
on 12-25 passing and threw 2
TDs in his three quarters of
action.

Clements hasn’t been as
potent as some of his QB pre-

the Cougars, Antowain Smith
and Ketrick Sanford have put
up impressive numbers in the

past, but haven’t really got on

track yet this season. Look for
Pitt to run big against a defense
that gave up a school-record

246 yards rushing last week to
LSU’s Kevin Faulk.
Advantage: Pitt

Wide Receiver- Curtis
Anderson vs. Damion Johnson

Anderson has struggled so
far in ‘96 with only four catch-
es for 49 yards, but he did make
his way into the end zone last
week against the wussies from
Kent. His kickoff returns have
been solid, but the Panthers
probably hope they aren’t
returning many kickolfs.

Johnson caught 31 passes a

Fancy names won't help Cougars this time

year ago for 377 yards and
three TDs. Last week, he
hauled in 10 balls for 114 yards.
This could be a toss up, so I had
to go into the vault of pointless
information to pick my favorite.
Anderson is 6-foot-1, 190
pounds and Johnson is 6-foot—l,
186 pounds. Still no edge. Both
are seniors, no experience
advantage.

Got it, Anderson is major-
ing in legal studies while
Johnson is focusing on kinesi—
ology, the study of how your
muscles work. No question
about it now, Johnson gets the
nod for having the future salary
advantage. Sorry, money is
important. Advantage:
Houston

Neither defense is good
enough to talk about, even
though the Panthers only
allowed 138 yards of total
olfense to Kent. Then. again, the
Pitt women’s soccer team could
score against the Kent defense.

Thou shalt not waste your
time or mine with ﬁivolous
babble about the defenses any-
way because nobody really
cares at this point, huh?! So I’ve
gone into the world of bigger
and better things. You guessed
it, the weekly edition of every-
one’s favorite space ﬁller, The
Name Game.

The Cougars are stacked.

. They bring into town the likes

of nmning back Aaron Bluitt,
safety DeKeithron Callicoattee,
guard Corky Chadwell and
Josh Lovelady. But the main
stud for Houston is 5-foot-10,

yll/likg Kovak

According to ESPN and several
other publications, the University of
Houston Cougar football program is on
the rise. They are a team to look out for.
Don’t assume anything against this new
Cougar outﬁt.

Just ask Louisiana State University.
They needed a 21-point fourth quarter
rally to narrowly eclipse these Cougars
35-34 at Tiger Stadium last week.

Houston’s defense created ﬁve
turnovers in that contest, but they also
surrendered 601 yards of total offense.
LSU’s Kevin Faulk, Marshall’s cousin,
exploded for a school—record 246 yards
rushing against the Cougars.

Houston is in a similar position to
Pitt. They, too, formerly boasted of a
lofty athletic reputation, culminating
when Andre Ware won the Heisman
Trophy in 1989. They have fallen a long
way, but are in the process of rebuilding.

Coach Kim Helton’s 1996 team is
deeper than any other Cougar team in
recent memory. They boast of an out-
standing backﬁeld. First, there’s quarter-
back Chuck Clements. He’s the 19th
ranked passer in the NCAA going 42 of
61 _ (68.8 percent) for 436 yards and ﬁve

 

touchdowns.

Like Pitt’s tailback combination of
Billy West and Dwayne Schulters,
Houston can throw two solid runners at a
defense. Ketric Sanford leads the team
with 202 yards rushing and a 7.0 yards
per carry average. Sanford is also dan-
gerous on kickoff returns, where he cur-
rently ranks sixth in the NCAA (right
behind Pitt’s Curtis Anderson) with a
30.67 average. Antowain Smith has

gained 188 yards and scored three touch- -

downs.

Clements’ main target is wide
receiver Damion Johnson. Johnson’s
hauled in 10 receptions for 114 yards and
two touchdowns. The Cougars appear
loaded at the skill positions but they have
dropped 12 straight non-conference road
games since Ware engineered a 36-7
thumping of Arizona State in 1989.

Houston’s defense deﬁnes the term
“weak link.” They do return leading tack-
ler Mike Parker (107 total tackles, seven
tackles for losses, two sacks) and comer-
back _Thornathan Good, who lead the
team with seven passes broken up.

A few Cougar newcomers to watch
out for on Saturday include offensive
tackle Ryan Hendrickson, their top new-
comer, defensive back Devon Pender and
defensive lineman Antoine Simpson.

The Pitt football team was hand-
ed a shocking surprise this week.
But this type of surprise won’t help
a Panther team looking for their
first winning season in seven years.

Earlier this week, sophomore
Demetrius Harris quit the team for
unexplained reasons. Harris, a
sophomore, was Pitt’s leading rush-
er last year, gaining 610 yards in
137 attempts as a true freshman.
Harris reached "paydirt five times
last season.

Harris surged into the spotlight
in 1995 following Billy West’s
shoulder and leg injuries. Harris
electrified the Panther offense last
season beginning with the second
game of the year versus Eastern
Michigan" in which he had a 55-yard
touchdown run to go along with two
other touchdowns.

Harris also had a 135-yard rush-
ing performance against Rutgers
University later in the season.

But with Billy West returning
this year, as well as the emergence
of junior college transfer Dwayne

Schulters, the Panther coaches
decided to move Harris to wide
receiver ‘this spring. Harris was
reportedly unhappy with the move
and after an unimpressive spring,
the coaches decided to move him

- again, this time to defensive back.

The coaches hoped that defen-
sive back would be an ideal position
for Harris because he could show-
case his 4.48 40-yard dash speed as
well as bolster a relatively thin and
inexperienced secondary. 9 ‘

But Harris wanted to remain on
the offense, where he led the
Panthers with two 100-yard games
lastiseason. Harris had an unspec-
tacular mini—camp at defensive back
and was plagued with minor shoul-
der and groin injuries. Because of
these factors, Harris was penciled in
on the second—team defense.

Contrasted with last season, in
which he played 11 games in all,
Harris did not play in, or even show
up for, Pitt’s second game of the
season against Kent State

.University.

Harris played briefly during the
fourth quarter in Pitt’s season-open-

Going into this season,

Magazine named him one of the producers since Majors returned records. The team broke 28

top 100 high school players in
the country last year. The
National Recruiting Advisor and
Street and Smith's loved his
game as well. _

Gibson was heavily recruited
out of high school and bucked
recent local trends by choosing
Pitt. Gibson narrowed his choic-
es to Pitt, Penn State and Ohio
State. His chances at cracking
the lineups at PSU or OSU in the
next two years were not good.
Gibson knew he could impact
Pitt’s defense earlier this
year

“I thought I could help make
a difference here, better than at
Ohio State or somewhere where
I would just sit out forever,”
Gibson said.

Against the Houston
Cougars, who run a pass-orient-
ed offense, Gibson won’t sit and
hopes to improve on his team-

to Pitt in 1993. Originally, after
redshirting his freshman year,
Miller started seven games at
right guard in place of Lamont
Liggett, who suffered a sprained
ankle.

Last season, Miller started
the first eight games of the year
before giving way to Mohring.
H e '

records during the off-season.

With a new found attitude,
an incredible freshman prospect
and ‘more experience than any
other defensive group, Pitt’s
defensive line looks to propel
Pitt into the present and, with
Gibson, provides a bright look at
the future.

THE PITT NEWS

Thursday, September I 2, ‘I996

 

Half of Division I-A olhlelic departments

lose money, according lo NCAA figures
Average deficit is $174,000; Pitt's may be much larger; according to report

 

Last year, the University of
Pittsburgh underwent a comprehen-
sive review which culminated in what
is now commonly called “The Fisher
Report.” One of the problems
that was uncovered in the review was
the low moral surrounding the
University ofPittsburgh’s intercolle-
giate athletic programs, and particu-
larly the football program.

The Fisher Report consisted of
interviews with students, faculty,
staﬁﬂ, and trustees. One interviewee,
identified as “a senior faculty mem-
ber” from Pitt is quoted as saying
“When we were national champions,
we still couldn ’t fill the stadium.”

Pitt is not alone in its troubles
with a football program. The enemy
we face this weekend has its own
problems on the home front. In the
following excerpt from The
Chronicle of Higher Education from
September 13, the difficulties of the
Houston Cougars Football program
are brought to light.

   

In a state where a university’s
reputation can rise and fall with the
fortunes of its football team, elimi-
nating an entire athletics program is
almost unthinkable. But the
University of Houston is actually
considering that worse—case scenario
as it struggles to staunch the ﬂow of
red ink in its athletic budget.

In doing so, officials at Houston
are re-examining basic assumptions
about the role that intercollegiate
sports play in bringing students —
and prestige — to a university. The
outcome could be a stronger athletics
program that carries its weight finan-
cially. Or it could mean drastic cuts
in a program that over the years has
soared as high as its most famous
alumni — Hakeem Olajuwon and
Carl Lewis —-— and sunk as low as its
scandal-ridden football program of
the late 1980s and early 1990s. 

The athletics deficit for fiscal
year 1995 was approximately $5 mil-
lion, and the expected shortfall for
fiscal 1996 is $4.4 million — more

than one-third of the program’s $13
million budget. The shortfall would
be even higher were it not for the $2
million in fees that students chip in
each year. .

“Most of the faculty is just thor-
oughly fed up with the deficit,” says
Janet Chafetz, a professor of sociol-
ogy. “We could be applying this
money toward hiring more faculty,
supporting graduate assistantships,
or improving library resources —
things that have been sliding for a
long time.”

But University officials won’t
call it quits so easily. The deficit,
they say, while unacceptable, still
represents a ‘tiny fraction of the uni-
versity’s $365 million budget. And
despite complaints that there is little
enthusiasm for sports among stu-
dents or faculty members, adminis-
trators here believe that an‘ athletic
program still has the potential to
bring the community together.

“In some ways, having a strong
intercollegiate athletic program is
even more important for a commut-

- Norton Antivlrus and more

ing campus than a traditional resi-
dential campus,” says Glenn A.
Goerke, the University’s president.
“It’s something we can do as a fami-
ly. It can potentially be some of the
glue that holds us together.”

The University of Houston is not
alone in its struggles to keep up with
the mounting costs of competing in
big-time sports. According to the
National Collegiate Athletic
Association, about half of all
Division I—A athletic departments
lose money.

The problem is particularly acute
in Texas, where all 23 public col-
leges lose money on athletics. That
includes Southwest Texas State
University, which operates its athlet-
ic department at a $3.4 million
deficit, and Stephen F. Austin lost $3
million last year.

Despite those successes, the ath-
letics department has been plagued
by problems. Among them:

Harris
ing loss to West Virginia.

The news of Harris’ departure
leaked following the Kent game.

“He’s gone,” Panthers’ Coach
Johnny Majors said. “He has decid-
ed to give up football. I don’t want
to elaborate any further.”

Majors said that Harris’ schol-
arship will be honored for the
remainder of this semester, but he is
free to accept a transfer. Harris has
two years of eligibility remaining.

Harris is the second impact
player to leave the team this year
following the dismissal of corner-
back Denorse Mosley for violating
team rules.

This autonomy on the part of the
athletic departments "was attributed
to unnamed trustees who want to
keep the department’s records
closed. The report did postulate,
however; that the “priority revenue

annual deficit of $3 to $4 million and

that this may be a chronic condition. _

Wa ans dra s Sandler along for another million

dol ars in Bu letproof.

A Bulletproof scheme for
raking in Ihe big bucks

Bulletproof

Starring Damon Wayans and
Adam Sandler

Directed by Ernest Dickerson

Many ideas and themes are
copied from one movie to anoth-
er. A great example of this is the
familiar Die Hard -type story-
line. You know that old standby:
terrorists kidnap hostages and
it’s up to one lone, heroic man to
save them, etc. It appeared in
every kind of movie location
imaginable: a skyscraper, an air-
port, an arena, and most recent-
ly, in the case of the movie
presently being made down-
town called Desperate
Measures starring hometown
boy Michael Keaton, in a hospi-
tal.

My point is that many times
viewers are tired of seeing a
recurring theme. This is NOT
the case with Bulletproof Many
may say it resembles the come-
dy Midnight Run. True, all the
signs are there. They are both
about a tough cop and a hostile
witness. The difference is that
Bulletproofs similarity with
Midnight Run does not prevent
it from being a thoroughly
enjoyable ﬁlm in its own right.

In Bulletproof Wayans

plays Jack Carter, an undercover
cop who is assigned to watch
Archy Moses (Sandler). They
steal cars togetherand play pool,
all the things good friends do
together. After gaining Archy’s
trust, Jack gets him to confess he
is dealing drugs with Coleton, a
high—powered drug lord played
by James Caan. After getting the
info he needs, Jack sets up the
bust, which goes sour. In his
attempts to apprehend Archy,
Jack is accidentally shot by him.
Now Coleton and the mob are
after Archy for bringing a cop
into their operation. Archy
decides to give up Coleton and
the mob in return for protection.
The only term is that he wants to
be arrested by Jack. After he
picks him up, the fun begins.
Especially since he is still bitter
about being shot.

The movie is very impres-
sive. Both Adam Sandler’s and
Damon Wayans’ last pictures

A were funny, but had no real edu-

cated theme. Bulletproof, how-
ever, has both. Not only is it
hilarious, but it also had a few
ironic twists. If you liked
Midnight Run, you’ll love
Bulletprooﬁ

I O; The bathrooms. Granted, 
the fact that the place attracts a bunch 
of alcoholic slobs who can’t piss
straight is hardly their fault, so we’ll
just progress on to all the real reasons
not to go to this Hall of Greed.

6.. The Yellow-Shirted, Dickhead Bouncers.
Anyone, who after dropping between $20.50 to $60 for a

ticket, tries to enter the Sacred Star Lake Sanctum, must be ﬁisked
by these Hitler Youth—type goons. Now, I know that these boys are

b tards.
5 o The bands themselves. The fact
that I can count on one hand the num~
ber of times I’ve been suckered
into going to Star Lake indicates
the number of cool bands who
play arena rock in the ‘90s.

1 o Ticketmaster. While I am by no means a big Pearl
Jam fan, anyone with half a brain (or, like me, half a wal-
let) has to appreciate their (at least symbolic) stand against
this greedy corporate entity. Any time anyone can buy a
concert ticket at the actual venue without paying the ser-
vice charge at NRM, do it. You don’t need
me to tell you how much better it feels when
you pay $8, as opposed to $12, for an $8
show.

4 o T-Shirt Prices. Of course,
this ain’t Star Iake’s fault, but all
these elements of corporate
greed go hand—in—hand.

8 0 Too many ugly white people. As
a rule, I avoid shopping malls for pretty
much the same reason. At the Neil Young
show, some asshole was wearing a t—shirt
(no doubt bought at the mall) that said
“Silly Faggot, Dicks Are For Chic 
His girlfriend had a matching brain on.

7 o Star Lake tralﬁc. Sure, get-
ting loaded in the car on the way to
a show is half the fun (especially
when you’ve got the aforemen-
tioned pricey beers to look for-
ward to), but the drive out to Star
Lake isn’t fun for anyone. I would
much rather drive to the
Nyabinghi Club in West Virginia
to support a great venue who real-
ly respects and appreciates their

3 o Lawn seats. Sure,
everyone loves to kick
back in the grass, but did
anyone ever notice the fact
 that the music (especially the opening
 bands, whose sound is always turned
 up only half as loud as the headliners)
 just doesn’t sound as good half a mile
3 away from the stage? Besides that,

there is also the fact that you aren’t

allowed to bring a lawn chair into the

As all self-respecting film hogs
know, the Carnegie Museum of Art con-
sistently programs with the best of them
other MOAs. It’s people like us who
know a good MOA program when we
see one; we’re people who simply won’t
miss Kenneth Anger’s upcoming
appearance at the Warhol (Sept. 26, read
all about it in an upcoming Spectrum),
and we’re the ones who watch Oliver
Stone films only to make fun of the
hammerhead. Oink Oink!

So while we have seen some
films of the MOA’s current series,
“Landmarks of Film,” a few still remain
unwatched. The three—month long pro-
gram lives up to its grandiose title with
screenings of Battleship Potemkin,
Birth of a Nation, The Cabinet of Dr.
Caligari, The Jazz Singer(not Neil
Diamond’s!), Citizen Kane, and a cou-
ple others that I think have written about
somewhere else.

Not related to the “Landmarks of
Film” program is the Carnegie’s one-
time only screening of The Typewriter,
the Riﬂe, and the Movie Camera. Less
ubiquitous than “Landmarks,” but no
less influential, is the director Mr.
Samuel Fuller. As Adam Simon’s por-
trait of Fuller will demonstrate, the man
is the would-be headliner for a direc-
tors’ choice film series of underappreci-
ated filmmakers. A viewing of Fuller’s
now-classic crime story Underworld,
USA (1960) will have you convinced

   

Scorsese and Tarantino watched this
artifact more than a few times. The
Typewriter, the Rifle, and the Movie
Camera is an hour—long film with clips
from Fuller’s films, as Tim Robbins
interviews Fuller and directors
Jarmusch, Tarantino and Scorsese who
speak about Fuller’s influence on their
work. Don’t miss this: Wednesday,
Sept 25, 8 pm.

Also of necessary mention are
the programs of the film and video
gallery. Tunic (Song for Karen) and
Kepone , two video pieces by Tony
Oursler, run through Oct. 20. These two
tapes, one a Sonic Youth video, trans-
form a black -box studio space into
Oursler’s own personal backyard. In the
film gallery, Paul Sharits’ Color Sound
Frame will continue to run through Oct.
6. As the Carnegie’s Film and Video
guide states: “Part movie, part painting,
and part structural enterprise, this film
is engagingly obsessive and gloriously
transcendent.” ’

The dates and times for the
Landmarks of Film program are as fol-
lows:

. +Birth of a Nation (D. W.
Griffith, 1915): Sunday, Sept.l5, 7 pm.
+The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari
(Robert Weine, 1919): Sunday, Sept. 22,

John Cihon’s Handy Guide to Iron City PUNK ROCK

Pittsburgh has a great
punk/hardcore scene, with lots of
nationally known bands calling
this city their home. In fact, a lot
of these, bands are a bigger draw
outside the city than in it. If all
you’ve seen is the so-called ‘punk’
that gets played on MTV these
days, you owe it to yourself to
check these bands out.

The BAD GENES (PO Box
71275, Pgh, PA 15213,
http://info.pitt.edu/~seanw/genes.
html) got back together, recorded
a CD that should be out soon,
played a few shows, and are now
on hiatus until fall. AUS-ROT-
TEN (PO Box 71287) released
their excellent album of crusty
metallic anarchopunk,‘ The System
Works... For Them, on Tribal War
Records to good reviews. THE
MODAL CITIZENS, Operation
Ivy—tinged punk, played a lot of
shows in a short period of time,
opened for Rancid, and broke up
soon afterwards. The remaining
members are searching for a drum-
mer. ANTI-FLAG (PO BOX
7 1 2 6 6 ,

replaced him to go on an extended
US tour, and they have a CD com-
ing out in September.

THE MOLLIES sound

vaguely like the Dead Kennedys
musically, and have been playing
some shows around town. SUB-
MACHINE (C.I. Records, 739
Manor St., Lancaster, PA 17603)
are stil_l around, playing their
drunken hardcore, but they hardly
ever play all ages shows in town
anymore. The same goes for
WORMHOLE (Ripe Records,
1739 East Carson St. #250, Pgh,
PA 15203), although Ripe Records
is rumored to be putting out an
Iron City Punk II CD compilation
sometime soon.

Iron City Punk is the
excellent CD that got the
Pittsburgh scene noticed a couple
years back, and went out of print
almost immediately after coming
out. DISCO CRISIS has Andy
(formerly of Anti—Flag) playing
drums. They play straight ahead
punk with screechy female vocals,
courtesy of Sabrina.

REAGAN SQUAD are all
still in high school, and play
excellent melodic hardcore.
Expect to hear a lot about them
soon. Fifty-seven DEFECTIVE
(PO BOX 101843, Pgh 15237)
used to be called The Loveless,
and play basic pop punk. DAVEN-
PORT (5650 Forbes Ave. #5, Pgh,
15217) have a couple singles and a
12” out, and play complex noisy

hardcore. CREEPS play noisy
drunk punk, and have set up a cou-
ple basement shows for out—of-
town bands in the past. THE
KEBOBS (19 Marion Ave, #2,
Pgh 15221) play old style punk
with a heavy Oi inﬂuence. NEGA-
TIVE OUTLOOK (PO box
71024, Pgh 15213) play metallic
hardcore with \double female
vocals. They have a single coming
out on Aus Rotten’s Rotten
Propaganda Records.
DISCHORD (571 Main St., North
Huntington, PA 15642) sound like
what you’d expect from a band
with the infamous
(metallic, w/lyrics about war and
cops), but they play the style pret-
-ty well. They also have a single
out on Rotten Propaganda.

THE SUSSED have a CD
available and play highly singable
old school Oi/punk. And lastly,
THE WITCH BABIES (PO Box
71247, e-mail: jjcst25@pitt.edu,
http://www.pitt.edu/~jjcst25/),
play garage style punk and have a
demo available. They also have
been setting up shows for out of
town bands. Send a demo and get
in touch if you’re interested. Any
additions, questions or comments,

“Undaunted Courage: Meriwether
Lewis, Thomas Jefferson, and the
Opening of the American West”
Written By Stephen Ambrose

Was Meriwether Lewis a manic
depressive? What was the real politi-
cal philosophy of Thomas Jefferson?
Did he practice what he preached?
Why was there a Whiskey Rebellion?
What was it like to be in the ﬂedg-
ling U.S. Army in the last decade of
the 18th Century?

With less than four years to go
before the 21st century, it is particu-
larly important to know the answers

‘to these questions, however unpleas-

ant some of them may be. Honest
answers can be found in Stephen
Ambrose’s “Undaunted Courage:
Meriwether Lewis, Thomas
Jefferson, and the Opening of the
American West.”

“Undaunted Courage” is a biog-
raphy, an adventure story, a social
critique, and a psychological profile
all in one. Factually, it is an account
of the 1804-1806 exploration of the
Louisiana Purchase by Meriwether
Lewis and William Clark. It is also a
critique of Thomas Jefferson, and it
provides a picture of life in the
United States in the first decade of
the 19th century.

The story begins on the verso
page (facing the table of contents),

THE prrr NEWS_

where the reader is met with
Jefferson’s opinion of Meriwether
Lewis: “Of courage undaunted, pos-
sessing a firmness and perseverance
of purpose from which nothing but
impossibilities could divert from its
direction ....I could have no hesita-
tion in confiding the enterprise _to
him.”

The relationship between
Jefferson and Lewis was very close,
not unlike that of a father and son.
Ambrose’s examination of this rela-
tionship makes for fascinating read-
ing. ‘A

However, the main theme of the
book and, I believe, the purpose for
which it was written,_is the criticism
of Lewis and Jefferson — Lewis in
particular and American westward
expansion in general. While much of
the criticism of Lewis (and Clark)
and some of the criticism of
Jefferson is valid, some of it is
ridiculous. It is undeniable that
Lewis and Clark were “high and
mighty” in their dealings with Native
Americans. Ambrose cites more than
a few examples of this attitude.

That which comes immediately
to mind is the encounter with the
Teton Sioux in September 1804.
Lewis was under orders from
Jefferson to establish good relations
with the Sioux, and to “exercise
restraint.” But he made a big issue of

a few carats of tobacco, because he
was unwilling to acknowledge the
right of the Sioux to demand a toll of
white river travellers. So he lost his
opportunity to establish relations
with the Sioux. What would have
been the problem with paying a small
toll to the Sioux?

On the other hand, Ambrose
exposes his own negative attitude
toward commercial enterprise and
American expansion in several
places. There is a passage (pg. 406)
which relates that the captains of the
trip held a public auction and sold
items used on the voyage. Ambrose
calls this a “dreadful disgrace.” Give
me a break. Why was this a “dreadful
disgrace?” A mistake possibly, but
certainly not a “dreadful disgrace.”

Ambrose also refers to
Jefferson’s policy toward Native
Americans as cynical, and refers to
American "expansion as “the mad
rush West.” Perhaps it was cynical,
since Jefferson advocated controlling
the Indians through commerce.
However, this certainly was a better

' policy than those of his successors.

(The example of the removal of the
Cherokees to Oklahoma comes to
mind...) And what of this “mad rush
West?” The territory west of the
Mississippi River was not settled in
any numbers until the 1830s and
later, a full 30 years after the expedi-

 

tion. Is Ambrose implying that there
should have been no westward
expansion? Also, he doesn’t offer
any solution as to how he would have
handled Native Americans had he
been in Jefferson’s place.

Ambrose’s theory that Lewis was
a manic depressive is interesting, and
probably true, as Ambrose points out
that “hypochondriac afﬂictions” ran
in Lewis’ family. Certainly, a depres-
sive reaction explains some of
Lewis’ puzzling behavior, such as his
failure to publish the journals of ‘his
expedition, and his suicide. Also,
Lewis’ proﬂigate and irresponsible
habit of charging his debts to the fed-
eral government certainly may be
evidence of manic behavior.
However, in spite of all the criticism
of Lewis, there is no doubt that
Ambrose is very much in favor of
him, as a leader and as an army offi-
cer.

There are many places in the
book where Ambrose criticizes
Lewis’ thoughts and behavior. While
some of the criticism is a touch
overblown, “Undaunted Courage”
makes for interesting and enjoyable
reading. It is a must for anyone seri-
ously interested in that period of our
history, and for anyone interested in
the American West.

The Reverend Horton Heat
It’s Martini Time
Interscope

Raw energy. That’s what The
Reverend Horton Heat is all about.

It’: Martini Time, the second
major—label release by the band that
coined the term “psychobilly,” is an
all—out festival of hard beating drums,
grinding guitar riffs, and subtle humor
that made the Reverend a household
name. Well, maybe they are just a
household name in some very strange
households (“Junior, go to your room
and don’t come out till you’ve heard
some psychobillyl”).

THE PI'I'I' NEWS

For those of you who haven’t
been enlightened, The Reverend
Horton Heat does not work alone. The
band is actually made up of
singer/guitarist the Rev (sometimes
known as Jim Heath), stand—up bassist
Jimbo, and drummer Scott Churilla.
They specialize in their own unique
blend of rockabilly, punk, and
straightforward rock, with a bit of
country—twanged guitar thrown in for
good measure.

The band rocks out with some
great tunes right from the beginning
of the disc, especially with the first
two tracks, “Big Red Rocket of Love”
and the ironicallyetitled “S1ow” (it’s

actually very fast). Both these songs
showcase the pounding drums and
slappy bass lines that The Reverend
Horton Heat made its name on.

After that, the band continues to
churn out more great tunes that just
make you want to get up and mosh
with your roommate. Heavy reverb is
the hymn of the day on the rockabilly
and ultra—lounge influenced title-
track. “Generation Why” takes a hard-
edged, satirical look at the current
“hip” generation.

It doesn’t end there, though. On
his Martini Time, the Rev also inves-
tigates such interesting topics as the
ways of fixing a broken cigarette and

 
 
   

the sexual behavior of cowboys. Yes,

4 you heard right. “Crooked Cigarette”

is a how—to guide to fixing a cigarette
when it is broken near its filter, while
the country—inﬂuenced “Cowboy
Love” examines life at a gay cowboy
bar (one of Jimbo’s actual — and acci-
dental, he adds — experiences) with
humorous, playful lyrics.

Most of the Rev’s sermons dis-
cuss the well—known rock standbys:
liquor, women, and fast automobiles.
Yet, a band that’s not afraid to sing
about “an interracial—cowboy—homo
kind of love,’’ definitely gets points
for originality, if not political correct-

ness. “It’s just a song about love,”
says the Reverend.

Still, I’d like to see Eddie Vedder
and Pearl Jam attempt to tackle that
one. It would probably make the
garbage they’re putting out now seem
reasonable. But I digress...

It is songs like these that make Its
Martini Time such a great change of
pace from the overall whine—and—
angst fest that is the trend in most of
today’s more popular “alternative”
tunes. The Reverend Horton Heat still
plays great, rocking music, but the

All the Nation ’s Airports
Alias/Elektra

The Archers of Loaf seem to
have an uncanny knack for picking
current—events record titles. First it
was Mad Cow Disease and their
album The Speed of Cattle, released
in April 1996. With commercial air-
liners falling out of the sky in July,
it took the speedy Loaf only about a
month to release All the Nation’s
Airports, eerily preceded by the
“Vocal Shrapnel” 7”, featuring in-
flight safety instructions as the
cover art.

terrorist scum” pick up on the “Let
the Loser Melt” nastiness theme
from Vee Vee. There are also some
nice slidey guitar riffs layered over
their equally-characteristic wall of
guitars.

“Vocal Shrapnel” also rocks out
with a nicely restrained verse that
opens up into a full—throttle trebly
and feedback—rich refrain, complete
with eerie pitchbends. “Bones of
Her Hands” is a minor—feeling,
straight—ahead, fast—paced song in
fine Chapel Hill style. Slower, but
still typical Loaf, is “Assassination
on Xmas Eve.” Layering a strange,
shrieky guitar tone and a methodi-
cally—repeated melody with a trebly
chord wall, the song builds" to a
deliciously slow burn.

But songs like “Chumming the
Ocean” demonstrate their new,
more reflective sound. Using only
piano and Johnson’s tortured and
crackly voice, the song is as basic
as it gets. It’s also depressing as
hell. Mike Kovak said “I wouldn’t
want to be on a window ledge”
while it was playing.

Continuing on the draggy and
depressing tip, “Acromegaly” stays
slow and low for its duration, while
“Distance Comes in Droves” is a
brooding four-plus minutes, broken
up by hard guitar and drum hits.
