Governor’s New Budget
Threatens Tuition Hike

Of $100 in September

(See editorial, “A Look Toward The Future,” Page 4)
Governor Raymond P. Shafer’s new state budget threatens
the University with a. $100 increase in tuition.
The governor submitted his $1.981 billion budget Wednesday

It is scheduled to start July 1.

The University, Penn State, and Temple received a total $122.’:
million, an increase of $19 million, compared to the $33 million

extra the schools asked.

Governor Sharer stated that this was all that was available,
-but if the universities needed more money they could increase tui-
tion $10O a year. The raise would include n-ot only the University
and the other two state-‘related schools, but also the 13 state col
leges and Indiana University of Pennsylvania.

He alloted $11 million extra for the state colleges and $1
million more for state-related schools. The state colleges -and state
related institutions have a total student body ‘of approximate!)
108,000 during the 1968-69 ﬁscal year. A tuition raise of $100 woulc
therefore give them $10.8 million. _

The budget includes no new taxes, but it is ﬁnanced from taxe:

Chaplain Sponsored Series

Zahn Rejects Current Draft System

by BARBARA MARKOWITZ

“It is better that a hundred
cowards ﬁnd escape from the
draft through consciencious ob-
jection than one sincere paciﬁst
be denied the exercise of his
rights,” stated Dr. Gordon C.
Zahn, professor of sociology at
the University of Massachusetts.
His lecture Tuesday in the SU
Ballroom, “War, Conscience, and
Dissent,” is the ﬁrst in the Pit-
cairn Crabbe series sponsored
by the University Chaplains‘ As-
sociation.

Dr. Zahn stated that the sub-
ject of consciencious objection

Micro Department Holds
Undergraduate Coffee Hour

The Department of Biophysics
and Microbiology has recently
been merged from the separate
dep-artments of biophysics and
microbiology. It is a new under-

graduate program which can

function as a non-specialized pro-
gram for broad education or as
a specialized program for hon-
ors students.

In order to acquaint under-
graduates with program require-
ments before registration for
the new term begins, the de-
partment is holding an open
house and coffee hour Monday
in the Lowy Room, Clapp Hall.
from 2-5 p.m. Graduate students
and faculty members will be
available for consultations, and
tours will be conducted through

the laboratories and department .

facilities. Dr. E. A. Pratt is the
undergraduate advisor.

The major in biophysics and
microbiology is inteded to pro-
vide a background in the phy-
sical, chemical, and biological
sciences and to prepare students
for advanced study in biophys-
ics, microbiology, biochem-istry,
or biology.

The new department can ful-
ﬁll requirements for medical
school as well as graduate school
in the life sciences.

Dr. Chein Ho, associate pro-
fessor of biophysics and micro-
biology at the University, stated
that the new program can also
be preparation for medical tech-
nology, biomedical research, and
private industry. He said that
independent research will be en-
couraged in the areas of the
life sciences.

The curriculum consists of
core courses to be taken by all
students and separate supple-
mentary courses to be taken for
the degree of bachelor of sci-
ence of bachelor of science with
honors. _

Actively concerned with how
living things work, the depart-
ment does research in viruses,
nucleic acids (DNA and RNA),
electron microscopy, proteins,
and chemical genetics. Through
research, it attempts to explain
living processes in terms of phy-
sics and chemistry. It is hoped
that new understanding will be
gained that would not be obtain-
ed with the departments work-
ing separately.

The department stresses that
previonus biochemical and phy-
sics majors are able to transfer
to the new program, since activ-
ities are interdisciplinary in na-

‘z5___ture.

is becoming harder to speak on
because his audiences are no
longer adverse to his position
and because he presents no new
arguments to them. He deﬁned
his position as that of a “rela-
tive paciﬁst close to an absolute
position” since he is opposed to
“modern war in general, Viet-
nam in particular.”

He said that if he were of
draft age, he would openly re-
sist, and that he tries to give
support to the resistance move-
ment and consciencious objec-
tion. The fact that his views are
no longer considered “on the
very of heresy’ indicates to him
that “opinion has moved toward
greater openness on the sub-
ject.”

Each individual faces both a
crisis of conscience and a crisis
of understanding concerning
war, according to Dr. Zahn. The
crisis of conscience occurs when
the individual fails to reconcile
a war with his personal, moral,

or ethical beliefs. If the individ-
ual resolves his crisis of con-
science by going against nation-
al policy, he faces a crisis of
understanding‘ which involves
gaining respect from those who
don't agree with his position.

Dr. Zahn feels that external
coercion forcing an individual to
act against his beliefes is “an
abuse of authority.” He said that
“atuhority, although it doesn’t
demand inward acceptance of
values is satisﬁed with conform-

already on the books. The great
er part of the monies will go ta
public instruction, which is re
ceiving $1 billion, an in-crease c
$179.8 million.

The governor said that bi
budget is priorities-has-ed. H
hopes it will end the “ﬁscal cri-s
is” that has been plaguing Penr
sylvania. “If our present rex
enue structure cannot provide
the money needed, then we mus
either change the structure 126

priorities to the mo-ney avai
able.”

He terms his plans a “trutl

payers. “It will help us to di.
tinguish that which may be d(
sirable an-d that which is esser

Editorial: A Look Toward the Future

The possibility of a tuition increase has been renewed, as stated
in Governor Raymond P. Shafer’s Budget Address Wednesday to the
State Legislature. We can understand the rationale behind his logic, as
the money allotted to the state-related universities is a sizeable figure.
What we cannot accept is the short-sightedness of a State Legislature
that makes a serious committment that it just might not be able to keep.

During the course of our interviews with various state officials,
both elected and appointed, we learned that although the initial decision

0 was to lower our tuition to $450 a year, this was perhaps infeasible in

the long run, in View of the priorities of the State. Although an increase
of $100 is not so drastic, we wonder if‘ this might be only the beginning.
We remember that in the midst of the legislative stalemate late last
year there was talk of doubling our tuition. In early January, the Gov-
ernor told us the would not rule out a possible tuition hike. His budget
address indicates that if he wants to maintain a budget slowly below $2
billion, he has no recourse but to consider raising the tuition fee at the
three state-related universities, and thus deny them of a good percentage
of their requests.

Obviously, we cannot be up in arms over the Governor’s hint of a
tuition increase, but we cannot ignore that the implications in his state-
ment could hold far more than an increase of $100. Our research. con-
cerning the legislative stalemate last term revealed that many ‘officials
concerned felt that the State had made a commitment which it could not

fulfill. We realize that an increase of $100 will not trigger the outrage
that doubling the tuition would. But we have our suspicions as to whether
this would be just the first step in easing into a far higher tuition fee
for our University and the other two state-related schools.

We must remember that the outlook for our University as far as
the State Legislature is concerned is far from encouraging. They have
adopted no new method of appropriating funds to forestall the legisla-
tive hassles that have marked the two successive years of our relation-
ship with the State. We have heard promises, but as yet we have seen
no deeds to reinforce the words that flow aplenty from the mouths of
our legislators. Oh, there are some who enthusiastically espouse methods

of improving the status quo; we certainly hope that when the Legislature ,

convenes in March, they will back up their valiant quotes with legislation.

Because our relationship with the state has continually hit snags,
we cannot help but look beyond the hint of a tuition hike in Gov. Shafer’s
budget message and wonder what really lies in store for us. Perhaps
our state could not afford to take the steps it took when it lowered our
tuition two years ago. But we cannot accept that a matter as vital as
this should be approached from such a shortsighted view. We strongly

» recommend the innovation of a five-year budget that would preclude

promising what can only be temporarily fulfilled. The current method
is a most unprofessional way of running a State Government.

Recalls Auritt Case

Police Brutality, Again

Remember Jon Auritt? He’s the Uni-
versity Law School graduate who ‘was as-
saulted by Pittsburgh Police during last
April’s “riot.” Auritt recently won a case
against the City of Pittsburgh for the in-
juries he suffered during the melee at the
hands of Pittsburgh’s finest.

Apparently, the city Police_have not
yet learned that brutality is a thing of the
past. Last month, on the North Side, two

,_ detectives attempted to break up a street

fight involving, according to witnesses,
close to 50 people. The two detectives were
jumped and beaten by the participants, a
group of youths ranging in age from 18
to 31. Most of the participants in the fight
managed to escape from the scene and a
police dragnet went out. Within eight
hours, eight men had been arrested and

charged with aggravated assault and bat-

tery on an officer, riot, and resisting ar-
rest.

On the surface, the case of these eight
men seems to be clear cut. But the reports
of witnesses run contrary to the police re-
ports. For example, the two officers who
were beaten are plajnclothesmen. They ar-
rived on the scene in an unmarked car, us-
ing neither siren or flasher. When the offi-
cers waled into the fight, say the defend-
ants and witnesses, they did not show their
badges or announce that they were police-
men. If this is the case, and counsel for
the defense insists that it is, then the offi-
cers were acting solely as private citizens
at the time. In this case, is it any wonder
they were attacked?

More important, however, is the fact
that almost all of the defendants were
well known to the police officers in ques-
tion. When a general dragnet was de-
clared, would it not be natural that the
police would arrest the men they thought
to be involved, solely by past records? Ac-
cording to defense witnesses, many of the
defendants were not even involved in the
fight.

But the previous events concern only
who was involved in the fight and whether

.the police neglected to show their badges.

The most damning bit of evidence against
the Pittsburgh Police involves two youths
who were arrested and then beaten by P0-
lice from the Number Nine Station. Inter-
estingly enough, these two men did not
even stand trial with the other eight de-

« fendants.

According to personal statements, these
two men were among the first arrested
after the fight. One is from West Virginia
a resident

Upon bein inked by. th

were taken to Station Nine, pulled into a
back sell, and kicked by officers on duty.
One man was beaten so badly that his
Adam’s Apple was dislocated and he was
rushed to Allegheny General Hospital for
an emergency tracheotomy. The other
youth’s injury’s were only slightly less se-
vere.

Unfortunately for the police, two other

.men, also arrested because’ of‘ the fight,

were in a nearby cell and witnessed the
beating. They have agreed to testify when
the case against the police is brought to
court by the American Civil Liberties
Union.

Certain facts do exist in this case. There
was a fight and two police officers were
beaten. Neither the defense nor the prose-
cution disputes these assertions. But it is
unclear as to whether the police were
properly identified and whether the de-
fendants were even involved. Evidence runs
against the police, but with most of the
defendants having past records it seems
reasonable to assert that a jury or judge
will not act with objectivity.

And facts do exist in the case of the
two men who were brutally beaten. They
did not participate in the fight and they
were not injured prior to their arrest. The
only possible conclusion, and one which is
corroborated by witnesses, is that the beat-
ings came at the hands of the Police.

The outcome of the brutality case de-
pends largely on the fairness of the judge
and whether he acknowledges the fact
that not all policemen are defenders of
the people. But if the case of Jon Auritt is
any example, it doesn’t matter how this
latest issue of police brutality is decided,
for the same case, with variations, will
occur again and again until a hard core of
ignorant men is weeded out of the Police
Department of the City of Pittsburgh.

Lack of Spirit
Editor, The Pitt News

Last night (Sunday) twlo bus-
es were chartered from PAT
to take the first 100 students to
board them to the airport to
meet the incoming College Bowl
team. The buses were scheduled
to leave at 9:50 so I arrived at
9:30 to insure my getting a seat.

When 9:50 rolled around I
was the only person there;
there wasnt’ even a Pitt News
reporter or photographer. At 10

and said he thought he might
be able to get some of the guys
on his dorm ﬂoor to come, but
by that time it was too late for
the buses to leave and arrive on
time so the trip was cancelled.

I can’t help thinking that
if the game had been broadcast
that there would have been a
large crowd willing to go. Are
we really so pathetic that if we
don’t get a chance to see a team
play we don’t care? I’m afraid
the answer is yes.

Editor, The Pitt News

My complaint is that some of
the students who own and drive
cars have no consideration for
the people of Oakland. The stu-
dent owners of cars who live in
Oakland p-ark their cars any old
way they care to, disregarding
parking laws and rules, block-
ing driveways, garage entries,
street crossing, etc.

Monday was a day to point

the Editor

this up. I noticed two cars block-
ing my driveway, hood to hood,
at 8 a.m. Hoping someone would
come for the cars, I did nothing
until 10:30 when the police were
called; one car was tagged; the
other was backed down a few
feet and not tagged. At 5:30 the
tagged car was still there, at
which time the police towed it
away. I couldn’t use my own
car that day.

Considering the ﬁnancial stat-
us of most students, we do not
like to have cars towed away,
but in View of the rudeness and
_inconls_ideration of these illegal
1;§aiaaei*§,€v@éiaavefn¢Iassermuemi

Not all parkers are students
at Pitt, there are others as well,
but a great deal of them do go
to Pitt, we know some by sight,
having seem them park for sev-
eral semesters or years.

Another complaint is the noise
of auto horns when one friend
no-tifys friend he is waiting im-
patiently in his car. The hour
of the day or night d=oesn’t mat-
ter, 8 a.m., 8 p.m., 2 or 3 a.m.,
its all the same to those horn
leaners who don’t know how to
walk over to ring a door bell.

Our greatest complaint is the

dirty. unkempt look of some of ’

the “way out” students. Aside
from not being able to tell the
boys from the girls, the dirti-
ness is the one disgusting fea-
ture we object to. These people
(?) make every day look like
Halloween. L

I hope you get this published
in the Pitt News. I have seen
articles of the students com-
plain about the people of Oak-
land, this is how we feel about
some of the students.

at County Observatory

Dr. Nicholas E. Wagman, professor of astronomy at
the University, held class last Tuesday night at the Alle-
gheny County Observatory. Approximately 25 members
of Astronomy 786 drove across town from the Cathedral
of‘ Learning to the North Side, climbed the worn marble
stairway to an open dome to stargaze through the observa-

tory’s third largest telescope.
Through the 13-inch diameter,
107 year-old instrument (origin-
ally valued at $12,000), under
the guidance of D-r. Wagman, the
class viewed the moon, the ring-
ed planet Saturn, the constella-
tion Orion, and Sirius, the bright-
est star, often termed the “Dog
Star” . . . or star of madness.
Dr. Wagman has taught his
course at the University and
served as full-time astronomer at
the observatory for the past 37
years. The present course is the
second part of a two-term pro-
gram. During the fall trimester,
Dr. Wagman covered the origins
of the science of astronomy, in-
cluding ancient theories, religious

implications, and the pseudo-
scince, astrology.

This term the course began
with the astronomer Herchel,
dealing with his studies of binary
stars, star clusters, nebula, mete-
ors, and comets.

The class then branched out to
the discoveries of Schiaparelli
and his “canals” on Mars, dis-
cussed conditions on the planets
Mars, Venus, and Mercury, while
bringing in theories on asteroids
and classification of stars by
light magnitudes. The course text
outlines astronomical discoveries
up to and including modern as-
trophysics.

The New Pittsburgh Film
Group has announced a new
series of Monday night
showings of Underground
Films. The series will fea-
ture works by Warhol, Ku-
char, and many others.

The ﬁlms will be shown at
the Crumbling Wall Coffee
House, one block down Forbes
Ave. from the Cathedral. The
group plans to charge $1 a per-
son to see the ﬁlms, plus an ini-
tial fee of 50 cents for a mem-
bership card in the Group. A
membership is being insisted
upon by the Group because of
a series of events that are plan-
ned in the future which are of
special interest.

The two ﬁlms planned for this
Monday are Andy Warhol's My
Hustler and George Kuchar’s
Hold Me While I'm Naked. Next
week’s presentations will be by

 

the Angry Arts Group, a three
hour commentary on the war in
Vietnam.

Both Warhol and Kuchar have
written on these ﬁlms in articles
for film magazines and catalogs.
Kuchar wrote about Hold Me
While I'm Naked in the “Film
Maker's Cooperative Catalog”
(No. 40). . . . The Film Maker's
Cooperative is an organization
of Underground Film makers
who have banded together for
distribution and artistic pur-
poses.

Kuchar wrote, “A drazzling

Zahn Supports Rights of Pacifists

(Continued from Page 1)

ity.” He stated that the “certain-
ty and severity of penalties for
dis-obeying the law on grounds
of cons-ciencious objection differ-
entiate a totalitarian society
from a democratic society. He
said that the certainty and sev-
erity can be used as an index
of whether a government is mov-
ing toward a totalitarian or a

» democratic pole.

Consciencious objection, con-
tends Dr. Zahn, offers two chal-

’ lenges to society. The ﬁrst is to

allow those who sincerely ob-
ject the right to heed the die-
tates o-f their conscience with-
out “offering an escape hatch
for the cowardly.” He said that
war oppositionists are some-
times motivated by selﬁshness
and excessive emotionalism. D-r.

Zahn denies that these individ-
uals represent the norm of paci-

effective, “should not violate the
principles to which it is keyed,
and should not detract from hu-
man dignity.’ He stated that the
interrelation of conscience and
responsibility must be recogn-
ized” for resistance to be effec-
tive.

Dr. Zahn presented several
means of op-position for those
who consider the Vietnam war
immoral. If draft‘ eligible, the
individual can obtain a conscien-
cious objector classiﬁcation, can
go into alternative service, can
join the resistance movement
by breaking completely with the
draft system and the war, or
can completely evade the war
by emmigrating or disappear-
ing.

Those who are not draft eli-

to correct ﬂaws in the system.
They can “give aid and comfort
to the resistance,” try to build
understanding between war sup-
porters and opposers, and can
assert inﬂuence to end the war.

The role of the church in aid-
ing individuals to heed their con-
science should be “to serve as a
source of dissent and resistance,
and as a haven and sanctuary
for those who do dissent.” He
believes that the church should
embrace a value system involv-
ing conscience and compassion
for the enemy, and should pro-
claim the priority of its value
system. He said that the church-
es have failed miserably so far
by not providing counseling serv-
ices and by not acting as a modi-
ator between dissentens and

gible but oppose the war ca.n try draft authorities.

§,_T€‘S'[Ilng that all consciencious
2:-bjecrtors are -cowvards is “like
sug-ge-sting that everyone involv-
ed in war ﬁghts because he likes

The second challenge in so-
ciety is to not make conscienci-
ous objection “an open invita-
tion to anarchy.” He said that,
although in theory it can do
this, if individual consciences are
formed in the proper manner,
anarchy would not result.

An individual has a respon-
s-ibility to himself, ‘according to
Dr. Zahn, involving bot.h a com-
pelling obligation to follow his
beliefs and an awareness of the
consequences of his actions. If

Depends on the giant. Actually, some giants are just regular
kinds of guys. Except bigger.

And that can be an advantage.

How? Well, for one thing, you‘ve got more going for
you. Take Ford Motor Company. A giant in an exciting
and vital business. Thinking giant thoughts. About develop
ing Mustang. Cougar. A city car for the future.

Come to work for this giant and you‘ll begin to think

like one.

Because you‘re dealing with bigger problems, the
consequences, of course, will be greater. Your responsibilities
heavier. That means your experience must be better~—more
complete-. And so, yeu‘ll get the kind of opportunities only a

giant can give.

Giants just naturally seem to attract top professionals.
Men that you‘ll be workingwith and for. And some of that

talent is bound to rub off.

Because there’s more to do, you'll learn more. In

What’

IllOI'€ 3I'€3.S.

tow

,You‘ll develop a talent for making hard-nosed, imagina-
tive decisions. And you’ll know how these decisions affect
the guts of the operation. At the grass roots. Because you’ll
have been there.

If you‘d like to be a giant yourself, and your better
ideas are in ﬁnance, product engineering, manufacturing,
marketing and sales, personnel administration or systems
research, see the man from Ford when he visits your campus.
Or send your resume to Ford Motor Company, College
Recruiting Department.

You and Ford can grow bigger together.‘

Professor Lewontin To Talk
On the Idea of Evolution

Dr. R. C. Lewontin, professor of zoology and a.-ssociate dean
of biological sciences at the University of Chicago, will discuss “The
Idea of Evolution” in a lecture in Clapp Hall Audit-orium Monday
at 8:15 p.m.

The lecture is ﬁfth in a series sponsored by the University’s
Center for the Philoso-plly of Science.

In his lecture, Dr. Lewontin will exp-lore the development,
since the 18th century, of the idea of evolution in all branches of
science and, in general, in human thought. He will attempt to show
-that the evolutionary world view came into the biological science
only after it had permeated the other branches of natural and of

social science. He will also dem-

BRYANT SALTER
Goes for Seven Feet

by DAVE TIERNAN

“Explode!!” yelled track
coach Jim Banner. “When
you come out of the blocks, ex-
plode.” Banner was talking to
sprinter Dave Garnett, who is
preparing for the New York
invitational track meet at Madi-
son Square Garden to-night.

G-arnett, the record-holding
fresh 60 yard dash runner, will
be in need of all the explosion
he can get when he faces 0. J.
Simpson, Tommie Smith and
possibly Charlie Green in the
60.

Joining Garnett in the meet
will be senior Roger Holly and
another record-breaking fresh-
rnan, Jerry Richey. Holly will
com.pete in the 1000 yard run,
while Richey, school record-

 

Rockets Fall;

Swimmers Go
Against Owls

In what should turn out

to be the closest swimming
meet of the season thus far, the
swimmers are at Temple tomor-
row afternoon. According to all—
around swimmer Rich Norris,
“Temple is strong in the free-
style events, but we’re stronger
in the other races.

“I think we can beat them,”
Norris predicted. “We’re “up”;
We want to win the rest of our
meets and come out with a win-
ning record. We feel we can up-
set them in the freestyles and
take the meet.”

Norris led the swimmers to a
75-38 win over Slippery Rock
Wednesday. He set a pool record
in the 200 yard individual med-
ley with a time of 2112.2. His
brother Ho-ward captured the
1000 yard freestyle while John
Lane took firsts in the 100 and
200 yard freestyle events.

Chris Price broke a Slippery
Rock pool record in the 200 yard
breaststroke by c h u r n i n g
through the warm w a ter in
2:24. 6.

Diver Dean Coleman won both
of his events to cap a successful
meet. He broke another pool rec-
ord by registering 66 points in
the one-meter dive, and he won
the three meter event as well.

holder in the mile and 1000, will
run in the two-mile event.

Although Richey and Holly
will not be as comfortable as
possible in their ﬁrst invitation-
al meet, neither expects any dif-
ﬂculties.

For Holly, the 1000 is not his
favorite race. In the outdo-or
season, he runs the 880, the dis-
tance he most prefers. This year
he has won the 1000 and the
600 yard run indoors.

“Running the 600 has given
me the sprinting experience I
need in the stretch,” Ho-lly said.
“Wade Bell of Oregon will lead
a ﬁeld of stars, but I feel if I
can hold third or fourth, then
make my move in the kick, I will
be able to do all right.’

Richey will run the two-mile

in competition for the first time
since high school, when he turn-
ed in a 9:09.?» time, which is
eight seconds faster than the
varsity record. However, that
time wouldn’t Win the two-mile
walk in New York.

“I know I can run at least an
8:45,” said Ri-chey, “But (Gerry)
Lindgren will probably run
around 8:35. I really don't know
‘how fast I can run two miles,
though,” he added, “I am look-
ing forward to the competition.”
Lindgren competed in the Olym-
pics during his senior year in
high school an-d is considered to
be one of the world's best two-
milers.

But Richey has never really
been pushed.

Bryant Salter, who will join

Garnett and Richey in Balti-
more tomorrow for the invita
tional meet there, overcame the
pressure of his first meet with
the “big names” last week and
matched Olympian John Thom-
as with a personal high and a
school record jump of 6'1 ”.

“You can't tell them (Garnevtt,
Richey and Holly) what the feel-
ing is,” Salter commented be-
tween jumps at practice this
week. Salter will be aiming at
the magic seven foot mark.

In Baltimore, Richey will
switch to the mile, an event he
has Won three times this year,
including a 4:08.6 performance
at home. Other members of that
ﬁeld are as yet unnamed.

Garnett, who has been having
slight troubles with his start in

the 60, feels he has it down pret-
ty well. “I have to start low,” he
noted, “and get a lot of drive.
But when I see someone pass
me coming out of the blocks, I
tend to stand up.”

Possibly Garnett will start
low and upset "O. .I.’_’ and the
rest. Possibly Richey will run
like he never knew he could,
and win both of his events. Pos-
sibly Holly will beat Bell. Pos-
sibly S-al-ter will jump 7’2”.

Possibly, and maybe not. The
main point is what Salter re-
lated to others. He said that last
week in the Philadelphia Classic,
when he signed up for the high
jump, one official said, “It’s 
to see Pitt represented again
after all these years.” Would
you believe it's been 12?

Hungry Wrestle rs Host Franklin & Marshall; ~
Surprising Diplo mats No Breather fr Matmen  

by ROY JACOBS

With several hundred high
school wrestlers likely to be
on hand to watch tomor-
row’s wrestling meet with Frank-
lin and Marshall, the varsity
gnapplers could give the recruit-
ing program a boost with a
convincing victory.

Coach Dave Adams also urged
University students to come to
the Field House tomorrow,
which has been designated as
High School» Wrestling Day. The
meet starts at 2 p.m.

Coming in between Michigan

and Lehigh, Franklin and Mar-
shall might be regarded as a
breather for the maatmen. Adams
discount-ed this point almost be-
fore the question was asked.

“They’ve only lost one meet
that I know 0 ,” explained the
coach, “and that was to Prince-
ton, who also beat Lehigh. It
certainly doesn't sound like a
breather.”

Among the Diplomats’ victims
are Columbia (25-11), Harvard
(21-20), and Bucknell (26-3).

“We stand a good chance with
them,’.’ offered the coach. “We’re

Gym Team Visits Mass.

The gymnasts journey to Massachusetts tomorrow,

and coach Warren Neiger is hoping for a good day from
his three top varsity men to prepare them for the Eastern Cham-

pionships next month.

“I can only take my varsity
with me to Navy,” commented
Neiger. “Bob Dodson can do a
fine job on parallel bars and
longhorse, and Tom Fisher can
score an 8.0 on still rings. But
Dave Shidemantle, of course, is
our big hope for the EIGL meet.”

“Winning this meet isn't the
important thing,” said Neiger. “I
want to watch Dodson and Fisher
and Shidemantle go through their
routines. Fisher is still having
trouble on the rings and Dodson
can use more work on the high
bar. We will rest Shidemantle if
there is any possibility of an in-
jury. They only have three more
good weeks left to practice."

improved over the team that beat
them last year, 149.75-1442.75.
Massachusetts also has some fine
prospects for the Easterns in-
cluding sophomore all-around man
Rich Reed. Reed can score 9.0
or higher on the floor exercise,
still rings, longhorse, and parallel
bars. Rich Delgallo, a 9.20 man
on still rings, can also score 9.1
on floor exercise.

The Kasavana boys, Mike and
Tom, are also fine material for
the Easterns on the longhorse
and trampoline. Mike can score
8.55 on the tramp, and Tom aver-
ages about 7.5 on that event. He
also averages about 8.80 on the
longhorse. Bob Leﬂlalr leads
M cluxsett th I i

   
 
 

   

in as good a position to win as
they are.”

Although not knowing too
much about F&M, Adams did
reveal that the Diplomats have
two top wrestlers that placed in
the Easterns last year —— John
Homiak at 137 and Jim Clair
at 152, 160, or 167.

“If Larry Cuba can knock off
Homiak, it'll be a big boost for
us,” commented Adams, “but
I'm still uncertain about how
we'll wrestle the upper weight
classes.” The coach lis-ted two
possibilities at 167, three at 177,
three at 191, and two at heavy-
weight.

“They all will be weighed in
and ready to go,” he added.

Probably the biggest Field
House crowd of the season for
any Pitt sports event will see
tomorrow’s meet. The purpose
of High School Wrestling Day
is to introduce the wrestlers
from central and western Penn-
sylvania to the school, and as
of Wednesday over a dozen high
schools had responded affirma-
tively. Adams feels they should
help his boys.

“I would expect that they'll be
doing a lot of cheering,” said
the coach, “because these are
knowledgeable people. We want
to expose them to the campus
and to the freshman program

and possibly wind up with a few
here.”

i This is not to say that Adams

LARRY CUBA
Crucial 137 Match

“We’d like to have them,” en-
couraged Adams. “We were real
pleased with the reaction of the
crowd the last time. They all
seemed to know quite a. bit about
wrestling. They knew the right
time -to cheer.”

Dave Adams knows that to-

morrow is the right time, too-

Even if Franklin and Marshall
isnft a breather, tomorrow’s
meet is the right time to Win
dual meet number three, build
some momentum ﬂor Lehigh and
Penn State, and do some good
recruiting besides.

 

    
    
  
   
  
  
  
 
  
   
  
 

 
 
  
  
    

 

 

 

 

1  1- l:»...1o — THE prrr NEWS — Friday, February 9. 1968

Tony Delisio jumps for two against Kent.

tle a score with the Duquesne Frosh Sunday at the Civic

Arena. The only,other time the
two teams faced each other, the
Little Dukes clobbered the small-
er Cubs, 86.59.

Since losing to the Little Dukes,

the freshman cagers have beat-

en Carnegie -Mellon University,
Johnstown, and Point Park in
succession. The three game win-
ning streak has lifted the Cubs’
record to 5-3.

But the three wins came at the
hands of smaller and weaker foes
who perennially seem to lack
basketball talent. And even in
those games, the Cubs didn't play
as well as expected

However, Duquesne offers a
true test for the Cubs. Coach Al
Bailey’s undefeated squad has
height, speed, besides inside and
outside shooting.

The Little Dukes are led by
Jarrett Durham, a 6-4 forward
averaging 24 points per game,
and Steve McHugh, a 6-0 guard
from Geneva, Ohio. Durham and
McHugh are scoring threats from
inside and outside.

And they both have ample
chances to handle the ball be-
cause two 6-9 twins from Fox
Chapel. Barry and Gary Nelson,
usually control the boards.

 

Freshman basketball coach Tim
Grgurich insists that his team is
not 27 points worse than the Lit-
tle Dukes. But the Cubs have a

LafayetteBandboX May Play   R
Different Tune On Panthers

In 1962-63, coach Bob
Timmons’ had one senior in
the starting lineup and the Pan-
thers were headed for a 19-6 sea-
son and an NCAA bid. Tomor-
row night at Lafayette, Timmons
again goes with a single starting
senior, Pete Smith. But this sea-
son, the Panthers are stuck in the
fourth year of a four-year slump.

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAJ

The team record is 5-10. And,

the only hid going to this year’s
contingent will be to the All-
Sports Banquet in April.

At Lafayette, the pressure of
winning the 24th game in the
last 85 will be on Timmons. And
the Panthers coming off a two

game losing streak which fol-

lowed the-first two game win-
ning streak since 1963-64, will
be tested by the Lafayette band-

box gym.

“Lafayette deﬁnitely will have
the advantage tomorrow,” Tim-
mons forecasted. “That small
gym could hurt us.”

At the Field House last year,
the Panthers knocked-off the
Leopards, 58-48. But two of the
Panthers who scored 30 points
last year, Jim LaValley (grad-
uation) and Al DiFrischia (aca-
demic ineligibility) are gone.
Only Len Kalata, is back. He
had 13 against Lafayette las-t

    

to it,’ Timmons said. “Lafayette
is about as tall as our team.”

Lafayette’s threat, 6-5 senior
Bob Clements, scored only ten
points at the Field House. At
home though, Clements’ outside
shot is consistent.

Last year Lafayette had a 4-21
record; the Panthers were 6-19.
The ﬁrst time the Panthers de-
feated Lafayette, 31-24 was in

1914-15; since 1953-63, Timmons
owns two victories in two games
over the Leopards.

After tomorrow's game, the
Panthers face only six more ‘op-
ponents. They need at least three
wins for the team’s best record
in four years.

Home games remain against

Virginia.

by MARTHA HARTLE

Delta Tau Delta upset
Phi Epsilon Pi 45-41 in fra-
ternity “A” League action,
eliminating Phi Epﬁs title hopes,
while co-leaders Sigma Chi and
Delta Sigma Phi both won easi-
ly.

The Delts built up a seven
point lead over Phi Ep in the
ﬁrst half as a Phi Ep rally fell
short.

Bill Buck led the Delts with
19 points. Bob Loughrey added
13 for the winners. Jeff’ Levhoff
and Bob Black hit double fig-
ures for Phi Ep with 13 and 12
points, respectively.

Delta Sigma Phi outclassed
Zeta Beta Tau, 89-38. Joe Mc-

. Cain, Chuck Winters and Carry
/Trachak accounted for 73 of the
/winners’ 89 points. McCain, mix-

ing long set shots and jumpers
with driving lay-ups, led all
scorers with 32. Winters hit for
25,"while Trachak added 16. Jeff
Heimberg led the losers with
nine points.

Sigma Chi handed Sigma Al-
pha Mu its seventh straight loss
without much of a struggle 60-
19. The winners took a 30-13 lc-ad
at the half and continued to
pou-r it on throughout the con-
test. /

George Medich and Dan Pa-
rise led Sigma Chi with 10 points
each. Jeff Brown added nine for
the Winners. Steven Koteen was
high iscorer for SAM with sev-
en. 

In a battle of the League “A”
also-rants, Phi Kappa Theta clob-
bered Pi Lambda Phi, 63-32. Phi

‘ Kap grabbed an early lead and

completely dominated play in
both halves. Sam Pennella was
the high scorer for the winners
with 20 points. Gerry Fair add-
ed 10.

In League “B’ action, Pi Kap-
pa Alpha clinched the cham-
pionship without taking the
floor as Lambda Sigma Rho for-
feited its scheduled contest. Pi
Ka finished league play with a

5-0 record and will meet the
Delta Sig-Sig Chi winner Mon-
day at 5:30 p.m. for the a1l-fra-
ternity crown. -

In other “B” action, Kappa

silon, 51-27. The victory was the
fourth for Kappa Sig, whose
only loss came at the hands of
PiKa. Mark Zovko led Kappa
Sig scoring.

Palace Outguns Panther
House In Dorm Playoffs

Pleasure Palace couldn’t
come up with its usual big
score Tuesday, but they did pull
out its most important victory.
The 48-40 decision over Panther
House, the League “B” champs,
gave the “A” kings the dorm
championship.

Both teams started slow. But
the Palace proved stronge-r in
the second half after holding a
slight one-point half-time mar-
gin.

Again Warren Allen with 10
points paced the champs. This
time he shared team scoring
honors with Al Nalli and Frank
Hartz, each scoring ten points.

Ron Davis tallied 14 points
and Rich Hein got 11 points in
a losing effort for Panther.

The win moves the Palace
into the All-Campus Tourney

r as the dorm representative. The

dorm champ clashes with the
fraternity champs Tuesday. The

_winner advances into the ﬁve-

team tourney ﬁnals.

The Panthers’ offensive center,
Tom Mitrakos, was drafted last
week by the San Francisco ’49ers
of the National Football League.

The 6-4, 220 pound Mitrakos
spent a hectic three years at Pitt.

linebacker. In his junior year, he
was moved to the offensive line,
starting at tackle and center
where he made Notre Dame’s All-
Opponent team. And last season
Mitrakos finally wound up at cen-

“I’m really excited about going
to the ’49ers,” Mitrakos says.
“After I graduate, I'll go to the
coast and maybe buy myself a.
little house somewhere,” he grins.
