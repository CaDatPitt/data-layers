Pitt News Staff Writer

He started as a drunken bull, and
went on to become a French skunk,
a baby bird, and a tough rabbit.
Mel Blane is the voice of Bugs
Bunny, Tweety bird, Peppie LaPue
and other cartoon characters.

Blane said that he has been
creating his unusual voices since
childhood, and that of the 400
different voices he can perform,
Bugs Bunny is his favorite.

“I ﬁgured helwas a tough ‘little

stinker, so I had to give him a tough ,

voice,” Blane explained. “I
thought of what the toughest voice
was in this country, and I ﬁgured it
was either Brookly_n or the Bronx.

So I put the two of them together "

and that’s _h0VlLI got the voice of
Bugs.”
"Blane also explained how he

developed some "of his other»

characters.

Tweety was a baby bird, “so I
had to give him a baby voice,”
Blane said. Sylvester, a sloppy cat,

has a sloppy voice. ,"Blanc said he «

gave a French -skunk, Preppie La
Pue, a little French voice because
“he’s a great lover...he kisses the

pussy cats.” - ._ .
-As a child, Blane entertained his
teachers and classmates at ‘school
. assemblies.  p
“The kids would laugh, and the
"teachers would laugh and then
normally give me lousy. marks,”
Blanc said. -

Blane went on to dabble in radio,

perform with dance bands, and I‘

eventually appear with Jack Benny.
Blane explained their routine:

‘‘I came in with a sombrero on
my head and a "guitar in my hand.
Benny said: " ' " " ’

City Agencies Come to"Aid of Fire Victims" 

By NICK ARNETT

Pitt News Staff Writer

City and university agencies are
rallying to the help of Pitt students
and others left homeless by a
general-alarm ﬁre last Wednesday
at the Saybrook apartment building
on Craft Avenue. No one will be
returning to the 58-unit structure
because the city has condemned it,
but the one-hundred people who

lived there are eligible for federal"

and city aid. Thelcause of the
$200,000 ﬁre is still under
investigation._ "

Lydia Lewis of the American Red
Cross Disaster Services said they
have , helped approximately 60
victims of the ﬁre, of whom at least
fourteen are full-time Pitt students.
The Red Cross is providing food,
clothing, cooking and eating
utensils, and the ﬁrst month’s rent
for a new apartment to those who
need it. However, all of, the
residents have apparently found
temporary places. to live, Lewis
said. Former Saybrook tenants
who need permanent housing have
been "referred to ‘the Relocation
Agency of the Pittsburgh. Housing
Authority. g -

""" ~ Rel"o"cat"ion‘ -.A"uth"ority spokesper-

son Betsy Pugh" said that because
the building has been condemned,
former tenants are eligible to skip

normal waiting lists for public

‘What does she do for a living?’
‘Sew.’

housing and loan assistance. Pugh
said the agency will pay for up to
two moves for ﬁre victims and will
help them ﬁnd new apartments.

If they qualify, Pugh said, they
can immediately enter the federal
governmcnt’s “Section Eight"
plan, in which the government pays
three-quarters of the individual’s
rent. There is normally about a
one-and-a-half year waiting time.
The government will only generally
approve single apartments for
single, non-related people.

Pugh said thatstudents who had
shared an apartment with non-
relatedpeople might not be able to
continue to do so. She also said
that determining income elibigiliby
is complicated forstudents receiv-
ing ﬁnancial aid or working part
time.

“This might be a test case,”
Pugh said. \ -

The Pitt/CMU Off-Campus
Housing Ofﬁce is also ready to help
Saybrook victims. Director of the
ofﬁce Mary Lou Sosso said that
although students -‘have been
referred to her ofﬁce, none have
come. Two non-students did come
in, and Sosso said they were
helped, “but. Pitt or CMU students
will take priority.”

g So‘ss.o_ said the ‘office wi1l."giV’e‘ "
stiidentswho are ﬁre victims “-first

their needs, and will also encour-
agev them to use the ofﬁce’s

roommate service.

Competition: Keyword In B-Ball  

By MIKE DICHIARA

Pin News Sports Edilnr
The Eastern Eight’s three area

_ teams’ head coaches were on hand

for ‘the introduction of the new

“ basketball season at the Hilton

Hotelyesterday. Mike Rice of
Duquesne, Gale Catlett of West

‘ Virginia, and Roy Chipman of _Pitt

spoke about their teams and the
upcoming Eastern Eight season.

- “We have a lot of competition for
all the positions,” said WVU coach
Catlett. “We lost Lowes Moore
whowas last years’ MVP in the
tournament and who is now the
only Eastern Eight player in the
pros. He’s with the New Jersey

‘ Nets and has been doing very well.

“This is my third year at
WVU,” he continued. “My first
year, we were picked to finish
seventh in the league and we
finished second. Last season we

‘ended with a rush and finished.
. second in the tournament.”

The Mountaineers ﬁgure to be
fairly strong in the front line as all
three starters are returning from
last year's team. The center will
most likely be junior Phil Collins.
At 6-foot-9 he averaged almost
eight points per game and seven
rebounds. At forward, the two
probable starters are Greg Nance
and Russell Todd. Nance is a
6-foot-8 senior who averaged 13
points and seven rebounds per
game last season. Todd is a
6-foot-7 sophomore who averaged
eight points and five rebounds.

According to Catlett, the Moun-
ties problems will stem from the
guard position.

“We have to get people in the
backcourt," said Catlett. , ‘‘I like

V the big-guard system but haven’t

have/’
At one guard, sophomore Noah

.Moore will be one starter. At

6-foot-8, he is the big guard that
in his

Moore averaged under four points
per game in limited action and
Jones averaged five points. ,

Overall, the West Virginia squad
is a young one. Nance is the only
senior among the starters. The
Mounties are also bigger physically
this season, as they have nine
players that are at least 6-foot-7.

Duquesne is probably one of the
biggest question marks in the
league this year. According to
coach Mike Rice, the Dukes will
find out quickly the kind of team-
they have.

“We play Rhode Island the
second game this year and we will
find out what we have as a team
very early,” said Rice. “Bruce
Atkins will be in there and we'll
need a lot from him.”

The Dukes suffered quite a bit
from the graduation of B.B.

Flenory, the dismissal of leading_

scorer Doug Arnold, and the
academic probation of 7-foot Ricky

Tunstall. Those losses have forced it

Rice to completely revamp his
team's style of play. i

“The guards will run the show,”
said Rice. “We’re not going to run
up and down the court. We’ll be ‘a
slower type team and we'll work
hard on execution.”

At center, Duquesne will start.

Bruce Atkins, a 6-foot-7 junior who
averaged over 10 points and nine
rebounds per game last season.
The forwards will probably start
junior Rod Scott and senior John
Moore. Moore, a 6-foot-7 senior is
a question mark for Rice, since he
is coming off a knee operation
which had him sidelined last year.
Scott is a 6-foot-4 junior who, in
limited play, averaged two points
and one rebound per game.

averaged eight points per game
and had 70 assists last season. The
other guard position will be shared
by Andy Sisinni and Tom Cvitkovic.

“Ronnie Dixon should be good,”

‘‘I’m impressed with how hard they work..T\hey’ve committed themselves
to having a good year,”_said Pitt coach Roy Chipman about histeam.

That statement is evident in the ag

about what we have.”'
