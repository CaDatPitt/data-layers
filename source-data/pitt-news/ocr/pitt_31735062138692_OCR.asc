 I. Production
ny ELEANOR CLAWSON . -. V, V
Somewhere in the ‘southwest Pa-
ciﬁc, G. I. actors are dasyling‘ around
getting ready for the “big show’'——
not on a battleﬁeld this time but on
a make-shift stage. _ ‘ ’
But the show itself is far from
make-shift. It is anoriginal music-al
revue icalled “Snafu,” a. study ‘in
khaki written, p_roduced, staged, and
acted’ by soldiers. Big man ‘of the
show is E_'d Morgan, director of Pitt’s
1941 Cap_and Gownushow, “Head
Over Heels,” .wllo conceived this G.
I. .production. Ed also worked-"with
Gene Kelly in several earlie_r_ Cap
and Gown shows. Now he has trans-
ferred his talents from Pitt to the
American Red Cross, in cooperation
with‘ the U.'S. Army Special Ser-
vices, who made “Snafu” possible.
The  I.’s, who stage their own
shows, because they can’t see new
productions, like everything about
this unique show. Two tunes, “I
Wonder What's‘ Happening Back
Home” and .“Wacky Over a
.Wave,” are favorites of the 23
numbers in the show. One, con-
sisting of six scenes, is called “The
Lucky Six.” The ﬁfth scene of this
number presents a college com-
mencement and, from aid reports,
it isea small masterpiece of Amus-
ical comedy. Before the ﬁnale, Di-
rector Ed sings a solo, “Six Feet
of Eccentricity.” '
' The soldier show opened at the
Wintergarden Theater “somewhere
in Australia” on January 30 with a
schedule of four matinees and four
evening performances. In a tradi-
tional letter to Theodore W. Biddle,
dean of men, Ed writes that “Snafu”
is “the.biggest thing in the south-_
west Paciﬁc—.and that it is being
written up in “Yank” and in news
magazines. .
If the theater does any post-war
planning, perhaps then G.I. talent
productions will constitute a part of
it. Some day this popular rev ew
may ..be Nixon-bound. . Meanw le,

._._ ._ model cadet uniforms

_ A’ The uniform, which consists of,
an attractive two- piece suit of
gray wool contrasted by regi-
mental red epaulets, silver insig-

‘nia-buttons and the cadet sleeve,
in,s‘ignia,i was .modeled in Pitts-_
burgh-for the ﬁrst time this week.

‘ _It was selected by a jury of New
York fashion editors. The coat
and suit was designed by Molly
Parnis and the beret by Sally Vic-

. tor. ' 0

' The cadet sleeve insignia, a sil-

ver Maltese Cross in a red ground,

is one of the oldest symbols _-of
nursing, .dating back to the ﬁrst
crusades when it was adopted as
the_ insignia of the Knight Hospital-

ers. ,
~A modern touch is added to the

cadet uniform by the adaptation of

the famous Montgomery beret. The

Public Health Service cap device,

an American shield and spreadeagle

super—imposed. on -the anchor and
cadeucues, is worn on the breast.

'The winter top-coat is of gray

wool. Like the uniform, it-has
red elpaulets and sleeve insignia.

-Silver buttons bear the United
States Public Health Service in-
-signia. ‘ ~

Wearing the uniform is optional
with thestudents except on special
occasions designated by the dean.-

Since July 1, 1943, when the-gov-
ernment approved the cadet nurse
corps plan, ‘girls have been able‘ to
become cadet nurses at the govern-
ment’s expense. Two years-in pre-
nursing school and twenty-eight
months in the School of Nursing
are required before student nurses
receive their bachelor’s degree from
the University.

The salary for pre-cadets is $15
a. month stipend; for junior cadets,
$20 a month stipend; and a mini-
mum of $30 a month with main-

, tenance for senior cadets.

Cadets live under the same rules
and regulations as the non-cadets,
During the major portion of their
nursing period, the pre-cadets and
cadets live in Eleanor Magee hos-
pital at’Fol "Des and Halket Streets.

The first enior cadets will grad-
uate May 1, 1944.

Careless talk can do harm on the home front.

Change Effective

ln Postage Rates
Alter March 26

Commenting on the increase in
some of the postage rates and fees
effective Sunday, Pittsburgh, Post-
master S. A. Bodkin said, “Mail
sent on and after March 26, 1944,
bearing postage at the former rate,
will be subject to delay.”

The rate on local letters is in-
creased from two cents to three
cents for each ounce or fraction,
making it the same as the rate to
out-of-town points.

Air mail letters for delivery in
the United States will require
eight cents postage instead of the
former six cents for each ounce or

tinue to apply to air mail sent to
or by the armed forces of the
United States overseas which-are
served through army and navy post
oﬂices. '

The postage has been increased
approximately three per cent for
fourth class or parcel post. This
will result. in an increase per pack-
age ranging from one cent to twen-
ty-three cents, depending on the
weight and the zone of destination.

The special postage rate on books
has been ‘increased from one cent
to six cents per package, depend-
ing on the weight.

Money order, registry, insurance,
‘and. C.O.D, fees have been in-
creased. T-he V-largest money order
obtainable is for $100. Fees for this
range from ten cents to thirty-seven
cents, depending upon the amount.
of the money _o_r_cler.jMai‘l may be_
registered for a value up to $1,000,
while parcels may be insured up to
a value of $200. Fees for these serv-

latest form. Nevertheless, after a
diet of baggy chorus girls, second
rate road pro-ductions, second rate
road actors, etc.,_ we can do no less
than exalt atithe brilliance of the
current musical. The singing, except
for one or two instances, is excel-
lent. Dialogue on the most part is
very snappy and sparkling. The cos-
tumes are superb without being
gaudy. No -set of compliments can
do justice to the musical ‘arrange-

“A Connecticut Yankee” was
first produced about seventeen
years ago, and its popular suc-
cess made it one of the musical-
comedy classics of the theater.
“My Heart Stood Still” is as beau-
tiful today as it was in the orig-
inal performance. Dick Foran, the
handsome refugee from one hun-
dred movies, sings it and hypno-
tizes the audience with the ef-
fectiveness of his voice. “Thou
Swell” is another old tune of great
merit which will not fail to cap-
tivate audiences. * ', - '

Vivian Segal-, a veteran of many
years of musical comedy, performs
with such vocal dexterity and ease
that the perfection of her singing
will bepoverlooked. As a fellow crit-
ic pointed out to me in a burst of
un-natural perception, her enuncia-
tion in the singing’ of “To Keep My
Love Alive” was “clear as a bell.”
The eifect of » the song, is entirely
contained in the clever lyrics; other
musical comedy queens have the un-
canny knack of dissolving words in
a hidden compartment of their dia-
phrams. The song, incidentally, is
Queen Morgan Le Fay’s story of the
fate of two or three dozen husbands.

Directors of the Theater Guild Subscription program really knew
what they were doing when they obtained Richard Rodgers’ production
of “A Connecticut Yankee” for the Guild’s ﬁfth presentation of the
season. Mark Twain might have difficulty recognizing this streamlined
musical as an adaptation of his famous novel, but he could not fail to
appreciate it as a dose of magniﬁcent entertainment.

An adequate description of “A Connecticut Yankee”
to exhaust one’s vocabulary of" superlatives. This is not to say that
it will march into immortality in itsv

Praise must gush forth with re-
newed vilality at the mention of
the dancing of Vera-Ellen. Her
work is a polished example of tap .
dancing and singing comedy. It.

might be added that she is very 

pretty.

Mimi Berry as the romantic inc.
terest of Mr. Foran is excellent,
though her voice is not suited to

his. Robert Chisholm is the naive" ‘

King Arthur "from topto bottom.

A. J. Herbert as Merlin, and the H.

other actors who murder Tenny-
son’s conception of the round table

boys, play their parts with great;
skill. Sir Galahad and Sir Gawain, A

played by Cl1ester'Stratton and J ere,
McMahon, appear in spectacular
dance routines. V ' '-

The restrained and thereby dou-" -

bly elfectivé lighting deserves- "

mention as does the entire tech-,
nical set-up, spotlights, ‘scenery,
and all. Technical excellence com-

plemented the spirited and ﬂuent , 
performances of Miss Segal and-.,,,

As for the plot——if you haven’t 
read “A Connecticut Yankee in=King “ ‘

Arthur"-’s Court,” you’re ignorant.
This particular version was jazzed

up to complete modernity, perhaps a
toexccss. But, when all else is so‘

ﬂawless, why complain?

To Curriculum A

Pitt not only keeps in step with
the times’but is often a step ahead
of them.

I With the realization that educa-
tion has_ suddenly ‘taken on a new
seriousness because of the war,
the University is among the first
of schools and colleges to see the -
need‘ for more useful courses of
study.

One of the ﬁrst new classes to be
added‘ to the University's curricu-
lum was the extensive language
course develo ed through use of
military personnel under the Army

Students». speak languages ﬂuently
and correctly after a few weeks. , ,

An __ an endeavor to improve
weak local governments of Amer-
ica, -a_ novel political science
course, dealing with municipal
government, has been started.
‘Every Thursday evening, a group
of serious-minded students’ meets '
in Room 116 of the_Cathedral to
study ,‘ the structure, functions,
and -administrative units of the
Pittsburgh metropolitan area and
problems of regional government
in Pennsylvania. -

The course, which was startedat
the suggestion of the Pennsylvania

Former Instructor
Teaches Pitt Boys
At Bethény College

No matter where you go, the odds
are that you’ll always meet some-
one from Pitt. ‘

And that was just the case with
Burton H. Gildersleeve, former in-
structor of ﬁnance at the Univer-
sity, when he accepted a position on
the Bethany College campus in West
Virginia. 1

Mr. Gildersleeve, acting as head
of the department of economics

Bethany, discovered that among

the group of Navy V-12 and V-5

men he is instructing three for-'

mer Pitt students. They are Joe ,

Mocha, star passer of Pitt’s foot-

ball squad last season, Cy Plazak,

who played‘-the”role of quarter-
back, and Dick Mehalick, former
prominent Sigma Chi.

‘ Although this brings back mem-
ories of the three years he taught
at Pitt, Mr. Gildersleeve says,
“The size of my classes have in-
creased from about 60 students to
130, which means Saturday class-
;s.f.Tha:;’s something I never had

e ore. . '

- After-receiving a bachelor or
science degree from the University
of Iowa, Mr. Gildersleeve attended
New York University to earn a mas-
ter's degree in business adminis-
tration.,He also studied at Cornell
Universityand Ohio State.

Pierre To Assist At
New Kensington

’ Joe _Pierre,who has completed his
college gridiron chores as the regu-
lar end for Clark Shaughnessy’s
squad, has justreceived an ap-
pointment as assistant football
coach and physical education in-
structor at New Kensington high
school. 1 ‘

Joe started his career at’his home
town high school, Windber. In his
sophomore year, 1937, Joe played
end on the team that ,won the sec-
tional championship and as a Sen-

ior was chosen by the Altoona news- -

Sticlcel Cvercameo

paper in cooperation with the
coaches as end on the All Section
team.

Stepping from the high school

gridiron on ‘to the college turf
meant little to Joe. Joe played end
on Charlie Bowser’s 1940, 1941, and
1942 elevens and climaxed his play-
ing career at Pitt under _Clark

' Shauglinessy. , -

Joe’s_ appointment as assistant
coach brings about a strange coin-
cidence. Joe played’ high school hall
under Don Fletcher and Duke Wie-
gle. Don Fletcher is now New Ken-
sington’s,‘head, coach ‘and Wiegle‘ is
coaching ‘the Mc-Keesport power

house, New _Kens-ington’s keen

rival. '

‘Snow Confines

Mitterling Men

Heavy snowfall has caused Coach

jltlitterling to keep his outﬁelders
iand inﬁelders out of uniform this

week because of the limitation of
space and the team’s inability to get
outdoors. The small plot under the
Stadium may well prove to be Mr.
M’s. victory garden; for were it not
for this spot (and it’s not much
more), Coach Mitterling’s baseball-
ers would have had to postpone
practices till the weather had
cleared. -

The pitching staff leads one toibe
optimistic about this season’s chanc-
es. Among the pitching candidates
are Jim Davis, Jay Weinberger, Max
Scherb, Jim Reber, Jack Citron,
George Goldberg, and a newcomer,
Lozar, a lefty who also plays first
base. Reviving all the form which

, he had under his thumb and two

fore ﬁngers last season is Big Jim
Reber. Then too, Jack Citron, whosel
career on last season’s nine was
short-lived because of outside work,
is showing speed and ﬁne control.

Nor is the Coach making any
complaints about his ._ catching de-
partment, with holdovers like last
season’s No. 1- catcher, Joe Kielb,
and Al Wettengel, the No. 1 back-
stop from the year before. Also out
for the’ same position is Frank Gal-

"lo; a newcomer.

Handicap To Star

Home recentlyoii “enroute” leave
was Lt. Harold J. "Hap” Stickel,
outstanding» low-hurdles man of
Coach Carl Olson’s— cracker-jack
thinclads of ‘several seasons ago,
and more -recently, Coach of Pitt's‘
1943 track team. Stickel, graduat-

of the best-known as well‘ as one of
the best-liked athletes in Pitt his-
tory. b ’ ’

Hap’s history reads like a collegi-
ate Horatio Algers. At the tender
age of six, he learned what a bad
inﬂuence women were. In a ﬁght
with another youngster over a
maiden’s affections, Hap was badly
hurt and as a result his entire right
side was paralyzed. Old-man-gloom
moved imvwith young Stickel and

- prepared for a lifetime stay, but
- Hap replied by lifting his clenched
' ﬁst to his face, unwrapping his

ﬁngers, and wiggeling,-them vigor-
ously. Hap’s father had been a star
sprintman at Dickenson College
and Hap was determined that he,
too, would make 9. name for him-
self in athletics. “ 
In Hap’: own words, “If you
make up your mind that you can
run—then you can run,” and Hap
Stickel didsmake up his mind—with
a vengeance.

So thoroughly determined was
he, that he soon was able to wall;
