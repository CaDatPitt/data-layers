Former Pitt Gymnast
Loses Court Battle

By TOM KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer

In October 1972, a young Pitt
gymnast fell while attempting to
perform a maneuver called the
“dislocate” during practice.

As a result of the fall, Thomas A.
Cardamone Jr. now 26, suffered
spinal injuries that paralyzed him
from the shoulders down.

Cardamone spent nine months in
rehabilitation, first at Presbyterian
Hospital and later at St. Francis,
before doctors sent him home to
Bethel Park, informing his parents
he would remain a quadripelegic
for the rest of his life.

Pitt paid all hospital and medical
bills during the ﬁrst year after the
accident, and, according to Thomas
Cardamone Sr., promised to
provide care for the rest of young
Cardamone’s life.

Cardamone and his wife Mar-
garet, contend the University has
not honored that promise.

After years of unsuccessful
negotiations with Pitt officials, the
Cardamones sued Pitt for alleged
negligence. Trial proceedings be-
gan last November.

Last week, after more than 12
hours of deliberation, the jury
found Pitt not negligent.

The ruling stunned the Carda-
mones and their lawyers, Louis M.
Tarasi Jr. and John Conte.

“They (the University) made a
lot of promises,” the elder
Cardamone said. “They told us
they would take care.of Tommy for
the rest of his life.”

“They simply reneged on their
promise,” Tarasi said.

During the trial, the former
gymnast maintained he was never
taught the’ correct procedure for
performing the dislocate, which is
achieved by rotating the shoulders
while upside down on the exercise
rings. The gymnast then swings
backward, and his body moves in a
circular motion, returning to the
upside down position. The gym-
nast’s arms should be kept
completely straight. ‘

Cardamone said he always bent
his arms during this procedure,
but never was corrected by the
coaches.

His father said he believes the
coaches did not spend enough
time with his son.

According to the elder Carda-
mone, the University offered to
settle the case out of court last
year. At one point, the University
offered to settle for as much as
$900,000. Another offer reportedly
would have covered Cardamone’s
medical expenses of $159,000, and
paid him $2,800 a month during the
next seven years and $3,700 a
month for the rest of his life.

' “We were all ready to settle, and
they reneged,” Cardamone said.

Tarasi and Conte ﬁled an apeal
Wednsday for \a retrial. It is
uncertain at this time when a
decision on the appeal will be
reached.

“Something terrible happened
to our son," the elder Cardamone
said. “He needs 24-hour care, and
must rely on medication for the rest
of his life. How can they turn their
backs on this?”

Pitt News Staffers Elect
Interim Editor-In-Chief

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt News Staff Writer

News editor Margaret McKay
was elected interim Pitt News
editor-in-chief from Jan. 15 to
March 15, replacing Cristopher C.
Hoe], who resigned Dec. 31.

McKay, a junior writing major,
tallied 12 4/5 votes to managing
editor Jim Lewis’s 12 2/5 votes and
reporter Rodney Grifﬁth’s five
votes in a vote by Pitt News staffers.

McKay joined the Pitt News in
1975, and became features editor in
September 1976. She became
assistant news editor later that
year, and has served as news editor
since March 1977. ,

In her election speech, McKay
stressed the need for The Pitt News
to recruit new writers, and Said
emphasis should be put on the
quality of reporting.

“The paper must revive its
recruiting methods, and must ﬁnd
ways to interest those writers and
students who are dissatisfied with
it. We need people who have ideas
for improvement. A fresh, critical
eye would help everyone tremend-
ously,” McKay said.

She emphasized the need for
enforced dealines and improved
quality of page layouts. McKay also
plans to establish regular ofﬁce
hours, aside from deadline nights.

She currently is devising a new
recruitment plan, in which re-
presentatives from The Pitt News
would visit high schools to interest
new writers, as well as recruiting
Pitt students enrolled in writing
courses.

The vote count was in fractions
because in election for Pitt News
editor, the votes of the business
staff count less than those of
writers. _

The election for editor-in-chief for
the year beginning March 15 will be
held in mid-February.

advantage of the three-day weekend.

Course Descriptions Modified  

By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Staff Writer

A revised course description for
spring and summer term courses
has been developed by the Student
Government Board in conjunction
with CAS Dean Robert Marshall.

The publications are expected to
be ready next month.

SGB member Josh Baylson, who
co-ordinated the project, said he

2 found this term’ s course description

contained a number of incomplete
paragraphs that failed to fully
inform students as to the nature of
the class and its requirements.

“It is our belief that it is the
students’ right to have accurate
information concerning all Univer-
sity courses,” Baylson said.

The" new course description will
offer students detailed information
about each course offered.

Prior to the course descriptions’

publications, all CAS faculty”

members will be asked questions
concerning course prerequisites,
required texts and their availability,
exam grading, classroom participa-
tion, attendance and homework.

The form also will indicate
expected class size, the weight of
recitation grades and future terms
during which the course‘ will be
offered.

In the past, course descriptions
often were compiled not by faculty
members but instead by depart-
ment chairmans, Baylson said. He
added that the new course
descriptions must be completed and
signed by no one other than the
individual teaching the course.

The course description revision
came about as a result of «another
SGB project concerning teacher
evaluations. Baylson said that any

Pitt student, particularly incoming
freshman, would need three basic
sources of information to make an
“intelligent choice” of classes: a
time schedule; an Undergraduate
Academic Review (available in
October, 1978 for use in the winter
term 1978) and an up-to-date and

A accurate course description.

The proposal for the new course
description was submitted to
Marshall who then shared it with

staff members and department_

heads.
Marshall said yesterday he is

Wilson photo

pleased with the new course
descriptions, adding that he has
continually urged faculty members
in the past to submit accurate and
detailed descriptions.

“In the past we have noticed
some irregularity and inconsistancy
in the faculty as far as the
submission of course descriptions, ’ ’
Marshall said. “We can only hope
that this might reinforce what I have
been urging the faculty to do. The
course description is purely volun-
tary so there is no way we can
enforce the obeyance of these
guidelines.”

The Elections

Student Government Board elections will be held next Wed-

nesday and Thursday.

Polling places will be set up in various

locations around campus, and students should have no difficulty in

finding a ballot box.

In the past, students haven’t exactly torn down the polling places
in eagerness to cast their votes. We hope that trend will end this
year. The Student Government Board can only be effective if it is
elected and supported by an interested and informed constituency.

There are campaign posters tacked, taped or pasted to nearly
every flat surface on campus, so the names of the candidates should
be familiar by now. The candidates’ positions on the various issues

are probably not so familiar.

In an attempt to alleviate this

problem, The Pitt News will publish individual interviews with the

candidates on Monday.

Our endorsements of one Plesidential

hopeful and four candidates for the board will appear on Wed-

nesday.

We hope students will not only take time to read the paper, but
to seek out the answers to any further questions they might have
about the 13 candidates. Preferences and complaints registered at
the polls are always more effective than post-election griping,‘ and
students can vote responsibly only if they put some effort into it.

Remembering King

Today, as everyone undoubtedly has noticed, we are celebrating
the birthday of the late Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Last year at this
time, we received several letters objecting to—-and in defense
of—this holiday. This year we have received none, partly as a
result of an overall decrease in letters coming in, and partly, we
think‘, because the controversyhas gone out of the day.

We are happy to see the continuation of a holiday honoring a
great American—especia-lly one so important to the black com-
munity. Ten years have not tarnished the memory of Dr. King.

Letters To The Editor

Pitt News Sports Section Growing Too Large

I see it happening again! As I ﬂip
through last term’s Pitt News, I see
the sports section growing and
expanding and encroaching upon
the “real news.” As a transfer
student from the University of
Oklahoma, (another number one
team——how many number ones can
there be?), I see the process
starting again. One might shrug off
a few more pictures here, a couple
of extra articles there, even an
occasional front page photo-head-
line. One might shrug them off as
editorial self-indulgence, but that
presumption could be dangerous.

The journalistic efforts of any
institution should and do act as a
barometer of that institution. It is
with that in mind that I protest the
burgeoning sports section. The
inference is that the Pitt population
would rather read an account of the
Notre Dame-Pitt game than an
incisive account of the news from
Oakland or, heaven forbid, the
world around us! I believe that is a
false assumption, and I get the
impression that there are a lot of us
out here who would like to be
intellectually stimulated, even
challenged, by a representative

press.

As I stated before, I have been
witness to this before; an institu-
tion, in the name of sportsmanship,
lets the scholarly community hang
in the race for the glories of victory,
the agonies of defeat in the arena.
Let’s at least give the impression
that the intellect is still alive on the
Pitt campus, through responsible
and responsive journalism.

Return N o Crowning Glory To Hungary

By DAN MULHOLLAND

This past weekend, we witnessed
one of the most shameful episodes
in the annals of American foreign
policy: the delivery of the Crown of
St. Stephen to the Communist
regime in Hungary. Ignoring
protests from thousands of Hun-
garian-Americans and others, the
Carter administration presented
this hallowed symbol of Hungarian

freedom to dictator Janos Kadar, ‘

betraying the sacred trust vested in
this country over 30 years ago.
The Crown was bestowed on St.
Stephen by Pope ‘Sylvester II in AD
100, as the symbol of Hungary’s
freedom and sovereignity. It
survived wars, revolution, and
natural disasters until 1945. Then,
as marauding Russian troops were
pouring across the Hungarian
border, a handful of Hungarian
patriots managed to smuggle the
crown behind American lines,
where it was presented to troops

under the command of Gen. George
S. Patton. The Hungarians asked
the Crown be kept in trust by the
United States until the Government
of Hungary was once more
independent, and possessed the
legitimacy conferred on it by the
people. Our Government agreed
and, until very recently, the Crown
was kept under heavy guard at Fort
Knox.

The regime that has ruled
Hungary since the end of _the war is
anything but legitimate or indepen-
dent. Free elections have yet to be
held, and the slightest bit of dissent
is quickly snuffed out. In 1956,
when, the people of Hungary
asserted their independence and
vied for the basic right of self
determination, they were ruthlessly
subdued by the Russian army. The
valiant freedom fighters fought to
the last, using sticks and clubs to
battle tanks, while a hand-wringing
“free world” stood by and did
nothing. As the years went on,

many of the Russian troops were
removed, but the repression still
continued under Russian puppet
Kadar. Religious persecution was
especially vicious. For years,
Cardinal Mindszenty, Primate of
the Roman Catholic Church, was
imprisoned under the most. brutal
and degrading conditions. The
long-suffering perseverence of this
modern-day saint _proved an
inspiration to millions around the
globe. On several occasions, the
Communists demanded the Crown
be returned as ransom for the cleric.
Lest they be accused of favoring
one religion over another in their
persecutory endeavors, .116 secret
police arrested three Methodist
ministers in September 1977,
charging them with conducting
clandestine church services.
Despite‘ all of this, in November
President Carter announced
through the State Department that
the Crown would shortly be turned
over to the Communists. This is the
same Jimmy “I’ll never lie to you”
Carter, who during the 1976
campaign assured Hungarian-
Americans the Crown would not be
returned until free elections were
held. The announcement came
after 5 p.m. on the day Congress
was to go out of session, to prevent
any interference with the planned
surrender. Nevertheless, a handful
of congressmen and senators, led
by Rep. Mary Rose Oakar of Ohio,
sued to block the move until
Congress could pass on the matter.
Unfortunately, their attempts were
thwarted by the Supreme Court,
and the Crown was taken to
Budapest last Friday.
This betrayal by a President who
claims to be the champion of human
rights, and who moralizes to the

point of self-righteousness at
almost every public appearance, is
sickening to behold. But even
bigger sellouts are in the works.

The administration currently is
gearing up for an all—out effort to
secure ratiﬁcation of the proposed
Panama Canal treaties, which will
surrender that vital waterway to a
tinhorn Marxist dictator who is
openly hostile to the United States.

And the selection of former
Communist and security risk Adam
Yarmolinsky to aid Paul Wamke at
the SALT talks portends even more
giveaways in the realm of strategic
armaments. It seems Mr. Carter
and his friends at Foggy Bottom are
not content with betraying our
national honor; they are dead set
upon dismantling our national
defense as well.

Amateur Fencing Competition

A

The fencing competition recently
held at Pitt for the physical
education class was a very notable
accomplishment for the students.
Never having fenced before Sept-
ember, in competition with very
experienced collegiate fencers, they
held their own. Also, their
opposition has traveled extensively
to other schools, which helps
develop the best in fencers. Yet
after only two months of group
instruction, their performance ex-
celled, mainly due to their
enthusiasm for the sport.

Kevin Haffey’ s recent letter titled
“Foiled Again” gives a grossly
false impression. He makes it
appear that the only thing the Pitt
fencers have to do is to go to the
AFLA Divisional or Collegiate
competitions, while it is true that
many fencers in the Pittsburgh area
compete with little or no instruction;
their losses show it. Few of them
compete at the regionals and
Nationals. On the other hand, the
local colleges limp by with the
physical education department
having one of the staff teach fencing
and basketball and tennis and
squash and...Their fencers’ record
demonstrates the inadequacy of this

course of action.

True, any fencer can go to these
local competitions on their own. It is
also true that many may never
develop into champions due to lack
of qualiﬁed and competent in-
struction.

The Pitt fencers simply do not
understand that they were doing
anything other than engaging in a
competitive sport and perhaps the
writer who sought to denigrate their
efforts is the only one who would
understand the motive for having
written so.

Saturday Night Fever
Directed by John Badham

“Saturday Night Fever,” John
Badham’s disco production, is one
of those ﬁlms a person likes or
hates. There doesn’t seem to be an
in between opinion on this movie,
which gives Kotter’s sweathog,
John Travolta, his starring debut
on the big silver screen.

The movie might have been one
of 1977’s biggest ﬂops, had it not
been ‘ for the hype put into

dvertising it on TV months before
its premiere. That, combined with
the popularity Travolta had alreadv

built, may enable the movie to ride
in on “Rocky’s” coattails as one of
the year’s best.

“Saturday Night Fever,” long
and at times boring, offers a view
of backstreet life in the Big Apple.
The superb music performed by the
Bee Gees is vital to the success of
the movie, but it should not be the
sole reason for seeing the ﬁlm.
There is a message, although
director Badham has difficulty
expressing it.

Tony (John Travolta) is the
Rocky of his neighborhood——not in
ﬁghting but in disco. With his
dancing and good looks, all the
women in the ﬁlm want to dance
with him and go to bed witlLh_ig_(9_1;

;‘Saturday NightFever” -- Good

in this case, go to the back seat of

the “community” car with him).
The life and surroundings of Tony
are crude and vulgar, but so is life
on the streets.

Then along comes Stephanie
(Karen Lynn Gomey), and Tony’s
life gets a facelife. She is the local
chick who made it out of the slum.
She went to school, got a good job,
and moved into the middle class.
Tony is at ﬁrst infatuated with her
and her excellent dancing, and of
course he wants to seduce her, but
ﬁnds her pseudoclass to be a
roadblock.

While Tony is attempting to
impress Stephanie, the couple
iecides to enter the disco contest at

the local club. Meanwhile, Tony’s
brother, Frank, decides to leave the
priesthood, and disgraces his
proud Italian-Catholic family. Tony
and his buddies get involved in a
gang ﬁght (no movie about life on
the streets of New York would be
complete without a gang fight.).
There, also is the self-destruction of
the girl who worships but is
ignored by Tony, dates and
frollicing on the high bridges of the
city, and the death that brings Tony
to realize there are things in life he
doesn’t know about, and that a
woman can be a friend, not just a
sex partner.

Panthers Preparing For Legitimate Contender ,,

By not; LABRIOLA

Pitt News Staff Writer

The Pitt Panthers get a chance to
step on the same wurt with a
legitimate contender for the
national championship when the
Syracuse Orangemen pay a Visit 1:0
the Field House Saturday for an 8
p.m. game.

Coach Jim Boeheim (winner of
Eastern Coach of the Year honors
last year) brings a team to
Pittsburgh that defeated Tennessee
in last year’s NCAA Tournament
before bowing to UNC-Charlotte, is
ranked in the _top ten in both Wife
service polls (eighth in AP; ninth in
UPI) and has been in post-season
tournaments the past seven years.

The Orangemen mainly play a
man-to-man defense, with 6-11

sophomore center Roosevelt Bouie
(9.4 points, 8.8 rebounds per game)
discouraging opposing teams from
driving to the hoop. Syracuse also
likes to run the fast break, and with
thoroughbreds such as Louis Orr
(14.2 points) Marty Byrnes (16
points) and junior Dale Shackleford
it has been highly effective this
season. Characteristic of every
team that receives a national
ranking, the Orangemen play tough
defense, limiting the opposition to a
paltry 41 percent average from the
ﬁeld, while hitting 54 percent at the
other end of the ﬂoor.

Among the 12 victories Syracuse
has registered this season have
been decisions over Michigan State
and St. Bonaventure, as well as

championships in the Lobo Classic
in New Mexico and the Carrier
Classic.

In last year's game with Syracuse
played at Manley Field House, the
Panthers led midway through the
ﬁrst half only to see their lead
quickly vanish when Larry Harris
went to the bench after picking up
his third personal foul. After the

 

Orange took the lead, Pitt was
forced out of its controlled style of
play, and the game turned into a
rout, Syracuse winning, 96-74.
While the -point guard position
remains a question, Robert Hay-
good, coming off a ﬁne performance
in Wednesday night’s loss to
Temple, should see considerable
playing time Saturday. Haygood

had a perfect night from the ﬁeld
against the Temple zone, and the
Panther offense appeared to be
more efﬁcient while he was at the
helm.

Other keys to whatever upset
dreams the Panthers possess will be
in the defensive play of Wayne
Williams and the rebounding
strength of Sam Clancy.

Clancy has shown he can play
against a big name center, as the
freshman forward had a fine game
against Purdue’s Joe Barry Carroll
before getting into foul trouble.”
Foul trouble of any type on Saturda';\
will be disastrous.

“Syracuse is an awfully ﬁne
basketball team, which they have to
be in order to be ranked as high as
they are,” coach Tim Grgurich said.

Temple Owls Defeat Panthers 81-74



By BOB LABRIOLA
Pitt News Staff Writer
Some of the particulars may have been

different, but the ﬁnal result was the same;
the Pitt Panthers played giveaway again
Wednesday night at the Field House,
bowing to Temple in double overtime,
81-74.

As was the case

against

George

Pitt’s Wayne Williams...

Wilson oholo

Washington, Pitt was seemingly in control
of the ballgame, only to commit consecutive
mental errors that transformed a potential
8-3 record to a mediocre 6-5, while Temple
won its llth game‘ against only one loss.

With 3:57 left in the second overtime,
Wayne Williams put Pitt on top, 72-70 with
a 10-foot jumper, but things rapidly
regressed from there.

Following a missed shot by Temple, Pitt
forced the Owls out of their famous zone
defense, and it appeared as though the
stall, which led to the Panthers demise
against GW, would vindicate itself.

Terry Knight then stunned the crowd of
3,642 by taking and missing a jumper in the
lane, breathing new life into a seemingly
dead Owl.

After Temple’s Ron Wister converted
one of two free throw opportunities to cut
the Pitt margin to a point, 72-71, Williams,
who played brilliant defense all night,
intercepted a pass and his ensuing dunk
gave the Panthers a three-point bulge,
74-71 with 2:00 to play. Pitt would not score
another point.

Marty Stahurski took advantage of a slow

defensive setup by the Panthers, canning a _

15-foot jumper to cut the lead back to a
digit. The Owls went right into a full court
man-to-man press and Knight, trying to
force the inbounds pass, had it stolen by
Rick Reed(17 points, 5 assists) who dished
off to Tim Claxton alone underneath the
hoop, and the Owl was not only alive, but
ﬂying high.

“Once again we had too many
breakdowns at the end of the basketball
game,” Tim Grgurich said. “We made
three mistakes in a row; we weren’t tough
enough down the stretch.

“That was an individual choice on the
inbounds pass,” Grgurich said referring to
Knight’s turnover, “I can’t come in and
make the pass for him. I know we had
timeouts left though.”

It appeared as though the game might
not go longer than the regulation 40
minutes, as the Panthers trailed 64-61 with
30 seconds left to play in the second half.

Pitt was not ready to fold, however, as
Williams threw up a reverse layup while
being fouled by Bruce Harrold. The ball
hung on the rim, undecided whether to fall
through the net, several hands became
entangled in the cords vying for the
rebound, and then the ball trickled off the
rim. No goaltending was called, and
Williams went to the line for two free
throws.

Ed Plank, the official who made the
ruling, offered this version of the incident:

“I had the foul on number 30 (Bruce
Harrold) right from the start,” Plank
explained. “The ball looked like it was
going to drop through, and I started to
come around to signal the basket was good.
There were five or six hands in that net, and
there was no way to tell who they belonged
to. I do know that no one touched the ball
while it was on- the rim, so the basket was
not allowed. I guess I just made a
premature motion to signal the basket was

good.”
Williams missed the secondof the two

free throws, but Sam Clancy grabbed the
rebound and drew a foul from Claxton with
25 seconds left on the clock. Clancy coolly
converted both free throws to send the
game into overtime.

In the first overtime period, Clancy

‘continued his marksmanship from the '

charity stripe, making both ends of two
separate one-and-one fouls, giving Pitt a
tow-point lead on two different occasions.
Temple had one last chance to win the
game, but Clancy blocked Claxton’s jumper
and grabbed the loose ball necessitating the
second overtime.

Larry Harris came out of the locker room
to start the game as hot as a pistol, hitting
nothing but net on his first four shots, but
foul trouble kept the senior sharpshooter on
the bench for an extended period in the
second half. This turned a potentially great
performance into an average (for Harris)
13-point game.

Temple Coach.Don Casey was pleased to
escape the Field House with a win, no
matter how long his team had to play to get
it. s

“This is our first win here in three
years,” Casey explained. “It’s good for the
team to win the overtime games, especially
on the road. Pitt did a real fine job against
our zone defense throughout the game, and
we’re just lucky that Harris was on the
bench (with ﬁve personal fouls) at the end._
which meant we could stick with our zonﬁ

...looks for two.

‘mental lapses by Grgurich’s players.

lnoffensive Panthers Far Too Generous

To say that Pitt had three chances to vsin Wed-
nesday_’s basketball game with Temple would be very
wrong——not because the team should not have been
ahead at the end of regulation play and at the end of
each overtime period, but because of the numerous
chances it had during each of those three spans.

The mistakes that had some of the spectators
calling for Tim Grgurich’s head were the result of
Those errors
usually allowed Temple to escape obvious defeat, but
they did not lose the game. Those mental mistakes,
believed by some to originate in the throat, would
have affected the score because of their astounding
frequency, but they should not have affected the out-
come. What prevented Pitt from becoming a 7-4
basketball team was an offense that seemed to be

designed to generate one good shot every eight

minutes. ‘_ ‘_ _ _ , _
In the game’s first tive minutes, Pitt scored wnéi

six jump shots. Larry Harris hit four that average-.i
more than 15 feet in length. Wayne Williams in-
terupted Harris’s burst with a 22-footer, and Ed

 

Scheuermann, whose improvement has been
noticeable of late, began the game’s scoring with a
jumper from the middle.

But Temple soon found that Pitt, after that
brief but damaging spurt, could not move the
ball-——or its players-——in any fruitful fashion on of-
fense. And so the Owls settled into a safe zone and
watched the Pitt Offense play itsteam into a lie.

The only regularly active Panther whose
shooting can break a zone is Harris. Pitt fans may
allow recent history to stain their impression of
Pitt’s leading scorer, but opposing coaches know

Harris can wreck a team’s defense with several flicks
of his wrist.  7‘

And so when Harris gave Pitt eight early poi 
Wednesday night, Temple coach Don Casey called a
timeout and, he later said, “made some adjustments
in our zone.” What he probably did was tell his team
to worry about Harris outside and to be concerned
with very little else. And if that is what he told his
players, they listened.

Harris’s nex1—and last—score of the half came
with 2:19 remaining. None of his teammates did
much on offense, either. Except pass the ball often
and without results.

In the past, the individual play of some Panthers
has dragged the team to defeat. But several Pantl rs
played well against George Washington and Temple.
In some cases, the performances were as good as tit?’ .
were unexpected. The defense has been outstanding?"
In each game, Pitt outplayed its opponent. In each
case, the Panthers blew it at the end. Against Tem-
ple, in fact, they blew it in the middle, too-—almosi
every time they had the ball.

 ‘Panic-Stricken’
1”  Shines

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Call it a bad case of the freshman
jitters, or call it simple nerves.

Whatever it was, something was
making Pitt gymnast Myra Bach-
uchin nervous before her ﬁrst
collegiate meet Saturday against
Temple at the Pitt Field House.

“I was practically panic-strick-
en,” the freshman from Monessen
said. “I usually get nervous before
meets. That’s the way you get
psyched, but this was a different

ind of nervousness. I didn’t know
hat to expect.”

As it turned out, Bachuchi_n’s
fears were unfounded. Shaking off
the nervous feeling, the former
state high school champion won her
ﬁrst two events (vault and parallel
bars), and ﬁnished second in two
other events to clinch the all-around
honors (edging out yet another Pitt
freshman from Monessen, Bonnie
Tressler), and lead the Pantherettes
to their season-opening win over
Temple.

“You have to expect a girl in her
first college competition to feel

nervous,” Pitt women’s gymnastics
§:§aach, Donna DeMarino explained.

medalist and a 6-5 Danish center led

ﬁfth-ranked Old Dominion past the _

Tuesday night at the Field House.

Nancy Leiberman and Inge

respectively, in a game delayed
nearly two hours because of ﬂight

IRS-for-15 from the foul line to set
an OD record.

Despite the outstanding play of
the stars, the Pantherettes showed
a strong first-half performance but
problems developed when leading
Pitt rebounders Wanda Randolph
and Stephanie Stripling each were
charged with four fouls.

“The foul trouble really hurt
us, ’ ’-said Pitt coach Jean Balthaser.
“Without Randolph and, Stripling
we couldn’t get the offensive
rebounds. We had to take chances,
and that’s something you can’t do
against a team like that.

Pitt jumped off to an early lead

Randolph provided much of the
scoring.

“We played well in the first half

justiﬁed, -since the Pantherettes

Following Saturday’s competi-
tion, DeMarino should be familiar
with handling the freshman shakes.
“Fifty percent” of the team is
comprised of freshmen, she said.

“We have our share of freshmen
this year,” DeMarino said. “It’s
going to be hard for some of them to
adjust to college competition. For-
tunately, we have freshmen like
Myra and Bonnie (Tressler) who are
used to the pressure. I know Myra
has competed against international
competition in high school, so she’s
used to the pressure—but some of
the other girls aren’t.”

Bachuchin and the rest of the Pitt
gymnastics team face a tough test
this weekend. Friday, the

“I hope I’m not as nervous as I
was before Temple,” Bachuchin
said. “But, considering how good
Penn State is, I may be more
nervous this time than I was last

tough, too.”

NCAA Super-Division
Becomes a Reality

ATLANTA (AP)-—More than four
years after it originally was
proposed, the so-called super
college football conference ﬁnally
became a reality Thursday.

However, it turned out not to be
quite as exclusive as first thought,
with 26 schools added to the original

79 (which includes Pitt) thanks to an

amendment sponsored by the eight
eight Ivy League schools along with
Colgate and William & Mary.

But that total of 104 National
Collegiate Athletic Association
institutions could be drastically
trimmed as early as Friday, and one
NCAA official predicted it would
happen.

In a complex opening business
session of the NCAA’s 72nd annual
convention, the delegates ﬁrst
turned down a controversial pro-
posal to split the current 144 major
schools in Division I into Divisions
I-A and I-AA.

But after a lunch break, a motion
to reconsider was passed and the
“super conference” was sub-
sequently created.’ Pitt voted
in favor of the conference.

But the delegates also approved
the Ivy League plan under which a

replacement, Linda Lesnick, was
preparing to enter the game.

Mimi Senkowski scored two quick
jumpers to bring the Pantherettes
within two. Loefﬂer then made a
free throw on a Nissen foul, but OD

program of V 12 varsity sports
qualiﬁes a school for major division
status instead of a 30,000-seat
stadium and an average home
attendance of 17,000 in one of the
last four years.

Under that legislation, 25 addi-
tional schools that would have been
relegated to Division I-AA are now
eligible for I-A.

Those schools, in addition to the
Ivy League, are Appalachian State,
Ball State, Bowling Green, Colgate,
Holy Cross, Idaho, Indiana State,
Long Beach State, Ohio U.,_
Rutgers, San Jose State, Temple,
Western Micﬁxigan and W&M,
along with four members of the
Yankee Conference-Connecticut,
Maine, Massachusetts and Rhode
Island. The Yankee Conference is
currently Division II in football.

While the so-called super
powers-the Big Eight, Big Ten,
Paciﬁc-10, Southeastern, South-
west, Atlantic Coast and Western
Athletic Conferences, plus the
major independents——now have the
ability to vote their own destiny,
some two dozen schools they hadn’t
counted on have come along for the
ride.

halftime lead, 28-25.

In the second half, the Panther-
ettes started off well through the
ﬁrst 10 minutes, but OD gradually
pulled away. The tough Lady
Monarch zone couldn’t be pene-
trated and Stripling fouled out.
With OD leading, 47-34.

Pitt scored six straight points on
baskets by Debbie “Day” Lewis,
Loefﬂer and Senkowski to make the
score 52-40, but the Pantherettes
fumed the ball over several times
and made only two more baskets in
the game.

When Randolph, Welsh and Fry
fouled out, the OD offense took
advantage of the height factor and
piled on the points.

telephoned threat on the life of
Denver running back Jon Keyworth
to the showing of the film, said:
“The power of suggestion in things
like this is so great.”

The threat against Keyworth was
phoned Wednesday to the Bronco
headquarters in Denver.

Strict security measures im-
mediately were invoked by the
 , which plays the Dallas

  

championship.
The running back's mail was
intercepted and screened. A

security guard was posted outside

 wboys Sunday for pro football's

his hotel room. Denver officials
acknowledged that it conceivably
was the work of a crank but Fred
Gehrke, Denver. general manager,
said Ke_yworth was “a little shook

up.”

The two-hour movie, shown
nationally by ABC, was based on a
fictional Super Bowl at the
Superdome here and was saturated
with intrigue, sex and murder,
revolving around an attempt by
gamblers to ﬁx the game.

“It was a terrible movie,’ said
Rozelle. ‘‘I must say that I was
deeply concerned that it was shown.

Our office had no advance warning
of it until the advertising began
about a week ago."

Rozelle scoffed at the suggestion
he had vetoed instant replays on the
four giant screens at the dome of the
stadium because he wanted no
second-guessing of officials.

“Eighty million people will be
seeing these reruns on television,”
he said. “It would be foolish for us
to deny the priviledge to the live
customers if it were possible.

“There are two drawbacks. One,
when the screens are dropped, they
abstruct the view of about 20,000
viewers in the stadium. But an even
more important factor is the fact,
that CBS, which is televising,
insists that it diffuses the lights.
The network objected to it.”

Meanwhile, as Super Bowl visit-
ors began swelling this famed
Mississippi River City’s population,
Denver and Dallas players zeroed
in on the big game. Both clubs
seemed anxious to get on with their
confrontation, and were starting to
snipe as the countdown began.

Denver safety Bernard Jackson
ﬁred the ﬁrst salvo, demeaning the
Dallas corps of receivers. “I don’t

think they’re that good,” said
Jackson. “We played three teams,
Pittsburgh, Baltimore and Kansas
City, who have better wide
receivers than Dallas. ”

And, he might have added, the
Broncos beat all three.

But if Jackson wasn’t impressed
with the Cowboys’ catchers,
Dallas’ defenders weren’t exactly in
awe of Denver quarterback Craig

Morton. Morton is recovering from
a sore hip, and the Cowboys think
he is vulnerable.

“Craig looks bad,” said safety
Cliff Haris. “He looks like he’s
hurting on the ﬁlms we’ve seen. No
one is going to’ go out and
intentionally hurt him, but if he
takes a good, hard lick, what with
that bad leg and hip he has, he’s not
going to be in there’ at the end.”

The Broncos insist that Morton
has beneﬁted from the extra week of
rest between the American Football
Conference championship game
and the Super Bowl, and that he will
be 100 percent ﬁt by Sunday. He
has taken heat and diathermy
treatments here, but has partici-
pated in all of the Broncos’ offensive
drills and seems to be practicing
without discomfort.

That report, however, hardly
impressed Harris.
“It’s a lot different being out

there with a Harvey Martin
breathing down your neck and a
Randy White tugging at your arm
and your head bouncing off that
hard Astroturf like off concrete,” he
said. “If Craig carries the ball past
the line of scrimmage, there is no
way he’s going to finish the game. I
know he won’t rush. I don’t think
he’ll dare.”
