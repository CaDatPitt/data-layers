Education studentsto travel to Egypt

Andrew Shull
Staff Writer

A group of Pitt education students will
be headed to Egypt next summer, in-
tent on dispelling common stereotypes
of the Islamic world for their future
students.

The University Center for Interna-
tional Studies and the Consortium for
Education Resources on Islamic Studies
will be sponsoring a trip for 12 educa-
tionaand Arabic students to spend six

weeks in Egypt studying Egyptian cul-
ture and language. Though the speciﬁc
criteria for admission into the program
is still undecided, the goal of the trip is
to expose future school teachers to the
Islamic world.

Elaine Linn, the director of the Uni-

- versity Center for International Studies

who also serves as its secretary and
treasurer, said that she noticed a dis-
turbing trend involving education ma-
jors and study abroad programs.
“Education majors don’t study
abroad, and those who do typically

will be the ones who will be teaching
world cultures and Islamic studies,”
Linn said. She is also in charge of com-
munity outreach for the Consortium
for Educational Resources on Islamic
Studies. “That is why we targeted those
students.”

While in Egypt, the students will take
part in various classes with topics ranging
from Arabic language and gender roles to

world history. Even though the program is '
still in its preliminary stages, the main focus -

will be to break down stereotypes through

learning about Arabic culture and immers-
ing the students in the Islamic World.

The news of this trip couldn’t have
come in a more timely fashion. In
January, a popular revolution in Egypt
overthrew long time president Hosni
Mubarak.

Even though the protests in Egypt

a travel warning on Egypt. The ﬁve Pitt

-students that were studying abroad in

Cairo this past spring were evacuated
after the protests broke out.

Linn said that, should such a travel
warning be put in place for next sum-
mer by the State Department or the

University, the center would abide by

the recommendation’. Even with the
recent security concerns, they are mov-
ing forward with the program.
Matthew Sudnik, a history teacher
at Central Catholic High School, an all-

’ boys Catholic School in Oakland, went

on a similar four—week trip to Egypt in
the summer of 2009, an experience
he said had a profound impact on his
teaching. I

“.Students’ and Americans’ ‘Views
are often shaped by the images and
narratives portrayed in the media,” he
said. '

He pointed to the stockfootage of _

angry Muslim men burning ﬂags as a
common way that prejudice is culti-
vated. He also mentioned a common
narrative that he confronted in the
classroom about the Muslim Broth-
erhood that was repeated in the me-
dia coverage of this spring’s uprising.
The Muslim Brotherhood is Egypt’s
largest and oldest Islamic organiza-
tion, according to BBC’s website. The
movement, which began in the 1920s,
initially aimed to spread Islamic mor-
als, but it soon got involved in politics,
speciﬁcally to rid Egypt of British colo-
nial control and all Western inﬂuence.
By the 1940s they had as many as 2 mil-

I lion followers, and in 2000 the group

won 17 seats in the People’s Assembly
in Egypt. =

Today, the group leads public oppo-
sition to the ruling National Democratic
Party of former President Mubarak,
and has been one of the main triggers to
the anti—government protests that be-
gan inJanuary.. One of its stated aims,

according to the website, is to create a
state ruled by Islamic leaders under the
slogan “Islam is the solution.”

Sudnik said the Muslim Brotherhood
isn’t the violent organization that it is
made out to be. Instead, he compared
its members to religious politicians in
the United States such as former Penn-
sylvania Sen. Rick Santorum who was
often guided by strong religious con-
victions.

“Glenn Beck would talk about the
Muslim Brotherhood, so in the class-
room, I would have to teach and re-
spond,” he said.

John Werkmeister, a history teacher
from Penncrest School District near
Erie, said that the 2009 group had a
ﬁrsthand experience with the Muslim
Brotherhood. '

“We were supposed to meet with a
member of the Muslim Brotherhood,
and although it’s normally a secret so-
ciety, this guy was pretty open about
it,” said Werkmeister. “But a few days
before we’ were supposed to ‘meet him,
he got arrested.”

Both teachers said that this experi-
ence allowed them to confront more
‘ forcefully negative stereotypes about

the Middle East, and breaking down
stereotypes is something that,Linn said
is a goal of the2012 trip as well.

Werkmeister said that he has seen
those ugly stereotypes ﬁrst- hand. He
shared the story of a Sikh man living
in his hometown. Sikhism is a religion
that originated in India, and its follow-
ers wrap their uncut hair into turbans.
Werkmeister said that the man was of-
ten harassed because people thought
he was Muslim.

“He ended up cutting his hair and
taking off his turban because he didn’t
feel safe,” Werkmeister said. “When
you mix ignorance with fear, you get a
very dangerous pathology,” the teacher
said. ﬂ

Inventory not common among university libraries

Mallory Grossman
News Editor

Missing books seem to be a common
phenomenon among university libraries,
though some libraries arebetter at keeping
_V track of their inventories than others. ‘

An unknown number of Hillman Li-

brary’s6 million library books are missing,

and this is due to a hole in the University ,
Library System’s procedure-that does not ‘

always update the status of missing books.
It is unknown whether the missing books
are inuse somewhereinthe library, shelved
incorrectly or stolen.

In a Letter to the editor published earlier
this month, Rush Miller, the Director of the Uni-
versity Library System, said that inventories
are no longer routine activities for academic
libraries of this size. He said that a library has

i to be closed for an inventory to occur and it is
very time-consuming.

Since no inventory is taken, the Pitt’s
library system does not know how many

‘ books are truly missing versus how many‘

are reported missing. Penn State, Carnegie
Mellon and West Virginia University all try
to keep track of inventories in their main
libraries, but as has the staff at Hillman,
the schools’ librarians have found it to be a
_ difﬁcult, sometimes impossible, task.
Penn State’s Patemo Library at University

Park has around 6 million books, roughly
the same amount that the Hillman does.
Accordingto Ann Snowman, the associate li-
brarian, however, the library keeps an ongo-
inginventory of all of its books, bothlocated
and missing, in the library’s catalog.

“The catalogis our inventory,” Snowman
said. “There is no armual inventory done.
That would be impossible.”

Penn State has 24 campuses, each with
its own library. Some of the libraries do an
inventory, some do not, Snowman said.

Hilary Fredette, the associate university
librarian at the Downtown Campus Library
at WVU, acknowledged how hard it is to keep
an ongoing inventory ofbooks in a library.

“The Downtown Campus Library, where
I work, started doing an inventory about
two or three years ago, and it’s an ongoing
project going ﬂoor by ﬂoor,” Fredette said.

The Downtown Campus Library usesa
piece of software that scans the bar code
on every book and compares it to those for
the books listed in the catalog that are not
checked out. ‘ . .

“You can’t just count the books because
you have to compare the books on the
shelves to what books you should have,”
Fredette said. '

While Fredette did not know the exact
number of missing books at theWVU li-
brary offhand, she said that the number is

not very large.

The search process for WVU’s missing
books involves marking abook missing and
then marking it lost if it is not found within
afew months. Once a book is marked lost,
Fredette said the library administraﬁonhas
to decide whether to replace it or not.

Penn State’s Patemo Library has a com-
parable process for books that cannot be
found. .

“Ifwe go to a shelfand don’tﬁnd abook, V

we mark it missing,” Snowman said. “Sub-
sequent-searches are made and after a cer-
tain period of time and a certain number
of searches, if we can no longer ﬁnd [the
book], then we draw it from the collection,
and it is no longer represented in the catalog
or inventory.” . «

CMU’s Hunt library follows a similar
missing-book procedure.

Matt ‘Garﬁnkle, a student supervisor at
Hunt Library, said that the library system
does keep track of the number of boolm

‘ there, and anyone can search the catalog

to ﬁnd any book.
Garﬁnkle said that while employees do

not constantly checkto see whatbooks they I
have and don’t have, there are usually not .

very many missing. While he did not have
the exact number of books in the library,
he was certain that an inventory system
did exist. ‘ »

“Typically, what we do after a book is

‘ overdue for 30 days is mark it as lost. Af-

ter we search for the book three times, we
mark it as missing and order a new boo ”
Garﬁnkle said. ,

The protocol for missing books at Hill-
man Library is a little different. When a pa-
tron notiﬁes the lendjng desk of a missing

f book, theV1endi_ng desksends a status—check
formto employees inRoom 306. Room 306
employees help patrons ﬁnd books when
they do not knowwhere to look orwhen the
lending desk tells them abook is missing,It
is only afteran employee from the room can-
not ﬁnd the bookthat it is marked “missing”
inthe library system. .

However; a problem arises when stu-
dents lookingfor abook go straightto Room
306 instead of stopping at the lending desk
ﬁrst to see if abookis marked as “available”
or “missing.” In these cases, if Room 306
carmot ﬁnd the book, they do not ﬁll out
the status—check form, and the book is not
marked missing. . s

In a previous article in The Pitt News,
Fern Brody, the associate University librar-
ian who works under Rush Miller, director
of the University Library System, said that
an inventory of Hillman Library has never
been performed because it would be too
massive aproject. Based on their comments,
Penn State and WVU library ofﬁcials seem
to agree. . .

Miller and Brody declined comment onthis
story. ﬂ

Organ infected

Kidney < 1

Hepatitis C Association, a nonproﬁt organi-
zation dedicated to disseminating informa-

tion on hepatitis C, said that the blood test

for hepatitis C is “excellent” and that cases
likethisare rare. ‘

She speculatedthatthere could beasmall
window of time in between infection and
when hepatitis C would show up on a blood
test, which could be why the infected kidney
got through the screening.

She said that hepatitis C is a blood-bome
disease that has only had an oﬂicial name
since 1989. Before that, itwas only knownas
non-A non—‘B hepatitis, and doctors believ

. itto be benign. - “

Now itisunderstoodthathepatitisccauses
scarringonthe liver, and ifthatitpersists long
enough, it can cause cirrhosis. '

Simon went on to say that hepatitis C is
the most dangerous form ofhepatitis because
hepatitis A is self—remitting, meaning that it
can’t become chronic, and hepatitis B only
becomes chronic 10 percent of the time.
Hepatitis C becomes chronic 70. percent of
the time. _

But hepatitis Cis not always life.threaten—
ing, and since its discoveryin1989, treatments

' have been improving. Just last week, a new

drug was FDA—approved that treats chronic
hepatitis C, and Simon said that she expects
another drug to be approved shortly as well.
“This is the ﬁrst time there has been a
new treatment for hepatitis C in many, man
years,” she said. - I '

. Simon saidthathepatitis Cwas most com-
monly transmitted through blood transfu-
sions, although the blood supply has been
clean since 1992. Nowthe most common route
of infection is by contaminated needles.

Hepatitis C is only very rarely a sexu-
ally transmitted disease,  hepatitis B,
which is often spread sexually. Hepatitis C
is not found in sexual ﬂuids, so it can only be
passed on through blood transfer. ’

Unlike hepatitis A and hepatitis B, there is
no vaccine for hepatitis C. ' ‘

' According to the website for the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, 3.2 mil-
lion people in the United States are currently

infected with hepatitis C. a

Buses to
scan Pitt IDs

Mallory Grossman
News Editor

Pitt students will soon be able to use
the technology embedded intheir Pitt

IDs to board Port Authority buses —
pending results from a month—long
trial that began Monday.

The trial is the ﬁnal stage of develop-
ment for the new fare-collection equip-
ment. Three hundred Pitttstudents and
faculty who received an email asking for
volunteers are participating in the pilot
program. Although students from neigh-
boring school Carnegie Mellon also use
their university IDs as bus passes, Pitt is
the only organization involved in the Port
Authority study.

Instead of simply ﬂashing the IDs,
participants in the new system’s tri-
al will tap their cards against a bar
code reader when they board the bus.
The machine will make a single beeping
sound if a card is accepted‘ and will beep
three times if the card isinvalid. '

"Jim Ritchie, public relations direc—
tor for Port Authority, said results
from the trial are still inconclusive.
He is waiting on feedback from the
participants and bus drivers.

_ The projected date for the program
to go into. effect for all Pitt students
and faculty is Aug. 1.

College worth
every penny 

Defenders of higher education,
take note: We have more to worry
about than Gov. Tom Corbett. In
fact, if certain pundits had their
way, the university system as
we know it would be radically
downsized.

The value of a college educa-
tion has been under persistent
scrutiny —— if not outright at-
tack — during the past year.
First there was widespread talk
in outlets like The New York
Times and the Washington Ex-
aminer about college’s inﬂated
importance and the student debt
crisis it was bound to inspire.
Next there was “Academically
Adrift,” the book that declared
that 36 percent of the 2,300 col-
lege students its authors tracked
were bereft of “any significant
improvement in learning.” Now
making its rounds in the media
is the Pew Research Center’s
new report, which found, among
other things, that 57 percent of
Americans believe college isn’t
worth the investment.

It is healthy to question cul-
turally enshrined institutions
like higher education, but lately
this second~guessing has become
hyperbolic. As college students
and benefactors of the system
that’s supposedly failed us, we
feel it’s our prerogative to affirm
both the professional and intel-
lectual value of the university
experience. '

First and foremost, there’s
the issue of whether college is a
“good investment” from a prac-
tical standpoint. Although it’s
understandable that in our bleak

economic environment many ~

people view higher education
with more than a little skepti-
cism, its monetary advantages
are almost irrefutable: In 2010,
according‘ to the U.S. Census
Bureau, the median income gap
in annual earnings between col-
lege graduates and non—college
graduates was $19,550. Addi-
tionally, the Pew.Research Cen-
ter found that over the course of
a 40-year work life, the typical
college graduate earns an esti-
mated $650,000 more than the

average high school graduate. It’s
perhaps unsurprising, then, that
86 percent of Pew’s surveyed col-
lege graduates considered their

four years a sound use of time»

and money. _

This, however, says nothing of
the networking opportunities col-
lege provides. Many professors,
academically entrenched as they
are, boast extensive professional
connectionsiin their respective
fields, which they routinely work
to a student’s advantage. Pitt’s
Career Development ofﬁce, as
well, is a resource students can
exploit to similar effect.

Of course, college isn’t’ (and
shouldn’t be) valued just for its
economic payoff — if it was,
every university would be com-
posed solely of a law school, a
medical school and a business
school. Rather, universities like
Pitt provide invaluable — albeit
less quantiﬁable — life experi-
ences. Namely, college — as your
advisers and parents no doubt
promised you — is a_ time to re-
solve exactly what you’d like to
do with your life. Rather than
jumping immediately into a trade
you’ll soon discover doesn’t suit
you, you have four years in col-
lege to experiment in different
disciplines and decide upon the
one that best utilizes your skill
set.

We as Pitt students doubt-
lessly bring more than a little
bias to the table when evaluating
the merits of higher education.
Nevertheless, we’re confident
that the contagious university
bashing sweeping the media is
overblown. When students take
full advantage of college — and,
admittedly, many of them do
not.—— it becomes an unrivaled

opportunity for economic and 5

personal growth.

The real challenge, perhaps,
is ensuring that we motivate our-
selves to harness the resources
presented to us. It’s always pos-
sible to excel in a college envi-
ronment and lay the groundwork
for a successful career. Spurring
ourselves to do so is a different
matter altogetherj

A guide to post— Rapture life

when the Rapture occurred just ,

as Harold Camping predicted and
my 20—year—oldjewish self surpris-

And for all Pitt students who ﬁnd
themselves in a similar, soon-to-
be-perilous Earth-bound situation,
heed my words, as they might be
our only hope in this existentially
dark hour. ’

Getting formally rejected from '

neither should other unchosen Pitt
students. Instead of wallowing in
our collective doom, join me in re-
alizing our second chance.
Because human beings have so

thoroughly embraced the concept 0

MOUSTACHE COLUMN OF AMERICA

Bateman: Living the "sitcom dream

    

Oliver Bateman
Columnist

Do you know what’s funny? Sitcoms!

Yep, few things can get a room of
people going quite like the sound

of ham-handed witticisms punctu-

atedby the roaringthunder of awell-

mixed laugh track. .

A Do you know what’s not nearly as
 You, most of the time. Chanc-
es are, if you step back and exam-
ine your life, you’ll‘ discover that it’s
not nearly as interesting or Charlie
Sheen-ﬁlled as a sitcom. People don’t
hoot and ‘holler. whenyou enter a
room or ﬂush the commode, none
of your supporting characters are
Emmy—worthy and babies and dogs
don’t express their disapproval via
voiceovers by the likes‘ of Pauly Shore
and last season’s Bachelorette.

We here at the Moustache Col-
umn of America believe that needs to
change. You’ve spent way too many
years hunched over an Xbox control-
ler in your rat hole of an apartment,
and it’s high time you put yourself
out there. If you follow our simple
rules for sitcom living, the chuckles
will roll in like waves breaking on
the seashore.

First, you’ll need a catchphrase.
We know that “Hey daddy!” is still
available, so why don’t you start with
that one? It’s easy to use, it has broad
applicability and teenagers will love
repeating it to one another. Here’s a
situation where it could really come
in handy: ‘

Your friend: Dude, what’s the
score of the Timberwolves-Raptors
game? .

You: Hey daddy! , .

[Cue laugh track. The sides of
various people in the background
of this -scene begin to split.]

Your friend: What? What the hell
does that mean? I want to know the
score of this very important game

between two of the NBA’s most be-
loved teams! .

You (perhaps popping a cold
brew or lighting a spliff/blunt/etc.
(note to kids: Don’t do drugs!)): Hey
daddy!

[The laugh track continues to
build in intensity. Several windows
in the dorm room explode.] .

Your friend: Man, whatever. Kev-
in Love could be going for his 59th
consecutive and completely mean-

ingless double—double and 

You (triumphantly): HEY DAD-
DY! .

[The laugh track, now as loud as
a herd of jet engines, brings down
the entire building.]

Wow. With a catchphrase like
that, you’re sure to take the world
by perfect storm, much like George
Clooney in that movie “The Perfect
Storm.” However, as the Olsen twins

‘learned to their chagrin, you can’t

spend the rest of your life coast-
ing on a sweet line ——— you’ll need
an exciting ever—changing series of
love interests, too. We’ve written a
number of past columns about the
intricacies of tracking such people
down, so if you require more detailed
instructions, you can start by lookiﬁg
there. If you’re in a hurry,'though,
just cruise on over to Craigslist’s “Ca-
sual Encounters” section and post a
“Looking for sitcom-style love inter-
est; must be relatable and guy—or—girl
next door-ish” advertisement in the
appropriate section. b
Once your love interest is in place,
you can begin focusingonwitty ban-
ter and good romantic storylines.
These two aspects of the sitcom'go
together like a horse and carriage
and, if you handle them correctly,
you’ll_have hundreds of fresh oppor-
tunities to shoehorn “Hey daddy!”
into your scripts. Check out this ﬁne
example of how to develop a story
through hilarious dialogue:
Your signiﬁcant other: It’s been

two weeks. When are you going to
put a ring on it, buddy?

You: Heeeeeeeeeeeey daddy!

[The laugh track rips through
the ceiling, crushing your mini-
fridge.]

Your signiﬁcant other: Can’t yog

~ be serious for even a minute? I’m

trying to . ..
' You: Heeeeeeeeeeeeeey

Your signiﬁcant other: No! Stop
it! I can’t take this. All you do is play
the Xbox and say “Hey daddy!”
And where is that laughter coming
from?

You: Hey daddy, hey daddy, hey
daddy!

[At this point, although your
significant other wants desper-
ately to weep, the percussive force
of the laugh track has driven his or
her tears back into the ducts from
whence they came.]

Goodness, isn’t that relatable?
Isn’.t that something that’s been
more or less ripped from the few
headlines that haven’t been devoted
to the death of Randy “Macho Man”
Savage? No matter how you ‘slice it,
it’s certainly something that viewers
will understand and connect with.

As soon as you’ve internalized

these simple rules for sitcom living,

you’ll ﬁnd yourself leading an exis-
tence that isn’t nearly as horrible as it
once was. A steady diet of “Hey dad-
dy!” will numb the pain that used to
accompany caring about things, and
the canned chuckles will spread like
a pall over the coffins where we’re
going to put all of the people who
drop dead from laughter.

Phipps show goe

Natalie Bell
A&E Editor

Exceptionally dressed in green
ensembles, guests at a dinner
partyiwanders the lawn. Squirrels
and other small animals frolic
through the grass.

Except, everything stays still.
That’s because the people are
mannequins, and their outﬁts
are composed entirely ofleafy
greens. Designers created the
animals out of plants too.

Phippsconservatory is pro-
moting “green” in more than one
sense of the word, and this is one
of the featured exhibits, created
by Kolano Design.

It’s part of this year’s Sum-
mer Flower Show, entitled “Liv—
ing Harmoniously with Nature,”
which features eight local inte-
rior designers who decorated the
conservatory with displays made
with ‘sustainable materials like
reclaimed wood and resin..

“I think the conservatory is
headed more toward sustainabil-
ity education  [We thought,]
‘Wouldn’t this be the perfect place
to showcase all these sustainable,
renewable materials we’re‘using
in interior design?” said Jordyn
Melino, program coordinator for
Phipps Conservatory.

Phipp’s search for designers

Bill Kolano:

around Pittsburgh started last
year with a competition. Local
interior designers submitted
ideas for plant beds that would
showcase “green” or sustainable

' materials. For example, in one

exhibit, repurposed street signs
crafted into chairs by New York

artist Boris Bally. Behind the
chairs is a “living wall” designed
by Vicci Franz...

In another .room, colorful
blooms made from PVC—free fab-
ric, linoléum and resin smile with
mirrored faces at people walking
past. This display was designed

by Mary Olliffe of Devlin Archi— "

tecture.

Bill iKolano,fowner of Ko-
lano Design, designed the din— ‘
ner party displ/ay_ located in the
South Conservatory. ’Me’ne1bers‘_-
of his team Jon Withrow ‘and V
Lauren Gratchick helped bring

the designs to life. Hereferred
to the driedplant garments as
“hort” couture, or horticulture
couture. S

' The apparent theme of shades
of emerald, jade and other hues
of green was intentional. Kolano
wanted a restricted color palate,
which sometimes meant snipping
blooms from the plants that were
ﬂowering. -

Along with the dinner guests
is a garden made in the espalier
style — the same technique that
King Louis XIV’s garden at Ver-
sailles featured — and includes
peppers, beans and squash among
other edible fauna.

5‘We wanted to plan this for-
mally planted garden that was
beautiful and produced nourish-
ment,” Kolano said. . S.

Kolano designed the scene

with the growing farm—to-table
movement in mind. The designer,
who sits on the board of the in-
development Pittsburgh Botanic
Gardens, said that gardening has

popular hobbies in the U.S., caus-

It happens again in ‘Hangover’

The boys forget what happens and searchfor a friend — again.

Randi Alu
Staff Writer

“The Hangover Part II”
Directed by: Todd Phillips
Starring: Zach Galifianakis,
Ken Jeong, Ed Helms, Bradley
Cooper

Grade: A-

If you loved the ﬁrst “Hangover,”
you will also love “Part II,’’ be-
cause it is essentially the same
movie.

But that doesn’t detract from
the hilarity. The ﬁlm is just as
funny and entertaining in its re-
packaged form to those who have
seen the ﬁrst as it is to those who
have not. “Part II” is like an inside
joke to those who have seen “The

e Hangover.” Certain moments,

like when Stu (Ed Helms) asks
“Is it my teeth?” when he wakes
up, are especially funny to those
who have seen the ﬁrst movie.
The term sequel is tricky when
applied to “Part II.” This install-

ment does continue the narrative
of the first, but only by copying
its form. “Part II” does little to
advance the life story of the char—
acters — the plot simply centers
around Stu’s wedding this time
instead of Doug’s. It’s indeed a
raunchy movie, so prepare for
some groans from fellow view-
ers. ’

The story arc is almost
identical: The Wolfpack wakes up
disoriented and not able to re-
member what happened the night
prior. An important member of
the wedding party is nowhere to
be found, a small, uncommunica—
tive being appears, and some-
thing is wrong with Stu’s face.
The remaining members of the
group must try to retrace their
steps to locate the missing per-
son. And they have outrageous
pictures to review at the end.

The plot similarities don’t
really_ trip up the ﬁlm, perhaps
because the characters embrace
them — just making it another
joke that it’s “happened again.”

Mr. Chow, played by the come-
dic actor Kenjeong, has a bigger
role in “Part II” than in the first
ﬁlm, and his performance is pee-
your-pants funny.

“The Hangover Part II” is set
in Thailand, and rather than ig-

A noring the culture of the area,

the movie uses it to enhance the
storyline.. A Buddhistmonastery
is the site of Alan’s epiphany, a
strip club owner makes a com-
ment about child trafficking, and
the rolling power grid dysfunc-
tion drives parts of the plot. Alan
comically narrates demographic
facts about Thailand from speech
cards that prove useful later in

the film. ; ,
The soundtrack is another as-

set to the movie, and it definitely
adds to the bad-assery and gen-
eral shenanigans. ‘

Even though it recycles the big
joke of waking up memory—less
after a crazy night, “The Hang-
over Part II” delivers fresh laughs
to both newcomers and fans of
the original. I

“The Hangover Part II” has almost the exact same

Courtesy Warner Bros. Pictures
plot as its prequel, but this time the men are in
Thailand, searching for a different lost friend.

form acrobatic feats on it. a pair
of teasing lovebirds perform a
trapeze number, coyly grappling
forspace on the bar they share,
swinging from one another’s legs,

. arms and torsos...

“Totem” hasgorgeous im-
agery, between the performers’
dancing and the vivid costumes.
Each act is practiced to perfec-

tion, and the stunts often seem

to defy gravity.

The show culminates in a Bol-
lywood-style dance number that
includes all the performers.

One more thing many might

enjoy about “Totem:” the circus— 

like performance includes no con-
ventional clowns. The are humor-
ous characters that pop up — like

an overly styled and somewhat .

sleazy European tourist — often

have exaggerated features, but: -~

not clownishly so. There’s also a
“tracker” in a stylized mask and
matador costume — but none of
these people are actual clowns.
As those who have sat bitterly
at home as their friends without

clown fears frolic at the circus

will especially appreciate, Cirque
du Soleil is perfect entertainment
for all. I

Grade: A-

’ Withmainstream musicbecoming more

creativethan the standard pop song, it’s an
appropriate time for artists to experiment

fwyithvdifferent instruments and sounds
T to produce unique music. .In that spirit,

cellist and singer Ben Sollee created Inclu-
sions, which explores these possibilities
and provides listeners with a well-made
album. . _

Sollee begins his LP with a reflective
tone that portrays his sentimentalism.
Tracks such as “Close To You” often plead
to a signiﬁcant other, often shifting into

‘ romantic ballads.

But as the album progresses, Sollee’s

. songs develop, and his bleeding.-heart lyr-
A ics become independentand expressive of

other topics. Trackssuch as “Captivity”

V i make Inclusions a more conﬁdent repre- v

sentation of Sollee as a solo artist.

In this song, Sollee sings a duet with
female artist Cheyenne Mize'who comple-
ments his delicate tenor croon. “Captiv—
ity,” which plays toward the middle of the

T album, captures multiple thematic ele- _
- ments of Inclusions and represents Sollee’s

sound as a whole. b
Through the usefof many different in-
struments over the album, Sollee proves
his diversity and aptitude for musical con-
glomeration. He incorporates the guitar
and drums ing-hisgtracks, as well as the
banjo, saxophoneiand piano. 7 . ;
.. In “Embrace”  “Electrified,” Sollee

- focuses on variou-slstring instruments in

an attempt to make the songs dissimilar
to the others. Thesesongs have merit, but
they tend to break away from the other,
more mainstream tracks throughout the
album. They represent another side of

. Sollee’s music that he only ﬂirtswith in
_his other songs.

Sollee ﬁnishes the album with a slow,
banjo—driven song that mimics earlier
tracks and brings the album to a serene

close. His soulful music is original1y_devel- ,

oped and crosses many genres. Listeners
are left with a new respect for the.artist’s

tendency to experiment. I

“People are ﬁnding a new connec-
tion to where their food comes from, and
there’s a whole new interest in raising it

, and growing it and knowing what’s in it,

my hobbies is as a restaurant reviewer,
and so we’re very much in tune with how
people are eating, what people are eating
and the importance of the new farm-to-.
table movement.”

Phipps has become a part of this move-
ment with its Farmers at Phipps markets,
held every Wednesday fromjune through
October on Phipps’, historic lawn. Local,

certiﬁed organic farmers sell their produce 4

at the weekly event.

It’s just one in a number of ways that
Phipps is trying to encourage “green” and
eco—conscious living. Melino believes that
Phipps’ works can help inspire people to
do this. .

“I think what the show really does is

highlight those [sustainable] materials re-
ally well, but also highlight those in unique
ways, so you can kind of take that back with
you and say ‘I can do that too,’” she said.

Panthers No. 1 seed for Nationals

Steve Garﬁnkel I Assistant Visual Editor '

Fifth-year senior Eddie Peters pulls, or kicks off, for the Pitt Ultimate’s defensive team at a practice on Saturday.

Quick, which Pitt athletic team has
the best shot of winning a National
Championship? If you said basket-
ball, you’d be wrong. Too bad you
didn’t guess the Ultimate team.
Ultimate, commonly known
as Ultimate Frisbee, is a recre-
ational staple of college students
everywhere. But for the Pitt club
Ultimate team, which will be tak-
ing part in the 2011 USA Ultimate
D—I College Open Championships
this weekend, the game is any-
thing by casual afternoon fun.“We
have really high expectations for
ourselves,” assistant coach David
Vatz said. “We feel as if we have
prepared enough to win — that we
have the best players in the coun-
try — and we deﬁnitely think that

‘ [Nationals] is ours for the taking.

We expect to win.”
Vatz, a former Pitt student, is

an unpaid coach. Pitt’s Ultimate
team receives the same amount
of institutional support as most
club teams — ‘meaning the play-
ers don’t have the scholarships,

There’s a lot more to competitive
Ultimate Frisbee than just throw-
ing a disc.

The USA Ultimate website de-
scribes Ultimate as “combining
the nonstop movement and ath-
letic endurance of soccer with the

aerial passing skills of football.” ‘

- Ultimate is played on a 70-by-
4o-yard ﬁeld with end zones 25
yards deep. The disc is thrown

_ from player to player— with‘,
T ’ seven players on a side —— and

the players cannot run with the
disc. .

Athletes can only move one
foot, in a movement known as piv-
oting, while holding the disc. .

Ultimate players line up seven

. on seven and the cutting takes

place in a similar manner to soc-
cer. The object is to score points
by passing to a player in the oppo-
site team’s end zone like in foot-
ball. Substitution is only allowed,
after a point is scored.

Each point starts with the
teams lined up in front of their
end-zone lines. The defense then
throws the disc to the offense.

The disc changes possession A'

the instant it touches the ground,"
goes out of bounds, is intercepted
or when a player holds the disc for
more than 10 seconds.

Ultimate is played with 175-
gram Discraft discs + the official

discs of the sport. ~ 2.

No physical contact is allowed
and the game is self—ofﬁciated.
That is, players call their own
fouls.

Fouls and contact rules are
very similar to those in basketball
and usually fouls occur when two?
players are going for a disc and
one grabs an arm or makes too

NHL returns to Winnipeg

Greg Trietley
Senior Staﬁ Writer

Winnipeg is back on the sports map, baby! *
The Canadian city will soon be the proud
home of anNHLfranchise onceagain. True North
Sports 8: Entertainment might ﬁnalize the pur-
chase and relocation of the Atlanta Thrashers
by the end of this week, according to the Atlanta

1 Journal-Constitution. Ifthat deal falls through,

U—Haul trucks also circle the current home of
the Phoenix Coyotes. .

As NHL cities go, Winnipeg, Manitoba, will
surpass Edmonton, Alberta, as the coldest, Ot-
tawa, Ontario, as the smallest and Buffalo, N.Y.,
as the poorest

'You’ve probably heard the potshots about

Wmnipeg’s location, andthose have some merit.
By car, Winnipeg is 16 hours away from_both
Edmonton and Calgary, Alberta. The nearest
NHL cityis Minneapolis—SaintPaul, which is eight
hours south. .

Simply stated, Winnipeg is in the middle of
nowhere. It probably won’t be the most popular
place for Penguins fans to go on a road trip.

portunity.”

Winnipeg had the Jets for 16 years. They
moved to Phoenix and became the Coyotes in
1996 because, like in Quebec City, ownership
couldn’t sustain the business with a struggling
Canadian dollar, a 40-year-old arena and sky-
rocketing salaries.

The Canadian dollar is IIQW strong, and the
cap keeps spending tied to revenue.

Thejets didn’twin much, but they did create
the “White Out” in 1987, in which fans showed
unitybywearingwhite to games. Halfthe sports
world has adopted the premise, but franchises
have to be careful. The Jets franchise, now as
the Coyotes, has the term “White Out” trade-
marked. ‘

Sowhen Penn State rolled outits“White Out”
campaign in 2005, the Coyotes sent a letter to
the school about it, according to The New York
Times. The brilliant minds in State College then
tried to avoid infringement by trademarking
“Penn State White Out.” ‘

Ifthe Thrashers move to Winnipeg, this trade-
mark also means thatWinnipegcan’t use “White
Out” either. Only the Coyotes can. But nothing
canstop the returnofthe rally songf‘Everybody

More than anythinglkthe icy
metro ohs sounds ' e a great
place or a maximum securi

prison.

More than anything, the icy metropolis
sounds like a great place for a maximum secu-
rity prison. It gives off a Louis Sachar’s “Holes”
vibe, except you shovel ﬁve feet of snow daily,
not dirt. .

When Phoenix was the franchise du jour to
move north, Coyotes goaltender Ilya Bryzgalov
told Canadian journalist Paul Friesen that he’d
consider the Russian KHL before Winnipeg.
“There’s no excitement except the hockey,” he
said. “No park, no entertaining for the families,
for the kids. It’s going to be tough life for your
 y.!7

It’s an age—old question that the Inuit of Can-
ada’s Northwest often ponder: “What is there to
do in Winnipeg?” Apparently the city won’t be a
popular place for free agents like Bryzgalov be-
cause it doesn’t have the Louvre, parks (research
for next week: Does Winnipeg have parks?)) or
Broadway, which I hear are big draws for hockey
players. It only has the usual restaurants, bars,
schools, businesses, industries and places of
worship. But who bases his choice of residence
off that?

Winnipeg also has the MTS Centre, a 15,015-
seat arena built in 2004. It will be the smallest
venue in the league, but Canadian Broadcasting
Corporation studied the economic viability of
hockey in"’Winnipeg and stated that an average
of 14,500 fans buying tickets that average 75
Canadian dollars equals i‘a good business op-

Wear White Tonight,” which is simg to the tune
ofwang Chung’s undying opus “Everybody Have
FimTonigh ”

Jets merchandise still ﬂies off the shelves
— always respect a fan in a blue, red and white
Teemu Seliinne jersey — but Winnipeg mayor
Sam Katz said that the new team will start fresh
as the “Manitoba something.”

I sincerely hope not.

Should the move occur this summer, TSN
reported that the NHL won’t have time to adjust
the divisions. That means that the inexplicably-
not-called-the-Jets will play in the Southeast
for a season and will host Alex Ovechkin three
times. . V

Then after next year, future—not-called-Jet
Dustin Byfuglien will presumably play in the
same division as Roberto Luongo. Because of
this, I’m allfor switching out Wmnipeg’s old goal
song, “Taking Care of Business,” for “Chelsea
Dagger.”

The biggest gripe aboutWmnipegremains the
cold. January temperatures average 10 degrees
Fahrenheit. Yetwhen sources leakedthe Atlanta
deal lastweek, Wnnipeggers tookto the streets to
celebrate, and they did it without coats on.

Maybe the city’s notorious cold is as over-
hyped as Buffalo’s snow or Seattle’s rain, or per-
haps everybody in town is just that crazy about
hockey, and also ridden with frostbite. For the
sake of the league, I like to think the latter. I
