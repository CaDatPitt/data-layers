Hunt for Nordenberg’s successor resembles 1995 search

Danielle Fox
Staff Writer

Christine Dockey knew it was an
honor when she was invited to sit
in on a candidate’s interview with
the Chancellor Search Committee
as a student representative in 1994.

She had no idea that the can-
didate, Mark Nordenberg, would
be appointed the chancellor of tlie

University in 1995 and go on to lead
Pitt for the next 18 years.
“[Nordenberg] was on the spot,
and all the questions were at him.
He was answering smoothly, and
I thought he knew the University
well,” said Dockey, who graduated
in 1994. “He did a nice job, and I
guess the true result of everything
he said in that interview is what
he made come true in the past 18

years.” \

In June, Nordenberg an-
nounced that /he’will step ‘down
from his position to a spot on the
University’s/ Board of Trustees. He
will ofﬁcially retire at the begin-
ning of summer 2014, which gives
the Board of Trustees about seven
months to ﬁnd his replacement.

Stephen Tritch, chairman of
the Board, said in a statement is-

sued in August: “The single most
important task that the Board has

undertaken since the election of -

Chancellor Nordenberg is the se-
lection of his successor.” ,

In August, the University also
announced the hire of Storbeck/
Pimentel &Associates, a consulting
ﬁrm that specializes in senior—level

searches for colleges and universities.

In September, the University announced
the 26—member search committee roster
and the schedule of 14 search forums lo-.

cated everywhere from Pitt’s main campus .

to Houston, Texas. The open forums are
designed to obtain feedback from students,
alumni and faculty.

Although the University has expanded
since Dockey was a student, the 'new—mil-
lennial chancellor search has not changed
much from the ’90s one.

The previous search included open fo-
rums, a search committee with more than
20 members and an executive search ﬁrm
that assisted in attracting candidates to the
University. _

Ken Service, Pitt’s vice chancellor of
communications, did not know how many
candidates were interviewed in the 1995
chancellor search. 4

Richard Colwell served on the 1995
Chancellor Search Committee and isalso a
member of the current committee. Colwell

declined to comment on the 1995 search and
said that after 18 years, all the information
from the previous search is still conﬁdential.

But there is at least one takeaway: The
number of universities and colleges employ-
ing search ﬁrms, and the type of candidate
who eventually gets the job, indicates that
the present searchwill be more competitive
than the 1995 search. ‘

According to a 2012 study from the
American Council on Education, search con-
sultants assisted in 80 percent of university
searches for senior-level leaders conducted
between 2006 and 2011. Only 12 percent of
universities worked alongside a consultant

' in their searches between the late 1960s and

the early 1980s. This data shows an increase
of more than 600 percent.

According to Tritch, there are currently
13 other major universities, including mem-
bers of the Association of American Univer-
sities such as Michigan State University and
Ohio State, that have employed consulting
ﬁrms to ﬁnd candidates to become the uni-
versities’ presidents.

“It’s not just the number of other schools,
it’s the fact that we want to ﬁnd apersonwho

Michigan State University has also em-
ployed the help of Storbeck/Pimentel 8:

Hamos, vice president for consulting opera-
tions at Academic Search Inc. in Washing-
ton, D.C., said this partnership would most
likely not result in a major conﬂict for Pitt

candidates, and then, it’s a question of ne-
gotiation.”

‘ Search consultants help universities as-
sess what they are looking for in a potential
chancellor or presidenf and connect possible
candidates to universities. .

“The role of the search ﬁrm is not to
choose the next leader,” Hamos said. “It’s
to support and inform the process with the
university as it selects the candidate.”

“It’s a combination of open public re-

cruitment through advertisement and
through tapping our networks and reaching
out to people who could either be interested
in a position like this or might know and
want to nominate a person who they think
might be a good next chancellor for Pitt,”
Hamos said.

Part of the search committee’s job was
to devise a proﬁle of the University that
included a job description for the chancel-
lor position. The 19—page document was
released Oct. 1 and lists necessary qualiﬁca-
tions in A candidate.

“The next chancellor will have a proven
record of administrative leadership in a
complex environment,’-’ according to the
proﬁle. It also says applicants should have
terminal degrees, the highest degree that
can be granted in a ﬁeld of specialization.

The report instructs candidates to sub-

‘ rnit materials by Nov. 15. The document does

not specify whether the University is look-
ing to attract a candidate who comes from
academia or who is currently a part of the

’ University of Pittsburgh community.

EDITORIAL

COLUMN

Simon Brown
Columnist

The phrase “undergraduate re-
search” conjures an image of
precocious students measuring
and pipetting, staring wide-
eyed through their lab goggles
at a world of opportunity.

At -least, that’s the prevail-
ing image from Pitt’s webpage
dedicated to the now-common
practice.

The choice to predominant-
ly depict science researchers
is understandable. The under-
grad humanities scholar -——
buried under books of Foucault
at Hillman past midnight —- is
much less photogenic.

But the marginal position
that humanities scholarship
occupies in the expanding

researchers poses a serious
dilemma. While the unique’
conditions of research in hu-
manistic fieldswill require

dergraduate scholars, there
is no reason why universities
can’t do more to try. And Pitt
would do well to lead them in
the effort.

As a student with research
experience in the humanities,
I often encounter the inescap-
able question, “So, how do you
research? Do you, like, read a
bunch of_books?” This is per-
haps the most encouraging
response a budding young hu-
manist could expect after ex-
plaining his research project,
which is more often met with
g1azed—over eyes and a visible
urge to change the subject.

community of undergraduate-

new programs to support un- ‘

But to answer the question:

OPINIONS

Yes, we usually do read quite
a few books. But the content
of those books, and what re-
searchers do with them, de-
pends entirely on the field.
Literary scholars, historians,
philosophers, writers, artists
and all others working within
this rather broad category
work with different material.
What uniﬁes them in a research
setting, however, is the fun-
damentally solitary nature of
their work.

While the robust process
of peer reviewing, editing and
presenting form the social bas-
es of these scholarly communi-
ties, the relationship in which
the humanist spends most of
his or her time is the one-on-
one dialogue with a text, with a
medium or with him or herself.

This distinguishes the hu-
manities from the natural sci-
ences, in which the central
location of the laboratory
bringsthe entire spectrum of

researchers — from the lowli-_

est undergrad lab assistant to
the tenured senior research-
er —-— together in one shared
space. .

Considering these starkly
different settings, it makes
sense that undergraduates
more easily enter the social
space of the scientific labora-
tory. With its built-in hierarchy
of professionals, interacting
with those directly above and
beneath themselves, it pro-
vides optimal support for the
undergrads who, ideally, will
one day direct the operations
of those labs. Undergrads can
benefit from contacts with
their PIS —— Principal Inves-

Give credit Where it’s due: Humanities‘
research both signiﬁcant and imperative

tigators —— whose shoes they
may ultimately fill in years to
come.

L, Whaf is more, the diverse
duties of different lab re-
searchers allow the entering
undergraduate to work at
a level suitable to his or her
skill. Though they may begin
by assisting in the day-to—day
technical operations, they can
graduate tojindependent re-
search responsibilities and, fi-
nally, to self—designed projects.

This arrangement, however,
is not often available for the
future philosopher, historian,
critic or artist.

Considering the individual
nature of the humanist’s work,
it’s understandable why under-
graduate research programs
— including Pitt’s — have dif-
ficulty attracting such schol-
ars willing to include student
proteges within their own
projects. It is not always easy
to imagine how a sophomore
or junior could meaningfully
contribute to, say, a paper on
the irreducibility of the mind
to the brain, or to archival re-
search in documents written
in 12th-century French.

So the first experiences of
an undergraduate humanist
must often differ from their
peers in thesciences. Rather
than finally graduating to the
self-conceived project, the hu-
manist typically begins with
one.

While this may prove par-
ticularly rewarding for some, it
can also intimidate any sopho-
more trying for the first time

to navigate the dense and perplexing

tions for this work can sometimes drive
prospective humani_sts from pursuing
meaningful and rewarding research.
To counteract this, undergraduate
research programs have to design par-
ticular opportunities for undergradu~
ate humanists. They can begin by end-
ing the reliance on faculty members
to include students in their research
projects. Since their work is not often
conducive‘to such a meaningful re-
lationship, they should rather be re
cruited to fulﬁll their role as a mentor

to students’ original work.

But most of all, student researchers
in the humanities —— along with their
peers in all ﬁelds — should be given
ample opportunity to present their
progress, their methodologies and
their difficulties to colleagues within
their fields. The support network of
fellow students and experienced faculty
can help encourage students frustrated
by the new demands of independent
research; .

What is more, this could help faculty

5

to stay aware of the often impressive
work of their own undergraduates,
which they may not see in the narrow
conﬁnes of the classroom. ‘

Someone could enumerate all the
differences and similarities between re-
search in the sciences and the humani-
ties and comment on how a university
might make both subject areas available
to its undergraduates. Who knows, it
might make an interesting topic for a
research project. I

V For more than 50 years Asia liasbeen thought of as a backwater in the human
evolutionary story, being largely peripheral to the main game in Africa and Europe.
Discoveries over the last decade, however, have begun to dramatically challenge

this view. This region seems to have been home to a wide variety

of late surviving human-like groups — species different to us --
with Asia showing even greater diversity than Africa or Europe
during the last Ice Age. some of these groups shared the
environment with our owmkind (modern humans), interacting
in complex and surprising ways. it's even likely that we

sent the last of these close relatives to extinction as our

species began to settle down and develop farming. This

talk will present some current and highly controversial

Asia made over the last few years. These discoveries

are challenging not only scientiﬁc orthodoxy, but also

established notions about what it meaosto be human.

Though there are many standout pieces at the Carnegie Internationai, the exhibition in its entirety lacks cohesion JeffAhearn | Staff Photographer

Grace Kelly
Stcyj’ I/Vriter

The Carnegie International has ﬁnally ar- ‘

rived after three years of planning and ex-
tensive and varied installations. The pieces,
representing the efforts of 35 artists from 19
different nations, are displayed in myriad
ways throughout the Carnegie Museum of
Art — each room entirely different from
the one before it.

Although the effort invested in organiz-
ing the Carnegie Intemational is worthy of
applause, the exhibition in its entirety gives
off a sense of stale, stagnant contemporary
art that seems to lack any cohesiveness or
ingenuity.

I’m not saying the art itself is stale or
bland, but the selection and arrangement is
disjointed, random and lacks a real empha-
sis. Eyery work is a critique of society in one
form or another, states a political or social
message or tries to “involve” the viewer.
These are hardly new themes, and these
themes mostly trace roots back to post—mod—
ernistic tradition — a sort of iconoclastic,

politically charged and collaborative-based
art heritage.

The exhibition’s artwork has this com-
mon heritage, but none of the works directly
relate to each other, and the hectic juxtapo-
sitions between them and the permanent
exhibition lack a strong uniting theme be-

sides the fact that they are contemporary’

and _international.

The idea of play is a key component of
the exhibition, and although there are some
cohesive hints of this idea with the outdoor
playground, an indoor playground exhibit
and a puppet theater, it still feels like a feeble
attempt to make art “accessible” or “under—
standable.”

Yet there is a disturbing contrastbetween
the works of “The Playground Project” ex-
hibit and the works in the nearby Hall of
Sculpture. The Hall of Sculpture houses
Pedro Reyes’s instruments constructed
out of recycled guns fromjuarez, Mexico, a

city notorious for its violent crime,, steamy I

pulp—ﬁction novels and paintings by Nicole
Eisenman that are saturated with themes of
our lavish, hedonistic culture.

This atmosphere seems an odd place to
end up after being in an exhibition focused
on children and creating diverse and toler-
ant areas of play. This is hardly “understand-
able art” for the intended child audience that
is close at hand.

Although the exhibition has some serious
ﬂaws, there are some redemptive qualities.
For example, outside the actual museum,
Phyllida Barlow’s “TIP” has a dynamic en-
ergy that the rest of the exhibition lacks. The
C0l0I'ﬁ.ll, chaotic structure that appears to
grow out of the glass facade of the museum’s
front draws the viewer into the throes of the
museum. There is a dynamic relationship be-
tween “TIP” and Richard Serra’s preexisting
giant steel work — titled “Carnegie” — that
is also situated just outside the museum’s

front doors: The colorful timbers of “TIP” ‘

wrap around a solid, angular structure in a
manner that borders on organic. There is
also a dynamic, noncombative and (hitting
upon the Carnegie’s interest in play) playful
sense of awe created by this work. As Curator
of Education Marilyn Russell noted, “Phyl—
lida Barlow transforms the entrance of the

museum, creating a work that, like bread-
crumbs, leads the viewer into the museum.”

Another piece in the exhibit that Russell
enjoyed was the Gabriel Sierra work, which
emphasizes certain areas in the Hall of Ar-
chitecture with a Minnesota Vikings—purple.
“I really like the Gabriel Sierra installation,”
she said “It is a subtle intervention honed in
on a sense of space and changes the aware-
ness of the sense of space.”

It seems to me that the works that deal
with these subtle — or even grand (in the
case of Phyllida Barlow) —— spatial interven-
tions, while perplexing, may create the best
realization of the curator’s themes of beauty,
imperfection and conﬁision. They develop
a more complete relationship to the viewer
because the viewers can actively engage with
the work in the space. Although this is a
positive thing, there is still a tendency for
the museum-goer to question, “Well these
purple walls are cool, but  what does it
mean!?” ' <

“Have a safe trip.”

This simple farewell is spoken to loved
ones nearly every time they leave on a ﬂight
or a trip. It’s what Captain Richard Phillips
(Tom Hanks) was told by his wife, Andrea
(Catherine Keener) before he embarked on his
voyage aboard a cargo ship" sailing to Mom-
basa, Kenya. Little did she know how unsafe
his journey would be.

“Captain Phillips” tells the gripping, true
story of the Maersk Alabama, a U.S. ship
that was hijacked by Somali pirates in April
of 2009. More speciﬁcally,’ this ﬁlm tells the
heroic tale of the ship’s captain, Phillips, and
his efforts to hinder the attack on his ship
and crew. V ’

not only himself, but his entire crew.

The ﬁlm was inspired by a book written\

by the real Richard Phillips titled, “A Captain’s
Duty: Somali Pirates, Navy SEALS and Danger-
ous Days at Sea”, which documents the entire
ordeal from the captain’s perspective.

Early on in the ﬁlm, Phillips is character-
ized as afarnily—ﬁrst man who lives in a small
suburban home. This is evident from the
coffee mug that has a picture of his wife and

kids on it, the fact that he drives a minivan '

to the airport and how he worries about his
children’s grades with his wife.

These images are quickly juxtaposed with
shots of life in Somalia. There, teenagers are

p carrying guns and the only value people have

is making the most money possible with no
regard for anyone else, according to the ﬁlm.
This is evident by the cruelty seen in the So-
malian community, where neighbors push
and curse at each other as they all vie for
spot aboard the pirating crew. -

Captain Phillips is an unquestionable au-T

thority ﬁgure. He has complete command
over his crew, and deservedly so, as his actions
assert that he knows what he is doing. This
includes communicating with his superiors
during an initial unsuccessﬁil attack by the
pirates, alerting them of what is going on and
ensuring that he and his crew stay as safe as

I knew that I’d begin dreading getting older

For the ﬁrst decade or so of my life, each

one day (well, two really —— one of the many

year that, for whatever reason, forced ev-

me things that I had apparently earned by
continuing to exist. Those factors, com-
bined with the fact that getting a year older
feels sort of like leveling up, made growing
up the third—best occurrence each year —
right behind Halloween and Christmas.

Finally, 21 arrived, and with it the ability
to legally imbibe and pretend that I was a

full-ﬂedged adult.

However, with this new age came an-
other, ‘fairly unexpected, burden — I’Ve
ﬁnally reached the age where there are
incredibly talented musicians, actors and
athletes younger than I am.

Nothing punctuated this new revelation
more than the barrage of album releases
this past summer. I helplessly watched as
Earl Sweatshirt (age 19), Chance the Rap-
per (age 20) and King Krule (age 19) all
exploded onto the music scene with ut-
terly spectacular albums that displayed, not
just potential but polished talent that had
presumably beenvdeveloped while I was
humming around reading comic books and
trying to ﬁgure out how to work a stick shift.

Though the Miley Cyruses and Justin E

Biebers of the world had been around for
a long portion of my teenage years, their

The pieces in the exhibit varied in style.

evansky explained to me, the idea behind
the physical layout of the exhibition was
based on the supposition that “people un-
derstand things chronologically, I think.”
“So with the way we arranged the work
chronologically, I think there is a better
chance of the work being understood 
People need a lot of help understanding
contemporary art,” Zelevansky said.
Zelevansky’s last sentence says a lot.
The selection is varied and international
— a veritable global-art goldmine glitter-

. ing incandescently in the trained eye of the

curator, art historian or artist. But to the
common folks, Sierra’s painted walls are
just purple walls, and the whimsical land-
scape maps ofjoseph Yoakum — with their '
strange proportions and shifting, snaking
dimensions —— are essentially big doodles.
That being said, the Carnegie Interna-
tional is not a bad art exhibition. It shows
avariety of artwork from a diverse array of

surplus of post-modérnistlmessages and ' —

giant gaps between art and observer.

Perhaps the best example was a moment '

I witnessed when walking up the stairs to
the Carnegie Museum of Art’s Scaife Gal-
leries, where a bulk of the 2013 Carnegie
International exhibit is located. I came upon
a trolley laden with folded chairs stacked
in all manners _— a sort of twisted mass

of metal —— with a bright purple crate on

top, like a cherry on an ice cream sundae.
Members of the press and museum visitors
gathered around the structure, which was
located across from a ﬁlm piece by Mark
Leckey that celebrates the relationship be-
tween artist and art.

What could this piece mean? I heard
frantic whispers from well—dressed couples
discussing the hidden gestures inherent
in this work, this existential, spatially dis-
rupting piece that challenged notions of
material, space and color. “Oh, how grand
contemporary art is,” they exclaimed, “and
we, humble plebeians, can actually under-
stand it.”

Then, curator Dan Byers walked up
with a look of surprise on his bearded face,
whipped out his cell phone and called main-
tenance to reinove not an art piece, but the
misplaced conglomeration of chairs and
crates meant for the storage closet, not the
gallery. The small crowd dispersed, quickly
forgetting this unintentional, unnamed
work, and went on to discuss and analyze
the real art.

To me, this was the most interesting in-
teraction that the museum offered. Perhaps
the janitor who left the trolley and chairs
should be heralded. He or she managed to
create a work that perplexed not only the

viewers, but the curator, as well. I _

possible. HE also displays his authority in giv-
ing commands to his crewwhen he anticipates
another attack, instructing them to hide in
the engine room silently should the pirates
successfully board the ship.

This leadership is put to the test when a
group of four armed Somali pirates, led by
Muse (Barkhad Abdi), board the ship with
intentions of stealing all its money and cargo.
They are willing to do anything to get it —

' including kill.

Shouting, violence, intense close—up shots
and silence all contribute to the tension-ﬁlled
scenes aboard the ship, in which Phillips at-
tempts and mostly succeeds in operating
smoothly under pressure — all while a gun

‘ is held to his back.

Joint efforts from Phillips and some trust-
worthy crewmembers lead to the capture of

Muse, as well as the injuring of another pi— .

rate. The Somalis agree to leave on the ship’s
lifeboat with $30,000, not a large amount
for pirates, since most of the money goes to
their long chain of higher-ups, and Muse is
to be exchanged with Phillips — captain for
captain, hostage for hostage.

Instead, the pirates trick the crew and take
Phillips with them on the lifeboat in an effort
to get more moneyas aransom for the captain.

Hanks’ performance reaches a new level while .

on the lifeboat. He perfectly characterizes the

emotions a hostage would feel, including fear,
tension, pain and helplessness.

The ﬁlm does an excellent job of showing
the pirates’ desperation while not evoking
much, if any, pity from the viewers. The ﬁlm
makes it clear that these Somalis don’t have

V much choice but to engage in piracy because

of their country’s impoverished conditions.

Phillips himselfnotices this desperation when - 1

he realizes one of the pirates can’t be older
than 16.

Barkhad Abdi’s character embodies the
desperate, but ntentally and physically tough,
lifestyle that extends to all Somalis featured
inthe ﬁlm. Abdi’s ﬁlm debutwill certainly not
go urmoticed, as his emotional performance
is on par with that of Hanks.

The climax of the ﬁlm is Phillips’ rescue
by the U.S. Navy. Shot at sea and at night, the
choppy camera, representingthe choppiness
of the water, the darkness that creates shad-
ows and dim lighting, as well as the images
seen through night—vision goggles all add to

I an intense rescue sequence that will not only

make its viewers appreciate the U.S. Armed
Forces, but keep them captivated and rooting
for Phillips the whole time.

Though the plot of the ﬁlm is well—known,
actually seeing it unfold on the screen is an
experience worth seeing, especially for any-
one who remembers this event from 2009.
Captain Phillips is a true hero, and his story’
is one that will live on through this ﬁlm for
years to come. I '

emergence of the aforementioned trio of
artists.

After all, Bieber and Cyrus were child
stars. The world always needs more child
stars, and their meteoric rise to the top of
the pop charts and the stages of sold—out
arenas could always be chalked up to the
workings of a music industry that makes
bank on kiddie—pop idols. I was expecting
to spend the next year or so kicking back,
sipping good beers and basking in the warm
glow of schadenfreude as I watched them
both go the way of Macaulay Culkin. I’m
not proud, but I’d be lying if I said I wasn’t
excited about it.

judging from the recent antics of both
Bieber and Cyrus, this route may still be an
option for me. However, it’s impossible to
argue that the likes of Earl Sweatshirt or

King Krule are coddled child stars churned
out by the pop industry. Their music is too
original and their appeal has nothing to
do with age. ._
King Krule’s debut LP 6 Feet Beneath

-the Moon has the sort of contemplative

pacing and disconcertingly deep, emotive
vocals that would earn a middle-aged mu-
sician Artist ofthe Year consideration. It’s
an album that makes listeners turn to stare
at their sound system, and it makes their
jaws drop when they ﬁnd out that the cre-
ator is a 19 year old British kid who by all
appearances can’t grow a full beard. King
Krule isn’t great for a 19 year old — he’s
great, period.

So what’s a 20—something to do in a

‘world where some of his favorite albums

are being put out by artists younger than
he is? In all likelihood, we’ll all have to just
swallow our pride and pay respect to these
precocious artists that are shaping music’s
ﬁiture. ]

CHANCELLOR ‘

David Bartholomae, a search committee
member and Charles Crow chair of the Eng-
lish Department, broughtup the possibility at

_p the second chancellor search forum that the
next chancellor might not have a background
in academia.

Bartholomae wanted to know what audi-
ence members thought of the idea of a can-
didate who comes from an executive position
at a business organization instead of having
served at a university. _

This question was metwith slight appre-
hension from the audience, and it touches

. upon a growing trend in the selection of
higher—education-institution presidents.

_ According to a study published by the
American Council on Education in 2012, the
number of college presidents whose imme-
diate prior position was outside of academia

- increased from 13 percent in 2006 to 20 per— '

cent in2011. »

For instance, Janet Napolitano served as
the secretary of U.S. Homeland Security and
was a former governor of Arizona before she

became the president of the University of ‘

California lastjuly.

“A candidate who comes fromthe business
sector would need to respect the expecta-
tions of the people surrounding him or her
that work in higher education,” Hamos said.
“It’s also very much a question of their lead-
ership qualities and their ability. and inter-
est to understand the industry that they are
working for.”

Hamos added that the “skills and work
ethic of a candidate” are what qualify him or
her for the position. A

“It is clear that a lot of the skills that people

4! 42l~9346lDewery
40OSotxthCmlgSbee{Oddorx1
Monday-Stm3ayIam~%5pvn

bringfrom the leadership from business, the
military and other sectors are increasingly
in need in higher education, but that doesn’t
mean that they need to look for people from
any one sector,” Hamos said. K
b Although the actions of the search com—
mittee have been largely transparent so far,
Service said ﬁirther action after the forums
and response to the proﬁle must remain con-
ﬁdential. '
“The more conﬁdential [the search com—
mittee] will remain, the better chance they
have to recruit a top—ranked candidate,” Ser—.

vice said. “It is really important in terms of
gettingthe best quality of candidates, because
they lookfor conﬁdentially. Some of them may

‘ be employed by other places.”

Neither Service norarepresentative from
Storbeck/Pimentel 8: Associates could com-
ment on how much the search process will
cost the University.

However, current clients of Storbeck/Pi- A

mentel 8: Associates, including the Univer-
sity of Wisconsin, the University of Nevada
and ‘Kent State University, have made their
agreements with the ﬁrm public. Kent State

University also publicized a ﬁill list of how

i much each fee of its search process will cost.

The universities were required to pay a
service fee to the search ﬁrm that was based}
on one—third ofthe total ﬁrstyear’s cash com—
pensation for the candidate, with a minimum
of $60,000. Total ﬁrst year’s cash compensa-
tion includes base salary, bonuses and other
cash perks. _

' This charge amounted to $104,000 for;

Just more than 2 minutes remained in the
ﬁrst quarter of Pitt’s 58-55 win over Duke
last month, and the Blue Devils had a sec-
ond—and-1o from the Pitt 12-yard line. In
the red zone, Duke threatened to score its
ﬁrst touchdown of the game when they were
down 13-0. A ,

Aaron Donald had other plans, at least
for that snap. .

Donald broke through the middle of
Duke’s offensive line as quarterback Brandon
Connette and tailbackjosh Snead attempted
to run a read—option. Connette never had a
chance to read whether he should keep the
ball or hand it off as Donald tackled both
him and Snead — one takedown per arm.

Nearly a month later, Donald leads the
nation with eight sacks and 12‘ total tack-
les for loss. As a result, his name has made

and ESPN.

ESPN national college football analyst
Mark Schlabach took his praise of Donald’s
play a step further and tabbed the senior
from Penn Hills as one of his top ﬁve defen-
sive players in the nation from the season’s

ﬁrst half.

Donald has recorded atleast one take-
down of the quarterback in each of Pitt’s
ﬁve games, and he leads all active college
football players with 26.5 career sacks.

Donald’s latest performance saw him
sack Virginia Tech quarterback Logan
Thomas twice in a 19-9 Pitt loss. The two
sacks moved Donald into a tie for fourth

place all—time in Pitt program history with
his sack total, past NFL Hall of Famer Chris
Doleman and into a tie with Zeke Gadson
and Keith Hamilton.

Donald also leads the nation with 1.6
sacks and 2.4 tackles for loss per game.

As Donald makes his case for postseason
all—American rights, he is also on the watch
list for the Chuck Bednarik Award, Bronko

Nagurski Trophy, Lott IMPACT Trophy, Out-
land Trophy and Rotary Lombardi Award.
Each award honors prowess on the defensive
side of the ball, with the Bednarik going to
the best overall defender and the Outland
awarded to the best interior lineman.

Pitt hasn’t seen a defensive tackle named
as an all-American in over two decades, with
the last being Marc Spindler in 1989. I

tougher, in a good way. He’s put us in a

And succeed is what the Panthers
have done so far in their fall tournament
season. Heading into this week’s NCAA
regional tournament in Charlottesville,
Va., the Panthers have won four doubles
‘and two singles titles in just three tour-

-Jﬁaments.

When discussing transitioning from
Miami to Pittsburgh, Santos downplayed
the move.

“I’m teaching the same things. My
philosophies are the same,” Santos said.

“But each year, you always have to adapt
to your players.”

So far, that adaptation has been
smooth, particularly with the two true
freshmen on the team: Audrey Ann Blake-
ly of Wyomissing, Pa.,andlBritish recruit
Lolade Ogungbesan.

The two freshmen have totaled two
singles and two doubles titles this fall.
Their showings so far have impressed
other players and their head coach.

“I’ve been really impressed with
them,” Borza said. “For them to come
in and not only make an impact, but to
push all of us in practice — it’s been great
to see.” I

Santos cited the mature mindsets of

the underclassmen as a reason for their
success — this shouldn’t come as a sur-
prise, as Blakely’s two sisters were both
Division 1 tennis players and Ogungbesan
trained at prestigious tennis academies
in England.

But Santos also credited team veterans
such as Borza for helping Blakely and
Ogungbesan ease their way into collegiate
competition. ,

“Our upperclassmen have been doing
an incredible j ob pushing our underclass-
men and explaining things to them,” said
Santos. “They have put their arms around
the younger girls and have guided them.”

‘In a press release, Ogungbesan ex-
pressed her contentment with her team-

“I love all my teammates —— it’s really
true,” Ogungbesan said. “Sometimes I
just think about how lucky I am to be on
a team where I actually like everybody,
because I think that’s very rare.”

The team will head down to the Univer-
sity of Virginia to ﬁnish up its successful
fall season withthe ITA Atlantic Regional
Tournament. Although no draws have
been announced, Santos and the Panthers
are prepared for the tournament.

“We’re going to face some tough com-
petitors,” said Santos. “We’re expecting
to compete hard. Really, we just want to
leave the tournament as a better team and
as better players.” I‘
