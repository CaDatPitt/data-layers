Have You Lost Your Pajamas, Monsieur, Mq’mzelle?
If so, Apply to Lost-and-Found Station in State Hall

—..__.—

You may have wondered if (perhaps
argued about the question) men or
women were the more careless, that
is, which sex lost more (speaking of
possessions, not pounds). The answer
is to be found at the rear of State
Hall, where nestles the combined post
oﬁice, supplies department, and lost-
and—found station. In the interests of
masculinity and femininity, the fol-
lowing information has been un-
earthed. '

Women’s “forgetteries” appear to
be the best on the market. Nearly
2.000 of the 3,000 articles handled by
the department in the last ten years
have belonged to women; of the
articles claimed, the larger percentage
was regained by men.

Doo-dads and Whatnots.

The collection of articles is com-
prised of do—funnies varying from
bracelets to baby buggies and from
hats to shoes. From their very na-
ture it is unlikely that some will ever
be claimed. To wit, whoever left a
pair of women’s pajamas on the cen-
ter stairway in Alumni Hall is not
apt to rush in to the station, crying
for them, likewise the gentleman who
left merely the top to his sleeping gar-
ment in State Hall. '

Books, notebooks, bracelets, and
keys make up the greater part of the
collection. As a rule, books are
claimed, but the keys and bracelets
go to the boneyard. Since the begin-
ning of this semester, ﬁve books have
been turned in to the attendant and

three have been restored to the own-
ers; there have been no claimants at
all for the dozen bracelets and the
ﬁfteen sets of keys which are now in
possession of the department.
Purses to Pens.

Purses, umbrellas, and pen and pen-
cil sets usually return to their right-
ful proprietors, but gloves and hats
seldom ﬁnd their way home. One
may note that although there are ﬁf-
teen pairs of women’s gloves there
are none belonging to men, and that
there are two men's hats but no wo-
men’s. A possible explanation is that
men do not wear gloves and so can-
not lose them, and that women do
not remove their hats and so cannot
lose them.

Watches and other pieces of jew-
elry are usually claimed quickly, but
at present there is a lady’s wrist
watch, a sorority pin, and a fraternity
pin lying in state amidst other
orphaned objects.

There is one person who will not
even be able to read this column and
proﬁt thereby, for his glasses are in
the custody of the department.

The department explodes a gener-
ally held pet theory, that the depres-
sion causes students to take better
care of their belongings. Mr. James
Harkins, -who has been in charge of
the department for nine years, reports
that there is an increase in the num-
ber of articles turned in for the ﬁrst
quarter semester of 1932 over a simi-
lar period in 1929.

Battrick to Fete Cabinet at
Dinner Friday

The last of a series of Altitude
Teas given by the YWCA and YWHA
for freshmen will take place at the
Heinz House at 12:30 o’clock tomor-
row. Bear skin rugs and antlers will
give Heinz House the appearance of

The program includes a talk by
Dean Amos on “Appreciation of
Value,” a piano solo by Esther Bo-
reale, Ed. ’ 3, and an original poetry
reading by Gladys Schmitt, ’32.

Miss Edith Lazarus, head of the
YWHA, is to be hostess at the affair,
while Doris Custer, cha.irma.n of the
freshman Y club, will preside. Sand-
wiches and coffee will be served.

Miss Battrick will entertain the

Friday at 5:30 o’clock at Heinz House.
The meeting will be in the nature of
a retreat and the purpose of the af-

the week-end retreat to members who
were unable to attend.

Posture-Silhouette
Photos Taken By
Health Service

The Student Health Service, whose
policy has been to make a thorough
physical examination of each new
freshman, has inaugurated this year a
further improvement in its already
efficient system of student physical
examination by addition of a “posture
examination.”

Two posture-silhouette pictures are
taken of each freshman, a side view
and front view of the student’s habit-
ual posture. These are contrasted
with silhouettes of the student in an
approved posture, affording the ex-
aminee an excellent opportunity of
seeing for himself just what is wrong
with the way he stands so that he
will be able to correct it. Each fresh-
man will be called in to the ofﬁce and
consulted personally about his indi-
vidual posture, advice being given

him as to how to correct it. The stu- .

(lent of engineering will be able to
see how little support each of his
vertebraes is giving the others, and
will be able to “rebuild” or recon-
struct himself. On the other hand.
the student of psychology. til‘?-(I Of
holding himself in a ram-rod position
will be able to see that he can achieve
the same results with much less.» ef-
fort by assuming the correct posture
which is not one of stiffness but is
rather one of graceful ﬁrmness.

Political Symposium Nov. 4
at Schenley High

The University of Pittsburgh prom-
ises a big political show for all local
residents and students from October
31 to November 4. Being the week

before election time, it will be
crammed with meetings, rallies, and
all sorts of political ba.l1yhoo.; but the
campaign conducted by this school IS
unique in that it will be totally non-
partisan.

The Inquiry Club will conduct two
political meetings that week and will
have, as speakers, representatives of
the major political parties.

The week's program will culminate
with a formal symposium at the
Schenley High school auditorium on
Friday evening, November 4. Four
schools, including Pitt, will each send
two speakers. It was originally
planned to have each section of the
country represented, but negotiations
were not completed with any West-
ern school, so that Smith College, a
girls’ school, will probably substitute.
Princeton and Virginia are the other
colleges that will participate.

Held underthe sponsorship of the
Allegheny County League o-f Women
Voters, in conjunction with the Men’s
Debating Association, the symposium
will consist of talks by collegiate
members of major political pairties of
‘the nation. “Followers of parties not
represented by ofﬁcial collegiate
speakers,” Bracken said. “will be
given opportunity to present their
views after the regular talks and be-
fore public discussion.”

Princeton will furnish two speak-
ers, a Republican and a Socialist; Vir-
ginia will send one Hoover man and
one supporter of Roosevelt while Pitt
will deﬁnitely be represented by at
least one spokesman hacking the New
York governor. ‘

According to the present pla.u, the
program will be in the form of a 15-
minute talk by each of the speakers.
One member of each party will attack
opponents of his party, while his col-
league will defend the party.

At the -conclusion of the talks mem-
bers of the audience will be permitted
to question any of the speakers on
the policies and program of his party.
“Under this plan. the symposiuui will
be as non-pa1'tis;-.in as can be ar-
ranged,’’ Bracken asserted.

Mrs. R. Templeton Smith, president
of the Allegheny County League of
VVoIuen Voters. will act as chairman of
the symposium.

So far as the women are concerned,

only will there. be two speakers from
their ranks, but the League of Women
{Voters will oﬁicially open their mem-
; bership campaign.

Damp cots, no mail, canned food,
mosquitoes, snakes, animals, and their
combined complications are not con-
ducive to a.n altogether pleasant life
in tropical South America, in the
opinion of C. H. Desbach, Eng. ’27.

Until recently in the employ of the
Sinclair Exploration Company, Mr.
Desbach, visiting the University cam-
pus last week, spoke at a seminar

- session of juniors and seniors in the

department of oil and gas, Friday, of
his experiences in tropical South
IAmerica. Although a part of his three
years’ contract was spent on the ﬂood
plains, most of his time was passed in
the jungled foothills.

“There,” according to Mr. Desbach,
"hot days and torrential nights have
combined to produce an extremely
lush growth; giant magnolias and
mahoganies undergrown with dank
weeds and interlaced with lianas and
thorns; then the whole draped with
mosses. It is so thick that a man
cannot crawl through it on his hands
and knees, but must hire natives to
cut whatever paths a11d clearings he
needs with mac-hetes—a sort of en-
larged butcherknife, honed to a razor
sl1a.rpness.”

Travel by this Ibethod is far too
slow and expensive for geologic
reconnaisance. Travel, in the main,
is by stream. Sometimes this is in
native canoes, but more often because
of excessive gradients, wading breast-
deep is the only way satisfactory
progress can be made.

Snakes, Mosquitoes, Jaguars, Lack of Conveniences

Maize‘-“Life Difficult in South America, Desbach Says

 

Press, motion picture, book and
magazine notices of the ferocity of the
animals l1a.ve been overdone, Mr.
Deshbach claims. “Perhaps the most
frequent camp robber is the jaguar
which may attain to three hundred
pounds. As a method of capture, na-
tives tree it with dog packs and pro-
voke it into springing at them and
impaling itself on natives’ spears held
aloft.

“Of snakes, none is so virulent that
lancing and permanganate do not give
a victim even chances for recovery.

Frequent doses of quinine are pre-
cautionary measures against fever
carried by mosquitoes a.nd ample mos-
quito nets are a necessity. Vvaters
are chlorinated. and scrupulous care is
taken i.n the matter of canned goods
and native fruits to prevent dysentery
and ptomaine poisoning.

“As to letters,” said Mr. Desbach,
“No adequate solution has been found
for this sometimes depressing prob-
lem.”

In spite of all the inconveniences,
Mr. Desbach lauded the experience as
one helpful in attaining self discipline

and self reliance besides the addi-
tional salary offered as an induce-
ment. In this latter the speaker

claimed that Americans were more
fortunate than English, citing as a
reason the preponderance of techni-

cally trained men out of employment‘

in the British Isles at present.

tras, well-known on the campus. are
being considered for the rest of the
dances.

The assessment for the ﬁrst event
is thirty-ﬁve cents per person. It is
highly probable that the admission
price will be reduced for the remain-

A motion approved by council will
place the responsibility of ticket pur-
chase in the han(ls of Student Rela-
tions committee for the Sophomore
l-lop, Junior Prom, Yuletide Festival,
and Spring Sports dance.

These dances. it was pointed out,
provide the money for the continu-
ance of Senior VVeek. In order that
all tickets would be accounted for, and
a better check be made on proﬁts
arising from these dances. Student Re-
latious Committee will purchase the
number of tickets it ﬁnds necessary,
up to the 350 couples limit set for the
hotel, and turn them over to the
chairman to be sold.

Sigma Delta Chi, which sponsored
the homecoming dance in co11J'unction
with the homecoming celebration,
which that afternoon had been re-
fused permission to sell tickets at the
door and during the dance. was given
tperrnissiou to sell tickets by Council.

Because of Council's failure to ad-
vise the fraternity that Council had
exempted Sigma Delta Chi from the
Stnrlent Union building fund, and so
would not aid in ticket sale as it had
been promised to do with all dances
entering into the building drive, and
because of the dance’s peculiar status
as an invitation dance to students of
Ohio State as well as Pittsburgh, it
was decided after a motion by Frank-
iin A. Kallfelz, chairman of Student
Relations committee had been de-
feated, to allow this exception.

Preceding the election of vice presi-
dent and chairman of Student Tradi-
tions committee, Arthur Goldberg,
Col. ’33, newly elected to Council,
asked that a motion be made to abol-
ish this together with other com-
mittees which he believed are nonenti-
ties, and as such, should become one
temporary committee as the occasion
arises. This was carried over until
the next mee.ting of council.

Goldberg was el-ected by Council as
chairman of the Traditions committee,
and asked to continue as such until
final action had been taken in the mat-
ter of abolition of this committee.
Ray McCune, Eng. ’34, was elected
vice president. at the same time.

Because of the lateness of the hour
no discussion on the Student Union
building plan was held. This matter
was carried over until the next meet-
mg.

to be going so hot. a.s the hoi-p-olloil
say. and the head cheerleader seemed 
almost frantic. i

Incidentally, a rehearsal of the
official cheers wouldn’t hurt any- .
one. The cheerleaders them-
selves could take lessons from
the Ohio State boys who seemed
to come of a race of acrobats.

‘After an absence of two years from
the cheering section, it seems that the
world is all right when the familiar
cry. “ﬁght” goes out. yet, no
ﬁght has been seen.

The Pitt cheering section was
lifeless until the Panthers had the
ball on State’s one yard line.
Then, practically every “student"
yelled what play to use.

One student followed the cl1eer-
leaders to the letter. '\Vhen they
called for “hold them, Pitt.” he

grabbed a pretty blonde on his left
and held. Hurrah for a coeducational
institution.

With Sam F. yelling “step on
his frame,” and the ashes from
the cigarettes being smoked by
two coeds being blown in our
face. a good time was had by all.

I still can't understand how Jock
Sutherland can sit on the bench
throughout the game and smoke in-
numerable cigarettes without moving.
Even with the aid of ﬁeld glasses. you
can’t detect movement of any kind.

Predict An oth e r Successful

Season For Marksman

 

 

Although intercollegiate riﬂe (‘om-
petition does not get under way until
.Tanuar_v, Lieutenant Colonel Edward
J. Cullen is already predicting an-
other successful season for the Pitt
riilers.

Colonel Cullen 119$: reason to claim
a good riﬂe team. for when he looks
over the list of returning i-'ete1'ans he
finds Mair, Taussig. and Zoller, among
others, returning. The three men-
tioned were members of lasl: year's
team which lost only two telegmpliic .
matches. and numbered among its vic-
tories, one over the University of
Cincinnati team. winner of the Inter-
collegiate shoulder to shoulder riﬂe
title.

Equally enviable was Pitt’s sliowing
in the intercollegiate ROTC postal
competition, the team having com-
piled a record of seventeen matches
won against three defeats. In spite
of this. Pitt was shunted down to
fourteenth place in the intercollegiate
standing.

E. E. Mair, captain of this year's
squad, leads the impressive list of
candida.’res. A tentative roster of the
team lists: Manager (‘a.rlin. Taussig,
Zoller, Curris, Clise. Pannel. Hvkes,
Gradison, Davis, Quoshnock, Fried,
Baryh. Agner, and Beistel.

As there are more than two hun-
dred new cadets from which to choose
additional material. -it is quite possi-
ble that a number of men will be dis-
placed from their positions.

NRA postal matches already sched-
uled include: Stevens Institute. Uni-
versity of Florida. St. John’s College,
University of Washington, Cornell.
Penn. Renssalae-r, Brooklyn Polytech-

West Virginia Loses to
Panther Harriers, 23-32

“The mind was willing but the ﬂesh
was weak” might well describe the
feelings of West Virginia’s cross
country team as the Panther harriers
raced them to a 23-32 victory.

As usual, VVagenhouser led both
teams across the ﬁnish line, running
the difficult Schenley course in the
quick time of 27 minutes, 57 seconds.
VVest Virginia placed second and
third, but Pitt harriers garnered suf-
ficient places to win. VVest Virginia
was favored to win over the Panthers
by reason of their former showings
this season.

All of these organizations, without question, are’woi-thy of the

neither be measured nor repaid by the amount of actual cash re-

Just as the soliciting groups must budget their expenditures in
carrying out their programs throughout the year, so should every
student budget his or her expenditures when aiding“tl1ese same or-

Coleman, County Chairman,
Praises Hoover

The Inquiry Forum will present the
second of three political speeches to-
morrow at 12:30 o’clock when David
L. Lawrence, Allegheny County chair-
man of the Democratic party, will dis-
cuss "The Democratic Platform.” W.
H. Coleman, Republican County chair-
man, spoke last Vvednesday on "The
‘ Case for Hoover.”

Dr. Henry Van Essen, Socialist can-
ldidate for the United States Senate,
'will conclude the series a week from
tomorrow, pointing out the Socialist
; “President Hoover is the outstand-
ing national character of the day,”
was the keynote of former Congress-
man W. H. Coleman’s address before
the Inquiry Forum’, last Vvednesday
afternoon. Mr. Coleman. county chair-
man of the Republican party, spoke
on “The Case for Hoover.”

In defending Hoover’s record, the
speaker pointed to the Reconstruc-
tion Finance Corporation as a potent
means toward recovery, and the Pres-
ident’s plan of a one-third reduction
in world armaments as a great econ-
omy measure. The Hawley-Smoot
tariff he characterized as beneficial
to the American worker.

“The difference between the major
parties,” stated Coleman, “lies in their
views toward the tariff. The Demo-
crats,” he said, “have successively ad-
vocated free trade, a tariff for rev-

“Thinking people realize that Mr.
Hoover is not responsible for present
conditions,” he continued. “This de-
pression is the direct result of the
World War, just as the panic of 1873
was our penalty for the Civil War.
Mr. Hoover is the only person who
has proposed and put into effect re-

ally constructive measures during this '

depression.”

Ends Tryouts

Parrish Names Successful
Candidates Tomorrow

Men’s Debating Association will take
place this afternoon from 12:30 to
2:30 in room 217 Alumni Hall.

be announced tomorrow, Coach W. M.
Parrish said.

“The material this season is more
promising than any we have had for
many years,” Dr.. Parrish stated in
reviewing the efforts of candidates in
the tryouts last week. “This is due,”
he added, “to the fact that a great
many of the freshmen trying out this
year have had considerable previous
experience.”

John P. Bracken, manager, is pre-
paring aii extensive schedule for the
association this year. Several debates
will take place before audiences of
the Allegheny County League of Wo-
men Voters, since the league is now
conducting a study on the electric
utilities question, which is the sub-
ject being considered by the debaters.

Discussions will also be held by
teams of the debating squad at meet-
ings of several prominent Pittsburgh
organizations such as the Henry
George Club, the Electric League, and
the Advertising Club.

Quarrie Given
Leadin Play

Foreign-Speaking Students
Take Part in Tryouts

 

All Pitt students who can speak
foreign languages, either native or
learned in modern language classes,
are invited to try out for parts in
“Enter Madame,” Pitt Player’s ﬁrst
major production of the year.

Director Carl B. Cass, who has an-
nounced the selection of Betty Quar-
rie, Col. ’34, for the title role, and
Helen Bair. Col. ’33, as assistant di-
rector, says: “Although the lead for
the play has been selected, there are
still twelve unﬁlled roles which re-
quire actors who can speak foreign
languages ﬂuently.”

In addition to the production on
November 17 of “Enter Madame,” by

it‘-ilda Varesi and Dolly Byrne, which

concerns the adventures of an eccen-
tric coloratura soprano who tries to
recapture. her long-suppressed domes-
ticity, Mr. Cass is planning a series
of one-act plays to be presented dur-
ing December. These plays will be
in charge of members of Mr. Cass’
play production class, although it will
be possible for a few outside students
interested in dramatic coaching to
produce plays in connection with
the formal program.

"Students who have not appeared
previously in any campus production
are urged particula.rly to attend gen-
eral tryouts for st.udent—directed
plays,” advises Mr. Cass, “because
both their work in these plays as well
as their willingness to cooperate will
directly affect their chances to be
cast in future major productions."

ed for November 11, Armistice
Day, will be held in all schools
of the University, it was an-
nounced by the office of the
