CGS Dean to step down

By Rob Pugliese

Senior Staff Writer

John Bolvin, dean of the

University of Pittsburgh’s_

College of General Studies,
announced he will step down
in July of 1993.

The announcement signals
the end of Bolvin’s 10-year stint
as dean of CGS. He will resume‘
his teaching career at Pitt’s
Schoolof Education. Bolvin
began teaching at Pitt part—time
in 1957 and entered full—time
service at the university in
1964. Bolvin has held numer-
oustitles, including associate
director of the Learning
Research and Development
Center, and most recently,
associate dean at the School of
Education. Bolvin held this post
for the 10 years prior to taking
over as dean of CGS.

Committee

Bolvin gave no specific rea-
son for the decision other than
it was the best time for him to
stepdown in terms of what he
wants to accomplish.

“The move is all positive,”
Bolvin said. “Nobody’s telling
me to get out. I just think it’s
time.

Bolvin will retain his position
as Pitt’s NCAA faculty represen-
tative for the time being,
grooming people to take over
this position. That process will
likely take three or four years,
according to Bolvin.

As the NCAA faculty repre-
sentative, Bolvin, along with
independent investigator Mike
Glazier, conducted a 15-month
inquiry into_ allegations of
wrongdoing in the Pitt football
program. Bolvin reflected on
the changing of responsibilities

classrooms on campus

By Christine Hanna
News Editor ‘

Students who eat and drink
in Pitt classrooms are giving the
Provost Advisory Committee on
Classroom Facilities a reason to
begin renovating and cleaning
up.

William Flurry, chair of
PACCF, said that the committee
members were walking through
to look at the classrooms, and
he saw that students were car-
rying food and drinks into the
classrooms. He said that these
were classrooms that had
prominently—displayed signs

Santorum, King slam Democrats C

By Matt Groff
Staﬂ’ Writer

Students are hurt the most by
the current economic problems,
and they should demand
accountability from the
Congress, Congressman Rick
Santorum warned at Pitt’s
College Republicans’ meeting
Monday evening.

“The Constitution clearly states
that it is Congress who controls
the domestic agenda, it is not
the president’s function. What
voters need to do is to take a
look at all of the scandals in the
Democratic—controlled Congress
and insist that they clean house,”
Santorum said.

“Students are actually in the
worst shape. You lose jobs and
other opportunities because the
deficit is choking the economy.
You get very little out of what is
spent, but for years to come you
will have to pay the bill,” he
said. .

Santorum, who was one of

specifying no food or drink.
The committee has so far

renovated five classrooms- on »

the second floor in David
Lawrence Hall, the auditorium
in Frick Fine Arts building and
the Graduate School of Public
Health’s auditorium.

Flurry said he understood
that students do not get a
chance to eat and grab some-
thing in between classes, but
the “classrooms will stay better
and longer,” if the signs are
obeyed.

During the next three to four
years, the committee will" be

two speakers at the meeting, is
running for re-election to
Congress this November. Due to
the reorganizing‘ of
Congressional districts, he is run-
ning in the 18th district.

Over 50 members and sup-
porters of the College
Republicans turned out to hear
Santorum and a new contender
in the political arena, 14th dis-
trict congressional candidate
Byron King, Monday night.

“I am running against a ‘big,
government tax-and-spend
incumbent who we need to get
out of office,” King said. “Voters
need to start demanding
accountability from their repre-
sentatives, instead of accepting
rhetoric.

“Student involvement can
make a big difference in any
campaign. Passing out literature
and working phone lines are
some of the ways in which you
can contribute,” King said.
“Students have two extremely
important resources: energy and

enterprise. It is important that
you take an interest in politics
and demand answers, because it
does affect you.”

Also discussed at the meeting
were upcoming ‘events support-
ed by the CR5. A GOP rally at
Station Square and an Arlen
Specter rally are scheduled in
the upcoming weeks to build
momentum going
November.

Kevin Docheity, president of
CRs, is intent on swinging the
public opinion back to the
Republican side.

“We are working hard to orga-
nize support for these rallies to
offset all of the undeserved hype
Bill Clinton has received from
the media,” Docherty said. “I
read in The Pitt News about the
University Democrats, but our
meeting tonight shows the great
support College Republicans
have on campus. UDs said they
were preparing for their grande
ﬁnale, but I think they should be
preparing for a grand ﬁmeral.”

UPMC sponsors study

By Rebecca Baker
Staff Writer

Pitt students who suffer
from asthma can take part in
testing the experimental
anti—asthma drug MK591 at
the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center.

UPMC needs sixpeople
by Oct. 3 to complete the
study. Individuals must be
non-smokers between the
ages of 18 and 65. During
the experiment, participants
will be given either MK591
or a false pill. Participants
who finish the entire study
will receive $375.

“The drug has proven to
be remarkably well-tested,’.’
Associate Professor of
Medicine at UPMC, Dr.
William J. Calhoun, said.

“Besides a skin rash that
has showed up in a few
people, there have been no

substantial side effects,
unlike the standard corti-
sone treatments that have
caused weight-gain or bone-
softening,” Calhoun said.
According to extensive
studies on animals, human
blood and healthy non—asth-
ma volunteers, MK591 coin-
pletely inhibits leukotrine —-
a chemical an asthma
patient_creates that cause
bronchial muscles to con-
tract in an asthma attack.
Thirty medical centers
across the country spon-
sored by Merck Research
Laboratories in Rahway, N.J.,
are currently testing MK591
on asthma patients Pitt
Medical Center was chosen
“due to its fairly long history
of research, a stable popula-
tion and their resources and
facilities,” Calhoun said.
About 2.2 million asthma
sufferers live in Pittsburgh.

i for a faculty representative.

“It has become more time-
consuming, not just because of
the investigation,” Bolvin said.
“Rules have changed in athlet-
ics to put more emphasis into

the universities.”

The investigation covered
activities from Mike Gottfried’s
tenure as Pitt head coach to a

’ small portion of Paul Hackett’s

regime and concluded last

' January.

Bolvin will teach statistics,
research methodology and

- _evaluation at the School of

Education and cited his love of
teaching as a key factor in

making this move. Bolvin
expects that relinquishing his
duties as dean of CGS will
allow him more time to pursue
other interests, such as writing
and research projects.

Bolvin chose to announce his
decision now, allowing Pitt
ample time to conduct a search
for the new dean.

“If you don’t get started in
time, then the search will go
into next -school year, and
they’ll have to start over with a
new search,” he said.

Bolvin has agreed to stay on
as dean until Pitt finds the
replacement, but selected July
1 as his target date.

renovating approximately 50
classrooms on campus.
Renovations included painting,
upgrading the lighting, improv-
ing the audio-visual systems
and getting new seating.

_ Flurry said he feels that with
nicer rooms both the teachers

and students would want to be
there.

“If we can do things to make
things better than that is what
we should do," Flurry said. “We
all think it’s a worthwhile pro-
ject. Students will know the
administration is tiying to make
things better.”

Perot ponders

‘ Hear ye, Hear ye, come one, come all and join
around thy picture box to rejoice at the second coming
of the messiah. Welcome back H. Ross Perot. The
beloved Texas billionaire is about to re-emerge on the
political scene.

It could not have been any sooner. In this day and
age when politicians are consistently being criticized
for the failure to represent their constituents, their
inability to get things accomplished and the empty
rhetoric they spew from the side of their mouths, it is
nice to see someone like Perot who really cares about
the direction in which this country is heading. He is a
man who, upon seeing the void he has left in his fol-
lowers’ hearts, is willing to put all of his personal aspi-

rations aside and face an up-hill battle towards restor- .

ing the greatness that America once enjoyed.

If that’s true then we’re the greatest college newspa-
per in the country. Let’s be real. Perot has jerked the
public around for one reason and onelreason alone —
he loves the attention. Well, since Perot loves the
attention so much, we have a recommendation for him
— or more likely a prognostication. Do not re—enter
the race. Start a talk show starring the person you like
best — H. Ross Perot.

But let’s be serious. Ross Perot’s attempt is simply
futile, and he has made a mockery out of our political
system. Despite his finances, he hardly has the ability
to revitalize a campaign, with only five weeks left in
the election. He certainly cannot win. And his ability to
affect the outcome of the election, by now, has been
minimized. Those who left the Perot camp for the
Bush or Clinton camp are most likely not coming back
now. ,

 But let’s not trivialize Perot too much. He has had

. numerous accomplishments_. He has given much time

and money to civic causes and has been a powerful
outside voice in the handling of the POW/MIA situa-

_‘tion. Perot is a strong individual who has -worked hard

to get where he is today. It seems that he is more
capable of helping America by working outside of the
political arena than he is inside.

If Perot really wants to getback in the race because
of a calling from his constituents, then he should re-
enter. All voters should have the right to vote for the
candidate of their choice. Chances are, though, this is
not the case.‘ The man is most likely just bored. He’s
made all his money, and what else is there for him to
do other than sit there and watch it collect interest? Or,
now here’s an idea — run for president.

However, if Perot really wants to run in some sort of

election he should .watchfo'r Frank Perdue look-alike

contests around the country. Now there’s a contest he’s
sure to win. ‘

Criticism of The Pitt News unjust

,I was deeply disturbed to
read the article on Sept. 21,
1992, entitled, “SGB member
calls for resignations at The Pitt
News.” True, the decision" to
print the name of a sexual
assault victim was a poor one. I
believe that it is safe to assume
that no one on campus contests
that. However, I must applaud
The Pitt News for a well-written
article concerning the accusa-
tion of the Pittsburgh police’s
use of excessive force. The arti-
cle was written as all good arti-
cles should be; totally unbi-
ased. The reader was left to
form an opinion, as have many
students on campus.

I believe that Mr. Brody’s
claimslare off base and insult-
ing at best. Mr. Brody automati-
cally assumes that the majority
of students reading the article
will merely skim over it and
miss the fact that it was the City
of Pittsburgh police and not the
university police involved in
the incident.

If a reader finds an article
interesting, he or she will take

the time to read it. It only takes

a few seconds to read the first
few lines wherein the majority
of the important information is
found. At any rate, -if a student
is genuinely interested in the
world around him or her, he or
she will take the time to read.
The Pitt News cannot possibly
be held responsible for how
much or how responsibly one
reads.

Secondly, perhaps Mr. Brody

has forgotten that there is cur-

rently a newspaper strike with-
in the city of Pittsburgh. For
some of us, The Pitt News is
one of the only sources of local
information available, and I
believe that The Pitt News has
been doing, an excellent job of
reporting local news and con-
cerns of the university.

Lastly, in regards to Mr.
Brody’s statement, “  the City
of Pittsburgh police was very

disturbed and feels insulted '

and cheated  ,” the police

should _ feel this way.
Considering the conduct of so-
called professional police offi-
cers, I too would be ashamed
of my cnduct. The police
were out of line, and excessive
force is never justified, unless
of course the City of Pittsburgh
has considered changing its
name to Los Angeles. Keep up
the good work, Pitt News. The
truth is always controversial.

Animals suffer the most

Obviously, ethics played no
part in the recent transplant of
a baboon’s liver into a man at
the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center.

Experimenters there play
with 8 million tax dollars a year
but tell us only what sounds

-good. In their shower of pub-

licity from coast to coast when
they performed the transplant,
they neglected to mention the
critical fact that their patient
was HIV positive.

A weakened immune system
would have trouble rejecting
the liver, making the operation
appear successful.

Such self-serving vivisectors ‘

misuse our health funds this
way in laboratories throughout
the country, neglecting desper-
ately-needed but non-lucrative
clinical investigations of ways
to prevent or reverse organ dis-
ease. _

Life expectancy in the United
States is an abysmal 16th in the
world, and our infant mortality
rate is a sad 22nd. Millions of
people don’t have insurance
and can’t afford even rudimen-
tary health care.

The biggest immorality con-
cerns the animals, who are not
responsible for our ills.

Ba_boons and other intelli-
gent, social primates are ware-
housed for years, often alone in
cages where they can barely
move and where they go
insane, rocking back and forth
continually.

Primatologist Dr.
Goodall wrote she will be
“haunted forever” by her visit
to a primate laboratory in 1987.

The baboon killed for his
-liver had been imprisoned his
whole 15-year life. The true
cost of the Pittsburgh fiasco
was the quality of life of a vul-

nerable, trusting young man

and his loved ones, the impris-
onment and murder of a
baboon and all the “practice”
‘animals before him and the
future well—being of thousands
of people and animals.

By Cory Walborn
Saga.” 

It’s over!

Head volleyball coach Sue
Woodstra’s winning streak —
24 games to zero — and the
Panthers’ “invincibility” within
the whole Big East conference,
is over.

A scrappy Villanova team
not only beat Pitt last Friday
but handed Woodstra her first
Big East loss ever.

In its first Big East competi-
tion of the season, the Pitt vol-
leyball team, so accustomed to
beating Big East opponents,
lost its edge and fell. _

“We need to become a lot
more mentally ‘ tough,”
Woodstra said. “If we don’t
want to go out and win a
match, we won’t.”

Woodstra said that no excus-
es can be found within the
Panthers fifth loss of the sea-
son.

“We have used that [youthful
team] excuse long enough,”
Woodstra said. “The ability to
go out and play requires no
experience.”

Looking at the statistics, Pitt
out hit, out dug and out
blocked the Wildcats. But sev-
eral service errors at crucial
times hurt the Panthers tremen-
dously, ,W_,oo_dstra__ said. , J _

“I’m very disappointed [about
the Villanova lossl,” Woodstra
said. “It’s-a team we should
beat.”

Woodstra said she did not
want to make any excuses for
the loss.

“Villanova fought hard,”
Woodstra said. “They would
have run through brick walls to
get the ball up.

“But we did not respond,”
Woodstra said. “We could
never get into any type of
groove.”

Losing 15-13, 11-15, 15-11
and 15-12, the only groove the
Panthers could find was a los-
ing one.

“I hope we use this game as
a wake-up -call,” Woodstra said
of her. Pitt team as it looks at a
schedule full of Big East teams.

But before the Big East . 

opponents arrive, Pitt had
another task at hand. After
Friday’s disappointment, the
Panthers faced the Virginia
Cavaliers on Saturday.

After losing the first two
games, Pitt came back to pull
out a five-game victory over
the Cavaliers. The Panthers got
a great performance from
junior Ann Marie Lucanie (27
kills) on their way to a 13-15,
9-15, 15-7, 15-3 and 15-11 vic-
tory. '

That win raised Pitt’s record
to 5-5 but still didn’t take the
sting out of the Villanova loss.

Woodstra said a lack of con-
tinuity has, been_a problem
with this team’s ability to prac-
tice. .

“We have so many people
coming to practice late and

leaving early [both because of
class conﬂictslﬁ’ Woodstra said.
“It is so hard to have a com-
plete practice with the whole
team.

“But we have a lot of pride

and we know what this pro-
gram has built,” Woodstra said.
“We have the talent, but we
need the mental aspects as
well, and that is what I told the
team.”

Women's tennis four game win
streak snapped in New Jersey

By Tom Schneider
Staff Writer

The women’s tennis team
had its four-game winning
streak snapped last Thursday in
New Jersey when it dropped its
first match of the year to
Trenton State College, 6-2.

Theteam stayed in Trenton
following the loss to. the Lady

Lions to compete against the

top playersin the East Coast
Athletic Conference in an indi-
vidual tournament.

After a 6-3 win at the Cost
Center against Canisius last
Sunday, the Lady Panthers had
their matches against
Youngstown State and IUP
postponed until later dates. The
unexpected three-day layoff
evidently had an adverse effect
on the team, as the Lady
Panthers won only two of the
eight matches played.

Trenton State started the
onslaught when its No. 1 sin-
gles player, Gina Dileggi, hand-
ed Pitt’s Julie LoPrinzi her first
loss in team competition this
year. LoPrinzi started off slow-
ly, losing the first set 6-2.
LoPrinzi then came alive to
take the second set from
Dileggi, 6-4. The two players
battled into a third set tiebreak-

er, where Dileggi prevailed to
win the set and the match (6-2,
4-6, 7-6C7-1)).

First—year Panther Alison
Baker followed with a loss in
No. 2 singles to Trenton’s Tricia
Mueller. Baker was competitive
in the first set despite losing
seven games to five. She
bowed out quickly in the sec-
ond set and lost the match (7-5,
6-2).’

Pitt’s Marla Zielinski per-
formed similarly in her No. 4
singles match against Jen
Lardiere. Lardiere had to work
in the first set, eventually win-
ning 7-5. She then stearnrolled
through the second set to win
the match in straight sets (7-5,
6-0).

In Nos. 5 and 6 singles, Pitt’s
Carie Voda and T ammy Keister
were quickly blown down.
Voda lost in straight sets to
Trenton State’s Samantha
Nichols (6-2, 6-1). Keister lost
to Dawn Passaro in straight sets
(6-2, 6-3).

Pitt’s only bright spot in sin-
gles was No. 3 player Erika
Devins, who defeated Jill Roth
in straight sets (6-1, 6-4).

Pitt and Trenton State split
their two doubles matches,
with the team of Baker and
Zielinski avenging their singles

losses by emerging victorious
in No. 2 doubles. They defeat-

ed the Lady Lion tandem of

Passaro/Nichols in three sets
(6-2, 4-6, 6-2).

Voda and Keister lost their
No. 3 doubles match in straight
sets (6-2, 6-2). '

Head ‘ coach George
Dieffanbach did.not criticize
the performance of his_team
following the match. -

“It was tough forus to play a
team as good as ‘Trenton on a
hardcourt surface [as opposed
to the artificial turf at the Cost
Center],” Dieffanbach, said.

Following the 6-2 defeat, the
Lady Panthers took part in the
ECAC at Trenton, where they
would try to hone their individ-
ual skills in a round-robin tour-
nament.

Pitt’s players apparently
could not compete with the
pool of talent in the ECAC, as
they won only two matches,
one of which was by default.

The competition in Flight A
singles, where each team sports
its top two players, was too
much for Pitt’s LoPrinzi and
Baker. 2

In four matches, Pitt’s finest
could manage to win only
three games total against the
best in the ECAC.

Mexican  
win the

Great Race

By Jason
Feuchtwanger

For The Pitt News

Both Alejandro Cruz
and Judi St. Hillaire took
home Great Race titles in
spectacular
Sunday morning leading
the 10 kilometer race vir-
tually from start to finish.

Alejandro Cruz, 24,
from Mexico City, won
the Great Race with a
time of 27:56. Judi St.
Hillaire took the women’s
title with a time of 31:50.

Cruz and Boay Aronay,
from Tanzania, ran side
by side well ahead of a
second pack of three
runners through the first
three miles of the race.
Cruz eventually pulled
away from Aronay
around the four mile
mark. Aronay finished
second with a time of
28:03.

Cruz, who finished 7th
at last year’s Great Race,
said that he knew _he
could out sprint Aronay
and that the hilly course
was to his advantage
because he prefers the
hills.

Judi St. Hillaire, 33,
from Fall River Mass-
achusetts, successfully
defended her Great Race

title and like Cruz was -

never seriously threat-
ened. St. Hillaire said that
she was happy with the
win but a little disap-

pointed with her time, I

which was 33 seconds
slower than last year’s

time. She attributed her

slower time to the weath-
er conditions. \ V
“The rain didn’t bother

me because the rain,

stopped shortly after the
race began, but the
humidity bothered me,”
Hillaire said. ’

Paivi Tikkanen, from
Finland, was second to
Hillaire with a time of
32:15.

The top Pittsburgh resi-
dents to finish were Paul
Zimmerman, a‘ Pitt gradu-
ate student, who finished
12th with a time of 30:15.
Laura Rudy was the top
female Pittsburgh resi-
dent.

Despite the inclement
weather, approximately
10,000 runners turned out
at Frick Park for the 16th
annual Great Race.

The 10K (6.2 miles) is
the 6th largest race of its
kind in the country.
