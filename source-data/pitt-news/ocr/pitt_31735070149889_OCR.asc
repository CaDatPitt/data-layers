Students

rally  
for state
funding

Byjoe Chilson
Staﬁ Writer

It began with a beat and a whisper,
and it grew from there, until the

thunderous sound of 200 voices

reverberated off the domed ceiling S
at the Pennsylvaniastate Capitol
building. ..

“Lean on me, if you’re not
strong. I-’ll be your friend. I’ll help
you carry on,” the students sang.

Students from Pitt, Penn State,
Temple and Lincoln joined to-
gether Tuesday in Harrisburg for
the Pennsylvania Association of
State—Related Students rally. They
made the trip to protest further
cuts to state allocations for higher
education before Gov. Tom Corbett
announces his 2012-2013 budget
proposal on Feb. 7.

At 7 a.rn., 45 Pitt students
boarded a bus outside the William
Pitt Union to make the three—hour
trek east. _

While students made a signiﬁ-
cant showing, only three members
of the legislature attended because
the rally was held on a day when
the state assembly was not in ses-
sion. Organizers of the rally said
this was because they wanted the
rally to happen before Corbett’s
budget announcement. .

But students at the rally orga-
nized by PASS —— which has cen-
tered on taking student concerns
to lawmakers in Harrisburg — did
not seem discouraged by the lack
of attention from lawmakers. The
rally culminated in the heartfelt
singing of ﬁght songs and Alma
Maters, along with a good bit of
dancing.

Robert Beecher, SGB’s Govern-
mental Relations Committee chair,
said that Pitt students’ goal was to
show legislators how important
state—related schools are to the
people of Pennsylvania.

“Pennsylvania schools can pro-

vide a unique and well-rounded

Cllegiate Readership Program to return in March

Board votes to wait until lock boxes can be installed before bringing newspapers back to campus.

By Michael Ringling
Staﬁ Writer

The Collegiate Readership Pro-
gram will returnlon March 13
when locked newsstands will ar-
. rive on Pitt’s campus filled with
copies of The New York Times
and USA Today. V
At Tuesday night’s Student
Government Board meeting in
Nordy’s Place, the Board voted
to approve the program that it
voted to halt a month ago. The
reinstatement of the program
came after a month of student
outcry following the. initial de-
cision by the Board to stop the
program over winter break. The
Collegiate Readership Program

will cost non—College of General -

Studies students $33,600 from

the Student Activities Fund.

But the vote did not come
without controversy.

Initially, the Allocations
Committee recommended that
the Board deny the request for
funding inpfull, because it did
not fit within “the purpose of
allocations.” But Board member

A Gordon Louderback proposed

an amendmentto fund" the full
$33,600 cost of the program.

“We have been talking about
this program for over a month,”
Board President James Lan-
dreneau said. “It is a daily pro-
gram for students.”

The motion to approve the
program passed with a 6-2 vote
— Board members Alex Murdoch
and Halim Genus voted against
the program’s reinstatement. _

The program’s $33,600 cost is B

a $3,100 increase over the price

of the program during its pilot
stage, because The New York
Times raised its price per paper
by 10 cents.

Board memberjulie Hallinan.
moved to amend the motion
to fund the Collegiate Reader-
ship Program’s return within a
week and a half for an additional
$6,000. The Board voted against
the motion with a 2-6 vote —
Hallinan and Board member
Zoe Samudzi voted in favor of
immediate reinstatement. _

Immediate reinstatement
would have brought the news-
papers back to unlocked news-
stands in about a week. The
program was halted because it
could not bar the public, faculty,
graduates and College of General
Studies students from takingthe
newspapers paid for by the Stu-
dent Activities Fee, which only

non—College of General Studies
undergraduate students pay.
The incoming locked boxes will
havestudent ID readers that will
ensure that non-students won’t
have access to the papers — but
graduate students and CGS stu-
dents might.

Earlier in the meeting, during
Allocations requests, the African
Student Organization withdrew
a request for $10,079.14 after a
lengthy and heated discussion
between representatives of the

organization and the Board.

The organization requested
the money to fund an event that
would include bringing in co-
median Don’t Jealous Me from
Africa.

The Allocations Committee
recommended that the Board
approve $2,689.70 to cover the

Allegheny County Executive Rich

Fitzgerald and Deputy District At— '

torney Mark Tranquilli talked elec-
tions —-— and dropped off a check
— at a meeting with the Pitt-Col-
lege Democrats Tuesday Night.
“The president knows that if
he doesn’t win Pennsylvania, he
won’t win the election,”"Fitzger-

ald said.

With the Republican primaries
heating up, Pittsburgh promises to
become an important front in the
battle for Pennsylvania, which, as

a swing state, will almost certainly V

help decide the national election.

As Republican candidate Mitt
Romney claimed victory in the
Florida primary election last
night, local politicians Fitzger-
ald and Tranquilli discussed the
economy, energy, Republicans and
the campaign season with about 20
Pitt Democrats in the William Pitt

Union at the club’s weekly meeting.
Before the political talk, Fitzgerald
donated $1,000 to the club.

It was the second such dona-

tion to the club by a local politician V

this election season. On Sept. 28,
U.S. Rep. Mike Doyle, D—Pa., also
donated $1,000 when he attended
a Tuesday night meeting.’

Lara Sullivan, president of the
Pitt College Democrats, anticipates
a busy election season — the club
is already in contact with Presi-
dent Barack Obama’s re-election
campaign. _ ‘

“We” have done a lot of cam-

paign work around Pittsburgh and r

in the state of Pennsylvania,” she
said. “We do work such as canvass-
ing and phone banking, especially
around the time of elections.”
Fitzgerald, who was inaugu-
rated in early January, spoke on
the importance of electing other
Democratic candidates to office at
the local and state levels. I
In his pep talk with the Col-
lege Dems, he said, that after the

2008 election thatpput Obama in
office, Republicans movedfar to
the right, causing them to take ex-
treme stances on economic and
social issues. .

. . g.,;.,,

“The president
knows that if[ 

i he doesn’t win’
Pennsylvania,
he won’t win
the election.”

—Rieh Fitzgerald

“With these Tea Party Repub-
licans, there’s no compromise,”
Fitzgerald said. “We ‘need to ensure
that, as Democrats, we put policies

2 in place that are balanced.” V _ T
P Casey Rankin, presidentof '

the Pitt College Republicans, said
that Fitzgerald’s accusations of
obstructionism in the House of

Representatives were “untrue.” f U
   said that the Republicans
~ in‘the House of lRepresentatives '
have proposed over 20 jobs bills 
that were either voted do'_,W_n’- in.

the Democrat-controlled Senate
or vetoed by Obama. _ _
“It’s a cop’-out by the presi-
dent‘ and Democrats, because
they haven’t gotten anything
done,” Rankin said. “They have
no achievements,'so they’re try-
ing to run against the ‘do-nothing
Congress.”’ _ ' ~ ,
Fitzgeraldsaid that the Obama
administration effectively over-
came Republican "opposition to
stabilize the economy. He said
that before Obama took office, Al-
legheny County lost around 7,000
jobs per month. He said that since ,
then, unemployment in the county
slowly_fell to 6.6 percent —— lower

lpulitiians speak to College Democrats

than the national.unemploym‘ent
rate of 8.5» percent. P '  _ . V

. Tranquilli also said that a strong
justice system in Allegheny County
is key, noting a need to combat a
culture of witness intimidation
that has swept the country —

and the county -— under the “no”

snitching” banner.
' ' “We have the right combina-

education that’s affordable, and
that’s because of their relationship
to the state government,” Beecher
said.

Matthew Parido, chief of staff
for state Sen. Lloyd Smucker, said
that funding for higher education
is high on his off1ce’s list of priori-
ties. Even so, he predicted spend-
ing slashes across the board in the
2012-2013 budget.

“There are going to be cuts at
every level of state government,”
Parido said.

PASS, an interscholastic orga-

' nization, was formed in Decem-

 

—

ber 2010 in response to Corbett’s
election and prospective education

budget cuts. PASS advocates for‘

the students from the four state-
related schools that are not in the
state system of higher education
but receive subsidies from the state
government. . '

' “We knew that, united, we were
stronger,” said Molly Stieber, a
former SGB president who helped
found PASS. “If you want to work
with these legislators, you need
them to take you seriously.”

Last February, PASS held its ﬁrst

rally to protest budget cuts. While
Corbett originally proposed fund-
ing cuts of more than 50 percent to
state-related universities, the state
budget that passed chopped Pitt’s
funding by 19 percent.

‘‘If you want
to work
) with these
legislators, you
— need them
i to take you
seriously.”
-Molly Stieber

To help ﬁll its $40 million bud-
get gap, ‘Pitt raised in—state tuition
by 8.5 percent and out-of~state tu-
ition by 4 percent.

Many of the speakers at Tues-
day’s_ rally recounted Corbett’s
2011-2012 budget proposal with
palpable scorn. .

“It was really hurtful,” Stieber
said in reference to the effect of
the budget cuts, “That’s the reason

‘ there was a lot more negativitythis

95

year.

SGB president James’ Lan-.
dreneau, Board memberjulie Hal-
linan and editor of Pitt Political
Review Tom Visco spoke on behalf
of Pitt students at the rally. Each
speaker highlighted the impor-
tance of funding higher education
by extolling the benefits of the Pitt

 llTNEW

experience.
“Pitt is an institution that push-
es students to strive for the truth

in the pillars above us,” Visco said, '
referencing the four pillars painted V

.on the ceiling of the Capitol Ro-
tunda that represent "art,- justice,
science and religion.

In the spring, PASS—will meet
again in Harrisburg to hold a

second rally. Pitt, along with the

other state-related schools, will
demonstrate at the Capitol, with
University student leaders hold-
ing one—on-one meetings with
legislators. .

But Tuesday was about sparking
discourse concerning the looming
state budget proposal. '

For Kita, the absence» of white-coated

Serendipity not science fiction

Some of the most important scientiﬁc discoveries were accidents

   

By Abdul Ahmed
Columnist

 
 

 

It tooka radioioperator to discover
something thatcould be used to
treat virtually all forms of cancer.
And on the way, he found a way to
“burn” salt water.

John Kanzius was an American
inventor, radio and TV engineer and
resident of ‘Erie, Pa. He ended his
career in 2003 as a radio station
owner when he discovered he had a
rare form of leukemia. Experiencing
the side effects of conventional che-
motherapy, Kanzius was compelled
to ﬁnd abetter treatment. In a mo-
ment that can only be described as
serendipitous, he discovered that
a certain radio frequency, when
applied to salt water, could cause
water to convert into hydrogen and
oxygen gas. The gas could then be
burned. The process might not have
been a way to treat cancer, but it had
potential in the future to enhance
many different energy—requiring
applications. '

Eventually, Kanzius returned to
his original goal. In a partnership
with Dr. David Geller, he discov-
ered that gold and carbon particles
could be used to reach only cancer
cells in the body. If radio frequen—_
cies were applied to the body at a
level attuned to the nanoparticles,

those cells only would heat up and
die. Unfortunately, the technology
came too late. Kanzius passed away
in 2009. However, his innovation
lives on. UPMC is spearheading the
development of this technology.
Based on promising results, trials
are scheduled to run this year.
You learn about the scientiﬁc
method from an early age. The art
that is science is made out to be
almost as regimented as the ﬁve-
paragraph essay. But hopefully,
once you enter college, you learn
that “introduction, body and con-
clusion” is sometimes not the best
way to write. You ﬁnd that some of
your best literary work might result

from simply letting ideas ﬂow as .

they come.

Similarly, the scientiﬁc method,
although a time-honored strategy,
is not what always leads to discov-
ery. Sometimes in science, things
just happen; sparks ﬂy, and reac-
tions occur. If we brieﬂy survey
our scientiﬁc history, we note that
some of our most astounding inven-
tions and discoveries occurred on

‘ the basis of chance — they were

mere accidents. This might bring
into question a perhaps misplaced
sense of self—conﬁdence science af-
fords use when we study the natural
world. '

There was a time that purple
dye — Tyrian dye — was worth

its weight in silver. It was a natu-
rally occurring dye that had to be
extracted from sea snails. The pur-
ple would only deepen with age, and
it attracted royals and aristocrats
alike, as early as the time of the
Phoenicians. Thousands of these
snails were pulverized and boiled to
extract just one gram of dye.

The dye industry has changed
since the days of antiquity. Sir
William Henry Perkin, an English
chemist, was working in 1856 to
synthesize quinine, a substance
in high demand for the treatment
of malaria. It was during one of
these experiments, using aniline
as a precursor molecule, that he
accidentally discovered the ﬁrst
synthetic dye, a deep purple he
named mauveine. At the age of 18,
he had found a cheap substitute to
the much—ﬂaunted Tyrian dye. His
discovery was not calculated, not
estimated and not predicted.

If there is one constant reminder
of your mortality, it is your ticker.

that each individual has a set num-

cine. However, before the 1950s,
the different models available were
not viable as implantable pacemak-
ers. Often, they were cumbersome
and had to be plugged into a wall
socket. . '

Wilson Greatbatch was an
American engineer and inventor.
He already had the notion that
heart activity could be modeled by
electronics. In 1958, while trying
to create a circuit to record heart
sounds, he accidentally used a re-
sistor 100 times as resistive as he
intended; they’re really small, after
all. The circuit cycled" a pulse for
1.8 milliseconds, was silent for the
next second, andrepeated itself —
a perfect human heartbeat. Com-

bined with his ongoing tinkering
with small batteries, the accident
constituted the ﬁrst implantable
pacemaker, which has saved mil-
lions of lives since its inception, as
reported by The New York Times in
Greatbatch’s commemoration.
The primary causes of deathin
the United States are heart disease
and cancer. This was not always the
case. History before antibiotics is

often mocked with the depiction '

of a fellow suffering a scratch and
subsequently dying. Yet this was
indeed the state of affairs. Bacterial
infections were deadly.

Sir Alexander Fleming was a
Scottish biologist and pharmacolo-
gist. In 1928, he was continuing his
work researching staphylococcus, a
bacterium. Fleming often kept his
laboratory untidy. After returning
from a holiday, he noticed one of
his staphylococci cultures had been

contaminated by afungus. The mold
was excreting a substance that was
killing the bacteria. He identiﬁed
the fungus as part of the Penicil-
lium genus, and he subsequently
labeled the antibiotic penicillin.
As you probably know, this antibi-
otic and its subsequent derivatives

‘ revolutionized medical practice.

We usually don’t die from scratches
anymore. 4'

Some of our most necessary dis-_ 

coveries have occurred by chance.
It was mere happenstance, ser-
endipity that produced a result.
However, is this part of science or
not‘? Perhaps it is;'l_Beyoind predict-

' . product of humaﬁfagency. What if

these accidents — and countless

others —— had not happened? It’s
an unsettling thought.

Still, there is one vestige of hope
in this extraordinary history. The
fact is, accidents just happen, but
one must know what to do with
them. As Louis Pasteur claimed,
“Chance favors only the prepared
mind.” In each of these cases, the
chemist, the inventor and the bi-
ologist knew what to do with the

"i’oppot'tunity chance granted them.
Human agency is still necessary,
and it always will be. As with muta-

tions, accidents are almost guaran- "

they propel us beyond what would

accidents will always happen in sci-

Panthers lose eighth straight game

Pitt guard Asia Logan injured her shoulder infirst half and didn’t return

By Jasper Wilson
Staff Writer

The Pitt women’s basketball team
roster depleted further on Tuesday
night when sophomore guard Asia
Logan injured her shoulder on a
loose ball pileup in the ﬁrst half.

Logan didn’t return to the game
as the Panthers (8-14, 0-9 Big East)
fellto St._]ohn’s (14—8, 6-3 Big East)
66-51 at the Petersen Events Cen-
ter.

Pitt — which has lost eight‘
straight games — has already been
without freshman guard Loliya
Briggs all season and also lost
freshman forward Cora McManus,
who is having shoulder surgery on
Thursday and will be out for eight
months. ’ '

Logan is currently averaging
6.2 points per game. The severity
of her injury and her timetable for
return weren’t known, but Pitt head
coach Agnus Berenato said it would
“be tough for [Logan] to make a
comeback.”

“It gives us a great opportunity
to face adversity,” Berenato said.
“You know what, if we’re going to
go ahead and learn, then we might
as well go learn and get it all done

. in one year. Let’s just make a pact:

We get it out of the way‘ this year,
and let’s learn from it.”

St.John’s head coach Kim Barnes
Arico said she empathized with the
Panthers.

“When you’re inexperienced,
this league is unforgiving on any
‘given night,” Arico said. 3

Pitt had 15 turnovers in the ﬁrst
half, but managed to keep it close
by shooting 50 percent from the
ﬁeld.

Guard Ashlee Anderson’s back-
to-back 3-pointers sparked a 10-4
run with 3:30 left in the ﬁrst half,
keeping the Pantherswithin strik-
ing distance.

' The Panthers ended the half on a
7-0 run to close the gap to one point,
28-27, but they couldn’t hold on to
the momentum after the break.

The Red_Storm opened the half
with a 6-0 run off two Pitt turn-
overs and never let Pitt back into
the game.

Four of the six points during the '

run came off fast-break chances.
Freshman point guard Brianna
Kieselsaid the Red Storm’s aggres-
sive defense resulted in fast-break
points. V

Pitt had one of its best shooting
halves all season to start the game,
shooting 50 percent from the ﬁeld.
In the second half, the Panthers shot
just 30 percent from the ﬁeld.

Anderson — Pitt’s leading scor-
er with 19 points — picked up her
third foul on the ﬁrst possession of

the second half.

She stayed in the game but failed
to score another point until there
was 6:48 to go in regulation.

Anderson tried to explain the
team’s struggles scoring the ball.

“It just hasn’t been there offen-
sively,” Anderson said. “We’re get-
ting better at taking shots and mak-

ing shots, but we have to take more

shots and make more shots.”

Turnovers proved costly for Pitt,
as St.John’s converted 26 points off
26 Panther turnovers.

“You can’t have 26 turnovers,”
Berenato said. “It’s just really tough
to overcome.”

Arico said she thought her

team’s failure to ﬁnish chances of

turnovers kept the game close.

St. John’s forward Da’Shena
Stevens led all scorers with 19
points.

The Red Storm dominated in-
side, winning the points—in—the—
paint battle 46-14.

Berenato said her team knew the
Red_Storm would attack the lane,
but the Panthers still weren’t able
to stop the inside attack.

“We knew that they were very,
very powerful in the paint,” Ber-
enato said. “We knew they did that
—— we knew that they scored in the
paint. We played a lot of 2-3 zone,
but they were still able to get into
the gaps and score.”

exist during Super Bowl

By Greg Trietley
Senior Staff Writer

Nearly 163 million people watched
at least some of last year’s Super
Bowl between the Pittsburgh Steel-
ers and the Green Bay Packers, ac-
cording to Nielsen. Of all the tele-
visions that were on that night,
71 percent of them were tuned to
V the game.

So what about the other 29
percent?

Indignant vows made by fans
of losing teams surely account for
some of that total. “I’m not going
to watch this Super Bowl if it’s the

Patriots and Giants,” a 49ers fan,
some Steelers fans and a Broncos

backer probably said this year. -2

Whether it’s an empty pledge or a
true promise will be revealed this
Sunday.

There are more people that
watch something other than the
Super Bowl (29 percent) in Amer-
ica than there are Catholics (23.9
percent), African Americans (12.2
percent) or children under the age
of 15 (20.2 percent).

A portion of that 29 percent

Chryst completes
coaching staff

By Lauren Rirschman
Sports Editor

Pitt head football coach Paul Chryst
completed his coaching staff on
Tuesday when he announced Inoke
Breckterﬁeld as the new defensive
line coach of the Panthers.

Breckterﬁeld coached the offen-
sive line at UCLA last season. '

“Our defensive linemen are go-
ing to really beneﬁt from Inoke’s
experience as a player and coach,”
Chryst said in a Pitt press release.
“Inoke was an outstanding player at
Oregon State who went on to play in
the CFL. Personally and profession-
ally, he is an outstanding addition
to our sta .”

UCLA ﬁnished 112th in the na-
tion in sacks per game in 2011,
managing just one sack a game. The
Bruins also ranked 87th in tackles
for loss, with ﬁve tackles for loss
per contest.

But before coaching the defen-
sive line at UCLA, Breckterﬁeld
coached a successful defensive
line at Montana in 2010. The Griz-
zlies ﬁnished ﬁrst in the Big Sky
Conference and 14th in the nation
with 7.64 tackles for loss per game.
Montana also ranked second in the

conference and 18th in the nation .

in sacks per game, with 2.64.

' The year before Breckterﬁeld’s 3‘

arrival, Montana ranked g103rd in
tackles for loss and 88th in sacks
per game nationally.

Before becoming a coach, Breck-
terﬁeld played defensive end at Or-
egon State. He’s the ‘career leader
for the Beavers in tackles for loss
(55.5) and sacks (19.5). After his
career ended at Oregon State, he
played in the Canadian Football
League for ﬁve seasons.

He became a volunteer assistant

for Oregon State in2006 and served K

as a graduate assistant in 2007 and
2008. He‘ took his ﬁrst full-time
coaching job in 2009 as the defen-
sive line coach at Weber State.
Breckterﬁeld graduated from

who mistakenly bought airtime on“

Oregon State with a bachelor’s de— re ‘

gree in liberal studies.

Chryst’s complete coaching staff
is as follows:

Bob Bostad: offensive coordina-
tor/offensive line

Inoke Breckterﬁeld: defensive (

line
Bobby Engram: wide receivers
Eddie Faulkner: running backs
Matt House: secondary
Dave Huxtable: defensive coor-
dinator

“AFV” includes “a dog swiping a cupcake at a

a vulnerable vantage point and a montage
of ﬁshing mishaps.” A must—see!

Fox has its animation lineup, highlighted
by an hour of “The Cleveland Show.” The

backstroke, just shy of the NCAA B cut in the
event. He’s swum below that cut before, but

9

4"

Knoles expects him to break his best time at
Big East championships. ‘

“I tried my best,” the Pitt junior said. “I’m
happy that I won, but I’rn not really satisﬁed
with my time.“

Knoles oﬁered a more spirited review ofhis
performance.

“Adam Maczewski was lights—out today,” '

Knoles said. “He’s getting tougher and tougher.
He’s expressed his dislike for the 200 back-
stroke, and we’ve expressed our side of things
that he needs to embrace that event —— it’s his.
I don’t think Adam has lost the 100 baclstroke
in two years in a dual meet.

“I would hope that he could get in the 46
range, fast enough to getthat NCAA cut,” Knoles
said. “He’s competed against some of the best

backstrokers in the country, so I expect him to »

go to NCAA Champs.” 5
Getting the elusive A cut guarantees hiih

a position at the NCAA Championships. With-

out it, only a small fraction of the next—fastest

swimmers —the B cuts — are added to ﬂesh _

out the event. .

Pittwill have a tune-up quad meet against
Clarion University, Grove City College and Cali-
fomiaUniversity of Pennsylvania next Saturday,
Feb. 4, at 11 a.m. at Trees Pool. It will be the
teams’ last meet before the Big East Champion-
ships are held on the following two weekends
at Trees Pool. I
