Devanath
ready to
lead council

Gretchen Andersen
Staﬁ" Writer

When members of the Pittsburgh
Student Government Council met to
decide who would chair the student
engagement and advocacy group, Nila
Devanath’s name made its way almost
unanimously around the table.

In the end, Devanath secured the
majority vote needed to put her at the
head of the citywide student govem-
ment group that has ‘recently champi-
oned student interest in controversial
issues like cuts in public transit.

As the Graduate and Professional
Student Assembly president, a Pitt
medical student, former Student Gov-

ernmentBoardmemberandnowchair- , -

woman for PSGC, Devanath said she
looks forward to serving both Pitt and
students in the greater Pittsburgh area
this year — especially when it comes
to the brewing Port Authority budget
troubles.»

Devanath, who originally didn’t
plan on rtmning because she has a
“full plate,” said she felthonoredwhen
she was nominated for and voted into
the position. Her term will end in late
June.

“Because of alltheworklhad loved
doingwiththe council, itdidn’tfeellike
too big of a step,” Devanath said.

After Notre Dame ended the Pitt
men’s basketball team’s quest for
the Big East tournament title
last season, the Panthers goal
in Monday night’s contest could
be summed up in one word: re-
venge.

But in a twist of fate, the No.
14 Fighting Irish (17-4, 6-3 Big
East) did it again. .

Notre Dame went home with
its first true road‘ victory of the
year and handed Pitt (19-2, 7-1
Big East) its first Big East loss
thisseason at the Petersen Events
Center in. a 56-51 victory. -

“[Notre»Dame] deserved to
win; they made the plays down
the stretch,” Pitt head coach Ja-
mie Dixon said after the game.

.“I’m just disappointed in how we

executed both offensively and
defensively, but Notre Dame had

a lot to do with that. Give them

credit.”

Just hours before the contest
against Notre Dame, Pitt rose to
No. 2 in the national polls. The
Panthers have won 51 of their
last 53 games at the Petersen
Events Center, two of which
wereagainst top—5 teams this
season.

toughest places to play in the

Life in lounges still sweet

Keith" Gillogly
Senior Staﬁ’ Writer

The dorm room that Pitt freshman Mark
Cunliffe shares with three roommates
sounds typicaland maybe a bit cramped:
There are four beds, desks and dressers,
two mini—fridges, a TV, a full-size couch
and even a small coffee table.

In fact, it’s neither typical nor crowd-
ed.

Cunliffe’s room is actually a spacious
lounge in Lothrop hall that wasconverted
into a living space. Cunliffe is one of 142 stu-
dents who were placed in non—traditional
rooms in the fall because the University

‘ overbooked residence halls for the second

year in a row.

Every year, the University predicts how
many accepted students will matriculate
and estimates the demand for on-campus
housing. Some years — such as this one
— see an abundance of students and not
enough rooms.

Nearly all of these 142 students are still
in their non—traditional rooms because,
“They were happy with these living ar-
rangements and freshmen space limita—
tions prohibited the move to more tradi-
tional rooms,” Pitt spokeswoman Patricia
Lomando White said in an e—mail.

This year, because of the demand for

housing, even some students who met the .

housing application deadline were placed
in non—traditional rooms, White said. The
University is looking to expand housing

with an addition to the University-owned

Bouquet Gardensapartments, the newest
part of which is scheduled to be open by fall
2011. Pitt is also in the process of designing

a new residence hall with a targeted open-
ing of fall 2013. .

The issue of overbooked residence
halls is not unique to Pitt. Geoff Rushton,
a Penn State University spokesman, said
Penn State students have also been placed
in converted lounges when residence halls
are full. Fourteen thousand of the school’s

43,000 undergraduate students live on

campus.

In 2006, Penn State had to deny housing
contractsto students, meaning converted
lounges still couldn’t accommodate the
totalnumber of students looking for on-
campus housing, Rushton said. Like Pitt,
Penn State also relies on number crunching
and prediction in planning housing. V

“It’s a science to some degree, but it’s
an inexact science,” he said.

To Cunliffe, alternative housing at Pitt ,

is almost a luxury. All the other rooms on
his ﬂoor are singles.

“[The room] is a huge space. It’s not
disappointing. If anything it’s kind of get-
ting spoiled,” he said.

White said the University will continue
to evaluate its housing on a year-by—year
basis. V

“If an overﬂow situation occurs in the
future, we will analyze all possible solutions
and make a decision based on the circum-
stances of that particular year,” she said.

. White said that the admissions process
should be more predictable in the future,
since the economy has begun to stabilize.
Though it’s too early to tell if this coming
fall’s new students will all be housed in
traditional rooms, White said they will be

notiﬁed that they might not receive a tra- A

ditional room if the University believes all
rooms will be occupied.

Cunliffe believes he did not receive a
traditional room because a friend whom
he applied to live with handed his housing
application in late. They ended up with a
few extra roommates, but he said that it
was no problem.

“If you apply to live with somebody
anyway, I guess you’re not really worried
about the roommate situation. If you were

Altern

really worried about privacy, you would
apply for a single,” he said.

Cunliffe and his roommates rearranged
their lounge—room to maximize ﬂoor space.
The beds originally sat bunked in the middle
of the room, until the freshmen un-bunked
them and positioned some againsfthe walls
to create more open space. _

And for four students in one room, the
place is quite clean. All the extra ﬂoor space
is free of discarded dirty laundry and piles
of pizza boxes. ,

Pitt freshman Nikola Boskovic, one of
Cunliffe’s roommates, handed in his hous-
ing application late after an Internet—relat-
ed mix—up. But he has also gotten used to
the roomy interior, something that he’ll
probably miss next year.

‘.‘Now that I have this much space, I don’t
know how it’s going to be next year. Regard-
less of where I go, I know I’m not going to
have this much space,” he said. ﬂ

the Port Authority cuts, establishing an official

she called ita“longshot” — creatingastate—wide

“The Port Authority issue is a concern for all
Pittsburgh students, and I want our students to

SGB President Molly Stieber, who serves as
Pitt’s undergraduate representative to the PSGC,
agreed with Devanath’s vision. Stieber said that
she and Devanath are working on plans to create
a petition for Pittsburgh students concerning the
P011: Authority service cuts scheduled for the end
of March.

Stieber also said that SGB has created a'I‘rans—

“Any reduction in Port Authority service is a

Tune in to Union

As Pitt basketball climbed to a No.
2 national ranking, it’s been un-
derstandably hard for students to
wrench their eyes from ESPN, no
matter what the justiﬁcation.

But at least regarding tonight’s‘
primetime TV, there’s no need for

the NCAA and President Barack

Obama to be mutually exclusive.
If you can locate a pause in the
action as the Buckeyes take on
the Boilermakers, you might ﬁnd
the annual State of the Union ad-
dress, broadcast on most major
networks, worthwhile. _

The new year is only begin-
ning to unravel, though college
students around the country are
already feeling the pinch of wors-
ening societal issues — _issues that
demand resolution. Despite a mas-
sive stimulus effort and a technical
“end” to the recession, unemploy-
ment still reigns, and conditions
are now worse for students than
they were before. According to the
Bureau of Labor Statistics, unem-
ployment among people younger
than 25 with bachelor’s degrees

has shot from less than 6 percent ,

two years ago to 9.6 percent in De-

cember, higher than the national

unemployment rate.
And when millions of Ameri-

‘ cans are scraping by without work,
. parents — and in the case of fed-

eral grants, taxpayers too — are
increasingly forced to shell out

’ massive sums to pay for balloon-

ing tuition rates.

This is all for a college edu-
cation that is underutilized (the
ﬁrst two years of college impart
no learning beneﬁts on more than
a third of students, according to a
recent NYU report) and in large
part is ﬁnancially unhelpful. The
Project on Student Debt reports
that average college students
grapple with $24,000 worth of
post—baccalaureate debt, and it’s
debt that will likely plague them

Opinions    

for years to come —, unless, of

course, they happen‘ to be in ac-
counting, computer science or the
lucrative new business of frackin
shale deposits. ‘ A
A host of other issues stand
poised to affect students as well.
As Senate Republicans have put
Obama’s 2009 health-care legisla-
tion in the crosshairs, young peo-
ple might lose the newfound right
to stay on their parents’ insurance
until the age of 26. Also, though
the national debt might not ﬁnd
itself on most students’ priorities,
the deﬁcit—reduction methods cur-
rently being fought over on Capitol
Hill — like raising taxes, downsiz-
ing the military and cutting other
government programs —- could

directly affect young people, either A

now or down the road. And don’t

' even get us started about post- .

stimulus state budget problems,
like the-Pennsylvanian version
that’s putting student-friendly Port
Authority buses in jeopardy.

. Sure to impact our generation,
these issues must be addressed

by various levels of government. '

Watching the State of the Union
address offers a basic diagnostic
of how the federal government
plans to solve our problems. It’s
a way to demand accountability
from elected leaders without get-

ting offthe couch (or out of the

Snuggie, since this is 2011).

No doubt the address has re-
ceived ﬂack in recent years for
having anold format and an un-
intended emphasis on the bitter
divides in Washington, D.C., (who
could forget Sen._]oe Wilson’s “You
lie!” exclamation from last year).
But considering how much young
people have invested in govern-
mental decisions to come, perhaps
keeping the TV on after “The Big-
gest Loser” might be worth your
time. If not, there’s always stream-
ing online. I

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

To the editor,

The social probation of Pitt sororities and fraternities is not a “crackdown” on Greek life but a serious

overreaction to harmless socializing. Although it was a mistake to bring alcohol to an event despite prior ,

knowledge that it was not permitted, to punish every member of Greek organizations is unjustiﬁed and an
inexcusable act by the University in an attempt to “make an example of” those who violate alcohol—related
rules/regulations. University officials and many of the independent student body don’t seem to have any in-

terest in all the philanthropic events, fundraisers and general productive do—good nature of Greek life. They

just like to condemn us when a handful of people — who happen to wear Greek letters —— make a mistake.
They, including The Pitt News, revel at the chance to associate today’s Greek life with that of “Animal House”
and othefﬁctitious, negative portrayals, when in fact we have moved very far from the “dark days” of alco-
holism, hazihg and lewdness. This is not to say that The Pitt News shouldn’t report on the situation, but to

- go around Oakland and upper campus spying on houses and then report about their activity is elementary

schoolplayground pettiness. I am very loyal to The Pitt News, often bragging about it to friends at other
universities whose school papers can’t compare, but I was very disappointed when I read the article.
Thank you for your time and consideration, ’

People tend to believe public opinion over science, one study reports

Stamatakis < 5

‘ a far more intense idea of the pulse of the nation
than ever before.

Although this might seem like a victory for
freedom of information, it. actually represents a
potentially dangerous trend. Knowingthe popular
position on certain ideas can actually cloud per-
sonal judgment and concrete facts. In late 2009,
researchers from the University of Maryland
conducted a study in which they explained the
unproven theory ofESP (extrasensoryperception)
topanicipants and thentoldthemthatitwas either

popular or not popularwith thepublic; and either" "

accepted or rejected by scientists.

When people were told that the theory was
rejected by science but popular with the public,
participants were very likely to agree with the

idea of ESP. Public opinion, in other words, beat
the word of scientists — anoutcome that doesn’t
speak positively for society’s advancement. And
nowthatthe public opinion on any subjectcanbe
so easily accessed, this trend will only expand.
One victimhas been the economy. The reces-
sion, after all, was partially caused by uaders col-
lectivelybelieving, againsttheirpersonalwisdom,
thateverybody could afford $3oo,ooo mortgages.
It isn’t necessarilythattheywere selﬁsh or dumb,
but that traders, bankers and investors all felt a

’lia11l<érs'or  seemedto have any problem
with the situation. The cycle fed on itself, despite
growing evidence of over-leveraged consumers
and risingforeclosures. Eventually, of course, the

systemfailed. l_

where with this issue is that masses don’t neces-
sarily have the right opinion in the ﬁrst place.

Traditionally, it is assumed that when people
make a judgment about anything, any error is
somehowdistributed sothatsomebody e1se’s opin-
ion cancels it out eventually. When one person
orders his porridge extra hot and another extra

cold, porridge producers will eventuallysee that
. certain sense of nctotltertradets,-...-youprobablywant your porridge ‘just right.”

Butwith public opinion, people don’t make in-
dependent decisions. Insteadof consciously noting
where previous errors were and self-correcting,
adherence to the public opinion locks people in.
Bad decisions nolonger cancel themselves out

and good ideas aren’t always the winners. The
majority, therefore, is not always correct. Yet as
shown by the Maryland study and the economy,
it still drives personal decisions.

Withthe newmediahereto stay, we needtobe
more conscious of when our opinions are being
driven by public opinion rather than logic and
reason. Sarah Palin, the South Beach Diet, Barack
Obarna, the Tea Party,-Justin Bieber and ‘Avatar’
alone all possibly owe some of their success, or , 

failures to public swelling that  wleican now

beware the phantom ofpublicwisdomand instead
be more willingto uust personal wisdom.

Tugboat Printshop
412-621-0663

298 Main Street,
Lawrenceville
www.tugboatprint-
shop.com

Fans of traditional mediums,

take note: Pittsburgh’s Tugboat T

Printshop hopes to rekindle the
often overlooked art of print-
making.

Located in nearby Law-
renceville, the shop is owned and
operated by Paul Roden and Val-

. erie Lueth, a husband and wife
‘duo that turns out a variety of

originally designed and hand-
made prints and woodcuts, each
one laden with intricate detail.

Printmaking has, according
to Pitt Studio Arts professor
Lenore Thomas, enjoyed a re-
surgance in popularity in recent

' years. Thomas — who teaches

several printmaking courses —

explained that there is a wide ap- ‘

peal to printmaking, both for the
artist and the potential buyer.

“Certainly the idea of acces-
sibility can beexciting to art-
ists. Print is often referred to as
the democratic medium because
the -artist can make multiples
and share them with lots of dif-
ferent people,” she said. “The
rise in popularity of street art
might be part of it. Also, the DIY
movement has made craft more
popular and people often lump
printmaking into a craft-based
art. Stores like Urban Outfitters
have sold mini screen—print and
relief-block kits.” p

Each print from Tugboat
Printshop is carefully designed
and drawn out by either Roden

V or Lueth. The two then finish ev-

homemade prints

ery project together, each taking
care of one aspect of the ﬁnal
version. _ .

Roden, who got his master
of fine arts degree in printmak-
ing from the University of South
Dakota, commented on the pro-
cess.

“We wo rk pretty well togeth-
er, and the work allows the pro-
cess to be collaborative. There
are about three levels of editing,
three to six prints going back and
forth. We’re each picking up one
after the other,” Roden said.

“We don’t mind sitting next
to one another,” Lueth joked —

each print can take several hours .

to complete. Before becoming
a printmaker, Lueth served as
an artistic designer for video
games.

When asked why they chose
printing — a noticeably older
method of producing graphic
art —~ both Roden and Lueth re-
sponded that there was a myriad
of reasons for their choice in
business. The most compelling
one was the c'raft’s blue—collar
sensibility. A

“It’s the grandfather of graph-
ic design —- a reproduction of
imagery that has a working-class
mentality,” Roden said.

“People\have a variety of rea-
sons for being drawn to print-
making. It can be very process-
orientated which some people
like and it is certainly hands—on.
Again, the ability to make a lot of
one image can also be appealing
to people. Each area of printmak-
ing has its own appeal,” Thomas
said. ,

Every major aspect of a
piece from Tugboat Printshop

, is produced in the couple’s Law-

renceville home, which doubles
as their studio.
“People should understand

everything we do is by hand,”

Roden said of the couple’s
work,

“We’ve had to work really
hard, put in a lot of energy and
effort,” Lueth said of the busi-

ness, which has been growing V

despite the economic downturn’s
unkindness toward the arts.
Thomas admitted that many
of her colleagues have struggled
over the past few years to sell

their work, citing the common,

mentality among buyers that art
is “a luxury andan unnecessary
expense in hard times.”

But the Tugboat Printshop
team managed to find a way to
keep its business up and run-
ning.

, “We took the approach that
we weren’t going to let it bother

us. We’re under our own direc-
tion, we’re in charge of our bot-
tom line,” Roden said. “I guess
we kind of have a ‘can-do’ atti-
tude.”

That attitude ﬂourished in
Pittsburgh, where the ever-grow-
ing art scene has provided an af-
fordable and receptive outlet for
the couple’s business, to which
both Lueth and Roden -—- who
moved to the city from South Da-
kota _— partially attribute their
success.

“Pittsburgh never got sucked

into the real-estate bubble. We
were priced out of every other
city, but Pittsburgh is very ac-
commodating.'The city should
really market itself as a heaven
for entrepreneurial, go—getting
young people. There really is a
lot going on here,” Roden said.
“When the economy does turn
around, we’ll see that we’ve re-
ally made something.”

FOOD COLUMN

Game—changing party snacks

Sarah Simkin
Columnist

There are many elements of a party you
have little or no control over: the weather,
who will actually show up, space constraints
and ‘whether your guests will get along, to
name just a few.

What you can do to ensure a delightful

I evening, however, is load up on party food

-— speciﬁcally, snacks. Ideally things you can
linger and chat over, like dips and various
dip accompaniments. .
My friend’s Doritos casserole clip has
made her the envy of the party circuit. It

i actually does nothing to help conversation,
since everyonehas their mouths full of chips .

V and vegetables until it’s devoured. But af-
terward, everyone is in a great mood. After
much bargaining, cajoling and threatening I
was ﬁnally able to procure her secret recipe
—— for you, dear reader, for you. "

just kidding, she totally just gave it to me
and was very nice about it. Thanks, Paula!

Doritos Casserole~“Dip

Crumble six cups of Doritos with your '

hands into a large mixing bowl. Trust me,
this is not awaste of perfectly good chips —
this dish is more than the sum of its parts.
Add two tablespoons of grated onions, one
‘ 10-ounce can of chili with beans, 10 ounces

' p of enchilada sauce, one 8-ounce can of to-

mato sauce and 1.5 cups of shredded sharp
cheddarcheese. ’ _
Stir until combined and then pour the
mixture into an oven—proof 8 1/2—by—11—inch
casserole dish —' the oven—proof part is cru-
cial! Bake for 20 minutes at 375 degrees.
Remove from the oven and cover with
one and one—quarter cups of sour cream,
half a cup of shredded cheddar cheese and
two additional cups of crumbled Doritos.
Bake for another ﬁve minutes and serve im-

. mediately, or chill and then heat up later. Or

serve it cold — whatever you like.

Salsa

Salsa packs a double whammy of deli-
ciousness and linguistic delight — try to
pretend that isn’t fun to say. A wide spec-
trum of ﬂavors from mild to outrageously,
unreasonably hot has been common for
years, but some food brands of late have
made forays into incorporating more exotic
fare, like fruit. .

The sweetness of fruit nicely comple-
ments salsa’s spicier elements. I’m partial
to Costco Santa Barbara Mango Peach salsa:
it’s delicious, the serving size is huge so
you’ll practically never run out and noth-
ing could be simpler than pouring the

readymade product into a bowl. Voila.

3 Onion Dip

You can buy sundry brands of onion
dip, but I prefer this homemade recipe
perfected by my father: Combine one
packet of onion powder with one 16—ounce
container of sour cream —— it’s that sim-
ple. Serve with earrots and potato chips.

Hummus

._ Hummus, one of the few dips free from

outrageously caloric ingredients, presents »

an appealing, nutritious alternative. You
can, of course, purchase it from the gro-
cery store, order it as takeout from one of

Oaklan_d’s ﬁne Middle Eastern restaurants '

or make it yourself. a
My family’s recipe involves combining

onecan of chickpeastogether with one -

quarter cup of olive oil, one teaspoon of
lemon juice, amounts of salt and pepper to
be determined by your personal preference
and a dash of paprika. Agfood processor or
blender is ideal, but in a pinch, you can just
mash them together with a fork.

For dipping, you can buy pita chips or
cut regular pitasinto Towers dorm-room-
shaped slices and lightly toast them. I

Steelers fans were respectful when they celebrated on Forbes Avenue after their team beat the Jets Sunday night in the AFC Championship game. An even greater celebration is
expected if the Steelers win the Super Bowl Feb. 6. ».

Tonyjovenitti
Sports Editor

 

When the Pittsburgh Steelers de-
feated the New Yorkjets 24-19 on
Sunday to win the AFC Champion-
ship, hundreds of people took to
the streets of Oakland to célebrate
the win.

It marks the eighth time the
Steelers have made it to the Super
Bowl — but, perhaps more im-
portantly, it also marked the 10th
“riot” in my four years at Pitt. 7

For my top 10 this week, I give
you a roundup of the most memo-
rable_ riots at Pitt in the past four

years — and the pros and cons of V

many of them.

M 10. 2011 AFC Championship.
This might have been the most
recent, but let’s faceit — it was
pretty sad compared to the rest.
There were only a couple hundred
people outside, and most of them
were simply trying to get on TV at
the corner of Forbes and Bouquet.
But let’s give Pitt students a break.
After all, AFC Championships
aren’t that unique anymore.

9. (3-20 Summit. This wasby
far the most insane riot, and it
is one of only three non—sports-
related riots on this list. V

The police presence in Oakland .

was unprecedented, and the legal
system is still working out some of
the arrests. But I’m placing it near
the bottom of my list simply be-
cause this was an angryriot. The
best ones are celebratory.

8. Pitt vs. No. 10 South Flori-
da in 2008. I’m still not sure why
Pitt students decided to take to
the streets to celebrate this win.

Pitt was 3-1 heading into«Tampa '
for the matchup with the top—10.

Bulls. The Panthers lost to Bowl-

ing Green‘ in the ﬁrst game. But

forsome reason, beating USF on

the road was a big enough deal to ‘I

celebrate at the Cathedral.

7. 2009 AFC Championship.
This AFC Championship celebra-
tion easily trumped Sunday’s
events. The 2009 edition actually
shut down the streets. Perhaps
it was more exciting because the
Philadelphia Eagles — who have
a solid fan presence on Pitt’s cam-

pus -- had lost -the NFC Cham-
pionship a few hours earlier and
Steelers fans felt the need to rub
it in Eagles fans’ faces.

6. Phillies 2008 World Se-
ries Championship. Since east-
ern Pennsylvanians make up such
a large portion of Pitt students,
when the Phillies won the 2008
World Series overtthe Tampa Bay
Rays, the celebrations reached
Steelers-AFC-Championship-like
proportions. In fact, Phillies fans
even stormed the Hillman Library
to let the world know how happy

V they were.

5. 2008 SempleFest. Before
the police decided to crack down
on the annual end—of—spring—

-. semester tradition, the 2008

version of the giant party known
as SempleFest simply got out of
control. The party went from a
few hundred people early in the
afternoon to a few thousand peo-
ple by the evening. Fires were lit
and a Pitt tradition was ruined.
Nonetheless, it was crazy and
exciting.

4. 2009 Stanley Cup Cham-
pionship. The Penguins beat
the Detroit Red Wings in a thrill-
ing seven-game series in June of
2009. Oakland quickly erupted
into revelry, but since it was sum-
mertime, it just'wasn’t the same
as regular, academic-year riots.
Still, it established Pittsburgh as
the “City of Champions” thanks
to the Steelers’ Super Bowl win
earlier in the year.

3. 2008 Presidential Elec-
tion. Regardless of your political
views, the celebrations surround-
ing Barack Obama’s campaign vic-
tory in 2008 were purely joyous.
That’s the reason it is so high on
this list —— because it was the most
peaceful “riot” of them all. Noth-
ing was lit on ﬁre and the only
disruption was the temporary
closing of Forbes Avenue. Per-
haps students should take notes
on this one in case the Steelers
win on Feb. 6.

2. 13-9. When 4-7 Pitt defeated
No. 2-ranked West Virginia —
with a score of 13-9 -— on Dec.
1, 2007, I witnessed the ﬁrst riot
of my collegiate career. Hav-

ing Forbes Avenue shut down in
the freezing rain over a football
game deﬁnitely made for one of
the most exciting events of my
freshman year.

1. 2009 Super Bowl Cham-
pionship. This was certainly not
the most peaceful of the riots, and
it wasn’t very surprising. But it
was simply the biggest riot to hit
Pitt since 2007. Just seconds after
the Steelers defeated the Arizona
Cardinals, the streets of Oakland
were jam-packed with thousands
of people celebrating the win.

Unfortunately, a few bad apples
lit things on ﬁre and destroyed
bus stops — hopefully that won’t
happen in two weeks — but it was

still the most exciting riot of the

past four years.

Editor’s Note; The Pitt News
does not condone unruly behavior
due to sportingvictories. Students
who celebrate violently‘, destroy
property or otherwise violate the
Student Code of Conduct could
be subject to punishment by the
University or, in some cases, the
legal system. .

get a ‘W’ really says something,” Irish
guard Ben Hansbrough said. “This is
the probably best win I’ve had, maybe
ever.”

It took moreithan luck for Notre Dame
to beat Pitt on their home court after so
many losses on the road, though. Irish
head coach Mike Brey said he speciﬁcally
planned for the kind of style Pitt plays.

“I’m really proud of our group to learn
the process of winning on the road, and
this was the ultimate road‘ challenge for
us,” Brey said. .

Notre Dame’s approach was to slow
down Pitt’s intensity by stalling in the
half-court set.and reducing possessions.
The Irish consistently held the ball to the

near end of their possession clock and

then made their move to the hoop.

. “We talked about meeting the home,

team’s competitive energy. I thought we
did that,” Brey said. “We certainly ex-
ecuted our game plan of burning clock and
executingat the end of the clock.”

The Notre Dame game plan was ex-
ecuted by a starting line-up of ﬁve seniors.
Hansbrough, probably the biggest con-
cern for the Panthers going into the game,
averages 18 points a game and scored ‘28
points against Marquette on Saturday.

The contest against Pitt was no dif-
ferent. Both Nasir Robinson and Brad
Wanamaker guarded Hansbrough at vari-
ous points during the game, but he still
managed to score 19 points — including
six key points to build ‘Irish momentum

. down the stretch.

“Ben was just fabulous ﬁnding people,
dragging the ball screen, understanding
the mismatch and ﬁnding our shooters,”
Brey said.

In what was a relatively low-scoring

   
   

  Hansbrough key in Irish win»

I game, the Panthers could not seem to

adjust to the different styleof play and
lacked the intensity seen against Syra-
cuse. .

Notre Dame limited Ashton Gibbs to
only.nine points, with Gilbert Brown and
Brad Wanamaker contributing 13 and 12
points, respectively. - A -

Brown said Pitt did not play the type
of basketball it normally does, and that
worked against the team.

“It was us rushing [the ball] and being

‘ impatient,” Brown said. “There was a little

selfishness, and just not being able to do
what‘ we did in the past games thatgot
us here. We did a lot of things_ that were
uncharacteristic of ourselves  and that’s
the reason why we lost.” .

The Panthers,’ who usually dominate
their opponent on the boards, did so again
tonight by a 29-23 margin. But this time
simply o,ut—rebounding the opponent
wasn’t enough. , .

Gary McGhee was muscled under the
hoop by forward and ‘Irish difference-
maker Carleton Scott, who scored 16
points and shot 5—of—6 from beyond the
arc. Scott Martin also contributed 10
points to. the Irish effort. —

Scott’s scoringjcoupled with Hans-
brough proved too much for the Panthers
to handle, and after losing momentum
with just minutes remaining in the second
half, they were unable to recover it.

“It’s one loss. I know a lot will be made
of it, and We’re used to that,” Dixon said.
“We’ll learn from it, and I think we’ll be
better because of it. We have to be.”

The Panthers are set to take on Rutgers

in New Brunswick, N.]., on Saturday. Tip-

off is set for 8 p.m. I
