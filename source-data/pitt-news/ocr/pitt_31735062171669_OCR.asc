Book Store ‘Profit’ Clarified

by KATHY MCCANN

An issue of major interest to
many students is the $26.Ut)0 prof-
it accrued b_v the l.‘niversity book
Center.

At an informal meeting in his
office on Tuesday. Dave Brewer.
\'ice-Chancellor of Finance. the
manager of the bookstore. Mrs.
Mary Bonach. and members of
the bookstore board sought to
clarify the situation.

According to Brewer. the book-
store borrows all of its working
capital from the L'niversit_v at the
going interest rate. fleexplained
that the 3526.000 in question» was
a net gain after the loan and inter-
est were repaid to the University.

He preferred to term the mon-
ey a “lack of deficit.”

In an effort to ultimately oper-
ate independentl_v of the L'nivers1-
ty. the bookstore. Brewer stated.
will retain the, profit as working
capital for the next year. There-
fore. the 3526.000 gain will serve
as so much less money to be bor-
rowed from the l'niversity.

If the money were refunded
back to the students. Brewer ap-
proximated each divivend to
amount to 18c a person. '

Concerning the prices the book-
store charges, Mrs. Bonach
stressed that the retail prices

I that students pay are fixed by the

publisher and are uniform across
the country.

The bookstore receives a 2t) per
cent discount on textbooks. flow-
ever. reported the manager. tlte
bookstore also supports a 26 per
cent overhead. In addition. the
store must pay all postage and

compensate for overorders and
tltefts.
Since more than half of the

bookstore volume is textbooks. a
losing item. the store makes up
the difference between their dis-
count and the overhead by mark-
ing Up the price of supplies and
the trade books on the first floor.
explained Brewer.

The manager delineated a few
services rendered by the book-
store which keep it in the red and
which could be considered evi-
dence of its non-profit status: 1)
54 per cent of its business deals
with textbooks which lose mon-
ey; 2) time-consuming student
charge accounts are handled for
those on scholarships; 3) the
store is open 61 hours a week,
longer than any other in the area;

and 4) job opportunities are pro-
vided for students.

In response to price compari-
sons between the l'niversity Book
(‘enter and the Oakland (‘o-op.
Brewer remarked that the (‘o-op
is operated on a volunteer basis
and suffers a low overhead.

Recent rumors and allegations
concerning - massive drug. arrests
on the l'nivei'sity campus were
shown to be unfounded at a meet-
ing Tltursda_v afternoon between
students and John Vrana. direc-
tor of Ilniversity llousing; Bern-
ard liobosky. vice—chancellor of
Student Af'f'airs. and Robert Mer-
rit. superintendent of l‘niversity

.\lerrit informed the students
present that only one drug arrest
had been made on campus. This
arrest. which was"made in the
Student Union on \\'ednesda_v. was
tnade by two members of the Uni-
versity Police Force. The three
administrators pointed out that
arrests made off" campus. even if
they were of students. were not
under their jurisdiction.

The Student Association Com-
missioners. however, pointed out
that in the past week there have
been numerous “busts” in the
Oakland community. ‘ The Com-
missioners explained that there
have been ten students and seven
non-students arrested for drugs

Merrit saw the reason for this,

as being the fact that the Univer-

considered by some a “sane-

ficials. “The city has full jurisdic- .5‘s,;" .
tion over this campus. Any city‘

for business. They do not have to‘

this point, he stated,‘ “There is no

Laux, who also helped to plan
the intramural program, had sim-
ilar ideas. “In order for the CA to
get off the ground, we need the
backing of the students, more

intramur-
als,” he said.

tion. If elected. Kasprzyk. a staff
member of the Magic Bus, a men-

said. "I've been told there is only
$6000 left in the SG treasury. so
we don't have much to work with.”

Michalik also maintains that
the new Constitution makes fu-
ture plans uncertain. since the re-
sponsibilities of the SG commis-
sioners are not clearly defined.
His solution for the problem is for
the commissioners to work close-
ly together.

“Our plan is to have regular

equalize the powers of each com-
missioner. The meetings will also

PLACEMENT SIGN-UPS
PROCEDURES CHANGED

Decreased compan_v visits and
higher senior registration have in-
creased student difficulty in
"signing-up" on various corporate
schedules. said E. S. Holmok. di-
rector of the University Place-
ment Service. Some students
haven‘t been able to get on the in-
terviewing schedules.

In order to be certain that a
larger number of students receive
as many interviews. as possible. it
will be necessary to limit first day
registration to two per student.

Effective Monday. Feb. 1. at
219 Schenley Hall «the Placement
Service) students may come in be-
ginning at 7:30 a.m. to receive a
numbered card. which will per-
mit everyone to come in on a first-

The new Academic Commis-
sioner also plans to begin study on
registration procedures by re-
viewing the methods the Univer-
sity has examined and by talking
to students for suggestions.

Michalik added that though he
is less experienced than the other
commissioners. he plans to get
things done. "I'm just a quiet en-
gineer and not much of a politi-
cian. But I believe I will be an
able administrator who will fight
for sound proposals that are in
the best interests of Pitt students.

Stipends Available

by BILL KACAYNSKI

Students interested in studying abroad this summer have a wide
variety of fields and programs to chose from. Group as well as individ-
ual study opportunities are available. in the shape of formal university
courses. study tours. and international student forums.

Different combinations of travel and study exist in various pro-
grams. and others can be designed by the student. Information on un-
dergraduate summer study can be obtained from Patrick .\lechem of
the Study Abroad Office in 1102 Bruce Hall.

There are many other sources of information. none of which is
completely exhaustive. Departmental bulletin boards are cluttered
with leaflets advertising various programs.

The catalogues of many foreign schools are on the ground ‘floor of
Hillman Library, and answer questions relating to the nature of
courses, tuition, and living conditions. Instructors with overseas
study experience can offer botli information and advice.

To obtain University credit. a student must design a program ap-
proved by the University prior to beginning study abroad. The student
should first have his course outline endorsed by his academic advisor.

and then receive final approval from Mrs. Rhea Bass in the Office of

the Dean. 917 Cathedral. 1

For the student wishing to participate in a group travel-study pro-
gram. many U.S. university——and organization-sponsored programs are
available. particularly in Europe. Many of these same universities and
organizations offer scholarships and loans. and can be applied for
when applying for admission. Applications for Nationality Room Schol-
arships are still being accepted by Mrs. Maxhine Bruhns in 1102 Bruce
Hall.

It is possible to study in many foreign universities independently.
However, application usually presupposes a working knowledge of the
language of the host country.

Those intending such study can directly contact the institution
they are interested in attending. Enclosure of an International Reply
Coupon, which can be obtained at any U.S. Post Office. will facilitate
a prompt reply.

Charter flights. sponsored by the Office of Cultural and Education-
al Exchange are being offered this summer from Pittsburgh to Paris.

Although deadlines for application to West German universities
are between May 1 and mid-July, it is important to write as early as
possible. Most courses are limited in size and accommodations are not
always abundant.

Special programs for foreigners. such as the Goethe Institute in
the Federal Republic. require application six months before beginning
study. Professor James Campbell in Ill Loeffer Hall of the Germanics
Departnent has further information.

Pitts Black Studies Department has a summer program in Tan-
zania. Area language studies are a prerequisite. For further details.
contact Dr. Jack Daniel of the Black Studies Department on 400 South
Craig.

Information on study in Russia and East Europe can be obtained
from Mrs. Rose Mary Pease of the Center for International Studies in
G7A Social Science Building. Individual study is severely limited in this
area, and application should be made as soon as possible.

The Experiment in International Living Program: allows students
to live with faniiiies abroad while studying. Another program is the
World Campus Afloat. Classes are taught on board ship and excursions
are organized in various ports.

VICE CHANCELLOR Bernard Kobosky and other University officials listened attentively as students air their gripes

about various University policies.

Students Meet Kobosky

_ by JANE HENDERSON
A second “coffee” given by
Vice Chancellor for Student Af-

fairs Bernard Kobosky and a pan-

el of several other administrators
to air and answer student gripes
was held in Dining‘ Room A of the
Student Union on Wednesday.

The most timely topic of the two
hour. session concerned the ac-
tions of alleged narcotic agents
who have been on and around
campus this week. Lenny Klavon-
ic. Social Commissioner. said.
"One apartment was ripped apart
in a search for dynamite——with-
out a warrant." He also said that
some athletes had been "busted“
two nights previously. and declar-
ed that in one raid. a female stu-
dent at Duquesnes Law School
had just walked into an apart-
ment and was arrested.

Kobosky agreed that these inci-
dents should be investigated thor-
oughly and the people involved
quesuoned.

When Marc Hiller suggested

that the University hire up to two
or three attorneys to handle stu-
dent legal affairs, Klavonic pro-
posed having one working for free
through the Student Government.
A proposed SG bail-bond fund was
brought up by Dennis Concilla,
Program Commissioner, and he
added that an effort was being
made to have severalgroups do-
ing benefits for such a fund.

The question of a black athletic
administrator was brought up by
Wade Lawson. Committees Coin-
missioner. Kobosky informed
the group that the committees in
charge was meeting on Thursday
night. It is to be chaired by Dr.
Donald Henderson.
Provost. and Dr. Lloyd Bell. di-

rector of Urban and Community-

Services. and is to include the
chairman of the Black Action So-
ciety. Kobosky. the track coach.
and several prominent black
alumni.

On the uncompleted bus slici-
ters. Kobosky stated. ‘‘I‘m as con-

Associate.

cerned as anyone. The contractor
was called to an emergency job.

but has said that the shelters will ‘-

be done by Feb. 8." In the discus-
sion that followed. it was pointed
out that what had started out as a
$2.500 jobhas turned into a $20.-
000 one.

In reply to a Student Union
Board member’s question about
space in the Student Union, Wil-
liam Markus, director of Student
Activities, assured that the space
problem would be reviewed when
the Counselor Education and Math
Departments move out, possibly
in April. Until then no real moves
are possible.

Concerning student represen-
tation on the Board of Trustees.
Kobosky related. "Mr. Rea
(chairman of the Board» has
agreed to student representatives
on the Boards sub-committees.“
Klavonic agreed. “The sub—com-
mittee is where all the work is
done. The Board is just a rubber
stamp."

of smoking. -

It is no secret that some Pitt students
smoke grass and hash. Herefore it
seems that this was tolerated just as a
bottle of Bali Hai or Ripple in the dormi-
tories might be. But in researching to
find out just how hot things had gotten at
the University concerning drug arrests,
our four SG. Commissioners say ’ that
more dangerous elements than. just grass
or hash have hit campus. They cite this
as one of the reasons -for a drug crack-

- down, which they say is very evident off-

campus.

Junkies have. according to our com-
missioners migrated onto the University
campus—seeking the sanctuary they
think it could ‘provide. Junkies bring
pushers. pushers in. turn bring the man
to the campus. and. of course. the man

on campus means bust-time and more

stringent and enforced rules: ‘ ' .

We all should be in agreement that
heroin and other like drugs have no place
on the University of Pittsburgh campus
(or anywhere else for that matter). A so-

QUESTION: “Were you present at

the Prologue Program debate Saturday?” ‘

ANSWER: “I didn’t know there was
one." ' - '

I QUESTION: “Are you aware of
what the Prologue Program is?”

ANSWER: “Not really.”

QUESTION: “Have you ever. even
heard of the Prologue Program‘_.”’

ANSWER: “No.”

The questions were asked Tuesday '

night. The interviewee was not an ordi-
nary Pitt student." He was the new
Academic Commissioner of Student Gov-
ernment -— Ted Michalik.

One of Michalik's colleagues in
Student Government. Mike Hout. was
better informed. Hout. the new Chair-

man of the College of Arts and Scien-,

ces Cabinet. knew about the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences debate.

As a matter of fact. Hout had pled-
ged. during his recent campaign. that

his “first priority." if elected. would be

to secure passage of the Prologue Pro-
gram (Pitt News — January 18.1971).

The debate Saturday waslif not mo-
mentous. extended. Dean Jerome Schn_ee-

wind of the College of Arts and Scien-,

ces and former Student Government
President Scott Baum ~wer_e among
those who argued in favor of the Pro-
gram — which. in the end. was,"recom-
mitted" or. tabled until revised.

The"hard-drug pusher, particulary at
this time is your enemy. He is drawing
the police to you. The pusher on Pitt’s

‘campus must go . . . now. .

Your elected Student Government
Commissionersand the Pitt News con-
demn the use and sale of hard narcotics
in the University and the community‘
which surrounds it. This includes heroin.

cocaine. morphine. dilaudid and the like.

The existance of these type of drugs
on campus is detrimental to all of us
and we urge all students to aid in getting
them away from our community.

While not condemning, neither will
we condone the use or sale of acid, mes-
caline, marijuana, or hashish. They are a
matter of individual decisions. The Pitt
News would not tell a person to smoke a
joint, anymore than it would tell him to
go to the nearest bar, and buya vodka and
orange juice. We can see a strong case

_for legaland) social exceptions made con-
cerning marijuana and‘ hashish, _but,

again, we see their use as purely a‘ per-
sonal decision. ‘ -
Butﬁback to heroin and the pusher. If
you know of a hard-drug pusher on cam-
pus. threaten to bust him—scare him «if

it reaches a crises. do bust him)—but

Despite his campaign promise, how-
ever, Hout wasnot present at the de-
bate. Instead, h_e was 150 miles away, at
Brady’s Bend, where he was reported to

be spending some time “in the woods.”

Defending himself. Hout explained
that Baum was "better versed" in the
Prologue Program than he was. Besides.
he added. "in retrospect. I-don't think
I would have had any effect."

That" may be true: And. after all.
who expects a politician to keep a pro-
-mise‘.’ ‘ A_ V »

One has to wonder. thoughjwhether

’ Hout and Michalik‘real‘ly care. And if

they don‘t. why the hell did they run
for student representative in the first
place? ’
Granted, some of ~ their opponents
in the recent Student Government elec-
tion were not exactly stunning public
servants, or even prospective ones. As a

matter of fact, members of the Pitt‘

News editorial board, which endorsed
both Michalik and Hout, might -very
well be in hiding today, were it not for
the fact that we can vividly recall the
foiles of the others who ran.

’ At least. as my roommateiaptly
pointed "out. Hout and Michalik are
true "representatives of»Pitt students."

‘But can students be blamed for
snickering at “Student Government"
when neither the Academic Commis-
sioner nor the Chairman of the College
of Arts and Sciences Cabinet was pre-

 

At other times.

the ‘Presi-
dents proposals sound good. but

You say.‘ you can"t_see anything at all
wrong with smoking a little bit of mari-
juana now and then? Well you better get
that man selling the harder stuff out of
here. cause he's making the temperature
very. very warm.

The commissioners have said that
there are narcotics agents in number

’ around the campus. Clean-up and be

careful. No matter how much you
might believe that smoking marijuana.is
not wrong, you're still breaking the law,
and you can go directly to jail.

Get the junkie and pusher off campus

'—-out of the community. Their bad for

you in many of ways.

Again. we must make it clear that

neither the ‘Pitt News nor the Student
Government Commissioners are in-
striicting students or members» of the‘
community to smoke dope. In the case of
the harder drugs we are in fact telling the
student to stay as far away as he can pos-
si_blyget. No one can deny the controveri-
ality of _some of the other drugs but we
still say that concerning these lesser
drugs. the decision rests with the individ-
ual alone.

Just make sure for a while_that you
are clean and stay clear of the pusher.

sent at a debate on a major proposal
.for academic reform‘? .

Hout‘ claims he "didn't know the
vote was going to be taken Saturday."
And yet he talked with Baum before
‘Saturday.
familiar with -parliamentary procedure
‘ to know that a vote was likely to follow
debate. he should have asked.

As for Michalik’s‘ ignorance, it is
appalling at best. At least, he cannot be

accused of reneging on a promise, since’

he wasn't aware of the Prologue Pro-
gram to begin with. But couldn’t he
ha_ve skimmed through a Pitt News is-
sue to find out that a vote was coming
up? Our journalism isn’t that insipid,
is it?

I'm not suggesting that Hout-and
Michalik deserve a wrist-slapping. I‘m
not even sure they should go _to bed
without supper.

But if they want our respect. cooper-
ation. and attention. they will have to
work for it. ‘

The fact that they are students‘-I
doesn't make them immune from criti-"

cism.

If the negligent administrator and
uninformed faculty member can be
‘rebuked. so can students whose behav-
ior suggests that our generation is no
more honest, aware. or responsible than
that which preceded it.

Yet, centrism has its disad-
vantages. It tends to follow the

perceived ethos of opinion,
‘ thereby leading to policy-
making “as the - crow flies.”

Lacking any firm anchor point‘

on which to base his actions,
the centrist is forced into mak-

‘ing ad-hoc decisions on politi-

cal questions,‘ the outcome de-
pending not upon principle,
but on political expediency.

Perceiving the political wind

to be blowing in a certain dir-

ection. and stung by criticism
from the communications-aca-
demic complex. Nixon apparent-
ly has embarked upon the pro-
per couse from a centrist
point of view. i.c. Go. where
the votes are «or where he
thinks they are ).

Viewed in this light. then. at
least part of his "State of the
Union" Message is more easily
understood. Consider for a mo-
ment his new health care plan.
It is well-known that Ted Ken-
nedy will introduce a compre-

l

   

 

billion. So what does Nixon do‘?
He introduces, a plan. but his
will cost only. say $15 billion.
Satisfied everyone‘? "

 

Ditto considerations apply to
his Family Assistance Proposal.
Some want a $5,000 -guaranteed
income, others oppose this con-
cept. Predictably, Nixon tries
a middle course; he asks for
$1,500 and couches it in fancy
rhetoric,‘ calling it “Workfare"
rather than welfare, which is
.what it really is. _, ‘

 

 

upon closer examination... have
little substance. His government
reorganization plan. which he
calls “sw.eeping“. is nothing
more than a massive juggling of
Federal bureaucrats. Rather than
Bureaucrat A and Bureaucrat
B retaining impressive cabinet-
level titles. only Bureaucrat
A will have the title. but don‘t
worry. Bureaucrat B. you'll keep
your 3330.000 a year job. Anoth-
er example of centrism‘? No-
where was there any mention
of eliminating some depart-
ments and reducing the size of
a government that Nixon else-
where had called “an unwieldy
monster." One wonders why
changing a few names would
make it more "wieldy.“
Likewise, the revenue shar-
ing proposal is a red herring.
Anyone who seriously believes
that the Federal government.
will allocate money to anyone

a short-term solution.

Furthermore, what difference
does it make to a poor black
(or white) whether it is the state
or Washington that administers
an urban renewal project; chan-
_ces are, he’ll be evicted from
his dwelling to make way for
a Chatham_ Center no matter
who’s in charge.

Finally. Nixon has apparently
forgotten that people or govern-
ments will always find new
ways of spending money so that
their "needs“ are never satis-
fied. Pitt is a striking example
of this fact.

At times. Nixon sounds like
Franklin Roosevelt. For the
past two years he has blamed

LBJ‘s massive deficits for the.

current-inflaltion and unemploy-
ment. His current proposal: A
Federal deficit more massive
($15 billion) than every LBJ

something“ about the economy.

Thank ’Pitt’

Editor, The Pitt News:

The Allequippa, Breckenridge,
and Avalon Streets Block Club
would like to express appreciation
and thanks to The Pitt News and
to the many ‘Pitt students who
voiced their views concerning the
proposed hillside dorm.

The community is very con-

. cerned about the impact the dorm

will have on the area. But, it also
realizes the great need that exists
for decent student housing for the
students. Members of the com-
munity are working with both

‘Peoples Oakland and Model Cities

to help solve this problem.

The commune next to Falk
School has shown for example that
‘students and community can live
and work together in a harmonious
and creative way. Perhaps the
smaller individual type housing
such as this would make it easier

for the community and the stu-

dents to get to know and under-
stand one another better.

The results of the public hear-

E ing held Jan. 21 have not appear-

ed yet. But. what ever the results

this neighborhood and all of Oak-

land have discovered an ally in
making Oakland a better place to
live. the Pitt student.

Sincerely.
Richard Henius

President. Allequippa.
Breckenridge. Avalon Sts.

Mme Drivel Chapman Applauded

From Ging
Editor. The Pitt News:

This is in response to Bob
Ging‘s article “Do Pitt Students
Actually Give a Damn About Any-
thing." Well, Bob, you sure out
did yourself. didn't you? I’ve read
your drivel for two years, but that
column really smelled.

Why should Pitt students give
a damn? Last year's election turn-
ed into a real side show. First.
one election wasn‘t right because
not everyone was eligible to vote.
The second election went away
because of a technicality con.-
cerning campaign publicity.

So after most of the campus
split for the summer. spontane-
ous generation occurs and lo and
behold a new SG president. Man.
that‘s a real mandate from the
people. Then there was the “Con-
cert of the Month" idea. Out-a-
sight right‘?

Definitely. Physically so.
Frankly. I think the idea was pub-
licized to get everyone‘s mind off
the Three Stooges-like election.
I‘m convinced that some clicque‘s
running the show. and that we're
all here to rubber stamp the whole
diarrhetic mess.

Dr. John W. Chapman
Department of Political Science
Dear Dr. Chapman:

1 have read your remarks in
The University Times with re-
spect to the proposed mentor
group system that will soon be de-
cided upon by the University. Af-
ter reading your views. I feel
compelled to write and tell you
how very much I agree with you.
Like you. I am appalled by the ten-
dency of many faculty members
at Pitt to turn the University ex-
perience into one large.sensitivit_v
session.

I am presently a full-time day
student at Pitt and am a junior.
I began my college career in the

School of General Studies and only

recently transferred to the day
school. At the time of my trans-
fer. I became awarevof what I feel
to be a great disparity between
the general atmosphere of eve-
ning school and that of day school.

In general. evening school stu-
dents seem to be interested in
their studies. Many day school
students do not seem interested
in their studies at all. In fact.
many of them seem indifferent if
not downright hostile.

Faced with this lack of interest,
many professors seem to react by
backing away from what they
know their role to be. Like the
parents who are unable to say
“no" to domineering children,
these professors “give in” ‘to
their lethargic students. Instead
of insisting upon academic excel-

that such discussions could be

What then is the value of the Uni-

never see the extremes to which
the current silliness will be car-

perfectly. I wish you well in your
efforts to retain some semblance
of sanity at Pitt.

Yours very truly.

Editor. The Pitt News:

When Paul LeBlanc writes (The
Pitt News, Jan. 20) that conser-
vatives “quietly accept the mas-

sive power of U.S. corporations“
lie. that they are not concerned
with the power of monopolies).
that they “offer hymns to human
reason and virtue worthy of the
most naive 18th century philoso-
phy.“ and that they offer the stat-
us quo as a utopia. I can conclude

only that he is abysmally ignor-

ant of conservative and libertari-
an thought. for anyone familiar
with that thought could not possi-
bly make such statements——unless
his intention was to be deliberate-
ly misleading.

And by the way. George Orwell
wrote 1984 at the end of his life.
when he had become disgusted
with socialism: “When a man like
Orwell begins to see what state
socialism really must become . . .
he writes 1984, grits his teeth and
dies.“ From Russell Kirk‘s essay
in Intercollegiate Review, Fall
1968.

Le Blane No “Liberal?

To the editor. The Pitt News:

Daniel Arico must really have

been upset by my column to de-
nounce me (a
Marxist) as no better than a lib-
eral! In his letter to The. Pitt
News he also claims that I dis-
tort conservative views when I
note that conservatives "quietly
accept the massive power of U.
S. corporations.“

Mr. Arico edits Cassandra, the
monthly newsletter of the West-
ern Pennsylvania Young Ameri-
cans for Freedom. I urge him to
peruse the back issues of his
own newsletter, The Pitt News
columns of YAF member Frank
Donatelli, the pages of National
Review, and the writings of such
mainstream conservatives as
William Buckley, Frank Meyer.
Russell Kirk, Jeffrey Hart, etc.
(Not to mention the statements
of right-wing political heroes
such as Nixon, Agnew. Reagan.
etc.) ' ‘

He will find much verbiage
against “p0rnography," liberals.

new left. campus reform strug-
gles, the women‘s liberation
movement, hippies, Marxism, the
black liberation movement, var-

Security a

Editor, The Pitt News:

We are resident students living
in the Towers, where we have
long noticed a lack of security.
These feelings were reinforced
by the recent robbery in Tower
B. Luckily, no one was hurt, but
the consequences could have
been much more grave. We re-
alize that the security doors were
not in operation at the time,
however. even if they had been,
it is doubtful that the thieves
would have been denied entry.

Rather than preventing the en-
try of intruders. the doors now
serve only to hinder bona fide
residents in their entry.

We suggest. therefore, that the
identification of persons passing
through the doors be checked as

ious labor struggles. Communism.
etc.. etc. ‘

But he will find scant support
for his claim that conservatives
are also attacking the power of
U.S. corporations. Nor will he
find diatribes against the Na-
tional Association of Manufac-
turers, the American Medical As-
sociation, or the military-_indus-
trial lobby.

Mr. Arico claims to be oppos-
ed to the power of U.S. corpora-
tions, the NAM. the AMA, etc.
Yet this is a minority position
among U.S. conservatives; what’s
more, although he‘d prefer what
he calls a "free market“ to our
corporate economy, he offers no
ideas on how to actually break
the power of the corporations.
Words butter no persnips.

Finally, Mr. Arico writes that
the problems of black people
"are not amenable to group ac-
tion, particularly action of a vio-
lent nature.” This implies tha’
groups like the Black Action So-
ciety and people like myself
are calling for violence when-
ever we point to the need for
group action on the part of op-
pressed groups in society. In
this he is being less than honest.

by GEORGE PUTNAM

The biggest mistake we have made has been to
allow ourselves to drift into a state of mental stag-
nation. apathy. and inaction.

All around us we hear the word-—revolution——
revolution. And indeed. I think it is time for revolu-
tion—I mean a revolutionary change in our Amer-
ican state of mind.

And what is wrong with our state of mind? Well.
first and foremost, we have been thinking the way
the Communist want us to think.

We are confused over such fundamental prob-
lems as coexistence, disarament free trade, the
United Nations, recognition of Red China, and a
host of related prob’ ms.

And instead of maintaining a state of intellectual
vigilance, we h 'e taken Communist slogans as a
major premise for too many of our conclusions.

January 10, 1963, the following was recorded in
the U.S. Congressional Record:

“The Current Communist Goals”——and it was
taken from a book written by Cleon Skousen, The
Naked Communist.

Skousen began his extensive study of Commun-
ism during his 16 year term of service with the Fed-
eral Bureau of Investigation.

Following is an evaluated list of Skousen‘s
points: /

“Permit free trade between all nations, regard-
less of Communist affiliations, and regardless of
whether or not items could be used for war.” Accom-
plished.

“Resist any attempt to outlaw the Communist
Party.” Accomplished.

“Give Russia access to the U.S. Patent Office.” Ac-
complished.

“Use technical decisions of the courts to weaken

basic American institutions, by claiming their activ-
ities violate civil rights.” Accomplished.
“Gain control of schools, using them as tranmis-

sion belts to socialism and Communist propaganda.”
At least partially actomplished.

“Gain control of student newspapers.” At least
partially accomplished.

“Use student riots to foment public protest.” At
least partially accomplished.
“lnfiltrate the press.” Partially accomplished.
“Get control of key positions in radio, TV, and mo-

tion pictures.” in many instances, yes, that has been
accomplished.

“Discredit American culture and replace it with, _

trash.
H I . . .
Promote ugliness, repulsive and meaningless art.

“Eliminate all laws governing /obscenity under the
guise or censorship.

“Promote pornography, obscenity in books, maga-
zines, motion pictures, radio and TV.

“Present homosexuality, degeneracy and prom-
iscuity as normal, natural—in fact, hpalthy.

“infiltrate the cnurches.

“Soften the powers of arrest and treat all beha-‘i
vioral problems as psychiatric disorders.

“Dominate the psychiatric profession.
“Discredit the family as an institution.

“Emphasize the need to raise children away from

i the negative influence of parents.

“And create the impression that violence and in-
surrection are legitimate aspects of the American tra-
dition, that students and special interest groups
should rise up and use united force to solve economic,
political or social problems.”

These are only half of the Communist goals. as
listed by Skousen. '

Communist in the nude—-after all. it‘s in style
these days. ‘

The “Funny Girl" had success-

route (rut?). Her latest film
proves the point. In her first non-
singing part in the Ray Stark-Her-
bert Ross production of The Owl
and the Pussycat. one that was
proclaimed another test for the
award-winning actress, Strei-
sand is cast as ‘Doris, the pussy-
cat, the stereotyped dumb prosti-
tute who trys, unsuccessfully, to
convince herself that she is really
an actress and a model (by virtue
of a single television commercial
and an appearance in one so-call-
ed “adult movie”). '

George Segal is a bit more ad-
mirable in his slightly-less con-
ventional role of Felix. the owl. a
stuffy book store clerk with the
pretensions of an intellectual and
author.

After his performance in the
heavily-dramatic Who’s Afraid of
Virginia Woolf?——a performance
that subsequently won Segal an

Academy Award nomination for-

Best Supporting Actor. critics
were skeptical as to whether the
actor could perform well in corne-
dy.

Somehow, after wading through
all the drawbacks of the script,
Segal passes the test, although it
must be said that some of the por-
trayals are more than a little over
done, but at times can be blamed
on the absurdity of Buck Henry's
screenplay. '

One such scene finds Streisand
bursting int.o Segals apartment
after being evicted from her own
because Segal had informed the

I landlord that. he had seen her ac-

cept a pay off for her night time
activities. Streisand subsequently
develops a ridiculous case of the
hiccups and commissions Segal
to frighten her out of them. The

scene that follows one sees Segal
clandestinely donning a Hallo-
ween ghost costume in an effort
to accomplish his task. an absurd
situation and‘ completely out of
character for a supposedly intel-
lectual author.

SCREENPLAY ATTACKED
Looking at the movie as a

whole. most of the inadequacies
seem to fall under Buck Henrys
faulty screenplay. Henry was un-
wisely chosen to extract laughts
at the expense of two of the most
discriminated groups in our so-
ciety. prostitutes and homosex-
uals.

The ultimate insult that Strei-
sand as Doris could lay on the
self-proclaimed intellectual was
to incessantly condemn him as a
“faggot, a fruit, and a four-eyed
fairy.” It wasn’t much of a sur-

 

\

prise to hear the audience “cor-
rectly” respond to Henry’s one-

. liners. It was sad; it was disgust-

mg.

The scene only shoed me (and
some others. I hope) that Buck
Henry harbors as much immatur-
ity and prejudice (is not more)
as the myriad other writers who
insist on trodding on the already
socially condemned groups of
homosexuals and women.

Henry‘s portrayal of both
groups comes off as only another
manifestation of the decadent
and discriminatory standards that
our society‘ continues to erect and

support. I could only cringe when’

E I saw Doris wrestle with her own
status of a prostitute and repeat-
edly try to overcome her intellec-
tual inferiority to Felix by ex-
tracting 50 cent words from a die-
tionary to~use-in the presence of
the book store clerk in order to
impress him. -

Yet, Henrymade it evident that
Doris couldn’t even understand
half of what hewas saying at one
time. Felix was her -intellectual

superior while playing an inferior “

sexual role (they fall inlove, by
the way, negating his initial gay
status).

My conscience would never per-
mit me to condone The Owl and
the Pussycat, although Blood
Sweat and Tears did a good job
with the music. but for those in-
terested. the film is classic ex-
ample of society's (and especially
the film mediums) intentional op-
pression of these two minority
groups. I

with  £0! of Dctcrmina firm

” Theater (CAT) program. has its

growing pains.

“We can’t compete with the
Playhouse’s three stages,” he be-
gan. “But if we’ve survived one
and a half years, I am sure we
will be all right.”

"If we get a grant here and
there. and can build up a follow-
ing audience. it will help a great
deal. We are barely getting enough
money to pay off our bills. al-
though recently we received a
$500 grant from Levenson Steel
Foundation which is helping us.

Peters. a Duquesne graduate in
broadcast journalism. is now a’
graduate student at Carnegie-Met
Ion University in playwriting.
"Our theater does not intend to
rehash Broadway plays." he said.
"We are responsible to Pitts-
burghers who write plays and
cant get a place to produce them
until they are‘ established as
playwrights.

Peters also stressed perhaps
the theaters most important
function aside from the education-
al aspect. “We have a semi-social
work function. Some consider our
area "depressed" and it gives
people something to do. We are
community-oriented to the’ neigh-
borhood of Oakland. Our people
are non-professional. with no the-
ater background. They are also
non—college people.

“And, in a city -such as Pitts-
burgh, I think it is necessary to
develop a knowledge and love of
the theater.”

the theater entitled Forever

Freddy was rough in many spots. .-
and I .think the part.icipants,need- «

edua lot more raw (1 immer-

sion into what makes a play
smooth. It was obvious that sev-
eral of the actors were uncom-
fortable and stiff. I could tell that
they haven't learned to tune out
the audience yet, perhaps the
most basic thing an actor must
learn.

. They were also weaklin other
areas. Dialogue was sometimes
overacted.- or not spoken loudly
enough or clearly enough to hear
from the center of the room. The
whole last scene was completely
lost and from the action that went
on I am sure I missed the point of
the play, A

However,

keeping in (mind i I
the greenness of \
the persons in- ‘

volved,’ I think  .. I

that practice

 

will iron out
many of these
problems.

Much of the dialogue was also
directed upstage and away from
the audience; Perhaps they real-
ize that it is bad to turn their
faces completely from the au-
dience and haven‘t had enough
practice to make it automatic. I
do think. however. the director
and producer should emphasize
this point if he hasn’t done so.

As for Beverly Chan‘s play For- I

ever Freddy, I don’t think it was
really finished yet. Because of‘ill-
defined and vague characteriza-
tions. the meaning of her play
was not quite clear. It needs a lot
of unification. At times things
really did not seem to flow prop-
erly. and it took entirely too much
time to get into the action.

Perhaps the best aspect of, the

,thea.te,r was t.1.Ie..so1ind systefit

after. their.

was found to be distinct and clear.
My only suggestion in this matter
is to raise the speakers a bit high-
er, only a petty criticism.

It must be strongly emphasized
that this is a community theater
and must be judged solely on that
level. I also think that financial
problems are tying the hands of
those involved. V

For example. giants or funds
would give Juliet's family more
money to fix up the place and ini-
prove their lighting. Help from
the public in the area of props is
also necessary.

The price of admission is $1.25.

Some say that is too much to 1

charge for a theater that is pre-
sently raw and young. The reason
for this is that only about 20 peo-
ple ever attend the performances
and if more people came I think

. the price could be lowered.

Juliet‘s family also advertises

the fact that they need not only .

actors and writers. but techni-
cians. I might add that extra pro-
fessional_ help and direction would
be beneficial.

I think Juliet's family is worth-
while for survival and should be
given a chance. because what
they are accomplishing in the
area of community involvement is
an important project. But it must
be remembered that - they are
really just getting into the heart
of. things now. In a few years I
would imagine that a much better
community theater will emerge

Pitt Assistant Track Coach
Dennis Johnson is hoping there
will be a lot of people to cheer
at Pitts third annual Invitational
Track Classic tomorrow at the
Field House.

Pitts Invitational will host 9
college teams and will run
through the afternoon.

"Right now. the Invitational is
just a collegiate invitational. and
we will not have any AAU run-

.-ners."-‘ said Johnson when-asked

about the scope of the Classic.
Other meets. such as the one in
Philadelphia. include _out—of-col-
lege athletes. Such entrants could
be a possibility in the future.

Although no AAU athletes will

be there, there is plenty of tal-

ent -_coming from some of the
best Track schools in the East.

Kent State University (whom
Pitt defeated earlier in a dual
meet». West Virginia. The Naval
Acadamy and Ohio University
will provide the toughest compe-
tition for Pitt.

“I think we (Pitt) will have
the biggest names there”, re-
marked Johnson.

‘The biggest names‘ represent-
ing Pitt will be Jerr_v Ricliey.

that spell as he runs in the two-

The Millrose tiames is one of
the top meets in track. and the
whole Pitt coaching staff is de-
lighted that Richey will partici-

The invitation came after Rich-

Richey ran away from the com-

3 Panthers Drafted

 

Three Pitt football players were selected in the first day of the
National Football League collegiate draft yesterday. The three were de-
fensive backs.Charlie Hall and Bryant Salter and tailback Denny Ferris.

Hall's selection in the third round of the draft by the Green Bay
Packers again showed that an injury-riddled senior year didn‘t lessen
the scouts‘ opinion of the Panthers ability. He was named to two post-

season All-star games this year. and

yesterday he became the 63rd

Another defensive back. Bryant Salter. was the second Panther
selected by the pros when the San Diego Chargers tapped him on a fifth
round pick they had received via trade from Green Bay. Salter was
named to the UPI All-East team this year and is currently competing

in track at Pitt.

Denny Ferris, the third Panther chosen, was tapped by the Chicago
Bears in the seventh round. Ferris led the Jungle Cat gridders in rush-

ing and pass receiving in 1970.

ple their victory. All of his foul
shots came in the one-and-one
situation.

Up to that point it was any-
body’s ballgame. The contest sea-
sawed for almost its entire
length, with the largest margin
for either team being 6 points.
As the final score indicates,
both teams have to work hard for
their shots, using up valuable
time in the process.

The most consistent ballplayer
turned out to be the Owls‘ top
scorer Ollie Johnson. Johnson
scored 19 points. above his sea-
son‘s average of 12.3. and lead
both teams in the rebounding
department. with 11 big rebounds.

Mike Paul kept the Panthers
in the game as the final minutes
ticked away. Scoring 15 points to
lead the team. Paul began to
fill the void that the Pitt cagers
had created from the foul stripe
by converting key one-and-one
situations about midway through
the second half.

Pitt’s leading scorer Kent Scott
couldn’t find the range over
Temple’s tough zone. K.C. fin-

-Freshmen At Gymnasts Also Face

Owl Team In Philly

All of the Pitt varsity teams seem to be facing cross—state rival

Temple this week. and the gymnastics squad is no exception.

Coach Warren Neigers Pitt gymnasts will be meeting the Tem-

ple gym team in Philadelphia tomorrow in another difficult pairing.

The current Pitt record is 2-3. but it's Temple's past success that

indicates the strength of tomor-
row's opposition.

The Owls won the Eastern In-_
tercollegiate Gymnastics League
(EIGL) championship last year
and finished third in the NCAA
tournament. '

"Temple isa good team.“ Pitt
gymnast Dave Andrew admits.
“But they lost a couple of
their stars and during the past
season have been averaging in
the 1405. We've been averaging
scores in the 130's. so we will be
in the meet all the way."

Something that will help keep
the Pitt gymnasts in the meet is
the return of one of the squads
top performers. Lowell .\leek.

Meek was out of the gym line-
up in the squad’s latest loss at
Kent State because of a shoulder
injury. The gymnasts came up
with their lowest score of the
season in that defeat, a 115.98.

 
   
   
    
 

. .But .hostingTeinple last season 1

appeared to bring out the best in
the Pitt gymnasts as Neigers
squad scored one of its highest
totals of the year. despite losing
to the power.

Scoring as high as they did
against Temple last year <134.i3:3i
has become a more common oc-
currance this‘ year. though the
Pitt team continues to struggle
around the .500 mark.

A new wave of injuries has left the wrestling team’ with anoth-
er extensive casualty list. as the squad prepares to face Temple uni-
versity at home tomorrow night at 7:30 in the Field House.
~ Bob Kuhn tore rib cartilage in practice last Monday and aggra-
vated the injury at last Tuesdays match with Indiana iPa.i Univer-

sity. it

John Chatman also suffered a
back injuryaand reinjured l1_im—
self in the match with Michigan.

“They’re not serious injuries,”
said coach Dave Adams, “they’re
just aggravating, and they’ll
take time to heal.”

Both grapplers are in the ten-
ative line-up. but Adams hopes
he wont have to use them.

Mark Payne will again be ab-
sent from the line-up due to
"personal problems". according
to the coach.

Payne has wrestled in only
one match this year.

Ralph Cindrich will not re-
turn to the squad as expected due
to continued problems with his
injured knee.

Temple has escaped injury so
far. and they have compiled a
1-3 record. (The Owls wrestled
against American ‘University.
but the results were not availa-
ble at the time of this writing.)

Marksmen

1/At Home

"Weye been working hard this
past week on our scores." stated
Pitt rifle team co-captain Bruce
Barrett. The Pitt shooters will
have to do better tonight than
they did in last weeks lopsided
1302-.1214 loss to Duquesne.

Clarion is the major rifler op-
ponent tonight in a three-way
rifle match.- which also includes

jwinless Washington and Jeffer-

son. Clarion averages a 1250.
which is slightly better than the
Pitt squads 1243.

This if the _marksmen hope to
beat Clarion they will have to
shoot above their average to-
night. Washington and Jefferson
isn‘t expected to be a problem as
they have yet to win a match.
and their average is a very poor
1230. The Pitt shooters also de-

vfeated them earlier in the sea-

son. despite the fact that the
team shot well under their aver-
age at that time.

The Pitt riflers’ outlook was
brightened this week with the
addition of Wade Roberts, a
transfer student from the Brad-
ford campus who averages
around 250. As of now only Bill
Crooks and Bruce Barrett, the
team captains, shoot above 250
consistently.

Another "find" may be sopho-
more Tim Schmidt. who shot a
respectable 246 against Duquesne
in his only match. J

Kappa Sigma won their second intramural basketball contest
Wednesday night at Trees Hall by defeating Delta Sigma Chi. 47-

Kappa Sig trailed through most of the first half. With 14 min-
utes left in the first half Kappa Sig was down 14-12.

At the end of the half Delta Sig lead 27-21.

Going into the second half, Kappa Sig changed defenses and
possibly the outcome of the game. They were using a man-to-man
defense and changed to a 1-2-2 zone. Delta Sig was only able to

score 10 addition points against
Kappa Sig’s zone. The moving
