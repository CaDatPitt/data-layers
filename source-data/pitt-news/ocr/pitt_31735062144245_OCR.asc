Your resignation has been tendered to the Administration
and accepted. A

While there are some of us who are reluctant to see you
leave and were ready to back you next fall, there are also some,
as you well know, whose faces are countenanced with sly sneers
and “I told you so” grins.

Nevertheless, just as you are big enough to accept circum- _
stances here at Pitt, we are all big enough to wish you well in ‘

your new position.

Top ranking among student revival interests last semester
was the __in_tijoduction ‘of a move to reorganize the Pitt Panther,

the student monthly magazine. The move was iiistigatted largely"

by the literary minded who were impressed by the lack of such
a inagazine on the campus. These men and women foresaw an
outlet through which they might well beneﬁt in practical writ-
ing experience, therefore bending their energies to the reinstate-
ment. of a magazine curtailed in wartime by non-support and
non-participation. The reappearance of the Panther, long a
symbol of college spirit, will belong not only to the few
“literati” but ‘to the whole University, reﬂecting the attitude,
taste, and personality of Pitt. Hence there is logic in saying
that no one -can permit the Pantlier to be shouldered by a few.
It is the rospoiisibility of all.

The repujtation of the Paiitlier as a symbol of our Univer-
sity is known from coast to coast. VVe intend to form a monthly
magazine, entirely rejuvenated by our own efforts, called the
Pit1; Pantlier. The publication will represent you in a great
number of universities and colleges throughout the country with
whom we will exchange copies. You cannot afford to over-
look the possibilities such a wide range of interest involves.
With this opportunity to exploit the element of your own ex-
perience, is linked the development of a deep pride in your
school, and in knowing your cﬁ’:'orts were directed towards
fu1'thct'ing the creative spirit of the Uiiivcrsity. Your interest
will determine the ﬁnal result. Accepting any challenge is a
stiiiiiulaiit to American spirit.

'.l‘al<c this, Zthen,  an offer froin those before you who were
scepI_.i.ca.lJy hopeful. Those credited footsteps you will follow
and ﬁll with even higher credit.

The entliusiasm aroused this past semester over the Pitt
P«‘.llltliCl' may have disappeared in a fewand be only «faintly
siinincring in others, but the unknown few have never ceased
their labors even :to the few weeks preceding examinations.

Concluding the reminiscing is a question before the stu-

dent. “Is the Panther dead?” The answer is emphatically,
“No!” Anyone who suggested or harbored the thought was
1_iuconsciously falling short of his responsibility. The Panther
is purring; who will make him growl?

out of the elevators. But it’s nice,

University Adopts Plan
To Serve   More Vets

With thousands of ex-servicem

en prevented from taking advan-

tage of the educational provisions of the GI Bill of Rights because of
lack of space in colleges, the University last week announced the

adoption of ‘a plan whereby it"coul

The plan, which is believed to

It will go into effect at

the opening of the spring semester’
on February 11.

During the spring semester, the
University will offer two full time
programs each day. One session
will start at 3:30 and run until
9:30 o’clock for lectures. Some
laboratory classes will run until as
late as 11 o’clock. The ﬁfth hour,
ordinarily reserved as a lunch
hour will be used for classes.

Three credit lecture classes, for-
merly given three days a week in
three one hour class periods, will
be given twice a week in two-
hour-and-‘twenty minute periods.
Four credit lecture courses will be
offered twice each week in two
one-hour-and-forty minute classes.
, Lecture classes under the Pitt
Plan will be given on Mondays
and Thursdays or on Tuesdays and
Fridays. Wednesdays will be de-
voted to laboratories, drawing
classes, and to other programs
which require freedom from in-
t'erruption_. ’

Chancellor Fitzgerald explained
that although the new program
will be given in the late afternoons,
and evenings, it can by no means.

the ‘Pitt Plan the students" will be
able to do as much, work as during
the same number of months in‘t-he

were asked to call together. their

Lynn Thayer
Honored With
Legion of Merit

“For distinguishing himself by
exceptionally meritorious conduct
in the performance of outstand-
ing services,” Lynn W. Thayer,
assistant to the director of Uni-
versity extension courses, will be
awarded the Legion of Merit. The
former Captain Thayer will re-
ceive the rﬁtfth highesit award
given (by the Army forhis serv-
ices -at the Army Service Forces
Training Center, Camp Lee, Vir-
ginia, from February, 1941, to
October, 1945.

During his five years in the
Army, Mr. Thay-er was in charge
of training for‘ bands-men and
served as an advisor to the Ad-
jutant General, the Quartermas-
ter General, and the Surgeon Gen-
eral. ‘ .

"Before entering the*Army, Mr.
Thayer was associate directorof
the Louisville Symphony orches-
tra and was in charge of instru-
mental music at the Louisville
M-ale High school and of the Civic
Chorus of Louisville.

on coming -to Pitt, he was ap-
pointed executive secretary of the
Pennsylvania Forensic and Music
League. The League, which spon-
sors high school debates, speech,
and music contests en-ding in
statewide competitions each April,
has recently been reorganized.
More than 40,000 tak-e annual part
in the contested events.

New Courses

Offered  

With the peoples of the world
needing to understand each other
as never before, the University of
Pittsburgh is putting new stress
on communications, the conveying
of ideas in many ways.

Courses in writing, speech, mu-
sic, drama, the radio and many
other ﬁelds will be brought to-
gether in a broad Aprogram called
communications.

Already installed is the writing
major which is added to the long
established English major. It per-
mits the student to specialize in
an integrated program of compo-
sition—j0urnalism, ﬁction writing,
advertising, radio, verse and arti-
cle Writing.

Besides the technical skills
needed for these, the program was
planned in the belief that the suc-
cessful writer must have some-
thing to say and that he be as
widely informed as possible. For
this he will be directed into other
university courses. Moreover, he
will be addressed by widely known
writers.

Courses in speech are being ex-,
panded under the communication
program. Speech teachers on‘
leave of absence during the war
will return to their classrooms.
Buell B. Whitehill and Roy Umble
in speech correction and Dr. W.
George Crouch, debate coach, will
return during the spring semester.
Dr. Crouch will teach English to
technical students. Other speech
and voice courses will be given
by Misses Ruth R. Haun and Vir-
gin_i_a Cox.

A beginning class in radio script
writing will be’ given-in the even-
ing school during the spring term.
One begun in the fall will be.-con-A
tinued. Both will be instructed
by Mrs. Victoria Corey, radio ex-
ecutive.

,..-Two of the coeds get the high-pressure salesmanship for the Feb-
ruary Frolic from the businesjsimanager. Left to right they are: Laltue
Moss, Jeanne Mostollor, and Bill Zeﬁiro.

With Feb.

Monday, February 11, is more
than just the ﬁrs-t day‘ of school—-
it’s the day of the February
Frolic. -  " " ‘    .« .. 

By sponsoring the February
Frolic, a non-date afternoon tea
dance (no 'tea) on “the first day
of the new semester, Student
Congress is wasting no time in
getting the new: social season un-
der way. The event, the third in

a series of Student Congress spon-

sored afternoon dances, will be in
the Hotel Schenley from 3 until 6
o’clock. Tickets will cost 25 cents.

“Since we are only charging
25 cents, it’s easy to see that the
object of this dance is not to try
to make money. Student Congress
wantsﬂto have a nice friendly
dance with a college atmosphere.
We want to -get this new semester
off to a goo-d start,” said Bill Zei-
firo, ‘business ' manager of‘ ' the
Frolic.

The dance willvgive Pitt stu-
dents their first chance to dance
to_.the Hi-Hatters, a campus band.

Traditionally, it is composed en-
tirely of Pitt students. Before be-
the Hi-Hatters
played such places as the Trianon
in Toledo and the Aragon in
Cleveland.

Composed mostly of members of
the old band who left Pitt to go
into the armed services, the Hi-
Hatters is under the direction of
Miller Wuslich an-d features the
vocals of Sally Hyatt.

“We’re going to try to make the
Hi-Hatters a band with a college
atmosphere about it,” said Wus-
lich.

“Student Congress feels that a
dance of this sort can do a great
deal towards creati.ng a friendly
spirit among Pitt students. We
are sure the F-ebruary Frolic will
be ‘a social success,” said Vic Pul-
tanovich, chairman ofthe dance.

The size of the ballroom must
limit the number of tickets that
will be «put on sale. According to
Vic Pultanovich, only 1,000 tickets
will ‘be sold. Tickets will "be on
sale at the Student Congress booth
on the ground ﬂoor of the Cathed-
ral of Learning all during regis-
tration week and on Monday.

Observatory 
Discovers Star

One of a few such discoveries
in. the‘ history of “astronomy was
reported by Dr. Nicholas E. Wag-
man, acting director of the Alle-
gheny O=bservatory, before the
American Astronomical Society in
New York, last week.

Dr. Wagman told about his work
photographing certain bright stars
through an absorbing glass in or-
der to make the bright stars ap-
pear as faint as very distant stars
and to establish their relative dis-
tances.

In the course of such work,
Alpha Ophiuchi, ’bright star of the

constellation Ophiuchus was found

to be moving in an orbit indicat-
ing the presence of a “dark” com-
panion star.

Dr. Wagman’s discovery is un-
usual according to Dr. Stanton C‘.
Crawford, Dean of the College,
and chairman of the O«bse1'vatm-y
committee. He said,

“The Observatory committee is
proud to note that this particular
piece of research has brought
fruitful results. rom my in-
quiries I abeliev-e that only a few
such discoveries have been made
previously. The first such dis-
covery was that of the compan-
ions df Sirius and Procyon in
1844.” »

Advice To  _ _    
Thatls    . .  1

With the advent of each sem-
ester, new fresh-men of the male
variety invariably ﬁnd tough go-
ing in ‘breaking the ice with the
vast majority of Pitt coeds. Of
course, there are always a few
femmes who live their lives in an
eager fashion and enjoy corralling
hapless neophytes in booths, cub-
by-holes, and «what-have-you, but
they represent a dwindling mi-
nority left over from the lean
hungry war years. Therefore, as
an aid to incoming frosh, who are
slightly bewildered by the awe-
some -complexity of it all, we
offer the 'following bits of data on
“How To Flirt Fluen-tly,” or “Iiife
In The Tuck Shop Made Easy.”

First of all, as you enter the
Tuck Shop act perfectly natural.
You may cough and sputter a
little the first few times, but after
a while you’ll discover that you
can actually breathe the smoke
and that you hardly miss your
usual quota of oxygen at all. After
you have mastered the entrance,
there are various ways of winning
the lady of your choice. Y~ou,mi~ght
visit a hock shop, before hand,
and then sidle by with a gleam-
ing fraternity pin on your chest;

or you -may adopt more subtle .

measures such as buying two or
three cartons of cigarettes and
skipping -gaily from booth to
booth {with a philanthropic air
as you deposit packs in outstretch-
ed feminine «hands.

Finally, when you have gained
a seat beside your intended, regale
her with a [few tactfully expressed
compliments. For instance, you
might tell her how completely un-
scholarly she looks, or mention
the unusual contrast in colors be-
tween h-er orange skirt and pur-
ple nail polish. A few small favors
are always .-effective too such as

buying her lunch, presenting her
with two tickets to next weeltfs
show at the Nixon, or p_u1jcha’sjing'
the seven books of raffle tiqketsf
she just happ_ens=to have onjhandf
If after all this you _are s_ti_ll
spurned, then, youlhave a per-
fect right toplbe disgusted. As a
parting ges-ture, however, buygheri
one of those nice squishy "Tuck:
Shop salads. Then, as she smirl<_sj'
up at’you condescendinaly. -pu.s.h
the "salad into the origin _.of ;th_e
smirk, namely her face. A gppo-i
menﬂs Cf0n.tiinu€"d Dllﬁhillg 
with a sAli__ght7circular

much more i;rnpr_e__ssive. :.(_Q_,f ‘c_q.ur,s‘e,"
you’re really doing her a favor.
since that creamy gooey _s,tuﬁ.’Tis'
said to be good for the ,pQIj_QS.) ‘
‘Next, with your little __ta_sk ex-
ecuted and your If.e_1l'0w s\tu_d_e_nj_;s;
duefully impressed, stride _out of:

Although ‘there was little ac-

the semester vacation which was
mourned rather than welcomed
-by Pitt fraternity men (they had
to be without their pins for two
weeks in a row) a little gossip
was still gathered.

The.I'.iK-As ended their semester
with their annual “Hard Times”
dance. Over the vacation many
PiK-As jtraveled to Penn State
where they stayed at their broth-
er chapter house after the basket-
ball game. The Pi Lams also sent
some of their members to witness
-the Pitt «defeat at Penn State.

There is another member in the

We join them in welcoming Jim
Pullman back ,-from the signal’

night to welcome "home their vets.
The Phi Eps are also making prep-
arations ‘for a formal dinner dance
-to be held next month. some new-
ly initiated Phi Eps will be there"
to help «them celebrate. They are:

Kellogg Grants
$60,000 Fund

For Nursing

A grant of $60,000 from the
W. K. Kellogg Foundation, Battle
Creek, Michigan, has been receiv-
ed «by the School of Nursing. It
will furnish funds to help sup-
port three major projects: devel-
oping industrial nursing, training
supervisors in psychiatric nursing,
and providing a workshop in nurs-
ing education.

All three measures are timely
and most appropriate in this 10-
cality according to Dr. Ruth Per-

kins Kuehn, dean of the school-

Dr. Kuehn further stated, “Pitts-
burgh is geographically located as
an ideal center to develop indus-
trial nursing. Here are all types
of industry from the heaviest to
the lightest.”

Explaining the need of nurses
for mental patients, Dr. Kuehn
said, “The Veterans administra-
tion is recruiting 800 psychiatric
nurses. Thestate of Pennsylvania
is also seekingitrained women for
our state mental institutions. These
are only to meet the immediate
needs of the veterans in the hos-
pitals.”

The workshop is a demonstra-
tion of a new technique in con-
tinuing education in nursing «for
around-the-year service for ‘on-
the-joib workers.

Dr. Kuehn feels that the grant
is -a ﬁne tribute to the school
which has the fullest accrediting
as a member of the three fore-
most nursing associations.

Pitt:-Tries For No. 7..al: Tech Gym

Facing a tip-off for the tenth time this season, Doc Carlson’s current rendition of the ‘Panther bask-
etball team seeks its seventh victory tonight against neighboring Carnegie Tech on the Tartan ﬂoor.

Thus far this season, Pitt has won six and lost three.

Wins were recorded against Westminster,

Tech, Penn State, Bethany and Geneva twice. Ohio State and Penn State are responsible for the

Panther losses, with the Buckeyes‘?

winning two and the Nittany Lions,
one. ‘

In the previous game, the Tar-
tans were no match for the Panth-
ers, as Pitt scored a 56-45 victory
despite Gene Hannum, son of the
former Tech coach Max Hannum,
who hooped 18 points for Tech.

Other Tech ﬂoormen who will
bear watching by Panther guards
are ‘Duzma and Butler, who have
been running liot and cold all sea-
son. Lastisaturday they scored
16 and 14 points respectively in
losing to J uniata.

Penn State Wins

The past week proved disastrous
to the Jungle Cats as they twice
fell victim, once to Penn State and
Ohio State. _

Paced by dimitive Milt Simon,
Nittany Lion forward, the Penn
State cagers toppled a favorite
Panther ﬁve last Saturday, by the
score of 48-37 on the Lion ﬂoor to
even the series.

Simon, a former sailor, found
little trouble in needling his way
through the Pitt defense to chalk
up 17 points on seven ﬁeld goals

and three foul shots. Only Hank
Zeller kept the locals in the run-
ning as he garnered.15. markers on
four ﬁeld goals and seven free

throws.

Pitt was outclassed during the
entire game, and only in occasions
did they show the type of ball
that won six consecutive games
earlier this season. The Lions
jumped off to a 9-1 lead in the
ﬁrst six minutes and were never
headed. The half time score was
28-21.

In the fourth period, Pitt pulled
within six points of the Lions, but
two goals each by Johnny Rusinko
and Wally Hatkevich quickly iced
the game.

Pitt’s accuracy at the foul line
kept the game from being a rout,
as the local cagers completed 13
of 15 free throws.

Earlier this season, the Jungle
Cats defeated the State Collegers
by a 45-38 count, with Hank Zeller
again accounting for 15 points.
Pitt Loses to 0.S.U.

Once again the Ohio State ﬁve
proved more than a match for Doc

  
  

Carlson’s hoopesters as they in-
ﬂicted a .43—33 defeat on the
Panthers‘ last Wednesday at the
Stadium.

As per usual, the Pitt quintet
spotted its opponent a command-
ing lead and attempted a Frank
Meriwellﬁnish, but the Buckeyes
were never to be headed.

Jack Underman, six foot six
freshman center, was the deter-
mining factor in the game as he
tied up Hank Zeller very effective-
ly and managed to score 10 points
himself to lead the Ohio team’s
scoring.

Leading point-maker in the
game was Pitt’s pint—sized Nate
Apple who hit the mesh for 11
markers, however this along was
not enough to couple with Ohio
State’s advantage in the hight de-
partment.

This was the second loss of the
season to the Buckeyes, as they
captured an earlier game by a
47-37 margin. Last week’s game
halted a Panther win streak of six
games.

Trailing throughout the entire game, Carlson’s unpredictable

ballgame did Pitt exhibit anything which would brand them as a first
class team. Instead of playing basketball, they put on a one act play

A new basketball rule states
that any player leaving the game
in the last four minutes of play is
unable to enter again. When ,.Con-
sentino left the game on‘ fouls,
Williams, his substitute, was de-
nied entrance because of his in-
eligibility” under the four minute
rule. “He promptly blurted forth
to the scorekeeper “I’m not in-
eligible, I passed all my subjects.”

The radio announcer talked,
laughed, roared, and commented
that this was the best show of the
year.

The frolic ended in Room 4 of
the Nittany Lion Hotel where the
boys promised to beat Tech.

Pick it up . . . in your bare hands . ; . any-
thing made of aluminum. Your cigarette
box. A saucepan. The foil on a choco-
late bar.

You’re not touching aluminum. You
never have, never will. _

The reason is very simple. Aluminum is
constantly covered with the thinnest of
thin “skinsi’. It is Aluminum Oxide. You

can scrape‘ it off, but it re-forms immedi-

ately. In a split second.

This—-the scientists at Alcoa’s Alumi-
num Research Laboratories learned many
years ago . . . but they didn’t stop there.
They wantedlto know what could be done
to this “skin” . . . how it could be made

‘ thicker, thinner, harder, porous . . . so that

Aluminum products could be more useful
-and serviceable.
Out of this Alcoa research on the “skin”

Mil"!

, of aluminum have come many new things.

Aluminum pistons of porous “skin”, to
hold oil. Aluminum trays of lush lustre
that won’t tarnish———ever. Colored alumi-
num—-—the color dyed right into the “skin”.

Yes, Alcoa has found many ways of not
only controlling this “skin” but also of
making aluminum better and more versa-
tile in many, many ways . . . but the search
still goes on and always will. ‘

This search calls to young men of science
and engineering . . . and spells new oppor-
tunity to salesminded men of tomorrow.

The next time you pick up . . . in your
bare hands . . . anything made of aluminum,
say to yourself, “What new could I make
this light, strong, durable metal do for
man . . . some day?”

The big question who will be
the University of Pittsburg:h’s 1946
football coach is still unsettled,
but one name can now be crossed
from the list, that is Clark D.
Shaughnessy. ’

Clark Shaughnessy stepped in-
to Chancellor Fitzgerald’s ofﬁce
on Monday afternoon and handed
in his resignation to which end-
ed'his three year war time reign
at Pitt. T‘

The Next Coach To Be?

Before Christmas vacation a
questionnaire, was given to the
football players asking them to
give their personal ‘opinion on
seven stated questions. Question
2 is as \follows—-Is: the coaching
staff practical? If so, what do you
base your opinion on and if not,
why :isn’t it?—-How can it be im-
proved?——What is your opinion
of ‘Mr. iS~haughnessy’s coaching?——
Could. anyone have done better?

‘ At least a half of the answers
to the last part of the ques-
tion stated Doc Hartwig was
the man that could have done bet-
ter. Now that hats are bei.ng toss-
ed in to the ring, why not give
Doc a chance? The boys like him
and will put out all the way for
the former Pitt All-American.
The Faculty Athletic committee
saw the questionnaires and know
the ball players are for Doc. When
it was rumored that Shag was on
his way. out some papers brought
up the name Eddie Baker, a for-
mer quarterbac-k und-er Jock
Sutherland. The football players
d'idin’t think to much of him. The
next two weeks should bring an
announcement of the next coa-ch-
to-be.

Resignations Off

The resignations handed in by
Hoel, Hartwig and Olenn are now
void since Clark Shaughnessy re-
signed. Their resignations were
to stand‘ only if Shag remaine-d.
It remains to be seen whether or
not the coach ‘to be Will retain

these men. If Doc gets the jobuthe
staff will stay intact and prob-
ably add a backﬁeld coach. The
policy followed by the University
is the coach picks his own assist-

ants, but they must be acceptable
to. the Faculty Athletic Committee.
A.Cl1ange Likely

After sticking to the same line-
up through the whole season Dr.
Carlson expects to change it to-
night. In place of Medich at
starting guard, in all probability
Pat Malarkey will be there.
Other starters are Apple, Zeller,
Marazeuski, and Consentino, Sam-
ym David, Pitt life saver, failed to
appear for the State game: Why
it’s still a mystery.
Our Deepest Sympathy

The Pitt News rwishes to ex-
tend its deepest regrets to Dr. H.
Carlson and family upon the re-
cent death of Mrs. Carlson. Mrs.
Carlson died on the eve of the
Pitt-Geneva game. Doctor Carlson
wasn’t on the bench that game but
his boys didn’t forget him.

Second in Jump

With Henbie Douglas placing

highly successful season. Douglas
with a jump of Zlvfeet and 8
inches placed second only to the
brilliant Max Minor_of Army who
not only won the running broad-
jump, but also the 100 yard dash
and the low hurdles.

In the 100- yard. dash an argu-

For music the students use
either the piano or a vic and they

instructor of this unique course,
says the important thing is that
the class learns to call dances as
well as do them.

Program Offered

In addition to the regular ma-
jor in English, the English de-
partment is offering a special ma-
jor in writing. It is an integrated
program of courses in composi-
tion, including journalism, ﬁction
writing, advertising, radio, verse,
and article writing. Its purpose is
to train students to take a-dvan-
tage of the opportunities in writ-
ing open to young men and
women.

The course is planned on the
basis of not only the skills and
techniques which a writer must
have, but also the many ﬁelds of
human interest he must know. The
student will be directed by spe-
cial advisers in studies of liter-
ature and in courses given by
other departments.

Throughout the course, distin-
guished authors will visit the
campus to assist in the training
of writing majors.

Applications for positions on
the Owl advertising staff will
now be received from qualiﬁed
students. Those interested. con-

purchasing agent for Pitt since
then, was -namiedhsecretary De-
cember 1 on at full time basis.

program for the Association and
its members, graduate or non-

consists of -men: and wo-menfwho
have had some c_o;ll,ege training, at

complete their courses for a de-
gree. He stated, “These plans will
include -all veterans. After their
