many students are lost in the
schufﬁe when making the jump

from high school into a large
university. “He said regionals
should help ease many of. the
difficulties incurred in this
transformation.

‘.‘Society’s pace is increas-
ing and the student is faced
with a much more competi-
tive academic environ-
ment than, let’s say, ten years
ago when I was going to col-
lege,” he said. .

According to Rose, explora-
tory talks with citizens of the
then‘ proposed regional areas

were begun -in the early part.

of 1962. A formalized feasibility
study was undertaken in June
and July of ’62 to determine
socio—economic values of those

potential students, their par-
ents and civic leaders ofthose
particular areas.
Questionnairs Distributed
Questionnaires were ‘distrib-
uted to high school students,

' to -. administrators and guidance.

counselors, and to parents. A
resume of comments in Greens-
burg and‘ Bradford revealed.

,— Greensburg: Many par- 4

ents felt they could not af-
ford the cost atrthe Oak-I.
land Campus, yet desired a
quality education for their
children. Several parents
noted the cost of attending
the University _is ‘now too
high and questioned whether
community college (under the
University) would be of any
relief. Mention was made that
a community college would
aid the student who is work-
ing his way thrgugh in al-

’ of study,”.

 

he  D/[€€tS

lowing h im to retain his
summer and/ or p a r t-time

Bradford: A community

college would give Bradford a‘

needed cultural inﬂuence. This
influence would not only re-
ﬂeet in higher standards in high
schools, but would aid in the
establishment of a higher
standard of values for the com-
munity.
Differences Found

“Certain measurable differ-
ences were found in the areas
Rose said, “but it
was the not—so—tangible evi-
dances of a desirable atmos-
phere that we spent a great
deal of time on.” , .

He explained that ‘,‘Johns-

town College was used as a ’

measuring stick.” It was de-
cided a 20-mile radius would
be established ‘for each re-
gional, marking off a reason-

,able standard from which to

draw student ' clientele.’ \

Presidents were officially ap--

pointed "to run‘ the affairs of
the regionals ‘in. February. They
are: Dr. Donald Swarts, Brad-

‘ ford; Dr. Albert Smith, Grens-
burg, and Dr. Joe Ball, Titus-

ville. , .
Two-Fold Task
Regional presidents had a
two-fold task: (1) of recruit-
ing a‘ faculty, and (2) of re-
cruiting a freshman clas. ‘
Each regional has- been
-supplied with a faculty, the
largest single segment re-
from the Oakland campus,
according to Rose. A break-
down of students shows:

An Obligation‘

Bradford’s total of part-time
students does not include eve-
ning classes. A

Not Soon Enouglr

“We didn’t get started with
the enrollment process soon
enough,” Rose said. “Titus-
ville and Greensburg totals
were disappointing.” ‘

However, he was quick to
pointeout that Bradford’s to-
tal was a pleasant surprise.
He explained that out-of-
state students helped boost
.Bradford’s total. Each re-
_gional can accommodate 500
to 600 students reasonably
well with present facilities,
according to Rose. y

“Support in the fund—rais-
ing campaigns ‘held in these
areas was remarkable,” he
noted. '

§5“i%iAims Of Regional Program Announced

New Campuses To Help Fulfill

,Educational Needs In Penna.

The new regional campuses at Greens-burg, Titusville, and Bradford represent the

University’s attempts to fulﬁll the educational needs of western Pennsylvania. To provide

A additional college facilities, especially for freshmen and sophomores, to counteract the
enrollment boom, to meet rising college costs—these are the aims of the Univ.ersity’s

I

‘ freshman and

expansion program.

_ It all began when a Regional Programs Division was established under Vice
Chancellor John Geise; soon after, in December, 1961, area communities requested the

 University to make studies as to the feasibility of instituting a branch campus there.‘

Such factors as population, existence of local competing colleges, and the type of

education needed, w h e t h e r .

technical or academic, deter-

mines, the selection of a site for

a regional campus. Also con-
sidered. were ec,ono‘micﬂcondi-
tions, percentage of local high
school graduates who go on to

I college, and the opinions of

principals and counselors. On
this basis Connellsville, Frank-
lin, Ridgeway and Kittanning
were surveyed .and turned
down.

‘At Least 250 Needed

Apibranch campus must be
capable of enrolling a potential

of 250 students at ‘the beginning]
‘ “of the third year to expect to

make itself self-supporting. The
community in which the re.-
gional campus is located will
foot the bill for the _ﬁrst__ two
years, so the UniVersity’s main
expense is the cost of the feasi-
bility studies and the services it
willprovide as the main cam-
pus. ‘
For this comparatively
modest investment, the Uni-
versity should make many
gains or incur few glosses.
“Since colleges lose a good
number of students in their
sophomore
-y.ears, the two-year branches
can ﬁll ‘up the empty spaces

, in the main campus enroll-

.-ment. Lower branch tuition’
‘-rates may also channel stu-
. dents seeking a ‘less expensive

education from a state college

versity to the University

$28 a‘ credit with no university
fee, ascompared with the main

tuition is

, campus tuition of $33 a credit

plus a university fee of $6 a
creditgfor the ﬁrst 12 .credits
each trimester.

Regional tuition is lower be-
cause, according to Chancellor
Edward H. Litchﬁeld, “the
course offerings, though high in
quality, will be fewer in num-

ber.” eAt the older and larger‘

Johnstown branch, tuition is $30
a credit because a greater num-
ber of courses _are. offered- A

can attend the regional campus
for about $900 a year tuition
and $100 for books and supplies.

pOut-of-state students must pay

an.-—extra $220 for two trimesters.
More Teaching Than Research
Other advantages to regional
campus students include a
greater emphasis on teaching
than research by faculty mem-
bers, _the intimacy of a small
campus,
greater attention and supervi-
sion from a professor, since the
ratio of students to teachers
will be low for a while.
Disadvantages lie in the
knowledge that outstanding
professors will be‘ concen-
trated at the main campus,
where a higher percentage of
top students will probably be
found due partly -to the
abundance of full scholar-
ships. However, the branch
campuses will give the mar-
ginal students a needed
chance and enable him to en-
roll as a junior at the Oak-
land campus or some other
four year college.

Deans from thepmain campus
will work out curriculum with
locallcollege officials. Since the
programs offered, liberal arts,
education, and engineering, are
run on a trimester basis, stu-

_dents may complete two years

of study in 16 months.

Local teachers and business-
men may elect to take night
classes to earn graduate credits.
Night programs to provide tech-
nical training‘ and retraining for
local industry may; be set up.
The branches also hope to offer
non-credit courses in subjects
of special interest to local peo-
ple. '

The branch campuses may
expand into the area of provid-
ing housing for - students. One

out of six Johnstown students .

rent a room in town. At Brad-_
ford a full-scale. dining room
will_ be in operation, and at
Greensburg a dormitory may be
built. .
Just the Beginning
The addition of the three new

campuses to the University
family isvnot an end; it is a be-

and opportunity for

ginning. Feasibility studies are
being conducted in Butler, Can-
nonsburg ,and the Beaver Val-
ley,. possibly ear-marked. for
opening branch campuses in
1965.

Greensburg, Bra-ford

Titusville may develop and
stay within the University
family as Johnstown ‘has for
thepast 35 years. Or, after a
number of years, they" may
decide to become independ-
ent. Or, the University may
supply educational service, ‘or
contract to the "independent
college under the new state
community college law.

This could lead to its evolu-
tion into a terminal technical
school. With this status, if 70
per cent of its courses are tech-
nical, instead of Liberal Arts,
the community college could
receive one-third of its operat-
ing expenses from the‘ state.

Each of the three presidents of the new regional campuses has at
one time or another in the recent past stressed the obligation of
the University to further the cause of higher education in Western

Pennsylvania.

And as Chancellor Litchﬁeld himself has stated: “the provision
of ample college facilities to meet the educational needs of our so-
ciety in the next decade is a challenge and a responsibility which

cannot be avoided.”

The University has met this challenge and has accepted this re-
sponsibilityby the establishing of the colleges at Greensburg, Titus-
ville, and Bradford, and is planning to further this cause by setting
up more regional schools as soon as the sites have been selected.

This has been the University’s part of the bargain —— a willingness
to spread its educational resources over the entire western part of
‘the state —— but it has not been the only contribution.

Just as dramatic-and a great tribute to the cities where the

Two-Year Program
Students completing a two-

» - Titusville, whose only
- claim to fame in the ‘past
 has been the famous Drake
well, the ﬁrst producing oil
—_ rig in the United States, has
I now added a second attrac-
 tion in the form of the Titus-
j§‘.v-ille extension of the ‘Univer-
 “ sity’s regional‘ campus program.
. .The city in which the new
. campus has been established
 was once the center of a thriv-

 ing oil reﬁning district, but the

gitusvil

~  be-*1. -3

town has suffered losses in in-
dustry in the past few years
which has greatly cut into the
ﬁnancial resources of the com-
munity.

Despite this situation, the
people of Titusville have been
able to contribute some $430,000
toward the establishment of this
new branch campus. ’

Buildingfs Donated

In addition‘ to- this sum, the

University received the gift of

buildings and grounds from

 

. " . ALMOST ALL classes at Titusville will be held in the re-decorated‘

. 25 room McKinney mansion and an adjacent carriage house.

 

 

Mrs. Charlotte Haskell and the
Titusville Women’s Club. The
estimated value of the property
which they contributed exceeds
$150,000.

The fund campaign and the
campaign to establish the
campus was a total commun-
ity effort. In one instance, 168
members _of. the Titusville
Area School District contrib-
uted $25,000 to the Univer-
sity, and another ‘time, a
third grade class of a Titus-
ville elementary school con-
tributed their recreation fund
to “Pitt’ instead of using it
for "ice cream.

“One remarkable acheivement
.of the campaign,” remarked Dr.
Joseph M. Ball, president of the
Titusville campus, “was that the
cost of the fund campaign was
less I than one per cent of the
total dollar amount donated.

Applaud Support
“We applaud the community
of Titusville for its whole-
hearted acceptance and support

c.-v

4 

of the University of Pittsburgh
at Titusville.”

Like the other new region-
als, the Titusville Campus,
will provide a cross-section of

the total educational program A

of the Oakland campus.

It will offer a program in the
ﬁrst two years of the under-
graduate ﬁelds of ~liberal arts
and engineering, and will also
offer _ graduate studies for a
master's degree in education,

business, and other professional .

ﬁelds.
Evening Program

The college will also conduct
a part-time evening program
for adults which, according to
Robert" C. Newell, executive
secretary of the Titusville
Chamber of Commerce and
chairman of the campus’ ad-
visory committee, will encour-
age recovery in Titusville be-
cause industry likes to move
into a town with a college

"where their employes can take

working together rather than a
group that already knows each
other’s thoughts and feelings
because they’ have been closely
associated for many years.

When you have the ﬁrst
group and put it with some

then you will have a real aca-

good. I

Further, a student in a small

life.

Modest Enrollment

According to
released by Ball, the campus
has “52 full time students and
49 evening st.udents; and while
this enrollment is modest, it
does have its advantages in per-

recent ﬁgures -

mitting a close interaction be-
tween instructors and students.
It makes for ideal conditions
under which to initiate college
study; for the faculty as well as
for the students.”

One problem which may
cause some ditﬁculties in ac-
quiring additional students in
the future is the close prox-

  New Regional Campus

.9 Program Saves Costs

‘:1.

University officials feel that
«regional campuses located in or
near a community will not only
:-‘enable the University to edu-
gcate a larger number of stu-
dents without major new ex-

vpansion of the Oakland cam-

pus, but it will also save par-
ents the cost of boarding their
children away fromhome.

 Since the course offerings .at
the regionals will be fewer in
number than ‘those available
at the main campus, the tui-
"tion will be lower. Each of the
regional campuses will be self-
supporting from tuitionlonce a

building ' and equipment have
been provided.

,All programs offered at
the new ‘campuses ~will be
offered on the trimester cal-
endar. Students, therefore,
may complete the two year
program in’ one and one-'
third years.

The criteria for selecting the-

regional campus sites included
the area’s need and its ability
to provide facilities. and a stu-

_dent enrollment of at least 250

within two years.‘ The second

requirement was necessary in.

order to assure the jregionals’
self-sufﬁciency.

imity of a large number of
established small colleges,
which makes it tough for a
new school to become an im-
mediate success.

For example, only a dozen
miles from Titusville is .the Oil
City extension of Clarion State
College — a thriving two-year
regional campus whose tuition
is about one-third as high as
that at the University’s center.

Reflected Fact

This fact is reﬂected in the I

enrollment which is only half
of that predicted earlier in the
year by Dr. John Geise, the
University’s vice chancellor for
regional programs.

Dr. Ball, however, has great
faith in the people of Titusville
and considers their support “al-

most staggering.”

 Texan Again Sees Oil Wells

 

Dr. Joseph M. Ball, already
long familiar with oil wells
from his childhood
is the president of the new re-

in Texas,

gional campus at Titusville, a
center of the oil producing dis-
trict of northwestern Pennsyl-

vania.

Dr. Ball, a native of El Paso,
received his sheepskin from the
University of Texas and an ad-
dition from the University of
Southern California. He has
been a member of the Pitts-

burgh faculty since 1948, where"

he taught in the areas of phoe-
netics, public address, and
speech pathology.

In the summer of 1952, he
held a chair as a visiting prof-

fessor at Whittier College in‘

California.

Association Member

He is a member of thegspeech
Association» of America and the

American Speech, and hearingg

Association, ’ from which he

 

holds advanced certiﬁcation in
speech pathology.

Ball agreed to accept the
Titusville presidency on the
one condition that the stand-
ards. of the regional campus
would be on a par with those
of the parent school in Oak-
land.

The faculty which he brought
to Titusville with him for the
beginning of the ﬁrst term is a

very young one — in keeping

with the newness of the school.
There is no teacher as old as
Ball, and he is only 43.

“I wanted young teachers,"
he said, “My teachers will be

judged on how well they teach,:

not on whether they publish in
the scholarly journals.”

His __full time faculty of nine
includes“ no person with less
than a masters degree and all

are working toward their doc-
torates.
