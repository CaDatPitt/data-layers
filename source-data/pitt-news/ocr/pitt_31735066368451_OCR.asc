‘By VALERIE KAY

Where do students seek help to
find a babysitter for their children
while they‘re in classes? This is a
good question for students like Abi
Revera, who has been looking for a

‘babysitter since January for her
four-month old baby girl.

There are private babysitting ser- ~

vices in-the area, but the waiting lists
are very long. Revera has been on a
waiting list since January but proba-
bly won't receive the service until
September at the earliest.

“Carnegie-Mellon has a babysit-
ting service for infants, and I just

I» ',don’t understand why Pitt can't do

the same,” Revera said. The Campus
Nursery Center, adjacent to the F alk
School, has a babysitting service for
pre-school children. However, these
services are for children who are
three and four years old. The
nursery’s program, in which approx-

imately 30 students are enrolled,-,

runs from September to August.

The nursery’s purpose is two-fold.
It’s a design program for pre-
schoolers that emphasizes the social-
ization process. Its programs
involve sharing and similar activities

which instill self confidence in pre-
; fschoolers. ‘

The nursery’s other purpose is to
serve as a training model for student
teachers working on their master’s
degrees. * . 4

The nursery is availableito both
Pitt students and faculty, but it does

not take care of" children beyond or

”under,t_he ag'es'of.,three—and V‘ ‘

“We are licensed by the Depart-
ment of Public Welfare and the
Department of Education,” Dr. Bar-
bara Murphy of the Campus
Nursery Center said. She explained
that in order to be licensed, the
Department of Public Welfare must

our, '

come to theiproposed facility and
actually measure’ the amount of

"space available for each child.

“They require a certain amount of
space for each student, and our facil-
ity is permitted to hold 30," she said.

The program was started 13 years
ago, and three and four year old pre-
schoolers were enrolled. The
nursery’s facilities didn't permit
expansion so it chose to continue
with students of that age.

After seeking assistance with the

(Campus Nursery Center, Revera

tried the student employment office.
Again the services were not
available. ‘

Julia Laird of the Student
Employment Office said “the baby-

sitting services were available atone

3..-r, t.\..s.,..» . .. ‘-s . ; ._.~—.-.

,,~

‘Pitt Students Need Babysitting

time but we’re discontinued 'for a
number of reasons.”

Laird said that a lot of problems
arose with the service. Laird gave the
example of students who were com-
mitted to work but would not show
up or would cancel at the last
minute. _

“The parentsfwould then call the
employment office and request a
replacement, which was difficult to

.— do at the last minute,” she said.

“There were also problems with
parents who did not return home at
their designated times. If the
student-sitter had a class to attend,
they were confronted with the choice
of either missing their class or leav-
ing the child unattended.

‘‘It just beca-me quite a hassle,”
Laird said. “Parents would also
request character references which
the University was unable to give.”

When presented with the possibil-
ity of the employment office becom-
ing a liasion between interested
students J seeking employment and
interested parents looking for baby-
sitters, Laird said that it “might be a
possibility.”

Students could submit their
names to the office and parents
could get in touch with them outside
of the Employment Office, but this
would be a situation that would first
have to be discussed and approved
by the director of the Employment
Office, she said. ,1,

A similar program used to be
available at the-School of Nursing.
The service was run by two students
who have since graduated. They
attempted to sell their business to
other students, but none showed
interest‘, and the service‘ was

g discontinued.

Unionizing Attempt 

By» MARK A. SINDLER

Since it was revealed that two
University Book Center employees
were fired and three others sus-
pended in early January for what
many believe is a Pitt attempt to
thwart union representation, three
employee meetings have taken place
with representatives from the
Allegheny Joint Regional Board.

. .‘ The board is attempting to get the I

bookstore recognized by Pitt as part
‘of Local l0l ‘of the Retail Wholesale
Department Store Union. At the last
meeting, Feb. 4, representative Tom
Scheid said that it was called to give
all interested employees details
about what is involved with unions
and what unions can do for its
members. ‘

“It was mostly an informative
meeting,” Scheid said. Matters such
as the union security clause and the
implications of the Pennsylvania
Labor Relations Act were discussed.

“Actually, we had a very short
speech at this particular meeting,
and we really went into ‘a question
and answer session which answered
alot of the questions,” he said.

This latest meeting was held at a
hotel in Oakland, Scheid said. It

lasted for a little over two hours and
gave the employees, most of whom
had never before been in a union,
details of what is involved in being a
member of a union. One of those
employees, Victor Scuillo, said all
three meetings’ have been
informative. I —

“The purpose of the meetings is to_
find out what the union can do for

us." he said. “The question and "U 
answer sessions dealt with what we _
can and cannot put into a contract, e

such as.bi-weekly pay and a positive
grievance procedure, which the uni-
versity does not have.”

Most of the people involved in
these meetings, Scheid explained,
wanted to know what_ they can

expect to -achieve with union repre- “

senttation. There are things, he said,
that no organization can achieve
(unless there’s~:a union), including
the tripling of the wage rate.

“We were telling the folks that
once they get representation,"
Scheid said, “it’s certainly not going
to be a utopia at the bookstore.
There's still a lotiof work to do.
Actually, organizing a union is only
the first step; the real work begins
with the negotiating of the first con-
tract and subsequent contracts.

“They were curious, and rightfully
so, as to how the contract would be

While academics are impor-
tant, many students find that
straight academics leave some-
thing lacking. Many wish to
incorporate international studies
into their educations, and that
takes planning. ~ ‘

“It does cost more, and stu-
dents should expect that,” said
Annagene Yucas, from the office
of the director of the University
Center of International Studies
(UCIS). “You need the time to
arrange for savings and flexibil-
ity in your schedule, so it’s not
too late even for incoming fresh-
men to apply.”

There are ways to cut costs,
however. Scholarships are
available through the National-
ity Rooms program office and
the Institution for European Stu-
dies as well as Semester at Sea
augmentation grants, Yucas
said. . » i

\

Funding Available For
In ternational Studies

Nationality Room scholar-
ships selections are currently
being made, Yucas said, and the
winners receive $1,500. _

Those who have already
received the most recent Aug-
mentation Grants ae sailing now.

The cost of a Semester at Sea
varies according to the living
conditions, but the student is
required to pay only the same
room and board he would if he
were a resident at Pitt, plus his
full-time tuition; the rest is
covered by the grant, Y.ucas said.

Work-Study is another way to
hold costs down,she said. When
on board, the work-study stu-
dent carries out duties in the
clerical areas and does library
work.

Federal and state grants that
students are using towards their
tuition on campus can also be
used ‘toward a Semester at Sea.

Currently, the “core” course
for the Semester at Sea Program

  Forum:
Does Football Lack Discipline?

By DIANE LEFKOWITZ

The recent arrest of two members
of the Pit Football team has become
the "straw that broke the camel's
back" in the eyes of many who
believe that Pitt athletes are not well
disciplined.

Others, however, put blame not on
the athlete's but on the media for sen-
sationalizing incidents involving ath-
letes and blowing such incidents out
of proportion.

Dr. Edward Bozik. athletic director,
said he does not believe that school
athletes are any less disciplined than
anyone else at Pitt, but that because

they are. more visible than other _stu-
dents. incidents involving them are
given more publicity.

"Because he is better known,"
Bozik said. “if he or she becomes

"involved in an incident, it seems to be

that he is given more publicity t:han
the non-athlete."

Bozik denied rumors that the
Golden Panthers, Pitt's fund-raising
organization, posted any amount of
the bond for the two players last
weekend, and that to do so, Bozik
said, would be a violation of NCAA
regulations.

' "Any cost associated with any ath-
lete that involves legal expenses is

rohibited by the NCAA," he said.
‘You cannot do it. No university
funds can be used for such pur-
poses, nor can any individual who

 

  

9  
 Pllicowcrn r
. BAND

  3?’
i5-

\

I represents the university's athletic

interests pay such expenses."

Dr. Douglass Thompson, chair-
man of the Athletics Affairs Commit-
tee, also does not believe that there is
a discipline problem among Pitt ath-
letes in particular.

"They' re students at the University
of Pittsburgh," he said. "I believe a
university should be concerned
about the behavior of all of its

_ students."

James Watters, assistant director
of the department of public safetyat
Pitt, does not single out athletes as
prime instigators of trouble.

"We have difﬁculty with individu-
als," he said. "We have no concern
about what his status or afﬁliation
with the university is."

Watters said he does not believe
that last weekend's incident wanants
any extra measures on the part of the
police.

"Past history speaks for itself. It is
not a common occurrence," he said.
"I don't believe that cases between

-students and eight policemen occur

frequently." .
Although there have been‘ inci-
dents involving Pitt athletes‘ causing
disturbances at local nightspots,
Charles Nucci. owner of Zelda's and
CJ. Barney's, said that he does not
ﬁnd problems with athletes any more

» frequent than problems with other

students.
"Our problems are few and far
between in relation to athletes,"

 

Nucci said. “I don't have a problem
with them.”

Nucci believes that the problem
comes about when the age limit is
not enforced stn'ctly—something
that he tries to do.

"If you have a place with kids who
are of age, you have fewer problems
than with a bunch of kids doing
under-age drinking," he said.

Dwight Collins, a member of the
football team, said he believes that a
lot of incidents involving athletes are
blown out of proportion.

“ Before, we didn't have all this stuff
happen to us," he said.

Collins said that there were four
other students besides the two foot-
ball players involved in last week-
end's incident.

"You didn't know about that,did
you? he said. "It's really that when a
football player is (involved) with
something, that comes out first"

Collins said he ﬁnds that there is a
stereotype about athletes on
campus—one that often is not accu-
rate but is hard to break.

"They think we get away with
murder, and they just try to pick on
us,” he said. "We don't get away with
a lot. They_think that we don't go to
class and do work. We do. We do
more than the normal students do.

"When I ﬁrst came here, I was ste-
reotyped. It isn't fair to us. There are
some of us who do come here justto
play football, but there's some of us
who come here for an education
too."

Rock Club To Open {X

By PATTI VISHNESKY

Rock-n-roll will never die, and
those who think it might should
think again. The popularity of

‘rock music is on the upswing,

and Oakland's newest night club,
Forbes Studio, is a sure cure for
the disco doldrums.

This new rock spot, equipped
with one of the most advanced
sound and lighting systems in
Pennsylvania, is located in the
rear of Capri Pizza, on Forbes
Ave. in Oakland.

Since the Feb. 7 opening, disc
jockeys from WDVE and 96KX
have been spinning discs and
activating the sound-sensitive
lighting system that creates
170,000 different light move-
ments across Oakland’s largest
dance floor.

The club is open seven nights a_
week and can accommodate 500
patrons. Beginning‘ in March,
Forbes Studio will feature area
rock bands Wednesday through
Saturday nights. -

Diego and Katherine Var-
rasso, owners of the club, estab-
lished Forbes Studio with Pitt
students in mind. -

Recently, Pitt’s swim team
held a pizza party in Forbes Stu-
dio for all participants in the Big
East ‘Swimming and Diving
Championships. The adjacent
pizza shop (Capri Pizza) supp-
lied 75 pizzas. '

The Varrassos said that they
are willing to work with other

-university organizations inter-
ested in holding such functions. .

ment, and I enjoy seeing eve-
ryone having fun."

Unlike some Oakland bars,
which have fallen into disrepair,
the Varrassos intend to keep the
club in top condition.

‘.‘After all, we are providing a
place of enjoyment and at the
same time presenting an image of
ourselves,” Varrasso said. “Who
can enjoy a rundown place with
torn seat covers.”

Currently, Scheid agrees that
there is close to a full consensus of
employees advocating a book center
union. There are several objectors.
He stated that there is never a 100
percent consensus for any type of
union-organization.

Where Scheid would like to see
more consensus is with the Pennsyl-
vania Labor Relations Board. There
has yet, to be a hearing date estab-
lished for the employees and their
unfair labor practice grievance filed
against Pitt. ’

“Pm getting frustrated with the
PLRB because thefe isn't a concrete
date set yet,” Scheid said.

Several other incidents have
transpired since the end of January.

is under review. Keith McDuffie,
chairman of the Hispanic depart-
ment, said he submitted aprop-
osal to the College of Arts and
Sciences Council that outlines
the two basic differences to the
present course, entitled “Intro-
duction to Global Issues."

One difference, McDuffie
said, is that the format of ._the
course has to be regularized by
standardizing the content of the .
course and by raising the stand- '
ards of the course.

The second difference is to
classify the course under the
proper “rubric.” Currently, it is
classiﬁed as a CAS course but is ‘
being proposed as an interdisci-
plinary course under the“Univer- .,
sity Field Services International.

McDuffie said that basicallv.
the “core" course relates students
to the trip and fills them in on the
necessary background such as
the ecological, geographical,cul-
tural, -historical and political
backgrounds of the specific pla-A
ces on the trip.

“It was supposed to be over

“So when I asked my supervisor,

. Jim Crowley, for a letter explaining

my recent performance, he said
there wasn‘t one and that he couldn’t
give a reason why the probation was

, extended.”

Scuillo further claims that Crow- _

ley talked with Mary Bonach (book
center manager) on»Feb. l8 and with
Health and Human Resources direc-
tor Al Boggs the following day to
render a decision on Scuillo.

Bookstore supervisors could not
be reached for comment.

Added to these developments is
tension at the book center. Many
employees, he explained, don’t
really look forward to going towork
every day, and some would even quit
were it not for union-organizing
effo_rts now being made.

“The tension in the air you can cut

' are only staying on to ride this thing

A few— employees have told me they
hate it there and they want to quit.
The only reason they’re staying is
because of the union vote.”

Opinion

i—Pa*ge“7’”*

The Pitt News, Friday February 25," 1983

By MARK FLAHERTY

In his State of the Union message a few
weeks ago, President Reagan called for a
constitutional amendment to permit volun-
tary school prayer. He said, “God never
should have been expelled from America’s
classrooms” in the first place. And, once

- again, the perennial arguments about prayer

in our schools have surfaced. * ~

Those who do not believe in publicischool
prayer usually base their arguments on the
First Amendment prohibitions against
“establishment of religion” and the doctrine
of separation of church and state. And, ‘since
the Engel v. \VitaIe decision in 1.962,? the
Supreme Court has ‘generally supported this
position. ‘

Those who feel that prayer should be
returned to our classrooms make several
arguments. Extremists argue that school
prayer is the only answer to the panoply of
problems existing in our nation’s educa-
tional system. But, a less extreme argument
can also be made. Some assert that a volun-

itary, non-denominational prayer would do
no harm. If we set aside the constitutional
objections concerning separation of church

and state (and the question of the stigmatiz- ~

ing effect of “voluntary” prayer), the call for

‘ school prayer does not seem wholly unreas-

onable. People who've grown up before the

  Would School Prayer DoAny Good?

-person is entitled to his Or her individual mindlessness that characterizesatypical rec-

beliefs. Prayer is a matter of personal con-
science. And, in the proper context, group
prayer may be a means to greater spiritual
fulﬁllment. The sanctity of religious practice
(or non-practice) is a given that I do not wish
to debate.

‘...Schoo/ prayer would probably just create one more
meaningless routine forstudents to follow.’ , T

Vitale decision often say, “We had to pray

when I went to school, and it didn’t do us any .

harm.” - L -

. Aside from the constitutional questions
which school prayer raises, I would like to
examine the other side of the above asser-
tion. Accepting, for the sake of argument,
that school prayer.wouldn‘t do any harm,
the obvious question arises: Wouldit do any
good? I think not, despite the good inten-
tions of, those who favor a prayer
amendment. -

I must emphasize that I am not deprecat-
ing prayer, nor do I question its value. Each

But, what happens to this type of highly
personal, individual belief in a secular con-
text? What form would prayer most likely
take in public schools?

It is probable that group prayer in schools
would be quite -different from that which
takes place in churches or synagogues.
Rather than being a significant moral and
religious experience, school prayer is more
likely to become a rote exercise. It takes no
great stretch of _the imagination for one to
visualize classrooms across the nation in
which students dutifully parrot-off their
morning prayers with the same detatched

J

itation of the Pledge of Allegiance.

The likely result of a prayer amendment
would not be a cataclysm of new-found mor-
ality among our youth. That spark must
come from church andifamily.

Realistically, school prayer would proba-
bly just create one more meaningless routine
for students to follow. Any student who
wants to" pray privately and sincerely still
may, in school or out. Teachers do not have
the means to keep a student from praying.
They cannot chain a free conscience. And
mechanical catechisms cannot replace heart-
felt individual sentiment.

President Reagan’s mention of the school
prayer amendment is probably less indica-

tive of a primary policy goal than it is a »

feeble attempt to shore up his crumbling
right-wing constituency. But,‘ if Reagan is
truly. concerned about the state of our
nation's educational system, he should focus

on his proposals to upgrade education

assistance to the states. The battle that needs
to be waged is the one against crumbling
facilities and substandard curriculums. Cos-
metic moral posturing is of dubious utility.

:By DANA B. POLAN

As the classic Hollywood system
falls further and further apart, one
,-increasingly has the sense that Hol-
xlywood filmmakers are resorting to
the past—to what's already been

inspirations. In the best of cases, this
redoing of the past can\lead to a crea-
tive reworking, in which old myths are
critically re-examined for their rele-
vance, or irrelevance, to modern con-
cerns. This, for example, is the case
with a film like The Howling, a marve-
lous updating of the werewolf legend
to merge it with the contemporary
concerns of the new, hedonistic "me”
generation.

But in the worst of cases, Holly-

4’)"pwood’s fascination of the past can

 

lfsignal a lack of imagination, ‘the

retreat to seemingly sure-fire for-
mulae with little attempt to do any-
thing interesting with those
formulae. This is the case of Lovesick.
Lovesick is a downright terrible

’Lovesick’

Nauseates

movie‘—a situation and development
that seem to have been written by a
computer program that has digested
bits of other movies. Director and
screenwriter Marshall Brickman,
who has worked with Woody Allen,
seems to have no imagination of his
own, so he simply rehashes Woody
Allen situations. The basic
premise—a New York psychiatrist
who falls in love with a patient—is
simply a transposition of Allen plots,
so much so that the film's central gag
(the ghost of Sigmund Freud appears
to advise the psychiatrist on his fan-
tasies) seems little more than a
rehash of Play It Again, Sam's wonder-
ful idea of Bogart’s ghost appearing
to advise that film's hero.

About "the only way to-avoid get-
ting sick at Lovesick is to watch the
film only for its ripoffs: for example,
Dudley Moore's captivation with a
beautiful woman is right out of I 0 (as
is a painfully directed sequence of
Moorehobbling spastically after his
love); Elizabeth McGovern’s che-

_rubic innocence seems a redoing of
 

  RESIDENT STUD

Audience

Mariel Hemingway's character in

_ . Manhattan, etc., etc.

The'film gives us the easy New
York targets-—pretentious actors,
crabby social workers, chic but
empty art gallery owners, spacey
artists, loloney street people—but
does nothing with them. Characters

are paraded on and off the screen '

with little energy or attention.
Many Hollywood films today start
as package deals: put together a list
of actors and actresses and then (and
only then) worry about something to
do with them. Lovesick appears to be a
perfect example of this new tactic of
filmmaking. There are great people
here—Alec Guiness, Wally Shawn,
Iohn Huston (whose falling-asleep
scenes almost seem to be a comment
on his interest in the movie itself),
Renee Taylor, Alan. King—but

nothing is done with them. I.ovesick.is ,

a lackluster non-entity; that anyone
felt any kind of interest in making it
is a depressing indication of where
too much of today's ”thinking” in
Hollywood is.

THE WHO: MAXIMUM R & B
Richard Barnes
St. Martin's Press

The release of this book coincided
with The Who's departure on their
'-'-Is it hype yet?" final, goodbye, but
"oh, maybe we'll back” tour of North
America. While the bad taste of that
extravaganza lingers on, the beauty
and sweep of this book is enough to
make any Who fan or rock follower
forgive and forget, or at least sleep
better at night.

Richard "Barnes has compiled an
impressive written and photographic
history of rock's most misunderstood
band, and although the analysis is
minimal, the sheer abundance of
information will allow the reader to
draw conclusions when and where
they seem fit. Barnes has been there
since the band's inception (he came
up with the name The Who), but
unlike so many insider's guides to the
stars, he "hasn't merely spliced
together ‘the gross and gossipy out-
takes for every crazed fan's delight.
Oh, the moments of Who eccentrici-

V .u

"-—l:—'r{: . 1.-

 

ties are there, but more importantly,
so are insights into the group's devel-
opment from a Trad Jazz outfit to the
world's biggest travelling nemesis
and possibly greatest rock-n-roll
band.

For the generation once removed
from mods and rockers and British
invasions etc., the history provided
here is requisite to understanding.
music now and then. What better
way to learn of it all then through the
rise of the one band that stood as
testament to "the scene." Maximum
R618 has just as much to offer the
more battle—weary follower, for even
if the writing should become review
material, the incredible photos give
the book, and the band, an even more
penetrating dimension. The shots of
Entwistle and Moon as toddlers con-
trast the two as well as any analysis
ever could. * I

Barnes retains a style and flow
about his writing while being careful
not to go too far "in house” as to lose
the readers in atmosphere. It may not
be the most critical book written
about a band, but few could rival it in

NEEN IN ROCK
Various authors
Delilah '

We're all in the same boat, me, Lene

Lovich, Chrissie Hynde. We haven't spentthe

last five years shopping at the supermarket.
We've been in bands, getting ready. And there
are a lot more women in the way. The door is
now open....

Martha Davis, lead
singer of the Motels

Of course, women have been mak-
ing rock and roll for years, but it's
only in the last decade or so that a
large number of women have gained
the same super—status in rock that
men have always had. With few
exceptions (most notably Janis Joplin
and Grace Slick), most of the female
singers before this period were "nice"
girls who didn't write their own
material, play an instrument or,
excuse the phrase, kick out the jams
in concert. Ronnie Spector, for exam-
ple, was a fine singer, but you can't
compare her to someone like Siouxsie
Sioux, who more exemplifies the

woman rocker of. the '70s-'80s. And"

this latter group is what New Womewln
Rock is all about.

NWIR is a beautifully-illustrated,
96-page of ‘glossy soft-back that
includes approximately one page of
background information on each of

 

   

   

the 68 female rockers the editor
deemed relevant to recent music ‘his-
tory. If you can get past the slightly
annoying fact that nearly all of the
copy about the artists was written by
British journalists (some of whom, I
might add, aren't very good), you'll
find the information very interesting
and especially useful for R &; R aficio-

XFIOIS HISXIIOIS

 

nados. You'll learn, for instance, that
Holly Beth Vincent (of Holly and the
Italians fame) used to be a masseuse
and "bondage mistress” for a high-
class L.A. whorehouse and that Lene
Lovich, while working as a saxo-
phone player in Europe, picked up‘
‘extra money by dubbing screams for
French horror movies. This is great
coffee-table material.
Editor Liz Thomson has compiled a

comprehensive list of every woman

"in rock who's made a lasting contri-

bution in rock and roll in the last few
years, and then some. Not only do
you get Pat Benatar, Kim Carnes,
Debbie Harry, Joan Iett, Rickie Lee
Jones, Bette Midler, The Pointer Sis-
ters, Patti Smith and Ann and Nancy
Wilson, but also Annabella (Bow
Wow Wow),-The Belle Stars, Clare’
Grogan (Altered Images),

Jane Munro and Lesley Woods (The
Au Pairs), The Raincoats, The Slits,
Ivy Rorschach (The Cramps), Wendy
Wu and many, many more. '

New Women In Rock is an ambitious
look at the ladies who've proved that
men aren't the only ones who can

rock and roll. And Martha's right— ~

you can bet there's more on the way.‘

SOUND
By Alan Betrock
Delilah Books

Most of the history of rock-n-roll
remains to be written. While some of
the music's sides seem to be overwrit-
ten’(for example, with Albert Gold-
mann’s bio of Presley, we know more
about Elvis than we probably ever
wanted to know), . other essential
moments in the history remain blank
slates. ’ Therefore, simply for the
wealth of its research on one of those
blanks, Alan Betrocl<’s Girl Groups is a
welcome additionto the rock history
library.

rock's first vitality in the '50s and just

A pated the folk rock of the.’60s, the girl
groups sang to the hearts of Ameri-
can teenagers and shaped a dominant
ideology of teenage love and commit-
ment. If the themes of the songs
were, at their worst, sticky odes to
undying devotion,.at their best, the
songs could speak with a raunchy
energy of the problems of youthful
desire in an age all too governed by
Cold War'Puritan standards. J

Betrock concentrates on the busi-
ness behind the girl groups and pro-
vides in-depth chronicles of the
participation of producers (for exam-
ple, Phil Spector, a prime mover
behind the girl-group sound), song-
writers (for example, Carole King),
and the groups themselves. He care-
fully details the formation of the
groups, their inevitable rise to suc-
cess and their just-as-inevitable fall
(usually through mismanagement of
funds).

And yet the sheer necessity to first
get the facts—a real necessity given
the state of rocklhistoriography—
means that Betrock has little time for
an equally necessary analysis of those
facts. We learn what the economic
and institutional foundations of the
girl-group sound were, but we never
find out what that sound sounded
like. Paradoxes that cry out for inter-
pretation remain unexamined: what,
for example, does it mean that

THE BOOK OF ROCK QUOTES
Compiled by Jonathon Green
Delilah Books

This is the second edition of Rock
Quotes, a revised edition that includes
many quotations that the original
1977 version did not, many of which

come from rock's newest infants like .

John Lydona.l<.a. Rotten, Malcolm
McLaren, Bob Geldorf, Mick Jones
and Debbie Harry. And, while these
more recent contributions are cer-

.tain'ly as amusing ,as the previous I
ones, they do very little in the way of

upholding rock-n-roll’s shaky grasp
on profundity. Given their chance to
speak out, most of these ”street-
poets" choose to pontificate on their
drug and copulation habits instead of
anything relevant. Witness former

There's more where that came
from, (in fact there's a whole chapter
on sex), but that's just the problem.
Many of these quotes are mindless
and have no place in a book of mem-
orable rock quotes. But on the other
hand, the dumber or sleazier the
quote, the more I like it....

”I manage to look so young because
I'm mentally retarded.”—Debbie
Harry, who knows what she’s talking

\ about.

"I like Bianca Jagger because she is
one of the few women I know who
has as .much class and style as I
have.”——Britt Ekland, who doesn't
know what she's talking about.

”If I find. myself in bed with another

I living thing, I tend to treat it as a

sexual object."—Jean Jacques Burnel
of The Stranglers

”My big fantasy is to seduce a
priest.”—Linda Ronstadt, who nearly
got her wish with Jerry Brown, a
former Jesuit.

”Reporting I'm drunk is like saying

I decidedto go cold turkey.”-Debby
’7Junkie" Boone

”I think pop music has done more
for oral intercourse than anything
else that ever happened, and vice

.versa."—Frank Zappa

Subsequently, after reading
through all of these unintelligent
rantings, I'm left to wonder if the

late, great Lester Bangs (the greatest _

rock and roll writer who ever lived)

wasn't right when he said, ”Rock and.

THE DISTANCE
Bob Seger '
Capitol

Bob Seger has spent the past
two years paying for the sins of

his own success, and even now 1

that he's put out an album that
clearly redeems his Detroit soul,
will anyone recognize penance
done? Since riding the mid-
tempo craftiness of Against The

Wind to the tops of the charts, A

Seger has been stripped of

« ’garage-hero status and resigned

-to the ranks of the sold-out
artists. The Distance could,
should, change all of the that,
but given the pastoral cover art
and label-chosen single release
of "Shame On The Moon," who
would be blamed for melting

_ their copy'of Ramblin' Gamblin'

Man into an ashtray?

If you can ignore that first
impression, you'll find an album
marking a return to Seger’s
well—rooted, guitar-grinding
blues with songs like the sadly

' ~ nostalgic yet inescapably funky

"'Makin' Thunderbirds." The
biting guitars and snarling
growl of Seger’s voice grow

i even more rustic on ”Boom—

g-

3".-':§.“~‘ v‘ ‘ '. ‘»L‘I_~./-.'z'-"‘

town Blues"_ and "Little
Victories.”

Remarkably, it's not on that
turf that we find Seger’s best
here. Instead, it's the combina-
tion of producer Jimmy Iovine,
the best studio musician rock_
has to offer, and Seger’s most
intimate lyrics to date that make
The Distance so exhilarating.

Iovine’s ' presence is felt
strongest on the opening cuts of
both sides. "Even Now" begins
with the sparkling drops of vis-

iting E. Streeter Roy Bittan’s
piano, which coupled with
Iovine’s dense, yet explosively
clear, production, give Seger the
sound to match this song about
distances of both theroad and
the heart. The same’ is true on
"Roll Me Away,” which almost
soars right out of Seger’s range.

The likenesses to Iovine’s past " A

work, most notably where
Springsteen is concerned, are so
obvious that they needn't be

wondered or whispered about, '

only enjoyed.

Nestled in between the bluesy
rockers and the sweeping
‘anthems lie two ballads, "Love's
The Last To Know" and "Com-
ing. Home," which raise Seger’s
use of the form tonew heights.
The former is built around the
keyboards of ex—Little Feat
pianist Bill ne and accented
by survivinlyBulleteer Craig
Frost's orga "Coming Home"
tells of erasing some of the same
distances which1"Roll Me" and
"Even Now" struggled to create

and does so without «a trace of l

the maudlin sentiment that
plagued "Fire Lake" or "Against
The Wind."

Seger stands at some type of

crossroads now with at least .
‘part of his Silver Bullet Band

departed and many, many long
years of hard work behind him.
It's both ironic and dismal that

someone such as he would have '
' to pro‘ve himself all over again.

The Distance does atleast that
much, signalling a revitalized
and redeemed Bob Seger who
can both haul theyold road and
still find the new and not so
beaten path.

' Another Page

Warner Bros.
While most Americans

watched Christopher Cross
walk away with four Grammies
in 1980 for his debut album,
many were heard to mumble:
"It's just beginner's luck." Even
‘after he won an Academy
Award the following year'for
"Arthur's Theme,” most were
still doubtful about the man's
music. _
Cross. proves most of his

skeptics wrong with the release '

of his long-awaited second
album, Another Page. The pink-
flamingo-loving Cross belts out
song after song about broken
hearts and love gone wrong.
' Helping Cross out on Another
Page are artists ].D. Souther,
Michael McDonald, Carl Wilson
and --Karla Bonoff. Luckily, the
input theseartists provide is
minimal. However, on "Talking
in_ My Sleep," Cross initiates
help from oldie Art Garfunkel,
and his presence is felt through
the lyrics and the background
vocals. ’

While the albumlac-ks power-

ful cuts such as ”Sailing" and
”Ride With the Wind," there are
a few that have the potential to
be hit singles. Surprisingly, the
current Top 40 hit from the
album, ”All Right," is the worst
song on the LP. "What Am I
Supposed to Believe” is a lovely
ballad Cross singswith Bonoff.
So, chances are, Cross will jump
on the duo bandwagon that is
popular right now and release
this cut as a single. It's one of the
best on the album and should
climb the charts with ease.
' Cross may have been accused
of beginner's luck, but Another
Page will continue his streak and
should show _the rest of the
world that Texans can sing
songs of love for women instead
of just I about cows and
armadillos.

"Signof the Times”/"Madness"
Belle Stars
Stiff (U.I(. import)

After listening to Bananara-
ma's latest single, I have to
wonder: was it all just luck?
Their back-up work for Fun Boy
Three (especially "T'Aint What
You Do”), their own dance-club
smash, "Really Saying Some-
thing,” and a great single called
"Shy Boy" backed with their
original-penned "Don't Call
Us,” may all have been good
timing/managementlfate. I

They've always sung in a
dead-pan. manner, but the
vocals on "Cheers Then" are
ridiculously lack-luster—the
girls sound as if they're about to
fall asleep any second. Banana-
rama have always borrowed
heavily from a heavy funk beat
in the past, which, ironically
(considering they're three white
girls with so-so voices) worked
well for them, but they've toned

down the association this time, ’

and the results are a total yawn.
Buy their "old" stuff-
Bananarama's milli-second of
fame is. just about over.

The best all-girl group in
existence, The Belle Stars, just
keep on getting better. "Sign Of
The Times" is holding at No. 3
on the British charts, and no one
should be surprised if it goes on
to No. 1. It has the usual Stars’
style of a lively, whirlwind beat,
husky vocals and lots of horns
and hand claps (on the B side
anyway), and the B side, is an
added treat; "Madness" is every
bit as good as "Sign Of The
Times,” and some people may
like it better, for it sounds
almost Dazz Band-fish in
structure.

SCANDAL
Scandal
Columbia

The best thing about this
five-track mini album is its wil-
lingness to please; the worst
thing is that it never. gets
beyond this point—-inste_ad of

trying’ something new, Scandal .

settles for a playing-it-safe for-
mula. The players are inspired
enough, meaning that the per-

formance and delivery are top-

notch, however, the underlying
base—the arrangements, the
exact musical notes—'just
doesn't match that initial
exuberance.

But Scandal are by no means

_ undeserving of attention (hey,

if John Cougar is rock's new
messiah for a majority of Amer-
ican pre-fabs, then why not
Scandal?). Patty Smyth is a
punchy, rough—voiced vocalist
who, along with Zack Smith
(guitarist and songwriter), is
the band's greatest asset.
"Goodbye To You," the single
that's on heavy rotation on

MTV and picking up extensive.

radio play, is the best of the five
tracks, with Smyth's sassiness
at its best, \

When you get right down to
it, Scandal is a fine pop band; it's
just that they seem to« have

Cast Trimmed y

.By LINDA HENRY

Takelan extremely talented cast
that blends together like the close-
knit family it portrays, add a wonder-
ful set, and the result should be
theatre to tickle the palate. Ladyhouse
Blues, written by Kevin O’Morrison
and referred to as a ”haunting,
atmospheric drama,” somehow
curdles.

The production is pungent, but the
tears are stimulated by Ruth Lesko’s
stirring performances as a mother
struggling to keep her family
together during the period in Ameri-
can history following World War I,
not by any feeling for the character
she portrays. It is as if we are told a
hardship story by some not-so-close
neighbors; after the story is over, we

gripped. If it were not for the magnif-
icent cast, which gives more spice to
the script than it deserves, we would
be bored.

But the cast is wonderful. Besides
the gifted Lesko, there is Lisa Tomp-

Lady Panthers Fall To Villanova Despite Statistics

By LAURIE KUBLI

In an important Big East basket-

 -ball match-up‘, the Lady Panthers

‘ fast to Villanova at the Wildcat

Field House, 79-64, last Wednesday.

“We were working for a number-
two seedingin the NCAA, touma-
ment,” said assistant coach Janet
Gabriel said. “The loss will probably

~ drop us to four.”

Time is running out for the 16-9

Panthers, who are 5-3 against Big
East opponents and have just one
non-conference game remaining.
Statistically, the teams were
nearly equal. In fact, both teams
committed I7 turnovers. But, Pitt
pulled down 36 rebounds while Vil-
lanova grabbed 55. This one glaring

- difference was the difference.

“No rebounds. It really hurts us

' not to get off those second and third
shots,” Gabriel said. “If we don't get

Panthers To Rebound
” Against Boston College?

By SCOTT DEl;LETT

An index of an improving basket-
ball team is how it recovers from a
major setback. The Panther basket-
ball team has faced many obstacles
during the 1982-83 season. Pitt has
still another crisis to solve as they
face Boston College tomorrow night
at 8 pm. at the Fitzgerald Field
House.

The Panthers were on the road to

- a possible National Invitational
Tournament bid when last place
Seton Hall upset Pitt 74-68 Tuesday
night, breaking a 15-game winless

»-.,.streak in the Big East conference.

' ‘ l.{Now, the Panthers may struggle to ;

reach the .500 mark at the end of the
season as they face Providence and
St. J ohn’s on the road after the Bos-

I ton College game.

Assistant coach Reggie Warford
knows the team has faced problems
earlier this season, and tomorrow's
game is another test for Pitt.

“We have faced adversity during

this season, especially after the Vil- '

lanova and Boston College games,”
he said. “We didn’t play as well as we
like to. The Seton Hall game proved
that there’s no easy games in this
conference. ‘ '

“Seton Hall may have had the bad
record, but they have some young

s.
The source of Pitt’s recent prob-
lems has been one that plagued the
team earlier this season. The Panth-
ers are not getting any offensive pro-
duction out of their centers.
Sophomore Andre Williams has
constantly been in foul trouble—
fouling out of 10 of 22 games this
season. With these difficulties, Willi-

worker. He has guided Pitt to
two consecutive NCAA tourna-
ment. appearances. This year,

starting at the center spot, but a bad
case of the ﬂue kept him out of the
Seton Hall game and may prevent
him from playing tomorrow night.

“Andre has not’ been playing
well,” Warford said. “He’s been try-
ing to overcompensate, and his frus-
tration has lead him into foul

- trouble. .

“Andre is an intelligent player,
but he's in a hole that players some-
times get in, and he’s having a hard
time getting out.”

With the status of Miklasevich
uncertain, the decision as to who will
start at center will be held off.

“The_decision hasn't been made
yet,” Warford said. “Coach Chip-
man will have to think hard on this
matter. ‘

“One of those guys will have to i

come out front.”

An effective center is necessary to
contain the Eagle front line of for-
wards Jay Murphy and Martin
Clark and center John Barris. Barris
was the offensive star in the last
meeting at Chestnut Hill, scoring 22
points in the first half. For the sea-
son , the~6-8 senior leads the Eagles
in scoring,_ averaging 19.5 points per
game, and is second in_ rebounding,
hauling in 7.3 rebounds per contest.
Murphy is second in scoringwith a
17.5 average and leads Boston Col-
lege in rebounding.

But the main force on which the
Panthers have to concentrate is 5-10
sophomore guard Michael Adams.
Adams is third on the squad in scor-
ing, averaging 16.6 points per game,
but his ability to penetrate has been

an effective tool in their running’

game, averaging over 86 points per
contest.

“Michael Adams should give a
challenge to George Allen, Billy Cul-
bertson and Joey David,” Warford

continued on page nineteen

Chipman’s Panthers have done

the impossible——defeated three
Top 20 teams—Georgetown,
Syracuse and St. John’s.

The above statistics provide a
well-ﬁtted mask. Wins, tourna-
ments and upsets aside, Chipman
still lacks the big name center, the
guy that makes the other team
wish they had remained home for
the weekend, a player who can
carry a team on his shoulders into
the national rankings. Andre
Williams is an average center,
and the individuals playing
behind him-—Matt Miklasevich
and Keith Armstrong—are less
than that.

The problem has been noticea-
ble even in victory. Oh, it's not
necessarily associated with
rebounding; little Clyde
Vaughan is averaging nearly nine‘
per contest, third best in the Big

the ballgand run it back down the
court for an easybasket.

“We’re.taller, but they're very fast.
Their guards can do it all.”

Pitt shot just 35.7 percent from
the field.“ From the foul line, the
Lady Panthers made 85.7 percent,
while Villanova sank 23 of 36 for
63.8 percent. However, the Wildcats
had 15 more chances. In the first half,
Pitt went to the line only four times
while Villanova attempted 17 free
throws. .

Scoring in double figures for the
Lady Panthers were Jennifer Bruce
with 20 points and 16 rebounds and
Pam Miklasevich with 14 points.
The game's leading scorer was Vil-
lan_ova’s Nancy Bernhardt with 27
points while teammate Kathie Beisel
added I19. Bernhardt also had seven
rebounds while Beisel grabbed 13.

Pitt’s final game is against 18th-
ranked Rutgers on Saturday at the
Fitzgerald Field House. Seniors

_Pam Miklasevich and Lynn Love,

playing in the final game of their
collegiate careers will be honored.

Gabriel said that Rutgers plays
like Villanova.

“Their inside people aren‘t as
good as ours, but their guards are
comparable to Villanova’s—they‘re
really good,” Gabriel said. “They
also have a successful fastbreak. We
really need to work on our rebound-
ing and control the boards in order
to win this one....It should be an
interesting game.”

Tlger Paul Auslander recently returned to put a charge In
Fltzgerald Field House.

Auslander
Returns
To Lend
A Hand

By JOE zerr

Back in the days when basketball
Coach Roy Chipman would drone
on endlessly about how the Pan-
thers’ entry in "the Big East Confer-
ence was one step backwards for two
steps forward, Pitt trailed Provi-
dence by ll points at halftime.

While most of the action was taking _
place on the hardwood floor of Fitz-

gerald Field House, another juicy
plot was thickening near an end seat
in the reserved section.

Tiger Paul Auslander was sum-
moned back.

Forget that former athletic direc-
tor Casimir Myslinski last year ban-
ished him from anywhere near a
basketball court on which Pitt per-
formed.‘ Forget that cheerleader
coach Karen Agostinella literally
wrung his neck after he upstaged the
cheerleaders during a game last sea-
son. Set those facts aside; Auslander
has returned.

He was just one of 5,835 specta-
tors when the Providence game
began, but that changed once the
fans discovered that Auslander, a
39-year-old resident of Squirrel Hill,
was seated in the stands.

“The students spotted me and
kept calling for me, and I kept saying
‘no,’ ” Auslander says. “They con-
tinued to call for me, and I con-
tinued to say ‘no.’ But when the

. game went into overtime, I just had
to go down.”

He made his way down behind the

press table—he would have pro-

ceeded onto the court but, as he says,
“I didn’t have my tennis shoes." The

East. Or not even Williams‘ point
totals; he’s scoring over 10 a
game.

But there are other factors.
Like Vaughan's staring into a
bunch of hands every time he
looks at the basket, which is both
a comment on the amount of
respect given to Vaughan and the
lack of respect given to Pitt’s
inside game.

Like Joey David, perhaps the
finest pureoutside shooter Pitt
has had since Pete Strickland,
who has difficulty freeing himself
for an open shot. Put David on
the same team as Patrick Ewing
or Ralph Sampson, who have a
tendency to force defenses closer
to the basket, and he’d be a 20-
point scorer. Vaughan might be a
30-point player.

Like ‘Williams regularly

A Big Name Center Can Carry Pitt To

amassing of three fouls before
halftime. Chipman has recently
countered this problem by start-
ing Miklasevich or Armstrong,
keeping Williams secure from
early foul trouble. The move
worked well against George-
town. ‘

It doesn't, however, appear to
be a long—term solution, at least
not for a team reaching for the
Top 20, a team looking to build
its basketball program into a
giant. To reach the big time,
they'll need the big boys. Not
necessarily a Sampson or
Ewing—those kind of players
come along about once every ice
age—but say, a Steve Stipano-
vich of Missouri. Not someoneto
tear down the rims, just a center
who can relieve some pressure
from Vaughan and the guards.

Which raises another problem.

Rankings

Pitt has only cne scholarship left
to offer next season. That is,
unless it plans on taking scholar-
ships away from members of this
year’s team, which is quite possi-
ble. Pitt has a young team, but if
it hopes to progress in the Big
East, it needs to recruit more
than one player.

The recent upsets and an
appearance on national televi-
sion are great recruiting tools, as
long as there are players to be
recruited. Pitt has achieved con-
siderable success this year,
enhancing its reputation. Cer-
tainly, they could land some top-
caliber high school talent. Maybe
even an All-America player or an
upper level center.

It would make Chipman’s job
much easier. And they wouldn't
question whether he regularly
carries ahorseshoe. ,-

Tonight, the Pitt Lady Panthers
will face Florida at the Fitzgerald
Field House at 7:30 pm. The Gators
will be Pitt’s most ominous oppo-
nent so far this season.

Florida placed seventh in the
NCAA Nationals last year,.and this
year are ranked among the top 10.

“They are the strongest team we
have met so far this season,” head
coach Donna Sanft said. “Florida
possesses the ability to score as high
as 180.” _ _

The Lady Panthers have a big job
on their hands. They have been pre-
paring all week long, both mentally
and physically. Their last meet at

' Penn State was discouraging, with

'unexpected breaks causing them to

perform poorly.

“We are practicing hard and prac-
ticing as if we are in a meet situa-
tion,” Sanft said. “Practices have
been going well, and I do believe we
have composed ourselves-after our
discouragement at Penn State.”

It is crucial that the Lady Panth-
ers hit in their remaining meets,
Florida, Ohio State and Clarion in
order to accumulate a qualifying
score for regional competition.

The Lady Panthers are now
among the top 10 teams to qualify
for regionals, but they have to be
among the top seven.

“We are aiming for a high team
total, around l70,” Sanft said. “In
orderto do this we must aim fora
consistent meet and hit routines on
each event."

Tri- Meet To

By SARA STRICKLAND

The Lady Panther gymnasts came
up_with a less than impressive per-
formance at their tri-meet last wee-
end," scoring_l65.2 to place behind
Penn State and West Virginia. The
Lady Lions took first place with a
score of 176.5, and the Lady Moun-
taineers finished second with 169.95.

Although Pitt's team score was
behind those of its two Eastern
rivals, there were two standout per-
formers in the meet. Junior Karen
Martin took third in the all-around
with a score of 35.5. She also shared
second in the vault and uneven bars
and placed third on the ﬂoor and
beam events.

Kristy Pieters placed ninth in the
all-around with a score of 34.05. She
also had respectable performances

on the uneven bars and balance bars ’

with scores of 8:75 and 8.6
respectively.

 

The performance of the Lady
Panthers was not up to par; Coach
Donna Sanft didn’t see any
improvement from the squad.

“It was our worst meet this sea-
son,” she said.‘ “We started out with 
a bad warmup, and we couldn’t seem‘ 7'
to get our concentration back on
track.”

Pitt has been preparing this week
to meet Florida tonight.

“We will practice like we will com-
pete,” Sanft said. “Hopefully, this
strategy will help us overcome our
nervousness during competition.”

It is important for the Lady
Panther gymnasts to score in the
l70’s to assure themselves a spot in
the Eastern Regionals.

“Hopefully, Florida and Clarion,
our last two home meets, will be high
on scoring," Sanft said. “This would
definitely give us a great chance to
qualify for regional.” -

.,/Reilly, Spikers Set For Rutgers

By MARK A. SINDLER

With two matches in two days, the
Panther volleyball team ﬁnds itself
in a state of flux. In the past, much
has been emphasized in'the squad,
which began its season with a ﬂurry
of tournaments. That meant
pressure-packed weekends of ﬁve
matches in two- or three-day
periods. '

 -3:: Now the league-play season has

.‘a

"started, meaning that matches are
now scheduled once—at the most,
twice——a week. What the change-
over from intense competition to
best-of-five matches once a week
calls for is a change in attitude—not
in the team or in discipline, but in
preparation.

, To date, that changeover has not ‘

‘surfaced. Since their last tourna-
ment, the Panthers easily squashed
Edinboro in three straight games but
had a case of severe jitters when fac-
ing George Mason two days later.

If the Panthers expect to finish
second in the East behind Penn
State, they have to beat the teams

 George Mason.(George Mason H

=  w s ranked ninth or tenth in the pre-

’ season, but Pitt coach Ray Reilly
has stated on several occasions in the

I past that the Panthers are a better
team in all departments.

Getting knocked out cold on its
home floor as the team was against
George Mason last Saturday is no
way for it to show that it is ready to
begin its march to the second best in

‘the East. Again, a change in atti-
tudes dealing with preparation and
pacgrg is necessary.

The chance will come this week-
end when Pitt catches up with two
league rivals, East Stroudsburg and
Rutgers-Newark. The only problem

_- " the fact that Pitt has yet to win on
“' the Scarlet Knights’ home court_.

They have been tough in thepast,
and this season is no different.
Coach Eric Pavel is in his first year,
but his squad bosts an 8-1 mark, 1-0
in the Eastern Collegiate Volleyball
League.

That lone loss came against
George Mason last week, the same
Patriot team that devoured the
Panthers 3-l, giving Pitt an 0-1
record in the ECVL, an ll-8-1
record overall;

If there can be any thoughts of ‘_

Pitt's defeating Rutgers on Satur-
day, the only reason would be that
both schools are undergoing
rebuilding years. Rutgers graduated

~ -:_.:4jive players last year, a fact of which

, _‘-‘

Reilly plans to take advantage.

“I like to thinkthat we can beat
them,” he said.‘ “They lost a 6-8
monster who could jump pretty well
but really wasn’t a good net player.

mntmu('d from page .s‘evmzt()m2
said. “You have to stop him—he’s
the catalyst to their first break.”

Stopping Adams is not easy. War-
ford admits there’s.no sure-ﬁre for-
mula to stop Adams‘ twisting,
spinning—sometimes beyond
human play.

A“You have to say to yourself, ‘I
don’t want a 94 foot game,‘ " he said.
“They have to prevent Adams from
making things happen.”

Pitt returns to the friendly con-
fines of the Fitzgerald Field House
for the last time this season.
Already, three nationally ranked

 teams have been upset by the Panth-

ers, but Boston College may have
the maturity to prevent another
upset.

“I think Boston College is one of
the better teams on the road,” War-
ford said. “They are tournament-
tested, and they are confident.

Boston College may be able to han-i

dle the pressure. -~

And in the past, we’ve always played
them tough, always going five
games." ‘

The Scarlet Knights’ height,
Reilly added, should again be over-
bearing this season, as should their

defense and hustle capabilities..

Reilly added that Rutgers also
benefits from their offering of scho-
larship money, making Pitt’-Rugers
matches “the top-notch versus the
next-best kid.”

In tonight's match-up with East
Stroudsburg, Reilly should expect
to see another match like Edinboro.
The Warriors are starting the year
after dropping from Division I com-
petition and are ‘now playing under
varsity sport status. The drop was
due to finances. But, Pitt has easily
handled East Stroudsburg on pre-

vious occasions. East Stroudsburg,

does have some ﬂair, though. The
Warriors recently acquired a South
American freshman who starts.

People seem to think, Reilly later
said, that the foreigner quality
makes a more well-rounded squad.
Reilly has considered the idea of
importing such quality but dispels
the notion since he believes “the
players [in the United States] are just
as good.” Besides, that isn’t Reilly’s
big concern now. He has got to start
turning out the victories—at least in
a better proportion to the losses.

“We’re gettingdown to a more
intense game now,” Reilly said. “The
past weekend woke ‘us up a little.
We’re not going to takeanything for
granted, especially after that George
Mason match.”

Last year at the Eastern Wrestling

Penn State, Pitt's. wrestling team
was expected to be battling with
Millersville State for last place in the
East. The Panthers were 2-5 in
league competition and were the

year before.

But suddenly, the Pitt squad came
alive to capture fourth place, much
to the amazement of spectators and

The Panther squad looks a little
better this year, going into the tour-
nament tonight and tomorrow at
Clarion State College with a 3-4 ,
league record and several bright
individual stars. But a swarm of
injuries mean the Panthers will
again have to pull out some big
surprises.

Heavy favorites expected to qual-

ify for the NCAA Championships _,

are Captains Joe Throclcmortonf
(134 lbs.), and Jeff Jelic (158 lbs.)
and senior Kurt Karanovich (190
lbs.)

Throckmorton, who was a third
place winner in last year’s touma-
ment, goes in this year with a 14-6
record for the year. He has lost twice
this year in EWL competition and is
expecting a third place seed at 134
lbs.

J elic is the defending champion at
158 lbs., but several losses during the -
year leaves his seeding up in the air.
Jelic has a 16-7 record.

At 190 lbs., Karanovich enters the
tournament with a 14-3-1 record.
Two of his three losses came in EWL

competition, so he too is expecting a“<§J;;-

third place seeding.

Pitt’s Kyle Nellis goes into the
tournament with a 14-9 record at
118 lbs., while the only other
Panther regulars, heavyweight Dan
Kasperkoski (6-l0-l) and 126
pounder Rich Esswein (5-ll) will
also see action.

With the injuries during the year,
Pitt has to fill in where it can. The
losses of defending 1501b. champion
Doug Haines and last year’s fourth-
place winner Frank Rich forces Pitt
to show three 150 pounders in their
line-up. .

Eric Wertz will get the call at 150

C /

lbs., replacing regular starter Joe,

jumping up a few weights to fill in;
Moyer at 167 lbs. and Augello at

“Our guys are pretty tired after
last week’s Big East meet,” head
coach John Vasvary said. “We want
to do well, but it is certainly not like
the Big East.” i ‘

' The West Virginia meet, though, -- -

still has some significance for several
Panthers. “The meet gives a couple

Vasvary said that Brian Pollock,

Auslander’s Return Sparks Pitt, Field House Crowdﬁ,

' continued from page seventeen

 matchbox known as Fitzgerald

Field House immediately caught
fire.‘ Pitt converted a 14-point
second-half deﬁcit into a resounding

. 59-55 double overtime victory..

If Andre Previn could make mad
dashes from one end of a basketball
court to the other while pumping his

” arms skyward like hydraulic pistons,

he would look very much like Aus-
lander. Tiger Paul's orchestra com-
prises as many as 7,000 pieces, which
under his command can make beau-
tiful music in a Panther box score.

The crowd has been instrumental
in each of the past three contests at
Fitzgerald Field House since Aus-
lander has regained his stronghold
as Pitt's top cheerleader. The Pan-
thers have shaken press rooms

"throughout the country, toppling

such powers as St. John's, Syracuse
and Georgetown since the fans have
rejoined Pitt's attack. But Auslander
seeks none of the credit.

“As far as me winning the games,
no. No way,” says Auslander
between swigs of hot tea with lemon;
he's nursing a sore throat. “The play-
ers definitely win the games. What

the crowd does is create a tremend- -

ous atmosphere that gives the play-
ers maybe a little more drive. The
crowd is very important in that

presenung

We’l1

respect, but the players-and coaches
deserve the credit for winning the
games, not me.”

“If I ’m addicted to cheer-
leading, and let's say I am;
and let is say that I like to do
it, which I obviously do,

addicted to that than to

alcohol or drugs.”

Z_ ,
in Oakland some ll years back and
watched intently as one of the
coaches put on such a good show
that he was invited to “perform” at
Fitzgerald Field House, Pitt has

enjoyed incredible support from the
bleachers. .

Auslander has maintained a firm
grip on the spotlight since his cheer-
leading debut in 1972, during which
Pitt crushed Rutgersby 30 points.
But he has hardly lived the life of a
celebrity. He spent the greater part
of the l970’s as a‘ Press paperboy
delivering papers to 150 homes in
the Highland Park area. Last year,
he posted baseball scores onto a
large scoreboard for the benefit of
the gamblers at the El Cortez Hotel

Pt:-.=..;ently, Auslander looks for-
ward his upcoming dinner show at
the Holiday House in Monroeville
on March 18. He will appear with
singer Susan Rose and will sing,

dance and share anecdotes from his-'
A illustrious career. He will also lead

cheers.

“People aren't coming there to
hear me sing,” says Auslander.
“They want to see me be funny. The-
re’ll be some good gambling stories,

some stories about Cas Myslinski

and reallysome hilarious things.

' “I’ll give you one story,” he adds.
“In I965, when I was working for the
post office and there was a chance I
might be drafted into the army, one

of the . supervisors, at the post
office—he used to call me Aussie-

some money, and that isn't even
guaranteed, according to Aus-
lander. “I think it will surprise peo-
ple that probably think that I would
not have the intelligence to come up,
and do something like this. I think
that most people think that when I
go out and cheer that I’m just a wild
maniac who really isn't, you know,
that intelligent."

“The people at the games aren’t

I the ones who feel that way,” he con-

tinues. “I think the students sort of
look upon me as, you know, I've“
been doing this for so long and its
like a tradition.

“But I think that adults who see
me do that, and they see a'40-year-
old man out there like that, they
start to question that person's
intelligence.” ' . '

One must admit that running
across Fitzgerald Field House in a
three-piece suit and tennis shoes,
eventually stripping down to his T-

shirt, isn’t the best way for Aus- .

lander to exhibit his intelligence, but
he puts it allsin perspective. .

“If I'm addicted to cheerleading,
and let's say I am; and let's say that I

like to do it, which I obviously do, 54

you know, I’d rather be addicted to
that than to alcohol or drugs. I
mean, this .isn’t the worst thing in the
world to be hooked on.”

f"HurdIes T 0 Clear

By DALE Moons

In life, when a hurdle crops up, a
person must concentrate on clearing
it and going to the next one. With
each hurdle cleared, he gains confi-
dence and a feeling of pride in hav-
ing accomplished-something, where
someone elsemay have stumbled or
not even tried.-

Life is not that much different for

O 1 Lady Panther Marsha Hawkins,

except she goes out ‘of her way to
find hurdles to clear. ‘

Hawkins, a freshman from Over-
brook High School in Philadelphia,
placed third in the 1 I0-meter hurdles‘
and was a member of the mile relay
team that also placed third in the
Pennsylvania Interscholastic
Athletic Association State Cha_m-

' pionships when she was only a jun-
I ior. Unfortunately, a long school
strike during her senior year hin- ‘

dered her progress.

When she arrived at Pitt last fall,
Hawkins wasn’t thinking about run-
ning track. The chemistry major

},believed her studies would take up

all of her time. But she found out she
was wrong.

‘‘I was used to practicing from" '

around 3 to about 5 [in the after-

_ noon],” Hawkins said. “When I got

here, I didn’t have to study then, sol
slept.”

After two or three weeks of this
routine, Hawkins decided it was
time to return to competition. She
was welcomed by Coach Elbert
Kennedy, who had no hurdlers on
his squad. _

To Hawkins, the hurdles are
something special. They represent a
status symbol, something that sets
her apart from the rest of , the

. competition.

“Anyone can run around the
track. Maybe they can’t run as fast
as someone, but they can run around

the track,” Hawkins said. “Not ev-I

erybody can come out and run the
hurdles, though. They look up to
you because you can run the
hurdles." ‘

continued from page twenty
Joyner will run, and in the 400-meter
run, Baderinwa will compete. Pol-
lock is entered in the 500-meter run.

Gallagher, Geary and Bill Moor-
head are scheduled for the 800-meter
run while Garland Brown, Todd
Colas and Pat Moran will compete
in the I000-meter run.

Mickey Rihtarchik, Moorhead
and Colas are scheduled for the
1,500-meter run--, and John Hutchin-
son, Don DiBenedetto and Tom
Bailey are entered in the 3000-meter
run.

‘The Panthers also have a 1600-
meter relay team entered. The team
consists of Baderinwa, Asberry, Pol-
lock and*Geary.

In the field events, McCall will
compete in the longjump and King-
dom in the high jump.

Mitton and Rob Goldberg are
entered in the triple jump. The pole
vaulting ' will be done by Rod
Cobany, and Bob Buczkowski will

_ do the shot putting.

With the IC4A and NCAA cham-
pionshi_ps following the West Vir-
ginia tnp, the Panthers cannot waste
this last opportunity to prepare for
these meets. Although it will be
more difficult to get mentally pre-

 pared due to the drop in competi-

tion, the Panthers must take this
weekend seriously.

TRACK NOTES: Entering the
meet this weekend, the Panthers
have qualified 25 competitors in 11
different events for the IC4A meet
and six runners in three events~for
the NCAA meet.

Practice is the key to success in the 0 ‘ ’ ‘ 0

hurdles, as small movements or \ '

between getting over the hurdle or ' '

going through it. There are times l  “   ""' '

when it seems that success will never

“When I started hurdling in high
