Five SO Seats field Uniconstitutionallypp

Maher Says
Election 

Invalid A

B)’ LEN BAKER

Five representatives to Student
Congress are holding seats as the
result of an invalid election, it
was disclosed at last Monday's
meeting.

Ray Maher, one of the five,
dropped the political bombshell,
when he announced that the Phar-
macy School had unconstitutionally
voted in last springls election.

The Constitution of Student Con-
gress does not permit the Pharmacy
School to elect representatives to
Congress.

The announcement grew from a
petition by the Pharmacy School,
through Dario Icardi, Men's Council
representative to Congress, asking
that a representative from the
school be allowed to attend Con-
gress’ meetings.

Already Represented

Don Ewart, Student Congress
member, pointed out that since the
pharmacists voted at the last elec-
tion they are represented in Con-
gress as much as any other student‘.

To allow’ them_a special repre-
sentative would be to ‘over repre-
sent’ them, he said.

Theodore W.Biddle, dean of men,
added to Maher’s statement. ‘Offi-
cially, their (the Pharmacy School)
students may not vote,’ he said.

The Pharmacy School has 420
members.

Maher Wilholds Information

Maher later told the News that
he was aware ofthe unconstitutional

been used sparingly in ‘the last two games because. of injuries, will

Knox Replaces Cecconi
In Student Congress  

Carlton Knox was elected by Student Congress at Monday's meeting
to fill the senior place vacated by Lou Cecconi’s resignation.

State Plans
Auto Caravan

Penn Staters will have the forces
of law and order on their side for
the Pitt-State clash neitsweek.

According to the Daily ‘Collegian,
State's campus newspaper, a state
police escort will be furnished to
lead the way to Pitt," provided more
than 50 cars make the trip.”

The Collegian also announced
that “student government represent-
atives are trying to arrange housing
facilities for Penn State students.”

This news came as somewhat of
a surprise to Flora Diemert, Stu-
dent Congress president. In fact it
was the first she had heard of any
such arrangements.

Miss Diemert said, "No student
representative on Congress has
been given official authority to
attempt to arrange housing facili-
ties.”

Howard Greenberger and Betty
Bolger, presidents of Men’s Council
and WSGA respectively, also denied
any knowledge of the announcement.

The information about the cara-
van and the housing facilities plan,
came ‘out in a meeting of the Penn
State National Student Association,
a body comparable to Student Con-
gress. , T A

 

Knox, who was nominated by
Don Wilde, ran against Budd Schul-
berg, nominated by Dick Kovar, and
Dick Cunningham, nominated by
Dick Campbell.

The first voting ended in a tie
between Knox and Schulberg. A
second vote was called and then
Knox took the lead.

In both votings President Flora
Diemert relinquished the chair to
Vice-president Bill Swanson so
she could cast a vote.

Howard Greenberger, in asking
for a point of information questioned
who would decide a tie vote if both
the president and vice-president
cast a ballot during the election.

Miss Diemert pointed out that
as an elected member of Congress,
she has the right to vote in internal
elections. .

Don Ewart, defending Miss Die-
ert’s stand, added that an election
is not similar to a vote on a motion
and every elected member of Con-
gress should have a ballot.

Knox was the victorious candi-
date of the majority bloc in Con-
gress. Schulberg was the defeated
nominee of the minority element in
Congress.

This is not the first political win-
ning for Knox this semester.  few
weeks ago he was elected by Men’s
Council to fill the resigned posi-
tion of Bob Kauffman.

New News Policy
Offers Solution to

Old News Problem


Starting with Tuesday's edition
of the News, a new policy will be
inaguarated. Aimed at getting all
of the campus organization bullet-
ins in the News, a news box has
been placed at the Student Desk.
Special announcement forms will
be placed at the Desk for groups
to write in their announcements.
These forms are then to be placed
in the box. The announcements
will appear in the next issue of
the News in the Bulletin Box. The
box will be at the Student Desk
Monday, Nov. 14.

Gophers Peril Panther

Ambitions Tomorrow   

By DAVE POLLOCK r
They’ll be playing with gold chips when Minnesota and Pitt '

clash at the Stadium tomorrow. A defeat to either team can mean’ i
the difference between sitting at home ‘on New Year’s Day or

playing in one of the bowl games that pays off in dollars

prestige. .

and‘

The Panthers are still in the running for a bid to the Cotton
Bowl in Dallas, Texas, according to reliable sources close to the,“

Pitt athletic scene.

Although Frank Carver, graduate manager of athletics, has
said that Pitt has received no bowl bids, it is still very probable
that no team, outside of Oklahoma, looms as a more attractive
choice to the Cotton Bowl committee. And Oklahoma islikely to

choose the Sugar Bdwl.

The Sugar Bowl pays less money than the Cotton Bowl, but

Oklahoma, backed by rich oil men,
has little need for the extra wamp-
um. -
Bright Lights Beckon

The bright lights ofNewOrleans,
where the Sugar Bowl is played,
seem more attractive than Dallas
to the Sooners. In fact, Oklahoma
chose to play there last year.

The winner of the Southwestern
Conference automatically becomes
the home team in the Cotton Bowl.
Rice Institute is the present leader.

The Gophers are in the same
boat at the Panthers. It is possible
that they may finish in a tie for the
Big Ten championship. If that hap-
pens, a vote must be taken to
decide which team will receive the
Rose Bowl bid. A defeat by Pitt
could ruin Minnesota's chances of
getting the vote.

Underdogs Again

Once again the Jungle Cats will
be underdogs before an expected
crowd of 45,000 fans.

Minnesota is slated as 14 point
favorites to hand the Panthers their
sixth straight loss in a series that
began in 1933.

Whether Pitt can come back after
losing a toughy to Ohio State de-
pends on what the ‘Panthers’ pony
backfield can do against the mam-
Minnesota line.

Nasty Team

Most of the Minnesota offense
centers around two fleet tailbacks,
Bill Eye and Dick Gregory.

After winning their first four
games, the Gophers dropped the
next two to Michigan and Purdue.

But Minnesota proved it is still
a nasty football team by thumping
Iowa, 55-7, last week, and it all
adds up to a real ball game tomorrow.

 

Band Plans   W  
Panther °°Day”‘  

The
Varsity Marching Band invites the
spectators at the Minnesota game

to spend 'FADay with the Panther”, 

during the half-time.

The Panther’s day begins as ,
any normal day should; with a sun-
rise. The music for this formation
is "The World is Waiting for the,
Sunrise.” For breakfast, the band
forms a large coffee pot and plays

“The Coffee Song.”  

The Panther then catches a trol-
ley for school to the tune of “The
Trolley Song”while the band forms
a street car.

Since he attends his first class

with a shmoe, the formation will
be a““shmoe. For this,the band will _
play and whistle, "Whistle
You Work.” L 

For the next number, "Tea for
Two," the band will form T 4 2.,
Finally the band forms a clock, to,

the music of "When Day is Done?’ A if

and finishes with the Alma Mater.

The half-time has been extended “-
about 5 minutes to permit the pre-

sentation of a pre-flight driﬁ teamyyt 

composed of 57 Naval Aviation!
Cadets and Midshipmen from’ the

Naval Pre-flight school at Pensa-i v_ if

Council Cuts Men ’s Point System

A point scale system for the men
was pushed out of the immediate
picture by Men's Council at their
meeting last Tuesday.

They voted “thumbs down" ona
motion which would have set up a
committee to investigate a point
scale system.

Such a system would place dif-
ferent amounts of points on various
school activities and limit the num-
ber of points that a student's acti-
vities can add up to.

This means, in effect, that if a

student under the point scale sys-.

tem had too many activities, he
would automatically have to drop
‘some until his points weren’t in
excess.

The women have a comparable

/
./

 

system in effect now. There was
one working for the men until the
early years of the war.

The main purpose as explained
by Council President Howard Green-
berger is to “spread jobs over more
students.”

E. J. McIntosh, assistant to the
dean of men and faculty advisor to
Council, stressed that the plan
would be "more advisory than
regulatory to the student who can't
say no.”

Roy Nelson, newly-elected Coun-
cil member, challenged the plan
as hampering an individual's free-
dom. "If I want-to take on a million
activities and flunk, that's my
privilege,” he said.

Dozia Frazier, Council’s vice-

president, remarked that after talk-
ing with student organization lead- I
ers and faculty advisors to student.
groups, he didn't believe that with
a point scale system there would
be enough interested students to
handle the may jobs on campus.
Roy Nelson, speaking again,
pointed out that when a student

able todecide for himself how many
jobs he can handle.

It was also pointed out at the
meeting that most of the students-
who hold campus positions don’t
hold tlmt many offices to be af-,,
fected by the plan. In view of all
the work that instituting such 8.
plan would entail, Council didn't
believe it was worthwhile- r

Still They Resign

.The power of suggestion apparently isn’t all it’s cracked up

A ulpvtobe. i

A month ago we took a slap at the march of student resigna-
tion notices across the pages of the News during the last year or
so. We pointed out that these came as the men and women legis-
lators either belatedly discovered themselves with too much to
handle or were involved in a bit of political manuevering. This
latter charge we've verified from «reliable sources to silence the

howls that, we were off base from the persons in question.
Nonetheless, our primary reason for mentioning it at all was

our calculation that, by putting the resignees in a critical public
eye, they might be a little bashful about giving up in the future

r posts to which they were duly elected.

It didn’t work. Since that first editorial three more legislators

--- Don Murray and Lou Cec-coni of Student Congress and Bob
{auffman of Men's Council -- have thrown in the sponge and opened
their positions to internal elections. All threeiexcused themselves
on grounds of inadequate time to perform their office properly. In
these particular instances, the reasons appear valid.

The two Congress resignations, however, did deprive the pre-
dominantly independent student body of unaffiliated representation.
Cecconi’s name carried him on the crest of last spring ’s voting
tide. But, realizing his crowded schedule of schooling and sports

iwould not likely permit him to participate adequately in Congress,
it seems to us he might better have turned down the nomination.

The political arena should be limited to those who aim to be
actively and professionally interested in politics.

Maybe, though, our aim was slightly misdirected. Maybe it’s
‘best that dead wood be cleared from the scene.

Let's hope, then, that, when and if (a pretty conclusive "if”)
this spring’s slates are drawn up, the proposed candidates use a
little judgment and foresight. For, that way, the legislative houses
will be a complete group of representatives elected directly by
the students, their constituents. When a series of internal elec-
tions become necessary, the theory that the bodies are comprised
of the selections "of the people” is weakened.

Suppose we give "sug-gestion” another chance.

Outdone it

Hang your heads, Pitt student body. Ohio State has shown you
up. For last Saturday's game at Pitt Stadium, a special excur-
sion train, packed with some 400 Buckeye rooters, chugged into
Pennsylvania station. I

Conversely, you’ll recall the failure experienced here by Stu-

I dent Congress and the Pittsburgh Sun-Telegraph to muster enough
Panther followers to send a similar train in the direction of Phila-
idelphia the previous week.

” Can it be that the solid backing thought behind the Panthers
this fall is not as strong as_ we figured? It seems, at least, that
the OSU outfit gets better support.

One of the hardest working, but
least appreciated groups in‘ the Uni-
versity is the Owl staff. For an
entire year, including vacations,
staff members plan layout-s,identify
pictures, and do the counrlesslittle
jobs that go into the publication of
a yearbook.

In spite of the fact that the 1949
book was judged one of the top in
the country, only about 10 per cent
of the students in the University
bought it.

We found that price is a big fac-
tor when/it comes to selling year-
books, but some people have other
reasons for not buying the Owl:

Lee Stevenson, College ’50: "I
used the money that my father gave
me to buy an Owl to get a book I
needed for class and I don’t want
to ask him for any more.”

Harry Renton, Engineering ’51:
“I don’t want one.”

Audrey Lane, College '53: “I
didn’t even knowanything about it.”

Bud Ray, College '51: “The last
one was lousy.”

Jean Striegel, College ’52:_‘”It’s
too early in the year. I haven’r
thought about it because the Owl
doesn't come out until June.”

Jim Leder, College ’S3: “I’ll be
-here long enough to buy one later.”

Martha Yost, Bus Ad. '51: "I
won't have five dollars until_I’m a
senior.”

Linda Loistrom, College ’53:
"What's the sense of buying it? I
don’t know enough people to recog-
nize the pictures.’? .

Mary McParland, College
“My sister bought one.”

Don Reed, College "50: "I can’t
afford to pay five dollars for a year-
book.I need a fifth of whiskey more
so I can lead cheers atthe football
game like I’-did last week.”

'52:

Eleanore Kuban, Bus Ad. 51:
"I just di"dn’t get around to it yet.”

Alex Mcltae, College '53: "I’m
working my way through and run-
ning pretty close onthe budget. I'll
buy one later.”

The “Filthy Five” are in danger of being reduced to the
“Terrible Two,"” but there’s doubt as to whether they played it‘

Ray Maher, IF Council president, and nominal leader of the
Five, admittedly knew of the error in last spring’s elections when

 
    

the Pharmacy school’s vote was
counted towards eight Congress-
ional seats. (See page 1) So did
President Flora Diemert, who did
the major part of the investigation
of fradulent voting claimed by the

Independent organization at the
time.
Miss Diemert asserts that she

was under the impression that stu-
dents in the Pharmacy school, whose
voting in the election has been

_judged invalid, were enrolled under

the College, and as such were en-
titled to vote. Maher, last year's
I ' 1 '

power behind the throne in campus
politics, and who has since crept

out from that vantage point, makes

no such excuse. -

The diminutive, bespectacled IF
president and Congress member has
been reported as saying, "I would
have called for a re-election earlier
in the year if Iwerre certain of being
seated again.” However, it is this
columnist’s belief that Maher was
speaking more in jest than any-
thing else.

Questioned why he had remained
silent despite his knowledge of
the invalidity of‘ the elections,
Maher shrugged, grinned, and re-
plied, “I was waiting for the psych-
ological moment “to spring it.”

It is no secret in eighth floor
circles that the Filthy Five, more

or less managed by Maher, is wag-

ing war to the hilt to gain control
of student government affairs. So
far, their attempts have been thwart-
ed, at least in Congress, by an
equally tight bloc who are just as
determined to hang on to the reins
of government.

Now, by virtue of the ineligible
votes cast_by the pharmacists last
year, Maher and his cohorts face
the possibility of having to cam-
paignfor re-election along with
Dick Campbell and Bob McKowen,

Dear Madam President:

Finding it impossible to do a
good job on the football field and
also as a member of Student Con-
gress, I have decided to submit my
resignation in hopes of not retard-
ing the fine work Student Congress
does.

I've enjoyed the short stay as a

member of Student Congress, and I

     

all the pledges of the various fra-

Letters to the Editor  

want to thank you for your patience
and support. A

I’m sure that you all understand

cision, but if I can ever be of any
assistance to Student Congress
please do not hesitate to call upon

I should also like to take this
opportunity to thank my many friends
for their confidence in me. I am
sincerely sorry that circumstances

office.

Respectfully yours

also elected last spring. Should
Congress decide that a new elec-
tion is called for (and the conserv-
ative majority might be so inclined)
here’s what could happen:

Maher, Cleland, and Swanson
might be defeated, either as a group
or one or two of_ them separately.
They would necessarily have to be
defeated by comparative dark horses,
since just about all the top male
aspirants are either on
Congress or have other positions
with which they are satisfied.

I can’t help feel, however, that
Maher is just as strong if not
stronger, as he was-last spring, and
his running mates would be backed
by the same group behind Maher.

‘Therefore, the possibility of any of

the three being ousted is actually
fairly slim.

What seems more likely is that
Campbell or McKowen, regarded as
being aligned with the conservatives
by the Five, would be defeatedby
the IF faction, which Maher has man-
aged to control fairly tightly.

In that casé, the Five could con-
trol at least eight votes, counting
Secretary Cora Pancereve, of the
eighteen in‘Congress, forcing the
conservatives to muster their full
strength for each meeting.

Under these circumstances, the
deadlocks and bitter debates which
have marked Congress meetings
this year would be trifling by com-
parison, and resulting decisions
and policies could have a decidedly
different complexion.

What remains now is to see whether
either faction is willing to risk los-
ing the seats they have now on a
gamble for more seats.\From this
angle, it looks as if the odds are
all in favor of Maher and his buddies.
Anyway, next week’s meeting ought
to be something to watch.

if not better, when they present

‘Caste’, a 19th century comedy
by Tom Robertson, was last per-

 formed in 1929 at the Old Vic, Lon-
if don. The Players chose this partic-

ular play in order to acquaint the
student body with a period produc-
tion. It is a romantic comedy of
customs and manners.

that draws guffaws from the and-

information on _planning school pro-
grams among its activities, has
been trying industriously to enroll
Pitt on its roster. ,
At the previous Monday’s meeting
arepresentative of NSA was present
to answer questions and to ask why
Pitt had not taken action on the
subject.

Before voting on the organization
Congress heard some bitter denunci-
ation of it.

Dave Cleland remarked that the
NSA needs Pitt, including Pitt’s
dues. At this point it was intro-
duced that although the dues run
over $300, with all the expenses of
sending representatives to the vari-
ous conferences, the total budget
would easily run up to $1000.

 

Congress pointed out that no
specific answers had been given to
their queries on how activities be-
tween various student groups are
coordinated.

1-‘at Leix informed Congress that
she had sent four letters to NSA
which have not been answeredyet.
One, said Miss McCauley, was a
special delivery-air mail.

Congress President Flora Diem-
ert said she felt the NSA was "try-
ing to enlist Pitt because if Pitt
joined the organization, then the
other colleges in the district would
follow.”

Don Ewart pointed out that Pitt
in the past has corresponded with
many other schools at a nominal
cost about activities. He thought
that Congress could carry this on
without joining NSA.

"A glorified postal system" is
what Ewart finally called the NSA.
He said it was "something like the



Purchase Plan Tabledlndefiﬁitely  

He then proposed the amendment
which tabled it indefinitely. It was
passed by a voice vote.-

The heat of the NSA battle was
partly held over from the discussion
on the possibility of holding dances
in the Commons Room.

Mrs. Patricia Shields, assistant
to the dean of women and advisor
to Student Congress, explained that
when money was originally solicited
for the building of the university,
the donors were given a clear im-
pression of what use the Commons
Room would be put to. Dances
wasn’t one of them.

As to the possibility of dances
this year, she said to “suddenly go
at it in a way of defiance is wrong.”

Ex-Grid Prospect and Gravedigger
Heads Panther Football Managers

83' DAVE POLLOCK

From gravedigger in the summer
to head football manager in the fall
——- that’s the story of Joe Perkovich.

Perkovich, who spends his vaca-
tion in the summer working in the
Beth-Shalom Cemetary, has been
a football manager since the spring
of his freshman year.

Now a senior, he was selected
as head undergraduate football
manager for this fall.

Except for a leg injury, Joe could
very easily have been a top foot-
ball star himself.

had Scholarship

The lean six footer came to Pitt
in the fall of 1946 on a football
scholarship. Everything went along
fine for Joe during his first autumn
on the campus, but during spring
grid practice he hurt his leg and
was forced to give up football.
He’s been a manager ever since.

At Etna High School, Perkovich
was a triple-threat halfback. Be-
sides doing most of_the running,
passing, and kicking, he called
the plays and was captain in his
senior year.

Was Hoop Star

Also a basketball player, Joe
set up the plays from his guard
position and helped pace his team
to the Class B Championship in
1945. ‘

An A student in high school,
Perkovich was president of his
senior class, elected to the Na-
tional Honor Society, and ranked
third in a graduating class of 105.

"My biggest ambition when I got
out of high school was to go to
Annapolis,” says Joe. "I _took an
examination with a group of fellows
who had gone to military schools,
but I couldn’t quite make the grade.”

Right Hand Man

Perkovich acts as a sort of first
lieutenant to Mike Milligan in his
job. as manager.

At away games he checks the
players to bed, onto buses and
trains, sees that they eat on time,
guards the water they take on all
trips with his very life, and sees
each player has a delicious apple
to chew ‘on before they go to bed.

Though he might be considered
a very successful young man, Joe
met with defeat one evening last

fall.

Ann of the Law

After the upset of Penn State
last year, Perkovich and five‘of
his buddies decided to go to State
College and bring home the Nittany
goal posts.

On arriving at Penn State and

 
     

. qudgum‘  K333  I
no ﬁﬂarese-V __

 

 

yanking on the goal posts for about
ten minutes, Joe and his friends
were interrupted by the police.

Running for the car, where a
fellow compatriot had the .motor
running, Perkovich met an unpleas-
ant surprise.

Puffing up to the car and seeing
the driver talking to someone out
the side window, Joe shouted,
"Let’s get out of here. The cops
are after us.”

The driver turned to Joe and
answered, “You’re telling me? What
the hell do you think this is on the
running board?”

Outstanding Passer
Those who have seen Perkovich
throwia football swear that he can

throw farther and more accurate than
any back on the Pitt squad.

And Joe claims that he can out-
run any member of the squad ex-
cept Jimmy Joe Robinson. But you’ll
never get any of the Panthers to
admit this.

“No Comment”
On Pitt Entry
Into Conference

According to the Boston Univer-
sity News, Pitt and seven othel
eastern schools are planning the
formation of a “Northeastem in-
tercollegiate Conference.” How-
ever, Frank Carver, graduate man-
ager of athletics here at Pitt, has
“no comment” to make on the
matter.

The Boston paper named the
potential members to be Boston
University, Penn State, Syracuse,
Colgate, Temple, New York Uni-
versity, and Maryland.

It does not seem likely, how-
ever, that Pitt would join such a
conference. The Panthers are
pretty well booked for the next
three years with midwestem
schools and such southern insti-
tutions as Duke, Rice, and Miami
of Florida.

The purpose of the conference
allegedly would be to bring the
colleges together in both football
and minor sports such as swimming,
fencing, boxing, wrestling, soccer,
and hockey. ‘

PiKA ‘Downs
Phi Kappa

Al Locknicar lead the PiKA’s to
a 13-0 victory over the Phi Kaps
at Schenley Oval Tuesday. PiKA
took the lead in the second quarter

when Locknicar passed to Carl
Rreuk in the end zone.
P hi K ap s’ Tippy Gentille’s

usually fine passing was of no avail
as the PiKA defenders batted down
several touchdown-bound passes.

The game went into the last per-
iod with the PiKA’s dut front, 6-0.
The Kaps threatened to even it up
when Tom Bruecken grabbed a
screen pass and sprinted to the ten
where a stout PiKA defense pre-
vented the score.

,The play that cinched the game
for the PiKA’s occured when Don
Osbone flipped a long pass to Lock-
nicar who ran it over.

Surnpter’s performance in the 1947,
contest which the Panthers lost,
29-0. A
Tough Assignments

In that game, the
Sumpter had the misfortune, so it
seemed before the opening kickoff,
of being Pitt’s starting right guard.
As such, he was pitted against
Minnesota’s Leo Nomellini, .246
pounds of All-American guard ma-
terial.

As it turned out the dwarfed
Sumpter, a stout-hearted sophomore,
made his presence known and felt
among Minnesota’s giant linemen.
To say that Sumpter’s seeminglv ill
fortune turned to good fortune would
be an understatement. The Clairton
Clutcher turned in a performance
that was praised by everyone.

Yogi Stuff

By MYRON KOPELIIAN
sports Editor

 

It has become increasingly evident during the past few weeks that a
gap is growing between yourselves and our department. Since the fate of
the sports pages is in your hands from the minute you and your machines

start to transform our stories into
printed matter, I am addressing a
few remarks to you in an effort to
smooth the situation.

As I understand it, you are dis-
contented because of our football
forecast chart which appears every

wisdom displayed by the yogis
hardly merits your going to the
trouble of readjusting your sensi-_
tive machines to set up a chart
form.
Quite Essential

But as a matter of fact, ladies,
the yogi chart is quite essential to
the happiness of' the readers. You

sons turn to our page solely for
the pleasure of scanning the foot-

ing: “What damn fools those guys
are."

The current season has been
somewhat annoying to us inasmuch
as the above comment has proved
more and more of a truism.However,
our discomfort is doubly the read-
er's enjoyment, and we aim to
please.

Mistakes, after all, are only
human. You make them, too.

Remember, Mary, the time our

    

'2

Don Murdock wrote that the jayvees
"were hoping to make winning a
habit?” You scarcely cemented
his relations with Coach Paul
Sager by printing that the jayvees
“Vere hoping to make wine‘a
habit.”
No Squabbles

Perhaps we wondered what you
had on your mind when you com-
mitted the error. But we did not
make an issue of the matter.

Sowhy not be equally cooperative

and bear with us for a few more

charts? I do not feel that every-
time I drop one into the box on
your desk,I should detect an under-
tone of grumbling and cackling.
However, let's let bygones be
bygones from here on in.

And Mr. Doerge, will you pass

;the dartboard so I can make my

selections for this week?

B3‘ STANLEY SKIBBOLL

Today is a big day for the un-
defeated Pitt football freshmen. A
win over a powerful Army plebe
team will make the season a suc-
cessful one for Coach Ted Schmitt
and his cohorts.

With only the West Virginia fresh-
men’ left on their schedule, the
Panthers have concentrated on their
one “big game.”

Lengthy practice sessions were
held at Ellsworth Field this week
in an effort to brush up on the weak
spots. Stressing his passing attack,
but concentrating in general on the
frosh offense, Schmitt had worked
the team hard in their three-day
practice.

Left by Bus

The Panther first year men board-
ed their Greyhound bus at 7:30
Thursday morning after a breakfast
in the Cathedral cafeteria.

After a 14-hour journey, their
first of the season, the frosh worked
off the effects of the travel with a
brief tune-up at the Cadet Field.

(Cont. from Page 5)

After the game, Nomellini singled
out Sumpter as the lineman of the
day. At the final whistel, he crushed
Sumpter’s hand in his oversized

mitt and boomed his congratula-
tions.
Dr. George Hauser, Minnesota

line coach, was just as impressed
by Sumpter’s line play as Nomellini.
He said that the Minnesota guards
should View motion pictures of the
game and learn how the guard posi-
tion was to be played. The leading
man in the flickers, of course,
would be Sumpter.

When asked about the 1947 game
this week, the modest Sumpter

grinned and begged off with, "I

don’t remember.”

Switch in Jobs

Sumpter is looking forward to
seeing Nomellini and the Gophers
again, though. But because he’s
playing left end now and the 6 foot
2 inch Nomellini is at the opposite
end of the line, Sumpter doesn’t
expect to come into contact with
Nomellini often. However, the 5
foot 10 inch pass clutcher from
Clairton expects to meet the giant
Minnesotan “a little.” As Sumpter
explained it, “How can I help but
meet him? He’s so big.”

Nomellini may be in for a sur-
prise before tomorrow’s ‘game is

Pollard comes from the same high

more.

, ,‘.‘Pop ” F inney Satisfied
   With Music «Ca reer

By BOB ROSSEL A ‘
M. ‘Finney, head of the music appreciation de-

partment and director of Heinz Chapel Choir, hasn’t made any
mistakes in a decade of music making and teaching at the Uni-
versity. However, he still remembers one misfake he made while
playing with the Minneapolis Symphony Orchestra in 1925.

"Pop,” as he is called by his
students, played a double forte,
when the score called for a rest.
The musician sitting next to him,
noticing his ‘embarassment, nudged
him and said, "Don’t worry, now

A - ‘the old man knows you’re playing.”

Dr. Finney came to the Univer-
sity in 1936, and two years later,
when Heinz Chapel was completed,
he organized the Chapel Choir.

Asked" if there were any high-

eiilights ‘in his career at Pitt, Dr.

Finney replied, "No, I can’t say
that there were, because I have en-
joyed everything I have done with
the music department.”

He graduated from the Univer-
sity of_ Minnesota in 1924 and later
studies at the Conservatoire Ameri-
'caine at Fountainbleau, France
and the Stern Conservatory in Ber-
e lin. ‘

That Dr. Finney should take up
teaching is easily understood. His
father was a professor of sociology
and a brother is a composer.

Writing textbooks also Comes

of his efforts "Hearing Music” is
