Extra extra: Pitt downs Duquse

Panthers need double—overtime to beat the Dukes

Alex Oltmanns
Staﬁ” Writer

The Pitt men’s basketball team
and Duquesne needed double
overtime to determine a winner
in the last college basketball
game in Mellon Arena history
6 last night. V

It was the first time.in City
Game history that the contest
lasted until double-overtime.

A After the two extra periods,
Pitt won its ninth straight City
Game; 67-58, giving it a 47-31
advantage all—time against the
Dukes.

“This one gave us bragging
rights,” Pitt guard Brad Wana-
maker said.

The Panthers (6-1) pulled
away in the second overtime be-
hind two Ashton Gibbs 3-point-
ers that broke the backs of the
Dukes (5-2). _

But it was Pitt’s resiliency and

defensive adjustments in the sec- V

0nd half that helped it come back

from a 33-20 halftime deﬁcit that

reached as highas 16 points early
_ in the second half. '

Duquesne came out hot in .

the ﬁrst half, going 6-of-11 from
3-point range in large part be-
cause of Bill Clark hitting four
of his six attempts from beyond
the arc. Pitt coach Jamie Dixon
knew his team had to counter-
act that, so he did something he
normally doesn’t like to do. He
switched to a 2-3 zone defense.‘

The zone made all the differ-
ence for Pitt as Duquesne ﬁn-
ished just 9-of-33 from three and

21-of—66 total from the ﬁeld.

“They made us look like a deer .

in the headlights,” Duquesne
coach Ron-Everhart said.
3 Gibbs agreed, saying, “Our
defense stepped up once we went
zone?

Gibbs’s play late in the game

- was pivotal for the Panthers,

even though he struggled with
his shot throughout regulation,
shooting just 1-of—1o for seven
points. . _

But he kept shooting when
the game was on the line and
finished with three 3-pointers
and 15 points.

“I just wanted to keep shoot-
ing,” Gibbs said. “I knew it would
fall sooner or later.”

The Panthers once again
out-rebounded their opponent,
something Dixon preaches. Pitt
beat the Dukes on the boards by
a count of 54-41.

This was primarily because
of the strong play of center Gary
McGhee and forward Nasir Rob-
inson.

McGhee ﬁnished with 11
points and eight rebounds, four
on the offensive side, and his
thunderous dunk with 3:04 left
in the second half brought the
Panthers half of Mellon Arena to
its feet and the Panthers within
one.

Robinson contributed 11
points and nine rebounds. He
was a major reason whyrPitt kept
it somewhat close in the first
half, coming out of the gates
with eight points in the open-
ing half. ..

Pitt got into the bonus early

Counoﬂ
puts off
tax   vote

, Lindsay Carroll
Assistant News Editor

City Council members assured stu-
dents they did not want to tax 1 per-
cent of their tuition, and they voted
yesterdayto postpone thevote on the
Fair Share Tax until next week.

What _Council President Doug
Shields called the “November sur-
prise” — since Mayor Luke Raven-
stahl proposed the tax after his re-
election — inspired high emotions in
Council members, who are currently
divided on the issue. .

The ensuing debate lasted more
thantwo hours, endingina7-2 vote on
a motion to delay voting on the tax.

Postponing the vote could allow
Council members to meet with repre-
sentatives from the city’s universities
in hopes of negotiating, as well as time

to search for other solutions, some

members argued. I
Shields and Councilman Bill Pedu—
to opposed waiting until next week
and voted against that motion. The
siuiation, which has already put the

‘universities and some state authorities -

on the defense, could “fester” and cre-
ate more “bad blood,” Shields said. 3

However, -Councilmen Bruce
Kraus, of the South Side, and Patrick
Dowd, ofLawrenceville, who continue
to voice their opposition to the tax,
voted to hold the vote.

“We don’t have votes to vote down
thisbill,” Dowd said. “Itwould be fool-
hardy of us to drive this vote.”

  UPMC boosts research on sexually transmitted infections

National Institutes of Health award UPMC a'$12.5 million grant to start center and study sexually transmitted infections

Julie Percha
Contributing Editor

When Arkansas native Toni Darville moved to
Pittsburgh two years ago, she was looking for
chlamydia.

She had studied the sexuallytransmitted dis-
ease for more than 12 years, most recently on
mice models at the University of Arkansas, and
was ready to move on to clinical trials.

Now Darville, the current chief of pediatric

infectious diseases at Children’s Hospital ofPit1s-
burgh ofUPMC, has her opportunity, thanksto a
$12.5 million grant from the National Institutes
of Health.

“There were already some greatpeople here
doing research on women’s health, so it was re-
ally attractive for me to come here and develop
collaboration,” Darville, the principal investiga-
tor, said. “The collaborative atmosphere at the
University of Pittsburgh is really what enabled
us to getthis grant.” A

Theﬁve—yeargrantwi]lhelp Darville andthree
colleagues establishthe UPMC Sexually 'I‘ransmit—
ted Infections (S'I‘I) Cooperative  Center,

infections. . .

The NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and
Infectious Diseases issued grants to fund four
to six similar STI research centers nationwide,
totaling $10.2 million in awards.

The. grant that UPMC’s center received will
fund four separate research initiatives, including
projects headed by Darville; Harold Wiesenfeld,
associate investigator at Mageewomens Research
Institute; Sharon Hillier, director of reproductive
infecﬁous disease research atMagee; andThomas
Cherpes, researcher at Magee.

One of the projects focuses on the treatment
ofpelvic inﬂammatory disease, or PID, abacterial

infectionintheupperfernalegenitaltractAccord- ’

ingto the Centers forDisease Control and Preven-
tion, more  1 million U.S. women experience
PID armuallyjcausing damage to their fallopian
tubes and ovarian tissue. The disease, which is
commonly caused by S'IIs such as chlamydia
and gonorrhea, is serious and can cause chronic
pelvic pain, ectopic pregnancies or infertility.
Another project aims to identify the types of
bacteria that cause bacterial vaginosis, a condi-

— tiontliatdisruptsthenornialbalanceofbacteria

inthevagina. The complication causes burning,
cervical discharge and contractions, which can
lead to premature births in pregnant women,
accordingto the CDC. ‘

“It’s very common — a lot more common
thanyou’d think,” Darville said.

- Thethirdresearch endeavorwill identify the
immune response that is most associated with
protection against chlamydia. This project will
additionally collaborate with Genocea Biosci-
ences, avaccine development company, to help
create avaccine for the STI. A ‘

‘ In additionto leadingthe S'I‘I research center,_
Darville also heads thefourth research projectto
be funded through tjne NIH grant. Her research
focuses on the role of receptor signaling with

' chlamydia, using a mouth model to simulate

pathogenesis.
TheCDCestimates thatchlamydiaisthe most

' commonbacteria1STI,withmorethan1.o3mil-
lioncasesreportedintheUnitedStatesin2006. _

The diseaseis often“silent,”with mild orabsent
symptoms —— including discharge, abdominal
pain or a burning sensation -—— that can surface
up to three weeks after exposure.

Both men and women can contract chla-.
mydia, but its effects are not equal between
genders. ‘

“Men basically spread the disease. Women
bear the brunt of it,” Darville said. She said that
men experience few longterm complications,
whereas women commonly have scarring on
their fallopian tubes, which leads to infertility.

The disease is easilytreatablewith antibiotics,
butforwomenwho don’tknowthey’re infected,
the effects can be long—lasting.

“Chlamydia is the leading cause of involun-
tary infertility in the worl ,” she said; “Ifyour
fallopian tubes are scarred, then there’s nothing
you can do.”

An estimated 10 percent of teenage girls,
ages 15-19, are infected with the disease, with
the most incidences of the disease occurring in
adolescence. A

Council 4 1

would have voted against the bill if they had to
vote yesterday. _

Dowd said he planned to “battle this as hard
as [he] can.”

“But it is ridiculous for us to sit here and per- i
sonalize this debate,” he said.

Council members Rev. Ricky Burgess, Tonya
Payne, Theresa Kail—Smith, Darlene Harris and
Jim Motznik voiced support for the taxin lieu of
another solution. Several of them raised con-
cerns about the possibility of cutting services
or jobs or raising property taxes to close the
city’s budget gap.

Underlying their concerns was the senti-
ment that nonproﬁt land—owners didn’t pay
their share to the city. As 501(c)(3)'tax-exempt
institutions, nonproﬁts in Pittsburgh, such as
Pitt and UPMC, pay limited property taxes.

This and other state restrictions make it hard
for the Council to ﬁnd ways to collect revenue
for the city, said Payne, who represents South
Oakland and Downtown. She urged the Council
to unify to combat the problem and “leave egos
at the door” with their opinions.

_ Harris, whose district includes Brighton
Heights and Troy Hill, said some residents, such
as senior citizens, can barely afford to pay their
property taxes. She said she doesn’t like paying
taxes herself, but she has to —— and that any
discussion of passing atax is difﬁcult. ‘

Harris said she didn’t want to tax students,
but would support it with no other options.

“Cutting [services] is not an option for the
safety of the residents and those that come here,”
she said.

But Shields, whose district includes Squirrel
Hill and Hazelwood, blasted the bill. He called
it a “national embarrassment to the city,” as the
mayor portrays students as people that don’t
pay their fair share.

The universities have “tremendous” influ-
ence at the state level, Shields said. He told the
Council members that ‘they were trying to ﬁght
aformidable opponent. -

“You don’t know whatyou’re doing,” Shields
said. “You’ve got the leverage of this pen trying,
to lift up a Mack truck.”

Other Council members argued that City
Council was an independent body and should
make decisionsas such.

Motznik, who represents neighborhoods like

‘ Carrick and Brookline, said though he’d rather

not favor a tax on students over a property tax
increase, students put up with fees and tuition
prices increasing at their universities. _
“I honestly think we might be doing [stu—
dents] afavor with this 1 percent tax,” Motznik
said. - .
Peduto reiterated points made by Shields,
saying that many people at the state level think
the tuition tax is an example of bad policy. He

delivered two letters from university leaders '

to the Council.

One was from Pittsburgh Council on Higher
Education President Mary Hines and the other
wasfrom Chancellor Mark Nordenberg. E

Nordenberg said in his letter, which he sent V

to Ravenstahl, that he.c0uldn’t speak for all the

area’s colleges, nonproﬁts and business organi-
zations, butthat he thoughttheirleaders“would
welcome the opportunity” to discuss alternatives
with the city. »

“As long as that proposal is being pursued,
all of our energies necessarily will be directed
toward defeating itand protectingourswdents,”
he wrote. .

affairs, did not say which alternatives the Univer-

said in an e-mail.

sympathy for the schools’ leaders.

“Who in their right mind would negotiate
with someone who has a gun to your head?”
Peduto asked the Council. “Especially when it’s
a bigger gun than your gtm?”

Prior to the debate, Motznik introduced
amendments to the tax legislation to address
some “minor technicalities.” .

However, after questioning a representative
from the city’s law department about the amend-
ment, Council members realized that not all

Downloading or sharing copyrighted music, movies, or games is illegal
and violates Pitt’s Student Code of Conduct, even if it's done by accident.
You could face stiff fines and other disciplinary actions, including
suspension and loss of University computing privileges, including e-mail

and Internet access. Don’t Do it.

'\

changes in the bill were clearly indicated.

Motznik said he no longer felt comfortable
addressing the amendment until those changes
were made obvious.

Shields said he asked the law department to
review possible exemptions to the amendment, ‘
such as veterans.

The representative said no speciﬁc exemp-
tions were requested, so the department didn’t
look into the issue. He also said that exemptions
were a special concern because of a uniformity

clause in the commonwealth’s constitution.

Shields said he thought many kinds of people
other than veterans might deserve exemptions
from the tax, including children emancipated
from their parents by the state, students who
are also on active military duty, police, ﬁremen,
people who are disabled and senior citizens.

“If sheer lunacy is goingto rule, Iwant some
people exempt from this,” Shields said.

Paul Supowitz, the University’s vice chancel-
lor of governmental relations, and other Pitt
officials came to the meeting.

City Council is scheduled to vote on the Fair
Share Tax next Wednesday at 10 a.m. at the

Editorial

  Opinions

West unjustifiably

paranoid

peak on Sunday when Swiss
voters passed a referendum
banning minarets. '

The ban would prohibit build-
ing new minarets —— Islamic prayer
towers — and it passed with 57.5
percent approval, according to
Reuters. In such a display of mis-
placed paranoia, Switzerland has
become an intolerant beacon amid
a Western Europe strugglingto
deal with an inﬂux of Muslim im-
migrants.

France is currently consider-
ing a ban on burqas and other face
veils. Two Austrian provinces al-

I slamophobia reached a new

ready prohibit minarets, and an

Italian political party has “paraded
pigs over mosque building sites
to desecrate them,” according to
Reuters. In 2006, the Netherlands
required potential immigrants
to watch a video that included
drug use, topless women and gay
men kissing. It was an attempt
to candidly prepare immigrants
for the liberal Dutch culture, but
many Muslims thought it was an
exclusionary tactic -- i.e. “Citi—
zens Wanted: No Muslims Need
Apply.”

Conversely, both France and
Denmark have approved plans
for massive mosque construction.
Clearly, Europeans are torn on how
to deal with Muslim immigrants.

In Switzerland, like other West-
ern European countries, some
Swiss natives fear that growing
numbers of Muslim immigrants
will refuse integration and even-
tually force Sharia law onto ‘non-
Muslims. Such an aggressive dem-
ocratic hijacking seems unlikely
in a country of 7.6 million people
where only about 4 percent are
Muslim — especially considering
that most Muslims do not support
Sharia law.

Saying Sharia law wholly rep-

resents Islam is like saying all '

Christians believe in living a lit-
eral interpretation of Leviticus —
chapter 20 verse 13 mandates the

of Islam

execution of homosexuals.

Western countries fear Mus-
lims because they wrongfully as-
sociate Islam with violence and
terrorism. Yes, terrorist attacks
continue worldwide, from New
York to Mumbai. Yes, manyqof
these attacks were orchestrated
by Islamic extremists. But lash-
ing out at Muslim prayer towers,
symbols of peaceful devotion, is
obsessive bigotry.

The Swiss referendum ‘gives

’ actual violent radicals fodder for

claims that Western countries are
anti-Islamic.

Regarding the integration of
Muslims, The United States has
not faced the same challenges\as
European countries. The United
States does not share the same
proximity, and only 0.4 percent
of the population identiﬁes ‘itself

as Muslim. '

Yet, this remains an important
lesson. American xenophobes al-
ready target Mexicans, fearing that
too many immigrants will turn
the national language to Spanish.
Imagine what they’ll say if Muslim
immigration spikes.

Even Ben Franklin, who dis-
liked German immigrants, once
asked, “Why should Pennsylvania,
founded by the English, become a
Colony of Aliens, who will shortly

- be so numerous as to Germanize us

instead of our Anglifying them and

‘ will never adopt our Language or

Customs, any more than they can
acquire our Complexion?”

More than 250 years later, that
quote seems absurd. First—genera—
tion immigrants might retain their

I traditional customs, but, if they’re

treated with equality and a modi-
cum of hospitality, each generation
after integrates increasingly into

- the larger community.

‘People. assimilate. Discrimi-

natory measures, like the Swiss

minaret ban, merely hinder that
progress.

Switzerland isn’t tearing down
towers, but it is building a wall.

and Germany, “never before in modern his— ~

tory have the gaps between great powers
been so wide.” Meanwhile,.China’s economy
is “extremely dependent on exports —— they
amount to around two -ﬁfths of China’s GDP
—— and hence vulnerable to global economic
downturns.”

Militarily, the United States has an annual
defense budget of around $600 billion. That
number is equal to 41 percent of the world’s
share. The next nine countries spent $476
billion combined. Even after adding the 27
European Union states’ combined budget
of $507 billion to that sum, the U.S. retains
military superiority.

In total amount of armed forces, the Unit-

. ed States ranks second, behind China, with

3,385,400 active and reserve forces.

Although China’s troops number.
7,024,000, their ability to swiftly-and ef-
fectively transport military power is severely
outmatched by the U.S. Navy. Earlierthis year,
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates wrote that
the Navy’s “battle ﬂeet is still larger than the
next 13 navies combined — and 11 of those
13 navies are U.S. allies or partners.”

' Furthermore, the Navy currently oper-
ates twice as manyaircraft carriers than
the all other countries combined. China,
meanwhile, will not have any functioning
aircraft carriers until 2015.

Even with the numbers, however,’analysts
must examine U.S.. power not in absolute
terms, but in terms relative to other coun-
tries. .

Throughout the past century, the United
States has stepped up when other nations .

would not or could not.

For the past two decades — essentially
since the end of the Cold War — the United
States has led the world in working to allevi-
ate crises and unify nations around collective .
objectives. Bosnia, the Mexican currency
crisis, the Oslo Accords and the coalitions
developed for military action in Afghani-
stan and Iraq all illustrate the primacy of.
the United States. T

When Americans voted on Nov. 4, 2008,
the world watched intently. No other country
on the planet i:ould draw such concern over
the results of one election. The rest of the
world understands that what happens to the
United States might affect them.

The United States is the most liberal de-
mocracy in world history. Americans em-
braced an ideology that triumphs over all
others because it is the greatest cultivator of
human development and progress.

As a result, the United States is a remark-
ably resilient country leading a globalized
world community. The United States has
countless allies dependent on its prosperity
and an even higher number of countries that
would shudder at the thought of China or
Russia as the world’s only superpower.

“Open all the borders on Earth,” Thomas '

Friedman wrote, “and see what happens. In
about half a day, the entire world would be a ‘
ghost town, and the United States would look
like one giant line to see ‘The Producers?”

i This remains true today. It’s hard to imag-
ine that tomorrow would be any different.

Letter to the editor

To the Editor, -

The only thing more dismaying about Giles Howard’s pitiable manifesto than the
fact that it was rewarded with five whole columns is the perverse logic of its ﬁnal
paragraph. Yes, indeed! Pity the poor college student. If only there was something
—— other than the franchise, a ready-made political lobby and social prestige '— to
protect his rights against the depredations (and funding?) of Big Government. If only
the self—hati»ng academic elite had not burdened us with such a dementedisense of guilt
that we cannot bear to spend the odd weekend keeping SABMiller profitable. If only
there was some heroic voice to shake us from our wayward concern for the multitude
of global woes our education might help lighten. ’

. No, pity instead the college student for having a “champion” like Howard, who does
not seem to appreciate the very real (and very important) liberties that many American
college students do have. Nor does his sense of liberty seem to extend far beyond tax
hatred. Where, indeed, was Howard’s keen sense of “liberty” when the forces of law
and order were quick with the tear gas and bracelets back in September? To argue, as
he does, that students should “abandon the old ethic of self—sacrifice” and ignore the
liberties of others (for instance, in Darfur, the liberty of not being hunted down; in
Palestine, the liberty of self—determination) is as irresponsible as it is myopic.

Rosi Golan Cl mix of folk, pop and TV shows»

Senior Staff Writer

Rosi Golan \
Club Café

'Dec.5,7p.m.

Most people have heard Rosi Go-
lan’s music, even if they haven’t heard
of her.

Her songs have been used in
“Grey’s Anatomy,” “One Tree Hill,”
“Dollhouse,” “Ghost Whisperer,”
“Private Practice” and “Brothers and
Sisters,” as well as several national ad
campaigns- ~

Golan’s music doesn’t stick to one
genre, justas it isn’t limited to one tele-
vision station. . A I

“It’s kind of a mix. Some stuff is a
little poppier, some is folksier. It’s tough
to deﬁne it. Ifyou needed to put it in

a category, I’d say it’s pop-folk with a
country twinge,” Golan said. “I don’t

liketobe stuffed into one genre. I’d get ,

kind ofbored if I were to put together
a record of all the same music. I think
you need diversity.”

When asked if she had evertiirned

onthe television or radio andbeen sur-
prised to hear one of her own songs,
Golan said, “Yeah! That actually has
happened. It’s weird, and it’s really
awesome. I’rn sothankﬁil. I’ve had such
anincredible year. People have been so
supportive ofwhatldo. [Music] is are-
ally diﬂicult business to do well in.”
She will perform at Club Café on
Dec. 5, a show she’s looking forward
to. “I really enjoy playing that venue,

and there was a great tima taco place
' nearby,” she said. V

Golan’s debut album, The Driﬁer
andtheGypsy, came outlastNovember
afterthe Israeli—bom singer spent sev-
eral years in the music business.

“For a long time, I could have re-
leasedaset of demos, butIfeltIwasn’t
really readyuntil lastyear. Itwas alon-
ger journey for me. I also started writ-
ingfor other artists and got caught up
in that,” Golan said.

The album’s title track deals with

I Golan’s childhood and herfather,who

passed away shortly before the record
was ﬁnished and to whom the album
is dedicated. I

“The song embodied where Iwas at
that time,” she said. “You write alot of

songs and then look at everythingyou
have and tiyto put together a journey.

- Whenyou’re puttingtheminacertain

orderyoutiyto create afeeling. I kind
of aim for an emotional arc,” Golan
said. 4

Golan did notbegin creating music
until shewas almost 20.

“I was kind of at that point where

Iwasjustlil<e,‘WhatamIdoingwith_

my life?’ I had always loved music, but
I didn’t know if I could sing. I heard a
commercial for a sale at Guitar Cen-
ter and bought one onawhim,” Golan
said.

"Senior day for first Wannstedt recruiting class

Kyle Craig
Senior Staﬁ’ Writer

“Senior Send-off

Saturday’s contest between No. 15
Pitt and No. 5 Cincinnatiwill have emo-
tional gravity for reasons beyond its Big
East championship implications.

Saturday will mark the last time
18 seniors take Heinz Field in Pitt uni-
forms. Out of those 18 players, 13 have
started in a game for the Panthers this
season.

This senior day will be especially
signiﬁcantforhead coach DaveWannst—

ﬁédt, because itwill markthe graduation
of players who committed to the Pan-
thers as members ofWannstedt’s ﬁrst
complete recruiting class.

“Most of these kids  came in as
freshmen duringthatﬁistfull recruit-
ingseasonthatwe had here wheniﬁrst
came to the University,” Warmstedt
said. “Ifsbeen reallyneat seeingthese
kidsgrowasyoungmenandalsobe-
come betterfootball players and build
this program up over the past four or
ﬁve years.”

P” Warmstedt noted  the “script”
cou1dn’tbepreparedanybetIerforSat-
urday’s game, especiallyforthe seniors
who want to go out on top. It would
be a ﬁtiing accomplishment for the
players who bought into Wannstedt’s
vision during the recruiting process

four years ago.

Ai’terst1ugglingduringWannstedt’s
ﬁrst few seasons, Pitt now has an op-
portunityto playinaBowl Champion-
ship Series game. Recent success has
transformed the expectations for the
football program.

“Our expectations and our players’
expectations have changed. Ayearago,
everyonewas doingbackﬂips, because
we won nine games, and rightfully so,
because it was the ﬁrst time in over a
quarter of a century,” Wannstedt said.
“Now we’re at nine games, and we’re
pressingfor more.” ,

Anassumed level of success isapart
of anytop-tierprogram, whichiswhat
Wannstedt hopes Pitt becomes under
his guidance. H

“Wefeellikewecangetmore [wins].
We want more, these kids want more,
thefans want more, and that’s all part
of winning,” Warmstedt said.

play their ﬁnal game at Heinz Field Saturday.

 

tatives from the Charlotte, N.C., bowl
are interested in inviting Rutgers (8-3)
as their Big East participant.

Pitt ﬁnds itselfon the short end of
allofthese bowl debates because ofthe
perception that the Panthers fan base
doesn’t travel in impressive numbers
to bowl games. Since bowl games are
businesses, the moneythat comes with
large, traveling groups of fans will al-
ways be favored. g

Ultimately, ifPittfailsto beat Cincin-
natii it could go from playingfora shot
ataBCS gametoacceptinganinvitation
from the Papajohnscom Bowl or the
St. Petersburg Bowl. Such a fall from
grace would take some of the shine off
a once—promising campaign.
Bringing Berry Back

According to Wannstedt, start-
ing cornerback Aaron Berry is ex-
pected to play in Saturday’s game
after missing the West Virginia con-
test because of a shoulder injury.

Berry practiced earlier in the
week and will help the Panthers
in their attempt to contain Cincin-
nati’s passing attack, which ranks
sixth in the nation.

The senior corner will have
his hands full while matching up
with the explosive Mardy Gilyard,
who leads all Big East wide receiv-
ers in receptions and touchdown
catches.

Pitt football alumni: Where are they now?

Check in on the status of LeSean McCoy, LaRod Stephens-Howling, Tyler‘Palko and other former Panthers_

Evan Burgos
Senior Staﬁ” Writer

LeSean McCoy, RB, Eagles — The
* rookie tailback started his second
consecutive game for the injured
Brian Westbrook, carrying the ball
17 times for 76 yards in addition to 25
yards receiving. McCoy also punched
inagame—tyingtwo-point conversion
.___attempt on a shovelpass with less
than eight minutes to go. The play led
to the Eagles kicking a game-winning
ﬁeld goal in its ﬁnal two minutes.

LaRod Stephens-Howling, RB, Car-
dinals — McCoy’s college backup
“had a career week doing it all in the
third, least heralded, phase of the
game — special teams. Stephens-
Howling recorded his second career

touchdown, returningakick 99 yards
for a score. He also chipped a pair of
special teams plays, downing the ball
inside the 5-yard line on two punts.

Antonio Bryant, WR, Buccaneers
— The wide out reeled in a 42-yard

touchdown snag in the second quar— '-

ter against the Atlanta Falcons. Bry-
ant ﬁnished the day with ateam—high
91 yards receiving. The score was his
third of the year butwasn’t enough to
hold off the Falcons, who prevailed
20-17.

Darrelle Revis, CB,Jets — Revis
sparked thejets on Sunday, taking a
pick 67 yards for a touchdown mid-
way through the ﬁrst quarter against
the erratic Carolina Panthers. Re-
vis, who is widely regarded as one
of the NFL’s top shutdown comers,

shut down Pro Bowl receiver Steve
Smith to one catch for 5 yards. He
also recorded two tackles. The Jets
won easily, 17-6, to improve to 5-6
on the year. '

Tyler Palko, QB, Steelers — The for-
mer Pitt quarterback was signed by
the Steelers last Wednesday to serve
as a backup to rookie Dennis Dixon,
who started Sunday’s game because
of injuries to both Ben Roethlisberger

Lady Panthers
defeat Youngstown

Jay Huerbin
Sports Editor

Kate Popovec and Selena Nwude
each had a double—double, as No.
19 Pitt overpowered Youngstown
State on its way to a 89-37 vic-
tory. It was the Panthers ﬁrst
road test of the season.

Popovec had 11 points and 12

rebounds for the Panthers, who
improved to 6-0 on the season.
Nwude ﬁnished the game with 10
points and 10 rebounds.
..._ Despite the blowout, scoring
wasn’t easy for either team early
in the game. The Panthers started
the game shooting 4—of—17, while
the Penguins converted on only
one of their first 18 attempts.
There was roughly a six-minute
period during which both teams
failed to score a point.

After a Youngstown State
3—pointer cut Pitt’s lead to 9-6,
the Panthers scored the next 15
points and never let up.

The Panthers never trailed
in the game and outmatched the
Penguins (O-7), coming down

‘ with 56 rebounds compared to

the Penguins’ 26.

But Popovec and Nwude
weren’t the only Panthers to light
up the scoreboard. Four other
Panthersiscored in the double
digits, including three players
from the bench. Sophronia Sal-
lard was the third starter to score
10 points. ' e

Corning off the bench,
Shawnice “Pepper” Wilson shot
6 for 6 from the ﬁeld and scored
13 points —- all in the second
half. Jania Sims and Shayla Scotti
scored 11 and 10 points, respec-
tively.

Freshmen Leeza Burdgess and
Ashlee Anderson were the only
two Panthers who did not see any
game action.

Pitt returns to the Petersen
Events Center on Saturday to host
Western Michigan (3-3). Tipoff
for the game is set for noon.

Pitt faces
free throw
problems

City Game.< 1

in the second half as Duquesne, which
was in foul trouble all night, racked up
10 fouls -quickly. The Dukes had three
players foul out, including Damian
Saunders, the nation’s seco_r1d—leading
rebounder and the team’s third lead-
ing scorer.

Yet the Panthers were not able to
fully capitalize onalloftheirtrips to the
free throw line, going 23—of—42 from
the line.

Pitt’s depth showed up once again
in the ﬁnal college basketball game
at Mellon Arena and seemed to wear
Duquesne down as the game went
along.

The Dukes had three players log46
minutes or more. Pitt had none.

Whﬂe it wasn’t pretty, and many
times it looked like Pitt was going to
fold under the pressure, it didn’t, and
that’s just another step for this young
team.

“I thought we put on a pretty good
show for the last game of the arena,”
Dixon said.
