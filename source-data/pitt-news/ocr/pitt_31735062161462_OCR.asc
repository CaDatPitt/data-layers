Elimination of Overload

In Line with Senate

DICK KOVAR
Editor

(See Editorial "Doubt

Dispeﬂed." Page 4)

Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald’s plan to eliminate over-

load teaching at the University

is directly in line with a reso-

lution passed last year by the University Senate, it was learn-

ed‘ yesterday.

Interviewed by The Pitt News, Dr. Fitzgerald read a joint
report of the Senate Budget Policies and Educational Policies
Committees which called for reduction and eventual elimina-
tion of overload over a three-year period with corresponding

pay raises.

The report and resolution was passed almost unanimously

by the Senate in February 1950
ruary.

, and was reafﬁrmed last Feb-

“OverIoad Should Go”

The report asserted that,

while overload teaching was

necessary immediately after the’
war when teachers were few and
enrollment was high, that situa-
tion no longer existed.

“Now that teachers are availa-
ble, overload should go,” it read,
and called for early action on its
recommendation.

The Chancellor’s plan calls for
a 10 per cent pay increase-next
fall. It is hoped that such an in-
crease which would amount to
$432,000, will come from increas-
ed state appropriations.

Deﬁcit Budget Asked

Failing that, “the Board of
Trustees may have to approve a
budget carrying a substantial def-
icit,” the administrator warned.

This policy would carry the
University through the next two
“low years,” he believes, when
returning draftees and larger high
school graduating classes will help
bring the enrollment back to
normal.

The Chancellor’s plan, contain-
ed in an administrative directive
to deans and some department
heads, called for:

1. Elimination of overload
teaching.

2. Elimination of many
full- and part-time lecturers
next fall, based on enrollment
ﬁgures.

3. Reduction in number of
small classes.

4. Elimination of a small

number of graduate assist-

ants.

In addition, it asked the deans
to hold the line on present salar-
ies, but promised “every effort” to
approve a 10 per cent raise next
fall.

$285,000 Needed

This year’s budget provided
$147,000 for overtime teaching.
Elimination of this expenditure
and substitution of the 10 per cent
raise would add $285,000 to the
1951-52 budget, already curtailed
due to predicted enrollment drops.

Science Is No Enemy toM_an,’
Physics Head Halliday

3! JOAN LISOTTO

ays:

~ Staﬁ‘ Reporter

“Science is neither friend nor foe ,to* humanity.”

So said Dr. David Halliday, head of the physics de-
tment since last fall, in a recent interview.

He feels that the blame

ould not. rightfully fall on the‘

ders of Science.
“Those people who consider sci-
an enemy are ignoring the
dent beneﬁcial contributions

Physics Head

und them, such as telephones,
levision, electricity, and, most
portant, the development of
ccessful disease combatants,”
id Dr. Halliday.
Scientiﬁc evolution was and is
_ inevitable as birth and death,
‘explained, mainly because of
se dominant trait in man, cur-
. ty. ‘
‘Most inventions stemmed from
‘ ces completely irrelevant to

for pressing world problems

the ﬁnished product, he contin-
ued.
No Diabolieal Intentions

“The atomic bomb, for instance,
was developed during an experi-
ment on uranium ﬁssion. There

were no \ evil intentions, no de- .

structive thoughts among the lab
workers. It was merely an experi-
ment of the type which" is con-
ducted in college labs all over the
country,” Dr. Halliday said.

He laughed as he told of people
who believed that all scientists
were bent on world destruction
and worked in dark secret labs
where - the cobwebs hung thick
from the ceiling.

But, while he feels that science
itself is innocent, Dr. Halliday is
conscious of the threat that mili-
tary‘ applications of scientiﬁc prin-
ciples have to the world.

Each country, he said, is holding
the bomb as a threat to hostile
neighbors, and a fast and furious
race is in progress between na-
tions to develop bigger, more pow-
erful, and more deadly means of
destruction.

“My outlook for the future
is gloomy indeed,” he said,
“and I don’t think there is ‘
anything much to be done
about it.”

Dr. Halliday cited history for his
belief that there would never be a
peaceful world.

“Since the beginning of time,
men. have entertained notions for
selﬁsh desire and have exhibited
the same war-like characteristics,”
he said.

Pressure of Society

He explained that social pres-

Doubt Dispelletl

Chancellor Fitzgerald’s statement that the University
will make an effort to increase the faculty’s salaries by 10
per cent should put an end to the doubt and confusion now
prevalent on campus.

His further statement that there will be reductions in
overload teachings in order to save money should not be
viewed in the dismal light that many have held it.

First because there are far fewer teachers carrying extra
classes than had earlier been supposed. Only a relatively
small number of the faculty will be effected.

The chancellorls statement is in line with a resolution’
passed by the University Senate last year. Then the faculty
urged that overload be reduced to a maximum of two hours.
The resolution envisaged an end in the near future of over-
load teaching.

_ :- ;' fféund reason why we should not become hysterical
over the reduction is that it will enable harried professors
to devote mor of their time to their regular classes than
they have in t e past. And it was recognized that over-
‘load teaching was an expedient devised to meet the inﬂux
of veterans. The veterans have gone and many students
oeen called to the service. The reductions seem further justi-
ﬁed by the fact that this is an ebb year in the population due
to the depression of the thirties.

7 ‘e. l'.Tniversity’s effort to increase salaries at a time
when its income is uncertain is an indication that the plight
of the faculty has not been ignored._.We hope that the chan-
cellor’s announcement will give heart to those who feared
that no increase would be forthcoming. We hope that it
will keep here those who were planning to leave.

Kl/nfurl the Flag

The Pitt Student Federalists have run into an adminis-
trative roadblock in their attempt to present the University
with a United Nations Flag. They were prepared to make
the presentation last Wednesday when a high United World
Federalist officer was visiting the city. The ﬁnal okay, how-

. ever, for the acceptance seems to have landed in some ad-

ministration ﬁle box, and they still have the ﬂag.

The emblem is of no value if it is lying in some cabinet
on the campus. It demonstrates nothing, it signiﬁes nothing.
Without a ﬂag pole it is just so muchcolored cloth.

We would like to urge the administration to pass on the
ﬂag immediately. So far Dean of Women Helen P. Rush has
okayed it. The okay should be passed along.

mcx suvo

There is much to be admired down at the Stephen Foster
Memorial these evenings. Mr. Harvey Pope and his Pitt Play-
ers have lampooned a melodrama of the nineties, Gold In The

Hills, in robust fashion, added

several remarkably entertain-

ing specialty acts, and come up
with the season's most sparkling
dividend.

Gold In the Hills, or The Dead
Sister’s Secret which concerns .it-
self more with oil in the backyard
and the possible deﬂowering of
the heroine, is rich in the exag-
gerated posturing and dated‘ dec-
lamations that ﬂavored turn of
the century drama, and Mr. Pope’s
actors make the most of its possi-
bilities.
Every-thing There

None of the necessary ingredi-
ents are missing. Hero, heroine,
villian, candy at intermission,
stubborn papa, dead sister—you
get them all.

In the play’s leading roles Lora
Thompson is wonderfully pure as
Nell, and Jerry Lynch’s son-of-
the-soil hero could not be improv-

and there are accomplished touches
by Pat Moffat, William Pitchford,

Sets. Dances Good

Technically, the show won my
appreciation of Robert Prender-
ville’s stylish sets; of Rose Muk-
erji’s dances which are spirited
and graceful; and of the skillful
backgrounds by Benny Benack
and his musicians.

But the show’s real gold lies
with the Specialty Acts. Mr. Pope
has invested this part of his pro-
duction with people who really
know their way around a song and
dance, and the results could hard-
ly have been better.

Particularly Josephine Bosco.
Miss Boscos ‘Diamond Lil” is a

riotous triumph, and easily
evening’s top nugget.

Soldiers. Prices. and Birds

BOB THOM

The military is in the news again.

Now, according to a friend of ours, we have an uniden-
tiﬁed lieutenant-colonel somewhere in the Cathedral who
is giving the absent—minded professors a run'for their money.

The colonel in question got on the elevator the other
day and asked the operator, “Do you stop at nine?”

“No,” said the man, “either eight or ten.”

The colonel thought a minute.¢
“I’ve got it,” he said, “let me
out at eight; it’s closer.” '

Letter from Home

The military also, at least the
ones that come from Pitt, are go-
ing to get a letter from home
pretty soon. It will be Student
Congress’ Servic‘emen’s Newsletter
which goes in the mail sometime
next week. Editor Greg Bleakley
has about a 250—name mailing list
right now.

The latest victim of rising costs
on campus is the Carnival section
of Spring Festival. The Carnival
people have to pay the Buildings
and Grounds Department for elec-
tricity and labor.

In 1949 the total cost hit $559.18
while last year it rolled up to
$747.41. No one knows where the

=Wanled:_54.5O

thing will stop before the shows
are packed away this’ summer.

Campus Cleanup

The two walks running between
the Cathedral and Heinz Chapel
are a little cleaner today, even
though it might not show. Last
Saturday ODK President Howard

Greenberger and some of the big-

gest campus wheels cleaned off
the ODK walk to get it ready for
Tap Day.

Tuesday night a gang of Pan-
ther Club initiates literally scrub-
bed the other walk clean. It, by
the way is going to be called
Varsity Walk from now on.

In case Andy Schurman hasn’t
told you yet, the big elm tree

Uncle Sam, Dean Rush, and poor planning have com-
bined to put the long-desired, hard—won Commons Room
Dance all but beyond the limit of the average Pitt seinor.
And very little can be done about it. /

A high-priced ‘name’~ band, a whopping big state and
federal amusement tax, and the cost of hauling rehearsal
props in and out of the Commons Room are the major factors

that boosted the price of dance¢

ducats to $4.50 per couple.

Added to the initial cost will
be, for many men, a six-buck (at
least) charge for tux rental and
taxi or gasoline expense for
hauling long-gowned coeds to and
from the Cathedral.

High-Prced Formalify

This stems from the dance com-
mittee’s decision to require for-
mal dress, a defensive move in
every case except this one, where
continued social use of the Com-
mons Room by students depends
on a successful turn-out. And the
number of seniors who have
twenty dollars on hand after
graduation fees, rings, Owls, and
like costs-of-graduating may not
amount to 600, the number of
couples necessary to_ make the
dance ﬁnancially solvent.

Thincla-ds_Meet
At South Bend

By DON SCHURMAN
Sports Writer

Pitt at last drops its under-
dog role to Notre Dame as
the Panther thinclads face
the stingless Irish on even
terms at South Bend tomor-
TOW.

The Panthers go into the
meet with a 1-1 record. In con-
trast, the Irish have swung a
rather weak shillalah so far this
year.

Notre Dame finished second in
a triangular meet with Purdue
and Northwestern, and in its only
dual meet, they were run into the
ground by Missouri, 105-26.

Another Thriller?

However, Coach Carl Olson
claims, “Missouri ranks with the
best in the nation this year.
Notre Dame is still good.”

The deciding margin of the
meet may compare with last year’s
for thrills. Then Pitt surprised a
heavily-favored Notre Dame
team at the Stadium, 65% to 651/2.
Both teams have nine lettermen
returning from last year.

Panther injuries may be a de-
ciding factor in the meet. Sprinter
Norm Kutcher and Co-captain
Dick Firsching are out of the line-
up, both with leg injuries.

Kuzma Tested
With Kutcher injured, Pitt is

especially vulnerable in the
sprints, one of Notre Dame’s
stronger spots. Notre Dame’s

sprint medley team ﬁnished sec-

Individually, Frank Kuzma will
probably get his best competition
so far this year from Irish miler
Conrad Retrault. Another Notre
Dame topﬂight performer is cap-
tain and 880 runner Val Muscato.

Javelin thrower Jack Adams
will travel with the team for the
ﬁrst time this season. Because the

javelin is outlawed in Ohio,
Adams was not able to compete
as yet.

Coach Olsonand the team will
leave by plane early tomorrow
evening.

streak to ﬁve straight.

On Tuesday Pitt whitewashed
Gettysburg, 9-0, and on Wednes-
day the Panthers took over Car-
negie Tech 7%-11/5.

Saturday at Yale, there will be
36 holes of medal play with the
low four scores counting toward
the team championship, On Sun-
day and Monday, 16 qualiﬁers will
pair off in match play to deter-
mine the individual champion.

Those who made the trip to

Winning Netters
PlayGenevaToday

After sweeping three
matches in a row, the Pan-
ther netters will be out to
add to their winning streak
against Notre Dame and Geneva
over the weekend.

Notre Dame is here for a match
on the Mellon courts tomorrow at
2 p.m_ The Geneva match is
scheduled for 1 p.m. today, also
on the Mellon courts.

Notre Dame’s encounter with
the Panthers will be the second
one of the day for the Irish. They
play Duquesne’s netters in a
morning match at 9:30 a.m.

Racqueteers Hot

In smashing their way to three
straight victories, the Panther
racqueteers lost only two of the
27 game matches. Gettysburg
bowed to Pitt on Tuesday, 9-0,
while West Virginia and West-
minster lost by 8-1 scores over the
weekend.

In the match with Gettysburg
John Lohstoetter, again ‘playing
in the number one spot, Harry
Campney, Jack Roof, Joe Bendel,
Harry Duncan, and Bob Ilisevich
were the single match winners.

In the doubles it was the teams
of Roof and Ilisevich, Bendel and
Jack Hardman, and Dave Licht-
man and Jack Beerman that
brought home the laurels.

Another Whitewash

This marks the second time this
season that the Panthers have
whitewashed their opponents and
brought their season record to
4-3. ‘

Campney and Ilisevich both
with 6-1 records and Lohstoetter
with a 5-2 record have been the
standouts so far.

Other records are:
Bendel 3-4,
Lichtman 1-0‘,

Sports Editor
Tomorrow’s Spring Festival Bowl game between the
Old-Timers and Len Casanova’s varsity may not be much
in the way of a ball game, but everybody ought to have a

lot of fun.

John Chickerneo, the Old-Timer coach, is getting into
the spirit of things as he plans to use a 12-man team against
0

the varsity.

The 12th man will be a man

with cards outlining the plays
the Old-Timers will use. When
the Old-Timers go into a huddle,
the 12th man will ﬂash a card
with the next play to be used,
and then bow out while his mates
run the play.

Chick Optimistic

Quoting Coach Chick-
erneo on the chances of his
team: “We’ll knock the hell
out of them for one minute.
Then they’ll have to carry us
out.” \

‘Chick’ is not predicting a loss
for his team, however. He and
his board of strategy-—Luby Di-
Meolo, Mike Nixon, and now
Woody Wolf—-forsee victory.

Wolf, the radio broadcaster of
Pitt games. came along with Carl
DePasqua from Williamsport for
the game. Wolf is now on the
growing list of advisory coaches.

point of view, is this:

1. Unless the raise is effected,
160 professors, associate profess-
ors, assistant professors, and in-
structors will take a 20% cut in
salary.

2. Some instructors, lecturers,
and graduate assistants, whose
contracts run from year to year,
will be out of ajob. These people
have already been notiﬁed, but
some may be rehired next fall if
enrollment so warrants.

3. A very few raises in rank,
probably without corresponding
increases in pay, will be made.

4. All tenure faculty who- have
taught here for two years or more
will probably receive the 10 per
cent raise. For most of the faculty,
this will be a genuine raise. For
those who have depended upon
overtime, it will be a partial com-
pensation for that loss.

Faculty raises since 1945 have
so far amounted to 35.9 per cent
for full professors; 31.9 for assist-
ant and associate professors, and
44 per cent for instructors.
