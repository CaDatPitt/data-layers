E9333 overturns Allocations chair for $5,000

   

Chairs sa budget

Though it violated rules that would
hav '2: prevented any other student group
fro! -n receiving ﬁmding, the SGB granted
llS€"t:lf more than $5,000 for a dinner honor-
‘gfig student leaders last Wednesday.

For the second time in two weeks, SGB
members voted to overrule an Allocations
decision to withhold funding because board
member Marquette Bowman publicized the
dinner before requesting the money.

Any student group that publicizes an
event before submitting a funding request to
the Allocations committee is automatically
denied, according to Allocations Chair
Noelle Campagna.

She said Bowman’s actions illustrate
the Board’s “smug conﬁdence” that they are

an.

able to approve any request they ﬁle,

regardless of what rules they violate in the
process.

“It was nothing like that, though,” said
Board member Christa Douaihy. “We just
made a simple mistake about when we
advertised the dinner.”

But Campagna said the Board should
realize it is not above the rules.

“’Ihe SGB should be held accountable
for its mistakes just like every other student
group on this campus,” she said. ‘They
should set an example.”

Bowman and President Justin
DalMolin stated two weeks earlier that they
would be willing to hold the ceremony hon-
oring student leaders without the dinner if
they couldn’t get the funding from
Allocations.

cuts may eep
programs from
ever raising status

Cesca Antonelli

With the release of this year’s budget proposal, most arts
and sciences chairs are optimistic that the school can overcome
its past ﬁnancial ﬂounderings.

But,‘in the course of becoming ﬁscally sound, some chairs
argue that departments on the bottom of the priority list will
never have enough funding to improve their status.

The Faculty of Arts and Sciences’ budget document
included the reclassiﬁcations of 11 scrutinized departments and
a goal to reduce the tenure—strearn faculty size in the school
from 550 to 505 or 510.

The report’s release has raised a number of issues that
administrators, program chairs, and others said should be at the
heart of any college restructuring — how departments will fare
in the long—run and the role of liberal arts in education.

According to most department chairs, the school’s ﬁscal
dilemmas justify both the reduction of the tenure~track and the
prioritizing of departments within a category system that is two
years old.

“This document gives us a chance to get rid of the negative
energy that was out there before,” said Stephen Coleman, chair
of theater arts, which is in the newly created “transition” cate-
gory. “I’m very encouraged.”

Even with that optimism being echoed by all involved,
some chairs said though the continuous reviews proposed in the
document are a good idea, low-ranking departments may never
get ahead.

Viability

Some chairs have expressed concern about one of the cri-
teria for future reviews spelled out in the report: “program via-
bility.” Viability is deﬁned as “the ability of the department and
the University to provide, on a sustainable basis, the program
students expect when they enroll.”

“Viability is a relative concept,” said Alberta Sbragia, a
member of the advisory committee that wrote the report. “The
American university is going through a significant reshaping. I
don’t think you can have a static deﬁnition of viability. It’s
defined by faculty responses to problems facing the
University.”

FAS Dean Peter Koehler said viability included a pro-
gram’s ability to provide courses and research opportunities.

“It’s ultimately the ability to attract and support students,”
he said. ‘

Sbragia added that viable programs should have arclear
focus.

“Has the program decided on a focal point of strength?”
Sbragia asked.

other cull-oriented mass suicides

The discovery of 39 bodies at a subur-
ban mansion in Rancho Santa Fe,
California was the latest mass suicide by a
religious cult in recent history. The last of
three truckloads of bodies left the site last
Thursday, 18 hours after the bodies were
found. A

Sheriff ’s Lieutenant Jerry Lipscomb
said it appeared the cult members ingested
a drug. He said that a liquid was found at
the scene and that there was no sign of trau-
ma.

Investigators believe the victims died
over a period of six to seven days —— not at
the same time.

Mass suicide has plagued modern soci-
ety for years. Here is a list of other mass sui-g
cides in recent times:

-Mar. 22, 1997 — Five members of the
order of the Solar Temple died in a ﬁery
mass suicide in St. Casimir, Quebec. Other
murder—suicides by Solar Temple cult
members have resulted in 74 deaths in
Canada and Europe. The followers believe
that suicide transports them to new life on a
planet called Sirius.

-Dec. 23, 1995 —— Sixteen members of the
order of the Solar Temple were found dead
in a burned house outside of Grenoble, in
the French Alps. Most of the bodies were
ananged in a star shape on the ﬂoor.

Oct. 5, 1994 — Authorities in Switzerland
found the charred bodies of 48 people

linked to the order of the Solar Temple in a
fannhouse and three chalets. Five more
bodies were found later that year in Morin
Heights, North of Montreal.

-Apr. 19, 1993 —- Branch Davidian leaf"
David Koresh and 80 of his followers 
by ﬁre or gunshot wounds six hours 2%
the FBI started ﬁlling their compound vi;
tear gas. The government called the den
a mass suicide in ﬁres set by cult memb%
after a 51-day armed standoff. _f;_L
K .
-Dec. 13, 1990 — In Tijuana, Mexic '1, 12
people died in a religious ritual after ‘mg.
mg a poisoned sacrament. It was never
clearly established if this was a suicide or an
accident. Authorities said that some kind oi"
industrial alcohol was poured into the fruit
punch for the religious ceremony. They
believe it may have been rubbing alcohol.

-Nov. 18, 1978 — The tragedy at
Jonestown, Guyana, took the lives of more
than 900 followers of the Rev. Jim Jones.
Jones ordered them to drink cyanide-laced
grape punch. He was found dead with a
bullet wound in the head.

Jones led the Peoples Temple in San
Francisco and moved it to Guyana. In the
United States, the Peoples Temple ran a free
clinic, a drug rehabilitation program and
performed other charitable functions. Jones
had also been the chairman of the San
Francisco Housing Authority in 1976.

THE PITT NEWS

Pitt statistics class counts
on DeNarc|o weather

Anne Estonillo

 

Last month the weather report on
Channel 4 said the temperatures would
be in the 30s with snow on the way.

. Channels 2 and ll said it would be

warmer, and the skies looked clear.

But people ended up in sweaters
and warm coats. "

Snow it did.

After all, Joe said it would.

Joe DeNardo, chief meteorologist
at WTAE—TV in Pittsburgh was the
guest speaker at the Katz Business
School last Thursday. The 38-year vet-
eran of TV weather reports was
answering an invitation to speak on the
issue of why meteorologists in the
same area come up with different fore-
casts.

"‘This is not an easy field. Believe
me,” he said. “I can’t do it that well,
and anybody who says they can --
don’t listen to them.”

Twisting his point-
er as he talked,
DeNardo touched on
issues from global
warming to how TV
news was aired. He
used anecdotes and
drawings to describe
why the weather in
Pittsburgh tended to be
so grey in the winter-
time.

He said the air pat-
tern picks up a great
deal of moisture over
the Great Lakes before
heading towards Pittsburgh. As the air
nears the city, it rises, cools, and con-
denses to make clouds. We see it in the
form of rain or snow. As a result, the
combination of mountains and lakes
tends to keep sunny days few and far
between in the winter.

When asked to address global
warming, he gripped the, sides of the
podium, leaned forward and said: “The
squeaky wheel always gets the grease.
I do not believe in global warming.”

DeNardo said toooften people
blamed the yearly changes in weather
on issues like global warming when
they were ignorant of the facts.

In 1988, he said the National
Weather Forecast researched tempera-
ture trends of different cities over a
hundred year period. The study found
no significant increase in temperature
over the years.

“But that’s not controversial,”
DeNardo said. “I just think it’s terri-

DeNardo said very few people
heard about the study because few sta-

tions airedit. The only reason he said
he knew about it was because he got it
on the weather wire.

DeNardo was invited to speak by
Professor Sherryl May last fall after
she started to notice a trend in a weath-
er project she assigned to her students.
She found that after students conduct-
ed the project, they would come up
with similar results: The DeNardo
Forecast.

“Overwhe1mingly I’Ve found,” she
said, “that the majority of the time Joe
DeNardo was the most accurate.”

May said‘ the weather project is
part of her statistics 1130 course,
which is jointly offered by the busi-
ness and statistics departments.
Students in the class keep track of

weather reports to’ determine the most

accurate predictions. She found that

. over the 15 times she conducted the

project, studentsoften chose DeNardo
as the most reliable forecast. While she
did stress that results varied over the
years, what she
thought would be a
random occurrence
wasn’t.

DeNardo said Channel
4 has two meteorolo-
gists, himself and
another colleague. He
said Channel 2 only

11 didn’t have any. He
said that he and his
team take the time to
create their own maps
and forecasts. This
information is then
compared to other predictions.
Channel also 4 has a back—up weather
consulting company, located in
Bridgeville. The company takes time
to brief the weather team on their own
findings.

“The reason for the differences in
forecasts is that a lot of people are ana-
lyzing the data,” DeNardo said.

DeNardo discussed the technical
aspects of weather reporting as well.
He described satellites and sites where
data is gathered around the world. He
energetically discussed the flow pat-
tern, the pattern of the winds, on the
board.

“Weather is not an exact science,”
he said. “As I’ve heard it mentioned

before, [weather] is a science of the v

inferior mind.”

DeNardo said ‘he didn’t mind
being off every once in a while, but he
takes pride in his own work as a mete-
orologist.

“I have a problem with being
wrong on somebody else’s forecast,”
he said.

FAS

But concerned chairs said they were not

worried by the deﬁnition so much as the
implications, when taken in the context of
budget cuts. According to Dennis Looney,
chair of French and Italian, departments at
the end of the priority list are going to get
“pinched.”

“One impact of categories is that depart-
ments atthe bottom will get less, so it will
then be harder [for them] to satisfy new
requirements,” Looney said.

“In the pinched departments; [providing

those courses] will be harder and harder to .

do. I feel the categories may be putting cer-
tain programs in a position to lose... rather

than a position to win. Perhaps a more hon— ,
’ est approach would be to say, ‘The study of

X isn’t worth as much [to us] as the study of
Y.’ I would almost prefer that course of
bluntness.”

French and Italianwere reclassiﬁed in
the report as category three, “quality core,”
but even chairs of higher—ranked depart-

. ments admit that there may be problems.

“It’s certainly not going to be easy [for
some departments to improve],” said
Raymond Owen, chair of political science, a
category two department. “[But] my under-
standing is that the
provost has discre-
tionary funds, and if
departments have good
ideas, they can apply
for them.”

The original rank-
ings, released in April
1.995, raised the issue of
a departrnent’s “central-
ity to the University’s
mission.” David
Bimbaum, chair of the
Slavic department, now
also in category three,
said that viability, like
centrality, is circular. .

“If they make your *
[department’s] courses required, you’re cen-
tral. If they don’t, ‘you’re not,” he said.
“Viability is circular too. If they give you
funding, you’re viable. If they don’t, you’re
not.” .
Other chairs said that departments in
lower categories would not have trouble get-
ting funding just based on their ranking.

“I honestly do not expect that to hap-
pen,” said Coleman, whose department is in
the last category. “The reading I get and have
gotten all along, regardless of any ideologi-
cal conﬂicts with the dean’s ofﬁce in the past
... is that I perceive Koehler and the whole
process as being eminently fair. That will
continue.”

The document says that funding deci-
sions will not be based on the categorization
of departments. “They will be based on a
unit's ability to demonstrate that the invest-
ment of resources in that unit will pay off
when measured against the goals established
for FAS as a whole.”

A liberal education

Though the report does not close the
debate between a liberal arts education and

 

   
   
 
  
 
  
   

THE PITT NEWS

FROM PAGE

professional training, most chairs agreed that
the document was not as damaging to a

broad—based education as they had feared it‘

would be_.

“I see nothing in the document to sug-
gest that the University lacks commitment to
broad general arts education,” ‘said Anne
Weis, chair of history of art and architecture,
a category one department. “The University
insists departments ﬁnd ways to review their
own success in making the aspect of liberal
arts education that they teach accessible to
undergraduates and review their success in
training graduate students.”

Looney said that the document, rather
than reducing language programs as some
had feared it would, brought out a new com-
ponent to a broad education.

‘”I'hey’ve redeﬁned a traditional liberal
arts education by adding ‘international
issues’, which I’m happy to see,” Looney
said. “It doesn’t set speciﬁc details connect-
ed with that category, but it’s potentially a
very interesting new feature, an internation-
al dimension [on a liberal arts education].”

Sbragia said that committee members
talked at length about issues related to a lib-
eral education.

“Sometimes [in
discussion], I put on my

parent, would this
impress me?  What is
a liberal arts education?
Have the components
changed?

“I think that a

education], a necessary
component to being
_ considered a well-edu-
* cated person.”

Pitt’s international centers, like the
Western European Studies Center that
Sbragia chairs, are magnets for research and
funding, she said — another reason intema—
tional affairs were stressed in the report.

Koehler said he hoped the document
showed a need to bridge the gap between lib-
eral arts skills and professional training.

“We had a sense of responsibility, that
you have to provide students both with a lib-
eral arts education and with the idea that they
can get a job,” Koehler said. “[A liberal edu-
cation] is a common set of tools you can
apply to ‘solve a wide set of problems. There
was a lot of discussion about how to com-
bine a liberal arts education with the neces-
sary skills and options.”

Alan Sampson, chair of statistics in cat-
egory three, agreed.

“The goal is to prepare students in
breadth of education  but also to teach the
skills and knowledge base that allow them to
take on work in 21st century,” Sampson
said. "The world is changing, so you need
traditional liberal arts skills and understand-
ing of some more technical kinds of things 
People have to know more to be successful.”

SGB

Still, the Board has overturned the deci-
sion to deny the funding, and the dimer will
continue as planned.

During the Wednesday meeting,
Campagna asked to be recognized to dis-
cuss old business. This old business was
whether or not SGB should be granted the
$6,982.30 for which they had asked to fimd
the dinner ceremony. .

Once recognized, Campagna read from
a prepared statement:

“Today, the Allocations Committee
considered for the second time the request
subrriitted by the Student Government
Board for the Student Organization
Recognition Dinner.

“The total amount of the program is
$6,982.30. If the program had been subrnit—
ted in a timely fashion, the Committee
would have rriade the following recommen-
datiori: Of the $5,343.75 in food requested,
the Committee would have recommended
approval of only $4,518.75. Of the
$1,638.55 requested for awards, the
Committee felt that anything greater than
$200.00 would have been excessive.”

Campagna stressed that her
Comrriit1ee’s decision was rriade in part
because the program request had not been
submitted in a timely manner.

The statement went on, “Because the
Board has already committed itself to this
event prior to receiving funding and has
made no arrangements for alternative fimd—

'l'I'IE PITT NEWS

ing, the Committee still feels that they have

violated a policy mandating that no com-

mitments be made before allocations are
made.

“As the ability for the Board to enact
this program is contingent on the monies
requested, the Committee has no choice but
to deny this request a second time.”

Student Government Board has the
power to overturn an Allocations
Committee decision. Allocations anticipat-
ed that this was what SGB would do.
Because of this, Carripagna said her com-
mittee felt it was within their duty to ask the
Board to act responsibly where this matter
was concerned.

“It is the hope of the Allocations
Committee that the Board use these factors
in determining a ﬁnal decision in regards to
this request,” she said, concluding her state-
ment.

The matter was then turned over to the
Board for a vote, but all eight members
ignored her request and decided instead to
grant themselves almost all of the requested
money. A

Board member Brian Riemer motioned
for the Board to give themselves $5,098.44,
rather than the $6,982.30 they had origirial—
ly asked for. Board members voted unani-
mously to accept the proposal and grant
themselves the $5,098.44.

But some Allocations’ recormnenda—
tions were heeded in the revised request.

Marquette Bowman said that SGB had
found a way to keep the cost of awards to
$200.00, as Allocations had recommended.

By limiting the cost of awards to that
amount, SGB would have to decrease atten-
dance to 275 rather than the 300 people they
had initially planned on

Cassidy

meteorite recovery program funded by
the National Science Foundation. His
crew found the meteorite from Mars that
researchers say may contain traces of fos-
sil bacterial life.

While the idea that life may have
developed independently on another plan-
et is still a speculation,
Cassidy said that if it is
ever proven, it “could be
the most valuable and
interesting rock that has
ever been found.”

Cassidy also led
investigations in north-
ern Argentina at the
Carnpo del Cielo, which
means “Field of the
Sky.” There he docu-
mented one of the first
known occurrences of
multiple impact craters.
Fragments of a large
meteorite all struck the earth at the same
time and created at least 20 small craters
which are about 100 feet in diameter.

Harvard’s Center for Astrophysics
and Planetary Science announced narriing

the planet “3382 Cassidy” on Feb. 19,

1997 on behalf of the International
Astronomical Union.
Cassidy didn’t even know about it at

first.
“I didn’t hear about it until later,” he
said. “It was, a nice surprise.’’, _

 

This isn’t the first time he’s had an
unusual object named for him. A glacier
also bears his name. While redoing an
Antarctic map, his friends found several
unnamed features and gave one the name
“Cassidy.”

Another friend working at the
Smithsonian discovered
a rare mineral which he
named Cassidyite.

Cassidy said it is
“kind of nice” to have all
these things named for
him, but it is also frustrat-
ing because he has never
seen any of them. The
mineral is very rare, and
Cassidy said he is not
planning an expedition to
Antarctica to see his
glacier because he is “too
old.”

The planet is small and
faint enough that you can only see it with
a very powerful telescope, and it has
never been photographed. Cassidy said he
will probably never see it. 1

“I’ll have to take somebody’s word
that it is up there,” he said.

The minor planet, also called an
asteroid, 3382 Cassidy is a rocky mass
about 6 to 9 miles in diameter. Its orbit is
in the asteroid belt between Mars and
Jupiter, and it takes 3.36 years to com-_

plete its trip around the sun. V i

 

Henry Giclas, currently an
astronomer emeritus in Flagstaff,
Arizona, discovered 3382 Cassidy in
1948 while at Lowell Observatory in
Flagstaff. The discoverer has the right to
name the minor planets he found, but
Giclas said he has found so many that he
ran out of names for them, so he is open
to suggestions.

To be classiﬁed as a minor planet,
Giclas said, the body must have a unique
orbit. Before it is established as a planet,
it must circle the sun at least two or three
times. Then it is given a provisional num-
ber until someone suggests a name.

Truman Kohman, professor of chem-
istry emeritus at CMU, and Bruce Hapke,
professor of geology and planetary sci-
ence at Pitt, suggested that one be named
after Cassidy because of his prominence
in meteorite research.

Kohman shared an interest with
Cassidy in tektites, which are natural
glasses formed from the heat of impact
from extremely large meteorites, which
melt the »earth’s surface. He also was a
member of Cassidy’s first ﬁeld expedition
in Argentina.

Hapke, also a professor of geology
and planetary sciences at Pitt, has worked
with Cassidy for many years, including
extensive research with the weathering of
the moon’s surface.

Hapke also has a minor planet, 3549
Hapke, named after him in honor of his

work with remote sensing of planetary
surfaces.

So, what does one do with a minor
planet? Develop it for real estate?

Hapke said that isn’t so farfetched,
though he’s not talking about anytime in
the immediate future.

So far, many of the meteorites found
have contained resources rare on earth
that could be useful in industry. He said
scientists are trying to come up with ways
to mine the asteroids for those resources.

But those for whom the asteroids are
named should not plan to retain mineral
rights just yet, because currently no one
person or nation can claim exclusive

ﬁve programs a
fighting chance

The term “budget cuts” has been evoking fear throughout the
University as the fate of FAS departments has been debated. The
FAS deliberations determine the shape of Pitt education. '

Every department in FAS now faces close scrutiny and constant
review. Those in the transitional category have the most tenuous
position. These are the areas which are making changes and must
continue making changes. Unfortunately, the standards to which
they must now comply might also be out of reach.

The review criteria attracting the most concern from some
department chairs is “program viability,” that is, according to the

@L°r>e9BV~ :44

FAS budget proposal, “the ability of the department and the
University to provide, on a sustainable basis, the program students
expect when they enroll.” .

Providing these resources requires money, and the transitional
category marks the bottom of the administrations’ priority list;
departments in this group may receive less funding than others
unless they can pull themselves out of this category. Taking money
from these departments would make it harder for them to provide
courses and research opportunities. Therefore, they would not be
able to improve in the manner called for by the budget FAS would
be dangling a carrot that only the departments which are already
strong will be able to reach. ,

Pitt cannot strengthen itself with this approach. In fact, the
whole review process should be revamped. FAS should be going to
each department and getting them to do internal reviews. (Surely a
professor of geology knows what makes a good geology department
better than a removed administrator does.) First, allow the depart-
ment to identify its strengths and weaknesses. Then, bring in an out-
side review.

_ FAS should be doing their best to help departments which are
struggling to get better. They need to tell programs what they are
looking for, and then do everything they can to help each one get
there.

Calls for restructuring should not be answered with massive cut-
ting. Pitt’s administration needs to stop chopping off the arms of
departments and telling them to do push—ups. Instead, they should be
helping each program become the best that it be. Pitt cannot contin-
ue to be a world-class university if it keeps cutting off its limbs.

Education should not be indoctrination  

 

If you want to ﬁnd out what’s
wrong with our educational system,
I may have some bad news for you.

It won’t happen by irnplement—
ing new policies or strategies to
make people learn. And, despite
what some conservatives might tell
you, it has nothing to do with the
size, involvement, or power of gov-
emment.

Because the system doesn’t
need reform. We do. .

The March 9 issue of the
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette carried an
article written by David Walsh, a
professor of politics at the Catholic
University of America, which origi-
nally appeared in The Washington
Post. He suggested, I think correct-
ly, that perhaps too much responsi-
bility has been placed on schools and
politicians when the problem with
student achievement lies elsewhere.

The title of the article? “Student,
Reform Thyse 

You see, we have in this country
an educational system that empha-
sizes getting ahead rather than leam-
ing. That shouldn’t surprise anyone,
considering our proclivity toward
feeding our addiction by procuring
goods and services that we don’t
need.

Think about it. When we say we
want a good “education” for our
children, we really mean this: we’re
supposed to move to wealthy areas,
send them to school, hope they get
good grades so they can get into an
exclusive college, come out after
four years, and get that big job mak-
ing lots of money so that they can
continue participating in that spend-
ing orgy we call American con-
sumerism. (Out of breath? Well,
that’s the point.)

However, in such an atmos-
phere, we don’t learn, and thus can-
not teach, how to think critically and
to make judgments of the world
around us and how we ﬁt into it.
Education in that sense devolves into
mere indoctrination, which basically
ttnns students into zombies who tell
teachers what they may want to hear.
We make up, person for person,
probably the most ignorant society in
the industrialized world.

Anyone who has taken general
writing here at Pitt knows the story
of the so-called “scholarship boy,”
described by Richard Hoggart and
embodied by Chicano writer
Richard Rodriguez, whose be-all
and end—all was to regurgitate infor-
mation so he could pass exams and
look “educated” with the requisite
credentials. However, he focused
himself on getting the right answers
but never took the time to leam to
think for himself.

I know all about that.

I began my college career as an
engineering major, not because I
enjoyed the ﬁeld, but because it was
supposedly my ticket to ﬁnancial
security. However, my father, whose
idea that was, didn’t want me to
think for myself. One of his favorite
sayings to me was “You’re too
young to have an opinion!” (That
may be hard to believe, considering
I’m now planning a career in opinion
writing.)

Anyway, after being thrown out
of school twice, the second time by
Pitt in May of 1983, I had to ﬁgure
out what I really wanted in life —
and more importantly, who and what
I was.

And you know what? Since I
came back to school in 1993 for the
correct reasons, I appreciate it more
and have actually done quite well.

Disciplines such as history, philoso-
phy, and political science, likely bor-
ing to most 20-sornethings, I actual-
ly get excited about and drive to
excel. I remember once telling my
stepfather that I got a B+ in a PoliSci
class. He said, “That’s a good grade.”

“Yeah,’_’ I said, “but I wanted an
A.”

Not only that — much learning
takes place outside the classroom.
For example, you know those “bull
sessions” between instructors and
students that used to take place over
a beer at, say, Hemingway’s, before
concerns about underage drinking
and improper student-teacher con-
tact? They will tell you that’s where
a lot of serious learning takes place. I
don’t drink, but I do participate in
those discussions whenever possi-
ble. Here’s a dirty little secret: leam-
ing has to do, really, with relation-
ship-building. (Note: That’s why
“school-choice” will fail and out-
come—based education misses the
point.)

My writing for The Pitt News is
a valid part of my education, due less
to the actual writing involved than to
the research and critical thinking my
columns require. I’ve taken some
strong stances; however, I had better
know what I’m talking about and
have some proof to back it up. (In
fact, I consider myself a journalist
ﬁrst — albeit one with an attitude.)

So where’s the answer? Well,
not to overuse a cliche, but it lies
deep within you. Study, question,
challenge. Get in someone’s face,
and take nothing at face value. You
may disagree with campus conserv-
atives, as I do, but at least they’re
using the educational process cor-
rectly.

8 ‘ THE PITT NEWS Monday, March 31, I997

‘ ‘Letters to the editor may be addressed to The Pitt News,

 orial for
Jack Wilson

The memorial for the four stu-
dents killed in India while enrolled
in the Spring 1996 Semester at Sea
program which ran in the March 27
issue of The Pitt News was quite
touching. However, another very
important_ person, though not a stu-
dent, died that day — Jack Wilson.
He and his wife Theresa, originally
from Pittsburgh, were a joy to have
on the-ship. Jack especially touched
my heart because he reminded me of
my own, late father. Jack was always
smiling and dancing around. He was
at the union bar quite a few nights
hanging out with us college kids. He
played the piano and sang for us at
the coffee house (all of those from
SAS Spring ‘96 will remember).
When I first met him, he asked what
my major was. When I replied, “psy-
chology,” he told me that he was a
sociology major. His response was,
“Psychologists do it one on one, but
sociologists do it in a group.” Jack
was always making people smile,
like a beam of sunshine. The death of
our friends was very tragic, and
Jack’s death hit me personally. My
sincerest sympathies go out to all of
the loved ones of our friends that
died March 27, 1996, but please
don’t forget about this wonderful,
wonderful man! i

Review board will
boost confidence
in police

Two weeks ago, in these pages,
an apologist for the police compared
the proposed civilian police review
board to “Communist Party tactics of
the 1940s.” And FOP president,
Smokey Hynes, continues to insult
the public’s intelligence by suggest-

ing that complaints against the
police are “fraudulent” and that con-

cerned citizens are guilty of
“forgery,” circulating “bogus” peti-
tions. Apparently, the Justice

Department investigation, exposing
a long history of police brutality, and
a class action suit with scores of cit-
izen complaints of police miscon-
duct haven’t convinced some folks
that we’ve got a problem in our little

city. From one who has spent many a

mittens 

 

chilly morning collecting signatures
at a Northside grocery store and
elsewhere, the hysterical attacks by
police mouthpieces are, at once, typ-
ical and counterproductive.

Good grief! We’ve got a new
police chief who is trying to weed
out the rogue cops so the majority of
dedicated, professional officers can
do their jobs properly, and even his
efforts are being thwarted by Mr.
Hynes and company. -

The only way to rebuild a trust-
ing, working relationship between
law enforcement and the community
is to stop stonewalling, stop the
name calling, and to open up this
process for citizen oversight. A civil-
ian review board would be a giant
step toward restoring the much-
needed public confidence in the
police. It’s called democracy, Mr.
Hynes, and it’s all about saving the
lives of citizens, as well as the pub-
lic servants sworn to protect them.
Don’t be afraid; the truth may well
set us free.

Non-traditional
students better
off at CCAC

As a Pitt employee, CGS gradu-
ate of 1984, and former President of
CGS Student Government, I have
followed the college over the past 10
years, often with dismay. Just when I
think that it can get no worse, it
does. I
As one who returns for a degree
in my 30s, I can testify to the stress
and confusion of working full-time
and attending school evenings (while
at the same time, serving as a single
parent of two children, mind you). It
would have been nearly impossible
to accomplish without the many
avenues of assistance provided by
the CGS administration and Student
Government offices.

I find it hard to believe the
evening student will receive the
assistance and support that I did
when CGS-sponsored classes and
resources dry up. I also doubt the
CAS administration and SGB will
have either the understanding or
desire to serve the needs of the non-
traditional student. It would seem the
student of the future would do just as
well at CCAC.

Should the govern-
ment run schools?
The editorial board’s recommenda-
tion that the state and federal govem-
ments spend more money on schools is
the perfect example of the mentality
which seems to permeate all failing
government programs: if it doesn’t
work, do it harder. And alternate form
of this mentality can be expressed as: if
it doesn’t work, we must not be spend-
ing enough money — spend more.

The editorial also claims that it is
unfair that students whose parents pay
more money in property tax receive a
better education than those whose par-
ents pay less. If one group is paying
more for a certain service, it is only
right that they get more out of that ser-
vice. And where is the fairness in peo-
ple who do not even have children pay-
ing to educate other people’s children?

All this, of course, ignores the ques-
tion of whether or not the government
should even be running schools. Public
education is yet another example of a
failed government program. If all that
public schools need to improve their
education is more money, how do you
explain that parochial schools turn out a
better education for a fraction of the
money spent per student by public
schools?

The solution to America’s educa-
tion woes is in eliminating government
schools and allowing the infinitely
more potent private sector handle the
job — not spending more money on the
same programs which have been failing
us for years. It’s far too important an
issue to leave in the hands of the gov-
emment.

State stores should
stay as they are

I am against Governor Ridge’s pro-
posal to sell state liquor stores...We
might think it is a good idea, but this
man represents big business...

He won’t allow beer to be sold at
convenience stores because the beer
lobby has contributed to his war chest.
He claims that the state has no business
selling liquor and wine, but he wants to
maintain the wholesale end to maintain
profits. He is worried about alcohol
abuse and social problems, but he wants
to increase private outlets by 100 stores
with hours of 6 a.m. to 2 a.m.

1 He is aJunion—busting governor who

‘ 434 Win. Pitt Union, Pittsburgh, PA l5260. Letters should ,
be kept to 250 words and must include the writer's name,
phone number, and university affiliation (it any).

    

wants to show how he is a hero to the
free enterprise system. Why does he
control the wholesale end of liquor and
wine? Why is he not allowing beer into
the retail market?

This man is a public figure who has
aspirations of higher office. He has
accepted the contributions of big busi-
ness...

The present system is working and
contributes 70 million a year in proﬁts.
It employs 4,000 people...

Yes, we can cry about state-con-
trolled liquor stores, but his plan offers
nothing but a political gain to him. He
wants to  give big business all of the
incentives and advantages.

If you think you will get cheaper
prices on liquor and wine, remember 
the 6 percent and 18 percent tax on all
products.

Keep the present system until we
decide if we want big business dictating
how we  buy our alcohol...

Say no to privatization and tell the
Governor that he must not represent
special interests...

Write or call your legislator and tell
them to vote “no” on this plan.

Criticism comes
with the territory

I have finally grown tired of all of
the letters bashing Matt Grove for his
criticism of Kevin Willard. Those criti-
cizing Grove’s article may not even fol-
low Pitt basketball, and they are losing
sight of the big picture. Ralph Willard’s
main job is to win basketball games,
period. And no matter how much we
may like his son, Kevin, for his attitude,
hustle, and “intangibles,” he clearly did
not help Pitt win basketball games.

We’re talking about a player who
has no conﬁdence in his jump shot,
mainly because he couldn’t hit water if
he fell out of a boat, and his. ball—han—
dling skills are sub-par. Jarrett
Lockhart, a promising freshman,
deserved to be the first guard off the
bench. Given decent playing time,
Lockhart would have proven to be
much better than a stiff like Kevin
Willard.

The job of the sports editor is not to
continually write nice things about Pitt
athletes so that everyone can feel good.
Grove’s job is to objectively analyze
Pitt sports, and if that means an honest
criticism of an athlete, then so be it.

A landlord is unable to spend the
money to meet the demands of his
next-door neighbor to fix his decrepit
building. So, rather than face her in
court and risk being charged with
$50,000 in fines, he digs a tunnel into
her basement, sneaks into her house,
clubs her to death, and is busy cutting
her body apart with a circular saw
when the police find him.

We all shrug things off because
they don’t affect our lives directly.
Terrorists setting off bombs in the
Middle East? Children slowly starving
to death in Somalia while their “lead—
ers” live like kings? Men and women
-- damn it, human beings —-— sleeping
like animals on sidewalks in the mid-

reason, their lives
have lost all direc-

“Gee, that’s terrible,
but it has nothing to
do with me.” And the
next day we forget,
because it doesn’t
matter.

But it does mat-
ter. Every little thing
matters. Because as
we stop caring —— as we strive to pre-
tend that real, true horror doesn’t exist
in this world — as we isolate ourselves '
from everyone else — we are slowly
killing off the soul of the human race.

And if it dies — like the soul of

have mercy on it.

Confessions of
  a cable-sports

addict

 

At any given moment, it’s a pretty
good bet that one of my roommates or
I will be watching a televised sporting
event. The TV in our room is tuned
either to ESPN or Fox Sports
Pittsburgh approximately 23 hours a
day (“The Simpsons” usually gets the
other hour).

My point is that I’ve seen a lot of
junk on TV, such as the “World’s
Strongest Man” competition from

every year since about 1847. That

kind of nonsense still gets on during
prime time, but it’s not nearly as
prevalent as it was, even ten years
ago.

Back in the days when the Big
Three networks still ruled the industry
-— before we all wanted our MTV --
ESPN was a puny little organization
that aired pretty much all junk all the
time. I remember seeing tractor pulls
on ESPN back in those days. Tractor
pulls make the World’s Strongest Man
contest look like the Super Bowl.

From those humble roots, ESPN
has become a giant. They are the
home of major _league baseball, the
NHL, a bazillion college basketball
games every season, and the most
popular NFL pregame/postgame stu-
dio show ever.

Keith Olbermann, the star of
ESPN’s longtime staple,
Sports'Center, even has a national
endorsement deal. Granted, his chick-
en sandwich ads are pretty dumb, but
doing commercials is something that
lesser-known commentator Bob Ley
could only dream about.

ESPN is so big that it’s the second
most interesting sports network in
Pittsburgh. With ESPN and ESPN2,
the last thing we need is more major
league games games on TV. Enter Fox

Panthers sweep double header with 21-run explosion

Patrick Robertson

 

The Pitt baseball (13-7) team swept a

doubleheader from the

Georgetown Hoyas (8-19-1) Thursday at

Trees Field.

Pitt dominated the ﬁrst game, winning
7- 1. The Panthers pounded out 11 hits, and
pitcher Chris Gallick held Georgetown to
only ﬁve hits in his seven innings of work

to earn the complete-game victory.

The Panthers got the ball rolling in the
second inning with two runs. Kevin Knox
doubled and then crossed the plate on a
Mike Isaac home run. The early scoring
would put Pitt in front to stay.

Pitt added another run in the third
when Rob Garvey singled in a runner from
second. The Hoyas got their lone run in the

visiting

top of the fourth.

In the bottom of the same frame, Lou

Melucci hit another two-run homer to
drive in Isaac from second base. Sam
Crowley hit a sacriﬁce ﬂy to drive in Mark
Mehalovich from third. This gave the
Panthers a 6-1 lead.

In the ﬁfth, Garvey got his second
RBI of the game, with a solo blast to give
the Panthers a 7-1 lead.

Gallick racked up 10 strikeouts and
gave up one earned run, along with two

When number two seed
Erin Shalbrack had knee
surgery this summer, her tennis
career seemed to be in jeop-
ardy. But after watching the
sophomore’s performance
Thursday at Robert Morris, it’s
difﬁcult to imagine the severity
of the pain she’s been ﬁghting
through all season long.

“I was having knee sore-
ness, but I did pretty well,” said
Shalbrack, who contributed to
Pitt’s 6-3 victory by defeating
Natalie Arvelo, 6-0, 7-5.

As the season has worn on,
the pounding from playing on
artiﬁcial surfaces has taken its
toll on Shalbrack’s knee, as
was evident during her match.

“It got close toward the
second set, but I ﬁnished it out.

“Our schedule’s getting

 

harder, and practice is getting a
lot more rigorous,” said
Shalbrack.

Pitt ﬁnished out six of its
nine matches with Robert
Morris and picked up its 13th
victory of the season in the
process.

“We needed this win to
keep our winning streak alive,”
said senior Tamara Kalesnik,
referring to the team’s four-
match rampage.

“It was a very good win
for our team. Overall, the team
has to be very pleased with
their performance.”

Kalesnik, however, wasn’t
pleased with her 6-4, 6-0 loss to
Jen Stankewicz.

“I’m really disappointed
with the way I played today,”
said Kalesnik, who has been
been battling an ear and sinus
infection with some “serious”

antibiotics. “But you’re going

to have bad days, and today
was deﬁnitely one of them.”

“I think my serve was
working well, but my ground
strokes didn’t have any bite to
them.”

Number three seed
Amanda Hoffman defeated
Abby Hauck 6-1, 6-2, and
number ﬁve seed Beth Gang
beat Melissa Lockhart 6-2, 6-2.
Hoffman and Gang continue to
lead the team in victories, with
16 apiece. .

“I think I’ve been playing
we ,” said Hoffman, who has
won her last four matches.

Hoffman said this fall’s 5-
4 loss to Robert Morris added a
little incentive to the match.

“We felt last time we could
have done better and this time
we did,” she said.

Freshman Alison Bucher
recorded Pitt’s fourth singles’
victory of the afternoon when

she blanked Chris Ciufo 6-0, 6- n

0.

In doubles, Fran Davis
(who lost 4-6, 6-2, 6-1 to Alexis
Smith) teamed with Shalbrack
to defeat Smith—Arvelo 8-1,
and Hoffman and Jen Bible
blanked Robert Morris’s
Hauck-Ciufo tandem 8-0.

“The team overall is get-
ting more aggressive and more
conﬁdent with every match,”
said Shalbrack.

“Everybody’s rising to the
occasion when we play big
teams.”

With wins over
Connecticut and Villanova
already under their belts, the
Panthers hope to rise to the
occasion when they face Big
East rivals Georgetown and
West Virginia April 12. In the
meantime, Pitt will visit
Carnegie Mellon tomorrow at
3 p.m.

, There’s a bad joke ﬂoating around
Pittsburgh this Spring. Question: Whats the
most difficult thing about Spring training?
Answer: Naming ﬁve Pittsburgh Pirates.

Actually, the punch line is quite ﬁtting.
Only four players on the Pirates 40-man ros-
ter have over three years of major league ser-
vice -—- Al Martin, Kevin Elster, Steve
Cooke, and Paul Wagner.

What’s more, the revamped lineup will
include two rookies (Tony Womack and
Jose Guillen) along with three others who
are in their second year (Jermaine
Allensworth, Joe Randa, and Jason
Kendall).

The youth and inexperience of the 1997
Pirates results front a series of trades this past
off season, which shrank the payroll to a
mere $13 million, or $2 million more than
the White Sox will shell out to sluggerAlbert
Belle alone this year.

It’s a sad but sobering fact which
reflects the vast economic division between
the wealthy mega-markets like Chicago
verses Pittsburgh, one of the smallest and
poorest markets in baseball.

After four straight losing seasons, man-
ager Jim Leyland left at the end of last sea-
son for Miami to manage the Marlins.

Also gone are last 'year’s team of Jay
Bell, Carlos _Garcia, Jeff King, Orlando
Mereed, Mike Kingery, Denny Neagle,
Danny Darwin, Charlie Hayes, Dave Clark,
Nelson I_.iriano and Dan Plesac.

“We had to head in a diiferent direc-
tion,” says manager Gene Lamont, who
replaced Leyland after serving as the third
base coach last year. "The players we had
probably weren’t going to lead us back to
being a contending 

So the rebuilding starts — again. Here
are your 1997 Pittsburgh Pirates:

The pitching rotation will consist of
right—handers Jon Lieber, Jason Schmidt,
Francisco Cordova, Esteban Loaiza, and
southpaw Steve Cooke. Lieber, who relies
on control and pitch location, will anchor the
staff. Lieber compiled a 9-5 record last year
while keeping his ERA just under 4.00.
Cooke, who won 10 games as a rookie in
‘93, is coming back from severe shoulder
troubles which left him unable to pitch for
most of the past two seasons. Power pitcher
Jason Schmidt, who’s fast ball has reached
the mid-90’s, has missed time this spring
after team physicians detected an inegular
heartbeat. Although Schmidt was 5-6 with a
5.76 ERA, he displayed an overpowering
fast ball at times after coming from Atlanta
in the Denny Neagle trade. Both Loaiza and
Cordova pitched enatically last year with
their ERA’s at 4.96 and 4.09 respectively.

If any of these pitchers falters, rookie
Rich Loiselle will be waiting in the bullpen.
Loiselle, a right—hander who the Bucs
acquired from Houston last season for

PA’s finest: Bucs, Phillies race
for next-to-last in standings

Danny Darwin, will join setup man Marc
Wilkins (3.84 ERA), along with fonner
starter and current closer John Ericks (5.79
ERA), who converted eight of 10 save
opportunities last, season. Rookies Dave
Wainhouse (25 saves in Class AA) and lefty
Jeff Granger (2.34 ERA in Class A) will
also pitch in relief. ‘

Second-year catcher Jason Kendall,
who has quickly risen to veteran status, will
try to guide the young Pirate hurlers. Kendall
ﬁnished third in the Rookie of the Year bal-
loting, after hitting .300 with three homeruns
and 42 runs batted in. Backing up Kendall is
the versatile Keith Osik (.293, 1 HR, 14
RBI), who can play third base and the out-
ﬁeld.

The starting outﬁeld consists of team

leader and offensive catalyst A] Martin
(.300,l8 HR, 72 RBI, 38 SB) in left, second-
year Speedster Jermaine Allensworth (.262,
4 HR, 31 RBI, 11 SB) in center, and 20-year-

old phenom Jose Guillen in right. Guillen '

will attempt to make the jump to the majors
from Class A Lynchburg after hitting .400 in
Grapefruit League this spiring. The enigmat-
ic Midre Cummings (55 RBI in A) will
be Guillen’s insurance policy. Emil Brown, a
Rule Five draft pick from Oakland’s Class A
team, will ride out this year with the Pirates
afterknockingin l3runsinMarchwitl1a
.355 average.

First baseman Mark Johnson (.274, 13
HR, 47 RBI) will provide the majority of
Pittsburgh’s power. The big southpaw had a
monster spring batting .439 with six homers
and 24 RBI in 18 games.

After several stints with the Pirates,
rookie Tony Womack will ﬁnally settle in to
the starting lineup. He won a three—way
competition for the second base job this
spring by hitting .364 with ﬁve steals.
Womack stole 37 bases forAAA Calgary in
‘96 and should begin the season as the club’s
lead off hitter and primary base running
threat

After trading Jay Bell to the Royals, the
Pirates addressed the hole at shortstop by
signing KevinE1ster (.252 24 HR, 99 RBI)
as their lone free agent The veteran sur-
prised everyone last year by showing

uncharacteristic power numbers while bat-

ting ninth for the Texas Rangers. The Pirates
can only hope for a repeat of last year’s per-
fonnance from Elster, who will bat ﬁfth
behind Johnson.

At third base, newcomer Joe Randa
(.303, 6 HR, 47 RBI) will bring his smooth
ﬁelding and high average from Kansas City,
along with backup Kevin Young (.242, 8
HR, 23 RBI), who returns from a one year
hiatus with the Royals. Dale Sveurn will ﬁll
in at all four inﬁeld positions and provide a
power threat off the bench.

While the Pirates may be the butt of
baseball jokes this year, people won’t be
laughing much longer. With potential stars
like Chad Hennansen, Freddy Garcia, ‘and

, free passes in the game.

Pitt left six on base and the Hoyas
stranded ﬁve in the game. Both teams stole
two bases.

Pitt baseball Coach Mark Jackson said
that there is no one star on his team and that
everyone contributed. This was deﬁnitely
true in this game, where no single player
had more than two RBI.

Pitt won the second game by a con—‘
.vincing score of 1448. Pitcher Kevin
Lazeski got. the caH for the Panthers and the
win. He pitched 5 2/3 innings, striking out

four and surrendering seven runs on nine *

hits.

This game was more sloppy than the
first, as each team committed three errors.
The Hoyas would stay sloppy on the offen-
sive end —— Georgetown left 10 runners on

base as opposed to Pitt’s five.
The Hoyas went one, two, three in the

A ﬁrst. Pitt pounded out ﬁve runs on ﬁve hits

in this inning. Jason Workman and Crowley
singled to put runners at the comers. Isaac
singled to bring in Workman. Knox drove
in another with a single. Melucci tripled to
clear the bases after Garvey walked.

The Panthers added one more in the
bottom of the second when Isaac singled in

Chris Delsignore, who had doubled. Pitt,

had the opportunity to extend their lead
even farther, but would leave the bases
loaded.

Georgetown got their offense going in

the third on a sacriﬁce ﬂy and an error. This «

made it 6-3.
Before the Hoyas could make the con-
test competitive, Pitt answered in the bot-

tom‘ of the inning with ﬁve more runs.

Workman drove in a run on a single
after two walks and a pitching change.
Garvey then hit a grand slam after two more
walks. '

Georgetown added one in the fourth
and held Pitt scoreless. Neither team scored
in the ﬁfth.

The sixth was a -rough inning for the
Panthers. They gave up four runs on four
hits. Lazeski struck out two of the ﬁrst three
batters but could not get the third out. After
three runs and a wild pitch, he was replaced
by Jory Coughner, who ﬁnished the inning.
He went 1 2/3 innings total, giving up one
hit and striking out four.

Pitt came back with one run in their
half of the sixth. Georgetown scored one
more in the eighth.

 
   

John Schultz recorded the save for the
Panthers after he came in in the eighth to
relieve Coughner. He pitched two innings
picking up two strikeouts and giving up no
hits.

Pitt scored their last two in the bottom
of the eighth to close the game. Schultz got
all three in the ninth to give the Panthers a
win.

The Panthers play again at Duquesne
Monday at 2 p.m. The team’s next home
game will be baseball’s version of the
Backyard Brawl — Big East rival West
Virginia visits Trees Field on Tuesday at 3
p.m.

A trip to Kent State on Wednesday will
finish off a three-day, tliree—game set for the
Panthers. The players get a short rest before
two scheduled doubleheadeis this weekend.

Column 

Sports Pittsburgh. Fox Sports, in its
first year of existence, is already light
years ahead of where ESPN started
out.

Last fall, Fox spent an entire day
televising the WPIAL high school
football championships, from the
smallest schools all the way up to the
heavyweights. Coming from upstate
New York, where high school sports
news is buried on the back pages even
of school district newsletters, it took
me a while to get used to seeing high
school sports on the front page of the
sports section.

I wasn’t ready for TV. There’s a
part of me that says these kids don’t
need the pressure of playing for a TV
audience. Honestly though, wouldn’t
you get a kick out of being on TV,
even if you had a lousy game?

It’s not just high school teams that
get coverage. Not long after the
WPIAL. play offs, the Big East soccer
championship tournament was on.
Then came volleyball. The NCAA
wrestling championships were on not
long ago. The nice thing about all this
is that people who don’t want to take
the effort to go watch a college game
in person could very well come across
the event on TV by accident while
channel surfing and get interested in
It.

Most of the athletes you’ll see on
Fox are not professional superstars.
They work hard, they’re fun to watch
once in a while, and nobody expects
you to be a die-hard fan. At the other
end of the spectrum, if you’re the type
who thinks stuff like volleyball and
wrestling is on the same level as trac-
tor pulls, you should definitely see
some of Pitt’s matches next year. You
might even get on TV.

Pitt News and is embarrassed that
he’s enough of a couch potato to write

MLB

Ron Wright about a year away from the

majors, there’s a bright light piercing through

the dense fog of the upcoming season.
“Stick with us,” says Al Martin. “Good

V things will happen —— later."

Meanwhile, somewhere on the other
side of Pennsylvania...

Like their cross—state rivals, the Pirates,
Philadelphia is entrenched in a rebuilding
phase of their own. The changes, though not
as drastic as Pittsburgh, have occurred
throughout the lineup.

The Philadelphia Phillies hope their

team colors will remain red and white this
year, instead of black and blue ﬁom last
year’s team which was marred by injuries.
Injuries have played a key role in dis-
mantling the olfensive powerhouse of the

' 1993 World Series ﬁnalists.

Star outﬁelder Lenny Dykstra’s come-
back has fallen short because of severe back
problems and slugger Darren Daulton
missed all but one week of last season due to
knee surgery. Also on the Phillies’ disabled
list in ‘96 were outﬁelder Gregg Jelferies,
shortstop Kevin Stocker, catcher Mike
Lieberthal, and pitcher Mike Grace.

Lost to free agency are Benito Santiago,
Jim Eisenreich, Sid Fernandez, Mike
Wﬂharns, David West, Mike Benjamin, and
Russ “Don’t call me Jerry” Springer But the
Phillies, who have a ‘97 payroll of $26.5 mil-
lion, were equally as active in signing ﬁee
agents.

The most notable acquisition is Danny
Tartabull, who ﬁnally settled for a one year
deal worth about $2 million. He ﬁnished last
year with the White Sox hitting .254 with 27
homeruns and 101 RBI. Tartabull will
man right ﬁeld while batting cleanup. The
only other sure spot in the outfield is Gregg
Jefferies (.292, 7 HR, 51 RBI, 20 SB) in left,
if Jeﬁeries can avoid the Phillies disabled list
for the ﬁrst time. Last year tom thumb liga-
ments sidelined the injury—pmne speedster.

Center ﬁeld remains an uncertainty with
ﬁee agent Rex Hudler and young Wendell
Magee vying for playing time. Hudler (.311,
16 HR, 40 RBI, 14 SB) is coming off a
superb year with the California Angels. The
37 year-old, who still runs with exceptional
speed, can also play second base. Magee hit
.204 in a brief stint with the Phils but has

played center in the majority of Grapeﬁuit

League games this spring.

One thing is for certain — the player
who makes the starting lineup will bat lead
off. Ricky Otero, who struggled as the lead
off hitter last season, and Astros castoff
Derrick May will see playing time in the out-
field as well.

The inﬁeld is set with the slick—ﬁelding
Rico Brona (.255, 7 HR, 30 RBI) at ﬁrst,
speedy Mickey Morandini (.250, 3 HR, 32
RBI, 26 SB) at second, hard-nosed shortstop
Stocker (.254, 5 HR, 41 RBI), and minor-
league sensation Scott Rolen handling the
hot comer. Rolen is still a rookie this year,
but just barely. The third baseman ended his
season after being hit by a pitch. At the time,
Rolen had exactly 130 at~bats, one less than
the limit to no longer qualify as a rookie.

 

THE PITT NEWS

Although Rolen hit .254 with four homers
and only 18 RBI, he demolished minor
league pitching (.324, 11 HR, 61 RBI in 106
games).

Both Stocker and Morandini struggled
last year. Stocker was hitting a measly .186
when the Phillies sent him down to Class
AAA Scranton. His double—play partner did-
n’t fare much better. Morandini, the subject
of trade rumors all year long, committed 12
errors and dropped 33 points from his batting
average. In all likelihood, Stocker will begin
the year batting second while Morandini
slides down to the eighth spot in the lineup.

ThePhilliesarededicatedtoBrognaat
ﬁrst base, which limits Daulton to a bench
role. However, Daulton (.249, 9 HR, 55 RBI
in 1995) has expressed interest in being a
designated hitter in the American League,
speciﬁcally for the Baltimore Orioles.
Baltimore has expressed interest in trading

for Daulton, who also has a $5 million salary.

Brogna was traded to the Phils from the
New York Mets after missing most of the
season with shoulder problerrrs. He’ll bat
ﬁfth between Tartabull and Rolen. The
Phillies say they want better power numbers
from Brogna, especially with the loss Benito
Santiago (30 HR) to the Toronto Blue Jays.

Taking over for Santiago at catcher is
former No. 1 draft pick Mike Lieberthal
(.253, 7 HR, 23 RBI). Lieberthal is strong
defensively, but his knees are questionable
after season—ending surgery in August.

Backing up at catcher is veteran Mark
Parent (.226, 9 HR, 23 RBI with Baltimore),
who will provide a power threat off the
bench.

VV1th right—hander Curt Schilling in the
ﬁnal year of his contract, negotiations have
allbutendedandthePhilliesareexpectedto
continue offering Schilling (9-10, 3.19 ERA)

 

as trade bait. The rest of the pitching staff is

‘set with all right—handers.

Free agent acquisitions Mark Portugal
(8-9, 3.98 with Cincinnati) and Mark Leiter
(8-12, 4.92 with Montreal) will join second
year starter Mike Grace (7-2, 3.49) and
another victim of injury Tyler Green (8-9,
5.31 in 1995). ‘

The bullpen is strong with righties Scott
Ruffcom (13 wins in AAA), Ken Ryan
(eight saves, 2.43 ERA) and dominating
closer Ricky Bottalico (34 saves, 3.19) who
struck out 74 batters in 68 innings last year.
However, the, Phillies must ﬁnd a couple of
lefties to ﬁll out the bullpen.

If Philadelphia is to compete with NL
East superpowers Atlanta and Florida, they

must not only play over their heads, but stay .

healthy all season long. And looking back at
the past three seasons with mounting
injuries, that may be too much to ask

Richard “Pip” Overmoyer

1 know as vice-president of GPSA l can make a
difference "at the University while lending my
leadership skills to the student body. I challenge you to
take a chance and vote for the alternative candidate!
What sets me apart is that I bring a different
perspective to student government. I am a part—time
student in the Graduate School of Public and
international Affairs and an employee at the University
of Pittsburgh Medical Center. I share experiences with
many graduate and professional students who are

working while advance their education. These real

world perspectives are needed in an organization such as GPSA and I know I can
represent my peers. My qualifications include four years of progressive
management experience at UPMC. l have coordinated the activities of
departmental teams and have chaired numerous committees. In my career I am
well respected for my problem solving skills and creativity. These two qualities are
what all leaders possess. To the position of vice-president I bring a fresh
perspective, proven leadership skills, and years of experience at Pitt. I think the
role of any student representative is that you must be visible and responsive. I am
dedicated to providing leadership that is- both. I am eager to serve you the
graduate and professional students of this University.
