Cool Students

 Use Cafeteria

For Study Hall

Hot, sticky students will be

' able, through the eﬁorts of Stu-

dent Government and Saga Food
Service, to study in the coolness
of the air-conditioned cafeteria
every week-day evening from 8
p.m. to 11 p.m., starting tonight.
Tonight and tomorrow are trial
periods for the project, which Will
be discontinued if there is little
student support.

According to Richard Dearden,
Manager of Saga Food,Service,
the project is completely in the
hands of the students. “Itfs en-
tirely the students’ responsibility
as to general conduct,” he com-
mented. The salt and pepper
shakers and sugar bowls will be
left on the tables -— and are ex-
pected to remain there. Two S G
monitors will be the only super-
vision present.

The air-conditioning, which is
usually turned off at 9 p.m.
and on again at 6 a.m., will
run as long as students are
studying there.

The cafeteria is being made use

Too -Many ‘Men on the Street’

John Brewer, principal of the :_

Miller Elementary School, said
that delinquency occurs not only
because of an apathetic society,
which all the panelists decried,
but also because there are too

problem. ,

Ray Norr, on leave of absence
as the chief psychologist of the
Juvenile Court of Richmond,
asserted that while it is im-
portant to realize the individ-
uality of the delinquent, it is
necessary to understand the sig-
niﬁcant variable within the
subculture. Norr said that sta-
tistical studies and yardsticks of
predictability are essential if
the problem is to be attacked on
a large scale.

Norr held that social workers
need a tool that can talk in terms
of more than one individual. This
tool will add to the subjective

LETTERSTO THE EDITOR

V'Whee|chair' Editorial

Assaulted By Student
Editor, The Pitt News:

I am writing

. your editorial,

in regard to

“Assistance Re-
quired,” hoping to clear up a
few misconceptions I find in it.
You say that “the (wheelchair)
students themselves state that
they can do most everything on
their own.” Take-our word for
it — we can. And we want to.
Assistance is not required.

It is not the “obligation of the
,University to provide aid for
these students.” Why should the
University provide us with un-
wanted help for our physical

'_ problems? Does it force tutors on

' students" with scholastic pro-

' blems or psychiatrists on those

: with emotional problems?

' As handicapped individuals,
we must make a number of com-
pensations for our disabilities in
order to function effectively in
a normal environment. Some of
the situations we must cope with

may seem rather gruesome to

you. However, there are a num-
ber of reasons I can suggest for
you to swallow your‘ se1f-con-
sciousness and altruism and let

. us handle our own problems.
First of all,
5 measure of ingenuity and deter-
j' mination to learn how to handle
' in our own abnormal way the
,'little normal situations which
3 come up in everyday life. We’l1
- always be faced with such sit-
- uations and someday we may
need that ingenuity and deter-

'mination to literally survive. If

we lean on others now to solve
‘ our problems, what happens
when there’s no one to lean on?
V The worldrbeyond the bor-
ders of this campus is com-
petitive, fast—moving, and often
cruel and selﬁsh. I came to the
. University of Pittsburgh with

. schools,

it takes some

the understanding that I would
be faced with a competitive,
fast-moving situation with all
the pitfalls situation
holds for the handicapped
dividual and I welcomed such a

such a
in-

situation.‘ I was not promised a
h oarh e
with educational beneﬁts.

complete
If I

can survive here my chances for
surviving after I leave are in-
creased. T h e r e are several
including the Univer-
sity of Illinois, with elaborate
special facilities for the handi-
capped. Any student faced with
physical difficulties he cannot
handle in a normal college situa-
tion may enroll at one of them.

I‘am not shy. If I were, I
couldn’t survive. It I need help,
I’ll ask for it. If I don’t ask for
it, I want to be left alone to do
things in my own way, however
peculiar or difficult it may seem.
And that includes everything
from pushing myself up a hill
to providing for my personal
needs in my room. I have lived
with my problems for a long
time and to me they’re as nor-
mal as what to wear or whether
to take any eight o'clock classes
this term. And don’t overlook
the fact that getting oneself out
of a difficult situation is very
often fun and usually rewarding.

Lastly, I demand, from you
and from life the right to fail.
The University does not guaran-
teeanyone who enters it eight

convalescent

trimesters free of problems with .

a degree as a reward for at-
tending classes. I want no such
guarantee either. _“Life’s but a
walking shadow, a poor player
who struts and frets his hour
upon the stage and then is heard
no more.” I ask only that I be
allowed my hour upon the stage
and then be heard no more. I
want neither fanfare for my
victories nor requiem for my

defeats. and
crutches are merely my props. I
do not wish to buy with them
more support from my fellow
actors’, a place in the spotlight,
a kind word from the critics, or
an extra measure of applause.
I don’t object to your writing
the editorial. You wrote it be-
cause you' were trying to help
us; the only trouble is that you
don’t understand. But take”com-

Wheels, braces,

fort in the fact that very few_

people_ do. John Q. Student
looks at an individual in a
wheelchair and sees only that
he is different. Immediately he
wants to know nothing more -
this different individual will not
fit into his comfortable little
circle. He represents a threat to
the security he ﬁnds in having
friends just like himself. John
Q. Student refuses to.see that
we have normal emotions, enjoy
normal things, and even have
normal capabilities. There is an
impassable breach between the
handicapped and non-handicap-
ped students on this campus. It
forces. us to seek out each
other’s ‘company because you
can't seem to ﬁnd any exper-
iences to'share with us. If the
breach ,were not there the un-
derstanding would have been,
and the editorial would not
have been written.

If you still want to crusade
for us, why -not ask for such
practical things as leveling off
the sidewalks in front of Lang-
ley Hall and the Cathedral, a
No Parking sign in front of the
Cathedral crosswalk, or a swing-
ing door into the Cathedral
which can be opened from the
outside? Thank you for your
good intentions, but please be
sure you understand the situa-
tion before you editorialize.

Sage Remarks
Dashing De|Vecchio

By Bob Smizik

Sports Editor

One of the most outstanding performances by a Pitt
athlete this year went by Virtually unnoticed last month.

Tra.ck sprinter Bill DelVecchio, only a good sprinter
during the dual meet season, turned into an outstanding
one during the NCAA Track and Field championships at

‘Albuquerque, New Mexico and took a fourth in the 100—yard
dash and a seventh in the 220—yard dash.

Doing that well in the NCAA track meet is an extraor-
dinary feat. Track is not like gymnastics or wrestling where

only. a comparative handful

.of participants compete and

where it is likewise comparatively easy to place.

Only a Few Can Place ‘

NCAA track competition is like swimming where a mul-

, titude of record-breaking participants seek honors and only a

small handful come out among the ﬁnishers.
An example of this -is in swimming, where Pitt’s Rob and
Ron" Levine could'not place in the NCAA meet, after being

\nearly upstoppable in dual meets.

Tracklis even tougher than swimming because more

schools have track teams.

than swimming teams.‘

v But back to DelVecchio
He did not do much to distin
guish himself during the reg

dash. Outdoors he was beaten
four times in dual meets in

‘the 100-yard dash and failed
,. to place in the Ohio Relays in
i the 1.00.

Yet in the NCAA champ-
ionships, racing
least 20 runners who had

better times than him, he made the ﬁnals in both of his

_ specialties.

Rees said, “I feel that here is a case of an athlete rising

‘to the occasion and being ready for the big one. Each time
Bill was beaten "during the year he learned something and

became more determined to win.” 4 ‘
DelVecchio' ran a 9.4 in the "100" in the quarter-ﬁnals
but the time was not official due to the wind. In the semi-
‘ﬁnals he, posted a 9.6 to tie the school record. In the. 220-
yard dash he broke the_school record in_ the semi-finals

with a time of 21.0.
In the ﬁnals of the 100

j , Dellfecchio led from the 20 to 075
yard mark before being declared the fourth place ﬁnisher in
_a four-way photo ﬁnish,

Rees says that “DelVecchio is not the hardest worker on
theteam,‘ but is very dedicated and conscientious.” Along
with s'peed,.these are qualities that too many members of

Rees’/team lack. -» . ~

15 Teams Bid For Shortstop

By MARV ZELKOWITZ

c Any baseball coach in the :
country would be satisﬁed to E1
have a .400 hitter on his team 

who is a defensive liability.
But a .400 hitter who is a
good ﬁelder is a coach’s

dream. Panther shortstop Al Ric
ciuti is such a blessing.

Ricciuti has all the equipmen
to beta major leaguer, accordin
to his coach, Bobby Lewis. “Al
bert has everything the scout
look for in a ball player,” he said
“He has good size (6-ft., 2-in.
185 lbs.), he’s fast, he hits fo
average, he has good power, and
he has a long stride. He also ha
an accurate throwing arm.

“Since Al is the clean—up hitter
he’s going to look at the best _op
posing pitchers have to offer. He’s
probably looked at more curves
than any other batter on the
team, and he gets jammed on the
ﬁsts a lot more.

- Inside Trouble

“Because of this, he had trouble
hitting the inside pitches that
were strikes,” the coach said. “He
dropped away from the plate a
little bit so he could see the ball
better. He hasn’t had any trouble
since then.”

A New York Met scout saw
the All-District Two shortstop
play and commented: “He’s just
like Joe Cronin was when he
was young. The kid (Ricciuti)
has everything he needs to be a
big leaguer. All he needs is
some good professional coach-
mg.”

Lewis agreed. “Al needs some

reﬁnement in his playing,” the

coach said. “He has to face good_

hitting and good pitching every
day. He doesn’t get a lot of diffi-
cult plays now, and the only way
you can learn how to make them
is to practice them in game situa-
tions.-”
Many Interested

As of now, 15 baseball teams
are willing to give Ricciuti that
chance. The Giants, Los Angeles
Dodgers, Houston Colts,- Minne-
sota Twins, and the Pirates are
among the teams that have shown
interest in the shortstop.

Ricciuti says that he will

‘Winston Churchill’
‘The Conservative Affirmation’

Churchill As Saint

By MATTHEW’SWETONIC

.‘ When an author attempts to
pronounce judgement on the life
of a man while his subject is
still alive, it almost always
works out that the more re-
spected the personality, the more
minute the real criticism which
the writer levels.

In the case of Lewis Broad’s

. s e c o n d volume biography of

England’s most famous prime

minister, entitled W i n s t on
Churchill: The Years of
Achievement (Hawthorn, 629

the author has
approached his subject with the
tenderness of a Roman cardinal
penning a history of the In-
quisition.

His praise is lavish and prac-
tically unceasing and the criti-
cism which he condescends to
level is scanty and almost al-
ways directed away from

. Churchill and at subordinates

who “were never of the same
quality as the Prime Minister.”
The result is a wishy-washy bi-
ography of little actual worth
to the professional historian.
Mere Condensation '

_ Broad has done little more in
the book than take Churchill’s
six volume history of the Second
World War, condense it, switch

' from the first to the third person,

add a smattering of information
about the post-war era, and
then attempt to present the ma-
terial in a prose style so as to
conceal the fact that most of
the book was written by Church-
ill himself.

It is a rare occurance
throughout the book when
more than three pages pass

~ without a 15 or 20 line quote
from Churchill’s history, and
it is even a rarer occurance
when the author allows a
trace of serious criticism to
slip in from outside the Sec-
ond World War sextet.

Still,the biography is fascinat-
ing and highly detailed without
becoming dull. Broad has writ-

ten his condensation cleverly
and has managed to ﬁll in the
little details which Churchill
ommitted in his six volumes by
engaging in some research into
other sources. ’
Why Bother?

Still the question remains, why
reading the life of
Churchill by an outsider when
one can just as easily go to his
autobiography for the same
story? In this case‘ it doesn’t
really make any difference since
historian Broad is just about as

critical of Churchill as Winston

is of himself.

Churchill was certainly a
great man, and perhaps as the
author contends, the greatest
of this century if not of all

' history, but even great men
make some mistakes and the
former Prime Minister of Eng-
land was no exception.

Yalta was a colossal blunder
and his dealings with the Allies
at certain times were all but
brilliant, but Broad has passed
these by with a clever toss of
the head and has left us with a
portrait of a creature more saint
than man, more idealistic than
human.

Conservatism

By THOMAS PLATE

Whether Barry Goldwater
will awake the sleeping Con-
servative beauty, pounce on
Washington with a Lenin-like
coup d’ etat, and wrestle control
from the hands. of those irres-
ponsible “Communists, Anarch-
ists, Radicals, Socialists, and
Liberals,” as William F. Buck-

ley has intimated, is’ a question .

that American voters may well
have a chance to decide in No-
vember of 1964. '

But until th en , "predatory
Conservatives can read Will-
more Kendall’s The Conserva-
tive Aﬁirmation (Chicago: Hen-
ry Regnery Company, 1963, 272
mm).

Kendall, an associate editor
of The National Review blazes
through everybody from Clin-
ton Rossiter, whom Kendall re-
gards in much the same light as
European Communists r e g a r (1
European Socialists — nocom-
promise - to John Stuart Mill,
whom Kendall would allow to
roam around in Conservative
Paradise — but not say a word.

Determined Fierceness
Kendall is ﬁcercely determined

to draw a line between Conser- '

vatives and Liberals that even
General Eisenhower could see.
The line is crucial for Kendall
because he sees it as the even-
tual no-man's land between the
lines of march crystallizing for
a war between the Liberals and
the Conservatives that will make
the warfare of the McCarthy
era look like Paul VI's corona-
tion.

He believes that the real
issue that McCarthy so sauve-
ly ignited is the basic divider
between the prophets of The
National Review and the prop-
hets of The New Republic.
The ultimate issue is the _“open
society.” In terms of classic
philosophy, the issue is‘ over
the validity of John Stuart’
Mill’s On Liberty.

Mill’s tenet is that any idea
should be allowed open expres-
sion in society; that it should re-
ceive equal attention and face
the brunt of contrary opinions.

We’ve Got Truths

Kendall holds that this type of
society is not for us because
America has certain “truths”
that must be held no matter_
what, and that any opinion‘
which seeks to undermine these
truths must. be stomped upon
immediately. W i t h o u t certain
unassailable truths,

exist.

The author chides Mill for
his willingness to allow any

 
 

 

opinion. equal consideration;
for viewing society ,more or
less like a debating club; for
holding an “absurd” relativity
of value. He agrees with Bet-
rand de Jouvenel of the Uni-
versity of Chicago who at-
tempts to discard Mill’s “mor-
al relativism.”

Thusly: neither opinion A not
B, he says of Mill, has any in-
trinsic value; attempts to im-
pose either would be attempts
to impose what has no intrinsic
value; but suppression of either
would be suppresion of what has
no intrinsic value.

Thus, there is no crime in sup-
presing ‘contrary opinions.

Not Another Idea

There is a crime in suppress-
ing contrary opinions, even
- Mill’s, because the opinion, ac-

cording to Kendall’s system, will ‘

be suppressed by another hu-
man being, not another idea.
A The point that Kendall con-
sistently avoids with extreme
adroitness is that just be-
cause ‘there is no absolute
truth ﬂying high above the
American, ﬂag ‘for all to see
_and _cherish does not mean
that there is no truth. VMill’,s
point is to let the truth sup-
press the falsehood, let one
idea ‘annihilate another; let
not one fallible group of hu-
‘man beings go around anni-
hilating what they consider to
be non-truth. /
. He also misses what Alfred
North Whitehead has said in
his Process and Reality,: “A
new idea introduces a new al-
ternative; and we are not less
indebted to a thinker when we

Pub-Frequenters

This thinker may be a Rhodes
scholar like Kendall; he ,may
even be an habitual frequenter
of the. ‘near-by pub. No matter
who thought the idea, its validity
is independent of its author.

Kendall has the annoying
habit of pooh-poohing a prop-
osition without dealing with it
in a manly way.

We must be careful not to
let Kendall andhis‘ associates
make too much noise, lest they
drown out contrary opinions,
which, after all, should be ‘able
to handle the false ones easily.
