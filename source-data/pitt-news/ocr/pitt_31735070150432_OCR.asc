President Barack Obama and Re-
publican presidential nominee Mitt
Romney traded rhetorical j abs over
domestic policy Wednesday eve-
ning during theirﬁrst debate of the
2012 presidential race.

During the 90-minute debate
hosted by CNN at the University
of Denver, Romney and Obama es-
poused their plans on issues rang-
ing from debt reduction to educa-
tion. This was the ﬁrst debate to
take place between the candidates‘
before the Nov. 6 election.

On the issue of their respective
budget plans, Obama frequently
attacked Romney for a lack of speci-
ﬁcity regarding how he’d enact a
budget to reduce the federal debt.
while also reducingtax rates across
the board. E

“And the fact is that if you are
lowering the rates the way you de-
scribed, Governor, then it is not
possible to come up with enough
deductions and loopholes that only
affect high—income individuals,”
Obama said. '

But Romney countered, saying
that Obama’s plan would cripple
small businesses by increasing their.
tax burdens to the point at which

.50 percent of their income would

be paid in taxes. He also said that
his plan “is not like anything that
has been tried before,” because it
reduces the debt while increasing
jobs. , ' .

Romney also blasted Obama for

Bar shut down for failure to pay  tax

Gideon Bradshaw
Staff Wrz'ter

The Allegheny County Sheriif’s Office

closed Pittsburgh Cafe on Wednesday

following an order from the county.
.The Meyran Avenue bar, popular

' with Oakland students, had notpaid

the Allegheny County Alcoholic Bev-
erage Tax since the law took effectin

January2008.Afteracomplaintwas
ﬁled against the bar in March 2009,
the bar was ordered in November
of the same year to pay the county
$12,365.04, accordingto Sgt. Richard
Fersch of the sheriff’s ofﬁce’s civil and
real estate divisions.

Fersch said‘ that as of the closure,
the bar still owed that full amount,
which includes court~ordered ﬁnes
and penalties. The ownership of
Pittsburgh Cafe has until Oct. 23 of
this year to pay the sum in-fulltvor to

work out a payment schedule with
the county.

If it does not meet the deadline,
the bar, along with its liquor license,
will be up for sale that same day.

Fersch added that the sheriff’s of-
ﬁcewas ordered to close other bars in
Allegheny County yesterday in con-
nection with delinquency in regard
to the beverage tax. I-Ie remarked
that the county waited several years
before ordering law enforcement to
take action against the bar.-

“The county was more than ami-
cable in allowing [Pittsburgh Cafe]

ample time to pay what they owed,” A E

Fersch said.

As of 5:45 p.m. Wednesday, the
bar remained closed and unoccu-
pied. Multiple neon orange signs
announced that the bar had been

closed because of afailure to pay the ’

county tax. 5

STUDENT GOVERNMENT

  Election E 

season
kicks off

Megan Trimble
Stqff W riter

As the nation turnsits attention to 

the .U.S. presidential debates, Pitt
‘students have their own election
to focus on — that of the Student
Government Board. 7

Packets for students interested
in becoming an SGB candidate, in-
cluding paper petitions that call for
200 signatures for Board member
candidates and 250 signatures for
Board presidential candidates,
were made available Monday and
are due Oct. 17. The SGB election
will be held on Nov. 15, and stu-
dents will have the opportunity to
vote for ﬁve Board members and a
president. .

Elections Chair Annie Brow
said about 22 students have picked
upthe packets, and a complete list
of those who have accepted packets
is on display at the front desk of
the SGB office in Room 848 of the
William Pitt Union.

Brown said that while some who
accept packets choose not to run,
the Elections Committee is excited
about the turnout and the student
interest in this year’s election.

As long as their packets are
approved after the Oct. 17 packet
deadline, current Board members
Natalie Rothenberger and Gordon
Louderback will be among those
campaigning for the 2013-2014
presidential seat.

Rothenberger said that she is
passionate about being involved
in SGB and looks forward to the

providing $90 billion in tax breaks
toward green energy companies af-
ter the President pointed out the
$2.8 billion in subsidies toward oil
companies. He added that, for the
most part, these companies haven’t
been successful.

“I had a friend who said you
don’t just pick the winners and los-
ers. You pick the losers, all right,”
Romney said.

And in what has become one
of the campaign’s core arguments,
Romney and Obama traded blows
over the issue of whose plan pre-
serves Medicare in its current for-
mat. Obama said under Republi-
can vice presidential nominee Paul
Ryan’s budget plan, Medicare would
transform into a voucher system.

And although Romney claimed
he’d maintain Medicare for those
who need it, Obama said Romney’s
plan could leave senior citizens vul-
nerable.

“Those insurance companies are
pretty clever at ﬁguring out who are
the younger and healthier seniors,”
Obama said. “They recruit them,
leaving the older, sicker seniors in
Medicare.”

Romney argued that Obama’s
Patient Protection and Affordable

Care Act removes $716 bil-
lion from Medicare to ﬁmd
programs within the plan.
Obama also attacked
Romney on his view of the role of
the federal government in public
education, saying the former Mas-
sachusetts governor “doesn’t think
we need more teachers.”
But unlike the President, Rom-
ney said, he stands in favor of a
system in which public education

A is supported at the state and local

levels.

“I reject the idea that I don’t
believe in great teachers or more
teachers,” Romney said. “Every
school district, every state should
make that decision on their own.”

Before closing the debate,
Obama and Romney touched on
their view of the role in government
in society. While Obama saidthe.
government could “open the lad-
ders of opportunity” for Americans
everywhere, Romney said the role
of the government was a simple one.

“The role of the government:
look behind us. The Constitution
and the Declaration of Indepen-
dence. The role of government is
to promote the principles of those
documents,” Romney said.

The two candidates will face
off in a second debate on Oct. 16
at Hofstra University in New York.

role to help others make a differ-
ence on campus.

“I’ve been so fortunate to work
with so many people who have in-
spired me,” Rothenberger said. “I
want to represent the Board and
help them reach out to students.
Over time, the Board has done a
great j ob of evolving and strength-
ening its relationship with stu-
dents, but I want to work to create
a more approachable and more vis-
ible Board than it already is now.”

Rothenberger added that she is
enjoying the process of collecting
signatures. I

“I think what is so great about
it is that you actually get to go out
and talk to students who may not

.,ki1ow what SGB is or how it oper-

ates, and it’s -really great to explain
the process to them and meet new

he is only collecting signatures, the

ects that you can do to change Pitt’s
campus,” Louderback said. “Once
I got the packet in my hand, it be-

are due Oct. 19 and, for the ﬁrst
time, single candidates or single
slates will be able to endorse other
candidates or slates. A slate allows
for a candidate to align with two
other candidatesto represent com-
mon platform initiatives.

Rothenberger said that, while
she could not share names, she does
have a group to run with in mind.

Brown said that upcoming
events for the candidates include
a campaign workshop, which out-
lines the do’s and don’ts of cam-
paigning. Ofﬁcial campaigning,

‘when students begin to solicit

votes and endorsements, begins
on Oct. 25.

“I believe that I would be a great
addition to the Board and would
like to give back to the student
body,” Mallampalli said. “Since I’ve

been working with SGB, I’ve gotten
to know more about the allocations
process and how things run, and
there are deﬁnitely some changes
that I would like to see made with
that.”

N ites said that he would also like
to use his knowledge of the alloca-
tions process to connect students
and the Board.

“Generally speaking, I would
like to have a long—lasting and posi-
tive impact on the student body,”
Nites said. “Right now I’m com-
pleting the packet and choosing

have in mind now.”

Landreneau said that he has had
some of the greatest times as a
Board member and Board presi-
dent, and while collecting signa-
tures and campaigning present
their stresses, that it is a great way
to hear from students.

“My recommendation for the
candidates right now is not to freak
out and to remain calm. Even dur-
ing campaigning season, things
have a tendency to work themselves
out even if at the time you seem to
have a lot on the plate,” Landreneau
said. “This stage really helped me
to shape what goals and projects I
decided to run on.”

p e Halting the voter ID law is a
9 start, but let’s Work to overturn it

Rosie McKinley
Columnist

Good news Pennsylvania: With a
judge’s halting of the new voter
ID law, we will have democracy
restored.

Perhaps -when our state leg-
islature declared this the “Year
of the Bible” — so much for the
separation of church and state -
we should have expected 2012 to
bean embarrassing time to be a
Pennsylvanian. To the rest of the
nation, we have become a state
deﬁned by ugly and embarrassing
incidents.

There’s -been the contentious
environmental issue of fracking.
We gave national late—night talk
show hosts a wealth of comedic
material by offering up our very
own Rick Santorum, a presidential
candidate so outrageous he auda-
ciously compared homosexual-
ity to bestiality. Most n0tably,.our
ﬂagship collegiate football team
was mired in the biggest scandal
in sporting history. ‘

‘Needless to say, it is time for
some positive Pennsylvania pub-

licity. The halting of the highly
controversial voter ID law passed
in May of this year is exactly that
good press.

Ever since its passage into law,
this restriction of voting has been
carefully scrutinized — and often
ridiculed — by legal experts from

across the country. Groups nearly.

synonymous with voters’, rights,
like the NAACP and ACLU, have
openly criticized the law. And
with Tuesday’s halting of the law,
Pennsylvania regains some pride.

But the law has not been
thrown out; its implementation
has merely been delayed until af-
ter this election. ~

So if the law is getting halted’

before the election, why was it
ever enacted in the ﬁrst_ place,
and why should we demand’ it be
overturned for future elections
as well? A
Republicans claim the law is
an attempt to block voter fraud.
According to the GOP, Pennsylva-
nia needs to make voting more re-
strictive to prevent voting abuses.
If voting fraud in Pennsylvania
sounds like news to you, it should.

Pennsylvania doesn’t actually have
a voting fraud problem.

Whenpressed in an interview
with National Public Radio, Rep.
Daryl Metcalfe, R—Butler County,
who championed the bill, could
only cite one minor voting fraud
offense. According to Metcalfe,
once in 1999 a man was prosecut-
ed for breaking absentee voting
rules. Even the bill’s major propo-
nent struggled to argue why this
law was necessary. In short, voter
fraud is a Republican construct.

It is as though Metcalfe and
the bill’s other supporters are
suggesting we take an expensive
trip to the doctor’s office, fear-
ing we have a life—threatening
illness even though we have no
symptoms. Or imagine if Pitt were
to suddenly require us to bring
multiple forms of identiﬁcation to
ﬁnals even though there is neither
a threat nor a history of cheating
scandals here.

Even if there were evidence of
voting law violations, a restrictive
voter ID law would soon become

outdated. In the 2008 presidential election,
25 percent of voters used absentee ballots.
One voting expert predicts that number
could rise to a third of all voters this year.
If you are ﬁlling out an absentee ballot —— as
a signiﬁcant portion of voters do — you do
not need voter ID.

So if there is no history or imminent
threat of voter fraud, and if voter ID re-
quirements will become outdated as the use
of absentee ballots increases, what exactly
does a stricter voter ID policy accomplish?

The voter ID law disenfranchises an esti-
mated 100,000 eligible Pennsylvania voters
simply on the grounds that they do not have

approved IDs. Those Pennsylvanians are _

disproportionately likely to be minorities
from urban and impoverished areas who
are more likely to vote Democratic. As Rep.
Mike Turzai, R—Allegheny County, happily
stated, the Pennsylvania voter ID bill was
to “allow Gov. [Mitt] Romney to win the
state of Pennsylvania.”

Similarly to other Republicans, Metcalfe
has labeled Pennsylvanians prevented from
voting by the law as “too lazy” to get the
proper identiﬁcation. Now, I don’t know
when the last time was that you had to go
to the DMV or deal with bureaucracy gener-
ally, but you can count on it to be time-con-
suming, ineﬂicient and confusing. Republi-
cans understand the annoyance of working
with the government. That’s why they claim
to be guardians against big government

If voting fraud in
— Pennsylvania sounds
like news to‘you, it
should. Pennsylvania
doesn’t actually
have a voting fraud
problem.

and increased government regulation. As

Metcalfe states on his website, “since being
elected to ofﬁce in 1998, I have fought for
limited, more efficient government.”

Why the sudden contradiction? Metcalfe
and other Republicans know that increasing
government bureaucracy through stricter
voting laws makes voting more difﬁcult and
disproportionately discourages minorities
and those living in poverty from voting.

Pennsylvania is a proud state. The GOP
should be ashamed for politicizing‘our elec-
tions and knowingly marginalizing thou-
sandsof eligible voters across the state with
the goal of getting their presidential candi-
date elected. As Pennsylvanians, we should
celebrate that the law has been halted and
demand that it be overturned entirely. I

If you’ve ever read Stephen Chbosky’s
coming-of-age novel “Perks of Be-
ingaWallﬂower,” then you probably
understand why my ’80s—altema-
tive—rock glands were salivating the
entire way to the theater to see its
movie adaptation when it premiered
in Pittsburgh this weekend. And if
you’ve seen the movie, you probably
understand why I was so disappoint-
ed by the entirely underwhelming
usage of the soundtrack.

The purpose of a soundtrack is
to guide viewers through the ﬁlm.
A soundtrack should shape their
emotional reactions to whatever is
happening on screen in an organic
way that allows them to access a level
of meaning than what would have
been possible given the ﬁlm’s»visual
aspects alone. A soundtrack should
harmonize perfectly with the ﬁlm it
accompanies, complementing and
resonating with the melody of the
ﬁlm itself and producing a work of
artwith depth and layers of complex-
ity. It is a tall order for any director,
but some manage to pull it oif with
startling facility. Others allow the
music to simply fade into the back-
ground.

The “Perks” track list isn’t bad
— it includes the necessary Smiths,
Sonic Youth and David Bowie tracks
alongside a few lesser-known gems.
Chbosky has good taste, but the
problem is that the soundtrack could
have been great. For the main char-
acter Charlie — as with the rest of
us modern teenagers — music has
a huge impact on his coming of age
and became a sort of lens through
which he sees the world.

But contrary to the high hopes of
music—loving fans, the soundtrack
that Chbosky used felt like more of an
afterthought than the integral part
of the ﬁlm that it could have been.

Those are the most unforgettable
soundtracks: the ones that are so
necessarily tied to the ﬁlm that you

ALBUM REVIEW

Pill Hill’s album represents

blend of experienced inﬂuences

Hannah Webb
S tqff Writer

Pill Hill ‘
Pi/_I Hill
Grade: B

Rocks like: Elliott Smith

After taking a few years off from the music
scene, Dan Fowlds makes a strong return
with his band’s self-titled album, Pz'// Hz‘//.
Working alongside collaborator Ian Prince,
Fowlds recorded and produced a mellow
post-grunge record. .

Combining Fowlds’ experienced tech-
nique on the electric guitar with Hannah
Kennedy on the violin and Mark Vandermyde
on the organ, Pill Hill creates an unusually
pleasant blend of sounds, reminiscent of
artist Elliott Smith.

In the opening song of the album, “Every-
thing is Yours,” Fowlds shows off his excel-
lent vocal harmonies and an upbeat mix of

pop and alternative that hints at inﬂuences
from hugely popular rock bands such as The
Rolling Stones and Radiohead.

But the album is not entirely cheerful.

‘ Some of the tracks are marginally depress-

ing, and their somber tones might appeal to
more emotional listeners.

Fowlds shows his listeners his senti-
mental side in a few tracks. In “Did We Go
Wrong,” for example, Pill Hill evokes a mel-
ancholy mood, using strong piano chords

The group’s success in blending the un-
likely combination of electric guitar, piano,
organ and violin seems to transcend cat-
egorization in any speciﬁc genre.’ Fowlds
reinforces the positive reputation‘of inde-
pendent record companies with his album’s
high-quality and crisp production.

Although his wavering voice and un-
abashed longing for an absent lover might
suggest a questionable end result in the
band’s new album, Fowlds pulls it all to-
gether in a sophisticated manner that shows
off his experience in the music industry. I

applied to new songs.

But that doesn’t mean the album has
no worth. Mumford 8: Sons ﬁlls Babel with
many tracks that emulate a similar sound
to older music but maintain merit on their
own. Songs such as “I Will Wait” and “Hol-
land Road” sound exactly like tracks from
Sigh No More, but both songs beneﬁt the
new album individually.

“I Will Wait,” the album’s ﬁrst official
single, mimics upbeat tracks like “The
Cave” with inspiring lyrics and musical
lulls that fall dramatically into powerful
banjos. Other tracks, such as “Hopeless
Wanderer,” take on the same melancholic
angst that balladic tracks from Sigh No
More resonated.

The band hit its peak a year after Sigh
No More’s release, when every teenage
girl used lyrics from “Little Lion Man” as
her Facebook page status. Dedicated fans
lingered while Mumford 8: Sons gradually
released tracks that ended up on Babel,

despite their antiquity. But instead of using ~

the band’s fame to expand and diversify its
sound, Mumford 8: Sons chose to remain
comfortable in the ﬂourishing sound of
string instruments and whining voices over
clanging music.

And Mumford &‘Sons’ style still works
well. The folk-rock band established a dis-
tinct sound among a radio of pop divas, and
its popularity leaked from the underground

scene into more mainstream spheres. Lis-

teners enjoyed the not—so—average music
the band claimed as its own, and because
of that, Mumford 8: Sons surely capitalizes
on itssuccess. .

For fans who look to the new album as
an extension of Mumford 8: Sons’ debut
album, Babel will be the perfect continu-
ance of something that should have been
left in the past. I

tion, and whether they showcase the work of
a single artist or various musicians, they all
use music as a backbone, a thematic element
of the ﬁlm or just as the emotional and tonal
guide for their viewers. V

The most successful integrations of ﬁlm and
soundtrack will result in an inseparable bond
between song and scene, where the song you

heard becomes irrevocably tied to that scene,
character or work as a whole. What comes to
mind when you hear,“Don’t You Forget About

Me”? Exactly my point.

Some of the best soundtracks are those
featuring just one artist, like the “Superﬂy”
soundtrack by Curtis Mayﬁeld. Other promi-

nent examples are movies such as “The Gradu- .

ate” featuring songs by Simon _& Garfunkel
and “Harold and Maude” featuring Cat Ste-
vens. And, of course, there is The Beatles’ “A
Hard Day’s Night.” A major advantage of the

the effortless continuity of tone. The vocalist
becomes somewhat of a narrator throughout
the ﬁlm, a familiar voice to guide you through
events and allow you to experience the char-

The music needs to ﬁt the mood, such as
when Benjamin’s romantic dreams crumble

from the ﬁlms with music written deep into
their storyline. Anyone that has ever seen “O
Brother, Where Art Thou?” cannot help but
notice that it is as much a story about the de-
velopment and rise of Americana music as
it is about Homer’s “The Odyssey” or life in
the South. The ﬁlm is also rife with only par-
tially obscured references to the country music
greats of old. Just put “O Brother’s” ﬁctional
Soggy Bottom Boys next to the o1d—time blue-

grass Foggy Mountain Boys if you weren’t sure.

Featuring old classics by the likes of Ralph
Stanley and “1VIan of Constant Sorrow,” the
ﬁlm managed to bring appreciation of old-time
country to a whole new generation while still
employing the track list in a way that helped
the audience emotionally process the ﬁlm’s
events: Cue a chilling, a cappella rendition of
“O Death” just as the three main characters are
lining up to be hanged at a Klu Klux Klan rally.

Similar to the way in which _“O Brother”
encompassed early 20th-century country mu-
sic and southern life, “Perks” could have been
the movie testament to growing up in the ’9os,
feeling disenﬁanchised by high school peers
and listening to emotionally charged and con-
templative bands. It could have reimagined the
Smiths “Asleep” for a whole new generation of
kids, letting them appreciate the music with
the same emotion that Charlie did on his ﬁrst

mixtape. Instead, the ﬁlm left music to play in _

background, leaving us looking fondly back on
“The Graduate” OST for all of our heartbroken
growing-up needs. 3

not arranging the portraits in chronological
order. Instead, she decided to arrange them
in a visual manner, in an effort “to have people
engage with each individual painting, looking
at them for what they are.” In this sense, the ‘
HAA department was able to include a histori-
cal contribution to the 225th anniversary.
The combination of both history and ar-
tistic individuality makes the portraits of the
chancellors such an intriguing exhibit. Janet
McCall, avisitingprofessor and director of the
Society for Contemporary Craft, believes that
“these portraits are fascinating time capsules
that can be ‘read’ over time. When you look
at these portraits of leaders, you reﬂect on
what their hopes and aspirations were for the
University during their tenure and how the
"artists attempted to convey those aspirations.”
In addition to their ability to combine art
with history, the portraits literally put names
to faces as the title of the exhibit implies. While
walking through the gallery, people will be
quick to recognize many names with previous
chancellors such as Wesley Posvar, William
Jacob Holland, Edward H. Litchﬁeld and Hugh
Henry Brackenridge, all of whom have build-
ings named after them. . .
The exhibit allows the entir Pitt commu-
nity to not only put faces to names, but to re-
ﬂect on the contributions that these men had
in creating the University as we know it. I

The onslaught continued after the

score four more goals. Pitt managed
just 11 total shots, only four of which
were on goal, to ND’s 36 and 16 on

Disappointing end to‘ season masks Pirates’ potential

Nate Barnes
Staﬁ Wrz'ter

On April 7th, I went to PNC Park to
watch the Pirates play the Phillies.
That night, the game ended when
Alex Presley beat out a grounder to
shortstop Jimmy Rollins in the 10th
inning to bring Michael McKenry
home for a walk-off inﬁeld single.
Even though it was April, and the

,__ ‘ game-winning hit wasn’t as trium-

phant as a double into the gap or a
home run, I believed that night there
was something special about the 2012
Pittsburgh Pirates.

A few weeks ago, I wrote a col-
umn claiming the Pirates would end

’ ”' up “just ﬁne” and in the thick of the

.,;r,

postseason race at the end of the sea-
son. Obviously Iwas wrong, andl can
admit that.

I also said on my weekly radio
show that if the Pirates missed the
playoffs, it wouldn’t matter if they
ﬁnished above .500 this year. I stand
by that claim, but with the Pirates
ﬁnishing under .500 (79-83), 1 ad-
mit it would’ve been nice to see them

   

end theirzo-year—longlosing—season
streak, the longestin NorthAmerican
professional sports history.

But regardless of the atrocious
September collapse, I don’t believe
the Pirates have played a better sea-
son of baseball since their last win-
ning year in 1992. At any given point
throughout the last 20 years, these

Pirates held their record at 16 games
over.500. That is until late August
when the wheels began to fall off, and
they posted the most season wins in
20 years with 196 games.

A lot of great things happened
with this year’s edition of the team.
The aforementioned collapse cer-
tainly disappointed a lot of fans, es-

COLUMN

NFL
losing its
attraction

Pat McAteer
Staff Wrz'ter

Call me crazy, but I’m having trouble
ﬁnding my passion for the NFL this
season.

A few years ago, this notion
would have seemed absurd to me.
I played football for ﬁve years and
still reminisce about it constantly.
I’ve also watched my favorite team,
the Pittsburgh Steelers, win two
Super Bowls and lose a third in the
last decade.

But this year, I’m apathetic. And it
all begins with the hypocrisy of NFL
Commissioner Roger Goodell’s re-
fusal to budge on the NFL referee col-
lective bargaining agreementbefore
it was ﬁnally negotiated last week.

Goodell, who ﬁned Steelers
outside linebacker James Harrison
$125,000 in the 2010 season alone
for his use of illegal tackles, wouldn’t
accept a CBA that would’ve given the
referees minor concessions. .

So despite his rhetoric of action

. and discipline against hits that result

in head injuries, Goodell allowed a
crop of replacement referees —-
whose members include former
NCAA Division III and Lingerie Foot-
ball League oﬂicials — ofﬁciate the
highest level of a sport that is already
under ﬁre for its lack of player safety.

Unsurprisingly, the gridiron
reverted to anarchy. Take, for in-
stance, the Steelers’ Week 2 matchup
against the Oakland Raiders. As he
jumped to catch a pass in the end
zone, Raiders wide receiver Darrius
Heyward—Bey received ablow to the
chin, courtesy of Steelers defensive
back Ryan Mundy’s helmet.

Before he even hit the turf, Hey-
ward-Bey was unconscious. He left
the ﬁeld on a stretcher, and, to the
crowd’s relief, indicated he was OK
with a thumbs—up.

But the referees did not throw a
penalty ﬂag in the end zone.

The call was as clear as day.
Mundy drove his face mask into
Heyward—Bey’s chin as the receiver
sprinted across the ﬁeld and nearly
decapitated fellow Steelers safety
Ryan Clark in the process.

FROM G 

he burst onto the national scene despite his
All-Star appearance in 2011 and made himself a
household name by putting on ahistoric display
of hitting prowess injune andjuly.

In May, june and July, McCutchen posted
averages of .360, .370 and an astounding .446
respectively, with his average peaking at .373
on Aug. 1. Despite hitting .252 and .260 in the
ﬁnal two months of this season, McCutchen still
ﬁnished as one of the National League’s leading
hitters with an average of .327, 31 home runs, 96
runs batted in, and an on-base plus a slugging
percentage of .954.

He also led the National League in the hits
department at 193.

His 7.1 wins—above—replacement rating and
his value to the Pittsburgh organization also
show McCutchen’s merit as a league superstar.
McCutchen is trailed only by San Francisco Gi-
ants catcher Buster Posey’s by a 10th of apoint,
at 7.2 atop the National League. P

In additionto witnessing their star’s break-
out year, Pirate fans caught a glimpse of the
power—packed potential of Pedro “El Toro” Al-
varez. Playinghis first season as afull—time third
baseman since making it to the majors in2010,
Alvarez rewarded the organization’s patience
with 30 home runs, each of which traveled an
average distance of 407 feet.

Despite his high strikeout totals and subpar
batting average of .245, Alvarez showed his po-
tential as a cleanup hitter for years to come with
his home run total and 85 RBI this year.

Another one of Pittsburgh’s young budding
stars, Neil Walker, also made great strides this
year. The Pittsburgh native hit .280 with 14
home runs and 69 RBI and established himself
as one of the best ﬁelding second basemen in
the league.

     

Starling Marte, regarded as one ofbaseball’s ‘

prospects, also showed promise this season.
Marte immediately announced his arrival to the

big leagues with a home run against Houston in
his ﬁrst at bat.

James McDonald is another source of op-
timism. He was arguably the best pitcher in
the National League for the ﬁrst few months
of the season. McDonald owned a 9-3 record
behind a 2.37 earned run average prior to the
Al1—Star Break.

But McDonald — like the Pirates — col-
lapsed after the break, going 3-5 with a7.52 ERA
before manager Clint Hurdle yanked him from
the starting rotation in September.

Speaking of pitching, the resurgence of
35-year-old A.]. Burnett was arguably the best
story of this year’s team. Aftertwo terrible sea-
sons spent as a New York Yankee, Bumett’s fresh
start resulted in a 16-10 record and a 3.43 ERA
with 177 strikeouts. 7

More importantly, Burnett became not only
the ace of the Pirates’ pitching staff, but also the
leader of this young team and will hopefully be
back in Pittsburgh.

I’m aware I used the word potential and its

, synonyms quite ‘often in this diatribe of faith’ to

the Pittsburgh Pirates. Right now, that’s really
all this team has. i '

But more so than at any point in the last 20
years, I think the team is on the verge of real-
izing its potential.

I ﬁrmly believe management will not trade
away the team’s young cogs as it has in the past
and will continue to make moves thatwill beneﬁt
the team inthe future. Neal Huntington turned

Brad Lincoln and Gorkys Hernandez into Travis ,

Snider and Gaby Sanchez at this year’s trade
deadline, two players who will have an impact
on the future of this organization.

With that being said, the onus falls on the

‘Pirates fan base. If there were ever atime to rally

behind this franchise, it’s now. There were a lot
of great moments this season, andl know there
will be more next season.

Manywill call me crazy, and I can understand
why, but I still believe in the Pittsburgh Pirates.
And I believe baseball is back in Pittsburgh. I

MCATEER

This is only one example of the NFL and its

. franchise owners placing proﬁt over the lives

and welfare of their employees, but Goodell
and the NFL owners comprise only a fraction
of my recent qualms with the league.

After former NFL linebacker Junior Seau
committed suicide this summer — a death
some experts attribute to his numerous head
injuries — Ibegan to place more focus on each
tackle I saw. I now wonder whether an injury
suffered by a player during a game will affect
him later in life. It’s reached the point where the
ﬁnal score of the game is only a minor detail.

And it all leads me to a single question: Will
the NFL exist in 50 years? A few years ago, I
would’ve scoffed at the question. But now it
seems like a very real possibility.

In fact, I could imagine the NFL fading into
obscurity as professional boxing has. Before
the rise of the NFL and the NBA, boxing was
king. Athletes like Muhammad Ali andjoe Fra-

zier dominated the headlines of newspapers’

sports sections. They became national icons.
But the brutality of the sport soon reared
its ugly head. Today, All, who’s considered one

of the greatest boxers of all time, suffers from -

Parkinson’s disease, a common occurrence
among those who have suffered repeated head
trauma. 7

As a result, Ali can no longer talk and strug-
gles with movement. He’s become a symbol
of boxing’s brutal side effects. Because of the
post-career ailments of Ali and other boxers,
the next generation of athletes decided, for
the most part, to pursue sports like football,
baseball and basketball rather than subject
themselves to a daily beating.

Now, the sport of boxing is a shadow of
its former self. And the NFL could soon join
it. Over the past year, I’ve heard former NFL
players as well as other people I’ve met say
they wouldn’t allow their son to play football
under any circumstance because of the sport’s
inherent dangers.

And although I would’ve hated myselffor
saying this only two years ago, I agree with
them. ﬁ
