Students seek
space for
Oakland thrift
shop

Lauren Rosenblatt
Staﬁ’ Writer

A group of students in the business of
hand—me—downs needs a place to set up
shop.

The University of Thriftsburgh, an on-
going effort to create a student—run thrift
store on Pitt’s campus, recently gained
popularity through the work of six stu-
dents and a teaching assistant. The stu-
dents came up with the idea for the shop
earlier this semester and will initially rely
on donations collected through other or-
ganizations’ drives on campus.

The initiative evolved from a group
project in a sustainability class through
Pitt’s Department of Geology and Plan-
etary Science. The six project members
teamed up with teaching assistant Shannon
Achille, a junior rehabilitation science ma-
jor, to design an environmental initiative
based on their personal interests.

The University of Thriftsburgh plans
to receive a portion of leftover items from
today’s Swap—A—Palooza, a one-day event at
which students exchange used belongings
on the William Pitt Union Lawn. Swap-
A-Palooza is co—run by Free the Planet,
an environmental group that supports a

A group of “Harry Potter” fans decided
over plates of fries at Market Central
that they wanted to give back to the
community to honor the book series
that had given so much to them.

By combining their passions for
J.K. Rowling’s fantasy novels with
their desire to help others, three co-

presidents created Pitt Project Pot-
ter, an organization that fuses “Harry
Potter”—themed service projects and
philanthropy to raise money for St.
Jude Children’s Research Hospital.
St. Jude is a foundation dedicated to
ﬁnding cures for and preventing cata-
strophic pediatric diseases. The group
became registered with the Student Or-
ganization Resource Center last month.

“We were surprised that there

Lola Adebiyi, co—president ofthe club.

med major, along with fellow sopho-
mores and co-presidents Amy Ta-

variety of causes on campus, and Alpha
Phi Omega, a service fraternity.

Free the Planet and Alpha Phi Omega
collected donations for the swap from bins
that were placed in 14 dorms across cam-
pus over the last week for its annual event,
which aims to recycle and reuse unwanted
items rather than throw them away.

Nicolette Diehl, a member of Alpha
Phi Omega, said Swap-A-Palooza collects
anything it can — including clothes, books
and lamps.

“We want people to think about what
they are doing with their stuff,” Diehl said.
“It’s not much of an effort to walk down
the hall to one of the bins to help a good

cause.”

The store’s location has also yet to be
determined.

The group would prefer to open a shop
on campus, project member and junior
environmental science major Paul Hef-
fernan said, but other members recognize
that space is limited.

Dan Takoushian, a senior environ-
mental studies major also involved in the
project, said the group has encountered
difiiculty ﬁnding a space on campus to ac-
commodate its store. The members plan
to schedule a meeting with Pitt’s admin-
istrators, but they’re also keeping their
options open.

The project members are looking at a
range of places within Oakland, including
the City Reformed Presbyterian Church
on Fifth Avenue and Community Human
Services, a social work organization with

. locations throughout Pittsburgh. '

“We have a resolution to give to Dean
[of Students Kathy] Humphrey and a_ busi-
ness plan ready, so we’ll be able to get
started at a moment’s notice,” Takoush-
ian said.

For Heffernan, the University of
Thriftsburgh will offer a year-round op-
tion for students to buy and sell items. If
and when it opens, the group plans to keep
the store open to community members, as

‘well as college students.

"‘One main goalis to be accessible at
all times. If people only have one event to
recycle and reuse their old items, you’re

not really serving them the best you can,”

Heffernan said.

According to another project member,
Alison Sutch, thrift stores encourage con-
sumers to become more conscious of how
their clothing is made.

“There are a lot of things messed up
with the textile industry, such as workers’
rights violations, pollution problems and
so much more that people aren’t aware
of,” Sutch said. “Thrift stores encourage
people to think about where their clothes
come from and see the whole life cycle of

. the garmen .’’A -

The store will initially be donation-
based, Sutch said, but will hopefully switch
to operating on a system of ‘swapping or
buying and selling clothing items once the
store builds a starting inventory.

Once the store starts buying and sell-
ing items,’ the project members plan to

«donate proﬁts to the University or the Pitt
. Green Fund, a student—controlled fund

that supports any creative sustainability

Mohamed, a sociology and pre—med
major, hope to officially launch the
club next semester, which has not ac-
cumulated any startup costs. thus far.

‘ Though the group is relatively new
with only three members, the found-
ers -have already started spreading the

~ word through social media and are de-
vising a number, of other advertising

tactics. The cover photo on_Pitt Project
Potter’s Facebook page plays off the
series’ most popular taglines: “We sol-
emnly swear that we’re coming to the
University of Pittsburgh.”

Some of their ideas to gain public-
ity include writing on sidewalks with
chalk and posting “undesirable” post-
ers, Adebiyi added. These posters fea-
ture criminals wanted by the Ministry

of Magic (the governing body of the

magical world) in the series, and are
equivalent to “most wanted” posters
in the muggle, or non—magical, world.

According to Tavares, the club will

mainly hold fundraisers, biweekly
meetings and volunteering events.
The club plans to raise funds with
events that mirror its theme, including
“Harry Potter” movie nights, auctions
for “Harry Potter” merchandise and a
Yule Ball, which is a traditional gala in
the series held on Christmas Day that
celebrates the Triwizard Tournament,
a contest between the three largest
European wizarding schools. At Pitt,
muggles, or non—magical people, will
be invited to the Yule Ball, as well.
The club will also sort members

into houses, Mohamed said, which,

is similar to how the Sorting Hat in
the books determines to which house
— Gryffindor, Slytherin, Hufflepuff
or Ravenclaw — first—year students
at Hogwarts will belong during their
stay at the school. Then, members can
earn points for their houses based on
meeting attendance and assistance at
events. ,

“We think that the friendly compe-
tition will motivate members to raise
more money and participate more,”
Mohamed said. “At the end ofthe year,

the house with the most points will win
the house cup.”

In terms of short—term goals, the
club members plan to appoint students
to positions as officers and heads of
houses. According to Tavares, the final
day to send in applications for a leader-
ship position is April 11.

Anthony Deluca, a junior pre—med
and emergency medicine major, is
running for the position of activities
liaison, which includes responsibili-
ties such as helping the president with
fundraising ideas and other activities.

“The ‘Harry Potter’ series was a
part of my life since I was in second

grade and ran around my house with T

a cloak and a broom,” Deluca said. “It
helped me through a lot of hardships
as a child. A true world to escape from
all the bullies and other childhood ob-
stacles.”

Lori Campbell, lecturer and aca-
demic advisor in the English depart-
ment, is the faculty advisor for the
club. Campbell teaches and studies
subjects including fantasy, romance,
myth, folklore and the gothic imagina-

tion, so the club is “a natural tie—in with
[her] teaching and research interests.”

The club’s appeal to the generation
most familiar with the “Harry Potter”
series, Campbell said, will contribute
to its success.

“Students who are interested in the
club now have grown up with Harry

and his friends,” she said. “That kind
of _thin'g__will=' c_ontinue witgheach. new

group of=incc3fni3ng co‘llege=.stu'dents'.”
The three co—presidents agree that
the club should stay relaxed and fun
and function as a place where “Harry
Potter” fans can discuss the books and
movies with other people who appre-
ciate them. They want to keep their
passion for the series involved with
their leadership of the club.
Mohamed, who was born in Egypt,
moved to the United States in 2001
when she was 6 years old and credited
the “Harry Potter” series with helping
her adjust to living in a new country.“I
had trouble learning the language and
feeling comfortable,” Mohamed said.
“It wasn’t until I started reading ‘Harry
Potter’ that I began to excel in English.”

initiatives on campus.

The group has found that most stu-
dents are very enthusiastic about the idea.
Through tabling, Facebook groups, Twit-
ter campaigns and petitions, the members
have obtained roughly 700 signatures in
support of the project.

Anna Greenberg, a freshman environ-
mental studies major, said she pursued

the project because she wanted to par-
ticipate in a big collection event, but since
there are already so many on campus, she
wanted to put her efforts into something
different.

“Most students think it’d be really cool
and are really excited about it. A lot of
people have asked how to get involved,”
Greenberg said.

According to Heffernan, other clubs
—— including Alpha Phi Omega, Free the
Planet and Americans for Informed De-
mocracy — have shown interest in being

involved, as well.

“One goal is to bring together all these
different projects and organizations that
have similar goals. So far, the other clubs
have been very supportive and helpful,
giving us tips from their experiences,”
Sutch said. i ‘

Heffernan said the group hopes to
transform this project into a club to sus-
tain its goals in the long—term.

He is hopeful that the group’s ideas
will come to fruition soon.

“Hail to thrift,” he said. I

Report on climate change presents

Nick Voutsinos
Columnists

“Severe, pervasive and irreversible.”
These are some of words used by the
United Nations’ Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in
its latest report chronicling climate
change. .

This particular report, “Climate
Change 2014: Impacts, Adaptation
and Vulnerability,” has ofﬁcially

V changed the tone of the discussion

on global warming. We have ap-
parently moved past the warnings
of what could happen to complete
urgency. As Saleemul Huq, a lead
author of one of the chapters in
the report, stated, “Before this, we
thought we knew this was happen-
ing, but now we have overwhelming
evidence that it is happening and
it is real.” ’
Accordingto the report, there is
“high conﬁdence” amongthe panel

of experts that human-induced cli- .

mate change will cause more large-
scale and potentially permanent
changes to the world, particularly
the oceans and the ice caps. This
means that sea levels will rise, ex-
treme weather occurrences will
increase and many marine species
and coral reefs will vanish.

And all ofthese outcomes have
the potential to be devastating for
coastal communities and cities,

especially those that are severely

underdeveloped or ridden with

novelty-

Yet the point of the report is,
again, not to give us warnings.
Rather, the objective is to inform
governments that we are indeed liv-
ingin a rapidly changingworld. And
what do species do in response to a
changing environment? To survive,
they adapt. And that is exactly what
the report advises we do.

Still, adaptation is not a ﬁnal so-
lution. Adapting to climate change
does not have to be as radical as dis-

challenges, requires paradigm shift

placing entire human populations
as a result of ﬂoods and droughts.
We can slow down the rate of
change, but as much as it has been
said before, this will‘ require com-
prehensive change.

This means we need a shift in the
way we think about climate change.
The apocalyptic tone of the report
certainly helps to change this para-
digm; scare tactics are usually an
effective way to motivate people
toward action. The U.S. media, for
instance, is no stranger to this tech-
nique. Aside from that, if passion
requires a little bit of frightened
energy, then by all means incor-
porate it.

Many modern cities around the
world are already getting the hint.
For instance, NewYork Cityhas pre-
sented amulti—billion-dollar plan to
protect the city from the next Hurri-
cane Sandy. Some plans involve the

construction of tidal barriers and ocean walls
to prevent rising sea levels and subsequent
ﬂooding. Still, not every area of the world has
the resources necessary to adequately adapt.

Many poverty-stricken areas, especially
those located on coastlines, simply do not
have the funds to protect themselves from
truly devastating weather events. Further-
more, many people living on the coast rely on
ahealthy ocean fortheir livelihoods. Adapta-
tion simply isn’t a feasible option for them.
Contrary to popular belief, this isn’t natural
selection at work. We caused this, and it’s up
to us to alleviate it.

In order to curb emissions as quickly as
possible, we need go after those who control
environmental policy. What needs to be done
is analogous to what has been done in other
political movements. Initially, it may seem du-
bious. Take the tea party, for instance. Strictly
in terms of their rise to prominence, the tea
party grew out of grass—roots movements
involving people who were genuinely fearﬁil
of a “big government.”

April 4, 2014 | The Pitt News I \/v\AAA/.pit’mevvs.com

They started at local levels, mobilizingvot-
ers and resources to their cause via extensive
outreach campaigns, and it was incredibly
effective. They appealed to people’s anxieties
and generated enough strength in numbers to
hold politicians accountable for not conform-
ing to their agenda, as was demonstrated in
the 2010 midterm elections.

Although their agenda is controversial
— something I am not touching on in this
column —— a similar strategy canbe pursued

with climate change. Environmental policy V

needs to start at the local level. It needs to
appeal to the average voter’s concerns via
grass—roots movements and then mobilize
citizens to call for the enactment of policy
focused on curbing emissions. Grass—roots
movements can serve as the link between
global organizations — The IPCC, for in-
stance — and common citizens. This means
that these organizations can monitor global
policy issues and then transmit the infor-
mation to the electorate. It is ‘essential that
any environmental movement keep the same
apocalyptic tone as the IPCC report and even
the tea party.

An extreme tone is needed for such a
pervasive issue, and on top of that, any envi-

ronmental movement will be going against
the wealthiest lobbyists in the world: those
in the oil and gas industry. So strength in
numbers is crucial.

Let’s use apossible political scenario to see
why a domestic strategy isneeded: Germany
has decided to take a top—down approach to
environmental policy change, rather than a
grass-roots, bottom-up approach. The Ger-
man government has subsidized and incen-
tivized the use of solar panels by taxing those
who use other non—renewable utilities more
than those who go solar. The government
then uses the proceeds to ﬁnance the solar
industry. Of course, this already gives voters
the wrong idea on environmental policy as

consequently, this political strategy does not
encourage collective action amongthe masses
—— rather, it alienates them. _
Pennsylvania Gov. Torn Corbett recently
proposed to open up state parks and forests
to hydraulic fracking. As a result, he can ex-
pect some hefty campaign donations from
the oil and gas industries  will certainly
help him get re-elected. But what if there was
a way to inform every Pennsylvanian about
the proposal? If people were aware of the im-

I abig-government-sponsored business. And \

comes to the climate. It’s time   , 

plications for the environment, the political
consequences would be sure and swift. Either
Corbett would change his policy to appeal to
his constituents or they would boot him out.

To generate a paradigm shift, the policy .

must resonate with the voters.
This is exactly how the tea party replaced
incumbent candidates — who had consistent

‘and wealthy campaign contributors — with

fresh—faced.politicians who were relatively
new to the game but at the same ﬁme were
representatives to whom these voters could
relate. The teaparty informed the electorate
of their agenda and got them to their side by
appealing to their interests and anxieties.
Therefore, climate change can no longer
be viewed as an issuellarger than the vot-

. ers, themselves. It must constantlybe on our

minds and we need to hold our politicians
accountable, but that  only be done with
action. p i ' V" .2  i"j:.<~:.. L

Though it might seem likean unlikely out-
come, Pitt’s baseball team has a chance to
sit atop the Coastal Division standings in
the ACC at the end of this weekend.

The Panthers’ conference record cur-
rently sits at 7-5, which as of now is good
for fourth in the Coastal. A sweep of the

Virginia Cavaliers — currently ranked as l
the No. 1 team in the nation according to’

the National Collegiate Baseball Writers
of America — and at least one loss by the
Miami Hurricanes would thrust Pitt all the
way to the top of the division standings.

It’s a fortuitous position to be in, con-
sidering the Panthers’ mixed i_n-confer-
ence play.

After a 1-5 start in conference play in
its inaugural season in the Atlantic Coast
Conference, Pitt (15-13, 7-5 ACC) appeared

to haverightedits ship, winning the next
six conference games by sweeping Duke
and Georgia Tech.

But after two consecutive losses this

‘ past Tuesday and Wednesday to the

West Virginia Mountaineers and the
Youngstown State Penguins, this week-
end’s ACC series against the heralded
Cavaliers marks Pitt’s biggest challenge
thisseason.

The Cavaliers, who are N o. 3 in Baseball
America’s latest top-25 poll, boast a 25-4
record — including a 10-2 mark in confer-

ence play —- and are riding an eight-game .

winning streak.

The series opener will take place Friday
afternoon, with the ﬁrst pitch slated for
3 p.m. at CharlesL. Cost Field. Game two
on Saturday will also commence at 3 p.m.,
while the series ﬁnale will begin at 1 p.m.
on Sunday.

Despite knowing that this series is an-

 

other signiﬁcant one as Pitt continues to
plow through its ACC conference schedule,
the Panthers maintain that the ranking in T
front of their opponent’s name has little
meaning. 1

“This weekend is a pretty important
weekend for us, just like any other,” red-
shirt junior starting pitcherjoseph Harvey
said. “We are:.gl5ingj*intos;the weekend ex-
pecting to win‘«tli‘e‘ séiiés and also sweep it,

another winning streak as it enters the ﬁnal
month of its schedule. _

Maybe that chance to get back to winning
was whyjunior ﬁrstbaseman Carly Thea was
anxious to return to the ﬁeld after the ﬁrst
game. V 2

,“I like playing doubleheaders, I just wish
the break between was a little shorter,” Thea
said after the win on Tuesday. “I don’t neces-
sarily think ithas to be 30 minutes [between
games]. Ithinkalo-minute break is just ﬁne.
Let’s just keep going. We’re alreadyin it, let’s
go.”

Thea and the rest of the Panthers (12-15,
3-5 ACC) have to wait a bit longer before their
next games.

Pitt travels this weekend to Chestnut Hill,
Mass., to play althree-game series against
ACC-opponent Boston College, beginning
with a doubleheader Saturday. The ﬁrst game
is set for a 1 p.m. start, followed by a 3 p.m.
start for game two. First pitch for Sunday’s
affair is slated for noon; L ' * - ‘ " 

In their ﬁrst season, the Panthers are set to
make the Atlantic Coast Conference tourna-
ment. First, though, they will have to hold off
the ninth-place Eagles (15-15, 2-7 ACC), ranked

just one spot behind Pitt in the ACC standings.

said: “When we put it all together, we can
play with anyone.”

Pitt head coach Joejordano said a key
aspect of the series will be how well the
team is able to overcome their past two
losses, particularly the disappointing 7-6
defeat at Youngstown State.

“To say the least, [the Youngstown State
loss] was a disappointing ball game,” Jor-
dano said. “We certainly are going to need

the Cavaliers haven’t oﬂicially%ommitted

to a starter, either, a potential matchup‘
looms against Virginia’s ace left-handed A

pitcher Nathan Kirby (5-1, 1.24 ERA), who

sports the best ERA of any starting pitcher _

in the ACC.

Regardless of who is oﬁtlien mound, T‘)

the Panthers will still have their hands full
against a potent Virginia linepp.

outﬁelder Mike Papi (.354 avg, 5 home
runs, 26 RBIs) and junior inﬁelder Branden
Cogswell (.324 avg, team-leading 36 hits)
usually bat third and ﬁrst, respectively,
and have led the way, but there aren’t many
weak spots in the lineup.

Junior outﬁelder DerekiFisher might
have been the most feared part of the
lineup, but he suffered a broken hamate
bone in his right wrist on March 12 and
has been out of action since.

Fisher (ranked 10th), Papi (39th), ju-
nior third baseman/pitcher Nick Howard
(43rd), Cogswell (47th) and junior outﬁeld-
er Brandon Downes (53rd) were all ranked
among the top 100 college prospects by
Baseball America in January.

But Downes has struggled to the tune
of a .230 average and Howard has been a
much better pitcher than hitter, posting
a 1.88 earned run average in 13 relief ap-
pearances against just a .674 on—base plus
slugging percentage at the ‘plate. A

While the other Cavaliers who haven’t
been slumping are certainly going to test
Pitt, the team attitude has been nothing
short of conﬁdent.

Clearly, the Cavaliers present a formi-
dable challenge for the Panthers. Don’t tell

‘ Johnson that, though.

tournament since it moved from the Big
East to the ACC in 2006, but with the cur-
rent rankings, the Eagles are poised to miss
out, since only the top eight teams make the
tournament.

This weekend’s road games will be a test

for the Panthers, as it is only their second

conference series on the road. Road wins

have been difficult to come by, as the team is V

2-7 away from Vartabedian Field. Pitt’s only
other ACC road series was against Virginia,
and they were swept in three games. Boston

College, on the other hand, is returning home - a_
‘ 'miredinaﬁve-game losing streak. "A V  

Junior pitcher Savannah King will most

likely pitch at least one of the games this ’

weekend. King leads the team in appearances
with 23 and has started 18 of the Panthers’
games. On Tuesday, King (7-11, 3.92 ERA)
rebounded from game one to game two.

King started game one against Robert
Morris but, after giving up four straight hits
and allowing two runs to score without re-
cording an out, was pulled in favor of junior
pitcher Alexa Larkin. Game two was a dif-
ferent story. King recovered and pitched a
complete game — her tenth of the season.
On top of striking out one batter, King sur-
rendered one run on three hits in the mercy-
rule—shortened ﬁve-inning game.

“It was my mentality, I knew I needed
to do something different,” she said Tues-
day. “I needed to show them I was going to
dominate.”

. Kingwasn’t the only part of the team that
caught ﬁre in the second game.

Since having the opportunity to play

games with the weather cooperating, the ,

Panthers’ bats have been hot. Pitt has hit
at least one home run in its last six games,
including seven in its last ACC series against
Virginia.

Thea and redshirt sophomore inﬁelder
Maggie Sevilla have been on ﬁre in that
stretch.

Thea, currently hitting .361, leads the
team in batting average, boosted by a 3-for-
5 Tuesday against the Colonials. She added
three RBIs and three runs in the double-
header.

Sevilla, the reigning ACC Player of the
Week, helped lead Pitt to a 3-1 record on the
week by hitting .571 at the plate with three
home-runs, nine RBIs and six runs. She’s

April 4, 2014 ] The Pitt News | W/vvv.piiinevvs.c0m

clubbed home runs in three consecutive
games.

With this hot hitting, Sevilla has brought
her batting average up to .308 and boasts
a team—high seven home runs this season.
Sevilla also leads the team in RBIs and runs
scored. Her hot streak looks to continue
against the Eagles, as she is batting .542
against ACC teams.

Boston College has their own hot hitters,
as well. The top two players with the highest
batting averages can be found in the outﬁeld.
At the plate, senior Tory Speer has hit .333

with a team—leading six home runs. Sopho-
more Megan Cooley leads the Eagles with
a batting average of .418, which  her
second overall in the ACC. Her 38 hits rank
her ﬁfth in ACC standings, as well.

Another batter that the Panthers will
need to watch out for isfreshman catcher/
third baseman Tatiana Cortez, who is second
in ACC standings with nine.home runs and
fourth with 30 RBIs.

Pitcher Nicole D’Argento has pitched
the ﬁfth—most innings in the conference.
Through 114.2 innings, Ditxrgento is 9-9 with

 

9

a 2.89 ERA and nine complete games. The
graduate student has struck out 110 batters
but has allowed 156 to reach base.

Just a few days removed from being stifled

by another tough pitcher in Nicole Sleith A

of Robert Morris, Pitt proved it can bounce
back. That persistence, Thea said, is what
stood out most alter the series split against
Robert Morris.

“Just the fact that we were able to make
that change shows exactly who were are as a
team,” Thea said. “Even if we lose a game here
and there, we’ll come back and we’ll ﬁght.”
