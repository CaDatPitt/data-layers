“Oh, that. “Well. you see, I

an essay or something”;  

“It?s an‘[ess_a'y,' all right. But do
you ' know what it-’s about? Do
you? She didn’t wait for an an-
swer. “It's writtenby a lucidus
of the Polyergus outfit._ His name’s
Schopenhauer."

‘ Youngster Trouble’

“Oh, oh,” Daphne gulped. “Why
if I knew he wrote that, I’d have
ripped it up on the spot. He’s the
drone who got up that tract ‘On
Education.’ I’ve had trouble with
the youngsters ever since.”

“Well, you haven’t seen any-
thing. That fellow ought to be fed
to the spiders. Wait a minute.
Ho, there, Florence, G-ertrude, Ce-
cile,” she shouted. Soon the lead-
ers of the militia approached,‘ bow-
ing and scraping.

“Girls,” the Queen ordered, “you
go over to the Polyergi and get
that drone by the name of Schop-
enhauer. Bring him back at once.”

The three bowed, bustled away.

“Now we’ll see,” the Queen re-
marked.

“But what did he..say?” Daphne
began. “He must have sizzled this
time to stir you up so.”

“He’ll sizzle more when I get
through with him. Look here,”
she said, waving the parchment.
“Just listen to this:

“ ‘Women are ﬁtted for acting as
the nurses and teachers of our
early childhood by the fact that
they are themselves childish, friv-
olous, and short-sighted . . .

“ ‘The only business that claims
their earnest attention is love,
making conquests, and everything
connected with this--dress-., danc-

‘The Fair Sex’

“ ‘It is only the man whose in-
tellect is clouded that could give
the name of the fair sex to that
under-sired, narrow - shouldered,
broad-hipped, and short-legged

“Now.” the Queen said breath-

that?” O

Daphne  “Well, you,

The drone whimpered, gulped,

Wide attention has been-attract-

ed in recent months by the activi-
ties of the Catholic Radical Alli-
ance in championing the cause of
labor organizations and picketing

recent action of this kind was the

gress for Peace and Democracy,”
which the Alliance branded as a
Communist group.

cuss phases of the Catholic Radic-
al Alliance program, including its
immediate practical and charita-
ble activities and its basic plan of
“distributism.”

Following the usual Inquiry
Forum procedure, Father Rice
will address the audience for the
first half of the hour, and will an-
swer questions from the floor for
the remainder of the period. The
meeting is open to all students and
faculty members.

Women Edit The News;

By LEO KOEBERLEIN

Women to the right of me,
women to the left of me, and
women occupying all the places
ordinarily held
down by men in
this office. So,
placing a bit of
discretion before
valor, your cor-
respondent will

this story and
leave the gals to

Miss Conn
vices and The Pitt News.

This situation (the numerous
women) started a long time back,
1895 to be exact, when the ﬁrst
woman was admitted to the Uni-
versity as a student.

After that first bustle of fem-
inity on campus, women have
gradually increased their circle of
influence in University education-
al and social life, and have added

both humorous and‘ continuous.
That, however, is another story

completely. This story concerns
todav’s Pitt News and its-women’s
staff who have taken over the pa-
per for the day‘. ' . _
Over at the battered imitation-«
walnut desk in the'corn'er, usually

which someone else; has done .

considered private property by this
reporter, is Marion Conn, C39,
editor-in--chief for the day. A pic-
ture of Marion has been bouncing
around in the filing cabinet for
some time now; here’s hoping the
managing editor will use it.

Tall, brunette, and popular
Marion is directing the work of
the entire staff——except for a large
number of men who have decided
to make it women’s issue com-
pletely by walking out. It will
be to Marion, and this a fervent
wish, that the usual and ordinary
complaints from any or all dis-
gruntled readers will go.

Marion’s right hand Woman
for the day is Dorothy Davis,
C39, in the position of manag-
ing editor. Dottie is responsible
for the “nice looks” of the front
page and much of the selection of
news stories. Dottie usually
graces the office as society edi-
tor who sees that your name or
organization receives mention in
Socialitems columns.

Campus editor for the issue is
Ann Whippo, C39. Everyone
knows Ann.’ She’s that junior
«girl who never seems to :be ._at. a
 for’ smiles. Ordinarily she’s

d.e1it-Faculty Association For-
mu platform this afternoon at
1 o'clock in 24 Cathedral.

Director of the Unive1'sit.y
News Service and adviser to
student publications, Mr. ‘ira-
ham has  his siibject, “’I‘he
“The Panay and the Press.”

In his discussion, Mr. Graham
will analyze the action of Ameri-
can newspapers after the bomb-
ing of the gunboat in the Yangtze
river last month. The Forum
speaker surveyed thirty-ﬁve news-

, papers to ﬁnd his observations.

Three sides of newspapers will
beconsidered in “The Panay and
the Press” discussion. Editorials,
news treatment, and pictures

er. Mr. Graham has commented
}that after the Panay sank he was
,'impressed by the pacific attitude
taken by newspapers throughout
the country.

However, the Forum audience
of students and faculty members
will hear the speaker illustrate
the different attitudes towards
the affair taken by papers in va-
rious parts of the country.

Covering the Panay situation,
Mr. Graham will also speak more
generally of “the press and neu-
trality.” That was to have been
his subject at the December For-
um. However, at the time, Milton
Lehman, C39, chairman of the
Forum series, announced the post-
ponement of the Forum until to-
day.

At the conclusion of his half-
hour address, Mr. Graham will
turn to questions from the audi-
ence. The lecture today closes
the current series for the semes-
ter.

will be covered by the speak-'.

Women’s Day

Recalls Acceptance Oi Coeds

With the commemoration of the
entrance of women into the Uni-
versity, it is only natural that
there should be some retrospec-
tion into the times when co—educa-
tion was a comparatively new
thing in our city. How and when
did women obtain the right to en-
roll in the University?
that preference was the most rec-

Coeducation at the University
of Pittsburgh has a rather in-
volved history dating back to the
eighteenth century.

Although, “was not the fashion
of that day” the charter of the
Pittsburgh Academy in 1787 in-
for girls. Julia
Wrenshall, the mother-in-law of
Ulysses Grant, was" probably the
most outstanding student who

jstudifed under this provision.

 IN 1395
However,- the formal beginning
.'of" formal education in’ all the
schools of‘ the’ University was
 until 1895,‘ although
women who “showed interest and
capability" were admitted to spe-
cial courses before this time.

The change was undoubtedly,

  Journalism

A ..
aided by the opinion of the boys.
“that it would be a good thing if
the Chancellor would import a
few more girls,” published in the
student publication Co-urant, but
the immediate reason was the re-
quest of Margaret and Stella Stein
to enter the College. This encour-
aged other women to enter both
the College and the professional
schools.

FIRST COEDS NAMED

Elva Thornberiy was the ﬁrst
to graduate from the School of
Medicine, and Judge Sara Soffel
was the ﬁrst in the law school.

With the addition of coeduca-
tion, there necessarily followed
social and extra-curricular activi-
ties for women. The first step
was‘ the organization of the W0-
men’s Activities’ Association in
1912 which developed into the
Women’s Self Government Asso-
ciation in 1920, under the inﬂu-
ence of Miss Thyrsa W. Amos,
who assumed the office of the Dean
of Women, when it was first es-
tablished by the University in
1919.

Classes

Pick Best News Of ’37

It’s contagious, this epidemic oi%

choose the ten best such-and-
such of the year. The craze hits
the country at each year’s end,
‘enjoys widespread publicity for a
few weeks after New Year’s, and
then dies a natural death.

This year, the parlor game fad
includes “Choose the ten out-
standing news events of 1937.”

Not to be outdone by the bal-
loting of the American Institute
of Public Opinion, Life magazine,
the New York Times, the Pitts-
burgh Press, and other news in-
dicators of the pulse beat of the
nation, 40 students enrolled in the
journalism classes under Robert
X. Graham, director of publicity
and news service at the Univer-
sity, balloted a few days ago on
this subject.

Completely taken by surprise,
the students showed varied pref-
erences, and results were very
much non—conclusive.

PANAY INCIDENT

The recent story of the sinking
of the U. S. gunboat Panay was
chosen as the outstanding news
eventof 1937 by the largest ma-
jority of the 40 balloting. It was
generally agreed by the victims
interviewed after the balloting,
on the; fact that this incident was

_that preference was based more

the mostrecent event on the list,
than for any other reason.

Men balloting judged that the
stock“-market slump deserved sec-
ond place in the panorama of

events in 1937; women students
placed second the ﬂoods in the
Ohio and Mississsippi valleys.
This, too, is non-conclusive, un-
less one would stretch the point
that the fellows are worried about
business, while women take the
more humanitarian View-point.
OTHER NEWS EVENTS

Seven other outstanding news
events selected by the students
included: strikes in the automo-
tive and steel industries, the Hin-
denburg dirigible disaster, Roose-
velt’s attack on the
Court, the appointment of Just.-
ice Black, the New London (Texa-
as) school explosion, the corona-
tion of King George VI, and the
marriage of the Duke of Windson
and Mrs. Simpson.

Well, that’s that, and now the
country will put away their favor-
ite New Year’s parlor game and
enter into the serious business of
making more news, so they can
have more fun again next year.

 

Engineers Change

Date Of Smoker

The Engineering Association’s
ﬁrst smoker of the year‘ will be

A Bit Of Consideration:
For Women’s Health Service

to bring to the atxlention of eve1ryoi.1o all time past accom-
plishments, and future aims. of \\'()l.llt‘ll at the University.

But this day should car1i'y with it mention of what women

at tlie University iieetl. (hie particular need has been heard
fr-om v..'on1e11 stiililents in tin: last few weeks, and they want
something‘ done about it.

The Student’ Health Service» for ‘Women has 21. large room,
now used as space for a small number of cots, available dur-
ing the day for women students. These cots are uscable only
until 5 p. 111., when the Health’ Service offices close.

\-Vhat about after tliosc lrouvrs-‘E’ ‘Wl1at about girls who
commute cach day. and must remain for late ineetings some
evenings? Certainly it would be a splendid convenience for
them to be able to go into tile cot room and rest for the hour
or so they have to Wait before their niectixigs.

The matiter has been presented to Dr. Auleene hlarley Jam-
ison, cliector of the Student Health Service for Women. She
says: “Making the facilities of the health service available to
women. commuters in the evenings. would be a fine-tliing. More-
over, it wouldbe a simple matter- Two things are needed._First,
there would have to be a inatron einployed to t.ake.charge of
the room for those few hours, and second, to accommodate a
larger number. of girls, more cots would have to be purchased.”

Editor, The Pitt News:

I have for some time thought
veiy highly of the. journalistic
standard of your paper and any
‘critical comment will not, I trust, E
be regarded in any sense as a{
general indictment. I/Vhat I have
to say concerns the use of quota-
tion marks. ,

It is no easy matter to copy a
Quotation correctly out of a book.
It is exceedingly diﬁicult to re-
duce a verbal statement to an ac-
curate quotation unless shorthand
is used. And it is practically im-
possible to talk at random with
another, making no notes, and
later write up the conversation
‘with entire accuracy. The other
;day I had such a conversation
fwith one of your reporters and
another student. In the next is-
sue of The News I found myself
quoted.

' But the reporter had “stepped-
gup” my language considerably in
1 two or three places. The conver-
lsation dealt with the sinking of,

 

{the Fancy and the prospect thatf}
ithe Japanese Emperor would be
lcxpected to apologize in person.
{The reporter got. the general drift
lot’ .my_ thought which was that it
'would be exceedingly unwise to

lit’ the. Japanese were willing to
I make : adequate reparations in
other :ways. A war over this is-
 sue jwould almost certainly be re-
‘-garded_, in later years as a dis-

 

the “militaristic” at-
the President. That
{was the reporter’s contribution,
‘but it ;was put inside my quota-
tion ~ marks.
In -behalf of the reporter I
'might-.say that much more expe-
rienced persons than he or my-
self have with perfectly good in-
tentions made errors in quota-
tions. I recall a reviewer who, in
copying eight lines irom a book,
made ﬁve separate mistakes. I
suggest, in 3 very friendly spirit,
that any quotations on “hot” sub-
jects should be referred back to
the person, quoted for veriﬁcation!

E This article, which appeared in

The person directly responsible
for the Pitt Band’s rendition of

bandsmen, as is customary. on
every Wednesday afternoon dur-
ing football season, were discuss-
ing possibilities of some novel for-
mation to spring at the Nebraska
game, when he hit upon the idea.
of having the Band do a “Big Ap-

and the formation was decided on.

It seems that one summer John

1 Outmoded Slogan‘

‘Win ’Em All,’
Remains In Use
By KAL IKALVVARY

Johnny Schroeder, Don Mae-
;\;'aught'on, Bob Stewart, Billy
Thompson, and Captain Vie
Baylock are the five beefy Syr-
-acuse beans-tocks whom Joe
‘Garcia, Myles Zeleznik, Rags
Radvansky, Eddie Spotovieh,
and Captain Bob Johnson, of
the Panther brigade, must stop
Saturday night, in New York, if
 are to have .500 percentage
‘before church bells sound Sun-
day. And any one of the Orange
shazopshooters are capable of stag-
ing a Luisetti specialty-——almost.

Perhaps this strong opposition
‘v-will whet the win appetite of the
Pittmen tomorrow evening. At
least that is the hope of Coach
Carlson, who plans to keep his
starting lineup mentioned
above intact. The local
quintet has run hot and cold, and
exhibited little of their well-
known caginess, so far this season.
Nevertheless, Dr. Carlson will con-
tinue to entrust his somewhat de-
flated seasonal ultimatum, “Win
’-em all,” with these seniors.

Syracuse’s defense is effective
in either the man-to-man or zone
style. Coach Andrea’s boys also
know how to shatter both of these
defensive systems. Syracuse"-s
ﬂoor stars have proven their
strength against five of the na-
tion’s leading teams, taking the
measure of  Lawrence, Niagara,
Princeton, Toronto, and Creighton
without exerting too much effort.

Pi-tt’s court representatives this
season are not as strong as in pre-
vious campaigns-; still they have
failed to even display their poten-
tian strength. The Blue and Gold
athletes show a ﬁve-game record
of two wins and three losses. And
the two victories were not deci-
sive. Fordham and Northwestern
were the Pitt victims, while Ken-
tucky, Butler, and Wisconsin
humbled the Cathedral courtmen.

Dr. Carlson will escort a squad
3:‘ twelve players to New York—-
Captain Johnson, I, Garcia, Zelez-
nik, Radvansky, Spotovich, John-
son, II, Scott, Lawry, Sherer.
McCance, Wolbers, and Edwards.
Mendlow, a promising sophomore,
suffered a broken nose in Tues-
—:iay"s scrimmage, and will not
make the trip.

Following the Fordhain tilt, the
Oaklanders will return here to be
ready for the City Conference in-
augural, with Duquesne, on the
Stadium ﬂoor.

llntramural
Tournaments

Scheduled

Campus sports lovers will get
their share of athletics during the
coming year if Harvey Rocker,
director of intramural athletics,
has anything to say about it. And,

of course, Mr. Rooker, being in ,

complete charge of intramural
sports, does have something to say
 the matter. ‘

Accordingly, he has made up an
overlapping schedule of athletics,
including everything from ping-
pong to basketball, which will de-
light the heart of even the most
athletic-minded Pitt students.

The schedule, starting next
Wednesday with a volleyball
tourament, and ending only with
the close of school for the annual

summer vacation, lists bowling,
basketball, swimming, track.
mushball and ping-pong. All

dates are overlapping, so that not
an idle moment slips in.

Any student‘-,, or team composed
of students, is eligible, but must
first ﬁll in an application blank
available at the office of Mr.
Booker at Trees Gym. Practice
hours for teams will be scarce, due
to the crowded" condition of the
Physical Education schedule, but
limitedperiods of time may possi-
my be vailable if Mr. Rooker is
contacted in. advance.

The intramuraliathletic schedule
follows:

January. 5-21: — Volleyball
Tournament.

January 17-28 — Ping-pong
Tornament.

February 7-? -— Basketball

lnterfraternity volley ball play
began Wednesday evening at
Trees Gym as Phi Delta Theta
and Kappa Sigma advanced into
the second round by outclassing
their first opponents.

The Phi Delts, in two exciting
matches, took the measure of Pi
Lambda Phi. The Phi Delts won
the first game, 15-11, lost the sec-
ond by the same score, and
smashed their way out front in
the ﬁnal and ' deciding contest,
‘15-3.

Kappa Sigma, aiming to get
back the title after a year's va-
cancy, trounced Theta Chi in a
contest that likewise required
three games. Winning the ﬁrst,
15-8. the Kappa Sigs were beaten
in the second, 15-8. They cap-
tured the decider, 15-9.

Predominant in the play of both
games were Dr. Jock Sutherland’s
powerful footballers. Bob Dan-
nies and Johnny Dickinson led the
Phi Delts to victory while Len
Schwartz was the standout in the
Pi Lamb lineup.

MEET JOHN CARROL

Coach.John Mcsorley in a meet-
ing held Wednesday outlined a
program designed to bring the
team up to a near peak before the
next league game scheduled for
Wednesday, January 12, with John
Carrol.

Under his careful eye the boys
will work out on the Garden Ice
three times a week. The other
two days will be spent on the Sta-
dium cinders. Running and prac-
tice shooting will be the menu in
bowl with a generous sprinkling
of calisthenics as a side dish.

Following this rigorous set-to

L the boys will gather and have a

blackboard and discussion session.

SEE ALL PRO GAMES

Besides all this regular work
which every hockey squad goes
through our Pitt boys will see all
the International American Hock-
ey games at the Garden.

Mcsorley intends to take ad-
vantage of the hockey clinics the
Pittsburgh Hornets are sponsor-
ing before each game and has in-
structed the boys to go early and
observe with the idea of putting
into practice what they see.

The boys took the ice last night
for the ﬁrst time since recess un-
der their coach’s hand. Mcsorley
put them through a stiff session
and held a short scrimmage.

Panthers Accept Bid

To Millrose

Games

Woodruff, Rydenf
Mile Relay Team,

Receive Invites

Coach Carl Olson spends a
good deal of time reading let-
ters that invite him to pack up
Johnny W'oodruff, the mile re-
lay team, and various parts of
the Pitt track team and bring
them along to compete in vari-
ous indoor meets.

TO NEW YORK

The Olsonmen have accepted
one of the invitations and will
keep a date on February 5 at
Madison Square Garden, New
York, for the Millrose games.

Each year the Millrose Com-
mittee invites the outstanding
track stylists in the country. The
meet is an eye-opener, and track
experts and critics receive the
first evidence of what the new
track season will offer. Track
records usually take a beating
from the crack trackmen that the
Millrose games draw.

, VVOODRUFF ENTERED

Olson will take a squad of six
to New York. Johnny Woodruff,
World record holder and Olympic
champion, will get his first oppor-
tunity, this season, to lower the
half-mile record. Johnny will
probably get that record this year
and Madison Square Garden is
just as choice a place as any.

The presence of Kenneth Ry-

Prep star, is back with the squad.
His absence, along with several
others, due to ineligibility, was
keenly felt during the ﬁrst game
in which Duquesne won 3-1. With

with the ex-ineligibles, Mcsorley
sending a much
stronger sextet. of puckmen on the

Dukes.

“1’VE bought 4,000,000 pounds of tobacco at auc-
tions in the past ten years,” says Mr. Valentine,
independent buyer of Westﬁeld, N. C., “and my
bread and butter depends on making the right
bids. That’s why I have to know tobacco values.

"Now I’ve smoked Luckies ever since 1918, and the
reason is, they suit my taste to a ‘T’. Nobody" knows
better than we tobacco men that Luckies are made
of the finest center-leaf tobacco.”

Yes--and that isn’t all. . . Luckies’ exclusive process,
“It’s Toasted” takes out certain irritants naturally
present in all tobacco-—even the finest! The result
is that you will find Luckies not only taste good
but are easy on your throat.

Surely,indep-enden-t experts like.Mr.Val'en.t:ine make
good judges of cigarettes . . . Sworn records show
that, among independent tobacco experts, Luckies
have twice as many exclusive smokers as have all
other cigarettes combined!

wnu MEN wuo KNOW TOBACCO BEST |

den, high hurdler, is also requested
by the Millrose Committee. Ry-
den will skim hurdles with the
best in intercollegiate circles, and
that means just about the best in
the world. Four members of the
mile relay team will complete the
squad.

Seven boys are battling for
places on that mile relay team
with Johnny Woodruff the only
sure starter. Art Thomas, lead-
off man on last year’s relay team,
faces a real ﬁght for a spot on
the baton carrying quartet.

Four members of last year’s
freshman team, which won the
Penn freshman relay, are pressing
for places on the varsity relay.
Frank Ohl, Allen McKee, Al Fer-
rara, and Robert Cogswell are
sophomores making the bid. Ed
Zolnowski and Ben Kopec, jun-
iors, are two others still literally
in the running for places on the
relay.

OLSON COY

Olson was very my about dis-
cussing his boys’ chances in the
games. He talked about Cunning-
ham’s great showing against San
Romani at New Orleans, where
Olson took in the Coaches con-
vention.

He freely discussed the beauty
of New Orleans on New Year's
day. Maybe he can hold forth on
Paris in the spring. But about

Woodruif and Ryden and the mile 2
relay team’s prospects in the lVlil1- ;

rose game Olson thought that,
“Maybe they might make a fair
showing.” Which is being very
speciﬁc.

Struggle
In Finals

Coach Mazeski’s mat agitators,
also known as the wrestling team.
ﬁnally turned on the heat and
sweated out the ﬁnals recently in

the intra-mural wrestling tourna-
ment.

In the ﬁrst bout of the after-
noon, Bill Hoveler, 125, won over
DeBlasio after 5 minutes and 37
seconds of struggling.

PADEN WINS

Park and Paden put on a one-
sided affair with Paden, 135, com-
ing out on top. Paden won by a
fall after 2 minutes and 26 sec-
onds. _

Ardolino, representing the 145-
pound class, was awarded the
championship in his class as his
opponent failed to appear.

Bob Gregory, a former Dormont

.High matman, put his experience
gto full use and won a quick vic-
l tory over a less seasoned opponent
Iin 1 minute and 31 seconds». The
weight, 155.

In a two-minutes and 30 second
fall, King tripped Flom and won
the laurels for the 165-pounders.

LARUE, JR., BEATEN

Bobby LaRue, a gridman of the
past, should give his younger
brother, a Pitt Freshman, a few
pointers on the rough and tumble
game. The Junior LaRue could
have used some pointers when
Dimit, 175, sort of took the boy
to the cleaners and won by time
advantage.

Frank Kristufek, former senior
AMA champ, didn’t get a chance
,to display his grunting tactics as
he won by default.

Coach Mazeski commented after
the bouts and said, “This is the
best turnout I’ve ever had. If

‘all the best men of my previous
teams were matched against this
i year’s team, I think that the pres-
,‘ ent squad would win.”

Threefold Causes
Of ‘War Boom’
Voluntary boycott of Japanese

goods by Americans as a means of
ﬁghting the “war boom” was pro-

gressing all over. the-—» world 

advocated‘ by E. Kingm:ln.»Eb.e1'_-
hart, instructor in economics, in
a talk Wednesday at the ‘IM-
YWCA sophomore club banquet.

Pointing out the unusually great
increases in expenditures for arm-
aments by important nations of
the world, since 1931, Mr. Eber-
hart emphasized that while Ger-
many and Russia have raised their
appropriations by over 1000 per
cent, the United States has also
been increasing armaments at an
unprecedented rate, “strictly for
defense, of course.”

WAR BOOM

“The war boom, which is now
growing, is being accelerated by
three factors-—the cupidity of bus-
iness, national stupidity, and in-
ternational anarchy,” said Mr.
Eberhart.

With prices of many goods im-
portant to nations at war steadily
increasing and American business-
es proﬁting from the raises, there
is danger that this country will
become involved in another war
for the same reason that helped
bring on our entrance into the
World War, Mr. Eberhart declar-
ed.

CAUSE or WAR

“When the Allies had no more
gold with which to buy American
goods, and the private interests
which had been extending credit
to them began to get jittery, there
Was only one way to safeguard
the investments already made—
by having the government extend
credit. And that was an act of
war,” he stated.

Labeling the Panay aﬁaiar as
a “heaven-sent incident” to put
the American public in a frame of
mind" to accept the announcement
of a larger armament. program,
Mr. Eberhart charged that most of

‘ the gojvermnents of. the world are
 such a position economically

to stave 01!: political repercus-
sions. '

EXPBESSESP DISAPPROVAL.

To combat. the “war boom,f"Hr.
 declared that the public
should“ express their disapproval
in every: possible way. i

“In a. wax: in which there is. a
clear case oﬁaggression, {believe
that action of‘ non—milltar;y char-
acter is. very: desirable. A volun-
tary. boycott of Jjapanese goods
would not lead to war, but would
serve to  Japan seri-
ously.

“I believe that it is better that
a few innoccent merchants of
Japan should be injured than for
China to be further ruined eco-
nomically and thousands of her
people killed.

“Economic boycott of Japan by
Americans would be a rebuke to
the war boom everywhere,” said
Mr. Eberhart.
