Regular Edition

Ballet Will Feature Concert
By Women’s Choral Tonight

Program, At Carnegie
Hall, To Commence
At 8 O’Clock

Featuring a colorful ballet, instead
-of the usual guest artist, the Women’s
Choral will offer its eighth annual
home concert this evening at 8 o’clock
in the Carnegie Music Hall. - The pro-
gram will be presented by the entire
Choral group. directed by Mrs. Robert
Ayars. Lucille Hamilton is the ac-
companist.

A varied program will beoffered,
ranging all the way from early Italian
to modern French songs, as well as
early English Rounds. Following
these selections, the quartet, consist-
ing of Annabelle Knupp, C37; Doro-
thy Swearer, E‘d36; Grace Siefert,
Ed36; and Carolyn Hall, Ed37, will
offer a group of compositions includ-
ing; “Marie,” by Franz, “See the
Gypsy,” a Hungarian folk song, and
Schubert’s “Hark, Hark, the '-Lark.”

The highlight of the concert will be
the ballet, “Sleeping Beauty,” written
by Tschaikowsky and based upon an
old folk tale. Miss Elizabeth Rearick,
instructor in physical education, has
selected the dancers, members of
WAA, and composed the dance num-
bers.

Legend ls Theme

The ballet opens with the christen-
ing of the baby princess, who eventu-
ally will become the ruler of the
mystical kingdom. Among those
bringing gifts, is the Flower Fay,
Marjorie Noah, C37. who gives the
princess beauty, wisdom, and a lovely
voice. The part of the Flower Fay
will be sung by Marion Werner, C37,
who was also the soloist at last year’s
concert.

Breaking in upon the happy group,

a witch,,Ruth Anderson, Ed37, curses ~

the princess with death as a result of
a pin prick. The Flower Fay changes
the curse of death to a sleep of a hun-
dred years, after which the princess
will be awakened by a charming
prince.

Years pass, and one day the
princess, June Green, C38, pricks her
ﬁnger on a spindle. Immediately she
and her whole court fall asleep. An-
other hundred years pass and at last
Puss—in-Boots, Eleanor Sandburg, C38,
and the white lady cat, Mary Jo
Kunkle, Ed37, see the prince Peggy
Donley, C39, approaching.

Prince Charming awakens the sleep-
ing princess and her court attendants
and, as in all fairy tales, they live
happily ever after.

Costumes for the production were
designed by Miss Eleanor Boland, as-
sistant in physical education, and
ﬁnished by the members of the cast.
Sleeping Beauty will wear a ﬂowing
white chiffon dress made on princess
lines and a pearl Juliette cap. White
satin breeches, a purple velvet cape,
and a large beret decorated with a
yellow plume, will be the costume of
the prince.

Ballet gowns of orchid, green, yel-
low, and red chiffon will be worn by
the court attendants: Dorothy Decker,
C39; Florence Miller, C39;‘ Betty
Adams, C39; Ruth Donley, C38; Sally
Brunson. C38; Helen Elinoff, C39;

News Gets Tip

On Australian
Life In Paper

Featuring a front-page picture of
the Deputy Chancellor in a pompous
white wig, news about the welcome
for so-called “freshers," and stories of
cricket games telling of players who
bat for 80 minutes, a copy. of “Honi
Soit,” official journal of the Univer-
sity of Sydney, Australia, has made

V its way to The News office.

The six-page paper, published each
Wednesday during the term, violates

‘many rules of American journalism-

chieﬂy with large advertisements on
the ﬁrst p-age—but is nevertheless _in-
tensely interesting and well written.

Of particular note" is the space de-
voted to “Faculty Elections,” these
being held each year to name officers
of the various departments of the
University. ' '

Monopolizing the sports section is
an illustrated article announcing that
Jack Metcalfe, brilliant trick per-
former, has been chosen a representa-
tive to the Olympic Games. Far
down in" the write-up is a note about
Metcalfe doing 51 feet, nine "73 inches
in the hop, step and jump event.

When told about this achievement,
Walter Good, Panther star whose
mark of a shade better than 44 feet
was good enough to win the event in
the recent Penn Relays, had only one
comment to make: “That guy must
be taking lessons fro-m some of those
kangaro-os down there.”

Most astounding in the chronicles of
the gossip column is the open refer-
ence to a party of elderly women as
“old girls,” without the quotes. Also,
there is an op’.nion probably not
meant for American consumption,
which quotes a Sydney student who
has just returned from the United
States_as considering the Australian
women smarter than those in the
USA.

Professor Addresses
Engineering Seminar

In one of the ﬁve engineering sem-
inars, Orville D, Hunt, associate pro-
fessor of electrical engineering, who is
now concluding a year as an exchange
professor from Kansas State College,
will make a comparison of the two
schools of engineering. This seminar,
the electrical engineering, will be held
at the usual time, 11:30 o’clock to-
morrow in Room 105, Thaw Hall,

Dr. John W. Oliver, head of the de-
partment of history, will address the
industrial engineering seminar which
convenes at the same time in Room
242, Cathedral.-

The combined AE-ME seminar,

meeting in Room 208, Cathedral, will
have as ‘speaker, R. L. Templin of the
Aluminum Comapny of America.
’ As the 14th of a series of discourses
by specialists of Mellon Institute, Dr.
E. H. Balz will discuss “Essential
Oils” in the Fellows Room of Mellon
Institute. This constitutes the Chem-
ical Engineering seminar.

UniversityStudent
To Attend Games

Education Senior Will Accompany
U. S. Olympic Squad To Berlin

The University will have at least
one official representative at the
Olympic Games in Berlin this sum-
mer. _

A student in the department of
physical education, G, Henry Harri-
son, Ed36, was chosen by a group of

foremost education authorities as one
of 27 men to accompany the United
States Olympic team to the games for
the purpose of studying European
physical education systems.

At a conference in St. Louis last
m"onth the records of 60 men from as
many colleges throughout the country
were examined and Harrison, because
of his ability, ﬁne scholarship, rating,
and his experience in recreation work,
was chosen as one of the lucky men.

The entire trip will be ﬁnanced by
the United States Olympic Committee.
It will include inspection tours
ithrough France, Germany, and Swit-
;‘zerland and studies of the methods
used at the famous schools of Heid-
elberg, Geneva, Lucerne, and Paris.
The party will leave July 15, on the
same ship as the Olympic team,
after a ﬁve-day training period in
New York. The men will return on
September 3.

Harrison entered the University in
1931 after his graduation from West-
inghouse High School. In his fresh-
man year he was a member of the
football and swimming teams. He al-
so played in the Band and was master
of ceremonies at last fall’s freshman
mixer dances.

His work at Kingsley Settlement
House, and his position as physical
director at the Calvary Church in East
Liberty were vital factors in his selec-
tion. Last summer he worked as a
recreation leader for the Bureau of
Recrea‘tion. Harrison, after gradua-
tion, plans to continue his work in the
recreation ﬁeld.

PBI To Elect Committee

After the election, the new commit-
tee will confer with the old to discuss
plans for the coming year. Only mem-
bers of PBI are entitled to vote in the
election.

Bob Madden’s Only A Subu-

With Australian Cup Team

What Next, Bob?

 

 

Bob Madden

ARSITY TENNIS PLAYER, who
pulled a. surprise by,p’laying on
even terms against Vivian McGrath.

By Harry E. Robinson

It's hard to keep the Maddens out
of the public limelight these days. If
it isn't thefather, who heads the Na-
tional Labor Relations Board, it may
be the family musical ensemble; and
then if it isn't that, it’s usually about
the Madden tennis act——the brothers
Joe and Bob-——being the mainsprings
on the varsity tennis team. However,
this story is different, although it does
concern tennis.

Last Friday and Saturday the
Australian Davis Cup tennis team
stopped in Pittsburgh for an exhibi-
tion match at the Pittsburgh Golf
Club. When the manager-player, Cliff
Sproule, took sick, Bob Madden, who
was serving as an official at the
matches, was called upon to substitute
fccr Sproule in a doubles affair.

Paired with Vivian McGrath, who
uses a two-handed backhand stroke,
Madden made quite an impression on
the visiting net team by his brilliant
play although the McGrath-Madden
combination lost.

Bob Scares The Visitors

With Sproule still not feeling too
chipper on Saturday, Bob took the
court against McGrath in at singles ex-
hibition. While a small crowd of ten-
nis enthusiasts looked aghast, the
youthful Madden, ranking No. 9
junior player-in the country, unloosed
a barrage of drives, volleys, and
serves on his famous opponent that
had the Anzac running around in cir-
cles.

Lapses in the ninth and eleventh
games cost Madden the ﬁrst set,
which went to McGrath, 8-6, but Bob
evened up things in the second by
scoring a 6-3 victory. The match
stopped there to allow Jack Crawford
and Adrian Quist to put on their show.

Needless to say, Madden was quite
happy at doing so well against one or

‘ the ranking net stars of the world,

and the Australians, who play 'the
United States outﬁt at Germantown
later this month, were loud in their
praise of the No, 1 Pitt star. In fact
they went on record as saying that
they see in Bob one of the future top-
ﬂighters in this country.

Early Tabulation
Reveals Greater
Vote In Survey

Responding better to the present
Pitt Poll,than to any other that has
so far been held, students Monday
voted overwhelmingly in favor of

teaching the facts about the three
“-isms” in schools, according to the
tabulation of the ﬁrst day's voting.

The formal question is: “Should
schools teach facts about all forms
of governments, including Commun-
ism, Fascism, and Socialism?”

Today's question is the last in a se-
ries of questions that have been
posed in The Pitt News, which has
been sponsoring the poll in conjunc-
tion with the American Institute of
Public Opinion and the Pittsburgh
Press. The results of Monday's and
today’s balloting will appear in next
Monday’s issue of The News. A bal-
lot appears at the bottom of this page,
and students are requested to ﬁll it
out and deposit in one of the ballot
boxes placed at convenient spots on
the campus.

The ballot boxes are at the follow-
ing places: Alumni Hall, Thaw Hall,
State Hall, and Cathedral (ﬁrst ﬂoor
lobby and outside The News Oiﬁce,
Room 709).

The present poll on the campus is
similar to many others which are also
being conducted at various universi-
ties throughout the country. Recent
questions propounded by the poll were
concerned with presidential candi-
dates and party preferences for voting
in November.

Every year college deans pop» the routine question to

The new men’s dormitory at the University of Texas

on the campus of the University of Minnesota all prece-
dent will be broken by not having a formal ceremony.
The stone is hollowed out but will contain no pictures.
It ‘has 1936 carved on itand is "marked H53. ‘When the
buildings -and grounds committee contacted the dean
about a ceremony, he sent them to the comptroller, who
sent them back to the dean, so stone H53 will just be
.placed like the rest of the stones.

a crude drawing resembling an elephant. The symbol
was tallied as one vote for the ‘Republicans.

Fortlie ﬁrst time in its history, the
University will have .a theater for its
own, when the Stephen -Foster Me-
morial is opened -early next fall.-Pre-
-viously, dramatic groups have been
forced to rent; outside "halls for their
presentations.

The Memorial is” expected to be a
boon to Pitt .P1-ayers. Modern stage
equipment will make possible exten-
sive productions. Although the seat-
ing capacity of the auditorium is not
large, the .plays will be presented for
a much longer run than formerly.

Cap and Gown is expected to take
advantage of the facilities offered by
the new auditorium. Because of lim-
ited ﬁnances, -the all-male show wa.s
limited to a four-day run this season.
Next year, it is planned, the show
will run for a much longer time, per-
haps two weeks. The time for pro-
duction Will be placed ahead to a date
in February.

Debating teams will no longer argue
at lH.einz House, but the larger and
more adequate facilities of the Me-
mo-rial will permit larger audiences
to hear them. Other groups, espec-
ially forums, may use the auditorium
for their meetings.

Most of the exterior work has al-
ready been completed, except for the
metal roof. Lead-coated copper is

being laid above the concrete ‘base.
The top of the shrine has ralready
been covered and work is well under
way on the roof of the stage.

When completed, the hexagonal
shrine -will house exhibits of the ob-
jects connected -directly with the life
of Stephen C. Foster. Among the ex-
hibits which will be donated by indi-

viduvals, musical societies, and histor-

ical societies will be musical instru-
ments, fui'.n.ture, -and manuscripts.

Steel beams have alreadymbeen
erected to support the paving which
will stretch between the Cathedral
and the Memorial. The space beneath
the terrace will be used for garage
and storage. Two stairs will lead
from the Forbes Street level up to
the terrace level.

Inside the auditorium workmen are
busy constructing the vaulted stone
ceiling which is similar in design to
that already fashioned in the
Heinz Chapel and that proposed for
the ceiling of the Commons Room of
the Cathedral. Forms for the stained-
glass windows are being placed and
the steelbeams which will support the
balcony have been installed.

For dinner-meetings, the social
room on the ground ﬂoor is to be
equipped with a. modern kitchen. Dur-
ing performances in the auditorium,
it may be used as a lounge. Provi-

sion has :been made :flor;;dressin.g room
for performers and offices for care-
takers. 'In order .to assure adeqiiate
ventilation, :a large tan-system .«1ia:s
been planned.

'-From Forbes Street, the main en-
trance -will be through a large lobby.
From the lobby a passageway leads

‘to the shrine, ‘while the entrances to

the auditorium will ‘be large arches
at the rear of the lobby.

Business Activity
Increases In City

Steel Industry High; Gains In Coal,
Electricity, Shipments Shown

 

 

Pronounced gains in industrial ac-
tivity and substantial increases in
trade in April carried the index of
business activity in the Pittsburgh
district to the highest level since Oc-
tober, 1930, announces the Monthly
Summary of the Bureau of Business

Research.

The index averaged nearly 86 per
cent of normal in April, a level ap-
proximately 30 per cent above that in
March and almost 40 per cent higher
than that in April last year. The Bu-
reau’s adjusted index reached a high
of 124.5 in July, 1929, and a 10W 0f
40.5 in March, 1933. Thus, consider-
ably more than half the drop recorded
in the 44 months from July’. 1929. '50
March, 1933, has been recovered in
the 37 months since March, 1933.

Great gains were especially appar-
ent in the steel industry and while in
the last two weeks this industry has
lost ground slightly, the operating is
still close to the highest rate in nearly
six years. At the beginning of May,
the operating rate in the district was
about 63 per cent of capacity. This
rate means that plants were operating
at more than 87 per cent of normal for
this season of the year. _

Despite the recent sharp decline in
steel scrap prices, a relatively ‘high
rate of operations is expected during
May. Fairly large orders for miscel-
laiieous iron and steel products are
still coming in. Moreover, there was
a net gain of several blast furnaces
in o.peration in the district in April.

Industrial electric power sales ex-
ceeded those in April last year by
17.2 per cent. Production of bitumin-
ous coal in western Pennsylvania was
about 20 per cent greater in April
than in March and approximately 38
per cent above the total in April, 1935.

Originating shipments averaged
nearly 28 per cent greater in April
than in March and were almost 56 per
cent higher than in April a year ago.
Decided increases were reported for
both river and rail shipments.

The volume of trade rose almost 36
per cent from March to April. Fur-
thermore, the volume in April was
30 per cent larger than in April last
year, Retail business was especially
good. Another factor aiding in this
increase was the combined sales of
Pittsburgh department stores in the
four weeks ending, May 2, being al-
most 18 per cent above those in the
corresponding four weeks of 1935.

Panther Tracknien Hope To Break
‘Injury Jinx’ At Morgantown Meet

Olsonmen Tackle West Virginia Frosh,
Varsity Track Squads Saturday;
Pitt Defeats State, 7 O-65

You just can ’t tell where the “injury jinx’

7

which has taken a

“foot-hold” on the Panther track squad since the start of the out-

door season will strike next.

On Saturday, the Olsonmen will at-

tempt to break that jinx at Morgantown when both varsity and fresh-
man teams from West Virginia and Pitt line up the sights 011 their
“shootin’ irons” at 2 o’clock on the Mountaineer track.

First, it was Art Thomas who pulled up lame in the Penn Relays

to dim the Panther hopes in the Notre e

Dame meet two weeks away. Andy
Lasky, ace hurdler, was next to pull
a. muscle, having weakened it early
in the indoor campaign. Then, last
Saturday in the Penn State meet Wal-
ter Good, Penn Relay hop-step-jump
champ and star hurdler and broad
jumper, tore a leg muscle that will
ﬁnish his competition for the remain-
der of the season.

Add all this to the loss of Tony
Matis-i and Pete Av-izienis in the
weights, and the total shows a great
deal of grief for Coach Olson and the
Pitt boys. West Virginia on the other
hand, although defeated by Penn
State, is reputed to have a fast-devel
oping squad of runners and ﬁeld men.

West Virginia’s last victory over
the Panthers came in 1933 when a
soggy track and a determined band of
Mountaineers copped a one-point de-
cision, 68-67.
Pitt squad won 95-40 in 1934, and
921/2 to 33% in 1935.

Nose Out Penn State

It was a costly victory for the Pan-
ther trackmen Saturday in their dual
engagement with Penn State for Wal-
ter Good, after clicking off his best
high hurdle race, missed the board on
his second jump in the broad jump
event and tore a muscle in his right

leg. O1son’s squad had a close call, -

ﬁnally winning out in the last event

when Charley Groat and Red Tosts

scored six points in the half mile to
put the Panthers ahead, 70-65.

The events went pretty much ac-
cording to the pre-meet predictions.
State scored a sweep in the hammer
throw as was expected, and also cop-
ped all three places in the low hurdles
when Good’s entry was scratched.

Those 16 points on the opposite side

of the ledger were a terriﬁc handicap —

for the Panthers to overcome, but

ﬁrsts and seconds in the 220, high’

jump, javelin, and pole vault events
contributed a great deal in making
possible the second Panther dual vic-
tory of the outdoor season.

Charley Groat’s thrilling yard-ad-
vantage over Downey, crack Nittany
runner, at the ﬁnish of the half mile
run was the highlight of the compe-
tition. Groat, setting the early pace,
was passed by Downey on the ﬁnal
lap, but on the last straight-away
forged ahead to catch and pass the
State junior in the last ten yards.

Red Tost continued his winning

ways in the mile run to defeat Pete I

Olexy, of State College, in the excel-
lent time of 4:25 minutes ﬂat. T‘ost

has yet to taste defeat in his specialty A

event.

Penn State's Bauer walked oﬁ with
individual scoring honors by scoring
clean-cut victories in both hurdles and
a second in the century for a total of
13 points. Gene Taano, with a 198-
foot heave in the javelin and runner-
up places in the pole vault and shot
put placed high for Pitt, with Dick
Mason hanging up the only Pitt dou-
ble victory, scoring in the sprints.

Coach Potts’ frosh squad showed
deﬁnite weakness in the weights as
the Little Lions came out on top in
the yearling competition, 76-59. John-
ny Woodruff loped through the mile
a.nd half-mile runs in near-varsity
times to feature in the freshman com-
petition.

White shirts and bright colors dot-
ted the east a.nd west sections in the
Stadium as several thousand coatless
spectators watched the double-feature
show in the hot sun. It was the lar-
gest crowd to attend a Pitt track meet
in history, according to Stadium oﬂ‘i-
cials.

Fresh Tennis Outﬁt
Loses To Dukes, 5-4

While the Duke varsity was being
handed a whitewash out on the Bluff
by the Panther tennis tea.m, the Du-
quesne freshman team rode out to
Oakland and slightly attoned for the
varsity misfortune by nosing out the
Pitt frosh tennisers, 5-4, on the Trees
gym courts Monday afternoon.

The little Dukes took four of the
six singles matches and one of the
three doubles engagements to pile up
their ﬁve points. The Panthers show-
ed superiority in the doubles events.

Only Larry Blatt and Bob Light of
the Panthers frosh could manage to
win in the singles. Blatt took Mc-
Colligan of the Dukes in straight sets,
6-4, 6-0, and Light did the same to
the Dukes’ Pringle,

In the doubles Kunkel and Blatt
teamed to add another Panther point
by licking Gardlock and Matejczak,
4-6, 6-1, 6-3,_ and Light and Hartman
made it two out of three by whipping

McColligan and Lyle in 6-3, 6-1 sets.
Shelton and R. Lewis, the Panthers‘
third double combination lost to Halo
and Mazer, 6-3, 8-6.

Alumni -Varsity Football Chips

After the grads put over a touch-
down in the ﬁrst quarter, the cohorts
on the bench stood up and gave them
the old honor salute as they returned
to lineup for the kickoff.

 

On the ﬁnal kickoff of the after-
noon, the former “greats’ couldn't de-
cide who should have the honor of
getting tackled, so after much later-
alling ‘from player to player, the var-
sity ﬁnally recovered the ball.

Most of the alumni started the con-
test with plenty of extra weight, but
the sun soon took that out of them.

 

Kenny Ormiston acted the same as
ever. Most of the Alumni tackles were
made ‘by the former star guard during
the ﬁrst half, and he even got in on
the receiving end of a lateral pass.

The grads appeared to use the
Kipke system of play, “Punt, pass,
and pray.”

 

Everyone in uniform got a chance

to play, making it hard for Harvey
Goldstein, who did the announcing.
Scorers in the press box had a tough
time deciding who scored the ﬁnal
touchdown for the varsity. No. 54 was
on two jersies, Miller’s and Cambal’s,
and for a while it looked as if Chicker-
neo might have been nominated. They

 
 

ﬁnally decided it was Cambal who
scored. Tourney
In spite of lack of practice and con- ,

ditioning, the All-Americans went;  Blank

ed hisheadgear at the ball, but Cam-
bal made good anyway.

Snyder Linksmen
Fail To Register
League Victories

Pitt Loses Final Conference Fray
To Penn State By 7-2 Count;
Souchak Triumphs Agmn

All the nice things said about the
Panther golfers at the beginning of
the season failed to show up again,
even in the ﬁnal conference match,

and the Panthers dropped Conference
Match Number 5 to the Penn State
linksmen, 7-2, up at Ithaca, N. Y., Sat-
urday afternoon.

The one bright spot on the Panther
side of the defeat was the showing of
the long-driving Frank Souchaok.
“Chow,” playing the No. 2 position,
drove out another impressive victory
over Bennett of State this time, 3 and
2. In conference competition Sou-
chak has banged out ﬁve victories in
as many starts, including a triumph
-over Billy Marks of Princeton.

Thus far this season Frank has a.
record -of seven consecutive victories
over collegiate opponents. Art Sny-
der, coach of the Panther squad,
claims Frank to be the longest hit-
ter he ever .saw, even taking into con-
sideration Jimmy Thompson, reputed
to be the pro -gam.e’s longest hitter.

Saturday's match was much the
same story as the Cornell match on
Friday, except that the State boys de-
dided to lay it on a bit heavier and
make it 7-2 instead of a mere 5-4.

Only two of the Panthers came
through with points for the Pitt total.
Souchak came out with a 2 and 2 vic-
tory ov_-er Bennett, while Sam Musico
added his second triumph of the trip
by downing Penn State’s Colletti, 2
and 1.

From there on the State boys gave
the Panther outﬁt a thorough cleaning.
Pat Symonds, No. 1 player, dropped
the opener to Alberek, State ace, and
Stevenson added another point by
licking Johnny Wasco of Pitt, 1 up.

Sigler of State defeated Panther
Bob Mease, 1 up, and Burkett whipped
Bill Baughman, 3 and 2, to ﬁnish the
scoring in the individual matches.
State added their other three points
by taking all of the best ball matches,

By losing the two week-end match-
es to Cornell -and Penn State, the
Panthers -closed their doings in the
Eastern Intercollegiate Golﬁng League
for the season. The Panthers lost
every one of the ﬁve league matches,
winding up the season with a percent-
age showing .000.

Since most of the defeats handed
them were close, the Panthers did
much better in their ﬁrst year in the
conference than the records show.
Souchak was perhaps the outstanding
individual player in the conference.

sets with the exception of one singles
match, the stron_-g Panther 'ten=ni-s
team shellacked the Duquesn-e Univer-
sity netters, 9-0, over on the Bluff
courts Monday afternoon. It was the
ﬁfth consecutive victory of -the sea-

Varsity Gridders, Lose 47-6

Matesic To Raudour Pass

Clicks For Alumni Score,

But Regulars Turn On Power In Second Half

Beef stock dropped a. few points last Saturda_\', but varsity stock
for next fall boomed as the football stars of former years and the
present Panthers swcltered through four periods of play in the ﬁnal

ﬂing of spring training.

The grads lost, 47-6, but the All-Americans‘

had a lot of fun and gave the varsity _sever-al uneasy moments.
Showing surprising form for a group of gridders who have done.
very little football playing since receiving diplomas, the alumni

pulled a coupleof fast ones on the
varsity in the ﬁrst few minutes of
play which gave them enough satis-
faction for the afternoon.

Frank Patrick's attempted ﬁeld goal
from the 28-yard line landed in the
end zone, and while the regulars were
grouped around Patrick, consoling him
on his unsuccessful try, Heinie Weis-
enbaugh quietly picked up the pig-
skin and started for the goal line

some ‘1-08 yards away. ~ By the time ~

he had reached mid-ﬁeld, some of "the
vars-it-y got wise to the fact that it
was a football game and stopped Mr.
Weisenbaugh on 28-yard stripe.

‘That made the _g1‘.8;d1S mad,  Matesic

score.

.a fresh team for the second period
with instruct-ions to handle the un-
d.ergrad~ua;tes .a little easier. While
the newcomers were still exchanging
handshakes, G.o'ldb-er,-g and Patrick
got -loose for long -run-s, the -latter tal-
lying the first ya-rsityscor-e. Patrick
kicked the seventh point, and the
half ended with the grads one point
behind.

Bloc-k Three Punt-s

Three blocked punts in the second
half ruined the .alumni’s chances.
Bomber Shaw got in front of two of
them in the third quarter, allowing
Matisi and Patrick to score. ‘More
grief to the grads and a further break
to the varsity came when one -of the
ofﬁcials, forgetting for the moment
that he was an alumnus, called inter-
ference on Sebastian -near the latter’s
goal line. LaRue carried the ball
over, making the score 27-6 as the
third qua-rter ended.

By the,time- the last period came,
Skladany, Onder, Quatse, and the rest
of the boys decided that it was high
time to take things easy. The ther-
mometer registered about 90 degrees,
and it was twice that ﬁgure in those
football uniforms.

At any rate, the varsity made three
more touchdowns, to increase the
total to 47. A pass from Stapulis to
Stebbins clicked; Ted Schmidt caught
a blocked kick and took it over for a
six-pointer; and shortly before the
gridders called it quits for the after-
noon, Clem Cambal rounded right end
for a marker.

Alumni Sit Tight

Nicksick yelled over to Bill Kern,

No, Professor Carver Hasn’t

Many Old Books, 163 Learns

By Jean Barnes

It started out, on the reporter's
part, as an assignment for a feature
story on the collection of old books
for which George Carver, professor
of English, has grubbed through shops
for some years. There were even a
few questions and answers on this
point, but Mr. Carver was modest.

“I don’t have many old books,” he
He hauled
three or four out of the bookcase and
showed the book-worm’s marks and
the yellowed pages.

But then he changed the subject,
and so was born a feature story.

“I do have some pretty nice.auto-

A graphed ones, that author friends of

mine have given me.

“Ruth Suckow, now, I have a copy
of her. ‘Country -People.’ ”

“What was she like?” said Leg
Man No. 163, Pitt News Special.

“She’s a surprising person. Looks
dry as dust, the kind of a person you
wouldn't want to know—~at ﬁrst
glance. But she’s full of vitality, and
real. Lives down in Arizona now.
When I heard she was going to get
married, I nearly fell over. She isn't
the kind of a person you connect mar-
riage with.

She is the daughter of an itinerant
minister; lived in 17 different little
Iowa towns before she was 18. She
really saw the life she writes about;
she lived it.

“Then I have a copy of Vachel Lind-
sa.y’s ‘The Chinese Nightingale.’
There's another surprising person. '1
was walking along State Street in
Chicago with him after midnight one
night—a Sunday night, it was—and
all of a sudden he threw back his
head and screamed, ‘The Congo,’ at
the moon, just bayed it out. That was
funny. Of course, there weren't
many people around. Even in Chicago
on Sunday night the streets are pret-
ty deserted.

“Rebecca West—I have one of her
books, ‘The Judge.’ She was out in
Iowa, lecturing, and she decided she
wanted to see what the farms and
the country were really like. She
wanted to see the purple loam in the
plowed ﬁelds, that she'd heard about.
I thought, ‘This is going to be easy.
I'll just hire a motorcar and drive her
around.’

“But, whoo-whoo! she didn’t want

Dr. St. Peter Talks

Dr. W. N. St. Peter will address the
Physics Colloquium at 9:30 this morn-
ing in Room 201, Thaw Hall, on the
subject “Recent Investigations on
Electrets.” The Physics staff is plan-

ning a picnic to be held in North Park
next Saturday afternoon.

to be driven. She wanted to walk.
We walked. She’s one of those small,
very dark, exquisitely-mannered per-
sons, but she tore me around the
Iowa countryside that day. When we
came to a. fence, she vaulted it. I
vaulted ’em too, but it took more
energy for me than it did for, her.

“I have two autographed books of
John Fredericks’, ‘The Green, Bush,’
and ‘Druida.’- That sketch up there
on the wall,”' he pointed it out, “is
the frontispiece to ‘The Green Bush.’
That’s the" original. The artist drew
it from the corner of Fredericks’
farm up in Michigan. They were just
clearing the rocks away, and you can
still see the stumps they have to pull,
in the drawing. How do you like that
slender tree in the center?” It was
almost just a straight line, but it cen-
tered the drawing, -

“Fredericks farmed his own farm.
He wrote ‘The Green Bush’ while he
was plowing. :He had a stenographer
perched on a fence at the one side of
the ﬁeld. fl-I-'e’d dictate a line, plow a
furrow up and one back down the
ﬁeld, and then dictate some more.

“Then I have a‘ copy of a book
called ‘Stories from the Midlands.’
It's an anthology. 1 have the auto-
graphs of every_one of the authors in
it. "Ruth Suckow was one.

“I knew Sherwood Anderson pretty
well too, but I don’t have any of his
books. It was funny the way he
started writing. He owned a washing-
machine factory in Ohio, in a little
town. One afternoon—about three
o’clock—he decided he didn't like
making washing-machines any more,
and he just walked out of the factory,
went to Chicago, and never came back.
The employee of the factory took it
over, and .tried to get him to come
back, but he wouldn't do it. Has a
farm down in Virginia now.

“Then I have copies of Edwin Ford
Piper's ‘Barbed Wire,’ a book of poe-
try; Hugh Walpole’s ‘The Cathedral,’
and ‘The_ Way of. Martha and the
Way of Mary,’ by Steven Graham.
And I have an autographed copy of
Theodore Dreiser's ‘The Financier’-
but I bought that.

“I don't usually buy books, unless
they’re on sale for a quarter. Usually
people give them to me.” .5

But from there on the talk wasn’t
about autographs; .it wasn’t an inter-
view; it was just a talk.

Jane Parsons, stenographer at the Bu-
reau of Business Research, to- W, VV_
