Pittnet: Getting on-line from residence halls now taster

Brett Taylor

Staff Writer

Students living in the residence
halls will now ﬁnd it’s easier to be con-
nected to the University’s computer net-
work than in past years. - .

The Residential Networking pro-
gram, known as ResNet, is designed to
provide students who live in the dorms
with "direct access to e—mail accounts
and the intemet without dialling in to a
server, according to Jinx Walton, direc-
tor of Computer and Information
Services,

This is done through aconnectiontp,
the school’s new Ethernet system, he
said.

The Ethernet is a connection
between one PC and a network of PC's.

A It’s usefulness lies in the fact that it’s

about 300 times faster than" the old
hookup. '

"This is a great convenience to the
students, and a selling point for the
University," Walton said. ‘

So far, over 2,600 rooms in
Litchﬁeld Towers’ A, B and C, along
with Lothrop Hall and- parts of
Sutherland Hall, have been connected to
the Ethernet, according to Walton. There
are only about 500 students who have
actually taken advantage of the technol-
ogy so far. There are around 80 students
waiting to have the service installed into
their rooms. «

Walton estimates, though, that
1,000 students will be using ResNet
within a month. '9

ResNet consultant Lee Bannister
said that students need two things in
order to get connected. e-

Now that Pittnet is installed, students |ike_ Kristen Panico and Gina Reynolds don't have to dial up with a modern.

First, they must have a computer
powerful enough to handle the Ethernet.
A computer that runs Windows '95 and
Windows NT 4.0 Workstation is power-
ful enough. For Macintosh users, com-
puters that run OS 7.5 or greater have

enough power to be connected.

Second, they must have an Ethernet
connection kit.

The kit consists of a circuit card for

First time at Pitt: 100 percent pass medical exam

Hillary Stevenson

Staff Writer

Pitt’s second-year medical
students are one step closer to
becoming licensed physicians.

The students were part of a
group of nearly 17,000 medical

' students who took the United

States Medical Licensing Exam
for the first time this summer.

Dr. Steven Kanter, director of
the School of Medicine, said all of
Pitt’s 133 students passed the
exam, which is given by the
National Board ' of Medical
Examiners. The students beat the
national pass rate of 93 percent.

"We are excited about the fact
that 100 percent of our students
passed. In previous years, our stu-
dents have usually scored very
high, somewhere between 96 and
97 percent," Kanter said.

Students took the exam in

June. It is the first of three parts’

given over the course of four
years of medical school.

Kanter said that each portion
measures knowledge of clinical
sciences and problem—solving
skills. To become a licensed
physician, students must pass all
four parts of the exam.

"It's something we as medical
students know we have to do. It's
stressful, but we spend two years
preparing for it," said medical stu-
dent Jonathan Hershlberger.

The intense preparation that
goes into this exam is not unusual
for medical students.

“We’re doing something we
normally do, but we’re just doing
it for a longer period of time,”
added Hershlberger. V

Administrators at the school

attribute the students’ success to
the "Physicians in 2000" program.
Since the school implemented the
program in 1992, the average
score on the exam has been at
least 90 percent.

"Physicians in 2000 is divid-
ed into several different parts,
including case—based study," said
Dr. Sheldon Adler, senior associ-
ate dean of the School of
Medicine and creator of the cur-
riculum. "The program allows the
student to take an active approach
to learning. It focuses on prob-
lem-based learning, small-group
work and self—directed courses. In
addition, the program stresses
interpersonal skills, which are
important when the student is
working one on one with
patients.’_’

Through problem-based

learning, students are exposed to
real situations and patients. This
method of learning helps students
with the medical-licensing exam,
because many questions on the
exam are drawn from actual situa-
tions. ,

"The learning experience is
an integrative one. Students have
a combination of lectures and
case—based study, all of which pre-
pares them for these exams,” said
Dr. Joan Harvey, associate dean of
student aﬁairs at the school.

Adler said the focus of the
program is to mold doctors into
people who can solve problems
and not simply repeat scientiﬁc
fact on an exam.

“We’re not interested if [stu-
dents] can memorize facts,” Adler
said. “We’re interested if they can
solve problems.”

He said

  

“we’re not
9 interested if ‘
[students]
can memorize

facts. we’re
interested if
they can
solve
problems.”

Boat with 400+ sinks in Haiti

Across the Nation

WASHINGTON '— Secretary of State
Madeleine Albiight is heading to the
Middle East tomorrow to reverse a set-
back in Arab—Israeli relations.

The week—long trip could be the

Clinton administration's last chance to .

jump-start negotiations between Israelis
and Palestinians.

The odds for a successful start are

slim, but a senior State Department offi-
cial says the alternative is "more" vio-
lence, more victims, lost hope."

Albiight said she intends to take a
tough line with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and with Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu.

Her message to Arafat will be to step
up arrests of suspected terrorists, disman-
tle terrorist groups and fulﬁll promises to
enhance Israel's security. Her message to
Netanyahu will be that concerns for
Israel's safety are no excuse to sidetrack
commitments to the Palestinians.

WASHINGTON —— The U.S. Justice
Department is dropping its case against a
Saudi dissident. ,

Hani Al-Sayegh supposedly had
information about the truck bombing that
killed 19 U.S. airmen in Saudi Arabia
last summer. Al-Sayegh later lreneged on
a promise to tell what he knows.

The Justice Department says it has-
n't come up with enough evidence to try
him in an unrelated conspiracy case.

ROMULUS, Mich. — A Texas woman
who committed suicide with Dr. Jack
Kevorkian's help wasn't mentally com-

petent to make the decision to end her
life, according to her brother.

Deborah Sickels' brother says she
had a history of emotional instability that
had been heightened in recent months by
family problems. -

Sickels' body was found early yes-
terday in a Detroit hotel where she killed
herself and ended her battle with the
eifects of multiple sclerosis.

Kevorkian’s lawyer says that
Deborah Sickels had been in counseling
for two months before her suicide and

dismissed her brother's criticism as "a

family member looking for publicity."
Around t_he World

MONTROUIS, Haiti — Survivors
believe as many as 400*people were
trapped inside a ferry that sank off the
central coast of Haiti yesterday.

Hundreds of others were reportedly
able to swim to shore.

Coast Guard officials in Haiti say
four bodies have been pulled from the
water, but the accounts from survivors
indicate that many more died. One sur-
vivor says the boat was overloaded, and
that it tipped over when passengers
moved to one side as the boat
approached shore.

Other survivors say that there were
no life preservers on board and that the
doors were bolted shut, preventing the
escape of many of the passengers.

On the pebbled beach of a ﬁshing
village, thousands of Haitians have been
wailing in grief as U.S. Coast Guard and
U.N. helicopters continue their search for
survivors 100 yards offshore.

use inside of the computer, and cables to
connect the computer to the wall jack. It
will cost students between $90 and
$150, according to a staff specialist
from the University's PC Center located
in Belleﬁeld Hall.

The popularity of the Ethemet's
capabilities has made it difficult for
local stores to keep the kit in stock.
Stores claim to have placed several

orders which they hope to ﬁll within a A

week.
Walton said her office worked the

first two weekends of the semester to-

facilitate the calls they received from
s_tudents who had their connection kits
ready to be installed.

"Once they get their connection

-kits, it's just a matter of scheduling. a

time when the students will be in their
room to have service installed," Walton
said.

According to Bannister, it is too
early in the semester to tell if the
ResNet computers will have any effect
on the number of students using the
University’s network. I

"Any traffic now is a result of the
increase in computer use that is seen at
the beginning of every fall semester,"
Bannister said. "By the end of the
month we should be able to see if
ResNet has caused any increase in the
amount of traffic.”

Michelle, a sophomore who didn’t
wish to give her last name, thinks the
new Ethernet is a good idea for students
like her who use the labs.

"If I had my own computer,” she
said, “it would definitely affect my
computer usage, especially the time of

day. .

For The PItt’News

After a semester of controversy,
Student Goverrtrnent Board members are
launching a campaign to rejuvenate interest
in the organization by coaxing students to
one of its more successful ventures -
town-hall meetings.

Last spring, board member Marquette
Bowman initiated meetings irt the William
Pitt Union for students and University of1"1—
cials to discuss common issues.

But after the former student—alloca-
tions chair, Noelle Carnpagna, made

_ numerous accusations that the SGB rrtis—

used student-activities money for its own
activities, the board was embroiled in con-
troversy.

"Because of SGB problems in the past

. school year, it's going to take some time to

get students to have a more positive attitude
towards SGB," said SGB President Justin

DalMolin. "We need some time to prove 1

our intentions through actions."

If the low attendance at last Thursday's
meeting is a sign of things to come, the
SGB may be facing the problem of another
campus issue — apathy.

Not even word of mouth, leaﬂets or
stacks and stacks of piping—hot pizzas could
draw students.

Although the SGB is planning numer-
ous events, many stndents are not respond-
ing well to the SGB's efforts, according to
DalMolin. '

But some students do not think these
actions are enough.

At the meeting, which was designed to
acquaint student-govemment members
with their constituents, only about 70 peo-
ple showed up.

Almost a whole pizza was available
for each person in attendance. Many of
those who stayed until the end of the’ meet-
ing walked away with leftovers from the
nearly 70 pizzas and 10 cases of soda that
the SGB ordered.

The SGB members are eager to hear

’ any student's concerns about Pitt, according

to DalMolin.

"As a board, we want to rebuild," said
DalMolin. "We want the students to let us
know their concerns because all input is
important to the SGB."

_ He said this meeting was one of many
attempts by the SGB to get more students
involved with student government and the
University.

Since the beginning of the year, SGB
members have attempted to make students
aware of the board's presence on campus
by setting up an information booth at the

‘ Activities Fair, holding a pregame bash for

the ﬁrst Pitt football game, and hosting the
town-hall meeting.

The SGB will also host a party on
Saturday, Sept. 20, the weekend before
Greek rush begins. A

"SGB is out of touch," said Damon
Hudac, a Pitt junior who attended the town-
hall meeting. "The SGB bought all these
pizzas and only left a $5 tip for two deliv-
ery people." ,

A Domino's manager, who declined to
give his name, conﬁrmed that the SGB
ordered the pizzas from his store, and that it
gave the relatively small tip to the delivery
persons.

Though the delivery persons may not
have fared well, the students who were in
the Towers lobby did.

Jen Molluso, an SGB board member,
and Justin DalMolin gave the extra pizzas
to students hanging out in the lobby.

Despite an apparent lack of interest in
the SGB on the students’ part, the board is
still promoting its events.

For example, they are promoting
freshman involvement in student govem—
ment. ‘David Eisenberg, the SGB's
Freshman Affairs Committee chairman,
wants incoming freshmen to realize that
they can participate in their student govern-

if
  Pizza, pizza: more students expected cit meeting

ment. .
The SGB will select the members of
the Freshman Affairs Committee this week.
Eisenberg says that freshmen who get
involved with the SGB can do moréyfor
their student body than high school stu-
dents involved in their student government.
"There is not a sense of hierarchy for
freshmen in the SGB," said Eisenberg.
"The SGB is looking for the best leaders
and communicators who have ambition for
the Freshman Alfairs Committee."
Because past Freshman Affairs
Committees, were not successful in plan-
ning events such as concerts and dances,

the SGB is implementing a workshop for

this year's Freshman Affairs Committee in
an attempt to prevent planning problerrts.

"This workshop will be held in order to
inform freshmen about how the SGB
works," said Eisenberg. "This workshop is
a blueprint that will change patterns of the
past Freshman Affairs Committees."

Students like Amy Bortz, a Pitt senior,
admire the SGB for its efforts to get fresh-
men involved in student government.

"I think the SGB's increased use of
public relations will contribute to a Pitt-
proud community," said Bortz. "The SGB
is making a lot of effort, and students
should take advantage of these eﬁorts." V

Where to go to tell
people how you feel

Things must be going pretty well. Apparently,
there are no big issues on campus right now
because almost nobody showed up for the SGB
town-hall meeting last Thursday evening’. If there
was something students were concerned about, they
would have gone to the meetingto express their
opinions to SGB members.

It is the job of the SGB to personally take our

opinions to those in charge. After all, the SGB’

doesn’t have a whole lot of power in itself, but its
members are the student representatives who deal
with administrators. ‘

Next to letters to the editor in The Pitt News, the
SGB is perhaps the main way that administrators

find out what are on students’ minds. Of course, if -

there were something on students’ minds, they
would all be going to the town hall meetings.

So, if nothing is going on, we can surely expect
all kinds of wonderful things to happen on campus.
Perhaps everyone will have time to take care of his
own, and the average QPA of Pitt students will
shoot up drastically this semester. Maybe the crime
rate will go down as students can concentrate their
attention on their own lives. This is not apathy; it’s
a very good thing, taking care of your own prob-
lems. If everybody did that, probably fewer trou-
bles would be blown out of proportion.

On the other hand, just in case any students do
have things they want to bring to the attention-of
the public, there are things students can do to be
heard. Of course, students can write letters to the
editor. The opinions pages of this newspaper can
serve as a finger on the pulse of Pitt’s student body.
Go to the SGB meetings. Tell our elected liaisons
what you want them to work on, what is important
to you, because they’ll listen. They have to. That’s
their job.

There is no reason that any-.

one should be standing so
close to me ‘that I can feel
that person breathing down
my neck. Thisbehavior is
especially popular in cafete-
ria lines and at the store. If
this happens, usually I will
let the line move until there
is a five-foot gap between
me and the person in front of
me. Then, I will take a really
tiny step, thereby annoying
the obsessive line—mover
behind me. (Try it. It’s fun!)

Class attendance should not be a part of the grade

Anne Estonilb I
 Nlanaglng E_dlt_or

c All instructors who take attendance:
Please consider these remarks before cany-
ing your threats to ﬁuition‘ this semester.
Having completed six semesters of courses,
I’ve found that mandatory attendance is a
useless tool for luring students into class.
Mandatory attendance and tardiness rules
often punish undeserving students and create
tension between students and instructors.

Everyone hates stragglers, those stu-
dents who disrupt lectures after class starts.

. They stand in the entrance,  for an

available seat in a crowded room and tend to
choose the most inaccessible seat. Noisy
desks and chairs scrape the ﬂoor until the
straggler settles in his desired seat A

When I open a door for myself, I
don’t expect that some other person
is going to be lazy and not open his,
own door on his own side. If every-
one observed the “move on the right
rule” I wouldn’t be late to class
because I was holding the door for
20 people. .

° To people who take their walkman

into the computer lab or library and
turn them up really loud: All those
other people in the room with you
are not deaf. I hopethat someday-all
the people who do this will either
become deaf or fail a final because
they can’t study due to someone

. else’s loud music.

0 To people who sit directly in front
of me in a classroom where every.
other seat is open: Your head is
NOT see—through! I know that I am
not the only person that this happens
to because I’ve observed it several
times. In fact, I have actually seen
students relocate to a different seats
because some idiot sat in 'front of

- them. (I do understand that this_is

unavoidable in classes where there
are few seats to choose — for exam-

ple, Psych‘ 15 in 120 David
Lawrence Hall.) .
Although this list might be

appreciated for its entertainment
value, it is a fairly realistic reﬂec—
tion of how brainlessly -people
behave every day. Of course, I can-
not deny that I am guilty of doing
some of these annoying things’
myself (particularly pen-clicking or
pencil—tapping), but atileast I admit
It ‘

O (Note to self: Try as hard’ as you .

can to tolerate people.)

Alison Novicki would like readers to
feed her strange hunger for lists of

“annoying things that people do” by .

e-mailing her at aenst2+ @pitt.ea_'u.

_ T But some professors go too far in trying
to prevent this disruption. They threaten

 letter gradesand fail11r'es.Orrtl1e

ﬁrst day of class, they offer one unexcused
absence to make themselves seem under-
standing. But after their gift of one free

absence comes the harsh reality of their

rules: Perfect attendance is the ultimate goal.

Looking back on the classes I’ve
skipped over the years, I notice that the class-
es most interesting to me were the ones I
attended religiously. Not surprisingly, great
teachers taught all those, classes. The subjects
varied indiﬂiculty. There were Organic I and
II, which I really enjoyed attending. The
ever-farnous Dr. George Bandik taught both
classes. He has an incredible way of making
synthesis frm, and I swear I’ll never forget
his bus analogy for steric hindrance.

- Then there was American Literature
with Profess0.I;_Susan Smith. I had read many

I ’ of the books befdre, but the class was so well

instructed that I attended all but two sessions.
One absence was for _a job interview, and the
other was because I was sick

A student who feels he can learn from
the class, whether it’s on neuroembryology
or ﬁlms, will attend the class. Students who
miss class after class either think the instruc-
tor doesn’t have much to offer or simply
don’t care. The students who don’t care will
fail anyway, so mandatory attendance is
pointless. These students will fail anyway if
the professor prepares the test material fairly.

I like professors who say that attendance
isn’t necessary but stress that the material in
their lectures isn’t found in the textbooks.
This tells me they really took the time to pre-

.

pare their lectures.

Now, I’m not talking about labs.
Frankly, if you’re not going toyour four-
hour labs each week, you don’t belong in the

class. But instructors who make attendance ,

mandatory to encourage class participation
’ar'er'r’t giving students enough credit
This is a university, not a high school.
‘Everyone who attends Pitt has chosen to
learn. Being dropped one letter grade for
three lates or absences just doesn’t make
sense. Either fail the student for poor work or
fail him for ‘lack of participation. Don’t pun-

~ ish him because the clock says he’s tardy for

the third time.

Anne Estonilo believes that she is the only
one who can decide whether or not she has
to go to class —— it is, cg‘ter all, her nickel.

Bucs still trying
to beat big-
market baseball

What do the Pirates think they
are doing?

Entering the season, the Pirates
were marketed as a team of “young,
hungry players.”

_More realistically, they were a

, financially strapped, small—market

team that by the end of last year’s
season had traded away its top five
players. To add to their dilemmas,
the Pirates lost Jim Leyland,
arguably the National Leagues
best manager.

These factors, translated into
lay terms, meant that they were
going to be bad. Just how bad, no
one knew.

They had no superstars, and
only one relatively proven player
"(left fielder Al Martin).
Understandably, most people
expected the worst.

They looked at the starting
pitching. They looked at the relief

pitching. They looked at the
defense and the lack of offensive
power.

Everything about the Pirates
was an unproven commodity (or
liability, depending on how you
look at it).

Yet something remarkable has
occurred during the season.

Yes, the Pirates are still young,
and yes, they are still hungry. And
to many people, the Pirates are also
unproven.

But amazingly, they are also
good.

They may not be as good as the
Braves or the Marlins, and granted,
they are playing in a weak division,
but to have suggested at the outset
of the season that the Pirates would
be immersed in a pennant race in
September would have seemed pre-
posterous. ' '

Much has been made of the
Pirates’ hard-nosed work ethic and
never-say-die attitude. But the
1997 Pirates have come back in
more games than other other team
in recent memory.

And they are doing damage not
with Albert Belle or Gary
Sheffield, but instead with players
such as Dale Sveum, Tony Womack
and Esteban Loaiza. These gentle-
men hardly cause opposing players

with losses on the road to
Clemson and Auburn, the
University of Pittsburgh

its games. The Panther

While the football team
was preparing for its battle
with Penn State’s football
powerhouse, the rugby team
was playing its contest
against Penn State’s rugby
powerhouse.

Penn State ended last
year as the No. ,2-ranked
rugby team in the country.
Unlike the football team,
PSU’s rugby squad lived up
to every bit of its billing by
thrashing the Panthers 43-5
just hours before the Pitt-
Penn State football contest.

Pittsburgh started
strong, keeping the game
moving back and forth with
the ball staying . around midfield
most of the time. The Panthers held
off the Nittany Lions for the first 15
minutes of the game.

The Pitt offense then pitched the
ball to Andy Markuns, who touched
it down for the Panthers’ first try.
This gave them a 5-0 lead, after
missing the conversion.

Pitt-Penn State action (without pads) started Saturday morning.

Penn State had sustained a push
lasting two or three minutes, and
finally touched the ball dog to tie
the match. They, too, missed the
conversion. Shortly after, the Lions
drove the ball and scoredfa try once
again, this time capturing the con-
version.

Panthers looked worn
out as the first half came
to an end. It was at this
time that Pittsburgh was
given another chance to
score. Corey Rosensteel
sprinted for the try
zone, but ran into a
brick wall resembling
two Penn State defend-
ers. '

In» the second half,

the, best rugby team in
the nation, not just the
second best. _

The Lions scored 31.
more unanswered points
and pushed the
Panthers, who offered
no resistance to the Lion
attack, all over thefield.

Penn State started its scoring
about 15 minutes into the half when
it crashed through the Panther
defense for seven points.

The Lions then reacted to a near
score by the Panthers by marching
down the field to score another try
and get the conversion.

The score was now 12-5 and the

Pittsburgh was never able to get

At times, the Panthers could not
even bring down the Lion ballcarri—

Rugby Club President Dave
Misiolek said the Nittany Lions
“were in better shape, and I don’t
know why.”

Both teams had only a week and

v a half of preseason training.
“We were not able to train in the"

summer because there were only
seven of us in Pittsburgh,“ Misiolek
said. . _
The team hopes to rectify this sit-
uation as soon as possible. Monday’s

practice saw the team running for 20.

minutes to get the players into game

happy about this outcome.

Misiolek insisted that “the team

away. I don’t -know where it went; it

Panthers, Purple Eqgles battle to scoreless tie-

Shannon Heim

yevening

For The Pitt News

The ouﬂook wasn’t brilliant for the

Pitt women7s soccer team that day — the
score stood 0-0 with but a quarter left to
play.

Saturday’s game against Niagara
University’s Purple Eagles wasn’t exactly
a fairy tale. There was no fairy godmother
to score the winning goal, _and there was
no happily ever after.

This was the women’s second game
of the season after a tough 1-0 defeat to
crosstown rival Duquesne last week. It
was in that game that freshman goalkeep-
er Nicole Bashor made her debut.

“Our goalie did very well [this
week],” Head Coach Roland Sturk said.

“But she wasn’t challenged as much as she
was at Duquesne.”

He added that one of the team’s
strengths lies in the fact that it has given up
only one goal in the two games played.

The game against Niagara proyed to
be primarily a defensive battle. The match
ended in a scoreless tie, despite many
eﬁorts by the Panthers’ offense.

Defense has been the highlight of the
women’s soccer team this season. Along
with Bashor, defenders such as sophomore
Kara Kunkle have come throughfor this
Panther team. VV1th the addition of more
offensive skills, Pittsburgh could be a con-
tending team in the seasons to come.

The team has already made tremen-
dous improvements from its 1996 season.

In that year, the team ﬁnished with a 3-16
overall record - ' ’

Sturk believes that it will take some
time for his team to play at its best, even
though his players are improving and get-
ting healthier with each game.

The team is composed primarily of
freshmen, which makes inexperience a
key factor in their level of performance.
Making the adjustment from a high school
level of play to the collegiate level takes

* time. These young athletes are also play-

ing on a team in its ﬁrst year of Big East
competition.
