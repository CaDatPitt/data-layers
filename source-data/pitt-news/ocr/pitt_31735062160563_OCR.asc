Students To Participate
In Carol Sing Tuesday

The Heinz Chapel will be the scene of a Christmas Carol
Sing on Tuesday, Dec. 17, at noon.

Chaplain Emory Luccock, stated, “In response to request
from students who have enjoyed singing in the Commons
Room, we are providing an opportunityifor all, regardless
of religious affiliation, to really. sing the mostfamiliar and

The Chaplain also said that he

_ hoped that the Sing would become

a Christmas tradition here at the

< University.

Highlighting the atfair will be
Italian, and German
carols, sung by the Heinz Chap-
el Choir under the direction of
Phillip Kniseley.

_ After these selections, all pres-
ent will join in singing ten famil-
iar carols. These will include “O
Come All Ye Faithful,” “The
First Noel,” “Joy to the World,”
“Silent Night," and “The Holly
and the Ivy.” A Christmas offer-
ing for CARE will be collected.

Dr. Luccock stressed the fact
that this opportunity has been
made available in response to
student demand. Two members
of the University football team,
right halfback Theodore and
center Charlie Brueekman first
suggested the program to the
Chaplain.

are welcome.

Food (In l[’.IaI;es

There has been plenty of con-
versation about the » food and
prices in the cafeteria and the
gradual deemphasis of the Tuck
Shop.

Students have grown into a
state of the sourest cynicism as a
result of paper cups and wooden
spoons in the Tuck Shop and the
high prices and monotonous
menus of the new cafeteria.

‘“- But nothing has undercut the
arguments of the administration
more during the past few days
than the rapidly circulating dam-
nation by one coed who said as
she stood in a Tuck Shop line,
“The cafeteria‘ is the place where
they serve Tuck Shop food on
plates.” I

Annual Fete

The annual C o m me n s
Room Christmas Party will
be held on Thursday, Dec. 19.

The program will open at
noon, with an introduction
delivered to the student body
by Dr. Alan C. Rankin, executive
secretary to the Chancellor.

‘ Immediately following the in-
troduction, a 49-minute Christmas
play will be presented. The play,
produced and directed by Michael
McHale, is titled, “The Second
Shepherd’s Play.” 5

This medieval comedy, which
was first presented in Wake-
ﬁeld, England, in the 19th cen-
tury, has become a traditional
Christmas play.

Although it is a typical early
English farce, the play combines
the joy and happiness with the
solemnity and sacredness which
characterize the Christmas sea-
son.

Participating in the program are
John Simon, Col. ’50; Ron Fields.
and Bob White, Col. ’59. Most of
the students in the play are speech
majors. \

The Heinz Choir, under the
direction of Philip Kniseley, will
take part in the play and pre-
sent, several numbers immedi- »
ately after the performance.

Chairman of the committee is
Pat Gramas, Col. ’60. Working on
the committee are Mary Alyce
Hamilton, Ed. ’58, social chairman;
Fred Whittier, Col. ’6l. arrange-
ments chairman; John Strauch,
Col. ’60, publicity chairman; and
Barbara Docherty, Col. '60, Pro-

Davill lawrence/1: Mr. (la y

There are few cities in this country that have been em-
barrassed twice in as many years by a r_noney—wasting and
illogical mass transit strike. A “

During the past fewweeks the hub of industrial Amer-
ica has shown itself at a loss to settle a dispute between the
two groups which so typifyits populace; Labor and Man-

i -agement‘.

At the pinnacle of dispair, after mediation and inter-
vention had failed, when the proposals of federal men
trained in settling such disputes had been rejected right
and left, when the customers, the employees and the man-
agers were in a state of frustrated immobility, one of Amer-

ica”s ﬁnest municipal leaders stepped in and ﬁnished off the
foolishness poste haste.

Since neithercombatant declared it within his range U

of responsibility to consider the people of Pittsburgh in the
struggle for pompous supremacy, it remained for the Mayor
to come to the aid of his public.

And, Pittsburghers should ‘note with pride, he rose to
the demand in the proper moment of decision.

He had waited until all normal methods of collective-

bargaining and mediation had collapsed hopelessly in the
face of the stubborn disposition of the Union and the Com-
Pany- ” ‘

Then he went to work in his own office with his own .

staff. The planning and, personal determination that has
energized the extensive rebuilding of this city solved its
biggest perennial, headaches.

It is this leadership which prompted Fortune to rank
Lawrence among the nation’s best municipal administrators.

The annual fall paralysis could be wiped out completely
if the company and the union had a similar sense of re-
sponsibility to the people who pay their wages and .make
their proﬁts.

Women, on the whole, not being particularly

For fellows who still have their Army tour of

Guide,” a recently issued paper-
back dealing with how to get
along in the Army should prove‘
of valuable assistance.
This guide is authored by

This was evidently a reference
to Ivy. contemporaries, Harvard
and Yale, which usually carry
tuitions very close, to that of
Princeton. Princeton’s tuitionof
$1100 with a $100 fee rests at a
level higher than most schools
in thevnation.

Yet their new‘president Go-
heen, until last year an assistant
professor, is urgently‘ “investi-
gating the possibilities of doubl-

 

ing’-the tuition rate” to rescue _

the “already endangered” teach-
ing profession.

Goheen believes that faculty
members at Princeton are sub-
sidizing “ a large percent” of the
cost of education through their
willingness to work at low pay.
The article in the Princeton daily

 

“This book is not
an expose; it won’t tell you the Army is rotten-
The Army isn’t rotten. It varies from post to post,
“i but, in each place, it’s the product of our country’s
needs and of the people who are in the Army . . .
This book will give you quite aafew hints, how-
ever, that may keep your ‘own Army life from

summer I learned one thing if nothing else, and
that is that the Army has its own way of doing
things. "

The “Draftees Guide” delves into such matters
as the draft, explaining the draft regulations and

chapter on basic training “gives a cross section of
what may be the grimmest and possibly the fun-
riiest, eight weeks of your life. It contains the mas-

 

The guide tells where to go for help, oliicial and
unoﬂicial. It explaips the nature of such things as
inspections, mess halls, duty rosters, pay call, KP,
the reception center, medical service, the chain of
command, and Army lingo. ‘*
Humorous Vein .

‘ Written in a free, relaxed, and often humorous
imanner, the guide will lessen the element of sur-
prise and shock encountered by recruits during the
first days of induction and basic training by pro-
viding an excellent insight into Army life.

Even veterans could get a charge out of some
of the humor used to illustrate the woes of the
lowly private. The following conversation begins
the chapter on inspections and formations.

“Sergeant Tucker, gig this man and pull his
pass for the weekend,” the lieutenant said.

“What for, sir?” the private asked.

“Junk in the bottom of your locker.”

“What junk, sir?”

“That picture doesn’t belong theré.”

“That’s not junk, sir: That’s a picture of my
fiancee.” A

 

up

states that “even non-scholar-

ship students” foot only 43% of ’

the educational costs.

Goheen emphasizes that it will-

not be possible to do this all at
once. But the best solution. says
he, would be to double tuition

-for all undergraduates over a

ﬁve year period. Simultaneously
feasible is “an average increase
in salaries of faculty members of
eight percent each year for the
next ﬁve years.”

The consequences of such a
move may well endanger an-
other necessary ingredient of
college campuses: a student
body. The total cost at Princeton
now is $2400-$2,500, their minim-
al ﬁgure, for each year.

Five‘ years from now, assum-
ing no change in room and
board, the complete cost each

"year will amount to $3500-$3600

more than the total income of
many American families. Now.
of course, an expanded loan and
scholarship program is spoken of,

but middle-income families will

be very hard hit.

The articles admit that’ such
an action might lower the “pub-
lic image of a place like Prince-
ton,”——indeed an understate-
ment. No public relations cam-
paign could change what» is a
fairly prevalent opinion about-
Princeton even today, that the
school is predominantly for sons
of higher income families.

This impression would be

j u s t l y magniﬁed. Princeton
would surely loseimuch of‘the
diversity of their present enroll-
ment. Students at Pitt should be-
thankful that our administration
has taken a more realistic ap-
proach totuition increase.

Moderation is necessary in
coping with this problem. If the
students pay 43% of the edu-
cational cost now, and their tui-
tion is doubled, theywill pay for
nearly the entire expense of
their education. What happens
to Princeton’s heavy ~-endow-
ment, alumni funds, foundation
aid, and industrial aid?

Perhaps other solutions should
be sought before strangulation
ensues. The most dangerous
aspect is that other schools might

_well emulate the Ivy School and

thuslimit themselves as Prince-
ton intends todo.

This is hardly‘ the way to a ‘

solution of the widely-discussed
problem of "the shortage of edup
cated manpower in this country
as‘ opposed 'to Soviet Russia.
-Princeton’s dilemna is not uni-
que. Other schools, including the
University of Pittsburgh, must
attempt to raise faculty salaries
or lose top mento industry.
However, unless some agency,
perhaps the federal government
begins a really inclusive scholar-
ship program, the country will
suffer from an ever-increasing
number of qualiﬁed individuals
without a higher education.

Letters To The

Editor, The Pitt News:

It has come to mytattention
that several residents of Schen-
ley Hall have been complaining
about the quality of the food
served at the Student Union.
Canards, -gentlemen; the mouth-
ings of malingerers. ‘

Any man who has not de-
veloped a taste—-nay, a palate——-
for chopped meat in nearly four
months simply hasn’t got a well-
rounded personality. And the
young men who refuse to eat the
Jell-O because it giggles when
touched are guilty of most un
collegiate vulgarity. o

Perhaps it will comfort the be-
leaguered authorities to know

  

that the res ectable element at

Schenley Hall is behind them in
a solid mass. A solid mass of
what, it is not my place to say.
But these young men do not eat
at the Student Union simply be-
cause they have to. They enjoy
their meals.

Perhaps only a few gourmets
really appreciate. the tang of
twenty-four-hour-old or a n g e
juice; but the braised steak is
devoured with shrieks -—— of de-
light, I have no doubt—-as is
the cube steak, minute steak,
swiss steak, baked steak, chop-
ped steak, and even the humble
hamburger.

Speech Clinic Teaches, Researches

1 Services Include

Three Campaigns
Against. Disorders
By ESTHER LATTERIVIAN

University Speech Clinic
was initiated in 1948, under
the directorship of Dr. Jack
Matthews. At that time it was
located on the 16th floor Cl.
where it shared oﬁices with,
and was a branch of the Psy-
chology Department. a

In the beginning, the service
aspects of the Speech Clinic were
designed to provide for the train-
ing and research programs as part
of the graduate school program in
Speech Theraphy.

,In 1950,” the Pennsylvania
Bureau of Vbcational Rehabilita-
tion and the Speech Clinic estab-
lished a relationship for the pur-
pose of providing clinical services
for people with speech defects.
This affiliation allowed the Uni-
versity to provide opportunities in
clinical procedures and research\
in speech disorders.

Threefold Purpose
The purpose of the Speech
Clinic has thus become three-fold.
The first plan is to provide train-
ing _ experience for prospective
therapists. S
This training is achieved by
combining academic classroom
work with actual experience in
the clinic. Students may ob-
serve corrective classes in pro-
gress as well as work with some
of the patients.
The second phase of the plan is
go carry on research activities to

discover knowledge and under-

standing of speech disorders. This
leads to new discoveries of met-
hods of speech corrective mea-
sures.

Community Service ‘

A service to community, stu-
dents, residents of Allegheny
County and the tri-state area to
provide therapy for anyone need-
ing it, is the third measure of the
three—i’old plan. ‘

Application for admittance
into the clinic is made by writ-
ten letter to the Speech Clinic.
Fees are charged for those who
are in a position to pay. A pa-
tient. however, is never turned
away from the clinic for ﬁnan-
cial reasons.

, Test Problem

Tests are then made to deter-
mine what the problem consists
of, and how it may have arisen.
An oral examination is then made

A to determine whether any defor-

maties or abnormalities for or-
ganic nature are present relating
to the speech problem.

Among the diagnostic and cor-
rective tests include: audiometer
tests, in which the patient’s
hearing is tested, as a possible
clue to a speech deﬁciency.

Another procedure used is the
'I‘hermati.c Apparation Tests, or
’I‘.A.'l‘. tests. as they are more
commonly known, which consist
of showing the patient pictures,
and questioning‘ him as to what
story he can gather from the pic-
ture.

Suitable Therapy

Therapy best suited for the pa-
ticnt, depending upon nature of
defects, skills and analysis of pa.-
tients feelings are taken into con-
sideration. The clinic, which has

MEASURE——Ed Martin, left, and Charlesllﬂim, both graduate stu-

 

dents in speech, are measuring the frequency response that human
ears can hear. The speech clinic on the eleventh ﬂoor provides
training experience, research, and therapy as its three-fold program.

18 therapists, combines efforts to
aid the patient.

The Speech Clinic has various
training procedures for its pa-
tients. Among these are prob-
lem groups, in which a therapist
assists a group in discussion pro-
grams, speciﬁcally designed to
get the patient talking in a
group, to relieve tension, and
become less self-conscious of his
speech problem.

Speech therapy at Pitt is a grad-
uate program, although some un-
dergraduate courses are offered.
To receive a ’master’s degree in
Speech Therapy is a one year
course of study. »

Students Participate
A PhD. is a three or four year

graduate program. During the
time the student is attending
graduate school, he has an op-
portunity to participate in the
program of operation of the
Speech Clinic.

The overall program of the
clinic, including service to the
community and University stu-
dents. teaching, and clinical
training has resulted in taking
care of approximately 50 to 60
people daily.

The clinic is headed by Dr.

Jack Matthews, director; Dr.
George Shames, associate direc-
tor, and head of the adult» pro-
gram; and Dr. Betty J. McWi1-
liams, in charge of the children’s
program.

Steel  Tour
Panthers Seek Bowl Winl
Over Duke,Miami,G.W.

By DAVID BREAKSTONE
_ The seventh annual Steel Bowl Basketball Tournament
highlights this week’s action in-district court circles. The four
team affair, hosted by the Panthers, will be an event of Fri-
day and Saturday nights at the Memorial Field House.

_The Blue and Gold cagers,
games of the season, are the

iye,‘ar’s event. Last December, the.

J u:ngle Cat ﬂoormen whipped Car-
negie Tech _and Duquesne to an-
nex their ﬁrst Steel Bowl title.

In addition to Pitt and Du-
quesne, theteams from Miami, of
Ohio, and George Washington will
The Redskins, from
Miami, are newcomers to ’ the
tourney, while the Generals ap-
peared in the 1954 competition
which they won rather handily.
The Dukes will meet Miami and
the Panthers take on G. W. in the
opening games on Friday evening.
The winners will meet Saturday
night to decide the 1957 champ.

Redskins Have Height
The opening tip-off on Friday

take place at 7:30 p.m. The ex-
perienced Dukes may ﬁnd the
team from Western Ohio more of
a problem than would be ordi-
narily expected. Though they
come from a small school, the
Redskin cagers are big league in
the brand of basketball that they
display.

Coach Dick Shrider’s players
are the defending champions in
the Mid-Atlantic Conference.
Last year their league record ’'
was 11-1 and the overall slate
boasted a 17-7 mark. The Red-
skins have a small college play-
er of the caliber of Steuben-
ville’s Jimmy Smith. He is 6 7"
center Wayne Embry whose
ambidexterous hook shots have
unsettled more than a few op-
ponents.

Embry was the leading scorer in

IF Volleyball

Last week at the stadium,
the inter-fraternity Volleyball
tournament was s t a r t e d .

A There are eleven Fraternities
participating in this tourna-
ment.

A team must lose two games to
be eliminated.

In the first round of this tour-
nament two of the eleven teams
were eliminated because of for-

' feit. They were Kappa Nu and
Phi Delta Theta. Delta Sigma
Phi and Delta‘ Tau Delta were

»de'clared the winners of these
games. .

In the other games Sigma Chi
beat Phi Epsilon Pi. Pi Kappa
Alpha downed Pi Lambda Phi
and‘ Phi Gamma Delta won their
game, against Sigma Alpha Epsi-
lon. ‘

The second and third rounds of
this tournament will be played
this week while the final round
will be played some time next
week.

Delts In Title Play

In touch-football Delta Tau
Delta defeated the Dental School

' entry in the semi-ﬁnals of Pitts
intra-mural league. The score was
8-6.

Scoring for the winning Delts
were Jim Donahue who scored
the touchdown while Pat Mc-
Can caught an opponent behind
his own goal to add the two
points. Delta Tau Delta will
play the Electrical Engineers for
the school title.

Gymnasts Practice Daily

  For Upcoming Season

By LARRY HAGGERTY
Coach Warren Neiger, who is starting his sixth season
as the Blue and Gold gymnastics coach, is busily preparing
his squad for the upcoming season. “The team usually prac-

tices about ﬁfteen hours a week,” commented Coach Neiger. ‘

The Panthers will be starting their third season in the

Eastern Gymnastics League. When Neiger ﬁrst came to Sky— f

scraper U., the Panthers lacked a:

gymnasticteam, but in ﬁve years
the Jungle Cats have risen to
ninth in the nation.

The gymnsts posted a 6-3 rec-
ord in dual meet competition last
season and will be striving to bet-
ter that mark. The Panthers sur-
prised most experts, by ﬁnishing
third in the Easterns last March
after a mediocore campaign.

Penn State Tops

Syracuse will be the Blue and
Gold’s ﬁrst opponent this season
when they meet the Panthers at
the Field House on January 18.
Other home meets are with Tem-
ple on February 8, and the Moun-
taineers of West Virginia on Feb-
ruary 25.

“Without a doubt the three
_ toughest meets of the season are
with Penn State, Army, and
Navy, and all three must be met
away from home,” voiced Coach
Neiger. Penn State is the de-
fending Eastern and N.C.A.A.
champions.

Neiger has named Tom Darling
and Jack Hammond to serve as
co-captains. Darling is the
N.C.A.A. champion on the, ﬂying

rings and is also expected to add.

some valuable points on the hor-
izontal bar too.

Hirst Leading Scorer

Hammond, who underwent a
knee operation between cam-
paigns, scored 951/2 points last sea-
son and captured ﬁve ﬁrsts in dual
meet competition. He will compete

on the ﬂying rings and in tum-

bling, but his specialty will be the
parallel bars. .

Dave Hirst, last campaign’s
leading scorer with 111 points,
is back again and will take part
in tumbling, ﬂying rings, and
the parallel bars. His 111 points
established a Panther record for
the most points scored in a

Ping Pong Squad
Ratedln Top Ten

The Panther ping pong team,
which is rated third in the na-
tion, is striving to maintain their
high national ranking. The Blue
and Gold achieved this distinction
by ﬁnishing third in the Nation-
als at Boston las‘ season.

Boston College and the Phila-
delphia Textile Institute are the
two teams ranked above Sky-
scraper U. The Panthers have
gotten off to a good start by
sweeping three out of four meets.
All opponents will be r.et away
from home again because the Jun-
gle Cats lack the proper facilities
to play at home.

The Blue and Golds are most
impressive win to date was an
11-10 upset of the South Park
squad. The Parkers have the
number one rated player in the
state on their team, but the
Panthers grabbed an early lead
and hung on to win. ,

The table tennis experts have
an upcoming meet in Greensburg
on December 16. From February
1-6, the team will take part in
an intramural tournament at
Michigan State.

Fred Ackerman heads the six
man delegation. His teammates
are Herb Sorolvitz, Inya Lee,
James Leung, Maurice Fried,
Julius Gomez, and ‘Carlos Angulo.
Gomez and Angulo hail from Co-
lumbia while Lee and Leung come
from Korea and China respective-
ly.

Sorolvitz competed in the Na-
tionals last year and advanced to
the semi-ﬁnals before being de-
feated. Both Lee and Leung have
played in the Oriental Tourna-
ment in .Hong Kong several times
before to Skyscraper U. .

single season.

“Darling, Hammond, and Hirst
swept the Eastern Finals in the
flying rings so this will naturally
be our strongest event,” stated
Neiger. “However, I think we
have an equally good chance to be
just as strong on the parallel
bars.”

The Blue and Gold’s main hope
on the horizontal bar will again

be Jim Mulvihill who captured’

seven ﬁrsts and registered 89
points. Don Neeld, a returning let-
terman, is expected to pace the
tumblers while John Cacolice
leads the rope climbers.

The best prospect on the side-
horse is Sophomore Don Kasner.
John Marcinko, who isn’t eligible
until February, should help on the
parallel and high bars. Don Shi-
ma, who was forced to sit out last
season, will probably be returning
to the squad.

ANY NORMAL DORM’LL be full of Lucky
smokers! You can count ’em by carloads
on any campus —— and no wonder! A
Lucky, you see, is a light smoke-—the
right smoke for everyone. It’s made of
nothing but naturally light tobacco A
golden rich, wonderfully good-tasting
tobacco that’s toasted to taste even’ bet-
ter. Find a set of dorms without Lucky ,
smokers, and you’ve stumbled on a
‘mighty Odd Quad! Don’t you miss out——-
light up a Lucky. You’ll say a light
smoke’s the right smoke for you!
