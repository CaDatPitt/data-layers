Improvements In
Registration
System Sought

By BILL HESS

Long lines during registra~tio'n
may soon be eliminated as Pitt
further utilizes computer technol-
ogy. In fact, it may someday be pos-
sible for students to actually
register by computer during meet-
ings with their advisers.

According to Assistant Registrar
Dennis DeSantis, computer devel-
opment being studied for the
Registrars’ Office will eliminate
many disadvantages Pitt students
now must face. i i A

The improvements, said DeSan-
tis, will be made possibly by the
DEC-10 computer system that the
university is currently developing.
The new system would form a cen-
tral administrative brain in which
biographical student information
could be stored.

“This would eliminate the prob-
lems caused by having this infor-
mation stored separately by several
offices." DeSantis said. “With the
current system, something like a
change of address has to be pro-
cessed by different offices. With a
central. system, the change would
only have to be processed once.”

Another improvement the devel-
opment effort will make possible is
the enhancement of transcripts,
which are processed in the Regis-
trar’s Office.

Reaganomics——the supply-side
economic theory advocated by
President Reagan--is based on
three fundamental principles that
demand that U.S. citizens reexam-
ine the federal governments role in
and approach to alleviating the
nation's economic woes, according
to Dr. James Burnham of the
Council of Economic Advisors.

These three principles of Reaga-
nomics are: a more comprehensive
view of the federal governments
role economically; a warier view of
what economics can do; and a view
that is long term in focus.

“First we must begin with a com-
prehensive view of what exactly the
federal government should do. As

he stated in his inaugural speech, .

“The goal of improving tran-
scripts would be to provide a better
service for the student,” said
DeSantis. “With better transcripts,

- we can improve a student’s chance

on the job market.”

The problems with the current
system, DeSantis explained,
involve the amount of information
contained in transcripts and ineffi-
cencies in production. Currently,
adhesive grade labels must be man-
ually placed on a student’s official
transcript. Also, any corrections
must be made manually by a
typewriter. The aim of the new sys-
tem, according to DeSant“is, would
be to computerize transcript
production.

Computerization would also

~make it possible to place more

information on a transcript. Cur-
rent transcripts don’t list
cummulative quality point aver-
ages and the course descriptions

contain too, little information,
DeSantis said.
According to 'DeSantis, the

development effort will eventually
lead to irnprovcments in the regis-
tration system itself. Class open-
ings are Currently determined by a

Profile: Ted Windt, Speech Professor

Ted Windt

By FRANK DIGIACOMO

He walks briskly down the
aisle of David Lawrence Audi-
torium, the belt of his light
brown trenchcoat trailing in
the whirlwind he creates. His
slightly hunched appearance
does not give the impression of
poor posture but instead of con-
stant alertness—a poised readi-
ness. Upon reaching the
podium he removes his charac-
teristic sunglasses with a flour-
ish that would ..make a Royal
Palace Guard envious and in
the same fluid movement puts
the shades away while bran-
dishing yet another pair of read-
ing specs.

The execution is always flaw-
less and occasionally brings
scattered applause from the stu-
dent audience. This ritual com-
pleted, Dr. Theodore Windt, Jr.
utters the words, “Let’s pick it
up,” and immediately grabs the
undivided attention of his 529
Presidential Rhetoric students.

To call Ted Windt one of the
most popular professors on
Pitt’s campus would ‘be grossl
superficial, almost derogatory
statement. Windt’s aim is not to
be popular. He says. “My first
responsibility is as a teacher
here at the University of Pitt.s-
burgh, and I work hard at my
teaching. Second, in order for
me to be a good teacher I must
also be a good scholar. You
can't separate scholarship from
teaching——you have to know
your stuff. If rm not a solid
scholar then I can’t be a good
teacher.”

A native Texan, Windt began
his pursuit of scholarship at
Texas Lutheran College where
he received his undergraduate
degree in English. He earned

his M.A. in Theatre Arts at
Bowling Green State University
and acquired his Ph.D. in Rhe-
toric, Theatre Arts and Philo-
sophy at Ohio State University.

Windt’s doctoral thesis on
Russia’s Nikita Krushchev was
the first dissertation of its kind
in his discipline and opened up
the field of soviet rhetoric.

Soviet studies is not the only
field of rhetoric Windt has
inaugrated. When he came to
Pitt in l968, Windt taught a
graduate seminar on the 1968
presidential campaign. At the
end of the year he was asked to
expand the course to an under-
graduate level. He declined
because he felt the course would
be too limited. However, in
1970 Windt pioneered the for-
mation of a class in presidential
rhetoric, initiating yet another
field of intellectual study.

“At that time there was only
one Presidential Rhetoric
course and it covered the
speeches of Johnson and
Kennedy, and Nixon who at
that time was riding in high
popularity," he says. “Back
then, the class had 25 students.”
Windt smiles, perhaps because
of the fact that since then, the
class has had to be expanded to

iCOV€I' [W0 S€ITl€Sl(‘I‘S VVICII an

average class size of approxi-
mately 500 students.

Windt is also celebrated as a
publishing scholar and a rhe-
toric critic, particularly for his
studies of rhetorical genres. In
the Nov., i975 issue of Speech
Monographs in an article by
James W. Chesebro and Caro-
line D. Hamsher entitled “Con-
temporary Rhetorical Theory
and Criticism: Dimensions of
the New Rhetoric,” Windt is
recognized as one of eight critics

who have been instrumental in
the development of the “New
Rhetoric.” One of Windt’s arti-
cles entitled “The Diatribe:
Last Resort For Protest," is
referred to specifically:__
Windt observes that the
diatribe captured a ‘way of
life, mode of thought’ as
well as reflecting the intel-
lectual, strategic, and ethi-
cal features of the Cynics.
Windt explicitly reveals
the assumption governing

the holistic perspective of_,_

these contemporary rhe-

torical critics: ‘Thought‘

language and action are
intimately reflected. With-
out language there is no
thought.’

Although ‘Windt’s sense of
modesty tends to keep his state-
ments limited only to those that
can be shown through docu-
mented fact, he will, if pressed,
begin to reveal a little about
his personal views concerning
his career philosophy.

“Back in Texas there are two
types of oil-men,” he says with a
smile as he lights up a cigarette.

“'I‘h§g:_’s the one th‘at_p£1ys it J,
safe and is pretty certain that 

there is oil on the well-site

before it starts to drill. Then I

there's the ‘wildcatter’-the rio-
tist type—Glenn McCarthy
comes to mind. He was the
model for the character James
Dean played in the screen adap-
tation of Edma Ferber’s Giant
(there is a poster of Dean on the
wall in Windt’s office). Well, I
see myself as a ‘wildcatter,‘
intellectually. Particularly as a
critic, I like tojump around and
open up new fields of study.”
In addition to his immersion
in the academic environment of

rhetoric, Windt is also very
much im"olvedpolitically, both
as a speech writer and consul-
tant. He has been the presiden-
tial analyst for radio station
KQV since 1979 and has
appeared as_a_ political an_d_rhe-
torical analyst for KDKA’s Wee-
kend Magazine. He is also a

member‘. of the National Task .

Force on Presidential Com-
munications. In addition,
Windt was Governor Thorn-
burgh’s chief speechwriter dur-

,;..§L1_g the l978 primary campaign
(kg-and will subsequently, be an

advisor to him during the gen-
eral election. He would not
reveal the names of any other
candidates he had worked for,
saying that, “What I do is very
sensitive, (so I try to stay as invis-
ible as possible.” -
Windt maintains that in
order to be a good speechwriter
one must be a "sensitive sty-
list.” It's a very complicated
process. You have to pick up on
the candidates’ idioms, stylistic
devices, and key words and then
write the way he talks,” he says.
“You can't have two different

ﬁndidates up there or it will

(ﬁne across as phony and the
public will pick it up like that.
You just can’t allow that or you

won’t last long. I think one .

thing that helped me was when
I was in_the theater,” he says. “I
wrote plays and did a lot of
characterizations. Conse-
quently, by the nature of the

theater, . I gained’ a" A lot of -

sensitivity.”

 

 

Wintlt's sensitivity also spans
another issue—prejudice. He
has an extreme hatred of racial
discrimination. “There is no
place in our democratic society
for prejudice,” he stresses. ‘‘It is
also not going to be solved with
the passage of a few Civil
Rights acts. Coming from the
southwest, Windt was reared
with_«the issue of prejudice and
had to face it. Consequently, he.
became very involved with dis-
crimination issues.

For example, while he was
teaching at the University of
Texas at El Paso, Windt was the
faculty advisor of the UTEP
Afro-American group, one of
the first Black action societies to
be formed. It was his involve-
ment in this group, especially
during the weeks following the
tragic assassination of Dr. Mar-
tin Luther King, _]r., which led
Elroy Bode, in an article
entitled “The Rhetoric of
Revenge,” that appeared in the
April 29; 1968 issue of Nation
Magazine, to recognize Windt
as a “self-styled nonviolent
revolutionary” in the fight
against prejudice and racial dis-
crimination. . . _

One cannot ignore thefacts.
figures and. trivia surrounding
Windt‘s Presidential Rhetoric I
and II classes. The class is an

'elective- for most students--a

requirement only for a speech-
/rhetoric degree. In addition,
Windt doesnot curve his grad-
ing scale—-something’ that
would be the kiss of death for

DANNY’S PUB

 

most electi\_'e classes. Yet, every
semester approximately 200 to
300 students are turned away
because the class has already
reached its quota of approxi-
mately 500. It has been esti-
mated that approximately
one-fourth of the entire Pitt stu-
dent body has taken one of
Windt’s classes (approximately
4000 students).

Naturally, Windt refuses to '

comment on this phenomenon.

Perhaps the rarity can be"

explained by an unidentified
student who comments, “He
has a quality which is difficult
to achieve not only for profes-
sors and instructors but for any
speakers in any speech setting,
and that quality is charisma.
“He establishes a charismatic

relationship between the stu-

dents and himself,” sire’ con-
tinues, “which means he has
been able to make a subject
which has potential for being
dull into a subject which is
interesting, even enjoyable,
through a combination of sub-
ject matter and his own style.
It's difficult to describe what he
does because it's unique, but ifl
had to pinpoint it in one word
then it would have to be ‘charis-
matic.’ ”

Budget? Proposals

By LAURIE MACLEOD
Hearing’s to review student
organizations’ I983
budgets took place at the Student
Government Board (SGB) Friday.
In addition to accepting its own

budget, SGB accepted the budgets _

for Academic Affairs Committee,
Allocations Committee, Comuter
Affairs Committee,
Government Elections Committee,
Governmental Relations Commit-
tee, Legal Awareness Committee
and the Student Government judi-
cial Board.

The Board rejec_ted the Student

Relations Committee-’s budget-r

because of error’s made in allocat-
ing money for advertising. This
budget will be presented again at
the next SGB meeting.

Individual budgets ranged from
$258.72 (Student Goverment Judi-

fiscal year A

Student?

cial Board) to $35,286.05 (Student
Government Board).

The budget includes unres-
tricted travel account with the stip-
ulatiorrthat each trip must be voted
at a public meeting and signed by a
Allocations Committee liaison.

It also includes unrestricted Pitt
News ads and’ food services, and
pays salaries for work study per-
sonnel and a full time secretary.

In other business, SGB accepted

a proposal made by board member
Chip Roth to amend the athletics
policy that was accepted several
weeks ago.
I The ammendment deletes the
statement “travel expenses and
tournament fees will be subsidized
up to 25 percent, excluding food
and lodging," and adds that no
intercollegiate athletic competi-
tion will be funded.

amount of radiation during the
T.M.I incident has caused the defo-
liation of trees and increased inci-
dence of children born with
hypo-thyroidism, malformed
animals and birds and psychologi-
cal depression in area residents.

President Reagan is planning,
according to Gordon, to convert

g every nuclear plant into a bomb-

making factory by setting up a pro-
gram for reprocessing the
plutonuim generated by the plants.

Bill Tomen, who investigates

and analyzes nuclear accidents for
Westinghouse, pointed to the
nation's dependency on foreign oil
imports, claiming that every fam-
ily of four pays $1,600 per year 1‘
foreign imports. ‘
The American Medical Associa-
tion did a study compiling the total
number of accidents, and the possi-
bility of accidents for all energy
sources, according to Tomen, and
found that the least risky fuel
source 1S burning natural gas, the
second least risky is nuclear power,
the third is burning oil and the

sics Professor Bernard Cohen argued for nuclear power at

Friday’s debate.

fourth is burning coal.

“Putting things into perspective
means that there are heavy penal-
ties to pay for the alternatives to

-nuclear power,” he said.

The Union of Concerned Scient-
ists reported that the radiation
releases at T.M.I. were so small that
there were no health risks Tomen
said.

Hord’s opposition to nuclear
power is from the point of view of
those who have to work with and
transport dangerousrcargo.'He said
he would like to see a workers’
movement in which employees
would refuse to work with radio-
active materials. '

Coal is a viable alternative to
nuclear power, according to Hord.
He said he is opposed to nuclear
power base because'of its threat to
employment levels and it’s'c0nnec-
tion with the war machine.

Saying he had nothing to gain by

‘supporting nuclear power, Cohen

offered $50 to anyone who could
prove that this energy resource is
more dangerous than coal.

Cohen pointed to the media cov-
erage of the topic as‘the reason for
pulic oppdsition asking,“Howfan
everyone be such suckers?"

“Where are all the dead bodies
you guys are talking about?”
Cohen asked. “The public has been
driven insane by the if fear of

. radioactivity.”

If the whole country were run by
nuclear power the risk would beno
greater to an individual than if he
smoked one cigarette, according to
Cohen. At the conclusion of the
debate, questions and statements

During the question and answer

dents around T.M.l.; radioactive

Cost Reduced For

Semester

By COLLEEN MAYOWSKI

‘For the price of one semester s
tuition, room and board, qualified
students can trade their stationary
campus in Oakland for a floating
campus with an itinerary that
includes japan, South Korea, Tai-
wan, Indonesia, India, Egypt,
Israel, Greece and Morocco.

Augmentation grants, provided
by the Institute for Shipboard Edu-
cation and awarded by the Univer-
sity Center for International
Studies, reduce~the cost of _a stu-
dent’s participation in the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh-sponsored
Semester at Sea’ from $8000 to
$21l0—the cost of tuition, room
and board at"Pitt for one semester.

“The sad thing is that there are
probably hundreds of qualifed stu-
dents at Pitt who simply don’t
know about augmentation
grants,” said Angi Yucas, associate
grants advisor for the University
Center for International Studies.

To qualify, students must be
full-time undergraduates of at least
sophomore standing, have a 3.00
QPA, and be able to demonstrate
financial need and the relevance of
a Semester at Sea to their educa-
tional or career goals.

“We‘re looking for superior stu-
dents who can demonstrate-finam
cial need,” said Yucas. “This

AtSea

program is a genuine effort to
attract excellent students and pro-
vide them with a unique academic
experience for the cost of a semester
in Oakland.”

Depending on budgetary consid-
erations, the University Center for
International Studies will select
from three to five students who will
be awarded augmentation grants
for next fall’s voyage, said Yucas.
Five Pitt students received aug-
mentation grants for the current
semester aboard the S.S. Universe
which. is in its second week of
travel. . E

“‘They were so excited,” said
Yucas. “They were about to begin a
rare experience. In the coming
weeks they’ll have unrivalled
opportunities for above-average
academic experience, not to men-
tion opportunities for personal
growth and social development.”

“The 21st century will be based
on global interdependence. These
students are fortunate enough to be
gaining a first-hand appreciation
of this,” Yucas said.

Students who feel they may qual-
ify for an augmentation grant
should pick up a Semester at Sea
application from Yucas in 4Gl2
Forbes Quadrangle. The applica-
tion deadline for the fall semester

V voyage is March 22. ‘

ultimate development for us.”

All of the proposed improve-

stage. Because of this, it is too early
for anyone to predict which ideas
will aciually be implemented.‘

“The whole matterof develop-

director of the CAS advising center,
supports the idea.

the president’s policy focuses on
theories of both local and federal
governments,” said Burnham who
lectured at Pitt on Friday. “It’s time
to recognize the economic implica-
tions of the states’ having created
the federal government. and mm
the other way around._

‘‘On ‘a microeconomic level,
there is a role - for the federal
government in insuring the con-
tinuation of _public goods," said
Burnham.' “The president views
income redistribution as a public
good, and the federal government

“does have limited responsibility in

this area. _It must provide basic liv-
ing standards for the deprived.

“On a macroeconomic level, the
federal government does have
responsibility for destablizing
actions which affect the economy
overall. For example, difficulties
with regional mass transit should
be handled regionally,” Burnham
said. “This type of policy doesn’t
operate in one fell swoop, but by.
reducing government activities in
this area gradually.”

Redefining thefunctions of the
federal government includes using
increased restraint involving
government interventions, Burn-
ham said. “Just because there is a
market failure doesn’t mean the
federal government should neces-
sarily step in. There is a case for
government intervention, but
actual occurrences are limited.
When the need does arise for inter-
vention, it should be at a level
where it's most needed for the
problem.” .

Burnham stressed that areas in
which the federal government has
unique responsibilities should not
be _ignored as a federal function.

One “clearly_ cut case” is that of -

national defense. “The president
sees this as being a‘ federal top
priority because we are danger-

ously lagging behind, as well as its

being a uniquely federal responsi-
bility,” Burnham said..

Burnham said he believes that
defense budget criticisms are
“badly overdrawn” when com-
pared to past military outlays as
percentages of total budget and
overall GNP.. V

Secondly, Burnham emphasized
that we must be cautious of what
economics can and cannot do.
“Given the realities of the world,
the slowness of institutional and
economical response, the ability to
manage affairs solely by means of
applied economics is not there.”

cent.”'Expectations by the people
are crucial in the long term focus
because “any lack of credibility
could change the expected period
of economic adjustment.”

The “four pillars” of Reaga-
nomics, as Burnham defines them
are’: reductions, in personal and cor-
porate taxation; slow increases in
federal spending; regulatory
reform; and monetary restraint.

“President Reagan says that per-
so_nal tax cuts are central to his eco-
nomic prograr’n.‘Combined with a
lower inflation rate, this should
produce an increase in personal
savings due also to increased sav-
»i_t1_gs‘ince_ntive_s,” Burnham says.

“The president thinks of defense as a unique
federal responsibility,‘ so spending is justifiable
there. In other areas where government services
are provided, the users should pay for them.”

says, is “Don’t just stand there,
undo something.”

Trying to fine-tune areas of cor-
porate responsibility (an;example
of the do something approach)
doesn’t work, says Burnham,
claiming also that trying to fine
turn the economy has _led to higher

‘inflation and lower productivity.

He quotes President Reagan as say-
ing, “We are not interested in sec-
toral, regional policies. What
concerns me is the overall effect of
business with-' minimal govern-
ment intervention.”

As to a long term focus, Burn-
ham says that the president is cur-
rently practicing this. “He’s trying
to get a program in place which
includes three years of tax cuts.
Creating a long run program of
this nature should soon have mar-
ginal tax rates reduced by ten per-

“Reduced biisiness taxes will

equipment," Burnham states. He
mentions that because of these it w
tax breaks, the. corporate ‘after-tax
rate of return is higher than the
before-tax rate of return. “Could
this situation be improved? Per-
haps,” says Burnham.

To slow the increase of federal
spending,’ “a major reorientation‘
as _to where the budget goes” must
occur. “Cutting non-entitlement,
non-defense areasis what redefin-

spur the purchasing of new caxial

- ing the federal government is all

about.” Pointing out that govern-
mental spending was 23 percent of
last year’s GNP, Burnham com-
ments, “Governmental outlays are
too high. To create jobs, you don’t
spend money.”

“The president thinks of defense
as a unique federal responsibility,

a-s>~ /2::-1*‘; . "

so spending is justifiable there. In
areas where government services
are provided, the users should pay
for them.” Burnham continues,
“Certain programs should be
transferred back to the state, pro-
grams which will then be financed
with revenues from excise tax for-
mulas. These excise taxes are to re-
store to the state a tax base that the
government has been using to
finance such programs." Burnham
adds that “it’s hard" to make many
programs qualify as “public
goods.”

In the area of regulatory reform,
there are two specific types of regu-
lation involved: economic and
social. ,

Economic regulation applies to
transportation, communication
and financial services. Burnham
says, “To permit more expendi-
tures in these areas, barriers must

" be removed. Deregulation must be

encouraged.

Defending Reagan's social regu-
latory reforms, Burnham says,
“We’ve simply tried to emphasize
that we can achieve these at lesser
costs.” _

“There has been a wave, a prolif-

eration of obtrusive regulation,

and that wave has been slowed.
Agencies are now examining
other, less expensive means of
enforcing regulations.” '

This is where supply-side eco-
nomics steps in, Burnham adds.
“Resources that have been chewed
up in these programs are used
elsewhere.”

When it comes to federal mone-
tary policy, Reagan agrees with the
federal reserve board's practice of
monetary restraint. “Lower money
growth is essential for the reduc-

-‘tion of inflation. Past attempts at

wage/ price guidelines and freezes ,

have been ineffective.” ’
President Reagan follows a tight

. money/loose fiscal policy philo-
sophy. Burnham sees spending as,

 2-«  >~« "5 i

1982

ck Bar 10am - 4 

in

CS

one of the economy’s “fundamen-
tal problems.”‘Money growth is
another. '

“Which does more damage, sel-
ling bonds or- raising taxes? We
believe that a non-monetary debt,
such as bonds, is less of a threat to
economic prosperity than higher
taxes."

The impact of these economic
decisions on interest rates is two-
fold. “The market rate (rate at
which businesses borrow) will
resume its downward trend. Real
rates (those of the_public) will be
above average, which will encour .g
age saving in traditional forms,
such as savings in banks, (as com-
pared to untraditional forms, like
houses). ,

Burnham says that they are not‘
concerned about the large deficit,
except that they “run the danger of
losing sight of the apparent need
for restraining-spending. We must
keep restraint on spending.”

\

ﬁr

Reaganomics, according to‘

Burnham, believes in the “signifi-
cantly smaller role of the govern-
ment in spending and taxing. The
state governors are interested in
having" more regulatory responsi-
bility. As many spending programs

as ’possible should be sent to twp

states.” » .

Opinion

____-j

Any Good

Suggesﬁons?

Reaganomics.

This economic theory is either hailed as a cure-all
for the country’s sagging economy, or despised as, a
government gift to the weathy, depending on the
individual critic’s economic, social and political
background.

Inspired by President Reagan’s belief that govern-
ment should not interfere in the private sector, Rea-
ganomics attempts to decrease federal spending and
regulation, except in the area of national defense.

Whether Reaganomics will really work or not is
often the subject of speculation and debate. Last
week, two speakers with opposing views on the mer-
its of Reaganomics lectured at Pitt. While the con-
tent of their talks varied, one thing remains clear
upon analyzing their opinions—like it or not, there
are no alternatives being offered.

Dr. James Burnham of the Council of Economic
Advisors, said in essence, that it’s too early to judge
the effectiveness of Reaganomics. He said we have to
be cautious of what Reaganomics can and can’t do.
“Given the realities of the world, the slowness of
institutional and economic response, the ability to
manage affairs simply by means of applied econom-
ics is not there,” Burnham said.

He also contended that the reasoning behind Rea-
ganomicrdemands that the government's role in
solving economic problems should be reevaluated.

According to Burnham, this means that the states
should have greater fiscal responsibilities, and that
the government should have only “limited responsi-
bilities” in all areas except defense.

However, Dr. Cyril Wecht, a candidate for U.S.
senator, predicted hard times ahead because of the
president’s economic policies. Wecht told a political
science class that Reaganomics is not working, and
that even some Republican legislators are urging the
president to compromise his plans to cut govern-
ment spending.

Heiadded thatwhile Reaganomics has resultedin
decreased taxes, it has increased interest rates -and
unemployment levels. And, he said, the reasoning
behind Reaganomics, “doesn’t measure up.”

“How can you decrease taxes 25 percent over a
period of a couple years and still increase the mil-
itary budget by a substantial amount?” he asked.

The answer, according to some, is that you proba— '

bly can’t without creating economic havoc. But
what can you do? Wecht said that he would battle

against Reaganomics by speakingout against it and

by coming up with a viable alternative to it.

That’s a sound proposition, but thus far we
haven’t seen any alternatives—not from Wecht,.or
anyone else. Perhaps that’s why we had two speakers
talk about two views of Reaganomics, instead of
having at least one of them discuss the merits of some
kind of alternative economic plan.

Until another economic choice is offered, we’re
left doing what Burnham defines as Reagan’s eco-
nomics philosophy: “Don’t just stand there, ‘undo
something.” A

YONG l.EE N5!» 970406500 M00999?

By BERNARD L. COHEN
A few years ago I didgg series of
case studies of how much our

government is willing (or just-

barely unwilling), to spend to save

'a life in various contexts. .In the

areas of medicine and highway
safety, thousands of lives each year
could besaved at an average cost of
_about$50,000 each. Screening for
cervical or colorectal cancer, pro-
viding improved ambulance ser-
vice for small communities and
installing impact-absorbing guard
rails and skid, resistant surfaces at

dangerous places on highways are.

at-few examples.

Gove.r_nment’s willingness to
pay goes up in other areas such as
pollution control and airline
safety; but when it comes to pro-
tecting‘ the public from radiation,
the cost skyrockets to hundreds of
millions of dollars—or even bil-
lions of dollars—-per life saved.
These numbers are not in dispute;
in fact, some of them are straight
out of government documents. '

Why is the same government

«willing to spend hundreds of mil-

lions of dollars to save a life from
radiation, but yet is not willing to

spend $950,000 dollars to save a life.

from disease or a highway acci-
dent? Clearly this is irrational and
immoral, unnecessarily destroying
thousands of lives and wasting bil-
lions of dollars. Why our govern-
ment acts,in this way would seem
to be a burning question.
Superficially, the answer is sim-
ple. Our government is structured

. to be responsive to public concern,

and an official who fails to recog-
nize this will not remain in govern-

ment employment very long.iIf the

public is more concerned with
radiation hazards’ than with
hazards of highway accidents and
disease, the government spends its
money on the former rather than
on the latter. That is the way a
democratic system functions, and
that is the way it is supposed to
function.

But what determines public con-
cerns? The public largely derives
its education on current issues
from the medizinprincipally televi-
sion. Since TV constantly plays up
stories about radiation dangers, the
public has slowly gotten the
impression that radiation is what it
has to worry about. For example,
every time a little radioactivity
leaks out ofa tank, or a container of
radioactive material falls off a
truck, there is national news cover-
age. There have been approxi-
mately a hundred such accidents
over the past 40 years, but the total
consequences of all of them com-
bined is less than a one percent
chance of a single fatality.

In the recent accident in a
nuclear plant near Rochester,
N.Y., there was never any possible
danger to the public, andno one
got as much radiation exposure

train -it as he gets every day from

.public 15 nofan important consid-

 

 

‘ eration; their priority is to attract

natural sources. However, it was a
lead story on TV news for two days.
All the while, 300 Americans are
killed in accidents every day, but
that gets no coverage. Thousands
of Americans die from disease every
day. but that gets no coverage.
How do the TV producers decide
what to cover? Here again, the
answer is simple—educating the

viewers. For network evening
news, a one-point improvement in
the Nielsen ratings is worth $7 mil-
lion per year in advertising
revenue. In that atmosphere, if a

‘ TV producer were to decide that

educating“ the public is_ more
ivnnertant than attrarting viewers,

how long would he last? Eiduca-. *

 

tional institutions typically have
one Ph.D. professor for every 10
students, but for their 200 million
“students,” there isn’t a single
Ph.D. scientist on any TV network
staff. _ -
’ Clearly, TV is in the entertain-
ment business and educating the
public is not their priority. They
have decided that scaring people
about radiation attracts viewers, so

t ey p ay t at game to the hilt.
Therein lies the answer to our
burning question: why thousands

cl

of.Americans are dying needless ~‘
and billions of dollars are bein, 

wasted. That is one of the prices we

are paying tor our TV entertain-

mam’ (Editor’s note: Bernard
Cohen is a professor in Pitt’s
department of physics.)

Poor Info Contagious

Dear Editor:

Since he construes any opposi-
tion to the Reagan administration
as unpatriotic, Allen Jones wond-
ers in his letter of March 5 what
happened to patriotic spirit
(“Whatever Happened to Patriotic
Spirit”). I wonder what has hap-
pened to the obligation which I
would expect to see in a university
community of knowing what you
are talking about. ‘

First, a representative of the
Young Republicans claims that a
two-party’ system is guaranteed by
the Constitution. The Constitu-

tion says nothing about political‘

parties; the Founding Fathers were
against them.

Next Bruce C. Riley, admitting
he does not know the facts, advan-
ces his opinion (letter of Feb. 24,
“America’s Future Survival
Dependent on Strong Military”)
that a third of the money sup-
posedly going to those in need is in
fact wasted. I’ve never read an
informed estimate nearly as high as
that, and in any case the responsi-
bility of an educated person is to try
to find out the facts, . not -give

unsupported and prejudiced
opinions.

Now Allen Jones attempts to
defend the president’s massive
arms build—up on the grounds that
it creates jobs. Of course it creates
some jobs; but because of the high
technology of military production,‘
comparatively few jobs are created

by that sort of investment. It’s beer‘;

reliably estimated that six times as
many jobs are created by a billion
dollars invested in education as are
created by a billion spent for the
military. But transferring $3 bil-
lion from education to the mil.-
itary, the president is probably
losing the opportunity to create
150,000 jobs—-if he gets away with
it.

The problem is not that Presi-
dent Reagan is seen as a “villain,"
as Mr. Jones says. He has often
shown himself to be poorly
informed, and to have an extra

share of the human failing o are
claiming things to be true becau V 
he wishes they were true. This

seems to be contagious.

Waves Shoot Down Pitt, 99-88

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

The Pitt Panthers strolled into
Pullman, Wash. for their first
round NCAA tournament game
against Pepperdine like a cocky
gunfighter in a new town. They
left with their holsters emptied and
their confidence shot.

 The team doing the shooting

  
 

til.

7nd bloodletting was Pepperdine’

(22-6), a basketball team that
looked as good on the court as it
had on paper. The statistics that
had made The Waves “look like the
No. 1 team in the country,” accord-
ing to Pitt coach Roy Chipman,
were translated into action by Pep-
perdine, who outscored yet another
team,’ 99-88.

It was these offensive scoring
statistics that Chipman had hoped
to tarnish. Pepperdine had shot a
torrid 55 percent from the field dur-
ing the regular season, a somewhat
impressive feat. But there was a
catch. The Waves liked to run, and
many of the baskets came on fast-

..breaks, of which layups are the end
result.

Pepperdine beat San Francisco
twice by scores that went into triple
digits. They had also lost to Evans-
ville and Cincinnati, not overpow-
ering teams,
Chipman. And that gave the Pitt
coach hope.

“I have a feeling that if you put a
hand in their face the basket will
look a lot smaller,” Chipman
conjectured.

Chipman’s reasoning appeared
sound. His team was playing its
best basketball of the season. His

;team had stopped another run-

nd-gun, national ly-ranked team.

” West Virginia. His team played

stingly defense. '

The Pitt Panthers wanted Pep-
perdine to play up to all those
statistics—to come out and shoot

.55 .percent despite full.-court pr€§~

according to ‘

DARRELL GISSENDANNER

sure, to score 100 points on a team
that prided itself on keeping teams
under 70 points.

Pepperdine didn’t shoot 55 per-
cent, and they didn’t score 100
points. The Waves shot 60 percent,
and they scored 99 points. So much
for statistics. _

. ‘‘I knew their guards could play,

but I was impressed with the way
their frontline played,” Chipman
said later. 3

Putting it plainly, they all could
play. Theguards Chipman was ref‘-
qrring to were Boot Bond and Dane
Suttle. The two burned Pitt for 42
points. But even before the game it
was generally conceded that the
two would get their points. After.
all, Bond was averaging 18.4 points
a game while Suttle was pouring in
17.1 points a game.»

What was not conceded was that
Pepperdine would get so many
easy buckets inside, or that they
would get two and three cracks at
the basket or that they would ram-
page through Chipman’s proud 1-
3-l zone as if it were being played
by 98-year-old grandmothers.

Or that they would score 99
points.

If Chipman had anything to lean
back on, it was his defense. After
all, it beat West Virginia. It
brought him to the NCAA’s. And
now, of all times, it would desert
him.

“We didn’t play it with the
intensity we had in the past,”
Chipman lamented. 

Pitt opened the game as usual in
an extended 2-3 zone. Feel them out
first, if they can't handle the 2-3,
then why even bother going to the
1-3-1? Pepperdine put that notion
away quickly with several jumpers
and inside hoops. So far, the statis-
tics weren’t lying.

Pepperdine’s blistering shoot-
ing, and eight-point lead, forced
Pitt to switch to the 1-3-1 zone. It is
a switch that has turned most ball-
a switch that has turned most ball

Gymnasts Shine
But Finish 3rd

By BRIAN BALK

This time consistency was the
winner. Defending champion
Penn State edged out all other
opponents to capture the N.C.A.A.
Eastern Gymnastic Championship
at the Pitt Field House Friday.

Penn State won the close meet
with a score of 143.15, followed by
the University of New Hampshire
with 141.00, and the Pitt Lady
Panthers in third-place with their
season’s best score of 140.65.

“We did the best job we could,
and never gave up. It is just hard to
come in third ‘by only three tenths
of a point,” said Donna Sanft, head
coach of the Lady Panthers. Sanft
gave credit to her squad which
started out unsteady on the balance
beam, then continually built up
their scores in the other three events
to finish with their finest perfor-
mance of the year. Pitt ended the
meet with a team score of 36.30 on
the uneven bars, which was also a
season-high.

In Friday’s team competition,
top-seeded Penn State extended its
string of Eastern Regional titles
with several dynamic performan-
ces. According to Penn State Coach
Marshall Avener, “We were ,in
really good mental and physical
competitive shape. We also threw
the right routines and didn’t go
over our heads.”

Winning the Eastern title was an
especially hard task this year due to
Lady Lions’ lack of depth and their
lengthy road schedule which ended
just last Tuesday.

The only hints about what to
expect in Friday’s team competi-
tion were the teams’ average scores
and resultant seeding order. In

scoring averages and seeding
proved to be accurate. Each team
placed in its respective seeding
order and with approximately the
same average score.

At Friday’s team competition, all
four events were conducted concur-
rently and each team was assigned
its own rotation. Unfortunately for

‘Pitt, with its third seeding, the

Lady Panthers were given one of
the hardest rotations of any team.

After warmups, Pitt had to
endure a 25 minute wait before
challenging one of their weakest
events,’ the balance beam.

After the Lady Panthers’ wait,
their opening performances on the
beam were not very clean. How-
ever, some Lady Panthers, such as ~

tin scored an excellent 9.] in the
event.

The balance beam event was
won by Penn State with a team
score of 36.80. Executing the diffi-
cult, original moves which they are
known for, Penn State clearly dom-
inated this event.

The Lady Panthers’ next event
was the floor exercise. There the
team’s momentum started to grad-
ually pick up. It was All-American
Lisa Shirk who provided the first
bit of hope with a fabulous 9.1rou—
tine. Other fine performances were
given by senior Holly Martino and
Martin, who both scored 8.7.

The Lady Panthers’ spirits were
then uplifted even higher on the
vault. Shirk once again led the way
for the Lady Panthers by sticking a
9.1 Tsukahara vault. Martino, who
is known for her consistency, came
through again asshe posted a fine
score of 8.9. There was a minor
break in Martins first vault, but
she was still able to pull out a score
of 8.45.

The Lady Panthers knew they
had to put every ounce of energy

they had in their last event, the-

uneven bars. Pitt’s first performer
Roxann Evans posted a fantastic
score of 8.85, to start the adrenalin
flowing. Evans’ score was then
duplicated by junior Gretchen
Speich. The Lady Panthers’
momentum did not stop building
there. Martin turned in another
excellent routine to earn an 8.9
score. _

The Lady Panthers fine perfor-
mance was then capped by Shirks
near-perfect 9.7 first-place routine.

When the final all-around scores
were tallied, Shirk for the second
year in a row, took a back seat
(second place) to her prime Eastern
adversary, All-‘America Heidi And-
erson from Penn State.

According to Penn State Coach

Avener, “Heidi is one of the top _
» all-around gymnasts in the country

when she hits.” Her top status was
readily apparent in her dynamic
routines on Friday alone.

The top 10 performers on each
event in Friday’s competition were
invited back for the individual
competition Saturday to determine
the All-East team. Five Lady
Panthers qualified to compete in

Lady Panther Roxanne Evans closed out her career with a
fine performance in her specialty, the uneven bars.

this honorable competition.

The University of New Hamp-
shire captured all three top places
in the vault with its very strong
team. Martino took a respectable
seventh-place with a combined
two-day score of 17.35 to just miss
taking All-East honors.

On the uneven bars, the Lady
Panthers faired much better with
four gymnasts qualifying for indi-
vidual c’ompetition—-Shirk, Evans,
Speich, and Martin. All four hit
their routines -Speich placed
fourth and Martin took a fifth-
place. i

For Shirk, it was a repeat perfor-
mance of the previous night, as she
once again scored a 9.7 with her
difficult butfluent routine. With
her total of 19.40 points she gained
first place and All-East honors. “It

looks very encouraging for Lisa,

g L Seeztlxjphoiq
and possibly Karen and Gretchen
to go to Nationals,” Sanft said.

On the balance beam the Lady

Panthers qualified only one gym- ‘

nast, Martin. With another steady

performance she captured a fifth-
place with a totoal score of 17.9.

The beam was won for the third
consecutive year by Penn State’s
Marcia Levine with her total score
of 18.7.

Shirk was Pitt’s sole competitor
on the floor exercise. Her routine,
filled with expressive dance and
powerful tumbling, was executed
well enough to ‘earn her a fouth
place with a score of 18.25,

Anderson,~who is both Eastern
and National defending champion
on the floor exercise, clearly out-
classed rnost other competitors to
place first with a 18.85 score.

Chipman Needs 2

bcenter Quickly

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

Pitt fans are probably waiting
anxiously . for September. That's
when the Pitt Panther football

‘ team, a sure bet to be number one
111 the pre-season polls, begins its
quest for the national champion-
ship. Then, after football season
comes basketball season.

Next year’s basketball season- fig-
ures to be as eagerly anticipated.

‘The Pitt Panther basketball pro-
gram has come out of . the
doldrums.

For the second consecutive year,
Roy Chipman has taken his basket-
ball team into the NCAA’s. For the
second straight year Pitt has won
20 games. And next year should be
even better. .

Consider that the teams’ top
scorer Clyde Vaughan is but a
sophomore.

Consider that two of the starters,
Andre Williams and George Allen,
are freshmen. Allen figures to be
one-of the starting guards next
year. The six-footer has shown
amazing potential to take it inside,

. -leap over players who are much
%)igger than he is,\and put it in. Ask
Rutgers’ Roy Hinson. The 6-9 cen-

ter went up with Allen, and
watched as the freshman hung in

  

4-3

the air and in a.le—fty scoop shot
in Pitt's 60-47 victory against

Rutgers in the semi-final of the ‘

Eastern 8 tournament.

Williams is exactly the opposite.
While Allen can shake and bake,
Williams’ still growing body con-
tains uptapped resources. The
freshmancan shoot the ball from
15 feet and in, and is a good passer
and rebounder.

The problem is finding a center.

‘ The guards are set. Billy Culbert-
son and Charles Thompson
(whom Chipman has said was
playing the best during the end of
the year) should challenge for start-
ing spots along with Allen. .

Trent Johnson, Boo Kirby,
Vaughan, Chip Watkins, Steve
Beatty and Williams give Chipman
an overabundance of quality for-
wards. He has the bangers in John-
son? and Watkins. He has the
scorers in Vaughan, Williams and
Kirby. Kirby and Vaughan, how-
ever, can do both. Beatty can also
shoot the ‘ball, but had his confi-
dence sapped by his unsuccessful

Mike Rice’s
Firing a
Study in
Double Talk

 

 

By BARRY ZASLOFF

By the powers vested in him, the
Rev. Donald S. Nesti recently
divorced coach Mike Rice from the
Duquesne Duke basketball team.

Though Duquesne Athletic
Director Red Manning and Nesti
officially dropped the axe on Rice
last Wednesday afternoon at a press

' conference high atop the Bluff,
speculation has it that Nesti had
unofficially decided Rice’s fate sev-
eral weeks earlier.

Nesti, president at Duquesne,
and Manning both insisted that

' Rice’s dismissal was not based on
his record or coaching ability—a
wise first move at a conference that
best resembled a chess match. After
all, in four years Rice merely
guided Duquesne to a 62-49 record,
twice captured Eastern 8 Coach of

Radecic,
By JOHNETTE HOWARD

The recent decision not to
send two Pitt women track team‘
members to; AIAW Eastern
Regional Indoor Champion-
ships for which they qualified
earlier this season not only
deprives the two athletes of a
well-earned chance to compete
for honors, but also taints the
credibility of the already-
struggling program.

The two athletes-—freshman
sprinter Renee Henderson and
shot putter Peri Radecic--
along with the five other
members of the team, hav'e"prac-
ticed since ‘Septemberand had
to endure the frequent cancella-
tions of regularly-scheduled
meets and the poor travel and
practice arrangements. most
other Pitt athletes in non-
revenue sports, at one time or
another, experience. /

Radecic, a former All-
America in the discus, has spent
most of her four years at Pitt
without a field events coach.

V After Fitzgerald Field House‘

renovations eliminated the shot
put area, the senior was forced
to practice beneath the stands in
Pitt Stadium often as tempera-

tures dipped into the low-30s.

- A.

    
   
  
 
   
   
 
 
  
 
 
  
 

 

 

Still, Radecic has continued
to compete in the shot, even
with a painful lower back ail-
ment that has bothered her fre-
quently the last two years.

For her efforts, Radecic-—’a
highly-recruited athlete who
had the option of attending
Southern Cal, among other bet-
ter track schools—'was

"rewarded by being asked twice

in her four-year career to forego
the indoor regional competi-
tion in favor of the outdoor
championships later in the
year. Both times, despite quali-
fying, she has not been able to
participate in the indoor meet.

A Pitt athletic department
official said financial consider-
ations kept Radecic and Hend-
erson in Pittsburgh while, the
regionals were held at the Uni-
versity of Maine. The cost of the
trip—reported to be around
$1,000—was considered too
high, especially for the track
program’s meager budget-
money that‘ first-year coach
Elbert Kennedy would presum-
ably prefer to put towards

 

Viewvint

recruiting for future seasons.

The same Pitt official said the
decision not to go to the region-
als was madejointly by Hender-
son, Radecic and Kennedy-a
"gracious" if merely symbolic

move to include the two ath-

letes, considering they were
being so politely grounded.

In track, the season is spent
working toward qualifying for
the regional championships,
with the ultimateaim of quali-
fying for .the national
championships.

To impose any limits besides
their own athletic ability on
athletes who work toward qual-
ifying for championship meets
is improper and, taken further,
a reneging on one of the most

basic things a,university offers

its athletes—-a forum in which
to compete.

*College athletics has long
been founded on this supposi-

. tion and the resultant exchange

of “services”—-the athlete per-
forms for the university, while
the university‘ provides its ath-
letes with the chance to compete
and, sometimes, a free
education.

,Sadly, it seems, Pitt qualifies
for little more than criticism in
this case.

point, to pass. To pass to Boot
Bond, whose spot 25 feet from the
basket might have to be retired.
The senior guard so rarely missed,
especially in the second half, to end
with 24 points.

While Pepperdine was shred-
ding the 1-3-1 zone with good,
open shots, Pitt was forcing shots,
hitting few and falling behind fast.

if it hadn't been for Gissen-

. _,,,_danner’s 20 points and several
steals, Pitt might have been pack-
ing it up to go back East by half-
time instead of being down by only
seven at 45-38.

Still, with Clyde Vaughan in
foul trouble, with Dwayne Wallace
having an off night, against a team
that relished high scoring games,
things didn’t look good for Pitt.

They looked even worse, when
the Waves quickly turned the half-
time lead into an 11-point bulge.
But slowly Pitt began to battle
back. Vaughan got hot, Gissen-
danner stayed hot and freshman
Chip Watkins came off the bench
to pour in 11 points. The lead was

, ~ ut to two at 67-65 when Gissen—

I point play.

Pepperdine, however, applied Panther guard Dwayne Wallace, one of the stars in Pitt’s Eastern 8 tournament win,
the tout? de grace as Bond hit three had a cold shooting night against Pepperdine. Roth photo

straight jumpers from the corner
and forward Orlando Phillips used
his derriere to position himself for
two easy follow ups. By then, it was
over.

“They shot 60 percent, and they
were better tonight. They don’t
shoot that well, and we might be
better some other night,” Chipman
said after the game.

The only problem is that the
Pepperdine Waves have been
shooting that well all year.

try at center. Forward is where he
belongs.
And now the center. Get one, and

country, any time. Fail to- get one,
and Pitt is just a good team capable
of pulling off some upsets, but
hard pressed to stay consistently
with the Georgetowns, St. johns,
and Boston Colleges.

Surely, a Pat Ewing type would
be ni(:e, but forget it. All Pitt needs
is a 6-11 guy who can garbage in
about eight to ten points a game,
and muscle other teams’ big men.
That type could free the outside for
 : Vaughan and Kirby, or Williams.
s:::5=5- ‘.  ' Vaughan would no longer have to

 post up bigger men inside, and he
could also crash the offensive
boards from the outside, making
him tougher to box out.

It will be interesting to see Pitt’s
recruiting the next couple of
weeks. It is obvious that Chipman
and his staff go after the big boys.
Last year, Pitt was in the running
for Villanova’s Ed Pickney, and

‘ Georgetown’s Bill Martin. Now.

To Become Great

the Panthers are hot on the trail of
perhaps the best player in Ken-
tucky, a 6-5 guard, whose descrip-
tion is simplv exciting. To put it
simply, he’s a “Darrell . Griffith
type.”

Then of course there is Lloyd
Moore. l*"Ickle Lloyd Moore. Moore

has the Pitt coaches baffled. Ask.«.(-

them where Moore is going and
they don't have the slightest. It is
entirely possible that Moore
doesn’t have the slightest either. If
you were to bet, however, Mar-
quette would be a good choice.
Mike Rice’s recent firing is a defi-
nite negative on the attractability
of Duquesne. Why would Moore
want to go to a program that has
few bright spots? A program that is
mired in confusion? A program
that fired a coach that had "had a
winning record, and recruited
nationally acclaimed players?
Marquette appears to be the team ‘

for Moore. For some reason or

another he has eliminated Pitt,;“;‘gk
from competition. It happens. Bu?“ '

what Roy Chipman cannot let
happen is a failure to get a center
for next year. It would be a sin.

teams to the National Invitational
"Tournament. V
Not bad for a coach who had one
of, if not the smallestbudgets in the
Eastern 8, and who had a practice
gym that makes your local YMCA
basketball court look about as
‘extravagant as Madison Square

Clearly, Rice displayed the kind
of dedication necessary to develop a
big-time basketball program,
which university officials claim
they want. Just over a year ago,
immediately after Pitt had defeated

Duquesne to .win the Eastern 8

tournament, Rice mysterious\ly
collapsed to the Civic Arena floor,
showing no visible signs of life.
Rice regained consciousness 10
minutes later and discussed reasons
behind the blackout. He ate little
and slept even less as the league
tournament moved close to a fin-
ish. Rice's only concern was watch-

‘Jog films of Pitt, searching forjust

one little weakness that ,would

~ benefit the Dukes. Talk about a

person giving his all to a cause-
Mike Rice bled for4DuquesrIe.

’ So'why the firing? A warning:

double talk comes cheap. A

‘‘-It’s a matter of compatibility,”

Nesti said evasively. “I’m not sure

the necessary mix was there".

“It was a decision made after tho-
rough evaluation and a policy deci-
sion adopted by the board of
directors,”. Manning said. “It is the
university's feeling thatsome of
our long-range goals can best be
accomplished by hiring a new
coach who fully understands and
agrees with the president's concept
of the role of intercollegiate

athletics—in particular a quality
basketball program—-have within
the mission of the university."

1 Ah, finally some
Exactly what is the mission of the
university? Education first, then
graduation. Enter Doug Arnold
and Ricky Tunstall, two of Rice's
prized recruits. Both left Duquesne
with grade problems,‘ failing to
accomplish the mission.

' “That’s part of the problem,”
Nesti said. “There was a_difference
inphilosophy that revolves around
the delicatebalance between aca-
demics and education. It is a high,
high priority that all of our stu-
dents graduate.”

The conflict surfaces. It was
Nesti and his hardline view of edu-
cation versus Rice and his strong
desire to build a big-time basket-
ball program. Nesti says they can
coexist. Rice agreed with the theory
but disagreed with the method.

“I’m much more realistic about
what it takes to field a first-class
basketball team,” Rice recently
said on a local sports talk show. “If
they want to compete they have to
recruit a kid like Ricky Tunstall
and work hard to keep him in
school. I

/ “If the best player in Western»

Pennsylvania is a C student, and all
the other local schools are recruit-
ing him, then we have to be
afforded the same opportunity,"
Rice continued. “That's where I
think they have to understand
where they want to compete."

A salient point. The number of
quality recruits that a struggling
basketball program can sign is
minimal. ~The availability of

substance. H

with an A or B grade point average
is even more rare. How a school can
upgrade a dwindling basketball
program, as Duquesne says it
wants to, by refusing C students
who play A basketball? It is beyond
explanation.

And just what is the crime in
accepting C students? Does a little
pen mark on a sheet of paper mean
that much? Assuredly, Father,
Nesti, there are many C students
who have more intelligence and
common sense than do A or B stu-
dents. Does the fact that some cati-
not score an A or B on an exam, as
many non-athletes also fail to do,
mean "that Duquesne cannot pro-

vide them with a rewarding four '

years of education?
Good Father, are you saying that
there is no hope for these student

athletes? Shame if you are. Why

turn away great athletes who are
“only” average students before giv-
ing them a chance.

Why not give the C student an
opportunity to help himself by
gaining an education, and to help

the university by strengthening a .

basketball program. Sure, some
will never graduate, but those cases
will serve to taint university pride
only slightly..Some C studentswill
graduate, never make it'to profes-
sional sports, but use the education
to find a good job, which will
reflect highly on the university.
One thing is certain: if
Duquesne wants to remain com-
petitive, Father Nesti has to accept

‘ C students, pump more money into

the program, and perhaps most
importantly, he must allow the

new coach more of a chance than

he gave to Mike Rice.

Geary Named All-America  

All-America honors is some-
thing I always dreamed about
and always wanted.”

But, whereas Geary- is now
motivated by his recent success
and promise of more yet to
come, his return to the Pitt track
team, he says, was first prompt-
ed by fear.

“I didn't want to look back
five years from now and wonder
where I might have been,"
Geary said earlier this year. “I
was scared when I thought of
what I gave up.”

That he had the chance to
regain it is something Geary
says he is “very thankful” for,
even if the notion of ranking-
among the best half-milers in
America and a good portion of
the rest of the world is an idea he
still finds mindboggling. I

“I guess I have to be consider-
ed among the top half-milers in
the country now--I guess All- '
America Honors means you can
call yourself that,” Geary said,
“but it is still hard to believe.
Someone came up to me after
brunch this morning and said‘,
‘All-America Darren Geary’. It
struck me as funny. It’s some-
_tFting I still have to get used to.”

If he has his wish, Geary
would like to make the two
words a preface ‘to his name in .
his remaining year and a half at
Pitt. 1

“I’m extremely happy, but
I'm not really content that I got
sixth place in the nati_on—I
wish I could have run the race
in the finals that I ran in the
trials,” Geary said. “It makes
melook forward more to out-
door season. It’s going to be
harder outdoors (to win All-
America honors), but that’s part
of the challenge.”

Granted—but once had, the
same challenge twice is often
twice as easy. ‘
