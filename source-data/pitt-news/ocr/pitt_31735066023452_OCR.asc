.Student/ Faculty

Committee Opposes

Drafting Of 1 9- And 20-Year Olds

By MARGI STUMPF

_ Pitt News Staff Writer _
Unlike some draft resistance

groups” whose sentiment is levied
against conscription under any cir-
cumstances, an ad hoc committee
of Pitt students and faculty
members have narrowed their con-
cern to the kind of registration pro-
posed by President Carter, one in-
itially limited to 19 and 20-year-
-olds. '

Though an anti-draft ideology is
the basic philosophy of the Pitt
Adhoc Committee Against the
Draft (PACAD), its members are
particularly opposed to registration
of persons in their late teens
because that age group is generally
uninformed about politics, accor-
ding to PACAD spokesman and
professor of history, Joseph White.

Appropriately, PACAD is spon-
soring a “teach-in” Thursday in the
Student Union lower lounge from
noon to 2:30 p.m. Titled “The
Draft and the Threat of War,” the

' teach-"in will include speeches from

educators, human rights activists

« and Vietnam draft resistors, on

topics PACAD members believe

_ should_be known to the public. _: _  l

 

Some of the speakers and topics
are: Molly Rush of the Mobilization
for Survival group, who will speak
on “The Costs of the Renewed
Arms Race”; William Chase of
Pitt’s history department who will
address the question of whether the
Soviet Union has an objective in-
terest in forcing a conﬂict in the
Persian Gulf; Thomas Kerr of
Carnegie-Mellon University and
state president of the American
Civil Liberties Union, and the Rev.
Elizabeth Scott, member of the
Universities and City Ministries
who recently returned from Iran.

“(PACAD) is broad-based in the
sense that we don’t have a three
page, single-spaced, typewritten
paper of our manifesto of the
world,” White said about the ad
hoc committee. “We relate to
anyone who thinks that a respon-
sibility of foreign policy is to not fo-
ment (international) crisis and pour
hot oil on them.”

Both White and PADAC
member David Silberman said they
view Carter’s singling-out of 19 and

, 20-year-olds as an attempt to avoid
__ maximum conﬂict over a possible
_draf,_t_b_y_ leaving out the age group

that would most vehemently protest
a draft, persons roughly 25 years-of
age or older who would remember
vividly the Vietnam War.
“(Carter’s proposal) takes the
steam out of any nationwide move-
ment against the draf ,” Silberman
said, adding that in his opinion,

“nineteen and 20-year-olds don’t —

have a true feeling of what _our vital
interests really are . . . . ..the interests
of oil companies.”

It is easy to whip up a sense of
nationalism among young adults
who aren’t familiar with the issues
at stake, he further explained.

White said he believed the Carter
administration has “no special in-
terest in strengthening the forces of
peace and stability in the world”
and that recent foreign policy has
been marked by a “subservience of
detente and arms limitation
. . . . . . and makes the possibility of a
war more likely rather than less like-
ly.” v
Tomorrow’s teach-in, which
PACAD claims in a press release is
in a style “originated at Pitt in 1965

in response to the Vietnam War,”
-will include a qluestionf and answer

session foﬂowirig presentations.

Registration For Draft    pi,

By MARY KANE

By The Associated Press
A resolution supporting Presi-

cent said they were supportive, 20

l percent were opposed, nine percent

were undecided and three percent
had no opinion. Forty percent sup-
ported Carter’s plan to register men
and women 19 and 20 years of age,
47 percent were opposed, 10 percent
are undecided and three percent
had no opinion.

The survey was given to a
representative sampling of Pitt
students,_ according to Blazer. He
said that prior to the survey, SGB
held a draft forum and found
students’ opinions were too split to
make a stand at that time.

Board member Martin Bertocchi
said, “Why is it now OK to take a
stand that represents only half the
students when it wasn’t OK
before?” Blazer said there was
“substantial evidence to make such
a decision.” ‘

The resolution passed 5-1, with
Bertocchi abstaining.

SGB PESIDENT BILL ABRAHAM ‘

 

Board member Scott Hendler, ’

who voted against the resolution,

said, after the meeting that the

Studies students, who pay _,a»,,._,_'i"l"

However, SGB President _'Bill: I
Abraham noted that the board’s'.' ,1 9,
new bylaws, now being drawn up by." .

SGB , will clearly define
undergraduates as not belonging to

the College of General Studies.
Abraham said the SGBs bylaws

would supersede those of the Legal"

The board did not originally ap-

prove the committee’s new officers,» '
either. Mary Curiale, who was re--

elected chairman, plans to register
in the College of General Studies in
the fall andwould therefore be in-
eligible to serve on the committee.

However, Abraham said Curiale is i
currently enrolled, in CAS. ' The '

according to Abraham. -

Pitt News Staff Writer
Many apprehensive students and
professors never file complaints
with the Academic Integrity Review
Board because they are under the
impression that their problem will
be “swept under the rug.” Irwin J.
Schulman, Dean of the College of
Arts and Sciences, explains the
absence of complaints is due to
“the machinery (the method of fil-
ing complaints) being complicated
and the students and professors are
not willing to go through it.”
Students and faculty members
can file complaints with the
Academic Integrity Review Board
for several reason, the most com-
mon reason being a discrepancy
over a grade. Some professors also
file complaints against students
suspected of cheating on a test or
plagiarizing a term paper. The
most difficult problem to ressolve is
one in which a professor suspects a
student of cheating. Usually, it is
circumstantial evidence and it is
very hard to prove.

wécinié§diii‘.:Mm"' ’ nii'12;i9s3""' S’

Complexiﬂes Reduce Number Of Integrity Charges

Schulman prefers having the stu-
dent and the professor meet to ver-
bally resolve the problem, a method
that is usually effective.

In cases where this method does
not remedy the situation, the
department chairman is contacted.
The department head then decides
whether or not the complaints are
subject to consideration under the
terms of the Academic Integrity
Guidelines. When either a student
or a professor decide to carry the
case further, Schulman’s assistant,
Reid Reading is appointed to be the
mediator.

If the assistant dean is unsuc-
cessful in settling the argument, he
will turn the case over to Schulman.
A committee consisting-of one stu-
dent and a faculty member are then
appointed to investigate the case.
This preliminary hearing will allow
committee members, and others in-
volved, to discuss _the charges.
Within five days, the student ‘or
professor will receive the views of
the committee. At that point, they
have the option to either accept or

reject those views. Schulman said
that many of the cases never reach
this point,.because there is usually a
simpler way to settle the problem.

When all else fails, a student or
member of the faculty may request
a formal hearing. There are four
faculty members elected each year
for two terms and three students
who are also elected every year, but
serve only one year. The fourth
faculty member is the chairman of
the formal hearing. This creates an
equal distribution between student
and professor, achieving an unbias-
ed committee. The final outcome
of the formal hearing is decided
upon by. Schulman.

Schulman said he has almost
always seen professor-student pro-
blems settled during one-to-one
confrontations. He added that he
has never seen a case come to a for-
mal hearing.

“I aminterested in teaching and‘

finding out about injustice,”
Schulman said, encouraging
students and professors who are
dissatisfied to seek outside help.

CAS Council's Queries On Self-Designed Majors Answered

By TERESA SOKOL

Pitt News Staff Writer
Discussion concerning the nature

A and quality of changes needed for

the self-designed major. program
was on the agenda of Monday’s
meeting of the College of Arts and
Sciences (CAS) Council.

Susanna Downie, advisor for the
self-designed major program, at-
tended the Council meeting to
answer questions about the pro-
gram and to discuss the feasibility
of changes suggested by Dean Irwin

Schulman at the last CAS Council
meeting.

Downie divided the students in-
terested in the self-designed major
program into two categories—those
whose interest is “quasi-depart-
mental” and those whose interest
cannot be satisfied by a particular
department, at least in a liberal arts
college such as Pitt.

Downie called the latter group of
students “pre-disciplinary,” mean-
ing that these students plan a voca-

' tion by making “valuable use of the

curriculum without depth of
departmental study.”

Faculty often give vocationally
oriented study a negative response,
Downie added.

‘Much of the conflict about the ‘I

nature of some self-designed ‘ma-
jors, said Schulman, comes.from1
this “tension between utility and
knowledge.” .
Downie said that improvements
are being considered for the self-
designed major program. a The
number of credits may be raised

from 36 to 45, with the inclusion of
five or six advanced or 100-level
courses in avprogram, according to
Downie.

At Council’s last meeting,
Schulman had pointed out that Eiié
lack of advanced level courses in
many self-designed majors might
demonstrate insufficient “growth
of knowledge” on the student’s
part. ‘

A minimum quality-point
average to enter the self-designed

major program might help to‘

eliminate marginal students who

might attempt to use the program to
slide by, according to Downie. It
would also place more value on the
program for those opting for it,
Downie added.

However, few students entering
the program are “marginal,” ac-
cording to Downie, and she sug-
gested that an honors element-be
added to the program to recognize
the high achievement of many
students.

By TERESA SOKOL

Pitt News Staff Writer
There is more than one team in
Pittsburgh that can use the adjec-
tive “steel,” and they are the Pitts-
burgh Steel Wheelers, an organiza-
tion of handicapped and non-
handicapped individuals interested

in wheel chair basketball.

In fact, it is a game of wheel chair
basketball against the sophomore
service honorary, Lambda Sigma,
that brings the basketball team to
the Fitzgerald Field House on
Thursday, March 13 at 7:00 p.m.

The members of Lambda Sigma,

and any other student interested in
giving wheelchair basketball a shot,
are going to challenge the Steel
Wheelers to a game.

Donations to the game are $.50
and all proceeds will go tolthe Steel
Wheelers and to disabled Pitt
students. Tickets to the game will
also be used as raffle tickets, accor-
ding to Mary Lou Galantino, presi-
dent of Lambda Sigma.

The Steel Wheelers organization
was started in 1977 by John Sikora,
an ex-basketball player, paralyzed

in an automobile accident, and Bill '

Shay,. the head basketball coach at
Allegheny Community College.

Hand in Hand, which is coming up
on March 29, works with the School
for the Blind in Oakland, and has
“adopted” grandparents at the Ivy
Nursing Home. According to

Student Government Board
president, Bill Abraham, an-
nounced SGB’s considerations
on teacher evaluations, the draft
and the Black Studies depart-
ment, at this month’s meeting of
the Senate Council.

SGB has voted not to print
undergraduate academic reviews
which contain teacher evalua-
tions, said Abraham.

“A teacher signs a release
form only if they want their
evalutation to be printed,” said
Abraham. ‘ “Teachers who
receive bad evaluations can
refuse to sign the release.”

The result is a review com-
piled of good evaluations, added
Abraham. '

Evaluations are independent
of the printing and they will still
be conducted, but the cost of the
printing is about $5000 and, as
Abraham noted, “It was felt
that the money could be used
elsewhere. ’ ’

Tallies from a recent student

survey on the “revitalization of »

the draft” were announced by

 

Abraham. ‘ He said the polls
showed 53 percent in favor of
the draft, 33 percent against and
14 percent undecided. Abraham
added that “62 percent would
like to bar women from
combat.”

The SGB additionally passed -
a resolution to support the Black
Studies department in its efforts
to maintain the integrity of the
department.

_In other business, Chancellor
Wesley Posvar reported that he
was pleased that the unviersity’s
annual fundshave increased by
20 percent and he commented
that fall term admissions report
is favorable. Posvar was con-
cerned that Governor Thorn-
burg’s six percent budget in-
crease does not include an in-
crease for medical education.

“The appropriation is much
too low for the dental and phar-
macy schools,” said Posvar.
“It is a matter of major concern "
to_ the University.”

Reports were also presented
by the Senate Athletic Commit-
tee, the Educational Policies

‘Committee and the Faculty

Health and Welfare Committee.

da Slgma team, shows off some of his court techniques.

Earthquake Rocks '

Philadelphia Suburbs

By The Associated Press

PHILADELPHIA Sleeping
residents of the city’s northern sec-
tion and suburbs were jarred awake
as the fourth apparent earthquake
in less than two weeks struck the
area Tuesday, officials said.

No injuries or damages were
reported in any of the movements,
the largest of_ which came about 1
a.m. I

“It’s sort of a little swarm or a
series of earthquakes,” said Waver-
ly Person, a spokesman for the Na-
tional Earthquake Information Ser-
vice in Golden, Colo.

“They have all been very minor.
We have this kind of thing in many
areas. There possibly is a fault line
there but we just can’t say because
everything is‘ so preliminary at this
time.” A

He said all the tremors were in an .

area about 20 miles north of
downtown Philadelphia.

Police said they had hundreds of
reports and queries concerning
Tuesday’s tremors from residents in
Montgomery and Bucks counties.

‘ ‘It sounded like a boom and then
everything started to shake,” said a
trooper at the,Trevose barracks in
Bucks County. -

Tuesday’s earthquake was
measured at about 3.2 on the
Richter scale. On March 5, one
measured at 3.0 or less was record-
ed at 12:07 p.m. and about 13
minutes later one was detected but
was too slight to measure at the

world?

center’s Green Pond, N.J., tracking
station, he said. V
On March 1 an immeasurably

.small earthquake was detected, he

said. The occurrence had been
thought at first to have been a
foreshock to the first March 5
tremors but now seems to have been
a separate earthquake, he said.

And the movements might con-
tinue, he added.

“You might be seeing very, very
small ones after this, though I can’t
say that you will,” Person said.

The Richter scale is a measure of
ground motion as recorded on
seismographs. Every increase of
one number means a tenfold in-
crease in magnitude. Thus a
reading of 7.5 reflects an earth-
quake 10 times stronger than one of
6.5.

A reading of 3.5 can cause slight
property damage.

cleaning up his home in the city’s

when the tremors Tuesday gave him

By The Associated Press

HARRISBURG—In a bid to
break into the big leagues of tourist
promotion, Pennsylvania has an-
nounced a $750,000 campaign to at-
tract visitors to the state.

The six-week campaign will start
April 21 and appear on television
and radio and in newspapers and
magazines in Pennsylvania and
cities up to 300 miles away, com-
merce Secretary James Bodine told
the House Appropriations Commit-
tee on Monday.

In making his budget presenta-
tion for the coming fiscal year,
Bodine asked that next year the
department be given $2.25 billion
for travel promotion. The $750,000
for the new campaign will take this
year’s entire budget.

“This fiscal year marks the first
time we have been in the major
leagues with a real state advertising
budget,” Bodine said.

Although it ranks fifth behind
California, Texas, Florida and New
York in tourism, Pennsylvania

spends far less to promote its"

$5-billion-a-year industry, Bodine
said.

New York budgets $10 million a
year for tourist promotion, while
Virginia spends $3 million a year
and New Jersey $1.5 million.

“If we are to maintain our

momentum, advertise ourselves and
challenge our competition, we must
move forward in this area,” Bodine
said.

Most of the new campaign—90
percent—will be advertised on

television while 5 percent will be on .

radio and 5 percent in print media,
said Skip Becker, director of travel
development for the state.

Rep. Marvin Miller, R-Lancaster,
said he is concerned the department
may be off target.

Instead of a statewide campaign,
the department should boost certain
areas, particularly the southeast, he
said.

“We have a substantial tourist in-
dustry and the last season was
nothing short of a near disaster,”
he said in an interview.

He said the accident at Three
Mile Island, a polio scare among
the Amish and the gas shortage
combined to keep tourists away.

Although he couldn't getdetails
from Bodine, Miller said it appears
Pennsylvania will try to emulate the
successful “I Love New York cam-
paign,” but without . enough
money. ’

He said the last time the depart-—

ment tried to spread tourist promo-
tion dollars statewide,. for the
Bicentennial, the campaign ﬂop-
ped. «

Draft Resolution
Passed By SGB‘  A

(Continuedjrompage 1)

Bertocchi, SGB liason to the
Pennsylvania State Association of
State-Related Universities
(PSASRU), said the association will
be’ holding press conferences in
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh to res-
pond to Gov. Dick Thornburgh’s
budget. .

Bertocchi added that PSASRU
worked for the Truth In Testing Bill
recently passed by the state
legislature. According to Bertoc-
chi, the bill requires that students
who take Scholastic Aptitude Tests
and similar exams be given a copy
of the test answers and their score
upon request. Bertocchi said this
'bill would guard against possible
mistakes and would make the
testing system more fair and ac-
curate. “

Food Service liason .Blazer
reported that there will be a 10.5

percent increase in housing for next
year and a l2.2‘percent board in-
crease. Blazer said the increase will
be explained in a letter being sent to
all students. I

V Abraham said SGB received a let-
ter from the Black Action Society

musical, comedy, drama or dancing talents. Also
members of the university community may attend
events like last Saturday’s Greek Sing or the chariot
race.

Greek Week, and its counterparts sponsored by
other groups, provides a welcomed change to Pitt
students, burdened by their course work and other
problems inherent to the typical college student. It is
these traditional events that relieves some of the per-
sonal tension experienced by students.

All students, regardless of whether they are af-
filiated with the sponsoring organizations, should
play an active role, either through attendance or par-
ticipation, in the events involved during these special
weeks. Not only will student involvement provide
some pleasure amid chaos for the individual, it will
also strenghten Pitt’s tradition of sponsoring the

special weeks by showing that students really care.

West Bank——Building Block or Stumbling Block for U.S.

By JOSEPH C. HEIM

With the recent United States
vote against Israel’s settlement
policies on the West Bank, a new
wave of controversy has again ap-
peared in the nation’s media. The
effect of this action has already
made ' its
political events, as many of the can-
didates are attempting to assuage
the strong and key pro-Israel
voters. Though the West Bank

impact onwdomestic '

“problem” is highly visible, it re-
mains an element of ignorance to
most of the American public.

The West Bank is likely to be of
increasing importance in the times
to come, for it is at the nexus of the
current dilemma of United States
policy in regard to the Arab-Israeli
conflict. -..1portantly, the West
Bank issue can either be a building
block or a stumbling block -of
future U.S. policy, though it should
not-be the only black, as it now

seems. .

The Camp David accords require
a settlement by the parties involved
on the A issue of Palestinian
autonomy and the West Bank to be

reached by May 1st. This is not’

likely to be done unless there is a
new approach. Following the initial
breakthrough of the Camp David

accords, the United States withdrew.

from its direct role in being the
Camp David process broker.
Negotiations then took a more

bilateral course, with the U.S. tak-
ing more of a background role as
negotiations took place directly be-
tween Israel and Egypt. However,
very different conceptions have
become a barrier to further pro-
gress. This barrier can only be
overcome with a new direct U.S. in-
itiative in the Camp David process.
Unfortunately, this is not likely,
especially in an election year. There
are very real political costs for the
United States to undertake an in-

itiative. President Carter is aware
of these constraints, as. his recent
reactions have shown. The next
area of the Camp David negotia-
tions, the West Bank and the ques-
tion of Palestinian autonomy, are
likely to be a great deal more dif-
ficult in substantive areas and the
risk of failure is very easily
translated into political loss. Thus,
the United States is unlikely to take
the initiative needed to get the talks

U.S. Withdrawal from OIympics——Fear of Comparison

By STEPHEN WOHL

Fear of unfavorable comparison

— with the Soviet Union is the real

reason the United States govern-
ment is pushing for a boycott of the
Moscow Olympics.
The pretext offered to justify a
boycott would fall apart if any
reporter allowed into the presence
of Jimmy Carter would have the
guts to ask Carter to swear that the
U.S. was not organizing forays into
Afghanistan from Pakistan prior to
1980, and if Carter would be asked
to swear that the CIA had never had
liason with Afghanistan only three
months earlier, and was then in turn
killed by his own people. Amin
never issued a plea for world help
against a Soviet “invasion” because
he was already out of power before
'that_)“invasion” took place. Soviet
troops were calledinto Afghanistan

 

by the government of Afghanistan
under terms of the Afghan-Soviet
treaty of Dcember 5, 1978, ‘and
helped Afghanistan resist the
mounting pressure from
U.S.-equipped raiding forces which
have been dispatched out of die-
tator Zia’s Pakistan for the past
two years (the U.S. also makes itself
an enemy of Pakistan’s people by
arming and propping up Zia, the
brute who traitorously overthrew,
jailed, and eventually murdered the
Pakistani’s democratically elected
and loved president, Ali Bhutto). In
any case, the U.S. certainly can

. have no objection to one country

sending military assistance to
another, having imposed 540,000
U.S. troops on Vietnam, having
changed puppet governments in
Saigon more than a dozen times
during the U.S.’s long Vietnam oc-
cupation and having napalmed dai-

 
 

ly the resisting population as
witnessed on our television screens.
Jimmy Carter sees nothing wrong
with manintaing 50,000 U.S. troops
in South Korea to this day. His
protestations reek with hypocrisy.
In Korea, Guatemala, the Congo,
Vietnam, the Dominican Republic,
and Cambodia, massive physical
battle by the local citizenry against
the entering U.S. soldiers was hor-
ribly plain to see; but all the many
reporters in Afghanistan, including
numerous Americanlcamera crews
at the turn of the year, have not
been able to even catch glimpse of
such battle against Soviet soldiers
because there is no such battle, or-
dinary Afghanistanis evidently be-
ing pleased by the riddance of
Amin, by the opening of the
prisons, by the return to programs
redistributing property and wealth,
and by the new security against

Pakistan-based marauders.

As to the real motives for the
boycott effort: the American
Olympic athletes as a team would
again lose, and probably would not
even take second place. But much
more important, U.S. leaders fear
what will follow if they allow great
numbers of Americans—particular-
ly young Americans—to see, with
their own eyes, an alternative social
system that by contrast is working.
Personal witness of the constantly
rising standard of living of the
Soviet Union is dangerous to the
U.S. power structure at a time when
the American standard of living is
collapsed to a level lower than in
1968, and is dangerous to that
power structure when the American
people are getting poorer each and
every year (poorer because almost
no one’s paper-dollar income is in-
creasing as fast as prices).

How would U.S. leaders explain
to shocked Olympic tourists and
participants the high-rise apartment
buildings. popping up like
mushrooms all around Moscow and
the movement of 11 million Rus-
sians into brand new homes in 1979,
while U.S. housing starts fell from 2
million in 1978 to 1.4 million in
1979? How would they explain why
rent in the USSR, including all
utilities, costs no-one more than 5
percent of monthly inocme; why a
ride on the giant and expanding
Moscow subway costs the same 5
kopecs as in 1935; why a loaf of
bread costs the same 10 kopecs as in
1948; why medical care, dental

‘care, and university education are

Development of Foreign Policy in Mid-East Important Step

(Continuedfrom Page 6)
back on center, at least until after
the elections.

Unfortunately, time is not with
us. Amos Perlmutter, in the sum-
mer ’79 issue of “Foreign Affairs,”
called the hope of success a “Race
Against Time.” Perlmutter also
raises the issues that must be ad-
dressed in the next stage of the
Camp David negotations:

The first issue that must be ad-
dressed is who is to control the
Synonymous, is the
question of who is to compose the
population. The second issue flows
from the first, that being what is to
be the territory of the West Bank

and those areas which are to be
autonomous. The third area is con-
cerned with who will be responsible
for security, and what regime will
determine that security.

Finding a common ground
through these three areas is not like-
ly to be an easy path to tread. Very
real fundamental differences, often
value based, must be dealt with.

Though these issues are at the
heart of the “problem,” the most
immediate area of difficulty may
only partly concern the above three
issues.

The first area of difficulty is like-

' ly to occur in debate over the form

of “transition.” Here again, there

are likely to be major obstacles. The
difference is not likely to be solved
bilaterally by Israel and Egypt
alone. Perceived minor-changes,
upon closer examination, are likely
to have profound consequences
that may prove unacceptable to cer-
tain parties. For example, origin-
ally ‘in. the autonomy plan, there
was to be an abolition of the Israeli
military government in the West
Bank. This was later changed to a
“withdrawal, not abolition” of the
West Bank military government.
There are hard choices to be
made on the road ahead. The
United States will again be forced to
undertake an initiative in the Camp

ment with full economic security
and dignity is at age 60 for men and
55 for women, while Americans can
no longer afford to retire even at
age 70; why paid yearly vacations
for Soviet workers are lengthier
than those for American workers;
why Aeroflot is the largest airline in
the world, with the lowest passenger
fares in the world; why the USSR
consumer price index decreases
from year to year while wages-alone
go ‘up; why Soviet youth are
healthier and involve themselves
more in sports than their American
counterparts; why fewer Russians
than Americans are forcibly confin-
ed in prisons and mental institu-
tions; why Soviet steel and oil and
wheat production already surpasses
that of the U.S.; why zero
unemployment and a labor shortage
allow every Soviet worker to select
from among many always-available
jobs; and why slums in the USSR
would have to be looked for witha
magnifying glass!

A disproportionately large
percentage of U.S. Olympic com-
petitors are black and poor; when
they return from Moscow to
American reality, to the decay,
poverty, and hopelessness of
American cities, how are you going
to keep them from talking to the
neighbors and the press? If the en-
tire portrait of the Soviet Union
proves to be a lie, how are you go-
ing to keep most Americans, who
learn of a differnt Russia, from
wondering what other fairy tales
their heads have been filled with?
Having become aware of alternative
economic possibilities, how are you
going to convince them to contain
their rage as the new depression
deepens and as oil companies, war
companies, and other high thieves
grab ever-increasing super-profits
and attach strings to ever-increasing
numbers of politicians?

Far safer to keep the kids and the

"9 o~ o~

._Ov

tourists home, ev_en if you have to
threaten to revoke their passports if
they dare try to go see Russia for
themselves! Far safer to protect and
preserve intact~the cartoon image of
the Soviet Union so carefully
disseminated by the American in-
formation media—-the media totally
owned by and totally controlled by
comfortable capitalists. Capitalist
economies are going through a
much-needed gear-up for war; the
last thing capitalists now want is
Olympic-scale direct meeting and
communication between American
human beings ‘and Russian human
beings, demystifying “The Enemy”

(the looming and inhuman and?

ominous image of The Enemy
thrives on ignorance; the mass get-
together at Moscow will dispel ig-
norance, altering the image of
Russia and Russians in the minds of
many Americans, turning many
away from preconceived animosity;
hence war psychology will become
difficult, to propagate, war taxes
will become difficult to collect, and
war-industry proﬁts will become
difficult to justify—especially in
hard times). _

Moves by the U.S. to sabotage
the Twenty-Second Olympiad and
to limit Soviet-American contact
got diligently under way in
l974—the year Moscow was award-
ed the games over U.S. objec-
tion—and these moves haves since

become more and more blatent.
Doing its part, Pan Am, the U.S.’s
only airline regularly carrying
passengers into the Soviet Union,
unilaterally cancelled and ended all
its ﬂights to the USSR just before
the onset of heavy Olympics-
preparatory traffic, on October 29,
1978.

To go or not to go to Moscow:
Afghanistan, when facts are looked
at, provides no reason whatever to
put up barricades. The reverse: does
our planet need still more separa-
tion of peoples and still more ten-
sion? What Better time than right
now for youth from varying
backgrounds to get together to pur-
sue challenges all have in common
and in process to grow toward ap-
preciation- and tolerance of one

/another? —precisely the Olympic
ideal, that the powers in the U.S. so
abhor.

A judge should seek out the full
story from both sides before render-
ing a righteous judgment. Isn’t each
of us suposed to be a judge? Who is
trying to prevent us from seeing the
evidence? The prospect of our ex-
posure to first-hand information at
Moscow worries and frightens
some, lest our judgment not come
down on the side of capitalism and
war. Too bad. While we still have
some freedom of movement:
boycott, no way!

David process, though the difficulty
of achieving a solution, and the
political costs associated with such
an initiative, are likely to be much
higher. But there really is no
choice. A U.S. broker is essential
to the conception of the Camp
David process, as it was originally
put into operation. Now we must
pay the costs. Though the timing of
such initiative remains unclear,
situational constraints, have infact,
madeanother U.S. initiative in the
Camp David process inevitable.

However central the Camp David
process is to the United
States—Middle East policy, con-

centrated efforts in others areas 
must also be made. They cannot be « 
neglected, and may even offer op- - {
portunity. U.S. efforts should be,

developed in Lebanon, and policies

in that area may be a ‘way’ for
developing working relations with 

those entities not currently involved

in the Camp David framework,  /.
well as furthering our interests‘ in M 
the area. In the end, as the situai  
tion becomes increasingly apparent. -. C
that there will-be a new U.S. in-. '
itiative in the area, it is to our ad- 
vantage to at least make note of .
those actors and trends that will .'
shape the environment in which our g5 r=

policy is to be conducted.

_ Tim Grgurich talks with players during a timeout.

Suzanne Pulley Swims Up A Sto

By MARK ALVIN
Pitt News Staff Writer

When Suzanne Pulley started
swimming at a YMCA in her
hometown of Richmond, Virginia
over ten years ago, she had no idea
it would become such a big part of
her life. _

“I was taking lessons at the ‘Y’ ”
said Pulley, “and my mother
thought it would be a good idea for

me to start swimming competetively _

so I decided to give it a try.”

“In high school, we didn’t have a
swimming program, so all the swim-
ming I did before entering college
was in the AAU.”

Pitt wasn't the first school that
Pulley looked at, but she is very
happy to be here. ‘

“I originally planned on enrolling
at North Carolina State, but there
were some problems down there
and I changed my mind,” said
Pulley. “The next school I visited
was Alabama. I was going to go
there, but I ‘talked to a friend of

' mine who swam for Pitt coach Dick

Bradshaw and she told me about
Pitt, so I decided to visit Pitt and

, see what it was like.”

“When I came here I liked coach

C Bradshaw, the pool facilities, and

 

Pittsburgh as a city,” Pulley
remembered. “I think we have the

.best pool in the East, and I really

enjoy living in Pittsburgh.”
Thus far, in her two years at Pitt,

. Pulley has won All-American status

five times. her freshman year, she
was a member of the 200-and
400-yard freestyle relay teams. Last
year, she was a member of the
200-yard medley relay, the 200-yard
freestyle relay, and the 800-yard
freestyle relay. In addition, she just
missed becoming All-American in
the 100-yard individual medley her
freshman year, when she finished
17th nationally.

This years’s AIAW champion-
ship is going to be held in Las
Vegas, Nevada-later this month. In
Las Vegas, Pulley will try to
become an All-American for the
third straight year. She will be a
part of Pitt’s 400-yard medley relay
team, 400-yard freestyle relay team,
and the 800-yard freestyle relay
team.

Pu1ley’s biggest thrill thus far at
Pitt came last year when she gained
All-American status at Trees Pool.
“It was really exciting because I got
to swim in front of my friends, and
because it ‘was Kathy Stetler’s last
meet.” _ W

Stetler is only Pitt’s second four-
time All-American, besides Tony
Dorsett. 1

“Also, it was rewarding because
it is really hard to repeat with so
many good swimmers,” Pulley add-
ed.

“All three of the events are going

to be tough,”said Pulley, “but I

think our best chances are going to
be in the two freestyle relays.”

Pulley was somewhat disap-
pointed in her performance at the
Easterns this year.

“Last year, I finished first in the
100-yard individual medley, but this
year I slipped down to seventh,”
said Pulley. “The reason for this, is
probably because I’m not as strong
as I’ve been my previous. years. It
was really hard for me to get into
shape this season.

“Usually over the summer I just
swim to get in shape,” she said,
“but this year, I’m going to work-
out with weights so I’ll be stronger
for next year.

' “Right now,” said Pulley, ,“I’m
just concentrating on doing the best
I can at nationals.”

lt’s Unanimous, Players Will Miss Grgurich

By MIKE DICHIARA
Asst. Sports Editor
The resignation of Tim Grgurich
as head basketball coach at Pitt was
upsetting and shocking’ to many of

' the players. There was disappoint-

ment expressed by the team over his
leaving but also an understanding

. of the circumstances under which

he left.

Many people don’t have a true
picture of Tim Grgurich, members
of his team said. They see him only
as the coach of a basketball team
that started the season very well and
ended it in slight disappointment.

Tim Grgurich was a man who
was always around when his players
needed him, they said. He was a
man who spent 18-20 hours a day
thinking basketball. He was a man
who did the best he could with what
the administration gave him.

.As junior guard Carlton Never-
son expresed, “He definitely did as
much for us as he possibly could,
both on and off the court.”

“The administration didn’t give
him what he wanted and basketball
was taking time away from his
family life,” said junior Sam Clan-
cy. ‘
Most players expressed that they
felt the main reason for Grgurich’s
resignation was the loss of time with
his family, although that was not
the only one.

“There may have been some
disagreements between him and the
administration, but it’s hard to say
for sure,” said Neverson.

It’s' a fact that the recruiting
budget for basketball has been cut.
Many players felt that Grgurich

didn’t have the full support of the

“administration.

“I think he was disappointed
with the administration and he felt
that due to this lack of support, it
was time to make a move,” said
Dave Olinger, a junior guard.

“I think now that the administra-
tion will have to support a new
coach 100 percent if they want
somebody to stay here,” he con-
tinued.

Neverson agreed, adding, “The
administration probably didn’t do
all they could for him.”

Freshman Paul Brozovich felt

‘Chat Grgurich did the best he could
with whatlittle he was given. ,

‘‘If he doesn’t have the money,
it's (poor recruiting) not his fault,”
he said. “That will be a problem
next year. The new coach won’t be
in the system, so all the good

recruits will be taken.”

The team in general had a very
good relationship with Grgurich
and there was surprise about his
leaving.

“I was very upset when I heard. I
thought he was a very good coach
myself,” said Brozovich. “I heard

rumours but _didn’t t_hinl: mutt‘-.h

Completes Career

By STEVE THOMAS

Pitt News Staff Writer
It was just four years ago that
Gary Siriano of the men’s track

‘ team remembers answering to the

name of “Rico.” There, at Shaler
High School, located on the out-
skirts of Pittsburgh, was where
students turned out in large
numbers to root on their favorite
trackster with chants of “Rico,
Rico.” .

“They were really gung-ho on
track,” said Siriano. “They
brought signsand everything, and
track was a major attraction.”

Siriano first started -running the
100-yard dash and other sprint
events early in his career. As a
sophomore and a member of the
mile relay team, Siriano went on to
the state championships, finishing
12th. His junior year, he joined the
two-mile relay team and went to
states again, this time ﬁnishing
ﬁfth. As a senior, Siraino ran the
mile in the state finals and placed
eighth, despite a pulled thigh mus-
cle which kept him from practicing
one month prior to the champion-
ship competition.

“My senior year was my best,”
said Siriano. “It was a combina-
tion of my success and the motiva-
tion from Shaler High School that
made it great.”

With Pitt offering Siriano a
scholarship, as well as being close to
home, he was lured to the friendly
confines of the Oakland campus for
his freshman year. His family mov-

. ed to Texas soon afterward but

Siriano decided to stay at Pitt
anyway.

During his freshman year,
Siriano sustained a stress fracture in
his foot, halfway through the cross-
country' season, but recovered in
time to run a 4:09 mile during the
outdoor season in a meet at Bloom-
ington, Indiana.

_The' highlight of his sophomore
year was a 4:06 mile run at Ann Ar-
bor, Michigan in the outdoor
season, which clipped three seconds
off his previous best.

Siriano knew there was room for
improvement and he did just that in
his junior year. He finished no
worse than second in eight relays,
while runing the 5000-meter event,
and in the Penn Relays, won the
5000-meter run.

“The Penn Relays is one of the
most prestigious track meets in the
U.S., and winning there was one of
the most significant’ performances
of my life,” said Siriano.

At the conclusion of his junior
year, Siriano headed to Texas for

If men’s volleyball would have an
official ranking of Eastern teams,
no one could overlook the Panthers
as qualifying for a solid third or

- fourth position on that list. In one

short year, the team has risen from
a first season record of 9-21, to the
top of men’s volleyball in the East.

The Panthers have recently
returned from a very successful
weekend in Newark, New Jersey,
where they participated in the

_ Eastern Collegiate Volleyball Open

tournament.

Pitt finished the tournament in a
third place tie with the Cadets of
Army, behind first place Rutgers-
Newark and second place Penn
State. The Panthers finished in a tie
with George Mason in the tourna-
ment’s pool play, which forced the
two teams into a do or die playoff
game, with the winner advancing
into the playoffs.

Pitt defeated George Mason
15-12 and continued into the
semifinals against Rutgers. In the
Rutgers match, the Panthers were
defeated by scores of 3-15 and 5-15.
Assistant coach Mike Hebert con-
sidered the loss a tough one, to an
experienced Rutgers squad.

“Rutgers has a great team,” said
Hebert. “They have established
themselves as the top team in the
East. They had just too much net
strength for us to beat them.” ‘A

- known as "road racing.”

‘\ .
Pitt started off the day facing
East Stroudsburg as their first com-
petition in the six team pool. The
Panthers lost the opener to
Stroudsburg 13-15 before turning
around and recording a 15-11 vic-

the summer to train for his senior
year.

“I give credit to the humidity in
Texas for helping to condition me
in training,” said Siriano.

While he was in the Lone Star
State, Siriano became a member of
the Houston Harriers, a track club
which journeyed throughout Texas
to such cities as San Antonio,
Houston, and Dallas for an event
It was in
one of these marathon-type events
that Siriano took a big step forward
in his track career. He placed se-
cond out of 5000 runners in the
Houston 5-Mile Championship.
The event took place in September,
prior to the beginning of school and
Siriano made an impressive showing
for the Harriers. He finished right

. behind Ron Tabb, one of America’s

top marathoners.
“He was my manager at the Run-

ning Shop, said Siriano. “I was
employed there all summer.”

When Siriano returned to Pitt for
his senior year, he’ qualified for the
cross-country NCAA Nationals,
and missed being an All-America by
10 seconds in the 6.2-mile run.

“My goal is, to qualify for the
NCAA Outdoor Championships in
the 5000-meter run this year,” said
Siriano.

His ambition after graduation is
to attend graduate school here in
Pittsburgh at either Pitt or Du-
quesne to attain an MBA. He is
currently an Economics major.
Siriano would then like to go back
to Texas and work for an oil com-
pany and continue his road-racing
with the Harriers. ,

“It is something ‘ I’ve kept in
mind for a long time,” said Siriano,
referring to his career with the Har-
riers. “I’ll always remember enter-

Siriano enjoys the music of the
rock group ZZ Top (from Texas, of
course), and looks back on his ex-
perience at Pitt as a fond memory.

“I’ve enjoyed running here, and I
would have done it again if offered
