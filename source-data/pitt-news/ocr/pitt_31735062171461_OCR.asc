(CC? To Innovate
City College Changes

by BOB BONN
Assistant News Editor

A- comprehensive program of
cooperation between eight Pitts-
burgh colleges and universities
has been established with the
forming of the City College Con-
gress of Pittsburgh iCCCP D.

An incorporation of all eight
student governments. the union
aims to provide students at Pitt.
Carnegie—Mellon. Point Park. Du-
quesne. Chatham. Robert Morris.
Allegheny County Community Col-
lege. and Carlow with  wide di-
versity of activities and serv-
ices.‘ according to Pitts SG
President Lenny Klavonic.

The first formal meeting of the
CCCP will be next Wednesday and
it will be attended by the chancel-
lor or president of each college.
as well as the SG presidents.

Proposals to be discussed are
numerous. First, a system of
cross-registration on a more reg-
ular basis will be attempted, re-
placing the current system in
which registration in other col-
leges is viewed as a special pro-
gram.

Lnder the proposal. there would
be no limit to the number of
courses taken elsewhere.

Collective programming of an
activity could be accomplished
through the CCCP. Pooling funds
and resources. the city colleges
could develop a giant program on

a particular theme. l~.lnvironmen-
tal Action. for example.

Ticket information and dates
may be centralized through the
new organization, permitting stu-
dents to attend concerts and other
events at any of the participating
campuses. A student newspaper
exchange program is also plan-
ned, as well as a mutual library
exchange.

Finally. a closed-circuit televi-
sion network. to be developed by
Bell Systems. may be formed. in
which each campus would have a
studio. The programming. which
would be readily available at each
college. could present shows on
university and city information.
collected by student reporters.
and shows of interest to the city
students.

"Lots of student money is wast-

ed on each campus.” said Klavon-,
, ic. "which would be saved by a co-

ordinated effort on the part of all
universities in the city pooling
their resources to provide stu-
dents with the best entertainment
program. activities. and services
possible.“

Klavonic speculated on the pos-
sibilities of joint concerts. having
bigger name groups or being held
more often than any one student
government could afford. These
could be held at the Civic Arena.
Syria Mosque. or the Pitt Field
House.

UniVersity’s Fiscal Woes

May Be Eased By Shapp   A

landslide victory over Lieuten-

erick Tuesday has i'esui‘rected
optimism among many mem-
iiers of the l'nivei‘sit_\ coffi-
muiiit_\ aiixioiis about Piti s li-
naiicial future.

Shapp. who won by half a iiiil—

lion votes. has promised to end
Pennsylvanias fiscal crisis. pos-
sibly by enacting a state income
tax. Top administrators here are
convinced that an income tax
must be instituted. if the Coin-
iiionwealth is to provide Pitt the
funds it has requested.

Shapp announced yesterday that

he will convene a special session
of the state legislature early in
December to resolve the state's
money problems before 1971.

During the campaign, Shapp re-

mained noncommittal on the ques-
tion of an income tax, saying only
that he would veto an income tax
unaccompanied by provisions for
tax reform. /

While Shapp refused on election
night to term his triumph a "inan-
date” for an income tax. Alle-
gheny County leaders of both par-
ties iiiade such a claim.

"Apparently. the people felt
they wanted certain services that
wouldn‘t be given to them without
an income tax." Republican Dis-
trict Attorney Robert Duggan ob-
served. commenting on Shapp's
victory. Democrat Leonard Stais—
ey. chairman of the County Com-
missioners. concurred. express-
ing his doubt that "the voters be-
lieved we could do without an in-
come tax.“

Whatever fiscal remedies Shapp
proposes, his views are likely to
be bolstered by the stunning size
of his electoral margin—half a
million votes.

Shapp should also have-less dif-

ficulty getting his programs pass-

that the Senate. as well as the
House. is in Democratic hands.

Shapp. who conferred with some
of the new State Legislatures
probable leaders Wednesday. is
expected to decide soon whether
to try to grapple with Pennsyl-
vanias fiscal problems, before
January.

Unless a tax bill is approved
next month, Shapp and the Legis-
lature will be constitutionally pro-
hibited from considering retro-
active taxes to balance the fiscal

Author Claims law
Repressive To Minors

by STEVE LUBETSKY‘

Jean Strause, author of Up Against the Law: The Legal Status of
Youth Under 21, discussed various aspects of the law in application
to youth Wednesday afternoon at an informal seminar in the Supper
Room, SU.

Miss Strause opened by focusing on drug laws and search and deiz-
ure. Three years ago, she stated, the Federal laws concerning mari-
juana entailed self-incrimination by the possessor and assumed that all
marijuana plants were imported illegally.

She explained that Dr. Timothy Leary. the former Harvard pro-
fessor and notorious drug aduocate. challenged these laws. the former
on groups that it was unconstitutional, and the latter on the grounds that
grass could be grown in the United States. “His contest led to a change
in the Federal laws," Miss Strause declared.

She cited one case in which a teenager arrested for LSD was
threatened with charges of “internal possession” if he didn’t admit the
source of the acid supplies. There is no such crime as ‘internal posses-
sion,”’ the author remarked, “but the boy wasn't aware of it, and he
couldn’t find a lawyer to represent him.

“Often,“ she contended. “police officers deliberately plant the

evidence, and they file false charges.

“Sometimes they employ the ‘dropsy testimony.‘ in which they

. see something drop from one’s hands. and they arrest the person on

circumstantial evidence."

Another incident Miss Strause cited involved two people in a hotel
room talking about their experiences with marijuana. A detective
standing outside the room overheard the conversation and arrested
them.

Miss Strause also mentioned the legal implications of searches in-
volving minors. She said that “if a minor lives with his parents. they
must give permission for a search to be conducted without a search
warrant. Consent is not necessary. however. if a warrant has been
authorized."

The writer then turned to the broader question of the legal status of
youth. “The theory," she maintained. "is that kids have no legal stand-
ing, and therefore cannot take legal action. If a parent dies and leaves a
child a large sum of money. it is converted into trusts and inaccessable

 
 
  

Miss Strause referred to a case
in New York in which an 11-year-
old boy passed around a petition
calling for his grade school prin-

Leland Starnes--Actor and Director

Living A Double Life

by JUDY VOLLMER
Assistant News Editor

With an easy warmth and a
mood of straight forward casual-
ness. Leland Starnes synthesizes
and lives the roles of director and
actor. Starnes. in his third year
in the Universitys Speech and
Theatre Arts Department. teach-
es directing at the University and
directs student productions.

Periodically. Starnes devotes
special time to acting in order to

refresh understanding and in--

volvement between actor and di-
rector. "The problem of the actor
keeps.developing into something
new. something that the director
might not see. What I have to say
to my actors had to be redefined
and intensified by my own contin-
ued experiences as an actor."

As a channel toward redefining
and examining the “actor prob-
lem." Starnes is presently per-
forming as Richard. the lead role
in Edward Albees Everything in
the Garden at the Pittsburgh
Playhouse. "The play was adapt-
ed by Giles Cooper and ‘Ameri-
canized." explained Starnes.
"Cooper has shifted the mood and
the emphasis situation and set of
emotions clearly and distinctly.
Its a near great play. certainly a
crystal play of its time.

"Everything in the Garden. like
Virginia. uses the marital situa-
tion to make a social criticism and
to oversimplify grandly. The

‘whole inane marital ping-pong is

set up, but it starts to veer and
shift. The idea is a good and val-
uable one, though it seems to be-
come muddled somewhere with-
in black comedy.

"The theme of Everything,
Starnes continued, “deals with
married couples trying to keep up
with the material values of their
immediate society. My character
does not actively care that much
about his material and economic
values. and that apathy is the
source of conflict in his marriage.
He ventually crumbles and falls.

On the genre of black comedy.
Starnes said. "This type of drama
of our time mixes together all
kinds of emotions strangely. We
laugh at what is dead serious. re-
leasing our feelings about issues.
This emotional release is perhaps
most brilliantly seen in Waiting
for Godot.”

action of the audience varies from
horror to comical hysteria.
“Their reaction depends on the
actor’s individual performance.
The viewer can discern from the
play what the actor’s tilt tells him
to think. The force of the actor’s
vision and the focus of his aggres-
sion must be clear cut and must
make a statement.”

Starnes stated that he has al-
ways wanted to play George in
Who’s Afraid of Virginia Woolf?
He added. “It‘s worth the trou-
ble." He also expressed an inter-

est in the role of Malvolio in,

Shakespeares Twelfth Night.

“I yearn for Shakespeare as an
actor and a director. The prob-
lems with Shakespeare are tough-
er in a different way from any-
thing else. I have done Theseus in
Midsummer Night’s Dream —
badly. There's a physical problem
in getting the clean. neat. metered
lines out with the proper breath
and meter. But it's all full of a
naturalistic style that I hunger
for.

“As far as actual perform-
ance." Starnes revealed. "I don‘t
believe it until I've done it again.
Most importantly. I have to be
physically okay. I can't do some-

thing with mind and emotions un- 

less I am physically‘ sound. The
actor. through his whole being.
has to form energy upward. When
he is through. he is tired. physi-
cally. emotionally. It is a good
tired."

Recently there has been a great
deal of confusion surrounding the
proposed move of Central Print-
ing into the facilities the Theatre
Arts Department uses as its The-
atre Shop.

According to Dr. Richard H.
McCoy. associate dean of the Col-
lege of Arts and Sciences. the Uni-
versity had planned to move Cen-
tral Printing into the Theatre
Shop when its lease on a building
on Henry St. expires in April.

The Theatre Shop was to be
moved into the room which is now
the Carpenter Shop. while the Car-
penter Shop was to be moved into
Benedum Hall. which is due to be
completed within the next couple
months.

Members of the Theatre Arts

Department objected to the pro-'

posed move for two reasons. Dr.
George Bogusch, head of the Stu-
dio Theatre, explained the the
first reason was that “no one had
ever informed us.”

He went on to say that the de-
partment first learned of the pro-
posal when Richard Evans. tech-
nical director. saw people meas-
uring and checking around the
Theatre Shop. llpon asking. he

was informed that the men were
checking to see how Central Print-
ing would fit into the room.

Many people saw this secrecy
as an indication of a plot to hurt
the Theatre.

The second reason the Theatre
Department found fault with the
proposal was that they found the
new facilities unacceptable. Dr.
Bogusch describes the Carpenter

Shop as being of a “peculiar shape
with slanted halls at right angles,
making movement of equipment
difficult.” It also has columns
running down the middle of the
room which ruin the floor space.

The Theatre Department imme-
diately put in a formal complaint
and also asked its audience to pe-
tition the University.

Dean McCoy explained that no

Theatre Arts Threatened By Proposed Move

harm was meant by the decision.
The whole confusion was casued
by a lack of communication. Cen-
tral Planning thought that the Car-

. penter Shop would give the The-

ater larger and better facilities.

When the planning committee
found out that the Theatre De-
partment found this plan unac-
ceptable, it came up with three al-
ternative schemes that will be ex-
plored to find which meets the
needs of both departments.

Dr. Jack Matthews. chairman
of the Speech Department. is
pleased with the Universitys re-
sponse to their complaints. "I
don‘t see a dire plot. . . to kill the
theatre." he said. "Once we made
it clear that the plan was unsatis-
lactor_v. we began to have confer-
ences on other ways to meet the
needs of us and other sections. "

Dr. Matthews went on to say
that he feels that the only mistake
made was the University's “fail-
ing to communicate the plan to us
early in the game.“

There is apparently confusion

in the Central Planning Office
also. Clarence Biers,'head of Cen-
tral Printing admitted, when con-
tacted, that he was not even
aware that a move had been plan-
ned.

"All that I know." he said. "is
that I've been asked to draw up a
floor plan for the stacks room
(presently the Theatre Shop).
Hopefully." he continued. "I'll
get to develop plans for several
other rooms also."

He is aware that their lease will
be up in April. His reaction to that
problem is “that's not my bag ei-
ther." He realizes that they will
either have to move or renew
their lease. but he has no ideas
what has been in the planning.

Dean McCoy offered his inter-
pretation of why Biers has not
been informed of the four suggest-
ed plans. He feels that it is be-
cause “Central Planning is try-
ing to give the Theatre priority.”
The dean is positive some move
will be made, but just when it will
be he is not sure.

In a recent column in The

and Marxism. It is the opinion
of this writer that LeBlanc‘s
analysis contained some serious
flaws. I want to comment speci-

italism.

We are first told that "the
essence of conservatism . . . has
been resistance to any social
change, which threatens the
wealth, power. and comforts of

argue. as LeBlanc does. that
nineteenth century conserva-
tives were opposed to “any social

tive genius himself. Edmund
Burke. made this quite clear in
his many writings. From Burke:

A state without/ the means of some
change is without the means of its conser-
vation. Without such means it might even
rislr the loss of that part of the constitution
which it wished the most religiously to pre-
serve.

Rather than opposing ‘any
social change." what the conser-
vatives feared was the spectre
of a violent revolution in which
revolutionaries sought to remake
totally the nature of man.

Viewed in this manner. Burke
could justify the discontent of
the American rebels because
their aims. right up till the 1776
war. were limited. At the same
time. he had no
sympathy at all
for the French
Revolution since
he despised the
ideological total-
ism of the Jacobians.

Modern conservatism is a tu-
gsion of two intellectual streams —
inineteenth century conservatism
gland nineteenth century liberal-
gism.

~ Society and Tradition

It is true that the nineteenth
icentury conservative stressed or-
ider as the primary goal of society
iand tradition as an important
Ecorollary. They realized full well
Ethat without order. no society
§could achieve even minimal pro-
ggress.

” » Following my coverage of the Leftist speaker. Joe Stark. and
he,Palestine Liberation Movement of which he spoke. I feel
it elaboration is in order. I accepted the assignment. although
tark. in no way reflected my own personal viewpoints. I felt
hat most of what he said was nonsense.

First of all. the Israeli Government is by no means oppres-
ing anybody. Arabs living in Israel have 100 percent more rights
han their brethren living in other Arab countries. They can
ote. earn a living. and enjoy freedom of speech. rights which
re not enjoyed under most Arab regimes.

y I The only privileges that Arab Israelis lack are the option to
erve in the army and the chance to court the Prime Ministry,
"hich are for obvious security reasons. i

Granted. there are Arab refugees. but the Israeli Govern-
ment is doing its best to accommodate them. There are Jewish
efugees as well who are no better off.

Moreover. how can Israel do anything substantial unless there
s a peaceful settlement first‘? The real villains responsible for
he plight of the Palestinians are the Arab leaders. who are using
srael as an excuse to evade responsibility towards their own peo-
le. ‘ '

. In answer to the assumption that Israel is "an agent of West-
rn imperialism. I want to point out that there are no United
tates troops stationed in Israel right now. nor did Israel request
ny.

All that she has requested is the equipment necessary to off-
et the weapons that the Soviet Union is supplying Egypt. The
nvolvement of the U.S.S.R. in the Middle East conflict is where
mperialism is exemplified.

Finally. the Israelis never chased the Palestinians from their
omes. They left voluntarily, because of pressure from the Arab
overnments, which jurged Mthern“ 1 to leave until the destruction of
?1eState0f.I$ra?1~-   ‘ I I  I “  ’ 7   ”

He then sounded a warning
which should be carefully read
by those who cry "revolution
now."

in the weakness of one liind of authority,
and in the fluctuation of all, the officers of
an army will .emain for some time mutin-
ous and lull of faction, until some popular
genera, who understands the art of concili-
ating . . . shall draw the eyes of all men
upon himself. Armies will obey him on his
personal account . . . the moment in which
that event shall happen, the person who
really commands the army is your master;
the master of your king, the master of your
Assembly, the master of your whole republ-
lic . . . . .

The second major stream of
contemporary American con-
servatism is nineteenth century
liberalism. Just as the conser-
vative stressed order. so did

the liberal stress personal free-

dom and the market economy.

With the expansion of the
market economy. old vestiges
of the aristocracy died out. A
new class of producers and en-
trepreneurs appeared.

Rather than protecting "the
wealth. power and comforts
of the dominant social strata."
as LeBlanc argues. the nine-
teenth century liberal land the

eminent economist Ludwig von

Mises describes it. For in a
market economy. Everyone —
you. me. even LeBlanc- has

an opportunity to compete for
consumers‘ dollar votes.

Arbiter Quality

The market is colorblind.
Questions of race. color. or
ethnic background count not at
all. Quality of the product is
the final arbiter as to who will
succeed and who will fall.

In reality. capitalism was the
best thing that ever happened
to the poor. Through the divi-
sion of labor. the standard of
living of even the lowest seg-
ment of society was enhanced.

Many of the poor entered the
marketplace and became capital-
ists themselves. It is ironic that
people who did work their way
up from the bottom of society
on ability. such as Andrew Car-

. negie. are forever held in con-

tempt by some of LeB1anc‘s

socialist friends.

ing public policy in America

per balance between order and
freedom. It can only be con-
sidered a defense of the status
quo in that the conservative is
frightened by the prospect of
America adopting a tradition of
violent revolution a la France.
and hence he seeks to defend
the American Constitution. (Bear
in mine that revolution is defin-
ed so as to include ll) a violent
overthrow of the existing gov-
ernment. and (2) an attempt to

Beyone that. the conservative

garding public policy in Ameri-
ca. Far from ignoring the is-
sues of poverty. racism. etc..
the conservative feels that these
problems can best be solved by
private solutions via the free
market economy. which has
shown itself to be the greatest
vehicle the world has ever seen
for the elinination of poverty.

servatism is neither against

It was Halloween night and for the first time
‘in six years. I was really missing the trick and
treat outings that had so brightened the dull au-
tumns of my childhood.

More than a month before the witches" sabbath.
friend Ann had invited me to the party and cir-
cumstances had led to a crescendo of anticipa-
tion. The clouds had been pouring down their
wet oblivion for several days and the earth was
soggy and adhesive."

The “gathering” (the words of the host) was
set in an old mansion in Squirrel Hill, one of these
‘houses with red velvet brocade wallpaper and ser-
vants’ quarters in the back.

It was evident from the street that the quiet
and darkness of the huge edifice contrasted with
the sit-on-the-floor-judy-collins—bell-bottom gigs
which characterize my life style.

All was quiet in a house that was to become
the instant asylum for four hours of personal in-
sanity.

Ann was the link; she taught with host Lewis
in an area parochial school, but she had been
adamant about his being “one of us.”

Don‘t worry." she. had cautioned so many
times before that night. "Hes weird like we are.
Hes told me all about his friends."

We were ushered in ceremoniously and of-
fered "Hooch". “Beah'.’. Really. my deah. we
don't have beah heah." Lewis spoke in a thick ac-
cent. a mixture of English and Irish tones. He
was born and raised in Pittsburgh. But W“cul-
ture" was important to him and his “1803 ma-
hoooogany“ dining room table.

Lewis was a theatrical fag; probably not a homo-

sexual; he was too obvious, too dramatic for that »

reality. He was playing his role, however, and it
was acceptable in his “circles.”

I plunked into a comfortable-looking armchair
to watch the scenes as they were played out. The
musicless air accentuated the conversation. pick-
ing up twittering tones and masculine bellows.
Words flew like winter-trapped mosquitos.._ a

Jack was swaggering in the center of the mass-
ive living room. promising a bevy of tintillated
nuns in traditional garb his set of John Wayne
impressions. His chest heaved manly.. his voice
protruded from somewhere in the middle of his
throat. relishing each successful verbal conquest.

Theyre kidding. I told myself. But he wasn‘t
and they weren't. I left the room and missed the
show.

Armed with the "hooch". I sat down . . . to
observe. No one approached me or looked in my
direction. My friends were preoccupied in other
rooms and I felt as if they had never existed.‘

Little games were going on all around. Lewis
was leading a ten verse rendition of "Rock of

-Ages“ and "0 My Mama". done in contrapuntalyy, ‘
rounds; heavily made-up parishoner was seatedwi’

“decently” on the wide lap of a non-uniformed
priest and both jumped up quickly when the "hus-
band figure" accompained by a red-faced non came
into the room: two men sat menacingly across from
one another. talking "deeply" of the merits of
stoagies and hunting season.

I took the initiative to "get in with it“ with
a challenge. I tried to talk to Jack.

“I, uh, own and manage, a food chain. Hotels,
uh, schools, colleges, motels, all across the coun-
try. It’s not a small operation, you see,” he was
answering one of those “what do you do” ques-
tions.

“Sure, I, uh, know all about SAGA—good work.
Oh, you’ve worked for them? Tell me what went
on.” A

“Well, you’re just a student. Someday, you’ll

get into the big, bad world. hahahahaha.”

Bill took out his guitar and sat down beside
me. He was good. He wrote his own songs. Others
joined us on the floor until some of the guests
were "singing along". But it upset Jack that
he wasn‘t the center of attention.

“I can do impressions,” he began interminably,
“Can you play one of the them songs from the
John Wayne movies . . . Red Dust maybe?” Every-
body laughed.

“You’re really bothering me”, I vomited the
words. Verbal dry heaves. Everybody laughed
again.

“What’s with you, Miss Hostile? I bet you,
uh, can’t do impressions, especially not of John
Wayne,” Laughter.

“I’m not being hostile. I just think you’re act-
ing like an ass.” I was angry now. This time,
no one even smiled. The nuns were the first to
leave. Then the others. Then even Bill.

“Now I don’t, uh, know why you’d say that,”
he said to me quietly, “You’re, uh, not the most
attractive girl here.” . . r

Editor. The Pitt News:

This letter might at first sound
like the usual mediocre "my ex-
periences discredit you theory”
type idea. Read on anyway. I think
I speak for a whole class of peo-
ple.

There are a lot things going
around now: like the flu and
o.d'ing-—and Nixon and Broder-
ick. The latter two things are
characterized by a lot of “I want
this for you. the hard working
Americans: the good people in
this country."

Well. by definition «or implied
definition) I am one of these peo-
ple. I was raised in steel working
community. The people work and
pay their taxes. They are by no
stretch of the imagination in the
same genre as the postal work-
ers: you know the hard working
people that'the President called
the army out against when they
demanded a fair slice of the pie.

Page 6—THE PITT NEWS—-—Friday, November 6, I970

    

Bob Ging’s editorial “But Some

- Won’t Make It Back,” which was

published in the July 30, 1970,
issue of The Pitt News, bemoaned
the rising cost of fall tuition with
that blend of vulgarity and smug-
ness which has become a Pitt

‘ News hallmark. His major com-

plaint was that higher tuition
costs could drive worthy students
out of the University for lack of
money.

I wrote a reply to that editorial.
a reply which was not printed un-
til Sept. 4, 1970 — over a month
later! I stated that Ging and his
Pitt News coherts were in part
responsible for rising tuition costs
and that they should refrain from

criticizing tuition increases as"

long as they stuffed their pockets
with money gained through cost
hikes. '

An editorial comment was ap-
pended to my letter. It called me
to task for two errors of act in my
letterzc

1. Pitt News staffers are paid
in Student Government-supplied
salaries, not University scholar-
ships, and 2. Credit is issued for
work in a journalism seminar.
not for staff work as I claimed.

Ireplied in a letter mailed Sept.
18 to the Pitt News office. The let-
ter was never published.

I now reiterate my defense. 1.
The source of my first error was
The Pitt News. In the Oct. 13.
1969. issue. then-editor Dave
Tiernan claimed that staff mem-
bers would receive “merit schol-
arships." The subject never re-
appeared in The Pitt News——nev-
er. that is. until the News attack-
ed me for accepting its own in-
accurate reporting.

2. Although Tiernan‘s October.
1969. editorial did specify that
the News staff members would
receive credit for a seminar. the
course was not included in the

January. 1970. Time Schedule
or the Spring-Summer Time
Schedule.

The course was not mentioned.
as far as I can determine. after
October. 1969. in The Pitt News.
Apparently the News did not keep
the University any better inform-
ed than the students. for both the
College and the English Depart-
ment told me that the course is

’ restricted to News personnel.

Once again, Pitt News sloppy
and incomplete reporting led me
astray.

Therefore, while noting that er-
rors did exist in my letter pub-
lished Sept. 4. I also note that had
The Pitt News reported its own
machinations with any degree of
consistency. accuracy or honesty.
the errors would not have been
possible.

Moreover the corrections do
not make Ging any less guilty of
money-grubbing hypocrisy. His
Student Government salary must
surely help explain why the Acti-
vities Fee has expanded.

Moreover. the News effectively
drains tuition money in the form
of payment received from the
University for "subscriptions to
the News for faculty and admin-
istrative use.“ (Or at least Tier-
nan said so in October. 1969. Per-
haps the’ current editor would
care to clear up this instance of
Pitt News pork barrel.)

If we accept Tiernans word.
we have the curious spectacle of
students paying higher tuition to
underwrite unsolicited
scholarships to a paper pro-
duced by student-salaried writers
who complain about higher tuition.

Money-grubbing hypocrisy is
the best interpretation which can
be placed on such a situation.

My experience in trying to cor-
rect Ging the Great has led me to
several conclusions: 1. That The
Pitt News cannot or will not ex-
pose its own preoccupation with
self-aggrandizement to public
scrutiny: 2. That the News will
not hesitate to run up University
costs while at the same time it
blames the higher costs of edu-
cation upon others: 3. That the
News will repress attempts to cri-
ticize it and that it will shift the
responsibility of its own errors
to those who. like myself. accept
its word at face value.

I can only wonder that students
continue to allow their pockets to
be picked by a paper which is both
shoddy and vicious—The Pitt
News.

I ' - -"The Editor, The Pitt News:

The Editor. The Pitt News:

I am replying to Steve Piller’s
letter (The Pitt News, Oct. 14 ).

1. Vice-President Agnew is
quite justified in his use of the
term “radiclib." Although it ob-
viously glosses over important
differences. it does describe im-
portant similarities. The similar-
ities are important. for they set
"radical-liberalism" off from
other political positions. which
can. despite their differences. be
described as a reasonably coher-
ent and separate alternative.

To be explicit. the great differ-
ence that divides political theories
today can be described in terms
of the collectivist-individualist di-
chotomy. Collectivism is the be-
lief that the collective. or the
group. is more important than the
individual: individualism is the
converse.

The Collectivists are the revol-
utionaries. radicals. ultra-liber-
als. and contemporary liberals;
the individualists are the moder-
ates. conservatives. and classical
liberals.

individualists do not reject the
value of social relationships. nor
do they reject social obligations.
but they believe that these should
be voluntary. Collectivists reject
voluntarism and substitute for it
the full power of the state and will
sacrifice any individual right or
moral standard for the good of
the collective.

Although the difference might
sometimes be expressed in terms
of “supporting the President.“ the
ultimate difference is deeper.

The second reason for classify-
ing liberalism and socialism to-
gether is that the premisses of the
former. when pushed far enough.
result in the latter. Moreover. the
moral relativism of contempor-
ary liberalism leads to moral par-
alysis. which causes contempor-
ary liberals to tolerate. if not en-
courage. extremism. (A few lib-
erals seem to have awakened. al-
though it is chilling to think that
it has taken more than a few
bombings——plus an election—to do
it.)

Third. that liberalism contains
within itself the ideological seeds

  

of socialism can be demonstrated
historically. It is no accident that
thegreat John Stuart Mill started
as a good liberal but degenerated
into a socialist late in life. Gal-
braith is another example. (Inci-
dentally. I never called him a
Marxist. for I do not know if he is
one.)

Perhaps the best evidence for
consigning liberalism and social-
ism to the same bag is the follow-

‘mg:

“The American people will never
knowingly adopt socialism. But, un-
der the name of Liberalism they will
adopt every fragment of the Social-
ist program, until America will one
day be a Socialist nation——without
knowing it happened.”

That's Norman Thomas speak-
ing. Remember him‘? He ran six
times for President on the Social-
ist Party ticket. It seems to me
that even if he never won. his
ideas did. As anyone who has tak-
en an elementary course in Politi-
cal Science can tell you. one of the
main reasons for the relative fail-
ure of third parties in this country
is that one (or both) of the two
major parties has usually co-
opted them by adopting part or all
of their program. (And the co-op-
tation is by no means confined to
Democrats. )

So you see. Piller. the Vice-
President is quite justified in
lumping liberals and radicals
socialists together.

2. Hopefully I have disproved
Pillers claim that I have a dis-
torted sense of history and that I
tend to see things in "black-and-
white" terms. But I'm pleased
that he brought the subject up. for
it gives me an excuse to make the
point that no one is more guilty of
this charge than Marxists.

These people think dialectical-
ly. which means thinking in terms
of extreme and conflicting op-

Letters
Pi||er’s Letter Sliced On Agnew cut

posites. This is why they interpret
history as a series of conflicts be-
tweeen economic classesztheir
ideological blinders do not allow
them to see the world in any other
terms. Although this way of think-
ing might yield some occasional if
limited insights. it cannot be an
adequate interpretation of his-
tory. or of any subject to which it
might be applied. (Now please.
Piller. don‘t write an impassioned
letter to the editor of The Pitt
News complaining that I have
called you a Marxist.)

3. Piller charges me with hav-
ing a closed mind. Hopefully I
have disproved that. too. Besides
the above outline of the political
spectrum. and the analysis of lib-
eralism‘s relation to radicalism
and socialism. I would have hoped
that anyone who is a member of
YAF and who has a strong inter-
est in and some grasp of Marxism
would be able to avoid this change.

4. I don‘t know who smuggled
the "American dream“ into the
argument. but it wasn‘t me. I do
not recall having tried to convince
anyone either that capitalism was
perfect or that the American
dream has been realized. and I do
not know how Piller came to think
that I did.

He is almost as good as Rich-
ard .VIcDonough at misreading my
letters. Of course. I do believe.
and I am prepared to argue. that
capitalism is the best possible
economic system and that the
American dream is a legitimate
ideal.

5. Finally. I am getting rather
tired of having my letters mis-
read. If Messrs. Piller. McDon-
ough. and Cohen exemplify the
present student generation —
which has been called “America's
greatest and brightest hope“ and
similar slop——then I can only des-
pair for the future of humanity.

Sincerely.

Dear Richard Leavy:

Some comments on the campus
reactions to the election and to
The Pitt News pre-election edi-
torial “Politics Crooked So Just
Ignore It" would seem to be in
order.

It does seem that amthy reigns
supreme. On this campus there-
sponse to the election measured
in terms of the number of students
attending candidate meetings on
campus and the response to the
Citizenship Information Center
has been at best indifferent. Yet.
I don't think it is fair to say that
involvement has withered. The
fact is that most people. young or
old. have never bothered to be-
come involved at all.

To say that participatory demo-
cracy has failed is perhaps to say
that it has never been tried. It
would seem fair to remember
that until the middle of the 1860's
vast numbers of our population
were not merely disenfranchised
but were literally enslaved. Until
1920 women were unable to vote.
So it is only within the‘- last hun-
dred years (with these groups
taken together) that a majority
of our citizenry has been even leg-
ally had the right of participation.

Student participation is a fairly
recent phenomenon. This is due to
many reasons which certainly
can't be handled here but a super-
ficial analysis would indicate that
the war in Southeast Asia has
forced an issue on young people in
an unprecedented fashion. The
McCarthy campaign of 1968 was
the first campaign in history to at-
tract large numbers of students.
The attraction to that campaign
was on the issue of Vietnam and
peace. an issue which directly ei-
ther had or would affect young
people.

A Few More Wind It

After the campaign of 1968.
many young people felt that their
period of ''involvement‘‘ was over
——the system was resistant to
change and that is was hopeless.
This. I believe. is absolutely falla-
cious. First. I think the passage of
the Voting Rights Act of 1970
came out of a belief that not only
could young adults be active and
influencial politically but also that
young adults were anxious and
ready to become politically active.

Second. it would seem to me
that "involvement" denotes long-
term committment. The shortest
legislative term is only two years
long—a very short term as any
congressman would attest. It is
true that the mechanism of politi-
cal change is very slow but to say
that things can‘t change is unfair
without firm commitment of in-
volvement to the political sys-
tem.

Third. it should be remember-

_ ed that that the "general popula-

tion" is apathic. So any group of
people who become politically ac-
tive will have political influence.
if only by their activism. This is
one area where there does not
seem to be a "generation gap"-
generally. everyone seems to be
in a state of despondent apathy.

I must agree that this election

campaign has not been one of
great excitement. Many of the
candidates seemingly tried to hide
the
them. But now November 3. 1970.
is past. Another election will oc-
cur in approximately six months.
We are here to provide the infor-
mation~—interested people in this
community can chart the course.

 POW Aggressors 

The Editor. The Pitt News:

The Pitt News carried an arti-
cle "Help to Release a POW“ in
its Oct. 25 issue. The article was
accompanied by a photograph of
a pathetic looking man sitting on
a bench—presumably. a POW.

From reading the article. one
gets the picture (whether it is de-
liberately intended by the author
or otherwise) of the Vietnamese
people as inhuman criminals who
have no sense of fair play.

I think the author is fighting for
the wrong issue. Instead of peti-
tioning the Vietnamese. the au-
thor should fight against U.S. im-
perialist policy—so that no more
troops can be sent overseas for

     

issues rather than clarify.

Up

The POWs are the people who
had been dropping thousands and
thousands of tons of bombs and
chemicals on the Vietnamese peo-
ple. It is unfortunate that these
POWs had allowed themselves to
be instruments of U.S. imperilist
aggression. If they had resisted
the order to bomb and had got
themselves landed in jail. then I
think everyone should fight for
their release. I would myself.

The author maintains that the

aggression.

Why isn't a big  

coinpany like General Electric
oing more to clean up  

the environment?

How much can one company do
to clean up the environment?

Until the problems of pollution
are under control-—until its effects
are reversed-—no company can ever
be doing ”enough."’

What follows is a listing of
things General Electric is doing to
ease environmental problems.
Some are new. Some are as old as
twenty-five years.

Should we be doing more?
Yes, of course. Every company

, should. These are only a few of the
more important ones. But every day
sees us take more steps in many
more directions.
> General Electric is working
toward a process that will use
bacteria to convert garbage into a
high-protein food for cattle. One
possible answer to the mounting

‘garbage problem.

> Modern, pollution-free mass transit
from General Electric is carrying
more and more commuters into cities
without their cars.

> GE pioneered the development of
nuclear power plants. A nuclear

plant makes electricity without
making smoke. While there is still

the problem of thermal effects, it's
being tackled on a site-by-site basis
and can be solved. But for now,
increasing demands for power can
be met without an increasing
output of air pollution.

> GE has developed a waste-
treatment unit to significantly
reduce the water pollution from
ships and boats.

> We have been chosen by the
federal government to solve the
problem of jet—engine noise for the
aviation industry. Our present jet is
already quieter than those on the
passenger planes of the Sixties, and

yet it's nearly three times as powerful.

> GE designed and built an

undersea habitat called ”Tektite.”
Several teams of scientists have lived
in the habitat while studying coral-
reef ecology and ocean pollution.

> We’re designing an earth-resources
satellite which will be used for a
worldwide survey of the oceans.

A first step toward the ultimate
control of water pollution.

> Our newest jet airplane engine,
for the DC-10, is designed to be
smoke-free. Of course, there’s more
to jet exhaust than just smoke. And
our goal is to one day make them
run totally clean.

> General Electric makes high-
temperature vortex incinerators for

the complete combustion of many
types of solid waste. Complete
combustion drastically reduces the
amount of leftover ash, as well as
virtually eliminating air pollutants.

The problems of the environ-
ment are many. And some of the
solutions will be difficult and
costly. But, as you can see, we're
working on them.

Why are we running this ad?

We're running this ad, and
others like it, to tell you the things
General Electric is doing about the
problems of man and his
environment today.

The problems concern us
because they concern you. We’re a
business and you are potential
customers and employees.

But there’s another, more
important reason. These problems
will affect the future of this country
and this planet. We have a stake in
that future. As businessmen. And,
simply, as people.

We invite your comments.

Cats, Irish Clash Before 60,000

by JERRY’ MYERS

Tomorrow in the small community of
South Bend. Ind.. a battered corps of Pitt
Panthers will tackle what many consider
the best team in college football. the Irish
of Notre Dame. before a capacity crowd of

60.000 people.

The Irish. returning home after two
successive road games against Navy and
Missouri. are riding on the crest of a six
game winning streak that has featured
victories over the likes of Northwestern
l35l14). Purdue (48-0). Michigan State (29-
0). Army (51-10>. Missouri (24-7) and Navy
<56-7).

"This is one of the best offensive clubs
in Notre Dame history." said Bob Timmons
who scouted the Irish for Pitt. "They have
so many offensive weapons. Quarterback
Joe Theismann is the key."

Theismann, a candidate for the Heisman
Trophy, has passed for 1,198 yards and 11
touchdowns with 80 completions in 126
attempts. His prime target is Tom
Gatewood who has flagged in 49 passes for
754 yards and seven TDs, which is best in
the country for receivers.

Medwid

“Hes real dangerous with the run on the
throw (1.462 yards on 195 plays) and in
addition he has a good football head."

 

Timmons added‘ "He automatics a lot and.

takes advantage of any weakness you might
give him."

“I go into Saturdays game with a heavy
heart.“ comments Panther Coach Carl
DePasqua. “Theres no question Notre
Dame is the best team we‘ve faced to date.
They've got the best offensive team in the
country. I can tell you this. they don't make
many mistakes."

In Cub-Lion Battle

by MARTY HELLMAN

A rematch between last years Big 33 quarter-
backs. Bob Medwid of the west and Steve Joachim
of the east. shapes up today as the Pitt and Penn
State freshman football teams conclude their sea-

sons at Pitt Stadium.

Medwid. who was 14-for-25 in the Pitt Cubs first
game against the WVU frosh. returns to the start-
ing lineup after sitting out last weeks victory over

Kent State.

Joachim guided the Nittany frosh to a 48-20 win
over WVU in the squads only game this season. He
was 10-for-21 against the Mountaineers and hit for

one aerial touchdown.

Both signal callers have ample support in their
respective backfields. Clair Wilson, John Chatman
and Stan Ostrowski, who combined for a total of
217 yards rushing last Friday against Kent State,
provide the Cubs with an excellent ground attack.

John Capaletti. who gained 133 yards against the
will start at left halfback.

Little Mountaineers.
while Tom Donchez is the Lions fullback.

A big advantage that the Cubs have over the

Lions is manpower. Five of the PSU squad play both
offense and defense. while none of the Cubs goes

both ways.

Cubs Coach Bill Quinter real-
izes the potential of the Lions.
“We tried to recruit a lot of their
players last year,” he said.

In last weeks game- the de-.
fense held KSU to only nine pass
completions in 24 attempts.

F ullbacks Shift To Defense

by ED CONLEY ’
Sports Editor

All-American Larry DiNardo leads an
all-star offensive line that has blasted
opponents defensive lines apart. Ed
Gulyas, Denny Allan, Bill Bar: and Bob
Minnix comprise a backfield that has
rushed for 1,134 yards. The lowest average
per game is Bill Barz’ 4.0 average in 66
carries.

"Their offensive line is something.“
continued Timmons. “they just blow you
out of there. Guard Larry DiNardo is
tremendous."

Clarence Ellis leads the Irish secondary
and linebacker Tim Kelly directs the
defense. Notre Dames defensive squad has
held opponents to an average of 6.3 points
per game and 209.1 yards. "Their offense
controls the ball so much the defense
doesn't have the pressure on it.“ said
Timmons.

The Panthers, on the other hand, are
slowly recovering from the battering they
received at Syracuse. A considerable
amount of shifting around -— both
offensively. and defensively—has occured in
the Panther’s line-up. DePasqua has
announced that Phil Sgrignoli, hard-
running fullback, will be starting on the
defensive squad at the linebacker position.
Another fullback, Lou Julian, will also see
some linebacking action.

The switches have resulted from Dave
McGrath’s reinjuring of a thigh that has
been bothering him all season and Ralph
Cindrichs ankle operation. Joe Carrol.
starting right linebacker is doubtful with a
charley horse. completing the injured trio
of starting linebackers.

Norm Smith will be moved up into the

defensive end slot. resulting_ from the
doubtful status of Hank Alford. Defensive

tomorrows game against mighty
Notre Dame. To combat the near-
ly unbelievable misfortune Pitt
Coach Carl DePasqua is doing
some shuffling.

For Phil Sgrignoli the switching
means a chance to start a game
for the Panthers. and for Lou Ju-
lian the maneuvering means a
chance to get into some of the
gridiron action.

Both are fullbacks. Sgrignoli
has been the number two fullback
in DePasquas plans. with Julian
playingwer. not playing behind
him. But against Notre Dame to-
morrow they‘ll both be on defense
——at linebacker.

Sgrignoli, the guy man fans
wanted to see starting ahead of
top fullback Tony Esposto, is cur-
rently running at first team
strong side linebacker in practice
sessions, and Julian is listed on
the second team at theother out-
side. post, behind Ken Shnmaker.

The pair of big guys have play-

Both were linebackers and full-
backs in high school. and Julian
remained at the two positions in
his freshman year at Pitt.

Sgrignoli toyed with lineback-
ing for a week during his fresh-
man spring. but decided against
the defensive unit. He was playing
behind All-America hopeful Ralph
Cindrich. which appeared to indi-

Booters Clash
With WVU

    

The Pitt booters will return hom from Slippery Rock to host West
Virginia in their last home match of the season. tomorrow. in Pitt Sta-

dium at2p.m.

_ Pitt Coach Leo Bemis considers the teams to be evenly matched.
but predicts that the Mountaineers will be unusually aggressive. The
West Virginia booters consider their season successful only if they de-

feat Pitt.

Bemis states that West Virginia is equal [0 Kent State. whom Pitt
easily defeated. but their intense feeling of rivalry will have to be taken

into account.

Glee Club
Stops IM

°Machine’

by STEVE WILLIAMS

The Mens Glee Club. loosers
of their first two games. defeated
the independent league leading
Machine. 20-12.

John Dorsey received the open-
ing kick-off and after several
fakes returned the kick 55 yards
for a 6-0 Glee Club lead. which
they never relinquished.

Delray Gooch kicked a success-
ful two-point conversion for an 8-0
lead.

The Machine followed three
plays later with a 45 yard TD,
which was nullified because of an
offsides penalty.

The Men’s Glee Club took pos-
session of the ball on downs and
immediately connected on a long
pass from quarterback Jim Sheer
to John Dorsey on the one yard
line.

Jim Sheer passed to Tim Kavic
for the TD and a 14-0 lead. The
conversion attempt failed.

The Machine came rolling back

with a touchdown pass from Rich
Stanich to Jim Cauley to narrow

_ the margin to 14-6.

The Glee Club quickly got the
ball back and scored another TD
with only three minutes left in the
game. Tim Kavic scored this six-
pointer on another pass from Jim
Sheen.

A hangover can be just about the
most distressing combination of
pain, nausea, depression and fa-
tigue you ever woke up with.
Simple headache tablets or alka-
lizers alone can't do the‘whole
job. You need a combination of
special ingredients to chase those
multiple miseries. Formulated
specially for hangover. CHASER
combines nine ingredients in
everytablet.

So, pain disappears last. Your
stomach calms down. Your spir-
its perk up.

Try CHASER FOR HANGOVER.
It Really Works! Now at your
pharmacy.

 

In their last encounter, the
Mountaineers squeezed past the
booters, 1-0, last fall, scoring a
goal with two minutes left in the
match.

Bemis feels that his squad out-
played their opponents. and the
shot was a bad break.

West Virginia has been weak on
defense and employs a 3-4-3 align-
ment to compensate for their
weakness. The 3-4-3 gives them
better midfield control.

The soccermen are hoping for a
large turnout for the match. This
has been their first successful
season in several years as they
have maintained a 6-3 record and
have a chance at the NCAA play-
offs.

Bemis feels that his team has
improved over last year and can
succeed despite their opponents

Harriers Prime For

East’s IC4-A Meet

by MARTY HELLMAN

The cross-country team will conclude its abbreviated dual meet
schedule tomorrow afternoon at the Big Four Meet at Penn State lini-

versit_v.

So far this season. the harriers have picked up two wins against
Cleveland State and West Virgina. and placed fifth in the Notre Dame

Invitational.

The only races remaining after tomorrow will be the Eastern and
National Championships which will be run later in November.

This will be the first time that a
cross-country race has taken
place between the big four east-
ern powers, Pitt, Penn State,
West Virginia, and Syracuse. In
years past, the teams usually met
in only dual meets.

Pitt Coach Jim Banners har-
riers face the toughest competi-
tion from the Nittany Lions. Last
year. PSU downed them. 23-38.
and the Lions have only one race
this season. that being to a strong
Villanova squad.

"They are a well balanced
team.” commented Banner.
"The_v‘re always very strong. "

Included in the Lions seven re-
turning lettermen from last
years team. which finished tenth
in the nation. is junior Greg Fred-
ericks. During last year's track
season. he established himself as
States top runner.

“He is an excellent runner,"
said Banner. “He’ll probably be
the one that Jerry (Richeyl has
to beat for top spot.”

Richey. who has never lost to
Fredericks. regards him as a

threat because "he has continual

 

Attention — Students 8; Young Men

ly improved since he was in high
school."

Earlier this year. the harriers
swamped West Virginia. 19-49.
That was the only dual meet loss
that the Mountaineers suffered
this year.

Banner does not know much
about Syracuse except that “they
have two very strong runners but
not much to back them up.”

The course at Penn State is a
five-mile one which Banner de-
scribes as "a fairly average
course from the standpoint of
hills.“

_In the past two weeks the liar-
riers have been working out on the
outdoor track at the Stadium for
speed training.

Banner is taking 12 men to the
meet. This will be the final dual
meet for seniors Ricbey, Mike
Schurko, Greg Rodgers, Mark
Vornhagen and Mike Nolan.

l)ave Cheseborough. Dave S221-
bat. Bog Hagner. Ken Balke. John
Black. Ken Silay and Bill Harvey
will be the others making the trip.

This task for gaining support for such a game is next to im-
possible for one person. The problem is that most people would
like to see the game but none has the time and effort to see it
through. It is my hope that you can help this cause along by mak-
ing this petition available to your readers. I am asking the help of
all the major universities in the country.

Success would be attained by flooding Sports Illustrated
magazine with thousands of signatures supporting the enclosed
petition. This would undoubtedly cause them to bring the subject
to light and show the public and the NCAA the feelings of many
football fans in the country.
