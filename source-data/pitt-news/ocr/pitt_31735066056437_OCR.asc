B NCAA puts Pitt on two-years probation forviolations

By Brian Gallagher

Sports Editor

After nearly three years of intermittent

investigations, cross examinations and
speculation, the National Collegiate
Athletic Association inquiry into the
University of Pittsburgh athletic program
is over.

The Pitt athletic department received

two years probation for major rules vio-

lations in its men’s basketball program, 9

the NCAA Committee of Infractions
announced yesterday. In addition, -the
men’s football ‘program received minor
penalties for secondary infractions.

The penalties imposed on Pitt were
less than the minimum required by
NCAA doctrine because, according to the
12-page press release, the university
took “strong disciplinary action” and
reported most of the infractions on its

own volition.

‘fWe are grateful that the NCAA recog-
nized the good—faith effort by the univer-
sity,” Pitt Chancellor]. Dennis O’Connor
said. “Our investigation is unique
because of our effort. We plan to comply
fully.”

The a_nnouncement culminates an
investigative process that began Feb. 10
and 11, 1991, when two newspaper arti-
cles were written about alleged viola-

Throughout the Pitt campus today,
students will voice their opinions as
they vote for the 1994 Student
Government Board.

Last‘night’s SGB presidential debate
in the William Pitt Union’s Kurtzman
Room gave candidates one last chance

Questions regarding SGB’s ﬁnancial
management and sensitivity to campus
diversity dominated the two-hour
debate. '

Black Action Society Deputy Chair
Michael Barge asked each of the candi-
dates what steps they would take to

ensure diversity on the Pitt campus and .

what their opinions were on the idea of
an African cultural center. 9

diversityawareness and sensitivity
could help ensure it.

“Diversity is a very hard issue to
deﬁne,” Scerbo said. “We have to get as
many students as possible together
working on it.” ~

marketplace of ideas,” said hehas seen

The year 2000 is only a little
more then six years away, and
planning for what’Oakland
will look like is already under-
way. \

The Oakland 2000 Master
Space Plan task force is a
group of committees that met
at Schenley High School last
night to discuss concerns of
the community in university-
related projects. .

“These task forces have
been formed to get input for

:’i_-

the Master Space Plan and
assist the university and the
city of Pittsburgh in the devel-
opment of Oakland and the
university community,” said
Caroline Boyce, the executive
director of the Oakland
Planning and Development
Corporation.

The task force broke up into
seven groups, including one
on the newly proposed con-
vocation center, which will be
built near the Fitzgerald Field
House. .

The task force assigned to
the convocation center dis-

cussed the problems that
could arise for Oakland resi-
dents now that a site has been
named for the center.

Leslie Kaplan, the facilitator

for the convocation center _

taskforce said her committee
“will gather opinions and find
out the community impact of
the site location.” --
Kaplan said that most likely
the dental school and medical
schools at Pitt would have to
be taken down to make room
for the center. In addition to
that lengthy project, there
would be problems of traffic

and parking. According to
Kaplan, this is an area that
already is a major concern for
Pitt students and Oakland resi-
dents.

Kaplan also spoke of.the
beneﬁts that the convocation
center will bring to the com-
munity. “There has been an
explosion in intramural sports
at Pitt the last couple of years,
and this center will add to
Trees Hall and all the activities
that students and faculty can
do. 2

Responding to the published wrong-
doings, Pitt conducted a self-inquiry and
reported numerous rules violations to
the Infractions Committee in May of
1992. The NCAA, in response to the uni-
versity findings, conducted its own
investigation of Pitt. The penalties hand-
ed down to Pitt yesterday are in

Researchers
explore. new
treatments
for cancer

By Steve Kozarovich
Asst. News Editor

Pitt’s involvement in a national can-
cer study is another example of Pitt’s
strength and importance to the com-
munity, according to a principal inves-
tigator for the study.

“It’s important for students to realize
that this is not an isolated incident,”

Joel Weissfeld, assistant professor of
epidemiology and principal investiga-
tor for the study, said.

“Pitt has a good track record when it
comes to large community clinically
based studies.”

Weissfeld was referring to the
Pittsburgh Cancer Institute (PCI), a
coalition of several local universities
and hospitals, announcing Monday that
they are participating in'a national
study to determine the effectiveness of

various screening tests to detect can- *

cers of the prostate, lung, colorectum
and ovaries.

The Pittsburgh coalition is one of 10
medical institutions across the country
to receive funds from the National
Cancer Institute to participate in the
study. Others involved include the
University of Colorado, the University
of Minnesota and Georgetown
University. .

“This study will provide much-need-
ed data to help us "understand the ben-
efits and limitations of several cancer
screening tests, many of which have
been used routinely for years,”
Weissfeld said.

“We are very happy to have been
selected. This is a huge challenge
trying to deal with important ques-
tions.” . A

Currently, the scientiﬁc information is
inadequate for determining effective-
ness of these tests, according to NCI
spokesperson John Gohagan.

“As a result, opinions regarding their
usefumess vary greatly within the med-
ical community,” Gohagan said. “And,
because some tests have become more
widely used, the public is understand-
ably confused.”

PCI’s role in the study is to recruit,
randomize, screen and follow up on
patients in the study, Weissfeld said.

“But we will provide some scientiﬁc

endorses SGB candidates

By Robin Senor
Staﬁ’ Writer

We all have heard of the Yellow
Pages. The White pages. Picture
pages with Bill Cosby. Next week at
the University of Pittsburgh, howev-
er,.there will be a new set of pages
ﬂoating around campus. - something

called the Pride Pages. .

“Our newsletter, called Pride
Pages, will be out at the end of the

A week. We’ll be distributing the

newsletter to the William Pitt Union,
local Coffeehouses, the Litchfield
Towers’ lobbies — just so we can get
people who normally don’t come to
meetings,” said Sacha Layos, co-pres-
ident of the Bisexual, Gay and
Lesbian Alliance.

BiGALA will be publishing the A
‘newsletter to keep the- campus

informed of local activities as well to
serve as an outlet for feature articles.
Chrissy Koch, who is one of the
members of BiGALA organizing the
newsletter, said that anyone who
wanted to could contribute to the

lllen’sanrllIlumtn’s
  lllternatiue  
  Elnthinu 65111125

newsletter, and that its content

ranges from the history of the Gay,
Lesbian and Bisexual movement to
stories and poems submitted by stu-
dents. _ — 7

“It’s anything that people wanted
to write about that they think con-
cerns the gay community,” Koch
said. .

Something that members said they
think may concern the university
community as well as the gay com-

imunity is BiGALA’s announcement of

the student government board candi-
dates it will endorse for today’s elec-
tions. They are: Ross Pasquale for
president, Eric McKinley, Dave
Deiuliis, Gwin Grogan, Deena
Buchanan and Elizabeth Mania all for
Board. According to Layos, BiGALA
members filled out surveys to deter-
mine which candidates they felt

‘could best suit their needs as a

group.“We felt a lot of the candidates
were very good, so it was tough to
narrow the decision down to five,”
Business Manager Todd Kinavey
said.

For The Pitt News

The federal deficit will impose a huge problem
on today’s twenty-something generation by the time
they are forty—something, according to a National
Debt Public Awareness Group leader.

Sponsored by the University Democrats, Helen
Humphreys-Short spoke on behalf of The
Concord Coalition, a bipartisan organization found-
ed by U. S. Senators Paul T songas and Warren
Rudman. ’

The coalition’s main purpose is to raise public
awareness about the federal deficit and its potential
impact on America’s citizens. I

The organization is a “grass-roots, nonpartisan
and non-proﬁt” group which intends “to educate
people about the deficit” and make citizens aware

that they will “need to sacrifice a little to solve the ,

(deﬁcit) problem,” Humphreys-Short, the Western
Pennsylvania Director of The Concord Coalition
said.

Humphreys-Short said the deficit will impose a
huge financial burden on tiie twenty-something
generation by the time they’ turn forty—something.

Prostate, lung, colorectal and
ovarian cancers are responsible
for 48 percent of cancer deaths,
according to the Health

Sciences News Bureau.
This year 500,000 Americans

' will be diagnosed with these

cancers and 250,000 will

Budget

Continued from page 2
The Concord Coalition cites the
present Social Security System
and annual interest payments
included in the federal budget
as two factors which will greatly
increase taxes in years to come.

The ratio of workers to
retirees in 20 years will be two
to one, according to
Humphreys-Short.

Taxes will increase by 25 per-
cent in order to support the
massive inﬂux of social security
c'laims.

By the year 2000,. The
Concord Coalition projects that
social security will consume 22
percent of the entire federal
budget, she said.

Currently, the federal govern-
ment borrows one billion dol-
lars per day to support its pro-
grams, in addition to the money
it collects through federal

income tax. The interest on this
borrowed money accounts for
14 percent of the annual bud-
get. 0

Essentially, taxpayers are
helping to pay for the interest
on borrowed funds, and
according to Humphreys-Short,
“interest payments turn into
wasted money because they
don’t buy anything.”

The Concord Coalition is con-

‘ cemed about the future effects

of excessive government bor-
rowing, so it has drawn up a
“Zero Deficit Plan” which mem-
bers said they think can balance
the federal budget by the year
2000.

“Students should become‘ part
of the political process. The first
step in doing this is to write a
thoughtful letter to your repre-
sentatives,” said Humphreys-
Short.

said. “Anytime you go through
an investigation, it makes you
feel better when it’s over -
regardless of the outcome.”

Among the violations in both
the football and basketball pro-
grams, the most serious
occurred in the latter. Even if
there had been no infractions in
football (there were 15), the
basketball improprieties were
severe enough to call for the
two-year reprimand.

The basketball violations
include:

0 Recruitment incentives from

' an assistant basketball coach

and a representative of Pitt’s
athletic interest for a prospec-
tive student—atl1lete (believed to

be Jamal Faulkner) in the form
of $7,000 tuition payment at a
preparatory school, cash for
clothing, and offers of extra
beneﬁts.

0 Recruiting contacts by the
representative of the institu-
tion’s athletic interests.

0 Unethical conduct by an
assistant men’s basketball
coach.

0 The provision of a tele-
phone credit card to a student-
athlete’s mother to use to con-
tact the mothers of two
prospective student-athletes to
provide information to them
regarding the Pitt athletic pro-
gram. _ _

concerns were discussed at the
transportation task force section
of the meeting. The facilitator
for that division, Karen Levin,
assembled the members to
work on problems including
security as ‘related to transit,
how to get Pitt students and
Oakland residents to use alter-

1 nate modes of transportation

and how to better enforce traffic
regulations in Oakland.

Boyce opened the meeting by
discussing the “four products of
Oakland 2000 -—- valuable com-
munity input, written agree-
ments between local neighbor-

hoods and the University of
Pittsburgh, topics with the
Zoning Commission and the
creation of an updated Oakland
plan.” -She said that, overall, the
task force is helpful in “enhanc-
ing Oakland and the city of
Pittsburgh.”

Oakland 2000 was organized
last May to get groups and orga-
nizations like the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center
involved in the process of
updating Oakland. Besides the
convocation center and trans-
portation task forces, there are
sections that deal with bound-
aries, housing and employment.

Lack of ethics intolerable
A news release issued yesterday by the NCAA

If  _revealed that the University of Pittsburgh has been put

on probation “for two years for violations of NCAA leg-
islation in men’s basketball.” The Pitt football program

~ was also cited for violations of NCAA rules.

The violationsin basketball included unethical con-
duct by the assistant coach, giving athletes money for
- preparatory schools and clothes, giving telephone credit

if . ’ cards to an athlete’s mother and giving a meal to a

7prospective athlete’s high school coach, principal‘, and a
friend of the coach during a visit. The penalties include
a two-year probation, formal reprimand, a reduction in
the number of expense paid visits for the basketball
program, a reduction in the number of basketball schol-
arships the .university can give from 15 to twelve and
limiting recruiting activities. A - _

The football prograéin violated rules when they permit-

»  ted prospective players to “work out in the presence of

4

- a coaching staff member,” and “provided lodging “ and

“local transportation” for recruits. Limousine and “cloth-
ing items” were provided for several prospective players

‘ during a visit. Student hosts received large amounts of

money for student visits and recruits were given meals.
The football program received two-year’s probation and
was censured. The number of paid football recruiting
visits forthe 1995-94 or 1994-95 year was reduced to

' sixty. The Athletic Department must alsostart a compre-

hensive ‘educational program. These penalties are less
than the minimum required because Pitt conducted a
thorough investigation and reported the violations to
the NCAA. The university took “strong disciplinary
action” and the football violations were “secondary in
nature,” the report said. If the coaches involved were

' still here, Pitt would have faced harsher penalties. For

the next three years, the coach involved faces limita-
tions on his coaching responsibilities.
Even though most-of the coaches involved, are no
longer here, this must serve as a warning to the Pitt
Athletic Department. Unethical means should not be
used to increase the ability of Pitt’s teams. It is unfortu-
nate that those who weren't involved are must pay for
these violations, but the punishment does fit the crime.
Pitt should not be overly commended for investigating

’ and reporting its own violations because they simply

should not have been committed in- the first place. It is
only expected that when administrators were made
aware of misconduct, an in—house investigation would
be launched. This should serve as a warning that under-

' handed recruiting techniques‘ will not be tolerated by
the University. Although the individuals responsible are
paying the price, the University must be held account-
able. Pitt must keep this incident in mind as they recruit
people in the coming years.

What if someone were to tell
you that there might be a way

to put a-virtual end to the 20- I

year feud over abortion in a
fashion that pleases both sides?
Well, I think there may be a
way to begin resolving the
debate. However, implemen-
tating the pain will probably be
as controversial as the abortion
issue itself. d

What I am suggesting does
sound radical, but it’s actually
something that really should be
fairly commonsensical: Having
both sides talk to each other
and work things out. . .

Believe it or not, it’s already
happening. In June of last year
an article in- USA Today report-
ed that groups representing
both sides of the abortion issue
in St.‘ Louis, Dallas, and
Watertown, Mass., are now act-
ing on this suggestion.. One of
the Dallas sessions was even
tapeand aired. on a segment of
“60 Minutes.” The screaming
and sign-waving, long staples of
demonstrations, were nowhere
to be found.

I first considered the’ idea of
both sides talking to each other
about five years ago. I was a
member of a studio audience
for a now-defunct television

‘show, “Pittsburgh’s Talking,”
‘and that day’s debate centered

around Operation Rescue,

.which had just become active in

Pittsburgh.

Within 20 minutes of the start
of the show there would have
been a riot in the studio if the
two sides had not been strictly
segregated. (I already had con-
siderable knowledge of the
war, and I just shook my head.).

As it turned out, I talked to
the pro-choicers before_ the
show and the anti—abortionists
afterward, and I was probably
the only person in the entire
assembly who did that. It seems
that people who have disputes
don’t believe in talking them
out in a civilized manner and
that being right and more pow-
erful than their opponentis

, more important. ~

9 Another approach to abortion debate

For the record, with the
exception of a mother’s life
being-‘threatened, I do not
accept abortion for any reason:_

not rape, incest, fetal deformity
and certainly not as a method of
birth control or a “conve-
nience.” However, this view-
point is in the minority; 80 per-
cent of Americans, including 60
percent of registered

Rick N owlin

Republicans, favor Roe v.
Wade.

The two sides in the abortion
debate have more in common
than. they may think. Both are
concerned with the physical
and emotional health I of
women facing unplanned preg-
nancies, and both are interest-
ed in meeting'women’s needs.

Of the three options that the
pro-choice movement gives
women": abortion, adoption, or
raising the child;.anti-abortion-
ists can accept the latter two.
There is no reason why the two
sides can’t work together.

The attorney general of the
state of Missouri has helped
write the abortion restriction
law which later became the
Supreme Court decision
Webster v. Reproductive Health
Services. Yet, despite her oppo-
sition to abortion, she has
cooperated on at least three
occasions with the director of
the abotrion clinic involved in
the suit. ' I

There are those who would
say, “But we cannot compro-
mise our principles.” But princi-
ples left this debate when work-
ers began to be harassed, clinics
bombed and churches sued.

At this point, so much of the
public has been turned off by
the abortion debate that it really
isn’t an issue anymore in politi-
cal campaigns. If ignorant peo-
ple promote a cause, then the

cause is lost. To paraphrase the
late columnist Sydney Harris,
not only do the ends not justify
the means, but the means deter-
mine, and corrupt, the ends.

Both sides must put away
their red-hot rhetoric. It won’t
do for the pro-choice side to
accuse the anti-abortionists of
being misogynist religious big-
ots because much‘ of their lead-

ership is female.

Although much of the oppo-

sition to abortion is indeed

centered in churches, not all of

it is. The Village Voice’s Nat

Hentoff, who can be described
‘as a secular humanist, has spo-

ken out regularly against ab
ortion.

Conversely, anti-abortion
groups shouldn’t call their
opponents “Nazi baby-killers."
The truth be told, a number of
pro-choice advocates would not
have an abortion themselves or
recommend anyone else to do
so; they just don’t believe that
the law should restrict a wom-
an‘s access to abortion. It
should also be mentioned that
Hitler was against abortion.

Each side has also made the
mistake of isolating the issue of
abortion from other social prob-
lems. Rarely have things such as

poverty been considered as

contributing factors.

The anti-abortionists should
look for ways to create a cli-
mate in which social justice can
take root and thrive. On the
other hand, the pro-choicers,
should talk about responsible
sexuality.

Soon after the TV show, I ran
into one of the panelists, Janet
Catov of the National Abortion
Rights Action League. I told herI
opposed abortion, and she
responded, “but you were rea-
sonable!” I took that as a com-
pliment, because she felt com-
fortable enough to talk to me
about her concerns. Talking to
each other ‘might help to solve
problems. Lord knows the other
way hasn’t worked.

Marathon Oil bombards Pitt, 98-80

I Byjason Brame

Asst. Sports Editor

For their first pre-season exhibition
game of the season, the Pitt Panthers
‘looked more the part of the travel-weary
journeymen than did their former col-
lege-level opposition.

Marathon Oil, normally the
Washington Generals of college exhibi-
tion basketball, threw down over 51 per-
cent of their three—pointers'as their
perimeter game helped bury the
Panthers, 98-80 before 3,161 at Fitzgerald
Field House last night. , g
I “We tried to pick up our intensity
through the game, but they just had a
great shooting night,” Pitt small forward
Orlando Antigua said. "If they would
have missed. a couple of more threes
then we could have pulled away,‘ but
they just made their shots 

 While the Panthers did not. Pitt,
who shufﬂed rookies and veterans in a
make—shift lineup, shot only 34.9 percent
in the contest.

Because of injuries to guards Jerry
McCullough and Garrick: Thomas, Pitt
head coach Paul Evans ran out a starting
lineup that was just two—fifths reminis-
cent of last season’s. Only center Eric
Mobley and point-guard Ahmad Shareef
— who normally plays two—guard and
moved over from the point to spell
McCullough —— jumped off the bench for
pre—game intros.

“We have so may new. kids it’s tough
when we haven’t played together very
much,” Evans said.

“With the offense it was a little bit dif-
ferent because we were playing with a
couple _of guys who were new,” Mobley
said. “I don’t think they were really
‘accustomed to knowing where I like the
ball at, but that just comeswith time
because that was the first time that we
ever played together with referees.”

True freshman Sotiris Aggelou (10
points), who started at off—guard in his
first game as a Panther, joined fellow
newcomers Jaime Peterson and highly-

their Pitt debuts. I

“I thought there were some jitters out
there tonight,” Evans said. “Sotiris had

some jitters; he would hesitate with his

shot, and get it blocked. He took some
nice shots, though.”

Mobley starred for the Panthers, notch-
ing 26 points and pulling down 17

boards to pace a strong Pitt front court.
Forward Chris Gant grabbed 13
rebounds while Antigua recorded nine
points and seven rebounds.

Marathon Oil was led by guard Fred
Colefield, who scored 28 points. Forward
Chad Tucker was six of seven from
three-point land for 21 points, while
Todd May scored 17 points while pulling
down a team—high nineboards.

What made the Carnegies and the
Mellons of the world so rich? What
made Michael Jordan so dominant in
the star—studded NBA?

The same key ingredient that sopho-
more Aaron Fortner possesses to
become the best at what he does -
swimming.

The ingredient that separates the men
from the boys: drive. _

The drive to become the best. To
realize one’s talents and not be satisfied
with it, to keep pushing and working
harder to improve. To set goals for one-
self and once achieved, set higher ones.
That is the ingredient that separates
Fortner from the rest.

“Aaron works very hard and is very
dedicated to the sport,” men’s swim-
ming assistant coach David Amato said.
“He is very goal-oriented. He knows
what he wants and goes and gets it. He
is a good example for the rest of the
swimmers.” ,

“I know what its takes to get where I

x,_

Fortner added. “It’s not tough to work
hard. Swimming comes naturally to me.
That’s not hard to me. It’s getting sleep,
getting rest, eating right, practicing hard

every day — the little stuff.”

Fortner’s work ethic is essential to his
success, but he would be nowhere
without his raw ability. The Florida
native was state champ in the 100 but-
terﬂy and was on the All-State Team.

“Aaron is a very talented swimmer,”
Amato said. “He has top- 10 national
class upper—body strength. His stroke
keeps getting finer and finer.”

As a toprecruit, he was sought after
by top schools like LSU, Florida State,
and Kentucky, but chose Pitt.

“I felt that this was a program on the
rise, and I thought that I could play a
big part in it,” Fortner said. “We weren’t
that good last year, but sure enough
we’re real good this year.”

Fortner’s intuition was right on the
money. The men’s swim team is cur-
rently undefeated and is eagerly await-
ing the polls to come out on Thursday
to see what number they are ranked
after upsetting a top 15 Virginia squad.

.. -rv-~
.l.l.»‘

who is ranked in the top ten in the
country  I think we could go unde-
feated this year,” Fortner added.

With Fortner swimming the 100- and
200-yard butterﬂy and_.freestyle, Pitt’s
swim team has a good chance of mak-
ing a prophet out of Fortner.

As a first—year student, Fortner‘ had to
adjust to the college-level distance of
meets, which is double from what he
was used to swimming. Since then,
Aaron has adjusted just fine.

“He has gained a lot of confidence
and a lot of ability in his national racing
strategy for the 200 race,” Amato said.
“That has been very valuable. He feels
real conﬁdent in the 200 distance now.”

Conﬁdence is something Fortner has a
lot of, but don’t get confidence con-
fused with cockiness — the exact oppo-
site of‘ Fortner’s personality.

“I think this year I’m going to do real-
ly well. At the meet this Sunday I think
I’ll‘ do really well. At the Big East
Championships in February I think I’ll
do really well, and hopefully I’ll make
the national championships this year,”
Fortner said. “This year will be good
and every‘ year will get better.” A

juco transfer Cauley out to make most of opportunity

Brady Slater
Staff Writer

(First of a two—part story on
Pitt newcomer Willie Cauley.)

He lives alone in a small,
scantily furnished, immaculate
apartment. There are no hall-
ways. The bedroom runs into
the living room which runs into
the kitchen which runs into the
bathroom. It’s like a motel
room.

And for this 6-foot-7-inch,
249-pound man, it may as well
be one. He hopes this is not a
destination, but a stop on a
longer journey.

“Now I’m here and I got to
prove myself here,” the 21-
year—old said. “I’m coming, I’m
rising up, I want to make it to
the show. I’ve only got two
years, two hard, long years.” -

For Willie Cauley, a junior
college transfer who is begin-
ning his stint with the Pitt bas-
ketball team this season, this a
short stop that he has been
waiting a long time for.

Cauley was born and raised
in Niagara Falls, N.Y. Willie and
Berenda Barber had Cauley
and his older sister, Berendella,
before they were married. After
they wed, Cau1ey’s brother
Ulysses was born.

Cauley says he was a hood-
lum when he was growing up
— always in trouble — but he
says with a laugh that it was,
“just trouble, you know little
things that you do in high
school, kidsdo in high school.
I was the one.’.’ "

 He picked up a basketball for
the first time when, at 6—feet-4-
inches, a skinny Cauley went

In her remarkable best-selling novel ‘
The Fountainhead, Ayn Rand champions
a philosophy of rational egoism.

This revolutionary philosophy holds that
, reason is each man's only proper guide for
action, and his only proper goal should be
his own personal happiness.

Dr. Bernstein, Associate Professor of
Philosophy at Pace University, will discuss
how The Fountainhead—with its theme of

independence in thought and action—,
concretizes and dramatizes Objectivism,
Any Rand's philosophy of rational egoism.

“I sucked. I wasn’t interested

said. —

But he acquired an interest,

eighth and ninth grade all he
did was play basketball.

“That one summer, it just

He finished his high school

Cauley signed with
Duquesne out of high school.
But knowing he would be a
Proposition 48 casualty, he
decided to «go to Dodge City
junior college in Kansas.

“I’d rather get 60 games than
to go sit out for a year,” he

out of his Fruit of the Looms
into a statuesque upper body,

his bigger frame.

fat on you,” he said. “You
butcher a cow and eat straight
cow.” ,

“In the system I ran, fives

guys were in double figures,”
said Cauley’s coach at Dodge
City Brad Underwood, now a
coach at Western Illinois. “He
was the best JUCO player in
the country,” Underwood said.

Cauley got along with
Underwood. He called him his
“foster parent.”

“My senior year in high
school, I could play anywhere,”
he said. “When I went to
Kansas they just stayed with my
game  Shooting. -Scoring. I
was consideredone of‘ the best
at one time. Me and this kid
James Scott were in the race for
it and then I left school.”

Rather he was kicked out. ,

The trouble the self-proclaimed
hoodlum had found in high
school  found him in college.

Last January, Cauley was

kickedzut of Dodge City. He
admits that he drove the car
after his teammate took a case
of beer from a convenience
store. But he says that the girl
behind the counter, who they
both knew, told his teammate
to go get the beer.

“And wheniwe leave she
changes her mind,” he said. “I
told my teammate, I’m not dri-
ving back up there so you can
take it back. So then she called
the police. It was childish.”

Cauley was never charged
with shoplifting. But the inci-
dent was a last-straw. Earlier in
his Dodge City career he had
been arrested by an undercover
police officer because the offi-
cer said Cauley was knocking
around Stein [Marlene]. He was
charged with assault.

Underwood said. Stein was

“ﬂabbergasted, because nothing
happened.” And according to
Underwood five of’ Cauley’s

teammates were there when he '

was arrested and all of them
said nothing happened. The

charges were later dropped -

due to lack of evidence.
“Dodge City is the cowboy

capital of the world,” said-

Underwood. “For a black stu-
dent athlete it’s like getting
thrown into a spotlight. He’s a
very good kid.He’s sincere and
kindhearted  he’s the only
player I had in five years to get
me and my wife a Christmas
card.”

After he was dismissed from
Dodge City, Cauley went home
and attended Finger Lakes
Community College in NY for
the second half of last year. He
didn’t play basketball there. -

Debate

Continuedfrom page 1 _
“People are afraid to discuss diversi-
ty issues and try new ideas,” he said.
Candidate Ross Pasquale said the

I best way to ensure diversity is to main‘-

tain it. 4

“We already have the diverse stu-
dent body, but we’re unable to keep it
 the rate of retention for black stu-
dents on this campus is only 35 per-
cent, and no one should settle for
that,” he said.

Pasquale also said that Pitt functions
as a “white cultural center” and would
beneﬁt -by the founding of an African
cultural center.

“It would make the university a
more renowned place, putting Pitt up
there with Yale and the University of
California at Berkeley which have very
reputable programs.”

Candidate Tara Munkatchy, who
defined diversity as “well-balanced”
said she would support the proposed
African cultural center. '

‘‘I’m definitely for it,” Munkatchy
said. “I’m behind any organization
which has that solid of a proposal.”

-Shira Hasson, president of Campus
Women’s Organization, asked the can-
didates how SGB plans to work with
students to create a Women’s Studies
major when the Women’s Studies
department has no funding.

Munkatchy, - the head -of the
Committee for a. Women’s Studies
Major, said, she is currently working on
how to fundthe program. “We’re tak-
ing it step bystep,” she said. '

Pasquale said the program should
not be set up entirely by students. “I

don’t think undergraduates are quali-
ﬁed to initiate a major,” he said. “We

have faculty that are
lqualiﬁed]...they’re the ones that need
to do the thinking.” ’

Scerbo said CWO should have been
told of any plans before the planning
began.

. “First thing, I would have ‘turned to
CWO,” he said. “I want to go to the
logical sources.”

Candidate Joe Foner also expressed
a need to involve CWO’s output in the
program’s planning.

“We have to consult with CWO to
"see that [their] needs are being repre-
sented,” he said. -

The Pitt News Editor in Chief Julie
Sabol asked the candidates what they
felt was the purpose of- the SGB
reserve fund and if they felt the spend-
ing of $5,000 from the reserve fund for
the clock on the WPU lawn was neces-
sary. V ‘

“I think the reserve fund should be
used for emergencies,” Foner said.

“As far as the clock goes...it is nice
to look at but I think it would have _
been better if we asked students first.”
he said.

Scerbo also said the reserve fund
should be used for emergencies, par-

ticularly those which concern students

directly.

-“Most importantly, all the money is
for us as students. That is where all the
money should go,” Scerbo said.

Pasquale said the fund could also be
used for funding of student organiza-
tions.

“I’ve been hearing a lot about the

possibility of the student activities fee
increasing, and I find that to be
absolutely ridiculous,” Pasquale
said. “I think the money should be
redistributed so it beneﬁts the student
body.”

Munkatchy said the reserve fund
could be re-allocated to complete pro-
jects which need extra money. She
also defended the purchase of the
clock. 77'

“We needed a clock very badly,” she
said.

Current SGB board member and
president _ pro tempore Ted Schroeder
asked the candidates what they felt
was the greatest problem between stu-
dents and the university administration
and how they would plan to solve that
problem.

Munkatchy said lack of communica-
tion is the biggest conﬂict between
students and administration.

“We need a qualiﬁed candidate who
has worked with upper-level adminis-
tration and knows how to improve
this,” she said.

f‘Communication is the root cause of
every issue,” candidate Douglas
Herman said. “It’s what it all comes
down to.”

Pasquale said the SGB must know
what students’ concerns are before
they attempt to solve them.

“Many problems are not large and

cannot be thrown together under one i

category,’1_ Pasquale said. “SGB is not
always informed about students’
everyday problems. -
“Students should take advantage 0
opportunities that exist,” he added.

- The provision of a meal to a
prospective student-athlete’s ‘high school
coach, principal, and friend during a
recruiting visit. _

Pitt head basketball coach. Paul Evans
would not comment on the sanctions,
saying “the President [of the university]
spoke for_ the university and on behalf of
the athletic department.”

All rules violations occurred during
Evans’ tenure at Pitt. As far as the football
side of the investigation, all irnproprieties
were found to be of a secondary nature.

The infractions occurred under the
auspice of former athletic director Ed
Bozik and former head football coach
Mike Gottfried between March 1986 and
February 1990. ‘

The football violations:

0 The provision of meals by an assis-
tant coach to student-athletes.

0 The provision of excessive entertain-
ment money to two student-athlete hosts
for ofﬁcial paid visits.

0 The provision of lodging prospective
student-athletes.

0 The provision of limousine service
and clothing for several student-athletes
and a prospect during an official paid
visit.

Jaynes said that no decision has been
made by current head football coach
Johnny Majors on in which recruiting
year Pitt limit its paid visits to 60. “It’s
been given to coach Majors and dis-
cussed, but nothing has been settled as
of now,” Jaynes said.
