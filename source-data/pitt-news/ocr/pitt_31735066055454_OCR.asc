Communications
profs honored

By Christie Black

 For The Pitt News

Three Pitt professors were recently honored at

 the convention of The National Speech
 Communication Association in San Antonio,
3 Texas. The association meets yearly to conduct
 workshops, conferences, debates and presentations
§ for research in the ﬁeld. Jack Daniel, Theodore O.
 Windt Jr. and'John Poulakos were recognized for

their work and achievements in communications.
Daniel and Windt were highlighted in the

Spotlight on Scholarship program, which honors V

the life work of an individual in the association.

Daniel became the first chairman of Black 1

Studies at Pitt in l969.‘He has held many diﬂerent

positions throughout the years. Currently he is an.

associate professor, and he was recently promoted
to vice provost of academic affairs. He also found-
ed the Black Caucus within the National Speech
Communication Association.

His research targets African Americans in
rhetoric and the mass media. Daniel released a
book at the convention entitled “FLA Black
Caucus, Changing Players in the Game.”

“I am most proud of my students, of which I
have had two types,” he said, “undergraduates
who have gone on to successful careers in many
ﬁelds, and graduate students who have become
members of the profession at many universities.”

Windt, a professor of politzical-rlietoric and chair’-'

man of the Department of Communication, was
also recognized in the Spotlight Program for his
life-time accomplishments. Wmdt’s work has been
reﬂected in his books “Presidential Rhetoric” and
“Presidents and Protesters: Political Rhetoric in the
1960s.” He has also written essays which have
appeared in journals such as Presidential Studies
Quarterly. Windt was also honored at Pitt with the

Chancellor’s Distinguished Teaching Award in

1986.

John Poulakos, associate professor of rhetoric,
won the 1995 James A. Winans-Herbert A.
Wichelns Memorial Award for Distinguished
Scholarship in Rhetoric. The Speech
Communication Association presented this award
to Poulakos for his book entitled “Sophistical
Rhetoric in Classical Greece.”

“Awards do not simply recognize one’s contri-
bution to scholarship,” Poulakos ‘said. “but they
also, and perhaps most importantly, constitute an
obligation for exceeding qualitatively the work
aheady done.”

Poulakos is currently working on his next book.
entitled “Discussion of the Conﬂict of Philosophy
and Rhetoric in Greek Culture.”

Theatre celebrates Black History with play

By Jennifer Alpha
Staff Writer

As the only three minority students
entering Pitt’s MFA acting program last
fall, KenYatta Rogers, Michelle Proctor
and Kashi Johnson set a collective goal.
Before leavingthe program, they would
do a play that commemorated African-
American culture. '

A year and a half later, after many
struggles to get the play approved and
searches to find a director, the trio has
reached the beginning of the end of its
joumey._ '

The Pitt Theatreproduction of “The
Colored Museum,” a play by George C.
Wolfe, opens tomorrow night at the

Studio Theatre in time for the celebration

of Black History Month. The production,
featuring an entirely African—American
cast, celebrates the roots of African-
American culture through 11 “exhibits,”
or mini-plays. Among them, “Cookin’
_ With Aunt Ethel” looks at the “Aunt
Jemima” stereotypical image, and “The
Last Mama-On-The—Couch-Play” tears
apart Lorraine‘ Hansberry’s “A Raisin in
the Sun” with humor and satire, explained
‘Brian Carney, dramaturge and assistant
director. V _
' “We wanted to do one black play before
we left,-” said "Michelle Proctor, who.
along with Rogers, had seen productions
of “The Colored Museum” in the past.
The two also went to historically African-
American schools as undergraduates,

Proctor said, they and know the impor-

9

tance of presenting plays that focus on
African-American-culture.

Johnson, however, went to Lehigh
University, where she said no productions

were done that-focused on minority‘

issues. _
“It’s important for them to see and
know that African Americans are in the

. theater program and that the department

does do these productions,” she said.

The play first had to be approved by the I

theater department’s selection committee.
which eventually agreed to have the play
be produced as a workshop production.
(Pitt Theatre has three categories of pro-
ductions -— mainstages, workshops and
labs — each lessening in budget and size
of production.)

The Pitt News, Thursday, February 22, 1996

Study abroad —— what do
these words mean to you? To
me, they signify the experi-
ence of a lifetime; they sym-
bolize the opportunity not
only to learn about a foreign
people and their culture, but
to live it; they represent the
best way to learn about your-
self, your goals, values and
beliefs.

To me, study abroad
means change in one’s life,
be it big or small.

My life was significantly
changed by my study abroad
experience. I was forced to
evaluate where I was in my
life and in what direction I
wanted to continue. _ ,

While many people learn

abroad, there are some who

unsure of their direction. This
confusion does not carry with
it negative consequences,
however. It is positive in the
sense that it leads to the ques-
tioning (or the affirmation) of
your personal philosophies,
values and beliefs, along with
those of your native country.

of their life’s direction’

become more confused and

Studying abroad a
rewarding experien cei

By taking a closer look at
your native country, you can
get a fresh outlook on your
own culture as comparedto
others. The question of how
two cultures can be so differ-
ent leads to the realization of
how those same two cultures
are so much alike.

' While culture changes
with time, human nature
stays the same. No matter
where you are across the
globe, people laugh, love,
hope, need, hurt, _cry and fear.
Studying abroad puts you in
touch with that reality. It
allows you to have a global
perspective. It makes you
aware that life exists outside
Pitt, where learning is often
confined to the classroom. It
takes you beyond classrooms,
beyond borders and time
zones, and beyond all bound-
aries of your "imagination.

Workshops, however, are usually proposed by
Ph.D; students who wish to direct the produc-
tion, not by a group of actors. This, along with
the technical challenges of perfecting many
sound cues on a small production crew, made
the selection committee hesitant. But the sup-
port of many of the faculty in the department,

‘ including Chair W. Stephen Coleman, helped

the three to get things up and running, said
Proctor and Johnson.

“If you are an American or you are born in

production has continued to grow.

“People really want to see this show suc-
ceed,” Johnson said. “It’s amazing that the
excitement can still be here after so many twists
and problems.”

While assaulting the stereotypes of the
African-American culture, the play also cele-
brates the archetypal figures of its history as
well. '

“Every stereotype has some basis of truth,”
Proctor said, “but just because it has some basis
of truth doesn’t mean that’s all there is. This is a
part of us, but this is not all of us.”

The stereotypical representations in the play,
high on comedy and satire, may not prove

“Some people love it; some people hate it —

The Pitt‘ News, Thursday, February 22, 1996

°From page 1

Beepers all over the emergency room went off,
alerting members of the trauma team to converge
at trauma room 27.

“Does anybody know what it is?” asked one. of
the residents as he pulled on a disposable gown.

“A possible femur fracture,” responded the ’_

social worker, who would soon be asking para-

medics about the identity of the patient. “MVA if

[moving vehicle accident].” .

“Where’s the trauma nurse?” asked Miller as she 
walked away from the nurse’s station. By now, 5

about seven people had gathered outside the trau— jg
ma room. “Everything would be fine if we had the

trauma nurse.”

Nurse’s aides and x—ray technicians smoothly
stepped in to perform their tasks. Others stood by,
waiting for their time to advance the ﬂow of the
structured system.

Paramedics rolled the patient in on a stretcher at
an easy pace into the trauma room. The young
man, who had just been in an accident, was con-
scious and quiet. Members of the trauma team sur-
rounded him as they began their assessment. “Got
a radial pulse,” someone said, just as the curtains
slid closed.

Working the ER

You never know what might roll through the
doors of the ER. This rainy morning had slicked
the roads during morning nish hour,
but the ER was virtually empty as
the staff milled around and quietly
did their jobs. Employees in the ER
say that the times you’d most
expect disaster can sometimes be
the most quiet, with ‘the exception
that New Year’s Eve usually fulﬁlls
everyon_e’s dismal expectations. But
certain traumas, like gunshot
wounds, can be counted on pretty

much every weekend.

That means the people who fill
the various positions that. make up
the ER staff have to be prepared for
anything at anytime. Nurse Marlene
Miller said that’s the part of the job
that is the most attractive to her.

“It just takes a certain personality
to like that non-routine atmos-
phere,” Miller said.

Still, doctors often refer to what
they call the “l0—year burnout.”

“It’s so high-paced and you’re
constantly barraged with things,”
says Dr. Valerie Donaldson, an
attending ER physician. Donaldson

_ has worked in the ER for six years.
She said many physicians move up
to administrative positions after 10
years. Donaldson recently opened a
coffee shop and has five children
and said she believes the time she
spends in these activities has served
as an outlet from medicine.

She did, though, recently visit

classes to talk to the children about
her job. One of the children recently
sent her a thank-you note for telling
the class about the most gruesome
thing she’d ever seen. She had told

the class that it was a man who had been hit by a train.

Coordination
Some of the well-orchestrated preparation of the emergency depart-
ment takes place beyond its hallways. In a dimly lit room, communi-

cations specialists who work for the Center of Emergency Medicine

talk to different ambulance services and coordinate the dispatch of
ambulances and helicopters.

Two communications specialists sit in front of screens and blinking
lights, talking into headsets. A map drapes the wall behind them,
plotting latitudes and longitudes so the communications specialists
can give landing coordinates to helicopters.

Paul Cornell turns up a med charmel and talks about how commu-
nications specialists hook up ambulance crews with a physician who
can give medical direction. The crew contacts communications. Then
the specialist assigns it a doctor and a channel and stands by in case
the channel isn’t clear.

“We make sure the ﬂow is there,” Cornell said, “that both parties
can copy each other.” -

All emergency calls go initially to the 911 Center. The center then
ﬁelds the calls to EMS or to the ﬁre department or police. When a
call comes into the Presbyterian University Hospital ER, the commu-
nications specialists make sure that everybody who needs to be noti-
ﬁed gets notiﬁed. Each trauma is classiﬁed as eitherl or H. A trauma

I is the most serious and life-
threatening.

Minutes after a specialist
received a trauma II call, notiﬁ-
cation went to the ER, where
Miller stood listening intently to
the call in the nurse’s station.
This set the trauma team into
motion.

The volunteering life

Volunteers in the ER range
from doctors and lawyers to
EMTs and students involved in
social work. Student volunteers
are mostly responsible to serve
as liaisons between friends and
family members of patients and
the people who are treating the
patient. ~

Often that involves talking to
an elderly man just about to lose
his wife about how they met and
fell in love. Sometimes it means
letting family members know
how much longer they’ll have to
wait to talk to-the doctor.

“People that volunteer in the
ER are here for different reasons
than people in the OR,” said Pat
McArdle, who trains volunteers
in the OR. Usually volunteers in
the OR are more interested in
the science of medicine, whereas
in the ER, many must learn how
to be able to calm a person down
or keep up a conversation with
strangers.. -

“It’s a little bit like a social _

worker,” McArdle says. “It
might be three hours before they
ﬁnd out what’s wrong with the
patient, get a CT scan, get blood
tests.”

But sometimes volunteers wit-

' ness tense scenes in the waiting

room. When there’s a gang-
related shooting, someone might
try to get past security to ﬁnish
the job.

One volunteer said that she
enjoys watching the ﬁnely tuned
mechanisms of the ER response
to disaster.

Last month, many of the
injured from the bus accident
came to Presby.

“Everybody kicked into high
gear,” she says. “Everybody
knows their jo .” _

Volunteering spots in the ER
are limited, but new volunteers
are taken every semester. To ﬁnd
out more about volunteering,

Shady investigation

If you were anywhere near a television or a newspaper a few weeks
ago, you had to have heard about the accusations directed toward Judge
Jeffery Manning. In case you are one of the lucky ones who was some-
how immune to the media circus, let us explain.

Seven witnesses claim that when a black woman who worked at the
Pittsburgh International Airport accidentally ripped his luggage, Judge
Manning said, ‘‘That’s what happens when you give a fucking nigger a
job.”

As soon as the incident happened, the media’s quest for sensational-
ized news was fulﬁlled. The ﬁrst two sound bites regarding the incident
(advertising the “Exclusive Storyl”) played the clip of the employee
repeating what she claimed the judge said. The actual news “story”
showed a room of the ﬁve witnesses, each of whom were asked to say
what they had heard. When two of the witnesses were hesitant to repeat
the exact words, the newscaster prodded and pushed until everyone had
oﬁicially repeated the offensive words live, on television. Thanks, Eye-
Team, but next time try to ﬁnd an actual story angle to discuss instead of
seeing how many times you can air the word “nigger” before someone
gets really upset. ‘

Aside from the ridiculous news coverage of what happened, there is
another very questionable aspect of the Manning incident. After the
incident was reported, an investigation took place to determine exactly
what happened.

The report that came back Tuesday stated that there was no conclu-
sive proof of any wrongdoing on the judge’s part and that there had
been no cover-up. The investigators said the witnesses’ stories regarding
the incident differ from each other, speciﬁcally regarding the position of
a police officer (who should have heard the slur if he was where the wit-
nesses claim he was). '

Though the investigation found nothing wrong, that process itself
should be questioned. The investigation into the incident was done by
county employees who have to deal with Judge Manning on an every-
day basis in his courtroom. There was no attempt made to hire aninde-
pendent, outside investigator who had no ties to either party in the argu-
ment. Also, an airport security video which would have caught the inci-
dent on frlrn has mysteriously disappeared, and when investigators were
asked about it, the only response was that they were not allowed, under
FAA regulations, to discuss the matter since it involved airport security.

Though the Eye-Team’s “investigation” of this matter was beyond
sensationalized, there does need to be an independent inquiry into
whether or not the accusations against Manning are true. As a judge,
Manning has to be impartial in his decisions. If he did say what he is
accused of saying, then there is a very real question raised his about
ability to ignore personal biases on the job.

Of course, everyone is innocent until proven guilty, as Judge
Manning well knows. But unless there is an honest, unconupt effort to
prove innocence or guilt, we’ll never know who is sitting in judgement.

Where's the hidden cookie jar?

The poor, downtrodden
Student Government Board
needs’ $15,000 worth of com-
puter equipment in its office.
So how does it get what it
wants? SGB gets it by taking it
out of the Student Activities
Fee. Basically, its budget is not
enough for its “-need” for new
computers. Personally, I share
my computers with the rest of
the campus and don’t enjoy the
privilege of my own office and
the attendant perks of an appar-
ently unlimited budget for per-
sonal computers. It should be
noted at this time that I steal
the computer time at The Pitt
News to spread my humor in
these columns.

For those of you who are lost
at this point, let me explain
how the process works (for my
more bloodthirsty readers, this
is the part where I tell you how
they’re_ screwing us). The
Student Government Board
president, Andrew Wuertele,
has announced a need for .the
SGB to purchase _ $14,663
worth of computers for its busy
little business of governing us.
Basically the members wanted
a computer on which they
could create a World Wide
Web page (for the good of the
students, of course).

The SGB submitted its
request through the usual chan-
nels (to wit: the Student

t Allocations Committee) and

was__turned down. The Student
Allocations Committee

Committee’s recommendation
of “NO!”.Is it just me, or is
there something really wrong
here?

The much ballyhoo-ed
Student Allocations Committee
works for SGB, and it has no
power whatsoever over who
gets the cash. It only makes
recommendations, and if SGB
wants to ignore them, it can ..'.
and has. President Andy
Wuertele should not be
applauded, lauded or respected
in any way for sticking his
hand, in the cookie jar in this
manner. Wuertele claims the
moral high ground for finger-
ing this cash before summer

' session, “when no one was

really around  we chose to be
up front.” Up front? Just anoth-
er stand-up guy making the
tough calls? Guess Andrew
paid attention in Presidential
Rhetoric 101. (By the way,
that’s a great class for anyone
who thinks politicians mean
what their speechwriters write.)

Why can’t the SGB ask for
this money in next year’s bud-
get or even take it out of its
office overhead? Can SGB
members-not, walk over to the
nearest computer lab and make
a World Wide Web page? We
need these computers in the

SGB office for what? Playing '

Mortal Kombat and surfrn’ the
Net? Andy, could it be that you
don’t want to have to wait: for

your "toys ‘til next budget?
__ What, other emergencies loom

a “cpmp_ar_1y car”. in our future

‘ or perhaps office renovations

with a,bette_r view? We know
how stressful these tough calls
can be. " " ' _ 0

The truly sickening part of

this twisted tale of incestuous

cash hogging is the fact that
these funds were requested

from outside the SGB’s

approved budget. Through a
little known process of an

through the General
Distribution Pool (read: money
from last semester’s budget as
yet unspent — approximately
worth $75-90,000), the SGB
has funnelled off even more
funds for itself and its office
staff. SGB was told that its

request never met the criteria '

for the money to begin with;
yet it asked again. It was only
going through the motions
because it KNEW it was going
to give itself the money. The
SGB secretary, office space,
work—study interns, computers

and (in Wuertele’s case) tuition

are paid for out of your Student
Activities Fee. Nevertheless
the carrion eaters seem not to
be bloated enough on your
hard-borrowed cash yet.

It is interesting to note that
the SAC would have had one
of the four computers installed
in its office yet it showed the
fortitude to just say no to
SGB’s money grab for toys.

(My more cynical readers will 7

no doubt notice, as I do, that

SAC gets a new computer now _

anyway.) Does the SGB’s sec-
retary really need a new com-
puter? Does SGB need three
additional new computers? I
DON’TTHINK S0! The fact
that it claims not to be taking
money from anyone else is not

_ The arctic air is warming.

The sun is out. Very soon,

Very soon, it will be baseball

is actually an exciting prospect.

Part of the beauty of spring

the same shot at the pennant.
Every town has the chance to

It isn’t too hard to see why,

Look at the spring training

probably calls by number. Take
a quick glimpse by position.

Providence routs Lady Panthers, 90-63

Pih‘ breaks

team record for
losses with 27

 

By Ned Schano
Staff Writer

The only team slipping faster than Pitt’s men’s basketball team is the women’s
team. Last night, the Lady Panther’s suffered their 21st loss of the season, 90-63 at the
hands of the Providence Lady Friars.

The Lady Panthers had few bright spots as they shot a dismal 39% from the ﬁeld
compared to Providence’s 50%. _
' Pitt managed to hang tough with Providence during the
 ﬁrst eight minutes. Four points each by Julie Fomadel and
 Kelly Senneca kept the Lady Panthers close.

‘ Following JoJo Guzman’s l0-foot jumper at 9:45 in the
ﬁrst half, the Lady Panther’s tied Providence 16-16.

That shot provedto be the closest Pitt would get the rest of
the game. With 4:05 left in the ﬁrst half, Providence’s lead
was extended to 10 points following two of Mandy Saunders
I 21 points. _

By the end of the ﬁrsthalf, the Lady Friars lead had bal-
looned to 16 points. »

The Lady Panther’s uninspired play in the last four minutes
of the half seemed to take the wind out.of their sails.

Following a Friar lead of 19 early in the second half, the

  
  
 
 
 
 
 
   
 
  
  
 
 
   
  
 
  
 
 
  
 
  
  
  
 

lowing successive three pointers by Gina Montesano and
  Guzman. ‘ '
' Pitt looked like it was trying making a run and make the
game interesting. _
g -The Lady Friars used the Panther run as ammunition, how-
ever, as they pummeled the Lady Panthers for the ﬁnal 15
minutes of play. ' '

Nadine Malcolm fueled theLady Friars stretch drive, scor-
, ing 20 of her game-high 27 points in the second half.
 Malcolm also added 11 rebounds. '
 Latia Howard continued her year-long strong inside play as

 she lead the Lady Panther’s with 15 points and eight '

 rebounds. Freshman guard Gina Montesano was the only

.: other Pitt player in double ﬁgures with 10 points.

 The- win improved Providence’s record to ll-l4, 8-9 in the
Big East. The loss dropped the Panther’s to 4-21 with a 3-13

4 conference record.

_There is ‘no rest for the
weary Pitt wrestling team. In
their never-ending quest to
face the. toughest competition
around, the Panthers take on
sixth-ranked Lock Haven on
Friday night at 7:30 p.m. in
Fitzgerald Field House.

This,wil1 be Pitt’s sixth.

dual meet this season against
an opponent ranked in the
nation’s. top 10. So far, the

Panthers have gone 0-for-'5 '

but have gotten closer every
time, culminating in a one-
point loss last weekend at

. Penn State, then ranked sixth.

Pitt is looking to put all the

pieces together finally in one

big match.

“It’s always been just a lit-
tle something,” said Head
Coach Rande Stottlemyer.
“We didn’t have our full line-
up, or else we could’ve beat
Michigan State [then ranked
fourth] and Arizona State
[then eighth].” «

Pitt is currently ranked No.
21, where it has been since
Jan. 10.‘ ‘

“We’re not that far away. I’

guess that’s why we’re
ranked 21st,” Stottlemyer

said. ‘‘We’ve been right

A win can still give Pitt a
second-place finish, which

Still, not having a shot at
first is a little disappointing.

. “It‘would’ve been nice to
sit here and tell the guys this

Stottlemyer said. “But it’s for
pride now. Pride is a big
motivating factor for me, and
I hope it is’ for my team, too.”

Lock Haven brings to the

Things to Do in Denver When You’re
Dead

Directed by Gary Fleder

With Andy Garcia, Christopher Walken
and Gabrielle Anwar '

 

 

Gangster is. It is always wanting to
be a gangster. Men at the bottom of

the Hudson with tubs of cement for .

feet. Gangster is a meatlocker in the
Bronx. It is copacetic coke. And what-
ever gangster is, (this time ‘round) it
ain’t in Denver. It ain’t a dressed-for-
Wall-Street Andy Garcia makin’ babies
in Denver. It ain’t legitimate. And it ain’t
Garcia’s candlelit dinners with
Gabrielle Anwar in Denver.

Leave it to a stinking mug like Gary
Fleder to direct actors with better roles
in The Godfather Ill and The
Untouchables (Garcia), King of New
York (Walken) and Reservoir Dogs
(Buscemi) and play ‘em for the cachet
in a stiff script. Things to Do in Denver
is gangster ironed-out for a few hooks
and made formulaic. The script has

Jimmy the Saint. (Garcia)'pulli_ng a job --

for Christopher Walken -(l can’t bring
myself to use some these characters’
hokey names — Walken is theL5efrhe
Man with the-P|an"). Jimmy calls on
some two-bit loafs to do the job, and
when it “goes awry,” as critics are
trained to say, Walken issues a
Buckwheat for the whole lot of them (a
death sentence to be carried out as
painfully as possible). All except for
Jimmy, who is told to leave Denver and
never come back. i ‘
Not even when Walken imports gun-
for-hire Steve Buscemi (aka Mr. Shh)
can the story be saved from going
nowhere. Casting Buscemi.as “the
most lethal contract killer west of the
Mississippi” is one of the film’s tough-
est sells. Could you buy a bounty-

Hecuba herself, played by Pitt

not afraid to take chances with
his plays and with his actors.
Instead of falling into the com-
mon trap of unattractive pre-
tentiousness, Golebiewski

makes bold statements with,

his plays and has developed a
distinctive creativity with the
shows that he directs. In
Hecuba, a few neat elements
are introduced into the show
such as Talthybius’ usage of a
video camera during his mono-
logue, the whole stereo/walk-
man phenomena between
Polyxena and Hecuba and
some pretty nifty slides, which
made the show all the more
enjoyable.

Another aid to my “journey"
was the solidarity of the acting
company. The leading role of
Hecuba was played with fierce
intensity. Hecuba is the sort of
role that can be easily man-
gled because of its immensity,

Pitt hockey punishes Edinboro, 1 2-2, ready for playoffs

By Connie Nigro
Staff Writer

Brad Rizzo’s hat trick and three assists led the way as
the Panthers finished out their season in style, defeating
Edinboro 12-2 Saturday night at Neville Ice Rink.

Just about everyone was in on the scoring as Rizzo
compiled six points, followed by Steve Fisher, who tal-
lied four. The win brings Pitt’s overall record to
10-3-1 (9-1) as it prepares for the playoffs this week-
end. '

and 31 seconds into the first period, the Panthers went
on the‘ power play. After one second, Carter Leonards
scored, giving Pitt a quick 1-0 lead.

Rizzo’s solo effort in the Edinboro end created a
turnover that led to his ﬁrst unassisted goal of the night
at 11:13. Rizzo put two solid checks on an Edinboro
player behind the net, then skated away. He scored after
an Edinboro clearing attempt landed on his blade. A

This was not the last time the Edinboro goalie would
hear from Rizzo. With just under ﬁve minutes left in
the first period, Rizzo scored again, giving Pitt a -3-0

Pitt started off the second period much like the ﬁrst

advantage and made the best of it. At 12:34 Jason
Steyer scored on the two-man advantage, finally
putting Edinboro on the scoreboard. ‘ ,

Edinboro’s luck“ would run out just as quickly as it
had arrived. Edinboro returned the favor and gave Pitt
a two-man advantage at 11:03 of the second. Not only
did Edinboro get penalized, but one of its players was
ejected as Pitt’s two-man advantage began.

Pitt capitalized on the Edinboro penalties when
Fisher scored at 9:34 giving Pitt a 5-1 lead. Bob Hoehn
scored his second goal of the season on the power play
at 7:02, giving the Panthers a 6-1 lead.

Swimmers

Suﬁ" Writer

The buzzing of electric razors
and hair clippers shaving heads
and other body parts can be
heard throughout Oakland as
the men’s and women’s swim
teams prepare for the big one,
the Big East Championships.

The four-day meet starts
today with diving and ends on
Sunday with the ﬁnals and the
realization of whether a year’s
hard work has paid off.

“We start preparing for this
meet the day after it’s over,”

 men’s Head Coach Chuck

Knoles.

This year’s Big East meet
will have more teams and
swimmers than any in the past
because of the addition of Notre
Dame, West‘ Virginia and
Rutgers. This will make it hard-
er for Pitt to score and get its
swimmers into the finals and
consolations.

“The most important thing in
this meet is which team can
take advantage of getting their
swimmers into the bottom of
consolations and finals, and
that’s a tall order with 15
teams,” said Knoles.

Knoles sees the men’s meet

Pitt, Syracuse and Miami. As
for Syracuse, Pitt beat its team
in an early November invita-

the Panthers by ﬁve points last
year.

Miami has senior Mark

and Miami,” said Knoles.
“Between those couple of
swimmers at those schools, they
can clean up a lot of points.”

Freshman Preston Hamontree
is competing in his first Big
East. He will swim the 500 free,
200 ﬂy and 1650 free and is
seeded in the top eight in all of
them. With the looming pres-
sure-ﬁlled weekend, he admits
he isn’t nervous.

“I’m not nervous personally,
but the team is apprehensive
about the meet. It’s our meet to
win, and we know that. It will
come down to the last day, and
we have as good a chance as
anybody.”

Senior diver Jeremy McClean
was a freshman when Pitt lost

the Big East title for the first
time in 10 years.

“It would mean a lot to me if
we win, because I was part of
the class that lost for the first
time in 10 years. We’ve won it
once in the three years I’ve
been here, so I would like to get
it back, and we have a great
chance to win this year.”

For McClean, the additional
teams means more time
between dives and more com-

' petition. He still sees Pitt and
-Miami as the two diving teams

that will compete for points.

Pitt divers set high goals for Hurricncies, Big East

By Nichole Gantshar
Staff Writer

Pitt diver junior John Soulakis has

been claiming first or second at compe-
titions this season. His goal for the Big
East tournament at Trees Hall this
weekend?
_ “I’d really like to break up the Miami
divers,” said Soulakis. The words
“break up” may appear to be a strange
choice, but not when most expect the
University of Miami divers to finish
first, second and third in the men’s com-
petition.

Pitt’s coach, Julian Krug, puts it sim-
ply. “Jeremy [McClean] and John
should not be challenged for fourth and
fifth place.” -

Krug is not a pessimist. The
University of Miami was a diving force
long before Olympic champion Greg
Louganis competed there.

This year Miami will bring a talented
group of sophomores — Tyce Rouston,
Chris Mantilla and Bryan Gillolly —
who won ﬁrst, second and third in last

year’s NCAA 10-meter championships.
For Rouston, who hails from another
Olympic diving center, Mission Viejo,
Calif., and his teammates, the Big East
is one step on the way to qualiﬁng for
the Olympic trials. They have the record
in international competitions to back up
this goal.

Miami also has two

Spinnenweber securing a position in the
top eight and for freshmen Jill Dolbin to
add to the team’s score.

Pitt will host over 70 divers from a
number of schools. Other notables
include Syracuse’s Dave Rucker and
Brad Ripps, Rutgers’ Kevin Dunn and
Tom Chapman, and Pitt’s George
Anderson.

top women divers who  I I’
will compete for a
place in the top three ff
spots with juniors 
Tami Christensen and :.
Vicki Tuymer. Tuymer

Austrian National 315-
Diving team,

“There are a few
other divers who can
stick their nose in there
and be somebody,” said
Krug. He believes
Rutgers’ Lauren Lehrer
or Carrianne Eberhardt,
Notre Dame’s Liane
Gallagher, Syracuse’s
‘ Samantha Linke and

right behind Panther
Sunday Lewandowski at last year’s Big
East.

Pitt’s Lewandowski will step up to the
boards to defend her first-place ﬁnish on
both the one-" and three—meter at the
1995 Big East Championships. Krug’s
plan also includes junior Amy

University of
Connecticut’s Lisa Galpin will dive well
and help their teams rack up points.
“You want people who have a chance
at top eight,” said Krug. Top-eight fin-
ishers earn more points than divers who
ﬁnish ninth or below. Pitt will need the
top eight finishes to beat its main rival,

11

Syracuse.

Hosting so many swimmers and
divers results in a change of practice for
the team.

The diving squad “tapers off a little
bit,” said Krug. “We don’t have the dry
land training and cut out morning work-
outs.” The team can’t run through its
usual routine of mat tumbling and jump-
ing because Pitt has installed seating

where the team keeps its training equip-

ment.

Another difference this weekend will
be the 10-foot platform exhibition on
Sunday. At most collegiate diving
events, divers compete on the one- and
three—meter platforms. The Big East
provides a dress rehearsal for the NCAA
platform competition and allows the
audience to witness the spectacular
dives most only see during ‘ the
Olympics. Competition begins with the
three—meter on Thursday night. An all-
session student pass can be purchased
for $5 at the Pitt Stadium or individual

hard and hope for the best.”

“Richey’s definitely got it the toughest
this time,” Stottlemyer said. “But Lock
Haven is loaded.”

Lock Haven has six wrestlers ranked in
the country’s top 20 at their respective
weights, while Pitt has five. Besides Richey
and Kolat, there will be two other bouts
between ranked wrestlers.

The 142-pound bout will be one. Pitt’s J .J .
Fasnacht, ranked fifth, will take on No. 17
Brian Leitzel. In last year’s dual meet,

Fasnacht won 13-6.

The other bout pairing ranked wrestlers
will be at 167 pounds. Pitt’s Brian Matusic
is currently» ranked 14th at 177 pounds, but
has moved down to 167 pounds to prepare
for postseason tournaments. Matusic will

face Ben Keebler, ranked 19th at 167 '

pounds.

A win would tie the school record for
mostdual meet wins in a season, 14, set last
season. Friday night will be Pitt’s last
chance to accomplish that feat, as this will
be the final dual meet of the season.

Hockey

°From page 11

the second on an individual effort. Rizzo put a move
on the defenseman, then beat the goalie getting the

hat trick.

Even though Pitt had a 7-1 lead, the game didn’t
lack excitement. With 3:03 left in the second, Pitt
scored again. As Pitt celebrated its goal, Edinboro’s
Bryan Dayton cheap-shotted the Pitt goal scorer.
Edinboro’s frustration was evident. Pitt retaliated,

and there was a circle of confusion on the ice.

As the refs rushed in to break up the action,
Dayton kicked a Pitt player. The’ referee had to
refrain Dayton by tackling him to the ice. The only
action Dayton would see the rest of the night would
be in the locker room, as he was ejected from the

game and escorted off the ice.

With the regular season over, Pitt is looking for-

ward to the play-offs. .

"The play-offs are tough. We have to play well as a
team,” White said. “We have to keep our heads. We

can’t be stupid.”

Pitt will face Slippery Rock Friday night, and, if it

wins, Penn State on Saturday.

“I wanna play Penn State because it’s one of our

losses,” Hoehn said.

ﬁnished third — 15 points behind winner
Villanova and three points behind Miami.

This year in a duel meet with Villanova,
a close race in the final event gave the
Wildcats the win.

The Miami women have some of their
own standouts, including Janet Mayville,
who finished second in the 100 and 200
butterﬂy and the 200 I.M. Miami also has
sophomore Julie Mitchell who won the
1650 free as a freshman and placed second
in the 500 free. ’

The Lady Panthers improved in the regu-
lar season from 4-8 to 6-4 and are expect-
ing to have a great meet. Keen sees
Villanova and Miami as the favorites and
then Pitt and three or four other teams as
being able to compete for the champi-
onship. .

“We are definitely in a position to have a
great meet and that’s what our focus is,”
said Keen. “We’re not the favorite, but that
doesn’t bother this team. They don’t '
mind.” .

rushed prospects and such retum—
ing stars as John Lieber (4-7, 6.32
ERA), John Ericks (3-9, 4.58),
Esteban Loaiza (8-9, 5.16) and
Steve Parris (6-6, 5.38).

In other words, if you go to a
game when Neagle isn’t sched-
uled, bring your glove and rosin
bag — the Pirates might need you
come the fourth or ﬁfth inning.

That’s the bad news. The good
news is that with the new owner-
ship, the Pirates will actively pur-
sue big—name free agents to fill
the sinkholes in the lineup and the
pitching staff. 7

Right. To shore up the infield
and get some power hitting, the
Pirates signed third baseman
Charlie Hayes from Philadelphia.
The Phillies didn’t re-sign Hayes
in order to free up money to sign
Todd Zeile, a power-hitting third
baseman.

Also, to add experience behind
the plate, the Pirates inked Lance
Parrish to a minor-league con-
tract. Parrish was let go by the
Blue Jays and is currently one of
the oldest catchers in captivity. He
was also let go by the Phillies
because he was too old — back in
the late 1980s.

Finally, the Pirates bought some
pitching help in the form of
Darmy Darwin and.Zane Smith,

both signed to minor-league deals.

Darwin is approaching 40 and has
been kicked around the American
league for years. He was most

recently axed by the Texas
Rangers, a world-renowned pitch-
ing powerhouse.

Smith is the rare player whose
career has come full circle. He
played with the Pirates in the
NLCS days, left just like every-
one else on that squad with a
pulse, blew his arm out over the
next few years and now has
returned. The scary part is that the
Pirates are glad to have him back.

So in order to build a pennant
contender, Pirate management has
raided the old-age homes and
dumpsters of .500 ballclubs.

Help from the minors looks a
long way off, with the AAA club
in Calgary boasting no pitchers
with an ERA under four and no
l0-game winners. Matt Rubel, a
double-A standout last season in
Carolina, is currently in the big-
league camp and may crack the
lineup. So much for development.

It all comes to a head in about a
month, with the home opener
against Hayes-less Phillies in
early April. New owner Kevin
McClatchy plans to have a special
seating area added by then,
putting 72 seats in a special
grandstand section behind home
plate.

If the team plays as well as the
roster indicates, he may be able to
close the rest of the stadium and
have seats leftover.
