ing to Dan Stern, liberal arts

“We want all students to par-

Alumni Giving Campaign  
’~’»"Sets Record‘ Contributions-

The University has received
record ﬁnancial support this year
from its alumni, according to,
‘Philip K. Herr, chairman of the
Board of Directors of the Univer-
sity’s Annual Giving Fund. Al-

’, most 17 per cent more Alumni
contributed during the 1964-65
~ Annual Giving Fund than the pre-'
vious year. In addition, there
were approximately 275.non-«
alumni donors to the Fund.

“Total receipts from alumni
and non-alumni _. for this year
were $501,369,” Herr said. “There
were, in addition, a signiﬁcant
number- of pledges madeﬁfor fu-
ture contributions especially by
denistry ,and pharmacy alumni
who conducted special campaigns.
The number of ‘alumni who con-
tributed totalled 7,019 and their
cash gifts were in excess of $425,-
000.” ‘

. This year's contributions were
- the highest in the history of the’

“During this (present) period,
when a number of the Universi-

ty’s problems were a. subject of ’

controversial public discussion it
was encouraging to note that Uni-
versity. alumni and. friends re-
sponded to the expressed needs
of their alma mater and gaveit
good support,” Herr said.

"These funds could, not have
come at ‘.a better time. They can
help reduce the critical margin
of difference between the Uni-
versity’s continuing needs and its
foreseeable sources, of income.”

Nancy Welfer, president of the
University General Alumni As-
sociation, added that she believed
University alumni were made

needs as a ‘result of its appeal
for emergency funds from the

'SG passed procedures for con-

held two weeks after the Sen-
ate’s adoption of a constitutional
amendment.

There constitutional amend-
ments. were tabled. They dealt
with such matters as changes in

the senate’s composition and a,-

permanent date for SG elections.
These resolutions were tabled
to avoid duplication of time and
effort since Hogan appointed _a

SG approved a procedure to be
followed when a vice-president
becomes president to remedy the
constitution’s lack of provision
for a president's resignation. The

PI» . M

By CHARLES REINER

~yI_One of the biggest fears for
many American males between
the ages of 19 and 26% is “Will
I be drafted?” Yet through ‘a ran-
dom interview it appears that
the majority of male students at
the University are not so fear-
some of that letter from the Se-
lective Service Bureau. The ma-
.jority are both in favor of the
; U.S. policy in Vietnam and would
be willing to ﬁght if drafted.

,_ For most college students there
is little to’ fear now. As the draft
quota stands now, any under-
a» graduate, matriculating college
.. students who are in good stand-
“ing (usually this means -a “C”
yaverage) are exempt from the
5;. draft. The present quota also
 exempts all medical students, law
7 students, and many graduate stu-
,“dents who have been able to
procure the valuable “2S” stand-
, But‘ what would happen if the

crisis in Vietnam was escalated

.to such an extent that the col-

lege student found that he lost

This “2s" standing? With this in

mind, some 24 students were

;_asked two questions: “If you

 were drafted, would you go?”

and “Do you feel that the United

serve my country.” Or:
don’t believe in war, I’d be a
conscientious objector.” “. . . I’d
rather go to jail than ﬁght for
this country.” Altogether two-
thirds of the students (16) said
they would deﬁnitely go into
service if they were called. While
almost one-quarter: (5) said they
would not go, and one-eighth (3)
said they didn’t know.

The only group of students that
had a complete concensus of
opinion was the ROTC members
who all said that they would go
into service upon being called.
The largest number of “no” .an-
swers came from the commuter
students where two out of the
ﬁve students questioned said they
wouldn’t go into service if they
were drafted‘.

The replies received for the

second question were somewhat '

more detailed. “. . . The line has
to be drawn somewhere and
there’s no sense letting this war
get any bigger than it really is.”
“. . . Being the great democracy
that we are, we should spread
our system to as many other

licy In Vietnam

Drafted

countries as possible.” “. . . I
feel we have committed our-
selves. The whole world is look-
ing at us and if we go down, a
good part of the world will go
down with us.”

On the other hand, some felt:
“. . . I don’t think we should be
there. It doesn’t concern us. It
just shows the world another ex-
ample of U.S. imperialism.” “. . .
It’s up to the Vietnamese if they
want democracy or Communism.”

For this question, 15 students
felt that the U.S. was right, while
seven students felt the U.S. was
wrong and two had no opinion.

, While in the ﬁrst question all of

the ROTC students interviewed

-were sure they would go if they

were drafted, this time only half

felt that the U.s. should. be in

Vietnam.

The only group that had a com-

plete consensus of opinion for the I

second question was the graduate

students who all felt that the U.S. '
.was right.

._ States is right in its position con-
» cerning Vietnam?”

 Yiddish Writer Singer ”‘
Discusses Polish Life

By BERNI McLEOD

A person may take decades to
form a “philosophy of life” which
is founded on experience. In time,
this philosophy can direct much
of his work, as in the case of
novelist Isaac Bashevis Singer,
who spoke Thursday at a noon
presentation‘ of the B’nai B’rith
Hillel Foundation.

Introduced as “the most dis-
tinguished novelist writing about
Jewish life today,” Singer chose
to speak of his boyhood in P0-
land, and later experiences which
influenced his writings and his
ideas on life.

“I wrote before I knew the
alphabet,” he began, speaking of
his early homelife. “In our fam-
ily, education was greatly valued.
The most important questions
From
such a background his skill at

~ story telling began.

“I use to confound my fellow
students, by. my stories,” he con-
tinued. “I told them that my fa.-
ther was king with such detail
that they believed me. Unfortun-
ately, my clothes could prove that

I was no prince.”
‘ Growing up during revolution-

ary times in Poland, Singer saw

a great deal of misery. This was
hard on his sensitive nature since,
as he noted, “The sight of a cat
eating a mouse would sicken me.”
As a member of the Jewish com-
munity, however, he could re-
main apart from political condi-
tions and continued on an edu-
cation which‘ included a great;
deal of reading. L
“I even read Poe in Yiddish,”
he mentioned. “They couldn’t kill
Poe in translation.” However, his
stress upon intelligence some-
times reached odd proportions.
Singer noted_whimsically that as
a boy, he had often considered
killing himself because of his “in-
tellectual impotence.” “Outside,
I wasa calm, religious boy,” he
remarked. “The town suspected
me anyhow, for they considered
me an ‘exotic plan .” . ;, - 5:
lSinger‘s talk,‘ often punctuated
with wry, and genuine’ humor,
was replaced by. a more seriigus

. . quality when he ‘began to 

earnest abouthis philosophy con-
cerning God, man, and the role
of the creative individual. “I had

. The innovation of student-faculty-parents seminars for Parents’ Week-
end may be the most astute programming done by a campus organization
to date. _ 0-

Plans for the weekend were first formulated several weeks ago be-
fore the Student Government controversy ‘arose. It would have been easy
to*"leave the program as originally planned. The extra effort expended to
include the “Changing Morals” and “Berkeley at Pitt” seminars enriches

'ffthe program and deserves commendation.

Parents of students deserve the opportunity to hear a responsible

rdiscussion on the major issues permeating life at the University. Such

discussions serve to orient parents who are either totally removed from

:campus events or rely on press service reports.

The participation of faculty members on the panels indicates the ful-

gfillment of necessary responsibility. Many professors at this University
jgmerely lecture .Many privately mock student mores and University
_; policies.

Few professors come out of the classroom to exchange ideas with

2 students. Few consider the student more than anumber on a registration

sheet. Few truly contribute to creating the “whole” person envisioned by

the liberal arts philosophy.

Those participating in the Parents’ Weekend forum exhibit that all
faculty members are not detached from students. Their participation

shows there is grounds for more endeavors involving student-faculty
I.-cooperation. 0

Whether the potentialities of this program reach fruition will prove

-3 a decisive index to both student and parent interest in significant campus

affairs. , 1
If few of the parents registered for the weekend attend, they will

I A ;be neglecting a responsibility to do more than merely pay fees’ and send ’

    
 

. their youngadolescents away for four years. '

If students do not participate they will be conveying the impression
of student apathy. They will be presenting an image of unconcern and
irresponsibility. » _ A s V

If the program is mismanaged or if participants do not present a

clear’ outlook, the one potentially ‘enriching aspect of the Weekend will

have failed. The weekend will then amount to nothing more than a foot-
ball game and some formal socializing.

Letters

The leader was different, but the game was the same. Such was the
essence of last Thursday's Student Government meeting.

New President Jerry Hogan presented a concrete programming plan;
Eric Stern never presented a plan. Hogan's first meeting lacked excite-
ment; Stern's meetings were never dull. Something was accomplished at
the meeting; nothing was accomplished at previous meetings.

Despite the change in leadership, much of the Senate displayed its
usual gamemanship based on ignorance. Senators have yet to learn how
to operate efficiently in a system bounded by parliamentary procedure.

Senators presented motions which conflicted with the purpose of the
previously-formed Constitutional Revision Committee. The three separate
constitutional amendments toncerned SG elections and required a refer-
endum. The constitution committee was created to present revisions in

- the same areas. -

N ewly-appointed Vice-P}esident Marcia‘Bern_stein also suffered from
parliamentary ignorance. When_ she was indecisive, senators corrected

. one another with incorrect statements of parliamentary procedure. When

Vice-President Bernstein was in doubt, she turned to Senator John Rus-
kay who quickly pulled out his little black book of Robert's Rules of Order
and alleviated the crisis. / -

Other Senators lacked knowledge about routine ‘SG activities. They
did not know about SG finances for Parents’ Weekend and Homecoming.
When the respective chairmen were questioned, they failed to present suf-
ficient explanation. The SG director of finance was not present, so SG
financial adviser John Vrana had to be consulted. I -

But the SG outlook is not ‘all gloomy. Senators Ruskay, Rick Schwed-
er, and Gerry Rosen noted the duplication of effort created by the three
constitutional amendments and a majority of the Senators voted to -table
the ‘motions.

Someone other than the presiding officer had a copy of the parlia- ‘

mentary rules of order. And Senators of opposing parties spoke jointly
for responsible handling of the legislation. — pp

An official parliamentarian, not a senator acting as parliamentarian,
might improve the SG meetings. .A thorough knowledge of the rules by
the presiding officer and copies of Roberts Rules of Order for all Senators
would also hasten the -removal _of ignorance as a basis for action in Stu-_
dent Government. ,

Aid in Fighting
Government’s

Crimes Asked

‘Editor, The Pitt News:

_A scarecrow has been hung on

every campus across the nation.
I03 Sept. 15 Judge Timbers of

United States District Court, New

.Haven, Conn., sentenced me to

18 months to ﬁve ears and $5,-
000 ﬁne pfor refus rig to submit

I to, induction. It will be ﬁve years
in effect, unless I guarantee to be
inducted after serving 18 months.

There was no trial. The pow-

_-_ers that lack the courage to go

to Congress for a legal facade for
their criminal war in Vietnam,
also indicated their fear of my
case being aired. The-judge cal-
lously tore to shreads my rights
to counsel of my choice and to
due process. It was so obvious
that the American Civil Liber-
ties Union rushed in with an of-
fer of an amicus curie brief call-
ing for a mistrial because my
rights\ had been violated.

The court’s motives were clear;

it stated that: my views on Viet- '
. nam torture and genocide, my

views on American aggression
and domination from the Congo
to Santa Domingo,’ are “wholly
irrelevant.”

LITTLE MAN’ ON CAMPUS  

 The

The judge, paralleling the Nazi ‘

judges depicted in the movie

Judgment at Nuremberg, admin-—

istered the technicalities (even
those unfairly) while protecting
the criminal content of the law.
My treatment and my sentence
is the deterrent . . . “to deter
others who may have notions or
ideas that they can avoid serv-
ice . . ."

That is the scarecrow to_fright-
en you. The threat is ﬁne and
imprisonment. The price of im-
munity is a harnessed mind and
a gagged mouth when our gov-
ernment demands - that we tor-
ture, murder and subjugate other
people. The. price is silence and

murder.

. The Germans. paid the price to
Hitler. They submitted to the call

for “law and order” which pro-
tected and executed the Nazi
crimes. They were told at Nurem-
berg what they knew all along
that the individual does have a
responsibility to refuse and chal-
lenge the crimes of his govern-
ment—regard1ess.of laws and or-
ders. l "

I The facts of America's crimes "
are clear. Now the question is

posed. The government has drawn
the batteline and continues to
place its scarecrows. Now what?
Does the battle begin or does it
end here? Do we heil the judges
or do we hail‘ peace and liberty?
Do we goosestep down the path
of Germany or do we summon
the treason of I_n0.rality«- to rip the
scarecrow from our conscience
and do battle with murder?

Panthers Out — gunned By Navy,

Being Frank

by FRANK SMIZIK
Sports Editor

 

“OH MY ACHING BACK”

WASHINGTON, D.C., OCT. 16—The sky was very blue
at D.C. Stadium, and the one who knew it best was Panther
quarterback Kenny Lucas. He was always looking up at it.
The Navy defense said “take me to your leader” and the
offensive line obliged by showing them the way.

“Their blitz killed us,” said John Micholosen. “We
couldn’t hit them hard enough or move them at all.”

It’s difficult to complete passes and make the offense
go when you’re lying flat on your back. That was the ‘task
Kenny Lucas had. Countless numbers of times receivers
outmanuevered the Navy secondary only to see their quar-
terback torpedoed. _ _

The offense tried a new formation using twelve men,
however, only eleven were Panthers. The twelfth man was
Chris Hoch, a Navy linebacker who had no trouble at all
working his way into the Panther backfield. He couldn’t
have been in the backfield faster if he had been a set back.

He was more of a man in motion, however, and must
have said the password to the center of the line because
they always let him go through. The Navy linebackers and
secondary were in on Lucas so quickly that the men in_the
offensive backfield couldn’t even get in the correct positions
to block them out and form a pocket.

TOUGHEST LOSS

Of the fourlosses this year this had to be the toughest
for the Panthers to lose. The defense came back strong and
played their best game of the season. They c2_1I§1e up with
several big plays and put the ball in good position for the
offense to score.

This was the week for the defense and not the offense
and one of these afternoons, hopefully before the season IS
over, the two squads will get together and decide to have a
good game. Then we might defeat someone. . _

The defense was after a win very badly for they hit
hard and gang tackled more often than they had_ the _whole
season. Mickey Depp, playing for the second time in the.
Pant-her secondary also played ball hawk by intercepting
two passes and recovering one fuI_nble_. _ -

‘ The Midshipmen also played inspired defensive football.
A great play by defensive end Ray Hill, who blocked an

' Andy McGraw punt, set up the ﬁrst Navy touchdown-

“McGraw is slow in getting his punt off and he was
outside of his blocking, which is why the punt was blocked,
said John Michelosen.  _ _

Navy Coach Bill Elias saw the blocked punt in a differ-
ent perspective. “We had been working on the play _all week
because we noticed that if we would fake to one side they
would relax on the other side and we could get right in.
We did.”

McGraw had done a great job throughout the whole.
game putting the midshipmen close to their own goal. He
continually dropped punts inside the 10 yard line.

TURNING POINT .

The turning point of the game came when the Midship-

, men defense held the Panthers from scoring from the two
yard line with four tries to do it in. “Our runners couldn’t
run where there were no holes,” said John Michelosen, “and
our line didn’t do anything at all when we were down close.“
A great tribute should be given to the hard charging
Navy defense, but we shouldn't take anything away from
the weak blocking Panther offensive line. I 1
The way to counteract the blitz is by use of the draw
play or the screen pass. When Lucas tried the screen pass

~ he didn’t have time to let his receiver get into position and

was hit. When he tried the draw play to McKnight, except
for the first quarter, McKnight was hit before he could get
started. 1 _

It may have been the southern air that the Panthers
have been exposed to the last three weeks which has caused
them to lose three in a row, but the real reason seems to be
an inability to play well both offensively and defensively
on the same afternoon.

. Booters Edge Slippery Rock,Z T-1"

 

   

Last Minute Goal Decides amei

By GEORGE LIES

‘One of the largest soccer
crowds of the season watch-
ed -Sal Tavares kick a goal
in the ﬁnal two minutes of
play to help the booters save
face and defeat Slippery
Rock, 2-1.

Tavares’ goal came moments

after coach Leo Bemis rearranged
his offensive structure. Instead

' of playing a four man line as he

used throughout the major por-
tion of the game, Bemis set up a
three-two or “W” offense which
is used by most, soccer teams.
“I .wanted more pressure up
there,” said Bemis, “because with-
out the one insideman, Slippery
Rock's defense could kick the ball
through the holes, but this way,
they had to get the ball past four
men. (Bemis uses only one in-
side position in his offense.) Be-
fore when they got the ball by
our forwards, our halfbacks kick-
ed it back up ﬁeld, but in the

ﬁnal minutes of play, I tried this
because we weren’t going to play‘

for a tie.” ,

In the opening quarter of the
contest, it looked as though the
soccermen would win easily as
Tavares kicked a high shot across
the mouth of the goal and Dom
Milillo headed the ball into the
nets for a 1-0 lead. This margin
stood until midway’ in the sec-
ond period. A scramble occured
in front of_the booter’s goal and
when one of the. defensive men
missed a swipe at the ball, Frank

‘ Lubinski, a speedy forward, stuck

it in the goal. 

The one-all‘ score held until
TaV.ares scored
quarter, giving the soccermen a
3-1-1 record-. .‘.fWhen I got the
ball, their fullback came at me.
So I pushed the ball to‘ the right
and, aiming for the far corner
to the left of the goalie, I hooked
it with my left foot for the score,”
Tavares said. “This one felt real
good since I've been hurting f01‘
scores all season.”

Before the,_ game, Bemis and
most of the players thought this
one would be easier than it was,
but as it turned out, the booters
fought for everything as the game
drew to a close.

“Individually, we_ have more
ability than Slippery Rock. but in
_this game, we made mistakes."
-Bemis said. “We let them know
