Speaker Advocates Humanities
Speaking of education, Mr.
Klein said that his attitude on

' scholarship may be considered

old-fashioned.

,"He feels that the basic element
of an education is the development
of perspective, depth of under-

 standing, and breadth of vision

that“can come only from vital
contact with the humanities.

“A viewpoint which is based

0 ' chieflyon emotion is a prejudiced

one; a viewpoint must be based on
factual material,” he says.

Mr. Klein concluded, “College-

’ V bred isn’t a four year’s loaf.”

This year, the Scholar’s Day

__ program consists of an introduc-
 tion by Cyril Wecht, student chair-
A man; musical selections; presen-
qtations of individual awards by

Claude Thornhill Will Play

At First Commons Dance

Claude Thornhill, his piano, and
his orchestra have been named to
play at the Senior Dance this
year. The dance will have two
unique features. It will be held
in the Commons‘Room, something
that has never been done before,
and the seniors will receive per-
sonal invitations by mail. The
dance is set for Friday, June 8,
from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m.

Christy Connor and The Snow-
ﬂakes will take care of the vocal-
izing.

Tickets will go on sale Mon-
day, May 7, at $4.50. The com-
mittee feels that by charging this
price and limiting the number of
tickets sold, there will be adequate
space for dancing.

Chairman Bill McKinley an-

?nounces that anyone interested in
working on. this dance should
leave his name and telephone
number at the Student Desk.

Positions are available on all
commitees, including tickets, dec-
orations, and programs.

Applicants must be in their
junior or senior year, and should
state their committee prefer-
ence at the time of their applica-
tion.

This dance marks the end of a
long struggle for Student Congress
and other interested parties. For
the past two years the Undergrad-
uate Deans have been rejecting
suggestions for Commons Room
dances. This is the ﬁrst of two
dances they have agreed to try
out.

 Frat Men to Collect Paper

For Hill City Relief Fund

Members of ﬁfteen Pitt fraternities have volunteered

and magazines tomorrow.

P their services for a house-to-house canvass for waste paper

Proceeds from the sale of the
paper collected will be donated to
Pittsburgh’s Hill City as a start to-
Ward its 1951 subscription goal of
$25,000. The money raised through
these annual drives is the main
support for the Bedford avenue

a “model youth city.”

William Stark, Pitt ’38, owner of

I Penn Overall Supply, Inc., has of-

fered 15 trucks and drivers in ad-
dition to supplying the gas and the

{twine for bundling the paper.
. , V» Howard McKinney, Pitt ’29, for-

mer city detective, established
Hill City in 1939 as an aid in com-
bating juvenile delinquency in the
Hill district.

According to Stark, “Hill City
has saved the city at least $25,000
a year by reducing ﬁre alarms
alone. It teaches responsibility in
democratic citizenship; it’s a won-
derful insurance policy.”

The fraternities will collect from
9 a.m. to 2 p.m. in Wilkinsburg,
Homewood, East Liberty, Squirrel
Hill, Dormont, Mt. Lebanon, Oak-
mont, Carrick, and Brentwood.

public officials in the state.
Ratiﬁed by the faculties of The

College, the Schools of Business

Administration, Law, P u b 1 i c
Health, Social Work, and the Re-
search Bureau for Retail Training,
the statement expresses the facul-
ties’ desire to “demonstrate their
loyalty to the Nation and the Com-
monwealth through subscribing to
the oath which . . . the Constitu-
tion of Pennsylvania requires of
all senators and representatives
and all judicial, state and county
oﬂicers.”

Still under considerationyby the
School of Education and other fac-
ulty groups, the statement affirms
the faculties’ “vital interest in pre-
venting the spread of Commu-
nism” and urged disapproval of
the bill on the grounds that it has
a “dangerous tendency to give to
an administrative official power of
deﬁnition amounting to thought
control.”

Dean Stlldies
Student Unions
At Meeting

Plans for the long-desired stu-
dent union building have not been
forgotten.

Theodore W. Biddle, dean of
men, is attending a conference
sponsored by the Association of
College- Unions in Lansing, Mich-
igan this week.

The conference, an annual af-
fair, is held so that representa-
tives from colleges that have stu-
dent unions or those that are in-
terested in such recreational or-
ganizations can air their views
and discuss plans.

Plans for the Pitt student cen-
ter were shelved temporarily be-
cause of the present unsettled
times.

University otﬁcials were not
sure that it would be possible to
build a student union under pres-
ent government regulations.

Student Congress will meet
this afternoon in a_ special
session to reinvestigate re-
cent student election results

tent rumors of fraud and mis-
handling during post—election
ballot counting. ~ .

Their decision, to be handed
down at Monday’s regular meet-

defeated Student Congress candi-
date Dolores Schaub’s charge that
she was “treated unfairly” and the
election as a whole was handled
in a “slipshod” manner.

Elect Oﬁicers Tuesday .

Their decision will have to,be
accepted at the Monday meeting
in order that new members may
be declared officially elected and
able to vote for new Congress of-
ﬁcers at the SC banquet Tuesday
night.

Miss Schaub’s charges arose
from her losing a senior Congress
position to Ann Curran by one’
vote.

Miss Curran’s victory was shown
by a second count of the ballots
made on last Friday. .

A ﬁrst count, however, made the
night of the election, showed Miss
Schaub as the winner by four
votes.

She claimed later in a letter to
Congress that 14 votes were “lost”
and that the entire election pro-
cedure was handled in a “slip-
shod manner.” Howard Green-
berger, Student Congress presi-
dent, has vehemently denied both
charges.

“Vicious Lie . . .”

“It is a vicious lie that any bal-
lots were lost,” he told the News.
The discrepancy in the results of
the two counts, he pointed out,
is due to the fact that a hand count
with such a large number of votes

twice.

William F. Saalbach, assistant
to the dean of men, backed up
Greenberger”. statement. He.stat-
ed that the “tallying was better"
this «year than it has been since
1947 in that it was “more thor-
ough.” Mr. Saalbach was in
charge of the election from the
DOM’s ofﬁce.

Greenberger termed Miss
Schaub’s charges as “emotional.”

“They’re groundless!” he said.

tioriary and books like Roget’s
I Thesarus in ﬁnding what he called
_ “the bright, particular word.”

The Value of ‘a literary agent to
a writer was discussed by Henry
Volkening, a New York literary
agent, at 10:30 a.m. yesterday. Mr.

University, and John Crowe Ran-

som, editor of the Kenyon Review

however, the board of deans per-

Hollywood Buys
Student Talent
For Film

The MGM movie “The
Angel and the Pirates" has
had a marked affect on Pitt
students.

Numerous Pittites have
been hired for mob scenes and
bit parts as eager fans cheer-
ing and booing in Forbes
Field, and the lucky ones who
have taken part in the movie
are already considering them-
selves full-ﬂedged actors.

Pastel shades in shirts and
trousers, dark glasses and a
rather dreamy look are the
identifying marks of these
embryo Alan Ladds and Janet
Leighs.

Although the standard sal-
ary for the participants in
mob scenes is $6 per day,
one student is reported to
have made $35 for standing
up and screaming, “Hey, Look
out!”

The link is strong

The telephone forms an important link
In our program of defense.

It speeds the urgent, vital calls

Of government, industry,

The armed forces and civil defense.
And the link it forms is strong.

Since the end of World War II,

Over thirteen million new telephones
Have been added to the Bell‘ System.
Billions of dollars have been spent

For new equipment of all kinds.

The quality and scope of service

Have constantly improved.

It's a good thing

The telephone has grown —

It is now better equipped

A Ellsworth Obituary

Funeral services for Ellsw

be dead after this semester.

Six months from now, EC alumni will remember’ the Center
as you remember a stingy, stubborn uncle who occasionally
breaks down and treats the kids to ice cream. You cuss him

out while he’s alive, but when he’s

too bad, after all.
A year at “the big school” has
made me realize a few things

The trouble with the place was

best thing about the Center was
that the students were all men.’
Without women, men can relax.

Classes Less Formal
There was an easy informality

sometimes separated only by plas-
terboard partitions, that can nev-

ful, frozen stone ofthis “inverted

passages, and its more digniﬁed,
better-dressed citizens.

S Picture your favorite teacher
climbing on top of the lectern ta-
ble, grinning and shouting. One
of mine_did that, acting as prose-

trial that got so exciting it was
continued for three class periods.

There were no frustrating ele-
vator doors cutting you off, no

ed janitor’s buckets on the wind-
ing back stairs. ’-If you came to

school early, you were liable to
ﬁnd one of the football players
who roomed there in pajamas in

.the washroom, shaving.

You got to know tfrosh football
players who make up today’s var-
sity, because you brushed shoul-
ders with them V in class and
watched them bump heads at prac-
tice in the afternoon.

Tuck Shop Was Hangout

It was rare when you couldn’t
ﬁnd a seat and a friend in" the EC
Tuck Shop, and if you wanted to,

you could ﬁll in at a game of gin
rummy, hearts, or 500 when some-
body quit to go to class.‘ There
were usually a few touch football
or softball games at lunch time,
and nobody cared much if you
were a few minutes _ late for
French class because you stayed
to get that last chance at a hit or
a touchdown.

Informality often made derr'1on-
stration talks in speech classes ex-
citing things. One student brought
in a bow with a sixty-pound pull
to demonstrate.'Finishing, he said,
“Here’s how you useit,” and sent
an arrow zipping through the open

window into the fortunately empty
ﬁeld behind the school. ‘i '

Firecracker to Nth Power

Another speech " on the atom
bomb “ended. with a graphic dem-
onstration of a blast when the
speaker set off a ﬁrecracker that
made ears ring for hours after-
ward.

Teachers were people you talk-
ed to and even ate with at Ells-
worth. The EC library didn’t have
the most books, but it had most of
the best. Sure, some students
abused the informality and friend-
liness, but helped take a little
grief out of the learning process.

Men Starved. Girls Ogled

Any EC student starved for the
stimulation of pretty faces and any
girl who was ogled on her way to
a lab would tell you that Ells-
worth isn’t perfect.

Honest, I am not saying I’d like
to- see this distinguished Univer-
sity deteriorate into a school with
a T-shirt and jeans student body,
bursting ﬁrecrackers,__or teachers
on tables. Gothic arches seem to
go hand in ‘hand with culture ‘and
dignity, including ties and suits,
formal lectures, and controlled
voices.

Ellsworth was poor in many
things, including women’s wash-
rooms, the reason why there were
no women students at the Center,
I have heard. But you could ﬁnd
everywhere at Ellsworth some-
thing that is pretty rare on the
mam campus.

Call it neighborliness.

Off-campus Vi

pers

ED JENSEN

This has been a rought year for the educators. First it

was the Korean war, then the

draft, then inﬂation, and now

it’s the loyalty oath. If our patriotic, duly elected represen-
tatives up in Harrisburg have their way,‘ the next thing will
be a fullfledged inquisition with senior vice—commanders

from the local Legion posts act—¢

The profs can hardly be blamed
if their collective outlooks are
pessemistic. As a matter of fact,
they could hardly be blamed if
they had no outlooks. Better for
them if they retreated into Plato
and Aristotle and forgot about
the whole thing.

Old Grads Gone Wrong

But I imagine that there are
many profs who have developed
a sort of secondary guilt com-
plex. After all, most of the boys
who are after their scalps are
college grads. True, they are old

nevertheless. _

It must give the profs a turn
when they pick up a newspaper
and note that one of their fair-
haired lads up in Harrisburg or
Washington is plotting against the
educational system. One of those
wide—eyed young boys who sat
at their feet for a couple of years
ahd listened to their words has
gone out into the wide world and

turned on them like a Viper.

And most of the “lawmakers”
do have college degrees.’ They
were exposed to the system for
at least four years, some more.
They have been nurtured on the
theory that all men are" created
equal. They have been told that
it is more admirable to be toler-
ant than intolerant.

None Are Communists

.Next to General of the Armies
Douglas MacArthur, they proba-
bly venerate Jefferson and Jack-
son as -great Americans. Some of
them may even have read the
Constitutions of the United States
and Pennsylvania. And-none
of them will admit to being card-
carrying Communists.

All of which seems to indicate
that our educational system as it
now operates fails to instill the
basic tenets upon which this coun-
try rests into a great majority of
the students. At least, it very

-deﬁnitely proves that to a certain

type of energetic person—the poli-

tician—democracy is a lot of hog-
wash.

It further indicates that all of
the high sounding ideals about
which profs are so prone to ex-
pound, and which are always
found in the prefaces of the text-
books, are in practice nothing
more than words. They die be-
fore they get off the campus. The
only group to whom they have
any importance are the students
who eventually become profs, and
they continue toiexpound them
here.

Can't Teach Democracy

The consequences are easy to
see. Democracy as a way of life
that can be taught is something
like Homer. It is only a classroom
subject and not a guide to living.
For Senator McCarthy and .Rep—
resentative Pechan up in Harris-
bur-g are deﬁnitely not practicing
the democracy they were taught.

Either we, who expect them to
practice this scholastic brand of
democracy, are naive or we are
laboring under an obscene and
grotesque misconception.

The next few weeks in Harris-
burg will determine which. The
situation up in D. C. points to-
ward a misconception.

Wecht vs. McKinley

A BOB ' THOMAS

If present indications mean anything at all, Tuesday’s

battle for the presidency of

Student Congress at the an-

nual SC banquet is going to be a killer.

It shapes up as a show-down ﬁg

president Bill McKinley
Cyril Wecht. For most of the year.
McKinley had looked like a shoo-

cently pushed into the forefront
as a strong candidate. ‘

Outsiders Might Win

Theoretically, every Congress-
man is in line for nomination to
the presidency but only a few are
given even an outside chance. As
one four-year veteran of Pitt po-
wars ﬁgured Wednesday,
Bob Gardner, Roger B,ognar, Bill
Green, and perhaps one or two
others might get it, but the odds
against it,are great.

Gardner and Green, present
Congress treasurer, apparently
have the best chance among the
outsiders, especially if the Wecht-

A
and‘

mate and a compromise candidate
is needed. . y . -

Meanwhile a fantastic amount
of political maneuvering is going
on. Both the Wecht and McKin-
ley supporters are making deter-
mined eiforts to line up the votes
of the women on Congress. They
probably will play a decisive part
in the election.

Women Pestered
Evidence of this behind-the-
scenes battle of the sexes appears
in the recent statement of one
potential woman vote that, “I’ve
never had so many calls for dates
in my life since they’ve found out
I’m going to be on Congress.”
There seems to be no‘ strong
presidential candidate among the
women. -

I

ht between present vice-A

Other questionable votes will
come from Men’s Council which
sends two, representatives to Con-
gress. The men were elected last
night but at News deadline time
it looked as if Wecht might pick
up both votes, judging from the
political leanings of the strong
candidates for the jobs.

Crucial Election Monday

Monday, Congress will elect in-
ternally a woman to take the
place of Betty Douglas who re-
signed two weeks ago. Wecht and
McKinley forces will probably
ﬁght this one out on the line also
in order to get a woman in who
seems to. favor one or the other.

The election recount this after-
noon also holds at least one po-
tential vote for Wecht or McKin-
ley. Should the ousted Dolores
Schaub again be declared elected,
the issue would be in doubt, but
if Ann Curran stays on Congress,
McKinley stands to pick up an-
other vote.

Student Government A 

An’ open letter to the Pitt student:

Through my conversations with
many of these students, faculty

and administrators I have become.

convinced that the trend in Amer-
ican colleges is away from stu-
dent governments, as such, and
toward what has been termed
community "government.

In simple terms this means that
students are beginning to realize
that only by cooperation with fac-
ulty and administration can the
real problems of the educational
community be solved. Here at
Pitt we are approaching this ideal
form of student government. May
I enumerate the University corn-
mittees on which students are now
sitting with an equal voice and
vote: The University Social Com-
mittee, the High School Day Com-'

The democratic method that our

student government employs is es-
sential for training people in dem-
ocracy whether it obtains any im-
mediate results or not. I assert
that democracy is always worth
ﬁghting for and if it has not
reached perfection as yet, that is
no call for discarding it. However,
the startling fact remains that if
we analyze the accomplishments
of your student -government, we
really ﬁnd that they are quite ex-

W. Virginia
Shuts Out
Panthers

By BORIS WEINSTEIN ’
Sports Writer

The poor hitting and sloppy
ﬁelding that have plagued the
Pitt baseball team this season
were in evidence again Wed-
nesday afternoon when West
Virginia shut out the Panth-

ers, 7-0, at Schenley Oval.
The Mittmen collected only ﬁve

.hits—two of them in the ninth
“ inning-—and committed six costly

errors in losing. Five of the
Mountaineer runs were unearned
because of Pitt’s faulty ﬁelding.
Russell Loses Third

Pitt’s batsmen didn't fare too
well, either. Only in the ninth in-
ning did they make any kind of a
threat. With one out, Nick Kostek
and Bill Marhelka singled, but

' were left on base when Pat Mur-

phy and Dave Devey were retired.

Righthander Bob Russell start-
ed on the mound for the Panthers
and was charged with his third
defeat of the season. Southpaw
Ray Hollis pitched the ninth in-
ning, allowing two of the Moun-
taineer’s seven runs on three hits.

The parade of unearned runs
began in the second inning when,
with one runner on and two out,
Joe Scalzo fumbled Wilbur Stan-
1ey’s easy grounder. West Virginia
went on to score one ‘run.

More Eerrors

In the sixth inning, Devey and
Russell contributed errors to per-
mit two more runs to cross the
plate and all but wrap up the con-
test for Morgan. ,

Three other Pitt errors led to
the West Virginia tallies in the
seventh and eight innings.

only one semester completed by next fall, he will
be ineligible unless his status is cleared up.

DISCARDS from  3

 

_ By WILL DOERGE
 Sports Editor

Track ought to be a big sport at Pitt——but‘ it isn’t. 

fact, track is almost a dead sport as far as interest is con-

cerned.

And what’s making it a dead sport is the lack of home

appearances by’ the thinclads-——not~O
to mention their measly overall

schedule.

This season, only four

State meet on May 19.

Certainly that is no kind of a
schedule for a team in any sport. .
Why Pitt doesn’t have a half-de-S‘

dual
meets were carded, with only one
of these meets at home——the Penn

.,  cent schedule is a real puzzler.

Unfair to Track

 t A Pitt opened its season last Sat-
 . urday at Miami of Ohio, losing a
thriller by 111-; of a point. Home
fans deserve some of that bill of

fare. .
It’s a shame that track

is

being ignored here to the ex-

tent that only one home me

et

was “carded for this season.

It’s unfair
to the students.

All that Carl Olson’s trackmen
seem to do is practice. It’s hard
to ﬁgure out what personal satis-
faction the runners get when they
have to work the year around for

to the team and

a few brief ﬁings in the spring.

For Pitt’s trackmen, it appears
. that it's a case of all work and no
play. They deserve a better break.

Maior Sport?

Track at Pitt was always classed
as amajor sport until recent years.

 

Gosu, Do we wave r
AT PITT 3’ "—\

1 -s-_.
r.

   

   

Olson has turned out some of the
nation’s top tracksters. But now,
track has been relegated ‘to a
minor role--and it shouldn’t be.

Even though the thinclads don’t
get much of a chance to perform,
Pitt has a pretty good crop of
trackmen, all things considered.
Certainly they should be given the
chance to show what they can do
before home fans.

It’s probable that many of the
top runners in the district are
avoiding Pitt. If you were a track
star and had the choice of coming
to Pitt or going to a school that
gives track a decent break, you
wouldn’t pick Pitt.

One thing is sure-—Pitt
track needs a shot in the arm.
Let’s hope that shot is forth-
coming by next season——a bet-
ter schedule and more home
meets. ‘

Sigma Chi staged a rousing

ning after two men were retired
to edge Theta Chi, 11-10, at Ells-
worth Center Tuesday.

Pitt’s swimmer Torn Blosser
was the Sig hero. His long
home run with two on was the
straw that broke the Thetas’
backs. The undefeated Sigma
Chi’s had to overcome a six-run
bulge Theta Chi had run up in
the ﬁrst three innings, principal-
ly on the sharp, timely singles of
leadoff batter, Tommy J anosik.

Neither pitcher Ralph Henry of
the victors nor Paul Harnack of
the losers was impressive, each
experiencing trouble with his con-
trol, although both hurlers went
the entire distance.

Two Matches

The Panther netmen seek to
continue their quest of an all-win-
ning season as they meet Bucknell
at Lewisburg, this afternoon and
Penn State at State College to-
morrow.

They started off in the right
manner when they blanked Beth-
any, 9-0, on the loser’s courts last
Tuesday.

Pitt’s claim to tennis fame in the
East, John Lohstoeter, shut his'op—
ponent out in straight sets 6-0, 6-0,

as did Dave Lichtman.
. Match Highlight
Lohstoeter’s single contest with

State’s number one man, Owen
Landon, should be one of the high-

ed one of the best racquet-wielders
in the East.

One of the Panther losses last
year was at the hands of Penn
State, ﬁve matches to four, so
gthey will be out to avenge this
loss.

l Other singles winners in the
: Bethany match besides Lohstoeter
and Lichtman were Harry Camp-
ney, Earl Roof, Joe Bendel, and

Bob Ilisevich.

Three Purposes

The purpose of the workshop
is three-fold. It gives student
writers a chance to have their
work produced, it gives student
directors an opportunity of stag-
ing a play, and it gives actors
more chance to practice.

The director of the workshop
is Kenneth Edgar, lecturer in
speech.

The workshops ﬁrst offerings
were given at the beginning of
April. At that time three original
one-act plays were presented.

After seeing the plays, Harvey
Pope, director of Pitt Players,
said, “I think the ﬁrst production
of the workshop was a very ﬁne

beginning for this project.”

Potential Pittites Given

Glimpse of College Life:

By LOIS FOIGHT
Exchange Editor

“Informality” has been the keynote of the success of
Pitt’s Public Relations program. This program is bringing:
high school seniors to the University for a glimpse of student
life throughout April, and the ﬁrst week in May. ‘

Unnoticed by many students, boy

of the city and outlying districtd
high schools have toured "the Ca-
thedral in small groups, heard
talks by members of the faculty
and administrative staff, and metl
student leaders in the tuck shops
over cokes provided by the Uni-
versity.

‘These visiting groups have been
arranged by J. Edgar Ricart, as-
sistant dean of men, with the aid
of student committees and volun-
teers. Dr. Stanton C. Crawford,
dean of the College, is general
chairman.

A typical visit begins at 2 p.m.
with an introductory welcome by
Mr. Ricart, and an opening talk
by a member of the faculty or ad-
ministration. Here, reasons why
college study is important, prob-
lems of ﬁnance and application}
procedure, and opportunities for
social life at Pitt are reviewed.

For about an hour following this
talk, small groups tour the build- ,
ing guided by student hosts and,
hostesses.

Peggy Cochran is in charge of

i
These informal groups may do:

ality rooms, dean of men’s and
women’s ofﬁces, views from the
36th ﬂoor, libraries, classrooms
and tuck shops may be points of
interest on the tour. ,

According to Mr. Ricart, stress‘
is on doing the things visiting stu-
dents are interested in. An in-
formal talk in the Commons Room
or in the 8th ﬂoor lounge may take
the place of an extended tour.

At 3:30 p.m. all visitors meet —in
the Red Tuck shop for a free coke
and an opportunity to meet repre- .
sentatives from all of the under-
graduate schools.

Student representatives of ac-
tivitiesand organizations are on
hand also to meet the guests and
explain any problems or questions 2
they may have.

Lecturer Go

Many-Sided

ldsmith Has
Outlook

By ED JENSEN
Assistant Editor
Albert R. Goldsmith, lecturer in the Fine Arts Depart-

ment, is eight Mozart records

richer today.

Mr. Goldsmith, who regards Mozart as more than just
a great composer, was presented the records by nine of his

ﬁne arts students. They were

expressing their appreciation

guiding them through a tour of
the art -galleries of Washington
and Baltimore last February.
Mr. Goldsmith, however, is not
just a tourist guide with a special
interest in art galleries. At the
moment he is on the ﬁne arts staff.
Worked in Intelligence
During the last war he worked

Economic Warfare as an econo-
mist. Later he moved over to the
State Department where he work-
ed in the Office of Intelligence Re-
search.

After the war Mr. Goldsmith de—

received his M.A. in 1937. He is
still'working on it, but he attrib-
utes his apparent slowness to his
topic.

He ‘thinks” he selected a topic

expected. It concerns the History
o,f\Scientiﬁc and Learned Socie-
ties in the 18th Century.
The ‘Universal Man’

Aside from his work on his de— '
gree and his teaching here at Pitt,
Mr. Goldsmith has plenty of oth-
er interests to take up his time.

M ay 1 Deadline for Applications
For Endowed Scholarships -

The deadline for applications for endowed scholarships
is May 1, according to Lester G. Brailey, assistant dean of

ing interest in geology into a hob-
by.

A versatile musician, Mr. Gold-
smith plays the piano_ the ﬂute,
the harpsicorc‘ and the harp. He
has also composed several ballets
and instrumentals for string in-
struments. One of the ballets was
presented at Syria Mosque a few
years ago.

After music the intellectual
history of the arts is another side-
line study. Mr. Goldsmith has
attempted to trace the inﬂuence
of art on man and society.

A modern linguist of more than
average facility, he has mastered
the dilﬁcult Malayan language
and has some knowledge of most
of the Slavic tongues. His skill
with the Malay language was good
enough to get him a job offer as
cultural attache in Java.

Painting, Sculpture First Love

But Mr. Goldsmith always re-
turns to his ﬁrst love, painting and
sculpture. He is especially inter-
ested in portraiture art in both
mediums.

No man in an ivory tower, the
fine arts lecturer has pursued a
variety of mundane pursuits. He
has worked as an apple-picker on
farms in Virginia and Ohio. Last
spring he wa: employed by the
census bureau as an enumerator
in the Hill District and Mt_ Leba-
non.

Right now, he is faculty advisor
to the Fine Arts Society on campus
and to Alpha Phi Omega, hon-
orary service fraternity for men.

‘men.

It will be increasingly difﬁcult
for students to be given scholar-
ships next year, he pointed out,
because of two reasons. First,
there are twice as many applica-
tions as there are graduating
seniors on scholarships.

The second reason is that, since
the amount of the principle in
each fund is relatively ﬁxed,
making the interest ﬁxed, the in-
crease in tuition makes it inevi-
table that the number of scholar-
ships be reduced?

Brailey also said that it is now
apparent that there will be no
money in the scholarship fund for
summer school students.

These scholarships are judged
on the student’s need, citizenship,
and academic standing.

The Dean of Men awards about
35 scholarships each year.
