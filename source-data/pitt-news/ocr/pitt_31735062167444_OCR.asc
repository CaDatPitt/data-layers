Guerilla

} Theatre
Explained

The guerilla Theatre has two
objectives; to agitate the public
and wake-up the establishment.
Largely an experimental group,
the members of the theatre don’t
want to shock the people as much
as educate them.The way of life
of different groups will be expos-
ed: students and religious and na-
tionality groups in every section
of Pittsburgh, not just Oakland.

Political ideas are the tools, not
formal theatre training. It’s a pol-
itical street play that can be done
in two ways. First, it can be im-
promptu, so that no one else
knows its a play except the play-
ers.

For example, there could be two
people on an elevator in a very
heated discussion. At the peak of
the arguement, they leave the ele-
vator while the people are still
thinking about the, problem and
it’s solution.

The product of the play —— in-
stant concern by otherwise apathe-
tic people.

Second, it could be formal. Pos-
ters and other methods of adver-
tising could be used to promote
the play. It could be an organ-
ized play on the street, but it
would still have the political un-
dertones. Each form is used by
the players to educate the public
as well as entertain them.

The group meets every Monday
night at 8 p.m. in the Bellefield
Church. Anyone is free to join.
Acting experience is not neces-
sary, only the desire to expose
what the people of Pittsburgh
are not seeing the truth

 

Nazi Phenomenon

Cited by Dr. Peikoff,

Obj ectivist Lecturer

by BRUCE LEVEN SON

“The power that moves men is
the power of ideas,” said Dr. Leo-
nard Peikoff via tape transcription
last Friday evening in the first
lecture of four on “Nazism and
Contemptorary America.”

The lecture series is sponsored
by the Nathaniel Branden Insti-
tute, the organization founded by
philosopher Ayn Rand that ex-
pounds her philosophy of objec-
tivism. This lecture series exam-
ines the basic principles of Naz-
ism and similar philosophies like
Facism and Communism and com-
pares them to our present—day so-
ciety in the United States. The
first lecture explained the funda-
mentals of Nazism and how it was
able to grow in twentieth century
Germany.

“How did the Nazi phenomenon
happen?” asked Dr. Peikoff. How
did a twentieth century, civilized,
industrialized country with a con-
stitutional government become to-
atlitarian and its people submis-
sive robots‘?

Nazism showed the “decisive
role of philosophy in determining
man’s fate,” according to the lee-
turer. Their philosophy of Hitler
was one that the German people
readily followed, allowing the
Fuehrer to gain his absolute pow-
er. It is significant that Hitler did
not have to use force to obtain
control. He did not set up bar-
bed wire fences and the German
people were always free to leave
the country if they wished.

The state was to have absolute
control of the citizens. “The doc-

Police Reveal Student Hatred

by PEGGY ALLEN

“I hate students who demand a
say in things. Kill’em all. Draft
card burners should be shot on
the spot.”

This was the typical reaction
of many of the North Side Police
when asked their opinion of Col-
lege students and student power.
Most felt a bitter resentment to-

ward the student power move-
ment. “Students are there to
learn, not to question their profes-
sors. ” said one. “Somebody should

Cha.ngesMadeInPolitical

  Science Department

by VIRGINIA JOYCE

The Political Science Department of the University will undergo changes during the Fall Term in
two aspects: Department location and personnel.

Dr. Holbert Carroll, retiring chairman of the department, predicted that by December, the depart-
ment will have vacated its present headquarters on the 23rd floor of the Cathedral. Two old insurance build-
ings recently purchased by the University will accommodate several relocating departments besides Politi-
cal Science. The others include Sociology, Economics and the Graduate School of Library Sciences.

Located near the University Club, the buildings will provide seminar rooms, ample office space and
air conditioning. There will be no conventional-type classrooms.

A special feature of the new location will be an IBM 360 Terminal linked to the Computer Center
on the seventh floor of the Cathedral. This system will be available for both undergraduate and graduate
use in Political Science. Among its functions will be tabulation of election results and public opinion
statistics.

trine was that the group is the
unit of reality . . .
can be sacrificed for the group,”
Dr. Peikoff pointed out. This phi-
losophy is called collectivism. I
clearly denies the importance of
the individual. It also denounced
material needs. The needs of the
group or collective are the only
needs that count.

How could these people give up

feels that three
were mainly responsible for the
rise of Nazism. The lecturer has
called Plato, Kant, and Hegel
“the intellectual builders of Aus-
chwitz.”

Plato called reality non-materi-
al in nature. He felt that concrete
things were not really real. He or-
iginated the “organic Theory of
the state.” He considered the state
an organism; the individuals the
cells of the organism. This state,
Plato thought, should have unlim-
ited power and be ruled by a
special elite - the philosophers.

Emmanuel Kant was the most
influential German philosopher.
He felt that true reality was un-
knowable to reason, intellect, or
the mind. Faith - not reason - is
the only way to learn reality, ac-
cording to Plato.

Hegel, Dr. Peikoff called “post-
Kantian Platininist.” He stated the
world consisted of a single spiri-
tual mind called “the absolute.”
He saw no differentiation be-
tween people and things. All is ul-
timately one, according to Hegel.
He felt that collectivism (the

, state) is theclosest we as indi-

 
  
   
  
   
 
   
   
     

 

New additions to the profession-
al staff will ”strengthen the in-
ternational relations offerings of
the Political Science Depart-
ment,” promised Dr. William J.
Keefe, new department chairman.

Within this field, Stephen Ro-
sen, currently working on his Ph.
D. at the University of Syracuse,
will concentrate on the theoreti-
cal aspects of international re-
lations. He has published a piece
on the topic, Alliances in World
Politics.

Another newcomer will be Dr.

A Robert S. Walters, who will teach

courses this September centered
on international politics and or-
ganizations and Soviet-Commun-
ist affairs. Walters received his
Ph.D. in 1967 from the University
of Michigan.

ing will supplement the staff of
international relations experts,

viduals could get to reality. He-
gel also felt that the state should
be ruled by a special elite because
some people are closer to the ab-
solute than others.

These three philosophies were
incorporated into Hitler’s Na-
zism. Hitler felt that superior
races should rule over inferior ra-
ces; and superior men should rule
over inferior men. He told the
German people that their collec-
tive will could only be expressed
through the Fuehrer who repre-
sented that will. He felt that Ar-
yans were the chosen race.

The Nazi epistimology held that
reason isfault. Something is more
important—passion. The Nazis con-
stantly derided the mind. “They
characteristically lauded action a-
gainst thought,” said Dr. Peikoff.

The ethics of Nazism placed al-
truism before egosim. Nazism re-
quired altrusim so that the Ger-
man people would be willing to
sacrifice themselves to the state.
They felt that the common good
was more important than the pri-

  
 
  
  
 
  
   
  
  
   
  
 
  

 

Formosa, his position here as ex-
pert on Communist China will be
filled by William F. Dorrill, Dor-
ill comes to the University as a
visiting associate professor. His
specific field is leadership and suc-
cession in Communist China.

Both Dr. Keefe, new depart-
ment chairman, and Dr. Carroll,
who is retiring from that position,
took a minute out to briefly evalu-
ate the department.

Dr. Keefe believes that the Uni-
versity’s Political Science is
“growing in all fields. The only
area that we needed to streng-
then was the international rela-
tions field and we’ve done that
through the high quality of the
recent appointments.”

Dr. Carroll had more to say.
Although admitting that he may
be “prejudiced,” Carroll termed
the department “excellent.” He
quoted statistics to support the
boast. _

“The Political Science Depart-

ment has the largest number of ‘

majors of the Social Sciences,” he
declared. “Of the total of 38 ma-
jor departments of the Universi-
ty, we have the fourth highest nu-
mber of majors - 350 at that mo-
ment.”

“This department is a good
teaching department,” he contin-
ued, “Its members give atten-
tion both to the undergraduate
and undergraduate levels.

vate good. They repudiated pride
and egoism. Even their educa-
tional system reflected this philo-
sophy. The young Germans were
taught to love their country and
be willing to sacrifice themselves
to its causes. Nazism would hav
been impossible in a society of eg-
oists, according to Dr. Peikoff.

Dr. Peikoff also said that al-
truism is fundamentally a Chris-
tian doctrine and “Christianity
made Nazism possible.”

Hitler himself was a “selfless
man,” an altruist, the lecturer
pointed out. The Fuehrer was un-
interested in material pleasures;
money, women, or liquor. He was
also a vegetarian. He lived for
power — for what he could do to
others. He succeeded in making
his followers altruists.

The Nazis were‘ also “ethical
relativists.” They believed that
there were no absolutes in ethics.
“Right was whatever was good
for the German people,” said Dr.
Peikoff.

Ethical relativism and altrusim

no discipline. Take’em to the
wood shed, I say. Any intelligent
American will agree with me.”

The Dolice felt that students
have no right to determine what
courses be offered. “Why all this
talk about Negro History cour-
ses?” one asked. “There are no
niggers worth studying.”

Most seemed to feel that Stu-
dent Power advocates were dan-
gerous subversives. “You’re all
Commies.” insisted one officer.
“First overthrow the universities,
then the United State govern-
ment.” “Yeah,” added another,
“If you don’t like it here, try Rus-
sia. They won’t let you students
get away with anything over there.
They know how to handle their
students.”

None of you kids are satisfied
with things.” said a desk sarge—
ant. “Twenty years ago, we re-
spected our parents, our country
and God. I loved my mother. Ev-
erything was alright with Ameri-
ca then. But no, you students have
to cause trouble.” This officer al-
so felt that students were to blame
for the Pittsburgh riots last spring.
“Those niggers were just trying
to immitate you student punks.”

“You should be grateful for
your education.We fought World
War II for you kids. And we
wanted to fight. Now, you kids
don’t even want to fight for us.”

“You students are just like Mar-
tin Luther King. He said he was
non-violent, but he was really a
commie. I saw a picture of King
in a communist class. That proves
it,” said another officer.

When asked their opinions of
the riot at Pitt last spring, most
felt that it was handled correctly.
“There are no onlookers at a riot,”
said one. “Anyone standing a-
round has a right to be arrested.”
Another felt that “Posvar should
be shot for the way he criticized
the police. We had a right to be
there.”

   

are paradoxical. How did the
Nazis clarify this paradox?

Dr. Peikoff will explain how
this paradox was justified in the
next lecture which will be held
July 12. In that lecture and the
two concluding lectures, Dr. Pei-
koff will draw parallels between
Nazism and contemporary Ameri-
ca. The next lecture will be held
at the Webster Hall Hotel, Fifth
and Dithridge Streets, in Oakland,
at 8 P.M. Admission is $3. Free ‘
parking will be provided by the
Mellon Bank office across the
street from the hotel.

A Responsibility
New Education

by PAUL STOLLER, Editor

“The white man’s heaven is the black man’s hell. And
today blacks live in a hell that is closed off from the white
né3n’s vision. It is the hell of rejection, frustration, and hat-
1' .

This aura of hatred, refection, and frustration is not at
all far fetched; it is not an unreasonable thesis. Nor, is it a
result of distorted remarks from militant blacks. This is the
racial climate in the nation and on this campus. But whites in
the United States and especially on this campus just don’t

.s realize the cause of the harsh feelings of the
Black Community.

The black man has been a slave in the
United States for almost 200 years. And while
the Emancipation Proclamation supposedly
. freed the black slaves 100 years ago, the black
man is still chained to the antiquated tenets
I of our society. He has been continuously sub-

STOLLER jected by a white power structure that fails
to realize the actual definition of equality. That power struc-
ture is somewhat. fearful of permitting the black man to fin-
ally gain an equal footing on the elevated steps that lead to
individual success and self-realization.

This same power structure deters itself from molding a
just society by virtue of its perceptions. White people believe
that the “Negro” is an inferior being. Blacks have been char-
acterized as being lazy and unmotivated.

The color of black, moreover, is perceived as being evil
and, it follows, that many whites believe that the black man is
bad or hostile. He is a hardened criminal and a ruthless kil-
ler. The responsibility for crimes falls completely on the
“Negro.”

Most whites maintain that they are for civil rights. But
these “Charley Liberals” reject open housing. They fear the
value of their property will deteriorate when blacks move into
the neighborhood. In the same vain, many whites refuse to
swim together with blacks. The water in the swimming pool
will become dirty if a black person dives into the pool.

Whites will argue that these thoughts simply don’t exist.
But, if they don’t exist why is their squalor, disease, and
hunger in the ghetto? Why do whites move out of their
neighborhoods when blacks move in ?

The answer to these questions lies in the fact that whites
subjectively believe that the black man is inferior. And the
majority of whites are unable to discard this sick perception’.

The problems involved in achieving racial equality will
not be solved by whites helping blacks. The black man must
raise himself up to the position of having pride in his be-
ing black, and pride can only be achieved by the means of
self analysis and self-help.

It is the task of the “mass media” to use its talents to
vividly paint the pictures of the black man’s problems, frustra-
tions, and demands. Whites must educate whites on matters
concerning the life and role of black man in this our complex
and confused society. The misperceptions of ‘ the white man
must be redirected if this nation is to survive the pangs of ra-
cial bitterness and unrest.

   
  
 
  
  
  
  

 

C-———From The End Of The Bar
Politically Speaking: How Far
Behind Times Is Pittsburgh?

by GEORGE LIES
Associate Editor
A national political writer recently said that
young people, thwarted because of the assassina-
tion of Senator Robert F. Kennedy, should now
turn their eyes and their work toward politics at a
local level.

“They should try to elect young, reform mayors
and councilmen, school directors, governors, legis-
lators, congressmen, sena- .
tors, courthouse officials,
and judges,” he claimed.

“They could have a ter-
rific impact in local gov-
ernment,” he asserted.

If his words were put
into action, Pittsburgh and
the surrounding Western  ,
Pennsylvania area would
be a different place. For C“ LIES
one thing, the common folk would finally feel that
their voice would be heard.

Right now, this is impossible.

The Pittsburgh government is so entrenched
in the haunts of an Old Democratic machine that
it is not even enough to say that its conservative
movements are pathetic.

The Democrats’ oft—believed creed is that they
stand for the common man. What has happened to
Pittsburgh then in the past 20 years?

Pittsburgh is supposed to be in a period of Ren-
aissance. Physically, this is apparent.

Emotionally and psychologically, it isn’t.

Pittsburgli’s government, wallowing in its con-
servative quagmire, offers nothing to its people.

The theatrical agencies and other civic-minded
people have tried to offer excitement, beauty, and

But then look at Northside, and I dont just

mean Manchester. Then take a peek at South-
side. Is‘ it stagnant . . . much? Is the Pittsburgh
government, headed by Mayor Joseph Barr, doing
anything about this nothingness?

In November, Pennsylvania will choose a sena-
tor. Whether it is Joseph Clark . . . again . . . or not
will be up to Dick Schweiker.

Is it time for a change to young politicians, be
they Democrats or Republicans.

Congressman Schweiker, a young progressive
thinking man, is running for Clark’s senate seat.
It is the Old vs The New.

Many Pennsylvanians admittedly are tired of
Sen. Clark. Schweiker knows he has the anti-Clark
sentiment going for him, and he “makes no bones
about it.”

But the man also has something else going for
him . . . his ideas.

“When Sen. Clark sees a problem, he pours‘

money all over. This is old fashion,” Schweiker
says.

“You can’t subsidize a man all his life,” he
continued, referring to the poor who are on wel-
fare. “Give him a low-rent mortgage, give him an
opportunity and not a handout, train him, and make
a capitalist out of him.”

“Sen. Clark is the epitome of those who see a
problem and then ask the federal government to do
something about it,” says Schweiker, a Republican
moderate. “These programs are self—perpetuating. ”

Pittsburgh is self—perpetuating.

Maybe it is time for a change here, as well as
in the senate.

But that is just as much up to the young people,
as it is the to the common folks.

by BRUCE LEVEN SON

I was always the worst student
in my Saturday school class.
“Learn about the Jewish people.
Know your heritage.” Big deal.
I wasn’t even sure if I believed
in God.

Two consecutive years-not one,
but two (“Oh my son flunked
God,” my mother would shriek)
—— I failed Saturday school and
went to summer school. That’s
right! Summer school for relig-
ious school. And Mr. Nathan was
there every year — Big, long, slin-
ky pipe in his mo uth, sneering at
us. “Boy,” he’d address me, “Why
aren’t you working& Done!& You
can’t be done. You were done all
year, that’s why you’re here now.”

Fact is I just didn’t give a

damn. Why should I have to go
to Saturday school? I got up ear-
ly five days a week to go to re-
gular school. You can’t make me
get up early on Saturday, too, and
spend another lousy dan in shcool.
It’s not fair! Hell, Saturday
school doesn’t count. You think
college is going to look at your
Saturday school record? “Sorry
son,’but you’ve been rejected.
You have a B average for high
school but you flunked God
twice.”

“If you don’t remember any-
thing else,” Mr. Shratter used to
say (I had him twice and flunk-
ed both times), “Remember how
the Jews have been persecuted.
Remember how we’ve been kick-
ed out of all the European coun-
tries.”

Funny thing is, I do remember

1492—Co1umbus discovered Am-
erica? — wrong — Jews kicked out
of Spain. We’d lived there for
God knows how many years, es-
tablished our homes there, some
of us became leading citizens,
built businesses, generations and
generations . . . . “Get out, Kike,
infidel! You’re not wanted.” In-
quisition, goodbye! — 1492.

And then there was France and
Portrgal and Germany and some
African -nation (Morocco may-
be).

As recently as 1940 too! We
were as German as sour kraut.
Assimilated. Germans before we
were Jews. “Get lost or it will
be charcoal broiled kosher meat
over a hot stove.”

Yes, I remember. I know my
heritage well.

Named To US.
Olympic High
Altitude Team

Jerry Richey, finishing fifth
just one second behind the
leader, Villanova’s Dave Pat-
rick in the trials of the 1500
meters, was named Monday to
the U. S. Olympic high-alti-
tude training team.

Subsequently. the final 1968
U.S. Olympians will be chosen
from this group.

Patrick won the 1500 event in
3:43.2, followed by Kent State’s
Sam Bair at 3:43.15, and Patrick’s
teammate Marty Liquori.

The high - altitude training
team, preparing for Mexico City
in the fall, will train from Aug-
ust to early September.

In the final test, at that time,
the top three athletes in each
event will be chosen. Ailing Jim
Ryun, who is expected to run in
the 1500. did not compete against
the qualifiers but he may in the
finals.

In Saturday’s first round qual-
ifiers, Richey finished at 3:46.8
in the 1500. He placed fifth in
his heat behind Bair. John Mason
of Fort Hayes State won the trial
with a 3:45.2, while Patrick won
his hdat in 3:462.

“He has a decent chance to
make the final cut,” said Sports
Information Director Dean Bil-

ACLU Makes Statement on Student Riots

This statement was ‘made by the
American Civil Liberties Union
criticizing students, faculties, and
administration.

Recent demonstrations, strikes,
sit-ins and other outbreaks on col-
lege campuses in various parts of
the United States are evidence of
a serious malaise in American
academic life as well as in the so-
ciety at large. Their causes are
complex and involve other groups
in the university besides the stu-
dents, so that they cannot simply
be dismissed as due to immatur-
ity, alienation, irresponsibility or
conspiracy.

On many campuses there have
been grave violations of the prin-
ciples of sound academic gover-
nance by administrations which
have denied students reasonable
participation in matters of univer-
sity policy in which their inter-
ests have been clearly involved,
by faculties which have been in-
different to the needs and aspir-
ations of students, and by students
who by various actions have in-
terfered with the processes of
teaching, learning and the right
to free speech. The values of aca-
demic freedom associated with
these processes are as relevant
in monents of stress as in normal
times, and connot be suspended
for however worthy a carse with-
out doing serious or irreparable
damage to them.

In some cases the police have
been called in under circum-
stances reflecting a complete
breakdown in the internal disci-
pline of the university. The in-
vitation of civil authorities onto
the campus endangers the auto-
nomy of the institution, and
should be restored to only when
all other avenues have failed and
then preferably under strict pro-
cedural rules laid down and
agreed to by administration, fac-
ulty and students.

police actions the formulation of
such rules appears to be a mat-
ter of urgent priority. While any
group sufficiently bent on dis-
ruption can presumably force an
intervention of this kind, such
groups generally represent a
small minority among the students
and would not be likely to sue-
ceed in large - scale actions on
campuses where there was a man-
ifest unity of interest among fac-
ulty, students and administration.

The manner in which demon-
strations have been conducted, at
least in some notorious c a s e s ,
must be condemned as dispropor-
tionate to the grievances of the
students and as categorically in
violation of basic principles of
academic freedom. The fact that
significant reforms may be won
by violent action does not justify
the resort to violence, even if such
action seems plausible to some in
a society marked by violence both
internally and in its external ac-
tions, and even if an apparent jus-
tification after the fact seems to
be provided by a violent response,
for example a police action. The
so-called “politics of confronta-
tion” invites, and is intended to
invite, such a response, but in so
far as it seeks its ends by means
which infringe on the liberties of
others it is out of keeping with
the principles by which and the

purposes for which the universi.

It must be admitted that an ex-
amination of the conditions which
have triggered demonstrations
shows that in a majority of cases
students have had a prima facie
justification for their concern, if
not for their manner of express-
ing it.They have protested against
compulsory ROTC (Tuskegee),
the suspension of politically ac-
tive students (Stanford), the ne-
glect of Negro students (North-
western), alleged mistreatment of
controversial faculty m e m b e r s
(Roosevelt), the use of slum park-
land for a university facility and
the university’s ties with defense-
related research (Columbia).

The list could be prolonged.
T h e s e causes a r e of unequal
weight and have sometimes been
used, even by students without
political or ideological commit-
ments, as excuses for the expres-
sion of more fundamental hostil-
ities, reflecting among other
things a widespread frustration
and disillusionment with the for-
eign and domestic policies of the
present government. But the fact
that local pretexts have been so
easily come by is no more to be
overlooked than the problem of
war and race which have set the
stage for so many of these epi-
sodes.

The internal conditions point-
ed to by the frequently and inten-
sity of these disturbances can best
be represented as a progressive
neglect of certain principles (full

and a rigorous-priority of aca-
demic and human considerations
over financial and organizational
ones) together with a change in
the nature of the student body
and its relations with faculty and
administration, a change of which
the latter groups have hardly been
aware.

Three aspects of this change,

familiar enough in isolation but
rarely considered together, are the
demographic shift to a younger
population, the extension of the
period of formal training and
therefore of dependence, and the
lowering of the age of social ma-
turity.

The passivity of many faculties
has allowed most of the power
in the university to pass into the
hands of the administration, and
the administration has been only
too ready to accept this power.
