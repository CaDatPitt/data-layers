Governance Budgets Increase $3,000 Next Year

By MARGI STUMPF
V Pitt News Staff Writer

If approved, 1979-80 budgets for
the Student Government Board’s
seven governance groups and for
next year's Greek Week will exceed
the total amount the organizations
received this year by $3,219.35.

According to SGB Allocations
Committee chairman Mike Seitz, a
total of $30,772.32 has been
recommended for allocation to
Black Action Society, Greek Week,
Interfraternity Council, Inter-
Honorary Council, Engineering
Student Cabinet, Panhellenic
Association, Nursing Students
Organization and the Resident
Students Association.

Last year the groups received
$27,552.97. Although the total
amount represents an increase, all
of the groups submitting budgets
for Allocations Committee review
have had their requests cut.

Taking the largest cut was IFC,
which requested $26,724.40, Seitz
said. Only $5,100.00 was recom-
mended by allocations after a
100-page IFC budget was scrutin-
ized, he added.

“Never in my life have I seen a
budget like that,” Seitz stated. “It
was well-detailed and well-ration-
alized, but extremely long."

Seitz said cuts were made in
IFC’s budget because “we can’t

Intern Program To Create Sense of ‘Community’

By SUE McFARLAND

Pin News Staff Writer

The Office of Residence Life is
planning to institute a resident
intern program in Holland Hall and
Tower B next fall, according to Tim
Snyder, assistant director of the
office.

The resident interns will be

Push Draft,
Spark Debate

By TOM ONIEAL

A national debate on renewal of

— the military draft is developing.

Several bills have been introduced

in the House and Senate to begin
draft registration.

News Analysis

The debate centers on whether »

the “All Volunteer Force” is
working and whether, without
advance registration, the Selective
Service System can deliver draftees
soon enough to meet Pentagon
mobilization requirements.

President Jimmy Carter has not
asked for draft registration funds in
his 1980 budget, but the chairman
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the
secretary of the Army have urged
draft registration.

Opposition to the draft grew
steadily during the Vietnam War.
The peak of that opposition came in
1971, when Congress reluctantly
voted to extend the induction
authority to July 1, 1973. Six

and the Resident Student Asso-
ciation floor representatives to
create a better sense of “com-
munity” on the floors. Appli-
cations for these non-salaried
positions will be available begin-
ning next week, with the deadline
being March 28.

According to Synder, the intern
program was patterned after the
mentor program, a volunteer group

of peer counselors for incoming 9

freshmen created by the Office of
New Student Programs.

Snyder said the interns will not
have the responsibilities of re-
porting their actions to his office
nor will they be assigned speciﬁc
duty hours as the resident
assistants are.

He added that the intern position
could act as a stepping stone for
students interested in eventually
applying for the resident assistant

positions, but stressed that interns
will not automatically be selected
as resident assistants.

“We don't choose every frater-
nity president or student leader
just on the basis of his accomplish-
ments in other areas,” Snyder
said.

Students chosen for the intern
program will be required to take a
university-sanctioned course titled,

which will be taught by Snyder.
“We don’t see this position as
standing between the students and
the RAs but rather as a kind of
triangle, with the two working
together as a team,” Snyder said.

Snyder said he hopes the
program will eventually become
self-sustaining, with the members
teaching, training and, selecting
new members for the group.

Penn State
Follows Pitt
Housing Plan

Housing officials at Penn State
University opted for the first come,
first served method
selection this year (the method
recently discarded at Pitt).

The result of this decision was
5,700 students standing in line for
more than 21 hours before housing
applications were accepted.

M. Lee Upgraft, director of
Residence Life at Penn State,
explained a housing situation there
that is very similar to Pitt’s. At the
University Park campus, there-‘are
a total of 12,700 spaces available
for resident students with 7,000 of
these spaces allotted for returning.
upperclassmen. Four thousand
spaces are allotted for incoming
freshmen, and 1,500 spaces for
transfer students from Common-
wealth campuses. Last year,
approximately 1,000 students were
denied on-campus housing.

In past years only those students
who wished to change their room
assignment were required to gain a
place at the front of the line to
assure themselves a room.

Students began congregating at
10 p.m. late Tuesday night, and by

F. Scott Fitzgerald and Ernest Hemingway had
their share of tumdowns by publishers and Emily
Dickinson didn't even have a work published
before her death. But they never threw temper
tantrums (in public anyway). At Pitt, things are
different. It seems a student had a work of
poetry turned down at one of the campus
magazines located in the Student Union and
promptly vented his anger on the person
responsible for his rejection. He could have
been charged with assault, but fled before cam-
pus police arrived at Schenley.Hall.

Governance Groups To GetMore In 1980

(Continued from page I )

afford to give $26,000.” Funds
were allocated in areas that
supported the organization’s func-
tion, which is to recruit members,
he added.

Black Action Society also re-
ceived a substantial cut in their
funding request, having nearly
$17,000 sliced off their $23,095
submitted budget.

Emphasis was placed on
“massive” programming in the
group’s budget, Seitz said, and the
$6,546 recommended by allocations
is to go to “good, solid programs.”

Some of the programs approved
by allocations include an appear-

ance by the Rev. Jesse Jackson
during Black Week, a poetry forum
and a Gospel Night, also held
during Black Week. Seitz said the
Gospel Night has “traditionally
high attendance and is traditionally
successful. ’ ’

The committee also axed a large
‘amount of BAS requested funds
because the group receives approx-
imately $24,000 per year from the

‘ university for operating costs.

“I can’t see student government
(additionally) funding them when
they (already) get money,” Seitz
said, noting BAS is the only
governance group that receives
funds from the university budget.

RSA had more than $9,000
trimmed from their budget
request, with only $1,900.00 of
$10,956.07 recommended by allo-
cations.

The request was cut, Seitz
stated, because of an item listed in
the Allocations Committee’s poli-
cies and procedures manual.

The item stipulates that any
organization, receiving funds for
programs that show a profit must
return all proceeds to allocations
accounts.

RSA included in its budget
several money-making programs,
Seitz said, that would require the

group to return all proceeds to
allocations.

He used as an example an RSA
budget request of $100 to hire a
caricature artist to sketch students.
Fees for the portrait sittings would
bring in approximately $125, with
all of that amount returned to
allocations and RSA realizing no
profit on the effort, said Seitz.

“It is to RSA’s benefit not to ask
n'ioney for these programs,’ he
stated.

Seitz said allocations is working
during the 1979-80 budget hearings
with projected student activities
fees totalling $272,960, a decrease
of $12,000 over the $285,000
available this year.

Budget cuts like those made by
the committee for governance
groups would most likely not be
made if there were an increase in
either student enrollment or the
activities fee, he said.

An increase of only four
dollars-—from $12 to $16—in the
fee over attendance of 12,000
full-time undergraduates would
bring in roughly $100,000 in
additional funds for allocations,
according to Seitz.

As it stands now, he continued,
smaller groups, up for allocations
review over the next few weeks,
will feel the pinch from the lower
level of activities fees —funds.

Push For Draft Escalates To Meet Requirements

(Continued from page I )

months before that date, President
Nixon ended inductions. In 1975,
President Ford, committed to
making the All Volunteer Force
work, ended draft registration.

Since that time, the Selective
Service has been on “deep
standby”, reduced from an agency
that once employed 6,500 people
with a budget of $80 million, to a

budget of $6.8 million and 100
employees.

Of the four bills introduced in the
House, two would require women
to be registered. Women have
been enlisting in the All Volunteer
Force in record numbers and are
now considered to be a central part
of Pentagon planning.

According to a 1977 Brookings
Institute study on “Women and the
Military”: “Indeed, whether or

not this nation can sustain its
armed forces solely by voluntary
means could well depend on how
effectively the female labor re-
source is employed.”

Also given serious consideration
in Congress is universal and
compulsory national service for
men and women. This idea has
been raised and rejected many
times in Congress but has recently
attracted the support of some
members of Congress.

National service is seen as a way
to provide discipline, training and
service opportunities for youth, and
as a way to ﬁll active and reserve
military ranks, since military
service would be one option in a
compulsory system.

Compulsory national service has
two serious handicaps, the huge
cost (one estimate by the .Con-
gressional Budget Office is $23
billion) and the doubtful consti-

Wednesday instead of at 8 a.m. on
Thursday as originally planned.

Just as Pitt students protested
the institution of the lottery system
of room selection, Penn State
students opposed the first come,

One student was quoted in The
Daily Collegian (the student
newspaper at Penn State) as saying
the room selection process is a
“flamboyant display of mis-
management.’ ’

Studentswere cited as becoming

upset and impatient during their
day-long vigil to gain a room.

University officials said that few
problems were experienced with
the students waiting in line and
that most students were peaceful
and orderly. ’

ONE YEAR AGO

The familiar sound of rate increase was heard across Pitt’s
campus when William Markus, acting vice chancellor for student
affairs announced a controversial hike in housing fees for
students planning to live in Bruce Hall or Forbes Pavillion.
Meanwhile. Chancellor Posvar called the attitudes of some state
officials toward appropriations for state-related universities,
“reminiscent of the 19th century opposition to public secondary
education.” v

FIVE YEARS AGO

Joseph Spear, an investigative reporter for columnist Jack
Anderson, told students in the Kurtzman Ballroom that the FBI
keeps track of the lives of famous Americans by _maintaining
special classiﬁed ﬁles on them. Among those being “watched”
were Beaver Fall's own “Broadway” Joe Namath, former boxing
champion Joe Louis and actor Marlon Brando. Spear also
predicted that Richard Nixon would be impeached before the
Watergate investigation would be resolved.

TEN YEARS AGO

About 110 students from the School of "Pharmacy presented
Chancellor Posvar with a list of grievances, stating that The Pitt
News was guilty of: consistantly supporting only minority groups,
not being representative of the majority of Pitt students and being
run by a small clique of students, who constantly badger the
administration.

TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO

“Erin Go Bragh” and little green derbies were abundant during
the univérsity’s first Engineers Week.

The interpretation of “Erin Go Bragh,” according to these
students. was that St. Patrick was an engineer...and crowds of
theatergoers were cramming Oakland’s Schenley Theater to see
the hit, “Taza, Son of Cochise.”

Schweiker Introduces Federal Health Insurance Program

By The Associated Press
WASHINGTON—Pennsylvania
Senator Richard Schweiker has
proposed a privately-run national

A health insurance program as an

alternative to comprehensive nat-
ional health insurance plans.
Schweiker’s proposal, which he
said will be introduced as a bill
soon, would add private coverage

for catastrophic illness or injury
onto present medical plans.

A Schweiker aide said the plan is
a major part of what the senator
hopes to accomplish before leaving
office. Schweiker, ranking Repub-
lican on the Senate Human
Resourses Committee, has said he
intends to quit when his term
expires in 1980 to work for Ronald

Reagan's presidential campaign.

“Any kind of health care
program should include private
insurance and private delivery and
a minimum of government involve-
ment,” Schweiker said yesterday
at a luncheon meeting of the
Independant Insurance Agents of
America.

“Rarely have we seen inter-

vention by government result in
lower costs. In fact, quite the
opposite is true.”

National health insurance pack-
ages have been proposed by Sen.
Edward Kennedy, D-Mass. and the
Carter administration. While the
packages differ, each one provides
for federal government supervision
to insure universal coverage and
hold down costs.

Schweiker said such comprehen-
sive plans are unnecessary, be-
cause studies show 90 percent of
Americans already have some form
of medical insurance and most are

ance would pay care costs for
catastrophic illnesses or injuries.

Schweiker said he has yet tor

decide whether a catastrophe

should be measured by length of‘

disablility, total care cost, or salary
percentage needed to cover costs.

If a catastrophe medical plan
works, Schweiker said the govern-

ment could then work on upgrading -

the Medicaid program for the
elderly and working poor.
“Opponents are fighting cata-
strophic insurance tooth and nail
because they know once we have it,
there's no need for national health
insurance,” Schweiker said.

He added that a voluntary effort
by the health care industry has

With the establishment of a promotion campaign
by the University Placement Center, Pitt has the
dubious honor of being the first university in the
United States to try to sell its graduates to employers.
As center director Dan Nagy puts it, “We are trying
something here that has never been tried before, and
that’s basically to advertise.” A

workers this summer is just one example of this ab-
ject fear. - _ I-

While business as usual flourishes here, the aims
and purposes of a university seem to be forgotten.
The search for knowledge, the education of the
inquisitive young and the commitment to social
justice that have historically been the aims of univer-
sities seem to become incidental in the expansion of
slick sales methods and modern business practices.

Grads For
Sale

* There is nothing inherently evil about the’media
blitz that uses billboards, radio spots and television
public service announcements, but the program is
symbolic of an insidious development here. As Pitt
has grown, the university has become a major
business. From the beginning to the end of their
association with Pitt, students are exposed’ to the
modern marketing techniques with which university
bureaucrats are enthralled.

For example, Pitt has expanded the big money-
making disciplines such as the sciences and health-

tant departments decline. Administrators seem un—
concerned about the altruistic quest for knowledge
unless it shows a profit.

It is time we shake top administrators from their
world of ledgers, cost studies and slick budget
presentations. We must demand that the university
end its dabbling in business and return to the world
of‘ education. We can then turn into a university
community where students receive jobs because they
are the best in their field, not because an employer
heard on the radio, “We’ve got your people.”

Office of News and Publications, which churns out
reams of press releases that tell of the good things
happening here. When anything that could mar the

By LAURIE D. MANN

One cold winter morning over a
year ago now, I awoke and turned ‘

—-the TV on sleepily. Phil Donahue’s

face slowly came into focus,
although his words were very clear.
“And tell me, Mrs. Gabler, just
what do you find so objectionable

-about the dictionary?”

“Why Phil,” the matronly
woman said, “in Texas, -we found
39 words in our children’s school

.. dictionaries, which we consider

objectionable. We've helped put

..together a moral dictionary for

Texas youngsters.”

At this point, I decided I still had
to be asleep. This all had to be a
bizarre sort of nightmare—censor-
ing the dictionary in American

schools? It couldn’t be real...could
it? Sadly realizing I was awake, I
pulled out my journal and began
jotting notes about one of the most
frightening hours I ever spent
watching TV.

Mrs. Gabler and her husband

were debating the “m€rits" of‘

censorship with Professor Edward
-Jenkinson of the University of
Indiana-. The Gablers are at the
forefront of a movement to ban
what they consider to be the
“religion of humanism" in public
schools.

They believe that sex education,
books like “To Kill a Mockingbird”
(bec-ause it portrayed children
being disrespectful to their par-
ents), and evolution are the
“tenents” of this religion. They

want school subjects taught with a
fundamentalist Christian focus..
Although Professor‘ Jenkinson

seems to sh..re the opinion that

humanism is a religion, he is
adamantly against censorship.
Furthermore, he does not feel that
Christianity has any place in the
philosophy of public education.
Unlike the Gablers, Jenkinson has
the Constitution to support him.

If anything is “sacred" to me, it
is the Constitution. I am amazed
by the way people are attempting
to batter down the Constitution.
The concept of censoring dictionar-
ies in Texas public schools, and
replacing them with expurgated
versions does not seem to offend
many people.

If offends me because it is

  Making the Constitution Trivial

symtomatic of a much larger
problem. The problem -is more
than the current pervasion of
conservativism in America,
more than a return to religion. This
trend can constitute a real threat to
the Constitution.

Americans have long been
constitutionally illiterate. Pollsters
have presented average Americans
copies of the Bill of Rights, without
explaining what the document was.
Frequently, a majority of people
polled have labeled the Bill of
Rights a “radical” document. If a
national referendum were held, it
is likely that the Bill of Rights
would__be voted down.

Despite the fact that average
Americans do not know what the
Constitution says, there is a current
clamor for a Constitutional conven-
tion. Do they want to reaffirm

. human rights? No, they want to

trivialize the Constitution by
writing an amendment making a

’ balanced Federal budget manda-

tory. Some economists have said
that balancing the Federal budget
in this way is ﬁscally impossible.
But, a mandated balanced
budget could be the least of our

and r

problems if a ‘Constitutional con-
vention were called in the near
future. There is no responsible
plan for the selection of delegates
to such a convention. There -«is no
way to limit the topic of debate to
the budget issue. Any part of the
Constitution could be amended or
even discarded.

Anti-abortion delegates would
probably make a strong showing at
a future Constitutional convention.
They tried for years to call one, but
fell short by just a few states. Our
rewritten Constitution could in-
clude an amendment making
abortion illegal. Anita Bryant
could propose an anti-homosexual-
ity amendment. And supporters of
the Gablers could use such a
convention to rid public schools of
“evils” such as evolution, “bad”
books and sex education.

In these times, it is highly
unlikely that anything enlightening
or ennobling would come out of a
Constitutional convention. Thomas
Jefferson, John Adams and Ben-
jamin Franklin are all dead now. I
hope that our Constitution, long a
world model, won’t soon follow
them to a dark, silent grave.

Final Praise for the Alternative Curriculum Program

A disappointing end to the
Alternative Curriculum program
came on March 7 when the College
of Arts and Sciences Council
reversed an earlier decision and
terminated the program for incom-
ing freshmen that had been
initiated six years ago.

Having been a member of the
first Alternative Curriculum group
in the fall of 1973, I feel compelled
to speak out on the issue. Possibly
I should have expressed my opinion
sooner or done something about it
before, for now a program that was

' unique and important to the school

is no longer available.

During. the summer of 1973 I
received a letter concerning the
new alternative to the normal
regimented initiation into college.
Coming from he eastern part of the
state and unsure of my future as
well as my career plans, I joined
the 80 or so students who entered
the initial program.

Although the program was just
beginning, the professors guiding

the students were both optimistic
and hard working. Students were
able to freely choose any ﬁeld of
study that interested them. We
became acclimated to our new
surroundings and met many
friends quickly in the classroom-
free environment.

We were invited into the
professors’ homes for dinner and
stimulating conversation. With the
guidance of such professors as
John Townsend of the physics
department, David Brown of the
math department and Ed Ochester
of the English department, sudents
were able- to discover just what
their interests were before deciding
on a major. In this way they were
able to avoid changing majors and
the. frustration of disappointing
performance and wasting time.

In the program, students were
able to work hard in a stress free
situation, accept responsibilty and
subsequently enjoy learning. The
great rapport and interest shown
by the professors was also a unique

experience, which enabled one to
communicate with other insturctors
when they encountered difficulties
in their studies. A frequent and
important problem with students
today is a lack of communication
with their professors outside of
class time, resulting in less than
optimum results.

Now, however, the program is
gone. The reasons for it are many
but they are not complex. They
center around disinterest on the
part of both students and faculty.
It 15 difficult for teachers to spend
time in a program that receives
little positive reinforcement. It is
also a concern of incoming
freshmen to take a semester or year
of a program which doesn't give
you the necessary requirements for
a decided major.

High school seniors interested in
Pitt should have ben given the
necessary information and follow
up on this possible alternative
study. After the program I

Studio Theatre Opens  

‘The Shadow Box’

By PATTY TASCARELLA
Pitt New 5 Entertainment Editor

“The Shadow Box," Michael Cristopher's Pulitzer Prize winning
play about death. will make its Pittsburgh debut tonight in what is
considered a coup by Pitt’s Studio Theatre.

Both the Pittsburgh Laboratory Theater and the Pittsburgh Public
Theatre wanted the rights to perform the play here, according to
“Shadowbox” director William J. McLaughlin and Kate Scufﬂe, who
is in charge of publicity and is playing one of the major roles in the
production. The Studio Theatre, composed mostly of Pitt
undergraduates, was surprised but delighted to receive permission to
perform “Shadow Box.”

“It’s a showcase for actors—every past is just excellent,” said
Scufﬂe. “This is very, very gripping-——a classical dramatic kind of
thing.”

“Shadow Box” consists of three separate vignettes, connected only
through theme. It takes place in three cottages on the grounds of a
large hospital. Each segment centers on people coping with death
through a special conditioning program.

The cast includes a middle-class couple, Joe (William Castle) and
Maggie (Scufﬂe). a writer and his wife (James Edmondson and Debra
Gordon), and an elderly woman and her companion (Gayle
Gearhart-Herring and Margaret Durkin).

“It’s a play about death,” said McLaughlin, “but it’s very uplifting.
It’s a study of acceptance. Ultimately, it’s a positive experience. It
really relies on the grim subject of death, but on the other hand, it’s
very healthy in the way in which it is dealt with.”

Scuffle said that the cast is entirely composed of Pitt undergraduate
students———a relatively rare happening because the cast usually
includes graduate students or actors with professional experience.

“The Studio Theatre is such ‘an open organization there’s been a lot
of people outside the university cast in other productions,” Scufﬂe
said. “It was so nice the director only chose Pitt students for ‘Shadow
Box.’ ”

Studio Theatre is living up to its traditions by opting for an
undergraduate cast, but the faces on stage are far from unknown to
those familiar with the company. Most are regular participants in the
Studio Theatre’s Lunchtime Series. Scuffle played a role in last fall's
production of “The Farm” and Gordon was in the cast of the
September revival of “Kennedy’s Children.”

To complement the script which “runs something like a James Joyce
piece,” a set was constructed to serve as the interior of a cottage.

Each section takes place in a separate home. McLaughlin said this
illusion will be created by focusing on different sections of the split
level structure and by skillful lighting. Bare branches surround the

Pitt News Staffwritcr
Sherlock Holmes
Directed by D.E. Jukes
Allegheny Community Theater

Sherlock Holmes is perhaps the
only detective whose exploits can
be brought effectively to the
confines of a stage, perhaps due to
the lack of physical ploys such as
high speed auto chases or knock
down, drag out fist fights.
Allegheny Community College’s
Ridge Avenue Theater production
of the play “Sherlock Holmes” is
both effective and entertaining.

The script of “Sherlock Holmes”
is a collaboration between Sir
Arthur Conan Doyle and William
Gillete, who originated the stage
role in 1899.

The plot is typically complex.
James Larrabe (Jim Zunic) and his
wife Madge (Carinne Carpentieri)
are holding Alice Faulkner (Susan
Barujel) hostage in order to get
letters and photographs with which

A they hope to blackmail a high-rank-
ing English Lord.

Sherlock Holmes (Donald De-
Temple) becomes involved fol-
lowed soon after by Holmes’ arch

enemy, Professor Moriarity (Har-‘

old Madison). The letters then
become secondary, and the re-
mainder of the play details
Holmes’ life or death battle with
Moriarity.

The play opens with the
Larrabees attempting to force Alice
to reveal the location of the letters.
Suddenly the butler announces
that Mr. Sherlock Holmes is at the

Evangelista photos.

door. Holmes is outside the house,
but stands on stage, looking into
the drawing room. This beautiful
bit of staging clearly emphasizes

Holmes’ almost omniscient pow- _

ers.

DeTemple is perfect, cool and
detached, easily establishing his
dominance of Zunic’s ineffectual,
nervous Larrabee. Even the more
competent and devious Madge is
no match for Holmes as he
demolishes their pretense.

Soon after, Moriarity is brought
into the plot. Holmes has been
frustrating his plans and Moriarity
sees an opportunity to involve
Holmes in direct battle.

“We are like two big fish,

Three Hearts
Bob Welch
Capitol

Even since his departure from
Fleetwood Mac almost five years
ago, Bob Welch has consistently
opted for electric, synthesized
variations of the Seconal California
pop sound. Welch ultimately found
success with his “French Kiss"
album after an unsuccessful stint
with the now-extinct Paris.

“Three Hearts," Welch’s latest
release, follows on the heels of his
recent success and maintains at

least
“French Kiss.”

Welch relies on catchy rhythms as
his hook of appeal. This works fine
on some cuts but falls far short on
others.

some consistency from

Though the material on “Three
lacks any personality.

“Three Hearts" opens with the

title track, probably one of the

album's standout cuts. It's one of
those catchy tunes that was the
trademark of “French Kiss.”
Following is the album’s best
offering, “Oh Jenny.” The cut
sounds like the material produced
by Welch during his days with
Fleetwood Mac—Christine McVie

it

lends harmony and back-up vocals.
Welch presents a nice interpreta-

tion of Lennon and McCartney’s “I

Saw Her Standing There.”

Next are a couple of lackluster
tunes that even catchy rhythms and
string accompaniment fail to
salvage. “Here Comes the Night”
and “China” are mildly distracting
and just plain dull after three good
cuts.

Closing side one is the cut “The
Ghost of Flight 401.” It’s
particularly interesting in that

us must go.” A

Although Moriarity’s subordi-
nates are incompetent and bum-
bling, mere charades of the
gentlemen they portray, Madison
immediately establishes his Mori-
arity as a criminal genius to be
feared and respected.

.-DeTemple and Madison give
standout performances. Their
verbal duels are excellent and
when these two masterminds meet,

the audience can feel the tension
build.

Director D.E. Jukes also turns in
a fine performance as Dr. Watson.
In one particularly good scene,
Holmes speaks with Watson_ahu_i
his addiction to cocaine, tracing it
to boredom. Jukes clearly conveys
Watson's concern and confusion

Sherlock Holmes
Comes Back to Stage ,

over what he sees as a destructive
and wasteful pastime.

Also turning in strong per-
formances are Zunic, as the
bumbling Larrabee, Gean Miller as
Bassick, Moriarity’s right hand
man, and Patrick Finnegans short
but memorable role as Leary. a
crazed hired murderer.

The play is fast moving and
involving, because of the intriguing
plot and the fact that interruptions
are kept to a minimum.

The sets for the first,three scenes
are all on the stage through act
one. Jukes uses the lights well to
limit each set and switch the
audience’s attention from one set
to another. The lighting crew is to
be congratulated for a fine job.

Although the performance was
not without a few minor rough
edges, “Sherlock Holmes” is both
excellent entertainment and engag-
ing, effective theater.

Side two begins with another of
the album’s better offerings—the
brisk, up-tempo rocker, “Precious

g The Changing Seasons: Writ in Water

By MARTHA H. GARVEY

This was supposed to be an essay
on the joys of spring, but Pittsburgh
doesn't have any. Joy‘of spring, that
is. In the period known as spring, the
city is covered with a warm and gluey
haze. The crocuses come up; three
days later, they die of frost.

What has always distinguished the
seasons—or at least. winter from

 

 

HIIHLIIIIlilllliiiilliIHii‘1Ii‘iiiiiiuiiiinuh

warmth-is water. Ice melts and the
river moves. The lakes become as
blue as gas flames. When warm
weather comes, oceans are no less
large, only more welcoming. Swim-
ming pools are filled, inevitably with
the winter's leaves still stuck to the
bottom.

Every spring is different, but water
is always there, waiting for warmth.
Each summer brings a new kind of
heat, and the water waits to relieve it.
Bodies of water change, but they

. never move. They may alter
shape—Iike people we love-—but they
never leave. The difference between
winter and spring to me is that the
bodies of water I love will receive me
as they have done all my life.

I first met a body of water when I
was three months old. I was a baby
with two major voices. One was rip-
ping off the cover of Time magazine.

The other my family discovered when
we went to Cape Cod . I was outfit-

ted in the traditional cute baby gear: .

sandy diaper, grubby T~shirt, im-
maculate sun hat. I was deposited
on the sand, expected to watch the
ocean as though it were a television. I
headed straight for the water, and

almost reached it. My parents pulled A

me away, replacing me on dry land. I
lurched toward the water again.

My mother took me into the water,
danced with me on top of the waves
so only the bottoms of my'feet got
wet. Thinking she'd satiated my need
for water, she dumped me back on
the sand. By this time, my sun hat
had fallen off, and my clothes had
declined from adorably grubby to ab-
solutely filthy. I didn't cry. I just tried
to crawl faster, so my mother
wouldn't catch me so quickly.

The Atlantic Ocean sighed and spit V

at me. It creeped to me, then jumped
back—-as though it were afraid of me.
It moved like me, in shuffles and
sprawls and belly rolls. It smelled

wonderful-—unlike the German‘

shepherd who was as taken with me
as I was with the ocean.

My parents were he Ilpless If they
took me to the farthest comer of the
beach, I just moved more slowly
toward the water to save my
strength. No matter how often they
took me into the water, swishing me
over the waves like a feather, it
wasn't enough. I was an infant rock
my mother and father pushed to the
top of the beach--only to watch me
roll down again. I never Ieamed. On
the last day of our vacation, I was still
trying to ‘make friends with the
biggest baby I'd ever seen in my life.

 
   

I was more afraid of my first
swimming teacher than I was of the
swimming pool. Outside of the
ocean, Mr. Goldman was the most
awesome creature I'd ever seen in
my life. His trunks ended where his
stomach began. He had a wonderful,
huge stomach, always in motion, with
black hair sprouting from it like grass.
I suppose, with the logic of a four-
year-old, that the hair had to go
somewhere if it couldn't live on
his head.

When Mr. Goldman jumped into
the Y's pool, half the slick green
water jumped out (along with a
couple of children). When I began
learning how to swim, I had no
concept of drowning. But I hadva
very clear idea of what would
happen if Mr. Goldman landed on
me.

The pool was in the basement of
the Y, filled with both serious swim-

Mr. Goldman knew better. His hair on

mers—mostly old men in nose plugs
and bathing caps—and novices, who
regularly bumped into the serious
swimmers. There was a chair at the
deep end for Howie, who watched
over the whole moi when he wasn't
teaching the advanced class. Howie
had the traditional lifeguard equip-
ment: tight blue trunks, over-
developed pectoral muscles, and the
adoration of every girl over age three.

If we survived Mr. Goldman, we
would pass to intermediate, our class
was told. And somewhere, far in the
future, by the 10 feet deep line, lay
the promise of Howie.

The walls were covered with
cracked tile that had once been
yellow. The air was heavy with
chlorine and small children's sweat.
Some mothers stayed to watch their
children, clapping when they saw a
child improve. Mr.‘ Goldman only
glared and let the child bob in his
hairy arms a little. The mothers lear-
ned not to clap.

Occasionally, I doubled over and
choked. I was still trying to breathe
water instead of air. Mr. Goldman
would blow his whistle, slosh over,
snatch me up like a basketball. He
yelled every time: “Whaddya think
you are, a whale? Stop trying to drink
my pool."

One day, I was just standing in the
shallow end when Mr. Goldman came
over to me and picked me up gently.
“You've got to leave,” he said. ‘‘I
don't want you anymore."

I was terrified into silence. He
held me and took me farther out, past
five feet. I thought I was going to be
an example to all the kids who hung
onto the ladder and cried. He was
going to sit on me for all the world to
see. I thought I'd been doing well.

his stomach felt like fur, soft and
thick. I was comforted by that.

“Don't kick my stomach, kld," Mr.
Goldman mumbled. The water was
up to his neck. My heart was beating
in my head.

“Here, Howie. She's good. Take
her," and Mr. Goldman passed me in-
to the advanced class.

Q Q Q

I'm a clumsy person. Flatherthan
develop a backhand, I switch my ten-
nis racket to the other arm. I can't
downshift a car and drive it at the
same time. I spent my fourteenth bir-
thday in Children's Hospital because I
sat too hard on my ankle and sprained
it. And, if I'm in a play, I have to write
my blocking on my hand or I won't
remember it.

Water is the only place I know
where this doesn't matter. Water is

both a prenatal state and a sexual
one. In water, I am part of a large
whole, surrounded and engulfed. No
body had the power to engulf the way
water does.

Once, Lake Erie pulled me under
and would not let me go. Above me,
it was raining, and I could see the rain
hit the surface of the lake and
become a part of it. I kept watching,
although I was almost unconscious.
My life was suddenly simple. I was

-going to live, if Lake Erie would

release me. I was going to die, if it
wouldn't. I would breathe air, or I
would breathe water. lfloated to the
surface, felt the rain hitting me,
fragments about to become whole.
The rain remained on top of my skin,
resistant, separate, not a part of me
or the lake. I swam back to the
beach, to the world of air.

Water is the only place where I am
alone, mute, deaf, blind, if I want to
be so. Sleep brings silence but it
does not bring solitude. A dreaming
person is never alone, only unable to
touch the people she sees.

Q i f i‘ O

In the summer, I live by a lake in
the Berkshire Mountains. The lake is
called Queechy, which, I am told,
means “cute but too short to work.”
When I was ten years old and very
fat, I used to sit on the dock in the rain
and look into the water, trying to
count the pockmarks the raindrops
made.

I would make a list of all the things
ever done wrong to me, and imagine
how things would be different if the
boy who lived by the dock fell madly
in love with me. But Steve was too
busy working on his motorboat.
Besides, he thought I was counting
the rings in the lake. He didn't know I
was pining.

  

I3? FNKS

I'd leave the lake only when I was
thoroughly and (I thought) roman-
tically soaked, taking care to pause
dramatically by his cottage. He was
usually playing the Rolling Stones so
loud that the emphatic pad of my
pudgy feet was drowned out. So he
never fell in love with me.

Steve works for a radio station in
California now, but I still sit on the
dock. I'm not waiting for anything
now. It strikes me that however hard
I pined for Steve, sitting by the lake
never made me unhappy, only wet. I
sit by the water, as I did when I was a
baby, but no hands snatch me away.
And perhaps it's better that Steve
never realized my grand passion.
What if he'd known? What if he'd said
something? I would have had to ad-
mit then whatl know now. I love the
water, only. The blue-eyed boy was
just a backdrop, an excuse to be c" "
of the lake.

In the Market for Two Downtown Restaurants?

By STEPHEN KROLL

Arthur's lies on the thin line
dividing the good restaurants from
the truly fine ones. Atmosphere is
abundant here, with many small
wooden tables scattered throughout
the room. On each were calico
placemats, an oil lamp or candle and a
small spray of dried flowers. One
brick ’wall housed two blazing
fireplaces, while the others were
papered, serving as background for
nondescript prints. The room is very
much like a country inn. Intimate but
not repressive.

All the basics for good dining are
present at Arthur's. Moments after

ordering, our waiter returned with the ,

cocktails. Dubonnet on-the-rocks
($1 .50) was accompanied by an airy
cheese puff of roquefort and herbs.

This flaky tidbit was a delightful mate
for the aperitif. After giving us time
to talk and eat thehorsd’oeuvres, our
waiter returned to recite the menu.

The numerous entrees were
described in full, easily confusing us
as we struggled to remember each
one. Some available entrees were
Beef Wellington, red snapper, a
seafood platter and a choice of floun-
der or veal. Not a single type of
poultry was offered. Prix fixe at $14.
Dinner includes soup, salad, entree,
dessert and coffee or tea.

At this point the mistakes started
surfacing. Each dish was perfect in
its own right, but when gathered
together, the elements did not make
a workable ensemble. The soup, a
creamy onion, was delicious and
hearty, but unnecessarily heavy ad-
dition to the meal. A clear broth or
consomme would have been better.

The salad proved to be the most
disappointing part of the meal.
Leaves of garden fresh leaf lettuce
nested some slices of mushrooms
whose bottoms had not been
removed and a few olives.A simple,
rather than the cream style vinaigret-
te would have been better as the
dressing. Most disturbing was the
reappearance of roquefort cheese. It
was fine in the cheese puff, but its
strong flavor made the glass of house
chablis ($1.75) taste unpleasantly
sour

The wine regained its former
character, however, when consumed

A with the flounder. Flaky filets of wine

poached fish concealed artichoke
bottoms, which in turn rested on a
bed of white asparagus spears. Ser-
ved in a heated casserole, the dish
was a delightful mingling of subtle
flavors. Veal a la Libertoire, the dinner
special, was the opposite of the fish.
Tucked inside a veal medallion were

smoked scallops and cheese, served

upon a nest of fettuccini and with a
Marsala wine sauce. The chef's grand
specialty was ruined by inexcusably
tough veal. The vegetables were
more a delight for the eye than the
palate: mushy, bland carrots and a
single floweret of cauliflower made
less than a favorable impression.

A slice of heavenly amaretto
cream pie made up sufficiently for a
pitiful selection of desserts. Housed
in a sweet pastry crust and topped
with a wisp of unsweetened whipped
cream, this rich confection was a fan-
tasy come true for dessert lovers.

The pie was included in the price of
the meal. and the fewalternatives had

to be ordered at additional cost. A

around the room showed that this
'estaurant is a storehouse of con-
trasts. The dining room is small,
crowded and extremely- noisy. At
every conversational lull, l was jarred
by the decibel level.

A yellow and white motif
dominates the room, and framed
theatrical posters adorn the walls.
Each table possessed a bud vase
with a few yellow and white flowers, a
single candle and neatly pleated linen
napkins. Intimacy, however, was not
conveyed by the surroundings, and
the room would assault the eyes if
brightly lit.

I perused the menu while sipping
Dubonnet on-the-rocks ($2 ), and
was delighted to find some items I
have never seen before on a Pit-
tsburgh menu. After a few tough
choices were made, the order was

snifter of Drambuie ($2 ) .and a
hearty cup of coffee were a luxurious
completion to an almost perfect meal.

The check for one was a rather
steep $23.29, including tax andtip.
Without alcohol, the complete price
would have come closer to $17.
Dinner was bad enough to regret
dining at Arthur's. But the restaurant
is so romantically intimate that one
might overlook its shortcomings.
Reservations are a must, and one can
pass with casual (non-denim) sport
clothes. Any bus caught on Fifth
Avenue going into town will take
one within a few blocks of Arthur's,
which is right off Market Square.

La Muse Continentale is a curious
olace. We arrived exactly at 7:30,
and were seated at a small table
against the right wall. A quick glance

placed and an evening of delightful
surprises ensued. Simple touches,
such as a lemon slice in the water
glass, added to the meal.

Beef in lemon aspic ($2 l,
mysterious and smoky, arrived on a
plate of spinach. On a layer of
mushroom slices, tender pieces of
cooked beef were formed into a
cake, and then covered with the tart
gelatin. Oysters Rockefeller, shrimp
and seasonal melon were also of-
fered. lced cherry soup ($2 ) was
distinctly memorable. Tart cherries,
floating in a spiced broth reminiscent

of Christmas-time wassail, were
finished with a dollop of sour cream
and a shot of vodka. The soup was
only slightly sweet, and very
pleasing. Creamy french onion
($1 .50) was also available. The
house salad of spinach, bibb lettuce,
watercress and capers ($1 .50), was
magnificent in its simplicity, but
should not have been priced as an a
la carte item. A Caesar’s salad for two
could also have been prepared at
table side. 1

The array of entrees, which in-

cluded tournedo and veal selections
of the evening, were priced accor-
ding to their complexity and com-
postion. The chef's specialty of veal
Scotia was $9 and sauteed
seafood was between $1 1-$14.00.

We chose Ch icken Pontalba ($9.00)
and Rosettes of Lamb Printanier
($16.00). A deboned breast of ten-
der chicken rested on a bed of peas
and fried potatoes,andwas covered
by a velvety sauce. The rosettes
were gorgeous and worth the expen-
se for one who loves lamb. Each
rosette, (which is to the rack of lamb
what the filet is to the prime rib of
beef), was wrapped in a slice of
bacon, then cooked to a perfect

shade of pink. Accompanied by crisp
slices of turnip, mushroom caps and
asparagus spears, the dish was com-
pleted by a subtle sauce of brandy
and Chartreuse. Vegetables in-
cluded a trio of cauliflower, broccoli
and carrot slices, blanched until just
tender, and risetto, a rice dish with
tiny chunks of carrot and celery.
Asparagus could be ordered for an
additional $2. A glass of the house
rose ($1.50) was a perfect com-
aanion for both entrees.

Desserts were enumerated over a
bottomless cup of excellent coffee
(.75), and indecision reigned again.
Cheesecake, either ' plain or
chocolate, chocolate mousse, ice
cream and complimenting liqueur
strawberries in champagne and our

choice of bananas flambe ($6 for
two) were available. The bananas,

sauteed with pecans, triple sec and

creme de banana, then flamed in
brandy, were served over vanilla ice
cream in balloon wine glasses; a rich
mixture of tastes.

The check came wrapped in a
napkin, as well it should have At
$32 for one including tax and tip,’
it was undeniably expensive. with a
little less indulgence, a meal con-
sisting of the chicken, house salad,
house rose, a less expensive dessert

all inclusive. Similarly priced meals
with other entrees could have easily
been composed.

Reservations should be made 2 to
3 weeks in advance. Anything less
than formal dress would prove un-
comfortable. Be sure to allot plenty
of time for dinner as it took slightly
over 2 hours from beginning to end.

By MARY JANE MCKEEVER

Pitt's .Student Union, until 1956
the luxurious Hotel Schenley, soon
may undergo a third transformation, if

the University’s plans to renovate it
come through.

The classical 10-story building,
constructed in 1898, was the city’s
first large steel-framed “skyscraper”
hotel.

Franklyn F. Nicola, tin en-

trepreneur whose dream was to‘

make Oakland the cultural/civic cen-
ter of Pittsburgh, decided the
establishment of a great hotel was a
Driority.

In late 1897, Nicola and his
brother, A_. G. Nicola formed the
Bellefield Corporation, along with 56
of P,i_tt's_burgh"s most prominent men
(including George Westinghouse, H.
J. Heinz and Andrew Carnegie). The

‘corporation bought a 3‘/2-acre cor-

nfield bounded by Bigelow Boulevard
and Fifth and Forbes Avenues as the

_ hotel site.

When the Hotel Schenley opened
Oct. 1 , 1898, the only other building
of consequence in the area was the
unfinished Carnegie Institute. A farm
and pasture occupied the land on
which the Cathedral of Learning now
stands. Forbes Field, the home field
of the Pirates for over 60 years, was
a decade away from construction.

The hotel took its name from near-
by Schenley Park. The park and the
land on which the hotel was construc-
ted had been owned by Mary
Croghan Schenley, who gave and
sold a good deal of land to Pittsburgh.

Mary Croghan Schenley was the
granddaughter of James O'Hara, a
native of Liverpool, England, who set-
tled in Pittsburgh after the
Revolutionary War. O’Hara
proceeded to purchase large tracts
of land in and’ around Pittsburgh,
eventually totaling. 500 acres. A
banker, he also built the first glass
works west of the Allegheny moun-
tains and became a wealthy man.

One of O’Hara’s three children,
Mary, married William Croghan, an at-
torney. Mary Elizabeth Croghan,

their only child to survive infancy, was

..r-._.. ...F. -

(Hotel Schenley: Past Glamor, F

born? in 1826. Two years later her
mother died, and a vast estate
passed to her young daughter.

Croghan sent young Mary to what
was considered an excellent finishing
school on Staten Island in New York.
While she was there, boarding
school's headmistress, a Mrs.
McLeod, was visited by her brother-
in-law, Captain Edward Schenley, a
twice-widowed English veteran of the
Battle of Waterloo. He and Mary
Elizabeth Croghan fell in love and
eloped to England. She was 15; he
was 43. As Captain Schenley put it
in a letter to a friend:  . .I think (these
letters) will convince you that
disparity of age is the only
thing...seriously to be advanced as
an objection...” Schenley had a gift
for understatement.

Because of the elopement and the
ensuing scandal, the Statenlsland
boarding school was closed. An
enraged William Croghan, not trusting
his new son-in-law's intentions, was
able to get the Pennsylvania
Legislature to pass a law putting
Mary’s trust money under his own
care.

When Croghan died in 1850, he
left the fortune to Mary. The
Schenleys, who were married for 36
years and had nine children, made
England their home, visiting Pit-
tsburgh only intermittently.

Mary Schenley was generous to
Pittsburgh, however. In 1880, she
gave 300. acres to Pittsburgh for
Schenley Park and five acres to the
Western Pennsylvania Institute for
the Blind. She gave a blockhouse to
the Pittsburgh chapter of the
Daughters of the American
Revolution in 1895. In 1891, she
sold 100 acres of property to the city
for development in Oakland. When
she died in 1903, her estate was
worth $50 million.

The Hotel Schenley hosted many
distinguished guests. The 1908
guest book shows that in April, Har-
vey Firestone, founder of the
Firestone and Rubber Co. stayed at
the hotel.

In the same month, Enrico Caruso,
the famous ltalian tenor, checked into

a five-room suite with two valets. In
May 1908, Woodrow Wilson, then
president of Princeton University,
visited the city. He came again as
president of the United States in
1916.

With the opening of Forbes Field in
1909, most visiting major league
baseball teams housed their players
at the hotel. Babe Ruth, Casey
Stengel and Ty Cobb all stayed there.

At the same time, Nicola per-
suaded the Oakland Chamber of
Commerce to invite the University of
Pittsburgh to move to Oakland from
its home on the North Side. When it
did so, it enhanced Oakland’s
reputation as the cultural center of
the city.

Iowa-born Lillian Russell, the ac-
claimed actress and beauty, married
Pittsburgh newspaper publisher (and
later American ambassador to Spain)
Alexander Pollock Moore in the hotel
in 1912. The wedding took place in
the famous pink French Suite (now
Dining Rm. A, B, C) decorated in the
Louis XV style, and was a $50 a plate
affair where an imported gold service
was u s e d .

Russell once lived on the fourth
floor of the hotel in suite 405-7.

Many discussions leading to the
formation of the United States'S.teel
Corporation were held at the hotel.
On the evening of Jan. 9, 1901, 89
officials of the Carnegie Steel Co., in-
cluding Charles Schwals, Lawrence
Phipps and William Singer, cele-
brated the formation of U.S. Steel,
the nation’s first billion-dollar cor-
poration, at a banquet held in the
SchenIey’s ballroom.

Sarah Bernhardt stayed at the
Schenley while appearing at the old
Duquesne Theater. Nelson Eddy,
Jeannette MacDonald and Henry
Fonda were other actors to stay at
the hotel.

Eleanora Duse, the famed ltalian
tragedlan, died in 1924 while a guest
at the Schenley in suite 524-6. She
caught pneumonia while searching
alone in the rain for the stage door at
the Syria Mosque across the street.

Ironically, Duse was appearing at the -.

‘ and improved.

uture Promise ,

Syria Mosque in a play entitled “The
Closed Door.” A plaque was placed
in the hotel to honor her.

In addition to Wilson, other
presidents who stayed at the hotel
included ,Theodore Roosevelt, who
visited during his 1912 presidential
campaign, and William Howard Taft,
who prepared an address to a Cham-
ber of Commerce supper at the
Soldiers and Sailors Memorial at the
hotel. \

The hotel was only slightly
modified when it became the Student
Union. Today, it is in real need of
renovation. According to Terry
Milani, associate director of student
activities, the University is “definitely
committed to renovation."
Renovation would begin six months
after funding was approved and
would progress over about the next
18 months, Milani said.

The extent of the renovation will
depend upon the funding. Two plans
have been proposed, a $6.5 million
plan and a $13.5 million plan, Milani

(said. No matter which plan is adop-

ted, each Pitt student will pay a
student union fee to cover the cost of
the renovation, he added.

The renovated union would have
organizational, governmental and
media floors, Milani said. The
recreation room would be remodeled
Seating would ac-
commodate 300 people. There
would be 10 game tables and Ping-
Pong tables. ylandball courts, exer-
cise rooms and a sauna are also
possibilities. If the $13.5 million plan
is adopted, according to Milani, an
auditorium with seating for 1,000
would be constructed in the rear of
the building.

The ex-Hotel Schenley may have a
grand future yet.

Imagine a play whose two main
characters don't know each other
and never come into contact in any
way. .

This is only one of the strange
aspects of “Inching Through the
Everglades,” a play written and
performed by the Provisional
Theatre. The 99 cent Floating
Theatre Festival brought this Los
Angeles-based touring troupe to

‘the Lion’s Walk for one perfor-
, 4 mance Sunday evening.

Michael Dawdy plays Willie Rae,

 

a wanderer who works construction
jobs. Candace Laughlin is Irene,

an unmarried supermarket check-V

out clerk. They alternate with each
other, taking the stage for short
scenes that give snatches of their
lives.

The one thing that links the two
is their common position at the
base of the socio-economic scheme.
They are incredibly ordinary
people.

Willie is a simple, down-home
boy, the closest thing possible to a
universal American. He has an
open, direct, yet friendly nature

and a taste for adventure.
Fortunately,’ Willie’s identity ex-
tends beyond the‘ stereotype.
Though it's obvious he has no great
mental capacity, Willie thinks a
lot. In his own uncomplicated
fashion, he tries to keep fully aware
of himself and everything around
him.

His vulnerability, also, makes
him very human. He admits his
self doubts and expresses dis-
appointment in the way his life

seems to slip by uneventfully.

Dawdy must be credited on this
point, especially since vulnerability

Barry White will be at the Stanley April 1 7.

is no easy thing for a male actor to
project.

As Irene, Laughlin provides most
of the play’s humor. This weakens
her character somewhat. She
doesn't show the same optimism
and determination that Willie does.
Irene is more a victim, partly
because of the comic effect, but
also because she has a harder
struggle as a woman.

“Inching” takes a lighter ap-
proach than past Provisional

in a subtler. more artful fashion.
Still, they sometimes tread too

close to the hard propaganda line.
The Indian issue, which is outside
the main focus of the play, is
brought on so heavily and
persistently that the audience is
beaten over the head with it.
However justifiable that may be, It
works against the intended effect.
At other times, they fall into an
oversimpliﬁed, naive outlook, such
as the song at the end with its

Divers Greenwell, Winkler Qualify for NCAA Championships

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer

Panthers Pat Greenwell and
Scott Winkler have qualiﬁed for the
National Collegiate Athletic Associ-
ation diving championship to be
held March 22 to 24 at the
Cleveland State Natatorium.

Greenwell, both one and three-
meter diving, and Winkler, three-
meter diving, qualiﬁed by placing
in the top four in their events in the
last weekend’s pre-qualifying meet
at Harvard.

The most valuable diver in Pitt's

recent capture of the Eastern
swimming and diving champion-
ship, Greenwell ﬁnished second
and third on the one and
three-meter diving boards, while
Winkler was third in the three-
meter competiton.

Greenwell led going into the
three-meter diving ﬁnals, but a bad
dive pushed him back to second
place and allowed Cornell All-
America Paul Steck to win the
event, sweeping victories on both
the one and three-meter boards.

According to Panther diving

coach Al Coffey, it was one of Pitt's
most impressive showings ever in
an NCAA pre-qualiﬁer and the ﬁrst
time that two Panther divers
advanced to a single NCAA
championship.

Winkler said that the pre-quali-
ﬁer “is a very competitive meet,”
adding that “only a few divers are
chosen to compete.”

“You have to score at least 290
points on the low boards and 310 on
the high boards twice during the
dual meet season to qualify,”

explained Winkler, a veteran of
NCAA championship competition.
‘ ‘It is certainly an honor for Pat and
me to do as well as we did.”

championship of any kind,” Green-

‘;well said. “l’ve tried qualifying
jﬁve times, but never have made
it-’’

The meet was also gratifying for 

Greenwell, currently enjoying his :_i

best season at Pitt. In last season's
pre-qualiﬁer, the sophomore from
Florida missed making the NCAAs
by ﬁnishing sixth in the three-
meter diving.

Greenwell said he is “hungry”
for the upcoming NCAAS.
“This will be my ﬁrst national

swimmers Mark Sch uman,

“Now that I’ve made it, I’d like

‘-to do well,” Greenwell continued.
';“I ‘think it would be a pleasing
__ feeling to say that I’ve done well in
‘the NCAA championship.”

Where ‘Battle of the Network Stars’ Left 

Remember Kyle Rote, J r.?

Years and countless “Superstar” competitions
ago, professional soccer star Rote and a handful of
pro athletes from a wide variety of sports competed
in one of ABC’s first attempts to make big money by
televising a “new” athletic event. Somewhat akin to
a cross between an Olympics and a Dean Martin
celebrity roast, the Superstars competition boomed.

Soon, America was watching Lynn Swann set
records in that favorite of Superstar events, the ob-
stacle course; Lou Ferrigno (pre-Hulk era) lift
weights; and the Pittsburgh Steelers battle the Min-
nesota Vikings in an agonizing tug-of-war.

But, it would not stop there.

Naturally, network actors and even rock groups
got into the act: Who will ever forget the golfing
heroics of Farrah Fawcett-Majors, the intensity of
Robert Conrad as he nearly broke bones on the ob-
stacle course and Rod Stewart bouncing a soccer ball
off his face?

So, it’s about time the superstar-format included
college athletes. The original idea of ABC Superstars
competition was interesting. It made for some dif-
ferent and even exciting competitions, before Gabe
Kaplan, Howard Cosell and the network turned it in-
to a three-ring circus.

Now, Myriad Productions, an independent
production company in Oklahoma City, is working
on a college superstar format competition. Its main
goal is not capturing the attention of “Three’s Com-
pany” audiences, but of viewers eager to watch
genuine athletes compete in a number of events, just
as ABC originally intended.

Of course, there’s money to be made here. Myriad
is currently negotiating for a broadcast package and

On the Run

By MAR/A SCIULLO

 

According to Bob Stevens, part of Myriad’s
National College All-Stars production committee,
ll0 universities and the military academies have been
contacted in a search of athletes. Schools were asked
to select eight graduating seniors who will be allowed
to keep whatever they win.

 

“Of course,” said Stevens, “if an athlete so
desires, he may turn down his winnings in order to
maintain amateur status. We have quite a few
Olympic hopefuls entered and so they have the op-
tion of refusing a cash prize.”

The Pitt athletic department administrators have
selected football players Gordon Jones and Mike
Balzer; .basketball’s Terry Knight and Wayne
Williams; wrestler Jim Gordon; swimmer Mark
Schuman, and track’s Mike Sapienza as its represen-
tatives. Football player Steve Gaustad and runner
Keith Leckenby were named alternates.

Although plans have not yet been finalized, it ap-
pears the individual competition will take place over
four separate one-week periods in which two Pitt
athletes will participate in each session.

A total of $380,500 in prize money has been men-
tioned, to be split among those earning points in any
of the nine events offered. Two contests are man-
datory, the obstacle course and an electronic “mental
aptitude” test.

“Our mental quiz game should be interesting for
the audience and fun for the kids,” said Stevens.
“It’s a really different idea.”

Athletes will then choose to compete in four to six
of the remaining events: 100-yard dash, golf, 880-
yard run, one-mile bicycle race, 50-meter swim,
weightlifting and gymnastics. Competitors are
restricted from entering their own specialties. For
example, Schuman would not be allowed to swim.

According to Stevens, however, an intercollegiate
team competition is also in the works. “lt’s every
team for itself. Athletes will be able to compete in
their specialties in this case, Stevens said.

Bob Seagren would have liked that.

Gymnasts to Vault into Limelight?

By JEFF DUROSKO
Pitt News Staff Writer
Women's gymnastics coach Don-
na DeMarino Sanft predicts the
Pantherettes will be “ready to
peak” when they travel to
Maryland tomorrow to compete in
the Eastern Association of Intercol-

legiate Athletics for Women
championships.
“Right now,” she said, “we’re

as ready as we ever will be. The
injury situation is better than it has
been for quite some time.”

Competing all-around for Pitt
will be sophomores Bonnie Tressler
and Myra Bachuchin, and fresh-
men Holly Martino and Roxanne
Evans. Alison Hoburg will work
three events while Dawn Reimer,
Diane Debich and Karen Zandi will
also compete.

The Pantherettes are hoping to
qualify as a team for nationals, a
goal which they just missed last
year.

“The only way that I can walk
out of there and be sure that we
qualiﬁed for nationals is if we score
over 138,” said Sanft. “But, if we
score less than 134, l’ll know we"
blew it.” «

Pitt is seeded third in the
competition behind Clarion and
Penn State. Both teams defeated

Pitt during the regular season. -‘

Massachusetts and New Hamp-
shire are seeded fourth and ﬁfth,
respectively. Last season, those
teams defeated Pitt.

“If we can really hit, we can
ﬁnish third,” said Sanft;
shooting for a score of about 136 or
137.”

Tressler and Bachuchin qualiﬁed
as individuals for nationals last
season, and they and the rest of the
Pantherettes are hoping that Pitt
qualiﬁes as a team.

“When you go to nationals as an
individual, it’s an empty feeling,”
said Sanft. “It really means a lot to

nationals.

situation, we’ve really had to pull

together.”

According to Sanft, the indi-
viduals are all submerged in the
team. She said that they don’t
want to be in the spotlight as
individuals, but that they want it as
a team.

“We belong at nationals,” Sanft
said. “We know it and our
competitors know it. A team of our

‘caliber just deserves to be there."

GYM NOTES: Pitt was not

poll....Nationals will be held at

therettes ﬁnished ﬁfth at last

Track Team Fifth at Eastems

By ANGELA VAVITHES
Pitt News Staff Writer

'Pitt’s women’s track team made
the long trip to Princeton, N.J., for
its most important meet of the
indoor season, the Eastern Associ-
ation of Intercollegiate Athletics for
Women (EAIAW) championships,
and returned with a- fifth-place
finish out of 45 teams.

Peri Jude _ Radecic led the
Pantherettes with a 14.05 meter
throw, finishing second in the shot
put. Radecic had the farthest throw
of the day, but it was disallowed

1' because of an off1cal‘s error in

measurement.
Things did not go well in the

880-yard relay either. After out-‘

distancing all competitors in the
semi-finals, the Pantherettes had
two sloppy baton handoffs that
most likely cost them first place.
Instead, they finished third, only

.26 seconds
Maryland.

Sprinter Gwen Murray re-injured
a hamstring muscle in the relay but
still ﬁnished fourth in the 220-yard
dash final. The injury caused Pitt to
scratch the one-mile relay. Both the
one- and two-mile relays had
qualified for the finals. ,

Hurdler Leslie Palmer finished
fourth, also.

Two high jumpers, Karen
Krichko, who finished third, and
Marie Ribik, fifth, both jumped 5-7
and had a great weekend,
according to coach Dan Goodyear.

“They both tied the indoor jump
record and matched their personal
records. They have a good shot at
qualifying for nationals during
outdoor season,” he said.

‘ NIT Hands Out Byes 6
To Ohio State, Indiana

By The Associated Press

' NEW YORK—Indiana and Ohio‘

State drew byes into the college
basketball semi-finals of the
National Invitation Tournament
Tuesday, causing Purdue coach
Lee Rose to say,

“Can someone explain to me the
advantage of being the Big Ten
champion?”

Purdue will play at home against
Old Dominion while Alabama will
meet Texas A&M at Houston in
third-round games Thursday night,

_ with the winners playing in one

semi-ﬁnal and Ohio State and
Indiana playing te other next
Monday night in Madison Square
Garden. The ﬁnal will be held in
the Garden next Wednesday.

Ohio State and Indiana got their

byes in a blind draw Tuesday-

morning following Monday night's
second-round games in which Ohio
State beat Maryland 79-72, Indiana
edged previously unbeaten Alcorn
State 73-69, Purdue ripped Dayton
84-70, Old Dominion edged Clem-
son 61-59 in two overtimes and

 Alabama _1_1ipped Virginia 90-88.

“I'm confused,” said \ Rose.
“First, we win the Big Ten
(actually, the Boilepmakers were
co-champions with Michigan State
and Iowa) and we go to the NIT.”

The 15th-ranked Boilermakers.
the only nationally-ranked team left
in the NIT, missed out on the
NCAA tournament, to which
Michigan State and Iowa were
invited. But Iowa beat them twice

during the regular season while
Michigan State and Purdue split.

“And now the Big Ten’s fourth
and fifth-place teams (Ohio State
and Indiana) get byes and we
don't.”

Ohio State coach Eldon Miller’s
said, “We love it, particularly since
we're in ﬁnal exams through
Thursday.”

Indiana coach Bobby Knight was
unavailable for comment.

’ Panther Mark Nigh.

 

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Staff Writer
Next month, new light will be
shed on the soccer career of former
Nigh has

signed a contract with the

Pennsylvania Stoners, the newest

member of the American Soccer
League (ASL) and will begin his
professional career April 14, when
the Stoners face the New York
Eagles.

Nigh began playing soccer in the

Lehigh Valley when he was 12

years old‘. The move -to soccer

A stemmed from Nigh’s realization

he was not big enough to play the
ever-popular neighborhood game
of football. The switch turned out to
be a successful one; one that has
led to a professional career.

“I began looking at soccer
because I knew I wasn’t big enough
for football,” Nigh said. “I liked
soccer a lot and I ‘stuck with it. I'm
happy I made ' this important
move.”.

*1‘

Nigh didn’t reach a starting
position in his ‘hometown of
Bethlehem until his senior 7. year,
when he was moved to wing back,
his present position.

“After graduating from high
school, I was asked to play for this

team called the Schimano-Junior/A

Team, playing out of the Lehigh
Valley. We were chosen to tour
Hungary,” said Nigh.” .“We
played six games with top teams in
Hungary and we won each game.”

The success in international play
was encouraging. He‘returned to
soccer on another level in the fall;
this time as a member of a Pitt
team going through a transition.
Pitt, under coach Leo Bemis, was
seeking to build an Eastern power
and Nigh was chosen as\a key to
that program. .

The following four seasons
showed Bemis’ decision to recruit
Nigh was a good one. Nigh started
all four seasons and ‘has played

every position on the ﬁeld with the
exception of goalie.

When he played as a fullback in
his ﬁnal two years, there were
times when spectators wondered if
Nigh wasn’t the goalie. His great
versatility and experience made
Nigh invaluable.

The summer after Nigh’s fresh-
man year, he began thinking about
a professional career. That sum-

/mer, a group of Lehigh Valley

businessmen created a professional
franchise in their area. The team
"was coached by Willie Ehrlich.
“Mr Ehrlich and many others
wanted this team to consist of ‘local

talent,” said Nigh, “so they got
together a group of college players
(and high school players like Nigh’s
brother Karl) and competed as the
Lehigh Valley All-Stars.

“It was presented to us from
the very begining that we would be
turning pro in 1979, once the
biggest part of the team completed
college. They wanted us to ﬁnish
college and get our degrees before
turning pro.” ‘

In the last two -summers, the
All-Stars have played top-name
competition. This competition has
resulted in a very successful and
optimistic outlook , for the \ team,

Indiana State Still No. One

NEW YORK——Indiana State will

go into the NCAA regional
semi-ﬁnals with the No. 1 college
basketball ranking it earned during
its unbeaten regular season. '
' But ﬁve other teams in the
regional semis have brand new
national rankings which were
earned because of" upsets in the
NCAA tournament.

They are No. 14 Penn, which
eliminated North Carolina; No. 16
Oklahoma, which upset Texas;
No. 17 St. .Iohn’s;No. 18 Rutgers,
which ousted Georgetown; and No.
19 Toledo, which eliminated Iowa.

Indiana State, 30-0, an easy
NCAA winner over Virginia Tech,

ieceived 50 of 54 first-place votes
and 1,072 points Tuesday in the
ﬁnal Associated Press poll for the
1978-79. UCLA was a distant
second in balloting by a national

panel of sports writers _and
sportcasters. I
UCLA, which beat stub born

Pepperdine in NCAA play last
Sunday,‘ got two ﬁrst-place votes
and 997 points——;23 more than
Michigan State, No. 3 this week.

The Spartans, who wereranked
fourth before they routed Lamar in
the tournament, received the other
two first-place votes.

pp  Panthers’ Mark Nigh   to Begin     ricareer 

rt.

now known as the Pennsylvania
Stoners. Last summer, the team
competed against every ASL team
and played a German national
touring team. They ﬁnished the
season with an encouraging record
and named Nigh most valuable‘
league player at the fullback
position. , ’

“Since we have already com-
peted with all the professional
teams in the ASL besides Colum-
bus (a new team starting this
year), the only thing that will
change next month is our title,”,
Nigh said. ‘

“we played together for three
years now and know what can~ be
expected form our team and the
other teams in the ASL. -The part
that is different now is that this
game of soccer is my profession
instead of a job on the side like it
has been for so long.”

Nigh looks back on his lastifou/r
years at Pitt and sees that soccer
was the basis of his every ‘week.

 

“Soccer is a year-round project ‘

for any athlete who takes it
seriously,” said Nigh. “There are
always summer leagues and indoor
leagues besides playing for col-‘
lege.’’ \ ~
