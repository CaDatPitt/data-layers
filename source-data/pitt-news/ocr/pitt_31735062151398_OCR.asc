FRESHMEN MEET
FIRST DEFEAT

The C'harleroi High ,School team
took the Rift Freshmen over. Friday
nighlt forthe ﬁrst -defeat the Yearlings
.have suffered this season. The game
was played at Charleroi before, a
rather large and ‘enthusiastic audi-
ence. Pitt played a fairly‘ good game
but was not able to overcome a‘_four
point lead which the Charleroi lads
held until‘ the end of the fray. . Mer-
vis, the Gold and Blue’s star who
performed such yeoman service at
guard earlier in the season,,. has
proved himself avery efﬁcient work-
man at forward. Playing vinhis new
‘position at.=Charlero-i, he was the star
of the game, c«aging;Vv4 -clever. ﬁeld
goals. Kelly, who is leading the team
in ﬁeld goals, was held scoreless in
that line,_ but made’ good on ,l4 out
of 23 «tries from thefoul line._ Bre-S

their duties. well initholdivng down
the Crharleroi iforwar-ds :to 2 ﬁeld

good exhribiltion and was -the only Pitt
man beside Miervis to score from the
ﬁeld. -S _  W  T E
