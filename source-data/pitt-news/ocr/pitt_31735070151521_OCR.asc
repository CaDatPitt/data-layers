Campus
Women’s

to host ‘sex-

positive’ events   .

Cristina Holtzer
For The Pitt News

Pitt’s Campus Women’s Organization wants
women to have better orgasms, among other
things. i I

Dorian Solot, a speaker on embracing
sexuality and healthy sex, will speak at Pitt
on Oct. 22 as a part of CWO’s “The Female
O” presentation. CWO President Erin Case,
a senior majoring in history and ﬁction writ-
ing, thinks the event will be a huge hit.

“It’s going to be very sex—positive,” Case
said. “It should be a really fun event. I’m
excited.”

For CWO, informing women about their
own bodies and what is normal and healthy
isa primary goal. Last year, the club hosted

a biology professor in September who spoke

about the menstrual cycle.

CWO is not a feminist group, Case said,
but wants to create a safe space where indi-
viduals can feel comfortable talking about
anything.

She added that the group welcomes men,
who provide another perspective on issues.

Although Dana Field got sick more often than
most kids, she became unusually ill when
she was 14. In the span of about two months
that year, she lost 50 pounds. To make things
worse, she felt perpetually fatigued. ,

“All of the symptoms I was having weren’t
making sense,” she said.

Wedrzeslday, Septem ber ZTTS

Field’s doctor, believing Field to be an-
orexic, referred her to behavioral special-
ists. After the behavioral specialists failed
to identify what was making Field sick, she
consulted another doctor, who ﬁnally diag-
nosed her with celiac disease.

The disease was the focus of the second ,

annual Gluten-Free Awareness- Carnival,

which was held Thursday from 11 a.m. to

3 p.m. on the William Pitt Union lawn. For
those who suffer from the genetic disease,
certain grains damage the small intestine. .
Gluten-Free My Campus, an advocacy group
for those who suffer from celiac disease,
organized the carnival, which is the club’s
main event of the year.

More than 1,000 people attended the
carnival, according to the Gluten—Free My
Campus President Dhanu Thiyagarajan.

Thiyagarajan, a junior bioengineering
major on the pre—med track, created the
club in October 2011 during her freshman
year after attending the activities fair and
seeing an absence of gluten—free clubs. The
club organized the event to raise awareness
of celiac disease and to educate the public on
gluten—free food options.

At the event, a total of 40 booths, in-
cluding eight set up by local restaurants,
boasted samples, coupons, invitations to
use certain products, games and information .
about eating a gluten—free diet and about
celiac disease. «

Gina Snyder, the owner of Sunny Bridge
Natural Foods, located in McMurray, Pa., set '
up one of the boothson the lawn to display
menus, gluten—free cupcakes and cookies
from the gluten—free bakery she owns. She
opened the bakery two years ago, after main-
taining a store for 11 years.

“I felt there was a need for it,” Snyder
said. “When someone comes in with celiac
disease, they know everything is OK.”

Both Snyder’s store and herbakery use
only local and organic ingredients.

To replace wheat, she uses rice, tapioca or
potatoes. To give the bakery products their
“stickiness,” she uses xanthan, a carbohy-
drate often found in gum.

Ben Josefoski, a general manager for
Noodles 8: Company, displayed the restau-
rant’s gluten—free options. The restaurant
uses rice noodles and a combination of corn

, and rice to provide alternatives suitable for

individuals with celiac.

Mark Dinga, a UPMC dietician, was also
at the carnival to answer questions about
symptoms and testing.

Restaurant and gluten-free advocacy groups provided information and samples at Thursdays carnivai. Ben Brownlee | Staff Photographer

“If a person has celiac disease and doesn’t
know it, every time they consume gluten,
the body reacts,” he said. “Antibodies are
produced, which are actually damaging to
the small intestine.” 1

Dinga, who has celiac disease himself,
compared a normal intestine to a shag car-
pet. The antibodies make the intestine like

linoleum, causing nutrients to slide through .

instead of being absorbed. A

Dinga said that poor nutrient absorption
is part of celiac disease. For thisretasol V any
gluten—intolerant people might bélre;6gniz-
able through traits not immediately con-
nected to the disease, such as short stature,
low body weight and osteoporosis.

Although Field, a junior at Seton Hill
University, is not a member of Gluten—Free
My Campus, she initially planned to attend
the carnival Thursday. She had to change
her plans when she came down with the ﬂu
Wednesday. She said she wanted to attend
the event to ﬁnd more restaurants in the area

' that offer gluten—free options. .

Freshman Jessica Yaukey, a member of
Gluten—Free My Campus, said she thought
the carnival went well, and she was excited
that she could eat all of the food rather than
limiting herself tola few options. .

Several students who attended the event
were not gluten—free. Adam White, a fresh~

man mechanical engineering major, came .

for the free food and games and was pleased
to ﬁnd that the food tasted good.

Morgan Cooper—Okerchiri, a sophomore
ﬁnance major, who also doesn’t typical eat
gluten—free, said that she, to her surprise,
enjoyed the samples at the carnival.

“I had a preconceived notion that gluten-

free food wasn’t tasty. I wanted to try it out. ,

Why not? It’s free food.”

Thiyagaraj an described the club as an
emotional support group and said she wants
the students and faculty to learn “how hard it
is to lead a gluten—free lifestyle.” The carnival

was a step in accomplishing that.

“It’s not just afad,” she said. “It’s for a
medical reason.” I -

Case also said the organization wants
to make everyone feel welcome this year.

“My largest goal is to work on collabo-
rating with other student organizations,”
Case said. “We are open to collaborating
with anyone who wants to collaborate with

us.
One of those collaborations is coming

up soon, according to sophomore women’s _

studies major Eleanora Kaloyeropoulou,
CWO’s business manager. A
CWO will host a “condom casino” jointly

with Rainbow Alliance and the Interfra- ’
ternity Council on Sunday evening in the

William Pitt Union.

September 20, 20t 8 I The Pitt News | vwvvv.pittnevvs,com

“In place of poker chips we are using
condoms,” Kaloyeropoulou said. “The goal
of the evening is to educate the campus on
safe sex and the proper use of condoms.”

Creating a welcoming environment for
everyone is part of the idea of intersec-
tionality, according to CWO Vice President
Emily MacLean, a senior majoring in psy-

1 chology. Intersectionality refersto the ex-

periences of people who are part of multiple

demographics and therefore might have "

a different perspective on gender issues. _
With the help of allies from other com-
munities, CWO will participate in the annual

' Take Back the Night march and rally against

domestic violence Oct. 8. For MacLean,
Take Back the Night is about making women
feel safe on the streets at night. ' T

“We go out into the streets of Oakland
and march and chant and make a ruckus,”
MacLean said.

But CWO is not just about heavy discus-
sion and important rallies, Case, Kaloyero-
poulou and MacLean said.

. They agreed that they appreciate enter-

tainment as well. CWO has movie nights, ,

speakers to talk about toxin—free makeup
products and asession of Strip Aerobics to

4 reduce the stress of ﬁnals week.

p For Case, MacLean and Kaloyeropoulou,
issues that affect women have been impor-
tant to them for several years. MacLean has
been interested in women’s rights issues

since high school, and Case said she‘wfr:o'te

a paper on the suffragettes in elementary
school. For Kaloyeropoulou, it has been an

interest for nearly her entire life.

“I came to college with the intention of
joining this club,” she said. “I went to a girls’
school for a really long time and the ideas
of feminism were just ingrained.”

CWO also offers resources such as free
condoms, tampons and pregnancy tests in
their oﬂice on the sixth ﬂoor of the William
Pitt Union. Any.student can take advantage
of these options, not just CWO members.

Campus Women’s Organization holds
general body meetings Tuesday nights at
8:45 p.m. in the William‘Pitt Union.

“I really think it’s a good place to get
info and to meet people with open minds,”
MacLean said. “It’s just a really good social
space to talk about issues that you might not
get to talk about in your classes.” I

Psychological  do not War

U Natalie Russell
Columnist

President Barack Obama’s most
recent televised address to the
nation was reassuring in that it
proposed a peaceﬁil solution to
the conﬂict in Syria, but it es-
poused an assuming, slippery-
slope narrative that hasn’t sat
well with me.

It’s the same narrative I as-
sociate with the right wing. For
example, “allowing gays to marry
will lead to bestiality” and “re-
stricting gun laws will leave the
American people-powerless to the
government” -— these kinds of
extreme, fear-inducing “what ifs”
are not only inaccurate, they’re
unethical.

In his speech, Obama detailed
the spiral into chaos that would
surely come to fruition if the
United States fails to bomb Syria.

“If we fail to act, the Assad re-
gime will see no reason to stop us-
ing chemical weapons. As the ban
against these weapons erodes,
other tyrants will have no reason
to think twice about acquiring
poison gas and using them. Over
time, our troops would again face
the prospect of chemical warfare
on the battleﬁeld, and it could be
easier for terrorist organizations
to obtain these weapons and to
use them to attack civilians.”

This line of thinking can be
classiﬁed as either paranoia or

‘ sophistry, but it’s undoubtedly

convincing. Although the major-
ity of Americans disapprove of
military action against Syria over-
all, a recent poll by Ipsos-Reuters
reveals that rephrasing the ques-
tion has a major impact on survey
respondents. The phrase “to help
stop the killing of civilians” as

support for military action only
garnered 26 percent in favor,
while “in response to the use of
chemical weapons” boosted the
approval rating up to 42 percent.
The primitive ideology behind
the “public hanging” has been
repeated again and again in this
case, with the above quote as a
prime example. There’s talk of
“other tyrants” lurking, waiting
to commit some immoral atroc-
ity the second the United States
shows a hint of mercy. It’s a kind
of regurgitated truism about hu-
man psychology that is too often
taken at face value alone. Is there
really any reason to believe that
these ambiguous tyrants around
the globe would otherwise be
wreaking havoc if it weren’t for
the United States’ strong, ex-

ampled punishment of Bashar al—Assad?
We have to remember that we’re talk-
ing about people who are evil enough to
gas innocent children to prove a point.
At this stage, the understanding of basic
human psychology does not apply. It’s the
sameway the death penalty doesn’t deter
crime, according to the National Academy
of Sciences.,This fact was supported by

a committee of scholars associated. with

the National Research Council in a 2012

project.

In fact, a 2007 study by David S. Lee,
then of Columbia University, and Justin
McCrary, then of the University of Michi~

V gan, has shown that prison does nothing to

deter crime. The Pew Center’s Public Safety
Performance Project conducted an exten-
sive study on this question as Well, ﬁnding
thatall 41 US. states in the study failed to
deteryrepeat criminals through their use
of prisons.i__Whether or not these studies

apply to globa1—scale wars is a matter of
personal interpretation, but they certainly
weaken the core, blindly accepted belief
that punishment deters crime. This, how-
ever, is an appeal to reason, whereas, the
fear narrative appeals only to emotion -
and that’s precisely what is wrong with it.

Finding an example of when a lack
of retaliation has resulted in something
other than worldwide chaos is .impossible
because this “what if we don’t’.’ narrative

, has been used as a reason-for military in-
tervention for generations — from the

War of 1812 to the Gulf War.

I’m not proposing the hyperbolic al-
ternative that’s often juxtaposed with the
argument for retaliation: that we simply

,look the other way. Rather, I propose that

we intervene in a more productive, less
violent manner, or -— at the very least-
have a more direct target of force instead
of just haphazardly dropping a bomb. Most
of all, I’m arguing that political action be
based on substantial reasoning, rather
than empty propaganda.’ I

q New coachingstaff employs fresh, upbeat approach

Jeremy Tepper
Stcyff Wrz't¢r

The Pitt men’s "cross country team has un-
dergone numerous changes over the past
year. Between ﬁve freshmen and two new
assistant coaches, one might question the
team’s ability to make a seamless transition
from the Big East into the tougher Atlantic
Coast Conference. '
The upperclassmen, however, have em-
braced the change, and the new coaching
staff is leading the way.
‘Compared to the previous coaches, Jim

The majority of Pitt teams will hit the road
this weekend to continue their fall schedule.
In Pittsburgh, the women’s volleyball team
hosts the Pitt Panther Invitational.

Cross country, St. Vincent’s Invitational

The women’s cross country team will take
ashort drive to Latrobe, Pa., to compete in the
St. Vincent’s Invitational on Saturday. After
a third-place ﬁnish at the'Penn State Spiked
Shoe Invitational, the men’s team has abreak
this weekend. Despite this bye week, members
of the men’s team are still supporting their
female counterparts.

Freshman standout Wes Roberts, who had
two top—2o ﬁnishes this season, gave some

advice to the women running this weekend:
“Make the most of it, and make it worth it.”

At the team’s season opener, the Duquesne
Duals, the women’s squad went 2-1. The fol-
lowing weekend, the women — like the men
— placed third at the Penn State Spiked Shoe
Invitational.

Both races featured top ﬁnishes by fresh-
man Dee Dee Adams, sophomore Hillary Box-
heimer and juniorMorgan Perry. Adams made
a top—2o ﬁnish in both races, with times of
19:28 and 22:12

Women’s tennis, Navy Tournament

Pitt women’s tennis travels to Annapolis,
Md., Friday to compete in the Bill and Sandra
Moore Invitational. The tournament is hosted
by Navy, and several other teams — including

James Madison and George Mason — will be
in attendance. This will be the team’s second
appearance at the tl1ree—day tournament.

Last year, two titles were awarded to Pan-
thers: senior duojocelyn Lu and Taylor Wash-
ington won the doubles bracket while junior
Amanda Wickman claimed the singles title.
The tournament will be the ﬁrst match for
many players since the spring season.

“I think that we should perform well.
[We’ve] improved so much since last year,-
and we’re ready to go out there and compete,”
senior Kimmy Borza said.

Borza, a singles player, was number three
on the team and recorded a team—best record
of 14-7 for doubles play. -

Beingthe ﬁrst tournament of their season,

it will serve as a good predictor of where the
Panthers stand in comparison to their new
ACC rivals, w_hom theywillface in the spring.

Pitt softball plays its ﬁrst home game of

VOLLEYBALL

Senior duo welcomes changes that new season, coaching staff bring

Caitlin Hinsey
Satﬁ’ Wrz'ter _

Senior outside hitter Monica Wignot and
senior defensive specialist Maria Nicholas
have gone through alot together during
their four—year volleyball careers. This year
— their ﬁnal one inla Pitt uniform — has
provided the most change for both players.

The ﬁrst change the seniors endured
occurred when it was announced that Pitt
would become a member of the Atlantic
Coast Conference in 2013, allowing the
two girls to play in one of the nation’s most
highly competitive volleyball conferences
for one season.

The next change occurred last season
on Jan. 15, when the hiring of new head
coach Dan Fisher was announced. Wignot
and Nicholas had only ever played for for-
mer coach Toby Rens during their time at
Pitt, so the change would force them to ad-
just to a new system in their ﬁnal seasons.

But with all this change came great op-
portunities for Wignot and Nicholas. None
more important than the opportunity to
capture the one goal that has eluded them

so far: to win the NCAA Tournament cham- -

pionship. _
“The ACC is and will always be one of

the top conferences in the nation. To be

a good team in the ACC means you are

one of the best teams in the nation,” head —

coach Dan Fisher said. “Playing in that
league will prepare our team for the NCAA
Tournament.”
Nicholas shares the same thoughts.
“Our team goal is to deﬁnitely make the
NCAA Tournament,” Nicholas said. “We
have the potential to be great_even though

we are a younger team in the ACC. Our
short-term goal as a team is to remember
to play our game and knowing that we have
the skill to be a great team.”

Nicholas also believes that being a
member of the ACC is a step in the right
direction for Pitt and is “really happy that
[she and Wignot] get one year to play” in
the conference.

Last season, the team ﬁnished 17-14,
which landed it in a tie for sixth place in the
Big East Conference. The team lost in the

Big East Tournament and did not qualify '

for the NCAA Tournament. The team last

’ played in the national tournament in 2004.

Wignot is looking forward to playing
Maryland and Virginia Tech in conference
play just to see how the Panthers will fare
against them and “to see how they have
grown.” In the spring, Pitt defeated both
teams — along with American University
.— and won seven of the nine sets in which

the Panthers played.

Having the chance to play in such a
competitive conference allows Wignot
and Nicholas to help lead their younger
teammates in a new direction. Both hope to
leave a lasting impact on their teammates,
on and off the court.

One quality they hope their teammates
will emulate is the hard work and dedica-
tion that they give every day. -

“Just give it everything that you have
on the court and off the court, knowing
that you are representing Pitt volleyball
wherever you are,” Nicholas said.

Wignot mirrored these sentiments.

“I’m the type of person who leads a
lot by example,” Wignot stated. “Just a
lot of hard work, dedication, coming into

says. In fact, it’s uncommon for a member
of the team to be without a teammate at any
given time.

Since the freshmen all live together and
the upperclassmen have a cross country
house, the runners are constantly around
each other, often inviting fellow teammates
over to hang out. Having a close group pays
off during meets, Kisley says.

“When you’re closer to your team, you’re
more motivated to stick together, and you
want to do well for your teammates,” Kisley
said. “I feel like in past years we’ve been not
very close compared to this year.”

In times of duress during competition,
this close bond helps most.

“When you’re hurting, it makes it that
much harder to quit,” Addison said.

The coaches and players have been fairly
pleased with the results they’ve seen thus
far. Pitt’s ﬁrst competition came August 31,
when the team raced in the Duquesne Duals at

Schenley Park. The men’s squad ﬁnished 4-1,
with Addison ﬁnishing best amonghis team-
mates inﬁfth place. Kisley ﬁnished 13th, while
freshmen Wes Roberts and Chris Pastore
ﬁnished 17th and 18th, respectively.

This is a marked improvement, Lear said,
as Pitt ﬁnished much closer to Duquesne than
last year, placing three in the top nine, as op-
posed to not placing last year.

The team’s second competition took place
September 13th at the Spiked Shoe Invita-
tional, hosted by Penn State. Pitt ﬁnished
third, with ]uniorCullen_Davis leading the

way for Pitt at sixth place. Freshman Josh
Trzeciak ﬁnished 19th, while Pastore and
Roberts placed 20th" and 21st, respectively. L

Lear noted that the freshmen made sig-
niﬁcant progress between the ﬁrst and second
competitions, as mostranfaster at Penn State
than at Duquesne, even though the course is
longer by 0.23 miles. I

As the team continues to make progress,

Student transportation“ to football games in need of overhaul

Ryan Bertonaschi
Staff Wrz'ter

The University of Pittsburgh has reached
a critical point with its football program.

The population of the University’s
die—hard football fans, the majority of
which was introduced to Pitt football dur-
ing its glory days of the ‘7os, is naturally
declining. Whether the reason is loss of
patience, death or relocation, Pitt can no
longer rely solely on an older generation

_ for support.

Given Pitt’s jump into the ACC, now is
the worst possible time for this.

Some older fans commonly bash cur-
rent Pitt students for not showing up to
games. They also slam the ﬂocks that
sprint for exit signs after “Sweet Caro-
line.” Both are problems because of the
clear connection between student inter-
est and unprecedented success on the
gridiron. A wise man once said: Empty
yellow seats are instant turnoffs for high

school recruits.

Among the complaints, however, there
is a trend: Critics aren’t generally the
ones who have dealt with Pitt’s defective
shuttle system that transports students
to and from home games.

As a transfer student, I often heard
horror stories from students about catch-
ing a shuttle back to Oakland after a game.
Listening with a grain of salt, I always
thought the stories derived from college
men and women being, well, dramatic
young people. Turns out, those stories
were understated. I

After the Labor Day game against
Florida State, a line eight students wide
spanned from the ﬁrst shuttle all the way
to the corner of Reedsdale Street, which
runs parallel to Heinz Field’s north end
zone, and from there to North Shore
Drive, directly across from theT Plus
station. Two lines, formed inside the sta—
tion, wrapped around the building. It was

a similar story in town, where astound-
ingly long lines formed at bus stops along
Fifth Avenue.

I then realized I don’t blame students
for staying on campus.

Additionally, Heinz Field, home to
“the hottest home schedule in the coun-
try,” was not even at full capacity.

Obviously, times have changed. Ibe-
lieve students who have been enrolled
at Pitt over the past 13 years have fallen
out of touch with its football program.
Since the move from Pitt Stadium to
Heinz Field, going to football games has
become a more than 12-hour activity for
Pitt students, something desired by few
of them. If Heinz Field is Pitt’s perma-
nent ﬁx as a home stadium, something
must be done to ease the hassle of student
transportation before more students cut
ties with the 124-year tradition for good.

The Department of Athletics must vow
to make the trip to the North Shore as

accessible as a walk from Towers to the
Petersen Events Center. "

There are two potential sources of
solution: Pitt, or, more indirectly, Pitts-
burgh mayoral hopeful Bill Peduto.

Since joining the ACC, Pitt is now mak-
ing millions more annually because of
its new TV contract. My challenge to the
University: spend the difference on get-
ting students to games.

There are several possibilities that Pitt
could take on to make things better. My
favorite utilizes our city’s waterways. I
urge the department to send students to
the North Shore by way of ferry.

The route could begin at privately
owned land off Bates Street near the Hot
Metal Bridge. Yes, it would cost money to

, operate ferries, barter with landowners

to build a dock and use these companies’
land six times a year as an area for stu-

gry to reach these goals and bring furthe

that I am doing that and kind of respond
by doing the same.” l ‘

The hard work and leadership skills
they exhibit have also been reasons behind

. the successful seasonsthat Wignot and

Nicholas have had at Pitt.

Personally, Wignot looks to keep im-
proving as a player on the court and as a
teammate off the court. Last season, Wignot
was named to the second team A1l—Big East.

Aftermoving to middle blocker, she had an
average of 1.07 blocks per set game, ranking
her eighth in conference play.

Nicholas hopes to continue to be a posi-
tive inﬂuence on her teammates and hopes
for nothing more than the team to win.

While neither Wignot nor Nicholas have
immediate plans that include volleyball
after graduation, both admit that coach-
inglis something they might look into in
theirfutures.

“ [Volleyball is] always going to be a part
of my life one way or the other,” Wignot
said. I ’

dents to wait, but perhaps a deal could be
struck with Pittsburgh’s Gateway Clipper
Fleet and other local ferries to transport
students from this location. The concept
would lessen shuttle and Port Author-
ity bus and rail trafﬁc, ultimately putting
more students in seats and producing a
better product on the ﬁeld.

Aside from bringing in more buses or
building an on-campus stadium in the
half-acre of free space that Oakland has
to offer, this is'the most logical option.

If demands are not met here, Pitt fans
will have to wait a very long time until an
outside source accidentally conquers the
problem, that sourcevbeing Councilman
Bill Peduto.

Peduto is a bit of a mass transit guru.

He has been linked to several transpor-
tation studies-turned-blueprints, which
could put’more students and city residents
in seats on Saturdays.

In aprlevious interview with The Pitt
News’ staff writer Danielle Fox, he spoke
about an expansion of Pittsburgh’s light
rail intoand beyond Oakland. Such a
project would beneﬁt Pitt students, who
would be taken directly, to Heinz Field,
traffic-free.

Although Peduto swears the project
wouldn’t break the bank, it might never
happen. If it does, it could be completed in
time for ourchildren to attend the ribbon-
cutting ceremony.

Recessions and depressions cannot be '

judged until after the fact, and Pitt football
cannot afford to fall into the slightest of
the two. If Pitt allows this to become the
case, the University could be boasting its
nine national titles for a very long time.I

Party Protocol ;   s S

Nobody wants the police crashing the party, and

the easiest way to make that happen is to upset -the
neighbors by being too loud, having toosmany people
converging outside their home, or having strangers
damaging their property.

If you choose to havea party:

— Decide on a manageable number of guests;
be conservative and keep it small.

~ DO NOT post the party on Social Media
15 guests can become 50 very quickly.

«Notify your neighbors in advance and give them a_ name
and number of a responsible host to contact if they
have a problem. '. V

- Choose at least three sober hosts and assign-
their roles: ,

-. a dedicated bartender who will make sure that no
one gets intoxicated and minors are not served;

~ a “bouncer” to manage who gets into the party, and .
monitors the noise level outside; and '

‘- a social host who will stock food and nonalcoholic
beverages, keep guests safe at the ‘party, and
arrange transportation. ' , i

- Clean up immediately after the party to make sure
there are no cups or otherdebris scattered about 0

“the street. .
