I-F Ball Planned
For February 14
At William Penn

Council Hears Report On Dance,
Discusses Bowling Tourney
At Meeting Tuesday Night

The Interfraternity Ball will be
staged in the main ballroom of the
Hotel William Penn on the evening
of February 14, according "to the re-
port of Frank Frederick, C36, Theta
Chi, chairman of the affair, before In-
terfraternity Council Tuesda.y evening.

The complete I-F Ball committee, _in-
cluding the business manager, is yet

to be chosen, according to Frederick,
but a poll of fraternity opinion was
unanimous in approving the William
Penn asthe site for the dance.
Discussion relative to interfrater-
Dity bowling was begun when Martin
J. Feely, assistant professor of phys-
ical education, suggested that the
tournament be run off in one evening
of competition in order that plenty of
time could -be given to the basketball
race. A close division of council
favored.a continuance of the four-
week round-robin ‘tournament use.d for
the past three years, but a motion to
permit William Housel, C37, Delta.
Tau  chairman of the a.thletic
committee, to use his discretion in
varying the bowling procedure was
approved. Council voted to begin
bowling as soon as possible.

Recommendations of the men’s fra-
ternity committee, composed of fac-
ulty members, relative to the enter-
tainment of women in fraternity
houses was read by Phillip Andrews,
C36, Sigma Alpha Epsilon, vice pres-
ident, and I-F Council was given to
understand that only when chaperons
were present might women be enter-
tained within the chapter house. A
recommendation that, by concerted
fraternity action,_ one or two days a
week he set aside for inviting women
to lunch or dinner was not acted upon
by council.

The meeting was held at the Delta
Tau Delta house Tuesday, with An-
drews presiding in [place of Edward
Du rki n, .C136a,a..£E_{a;pp‘a' Sigma,---Dr.eside11t._
I-F Council will next convene on Feb-
ruary 4 at the Kappa Sigma fraternity
house on Dithridge Street.

“Opportunities for college-trained
men and women in go-vernme-nt serv-
ice” will be the subject treated at the
ﬁrst regular meeting of the George
W’. Curtis Club next Tuesday in Room
301, Alumni Hall.

Dr. Roger V. Shumate_ instructo-r in
political science, will address the
group, which is composed of students
enrolled in the government service
course.

Well acquainted with government
administration, Dr. Shumate spent
the summer of 1935 in Washington
where he studied the present political
structure of the nation.

Recent developments in national
government were reviewed in an ar-
ticle he wrote on the “Development
of National Administration, 1932-
1935,” for the October issue of the
American Political Science Review.
Another of his reports, “The Political
Philosophy of the New Deal,” appear-
ed in the Southwestern Social Science
Quarterly.

To arrange ﬁnal plans for the meet-
ing, the cabinet of the Curtis Club
will meet today in Room 225, Alumni
Hall, and to elect the chairman.

Members of the cabinet are: Mar-

Environment Of Specimens Important
To Exhibition, Says Jennings’ A rticle

An article, “Ecology in Museum Ex-
hibition,” by Dr. O. E. Jennings, head
of the department of botany, has ap-
peared in the current issue of The
Museum News, a publication of the
American Association of Museums. As
curator of botany of the Carnegie
Museum, Dr. Jennings has been in
charge of the botanical exhibits there
for 21 years.

In his article, Dr. Jennings empha-
sizes the importance of considering
the environment of animals and
plants in arranging them for exhibi-
tion. Systematic collections in mu-
seums, he says, suggest a rigid class-
iﬁcation rather than the continual
change which has always gone on in
nature.

Citing ‘Presque Isle. Erie, as an ex-
ample of this change, Dr. Jennings
says that the peninsula, six miles
long, is continually wearing away

along its western shore and building
out on the east, traveling along the
southern shore of Lake Eric at the
average rate of half a mile a century.
Vegetation on the isle must move at
an equal rate to keep up with its
habitat.

“Thus,” he continues, “if one could
have stationed himself on the eastern
point of Presque Isle 600 years ago
and could have stood there until now,
he would have seen marching past
him a procession of pla.nt societies,
headed by the beach and dune plants,
these followed successively by sand
plants (grass and cottonwood), bar-
berry heath, white-pine woods, red
oak woods, and hemlock and sugar
maple woods.”

The article was taken from a paper
read by Dr. Jennings at the annual
meeting of the American Association
of Museums at Toronto in 1934.

Inquiry Speaker Claims United States
Must Prohibit Loans To Stay Neutral

Tracing the steps which drew
United States inevitably into the
World VVar, and emphasizing the

probability of another war, Miss

Rose M. Stein, former member of the
Senate Munitions Investigating Com-
mittee, -speaking before Inquiry
Forum Wednesday noon, stressed the
necessityof absolute American neu-
trality in the ltalo-Ethiopian conﬂict.

Miss Stein reviewed the evidence
recently unearthed by the Senate
committee showing how America’s
entrance into the Vvorld War ﬁnally
became necessary to assure a victory
for the Allies and thus insure pay-

_rnent,.Qf loans_,made to the Allies by

Anierican bankers.

The Senate committee has come to
the conclusion, said Miss Stein, that
“no nation can remain neutral the
moment it lends a single dollar or
sells a. single shipment of arms to
be‘-ligerents.” If a country trades
with a warring nation, eventually it
will have to loan that nation money
with which to pay for supplies it has
sold the nation and ﬁnally it will be

drawn into the conﬂict to protect the

economic interests it has at stake.

German Classics
Feature Program

Famous Actor Presents Readings
Before Audience In Cathedral

Paul Dietz, eminent actor of the
American and European stage, before
a group of students and members of
the University faculty, presented dra-
matic interpretations of selections
from classical German dramas in Ger-
man and English. Mr. Dietz conduct-
ed his readings in Room 1309, Cathe-
dral, Wednesday afternoon.

Mr. ,Dietz introduced his readings
with summaries of the plays. His
first rendition was the famous solioquy
from the death of Wallestein in Schil-
ler’s famous trilogy of that name. He
followed this with Tel1’s monologue
previous to the death of Gessler, from
Schiller’s “Wilhelm Tell.”

Selections from Lessing’s “Minna
von Barnhelm,” from Schiller’s “Maria
Stuart,” and from Goethe's “Iphi-
genie” and “Faust” concluded the ren-
dition.

Mr. Dietz is an energetic speaker.
and interprets his readings with true
classical force.- He -has toured this
country, presenting his dramatic inter-
pretations, and has acted in the Ger-
man theaters in Chicago and New

York. He has also been connected
with the state theaters abroad.

He is now giving his time to recit-
tations before school groups, and he
has appeared in every state of the
union. His program Wednesday was
sponsored by the Carl Schurz Memor-
ial Foundation of Philadelphia.

Dr. Lohstoeter Plans
For Address Tonight

Dr. Lotte O. Lohstoeter, assistant
professor of modern languages, is pre-
paring two addresses, to be given to-
night and next Thursday, This even-
ing, Dr. Lohstoeter will speak before

Delta Delta Lambda, professional
commercial education fraternity, at
the Cathedral Mansions. The speech

will attempt to correlate the ﬁelds of
business and literature.

On Thursday evening Dr. Lohstoe-
ter .will address the Bayard Taylor
Unit of the Steuben Society of Amer-
ica_-at a,-meeting in honor of Bayard
Taylor, noted writer and translater of
Goethe's “Faust.” The speech will
treat on some phase of Mr. Taylor's
life.

United States ceased to be neutral
in the last war, Miss Stein claimed,
when the J. P. Morgan ﬁrm made its
first loan negotiations in 1914.-

Miss Stein emphasized the neces-

sity for passage of the present pro-
posed neutrality law, supplanting the
temporary neutrality legislation pass-
ed by Congress last year. The new
law would broaden the scope of the
present embargo to include the prohi-
biti_o_n not only of arms but of second-
ary materials necessary to carrying
on a war. Germany, says.Miss Stein,
lost the last war in spite of its well-
trained army through its inability to
obtain raw materials and supplies.
, In an informal discussion following
the speaker, Dr. B. J. Williams, pro-
fessor of political science, praised as
a great forward step in peace meas-
ures the recent legislation proclaming
that American citizens trading with
belligerents would do so at their own
risk.

The slow building-up of a uniﬁed
public sentiment against war, said
Miss Stein, might be the most effect-
ive road towards peace, since public
morale is as necessary to carrying on
a war as solders and supplies.

One Year Trial Period
Required Of New
Organizations

The executive committee of the
Student-Faculty Assembly completed
Wednesday an outline of procedure
whereby student organizations on the
campus may gain‘ ~the»-recognition of
the University and of SFA. A

This recognition, according to
Charles Ebert, C36, 3. member of the
executive committee, will give these

groups outlets through University
publicity channels, and will be instru-
mental in strengthening their organi-
zations. . .

Each club or organization must ﬁrst
submit an application to enter a ten-
tative or trial period of one year, dur-
ing Which SFA will observe its prog-
ress and attainment of purpose. After
this period, the group must enter an
application for ﬁnal approval, which,
if granted, gives it .recognition_fas an
established University organization.
Included in the application to SFA
for admission to the tentative period
must be a proposed constitution mod-
eled after a form recommended by the
executive committee. It must also
contain all other by-laws and regula-
tions not included in the constitution.
A list of proposed members and facul-
ty advisers, along with a complete ac-
count of any recent activities ()n the
campus or elsewhere must be sub-
mitted to the committee.

M ust State Need

Also required is a statement of the
need for such an organization at the
University, along with an account of
any proposed affiliations with other
University groups, and a planned in-
ternal organization with_ regard to
ﬁnance.

After the group has complied with
these qualiﬁcations to the satisfaction
of the executive committee and the
assembly, it enters a trial period of
12 months. Then it must submit to
assembly another application, this
time for ﬁnal approval. This applica-
tion must be made one month prior
to the expiring of the trial period.

In the request for ﬁnal approval of
SEF‘A, the executive committee requir-
es that a complete report of activi-
ties for the year be submitted, the re-
port to include the attendance of fac-
ulty and student members, the num-
ber and types of meetings, and a.
statement of the attainment of pur-
pose during the tentative period.

Any proposed changes in the consti-
tution, ﬁnancial statement .and pro-
posed budget, and a report of the
present and expected membership.
roll must also be included in the ap-
plication for ﬁnal approval. '

Coach’s Wife Dies

Mrs. E. J. Mazeski, wife of the new-

Chemists Come To Aid Of Historian
In Reading Mass Of Old Documents

With 13 months to go, the office of
Mrs. Agnes L. Starrett, assistant pro-
fessor of English, who is compiling
a history of the University, is .show-
ing signs of inspired activity. Room
108', State Hall, is crowded with ﬁles
of material for the book. Mrs. Star-
rett announces that her 45th ﬁling
case is showing signs of overcrowding.

From the maze of material in pro-
cess of organization has been found
several letters signed by the eminent
sc.ientist-a.lumnus of the University,
Dr. John, A. Brashear. The letters
were written to prominent Pitts-
burghers connected witlrthe Univer-
sity and the city, but the writing- was
too indistinct’ to. permit reading. From
the chemistry department came the
solution.

'fered Mrs. Starrett

The solution was that of sodium

sulphide, prepared by Dr. Alexander
Lovnj, professor of chemistry, which
proved after some experimentation
to be the only preparation that could
restore the writing. The letters,” it
was found, were carbon copies of the
ink originals. The carbon was a veg-
etable compound which has long since
gone out of use.

The letters were written during Dr.
Brashear’s chancellorship, 1901-1904.
Several were addressed to the Misses
Matilda and Jane Smith, who were
then connected with the Allegheny
Observatory./ The Smith cabinet now
in the University geology department
is the donation of the sisters.

The department of physics has of-
the use of its
ultra violet ra.y lamp, which will prob-
ably be used in deciphering many of
the indistinct documents.

Make Way For The Students

ODAY IS THE DAY for ambitious student
Taiitliors to present their pieces to a committee
of the Cap a11d Gown Graduate Club. Out of
these may come the script to be used in the all-

_male dramatic organization’s annual show this

spring. ' And then again it may not.
This sort of thing has been going on for more

‘years than you would bother about remembering.
-Cries for a. “student-written show” have been
heard ever since the first girlishly-attired bulky
155-pound sophomore lashed out with a Tiller
kick vicious enough to disarrange his blonde wig.

End Of The Trail

T HAD TO HAPPEN SOMETIME, and the
evening of January 8, 1936, was as good an oc-
casion as any. After all, 21 repetitions of the

same thin‘g“are' alot ‘of repetitions.- Obviously, this
concerns the breaking of the long victory string
which the Panther basketball players had been
running up at the expense of Carnegie Tech ’s
Tartans; »

There has never been a marathon yet which did
not come to an end, and just because the rivals
from across the hollow have upset the applecart
again after an unhealthily long time is no reason
-for a general sounding of alarms. Even the most
‘rabid of Pitt rooters willnot begrudge Tech folks
the glory that is rightfully theirs by virtue of their
team ’s great coming-from-behind battle to win that
ball game VVednesday evening.

It is rather for us to assure ourselves that. the
heavens have not fallen on the Pitt basketball
team and that it was downed by a Tech outﬁt that
showed plenty‘ of stuff. The fact that the pres-
sure, which became greater as each victory was
added to the heap, is now gone from this particular
series, should prove a good thing for everybody
concerned, a.nd particularly for Dr. Carlson ’s bo_vs.

Meanwhile, the only thing for the Panther
cagers to do is go right ahead and win ball games.
A triumph overthis Notre Dame outﬁt coming to-
night would be a great manner in which to start,

“Don’t marry while in college,” warns Walter Beck,
professor of psychology at Boston University. He says
the success of the matrimonial venture depends on the

Dr. Lanfear Please Note

The University of Texas, in an effort to bring the na-
tional convention of Sigma Delta Chi to its campus, sent
the president of the local chapter at Purdue University
a letter something like this: “Texas occupies all the
continent of North America, except a small part set
aside for the U.S., Canada and Mexico. If all the hogs
in Texas were one hog, he could dig the Panama Canal
in three roots and one grunt.”

From down in Texas, we get a collection of sorority
regulations. VVe often wonder what girls do a.t sorority
Here’s what they don't do.

HOUSE REGULATIONS

1. Girls will please wear both stockings when enter-
taining gentleman callers except on Sundays and hol-
idays.

2. Girls are absolutely not to date ditch diggers, col-
lege boys or other riff-raff.

3. Do not run your hand through your boy friend's
hair, then wipe your hands on the wallpaper. Even
dogs have pretty hair.

4. Always turn out lights at 9 o’clock even if your
visitor doesn't leave. We must cut down expenses.

5. Do not sit on your date’s lap. It puts wrinkles
in your dress.

They Would
There's aclass at Milwaukee State Teachers’ College
which has but two enrolled. Both students defy the in-
structor to apply the normal grade curve to the class.

Tie That!

The homecoming spirit of Colorado College was some-
what dampened when the students received a bill» for
$200 for railway ties which they swiped from a railroad.
The lads returnedthe several hundred ties and proceed-
ed to rebuild their bonﬁre pyre.

An Idea
Students at the University of Michigan may take out
flunking insurance. If the student thinks, the company
pays him enough money to go to the summer session.

Naughty!

Butler University in Indiana wouldn't let men and wo-
men belong to the same secretisoci-eties back in 1879 be-
cause it was suspected that one of the initiation rites
was a kiss. .

Air Hygiene Foundation Will Study
Problem Of Smoke, Dust Reduction

 

To sponsor the study of air hygiene
problems, dust and smoke, the Air
Hygiene Foundation of America has
been organized with headquarters on
the University campus.

Under the support of this founda-
tion, the Mellon Institute of Industrial
Research has begun an investigation
in which the hygienic, technologic,
and economic aspects of dust in in-
dustry will be studied.

H. B. Meller, member of the Uni-
versity faculty from 1909 to 1923, and
dean of the School of Mines from 1914
to 1923, will head the investigation.
Mr. Meller, an authority on air pol-
lution, has been in charge of the pro-

ROTC Plans New
Women’s Section

Honorary Patriotic Coeds’ Group
Proposed By Military Men

Plans for the “Guidon Company.”
an honorary fraternity for" women in-
terested in ROTC work, were disclos-
ed today by Herbert Platt, C36, co-
chairman of a Scabbard and Blade
committee which is sponsoring the

fraternity.

The University chapter will be at-
ﬁliated nationally.

The purpose, as announced in the
application for the charter, is “to re-
late ourselves (the women of the
University) more closely with the
work of our government, particularly
with those problems concerning na-
tional,de,fens,e;_ _to disseminate a ra-
tional understanding of these things
among those with whom we come
in contact; and to develop a type of
leadership which will best enable us
to aid our country.”

The maximum membership will be
1.6, to -be chosen from the junior and
senior classes. Because of the large
number of students here, exemption
may be granted from compliance with
the national constitution so that soph-
omores may also be admitted. The
ten honorary coed captains of the
ROTC, who will be selected at the
January 9 tapping of Scabbard and
Blade, will be charter members. The
remaining six will be named at the
April tapping, and the fraternity from,
then on will be self-perpetuating.

The only requirements are a “C"

grade average and an interest in
ROTC work.

General Business
Shows Decrease

Trade Advances While Production
In All Basic Industries Drop

j.According to last week's summary,
of the Bureauof Business Research,‘
the Pittsburgh district received its
ﬁrst severe "setback since the begin-
ning of October.

This was due, explained the Bu-
reau, to the sharp curtailment in oper-
ating schedules during Christmas,
week in many of the important indus-
tries in the district.

The major decline in business ac-e
tivity last week resulted from de-_T
crease in iron and steel production.
Steel mills in this district last week
were operating at only 34 per cent
of capacity, or about six per cent less
than the preceding week. Bituminous
coal production also showed a larger
than seasonal drop. On the other
hand electric power production re-
ﬂected a small increase.

Trade in the district last week was
fairly active, the index advancing
from 90.2 to 91.4. Department store
sales reflected a large increase after
Christmas, but sales for the week
were substantially higher than in the
same week last year.

Pittsburgh department stores did a
larger volume of business in 1935 than
in any other year since 1931.

Graduate Organization Shows Rise
In Aﬂiliations During Past
Several Years, Report

 

In spite of the lean years of the de-
pression, membership in the General
Alumni Association has been grow-
ing by leaps and bounds, and shows
promise of continuing to do so, accord-
ing to a report on membership statis-
tics prepared and issued by John VV.
Hallock, secretary of the organization.

Among the various constituent
groups listed in the report, the En-
gineering and Mines group shows the
largest percentage of constituency.
With a possible membership of 1943,
the group has a membership of 381 for
the 1935-1936 season to date, or 19.6
per cent, with 45 of last year's enroll-
ment not yet signed. This high per-
Centage is laid by Mr. Hallock to the
fact that these alumni were carrying
on their local groups during the inac-
tivity of the general association.

Next comes the Pharmacy group
with a total constituency of 2,516, 316
members, and 12.6 per cent. Of this
group, 25 are still out of the fold.

The Business Administration Alumni
Association ranks third with 11.5 per-
cent, or 225 out of a total of 1,959.
Of the Medicine group, 10.6 per cent
are enrolled. The membership is 94

; out of a possible 1,829.

College Ranks Sixth

Three hundred and ninety-four out of
4,523 alumnae belong to their circle,
for a constituency of 8.7 per cent.
These ﬁgures are somewhat high how-
ever, since many of ‘the women‘"als‘o
owe allegiance to other school groups,
and are also counted in these ﬁgures.

The largest school of the Univer-
sity, the College, ranks sixth on the
list. From 3,581 graduates, the group
has succeeded in enrolling 292 or 8.1
percent. This comparatively low ﬁg-
ure results from the lack of common
interests of its alumni, who hold such
a variety of interests, in the opinion
of the Alumni Secretary.

VVith the largest possibilities of all,
the Education and Graduate Associa-
tion, numbering a total constituency
of 4,866, is far down the list in sev-
enth place. It has a constituency of
7.3 per cent, or 354 members. The at-
torneys from the Law School report an
even hundred out of 1,518 for 6.6 per
cent. The Dentistry alumni bring up
the rear with 5.6 per cent, including
148 out of a possible 2,542.

Contest Proves Success

All these ﬁgures add up to a rather
imposing total. They show a total con-
stituency of 25,2-7!7, of whom 2,020 have
joinedlup with the association. The
constituency of the whole is 7.9 per
cent. Since most colleges draw about
25 per cent of. their living_ alumni, this
ﬁgure is quite low. LI-Iowev.r, to Mr.
IHa1lock, the ﬁgure is pleasing, since.
as he explains it, the Association was
down to the zero ﬁgure for many
years, and made this spurt in the de-
pression years- “To have staged that
comeback is very satisfying,” he ex-
plains, “but the ﬁgures also show that
we have a long way to go."

Mr, Hallock also announced that
the recent membership contest ob-
tained 451 new members, and net-
ted $1,350, outba‘ancing expenditures
by far, The statistics show that July

members. In July 1935, 525 came in.
Prior to July 1, only 399 were re-
ceived. After July the numbers of
new memberships-: slowly decreased,
August totaling 230 September, 204,
and October 178. in November, the
ﬁgure leaped to 433, the increase be-
ing accounted for by the returns of
the membership contest. Through
December 14, 51 alumni signed up
during the Christmas month.

Panthers Meet Another Team
Seeking, Revenge-—The Irish!

-Carnegie Tech Outﬁt Breaks Victory Spell Of Panthers
As Buzzy Greenberg, Diminutive Guard, Sparkles

 

For the second time in three 11igl1ts a basketball team stamps
‘into the Pitt Stadium intent on breaking a Panther jinx that has fol-

lowed them.

This time it is the Irish of Notre Dame coming to the

‘Stadium pavilion tonight to face the Golden Panther cagers in the
city ’s ﬁrst intersectional battle of the year.

First it was Tech, tonight it is Notre Dame, with a string of four
straight losses suffered at the Panthers’ claws during the last two

years.

Always noted for their
cage teams, the Irish are not used to
such treatment, and the array coming
tonight intend to put a stop to the Pitt
victory streak and start one of their
-own. ‘

And Well they might, for the Irish
this season sport one of the classiest
teams in the mid-west. Only one team
"has downed Notre Dame this season,
Purdue pulling the trick with a 54-40
victory. Of the remainder of the ten
teams faced, Notre Dame has defeat-
-ed nine and tied one, that game being
the unusual 20-20, tie with Northwest-
However, the Irish defeated the
‘Wildcats in an earlier game, 40-29$
These Wildcats are one of the two
teams holding decisions over the
‘Panthers, doing it with a 38-30 lacing.

Coach Koegan, with a string of fan-
-cy ball players to start, will probably
send the same lineup that faced
Northwestern in their tie game. This
calls for either Meyer or Moir at one

-of the forwards and co-captain John-

'ny Ford at the other, Marty Peters,
the other half of the captaincy, will
be at center, and Ireland and Wade
Blessed with a number.
-of good subs, Koegan will no doubt
use plenty of them in tonight's game.

On the other hand he will ﬁnd Dr.
Carlson also inclined to be liberal in
regard to the use of substitutes.
VVhether the ﬁrst or second team will
start is something only the good doc-

tor knows.

The Panther freshmen will play in
the preliminary game slated to begin
at 7 o’clock. Immediately following
the cub game, the varsity game will
go on.

Tech Breaks Streak

Nine years is a long time to wait
before winning a basketball game
from the Panthers. but Carnegie
Tech’s rangy ﬁve ﬁnally achieved
this long-sought ambition Wednesday
evening at the Stadium by grabbing a
34-29 victory, With three minutes re-
maining to play and the count knotted
-at 29-all, Buzzy Greenberg, diminu-
tive Tech guard, sunk a couple of neat
side shots to give his team the neces-
sary margin for its ﬁrst win in 22
starts against the Carlsonmen.

That wasn't all the ﬂashy little
guard did for the Plaid. On ﬁve other
occasions he looped in two-pointers
which enabled Carnegie to stay with-
in striking distance of the Panthers,
who were in the lead until nine min-
utes before the game ended. Green-
berg was like an iceberg; you had to
multiply his size above the surface
several times to realize what a power
he was to Tech’s offense.

The 34th Tech point was scored
after the ﬁnal whistle had blown.
Captain Ted Roderick fouled Billy
Miller just as the whistle blew. While
happy Tartan followers gathered
around the foul circle, Miller made
good in one of his two tries to run the
ﬁnal count to 34-29.

The second team started for the
Blue and Gold, and with nine minutes
gone in the ﬁrst half it had run up
a 11-2 total, the visitors failing to tally
a ﬁeld goal. Greenberg hit the basket
twice, and a foul by Captain Macalka
made it 11-7,. Then the Panthers
turned on the power, with ﬁeld goals
by Garcia and Johnson and a penalty
ﬂing by Roderick running the count
to 16-7.

Pitt Leads At Half

Greenberg rang the bell for two
points as did Patt on a long one from
the center of the ﬂoor. When the half
ended the Tartans had pulled up to
within three points of the Panther’s
16 total.

Lou Jagnow brought the score to
16-15 shortly after the ﬁnal half be-
gan. Johnson, Roderick and Jesko
ran the count to 24-15 before the dis-
organized Tartans took time out.
Vvhatever the Carnegie boys found in
that huddle seems to have been plenty
potent, for in the next ﬁve minutes of
play, they tied things up at 25-all,
the pesky Greenberg’s fourth two-
pointer doing the trick.

A foul shot by Jagnow sent the Plaid
into the lea.d, but Pete Noon connect-
ed for two poi-nts to return the lead to
Pitt. Gibson got _a ﬁeld goal and,Jag-
now another foul :.to give the Techs a
29-27 advantage, but Zeleznick tied
up the game at 29-all. From there on,
it was all Greenberg.

Sprint Trackmen
Improve Rapidly

Sol Menaker Makes Remarkable
Comeback After Leg Injury

Sprinters in the 50-yard event and
the qua.rter-mile monopolize the daily
practice shows in the track house as
they battle for positions on the Pan-
ther squad for the Millrose Games in
New York City, February 1.

Outstanding among the speed boys
is Sol Menaker, a senior with deter-
min=ation to make this a real come-
back year. An injury in Menaker’s
sophomore year left Coach Olson
minus one of his brightest prospects
in the sprint division.

Doctors pronounced Sol physically
unﬁt for further competition in the
spiked shoe sport after he was oper-
ated on to relieve a deep spike wound
on his leg. He had hardly climbed,

from his hospital bed until he return-=

ed for an appendicitis operation that
merely served to continue his retire-
ment.

However, Sol fooled even his track
mates when he reported for track
again last year with nothing more
than a will to come back. With Arvel
Fleming completely dominating the
century and furlong specialties, Men-
aker passed unnoticed during the
1935 outdoor season.

Menaker continued to work out,
and now with several months of in-
door training behind him promises to
ﬁt Fleming’s shoes during the later
indoor and outdoor campaigns in one
of the ﬁnest comeback roles in Pan-.
ther history. Olson recently claimed
“Menaker will go far since his re-
markable recovery.” .

Dick Mason, outstanding for the
freshmen last year and a. star of sev-
eral district meets during the sum-
mer vacation, rates the Number two
position behind Menaker. Edgar
Spitz, a speedy junior, rounds out the
ﬁrst trio on the varsity in this 50-ya.rd
event.

Both Harold Connelly and Art
Thomas are trained down _to_the low
50's in the quarter-mile, showing the
way to Andy Lasky, Charles Groat,
McConnell, and McMunn in the try-
outs for the mile relay team.

The half-m.ilers and milers have not
opened up to any great extent, spend-
ing most of their time in getting into
shape with building-up exercises and
long jogs about the short, cinder
track. Red Tost, George Cook.
Franklyn Theriault, Jack Emens, and
Alex Leggin, in fair shape from a suc-
cessful season of cross-country, look
good in the daily workouts.

Coaches Olson and Potts send the
entire freshman and varsity squads to
their marks for the initial shot that
opens the 1936 indoor season for the
Panthers on January 25 in the Uni-
versity-sponsored AMA champion-
ships.

Tentative Boxing
Lineup Selected

Dines, Smith, Paslowski Stand Out ;
Team Changes Training _P1ace

Along with a change in training
quarters, Coach Schricker announces
a probable starting lineup for the box-
ing team. Starters have not been
chosen in the 145-poundclass, hot bat-
tles marking ﬁghts in this class.

In the 115-pound class Mike Sivak
and Russ Vogel head the list of con-
tenders. Mike, a varsity man from
last year, is one of the more recent
additions to the squad. Al Paslow-
ski leads the ﬁeld in the 125-pound
class.

The 145-pound class is the only one
that is wide open. Herb Cummings,
John Stronko, and Ray Tomarelli have
the edge in this class to date. George
Dines is the favorite in the 155-pound
ﬁeld, while Art Leonard seems to have
the call in the 165-pound class. Cleon
Linderman and Lee Bechtel are two
of the 175-pounders who are ﬁghting
for the -position in their class with
Linderman having a slight edge.

Two football men, Frank Patrick
and Ted Schmidt, are contenders for
the heavyweight post, with Patrick a
slight favorite for the starting post.

Old Gridiron Heroes
Recall Former Glory

Dr. Bernard Clausen Makes Principal
Talk At Annual Football Dinner

Old time gridiron greats reminisced
with 1935 members of the Panther
grid squad at a banquet in honor of
their accomplishments during the past
football campaign last night at the
University Club.

Former varsity performers sat with
present squad members according to
positions: that is halfbacks were
grouped together, tackles were in an-
other section, and similarly for the
other positions on a football eleven.

Dr. Bernard C. Clausen, pastor of
the First Baptist Church, was intro-
duced by Toastmaster Floyd Rose as
the principal speaker of the evening.
Other speakers included Chancellor
John G. Bowman, Coach Jock Suther-
land, and Allen K. Collingwood, presi-
dent of the Varsity Letter Club,

A

Marty Peters, Irish basketball co-
captain, is the boy who booted the
Panther gridmen to defeat with a
last minute field goal in 1935. May-
be he'll get a field goal tonight.

Mat Squad Prepares
For Wolfpack Match

With the initial match of the sea-
son drawing near. Coach Ed Mazeski
is putting the matmen through some
strenuous workouts in preparation for
the opening match scheduled with
Waynesburg on January 17.

Coach Mazeski and Captain Russ
Bedillion are well satisﬁed with the
way the team has shaped up in prac-
tice. Since the boys practiced hard
during the holidays, the coach ex-
pects the team to be rounding into
form by the middle of next week.

Coach Mazeski announces that
places are not by any means cinched,
and he urges all candidates wishing to
try out for the team to report to the
Stadium this afternoon or Monday
afternoon. He especially would like
to see candidates for the 118-pound
class and the heavyweight division.

Coach Mazeski also announced that
he has applied with eight local high
schools for matches this winter with
the freshman team. All freshmen
wishing to try out for the frosh squad
report at the Stadium any afternoon
next week.

Panthers, Buckeyes Clash

Coach Pat Corr’s Panther swim-
mers, varsity and freshmen, open
their season tomorrow evening at the
Metropolitan pool with the powerful
Buckeye team from Ohio State form-
ing the opposition for the varsity, and
the city high champs, Fifth Avenue,
meeting the yearling outﬁt. The ﬁrst
event on the program will start at
8:15 o’clock.

Ohio State will bring to Pittsburgh
practically the same team that swamp-
ed the Panthers in Columbus last win-
ter by a score of 55-20. On that oc-
casion the Blue and Gold splashers
returned to the Smoky City with nary
a ﬁrst place to their credit and a
wholesome respect for the streng_th of
the Buckeyes. _
In Ed Kennedyfs, Intercollegiate

' Swimming Magazine the State team

is ranked as one of the ﬁve best ag-
gregations in the country. On Ken-
nedy’s All-American swimming team
for 1935 ﬁve Buckeye lads were nam-
ed. Bryant in the 100-yard freestyle,
Woodford in the distance events, and
Kirbert, Colville, and Sieg in the
breaststroke were selected. All of
these boys will perform tomorrow eve-
ning.

Bryant captured ﬁrsts in the 50 and
100 in last winter's meet against Pitt,
and Woodford accounted for initial
honors in the 440 and 220 freestyle
contests. Colville took ﬁrst in the 220-
yard breaststroke.

Coach Corr expects this dual meet
to be‘ not only the toughest one on
the schedule but also to act as a
tonic for what’s to come later on in
the winter against the Eastern Inter-
collegiate foes.

He W111 not select a lineup until to-
morrow night, however, it is probable
that Captain Lindberg, Locke, Jones,
Meyers, Anderson, Lavine, McQuillan,
Stiranko, Geyer, Madden, and Norton
will form the team.

Some of these men were late in re-

porting for practice and consequent-
ly will not be in top shape. Red Mc-
Quillan, former Schenley High school
star, was taken ill the other day and
may not be able to take his place
among the fancy divers.

The lists of events includes the 400-
yard relay, 220 freestyle, fancy div-
ing, 50-yard freestyle, 150-yard back-
stroke, 440—yard freestyle, 200-yard
breaststroke, and 100-yard freestyle.
Fresh and varsity events will be run
alternately.

Russ Lindberg opened his ﬁnal sea-
son on the varsity with a victory in
the 100-yard freestyle event in the
Senior AMA meet held last week.

The freshman natators like the var-
sity, will probably meet their toughest
opponent tomorrow evening in Fifth
Avenue’s classy outﬁt. Last year the
high school lads handed the yearlings
their only defeat of the season, and
the ﬁrst year team will be out to
reverse matters tomorrow.

Bernie Lelake, interscholastic title-
holder in the backstroke, Walt No-
wotny, Erie lad, Hyman Richman, for-
mer Fifth star, Bill Brown, fancy div-
er, and Hal Neff are expected to
make things interesting for the scho-
lastic team. Other freshman entries
will be Harry Heuple, Bob Stinner.
Steve Rodnok, Richard Raley, Bill Ohl,
Harry Harman, and Buerkle..-

A large crowd is expected to watch
the meet, the opening one for both
Ohio State and Pitt. Several of the
men who will compete are likely con-
tenders for place on the United States
Olympic team. An admission charge
of 25 cents will be charged.

each junior wom-an and ask her to
drag out any and all white elephants
which can be found at home, at grand-
ma’s, or the neighbors. They will
also contact other students and fac-
ulty members. Any and all rummage
will be accepted and should be
brought to the Heinz House.

With the proceeds of the sale the

cabinet hopes to replenish the class
treasury.
