‘N on-Proﬁt’
Ball Price

Senior Ball Price Cut Plan
Meets With Group
Approval

Exchange Starts May 24

Possibility of a reduction in the as-
sessment for the Senior Ball was an-
nouncedzyesterday. . by James Van:
Nostrand, Dent. '33, chairman, after
plans for conducting the ball as a
“non-proﬁt” social function had re-
ceived the unanimous endorsement of
the senior committee. The ball, pre-
senting Johnny Johnson and his or-
chestra, will take place Friday even-
ing, May 26, in the Hotel Schenley
ballroom

With the ticket price for the sea-
son’s last major dance already set at
$3.50, a new “low" for any Senior Ball
in recent years, Van Nostrand re-
vealed his committee's intention to.
cut the assessment to $3.00, if 250 re-
serve tickets are sold by the time set
for ticket exchange.

The deadline closing reserve sales
has been placed at 5 o'clock, Tuesday
afternoon, May 23. Exchange of
tickets will begin Wednesday morn-
ing, May 24, at speciﬁed points on the
campus. If the reserve sale reaches
250 tickets by Tuesday, each pur-
chaser of a reserve ticket will pay a
balance of $2.00, instead of $2.50, it
was announced.

In order that the price may be re-
duced to its absolute minimum—a fig-
ure approximating the actual budget
expenditure—Van Nostrand urged
members of all classes to purchase re-
serve tickets before next Tuesday.

“It is our true intention,” Van Nos-
trand stated, “to make this year's
Senior Ball a ‘non-proﬁt’ function, ex-
ercising every possible economy in ex-
penditures and, at the same time. inj
suring the presentation of a. dance
that is different—a social and ﬁnan-
cial success. _ ”

“Last year's Senior Ball, he con-
tinued, “placed its assessment at
$5.00, more than students could pay.
Drawing only a limited _ number of
students, it had a deﬁcit of $229.00.
We, this year, are not interested in
making money, on_ the ball. In fact,

effort to turn any proﬁts from our
present budget back to the students
who attend the dance.”

Decorations for the ball were near-
ing completion this week, he an-
nounced, and probably will prove to
be the most distinctive adjunct to the
affair. Reserve tickets were placed
oon sale last week and may be P111“
chased from any member of the com-
mittee.

Pitt-In-China
Drive Begins
Tomorrow

New Members of Mortar
Board and Cwens
to Sell Tags

 

 

Lasts Only One Day

 

The annual Pitt-in-China campaign
will take place tomorrow when the

new members of Owens and Mortar, ,

Board will sell tags on the campus."
The proceeds of the campaign will be
sent to the trustees of Lingnan Uni-
versity in China to be used to aid in
keeping three representatives of the
University of Pittsburgh there,

The representatives of Pitt there
now are Charles Siedle, '30, formei-_1y
editor of the Owl and member of Stu-
dent Council who is teaching English
there; Dr. Henry Frank and Dr.
Franklin Karcher and the wives of
the latter two.

The spirit of Pitt-in-China as seen.
by Walter Rome, -assistant. to the
dean of men, is in keeping with the
international spirit of the times.
China is giving her best in furnishings.
for the Nationality rooms in the
Cathedral, and it seems particulary
fitting that the University should be
represented in some way in China.

At the beginning of the year it was

undecided as to whether a campaign -

should take place. Some 75 students
were asked their opinions regarding
the wisdom of sponsoring_ the affair
and they decided that it should take-
place, being that it involved only vol-
untary contributions. ‘~

The student committee in charge of
the drive is composed of John
Bracken,‘ J. William Theis, Reed" Rose,‘-
William Edwards, Rose Marie Demes-
tichas, Dagny Olsen, Mary Lou Mc-
Connel, and Sara Dunmire, The con-
tinuation committee consists of Dean
Tliyrsa W. Amos, Walter J. Rome,
Miss Helen Battrick, J. G. Quick, and
W. W. Mendenhall. '

Dr. R. E. Turner Debates
With Noted Communist

Dr. Ralph E. Turner, associate pro-
fessor of history, and Jay Lovestone
of New York, editor o-f the Labor Age
and leader of the Communist party
opposition in the United States, de-
‘hated the question, “Resolved. That
the Western World is Ready for a
Workers’ Cooperative Common-
wealth,” at the Irene Kaufniann Set-
tlement auditorium Saturday even-
ing.

Lovestone advocated dictatorship
of the working class as a transition
step to a classless ‘society, whereas
‘Turner declared that a workers’ rev-
olution is at present impossible be-
cause “the peasant mentality” of six
thousand years is too inherent to be
won over by the Communists.

Dent Elected
  -.Honorary Head

Mechanical Engineering Head
Honored by ASME

Professor John E. Dent, head of
the department of mechanical engi-
neering, was elected to succeed H.
C. Pavian, aeronautical engineering
instructor, as honorary chairman of
the student branch of the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers at
a meeting Thursday morning.

Professor Dent served as honorary
chairman of the ASME from 1929 to
1932. A clause in the constitution
of the society which restricts the
term of office to no more than three
consecutive years made him ineligi-
ble for re-election last year.

Two student heads were also se-
lected for the organization for next
year. Phillip M. Smith ’34, a meni-
ber of Sigma Tau, honorary engineer-
ing fraternity, of Scabbard and Blade,
h0I101‘-aI‘Y military fraternity, and a
member of the cabinet of the Engi-
neering Association this semester,
has been elected chairman of the
ASME. The new vice chairman is
Paul Hykes ’34, who served in the
Engineering Association cabinet last
semester and who was tapped for
Scabbard and Blade at the recent
Spring Festival ceremonies. Addi-
Eiolnal officers will be elected next
a .

At Thursday's meeting, E. H, R.
Pegg ’33, chairman of the society this
year, delivered a short farewell talk
to the group on behalf of the outgoing
administration. Pegg, who has been
honored as the outstanding senior in
the Engineering School, was also
president of the Engineering Asso-
ciation this year.

man of Thursday's session, announced
that instead of a meeting on Thurs-
day. May 18, the junior class would

lurgy department.

Harry Joyce and C. Steinacker, both
metallurgy ’34, were appointed as
chairmen for the social hour.

At this time, Dr. Robert Fisher,
graduate student in metallurgy, will
speak. Moving pictures will also be
‘shown.

Oberlin Head Gives
Address On Peace

Ruth Bowser, Joseph Phillips Got
Outstanding Awards

 

More than two hundred students
were tapped in the annual scholastic
Honors Tap Day exercises, which
took place in the auditorium of the
Twentieth Century Club Friday att-
ernoon.

Among winners of Individual hon-
ors were Ruth Bowser, recipient oh
the City Panhellenic Scholarship for
superior scholastic standing, and
Joseph Phillips, who was awarded
both the Phillips Medal, recognizing
the highest ranking student in the
department of chemistry, and mem-
bership in the American Chemical
Society.

Dr. Ernest Hatch Wilkins, presi-
dent of Oberlin College, speaking on
“The Scholar and Peace,” showed
the relationship between the college
student and the present widespread
peace movement, and outlined possi-
ble courses which the anti-war move-
ment might follow.

“The process of fragmentation—-
the breaking up of a militant minor-
ity into warring factions——-has worked
too well in the peace campaign,” de-
clared the Oberlin president. “Our
greatest need is a uniﬁed body which
will include all present paciﬂst
groups, and which will truly seek
world co-operation.” He further pro-
posed an extensive educational cam-
P3-ign in every department of Amer-
ican colleges for instruction in peace
—“monotonous, yes—but less monot-
onous than life in the trenches,” he
asserted.

The Margaret Enright Memorial
Award, presented by Kappa Chapter
of Theta Phi Alpha, women's social
fraternity, was won by Virginia
Hutchins. To the sophomore in the
department of chemistry with the
highest average in his freshman
Year, Marcus S. Morgan, was given
the Phi Lambda Upsilon Award. In
addition, Sigma Kappa Phi, honorary
foreign language fraternity, honored
four outstanding‘ seniors in each of
the four major language ﬁelds: Ruth
Staples, Spanish; Claire Van Der
Hoeven, Latin; Eunice McClurkin,
French; and Elizabeth Hleiss, Ger-
man.

of the assembly, and introduced
Chancellor John G. Bowman, who in
turn presented Dr. Wilkins. Dr. Alex-
ander isilverman, professor and head
of the chemistry department, an-
nounced the chemistry awards, and

Trackers, 72-63

Judges Dispute Over Century
Dash Settled by Camera;
Keller High Scorer

 

 

High---Cubs Win

Barnum

 

'A mix up over the “century” deci-
slon; a little rain, a sloppy track, and
the track teams of Pitt and Penn
State usually equals a Penn State
victory. The formula worked to per-
fection at the Stadium on Saturday
afternoon as the Nittany trackers de-
feated the Panthers, 72-63. The State
frosh were not so fortunate, losing
to Len Barnum and the Pitt fresh-
men, 74 1/3-60 2/3.

The argument over the century
dash, which was only settled by
newspaper photos of the ﬁnish,
placed Arvil Fleming, Pitt ﬂash, in
first place, after the judges had
-failed to place him among the vic-
tors. Although Fleming was clocked
first ‘by the timers, the judges an-
nounced the winner as Aldridge,
State, placing Seigel, State, second,
and Jacobson, Pitt, third. After a pro-
test by the timers, the decision was
held up, pending the development of
the picture, which clearly -showed
Fleming to be the w,inn,er._‘ _

-‘Captain Bill Keller was high point,
man of the; day, winning‘ both the.
440 and 880 runs. In the 880, Keller
-outran Captain Dunaway, for the ﬁrst
defeat of thte State captain in dual
competition. Howard O’Dell upset
the dope to win the pole vault, clear-
ing 11 feet 4 inches.

In the ﬁeld events, Craft, Bonavita,
Sebastian. Sayland, and Gongloff
turned in Pitt victories in the discus,
shot-put, broad jump, high jump, and
hammer throw respectively.

Pitt, Ta rta n
Track Squads
Clash Today

Result Uncertain as Panthers
Meet Carnegie in Stadium
Contest This Afternoon

 

 

Pitt Strong In Field

 

No matter how good a Tech track
team may be, and no matter how bad
a Pitt track team may have appeared
in previous competition, the outcome
of a Pitt-Tech track meet is largely
a matter of guess work.

It is quite possible that such a con-
dition will prevail today at the Sta-
dium as the Panther trackers play
host to the Tartans. The meet, or-
iginally scheduled for the Tartan
Bowl, was transferred to the Stadium
because of the size of the Tech ﬁeld.

Last year the Tartans, with one of
the strongest teams in their history,
were upset at the Stadium, and this
year, with neither team having turn-
ed in any impressive showings in
dual meets, the Panthers appear to
hold an edge. In the ﬁeld events, es-
pecially, the Panthers hold a big
edge, as the Tartans can hardly hope
to match the performances of Bona-
vita, Gongloff, Craft, Vale-nti, 0’Dell,
Sebastian, and Fleming.

Led by Captain Tom Coulter, main
cog in the Tartan machine, and a
competitor in the dashes as well as
the hurdles, the Tartans may pile up
sufﬁcient po-ints to make the going
rough for Coach Olsen's speeders.
Olsen, however, will have Keller,
Fleming, Schlossberg, Clise, Wattkins,
Albright, Kirkpatrick, and Guay.

Keller should easily outrun the
Tech talent in the 440 and 880, and
Guay may give Coulter more opposi-
tion than is expected in the hurdles.
Pitt also holds an edge in the longer
dashes, with Kirkpatrick and ‘C-Vageir
houser probably leading the pack.

All in all, the outlook is not so good
for the Tech trackers, a11d,.unless,

' the battle front undergoes‘ a sudden

change, the Panthers will win their
ﬁrst dual meet without much trouble.

Coercion Cannot Suceeed

FRESHMAN regulations, buried as a hopeless program two
semesters ago after repeated attempts at enforcement had
failed, today are receiving the serious consideration of a new

T and ambitious Student Council.

At their ﬁrst meeting last Wednesday night, the recently
elected legislators gave tentative endorsement to a plan for the
enforcement of anew code of freshman customs and regulations.
The plan as submitted‘ to couiicil by’ Druids," honorary sopho-
more activities fraternity, would prohibit any freshman who
had not satisﬁed certain customs requirements from participat-
ing in campus activities.

Druids, as sponsors of the scheme and as its agency of en-
forcement, would require all ﬁrst-year men to learn University

' songs and football yells, and to acquaint themselves with our
f venerable institution's traditions. The fresh would‘ also be
' called upon to recite pertinent facts of information concerning
‘ undergraduate. activities, administration members and campus
'1 . geography. ‘
§ “Know your University—or else!” apparently would be the
’ ultimatum issued to each incoming male.
‘_ The adoption of the entire scheme, of course, hinges upon
* the complete cooperation of all student activities. Even council
' and the Druids realize it would be futile to introduce the pro-
‘ gram if the heads of activities refused to close their organiza-
tions to those freshmen who had not earned “silver buttons.”
Council should be informed now that only a negative reac-
tion to the plan need be expected from activities leaders. Be-
cause of their past observation of attempts at regulations en-
forcement, the more experienced of these student executives
would refuse to pledge their organizations to a program of
coercion. '
Obviously wise to at least one group reaction, the framers
of the plan have excepted one branch of activities from the ne-
cessity of meeting its requirements. Athletes, of course, it was
pointed out by individuals, could not be expected to comply with
the provisions of the “button” plan. It was intima.ted—sur-
prising insight !—that the athletic department might balk at
the possibilities of such a wholesale disruption of its major
sports schedules. This angle of the problem offers priceless
opportunity for humorous comment.
Conceived by one member of Druids in a. spirit of blinding
enthusiasm, the plan has received, at best, only a. half-hearted
support. It is a foregone conclusion that the enthusiasm will
- pass with the ﬁrst attempts at enforcement, and that another
‘ regulations ﬁasco wﬂl be sent to the University administration

for oﬁicial consignment to the political junk-heap. That should
‘ not come to pass.
‘ Student Council is in a. position today to demonstrate its
qualities of leadership by the manner in which it treats this
issue. It would hardly be an over-statement to say that, in
effect, the reputation of next year’s governing body depends on
the handling of the question.

For obvious reasons, the plan should be spiked by council.
Whatever enthusiasm remains might then be applied in intensi-
 fying the present program carried on by upperclassmen advis-

ers. It is time we are learning that education to University
spirit can never be accomplished by coercion.

THESE are the times when two one-dollar bills look like a bundle.
And not to be wondered at in this period of popular optical illu-
sions is the blowing of trumpets and the shouting of “good times
ahead” when the business indices show a slight rise.

There has been a deﬁnite improvement in business in the past
Steel production, electric power production, cotton
goods production, and freight car loadings have shown an upward

trend.
sure signs of improvement, it might
not be aside from the point to in-
quire how much of this “improve-
ment” is genuine and how much is to
to be attributed to the temporary ef-
fects of inﬂation, especially the an-
ticipated price rise.

It may be, of course, that recovery
is at hand. It may be that we have
reached the bottom, and that, bounc-
ing hard, with the stimulating eﬂect
‘of a currency and credit inﬂation plus
the anticipated results of .a public
works program, we shall move up.

What is coming Next?

Even the milder critics of the pros-
perity of the twentites are vehement
in their hopes that the cycle ending
in a grand. crash will not be repeat-
ed. I, think there is_' no one optimis-
tic' enough‘ to predict the possibility
of such a, thing. We may be headed
for a new prosperity. But we aren’t
going to get the old Republican va-
riety.

I would not imply that our eco-
nomic institutions have now been put
on a sound basis, and that now, with
the ship in order, we are ready for
operations on a sound basis. On the
_contrary, political meddling has nulli-
ﬁed many of the purging acids which
depression normally applies to busi-
ness enterprise. An-example of this
is to be found, I ‘believe, in the ac-
tion of the R. F. C. under Hoover in
connection with the railroads.

Many, if not most, of the railroads
are over-capitalized. The ﬁnanciers
who launched them watered the stock
until it represented twice their real
value. The defects of such an over-
capitalization, apparent for some
years, produced a crisis when the
crash came. Instead of letting the
weak roads become bankrupt and re-
organize on a sound basis, the R. F.
C. handed out money by the ﬁstfull,
apparently believing that the day of
reckoning for corporations with
watered stock had not yet arrived.

Deferred Reorganizations

Nothing of the sort was true. From
a sound capitalistic viewpoint, an
amputation was necessary. Consid-
eration of this over-capitalization has
been taken in the new railroad bill
to go before Congress soon. In it
there is provision for rate determina-
tion not upon the value of road prop-
erty as was formerly the case, but
upon a basis of operation costs.
Whether or not this new rate making
basis will beneﬁt shippers is yet to
be determined by the attitude taken
by the Interstate Commerce Commis-
sion. One thing is certain however—
that cuts in stock dividends and
threatened bond defaults will not be
welcome to the holders of those se-
curities.

In this railroad legislation there is
a. strong hint of the basis on which
we are going to get business recov-

. . . and in the mode of 1933, they are
offered at the low Tourist’ Class rate, for

the highest class on the ship!

It’s the modern idea . . . the low Tourist
rate for the ﬁnes: on the ship— the best

of the ship. Just notice these rates:

While these are relativelyé

ery, if we get it. The hint lies in the
merger provisions of the bill.

For some years the growth of bus-
iness units has been startling. The
increasing trustiﬁcation of industries
has been done in sure violation of
the Sherman Act and its trust-busting
successors. But nothing was done
about it. The movement was winked
at. Now we have a recognition by
the administration of this trend. We
not only have a recognition, but, in
the case of railroads, a deﬁnite en-
couragement. As for other indus-
tries, there have been strong White
House appeals for the lifting of the
restrictions on large combinations.

Government and Association Control
There is, for instance, Roosevelt's
plan for the regulation of production
and the stabilization of prices
through the trade association. In
this matter of industrial regulation

throughthe trade association, it is in-

teresting to note that up to now both
the Supreme Court and the Federal
Trade Commission have fought "and
often stopped these organizations in
their attempts to do the very things
which the President now proposes as
their ﬁrst duty.

Unless my eyes are deceiving me,
American business by such tactics is
moving at an extreme pace toward
the sort of organization that has come
to mark European enterprise. The
trade association, as proposed by
Roosevelt, 18 the European cartel. A
cartel is proposed ‘now for the petro-
leum industry; and with the appa-
rent support of the oil men them-
selves, the formation of such a gov-
ernment sponsored and privately op-

socialistic in character is the farm
relief bill whose trust features are
well known to everyone by now—with
the exception of two great newspaper
editors I eavesdropped on in Wash-
ington recently.

Mr. Hoover's rugged individualism
has turned out to be such a ﬂop that
even our big business leaders know
it. In fact, they are begging the Fed-
eral government to do something
about it. VVe have the oil men, the
coal operators, and the industrial
giants in a hundred other ﬁelds com-
ing hat in hand to Washington and
saying, “Please protect us from each
other.”

Depression Accounting

Without government encourage-
ment, and often in spite of discour-
agement, the movement toward the
single trust in a particular commer-
cial or industrial ﬁeld has gone on.
American Telephone and Telegraph
has swallowed its competitors. The
public utilities have been joined in a
great network by holding company
ownership. With the chain store
movement going full blast, that will-
o’-the-wisp, the independent merchant,
is walking off the scene. To a large
degree depression halted the march
toward mergers. But deﬂation work-
ed powerfully to affect a. further con-
centration of wealth. That other
will-o’-the-wisp, the little fellow, lost
his home-—-the mortgage company or
the bank got it. He lost all the
stocks he had on margin. Unless he
was exceptionally lucky, his other in-
vestments went at suicidal prices.

Ever since large corporations began
going bankrupt the.,busy individuals
who ‘take ‘advantage of low stock
prices have been grabbing control in
one outﬁt after another. There is,
for instance, one group of such buy-
ers who have specialized in invest-
ment trusts, buying up, indirectly,
large blocks of stock in our ﬁrst in-
dustries. The concentration of wealth
which shocked us in the twenties will
look like small stuff when the ac-
counting of the thirties is made.

If we are really getting recovery at
last, I think we should make no er-
ror in realizing that the normality
will not be of the old variety._ From
one viewpoint,‘it will not be even as
good as the old variety. But good or
not, it is sure that the rich will be
richer than ever. And, important as
anything could be, we are rebuilding
