‘The World   of Giving’
lists naming opportunities

ERIC LIDJI H
Senior Staff Writer

On Nov. 27, University spokesman Robert Hill
told The Pitt News that naming rights to Pitt’s buildings
are “not sold.” “We’re not selling anything,” he said.

But the next day, The Pitt News acquired a list sent -

to prospective donors that lists prices for the naming
rights to numerous campus buildings. The list is the lat-

est effort by Pitt to meet and exceed its Capital _

Campaign fundraising goal.
. Pitt launched the Capital Campaign last year. It is
a ﬁmdraising drive with the goal of raising $500 rnil—
lion by June 30, 2003. The Office of Institutional
Advancement is one group responsible for collecting
donations to the University through the campaign.
The fall 2001 installment of “The World of
Giving,” a publication sent to prospective donors by
the Office of Institutional Advancement, armounced
the Capital Carnpaign’s plan to launch “new naming

- opportunities.”

The article contains a list of available naming

opportunities, including 25 campus buildings, depart-*
ments, chairs and fellowships, and the donation
amount for naming privileges. '

Naming rights to School of Medicine have a listed
price tag of $100 million. Others on the list include the
Masonic Temple and the University Honors College,
priced at $25 million and $20 million respectively. The
list goes all the way down to sports lockers, for $2,500
each.

In an interview on Tuesday, University spokesman
Robert Hill said that the naming of University build-
ings is honorary, noting that Wesley W. Posvar Hall and
Litchﬁeld Towers are both named for former chancel-
lors. -
“We’re not selling anything. I’m not going to dis-
cuss that list,” Hill said.-“Narning rights are not sold.”
He added that copies of “The World of Giving” would
not be distributed to the press.

The Katz Graduate School of Business, though,
was named after Joseph M. Katz, who donated $10

Fraternity  
faces hazing
charges

DAVE HARTMAN
News Editor

»

The Alpha Epsilon Pi ﬁatemity will face judicial board charges
alleging that some of its members engaged in hazing. The charges
stem from an incident earlier this week when city police were called
to the fraternity president’s apartment.

Shortly before midnight Tuesday, two city police oﬂioers
respondedto a report of “ﬁve males ﬁghting, one wielding a base-
ball bat,” according to a city police report The report states oﬂicers
were met at the door by Lyle Sclair, a Pitt student and resident in
Bates Hill apartments, where the incident occuned.

According to the report, police questioned Sclair about the
reported ﬁghting, but he was “very evasive in his answers” and
“would contradict himself when ﬁnally responding.”

Police said Sclair told oﬂicersthere had been a struggle in the
apartment, but would not comment on the presence of a baseball bat.
He then told the officers ﬁve more men were hiding in the apart-
ment’s bathroom. I '

Sclair, the newly elected president of the Alpha Epsilon Pi ﬁa-
ternity, told The Pitt News he was entertaining a number of guests,
many of whom came and left freely that night. But he said there was
never a struggle or ﬁght, there was not a baseball bat in his apartment
and at no time did men hide in his bathroom. .

According to the police report, the oﬂicers asked Sclair to call
the men from the bathroom, and watched as ﬁve white men wearing
blue jeans and plain white T—shirts walked into the living room.

The ﬁve men were unable to provide identiﬁcation, police said,
and told the officers Sclair had previously taken their Pitt lDs from
them. According to the report, Sclair told the oﬂicers that he didn’t
have the IDs, but that another fraternity member was in possession
of the ﬁve IDs. '

According to Sclair, the-IDs were taken earlier in what was a
typical prank to get on ﬁiends’ nerves and it was not related to the
ﬁaternity or hazing in any way.

According to the police report, the officers learned from Sclair
that_he -is the president of Alpha Epsilon Pi, and that the ﬁve men
were pledges to the organization, completing their ﬁnal day of pledg-
mg.

Sclair told The Pitt News that his guests that night were a mix-
ture of pledges, ﬁatemity members and ﬁiends. He said there were
no pledge activities going on.

Police then directed Sclair to contact whoever was in possession
of the students.’ identiﬁcation and have the IDS retumed irnrnediate—
ly. According to the police report, while oﬂicers waited for the IDs
to arrive, they noticed a weight attached to the end of a rope. A

“Sclair reluctantly explained that this was part of the pledge rou-
tine, and that the rope was tied to the outstretched arm of a pledge,”

Putin pardoned PSU professor

DANIEL MASNY
The Pitt News

Edmund Pope was arrested in his
Russian hotel room one year and eight
months ago, taken to prison, and placed 
solitary conﬁnement. He didn’t know why.

Eight months later he was convicted of
stealing secret infonnation about submarine
missiles, and then pardoned by the Russian
government.

Pope, a professor at Pemisylvania State
University, spoke about his experiences in
Russia yesterday in the Teplitz Memorial
Courtroom at Pitt’s School of Law. Pope
was incarcerated from April 3 to Dec. 14,
2000, during which time he was interrogat-
ed, tried, convicted and sentenced to '20
years hard labor. - .

“I was expecting the ordeal to end at
any minute, but it didn’t,” Pope said about
the ﬁrst days of his interrogation. “l ﬂiought
it was a joke. I knew I hadn’t done anything
wrong, so I didn’t take it seriously.”

Pope described how he was kept in soli-
tary conﬁnement the ﬁrst few days after his
arrest and was interrogated, sometimes for

18 hours a day.

Pope said the government was looking
for a show trial.

“I just happened to be a good target,” he
said, referencing his 20 years as a naval
intelligence oﬂicer. _

Pope said he blamed Russian President
Vladimir Putin for his detention, saying that
Putin is taking Russia in the wrong direc-

tion.
‘There is no free press in Russia. There

- was only a little a year ago, but now there is

none,” he said.

Pope was working in Russia on busi-
ness for Penn State, exchanging information
legally through the University of Moscow
for the’ applied research lab for which he
worked.

Putin pardoned Pope twice before he
was released. According to Pope, hard—line
oﬂicials in the govemment kept Putin from
following through with the pardon, they
wanted to ﬁnish the trial in an attempt to
save face. Pope said that political pressure
from the United States kept mounting. A bill
called the Peterson Bill demanding Pope’s
release and pardon unanimously passed the
House of Representatives, and a similar bill
also passed the Senate. Pope said President
Clinton himself had asked Putin to return
Pope to American soil. ‘

Pope said that while in prison he grew
to hate his captors, and told the audience of
what he and other inmates would do to irri-
tate and get back at them. Pope and a friend

named Pavel would speak in Swedish, a lan- X

guage they coincidentally both knew, so that
only they wo11ld understand. -—

“It drove them nuts,” Pope said, sInil—
ing. Pope also told of a fellow inmate who

‘would sing “God Bless America” at the top
.of his lungs when the govemment—owned

television stations would come to the prison,
so that it could be faintly heard on the broad-
cast

million in 1987. About the naming of that
building, Hill said Tuesday, “That is the
only example.” _

After obtaining a copy of “The World

of Giving,” The Pitt News was told.

Wednesday by Ottie Lee in the Oﬂice of
News and Information that neither Hill nor
the office would comment further on the
naming rights. .

Gerard LaVan, an associate vice chan-

' cellor of institutional’ advancement and
national campaign manager, says in “The”

World of Giving,” that in the past, building
names were bestowed as a commemora-

tion or for honorary reasons, but “there was .
never a systematic attempt to provide these

opportunities to alumni and frien .”

On the University Web site, the Oﬂice‘

of News and Information published an arti-
cle dated Nov. 16 and headlined, “Rite Aid
Funds Pitt School of Pharmacy Laboratory
Renovation.” yThe story details how the

Rite Aid Corporation recently donated '

$100,000 to Pitt’s School of Pharmacy to
support the renovation of the Rite Aid
Edward C. Reif Memorial Laboratory in

' Salk Hall. I
As well as buildings that have yet to be _

named, such as the Masonic Temple, “The

World of Giving” names ﬁve different’

instances of past donations leading to nam-
ing opportunities. They include the $10
million donation from John and Gertrude
Petersen that led to the naming of the
Petersen Events Center and a $1.3 million

U.S. discourages peacekeeping missions, for now  

ALAN SIPRESS AND PETER FINN
The Washington Post

U.S. Central Command, which over-
sees the war in Afghanistan, has put the
brakes on the imminent deployment of
thousands of international peacekeepers in
areas freed from Taliban control out of con-
cern this could encumber American rnili—
tary operations, Bush administration ofﬁ-
cials said.

This decision has left" - several’ allied
governments, including Britain, France,
Canada, Turkey and Jordan, in limbo after
they readied their troops for duty earlier this
month primarily to help speed humanitari-
an aid as winter closes in on Afghanistan.
Gen. Tommy Franks ruled it was premature
to accept these offers of assistance while he
is occupied with pressing the military oper-
ations, ofﬁcials‘ and diplomats said. '

His opposition to the immediate V

deployment of peacekeepers comes even
as one obstacle tothe creation of an inter-
national ' security force was removed
Thursday when the Northern Alliance said
it was dropping its objections. The alliance,
which controls more than half of
Afghanistan including the capital Kabul,
said it could accept international peace-
keepers as part of an overall agreement on
the shape of an interim administration to
replace the Taliban.

Pulling back from apparent crisis,

THE PITT NEWS

negotiators from the Northern Alliance and
three other Afghan factions meeting with
U.N. sponsorship in Germany, moved
toward a deal on a future government for
their country. They reached broad agree-
ment on the shape of an interim authority
and began detailed discussions on who
might serve in it, according to accounts
from the c1osed—door talks. ‘In another
important shift, the alliance said it could

accept a role for the country’s former king T

Moharnrned Zahir Shah.

“Today I’m more optimistic than yes-
terday about a peaceful solution,” said
Yonus Qanooni, head of the Northern
Alliance delegation. He said a bad transla-
tion was to blame for his apparent dismissal
Wednesday of proposals for a peacekeep-
ing force and a role for the former king;
Those statements led to predictions that the
conference would reach a deadlock.

But the alliance’s newfound willing-
ness to accept international peacekeepers is
not likely to prove decisive in Franks’
thinking, administration oﬂicials said.

Though several U.S. allies have urged
a quick response to help provide relief and
stabilize a volatile political situation,

‘administration officials said the deploy-

ment of peacekeepers would further com-
plicate what is already a complex war
effort. Offers by allied governments to dis-

, patch soldiers to Kabul, the Bagram airﬁeld

north of the capital and the northern city of
Mazar—e—Sha1if, considered a crucial hub

for humanitarian aid, are now on hold.
“Whatever piece they’reoffering does-
n’t work at this time,” Quigley said. “You
take them up on their offers at the location
and time and manner that ﬁts into the over-
all fabric of Enduring Freedom .. . The best:
intentions in the world, if provided in an
uncoordinated way, makes things worse
instead of better.” _
Britain dispatched about 100 comman-

dos to Bagram airﬁeld north of Kabul two

weeks ago as the vanguard of a force esti-
mated to number at least 6,000. But those
other troops, put on alert by Prime Minister
Tony Blair for immediate duty, were told to
stand down after Central Command deter-
mined that the timing was not appropriate,
ofﬁcials said. «

That delay prompted complaints from
British Cabinet ministers about a lack of
cooperation with Washington but Blair
himself insisted that there was “complete
agreement” between the two governments.

France has also planned since mid-
November to send about 250 troops to
Mazar—e—Sharif to secure the city’s airﬁeld,
guard humanitarian convoys and prevent
rival factions from turning their guns on
each other. e

About 60 French soldiers have already
been sent to Uzbekistan, where they are
awaiting the order to move. They were to
be joined by troops from Jordan, which had
offered to establish a military ﬁeld hospital

in the city. -

To provide stability in Kabul, U.S. and
U.N. ofﬁcials had been mapping out a plan
to deploy a peacekeeping force composed
of soldiers from Muslim countries. Turkish
officials said they were anxious to the lead
and had special forces ready to arrive on
short notice. ' 1
American ofﬁcials and foreign diplomats

~ said allied governments were told by the

Bush administration to slow down.
“Gen.‘ Franks is very much in charge of
everything and he doesn’t want to worry

about a multinational force,” said a diplo-

mat representing a U.S. ally. “The United
States has one goal: attack al-Qaida and get
the job done and they’re not too wonied
about the rest of it right now.”

The Northern -Alliance, 0 a royalist
group and two exile delegations —— one
backed by Pakistan, the other by Iran —— are
now discussing the nitty—gritty of power-
sharing: how many people would form a
supreme council and a. smaller interim
administration to govern Afghanistan and
how the membership of each body would
be divided among rival groups, U.N ofﬁ-
cials and delegates said. ,

A central goal remains the establish-
ment of a a government broader than the
Northern Alliance, which now controls the
capital._

‘5All the factions see the urgency "of a
hand over (of power) in Kabul,” said U.N.
spokesman Ahmad Fawzi. “But there is no
agreement yet on any of the key questions.”

the police report says. “The weight would be
dropped to thé ﬂoor, pulling the pledge’s arm
with it.”

Sclair told The Pitt News that he never
had that conversation with police, and that
while there rnay_have been a weight with a
rope attached to it in his room, it was not his
and was not used for any activity involving
people that night. Sclair said he doesn’t keep
weights in his apartment but that a friend
might have brought it.

In an interview with ' The Pitt News,
Greg Dodell, another Alpha Epsilon Pi
member, said he arrived with the students’
IDs shortly after Sclair called, but stressed
that his involvement was limited to trans-
porting the ID cards to the apartment. A

Dodell said that the evening’s activities

— with which he wasn’t involved but was '

aware of — included a scavenger hunt for
new pledges, but in no way constituted haz-
ing. According to Dodell, the pledges’ IDs
were taken so that they would be unable to
use Port Authority Transit buses or enter
their dorms during the night. The purpose of
the night-long hunt, he said, was to foster
bonding between pledges and teach them
about the ﬁaternity’s history. ,

According to Sclair, there was no ofﬁ-
cial scavenger hunt that night. Sclair said that
the ﬁatemity does host an armual scavenger
hunt, but that whatever happened Tuesday
night was not-ofﬁcial fraternity business and
was not a scavenger hunt.

_ Dodell, who said that IDs were taken as
part of an ofﬁcial  frmction, said
that the action did, not constitute hazing in
any way, because upon entering into pledge
activities, each prospective member signs a
contract stating that they don’t have to do
anythingthey don’t want to do.

Dodell said that, to the best of his
knowledge, no ﬁghting occurred that night.
The baseball bat, he said, was present, but

, was the property of one of the residents, and

not used for ﬁghting; The weight at the end
of the rope was used for an activity in which
fraternity members quizzed pledges about
the group’s histo1y'*while they held the
weight, he said

According ‘to Dodell, he agreed to

return the IDs when Sclair called for them ’

because no one else was willing to risk

becoming involved with the police.
According to Sclair, no one was willing

to risk becoming involved with the police

because they had taken some students’ IDs.

as a prank and feared legal retaliation.

“The only reason I was involved is I
went over to clear things up,” Dodell said. '

The police report said that the Pitt police
were called because all ofthe ID cards were
Pitt IDs. When a Pitt oﬁicer anived, she told
city police that hazing of any kind is strictly
forbidden by University policy, and asked
that they complete a report to assist the
University with its oversight of student

The report also said that two glass pipes
— “of the type used for smoking marijuana”

/

-—— were found in plain sight in Sclair’s enuy
hallway, but were not entered as evidence
because they broke when oﬁicers picked
them up. ’

But, Sclair said that what the report
refers ‘to is a nargila, or hookah, that is
designed strictly for smoking tobacco, and
was purchased by his roommateﬁwhile ‘in
Israel. "Sclair told The Pitt News that the
police forceclhim to take the hookah, which
he said was never in plain sight, outside and
break it into pieces.

Kathy Schrieber, commander of the Pitt’

police, said the fraternity will be charged as
an institution. Alpha Epsilon 'Pi is‘ being

I brought before a special judicial board com-

prised only of fraternity members on hazing
charges. Schrieber said this is standard pro-
cedurc for offenses within the Greek ‘com-
munity. '

As of now, no individual members will
face charges. _

And T though individual judicial board
charges, as well as criminal charges, are pos-
sible in a case such as this, none have been
ﬁled. Schrieber said criminal charges seem
unlikely in this case.

Hazing, Schrieber said, is not much, of a
problem at Pitt, adding that the last hazing

- incident she recalls was four or ﬁve years

ago '

_ A ‘According to Dan Darling, who until a

few weeks ago served as president of Pitt’.s
Interfraternity Council, Schricber is essen-
tially correct. -

“Overall, we don’t have a big problem’ 2

with it at Pitt,” Darling said “That’s not to

say nothing happens .-. . but you could argue

that almost everything is hazing.” I
Darling said that the IFC maintains its

own deﬁnition of hazing -—— one. that is I

almost overwhelming because of the broad-
ness of its scope.

- But Darling said that he can sum,the-

oifense up as “making the pledges do it
when the brothers anen’t doing it with them.”

Darling said he didn’t know of any spc- ’

ciﬁc instances where Alpha Epsilon Pi was
involved in hazing its pledges, but recounted
his own freshman-year experiences with dif-
ferent fraternities’ pledge procedures.

“I sensed that things were different [at
Alpha Epsilon Pi],” Darling said of his
pledging days. “I’d come home at the end of
the night, and I’d be happy  but [friends
who were pledging» Alpha Epsilon Pi]
weren’t always happy.” 

Darling said that although hazing is not '

much of a problem here, there always exists
a reluctanceto change tradition within an
organization. He added that some people get
into a “if it happened to me, it should happen
to the. next guy” mentality, but that “we’re
trying to change with the times.”
‘ Sharon Malazich, Pitt’s Greek adviser,
was out of town and unavailable for com-
ment yesterday. Interim Dean of Students
Jack Daniel said that while he was unfamil-
iar with the speciﬁc incident, if given evi-
dence that a group was involved in hazing he
would see to it that the fullest disciplinary
measures were taken. ' I

Identifying the mission
of a student newspaper

Few people question the value of a free
press or its role in society. In school, we
learn that the First Amendment provides for
a free press in order to fulﬁll the complex
and vital ftmction of disseminating ir1forma—
tion to the public.

It is in such a context thatThe Pitt News
functions. The Pitt News is Pitt’s student
newspaper, designed by its constitution with
the mission “to prepare and publish a high-
quality newspaper, to provide experience for
its members in all facets of the joumalism
profession, to provide a voice for the stu-
dents of the university, and to provide a pub-
lic forum for the university community.”

In covering Rainbow Alliance’s “Sex
Toys 101,” The Pitt News consciously ful-
ﬁlled this mission. 6

Because it was a campus event spon-
sored by a student organization, the lecture
fell well within the bounds of activities typ-
ically covered by The Pitt News. By cover-
ing the lecture, The Pitt News functioned as
a public forum and reﬂected the campus
community. The event and its coverage
sparked vast amounts of discourse, reaching
beyond the University community to the
state level.

The choice tocover the lecture should
not be construed as a tacit endorsement of
the event. The choices involved in its publi-
cation and placement within the layout of
the paper reﬂect sentiments regarding the

event’s newsworthiness. It might even be
noted that some staff members found the
event and the placement of the article with-
in the paper inappropriate.

Additionally, The Pitt News routinely
covers conﬂicting sides of various issues
such as abortion and the war on terrorism,

indicating that coverage alone does not

imply endorsement.
Clearly, campus events and the issues
they present are subjects for canrpus debate.

But what should not be up for debate is the

issue of censorship. Some of the public
response to the lecture’s coverage has cen-
tered on how either The Pitt News should
have censored the article or how the
University should censor The Pitt News.
These responses negate the First
Amendment and The~PitI News’ role as the
student newspaper at Pitt. It should also be

noted that The Pitt News receives no fund— «

ing from Pitt and is thus not subject to cen-
sorship from the University.

As we strive to fulﬁll our role as an
independent student newspaper by covering
the campus events that meaningfully impact
students’ lives, The Pitt News welcomes

your input. Whether you agree or disagree,

please do not hesitate to voice your opinion
by commenting on our Web site (www.pit-
tr1ews.com), writing a letter to the editor or
personally‘ contacting our staﬁ’ with your
concerns.

Sex toy event intended to educate

RAINBOW ALLIANCE STEERING COMMITTEE
Newsmakers '

Editors note: The following is submitted by
a group of student leaders who pkzy a role in
campus events. Newsmaker columns appear
periodically in The Pitt News.

When the ofﬁcers of the Rainbow
Alliance sat» down to consider the events that
we would conduct during World AIDS
Week this year, one of the suggestions was a
presentation on the safe use of sex toys. We
thought this was important because many.

- people don’t understand the ease with which

diseasesare spread when using sex toys. The
Rainbow Alliance ﬁrmly believes that the
only way to stop the -spread of I-IIV/AIDS
and other STDs is through education. .
Unfortunately, the coverage in The Pitt
News article “Students learn sex toy safety,”
which appeared in the Nov. 29 edition, mis-
represented the focus of the workshop by
virtually ignoring the  prevention

aspects of the workshop. For instance, the.

workshop discussed the pros and cons of the
materials that sex toys are made of. There
was in—depth discussion about the dangers of
the more porous materials such as PVC rub-
bet and jelly. Toys made of these materials

can not only transmit diseases between part~ .

ners, but also can house infection-causing
bacteria. Many people are not aware that

. even when only used by one person, if not

used safely, sex toys can result in infection.-
This workshop was not a sex toy show-
and—tell. The presenters came prepared with
statistics, useful facts and instructions on
proper cleaning and care. It was this type of-

The Rainbow Alliance is a campus
organization with the purpose of
‘ fostering awareness and understand-
ing of the gay and lesbian community.

information that the presentation was meant
to convey. . _

The Rainbow Alliance stands by its
right to hold this event. We believe that there-
was a need for this event, even if it didn’t
appeal to everyone. We try to hold events
that will cater to a wide range of students on
campus. This presentation was. part of a
whole week of events educating students
about I-IIV/AIDS prevention. We do not
limit our events to the GLBT — gay, lesbian, —'
bisexual, and transgender — community.

Instead we build a bridge between the ,'

GLBT and straight communities with a‘ 

focus on education and safety. We have held

a Variety of events including National Day of .

Silence’ in support of civil rights for GLBT
individuals, the lecture from Daphne
Scholinski, a transgender speaker and 
educational panel presentations and movie _
nights.
It must be remembered that this event
was not funded by tuition money or tax dol-
lars from the state, but by private Rainbow
Alliance funds.

7 Even if this money had come from the
University, it would have come entirely ﬁom
the student activity fee. The U.S. Supreme
Court case Southworthv. Board of Regents
(2000) states that such fees must be distrib-
uted in a viewpoint-neutral, fashion by a
body democratically elected by the students.
The viewpoint neutrality principle defends
the. First Amendment rights of students,
ensuring that the University does not put the
needs of some student groups above others.
The University administration would not
have been in a position to approve or deny
ftmds for this event. ‘ - .-

The Rainbow Alliance‘ therefore sug-
gests that any comments regarding this event
be directed to us -— not to the University
administration, The Pitt News or anyone
else. ‘ ,~

An administrator questions
journalistic standards

Dear Ms. McLaughlin:

Having read almost every issue of The Pitt News
since I became Interim Head of Student Affairs, I con- ,

tinue’ to be impressed by the leadership you have pro-
vided for this publication. As I have indicated on sev-
eral occasions, I have been and will continue to be an
ardent defender of freedom of the press and speech. In
the immediate instance, I understand ﬁilly the inde-
pendence of The Pitt News to determine its content,
even though The Pitt News has a formal association
with the University of Pittsburgh.

Moreover; I believe that the defense of a free press
and free speech is of critical importance for young
people who are members of a higher education learn-
ing community. Thus, I am among those who defend
your right to place a story, “Students learn sex toy
safety” as the lead, front-page story for the November
29, 2001 Pitt News. At the same time, I want to be
among the first to question The Pitt News’ judgment
regarding the contentand placement of that story.

I respect the varying individual and collective ,

expressions of sexuality and related experiences. I am
an advocate of sex education, broadly defined. At the
same time, I believe that the diverse nature of our
campus and surrounding community is such that the
preservation of a free press, free speech, and sex edu-
cation requires persistent vigilance in the exercise of
our freedom, lest we awaken the demons of P censor-
ship. For example, I could choose to make a reference
to an “incestuous son,” as opposed to selecting the
more profane expression. My choice of terms depends
on factors such as where, when, how, why, and to
whom I am communicating. I, as well as many other
members of the University community, could not

ascertain why The Pitt News chose to publish the ‘

above-referenced story, as written (and accompanying

pictures), much less place it on the front page'forj

readership.

What was the purpose of using a picture that

numerous members of the community deem porno-
graphic? What was the purpose of using language
that also would be classified as pornographic? Given
The Pitt News’ readership beyond" our campus, what
were the desired outcomes of this story? Using your
standards of best practice in journalism, does this
story meet those standards? Perhaps your published
response to these questions might help to deter those
who would react by seeking to limit the freedom of the
press and free speech.

Jack L. Daniel
Vice Provost for Academic Affairs
Interim Wee Provost and Dean of Students

  I=o.cus: Sex toys lecture coverage

Coverage fulfilled paper’s mission to report on
issues that shape student life  

It is immensely important that Dr. Jack
Daniel recognizes and defends The Pitt
News’ rights and freedoms. It is

pornographic. Our coverage was — as it

always is — designed with a higher purpose.

The Supreme Court has ruled that

my hope that his strident beliefs
in freedom of the press and -
speech are echoed throughout the
entirety of Pitt’s administration.
Recognizing that it is the pre-
rogative of The Pitt News to'"pub-
lish whatever its student leaders
deem newsworthy, I-’m neverthe-

  

obscene and unprotected speech is
thatwhich is without “redeeming
social importance” (Miller vs.
California). What The Pitt News
published was no centerfold. It was
an informative photograph accom-
panying a story designed to explain

less glad for the opportunity to in conjunction with sex toys.
explain to our chief priority — Editorin Cmef _ Desired outcomes don’t
our readers — the reasoning change with story topic. They

behind ‘publishing yesterday’s» _
front page story, “Students learn sex toy safe-

ty.”

The Pitt News has never demurred in its _

mission to accurately report on the issues that
shape student life at this University. Whether
you agree with the ideas presented at
Wednesday night’s seminar or not, the event
generated considerable student interest.

Given-the fact that the event was of interest to

so many students, it was placed on the front
page. There were three stories that the ‘sex toy
safety story preceded, and each was consid-
ered for the front ,page,_ but ultimately" dis-
missedifor different reasons.

The Pitt News has already given sizeable
coverage to the Living Wage campaign-this
semester (often on the front page), and .the
charity rummage sale simply didn’t generate
the same student interest as the sex toy safety
seminar. Dr. Maya Angelou had been featured
on the cover of The Pitt News just theday
before. Story placementis a news judgment
that studentleaders in our office — who have
received months and in some cases years of

. training — are more than qualified to make.

The, photograph and language chosen to

— accompany the story are a fair and accurate

representation of the event. To have chosen
different language or to have cropped crucial
elements from photos would have effectively
misrepresented the entire affair. -The
University community is a ‘wide and diverse
one, and people are bound to disagree on the
basis of taste. It is appropriate to note,
though, that students — who make up the
majority of Pitt News readership — have
vastly different ideas’ about standards of taste
than their administrative counterparts at the
University.

Neither this story nor its photograph‘ is

remain, as ever, to educate and
enlighten members of our campus community
and to encourage thoughtful discourse. And.
to that end, The Pitt News succeeded yester-
day. Students and administrators alike were
talking. Students without prior knowledge of
sex toys learned about the importance of safe-
ty measures. Caution harms no one. Any story

that teaches, reports on an event that a signif-'

icant number of students attended and pro-
motes campus discussion meets my stan-
dards. I I  i

I am proud of the daily work this newspa— .

per does and I am proud of the integrity dis-
played by its employees. I l A
And to critics, I say this: Your opinion
matters too. But the most effective way to
address? your disapproval is via a signed let-

ter, e—mail or phone call to me. If you are A

blaming Pitt-News content on the University,“
you "are in efror. I, and I alone, assume full

responsibility for what appears on our pages. «- ' A I

This invitation to discourse extends to
administrators and alumni as well. I will
gladly receive phone calls and correspon-

_ dence, even if it is critical. That is my job. It
is not the job of fellow administrators, stu-
dents, colleagues or friends. Telling these

people how enraged you are will accomplish
nothing. Members of my staff and I have held
meetings on many occasions with individuals
and groups, unhappy about coverage. I will
never turn down the opportunity to discuss
ways in which we can make The Pitt News

better. This is a university, and thoughtful 

discussion should be oneofiour primary

goals-

Shannon McLaughlin expects to hear from

. you. You can reach her at 648-7985 and via e-

Jerry Garcia more than just
the Grateful Dead

Grateful Dawg
Pittsburgh Filmmakers
(412) 681 -5449

7i‘t'7i‘4'7i‘4'

DANTE A. CIAMPAGLIA
Staff Writer

“Grateful dawg music” sounds like something
that could describe the sounds of a metal band.
Maybe it’s some side project from the working
class dog, Rick Springﬁeld. Fortunately, it’s neither
of these things. “Grateful dawg” describes the
music of Jeny Garcia and David Grisman. It is the
eclectic mix of bluegrass and old-
time whaling songs and even chil-
dren’s music.

The documentary “Grateful
Dawg,” directed by Gillian Grisman,
chronicles the collaboration between Grisman and
Garcia. The ﬁlm begins with the duo’s ﬁrst meeting
at a Pennsylvania bluegrass show in the ‘60s to the
formation of their ﬁrst band, Old and In the Way.
The rest of the ﬁlm is devoted to their 1989 reunion
and the subsequent ﬁve-year life of their second
band, The Garcia/Grisman Band. _

The ﬁlm is very effective in showing the love
and respect Grisman and Garcia shared. There are
many scenes of Garcia looking to Grisman for

 ..4...'.*.'.....'.;---1..s....'.“..'..“.'..;;.

Watch

advice on a song and vice versa. The ﬁlm is cut to
entire songs, resulting in sections that resemble a
concert ﬁlm and not a documentary. But the footage

“accentuates the obvious bond between the two

musicians. - ' p ._
This is especially true when the ﬁlm focuses on
the epic 17-minute song “Arabia.” It shows the pair
at their best, depending on one another for cues for
the next movement or change. If Garcia . and
Grisman were not comfortable ‘with and respectful
of one another, the sheer length of the piece would
have destroyed the song. Instead, it comes off per-

_ fectlyand is an excellent piece of work. .
Any documentary with Jerry Garcia as a focus

could easily lose sight of itself and focus on his
career with the Grateful Dead and how_ it strained
the relationship with Grisman and the band in clas-

sic “Behind the Music” exploitative style-.~This‘

never comes close to happening. ‘There are virtual-
ly no Dead references outside of early
interviews with former Dead members
and the occasional reference to Garcia
being the “king of the Deadheads.”

_ The documentary is about two
musicians and their band that, in Grisman’s words,
“had a career without having a real life.” It focuses
on Grisman and Garcia, but never centers on one or
the other. There is great reverence paid to Garcia,
but it never becomes too much.

Grateful dawg music couldn’t exist without
Grisman’s and Garcia’s total comfort with one
another and in their friendship. It is this friendship,
and the music created out of it, that takes center
stage.» '

I used to be proud of not crying
at movies. '

But then, one afternoon while
watching a video of “Little
Women” with the female members
of my family, one by" one, we -
began to cry when Beth died. I
looked around the room, and

mother had been talking on the
phone and had to hang up because '
she was crying.‘ My sisters, my
aunt, my mom and I were crying. _
I couldn’t believe it -— I had never cried at a movie,
and “Little Women” is the girliest movie in the world.
But I still can’t watch that one scene. , V
Recently, I’ve been . doubting my ’ emotions.
Sometimes I feel like I can learn about the most violent,

emotionally. I wondered: what had happened to the pain , _
‘ sensors in my brain; if they ‘had gone into hibernation or

if my tear ducts had dried up. In the Bible, there’s a verse
about people who have given themselves over to sin and
it says they are “beyond feeling,” and I wonderedabout
my own state of being. .
- And then I had an experience that reconfirmed my
lost feelings. '_
Two weeks ago, I saw a movie with my friends. I
went into the theater not really knowing what it was‘
about. I hadn’t seen the trailer, and knew only the direc-

tors and the actors. The film began and I was immersed in"
the story of a man who lives in quiet desperation. People ~

‘come in and out of the quiet life of the protagonist, a'bar-’

ber who never does anything different. He’s not happy,‘

he’s not unhappy'— he’s emotionless.‘ "

A- Beethoven sonata weaves itself in and out of the
beautiful black and white film, and" sometimes I just
absorbed the stark images on the screen.

When the end became apparent, I thought I could
handle it: in fact, I partially expected it. But I couldn’t
take it. The final scene mirrors an earlier scene, and the
poignancy of the film overwhelmed me. A wave of sad-
-ness overtook me, and I struggled to keep my eyes dry.

Sitting in the darkened theater as glimpses of light p
played across our own white faces, I tried to swallow..my ‘

sobs while furtively glancing around to see if anyone else
as emotionally affected as myself. .
They weren’t, or at least, not like I was. I don’t even

remember the last time I cried like that. When I started to *-

laugh at myself.for crying like this — and at a movie,
where, no one is real — I sounded like I washysterical. _I
thought maybe the laughing would help subside the sob-
bing - I .  

But I couldn’t stop. Even afterl went into the bright,

cool bathroom tolwipe the mascara off of my wet face, ‘ ‘ 

and even after I sat down to rest in a pink stal1,_the sobs
,wouldn’t stop welling up inside. They came and they
came and they came. ‘

I cried and I cried and I cried.

And, finally, I felt better.

Going undercover as a Cultural Trust usher at the Byham Theater

LESLIE HOFFMAN
A&E editor

I arrive under the glittering lights and
shining brass of the Byham Theater approx-
imately ﬁve minutes late for my blind date.

Sam Bass, a tall but stooping older
man with neatly trimmed silver sideburns
and a beard greets me at the entrance. I
apologize for being late, but he only nods.

Afterall,IsetupmydatewithBassto
experience being an usher, and now this
head usher has only a half—hour to train me.
We step quickly up the entrance ramp into
the main lobby where a few ushers have
gathered, and then down the wide staircase
into the lower lobby.

As we rush, Bass says of my training,
“This is not even 101. This is a half.”

Pittsburgh’s Cultural
Trust utilizes a volunteer
usher program to generate .
ushers for the Benedum
and Byham theaters. In
exchange for ushering, vol-
unteers get to see shows for
free. Currently, more than 500 .
people volunteer to usher for the .
two theaters.

This night, it wasn’t
that difﬁcult because the
theater was only one-third
full for the Japanese adap-
tation of “Oedipus Rex,”
but I could see how it could
be more difficult if the
production was something
like “Les Miserables.”

Bass shows me where
to hang my coat, and shows me
a box of colored usher cards; every
time someone ushers, he receives a
stamp on the card. He pulls out one
card that must have at least 75
stamps. A

We hurry back up the stairs
and into the main lobby. Bass
tells me the primary rule of ush-
ering —— we have to have a smile
on our face.

I’m a little stressed, but I
smile a little harder when he tells
me this.

Bass gives me a quick tour of
the main ﬂoor of the Byham
Theater: The orchestra section is
the ﬁrst ﬂoor, the gallery and the
mezzanine sections are upstairs. I
don’t have to worry about any-

this evening. Here, the seat num-
bering is simple: odd numbers ,
in their 20s are on the left (left
from the back of the theater),
even numbers are on the right
and the center runs from seats

  
  
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
  
  
 
  
  
   
 
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
  
 
 
  

101 to 119.

When Bass tells me how to seat '

patrons — the code for theatergoers — he
emphasizes that their comfort is always
what matters. Hence, the necessary smile.
Bass tells me to ﬁrst ask, ‘May I assist
you?” and never, ‘May I help you?” He
says the word “help” demeans patrons.
Once ushers take the patrons’ tickets, they
check to make sure they’re in the proper
location; they may need to be redirected to
mezzanine or gallery seating, or they may
need to enter the theater from the opposite

' tions must now compete with
_ loud Japanese chanting. I strain
' to listen to him.
Bass also tells me that if
I’m offered a tip, I should take
it; it would be offensive to the
-patron to refuse it.
“A tip in the the-
ater, we don’t frown on
it,” he said. “It shows"
you’ve done your job.”

has ushered for the
Benedum and the
Byham theaters

patrons. But he says, “Just think who’s the
front line of defense. You! Tonight!” and he
points a bony ﬁnger at me. -~ ~

We return to the lobby to meet with the
other ushers who are stuﬁing ﬂyers into
programs for the night’s production.

Bass introduces me to the throng of
ushers, who all resemble grandparents.
Bass has told me their average age is prob-
ably 50 years old, but I’m still surprised
when I see them.

The ushers split into two groups, an
upstairs group and a downstairs group, and
I am left to receive instructions from Kathy
Terleski, my ﬂoor manager for the evening.

Terleski instructs me to stand near the
far left entrance of the theater — this is my
domain for the night The

Around 7:30 p.m., people I
begin to mill about the theater.

woman with towering black

’ ' When I reach the top of the aisle, I see

two of my roommates. We laugh when we
see each other, and I ask them formally,
“How may I assist you?” .

When they show me their tickets, I tell’

them to go around to the other side of the
theater; technically it’s my job to seat them,
but if I seat them on the left side of the the-
ater, they will have to walk over eight other
people to get to their seats.

I usher about six or seven more sets of
patrons, and everything goes smoothly. But
no one presses a bill into my palm.

Back in the lobby, the lights dim and
the bell sounds, and last minute patrons
rush in. I don’t seat anyone now —-— the
other ushers take them. Shortly after 8 p.m.,

we close the doors, and at

the request of the compa- _

ny, do not permit anyone
to enter for about ﬁve
minutes. I only see about
three or four late arrivals.

_ Some of them have dressed nicely, but not

ostentatiously. Some use the opportunity to
don long, glamorous dresses and heels. For
themost part, patrons’ appearances reﬂect a
casualness about the Byham. Despite its
gilded columns and cherubs, the theater
does not inspire the same awe as the expan-
sive Benedum and its crystal chandeliers.

Terleski receives word from the com-
pany at about 7:45 p.m. to open the doors.
Once the heavy doors open, people gravi-
tate toward them. Six ushers, including
myself, stand at the entrance, waiting to
escort patrons to their seats. _

My ﬁrst patrons approach me. I know
them and they laugh when they, see me in
my white button shirt and bow tie, and I tell
them what I’m’ doing. Seating patterns in
the Byham are not at all difﬁcult to under-
stand, but of coursetthe ﬁrst people I seat
have received their tickets free from Pitt,
andthey aren’t next to each other.

I hesitate, and about three ushers ﬂock
around me. I explain the problem, and one
of the other ushers explains to the couple
that they’ll have to sit in separate seats until
the show starts and there are empty seats.

I look at them, embarrassed because

they’re my friends, and   ‘:Sorry.”, ‘ __ _

disappear, until it’s just me and another
woman. Everyone wants to watch the
show. A »
When I finally enter the auditorium, I
quietly usher myself to an end seat in the
last row. Darkness covers us, and the only
light in the theater comes from the brilliant
stage. I can see other ushers, ghostly ﬁgures

. with white shirts and in most cases white A '

hair, seated throughout the back of the audi-
torium. .

The show is beautiful: The characters
move slowly and dramatically over the
spare but striking stage. I follow the story
by reading the screens set up at the sides of
the auditorium, and look around at people’s
peaceﬁrl faces in the dark.

At the end, as people scattered
throughout the theater rise to applaud, I rise
and stand next to Terleski at the back of the
theater. At this point, I still think I will have
to do something. _

But no, when the house lights come up,
the ushers merely take their places at the
entrance and say goodnight to patrons. Ten
minutes later, when Terleski tells us we can
leave, I’m shocked. My blind date has
come to an end. -

EVAN CASE
Staff Writer ‘
For ﬁve_ weekends in December,
Pittsburgh Filmmakers and the Regent
Square Theater will give fans of classic
comedy — and, indeed, classic cinema
— an incredible treat. Charlie Chaplin,
perhaps the most beloved and respect-
ed ﬁlm artist of the 20th century, will
return to the big screen.

Five of the Chaplin’s first six fea-
ture ﬁlms -will be shown during the
including
“Modem Times” (1936), “The Gold
Rush” (1925), “The Great Dictator”
(1940), “The Kid” (1921) and
Chaplin’s all-time masterpiece, “City
Lights” (1931). The American Film
Institute named three of these to its list
of the 100 greatest movies ever made.
It is hard for me to disagree.

‘ .; x. 7- ‘

Chaplin’s character is instantly
recognizable. Always an outsider, the
mustachioed Little Tramp, wearing a
ragged, baggy suit and a bowler, his
cane twirling endlessly as he shufﬂes
-off, feet pointing in different direc-
tions, is one of the great images in ﬁlm.

Chaplin developed the character in
a series of classic short ﬁlms from the
teens. He parlayed recognition into
wealth and wealth into independence.

film, the tramp “adopts” and raises a
baby he ﬁnds abandoned in an alley.

" The ﬁlm effortlessly blends the

slapstick of the tramp’s unconventional
fatherhood with the pathos of their
forcible separation at the hands_ of the
child welfare . department.
Interestingly, Jackie Coogan played the
kid and he would later become Uncle
Fester on “The Addams Family” TV
series.

“The Gold Rush”
Chaplin’s best. Set during the Alaskan
gold fever of the 1890s, the ﬁlm fea-
tures some dark humor in addition to
traditional moments of slapstick
knockabout. . » .

the Little Tramp spends a harrowing
few days with another prospector. A
lack of food forces them to eat their
boots. With that dish gone, the other
man begins to-imagine Chaplin as a
giant chicken, and, much to the tramp’s
dismay, acts accordingly.

“City Lights,” one'of-the greatest
ﬁlms ever made, came four years into
the sound era, but Chaplin decided to
release it silent for artistic purposes. L

But there are sound effects include
ing L the kazoos used - to represent "a
politician’s speaking voice. The story,
detailing Chaplin’s hilarious attempts
to raise money to cure a blind ﬂower
girl with whom he’s in love (she has

 

\

mistaken him for a millionaire), is
practically perfect.

“City Lights” has the highest laugh
content of any Chaplin feature, with a
poignant ' conclusion that has been
called “the highest moment in movies.”

“Modern Times’? is an amazing
take on the industrial growth and dehu-
manization of the 1930s. While work-
ing on an elaborate assembly line,*‘the
Little Tramp loses his mind and wreaks
delightful havoc on his factory. The
rest of the film follows Chaplin’s
attempts to reconnect with a society
that has become too high-tech- and
depersonalized for its own good.

Finally,. in 1940, Chaplin moved
into the sound age with the Oscar—nom—

inated “The Great Dictator.” A gen— _

uinely searing indictment of Hitler and
Mussolini, the film features Chaplin in
the dual role of a Jewish ghetto barber

film remains hysterically funny

Chaplin’s ﬁlms cross all bound»

who has actually seen the above ﬁlms

Week 11 in the NFL ended with a
24-17 upset by the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers over Kurt Warner and the
St. Louis Rams on Monday night.

The game was a thriller as each
team had the lead at various points in
the game, but two fourth—quarter inter-

ceptions by Warner sealed the victory

for the Buccaneers.

Over the past few seasons, when the
Rams and other teams around the
league have lost to the Buccaneers, they
have not gone on to win the Super
Bowl.

The Rams are now at a record of 8-
2, which puts them in a tie with the San
Francisco 49ers in the NFC West.

The Rams have to pick themselves
up after this loss —- they cannot allow
history to determine their fate and con-
cede the division to the 49ers. The 49ers
are not even close to the caliber of the
Rams. They are a team that has been
able to keep winning, but they certainly
don’t belong at the top of the division.

In fact, there are several teams
around the NFL that are in first place in
their divisions and do.not belong there.
The only exception would be the Jets
and Dolphins, who are battling for first
place in the AFC East and the Raiders in
the AFC West.

I am standing by my pick for Green
Bay to win the NFC Central. Despite its
poor performance against Detroit on
Thanksgiving and Atlanta the Sunday
before, they will overcome the Bears.

I’m just waiting for the Bears to fall
apart. The Bears escaped with a win

Pitt had just lost 45-7 to Boston College, dropping its
fifth straight game. Fast forward to the present. - .

Pitt faces the University of Alabama-Birmingha
Saturday and with a win, will have completely come

back from the depths of a’-lost season, to which they 

seemed to have been headed toward. ’

The Panthers, at 5-5, have a bowl berth waiting for
them, most likely in the Tangerine Bowl, if they win on
Saturday. ’ '

A Pitt victory would complete a surprising resur-
gencefor the Panthers, which saw the team rise from dis-
appointment to its present record with wins over Temple,
Virginia Tech, Rutgers and West Virginia.

“To [the team’s] credit, I think we kept our eye on the
bull’s-eye, focused on each team and did the things you
have to do in order to win the game that we played,” Pitt
head coach Walt Harris said. “Now they know it’s a one-
game season and there’s ‘going to be a reward for the
winner.”_ A . _

The Blazers, at 6-4, are already bowl eligible, but are
fighting with aslmany five other Conference USA teams

dubbed the “Steel Shield” by head coach Watson
Brown. ‘

They are led by defensive end Bryan Thomas,
who with 13 sacks this season has become U-AB’s
career leader in that category, defensive tackle
Eddie Freeman, nose guard Rodney Jones and
Marlon Bush. . V ‘

Beyond the front line UAB is still solid as

linebacker Rod Taylor leads the Blazers with 101 -

tackles, three sacks and two interceptions. UAB

has intercepted at least one pass in eight of its 10‘

games this year. .

“They have speed, athletes, and good corners,”

Harris said. “Their secondary plays extremely
well, they don’t give up the big plays.”

Pitt has a defense to match, though. Since
averaging 31.5 points allowed over the first six
games, the Panthers" defense has gone on to aver-
age less than eight points a game, while slashing
their yards allowed per game from 370 to 160.

Senior defensive end Bryan Knight leads Pitt
with 15 tackles for losses and Ramon Walker has
115 tackles. UAB coach Watson Brown summed
up the Pitt defense saying they’ve been “dominat-
ing through this four-game stretch.”

“I think that we have to push the idea that we
need to have a low—scoring game,” Brown said
when asked about his mentality going into
Saturday, ’ ‘ ' p ‘ g _.

But neither offense is without weapons.

Freshman Raymond Kirkley and the Panthers’

offense will have their work cut out for them as they
will face the nation’s top run defense this Weekend.

his career, and freshman tailback Kendal Gibson

short-yardage back. UAB also has Thomas Cox, a
junior QB who filled in when senior Jeff Aaron
went down at midseason.

Cox led the Blazers during their winning
streak and supplanted Aaron as the starter through
his performance. He rushed and passed for over’
100 yards and scored two touchdowns in UAB’s
last game, a 43-21 win over Houston.

, Pitt’s Antonio Bryant, coming off his 11-
reception, 186-yard performance, should be draw-
ing double-teams most of the afternoon. Along
with R.J. ‘English, he is part of one of the Big
East’s most successful receiving tandems.

Senior David Priestley will throw to Bryant
and English. Priestley has been sharp lately, mov-
ing up to sixth on the Panthers’ all-time passing
yardage list, and has the extra motivation of
extending his playing career to the next level.

Priestley, English and Knight are three of the
15 seniors who will be playing their final home
games’ for Pitt Saturday. The other seniors are
offensive lineman Mike Bosnic, tight end Brennan
Carroll, linebackers Nick Cole, Brandon Williams,
Amir _Purifoy and Ryan Gonsales, defensive line-
man Joe Conl_in, running backs Darcey Levy and
Joe Vaglia, cornerback Mark Ponko and place-
kicker Nick Lotz. =

“We’re playing at home, 15 seniors graduate,
we have a chance to look at our season possibly in
a different light and feel good about our accom-
plishments,” Harris said. “But what really matters
to me is the way we fought ourway back. To me
that’s the most precious, the thing that means the
most to me.”

recorded four consecutive tri_ple-dou- 7‘

'bles in games against Connecticut,

Boston College, Youngstown" State
and West Virginia. .

“They played well together all
year and it was great to see them be
awarded for it,” head coach Chris
Beerman said.

The duo had a final hurrah last
weekend in the Long Beach State
Thanksgiving Tournament to end
their season. The.Panthers lost in a 3-
0 sweep to the No. 1-ranked Long
Beach State 49ers on Friday, but later
defeated Weber State 3-0 on Sunday.

Long Beach State 3, Pitt 0

Despite a crowd of 2,026 fans at
the Pyramid in Long Beach and the
top-ranked, undefeated°49ers on the
other side of the court,_ Pitt» played
with confidence. — '

“People came up to me after the
match and said, ‘This was the best
team we have seen play here in a few
weeks,”’ Beerman asserted. 1

For the 24th time this season, the
Hatlestad and Norris combo posted

team-high numbers in the match.
Hatlestad led the Panthers with 21
kills, six blocks and two block
assists, whil‘e Norris recorded 33
assists, five digs and two blocks.
Freshman Gini Ullery added 11 kills,
four digs and served one ace.

The Panthers had their best per-
formance in" game one of the match.
Despite Pitt’s 19 kills on 40 attempts
to the 49ers 18 kills on 33 attempts,
the Panthers 1ost‘30-26. «
As the match continued Pitt’s accura-
cy diminished and it was defeated 30-
22 in the second match. And the
women’s overall worst performance
was in game three, recording only 9

kills on 32 attempts and committing 8‘ 7

errors to Long Beach State’s 18 kills
on 35 attempts. ,

“We played awesome against the
No. 1 team,” Beerman said. “We

played about as well as you can play '

and I am proud.” « -

Beerman has reason to boast
about his team’s performance
because out of the 84 games» Long
Beach State competed in this season,
only 51 games did they allow their
opponents to score over 20-points.
And the Panthers scored 20 or more

Hatlestad‘ recorded another 21
kills, Norris had 49 assists, Ullery
posted her sixth career double-double
and Junior Dionne Hayden added 11

-digs to bounce the Panthers back

from their previous loss, to defeat the
Weber State Wildcats in a sweep.

“Our ball control through solid
passing and tough serving helped us
in the match,” Beerman said.

Pitt notched a match-high .19 kills
on 38 attempts to beat the Wildcats in
game one 30-22. Weber State com-
mitted eight errors, to the Panthers
six: as they lost 30-26 in game two.
Both teams-had a .275 hitting per-
centage in game three, but the
Panthers held on to close out their
season with a 30-23 victory.

“We handled the. match well
against an athletic and physical
Weber team,” Beerman said. “They
had to grow up a lot through this sea-
son and these matches create great
momentum coming into next season.”

The Panthers finished fifth in the
Big East with a 7-5 conference
record. The team was 11-16 overall.

have sent the game into overtime.

Look for Green Bay to beat the
Bears again. If Tampa Bay can’ get over
its inability to win when it’s below 40
degrees, things" could get interesting
when the Buccaneers visit Chicago. If
the Bears cannot pull out these games
then that might jeopardize their playoff
chances, but it’s still a long shot for
them not to make it. .

My pick for the declining NFC East
is the Washington Redskinsl
Washington is on a roll and appears to
be on its way to the top, with a victory

over the Philadelphia Eagles last
Sunday. The Eagles play at Washington
for the teams’ final meeting.

As long as the Jets beat the Steelers
on Dec. 9 they should win their division,
which will set up the AFC Central divi-
sion battle between Pittsburgh and
Baltimore. ‘

If the Steelers lose to the Jets and
the Ravens beat the Colts, the Steelers
legitimately could lose the division.
This would set up Pittsburgh at 9-3 and
Baltimore at 8-4, going into their Dec.
16 matchup. -

Baltimore has a bigger challenge in
order to" win the division as defensive
end Michael McCrary is out for the sea-
son and running back Jason Brookins is
also likely out for the remainder of the
season. i

Elvis Grbac should‘ have regained
his confidence after leading the Ravens
to victory in the closing minute and a
half of the fourth quarter last Sunday.
Grbac hooked up with tight end
Sharmon Sharpe, who was Very vocal
the week before about Grbac’s four-
interception performance against the
Browns, which set up Cleveland’s win-
ning score, , ’

The Ravens’ defense still likes to
end things dramatically and this is even-
tually going to kill them if they don’t get
it together. Every week, the defense
dominates the entire game then waits

until the end up the game to give up .a V

crucial score.
It would help if the offense sus-

tained drives to keep them off the ﬁeld, 
but they have to start playing better in

crucial situations. The Ravens need to
go back to their style last year, where if

a team did get in the red zone, they only I

gave up a ﬁeld goal. V .
'  The team has already given up 33
more points in ll games this season
than all l6‘games of last'seaso"n.

With allcof; the disadvantages, it will

, be. difficult for" the Ravens but I am _

goingto stickwith them to pull out the
division unless the Jets lose to the
Steelers. , _ _ ._
Oakland is the obvious choice for
the best team in the AFC West. Seattle

beat the Raiders a few weeks back, but '

the Seahawks and Denver Broncos will

not catch the Raiders. ..-‘
When it is all said and done I exp ‘ct

for the NFC playoffs picture to consist

"V of St. ‘Louis, Green Bay, San Francisco,

Chicago, Washington and Philadelphia.

The AFC playoffs should consist of ,

Oakland, the New York Jets, Baltimore,
Pittsburgh, Miami and Denver.

S Afteranother week of football my V

predictions may change but as of now,

_ my picks seem to be reasonably accu-

rate.
