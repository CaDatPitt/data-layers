The new head of the Black
Studies department will be named
within two weeks, according to
Faculty of Arts and Sciences Dean
Jerome Rosenberg, who will make

the ﬁnal decision.
“I want to emphasize we have -two
good candidates,” said Rosenberg.
“Pin pleased to have two very

qualified candidates instead of not —

having any good ones. And I don’t
want people thinking that the one
candidate not chosen was under-
qualified.”

Candidates have been narrowed.

Depression or not?

‘ .

BY BOB EVANS

Varied reactions to the state and
future of the nation's economy
emerged this week following the
inflation cures proposed Tuesday
by President Ford.

Pitt Economics Professor Reuben
Slesinger indicated an unhappiness
with Ford’s speech, saying, “Pres-
ident Ford’s speech really didn’t
hit on the main points which
require attention. ‘

“What Ford has done will not stop
inﬂation, it will just redistribute the
money already in circulation."

Slesinger said the policies out-
lined by Ford will not curb
inflation, calling Ford's recom-
mendations “aspirin-type cures."

“More should definitely have
been done to increase the
aggregate effective supply, rather

than playing with monetary and -

ﬁscal type policies. These are
.merely, aspirin-type’. cures, with

. jobs when unemployment exceeds

  

in the black studies department, he
said.

According to Rosenberg, he
received the ﬁnal report from the
full Search Committee on Septem-
ber 23. Three sub-committees of
the-committee made oral reports to
him, by September 25.

Rosenberg was in the process of

making his decision when one of
the leading candidates, Dr. Con-
stance Achononu of Washington
State University withdrew her
application for chairmanship.
, “This was unexpected,” Rosen-
berg said. “The Search Committee
checked with viable candidates in
August and Achononu was still
available. The Search Committee
believed and I believed that she
was still a viable candidate.

“Achononu’s resignation caused
a change in" circumstances. I met
with the faculty when they had
their revote and one very useful
thing came out of it, a resolution of
unity. The faculty voted that they
would fully support whichever of
the two candidates was selected. It
is significant that faculty members
have agreed in advance to swallow
their disappointment and support
whoever is named chairman.

“The department has worked well
in the past,, like when they
developed the department mission.
I’m sure that when the department

. head is named we’ll have faculty

members rallying behind him.
“lt’s unfortunate,” Rosenberg

Regarding the 5% surcharge,
Slesinger said, “Those who will get
cuts from this new policy will get
their money back, and then this
money will be spent faster. This
will not help ﬁght inflation."

Slesinger approved of Ford's
proposed 10% investment tax
credit. which is designed to
encourage expansion of businesses
and factories.

“This is a very good idea, because
it will induce industry to become
more efficient.

‘‘It will generate a new flow of
cash, because presently there
exists a cash bind.

“Also this credit should beneﬁt
the country's fiscal income,
because for every $1 billion in the
gross national product, the govern-
ment gets approximately 25%."

Slesinger explained the Com-
munity Investment‘ ‘Corps, de-
signed to provide public service

    

 

said, “that partisans of one side
have grabbed the headlines while
partisans of the other side are
letting the investigation run its
course. The media has presented
the situation like a basketball game
with both candidates racking up

points in their favor. One gets the '

idea that this is competition with
one bad guy and one good guy. But
we have both candidates well
qualified.

“I’ll have the decision in another
week or two,”
took the Search Committee nine
months to complete its work so I’m
entitled to all the time necessary to
evaluate the pros and cons‘ and
strengths and weaknesses of the
two candidates.”

said Rosenberg. “It .

“This step is a depression

This action is one of those things

Admitting that although problem

are not of a depression type.

“Yes, we have problems, but not

BY LlSA RUBENSTEIN

The president of Pittsburgh A-
merican Civil Liberties Union
(AUCL) Wednesday night blasted
President Ford's action concerning
amnesty and the pardoning of
Richard Nixon.

“Mr. Ford’s amnesty plan is not
amnesty at all, but clemency,”
said ACLU President Charles
robb. He explained that amnesty
clearly means forgiveness while
clemency is an abstract term that
can have several meanings. “E-
very day it seems to mean some-
thing different,” he continued.

Robb speaking at a Pitt Young
Republicans meeting in Schenley

’ Hall. said the United States go-

vernment is not in the position “to
be able to judge people’s motiva-
tions about fighting the war." In
some instances the amnesty plan
will require this type of judgment
on specific cases where draft

evaders or deserters did not get CO

(concientious objector) status.
“The program seems to have
been hatched by Ford without a
great deal of forethought," com-
mented Robb on the discrepancies
within the program. He explained
that in the end the courts would
play a key role in working out th
details. V

The Advising Center reports the
following information for CAS stu-
dents registering for the winter
term 1974-75. Registration for
seniors begins on October 28: for
juniors on November 4. The
registration period for freshmen
and sophomores is November 8-
Dcccniber 6. Juniors and seniors

ments for an appointment. Ap-

group sessions to be held the week
oi" October 7-11. i 11 is lMPERA-
TIVE for‘ students to attend their
own advisor’s group session to be
in the lottery.

“The ACLU takes the position
that we can’t just object to the plan,
we have to help people to get the
maximum advantage from the
plan, by giving legal counsel to
those interested in amnesty.” He
explained the poororesponse from
draft evaders and deserters by the

inconsistencies and confusion con-‘

cerning how the plan will work.

“Most people are hanging ‘back’

trying to see what will happen.”
Robb explained the ACLU was

disappointed by Ford’s pardon of

former president Nixon.

President have the right to pardon
someone who has been charged
with impeachment?"

in discussing impeachment, Robb
said the House Judiciary Commit-
tee used most of the impeachment
articles concerning obstruction of
justice and violation of civil libert-
ies that the ACLU had charged
against the President. Robb felt

the secret bombing of Cambodia”

should have been listed in the
articles of impeachment. “It was
clearly an unconstitutional usurp-
tion of power by the President."

Robb said the ACLU is very
concerned about Ford’s decision
regarding the Nixon tapes. “This
unilateral decision by President
Ford about the tapes is improper."
The tapes were turned over to
Nixon with the provision that they
can be destroyed in five years or on
the event of the former President’s
death. Robb explained that in
order for the deomcratie process to
work completely the American
people “must know everything that
went on.”

Whether you’re still in medical school with the
rigors of three to ﬁve years ofgraduate medical edu-
cation still to be faced, or are already a practicing
physician, it’s our opinion that the Air Force can
offer both professional and personal satisfaction
hard to duplicate in civilian life.

An overstatement? Not ifyou consider the
specifics.

Take the problem of graduate medical educa-
tion. it's a period of your life the Air Force can make
considerably easier with comfortable salary and liv-
ing conditions. ’

Creature comforts aside, the Air Force offers
professional advantages. Besides receiving training
in your own specialty, you’d be in Contact with
physicians in all of the medical specialties. You’ll
function in an environment which is intellectually
stimulating and professionally challenging.

Not all physicians pursue post residency fellow-
ships. But if you are interested, the Air Force con-
ducts them both in-house and atcivilian institutions.

The physician already in practice can look for-
ward to other things. If you want training in the
practice of the medicine of the future, you’ll ﬁnd it
in the Air Force. For example, there’s emphasis on
group medicine and preventive medicine, and the

- growing specialty of “family physician.” Whatever

your interest, there are few specialties which are not

being practiced in todayfs Air Force. . ‘
The physician starting his practice in civilian

life has to take into accountthe cost of setting up an

the Air Force does not. He ﬁnds his ofﬁce established
for him. Supplies and equipment readily available.
He has many options available to him when treating

patients. For example, he can consult with Air Force '

specialists. He also has referral to other Air Force
facilities via aeromcdical evacuation. Last, but not
least, are the satisfactions that come with having
the opportunity for regular follow-ups, and a missed
appointment rate that is practically nil.

Whether you are already a physicianfor soon to
become one, you might ﬁnd it extremely interesting
to ﬁnd out what the Air Force has to offer. We think
it could be a real eye-opener. Ifyou’ ll mail in the cou-
pon, we’d be happy to send you detailed information.

 weeks ago an editorial in the Pitt News raised several
2 _e_stifo'ris related to the faculty’s efforts to unionize at Pitt for collective
 purposes, and in which it was clearly stated that the issues

However, it should be noted that the University processes already in

 aculty can also appeal their tenure cases to the Senate Committee on
‘ eriure and Academic Freedom, which can protect the faculty from

proper and unsubstantiated tenure rejections.

“overning Authorities

important issue involved in the unionization question concerns the
:ent- to which faculty should participate in the governing process of
‘.3’-..I'-Iniversity.

ridoubtedly, administrators should not have sole and unchecked
,j__icrity in making decisions concerning the day to day operations of
je; University, including tenure decisions and the appointment of
epartment chairmen. However, faculty already participate in tenure

 as the recent crisis in the Black Studies Department
iridicates.

we. must state, though, it is the responsibility of University
adrninistrators, and not the faculty to make the ultimate decisions on
Iliiiyersity operations. Faculty should not have veto authority over_
 decisions. .

As_~_in any institution, however, faculty and students should have
substantial input into the decision making processes at "Pitt. An

:'faculty and students is not properly administering to his job, cannot be
fsted ‘ with the important decisions affecting the University’s

perations, and should be discharged. ‘

Most importantly,ithough, faculty, students, and administrators must

 the motivation for any decision at Pitt should be simply: what is,
 best interests of Pitt students.

Afterall, it is the students who give the University its primary and
 mission as a learning institution. Though many in the Pitt

.community may debate the mission of the University, it cannot be

 enied the primary function of any institution of higher learning is

 ythat--leaming. And that is the goal of every student enrolled in

  A Price Tag

 

 that faculty should be guaranteed all rights of due process I

on Pitt Faculty Unionization

equating that with being in the best interests of the University.

In itself, this is a dangerous and precarious situation, since the daily
operations of the University would be dependent on what the faculty
consider to be responsible behavior. The faculty would  obliged to
deﬁne the tenets of responsible behavior. The faculty would be in a

position to drastically alter’ the structure of the University even to they

point of forcing a cessation of University operations by calling a strike
in which more than 15,000 students would suﬁer an interruption of
their education.

Or as mentioned before, the effects could be more subtle and take the
form of’ tuition increases or a cutback in faculty responsibilities.

Pitt faculty members as professionals have no need to unionize for
collective bargaining purposes, even though, that is their right
according to law. Professionals associate theimelves with ideals, not
production and take pride in their work.. Professional ideals should be
more important than the beneﬁts or drawbacks of the occupation. It is
impossible to levy a price tag on professionalism, and this is exactly
what faculty unionization essentially attempts to accomplish. '

As teachers, faculty should be dedicated to the expansion of the sum
of human, knowledge. Their goals should be more educational in

nature, than material. Professionalism and unionization by their _very_

nature are not complementary. _

Historically, unions were formed to «protect the laborer’s basic human
rights, which were being violated by ruthless and competitive
corporations in the wake of industrial expansion and burgeoning
technology. ,

This condition still characterizes many corporations today. V

However, the University of Pittsburgh is not a corporation, and Pitt
faculty are not -tyrannized laborers or civil servants, but rather
seasoned professionals.

The faculty are not in danger of losing their basic human rights. The
Pitt faculty have safe and amiableworking conditions. Faculty earn a
substantial amount of money for their services.
importantly, the University setting is not a center of petty tyranny
ruled by rhonopolists.

As professionals, though, the faculty are_ guaranteed rmny privileges
a laborer will never obtain or consider seeking. This includes the
awarding of academic tenure, which gives a faculty membe
permanent job security. _ it

Additionally, faculty already have the beneﬁt" of mechanisms
designed to protect them from improper actions on the part of
University administrators, and available forums to air their grievances.

These mechanisms and forums are the University Senate, the Senate
Council, and the Senate'Committees.

Faculty unionization at Pitt for collective  purposes could
permanently and irrevokably open the doors of the University, not to
cooperation among students, faculty, and administrators, but rather to
union, strife, demands, and strike threats. Such things or even the
slight possibility that they might someday occur indicate faculty
unionization for collective  purposes is not in the best
interests of the University, especially Pitt students. And, therefore, we
cannot support the faculty’s union‘ efforts.

Letter to’
the Editor

We, faculty members of the
Department of Black Studies, are
aware of the responsibilities of the
officers of the Black Action Society
as the representatives of all black
students on campus. We have
supported and will continue to
support their active involvement in
the affairs of Black Studies, so that
jointly we can build a relavant black
institution at the University of
Pittsburgh. For all of us this is a
grave responsibility that can be
discharged faithfully and success-
fully only if we are willing to
examine critically all sides of the
issues and problems that affect
Black Studies at this University.

In this spirit we would like to call
your attention to the views
expressed in recent issues of Pitt
News and the BAS Newsletter.
The information reported in these
two instances is incorrect and this
has created a misrepresentation,
intended. It is

Black Action Society to ascertain
the accuracy of the information put
before black students and the
university community, and at all
costs, to avoid creating ‘further
divisiveness within the Department
of ‘Black Studies. One of the
unfortunate by-products of the
information already released is to
add to the acrimony

department.

We urge you as officers of the
Black Action Society and as
individual black students to make a
serious effort to speak to a cross

_ section of the 16 full-time faculty

members in the Department of
Black Studies. In addition, we will
make available in the near future a
more comprehensive statement on

f ‘the crisis in Black Studies." Should

BAS wish to explore these issues
further, we will be more than glad
to meet with you so as to seek bette
solutions to the problems confront-
ing us. Of one thing you can be
sure: we are all committed to the
development of a strong, viable
and community-relevant Depart-
ment of Black Studies of which all
of us can be proud.

We remain,
Yours in the Struggle,

Life at Intercultural House H0

A BY MARY LINTZ
How often, do you see an equal

number of black and white people

eating dinner together in Cafeteria
Cafeteria C? How about a
night without roast beef or an
afternoon with three orange ele-
phants tap-dancing in the Quad?
Contrary to popular belief, there’s
a place where this actually does
happen every night (not the ele-
phants) near our ‘own campus, yet.
It's the Intercultural House in a
house on North Dithridge Street.
‘squeezed among the Fraternity
Houses. The name—lntercultur-
al—lnight lead you to believe that
there are people living there fronl a
great number of foreign countries.
“But it is intercultural, not inter-
national," the residents of the
house will remind you, and it's a
place where 24 college students,
mostly graduate students, and a
director, live ‘together and try to
understand and communicate each
other’s backgrounds. 1
“Each person has his or her own
culture,” said Joe Abate, a gra-
duate student at the House. “By
interacting with each other, we

\

.9

realize the disagreements that
occur, but also we get to know one
another and try to understand why
these difficulties should exist.”

Besides the obvious ways of
interacting with the other people in
the house, like eating together and
sharing housekeeping and cleaning
responsibilities, they hold group
discussions.

“Our' main ethnic cultures are
blacks and whites, men and wo-
men," Abate says.

Therese Chisterson, another gra-
duate student added, “We have
some really serious talks about the
difficulties we have in getting along
with each other.” Through these
discu'ssions, they become more

aware of what makes other people ‘

feel the way they do, while learning
to break the barriers between men
and women and blacks and whites.

But for some of the residents,
what attracted them to the house
was the $440 housing and meal fee
a term, a far,cry froln the $700 a
term paid by dorm residents on a
full meal plan.

For Abate, there was no room left
in the dorms by the time he was

accepted by the University. He
was informed of the IC house.
applied, and is now glad he was
accepted because of the people he
has gotten to know.

Others are disappointed that there
are not people from foreign coun-
tries living there. However, a few
of them have backgrounds from
other countries and occasionally
prepare their own specialty meals.

The Intercultural House director,
Walt Grady lived in the house two
years ago, then decided to try the
job of director when he saw the
want—ad for it. _ ~

“The House has little affiliation
with the University of Pittsburgh,
except that the people living here
are students at Pitt," Grady says.

“We receive some funding from
the Gertrude Stein foundation, but
most of the expenses are paid by
the residents.”

The House receives some funds
under the Intercultural Project,
founded’ in 1969. But all of this is

unimportant. say the members of

the house, for their main concern is
with each other, , attempting to

somehow see that all people are

really the same.

‘Students at the Intercultural House get together for dinner and conversation.

even a lot of men who can’t do it.”
According to Klapp’s experience

in the past two years, the band
members generally treated her.

fairly although all the girls were
subject to harrassment. I “There
were a few die-hards who just
didn’t want to see us around.”
Two of those die-hards quit solely
because women were being admit-
ted!

Clarinet.-player Amy Saul was the
only girl in her section at that time,‘
whereas the other three girls
marched together since they all
played cornet.

“Criticism is used in the band to
get you to do your‘best, butit went
too far," Saul said. -“There were
people who were very set in their
tradition and didn’t want women in
their"section. After a while it.
amounted to humiliation."

Saul marched for two games and
then dropped out. She returned
again this year because, “At every
football game I felt bad I wasn’t
down there. I know I wouldn’t be
happy if I didn’t try again. Now
there are a lot more women—22 out
of a total of 107 members—and
they get a lot of encouragement
from each other.”

"Saul has observed a definite
change in the band's attitude.
“Women are more accepted now
that everyone had to try it and it
worked." They are so accepted, in
fact. that when a visiting band"
comes to Pitt the girls are “allow-
ed" to make the cookies. “I always
wondered who made the cookies
before there were _ girls in the
band." she said wryly.

The loss of a large number of
traditionalists through graduation
and the considerable influx of
freshmen and women each year has
done much to raise the band’s
tolerance toward females. There

were also quite a few open-minded '
members two years ago, who often‘ "
'refused to admit. They would tell.

Saul, “Stick it out, but don’t tell
anyone I told you to!”

Trumpet player Lowell Good, who
has been with the band before and
after the change, still can’t get
used to the idea or the actuality of
women members. He claims it
“changed the whole morale” when
girls were allowed to join.

“I’m-against the idea in gener-

*-al," he said. “There's a lot of ego ‘

involved and girls aren't as ego“-I
building conscious. It used to, be
rougher and tougher and we work-
ed harder.” y
Obricki and Popsack, and the

band‘s two remaining female pio-
neers attest ,to the fact that
absolutely no concessions were, or
are, made to female members, and
that the band’s musical standards
are as high as ever.

1 Good still" retains his adamant
anti-female stand. “Guys are more
capable to withstand physical hard-

ship and therefore it affects the I‘

whole morale,” he said grimly.
True. the sousaphone players are

all men, but it is often difficult
even for them- to handle that
enormous instrument, but one
trombone player, one baritone
player, and two of the drummers in
the band are women.

Drum Major George Slota feels
that regarding women in the band
his position has to be one of
impartiality. “If they can do it,

they should be allowed." Slota was '

assistant director the last year that
the band was all male. as well as
the following year when the first
five girls joined.

“They really surprised me,” he
admitted. _“I didn’t think they
could do ‘as well as they’ve done.”
A woman possibly marching as
drum major someday, though,

“would take some getting used.

The final powerful notes rever-

after the echo dies away a brief

“Let’s go!” Four short bursts of

takes up a spirited march.

Hower has told the band repeat-
edly that if someone can pick them

something wrong. Even viewing
the band from every possible angle
it is impossible to tell the girls from

Eong-haired boys as well as girls

And he bellowed in earthy chants:

But if you run away from me—,
I’m gonna catch ya,
Even if I can’t hardly see.
Everyone in the Student "Union

Sonny when he had finished. \,“You

are hopeful that an annual festival
of contemporary music involving

immodest hope.“ says Wayne
Slawson, chairman of Pitt’s De-
partment oflMusic, “is that a
workshop devoted to the rehearsal
and performance of contemporary
music by a chamber orchestra will
help stimulate new compositions
for chamber orchestras; that it will
introduce student performers to
contemporary music; and that it
will tend to open chamber or-“
chestras themselves to a more
varied repertory. We think -the
Colloquium will provide a focus for
the attempt to communicate the

Spy Story by Len Deighton;
1974; Harcourt, Brace &
' jovanovich; $6.95"

James Bond islan Fleming's spy
hero. John Le Carre tinkers with
his spymaster. George Smiley. And

3' ‘ILen Deighton has his English spy,

Harry Palmer, who is back again
after a ﬁve year absence in Spy
Story.

Sometime during his absence,

 - Palmer has undergone a metamor-

phosis. He now has a new name,
Pat Armstrong, a new employer,
the War Game Studies Center in
London and a new job as personal
assistant to its new director,
Colonel Charles Schlegel, a tough
ex-marine.

But even this new identity doesn't

L — stop Palmer’s, or shall I say,

Armstrong’s old boss, Dawlish,

 from recruiting him for another spy

mission.
This time the problem is a ‘high

Remoziva's sister is the
chairperson for upcoming reuniﬁ-
cation talks betwen the two
Germanys. Remoziva's defection
would sabotage these crucial talks.

Dawlish and the British Secret
Service want nothing more than for
the reunification talks to fail. A
united Germany would upset the
status quo in the political arena.
Germany’s agricultural east would

make French agriculture suffer/for‘

the Common Market, in addition to
making a gain for the French
Communist Party. A united Ger-
many would also be a more
powerful rival to the faltering
British economy. '

Realistically, these arguments are
all very valid and will cause serious
problems for Western
under a unified Germany. Unfor-
tunately, the basic tenet, that of
East and West Germany holding
reuniﬁcation talks, is absurd since
both Germany's have already
established diplomatic relations. ‘

As a result, . Deighton's novel
comes off as “fairy tale espionage”
instead of as a realistic spy novel
with a credible plot like Le Carre’s
brilliant book, Tinker, Tailor,
Soldier, Spy.

maybe the Pitt soccer team will do
the same to the Slippery Rock

Like Liston and the “Big Red

impressive statistics and are

the Reds were stunned after
Baltimore had beaten them four out

said. “But they will be aggressive,
have a lot of pursuit, and execute
beautifully. The Edinboro coach
saw them play, and he said they are
the best Slippery Rock team he’s
ever seen.”

Back from last year’s Rocket
squad is Kama] Houria, who scored
the winning goal against the

Panthers last year.

“Whenever he gets the ball, you
know something is going to
happen,” Bemis remarked.

However,~Bemis is also satisfied
with the Panthers steadily improv-

played their best game of the year,
but lost.

“Halfback Tom Murphy played

_'real well against Temple, and Andy

The 67th meeting between the
Pitt and West Virginia University
will take place tomorrow afternoon
at Pitt Stadium, and it should be an
interesting renewal of the rivalry
which began in 1895. Both teans
will enter the game with 2-2
records, but past performances will
mean nothing once the game gets

underway. Both teams will be
searching for a win to give them a
big boost into the second half of
their respective seasons.

West Virginia will attach the
Panthers with a well-balanced
offense that finally came into its
own against Indiana. Perhaps a
decisive move on the part
of Coach Bobby Bowden, starting
senior Chuch Fiorante at quarter-
back, was the big reason for their
success against the Hoosiers.

EDITOR’S NOTE: This is another
in a weekly series of scouting
reportswritten for the Associated
Press by Penn State Coach Joe
Patemo. This week Patemo takes a
look at Wake Forest, the Nittany
Ijions’ opponent this weekend.

STATE COLLEGE. PA. AP--
Wake Forest is a difficult opponent
for us to assess‘ because of the
difficult schedule they have played
up to this point and the factthey
are playing a lot of young people.

We are expecting a good, tough,
close football game.

Their offense is young, but they
have some promising players.
They only have two seniors on their
first offensive unit. ‘ '

The quarterback is a freshman,
Mike Micke Mcglamry. He has a
good arm and a quick release and
throws the ball well on the sprint
out. He has completed 25 of his 59
passes for 343 yards and one
touchdown.

They have been running the
Houston ‘veer offense with a lot of
option plays. McClamry runs the
offense well and has a couple of
good runners to make it work.
Frank Harsh, a 212 pound fullback.
gives them good running inside
and Clark Gaines- is an outside
threat.

Defensively, they have been hav-
ing their problems;_ but they have
played some of the best offensive
teams in the. country in North

. Carolina State, North Carolina and

Oklahoma.

We are banged up physically and
we expect a tough game this week. a

coaches. and a chance to act as Ben
Williams and Chuck Fiorante. the
West Virginia quarterbacks, in
practice this week.

“We’re gonna be ready this week
for West Virginia,” Haygood said.
“This is our first game against
Eastern competition and we need it
to point for the Lambert Trophy.”

Haygood is quick to praise the five
players who form the wedge, a
phalanx which bowls over anything
in their way. i .

“Sometimes we'll stay after prac-

everything straight," the ﬂeet 180
pounder said. mentioning Allen
Webster. Bob Hutton, Todd Toer-
per. Curtis Smith and Jim Corbett _
as the keys to his return‘ success.
Last week was just an indication of
what Haygood can do when turned
loose. but it hopefully won't occur
as often against the Mountaineers.
It'd be nice just to see him return a
kickoff to open the game, and have
the defense. after having 1,000
yards netted against them get

Haygood won’t get a good, long
restafter football is ended. He
immediately takes off his cleats and
laces up his Converse All-Stars.
He is expected to see some action
on Buzz Ridl’s squad, as a back-up
guard.

“Pitt was one of the few places I
wanted to go which would let me
play both football and basketball."

You have to wonder if the man
ever gets tired.

Esposito, the greatest goal scorer
the NHL has ever seen, pumped in
o8 last season and linemates Ken
Hodge. 50-55. and Wayne Cash-
man, 30-59. complete the highest
scoring trio in the league.

Bobby Schmautz, 33-32, was ob-
tained from the Vancouver Canucks
in midseason last year and_ has
added anouther 30 goal man to
Cherry’s list. Captain John “The
Chief” Bucyk, the league’s best
left wing on the power play, tallied
31 times with 44 assists.

and their mother said Boston’s'
hopes would ride on the potential of
goalie Gilles Gilbert. Obtained
from Minnesota where he was
tucked away under Ceasar_Man-
iago and Gump Worsley, Gilbert
was never given the opportunity to
prove himself. He was a flopper
when the North Stars obtained him
but has since metamorphized into
an excellent stand-up goaler. His
performance in the playoffs showed
his capabilities under pressure.
With a year of experience under his
belt, he should rival Bernie Parent,
Tony Esposito and Ken Dryden for
the Vezina Trophy.

Philadelphia Flyers, they should

ln Toronto, Red Kelly may be in
trouble. Luckily, the Buffalo
Sabrea are in deeper trouble. Kelly
scrapped his three goaler system
and is concentrating on Doug
Favell. an all-time choke, and Dune

have shown some potential but only
when they weren't inadequately

S 3. Friday,

to show. Darryl Sittler, a 38 goal
scorer last year, could be the new
leader, if the Toronto management
can keep him content.

Ron Ellis, 23-25, is steady, but
Kelly must be counting on the
revitalization of Cowboy Bill Flett,
obtained from Philadelphia. Flett
could manage but 17 goals last
season after 43 the previous sea-
son. Flyer's coach Fred Shero is no
dummy. Flett‘s 43 goals were a
fluke.

On defense, last year's Swedish
rookie imports Ian Turnbull and_
Borje Salming are bright spots for
Kelly's future as isganother Swede,
left wing Inge Hammarstron. Jim
Glennie and‘ Brian McKenny are
the bets on the blue line giving
Kclly his strongest part of the
squad.

The Buffalo Sabres earned a-
playoff berth three years ago in
their first year in the league but
goaltending problems have set
them back in a few years, at least.
With Dave Dryden’s defection to
the WHA and Roger Crozier’s
repetitious pancreatitis, the Sabres
are forced to go with Gary Bromley,
Rocky Farr and Jacques Caron.
Bromley and Farr were stalwarts
for .the Cincinnati Swords of the
AHL while Caron was the backup
netminder for the Vancouver Ca-
