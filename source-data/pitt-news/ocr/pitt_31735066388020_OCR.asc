New genetics institute to open

By Jim Tezak
News Editor

Dr. John Mulvihill and Dr.
Joseph Glorioso will be named
co-directors of the new Pittsburgh
Genetics Institute later this month.

The institute will be a joint
venture of the University of
Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon and
several area hospitals. According
to Glorioso, the main purpose of
the institute will be to foster
clinical and educational programs
in genetics.

“It’s our hope that Pittsburgh
will become one of the major
centers for genetic research,” said
Glorioso, professor and
chairperson of molecular genetics
and biochemistry.

“It would be a voluntary
federation of people interested
in genetics,” said Mulvihill,
professor and chairperson of
human genetics. Research and
the clinical, legal and ethical
aspects of gene therapy will be
explored, according to Mulvihill.

“The Pittsburgh Genetics

Institute would be a vehicle to tie
these researchers together for their
mutual benefit and to attract
outside sources of funding,” he
said.

Glorioso said that the institute
will be broken down into three
main categories: gene mapping
and sequencing of genes
contributing to inherited diseases,
research programs leading to
human gene therapy and AIDS
research. ‘

Gene mapping could include

Bush plan to cut work study, grants

families with incomes less than $ 10,000. ” If enacted,
this would eliminate 400,000 students nationally
from being eligible for Pell Grants.

The number of students eligible for Pell Grants
will sharply decline, and the size of college work-
study programs will decrease if Congress accepts
President Bush’s new budget recommendations.

These changes are part of Bush’s proposed Title
4: Student Aid_Provisions of the Higher Education
Act.

Bush recommended $29.6 billion for Pell Grants,
an increase of $2.5 billion from 1991.

Bush proposes to raise the current Pell Grant
eligibility from $2,400 to $3,700 for fiscal year 1992.
He said he want to fund this by lowering student
eligibility.

The budget proposal said, “We want to promote
effective targeting of the majority of the funds to

Louis Tronzo, assistant to the president and
director of federal and local governmental relations,

said this means little to him because he doesn’t “A

think Bush’s Pell Grant proposal ‘ can be
implemented.

“It's not going to go because students who are
eligible for the maximum Pell Grant now aren’t
getting it because there isn't enough money in the
program to get it,” Tronzo said. He said it would
take another $3 billionto fund the Pell program at
current levels.

“As of this date, we havenot been able to identify ’
any congressmen who support the proposal,” said
Tronzo. The Education Labor Committee has already

Peace groups plan teach-in onwar

By Eric Hoch
Staff Writer

In an effort to educate students
about the war, the Faculty and
Students for Peace will hold a
teach-in Wednesday on the
Middle East crisis, according to
academic counselor David
Hughes and student Jill Castek.

“The most amazing thing about
this whole conﬂict, ” said Hughes,
“is the lack of background
information —-— like the history
and the religion of the area —-
given to the American public by
our media. Our objective is that
the more people know about the
history and culture of the area,
the more difficult it will be for the
Bush administration to justify this

Castek said that although Pitt
President Wesley Posvar said he
would not allow a moratorium
on classes because of the war, he
asked the faculty to make
allowances for students who miss
class to attend the teach~in.

Castek said teachers should
allow students to make up
assigments missed during the
teach-in.

The teach-in will consist of
speakers on campus and
workshops in the Cathedral of
Learning.

Starting the teach-in will be
professors Richard Cottam and
John Beverly, who will speak on
the background of the war. The
talk will be held in the Moot
Courtroom in the law school.
Castek said a panel discussion

will be held at 7 p.m. in the David
Lawrence Hall Auditorium. The
panel will consist of Molly Rush
and David Hock, both from the
Thomas Merton Center, and Pitt

studentsAaronYoung andMelissa .

Moran.

“‘Also at the David Lawrence
Auditorium will be Christopher
Hitchens, a columnist for The
Nation,” said_ Castek. “He will be
discussing why we are in the
Middle East.”

According to Hughes, several
different workshops will be held
in the Cathedral of Learning. The
workshops will be held at 2:15
and 3:45 p.m.

At both times the following .

workshops will be held:

Policies set forth by the Inter-Fraternity Council
have curbed drinking at fraternity parties,
encouraged more responsible behavior among the
Greeks and reduced liability.

“Basically, the Greek system could be eliminated
at Pitt if we aren't careful. We wanted to take action
before the university kicks us out," Darin McMullen,
IFC president said.

Fraternities and sororities are “subject to this
policy, including all official activities sponsored by
the fraternities or sororities, on or off campus
anywhere, whether in official chapter houses, in
private domiciles or in publicly or privately owned

most underage drinking

facilities,” according to the policy.

This policy also allows individual houses to make
their own decisions about whether or not to have
alcohol at any or all social events, with the exception
of rush events where alcohol is prohibited.

“Fraternities are always under fire because parties
mean alcohol, and everything comes under ﬁre.
We're making efforts to improve before the university"
says, ‘You have to go,” McMullen said.

No open parties are allowed by the IFC. Any non-
Greek attending a party must be on a guest list,
which must be finalized two hours before the party
begins.

Each brothermay only have four invited guests
at any party. A total of 10 guests not on the list may

If -you grew“ up in "a family
where at least one of your parents‘

. was an alcoholic you probably

experienced a household that was

unpredictable and ‘ perhaps‘
violent. . .  '
Many students are happy to

escape from I this ch'aol;i'c"
atmosphere when they.lea.’ve.—for“~

college, but’ “true escape,
unfortunately,“is not that easy.“
Adult..childre~n of alcoholics
(ACOAs) often have _internalized
many of the problems of their
childhood.‘ They -~may, for
example, continue having trouble
expressing theirfeelings, trusting

9 others, believing they have their

own rights or talkingiabout
personal things, since keeping
secrets is so strongly enforced in
the alcoholic family. These be-
haviors, can make it difficult to
establish intimate relationships.
When ACOAs do get involved
with someone, they often are

attracted to people in need of
“rescuing” — alcoholics, for
example, or people with other
personal problems. Children of
alcoholics have often taken on a
great deal of misplaced
responsibility while growing up,
and they frequently carry over
this caretaking role to their adult

lives, often at great expenseto
themselves.‘ Since ‘dysfunctional .
relationships -have» become ~~so—
familiar to th7em,*they also seem
to have». an unusual . -amount of .
tolerance for staying in personal
relationships that are unhealthy.
ACOAS are .-also overly »self- _
critical,~have trouble relaxing and
tend to be loyal beyond reason to
people who do notdeserve that
kind of loyalty. When they are
highly successful, and many are,
they frequently do not enjoy their
success, often reporting that they
feel empty inside. Adult children
of alcoholics are also at high risk
themselves for becoming addicted
to alcohol or other chemicals.
Not all ACOAS, of course, are
handicapped by their early
experiences. Those who are can
help themselves by breaking
through the creed of silence and
denial they learned at home.
ACOAS need to develop some
understanding of their family

experiences and how those

experiences may have shaped-

their“ personal emotional lives.
They need to learn how to better
express their feelings, share their

experiences and trust signiﬁcant

others. This can be done with the
help of a pro-fessional counselor
or through constructive sharing
with other people who have
grown up in or are presently
living in alcoholic homes.
ACOA groups, which are open
in many communities to adult
children of alcoholics provide an
opportunity for this kind of guided
sharing and learning. Al-Anon
groups also provide this kind of

opportunity for family members .

who are currently living with an

held every Tuesday from 8 to

Prof says most Pitt students respond to challenge

By Beth Kovaly
For The Pitt News

Louis Pingel came to Pitt in
.1967 with degrees in math and
research methodology. This is
his third year as chairperson of
the psychology in education
department.

He is quick to point out the
little extras that come with his
position.

“First of all, a three-window
office. And lots of books," said
Pingel, looking out at Forbes
Quad.

He does take his job seriously,
however. *

“What are my responsibilities?
In the department we have several
programs with _ program
coordinators responsible for
them. Those people meet with
me regularly. We talk about the ..
general departmental affairs,
things that need done to keep it
all going on a day-to-day basis.
That pretty much falls to me.”

Pingel also meets with the dean
of the School of Education and a
cabinet every week to discuss
any problems in the school or
any tasks that need to be
accomplished. ‘

“I don’t know that what I do is
any different than what most

chairpersons do -— whether it be
here in the School of Education
or in [the College of] Arts and
Sciences. Most of the schools are
organized fairly similarly. You
have the dean, some associate
deans and then some
departmental chairpersons.”
Before he was chairperson,
Pingel worked as a lecturer,
assistant professor and associate
professor at Pitt. He has an un-
dergraduate degree in math-
ematics and a master’s and doc-
torate in research methodology.
0 “At the University of Wisconsin
[research methodology] was
offered in the department of
psychology, so that’s what my
degree officially reads,
‘educational psychologist.’ But I’m
not a psychologist,” he said.
Pingel teaches graduate courses
in research methodology or more
specifically, statistics courses.
“The favorite of all students,”
he said with a smile. A
The psychology in education
department was at one time part
of the psychology department in
the College of Arts and Sciences.
In 1967, when Pingel came to
Pitt, the department had already
become a separate program,
educational psychology, and had
been expanded by six people,

doubling the number of full-time
faculty members involved.

“We came from all over North
America,” said Pingel. “We
brought our own ideas, and a lot
of us proposed new courses, and
those were offered. ' About five

years ago, the School of Education:

was reorganized. Combined into
one department were educational
psychology, rehabilitation
counseling, counselor education
and educational-research
methodology. They became
‘psychology in education.’

Besides teaching, Pingel does
research as well.

“I get involved in the
methodological end of research
projects that other people are
working on,” he said. “Right now,
I’m working on a project ready to
analyze the data on physical disc-
ipline of infants. I know that
doesn’t sound like statistics, but
there’s some in there, I can assure
you.”

In 1986, Pingel was awarded
the Chancellor’s Distinguished
Teaching Award. Nominated by
a colleague, Pingel was required
to put together a statement of his
teaching philosophy and the
materials used for his courses.
This was reviewed by another
faculty member, and the ﬁnal

selection was made by the Office
of Faculty Development.

“It was a fairly lengthy process, ”
he said, patting a large black
folder he pulled from a very full
bookshelf. “But it was worth it.”

Pingel said there have been
several recent advances in the
field of methodology.

“I guess the hottest topic around
these days is the different ways of
assessing educational achieve-
ment of children. I expect that
people will hear a lot about that
in the next few years. There are
people from around the U.S. and
different institutions that are inter-

ested in that same topic,” he said. 8

“Assessing kids in class and

{Scholastic Aptitude Test] testing

is certainly a part of it, but there
are other ways you can assess
whether the objectives of the

teacher are being met for the

child. There are a number of peo-
ple looking at alternative ways.”
5 Pingel said college aptitude tests

such as the SAT are always

discussed.
“There has always been a
controversy over those kinds of

' tests [SATs]. I think if you talk to

the people who construct and
administer those tests, they'll
usually tell you that you ought
not to just use those test scores by

themselves to make decisions.
Generally, that’s how admissions
decisions are made -- when
they're made responsibly. People
look at something other than just
SAT scores.”

When observing the students
at Pitt, Pingel has found them
mostly to be achievers but does
notice one problem.

“Pitt students will generally
respond to a challenge. You set
expectations for them, and they’ll
meet them. From the perspective
of ‘a faculty member, though -
and I was a student at one time
too — one of the things. I’m
always fascinated by is why
students like to cut classes.

“I’ve always looked at it from
the point of view that somebody’s
paying money to go to class.
You're purchasing a product, and
when class doesn’t meet, or if a
class begins late or ends early
consistently, you’re not getting
your money’s worth. A lot of
students don’t seem to care,” he
said.

“You’d like as a teacher, to
reach every student, but some-
times there are some who don’t

respond to you as an instructor; 5

You recognize it, and it doesn’t
make you happy, but you can’t
do much about it,” Pingel said.

stances, after the two-hour
deadline has passed.

Bartenders at parties are not
permitted to drink and must be
over 21 years old. Anyone
attending the party must be over
21 to consume alcohol.

This policy has drastically
curbed, but not eliminated, un-
derage drinking, said McMullen.

“Sometimes people over 21
are going to give underage
students a drink. There’s not
much you can do. You’re never

going to get 100 percent,”
McMullen said. “The hardest thing
is ‘having a party and being a
police force.”

The IFC is encouraging this
policy through education. “You
have to reinforce people and let
them know why we do this. The
policy used to be ridiculous.
We're trying to educate people. I
do think we’re making steps on
our own. It’s not the easiest thing
to do, but I’m hoping it will keep
getting better,” McMullen said.

“In two years this [policy] will
be the given, and there will be a

better understanding of it. It really
isn’t a hoax. We’ve taken tre-
mendous steps. The administra-
tion is very pleased with how we
have handled this,” McMullen
said.

The policies are also enforced
through the social-monitoring
committee. The committee is
made up of members of
fraternities who make random
checks at parties to ensure the
policies are being obeyed. This
committee answers to the IFC
judicial board, a subsidiary of the
IFC executive board.

\.

“When violations come about,
we’ll decide what actions to take.
We want to go with member
education and community servictf.
not social probation because it
makes people bitter towards the
system,” McMullen said.

\“We went from complete
mayhem with no rules to a very
restrictive policy,” McMullen said.
“People aren’t going to be
receptive overnight. They have
all these rules thrust upon them,
and they’re not used to it.”

Many fraternities are holding
mixers with sororities in the

D...‘

Panhellenic Association instead
of parties because of the controll.
ed atmosphere at an all-Greek
function.

“Everyone’s aware of the
policies now. Some sororities
have policies where they cannot
mix if there is alcohol,” Sandra.
Kramer, Panhellenic Association
president, said.

“We have to work with the’ ‘

national policies of each house,
Within Panhel we want to have
an education seminar so‘we are
all aware and so we can help the’
IFC enforce this,” Kramer said.

begun to receive phone calls

against Bush’s proposal.

The administration proposed a
reduction in funds from $594.7
million to $396.6 million, a
decrease of $198.1 million in the
work- study program. . ,

Tronzo said it could affect the
size of the college work- study
program by reducing the number
of students eligible for the
program or retaining the same
number of students, but allocating

less money to them.

“All of these things, if
implemented, will in my view
adversely affect some of our

‘students. I can assure you that
the university will be opposed to
these kinds of things," said
Tronzo.

These recommendations are
based on the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act. This law
governs spendingand determines
how to allocate money to reduce
the deficit over a five-year period.

Sou

 

There is no new money allocated,
so for real increases in programs
money has to be taken out of
other programs.

Another budget recommend-
ation was an $840 million increase
for the Guaranteed Student Loan
program. The increase will not
be given to students. _

“All of those funds are
associated with restructuring,
reorganizing and re—admini-
strating student-loan credit-reform
programs,” said Tronzo.

The administration proposed
restructuring GSL programs in a
way that would put the burden of
loan guarantees outside the
banking industries. It wants a
direct program between the
federal government and the
schools.

Bush proposed a new $170
million Presidential Achievement
Scholarship program for high-
achieving Pell Grant recipients.
However, this is just an idea and
has no legislative authority. The

program has not been created
yet. -.

The administration recom-
mends raising GSL limits from
$2,625 to $3,500 for first- and
second-year students, from $4,000
to $6,000 for all other
undergraduate students and from

$6,000 to $10,000 for graduate '

students.

The federal government pays
only the interest guarantees on
GSLs, and the students must repay
the money.

justiﬁcation for the university's
new policy regarding the denial

of public access to campus crime-

reports. Justification without
explanation, however, does not
expose the validity of one’s
position. Only when Mr. Yeager
explains the rationale for
implementing the new policy will
its merits become apparent.

V Mr. Yeager has said, “The new
policy is designed to iprotect the
confidentiality of Pitt faculty, staff,
students and others.”

Nevertheless, stating what the I

policy is designed to do is not

confidentiality is an individual

warrant the specific policy (which,
in effect, eliminates theuniversity

access to the reports).[...]
Perhaps the relevant
information is not what the
university can do or “what we

are expected to do under existing '

law,” but why the university
should adopt this new policy. For

~:» Lady Panthers take third in Big East Champions/oips  

By Sharon Kerestes
Staff Writer

The Lady Panthers finished a close third
to Georgetown, while Villanova once again
reigned as champions at the Big East
Indoor Track and Field Championships,
held at Syracuse University in the Carrier
Dome. The Lady Panthers were responsible
for three of six Big East records set this
weekend.

Villanova won its second consecutive
title with 129 points, followed by
Georgetown’s 88, and Pitt’s 80. Syracuse

' was fourth (63); St. John's was fifth (62),

and Connecticut ﬁnished sixth (56).

Allison Williams broke her own record
in the 55—meter hurdles with a time of 7.80
seconds. She is the Big East champion for
the second consecutive year in that event
and made the NCAA provisional-qualifying
standards.

Keisha Demas also broke her own Big
East record in the 400m. She ran 54.39 to
win the fourth title of her career in that
event and was also named one of the
meet’s Most Outstanding Performers. In
addition, she qualified by provisional
standards for the NCAA Championships to
begin March 7 in Indianapolis.

Both Demas and Williams were also
part of the record-setting 4 x 400m relay
team along with Clarissa Dudley and Ronise
Crumpler. They ran 3:47.38 to become the
third 4 x 400m relay team to win a Big East
title for Pitt in four years. Demas has run
on each of those teams and totals seven
Big East flrst—place finishes in four years.
She also placed fourth in the 200m dash
(24.67) and made the NCAA provisional
qualifying time.

Crumpler also made the provisional
qualifying time in the 200m, placing third
with 24.65, and added a third place in the

400m and a fifth place in the 55m dash.

Other place-finishers for Pitt were
Dudley, second (5Sm hurdles), fourth
(high jump) and sixth (triple jump); Kim
Blair, third (pentathalon); Jennifer Mueller,
fourth (pentathalon); Cathy Chrissos, fourth
(1000m run); Joanne Warner, ﬁfth (shot
put); and the distance medley-relay team
of Judy Facey, Danine Mitchell, Laura
O'Donnell, and Chrissos, which placed
fourth.

The Lady Panthers were unable to
challenge Villanova, which has won the
Big East team title eight out of the last nine
years. Pitt won the title in 1989 and
became the only team other than Villanova
to ever win a conference indoor
championship.

The battle for second place, however,
was not decided until the very last event:
the 4 x 400rn relay. In order to ﬁnish
second in team standings, Pitt needed to

win the event and also needed Georgetown
to score no ‘points at all. The Lady Panthers
did their job, but Georgetown came up
with a second-place finish and ended up
eight points ahead of Pitt.

Was Lewis disappointed with the team’s
overall ﬁnish?

“Heck, no!” he said. “I couldn't ask for

anything more."

He said Villanova has been the national
champion in cross-country for the last two
years, which means its distance program
is very strong. Meanwhile, Pitt’s distance
and middle—distance teams are just
beginning to develop. He also said that

Despite recession, Majorlndoor Lacrosse League

By Ethan Lott
Staﬁ’ Writer

Midway through its ﬁfth season,

 the Major Indoor Lacrosse League

is looking forward to more
expansion and proﬁtability in its
future, now that the league has
put its toughest times behind.
“The fifth year is always an
important one in a new business,”
Mary Havel, MILL vice president
of league operations, said. “Last
year we enjoyed our first
proﬁtable season, and despite
the troubles all businesses have
had due to the recession, the
success has carried over into this
year.” I 
Halfway through this year’
campaign, the league has covered

1- all of its outstanding debts from

its first three seasons.
“Everything is going up ticket-
wise, and it seems the tide may

1 be turning in the economy,”'Chri‘s_
;Fritz, league co-owner and

3 president,“ said. "‘Next_season we
,hope to add "anywhere from one '
i,to six teams.” ‘ I 1'  

In orderto keepythe leagu

cost-effective, Fritz, co-owner’
Russ Cline and the other league '

executives kept salaries and other

overhead down, which allowed

League , {attendance supports
Fritz’s claim; it has increased

Paul Diamond/The Pitt News

Indoor lacrosse is gaining support quickly, as the six MILL teams have drawn a cumulative average of 11,000 fans this season.

Philadelphia, ‘New Jersey and
Washington. The New Jersey
franchise moved to New York;
Washington and Baltimore
merged, and teams were added

in Detroit and , New England in
1989: The “Pittsburgh Bulls joined‘

the league last season to round
out the six—team league.

Havel said the Pittsburgh
franchise has lived up to all
possible expectations. “It’s only
Pittsburgh’s second season, but
they have very loyal fans who

In its inaugural season
Pittsburgh was third in the MILL
in attendance, with an average of
10,859 per game. Only the two-
time defending champion
Philadelphia Wings (15,759) and
the Detroit Turbos (1 1,932) drew
more fans than the Bulls.

Havel said the MILL chose "not
to add any, new teams this year
because it" opted for internal
expansion instead by expanding
the schedule by two games per
team.

“Their credibility issecond to

eyes of people who liked outdoor

Fritz said the league’s ultimate
goal would be to grow to 24
teams with strong community
ownership.

“We want to ﬁnd community-
minded people [to -own
franchises], and we are making a
commitment to the league staff.
This included hiring Rick Nichols
as the League’s v.p. general
manager.” ‘

Nichols spent many years with
the Houston Oilers. Fritz said he
brings expertise which the league
will need as it continues to grow.

On the possibility of expansion,
Fritz said that they will make the
final decisions after _the season
ends

“Besides the West Coast, we’re
looking at Chicago, Montreal,
Buffalo, Cleveland and
Minneapolis. The San Francisco/
Sanjose area and the North Paciﬁc
region, \where box [outdoor]

’ lacrosse is very popular, are also

possibilities.”
Fritz added that aside from

,weather problems, which hurt

walk-up attendance, this season
is all he had hoped for, both on
and off the ﬁeld. '

V-ball club Wins - two

By John Labriola
Stajf Writer

The Pitt men’s volleyball club fought off fatigue to add two
more wins to its record in a weekend sweep.

The Panthers managed to take the wind out of the Golden
Tornadoes of Geneva College 3-2 (11-15, 15-5, 15-6, 8-15, 15-
13) at Trees Hall on Saturday after quenching the ﬁres of the
Vulcans of California University of Pennsylvania in California,

Pa., on Friday 3-2 (15-8, 15-9, 12-15, 7-15, 15-4), bringing their _

record to 3-1.

The Panthers went into Saturday's game feeling that the
Tornadoes would not be a very formidable opponent, but the
Tornadoes came out strong in the first game of the match.
“From the beginning of the day, we expected to just blow them
out of the water,” said junior middle hitter Val Pennington.

The Panthers came back to win the next two games, only to
have the Tornadoes come back in the fourth game to beat the
Panthers 15-8. According to Pennington, the Panthers went ﬂat
during the fourth game, and the Tornadoes took advantage of
this.

At the onset of the ﬁnal game of the day, the spectators that
were at the match seemed to become irritated that the match
was_ taking two and a half hours. They wanted to play
basketball, not watch volleyball.

“Personally I was very fatigued. The thing that they were
doing throughout the whole match is that they were wearing
us down with defensive blocking,” said sophomore outside
hitter Gregg Haerr. “Our hitters were just getting shot down,»
but not all of our approaches were for nothing.

“We would go up and hit. We-’d block it; we’d dig it again;
we kept running to hit the ball. It was just very tiring," added
Haerr.

The Panthers were able to edge ahead of the Tornadoes in  A
the last few moments of the game, with Haerr bringingthe 
score to 14-13. With the Panthers’ next service chance, Luke «,2

Rubosky served the Panthers’ game point and ended the;,,-«!,«,
Tornadoes’ chances to come back.

Genetics

Continued from page 1
work for the national Genome
Project, according to Mulvihill.
The project, often called the
“moon shot of biology,” is a $3
billion, 1 5-year study to determine
where all human genes are
located. H A

“Although that’s been
controversial, it has been
launched,” Mulvihill said. I
, Mulvihill is also in the process
of applying for a $3 million grant
to study ways to keep researchers
interested in genetics.

Several research projects are
already under way or close to
gaining approval. Dr. ‘Michael
Lotze is currently waiting for
approval from the National
Institutes of Health to begin
treating patients with advanced
melanoma, a form of skin cancer,
by genetically increasing the ab-
ility of blood cells to ﬁght cancer.

“He’s ready to start once he
gets clearance. There_’s virtually
no problem. It’s just that the
committee doesn’t meet for two
months,” Mulvihill said.

Researchers have also targeted

other diseases:

-Dr. John Barringer is doing
basic research into using gene
therapy to treat Gaucherfs disease,
a hereditary condition that impairs
the body's ability to break down
fats. Some patients are currently
being treated by infusion of the
enzyme they lack, according to
Mulvihill.

“It works, but [Barringer] thinks
that the best solution is to get to
the heart of the matter and replace
the defective génewith the correct
one,” Mulvihill said. _,

-Dr. Eric Hoffman, who is
credited with identifying the de-

fective gene responsible for Du-«-

chenne muscular dystrophy, is
working on ways totreat this de-
bilitating disease, which usually
kills its victims before the age of
20. I‘ .

0 Patients with severe combined
immunodeficiency, or “bubble
children,” can be treated by
transplanting a certain gene into
bone marrow, according to
Glorioso. I

-Dr. Christopher Evans is
involved with a project to treat
rheumatoid arthritis by inhibiting

the action of interleukin-1, a
biochemical substance
responsible for cartiilage
inﬂammation and destruction.

“Gene therapy is notjust putting-
genes -into“ the 1 body:-» It-«also
involves cell transplantation,”
Glorioso said. “The idea is that
there may be, a, new ,_.forr_nW,of
cancer treatment in the works
that involves the patient’s own
cells.”

Glorioso said he was hopeful
that the institute could develop
into a treatment center for
Acquired Immune Deficiency
Syndrome victims within the next
year. _

“We’re in the process of
[recruiting] and have recruited
some new faculty who have done

_ research on vaccines for AIDS,”

he said. .

Facilities for the institute will
be spread throughout various
departments at Pitt, Glorioso said.

The institute will also deal with
the legal and ethical aspects of
gene therapy. According to
Mulvihill, the university is trying
to hire a person who holds a doc-
torate in philosophy and ethics.
8 “The knowledge of genetics
has been misapplied in this
century in Germany and in the
United States,” Mulvihill said.

In the early part of the century,
Nazi Germany used genetics to
try to establish an Aryan “master
race, ” Mulvihill said. The Germans
eliminated and sterilized Jews“
and Gypsies, whose genes they
didn’t want in Germany, he said.

. Mulvihill said that in the United

States the goyernme nt e,stablisl‘‘1e,'d' ?

a Eugenics Office inkthe ‘1”9”2os,’-3
think tank to research and
improve “good genes.” The office
ledto the sterilization of criminals
and the mentally retarded, as

well as to immigration restrictions . .

that prevented those with.

“undesirable” genes from coming I

to the United States.

“You have to be in favor of ,
good genes, but the truth is, we
all have bad genes. You have at
least eight bad genes in each one
of your cells,” Mulvihill said.

Mulvihill said that projects in
gene therapy need tobe approved
by both internal and external
review boards. He said that the

NOW RENTIN G

best way{ to police genetics
research is to have ‘an informed

public." East‘ I;iberty‘Presbyteri‘ar1'<i~*
Church and the institute will 

co-sponsoring a genetics seminar» _

entitled “Genetic” Engineering‘: ,

Tinkering with God’s Plan? on
Marc‘h'2." Mulvihillwill be oneof '
the '-key A spealke-rs  at the
conference.   _

“There ‘laiéll ‘a‘ number of

safeguards that the public, has to 6,
ensure the application of this A

knowledge. We want to explain
ourselves and be judged by our
neighbors,” Mulvihill said.

Glorioso said that gene therapy
will be used only for medical
treatments.

“We are not putting genes into
people to affectthe germ line.
What the gene does is produce a
kind of advanced pharmaceutic.
It cures the disease instead of just
treating the symptoms,” he said.

_ Mulvihill said that the Genetics
Institute could possibly become
as successful as Pitt’s organ-
transplant center.

“I’d like to think that the
Pittsburgh Genetics Institute
would —~ be ....’.;r_ecognized..,

internationallY.‘  lot of 

elements are in place right now;
it's just a matter of augmenting

’ them when necessary,” he said.

Glorioso said that the use of
genetics could even improve
transplantation procedures,
making more transplants possible, ‘
and at a lower cost? ‘  ‘S’

“Nowadays, you have to wait
for a kid to get banged up on the
road to get his organs. What
we”rel”’ta:lk‘ing ...a'bo"u‘t, . here"_is1 to _

take one organ and grow cells in 6
it bezable tojltreat thousands
oﬁ"patients,_” Glorioso_ said.

\."In a sense, geneutherapy is a .
refinement of. I  .organ:‘‘
transplantation,”. Mulvihill said. 1
“Instead of doing the whole organ I
orﬁithe cell, you’re just doing what;
you need —I— the gene.” 

“Glorioso said that the university f
is ‘providing considerable financial 
support to get the institute started. I
He said I that it may eventually
cost as much as $20 million to $308
million to get gene therapy
completely under way at Pitt.

“The university is clearly behind
it. They’re putting their money
where their mouth is,” he said.

According to Dr. Thomas Detre,
senior vice president for Health
Sciences, funding for the core

‘ facilities for the institute will also

be shared by Children’s Hospital,
Presbyterian’ University Hospital,
Magee—Women’s Hospital and
Western Psychiatric Institute &
Clinic.

“The basic funding to start it up
is $115 million,” he said. Detre
said that with other costs, such as.
recruiting top faculty, the 
may rise to between $2 million to V
$3 million. , *  »=

“They will have enough 
to cover [the costs of] recruiting;
new faculty members,” Detre said: _',

Detre also said that he hopes

I within two years to attract enough
