Pittsburgh First In Nation to Install Metropolitan CobIeTV       C

By JEFFREY S. GRUNEWALD
Pitt News Staff Writer
In a university project funded by three ‘of the four
companies vying for installation and operating rights of a
future Pittsburgh, cable television system, James
Edmondson, a graduate student and playwright, has
I analyzed local programming possibilities. ~
“The planning going into local programming is
staggering,” Edmondson said. “If the program is
successful here, it will undoubtedly spread all over the
country.”

i - Pittsburgh "City Council will award a contract Friday"

night to one of the companies to build and operate the
nation’s first metropolitan cable TV. system. The company
that is awarded the contract willhave exclusive cable TV

Besides the usual cable television services, Pittsburgh

residents will ‘be able to choose from six to 20 public

channels. . _
The report_was submitted to City Council as an informal

analysis of local production possibilities and is not a
recommendation. »

Brother Richard Emencker, supervisor of the Bureau of
Cable Communications, is studying the proposals and will

make a recommendation to Mayor Richard Caliguiri, who‘

will then award the contract with City Council approval.

With the award presentation less than one week away,
Emencker has yet to make his ﬁnal report. This has
prompted at least one council member to call for a one
month delay in awarding the contract. . ,_

Other problems, including two proposed ‘law suits,
threaten to postpone Friday"s award date. According to

Edmondson, however, it is very unlikely that the award -D ‘

presentation will be delayed. ‘

Helping Edmondson in nreparing the university project.’
1 were assistant professors Dr. William Hanks and Dr.

Terry Pickett and adjunct assistant professor Dr. Ray L.
Steele, all of the Department of Theater and Speech. '

In gathering the information and preparing the report,
Edmondson said, ‘‘I don’t know how much impact the
study will have, because it was not solicited by the mayor
or City Council.

whereasour report just concentrates on the local aspects.”

Included in all the bids were provisions for neighborhood

Poll Shows Students Favorlncrease A

By WALTER R. WATSON
Pitt News Staff Writer
A In a random sampling of Pitt
students, 66 percent were found to
be in favgr of the proposed student

activities fee ‘increase of $12 per i

term. The informal poll also
disclosed 18 percent against the fee
increase and 16 percent undecided.

The proposed activities fee of $24
a term, has been forwarded to vice
chancellor of student affairs, Dr.
Conney Kimbo. Included in the
proposal are plans to increase the
funds available to the Allocations
Committee, the Pitt Union Program
Council, and the Media.Publica-
tions Board. Each group will

recieve a percentage of the-.1otal .

funds collected, according to the
proposal. ‘

,,,_,_,0riginally undecided students
made their decision to oppose or

favor the fee hike based on

information given by the poolster
during the administering of the
poll. ,

Primarily freshmen and soph-
omoresfelt that if the additional
funding were used properly and for
its intended purposes, they would
approve of paying twice the
present activities fee. .

‘‘If it's for the good of most
students” and “As long as it
doesn’t end up in somebody’s
pocket” were typical of the
favorable freshmen and sophomore
opinions. ~

Some students believed that’
the increase would have to be‘ used
for “more than fun and games,” as
one student put it.

“/If it ' serves ’ an educational
purpose, I approve of the increas-
es, ’_.’»’said , Marcy Bonnet, ,a junior.

“If it’s just a social service, I’m
against it.” - _
“It hasn’t changed in 10 years.

tremendous,” _said
Heim.

Generally, students involved .in
student organizations of activities
were for the increase since many
extracurricular acitvities are linked
to monies allocated to the program
council and the Allocations commit-
tees

“I think that for the money, the
beneﬁts would be manifold. I have
heard people complain about the
concerts. I think the Allocations
committee would handle it wisely, ”
said Anne Redding, a third year
pharmacy student.

  OutofNation'sAcademic
s.Libraries Pitt Ranks 25th

/

By‘ PATTI LAN GFORD
Pitt News Staff Writer ,

The general consenus among Pitt’
students is that university libraries
rank high compared to other
college and university libraries in
the nation. »

f‘Hillman has a lot of ‘re-
sources,” said Mimi McKoy, a Pitt.
graduate of social work.

According to Glenora Rossell, '

‘l""director of Pitt’s libraries since

1970, Pitt ranks 25th out of 98
academic_ libraries in the nation

In addition to 'Hillman’s two
million-plus volumes, there is also
a machine data base that can help
students locate materials at other
schools not readily available .at
Hillman, -Rossell stated.

“There are a- lot of collections

There that students don’t know

9!

about, said Wiaam Magharious,
who works in the microﬁlm section.
“In education, for instance, we ‘
have more than ‘other libraries I’ve
been -to—defmitely more than
Carnegie,” she said.

Some -students, however, have
found Pitt libraries somewhat less
qualiﬁed.

Maggie Nuss,»a seniormajoring .-

ln PSy¢h010gy. said Pitt libraries do
not have near the ‘facilities as
Carnegie-Mellon University lib-
raries.

At Buhl Libraries-, for example,
she said she was held up several
weeks because the whereabouts of
books necessary to her research
were unknown to the librarians
there. In addition, no attempt was
made to help her locate the
books elsewhere, Nus_s said.

Income Tax Return

According to Steven Pietzek, a
worker in the current periodical

room, many Pitt graduate students
find Hillman lacking in materials,
but most students from other
colleges are pleased with Pitt
libraries.

Part of the problem, Pietzek
said, could be because Hillman has
open stacks, meaningthat students
obtain magazines on their own with
no record being made as to who
used what periodicals.‘ This
sometimes results in magazines
with articles torn out, he said.

“At Carnegie Library. how-
ever,” he continued, ‘-“they have

‘closed stacks (the librarian gives‘

out material only upon request).”

The mutilation of materials by
patrons is the worst problem of any
library, according to Rossell.
“Call it a national disease,” she
said. ’

Although there is some dissatis-
faction with Pitt libraries, most
students interviewed claimed to be
basically satisfied with both the
materials and the service. A

Jack Salva, who works at the
lending desk, says all employees of
the libraries are required to learn

‘ ‘the. call number system and7to

know where everything is before
they begin work. Those working in
special areas, such as reserved
books or current _periodicais, may
have on-the-job training but are
under constant supervision until
they are‘ fully trained, he said. _

A Salva added that he believed Pitt
libraries to be very organized and
accessible. . ‘

management and members of the
food service committee are,.plan-
ning ﬁeld trips to many food
management services and‘ other
colleges to examine alternatives
that may be more advantageous for

students, ‘noted the committee

members.

Key Management has been the_

food service at the university for
the past four or five‘ years,‘
according to Kinderman. .

For’ example, a point system is
used at .Carnegie-Mellon Univer-
sity, said Kinderman. ’ Students

pay for individual food items and '

the total meal cost is deducted from
/a board rated, members of the food
service committee said. . '_

At ' Pitt, noted Kinderman,

. students have unlimited amounts '

of food; availableto. them at" each

meal. ' ‘
SGB members Joe Blazer and

Mele, urged the committee to

' check the‘ prices and the quality of

-items and service. I ' Alleviating
waste, said mele,

Any change for renewal of a food‘
service contract added Kinderman,

would take 30 days and would be no ‘

problem to students attending Pitt

, “The Magic Bus.”

Ric Franzi, another senior in
favor of the increase, was part of
the task force that first investigated
the possibilities of a fee increase.

“My signature is affixed to the
task for,ce_memo. It’s for the good
of the students,”
“Even if they’re not part ofan

said Franzi.' '

Others seemed j_

process to stop its apparent
approval this fall, and saw their
role as one of tolerating the
increase as they would a table-
spoon of bad tasting medicine.

“I don't see that I’m getting
enough out of it, personally, and I
don’t think it will help _the
majority,” said Pitt junior Sue
Sachs.

“I understand why the increase
is needed. Everything else is going
up. It’s another thing that makes
you mad,” said sophomore Jeff
Fried. , .

“I pay enough already, because

- I’m paying out-of-state tuition, and

‘there’s more money,” said Antoin-
ette Rogers, another sophomore.
“It was my choice to come here, so
I’ll just accept it and continue to

attend Pitt. ’ ’

Joyce D’Antonio, a junior, felt
the increase should be done
gradually.

“Yes, I realize it hasn’t been
raised in many years, but I don’t
think it should be raised in one big
lump, not the first time. It should
be done over maybe two or three
years,” she said.

Some students expressed senti-
ments of having to pay more for
something eventually, and felt if an
increase were to be made any-
where, it may.as well be in the
student activities fee.-

“I don’t think that $12 is a lot «Si
money, and it would be put on
something else sooner or later,’
said one sophomore. -

The most frequent comment

those undecided or against was “I

really think it’s high enough
already.’-«’

The questions. were posed to
most Pitt students in the comfort of
their dorms. Many who didn't
know what the proposed increase
would do for them were undecided,
and changed their vote after given
the specifics of the proposal by the
pollster.

Most undecided voters who
changed their minds to back the
increase did so after
where the money would go.

Most of the students who

"changed their minds to vote against

the. increase asked’ the pollster how
much the student activities fee
increase would be and drew their

conclusion from cost alone.

WlIo’s Got That
Extra Ticket?

_ This past weekend, Pitt’s basketball team played
dthird-ranked Duke Blue Devils .at Fitzgerald Field
 House. The game was as exciting‘ as expected, well
 worth watching in person. However, many students
 were unable to do so because Of the unfair and
A ' inconsistent manner in which student tickets for home
games are distributed. . L

been understood that these tickets are to be available for
each game the day after the prior home game.

This wasn’t the case with the Duke game. Tickets
were distributed last Monday, the same day the
The many that had
always be1ieved——and not illOgica1ly—that these tickets
wouldn’t be available until’ Tuesday were out of luck‘
since all of the tickets were gone by Monday afternoon.
Only those students who were alerted, byiword of
mouth, were able to get tickets for this long-awaited
contest. , _

If it weren’t bad enough that tickets were handed out

L under the impression a day earlier than many students

‘believed, a number of enterprising fans took it upon
themselves to get more than their fair share of passes.

Some students armed-with a number of student ID’s (we'

heard of one case where someone had 16), besides their
own and others who-made use of their own ID more

themselves. .

Under the'Old~ validation system that was in use as
recently as last term, these ticket-grubbing students
would have _run into some difficulty in obtaining so
many passes. a
would have been indicated on their validation that they
had already received their ticket. I .

' We are sure some {students with more than a single
ticket for the game did indeed pass them on to other
students. We are equally sure some students were able I

to profit monetarily from the entire deal. That should '

surprise no one, least of all those responsible for Pitt’s

new system of validation and its method of distribution .

of passes-to home basketball games. In fact, these
people have created a procedure that encourages ticket-
hoarding and illegal scalping. A . ‘

in -which to check whether a student has taken

advantage of a “one timeonly offer” that term, unless

it’s to vote for Student Government Board members or 1
homecoming queen.

As far as the distribution of basketball tickets for
students, Student Activities has failed to see to the
posting of the times when tickets for each game first
become available. The office has also failed to see that
each student is given as fair an opportunity to ‘obtain a
pass as another student. _ . . _

The new sticker validation system seems a more,
practical method in » many respects, abut the

‘inconvenience of carrying a second card under the old

system is a small price to. achieve a measure of equal
treatment for students. . '
Although there will be no more crowds in the Field
House/this year like the one Saturday night, student
tickets will continue to be precious items—particularly
if Pitt remains in first place in the Eastern Eight.
Upcoming key games ‘against West Virginia and

-Villanova could produce a “Duke—like” rush for tickets._

Two steps should be taken immediately to prevent
further abuses of a poorly-handled distributionsystem:
First, no tickets to ya‘ game should be given out until
the previous gameshas been played. Tickets should
become ‘available the morning after. the‘ most

. recent——home or away—game has been played. That

way’ everyone will know when passes will beavailable.
Second, only one ticket should be given to each
customer. No morecoming to the ticket office with the
ID’s of friends, enemies, roommates or pets. 7‘
Students should help enforce these rules. It seems the
only other alternative would be to make students pay
for their tickets. _If there is_ a profit to be "made, the
basketball program ought to get a fair piece of_ the
actipn. ' A ‘ I '

It almost goes without saying
that there is a certain stigma

freely from the "students (and
sometimes from The Pitt’ News)

Pitt News Staff Writer

“I don’t think we _can get
anything more out of our guys.

They do everything we ask,” said a
digappointed Tim Grgurich, after
his Panthers dropped a tough 78-69
game to the mighty Duke Blue
Devils before a packed Field House

crowd Saturday night.

Could Pitt upset Duke for ‘the
second consecutive year? Could
they handle Duke’s band of poised,
talented, Atlantic Coast Con-
ference-hardened athletes? At
times, the answer was a very
deﬁnite yes. But two crucial
lapses, at the absolute beginning
and end of the game, spelled defeat
for Pitt.

After Duke’s pressure defense
gave the Devils early leads of 11-2,
then 21-10, Duke Coach Bill Foster
rested several of his starters,
while’, at the same time, Grgurich
inserted Dave Olinger in an effort
to boost Pitt’s struggling_ offensive
attack. 3 '

The moves paid immediate
dividends. Olinger‘ hit ﬁve long
jumpers, Sam Clancy dominated
underneath, the Pitt defense forced
Duke turnovers, and Pitt took a
26-25 lead; 3' .

V The Devils rallied in the ﬁnal two
minutes, and led 33-29 at the half.

The Panthers started the second

half with their ‘ ‘quick’~’ front line of

Clancy, Sammie Ellis and'Lennie
McMillian. Ed Scheuermann
started the ‘game at center, but was
removed after several minutes,
putting" Pitt at a distinct height
disadvantage against 6’11 Mike
Gminski and 68 Gene Banks. But
as has been the case for two
/seasons, Pitt was able to hold its
own on the boards, factually
outrebounding Duke, 39-38.
The second half was a nerve-
Awravcking see-saw affair,’ with
several lead changes and missed
opportunities by both- teams.
Carlton Neverson’s basket at 10:56
gave Pitt a 51-48 lead, _ then
D-wa-yne Wallace and (Ellis con-
verted pairs of free throws, among
‘three straight _Duke_ buckets by
Vince Taylor, to knot the game at
58. -

Outrageous. The word can be

taken two ways. But when Ray
I Reilly, head coach of the Panther

A-« men’s volleyball team, used the

word‘ he was smiling from ear to
ear. Actually, anyone involved

’ with the second-year team was all’

 smiles on Saturday afternoon. i

The Panthers easily disposed of-
their ﬁrst opponent of the season,
George Mason University, when
theytook the best-of-ﬁve match by
three games to none. The Panthers
beat the Patriots by scores of 15-12,
15-5 and 15-9." ’

“These guys just played totally
outrageous volleyball,” said Reilly
after the three-game win. “I must

.w-- say that they performed much

I better than I had expected them to
-in our first game of the season.”

“The set selection from‘ the
coaches (Reilly is assisted by Mike
Hebert) helped us out a good
deal,” said Robins. “We’ve
worked hard for a long time, and
Saturday’s game showed that all t
that work is going to pay off.”

“It was a total_ team effort by
everyone,” added Robbins, ‘who
thought the Panthers put in their
best performance when _in the first
game of the match. ’

—Pitt opened up scoring in that

throughout the entire three game
series, Pitt led by two to three

"points until the game point was. ,5

scored and the Panthers were on
top 15-12. The game included‘
some excellent defensive plays by .

. Danny O’Donnell and Don Hardin.

“lthought that we played some

‘great defense," said newcomer
-Dave Baird, who played all three
‘games; “Everyone_,p1aye,dpsowell V

At the 4:46 mark, Pitt took what
was to have been their biggest and

\.

had a good time along with winning V

the match.”

Reilly’s lineup stayed pretty
much the same throughout all three
contests. Starters in ‘the initial
game were Robbins, Hardin,
O’Donnell, Baird, Jim Grant and
captain Jeff Beavers. Four of the
starters . are freshmen. Grant was
replaced by sophomore Ricky
Camacho in the last two games of
the match. ‘

by a 15-Sscore. The game was tied '

up at three points apiece when the
Panthers took off on a six-point
scoring spree. After the Patriots

scored two points it was, again, all

- in the Panthers hands. The game

picked up the momentum that the‘
Panthers ‘needed to take three
straight and to leave the courts
playing only three of the possible
five games. The team appreciated
the early conclusion of Saturday’s

‘ match, because. yesterday they

participated in another match, the
Penn State Invitational. ’

65-62.

“We had them, we just gave it to
’em,” Grgurich remarked after the
game. “We did everything we
wanted to do. I wanted Dwayne

Wallace at the foul line, because he .  A

makes them. Iwanted ’Bam’ going

way he did. We can execute,.we

just have to put the ball in the I

basket.”
The ﬁnal two minutes of the
game" were a succession of Pitt

fouls and perfect freethrows by the ‘

Devils, who put the game away by
hitting 14 consecutive freebies at
game’s end. . v.

Despite the great effort by his
undermanned squad, Grgurich
would hear nothing of ’moral
victories’.

“Our program’s at the pointw
where we just. wanted to win the ‘

game, ” he said. “We felt we could.

play with them and beat them.”
“I thought we stayed with them

on the glass, defensively. We

._-  '

. in there for a-three-point play the 

made them bring Gminski away 

from the basket more than I think
they wanted to.”

Also hurting Pitt’s.cause were .
the foulings out of Ellis and j

McMillian. Ellis left the game with '
just over seven minutes remaining,‘

‘and his absence was felt, according _

to Grgurich. 6 .
“We felt that we could get our ‘

' 1

two guys with four fouls through x. in i

the game, but it was unfortunate‘
they didn’t.. Without him,(E1lis) it

takes something away from our M
offense, because he's our player;-3

they traveled north to Chicago for
But,
this week, the problem was not the
judges; it was the team. Pitt

 

, finished sixth, scoring 127.35.

‘I have no idea what happened,’
said coach Donna Sanft. * ‘We have

‘ usuallybeen consistent and not

Holly Martino and Bonnie Tressler
were the high scorers for Pitt.
Each had an 8.0.

‘Holly is the only one who didn’t
fall off the beam,’ Sanft said.
‘Bonnie had one fall but still scored
well.’ ‘

The p’antherettes, now rattled.
according to Sanft, moved to the
ﬂoor exercise. ‘Three gymnasts
performed good routines, including
Babbie Flock, Roxanne Evans and
Martino, who had the high score
for Pitt, 8.0.

said Sanft. “The top score was
well within our reach.-”

That top score of 133.85 was
-posted by Louisville. Minnesota
was -second, Illinois-Champagne
third, Nebraska fourth and South-
ern Illinois ﬁfth.

Three of the Pantherettes are
having ankle problems, and Sanft
said those injuries could have ‘had
something to do with the bad’ meet.

Tressler and Evans are still
nursing injuries they've had all
season, while Flock hurt her ankle
last weekend.

The low score will not hurt the
Pantherettes’ chances of making
nationals because of a revision in
qualiﬁcations. Instead of the
seasonal average counting for
two-thirds of the qualiﬁcation score

and regionals counting one~third,
the reverse will be true. _
“It’s more important to do well
at ‘regionals this season,” said
Sanft. “Myra Bachuchin should be
back in competition by then and
that will help us greatly. Basically.
we haven’t yet put together four
good events in one meet, and that
is what we need to do.”

(Continued from page 11)

This was the "only score of the
period as both teams played with
more intensity while checking
much more closely than they did
in the first period.

The second period also provided
a splendid goaltending display by
Newell, a senior from Shaler.
Duquesne had two ppwer play
opportunities, resulting in the most
pressure the Dukes applied against
Pitt. Newell stood ﬁrm in goal and
ﬂicked away several difficult shots‘
from close range. ‘ »

The penalty "killers then .,took
charge and ended the Duquesne

, threat. This was to be the Dukes’

best offense of the "period in
totaling only five shots-on7goal
compared to Pitt’s 11.

Duquesne came out for the third
like they ended "the
second--very ﬂat--and the ‘Panthers’

quickly took advatage, scoring at
1:38 on a goal by Verne Shaver, a
sophomore defenseman. The
‘assist went to. goalie Newell. Then,
about ﬁve minutes later, Pitt made
it a 4-1 game with a goal by center
Curt Hetz. He was assisted by
winger Cliff Zieger_and Zangrilli,
his second assist of the day.

At this point the Panthers were

‘clearly outplaying the Dukes and

threatened to break the game open.

But Duquesne refused to quit.
With about seven minutes left to
play, lightning struck twice as
winger Mike Bowes and defense-
man Jay Esil scored within 40
seconds to cut the Panther lead to
one goal. --

The momentum had swung to

the Duquesne side as the hitting _

became even harder. The last two
minutes of the game had frantic

Mile Relay Team Wins,

Mclntyre,/LeekMVP’s  

By STEVE THOMAS

' Pitt News Staff Writer ‘

Larry Shippen came from behind
on the final lap in leading the Pitt
mile. relay team to a first-place
finish in the ﬁnal event of the 11th
annual Pitt Invitational track meet

I this past weekend.

Shippen who was the ‘anchor-
man’, took the lead about halfway
through the final lap and pleased
an enthusiastic but sparse crowd at =
he
crossed the ﬁnish line in one of,‘-the
most exciting events of the meet.

Shippen, was aided by team
members’ Bud Cooper, Al Coles
and Dwayne DeFoor, who kept the
race close while finishing with a
time of 3:21. -

Head coach . Mike Agostinella
was pleased with the track team’s
aggressiveness but not with the
team’s overall results.

“We ran. into some trouble along
the way,” Agostinella said. “There
were some pleasing events here
and there but we didn’t do as well
as we should have done. I guess
we did fairly well overall, consider-
ing some of the guys were sick with
the "flu and Darren Geary’s injury.

Agostinella was referring to the

7"I,000-yard run in which Geary was

accidentally spiked by another
competitor and required stitches to
close the wound.

“He will be out of action for a
while but hopefully not too long,”
said Agostinella. ,

Meanwhile, Gary. Siriano, who

last year won the mile run in the
Pitt Invitational, ﬁnished fourth in
the two-mile run with a time of
8:56.9. In doing so, he set a
personal record. ‘
Larry Kinney of Pitt was runner-

" up in the triple jump for the second

consecutive year, ﬁnishing behind
Herman McIntyre (of East Caro-
lina. Kinney recorded a leap of

,1s.4s meters} E F -

Another second-place I finisher
for the Panthers was Eric Crist,
who soared in_the pole vault. Tom
Jacobs of Slippery Rock matched
Crist’s mark and was also credited
with a seco d-place ﬁnish. Ship-
pen, while leading the mile relay

team_to victory, also placed third in»

the 440-yard dash with a time of
49.8. Also impressive for Pitt was
Earl Cooper, who ran the 60-yard
dash in 1:13, good for seventh
place.

Mclntyre was named the Most
Valuable Field Performer ofthe
Tennesseefs Adrian Leek were
co-winners of the Most Valuable
Track Performer Award. Ken
Glover, high jumper from eastern
Kentucky, also achieved great

‘honor as he leaped and tiedthe
meet record originallyset by Pitt’s
Tim Riley in 1974.

Newell kept coming up big.

Then, in what could have been a
fatal mistake, Hetz was called for a '
penalty with 26 seconds left. This ‘
set the stage for a Duquesne power
play opportunity for the remaining
but the Panther defense
didn’t crack and Newell made two
more saves to preserve the victory.

Between the second and third
periods, coach Greg Stein wasn’t
totally pleased by P_itt’s 2-1 lead. _

“I [thought we were letting.

keep on pushing offensively and

not to sit on the lead.”

,They,had them, they had them.
That’s what probably best des-
cribes last night’s Pitt-Duke game.
They had them but they couldn’t
put them away. For 38 minutes the
Panthers‘ appeared on.their way to
a tremendous win, but down the
stretch when it counted most they
couldn’t buy a bucket.

The sellout crowd of 5,308 was
treated to some of the best basket-
ball to date. Duke showed ‘why it
deserves to be ranked No. 3 in the

«nation, and Pitt proved that it

" belongs «. with the nation's best

teams.

—Both teams performed admir-
ably. ‘Nothing separated them until
those final minutes when Duke took
control of the game. The Bis".
Devils seemed to want the game
more, so they went out and
grabbed the victory.

With 2:37 left in the contest, Pitt
led 65-63 and their best free throw
shooter, Dwayne Wallace, was at

' the line. The upset looked within

reach. The foul shot would have

forced Duke to come twice down the

ﬂoor to score, but Wallace missed.
‘From then on it was all downhill.

Four times Pitt came down the
floor with a two-point lead and
every time failed to increase it.
Sam Clancy, who played a superb

/ game as he hit for 16 points and

controlled the boards with 17
rebounds, explained those last -few
minutes.

“Against Duquesne’ we knew
we were going to win it,” he said.
“At the end we talked to each other
and went out and got it. Tonight,
everybody was tense, nobody

I talked, and we weren’t ready to
take it.”

Some insiders said they felt it
would be an accomplishment if Pitt
even stayed with the Blue Devils,
but to Pitt coach Tim Grgurich, a
win was on his mind. '

“I knew we could play with
them; we wanted to win this game
and played accordingly,’-’ he said.

“There was no kind of morale .

victory or anything like that,’1_we
just lost a very big game.”

“Foul shots really killed us,”
said Pitt’s Carlton Neverson after
the game. “We tried to be patient
and take a good shot but they just
weren’t falling in. All that matters
is the final score.”.,

Coach Bill Foster of Duke had-

high praise for his

opponent.

beaten

“It was a real struggle for us;

they were very tough,” Foster

said. “I hope they keep it going
because they're a fine ballclub.”

‘Superlatives can be thrown left
and right, especially from ‘the

. winning coach, but when getting

down to basics the story of the
game was this: Duke hit its last
eight foul shots and won the
ballgame. Like true champions,
the team showed its mettle and
conquered. For Pitt, well, it almost
made it. P I

By MARGERY METERS

, /M I | S __ In early 1979, four musicians collaborated with four political activists.

' ' ' -- ' members were interested in setting up a series of media events that

could ultimately raise millions of dollars toward a non-nuclear future.

Almost non-existant a decade ago,
theatre has begun to‘? blossom in
Pittsburgh. Along with numerous
collegiate companies, Pittsburgh Public
Theater, Theatre Express and several
other companies provide solid seasons of
stage entertainment, ranging from "
classics to the avant-garde. If you doubt
the validity of Pittsburgh’s theater

The Pittsburgh‘Playhouse, at the brink
of extinction just ten years ago, now
offers entertainment nightly in the form
of films, plays, children’s‘ drama,
concerts and special_ events. The
Playhouse also serves as the head-
quarters for the Playhouse ‘Theater
Company, The Playhouse, Jr., Point
Park Theater Company, and the ’
American Dance ensemble. ,

Besides the Steelers and the Pirates,
-there is certainly plently more to be proud
of. ~But that’s not to say that
entertainment in Pittsburgh is all it
should be. It could stand its share of
enrichment.

This city still sorely lacks a ﬂourishing »

somewhere between The Decade's 250

As I, sat glued to my T.V. last Sunday,
watching my beloved Steelers prove to
the rest of the country what we here in the
Steel City have known for a long time, I
couldn't help but feel intensely proud of
the city of Pittsburgh—its sports teams,
its beauty, its character, its simplicity and
its people.

Pittsburgh, as a city and as a
community of people, has come a long
way. Not only during this past decade
but just 50 years ago Pittsburgh was
perceived by its critics and often by its

inhabitants.as"‘Hell with the lid arr.“

Now the city is in the midst of its
second “Renaissance” and as millions of
World Series fans realized last October,
Pittsburgh is a breathtakingly pic-
turesque area as well. . V

As our sports teams consistently covet
the words, “world’s best,”‘ other
characteristics of Pittsburgh; continue to
thrive, expandand progress almost by «
the,day. %

The entertainment scene is just one of
them. Yes there's room for improvement
in many other areas-—potholes, PennDot,
City Council, et al, but just take a look at
what we've got entertainment-wise.

The Pittsburgh Ballet Theater, (PBT),

  Rock n’Roll Joins Together To Fight" The Nukes

(Continued from page 1)
they were organized by the
musicians and activists themselves,
rather than record companies,
lawyers, and managers. The result
being an initial proﬁt of nearly a
quarter of a million dollars.

In a statement of purpose I
 published by MUSE, the primary
focus of concern is that we develop
cleaner, more efficient forms of

furthering safe and long-term
employment. They advocate
nuclear ﬁssion only to the extent
that it be used to decommission
those power_plants already built,
and for the disposal of those wastes
already created.
MUSE is opposed to the growing
‘ ‘plutonium economy, ” and to the
careless supervision of the atomic
industry. In the 56-page concert
program book, examples of the
ominous dangers of power plants
are cited, and many of the accidents
that have happened are shown to be
due to poor regulation. One of the
strangest of these incidents is the
“SL-1 event” of 1961, in which
’ three men died brutally over what ,
appeared to be a love triangle. V
What they left behind was a
dangerous amount of radioactivity, '
and it could not be properly buried,
for fear of contaminating the
environment. -
Bonnie Raitt, a founding member

of MUSE, first became aware of the
dangers of the nuclear industry in
1974, when she read about Karen
Silkwood’s death. Ironically, the
concert tickets found in Silkwood’s

energy, with greater capabilities for '

car, when she died, were for a
concert that Raitt and Jackson
Browne would give just a few days
later. -
The Silkwood case has been one
3f the major forces behind the
growing fear of nuclear power. In
another article in the MUSE concert
program, Denis Hayes warns ‘that/
“Reliance on nuclear power as the
principle source of energy is
probably possible only.in a

_ totalitarian state. ’ ’ \He refers to the

report that anti-nuke alliances have
recently become infiltrated by
government agents.

The members of'MUSE have
decided that they have enough
inﬂuence to take matters out of the
hands of industry, and into their
own, by funding groups and
projects aimed at protesting the
power plants, and educating the
public as to the dangers of allowing
power companies to manipulate the
lives of their future generations.

In early November, the staff of
the MUSE Foundation met to
review over ﬁve hundred proposals,
submitted before Aug. 1-, from .
anti-nuclear/ pro solar groups all _
over the country. Screening the
proposals was difficult, according to
MUSE staffer Susan Kellam,
because almost all the groups were
considered urgent for funding.
Finally, the concert profits were
granted to more than 210 groups.
More than two thirds of the proﬁts
went to local and regional grass
roots organizations; ﬁghting
nuclear reactors, the nuclear
weapons industry, and pro-solar
projects, and the money was

Steve Wyman Makes Pitt

Theater.Debut With ‘Criminals’

By CAMILLE WOLF

‘ ‘The more I do, the more Ifeel
able to do. People who work in the
theater as I do, fear inactivity the A
most. We don’t fear exhaustion,
because we are used to working
when we are exhausted. I~feel quite
at home going on nervous energy
and coax. ’ ’ ‘ ' _

Steve Wymen leaned back on the
ﬂoor cushion, clasping his hands as

‘ ifto contain the energy and excite-
ment rupting within. His face is
enthusiastic, demanding and
glowing with the thrill of a man who

I is doing exactly what he wants, how
he wants it, at a pace which can
never be fast enough.

Wymen is a newcomer to Pitts- '
burgh theatre- goers. He is an '
associate professor of theater at
Pitt, arriving last term from Texas.
At present he is the artistic director
for the City Theater Company, a

. )1

:52 ’ professional municipal company.

Last year he directed ‘ ‘The’Shadow,
Box’ ’ for the National Theater of r
Chili. Wymen has directed over 15
plays in Spain and Texas, including
musicals, Shakespeare and classics.
“The Criminals” directed by
Wymen, his first play at the,univer-
sity, will open Feb. 6, in the Studio
. Theater. -
“The Criminals” was

Latin,American.studies. The-play is
to be a central part of a series of
events celebrating the month of
February as Latin American month;
Wymen selected ‘ ‘The ’
+2. Criminals’ ’ believing that this Latin
American play would be successful
for contemporary American
audiences. ' » V . . >
“The play is something 0
_ universal interest.‘ Feelings that

commissioned by the department of _

children harbor toward their
parents, why they harbor these
feelings, and the kind of society

— which causes these feelings," he

explained. 
‘ ‘Criminals’ ’ has only three ~
performers. John Lang and Kate

- Bowen are university students,
. Katie Karlovitz is a professional

actress. According to Wymen, the
play is very, very intense. The
students bring afreshness and
vitality to the work, and the pro-
fessional actress offers her
experience. M

‘ ‘Everyone isleading everyone
else toward the ﬁnal product, ” he
said. A

Steve Wymen’s face became
solemn when asked about fears
with the production. ‘ ‘I have fears
about every show that I do, because
I am aware of what the
responsibility is of the performers
to please the audience,” he said.

Wymen believes that students

I have the potential to get the most

out of the play, Wymen said. “The

., study of-.,the theater and_ acting I

enriches‘ ones life and is the very
best education about yourselfthat
you can every possibly ge .”

Wymen’s own introduction to a
play did not occur until he attended
the University of Michigan. He was
an extra in a university production
of the ‘ ‘Merchant of Venice. ’ ’ He
watched the show 48 times that
season and cried every time.

Wymen said,‘ ‘ ‘I thought this was
a really worthwhile thing to do with
your life,_ trying to express what it is
like to be human.”

When asked if he preferred
directing rather than acting,
Wymen explained, “for me it is all
creation. I love to do everything in

the theater. I like changing and

generally directed toward
organizational support rather than
for speciﬁc projects.

John Hall, founding member and

I president of MUSE said, ‘ ‘Because

of our commitment to broadening
the movement, proposals were
explicitly solicited from minority,
feminist, labor and rural groups. ’.’
This round of funding is only the
beginning. During the ﬁve~day
occupation of Madison Square
Garden, twenty hours of music was
recorded on a 24-track mobile
recording unit, donated bylthe .
record plant. Then MUSE artists
had less .than three months to
evaluatetracks and decide what to
include on the album. The tracks
had to be mixed and sequenced,
and ﬁnally packaged and released.
Most of the responsibility fell on the

f shoulders of producers Jackson

Browne, John Hall, Bonnie‘Raitt,
and Graham Nash. But the album
lists the names of hundreds of
people who donated their time and
energy toward the success of the
project.
Joe Smith, chairman of V

Elektra/ Asylum explains that the

I company stands to make very little

profit from the album, due topthe
enormous production costs. He
adds that Elektra/ Asylum is
honored to «be involved with the
MUSE Foundation.

In addition to the revenue they
expect fromgthe “No Nukes”
album, the concerts were ﬁlmed by
Academy Awardwinners Barbara
Koppel and Haskell Wexler, and
the movie will be released in the
near future. The MUSE board

axc‘:

Steve Wyman

intends to direct future grants
(expected to be in the millions from
the album alone) to maintaining

L strong emphasis on national

safe-energy groups, and to help
ﬁnance a media campaign aimed at
educating the public on energy
issues. ’ '

MUSE has been described as a
merger of communities. The
musicians and activists create a .
unique organization that is at once

chaotic and efﬁcient. Furthermore, .

MUSE do not consider their efforts
a symbiosis of art and politics, but
more of a collaboration. Jackson
Browne admits to using the
inﬂuence of his music, in order to
make a political statement.
However, he claims that the power
of a musician's inﬂuence is nothing
compared to the hard-sell power of
the corporations that are
victimizing their public. More than
100,000 fans paid $18.50 a seat, and
orchestra pit seats were reserved
for $100 donors is clear evidence
that the musicians are enjoying the
success of their efforts. '
Graham Nash states, ‘ ‘In these

years of madness, to condemn our
children’s children’s children to
evolutionary extinction is obviously

‘ - mentally sick. I realize that I as an

individual must do all I can to help
stop the uncontrollable build-up of
deadly nuclear wastes that threaten
humanity itself. ’ ’ I
As with all the other artists who
donated far more than good
performances to the anti-nuclear
movement, Nash feels a sort of res-
ponsibility to use his star power as a
weapon against nuclear power. '

‘I love doing everything in the Theater. ’

m°vins<§1r<>.t.!ne1afv:;1t..siv<:::.m<tv‘an
emotional ﬂexibility. I wouldn’t
like to lose that flexibility by
becoming only a director. ’ ’

His inability to become
exhausted is self-evident. Steve
Wymen is presently working on
three plays, all of which will open
next week. The plays are: “The
Criminals, ’ ’ ‘ ‘Sexual Perversity in
Chicago,” and “The Pittsburgh
Variations. ’ ’ Wymen is directing
all three plays and is playing the
lead role in ‘ ‘Chicago.” All three
will be performed in the Studio
Theater. ‘ ,

Wymen is thrilled at using the
Studio Theater, especially for “The

I The Possessed

Directed by Bill Royston
Pittsburgh Laboratory Theatre

According to playwright Leon Katz, the
stage adaptation of “The Possessed,”
like Dostoyevsky’s classic novel, “Begins

in the vein of satiric comedy, moves into -

drama, and culminates in devastating
tragedy.” True enough‘, laughs in the
ﬁrst act of the Laboratory Theatre
production dissolve during the building

intensity of the middle tw_t_) acts which.

ﬁnally explodes in the ultimate’ despair

and destruction of the fourth act. ~

The story revolves around Stavrogin, a
handsome, young Russian aristocrat who

is seemingly possessed by the devil. Help

is a man of inﬁnite strength who doesn’t
knowwhere to apply it. He is a man of
whim; his motives for action dissolve in
apathy to follow-through. He is a
wanderer.

It is the capriciousness of Stravrogin’s

political, religious and social psychology
that truely possess his personality. The
devil -is only symbolic of Stravrogin’s
nihilism.

. Although he remains aloof, Stavrogin
has tremendous impact on the lives of the
people around him. For example, to
Peter and a small cult of radical followers,
Stavrogin is ‘an idolized inspiration.. Yet

Stavrogin lends no support and the group '

is left to wallow in its own cowardice and

iAmerican Buffalo’: Misconceptions At

By THOMAS PALMER

" “American Buffalo”

Directed by Robert Koch
The Fine Line Theatre Company

Somewhere in the lives of Donny (Fred
Donatelli), Bobby (John Waterson), and
Teach (Robert Koch), there is an insipid
realism lurking. There gestates a
self-respect for reasons so base and
misconstrued that they fascinate one with
their illogic. The ideas contained in
“American Buffalo” are hunting us

down, and threatening us with our‘
glaring mortality.

Mamet is so ﬁnely encase in its colloquial
rhetoric that it nearly transcends us to

disillusionment.

Director Royston likens Stravrogin to
such contemporary ﬁgures as Charles
Manson and Jim Jones. He is looked
upon as a leader not because he has
chosen (or not chosen) to be viewed as
such, but because of the sheer intensity of
his persona. In the end, however,
everyone, including Stavrogin himself, is

being more than an audience. The play
revolves around three men, milling in
the preciousness of their ideals an
misconceptions. . -

musty smell that immediately comments
on the men we are about to meet.

Donny holds the strongest sense ‘of
self. He reveals himself in the opening
scene with Bobby, a boy who seems so
overwhelmed with life itself that is more
like a padded wall. He trusts Donny and
listens to -his advice, yet always ends up
following his own, almost animalistic
instinctive behavior.

Ludlam’s‘Stage Blood’

By MARK HOLAN

Stage Blood

- Directed by William Turner

Theatre Express,

It sounded like a great idea; Theatre

Express becoming the first company to be ~ 4

granted performance rights to a work by
Charles Ludlam. The play, “Stage
Blood," sounded great too; a road
company of actors stuck in Mudville,
U.S.A. without an Ophelia for its
production of “Hamlet.” ‘But alas,

there's that old -cliche '-about’) ‘ 'wh‘at‘lo‘oks A

good on paper...”

. ‘There are two problems with this

production. First, “Stage Blood" is not
one of Ludlam’s best plays. Produced by
Ludlam and his Ridiculous Theatrical
Company in 1974, “Stage Blood," at its
best, only foreshadows the absurd genius
that Ludlam has perfected in recent
years. ‘At its worst, which is about
two-thirds of the script (or 60% too much
for an audience to cope with), “Stage
belongs back in the dusty
Off-Off Broadway lofts of New York

I where Ludlam and others developed
‘Theater of the Ridiculous; '

Secondly, Theatre Express has done a

sloppy job of performing the play. Of '

course, like the script, there are bright

moments. Ron Ferro and Janet Reed,
both making their debut at Theatre
Express, turn in spirited performances,
as does Claudia Zahn. Overall, however,
there seems to be a high level of anemia
in the stage blood of the cast.

“Stage Blood” is .Ludlam’s metaphor
for the unquenchable desire to get up on
stage and perform before an audience.
It’s best exempliﬁed by Elﬁe Fey (Janet
Reed), the young town girl who ﬁlls in as
Ophelia. It’s also represented by Jim
Jenkins (Ken Stirbl), stage manager of

the touring ACtru‘ca_isan, _'‘I‘heatricalNCom- ’

third act of “Stage Blood”) Jenkins
previewshis new experimental play for
the company, using Fey as his leading
lady. The ensuing scene is a brilliant
parody of the opening scene in Anton
Chekov’s “The Seagull” and probably
the best moment in “Stage Blood.”
Several members of the audience at
Theatre Express, however, neverpmake it
to the third act of “Stage Blood." The
play is too long, too loose-knit and too
poorly. produced. Charles Ludlam was
scheduled to attend one of Theatre
Express’s productions of “Stage Blood."
One staff member at the company stated
“We hope he doesn't show-tip."
Certainly, it could prove embarrassing to
both parties. A

his part and he-maintains it consistantly

Donny sells a buffalo nickel for $90
to a coin collector who happens to be

it back in order to gain a better sale with‘

lackluster self-centerness renders him
almost a total incompetent.

compliment to the cast but also to Katz’s
script which translated Dostoyevsky’s far»

"Royston has made ﬁne use of his new

Martin’s‘Jerk’ Sur

By THOMAS PALMER

The Jerk
Directed by Carl Reiner

Steve Martin has melted down “Cruel
Shoes” and all his nightclub routines into
the celluloid hybrid called “The Jerk.”
His first screen effort, ,written in

J collaboration with Carl Gottlieb ,and

Michael Elias, is a base for, as most of the
film is, the actualization of the comic’s
idiosyhcratic humor
actions.

The poor black child joke seemed to
have runits course until Martin brought it
tothe screen. Somewhere in that opening
sequence of Navin Johnson (Martin)
fumbling in his attempts to pick up
rhythm, there is a sudden innocent bond
between Navin and his audience. -He's
just a nice guy with a penchant for dumb
luck and a need to establish his

_ individuality. Strange twists of fate will

follow this man, and Director Reiner
milked them for as much as he can_get.
The crescendoing music and slow motion
sequence of Johnson catching Stan F0x’s
(Bill Macy) glasses at the gas station lets

us know right away that neither Reiner or

Martin aren’t trying to pull an intriguing
story out of the muck of some outrageous
comedy. A ridiculous success story is
imminent, and that the sequence cues the
ﬁlm-goer to loosen up and sit back for the
entirity. , . . ~ .
The employment of this type of attitude
in the film gives both writer and director a
free rein to take us on the cinematic trip
of their choice, without expecting us to
ask questions: to try to tie up the loose
ends.. Flaming redhead -Patty Bernstein

chgook, performed equally well by Roger

for nature and mutual respect for the two
worlds to which Bumppo belongs. The
four broadcasts provide colorful insight
into the nature of people's lives during
the territorial battles between the French,
Americans, and Indians.

Fenimore Coopers classics “The Deer-
slayer,” “The Last of the Mohicans,”
and “The Pathfinder” were condensed
and used to make Natty Bumppo an
adventurous and sensitive human being
who possesses a sense of justice and fair
play that wins our sympathyand respect
through episodic fashion.

any student who has written on lined

substructure. Girts Purins, active Pitt
faculty member, noticed the frequency
and diversity of grids in his own and other
artists’ works and came up with the idea
of basing an exhibition on grids. He
coordinated the new show at the UP
Gallery, “Grids: System, Symbol,
Subject.”

“lt’s the first time a show in Pittsburgh
"has been assembled’ on this theme.
Public reaction has been very favorable,”
Purins remarked.

The show previewed on January 1'0 and
will be at the gallery through Feb. 4. It is
located on the corner of Forbes Avenue
and South Bouquet Street.

On display at UP.Gallery are 36 works:

The exhibition’s unity, created by the ’

use of the grid, is contrasted with the role
it plays in each artists’ work. James
Nestor treats the three-dimensional grid

as a system in his scultures of brick and»

wood. “Missing Game” is four compact
levels of brick, while “Forgetten
Assault” is similarly interlocking pieces
of raw wood. His smallest piece,
“Victim,” reveals his reason for using
"the grid. _ .

“It enables me to reveal the darkest
side of my mind, through non-narrative
means,” Nestor states.

The intensity of Nestor’s pieces are
balanced by a stability from his reliance
on 90-degree angles.‘ Reminiscent of
mausoleums, the pieces work especially
well and are-small enough to allow full
examination by the viewer.

The grid as a symbol is reﬂected in the
series of stratifications in Girts Purin’s
paintings. The warm earth tones and

Horatio Alger-type values of long ago in a
world where these attitudes no longer
’hold up. The abject literalism of it seems,
at times, that it is trying to find its roots in
Beckett.

stabilize as much as it implies movement,
like quickly flipping cards. 9

“The grid has evolved in my paintings
as a metaphor for, time and space,”
Purins said.

The study of the grid itself rises in the
works of Jon Beckley ‘ and_ Louise
Pierucci-Holeman. Beckley’s pencil
drawing “Grid Line,” and razor drawing
“Grid Cut” are simple, obvious
representations of grids; the first a series
of quarteréinch squares and the second a

threads themselves. It does not build
other images using the grid as a
foundation, but is ‘a delicate three-
dimensional study and one of the most
striking pieces of the show. ‘

“A grid that is a grid ‘will not escape
being a grid...it is an endless plan, and
endless mystery,” notes Beckley. The
exhibition at the gallery takes advantage
of the solid foundation a grid provides

Performances by all four men were

themselves on ‘recording. I ,
In promoting their new album on this

tour, the spectators (which shouldn’t be a '

reﬂection on Weather Report, as much as
Pittsburgh) were let in at 8:30, which
justs happens to be the title of their latest

- lp. While waiting for the final touches to A

be completed before the show, music to
set the crowd in the right mood was
pumped in over the sound system. This
preparation, for the most part, fell on
deaf ears, and instead of placing
everyone in the mood, it made the Stanley
crowd moody and more anxious for
Weather Report to make their appear-
ance. ,

They weren’t disappointed. A Ray
Charles recording of “America, the
Beautiful” was played as an anthem or
tribute to America’siclassical music, jazz.

Then, with Pastorius, on drums, Zawinul
appeared on stage ambushing ‘with
“8:30.” The duct was hot, fast, and

- brief and got the concert off to a solid

start. Immediately after Erskine took
Pastorious’ place behind the drums, and
Shorter appearedcenter stage, for the
tune “Sightseeing” cooking with hot
be-bop riffs on tenor sax in the tradition

of Miles Davis, his and Zawinul’s mentor. ,

It’s .v-undisputed that,Miles’ overwhelm-

’ ing influence had left its ‘mark’ in the

group,‘ for bothbetter and worse.. Pastor-

 ius for nearly half the concert played with

his back to the audience, which was

typical of Davis in concert when faced A

with criticism of not conforming to
accepted modes of performance. Zawinul
showed these same qualities on stage as
well. On two occasions - leaving his

fortress of keyboards in the middle. of a T.
‘ tune, and walking across the ‘stage while

the "other three musicians were . left
playing in jam session form. He was

visibly upset at the malfunction of his _

equipment, and as conductor, seething
with disgust when Pastorius, Shorter, and
Erskine ignored or missed his direction.

The most evident example of a lacking
rapport within the group was when
Zawinul signalled Erskine with a ﬁerce,
but unacknowledged “cut” sign. Not
once, but twice.

A Erskine is the newest ‘change in 

personnel in over two years and is ‘a
competent addition to the -group. His
control and sense of rhythm held together

~and improved energetic and soulful

compostions like “Birdland,” “The

improvisational numbers that resembled

adequate time to blow this solos during
the hour and 40 minute concert.

Aerosmith/Mother’s Finest
‘ Civic Arena
January 24, 1980

The Boston-based supergroup, Aero-
smith, one of the most popular and
successful hard rock bands of the late
'70s, A is a group at a professional

-- crossroad. ’

Just recently, their crack lead guitarist
and chief musical contributor, Joe Perry,
left the group sighting the reason as
artistic differences. Perry felt his

A presence in Aerosmith was like being part

of a lumbering musical dinosaur and the

band wasdeﬁnitely not movingforward
musically into the 1980s.

“Pretty heavy stuff'from a member of a

. group whose seven albums, including'the

most recent release, “A Night in the

Ruts,” have all gone platinum or double

 V platinum, in addition to a long string of

hugely successful] sellout world tours.
Has Aerosmith been degenerating as
much as Perry has claimed?

Thursday night at the Civic Arena was
the time to see if it was so, in the ﬂesh,
where Aerosmith,with new lead guitarist
Jimmy Crespo, formerly of the New York
group Flame, appeared before a sell-out
crowd of mostly obnoxious teenagers. It
became obvious that these fans felt ‘this
band was ‘still a group of musical gods.

Opening with a grinding version of
“Back in the Saddle,” lead singer Steven
Tyler and company charged through an
hour-and-a-half set of their greatest hits.

Asalways, Aerosmith’s main man was
the Mick Jagger-Carly Simon look-alike
Tyler, who was decked out in his striped,
yellow and ‘red jumpsuit, patented
scarves and mascara. Like Jagger, Tyler
loves to play up- the superstud, sex
‘symbol image, kissing numerous girls in

. _ the front row and letting them touch his
' sweaty hair as he leaned " over and

screamed his [raunchy lyrics packed with
sleazy, sexual overtones. ' '

Tyler, while not possessing the
greatest voice, is a good lyrical
interpreter and a seasoned performer
who knows how to work and control a
crowd without making asinine pleas of

\ gestures “to get up and party.” He
didn't need to. Most of the Arena crowd
was already up on their feet when the

Yﬂllli

group took the stage. , -
With the departure of Perry, Tyler,
more than ever, had to deliver the goods.
He did so, with his best vocal moments
‘coming with “Dream On,” “Walking in
the Sand” andthe two encore songs,
“Come Together” and “Train Kept-A-
Rollin.’ ” His harmonica playing on “Big
Ten lnch (Record),” “Milk Cow Blues”
and “Same Old Song and Dance," was

_ anything but ordinary.

Tyler is 7 unquestionably the man in
Aerosmith who could not be replaced; but

the rest of the band was tight and well
‘rehearsed, and contributed to the no-frills A

show.

Guitarists Brad Whitford and Crespo,
while not the most virtuoso-oriented
musicians in the world, worked well
together, trading the searing ‘and sonic
heavy metal riffs which are the biting kick

in Aerosmith’s simple but hardhitting .

rock style. s

The frail looking, blond-haired Whit-
ford played his traditional role as the
rhythm guitarist but has assumed more of
the lead work with the departure of Perry.

Not a subtle guitarist, most of
is brutal power
chording and thick, wild, almost dissident

leads which jumped out of the speakers '

_ and literally assaulted the senses.

Kramer have always been the rock solid

. FATHERS

Gives You

While not being particularly showy or a
guitar ﬂash, when Whitford stepped into
the lead spotlight on “Lord of the

Thighs,” “Big Ten Inch” and “Same Old‘

Song and Dance,” the crowd took notice.
Crespo is a much smoother and silkier
player than Perry but handled many of
Perry’s best parts on “Walk This Way,”
(Crespo using a guitar-voice box) “Milk
Cow Blues,” “Mama Kin” and “Toys in
the Attic,” quite capably. He’s not as
exciting a stage performer as Perry, but
nevertheless, did not hurt the band.

Kramer, in particular, was extremely
impressive. Although he plays on a
small, black Ludwig drum kit and is short
of stature, he has the robust arms of a
blacksmith and his intensity and concen-
tration throughout the night were
visually, next to the ﬂying antics of Tyler,
the most positive aspect of Aerosmith’s
presentation. '

i If anything could be faulted with
Aerosmith, it would be with their music,
which, as Perry said, is too safe and
unprogressing. Over the last six year, the

whole band has come a long way, as both '

performers and musicians, but they must
get sick and tired of playing simple,
punky music before a mostly teenage
following.

Perry’s disgust with the band and

subsequent departure should be a sign to .

the rest that it’s time to- move onto more

difficult and challenging musical terri-
-tory. ,
The band has the chops to do it and
hopefully the smarts to give it a try.
Opening for Aerosmith was a rather

obscure band from Atlanta called

Mother's Finest.

This is a band who somehow got a
record contract several years ago, has
released numerous forgettable albums
and has been nothing but a warm up act
and will probably stay that way with their
loud, juvenile noise they have the nerve
to call rock music.

‘To discuss what this six-piece heavy
metal-funk band did during their

, 45-minute ‘set would be a _ painful
experience. Just let it be said there are at
least ten bands in this city who know
infinitely more about playing rock music
than Mothef’s Finest. —
