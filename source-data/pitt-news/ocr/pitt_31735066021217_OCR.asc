The party's over  

LCB, local police raid three Pitt fraternity houses

By Erik Kridle
Staff Writer '

Thirty state Liquor Control
Board police accompanied by 10
Pittsburgh police raided three
University of Pittsburgh fraterni-
ty houses at approximately 1:30
early Sunday morning.

According to a state police.

spokesperson, 104 citations were
issued to Pitt students for under-
age drinking at the Delta Tau Del-
ta, Phi Kappa Theta and Sigma

 

Chi fraternities.

There were no altercations and
no one was arrested or taken to
a police station. Police action in
Saturday's raid was less extreme
than at a similar raid last fall at
Carnegie Mellon University,
when over 300 party-goers were
taken in PAT buses to the police
station downtown.

The citations require the stu-
dents to appear individually be-
fore a state magistrate. If
convicted, they will lose their

drivers licenses for 90 days and
receive $350 fines.

Dennis Donham, vice presi-
dent for Student Affairs, said it
was ’’extremely unfortunate that
something like this had to
happen.

”Of course we are disappoint-
ed that [the fraternities] had this
kind of party and served drinks to
minors,” he said.

I Donham emphasized that the
LCB _was_ ’’only doing its job”
when it raided the houses.

However, Donham’ said, he
would have liked the LCB to have
contacted university officials be-
fore it carried out its plans to raid

I the fraternities.

”We should all cooperate with
the LCB, and to the praise of the
students involved, they did just
that,” he said. «

. Donham said the Office of Stu-
dent Affairs would not ”turn its
back” on the violations of the
fraternities involved.

”We don't have a sanctuary on

One eyewitness said- police
blocked off the entrances of the
three fraternity’ houses simultane-
ously. Those with proper l.D.

were told to show it to the officers -

at the doors and then leave the
buildings. Those remaining
without proper I.D. were issued
citations for underage ‘drinking.

Dr. Conney M. Kimbo,
McKeesport. native and vice
president of student affairs at
the University of Pittsburgh for
the past 10 years, died of
cancer at Presbyterian-
University Hospital on April
13. He was 56 years old.

Kimbo‘ was responsible for
many of the changes .over the
past decade that now define
the personality of Pitt- S «

Pitt President Wesley Posvar
said of Kimbo, ”| recruited
him myself, and I can say that
it is one of the most success-
ful decisions I've ever made.”

According to Posvar, he met
Kimbo while on a trip to St.
Louis. Kimbo was then dean of
student affairs at the Universi-
ty of Missouri at St. Louis. Pos-
var said he was ’’immediately
impressed with his Compe-
tence and inner strength.”

Along with admiring his
professional character, Posvar

added, ”He was just a very
nice guy. A person that every-
one intuitively liked.”
Dennis Donham, assistant
vice president for student af-
fairs has known Kimbo for the
past 20 years. The two met in
1968 at C-rinnell College.
Donham was assistant dean
for student affairs, and Kimbo
was=an assistant professor and
wrestling and football coach.
Donham said, ”We hit it off.
well fromthe very beginning.

. We ‘became . ‘instant friends.

Student Affairs Vice President Kimbo dies at 56

. We had a lot of common goals
and interests.” .

In 1969, Kimbo was
promoted. to associate dean.‘
He was appointed dean of the
student affairs the following
year and remained at‘C.rinnell
until 1973, when he joined
the University of Missouri at
St. Louis.

Donham did not meet him
again until May of 1980 when ~
Donham came to Pitt.

S_ecurity E-hanges called for after disaster

SHEFFIELD, England (AP) -
Lawmakers Sunday demanded
changes in stadium designs, in-
cluding a ban on anti-riot fences,
after a mad rush at a soccer match
trapped thousands of fans behind
one of the steel barriers. At least
94 people died.

Prime Minister Margaret
Thatcher visited Hillsborough
stadium and promised a public
inquiry into Saturday's disaster,
which turned a soccer cup semi-
final between Liverpool and Not-
tingham Forest into a nightmare.

The investigation was expected
to focus on why so many fans
were still outside as the match be-
gan and on allegations that many
entered the sold-out stadium,
which has a capacity of 54,000,
without tickets or with forged
tickets.

In Liverpool, the Roman
Catholic cathedral was filled to

NEWS BRIEFS

overflowing for a Requiem Mass
for the victims — most of them
from the northwest port city. The

' Anglican Cathedral's bell tolled

94 times to mark the deaths.

Survivors broke down in tears
as they described watching chil-
dren die and people hit each
other in the frenzied fight to sur-
vive Britain's worst sports
disaster.

Academy of music
reopens after repairs

PHILADELPHIA (AP) -— After
two weeks of structural inspec-
tions and repairs that forced its
closing, Philadelphia's 132-year-
old Academy of Music reopened

Sunday with a concert by Peter
Nero and the Philly Pops or-
chestra.

The 132-year-old concert hall
was closed on March 31 after
structural engineers found cracks
in wooden ceiling trusses that
support the roof. The Philadel-
phia Orchestra Association,
which owns and operates the
Academy, closed it under advice
from engineers.

John Schmidt, assistant
manager‘ of the Academy, said
the hall opened on time for the
3 p.m. performance of the Philly
Pops.

Titanic survivor says
show the artifacts

PHILADELPHIA (AP) — One of
the few remaining survivors of

"the Titanic said at a memorial

service for the maritime disaster
that she doesn't mind the display
of artifacts from the sunken ocean
liner.

But Louise Pope also believes

the rest of the huge ship should .

be left alone at the bottom of the
Atlantic Ocean.

Mrs. Pope, who was 4 years
old when the steamer struck an

iceberg in the North Atlantic and A_

sank in the morning hours of
April 15, 1912, sat quietly with
her hands folded at the Seamen’s

Church Institute Saturday while’

the Rev. Neale Secor blessed a
wreath.

Secor asked that mercy be
granted ”to those who went
down to the fathoms on the‘Titan—
ic and those who have since
joined them.”

Downtown: destination 
of human rights ralliers

By Erik Kridle
Staff Writer

An estimated - 600 people
gathered in Market Square Satur-
day amid Downtown high-rises
to protest the ”economic in-
justice” which they believe exists
in America today.

Four separate groups of
demonstrators from the South
Side, North Side, the Hill District
and‘ Oakland marched to the
downtown ral_ly, the purpose be-
ing several-fold according to or-
ganizers.

”Pittsburgh cares about the
people who are poor, hungry and
homeless,” the Rev. Terry
Provance, rally coordinator, said
to the crowd. ”Pittsburgh” cares
too about people who work to
support a family at a job that pays
the minimum wage.”

Provance called for the federal I

government to be ”more respon-
sive” to the needs of the poor,
homeless and hungry people by

reducing the defense budget and ~

increasing the minimym wage

from $3.70 to $4.65 per hour.
”Pittsburgh fights until Pitts-

burgh wins!” Provance shouted.
Provance contended that there

V is an ever-widening financial gap
between America's rich and poor
citizens, adding, ”We will not

stop until the economic gap is
closed.”

Rally speakers included
Patricia Clowney from Allegheny
County Action Housing;
Rosemary Trump, local president
of the Service Employees Union;
and Doug Heuck, a Pittsburgh
Press writer who spent two weeks
last summer living on the streets
of Pittsburgh among the homeless
which culminated in a six-part
series about his experiences. '

The poor state of the environ-
ment was another topic of con-
cern at the rally. Comedian and
political activist Dick Gregory
spoke about the Valdez, Alaska
oil spill and the need for the fed-
eral government to make a strong
commitment to environmental
preservation.

’’If it had been welfare mothers

-who had polluted the water up
there in Alaska, they would be on
their way to jail by now,” he said.

_G_regory claimed that 90 per-
cent of therdeaths in the United
States last year were directly relat-
ed to the pollution of our air, '

would call insanity,” Ferlo said in
reference to the national defense

"budget and what he called ”the

warmongers in Washington.”
”We need to have a national
budget that reflects the needs of
the city of Pittsburgh,” he added.
According to Ferlo, Pittsburgh's
City Council declared Saturday as
April 15th Day and urged all
Pittsburgh residents to participate
in the march. K
Most of the crowd that
gathered at Pitt consisted of stu-
dents from a variety of university
organizations. One marcher,
Steve Shussett, said that he was
not a member of any of the
groups present but was involved
in forming the Student Coalition.
According to Shussett, the coa-
lition would consist of groups at
Pitt who have progressive views,
such as the Student Action Un-
ion, The New Student Network,
the Central American Peace Coa-
lition, the Urban Studies Associ-
ation and the Student Executive
Council. All of these groups were
represented at the rally.
”We’re all trying to link

Shussett said.

the CAPC, said that she was at the
march because she thought that
the United States government
needs to spend tax money more
wisely.

”We, as a nat-ion, need to
spend money on things such as
feeding the hungry and housing
the homeless, [and] not fund low-
level conflicts in places such as
El Salvador,” she said.

Mike Antonnucci, the president
of Pitt's U.S.A., said that members
of his group were present be-
cause they wanted to get in-
volved in the community and get

hands-on experience outside the

classroom.

The president of the S.E.C., Bill
Page, sees the formation of the
Student Coalition as an important
step for future demonstrations.

”Hopefully in the future, the
Student Coalition will be able to
overcome the image Pitt has as an
apathetic campus,” Page said.

With that, Page and the other

protesters began their march "

downtown to rendezvous with

other groups from around Pitts-’

burgh who supported " their
causes.

Well, it could have
been much worse...

This weekend, the Liquor Control Board struck —
three fraternities were raided, and over 100 citations
were handed out for underage drinking. This total was
mostly comprised of Phi Kappa Theta party—goers, who
accounted for nearly 75 of the busts. The lowest num-
ber of citations given at any of the three was 12.

For a college campus, on a Saturday night, that isn't
bad.

When the new officers for the Interfraternity Council
were sworn in this year, President Jim Venturella said
that one of the important problems that the council
would be addressing would be curbing underage drink-
ing. While the Phi Kappa Theta total seems inordinate-
ly high, it nevertheless appears that some progress has
been made.

Underage drinking is, of course, one of the most com-
mon college pastimes. While it is against the law, one
would be hard pressed to find an under-21 college stu-
dent who has not gotten his hands on some liquor at
some point. As a problem, it is here to stay.

Venturella said that the emphasis for this year would
be on responsible drinking, and it seems to have
worked. The fraternities have come to terms with the
Oakland community, and Saturday's raids were not a
repeat of the fiasco last year at Carnegie Mellon. Be-
cause the perpetrators were peaceful and non-
disruptive, citations were issued instead of arrests be-
ing made.

The fraternities also had heard rumors that the LCB
would be in town this weekend, and at least one frater-
nity responded by canceling a party that had been
scheduled, thus preventing any further problems with
the board.

While underage drinking is a crime, and certainly not
to be encouraged, it is also a fact of life at a university.
The fraternities should be commended for trying to con-
trol the underage drinking situation. Pretending that it
doesn't happen is not a solution. Outreach programs
such as Our Choice, sponsored by the IFC, help to
minimize some of the effects of underage drinking and
to educate students about the dangers of alcohol abuse.
By encouraging responsible drinking habits, it is doing
the "best that it can with a difficult situation.

How to win the America's Cup?

A federal -judge recently ruled
that the United States could not
keep the America's Cup. The
judge stated that by using a
catamaran, the San Diego Yacht
Club had raced unfairly against
New Zealand, and many world-
class American yachtsmen, in-
cluding myself, went into mourn-
ing. It seemed unfair to lose the

ART
BUCHWALD

trophy just because we had dis-
covered a new way to dunk the

_ chaps down under. What to do?

An emergency meeting of the
Vineyard Haven Yacht Club was
called. In the past, the VHYC had
left it to the New York Yacht Club
or the San Diego Yacht Club to
do the racing — but now it
looked as if it was time for others
to save the day for the United
States.

Stern proposed, ”I think that
we should hire the captain of the
Exxon oil tanker in Alaska as the
skipper.”

Brown seconded his proposal,
”|'ll drink to that.”

Clurman rose to object. ”How
doyou know we can get him?
He's the hottest sailor on the
West Coast.”

Stern answered, ”We will ap-
peal to him on navigational
grounds. We'll tell him that he's
not going out there to win the
cup back from the New
Zealanders. He's also going to

Animal research is mere cruelty?

Although I believe in education
as the major tool for social
change, I sympathize with the
frustration of groups that ”|iber-
ate” laboratory animals and des-
troy equipment there. They see
that laws sometimes protect cer-
tain powerful vested interests
(e.g., the grant-hungry research
community) rather than what is
actually right. They consider that
the crime is in creating instru-
ments of torture, not in destroy-
ing them, and that research
resources are being wasted in
cruel irrelevancies.

Lou Grieco [April 6, ”Animal
rights can only go so far"] con-
demns them because he assumes
that animal experimentation is a
necessary evil, yielding great
benefits to mankind. However,
the vast bulk of. such research is

”We can't begin because we
don't have a hull,’’ Guggenheim
added.

’’It doesn't matter," Stern re-
plied, ”He’|l never know.”

Van Ripper was not so sure.

. ”Doesn’t the man have a drink-

ing problem?” _

”Everybody who goes to sea
has a drinking problem. That's
why they have an automatic pi-
lot,” Wallace assured us.

I told the group,. ”My only con-
cern is that he doesn't hit a reef.”

Stern sounded surprised, ”How
can he hit a reef? The channel is
10 miles wide. I'd trust my life to
an Exxon skipper on the open
sea.” _ R

”Do we have any other
choices?” Styron wanted to
know. i

”No one in the same class as
Hazelwood,” Durr answered.
”He’s a household name."

”|’|l drink to that,” Eaton
yelled. ”How do we get him?”

Stern spoke up, ”He's holding
out now because everyone is try-
ing to sign him up. I think we
have the inside track if we appeal

to his patriotism and send a case

of'champagne.”

Guggenheim sounded worried,
”I just hope that none of the other
yacht clubs gets to him first.”

ron explained. ‘ ’ ‘

Stern was anxiousto finish our
meeting, ”If there are no objec-
tions, we agree to hire Captain
Hazelwood to skipper the next
race and to bring back the Ameri-
ca’s Cup to the shores of the great
land.’’ ' ~

This is the story of Kenny the
Cockroach.

Chapter one unfolded five
weeks ago when a hallmate, who
wanted to check on the floor's
hot water valve, saw something
long, orange and angry. He had
to force himself to remember that
he was not in the Tower's
cafeteria.

”Holy smokers,” Tim thought,
”what a huge cockroach!”

”Caramba!” Alberto echoed,
”Que cucaracha mas grande!”

It wasn't that much later that
the floor took up arms. Quickly,
the resident assistant distributed
of Raid), and words of en-
couragement. . ,-

”Men, these are the times that
separate the men from the boys.
Our floor has been invaded by
the order Blattaria,” our biology-
major leader informed us. ’’I
don't have the right to force you
into battle, so anyone who does
not wish to engage in insect war
should leave now.”

plished, we can now take a wan-
dering tour through my mind,
noting the many unfinished
topics that never made it to
print...

With the recent hubbub going
on about the student activities
fee, this seems like a good time
to say something about it. Con-
sidering the several thousand dol-
lars a year that the average‘ Pitt
student pays to have his diploma
mailed to him after he graduates,
32 bucks a year isn't much to

complain about. For most stu-
dents, that's an‘ extra couple of
trips to Zelda's or the 0.

There may be some complain-
ing about why students shouldn't
just pay membership fees direct-
ly to the clubs they join, instead
of subsidizing every organization
with a dollar or two, but this is ac-
tually silly. Very few people here
probably have the foresight to

fairly large percentage of you
have been forced to read my
book, Ways of Seeing, in vari-

And I know for a fact that
some of you are even now read-

Newsweek complimented me
on that epic, saying, ”Perhaps
most astute of all is Berger's ex-
planation of how Don Juans _
succeed.”

OK, OK, so maybe I'm not
that John Berger. I have no idea
how Don Juans succeed. In fact,
that's one of the great questions
looming in my life right now.
I'm strongly considering reading
C. myself, so that I can find out
how they succeed. God knows,
I need all of the help I can get.

As far as Ways of Seeing, I do
pride myself on having a few of
those. I write poetry. And for

For a while after that, nothing
happened, and everyone thought
that Kenny had moved to CMU,
or perhaps even Duquesne.

Without the activities fee there
wouldn't be the dollar movies at

rather pay $4.50 for a ticket?
Another thing I've got to
wonder about is the nation's drug

this title come from? A drug czar

mate said, ”when suddenly the
shower curtain flew open and in
walked Kenny the Cockroach.
God, he was huge. Before I knew
what was happening, I was
kicked out of the shower, had my
towel thrown at my face and had
to stand, sopping wet, as Kenny
commandeered not only my
shower stall but my shampoo as
well. I felt so used."

Some of my floor, however, is
not so opposed to the floor cock-
roach. ”Kenny’s my buddy,” Adil
Desai said enthusiastically. ”He
doesn't bother me, and I won't
bother him. But if he does...
WHAM!"

It was not until recently that I
finally met the floor's only true
personality. I figured that this was
my chance for a unique conver-
sation. Grabbing a notepad and
a pen, I interviewed the creature.

. The following are excerpts from

the interview:

Kenny, eight months old, is a
widower, father of 3,000 and
now Tower C's most eligible

charge of manufacturing and dis-
tributing drugs, not stomping
them out. Kind of makes you
think the government isn't taking
this problem as seriously as it
should. ‘

What about the Pittsburgh

police? In the wake of the Grate- ’

ful Dead concert, people have fi-
nally realized that the city police

didn't need the Dead to come to

would've been good enough.
Many are the times I've been
brusquelyoffered free trips down-

- town by a police officer who

didn't like me watching him club
someone with his nightstick.
Which brings me to my'next
topic (well, not exactly). Under-
age drinking has long been a
norm.of college life. A week of
economics, calculus and anthro-—
pology is enough to drive anyone

to drink, but if you're under 21,

Kenny's hobbies include pro-
creating, eating spoiled food and
modeling. His favorite book is
Kafka’s The Metamorphosis, and
the last good movie he saw was
A Cockroach Orange. Idols in-
clude Jiminy Cricket, the VW
Beetle and Mr. Peabody and

Kenny lobbies for a more spoiled
environment.

There are some members of the
floor who deny Kenny's exis-
tence. ”l’ve never seen Kenny the
Cockroach in my life,” seniorloe
Niedt said.

One pleasant thing about the
infestation of our floor is that it
has brought us closer together. A
”buddy-system” has been initiat-
ed. No longer do we walk solo
to the drinking fountain or the
bathroom.

Unfortunately, the "buddy-

Perhaps the worst thing about-

writer's block is that the minute
you tell someone you’ re suffering
from a case, he proceeds to tell
you all the wonderful things you
could be writing about, such as
this gem: industrial melanism.

Industrialmelanism illustrates
perfectly the evolutionary chain
that dominates life. Back before
the industrial revolution (keep
reading, this’ll get better) there
were two different kinds of a cer-
tain moth — the light ones and
the dark ones. The moths used to
hide on the trees to keep from
getting eaten by birds, and the
light ones always blended in bet-
ter with the bark, so the dark ones
were easy targets on the ala carte
line.

and polluted the air, the soot col-
lected on the trees, making it eas-
ier for the dark ones to hide,_and
putting the light ones on the

birds’ menus. Now there are.

hardly any light-colored moths

valid as a column, a letter, or an

should be 250 words or less,
poems should not be longer
than about 25 lines, and art-
work should be line drawings in

reduceable. More freedom in

Last week, one of our brethren
was looking down the shaft
where the water pipes are locat-
ed. Remember, this is the origi-
nal sighting spot of Kenny.
Suddenly, the hall was rocked by
a squeal and a scream. We all
raced to the source, only to see
the poor schlep from 406 being
dragged down the shaft. No one
has slept soundly since. ‘ '

Enough was enough, I thought,
so I went to the Housing Office
to complain. The people there
told me that everything was taken
care of and that Kenny would no
longer aimlessly patrol the hall-
way. As of next year,‘Kenny the

THE PITT NEWS

Baseball team humbled b

By Vince Carey
Sports Editor

Overheard after Pitt lost to Se-
ton Hall 11—3 yesterday, ”lt was
a perfect day for a baseball game,
too bad Pitt saw it fit not to play
any.”

”The difference was between
their maturity and our inex-
perience,” Pitt coach Larry Way-
man said. ”We threw freshman at
them, we had a few injuries and
had to shuffle the lineup. They
made the big hits on us and we
didn't. We had the bases loaded
several times and couldn't get the
hits. That was the difference in
the game.”

For the record, the Panthers
loaded the basepaths in the
fourth, fifth, eighth and ninth in-
nings and could only muster
three runs.

The Panthers dropped to 5-17
overall and 0-11 in the Big East.
Seton Hall improved to 21-13-1
and 11-1.

It was the second inning that
spelled doom for Pitt. After breez-
ing throught the first, freshman
pitcher Fred _lriti walked Pirate
clean-up hitter Maurice Vaughn.
Shortstop Mike Groppuso
reached on an error and designat-
ed-hitter Phil Aiello knocked in
both runners with a gap double.

It didn't end there, though. Af-
ter the next batter struck out,
catcher Bill Reddick singled in
Aiello. Mike Lamitola grounded

out to first baseman Tim

Gralewski.
With two outs, it looked like Iri-

ti would get out of the inning»

without any further‘ damage.
Pirate outfielder Mike Feoli hit a

long fly right at left fielder Matt’

catcherlon Weaver, thus ending
the nightmare.

All in all, the six runs scored on
just three hits.

”That was a tough inning for
us,” Wayman said. ”Fred made
acouple bad-' pitches,‘ but he'll
learn from this. You just have to
put these things behind you and
look towards the next game.”

”l can't blame the fielding for
the way I did,” lriti said. ’’I had
a lot of close pitches and didn't
get any of them. I fell behind the
batters and couldn't pick it up. It
gets frustrating when you throw
good pitches and don't get the
calls.” ‘
The Panthers relieved Iriti with
freshman Mickey Vincent, but he
didn't fare too well either, giving
up ‘four earned runs in three

Pitt's three runs.

’’It was a tough one today,”
Weaver said. ”There isn't much

P to say about today's game. We

just have to get some pitching.
That's weak right now; we have
a lot of young guys without a lot
of experience.

_ ”Two years down the line, they
are going to be tough. It's just un-
fortunate right now that we have
ateam of seniors and have some

inexperienced pitchers; that's‘

basically what it‘is. I-’m not tak-
ing anything away from them —
we have a bunch of great guys —

Yesterday, Pitt football practice ,

was not what it usually is._

The team didn’t,_practice any
bone-crushing tackles, they didn't

they didn't they sweat through
vigorous conditioning exercises.

It was Special Olympics Day,
and they put their tough football

many special children.

About 80 Special Olympians
from Western Pennsylvania
joined the Panthers for football
practice and participated in vari.-
ous football drills.

started here four years ago. The
day is part of the large commu-
nity service program Gottfried
started.at Pitt. Pitt players and

' coaches also visit sick people at

Children's Hospital and the Vete-
rans Administration Hospital
twice a week.

”Coach Gottfried is a firm be-

tant of Pitt football. ”When he

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, April I7, 1989

The battle for Pennsylvania set in round 2‘

A not—so—famous bookie once
said to me: ”Son, betting on
sports is like choosing your wom-
en. If you go with your heart,
you'll be disappointed. If you go‘
with your head, you'll have a
much better chance of getting
what you want.”

So with that in mind, it's
prediction time for this coming
week as the Penguins and the
Flyers travel between the Igloo
and the Spectrum to determine
the creme de la creme of the
Patrick division.

The key to ‘this entire series will
be, quite simply, aggressive
hockey.

Patience, skill and finesse will
play only a minor role. All this
will occur for one reason — that

less a part of the offense, open-
ing up the scoring to almost
everyone else on the team. Paul
Coffey is using his former playoff
experience to rule the defense
and create his own scoring op-

 

hockey if the Pens continue to
follow their current strategy.

Also, the Penguins had best
start taking advantages of scoring
opportunities anytime they are
presented. Lemieux, Coffey, Jock
Callander, Kevin Stevens and
Rob Brown were all guilty of
blowing easy shots during the
Rangers series.

Instead of putting games away,
the Penguins seem to be content
with a one- or two—goal lead,
scoring only when necessary, and
letting their opponents try to get
back in the game.

And let us not forget exactly
whom the Pens played in the first
round. A team which lost 15 of
its last 18 games, a team whose
coach had recently been fired, a

Philadelphia has the best pow-
er play percentage in the NHL
(26.7), and most of their power
play goals have not been on slap
shots.

There is going to be some seri-
ous hitting going on in the second
round, and the Pens had better be
ready to ‘mix it up.

The Pens have very few play-
ers with any type of playoff ex-
perience, but almost every Flyer
has seen playoff action.

And let us not forget the
tremendous bad luck that the
Pens have in the Spectrum.
Granted, they won twice this

Being a Pittsburgh native and
having seen many a Penguin
game in my 21 years, it is great
to finally be seeing some postsea-
son action.

I like to think that I have
learned a valuable lesson from

ginning of this column.

The Pittsburgh Penguins usual-
ly are battling boredom or their
local golf course this time of the
year, content to watch the NHL
playoffs on TV, another season of

‘ defeat and disappointment be-

hind them.

But when they open the best-
of-seven Patrick Division finals
Monday night against the
Philadelphia Flyers, the Penguins
must contend with an opponent
they've rarely faced in their 22
years of existence: overcon-
fidence.

They haven't played in a
second-round playoff series in 10
years, yet the Penguins — whose
six-year absence from the playoffs
was the longest of any NHL team
— are slightly favored to oust the

—C

cross-state Flyers and advance to
the conference finals.

The Penguins, second-place
finishers in the Patrick Division,
reached a level of play they've
rarely approached in their two
decades of mediocrity when they
manhandled the New York
Rangers in four games. The
Flyers, after finishing fourth in the
regular season, needed only six
games to defeat the first-place
Washington Capitals in their first-
round series. V

Afterwards, some of the Capi-
tals questioned whether the Pen-
guins, who owned a 4-3-1
regular-season edge over
Philadelphia, might enter the ser-
ies too confident.

"Pittsburgh may be rested, but
they may be a little overconfi-
dent," the Capitals’ Rod Langway
said. "The Flyers have to stop just

‘ All stylists excluding? Salvatore

two players in my opinion, Mario
[Lemieux] and [Paul] Coffey. Pitts-
burgh doesn't have the
goaltender to stay with the Flyers,
but they have an offensive-
minded team.” ’

The Penguins don't disagree —
"We're a run-and-shoot team, we
have to score to win,” defense-
man Jim Johnson said — but they
say they still are playing for
respect.

"This team has been down for
so long, we don't know what's
up," Coach Gene Ubriaco said.
''If people want to underestimate
what we did against the Rangers,
let them, because it can only help
our situation. it's been that way
all season. People have constant-
ly reminded us how long we
were out of the playoffs, how
many shots we gave up, how
many goals we gave up."

The series should be physical
and point-minded.

The Penguins, who won their
final two games in Philadelphia
after failing to win there in 14
years, set an NHL power-play
goals record. The Flyers had the
league's best power-play scoring
percentage (26.7 percent);

'’It should be a great series with
the Flyers," Ubriaco said. "They
really seem to be in sync right
now. They've seemed to reach
their level."

''I expect it will be a physical
series,” Flyers defenseman Mark
Howe said. "This team is the
toughest Flyers team I ever
played on. We have six or seven
real quality fighters.

"Both teams have excellent
power plays and both
goaltenders [the Penguins’ Tom
Barrasso and the Flyers’ Ron Hex-
tall] are playing well. It ought to
be a great series.”

Barrasso developed a reputa-

tion in Buffalo for being less—than-

consistent during the playoffs, but
his 2.75 goals—against average vs.
the Rangers is the second lowest
in the playoffs..

Hextall not only jacked up his
playoff performance a notch from
his disappointing regular season,
he became the first goaltender in

{-

NHL history to score a playoff
goal.

While the Flyers are keying on
stopping Lemieux, the NHL’s
scoring leader, and the playoff-
tested Coffey, the Penguins know
they must contain 6-foot-3,
225-pound right wing Tim Kerr,
who scored 25 of his 48 regular-
season goals on the power play.

Kerr has 10, playoff points,
while winger Rick Tocchet
scored seven goals against the
Capitals. -

''It seems all [Kerr] has to do is
get the puck on his stick and it's
in the net,” Johnson said.

As for Lemieux, who has wait-
ed five seasons to experience the
playoffs, the Flyers "have some-
thing up our sleeves for him,”
said center Miké Bullard, a form-
er Penguin.

"You talk about the Pittsburgh
Penguins and you're talking
about two players,” Bullard told

the Pittsburgh Post—Cazette. 1

"What can we do? Break their
legs." ‘

  Can the Pens really be a little overconfident.?'.

lordan sits out fourth
quarter as Cleveland
easily defeats Chicagog

By Chuck Melvi_n
AP Sports Writer V

RICHFIELD, Ohio — Larry
Nance takes little comfort in the
Cleveland Cavaliers’ 5-0 record
against their most likely first-
round playoff opponent, the
Chicago Bulls.

"l'.ve been in playoffs where
that didn't really matter. When I
was with Phoenix, Portland beat

us all year, and we came back

and beat them in the playoffs,”
Nance said Sunday after his 26
points led Cleveland past Chica-
go 111-92. 1
Nance scored 10 of his 26
points during a decisive 12-2 run
at the end of the first half, help-
ing the Cavaliers send the Bulls
to their sixth straight loss.
Cleveland, 56-23, and Chica-

- go, 45-33, would be first-round

opponents if the playoffs began
today. The Bulls beat the
Cavaliers three games to two‘ in
the first round last year.

"We may have to play them in
the playoffs, so we want to finish
the season strong,” said Chica-
go's Michael Jordan, who sat out
the entire fourth quarter because
the game was out of reach. "They
may have a little revenge thing
going here, because we beat
them last year. If we want to do
anything at all in the playoffs, we
need a new attitude."

Nance’s.-26 points were the
most he has scored since he had
27 on March 5 against Milwau-
kee. He has been hampered since
late January by a sore tendon
above his left ankle.

"Something I've got to realize
is that some of the guys might

ample. l've got to be real active, -

they can feed off of that."

Nance had nine rebounds and
two blocked shots.‘

point lead dwindle to one at
43-42 when Jordan scored six
straight points and Charles Davis
hit a short jumper midway
through the second quarter.

‘ Nance, however, stopped the

Chicago run with a 12-foot base- . -

line jumper that started the 12-2
Cleveland flurry, which put the
Cavaliers ahead 55-44 at the half.
Nance scored six of his 10 points
during the spurt on foul shots.

Brad Daugherty then made a
short hook and a free throw
opening the third quarter, and
Cleveland outscored -the «Bulls
35-23 during the period to-put

the game away. Ron Harper ‘

scored 12 of his 21 points in the
quarter, ‘including a fast-break
dunk that gave the Cavaliers a
90-67 lead at the buzzer.

Both coaches rested their start-
ers for most of the fourth quarter.

Jordan led Chicago with 22/53 "

points, and Davis had 15. Daugh-
erty scored 15 for.C|eveland.

Chicago was held scoreless
from the field during the final

3 5:32 of the first half, which closed

Hoffman  

Continued from page 12

Hoffman finds the fielding er-
rors equally as frustrating as
fielders find pitchers who get
blasted all over the field.

”There are a lot of times when
the fielders get on us [pitchers] for
getting "hit around hard,” Hoff-
man said.

”And then when you think
you've got an easy out on a.
grounder or a pop—up, especially
when there are guys on base, a
fielder will make a mistake and
it gets real frustrating.

”But the fielders make mis-
takes, and you make mistakes.
You've just got to expect that and
throw at the next batter harder.”

The Pitt baseball team is cur-
rently 5-I 7 (0-11 in Big East com-
petition). Pittwas totally out of
yesterday's game by the second
inning when the Pirates scored
six runs. ‘ ' '

Hoffman pitched the sixth
throught the ninth innings, basi-
cally when it didn't matter since
Pitt had little chance of coming
back from an eight-run deficit.

Thus, Hoffman considered his
performance -more a personal
victory.

”You just want to come out
and throw your best game,” Hoff-
man said.

”I wanted to go out strong and

show them that I was capable of

shutting them down. When you
go out down by seven or eight
runs, it's definitely easier to pitch
because you're more relaxed.

”I just wanted to do well and
pitch strong for my own good
and my pride.”

Weaver has a unique rapport
with Hoffman that only comes
with experience.

He attributes Hoffman's suc-
cess to experience and his other
pitchers’ lack of success to sim-
ple inexperience.

”Steve is a little more of an ex-

_ perienced pitcher, and he knows

what I'm trying to do behind the
plate and works with me real
good,” Weaver said.

”The young pitchers have a
tendency to get behind in the
count, and become tentative. But
you've got to groove a pitch even
when you're behind in the count,
and that's what the young guys
have to learn to do.”

Hoffman is technically an aca-
demic senior, but still has a year
of athletic eligibility left.

If he is admittedto graduate
school at Pitt, Hoffman will con-
tinue to pitch for the Panthers
next year. If Hoffman leaves next
season, it could prove to be a big
loss fpr the Panthers. I

Fishing Ia ws are sure to anger a few anglers 

ALLENTOWN, Pa. (AP) —
Delaware River shad anglers and
other Pennsylvanians who boat
on the state-line waterway won't
have to worry about being cited
for not having a New Jersey boat-
ing license.

Pennsylvania Attorney Gener-
al Ernest D. Preate Jr. announced
Friday that he has reached an "in-
terim agreement" with New‘ Jer-
sey Attorney General Peter N.
Peretti Jr. "under which New Jer-
sey promises not to cite Pennsyl-
vanians age 17 and up who
operate boats on the Delaware

River without a New Jersey oper-

ators license.”

It will remain illegal for anyone
13 to 16 years old to operate a
boat on Garden State waters, in-
cluding the Delaware, without
having first completed a manda-
tory boating course.

The announcement came after
a New Jersey Marine Police
warning that Pennsylvania boat-
ers who ventured beyond the
midpoint of the river's main
channel would be subject to ar-
rest. New Jersey law requires that
all boat operators in non-tidal
waters hold a boat operator's
license.

The licenses are sold only at
Division of Motor Vehicle offices
across the state for $13.50 — the
payment for four years plus a
$1.50 charge for a photo identifi-
cation card. ,

Some Pennsylvanians already
have secured the permits follow-
ing a declaration by New Jersey
enforcement officers that the
longstanding law would be en-
forced this year. ,

Preate’s letter, dated April 14,
confirms an agreement between
the two attorneys general that
"Pennsylvania-registered boaters

no special provision for boaters
who are not residents of New

Jersey.

On the Delaware River, tidal -

waters are generally considered
to be the sector south of Trenton.

‘ "The state line is determined as
the geographical middle of the

main channel,” Momm said.’

"That's not necessarily the mid-
dle of the river." .

The issue has upset and con-
fused Pennsylvanians who travel
to the river at this time of the year
to fish for shad.

Preate’s intervention came at
the request of the Pennsylvania
Fish Commission, which is
responsible for setting and enforc-
ing the state's boating laws. ,

"We contacted the attorney
general's office about two weeks
ago seeking assistance in solving
the problem,” said Dave Wolf, a
public information agent in the
commission's Harrisburg office.

"We had over 1,000 calls on
the issue,” said Wolf. "Some
people reported that they were is-
sued warnings on the lower Dela-
ware and there are rumors of
some arrests.”

Wolf said PFC Executive Direc-
tor Edward Miller was notified at
noon Friday that an agreement
with New Jersey had been
reached.

The interim pact,.according to
Preate‘, will be followed by
negotiations "on behalf of the
Pennsylvania Fish Commission to
reach a final resolution of this
issue.” ‘

said Sunday that Dispersal will
leave Thursday for either Louis-

If Dispersal goes to Louisville,

he would start in -the one-mile

Derby Trial pn opening day April

.29 at Churchill Downs. Then a

decision would be made about
starting in the Derby the follow-
ing Saturday. .

' "lf he goes in the Derby Trial,

, it would give him a feel of the

track and we'd see how he per-
forms there,” Delp said.

''I know he can go the mile and
a quarter [of the Derby]," said
Randy ‘ Romero, who rode
Western Playboy for the firsttime

. Saturday.

'’I ain't saying nothing against

Easy Goer because he's a beauti- I

ful animal. They're both good
animals. I just want to ride my
race and just hope I get the job
done." ‘

1 Romero rod Western Playboy
in the upper stretch and again
with a little more than an eighth-
mile remaining.

"-[The first bump] turned him
sideways a little bit and sl_owed
his momentum," Romero said.
"He's so big,-he overcame that
really well.“ I got him back
together again, and he went on
and won easy."

Western Playboy ran the dis-

tance in 1:51 1-5 under level

weight of 121 pounds. He paid
a winning mutual of $4 and
earned $185,900 from a purse of

good time. It's great seeing them
all smiling.”

Kramer said a day like this is as
good an experience for the play-
ers as it is for the children.

”Our players benefit from this
as much as the Special Olympi-
ans,” said Kramer. ”They get a
good feeling from helping peo-
ple. It's not easy to see sick chil-

l

dren and parents of children who
are sick.

”The players also come away
with the idea as to what real
toughness is. When you see a
youngster with cancer or in a
body cast, and that person is smil-
ing, it shows them what it is to be
tough. it puts it all in per-
spective.”
