Pittsburgh, Pa., Monday, March 30, I936

We believe anything now
that they’ve scheduled Pitt’s
Military Ball for the Tech
campus. But we must admit

they have a great hall there.

will speak on “Some Results of a Study

The topic is based on the results of
an investigation Dr. McFadden has
been cgrrying on in his classes.

Antique Furnishings Moved
To New Cathedral Library

 

After being hidden away in State
Hall for almost ﬁfteen years, the
Darlington Library furnishings will
be used as the central furniture of the
Darlington Memorial Library, sched-
uled to be opened in May on the sixth
ﬂoor of the Cathedral.

The old furniture was built about
seventy-ﬁve years ago for the Darling-
ton family collection. When the
estate was settled, the library and
the furnishings were given to the Uni-
versity. Up until last year, they had
been used to store the books at the
University library in State Hall.

Much of the carved ornamentation
was stripped from the cases to mod-
ernize them. They have been com.
pletely torn down, repaired, and
renovated at the University carpen-
try shop. All the original varnish and
stain has been removed and a new
surface given to the furniture. All
of the furnishings are of solid walnut,
which authorities say could hardly
be duplicated today at any cost. At
the present time, the cases are being
stored and reﬁnished in the repair’ de-
partment in the Cathedral.

The largest of the group is a 12-foot
bookcase, which will cover an entire
wall of one of the eight rooms in the

Bureau‘ office, Room 1117, Cathedral.

RETAIL BUREAU CLASS
ENROLLS NINE STUDENTS

Applications Available To Seniors
Interested’ In Store Work

Nine students have already been ac-
cepted into the University Bureau of
Retail Training for next semester, ac-
cording to a report issued today by the
Bureau. Although in former years the
department has limited its class to
eight or nine students, this year the
quota has been raised to 15, due to the
increased facilities and faculty of the
Bureau. Names of accepted students
will not be released until the entire
class is chosen. ,

Organized by the Bureau to give ex-
tensive training in retail and merchan-
dise methods to a small group of grad-
uate students, the classes include cour-
ses in store operation, advertising, per-
sonnel work, salesmanship, and other
phases of department store manage-
ment.

Courses are conducted by the regu-
lar faculty of the department, and ad-
ditional lectures are conducted by out-
standing merchandise and personnel
authorities; Classroom training is sup-
plemented by periods of practical work
and observation in downtown depart-
ment stores.

Applications may still be ﬁled in the

"Admission requirements include a
bachelor’s degree from a recognized
university, although in special cases
students may complete their senior
year at the University by taking the
Bureau course. A personal interview
with members of the Bureau staff, and
two months of actual selling experience
immediately before entering the bureau
in the fall are also required.

Brandon, Eichelberger Plan
To Debate Allegheny College

Albert Brandon, C36, and James
Eichelberger, C38, will take the affir-
mative of the Supreme Court question
against Allegheny College tomorrow
afternoon at Norwin High School, Ir-
win, Pa.

At Alumni Hall on Wednesday night
Milton Lehman, C39, and Norman
Davis, C39, will take the affirmative of
socialized medicine, and Herman Fore-
man, C37, and Edward Springer, C39,

a debate with two teams from St. Vin-
cent Preparatory School.

memorial. The case has six divisions,
each with a separate long glazed door.
Below each door is a small cup-
board and a large drawer. Originally
there were ﬁve shelves in each
division, but this arrangement will
probably be changed when the furni-
ture is installed.

Another large case is divided into
ﬁve divisions, each with a separate
door with a rounded top. The edges
of the case are in the form of long
ﬂuted columns. Originally there were
six trays in each part. The base is
similar to that of the larger case.

One of the most unusual pieces of
the collection is the secretary, a mas-
sive chiffoniér-like affair. The panelled
desk shelf folds up almost to the top.
Each of the large lower three draw-
ers are panelled. Near the ﬂat top
of the secretary is a small door.

Included in the group are two
identical cases, each having two large
center doors with two small end
doors, giving a pyramided effect. In
the original design, there were six
shelves in the large divisions and ﬂve
in the smaller. Below each of the
divisions are spacious storage closets.
The edges of each case are "inlaid.

97 STUDENTS RETURN
NOMINATION PETITIONS
TO SFA EXECUTIVE BODY

April 1 Set As New Deadline Date
For Men’ s Council Petitions
Due To Signature Ruling

As the deadline for petitions for
nomination to Student-Faculty Asso-
ciation ended at 5:30 o’clock \Vednes-
day, 97 men and women had placed
their names in the running.

Petitions for the newl_v—formed Men's
Council, which were due at the same
time. may be turned in until 5 o’clock,
April 1, according to Theodore W’.
Biddle, assistant to the dean of men.
This extension of time was made be-
cause of a ruling that Men's Council
petitioners must have only inen’s sig-
natures.

The number of petitions does not
measure up to that of last year, when
184 undergraduates applied. The SFA
Executive Committee, following the
successful procedure inaugurated last
year, will pare down the 97 to the linii—
ted 60 who will run for the 20 men’s
ofﬁces and ten women’s positions open
in SFA.

From the present sophomore class,
60 have petitioned, comparing with the
45 men and 25 women who entered
last year. Twenty men and 17 women
from the junior class are in the race
for senior seats, as against 95 men and
19 women, last year’s number.

Altogether, 32 men have entered
nomination petitions so far for the 13
seats in the newly-formed Men’s Coun-
cil, divided into 14 juniors, 6 sopho-
mores, and 12 freshmen.

The elections to SFA and Men’s
Council will be held on Friday, Ap-
ril 17.

All except one of the 15 present jun-
ior members of the Assembly signiﬁed
their desire to be considered for nomi-
nation. Marcella Leyton, C, does not
choose to run. The others include Lois

FATHER ROSS TO SPEAK
on RELIGIOUS LIBERTY

Inquiry To Hear Catholic Writer
At Wednesday Noon Meeting

“Religious Liberty” will be the topic
at the regular session of Inquiry Forum
VVednesday, according to an announce-
ment today by Katherine Monori, C36,
co-chairman of the Forum.

Rev. J. Elliot Ross, Catholic lecturer
and writer, will be the speaker. Father
Ross is a graduate of Loyola C_ollege,
George _Washington University, and
Catholic University. He has been chap-
lain to Catholic students at several
large universities, lecturer, priest at sev-
eral churches, and a member of the
faculty of a number of schools, one of
which was Teachers College, Colum-
bia.

Keenly interested in subjects with
s_oc.ial implications, Father Ross has
written a number of books on ethics
and the wage problem. The best
known of these books are “Consumers
And" Wage Earners,” “The Right To
Work,” and “Sanctity And Social
Service.”

This will not be the first time that
Father Ross has appeared on the cam-
pus. Last week he spoke before a
YWCA group in Heinz House. He
also spoke before the weekly luncheon
meeting of the Hungry Club on the
same subject which he will use at In-
quiry Forum.

The meeting of Inquiry Forum will
be held as usual in Room 107, Alumni
Hall, apd all interested students are
invited to attend. The time is 12:30
o’clock.

I MILITARY BALL GOES

You Helped Her Once, Help Her Again

(See editorial, “Bread For Louise,” on page two)

The nickel you gave in exchange for your copy of The News
today, combined with the nickels contributed by other campus folks,
will make a sum large enough to be of much value to ﬂood sufferers

whose plight corresponds to that

of the little girl pictured above.

VVednesday’s issue of The News also will be sold to bolster the sum
of the contribution. Every cent goes to the Red Cross.

TO TECH ON APRIL 22

Same National Orchestras May
Play Postponed Affair

Ready—-Aim—Listen: The 1936 Mili-
tary Ball will be held \/Vednesday eve-
ning, April 22, in the Gymnasium and
Thistle Hall of Carnegie Tech, accord-
ing to an announcement by Howard
Lutz, BA36, chairman of the affair, on
Friday afternoon.

If dates can be arranged, the same
two national orchestras, Harold Stern
and Hot-Cha Gardner, will provide the
music. Deﬁnite information as to bands
will be announced by next Friday.

This new setting for the dance will

relieve the crowded conditions, which
drew so many complaints at Military
Balls in former years, since the floor
space in Tech’s Gym and Thistle Hall
will be at least one-third larger than
the combined ﬂoor space of the four"
rooms on the 17th ﬂoor of the \Vi1liam
Penn. - v -
“If students, having already pur-
chased tickets, for any reason wish to
obtain a cash refund, they may do so
by presenting their tickets at the Mili-
tary Ofﬁce, ‘Room 1101“, Cathedral, any-
time after 2:30 o’clock, Friday, April
3,” advised Lutz.

Flooded conditions in the downtown
area caused postponement of the Ball
from its original date of March 20.

The new policy allows for the par-
ticipation of seniors who have not as
yet been included on the committee.
Ebert “hopes that the entire Senior

event of the class of 1936 and make it
a real ﬁnale.” .

All committee members will assem-
ble again Friday for The Owl picture,
originally scheduled for last Friday.
Thepicture will deﬁnitely be taken in
Room 1101, Cathedral, at 2:10 o’clock,

NEWS GOES ON SALE
TODAY TO RAISE FUND
FOR FLOOD SUFFERERS

University Students And Faculty
Asked to Aid Contributions
With 5—Cent Donations

One nickel from each University
student and member of the faculty is
the goal set today by The Pitt News
in its campaign to raise a campus con-
tribution to aid the Red Cross in com-
bating the destruction and damage
caused by Pittsburgh's worst flood.

The same arrangement, that of sell-
mg each copy of the paper for ﬁve
cents, will be continued \Vednesday.

l\I.embers of the business staﬁ' of The
News will be stationed in each campus
building at the regular paper distribu-
tion locations to receive the money. In
addition, members of the editorial staff
will serve as free-lance salesmen, con-
tacting‘ students in the classrooms and
halls.

Available In 801, Cathedral

A large stack of the papers in the
office of the dean of i_ncn will contin-
ually be replenished, so that there may
be one deﬁnite supply available all day
until 5 o’clock.

Every contribution received will be
turned over to the Red Cross, now con-
ducting‘ a drive to collect three million
dollars for relief purposes here and in
other communities hit hard by the Hood
waters. All expenses entailed in the
campus campaign will be borne by The
News.

\Vhile ﬁve cents is but a small sum
of money, The News has established
that ﬁgure as the standard contribution
so that everyone may be able to take
part in and assume an equal share of
the campus contribution.

“If you’re reading this over some-
body else’s shoulder,” advises The
News, “go right up and get yourself
a paper. Also don’t forget to get an-
other one Wednesday.”

Delegation Completes Plans
For Government Conference

VVith less than a month to go until
the third annual meeting of the Inter-
collegiate Conference on Government
at Harrisburg, April 24 to 26, the Uni-
versity delegation is rapidly complet-
ing its ﬁnal preparations.

According to William Stark, C38,
chairman of the group, meetings will
be held every Sunday afternoon, at
2:30 o’clock, at 384 South Highland
Avenue. Students interested in work-
ing with the group are invited to attend.

To date, the group has drawn up ten-
tative plans which will be presented
and discussed at Harrisburg. The fol-
lowing are several proposed: Direct
election bf president and vice president;
constitutional amendment making the
amending process less cumbersome;
abolition of the powers of the Supreme
Court to pass on constitutionality of
Congressional statutes; and the elimi-
nation of judicial interference with ad-
ministrative affairs.

The proposed plank covering public
utilities includes government ownership
of public utilities by compensation of
present owners after due study by in-
dependent commissions established for
that purpose; public utilities to include
transportation, water, oil, gas, electric

power, communications, banks, etc.

The proposed foreign relations plank
includes: tariff revision by international
treaty; cooperation with World Court,
League of Nations, trying to effect
promotion of international peace; neu-
trality measures leading to government
ownership of munitions plants engaged
in peace-time production of war ma-
terials; and prohibition of loans to all
belligerents.

Under social security proposals, the
group suggests a complete system of
social insurance, covering unemploy-
ment, old age, health, and accidents;
establishment of national employment
agencies, and the abolition of private
agencies; stricterlabor laws governing
woman and child labor; and the exten-
sion of farmer and labor cooperatives.

The labor relations plank includes:
exemption of trade unions from anti-
trust laws; exclusion of convict labor
products from interstate commerce;
and a greater extension of collective
bargaining free from coercion; estab-
lishment of Federal Labor Relations
Court; and the fostering of the forma-
tion of an international labor office
with a comprehensive educational pro-
gram.

Bread For Louise

I-IAT’S LOUISE, the little girl you see pic-

tured amid loaves of bread on the ﬁrst page.

Louise is out with a basket because some
mighty ﬂood waters came and the damage they
caused made it tough for her to get bread.

Of course Louise didn’t have a whole lot before
those waters came. She may have had bread enough,
a coat warm enough, and perhaps even a rag doll
and a set of jacks, but much of this is gone. And
long after the ﬂood-ravaged large business houses
are restored and the disaster becomes only a mem-
ory, Louise will keep on getting hungry and being
chilled by the cold and the damp.

Louise may be taken ill, and someone must care
for her. She may become thin and weak, someone
must keep her strong. Louise’s dad and mother will
be hard put to restore the family’s prospect to what-
ever plane it had before the ﬂood; this means that
help for Louise must come from the outside.

There are hundreds of little Louises. There are
more hundreds of big Louises. And there are hun-
dreds of big and little Lewises and Eddies and Jacks,
all of whom need the aid of an assisting hand.

Maybe we’ll never see little Louise. Maybe she’ll
never know we're giving nickels to help her. But
those who give them will know, they will realize
something of what it is to give aid “unto one of the
least of these.”

Let’s all help to keep little Louise’s basket full.

What Others Say

Why Libraries Go Wrong

\Ve chide gently those students who use the library for
duties which can be performed elsewhere. A survey by
Alvin Eurich, assistant professor of educational psychol-
ogy, shows that only one-third of the students in the
library at a given time study library material. The fact
that many students who want to use the library facilities
are denied that opportunity may not carry much weight
with the two-thirds of the library users. But there are
other arguments.

VVho can quip effectively about the weather in the at-
mosphere of the reference room? How can one commune
appropriately with the Daily in austerity of the medical
library? Recapturing the witty lectures of a political science
professor in the mustiness of the periodical room—-—is it
possible? Can one, surrounded by airy articles in the An-
nals of the American Academy, appreciate ankles? In
truth the library is designed only for studying library
material.

And there are other campus facilities for study-bent
stu_d\ents—rooms in Folwell, Burton, Pharmacy, Meghan-
ical Engineering, Chemistry, Shevlin, Wesbrook, Psy-
chology, Pillsbury, Anatomy, Law, Mines, Music, Mil.
lard. If the library material and other campus study rooms
were used to capacity the library problem would be sim-
p1iﬁed.——From The Minnesota Daily.

Sleepy Students

-Students conducted the service at a local church Sunday
night and loud was the praise accorded them by church-
goers.

“Is ‘there a Youth Movement in America,” the topic,
was d1scus.sed'by student representatives of several stu-
dent organizations.

“Most students are asleep on their feet” was one stu-
dent's answer to the question of why American students
have no such nation-wide movement as Russia, Germany,
or Italy._ In spite of the laugh this reply brought, it has
an element of truth that might either be alarming or assur-
ing to the nation.

A large youth movement guided in the wrong direction
has all the lumbering momentum of a blind elephant. Mass
action should be spontanecus—neither the unreasoning ac-
tions of a mob or the unthinking acquiescence of a child.

Complaining about the lack of an American youth move-
ment of the old world type is like complaining because
the United States doesn't have its share of those little
intrigues and plots which make Europe such a hot-bed of
unrest at the present time.-—From the Tech Tartan.

New Library3fBooks
By Richard Cooper

Spanish American history leads the list of books which
have come into the University Library during the past
week. _

“The History of the Latin American Nations,” by W11-
liam Spence Robertson of the University of Illinois, cov-
ers the history of South America and Mexico from the
time of the pre-Inca civilizations to the present. It is a
second edition and contains a bibliography and many
maps. “A History of Hispanic America,” by A. Curtis
Wilgus, professor at George Washington University, is
designed for use in classroom work and has references at
the end of each chapter.

A shorter treatment of the subject is “A History of
Latin America” by William VVarren Sweet, of the Uni-
versity of Chicago. This is a revision of the ﬁrst edition,
which was published in 1919.

Etiquette is treated in two new volumes, “A Book of
Modern Etiquette” by Elinor Ames, and “The VOEUC
Book of Etiquette,” written by the editors of “Vogue.” In
these books all problems of etiquette from table manners
and correct dress to “What Are Chaperons For?” are
discussed.

French students will be interested in three new volumes
about the history of French literature. “A Short History
of French Literature” is a translation by C. A. Choquette
and Christian Gauss of Daniel Morney’s “Histoire de la
Litterature et de la Pensee Francaises.” It deals with
French Literature from the “Chanson de Roland” in the
twelfth century to the writings of such modern writers
as Marcel Prevost, Gaston Cherau, and Francois Mauriac.

There are, in addition, two anthologies of French litera-
ture edited by Robert Bell Michell and Robert Foster
Bradley. The ﬁrst, “French Literature Before 1800,” con-
tains works mostly from the 17th and 18 centuries, the
classical period in French literature. The second, “French
Literature of the 19th Century,” contains the works of 28
writers of this period, including Victor Hugo, Honore de
Balzac, Gustave Flaubert, Guy de Maupassant, Emile
Zola, and Anatole France.

Plans For Nationality Rooms In Cathedral
Progress; Donations Mount, $71,000 To Go

Total   Raised (ll$tlllglllSllt‘(l Serbian painters by bios

By Groups For Rooms._
On First Floor

Fifteen nationality groups
raised a total of $128,800 toward the
nationality seminar rooms on the first
floor of the Cathedral, according to
.\lrs. Ruth Crawford Mitchell, adviser
on the nationality rooms project.

The balance of $71,000, promised by
gift pledges, will, according to the
chairmen of the executive committees
of the various groups, be raised by
the end of the current year. It has
been estimated that $200,000 will be
necessary to complete the 15 rooms.

Nationality groups to be represented
by seminar rooms include: French,
German, Italian, Chinese, Greek, Lithu-
anian, Russian, Polish, Roumanian,
Czechoslovakian, Swedish, Hungarian,
Yugoslavian, Scottish, and Norwegian.
English and Syrian groups are also
planning to sponsor seminar rooms.

Indigenous Style Planned

The rooms will be constructed in
the architectural style peculiar to the
country represented. Appointments,
furniture,
keeping with the national racial char-
acteristics, art, and culture.

Concerts, dinners, dances, lectures,
and plays have been held by the groups
to aid in the raising funds. Individuals,
foreign governments, legations, lodges
and fraternal and business organiza-
tions of racial groups have made con-
tributions.

In addition - to contributions of
money, such valuable donations have
been received as a replica of the fam-
ous Copernican globe for the Polish
room from the Polish National Al-
liance; a self portrait in bronze pre-
sented by Ivan Mestrovic, famous
Yugoslav sculptor; and two portaits of

and decorations will be in .

Predic. of Belgrade, donated by the
late Michael Pupin.

F2-.mous arcliilects liuvc designed the
rooms. For the most part their plans
have been accepted by the executive
committees and the L.'niversity. Of-

haveiﬁcial sponsorship by the French gov-

ernment insures the authenticity of de-
sign for the French seminar. The Ger-
man committee has obtained the serv-
ices oi Frank O. Lindcr, graduate of
the Berlin Gewerbe Academy, to de-
sign the room.

The Chinese room has been designed
by Tong Kwei, head of the fine arts
department of the University of You-
ching. Mr. Kwci has directed the work
on carvings and paintings which liavc
been made in Pittsburgh.

The design for the Czechoslovak
room was made by Bohumil Slama of
Prague. Dr. Alice Masaryk, daughter
of the former president of Czecho-
slovakia, is a member of the general
committee. The Greek seminar is be-
ing designed by a young Athenian
classicist, John Travios.

Denes Gyorgi, distinguished archi-
tect, is preparing the plans for the
Hungarian room, which, he claims,

will be planned with regard to the
American viewpoint of practical util-

y.

The motif for the Italian room is a
ﬁfteenth century choir stall, designed
by Lorenzo Romanelli, of Florence,
Italy. The drawings for the room have
been executed by Ezio Cerpi, distin-
guished Tuscan architect.

Lithuanian Design Novel

Hand—woven linen will be the wall
covering of the Lithuanian room. It
has been planned by A. Gudaitis, ol
Kaunus. The Wawel castle near Cra-
cow forms the motif for the Polish
room, which has been designed by
Professor Szyszko Bohusz, Polish ar-
chitect.

nnuicrow COLLECTION

(Continued from page 1)

Originally the top of one of the
cases was covered with an elaborate
scheme of decoration. The center of
the wood carving was a large shield
which contained the coat-of arms of
the Darlington family. In order to
modernize the piece, this carving was
removed. The case itself is made up
of four large divisions, each with a
door. The base is made up of four
carved panels.

One of the smaller cases is divided
into two divisions, and. the top is ex-
tensively carved and inlaid. Long
ﬂuted columns are carved around the
edges- The pair of doors at the bot-
tom are inlayed and panelled. On the
sixth ﬂoor the case will be placed in
one of the smaller rooms of the Dar-
lington group.

Originally there was but one case
with a reasonably plain top. This
piece has a large base which narrows
to form a tall cabinet. The cabinet is
divided into three parts, each with six
shelves. The doors are equipped with
long glass panels with rounded tops.
Another case in the group is very
similar but has more elaborate carv-
ing and the tops of the doors are less
curved.

A number of the pieces in the col-
lection have not as yet been provided
for in the sixth-ﬂoor plans. Among
these is a large knee-hole desk with a
ﬂat top and nine drawers. An old
secretary with a graceful raised shelf
at the top is also included. It has 3-
conventional folding desk, but there
is only one drawer in the center. Two
cases with two doors may be used in
the memorial. Most of these pieces
will be used either in central room
of the Darlington collection or in the
library offices. _

The other furniture in the Memorial
library will be built around the old
cases. Shelves, tables and desks will
harmonize with the style of the orig
inals.

‘ROUGH STUFF’ ORDERED
FOR FOOTBALL PLAYERS
DURING COMING WEEKS

Sutherland, Assistant Coaches
Give Individual Instruction
To Aspiring Candidates

 

There's plenty of rough stuff in store
for a squad of 50 Panthers as they open
the second week of the spring training
drills today on the Trees practice ﬁeld.
“Rough stuff” means blocking, tack-
ling, and tough scrimmages for the
boys who eye the positions on the 1936
eleven with no little concern.

Dr. Sutherland directs the p1‘aCtiCC
sessions. Sometimes he stops to ex-
plain, gathering the entire squad about
him near the center of the ﬁeld. Then
he shifts his attention to a group di-
rected by Charles Bowser, assistant
coach. Bowser shows several husky
fullbacks just why that pivot and step
were not executed correctly.

In another corner of the ﬁeld, Mike
Milligan, frosh coach, and Bill Kern,
assistant coach, work out with a squad
of linemen. The candidates pull out
of the line and then crack or bump the
dummy downﬁeld.

Ralph Daugherty, line coach, orders
a center to give the halfback a little
more lead on the pass. Eddie Baker,
backﬁeld coach, instructs several quar-
terbacks in the correct pause on the
shifts in the signals.

Former Stars Back

After individual instruction, Dr.
Sutherland calls two defensive ends
to offer resistance to the blocking backs
and linemen. A halfback drives inside
the end, off tackle, or possibly swings
out wide. Gradually more of the va-
cant positions on the defensive teams
are ﬁlled in as tackles are called into
play, and soon complete teams partici-
pate in active scrimmage.

Several ex-Panther players returned
to school for the past three drills to
see just how the present crop of pros-
pects shape up. Muggsy Skladany,
former All-American end, has been
working out with the ends under Eddie
Hirschberg, end coach, and aiding in
coaching several of the ﬁrst-year pros-
pects, who are in a fast-moving tran-
sitional period in their shift from the
frosh to the varsity brand of ball.

Ted Dailey, ﬂankman opposite Sklad-
any on the same eleven of 1933, took
time off from his coaching duties at
German Township High school to
watch one of the workouts.

Sutherland announced that he would
like to see more candidates report for
the spring training since he is quite
certain that there are many boys in
the University who would stand a good
chance of developing into varsity foot-
ball players.

Candidates for both squad and man-
agerial positions should report imme-
diately to the Stadium oﬂice any af-
ternoon at 3:30 o’clock.

GRAPPLERS PREPARE
FOR WRESTLING EVENT

Novice Intramural Tournament
Starts Wednesday Afternoon

First Tech grabbed off two basket-
ball victories from the Panthers, then
came the flood, and now another phe-
no_menon is about to strike. There'll be
a wrestling show guaranteed not to be
“ﬁxed.:‘ '

Inside information confirms the ru-
mor that the annual Intramural wrest-
ling tournament, scheduled to open
\\-"ednesday. is strictly over and above
board. Sworn aﬂidavits by promoter
Martin J. Feely and general manager,
Eddie Mazeski. give further proof that
this mat performance will not have any
framed bouts.

Conditioning and practice periods.
set for last week, had to be cancelled,
chieﬂy because Eddie Mazeski, Pitt
wrestling savant, was stopped by the
Hood. At ﬁrst glance, this might ap-
pear to be a handicap, but under closer
scrutiny it has a very decided advan-
tage. It will put all contestants on an
equal footing. Those who have waited
until this week to ﬁll out an entry blank
will not suffer any disadvantages.

Neither experience nor knowledge is
necessary for entrance. All that is
needed is a sneaking suspicion that
Hercules, Samson, and George Atlas
weren’t the only strong men in the
world.

Novices will rule the tourney. En-
tries should be in early on the deadline
day. VVednesday, so that pairings can
be made.

Promising Group Of Golfers
Reports For Squad Tryouts

A group of 19 prospective varsity
golfers reported Friday to James Ha-
gan at the Stadium for practice which
will begin this afternoon at the Alcoma
country club.

Competition for starting jobs is ex-
pected to be the keenest since this sport
was added to the athletic roster. Of the
19 candidates, only two were former
letter winners, those being Jack V\7as—
ko and Bob Mease.

Practice sessions will be held daily
at Alcoma, according to Hagan, who
will be in charge of golf this year. In
former years the team used the St.
Clair layout.

Those reporting were: Bill Nicklin,
._Lee Campbell, W. H. Carson, R. M.
Baughman, Frank Souchak, Bob Mease.
Morry Rosenbloom, Don Pritchard,
Chris Herron, Jack Stephens, Clint
Sipe, Pat Symonds, Jolm Hacker, Bill
Blum, John Walmsley, Ralph Cady,
Frank Bonarati, Jack Wasko, and Espe
Rissler.

VARSITY AWARDS GIVEN
TO 30 CROSS COUNTRY,
FOOTBALL ATHLETES

29 Numerals Presented To First
Year Men; Tost Becomes
Honorary Harrier Leader

Those snappy varsity jackets, adding
splotches of color to the campus along
with the ﬁrst week of spring and the
faint rumblings of Dr. Sutherland’s
1936 grid machine, belong to 30 letter
winners of the past fall sports season.

The Pitt jackets were distributed last
week from the Stadium office, in addi-
tion to 29, one short of the varsity
number, sets of numerals for freshman
lettermen.

Three types of the varsity “P” were
offered: the crew neck, the packet, and
the coat sweaters. The new Pitt jacket
sweater was the popular choice of the
1935 varsity group. The sleeves of the
jacket are a red brown swede with the
body of the sweater in the customary
navy blue, buttoning down the front
and carrying the gold “P” on the top
left. Ironically, the jacket carries a
“Trojan” trade—mark.

Freshmen Get Numerals

The yearling numerals “1936” are the
standard dull gold, standing four inches
high. Fifteen football specialists from
the class of ’39 took part in enough
ball games to win awards, as compared
to one less than this number of har-
riers.

Harold Tost was named Honorary
Captain of cross country. Charles
Groat was the only senior letterman in
this sport.

Pitt’s Goal-Line Stand Against USC
Last Fall Cave Kern Biggest ‘Kick’

\\'hen Pitt “socked-it—to—’em, the Trojan chargers in particular, out on
the coast early in December of last foot-oall campaign, it took exactly seven
of those famous Panther defensive “socks” to give Bill Kern, assistant foot-

 

ball coach, the biggest “kick” of his
combined playing-coaching career.

Had a Panther eleven selected a
more opportune occasion, i.e. either
of the New Year's afternoons of 1930
or 1933, that particular goal-line stand
would have gone down in the football
annals as one of the greatest in his-
tory. In fact, that early October
frost-bite against Minnesota in 1933
would have done very well for the
stage of that stand.

Pitt’s intersectional battle with
Southern California was merely that,
another East-\/Vest clash. No national
title or mythical all-time title hinged
on the outcome of the game. Pitt,
beaten by the Irish and tied by Tech
and Fordham, was favored over a
T_rojan war horse that was up to its
neck in a strange two—year mire,
strange to 3. Jones eleven and the
Hollywood rooters.

The scoreboard Showed the east-
ern eleven leading 12-0 as the ball
game roared into the fourth quarter

of play, last December 14. Then it ﬁnally happened. A Trojan aerial at-
tack that had sputtered warnings all afternoon ﬁnally broke loose. An
interception followed by a long pass moved the ball to the seven-yard line,

On the ﬁrst play, an anxious lineman jumped the pass, a whistle
sounded, and a white-shirted official paced off ﬁve yards goalward. First-
and-goal on the two-yard line but Pitt held two bucking backs on the line

Then another Panther lineman charged too soon and it was third-and-
But 11 Panthers spat on grimy palms, hitched
up tight-ﬁtting pads, and found plenty of that “sock-it-to-’em” in reserve
with the result that in exactly two more downs the Southern Cal backs
were still several feet short of a score. The Trojans later scored on a pass

Pitt won no national title in those six _plays but the boys did show the
west coast some of the finer points of tlns “sock-it-to-’em.” So says Bill
Kern, who has seen plenty of real football games in his scouting-coaching

Sowiski And Lindberg Continue

Past Performances Among
University's Athletes

Mike Sowiski, javelin and hurdle
specialist of the track team, and
Russ Lindberg, captain of swimming,
chalked up their ﬁfth and fourth eon-
seeutive semester-victories, respec-
tively, over the books, according to
the scholastic averages of Pitt ath-
letes recently released by Frank
Carver, director of the Stadium press
service.

Lindberg, who holds or has held
virtually every sprint and middle-
distance AMA mark, ranked tenth in
the individual averages with a 2.06
average. Sowiski placed one notch
below Lindy with an even 2.0 mark.

In the team averages, swinnning’s
slide from first to third moved the
former ruuner—up riﬂe group to first
position. Boxing also moved ahead
one notch to the second-place position
in the shift.

The all-sports average moved up-
ward a fraction from 1.221 in the 1935
spring semester to 1.224 for the past
semester. The riﬂe team at the top
averaged 1.57 as compared to the
wrestlers at the other end of the span
with a 1.007 mark.

Joseph Sobkovialt, sharp-shooter on
the riﬂe team, also scored a “bulls-eye”
on his blue-print with a perfect 3.0,
straight “A," average. Florian Zukas
and Lee Truman, also of the group
from the range, followed closely with
2.66 and 2.58, respectively.

Two more captains of sport teams
in addition to Lindberg, Al Paslowski,
boxing, and Ted Roderick, basketball,
were included in the honor group of
N20‘?!

YWCA Members
Plan To Analyze

Yea r’s Program

 

Tomorrow afternoon YVV members
will dissect their program, survey it in
minute detail, re-assemble the parts, and
formulate the organization program for
next year. Or at least that is what the
committee for tomorrow's Evaluation
Conference is hoping for.

The Campus branch of this national
organization now has an all-inclusive
program that ranges from selling candy
to visiting churches or slum districts,
studying Christian convictions, or plan-
ning social gatherings. A part of to-
morrow's discussion will determine just
how inclusive the program should be
for next year, what should be elimi-
nated, and what added.

Another important question to be
considered tomorrow will be means of
having more complete co-operation
with the YMCA and specific arrange-
ments for joint projects for next year.

The conference, to be held in the Y
Club Rooms on Forbes and Bouquet
Streets, is scheduled to begin at 3:30
o’clock. Sara Marie \Vood, Ed37, will
lea.d an opening worship service.

A summary of committee reports
submitted by each YW’ committee will
be given by Jane Kahler, Ed37, as a
starting point for the afternoon dis-
cussion.

Guest speaker for the dinner will be
Miss Marian Clark, Ed19, alumna
chairman of the Silver Jubilee Dinner,
which will be held in the Faculty Club
Rooms on April 22. She will tell of
plans for the affair. Nona Monks, Ed36,
will speak briefly about approaching Y
conventions.

The evening session will include a
discussion period lead by Miss Marie
Russ; a report of the Future Finance
and General Policy committee by its
chairman, Mrs. VV. VV. Mendenhall,
and a review of “Spiritual Poise”, the
religious program for freshman women,
presented by Miss Thyrsa VV. Amos,
dean of women. All are members of the
YVV advisory board.

The conference hours are from 3:30
until 8:30 o'clock, and the dinner is
priced at 35 cents. Any member may
attend, but should sign up in the Y
office by Monday afternoon.

 

Alumnae Meeting

University alumnae are planning a
meeting on Wednesday, April 8, in
Room 1309, Cathedral, to replace the
one postponed from last week. The
meeting, starting at 8 o’clock, will fea-
ture “Health and Recreation," with
Louis Schroeder, director of public re-
creation, as the speaker.

Mrs. James Stinchcomb is program
chairman of the alumnae. Others on
the committee are Elvera Hamstrom,
Mrs. Arnold M. Replog_le, and Bernice
Storey.

At the first formal event on the

A number of former Senior Queens and

As part of the program, the names

octette from the Women's Choral will

sing during the program.

The Pitt News

Heinz House, Soon To Be Replaced, Recalls:
Fire, Historic Six-Day Moving On Wheels

"‘\
J

Dean Of Women’s Offices,
Activities To Be Moved
Into Cathedral

Heinz House now looks down with

disdain on ordinary buildings which are
apparently priming themselves on hav-

ing survived the ﬂood. “\Vhat,” says
Heinz House. ‘_‘is mere water to a

house whose history includes a fire and

a six-week moving day.

“And furthermore,” says Heinz

House, “those little frame shacks that

had to wait for an overflowing river to

sweep them off their feet are just sis-
sies. I was uprooted back in 1920 with-

out feeling any after-effects what-
soever.”
For it seems that Heinz House,

back in the days when, was gently
lifted from its original site, between
State Hall and the as yet non-existent
Alumni Hall, to its present vantage
point on top of the hill. Not a book
fell out nor was a single bit of crockery
cracked in the process.

Burned In 1919
The first Heinz House had not yet
been completely furnished when it
burned down in 1919 following an acci-

dent at a Pitt Players rehearsal being
held in one corner of the building.

Rebuilding was started immediately,
and all the pictures had been hung in
the proper places and all the dishes
stacked in the kitchen cupboard when
another. drawback to Heinz House’s
happiness was discovered. It seemed
that one corner of the building for
which the alumni of the University
were then raising funds, (later to be
known as Alumni Hall) was going to
jut right into the Heinz House fire-
place.

Accordingly, surrounded by stilts,
wheels, and other paraphernalia, Heinz
House was transported from its mid-
way place to its present position. Miss
Thyrsa VV. Amos, who was appointed
dean of women in 1919, and her newly
named assistant, Miss Helen P. Rush,
who graduated from the University in
1919, were invi-t_ed to carry their work
on as usual in Heinz House during the
six weeks in which it was being moved.
“But,” says Miss Rush, “we felt, it
would be rather awkward to live in a
moving building.”

Heinz House will be replaced even-
tually by the women’s floor being
planned for the Cathedral, but in the
meantime it is being used for social
activities by more than “30,000 people
a. year.”——l§ H,

\

The Heinz House

The building which has served women at the University since it was
ﬁrst erected as a temporary structure midway between State Hall and a
non_-existent Alumni Hall in 1919. Next semester it will be replaced by the
women’s floor in the Cathedral. Until then, it laughs at ﬂoods.

Club To Sponsor
Musical Journey

Through Eu rope

 

\Vould you like to hear a Russian
mazurka or a Hungarian czardas? Do
you know how many nationalities are
represented in Pittsburgh? These are
the questions that white folders cir-
culated by members of Inter-Cultural
Associates are asking.

They invite the reader to “Tour Mu-
sically through Europe with the Inter-
Cultural Associates” at 8 o’clock to-
morrow evening at Heinz House. There
are to be European folk songs and
dances interpreted by a string trio.

Mrs. Ruth Crawford Mitchell, adviser
to the Nationality Rooms Committee,
will be guest speaker. Her topic will be
“Europe in Pittsburgh.”

This same folder tells the purpose

of ICA in these words. “To promote an
appreciation of personalities through
an understanding of national and racial
cultures,,literatures, customs,‘ and tradi-
tions; to encourage inter-cultural friend-
ships by providing opportunity for rep-
resentatives of different cultures to
meet and become acquainted.”

Siedle Discusses
Applying For Job
AtMeeting Today

To help senior women who for years
have been wondering how they’d do
it when it came time to apply for a
job; to shovg- them how to write an
application, what size picture to use,
and what type letter is best; there will
be a second meeting in the series
planned for seniors in Room 114,
Alumni Hall, today at 12:30 o’clock.

Theodore A. Siedle, assistant dean
of the School of Education, will address
the meeting, speaking on, “Shall I
write a Letter of Application and
How?”

At the meeting last week, Miss Anne
Fineman and Miss Edith Jamieson,
members of the Retail Training Bu-
reau staff discussed the question of
“Applying For a Job.”

At each of the meetings in this series,
topics of particular interest to seniors
on the technique of applying for jobs
will be discussed.
