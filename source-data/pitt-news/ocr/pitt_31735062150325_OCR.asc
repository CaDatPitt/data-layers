To Clean Up

 

Alumni Hall  

Coeds win Begin Cam-
paign Monday

 

The “campus clean-up.” advo-
Governing Association, and Wom-
en’s Athletic Association, is to 80
into effect Monday morning.

When students arrive at Alumni
Hall next week, they will ﬁnd_a
dozen new waste baskets distrib-
uted through the corridors, posters
on the bulletin board, emphasizing
the importance of keeping halls
and class rooms free from waste, as
vigilant committees seek to"remind
them that the place for discarded
papers is in receptacles and not on
the ﬂoor.

Disturbed at the slovenly condi-
tion in which Alumni Hall is put
each day by careless students who
leave newspapers. candy wrappers,
and milk ‘bottles scattered about
class rooms and T corridors, the
three women's organizations have
taken steps to educate undergradu-
ates to a. realization of the signiﬁ-
cance in keeping the principal
campus building in IJI'eS911t3-ble
condition.

The administration, has ex-
pressed its approval of the “clean-
up campaign” and has commended
the coed groups for the stand they
have taken.

Visitors to the campus recently
directed the attention of the _ad-
ministration and the coed orgé_1Il1Za-

International Debate
Tomorrow Night

It will be the American system,
charity, against the English,
dole, as a means ofcombatting the
evils of unemployment when Rich-
ard Murphy and Albert E. Leven,
Pitt graduate debaters meet Stuart
Craig and John Needham, the Not-
tingham-Durham graduates, from
England, tomorrow evening at 8:15
in Schenley High School audi-
torium.

The subject of the debate is,
“Resolved: that the dole system
provides a better method of relief
that charity.”

There will be no judges for the
debate; an audience vote will be
taken before and after the debate
as an expression of opinion on the
relative merits of the two systems.
It is the purpose of the debate to

get at the truth, rather .than score

hits or win victories, to show the
best points of the American and
British systems so that the audi-
ence may see their respective
values.
Murphy Well Qualiﬁed.

Murphy and Leven have been as-
sociated since Leven’s undergrad-
uate days,” graduating in 1927, Mur-
phy became instructor in public
speaking at the university. While
in England last summer, he made
a. study of the dole system and will
be well qualiﬁed to refuse the Eng-
lishmen.

Albert Leven, graduating from
the School of Business Administra-
tion in 1929, is now a senior in Pitt
Law School. In 1928 he was a

‘member of the university debate

squad that toured Canada and in
1929 made a trip to the Paciﬁc

Coast.

As an extra means ofTacquaint-
ing the public with conditions as
they exist in England and America,
the debates will answer questions
after the debate.

Armistice Day, Wednesday,

the University. Classes will
not meet and all offices will
be closed.

No Holiday

Next Monday

Students Granted Day Off
In May Instead

 

Win or lose, in tomorrow's game
with Tech there will be school for
Pitt students Monday. The rea-
son for this is the University's de-
cision last year to accede to Stu-
dent Council's request to postpone
holiday until the early part of May,
in order to promote the success of
Senior Week events.

Dean of Men Robert -C. Clothier,
in a_statement to the Pitt Weekly,
said: “This\action was taken in
view of the several considerations.
The football holiday, dependent as
it has been up-on victory, is uncer-
tain. Experience has shown that

morning at 9 o’clock. They will as-
semble and march across the
Smitliﬁeld street bridge, up Grant
street, and then pass in review be-
fore a galaxy of notables in a spe-

cial reviewing stand in front of the
City-County Building.

,In the stands will be Secretary
of War P. J. Hurley, acting as rep-
resentative of President Hoover;
General Douglas MacArthur, high-
est ranking officer in the United
States; Major General Smith, su-
perintendent of West Point; Gov-
ernor Gifford, Pinchot, and the
members. of his staff; Maygr
Charles H. Kline, and his cabinet‘,
the members of the city-council;
Chancellor John G. Bowman, and
James Francis Burke.

Lunch at Mosque

The cadets will then go to the
William: Penn Hotel, their head-
quarters. At 11:45 they will lunch
in Syria Mosque, as guests of the
University. At 1 o’clock the 1,300
West Pointers will march into the
stadium, and, before taking their
seats, will thrill the spectators with
their traditionally exact formations.

Secretary Hurley and General
MacArthur, both guests of‘James
Francis Burke, will sit in the Army
section of the stadium; Governor
Pinchot, and Major General Smith,
guests of Chancellor Bowman, will
sit in the Pitt section. ‘

A memorial service will be held
between halves in tribute to the
late Knute Rockne. The Cadet
Choir will sing, and cadet buglers
will sound taps.

 
    

man’s Department store,
auspices of the Benny Haven
an organization of Army alumni.
In the evening the cadets, the
football squads, members of the
third and fourth year course of the

ber of prominent guests will at-
tend the colorful Military Ball in
the William Penn ballrooms, where
300 Pitt co-eds will act as host-
esses. The dance has been ar-
ranged by prominent Pittsburghers
and oﬁlcers of the Benny Haven
Club.

At 12:15 Sunday morning the
cadets will form at the P. & L. E.
railroad station, and then entrain
for West Point, where life is just

where a football holiday has been
declared the students do not use it
for any worthwhile University pur-
pose, but for the most part simply
remain at home.

“It is generally.agreed that tak-
'ing a day out of an already crowded
University calendar for no good
reason is not playing fair to the
students whose purpose is serious,
01 with those parents who are mak-
ing sacriﬁces that their sons and
daughters may .secure the maxi-
mum bcneﬁt from their University
career. The holiday in May is cer-
tain and not dependent upon a vic-
tory ln an athletic contest, and the
‘likelihood of good weather condi-
tions for outside activities is much
greater than in the fall.” .

Students who do not go to class
Monday will be charged with im-
excused absences.

Must Coeds Don Military Uniforms To Learn How To

Give Commands?

 

Batteree-ee— ’Ten-——SHUN I

Ten charming co-eds in color-

ful cloaks and caps! How are good soldiers expected to march,

eyes, front, with attendants such as these?

Ten co-eds chosen

for——um-m-m——are now honorary members of the R. O. T. C.

The senior women who have joined the army are Edith
Raschen, sponsor of the Regiment; Lida. Jones, sponsor of the
First Battalion; Adelaide Hunter, sponsor of Battery A; Ger-

trude Rectenwald, sponsor of Bat:

tery B, Elaine Foraker, sponsor of
Battery C, Christine Ruoff, sponsor
of the Second Battalion, Anne Ko-
vach, sponsor of Battery D, Mildred
Wakeﬁeld, sponsor of Battery E.
Sally Moore, sponsor of Battery F,
and Edith Hirsch of the Band.

It is rumored that the army is
trying to prove that ‘Sherman was
wrong, when they elect coeds to
help them lighten‘ this serious bus-
iness of war. But they are prepar-
ed now, and the coeds are ready
for action. For why should such
snappy uniforms be wasted? Of
course we must have them to com-
pete with the United States Mili-
tary Academy when they attempt
to defeat the Panthers on Novem-
ber 14.

There certainly isn't any No

coeds march with the R. O. T. C.
at the Tech game, and at the Army
game, watching the field surround-
ed by the guard of honor. They
will participate in the ball given
fortlie VVest Point cadets on No-
vember 14. But their big moment
will come at the Military Ball,
when they receive their gold epaul-
ets.

The whole regiment has a spon-
sor; both of the battalions have
sponsors; and each battery has its
sponsor; but the poor panther, no-
ble king of cutups, has been left
out. He should have a sponsortwigh

army mule.

And the coeds want to know if
the captains will be buried-or

Fraternity
Rush Season
Opens Today

Men Seek New Members
In Nine-Day Period;
Plan Many Events

 

With the ringing of the 8:30 bell
this morning, it was to some just
the beginning of another day. To
the eighteen men's social fraterni-
ties on campus it was the signal
to open rushing season, one which
they had eagerly been waiting for
during the past few days. This
event, conspicuous each year for
its beforehand discussion, after-
ward argument, and in-between ex-
citement ofyarying degrees, will
be officially brought to an ‘end, at
2 o'clock, Sunday morning, No-
vember 15. ‘

As‘ last year, any upp-erclassmen,

having the necessary twelve qual-
ity points and twelve credits, will}

be eligible to enjoy the whirl of) 

smokers, dinners, and special
events, and to be initiated into one
of the several Greek letter socie-l
ties, Not having these qualiﬁca-'
tions,_he may be eligible for pledg-
ing, but may not be initiated until’
he has fulﬁlled the requirements.
Failing to do so within the imme-,
diately following semester, any)
and all students will be depledged.

No restrictions have been placed
upon the fraternities. other than
that pledging events limited to
two, must be brought to a close by
midnight on eveningsof which a
school day follows. Most of the
rushing events will be «held this
evening and tomorrow evening,-
I‘uesday,Friday and Saturday even-
ing during the’ coming week.

It is expected that since Wednes-
day, Armistice Day, is to be a
school holiday, most of the socie-
ties will hold one of the twp spe-
cial events the previous evening.

Favor Luncheon Rushes.

Arguing that to hold four rush-
ing events this year would work a
hardship, ﬁnancially, upon most of
the fraternities. council favoredthe
luncheon meetings and small get-
together gatherings to the large
special events. ..

Silence period, beginning at the
closing of rushing season next Sun-
day morning, will continue until
Thursday afternoon, November 19,
at 5 o'clock. Fraternity men will
be forbidden. to converse with any
freshman during this time. Men

period, make their choice known ‘in,

Business Men
Hear Watkins

Research Head Speaks At
A. K. Psi Luncheon

 

Speaking before members of the
Pitt Business Men’s Luncheon Club
yesterday on “The Business CY-
cle,” Dr. Ralph J. Watkins, direc-
tor of the Bureau of Business Re-
search, predicted that- recovery
from the current business depres-
sion should begin about January
1932, and that a return to normalcy
might be achieved at the earliest
by September, 1932.

Dr. Watkins based his statement
upon the recovery trends of the
seven depressions which have
taken place .in this country during
the past 50 years, but added that
to prophesy normalcy by ‘Septem-
ber, 1932, would be rash interpre-
tation of statistics.

Two .conclusions were drawn by
Dr. Watkins with reference to the
present condition: First, that ‘de-
pressions are becoming more se-
vere, and second, that there has
been a deﬁnite breakdown of the
policy of “laissez-faire,” resulting
in a new kind of controlled econ-
omy which probably will continue
for the next 20 years.

More than 100 persons attended
the luncheon held in the Chamber
of Commerce dining room.

These weekly luncheons, spon-
sored by Alpha Kappa Psi, business
professional fraternity, are an out-
growth of a series of professional
luncheons inaugurated last year.
In an attempt to make the meet-
ings of greater value this year, A1-
plia Kappa Psi has arranged an
imposing six month program. Ef-
forts have been made to secure six
outstanding speakers for the ser-
ies. The group will be adressed by
a different speaker each month.

Next Thursday, November 12, Dr.
Watkins will continue his series
with an, address on “The- Problem

Letters

- Novembfr 3, 1931.

To the Editor of Pitt Weekly:

Are we kidding ourselves?
Do we want Freshman Regula-
tions? Do we need them?

Before answering these ques-
tions, Mr. Editor, I wish to re-

 consider a few statements you

made in your editorial of last
week.
The “spectacle which seemed-
both sily and disgusting to
anystudent who boasts of av-
‘; erage college intelligence” is,
I take it, an insinuation that
all those students who took
part in the_ enforcing program
are below par in intelligence.
Now, Mr. Editor, do you con-
sider yourself below average in-
telligence’ if you take part in
' the paddling of the pledges to

your fraternity. I know you
do not and neither do I consid-
er you so.

Surely there is a clear con-
nection between paddling a

,_pledge and .paddling a Fresh-
'm_an on the Campus. And for
- good reason_ . too.

Again. you stated in your

_ article that only about a dozen
eshmen “assumed the angle”
during the performance. Evi-
dently you were not present at
the occasion, or you would
have been quite a bit more accu-
rate in your ﬁgures. Further-
more, Mr. Editor, no member
of the Customs Committee ad-
mitted or intimated failure in
this undertaking. On the. other
hand, we were well pleased
with the spirit shown by the
“Frosh, during the session. We
f claim Frosh Customs to be a
partial success as was evi-
denced by the increased num-
ber of “dinksf’ and “ties” which
appeared on the Campus the
following Monday.
ml will admit, however, that
the ‘episode was disorderly and
unplanned. This We could not
‘help, as we did not receive the
right kind’ of support from the
upperclassmen. Our idea was
to paddle those Freshmen who
had not_appeared at the trial
held for them and also those
_iFrosh found without caps and
ties. This we were justiﬁed in
doing, after having warned and
advised them in so many differ-
ent ways.-

The whole idea behind Frosh
Customs in general, is not to
intimidate the Freshman into
doing what we say, but to in-
still, in him a sense of class
loyalty that will last thru his
college career. ,

Remember. that we have
been talked of as having no
‘school Lspirit. But why not cre-
ate a school spirit by instill-
ing in the ﬁrst-year-men a love
and a respect for their Alma.

Mr. Editor, I have taken this
' opportunity to explain to you
the views of the_Committee on
this“ important subject. I ex-
press a belief that the present
Freshman . class will adopt
these or similar views next‘
year, and that each succeeding
Sophomore class will adopt
them, thereby helping to create
a spirit at Pitt that will be
Pitt-'s own.
Respectfully ‘ yours,
EMRIC FORMICHELLA,
Customs Committee.

others as far as racial differences
is concerned because of evolution-

Many Jobs -for Students

 

For the University student who

‘has been saturated with unemploy-
cment talk until he believes there

are no jobs to be had, a visit to the
Employment Bureau will probably
offer a revelation to him. Quite a
few men who have applied here are
clerking in stores. especially those
in the Atlantic and Paciﬁc Com-
pany chain. Others are making’
money in ﬁelds as widely diver-
gent as blood transfusion and neck-
tie selling. A

The main source of employment,
however, is salesmanship. There
are literally hundreds of oppor-
tunities for enterprising students
to make money. Some of the com-
panies pay a regular salary to sales-
men, but a big majority operate on
a, straight commission basis.

Sell Mats at Games

Many students on the campus
availed themselves of these oppor-
tunities. One group of boys have
succeeded in organizing a steady
business in the sale of mats for

stadium fans to sit on at football
games. Others are selling maga-
zines.

The heaviest demand from the

manufacturers is for men to sellé

Christmas greeting cards. Next
come the jewelry men with re-
quests for student salesmen. Maga-
zine solicitors, always welcome to
publishers, have the third greatest
opening.

A demand also exists for stu-
dents to handle railroad, bus, and
even airplane tickets. In any of
these lines a steady business could
be built up. Other important open-
ings are in the sale of ties, hand-
kerchiefs, and even shoelaces.

Robert Ripley, creator of the fa-
mous “Believe It or Not” feature,
is putting out ‘Christmas postcards
with the caption “Believe it or not.
this is a letter from Santa Claus."
The cards are postmarked at the
village of Santa Claus, Indiana.
Some enterprising youth could put
these over big here at Pitt.

Pacifist Arguments
Refuted by Schrader

 

“The more horrible we make war.
the more destructive and death-
dealing it becomes, the sooner we
will approach a millenium of
peace,” declared Major 0. H.
Schrader of the military Science
department before thirty members
of the Inquiry Club last Wednes-

day. “We must speak softly and
carry ‘a big stick,” continued
Schi-ader.

In a scathing condemnation of
paciﬁsts Major Schrader said that

they must have a low degree of in-
telligence to criticize the remarks
of George Washington and Abra-
ham Lincoln. Armed conﬂict is as
old as the world, said Major Schra-
‘-der and the occupation of the war-
rior is second oniy to the occupa-
tion of the hunter in man's evolu-
tion.

Major Schrader’s talk was in
answer to the one given last week
by Dr. Benjamin, Williams.

New Mellon Institjute

To be Most Modern
Equipped Lab

 

With four huge cranes lift-
ing the steel beams, the frame-
work for the new building of
the Mellon Institute, Fifth and
Belleﬁeld avenues, should be
completed by the ﬂrst of the
year, according to Wiliam Hip-
sley, Mellon-Stuart engineer in
charge. Concrete elevator ma-
chinery bases, and concrete
foundation walls are being
poured. Actual delivery of
limestone will not begin until
late late next spring.

In the meantime, the Mellon
Institute is making elaborate
plans for the interior ﬁttings
of the new building. In the In-

stitute building on Frick Acres,
experiments to deﬁrmine the
suitability and worth of various
products are being made. It is
hoped to make the new build-
ing the best equipped and most
thorughly modern and age-
proof laboratories yet construct-
ed. Charles Earhart is in charge
of the practical end of these
experiments.

Pledging ceremonies and fraternity
dinners will follow.

Last year, for infractions of the
rules\l@.id down by the Council, sev-
eral fraternities were ﬁned [$75 and,
placed on probation for a year. It
was argued that the misunder-
standing grew out of the lack of
conclusive regulations. This year
fraternities are warned, that unless
they follow the rules, ﬁnes will be
imposed.

Franklin Goodfellow, president of

ing that this year’s competition will
be especially keen on account of
economic conditions, also stated
that the total pledges should ex-

'32, who with Mary Garber, Ed. ’33,
represented Pitt at the N. P. C.
Convention in St. Louis last week,
which included, presidents and rep-
resentatives of undergraduate Pan-
hellenic associations.

“The women's interfraternity
spirit at Pitt is so far advanced,”
says Miss Levenson, “that our de-
ferred rushing program can be
carried out with more cooperation
and good feeling than is ‘possible
in any of the other colleges repre-
sented in N. P. C. '

hellenic program were suggested
It was the only council vrepresented

include no dances.

cessful, including free movies. eats
and free dancing at South Bend's

saying, “Steps died out from lack
of interest on the part of students.
The Panther, in devoting an issue

approve of anything that is an en-
couragement to writing.”

Walter Rome is enthusiastic over
the project. He declared, “There

At any rate. we may be justified in
supposing that such amateur polit-

cure for eighteen University grad-

now hold.

The latest copy of the Pennsyl-
vania annual gives the University
as the alma mater of one United
States Senator, one Congresman,
nine jurists, one state senator,
four state representatives, and the
clerk of the stat. Senate.

representative in the national Sen-
ate, graduated from the University
in 1903. ‘

Boxers Show
At Y Smoker

Collegiate Heavyweights
May Be Eliminated

 

Boxing workouts continue with-
out any sign of a let-up in the im-
mediate future. To decide upon the
squad to concentrate attention up-
on, Coach Orsini has decided to
hold the college championships
during the week oflDecember 14.

The interfraternity boxing tourn-
ament has been deﬁnitely organ-
ized, and will be over in time for
the winners to compete in the col-

lege championschlps if they so de-

:sire. ‘
Three Bouts

Boys who have never had any
ring ‘experience are welcome to
come out for the team“, and have as
good a chance as anyone to make
the squad. This fact was well
demonstrated at a “Y” smoker
given at the Activities Building
on Wednesday night.
Threeﬁghts were held at this

smoker two in the 135 pound class,
and one in the 145 pound class. In
the 135 pound ﬁghts, Eddie Fred-
land and Bert Taylor put on a fast
exhibition, and Bill Evans and
Dale Madelon put on a. bout that
showed more clearly the ﬁne points
of blocking and jabbing.

‘Henry Martin and‘ Matty Rubbo
ended, the evening in a real slug-
ging match. Both boys looked
good. Of these six ﬁghters, only
Martin and Rubbo have had any
previous ring experience.

Orsini Arranges Bouts

The ﬁghters were seconded by
Pete Silverhart and Paul Newman,
while Harry Conti refereed. Jacob
Alpert and Morris Cohen were
timers, and Hy Cohen announced
the ﬁghters. The bouts were ar-
ranged by Coach Orsini.

There is a movement on foot,
which Coach Orsini does not ap-
prove. of abolishing the heavy-
weight class in intercollegiate
boxing. “We need more students
to report now,” said Orsini, “or
the ‘heavyweight class will be elim-
inated. When football season ends
we will have Johnny Lu-ch, “Rip”
Collins, Tar Onder and John Va-
lenti, and it can easily be seen that
we have good prospects."

Varsity Riﬂe Squad

Includes Sixteen Men

, Intensive drill in shooting is on
the books from now on for the
sixteen candidates chosen to make
up the varsity riﬂe squad. The
prospects are bright for a better
season than that of last year.
Those making the squad are:
Wuertenberger, who is also man-
ager, Wilson, Lauder, Zoller, Mas-
trucci, Mair, Franz, Babyock. Hol-
brook, Gallagher, Berquist, Taussig,
Currie, Geier, Baird, and Captain
Backen.
This is Backen’s third year as a
member of the riﬂe team, but it is
the ﬁrst in which he has acted in
the capacity of captain. Backen has
twice won the silver medal -for
placing second in the regional
meets. ._

The gunning season opens No-
vember 23.

Sophs to Fill
Cage Position

Ochsenhirt, Mccamant
Seek Guard Berth

 

In ﬁlling the open guard berth
opposite the ever reliable Don
Smith, Doc Carlson will be forced
to depend upon two sophomores to
carry the burden. Ochsenhirt and
McCamant, both tall rangy lads are
expected to ﬁght it out for the
coveted position. - I

Ochsenhirt is a Pittsburgh boy,
hailing from Perry High, just a

short way out past the domain of

Timmy Lawry, the Panther co-
captain. Ochsenhirt, though never.
a wonder in high school, has blos-
somed forth as a star of the ﬁrst
water since coming to Pitt. Last

-year he led the frosh quintet in

scoring, and by the concluding
game had stamped himself as the
ohtstanding man on the squad.

~McCamant is a Sharon lad, hav-
ing been formerly a main cog in
the state champion’s quintet of
1929. Last year this tall but slim
cager was forced out by illness
after performing brilliantly in the
opening games of the season.

Experienced Reserves

The presence of Tip Kowallis, Al
Wrobleski, and Brown provides an-
other group of experienced ﬂoor-
men to the Braddock mentor, and
undoubtedly he will need them all

before the campaign is over. At,

any rate you may count on the
Pittites having a mighty classy ag-
gregation on the hardwoods this
winter, especially with such experi-
enced cagers as Lawry, Docky Ko-
wa.11is,‘A11bright, and_ Smith hang-
ing around.

Zehfuss.’ together’ with ‘Doc”
Carlson, has been teaching the of-
fensive part of the much compli-

cated Pitt system. It is a safe bet
that the boys know more about
offensive basketball than they did
before. It is one tough system ac-
cording to, most freshman aspir-
ants. -
, Schedule Tough

The schedule for the freshmen is
anything but easy. They open with
Taylor Allderdice High School as
a preliminary to the Varsity-Tem-
ple game on December 12. Schen-
ley High is met on December 19;
and on January 16th, the night of
the Pitt-New York U. game, the
frosh meet Uniontown Junior Col-
legs.

The freshman and varsity quin-
tets will be hosts to Carnegie’s
ﬁoormen at the Stadium on Janu-
ary 20. Johnstown Junior College
is here on January 23. January 30
will see they Mountaineers of West
Virginia resume their feud in fresh-
man basketball and varsity boxing
at the Stadium. Carnegie is to be
met at Tech gym on February 2.

The frosh will travel to Union-
town /and Johnstown Junior Col-
leges on February 13 and 17, re-
spectively. Wash-Jeff will be here
on arch 3, while Penn State is
sen ing its frosh here March 7.
The Little Panthers will -conclude
their season at Morgjintown on
March 8. ‘

Smooth Aggregation ‘

V. Indications are that the early-
comers at Stadium games will see
a -smootli functioning ,machine.
There is still a scramble for the
positions, but at the present time,
“Whitey” Wilson, Wanio, Eicher,
and Wadsworth are leading the
candidates for forward‘ berths.
Cribbs and Zelesnich are due to
ﬁght it out for the center job, while
the guards will probably be han-
dled by Kuno, Brooks, and Ames
The goal of Paul Zehfuss is to
emulate, if possible, the records of
the past frosh squads. If material
is a criterion, his success is nearly
assured.

\

Coming up against the best team
they have faced this season, the
Pitt frosh were ﬁnally beaten. The

West Virginia frosh proved to be
the undoing of the little Panthers,
beating them 12-0. Despite the fact
that they were beaten by two
touchdowns, the local freshmen
fought as if inspired and outplayed
the Mountaineers in the third quar-
ter, when they had the ball on the
one-yard line, but couldn’t push it
over. The best player for the Pitt
team was “Iz” Weinstock, who
played a great game. He was .out-
standing, plunging into the West
Virginia line time and again for
good gains.

This West Virginia team is the
best one they have had in a long
time. and the fashion in which
they beat the local team proves
that they are plenty strong. How-
ever, doing a bit of ﬁguring, they
lost to Tech; Pitt and Tech played
to a scoreless tie; and Kiski beat
the Tech team very badly, which
means that the Pitt frosh are going
to have a tough job on their hands
when they tackle the Kiski team
next. Friday. This is the last game
of the season for the Pitt year-
lings, and they are going out to do
their best to keep the number of
defeats down to one.

Frosh Coeds
To Get Pins

Hold Ceremony Nov. 24;
Cards Due Nov. 17

 

 

“We expect to give about forty
Merit Panthers to freshman wo-
men who have cooperated with
Customs,” says Dorothy Lewis,
Col. ’34, chairman of Customs Com-
mittee.

Freshman customs cards wil_l be
turned in November 17 and on No-
vember 24 the women will receive
their Panthers at the traditional
ceremony.

The custom of giving Panthers to
deservingfreshmen dates back six
years. The Panther of that time
was a blue and gold felt affair to
,be worn on sport sweaters. A few
,’ years later a small silver stick pin
was adopted. The present type of
pin was adopted two years ago and
is a brooch pin with the image of
the Panther in silver. \

The women who will receive the
Panther on November 24 will have
complied with thefollowing regu-
lations:

1. Attend events planned es-
pecially for freshmen during
the first ‘six weeks of school.

2. Have a. “C” average, no
failure, or incomplete work. '
3. Comply with customs reg-

ulations.
4. Be -regular attendant at

Senior Mentor meetings.

v. 5. Pass customs test on

speciﬁed dates.

6. Show true Pitt spirit.

The Pittsburgh college grid teams may be through with Notre Dame proper for the balance of the season, but a former Notre Dame player who transferred to Carnegie .Tech
at the beginning of the present season may cause a furore in the city -championship tilt tomorrow.

other men who are expected to shine for “dear old Tech” include Henry Drcshcr, a brother of John, last year's Carnegie captain; Stuart Ducgcr, who replaced Harry Mc-
Curdy as the regular quarterback last year whcnlhc was a sophomore and who is holding down the same post this season; Jerry O'Toole, another sophomore, who was shifted
from the center post to fullback due to a dearth of material in_thc latter department and has justified the conﬁdence placed in «him by Coaches Steffen and Waddcll, and Don
Fletcher, senior lineman, who has been troubled by injuries since his entrance into the local school and who~wili face Pitt for the last time tomorrow.

Meeting in Toledo, Ohio

Freshman customs appeared to
be at a, standstill today amid a

storm of protest and .counter-pro-

ed in the last issue of the Pitt

ten letters setting forth their views
on the matter. In face of this con-

are still maintaining their vigilance,
in an effort to keep freshmen with-
in the bounds as prescribed by the
customs committee of Student
Council.

In connection with the annual
Pitt-Carnegie Tech game tomorrow,
all freshmen are to attend the
game wearing their dinks and ties.
An appeal is being made to the

Pitt Football Captain Reminisces On Old Times 
Visit To McKeesport High School

 

Eddie Hirshberg, captain of the football team, and a journ-
alist of promise, assumed a new role last Tuesday, when he
spoke at a special chapel service at McKeesport High school.
Eddie is one of McKeesp0rt’s favorite sons, and the Tube City
had to show its appreciation of its football hero in some way,
so Eddie was coaxed, cajoled or threatened into addressing the
student body of his erstwhile Alma Mater.

Rushing Season

 

HE TIME HAS COME when

the Freshman must make

, . two decisi-ons. Shall be join a

*1:-T7‘ fraternity, and if he does care

to join, what fraternity shall
it be? '

He is going to have a hard

time this year ﬁnding the an-

swers to these questions. To-

 

the whirlpool of rushing, and
for the next week. he will be
subjected to a barrage of social
events and a. round of rhapso-
dies on the value of the frater-
nal life.

Rushing this year promises
to be intense and bitter. Fresh-
men are going to be pursued
relentlessly, with the result
that they may 1 be swept off
their feet unless they are able
to keep the entire fraternity
situation clearin mind.

It is admitted, of course, that
the fraternity has certain inval-
uable beneﬂts, and the Fresh-
man should judge a house by
its highest standard-——-not by its
worst. With such an attitude

.\ 5

 

 

the rushee should realize that _

a fraternitymay be composedof
'.. a group of men who are con-
genial in habit, thought, dress,
manner, physical and mental
equipment; One has to go
through life ‘ affiliated with
groups. . ..his family, his busi-
ness, or his religion. It is good,
therefore. to derive certain ex-
periences which life as lived in
a. fraternity can give him.

The fraternity house which
serves‘ only as a place where
the radio plays jazz from» morn-
ing to night, where there is
drinking and loalﬂng, and where
the talk is of nothing but games
coeds and the movies, has
largely disappeared from the
campus scene. It was bad and
had no part in the life of a col-
lege.

Yet the freshman must remem-
ber that in a week of mad rush-
ing every house will be on its
good behavior and the congen-
ial atmosphere thus presented
is not always indicative of the
fraternity life. . He‘ should re-

9

make up his fraternity are the
men with whom he will have to
associate for at least the next
three years. He should re-
member that he assumes defin-
ite obligations when he takes
“the pin of allegiance. More ab-
stractly, he should remember
that a. fraternity can be suc-
cessful only when it endorses
the policy for which the Univer-
sity stands, namely, that in the
four years of college life a
young man, must have the best
opportunity to develop morally,
,.physically_ and intellectually.
So Freshman, think carefully
F .and think for yourself!

Welfare Drive

 

' HAT CAN the College stu-
dent do to help in the an-

nual Allegheny County welfare
drive which opens Monday
morning? The answer is: he
can contribute his share. He
knows of many manys to ob-
tain that share. He can go
without that extra pack of‘
cigarettes; he can pass up the
weekly visit to the show; he
might even arrange for a “par-
lor date” instead of the week-

end invasion of the dance
ﬂoor.
Unemployment has brought

hardship to many families in
‘Allegheny County. For some
of these families, the winter
ahead will mean (not only
‘hardship, but actual hunger
and physical suffering. unless
we help them. —

The income of the college
student is, of necessity, small
but it is usually sufficient to
give him his share .of weekly
amusements. It will be worth

‘ a. sacriﬁce though to help out
his neighbor.

The Medley

A Mixture of
Things Artistic

p  bye...
'—-— Gladys Schmltt

Most of us live in little things-
in one day and then another day,
in the cereal we had for breakfast
or the book we read yesterday
(which we thought——-yesterday-—
was the greatest book in the
world). It is very seldom that we
look at our existences as things
integral and centered, and still
more seldom that we look at the
world in general with a clear and
correlated eye. But this week there
was ap generality about things ar-

 

. choose, ' to understand.-

tistic, and we were forced to get
a glimpse of the whole survey, in
spite of ourselves.

First. there is the International.
For the past two weeks we have
wandered through it, trying to
consider by law and reason, to
There is
the ﬁrst prize--crude strength,
monstrous virility -.- incomprehen-
sible beside last year’s elusive Pi-
casso. There is the early Gothic
reverence of Santos, the too-glow-
ing, romantic world of Sidaner,
There is Matisse,——strange perfec-
tion dressed in obvious imperfect-
ness. And there are the crowds of
the Traditionals, still painting their
ladies, their ﬂowers, their ﬁnan-

~ ciers, their perfect sofa-pillows and

their stolid little boys. And among
them all -— our laws constantly
changing, our whole life-views re-
versing before every picture——-we
are sure of nothing except that
there is no unity.
It 0 C
It is a long time since there
has been any unity in any of
the arts. We have had our
broken - color impressionists,
our imagists and objectivists.
our cubists, our stream-of-com
sciousness. We have seen art-
ists going back to the Byzan-
tine, musicians turning again
to Gluck, poets drawing the
K very blood of their work from
ancient Chinese. And, looking
behind us at other years, we
are almost startled that it
should not always have been

so.
For, “ until today, the arts
have known above all things
a certain spiritual, factual, and

technical unity. Elizabethan

Literature, Renaissance Paint-
ing, Greek Sculpture, Roman-
tic Music—each was a new
play of light working upon
something as consistent and
uniﬁed as a crystal globe. Each
varied in its colors and inten-
sity, each accented new shad-
ows, caught new lights; but
each was consistent and inte-
grated within itself, each was
an established entity. And now
it is as though the globe had
‘ fallen, had been shattered into
a. hundred glittering bits, each
centreless, each divided from
those other parts which were
once its very self. And there
is no longer any law by which
to judge. Each artist has his
own law, and we are lost.

I I C

The same melancholy moved
around us when we heard the sym-
phony concert at the Mosque on
Friday evening. The Handel
warmed us with its grave adequacy,
and we understood and were as-
sured and composed. But the pro-
gram went on to the intelligent,
technically perfect, decadent De-

bussy, to the incomprehensible
Ravel, to the strained ardor and
grand technical genius of a

Strauss trying to evoke the ghost
of a lost Eroica. And before the
composition, as before the pic-
tures, our judgments fluctuated;
we had no laws.

Or perhaps one law, well em-
bodied ln the master that con-
ducted the symphony. We thought
that he, too, must change like the
chameleon age with which he dealt.
And he did change, but not entire-
ly. In the strained granduer of the
Fetes, in the fever of the Waltz,
in the despair of the Nuages, he
kept a certain core of dignity. All
things pervaded him, but nothing

"overwhelmed him. And for us, at
.least, he seemed the only possible

prophet in a lean year—a Marcus
Aurelius of the arts, amazed in a
confused and garbled world--
amazed, but not lost.

HE DOLE ‘is an ubiquitous

expression these days.
Newspaper headlines ﬂash it to
us almost daily; soap box ora-
tors extoll its merits to the
four corners of their vacant
lots, and loaders of American
labor shun it with all the gin-
gerness of a man stepping
away from a hornets nest.

Tomorr ‘w night England is
bringing t e dole to the Pitt

. campus. Two young English-
men, cultured and studious.
will come to --Schenley High
School» to argue over the merits ‘
and demerits of the plan their
country has evolved to aid the
unemployed. Two representa-
tives from the University of
Pittsburgh will endeavor to
prove to them that the disad-
vantages of the dole outweigh
any merits it may possess.

The whole thing promises to
be one of the most attractive,
timely, and interesting debates
in which Pitt will participate
this “ear. The international
aspect of the discussion is ex-
pected to lend color to the
evening and the arguments
should be heard by a represen-
tative audience of students and
faculty members.

This is only the first of a ser-
ies of interesting events prom-
ised by the debating squads. In
previous years, these teams
have become better known,
perhaps, to other schools than
to their own, because of stu-
dent indifference to this activ-
ity on the local campus.

Yet, each year the debate
teams: carry the name of the
University to distant campus-
es. How -many Pitt. students,

Monopoly

Second-hand books are advertised by studehts
in the Alumni Hall. bulletin board at the South
entrance. The tiny cards, with their scrawled
lists of wares, are attached with thumb tacks.
One can purchase everything from economics
and geology books to psychology syllabuses (or
is it syllabi?). While passing on Thursday, we
noted that four ads were on the board. Each
listed a number of books, each gave a ’phone
number and a name to ask for. The names were
Bernie, Ben, Morris, and Isadore. ‘

In the Neck

Sam Strauss, the brunette Adonis who man-
ages the Pitt debating team-, has been the object
of many querulous stares the past week. In-
stead of the usualflowered cravat, tightly knot-
ted about the neck, Sam has been wearing an
expansive Continental scarf around his neck.
Byron had nothing on Sam.'s flaunting neck-
piece! After much--oh, so much-of that old
Weslagerian reportorial ‘ perspicsclty we discov-
ered that Sam was not masquerading for Hal-

Walt Hausler, who played in the Pitt band for
two years, is playing the clarinet for Carnegie
Tech now. Tomorrow you'll see him; he wears
a clarinet so you'll know him. Anyway, what
we’re getting at is this: We always wondered
what sort of clothing the“ Scotch boys wear
under their kilties. Aha! we have learned. If
you were to timidly raise the Tech boys’ kilties
you would see regzular running trousers, -or
“shorts” to you, Chuck Beck! it appears that
long you-know-whats would even disqualify Paul
Whiteman if he wanted to play in the Carnegie
troupe!

Gate Crashers

Believe It or not, one Pittsburgh boy ha's
crashed three Stadium games so far. For the
Pit -W. Va. game he wore a boy scout uniform,
an insisted that his identification card (every
scout must have one that is punched at each
game) disappeared in his shirt pocket when it
(the shirt) was washed; for the Tech-Purdue
game, he crashed the gate wearing old clothes
and carrying a block of ice for the pop vender.
The ice cost ﬁfteen cents; he borrowed a pair of
tongs. For the Tech-Notre Dame game he were
white trousers and a sweater, went in the cheer-
leaders’ entrance early, and borrowed a player’s
hat and overcoat in the dressing room, and sat

in a box seat.

Several of the former campus boys are down
at the Chamber of Commerce Building. Among
the boys who are friends of ours are Leonard
Solomon, John St. Peter, Bob Kleeb, Ted Ep-
stein, and Sam Wein. We felt most important
when we learned that the boys still read this
column. These legal boys are a pun-loving
bunch, and are avid for lousy word twisters.
Well, here's the ultra. The leg student was so
dumb he thought Minnets V. See ens was a brief
