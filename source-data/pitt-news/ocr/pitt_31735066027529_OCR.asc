Campus reactions to the

were a mix of bewilder-
ment, apathy and accep-
tance.

Mother Teresa, the
-world’s most well-known
humanitarian, died of heart
failure Friday afternoon. S

Junior Jesse Cronce was
abrupt when asked to com-
ment on the news coverage
of her death.

“That really sucks,” said
Cronce. “She really did a
lot.”

Jan Grice, who lives in
Shadyside and attends mass
at the Heinz Chapel, wasn’t
shocked by the news of
Mother Teresa’s death.

“I expected it because
she was so ill,” said Grice.
“I don’t find it sad since it’s
a natural progression.”

Mother Teresa had had
lingering heart problems
and recently began wearing

death of Mother Teresa’

a pace maker.

Father Joseph Linck, a
priest living at the Catholic
Newman Center on Bayard
Street, said that some peo-
ple say her death was
expected but doesn’t see
this as a reason not to care.

“The sad thing is, the
world is a poorer place
without her,” he said.

“She’s a great icon for the,

world to see someone really
live out the Gospel.”

Linck continued by say-
ing that based on what he
knows of Mother Teresa,
she wouldn’t want a big
deal to be made about her
death but would prefer oth-
ers to reflect on modeling
their lives after Jesus’.

Junior Joe Bixtman was-
n’t concerned with her
death.

“I really can’t give an
opinion since I didn’t know
much about her,” he said. “I
guess you could say I don’t
care.”

Research reveals ‘Prozac may help with eating disorders

Michelle Singer

Staff Wrlter

Prozac, one of the promi-
nent buzz words of the 90s, is
the Jeckyl and Hyde of drugs.

It is revered by some for
its ability to treat depression
and viewed skeptically by oth-
ers because of its alleged mis-
use by patients and their
physicians.

But now a study at the
University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center’s Western
Psychiatric Institute and
Clinic has revealed that
Prozac can help prevent peo-
ple who have recovered from
anorexia nervosa from falling
back into self-starvation. _

Dr. Walter Kaye, the main
author of the study, and a‘psy-
chiatry professor at Western

Psychiatric, said this
study is very exciting
and promising because
relapses are common
in anorexia.

Kaye said anorexia ner-
vosa is the most deadly psy-
chiatric disorder. It affects
about 0.5 to 1 percent of ado-
lescent and college—age girls.
Rates are much lower in

toms of depression, anxiety,
and obsessive and compulsive
thinking which, according to
research on the topic, may be
linked to irregularities in sero-
tonin. Serotonin is a chemical

in the brain that helps regulate
one's mood and appetite.

It is not known exactly
why Prozac helps with
anorexia. According to this
study, Prozac may work by
stabilizing serotonin systems
in the brain, thus correcting
the changes in brain functions
responsible for symptoms
associated with anorexia.

Dr. Kaye cautions that
Prozac cannot treat the disor-
der itself.

“It will only be effective if
the anorexia patient has been
treated and brought back to a
healthy body weight," he said.

One recovered anorexic
student who has been on
Prozac for the purpose of
helping her maintain a normal
body weight describes it as

BAS dancesinto new year with Indaba celebration

Lisa Grzyboski

Senior Staff Writer

Action, advancement and acade-
mics were the order of the evening
as the Black Action Society hosted
its first major event —of the fall
semester on Friday night. V

As the William Pitt Union ball-
room pulsated with campus minority
students, BAS officials and other
campus leaders welcomed the hun-
dreds gathered to the annual Indaba
celebration.

The Indaba celebration is noth-
ing new to Pitt's black community.
In fact, BAS, the organization
responsible for meeting the needs
and listening to the concerns of
black students on campus, looks at
this annual event as a tradition that

. serves an important purpose.

"The word itself means 'gather-
ing together,'_"..BAS President Aisha‘
Anderson. "The Indaba is an infor-
mal rap session that introduces stu-
dents to the new officers and gives
the freshmen information on BAS
and how they can get involved."

While the Indaba is a great way,

for students to receive information

’ about the BAS and a number of

other campus minority organiza-
tions, it is also a time for black lead-
ers to reinforce the importance of a
college education.

Black officials ranging from

‘BAS to the Student Government

Board stood at the-podium in front
of the bulging crowd and urged
them to study, work hard and
become actively involved on cam-
pus. They also encouraged everyone
to help others succeed whenever
possible. ,

"We have to become more
responsible for our actions’ by study-
ing and going to class and speaking
with our professors during office
hours," said BAS, Vice President
Harry Mudd. "We _have to start
thinking about helping others in the
class because if I get an ‘A’ but
everyone else gets a 'D,"then we all

have lost. If we help someone else,

then everyone wins." .
Personal responsibility, and the
responsibility of understanding the

. larger issues at hand, remained at

the heart of thenumerous speeches
and remarks made throughout the

evening. - *

- "There are still people at this
University who think that we don't
belong here," said Ralph
Dunneihigh, community relations
co—chair for SGB. "They think that
we are here because someone felt

sorry for us. We have to show that

we can do the work and succeed."
There was an invitation to pro-

mote the ideals of affirmative action
around campus, along with invita-
tions to attend study sessions and
African—culture discussion groups.
Affirmative action is a measure
adopted in recent decades to com-
pensate for past or present discrimi-
nation, and prevent future discrimi-

nation by allowing employers and

university admissions offices to
consider race as a factor when mak-
ing hiring or admissions decisions.

With affirmative action under
siege by state and federal public
officials, BAS leaders felt it was
pertinent to present black students
with information on how_ to become
involved in the fight for its preser-
vation.

Guest speaker William Savage,
assistant to the chancellor and direc-
tor of affirmative action at Pitt, told
students that- affirmative action
could be discarded as early as next
year if minorities don't make the
effort to support it.

"There are many white people
who don't agree with affirmative
action, but studies show that there
are many minorities who don't sup-

port it as well," he said. "This is.

because people are misinformed as
to what it is exactly."
He went on to say that affirma-

tive action is not about quotas that -

force employers or universities to
accept a certain number of women
and minorities. Instead, it is a policy
that gives women and minorities the
equal opportunity to participate in
jobs and receive education previ-
ously unavailable to them.

Savage later urged the audience
members to write to their state lead-

 

ers and national congressmen con-

cerning the issue. He also urged the

crowd to uncover the truth behind
the political rhetoric. _

The Indaba is viewed as more
than only an informational meeting.
This is due to the wide variety of
speakers and different
groups, such as the Black Dance
Workshop and the National Society
for Black Engineers, who participat-
ed. It is more commonly accepted as
a community celebration.

"People tend to enjoy it a lot
because this is the first time they get

' to meet the leaders and see many of

theirfriends," Anderson said. "The
freshmen also benefit because they
can get to know upperclassmen and
see that there are black students in
leadership positions on campus."

Based on the noise level in the
ballroom, combined with the fre-
quent cries of excited greetings and
the animated conversations between
college friends, it appeared as if
everyone was taking full advantage
of the "meet and greet" aspect of the
event _

, "BAS helps to make black stu-
dents feel almost as if they have a
family on campus," said freshman
Shaun Huff. "I feel less isolated and
more a part of something." -

The idea of "feeling a part 0
something" made sophomore Justin
Strong renew his bonds with BAS
this year.

"This is a nice event to get
everyone together again," he said.
"This is the first time that I've seen
a lot of the friends I made last year
since I've been back to school. I'm
living off campus this year and I'm
working, and things like this help
me to see people I normally would-
n't see again."

He said

Hurricane in Puerto Rico
reaches winds of 105 mph

SAN FRANCISCO — The San
Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit
System will remain stalled for the
Monday commute.

Talks between striking transit
workers and transit officials broke
off this afternoon after three hours.
No new talks are scheduled.

The 2,600 workers walked off
the job early this morning. The tran-
sit system normally carries 275,000
riders on weekdays.

Officials are urging commuters
to carpool, take buses or ferries, or
just stay home on Monday.

Extra toll takers will be called in
to work at the San Francisco-
Oakland Bay Bridge.

NEW YORK — If you got up early
or stayed up late to watch at least
some of Princess Diana’s funeral on
television, you weren’t alone.

The American networks esti-
mate that 50 million people in the
United States tuned in to live cover-
age of the funeral early Saturday.

That would be less than the 58
million people who watched Diana
marry Prince Charles in 1981.

While NBC and ABC ran neck
and neck in attracting viewers for
the funeral, the Nielsen media
research numbers were disturbing
for CBS. It was a distant third
among the broadcast networks, and
may have come in behind CNN.

The numbers are based on an
overnight sampling in 38 major
markets, representing more than
half of the nation’s viewers.
Complete Nielsen numbers will be
available later this week.

CBS’ rating may be a remnant of
the network’s slowness in breaking

the news about Diana’s death the
night of August 30.

SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico —
Hurricane Erika is whipping up 10-
to 15-foot—high waves that are bat-
tering the northeastern shores of
Puerto Rico.

The National Weather Service
says an increase in swells could
force the evacuation of several
coastal areas in and around San
Juan. But authorities have canceled
a hurricane watch as Erika turns
north, away from the Caribbean.

It was sustaining winds of 105
miles per hour, centered about 245
miles northeast of San Juan.

The Virgin Islands have been
getting some heavy rain, but storm
watchers say Erika’s damaging edge
is mainly over the open Atlantic.

CALCUTTA, India — Mother
Teresa’s funeral will be held at a
stadium where Pope John Paul II
once spoke when he visited India in
1986.

There will be room for 10,000
mourners at the indoor stadium
where the Roman Catholic nun’s
state funeral will take place.

The Nobel Peace Prize winner is
now lying in state at a Calcutta
church. The mourners have included
the prime minister, a former Miss
Universe, Indian movie stars and
barefoot paupers.

Prime Minister I.K'. Gujral com-
pared Mother Teresa to Mohandas
Gandhi. He says India had Gandhi
in the first half of the century to
lead the fight against poverty,
hunger and injustice; and in the sec-
ond half, it had Mother Teresa.

MOTHER TERESA

Some people were upset by the
media’s coverage on Mother
Teresa’s death.

“It’s pretty sad. I can still only

‘find video coverage of Princess

Diana,” said Daniel Anderson, of
Squirrel Hill. “All the magazine
covers last week were of Diana, and
now they should be of Mother
Teresa, but they’ll be of Diana
again.”

When sophomore Mark Black
was asked about his reaction to her
death, he replied, “Mother Teresa
died?”

Black said that he thought he
would have heard about her death if
it was getting proper coverage.

FROM PAGE 1

“How could I go a whole day
and not know?” he asked. “Maybe
the reporters should get off the
whole Di thing.”

Senior Michael McCoy said he
thought the coverage of Mother
Teresa's death was adequate.-

“She would probably want to
keep it low key anyway,” he said.

Father Joseph Linck agreed, but
added that even though it was a
small media event, her death affect-
ed a lot of people.

“It affects [college students]
since everyone all knew her,” he
said. “Everyone knew at least some-
thing about her life and the good she
did.”

the reason she is able to lead a rel-
atively normal life.

“Before I recovered, I would
eat a carrot or some lettuce, and
then go running for miles. At my
worst, I was down to
60 pounds,” she said.
“I still have good days
and bad days, but this
medicine has really
made a difference. It
takes away a lot of the
obsessive thoughts
and [the] need to
always be perfect that
I tend to have when I
am not using it."

Researchers in
this study agree that
Prozac will probably
work best for anorexi-
cs who are depressed,
anxious, obsessive or
compulsive. This
group that represents at least half
of all anorexia patients.

Doctors and researchers are
striving every day to learn more
about eating disorders.

Dr. Kaye suggested that there
may be a logical genetic predispo-
sition toward eating disorders.
Research so far has shown that
people with eating disorders most
often have personalities that

She said

include perfectionist, anxious,
self—doubting and insecurity traits.

In this study, Dr. Kaye and his
colleagues followed 35 outpatients
for one year who were discharged
from the hospital
after they regained a
significant amount
of their body
weight. Prozac was
prescribed for 16 of
the patients, while
the remainder took a
placebo.

Among the patients
on Prozac, 10 of 16
did not relapse and
maintained a
healthy body
weight, while only
three out of the’ 19
on the placebo were
successful in doing
so. ‘

“It is important to recognize
that Prozac is not a medical cure
for the eating disorder,” said Dr.
Kaye. “We still have a long way to
go. Anorexia nervosa is a c-hronic
and dangerous disorder, but once
patients make it to a healthy body
weight, a medication that helps
them maintain it outside of the
hospital and prevent relapse may
ultimately save lives."

Sit-ins on Bigelow ought to work

Why don’t people care

about important things?

Last week, a vicious circle was created: The media ﬂood-
ed readers and viewers with ongoing coverage of Princess
Diana’s death; Readers and viewers took to it like nothing
since the O.J. Simpson trial; And the media responded with,
you guessed it, more Diana coverage.

In fact, newspapers made news of her death more promi-
nent on their pages than any other news event this week —
more prominent, even, than things that we think deserved
greater coverage, like Israel ofﬁcially ending a peace accord
with the Palestinians. 

This is an important piece of news, but its headline in a
certain local newspaper was about half the size of a headline
earlier that week announcing Diana’s death. The end of this
peace accord is signaling the possibility of many, perhaps
hundreds, of deaths in the foreseeable future, and yet our
media, at the insistence of its readers, exhibits this story as if
it were far less important.

Something is seriously wrong with our priorities.

We’ve given all our attention to events which will prob-
ably have no real effect whatsoever on our lives, but we treat
them as if they were the most important events of the centu-

. A great many important things go on in the world, and ' I

just because you don’t know how they affect you doesn’t
mean that they don’t affect you. Just because there’s no pret-
ty color photograph to go with the story doesn’t make it
unimportant.

The job of a newspaper should be to provide readers with
information to help them live their lives, information to help
readers process what they see in this world. But the coverage

after Diana’s death is not education, it’s entertainment, and-

that is not the responsibility of a good newspaper. Perhaps

_ when one has a circulation of more than 50,000, the only

thing one cares about is selling newspapers, and not educat-
ing one’s readers. But capitalizing on Diana’s death makes
those newspapers no better than the supermarket tabloids that
everybody is complaining about.

But we can hardly put all the blame on the media. After
all, it is the readers who have told the newspapers what they
want to see.

It is time to examine our priorities and to decide what is
really important to us.

Cel|ine-
Atavera V
I am beginning to take this
whole matter of Bigelow
Boulevard personally.
Before this morning, I didn’t.
That was before I was almost run

over by an angry motorist who
decided to put the laws of physics
to the test and accelerate into a
group of jaywalking college stu-
dents (including me), causing us
to dive for the nearest sidewalk.

' It’s one thing to have to deal with

the aggravation of waiting for
walk signals when you’re already
late for class, but it is a complete-
ly diﬂerent thing to have some-
one deliberately attempt to kill
you. , _

Even after this traumatic inci-
dent, I was still trying to be open-
minded. As I was waiting for the
elevator at the Cathedral, I even
tried to look at it from that jerk’s,
I mean, that d1iver’s point of
view. After all, maybe he was late
for work, or maybe he was tired
of dealing with 12,000 college
students perpetually crossing
Bigelow, which, technically, he
has the right to drive on. Yet my
attempts to view the incident
from an objective perspective
only convinced me even more
that the University’s endeavor to
close Bigelow; was more justiﬁed
than I had realized.

I am not talking about this
latest asinine scheme of making
Bigelow only two lanes of trafﬁc
and using taxes to pay for it. I am
talking about completely, 112

percent closing it permanently,-

and having the University pay for
it. Hell, we could even plant trees
and grass and all that other great

stuff there. The only problem is
that We’ve already seen the results
of what happens when the idea is
presented to the City Council.
Two eons of bureaucratic red tape
until someone comes up with the
idea to close it only part way, and
then, even that motion gets tabled.
(Oh, wait, I just had a brainstorm:

Why don’t we alternately open or-

close it every 15 minutes? That
way, everybody’s an idiot.)

So, it looks like we’re going
nowhere fast. The city simply will
not acquiesce to the University’s
wishes. This leaves us with three
choices: 1) give up on the idea of
closing Bigelow; 2) continue to
work with the City Council and

‘hope that a mutually beneﬁcial

arrangement can been reached
before global warming _actually
becomes a serious problem; or 3)
do things my way.

Since this is my column, 3) is
obviously going to be the right
choice. I’ve come up with a won-

derful solution to the Bigelow.

dilermna. Since the city won’t let
us do something they don’t want,
we have to make them want to
close Bigelow. All we have to do
to achieve this objective is make
it more inconvenient to drive on
Bigelow than to use another
avenue. At first, this presented a
problem, until I thought of some
of the demonstrations and the sit-
ins of the late sixties, and the
answer was revealed to me: Have
large numbers of students stand
(or sit) around on Bigelow so that
cars would be unable to travel on
it. However ignorant. some

I Pittsburgh drivers may be, I tend

to think most would still be reluc-
tant to plow cold-bloodedly

through a large group of people.

‘THE PITT NEWS

Within a month, I guarantee that
people will have completely
given up even attempting to drive
on Bigelow.

Some skeptics still may not
be convinced of the great wisdom
and simplicity of my idea. They
might ask where I plan to get so
many people to just stand around
in the middle of the street. After
all, we have places to be and
classes to attend. Yet this is the
best part. I have several ideas
where to get the manpower. The
Campus Fools (Pitt juggling club)
could use Bigelow as a practice
area. Everyone waving credit-
card applications in front of the
WPU could be moved a couple of
feet directly into the middle of
Bigelow. Fratemities and sorori-
ties could use it for their rush
booths. At night, we could use it
as a concert or party venue. Pitt
could form a Frisbee club. And
last, but not least, all the people
from the Ashcan (i.e. the patio
behind the Towers) could walk a
little further down to Bigelow to
smoke. I know it’s a sacriﬁce, but
what’s a short walk in an effort to
better the University? That group
alone could probably stop traﬂic
not only on Bigelow but on Fifth
and Forbes as well. ‘

_ So there is a solution, and all
it requires is a little team effort
and some good ol’-fashioned,
I’m-a—col1ege-student-and-you-
can’t-stop-me—from-doing—what-
ever—I-damn—well-please attitude.
You never know — maybe a few
more riots could help make Pitt a
better place.

Celline Atavera is a freshman and
is already fed up with University
red tape.

Nukes are no longer an important strategic weapon

Michael Berquist

Columnlst

There has been much talk over the

last few months about the frightening
possibility of renegade groups hostile to
the United States gaining control of
nuclear weapons. President Clinton
remarked in a 1993 speech before the
U.N. General Assembly, “If we do not
stem proliferation of the world’s dead-
liest weapons, no democracy can feel
safe.” Thanks to the hard work of the
Clinton administration, no nuclear
weapons have managed to fall into hos-
tile hands, but there might be a time in the
not-so-distant future when our luck runs
out.

Last year, Gen. Lee Butler, the for-
mer commander of the U.S. strategic
command — America’s nulcear arsenal
— and former NATO Commander Gen.
Andrew Goodpastor issued a joint state-
ment that stunned the world’s military
and foreign-policy establishments. Gen.
Goodpastor. and Gen. Butler argued,
“The roles of nuclear weapons for pur-
poses of security have been sharply nar-
rowed in terms of the security of the
United States. Now and in the future they
basically provide an option to respond in
kind to a nuclear threat or nuclear attack
by others  they are not needed against

‘ non-nuclear opponents.” When it comes

to nuclear weapons, Gen. Butler

observed that everyone

“becomes -

enthralled. It’s time to break the spe .”

Their seemingly bold statement real-
ly ought not to be such a radical idea.
Gen. Charles A. Homer, the commanding
ofﬁcer of U.S. Space Command, told a
group of reporters, “The nuclear weapon
is obsolete. I want to get rid of them all.”

Gen. Butler noted that his former
colleagues are “frantically casting about
for a new rationale for nuclear weapons.”
The fact is that there isn’t one. I agree that
we ought to dramatically reduce the num-
ber of nuclear weapons in our arsenal,
and we ought to do everything in our
power to_ encourage Russia to do the
same. It’s time for the armies of
Armageddon to stand down.

The United States today has an
undisputed superiority in conventional
and nuclear weaponry. We currently have
more than 7,000 nuclear warheads pro-
grarnrned to armihilate targets in Russia,
a number that experts say is more than 10
times the number needed to perform the
task adequately. U.S. diplomat George
Kennan argued during the Cold War that
nuclear weapons are f‘superﬂuous to our
basic military posture — as something
we are compelled to hold against the pos-
sibility that they might be used by our
opponents.” Today, that assessment is
correct. '

Huge nuclear arsenals simply don’t
provide the same security they once did.
The wars of the future will not look any-
thing like the Persian Gulf War. They will

likely more closely resemble something
like Bosnia, where antagonists are lightly
armed and ﬁght in treacherous terrain,
and the distinctions between ally and
enemy are difﬁcult at best to distinguish.
In such a war, no one will care what the
size of our nuclear arsenal might be. Such
a factor will be irrele-
vant.

Those who argue
that we ought to keep
our arsenal out of the
fear that Russia could
soon revert to commu-
nist dictatorship fail to
understand that the
United States pays a
price for our inﬂexibili-
ty. Those who want the
United States to main-
tain our massive nuclear arsenal against
the possibility of a renewed Russian
threat may end up ushering in a second
Cold War because of their stubbornness.
They do little more than anger.national-
ists in Moscow and supply Boris
Yeltsin’s right-wing critics with ammuni-
tion to use. in their campaigns. Better to
have a reformer like Yeltsin in Moscow
than a Russian nationalist bent on restor-
ing Russia to the days of the USSR.

’ VVith the loss of its satellite states in
Eastern Europe and the reductions in the
size of its conventional military forces, a
security-obsessed Russia increasingly
considers its nuclear arsenal as its ﬁrst

He said i

 

line of defense from attack. ‘ 9

Russia has repeatedly warned the

world that it would “launch on warning”
rather than risk the possibility of a first
strike taking out its arsenal.

Alarmingly, former Russian Defense
Minister -Igor Rodianov recently admit-
ted that the Russian
Govemment’s authori-
ty over its nuclear arse-
nal is less than perfect
and that its command-
and-control systems

lete. In 1995, an
' atmospheric-research
rocket launched from

Russian radar opera-
tors to alerttheir com-
manders that a nuclear attack was under
way. President Yeltsin and his generals
were in the process of activating nuclear-
launch codes when they realized what the
rocket actually was and then stood down.
Next time we may not be so lucky.

President Clinton has made it clear
that he wishes to begin work on his lega-
cy now in his second term, and I think
that one of the ways in which he can do
so is working toward eliminating the
threat that nuclear weapons pose to the
rest of the world.

iMicha'el Berquist thinks that we should
get rid of the bomb.

journalism

One would hope that a
journalist would be a little
more objective in the way that
he covers a story, rather than
succumbing to the politically
correct view of demonizing the
police. The reporter covering
the rriiniriot on Forbes last
Sunday [24 August] claimed
that both University and city
police used excessive force in
clearing away the people that
were on Forbes Avenue in front
of Club Laga, and then inter-
viewed an ofﬁcer of the Black
Action Society, who was not
even present at the incident, to
support the claim. He then
went on to make the incident a
racial matter, which it was not.

I am in a unique position to
give a distinctly different view
of what happened because I am
an administration-of-justice
major, have worked with both
University and city police

before, and I am a bouncer at
Club Laga. Security for the
event consisted of ﬁve door-
men and five city police ofﬁ-
cers. People began lining up at
5 p.m. for the event, which was
not scheduled to start until 9
p.m., and by 8 p.m. there was a
huge mass of people waiting to
get in, blocking the sidewalk
and interfering with traffic,
despite our attempts to direct
the crowd in an orderly fash-
ion. People were pushing and
shoving to get closer to the
doors, and when we ﬁnally
opened them the pushing only
got worse. Several times, a
group of us would have to push
out into the crowd in a concert-
ed effort, so as to help some-
one who was being crushed
against the door or a wall. If
the crowd had acted like civi-
lized human beings rather than

a pack of rabid animals, there I

would not have been a prob-
lem.

I also think it was irrespon-
sible of the reporter to “play
the race card.” The incident
had more to do with the music
and the type of people that the
music attracts. For example,
the previous Friday Laga host-
ed a live hip-hop show featur-
ing Strict F.L.O.W., and the
message being passed was one
of unity and peace. We did not
have one problem‘ that entire
night, and because things ‘went
so well, we stayed open an
extra two hours. Contrast that
to the songs on Sunday, which

were about “bitches and
money.”
To further defuse the myth

that these were just a bunch of
kids looking to have some fun,
in the short amount of time that

.a.-

  

night, numerous people were
ejected for drug use, underage
drinking and fighting.
Furthermore, the reason why it
took so long for people to enter
the club was because we had to
search each and every person
who came in. The previous
week, at an event sponsored by
the same promoters, we had
conﬁscated numerous weapons
consisting mostly of pepper
spray and knives.

Hopefully, in the future,
when covering a story that
could potentially hurt the repu-
tation of many groups of peo-
ple, journalists will do a little
more research and conduct a
few more interviews than was
evidenced in The Pitt News
article.

Pitt tradition

The removal of the script ‘ 'tt”
from the helmet of the football
unifonn is an outright crime. That
logo was unique, it had character
and was very recognizable. To
take that logo is to take every-
thing ﬂie football team stands for.

Players such as Marino, _Dorsett,'

Green and Martin played under
such a logo. Players make the
uniform, uniform does not make
the player, or for that matter a
coach or an athletic director. The
new logo on the helmet has the
look of an-NFL expansion team
— a team that lacks character or
tradition. Great programs like
Alabama and even Penn State do
not change uniforms, but I guess I
should expect this lack of class
out of Pitt’s athletic director; after
all, he showed up at the Pitt-
Duquesne basketball game in a

warm-up suit.

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. — “O—ver-ra-
 O-ver-ra-ted... O-ver-ra-ted.”

That wonderful four-syllable chant
was heard above anything the 90,000 or
more Penn State fans had to say at the end
of the game on Saturday.

It was truly an amazing spectacle.
There was Pitt, in Penn State’s house, at
the end of a 34-17 loss, and it was Pitt’s
fans who were heard cheering at the end of
the game. The Nittany fans must have had
other things on their minds:

0 1. We didn’t beat Pitt by enough points to
keep our bogus preseason No. 1 rating. ,
0 2. We didn’t cover the spread by 15
points, so I just lost some dough.

'0 3. We have no chance of winning a
national championship with this team.

The blue-and-white faithful were
pissed off after the game. They expected a
60-0 blowout, but instead were deﬂated by
a 34-17 win. 1

They actually booed Joe Patemo’s
decision to down the ball with under a
minute in the game, instead of trying to
score a “looks good on paper” touchdown.

So, instead of cheering for the victory,
these Penn Staters, who have a reputation
as some of the best fans in college football,
booed their icon for not putting one up
with 32 seconds left in the game.

That’s loyalty.

Or maybe they are remembering the
1995 controversy, when they lost the No. 1
ranking late in the season because Indiana
scored on a last—second Hail Mary that cut

State’s margin of victory to six. State went ‘

undefeated, but lost the national title to a
ﬂawless Nebraska.

Well, they would have a valid point,
except that this year Penn State was best
described by Pitt’s tiny, but vociferous,
crowd.

With a carrot-topped local product at
quarterback and a preseason No. 1 rank-
ing, the Lions have all the reasons to
choke: _

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. — It is
tremendously difficult to enter a
game when no one gives you a
chance to win. With everyone from
the armchair quarterback to- the
opposing coach giving you no
chance, it’s easy for a player’s
confidence to shrink below mea-
surable levels.

Unfortunately for Pitt fans, the
Panthers have entered the majority
of their games in the 90s as over-

When Pitt traveled to Happy
Valley to battle No. 1-ranked Penn
State this. weekend, the game
looked tobe anything but a joyous

an encouraging 45-13 victory in
their season opener, the Panthers
entered the game as over-30-point

mighty Nittany Lions and the
immortal Joe Paterno that the
Panthers would leave State
College quietly with their tails
tucked firmly between their legs.

Yet despite the gaudy point
spread and the potential for the
game to be a blowout special-, Pitt
played admirably in a 34-17 loss to
the Nittany Lions. Whilea 17-
point loss to a team is rarely seen
as impressive, the loss_ has the
potential to be an uplifting experi-
ence for the Panthers.

Pitt soccer wins one, ties one at theOneontcr Mayor’s Cup

Rachel Lenzi

Staff Wrlter

Someone once said that a tie is
sort of like kissing your sister. But
kissing the ugly sister also means
sharing the tournament champi-
onship, if you’re the University of
Pittsburgh men’s soccer team.

After defeating the Oneonta
State Red Dragons on Saturday, the
Panthers fought to a 2-2 tie against
Hartwick College on Sunday to earn
a share of the Oneonta Mayor’s Cup
title in upstate New York. In addi-
tion, Pitt midfielder Drew Kopp
earned tournament Offensive MVP
honors in the victorious weekend.

On Saturday, the Panthers came
from behind to defeat Oneonta State
4-2 to advance to the championship.
Oneonta State jumped out to a 2-1
lead in the first half of the game
when Dexter Davis opened up scor-
ing early, tallying five minutes into
the game. But Pitt was quick to
answer, as freshman Spencer Barton
scored less than four minutes later
to tie the match.

The Red Dragons regained the
lead near the end of the first half
when Mike D’Arpino scored, but
junior forward Phil Matilla turned
the tide for the Panthers in the sec-
ond half, notching two goals less
than 10 minutes apart to give

Pittsburgh the ensuing lead. Drew

Kopp added an insurance goal at '

42:55 of the half to help ensure the
win.
On Sunday, the Panthers faced
off against Hartwick for the
Mayor’s Cup championship brag-
ging rights, and after a 90-minute
draw, both teams went home brag-
ging.

Hartwick took the early lead, as
Nick Miles drilled a pass from
Orest Grechka past Pitt goalkeeper
Chris Hanlon at 24:55 of the first
half. Then, Hartwick’s Liam
Hefferman took advantage of an
errant clear by Hanlon at the top of
the crease and sent in the second

rI‘i Inc

Hartwick goal.

The Panthers weren’t going
down without .a fight, however.
Kopp started the Panther rally by
directing a free kick past the left of
Hartwick goalie Pete Doneit, who
finished the game with four saves.
But Phil Matilla did it again, notch-
ing the tying-goal 10 minutes into
the second half of the game to
clinch the tie.

With 14 seconds left in the
game, Kopp literally took one last
shot at the victory, but his scoring
attempt at point-blank range
skimmed off the top crossbar.
However, Kopp’s final effort helped
him earn MVP honors.

Because the team was traveling
home last night, no team members
or coaches could be reached for
comment.

The Panthers’ season record
stands at 1-0-2. They travel to West
Virginia on Wednesday and to
Providence on Saturday, then return
home on Sept. 20 to face Boston
College.

PSU

Under a new athletic
administration, Pitt desper-
ately desires to eventually
reach the level of play that
Penn State is noted for. Its
goal is to be comparable to
Penn State, not just in one
game each year, but also in
recruiting and eventually
establishing a nationally
prominent program.

Any college football fan
will notice the discrepan-
cies that currently exist
between the two teams. In
his postgame interview,
Coach Walt Harris even
stressed the point that Pitt
cannot compete with Penn
State on the field until it
can also compete with the
Lions in recruiting.

“Until we start beating
them in recruiting, [it’s]
hard to beat them on the

was a considerable step in
the right direction for the
Panther football team both
on the field and in increas-
ing respectability, the key
factor in recruiting.

Pitt did not win. It did
not physically overpower
Penn State.

But the Panthers
showed a lotmore fight
than what was expected.
They showed they have
spunk, that they will not
back down to _a higher-
ranked opponent.

Pitt is going to enter at
least four of its remaining
contests as heavy under-
dogs. Both Coach Harris
and his players stressed the
fact that Pitt will not be
intimidated by its ‘oppo-
nents. The Panthers’ play
proved that they will not
simply concede victory.

instead that no loss can be
seen as a victory of any
kind.

Call it what you like,
Coach, but when- you
accepted the Pitt job, your
major hurdle was to
improve a team that under-
standably lacked confi-
dence —— a lack that was
associated with not having
a winning season in six
years.

Barely losing to the
nation’s top team is a moral
victory because it will sure-
ly improve this team’s out-
look for the remaining nine
games.

So, the Panthers were
able to turn the tables on
Penn State. Instead of being
a ballot booster for the
nation’s top—ranked team,

 A FROM PAGE 10

State and Michigan do?

One of two things happened on
Saturday: Either Penn State isn’t the No. 1
team in the nation, or Pitt is better than
anyone expected. ‘

At times, PSU looked like the No. 1
team in the country and Pitt, well, looked
like the same old Pitt.

After holding Penn State to a ﬁeld
goal on its opening drive, Pitt quarterback
Pete Gonzalez was picked off, giving the
Lions prime ﬁeld position. They promptly
scored, igniting the “We are Penn State”
chants. Whoever said Penn Staters weren’t
creative?

It looked like the same old Pitt team
that lost 72-0 to Ohio State last year. After
the resulting kickoff sailed ﬁve yards out
of the end zone, Pitt started a drive. Three

 

plays and a punt, and this game could be ‘

over in the first quarter.

On third and ﬁve, a spinning, crawling
Dwayne Schulters barely reached the ﬁrst—
down marker in front of the Pitt sideline.

Then, freshman fullback Tony
Thompson busted through the line for 13
yards and another first down, moving the
ball to Pitt’s 44-yard line.

Two first downs, and the Penn State
defense was confused by Walt Harris’ ver-
sion of the West Coast offense. Before
Penn State could stabilize, Gonzales hit
tight end John Jones on a crossing route in
Penn State territory for 22 yards.

Freshman Cheo Angel converted
another. third down on a slant pattern, and
three plays later, Terry Murphy hauled in a
Gonzalez pass at Penn State’s two—yard
line. '

‘Are you kidding me?

It is nearing the end of the first quarter
and Pitt, yes Pitt, is on the doorstep of
Penn State’s end zone looking‘ to pull with-
in three points. ' ‘

This was a game, for now, against the’
best team in the country. -

Pitt didn’t score on this drive, and
missed opportunities plagued it all day
long. A dropped pass by Teny Murphy and
an incomp1ete—pass call on a Jake Hoffart

catch (replays proved it was a catch ——, it’s

a shame they don’t count) made a differ-
ence, but not enough to change the out-
come of the game.

Saturday’s game was ‘a combination
of two things:

1. Pitt is better than its No. 80-some-
thing preseason ranking.

2. Penn State isn’t No. 1.

The ideal consequences of this game
would be another late-season fall in the
rankings by Penn State because it only
beat Pitt by 17, and the Panthers’ making a
bowl because they put up 17 points on the
then No. 1 team in the country.

And maybe, just maybe, we could
then chant “We are Pitts-burgh!”

No. We’ll stick with “P-E-N- -S—T
SUCKS.”

Matt Townsend is the assistant sports edi-
tor of The Pitt News.

and again on a vicious hit by end Courtney
Brown. Gonzalez’s hit total was much
higher, for he got the helmet of a PSU line-
backer or defensive end put under his chin
or into his back after nearly every pass.

Asked to comment on a toss dropped
by Terry Murphy, who appeared to have
an open lane to the end zone, the quarter-
back said, “the view I saw was all grass
and legs. I didn’t see it.” p

The drop came when Penn State was
leading the game 10-3, and represented
the Panthers’ best chance of tying the
score in the contest. It was not, however,
the only missed opportunity that could
have made the game even more competi-
tive.

In the ﬁrst quarter, after throwing
three passes and making his only comple-
tion to at Penn State defensive back,
Gonzalez settled down and started his
offense on a long march from its own 20.

V Dwayne Schulters earned a ﬁrst down

with 11 yards on the dn've’s ﬁrst three car-
ries. Freshman fullback Tony Thompson,
subbing for the oft-injured Chris
Schneider, turned a dive play into a 13-
yard ﬁrst down.

Then, John Jones —— Pitt’s tight end
with a reputation for dropping passes —
made‘ a difﬁcult (and unexpected) one-
handed catch for 22 yards and another
ﬁrst. 1

After two short rushes, Gonzalez hit

Cheo Angel for 12 yards. A screen to
Thompson and a dive by Schulters
equaled another first.

This time though, it was ﬁrst and goal
at the PSU nine.

play, setting up a third and four from the
four. 1

Gonzalez rolled right to_ start the play,
looked off two receivers, and appeared to
pull down the ball and prepare to rim for
glory. '

Then, he caught a PSU linebacker out
of the corner of his eye and thought differ-
ently. He ﬁred a sidearm toss incomplete,
and wished he hadn’t.

“It seemed as though they had an
angle,” Gonzalez said, referring to PSU
defenders on the play. “I think I should
have just put my shoulder down and ran it
in. I don’t know what I was thinking.”

Gonzalez’s decision wasn’t the last to
go against the Panthers. Down 17-3 with
under two minutes left in the second quar-
ter, Pitt’s Jeff McCurley recovered a PSU
fumble and set up the oﬂ°ense on the Pitt
46.

A delay penalty moved it back to the
41. Gonzalez’s screen to Schulters recov-
ered the penalty yardage, but his quick
pass to Jake Hoffart fell incomplete.

On third and nine, another pass to

_ Hoﬁart was ruled incomplete. Hoﬁart was

positioned a few yards
past the ﬁrst-down
marker, and dropped
to the ground in an
attempt to make the
catch. He was unable,

Pitt was forced to
punt, and Penn State
added a ﬁeld goal to
take a 20-3 halftime
lead. .

Enis and tight end
Joe Nastasi added
touchdowns for PSU
in the third quarter,
making the score 34-3.
Lytle, who entered the
game after Gonzalez
threw his second inter-
ception, drove Pitt 35
yards in 38 seconds for its ﬁrst touchdown
of the contest.

Penn State was forced to punt after
three plays, and Pitt started fresh at its own
28. A pass-interference penalty and a Lytle
pass to Ramel Johnson put the ball on the
PSU 43. An incompletion and a quarter-
back draw brought up third and two, when
Pittsburgh native LaVar Arrington crushed
Lyﬂe for a six-yard loss.

‘ On fourth and eight, a visibly dazed
Lytle hit Johnson for a 16-yard comple-
tion. After an incompletion, Lytle scram-

On the play, Penn Sta'te’s Askari
Adams tackled Lytle by hammering him
in the right shoulder, sending the quarter-
back into a spin and causing him to land
on the Beaver Stadium grass right-shoul-
der ﬁrst. The southpaw quarterback, winc-
ing, attempted to re-enter the contest, but
was replaced by Gonzalez. A six-yard toss
to Billy West and an eight-yard touch-
down pass to Johnson ended the day’s
scoring. 1
