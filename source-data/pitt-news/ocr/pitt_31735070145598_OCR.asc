Group ’s adviser steps down as Pitt ojjicial denies pressuring Students for a Democrcitic Society to cancel weekend conference

News Editors

Student activists decided‘ yesterday
not-to host a conference this weekend
after receiving alleged pressure troma
University official 0

“The University made it clear that
they didn’t advocate what we’re do-
ing, and ﬁ'om what I understand, they
more or less wanted us to cancel the
event. And I agree with them,”Jordan

Romanus, manager of Students for a

A Democratic Society, said.

SDS, which also lost its adviser
yesterday, seeks to “provide a bridge
between students and the larger com-
munity in which they live, in a way

that fosters activism and mutual aid’

across the traditional borders, such as

' gender, sexuality, color or class,” ac-

cording to the Student Organization
Resource Center website. The group
holds anti—war ﬁlm screenings, brings
speakers —likeanti—war activist Mark

Rudd — and teaches basics of nonvio-
lent activism. g

Romanus said hetalkedto two Uni-
versity administrators, one ofthem be-
ingPittDirectorofSt11dentLife Kenyon
Bonner and another whose name he
said he couldn’trecal1. _ .

Bonner said Pitt student Eric Lang-
berg e-mailedboth St11dentAil'airs and

- berg wrote an amide for PittBrieﬂy

raising concerns that the conference,
also dubbed the Pittsburgh Freedom

School, would teach interactions with.

Bonner said he was investigatin

‘facilities appropriately.

He e-maﬂed the executive board of
SDS, and Romanus called Bonner to
discuss the event. Bonner said that he
spoke to Romanus,butdid notpnessure
anyone to cancel. the event.

_ That afternoon, Romanus canceled
the room requests that the group had

placed for the conference.

History professor Tony Novosel
stepped down as the group’s adviser
yesterday, leaving its existence in lirn—
bo. He said one ofhis friends e-mailed
him a link to a PittBrieﬂy article with
a recording of an interview with SDS
members and other people planning
the event. A

“When I heard the PittBrieﬂy in-
terview, I couldn’t really be‘ involved

The beardless and the brave

  
  

‘Keith Gillogly
- Opinions Editor

Most mornings, I follow a fairly
typical routinezyswish around a lit-
tle mouthwash, take a shower, ﬁnd

. "some clothes and -have breakfast.

But where does shaving ﬁt into that
equation? For me, it’s not a daily
event, and that’s not because I pre-
fer to sport a scruffy mug. A
I’ve been a beardless boy wonder
for 21 years now, and I’m starting to
lose hope. Beards are stylish, rug-

ged and cool. ButI can’t grow one, .

and I just can’t ﬁnd complacency in
my smooth-skinned state.

Having such docile hair follicles
means cutting costs on shaving
cream and aftershave, and it means
fewer bloody nicks from razors.
Sure, it’s alsoa real time saver. Even
when I do shave, it’s simply a matter
of clearing the speckles of dirt from
my upper lip and chin. Facial hair
ﬁrst appears at the corners of the
upper lip and then spreads across
it. One of the last places facial hair
shows up is along the sides of the

 r _ .~*~a-,.»...¢-4~“"""R-m-I-.«_.,.a.<.-c or

face. So maybe there’s still hope,

right?

Yet my scant 5 o’clock shadow

rolls in more than a few hours late, if

it chooses to show up at all. I’ve had
an electric pocket razor since high

school —. I’ve never had to change V

the batteries. Those guys who wake
up every morning, drudge to the
bathroom sink, lather on the shav-
-ing cream and swipe and swipe and
swipe call me lucky. I disagree.
Lacking a beard is the facial
equivalent of a school uniform. It
limits a mode ofself-expression and
personal style. The wearer has no
choice, but to give off an appear-
ance that’s neat and rather bland.
And people will always think you’re
stillin high school.-If I ever hope to
‘become awise old man —— or at least
feign the appearance of one — I’ll
lack, the deﬁning visual feature. And
—- I can guarantee that a beard would
prompt less double—checking and
fewer skeptical stares from behind
the counter at liquor stores — hav-

ing an out—of—state license doesn’t ,

‘ help either.

-

/, ,..,- .~.. .. -,.,..a.,, N‘ ,, -Van‘-gs‘

IfI could grow a beard, I’d be i

sure to experiment with the range
of styles. Hairstyle experimentation
can get a« bit risky. If it looks bad,
you’re stuck with it until your next
haircut.”That is, unless you don’t

' mind getting abuzz ‘cut to ﬁx things.

As for beards, if those handlebars
aren’t ‘working out, shave them off
and in a few days you’llbe back to
the stubbly, rugged look. ’
Beards have historically been

-a trademark characteristic of vi-

rility. In ancient Greece, lacking a
beard was shameful. The ancient
Egyptians had varying outlooks on
wearing beards, but beards were
highly associated with the divine,
and many Egyptian relics feature
gods’ faces adorned, with ornate
beards. Today, pickup trucks, bench
pressing and Denny’s Lumberjack
Slams are all quite manly, yet the
beard remains a natural and time-
less mark of masculinity. _
Maybe you think the beard is

an indicator of scrappiness, lazi— ,

ness and free-spirited rebellion.

Beards should be a standard for gentlemen

Lincoln, Walt Whitman and  Brett
Favre. I’m not sure why the clean-
shaven look is the standard for
today’s affluent businessman. I’ve
heard growing and maintaining a
good-looking beard takes some te-
dious trimming, brushing and even
conditioning. Any gentleman who
devotes that kind of care to his ap-
pearance should be a benchmark

of how to present one’s self profes— ‘

sionally.

But perhaps more importantly,
a 2008 British study found that
women were most attracted to men
who had some stubble on their fac-
es, the Telegraph reported. Of the
various photographs of men that

the women rated, those with full
beards were perceived as the most
masculine, aggressive and socially
mature, even though stubbly men
still won for overall attractiveness.
The clean-shaven men ranked last

shaven look is the standard.

in masculinity. I don’t think the dirt-
stache was ranked, but I’m willing
to bet any guy who wears one is a
real’ lady killer.

Part of the problem has to be
genetics. My dad typically dons the
clean—shaven, businessman look.
Yet even so, he can’t pull off the ﬁill
beard. He’s in his 50s and he still.has
no sign of sideburns —— wonder if
he’s given up by now.

_I’ve literally dreamt about a

ﬁne day when at last I’ve sprouted
a thick, bushy beard, and I can walk
around proudly sporting my trophy
piece.

Then I wake up. I run my hand
over my face to rediscover the fa-
miliar smooth plain.

Alas, part of growing up deals
with facing realizations. Some
dreams just won’t come true.

The 25th Annual Putnam
County Spelling Bee

Pitt Musical Theatre Club *
Frick Fine Arts Auditorium
Free admission

April 16-17

8' p.m.

Some of us avoided middle school
spelling bees at every cost, while
others practiced for weeks only to
crumble in embarrassment upon
misspelling a word like “broccoli.”

But now it’s time to put those bad
memories aside. I

The Pitt Musical Theatre Club’s
upcomingperformance of “The 25th
Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee”

" will make you look back on those

tragic moments and laugh — a lot.

“When we did our ﬁrst read-
through, we were on the ﬂoor dy-
ing of laughter because the show is

just so funny,” sophomore director
Monica Meinert said.

This is the Pit Musical Theatre
Club’s ﬁrst ﬁrll-length play and fea-
tures six driven middle—school spell-
ingbee competitors, each with his or
her own quirky personality.

Their battle against awkward mo-
ments and raging hormones makes
for some PG-13-rated jokes.

No two performances of the play
will be the same.

Before the show, sophomore co-

: director Sharmon Knapp chooses

“guest spellers” from the audience to
participate on stage during the show.

When spellers ask for the deﬁnition
of the word, the principal, played by
Evan.Terwilliger, ad-libs ridiculous
examples of sentence usage.

An orchestra composed of a pi-
ano, synthesizer, drums, ﬂute and
clarinet will accompany the perform-
ers on musical numbers.

The musical has a small cast of
10 with some actors playingmul—
tiple roles. ’

However, Meinert and Knapp
said they felt limited by money and
technology rather than the small
cast. I

Knapp said, adding that the club only
had roughly $400 dollars to make
the play. “The wireless microphones
are from the theater department.
They were really helpful but are
so old that only a few are working.
We’re just going to hope that the ac-
tors get picked up.”

The cost of licensing the show
and renting scripts from Musical
Theater International came from
Student Government Board, al-
lowing the show to be free to the
public. ‘

Additional funds. came from
group ‘fundraisers and donations
from the fall variety show.

Despite budget and technologi-
cal constraints, the two have put
together most of the setting, props
and costumes on their own.‘

Meinert painted the spelling bee
banner above the stage, and both
have gone to Avalon and Goodwill
for costumes. They also credit their
actors for being ﬂexible. .

“We really wouldn’t have gotten

V “It’s really a budget problem,” .

anywhere in the show if all the people ,

in the cast weren’t who they were,”

Meinert said. I
The performers have rehearsed

at least three days per week since

_ February. .

Aswith any student organization,

. the balance between homework and

practice proved difﬁcult but worth
the extra effort.

“I didn’t know most of these peo-
ple before this,” sophomore Natalie
Keil said. “Rehearsal time is ﬁm time
with them, too. It has its rewards
tucked in there.”

Pitt Music Theatre Club member Sarah Tamburelli tries to str

Freshman Sarah Tamburelli,
who has been singing since second
grade, is a theater minor. She plays
Logainne Schwartzandgrubenierre,
the youngest and most politically ac-
tive speller, who speaks with a lisp.

“Her basic conﬂict is striving to

impress her two dads, who are re— f

ally hard on her, and trying to ﬁnd
herself,” she said. '

The performance falls danger-
ously close to ﬁnals week, but Tam-
burelli said she hopes people will

“It’s a good way to inﬂuence peo-

Brendan Schatzki, who plays
an overachieving Boy Scout named

Ifyou adhere to the belief that pop
cultureoperates in2o-yearcycles,then
an artist such as Pittsburgh’s Emily

Rodgers arrived right on schedule.

With her shoegaze-esque guitar I

melodies and ethereal vocals, it’s al-
most diﬂicult to believe Bright Day
isn’t an album that was shelved in
1991 and just released within the last
year. i

Herﬁrst album on Misra Records,
the California label that is home to
indie folk stalwarts such as Shearwa_-
ter and Great Lake Swimmers, Bright
Day manages to hit on nearly every
early ’90s female vocalist touchstone

to such an extent that it’s likely that
Mazzy Star’s “Fade Into You” could
have slipped in somewhere among
the album’s eight tracks and gone un-
noticed.

However; peelingawaythe layers of
dreamy. production values and haunt-
ing vocal effects reveals an obviously
talented musician and songwriter.

Songs such as “Hurricane” and
opener “In Spring Alchemy” are a

testament to her ability to combine -

heart-wrenching, melancholic lyrics

with lush  work.
“I-Iurricanye” contrasts the devasta-

tionleﬁinthewake ofastormtothat .

of afailed relationship, and opener“In
Spring Alchemy” contains a dulcet
guitar line that gives way to Rodgers’
query, “Without words what do we
have?”

For an album that doesn’t even
reach the 40-minute mark, Bright
Day’s most glaring ﬂaw, ironically, is
that it feels too long — particularly
in tracks where Rodgers seems to be

performingas aphotocopy ofNatalie
Merchant rather than simply being
inﬂuenced by her.

This issue wasn’tas_ present on her
previous album, 2oo5’sEmilyRodgers
&HerMajeslys Stars, whichutilizeda
more conventional folk sound. _

While undoubtedly a ﬁne and
admirable album, the challenge that
Bright Dcry presents for Rodgers’
future work is preserving her origi-
nality while remaining true to her
inﬂuences. ’ A

By Lasha Seniuk (MCT Campus)

ARIES (March 21-April 20) Yes-
terday's social differences will this
week be steadily resolved. Silent
disapproval is no longer a continu-
ing theme in emotional or romantic
triangles. Respond quickly to sub
tle suggestions or comments. At
present, creative group proposals
will bring positive results. Laterthis
week daily business routines may
be briefly disrupted. Key officials
will demand completed projects
and revised paperwork. Respond
with confidence: a solid display of
optimism and skill is needed.

TAURUS (April 21-May 20)
Younger friends or relatives may
soon request more of your emo
tional focus. Postponed social
events or unique celebrations will

tion. Allow outdated ideas or past

differences to fade. Loved ones will
follow your example. After Thursday
some Taureans will experience a
brief wave of miscommunications
in the workplace. Financial mis-
takes and lost records may play
a significant role. Tensions will be
high: use humor to bring calm ac-
ceptance.

GEMINI (May 21-June 21) Previ-
ously shy or withdrawn friends will
this week discuss deeply personal
issues. Declarations of love, pri-
vate romantic promises orfamily
disruptions may be highlighted.

Social demands may prove drain- A

ing. Remain quietly cautious but do
encourage others to find balance
with intense emotions. After mid-
week a powerful wave of renewed
business ambition arrives. Much is
changing. Stay open_and study yes-
terday's documents or postponed
projects for valuable clues.

NFL DRAFI' SERIES: PART 3 OF 8

 

Kyle Craig

Staff Writer -

While freshmen Dion Lewis and
Raymond Graham turned heads
with dazzling runs, senior N_ate
Byham did the dirty work of
clearing space for the young
runners. ‘ .

As fellow senior tight end
Dorin Dickerson caughtvtouch—
down passes, Byham ran the in-
termediate routes that stretched
the secondary and freed his team-
mate.

As others made headlines, By-
ham providedthe often—unrecog—
nized effort required of a senior
leader on a bowl—caliber team.
And now, he’s looking for that
work to pay off during the NFL
Draft starting on April 22.

Byham, aFranklin, Pa., native,
arrived at Pitt four years ago as
one of the top tight end recruits
in the nation and as a member of

head coach Dave Wannstedt’s ﬁrst..

highly ranked recruiting class.

With his college career over,
Byham’s ﬁnal statistics of 47re-
ceptions, 612 yards and three
touchdowns might indicate
that he waslunderutilized. But
it-’s his run—blocking ability that
has made him a bona ﬁde NFL
prospect. ,

Pitt tight end coach‘Brian An-
gelichio "thinks that Byham, who
is 6-foot-4 and 268 pounds, is
a top option for any team that
values a tight end who can help
the run game. ‘ V

“Obviously, when you put
the ﬁlm on, that’s one'of his
strengths. There are not many

- end—line blockers across the

country. And Nate has shown the

ability to do that as well as any-.

body in the country,” Angelichio
said. “If you’re [an] NFL team,
you’re obviously looking at him
if you’re looking for an end—line
blocker.” '

As the hybrid tight end -4

someone with the size and-

strength of atraditional tight end
and the skill set of a wide receiver
-—— has become commonplace in
professional football, Byham is a
throwback considering his pro-
pensity to.be ablocker as much

as, if not more than, a receiver.
“There are not too many guys
like me anymore,” Byham said.
“There are not too many guys
like me who are hard—nosed guys,
who are going to get down in the
trenches and block somebody
and try to bloody some noses.
That’s kind of a dying breed of
tight end.” ’
Still, in order to ﬁnd a home
on an NFL team, Byham, a two-

_time All—Big East se1ection,_has

had to prove to scouts this off-
season that his receiving abilities
are up to par.

Last year, .Byham caught.

just 10 passes while Dickerson,
who is another next-level tal-
ent, made 49 receptions for 10
touchdowns.

But Byham isn’t upset about

his lack of receptions. In fact, he’s
glad that Dickersonwas able to
have a breakout year and is now
poised for a professional career
as well. D

I “If anything, I’m happy be- 

cause Dorin was apguy who was
under the radar, and he was able
to raise his stock,”.Byham said.
‘-‘I think’ it was a good thing be-
cause both of us now are very
good prospects.”

Through the NFL Combine, the

Pitt Pro Day and various workouts ’

for professional teams, Byham
has been able to display his re-

ceiving ability for evaluators. He »
- said he passed all of the tests with

flying colors and soft hands.

- “In the long run,'these scouts
know what they’re looking at.
That’s why [they] have the pro

. days. That’s why they have the

combine, and they can see that I
can catch verywell,” he said.

. One area of concern was the
tight end’s timein the 40-yard
dash. While at the NFL Combine,
Byham clocked a 4.97, which
doesn’t particularly standout
from the pack. However, during
his pro day workout, he improved
his time with a 4.91.

With all of that established,

there is still uncertainty as to 4
p where Byham will end up next

year. He has worked out of a few
NFC and AFC teams but is still

uncertain of his destination.

While he waitsfor the draft, he’s

Athletic happenings

“Defensive end named on list

for Lott Trophy, ﬁnalists to be
named in November

Adam Littrnan
Assistant Sports Editor

' Even before the ﬁrst snap of the college foot-
ball season, Pitt defensive end Greg Romeus_

. is attracting attention.
Yesterday, the senior Panther was one of
42 players named to next season’s watch list
for the Lott Trophy, an award given annually
to the best defensive player in college foot-
ball. The award is named for Ronnie Lott, the

former Southern California defensive back

who was inducted into the College Football
Hall of Fame in 2002 and the Pro Football

‘Di-Iall of Fame in 2000 after a 14-year career

primarily with the San Francisco 49ers.

Romeus is entering his senior year at Pitt
after winning Big East Co-Defensive Player of
the Year last year, along with then-teammate-
Mick Williams. Last season, Romeus record-
ed 43 tackles and led the Panthers with eight
sacks and three fumbles recovered.

Five ﬁnalists for the award will be named
in late November, and the winner will be an-
nounced in mid—December, after the regular
season schedule ends.

Women ’s basketball assistant
coach takes job at Clemson
after Zgyears coaching Pitt

Adam Littman
_ Assistant Sports Editor

Pitt women’s basketball assistant coach Yo-
lett McPhee—McCuin has left the Panthers
for an assistant coaching job at Clemson,
the Pitt athletic department confirmed

yesterday.

McPhee—McCuin joined Pitt’s staff be-
fore the 2008 season, coming from Port-
land, Ore., where she was the recruiting
coordinator. With the Panthers‘, McPhee-
McCuin worked partly as a recruiter and
also scouted opponents. -

But McPhee—McCuin isn’t the only loss
for the Panthers so far this offseason.

Also leaving are former Pitt players
Shawnice “Pepper” Wilson, Sarah Ogoke
and Kate Popovec. Wilson is heading to
Miami, Fla. - . ~ '

In March, Panthers associate coachjeff
Williams also left the program to take the
head coaching job at La Salle.

Byham ranked high among

competing tight ends  

Byham 4 11

[I said] I>haven’t seen some of the [draft
projections]. None of it really holds true.
Every year there are guys who they say are
going in the ﬁrst—second round that go in
the fourth-ﬁfth,” Byham said. “There’s no
reason to get caught up in it because no
one really has any clue.”

Scout.com has Byham listed as a three-
star prospect and the 13th best tight end
available. Rivals.com ranks him as the
ninth best at his position and the writ-
ers on NFL.com place him 15th among his
competition. 1

An assortment of mock drafts place
Byham as a mid-round selection. But, as
Byham put it, a lot of those estimations
are done by amateurs, and he’s far more
concerned about what the professionals
think about him. .

“I take to heart what the coaches that

_ I talk to from the NFL say to me and what

my coaches tell me and what my agent tells

‘me,” he said.

Angelichio praised Byham for what he
can bring to a team, beyond his measurable
physical traits.

“He brings a toughness and a passion

for the game of football. Coachable, hard-
working, extremely driven, and‘he’s a guy
that you’re not going to worry about doing
the right thing,” Angelichio said.
The former Franklin Knight will leave
Pitt with a degree in communication and a
, perspective of how far the football program
has come over the past four years.
“I came in with blind faith, knowing that

we could get this program turned around,”

he said.
While Byham said that the he will always
regret not winning a Big East title, he is

happy that the Panthers went 9-4 and 10-3 4

in his last two seasons.

Byham noted that he doesn’t have a
preference about which team he ends up
on. However, he said that teams which con-
centrate on running the ball would provide
a good ﬁt for him. Even in the event that
he isn’t drafted, the amount of attention
Byham is receiving from NFL franchises
indicates that he will be in a team’s training
-camp this summer.

.“I think once I get on a team, I’ll be able
to prove to them that I can play football,
and I’ll stay around,” Byham said.

Kelly Flanigan

Bearcats by 21 points at halﬁime.

Then Cincinnati quarterbackTonyPikeledthe .

“We are working every day to ﬁnd an edge

The Panthers ﬁnished 9-3 last season under
Wannstedt, their best ﬁnish since 1981. He re-
cently accepted atwo-year extension on his con-
tract, keeping him at Pitt until the 2014 season.

“They know that I’m here and I’m not go-
ing anywhere. I’ve said that from day one, and
I haven’t wavered from that. My motive has not

changed since ﬁrst coming to the University of "
_ Pittsburgh. It may seem too simple, but it truly

is to graduate every football player that comes
to this University,” Wannstedt said.
The Panthers begin their bounce back after

. lastyeaﬁs disappointment at Saturday's Blue-Gold

Game, an intra-squad scrimmage that signals the
end of springpractice. The event features three
mainsections: a coaches “ChalkTall€’ and akids
clinic, both lastingfrom 12:30 to 1:30 p.m., and
‘then the actual scrimmage itself, which is set to
begin at2 p.m. at Heinz Field. Admission is ﬁee,
and the gates opentothepublic at noon. Itwillbe
broadcast liveto local and nationalTVaudiences
on Pittsburglfs CW and the NFL Network.

So what should fans expect and watch for in

_ Saturday’s scrimmage?

First and foremost, the quarterbackbattlewilli

. beevident.Alterlosingveterar_1quarterbackBill‘

Stnll to graduation, contenders Pat Bostick and
Tino Sunseri will battle for the startingslot.

“I think both of those guys are more than
qualiﬁed to lead this football team. Pat has the
experience and knowledge. Tino probably has a
little more armstrength and athleticability. Ifeel
good aboutboth ofthem,bothareworkinghard

" and getu'ngbetter,”Wannstedt said.

Anumber of other question marks stilllinger

' fromlastseason’s losses. Howwill the Panthers

make up forthe offensive production oftight ends

' NateByhamandDorinDickerson?Thedefensive

prowess of Mick Williams and Gus Mustakas?

Losses suchastheseareenoughtoputserious
dou_bt into the minds of fans everywhere, but Pitt:
has morethanenough talent on the 2010 roster
to compensate. -

Jonathan Baldwin and Mike Shanahan com-
bine for two reliable targets no matterwho wins
the quarterbackbattie.Asadeeptl1reat, Baldwin
scored eight touchdowns on:57.,receptions in.

2009. Pittexpectsbigthings from Shanahanthis
season, as he averaged 14.1 yards per catch as a
freshman last season.

With the retum ofDionLewis and backup Ray
Graham in the backfield, the Panthers are well

. covered at the running back position. Lewis ran

for 1,799 yards and 17 touchdowns, and Graham
added another 349 ‘yards and four touchdowns
in2009. .

On defense, Jabaal Sheard and Greg Romeus
look to make an impact. Romeus, an undeniable

' leader of the Panthers and also the Conference 0

Co-Defensive Player of the Year, passed on the
NFLto return.to Pitt forhis senior season.
Atdefensive lineman, Shayne Hale and Bran-
don Lindsey, both Pittsburgh locals, will look to
anchorthe line. Hale, who tookaredshirt lastyear,
moved from the middle linebacker position to

_ back up Romeus at defensive end. He is expected

to see as many as 20 snaps per game.
Linebacker Dan Masonwill replace the gradu-
ated Adam Gunn. Last season, as a freshman,-

ﬂu‘

Mason had 26 tackles and an interception.
“Having seen AdamGunn, I watched his pa-
tience. Beingalinebacker, you’ve gotto beaggnes-
sive but also patient, wait forthingsto develop and
then get to where you need to be,” said Mason.
' Certainlythefans areanxioustoseethe prog;
ress the team has made after spring practice.
“This isthe onlytime whenyou’re notworried
about a game and you can really make funda-
mentals‘-— blocking and tackling — a point of
emphasis,” Wannstedt said. ‘
