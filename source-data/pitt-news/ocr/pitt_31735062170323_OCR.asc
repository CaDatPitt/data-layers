Nifty-gritty Re-election
Campaign Anticipated

\ by JOHN CAPITMAN
Chuck Steeber, regional coordinator for the College Republicans in

Southwestern Pennsylvania, feels that “the President has done ev-
erything during his first term to earn himself another term. "

Steeber, a junior at Pitt, is also the chairman and founder ofthe
Washington County Young Republican Voters which is trying to or-
. ganize the potential voters between 18 and 24 in that county.

‘As a result of these two positions he has recently been named
Youth Coordinator for the Washington County branch of the Committee

to Reelect the President.

During the Summer Steeber, Lynn Alstadt. a senior majoring in
Political Science, and others have been organizing the college vote in
the Pittsburgh region. At the present time every college "in this area
has an organization of College Republicans that is working for Mr. Nix-

on’s reelection.

The ‘College Republicans at Pitt (who have their office at 301

Schenley Hall), according to Alstadt, will concentrate almost entirely
on the presidential campaign “simply because most student interest
and knowledge will be on that level.” But they will not neglect other
races like that of Glenn Williams “who is the first black man to run for
a state-wide non-judicial position”—treasurer.

When Steeber was asked about youth as a special group he explain-
ed that they are special because they are voting for the first time; yet
he maintains “that the opinions of young people do not vary too much

from those of their parents.

“We are working basically on organization at this point and voter
registration, with the real nitty-gritty campaign coming in October
when we will canvas the dorms and get mailings out to commuters,"

Steeber said.

Steeber went on to explain the importance of the youthvote to the
Republicans. “We are,” he said. "unlike the Democrats. because we
are not part of coalition of special interest groups. Youth, though, does
have some special interest, like the war, but the people who support

Qthe President, support his foreign policy, likethe trips to Moscow and
P Peking.”

Many ’of,the people that Steeber worked with in Washington Coun-
ty were, as he pointed out, “afraid of McGovern because he wants to
get away from what America should be.” But he hastened to add, “We
are not running a campaign against George McGovern.”

“Nixon is not loved by the American,” added Alstadt, "he does not
have charisma like a John Kennedy. But we feel that his record sur-
passes that of McGovern so much that there really is not grounds for

comparing the two.”

Student Problems to Become Issue

Housing Duties Change

by LYNN E. KRAFT

Vice Chancellor of Operations
Joseph Dutton has announced
changes in the personnel of his
department. According to Mr.
Dutton‘ these’ changes will allow
his office to more easily “address
itself to thejcores of problems
within the ‘University instead of
fighting numerous small fires.”

One of the most‘ important
changes for students is in Univer-
sity Housing. John Vrana has
been relieved of some of his du-
ties with Resident Assistants tak-
ing over Mr. Vrana’s job of hand-
ling individual student problems.

Mr. Vrana will be studying the
possibility of, Pitt beginning its

(own food service or finding a bet-

ter food service contract.

He will also be looking into the
need of housing another 1,200 stu-
dents. This new housing will be
similar to the suites in Bracken-
ridge Hall, with four to. five stu-
dents sharing each unit. The
apartment-like complex will have
provisions for students to prepare
their own meals. The University
will exert little or no control over
these units.

Another change of importance

has occurred in the Registrar‘s'

office. Dr. Richard Allshouse has

accepted a position in the College,
of Education and will be replaced ‘
; by Frank Reed. formerly assis-1
5 «tant-:Comptroller. Mr. Reed hopes; ,

 
 

to make the University more re-
sponsive to student questions and
problems with registration.

City Police to Handle Some Cases

Book Store Revises Theft Policy

by_ RICK-EULER

A new theft policy approved this 
past spring will permit the Uni- 
versity Book Store to bring in the ;

Pittsburgh police if an apprehend-

. ed person should prove uncooper-

ative. -

Mary Bonach. director of the
Book Store. explained that if a
suspect refuses to present an ID
or to sign a confession. the mat-

ter will be put in the hands of the .

Pittsburgh police.

“In the past, students who were

caught stealing books were clear-
ed through the Dean of Student’s
Office,” Bonach explained. ‘.‘But
Dean Moye proposed that a new
method be used last winter.’V’

Moye said that he felt the old
system was not an effective one.
"A student who was caught steal-
ing would come to the Dean's of-
fice have his wrists slapped and
that would be “that,” said Moye.
“Of course, if a student showed a
false ID and decided not to come
to the office, nothing could be
donef’

Moye added that the students
caught stealing were not usually
needy. “We found that students
were stealing books purely for
profit and not because they could-
n't afford them,” he said. "After
they stole them, they would sell
the books to others at a cut price.”

anyone stealing books would ask
them to sign a confession before
calling in the police.

“It’s a standard form,” he add-
ed, “listing the quantity of ma-
terial taken, acknowledging the
time and date, and containing an
admission by the student that they
took a book.”

Bowen emphasized that stu-
dents would be informed of their
rights before being presented with
the confession.

Activities Fee Impugned

by JOAN EASTBOURN

The first official Student Gov-
ernment Board meeting of the
new term was highlighted by the
attendance of Dr. "Alfred Moye.
Dean of Student Affairs. Dr. Moye
was present to welcome back
members and to bring them up to
date on the events of the summer.

The Dean’s discussion center-
ed on the proposed referendum on
the University’s activity fee. He
expressed the concern of
Board of Trustees and said they
are in favor of the referendum.
"The student activity fee is a main
issue «on campuses all over the
country and in school after school
it is coming up to a referendum
vote by the student body,” he said.

The entire question focuses on
the use of the fee, what Moye calls
an “issue of legitimacy.” He feels
students at large are unaware to-
ward just what purpose the fee is
used. Advising Student Govern-
ment, he deemed it necessary to
“blow your own horn and let stu-
dents know where support for
campus activities and events
comes from.” It is more appar-
ent that, presented in a positive

light, the fee would stand a better,

chance and be approved it brought
to referendum, than being viewed
as a $12 “tax” on the invoice.

Dr. Moye opposes the idea of
stuffing invoices with the referen-

dum ballot because in this man-,
her people with no interest would

be voting whereas in a poll refer-t
. only; the concerned -stu-
U. ' /_ »‘ .' . / , ‘ , ‘a

 
  

 

the .

       

dents who make the effort tovgo
out and vote would be counted.
With this latter approach, the fee
would more probably be passed.

In addition to the referendum
issue, Moye also reported sum-
mer progress in other areas. He
noted the evident work done in
dormitories and the initiation of
the Residence" Life Office to bet-
ter satisfy residents housing
needs. Outlining the new exten-
sive Resident Assistant training
program, he cited the goal as an

" attempt to “restore good atti-

tudes” to community life in cam-
pus housing.

He announced the promotion of
Dr. Joann Robinson to be the new
director of the Student Health
Service, terming her “very cap-
able.”

The new Blue Cross health in-
surance plan adopted by the Uni-
versity was discussed, with Board
members by Dr. Moye and Bill
Markus, new Associate Dean of
Student Affairs. Common approv-
al of the program was voiced with
Board President Tom Bailey sum-
ming it up saying “for onlyj$12

more, the benefits far outweight

the increase.”

Dr. Moye announced the forma-
tion of an Office of Veterans’ Af-
fairs "to respond to the problems
of vets returning to school.” He
cited statistics demonstrating
that Pennsylvania is third in num-
ber of. veterans ‘returning and a

bad scene around the‘ country"
and that the solution was not a:

Developement of New Groups Slated

Counseling Center Due to Expcm

by S/HARON SEXTON
"Campus Editor

Due to an increasing demand by
members of the University com-
munity, the Counseling Center is
presently offering an expanded
Developmental Group program.

Dr. Warreki T. Hill, the leader
of the Developmental Groups ex-
plains that “despite popular opin-
ion these groups are not psychic
roller coaster rides. We strive to
create a community of trust in
which ‘each person feels encour-
aged to express himself.” Ex-
plaining that human motivation is
often difficult to pinpoint, Hill
says that people join his groups
for any number of reasons.

“A self-actualizingperison may

’ . see it as an opportunity to make

new friends, to try out new ideas.”
Onthe other hand people join the
group to see how others cope with
the problems which are bothering

them. “People often benefit vi-
cariorsly through another per-
son's verbalization of their prob-
lems.”

Hill explained that his typical
group member is someone who is
dissatisfied with the relationships
he shares with others and is striv-
ing to make his life fuller through
enriched inter—personal relation-
ships. In the atmosphere of mini-
mal threat which we try to create
one learns to take risks with peo-
ple,-/and to discuss one‘s ideas and
feelings openly and honestly."

Interviews with several of last
years group members indicate
that the groups were very suc-
cessful; in fact many of the mem-
bers were very sorry to see the
sessions end. «

Often their statements about the
groups echo Dr. Hill. Their pri-
mary motivation in entering the
group was a desire to meet new

ous as to what actually went on in
“encounter” groups and joined
out of curiosity.

In addition to meeting new peo-
ple. they remarked at the ease
with which they were able to in-
teract closely with strangers.
Many also found solace in the fact
that the problems which they
faced were shared by the others.

tered around the discussion of

Developmental groups are com-

The Center is presently form-

engaged, or seriously dating) and
members of the faculty. The
groups will meet at various times
both during the day and at night.

Health ‘Insurance Policy 

by LOIS ELDER

The Legal Awareness Commit-
tee has received complaints con-
cerning the student health insur-
ance waiver card that was sent to
students with their invoices last
month.

According to Bob Ging. a spokes-
man for Legal Awareness, "The
complaints came from dorm resi-
dents who. because of the waiver
card. were ledto believe signing
up for the Blue Cross/Blue Shield
program was mandatory for them.

“It isn’t necessary for them to
buy the policy if they already have
some other type of health insur-
ance, but the waiver statement
doesn’t tell them this.”

Gary Houston, executive assis-
tant to the Dean of Student Af-
fairs. Dr. Alfred Moye. said a
meeting was called Friday to
study the complaints resulting
from the waiver card.

According to Houston. “The re-
sult of that meeting is a letter that
will be sent to all dorm students
from Dr. Moye."

The letter explains how they

“Before students go for a re-

for an internist and $13 for a gyne-

of health insurance. This protects
not only the University but other

enough. It could be interpreted

Houston, "The enrollment of non-

by VIRGINIA COOK

While half a million spaces in
entering freshman classes report-
edly go begging in colleges and
universities around the country,
Pitt’s freshman roster, particu-
larly in the College of Arts and
Sciences, is pleasingly “plump,”

‘ according to Kenneth J. Wenger.

Dean of Admissions.

"Pitt’s lucky,” Wenger said.
referring to the state-related pos-
ition of the University which al-
lows it to offer quality education
at a cost significantly lower than
private universities. Wenger esti-
mated that only 90 per cent of the
spaces in private colleges were
filled as classes opened this year,
and further stated that their ad-
missions offices were probably
considering any applications they
received right up until classes
started. Pitt had been contacted
by 'several schools, Mr. Wenger

said, asking for names of stu-
dents Pitt had turned away. Since
this is unethical, Pitt refused to
release the names, but it points up
the “big crunch” in education to-
day, Wenger said.

Wenger noted that high school
students, are often unaware of
class size, majors and programs
offered, and outstanding depart-
ments and faculty at the universi-
ty they are considering attending,
often basing their final decision
on enrollment solely on financial
considerations. ‘

Citing the fact that Pitts out-
of-state enrollment over‘ the past
two years has remained stable at
about six or seven per cent, and
emphasizing education’s rising
costs, Mr. Wenger said, “You’re
talking about $3,700-$3,900 a
year for an out-of-state student to
come to Pitt.”. '

Rush Hours

In discussing the controversary
that has long existed over how
many out-of-state students Pitt
could admit and still fulfill its re-
sponsibilities as a state-related
institution, Mr._Wenger said, “I
don’t think we should take out-of-
state students who are less quali-
fied than Pennsylvania students.

Pitt’s abundant enrollment is
also partially due, Mr. Wenger
said, to the four branch campuses.
Those students who cannot be ac-
commodated on the Oakland cam-
pus can go to Bradford, Greens-
burg, Titusville, or Johnstown,
which now has a full four-year
program.

Many students prefer the branch
campuses, with their smaller
classes and individualized atten-
tion, to ease the transition from
high school to college. Others,
however, who applied to Pitt be-

One Way Traffic Becomes Poffern

by KAREN BURGIO

The Forbes-Fifth Avenues one way traffic pat-
tern will be permanently adopted, according to
Pittsburgh Police Desk Sergeant Richard Pelusi.

"The traffic pattern, which was inaugerated
June 18 for a 60 day trial period, has worked well
and will be kept in effect,” he said.

The traffic on Fifth Ave. is one way west from
N. Dithridge to Fifth and «Sixth Streets downtown
while traffic on Forbes is one way east from Stan-
wix Street to N. Dithridge.

Sergeant Pelusi also commented on the need
for more motorcycle police to patrol traffic, es-
pecially during rush hours.

"Some people stop in the middle of traffic to
load or unload; even in three minutes time this can

result in a big traffic jam. We’re trying to have
more motorcycle patrolling, but at the time these
patrolmen are stationed on street corners.

Meanwhile, the resurfacing of Fifth Ave. has
progressed to Atwood and McKee. Reclaimed as-
phalt is being used for the project and Pelusi noted
that it is working quite well.

The only problem with the repaving job on Fifth
is that workmen block more lanes of traffic with
their equipment than they need to.

“We in the Department of Public Safety have
continually asked these workmen to keep all lanes
of traffic open except the one they are working on.
Until a few days ago, this was not the case.”

Pelusi could not give an expected completion
date, only that the work will be completed as soon
as possible. ,

cause of its urban setting, are dis-
appointed if they must spend two
years in a rural setting.

Along with the overall lower at-
trition rate in the student body,
Wenger cited the growth of the
regional campuses as one of the
reasons Pitt has been unable to
accept more transfer students. As
the branches grew, the number of
juniors they sent to the~Oakland
campus increased, and the fewer
transfer students Pitt was able to
accept. Last year, of 400 qualified
students who applied to transfer
to Pitt, only 200 could be accept-
ed. The School of Education was
unable to admit any transfer stu-
dents in elementary education,
Wenger said.

While the entering freshman
class in CAS is 100 stronger than

last year, the School of Engineer- .

ing’s enrollment decreased about
10 per cent, Wenger said. Al-

though the School of Engineering '
showed the best return of offers ‘. -.
of admissions, withI53 per cent  '

of its offers being accepted (43
per cent is considered normal),
Engineering’s freshman enroll-
ment is 263, down from 293 last
year.

In the School of Nursing, the sit-

uation was just the opposite:_

Nursing had a 40 per cent in-
crease in applications, Wenger
said. He explained the increase by
saying that more and more stu-
dents are looking ahead to deter-
mine the prospects of employ-
ment after graduation, and the

medical professions are currently  

looking for qualified people. Also,
the Pennsylvania State Universi-
ty at McKeesport discontinued
Wenger said many students who
would normally have applied

_ out of place.

The process is repeated; lane
by“ lane, until safety is reached;
The danger here ‘is obvious. A
single motorist straddling lanes,
as so many in Pittsburgh feel com-
pelled to do, can end a promising
career in an instant.

A somewhat bolder tactic is to
approach the Avenue at a dead
run. shifting direction at ever_y
stride and glaring directly at
each automobile in its turn. Most
of them can be intimidated. This
approach is flashy. perhaps too
much so for the purist. but is
easily the most exciting. The
sound of screeching brakes. angry
horns. and the occasional cr_ump—
ling fender accompanies the hero
as he pedests in triumph. He must
be clever as well as quick. but
the rewards are great.

This is also the fastest way to
cross.

My roommate. who was raised
in Hamburg. takes an entirely
different tact. She uses a Euro-
pean technique which is just as
effective here as on the Con-
tinent. I myself have used it in
Paris. New York. and even here
in Pittsburgh. and it works.

The key to what I‘ll call the
Hamburg Stroll is an absolutely
straightforward approach. The
pedestrian gazes neither to the
left nor to the right on an ordinary

two-way street. On a one—way street

he looks only to the right or to
the left. as appropriate. always
away from the approaching traf-
fic. '

There is an assumption here that
the average driver, while willing
to compete with, and sometimes
frighten, pedestrians, would really
rather not kill them. He has a sense
of fairness.

The next time you pedest. ob-
serve carefully. You will see that
drivers do not drive directly at
you until you have glanced in
their direction. In effect. then.
you have been warned; you know
the danger you face. and «cars
will no longer shrink from kill-
ing you.

However. the driver who will
willingly strike a pedestrian who
is unaware of his presence is
rare. If this were not so our
streets would be clotted with the
carcasses of the absent—minded.
the slow. and the blind. And they
aregnot; at least not to the point
of impeding traffic.

So here is the procedure. The
pedestrian approaches the curb
at a normal walking pace, and,
without breaking stride, steps
into the street. Gazing straight
ahead or slightly to one side (al-
ways away from coming traffic)
he crosses. His nonchalance must
be perfect. It sometimes helps
to whistle.

SG Involvement Benefits

PlRG’s

by LOIS LEVINSON

The Pitt Student Government
has become an ardent friend to
the Pitt Public Interest Research
Group(PIRG). Initially reluctant
to accept the group on its own
terms. a series of compromises

over the summer‘ has led to pro— ‘

ductiyc cooperation.

PIRG. an organization that pro-
poses to attack problems concern-
ing consumer protection. environ-
mental responsibility. and discrim-
ination. suffered a set—back when
the Administration and Board of
Trustees turned down their origin-
al proposal for an invoice fundf
ing mechanism.

Sudent Government issued a
statement in agreement with the
Board’s decision, but after fur-
ther discussion with PIRG mem-
bers, discovered that the Admin-
istration had not handled the
situation fairly and openly.

S. G. President Tom Bailey
wrote a formal request to Judge
Aldisert asking for detailed rea-
sons for their refusal.

Since then, S.G. has given con-
siderable effort insuring fair
treatment for PIRG. acting as a
go-between for PIRG and Admin-
istration representatives.

Recently, the Allocations Com-
mittee passed PIRG’s budget,
thereby giving them the initial
monies for setting up an office
and leaving the group free to turn
attention to special courses and
projects it has initiated.

This working relationship be-
tween the two groups can only
add to their individual effective-
ness.

Though it would be unrealistic
for S. G. to shoulder the burden
of PIRG's administrative respon-
sibilities. by cooperating they can
form a strong base of power for
constructive student action. And
that’s the raison d’etre for a stu-
dent government and a public

fr -l°"l¢e .3U¢' were three or four functioning

,“PIRGs in this country.

~

P I ate
Operating PIRGS now exist in
Connecticut. New York. Iowa.
Massachusetts, Missouri. Min-
nesota, N. Carolina. Texas. Mich-
igan. Oregon, Ohio. Vermont. Ari-
zona. Wisconsin, and Hawaii. There
are. in all. 26 PIRGS already
operating or in preparation to do
so, including one in London.
England. '

All of these groups are student
funded and directed. Many were
able to use the original plan of
billing students $2.00 per term on
their tuition invoices. (money
refundable upon request.) in order
to pay a staff or paid'profession—
als. ’

Many others,
formed

however, have
strong coalitions with

their student governments. Al-

ready they have found solutions
to some of the problems men-
tioned above and are implement-
ing them in their cities and com-
munities.

There is hope that this will
be our course of action and that
this is where our strength will
lie.

POLICY

ALL letters to the Pitt News
must be typewritten and carry
the full name of the writer
with the school and address. A
name will be withheld upon
request if the writer gives rea-
sons for not wanting his name
to appear, but the editors must
know who the writer is. letters
signed from recognized cam.
pus or community organizq.
tions will be published.

 

Some cars will stop. Others will
swerve madly around him. pre-
ferring to threaten others who
have seen them. A few will modi-
fy their speeds so as to pass with-
out harming him. But he will
reach the other side. serene and
perhaps a bit smugly pleased with
himself.

One caution. Buses. police
cars. and taxis are immune to the
Hamburg Stroll. They will hit
you. A casual survey a few yards
before entering the street is ad-
visable. I

Here at Pitt the Stroll is par-
ticularly recommended. Those who

attempt to pedest by broken-.

field running. or by utilizing the
exquisite timing of the bull rings,
may find themselves distracted
into mortal danger.

At every side there are persons
of an enormous variety of colors.
sizes and genders. Many are en-
tertainingly clothed. some are cos-
imagination. The attention wan-
ders. and disaster waits.

(My roommate says it is rude
and possibly chauvinistic to refer
to the pedestrian as “he." Iam

enclosing several s’s and r's to

change ':he” to “she" and “his"
to “her." sss rrr.)

Good luck. see you later. Across

New Director Appointed

Student Affairs to Administer ICH

by MIKE MILLER

The Intercultural House. an
inter-racial living experiment at
the University has come under
the administration of the Student
Affairs area for the first time this
year.

The project was founded by Dr.
John Tyler of the Political Sci-
ence department and went into
operation in January of 1970.
The project, which has 10 black
and 10 white students living to-

MOON: Brings Gestalt
Philosophy to IC House

gether in a fraternity house en-
vironment, was originally fund-
ed by the Gertrude Stein Foun-
dation, of which Tylor and his
wife are trustees.

Last winter'Tyler attempted
to negotiate with the Univer-
sity to take over funding of the
project because the Gertrude

 

Stein Foundation was
short of funds.

Originally the House provided
f'ree room and board for the mem-
bers with the University giving
tuition scholarships.

running

Tyler attempted to get a great-
er financial commitment from
the University while retaining
administrative control of the
House.

Dr. Alfred Moye, Dean of Stu-
dent Affairs whose office acted
as a liason between the Univer-
sity and the House said that
the University was unable to
assume total financial responsi-
bility for the House. He also
said that the University would
demand some administrative con-
trol if they were to take over some
of the funding. '

The Stein foundation now gives
house members a room scholar-
ship, requiring them to pay for
board. The University has tuition
scholarships available’ based on
financial need.

Samuel Moon, a member of Dr.
Moye’s staff and a graduate
student in Counselor Education
is now acting as Head Resident
of the House. Moon worked as
the chairman and co-founder of
the Minority Community Work-

 shop as Illinois Wesleyan Uni-

versity. The workshop provided
educational and career counsel-
ing for high school blacks and
is now functioning on a national
basis under the auspices of the
United Fund.

In addition to a more structur-
ed operation involving payment
of breakage fees, ’ key deposits
and strict inventories of house
equipment, Moon hopes to improve
the focus of the project.

“In the past there have been
problems simply because of the
personalities of the guys in the
house,” Moon said. He cited
“external forces” acting on indi-
vidual members, resulting in “con-
flict and disruption.”

He hopes to bring the philo-
sophy of his Minority Community
Workshop to the House.

“All men are reasonable and
susceptable to change," he said.
“I want the House to embody this
changef’

“Change is constant in our cul-
ture whether we participate in that
change or not.

“The question is whether we
believe we can and should help
plan that change or let change‘
happen haphazardly. If we do

not enter into the process of plan-

ning for that change, are" we pre-
pared to allow others to plan for‘
us ?”

“This is the question we’re con-
sidering in planning our goals,"
Moon said. He also said that the
House would function under a
Gestalt psychology. “The whole
is more important than the parts
but the parts must be defined
and clarified.”

Moon replaces William Tiga
Tita, a graduate student in busi-
ness, who left the House to fin-
ish his doctoral thesis.

‘Ten  Wheel Drive's'

They’ve spent about a month
and a half working on new materi-
al and another month should find
them in the record plant putting
out another smash for Polydor.

I stopped in the Big Apple for a
day last week on my way to the
four season state of Vermont.
While there I stayed with a long
time friend and cohort. one Steph-
an Gelfand (better known to his
friends as Fontz), who just hap-
pens to be the bass player for the
"new” Ten Wheel Drive.

Fontz and I used to play togeth-
er in a road band out of Pittsburgh
called Saving Grace and shared a

with curious cow in upstate New
York. He later joined another top
notch local band named Friar
Tuck and strengthened the Pitts-
burgh musical scene for several
more months before striking off
to find success in New York.

After a stint with the now dead
and buried Alive and Kicking, he
served an apprenticeship by do-
ing session work on albums with
the likes of Tim Moore and Ike and
Tina Turner. He supplemented his
sporadic income by doing a little
modeling on the side.

Yes girls, he can be seen on the
back of the September National
Lampoon snuggled in with a bevy
of other boy beauties. He’s the one
on the right wearing the light
green sunglasses and holding the
Telecaster and his socks up.

Despite my eight hour driving
fatigue. I couldn’t turn down his
invitation to sit in on a rehearsal
of the “new” Ten Wheel Drive.

The cab driver from E. 25th to
E. 18th gave me time to reflect
upon my first encounter with the
Ten Wheel sound. I had a copy of
their first album laid on me about
four years ago and was impress-

ed then with the brash, funky feel

of their music.

They had a female vocalist at
that time named Genya Ravan
with a style that burned like dry
ice. She stayed with them through
two albums and a Single (“Mom-
ing Much Better”) before at-
temping to put on the cloak of sin-
gular stardom. After one solo al-
bum the cloak seems to have slip-
ped.

We unloaded and entered a no:
name building which must have
been a garment warehouse at one

 

time but presently houses the
Puerto Rican Traveling Theatre.
An elevator ride took us to the
second floor. home of Zounds Re-
hearsal Studio—-$10 an hour — not
responsible for equipment left
overnight.

The ceiling was covered with
giant, stuffed, multi-colored
snakes and a painted backdrop of
an old New York gas-lit street
corner hung over one wall. I
plunked myself down with sever-
al other bodies on an orange mat-
tress turned observation deck.

As the various “Wheels” filled
the room. the conversations flut-
tered from houses in Haiti to how
much better Doris Day looks in
the September of her years.

For the most part a serious
tone prevailed, brought on by the

fact that today the representa—’

tives from the William Morris
Agency (who have booked Ten
Wheel Drive all along) would be
dropping by to hear and evaluate
the reorganized band. Everyone
knows that if these boys don’t dig

the sound, it ain’t going nowhere.

Aram Schefrin plays guitar and
has donea script for a play which
might possibly go on Broadway.
Mike Zager plays organ and has
written and scored his own sym-
phony. They originated Ten Wheel
Drive and together they share the
writing, arranging and leadership
of the group. -

Aram’s calm, strong assured-
ness coupled with the Zager per-
sonality and driving control make
them a perfect combination.

Annie Sutton hails from Pitts-
burgh and if she sang good when
she was here (and she did ’cause
I heard her) she is fantastic with
this band. Before landing this gig,
Annie‘ did two albums with the
now defunct Rascals. Since then
she has been singing a lot of jin-
gles and is currently also doing
backup vocals with two other
women in a group called Ethylene.

Some‘ people might call this
hometown prejudice but up until
now there’s been no one capable
of filling the vacant Joplin throne.

by ARTHUR ROSENBERG
Drama Critic
One of the most outstanding

if characteristics of the Pittsburgh

P1ayho_use‘s current production
of Fiddler on the Roof is its au-
thenticity. It is most often the
case that once a show leaves the
Broadway stage, subsequent pro-
ductions become less and less ar-
tistically satisfying . . . especially
when done by regional theatres.

In this case. there is an excep-

milkman, his trials and tribula-
tions as he struggles to support
and raise his family of five daugh-
ters in the tiny Russian village of
Anetevka during the period of the
Jewish purge by the Czar’s re-
gime. It is filled with humor or
tragedy, as well as a cast of de-
lightful characters.

Fiddler on the Roof is impres-
sive because of its director. Stev-
en Bohm brings unity and preci-

good. A horn section that blew like

Donald Hower, former assistant band director at Ohio State Uni-

He replaces Edmund Williams. who resigned during the summer
after many bandsmen and alumni refused to support him and question-

ed his ability to lead the band.

Football fans will be greeted by a band smaller-in numbers but
proficient in the traditional marching style of the Pitt Band.

by Jean Langlais. one of the great-
est organ virtuosi of our time. at
Heinz Chapel gives us another
prestigious event to add to that
list of recitals.

Mr. Langlais. the titular organ-
ist of Sainte Clothilde in Paris. ap-
peared before a capacity audience
in a recital sponsored by our
city's universities and the Pitts-
burgh chapter of the American

Guild of Organists. Very rarely"

has the presence of genius been so
immediately felt as it was in this
program. The French musician
presented a program of composi-
tions which reflected the variety
of his national school.

1One finds it difficult to recall
any other occasion when our chap-
el’s instrument has sounded forth

so magnificently. While I person-

ally found portions of the program
less than exciting far too many
“Dialogues” at the beginning of
the program brought the “dia-
logue” between the artist and the
audience to a rather precarious
point, there were enough key-
board and pedalboard fireworks
to please the novice listeners as
well as those more “unusual”
works which especially appeal to
the more discriminating listener.

We must have imagined clouds
of incense rising to the vaults as
the dialogues for various portions
of the mass sequence dissipated
into the air. Langlais. however.
gave us little time to meditate on
this delicate fare. In utter con-
trast. the “king of instruments"
soon blarred forth a most tri-
umphant “trompette" via the
Piece Heroique of Cesar Franck.

But the experience of the m_vs—
tic was'once again in our ears as
the first part of the program con-
cluded with the ever esoteric ef-
forts of composer Charles Tour-
nemire.

As a composer, Langlais’ work
has already gained a very strong
foothold in the repetoire. He is a
composer who, as the second part
of the program clearly displayed,
has taken an interest in many fac-
ets of the world’s life: the ecu-
menical movement (Gloire a
Dieu), the continual presence of

hypocrisy in our_ existence (Im- '

ploration No. 3), and even the
power of folklore (Canticle).

At the conclusion of the pro-
gram, the art of improvisation

was manifested in all its glory as
the artist created his own com-
position "'on the spot“ with two
themes (one of which was our

JEAN LANGLAIS

Alma Mater) submitted to him
immediately before the program.
While many French organists
have tended to exaggerate the im-

   

provisational technique in recent
years with an almost symphonic
structure, Langlais’ approach is
quite different and perhaps more
easily grasped. -

Even though the theme may be
treated harmonically. fugally.
etc.; the structure of the work re-
mains fairly succinct and does
not lose its sense of proportion;
and what pleasure a well propor-
tioncd improvisation can bring to
the listener. ’

It was this very sense of beauty
in his improvisation and his inter-
pretations that earned Mr. Lang-
lais the stunning ovation which he
received at the conclusion of the
program. And with that ovation of
gratitude in mind, wealso think’
it necessary to express our
thanks; Merci beacous, Monsieur
Langlais, merci beacous.

Saturday afternoon's 19-7 loss
by the Pitt panthers to the Florida
State Seminoles was not ‘offen-
sive' to the eyes of the Pitt fans
and in that lay all of the Panthers
problems. g V

The Wishbone offense that
the gridders have been utilizing
during practice somehow did not
materialize in actual play against
FSU. -

The Panthers lacked the speed
and timing for the proper execu-
tion of the Wishbone offense. . .
They. therefore concentrated on
their inside game coupled with

- counter drives up the middle.

This was evident to Pitt’s head
football coach Carol DePasquale.
as he commented, “We need to do
a lot more work on timing. We
had to be able to do a lot more
running than we did.”

Inexperience was also harmful
to the gridders DePasqua indicat-
ed. "There’s no question about

it. people got jittery on us. It'll,

take time to develop confidence
. and poise."

Blessed Are
  The Spot Upon

by VINCE Di NARDO
. Sports Editor _
There were not reports that any Pitt football player was
spat upon after Saturdays opener against Florida State at Pitt

- Stadium.
The Panthers received a semi-standing ovation -at half time‘

time and marched off the field with their first loss of the season
at. game’s end, but some of the gridders heads weren’t looking
down. Especially the defensive unit. Their heads should have
been looking at the sky with pride instead.

For the defensive unit did a great job against a touted All-

_ American quarterback and atop 20 rated team.

The defensive unit gave the Pitt many occasion to eject sali-
vary juice on the pavement surrounding the home of the Pan-
thers last year, by allowing an astronomical 388 points (35 a
ﬁrmer *

Before the game it was said that if Pitt were to win it would
have to come up with a strong defensive effort. The effort came.

-but the offense left their precision and sharpness in the locker
room and it was they who hung their heads.

The only thing‘ the wishbone did against the Seminoles was
take up a lot of time and gain a sufficient amount of rushing
yardage» (55 attempts for 187 yards and a 3.4 per average). The

bad the chances, but no points. _ 1

The defensive unit sacked Huff five times

‘ fully let him get untracked as he supposedly
‘1 can. They-allowed Huff to complete 11 of 24
{ passes. but most of them were shorties. Twice
when they did blunder it cost them. as Huff
found his receivers open for 54 and 71 yard
, touchdown passes. Take those two bombs away
and the meager offense would have just man-
aged a 7-6 victory. One hundred and twenty-
five of Huff's 242 passing yards came on these
two plays.

 

. BUCKMON

Excellent performances were turned in by defensive end
James Buckmon and George Fehe at linebacker. -

Buckmon got to Huff three times by himself and Feher in-
tercepted a Huff pass and just missed another one at the goal
line. He also recovered a loose FSU ball in their backfield.

Granted, the Florida State rushing game is regarded as its
weak point, but the Pitt defenders allowed only 69 yards in 35

Q9!‘

In preparing for the opening clash the Pitt coaches were
saying that it-would be nice if the defense wouldn’t have to
open against such an offensive powerhouse. -They would have
liked the defense to get their feet on the ground against a lesser
foe._ The defensive squad didn’t trip over their feet Saturday af-
ternoon. Their performance left some hope that this will be a

Of course, they will still have to prove that they intend to
be consistent. If Pitt intends on having any kind of a year this
will be a prerequisite. A little defensive consistency never hurt
any football team.

Even though Simon and Garfunkel proclaim that the spat
upon are blessed. the defensive unit. most of which are return-
ers fromlast year, might want to disagree. There was nothing

Huff’s inability to connect early
in the contest was due to Pitt’s
aggressive defensive play, stop-
ping the Seminoles from making
a first down for the first 20 min-
utes of play. ‘

This defensive show was high-
lighted by linebacker George
Feher‘s interception of a Huff
aerial on the Seminoles third

Starting on their own 33 yard

yards in seven plays. Although
Hogan is primarily a dropback
passer, it was his running that
kept the scoring drive alive.

Although DePasqua was more ‘I

his defensive unit, he realizes
that his offense must acquire

The excitement created by the
Panther drive was quickly

Monroe Hopes For

 
 

Pro Diamonds

Rick Monroe is a typical college sophomore
who is often indecisive about what courses to take
or what his major should be, but a typical in the fact
that he knows exactly what he wants from his fu-
ture.

' He wants what most Little Leaguers dream of
and that is to play professional baseball; a dream
he hopes to fullfill.

Monroe is only 19 years of age and has three
more years of varsity baseball ahead of him at Pitt.
According to reports, these may be his springboard
to success. ‘

Monroe will never be mistaken for a Rhodes
Scholar, but then how many people are? He is an
average student, who was a standout in both base-
ball and basketball at Peabody High School under
the tutorship of two Western Pennsylvania’s finest
(Norm Frey and Keith McDonough) .

Monroe lettered four times for Peabody ‘as he
helped to lead them to an unprecedented fourth
straight City Baseball title. V

Monroe, at age 18, came to Pitt fresh from a
tryout with the Pittsburgh Pirates. He was told by
the Buc’s Assistant Scouting Director Meyerl Hess
to go to school and the Pirates would follow his pro-
gress, which had the same meaning as "don’t call
us we'll call you.” '

Monroe, not discouraged, chose Pitt over Point
Park, Indiana State, Slippery Rock, and Clarion. He

To Meet

decided on Pitt because, he said, “It offered me the
type of athletic program which can be beneficial to
a future in baseball.”

The mitter was highly impressed with Coach
Bob Lewis and many of the Pitt teams of the past.
He would like to follow in the footsteps of former
PanthersGeorge Medich and Ken Macha, but first
would like to prove himself on collegiate level.

This summer was a satisfying one for Monroe
as he led the Pittsburgh Forrfesters to the City-
County League title and then on to fourth place in
the national tournament at Johnstown, Pa. He car-
ried a .352 batting average and supplied the team
with several game-winning hits.

Last year, in Rick’s debut as a Panther against
New York University, he drove in the winning run,
although he never manned a regular spot in the line-
up. This year Monroe will. be able to play any posi-
tion on the field and play them all well.

A compactly built athlete, Monroe’s most note-
worthy assets are his strong arm on defense and his
consistency at the plate.

Lewis feels that Monroe should comeinto his
own this year after watching him play behind Andy
Livingston last season. Even though he was just a
freshman playing the role of pinchhitter, he was not
satisfied.

“Any guy satisfied to play second fiddle,” Mon-
roe claims, “lacks confidence in his own abilities".

O JUST LIKE YOU SEE ON TV

The first weekend of the college
football season has already pro-
duced some upsets that should
leave the AP and UPI sportswrit-

. ers baffled.

Fifth ranked Arkansas was sur-
prised by USC, 31-10, Saturday
night. Senior quarterback Mike
Rae and tailback Rod McNeil led
the eighth-ranked Trojans in their
upset.

Defensing national champion
and number one rated Nebraska
received a setback to’ their hopes
as they were upset by UCLA in
the closing minute of the game.
Kicker Efren Herrera booted a 29
yard field goal with 22 seconds left
to give the Bruins a 20-17 Victory.

“Like every collegiate football coach. Larry Jones of Florida State
has/a perenial problem with his squad. Coach Joneshas the hard task
of finding back up personnel for his 22 starters. So does Pitt boss

 Carl DePasqua. But, poor. poor Larry.

Why the sarcasm? Well. with the institution of the freshman eligi-
ble rule this year Jones had only 147 players to choose from to find his
44 first and second line players. Jones had 102 returning players to
go along with his 47 freshmen recruits.

“With 28 returning lettermen. we have a good chance of being a

‘  V good football team. It’s whether or not we can come
up with some depth in a number of key positions.
It’s the same old depth problem since we didn‘t
come up with a lot of help from our freshman
squad.

If Jones job of finding depth is hard, then De-
Pasqua’s is impossible. Pitt has only 95 players to
come up with a football team—that includes the
freshmen crop of 24 recruits.

  

Of course, Jones is in a position at Florida
State to plan ahead for his depth. unlike DePasqua.
For at Florida State, Jones can redshirt freely. On the present FSU
roster there are 12 redshirts. Last year the Seminoles were stacked in
the offensive backfield. They had the services of fellows named Magal—
ski, Munroe, Jarret, Roberts, Oreair, Brown. and Mitchell. So what
does-Jones do, build for ’72 and redshirt Mack Brown and Hodges Mitch-

ell—Saturdays starting backfield. Jones has Fred Geisler, a promising .

quarterback prospect.) redshirted to save him for when Gary Huff isn‘t
around any more.

That’s a fine situation to be in. Pitt doesn’t do that because they .

have higher principles——made possible by the Big Four Agreement—,
which say that Pitt can win without accessive scholarship spending.
with recruiting 24 frosh gridders, without voluntary redshirting.

That’s_ like challenging the neighborhood bully and blindfolding
yourself before the fight. Yet, Pitt meets eight bullies a year, who do
all of the above rather freely.

It’s unfair though to take out anxieties on Jones. who had nothing
but nice things to say about Pitt football and the city of Pittsburgh.
Pitt that has chosen its course. though different from that of the South-
ern powerhouse.

It would take DePasqua two years to equal the Seminole recruit
and redshirt output. Under the agreement that he is bound to. he can
only recruit 25 players a year and redshirt 20 players over a four year
period—ten medical and ten miscellaneous redshirts.

The job for Jones wasn’t as hard last year. He had 42——that’s right
42—redshirts to help him find his depth. This year he only had 12.

Poor, poor Carl DePasqua.

These Are The Answers Of American Enterprise...

. . . “As in the past, we are continuing to hire a large number
of ROTC graduates. We do give specific consideration to the ex-
tend and type of an applican’ts military experience in arriving
at an initial starting salary.”
CARL H. HAGEMAN, Vice President
Union Carbide Corporation

.  “College seniors who have ROTC obligations are encour-
aged to accept employment with RCA even though they may be
called to active duty within a few months after graduation."
These young men bring to the Company a maturity, a sense of
values, and a willingness to accept responsibility usually not
found in youngmen who enter business directly upon gradua-
tion.” I
A. H. EVANS, Director, Employment
Radio Corporation of America ’ I

. . . “Without qualification, I think it can be said that an ROTC:
graduate . . . represents a certain asset to any industrial or-
ganization. Many of our locations actively participate in recruit-
ment at separation centers and the fact that we think ROTC
training is an asset should be no secret.”

~ R. F. FOSTER, Director of Personnel Administration
' FMC Corporation

 

   Preferred Graduate?  

I

. . . “We feel ROTC graduates enhance their long-range career
development as a result of profitable military experience. Cer-
tainly gaining and holding a commission is a dedicated advan-
tage. With this added maturity the individual can assume great-
er responsibilities earlier in his civilian career-development
time span.” —

- H. E. GESSLER, Vice President
Kaiser Aluminum and Chemical Corps.

. . . “I can say quite confidently that we consider ROTC men to
be excellent employment prospects. They generally bring with
them a job maturity and leadership qualities that often acceler-
ate their personal development and consequently their advance-
ment within our company.” ' . A
C. D. KISSLER, Employment Manager
Uniroyal, Inc.

. . . “I am convinced that industry’s view of ROTC training is
similar to ours which is that ROTC training is an invaluable
asset weighed heavily in all employment considerations. We
have found that ROTC students are well on the road in achieving
the proper blending of leadership and management skills with
their formaleducation and in that sense they are much ahead of
their contemporaries who will enter industry upon graduation.”

JOHN B. LAWSON, Executive Vice President
Philco-Ford Corporation

American enterprise recognizes the greater potential of ROTC graduates and has developed attitudes of
preference for these men in recruiting for their management cadres. NOW is the time for you to insure

that you will be a PREFERRED graduate.
