Fund Aids
Union

By ANN O'CONNOR ‘

A special projects division with
Development and Alumni Affairs is
undertaking the task of raising $5
million to maintain the condition of
the newly-renovated William Pitt
Union.

The effort to establish an endow-
ment fund towards this end, dubbed
“Putting on the Ritz,” will include
several reunions informing Pitt
alumni of the effort and will culmi-
nate in The Grand Ball, 3 horse-
drawn carriage affair for all
contributors.

Mary Beth Correnti, coordinator
of the William Pitt Union Endow-
ment campaign, said, however, that
the venture is not geared exclusively
towards Pitt alumni. Particularly,
she said she hopes various civic
groups in Oakland will contribute to
the fund due to the historic signifi-
cance of the building itself.

in the meantime, the special pro-
jects division is proceeding with
plans to hold a series of reunions for
donors to the Annual Giving Fund,
faculty and staff and select student
organizations.

Board
Holds First

Meeting

In the first meeting of the new
term, the Student Government
Board last night approved a recom-
mendation for the allocation of over
$2,000 for the Senator Paul Tsongas
to speak at Pitt’s Law Day .

Law Day, sponsored by the Pre-
Law Society in conjunction with the
Career Counseling Center,will be
held on September 28, and Senator
Tsongas is tentatively scheduled to
speak on the 29th. The $2,225
approved by the board will pay for
Tsongas’ transportation to and from
Pittsburgh, hotel accommodations
and honorarium.

In other Board business, member
Mindy Goldberg reported that 22
students showed up for the introduc-
tory session of the Law School
Admissions Test prep course. She
expects 10 more students to register
for the course, which means it would
have to be given in two separate
classes.

The board is also working to

'revive the defunct internship office.

A number of alternatives are being
considered,and a decision is
expected to be made soon concern-
ing the office.

Nobel Prize-Winner In Physics Lectures At Pitt

Hans Bethe, one of the original
nuclear fathers who worked at Los
Alamos and won the i967 Nobel
Prize in physics, visited Pitt this
week and gave two insightful lec-
tures on stars and atomic weapons.

Bethe won his Nobel Pize for the
discovery of how stars burn. He also
worked with the Eisenhower
Administration on the science coun-
cil and was also a delegate in the late
'50s to peace talks in Switzerland.

The lecture given on Monday was
entitled “The Life Cycle of the
Stars." Tuesday’s lecture was
entitled “Nuclear Disarmament and
Star Wars Technology.”

Bethe spoke in his second lecture
specifically about the current devel-
opments in the arms race and
expressed an insider's View of the
horror of nuclear war.

“The only way to deal with
nuclear war is not to have it," Bethe
said. “Whoever makes the first strike
will dominate for a half hour.”

Bethe went into numbers of wea-
pons posessed by each side and said
that the Soviets have an advantage
in the number of ground-based mis-
siles and the total number of mis-
siles, but the US, with its high
number of submarine-based war-
heads, has a tactical advantage.

The raw numbers were presented
on slides, and the bottom line for the
two superpowers was 1,962 war-
heads for the US and 2,470 war-

heads for the USSR. Bethe
commented that the USSR has a
slight advantage in the number of
bombs but a large edge in the
amount of explosive power they
possess.

Bethe detailed his lecture on how
different types of weapons operate
and painted a grim picture by say-
ing, “What matters is not the
number of bombs but the number of
warheads. If only a fraction of the
bombs were used, both the US and
the USSR would be bombed into the
Stone Age.”

Bethe spoke on many parts ofthe
Reagan nuclear policy and focused
specifically on the MX-missile and
aspects of its being deployed in
Western Europe.

“We wouldn’t want to put missiles
in a potential target place as popu-
lated as Pittsburgh, where you
would make many people targets.”

He explained that the Americans
will deploy the smaller MX that has
a great deal more accuracy, but the
Russians will use the “very big mis-
siles that don’t have to hit accu-
rately.” He also stated that the
Russians would switch bigger mis-
siles for smaller ones, “but once a
military force has a weapon, it
doesn’t give it up.”

Conventional targets for most
current nuclear analysts are cities
and missile sites. Bethe proposed
that instead of these sites, military

targets of the “old kind,” munitions
dumps, rail yards and military out-
posts should be attacked so that the
nuclear target country is left vulner-
able and innocent lives are spared.

“Reagan has coined an obscene
name for the MX: The Peace

Yesterday was the last day to Add/ Drop and a large Number of students waited to the last

Maker,” he said. “We shouldn‘t
build up; there is no way to win an
arms race. You can only win
temporarily.”

Bethe also spoke about the latest
developments in weapons technol-
ogy and gave information on

particle-beam weapons. He also
spoke about his own work with this
technology. .
He said attempts to shoot down
missiles after they have been
launched go back 20 years,but in the

Alumni Affairs, said that various

groups which had used the student

union extensively from I960 to 1975

will be invited to Pitt for cocktails, a

tour of the William Pitt Union and a

group picture. Afterward, the

alumni will be informed of the Char-

itable Giving Through Life Insur-
ance Program, the means chosen by
the university to raise the endow-
ment fund.

More specifically, the life insur-
ance funding program would have
contributors buy life insurance poli-
cies that would grow and even be
invested by the insurance company,
according to Jack Freeman, senior
vice chancellor for the administra-
tion.

Freeman said that upon the death
of the individual, the university
becomes the beneficiary of the
contribution.

Caye added that the monthly pay-
ments towards the life insurance are
tax deductible for the donor and is
advantageous for both the contribu-
tor and Pitt.

As for the rationale necessitating
an endowment fund, Freeman
points to a problem confronting the
university and details the obstacle as
essentially two-fold.

“It is very difficult to get people to
pay for bricks and mortar because

they prefer to contribute to pro-
grams,” Freeman said.

The majority of Pitt's living
alumni graduated just recently so

the university does not have the lux-
ury of a backlog of older, very suc-
cessful alumni upon whom to rely
for donations. So Pitt had to go
ahead with the renovation regard-
less of the absence of private funds.

As a result, the administration
came to the decision that resources
must be accumulated now to main-
tain the condition of the union later,
especially in light of the previous
commitment to renovation. Cor-
renti said the life insurance endow-
ment program will allow the average
person to participate and even
receive a memorial plaque in a desig-
nated area of the William Pitt
Union. The modest sums people give
now, said Freeman, will become
large gifts over time.

Pitt students might wonder how
the William Pitt Union funding
drive will affect tuition in the
upcoming years. Freeman said that
the renovation, not the upkeep, has
already been reflected in the tuition
base over the past few years, and he
maintains that the current problem
is merely sustaining the quality of
the building with foresight and fund
raising now.

Correnti describes the effort to
reach the $5 million mark through
the endowment program as a “once
in a lifetime opportunity.” Correnti
said she is hopeful that the special
projects division will reach its goal.
“lndividuals must recognize that
more money to support action of
this kind would take less out of the
current operating budget and there-
by allow more for other university
programs,” Freeman said.

slower than the big ones with
warheards.

The modern beam weapons reach
the velocity of light, and the large
missiles can take no evasive action
against them.

Bethe commented on Reagan's
March statement on this subject and
said that mutually assured safety
could possibly come about with the
development of these weapons.

Both of the lectures were open to
the university community and were
well received.

Peter Winter, chairman of the
anesthesiology department, said, “It
is a real privilege to have him here.

He is really a towering figure in

American science."

Winter had the duty of introduc-
ing Bethe. In his introduction, he
said Bethe was imminently qualified
to make these lectures. He then went
on to highlight some of Bethe’s
accomplishments, including a spe-
cial award from President Kennedy
and work with many famous scient-
ists, among them Bohr and Fermi.

Bethe graduated from the Univer-
sity of Munich in 1938 and hasgbeen a
distinguished faculty member at
Cornell University for most of his
life. His obvious expertise in the

scientific community made him a,

speaker not to be forgotten.

Heart
Disease
Studied

Heart disease, the number one
cause of death in post-menopausal
women, is the focus of a five-year
investigation which begins this Sep-
tember through the Graduate
School of Public Health, University
of Pittsburgh.

Over $1 million from the National
Heart, Lung and Blood Institute has
been awarded to Pittsburgh to sup-
port this first longitudinal study to
determine what riskfactors cause
the rapid rise in heart disease in
women after menopause.

“Although extensive research has
been carried out on cardiovascular
risk factors in men, this has not been
true for women. Our research is par-
ticularly relevant since the average
lifespan of women in the U.S. is now
77 years - resulting in one-third of
a woman’s lifetime being spent after
menopause, when she is most
vulnerable to heart disease,” said
Karen Matthews, Ph.D principal
investigator, assistant professor of
psychiatry and epidemiology of this
project.

*IsPitt Still A ‘FootballSchool’?

By JOHN GAMBESCIA

A topic of some concern this sea-
son was the raising of the student
home football-tic ket price from $5 to
$9. Some people thought that this
price hike would affect student
attendance at home football games,
while others saw it as just another
way for the administration to bleed
the students of their money. How-

,ever, this year’s preseason student

ticket sales were not- much higher
than those of this year. The ’82 pre-
season ticket sales totalled approxi-
mately $9,000, while the ’83
preseason sales dropped only a
small percentage —— to approxi-
mately $8,700. The $4 increase
hasn’t affected sales too drastically.

Although the ’83 sales are a little
behind the ’82 sales, the final mea-
sure of participation will be the total
number of tickets sold. Do the fans,
students and non-students, want to
see football as much this year as in

wprevious years? We will have to wait

and find out.

August 14, 1983 marked the
opening day of the Panthers’ fall
training camp. Some 110 players
travelled to Edinboro, Pa., to spend
11 days practicing hard-hitting and
game strategy in hopes of leaving
there with an attitude that reﬂected
their young but strong football
squad. The team wanted to show
itself and the fans that even though it
wasn’t made up of the same players,
it was made up of the same tradition.

The Panthers have a total of 27
returning lettermen, but only 8 1/2
of them are starters (4 1/2 offense, 4
defense, 2 kickers). Their strong
points include a winning tradition
and strong running back and defen-
sive end postitions, while their areas
of concern include the QB position,
an inexperienced tight end and the
replacements of on the offensive
and defensive lines. The question is:
Will Pitt still be recongized as a dom-
inant football school? .

“In the seven years l’ve been
here,” said head coach Foge Fazio,
“this year’s camp was the hardest,
both mentally and physically. In
order to win, we have to be mentally
tough and disciplined.”

Fazio also revealed this year’s
appropriate training-camp slogan:
Count On Me In ’83. “There will be a
total commitment on their [the play-
ers’] part, and when they are called
on, they are expected to respond,”
said Fazio.

John Congemi, Pitt’s new starting
QB, is one of the main players to put
Fazio’s “Count On Me In ’83” slogan
to use. He was called on to lead the
Pitt offense down the field and put
six on the board while doing so.

‘‘I’m not doing it alone,” said Con-
gemi. “I have 10 other guys helping
me on offense and 11 guys on
defense.”

Senior All-America candidate
Tom Flynn is the only remaining
starter from the famous Pitt defense
of 1980. In the free safety position
last season, Flynn managed 82 tac-
kles (54 solos, 28 assists) in merely
10 games. He also led the Panther
return men with 254 yards on 28
punt returns.

“Our offense has come a long way
since the spring,” said Flynn, “and
they’ve proved they can put points
on the board.” Being a local boy, a
graduate of Penn Hills High School.
Flynn was able to closely watch the
development of Pitt’s football pro-
gram. When asked if Pitt was still a

football school even though many
starters had graduated, Flynn re-

plied, “Pittsburgh is a football town,
and with all the fans rallying around
the team, I can see no reason why
we can’t come out on top.”

Bill Maas, senior defensive tackle
from Newtown Square, Pa., has
come to be recognized as one of the
great defensemen Pitt has produced
over the ear.

AT

o‘iI 5.

‘‘It’s everybody’s goal to bring
home a nat'ional championship;
being a ball player at Pitt, you don't
go on the field without a dream of a
championship,” Maas said. “Pitt is
still going to go out there and play
football, and we're still going to win.”

Pitt students obviously think
Pitt’s a winner, too, Maas believes,
judging from the number of presea-
son tickets sold and the excitement
generated at last Saturday's game.

Student leader and SGB repre-
sentative Barry Greene said, “I
don't think the price raise will have
any significant effect on student par-
ticipation; there has always been a
lack of student participation here at
Pitt, but football always seems to be
the sport that prevails in
attendance.

‘‘I’m more excited by far this year;
every game is a major victory
because nobody expected us to be
where we are now.”

Senior student Steve Russo, a
local from Butler, Pa., has also been
following Pitt football for a number
of years now.

“Pitt has only given up three
points so far, so we know that they
are still a hard hitting, winning
team,” Russo said. “The Panthers
are what I call a sleeper team; they
are not expected to be a great
power house, but at the same time
they can do some real damage.”

Bill Maas summed it up when
asked to describe Pitt football in one
word—enthusiastic.

Can Pitt students ask for anything
more? Pitt is only a team, and it goes
through changes like any other
organization. The fans did not
expect the Panthers to be where
they are now — UPI has ranked
them number 11. With the enthusi-
asm of which Maas speaks and the
endless potential of the young team,
the Panthers cannot help but to
keep its strongfootball tradition.

What
Next?

The U.S. peace-keeping force currently in Lebanon
is under fire both at home and in the war-torn country
itself. Four Marines have died in recent weeks, and
three more were wounded this week. These troops
have also come under fire by some members of Con-
gress who think the Marines have no right to be there

in the first place.

Since the minds of many Americans have been
turned toward Korean Air Line Flight 007 that was
shot down two weeks ago by the Soviet Union, the
Marines in Lebanon have not been getting a lot of
attention, even though members of this “peace-

keeping” force have been killed.

There also has been talk of Congress implementing
the War Powers Act of 1973. The law, written into the
Constitution after the Vietnam War, states that the
president must consult Congress before sending
troops abroad and to report to Congress when the
troops will be put “into hostilites or situations where

imminent
indicated.”

involvement in hostilities is clearly

If hostilities do erupt while U.S. troops are abroad,
the president must bring the troops home within.90
days unless Congress declares war or gives permission
to the president to let the troops fight.

The Marines in Lebanon are most assuredly in a
hostile situation, and as of yesterday, the U.S. Navy is

also involved.

President Reagan and Congress now have some
important decisions to make. They have to work
together to determine whether the lives of U.S. citizens
are worth the price of keeping the Lebanese govern-

ment in power.

In addition to that, a Constitutional issue is also
involved. Reagan has to decide soon whether to keep
the troops in Lebanon without the permission ofCon—
gress or invoke the War Powers Act and receive offi-

cial permission.

The next few days and weeks will be a test period not
only for U.S. foreign policy but also an act of Congress
that will more than likely set the stage for decisions in

the years to come.

Hopefully, our country's leaders will be able to
make the right decisions where America is concerned.
Hopefully, there will be no more Americans killed in
Lebanon. Hopefully, Reagan will go the route of ask-
ing for permission before making any large decisions.

Hopefully.

Although this an unrealistic attitude to take towards
the situation, the issue is too complex to warrant easy
solutions and answers. The upcoming future of the
troops in Lebanon and the country is now in the hands

of a select few in Washington.

The only thing we can do is wait and hope.

Letters To The Editor ,,

RA Explains Alcohol Policy

Dear Editor:

I have written several times to The.

Pitt News about the problem of
irresponsible journalism. When the
facts are reported wrong or names
are used or, in extreme cases, when
facts are not even looked at in
expressing opinions, not only is the
author made to look like a fool but
also the responsibility and credibil-
ity of the paper is severely under-
mined. With a new editor in charge
of the paper, I thought maybe a new
attitude would emerge.

With i the August 31 editorial,
“Slapping Our Hands,” 1 can only
begin to think that this is not so. But,
I will not close my mind and think
The Pitt News editors cannot
change, unlike themselves who
already closed their eyes to the uni-
versity’s newest alcohol policy with-
out fully understanding when, how
and for what reasons the policy
came about they have damned it
“archaic and unfair.” Also, they
have resorted to name-calling in
labelling RAs and RDs henchmen. I
take this as an affront. I am no one’s
henchman. I was hired to do thisjob
after a long process of screening. But
I am not forced to do my job. I can
quit at any time and did consider
quitting upon learning of the new
alcohol policy. But I chose upon
consideration of the policy not to, it
gave me major problems with my
values.

This is coming to you from a man

' who once wrote to The Pitt News

about seeing bats and lizards at The
Luna after a night of beer drinking. I
am no prude when it comes to hoist-
ing a few beers. But I also realized
there existed on campus a problem
that needed addressing.

Residents’

Dear Editor:

First, I would like to say how
great it is to hear from Pitt’s resident
expert on The Who‘s(a rock and roll
band, for those who don't know) lyr-
ics. Second. in response to the
column “An Old Problem Resurfa-
ces,“ I have something to mention
that Miss Clinton neglected to
mention.

What about the South Oakland
residents point of view’? South Oak-
land is a residential area. Those'of us
who-live here have cars. and'thanks
to the residential permit system
recently implemented. we can now
park our cars on the streets where we
**‘:‘?».*1“.‘”E€f*.<’, .“.".".‘~3‘1*‘.*? totisht 0”

The previous alcohol policy was
ambiguous and difficult to enforce,
each person could interpret it in his
way. Talk about unfair! Also, great
amounts of damages were occurring
in the residence halls with much ofit
resulting from alcohol-related
events. If students cannot be respon-
sible for their actions by themselves,
maybe some responsibilty needs to
be thrust upon them.

Now for some facts: Three sepa-
rate committees were set up to study
and recommend guidelines fora pol-
icy. Every aspect of student life was

 

represented including RSA (the
president) and SGB. The resulting
policy was a composite ofthese com-
mittees’ results. Surprisingly, each
group’s results were very similar.
And, by the way, a random poll was
taken of students tojudge their reac-
tions. The reason for implementing
the new. policy in September, thus
making it appear as ifit were slipped
in over the summer, was that oftime
frame and ease. Can anyone imagine
how difficult it would be to imple-
ment any type of policy in the middle

vultures like the author of Monday’s
column.

In reference to the statement that

C10’ i3XP3Y€rS are not permitted to
park on the streets for which they
pay. The permit is designed to
ensure that the city taxpayer and res-
ident may park on the street for
which he pays. By the way Miss
Clinton, since you live too far away
from Oakland to ride the bus just
how much in taxes do you pay a
year’?

As for the “hundreds" of teacher's
cars that were not supposed to be
there. let's be realistic. Those are
public parking spaces and those
teachers have just as much right to
park there as you do. In regard to

those special prjyugge_., af{0{d_€d_m€_   _ 

of the school year?

I was here when the old policies
were in effect and remember times
knowing how lax the policies were
and then going ahead and doing
something that the next day I was
none too proud ofdoing. Maybe it is
time to try and develop more
responsibilty among us. The times
we face ahead are complex and dan-
gerous and will require a great deal
of responsibility on all our parts,
even now. It is not something that
comes automatically with age or
graduation. Responsibilty is an
acquired skill.

In‘ closing, I would like to add a
few thoughts. Penn State and the
Pennsylvania State schools have
much stricter rules concerning alco-
hol in the residence halls. This is not
a justification, it is only to help set
things in perspective. This policy
will in no way eliminate informal
gatherings. Most I see and
remember do not involve alcohol.
The RAs, RDs and office personnel
in ORL and Student Affairs realize
students will still drink in the resi-
dence halls, 21 years of age or not.
The intention is not to make this a

0

dry campus. The intention is to try ‘

to promote responsible drinking
habits; alcoholism and problem
drinking are major problems. It be-
gins here. We do not need to exacer-
bate it. We are all here for an
education both in and out of the
classroom. Remember, have fun but
play safe.

Depression: Going Down on the Escalator of Life

By JULIA STITELY

Depression. Everyone suffers
from it at one time or another. It
ranges from a mild case of the
“blues” to a severe depression,
sometimes leading to suicide.

Depression hits college students,
especially freshmen, hard. Many are
living away from home for the first
time, away from familiar surround-
ings and old friends. Students may
feel a loss of belonging until new
friendships are developed.

For many students, though, the
first weeks are a breeze. Serious
problems set in later when they real-
ize that college isn’t summer camp
and they’re really here to stay.
Going away to school marks the end
of a person’s role as a child in the
family, according to Reverend Orin
Camp of Contact Pittsburgh, a 24-
hour hotline.

Often college life doesn’t meet a
person’s expectations. Status and
popularity in high school mean
nothing now, and straight-A stu-
dents may find they have to take a
cut in grades. Identities are being
challenged and values questioned.
A period of insecurity is inevitable
for everyone.

Depression, however, is not the
exclusive property of freshman.
Upperclassmen suffer from depres-
sion, too. According to Camp, com-
petition, concern over careers and
the job market, family pressures to
succeed, personal relationships and
the fear of not meeting expectations
causes much depression in
upperclassmen.

opment Center, said the center sees
a “relatively large” number of
depressed students at Pitt, more in
the fall and winter seasons than at
any other time of the year. He also
noted that hospitals and mental
institutions receive more patients in
the winter.

Depression, although a condition
of the mind, often manifests itself
physically. A depressed person
often suffers loss of appetite and
sleep disturbances. He may sleep
longer, yet is never fully rested,
causing irritability.

The symptom Camp stressed,
however, is withdrawal. The person
may be moody and speak slowly.
There is less “richness and fluctua-
tion” in his speech and he sounds
tired.

Other, more obvious signs of
depression are a tendency to tears,
declining grades and deteriorating
personal appearance. But if vou see
these symptoms don’t pack yourself
or your roommate off yet. Duration
and persistence of symptoms are
the difference between a blue mood
and a “clinical depression,” Bow-
man said.

Most depression is treated thera-
peutically. Professional counselors
are trained to talk with depressed
people and help them straighten out
problems. There are many sources
of professional help available in this
area.

On campus, the University Coun-
seling Center (third ﬂoor, Wm. Pitt
Union) has staff prepared to discuss
any problem. There are also various

hotlines, such as Contact Pitts-
burgh, always ready to help.

If you suspect a friend or room-
mate is depressed, talk with him.
Depressed people often feel that
they are alone and that no one
cares. Learning that someone is
concerned may be all that is needed.
If the problem is more serious,
encourage them to seek help.

It’s difficult to anticipate depres-
sion, but it’s vital for students to
understand that life dishes out good
and bad indiscriminately. There are
people and resources available and
it’s “okay to seek help,” Camp said.
Self-awareness is important to rec-
ognize when bad days stretch into
bad weeks and months.

Pitt Goes

'For Three
In A How

By MIKE SIBERINI
The Pitt soccer team (2-2) will
be looking to extend its current
winning streak to three games
when it travels to Latrobe to take
on St. Vincent (l-1) tonight.
Although Pitt coach Leo

‘X19 Bemis has thoughts of a victory,

. he admits the Bearcats always
offer a tough match. Last season,
Pitt’s West Penn Conference
rivals took a 2-0 decision on their
way to an ll-l-1 season and a
berth in the N.A.I.A. (National
Association of Interscholastic
Athletics) playoffs.

“They play a good, aggressive,
tough type of soccer, and they're
very tough at St. Vincent,” Bemis
said. “Additionally, we’re Pitt,
and everyone goes after us. We’re
kind of the big frog in the
puddle.”

This will be the Bearcats’ first
conference game after an open-
ing win over Walsh College (3-2
in overtime) and a loss to Juniata

(1-0). V‘

“We’re not as strong as we
were last year,” St. Vincent
coach John Granish said. “We
depend on six seniors and their
leadership ability to pull the
team through.”

Booters Tackle St. Vincent; Former Player Returns

Komoroski Hustles To Present,

By SCOTT DELLETT

Last winter, Greg Komoroski
was longing for the past. A year
before, he was playing midfield
for the St. Vincent soccer team, a
NAIA power. But his academic
career came before soccer, and
Komoroski transferred to Pitt.
An itch for soccer came during
the fall term as the Bearcats fin-
ished ll-l-I and at one time
ranked sixth in the nation. With .
pressures from a demanding
physical therapy major creeping
up on him, the rolling hills of
Latrobe seemed like heaven.

With some help from close
friends, Komororski avoided the
temptation of return to the deep
Catholic roots of St. Vincent and
stayed on at Pitt. Tonight, he
makes a visit to Latrobe to face
some of his former teammates.

It could have been possible
that Komoroski would have to
face Pitt in a Bearcat uniform.

“Around Christmas time last
year, I considered transferring
back to St. Vincent,” he said. “St.
Vincent had a good season, and I
had problems academically.

“In fact, I had resigned from
the university. After the first day
of classes, some friends called
and asked why I wasn’t in class. I

even with the successful record.

was living on past memories. My
friends convinced me to live in
the present.”

Komoroski's past was filled
with success in soccer. However,
it was not due to outstanding tal-
ent. Instead it has been due to the
Puritan ethic — hard work.

“I don’t have the skills,” he
admitted. “I play more aggres-
sively than others. The assistant
coach at St. Vincent called me
‘The Workhorse’ because I
always give I00 percent out on
the field. For example, at St.
Vincent, we had to run an obsta-
cle course. I came in first, run-
ning it under two minutes. The
coach really liked that.”

St. Vincent soccer coach John
Grandish would liked to have
Komoroski on last year’s team,

“Greg would have been a tre-
mendous asset to the team last
year," he said. “He was a valuble
part of the team. He was dedi-
cated. Greg would run two miles
every game, going after balls.
Even if he would make one suc-
cessful tackle every five tries, his
hustle would spark the rest ofthe
team up. They see him work and
get involved.’ He never gave up.”

Louisville, Penn State Headline Classic

By MARK A. SINDLER

When Lady Panther’s volleyball
coach Shelton Collier formulated
his 1983 schedule earlier last year, the
Pitt Classic, scheduled to begin Fri-

day night, was designed to be just‘

what its title implied — a tourna-
ment featuring schools who are no
strangers to Top 20 rankings.

As it is, the four-team, round
robin-type setup will likely turn out
smelling far from a rose. Soggy
cornflakes is more in the
neighborhood.

Playing in the field house on Fri-
day and Saturday will be Penn
State, Louisville and, for the first
time, Florida State.

Respiration is still detected in one
squad that is entering town barely
above .500. Another teamjust lost a
key hitter against rinky-dink team in
a game that was played last week-
end. And yet one more team will
arrive with an undefeated record.

Obviously, that is the exception,
far from the rule. Yet the rule states
that upbeat endings can be detected

in most stories. Henceforth, there
remains capsule, merry-go-round
summaries of those teams which fig-
ure prominently in upsetting Pitt’s
10-0 brushfire start.

FLORIDA STATE

One need not talk to coach Cecile
Reynaud and still find out that she
resembles a deprived orphan.

“I never get up this way, so it
should be interesting," Reynaud
noted earlier in the week.

Reynaud is bringing a 10-player
roster up north later this week and
aims to be sure that her stay is an
enjoyable one. Even though it is a
first.

To date, the Lady Seminoles have
scrimmaged against “five medium-
talented teams” that have handed
them a 5-0 record. That came Labor

Day weekend when Louisiana State

entertained FSU. While there, Rey-
naud & Co. had an enjoyable time of
it, defeating Rice, Clemson, South-
ern University, New Orleans and the
hosts themselves, LSU.

It is that tournament that barely
seeps from Reynaud‘s mind.

“Last year, we played at LSU and
had a major injury," she recalled.
“After that, we never played well the
rest of the season. This year, we
started extremely strong, even beat-
ing Clemson, 15-0. -

“And we’re playing consistently;
almost everyone is healthy."

Reynaud’s big gun on the battle-
field points to 5-8 Karyn Palgut, an
outside hitter. Palgut will bejoined
by two other seniors, Sally Summer
and Julie Brown —- outside and mid-
dle hitters, respectively.

All are responsible for cranking
out the production in what Reynaud
half-jokingly refers to as a 5-2
offense. For those with facial groc-
ery bags. no such animal exists.

“We vary our offense between a
5—l and a 6-2,” Reynaud explained.
“It depends who’s on. It varies. Our
strongest setter is Marie Sanders

(another senior).

“It all depends on what we need.”

‘‘I know we’re going to have to
pass the ball very well,” Reynaud
said in anticipation of four more
match victories. “Hitting will take
care of itself.“

Presumably, Summer, Brown and
Palgut will be up to the task. FSU's
setting abilities remain question-
able.

query mired in the mysterious. The
Lady Cardinals currently retain a 7-

ona State tomorrow evening before
they even load the gear for their

“Being this early, we’ve made a lot
of mistakes against teams who are

this moment," Luster remarked.

- Lady Panthers Face ‘Interesting’ Year

By SCOTT DELLETT

Lady Panther tennis coach
George Dieffenbach summed-up the
situation best when describing the
I983 team.

“This is going to be an interesting
year,” he said.

With the loss of three of the top
six players, including No. 1 Cathy
Jacobsen and No. 2 Lisa LaFuria,
anyone can see why this year is going
to test Dieffenbach.

However, Dieffenbach was not
left empty-handed. Four players
with match experience return. It is
Dieffenbach’s job to develop and
hone the team into a winning unit.

“We have a lot of raw talent,"
Dieffenbach said. "We're doing our
best to develop the players. It’s a
challenge to mold this team."
Miriam Goltz is one of the four
returning letter-winners. Goltz has
been trying to play with a knee
sprain she suffered this summer, yet
it has not hindered her
improvement.

“Despite the injury, Miriam is
playing the best tennis in her career,“

Dieffenbach said. “Her endurance
during a long match is the question
mark with her. Can she win a three-
set match with her injury?"

Jodi Levine should match up with
Goltz to form an effective doubles
team. According to Dieffenbach,
Levine can be the top player for Pitt.

“Jodi has the potential to become
the best on the team," he said. “She
has good form, good pace on the ball
and consistency.

“But her problem has been she has
too many weapons. She doesn't
know when to use them. Ifshe works
on her concentration, she will be a
strong asset to the team."

Consistency is also the asset of
Kris Peckman. Dieffenbach said she
is the steadiest player on the team.

“Kris keeps the ball in play," he
said. “Her consistency drives her
opponents crazy.

“I count on her in singles play, and
her play in doubles has been
improving.”

Senior Jody Mattioli rounds out
the returning players. Her assets to

Pitt this year are her experience and
unselfishness.

“Jody is a strong team player,“
Dieffenbach said. “Her maturity
should pay off in her best year ever.

“She is hitting the ball the best she
ever has. She has good pace on her
strokes. She is a key to the team."

Team play will serve as an impor-
tant role to the Lady Panthers.

“We need to play as a unit," Dief-
fenbach said. “A lot of results will
depend on doubles."

A number six player would also
help Dieffenbach in filling out the
lineup. But the prospect of that is
suspect as players are filtered out
before the season opener against
Carnegie-Mellon on Saturday.

“Looking for a number six player
could be mission impossible," Dief-
fenbach said.

So may a repeat of last year’s 8-2
record. But success could still be in
Pitt's grasp.

“Our goal is to have a winning
record," Dieffenbach said. “We
would also like to finish better than
last place in the Big East.“

Hustle Gains Komoroski
Spot lnstarting Lineup

Continued from page seven

Pitt coach Leo Bemis has the
same evalation about Komo-
roski. “He’s been a steady out on
the field," he said. “He not a
standout in skills, but his hustle
stands out.”

In order to acquire skill in
soccer, one must learn at a young
age within an established soccer
program. Komoroski did not
have this luxury.

Interested in all sports, Komo-
roski played football during his
junior high days. But football
after that was only a dream.

“The football coach at North
Catholic sent a letter inviting me
to join. But I was only 5-2 and
102 pounds, and there was all
these big kids....”

Not wanting to sit around dur-
ing the fall, Komoroski joined
the newly-formed junior varsity
team at North Catholic. Unfor-
tunately, programs in their
infancy take a tremendous beat-
ing, and the North Catholic
“football rejects” were getting

regular beating of I2-0 by such
established WPIAL soccer
power such as North Allegheny,
Springdale and Fox Chapel.
That year, the team managed to
score only one goal.

“But the team was in good

spirits,” Komoroski said. “After _

all, we were getting a letter.”

There was a time when it
looked as though Komoroski
was not going to be on the Pitt
roster. Figuring early August
was time enough to try, Komo-
roski approached Bemis only to
find that the 30-man roster was
already filled.

“He told me to return the first
day of school and try out then,”
he said.

Bemis does not reget having
him. “Greg wanted a chance to
play one more year. He is a hus-
tling player doing his level best to
get the job done.”

Even though he gained expe-
rience playing with Pitt indoors
last winter, Komoroski still had
to adjust to the different style of

play between Pitt and St. Vin-
cent. The Bearcats play an
aggressive —— sometimes dirty,
according to Komoroski -— type
of soccer. The Panthers stress
skills.

“I hacked up three guys during
the first day of practice, and the
coach told me to calm down,” he
said. “Now, I'm not so reckless. I
try to balance aggressiveness and
skillful play.”

Komoroski has been looking
forward to tonight’s meeting
since transferring.

“Not many people have this
opportunity," he said.

Earlier, Komoroski met up
with some old teammates and an
assistant coach. After the usual
greetings, the assistant asked
Komoroski if he was playing for
Pitt.

After the positive response,
the assistant threatened jokingly,
“We’re going to send a couple
guys and break both your legs.”

Komoroski responded, “You
have to catch me.”

'C/assic Not A Bed Of Roses

?ontinued from page 7
20-school congregation. Those were
eight matches in three days and
included therein were big losses to
Western Michigan, S. lllinois
UCLA and the Lady Wildcats.

The following weekend Luster‘s
l0-player roster took second in a
Western Michigan tournament and
again missed the clutch effort

K against San Diego State.

u

“We're kind of in a state of fluc-
tuation," Luster said. “This (past)
weekend we played some good ball.
We saw some adjustments we're try-
ing to make. which is pretty nice."

Sure, it‘s nice, but is it conducive
to scraping up the wins? Holding the
key to those bolted-shut answers is
junior outside hitter Janet Crad-
dock. That is no help, Craddock
being held out till next weekend, due
to ligament problems, when Luster
travels to a Nebraska tournament.

Luster is noncommital over

"whether her absence will be a factor.

“Well, we haven‘t had her yet, so
you can't miss somebody you
haven‘t had," he said of his All-
Metro prize. “She‘s been one of our
primary hitters the last two years.
doing everything well."

As a result, Luster will start a
freshman and a sophomore in the
middle. And cross his fingers from
there.

‘ The reason there lies in the pro-
phecy that Luster senses an urgency

Panther

continued from page 7

One of those seniors is Jeff

1 Sheldon. a high-scoring striker.

He missed the Bearcats season

opener due to a case of blood
poisoning.

Sophomores Sean Smith, the
team's sweeper back, and central
midfielder Dean Zanella have
also shown their worth in the
early season contests. The
Panthers will remember Zanella
as one of the goal scorers in last
year's Pitt-St. Vincent game.

Bemis, who has taken advan-
tage of the free substitution rule
in a couple of Pitt's games, has
now had a chance to look at
some of his younger players.

Forwards Dave Van Newkirk,
Rich Godfrey and Bob Howard
and midfielder Todd Smith are
freshmen who have improved
steadily in recent weeks.

“They still have to find their
way and learn how to play
together as well as with the older
players," Bemis said. “We feel
that several of the younger play-
ers will come on and make a sub-
stantial contribution."

Veteran defenders Brian
Casey and Jim Steele have pro-
vided a solid wall of protection
for goalkeeper Dave Torrence.
who has registered two consecu-
tive shutouts.

“Every time out they [Casey
and Steele] have played strong
games." Bemis said, “and Dave
made a couple good. acrobatic
saves and broke up a breakaway
last game.“

Offensively. junior Sparky

J Lucke has been the team's clutch

/ii.

performer. It was Lucke that
scored the game's only goal in the
Panthers‘ win over Grove City
last Friday. He has scored goals
in both of the last two games.

Now that the Panthers are on a
winning streak. Bemis believes
that this can only help the team‘s
morale. especially for the
younger players.

“Winning helps keep confi-
dence up," he said. “The fellas
feel good and have been playing
well.“

Pitt is on the offensive for the
first time this season. With two
straight wins. the outlook is get-
ting brighter with each day. Con-
tinued steady performances from
the upperclassmen and improve-
ment from the freshmen spells
trouble for West Penn Confer-

“‘-I\r\ Inc.-

to fare well against Metro Confer-
ence rival Florida State.

“We look at this as a prime week-
end," Luster said, adjusting the
weight of the monkey on his back.
“Florida State and us are both in the
same conference, so we're looking
forward to play them because we see
them in two more weeks. This will
give us a good look at them.

“In fact, the four teams are all
close. Everyone has pretty solid
teams. I think every match will....l
would be surprised if one team beat
anybody else in three (games). There
will be a lot of five-game matches."

If the Cardinals do not find them-
selves in some of those hypothetical
matches. it will be open season in
game hunting.

PENN STATE

Coach Russ Rose sounds like he
just lost his beachside home to a

_ Malibu Beach typhoon. He‘s under-

going a complex state of stress. Not
even_ the Sony, it seems. was
salvageable.

The Lady Lions are coming off a
weekend tournament which saw
them oppose Toledo in one ofthose
matches. l.ate in that match, 5-ll
middle blocker Patty Skadeland
went up for a returnand came down
breaking her right leg. She‘s lost for
the season, and Rose is lost in
distress

ti:wuwwwwrttttttiiiiiiiﬁiiiiiititiitiiﬁiitiiiiiftiiiiiiiiiiﬁi

“It's hard to say what to expect
this weekend," Rose said. “Right
now I'm more concerned with our
program. The Pitt tournament is
just the next stop on our schedule."

Rose deems his two-year starter
no less important than whiskey for
your average alcoholic.

“We are practicing the whole team
with l0 players and one player is
playing a specific position. Now that
player is gone. We must reevaluate.
When you take that player away, it
reduces practice time to something
else," Rose said.

“I have no idea what we're going
to do. It would be like Ulana[Kohu-
tiak, Pitt's middle hitter] breaking
her leg and not playing.”

That's called thinking with a clear
head. Featured this weekend will be
the East’s top two hitters. Kohutiak,
coming off a year during which she
was named first team Big East, will
be rivaled by another rose, PSU
senior Laurie Barberich.

The Lady Lions‘ fifth-year coach
is ofa different opinion. “There's no
more a rivalry than being displayed
in football and basketball,“ Rose
said. “Our biggest match on our
schedule is not Pitt.jlist as l‘m sure
Penn State is not that important on
their schedule.“
