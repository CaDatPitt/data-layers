Benes’ Brother

To Talk Today
At Pitt Forum

Czech Senator to Tell
About Federalization

Sen.ator Votja Benes, ‘Czechoslova-
kian statesman and brother of Dr.
Eduard Benes, former president of
Czechoslovakia, will speak this aft-
ernoon before Pitt Town meeting at
2:30 o’clock in 244 Cathedral. His
speech, “Federalization of Central
Europe,” will be centered around
a plan for a union of European na-
tions in the event of a British vic-
tory of the war.

Known throughout Europe as one
of the continent’s foremost educa-
tors, Senator Benes was for a time
inspector general of the public
schools of Prague. In 1913 he made
a detailed study of the school sys-

tem of the United States, and fol-
lowing the World war, devoted him-
self to the development of Czechos-
lovakia’s educational program.

Ten Year Man

Active also in the political affairs
of his country, Senator Benes, as
early  1915, took up the cause of
an independent Czechoslovakia. In
1924 he was elected to the National
assembly and was a member for ten
years, after which he became a sen-
ator. As a member of the legisla-
tive body, much of his work was
aimed at the extension of educa-
tional facilities in Czechoslovakia.

During the Munich conference in
1938, Senator Benes was traveling
in the United States, and immedi-
ately following the historic meeting
he spoke throughout America in
protest against the partition of
Czechoslovakia. He returned, but
left secretly in J un-e, 1939, after the
ﬁnal Nazi entry in March.

Second War Speech

This is the second time that Sena-
tor Benes has spoken to citizens of
the United States while the exist-
ence of his country hinged on the
outcome of a major war. During
the ﬁrst World war he traveled here,
organizing his fellow-countrymen
to aid in the struggle for independ-
ence from Austria-Hungary.

Benes will also speak in “Interna-
tional. Relations” in the fourth hour
class of Dr. Benjamin H. Williams,
professor f political science.

Following today’s ‘Town meeting,
series of discussions on labor, edu-
been
planned, according to Esther Mar-
cuson, C41, chairman.

At one of the meetings in the
near future, Miss Marcuson reveal-
ed, a group of faculty members will
hold a panel ‘discussion similar in
form to the one ‘which met with
success earlier in the season.

Fill Remaining Posts

At the largest organization meet-
ing of non-fraternity students ever
held at the University, the Inde-
pendant association, newly formed
socio-educational group, elected
Fred Robie, C41, president on Fri-
day afternoon.

Also elected to positions in the
organization were three juniors in
the college, Hiram Milton, vice pres-
ident; Jack Brady, secre-tary; and
Ed Tait, treasurer. In addition to
the above, the four men will serve
on the .association’s executive com-
mittee.

Following the election, Robie out-
lined the purpose of the organiza-
tion, saying, “we want to give to
each and every non-fraternity man
and woman on this campus an or-
ganization with prestige, an active
and functioning organization, to
which they can belong, and one in
which they can be proud of their
membership.

“Not only do we want students to
join our organization, but we- also
want them to take an active part in
its progress by joining and working
on committees, such as the social,
educational, and membership
groups,” he added.

Other business discussed at the
meeting centered about University
recognition of the association, de-
layed because the SFA executive
committee demanded that Robie
produce a copy of the constitution
before it would place its oliicial
stamp of approval on the organi-
zation.

A constitution was ratiﬁed at the
meeting.

Applies for Admission to Pitt

On a dreary morning in the early
months of 1936, a handsome young
Italian solemnly donned a ﬂier’s
uniform.

Together with thousands of fel-
low—so1diers, he was transported. to
Majorca, a tiny island off the coast
of Spain.

For 23 months, he and his youth-
ful countrymen regularly and often
reluctantly, _ brought the Spanish
citizens their morning coffee—-—in the
form of bombs.

Today that young man, Robert
Federici, is in the United States
seeking admission to the University.

And again he may be drafted-»

this time for service in the Ameri-
can army.

For Robert is an American citizen
by virtue of _his birth here, 24 years
ago. He went_to Italy with his par-
ents when he was sixyears old and
stayed there until the spring of
1940, when his much-coveted pass-
port to America came through.

He arrived here a short time
before R—day and perhaps he will
ﬁnd that he has walked from one
armed conﬂict into another.

The dark-haired pilot wears a
tiny pair of blue and silver wings
on his lapel—the emblem of the Ital-
ian air forces. And he expressed the
wish that if he is drafted for duty
here, he might receive an appoint-
ment to the ﬂying cadets.

“I would like to teach a language‘

—Spanish, French, Italian per-

haps,” he explained. Robert grad-
uated from the University Piero del
Piano, where he received his teach-
ing degree. He has applied for ad-
mission to the graduate school.

When asked whether he would
like to return to Italy to teach, his
reply was emphatically “No!”

“I think I will like America bet-
ter,” he replied.

Robert has two brothers now serv-
ing in the Italian army. His father
is a hotel owner in Aguila, Italy.

The former bomber-aviator feels —

that Italy’s recent defeats in World
War II are due, in part, to a lack
of necessary supplies.

“You know, you can have air-
planes, but you must have gasoline
and oil, too, no?” he commented.

But his attitude seemed to in-
dicate thatrthe Italians do not have
their heart in the ﬁght. “They are
not a war-like people,” he declared.

Regarding employment in Italy,
he explained that there are a start-
ling number of jobless youths in
ling number of jobless youths and
that the government has not as yet
solved its poverty question.

Robert missed being drafted for
service in the Italian army again in
the present war, because his pass-
port to America arrived just before
Italy adopted her armament pro-
gram.

At the present time, he is staying
with relatives in Uniontown, Pa.

American Universities

Aid Foreign Students

 Youth Group Will Try to Preserve

Culture in Europe’s Prison Camps

Students in foreign countries whose educational activities have been

interrupted by conditions of war, will be beneﬁted by donations of

studentsin American universities through the medium of the World Stu-

dent Service fund. .

This fund, of which Dr. Homer
P. Rainey, former chairman of the
American Youth" commission and
now president of Texas university,
isi:,national chairman, has been in-
strumental in continuing education
within the concentration and prison
camps and providing recreational
facilities which otherwise would be
impossible.

Hoping to salvage the student
leadership of this generation in the
Far East and Europe, the forerun-
ners of WSSF, the European Stu-
dent Relief fund and the Far East-
ern Student Service fund, have been
active during the past few years to
obtain contributions to provide ed-
ucation needs and maintain and de-
velop the present feeling of good-
will which now exists between stu-
dents. in America and the foreign
countries.

Hulda Tully, C41, chairman of
the University campaign, announces
that students will be solicited for
funds beginning the week of Feb-
ruary 24 and that the goal is $2,000.

Chairman of the city-wide cam-
paign which will be conducted on
the campuses of Pitt, Tech, and
PCW is Paul Spray, C41. A mini-
mum of $5,000 is expected from the
combined efforts.

Money contributed by students
may be earmarked for either the
Chinese or European students and,
if not designated for either group,
will be distributed in such a man-

her that not less than 50 per cent

“Y-ivill be sent to China.

An interest in the music accepted
for the Cap and Gown production
of 1941 has been exhibited by
Broadcast Music, Incorporated, ac-
cording to a statement from Theo-
dore W. Biddle, graduate manager

of the Cap and Gown show, who I

has contacted the BMI office in New
York.

BMI has asked that copies of the
music to be used in’ this year’s pro-
duction be submitted ‘to them so

that they might appraise them for
publication.‘ Although

tunes in former years, the present
radio situation prompted Biddle to
investigate other publishing possi-
bilities for Cap and Gown tunes.
On campus, registration of stu-
dents interested in taking part in
this year’s production will be con-

, tinned from 1 to 4 o’clock today in

828 Cathedral. Approximtely 90 of

the required 200 applicants needed -

had ﬁlled out the triplicated appli-
cation blanks by the 4 o’clock dead-

. line on Friday.

A schedule of special dance
training sessions which will be held
for the beneﬁt of new candidates

. was given to everyone who applied.

Tuesday, February 18, from 3:30 to
5 o’clock; Wednesday, February 19,

- from 7 to 9 o’clock; and Thursday,
. February 20, from 3:30 to 5 o’clock

were the times set for the special
sessions. Members of former Cap
and Gown productions should not
attend these sessions.

Tryouts will begin on February
24, when Edward A. Morgan, the
new director of the show arrives in
Pittsburgh.

Why go fraternity? Who is the

answer to these questions, in fact
all the answers, can be found in
the Panther’ Sez who? Sez Jack
Stauff, Editor.

The February issue, the largest

Style Show is

Fashion Drama

Students May Select
Models By Ballots .

The Americana Futurama Fash-
ions Drama is all that the name im-
plies in twenty-ﬁve fashionable acts.
At present, in the throes of produc-
tion,Fth_,e, dram§t__bears a striking re-.
semblance to a style show-—in fact
it is a style show. But it only re-
sembles vaguely the obsolete style
shows of 1940.

Select Your Models

Sponsored by the Pitt News, it
will be produced by its co-authors,
Cortland Bacall, BA41, business
manager of the News, and Gene
Pyle, C41, and will have its pre-
miere in the Hotel Schenley on
March 3. s

The plot of the piece will be that
of a style show. But the drama
will not be a panorama of Fashions
Americana; rather it will portray
what the better dressed men and
women. students will wear in the
near future.

The characters will be models,
men and women of the University
who will be selected by student bal-
lots. Ballots will appear on page 4
of the Pitt News. After they have
been ﬁlled out with the name of the
student’s favorite model, they
should be dropped in the ballot
boxes on the ground floor by 4
o’clock today.

Americans Best Dressed

“See America First,” the authors
argue, as the fashions of Paris are
no more and one must look to
America for fashions of the future.
Although‘ the show will n.ot be
feverishly patriotic, the whole
theme is based on that fact that
American students are and will

continue to be the best dressed in

the world, according to Bacall.

There will be music and dancing
following the show with the music
furnished by Rusty Williams and
his orchestra. P. S.—There will be
no charge.

Picture Fans to See Selves
As Others Have Seen Them

.By ANITA PAT BARONE

A display of “Pictures of People
Looking at Pictures,” will begin in
the ﬁne arts gallery.on the seventh
ﬂoor .today and extend , through
March 15.

The exhibit includes everything
from a Peter Brueghel facsimile
drawing to cartoons from the New
Yorker on this particular subject.
It is made up of prints, drawings,
and paintings in which the visitor
to the art gallery and the collector
in his study form the theme.

Most of the works shown are
from the nineteenth and the twenti-
eth centuries. These are supple-
mented by photographic reproduc-
tions tracing the history of the sub-
ject back to the sixteenth century.

However, it has been mostly in
modern times that the artist has
used this subject forvsatire.

The exhibition not only pokes fun
at the seriousness with which art
lovers sometimes take themselves,
but also portrays actual galleries

and the gaping spectators in them.

In pictures such as are in the ex-
hibit, theiartist gives evidence that
he is conscious of his form of ex-
pression by showing that he is
aware of his patron and his place
in the social order.

In other words the artist is mere-
ly analyzing the effect of his work
or art in general upon society,
sometimes just for fun, sometimes
with serious, intent and in an ana-
lytical mood, and sometimes along
satirical lines.

Perhaps the most outstanding
work in the entire exhibit is the
Degas original called “Mary Cassatt
at the Louvre.” Mary Cassatt has
a special interest for Pittsburghers
since she was born here. She was
a great friend and admirer of Degas,
and lived and studied in France the
greater part of her life.

Some of the other artists included
are: Daurnier, Gropper, Peggy
Bacon, John Sloan, Adolph Dehn,
and Peter Arno.

Yarnell Speaks j
To Engineers

In Foster Hall  

Rear Admiral Harry E. Yarnell,
former commander of the -United

States Asiatic ﬂeet, will speak at a
special assembly for junior and sen-
iors in the Schools’ of Engineering
and Mines on Thursday at 2:30
o’clock in Foster Memorial. He
will discuss opportunities in the
U. S. Navy for engineering grad-
uates.

Admiral Yarnell will be accompa-
nied by Commander J . R. Lannom
and four other naval officers who
will also speak at the special meet-
mg.

Following the general meeting,
the naval officers will have personal
interviews with seniors. Howard E.
Dyche, professor and head of the
department of mechanical engineer-
ing, is chairman of the assembly.

Admiral Yarnell, who retired as
commander of the Asiastic fleet in
November, 1939, has been speaking
before college engineering bodies,
advising students on naval engi-
neering opportunities. He was re-
called in Washington January 1 for
this special duty.

Promoted through grades from
an ensign in 1899 to rear admiral in
1928, Admiral Yarnell was appoint-
ed chief of the bureau of engineer-
ing, Navy department in Septem-
ber ‘1928. From 1931 to 1933 he was
commander of the aircraft squad-
rons of the battle ﬂeet; from 1933
to 1936 he was commandant of the
Pearl harbor naval station; and in
1936 became commander-in-chief of
the Asiatic ﬂeet.

During the World war, Admiral
Yarnell served as commanding of-
ﬂcer of the U. S. -S. Nashville which
was on patrol duty in the Gibraltar
region. He served in the Spanish-
American war, in the Philippine
Insurrection and Boxer campaign,
and took part in the occupation of
Vera Cruz in 1914.

SOUNDING OFF FOR ROY HOWARD in a
cciast-’to--coast string of papers, pounding out
diatribe-s vvhi-ch daily defy everybody and every-
thing from French politics to American movies,
is former sports reporter Westbrook Sourstom-
ach Pegler, whose column carries the ironic title,
“Fair Enough.”

Local outlet for Pegler’s spouting is the How-
ard—controlled Press, managed by Edward Leech.
Though the column is scheduled as a daily fea-
ture, there have been numerous cases when the
Press has failed to run it, excusing itself with a
note that it had not been received that day.

Last Monday, however, “Fair Enough” was
omitted without any e:~:plan.ation. Again on
Tuesday it did not run, but this time the Press
ran a box which said Pegler had been omitted
because his column had. been “deemed unde-
sirable.”

Because we, personally, were curious as to
what Peg had said, and because we thought
many of our readers would be interested, we
went over to Carnegie 1ibrary’s periodical room,
took a look at the out—of-town Howard papers,
and learned an amazing number of gory de-
tails.

NEW YORK-—Feb. 10-After years of masquer-
ading as a rather naive but always well-meaning
amateur fuss-budget, Mrs. Eleanor Roosevelt lately
has been revealing herself as a cunning and inde-
fatigable conspirator against the rights and independ-

' once of the individual American citizen and an active
proponent of power-government . .

. Her objective is collectivism and, ultimately,
some scheme containing the most bending elements
of Communism and I-Iitlerism.

Tuesday’s gem opened like this:

NEW YORK, Feb. 11-—-In the writing of Felix
Frankfurter, the Supreme Court last week issued to
labor unions a special license to commit crimes against
individuals and thus against the community . . A

This deci.&_iio.n is consistent with the New Deal
policy which itself was derived from Justice Frank-

furter, through his contamination of mischievous cub
lawyers, who, in turn, have polluted the thought of
the government on the subject of the rights of in-
dustry and of th.e individual citizen.

Well, there you are. Join the guessing game
as to why Leech cut W.P. Leading ‘arguments
say he did it because:

(I) Leech cannot afford to have the name
of another Press columnist (E. Roosevelt’s “My
Day”'is a Press feature) kicked around to this

, extent; or,

(2) Pittsburgh is a union center. The

Press has to play ball with organized labor.

Brave New World

Brave new world!

The surface of the earth controlled bya lever,

Man, the animal, toothless, bald, and slender
Walking the surface ofthe earth masticating tender
Herbs, discussing his digestion in scientiﬁc jargon:
“Last night . . a drop too much of lactose .

under the
Moocra—micra-marcra-scope.”

Brave new world!

A Therershall be a purely scientiﬁc singing,
A mathematically perfect, precise ringing
Of the decadent bell on the steepe peeling
Ideologically. You know me Joe, I grew up
In America from a Chinese embryo, was fed
On compounds, swathed in Borax.

Brave new world!
I sing of the hygienically heated in an enameled pot,
I sing of sociology and its redundant symbols,

» Of psychology, sweet aloes for the third—rate mind;
I weep for the horse that drew the lordly chariot,
I weep for the Irish swastika, once burning in the

night,

Now branded on a million hearts.

VOTJA BENES, brother of Eduard———former
president of the independent nation of Czecho-
slovakia, speaks today on “Federalization of

Central Europe.”

At Town Meeting we students will again get
the chance to hear and the chance to question
a representative of what was once the “most

democratic state in Europe.”

For Eduard Benes has spoken at the Univer-
sity; the sister of Thomas Masaryk, first presi-
dent of Czechoslovakia, has been honored here;
Jan Papanek, high in the councils of the exiled
Czech government, spoke in Heinz Memorial a
year or two ago; and the gay Czechoslovakian
room with its glass enclosed letter from great
Thomas Masaryk, will remain to speak for the
Czechoslovak nation. when such concepts as

7

“nations’ are ancient history.

We don’t have any idea what Votja Benes
will say when he speaks on federalization of
central Europe, whether he will oppose it in
part or in whole, whether he will favor it in

part or in whole.

But we do know that in the interests of a
Europe,
statesmen, as Votja Benes was and is now, can
exert a powerful and important democratic in-
ﬂuence on the cyclone area that is now Europe

united and peaceful

in Chaos.

We wish good luck to citizen Bones of the
democratic worl.d, and we extend to him a wel-
come to the city of Pittsburgh, the birthplace,
in a sense, of the Czechoslovak nation.

Well, he’s doing it again! The

Artie will keep only the men com-

That will leave only Nick Fatool on

De Naut on bass for Shaw’s opening ,

A new outﬁt will be built around

And wasn’t it just a short while
ago that Shaw started his present
group with strings because he felt
he was at last able to create and
maintain the kind of orchestra he
wanted? Remember that he had
tried it once before when he was

ﬁrst starting only to see it fail ﬁ-

This reminds us of an occurence
which took place backstage at the-
Stanley when Shaw was last here.
(Don’t let this get around, under-

Anyway, several of the men in the

He looked at it, remarked sarcas-

never work in South America be-
cause it is hot down there and heat

You can memorize the cabinet po-
sitions by taking St. Wapniacl and

New York holds the second most im-

worms are hermaphroditic
. . some people live fast, reaching
puberty and passing into senility
by the time they are ﬁve years old.

It doesn’t matter whether Shake-

in which one need know nothing of
the author’s personal life in order
to understand his writing . . the

Pitt Set to Pad Record,
Keep Carnegiés Clean

Panther Stretch Drive Promises
Greatest Season in Recent Years

Having hurdlod some of the best teams in the basketball world
in their drive toward the greatest‘ season in years, Pitt’s Panthers
are set to step over the near-prostrate Carnegie Tartans and chalk
up their clevc-nth victory of the campaign tomorrow i1’igl1t on the

Stadium court.

Since their 45-30 Win over Tech ﬁve weeks ago, the Panthers
have come out on top in ﬁve of their last six games. Right now
Carl.son’s boys are in their hottest streak of the year, while Car-
:neg'ie Tech ’s record stands at 13 defeats and no victories.

iﬂoieser Seeks
Grid Reserves

Freshmen, Jayvees
Get Chance in Spring

Promising freshman football can-
didates will be in demand when
coach Charlie Bowser opens the
annual spring drills.

With the stiffest football sched-
ule ever devised by the Pitt athletic
department coming up this fall, the
‘need for reserves becomes apparent.

The 1940 varsity team’s record
was marred by this weakness, for
several losses might have been
turned into wins if the reserves had
been equal to the ﬁrst combination.
_ The remedy must rest with the
freshman gridsters and outstanding
players from the jayvee squad.

Freshman competition is limited
to inter-squad games and coaches
Klein and Kliskey had a tough time
‘of it the past fall.

“Rabbit” Ripple, speedy half-
back, ‘might be one of the standout
‘players on the Pitt varsity except
for his scant 135 pounds. However,
he may overcome the handicap.

On the line, Joe Broudy and J ack '

Durishan are prominent candidates
for regular jobs._ Both played bril-
liantly all year and proved to be
rugged defense men.

Jim Clawes should be another of
the freshman to show promise in
spring ‘trials. ’Clawes played a
strong game at the center post last
‘fall, and will ,undoubtedly give
Stevesinco and Poke Allshouse a
run for the pivot job.

From the jayvee squad, Bob Mal-
loy, triple threat halfback, rates
varsity consideration.

can Will Address
;P,1._tt Metallurgists

Fifthspeaker before the national
defense‘ course in metallurgical in-
spection, James P. Gill will give a
lecture ‘ on “Inspection of Tool

~Stee1s” ‘today and tomorrow, be-

fforethe 200 metallurgists and rep-
resentatives of local industry en-

rolled in the course. I

. The ‘speaker, chief ‘metallurgist
of the Vanadium-Alloys Steel com-
pany, Latrobe, is retiring president
of the American Society of Metals.
A graduate of the Missouri School
of Mines where he earned the bach-
elor of science in metallurgy and
the master of science degrees, Mr.
Gill also studied at Columbia uni-
versity. He joined the Vanadium-
All.oys Steel company in 1920; was
chairman of the Pittsburgh section
of the American Society of Metals,
1926-1927; won the silver medal of
the American Society for Steel
Treatment in 1922; and is the au-
thor of “Tool Steels,” a leading book
in his ﬁeld.

But anything, including the im-
possible, can happen in basketball.
Tartan basketball teams have been
known to score victories over quin-
tcts which had proved their superi-
ority only a few weeks before. The
Panthers found that out last year.

Big man for -Carnegie at this
stage of the Skibo slide is Randall
“Red” Burch, tough little ﬁghter
who has kept the Tartans in, or
almost in, their last few games.
Dave Brinn, Wally Patton, Herb
Niederberger, and Henry Holets are
other probable starters for Tech.

On the March

Against the Tartans’ wobbly first
team and near-invisible reserve
strength, Pitt’s 16-man squad should
get at least some valuable experi-
ence, at most a brisk workout.

Phenomenal shooting and con-
sistently improving ﬂoor work have
carried the Panthers near the top
rung of the district basketball climb.
After getting rid of some pretty
sloppy work in the first Tartan tus-
sle and some ludicrously bad shoot-
ing against Waynesburg, the Pitt
club has rolled u.p impressive vic-
tories in its last four starts.

Last Thursday the Panthers were
at the peak of their game, swamp-
ing Geneva, two-time conqueror of
Carnegie, 50-36. Meanwhile Tech
was blowing a 19-point half-time
lead to drop a 40-96 decision to
Villanova and stretch its streak to
twelve straight  . down.

Kocheran Gets Hot

Pitt’s win over Geneva was a
clean cut victory in which the Jun-
gle Cats outscored the Covenanters
in every quarter. George Kocheran
continued his scoring streak to ring
up 10 points, while Mel Port topped
that total by the margin of two foul
tosses.

Doc Carlson used his full travel-
ing squad of 11 against .coach
Smiley Weltner’s passers. The fast-
moving Panthers; rolled at top speed
all the way to ﬁre in 22 ﬁeld goals
against 14 for the Covenanters, fair
warning that Pitt’s ice-cream eaters,
having reversed the victory-hungry
records of the past three years, will
be tough to stop from here on in.

Fresh Cage Coach
Waite Sees Varsity
Prospects on Team

All attempts at forming a fresh-
man basketball league having failed,
first year men are plying their trade
now only in afternoon practice and
scrimmage games.

The next scheduled scrimmage
is for tomorrow night on the sta-
dium floor at 7 o’clock.

Practices to date have led coach
Howard Waite to believe there are
at least five varsity prospects on
the squad. Lloyd Carlson looks like
a sure bet.

Steve Shuber, Art LaMonico,
Steve Zernick, and Walt Eneschen-
ko, if he settles down, also are
making good bids for varsity berths
next year.

Also running a close race for hon-

ors among the yearlings are Harry
Matthews, Walt Jones, Ed Cowden,
Frank Dax, Paul Good (the last
two were high scorers in the last
scrimmage), and Bob Aiken, despite
his physical handicap.

Athletic Department Packs Up,

Moves into New Headquarters

“Where do I go from here,” or
“Jimmy Hagan rides again,” is the
latest cry to come from the Univer-
sity’s athletic oﬁices.

Last Friday the athletic depart-
ment omoved desks, typewriters,
plays, schedules, and other-fund-a-
mental needs of a sports department
to the old Oil & Gas building.

Starting way back in 1928 when ~

the athletic staff worked in the sta-
dium at gate three, they have
moved ﬁve times. This probably
sets the modern record for moving
in the University of Pittsburgh.

In 1935, the YMCA hut was the
new uoﬂice for sports in Pitt. This
office was kept three years by some
uncanny manipulation, but then the
boys moved back to gate one in
the stadium.

In case you’ve been at Pitt for
the past few years and haven’t no-

The professionals have one, the
amateurs have one, and the colleg-

O Gotl1a.m’s Tourney’ Newest

Newest of the big-time basketball
tournaments is New York’s Nation-
al Invitational tournament, now
preparing for its third year. The
Metropolitan Intercollegiate com-
mittee invites a few teams from
the provinces, matches them against

the local hotshots, and then steps,

nimbly out of theway while New
York’s sports writers, original spon-

sors of the tourney, pick anall-star E

team. This all-star team is re-
markable for the fact that those
who give honors to the stars have
actually seen .them play.

The New York tourney showed

six of the top teams‘ of the nation
last year, though Stanford and Cal-
ifornia might legitimately "have
howled if the big city writers had
boosted the winner of their pet
show as national champions. Spread
out over three_nights of competition
to allow -a. rest to the ...players and
none to the customers’ pocketbooks,
the New York basketbowl is notable

because: the caliber of play is high ~.

(three of last year’s entrants, Du-
quesne, Colorado, and Oklahoma
Aggies, had a combined record of 57
wins against four losses); its win-
ner is not labeled “World’s Cham-
pion”, its all-star team makes sense.

Denver, Colorado’s older and big-
ger (eight teams in the ﬁnals, sev-
eral more in regional play ffs), Na-
tional Collegiate athletic associa-
tion tournament also sported big
teams and gate receipts last year.

Pitt’s all-time all-American Char- _ —

ley Hyatt has been a ﬁxture ”at'Na-

tional Amateur athletic‘ association ‘

tourneys, where squads led by him
have carried off top honors several
times. The playoff series is a com-
prehensive affair generally getting

because a six-team elimination is
mathematically more likely to in-
clude all worthy challengers than a
two-team “championship” game.

is such a screwy game that schools
with enrollments of 200 regularly

country will have a chance to make
itself a basketball immortal. ‘Comes

In China the funds are handled

Thus far, 8,500 students have re-

ROTC Seniors Must

Serve Year in Army

Sixty-eight University ROTC
seniors are aﬁected by the new rul-
ing of the U. S. War department
which requires them to go into
active service in the U. S. Army
immediately upon receiving com-
missions, according to Colonel
Ralph W. Wilson, professor of mil-
itary science and tactics. Most of
the seniors will be commissioned as
second lieutenants in the U. S.
Army reserve, Coast Artillery
corps, when they are graduated in
June.

The new order of the War depart-
ment, made public late last week,
requires that seniors in the Ad-
vanced course of the Reserve Offi-
cers Training corps, in order to get
their commissions, must sign a
written agreement to serve a year
of active duty in the Army. Newly-
commissioned oﬂicers will be sub-
ject to immediate call upon gradu-
ation and completion of the four
years ROTC course.

The ROTC graduates will serve
as oﬁicers with regular pay at
Army posts within the United States
and in the Phillipines, Hawaii,
Alaska, Puerto Rico, and the Canal
Zone. Seniors are offered their
own choices of posts in the posses-
sions if they do not prefer service
within the continental limits of the
United States.

Before the War department’s new

Plane Dleiii

 

>X<

ruling, ROTC graduates were com-

missioned as officers in the Army
reserve, and, except for two weeks
active duty every three years, re-
tained their status as reserve oﬁ"i-
cers without having to go into
regular service. If a reserve offi-
cer failed to serve his two weeks’
active duty before an elapse of ﬁve
years, his commission was auto-
matically removed. Ordinarily, the
reserve officer could retain his com-
mission and also gain a promotion
to ﬁrst lieutenant if he served only
two weeks’ active duty and took in-
struction and correspondence work
for three years, Colonel Wilson ex-
plained.

Now, to be assured commissions,
ROTC seniors must agree to active
service for a year as ofﬁcers in the
Army, subject to call immediately
upon graduation in June. Failure
to do this, or fulﬁll the require-

ments of the full ROTC course,- ~-

makes the student subject to the

regular draft as ' an ordinary
civilian. . . . . . .
Students in the Medical Corps

will obtain defermentsof oneyear"

in order to complete their intern-
ships.

Pitt ROTC students are in the
Coast Artillery corps, but can serve
anywhere in the United States or
its possessions because coast artil-
lery units are maintained in all
territories.

War Department Offers Seven
Month Flyers’ Training Course

Not wishing to have a great num-
ber of planes and no one to ﬂy
them, the war department is seek-
ing to expand its ﬂying training
courses by oﬁering to qualiﬁed un-
married men seven months training
as ﬂying cadets.

In their expansion program plans,
2,400 men are needed for enlist-
ment every ﬁve weeks.

To be qualiﬁed for the course
each applicant must meet the fol-
lowing requirements:

1). He must be unmarried, a
United States citizen between the
ages of twenty and twenty-seven,
and must agree to stay in the serv-
ice three years after he has com-
pleted his training.

2). He must pass a physical test
which is more stringent than the
examinations given in any other
ﬁeld.

3). He must pass an educational
examination which is the equiva-
lent to two years of college. Stu-
dents who have completed two
years of college need not take the
test if they can present document-
ary evidence of their status.

4). He must remain unmarried
during his training period and for
a year afterwards. Following his
three years as a ﬂying cadet he must
serve three years on active duty
with the regular army as a reserve
officer only if it is necessary.

During his time as a ﬂying cadet
he is paid a salary of $75 a month.
Board and clothing are provided by
the army.

At the Completion of his time as a
ﬂying cadet he becomes a second-
lieutenant in the . United States
army and receives the pay and al-
lowances given to officers of similar
grade in the regular army.

Large M ap Will Inform Students on Movements
Of Foreign Armies in Africa, Europe, Balkans

Have you ever wondered where
Anastalasia is? Have you ever
wondered why the Italian regime
could not get through the Ther-
mopylae pass? Have you ever won-
dered if there really are such
places as Eritrea, Boetia, or Thes-
saly?

Well, the students of the Univer-
sity need no longer remain in the
dark. A four by six foot pressed
board world map bringing the news
of the day will be hung outside the
Y ofﬁce on the eighth ﬂoor of the
Cathedral.

Joe Williams, C44, Y chairman of
the map committee, says that the
map will be maintained to give
everyone an impartial account of
the news.

Each student will be able to fol-
low the actions of the British in
Africa, the Germans in Europe, and
the Italians in the Balkans.

This map, twice the size of the
original drawn several weeks ago,
will trace names and places that
have heretofore remained synono-
rnous with fairy tales.

Writer Comes to University
As Aide for News Sei-ieve

“I write all the time.”

Her words are a clue to the career of Miss Marie McSwigan, a Pitt

oﬂice.‘
lVfiss' Mcswigan has had two
,books, published. One, “Sky

Hooks,” 1938, is the life of John
‘Kan'e', a "celebrated Pittsburgh artist
who started as a house painter, and
with no art training became well-
known as an American primitive.

Her second book, published last
September, is titled “The Weather
House People.” It is a whimsical
tale for children.

In addition to writing her books,
Miss Mcswigan, a former member
of the editorial staffs of the Pitts-
burgh Press and the Sun—Telegraph,
has also written a number of news-»
paper serials and children’s stories.

Her career took a turn “from the
sublime to the ridiculous” when,
after writing publicity for the high-
brow International Art- Exhibits,
she did publicity work for Kenny-
wood Park for ﬁve years. She en-
joyed her work at the park espec-
ially because of the people with
whom she was associated. “I can’t
speak too highly of them,” said Miss
Mcswigan of the vaudevi1le—type

performers at Kennywood. She
ﬁnds that their hard lives and
“tough breaks” make them real
people.

Miss Mcswigan is an al.1-around
writer. She likes all angles of writ-
ing from serious art biographies to
publicity work for he park.

She majored in English at Pitt,
was college editor of the Owl, and
worked on the Panther and Pitt
News. She did graduate work at
Columbia.

Now Miss Mcswigan is back at
Pitt; as she -commented, “back to the
sublime, you might say.”

Dr. H. J. Rose .

. of the Mellon institute will
speak on “Coal—A Major Field For
Research” in 1009 Cathedral at 8
o’clock Wednesday evening under
the auspices of Sigma Xi, national
honorary science fraternity.

Qwl to Exchange Potato Chips
F or Prompt Yearbook Sales

The Owl is cashing in its chips
on undergraduate subscriptions to-
day at 12:30 o’clock——the chips in
this case being potato slices of the
salty, crunchy variety.

Undergraduate salesmen w ill
cover all entrances to the Cathedral
and the Tuck shops to distribute
the chips, and though they don’t re-
quire that you subscribe to get a
bag, still a subscription would help.
In short, the chips are free and
buying a subscription from the
salesmen with the yellow tags is
only incidental.

“But,” says Hillard Kreimer,
BA42, campaign manager, “if you
realize that the Owl represents a
record for each year of your col-
lege career, which we hope will be
illustrious, and that there will be

 
  
 
 
 
 
  
         
      
       
   

 

only one printing of the book, and
that it is the only college yearbook

to ever have a real wooden cover,
I know you can’t go wrong in sub-
scribing.”

The free potato chips idea is one
of the highlights in the undergrad-
uate sales campaign of the Owl
yearbook. Theme of the book is
that of a scrap—book, in which stu-
dents will ﬁnd pages and pages of
informal candid shots of themselves.
One section of eight pages will be
devoted exclusively to random shots
of undergraduates only.

A sort of graphic memoir of col-
lege days, the Owl emphasizes the
“you” point—of-view, and it sells
for only $3.50, $1.50 of which is
paid when the student subscribes.
