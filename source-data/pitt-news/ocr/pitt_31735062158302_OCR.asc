The AWS Commissionlast week accepted changes in the
By-Laws proposed by Senior Court. Major revisions were in
three areas. All undergraduate women students will formally‘
vote on the revisions at an open election in January.

will also “assume responsibilities in the area of public rela-

tions.” In former years the chief¢ A

$350,000 is allotted for this
purpose.

Endow Professdrships

The other two portions of
the grant make this Univer-
sity certainly among the select
few in the nation. $5,500,000 is to
establish and endow 10 distin-
guished professorships in the hu-
manities, natural sciences, and
social sciences.

Another $6,150,000 is to support
50 pre-doctoral and six to nine
post-doctoral fellowships in these
ﬁelds. 

Six of the professor-ships are
to be in the area of the human-
ities, two in the natural sci-
ences, and two in the social sci-
ences. The salaries to professors

. according to the chancellor, are_
to be “commensurate with or
superior to the best salaries
paid in like fields in‘ any other
American university.”

The chancellor termed the com-
bination of grants for professor-
ships and fellowships “one of the

The number of standing com-

Customs Committees were eli-
minated. According to Jean Lin-
tio, chief justice of Senior Court,
these committees will combine in
name and-duties with the Social

Jean Lintio further comment-
ed, “With these changes we feel
that AWS is keeping as up-to-
date as possible.” "

The chairman of the Women’s
Residence Council will be elected
by all the women living on cam-
pus. The position was formerly an,
appointed office.

“Since Pitt is a growing cam-

governing body. It’s logical that
women living in the dorm and
sorority houses have a voice in
who will lead their government,”
the chief justice said.

At the Commission meeting
AWS voted to honor Mrs.‘Vir-

Force Guards Against Heavy Drifts

Snow Removers

On Call. All Night

The University police and
ground forces are constantly

guarding against excessive
snow drifts on the Pitt cam-
pus,

It is their duty to make sure
the sidewalks are cleared and safe
for students to walk. “It’s a tough
job that requires cautious and ob-
servant men,” said Richard Barn-
hart, landscape architect, who sup-

. g ervises snow‘ removal at Pitt.

There are ten men on the
ground force, three of whom are
gardeners, each responsible for a
speciﬁc area. One is responsible to
the Chancellor; he must keep the
walks open at all times.

All Areas Covered

Another is responsible for all
the graduate schools and the third

for the upper campus around Uni- '

versity drive. The foreman is di-
rectly "responsible for the walks
around the Cathedral of Learning.
Most of the entrances are
shoveled by hand. A tractor
with a ﬁber brush ﬁve feet wide
clears the heavier snow drift
up to two inches in depth.
Two gardeners are also assign-
ed tothe wh-ole block of Clapp
Hall. They must keep this area
free from ice and snow at all
times.
Snow Removed Rapidly
In case of a snow fall of more
than ﬁve feet, “We do not have
the equipment to cope with it, but
I don’t think the city does either,”
said Barnhard.
“VVe can only be ‘as careful
as possible in seeingethat the
snow is removed as soon at it‘
falls, thus, preventing thick de-
posits from accumulating!"
During the night one policeman
is on watch around the Cathedral.

Besides this morning beat, cam-

conditions are getting dangerous,
they call the operator at the School

the conditions to her.

She is authorized to call a list
of men who are on call at all

.. Student Makes Criticism,
Of 'Pre-‘registration

“takes precedence over all other
activities, including classes.” For
the tremendous value of pre-
registration, I must cut.a.. class,
which to me is very‘ important. I
‘ ﬁnd that this class that I have at
2:00 is thelast onedbefore an1‘m-
portant test. ‘
. Secondly, a person’s adviser is
not chosen, but appointed. My
advisor is from, the English de-
partment. Unfortunately, In y
major is not English, but Pre-
Med Chemistry. She is of little
.help in the_ selecting of my
courses and usually relies on my
judgment for this important task.
It isnecessary for eve1‘yone to
have an adviser, but I feel that
this person should be from the
department of the course which
is my major for me to adequately
set up my college career.
Thirdly, pre-registration -does
not allow for the choosing of
professors. Upon pre-registering
last semester I had hoped to get
a certain history course taught
by a certain professor. He is
considered to be one of the best
qualiﬁed men in the department
and I wanted to take his par-
ticular class. Under the pre-
registration , system, ’ I was not I

These I tried to change and’.

I was told by an assistant Dean
that if I ‘ever tried to change my

If the p1=e-registering system

' had failed for just me, then I

would say it might be worth
while, but I have heard many
other students voice their op-
inion which coincides with mine.
If the administration feels that
pre-registration is a necessity,
.then I suggest that they find a

seems to reflect a typical see-saw
nature of - the kind where the
goods praise the goods while

' skeptics shout and wave their

ﬁngers. . , _
\ It is tragic to think that amidst
the business of a college day so

many would “be in the room,” un- .. _

aware that they are being subtly
eclipsed by the world about
them. They do_n’t seem to realize
that the’University needs a crea-
tive and thinking student body
conscious of their role as uni-
versity students.

Three “awarenesses” below are

‘imperative, I believe, for this

development.

1. Awareness that the academic
is primary: that moral and. spirit-
ual values will normally inte-
grate themselves in anyhealthy
approach. - ' - "

2. Awareness of their obliga-
tion to themselves as part of an
intellectual “_community to ac-,
quire the best education possible.
Recognition can best occur» with-

in a-creative atmosphere.

3. Awareness that individual
initiative is a necessity for the
student to‘be able to hold his
own in this university super-
structure. Intelligent and con-
structive criticism of this “com-
munity” is essential.

I believe that the‘ Student
Government can be_the states-
man in the development and the
Newspaper its orator. _

The University leadership has
decided upon a bold program for

many months of planning by fac-
ulty and administrative members.
' Fulﬁll Three Functions‘
The college is composed of the
Divisions of the Humanities, Nat-

" ural'Sciences, and Social Sciences.

The, chancellor stated atthe meet-
ing yesterday that‘the college rep-
resents a pioneering effort to pro-
vide a framework within which
the disciplines can ‘most effec-
tively fulﬁll their three—fold func-
tion of liberal education for un-
dergraduates, graduate training,
and support of professional school
programming.

-_One of the basic purposes of
the college is “to help each dis-
cipline’ relate itself to the other
disciplines, and, ﬁnally, to re-

professional ﬁelds.” thereby
achieving an “integrated Uni-

“ \versity.”

The College‘ will: put the a'ca-

“to make a greater contribution
to the advancement and dissemi-
nation of knowledge.” .
Teachers, Students Important
A The chancellor reaﬁirmed that
the “success or failure of an edu-
cational ‘institution depends upon
the quality of its teachers and
students,” in expressing_ the
thanks of the University to the
A..W. Mellon Trust. ..
He expressed the view that

although grants for the im-
provement of physical plant are
necessary, «“gifts such as this
one are especially required and
appreciated because ‘they are
investments in human beings.”
Paul: Mellon, chairman of the
Educational and Charitable Trust,
wrote the Chancellor in relation
to the grant. He said, in part, “If
‘a great‘ city needs a great Uni-
versity, it is, first of all, important
to rememberithat the measure of
a University is its ability to pro-

duce truly educated men and
women’.’_’
“The touchstone,” Mellon

wrote, “is in ‘the quality of the
basic liberal arts.” The Trust
Chairman recognized the need
for additional gifts and new in-
come to the University besides
this grant for undergraduate
scholarships and for new Uni-
versity income “which will
bring fa-cuity salaries through-
out the College to higher
levels.” "
“Itis hoped that this nucleus of
distinguished scholars and stu-
dents may set a standard and a

goal, and that it may stimulate a.

new understanding of the role of
the University in a great city,”

. Mellon concluded.

B)’ MURRAY CHASS

,“I am the spirit of football past,”_uttered the white-haired, stoop-

A , ed over little man with the gold numerals ‘15’ on his blue sweater.

He was addressing the man sprawled doggedly across the 16 mm
movie camera in the Field House projection room. '

The exhausted man with bléary eyes was J ohnny,Michelosen, the
fellow responsible for guiding Pitt football fortunes. He had just com-
pleted plodding through feet, feet, and even more feet of ﬁlm of the
Pantlfers in action this past year. _ , ‘ ~

“You ~weren’t'around,.during my time as an All-American,” the
ancient gridder continued-, ~“but those were the days when we were

American we lost. only one game. Then under Pop Warner and that
hard-as—nails Scotchman, Jock Sutherland,’ Pitt was really put on
the“football map. ' ‘ K '

‘ “You know. You‘ had a taste of it when you played for Jock
in his last'few years here.‘ You even went to the Rbse Bowl one
year——and won. You were the_ quarterback and you enjoyed the
taste of victory and the glory carried along with it. In those years
no one here had to worry about the alumni and the Big Ten.”

“Wait, don’t go any further. That’s ridiculous,’.’ the man with the
worries and the movies exclaimed. This is 1958, not 1938.”.

Just then another ﬁgure strode into the darkened room. The light
from the camera portrayed his husky ﬁgure on the screen. He was
over six feet tall and weighed more ‘than 200 pounds. He wore .a"59’
on his sweater and had the stature of an All-American.

“I am the spirit of football present,” he declared. “Yes, this is
1958, but what happened? After we beat Notre Dame, everyone said‘
. All the guys thought
we would have it easy against Nebraska, so they went out and had a
good time the entire week before the game. V _

“And no/one even cared, not even the coaches. That is, no one
cared until it was too late. Our chances were just about ruined. '
Then we were given half a chance for the Gator Bowl if we beat *
Penn State. But even that didn’t work. It wasn’t a good time that
hurt us in that game. It was a bunch of injuries. , -

.“'So we ﬁnished out of the running, and everybody complained.

it ‘He had thepplayers,’ the bitter critics said. ‘Get rid of him. He’s not-

a coach if he can’t keep the players up for a team like Nebraska. How
much longer does his contract run? Hamilton’s crazy if‘ he doesn’t
ﬁre him.’ But gee whiz. You were spared. These students didn’t have
enough spirit to hang you in efﬁgy. - i ‘ A ~
/“Funny thing. This season, you gave the guys what they wanted.
No gripes‘ about too much scrimmaging or too much hard work. May-
be the trouble was that not enough guys really wanted to play foot-
ball. They just play because they get a scholarship. But that doesn’t
win games and bowl trips.” 
“Okay, okay, so what can I do?”, the befuddled coach cried. By

‘this time he was no longer tired’ but rather the sweat was creeping

\_ out around his shirt collar. “It was just one of those things that hap-

\ pened to us this year. _That’s all over with. What about next year?”

//

“What aboutnext year?’;, said a new voice. This third _vis-
itor was stranger than the ﬁrst two. He wore no sweater with
numerals. Instead he was attired in an olive four-button suit,
foulard tie and button-down shirt. .

Mike could not make out the ‘stranger’s face because it was cov-
ered by some sort of hood. But‘ he could tell that this new person had
something on his head under the hood, and he could tell that it
wasn’t a football helmet. It appeared to be a‘ mortar board, and he.
could see a Phi Beta Kappa key dangling from the ﬁgure’s tie clip.

The new visitor continued. “I am the spirit of football yet-to-
come. You ask about next year, so I will show you.” The wary Mich-
elosen looked toward the screen. There he sawtthe image of what was
to come.‘ It was 1959 and Pitt was winning game after game.

A His line, especially the ends and tackles, was one of the best
in action. His backs couldn’t be stopped. They were passing and’
running like in the days of Warner and Sutherland. Christmas
came, and he found himself and the team in the Cotton Bowl.
That vision blurred, however, and he could see nothing for a few

minutes. Then another picture appeared. ' .

“This is the real future,” football yet-to-come said. “N 0 big teams,
no bowl games, not’ much of anything. Look at the campus: trimesters,
libraries, professional schools, medical center. But no major ~football
opponents. New physical‘ education facilities and bigger intra-mural

‘programs, but no football teams that can compare even to 1958.”.

The vision grew worse. Michelosen no longer saw himself in the
picture. All he could detect were students, happy students, on their
way to their next lectures. .

_‘ As the screen once again became blank and the last guest =ha
departed, Michelosen rose weakly, shufﬂed out thedoor, and went on
his way to see that kid at Falk High who was a straight‘—“A” _student

But as pointed out by Peterson,
“A freshman is not expected to

Says Complacency  
  Not Likely on Varsity Squad 1
    Panthers to Face Wfestminster B
 Tomorrow, Miami Saturday‘

By LARRY HAGGERTY

Will complacency set in on the Panther basketball team
now that they have trounced their arch rival from the Bluff,
Duquesne, to regain their Steel Bowl championship?

“I don’t think so,” declared Jungle Cat Coach Bob Tim-
mons. “It's just possible that the boys have arrived as a team.

Their ﬁrst half showing against Duquesne was darn near
perfect, and ‘£11 1 had to tell them: ~ . '

    

 

at halftime was to keep up the

_ good work.”

.‘‘.They seemed to_ have every-

-- thing under control throughout

the game and it'was ‘a team per-
formance instead of passing the
ball to Donnie" (Hennon) and
hoping that he“ could make the
hoop and hold‘ us in the game,”
continued the Panther tutor. ‘
' Titans Troublesome

.If. the Jungle Cats have suc-
cumbed to, all their ‘favorable
press notices, it’ could not have
come at a‘ better time for West_-
minster and. Miami (Ohio). For

- these are the Panthers’ next two

opponents and both_ are met away
from home. Westminster‘ is en-
countered tomorrow evening and
Miami on Saturday night.

Westminster certainly doesn’t
belong ‘among the nation’s
powers but they always seem
to ‘give the Panthers a tough
time of it at New Wilmington.
Last year at the Field House,
the Jungle Cats triumphed,
72-57, but at Westminsterthey
won by only one point, 75»-74,
after leading by 11 points just
momentsbeforie the ﬁnal buzzer
..sounded. '

“The boys should remember
that terrible scare so I~shouldn’t
have to worry about complacency
tomorrow night,” Timmon said
“Hennon is really looking forward
to the game, _too.”

.Hennon Likes New Wilmington
..“Last season Hennon_,was the
main reason why We lwere able
to beat the Titans twice. New
Wilmington is not too far from
Don’s hometown, Wampum, and
all the folks in that area look
forward to seeing him play. It
also seems to bring out the -best
in‘ him when he plays there,”
added the Panther coach. . _
The Titans» of Coach Buzz
Ridl have a 3-1 record to date
and, will" present’ nearly the
‘same team that ‘appeared
against the Blue and Gold last
season. Leading the team is
Captain_ Dave Rankin. The sen-
ior from McKeesport is a proﬁ-
cient scorer and top rebounder;
Joining Rankin in the starting
lineup are Ron Minnie, Jack
Steele, John Walker, and Chuck
Davis. It will be Davis’ duty to

After the skirmish with West-
minster, the local hoopsters will

Miami that knocked ‘ the
Panthers out of the NCAA

round game‘. The Redskins were

Most of Miami’s,points are pro-
vided by Brown, Thomas, and
Wingard while the boards are us-
ually manned by _Wingard and
Brown. _

Miami was one of the teams

in the 1957 Steel Bowl at the
Field House. They were picked
by some observers as the team
to beat, but they lost to a “hot”
_Duquesne club in the opening
round. They came back, how-
ever, to beat George “lashing-
ton for third place.

Over the Christmasholidays,
the Blue and Gold will take part
in the Carrousel Tournament at
Charlotte, N. C. Their ﬁrst round
opposition will be provided by
Fordham. In the second round
they will encounter either Clem-
son or George Washington.

George Washington was the
Panthers’ ﬁrst round victim in
year’s Steel Bowl, 68-59.

_ forward, the center is John Frid-

T omorrow, thenM iazmi  

Other teams in the tourney are St.
Francis of Loretto, Bucknell,
South Carolina, and Davidson.
Fordham defeated St. Francis "in
last season’s NIT Tournament.
.Mills Hot Against Dukes‘
Hennon will be part of the
same starting ﬁve that shows
Dave Sawyer and John Mills at

ley, while the other guard will be
Dick Falenski. ‘
Mills, a 6-5 junior from Beaver,
played one ‘of his ﬁnest games
in the Panther: win over Du-
quesne. He held the Duke cen-
ter, Bob “Slobbo” Slobodnik,
to just one ﬁeld goal. He also
grabbed 12 rebounds and scored ‘
ten points. *

For reserves Timmons can call
on Mike Ditka, Francis Kondrad,
Nick Sutyak, and Bill Shay. Shay,
a 5-11 senior from Levittown,
N.Y., played a fine game against
Duquesne. He teamed very well

with Hennon as the backcourt " ‘

man and didan outstanding job
as a playmaker and also made
important plays on defense.

SGA Plans

SeatingPollp

For Games

SGA will conduct a student
opinion poll concerning ad-
mission and seating arrange-
ments for varsity‘ football
games. This idea, presented
in a motion made by John
Strauch, Arts ’60, was passed by
the governing body at its meet-
ing last Monday.

‘After the study is made, a state-
ment of policy concerning this
matter will be presented to the
athletic department.

Strauch pointed out that since
the opinions of the student body
are so important to the success or
failure of the football policy, their
feelings on the subject should be
solicited.

However, Woody Turner, Arts
'61, stated that the proposal
would be “likely- to bring about
action by SGA that is not in the
best interest of the student body.
It will be extremely difficult,”
Turner continued, “to make the
issue clear on the ballot.”

Kent Jarrell, Arts ’60, read to
the group his letter to the editor
of the magazine “Who’s Who in

‘American Colleges and Universi-

ties” and the subsequent answer
he received. .
The correspondence had to do
with the possibility of Pitt’s par-
ticipating in the work of “Who’s
Who” by nominating students for
recognition in the magazine.
Jarrell believes that this will
be an incentive for students to
join and workgwith school ac-'
tivities at Pitt more than they
now do.

Four ﬁeld goals in one game

one before! Bobby Conrad
himself said, ‘‘I never kicked
a field goal in high school or
college. In fact, I never even
tried.” But the amazing Texas
A&M back broke two All Star
records by booting four three
pointers, including one for 44

stars upset the Detroit Lions,
