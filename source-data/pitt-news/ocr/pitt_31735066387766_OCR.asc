Words aren’t enough for the
men and women on the front
lines of the USA’s drug war.

As President Bush outlined his
anti—drug plan Tuesday, the grim

Sillaily battle to reclaim the USA’s

streets and souls continued
unabated, as it has through
decades of politicians’ promises:

.oIn the basement of
Interventions, a Chicago treatment
center, addicts gathered in front
of a color TV.

 Arms folded across their chests,
 ihey blurted, “All right” and
 Good” as Bush spoke.

-In New Orleans’ Charity
Hospital, a radio played country
music and a police radio blared
as eight doctors and three nurses
waited for the next grisly case.

Nurse Jean Isaac says of Bush's
plan: “I don’t know how they’ll
end it. I just don’t see it.”
<l)Bush’s $7.9 billion assault,

‘gdevelop as a result of this grant is '

competency.”

This I will be accomplished
through the Center by developing
programs to internationalize the
business school. “Right now we

have a tragic inability to speak I

the languages [of other
countriesl,” said Zoffer.

Where persons from Europe
might speak several languages, a
person from the United States
might not speak as many, Zoffer
explained. Therefore, a greater
focus will be on foreign language,
training for international business,
finance and management as a
result of the grant.

“This will provide faculty
[members] to do research in
various foreign sites,” Zoffer said.
“We will also bring researchers
into Pitt. ” He added that Germany
and Japan were among the
possibilities which are being
discussed in the proposal stages
this fall.

Andrew R. Blair, a Pitt professor
of business administration and
economics, will serve as the
Centeris director. .

Along with the Katz R‘ schoo1’s
instruction and research,
affiliation with UCIS will align the
Center with’ four area study
programs. Three of the four, East
Asian Studies, Latin American
Studies, and Russian and East
European Studies, were
designated as national resource
centers by the ‘Department of
Education.

Said Zoffer ﬁnally of the honor,
“We’re very proud of it.”

which he hopes will slice drug
use in half in a decade, will be
tested on these battlegrounds. If
his strategy succeeds where other
presidents’ plans have not, if the
nation's commitment is genuine,
these warriors will know it first.
The war rages on:
-In South Central
Los Angeles, paramedics treated
a PCP suspect, a woman beaten
by a gang and victims of a drive-

shooting——then two units hurried
to a second drive—by shooting.
This recent night’s workload
was routine, says Mark Segal,
chief of District 2 paramedics and
emergency medical technicians.
Two men were gunned down

Students in the Schenley‘
Quadrangle are cleaning after
themselves this year.

Last year, university
housekeeping staff performed
the duty of cleaning the
bathrooms in suite. This year,
the service‘ has ceased, in order
to ‘offer the students "an
independent living environment
that is somewhat private yet
ﬂexible to accomodate a
_ student's hectic day, according
to a memo that was issued to

residents.

The university is supplying
everything necessary for the
students to 'maintain their
bathrooms. According to Janice
Skelly (pictured above right), a
sophomore who lives on the ninth
floor of Bruce Hall, "The nice
thing is that I can clean the
bathroom when I want. I don't
have to worry about leaving when
the maid comes in, in the
morning."

Other students are less excited

at the prospect of cleaning their
bathrooms.

Some students have settled
for merely taking turns doing
the dirty deed. But others have
resorted to more drastic means

outside maid to clean for them.

and, in one of the recurring
struggles of their job, tried to find
a hospital to admit him for further
treatment.

The two nearest hospitals were
closed, meaning the number of
patients had overwhelmed the
staff and facilities. But hospitals
must accept patients who can’t
be taken elsewhere within 10
minutes, so the man was driven
to an emergency room.

Even if a hospital takes patients,
they often sit on the ambulance
gurney for up to an hour, delaying
the crew’s return to the streets.

Segal’s district answers an
average of 475 calls per month,
out of a total 207,742 calls in Los
Angeles last year. “Forty to 50
percent of those calls involve
some sort of gang or drug activity.
The two are so deeply
intertwined,” he says.

answer. “You have to teach the

S.C., pop. 27,000, drug dealers
operate openly on street corners,
selling cocaine by the gram to
motorists. Local law enforcers say
they’re losing the battle, but they
fight on.

_ “As much as 75 percent of our
crime is related to drugs and
alcohol,” says Anderson County
Sheriff Gene Taylor.

Taylor’s office has made nearly
80 drug-related arrests this year,
topping the total for all of 1988.

Taylor and four officers
watched the speech on a TV in
the sheriffs office, giving Bush
fair marks for rhetoric but low
scores for substance.

“I didn't hear anything that’s
going to do much to help

narcotics officer Buddy Gilbert.
“I certainly don’t think his drug
strategy is going to do anything

Carnegie library renovation done  

By Milt Klopfer
Staff Writer

Increased open stack area, an
on-line computer catalog system
and interior restoration are among
the improvements that can now
be seen at The Carnegie Library.

“The patrons have been very
positive about the restoration,"
said circulation regulation and
overdue clerk Karen Watson.
“They are totally amazed when
they first see the [improved] room,
especially those who haven’tbeen
here in a while.”

The restoration involved a
complete refurbishing of the first
floor and the stairwells. The walls
have been repainted, the gold
leaf in the ceiling has been
restored and the marble walls
have been cleaned. Work was

completed in March with the

early part of this century. The
room itself, now designated part
of the humanities department,
has been repainted and

provides when the title of a

Big Brothers and Sisters aidyoutbs

By Jerome Lehmann
Staff Writer

People looking for brotherhood
or sisterhood at Pitt have
traditionally turned to the Greek
system. Now they have a new
option.

“The purpose of the ‘Panther
Pals’ group is to recruit college
students to participate in the Big
Brothers and Sisters Program of
Greater Pittsburgh,” said the
group’s president, Holly Beaston.

Currently a sophomore,
Beaston said she learned of the
program and its plans for a
campus recruitment drive at the
annual Freshmen activities fair.
She applied to the program and
underwent the “rather difficult
but worthwhi1e” screening
process required before being
paired with a child.

“[Right now] the group has six
students who have been paired
with a little brother or sister,”
said Beaston. “Children who don’t
have a second parent as a role

. model need someone else to look
up to,” she added. ‘

The group received approval
for official campus recognition

. from the Student Activities Office
injuly. Beaston said that group
ofﬁcers have been determined,
but ‘several other organizational
details that remain will be

. discussed at a meeting on Sunday.
Although the group will receive
an allocation from Student

 
 

   

Activities, Beaston said that
Several fund-raising approaches
will be employed.

Big Brothers and Sisters
Program A public relations
coordinatorjackie Hill explained,
“There are currently 70,000
children insingle-parent homes
in Allegheny county, and 14,000
of these children could use our
services, but we can’t
accommodate all of them.”
Right now the program oversees
196 matches within the county.
In the United States, there are
currently 12.5 million children
living in one-parent families.
Predictions are that the problem
will increase to the point that
almost 40. percent of all children
born since 1970 will likely
experience a one-parent situation
for five or more years.

By realizing the need and desire
for student participation, the Big
Brothers and Sisters Program
developed the idea of creating a
student group which could help
with recruiting, said Hill.

For convenience, the program
will conduct its three—phase
screening process on campus.
This process includes: a two-
hour orientation, a three-hour
training session, and an office
interview with case workers from
the program. In addition, there
are background and police record
checks of applicants. ‘

“The amazing screening
process is not as much hectic as

it is exciting,” remarked Beaston.

Hill noted that the program
asks no commitments of
volunteers. “We believe it is not

' how much money but how much

time spent with the child. Our
office tries to suggest and provide
as many free activities as possible.

“The program is currently in
more need of males, especially

black males,” she added. “Most .

sing1e—parent families are
managed by females, and the
young girls have their mother as
a role model, so they don’t seek
our services as often.”

Both Hill and Beaston
represented the program and held
a recruitment drive at the Excel
Minority fair on Wednesday,
sponsored by the Black Action
Society.

Big Brothers and Sisters of
Greater Pittsburgh is an accredited
institution under the auspices of
Big Brothers and Sisters of
America. Since its creation in 1903,
the program has grown to include
400 local agencies serving over
100,000 children nationwide.

The Pittsburgh chapter’s fund-
raising efforts to meet their annual
$400,000 operating costs include
the sponsoring of several events:
a bowl-a—thon for kids, roasts for
local celebrities, corporate drives
and memorial funds.

After a year of preparation,
a new organization, the Model
United Nations Club, will be
operating this semester.

According to Tim Frank, the
club’s vice president, “The gist
of the club is to get students
together to imitate what takes
place at real United Nations’
functions.

“Students research and study
the issues at hand and discuss
them. Then they do resolution
writing, which is the making
of a statement suggesting a
possible solution to the
presented problem.”

An example of an issue to
be discussed at the meetings
would be the Arab/Israeli
conflict in Palestine. Frank
said, “The club would analyze
the situation and then write a

A resolution. For instance, the

New model U.N. club
encourages debate

committee dealing with this
issue might suggest setting
up talks or allowing Arafat to
come to the United States.”

At conventions with
organizations from other
schools, sessions similarto
those of the United Nations .
take place. The club works I
on studying issues and having
small debates, among
members in preparation for
this event. ,

“The idea of the club is to
prepare for a convention
where we can debate. The
whole point of the club is
getting to learn and debate
world issues,” Frank said.

After increasing enrollment
of the Club by 6/1 names after
the freshman activities fair,
Frank noted, “Last year was
mainly for preparatory work.
This year we have a
substantial membership. The
club seems promising.”

high school teacher and I was

unfortunate enough to have a W‘

couple of students who
overdosed on heroin and died.”

Inspectors’ job is tough; 12
million cars and nearly 50 million
people cross the checkpoint each
year, making it impossible to
search more than a fraction of
vehicles or pedestrians.

Inspectors endure choking
exhaust fumes, noise and
frustrated tourists returning from
Tijuana who wait up to two hours
in long lines that slowly creep
toward 24 primary inspection
gates.

Drug conﬁscation is not the
inspectors’ only duty; they must
enforce more than 400 laws for
40 agencies, including
immigration and Customs rules.

They spend less than 30
seconds on each inspection,
approving the vehicle for entry
or detaining it for secondary
inspection. A

At secondary, a complete search
of the vehicle can be conducted.
Dogs sniff out narcotics and

' occupants can be strip searched.

Inspectors have been getting
tip-offs through Operation
Alliance, a partnership among
Customs, the Drug Enforcement
Administration and eight other
agencies. The task force,
unprecedented A for its
cooperation, uses undercover
agents and informants to track
the ﬂow of narcotics before and
after they enter the U.S.

Says Kenneth Ingleby, Customs
special agent in charge of
enforcement: “I think Bush is on

.the right track. He’s got a total

commitment to eliminating the
drug problem.”

No real need for pledging

This year, young men who wish to becomepart of a
fraternity are offered an -alternative to pledging —-— they

can-become a brother at Zeta Beta Tau without actually ‘

goingthrough the pledging process. A _ g
. Although 7sBT.brothers are enthusiastic about this new
step, other Pitt fraternities have spoken out against it.

Why? It-seems that ZBT is the only fraternity on campus S

taking steps to eliminate the negative images that frater-
nities have established in past years. Animal Houseantics
notwithstanding, the problems that have surfaced are
real; /14 deathsgwithin the past decade in nationwide

I hazing incidents. Pitt fraternities claim not to haze during

their pledging process, and certainly there have been no
deaths on campus to disprove that claim. But a semester-
long period of pledging allows ample opportunity for
possible slip—ups that could be called hazing. Eliminate
that period of time, and you have no opportunity to haze.

Pitt fraternities, other than ZBT, claim that this new
policy will detractfrom, if not eliminate, the brotherhood
process thatfraternities cling to. The pledging period is a
time to prove oneself to the members of the fraternity,
they say. Once completed, the new member is a full-
ﬂedged brother who has earned his place in the group.

“[lFC is] taking away party privileges, and now pledg-
ing,” Theta Chi treasurer Michael Magri said. “Soon all

some fraternities will have left is their brotherhood.” Isn’t

brotherhood the reason for joining in the first place? If the
party scene and pledging process are so important to
fraternities today, then their priorities are not straight.
The brothers of ZBT have had the opportunity to view
the situation from the other side of the fence. The
fraternity in its old form was shut down\ three years ago.
The new members of ZBT are not only the current
members but some of the founding fathers of their organi-

zation. They are not merely carrying on the tradition of -
' past members; they have reorganized their group with

modern-day notions and created the kind of atmosphere

that a rushee would be more inclined to be a part of.
We applaud the brothers of ZBT for taking long-

overdue action. While the other Greeks have been

' hesitant to follow ZBT’s lead, it is becoming obvious that

this will be the wave of the future. ZBT is bound to have
its largest rushing class thus far. That may not sit well with

a other fraternities, but they must accept it, not shun it. To

reject the new situation is to be left behind the times, and
a fraternity, or any organization for that matter, that does
not provide the best possible atmosphere for its members
is failing at its most central point: establishing unity.

To quote the president of Delta Tau Delta, ' Terry
McLinden, “Pledging doesn't make a fraternity. it’s the
group of people.” That is the true meaning of brother-
hood, and the members of ZBT now embody that notion.

“Hel-hello.”

“Brendan, it’s Guy.”

“Who?”

“Guy! Guy Huge, your editor!
Wake up you lazy, good-fer-
nothing bum!”

“Oh, hi. What time is it?”

“Listen, I don’t have time for
your sorry hung—over questions.
I'm calling to tell you that the

"police are planning to raid a

crack house over on -Joe Street.
You have one hour to get over
there and get the scoop. And I
want this story written by this
afternoon. I might want to use it

‘in the afternoon edition. It de-

pends on how much copy I have,
so be prepared!” »

Click. -

“It depends on how much copy
-I have,” I said to myself, mimick-
ing my editor. His statement
meant that he had made a mis-
take calculating how’ many sto-
ries he would need to fill the
afternoon edition of the newspa-
per. Naturally, when this hap-
pens, reporters like myself have
to break our butts to cover for
him. i C

I looked at the clock. It was
9:10 a.m. Ihad 50 minutes to get
to Joe Street. I showered, got
dressed and chugged some cold
coffee from the night before. It
was 9:30. I lit a cigarette and ﬂew
out the door. At 9:31 I re-entered
my apartment after realizing I
had forgotten my notebook,
pencil and tape recorder. I gath-
ered my tools, then exited. _

Actually, this raid had come as
no surprise to me. For the past
two months, I had been working
on an investigative series about a
gang of local good-fer-nothing
crack users. My series had alerted
the police to the problem and
today it appeared that my hard
work was about to pay off. I was
about to receive a climactic end
to my series, the police were
going to get their men, and the
junkies were going to get what
they deserved. I smiled a self-
congratulatory smile as I drove
down Main Street.

At 9:55, I parked my car across
the street from the alleged crack
house. It was not hard to find, a
broken down old Victorian-style

    A parable about good—for-nothing drug users

building in the middle of a posh,
yuppie neighborhood. There was
no action. The police had not

arrived and the area was quiet

I pulled my notebook out of
the glove compartment and began
writing the story as I thought it
would happen:

“Police arrested an alleged gang
of crack..." .,

What seemed like the entire
police force suddenly swarmed
in front of the house. A S.W.A.'l‘.
team immediately infiltrated the
building, knocking down the front

door. Within seconds the I. sus-, -

pects were ledout by the police
with their hands in the air.
“Good,”,I thought, “A simple

 

s

end to my story.” »

I drove to the newsroom and
typed the story with plenty of
time to spare before deadline. I

sat at my desk contemplating my -

success until nearly 5 p.m., when
I decided to go out and celebrate
my possible Pulitzer Prize.

“Hey Guy, do ya want to go out
for as few drinks tonight?” , '

“Sorry Brendan, I told the wife .

I was going to spend the evening
with her.”

“Anyone else up for drinks
tonight — on me!” I shouted.

The newsroom grew silent.

Lighting a cigarette, I left.

When I arrived at Chaucer’s
Cafe, I immediately ordered some
spicy chicken wings and a whis-
key sour.

Then I ordered another whis-

key sour, then another and an-

other and another. After a while
the order became so mechanical,
it seemed as if someone else was
standing right beside me scream-
ing, “Another drink!”

It was raining hard when I left
the bar, quite drunk. As I walked
down the street toward my car, I
reached for a cigarette. When I
pulled out my only book of
matches they slipped out of my
hand and onto the wet sidewalk‘.
“Dammit,” I said, reaching my car
and beginning to fumble for my

keys. I pulled them out of my
pocket, dropped them, then in

A the process of picking them up,

kicked them into a rain gutter.
“Dammit,” I said -again.

Blurry-eyed, I began walking.

home. About two blocks from
the bar, I noticed a bus stop. I
took a seat next to a young black
man who was also waiting for the
bus. ‘ ‘

“Hey man, you got a smoke?”
he said in a polite voice.

“Sure,” I said handing him ,a
cigarette.
He lit the cigarette.
I pulled out another cigarette.
“You got a light?” I said.
“Sure,” he said.
We sat there in the rain smok-

ing together.

“How are you doing tonight,
brother?” I said to him.

“Not so good, man. Not so.
1 good.”

“Really? Why not?”

“I got high tonight."

“Well, we all enjoy a good
high, now and then.”

“You don’t understand, man. I

stayed clean for 30 days, and

nowl blew it." i

“What do you get high on?" I
said. I

“I smoke cocaine. Ya know,
crack,” he said.

“Well; just quit.”

“Really? Do you think I should?”
he said sarcastically.

“Sorry. Well, you did quit for 30
days, right? That’s quite an ac-
complishment. Maybe next time
you'll quit for 40 days, then 50
days, six months, then a year.

Eventually you’ll be off the stuff

for good.”

“Hey, I_ think you’re right. I
guess I do have a reason to feel
good about myself. I can still beat
this stuff.

“Here comes the bus‘, man.
You cornin?" he said excitedly.

“No, I think I'm going to walk.”

“O.K. Well, thanks a lot, man.
You’ve really helped me.”

He got on the bus, and I began
walking home. I was soaking wet
and sober when I reached my
apartment. I went into my bed-
room and pulled out my file on
drug users. I threw it out the
window.

exudes warmth and wholesomeness. You wouldn’t guess that this
man is responsible for some of the creepiest movies ever made.

During a conversation with Romero, you keep expecting to notice
some hint of darkness lurking behind the smile, some ﬂash of the
otherworldly wickedness of his ﬂesh-eating zombies. But this never
comes. He laughs. He answers your questions politely. He smiles
some more.

George Romero is the only legendary moviemaker to call Pittsburgh
home. T wenty-one years ago, he shot a 1ow—budget horror film,
around Allegheny County called Night of tbe Living Dead and created
an international sensation. Done on about $150,000, Night of tbe
Living Dead was the top moneymaking film in Europe the year of its
release. Variety said the film “casts serious aspersions on the integrity
of its makers, distributor Walter Reid, the film industry as a whole and
exhibs who book the pic, as well as raising doubts about the future
of the regional film movement and the moral health of ﬁlmgoers who

V Whether you like it or not,‘ the

“There’s not a day that goes by,”
says Romero, “that someone,
somewhere isn’t watching Night

Romero made two sequels to
this zombie opus: Dawn of the
Dead and Day of the Dead He’s
also turned his attention to
vampires (Martin), killer monkeys
(Monleey Shines) and anthology
films (Creepshow). This month,
he wrapped up an adaption of an

 Asst. Showcase Editor

The Chinese film Red Sorghum
begins with the voice of an
unnamed, unseen narrator. He
recalls the first meeting between
his grandmother and grandfather
in the 19203.

Grandmother is a young bride
being taken to her predetermined,

_ leprous husband in a sedan chair.

A hooded bandit ambushes the
procession. He tries to rape
Grandmother and is killed by the
carriers of the sedan chair.
Grandfather, one of the carriers,
sees the beautiful bride and falls
for her. Soon Grandmother's leper
husband is mysteriously
murdered. She inherits his land
and his sorghum wine distillery.
Red Sorghum tells how these

‘ two people, a woman whose
, future seems set and dismal and
E ’a foolhardy worker who carries

her to her wedding, fall in love
and get married. The time is
marked by Grandfather’s efforts
to win her.

, Some of these efforts are
clumsy, such as when he stumbles

 SJQHUM.

into her house hollering and
drunk, and some are courageous;
his confrontation with the
venomous local bandit Sanpao.
The anonymous narration fits
their life together through the
19203 and 19305 into a storybook
framework which comes to a
bloody ﬁnish with the Japanese
invasion. S

Red Sorghum takes its title from

the wine made by the ‘couple and
their loyal workers. On one
occasion, Grandfather comes
back from wandering and decides
to urinate in the new wine as a

joke, and wouldn’t you know it, y

that batch turns out to be the best
they've ever made.

Red Sorghum is stuffed full of
such odd little anecdotal scenes,
which are interesting, though not
particularly relevant or funny.
Then again, this is coming all the
way from China, so maybe some
of it is lost to me.

The film was made in the
People’s Republic of China in
1987. It is part of a Chinese “new
wave" of cinema, and last year, it
won the Golden Bear Award at
the prestigious Berlin Film

Festival. .

Full of blood and glory, Red
Sorghum has the historical scope»
of an epic but is shrunk down to
an unassuming, manageable size.

There are no more than four or
five characters who have more
than a mouthful of lines. The
acting is earthy and charismatic.
Jiang Wen, who
Grandfather, is especially strong
in the comic scenes.

plays.

The cinematography soaks up
the Chinese landscape without
ever becoming labored. Director
Zhang Yimou’s style is raw but
ﬂexible, mixing up quirky comedy
and tense drama.

One of the final scenes, in
which thejapanese invaders order
the local butcher to skin his boss
alive, is quite startling and
memorable.

Foreign ﬁlms have an audience

out there, and you know who
you are. Red Sorghum is an
engaging, beautifully shot, well-
told -story. China has taken its
place alongside Japan (home of
Kurosawa. and Juzo Itami) as a

V vital ﬁlm—making nation of the

East.
Keeping recent developments
in China in mind, it will be

interesting to see what Chinese
film makers will serve up in the
years to come. ‘ S

a doubt, the answer has to be the
felicitous band known simply as

R.E.M. is the idol of all garage

as the palette for their future

Mike Mills. “The south exposes
you to all kinds of music———
Country, R&B, soul and, here in
Athens, 21 really progressive scene.

' Music is my life, but in a way it’s

also incidental. This is a place we

‘ can come back to.”
R.E.M does indeed return home, ‘

and on any given night, they can
be heard lilting a tune at the 40
Watt Club, downstairs from their
office, which is housed in one of
the town's oldest buildings.
Because of R.E.M.’s continued
success and I undiminished
audience, they can not only be
heard in Athens, but also
throughout the entire country.
The road to R.E.M.’s success
began nine years and ﬁve albums
ago, with its beginnings traced to
an abandoned church. Here,
Michael Stripe and Peter Buck
tamed their restlessness by
forming a band that also included
Mike Mills and Bill Berry.
Cbmnic Town, a promising
debut EP released in 1982, was
followed by Murmur in 1985.
Filled with unmistakable
individuality and zest, Murmur

found itself Rollz'ngStone’sCritic -~ -

Poll Album of the Year.
Subsequent releases, Reckoning
(1984), Fables of the
Reconstructz'on(198S), £zfe’sRz'cb
Pageant (1986), along with
R.E.M.’s vehement stage shows
and extensive touring, led the
way for their much—deserved

.over—the—top success.

Even though their early fans
had already known of their
greatness, they were still quite
surprised to learn that . their
undiscovered heroes were
suddenly everyone’s favorite.

Document, released in 1987,
with its romantic hit “The One I

Love,” made R.E.M. a household _

name.

“We always wanted to be
successful,” says Buck. “It’s just
the trappings that leave us a little
ambivalent — the stadium dates,
the MTV awards, the interviews
and endorsements; we’re happy

.where we are.”

And where they are is in the
midst of new—found stardom.

“After Document, we didn’t
want to make a slight left turn, to
put together a different- sounding
record, maybe one without the

trademark R.E.M. jangle,” says,;_) 9

in Pittsburgh. As far as not going to
Hollywood, I'm the first guy to get
on the plane. If someone wants to
have a meeting, I'll go. Things have
never worked. I've done several
projects for studios which have
gotten written, they just’ve never
gotten made. It’s usually just creative
differences. I’m not militantly sniping
at studios. They do what they do
because of corporate policies, I
understand that

Creepshow was released by
Warner, and Monkey Shines was
released by Orion — every once in
a while you can fit into their situation.
It’s just that most of the time my
ideas don’t ﬁt into what they consider
obviously commercial. Had I made
Night of the Living Dead three years

ago, we would probably now
be making Night of the Living
Dead 5.

There are plans for a remake,
and that might be for a major
studio. I’ve just been lucky
enough that I can do what I
want to do right here by
keeping the productions low.
You have to learn to budget. If
you have esoteric ideas like I
have you're going to have to
bring it in on a low budget.

The Pitt News: You just

Living Dead. _—- that ﬁlm’s

Romero: No, we knew we
were breaking ground in a couple
of areas. But none of us knew it
would turn out like it did. I don’t
think you ever know that when

you’re working: on something. It '
usually happens after — a long I

time after. We’ve been lucky to
see some of the success, but we
didn’t get any of the financial
beneﬁts.

We got ripped off in every
conceivable way by the

chapter in the continuing saga.
The point, I guess, is that we
never really know where we are
going to until we get there."

Although Green's singles hit
the charts in no time at all, it took
longer to cut than any previous
album.

“Anyone will tell you,” says
Buck, “that if you budget a certain

amount of time, that’s exactly
how long it’s going to take. There
is something to be said for going
in and knocking it out.”

Mills adds, “We wanted to
experiment with some new
approaches which reflects how
these songs are written.”

Green represents the character
of R.E.M. Its singles uplift you
and make you feel happy.

“People can appreciate our

music on a lot of levels, ” concludes
Mills. “You can’ dance to it, drive
to it, even think to it, although
music shouldn’t just be used for

‘ intellectual exercise.”

Whether you fancy intellectual
stimulation or an upbeat dance
rhythm, you can get it all with

When we came up, it wasn’t a
time of specialization, we learned
to do everything. One of the
problems with going into the the
mainstream is that everything is
so specialized. You end up getting
into a niche and not getting out.
And sometimes ‘that’s not the
niche you wanted to get into.’I
really advocate trying to do it all.
Get your hands on all the stuff,
devour as much as you can.

We set up a company,
theoretically to do commercials.

[We] were living in this place
over on the Southside, chipping
ice out of the toilet every night.
We just did that for a while until
finally somebody let us make a
commercial. Eventually, we got a
bank loan and did some more
commercials  We wanted to do
serious, heavy social commentary
films but couldn’t get ﬁnanced.
So we did a horror ﬁlm. After
that, people would only hire me
to do horror. Luckily, I still enjoy
it.  But you get trapped. A
director gets pi geonholed just like
an actor.

THURSDAY, SEPTEMBER 7, 1989

Strong second half Vaults soccer team to 2-1 Victory

By Sean Hellman
For The Pitt News

The Pitt soccer team kicked
off its 1989 Campaign with a 2-
1 win over Slippery Rock last
night at Pittstadium.

Pitt got a physical game from
SRU, whom head coach Joe
Luxbacher called a big, strong
team.

The Panthers were stymied
by the Rocket’s tight ﬁrst half
defense, falling behind SRU
when Mike Sims headed the
ball past Pitt goaltender Jay
Kapusta 17 minutes into the
opening period. .

Rocket midﬁelder Andre
Hysing lifted a pass in front of
the Pitt goal toward forward
Sims, who headed the ball into
the goal and, in the same
motion, banged heads with
Panther Scott McCurry, injuring
the defender. 1

McCurry’s' cheekbone was
injured in the collision and he
was sent to the hospital for X-
rays following the contest

Pitt was able to force the
Rockets into defensive mistakes
late in the first half. However,
Pitt’s shots could not find the
net. _

“We didn’t play the type of
soccer we wanted to play (in
the ﬁrst half),” said Luxbacher.
“We didn’t do what we needed
to do to score.”

* Both teams had chances early
in the second half. Pitt’s Heinz
Pak blasted a shot from 30 yards
out which was saved by SRU
goalie Dan Campbell.

Kapusta came up big on his
test moments later when SRU
put a shot on after Pitt defenders
misplayed the ball.

The SRU defense fended off
continual Panther attacks until a
rnisplay in their own end cost
SRU the lead. Scott Alexander
got the ball to the right corner
and made a pass to Mike Blatz
who put the Panthers on the
board from directly in front of
the net. The goal came 19
minutes into the second half.

_ Football team looks to break BC curse Saturday

.,U5'"
I’

By Matt Martin
Editor in Chief
A 3-8 record won’t earn a football team
or its coach much respect these days, or
any days, for that matter. Unless the team
is Boston College and the coach is Jack
Bicknell, that is. - .
So says Panther head coach Mike
Gottfried as the Pitt football team prepares
for its weekend stay in Chestnut Hill,
Mass., where it will open theseason for
Boston College at 1 p.m. Saturday.
“We’re up against a very good team this
week, I believe, a great Boston College
football team,” Gottfried says. “It's a team
with high expectations and a lot of talent."
Indeed, the Eagles have been no
walkover for the Panthers, who have
fallen to BC three consecutive games,
including last year’s 34-31 loss after leading
31-19 in the fourth quarter. The Eagles
won, 13-10, in 1987 when quarterback

Mike Power, this year’s reserve, tossed a

touchdown pass with less than seven
'minutes remaining to play. _

“We've kind of let them slip through our

fingers,” said Craig Gob, who will make

his second start of the season at middle
linebacker for Pitt The‘Panthers opened
their season with a 38-3 drubbing of
Paciﬁc last Saturday.

Boston College allowed one of Pitt’s
own to elude its grasp last year as Curvin
Richards came off the bench to rush for
202 yards, becoming the first Pitt freshman
back since Tony Dorsett to rush for over
200.

The Eagle defense suffered through a
miserable season last year, allowing
‘opponents 29.6 points per game while the
offense mustered 21.5. Opponents
averaged 405.1 total yards, 227.9 on the
ground, and converted better than half of
all third down opportunities.

- But the defense returns seven starters

and has seniors starting at every position
and 17 lettermen returning this season,
causing Bicknell to remain optimistic about
his defense. .

“It is a plus,” Bicknell said. “The majority

of those kids have a year of eligibility left. '

A lot of these kids are the regular seniors
and then there’s some fifth year guys
mixed in. It is a veteran group. That ship
is very important. _ l

“The maturity level we have, we’re just
playing better on defense. ‘I know
preseason, the , defense, in -the first
scrimmage anyway, was a pretty
dominating type of group.” R:

The Eagles also return six starters on
offense, including Power and this year’s
quarterback, Mark ‘Kamphaus, who passed
for 1,323 yards and nine touchdowns,
despite missing five games last year due to
a broken jaw suffered a in the fourth game
of the season against Texas Christian.

Kamphaus was the nearly unanimous

choice of the team as captain, but battled

with Power and dark-horse candidate Willie
Hicks for the starting nod. behind center.

“We had a very competitive situation at ‘_

quarterback. Kamphaus is our starter. Once
the decision was made that he’s our guy it
was great because theteam really responds
to him. We made a decision about 10 days

‘before our opener and Mark Kamphaus is

our guy."

Gottfried doesn’t have the advantage of
using three tested quarterbacks. Freshman
Alex Van Pelt received his baptism by fire
against Paciﬁc, completing 1 1 of 17 passes

' and throwing a touchdown pass in the

fourth quarter. Van Pelt also ran the ball in

W from one yard out for another score.

Reserve Scott Stark completed two of ﬁve
passes in limited action.

If Gottfried’s team does have an
advantage, it is that one game. “I have not
seen them on ﬁlm, " says Bicknell, who did

" The NFC gospel according to The Exalted Rev. Domylu/e

By Thomas Danyluk
Staff Writer

Super "Bowl XXIV will be a
match-up between the Houston
Oilers and the Washington
Redskins, with the Oilers taking
the championship 31-19.
Yesterday, we previewed the
squads lurking in the rapidly
improving AFC.» Today, a team by
team review of the aging National
Conference, where Chicago is
rebuilding, San Francisco
restructuring, and Washington is
reloading for its last Super Bowl

gun of the decade.

THE NFC EAST

‘J’ The Washington Redskins

J1-stdoubtedly have one of the top

\

.3

 

fmtit offices in the NFL. Proof: in »

1988, the Redskins finished 25th
in the league in rushing offense,
at real slap in the face to the great
Washington ground game of the
early 1980’s. So what did former
GM Bobby Beathard go out and
do? Why the obvious - go-out
and grab a couple of top quality
rushers in Earnest Byner and
Gerald Riggs. The wide receivers
and offensive line already give
Washington a potentially
explosive offense for either QBs
Doug Williams or Mark Rypien to
operate. The defensive line is
now once again the best in the
league with the addition of third-
round draft pick DT Tracy Rocker
to a corps that includes Daryl
Grant, Charles Mann and Dexter
Manley. Rocker will be the steal

of the draft. Linebacker Wilbur
Marshall is finally comfortable
with his roll on the defense after
coming in from Chicago two years
ago. What a team. 12-4.
Philadelphia . Eagles’

quarterback Randall Cunningham
has the game of his lifein the
playoffs against the Bears, passing
for 407 yards, and nobody sees if
because of the cotton-thick fog
that settles over Soldier Field.
Kind of symbolic, because this
team still leaves me in the fog.
From what I gather, head coach
Buddy Ryan is trying to become
the next George Allen, assembling
The Over the Hill Gang II. He
disdains rookies — traded away
nearly all his lower-round
selections for Chicago’s number

three pick. He has gathered
veteran castoffs like Todd Bell
and Al Harris to strengthen the
defense. Cunningham is one of
the premier quarterbacks‘ in
football, but he also was forced
to lead the team in rushing for the
second consecutive season. Not
a good sign.

This is a weird bunch. 10-6.

The recent loss of running back
Joe Morris for the entire 1989
season was the crippling blow
for the Super Bowl chances of
the N ewYork Giants. New York,
although it has one of the best
coaches in the league in Bill
Parcells, just hasn't done enough
dealing outside of the draft to
keep up with Washington and
Philadelphia. QB Phil Simms is in

’ the twilight of his career, and the

receiver corps is back to where it
was three years ago— weak. Only
the legendary Giant defense will
keep these guys at .500. 8-8.

It is now time to stop feeling
sorry for the Dallas Cowboys.
Sure Tom Landry was ﬁred in an
dispassionate way. But football is
a business, and with ﬁery new
head coach Jimmy Johnson, QBs
Troy Aikman and Steve Walsh,
RB Hershel Walker, Dallas is in

1 business. Give Johnson time to.

reassemble a defense and the
Cowboys will be a playoff team
in three years. 6-10.

You know the Phoenix
Cardinals are in sad shape if
they dish out 3.5 million dollars

Look for local football teams to emerge Victorious

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

The top two teams in the nation
are taking this week off. No. 1
ranked Notre Dame and No. 2
ranked Michigan have another

 week to prepare for their Sept. 16

showdown. Notre Dame

sufficiently destroyed Virginia 36-
13 in the Kickoff Classic last week.
The No. 1—No. 2 showdown will
be Michigan's first game.
Actually, no one in the top 10
is even squaring off against a top

  
  

25 team. The Clernson/Florida
State and the UCLA/Tennessee
games are probably the best
match—ups. Apart from these, the
Pitt game at Boston College will
be one of the more exciting
games. In other words, there’s
not much to stay home for on
Saturday afternoon. But be
patient, next week will be more
exciting.

from the Paciﬁc game have
healed. Van Pelt will have another
decent game, and the Panthers’
running game and defense will
dominate the contest. Boston
College is an OK football team at
best. Marcus Cherry will have a
big day for the Eagles, but that’s
about it.

Penn State 21, Virginia 17
Virginia getting blown out last

week was a fluke; they’re a good
football team. They will lead

  
    

throughout some of the game,
but one ofJoe Paterno’s boys will
come through. I’m not sure it will
be Blair Thomas, but someone
will. Maybe a big defensive play.

West Virginia 17, Maryland 14

WVU will play badly, but will

come up with a victory over a‘

slipping Maryland football
program. Major Harris will throw
for under 200 yards, and Eugene
Napolean, formerly of Pitt, will
rush for over 100. The T erps will

. keep it close, but lose it at the

end.
BYU 31, Washington State 13

A Thursday match—up to be
won big by the Cougars. BYU
will pass for over 300 yards again,
and their defense will set up two
touchdowns. Washington State
had a good record last season,
but put this one in the loss column.

Florida State 34, Clemson. 10

Florida State has the toughest
schedule in college football and
can’t be happy about getting upset
by Southern Mississippi last week.

out on Clemson. Clemson is also
a very good team, but they’re
meeting the wrong team at the
wrong time.

UCLA 24, Tennessee 17

It will be close, but the Bruins
will start off with a win. The loss
of Troy Aikman will deﬁnitely
hurt, but their running backs will
make up for it. Tennessee is also
strong in their skill positions, but
just not strong enough.

Auburn 31, Paciﬁc 10

OK. I needed a sure win.
Auburn will be the second
superior team to beat up on Pacific
(Pitt being the first, last Saturday).
Auburn is a top— ranked team and
will take it easy on Pacific, only
winning by 21. Pacific will get
their first touchdown of 1989. ’

Temple will_keep it close for a

team will pull away in the second

half.

Julie Sheils spikes the ball en route to the Lady Panthers

‘By Scott Campbell
Staff Writer

The women’s volleyball team
kept its undefeated season intact
last night by defeating the
University of Cincinnati 15-10,
15-10, 15-12, despite an
admittedly inconsistent effort.

“We should have finished the
match a lot earlier. We would get
up and then just kind of relax a
little bit, and let them back into
it,” said Pitt head coach Sue
Woodstra, who’s team’s record
improved to 5-0 in her first season
at the helm.

Pitt opened the match giving
three quick points away with
lackluster play before getting on
track, winning nine of the next 11
points. The first game was
highlighted by outstanding sets
from junior Janelle Lantagne,
including many going behind her
back. However, the Lady Bearcats
clawed their way back before
Shelly Seanor’s hit iced the game
for Pitt.

The Lady Panthers shot out to a
9-1 edge in the second game
thanks in large part tojulie Sheils’
thunderous spikes and an almost

Shells, Dee MacAulay, Lori Silk,
Sue Zonneville, and Kelly Matheis
all combined in keeping the ball
out of Pitt territory.

The strategy worked, and
Cincy crept to within two points,
before Zonneville crushed the
ball into an open hole to give Pitt
a two-game lead.

The last game started much

like the first, with Pitt falling
behind early, then winning nine
of the next 11 points. They then
let the Lady Bearcats get close

Editor 1: Note: Each weele Sports
Editor Chris Bosale, Assistant
Sports EditorM1'lee Rampa and a
guest pmgnosticator will predict
the results of NFL games.

Cincinnati at Chicago: Here’s a
tough one to call. Chicago is a
three point favorite over last year’s
AFC champs, but I’ll go with
Boomer, Icky and the boys.

‘ Dallas at New Orleans: This

one isn’t so tough. New Orleans
will win, but not by a blow out.
LA Rams at Atlanta: Atlanta is
bad enough without all their.

. contract problems. The Rams are

still solid and will win.
Phoenix at Detroit: Both these
teams are pretty bad, it’s just a
matter of who's worse on Sunday.
I think Detroit will be worse.
San Francisco at Indianapolis:

»Another interesting match—up.

Both these team will be battling
for ‘a play—off spot come
December, but, new coach and
all, I think San Fran will this
Sunday.

Tampa Bay at Green Bay:
Usually people are happy to
predict a game that one of these
teams is playing in. It’s simple,
just pick the other team. Vinnie
and the Bucs will win.
Cleveland at Pittsburgh: Call
me crazy, but I think the Steeler
will win since they’reiat home
against the Browns.

New England at NYJets: The
Jets are a two point favorite and
playing at home. New England
has a solid team returning. Go
with the Pats.

Houston at Minnesota:
Houston’s tough, but no one is
going to beat the Vikings all year.
Buffalo at Miami: Miami will be
more exciting offensively, but
Buffalo is too good. Sorry Dan.
Seattle atPhiladelphia: Randall
Cunningham and Reggie White
will be enough for the Eagles.
Kansas City at Denver: Kansas
City just doesn’t have anything to
talk about. John Elway will get
the Broncos going on track again.
Take Denver.

Cincinnati at Chicago: Chicago

Dallas at New Orleans: The

LA Rams at Atlanta: Atlanta
stinks.Why say more? LA by tons.

Thanksgiving. So I’ll bring out

Steelers unanimous pick against Cleveland

name in Italian means “green

Cleveland at Pittsburgh: I’m
going to this game; thus the
Steelers will win.

New England at NY Jets: This
will be a tough one because I
really don’t like either team. So I
say this one goes into OT, with
the Jets winning by a ﬁeld goal.
Houston at Minnesota: When
arepeople going to get it through
their heads that Minnesota is not
as good as everybody thinks they
are? !'I’m shooting for the Moon!
Houston by a TD. .
Buffalo at Miami: Kelly and the
boys will handle Danno and his
inconsistent offense.

Seattle at Philadelphia: Behind

Buddy Ryan, the Eagles have a‘

good shot at the NFC East division
title this season. Add Seattle's
lame defense and the fact that
Bosworth is an overrated jerk,
and you have Philly all the way.
Kansas City at Denver: “Elroy”

put a stop to KC. Plus the Chiefs
will be experiencing some serious

to Mr. Injury himself, quarterback
Gary Hogeboom. Former starter
Neil Lomax is lost for the season,
possibly forever, with his
degenerate hip injury. First—round
pick Eric Hill, a linebacker from
LSU, could should break a long
line of bust first-rounders taken
by the team in the 1980’s. Aside
from that, not much new to report
here. Oh, 5-11.
THE NFC CENTRAL
, The last several years, people
have been trying to write off the
Chicago Bears, including myself,
, and every year the Bears blow
through the division and end up
«winning '12 games or so. How?
And after winning the division

0. last season, Chicago only got

stronger with its fabulous
performance on draft day — DB

Donnell Woolford, DE Trace

Armstrong, LB John Roper, etc.
Now that Mike T omczak has
wrested the starting job away
from that characterjim McMahon,
the stability at that position can
only make the Bears stronger.
Hats off to head coach Mike
Ditka, that’s how. 12-4. ' 9
Sorry, Minnesota Vikings.
' You had your best chance at the
Super Bowl two seasons ago,
until Darrin Nelson dropped that
goal pass from Wade Wilson
which allowed the Redskins to
sneak in ahead of you. Neither
Wilson or T ommy Kramer are
W...) consistent enough to lead the
team through the whole season.
Nelson, the team's leading rusher
in 1988, chugged out a whopping
380 yards. Wide receiver and
offensive line are among the best

corps in football, and the addition .

of LB Mike Merriweather will
strengthen an already strong
defense. The Vikes are a playoff
team, but the offense just isn’t
*53exp1osive enough to get them to
the Super Bowl. 10-6.
\ Call the Green Bay Packers
that team that Free Agent Plan B
wrought. Second-year head coach
Lindy Infante brought in a league-

high 20 unprotected players,
looking for a giant quick fix at
several positions. This could be
the best Green Bay team since its
playoff appearance in the strike
year of 1982, which isn’t saying
all that much. Rookie QB Anthony
Dilweg could win the starting job
by rnidseason, which is currently
being held by Don Majkowski.
The Pack’s new look could
surprise some, but the major
overhall is still in the working. 7-
9.

The Silver Stretch offense. Has
a neat ring to it. That’s the name
of the Detroit Lions’ new passing
scheme, devised by first-year
offensive coordinator Mouse
Davis, which is an, interesting
form of the run-and-shoot. It

appeared that rookie QB Rodney .

Peete would be the man behind
center, but he was injured last in
preseason and will miss at least a

month. What Detroit really needs ‘
'to do is sign Heisman Trophy

winner Barry Sanders, which
would give the Lions their best
rusher since Billy Sims. Detroit is
on the right track. 6-10.

The Tampa Bay Buccaneers?

Well, even though the team upset .

Buffalo late in the regular season
last year, Tampa Bay‘ will be
Tampa Bay for yet another season.
Coach Ray Perkins isn’t doing the
job. 3-13.

THE NFC WEST

The Los Angeles Rams really
are one of the» ‘most talented
teams in the league these days’,

- talented enough to win a steadily

improving division. But one thing
the Rams lack year after year is
the killer instinct. They should
have topped Minnesota in last
year’s wild card game, but the

Rams let themselves get bullied

around by Joey Browner and

Carl Lee and the such. Jim Everett
should have the best season of
his career, especially because of
the ﬁne wide receivers the team

has accumulated. First—round pick
Bill Hawkins, a DB from Miami of
Florida, will really boost a sagging

defensive line. But again, the

A Rams had better startbeing bullies

and shake that Goin’ Back To
Cali image if they want Super
Bowl rings. 11-5. 1

Years of transition are always I

interesting, to watch, especially
among teams still on top of their
game. And the San Francisco
49ers, on top of everyone’s game
in 1988, are definitely going
through one of those in 1989. All
eyes will be upon first-year coach
George Seifert, who replaced the
great Bill Walsh after last season's
Super Bowl win over Cincinnati.
With weapons like Joe Montana,
Roger Craig and Jerry Rice, the
49ers can beat anyone in the NFL.
But without Walsh, the question
really is will they. 9-7.

‘ 1988 was supposed to the the
year of the New Orleans Saints,
and it wasn't. Indeed, New
Orleans finished 0 with a very
respectable 10-6, but something
was missing. Maybe it was the
long ball, which was rarely thrown
by QB Bobby Hebert. Maybe it
was the pass rush, which never
did arrive and thus called for the
selection of Wayne Martin, a 6-4,

265-lb. defensive lineman from

Arkansas: Maybe it was the
disappointing pass defense, once
considered to be among the
league’s best but finished only
18th statistically. These maybes
are still carrying over into 1989.
8-8. .

The Atlanta Falcons are
getting there. QB Chris Miller and
RB John A Settle,’ a second-year
free agent who lead the team in
rushing last season with 1024
yards, give Atlanta a base on
offense. Defensively, the team
has been stockpiling talent for

years. Rookie defensive back and

professional blowhard Deion
Sanders talks a good game, but
enemy wide receivers are licking

their chops in anticipation of

taking him down the pike once
Sanders signs with the team and
steps on NFL ﬁelds. An up and
Carter, Atlanta is. 7-9.

Soccer

Continued from page 1 7
Blatz completed the scoring
with a left footed blast off an SRU
defensive rniscue three minutes
later.

Blatz’s hustle created several
chances in front of the SRU goal
in the second half. Luxbacher
noted a change in Pitt strategy in
the second half.

“We moved Blatz forward (from
the midfield) to put an extra man
on their defenders,” said
Luxbacher. “We gambled that

their flanker wouldn’t move up,

and they didn’t.”

Blatz said the move “gave me
space to move offensively. (Pitt
forward) Scott Alexander played
the ball well in the second half.
We were able to play together,
winning (loose) balls.”

Blatz admitted that the Panthers
did. not have confidence going
into the game. “We only had two
scrimmages.” He said the two
quick goals gave the Panthers the
confidence and motivation it
needed to hold off the Rockets
the rest of the game.

_Pitt’s next game is Saturday at
1:30 against California (Pa) at Pitt
Stadium.

Picks

offense and Minnesota’s defense.
The Vikings are favored, but I
like the “Bad Boys” of Houston.
Buffalo at Miami: Marino has a
frustrating season ahead of him.
It's hard to be a franchise. Buffalo
is a definite playoff contender.
Seattle at Philadelphia: The
Eagles are loaded. Buddy Ryan
has done an adequate job building
and preparing his team to
challenge for the NFC title.
Seattle’s defense is ready to retire.
Kansas City at Denver: The
Chiefs secondary is top notch,
but Denver by a touchdown.

San Diego at LA Raiders: San
Diego is in the same league as
Dallas, at the bottom.
