Changes Bidding System

Interfraternity Council Ap-
proves New Method of
Pledging.

Completely changing’ fraternity
bidding system until it approaches
bidding methods used in many '_eas-
tern colleges, bidding committee
of interfraternity council decided to
eliminate the “twelve o’clock” sys-
tem_.at a meeting in the Phi Kappa
fraternity house last night.

-Features of the new system, as
explained by John Lauler, secretary
of the council, will eliminate the
bringing of men to the various fra-
ternity houses at noon of the second
Sunday following their matriculation

to accept bids.

In place of that, Lauler stated, a
university official will receive din-
ner invitations from all the frater-
nities for .the freshmen. He will

’ open them and notify the new men
' after a period of a few days, and

instruct the prospective pledges to
accept the dinner invitation from
onlyithe house he cares to join. No
fraternity men may be present at
the‘ meeting, or talk to the men dur-
ing the few days between the ex-
tending of the invitation and the
dinner. ‘ -

Johnson-Tyson Clash ‘On
: ' ‘League of Nations Topic

 

 

Roswell Johnson, advocate, and
Dr: Tyson, opponent, of the League
of- Nations, were the principal speak-
ers‘ at «an symposium last Thursday
even'ng before the Politicsrclub.

“ e should cultivate amicable re-
lationswith all the world,” was the
keynote. of Johnson’s talk. -With
America's present. attitude she is
fast becoming a distrusted, un-
friendly nation. - Hementioned the
League’s intervention in the Graeco-
Bulgarian’ war as a "commendable ex-
ample of its eiiiciency. . As for the

. position America would hold‘in the

league, he-said that our -power would
be. tremendous. « - —. —-

..'ro_ Tyson, however, all-the words
eague l‘iad.no' ef-

country, andsuggested in its stead a
peace program. He claimed that to

‘ask Florida to join would be much

more appropriate -than to ‘ask the
United States to become a member.
"If we "join; that bunch of little
countries, we want a-vote that is-
proportionate with our power,” he
ended. - ,

.«. U niied- States’ Drifting
D To War, _Says_ leven.

- ‘“We are drifting into‘-the most"

senseless, irrational, »and ignoblewar
in our history,”

an interview on the current complex-
ities in Central and South America.
“The whole affair,” he continued, “is
shrouded in mystery. The govern-
ment at Washington has a mythical
spokesman who speaks with a hushed
voice about the most disgusted situa-
tion _in the history of our country.”

This feeling of mystery was also
noted by Benjamin H. Wi1liams,,as-
sistant professor of Political science.
“Everything is not known, ” he said.
“There is a desire to have ‘the true.
facts published which would help us
to understand the situation more
easily.” ‘

' “What do .you think of America’s
policy with Mexico?” Dr. Clev_en was
asked. ' .

5‘We are playing the old game of
imperialism,” he replied. “It looks
like an eifort on our part to get
protectorates with a view of ulti-
mately conquering them.” [

’ Although admitting that Americ8.’s
policy is a mild form of imperialism,
Williams does not think that there is
‘any likelilliood of war. “This country
has intervened before," he said, “to
uphold the conservative" government
in Nicaragua. From one of these
governments it secured the right to
build a canal through the country.
The present conservative government
with Diaz as its head is also favor-
able to American concessionaires.
There are fruit, mining, and ﬁnancial
interestsowned by Americans which
the government is protecting.” T .

“But,” Mr. Williams was asked,
“do you think it justifiable to involve
a whole country for the sake of pro-

- tecting a few vested interests?”

“N o, I don’t ”~ he replied.
. “What do you think is the purpose
of the pi.-ainaganda that was purport-
edto have originated in the state
department?” Dr. Cleven was asked.
The reference was to the news dis-

‘patch mentioning a “Bolshevist he- ‘

gemony in Mexico” that was later de-
nied as being issued by the state de-
partment. .

“It is a deliberate attempt to
‘create,.a war hysteria in the United
States to protect our oil and mining
interests. In other words. one hun-
dred and ﬁfteen millions of people
are being made dupes for the pur-
pose of protecting the vested inter-
ests of a few.”

Favors Lifting Ban On
Barred Cap—GoWn Men"

Student council has recommended

 

, reinstatement of barred Cap and

Gown members to Dean of. "Men W.
Don Harrison, following his request
foradvice in the matter from coun-
cil. The vote _on the recommenda-
tion was 7-6.

Petitions for reinstatement from
some of the men, barred from ac-
tivities last May by Harrison’s of-

bation following charges of miscon-
duct during Cap and Gown club
trips, have been received at his of-
ﬂee, Harrison said. Harrison stated.
his opinion that the conduct of" the‘
barred men *has been, with one ex-
ception, . commendable since‘ last
May. Expressing the belief that last
year’s misbehavior would not be re-
peated if the men were ‘reinstated,
Harrison asked student council for
its opinion. ‘
“Responsibility for any official ac-
tion taken in the matter will be as-
sumed by my office. I have merely
asked student council to express its
opinion,” he .said. ' ‘ ‘
First impressions of student coun-
cil opinion indicated that body's dis-
approval of reinstatement. Further
discussion ‘developed into the one-
vote victory for recommendation of
reinstatement. .

DR. CRETCI-IER HEADS
CHEMISTRY RESEARCH

Research in pure chemistry will be
the work _of the newest department
in Mellon Institute, with Dr. Leonard
~C-retcher directing the-investigations.
“While the institute is primarily
"an industrial experiment station,”

 

 

’ DR. LEONARD H.CRe;1-cued
says,Dr.~Edward R. Weidlein, Mellon
Institute head, ,“it has always recog-

source of,-stimulus for investigation
in behalf of industry."

_ ‘.‘During the past ﬁve years the
institute has been giving a constant-
ly increasing amount of attention to
the encouragement ..and_ support of
research in pure chemistry and has
been progressively successful in ar-
ranging for funds to devote to the
prosecutionof investigation not sug-
gested by industry but planned with-
in the. institute and aimed towards
the study of more basic problems
than "those usually investigated for
direct industrial purposes.” 4 -

- Dr. Cretcher, a graduate of Mich-
igan,vwith doctor of philosophy de-
greefrom Yale, will have supervi-
sion. over all the _institute’s' investi-
gation. in pure chemistry" and will
serve as an advisor to industrial fel-
lows carrying on research "in ‘prob-
lems in synthetic organic chemistry.
Dr. William L.‘ Nelson, who has
been named ﬁrst fellow in the new
department, was a member of the
Pitt chemistry staff, 1922-6. Dr.
Cretcher, as a senior fel_low of the
institute, has been in charge of fun-
damental chemical studies since 1922
and.‘ has-‘ published jointly with sev-

. eral" assistants and other members

of the institute a number of papers
on their organo-chemical researches.

Students Get. Too
= A  M uch’ Rope--Lauder.

- “The American college student is
allowed too much rope,” ‘said Sir-
Harry Lauder in an interview here
last week with a Weekly reporter.
“As a rule, American’ students have
more _freedom and more wealth than
any of the students at the Universi-
ties’ of England or Scotland, espe-
cially Scotland,” Sir Harry replied
when asked to compare European
and American universities. - “It
would be far betterif the students
walked to_their classes every morn-
ing instead of riding to their schools
in motor cars. However, the college
is not the important thing--it is the
men who are graduated - from the
colleges that really count.”- The
great comedian also said that, in__his
opinion, the European student stud-
ied.much harder than did the Ameri-
can college boy. , ' «
. In his short gray tweed coat, plaid
kilties, bare knees and pointed,
shiny, bald head, Harry‘Lauder off
stage looked much like he does when '
“roamin? thru the gloamin’ " _in his .
stage performances. His little black
pipe was always very much in evi-
dence. He was either smoking it,

~ pretending it wasﬁa-bagpipe, or ﬁll-

ing it from 6 his ‘leather tobacco
pouch‘. He looked directly_ at the
person to whom he spoke',_the. steady
sparkle-"of his bright blue eyes more
quizzical thansearching. He never-
spokein the same tone. of voice for
any. length of time, but was con-

pitch to ringing denunciations.
