Evaluations

The Engineering Student
Cabinet may still get its wish to
conduct evaluations of engi-
neering teachers.

That’s because the Student
Government Board overruled
its Allocations Committee and
told it to take another look at
the proposed evaluations.

SGB president Todd DeLuca
said the engineers made the
request for funding to print and
distribute evaluations after only
nine teachers in the engineering
department agreed to be evalu-
ated through regular university

procedures. Their plan was to’

give three evaluation forms to
every student in the depart-
ment.

‘The Allocations Committee,
however, rejected the idea
because “they were concerned
about the philosophy of the
whole thing. They didn’t know
whether students could really
do that,” DeLuca said.

However, at its Thursday
meeting, the board instructed
the committee to consider only
the cost of the evaluations -
about $300 —— and not the philo-
sophy behind them.

“The board felt it has made a
commitment to teacher evalua-
tions,” DeLuca said.

In other business, the board
endorsed the student relations
committee’s charity drive for
Children’s Hospital. The com-

mittee wants to sell links for a,

chain that would be used to dec-
orate the tree outside the
hospital.

Women’s Center is Alive and Well

By PEGGY FERRI

There was a point last year when
no one was sure if the University
Women’s Center would still be
here this fall, but the center, look-
ing to change its name to the Oak-
land Women’s Center, is not dead
by a long shot.

The center is planning an open
house on Oct. 25 to let people know
that it still exists, according to
coordinator Gale McGloin. She
explained,-that it will be used to
familiarize people with the center
and its staff.

McGloin said that she expects
there will be time after the open
house to talk about programs and
workshops that the center might
offer.

“We will be offering some of the
programs we have in the past,”
McGloin said. “But there has also
been talk about an all-day career
workshop.” She added that the cen-
ter has also received a lot of calls
from people interested in counsel-
ing, the program she helps to
coordinate. ’

“At this point, not a lot of
thought has been given to new pro-
jects,” she said. The center has been
looking for grants andlother ways
to fund programs.

Pitt decided to cut off the center’s
funding last July, according to
McGloin. However, the decision
was finally made to keep the center
open.

McGloin said that Women’s Ser-
vices of the YWCA helped with the
counseling and Women in Urban
Crisis provided .volunteers to
answer the phones at the center.
The center received support in
other ways when it raised an oper-
ating budget by conducting a
Phone—a-thon.

In view of what has been written
recently in The University Times,
McGloin wanted to point out that
the YWCA and Women in Urban
Crisis are not running the center.
She said these groups are part of a
coalition that also includes the cen-
ter and the university. Cynthia
Vanda, special assistant to the pro-
vost, serves as the liaison.

The reason the center’s funding

was in jeopardy last summer is not
clear, and McGloin said that all she
can offer is her opinion.

“It was a question of university
priorities,” she said, “and in these
fiscal priorities, this one ranked
low." Support for the students is
vulnerable, and the funding prob-
lem occurred at the same time
advisers were being cut in CA5,
McGloin said.

According to McGloin, the cen-
ter seems to serve best those persons
in transition or in need of more
information before making
decisions.

“‘It’s not just a place for die hard
feminists,” she said. “It’s also not a
place that attracts just anyone off
the streets, but it does attract a
mixed bag.

“Students come in to use our
files for their research, men occa-
sionally come in also, and people
come in from around the commu-
nity.” McGloin said. She added
that not very many people have
been in because few of them know
that the center still exists."

Pitt’s new Homecoming
King credits his decision to
run to a very unusual
sou~rce—professor Ted
Windt’s presidential rhe-
toric class.

Tony Bastecki said
Windt’s lectures on former
president Kennedy influ-
enced his decision to run.

Although he said he was
surprised he won, Bastecki
said he had a feeling he
might be the winner towards
the end of last week.

“When the final couples
came out, I saw they were
almost all engineers, so I
thought my chances were

slim,” he said. “But the last
couple of days people were
coming up to me and saying,
‘Hey, I voted for you.’ These
were people I didn’t even
know.”

That's when he thought
he had a very good chance of
being Homecoming King.
Bastecki is a junior major-
ing in behavioral neuro-
science and is thinking
about going into chiroprac-
tic medicine.

He is a drum major in the
Pitt band and is in the band
honorary society.

Like her predecessors,

Seezox photo

Margie Palmer said her elec-
tion as Homecoming Queen
came as a “complete
surprise.”

Palmer, a chemistry major
who wants to enter dental
school next fall, said she ran
for queen for the fun of it
and really didn’t expect to
win.

“It wasn’t so much the
winning, I just wanted to
have a good time,” she said.
“I know a lot of the other
girls who ran, so we all had a
good time together.”

Palmer is a resident assist-
ant in Tower A and was a
former cheerleader.

“If a couple of people are calling
once a day for counseling now,
when even more people know that
we are here, the calls will probably
triple," McGloin said.

The center gets good feedback,
according to McGloin. For
instance, some women don’t have
the money to pay a counselor for
job advice, and so they are in a no-
win situation. They appreciate
that the center exists to help them;
it offers advice for free or a small
fee.

Another service the center offers
is its library.

Although some books have been
stolen during the year, the center is
on several mailing lists and
receives many pamphlets and
journals. _

“Some of the people we get in
here to use the resources,”
McGloin said, “are people who for
some reason, have become aware of
issues, and something has clicked
in their heads——maybe after taking
a Women’s Studies course.,Now
they want to find out more about it.

Winter-
Registration
to Begin

By PEGGY FERRI
And RAY WUSLICH

Registration appointments
begin next week, but for freshmen
and sophomores registered
through the CAS Advising Center,
registration will mean more than
just a change in classes.

So far, .things are going well,
according to the director of the cen-
ter, Fred Koloc, who said he does
not anticipate any problems. How-
ever, if more students register or
there is another cut in advisers in
the future, there will be problems.-

Freshmen will enjoy a registra-

'tion of two separate half-hour

appointments, as always, lrrt for
sophomores, it is a different story.
They still have half-hour advising
sessions, but they will register in
small groups of about five, accord-
ing to Koloc.

“We presume that the sopho-
more registration process is, for
them, fairly automatic,” Koloc
said. “Some advisers have arranged
the appointments so that they
involve groups of common inter-
ests, like physical therapy, so there
will be a common discussion.”

There are 28 advisers, and one
more has been hired to work dur-
ing registration, bringing the total
to 29. In order to have an adviser on
call, Koloc said they take turns. A
hotline was also installed in the
advising center, but students have
not used it much. Koloc said that
this might be because the number
was not sufficiently publicized.

Many students have taken
advantage of the opportunity to
declare their majors early, Koloc
said. There are still students who
have not declared majors after hav-
ing accumulated 48 credits, the cut-
off point.

“I have written letters to them
telling them that it is time to

The Changing Mood of a Holiday

By MICHAEL ROKNICK

There exists in many societies an
“early start syndrome.” The earli-
est of the early starters is, as always,
the United,States. The most preva-
lent example is starting now with
the holiday season--not the Hallo-
ween or Thanksgiving seasons, but
the Christmas season.

The sights of the season are
already being displayed in win-
dows of stores. The Snoopy and
Woodstock tree ornaments caught
the eye of most in a nearby card
shop.

“We think it’s going to be the
best seller of the year,” said the
salesclerk. “Along with the one
that has Santa Claus flying the air-
plane. Isn’t it cute?”

The store did not stop with this
simple introduction to the season.
Wrapping paper, nut crackers and
elves were standing next to jack—o-
lanterns and paper

in retrieving some of its older
merchandise.

some of the more unique items that
are geared toward the Christmas
season. The Santa Claus with
blinking lights in his face and the
stained glass snowflakes added new
dimensions to the art ofdecoration.

Although there were no red
stockings hanging from artificial
fireplaces, there was glassware
emblazoned with Christmas trees
and a season’s greeting for all who
wanted to apply for a credit card in
a large department store. A woman
shopper dressed her infant child as
a miniature elf. The red and white

wardrobe was complete with
nightcap and black boots.

“I just thought I would let him
get as much use out of it as he
could,” said the child’s mother. “It
was a little cool this weekend and it
just reminded me that Christmas
was around the corner.”

The local weather for the past
week has indeed been cool.
Though there has been no snow,
with the temperature in the low
405, how could anyone help but
think of Christmas? The building

might remind one of Rudolph
practicing a trial run over Pitts-
burgh. And what of the row of pine
trees along the turnpike? It's sur-
prising they don’t already have tin-
sel dangling from their branches. It
seems no matter where you look,
there are signs that Christmas lurks

' only arfew moments away.

The department stores are
already showing their credit custo-
mers the latest in their holiday
catalogs. The holiday sweaters, the
holiday ties and the holiday place-
mats are all featured.

In most cases, the stores offer
their credit customers the option of
deferred billing so that they don’t
have to pay for that holiday spirit
until February. New clerks are
hired to handle the rush of the sea-
son. They are the ones who are eas-
ily recognized by the looks of
confusion on their faces. They, too,
are beginning to hear the sounds of
Christmas. One clerk described a
conversation she recently had with
a customer.

“This woman came up to the
counter where I was working. She

asked me what type of jewelery I
had that was inexpensive. $16
explained to me that shejust found
out that a person she knew was
going to be giving her a gift for
Christmas. She didn’t want to be
caught without a gift to give her.”

The children of today are begin-
ning to catch the early start syn-
drome, pointing out gifts in the
stores that they would like to find
under their trees on Christmas
morning. The E.T. doll promises
to be the smash hit of the selling
season along, as do the E.T. board
game and the  card game.

The highlights of the games that
will be sold are those that will need
some power source to work. One of
the big treasures will be the TV
video games that cost $125 or more
for the display unit alone. Car-
tridges are extra.

Children are taking after their
parents in that they too are doing
their shopping with their fingers.
The catalogs offer large sections
devoted to toys and other rnerchan-
dise directed at the younger buyer.
All a child has to do is to leaf
through the booklet, pick out what
he wants and tell his parents. This
way is more efficient than by using
Santa Claus as a middle man.

Speaking of Kris Kringle, no

I longer is he thought of as an old

man with old fashioned ways.
Today's Santa can be found in

-ceramic figures riding bicycles or

balloons or jogging in red and
white shorts.

There has been gossip coming
from the North Pole that this year
Santa may be trading in his sleigh
and reindeer, opting instead for
overnight delivery._ It seems that
§8iii§ 8f {H5 ifilfidggi Wﬁiitgd 35 88%-
cent of the TV revenues and are
contemplating striking this season
unless their demands are met.

The music for this holiday
promises to be even more different
than ever. The major recording
studios are planning to release
Christmas songs that are of-
heaven forbid—a religious nature.

Who could forget the blockbus— r

ter of last year—-the Chipmunks
singing, “The very best of the holi-
day spirit.” Even though record
sales for this year are down by
almost half of last years, it should
be big sales for this holiday with
the Moral Majority pushing the
religious theme.

The only problem here might be
listening to these songs on the
radio. Since most of the stations
don’t play Christmas songs until
Christmas Eve, the public may not
have time to decide if they want to
buy the albums. It is said that some
of the FM stations will run Christ-
mas songs a full day and a half
before Christmas, but the outcome
has not yet been dediced.

With all of the changes in Christ-
mas behavior, it is surprising that
the ever-dependable eggnog is still
popular. The grocery stores were
quick to get out this year’s batch. It
can usually be found next to the
apple cider that was stocked for
Halloween parties.

In order to settle the confusion of
what is “in" or “out" this season,
the following should help. Elves
are in. but holly is out. Chestnuts,
pine trees and snow are in, but
sleighs, lights and train. sets are
out. Cookies without monosodium
glutimate are in, provided they are
made with “all natural ingre-
dients." Irish coffee is always in.

This Christmas season will offer
a new package for some, but for
others it will be stagnant. Maybe
those stagnant people will realize
that there is more to Christmas
than rgligion and love.

declare now that they have 48 cred-
its, so I expect that many of them
will be coming in soon to declare,"
Koloc explained.

There are about 100 students,
according to Koloc, who have not
declared majors and need further
advising. Twenty-five faculty
members have stepped in to volun-
teer their services as advisers. Koloc
said that he was pleased by their
involvement and that although
they did not have much experience,
they went to training sessions and
learned the regulations governing
advising.

Although the registration system
for this term is working, Koloc said
that most advisers are not happy
with the group registrations for
sophomores. , l

“I think that advisers feel that we
were doing a good job before. I've
been here since 1970, and every year
there has_ been steady improve-
ment, but the last two years, we’ve
backtracked," Koloc said.

Koloc urged students not to
worry that appointments will be
booked up or that they will be
shortchanged.

Advisers have reserved time for
student conference appointments,
according to Koloc. He said that
the time will be used for appoint-
ments and for special situations in
which a student must see an
adviser.

As far as registration is con-
cerned, Koloc said that it is the
latecomer who should worry.
Those who come late for registra-
tion appointments will be given a
one-hour appointment instead of
the usual half-hour, but the

appointment will be set later in the
period, according to Koloc.

The advising center is also trying
to advise early those students
whose classes fill up rapidly, such
as computer science and physical
therapy. “We're trying to get them
registered as soon as possible,”
Koloc said.

He is optimistic that those who
most need those classes will be
worked in early. There will also be
waiting lists for classes. When a
student add-drops, the information
about openings will be made
known, and waiting students will
be able to fill vacancies.

The registration period for the
winter term begins on Nov. 1, but
freshmen and sophomores who
have not yet declared majors
should contact the advising center
to make pre-registration
appointments.

Time schedules and course des-
criptions should be available by
Oct. 25.

Come
Together

There may be strength in numbers, as the saying
goes, but how many people are needed before there
really is strength in their numbers and policy makers
are forced to do a double take?

One group may have found the answer.

Although it didn’t receive a lot of press coverage,
which is itself interesting, the National Education
Association announced the formation of a coalition
to campaign for nuclear disarmament last week.
Twenty-six national organizations with a combined
membership estimated at 18 million formed the coa-
lition known as Citizens Against A Nuclear War.

What is important is that it brought together reli-
gious, environmental, union, academic, ethnic and
women’s organizations all in one group. It is inspir-
ing that so many diverse groups can unite around a
common philosophy and under a common name,
and other peace groups would do well to do the
same.

Considering what the peace movement is up
against, there is a crying need for more organization
and communication, and part of that can be fostered
by a broad-based coalition.

The Pittsburgh Peace Network, formed last
December, acted as a stimulus for Pittsburghers to go
to New York last June to participate in the largest
disarmament rally ever. Since that prime time cover-
age of the peace movement, the uninformed individ-
ual might think that the peace movement hasn’t
done anything. But thatjust isn't the case, according
to Pittsburgh Peace Network staffer Suzanne Polen.

But just the fact that it seems the peace movement
is taking a breather after the big rally in New York,
shows that little, isolated groups are not as effective
as they are when they join together with one aim in
mind. —

Polen admitted that a merger would enrich the
groups involved and help small groups move out of
isolation to organize projects that they normally
wouldn't be able to.

But there is a problem that plagues the peace
movement—arriving at a statement of purpose.
Some groups support the freeze, others support dis-
armament, others support unilateral moves, others
support bilateral moves and still others support the
abolition of nuclear weapons in toto.

In order to have an effective coalition, there has to
be less bickering and more agreement—in short,
compromises. It is important, however, for the suc-
cess of the movement that it not lose its roots and
turn its own members into cogs in a larger machine
making them feel that they have lost their individu-
ality. ‘

Before the peace movement can expect the nations
of the world to sit down and discuss disarmament, it
has to do the same. It is an understatement to say that
the issues related to nuclear war are important, but
the problem requires solutions. There isn’t much
known right now about Citizens Against A Nuclear
War, but it has started an idea that, if it catches on,
could increase interaction, communication and
organization in the peace movement and bring it
closer to its goal.

For What

By CHRISTINA CLINTON

“I guess we know who wears the
pants at Pitt.”—Donnie Iris, Oct.
15, I982.

Donnie Iris, the headliner at
Pitt’s annual Homecoming Con-
cert, made that remark after he
staged a shouting contest between
the “co-eds” or “girls” and the
“men” during Friday’s show. He
wanted to see who could scream the
lyrics of “Love is Like a Rock” the
loudest. Needless to say, the men
won.

What does that prove? That men
have bigger mouths than women
and therefore are better? If someone
were to ask my parents about big
mouths, I would certainly qualify
as being able to “wear the pants.”

Iris obviously suffers from an
illness that still permeates our

‘ country—sexism. Sure, the ERA is

dead and Ronald Reagan is in the
White House, but Iris’ form of sex-
ism is more dangerous to our
society.

In an age when heroes are non-
existent, teenagers look to rock
stars to give them guidance on how
to live their lives. Icertainly don’t
want the youth of our country to
groove to the lyrics of “Quit Your
Bitchin’, Get Back in the Kitchen,"
another Iris song.

High schoolers are famous for
driving around in their parent’scar
listening to the Top 40 and taking
it as gospel. I did it myself when I
was 16. The sexist, degrading lyrics
are bound to sink in sooner or later.

Even with the surge of feminism
that hit the world in the past 20
years, rock and roll is still far
behind the times. Take the
extremely popular rock group The

It Is

Who. Their current Top 40 hit
“Athena” is about a guy who’s try-
ing to figure out the feelings he has
for a particular woman. He tries to
reason himself out of those feelings
by singing, “she is just a girl, she’s
a whore.” Do 15- and 16-year-old
kids need to hear that kind of so-
called reasoning?

Daryl Hall and John Oates pro-
vide another example. Their latest

Worth  

Women are portrayed as whores,
users, back-stabbers and liars in the
popular songs we listen to today.
Intelligent people know enough to
shrug the comments off as being an

‘attempt by rock singers to make

money, but I doubt there are many
teenagers who have the maturity to
react in this way.

For what it's worth, I think there
are some rock stars who are making
a little progress. Mick Jagger, the
king of musical sexism, is finally
coming around after 20-odd years
of bugging us with his inane lyrics.
He has gone from “Under My
Thumb”——which is possibly the
worst example of musical sexism
in rock history—to the line, “I’m
not waiting on a lady, I’m just
waiting on a friend.”

He had to reach the age of 40 to
realize that women aren’t bad. If
Mick can do it, others can too. It’s
not that hard.

Many may see this as another
column of feminist griping and

complaining. After all, with the I‘

ERA dead, what is there left to ram-
ble on about? I see this as a serious
problem that must be dealt with
because it is infecting the youth of
America. They are constantly
being fed this garbage by every
radio station in the country. This is
one problem that should not be
ignored or shrugged off.

Roger Daltrey, Hall and Oates
and Billy Joel will never see this
column, so I must appeal to femi-
nists and other intelligent people.
Don’t let this degradation of
women continue to infect our
country through the forms of vinyl
and air waves.

The Pitt‘ News, Monday October 18, 1982

Feeding A Model Citizen

Dear Editor:

We want and need jobs. We live
in either luxury or abject poverty.
Washington cheerfully announced
last week the brand new double
digit, at the same time announcing
that inflation is no longer the No. 1
issue. It seems funny to me that
fewer of us have money, but those
of us who do can get more with it
than we could before.

President Reagan claims that the
“most urgent priority” is to create
jobs. Of course, Reagan is indig-
nant about the whole matter. It
seems to me he’s acting just a little
too much. Shouldn't he occasion-
ally be truthful? After all, he is the
president.

In my fourth grade social studies
class (you remember social stu-
dies), we made a list of the qualities
of the president, Richard Nixon.
Here is the list with a few
additions:

1. Mr. Nixon is a kind man. He
has a cute dog and probably never
kicked him. Besides, he’s ending
the war in Vietnam. He is always
being hassled by all those greasy
hippies and I'll bet he and Mrs.
Nixon are embarrassed.

2. Mr. Nixon is a smart man. He
once said the word“prolification."
I had to look it up and tell the
teacher that it meant progress. Mr.
Nixon probably didn’t have to look
it up.

3. Mr. Nixon is a popular man.
College students love him because
he gave them the vote. I can’t wait
to vote. He has to be popular
because he has a war to fight. I saw
him on the television and everyb-
ody clapped for him.

4. Mr. Nixon is a honest man.
He’s the president.

I particularly like the evidence
given for the fourth one. Yes, the
president is honest because he’s
Richard Nixon—or is that the
other way around? Reagan fits into
that some category, so I can’t ques-
tion the man's integrity, can I?

Of course I can. The presidential
imagists have about given up on
that outdated idea. They have no
qualms about electing an actor as
president, setting him up in the
White House and even watching
him make a few grand entrances.

Reagan only recognizes 2.7 per-
cent of the unemployment rate.
That's not much different from the
U.S.A. recognizing only Taiwan
for all those years. Not recognizing
the mainland didn’t make Mao dis-
appear with a poof . The fact that
unemployment has risen 2.7 per-
cent since Reagan's policy changes
does not dissolve a few million
unemployed into thin air.

Something is quite obvious.
America needs a more intelligent
political gentry. We need educa-
tion more than we need anything
else. We are America. When Pink
Floyd screams for us all, “We don’t
need no thought control," they are
wrong in using the word educa-
tion: “We don’t need no educa-
tion.” We are dying for education
and the ability to have free
thought.

To some, this seems like a round-
about way of making a stand for an
improvement of the educational
system. Doesn't education as a
problem lie rather far from unem-
ployment? Infact, doesn't unem-

ployment mean a logical decrease
in education? If there are no more
jobs, should we go to college?

This is not a good way to look at
1t._The reason for our unemploy-
ment woes is probably related to
politics, and the problems with our
political system lie with our under-
standing of the system. If we are a
society ignorant ofour own system,
how can the system be ours? When
this happens, the government will
be looking down on us, saying,
“our people.” Instead, should not
we be looking at our government
saying, “our servant.” Like good
citizens, we should feed our ser-
vants well and respect them, but we
do not want to be devoured by our
own creation. ‘

I hope I haven't lost anyone. I
don’t have servants either, so don't
write me off as a cashmere snob.
just think of Reagan and his peo-
ple. Think of Reagan and his
unemployed. I hope that if you are
one of the unemployed that Rea-
gan claims, you get your citation
for good citizenry in the mail. I
hear they contain conscription
notices.

A Whole World Out

Dear Editor:

I am writing to inform you
that the Study Abroad Office
has moved recently from the
College of Arts and Science to
the University Center for Inter-
national Studies. It is now
located in ~‘lGl2 Forbes Quad-
rangle. I am serving as the study
abroad adviser in addition to
my responsibilities as the inter-
national grants adviser in the
center.

The Study Abroad Office
provides a university—wide ser-
vice to Pitt students interested
in study in another country.
Students are encouraged to
make an appointment for indi-
vidual advising on program
selection and procedural
requirements of the university.
Extensive files on opportunities
for semester, year and summer
study abroad are available for
perusal in the office. In addi-
tion, considerable information
on student travel in individual

countries is provided. Interna-
tional Student ID cards are also
available.

The number of Pitt students
participating in study abroad
programs is very low in contrast
to the statistics from other insti-

There

tutions of comparable size. lam
striving to increase this number
by working on expanded pro-
gram offerings with foreign
institutions and through con-
sortium arrangements. My
primary objective is to provide
Pitt students with an array of
study abroad programs that are
of sound academic quality and
reasonably priced.

The international dimension
of the university continues to be
a high priority as evidenced by
the university administrators’
meeting in johnstown last
spring. However, it was pointed
out then that this dimension
has not penetrated undergradu-
ate education as rnuch as it
could, nor as much as Pitt
would like it to. A study abroad
experience is an ideal means to
achieve this end, and the Study
Abroad Office exists to make it a
reality.

Homecoming ‘82

Homecoming 1982 is now history.

It started with the King and Queen voting last Tuesday
and ended with a dance at Stephen Foster Memorial Saturday
night.-

Among the highlights was the Homecoming Parade held
Thursday evening, in which various student groups built
floats representing this year’s theme, “Up, Up and Away."
The winner was the combined effort of several Pitt fraterni-
ties and sororities who built a float that was a miniature copy
of the Goodyear blimp.

Following the parade, a carnival was held in Schenley
Quad with booths set up by student groups. Among the
booths were a dunking machine and other carnival-type
events.

The Core provided the musical entertainment for the eve-
ning. Their reggae rock was a welcome break from the local
bands who usually don’t play anything but Led Zepplin and
other Top 40 ditties. The music was the high point of the

A carnival.

Friday night brought Donnie Iris to David Lawrence Aud-
itorium for the Homecoming Concert. Iris proved that he is
Beaver Falls’ answer to teenage party rock when he played
two sold-out shows.

Although most of the concert-goers could not hear any-
thing for two hours after the show, Iris had Pitt students
standing the whole time. The silly grin Iris wore and his
hopping around on stage was evident that he enjoyed his
work.

Following the first Iris show, a fireworks display was held
in Mazeroski Field. A large crowd also attended that Home-
coming event.

Saturday was full of Homecoming activities. The new
Queen and King were crowned. Margrit Palmer and Tony
Bastecki won the honors. Following the pre-game activities,
Homecoming was toasted by a 38-17 Panther win over the
Temple Owls.

 
  
   

Pitt students came out in full force Wednesday night for bar night at several local pubs.

Panther Offense

_ ,4.-‘mm

Comes Alive In
The Fourth Quarter

By BRIAN BALK

The offense once again sputtered
for three quarters before rising in
the fourth to lead the Panthers over
Temple last Saturday, 38-17.

The 442 net yards gained by the
Panthers was their best effort of the
year. The game, however, was
marred by penalties and pass inter-
ceptions. At times, Temple looked
like a powerhouse ready to knock
Pitt off. .

Temple coach Wayne Hardin

-'said in a post game interview, “The
score wasn't indicative of the
play." The evidence: early in the
fourth quarter, Temple closed the
Panther’s lead to seven points, 24-
17. The Owls’ hopes- were dashed
when Pitt scored two late
touchdowns.

. The first quarter was typical of
1982 Panther first quarters-

"uneventful. It was not until the

second quarter that the Panthers
assembled something resembling
an offensive drive.

yard line. Quarterback Dan
Marino led the Panthers to the
Temple 4—yard line with a series of
short passes. On second and goal,
Marino spotted flanker Dwight
Collins alone in the endzone. Toss-
ing a soft spiral, Marino put the
Panthers on the scoreboard with
4:32 left before the half.

The Panthers continued the
offensive roll on their next posses-
sion, moving the ball to the Tem-
ple 29 before settling for a field

The Panthers came out spitting
fire in the second half. With the aid
of several key Temple penalties,
the Panthers drove the ball to the
Owl 36. Marino again connected
with Collins, who used his decep-
tive jitterbug moves on the Temple
secondary to march into the end
zone. Pitt led 17-0.

But the Owls battled back. Quar-
terback Tim Riordan hit split end
Reggie Brown at the Pitt*49. It was
third and 23 when Riordan threw
long to Brown, catching Panther
free safety Torn Flynn off guard,
resulting in a 58-yard touchdown.

Flynn took the blame, saying, “I
was trying to make the big play (an
interception). It was a throwback
curl—-I bit on it hook, line and
sinker.”

The touchdown was the first
scored upon Pitt by the Owls since
1978. It was also the first touch-
down pass against the Panther de-
fensive unit all year.

“They were the first team to hit
us with the big play,” Flynn said.

The momentum shifted in the
Owls’ favor late in the third quar-
8iiL.L again, RfUl(1dll-
Brown combination took the ball
to the Panther 33 yard line, keeping
Pitt’s secondary guessing the entire
way. Riordan then reached back
and pulled out the same play that
worked earlier. This time it was a
Panther mix-up in communica-
tion that resulted in a Temple
touchdown.

“The secondary,’ Flynn said,
“did not have the time needed to
make the proper adjustments.”
The end result was a touchdown
reception by running back Tim

Moore, which tightened the gap to
17-14.

The Panthers’ next drive was
riddled with penalties. Fullback
Bill Beach, who is playing for the
injured Marlon McIntyre, broke
two tackles and raced to the Tem-
ple 35. The play, however, was
recalled because of a Panther hold-
ing penalty. With a fourth and one
situation, Panther coach Foge
Fazio called for a fake punt.
Although Rich Dukovich ran for
first down yardage, an illegal
procedure penalty brought the
play back.

The Panthers did not encounter
a lucky break until cornerback
Troy Hill stripped the ball from
tight end Jim Ermert’s hands and
recovered it at_ the Panther 40.

Pitt’s Offense Still

Not All

By BARRY ZASLOFF

Moments after Pitt had raced to a
38-17 victory over Temple last Sat-
urday, a question echoed through
all corners of the Panther locker
room.

Have the Pitt Panthers, 21 team
that hasfor four weeks running
found itself on the brink of suc-
cumbing to stiff competition,
finally come together against an
ordinary Temple team?

Specifically, did quarterback
Dan Marino, who completed 23 of
36 passes for 344 yards and three
touchdowns, regain the touch that
led many to label him a Heisman
Trophy candidate?

Pitt thinks so.

“You saw what kind of quarter-
back Dan Marino is today," said
Pitt coach Foge Fazio. “He ran and
dodged the first rushers. The only
reason he didn’t rush for more
yards is we told him not to get
hurt.”

“Everyone played at 100 percent
today,” said wide out Julius Daw-
kins. “In the past, either the offen-
sive line was playing well and‘we
weren’t, or we were and they wer-
en’t. But after four games, we all
came together.”

Statistically, Marino had a great
day.‘ He connected with flanker
Dwight Collins six times for 84
yards and two touchdowns. He hit
tailback Bryan Thomas seven
times for 59 yards and Dawkins
three times for 81 yards.

“I had a better feel for the game
today," Marino said. “Before, there
were times when I felt I wasn‘t in
total (‘omi’nand."

Still, Pitt’s performance left little
to savor. The offense, though play-
ing much more consistently than
in the previous four games, fell
short of gelling.

The question that traveled
through the locker room remains
open to debate for numerous
reasons.

Together

0 The 38 points that Pitt scored
was sli_ghtly misleading. The
Panthers’ first score came with 4:32
remaining in the first half. The
final 14 points were scored toward
the game’s end;

0 Pitt lezd by only seven points
with ll:29 left. Temple could have
cut the lead to four, had place-
kicker Bobs Clauser been successful
on a 41-yard field goal attempt in
the fourth quarter;

0 Although Pitt amassed consid-
erable yardage, mistakes kept the
game within the Owls’ grasp. In
the first half, Joe McCall fumbled

the ball away on Temple’s 10;

O Marino was intercepted three
times; _

.0 The Panthers were penalized
nine times for 101 vards.

The defense had some break-
downs too, which is about as rare as
the October snow that dampened

the spirits of the 57,250 onlookers. .

Temple escaped a third-and-23
situation when quarterback Tim
Riordan connected with Reggie
Brown for a 58-yard touchdown
pass.

“I tried for the interception and
they caught me,” said safety Tom
Flynn, whom Brown left behind in
the secondary.

On Temple’s next possession,
Riordan hit fullback Rod Moore
downfield for a 33-yard
touchdown.

‘‘It was a breakdown in com-
munications," Flynn said of the
score that closed Temple to within
seven. “We just didn't make the
proper adjustments.”

All of this circles back to the
original question: have the Panth-
ers finally come together? The
answer is the same as that of the
previous four weeks. They have-——
when they've had to.

“After that second touchdown,”
said Flynn, “we got together on the
sidelines. We said to ourselves,
‘This won't happen again. We
won't let them do itagain.' "

The Lady Panther tennis
team walked over Lycoming, 8-
l, in Saturday’s match.

“It was one of our easier
matches,” said head coach
George Dieffenbach. “It
allowed us to experiment with a
lot of new shots. We took more
chances."

The chances paid off as the
Panthers took five of the six sin-
gles matches, two of which were
shut outs, then swept the
doubles. ii

In the first singles match, Pitt
senior Cathy Jacobson boosted
her season's record to 7-2 by
blanking Deanna Cappo 6-0, 6-
0, while at number two singles,

6-1, 6-0 win over Christine
Vraeland, upping her record to
7-2.

Lycoming's only win came in
the number three match with
Kim Paul besting Miriam Goltz
6-2, 5-7, 6-4. Goltz’s record
stands at 5-4.

The remainder of the match
went Pitt's way, as senior Linda
Stadler and freshman Kristine
Peckman raised their records to
7-2; Stadler by defeating
Geralyn Smith 6-0, 6-2, and
Peckman by beating Mary
Shaul 6-1, 6-0.

Pitt’s Jodi Levine closed the
singles match by blanking
Lycoming’s Anne McGeorge 6-
1, 6-0, bringing her season’s
record to 5-1.

In doubles, Jacobson and
Lafuria rolled over Cappo and

victory over Vraeland and
Shaul.

The number three doubles
saw Pitt seniors Linda Stadler
and Beth Baughman shut out
Lycoming’s Kristine Kuster and
Faith Heaps 6-0, 6-0 to close the
match.

“We need matches like that to
work on different shots,” said
Dieffenbach. “It was a good
tuneup for our next match.”

The Lady Panther’s last
match of the season is this Wed-
nesday at Bucknell. “They have
a good, strong program," said
Dieffenbach. "They beat us 6-3
last year, and we'll be looking to
turn it around."

If Dieffenbach gets his last
win of the regular season, it will
be a complete turn around from
last year‘s 1-9 record to this

Paul 6-0,6-1, while Peckman year’s 9-1 mark, Jodi Levine

and Levine eased to a 6-1, 6-4 continued on page ten

kspikers Dominate Kent State Tournament

1”}-

By MARK A. SINDLER

This is a story about a man with
very unpretentious indiosyncra-
cies. He goes about his business in
a reserved manner and generally
accomplishes what he initially sets
out to achieve. In fact, he could
even be likened to a super sleuth-
an effective behind-the-scenes kind
of guy.

It all sounds somewhat
mysterious—-and perhaps it
sould—but coach Shelton Collier
guided the Lady Panther volleyball
team, as if with the wave ofa magic
scepter, to its sixth seasonal tour-
nament championship this week-
end at Kent State.

The invitational even brought
out the modesty in Collier. He said
of his team's performance, “I
would think that, oh, three or four
good teams had a good shotat win-
ning it.”

But they did not. It sure would
have been easy for them, though,
considering that the Lady Panth-
ers’ strength has recently been
depleted by a string of injuries.

These injuries would have dev-
astated many teams, but the availa-
ble players have displayed the
mettle of steel girders. The team
has played by a philosophy of tight
unity and superb ball-handling.
Simply put, the squad has an
indomitable nature.

This was no more evident than
when the Lady Panthers faced Cin-
cinnati Friday and quickly dis-
patched the Bearcats 15-12, 15-7.
Cleveland State proved more for-
midable, though, and defeated Pitt
15-10, 12-15, 14-16.

Against De Paul, Pitt regained
its composure and defeated the
Blue Devils 6-15, 15-3, 15-9. More
of the same against Eastern Michi-
gan, 15-8, 15-4.

In the semifinals, Wayne State
fell to the Panthers 15-10, 15-8.
Then, in a rematch of sorts, the
Lady Panthers made quick work of
CSU 15-7, 15-10.

As if displaying bionic-like ten-
dencies, seniors Diane Zack and
(captain) Julie Gaul played nearly
every game and were named to the
all-tournament team. T

It was not just the stabilizing

play of these two that permitted the q _
Collier’s  

team to taste victory.
lineup continually juggled tactics;
the lack of subs required him to
determine a distinct starting six.

“At this point,” he said, “what
we are trying to look for is some-
thing to solidify the team. Soon we
will need specific people at specific
positions.”

Sophomore Carmen Tapia, so
far, has played so wellat her middle
blocker spot that Collier plans to
stick with her when injured Ulana
Kohutiak returns.

Kohutiak's injury was the firstof
several to hit the team. Since Kohu-
tiak’s injury, though, the team has
lost only three games.

‘‘I’m real proud of our team
because we are continuing to win.
Under these difficult circumstan-
ces we continue to win," Collier
said.

I That attitude seemed to crumble
when the Lady Panthers fell to
CSU. Collier cited a poor mental
effort on the squad’s part as a rea-
son behind the loss.

As a result, he held a four—hour
practice session yesterday, saying,
“In the backs of their minds, they
think they are going to win
somehow.”

The point has merit in that in
the past—particularly against

Louisville and Georgetown—the '

team lost key matches because of
several letdowns.

Collier spoke of yesterday's
unusual session: “I think we need a
re-commitment to our goal...con—
tinued national success. And to
bring back the lacking intensity for
this continued success. we needed
to practice to execute better.

“The reason I demanded the
practice is that the Big East cham-
pionships are sneaking up on us.
You don't get a second chance
because the Big Easts and l\'CAA’s
are single-elimination matches."

The scheduled practice reaf-
firmed that “losses were all right in

the past, but there must be a reas-
serted commitment. The team has
special qualities, but it will only
keep it by staying on its special
track.”

Freshman Sally Gillespie had no
complaints over the “off-day"
practice session. “It was good
because it made us realize that we
have to work to win. We’re not
playing as well as we should and
the practice was needed.”

Gaul maintained that the spo-
radic lack of confidence is the only
factor behind the team’s four
losses. “That’s the only way we
lose," she said. “Every time we lost,
we were not excited. When we're
up, though, we do everything
right.”

That is conceivably a reflection
on her coach. Collier has not hit
many wrong points yet. He just
goes about his job in a highly

detailed fashion and has slowly“

built his team to respectability.

GAME SERVES: The invita-
tion’s championship hiked Colli-
er’s match record to 29-4—best in

Marino guided the Panthers deep

touchdown.

The Owls retaliated with a Bob

score intact.

The Panthers then faced a third

Dawkins who was double covered
at the time. Dawkins leapt for the
ball, which was drawn to him like
steel to a magnet.

“I had the free safety beat,” Daw-
kinsgsaid. “But the wind hit the
ball, so I had to position myself
between the two to catch it.”

The 51-yard gain was the spark

Navy Officers Get Respons'bility Fast.

Today’s Nuclear
Navy is one of the most
challenging and reward-
ing career choices a
man can make. And
that choice can pay off
while you’re still in school. Qualified
juniors and seniors earn approximately
$1,000 per month while they finish school.

. As a nuclear-trained officer, after 4
years with regular promotions and pay
increases, you can be earning as much as
$37,400. That’s on top of a full benefits pack-
age that includes medical and dental care,
and 30 days’ vacation earned each year.

As a nuclear-trained officer, you also
earn a place among this nation’s most
qualified and respected professionals. So,

the physical sciences,

.rack. Marino carried the ball to the
one-yard line. Beach then plunged
over the top for the fourth Panther
touchdown.

With just over five minutes
remaining, the Temple offense
showed signs of wear, failing to
gain any yardage.

The Panthers penetrated the
Temple defense on their last pos-
session. Again, it was Beach's
vaulting over the pile that gained
the insurance touchdown.

“I was happy with our compo-
sure,” said Fazio. “The game got a
little out of hand in the third and
fourth quarters."

Fazio complimented the Temple
squad, saying, “I thought they had
a great game plan. They’re a good
football team.”

Dawkins agreed. “They are a
team that could hit and hurt you.
We knew they could put the points
on the board.”

Fazio commented on the fine
performance of Marino. “I thought
you saw what kind of quarterback
Dan Marino is today. He scrambled
and threw the ball well."

He was also pleased with the
receiving corps.

“Julius and Dwight both caught
the ball real well, and both of them
had great concentration."

“Today was an indication that
no matter how many penalties we
run into, we can come out and do
what we have to do to win,” said
tailback Bryan Thomas.

Dawkins summed up Saturday’s
team performance best when he
said, “We knew we had the offense.
We knew it would click; it wasjust
a matter of "time for it to come
around.”

PITT NOTES

Many of the players were playing
the game with the flu. Thomas,
Collins and Dave Puzzuoli all were
afflicted with the bug. Tight end
John Brown suffered a knee injury,
the extent of which is unknown.
Linebacker Rich Kraynak re-
injured the ankle that he sprained
four weeks ago. Marino had his
best day in the air, producing 344
yards. A
