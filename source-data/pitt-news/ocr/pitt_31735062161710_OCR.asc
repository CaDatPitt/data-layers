La Follette Party
Taken Apart
I By Two Writers

Pro:

By JOHN BURNHAM

At last+a new political party
which may put an end to the
Democratic-Republican era of
Out of the Mid-
dle West has come the announce-
ment of Wisconsin’s Governor
Philip" F. LaFollette that the Na-
tional Progressive Party of Amer-
ica has been born.

Although only one month old
and still in the formative stage,
the party has attracted nation-
wide interest. For here is the first
third party since 1924 which is
conceded a chance of survival in
a traditionally two—party nation.

Here is a party headed by La-
Follette, a nationally known and
historically signiﬁcant name; a
party born in a period of dissatis-
faction and unrest; a party de-
signed to get the votes of all those
except radicals and reactionaries;
a party founded on American
ideals and opposed to European
standards; a party as yet free of
corruption, connections with vest-
ed interests, and self-seeking
demagogues.

Comment Favorable

Comment has, on the whole,
been favorable. The average
voter says, “I guess it’s all right
if it works.” Independent pro-
gressives indorse it hearily. Re-
publican and Democratic Ward-
healers try to laugh it off, recog-
nizing its threat to the existing
order. Political experts are skep-
tical but admit it could succeed.

At any rate it will ﬁgure in a
small way in November’s election,
probably being responsible for
seating several midwestern Pro-
gressives and Farmer-Laborites in
Congress. After that no one can
accurately predict. But if the
Democrats continue to bungle, if
the Republicans retain their reac-
tionary leaders, if the National
Progressives nominate a strong
candidate, the situation will be
most interesting in 1940.

By ALICE BENOVITZ

Granted that the present two-
party system is very inadequate
and that a third party is a theo-
retically desirable force, the new
LaFol1ette party does not seem to
be the perfect answer.

Every astute political observer
has pointed out that nowhere has
Governor LaFollette set up a con-
crete plan. All he has stated so
far have been rah rah American-
ismgeneralties that any third rate
politician could have spouted. This
is very. disappointing insomuch as
Governor" 'LaFollette’s record
shows that he is capable of much
more. ‘ I ‘

Appeals To Patriotism

A party that sets itself up as a
voice in the political wilderness
has a poor start in appealing to
the easily aroused passions of pa-
triotism-_ and. hopes of a political
Shangri-la instead of appealing to
the intellect with deﬁnite liberal
proposals.

The entire symbolism of the
founding of the party was too rem-
iniscent of the type of appeal
made by the. European dictators.
All that is political sham that a
new liberal party should have no
need of.

From a practical point of view,
the third party movement has its
disadvantages. While it is admit-
ted that Franklin D. Roosevelt has
wavered back and forth and made
numerous mistakes, more liberal
legislation has been passed in his
time than in most» previous ad-
ministrations. ,

Roosevelt Needs Support

Particularly of late, he has veer-
ed to the liberal side and from all
indications he will continue to fol-
low this policy. It follows that
now, more than at any time in his
term, he needs a solid liberal sup-
port.

If the progressive element in
America splits—half to remain
with Roosevelt and half to go
with LaFo1lette, neither side will
accomplish anything. After all,
the president is now in power and
therefore with a liberal group be-
hind him he is in the position to
push much-needed legislation.

So far the present at least, lib-
erals have the choice of throwing
their backing to very possible fu-
ture reforms with Roosevelt or
throwing in their lot with a nebul-
ous party in the hope of a new po-
litical set-up.

Of course, no one is in a posi-
tion to predict the future of the
third party. Butif it is to live up
to its expectations, it will have to
get down to earthand get prac-
tical.

Phi Chi Theta Chooses H iller
Outstanding Senior Girl Bizad

Florence Hiller, BA38, was re-9

cently chosen the outstanding sen-
ior girl in the School of Business
Administration by Phi Chi Theta,
national commercial fraternity for
women.

The award was based on schol-
arship, activities, and character.

Miss Hiller maintained a schol-
astic average of 2.8 for three and
one-half years and had a 3.0 av-
erage in her last semester. This
average makes her the second
highest senior in the school.

Miss Hiller, a graduate of
Schenley high school, is comptrol-
ler ofthe Owl, extension debate
manager, a member of Beta Gam-
ma Sigma, honorary business ad-
ministration fraternity, and. of

Delta Phi Epsilon, social vfrater-'

nity. , -

Two years ago Miss Hiller won
a Panhellenic scholarship and this
year she was given the Scholastic
Plate award by the University
Panhellenic group.

A major in accounting and sta-
tistics, Miss Hiller would “like to
get into government service and
someday become a C. P. A.”

Until this year the Phi Chi The-
ta award was usually given to a
girl in the evening division. This
year, however, all girls in the
School were considered.

There are about 50 girls in the

‘school of Business Administration.

Of these 50, Dr. Charles S. Tip-
petts, dean of the school of busi-
ness administration declares
“They give me much less trouble
and most do work of a very high
order.” -

Science Group

Offers Two
Study Awards

Collembolae To Give
$75 Scholarship

For Summer VVork

Two scholarships valued at $75
each will be awarded to students
of the University for summer
study at the Biological Laboratory,
Cold Spring Harbor, L. I., by Col-
lembolae, natural science frater-
nity, according to William Charles-
worth, C38, president.

Collembolae awards one of these
scholarships annually but this
year has added another in com-
memoration of its 15th anniver-
sary.

SIX WEEKS STUDY

These scholarships—which cover
tuition for any of the four courses
in experimental biology, experi-
mental endicronology, marine and
fresh water zoology, and plant
ecology——include six weeks of lab-
oratory and ﬁeld work for which

six credits are allowed by the Uni-
versity.

In addition to the tuition, ar-
rangement has been made with
the Laboratory for two jobs
through which the students may
earn their board.

The awards are made by a com-
mittee. of ﬁve faculty members of
the departments of biology and
geology. Students who are major-
ing or minoring in the natural
science ﬁeld and who will return
next year as undergraduates are
}eligible to apply.
APPLICATIONS DUE FRIDAY

Application should be made by
letter to Dr. George McKinley by
Friday. The letter should include:
The number of credits completed
in the natural science ﬁeld and the

‘ courses taken; courses expected to

be taken before graduation; the
the courses which the applicant
would take if given the scholar-
sh.ip; the individual reasons for
wanting the scholarship.

Gtwo members of the SFA Execu-

tive Committee. All six. were
elected last night at the first meet-
ing of the new assembly, at a ban-
quet in Cathedral Mansions.

This result of the Assembly
election means that SFA, for the
first time in its history, will be
directed by a united student group
on the Executive Committee.

Choice of the six Coalition mem-
bers has been practically a fore-
gone conclusion since the April 22
elections, when the Independ-ent-
Dental-Fraternity slates swept 27
out of the 30 seats in the SFA
Assembly.

OFFICERS SELECTED

Plans of the Coalition, formu-
lated before last night_’s election
meeting, indicated that the voting
for ofﬁcers would be little more-
-than a formality. Regardless of
the desires of the three Independ-
ents, the Executive Committee
lineup was decided upon and
pushed through by the strength of
the 27 Coalition. votes. ,

Each of the six newly-elected
members of the Executive Coin-
mittee represents an important
element in the Independent-Den-
tal-Frat-ernity coalition. Downie,
Delta Tau Delta; Mayer, Phi Ep-
silon Pi; and Miss Shiring, Theta
Phi Alpha, belong to fraternities
which constitute the backbone of
the Greek division of the Coali-
tion.

Kairys, non-fraternity; Widney,
of the School of Dentistry; and
Miss Whippo, Zeta Tau Alpha,
are equally important as repre-
sentatives of the Dent-Independent
section. ’

COMMITTEE NOMINATES

As was expected by leaders of
the Coalition, voting for members
of the Execptive Committee and
officers went off smoothly.‘ Ac-
cording to‘ the new procedurefor
election, enacted last December" by
change in the SFA constitution,
the six student members of" the
Executive Committee were voted
on ﬁrst. , 1

Following the announcement of
their election, the new members
of the Executive Committee nom-
inated two members of their own
group for ofﬁces- of president, sec-
retary and treasurer.

Nominated for President were
Downie and Kairys; for secretary,

Miss Shiring and Mayer; for treas--.

urer, Miss Whippoo and‘ Widney.

With the election of Downie as-.
automatically-

president, Kairys
became vice-president. '

HOEVELER INTERRUPTSI 1'

Only interruption during the
election session occurred when
Jack Hoeveler, C40, Independent,
objected to the nomination of...its
own ofﬁcers by the Executive
Committee, and to the acceptance
of proxy votes in the balloting.

He was overruled on‘ the ﬁrst
point by SFA President Ernest
Rose, D38, who pointed out that
the constitution made such pro-
cedure mandatory. His objection
to the acceptance of proxy votes
was quashed by vote of the As-
sembly. _

In a business meeting of the
Assembly, held after the election
and banquet, Rose reviewed the
work of this year’s SFA Assembly
and committees.

He then turned the meeting over
to Downie, the new president.

left for pre-registration of stu-
dents in the College, with last
names beginning with letters M

, Cold Wave To Hit

Stadium June 8

HROUG-H the courtesy of Pan-American
‘ ' airways, ostensibly, University graduates
"will have a commencement speaker on June 8.

,:Dl'.,‘\lVlll’lja'l.llll1I‘ Stefansson, arctic explorer,
’and coiisultant for the airways company will
‘be the Commeiicement. speaker, according to a
story on page one today.

The world today is in turmoil due to war
‘tlircats, actual war, danger of Fascist suprem-
"acy. Our domestic problems are tremendous
with what appears to be a permanent unem-
ployed list, labor strife, and possibly ﬁnancial
collapse. _ ’

And -so, what could be less appropriate than
to have an arctic explorer (and representative
for Pan-American airways) speak to a gradu-
ating body? Furthermore, while Stefansson
may be a great explorer and so forth, heihas
already spoken at the University during the
time the present graduating class has been in
school. - '

VVhat more can this speaker say to the grad-
uates than lie has already said?" '

Just what Stefansson’s message to the grad-
uates will be. we don ’t' know. Certainly if he
talks about his explorations there will be noth-
ing new to -students who have already heard
him. If he gives the old formula message (a.
Congratulations, b. lVhat the world has to give
you, c. \Vhat you have to give tothe World, d.
Now go out‘ and do it . .. .), it will be -good clean
stuff but colorless and valueless. Hemay try
to sell the graduates on the idea. of going into
aviation (Pan-American airways), which will
be novel if nothing else. i-

In a previous editorial, The Pitt News sug-
gested that the Chancellor consult with grad-
uating seniors before making his Commence-
ment Day speaker selection. This request was
ignored.

And so, instead of getting John Dewey, John
L. Lewis, J. ‘Warren Madden, or some other
ﬁgure active in educat.ional, or in policy ﬁelds,
graduates will hear a representative of Paii-
American airways who will, we are certain, do
little more than cool the June sunshine as it
beats down ‘upon the Stadium with chilly tales
from the arctic.—L. K., M. R., H. R.

Progressive Party Proves
Political Puzzle

IN 'l‘ODAY’S Headlines column (page one,

column one),'two members of the Pitt’ News
staff debate pro a.nd con on the value of the new-
Ply‘-formed Progressive Party. Vile recommend
that-.. you read ,these,op_ini0n.s,as expressed by
the students, not, of course,—as the pronounce-
ments of authorities on the subject, but as in-
teresting examples of widel.y divergent public
reactions to the infant movement.

It. is diiiicult, at this early date, to accurately
.ap.pra.ise-the movement‘ begun the other week
by Governor Philip LaFollet.te of VVisconsin, to
-express‘ any ‘intelligent opinion,‘ either for or
against, ‘the new “liberal” uprising in the land
-of cheese and beer and progressives.

“We cannot ignore the fact that lVisconsin,

long cor ?'Ti‘13il€tl by the Progressive party native
to that. state, has exhibited one of the most
liberal and enlightened forms of government
in the ll::_ited States. The state has been a
pioneer in social and labor legislation and has
fostered an .:ibove-the-average educational sys-
iicin.

Graduate Becomes Lyrical In Hymn Of Praise
To Blaridishments Of, News’ Women’s Editor

‘,‘You looked so fresh and so alive, full of fun and in love

with"'life 1”

Dedicated to Marion Conn, C39, theabove

‘ ‘ sentiment "’ is

the result of the nation-wide appearance of The News woinen’s
editor ’s picture in a. chain of prominent magazines, one of which
found its way into the hands of a Duke university alumnus up

in Lawrence, Massachusetts.

The story goes that the New
England “Duke” ran across Ma-
rion’s picture
in a well-
known business
monthly. So the
young man de-
cided to write
one of the most
personal letters
ever written to
an editor. ‘

C°m‘ Intermingled
with spots of Arthurian English:
and New England sestets, his
seven—page opus opens:

W00! W00!

“Just before you relegate this
to ye olde wastes baskette, read on
a bit. It seems your old Alma
Pater (Pitt’s too darn masculine
to be Mater) engages n.ext Sep-
tember 5 _in a slight controversy,
based upon a bit of misunder-
standing about passes and touch-
downs with my Alma Mater,
James B. Duke’s select school for
boysyand girls, too, upon a chalk-
marked piece. of real estate known
to all and sundry in the Tax As-
sessors’ office as the Duke Sta-
dium.

.“Wouldst be my guest upon said
occasion to watch the inﬂated epi-
dermis of a porcine animal shut-
tled to and‘ fro, hither and thither
by 22 Myrmidons amidst the
plaudits of the multitude, not to
mention the towering pines of that
clear Car’1ina?”

 

Justifying his interest in her,
the northern poet with a southern
dialect confesses that he was at
one time fired as the feature edi-
to of the” “Duke'Chronicle” by a
woman editor. He sighs, “Ah, but
that was 1934, and time is a great
healer . . . ”

POET COMES OUT

The poet in him comes out with:
“Anthony saw Cleopat, ’
In her closet hung his hat,_

All discretion that was spurned.

The twain they started on a bat,

The Nile was churning just like
that‘

Not Rome, but Tony burned.”

“Ghengis Khan and Kublai, too,
Were notaverse to pitch a woo,
Bold and stubbo1'n—willed,

As for a lady’s hand they’d sue,
And Mongolly, ‘I love you,’

The gals, by heck, were thrilled.”

“__‘That’s the reason _I_ writej-to you,
Hope that you will writegme too,
Only the brave deserve‘ the "fair,
Twenty--seven, Ilveall my hair-. .
I could see your face and sigh,
And let the chance go by

To ask that you and I be friends.
Let history make amends

For my ‘nerve and conceited gall.
I’ve bet my hand; will you call?

Miss Conn will not be committed
but rumor has it that her ﬁrst step
will be to send him a, copy of “The
Pittch Woos.”

Students Show Interest

-In-.Counselor’s Camp

By SHERMAN POCHAPIN 9

With more than, twenty-ﬁve
students already registered for the
course, the first annual training
camp course for camp counselors
gives promise of enjoying a suc-
cessful start.

The camp will be of three

duration, “extending from
June 6 to June 25, and will be un-
der the direction of Dr. John
Dambach, head of the department
of physical education.

SITE IN SOMERSET

The camp" site in Somerset
County was built by the CCC and
is under the administration of the
U. S. Department of the Interior,
National Park Service, cooperating
with the Pennsylvania Department
of Forests and Waters. —

It is planned to make the course
a requirement for physical» educa-
tion majors. ml-t is, however, open
to other students .with at least
sophomore rating, as well‘ as
teachers whomdesirei actual tra.in-
ing in thework. Class periods
will be held in dramatics, camp
music, health and safety, swim-
ming, life saving, sports, recrea-
tion, hiking, nature study, handi-
craft, campﬁre programs, camp
cooking, singing, and story-telling.

Students taking the course will

be quartered, located on the east-,

ern slopes of Laurel Ridge. It is
seventy miles southeast of Pitts-
burgh, near Bakersville and Som-
erset. in Somerset County.

 

when the Federation

This district according to the
pamphlet describing the course, is
noted for the clear mountain
springs which provided the high

I quality ingredients for the “moon-

shine” industry which ﬂourished

at one time. The remains of

.moonshiner’s shacks can still — be

found in the hills of the area.

Dr. Dambach’s assistant will be
Miss Elizabeth Rearick, assistant
professor of physical education.
Miss Ruth Anderson and Harvey
Rocker, instructor in physical ed-
ucation will serve as counselors.

Campers will have the added.
beneﬁt of meeting with the lead-
ing camp directors of this district
of Social
Agencies holds its annual Camp
Institute on the camp grounds.

CARRIES CREDITS
The camping course, Physical

Education "1010, carries four "cred-"

its toward graduation in the Uni‘-
versity.. The cost of food and
lodging is ten dollars per week,
bringing" the total cost of the
course including the credit charges
to seventy dollars. A physician’s
gzertiﬁcate of the status of the
health of the applicant must ac-
company each application.

Registration was to have closed
on May 1, but anyone interested
may still be accepted for the
course by seeing Dr. D:-imbach in
the Physical Education ofﬁces.

Words
of the Wise

FAIR ENOUGH

Broderick Cohen, Hunter Col-
lege professor, discussing new
course on interiiational exposi-
tions:

“There seems to be a new ten-
dency to hold fairs with increas-
ing frequency as a means of cele-
brating national or local historical
events. It is safe to assume that
the need for experts in their field
possessed of specialized training
knowledge and experience will be
increasingly great.”

CHANGING , WORLD

Natalie Simpson, junior at
Texas State College for Women,
in speaking contest:

“This world was created sev-
eral years back, and really will
continue several years more, I
hope. Changing hats, changing
"dresses, changing styles, etc,
are all indications of this chang-
ing world.”

NOTICE-—FROiWI JUNIOR
CHEM SPECIAL ,

It’s a good thing that the anony-
mous writer of that insult to my
ability didn’t sign his name. It
would mean ‘mayhem’ in the first
degree. Personally, I suspect a chem
eiigines:-r. Anyhow, I am glad he
qualiﬁed all but one on the non-
woo basis. but I'm afraid his statis-
tics are all wrong.

Some of the boys may qualify as
stated in that insult to our integ-
rity (?), but the percentage of

daters is a little higher, believe rne.~

Of course, there are contributing
causes to the deficiency of female
connections. Examples: first, classes
all morn-ing and labs from 1:2vl0-5:30,
all week except
course of study including organic
chem, physical chem, advanced
quantitative chem, gas, oil, and fuel
analysis, and technical German.

Further statements substantiated

young men. named: Three have
steady girl friends, either in their
home towns (Allentown) or out of
town (Richmond.) Four have had

Varsity Track
Team Prepares

F or Temple

The Temple track team will
step‘ in front'"of the*fast“ traveling
Panther outﬁt this Saturday in
Philadelphia and try to soil the
untarnished outdoor track record
that Pitt boasts——and chancesare
that the Temple dirty work will
be foiled.

And while the varsity men con-
centrated on plucking the Owl
Saturday, the B team will spend
this afternoon in Slippery Rock
mixing cleats with the local boys.

Coach Olson is deﬁnitely pleased
with the sparkling performance
turned in by his team last Satur-
day. The weather was chilly; and
chilly weather slows down track-
men. Yet the Olsonmen were
able to swing nine events and a
liberal sprinkling of second and
thirds to the Panther side of the
ledger to win the meet by a com-
fortable margin. The teams from
Purdue, 1‘./lirmesota, and North-
western were outclassed and spent
the afternoon wrangling for sec-
ond place.

Johnny Bazyk, who has been
on the verge of cracking the Uni-

versity shot put record all year,‘

clipped the old mark and set up a
new standard. Bazyk hurled the
shot 49 feet 8 inch and rubbed out
the 46 foot, 8 inch mark set up by
Jim Maclvlurdo in 1932. Olson
claims that Johnnny’s new record
may be short-lived, and that
Bazyk -may hit 50 feet before the
season is over.

third in the broad jump. Captain
Edgar Masoin had been disqualiﬁed
for false starts in both the 100 and
220. but Ohl stepped into the
breach, and stepped fast enough
to win both events.

Pete Bennett scored the other
double. After leaping high enough
to win the high jump, Bennett
tried his h:-and at the discus. His
platter tossing was good enough
to win the event. ’ ’

Divisional Pace
Set By Tigers,

NEW YORK, May 10—A
two—way tie for the lead exists
in each of the two divisions of
the Eastern Intercollegiate Golf
League after the first week end
of play, Pittsburgh and Prince-
ton topping the Southern sec-
tion and Yale, defending league
champion, and Harvard gaining
ﬁrst place in the Northern division.
Each of the four leaders scored
victories in both their week-end
matches, Yale defeating Williams
and Holy Cross; Harvard beating
Brown and Dartmouth; Princeton
overcoming Pennsylvania and
Georgetown and Pittsburgh sub-
duing Cornell and Penn State.

HOYAS LOSE

Probably the most surprising re-
sult in the twelve team matches
played was Princeton’s victory
over Georgetown, reputed to be
the strongest team in the East.
The Tigers, who won their divi-
sional title last year but bowed to

I

oﬁ, scored by 6 to -3, winning four
of the six twosomes and two of the
three foursomes.

Each of the divisional leaders
will meet this week-end in the last
general round of play, Yale and

Harvard at Williamstown and
Pittsburgh and Princeton at
Princeton.

66 RECORDED

Eight men in the Southern divi-
sion and six in the Northern went
undefeated in their team’s pair of
matches, each scoring three points
on the basis of one for a twosome
.victory and one-half for a four-
some triumph. The week’s best
individual performance was turned
iin by Harvey Johnson, of George-
town, who posted a 66 for a new
Manor Club (Rockville, Md.)
course record in defeating A. L.

BULLETIN — “Lester Ham-
burg is declared ineligible,” an-
nounced Jack Kotler, chairman
of the Interfraternity athletic
committee, yesterday. This de-
cision deadlocked the ping-pong
match between Sigma Alpha
Mn and the Phi Eps at 2-2.
The ﬁfth and deciding match
will be played between Phi Ep
Marshall Goldberg and Jimmy
Stark of the Sammies.

VVe protest!

Yes, boys, that ’s all Mr. Cor-
ley is hearing these days as the
fraternity athletes ﬁnish up
their drive for possession of the
“words can’t describe it” all
point trophy.

Phi Delta Theta has sub-

ing concerning the sweepstakes of
last week. Headache number one.
Headache number two :is »a protest
from Sigma Alpha Mu concerning
the eligibility of Les Hamburg of
the Phi Epsilon Pi ping pong team.
AIRTIGHT PROTEST

The Phi Delts do not know the
time for their entry in the sweep-
stakes. They base their protest on
the word of an oﬁicial, Mr. Batch-
elder. According to Chuck Wright
‘ and Bill Angel, framers of the
protest, "‘It’s airtight.”

Little is known about the ping
pong protest. Phi Eps defeated the
Sammies three games to one in the
semi-ﬁnal match to go into the
ﬁnals against Lambda Chi. Irv
Solow triumphed over Vic Reiter,
Wally Hirsch took Berny Trumper,
and Hamburg leveled off Joe
Reiter for the Phi Ep’s three vic-
tories. “Tut” Feldman defeated
Jack Kotler for the Sammies’ only
victory. The ﬁfth match was un-
necessary.

SHY CREDITS

The Sammies base their protest
on the fact that Hamburg only car-
ried nine credits.

In the current sport among the
Greeks, mushball reigns supreme.
To date the Phi Eps and Sammies
have each garnered two victories
Ito stand at the top of league A.
Lambda Chi and Kappa Sigma are
the victims of both teams. In
league B Phi Delta Theta has
chalked up two wins and Pi
Lambda Phi has turned back the
Delts in its only game to join Phi
Delts at the top with a percentage
of a 1.000 each.

Today’s mushball games ﬁnd Phi
lGams and Kappa Sigma tangling at
4:15 o’clock and Phi Kappa and
SAM at 6:3'0 in league A. League
B brings together Sigma Chi and
the Delts at 4:15 and PiKA and
PiLams at 6:30. Tomorrow Lamb-

Strong Panthers
Battle Toughest
Foes This Week

After sailing through Cornell
and Penn State last week—end for
easy wins, Pitt’s golfers take on
the toughest trio in collegiate golf
circles next Friday and Saturday
at Princeton, N. J .,~ in the second
leg of their try for the Eastern
Intercollegiate Golf Champion-
ship.

MEET TIGERS

Friday afternoon the Panthers
meet Princeton, proud and unde-
feated champions of last year,
Saturday morning they meet
Pennsylvania, and Saturday aft-
ernoon they meet Georgetown.

This is probably the hardest
test Pitt’s golfers will have to face

in their quest for the title, but all
indications point, towards their
putting up a stiff ﬁghtagainst ter-
riﬁc opposition. ' 5

It isbeginning to. be suspected
that this is the best team in the
history of Pitt golf.

The-sparkling “Big Four,” Sou-

with the help of Lawry and Simp-
son have swept all before them

this season to be undefeated. The
iﬁrst four have not yet been de-

feated in match play.
SOUCHAK STARS

Souchak and Kaye at numbers
one an.d two are the backbone of
the team. Souchak‘ when hot is
the best golfer on the squad, which
can be seen. by his record against
the top men of West Virginia,
Penn State, and Cornell. Kaye is

thesteadiest and most consistent’

of the two having lost only one
match in two seasons.

Melvin, Daddio, Lawry and
Simpson are all heady, experienc-
ed men, the latter two being due
to hit their stride anytime now.
Lawry has been playing in hard
luck so far while Simpson has
been missing out by a whisker.

Only four games are scheduled
today in the Intra-Mural Baseball

‘ League, but two of them should be

above-average battles.

Two undefeated teams meet at
the Stadium this morning when
the Olsen Swedes tangle with the
Phys. Ed. Freshmen. The Frosh
have a ﬁne battery in Straloski
and Rettinger. Straloski heaved
a no-hit shutout against the ROTC
and slapped a double and a sin-
gle; Rettinger clubbed a double
and two singles.

Ed Spotovich, Olsen hurler, al-
lowed the Rover Boys no safeties
in his last start, but was wild and
permitted two runs. Spotovich,
Musulin, Radvansky, and Stapulis
are heavy hitters for the Swedes.

HEAVY HITTERS

At 5 o’clock, the Dents try for
their first win when they meet
the Chem Sophs on the Stadium
diamond. The Sophs are reported
to have a strong team, and the
Dents have already shown their
batting power in their first game.
Eddie Quarantillo and Hymie Gins-
berg lead the hit parade. Mound
weaknesses of both teams may re-
sult in a high score.

In the second Stadium game,
the Starks take on Kappa Alpha
Phi. Neither team has shown any

proficiency with the bludgeon, but
a tight defense and Laucik’s pitch-
ing installs the KAP boys as fa-
vorites.

Meanwhile, the Pharmacy team
goes after its second consecutive
win as it scraps with the ROTC
outfit at 3:30 on the football prac-
tice field. Lucum, Kim, and Wal-
ters do most of the druggists’
swatting, but, defensively, catcher
Hanna of the Bluff team is the
league’s finest receiver. The ROTC
power is about equally distributed
throughout the lineup.

FACULTY VS. ROVERS

Tomorrow the Pre-Dents try to
recover from their last defeat by
knocking off the Frosh Service
team. Since Service 1 and 2 have
been combined, the future plier-
wielders will have their hands

In the first of their home and
home series the Panthers shut out
the raqueteers from Bethany 9 to

Buzzy Greenberg, vest—pocket

SLUGFESTS CONTINUE

Five games are carded for Fri-

1 o’clock in the Stadium with the
Bus. Ad.-Chem Soph scrap, the
Biablos-Scrantonians setto, and the
Faculty-Phys. Ed. Frosh struggle
following in that order.

The slugging Phi Kaps go
against Kappa Alpha Phi at 3:30
on the football practice field.

Last Friday’s games continued
the trend toward slugfests. Work-
ing behind Ed Straloski’s no-hit
twirling, the Phys. Ed. Frosh flat-
tened the ROTC 15-0. The Frosh
collected only eight hits."

Troy yielded the Pre-Dents only
one single in the second game,
and the Phys ED. Sophs grabbed
a 10-0 win... Ptaoek exploded his
second homer of the season for the
Sophs.

Paced by Leber, Sleber, and Bo-
nelli, the Frosh Footballers in their
first game of the day slaughtered
14-0.

The pigskinners dropped their sec-

Frosh catcher, connected for a_cir-
cuit clout and single.

Pulling an iron man stunt, Troy
won his second game of the day
when the Phys. Ed. Sophs edged
out Kappa Alpha Phi 2-1. The
Soph flipper tossed the day's sec-
ond no-hitter, but a walk, two

gave KAP a run in the second.

gions are a potential treasurehouse
of natural resources, and should be
developed as rapidly as possible.

Born in Manitoba, Canada, Dr.
Stefansson attended the state uni-
versity of North Dakota, the Uni-
versity of Iowa, and Harvard uni-
versity. He holds honorary de-
grees from the University of Mich-
igan, the University of Iowa, and
the University of North Dakota;
and has received advanced de-
grees from Harvard and the Uni-
versity of Iceland.

AUTHOR OF SIX BOOKS

In addition to his exploration
work, Dr. Stefansson is the author
of six books on the Arctic regions.
He has received medals from the
American, National, Philadelphia,
Chicago, London, Paris, and Ber-
lin geographical societies, and the
medal of the Explorers’ Club of
New York City. He is a regular
contributor to popular and scien-
tiﬁc magazines. '

Dr. Stefansson’s exploration trips
include two archaeological expedi-
tions to Iceland, and two ethno-
logical expeditions to the Eskimos
of the Mackenzie river delta. He
was commander of the Arctic ex-
pedition sponsored by the Cana-
dian government during 1913-18.

Monthly Trade
ReportPredicts
Gloomy Future

Expectations of a spring pickup
in business are rapidly disap-
pearing, according to the monthly
summary released by the Bureau
of Business Research.

Hopes for improvement were
based primarily on the widespread
belief that after the drastic slump
in production in the ﬁnal quarter
of 1937, inventories would soon be
reduced sufficiently to warrant re-
placements, the report declares.
Stocks in some lines have been
largely depleted, and some new
orders have been placed, but in-
ventories generally are still heavy
in relation to current business
trends. 1

Recent changes in the ﬁnancial
policy of the United States Treas-
ury and Federal Reserve Board
officials are expected to have a
stimulating effect on business.

About the middle of April the
United States Treasury released
from sterilization approximately
$1,400 million in gold, and the
Federal Reserve, Board ordered a
reduction in member bank reserve
requirements, the review contin-
ued. Both measures are designed
to increase excess reserves of com-
mercial banks. V

posed of selected sophomores and
freshmen, will be a feature.

Commanding the University

Auto Driving
Course Added

To Curricula

Summer School Lists
Teachers’ Training
In Highway Safety

‘Working on the theory that
teachers must know before they
can teach, the University has
added a course in automobile
driving to the Summer Session
curricula, Dr. Charles E. Prall,
dean of the School of Educa-
tion, announces.

D e s i g n e d for secondary
school teachers and instituted at
the recommendation of the Auto-
mobile Association of America,
the course will be given from July
6 to August 12.

Two credits will be given for
the theory course and two credits
for the laboratory section.

The idea behind the creation of
the course is the fact that various
, phases of driving are being added
to many high school curricula.
The belief is that teachers, well
grounded with a course in safe
driving and traﬁ‘ic efficiency, will
be better instructors if they have
a specializedtraining.

The course will deal “with the
collection and treatment of curri-
cular materials in the general ﬁeld
of highway safety and traffic ef-
ﬁciency as well as a laboratory to
train teachers how to teach auto-
mobile driving.”

Dr. Harold Spears, director of
curricula and supervisor of sec-
ondary yeducation :in"_“_the Evans-
ville, Indiana, schools, will handle

Campus Beauty
Battle Rages
In Mid-West

CHICAGO, Il1.—(ACP)——North-
western University and the Uni-
versity of Chicago are still bat-
tling for the most beautiful coed
honors, and the former has won
the first round.

The battle started way back
when some song writer wrote
something about “Northwestern
for her pretty girls, Chicago’s‘
where they roam,” and the latest
skirmish was prompted by this
paragraph in a University of Chi-
cago student magazine:

“There hasn’t been a really
beautiful woman around here
since Little Egypt reared her

skirts on the world’s fair midway
in 1893.”

That started a hot argument,
and the appointment of abeauty
judging committee—-and the com-
mittee, working from photographs,
selected Joy «Hawley, a North-
western coed, as the most beauti-
ful on the Maroon Midway.

After the announcement was
made, a wave of laughter roared
from the Purple campus clear
across Chicago to the Midway.--
and the judges hurriedly explain-
ed that the photographer was at
fault for putting a Wildcat coed’s
picture in with the group vieing
for honors at the university that
Rockefeller built.

The Delta Zeta’s took Moving
Week literally this year with the
result that they are now located
in an apartment at 515 Neville
Street. Among the ﬁrst to visit
these new headquarters was the
Mothers’ Club, which held a card
party there yesterday afternoon.

Last week the actives were hon-
ored when Mable DeForrest An-
gelo, provine director for -the
Delta Zeta’s, "visited them for a
few days.‘

sions.

Phi Kaps Display
Twelve Dwarfs
Dwarfs may not grow in size,.

in number, if we are to believe the
display now being shown on the
Phi Kaps’ rooftop. Snow White
has increased her brood to twelve,
according to this fraternity’s ver-
sion of the popular myth.

Upon further inquiry, we learn-
ed that it was the idea of one of
the brothers to have each frater-
nity represent one of the Dwarfs,
while the Phi Kaps preside as
Snow White. In case you are won-
dering which dwarf you are, you.
might stroll over to Craig street
some evening to see the little men.
They are really good‘.

nity, including Dr. John G. Bow-
