Heads Debate
Tap Da_y_Plans

Program Will Be Decided
At Meeting Monday

 

Plans for Tap Day exercises by
honorary activity fraternities.
scheduled as a part of the Spring
Festival program. next Friday,
were held in abeyance this week
pending the outcome of a meeting
Monday of presidents of the vari-
ous organizations participating in
the exercises. .

Original plans called for an out-
door ceremony, to be held on the
triangular plot between State and
Thaw Halls, but in special ses-
sions held this week by the com-
mittee on arrangements, consid-
erable opposition to this plan was
raised and deﬁnite action has been
deferred until Monday.

According to, Anne Kovach, Ed.
'32 and Bernard Windt, Bus. Ad.
’32, who have been active in ar-
ranging the program, the cere-
mony will be held as previously an-
nounced unless the cost of install-
ing chairs and an amplifying sys-
tem for outdoor exercises are pro-
hibi-tive.

Present arrangements provide
for the outdoor tapping with eight
organizations taking part. These
are Cwens, Druids, Mortar Board,
Omicron Delta Kappa, Theta Alpha
Phi, Delta Sigma Rho, Scabbard
and Blade, and the John Marshall
Club. James Marks, dean of Kiski,
school for boys, will be the prin-
cipal speaker.

Scholastic fraternities will tap
new members at exercises to be
conducted, May 13.

city.

Franklin Kallfelz, Eng. '33, who
two weeks ago was successful in
having the attendance limitation
on the Military Ball lifted sought
to have Council defer action on
the rescinding motion on the
ground that the matter should be
left in the hands of next year's
Student Relations committee.

The motion rescinding Council’s
former action‘ was proposed by
Franklin Yellig, Mines ’32, and was
passed by a vote of 6 to 2.

funds were raised by holding so-

by selling candy in Thaw Hall.

Members of Mortar Board, Omi-
cnon Delta Kappa, Cwens, and
Druids, honorary activities frater-
nities will serve as the Honorary
Ushers for this year’s commence-
ment, according to a new— plan re-
leased from the Dean of Men’s of-
ﬁce this week. Formerly the hon-
orary ushers were elected by their
predecessors.

Under the new system present
members will automatically be-
come ushers and those students
elected to these organizations at
next Friday's tap day ceremonies
will likewise receive the honor.

The reason for this move is that
it will give the members of the
honorary activities fraternities
some responsibility and increase
the amount of -recognition given
them for their work in student ac-
tivities.

It is also pointed out that in the
past relatively few of the honorary

ushers were not members of these
organizations.

Monday evening, May 9, when
next year's officers of major wom-
en's campus organizations are in-
ducted into office, a noteworthy
change will take place in the in-
stallation ceremonies.

The executives will be installed
at the same time, instead of at
separate ceremonies as was for-
merly the custom.

Several reasons have been given
for making this‘ change. In the
ﬁrst place.. such a ceremony will
serve to unify the organizations,

THEATER EMBIIIIIE5 IIEEII

“Yes, the theater is very
deﬁnitely ﬁlling a. modern
need,” declared Professor El-
mer Kenyon, head of the drama.
department of Carnegie Insti-
tute of Technology in his talk
before the Inquiry Club, Wed-
nesday.

,“In years to come the pres-
ent era, in play writing and
acting will be known as the
modern renaissance. The
drama has improved over that
of that of twenty years ago
when almost the only kind of
plays were the old classics or
melodrama. The théater is.
going back to its old form with
soliloquies and imagination
after an interlude caused by
the Ibsen stress on reality.”

Dr. Kenyon spliced his talk
with several amusing recol-.
lections of the old melodramas
with heroine and villains.
After his formal talk Dr. Ken-
you answered questions from
the members of the club giv-
ing some light on the work-
ings of the Theater Guild and
the reasons for the success or
failure of certain plays.

Frosh Boxing
Meet__l_3egins

Hold Nine Fights On
Initial Day

With a crowd of about twenty

girls and sports ‘reporters looking’

on, members of the 115, 125 and 135
pound boxing classes ran off their
first round engagements in the
Freshman Intramural Boxing tour-
nament at Trees gym on Tuesday,
April 26. Mats were used for the
ring.

Fabian Mihleic and Joe Pace, the
latter scoring two technical knock-
outs, were the victors in the 115
pound class. The winners of the
125 pounders were Joe Katz, John

Steele, and Dick Zaiden, Billy

Schlesinger fought hard to take
one in the 135 pound ‘class.
Finals Tuesday

The winners will swap punches
next_Tuesday, May 3 at 4 P. M.
to determine the champs in those
three classes.

In the first 115 pound scrap Mih-
leic nosed out Charley Junge only
after the latter had put_ up a hard
battle for three rounds. Likewise
Joe Pace, the North Side Flash,
gave a. good account of himself by
scoring two technicals over Jimmy
Ziph in two rounds and Frankie
Warren in three.

For all-around thrills, the fights
in the 125 pound division were far
out front. Three battles we're
fought in this section and two of
them were topliners. The first
ﬁght was the least interesting with
Joe Katz easily taking over Billy
Parker. In the other two ﬁghts
Dick Zaiden defeated Bill Leroy
and John Steele beat Omar Kron-
enwetter.

Fighting in the 135 pound class,
Billy Ames defeated Abe Goldberg
after a gruelling encounter. It was
Ames all the way but Goldberg

showed the never-say-die spirit
which every college athlete is sup-|
posed to have. The other victory?

Louis Tobin who also showed a}

Fred Brand, Pittsburgh
Boy, Leads Lions

 

Regis Wolff, capt_ain and coach
of the Pitt golf team, led his mates
off to a flying start last Saturday
with a victory over the Dukes, 15
points to 3.

It was the first meeting on the
links of these two institutions, and
it also marked the initial bow of
Duquesne in golf.

Captain Wolff played sensational
golf, turning in a dazzling par
breaking 70 over the hilly High-
land Country Club course, home of
the Panthers.

Tomorrow Penn State will be
met on the State course. The Lions
are led by Fred Brand, Sewickley
boy who was also captain of the
basketball team. Brand is a mem-
ber of the Shannopin Country Club
at the present time and is also
a former West Penn Junior champ.
He is the only veteran on the
squad, but the new men, have
rounded out a well balanced team.

This will be State's first match
of the year. They have their own
course on the campus and have
been lira-Cticing for about a month.
For this reason they are favored
over the Blue and Gold.

The men who have been selected
to represent the Panthers are Re-
gis and Charles Wolff, Henry Deck
er and William Bernachy.

ity sweepstakes, will be run off.

The route for this year's sweep-
stakes will be slightly diiferent
from that of last year. The push-
mobiles will shove off from the
Book store and race along Bayard
street to Belletield avenue. From
there the carts will continue to

Schenley High School and down the
boulevard to the Twentieth Cen-
tury club, which is the

Belleﬁeld street and at the stop
light in front of Schcnle-y ‘High.
Present Three Trophies.

Trophies will be given to the
teams ﬁnishing ﬁrst, second and
third.

Because of the number of fra-
ternities entered and the dangers
involved, the race will be run in
two heats or more, and the teams
scoring the best times will be de-
clared the winners.

Only students carrying twelve- or
more credits are eligible, except
second semester seniors at the dis-
cretion of the Dean. Engineering

work are also eligible. Any stu-
dent who has not passed twelve
credits in his previous semester,
except in the case of ﬁrst semester
freshmen, is not eligible.

An eligibility list of not more
than eight names must be submit-
ted to Mr. Biddles’ office before
12:00 o’clock next Tuesday, and no
changes may be made after that
time.

Check Changes.

A fraternity team shall consist
of one driver and four pushers, and
no alternate may be substituted
after the race has started. Changes
of pushers shall be made within
the spaces marked and allotted by
each checker, and violations of this
rule shall disqualify the team con-
cerned..

Sixteen campus fraternities have
entered the track meet to compete
for two handsome meet trophies
and a separate cup tor the winner
of the special 880 yard relay race.

Each fraternity has been given
a list of events and rules, which is
to be ﬁlled out and submitted to
Mr. Biddle’s office by 12:00 o'clock
noon next Tuesday.

There are ten events as follows:
100, 220 and 440 yard dashes; the
120 yard low hurdles; the high
jump and running broad jump;
the 16 pound shot put; the hop,
Step and jump; the baseball throw,
and the 880 yard relay.

List New Events.

The 880 yard relay and the base-
ball throw are appearing on the
list for the ﬁrst time. The winners
of the relay will receive a trophy.
but they will not receive any points
toward the team championship.

No varsity track letterman or
member of the present freshman
or varsity track team is eligible to
participate in the meet. Cross-
country men are eligible, provided
they do not come under the other
provisions noted here.

The other provisions for eligibil-

active fraternity pledges and mem-
bers are allowed to compete and
the names of all participants must
be submitted to and certiﬁed by
Mr, Biddle. _

Each fraternity may enter but
two men in each event. No man is
eligible to compete in more than
three events, the 880 yard relay ex-
cluded.

Fresh from a. 9 to 0 victory over
the Duquesne Dukes on the Blue
and Red courts last Saturday in
which the Dukes failed to win a
single set, the Pitt netters are all
set for the coming week's matches.
Three matches are scheduled in
the next four days.

Bethany for a match with the rep-
resentatives of that school. Be-th-

These three matches should real-

Nine matches will be played in

with Spring here to stay, and
prosperity still around the corner,

happy days are still out of sight
for some of the University's foot-
ball talent. _

Those who thought the spring
sessions ended with the practice
game last Saturday were tapped
gently on the broad of the back and
informed that they were wanted to
demonstrate the finer points of
football to the high school coach-
es in conjunction with the twenty-
fifth annual University of Pitts-
burgh Interscholastic Track and
Field meet, to be held at the Sta-
dium, May 7.

Coach Sutherland is still unde-
cided as to the method that will be
used, and will likely ask the coach-
es what parts of the game they
want demonstrated. As usual, most
of the coaches will not want to be
bothered with fundamentals, but
will want to be shown plays. and
will feel disappointed if the ex-
tremely technical, unstoppable,
sure-scoring, “perfect play,’’ is not
demonstrated.

Two full teams, and the entire
coaching body will demonstrate at
the clinic. The demonstrations will
likely last for at least four or five
hours, and at its conclusion, the
track and field events Will be held-

(A pause, lloud huzzas, and our
magic Underwood takes us back-
stage to the varsity-scrub football
frac-as last Saturday.)

If the work accomplished during
the past spring football sessions,
which ended last Saturday, can be
taken as an indication of what the
Panther opponents are in for,
freshmen will be used more than
ever. As a rule, very few frosh
stars have made the varsity sit up.
and, of course_ take notice; but
three up and coming frosh stars
threaten to perfor_m the death-defy
ing. stupendous feat. Ormiston,
Weinstock and Hoehl hold the rail
for their respective berths, and
with unemployment at its present
stage, the three can be expected to
put up quite a fight for their jobs.

Now for the game itself, The
scrubs won over the varsity, 13 to
6, but as matters stand, the vic-
tory itself does not me-an much to
either team. It is extremely hard
for any team to gain ground
against opponents who know the

plays. Then too, the varsity are
more than likely to look upon their
les-ser brethren with scatching

glances, and will scorn them while
the scrubs will ﬁght to the very bit-
ter end to win over their fellow
players.

37 Schools

New Castle Star Entered.
In Four Events

The largest entry list in years
has been ‘accumulating in the ath-
letic office during the past month,
and already 37 high schools have
signified their intention of enter-
ing the University's twenty-fifth
annual Interscholastic Track and
Field meet.

Schools from the district and out
of town are sending their hopes;
and, without a doubt, the ﬁeld will
contain the greatest array of scho-
lastic talent ever assembled in the
stadium.

Although it was originally an-
nounced that no other track meet
would be held the day of the Pitt
meet, two other schools have an-
nounced their intention to hold
meets on May 7. Both Geneva and
Penn State are holding scholastic
meets on that day, and although
they are ‘txpected to draw away
some entries from the Pitt meet,
the Stadium will be the haven of
more track men than those of eith-
er of the other two schools.

Besides those schools already en-
tered, Ford City, South Browns-
ville, Monongahela City, Latrobe,
McDonald, Salem, (Ohio), and Ray-
en, (Youngstown), are expected to
return their entry blanks before
the end of the week.

blew Tuition Charges

1 PE “A” STUDENT who desires to take extra credits before grad-
 uation and the student who fails a required course will be the
 oiily individuals to suffer hardships under the new plan of tuition
charges, as announced this week by the Board of Trustees.
Hereafter, should the student with high grades wish to take
7 credits in excess of the average ﬁfteen per semester, his tuition
charge will be increased at the rate of $10 per extra credit. There
might be some objection to the penalty thus placed upon the good
(‘scholar who is ambitious and capable enough to carry the extra
’ work.
1‘ Looking at it from the intensely practical side, however, the
w decision of the Trustees seems to be fully justiﬂed. Students will
-I  charged in proportion to the amount of work accomplished.
" P Those ‘taking less than the average ﬁfteen credits a semester will
~ ’ C nger have to bear the cost of granting extra credits without
,' éharg'e‘to students of good grades.
7 “As for the “ﬂunkers,” they will ﬁnd the new plan to their dis-
, advantage. Extra charges will be made for the repetition of
-courses in which students have failed. This condition, however,
(‘may result in each student accepting his” courses more seriously,
for he will soon -realize that he has paid a deﬁnite amount for them,
"and failure in any one subject means extra expense at a later date.
5  ._ .The vast majority of students will find the new arrangements
5 distinctly to their advantage. They pay only in proportion to the
amount of work taken. There is no minimum tuition charge, such
. as now exists for all credits in excess of eleven. Since the greater
‘ A part of the student body thus stands to gain by the new plan, it
I may be considered entirely fair and equitable.

# Election Day

. “VF YOU ARE A conscientious student, you will go to the polls

, today to elect a new Student Council. Because the form of the
‘ 7:] campus governing body has been so fundamentally altered, interest
_ ,,jin_the election is running at what might be termed an “unprece-
 ' dented clip.” -
P‘ ' Disatisfactions with the revised form of student government
Vhave already been heard. The internal election procedure whereby
V two members are carried over in next year’s Council, is the prin-
cipal target for criticism, and perhaps deservedly so. There is no
‘ particular advantage in providing for a continuity of membership
~ when only two students are concerned, and the procedure does
’create considerable confusion and dissatisfaction. One has only to
witness the present case where no man enrolled in the College is
eligible to run for Council because of the recent internal election
of Paul Best, as Senior representative, and because of the further
1’.9(l1ilrement_ that one of the two candidates from the College must
be a coed. -
, But the important thing to bear in mind today is the task of
 ‘ making this an “unpolitical election.” Neither the Weekly nor any
,3 otherfmedium can foster much of a reform movement in campus
elections at this late date. But the opinion of hundreds of stu-
dents who are not affiliated with any “prestige-seeking organiza-
;  “tion” can be presented. What is the use of an election that is only
 3 superﬂuous formality? Wouldn’t it be good to do away with a
predetermined election and to have a fair, open vote on the nomé
inees?

Vote as your judgment tells you to vote and not as the “crowd”
does. College students should be independent enough in making
decisions to ignore entreaties of the politically minded, who may
have the proverbial axe to grind.

Carnegie Tests

IN MAKING PARTICIPATION in the Carnegie Foundation Tests

for the Advancement of Teaching purely voluntarily upon the
, part of graduating students, the University breaks away from the
C . \ survey which has been under way for the past four years.
Members of the present Senior class in Pennsylvania colleges
, were tested upon graduation from high school. They were. again
. tested at the end oftheir Sophomore year in college, and tests will
 conducted for the third time this Spring at the conclusion of the
«four-year courses.
As the survey has worked out, however, it has been to the dis-
advantage of the larger institutions such as Penn State, University
- of Pennsylvania and Pitt.-. A number of smaller schools have incor-
.‘ porated the tests as part of the regular curriculum, and students
are required to pass the examinations with a certain average be-
~ -fore they are awarded a degree. Special preparation is made for
I 5 , the tests.
In the larger schools it was impossible to devote the time and
individual preparation for the tests, so that the results ob-
tained from these institutions were obviously unfair when compared
with the results from the smaller Pennsylvania colleges.
2 . ~The administration has acted wisely in making participation 9.

Give Plaque for _Best
Fraternity Turnout

 

 

Fraternities on the campus will
have the chance to win an engrav-
ed plaque on Varsity Night to be
held next Friday night at Taylor
Allderdice High school, Shady and
Forward avenues. An authentic
count of all the active and pledge
members from each house will be
taken, and the fraternity having
the largest percentage present Fri-
day night will be presented with
the plaque.

James ‘H. Potts, assistant profes-
sor of physical education_ has in-
formed Sunny Weslager that he
will contribute a juggling act in
addition to other acrobatic features
on the program.

Several acts of the program have
already been arranged. Included in
these acts is Stanford Chester, of
this year’s,Cap and Gown show,
“The Silver Domino." Chester will
give a feminine impersonation, sim-
ilar to the one he gave in the show.
Emeric Formichella and Charles F.
Beck have written comic sketches
which they intend to portray. One
of the features of the show will be
a. “hog-calling” skit. Hogs will be
called by Paul (Rip) Collins and
Melvin (Buzz) Brown, varsity foot-
ball players. Myron Shuler, pianist
will do a novelty piano number.
The final act to date is a take-off
on a. boxing match, and will be
done by Joe Orsini’s boxing prote-
ges. Plans for numerous other acts
are still tentative and will be an-
nounced later. .

George Taylor has been appoint-
ed on the Varsity Night committee
as stage manager. Other members
of the committee are: Charlotte
Walker, Ruth Malone, William
Beck, Charles Beck, Gene Whit-
latch and William T. Devlin. Sunny
Weslager, editor of the Pitt Pan-
ther, is general chairman. .

In the engineering school four
sophomore men, Kenneth Host,
Louis Blum, John Holbrook and
W. D. Grove are the candidates for
junior engineering councillor.
Franklin Kallfelz was the member

 

‘elected internally to senior mem-

bership in that school.

The School of Mines is evenly
divided with two candidates run-
ning for each position. David
Sawyer and Edmund Breene, Jr.,
are the candidates out for the
senior post, while Bernard Curran
is running against Arnold Suba in
the contest for the junior member-‘

Placing of the names of the Den-

date for the senior membership,
while Paul Wilkesin is the candi-

The two men vieing for the
membership from the
