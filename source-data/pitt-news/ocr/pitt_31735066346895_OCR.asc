meet at Monday's ceremonies. The two maids on the viewing‘ end
of the procession look more at case but they may well feel less
comfortable than their gowned sisters when they realize the long‘
road of knowledge they have yet to travel.

110 Teachers Here

110 candidates for Peace Corps teaching assignments in
Liberia will train at the University from June 18 through
August 11.

The University was chosen because of its “reputation in
the field of international programs and the availability of,
its physical facilities and academic and intellectual resources,” i

A Taylor Address Graduates

Parents, relatives and friends of over 1200 graduates of

the University gathered on

the Cathedral lawn Monday

morning to witness the 1962 Commencement ceremonies.
Inspite of muted skies which threatened rain during the

morning and actually delivered it in the late afternoon, grad-

uation activities were held under the gold and white, medieval

jousting tent first used in
and abandoned last year because
of inclement weather.

Chancellor Litchfield addressed

the graduates and their audience’

on "The University‘s role in
World Af‘faii's." Too many Uni-
versities. the Chancellor said, are
not dedicated to “a substantive
involvement of their faculties in
issues beyond our national boun-
dunes."

In answer to this problem he
outlined a seven point program
which a general University coin-
mittee has drafted to innncrse the
University in (I “planned. dedi-

cated lll\'<!l\'t.‘lll("lll in world af-
fairs."
The (‘lianct-llor‘s address led

to an introduction of General
Maxwell 1). Taylor. former
Army (‘hicf of Staff and present
Military Representatives to the
President. General Taylor spoke
on "The Evolving Strategy of
National Security." pointing out
that military policy has swung
from the maintainance of retali-
atory wcapons forces to concen-
tration on task forces against
internal (‘ommunist subversion
in neutral or pro—western coun-
tries.

After‘ General Taylor's speech,
batchelors“. masters" and doctoral

.degrces were conferred on candi-

dates who completed their course
requirements in August or, De-

cember 1961 and April 1962.
Katherine McBride, Bishop John
Wright, Wendell Stanley and

General Taylor also received hon-
orary degrees.

according to Dr. Ryland W. Crary,
associate professor of Education,
and head of the project.

Other colleges, including Pen n
State, have already participated in
Peace Corps training programs.
“We develop our own program ac-
cording to areas of study indicated
by the Peace Corps," Dr. Crary
said. ’

Emphasizes Facts

He emphasized the fact that the
University's program will have a
new innovation: training will be
organized in tour tracks.

Some trainees will go into
secondary education, others into
elementary. Also, some have
had some teaching experience
while others have not.

C. Scott Kelley, assistant di-
rector of the Oﬁicc of Cultural
and Educational Exchange. is as-
sociate project director. “The fact
that English is spoken in Liberia
means that we can devote more
time to the technical aspects oi
teaching," he pointed out.
