Howard Heinz Will Present Chapel reshmen

To University at Sunday Services

Dr. Coffin
Will Give Talk

By E. SEYMOUR KERBER

Ruslied to completion during
the past week, the Heinz Memo-
rial chapel will be dedicated be-
fore a limited audience Sunday at

23 :30 0 ’clock.

Dr. Henry Sloane ('ofiin, presi-

dent of the Union Theological sem-

inary, will give the principal ad-
dress at the dedication.
Howard Heinz will present the

chapel to the University and Chan-
cellor John G. Bowman will give
the address of acceptance. Admis-
sion to the dedication will be by
invitation only, because of the lim-
ited seating capacity of the chapel.

Other speakers on the program of
dedication will be Dr. Stuart Nye
Hutchinson, pastor of the East Lib-
erty Presbyterian church, and Dr.
Hugh Thompson Kerr, pastor of the
Shadyside Presbyterian church and
a member of the University’s board
of trustees.

Music will be provided by Russell
Wichrnann, University organist, by a
choir comprised of the Shadyside
Presbyterian church quartet, and the
University chorus.

Symbol of spiritual growth, the
Heinz Memorial chapel was pre-
sented by the children of the late
Henry J. Heinz to be the home of
religious activity and worship for
the student body on campus, in
memory of their father and grand-
mother.

The chapel is the newest building
on the fourteen—acre plot, the Frick
Acres, which also includes the Ca-
thedral of Learning and the Stephen_
Foster Memorial. A bequest to the
University in the will of Henry J.
Heinz, who died in 1919, provided
for the erection of a memorial to his
mother, Anna Margaretta Heinz.
This gift was added to by Mr. Heinz’s
children, Mrs. John L. Given, of New
York City, the late Clifford Heinz,
and Howard Heinz, of Pittsburgh.

Designs for the Heinz _Memorial
chapel were made by the late Charles
Klauder, who was also the designer
of the Cathedral of Learning and
the Stephen Foster Memorial.

Mr. Klauder died last month in
Philadelphia. '

versity, to participate in personal
conferences with the faculty, and to
enjoy an informal social hour.

Freshman Athletes lSF A to Sound Out

Protest, Assessment

“What’s going on?” aI1 aroused
student body has‘ been asking around
the Commons Room these past’ few
days as an aggravated freshman
football situation reached somewhat
of a head and, accordingly, burst
into public scrutiny._

Last week notes in the semester's

$150, tuition were handed to fresh- .

man ath1etes._ These notes payable
were signedat the beginning of the
semester by the members of‘ the
yearling sports’ teams. , _

The athletes protested the assess-»
ment of these notes for two rea-
sons. First, they didn’t have the
money to pay for them. Second,
the boys didn’t realize what they
were signing at the time.

The reason that they didn’t have
the available funds was because the
jobs with which they are to earn
their board and tuition money do
not provide sufficient returns to
cover both. They earn only enough,

1‘ To determine administration atti-

lications, (3) building program, and
other pertinent problems an SFA
committee was appointed by John
Downie, BA39, president, at the
scheduled SFA meeting last Tues-
day evening. A
Although there was one less than
a quorum present, Downie, acting
on his prerogative, chose Ray Diiiilt,
M39; Mary Gregg, Ed49; Emil Taario,
D39; and Patricia Elmer,«C40, to help
compile the questions and to ’go
with him to administration officials
for answers to the questions.
' Initiative for the SFA action was
key-noted by Pat Cusick, E40, who
stated in the informal ‘meeting, “I
think the time has
come to ask a few
questions about
University poli-
cies.”
In the discus-
sion concerning
,the proposed ac-
tion, Jack Hoeve1-
er, C40, said, “We
have to go to the
downtown papers

unztersa, Medical om

Gradually Nears

Gradually, quietly,‘ almost without‘
their knowing it, citizens of Western
Pennsylvania have had growing -on
the University campus ..within. the
past two‘ decades one.of the nation's
greatest centers. of medical and sur-
gical research and treatment. For the
community this center means better

health" and ‘ longer life ‘for everyone.

For the origin of this medical cen-
ter, we may ,look back 20 years.
There was little‘ co-ordination'’ of
medical effort in Pittsburgh then.
And yet there was deﬁnite, obvious-
need for expansion of hospital facil-
ities. Looking ahead, medical men
and friends of the hospitals recog-
nized the need, and were considering
construction of new buildings or ad-
ditions to the existing ones.

But there was no central organiza-
tion to bring these projects into an
integrated program, and there was
the obvious prospect of duplicated
effort. Western Pennsylvania will
not soon forget the two men—Dr.
Ogden M. Edwards, Jr., and the late
Dr. Raleigh Russell Huggins—who
saw in this project for expansion of
hospital facilities the opportunity to
create a medical center for the com-
munity.

Dr. Edwards was then acting dean
of the School of Medicine of the
University and was chairman of the
medical committee of the Univer-
sity’s board of trustees. Dr. Hug-
gins was then associate professor
of gynecology in the School of
Medicine, and was destined with-
in a year to become its dean. To-
gether they planned for the medical
center. As they saw it, the center
should grow up around the School of-
Medicine. Soon after, Dr. John G.
Bowman came to"the University as

Completion}

V
chancellor, and he shared their hopes

and ‘gave -his help.

Brieﬂy, the idea was that the new
hospitals should be built in close
proximity; that. their administration
should be kep_t..jndependent;'but that
their efforts should ‘so co-ordinated,
and ..t_hat/they might serve the cause
of medical ‘education. In them, stu-
dents of medicine and of nursing
could observe methods of surgery and
medical treatment. '
_ The University purchased as a site
for this health center a full city
block, familiarly known as the H. K.
Porter estate, bound by Fifth Avenue,
Lothrop, Terrace, and De Soto Street,
south of the Pitt Stadium. Space was
set aside for each of the hospitals to
be built, and these sites were given
to the hospitals which wished to
build there.

In the years since, the University
Medical Center has grown. There is,
on De Soto Street, the Children’s
Hospital, with l.7O beds; the Presby-
terian Hospital, with 156 beds; the
Eye and Ear Hospital, with 101 beds;
the Falk Clinic, a diagnostic hospital.
Now being built, to the east of the
Presbyterian Hospital, is the Miller
Hospital (for women) with 146 beds.
And just across the street, at the in-
tersection of De Soto and O’Hara
Streets, is under construction the
Western State Psychiatric Hospital,
of the Commonwealth of Pennsyl-
vania, with 200 beds. Not many
blocks away is another unit of the
Medical Center, the adult department
of the Magee Hospital, with 287 beds.
Projected for future construction on
the Porter Plot are a nurses’ home,
a clinical laboratory, medical school
laboratories, two ward buildings, and

a private-room building.

Discussion questions will include:
Is there an after life? What can you

better than another? Why — the

Church? What will television do to

‘Because of large attendance at]

Phi Delts
Win Greek
Grid Title

By Bert Ja.ﬂ'e

Phi Delta Theta defeated Phi
Gamma Delta, 1-0, in a thrilling
match to win the Interfraternity
touchfootball championship.

Paul “Pee \Yee” Park earned
the right to have his picture
placed with such other Phi Delt
football heroes as Joe Donchess,
Warren Heller, and Harold Stebbins.
It was Pee Wee who snagged a
high pass out of the darkness on the
two-yard line to give his team the
victory by advancing the ball far-
thest into the opponent’s territory
after the completion of five plays
each in the overtime period.

BRUISING FOOTBALL

Forty minutes or bruising foot-
ball by both teams failed to produce
a score. Each team threatened, the
Phi Delts advancing as far as the
two—yard line before the half ended,
but neither team was able to put
across a touchdown.

The extra period was marred by
fumbles as darkness had set in be-
fore termination of the regular time.
Phi Delta Theta had the bal.l at mid-
ﬁeld to start the extra period. Park
fumbled and lost five yards. Phi
Gamma Delta was given the ball,
and Mitchell fumbled and lost 10
yards placing the ball in Phi Delta
Theta’s possession on the Phi Gam
27-yard line.

Cashdollar fumbled and this time
lost six yards putting the ball in the
Phi Delt’s territory. Edmund’s com-
pleted a pass to Eitel for a seven-
yard gain. Cashdollar fumbled for
the third consecutive Phi Delt bob-
ble but carried the ball to the line
of scrimmage for no gain.

PARK STARS

Dimit passed to Edmunds for a
ﬁve-yard gain. Park attempted a
long pass to Smith, but it was in-
complete. The Phi Gams played
safe, and Dimit carried the ball
through center for no gain.

This. was the set-up which ulti-
mately found Park the game’s hero.
Four plays h‘a’d been completed, and
only one remained for the Phi Delts.
They lined up in their regular for-
mation. Larry Smith was sent out
long to draw one of the two Phi
Gam safety men out of the way. Bob
Black and Park went long on the
opposite side of Smith.

Cashdollar faded back and heaved
a high pass into the dark sky. The
next thing anyone saw was Black
hugging Park. It MUST have been
"a spectacular catch. The Phi Gams
attempted a long pass on their ﬁnal
down, Edmunds to Mitchell, but
it failed.

Many exciting incidents dotted the
fracas. Phi Delta Theta kicked on
fourth down early in the game, and
the punt was blocked. Charley Dim-
it knocked the ball over the goal
line, and Sandy McLoed recovered
in the end zone for the Phi Delts.

REFEREE EXPLAINS

The game was held up for approxi-
mately five minutes while Referee
Ohl explained the ruling on the
play. The official decision was that
Dimit’s impetus forced the ball over
the goal line, and an automatic
touchback was declared. The Phi
Delts were awarded a free kick from
the 12-yard line.

Two of the outstanding features of
the game were the Phi Gam’s strong
defense inside their own 20-yard
line, and the punting of Bill Ed-
munds of the same team. On one
kick, Bill stood at the end of his end
zone, and booted the ball to the fence
at the other end of the ﬁeld, a dis-
tance of 80 yards.

PHI DELTS WIN

Congratulations to Phi Delta The-
ta, 1938 football champions of the
Interfraternity football league. They
came from behind no less than four
times in as many games to stay in
the running.

And while on the subject, con-
gratulations to Phi Gamma Delta, a
stout-hearted team who twice had
the championship within their grasp,
but lost it to the fighting champions.

Pitt Plays Penn State
In Final Home Game

By Bill Mazefsky

P e n 11 State ’s unpredictable
Lionmen visit the Stadium tomor-
row afternoon in the 38tl1 renewal
of a traditional series when the
Pitt Panthers answer the ﬁnal
whistle of the 1938 home season.
State, an up and down team all
season, carries a curious record into
the game, losing to the easy teams
and winning or tying the tough ones.
The Panthers move in with seven

wins racked up as against one loss.’

That old “delbbil,” mental atti-
tude, may play an important role in
the ﬁnal score. The famous Duke
line, which operates some 450 miles
to the South and which has with-

Mets Favored To Defeat N ewmansf

In Today’s Intramural Play-off

V

By BILL MCELWAIN
Newman Club and the Metallurgists battle today at 4 o’clock
to decide who will meet Phi Delta Theta in the intramural playoﬁs

ﬁnal on Monday.

Toda\"s game is the second meeting of the two clubs.
thumped the Newmans 15-0 last Tuesday as Mann, Leith. Reilly, and
Ashman ran the losers silly. Mann ’s 15 yard touchdown jaunt behind

vthen Smith and McLeod entered the

TOUGH OPPOSITION

-The Metallurgists were given more
opposition by the Phi Delts last Wed-
nesday, much more. Starting the
game with only seven men, the Phi
Delts fell behind 7-0 in 30 seconds
of play, but after two more men had
given them a full lineup, the frat
boys turned on the heat and won
13-7.

Mann’s pass to Malley on the ﬁrst
scrimmage play of the afternoon
went for a touchdown, and when
Ohl had taken Mann’s toss for the
extra point, the Mets led 7-0. The
Phi Delts came back with three min-
utes to play in the half as Park
heaved to Black in the end zone on
an ancient “sleeper” play. Todd
evened the score with a drop kick.

SMITH SCORES

With six minutes remaining in the
game, Cashdollar passed to Smith
who caught the ball on the Mets’
ﬁve»-yard line and went over with
the winning points. Park was tagged
on the three-yard marker to gum up
the extra point.

The Phi Delts kicked off to open
the game, and Ashman returned just
past midﬁeld to the Phi Delta Theta
28. Then came the Mets’ score,
Mann spotting Malley on the Phi
Delts 12, and lofting a high pass to
him on the touchdown. Mann found
Ohl open and bulleted the ball into
his arms for the seventh point.

After the Mets’ kickoff had gone
out of bounds and been returned to
the Phi Delts’ 20, Cashdollar quick
kicked over the Metallurgists’ goal
line. Underwood took a pass from
Mann for a ﬁrst down on the Mets’
21, but a penalty for too much time
in the huddle set the Mets back ﬁve
yards on the next play. Two passes
failed, and Mann kicked to Cashdol-
lar on the Phi Delt ﬁve—yard line.

game for the Phi Delts. On their ﬁrst
play with a full team, the Phi Delts
elected to kick, Mann taking Cash-
dollar’s high boot on the Metallurg-
ist 20. After three unsuccessful plays,
the Phi Delts had the ball on their
own 12 by means of a punt into the
end zone.

A pass, Cashdollar to Park, gained
four yards. but Underwood inter-
cepted on the Phi Delts’ 25 a play
later. The Mets drew a 15-yard
penalty for illegal blocking on the

next scrimmage, and although Mann

sent the Mets deep into their own

Black partially blocked the try, and
the ball rolled out of bounds on the
Metallurgists’ 27.

Park spotted Black with a short
pass just a yard short of a ﬁrst down,
and then made the distance with six
yards to spare by passing to Cash-
dollar. Another pass ﬂopped to the
ground, but Angel pulled in a toss
on the ﬁve on the next play.

The Phi Delts lined up hurriedly,
Black staying close to the sidelines.
Park took the snap, hesitated, then
threw to Black who caught the ball
over the goal with no one near him.
Art Todd, drop kick specialist, toed
the extra point, and the half ended
a few plays later.

On the kickoff to open the second
half, Angel lateralled to Smith who
was stopped on the Phi Delt 23. A
pass ﬁzzled, and then Cashdollar
booted short and out of bounds on
his own 26. When two consecutive
passes from Mann to Ohl put the
ball on the Phi Delt 11, it looked
like another Metallurgist score was
on the way, but Todd intercepted a
pass on his own two-yard marker to

Faking a pass, Park picked up sev-
en on a run. A reverse from Park;
to Cashdollar lost a yard, so Bernie’
kicked to Mann on Mets’ 16. A re— 
turn punt carried to the Phi Delts 19 2
from which point Cashdollar heaved
to Black for a ﬁrst down on the
Mets’ 26.

Ashman blocked the insuing pass,
but Cashdollar followed it up by ﬁr-
ing a long one to Smith on the Metal-
lurgist ﬁve. Larry caught the ball,
and eluded Ohl and Leith in the dash
for the goal.

The extra point play was a re-
verse, Park to Cashdollar, but the]
Mets stopped the play before Parkl
could get rid of the ball. From that 3
point on, the Phi Delts contented?
themselves with breaking up the !
Metallurgists’ passes, and freezing
the ball with running plays of their
own. -

From the looks of this result, it
seems mat the smart backing will
shift to the Greek champions. For-
merly, the Mets were selected as the
“lnmch” team.

Sentiment now naturally shifts to
the Park, Cashdollar, Smith band or.‘
happy gridders.

Listen to Me . 

By John Brosky, ’4Z

In the past six weeks, freshmen have been in strange
whirlpools, and only now are there evidences that the
fog is lifting and students are beginning to realize what
it’s all about.

The hardest task of a freshman is to get acquainted
with the University and the informal method by which
classes are carried on and taught. You rush to an 3:30
class at the University, take your respective seat, and
begin taking notes. The professor doesn't bid you
good morning; in fact he may not even look at you.
Time is money.

Day After Day

No one talks. The lecture isn’t interrupted. When
this class is ended, you hurry to Thaw Hall or Dental
Annex for the next class. And so on it goes, from
building to building. Day after day.

We came to the University for a purpose-—to receive
an education, to develop character and ideals, and to

become doctors, lawyers, teachers, etc. If we go to
class, that’s ﬁne. If we don’t that is still ﬁne. No one

v-..'or=.'lcs_. no one SCOldS you.

The driving force and compulsion prevalent in high
school are ob.'t.erat~ecl. The student is old -enougli to
make his own decisions say the professors, and if he
‘wants to learn he will ﬁnd a time andplz-.ce for study.

Too Easy At First

School was simple and easy the first two weeks. We
listened to lectures and had to read book assignments.
The professor never commented on the book, and 
1'e_acl the lessons only occasionally.

Since there was no studying‘ to do, we were more
frequent at-‘tea dances and house parties. Then came
the exams. The thumb of undone class work pressed
upon us a thinking grade. We blamed the professors
and their lecture methods. Now We blame «ourselves.

Activities Important

The University is a massive building, filled with nu-
merous oiﬁccs where students come and work all -jay
and then go home. Many students, -especially those that
commute, look at it thus. They represent no activities.

Consequently, there is no opportunity for character
and social development. These students may know
their ﬁeld of work and yet they might fail because they
will ﬁnd it. difﬁcult to act with people.

The mothers and fathers that assemble here ‘tonight
see rainbows of hope‘ for the dreams of thei* sons and
the happiness ofetheir daughters. _ I

FRIDAY. NOVEMBER 18, 1938

In The Mail

Editor, Pitt News.
Dear Sir:

Please note our surprise at the
about the Pitt and Tech football
teams. Consider some facts: every
team on the Pather ’38 schedule nat-
urally pointed for Pitt.

Pitt, in turn, pointed for Fordham
(everyone witnessing the Pitt-Ford-
ham game must have FELT the im-
pact of those two great teams whose
resulting casualties speak for them-
selves.) These facts, coupled with
the light schedule of the Tartans,
made the Tech victory inevitable.

Moreover, the Skibos suffered de-
feat when they were in better play-
ing condition than the Panthers when
defeated. Some question the score
of the Notre Dame-Tech game; but
,surely, if the Tech team were all it
:is supposed to be, it would have
ibrought that score up at least to a

tie.
In View of all this, the Tartans’

leap, in one game, from their former
status to being a ﬁrst-rate power
amazes us.

Tech Goal-Posts Taken

It was a case of “you take our goal posts, we’ll take yours.”
hockey goal posts now rest in the women’s locker rooms in Trees gymna-
sium. It was a fast and furious game of hockey that saw the Pitt girls on
top with a 2-0 score, over Tech. Melva Makrower scored the first goal by
drawing the goalie out, and scoring the ball over her stick. Betty Murphy
shifted to center forward and drove a hard fast ball for a second score, put-
ting the game on ice. The backs played an exceptionally fine defensive
game, which prevented Tech from even threatening to score.

THE PITT NEWS

Heinz Chapel Dedication

(Continued from Page One)
with the general Gothic style used
on all Frick Acres buildings.

French Gothic of the thirteenth
century is the style used. The chapel
is modeled after the famous Sainte
Chapelle in Paris. All lines on the
chapel tend upward, and seem to
elongate the building. High-pitched
vaults, pointed arches, and long thin
buttresses are used in creating this
effect. The chapel actually reaches
235 feet to the point of its tall spire.

This point is equivalent to nearly
half the height of the Cathedral.

GOTHIC STYLE

In the Gothic style, the transept,
nave, and chancel meet to form a
cross; the nave and chancel form
the vertical, the transept, the center
section of the chapel, the horizontal
portions of the cross. The roof of
the transept is 125 feet high, while
the roofs of the nave and chancel
are 100 feet high. Inside, the tran-
sept is 92 feet high and the nave
and chancel are 63 feet high.

The chapel is 146 feet long and
55 feet wide. Entirely lead coated
copper, the spire of the chapel is
built on a special steel framework.

Entire stonework construction of
the chapel, both inside and outside,
is of gray Indiana limestone. Acous-
tical tile is used in the construction
of the interior ceiling, which is sup-
ported by st-one ribs. Floors of the
chancel and the aisles are of crab
orchard stone.

AMERICAN OAK

American oak is used in the pews
and the vestibule woodwork. Spe-
cially imported English pollard oak,
carved with traditional symbols and
tracery is used for the remaining
interior woodwork.

An Aeolian-Skinner organ has
been installed in the chapel. The
console of this organ is in the chan-
cel, while the pipes are concealed
by the triforium gallery around the
chancel

The union of education and re-
ligion is symbolized by the Heinz
Memorial chapel. This union is de-
picted on 69 stone shields on the
outside of the chapel. Sixty of these
shields bear the coat of arms of the
oldest American and foreign univer-
sities. The seven shields around the
main portal are religious shields.

Over the main portal are the coats

and the new University seal, adopt-
ed last year, a lighted candle, sym-
bolizing the light of education, at
the junction of three rivers, the Al-
legheny, the Monongahela, and the
Ohio. ,

Religious shields include four
bearing the symbols of the apostles:
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
Above these shields at the entrance
is a carved plaque bearing “The
Lamb Triumphant,” insignia of
Christ the Redeemer. Below the
apostles’ shields are the symbols of
the church fathers: crossed keys, for
Peter, and crossed swords, for Paul.

SHIELDS OF ARTS

Inside the chapel are other seals,
many of an ecclesiastical nature.
Shields showing the fourteen beati-
tudes of the soul are under the win-
dows having the themes wisdom and
justice. Seven shields showing the}
liberal arts are in the nave; seven
showing the crafts and trades. These
depict grammar, dialectic, rhetoric,
arithmetic, astronomy, music, ge-
ometry, medicine, alchemy, agricul-
ture, painting, metallurgy, architec-
ture, and glasswork.

Stained glass windows, designed
and executed by Dr. Charles J. Con-

nick in Boston, are, perhaps, the
most glorious part of the Heinz

chapel construction. These 23 win-
dows graphically relate the story of
life as a spiritual adventure through
Christian teaching. Each window is
a separate chapter in the story of
Christian teaching. I
MEMORIAL WINDOW

The window arrangements of the
chapel starts in the chancel, where
five windows show Christ as the
teacher of the five great virtues:
faith, hope, charity, justice, and wis-
dom.

On opposite sides of the chapel,
forward from the chancel, are two
choir windows which show the his-
tory and significance of music in
Christian worship. A small window,
which has for its theme, “Life as a
Spiritual Adventure,” is below the
choir window on the right. This
window is a special memorial win-
dow in honor of Henry J. Heinz,
and was presented by his grand-
children

lthe chapel, depict the men and
lwomen who through the ages have
exemplified true Christianity in
their characters. The windows, two
on each side, have as their themes:
courage, temperance, truth, and tol-
erance.

Two aisle windows in the nave
illustrate familiar Christian songs of
praise; two nave clear story win-
dows show the Christian teachers
from the third through the nine-
teenth. centuries.

In the narthex, above the entrance
to the chapel, are three large win-
dows illustrating the three Chris-
tian literary masterpieces, “Canticle
of the Sun,” by St. Francis; “Pil-
grim’s Progress," by John Bunyan;
and “The Holy Grail,” from Mal-
ory’s “Le Morte d’Arthur.”

Conventional Gothic floral designs
are contained in the remainder of

the small windows about the chapel
corridors.

ghave an opportunity to learn the
§Eng1ish language and to see what
;life on the earth in 1938 was like.
2 At the suggestion of Dr. Jotham
§Johnson. instructor in classics, the
itime capsule contains microfilmed
icopies of books containing a portion
iof the Holy Bible in close to 1,000
5languages and dialects of today. This
iwill help the people of the seven-
tieth century to decipher the books
contained in the Cupaloy capsule.

Dr. Johnson explained that there
is no way of determining which
felanguage of today will dominate
5,000 years from now. At present
English, Spanish, Chinese, and
French are the dominant languages
of the earth. Perhaps Russian, Jap-
anese, Greek, or Turkish may sur-
Qvive where other languages will die
?out. . = - .

Very little space in the capsule
was devoted to actual objects. Only
,two full-sized books were included:
Ea Holy Bible and the Book of Rec-
ford of the Time Capsule. Micro-
ifilmed equivalents of 70 volumes are

;included in the seven foot glass cyl-

inder enclosed in the outer shell of ‘A

.‘ Cupaloy. I -
} Among the actual objects are a
pipe, some cigarettes, a can opener,
poker chips. a woman’s hat, and a
,slide rule with instructions. Three
Elllllslctll numbers are included: “The
istars and Stripes Forever,” “Fin-
jandia.” and “Flat Foot Floogie.”
i Copies of several American maga-
izines and newspapers and portions
iof an encyclopedia are reproduced
on microfilm. Stress was placed on
showing how to build common ob-
jects of today. Directions for build-
ing dynamos, motion picture projec-
tors and other objects were included
in the capsule. Three newsreels were
included to show scenes from ev-
eryday life.

The fifty-page Book of Record is
printed on a special run of rag pa-
per chosen for its permanence. Fred-
e;ic W. Gouly set up the type by
hand in one of his own type faces.
Samples of actual type and a lino-
type slug are to be found in the
capsule.

A key to the English language is
contained in the book. The thou-
sand most-used words are given in
the phonetic alphabet as Well as in

ordinary type and a few of the most

At high noon on September 23,
1938, the exact time of the Autumnal
Equinox, the time capsule was bur-
ied 50 feet under the site of the

Westinghouse pavilion at the New
York World’s Fair.
Instructions for determining the

position of the capsule through as-
tronomical and geodetic calculations
are included in the Book of Record.

matters had been considered by the
body.

First matter considered was the
CWEN-SFA combined student direc-
tozy, which will go on sale Novem-
ber 28 for 25 cents.

Plans for the sale of at least 1,000
copies are being made- .

Gertrude Broido, C39, brought up
the problem of a place to put books
in the Tuck shop, which according
to Hoeveler, “is down in the cellar.”
Miss Broido wanted “provision for
books in the Tuck shop.”

Downie summarized with, “We
need a new Tuck shop, not a place
for books.”

Theodore M. Biddle, assistant to
the dean, of men, informed members
that the little money made by the
Tuck shop-is being turned into equip-
ment.

Dean Lanfear was the only other
faculty member at the meeting.

From the Tuck shop discussion, the
talk veered to the “we want to
know” part of the meeting.

The meeting concluded with the
request to place the chess team,
which received an SFA charter last
year, on the athletic program. Downie
stated, “As far as the chess team is
concerned, that’s a matter they’ll
have to take up with the athletic de-
partment.”

Dr. James B. Stinchcomb, associ-
ate professor of classics and editor
of the Classical Weekly, will attend
the meeting of the Classical Associa-
tion of the Atlantic States at Atlan-
tic City on November 26. He will

ilialecki Claims Polish History

Freshman Athletes
Protest Assessment

working every day, to take care of
their room and board.

In the second place, when the
notes were signed the first-year ath-
letes were under a wide-spread im-
pression that there was nothing to
them. _ It was regarded, by the boys,
as a “mere formality.” The notes
were signed in the presence of Wal-
ter I. Good, assistant athletic di-
rector.

With these things in mind, the
athletes, chiefly members of the
freshman football team, took their
case to James Hagan, athletic di-
rector. When informed that Hagan
was out of the city, they went in a
body to John Weber, business man-
ager and secretary of the Univer-
sity.

_-The conference with Weber re-
sulted in his promise to “look into
the case” and make a decision im-
mediately after Thanksgiving. At a
meeting of their own, the freshman
football players agreed to do nothing
until completion of the gridiron sea-
son.

Athletic Director Hagan returned
to the city yesterday. "‘I know
nothing about this situation,” he
said. “It is under the jurisdiction
of the treasurer’s office. Under our
new athletic code (known publicly
as the Bowman code) we do not
give athletic scholarships.

“This situation is caused by a mis-
interpretation of the code. We have
no other course to take but to follow
the rules of our new code.”

Dr. Elsbree Joins
History Department

Dr. Oliver VV. Elsbree, associate
professor of history and political sci-
ence, has been added to the staff of
the history department. He former-
ly was assistant professor of polit-
ical science at the Junior college in
Erie.

Dr. Elsbree has written articles in
the New England Quarterly and at
the present time "is working on a
book which will be a discussion on
the culture of America between
1775 and 1850.” It will be entitled
“Growth of Humane Spirit in Amer-
icaa.”

Divided into Four Main Epochs

By LEONARD GLASSNER

The history of Poland is divided
into four main epochs, according to
Professor Oscar Halecki who_spoke
on “The “Historical Integrity and
Continuity of Poland,” at Foster
Memorial last Wednesday night.

Professor Halecki, rated as one of
the outstanding contemporary Euro-
pean historians, has been a guest of
the University for the last few days.
He has been a member of the League
of Nations, and is active on many
educational boards in several Euro-
pean countries.

In his lecture, Professor Halecki

traced the history of Poland and her
people from their beginning in the
tenth century to the present day.
Three of the eras have occurred be-
fore the eighteenth century parti-
tions, and one since.

“From Poland’s adoption of Chris-
tianity in 966 to its complete uniﬁ-
cation in 1386 constitutes the ﬁrst
period. This later date is considered
the most important date in Polish
history,” said Professor Halecki, “for
it marks the beginning of that coun-
try as a world power.”

The second period extends from
1386 to 1572. and the third from 1572
to about 1790, the time of the parti-
tions.

Professor Halecki stressed partic-
ularly the fact that Polish traditions
were too deeply rooted in the hearts
of her people to be destroyed at the
late date of the partitions. There-
fore, although Poland did not appear
politically until after the World War,
the cultural continuity remained un-
disturbed throughout the interim.

Professor Halecki, in his lecture,
expressed satisfaction with the Polish
nationality room in the Cathedral
soon to be completed.
