System Unsound

The theory bf the revision corn‘-

the number of one’s quality points.

The present quality point system

"grants three points for an “A;” two

points for each credit of “B;” one
-for each “C,’? grade credit; zero for
each “D,” and minus two for ev-
ery «F.»

This system was patterned after
that of an eastern school without

* consideration of its applicability to
‘the ~ University of 'Pittsburgh- ‘as an _ _
ment of the cast_.selection. Thegcast

peculiar institution. Since a, stu-
dent’s general quality point rating
is decided by dividing the number
if credits earned by the number of
quality points received itis not un-
usual for a student to pass = twelve
credits with a negative quality.
Study Other Systems

To eliminate such an undesirable
condition an “F” would have some
positive point value-, and the gap.
between “F” and “DP and “B”
and “A” would be widened. Three
systems in use at other universities
are examples. , p
, Columbia College ’ gives the
weights of 1, 4, 7, 10, 14, to the

I Successive grades of «Aw» uB’u «C,»

“D,”. and “F.” Another school's
respective weights are 1, 4, 6, 8, _11.
A third system is 1, 4,5, 6, 9. Thus
the mark of “A” which is so seldom.
earned achieves a. high relative
value in comparison with the lower
grades. - _ B '

Braddock again led _' his - team in _

scoring,’ ringing up ten points. Pat-

Ma_hon,' Roux, ~'l‘-ormey, «Carney and
Braddock were the boys copping. the -

garland, while Foote, Bath, Weaver
and Coe were, upset. ,

Then the S. A. ‘E."s hunga wreath
onj-their S. A..~M.’s- collective chin
23-5+ ‘after’ the‘ Sammies had‘ nosed»
out lastv‘year’s champs by one point.‘
No 'h,ig‘h%‘—scorers' were ‘in the ‘win-
ning lineup; allthe boys playing? a

di‘-game of basketball. V kﬂowever,
rwin and Bengston had four each;
Barniker accounted-for three of his

Zeigler and Walinchus did dutyfor
the S. A. E.’s. P..Lewis, Alpern,
Parsky and Gladstone lost. —
The-’ wild running . Pi

points /-with four. ‘J. Rosenberg,
Jacobs, Jaffe again upheld the Pi
Lams’- side‘ of. the argument, with
Dimeo, Statti, Cellio, ‘De Giacomo,
Cfentrone and_ Colloco working for

_the Italians. Statti also had four

tallies. ,

all. saw service forthe victors. For

‘the losers AC. Rogers tallied. ten

points. and. 'D. ,Rogers pushed him
with _eight.,._vTheir teammates were

_Glas"sl_)o.urne, Rankin and Neal}.

The secondgame of that evening
saw the '-Sigma Pis cop. theirstart
from Theta Kappa, Nu, 35-20. Baur,
collected twenty for the-winners and
Keller corralled eleven. Kinny, Cloe;
and .~Hutton shared the fruits of suc-

The. next scrap lwas between;
Lambda Chi. Alpha -and Phi Delta-

With..Kostecki getting ﬁfteen alone
there "could" be but one ending.
Ro.Inig,' Shipman, Mill_er, Thomas,

rest, of the class for the conquerors.
