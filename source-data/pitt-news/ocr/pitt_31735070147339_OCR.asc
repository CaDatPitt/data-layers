Pitt denies rumors of new head coach hiring’

Lauren Ki-rscihman
Assistant News Editor

Pitt denied rumors late last night
that it hired Penn State defensive
coordinator Tom Bradley as its
new head football coach.

“The University of Pittsburgh

ha s not offered its head coaching
position to anyone,” spokesman
E.]. Borghetti said in a statement,
“and no decisions about an offer
have been made.” .
Rumors that Pitt offered Brad-

ley the position circulated after-

WTAE reported last night that
Pitt had hired Bradley.

I moi; .

Borghetti did not say in his

statement whether Bradley or I

University of Alabama assistant
head coach Sal Sunseri were
interviewed for the position,
as some news outletsreported}
Borghetti could not be reached
for additional comment. '

Alex Oltmanns

While the outside world has been-»

quick to ‘criticize —— and some-
times condemn —-‘ those at the
helm of Pitt football, four recent
players expressed far more un-
derstanding.

“Chancellor Nordenberg,
I couldn’t ﬁnd a guy I respect
more than him,” said Yogi Roth,
a former ‘Panthers receiver who
graduated in 2004. “[Athletic
Director] Steve Pederson right
now is being unjustly criticized.
He got put intoa reallyibad sce-
nario.”

Alumni and Pitt fans have
questioned Pederson,» Norden-
berg and the way they chose to
hire and ﬁre Michael Haywood,
who served as head football
coach for about two weeks be-
fore being arrested on a domestic
battery charge and fired. Hay-
wood pleaded not guilty earlier
this week.

Recent alumni were more re-
luctant to judge Pederson and
Nordenberg, pointing to the
many outside inﬂuences that
can impact a decision to hire or
fire a coach and to their own ex-
periences working with the two
men. V

Roth —— who has since worked
as an assistant coach at the Uni-

No more ‘epic fails’.

Students, faculty reflect on the overused words of 2010

Shae’ Felicien
Staff Writer

With a new year, it’s time to “man up,” rid
yourself of all those “epic fails” and “live.
life to the fullest.” And according to Lake
Superior State University, it’s also time to
shape up that vocabulary.

The university; condemned 14 new words
with the release of its “36th Annual’ List of
Words Banished from the Queen’s English

504:

for Mis—Use, Over4Use and General Use-
lessness.” Each year hundreds of words are

nominated over the Internet to be marked ’

for doom, yet only the most overly used or
cliché make the list. -

This year “viral,” as in the rapid spread
of Internet content, topped the list. Despite
this, Linguistics Department Chair Scott
Kiesling thinks thatit will be added to the
dictionary in its current meaning.

The list of banished words reveals’ the

Hundreds of words

Banished 1 2

ever—changing nature of language, Kies-
ling said.

Kiesling said that although we tend to
think of dictionaries as static they often
adapt along with culture. He pointed out
that Shakespeare made up many words
which we use today. '

Kiesling also noted that the use of clichés
allow for simplicity and the avoidance of
complex explanations.

“If you use a cliché it is very useful be-
cause everyone knows what you’re saying,
it’s like using a well-known word. If you use
an obscure word that no one knows people
don’t understand you,” Kiesling said.

The words “epic” and “fail” took the No.
2 and 3 spots on this year’s list.

One nominator of the word fail stated

on Lake Superior’s website, “Whether it is ,

someone tripping, a car accident, a cos-
tumed character scaring the living daylights
out a kid, or just a poor choice in fashion,
these people drive me crazy thinking that
anything that is a mistake is a ‘fail.’ They
fail proper language!”

Visitors of the websiteused playful
personiﬁcation in nominating their most
irritating" usages. '

“Standards for using ‘epic’ are so low,
even ‘awesome’ is embarrassed,” said Mike

, of Kettering, Ohio, in.his online submission

nominating the word.

Clichés —— “Live life to the fullest,” “wow
factor” and “a—ha moment” — also made
the list alongside the Palin—derived “refudi—
ate” and “mama grizzlies.” And for those
who use Facebook or Google as verbs, the
list called for a change in their vocabulary
as -well.

“Facebooklis a great, addicting website.
Google is a great search engine, However,
their use as verbs causes some deep prob-
lems. As bad as they are, the trend can only
get worse, i.e., ‘I’m going to Twitter a few
people, then Yahoo the movie listings and
maybe Amazon a book or two,” said nomi-

nator Jordan of Waterloo, Ontario, in an »

online posting of the list.

Pitt sophomore Chidi Agu preferred to
endure the exhausted phrases over the talk
of why they shouldbe banished. _

“I would much rather hear a few phrases
used to death than listen to pseudo—intel-
lectuals constantly whine and type out the-
saurus-aided rants about how these words
will be the downfall of language as we know
it,” the sophomore said.

Some Pitt students disagreed with some
of the rankings.

“I think it’s pretty funny, but a few of
the words seem either outdated or wrongly
placed. 1 don’t know anyone that frequently,
or even occasionally, uses the phrase ‘wow
factor,”’ sophomore Anna Delaney said.

Some thou

ght the word “like” should be

added to the list. The word made its way
onto the 1997 list of banished words.

“I would thoroughly enjoy seeing the
overuse of the word ‘like’ banished,” Agu
said; “Because, like, when, like, every, like,

sentence someone says is, like, peppered _

with ‘like,’ like, I can, like, hardly stand
to listen to them, like, speak. Like, you
know?” I

Fralic said that he is likely to stop donating

donors understand, however, the University

' couldneverletcontributions ofanysizebeused p
to target any of its employees, whether they are
workinginacademicsorathleticsorsomeother ‘

area of the institution.” -
When called, Hill declined to give further
comment about Pederson. '

A Since news of new coach Michael Haywood’s
arrest broke, sports commentators and Pitt
alurrmi have questioned whether bad blood
might be brewing between Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg and Pederson. Some place much of

' the blame for the recentfootball troubles almost

solely on Pederson.
. But in a statement issued by the athletic

department earlier this week Borghetti said, '

“Steve Pederson has played akey role in elevating

_ Pitt’sathleticsprograms,remainsanirnportant

member of the University’s senior leadership
team and continues to enjoy theﬁill support of

p the chancellor.”

‘ Fralic and Helsel have not been the only Pitt
alumni to question Pederson and other Pit of-
ﬁcials following Haywood’s arrest onadomestic
battery charge and subsequent ﬁring. Pitt gradu-
ate and longtime New York Times sports writer
Murray Chass strongly questioned Pederson
earlier this week.

Helsel, who reached out to The Pitt News
yesterday, also said he is likely to stop donating
to the University if Pederson maintains his role
asathletic director. ‘

“I’mnotamultimillion-dollarldonor, butI’ve .

given the University a lot of money in my years
with no strings attached, and I don’t know if that
will continue,” Helsel said. “I’ve been in touch
with some of the biggest names in Pitt football
history, and there is serious concern.” ' _
Helsel is also likely to stop purchasing his

football and basketball season tickets‘ if Ped-

erson remains at Pitt. He said that he is deeply
co_ncemed for the University, and that “there
are some very signiﬁcant people who have made
signiﬁcant pledges to the University such thatif
Pederson stays, they won’t’ be ﬁilﬁlled.”
“Respectability and rebuildingthe University

isveryirnportantwiththese donations,”Helsel 

said. “Even academics who say that sports don’t

Haywood had been arrested for domestic bat-

‘_'liiat guy’ syndromeopollutes high court

0 matter how hard a so-

ciety tries to shake off a‘

backward practice or way

of thinking, if the effort ends suc-

cessfully, you can always count on
someone to be “that guy.” .

The infamous iconoclast is

faithfully on hold to, whenever it

can get the most publicity, cramp

the style of societal progress. '
The unsuccessful 1948 presi-
dential candidate James Strom
Thurmond — who ran under the
unpopular States’ Rights Demo-

. cratic Party and later fought

against the 1964 Civil Rights Act
—— was an example of “that guy.”
He defended his ﬁrmly rooted seg-
regationist position well into.the

1970s, long after such thinking
‘had been widely abandoned.

Today we ﬁnd ourselves in a
different social context, buteven

. among a new slew of social issues

people can, and commonly do, don
the mask of “that guy.”
Particularly regarding the top-
ic of discrimination against the
LGBT community, U.S. Supreme
Court justice Antonin Scalia re-
cently demonstrated “that guy”
behaviors, which outraged wom-
en’s rights activists and various
members of the media.

In an interview with Califor-.''

nia Lawyer Magazine published
earlier this week, Scalia rejected
the widely agreed-upon idea that
the 14th Amendment protects
women, gays and lesbians from
discrimination.

“Certainly the Constitution
does not require discrimination
on the basis of sex. The only=is—
sue is whether it prohibitsit. It
doesn’t. Nobody ever thought that

that’s what it meant. Nobody ever
voted for that,” he said in the in-
terview.

Scalia’s controversial state-
ments come at the heels of one of
the most important triumphs for
equal rights in decades, the repeal
of “Don’t Ask Don’t Tell,” the Clin-
ton—era law that forced gay and
lesbian members of the military
to keep their sexual orientation
secret, lest they face dismissal.

In a rare Saturday session on
Dec. 18, backed by 67 percent of
the nation, 63 senators voted to
allow gays and lesbians to openly
serve in the military for the ﬁrst
time in U.S. history. Some called
the historic moment akin to when
the military was racially desegre-
gated in the 1950s.

So you can understandwhy, un-
der these circumstances, so many

are aiming their vitriol at Scalia.

Vitriol aside, if all you care
about is bare-bones technicalities,
Scalia’s point is not unfounded —
the 14th Amendment hasn’t al-
ways been interpreted to prohibit
sexual discrimination.

For proof, you can look up A
the 1873 Bradwell v. Illinois case
when the Supreme Court denied a
woman a law degree so she would
instead fulﬁll her “noble” office of
motherhood.

However, four decades of ju-
dicial precedent clearly disagree
with Scalia. Ever since the 1971
Reed v. Reed case, “the Court has
repeatedly recognized that neither
federal nor state government acts
compatibly with the equal pro-
tection principle when a law or
official policy denies to women,
simply because they are women,

full citizenship stature,” Justice

Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in I

1996.

But instead of calling for Sca-
lia’sresignation or impeachment
and injecting the blogosphere with
ﬂoods of rage — note: “that guy’s”
behavior generally gets even worse
with that kind of attention — peo-
ple actually interested in ending
inequality would best devote their
energies to other efforts.

It’s surely scary that a man
with a lifetime supply of judicial
power can have such an antiquated
view on discrimination. But given
how Scalia is largely alone among
his fellow justices in this view,
campaigning for presidents who
appoint justices with views that
better reﬂect the times should be
a larger priority than going after
a single sitting “that guy.” I

Future planning not city’s strong suit,

Brown 4 5 ~

there were times when I wondered if the
city would ever dig out Oakland.

To compensate for the extra costs as-
sociated with plowing and salting the
city, Mayor Luke Ravenstahl petitioned
the state through the Federal Emergency
Management Agency — the wonderful
organization that so promptly cleaned New
Orleans in the wake of 2ooV5’s Hurricane
Katrina — for emergency funds.

Fast forward to May, and City Council
was still grilling civil servants on what
they could have done better toprevent
the city’s snow blunders. A

It was a noble afterthought to make the
city’s politicians lookalike they cared. Good
forthem. What they shouldghave done,

howev'er,—was give the whole matter a little _ .
more foresight. Fortunately forthis year, V ‘
at 1eastPitts‘burgh has issued imailingsgwith ,
emergency snow weather plans to apart-A

ments and homes around the city.

stall tactics to put up more debt to keep
the old pension liabilities aﬂoat." »

It is a practice that dates back to 1998,
when the city retired $66 million of debt
just to simultaneously issue ﬁve new mu-

nicipal bonds totaling $403.8 million, ac? ' A

cording to the Tribune Review."
This city prides itself with living on
half—cocked plans, its officials looking

the part in suits and ties, but really never,

grasping the true meaning of the tasks at
hand, much less a semblance of planning
in advance. It’s not so much an individual

issue as it is a mentality issue, as several
of the faces have changed over the years,
but the mindsets haven’t.. A
During the last hours of 2010, the coun-
cil passed a resolution, which would real-

locate $736 million in parking taxes to the ‘

pension fund over the next 31 years —~
another stopgap rather than a ﬁx. F_or the

' plan to work, Ravenstahl and the council
must also cut $13 million in spending —‘

which is something th_ey’ve'_never been

i good at doing. _ _
With recent infighting between this ,
city’s politicians, it ought to be interesting -

to see how they handle the city’s funding
together. Whether something aslseemingly

6 simple as snow or as complex as ensuring

financial stability for future leaders of this

city, they’ve demonstrated little in the

way of real skill at knowing what’s best
for Pittsburgh. }

Despite our snow disaster becoming a
memory left behind in 2010, I predict the
forecast to remain the same — showers of

‘ heavy snow at times surrounded by consis-
tent storms of legislative incompetence.

Joel Lindsey would never have
moved to Pittsburgh or formed his
local band Boulevard of the Allies
were it not for one Beaver County
woman. .

Lindsey, who will perform solo
and with his band in the Steel City

-areathis month, met his wife, Amy in

a bar in his hometown of London.
The ﬁrst time they met, Lindsey
faked an American accent. The next
time the two met he used his actual
British accent and Amy called him
out on it. After he explained his up-

bringingwith an American mother .
J and British father, Amy said she was

charmed.
“For whatever_ reason, that en-
deared him to me and I fell in love

 all based on a lie that he had an

American accent,” she said.
But the cost of living in Lon-

don was expensive so Lindsey, a .
' Duquesne graduate, suggested they

relocate to Pittsburgh.

_ Lindsey agreed to move, explain-
ing that his band in London “wasn’t
taking it seriously then” and he didn’t

mind achange because there “wasn’t -

a way to make money and work ﬁill

time.” However, he had some stipu-

lations about the change.
“[London] is like New York,

there’s just so many more musi-.

cians and so many more venues,”
Amy Lindsey said.

“The funny thing was Joel didn’t
know anything about Pittsburgh. He
said ‘I’ll go for six months. I won’t
stay any longer than six months.’...
It’s been like three and a half years,
and we justboughtahouse. So I don’t
think we’re leaving,” Amy Lindsey
said.

4‘ Once in America, Lindsey began
a solo career, traveling the country
from Washington, D.C., to San Fran-
cisco. Before his tour, he explored the
Pittsburgh music scene and found he
enjoyed playing in the city.

“There’s something cool about
Pittsburgh,” he said. “[My wife and
I] soon realized we wanted to stay
in Pittsburgh for a while. I got re-
ally involved with the music scene.
People want to collaborate, and it’s

' laid back. I recognized how good the

talent is here.”

MOVIE ‘REVIEW 

Coppola’s minimalism can‘ beodd for I new viewers-

.“Som-ewhe're” is full of tenuously connected scenes to draw the audience’s attention to theoverall message of the film

Kayla Sweeney

Staﬁ‘ Writer

“Somewhere” 1 _ it ~ _
Directed by: Sofia Coppola
Starring: Stephen Dorff, Elle

' Fanning
‘ Grade: B+

In fairy tales of old, beautiful
princesses were often locked
away in castles and relied on
princes to come save them.
Soﬁa Coppola spins this idea
in “Somewhere,” the tale of an
attractive actor self—_imprisoned

in a luxury hotel who relies on
his 11-year-old daughter to help
him escape. But in this case,
dragons don’t block the exits
— beautiful, arid usuallynaked,

. women do.

In the Chateau Marmont, a
luxurious Hollywood hotel, we
find complacentactor Johnny
Marco (Stephen Dorff). He
dresses like a teenager, smokes’
a lot and has sex with the numer-
ous blond women who stalk the
halls of the Marmont, in between
promoting his new movie. His
easygoing cycle of a lifestyle is

broken when his daughter, Cleo
(Elle Fanning), arrives to live
with him for an indeterminate
amount of time. . V
What follows is 90 blissful
minutes of Johnny and Cleo
bonding over Guitar Hero, ping-
pong and underwater tea par-

‘ties with minimal dialogue and

maximal emotion.Johnny begins
to question his life and where it
is going. '
Coppola achieves the remark-
able feat of both allowing the au-
dience to wish to beJohnny and
live his easy life, while simulta-

\

neously showing his l_oneliness
and boredom with his situation
— his ennui. Dorff does an ex-
cellent job conveying an aston-
ishing amount of emotion with
little’ speech.

Viewers who are not used to
Coppola’s films might be sur-
prised at how much doesn’t hap-
pen in “Somewhere,” and how
even the previously described
plot is paper thin, barely even
holding the events of “Some-
where” together.

Coppola’s movies are about
minimalism, but “Somewhere”

takes it to new extremes. Bur-

ied deep in the minimalism is 12
' an important message about

the nature of Hollywood and
the truth about what it really
means to be a celebrity: You get
everything you want but the cost
might leave you in solitude.

Fanning is charming enough A

to create a breath of fresh air
when she is on screen. When
Johnny’s quiet antics become
boring, Fanning’s character re-
turns to the screen and pulls the

audience back in. -~

Together, they portray a fa-

to make it in the music scene in Pittsburgh,
he said. . l .

‘ “Pittsburgh isn’t known for its music scene,
but there was an opportunity to do something
here,” he said. “I quickly got myselfa lot of
gigs. I’m a busy musician and make a living
doingi ” '

“There’s a higher ratio of really good talent
here,” Amy Lindsey said. a ,

“I think it was a struggle at ﬁrst but he
quickly met, dare I say, even better musicians
or at least different kinds of musicians  that
gave him a new direction  I think it inspired
some of his best songs,” Amy Lindsey said.

Oddly though, the acoustic-rock band
rarely performs as a whole.

“It varies,” Lindsey said on the band’s per-
formances. “I work professionally as a musi-
cian in Pittsburgh. I get gigs all over the place
from Beaver to New York City. ,I play a lot of

1 solo shows. Originally the group was atrio, but ’

we expanded to record an album. We made it
aﬁve-piece for.tha .”

Lindsey believes the group’s energetic
performances and “unique soulful sound”

are what attracts a large demographic to the
band and allows it to exist even if they rarely
perform.

But whereas he’s been fortunate enough to '

make his living performing, Lindsey will read-
ily admit it wasn’t easy gaining his status.
“It’s difﬁcult to know where peopleare in
this city,” he said, citing culture differences as‘
an issue. “In London a student union is a place
where_students go to listen to music. Here a
student union doesn’t seem to be a place for

h a band. For someone who didn’t live here and

study here, it’s hard to know how to appeal to
younger people. Ithink our success comes from
playing in so many different places.” '
Kurasch plans to stay with engineering and
will enjoy being in the band, but he can see a
potentially bigger ﬁiture. _ ‘
“]oel.a___nd I promote Boulevard as much as
we can,” he said. “We’re in love with the band
and would love it to take off. That’s what one
‘everyone hopes for. As much as I love engineer-
ing, it’s hard to compete with something like
music. There’s no job better. If record deals ﬂy
our way, the choice is pretty obvious.”  ‘

For Roth, Lee and former linebacker
Adam Gunn the switch to hire Haywood was
made by highly qualiﬁed people — includ-
ing Pederson — who later also made the
best decision they could given the allega-
tions against Haywood.

“I have a perfectly great relationship

with Chancellor Nordenberg, Mr. Pederson '

and Coach Wannstedt,”_Gunn‘said. “That
situation, it’s tough. It was out of a lot of

- people’s hands.”

Lee believes‘ the University made the
right move when it ﬁred Haywood. When

a person is accused of a crime, people tend ‘

V to View him as guilty even if he hasn’t been
convicted, he said. P ’
“Chancellor Nordenbérg is one of the
best guys I’ve ever met inrmy life and Peder-
son is too,” Lee said. “I know they wouldn’t-

mekea decision and bring someone in

that they thought would be like "that, so ’

I’m assuming Haywood was not that kind
of person, just got caught up in the wrong
situation.” A

The University might be going through
a public relations crisis right now, but for
proud Pitt football alumni like Roth, who
have since left Pittsburgh, it’s easy to trust
the people thousands of miles away who are
making the decisions.

“I know the kind of guy that Chancel-
lor Nordenberg is, the kind of guy that
Steve Pederson is, .the kind of person that
[Director of Football Operations] Chris

LaSala and [Director of Media Relations] '
