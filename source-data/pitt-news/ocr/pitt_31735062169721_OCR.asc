Interrupts Debate

by SHERI ZIPPAY
Staff Coordinating Editor

The first debate between Inde-
pendent S t umd e n t Association
(ISA) Student Government presi-
dential candidate Scott Baum and
the Students Toward Progress
(STP) candidate Steve O’Neill
was interruptedseveral times by
disqualified presidential hope-
ful- Marc Simon, representing the
Freedom and Radical Conserva-
tive Elements (FARCE) party.

We Must Utilize the
Student Body,»

The debate, held in Tower C
Lobby, opened with a presenta-
tion by Scott Baum (ISA) Stating
that .“the role of SG is not inno-
vative but reflective and respon-
sive to student opinion."

Baum went on to say that SG
must become “a mouthpiece, not
a decision maker. Legislative pro-
cedures must be given to the stu-
dents in special meetings, mak-
ing SG a participatory govern-
mcnt.”

He proposed that SG create an
Appointments Committee to “seek

, and evaluate active students for

the chairmanships of various SG
commitees and to create a me-
chanism for students to investi-
gate issues and establish commit-
tees relevant to student life.”

Baum also presented an outline
of an all-University judicial sys-
tem in which students would be
responsible for and to their peers.
Such a system would give the
power to expel to students them-
selves.

He favored the initiation of
new courses and a wider range of
courses acceptable for Distribu-

’ tion of Studies, stating that "stu-

dents must decide where relevan-
cy lies."

Baum concluded by stressing
the need to “utilize the student
body to bring issues before the
administration.”

Steve O’Neill (STP) declared
that his party wants more students
in S tu d e n t Government. "We
want to lower the'QPA require-
ment for participation in elec-
tions. The present requirement of
2.5 makes half the school inelegi-

S ble-"

"O’Neill stated his intent to in-

terest and involve students in SG

by "campus publications, gener-

al assemblies, referendums, and
' opening wide all SG meetings."

 

  

His platform calls for the abol-
ishment of the language require-
ment with the institution of an
optional conversation program.
STP wants two pass-fail courses
in every area of Distribution of
Studies, as well as new areas of
study to be instituted.

O’Neil said his tenure in SG
would bring about change by ap-
plying pressure on the adminis-
tration.

He also explained that his con-
ception of SG would include sen-
ators assigned areas of specializ-
ation in accordance with individ-
ual special backgrounds.

Bill _Chrisner, STP vice-presi-
dential candidate, stated that a
grace period is needed after a re-
searched bill is introduced into
the senate. He pointed out that
bills are often passed the same
night that they are introduced.

At this point, Marc Simon,
FARCE presidential candidate,
asked permission to speak._ He
stated that he was running to rep-
resent the students of the Univer-
sity community who don’t care
a b o u t Student Government.
“Since I don’t care, I am the log-
ical candidate,” Simon said. He
suggested that the student body
“make the election a farce.”

Students Toward Progress

(See Text Page 5.)

Believing that a complete
change in the philosophy and tac-
tics of Student Government is
needed, the Students Toward Pro-
gress (STP) party was establish-
ed. Stating as its ‘basic premise
that SG’s role “is not to dictate
policy to the student body but to
carry out the wishes of its consti-
tuents and to be sensitive to stu-
dent needs.” STP wants to rec-
ognize special problems of com-
muters, Greeks, dorm residents,
black students, and athletes.

— STP urges that the Universi-
ty raise the caliber of its faculty
by offering professors salaries
comparable to those provided at
other major universities.

—The College of Arts and Sci-
ences should provide more free-
dom to its students by permitting
each student to take two courses
for distribution on a pass-fail bas-
is in each of thethree major dis-
ciplines.

—SG should support the Black
Action Society in its effort to give
black students a larger role in the
University. More black students
must become involved in SG.

—Since SG must be the repre-
sentative body of all students and
not an honorary, STP urges that
the QPA requirements for sena-
tor be lowered to 2.25. The'pre—
sent requirement of 2.5 makes
half the school ineligible.

(See Text Page 5.)

The Students For a Democratic
Society (SDS)' pledges to “putt
forth a radical, democratic pro-
gram whose methods embody the
democratic vision.” They main-
tain that there must be “not only
a visionary change in America,
but also at the University of Pitts-
burgh.” 5

The platform of SDS promul-
gates the following recommenda-
tions: ‘

—Abolish ROTC on campus

—Cesation of military recruting
on campus

—Complete support of the de-
mands of the members of the
Black Action Society

—Establishment of a system of,
education without grades.

—Establishment of a Federal
minimum wage for all employees
of the University of Pittsburgh and
SAGA Food Service

—Restructure the University’s
Business activities by eliminating
all exploitive business relationships
with the community and students.

SG Passes ‘Bill of Rights’

On Wednesday, the Student Government Sen-
ate passed a statement of ten guarantees of student

rights. These rights include:

1. Students should have protectiontlagainst pre-
judiced or capricious academic evaluation.

2. Information from disciplinary or counseling
files should not be available to unauthorized per-
sons on campus, or to any person off campus with-
out consent of the student or under extreme cir-

cumstances.

3. Records’ should not reflect the political ac-

tivities or beliefs of students.

4. Students should be free to support causes by
orderly means which do not disrupt operation of

the University.

5. Students- should be allowed to invite and hear

any person of their choosing.
6.? _Stu_dent. press should be

v



 

V free of censorship

and advance approval of copy; editors should have
freedom to develop their own policies.

7. Institutional authority should never be used

to duplicate the

community are

functions of general laws. Only '

where the institution’s interests as an academic

clearly and distinctly involved

should the authority of the institution be asserted.

8. Premises occupied by students, and the per-
sonal possessions of students, should not be search-

ed without proper authorization, except under emer-

gency circumstances.

9. The student should be as free as possible

from imposed limitations that have no direct rele-
vance to his education.

10. In all situations, the student should be in-

formed of the charges against him, and be given an’

opportunity to refute them.» The institution should

Applications and details

An astonishing number of

people make a stupid and tragic
mistake. To put it simply, they
jump into careers without really
looking. The result—a dreary life
of frustration and anger.

Can this happen to you? Could
be-—unless you can answer ques-

. tions like these to your own satis-

faction before you make your move:
Are you really a Chief...or an
Indian? '
g Do you belong in a big organi-
zation? Or a small one? Or do you

- belong by yourself?

Can you really stand pressure?

There are a great many serious
questions you must ask—and an-
swer—about a career. But the most
critical are the ones you ask your-
self about you. Unless you can an-
swer them honestly, it makes little
sense to ask, for example, “What’s
it really like to be an investment
banker?”

CAREERS TODAY can tell you
what it’s like to be an investment
banker. More important, this
meaningful new magazine can help

_ you decide whether becoming an

investment banker is even a sen-
sible option for you in the first
place!

“It’s a magazine about careers
that starts not with jobs, but with
people. And it’s dedicated to the
proposition that you must do your
own thing...and that if you don’t,
you run the grave risk of blowing
your life.

CAREERS TODAY is relevant. For
people who are searching...from
people who have discovered how to
do their own thing.

Hey, that's our job! . . .

against the welfare system in-
cluded lack of sufficient funds
for recipients, moral judgments
placed upon them and case work-
ers who don’t inform the public
of their rights.

Mrs. Clemintine Ward, North
Side Chairman of the Welfare
Rights group, listed some of the
rights that caseworkers don’t
tell the public. “For example,”
Mrs. Ward said, “Most recipi-
ents of welfare don’t know that
they may put their earnings in
an educational trust fund for
their children, without having the
amount of assistance they re-
ceive decreased.” .

“The function of the Welfare

_Rights Committee of Allegheny

County is to inform the recipi-
ents of their rights, to investi-
gate held-up checks and to receive
humanitarian treatment from the
caseworkers,” she added.

Mr. Henry Ward, another re-
cipient of public assistance, list-

ed his grievances as the lack of
funds for recipients and the moral

judgments that are placed upon.

them.

“Most people are under‘ the im-
pression that recipients of public
assistance receive enough money
to maintain 95% of a ‘decent stand-
ard of living. In 1957, a standard,
often referred to as the Wood-
bury Standard, was established.
It listed items, not dollar
amounts, which constituted the
barest essentials. The last time
the standard was priced was the
fall of 1966, so what public assist-
ance actually boils down to is
90% of the 1966 cost of a
1957 standard of living.”

Henry also emphasized that the

recipients need more than mon-'

ey. “A soe_i_al__service organiza-
tion is needed rather than the
moral judgments of the adminis-
tration.”

“There are 73,000 people on as-
sistance in Allegheny County.

would you like to
recruit top grads for

top jobs with a  
top company?

and unless

This is the company that is pio-

Fifty thousand of these are Chil-
dren, while the residue of em-
ployables is less than 4%. Cutting
assistance to these people means
raising anti-social people. You
can’t change the father by punish-
ing the children.”

Tom Trobe, moderator, sum-
med up the discussion by stat-
ing, “Revolution in Welfare does
not mean an overthrow of the
present system, but a change. To
do so, we must change the public
mind.”

Students can help by working
in welfare rights booths, aid in

transportation problems, make

contacts for public speaking en-
gagements or encourage others to
write or talk to their congress-

men to vote for higher appropri-
ations.

Platform Analysis

The concerned students at the University have now been presented with
the traditionaldanuary panacea——the Student Government campaign platforms.

 And they are indeed impressive—so impressive that they resemble all the party

platforms of years past.

Both the Students Toward Progress (STP) and the Independent Students
Association (ISA) have promulgated manifestos stressing the fact the Student
Government must represent the students.

The old Association for Responsible Action (ARA) party of 1967 was
dedicated to the principle that “Student Government should be composed of
A responsible students whose actions and goals are representative of the student
body. The primary purpose,” they said, “of Student Government is to faith-
fully represent what the students want, not what a self seeking fringe thinks
they should want. We seek to represent all of the students, and claim no allegi-
ance to a single campus faction.”

The last Pitt Progressive Party platform (1967) stressed the need to con-
sul students “before decisions directly affecting student life are made.”

These promises, unfortunately, were lodged on a treadmill to oblivion. ‘

The students were never really consulted about Student Government decisions
or controversial issues because the students, existing in their own states of vapid

‘ complacency, just didn’t give a damn about their seemingly irrelevant organ

of representation.

These platforms of the past pointed to such problems as parking, stu-
dent’ participation in University planning, expansion, policy making, prob-
lems of the bookstore, adequate locker space in the Cathedral, the construction
of a new Student Union, and the removal of the ten per cent city amusement
tax.

Some of these past recommendations have been initiated. And in some
cases, constructive change resulted. Even so, Student Government, in the past,

has not gained a genuine student legitimacy. The platforms of the past reflect
the character of Student Government——a seemingly irrelevant group of status

H ----seekers, who liked to hear themselves talk. Who in the student body ever re-

spected a Student Government senator? _ E,

Student Government, in short, has no legitimacy.‘Through‘out SG Presi-

dent Ken Schueler’s tenure, the Student Government has attempted to bridge_ _

the cracks between students, faculty and administration. Schueler has moved
SG in the direction of forming solid bonds with the faculty and in some re-
spects the administration. But the present SG has not healed the wounds
amongst the student groups.

The present SG made significant gains in the areas of student rights-
the right of each and every student to be a full citizen in the University com-
munity. And a Legal Awareness Committee was formed to protect those stu-
dent rights. Despite these gains, the students on campus did not truly respect
the Schueler regime. Only a smattering of students attended the bi-weekly SG
meetings. The so called General Assembly—a happening to open up some sort
of student dialogue—was a failure, due to lack of student interest.

Student Government at this teeming. institution seems to be doomed to
failure. Commuters, dorm students, Greeks, independents, and graduate stu-
dents can’t identify with an organization-—Student Government—that-has seem-
ed so distant to their individual wants and desires. This is a dismal, but realistic
picture of the present situation. What are the prospects for the future? Can

either the ISA or the STP meet the noble challenge of getting students involved

in Student Government?

The prospects seem doubtful. The ISA believes that one answer to the
problem of student involvement lies in the formation of an Appointments Com-
mittee. The purpose of this new organ, if formed, is to seek and evaluate active
students for chairmanships, to create a mechanism for the students “to investi-
gate issues and establish committees relevant to active student life, and to ex-
amine the existing committee or system” deemed not to be functioning well.
The success of this idea lies on the precarious assumption that students will be

excited about participating in this mechanism. What happens if the students '

choose not to take part in this Appointments Committee?

The platform of the STP Party has its drawbacks. The platform suggests
that SG strongly support the Commuter Association in its quest for on-campus
lounges, study areas, etc. By sponsoring such action, SG would aid the com-
muters. But would such action bring the commuters into the mainstream of Uni-
versity life? These improvements are necessary, but will not cure the com-
muter problems. This STP suggestion is treating the symptoms, not the causes.

. ~ Both parties urge programs‘ to increase student participation in Univer-
sity life, and to get the students involved. They have both mapped ways in
which their particular programs will create student interest and subsequent
legitimacy for SG. Unfortunately, these measures, in one way, shape, or form
have been tried in the past. And they have obviously failed.

The trouble with the student body—and many of its elected officials——is
that they cling to the past. The newly elected SG president will have a hard
time of it, unless he can initiate a_ sure proposal for student identification. Un-
less all the diverse groups on campus can emotionally identify with a unifying

cause, SG will never be representative; it will remain distant, and seemingly
irrelevant.

. Student Government must foment student identification through student
v1ctor1es—accomplishements with which all students can vigorously and proud-
ly ldentify. Without these “victories,” Student Government will sink in the

. quicksand of obscurity.

Goodbye Mr. Schueler

   

By DAVID ROSENBLUM
Staff Columnist

With the SG elections taking place next
week, it’s time for this writer to take a
look at our outgoing president, Ken Schue-
ler. I’ve known Ken for some time, and it
was with the utmost surprise that I dis-
covered he was planning to run for presi-
dent. When I asked himthe reason, he said
he’d been thinking about it for a long while
and he thought he could do something for
the school. He told me this in that stutter-
ing, blinking manner that always conveys
a sincere conviction
of belief.

During the cam-
paign, he confided
that he was very wor-
ried about the chal-
lenge of Armand Belly
and his platform to
abolish student govern-
ment. He was worried .
not so much that he '
would lose; he was;
worried because he had the sneaking sus-
picion that Belly might be correct in his
assertion that SG was a useless organ. When
he won the election by forty—some votes,
he was, to say the least, concerned about
his slim margin of victory.

FOR THE FIRST four months of his
administration Ken fell into that same
frustrated bag that most student presi-
dents find themselves imprisoned. He’d be
running around school seeing Dean Char-
les or Dean Jack, and most times he
wouldn’t even look up to say hello. Some of
his friends felt this was how the typical
snobbish president behaved; but I always
thought that he was too wrapped up in his

ROSENBLUM

' thoughts about way-s to implement his

ideas,. ideas that he thought, with his old
naivete, would fall into place.

I didn’t see Ken again until the fall tri-
mester and the change was somewhat
shocking. Columbia had happened, and
some students were beginning to realize
that they didn’t have to be slaves to their
school. Ken fell into this category. A few
of the changes were external. He started
sporting burns and threw around words
like "chicks” and.“crap.” For those who
didn’t know him before his big change, it
was quite an experience to hear Kenneth

 

    

Schueler say “crap” for the first time.

He began to fight for new social rules
and a greater voice for the students. He
seemed uncomfortable in his new role, but
he knew what had to be done. He was called
a fascist pig by some, and an anarchist by
others. But I don’t think the names both-
ered him. With the old naivete long gone,
I'm certain he rather expected it.

-I DON'T WANT to digress into an in-
depth review of every piece of legislation
that his administration created because
that is not what is important about the
year Ken Schueler was president. What is
important is, that for the first time a stu-
dent acted like a president. He asserted
his ideas, always stood by them, and made
the faculty -and administration respect
him. I don’t think he worried whether they
liked him, but that respect was so import-
ant.

Every so often he would do something
that was rather dramatic in his attempt
to fulfill the obligations of his office. The
one instance l’ll never forget was when the
faculty met to vote on the accredidation of
ROTC.

The faculty declared that no students
would be allowed to sit in on the meeting,
not even the student president. I was
standing outside the door with Ken, some

other reporters, and Dean ‘Mulgrave. As

the meeting got underway, I'could see Ken
getting madder and madder. You know
he’s mad because the color of his face re-
sembles an eggplant. Finally he walked up
to Mulgrave and said, ‘

“I’M GOING IN THERE-. I have a re-
sponsibility to the students to be in on an
important decision like this.”

With that, he brushed the Dean aside
and walked in. No one in the room said
anything, and I’ll always believe that
none of them had the nerve to speak to Ken
when he had his determined look on.

There will be a lot of deep breaths when
Ken steps down, but not from me. I always
felt secure knowing that he was sittingup
in his office on Mt. Olympus, watching
over us poor mortals and trying to make
things a little better. Zeus, you were one
helluva president. And now maestro, a
thousand choruses of "For He’s A Jolly
Good Fellow,” if you please.

 

Another Dave Hart?

 

 

STEVEN B. HECHT
English ’69
Special to The Pitt News

Please add my name to the list of those
who got caught in the athletic department
housecleaning. My case may be a little un-
usual. I’m only an undergraduate.

Recently, I received a letter informing
me that I had been fired from my job as an
English tutor. The sender of the letter
mentioned to me that he thought some-
thing could be done to improve my “per-
sonality so that our kids will be glad to
come to you for instruction.”

WHAT IS MEANT . I

by change in personal-
ity? Does it mean I’m-
lazy and not doing my
job? Does it mean I
should resolve my
more obvious ego-con-
flicts or perhaps try
psychoanalysis? No.
It means nothing of the
sort. It is simply an I ,
implied statement meaning,
beard off or lose your job.”

Obviously, I lost my job as- my heard
is still alive and well and living in Pitts-
burgh.

More important, the letter goes on to
say thatthe boys are not taking advantage
of my services. llwonder how this is

-known.

No one from the Athletic Department
came to sit in on my class sessions to
check attendance. No one mentioned any-
thing to me when after nearly two full
terms of teaching four nights a week at an
hour and forty-five minutes a session, I
only missed three classes (which, I dare
say is a better record, than some fulltime
faculty can claim).

   

__ beard,

No one said “thanks” or “good job”
when I voluntarily attended eight weekly
freshmen lecture sessions to keep up with
changes that might have been brought in-
to the curriculum since I took the course
three years ago. ‘

NO ONE FOUND my students receiv-
ing flunking or disgraceful grades. No
one said to me that there were complaints
registered against me because I was per-
forming my job in an inadequate manner.

In "short, there was no investigation.
There was only the thought that I had a
this is therefore a detrimental
influence on young athletes and therefore
I had to go. Consideration of my record
as an effective tutor does not exist.

The loss of the job means that there is
a couple of hundred dollars this term that
I’ll have to do without. What irks me is that ’
this situation was brought about by a de-
cisionwhich I feel is the result of narrow-
minded thinking and unjustified reasoning
on the part of an ill-informed authority.

I HAVE ALL intentions of keeping my
beard. It doesn’t hamper MY thinking at
all. I’d also like my job back but as I re-
view the tone of this letter I must admit
that my chances are probably reduced to
slim and none.

However, I feel the printing of this pro-
test will accomplish something. Hopeful-
ly, it will show students and faculty that
that there is an element of the University
community that is not concerned with what
I know, or how I perform or what contri-
bution I might make as an employe but
rather has gotten itself pretty up-tight
ov_er’the apparently disgraceful amount of
shrubbery that’s growing on my face.

I.S.A. Platform  

The Independent Student's Association

The function of the university is to provide every
student with the opportunity to learn. In order for

' learning to take place an atmosphere of mutual re-

spect, dignity, and awareness must exist. It is the
function of a concerned Student Government to acti-
vely strive to achieve and maintain such an atmos-
phere,‘with the aid of a student body willing to ac-
cept the rights and responsibilities of adults in an
academic community.

1. As a first step in the student taking responsi-
bility for himself in the academic community, all
courses for which there is no prerequisite in the un-
dergraduate bulletin be accepted for Distribution of
Studies credit.

2. The faculty of the School of Engineering should
institute a number of interdisciplinary courses deal-
ing with engineering material for freshmen who are
undecided about their major field and to provide lib-
eral arts students with a background in engineering. ‘

3. Any group of concerned students may, under
the auspices of a faculty member, petition for the in-
itiation of a credit bearing course. This would range
from sex-education courses to community action pro-
jects. ' Q

4. The replacement of the present advising system
with a staff of professionally trained advisors aided
by a number of paid seniors in each department
available for consultation in each field.

V 5. In view of the projected figure of 33,000 stu-
dents attending the University by 1975, the adminis-
tration must make a committment to plan ade-
quate facilities for assimilating these students into
the University. These plans must be made public
and open to student criticism and suggestion.

6, The University Bookstore should be a co-opera-
tive, student run enterprise.
7. Hillman Library facilities should be enhanced

by the installation of food and drink machines in a
designated lounge area.

8. Strong pressure should be brought by the stu-
dent body on the administration to meet with city of-
ficials and pressure them into providing some solu-
tions to the problems of transportation and parking
for commuters.

9. Student Government should press for more
student representation on faculty and administra-
tion committees.

10. The University should lease apartments in the
Oakland area for student housing.

11. Student Government should support the con-
struction of Fraternity Row.

12. Student Government should actively support
and demand action on the petitions and recommenda-
tions of the ‘Pitt News Sports staff and SG concern-
ing Pitt’s football program.

13. Student Government shall institute an all-Uni-
versity judicial system, stressing substantive and pro-
cedural due process of law. This system is to be
student-oriented and directed.

14. Student Government shall create an Appoint-
ments Committee. Its function shall be threefold:

1. To seek and evalutate active students for the
chairmanships of various Student Govern-
ment committees;

2. To create a mechanism for students to inves-
tigate issues and establish committees rele-
vant to student life;

3. To examine an existing committee or system
which the student feels is not performingits
function properly.

15. Student Government undertake a_ careful study
of its present structure and initiate aseries of re-
forms aimed at making Student Government more
relevant and more attuned to the Student Body.

SDS PLATFORM FOR STUDENT
GOVERNMENT ELE_CTIONS

The role of the university is determined by the so-
ciety in which it exists. There are inherent weakness-
es", prejudices and interests in the structure of
American society and the university necessarily re-
flects them. ’

- Students for A Democratic Society maintains a
vision of a democratic society, where at all levels the
people have control of the decisions which affect
them and the resources on which they are dependent.
It seeks a relevance through the continual focus on
realities and on the programs necessary to effect
change at the most basic levels of economic, poli-
tical, and social organization‘. It feels the urgency
to put forth a radical, democratic program whose
methods embody the democratic vision. SDS main-
tains that not only must there be a visionary change
in American society, but also at the University of
Pittsburgh:

1) Abolish all forms of ROTC on Campus. No more

 

 

defense research or military recruiting on campus.
SDS views the ROTC, defense research, and mili-
tary recruiting on campus as parts of the system of
U.S. oppression and exploitation of the peoples of
the world. V

We support the demands of the Black Action
Society.

3) Institute the pass no credit system for all non-
major and elective courses. Graded classes are un-_
fair to the student and condition him for exploita-
tion in a competitive society.

4) Establish The Federal minimum wage for all
employees of the University and SAGA Food Ser-
vice.

5).Restructure the University’s Business Activi-
ties. The University must eliminate all exploitative
business relationships with the community and stu-
dents. The University should cease depending on in-

— come derived from high rents and establish cooper-

ative housing wherever possible, and, in general, de-
velop into a cooperative institution that serves the
community.

 

Hey, I’m A Candidate

 

Special to the Pitt News

I would like to announce at this time my candi-
dacy for the office of President of Student Govern- _
ment at this here University.

I am running on the Freedon and Radical Con-
servative Elements Party, or, as we like to call it,
F.A.R.C.E.

I shall now cover all the grave issues of the Uni-
versity in the next few hundred words:

First, I will discuss the parking problem that has
plagued us for so long. I feel students should be go-
ing to class during the day instead of parking. If
they want to park, let them go up by the Schenley
Oval or come back on a Sunday when there are a
lot of spaces. Who needs these insurrectionists?

THE NEXT PROBLEM is course selection. I

4 feel any student should be able to take any course

he wants, providing that it is being offered. The
student should not take courses that aren’t taught.
However, if the student has a great knowledge of some
subject not being taught—for example, basketball
statistics or ‘lamp—lighting—he should be given
three credits for this, on a pass-fail basis. After all,
this IS a liberal University.

Another controversial subject is the price of books
in the University Book Center. It seems they are
determined to maintain their high prices. Students
feel they are unjust. The solution is simple. We will
no longer require books in our courses. The student
will benefit by the money saved (to be used wisely

/

at Bimbo’s or Gustine’s), and the book store will be
driven out of business. Thusly, we see a manifestation
of Student Power, if not Mental, power. But what is
really important, students or mentals‘?

WHAT ABOUT THE high costs at the Univer-
sity? A little common sense once again‘ will solve
the problem. I submit that we should turn the Stu-
dent Union back into a hotel. Thus, we can raise
money from room rent and save money by cutting
out all of those unnecessary offices.

Am I in favor of new social rules? Yes, but first
let’s break the old ones.

Another problem we face is that there are police,

uniformed and plain—clothed, on this campus. Should
we allow them to be here? Well, we must consider
all sides of the question. Certainly, students don’t
like to be policed, but do police really like to be
studented? And anyway, where is a better place
for a cop to loaf than inside the Tower’s Lobby?

Well, that about covers it. As Susan D. Dubow’s

father once said, “The chip’s never as good as the
putt that follows.”

P.S. I am a legitimate candidate, 300 signatures

on a petition, so my name will probably be on the
ballot. Remember, let’s turn this election into a
FARCE. , 2

Friday, January 17,1969!-TIVIE PITT Nisws-Pastel 

S.T.P. Platform

The present Student Government has worked in a vacuum. It‘
has not considered the opinions of the majority of the student body.
It has not recognized the special problems of commuters, Greeks,-v

dorm residents, black students, and athletes. It has not co-operated 7 

with other student organizations, and it has not applied student pres-

sure when needed. Believing that a complete change in the philo-_j’ 

sophy and tactics of Student Government is needed, the STP Party .-
has been established. Our basic premise is that Student Govern-.

ment’s role is not to dictate policy to the student body; rather, its . 
purpose is to carryout the wishes of its constituents and be sensi-  ‘

tive to student needs. Only when this is accomplished will a mean-
ingful Student Government exist. .

‘Since the educational environment Pitt provides affects all. stu-I 1' '

dents, we urge: I

_ 1. That Pitt raise the caliber of its faculty by offering pro- 
fessors salaries comparable to those provided at other major univer- ,

sities.

2. That Pitt not allow the size of the student body to increase - I

until an adequate number of faculty have been hired to insure that
classes will not continue to become larger and larger. Dialogues
between faculty and students must be maintained to insure this ad-
ditional sections of popular courses must be offered.

3. That Pitt preserve its cosmopolitan nature by hiring addi-
tional admissions staff and making available additional-scholarship
funds to attract out-of-state students.

4. That the College of Arts and Sciences provide more free-‘ I A

dom to its students by permitting each student to take two courses

for distribution on a pass-fail basis in each of the three major dis- A 

ciplines. .
5. That the present language requirement be abolished and re-

‘ placed by an optional program in conversational .foreign language.

6. That new programs and majors in timely areas be established.

 

Examples of this include public and business administration, urban ‘

affairs, international relations, and Afro-American studies.

To co-ordinate these areas, an overall Academic Cabinet of Stu-'
dent Government should be formed. The presently existing academ-

_ ic cabinet in the College, Engineering, nursing, education and‘

pharmacy should become sub-divisions of this body.

It is the duty of Student Government to aid all segments of the
student body. We therefore urge:

1. That Student Government strongly support the Commuter As- , -

sociation in their plea for on-campus lounges, study areas, less-ex-
pensive meals. in the Towers Cafeteria, and more adequate parking.
Permit parking areas. not used at night should be made available
to commuters, and the University should provide Saga Food with

sufficient funds that mealscan be offered to commuters in the Tow-_ » C ;'i:

ers at a more reasonable price. Only through this type of action can

we have a united student body. _ -  
2. That Student Government be aware of the problems of the I

Greek system. It should strongly support their request for a- Frater-
nity Row--.' Because the Greeks work for the University community,

Student Government must make the Chancellor to issue a statement . -  I

endorsing the Greek System.

3. That Student Government support the Black Action Society ‘in
its effortto give black students a larger role in the University. More
black students must become involved in_ Student Government. ~ '

4. That Student Government should be more responsive to student

needs for employment. Student Government must see to it that greater i  .

attention is given to hiring students first and paying them better

wages.

5. That Student Government move to organize students living off
campus to eliminate discrimination in rental practices and prohibi-
tive rents. ~

It is the responsibility of Student Government in instituting : 

changes that will improve the day-to-day life at Pitt. Therefore:

1. For the safety of students going to and from class in the Com-.
mon ‘Facilities Building or the Clapp—Langley-Crawford complex
traffic lights must be installed at Tennyson and Fifth and at Forbes
and Sennott.

2. A lighting engineer should be consulted on the inadequate.
lighting in the Commons Room, and steps must be taken to provide
better lighting for study purposes.

3. That Student Government apply continued pressure on the Ad-
ministration until it changes existing athletic policies sufficiently so

that Pitt can produce winning teams. The feasibility of instituting , 

a training table and a physical education major must be considered.

4. That ‘Student Government have a permanent interest regis-
tration and advising procedures. The goal must be to minimize the '
red tape and maximize the student’s opportunity to take those courses
he desires. —

5. That Student Government support—but not take over—~the very
much needed student judicial boards on campus. Student Government
must work to insure that the students regulate their own conduct.

V In order to be successful, Student Government must re-evaluate _. 
its old procedures and mechanisms and establish many new ones:

1. Much greater use must be made of General Assemblies,
referendums, and forums to insure that the entire student body is
aware of and participating in the resolution of problems facingithem.
Further, each senator must seek out the viewpoint of those groups
with which he is associated. For this reason, our slate includes
members of the student body from all segments.

2. A “City-Relations” committee must be established to work with
the City of Pittsburgh. This committee could facilitate our getting
needed traffic lights and parking. It could also take.a stand in oppos- 3
ition to the proposed tax on all students.

5. Student Government must not only fight for more student re-
presentation on faculty and administrative committees but must also «
insure that the students sitting on these committees are aware of the
wishes of their constituents. For example, the students on the Build-

ings and Grounds Committee must be aware of the commuters’ need -A 

for lockers.

 Dave Adams is anticipating a. close match tomorrow as
g is-matmen, still looking for their first dual victory of the sea-
'*son, tackle Temple at the Field House at 8 p.m.

. 3 Temple beat the grapplers last year 21-14 and according to Adams,
:they_ have a better squad this year than last. “They have a pretty good

earn,” quipped Adams. “So far this year, they’ve slaughtered Syra-
-gcuse. Their margin in that match was comparable to what Navy did

Zﬁagainst them. (Syracuse).

a.“I anticipate a close match.
_i.Wle have the opportunity to beat
«them. A good student turnout
might carry us over the top.”

Adams has stressed the impor-

-_-tance of student support at the

leets all season and he’s hoping
.,for a full-house Saturday night.
If the students have any pride in
«their school they should be up
" ere.” ' '
*.Adams’ lineup Saturday night
ill be identical to the one he
fiused against Navy last week, but
h'a't line-up will be quite dif-
erent from that which faced Tem-
le_ last year.

‘fMost of the boys used last
ear were older boys and they’re
one,” he explained. Of the ten
tarters, only three of them wrest-
édagainst Temple .last year. Of
hose three, senior Larry Cuba was
,,,é'only winner. He registered a

-.:6.dec_ision over Dave Thorpe in
he,137 match. ‘

'-Temple, meanwhile, is led by
everal outstanding returnees, in-
luding four or five boys whom

3lAdams feels have an excellent .

hance‘ to win places in the East-

7.‘One of the leading returnees is

ayne Boyd,.a senior who wrest-
ed at 123 last year and was a
lace winner in the Easterns.

oyd moves up to 130 this sea-
on. In last year’s match, Boyd

-jiaiid Bruce Unangst drew.

-‘Boyd moved up to 130 to make
troom for sophomore Bill Floire, a
:3’-former New Jersey state champ
{who -will wrestle at 123. Floire
j.was named the outstanding wrest’-
ilerf in, the New Jersey state high
school tourney.

Wally Strosser, from Erie Cathe-
‘Edral Prep, is another outstanding
Vspphomore. Strosser, who goes at
'” 52, was a state Catholic cham-

 Other top performers for coach
«John Rogers include Dave. Pruzan-
4 ky, Dave Thorpe and Noel Kobia.
‘Prjuzansky, a two-time New Jersey
'-state champ, and Thorpe have been
alternating between 137 and 145,

l.while,Kobia goes at 167.

Other probable starters for
;_Temple include Steve Alexander
a"a_t 160, George Jenkins at 177,

Mark Baretz at 191 and Bob Green-

food at heavyweight. Baretz p_in- 1

ed Terry Hoover last year, while
enkins beat Jack Kuhn.

V -"With Cuba going at 130, he

‘i~won’t be facing Thorpe in a re-

match, but will tackle Boyd in-
téad. Tom Grant, at 123, will

or’Adams include Pat Lavery
137), Mark Payne, Co-captain
I45), Buddy Morris (152), Paul
_llen' (191). and Ralph Cindrich
Unl.) Morris suffered a slight leg
injury in last‘week’s match, but
siready to go.

Although the grapplers lost the
ecision to Navy last week, Adams
xplains that his boys did better
han‘ many people had’ expected
h‘  to do, “We'_gave a.better

a lift for this week.”

“Navy is as tough as anybody in
the East. We’re disappointed we
lost yet we’re not disheartened.
We realized how good Navy was.

Our team might surprise ‘a few -

people this year. They’re just as
good as they want to be.”

Season Debut

Frosh Face California

by MARTHA HARTLE

The freshman grapplers
open their four-meet schedule
tomorrow night as they play

host to the California State (Pa.)"
freshmen at 6 pm. in the Field
House.

According to assistant mat
coaph Bob Fehrs, the freshmen
have been working hard and are
looking forward to their 'first
meet. “We don’t have many meets
so the boys get pretty psyched
for each one. I’m pretty, well
pleased with the way they’ve look-
ed so far.”

Fehrs held eliminations for
starting berths this week and his
line-up for Saturday night is set
at all weight classes with the ex-
ception of 123. “We have seven
boys competing at 123 and I’m
still not sure who will start,” he
explained. “Right now it will be
either Ken Hopes of Beth Center
or Bob Pinkos of Penn Hills.”

Dave Wiley, from Avella, Pa.,
has nailed down the starting job
at 130, while Lloyd Mason gets
the nod at 137. Mason is from
Shaler. Buddy Smeltz, Hope-
well, will start at 145, while Joe
Schantz is the starter at 152.

Other probably starters in-
clude Dennis Schirf from La-
trobe at 160, Jim Fleming, Mt.
Lebanon, at 167, Willie Saloky,
Easton, at 177 and Dave Young,
Evergreen Park, 111., at heavy-
weight. There will be no compe-
tition at 191 in the freshmen meet.

“Most of our boys did as we ex-

pected them to in the elimina-
tions,” continued Fehrs. “My only

LARRY CUBA, (top) senior co-captain, draws another tough oppon-'
ent‘ tomorrow night, as he goes against ’_I‘emple’s Wayne B_oyd,Aan _

California. is reported to have a
fairly . strong squad. “They got
several good boys from this area,”
commented Fehrs. “They have a
real nice team. As far as I know
they've‘ won one match pretty
handily so far this season, so they
do have mat experience on us.

“We beat them last year 20-13,
but they think theyhave a much
better squad this year,” he added.

In last year’s match, California
got two quick pins in the first two
matches, but the frosh fought back
to win the meet.

Saturday’s match is a prelimin-
ary to the varsity meet with Tem-
ple and the coaches are hopeful of
a large turnout by the student
body. The night has also been -de-
signated as High School Wrestlers
Night and numerous high school

squads will also be in attendance.

the track program will finally see action as varsity competitors when
the Golden Flashes of Kent State invade the Field House. The meet

starts at noon.

There will be sixteen sophs on the roster, a tremendous sign of
inexperience, but this doesn’t worry Banner too much.

“They’re a pretty complemen-
tary bunch of boys. They know
what they’re doing,” he mention-
ed. “They are mostly all sopho-
mores——good sophomores — and

_ they have good spirit.

“They want to‘win . . . and
that’s what we’re here for,” he
added.

Jerry Richey, the best known
soph, should be in the most in-
teresting races when he” goes
against Kent’s Ed Coolidge in the
mile and two-miler. Coolidge, like
Richey, is an All-American Cross
Country runner. A couple of great
races should materialize — if
Richey is ready to run. He had to
skip the C.Y.O. Invitational in
Washington last week because
of an ankle sprain, and is now suf-
fering a heavy cold. —

A second Kent runner" who Ban-

ner seems concerned about is '

Westinghouse High’s Orin Rich-
berg. The Pittsburgher will pro-
bably go at it in the 50-yd. sprint
and asia member of the mile re-
lay team. He won.the “50” in
last week’s AAU meet at Bos-
ton.

Dave Garnett and Carl Woot-
en will try to catch Richberg in
the sprinting event. Wooten is -one
of only four seniors on the thin-
clad squad. '

Banner isn’t greatly concerned
with that relay team of Kent’s,
however. This isn’t because the
Flashes don’t look good. The coach
just likes his own relay quartets.

“They’re both, in my way of

thinking, very good relay teams,”
he boasted of his runners. The
mile will be run by Carlos Reisen,
Rudy Hufnagle, Wally Swiger,
and Smitty Brown. John Aiken,
Ken Lawton, Rudy Yaksick, and
Dick Werner will compete in the
two-mile chase.

The thinclads should be just as
strong in the jumping events this
winter. Bryant Salter is up from
last year’s frosh team; he’ll be
entered in the high jump and the
broad jump. Senior John Gurson,
who holds the Pitt record in the
long jump, will also compete in
the broad jump.

Banner’s hurdlers, tomorrow,
will be Dave Brinn and Elliot
Drysdale, while soph Jeff Snyder
is the pole vaulter. Greg Ellis
goes in the shot-put.

Is there any spot on the -team
that particularly bothers Banner?
“You worry about them all,” he
answered. “We are much strong-
er. than last year, though; parti-
cularly in numbers.” The coach
pointed out that he had only 12
or 13 athletes on varsity last year.

The freshmen of last year have
solved that problem for the time
being. More of the same should be
expected for next‘ season because
Banner has another fine frosh
group.

‘.‘Although we don’t have the
depth that the squad had last
year, we do have some outstand-
ing boys.” he stated.

Cagers Can Erase Lo sing Skeins

Against Troubled Penn State Five

by JERRY L. GRUEBEL

All things remaining _equal,
the cagers will have much
more of’a chance against the
Penn State .five tomorrow af-
ternoon than the gridders had
against the Lion eleven two
months ago.

The _Lion basketball team pre-
sents none of the overpowering
talent that football coach Joe Pa-
terno’s undefeated crew has to

- offer. With the loss of Jeff Pers-

son, junior guard Tom Daley be-

- came the quarterback on the basis

of his 15.3 points per game aver-
age last year.

Delay can look for. Bill Stans-
field, the much improved 6-8
center, underneath, and senior
guard Jim Linden. But all in all,
Penn State’s basketball team is
weak.

This doesn’t mean, however,
that the cagers will have an easy
time beating Penn State. Coach
Buzz Ridl has had a hard time
building a successful “new era”
in his first year at the University.
The cagers are currently in the
midst of an eight-game losing
streak, and a dismal, 2-9, season
mark.

Ridl is disappointed with his
team’s inability to put the ball
through the nets, and the cagers
might have even greater difficul-
ty against Penn State’s new de-
fense.

New coach John Bach, a highly
successful coach at Fordham Uni-
versity for 18 years, has installed
his pressure man-to-man defense
for which Fordham teams were

ENGINEERS

Chemical
Electrical/Electronic
Industrial

Mechanical

noted. Penn State teams have al-
ways used a zone defense in the
past.

Ridl also realizes that his squad
usually gives up height to its op-
ponents and Penn State will be
no different. Stansfield, although

he averaged no better than 8 re-

bounds per game last season, has
at least a three—inch advantage on
any of the cagers that will be
covering him.

During the big man’s college
playing career, the Lions have
yet to lose to the cagers. In fact,
the cagers haven’t beat Penn State
since their first of two games in
1964.

But the Penn State five is not
as strong as in the~past. This
year’s squad is having a tough
time keeping pace with last year’s
10-10 finish.

Last year, the cagers were

dropped by the Lions twice, 66-‘

43 and 77-68. Those losses mark-
ed the eight and ninth consecu-
tive defeats at the hands of their
Pennsylvania rivals.

But breaking the nine game
skein, and the eight-game losing
streak of this season "is by all
means possible. Unless maybe
Charlie Pittman and Ted Kwal-
ick don’ smeakers tomorrow af-
ternoon at University Park.

Hoopster Fast Reaches New Slow

Another Dave Hart?

In their latest scoring fast, the cagers were dumped, 53-30,
by Temple’s fast—breaking Owls Wednesday night at the Palestra.
It was the lowest point production by any cage team since 1952
when the cagers lost to Penn State, 24-9.

Thevhoopsters went into a slow-down that lasted from the
opening whistle to within seven minutes of the closing buzzer,
but the slow-down was much slower than planned. In fact, _it

was almost a freeze.

Temple (9-4) displayed a tormenting.'3—2 defense that kept
the cagers too far from the basket. When the cagers were in shoot-

ing range, they ‘often missed.

Coach Buzz Ridl installed junior guard Bob Petrini in the
starting line—up__ to beef up the scoring attack, but like the rest
of the cagers the Washington D. C. native didn’t have much
room to shoot. Petrini did however, lead the losers in scoring

with five baskets — 10 points.

Only three other cagers scored. Rob McFarland chipped in
with 9 points, Jerry Causer added 7, and sophomore Mike Cald-
well had 4. Mike Patcher, who’s ‘having his troubles this year,

was shutout. '

Springfield Hosts Gynmasts
as Neigers Small Contingentgi
Chases Years First Victory

Building a team from scratch is a long and many times,_un;-;
rewarding job, as attested to by coach Warren Neiger and ’hi__s¥.
seven gymnasts. Only a freshman club a year ago, the gym
nastics team goes into its third varsity match at Springfield to’-.

morrow with an 0-2 record.

Springfield, like Temple and Army before, is going to be a tough
meet. Although their record stands at 1-2, they are presently fifthin

the Eastern College Conference,
Springfield has beaten Navy 152-
142 and lost a real close match to
Temple, 154.575 — 153.225, the
team that defeated the gym-
nasts last week by a resounding
score of 148-88. ’

Some of the problems that
plagued the gymnasts last Satur-
day won’t be present this week.
For one, Mike Beatty, Neiger’s

- best long horse vaulter and one of

the better parallel bars man, will
be back after recovering from the
flu. _
“This in itself‘ will ‘hike our
score as we will nowhave three
scores in every event. Last week
two of our events only had two

_scores due to Mike’s injury,” ex-

plained Neiger.

Another bright spot is that Phil"
Lilly has recovered from a bad.
ankle that caused him to have
what Neiger refers to as a “‘ba_d-—
day” against Temple. Lilly may;
participate in as many as four-
events making his contributions
quite important to the team. I '

. Neiger and his’seven, though,
are looking at this match as an-
other test in seeing if they can
improve steadily with each meet.
Victory is a sought after but
distant goal for the gymnasts;~As-_
one can see, just an injury to.‘
one man hurts the team greatly,
expecially if he’s in three or four-
events. Building and improve-_‘
ment, then, are the important
goals. . l _
