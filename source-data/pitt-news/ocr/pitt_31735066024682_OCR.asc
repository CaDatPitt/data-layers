Effectsof Reagan Cuts
onPittsburghAna1yzed

By MARY KANE

Pitt News Stall Writer

Fewer jobs, increases in bus fares,
and cuts in the food stamp and hous-
ing programs could become a reality
in Pittsburgh if President Reagan’s
proposed budget cuts are approved,
according to participants in Pitt’s
Governmental Relations Commit-
tee budget forum on Wednesday in
the Student Union.

Robert Lurcott, planning director
for Pittsburgh Mayor Richard Cali-
guiri, said the full impact of the fed-
eral cuts is difficult to assess at a
local levl because they are still being
formulated: Lurcott added, how-
ever, that the following programs
will be affected by the proposed cuts:

—The Comprehensive Employ-
'ment Training Act’

According to Lurcott, two public
service ‘sections of the program are
to be eliminated, costing I65 city
jobs in areas such asrecreation and
rodent control. He added that non-
profit organizations, which utilize
approximately 1,000 CETA
workers, will also be affected by the
cut. . V

—Revenue Sharing

These funds comprisesix percent
of the ’city’s operating budget, or
nearly $12 million, and these cuts
will have a substantial impact on

V transportation subsidies, Lurcott
pointed out. He indicated the Port

‘Authority Transit System will lose
$16 ‘million under the President’s
proposal, forcing the state to sub-

. stantially increase its $30 million
allocation to PAT. This would mean
fare increases of 30 to 40 percent.

Lurcott also said highway mainte-
nance will be affected if Reagan’s

proposed cut ofr$90Q'million from
those programs is accomplished by
1984." S '

source for city-maintained bridges
and ‘highway repair costs,” Lurcott
said. “In addition, federal grant

— assistance for highway recondition-

ing programs in urban areas would
be eliminated.” _ . .
—Community Development
Lurcott indicated the‘ Urban
-Development Action Grant pro-
gram faces a cutback, along with the
rent subsidies, home improvement
loans and other housing assistance

' neighborhood.” _
“—The only thing we have in com-
mon is that we‘re both white males," A

“This allocation has hen the major.

programs. The UDAG progarm,
which produces 2,500 jobs, will be
cut from $24 million to $9 million. T
“The $25 million community block
grant program will not be cut,” Lur-
cott added, “but these funds will
have to take up the slack for funding
losses in other community develop-
ment areas." »

In addition to Lurcott, other
Pittsburgh civic and community
leaders, detailed how the President’s
proposed budget cuts will affect
their particular interests.

Fred Goehringer, a Republican
candidate for mayor of Pittsburgh,
said the cuts are aimed at eliminat-
ing administrative waste, not at
eliminating the programs.

“I don’t think Reagan or the con-
servatives who support him are
opposed to helping people who can’t
help themselves,” Goehringer said.
“They’re opposed to the high salar-
ies for the program administrators.

“The thing not-to lose sight of is
that the president is talking about

across-the-board cuts. Few pro-”
‘ grams are being cut ‘out altogether." "

James Ferlo, a representativefor

the Western Pennsylvania Coalition ‘

fo‘r Human Needs and Rights_, said

Goehringer represents the view of a ‘

minority because “he is wealthy, has
a'job and lives in a safe

Ferlo said.

Although Reagan heralded the
family during his cainpaign, his pro-
posed budget works against family
unity, Ferlo said. The cuts should be
viewed in terms of" people, not dol-
lars and cents, Ferlo added.

Cuts in the food stamp programs
will make 400,000 families ineligible;

CETA cuts will affect-minorities,’ 
who now hold 48 percent of those‘ _
‘ jobs, the availablilityof low income ; a

housing will be reduced, and the

Vista program is likely to be 'eli__ini-»

nated, according to Ferlo. " _
. “There is no longer a war on pov-

erty,” Ferlo said. “lt’s a war on the

working class and the poor."

Community Action representative»
Alic Nixon encouraged the audience .
to register to~vote, “get your folks to I

vote, and let yourself‘ be hear .”

ASP Incorporated into Fine Arts  

BY TIMOTHY MCCABE
For budgetary reasons,—the Archi-

tectural Studies Program (ASP) has -

been fully incorporated into the fine
arts department, ASP Director
Jones said yesterday, describing the
change as “virtually suicidal.”

Jones, who plans to resign after
this term due to “a continual battle
with the administration over fund-
ing and lack of support," said he
received a letter from College of Arts
and Science Dean lrwin Schulman
last Wednesday, informing him of
the change.

According to Jones, the letter said
that some $20,000 will be saved by
the adjustment and announced the

new director of ASP as . Professor
Milliard F. Hearn Jr., who is cur-
rently a fine arts faculty member.

APR was originally designed to,

examine the modern relationships
between architecture, social change,

and the environment, but Jones said '

under the authority of the ﬁne arts
department and the direction of
Hearn, a medievil art historian, the
program will lose its design.

Jones cited a special committee
review, ordered by Schulman last
spring when vice-provost and’ dean

V of the Faculty of Arts and "Science

Jerome Rosenburg threatened to
terminate Jones and ASP‘s inde-

pendence for financial reasons. It
was recommended that ASP remain
an independent program. , ' A

“The fine arts departments will
predetermine the nature of the pro-

gram," Jones said. “I think'it’s a "

likely outcome that the program will

‘be phased out,” he added.

Jones, who designed the program
in l973 ona pilot grant from the
National Endowment for the
Humanities, said of the administra-
tion’s appointment of Hearn, “They
are notreplacing the critical ingre-

dient that drives the; program, '

namely a professional architectural
educator.“

By AMIN GHOSSEIN

Assistant Sports Editor

Sitting atop his perch overlooking
the Pitt Field House, Dr. Roy Chip-
man must be trying hard to keep a
straight face. Yes, this is the Pitt
Field House where the likes of West-
minster, lndiana (Pa) and Delaware
State have played, and those are
binding letters-of-intend that Chip-
man is clutching for five very highly-
regarded basketball players. Add
another one who will sign by Satur-
day, and coach Roy Chipman has
good reason to smile.

How good are these new recruits?

Consider that Chip Watkins, a 6- '

foot-6 forward from Louisville, was
courted by the likes of DePaul, Ten-
nesee and Louisville, and was consi-
dered the second-best player in
Kentucky.

Consider that George Allen, a 6-
foot guard from New York City was
a Parade All-America and made
first team all-city. Along with fellow
New Yorker Andre Williams, a 6-
foot-7 all-city forward whom Syra-
cuse was drooling over, Pitt has to
consider its trip to the Big Apple a
success.

It doesn’t stop there, however.

From Connor State Junior Col-
lege in Oklahoma, by way of Mid-
land High School, Chipman, after

some touch moments, inked 6-foot-~

7 Roosevelt Kirby, a junior college
All-America and a player Chipman
feels should be able to contribute
right away.

“Kirby is a junior and is a player

SPORTS
Chipman Grabs Six

with experience. He can do a lot of
things and we expect him to step
right in and contribute," Chipman
said. i

“All of the players signed could
play next year. It all depends on how

they play over the summer,” Chip- .

man said.

The other recruit who has put his
signature on a national letter—of-
intent is Charley Thompson, a 6-
foot-5 guard from Phoenixville, Pa.

Described by assistant coach Reg-
gie Warford as “a Neverson-like
player with a better shooting touch,”
Thompson could be that big guard
Chipman is looking for to play the
point on defense.

And there is one more player
whom Pitt hasn’t signed yet, but
Chipman is not worried.

“He has told us he’s coming and
his coach has told us he's coming to
Pitt. It’s only a technical matter and
we have to wait until Saturday to
sign him.” '

The “he” Chipman is referring to
is 6-foor-9 Jeff Hoftler from New
Haven, Connecticut, who should

‘ sign with Pitt in the next couple of

days. Hofﬂer could be that center
for whom Pitt was looking. Hoffler
was recruited heavily by LSU and
Duauesne, but decided on Pitt after
coming here on his visit. Hoffler is
expected to play at center, but in his
later years he 'could wind up at
forward.

“He has a great verticaljump and
right now he will be a center,” Chip-
man said, “but he has the capabili-
ties to. play forward_.._”_ ,

The Pitt News, Friday, April 10,1981

Pitt coach Roy Chipman made his recruiting official yesterday

with the signing of five players to National letters-of-intent. _

‘When the Hoffler signing
becomes a reality, Pitt will have one
of its best recruiting years on paper
in a long time. Not since the Panth-
ers inked Larry Harris, Mel Bennett
and Terry Knight in 1975 has a
recruiting class shown so much
promise. But promise is all it is, as
the true test will come on the court
where Chipman will see how much

all the hard recruiting work pays off.

“We’ve been recruiting these play-
ers for a year, and right now I feel
pretty satisfied,” Chipman said.

For_Roy Chipman and his staff,
the hard work has yielded six bas-
ketball players with talent -who‘will
be coming to play at the Field
House. Chipman ﬁnally can allow
himself a srnille.

Shirk’s Antics Go Beyond Gymnastics

By JOHNETTE HOWAR

Pitt News Sports Editor ,

In between events, the dainty
women gymnasts,‘ looking like svelte.
sprites in their form-‘ﬁtting tights
and tidy pulled—back hair-dos
adorned with pretty ribbons, do a
grand goose-step to» the music as
each team moves around the floor
single-file to the next apparatus.

Scurrying to catch up with the rest
of the Pitt team is freshman Lisa
Shirk. Amid all the pomp and gran-
deur ofthe Eastern. Regional Cham-
pionships, the short, muscular Shirk
brings up the rear carrying her blue
nylon parka and wearing bright red’
wool tights, a natty green svveater
and. a blue ‘and gold striped scarf.

out, you have to qualify which way
you intended it. lnonly herfresh:

collegiate gymnasts. For the last
four years, Shirk was in training asa
member of the United St-ates
National team and is a veteran of
international competitions in,
France, Bulgaria, London and
Moscow.

Shirk, a native of Danbury, Con-
necticut, came to Pitt via Hunting-
don Beach California, where she
finished her .last two years of high
school. A stress fracture in her leg
prevented Shirk from competing in
the i980 Olympic trials, where she

The city of Pittsburgh seems to

ketball players just every so often.

. Maurice Lucas, Gus Gerard, Billy »

burgh area who played in the NBA.

Graduating from Pitt this year are
three.more potential NBA‘ candi-‘ V
dates, Sam Clancy, Carlton Never-
son, and Lenny McMillian. Of the 
three, Clancy has the best shot of -.
making it in the pros.

“I don't care where I go, Ijust
want to. prove‘ myself. Before the’

some of the invitational tourna-

  Reagan’s Cuts: Dull, Deadly News for Education-

By PEGGY FERRI

Pitt News Staff Writer

Some may switch off when news-
casters mention Reagan’s budget
cuts; after all, they are not particu-
larly exciting. The cuts, however, are
a subject of controversy because

' they will affect educational, social,

.»,

12/

and medical programs. - _

Reagan proposes to cut $48.6 bil-
lion, from the budget for the fiscal
year 1982, adding more cuts, each
year, while he maintains a $200 bil-
lion military budget.

These are the most important pro-
posed educational cuts in that they
will-directly affect the students.

Social Security: The Administra- /
tion would eliminate the program
i which enables students (18 - 21 years

of age), whose parents are dead,
retired, or disabled, to receive Social
Security benefits. About l000,stu—
dents at Pitt would be affected.
Pell Grants (BEOG): Pell Grants,
/which are primarily for low—income
students, will undergo legislative
changes. The,Administration pro-
poses a $750 self-help requirement
before calculating the student’s first
money award. In other words, the
independent student must come up
with $750 towards his education
first. For the dependent student, it
would be $750 above the parental

contribution. This would save the. _
Administration $9.6 billion from}

1981 to 1986.,

_Guaranteed Student Loans
(GSL): This is more complicated. In
this case, the Administration pro-
poses to eliminate the Student Loan
Marketing Association’s access to
the Federal Financing Bank (FTB).

The Association», set up. as a private. 

corporation, buys these loans using
FFB capital: In- short, local bank
profit maybe reduced ifthis is elimi-

. nated which could then mean less

fr

U

bank money available for loans.
The Administration also proposes

to limit student loan amounts to
“remaining need.” The family finan-

cial needs analysis requirement
would reduce the number of those
eligible.

In addition, the Administration
calls for the elimination of the in-
school interest subsidy on the loans
which is paid on behalf of theibor-

rowers by the government. Thus,_
_ again, shifting the higher coststhat

result from higher interest rates to
the student.

Department of Education Acting
Deputy Assistant Secretary for
News and Information Jeanne Park
said the reasons for the cuts in GSL
is that it has been increasing and this
isjust to hold the growth down, oth-
erwise the loan situation could go on
indefinitely.

“We think that anyone whorreally

wants to go to college won’t be dis-
couraged from going,” Park said.
However,. according to a state-
ment of the'United States Student
Association_, “The Congressional
Budget Office estimates‘ if the inter-

est subsidy were eliminated,_25 per-‘

cent of the students in the GSL
program would drop out. Fifty per-
cent would be eliminated by finan-
ci_al‘need requirement."-’

assigned. But many of us feel that he
probably should have refused to do
it and fought that FAS just can‘t
take a cut like that."

Wion said he hopes the meeting
scheduled for April l4 may include
further reports on the budget cuts,
discussion on the implications of the
cuts or‘ possible faculty workloads,
and possible passage of resolutions
opposing faculty advising.

CAS Dean lrwin Schulman said .

that the original Advising ‘Center
cuts may be changed.

“Originally the Advising Center
was being reduced from 35 advisers
to 20, but there has been a lot of
discussion and negotiation about
that. We are all trying to work some-
thing out that would avoid having to
dismantle the Advising Center,” he
said.

Fred Koloc, Advising Center
director, said the number of faculty
members that would be needed for
each adviser lost depends on how
many hours a faculty member would
be able to be in the Advising Center.

“The advisers work 10 to 17 hours
a week, and each has.a little over I00
students to take care of,” Koloc said.
“I have made some proposals that
would opt for a faculty member to
have 25 students to take care of. We"
would need four faculty members
working five hours a week for every

1., ‘F3?

The CAS professor asid the
Advising Center negotiations are
“one little dribble of information
that was_let out, and it got people
excited, and now there will be a
reconsideration.

“It almost sounds as if the cuts are
made on the basis of who fights and
who doesn’t fight. I don’t think
that's an academic way to do it,” he
said. .

Koloc said he is afraid that many
faculty members would resent being
required to advise students.

“Certainly there are some faculty
members who are always willing to
talk to students and would like to
advise. Between l0 to 20 percent are
in that situation,_," he said. “But l
think that the vast majority would
think it was a pain in the neck.

“They would far more prefer to be
doing things that they consider more
important for their own professional
careers_and would at best do a very
mediocre job.”

Speech professor David Corne-
lius said, “I would regret to see an
increase in the teaching load,
because I think it would be harmful
in the .classroom. Obviously any
increase in administrative work is
going to take away from instruction
and research.”

The CAS professor who chose not
to give his name said budget cuts are
bound to affect tenure.

“it seems to me that the standards
for tenure are already so high that»

they’re almost unattainable," he ;

said. He said the volume of pub-
lished work required for tenure con-
sideration is such ; that ‘ faculty
members can complete that much
scholarship within six or seven
years.

“Unfortunately, that has led a lot
of publications to accept manus-
cripts that they would not take
otherwise. It's a kind of vicious -
circle."

Wion said it has become increas-
ingly difficult for untenured faculty
to get tenure.

“The way it seems to be,develop-
ing is that the administration, for
economic reasons, needs to limit the
number of _ten_ured faculty,” he said. _
One of the ways the administration
can do that, he said, is to make it
harder to get tenure, and one way to
accomplish that is to increase expec-
tations of what it takes to get tenure.

“lt’s an easy way to deny tenure to
faculty members without coming
out and saying that there is financial
indigence," Wion said. “They
haven't been in a position to do that.
For one _reason, as I understand it,
when they actually claim financial
indigence they are then obligated to
demonstrate it.

“And they don't want to do that,
because it would open up a lot of

' information that they want to keep

closed. So it seems that, in fact,
budgetary considerations are aftect-

' ing tenure position, not in an explicit

adviser we lose.”

English‘ department A chairman
Mary Briscoe said the departments
receive their budgets in late May or
early June.

“The only thing that’s going on
now is the predictions for teaching
assistants and the Advising Center.
But otherwise, we have no idea of
what our budget is for next year,”
she said.

Schulman said that although

'0 nothing has really been settled yet,

“We been told that probably by the
end of this week we'll know the
answer."

Psychology department chairman
Frank Colavita said he received a
general outline of his departments
budget cuts, which include a reduc-

' tion in the number ofteaching assist-

ants and “a warning that we’re going

to have to pare back some elective

courses."

“We expected to recruit for four
positions before this budget crunch
to replace people who have left," he
said. “It looks now like we will only
be replacing one of these people.

can strive for and achieve excellence

“We’re still up in the air,”
Drescher said. “We simply can’t pro-
ceed until we find out what the dis-
tributional burdens are going to be
for the individual departments.‘

“If this is a harbinger of things to
come, I think that before too long it
would begin to have a profoundly

demoralizing effect on faculty and p

on research and teaching. It can’t
help but happen."

The CAS professor who
requested anonymity said, “We
really are all concerned about the
well-being of the university. But one
of the biggest problems in the
departments is that we can’t offer the
courses that students really want
and need.”

“lt’s an inefficient use of money," ‘

the professor said. “They are look-
ing for what seems to be small, easy
ways by cutting one position here or
one secretary there and not looking
at the really big issues.

“l don’t think the administration

has been creative or intellectual or A
imaginative in trying to figure ways ,

to save money because it means
looking at their own operation.
“It's always easier and quicker to

_just order an underling to make the

cuts. And as long as there are unde-
rlings_ who will respond, then why
not do it that way‘?

“But they are-running up against
faculty and students who just can't
take it much longer.”

FAS: Sitting in Limbo , Wondering

By FREDERICK BEERS

Pill News Stall Writer

The only thing certain about Pitt's
“serious budget constraints” is- that
nothing is certain.

Sources throughout the univer-
sity, particularly in the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences, are unsure of
where the departments stand and are
virtually in a state of limbo.

The effects ofthe cuts, which must
reduce the FAS budget by $850,000
for fiscal year I982, were first felt in
January. ’

At that time, FAS D_ean Jerome
Rosenberg announced a hiring

freeze for all appointments in FAS,‘-

both temporary and permanent,
including faculty. The only excep-
tions to the freeze, according to
Associate Dean Jack Daniels, were
appointments which were necessary
to “maintain essential parts ofa pro-
gram,” and then "only with the writ;
ten approval of the dean.” A

The next wave was felt at the
March
Rosenberg confirmed that FAS was
being “taxed” $850,000 by the
administration. Perhaps more
shocking to the crowd offaculty and
graduate students, many lining the
aisles, was when Rosenberg
announced that “it is true we will be
reducing the size of the Advising
Center.”

Sources close to the budget pro-
cess indicated that other targeted
areas might include part-time
instructors, teaching assistants and
teaching fellows, departmental
advisers and some doctoral
programs.

Rosenberg recently told The Pitt
News that FAS stands to lose
approximately 12 faculty members,
40 TA/TF positions, and 50 percent
of its part-time instructors.

Most departments are claiming
nothing is final, though, and that
they are still negotiating with the
dean.

When asked whether any cuts
would be made in administrative
positions, Rosenberg claimed that
FAS was alrsasiy..“u!!d?.Fadm‘“?§:

called instead for elimination of

The bulk of the comments,
though, have been resoundingl
against“ the cuts.‘ 4 ‘

Psychology professor James Hol-
land has said that as a result of the
increase in advising duties, faculty
will become less able to do their j obs,
and the university will lose students
as a result. .

  History

By GLENN FREUND
Pitt News Staff Writer

Like fallout from Three Mile
Island, state funding cutbacks have
drifted in from Harrisburg once
more and are already causing dam-
age at every level of the university.

That is why representatives of the
history department such as Profes-

, sors Seymore Drescher, chairper-

son, and Harold Sims, as well as
several graduate students, have been
scrambling around in recent weeks
trying to plug serious leaks in their
department due to the FAS cut-
backs, and keep the damage to a
minimum.

Scrambles to Plug Leaks

Faced with reductions in posi-
tions for teaching ‘assistants, fellow-
ships and their department adviser,
they have been negotiating with
Dean Rosenberg to salvage what
they consider to be the minimum
requirements for quality, both in
research and instruction. Like many
departments, they find themselves
squeezed to the bare bone. After
asking for more, they have been
alloted less. Then it becomes a game
of fitting square pegs into (too few)
round holes.

Yet below the surface ofa depart-
ment that has been heavily hit with
the cuts in terms of teaching reduc-
tions, there are other fundamental
changes that make it a microcosm of

burdens other departments can

expect to face in the near future. Due
to a tightening of belts, as this profile
shows, many faculty and TA/ TF’w
will have heavier work loads and less
time for research. As a result, this
and other departments will have a
difficult time maintaining the qual-
ity of instruction and other services
to undergraduates that they would
like to provide.

Due to the dismantling of the
advising center, Soviet history Pro-
fessor Bill Chase is about to find
himself in a new-role of adviser, for
which he feels relatively unqualified,
and which will take time away from
research and class preparation.

“Students are gonna get burned,"
said Chase. “I can tell students what
courses are available, but  can’t tell
students in law and pre-med what’s
important. I don't know more than
what’s in the catalog. Advisers can
keep track of students in terms of
fulfilling their programs. Some
faculty are better advisers than oth-
ers. It's a grab bag.

“I don’t say this through malice,"
he said. “lt’s a lack ofunderstanding
of what people need. It bothers me a
lot.” »

Chase is bewildered that,
although the department “got a
glowing report" in last year’s evalua-
tion, it is receiving less than its min-
imum request, and is shouldered
with more work.

‘‘It raises the question of what the
future quality of education will be,"
he said. “The more you overburden
people, the less time they have to
devote to students. The hours to
devote to. teaching and research
means preparation time has to be
taken out. Research is importantuat
this university."

“lt‘s a point of diminishing
return,” said Chase. “You sacrifice
the long-ra_ngc quality of education.
Everyone is spread too thin."

Chase added that he is concerned
that the cuts will continue next year.

One way Dean Rosenberg has
found to economize on funding
reaching assistants and teaching fel-
lowships, other than by eliminating
TA/TF-ships, is to require more
work out of them, according to Pro-
fessor Harry Sims.

“He didn‘t just cut the budget,"
said Sims. “He changed the work
rules to get 20 percent more work
out of TAs and TF5. lt's a devalua-
tion of good students. lt’s redefining
the workload, leading to an over-
load. They will have to do more
work to get the/"same amount of

money.”
Sims said that “the dean is correct

insofar as the rule change means
an enforcement of the existing rules
on paper."

He said that as a result of“the new
regime,” TAs will have to grade two
courses instead of one,-for example.

“Its a crisis for graduate stu-
dents," he said.

This redeﬁnition of the work rules
means that a graduate student like
Paul LeBlanc, who teaches a U.S.
history course, will have to take on
additional work in the fall in order
to keep his position.

“The outlook is that people teach-
ing a whole course will only count as
three—fourths of a position, while a
TA with recitation sections gets a
full position," said LeBlanc.

“I think it’s -crazy," he said.
“Someone teaching is‘ doing more
work plus a full course load.”

‘‘It’s a new wrinkle. We're in the
process of working it outrln a sense,
we're taking on an added work load.
There was a certain flexibility
before. Now it‘s been eliminated.”

LeBlanc said he will have to teach
a full course plus do something else,
such as grade ‘a class or handling a
recitation section, meaning less time
for helping students in writing skills

and other special services he has -

done in the past.

‘‘I think these cuts are not only
hurting graduate students, TAs or
TF5,” said LeBlanc, “but hurting
outside students who need that kind
of position. It hurts the department
as a whole because they can’t bring
in more people and it’s hurting
undergraduates because there are
fewer people to handle classes and
less attention. Its a detriment to the
quality of education.”

LeBlanc also thinks that “the
absence _of a union encourages
administrators and legislators to go
along the line of least resistance
when it comes to budget cuts. lt’s

necessary to build counter-pressure

through university, faculty and stu-
dent pressure. This is ultimately how
we’re going to save education at
Pitt.” ' —

LeBlanc said he is concerned that
the decision-making process is too

. _ private: ‘‘I’d like to see the adminis-

tration open its boks,and'be a little
moreopen about its decisions.” . '
ln the final analysis, budget cuts

ryone in an equitable way. Everyone

_ gets screwed. And given all indica-

tions, as Hal Sims said, “This is only
‘the beginning Wait ‘til next year."

Tuition Hikes Hit Out-of- State Students Hardest

By LINDA MILLER

Pill News Staff Wriler

The effects of rising costs and pro-
posed cutbacks in federal education
funding will hit Pitt‘s population of
foreign and out-of-state students the
hardest. A

While it is definite that tuition will
increase next fall, the exact amount
of this increase is unknown. Cur-
rently, both foreign and out-of-state
undergraduate students pay $3,580 a
year in tuition, or double the tuition
that in-state students pay.

There are approximately I400
foreign students attending Pitt.
These students are either sponsored
by their country or personally, and
do not receive any type of aid from
the university.

The director of lnternational Stu-
dent Affairs, Ralph Morrison, esti-
mated that foreign students
contribute over $10 millionvannually
to Pitt’s budget and over $8 million
to the Oakland community in the

forms of scholarships, Basic Educa-

National Direct Student Loans and

Despit the aid from the university,

"a number of Pitt's out-of-state stu-
dents are starting to have ﬁnancial
woes about next fall.

One undergraduate from Virginia

means does it cover the cost.” She
also added that her work study job
cuts into her studying, but she needs
the money for spring term.

President Reagan’s proposal to
cut back on student loans and social
security benefits has an undergradu-
ate from New York concerned.

“If I were a freshman, I would
seriously consider transferring in-
state because of the tuition," he
added, “but at this point, l’d lose too
many credits.”

Another undergraduate from
Ohio is worried about the tuition
hike, but indicated, like a number of
other out-of-state students did, she
would stay at Pitt because of “the
city environment and the varied
opportunities offered here.”

She added, however, that she will
go to graduate school in Ohio

because cost is figured into her

future.‘ ' V

tuition is higher and the academic
work is more demanding, the finan-

University  

Commitments

lnﬁation...budget cuts...federal spending; any student
caught in the maze of federal, state and university budget
crises is apt to be confused. On every level there_is uncer-
tainty about what will be cut and why. There are questions
about who is making the budget decisions. But most of all,
there is a feeling of helplessness, an inability to comprehend
why information is so vague and rationalizations are so
contradictory.

Perhaps we are searching in the wrong directions. Perhaps
we are assessing blame and pointing ﬁngers when what really
needs to be done is to accept what is inﬂexible and then work
from there. A

A case in point: state appropriations. Obviously, every
effort must be made to convince legislators of the need for

increased funding. Students shouldbecorne involved in the

student lobbying group and should register to vote. The

necessity of the Chancellor's budget presentation cannot be

ignored. But if the money iust is H0! thcfe. ’ and
inflation remains a culprit that we cannot control, then the
screaming and the accusations must stop for a time while a
search for alternatives begins. _

Theiissue is one of priorities. lf the Faculty of Arts and
Sciences is indeed the heart of the university,’will the univer-
sity lose more than it will gain by cutting its budget? Pitt is-
undoubtedly heading toward a confrontation between its
ﬁscal responsibilites and its aspirations and commitment to
education. ’ -

,"_f_iie eventual outcome of the plight of the FAS is likely to
' indicate 7 the direction Pitt will take in striking the balance
between finances and education. The degree of depth which
Pitt employs in determining alternative cuts will also indi-
cate how sincere the university really is about offering stu-
_ dents a quality education.

Why information is difficult to comeby at this point is
unclear. Negotiations may be taking place between Dean
Rosenberg and various departments, and their outcome is
uncertain. lt is hard for Pitt students to ignore the lessons of
the past however; a likely possibility is that FAS cuts, like
most other controversial decisions made by Pitt, will occur
during the summer months when most students are away.

For the Pitt administration to re-establish the legitimacy
of its commitment to qualify education, if such a commit-

_ merit exists, then it must ﬁrst, deal with responsibly with the
budget situation at hand by’ cutting the “inessentiais'*t_nai
various faculty claim exist. Faculty should be dealt with
honestly: the secrecy and witholding.of information sur-
rounding the FA-S cuts results in a distrust ofadministration
motives. . -

And ﬁnally, priorities. The reality of dollars and cents is
always present, but how much can we afford to lose before

. we are merely existing and no longer striving to provide the
best education possible? The greatest loss we face is the loss
of the commitment to greatness that Pitt once held.

Expanding the Concept of Advising

By FRED KOLOC

Advising Center Director

It has become very apparent to me
in recent days that misconceptions
about academic advising abound
among students, faculty and admin-
istrators alike——-the most common
of which is that academic advising
means nothing more than outlining

requirements for whatever program .

a student is pursuing and signing
registration forms. During the past
dozen years, I have: talked about
advising with at least a thousand
people—freshmen,sophomores,
juniors and sen_iors, "students satis-
ﬁed and dissatisﬁed, parents, faculty
members, graduate students reflect-
ing on their own experiences with
advisers, and numerous candidates
for advising positions. l have tried to
gather as many ideas, hints and sug-
gestions as possible about good
advising, and to understand what
students really want, expect and
hope for from an academic advisor,
and what graduates wish they had
gotten from advising while they were
in school. From these many discus-.
sions and experiences, we in‘ the
Advising Center have evolved ‘and
tried to implement a conception of
academic advising that far outpaces
the view of advising as simply regis-
tering students. i A
In our view, advising should be an
active teaching process, the aim of
which is to help each student take
fulladvantage of his or her educa-
tion and educational opportunities.
Good advising involves a great deal

of: (l)orienting students to the voca- expanded concept of advising. bf‘-Came N‘-995535’ l0 eXP3“d ti“? Size _

bulary, assumptions and values of

tional benefits available to them by
helping them to better understand
themselves and to learn to use the
resouces of an educational institu-
tion to meet their special educa-
tional needs and aspirations.”
Crockett specifically states that
selection of courses and scheduling
of classes shouldinot constitute more
than 20 to 25 percent of the advising
process; the other 75 to 80 percent
should be taken up with discussions
about values, aspirations, careers,
education, being a student, reactions
to classes and teachers, alternatives,
options, majors and programs, etc.
Needless to say, good advising
takes time. In a year, CAS advisers
try to see each of their students for
minimum of three hours. We require
at least two half-hour appointments
each term—~one for advising and one
for registration——for each student,
but over 40 percent of our students
see their adviser three or more times
per term. Advising is most definitely
not done only during registration
periods! This fact seems extravagant
to most faculty, and many students,
too, but if freshmen- and
sophomore-level advising is done at
all properly, this amount of time is
absolutely necessary to help stu-
dents learn the ropes, make deci-
sions, formulate plans, assess
progress, select courses, discuss
options and otherwise engage them-
selves in their educations.
Regardless of who does advising
- on this campus next year and in the
future, every -adviser .and- stiudent
should be dedicated to _this

Every adviser should be willing to
deliver genuine advising and every
student should insist on receiving it.

AAUP

Makes
Statement

The collegial governance of a uni-
versity takes the view that the faculty
of the university are the ofﬁcersof
the university and responsible for
establishing the academic policy of
the university.

The chancellor has stated on
numerous occasions that he believes
in collegial governance. A I vast
senate apparatus has been created
over the past decade in which fully

10 percent of the faculty participate
directly in one form or another.

ln spite of this, the chief faculty
complaint that one hears aside from
economic issues are complaints
about the governance of the univer-
sity and lack of faculty participation
in university decision making.

How does one reconcile this gap-

between formal commitment and
_ faculty perception?
. To understand how this gap arose
.‘ one must look into the recent history
of the university. A _
Beginning in the sixties, the uni-
eversityunderwent enormous growth

‘both in s_ize and complexity. lt no r

longer was possible to run the uni-
versity with a small group of admin-
istrators with vague .but effective
channels of communications. It

the university, and to thegoals and
definitions of a liberal education, (2).
exploring all the opportunities and
options available at the university,
(3) exploring career and educational
goals, (4) trying to teach students to
do all the things most people, espe-
cially faculty, assume _they already
know how to do (i.e. ‘how to be good,
students, how to make dec-isioris,
and how to ﬁnd and use necessary
information, and (5) following up,
recording and minitoring students‘
progress. Good advising many times
also involves challenging ‘students’;
attitudes, assumptions, and beliefs
and trying to change them to j‘inore_
mature and educated ones_. All these
things must be addressed before, I
during and after the "selection of A
courses and a majorfor that very

selection ‘to be meaningful. With
what other view of advising could
the Provost’s_ Task Force on Student °
Retention report to him, “Virtually
all studies point, as the key to stu-”
dent retention, to the functions of"
advising, both personal and aca-
demic. Advising emerges as the criti-
cal force in student retention more
often than any single factor."

Lest it be thought that we have
developed a lavish and unrealistic
view of advising, I would like to‘
quote Mr. David Crockett, vice—
president of Educational Programs
and Services for the American»Col-
lege Testing Service, a man nation-
ally prominent in advising and
perhaps the one man in the United
States who knows [mostabout it.

By PHILIP WION

President, Pill Professional Union

In talking with our colleagues
about the advantages and possible
disadvantages of collective bargain-
ing for faculty, we in the Pitt Profes-
sional Union have found that certain
questions emerge with considerable
frequency. In what follows, we
would like to provide brief answers
to some of these questions.

I . Won ’t collective bargaining create
an adversary relationship between
faculty and administration?

Not necessarily. University facul-
ties and administrations have many
interests in common; but like any

other groups ofemployees. they also.

have some_ interests that may
diverge. Collective bargaining estab-
lishes an orderly process by means of
which the faculty and the adminis-
tration can come to agreement upon
the terms and conditions under
which the faculty will work for a set
period of time.

Whether the relationship between
faculty’ and administration is
“adversarial" or cooperative and
mutually respectful depends upon
the attitudes and behavior of the
people involved. Many colleges and
universities without contracts are
among the most “adversarial” in
their relations between faculty and
ad_ministrators; on the other hand,
many institutions with bargaining
have excellent faculty-admini
stration relationships.

“Collegial" relationships, by the
way, according to Webster's, are
“marked by power or authority
vested equally in each of a.-number of

i colleagues."

2. Doesn 't unionization mean the
faculty will be subject to dictation by

, outside labor forces?

No. The Pitt Professional Union
(has autonomy over its own policies
and procedures. The organizations
with which we have chosen to affil-
iate offer expertise and financial and

other kinds of support. But they.

would have no control over the kind
of contract the faculty would nego-
tiate with the University.

The union’s financial structure
indicates this independence. Dues

are sent not to some national office
but to the union's local treasurer,
who then forwards “per capita” pay-
ments to the various labor groups-
the American Federation of
teachers, Pennsylvania Federation
of Teachers, Pennsylvania AFL-
CIO, Allegheny County Labor
Council—with which the union is
affiliated.

3. Won't collective bargaining mean
faculty members will be forced to
ioin the union?

No. The constitution of the Pitt
Professional Union not only does

not require faculty to join the union.

when they have collective bargain-
ing; it gives them the right to vote for
or against ratification of the first
contract, whether they are union
members or not. (Voting on subse-

quent contracts, however, would be

limited to those faculty willing not
just to benefit from the union’s
efforts but to support those efforts
by becomeing dues-paying
members.— _
Pennsylvania law does not permit
public employees to negotiate a
“union shop" provision that would
require everyone in the bargaining
unit to join the union. However, the
ability of the union to achieve the
faculty's goals through bargaining
depends upon its collective strength,
which is most obviously .demon—
strated by the size of the'union‘s
membership."

4. Won 't collective bargaining mean
the faculty will have to go on strike?

No. Higher education contracts
typically include a clause prohibit-
ing strikes or lockouts for the dura-
tion of the contract. Public
employee strikes are legal underl
Pennsylvania’s Act’ 195 as a last

resort when an impasse has been _.

reached in the talks leading to a con-
tract. A strike is never simply

“called" by theunion leadership but
is decided upon by a vote of the
membership.

What has occurred is an almost

heart of the present frustration-
The constant fiscal pressure
demanded tighter financial control,
a large expansion of all financial
control activities and a shrinkage in
the academic administration per-

ment of the deans of humanities,
natural sciences and social sciences

What has happened in ensuing
years is that as the fiscal" pressure
mounted, the academic administra-
tion became weaker'both in inﬂu-
ence and numbers. Fiscal criteria
increasingly became the ‘guiding
force in determing academic policies
with less and less participation of the
faculty, chairman and cleans. In fact,
in the process, many of the deans
have become budget administrators
and have let their academic func-
tions wither. '
” Key budget decisions are made in
a mysterious manner. The AAUP
could not find any senate officer or
university officers who claimed to

i know how budgetary priorities were

it clear,’ however, that many deans
do not participate in thisprocess and
certainly no chairmen do. There
does not exist any channel of com-

;nel of communication of the faculty
through their chairman, through the
deans, to the provost, to the highest
councils of the university. To put the
matter bluntly, the faculty has no
idea. what the objectives and priori-
ties of the university are and the
deans are scarcely better informed.

What is needed contrary to _most
popular sentiment is not less admin-
istration but better administration.
The faculty senate cannot compen-
sate for fundamental weaknesses in
the university decision-making pro-
cess. The senate‘ has a proper and
legitimate role but much-of its ener-
gies are dissipated in dealing with
matters that it has neither the infor-
mation nor staff to handle effec-
tively. The senate must .concentrate
its energies on establishing academic
policy and priorities_Vand see that
these are translated in to budgetary
allocations and administrative

‘decisions. ’ ‘

Theimajor responsibility for res-
toring collegiality‘ to the university
however lies with a. major reform. in
the administration, to restore the
two-way flow of information so that
the administration is better
informed of the faculty's views and
the faculty isbetter informed of the
alternatives open to the administra-
tion. The presentvconsideration of
important issues ‘on a piecemeal
basis forces the faculty often into an

unconstructive role of ‘opposing-

reduction in programs without

decision, further protects the rights
of tenured and non-tenured alike.

A strong union with collective
bargaining would give Pitt new
allies, new channels, and new
“clout” for persuading the governor
and the legislature to increase their
support for the University and for
higher education in general.

continued. from page eleven ._........ _

While it is not the intention of this
statement to present a plan of
reform, certain problems are suffi-
ciently salient as
comment.

‘ One, it is imperative that chair-

men meet regularly with their facul- _

ties to solicit their views and inform
them of university policies that
effect them and the university as a
whole. “

Two, it is equally important that
the deans meet collectively with their
chairmen to formulate policies for
their schools. . -

And clearly it is important that
the chancellor and provost meet col-
lectively with their deans
departmental heads both to be
informed of collegial concerns and
to inform the faculty of the policy
alternatives available and perhaps to

make themselves available to they A’

consideration of new alternatives.

.Furthermore, it is imperative that ' ,

the Office of the Provost be strengh-

cried and authority delegated". The -A 5 i -

provost is the chief »representative of

the academic community _in the high" I . ;i’
. councils of the university and_ {he

must be prepared to presentithe

viewpoint of the faculty in these .
councils. To do this he must be,‘ _
informed of the faculty's views by his ~ - — '
‘deans. In some cases, this, at pres- j ' if

circumstances a dean surrenders his ‘ r A C

State-Relate,  Question of Give and Take

By SETH LUBOVE

August 23, I966 was almost like
any other summer day at the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh.

Dave Hart, the new Panther foot-

ball coach was putting his team
through summer drills and scrim-
mages,‘ ambitious students and
‘entering freshmen were preparing
for another academic year, faculty
and staff were reluctantly returning
from their vacations...and Pitt
became state-related.

On that date, almost a decade and
a half ago, in a ornate room in the
Cathedral of Learning, Gov. Wil-
liam Scranton signed into law the
bill making Pitt one of the Com-
monwealth of Pennsylvania's four
state-related universities. it wasn’t a
very ceremonious ceremony; no fire-
works, marching bands and singing
of the alma mater—just Pittsburgh
Mayor Joseph Barr, acting Pitt
Chancellor David Kurtzman, State
Representative K. Lerov Irvis, and a
few other public figures in Pitts-
burgh to watch the bill signing and
get their picture taken.

The Pitt News, concluding a spe-
cial story detailing the process lead-
ing > up ‘to Pitt becoming
state-related, wrote:

about the school losing its cosmop-

appropriations will ever even get to
Pitt.

L In .a process where receiving
appropriations from the state is as
much as distinctly organized politi-
cal process as it is a method of sup-
plementing Pitt’s budget,
uncertainty about the final outcome
is more often the rule than the excep-
tion. Partisan politics, especially in
this year’s conservative Republican
controlled administration and
Legislature, promises to play a cru-
cial role in Pitt’s fight to receive its
FY 81-82 stae appropriations.

And so, the general consensus in
state government—-at least from the
Democratic or minority view-—is
that its the Republicans’responsibil-
ity to fashion and pass Gov. Dick
Thornburgh’s proposed $12.6 bil-
lion state budget, including Pitt’s
appropriations contained in the
non—preferred items.

“I think that that’s the governor’s
responsibility,” said Richard Willey,
senior financial advisor to the House
Democratic Appropriations Com-

"mittee. “Since we have a Republican

governor and a Republican Senate
and a Republican House, I think
that it’s their responsibility. its not
necessarily the miority’s responsibil-
ity to help him...ln essence, if the
governor wants the Democratic or
minority caucus to assume his lead-
ership, fine, O.K., let's talk about

that. But he certainly has abdicated '

his leadership responsibility I would
think, as far as the budget process
goes..”

Special Report
Reagan’s

By PEGGY FERRI

Pitt News Stall Writer

in Reagan’s budget, a 281 page
volume entitled Americas New
Beginning: A Program For Eco-
nomic Recovery, he states, “We can
no longer afford things just because
we think ofthem." Judging from the
public‘s response, although there is
concentrated opposition to Rea-
gan’s cuts in social, educational, and
medical programs, there is still afor-
midable number of people who sup-
port the proposed cuts.

What are the priorities of the
budget and what is the assessment of

‘the public‘s attitude to Reagan’s

budget cuts?

Congressional Administrative
Assistant Jonathan Delano, speak-
ing for Congressman Doug
Walgren, said the mail he’s received
isi2 to l in favor of the budget.

“We polled our district which con-

sists of l70,000 residents, "and of"

those who responded, 65 .percent

said Congress should enact the

budget.” He continued to relate the
following figures: 57 percent in favor
of welfare reduction, 82 percent said
cut Guaranteed Student Loans
(GSL), and 73 percent would cut
student Social Security Benefits.

“We’ve gotten very few letters in
support of food stamps and student
loans,” Delano said, “Our mail is
part of the input to our decision
making, but it's not the bottom line.

“I think it is fair to say that the
very poor will not be affected a great
deal,” Delano said.

“The hardest thing for us to know
is if people appreciate the pain asso-
ciated with these budget cuts,” he
said. “Do the 82 percent who favor
all cutbacks understand them?"

The effect on students, he
explained, is that cuts will change
the composition ofthe student body,
leaving the very rich and the very
poor, but missing the middle class.

“Of Reagan's military budget of
$200 billion,” Delano said, “just one
percent would maintain GSL and
most social prog_rams._."

0lE§

Press secretary for Senator Arlen
Specter, Dan Mcl(enna, supplied
the following views.

“Senator Specter believes Rea-
gan's budget has to be passed in
order to reduce inflation, but he is
concerned.”

“We receive mail 4 to l in favor of
the cuts," McKenna said. “Specter is
especially concerned about Con-
rail.” He added, “They haven‘t heard
much about the Social Programs
yet." ' ‘

Walter Rybeck, special assistant
to Congressman Bill Coyne, spoke
about budget priorities and public
response.

Accoring to Dr.‘ Michael John-
ston of Pitt’s, Political Science

Department, “A majority ofthe peo—.

ple agree we need a smaller federal
deficit, but they say, ‘Don’t cut “my
program.’

“lt’s the ‘backyard principle,”
Johnston explained. “Leave what’s
in my backyard alone, but whatever
you do with other people’s back-

_yards is okay.”

sir I: lit)  1; 0 M

Johnston said the public really

doesn’t have a clear picture of what"

the cuts entail. “They will actually
lose what they think they’re gaining.

“The middle class really has a
stake in this and l think the budget
cuts will be quite a surprise.

“Reagan has a budget that goes on
what he perceives as causing pov-
erty,” Johnston said.

“People think that others on Wei-
fare are just sitting around and
watching TV and eating frozen piz-
zas instead of looking for work and
that’s not true.”

However, Cliff Shannon, speak-
ing for Senator Heinz, says that we
shouldiput it all into perspective.

“Locally, we have the same prob-
lems that most of the Northeast
has,” he said, “and that’s that we
need more from D.C. than we send
in. Pittsburgh doesn’t suffer to the
extent of New York. Our forecasts
for our industry look good."

He admits there will be fewer dol-

IT AGAIN. ‘f

To a generation raised on rock, the spirit of stereo is a band called REO Speedwagon.

After a_ decade on the road, on the radio, on TV and on the turntable, alter the years of

platinum and gold, this classic band has busted out with its biggest hit ever. lt,should
come as no surprise. Hi Infidelity is in the great tradition of REO Speedwagon.
A well-earned name in the best game there is.

_ “The limits on student loans are

“As for the universities closing,’we

Urban League disagrees. C

“Reagan is wrong if he thinks he
has a mandate,” Cohen said.,“He
was also very shrewd to keep his
mouth shut so we had-no idea what
he wanted to cut.

“l don’t know if those in opposi-
tion can affect the climate where .
only Reaganite voices havei been
heard. The opposition is not organ-
ized; we were stunned,” Cohen said.

“People are gearing up,” he said,
“but a lot feel that the situation is
hopeless, especially with a Re_publi- .

THEARTS

Reagan Cuts for theArts: Unleash ‘Genius’

By J.D. KLEINKE

Pill News Entertainment Editor

In his first televised address, Pres-
ident Reagan told the nation his
primary objective is to “restore the
energy ofAmerican men and women
to produce and create, and to
unleash the genius of the American
people.

And what better way can the pres-
ident accomplish this than to cut the

National Endowment for the Arts
and Humanities in half‘? Reagan has
proposed to slash the funds granted
to museums, publicitelevision and
the performing arts by 50 percent.

Conducive to American creativ-
ity? Perhaps there is a missing link in
the president’s chain of logic.

Reagan insists that the financial
slack will quickly be picked up by
what he calls “private philan-
thropy.” Carnegie lnstitute is a go.od
example. Nine-tenths of its funding
comes from private business. The
remaining I0 percent will easily be
replaced with a little more diligent
solicitation of private funds on the
lnstitute’s part. _

Consider for a moment the ballet,
the symphony and the larger theat-

 ers on the Pittsburgh area. They too

will presumably by supported by the
larger contributions businesses will
graciously hand out. Especially after
Reagan cures the recession. How-‘
ever, we arrive at two minor points
the president has most likely
overlooked. -

First, contributions from private
corporations and wealthy citizens
were at an all-time high in 1979.
‘Apparently, donations are at a max-
_imum. Keep in mind the statistics
are somewhat loaded; inﬂation
(which Reagan will alsocure) tends
to bloat figures for comparison.’ But

the point is the same. Contributions
from the private sector are huge, and
will never keep proportionately
abreast with the impact of the cuts.
Corporations doubt they could sub-
stantially increase their “philan-
thropic giving” that much.

Second, many of the larger recip-
ients of NEA grants are on the
challenge-grant program. Every dol-
lar the federal government puts up
to support an arts program must be
matched by a corporation for that
group to receive the grant. In this
way, the NEA serves both as a seal of
approval for worthv arts groups and
a stimulus for private fund-raising.’
The logic that follows_is simple. The
NBA moneylevaporates, and so do
the matching funds. And the arts are
hit twice as hard.

The big arts organizations’, that is.
The smaller ones do not stand a
chance. Take for examplethe Pitts-
burgh Metropolitan Stage Com-
pany, a small, innovative and
thriving group of dedicated artists.
Like all small theaters, the Company
is surviving primarily on its wits and
its love for the art.

But when its" federal money, its
lifeblood, is severly cut back, the
organization is finished. The larger
theater in town, The Pittsburgh

The Pittsburgh Ballet Theater, even with its large endowment
from local corporations, may suffer severely from the proposed

cuts in the NEA.

Public Theater, will probably sur-
vive the cuts. But the smaller theat-
ers (and the smaller dance
companies) are in serious trouble.

Contrary to popluar belief, most

and the Laboratory Theaters in any

American city. .

l-n simpler days, these theaters
were supported by moneyed eccent-

thieves. Hardly feasible in the eight-
ies. Moneyed eccentrics warft their

grams, political parties pay too ‘ 2

about the arts, and all thieves theo-

performing arts. U.S. Steel and
Westinghouse want their display ads
in the 40-page glossys of the Sym-
phony, ballet and large theater pro-
ductions, not the leaflets of the
smallertheaters.

Like the indispensable artist-in-
education program that will be elim-
inated under the proposed cuts, the
small, experimental theaters and
dance companies are in serious
jeopardy.

Thus we arrive at the shape of
things to come. These small, strug-
gling organizations are the infants of

p the arts. Cut them away, and we may

very well find ourselves without the
adult versions in a quarter of a cen-
tury. That is how it works with the
arts:" no experimentation today, no

norm tomorrow.

And the value of the arts should
never, ever be underestimated by the
president. or any other American
citizen. The arts are a lasting reflec-
tion of our people, a sublimation of
our anger, an expression ofour emo-
tions. The arts are a timeless celebra-
tion of our humanity. g

But most importantly-, the arts are
a springboard for social change.
Through them, we become painfully
aware of society‘s built-in pitfalls.
We communicate with our past and
ourselves through Shakespeare and
others. We examine our fantasies
through dance.

Temporary Tax
Increase Debate

At issue this year are two tempor-
ary tax increases SL ieduled to expire
Dec. 3 l. The increaa rs were imposed
initially in l977 by Gov. Milton
Shapp, a Demon "at, and ‘are
expected to produce pproximately
$250 million in rever. es for FY 8!-
82. But when the to-...-.| amount of
appropriations recomn :nded by the
governor for Penn-Sta; Pitt, and
Temple, all state-related, totals
$29l.5 million, the loss of revenues
could cause even less money to be
appropriated to the schools.

The bill, which was released for
floor debate by the Senate Finance
Committee and failed to pass bv one
vote Tuesday, would retain the per-
sonal income tax at 2.2 percent and
the corporate income tax at l0.5 per-
cent. If the bill fails to pass, then the

T "_°19eoBeeramwea_’

C0nt’dfr0m page 12

taxes would return to their I977 lev-
els of 2 percent for the personal
income tax and 9.5 percent for the
corporate income tax.
in addition, if the bill fails to pass
there will be “debacle” in the state
according to one leading legislator.
There will be “debacle throughout
the Commonwealth of Pennsylva-
nia. Everything will be cut, right
through the budget," predicted
Senator Richard Tilghman (R-
Delaware, Montogomery), majority
chairman of the Senate Appropria-
tions Committee.

Pitt’s Appropriations
Request

Pitt requested -$83,994,700 in

by Millerﬁrewing  Milwaukee. Wis:

 

commonwealth support for FY 8|-
82. an increase ofapproximately $l3
million or 18.2 percent over last
year‘s appropriation of $71.1
million.

But the governor has recom-
mended in his budget that Pitt
receive $74,553,000, an increase of
4.9 percent over last year’s
appropriation. A

Despite the difference in the
amount Pitt would like to receive
and the amount the governor recom-
mended, Pitt Chancellor Wesley
Posvar didn't blame the governor
for the discrepancy.

During the budget hearing, one
legislator suggested that Pitt’s
instructors attempt to increase their
productivity by teaching additional
hours duringtheweek.

“lfthey each take two more hours
they would‘nt have to hire any addi-
tional teachers and they could
reduce their forces by attrition,”said
Rep. Carmel Sirianni (R-
Susquehanna), reflecting on the
comments she made at the hearing.

“I think that the time has come
when everybody has to bite the
bullet, and that means in every
department ofthe state, whichnatu-

rally includes education. We have 7

found with the state colleges and the
state-related colleges that their
teachers are getting more money
than the ivy League schools. We
thought maybe they ought to have a
couple more hours teaching per
week.” ,

Penn State, Pitt and Temple cur-
rently rank among the top five pub-
lic universities that charge -the high-
est tuition and fees in the country.

Earl Brown, executive director of
the house Appropriations Commit-
tee, offered this analysis of Pitt’s
recommended appropriations:

“lt’s sufficient as long as theylput
the tuition up a little bit. I’m sure,
were 1 am sitting at Pift, l’d wish it
were more, but in relation to the rest
of the budget’ 1 think they were
treated just as equitably as all of the
other higher education institutions."

Which, when taken in context
with the whole ofthe appropriations
process, reflects the sentiment of
most members of the state
government. 0

Spikers Clash with Army; Robbins C

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Sports Writer

As the season winds down to the
home stretch, the Pitt Panther vol-
leyball team is looking forward to
continuing their strong surge
towards the top of Eastern
volleyball.

The Panthers are coming off a
strong showing at George Mason
University last weekend, where they
won in a league match Friday and
won the George Mason lnvitational
on Saturday to cap a grueling 23-
game stint. The tournament win was
the second first-place tournament
showing in two weeks for the Panth-
ers, who face Army tomorrow at
Trees Hall.

The entire Pitt team is looking at
the Army match as a stepping stone
to next week’s competition against
Penn State, the East’s‘No. l team, at
State College, and away against a
tough East Stroudsburg team. Fol-
lowing those matches, the Panthers
will travel back to Penn State on
April 25-26 for the Eastern Regional
Championships. There Pitt will be
fighting to knock off Per'm'State or
No. 2 Rutgers-Newark and capture
a higher ranking than last year’s
third-place finish.

“We’ve decided that the way that

we could win Easterns or take.

second-place is if we surprise those
other teams andjump on them quick
and take over,” said Pitt’s Barry
Goldberg. “We think that Penn
State and Rutgers will be so worried
about each other that they won’t be
so aware of us. That’s when we’ll try
to catch them off-guard, and I think
we can do it.”

Birds in East, Royal

The St. Louis Cardinals did a lot .

of wheeling and dealing in the off
season. A lot of familiar faces are
gone (Ted Simmons, Ken Reitz and
Pete Vuckovich). They have added
people like Sixto Lezcano and Bruce
Sutter.

Right now they are a difficult
team to read. Knowing what the
three teams above them have, it
would appear safe to say the Cards
might challenge only if the new play-
ers provide more of an impact than
the ones‘ whom they replaced did.

Some outstanding players are left
from the old regime, first baseman
Keith Hernandez and‘ shortstop
Gary Templeton. Do not forget the
silent one, outﬁelder George Hen-'
drick who can swing the wedge. Still,

Looking tdward Army tomorrow
afternoon, Pitt senior Scott Robbins
has mixed emotions about the
match, which will be the final home
match of his career.

“As all senior athletes face their
final home match on-the court or the
field or in the pool, it’s hard to face,”

They lack power and their pitch-
ing staff lacks depth, except for relief
ace Neil Allen. The trade’ of Steve
Henderson to Chicago for feast or

Robbins Proﬁts From Experience

By AN NA ARLOTTA

Pitt News Sports Writer

When the Panther spikers wind
down their home season tomorrow
against Army senior Scott Robbins
will say goodbye to his playing days
at Pitt. Robbins has been a member
of the Pitt squad since the birth of
the team in 1979. In that year he

-came to the Panthers from Kellogg

Junior College and has been a stari-
dout on the court ever since.
Robbins sports the‘ most playing
experience of any of his teammates
as the veteran on a young Pitt team.
With an All-American volleyball
player for a father and instructor,
Robbins began playing the game at a
young age and has used his expe-
rience successfully to fit in the
Panther game plan for three years.
“I gained a great deal of knowl-
edge through my experiences of
playing volleyball ‘with the USVBA
(United States Volleyball Associa-
tion) teams when l was younger,”

. said Robbins, “I learned a lot from

my father, because he helped me
with the techniques of the game. I
was brought up on different levels of

the game until l was good enough to

play on one of his teams with a lot of
older players." ‘

Ironically, Robbins didn't partici-
pate in highitschool ball because his
Lahser High School in Northern
Detroit didn’t have a team. So, with
a desire tocontinue improving .his
skills and play the game, Robbins
gained experience with the YMCA

“Western Pennsylvania was the
first area that I had ever heard of
having organized men’s volleyball
on the high school level,” said Rob-
bins. “We didn’t in Michigan so I
played on club teams and coached
the junior varsity girls’ team in my
high school. I have been around it
for so long with my father that I
gained a good general know1edge
about the game and learned the fine
techniques that are used in it. I
believed at that time that I still had
to be actively involved in the sport
even though there was no high ‘
school squad. I thought thatl could‘
help out in other ways.” _

Upon going to Kellogg, Robbins
met up with a man that he credits a
great deal of his volleyball progress
to. Mick Haley, who had played

‘ with Robbins’ father, coached a

and USVBA teams until his start at .

Robbins. “He’s what took me to

Robbins-

“At Kellogg we had a highly
advanced training program. Every-
thing was so serious,” said Robbins.
“Here we have such a program with
a serious attitude, but the personnel
that we are working with makes for a
more relaxed environment."

After playing all three years for
the Panthers as a varsity athlete,
Robbins is at a point that he can be
considered an expert on the sport at
Pitt. He has been able to both see
and be a part of the building block of
men’s volleyball on the collegiate
level in Pittsburgh.

“The program is continually gain-
ing more and more Eastern recogni-
tion in my three years here," said
Robbins. “I foresee in the near
future that we will be seen nationally
too. The program is very established
now and the recruiting is great. Part
of the building has been to ﬁll the
gaps with new, quality players that

will become the nucleus for the
future. That has been done
successfully."

Coach Ray Reilly looks at this
veteran favorably too. He knows
that Robbins has been a fine athlete
to use as a cornerstone for the
growth of the varsity game.

“By far he's the best defensive
player,“ said Reilly. “He’s the team
spark plug, a very intelligent player
offensively who has reﬁned the good
skills that he brought with him two
years ago."

After having a successful first year
with the Panthers, Robbins ran into
some difficulties his second time
around. Shortly after‘-the I980 sea-
son began, Pitt coaches Reilly and
Mike Hebert decided to switch their
offense from a 6-2 to a 5-I which
meant dropping one setter from the
starting squad.

“It put me out of the lineup for a

‘I.

continued from page seventeen——-——

time. But that made me even more
prepared to play wherever and whe-
never I was needed and give I l0% all
the time,"

The transition from one offense to
the other found Robbins sitting on
the bench for a short time period.
The move presented rough times but
Robbins overcame the adversity.

“I had no bitterness towards the
move. I just wanted to play some-
where,” said Robbins on the change.

Robbins has continued to fill that
position and is pleased with the spot
and the Panther squad for I981.

“This year’s team is deﬁnitely the
best one that Pitt has had," said
Robbins. “I think that things look
good for the Easternsiand I feel con-
fident that we will be in the top three
in the East. I eventhink that we have
the potential to upset either No. 1
Penn State or No. 2 Rutgers and be
rated even higher.”

Nixon warned that efforts to oppose
the cuts will be hampered by what
she termed a “divide and conquer”
strategy that forces the groups being
cut to fight against one another for
funding.

“We're in the last hour before
dawn,” commented Isaac Saxon
from Youth Movement for Jobs.
“Its time to stop licking our

  
  
 
 

    
 

-wounds. We must condition our-
selves for a fight.”

Saxon said there will be a demon-
stration against the cuts in Washing-
ton April I4. i

Pitt’s representative, Chip Roth
from the Governmental Relations
Committee, called on Pitt students

and the Pittsburgh community to
work together to fight the cuts.

The increasing cost of higher edu-

burghers, Roth said.

“We’re not really serving the Pitts-
burgh community if we can’t edu-
cate its working class,” he said.

Roth said the Governmental

dents to register to vote and tojoin a

“acquiring” a few eggs after break-
fast and slipping them into her coat
pocket, Shirk went to biology class
and forgot all about them. Until she
sat down. '

“I sat through the whole ‘hour-
and-20 minute class with eggs seep-
ing through my pockets,” Shirk said
laughing. “I didn't want anybody to
notice if I got up and walked out
with egg running down my leg, so I
just waited until class was over."

Shirk has done a few other things
but some of her tamer acts include
taking bites out offood in the cafete-
ria line, and putting them back on
the shelf—her friend calls her “the
John Belushi of the cafeteria”-—and
starting food fights.

“We got a standing ovation for
one of our fights,” Bell said.

“I've had to cut down on some of
the stuf ," Shirk deadpanned.
“We’ve been yelled at a few times.”

But Shirk hasn’t cut down on her
antics in the gym, as she continues
her gymnastics career at her accus-
tomed level of excellence. Shirk
started the season ranked as the
nation’s No.‘l gymnast, but after
suffering a shoulder injury, she
dropped, to No. 9.

“If she has a good performance,
Lisa Shirk is a contender for the‘
national title,” says Pitt coach
Donna Sanft.

After considering national gym-
nastics powerhouses like Utah and
UCLA, Shirk decided on Pitt

because she wanted to return to the
East coast and be closer to her fam-
ily. She also sought to attend a
school that did not have the large
scale programs like UCLA.

“I didn‘t want to go to the bigger
gymnastics schools because there is
so much pressure on you to pro-
duce," Shirk said. “It’s like you pro-
duce and worry about your carcass
later. I wanted to go to a school and
have a life outside of gyrnnastics.”

Because of chronic leg problems,
one of Shirk’s biggest concerns is her
physical health. By nature, the sport
of gymnastics involves a great deal
of physical pounding on a gymnast’s
body, which Shirk says always con-
cerns her, but is just a part of the
sport.

“It’s just expected that when you
get up on the uneven bars, you know
you‘re going to rip up you hands,”
Shirk says, “I’m always going to get
stress fractures in my legs. lt’s no big
deal. You’re always hurting.”

Because of her leg condition,
Shirk usually rides around malls in a
wheelchair when she goes shopping.

Then why does she continue doing
it, considering all the physical
pounding.

“I don't know,” Shirk said laugh-
ing, “I can’t imagine not doinggit.”

Sanft says, “To just say Lisa is a
wild person isn't a true picture of
her. She’s a very serious gymnast
and she’s very serious about what
she's doing in the gym.”

Eddie Murray. Al Bumbry, an out-
fielder, and infielder Rich Dauer
provide the speed. The genius is
supplied by Earl Weaver.

The Milwaukee Brewers will be
the team that finishes right behind
the Orioles. The Brewers have been
revamped. Returning stars are first
baseman Cecil Cooper, ourfielder
Ben Oglivie, infielder Paul Molitor
and shortstop Robin Yount. The
new additions are all-star catcher
Ted Simmons, relief pitcher Rollie
Fingers and starting pitcher Pete
Vuckovich. The Brewers have plenty
of power and solid defense. If their
pitching holds up and it’s pretty
good overall, they will be tough to
handle. Their best returning pitcher
is Moose Haas, with the sixth-best
ERA inthe American League.

Last season’s division winners, the
New York Yankees, should slip to
third. The Yankees’ position players
are some of the best in baseball. Led

by the famous Mr. October, Ameri-
can League home run king Reggie
Jackson, the Yankees also feature
the likes of outfielders Dave Win-
field, Jerry Mumphrey and lou
Piniella.

The infield is . first-rate with
second baseman Willie Randolph,
shortstop Bucky Dent, Graig Netles
at third and first baseman Bob Wat-
son. The catching is in the very capa-
ble hands of Rich,Cerone.

Like Milwaukee, pitching is their
Achilles heel. Tommy John isn’t get-

_ting any younger. Rudy May was

15-5 last year, but is 36. lfa couple of
starting pitchers are found, the Yan-
kees will contend. If not, Gene
Michael, the manager, can expect to
see the pink slip.

The Boston Red Sox will hold
onto fourth again this season. In
1980, they had their worst season in
years, finishing I9 games off the
pace. .

Finally we believe that a rotation

of faculty members into and out of
administrative posts would be bene-
_‘ ficial and would prevent the polari-
zation of faculty and administratio
that is taking place. « , ‘

These comments are not meant to
be exhaustive but rathersuggestive
of the type of reforms that are-neces-
sary. We ask that the chancellor .
create as early as possible a broad A
committee to recommend changes in
the administrative structure that are
necessary to restore creativity and
collegiality to fully realize the great
potential of our university. I

We call upon the president of the
University Senate to also form _a
committee to re-examine the role of
the senate in implementing collegial
governance. The senate must be the
faculty conscience in seeing that the
principle of collegiality is upheld in
the university’s decision making
