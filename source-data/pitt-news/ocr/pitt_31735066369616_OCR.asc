An informal human development
task force, composed of members
of various departments of Pitt’s
Student Affairs division, hopes to
design a program for human
development among new students
based on individual students needs
according to Jack Brown, assistant
director of student activities.

It is Vietnam Veterans Week and
as part of the national celebration,
Pitt will host a Veterans Education
and Training Day.

Sen. John D. Heinz R-Pa., one of
the sponsors of the senate bill
establishing the week, said in a
letter addressed to business
leaders that communities across
the country will “observe Vietnam
Veterans Week and recognize the
patriotism of those who served in
Southeast Asia.”

According to Jeff Parker and
Linda Ranson, veteransgcounselors
from the Office of Veterans Affairs,
some 12,000 veterans have been
invited to the special event which
will be held on Saturday, June 2
from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in the
Student Union Ball Room.

Representatives from Pennsyl-

vania colleges, universities, voca- -

tional schools and a host of other
institutions and government
agencies will talk about home
loans, civil service on the job
training programs, vocational re-
habilitation and other areas of
veterans’ interest.

“It’s a kind of different approach
to developing something postive

force will contribute their ideas
concerning human development to
the group, focusing particularly on
programs offered in each mem-
ber’s department.

After collecting this information,

-the group will develop a “common

philosophical statement” of what
human development encompasses,
he said.

’ “We will then identify student
needs to meet ‘those objectives,”

(as opposed to memorial ser-
vices),” Parker said.

About 800 local, veterans are
expected to attend the event, he
added.

Parker said people should know
the event is a source of information
for veterans, not a job fair.

“Because of the lack of
information, we feel that an
information training center is

someplace to find out what to do.” “

Vietnam veterans have been the
victims of bad publicity, stereo-
typed by television and movies as
“psychotic" or the bad guy.

“The way Vietnam Veterans are
portrayed is not realistic at all," he
said.

The Office of Veterans Affairs

P processes about 1,100 inquiries per

term dealing mostly with veterans’
benefits, said Al Bowen, director of
the Office of Special Student
Services. Veterans Affairs reports
to Bowens’ office. 2

“We have a service 1 that’s
around the clock, not just one week
out of the year,” he said.

The office employs six to 11
veterans throughout the year who
are responsible for doing paper
work in dealing with benefits,
Bowen said.

he said. “Hopefully, we can
design an approach for meeting
those needs.”

Brown said needs are an
important consideration in building
the human development program.

In a survey of Pitt. students
conducted by the counseling center
in the Spring of 1977, public
speaking anxiety was identiﬁed by
32.2 percent of those polled as their
chief problem.

Other problem areas are: fear of

purpose, 22.0 percent; relations
with faculty, 19.4 _ percent;
depression, 19.0 percent; com-
munication problems 18.0 percent,
and loneliness, 17.6 percent.

Approximately 10 percent of the
Pitt population received the survey
with about 800 responding.

grams around groups of freshmen

or transfer students.
“My vision is to pilot this

program with freshmen, new_

students who haven’t gotten
caught up with the shoulds or

According to Brown, many
universities have a similar develop-
ment program. Among those cited
as examples are Colorado State,
Rhodelsland, and Santa Barbara.

Search for Towers Murdersuspect Reaches No End 1

By GLENN FREUND

Over four months of investiga-
tion by city and campus police have
failed to produce a suspect in the
January murder of freshman
Monica Renee Jones.

Jones, 18, Philadelphia, was
raped and strangled in the Tower A
basement laundry room on January
4.

Campus police Chief Curt
Graham expressed hope that the
search will lead to apprehension of
a suspect.

“We pick up leads as they come
in and continue to follow up on
them,” said Graham. “Things
have been coming up constantly.”

Graham said he could not
speculate on the probability of
identifying the man and said,
“with the passage of time it
becomes more difficult” for people
to remember people and events.

Graham said the investigation is
being led by city police detectives
since “homicide "s a first-time
thing for us.”

“The level of investigation
between the two departments is
fantastic. We’ll continue to

contribute what we can until we

locate the killer,” Graham said.

Detective Fran Walsh who is
leading the investigation by the
Campus police calls it “a process of
‘elimination to see if leads correlate
with what we know.”

Walsh said there is a false
impression that a composite
released by the Campus police
office is the prime suspect.

“He is just the only person we
have not contacted who was seen in
the area,” Walsh said.

The composite was taken from a
witness’ who, under hypnosis,
provided a description of a man in
the area at the time of the murder.

“We’re going to actively pursue
the investigation and follow every
lead that comes along,” said
Graham.

Any information pertaining to
the murder of Monica Renee Jones
should be directed to Campus
police detective Fran Walsh.

SHOWCASE on

Entertainment

By MARK MONAHAN

Every Saturday night at 10:25, the
Decade Lounge in Oakland is packed to
the rafters as people buzz with hungry
anticipation.

In the front half of the lounge, regulars
stand three deep at the huge rectangular
bar harassing the busy bartenders for
drinks. Caracitures of local street people
aha employees line all -four walls while
T-shirts, Steeler and Panther football
souvenirs hang from the ceiling.‘

Waitresses hustle back and forth
between tables in the back section of the
bar trying to dodge the large crowd of
hardcore rockers camped in front of the
Decade stage. Old Rolling Stone's songs
from the mid-1960’s pour through the
bar’s smokey atmosphere as spirits ﬂow
and loud conversation fills the air.

At exactly 10:30, the jukebox is turned
off and six young men from Pittsburgh
take the stage. Dressed in torn jeans,
leather jackets, T-shirts, tennis shoes and
sunglasses, they hardly look like
candidates for a young executive training
program.

They do look like rock’n’roll musicians,
however, which is exactly what they are.
They’re the Iron City Houserockers.

The Houserockers, Joe Grushecky:
vocals and guitar; Art Nardini: bass; Gary

Scalese: guitar; Gil Snyder: keyboards; ~

Marc Reisman: harmonica; and Ned E.
Rankin: drums, have been together as a
band for less than two years but have
already racked up the most impressive
list of credentials of any area band and
serve as Pittsburgh's best hope for
getting on the -rock’n’roll map. I

The Houserockers were voted the best
rock’n’roll band in Pittsburgh by
Pittsburgh Music Magazine in its recent
music poll. More importantly, they have
a recording and distribution deal with a
national label--MCA Records. Their first
album, “Love’s 50 Tough," was recorded
in Cleveland at various times over the last
two years.

All these speedy developments may
sound like the typical rags to riches story.
However, all of these wonderful. things
did not happen overnight or by sheer
luck.

Grushecky once taught children in a
hospital mental ward. ’ Snyder and
Scalese went to college pursuing
cinematography and art degrees.
Reisman graduated from Pitt and played
in an all black band while Nardini and

Houserockers lead singer Joe Grushecky

Rankin labored in lounge bands around’
the Pittsburgh area.

To be sure, the Houserockers have paid
their collective dues and have worked for
everything they’ve got with a drive and
determination foreign to most bands in
the Pittsburgh area. '

When the group was started out in
early 1977 under the name Brick Alley
(the name of a red-light district in
Pittsburgh), club owners did not always
take kindly to the band because they

didn’t play the traditional watered-down if

cover versions of the day.

Instead, the band played original
material and covers which were loud.
emotional and raw and based on the
no-frill stype of rock’n’roll masters like
Chuck Berry, Little Richard, John Lee
Hooker, with a dash of Rolling Stones. ‘J.
Geils and New Wave thrown in for good
measure.

According to the tall and charismatic

Gruschecky. the band’s refusal to
conform to playing top forty often got
them in trouble. 7

“We were ﬁred from just about every
place we played at least once, sometimes

twice,” recalls Gruschecky. “In fact. in I

one of the dumps we used to play, our
soundman had a gun pulled on him
because he refused to turn down our
mix."

And to this day, if you wander into one
of the Houserockers’ club dates expecting
to hear something jazzy or mellow-—for-
get it. You’ll be in the wrong place.

The hard times for the band ceased

when they changed their name in October _

of 1977. Switching from Brick Alley to the
Iron City Houserockers solidiﬁed their
identification with Pittsburgh where all
the band members were born. raised and
learned their rock’n’roll.

Around this time, Grushecky started -to
come up with the ﬁnal, rock solid original

3

material appearing on “Love's So
Tough.” Eight of nine songs on the
album are Houserocker originals.

The band sent demos of three songs,

“Heroes are Hard to Find,” “House-

rocker” and Chuck Berry’s “Bye-Bye
Johnny” to various record companies but
received rejections from everyone except
one man, Steve Popovich, an A&R
m,an/ vice president at Columbia records.

At the time, Popovich had. just pulled
off the contract of the decade when he

. signed the soon to be multi-platinum

Boston to Epic, a branch of Columbia.
When the Houserockers were Signed.

Popovich was looking for new acts to

stock his new label and management

-company, Cleveland International. Since

then, Popovich has succeeded in breaking
the multi-platinum Meatloaf and signing
English rock legend Ian Hunter. Later,
the band would be signed for MCA by
vice president/A&R man Denny Rosen-
crantz.

With the record contract under their
belts, the Houserockers began honing
their original material and working on
their stage act at various locales around
the Pittsburgh area. The Decade served
as their official home.

Although the record is of superb mix
and quality with_many of the cuts (“Tum
it Up,” “Hideaway," “Dance with Me"
and “Heroes are Hard to Find") perfect
for widespread FM play, and two or three
(“Love So Tough,” “Veronica” and “I'm
Lucky (1 Can Still Rock’n’Roll) possible
AM hits, the band must be seen live to be
fully appreciated. ‘

On stage, the band has a habit of
turning their sets into rousing and
energetic rock’n’roll celebrations.
Usually by the end of their three nightly
sets, especially at the Decade, people will
be out of their seats rockin’ toward the
front of the stage in time to the infectious
beat and drive of the Houserockers loud
and tight blues based rock’n’roll.

The most prominent visual portion of
the band’s performance are provided by
Grushecky's raw voice. conﬁdent stage
presence and hot guitar style. Reisman’s
powerful harmonica blasts and Snyder’s
crazed antics with his toppling keyboards
also add to the show. ' .

However, no one goes to the hot dog
stand in the Houserockers. It's a group
sound and image. All six members add a
special talent and ﬂare to the cocky stage

Backspace Features Student Prose . and   Poetry

By MARK HOLAN

After numerous funding problems.
Backspace, Pitt's literary magazine. was
finally released last week to the
University community and local book-
stores. The.magazine contains 68 pages

contributed by undergraduates._ This is
the first year that the publication contains
no faculty contributions.

The first half of the Backspace is prose.
including five short stories and two novel
excerpts.

_ “Kickin’ The Gong Around." a short
story by Gary Bradford, opens the prose
section. It is a nicely crafted tale about J.
C. Harris, an “arthritic. stoop-shouldered
old cat that plays the trumpet.” Bradford
does a fine job in capturing -the essence of

compromised by many years of drinking
and playing. _

A novel excerpt by Cathy D. Miller
follows. Her story about Meg and the sea

tangible objects and real
experiences. It is well written. but reads
more like a poem than a novel. -

“Passing Through Toledo." “Single-
Lens Reflex" “Shattered Mirrors."
another novel excerpt. and “A Tale from
the Zikr of Al Khizr" complete the prose
section. Marc Selvaggio's “Toledo" and

University Theater
Opens Tonight

With ‘Fantasticx’ -

By MICHAEL McCABE

Tonight in the Stephen Foster
Memorial, the University Theatre pres-
ents a public preview of its spring

production, ‘ ‘The Fantasticks. ’ '

First presented off-broadway in 1960
and still playing, “The Fantasticks” is
America's longest‘ running hit show. “Try
to Remember” is the best known of the
popular songs from the show. Creators
Tom Jones and Harvey Schmidt took: the
idea for the musical from an 1894 play,
“Les Romanesques,” written by French
- dramatist Edmund Rostand, author of
“Cyrano de Bergerac.” The story follows
the old romantic pattern of boy meets
girl, boy loses girl, boy wins girl. Still, it’s
not quite that simple.
“Instead of mounting another overly
sweet version of the show, we’ll stage the

play so that the audience will appreciate
both the naive and romanticside of life
and love, as well as the darker, cynical
undertones. Balancing out these
opposing forces of light and dark, sun and
rain we hope to bring the audience to a

clear and tealistic perspective. The show ‘

has a lot more to it than the ordinary
musical; that's why it’s been running so
long,” says director James Gardner.

Gardner is a twenty-ﬁve year old
graduate student and teaching assistant
in the Theatre Arts Department. This
production marks the first time a
graduate student has directed on Pitt’s
Mainstage.

The regular opening is tomorrow night.
Evening performances are scheduled for
8 p.m. June 1-2, 7-9 and 14-16. Matinees
are June 3 and 10 at 2 p.m.

Pitt’s Literary Magazine,

(Continued from page 2)

Scott Howard Mann contributes thre:
excellent poems. Especially good is
“Field Trip” and “The Elephant Shit
Check."

Steve Denning, a grad student with a
master's in poetry, contributes ﬁve
poems. Two of these, “The Movie” and
“Kim-San”, recall the days of Vietnam.
“I’ll Be Your Mirror,” a lengthy two
and a half page poem by Robert Wagner,
is perhaps the best poem in Backspace. ‘It

combines gut-level emotion with vivid
and stirring imagery.

There are also seven original photo-
graphs in Backspace. The cover is a pen
and ink drawing by Gary Weinberg. The
photos are good but none are stand-outs.
Several are placed opposite poems or
prose which have different subject matter
and themes. This, unfortunately,
distracts from both.

might come across in a two and a half
hour stage production in which the actors
are silent and almost all stage movement
is reduced to slow motion.

The play in question is “India Song,”
Pittsburgh Lab Theater’s ﬁnal production
of its seventh season. Director Bill
Royston’s adaptation of Margerite Duras’
1975 screenplay (highly. praised at the
Cannes Film Festival but never released

' in the United States) is a provocative

piece, however, one which makes the
audience struggle a little more than
usual; even at the Lab Theater.

“India Song” is set within the conﬁnes
of the French Embassy at India in /1937,

, the year the Western Depression hit that

country. It is a desperate love story which
revolves around three primary charac-
ters: Anne—Marie Stretter (Bobbie Van
Eman), Michael Richardson (Jim Ed-
mondson) and the French Vice-Consul
(Dean Hyland).

Stretter is the Ambassador's wife. a
mysteriously beautiful woman who hosts
at least ﬁve lovers at the Embassy.
Richardson is her main lover, a man who
seems tounderstand that no one can
claim Stretter as their own but who
remains jealous of others nevertheless.

The Vice-Consul, who has recently
arrived in Calcutta from Lahore in
disgrace (a detail never fully explained in
the play) is a brooding psychotic. He is
also an emotional and physical virgin who
lusts menalingly after Stretter.

“India Song" is presented with a total
absence of spoken lines by the on-stage
actors-. Instead, off-stage tape recorded
voices narrate the story.

 Lab Theater Challanges Audience with ‘India Song’

In the first act, two women hold a
dialogue which concentrates mainly on
Stretter’s background and her relation-
ship with Richardson. The third act,
narrated by two men, concerns the
murder of Stretter and the sudden
disappearance of the Vice-Consul.

The second act, a reception for a
visiting Spanish Ambassador at the
Embassy, is overdubed with the voices of
the many guests. The effect is almost,
but not quite, lip synche.

Added to this technique is a bare
minimum of stage movement, an original
score by David Miller which is good for
the first act but which is repeated
throughout the remainder of the play to
-the point of being monotonous and a
gauzy screen which separates actors fo
au-dience. , *~

Royston’s effort is noble in its
experimental pursuit. The total effect,
however, only adds an extra chill to an
already cold story line. After only several
minutes, the audience begins to loose
interest and meaning.‘ The Lab Theater,
in turn, begins to lose patrons.

Despite the unusual format, Van
Eman, Edmondson and Hyland fair well
in the production. In the second act,
Hyland’s crazed last tango with the

Spanish Ambassador’s wife is especially (

good and provides the evenings only
moment of catharsis.

Although not the Lab’s best production
this season, “India Song” is a must for
alternative theater afﬁcianados. The play
runs Thursdays through Sundays until
June.:16.

Houserockers signed; but they realize
regular FM airplay or an AM hit coupled
with well-received touring is what will
make them stars.

“You can never stop writing new
material or coming up with fresh ideas on
how to improve your live act,” said
Grushecky. “Once you do that, you're
through.”

“In this day and age it's also hard for a
band to go anywhere without airplay.
Trying to slug it out on tour, exposing
people to your music gradually seem to be
a thing of the past. The record companies
want the records to sell and then follow
that up with touring. However. even if
the first one doesn't break us, we still
have songs either recorded or unrecorded
to follow up what success we do have,"
said Grushecky.

If the Iron City House_Rockers could
break nationally, it would give the
Pittsburgh music scene a much needed
shot in the arm.

Several other local acts, such as
country rockers Gravel and the now

‘ defunct quasi punk band, Diamond Reo.

had national recording contracts but were
subsequently dropped when their records
failed to sell because of lack of record
company support.

Of late, the only other local act to be
doing anything of note is the Granatti
Brothers from Beaver Falls. They're
signed to A&M records and currently out
on tour with Van Halen. The band will

appear June 16 at the Civic Arena with
Peter Frampton.

V As it stands now, MCA seems to be
throwing its full support behind the
Houserockers. The group will be
performing around the area up until into
early June, then will leave on a tour to
support other Cleveland International
Acts such as the Ian Hunter/ Mick Ronson
Band.

Although the results aren’t in yet on
the success of the album or the tour, the
talent, potential and total commitment to
rock’n’roll music is present. This
commitment has always been at the heart
of the Houserockers.

“We’ve always had this total commit— ‘
merit and believed in ourselves and our
music even when no one else did,” said
Nardini. “Many area bands make the
mistake of getting lazy playing cover
versions or top forty and in the process
lose their ambition to create anything
original of their own. I feel we've always
been different since we always wanted to
record and tour with our own material."

Even though it will be a sad day when
the Iron City Houserockers leave the
Pittsburgh club scene for good to rock the
rest of the nation, continued success will
serve as a nice present to their large
following of fans and friends in
Pittsburgh‘ who have come to know and
believe in them as true torchbearers of
the power and glory of rock'n'roll music.

with today’s trends.

Stewart, his band and stage set, were
decked out in what can be described most
accurately as glitter disco: the backdrops
ran anywhere from intense red and black
graphics to billowing, red satin stage
curtains.

Stewart himself looked as though he
was planning a trip to a high-class disco.
going through several costume changes
that included satin pants, silk blue-and-
white polka dot shirts, silvery eye—shadow
black eyebrow pencil and several layers of
white pancake stage make-up.

Though Stewart ﬂaunted this disco,

. ‘sexy’ image as he pranced and strutted

around the stage, his vocals were straight
from the “Rod The Mod" era, the early
’70s when Stewart ﬁrst grabbed the U.S.
by its ear with his rakish, irregular voice.

His vocals were best on “Maggie
May,” when his band toned down its
continuous, nearly incomprehensible
sound, and let only soft, gentle and
extremely fine acoustic guitar work back
Stewart. Here Stewart came ‘through
clearly, his voice recognizable and close
to the sound he projects on recordings.

The same was true with “Standing In
The Shadow Of Love,” “If Loving You Is
Wrong-(J Don’t Wanna Be Right),” and
“You’re In My Heart.”

‘.‘Sweet Little Rock And Roller,”
“Twistin’ The Night Away,” and similiar
rockers didn’t disappoint the crowd, but it
was difficult to distinquish one guitar

lick from another, or single-out Stewart’s A

voice, as - the band grinded through
fast-paced pieces.

Fuzzy work from the back-up band was
the biggest disappointment of the
evening; in all fairness, however, most of
this was due to the traditionally poor
acoustics of the Civic Arena.

A good deal of the continuous buzzing
of the band could have been eliminated,
though, by allowing a reasonable amount
of time to lapse between numbers. The
band rarely took breaks, the only
significant one being a stop two hours
into the three hour concert when the
curtains_closed to allow the band to line
up for a bow. It reopened to reveal
musicians clustered around Stewart, and
waving bottles of beer.

The crowd was younger than what
would be expected, considering Stewart’s
popularity was established among fans
who were hanging out behind the local
high school drinking Iron City beer
early-on in this decade when Stewart first
began getting top-40s radio airplay. A

The 15 through 17 year-olds that held
the majority of the arena’s 14,000 seats
seemed to appreciate Stewart, though,
particularly when he performed cuts from
his latest release. “Blondes Have More
Fun."

“Do Ya Think I'm Sexy?" drew the
crowd to its feet both times Stewart ran
through the number, despite the boos and
hissing he received when making an
innuendo to disco as he introduced the
number the first time.

With hips swaying, hands clapping and
voice chanting choruses, fans helped
Stewart through all his most popular hits.
and from comments made after the show
they didn’t seem to mind the Indian-
apolis-500 pace kept during the evening.

Monday night at the Civic Arena.

So Stewart pleased. However, the
satisfaction would have been greater and
the ticket price——$10.75——compensated
for if Stewart’s band had slowed down a
bit to allow time for his usually excellent

.lyrics, music and vocals to‘be absorbed by
the crowd instead of generally bouncing
off the interior of the Arena.

As it was, Stewart proved he’s
still—vocally at least—-the ‘Rod The Mod’
who thrilled and continues to thrill
rock-and-roll fans. but who's learned that
popularity in 1979 means being able to
sweep quickly in and out of cities to make
a fast buck, never minding that such
tactics leave something to be desired.

Supertramp’s ‘Breakfast In America’ Served-Up Soon

By GARY GRAFF

Supertramp is not the kind of band one
would expect to be performing in massive
hockey arenas, where the cavernous
obstructions play havoc with the sound.
The quintet's intricate style seems more
suited for smaller halls or for intimate
cafes, like the one which rests in the rear
corner of Supertramp's stage.

Supertramp will perform in a large
arena, however, when the “Breakfast In
America" show is served to Pittsburgh
Monday evening at the Civic Arena.

The 40-plus date 1979 tour is a peak in
Supertramp’s eight year career, and the
arenas and crowds of 15-20,000 are
welcome sights to the band. They signify
Supertramp’s entrance into the superstar
status, helped in no small part by the rise
of “Breakfast” on every chart and the
success of the singles, “The Logical
Song” and “Goodbye Stranger.”

The concerts reflect the warm, breezy
style of Supertramp’s music. From the
time the curtain draws back, revealing
Rick Davies doing the harmonica
introduction to “School,’ there’s a bond
of familiarity between audience and

band. _
This bond exists mainly because the

majority of the patrons on the early part
of the tour, before “Breakfast” was

released, came to hear favorites from ’

“Crime of the Century,” “Crisis, What
Crisis?” and “Even In The Quietest
Moments,” the albums that . slowly
garnered .a loyal following for Super-
tramp.

Supertramp doesn’t disappoint the old

fans because of its success, either.
At two sold out St. Louis shows in March,
the band played a balanced list of
material from all four albums, including
the entire “Crime of the Century” lp.
In addition to the obligatory per-
formances of the recent hits are
outstanding versions of “Fool’s Over-I
ture," “Sister Moonshine," “Another
Man's Woman," and “Rudy.”

The key to a Supertramp show is
reedman John A. Helliwell. While the
rest of the band concentrates on the
music, Helliwell guides the show with
witty comments beween songs, and a
variety of costumes and antics. Bass
player Dougie Thomson assists Helliwell.
prancing about the stage with him and
twisting his face at the audience.

In contrast are bandleaders Davies and
Roger Hodson, who dominate the music
with Supertramp's trademark piano
attack. They play out the roles of their
songs perfectly; Davies the lecherous
romantic and Hodson the philosophic
balladeer, performing some impressive
electric guitar runs and a strong acoustic
version of “Even In The Quietest
Moments.”

The entire concert is punctuated by
tasteful visuals. Thelighting is dynamic,
setting moods for each of the songs, while
ﬁlms are used during long instrumental
passages on “Rudy,” “Fool’s Overture,”
and “Crime of the Century. ” None of the
visual tactics take away from the music,
however, amking for a well-balanced

“Love’e So Tough”
Iron City Houserockers
MCA Records

“Love’s So Tough,” the first album
from Pittsburgh’s own Iron City
Houserockers, is the best rock’n’roll
album to come out of the area in years.

Even though the cynical may laugh and
say “nothing musical ever comes out of
Pittsburgh,” the Houserockers, with this
album, is the band which is ﬁnally going
to spearhead the emergence of the vast
amount of musical talent in this city.

, “Love’s So Tough” consists of _nine
impressive songs of no-frills rockers and
gritty blues ballads showcasing ” the
Houserockers pumping and exciting hard
edged roc ’n’roll sound. with 3 solid
foundation in urban blues and techniques
picked up from the masters of rock’n’roll.
And as always, the Houserockers, Joe
Grushecky—guitar and vocals; Art
Nardini: bass; Gary Scalese; guitar; Gil
Snyder: keyboards; Marc Reisman:
harmonica; and Ned E. Rankin: drums,
deliver the material with total conviction.

' stinging guitars

The musical sound and mix of “Love's
So Tough” is slicker than the House-
rockers live but does not undercut the
power of the music. Instead, it is made
smoother for radio airplay.

» Kansas
Monolith
Kirchner/Columbia

, Success is a shaky ground for Kansas.
It took four albums for the band’s
aggressive, complex songs to catch on
with radio programmers across the
country, and in turn with a large amount
of the record buying public.

Even after two mammoth selling
albums and hit singles from each, Kansas
is in no way insured of instant success
with “Monolith,” its latest effort. That
much was shown with last November's
live release, “Two For The Show,” which
ﬂoundered in both quality and sales.

What’s more, there’s no assurance that
those turned onto Kansas with “Leftover-V
ture” and “Point of Know Return” will
continue to accept the complex arrange-
ments and intense lyrics that mark the
sextet’s style.

One thing is certain for “Monolith;” it
will please the Kansas fans who caught
on from the beginning, many of whom
expressed disappointment with “Point of
Know Return.” “Monolith” is a return
to the, less structured, punchier style of
“Masque” and “Song For America.”

This doesn’t mean that there aren’t any
possibilities for hit singles on “Mono-
lith.” “People of the South Wind” is a

smooth, bouncy song with Steve Walsh’s "
A “ice skating” organ ﬁlling between the

choruses, and some good vocal exchanges

between Walsh and violinist Robbie

Steinhardt.

The album’s last song, “Reason to
Be,” also has promise as a single. It falls
between the hard rocking “Carry On
Wayward Son” and the haunting “Dust
In The Wind,” sounding a bit like
America. Dave Williams contributes
some ﬁne acoustic guitar lines under
Walsh and Steinhardt’s ﬂawless harmon-
ies, and Kerry Livgren lays a warm
synthesizer line over all of it.

That’s the softest “Monolith” gets,
though. The other six numbers all have a
heavy, guitar dominated kick to them.
Livgren, who writes most uf the material
on “Monolith,” has decided to pick up

The real surprise of the album is the
quality of the lyrics penned . by
Grushecky. g

In a bar, his gruff and highly emotional
voice and delivery sometimes over-
shadows the lyrics he’s singing. Not so
on “Love’s So Tough.”

Since Grushecky, like the rest of the
Houserockers grew up in our beloved city
of Steel, Iron City Beer and the Steelers,
“Love’s So Tough” songs have scenarios
which concisely capture a glimpse of what
it’s like to grow up in the urban setting of
a big city with all of its joys, disappoint-
ments, triumphs and broken hearts.

And to this extent, this _is an album
which actually means something more
than “shake your groove thing, I need
some hot stuff to’ help me get down
tonight’! or all the other non-content and
crap songs being aired by radio today.

Side One opens with a powerful and
rebellious rocker, ‘‘I Can’t Take It,”
which features a troubled “Jimmy”
driving his “Mother to an early grave”
with his wild running around and tough
guy behavior. The song features the
of Scalese and
Grushecky. ‘

“Hideaway” is a‘ song of forbidden
love between two already married people
sneaking around trying to avoid the anger
of their respective husband and wife. The

his guitar again, and use the synthesizers
and electric grand pianos sparingly.
Particularly good is “A Glimpse of

Home,” an up-beat, rocking ballad that '

alternates between three meters, Walsh’s
piano keeping pace with the guitars.

The mood changes are even more’
pronounced on the magniﬁcent “Angels
Have Fallen.” Steinhardt opens the
song, softly singing over the piano. The
song builds into a middle section that
features Livegren and Williams’ growling
guitars, then winds down for two verses,
only to build up again with Steinhardt’s
violin leading the outro.

The opening number, “On The Other
Side,” is more similar to past Kansas
songs. Livgren solos over a synthesized
backing, and the song rises and falls
between chorus and verse, the scorching
guitar lines providing a ﬂow. Walsh’s
vocals are ﬁlled with emotion and

carefully lead into an intriguing instru— ,

mental passage.

“Away From You” sounds much like
Jethro Tull’s “Thick As A Brick” with its
rolling organ line and seating violin. The
acoustic guitar line is solid’ and Walsh’s
vocals are once again stunning.

While the overall feel of “Monolith” is
hard, two songs stand out as very, very
hard rockers.
could really be any hard-rock band, but
Kansas handles it with confident
authority. It easily surpasses “Point of
Know Return’s” token rocker, “Light-
ning’s Hand.”

“How My Soul Cries Out For You” is
the album’s coupe—a trip through all
sorts of hard rock styles in a slaphappy,
almost disorganized ‘manner. Steinhardt
leads his violin over the ever present
guitars while the band chants the title.
Then the song proper begins, with Walsh
and Steinhardt engaging in ﬁry vocal
exchanges over pounding piano lines.

Suddenly, it all stops as a door opens
and we are walked into a room full of
peopleand elevator music. A scream, a
crash, and Phil Ehart’s drums drive the

(written by Fred Goodman), it features
strong vocals from Grushecky and

’ Rankin’s hypnotic snare rolls.

“Turn it Up" is a gritty blues ballad
about one of life’s losers and his problems
with drugs and alcohol and ﬁnding solace
in the music. Billy Cross, a guitarist who
once toured with Bob Dylan's. Rolling
Thunder Revue, throws in some nasty
slidework.

“Dance With Me,” “Veronica,” “Stay
With Me” and the title track of the
album, “Love’s So Tough,” deal with
most men's number one problem,
attracting girls and then holding on to
them. ’

“Dance With Me” and “Stay with
Me” are two soft ballads while “Love So
Tough” and “Veronica” rock-out and
prove these guys have had a few girls
walk away from them.

The two strongest songs on the album
are on Side Two. “Heroes are Hard to
Find” asks one question: “Where are the
heroes of rock’n’roll?”....“They dressed
up in glitter then they dressed up in

drag...changed to metal music, changed .
to disco machine, going down to my local X

drug store and trade in all my dreams.”
“I’m Lucky” is the band’s tour de force
live and appropriately the last blast of
rock’n’roll on the album.

with a message that no matter how bleak
things get, you're lucky cause you can

Grushecky sings in tandem with guest
female vocalist, Tampa Lynn, the words
this band lives on, “I’m Lucky, I can still

This is the type of song that gets people
out of their seats, shouting their belief in
that divine form of music known as
rock’n’roll, and the altar on which the
Houserockers build their church.

In the stores for a little less than a
week, this album has already been
spotlighted by the bible of the record
industry, Billboard Magazine, as the
breakout album of the week and was the
top album added on to FM playlists
around the country.

Why? The songs are superbly crafted
and arranged and the album rocks with a
purpose and a message. It’s almost
unbelievable this is a debut album.

Patti Smith Group I
Wave
Arista

Patti Smith, the princess and poetess
of punk, New York style, has earned the
respect as an innovative, if not tour de
force rock artist throughout her critically
acclaimed career. Even though many

' times her ideas backﬁre and she falls ﬂat
on her face, Smith willingly sticks her
neck out in the name of rock’n’roll.

However, on the Patti Smith Group’s
lastest album, “Wave,” the adventism
has been shelved in favor of a proven

. success formula. Gone, for the most part,
are the avant-garde, street poems that
dominated earlier releases such as
“Horses” and “Radio Ethiopia.” In
their place lies thickly layered instru-
ments and arrangements due, in part, to
the production work of Todd Rundgren
and to the ‘band’s inspired musicmanship.

After three albums, Smith has found
her niche and with “Wave” she seems

comfortable, if not conﬁdent. And in this ,

case, that formula is not all bad.
“Wave” opens with the beautiful and
impassioned “Frederick,” in many ways
a followup to the chart-topping “Because
the Night” from -last year’s “Easter” LP.
Only this time out, instead of sharing
writing credit with Bruce Springsteen,
Smith stakes sole claim to “Frederick”
which proves her growth as a composer as
well as a singer. In fact, Smith’s vocals

throughout “Wave” are strong, full and-

downright pretty.

But it is “Frederick” that stands as the
album’s most outstanding cut, featuring
some tasty keyboards from Richard Sohl
and an infectious discoish rhythm.

“Dancing Barefoot,” the second cut,
has a nostalgic, 60’s rock’n’roll feel to it
due to the variety of classic guitar effects.
As does “So You Wanna Be (A
Rock’n’Roll Star),” the old Byrds tune
that the Patti Smith Group breathes new
life into with a crisp, churning backbeat
from drummer Jay Dee Daugherty. “So'
You Wanna Be” has a spontaneous live
sound, twice as exciting ‘as the original.
Rundgren, who must live in the studio
these days,- producing The Tubes, Meat
Loaf, The Tom Robinson Band, Utopia
and himself deserves special credit for
the lively feel of this rendition.

“Hymn” is nothing more than a cute,
“little song _to sing to sleep,” obviously
ﬁller material but nonetheless, an
attempt at diversity. Side One closes with
the savage “Revenge,” slightly remin-
iscent of the Beatle’s “I Want You.(She’s

_So Heavy),” but is far, more blatantly ‘

brutal.

Side Two starts off with the intense
“Citizen Ship” which is highlighted by
Lenny Kaye’s hard and searing guitar
work. Once again, Smith’s voice soars
like a woman possessed. Unfortunately,

_ Rundgren’s production buries the intelli-

gence of the words. _
“Seven Ways of Knowing” never
really gets off the ground but “Broken
‘Flag,” like “Citizen Ship” and “Freder-
ick,” demonstrates the real improvement
in Smith’s singing. This time, Smith
pulls off a magniﬁcent job with a tender

7’ ballad. -

Unfortunately, “Wave” ends on a sour
note with the rather inane title track.
Backed by the sound of wind rolling
waves, Smith carries on a silly dream-like
dialogue with the late Pope John Paul 1.
Given the importance of this piece as the
name of the album, “Wave” leaves the

Wet Willie
Which One’: Willie
Epic I

Wet Willie, A six member rock n’
boogie band out of Nashville, is perhaps
best known for its hit singles “Keep On
Smilin" and “Street Corner Serenade."
The band has appeared in Pittsburgh
twice; as a warm-up for Grand Funk and
sandwiched between an obscure Bob
Segar and his Silver Bullet Band and the
super-hyped Bachman-Tumer Overdrive
in a 1974 Arena show. Wet Willie played
an excellent set at their ’76 appearance,
coming back on stage for two encores
(rare for a warm-up act) and generally out
performing the bumbling Bachmarls.

“Which One's Willie?" is Wet Willie's
newest release. The most noticable tune
on the nine-cut disc is called “Week-

(Style On ‘Bad Girls’

By FORREST B 

Bad Girls
Donna Summer
Casablanca

Donna Summer’s new release, “Bad
Girls,” is an attempt to cross from disco
into the worlds of rock and roll and
rhythm and blues. And although the
Summer sound still features the disco
trademark of a steady bass and drum
beat, some changes and additions have
been made.

One of these is the guitarwork of Jeff
Baxter, former Steely Dan studio main-
stay and now' ex-Doobie Brother. In
addition to smooth, fluid and tight
guitarwork, he contributes a nicely fluent
solo to “Hot Stuff.”

Also, listen to the horns and
arrangements. In pieces like “Love Will
Always Find You” a distinct New‘0rleans
jazz ﬂavor is evident. This same jazz feel
also permeates “One Night in a
Lifetime.”

The synthesizers haxe been toned
down a bit from her last studio LP, “Once
Upon a Time,” although they still
dominate some pieces (“Our Love” and
“Lucky”).

This is Summer’s third successive (and p

successful) double album. However,
unlike the previous “Live and More” or
the masterpiece “Once Upon a Time”
there is no real continuity or story here.
In “Live,” as in nearly all live albums,
the continuity was the show itself, the
way the songs blended into each other.
And on “Once Upon A Time” the story
was classic with a twist: girl meets boy,
girl loses boy, girl finds boy again. All

songs on the album contributed to this
plot.

But. in this album the story is much
more vague. Basically, it centers on_the
trials and tribulations of being a hooker.

and falling in and out of love with one’s '

clients. There is also a very real need felt
for escape from this life.

The question is are the girls “bad” by
choice (“Bad Girls”), or are they just
confused by what they think is love
(“Lucky”) or do they feel pressured by
society (“Sunset People”)? Summer
explores all these possibilities, probing
each with her distinctive clear voice.

There is a love theme here, in that

many of the songs are love ballads.‘ '

Unlike“Once Upon a Time,” however,
these songs have no direction. They
don’t point to any real end. This dry;-.sn’t
affect the quality of them, as all are very
good, especially the ballads. But with
previous works the listener just knew, as
in a good movie, what the end would be.

After such a good concept album like ’

“Time,” almost a “disco-opera” with
continuing characters throughout the
album, a simple collection of love songs,
good as they might be, is a deﬁnite step
down. ’

The production is slick and the music. A

tight . and controlled. While many
consider this to be disco’s biggest fault,
Summer’s producers use this to her
advantage. Standout tunes include
ulluckyxv “Hot Stumn “Sunset People,”
“Love Will Always Find You,” “My
Baby Understands” and “One Night in a
Lifetime.”

“Bad Girls” is a good record. But
“Once Upon a Time” was better, and the
consumer must decide whether a
collection of songs is better. than a story.

‘You give me love

and I will give you Peace.’

  Track Team Ffth; Kinney Qualiﬁes A

 

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Staff Writer

With one Panther on his way to
NCAA’s and ﬁve other top place
ﬁnishers, the mens’ track team was
able to record a ﬁne showing at the
Central Collegiate Conference
meet last weekend. Pitt placed
ﬁfth out of 20 teams at the
Notre-Dame hosted affair.

Qualifying for the national meet
to be held this weekend, was
freshman "Larry Kinney, who
triple-jumped a career-best of
52-3% ‘ at Notre Dame. The
ﬁrst-year leaper has progressed
tremendously since his initial

competition for Pitt in January.

In order to qualify for nationals,
Kinney needed to clear at least 52
feet. Until last Saturday, he had
fallen short of the mark.

Two weeks ago, Kinney was
named Most Valuable Field Athlete
at the Pitt Invitational,_ and
although he had won competitions
at Penn State, Penn Relays and
numerous indoor meets, his best
was still 51’6”.

Last Saturday, Kinney was ‘able
to add 8 inches to his best mark and
surpass his own Pitt Record for the

second time thisseason.

Pitt had another ﬁeld event
winner in Steve Roebuck. The
Panther javelin ._thrower threw

The windy conditions were a
problem for runners also. Pitt’s
Gary Siriano ﬁnished second in the

behind the winner from Bowling
Green. Siriano,’-s time was 14.30.1.

The Panther 400-meter relay of

; Panther decathelete Mike
Sapienza ﬁnished his Pitt career
with a fourth-place showing in, the
event. Ralph DiLuigi’s- ﬁfth-place
in the discus completed the
Panther scoring with a throw of 159
feet. V l
The University of Michigan won
the team title, followed by Toledo.
With the exception of Kinney’s

ei Pitt placed fifth last weekend at the Central Collegiatetrack championships.‘

_ winds gusting up to 30 miles per participation at NCAA’s, Pitt’s
3'99‘ p_i"‘°t9ighouriagainst,,theQthrowers. , 1979 collegiate season is over.

“Our goal was to place as many
people as we could within the top

{ten to ﬁfteen ﬁnishers,” said
{women ’ s track coach Alfreeda
Goff. ‘ “

In this, the Pantherettes were
successful, as one individual and
one relay team were top-ten
ﬁnishers at the Association of

Intercollegiate Athletics for
‘Women championships, held last
‘week at Michigan State. Pitt also -
placed two individuals in the top
-Vcﬁfteen.

Sophomore sprinter Gwen Mur- _V

ray was a ninth-place ﬁnisher in the

.400 meters. Despite being

Murray’s first season of running

—the open quarter-mile, she has

turned in times close to 53 seconds
flat and has received an invitation
to the Olympic trails.

Murray also ran the anchor 440
leg of the eighth-place 880-yard

.medley relay team, along with

Leslie Palmer (110), and Cissy
Wilborn (110) and Linda Mitchell
(220). The time of 1:44.7 in the
AIAW ﬁnals is a new ‘Pitt record for
880 yards.

Freshman shot putter Peri Jude

ﬁvRadecic was 13th in her event with

a throw of 46-8‘/4. High jumper

* Karen Krichko cleared 5-7 to ﬁnish

14th. Also competing were Caren
Scherich in the javelin and the
440?yard, relay team of Murray,
Palnier; Mitchell and Wilborn,

e, although the relayyvrwasgiisqualiﬁed 

in the semi—ﬁnals because of a lane
violation.

. “As a coach,” said Goff, “I feel
our athletes did a gﬁne "job.
You can only get better 7’with
competition like this, plus it was a
great experience for o’ur two
freshmen.’l

Team-wise, Pitt was scoreless,
as only top-six ﬁnishers earned
points at the AIAW track nationals.
On the whole, the East was
extremely successful as several
Eastern competitors placed well.

Morgan State was a winner in
the mile relay, with a time of 3:37;
the Morgan State medley relay
placed second. Villanova’s Brigid
Leddy was second in the 1500
meter in 4:17, while her two-mile

relay team also placed second.

The University of the District of
Columbia's Liz Young was a
second-place winner in both the
200-and 400-meter dashes, while
Temple's Edna Brown placed
second in the 400-meter hurdles.
Temple’s mile relay placed third,
while the Owls were ﬁfth in the 440
yard relay.

The meet was the conclusion to a
winning season for the Panther-
ettes. Last year, Pitt had been
9-2-1 with top-six team ﬁnishes at
both the indoor and outdoor
EAIAW meet championship meets.
This season, the team ﬁnished 8-1
overall (6-l outdoors) with ﬁfth°and
third-place team showings at the
Eastern indoor and outdoor

Championships, respectively.

   

Gwen Murray was ninth in the 400 meters at Nationals.
