New ID
policy to

 take effect

next week

By Julie Shepard

Assistant News Editor

Students who haven't had their
new ID taken yet may soon find

themselves faced with some in-

conveniences.

According to Veronica Hoff-
meyer, assistant registrar, ”The
new IDs are totally in effect this
term and should be used around
campus.”

Hoffmeyer also said that any-
one who doesn’t have a new ID

 yet can still get it taken at C1

Thackeray Hall for no charge.

”The whole process only takes
about five minutes, 10 at the
most, and you get your new ID
card right on the spot,” said Hoff-
meyer. She added that in order to
get your ID now, you need to
show a photo ID and proof that
your bill has been paid.

Even though the new IDs are in
effect, the Housing Office said
the old ones are still necessary for
residents to get into their dormi-
tories and for their meal plans in
the cafeteria. The use of the old
IDs in these instances will con-
tinue until the fall term when
policy will require the use of the

5. new IDs.

Many services on_ campus will
honor either the old or new IDs
as long as they are validated. The
ticket office in the WPU, the tick-
et takers at the games in the Field
House, the library and the book-
store will accept either ID as long
as a current validation sticker is
on it. E

The Parking Office has stated
that the old ID will only be ac-
ceptable on the campus bus un-
til Jan. 11 when the new one will
be required to ride the bus.

However, students are urged to
use their new IDs but to keep
their old ones available for use
throughout this term.

Western Pennsylvania's water
crisis eased yesterday after emer-
gency supplies were hooked up

«and a million-gallon oil spill

moved downstream into Ohio,
where the governor said more
than a million people could be af-
fected. , ‘

Ohio Gov. Richard Celeste
declared a state of emergency for
communities preparing to close
water intake pipes or step up
purification processes.

Partial water service was ex-
pected Wednesday afternoon in
Pittsburgh suburbs, where it was
cut off to about 15,000 people
Monday afternoon.

Meanwhile, the federal Bureau
of Standards entered the investi-
gation into Saturday's spill, which
occurred when an Ashland Oil
Co. tank collapsed along the
Monongahela River south of
Pittsburgh. ‘

”What we have there now is a
tank that cracked and moved off

its foundation by" 100 feet. It is*

cracked. It is collapsed. It is crum-

pled,” said Richard Wright of the
bureau's Center for Building
Technology,

Emergency crews numbed by
near-zero temperatures Wednes-
day vacuumed oil from the
Monongahela Riverand upper
Ohio River, formed by the
Monongahela and Allegheny at
Pittsburgh. The cleanup was ex-
pected to take weeks.

In Ohio, Celeste said the pol-
lution ’’will affect several
hundred thousand people initial-
ly in communities along the
Pennsylvania border, but if the oil
slick moves downriver toward

/ Cincinnati, we could see as many

as a million-plus people  have
their drinking water affected.”

The trouble was spreading
downstream along with a surface
slick estimated by the Ohio River
Sanitation Commission to be 28
miles long. Commission spokes-
woman Jeanne Ison said the slick,
which is breaking up, is accom-

Jackson to be sworn
in as SGB president

By Frances Sansig '
Managing Editor

Newly-elected Student Gov-
ernment Board president Craig
Jackson will be inaugurated
tonight in front of an audience of
over 100 student leaders and ad-
ministrators.

Jackson said he is anxious to
begin organizing the new Board.
”I’m glad to be back [from vaca-
tion]. I can't wait to start. We'll
be doing a lot of planning at a
retreat, and that's going to be a
lot of work right off the bat.”

Jackson will be officially sworn
in by. outgoing president Phil
Moyer and will then swear in the
othereight members of the Stu-
dent Government Board.

”We’ve beenwin limbo since
the elections,” said Jackson. Jack-
son emerged the winner in the
November elections by a 79 per-

cent victory over his opponent,
Robert Reddy.

panied by submerged, emulsified
oil running at least 16 feet deep.

The oil was expected to reach

.Wheeling, W.Va., 87 miles

downstream from Pittsburgh, ear-
Iy Thursday. City employees
rigged two pipelines across the
Ohio River to keep the water
flowing to 42,000 residents.

Toronto, Ohio, a town of about
7,000, was forced to close its in-
take Wednesday, said Richard
Shank, director of EPA for Ohio,
but East Liverpool was able to
turn its pumps back on.

Bob Conkle, East Liverpool's
water superintendent, said the
treated water would be as good
as it had always been. ”|t’ll be.
safe to drink or wash your clothes
with, or we wouldn't put it in the
|ine," he said.

Near Pittsburgh, water was to
begin flowing to low—|ying neigh-
borhoods first, with conditions
expected to be almost normal by
the weekend.

The news tantalized residents
with thoughts of normality.

. year

Jackson, a 21-year-old senior
majoring in business and politi-

cal science, said the most impor-

tant thing he plans to stress this
is communication. ”We
want to try to get students in the
Student Union and get them in-
volved. What I hope we can do
this year is try and improve the
quality of life of the students in
many aspects,” said Jackson.

Jeff Carpenter, chairman of the
Elections Committee, said the in-
auguaration marks the comple-
tion of his duties for the year.
”Everything went smoothly, and
I'd like to thank everyone who
helped.”

-New Student Government

Board members to be inauguarat- 7

ed in this evening's ceremony in
the William Pitt Union Ballroom
are Kent Baldauf, Daryl Grecich,

Curt Toll, Pamela Rich, Jon Scan-A,
Ion, Nan Beal, Kyle Durham and

Tanya Jackson. The board mem-
bers will serve a term of one year.

Emergency water reaches Pittsburgh

”I showered, shaved and
washed in two cups of water. I've
never done that before,” William
Banks, 57, said Tuesday night
while waiting to fill a tub and
buckets from a tank set up at a
Robinson Township fire hall.

A connection with neighboring
Moon Township would begin
supplying 700,000 gallons per
day, less than half Robinson's 1.5
million-gallon daily needs, said
authority office manager Alice
Kolec. Emergency supplies will
still be available.

The pollution was clearing on
the Monongahela River upstream
of Pittsburgh, allowing Western
Pennsylvania Water Co. to re-
sume treating water at a plant
closed by the spill. West Penn
had ordered 750,000 customers
to conserve and warned up to
50,000 of imminent shutoffs.

There was hope also for more
than 1,000_workers laid off by
employers who couldn't run fac-
tories without water or raw
materials carried by river barge.

Investigation into cause of oil spill starts up

HARRISBURG — A state
Senate committee will conduct
an investigation into laws dealing
with petroleum storage tanks in
the wake of a massive fuel spill
in Pittsburgh, the panel's chair-
man said Wednesday.

Sen. D. Michael Fisher, R-
Allegheny, said the Environmen-
tal Resources and Energy Com-
mittee would begin an immediate
review of the issue and may
schedule public hearings as ear-
ly as Jan. 14 in Western Penn-

_sylvania.

”We intend to thoroughly in-
vestigate this incident to deter-
mine if additional measures
could have prevented such a
devastating spill and find out

whether there is a need for

stronger state laws or heightened
enforcement,” said Fisher.

An Ashland Oil Co. fuel tank
collapsed Saturday night, spilling

1 about 1 million gallons into the

Monongahela River and tainting
water supplies. Ashland compa-
ny officials have said the tank was

built without written permits and
didn't undergo standard tests,
although they said there wasn't
any proof those problems caused
the accident.

"Human concerns come first at
a time like this, but the public
would become upset if we al-
lowed hundreds of waterfowl to
die,” Donald Madl, a Pennsylva-
nia Game Commission wildlife

Nearly 30 volunteers, three ex-

of the season gripped Penn-
sylvania.

A deep chill, extending from
the Midwest to the East, was ex-
pected to linger across Pennsyl-
vania with no end in sight to
bitterly cold temperatures.

In Philadelphia, where fore-
casters called for another cold
night of near-zero temperatures,
homeless people were expected

to again crowd into the shelter

placement service, which is find-
ing accommodations for 60 per-
cent more people this winter than
last.

Donald Feldman, intake super-
visor at the city's walk-in shelter
referral office, said all requests for
shelter were met Tuesday night at
the 175 shelters with about 7,500
beds. Early Wednesday, the low
was 8 degrees with a wind chill
of minus 20.

”People are staying as long as
they want [at shelters]," he said.

Philadelphia, the nation's fifth-
largest city with a population of
1.6 million, has between 6,000
and 16,000 homeless, according
to estimates.

2 health care giants

do battle over service

PHILADELPHIA -— Two health
care giants — U.S. Healthcare
Inc. and Blue Cross of Greater
Philadelphia — are arguing in
federal court about which system
provides the best service.

U.S. Healthcare sued Blue
Cross for $40 million in damages,
claiming that Blue Cross’ adver-
tisements last July for its Personal
Choice plan were fraudulent,
defamatory and malicious in their
treatment of health maintenance
organizations.

Healthcare President Leonard
Abramson, in testimony this
week, said the Blue Cross cam-
paign was a deliberate effort to
mislead the public and was a
desperate move to halt its decline
of subscribers.

U.S. Healthcare is the
dominant HMO in Pennsyslvania
and New Jersey with some
500,000 subscribers.

Mugged

Panthers can't escape Cap Centre jinx

By John Enright
Editor in Chief

LAN DOVER, Md.— There was
a fight at the Capital Centre last
night and a basketball game
broke out. And it was a very in-
tense,‘physical game which left
Pitt Coach Paul Evans furious.

Fisticuffs, numerous clock trou-
bles and five technical fouls high-
lighted the Big East opener for Pitt
and Georgetown as the Hoyas
prevailed, 62-57.

Pitt had pulled to within two
points, 58-56 with 2:09 left, on
two foul shots by guard Jason
Matthews.

But the Panthers (9-1 overall)
couldn't get the rebounds after
two Georgetown misses and Jer-
ome Lane was forced to foul
Hoya guard Charles Smith with
:29 left.

That's when Pitt Coach Paul
Evans exploded. Upset because
he thought the officials had
missed a traveling call on Bobby
Winston at midcourt, Evans ran
out of the coaches box and on to
the court.

Official Lary Lembo hit Evans
with his first technical foul of the
season for leaving the coaches
box. Official Jodi Silvester then

slapped Evans with another tech-‘

nical seconds later.

”The officials lost control of the
game and (Georgetown Coach)
John (Thompson) got away with
his intimidation tactics again.
He's more powerful than the (Ge-
orgetown) president and athletic
director,” Evans said.

Evans comment was in refer-
ence to Thompson's cancellation
of Georgetown Athletic Director
Francis Rienzo’s attempt to
schedule a game with Maryland.

After Evans’ technicals, Hoya
guard Charles Smith hit two of
four foul shots and Dwayne
Bryant added two more with :22
left, giving the Hoyas a 62-56
lead.

Matthews added Pitt's last
point of the game, making one of
two technical foul shots. Thomp-
son was assessed the technical af-
ter protesting the last of many
clock malfunctions in the game.

Georgetown is 10-1 and 1-0 in
the Big East.

‘and

The loss was Pitt's sixth loss in
as many attempts at the Capital
Centre.

”We weren't intimidated. We
just didn't come through
tonight,” Pitt forward Jerome
Lane said. ”We defintely wanted
to win here. I haven't won here
in my three years.”

Evans’ technicals may have
hurt Pitt, but the Panthers self-
destructed at the foul-line. Pitt
shot 16 of 32 from the line. The
worst violators were Lane (0-5)
and Sean Miller (3-6).

”Our foul shooting hurt us. We
never shot this poorly,” Lane

said. ”We still should have won

the game.”

Georgetown was nine of 23 for
39 percent from the line.

Georgetown led at halftime,
32-26, as Pitt center Charles
Smith sat out 13:44 of the first
half with three fouls.

The most excitement in the en-
tire game occurred with 11:27 re-
maining in the first half when a
fight broke out near the Geor-
getown foul line.

With the Hoyas lea.ding 14-9,
Georgetown guard Mark Tillmon
fouled Nate Bailey after a missed
foul shot. Tillmon pushed Bailey
tempers flared. Lane
punched Tillmon and the Geor-
getown bench cleared.

Lane was taken to the ground
by Highsmith, who. weighs 235
pounds. .

Said Lane: ”lt’s all in the phys-
ical aspects of the game. I was

just trying to help my teammate

and someone attacked me.”

Tillmon was assessed a per-
sonal foul, a technical foul and
was ejected from the game. Ge-
orgetown was assessed a techni-
cal foul for leaving the bench.

Thompson and the fans were
furious Lane wasn't ejected.

The fight got Pitt back in the
game. Miller hit three of four
technical foul shots and Lane
scored in the paint tying the game
at 14.

In the next three minutes Ge-
orgetown outscored Pitt 10-3 to
open up a 24-17 lead.

Highsmith and freshman for-
ward Anthony Tucker sparked
the run, scoring two baskets each.

But Pitt battled back. The Pan-

thers scored the game's next nine
points to take a 26-24 lead. With
Smith on the bench, freshman
Bobby Martin scored five points
on the nine—point run. Lane ad-
ded four points with a nifty
reverse lay-in from Gore and a
jumper.

However the Hoyas got the

next spurt, scoring the last six -

points of the half.

During the second half, the.

Panthers last lead was 48-47 on

two foul shots by Smith.
Georgetown’s Smith hit a

three-pointer and a jumper to

give the Hoyas a 52-47 ad-
vantage.

The Panthers could have tied
the game but couldn’t'rebound
two Georgetown shots. Evans’
technicals soon followed.

Maravich remembered by ex-teammates

BEAVER, Pa. (AP) ~ Pete
Maravich, in a 1974 interview
with the Beaver County Times,
said, ’’I don't want to play 10
years in the NBA and die of a
heart attack at age 40.”

He played pro ball for exactly

10 years and died Tuesday at age _

40.

”That’s a little scary,” said
sports writer Andy Nuzzo, who
had interviewed Maravich when
he played for the Atlanta Hawks.

”The story was laying on my

desk when I got to work [Wed-

nesday]. I read it and read it and
readit and read it. I couldn't be-
Iieve it. Everything matched.”
Nuzzo was assigned the 1974’
story because Maravich, who was

born and spent his childhood in
the area, ”was unhappy about the
fan reaction he was getting, un-
happy that he was being labeled
a hot dog,” he said.

’’It was right after that fan had
displayed that sign, the one that
said, ‘Pistol Pete, why do hot
dogs cost $2 million in Atlanta
and 50 cents in Philadelphia?’

”He had only been playing [in
the NBA] for four years, and he
was saying he didn't need basket-
ball, that he could do something
else.”

Maravich, the greatest scorer in
major college basketball history
and an NBA Hall of Famer, col-
lapsed and died of an apparent

heart attack while playing a pick-
up, half-court game in Pasadena,
Calif.

Best known for his floppy white
socks, his Beatles-style haircut
and dazzling showmanship,
Maravich ”was a player ahead of
his time,” said Billy Zopf, who
played for Duquesne University
against LSU in 1968.

”He was 6-foot-5 and a guard.
There are a lot of guards that size
now, but hewas one of the few
players who could do all the ball-
handling tricks ‘and still was a
good ballplayer,” Zopf said. ”Not
only did he have the skills, he
could apply them on the court.
That was the difference.”

Other Western Pennsylvania
teammates, opponents and
friends of Maravich were stunned
at his death.

Maravich was born in Aliquip-
pa, Pa., when his father coached
there but moved away at age nine
when Press Maravich got the
Clemson coaching job.

”Nobody wants to die, but if he
had to pick a way to die, I'm sure
Pete would have picked playing
basketball," said Rich Lupcho of
Hopewell, Pa., who played three
seasons with Maravich at Loui-
siana State.

’’Basketball was Pete's life.”
Maravich scored 3,667 points
and averaged 44.2 points per

game in three LSU seasons, both
NCAA records, although the
Tigers ”were just an average ball-
c|ub,” according to Lupcho.
”But no matter where we
played, everybody came to see
Pete.”
Paul

Milanovich, another

_Beaver County native who

played at LSU, said he was
”shocked, very shocked” to learn
of Maravich’s death, since he had
just talked to him several days
before.

Art Hershkovitz, a Hopewell
attorney who negotiated
Maravich’s first pro contract, said
”he couldn't believe it was true

—— I didn't want anybody to tell '

me it was true."

Lady Panthers playing well
as Big East action begins

By Matt Martin
Assistant Sports Editor

The Pitt Lady Panthers basket-
ball team completed a successful
holiday campaign, earning a 5-2
December record and a 6-4 over-
all ledger.

The Lady Panthers" opened
their four-game winter stand with
an 85-69 victory over Duquesne
at Fitzgerald Field House on Dec.
11, followed by an 81-69 road
victory over Kent State. Pitt junior
forward Deidra Baker scored 17
points and pulled down .12 re-
bounds against the Lady Flashes.

Head coach Kirk Bruce's squad
returned home for a Dec. 22
matchup with Youngstown State
University. Five-foot—11 junior

forward Lorri Johnson paced Pitt
with 19 points, and senior for-
ward Sally Sheerer added 14 in
a 71-64 Pittsburgh victory.

A Dec. 30 trip to Altoona High
School was next on the schedule
as the Lady Panthers faced a

- tough West Virginia team. Play-

ing before a hometown crowd,
Shingler scored 13 points in a
tight, 63-62 West Virginia win.
The loss snapped a four-game Pitt
winning streak.

Pitt opened up the new year
with its first Big East game of the
season at Providence College.
Despite 18 points by Johnson and

17 by Shingler, the Lady Friars -

scored an 86-78 victory and
dropped Pitt to 0-1 in league

play.

INTERESTED IN THE  
OPPORTUNITIES THAT COME
WITH STARTINGYOUR OWN,

FRATERNITY?

Next on the Panther agenda
will be a Jan. 7 game at Boston

College in what will be BC’s third

Big East matchup. Through the
first seven games of the season,

Boston College placed four play-

ers in the Top 20 league individu-
al scorers.

LADY PANTHER NOTES: Pitt
needs only one more victory to

. tie last season's seven-win record,

a season which saw them lose 21
games  The Lady Panther’s two
December losses were to local
rivals Penn State and'West Vir-
ginia by a combined total of three
points  Through the first seven
games of the season, the Lady
Panthers led all Big East teams in
3-point field goal shooting, con-
verting 10 of 22 (45.5 percent)

The Pitt News cheers the
return of Showcase magazine

- By Susan Washburn

Showcase Editor

Last September, the editors of
The Pitt News as well as its loyal
readers mourned the death of a
friend. Showcase, the popular en'-
tertainment supplement, was laid
to rest because of injuries sus-
tained when the newspaper be-
gan appearing four days a week.

Showcase lay buried for four
months when a miracle occurred.
It was brought back to life by the
editor in chief, otherwise known
as God. The revived Showcase

6 will appear in public each Thurs-

day along with the rest of The Pitt
News. In this new life, Showcase

has vowed to make an attempt to
repent her previous sins.

Showcase has been seen with
such scurrilous characters as The
Hard-Ons and The Butthole Surf-
ers and is also known to frequent
the dorm rooms of many Pitt stu-
dents. Some have even found her
lying on her back waiting for yet
another willing reader to pick her
up. ,

There are serious doubts,
however, as to the probability of
finding a new style of existence.
Like so many people, Showcase
is set in her ways and will make
only minor adjustments as those
who influence her existence
change.

Earth.Sun.Moon lyrics too simple

Love And Rockets
Earth.Sun.Moon
Big Time Records

Lucky us. -

While many bands usually
refrain from offering their legion
of admirers printed lyrics, Love
And Rockets has done this and
more.

Someone Xeroxed the shards of

paper on which David J and
Daniel Ash scribbled down the
lyrics. An artsy record exec then
decided to hastily smush the
sheets onto the back of the album
jacket and, voila, we see lyrics in
their virgin form.
» On ”No New Tale To Tell,”
the band's chart-busting college
radio hit, some words are
scratched out and replaced with
unforgettable phrases such as
”our little lives get complicated,”
and ”it’s all the same thing.”

For some reason, it annoys the
bejeesus out of me to perceive
my life, or anyone else’s life, as
”little.” That word isn't the one

I would choose to accurately
describe existence on this planet.
Especially if my word choice was

being sealed for all eternity on

vinyl.

Putting the original lyric sheets
on display is kind of like seeing
the band with no clothes on.
Things they tried to cover up are
in plain view, and there are things
they should have tried to cover
up but didn't.

I don't think any poet would
wantthe world to see the first
drafts of poems that were later
changed, but from the looks of
- of ~ the songs on
Earth.Sun.Moon., the authors
didn't lose any sleep writing re-
visions.

The lyrics are simple, which is
particularly aggravating since
Love And Rockets seems to covet
the image of a devilish, mysteri-
ous rock entity. But the band
comes off as know-it-all pseudo-
philosophers.

That's too bad, since musical-
ly, the LP is diverse and great fun

to listen to.

“No New Tale To Tell” has a
catchy, acoustic rhythm that
makes the song bearable despite
David J's attempt to discover the
meaning of life.

”Mirror People” is the LP’s
most memorable song with a
frightening guitar rhythm backed
by eerie (although mostly inane)
lyrics.

"Lazy” is one of the most sim-
ple and boring arrangements in
the history of pop music. For-
tunately, it breaks up the album
and is a relief from today's alter-
native music (which is usually
smothered by toxic synthesizers).

This song is a prime example
of this band's complex lyrical
structures, lyrics that could sure-
ly stand up as works of art
without backing rhythms:

L, Lazy/You drive me crazy/Love is
hazy/So let me go.

Actually, I'm being rather
harsh. It sounds good.And you
should see the videos.

Undoubtedly, you're sitting
there wondering what the devil

. this column is going to be about,

which is natural because many of
you have never seen this column
before.

Once upon a time, an ingeni-
ous Pitt News writer decided to
add a new twist to the idea of a
”singles” column. Instead of
matching swinging singles
together via computer, he
listened to the radio and criti-
cized the songs he heard. L

With the decline of the 45 and-
the slow rise of the cassingle
(with the CD single just over the

important so that you don't waste
your precious dollars. And that's
where I come in.

Since most of you decide to
whether or not to buy an album,
cassette, or CD on the basis of a

song or two, you're probably go- ‘

ing to need help discerning the
decent music from the drivel.

George Harrison "Got My
Mind Set On You."

God, do I hate this song This
song is perhaps THE definition of
unadulterated radio drivel. Ge-

Debbie Gibson
Love."

Now this is a pop song I can
deal with. Gibson's voice is in-
credible, and she shows a
remarkable talent at inflecting just
the right words so as to create a
mood in her song as opposed to
just singing them. Gibson's mus-
ic comes across so playfully that
it's hard not to like it.

Another good thing about Gib-
son is that she writes all her own
material, a sure indication that
she'll be around when Tiffany's
working behind a counter in one
of the mall's she sings in.
