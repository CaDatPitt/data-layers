George ’s Our Presi  
«Republican Bush takes Presidency inlandslide victory

By Scot Ross

News Editor

During his acceptance speech
last night, Republican President-
Elect George Bush pledged to
”keep the conversation going”
between himself and the Ameri-
can people. '

Assured his victory at approxi-

.mately II p.m. according toiexit

polls, the Vice President stood
before a cheering Houston
crowd, informing the audience
Democratic candidate Michael
Dukakis had conceded the
election.

Dukakis conceded his defeat to
Bush over the telephone from

 Boston and said to a nationally
' televised rally that the nation

would have to work together to
solve America's problems.

’’I want you to know [Dukakis]
was most gracious. His call was
personal, it was genuinely friend-
ly and itjwas in the great tradition
of American politics,’’ Bush said.

”We can now speak the most
majestic words a democracy has
to offer,” Bush said. ”The people
have spoken.”

Bush said, ”It’s occurred to me
that what we were having, the
people of America and I, was a
conversation. A back andforth. A
mutual dialogue. And it cannot
go» away, not now, not when I
need it most." -

Bush thanked the American
people, as well he made special
mention of Ronald Reagan who
he thanked for ”turning our coun-
try around and for being my

friend and for going the extra‘ 7

mile.” This, he said, was just like

. Reagan to do.

He added that the President
was ’’simply one of the most de-

PHILADELPHIA — Republican
George Bush overcame big
Democratic majorities in
Philadelphia and Pittsburgh Tues-
day night to defeat Democrat
Michael Dukakis for Pennsylva-
nia's 25 electoral votes.

0 Bush's victory came as he

closed the‘ gap the Massachusetts
governor had built during the
night until about 10:30 p.m.
when the tide shifted.

By then the vote_s from
Philadelphia nearly complete,
where,Dukakis won by some
228,000 votes, and from Alleghe-

C

cent men I have ever met.”

”This is a moving night for all
of us,” Bush said, ”and you can't
help but be moved when your
country endorses your hopes and
your candidacy and the feelings
are so personal that the decision
is larger than that, and now we
will again, for an America that is
strong and resolute in the world.

”Strong and big hearted at
home, and when I said I want a
kinder, gentIer.nation I meant it,
and I mean it.” I

Bush tried to separate his elec-
tion fromthe negative campaign
that ensued between him and
Dukakis.

The Vice President said, ”A
campaign is a disagreement, and
disagreements divide. But, and
election is a decision, and deci-
sions clear the way for harmony
and peace. And I mean to be a
President of all the people and I
wantto work for the hopes and
interests, not only of my support-
ers, but of the Governor’s and of
those who didn't vote at all.

f’To those who supported me,
I will try to be worthy of your trust
and to those who did not, I will
try to earn it and my hand is out
to you, and I want to be your
President, too,” he said.

He thanked his running mate,
Indiana Senator Dan Quayle,
who did not attend the accep-
tance speech, rather he was in
Washington, D.C., accepting his
election as Vice President.

”The only thing I can say is that
you did it, we did it and George
Bush did it,” said Quayle.

”Thank you very much. You
have truly made this the most
memorable night of our lives and
believe me... we will never for-
get his night. We won’t forget

ny County, including Pittsburgh,
which Bush lost by nearly
115,000.

After that, slowly and relent-
lessly, the votes from Republican
counties started coming in, trim-
ming the Dukakis margin until
the battle was virtually dead-
locked.

With 91 percent of the 9,423
precincts reported Bush had
pulled ahead with 1,990,346
votes to 1,974,795 for Dukakis,
with most of the remaining votes
still out in normally Republican
counties.

At that point Bush was ahead

in 52 of the state's 67 counties. I

The Bush victory came after

what you did for me and what
you have done for George Bush,”
he said.

Quayle was very thankful to
the people who helped behind
the scenes of the Bush-Quayle
ticket.

He said, ”For nearly three
months sinceour convention in
August, we have witnessed first-
hand the dedication and profes-

xsionalism of literally thousands of

supporters, volunteers and staff
members everywhere, through
38 states and for more than 235
separate appearances.”

’’I think we in Washington
ought to let them hear us in
Houston, Texas.”

QuayIe’s seat in the senate-will

lnow be up for appointment.

Bush spoke of Michael Dukakis
during his speech. He said that he
knew how Dukakis felt, having
lost elections himself along the
way.

”We both went into the arena,

and we fought long and hard and
the Governor can great satisfac-

I tion that his valiant family... did

him proud,” he said.
”And now I know that we'll

come together as we always =

have, 200 years of harmony in
the oldest, greatest democracy in
man's time on earth.

’’I mean to keep the conversa- ‘

tion going, to keep ‘walking
towards you, talking with you
and reaching for the hands, and
another thing, I'll do my level-
best to reach out and work con-
structively with the United States
Congress," he continued.

The Vice President has planned

. a Wednesday morning press con-

ference, after which he will return
to Washington.

Dukakis conceded defeat to Bush
in his national quest for the
presidency, and while Bush was
heralding his election as the next
occupant of the White House.

Dukakis’ lead fell off as votes
came in from rural counties and
from the Republican counties that
surrounded the strongly-
Democratic cities, though Bush's
edge was less than President
Ronald‘ Reagan's 356,000-vote
defeat of Democrat Walter Mon-
dale in 1984.

Five minority party candidates,
led by the Consumer's Eugene
McCarthy who failed to win the
Democratic nomination 20 years
ago, weren't counted in the ear-

Pa. voter turnout numbers much higher than estimated Q

By Ted Duncombe

Associated Press Writer

PHILADELPHIA -— Contrary to
national projections, voters in
Pennsylvania turned out in large
numbers Tuesday Efelect a presi-
dent, U.S. senator, congressmen
and several state officials.

The presidential race was the
big drawing card, although local
contests and initiatives added in-
terest in several areas, election
officials said.

The weather, which started
sunny in most parts of the state,
began to cloud over as the day
wore on, creating uncertainty
about the effect on evening tur-
nout, traditionally one of the
heaviest periods.

But observers said they expect-
ed final numbers to match tur-
nouts for previous elections in
presidential years.

’’If you go back over the last
five presidential elections, there
is a consistency that appears in
terms of turnout,” said Frederick
L. Voigt, executive secretary of
the non-partisan Committee of

‘Seventy in Philadelphia. ”This

one appears to be part of that
pattern."

’’It’s been very busy,” said Lois
Miller, judge of elections in
Millersburg’s 2nd Ward, where
the ballot included a non—binding
referendum on whether a curfew
should be imposed on people
younger than 18.

In Phoenixville, election offi-
cials said the turnout was better
than they had seen in years.
”We’ve seen a lot of new faces
here today,” said poll worker
Eleanor Griffith.

”Some precincts are averaging
100 an hour where they have
registrants of 1,400 or 1,500,”

 

D 31 Guest

said Florindo Fabrizio, Erie
County clerk of elections.

Voters had to wait up to a half
hour at many rural and suburban
locations in Lancaster County,
while a heavy turnout also was
reported from the Monongahela
Valley south of Pittsburgh to
Reading in southeastern Penn-
sylvania.

Voigt predicted a turnout ap-
proaching the 72 percent record-
ed in Philadelphia during the
1984 presidential election. He
said it appeared to be strong in
predominantly black wards as
well as in white wards.

A few problems had been
reported, mostly with machine
openings early in the day and
with names left off voting records,
Voigt said.

”There may be a few more this
time than the last presidential
election, but there's no patterns

and no apparent correlations be-
tween the problems that are oc-
curring and candidates,” he said.

Jim Scanlon, director of the Al-
legheny County Elections Board,
said voting was on the heavy side
in Pittsburgh.

”We’ve averaged about 83 per-
cent turnout on these elections
over the last 40 years, and I'm
predicting about an 80 percent of
all registered voters in Allegheny
County.”

At West Pennsboro Township
in Cumberland County, election
judge Larry Jones said, ”lt’s kind
of an All-American pie at-
mosphere here. People seem
kind of excited about the elec-
tion, surprisingly."

Not all voters were enthusias-
tic about the major-party candi-
dates for president, Republican
George Bush and Democrat
Michael Dukakis.

‘provost

defends
SEI

By Jim Tezak

Sta ff Writer

Carnegie Mellon University
Provost Angel Jordan said Mon-
day that he had ”no apologies”
for his role in securing military
research contracts for Carnegie
Mellon, including those related to
Star Wars.

Jordan acknowledged that be-
tween 1983 and 1986 Carnegie
Mellon accepted no less than six

research contracts related to the

Strategic Defense Initiative, com-
monly known as Star Wars. CMU
received $385,000 in Star Wars
money in 1987.

It is not yet clear which school
at CMU is conducting the SDI
research. Protesters claim that the
university's new Software En-
gineering lnstitute is doing the
research, while CMU officials say
that the work is being done at
CMU’s Robotics Institute.

Jordan did, however, admit that
SEI was conducting military
research funded by Department
of Defense agencies.

Vince Eirene, who has helped
organize protests against SEI in
the past, went further, saying that
SE1 has become "the brains of the
military.” Eirene compared SE1 to
the gas chambers at Auschwitz,
Germany during World War II.

”We’re not going to have geno-
cide, the destruction of a race;
were going to have omnicide,
the destructionbf everything,” he
said. ”That makes Auschwitz
look like a dress rehearsal.”

Jordan defended SEl’s involve-
ment with the Department of
Defense, saying that CMU and
other universities are a strong part
of the research community, and

as such, have a responsibility to
participate in ”the system."

”lf the process is no good, then
change it through due
process,” Jordan said.

Jordan also noted that the ad-
ministration does not force
faculty members to do military
research.

”We open doors, and we find
opportunities, but we do not
command the faculty members to
write a particular program for a
particular agency,” Jordan said.
He noted that several faculty
members of CMU’s computer
science department have
declined to participate in military-
funded research.

Most faculty members do mili-
tary research because they ”want

”Knock you up in the morn-

”Yes, at about 9 a.m.,” she

answer, she continued. ”I
wouldn't ask, except my alarm
clock is broken.”

In England, the phrase ”knock

up — that and nothing more.

passed, I realized there are many

phrases that the two countries

share which are different in
meaning.

Usually, I wasn't told about
these ancipital meanings until I
made an embarrassing mistake.

he could borrow a ”rubber," I

When a friend teetered up to

”I’rn pissed,” I immediately
asked her what she was angry

Only after she stared at me with

”pissed” in England was to be in-
toxicated.

I spent 10 minutes walking

back and forth, looking for the j

Democrats must learn

to manage campaigns

Last night, George Bush became the 41st president of
the United States, and the Democratic Party lost its third
straight presidential election. Why? Just ask Bush's cam-

paign manager.

Last spring, it appearedgthe Democratic party had found
a winner in Michael Dukakis. Following the’ Democratic
National Convention, Dukakis led national polls by a sig-
nificant margin. This effect is not unusual in the aftermath
of national convention. However, the Democrats seemed
more united than they did eight years ago, and at the time
of the Republican National Convention, Dukakis main-
tained his advantage in the polls. I

Unfortunately for Dukakis, the momentum didn't last.

Bush's campaign analyzed his opposition perfectly and
established a series of attacks to shed a negative light on

T the Democratic candidate. Regardless of whether the at-

tacks were relevant to the election is a moot point. They

were effective.

- Because Dukakis failed to address these attacks, the

‘ American public became increasingly confused. Bush's

aggressiveness capitalized on these doubts.

By the time Dukakis counterattacked, it was the eve of
Election Day and just too late.

There are more registered Democrats than Republicans,
yet the Democratic party has failed to put a presidentin
officevin 12 years. lfthe Democrats hope to win in 1992,
they must not let themselves be outmaneuvered during
that campaign. They will have to learn how to play the

political game.‘

The West's money is

As the Soviet Union and
Eastern Bloc countries experience
serious economic problems, the
leaders of those countries are
turning for relief not to the prin-

_ ciples of Karl Marx but those of

the capitalistic West. Western
bankers seem all too willing to
prop them up with low—interest
loans and liberal lines of credit.

Even in Yugoslavia, which had

. been considered one of com-

munism’s showpieces, dissident
Milovan Djilas recently observed,
”Communism isn't changing. It's
disintegrating.” "inflation in Yu-
goslavia stands now at 217 per-
cent. ‘ The government has
approved price increases of up to
53 percent on meat and 60 per-
cent on bread.

There have been rumblings in
Moscow that the Soviet Union
will soon be increasing prices on
similar staple items.

_g At a time when the West ought
to be celebrating communism’s
economic decline, many West-
ern countries are foolishly rush-

ing in to save these countries
from financial ruin.

Moscow has accepted billions
of dollars in new credit from
Italian and German banks and is
negotiating for more from Japan
and Britain. The Soviets are also
reported to be thinking about en-
couraging more foreign business
partners and letting them own
c()ntr()lling interest in joint
ventures.

”Four more years.”

That's what the front page read

Pitt News. (The rest of the page
was completely black.) And that's
how some of us are feeling today.

Well, it's all over now. I mean
that in a deliberately ominous
way, since I am a Democrat.

And like a lot of other
Democrats I know, I’m contem-
plating the state of the nation dur-
ing the four years to come.

I'm wondering, ”Will my finan-
cial aid carry into the next term?”

I know, I know. I just made a
terrible mistake. I've branded my-
self a liberal. What a fatal term.
It killed Dukakis, anyway.

What kills me is the fact that it's
considered a fault to be a mem-
ber of the ACLU. Since when is
it wrong to want to defend civil

liberties? That's a sad reflection
on our society, I think.

On the other hand, Reaganom-
ics is the right idea. Yeah, right.

What appeals to the voter —i

outrageous spending without tax-
es to substantiate it - seems
completely illogical to me. I'm
wondering how long that system
can possibly last. (Though the
deficit convinces me that it won't
last long.)

Before any loans, credits or

Soviet defense spending has dou-
bled under Gorbachev. In their

clear they have no intention of

will continue at its present 3 per-
cent real growth.

In making these loans and
granting credits, Western banks
are taking the risks away from the
Soviets and transferring them to
the Western bank depositors.
Banks are pricing their credit (as
low as 7 to 10 percent in the case
of the Italians) not on the basis of
Soviets’ ability to repay but on the
economic strength of Western
governments. The banks can't
lose, because the Western

THE PITT NEWS

Tuesday, 7:75 p.m.

During the presidential cam-
paign, George Bush made a state-
ment which I predict will go
down in history in much the
same way castor oil goes down
the throat of a 6-year-old child.

Taunted by questions about a
barking deficit, defense project
overruns and tax reform which
(surprise!) has made the rich

_ richer, he said on television -

’’'Read... my... lips... No... new...

Now, I've seen the tape of that
speech about a dozen times, and
I've tried to read his lips. It's a lit-
tle like reading the lips of a ven-
triloquist’s dummy: You see the
lips moving and hear the words

I 'coming from the lips, but the uni-

ty of lips and words seems some-
how a little off, like a badly
dubbed Chinese movie.

‘ What I read when I read
George Bush's lips in that film
loop are the words: ”Mondale...
told... the... truth... and... look...
where... it... got... him.” A one-
way ticket to Palookaville, that's
where. So George Bush would
no more say that the only way to
balance a budget is to raise taxes
than Michael Dukakis would,
though Dukakis had the good

The food

As students, we are forced to
deal with long hours of studying,
stressful exams, small budgets,
romance problems and home-
sickness. Yet, if this pressure isn't
sufficient, the Litchfield Towers’
cafeteria policy has graciously
provided us with the aggravation

.of breakfast, lunch and dinner.

When I submitted my $492
meal plan check, I assumed I
would no longer have to be con-
cerned with keeping myself
nourished with a well—balanced
diet. The cafeteria would take
care of everything. All I had to do

' was show my student I.D., pick

up a tray and indulge in an assort-

‘ .-ment of healthy, tasty dishes

complemented with a salad bar
and a soft ice cream machine.
What could possibly go wrong?

It ail started when I saw the
food. Food has a broad definition,
and the cafeteria seems to be
working by its own dictionary. I

....it usual

In the I‘/2 years I have been a
student at Pitt, one of the biggest
gripes that fellow students have
had is with the cafeteria.

I, of course, have tasted some
of the cuisine that it serves.

Serving several thousand peo-
ple is a difficult task, and I tip my
cap to the people who attempt to
do so every day.

Now, to begin the fray!

0 Ever taken a close look at the
stuff they put in the seafood
bisque and the seafood surprise?
If that is real crab and real shrimp,
then it is some pretty sick
seafood. I'm betting it is an amaz-
ingly bad imitation.

3 Then there are those wonder-
ful grilled cheese sandwiches.
You can almost taste the
cholesterol dripping from them.

_ And they let us have two of them!

0 One of my favorite dishes, in

sense not to comment on the sub-
ject in such a way that it would
get repeated over and over on
network specials about the elec-
tion. Dukakis simply said that he
had no plans to raise taxes, would
do it only as an extreme last
resort, and had other ways to
balance the budget. That is much
more sensible, but it's also much
less quotable and much less cer-
tain to appeal to voters who
wanted to hear someone say
"NO NEW TAXES."

HARRY
KLOMAN

Now that George Bush has
been named the 41st president
by a jury of his peers, I want to
know exactly how he plans to
balance the budget without rais-
ing taxes. He has nothing_ to lose,
unless, of course, he considers
the s|im‘possibility that the Elea-
toral College members would

ply Pitt's large student bodywith

cafeteria must sacrifice appear-

leg. \

When faced with the un-
familiar, many students have
learned techniques of survival.
One strategy is to keep your at-
tention on the people ahead of
you in line. If they're willing to
risk selecting the main course,
chances are it's a good bet. One
doesn't even need to know what
the dish is called on the menu.
The’ standard request of "I'll take
the same thing,” is widely accept-
ed among the cafeteria person-
nel. If you're holding your nose
and mouth, just point.

Eventually, one learns to over-
come the“ need to see what he or
she is eating. However, the

all seriousness, was the Swedish
meatballs on egg noodles. They
haven't had them in over a
month. Instead, they've had beef
tips. \

0 The most bizarre food I at-
tempted to eat was what I thought

in December for the‘

plummage and court Lady
Liberty. George Bush will step
down then and return to Ken-
nebunkport to get some use out
of the summer place before he
has to turn it over to his next
generation.

But something odd hasn't hap-
pened in this presidential elec-
tion. George Bush hasn't begun
to look presidential. He hasn't be-
gun to take on that glorious sta-
ture even a tiny man like Gerald
Ford took on when he had great-
ness thrust upon him. I read a
book once where someone
referred to someone else as a
”corpulent little toad.” I've al-
ways wanted to use the phrase
but have never had occasion. If
nothing else, I'll always thank
George Bush for the opportunity.

But now I stoop to insults! Will
anyone take me seriously! Hell,
yes. For, in_lesjs than one year, I
believe the American presidency
will be in its lowest moments
since the day Chester Alan Arthur
assumed the presidency follow-
ing the death of the guy who
served before him. I believe that
George Bush will spend the next
four years waving his resume
around and talking about how ex-
perienced he is, whﬂe his cabi-
net robs the national treasury and

cafeteria still provides further ob-
stacles.

In order to be fair, the cafeter-
ia has established the policy of
providing only one serving per
student until all those in line are
catered to. It sounds constitution-
al except when servings consti-
tute only six soggy chicken

was salisbury steak but ended up
being a softversion of a cow turd.

0 The pizza is one of the best
things they have down here (af-
ter you towel off the grease).
That's why the line is always be-
yond the Cathedral.

0 The uncooked stuff, like the
salad bar, cake and other des-
serts, the cereal, and the ice
cream, is a big plus for the
cafeteria. The salad bar could be
a little fresher on some days, as
well as the cake, but the ice is
very cold.

0 During Passover last spring,
the cafeteria seemed to make
some attempt to have some meals
without any bread in them, but
they failed more times than they
succeeded. I ended up eating
salad and ice cream more than
once.

Wednesday, November 9, I988‘

Bush's presidency will be as lame as his campaign

pillages the national psyche. For
if Ronald Reagan — with his
strong positives and his image as
a benevolent leader — couldn't
inspire his men to do honest and
moral things for the Gipper, then
how can an amphibian like
George Bush keep warts from
forming on his presidency? He
just can't do it. He just can't.

I don't know if ‘ Michael
Dukakis could have done it
either, for electing a new presi-
dent is always a risk. (In Reagan's
case, we found that e-|ecting"an
experienced president was a risk,
too.) But George Bush is a proven
nobody, a clear and inarguable
nonentity, which Dukakis has yet
to prove about himself. I voted for
the possibility that Dukakis had
something and against the cer-
tainty that Bush had nothing, and
lots of it. ‘ ’

This is what I wonder: How do
people like George Bush’ rise to
national prominence? He served
one term in Congress, lost a bid
for re-election and then took on
a series of government jobs
which, when done correctly, re-
quire absolutely no skill what-
soever. Andrew Young proved
the drawbacks of having an intel-
ligent U.N. ambassador, which ,
perfectly suited George Bush for

nuggets and the lines are 20 feet

long.

Some students attempt to fool
the system. When faced with the
choices of beef stew or fried fish,
one may ask for a little of both.
Unfortunately, the cafeteria is a
clever operation and now denies
students the opportunity to over-
lap their meals.

At times, one may get lucky
and enter a short line. With 15
minutes to eat‘ before class, this
could be a valuable opportunity.
The logical behavior for a hungry
student would be for him to wait
in line, fill his plate, and move to
the end of the line for more. Sor-
ry folks, I tried it and it doesn't
work.

It was 1:30 p.m., and the lunch"
was called Ham and Cheese
Sandwich. I was permitted to
receive one sandwich but was re-
jected when I asked for a scoop
of rice. That was strictly designat-

served grilled ham and cheese
sandwiches. There are Jewish ta-
boos against eating ham, meat
and milk and, of course, bread for
Passover. That's triple blas-
phemy! ‘

0 I haven't mentioned breakfast
yet, so here it goes: Why do the
potatoes taste different every day?
Why are the eggs so runny? Why
don't we have sausage more
often? Boy, it's good to get that
off my chest.

0 One good thing about break-
fast: the make—your—own—eggs.
Good idea.

0 The biggest problem, in my
mind, is the time the cafeteria is
open — from 4 to 6 p.m. This is
absolutely ridiculous. Most of us
would like to eat around 7 p.m.
How about 4 to 7 p.m.?

0 Have any of you freshmen
noticed that everybody goes to

.One way is

the job. William Casey showed
the danger in having a skilled
spook_running the CIA, which
again meant George Bush could
do it. And do I need to recite the
list of incompetent vice presi-
dents or remind you that no sit-
ting vice president -— a’ funny
phrase, for what else does he
have to do? — has moved direct-
ly into the presidency since the
early 19th century? _

So now what do we do? How
do we survive the next four years?
(I almost wrote ”how do we on
the left survive," but I think
George Bush ‘will be everybody’s
hemorrhoid before he's cured.)
to hold our
Democrats in Congress account-
able for their votes and make
them make it difficult for George
Bush to continue to perpetrate
the ”Reagan agenda." Or we
may justtconsiderl the next four
years a superb opportunity to stay
exceptionally drunk on whatever‘
gets us there — rum, IC Light, Fel-

lini movies, Lucy reruns, USA To-

day, you name it.
Then again, maybe that's what
got us here in the first place.

the cafeteria is nearly empty,

really nice to the people serving

us and not give them a hard time. '

They don't make the rules on
how much to serve or what to
serve with what, so try and be
cool. As it is now, plenty of them
are quite grumpy. Maybe bring a
rose to give to one of them (if you

why are the chunks of tuna in the

the swiss steak?

It's just a little hard to swallow.

Women's swim team wins first two meets '

By Ed Kuznik

Staff Writer

Pittsburgh's women's swim-
ming team began their newest
season in predictable fashion,
burying Duquesne and Syracuse
to get off to a fast start in 1988.

The Syracuse meet was an im-
portant point in the season in that
the New York team was sup-
posed to be one of Pitt's biggest
challenges for Big East suprema-
cy. When the final event was
recorded last Friday, though, the
Lady Panthers had badly beaten

them by‘a score of 176-117.

"We very much dominated the
meet,” Pitt coach David Be—
lowich said. ''I have a mechan-
ism to go to an exhibition rating
with some of the events, and I did
that. Otherwise, the score really
could have been anything we
wanted it to be."

Sophomore Celeste Makiel,

. freshman Noelle Barry, junior

Sandy Albright and frosh Laura
Lee Sullivan led the way for the

* winners, as they were all a signifi-

cant part of two victories.

Riddick fills holes for
Panthers as a member

of defensive backfield

By Vince "Carey

Sports Editor
After last season, the Pitt

coaches decided to move full-
back Louis Riddick back to his

-natural safety position. It was

something that had to be done.
The Panthers lost starters Gary
Richard, Quintin Jones and Billy
Owens to graduation.

Needless to say, there were a
few holes to fill.

Riddick became one of those
fillers. He came into the season
as the starting strong-safety but
was injured at the end of fall
drills. After sitting out the first
game (a 59—10'Pitt victory over
Northern Iowa), Riddick came‘
back against Ohio State and has
been a starter ever since.

"lt's not been as big a change
as people think, because as a
freshman, I went through all of
camp as a defensive, back,” the
6-foot—3, 210—pound sophomore

« said. "Once you go through two

weeks of camp, constantly

repeating plays over and over -

again, you don't forget it.

"And I didn't forget it last year,
even though I played on offense.
So when I got back in the spring
and moved back to defense, it
was‘ no problem.”

Riddick played both offense
and a little defense last season. At
the start of the season, he was a

' reserve free safety and complet-

ed the season with 11 tackles,
seven unassisted. As a fullback,
Riddick finished with 175 yards
on 40 carries.

The change seems to suit him
just fine. Riddick is sixth on the
team with 42 tackles and has
recovered one fumble (against
Rutgers).

"I've improved as I've gone
along,” Riddick said. "I think the
past, maybe, two weeks, I've
graded out in the upper 90 per-
cent, and I'm starting to assert

' myself a little bit more. I'm feel-

ing more and more comfortable
as the year goes on."

Going into the season, there
was a lot of talk about how young
the defense was; Pitt (5-3) started
only three seniors. Then inj ries
started to hit the club. Marc Slpin—
dler and Richard Allen went
down with knee injuries. Burt
Grossman was sidelined for
awhile with a sprained ankle.
Troy Washington has been
bothered by a few nagging inju-
ries that have kept him at less
than 100 percent.

It could put a strain on the
team, but Riddick feels that they
have handled it well and are start-
ing to gel together.

"After the Notre Dame game,
we had lost three in a row and
were a little down," Riddick said.
"We sort of figured that we were
going to make or break our sea-
son starting with Temple.

‘ "We came together as a
defense, we shut Temple down,
we shut Navy down, and we han-
dled them pretty well. So, I think
as a unit we're playing real well.
In the secondary, we are playing
well. We need another good ef-

Theresa Pickolo (1,000
freestyle) and Karin Masal (200
breaststroke) also came out on
top in their swimming events. In
addition, Pitt's Krissa Ratliff won
the 1—meter dive, and her team-
mate, Margie Paulick, aced the
3-meter dive. Overall, Syracuse
only won three of the 15 events
on the day.

Wednesday, November 9, I988

The Syracuse victory followed
an Oct. 29 defeat of crosstown
rival Duquesne in which the
losers failed to register a single
first-place finish. Gallagher and
Kara Moxi were involved in dou-
ble victories. The former won the
50 freestyle and 100 backstroke,
while the latter dominated the
200 butterfly and was part of the
winning 400 freestyle relay.
Caroline Day, Liz Sari, Sullivan,
Tricia Rickert, Masil and Mary
Caspero were the other individu-
al winners for Pitt.

Pitt's 400 meter relay combina-
tion of Barry, Makiel, Caspero

and Janine Atiyeh likewise beat
down the opposition.

The bottom line is that even
with 18 freshmen and sopho-
mores on the squad, the Lady
Panthers are still likely to steam-

roll through the Big East. Be— '

lowich, the cautious optimist,
refused to accept the conference
championship in November but
also added that the chances are
more than likely that several
teams will be staring up at Pitt.
"1 do think we're going to be
very competitive in the Big East,"
Belowich stated recently. "We al-

Pitt's Louis Riddick (5) is sixth on the team with 42 tackles so far this season.

State]/'

Riddick's teammates agree.
They feel that the defense has
done a fine job and is just getting
better.

"We started out real well, then
we cameidown a little bit, and
now we're back up," fellow
defensive back Cornell Holloway
said. "We have come along real

well. I like the way that the"

defense is playing so far.

"I felt we could be good, but
I wasn't really positive. It just de-
pended on how some of the new
guys would do. In the spring, I
knew we had a good defense. It

just depended on how everybody
would come together.”

Because of the injuries, the
Panthers have been forced to
move to an even younger team as
they move on to the toughest part
of the '88 schedule — three
straight road games against Penn
State, North Carolina State and
Syracuse.

"|t's going to be interesting
playing on the road," Riddick
said. "We've played seven games
at home, and I think a lot of guys,
in their own way, are sort of anx-

ious to leave here and play some-

where else. We want to show

other teams’ fans that we are a
good team. We are going to try
and start that this week in Penn
State.” ‘

Riddick seems to be around the

action during every game. He

recovered the fumble against Rut-

gers last week, and later in the
game, linebacker Jerry Olsavsky

intercepted a pass and, as he was
going down, tried to give the ball
to Riddick. A
"On the fumble, the receiver
caught the ball, and Robert Brad-
ley, Cornell Holloway and myself
hit him at the same time,” Rid-

College football is a victim of its schedules

Blame it all on BYU.

Remember the year 1984? The
year the Brigham Young football
team, coached by LaVe|le Ed-
wards and quarterbacked by Rob-
bie Bosco, shocked the college
football world, not so much by
going undefeated for the season,
but by hypnotizing the Top 20
pollsters into viewing that quali-
ty of "losslessness" as grounds for
awarding them a national cham-
pionship.

First place in the so-so Western
Athletic Conference. A rugged
24-17 victory over Michigan in
Holiday Bowl VII; 13-0-0 were
the numbers the Cougars chalked
7 up that year. Undefeated. Untied.

And untested.

A patsy schedule consisting of
Pittsburgh, Baylor, Tulsa, Hawaii,
Colorado State, Wyoming, Air
Force, New Mexico, Texas El
Paso, San Diego State, Utah,
Utah State and of course, Michi-
gan, the sixth-place finisher in the
Big Ten landed the Cougars with
its first—ever national title.

And hence the trend of collegi-
ate football powers scheduling
toaster pastries has caught on
like... like toaster pastries doused
in Arco high octane.

The name of the game nowa-
days is wins, pure and simple.
Have more than six wins and
have any kind of reputation,

you've got yourself a bowl bid,
and a nice bowl of dough to go
with it.

Don't get the wrong idea about
all this. The Cougs didn't come
up with this scheduling scheme

DANYLUK

on purpose, now. They were just
going about their business, play-
ing the same competitive sched-
ule, for their level, that they play
every year in the WAC, and hop-
ing for a successful season.
Brigham Young's football pro-
gram is certainly not as mighty as,

say, Oklahoma's or Georgia's or
Southern Cal's; although some
great athletes like Jim McMahon,
Steve Young, Via Sikahema and
Todd Christensen have played
there, it's certainly not consid-

" ered to be a "factory."

And there have also been bet-
ter BYU teams than the 1984
version.

But the number of wins were
~ no, check that, the number of
losses were right, and that caught
the attention of the pollsters, who
did the dirty work.

The polls, you see, were the hit
men.

Consider the current version of
the AP top nine -— we'll exclude

No. 10 Wyoming, another WAC
team, from this survey. In order:
Notre Dame, Southern Cal, Mia-
mi, West Virginia, Florida State,
UCLA, Nebraska, Oklahoma and
Auburn.

These teams have a combined
total of 73 wins and six losses.
Nineteen of those wins, or over
25 percent, have come against
the likes of San Diego State, Long
Beach State, Bowling Green, Cal
State—Fullerton, Virginia Tech,
East Carolina, Cincinnati, Tulsa,
Utah State, UNLV,.Rice, Kansas,

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesdoy, November 9, I988

 

Lantagne helps set things up for Lady Panthers volleyball

By Chris Bosak

Staff Writer

The Pitt volleyball team is hav-
ing another great year, currently
boasting a 19-7 record. Last year,
they finished with an impressive
37-6 record.

But the next few years could be
the best in Pitt's recent history. In
the middle of this very promising
future is sophomore Jenelle
Lantagne.

Lantagne, who comes from

California, is the starting setter for I

Pitt and is still getting better -— a
pretty scary thought for oppo-

nents, considering she was the ‘

Big East Freshman of the Year last
year

”Jenel|e has a good mix of
youthful enthusiasm and ex-
perience,” said volleyball coach
Shelton Collier.

Experience as a sophomore?

Yes, and plenty of it. Perhaps the
most important experience com-
ing from the Junior Olympic pro-
gram in San Diego. The Junior
Olympic volleyball season start-
ed soon after her high school
season.

”The. Junior Olympics is a lot
more competitive than high
school,” said Lantagne. ”It was a
good intermediate step to help
with the transition from high

[school to college.”

But the experience doesn't stop
there. Lantagne is also a regular
player on the California beach
circuit during the summer.

Last summer she teamed up
with her 16-year-old sister Nicole
and won the Ocean Side Beach
Open, a prestigious outdoor
women's tournament. They also
obtained a AA ranking for beach
volleyball —— one ranking shy of
the AAA pros.

Lantagne has no preference
playing indoor or outdoor
volleyball.

”Indoor is a lot more special- ‘

ized,” said Lantagne. ”Outdoor
requires more all-around skills; it
shows your strength as a player.”

The 5—foot-7 Lantagne also
pointed out that size is not as big
a disadvantage on the beach.

But her relatively small size
hasn't hurt her too much, as she
is considered the No. I setter in
the Big East conference.

”I’d like her to set her sights
even higher," said Coach Colli-
er. ”If she works hard, she could
establish herself as one of the top

two or three setters in the eastern
half of the country.”

The setter of a volleyball team
has to run the offense. The posi-
tion is comparable to that of a
quarterback or point guard, ac-
cording to Collier. The setter gets
a lot of credit when things go

—right, and a lot of blame when

they don't.

’’I’m a lot harder on the setter,”
said Collier. ”Traditionally I yell
at the setter more, but she accepts
it and handles it well.”

Lantagne responded, ”Initial|y
it gets me mad, but it only gets
me to work harder; he only wants
me to get better. The day he stops

criticizing is the day I'll start to
wonder what's going on.”
In fact, the Pitt volleyball

coaching staff is a major reason -
Lantagne is here all the way from -

San Dieguto High School. She
wanted to play for a nationally
respected coaching staff, as .well
as get a good education at a
respected academic institution.
She also wanted to experience
city life as opposed to life in her
small beach town.

She is happy with her choice
but could use ”a few more heat
waves.”

dick said. ”The receiver was
scrambling for it, and I was on top
of him, so I just reached over and
grabbed it. Nothing too fancy.

’’I didn't even know what Jer-
ry was doing. I was coming over
to get a block for him, and the
next thing I knew, he shoved it in
my gut.

’’If I would have known that's
what he was doing, maybe I
would have had a little more time
to react and keep my feet. But I

So far this season, Riddick
hasn't tripped up too often, so
one is forgivable.

this year to pick up another gum-
drop in Northern Iowa.

Certainly no coincidence that
both Maryland and Miami have
had their way with the Panthers
in recent years, think?

The Sun Bowl recently an-
nounced that it was considering
Pitt as a candidate for its Christ-
mas Ev,e game, probably because
of the Panthers’ 5-3 record. Let's
see, those five wins were over, let
me check, Northern Iowa, Rut-
gers, Navy, Ohio State and peren-
nial powerhouse Temple. And
they lost to Boston College, Notre
Dame and WVU. What a dev-
astating force those Panthers
much be, what a fantastic Christ-
mas Eve alternative to opening
presents and Johnny Mathis yule
albums.

Johnny Majors, head coach
and scheduling advisor at the
University of Tennessee, is doing
himself in at the school. Along
with putting a lousy team on the
field, the 2-6 (including a win

over Memphis State) Volunteers ’

have been faced with a pretty
tough slate of opponents in the
SEC, along with improved
Washington State and Duke.

So watch the likes of Youngs-

State start popping up on future
Tennessee schedules, whether

while longer.

”One thing I can assure you
guys is that I'm not retiring,” he
said.

”A guy who doesn't have it any
more couldn't have beaten Don-
ny LaIonde.”

Of course, that assurance from
the fighter who has retired three
times is not a guarantee he will
fight again.

”Right now I just want go
home and relax and watch the
tape of the fight and evaluate my-
self,” Leonard, 32, said at a news
conference the morning after he
knocked down Lalonde twice
and stopped him in the ninth
round.

tagne has been hot on the court
this year.

She was named to two All-
Tournament teams this year: the
West Virginia Classic and the
Penn State Classic.

Lantagne would like to con-
tinue playing after college but ad-
mits the options are slim.

"Volleyball is so much a part
of my life now,” said Lantagne.
’’I really want to be involved af-
ter school, perhaps [in]
coaching.” ,

Lantagne has already been in-
volved with volleyball for about

nine years. Her parents got her
and her sister interested in the
game at a young age by taking
them to pro—beat beach tourna-
ments around their home.

Now, Lantagne enjoys going
home for Christmas, teaming up
with her sister and challenging
her parents to some two-on—two
outdoor volleyball.
