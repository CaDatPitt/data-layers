Engineers to Celebrate
Coming, of Saint atrick

Within a month, students will be confronted with _a

conglomeration of ’aerials, spark ' plugs, miniature atomic
plants and shillelaghs and shamrocks. Engineers’ Week will

begin March 12.

Beginning Monday, and continuing through to the ﬁnal‘

dance, Engineers will carry out the 1956 theme, “The Role
of the Engineerin the Modern World.”

Reigning as outstanding per-9
sonality of the program’ will be’
St. Patrick, who will occupy a’

"seat ' among" celebrities from‘ the
political, entertainment, military,
and industrial ﬁelds. - -
He was selected as the en-
gineers’ patron saint because he
drove the snakes out of Ireland,
thus instituting. the ﬁrst worm
drive. - ' ' ‘ ‘
In accordance with the pres-
ence of St-. Pat, and in keeping
with the precedent of purchasing

’ threesquare feet of land in Ire-' -'

land, students will see a replica
of A the Blarney Stone, shamrocks
transported from Ireland and
shillelaghs presented to digni-U
tar.ies. ' , ." ~

The idea behind Engineers’
Week began in 1903 when ‘a group
of imaginative students at the
University of .Missouri decided
that a loose translation of the
doctrine of “Erin - Go -Bragh”
could be ‘St. Patrick was an en-
gineer”. '

In 1954 Pitt adopted -the pro-
gram honoring\ engineers of the
University. Since its original
admiion in 1903, “Erin Go Bragh”
has become‘ accepted as the uni-
versal byword of engineering
students.

The program is being headed
by engineering chairman Tom
Taroli, Chairmen of various pro-
jects are: John I-leidler, Chem. ’57
—-Chapel; Mitchell‘ Kozikowski,

“Reds Study Vaccine ProjeCtS

Russian Scientists
Describe Factory

By LEONARD KIRSCH
Although the Soviet Union
has only about one tenth as
many polio cases as the United
States, a delegation of four
Russian scientists visiting

...-:’“la€re showed great interest in

the work being done by Dr.
Jonas Salk. ‘ . -

Thevisitors, all from the Rus-
sian Academy of Medical Sci-
ences, gave Dr. Salk complete
credit for the development of an
effective polio’ vaccine and are
considering the ‘establishment of
a similariinnoculation program in
the Soviet Union.

Dr. Mikhail P. Chumakov, Di-
rector of the Poliomyelitis Re-
search Institute~»of Soviet Russia,
acting as spokesman for the group‘,
said that the hospitality and co-
operation of both the American
scientists and the U.S. Govern-

_ment was highly rewarding. The

- group was permitted to see all

that it hoped and had time to
gee and there were no security

“regulations that interfered with

‘.

their work, according to ‘Dr.
Chumakov.
.In "response to the question,
“Are their any medical develop-
ments in the Soviet Union that
might, be of interest to a group
of American doctors?”, Dr.
Chumakov listed Soviet achieve-
ments in medicine that included
an effective inﬂuenza vaccine. It
is a living virus vaccine, which
may .be sniffed into the nose.
Since .1950 -the vaccine has been
administered to about 10,000,00=0
"people a year. The doctor added
"that this and all other Soviet
medical deevlopments have been
published so that all scientists
can make ‘use of them.
The Russians were also very
proud of their programs of ma-
ernal and child care and the

greatly reduced infant mortality
rates and the education and em-
ployment of the handicapped
includes a factory in Leningrad

which is completely_ manned by

Chumakov.

He also said that-state policy
would permit a group of Ameri-

developments’ in the U.S.S.R.
which might" (‘be of interest "to
them. In this way herhoped that

information could be set up be-

vAn opportunity to brush up on
their reading ability without mov-
ing from their favorite television
‘chairs is offered Pittsburghers by
a’ Pitt professor who conducts his
class over WQED_ on Thursday
‘evenings. ‘ A

Purpose of the course, “Improve
Your Reading,” is to increase the

,, -ability toread and to understand

¥
7.4.-._

. by sharpening the visual skills and
increasing the speed of perception.
Conducting the weekly class for
ﬁreside students will be Dr. Don-
ald L. Cleland, professor of edu-
cation and director‘ of_the Uni-
versity’s reading laboratory.

Dr. Cleland is a. veteran at
helping adults, improve their
ability to read, -having con-
ducted a course at ’Westing-
house, Koppers, Armco Steel,
Armstrong Cork and other in-

' dustrial firms, in addition to his

,work as teacher and director of

Pitt’s reading laboratory.

Similar classes have been part

, of the regular Pitt curriculumffor
seven years and they are always
filled, according to Dr. Cleland.
Reading, he adds, is a skill which
can be improved with practice,
just" as skill can be increased in
more active pursuits.

One of the features of this
course is that those who partici-
pate in it will be able to deter-
mine how 'much progress they
made during the 15 weeks of
training. Tests were administered
by the University, before and will
be given after the course, to de-
termine how much the participant
increased his reading skill.

The initial test was given at
the Cathedral of Learning at
7:30 pan. on Feb. 3. The date of
the second test will be announc-
ed‘ later. *

In the past four eyars, frosh
women have worn armbands, so
they could be recognized by up-

Once in a while a program as good as “Help” Week -is -
developed which endears the college fraternity man or A

soroity woman to the local community.

But, all too often, careless planning has crushed some of
the best thinking, creating a “snafu” neither. commendable
to the University nor to individual Greek groups rushing
new students. Such was the case_.with the second “Help”
Week heldlast week. ' J ' A ‘

YMCA‘ Community Service chairman Tony. Traﬁcante
and his committee palnned too little and too late despite

that this year was the ﬁrst time sororities offered to join '

fraternities in the project. Six of the seventeen sororities (at
least a beginning) offered to render services of actives .an'd'.

pledges to improve physical conditions in community service" '

agencies.

Traﬁcante told concerned representatives that he would
Contact them soon. No one received any word concerning
arrangements up to the ﬁrst day of the semester break. Then
he went _into action and sent letters" to the sorority houses--_
some of which are clos.ed during vacation, and others, rela-
tively unoccupied.

The results-—one sorority showed up ‘Feb. 7 and Traﬁ-
cante mourned to\newspaper people, “They all agreed and.
they all had-letters telling them where and when to go. Then
they don’t show up.” What a blot on fully worthwhile

_ intentions!

After the letters were mailed, Traﬁcante called one sor-
ority with the correct information. But the others suffered

' through poor planning. But for that we cannot entirely‘

blame Mr. Traﬁcante.

Because Pan—Hellenic Council did not vote full support"

2 to “Help” ‘Week, the few sororities that joined the program

were, from the start, disorganized. Why every sorority didn’t
join is beyond us. But Pan-Hel’s failure to meet responsibility
made it necessary for Traﬁcante to contact groups at random,
instead of through regular Pan-Hel channels. ..

There is one more consideration. If Traﬁcante was un-
able to contact the women properly? why did involved sor-
orities wait until “Help” Week to ﬁndout what their re-
sponsibilities were to be‘? Both his ‘address and phone num-
ber are listed in the student directory. V D‘

Army Bounced, 7-67,
For Only Eastern Win

By STEVE BUTCHOCK.
Coach Bob Timmons’ cagers embarked on their inter-
semester Eastern tour with high hopes of increasing their

10-6 slate.

There was even a possibility, though remote, that they
would receive ‘a post-season bid to a tournament, if they
could manhandle Syracuse, Colgate, Navy, and Army.

The best that they could do, however, was salvage a

their fourth straight setback as
they held a 38-32 lead. ,
Things remained’ dark for the
Blue ‘and’ Gold passers until
‘midway through the second half
[when they suddenly found the
range and outscored the opposi-
tion 20 points to ﬁve.
The eleventh-hour spurt assu_red

‘the victory and put the season's

FAM(lUS LAW CASES: NO. 1-—.GRANSMlRE  

vs. MIDDLE ATLANTIC; BUS AND DRAY CO.

Gransmire, the plaintiff in this celebrated case, lived with his
daughter Ernest and a canary named Whirlaway on Elm Street ‘
in Cooch‘; Delaware. The Middle Atlantic Bus and Dray Co, “
started operating a bus line on Elm Street. The passing buses
caused a cut-glass‘ chandelier in the Gransmires’ living room_ 
to begin tinkling. The chandelier tinkled in the key of _E-ﬂgt. .: .. 

sharp, that the poor bird moulted out of season, caught a,« chill,.

and died untimely.

Ernest, Gransmire’s daughter, was herself so_ unsettled by. 77'.‘-T "C"-3'
the death of the canary that she flunked her ﬁnal exams at the 
Boar-’s, Head Beauty and Barber College, where shephad been a  _

~\ .,.

'promising student, majoring in bangs. Now removed, willy-I -
nilly, from the skilled labor market, Ernest found work carry-" _ .
_ ing a sandwich sign for the old Vienna. Chow Mein parlor.

 

Here she met a bus—boy named Crunch Sigafoos. Although ..
. M Crunch was not especially attractive - he had, for one thing, 3.4

large bushy tail — he was always clean and neat and kept his

shoes shined, and after a decent interval, he and Ernest were

married.

5;, 3 .

This so unnerved the canary,-Whirlaway, whose key was C’.-T

(

Ernest soon learned that Crunch’s'large bushy tail was not i 
as anomalous as she had supposed: Crunch was a_ werewol .

” ' After a while Ernest got sick of staying home at night while

her husband went prowling about, so she asked him to change
her into a werewolf too, which he did with an ancient Transyl-
vanian incantation. Then, together, the two of them would '.
lope out each night and meet a lot of other werewolves and .1.-

maybe kill a few’ chickens or hear’ some book re
lay around and shoot theibreeze;

Meanwhile, Ernest and Crunch’s landlady, a miser named
Mrs. Augeiiblick, noticed that Ernest and'Crunch never used
their room at night, so she, in her greed, started renting it to V '
transients. One‘ nighta Mr. Ffolliett stayedthere. In the morn-

ing while brushing his hair, he took a bottle that looked like ,

hair tonic out. of the cabinet, ‘poured some, -and rubbed it
vigorously into his scalp. Unfortunately,‘ it was not hair tonic, .,
buta bottle of glue which Ernest had bought to mend _a model _.

her for their paper wedding ‘

As a result. of Mr. Ffolliett’s grisly error, he was unable
to remove_his hat and was, therefore, barredgfrom his usual
occupation which was lecturing to women’s clubs. He sued Mrs.
Augenblick, who sued Ernest, who went to her father, who sued

the Middle AtlanticBus and Dray Co. who had started the whole’ ; L.

horrid chain of events. 5

“Ladies and gentlemen,-” said the defense attorney in his
opening address, “this case, though ‘very ramiﬁed, is covered
by law. Indeed, every facet of life is covered by law. Law
governs the homes you live in, the cars you drive, the food you
eat. Even the cigarette you smoke is strictly regulated. The
gentleness, however, is Philip Morris’s own idea. Out. of their
vast experience as tobacco people, out of theirprofound regard -"
for the astuteness of your palate, the makers of Philip Morris
have evolved a gentle, new cigarette, with ‘a ‘taste as mild as a
May‘ morn, as subtle as gossamer, as welcome as money from

home. I thank you."

Whereupon everybody rushed to the tobacco counter to buy
bright red, white and gold packs of Philip Morris and were all
rendered so amiable after a few gentle puffs, that the whole

complicated case was dropped. This-later became

The revenue stamps are similar
to those found on packages of

Before China enforced Commu-

‘communication with the country.
Now he obtains the stamps via
Hong. Kong, still undisturbed by
Communists. .

Through stamp collectors’ jour-

Sorority/lid Confused
By Traficante Mailing

By AL DONALSON '

Pitt’s 1956 Community Service Help Week proved partly
“successful” although there was some “misunderstanding”
concerning the participation of the sororities during the week.

Tony Traﬁcante, chairman of the Help Week program,

stated last week that the fraternities ‘made a “ﬁne showing.

whichtenabled the week to be a success,” but he admitted
that there was a “gross misunderstanding and mixup in com-

munication” between him and the¢

¢

sororities.

Letters with directions for the
ﬁve participating sororities were
sent to the individual sogority
houses during the week of ﬁnal
exams, but according to -Shirley
Backstrom, president of Pan-Hel-
lenic, most of the sorority presi-
dents live at their homes.

“Also, most of the "girls aren't
around their houses during ﬁnal
exams. Tony should have sent the
directions much earlier than he
did. We asked him several times
for our instructions, but he kept
putting us off,” Miss Backstom
said. _

Five Groups To Have Worked

Five sororities were to have
joined pledges of ﬁve fraternities‘

‘ to clean windows, washwalls, and

paint ﬂoors at various public in-
stitutions around Pittsburgh, but
only one sorority, Delta- Delta
Delta showed up. .

A daily newspaper ampliﬁed
this fact, and quite a few of the
sorority leaders are dissatisﬁed
with the manner the daily
handled the situation. The daily
published a prominent story on
the ﬁrst page of its second’sec-
tion which put the sororities in
a “bad light.” According to Miss
Backstrom, the result has been
“frightening.” '

“‘My home phone islringing all
the time with people and alumnae

who want to know why the soror-
ities didn’t show up. The incident
will probably kill our rushing be-
cause it will be a perfect excuse
for some parents to persuade their
daughters not to join a sorority,”
Miss Backstrom said. 1
Agencies Not Prepared ,
However, Traﬁcante
thta he was rather glad that the
sororities didn’t show up because
some of the agencies weren’t ex-
pecting them and didn’t have any
equipment for them to.u'tilize. ‘
“The letters I sent the soror-
ities stated that if they were,
planning to co—operate, they"
would be expected to notify the
agencies they uvere to serve.
Since the sororities never re-'
ceived any letters, the agencies
were never notiﬁed,” Traﬁcante.
explained. ’ .

The Help Week program was

instituted last year by Interfra-
ternity Council and YMCA as a

duplicates speeds as high as Mach 2.73. To re-
produce such prodigious ﬂight conditions, ex-
traordinary equipment had to be devised. For
example, a 21,500-hp driving dynamometer sup-
plies the» enormous power needed to test jet
engine compressors over a range of speeds from

800 rpm to 16,000 rpm.
