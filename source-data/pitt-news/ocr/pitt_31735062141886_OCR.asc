_ The card party given at Kaufma‘i1n’s
on Saturday, December 30, has been
voted generally the most successful
social affair,-ex_ceptin'g only the Sun-
set dinners,.that the aluninae has ever_
staged. There were two hundred and
forty,-five playing" during the.Vafter-
noon. In addition, just to be so‘cia_b|e,
‘many. girls who do not play cards,
dropped in during the aftern_o'oi"1’ to
say hello to everybody. So far money
has been received for about seventy-
fi_ve tickets that were not used.
' The following are some of .-the girls
who had tab1es:' Mary Aiken, '19;
Sara ‘Leonard Allison, ’21; Mary
Bechtel, "19;' Louise Culley, '16;
Helen Donaldson, '16; Genevieve Ed-
wards, ’21; Ruth Fleming, '19; Har-

"Clare Griﬂin’ Schweinberg, ’14, an

Among the out-of-town“ alumnae
'who'"had' tickets but were unable to
attend were: Dr. Elizabeth Leiper
Martin, ’02, who_is at the Friends-Hos
pital in Philadelphia, and ‘Stella Duff.
Guter, ”14, who lives in Newark, New
Jersey. ." ‘ ‘ .

 

Clare Griﬂin Schweinberg, 714,
whose home is in Gary, Indiana, ap-
preciated having the party during the
hnl-idays for it seems she is always,
zba.-c_-k in Pittsburgh ‘"just in time to
miss an ‘affair and that this time her
luck changed. Sorry her youngsters
“could not have" come to the party
also! -’ " . -

vided the entertainment of theafter-l
noon by giving several" solo -dances.
Alpha Burkart, '17, home for the
holidays .,from Columbia, reported a

7, The same crowd of “Old Faithfuls”
is depended upon largely
every affair through, but the number"
is increasing and additions always
welcome and most encouraging: Eva

-of .the bureau, because" of their pecu-.

placed but every effort is being made
to provide for their interests.
-alumni are employed at the present

time. and stated that more lucrative _

positions than the ones which . they

them. It is this kind of service which
the burea"u is attempting to give, Mr.
Mallory _ announced," again emphasiz-
ing "that "“Pitt service for ~Pitt men?’
includes the development of opportu-
nities for theemployed as well as for
the ‘jobless. ‘ ' . _

“What we are trying to do,” the -.su_-
pervisor stated, “is to give to all Pitt

men, ..present, and. past, the very best. ‘

service possible. "Not only are we go-
ing after alumni to permit us to help
them secure better "positions, but we
are also making alumni who‘are em-

ment problems for them. Many alum-
"ni -have risen in the ‘business world
and frequently need men possessing
certain _q"ualiﬁcations., Our bureau is
in a position to‘ take care of their
needs and we are inviting them to
take advantage of our service. If
Pitt me. ,.;._,need work and other Pitt
men nee "workers, I believe thatthe

its powerto bring the ‘members of
these two groups.together.” V

' . Since the major work of the bureau,
Mr." Mallory stated, concerns the
placement of self-supporting students
in positions. of .a _par_t-time icharacter

to enable them to continue their "stu,d- .

ies, local alumni are urged to get in

present to hear it... A slight pause
and then the second bell. ~ The roll was
called. Twelve students answered
“here.” A-‘careful count would have
revealed 11 'students,presen-t. ,

The “Prof” didn’t. notice this, yet
he was mad, vexed,- angered and sore.
He bawled out those present for the
sins of those who were absent, whom
he rightly expected would come strag-

were opened. The irate.ped‘agogue be- ‘

the. door failed to open._ The class
gathered around the exit. ’In turn the

la'r work at“ the; indoor itrackf under

the ’tutela'ge__ of Coach Frank ‘Shea. .-

There will be _a - few‘ indoor’ meets
-from, time totime and most of the
‘team's work will have to be done. in-

doors in preparation for the early -

spring’ meets, it always_ being uncer-

tain _whether the team will get out- .
. doors before‘ the first meet.

. iAn.attract'ive schedule is -being‘ ar-
ranged by’ Student ‘ Manager ~ Har-

baugh Miller and has beencompleted-i
with the exception of _on'e_date _.and --
should be ready for announcement]

next Week. . g .,
Prospects’, are for a-
paboutas good as last" year's, which
means that there is room for bolster-
ing in several events. The sprints
especia,1ly'areé ‘weak and it would cer-
tainly be a. boon to “the team’s
chances it a star sprinter could be
foundofrom the rank and ﬁle-ofmthe
student —-body. Several X'_other_. events
-are none too’ well taken care of, and
for this reason both Director Miller
and Coach Shea.‘ are anxiousto see
the largest turnout j of ' ‘candidates

that has ever reported‘ heretof_ore. -.for N

track. ’  . _  .
' A large number , of- candidates
would‘ practically" insure the -success
of the track season, for-it has al-
ways been the history of the larger
‘un-iversitiesl that the‘,more men“ out
for the track ‘team. the greater. that
~tea1_n'.’ ‘It is pointed out that half;-of
the 'University re-cord holders never
had track experience before they “en-

tered the University and for this "rhea-,[ "

son’ there are undoubtedly a number
of'promising men in the“ 1 student
body who. have never given them-'
selves 2. chance to see what they
could do. These are themen whom
Coalchv Shea is /especially anxious to
see now. ‘  "   A

from.10.:,0O to 12:00 on Monday,’

“KNOW THYSELF”‘

There is oftentimes such a thing as
toomuch of ‘a good thing. ,_Because~a
principle or an idea is workable and
effectiveto ascertain extentis no rea-

son ._whY it i..c._ou_1d. be ’aDD1ied..‘a;nr!;‘?3?<*- Q
tended indeﬁnitely and‘ _‘still be _‘e'ffe‘c'-_

tive. -,In_ fact there are always other

limiting factors to be taken into ac- .

count, which must" be present vin or-'

derpfor}, the ﬁrst to be useful. '_
The craze ‘of modern‘ times -is high-

Standards in protes-

stantly being exacted. _Wl1ile not
many years ago a man could become
a lawyer or a doctor or a teacher
without ‘much ‘preliminary training,
he must now undergo yearsof prep-
aration before he can enter upon his
p.i'o_fession.l ‘Colleges of law, medi-
cine, teachers’ "colleges, and all such
training schools are now ﬁlledgto
overflowing. 4 ' . _ A W.

.. In all this craze of preparation there
is the growing da-nger that the cen-

tral purpose of the whole system will .

be overlooked.- Many, students go
away from the‘ training which "they
have -received, with the H‘ necessary
number of hours but with littleelse.
Wltll many the requirement comes to
mean only" an, artiﬁcial standard
which one can meet by spendingthe
needed time and money. -Lots of
prospective teachers attend; colleges
of education, take the required
amount of educational work, and be-
gin their professional.-career ﬁtted ac-

cordingto the law to fulﬁll their due '

ties thought by capacity ‘they may
not beﬁtted at all.  A ‘W *  ’
Too much; emphasis is placed’ on

training which becomes oftentimes. -'

onlya shadow.‘ After all the purpose
_of ‘training is not’, so much to educate
one as ‘to educate" him to educate
‘himselfg The thing ‘to be borne’ in
mind during the whole process is"‘the
importance of self-education.’ -The
wide-spread criticisms ':of the present’
day college education come fromthe
fact‘ that students are-not taught to
t-hink.for themselves. ‘ 1 '  
It would be worth while in this ,"con.-"
nection _to study the education of such
men as Benjamin Franklin and Abra-
ham Lincoln who were able, to learn
without an instructor, who depended.
only on books and nature for their
knowledge. Benjamin ._ Fra_nk_lin_’s, 7',d_,e-.
scription in his 7 Auto.biogra.phy, -or
N practiced‘ his ..p,ow‘e_r‘ 01:‘.
thought ‘is very interesting. By de-
pending simply on “himself, . reading

carefully and o observing 1 closely :_he' '

built‘ up a mind and a personality that

._were unsurpassed in his generation-.

Without anything‘ else t_l'1an‘- the "light"
of_ the hearth and an open bookpand
an intent mind, Abraham Lincoln pre-
pared himself in :,the',lonely.o,lo'g cabin‘
for the solemn “responsibilities, that
were _..to, be cast on his shoulders :;}a.l'_._Bl"'

me what I did draw or’ write and -1.
said Oh I _can do“=both.‘ ‘She said if.
I put my picture in the paper it would
-be a pretty good laugh and I says yes’
and if you weren’t seen walking down
these ‘halls the students would _-have
to lookfor something to laugh at.
and -I guess that stopped her. I_ says
to the editor of the magazine that I
knew of several _ways to improve his

 

 

. stuff-'a_nd he says that was ﬁne that

*‘RAZZ,lNG“” 5As .2-AISPORT

if there is one thing'thait distin-
guishes the college man from’ others,
it is hisability to‘ take ‘a good “razz-
ing” from him but a reply -and _a kind
of. or. recital of "his faults will elicit
nothing from him but .a.reply- in a
kind-of a «laugh... ' I ‘ ‘ _

Anyonewho has spent several years
around college knows the tendency’ of.
the students to frankness’ in pointing,
out faults; though it is always done’
in an inoffensive‘ way.‘ Yet, there .,is
much real good accomp_l,is'hed by the
talks ‘in which-. a man is- “razzed” by
everyone .present. ’ _ -2
gs Generally‘ the ‘one undergoing the
ordeal,._if it can be called such, takes‘
-it good-na_tur'edl_y and thinks“ little of

gray matter to think of a ‘‘comeback’’‘
that willfbe hot enough to‘ turn the
tide of criticism; from him to his ad-
versary._ ~_ . _- C  

But after heghas gone to his room
he begins to think, and wonders" if
there is ‘truth in the statements. that

_ing” ._him downstairs. , Little by little

rect those faults, And; he does, for
he knows that they will -be— har.p'e_d
upon by his‘ friends until he shows:
improvement. ' i - A ' .

Many faults which are fast devel-
oping into characteristics and enter.-.
ing _into his personality, are in this;
way corrected. If the m‘an.had been
taken. to Ttask individually for these
shortcomings-and given a serious_talk,
in nine out of ten."cases hewould
have resented the'_'suggestion_s" and
have made no ‘effort whatsoever to
turn over a new leaf.  * ‘ . ‘

"This general fault-ﬁnding, ,tl1cugh'
carried to extremes in these informal
talks around’ ‘the , ﬁreplace, is often’
productive of good results, and many
a successful ‘colle'ge"ma.n will attrib-
ute much of his success -to the fact
that his weak ‘points were solunmerf
cifully pointed out to him timelafter
tiniethat henaturally-.tl1.reW them off
and thus escaped the handicap which
they would? -have given ‘him.—»State

.. THE »MlDN_lGHTl HOUR

Midnight sessions are among the
most. enjoyable. experiences in col-
lege" life. {No class room discussion
can possibly takethe place of the"
friendly, rambling, lsoul-revealing psor-t
of argument that most of us carry in“
our memories as the choicestpart of
our undergraduate days. Count not
that time lost which is stolenifrom.
studies and dull, proﬁtable education
to drag discussion throughintermin-_.,
able windings while the room is ﬁlled
with the atmosphere of philosophy
and tobacco smoke, and the hands of

seven,‘ slowly move around to four
’o’clock in the morning. -. . _
That is the time when friendshipfis
tested and tempered, when toleration
and fair-mindedness‘ are taxed to the
limit, when Utopian schemes are ad-
vanced to reform religion, college po-
litics, or the social system. That is
the time‘ when generous or impractic-
able impulses have full sway when
manvmeets ‘man without the deceiving
mask of manner and custom, on 3. ba-
sis of complete acceptance and equal-
ity] That is the time whena 1nan‘for-
gets that he has always coiisidered it
immodest to eiipose his own feelings
and beliefs‘, and when he speaks the
thoughts that are in '.his_mind with
full assurance of understanding. That‘
is the "time when friends are ‘made
whom we mean to keep through life.
-Finally, the conversation lags and
dulls, and the host shows by nods and
yawns that he is sleepy, and he opens
the door to-say “Good night,” ,w_ith_a,

time would.‘ arouse resentment. One

Some time ago God attempted to
mold into. certain of his creatures a
saving sense of humor. ‘ But. out of
the majority of the dies stepped a hid-
eous human species that has been a
curse to society since genesis-—and
the Smart Aleck was bo_rn.

His only mental reaction’ one ’ of
ridicule, he l‘ias_stood on gthe -side-
lines’ of ‘h"isto7ry~"f'or ages. Va" bane‘ to
"civilization. His existence "is not con-
structive. He does nothing but de-
stroy, and progress cannot exist where
the ' Smart .Ale'ckA rules. Nor is be
consistent, — exce_'pt_. in laughing at
everything with which he has not
_the mentality to be patient, and he
victirnizes the past as well as pro-
gress. ‘ ‘ ' I i .

Having neither a ‘judgment ofes—
sential facts, nor a sense of proprie-
-ty he recognizes and is conscious of
no moments but those of his own
devastating egoism. Atany tinlie, and
place that his mind calls upon him‘ to
_make ‘a.-fool -' of himself and to hu-
miliateothersjhe “does so, for" he is

There‘ might be some justification
for the Smart Aleck if his laugh was
an intelligent one. It is "not," for‘he
is unconsciously ‘following the tradi-
tions. of dead ages-. of Smart Alecks

because he sees the ﬂaws or they in-
congruities of the things at -which he

U Track Captain

 

'Esler Hays was elected captain of

- the track team for next. spring at a

meeting held Friday afternoon by the
Varsity Club. The election of Hays was
decided by tossing a coin in the pres-
ence of Coach Frank Shea and Man-
ager- Harbaugh -Miller. The toss-up
was decided upon to settle a tie which

resulted‘ from the election held last _
fall when Hays and Robusch each re-

ceived: an equal number‘ of votes. Ro-
busch had been announced as captain

after this’ election last fall, but it was 7

due to some error.

“Ec” Hays graduated from Taren-
tum High School, and the following
Fall entered the University of Pitts-
burgh. He had not done any running
at all in "High School,’ or even his
Freshman year at Pitt, but in his
second year as a student, he donned
the track togs. He worked cons_cien—
tiously, and made a good‘ showing that
season, and the following Spring he
made his best showing. on the cinder
path by making a new record for the
University Mile Run of-4:25 minutes.
Most of the credit of his ﬁne work-is
due to the determination of Hays him-
self, and the ‘fine coaching of Andy
Kerr. Many followers of the track.

sport were amazed when Hays de- ,_

feated Curtis of the Navy,‘ and Sim-
monds of Syracuse in the distance
runs. ' ’ V A
This -is Hays’ third year as a Var-
sity runner, and he will-make a ﬁne
Captain 1 /as the other runners have
conﬁdence in him, and he is a com-
petent leader. “Ec” is a member of

the Kappa Sigma fraternity, and this‘ .

is his ﬁrst year in law’ school.
This is one of the examples of run-

ners being developed,’ and not_ being:
born, and it is a good thing for-the

young felows who are in school now
to ‘try: out for track if they are in‘-
terested in -the sport, as they too
might be able to break the University
records some day. ' 1

On February 24, the Panther Track
team will go to J oh_ns.-Hopkins indoor
meet, where Hays is invited to a spe-
cial ‘mile run. ‘

The Pitt football team played its’

the Syria Mosque. Unlike football,-.-'=--*
banquets of previous years, this one-... 
will be open to all students and a'lu_mniV.: 
of the University. For that reason;-».
Syria Mosque has been obtained, as.-
it is the only place capable of accom-
modatingg the great number that have~ _ .
purchased tickets for tonight’s ban‘-1 _ ‘ »
quet. '  ' g _ ’ _.
Each man who has earned his let- I 5

elect a captain for next season. Who--_ 
will receive letters andwho will.-b,e_~;. 4‘ V _

any person until tonight. -,  ‘
Speeches will be few, but those that

will speak will come through with:
‘good, snappy talks, Captain “T»om-
my” Holleran will deliver his usually‘
interestincg speech. “Chuch” Bowser,.
who ‘acted as captain all season on-.~
account of Hol1eran’s injury, has;
probably . revared a-speech, for he is‘:~7T

-of course, no football banquet ‘is ever‘

Tonight will be the last opportunity

for ‘the loya1gPittites to express their",

Williams, John -Clark, Dick Simpson,‘
“Tiny” Hewitt, John Anderson, Char-

ley Winterburn, “Tiny” Miller, and ' V
Mike Hartnett will never play again '

and the «bestmeans -of showing this;
appreciation is by attending the ban-

quet tonight. “
