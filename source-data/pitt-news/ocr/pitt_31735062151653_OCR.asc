First Of 140 Carloads Comes
For Cathedral Interior;
80 Men Start Work

 

 

By The Commons Man

Towering more than 50 feet
above the Cathedral's ground
ﬂoor, a mass of steel construc-
tion which looks much like some-
thing you might have built with
your old erector set is ready for
20 stone setters when interior
construction work begins in the
Commons Room tomorrow.

Age-old limestone which, ’perhaps,‘a
glacier pushed down to Bedford, In-
diana, millions of years ago will be-
gin rolling in tomorrow. The ﬁrst car
comes in from Bedford, :and there
will be ‘a car a day in transit from
then on for some time.

When the shipment is complete, a
total of 4500 tons ‘Of the rock will
have been sent out of Bedford, put-
ting that rising little metropolis in
something of a hole. During that time

the limestone will have ﬁlled approxi-.

inately .140 railroad cars.
Employment Stepped 7.Up

Wlicii all this stone rolls into Pitts-
burgii, it will g~_'c.tl1e1* no moss, accord-
ing to ini'or::iation released by A.
A. Klimciteek, University architect.
Inimediatel_\-' upon its arrival, 80 ad-
ditional men will‘ be employed to be-
gin work on it, 20 stone setters and
60 laborers and helpers. Already
wo1‘l;in_<.: on the Commons Room in-
terior are 33 m:n—12 tinsmiths, 6
plumbers, and 15 electricians.

When the roll of states is called
for ‘contributions to the .room’s in-
terior ‘decoration, Vermont will have
a chance to step rip;ht up beside In-
diana. For vshile the roof, arches and
wails hail from the bedrock of the
Midwest, the solidly Landon state of
Vermont will provide a solid ﬂoor of
green slate.

Cement Adds Freightage

But whet.‘-.101‘ you're .a civil engineer
or not, and if you aren’t, you prob-
ably l1arci1’t read this far, you must
realize that stone just doesn’t stick

together all by itself. Cement, sand,‘
and all the. trimmings will add hun—e
dreds of tons to the freightage, not!
counting 35 carioads of ribs to sup-'
port the vaults. It’s beginning to look
like the construction -of the Commons
Room is a real engineering and archi-
tectural feat all by itself. Two lime-
stone mills in Indiana will be working
full time all this fall and winter to
load the stone.

Around the Commons Room will be
located three galleries containing 54
classrooms which will memorialize the
cultural heritages of Pittsburgh. The
17 rooms on the ﬁrst ﬂoor will con-
tain the nationality groups. On the
second ﬂoor the history of Western
Pennsylvania will be portrayed, and
the third ﬂoor classrooms will be
made into memorials to individuals
who have made great contributions
to the growth of Pittsburgh.

Worms, misquoting a proverb, al-
ways turn. University coeds could
could hardly be called worms, but they
will turn into males (worms) Wednes-
day night, October 7, for the annual
Coed Prom sponsored by WAA at the
University Club.

Not only must each girl have a date"
with an upperclasswoman, but each
escort must be invited by a senior
mentor. The mentors are date bu-
reaus for the time being. The pseudo-
Ilales will be attired in their broth-
’ or best boy friends’ summer

es for the occasion.

Iluﬂy summer dormals will be
proper attire for the freshmen.

Annual Lantern Night Heads

Welcoming Ceremonies
For Class Of 1940

Freshman women tonight will be

women at the University. The Lan-
tern Night ceremony, sponsored by
the WSGA, is the ﬁrst of a series of
Wednesday night events scheduled
for freshmen by the various women's
activities.

One of the most impressive and
oldest of the traditional ceremonies,
tonight's affair, depicts the entrance
of women into life at the University,
and is WSGA’s welcome to the fresh-
men.

Pageant Begins Early

Preceding the ceremony, the senior
mentors and their groups will dine
together at the University cafeteria at
5:30 o’clock this evening. At 7:15
o’clock, mentors and freshmen will
gather on the green between State
and Thaw Halls for the ritual.

At 7:30 o’clock, the pageant will
begin. The only lights to be used
during the play will be focused -on
the lawn bank which will serve as .a
natural setting for the players.

Participants in the ritual are: Lucy
Conn, C38, Prologue; Marcella Ley-
ton, C37, Prometheus; Lois Follans-
bee, Ed37, Alma Mater; June Greene,
C38, and Mary Jane Patterson, C39,
Guardians of the Symbolic Lights;
Ruth Shapiro, C37, Father Pitt; Mary
Louise Dowling, Ed37, Truth; Betty

Band Promises
Action, Tricks
At First Game

Maneuvers, Music Assured
As Lockhart, Flagg Take
Charge Of Group

With Captain Kenyon P. Flag of
the military department promising
bigger and better maneuvers, and Di-
rector Lockhart assuring a bigger
brass section, the University ROTC
Band is ready to swing into its share
of action at the Ohio Wesleyan game
Saturday.

Captain Flagg, new assistant pro-
fessor of military science and tactics,
will coach the band this year. He is
a graduate of Hamilton College and
Cornell University, and saw service
with the 71st Regiment of the Coast
Guard during the war.

His comment: “The Pitt Band is
remarkable to me because of the en-
thusiasm which the men display at
drill. We look forward to our trip
to Ohio State where the reputedly
best university band of the country is
located. We expect to teach them a
few things.”

According to Captain Flagg, the
large number of applicants will make
it necessary to organize another band,
since there are many more than the
customary 120 pieces. He adds, how-
ever, that there is room for anyone
who wishes to have a tryout.

The manager of the unit, T. O.
Eichler, ’38, reports that tryouts
for the band may be arranged by con-
tacting the military department. Any
student with a reasonable amount of
talent will be admitted to the organi-
zation.

Calling Candidates

Candidates for editorial posi-
tions on the 1937 Owl are asked
to report to Stanley Rogaliner,
Room 709, Cathedral, at 3:30
o’clock today. Interest and ex-
perience in photography, copy-
reading, layout and design, and
art work are desirable qualities
for the positions, according to
Rogaliner, Owl Editor.

Mirador, the Spring Formal of Penn-
sylvania College for Women, and tri-
state fraternity events. Two vocal-
ists in addition to the 12 playing mem-
bers, Maude Schaub, a Garrick High
School and Frick Teachers ’ School
graduate, and Bob Slack, are included.

Several novelty numbers are promised
by these two.

Dancing will be held at Hotel Web-
ster Hall from 3 until 6 o’clock and
the price of admission is 25 cents.

Especially the freshman ladies are
urged to attend sans escorts, as that
is traditional at “Howdy Hops.”

New Council
To Convene

On Tuesday

Activities Of Men’s Group
To Be Under Direction
Of Four Committees

Men’s Council will hold its first
meeting of the year Tuesday, Sep-
tember 29, at 4 o’clock in Room 801,
Cathedral. The Council, through the
Student-Faculty Association, came in-
to existence last spring for the sole
purpose of governing all activities
strictly pertaining to men students of
the University.

There are, at present. four com-
mittees appointed to serve in Men’s
Council. These committees are: Cus-
toms, with Louis C. Bearer, E3_7, and
Paul Jennings, C37, co-chairmen;
Loan Fund, with John Glasser, BA38,

chairman; Constitution Committee,
headed by Charles Rodgers, C37; and
committee of Policy and Study, led by
Elmer Schriber, BA37.

Precedent To Be Set

The committee of Policy and Study
will determine what Council can do
for the coming year. This committee
will, without a doubt, be making the
most important step of Council, in
that everything they do will be es-
tablishing a precedent for future
meetings.

Council will not only determine on
what dates to hold their meetings,
which will come bi-monthly, but will
elect a new secretary to replace Rob-
ert Prince, C38, who will not return
to school this year.

According to article IV of the con-
stitution dealing with vacancies: Va-
cancies caused by resignation or dis-
missal shall be ﬁlled by that candi-
date who at the preceding general
election received the vote next high-
est to that obtained by the last duly
elected member. Since Herbert Rack-
oﬂ’, C38, was next highest to Robert
Prince, he will automatically ﬁll the
vacancy.

Meetings of the Council are ordi-
narily closed to the general student
body. However, the meetings may be
declared open upon a majority vote
of the membership present.

 

Customs Bureau Helps
New Women Find Way

 

Freshman women who are having
difficulty in ﬁnding their way about
the campus should appeal to the cus-
toms bureau, which will function dur-
ing lunch hours at Heinz House. Mem-
bers of customs committee will answer
questions and attempt to solve all
problems for the freshmen.

The committee will also give infor-
mation about the customs examina-
tions which will be given at Heinz
House on October 1 and 2, from 8:30
to 5:30 o’clock. They may be identi-
ﬁed by the small gold pins with blue,
8015, and green ribbons which they
will be wearing.

as secretaries in the Pitt News Of-
ﬁco are requested to report today

Circling up the hill, the lines of col-
ored lanterns will form a striking
procession up Alumni Hall steps to
University Drive, and along the drive
to Heinz House. At Heinz House,
the ﬁnal part of the evening’s event
will be a ritual during which all
women will pledge loyalty to the Uni-
versity and to Alma Mater.

All Wear White

All freshmen and their mentors are
requested to wear white for the cere-
mony. Before and during the ritual,
music will be furnished by the Uni-

;Division Extends

Evening Courses

Courses in real estate, sponsored by
the Pittsburgh Real Estate Board,
have been added to the curriculum of

these courses, according to Robert W.
Semenow, instructor in business law
and board counsel, who will teach the
classes.

One course will deal with present-
day real estate ﬁnancing, advertising,
zoning sub-divisions, and economics.

Druids Stage Annual
Smoker in Armory

Coaches Sutherland, Carlson To Address Freshmen At
Honorary, Affair This Evening; Cass To Give
The Famous “Casey At The Bat” '

With Druids, national sophomore honorary activities fraternity,
as the go—between, 500 freshmen have a rendezvous with activi-
ties at 8 o’clock tonight in the Logan Armory. At that time the
annual Druid Smoker gets under way.

“Freshman activity aspirations will go up in something more

everything lined up that goes
will be every activity leader on
that goes into the sublime, and

plenty of vitamins to be had,” says Leonard Levison, C39, presi-

dent.

Campus activities will be repre-
sented by their respective leaders and
individual booths. In this way fresh-
men will have the opportunity of
meeting the leaders and enrolling in
the activities. Present will be the staff
members of The Pitt News, the Pitt
Panther, the Owl, Pitt Players, De-
bating, Cap and Gown, YMCA, Glee
Club, Pitt Riﬂes, Band, Orchestra,
Pitt Business Institute, and athletics.

Dr. John B. Sutherland, varsity
football coach, will be the featured
speaker of the program. This will be
the only opportunity for freshmen to
hear Dr. Sutherland.

' Dr. Carlson Speaks

Two more University favorites are
also listed. Dr. H. C. Carlson, var-
sity basketball mentor and director of
the University Health Service, will
speak. Carl Cass, director of Pitt
Players, will offer some of his read-
ings, chief of which will be “Casey
at the Bat.”

Entertainment features will be the
Glee Club Quartet and some of the

recent Cap and Gown luminaries.
§Four pep songs, “Bold Bandelero,"
:“Blow the Man Down,” “Close Har-
imony,” and “Hail To Pitt,” will be
[their contributions. Gene Burkhart,
C36, and Russell Connolly, C36, male
and female singing stars of past Cap
and Gown shows, have promised to
repeat the hit songs of their produc-
tions. Floyd Nicklas, C39, the fresh-
man dialect sensation of Cap and
Gown’s “Out for the Count” is an-
other Smoker attraction.

Tappees To Be Named

After the program, freshmen will
mingle around the Armory Hall, going
from booth to booth. During that
time refreshments, hot dogs and pop,
will be served.

Four ﬁrst-semester sophomores are
to be tapped into Druid membership.
Petitions were returned to the Dean
of Men’s Oﬂice yesterday at noon. An
election meeting was held last eve-
ning at the Phi Gamma Delta house.
These four members will keep the
membership rolls at 20, as the four
tappees of last year’s smoker become
inactive. These are Samuel Werlin-
ich, BA38, David Grossman, C38,
Frank Souchak, E38, and Stephen
Goodale, C38.

Louis Riley, E39, social chairman,
is working on ﬁnal plans for the
Smoker. Assisting him are Albert
Kairys, BA39, refreshment head,
Harry Bash, C39, booths chairman,
and Bernard McKenna, C39, program

Monday and Thursday Freshman
Clubs will hold their ﬁrst meetings
next week at the Y club rooms on
Forbes and Bouquet Streets.

A new policy, to be introduced this
year, will allow freshmen to sign up
for a six weeks’ introductory mem-
bership. New men will thus be given
a chance to sample the club activi-
ties which range all the way from
the crack luncheons served up by the
new cook to a political talk by a
Socialist. The group will be perma-
nently organized at the end of this
period of trial membership.

William W. Mendenhall, executive
secretary of the YMCA, points out
the following objectives of the clubs:
“These groups, besides providing a
good meal at a moderate price, enable
the freshmen to meet members of the
faculty in an informal and friendly
way. It gives an opportunity for
the men to discuss interesting and
timely questions, and provides for
stimulating social contacts with the
speakers.”

Membership in the club may be se-
cured by notifying YMCA headquar-
ters, Room 801, Cathedral. Admission
yvill be based on priority of applica-

THE PITT NEWS

From as far as Oshkosh State,
which we’re rather certain is way
out in Wisconsin, to as near as that
hop, step, and juznp over to the Car-
negie Tech campus, come the 56 girls
who are transfer students at the Uni-
versity this year.

Virginia Kruegarm is the sole rep-
resentative from the aforementioned
Oshkosh State, and oddly enough,
there -is just one young lassie who
may think the Pitt Band is a bit
overdressed at Saturday’s game. The
girl in question is Louise Fisher, for-
merly of Carnegie Tech.

When all of the transfers get ac-
quainted this Thursday evening at
5:30 o'clock at a Heinz House dinner
given by the WSGA social commit-
tee, they will ﬁnd that most of their
number are from Johnstown Center,
one of the University's junior col-
leges. A few will be from the Erie
' Center.

Come From Many Schools

There are 13 students here from
Johnstown Junior College, namely,
Alice Boyer. Grace Eileen Carthew,
Evan Avis Cook, Mary Jane Crouse,
Esther Goldhaber, Mary Jane Hun-
ter, Katherine Korns, Irene Lamison,
Lucille Lonergan, Margaret Living-
ston, Laureda Osborne, Electra Pan-
agotachs, Mary Louise Shaffer, and
M. Lillian Todd. The four girls who
come from Erie Center are Eleanor
Meckley. Barbara Jean Peter, Marga-
ret Phillips, and Alice Smith.

Two girls who come from Indiana
State are Nellie Jane Ashenhart and
Mary Weidle. The middle west ac-
counts for three new students, Winona
Boyle from Western Reserve, Babette
Brande from Northwestern, and Flor-
‘lence Gillespie from the University of
,2 Michigan.

The state of Ohio is just about tops
among states from which new Univer-
sity students have come. From Ohio
State comes Margaret Enders, Doris
Grinn, Ruth Hepps, and Muriel Ros-
enblum. Two former Muskingum
students are Sara Bald and Margaret
Campbell; Phyllis Taber comes from
Dennison University. Others from
that state are Anne Fitz Patrick from
Baldwin Wallace, Sara McKil1op from
Ohio Wesleyan, and Helen Claire
Young from Oberlin.

Others from near and far include
Edith Campbell from .Cornell, Mary
Margaret McAfee from Bethany,
Elizabeth Murphy from Wheaten,
Mary Perrinn from Brenau, Mrs.
Betty J. Traxell from Hollins, and
Eileen Young from Rutherford.

Students from other schools in
Pennsylvania include three from Alle-
gheny: Betty Brooke, Margaret
Sprecher, and Betty Seibert. From
Westminster come Jean Drummond,
Virginia Morrison, and Mary Lois
Timlin. Three who travel just a bit
farther on the street car are Hilda
Brown, Julia George, and Claire Weil
who are from PCW.

Three who come from Penn State
are Camille Knoth, Marion Sebicoff,
and Harriet Wolfe. Charlotte Wein-
berger comes from Geneva, and Shir-
ley Rugh and Dorothy Marshﬁeld are
from Grove City.

Freshman Gridders
Prepare For Season

Yearlings Get Under Way For Schedulels Opening As
Varsity Squad Tapers Off For Season’s Starter
VVith Ohio Wesleyan Saturday

With everything about as quiet as
a Scotchman at an auction sale on
the varsity side of the Trees practice
field, Frosh Coach Mike Milligan and
his 35 candidates for the freshman
football team are busy going through
the ﬁrst stages of training for their
season which opens October 17.

Starting practice a few days ago,
the freshmen are more concerned
with getting kinks out of unused
muscles than starting lineups. Actual
scrimmages and division of the play-
ers according to ability is something
like Hoover prosperity, it’s still
around the corner.

The .schedule for the yearlings as
far as it has been completed ﬁnds
the younger Pitt footballers meeting
five teams. During the season Penn
State’s frosh, Tech freshmen, Navy
plebes, ‘West Virginia’s yearlings,
and the Kiski team will meet the
Little Panthers.

Wesleyan Dangerous

Just across the ﬁeld Dr. “Jock”
Sutherland is taking things a triﬂe
-easier tapering his varsity squad off
for the opener this Saturday with
‘Ohio Wesleyan. That is, Sutherland
is not taking the Bishop game easy,
the practice sessions have merely
.stopped being tough.

-On the contrary, Jock and the
‘varsity expect plenty of trouble on
Saturday. Ohio Wesleyan seems to

have a mania for upsetting big teams<

 

in the first game of the season and a"‘

victory over the Panthers or even a
tie would make the Bishop season a
success almost before it started. Last
year the Ohio boys pulled a quicky on
Colgate in the very opening game and
surprised the Red Raiders and every-
«one else by nosing them out, 7-0.

This season the Ohio Wesleyan out-
‘ﬁt has 13 lettermen back. Even at
that, reports have wriggled from
Delaware, Ohio, to Pittsburgh that
three sophomores will probably be in
the starting lineup Saturday for the
-Ohioans. One of these sophomores,
Pat Brooks, is said to be one of the
ﬁnest passers in Ohio. Brooks slings
..a bullet-like pass and if they click
.against the Panthers as they did in
scrimmage sessions, the Panthers will
help Aspirin-stock holders make some
money.

Up on the practice ﬁeld the Panther
starting lineup is very nearly com-
plete. Only one or two question
marks remain before Saturday. Per-
haps the most diﬁicult post that has
question marks all around it is the
-center position. At present, Don
Hensley and Henry Adams are neck
and neck in the battle for the varsity
place. Hensley is probably the favor-
ite but no one would be greatly sur-
prised if Adams starts the ﬁrst game.

Another important battle for posi-
tions is «centered around the quarter-
back post. Johnny Michelosen, last
year’s regular, is having a hard time
keeping ahead of Arnold Greene, a

senior who is shooting all he’s got this 

season for that starting job. If
Michelosen was the favorite two days
ago, Greene has come up fast and now
appears to have the odds favor him.

Most of the other positions on the
ﬁrst eleven are decided, although

Tracl<men Begin Workouts
Deiying Autumn Chill

Even though fall is here again and
a young man’s fancy turns towards
thoughts of topcoats, Carl Olson, var-
sity track coach, is sending his track-
men through their cross-country paces
with little more than usual cross-
country get-up, shorts and jersies, as
protection against the autumn winds.

Running hither, thither, and even
yon through Schenley Park, which
serves as the cross-country practice
route, is a typical Olson track unit.
This, by way of explanation, means
it’s pretty good. VVith such names as -
Johnny Woodruff, who, incidentally,
didn’t take much time to run around

a stadium in Berlin last summer, .
Harold Tost, Alex Leggin, and George '
Cook, it must be pretty good.

In addition to these established
runners, is a batch of sophomores, up
from last year’s undefeated freshman
cross-country team. T-hey include:
Jimmy Filson, winner of last year’s
Intramural cross-country race, Bob?
Cogswell, Alex Zamborski, and Frank
Bonurati.

Sam Musico, one of the cross-coun-
try stalwarts of the past few years,
despite an appendicitis operation
which kept him out of the running
most of last year, is on the sick list
again. Another setback to the team
was the withdrawal from school of
“Pinky” Theriault.

Sutherland may make a few last
minute changes. On the line will
probably be Shaw, Matisi, Dalle
Tezze, Hensley or Adams, Glassford,
Delich, and Souchak. The backﬁeld
will probably come out with Michel-
osen or Greene, LaRue, Goldberg, and
Patrick.

THE PITT NEWS

Feely Plans Strong Intramural Card
For Fraternity, Independent Groups

All the quiet on the intramural
front will be disturbed quite violently
when Martin Feely, director of intra-
mural activities at the University,
announces the intramural athletic
schedule within the next ten days.

Intramural competition will official-
ly open at the end of the fraternity
rushing period, when the Greek let-
termen return to gridiron togs.

With only a few minutes remaining
to play in last year’s championship
football game, Marty Groat whipped
a pass to Paul Mahoney to enable the

Kappa Sigma eleven to eke out a. 6-0

victory over the highly favored Delt
aggregation.

Independent competition will start
as soon as enough teams sign up to
form a league. Such teams are re-
quested to see Mr. Feely as soon as
possible.

Everybody who is carrying twelve
credits and is scholastically up to
standard is eligible to compete.
Varsity and freshman performers are
not eligible to participate while they
are representing University teams.

Entry forms for intramural tourna-
ments will be available at the Dean
of Men's Oﬂice or from Martin Feely
in the Trees Gym the earlier part of
next week.

Special Spectroscopy Class
Attracts More Students

The University physics department
will retain its specialcourse in “In-

the Pittsburgh district last year.
Last year 30 students were enrolled
in the course, and already there have
been many applications for more lab-
oratory work in this ﬁeld.

Students who take the course will
study the principles and technique of
making spectrographic a alyses, and
will discuss applications of this meth-
od in the ﬁelds of metallurgy, miner-

Fraternity Women With 2.5 Averages Will Be Honored
By Scholarship Committee; Events Scheduled

Panhellenic Council was formally
opened at a special dinner meet-
ing previous to the beginning of
school. The meeting, conducted by
Jean Lawson, C37, president, was
highlighted by a d-iscussion of the
coming year’s program and events.
The Council made up of two repre-
sentatives from each of the women’s
fraternities, and as special guests of
the group, the presidents of each fra-
ternity attended.

After the dinner the president wel-
comed all the new associate members
and asked the full cooperation of the
entire body for the coming year.
Miss Thrysa W. Amos, dean of
women, spoke as a representative of
the faculty committee. 0

Chairmen of all standing commit-
tees reported to the group. The so-
cial committee with Marion Messer,
C37, chairman; Ruth Greene, C37;
Sylvia Briggs, C39, and Lucille Upte-
graﬁ’, C39, outlined their plans for a
coming social season. The plans in-
clude a meeting, October 5; freshman
reception banquet, November 4;
pledge luncheon, March 18; Panhel-
lenic Ball, April 16.

The mass meeting, the ﬁrst of its
kind at the University, will gather to-
gether all the fraternity women for
the purpose of trying to develop a
more friendly attitude among frater-
nity women.

Vivian Roberts, Ed38, chairman of

the freshman education committee,

outlined her work for the year. Her
committee consists of Ruth Custer,
C39, and Estelle Herman, Ed38. The
freshman education committee pre-
pares the Panhellenic material used

Offered Early History

Of University In Newspaper Feature

Grows From Three-Room
Log Cabin To Recent
Cathedral Addition

Campus men already know that the
150th anniversary of the founding of
the University is to take place this
year. Pittsburghers are just ﬁnding

out.

Last Saturday’s issue of the maga-
zine section of the Pittsburgh Press
carried a two page history Of lfhe
the student’s Compass companion
does not say, but the style is breezy
and the few “new” points that are
made are somewhat enlightening.

The article points out the delicate
setup of the embryonic University
known as the Pittsburgh Academy.
“The Revolution and Washington
were then good topics for timely con-
versation, and the Indians were still
picking up a scalp here or there as
opportunity afforded . . . There was
some talk about establishing Alle-
gheny County—to materialize about a
year and a half later—and the town
had a total of 140 families. None
felt too secure.

University. There is little there that
“Park Guns At Door”

"So school took up almost within
the shadows of the fort, doubtless a
strategic location, for the town was
to have worries about invaders for
several years to come. It was a
strange and venturesome idea.”

With guns checked at the door, in-
stead of chewing gum under the writ-
ing arm of the chair, and a knife

snugly tucked inside the student’s
boot, the classes of the Academy must
have provided a few thrills.

The school, we know, was founded
by Judge Hugh Henry Brackenridge,
Princeton graduate who later became

justice of Pennsylvania’s Supreme
Court. The courses, the article states,
“included ‘the learned languages and
English’ (such phraseology giving oc-
casion for raised" eyebrows), mathe-
matics, fencing and Scottish dancing.”
The mathematics course was but a
stepping stone to engineering.

The ﬁrst principal of the Academy
was George Welch, who assumed of-
ﬁce when the charter was granted by
the State Legislature in “the town of
Pittsburgh for the education of
youths in useful arts, sciences and
literature.” This was in 1789.

Fires Delay Progress

Joseph Stockton served as head of
the school from 1810 to 1819 and was
the last principal of the academy. The
school grew and was re—incorporated
as the Western University of Penn-
sylvania at the end of Stockton’s
term.

The college became better organized
in 1822 when Rev. Robert Bruce be-
came principal and professor of nat-
ural philosophy, chemistry and mathe-
matics.

Then came the ﬁre and the civil
war and the University, weakened a
bit, carried on. In 1865 the,Al1egheny
Obesrvatory became a part of the
University and developed from the
Allegheny Telescope Society to the
Observatory as Prof. Samuel P.

Academy Changes To WUP
Under Stockton Rule,
School Enlarges

Langley found it and brought the in-
terest of the world to his work.

Langley’s co-worker, “Uncle” John
A. Brashear, continued with the Uni-
versity and built the instruments that
made him famous. It was Brashear
who was, in a large part, responsible
for the construction of the present
Observatory. In 1890 the University
moved to a new site on Perrysville
Avenue. Five years later, upon the
announcement of Dr. John Crocker
White, president of the Board of
Trustees, that two young women had
been admitted into the University,
the school became co-educational.

Moved In 1908

In 1908 we moved to the Oakland
district and became known as the
University of Pittsburgh. In 1921
Dr. John G. Bowman was inaugu-
rated, and under his chancellorship,
the school grew to its present size.

“The University has grown,” the
article concludes, “from the three-
room log cabin of 1781 to an insti-
tution-comprising 17 schools and di-
visions, including such outstanding
members as the Mellon Institute of
Industrial Research. The University
has kept pace with Pittsburgh’s prog-
ress, and even as the original log
cabin matched the architecture of the
day and the rugged teachings met the
needs of the day, so does the present
University still keep time with Pitts-
burgh in style and progress.”

Junior Election

Political ballyhoo bursts forth on
the campus for the ﬁrst time to-
morrow when the engineers group to-
gether in each of their ﬁve seminars
to elect Engineering Association cab-
inet representatives and seminar oﬂ‘i-
cers.

Of greatest importance is the elec-
tion of the junior representatives to
the Association from each of the ﬁve
seminars. The election of senior rep-
resentatives is merely a formality by
which surviving Association members
are re-elected.
