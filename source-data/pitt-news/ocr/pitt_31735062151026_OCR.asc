p This is the first installment of Plttites now‘ in the service. As ex-
plained in the last issue of the “Weekly.” no rule has been followed in pub-
lishing these names. The Se_creta'i'y-‘has hundreds of memos, newspaper
clippings, etc., containing this data'- and, he_ has selected it promiscuously.
Owing to lack of space, the “Rol1;of_ Honor" could not all be published at
one time-hence the decision to publish a few names each week. .
Alumni who are in the army or‘ navy are urged to send in their address,
etc., for this‘ list. It will make our  allthe more accurate if they ad-
vise us. Send not only your  but names of other Pittites you
know to be in the service. ’ J   «.

‘ Panthers Gain an Easy’

Victory: Over Bethany

 

‘*1 West Virginia Men No Match
for W,arner’s Huskies— De-

feated 40-0.

Q1.‘-'.&u

Though met by a hard-ﬁghting and
desperate aggregation of 'men from
Bethany College, the Panthcrites had
little trouble in annexing the victory
last Saturday, they seeming to score
at will until the ﬁnal score stood 40
to 0; In _fact the vis'itors at no time
had a chance of crossing the goal line,
making only two ﬁrst downs during

the entire time of play.

The Bethany eleven was entirely
outcllas-sed, and from the first blast
of -the whistle to the end of the fourth
quarter, the Gold and Blue men had
things their own way. However, it
must be said that the V\/est Virginians
were outweighed to the man, the
heavy Piitt eleven crushing them at
every turn. Pitt made all of -its scores
in ‘two pe-riodis, th-e «first and the last,

20 points ‘being ma:de in each.

second and third periods. ‘Pop VVarner
sen:t‘in his second-string men and
Bethxany seemed more successful than
when lined up against -the ﬁrst-string
men, they holding our team scoreless
- during these per-io-(ls.

The game was rather poorly at-
tended, -for an Iinitial. game, but this
may be partly accounted for because
of the threaltevning weather which,
however, turned i-nto an :ideal football

day. The University band,

’ strong, was on the ﬁeld, ‘however, and
I gave a good ac-count -of itself on its
initial appearance, «marching around
the ﬁeld both before and after the
game. The world’s series results
were -also «bulletined by innings on

the score ‘board.

In the ﬁrst period Plitt got the‘
jump on its opponents by making
three touchdowns, the -inital one com-
ing «during the ﬁrst four minutes of
play. It was the result of several
"forward passes and long runs by
Easte-rday, McLaren and McCarter,
McLaren going through center for ten
yards across the line. Sies failed goal:
McLaren carried the ball over the line
a «few minutes later, aided by the work
of M.cCarte-r- and East-erday._ The
long run ‘on this advance was made
by Easterday, when he got around
left end on a ~c'nis~s-c-r«os's for 15 ya-rds.
V Sies kicked goal. Eastertday made the
third and _ﬁ_ri.al touchdown of this
period when he received a long for-
ward pass from McCarter, and had a
‘clear ﬁeld before him. Sies
kicked goal, bringing the score for.
i this‘ period to 20-0. -
Then for [two periods the Warner

‘ing was concerned, both teams having
made several substitutions at this
time.

At the beginning of the fourth
quarter, Pop Warner sent several of
the old men back in the line-up, and
the Bethany goal line again ‘became
the prey of our men. It was Dave
P-itler. the individual star of the con-
test, who ‘scored two touchdowns in
succession, being followed just before
the whistle blew 'by the least touch-
ldown of the ‘game when C-aptain
Carlson crossed the goal line. Pitler,
playing halfback at the time. made
one of the prettiest runs of the game,
when -he ran 35 yards for a 1touc'h-
down, dodging his opponents and ex-
hibitiing a ‘bit of open-ﬁeld running
not seen for some time. Sies mnssed
goal. Dave’»s other touchdown came
as the result of a series of line
plunges in which he was the main ﬁg-
ure, he ﬁnally was able to cross the
goal line after a terriﬁc line plunge.
Sies made this goal. A few minutes
later, after the Pitt -mac-hine had run
the ball close to Bethanyls goal line,
Pitler agaiin made himself prominent
by throwing a perfect forward pass
straight into the hands of Carlson,
who stood waiting for it with an open
ﬁeld before him. He easily scored
the touchd-own. Sies kicked this goal,
making it four out of six.

VV-ortmasn, Elder and A. B-ows-er did
the work ‘for the \Nest Virginians, or,
rather, the major part of it. Elder
was everyw~here at once, while at full-
back -he played an exceptionally
prom-inent' part. Bowser is playing
his sﬁrst "re-al football, he being still a
youngster, and with a few years’ de-
velopment will «prove a very valuable
man.

This «is the ﬁrst game in history

In Game; Next Saturday

FRESH OPEN
WITH KISKI.

The Freshman eleven will open its].
season Saturday at Kiski. From pres-
ent -indications this game will be the
hardest on the Freshies schedule and,
coming at it does the ﬁrst thing,
means that the 1921 squad .has a great
task confronting it to get in shape for i
the game.

Coach Kerr has been lo-oking his
men over d-uring -the ﬁrst week of,
practice and this week it Wlill be hard
work at -all times with plenty of
scrimmages to keep the candidates on
their toes. The line-up has not yet
passed the experimental stage and
Prof. Kerr will try out various oom-
blll3JlIlOIl‘S in an effort to secure the
one which will make the best showing
against the Black and \Nhite. He has
a large list of candidates to work with
as the s-quad was greatly increased;
last week ‘after practice was under‘
way.

Kiski’s feat in holding the greatly
touzted champions-to—be from VVash-
ington and Jefferson to a 17-7 score
in a game which many critics said
should have been Kisiki’s, shows that
the Saltsburg aggregation has the
stuff. They will be a ‘hard bunch fo-r
the Freshies to beat. especially since
it will be the yearlings’ ﬁrst trial.
while Kiski has already put two

games vbehtind her.

Next Saturday Forbes‘Fie1d will be
the scene of the ﬁrst real -test for the
Blue and Gold football team when it

matches its eﬁﬁcie-n-cy as -a scoring ma-

from Lehigh. All through the week
the Panther gri.d:der‘s have been grind-
ing away gnder the incentive of keep-
ing their record clear of a defeat for
the -season. In the laboratory of the
Beihally gamethe Peerless Pit-t coach
tried out new combinations and new
plays, and, with the data of that day
before him", he is preparing his war-
orippled machine fo-r the acid test
with Lehigh.

The play last Saturday was ‘ta’ bit
ragged in places, especially during the
-third c'1uar'ter, but the team has not al-
together recovered from its habitual
CW1)’ season lethargy, and then the
Bethany game caught them in the

high team. The process of pointing
for the~ Be=th‘ehem crew had just
reached the lowest ebb when the
Panhandlers had to"be met and con-
sequently the team was not in the best

while the visiting aggregation will he

In the times past the Le.high men
have been noted for the strong teams

best in the country and his teams
have always been -considered among
the most dangerous toes of Yale, and
