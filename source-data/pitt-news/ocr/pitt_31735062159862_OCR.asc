THE UNIVERSITY or

‘K

  Alumni Plan Homecoming Fete

has been cancelled this year, J. Clyde Barton, general alumni
secretary, feels that the Nov. 10 celebration will ' be the
finest Homecoming Pitt has ever had.” i —
Student Congress cancelled the dance when there were
110 applicants for chairmen, but Mr. Barton revealed that he
_also had requested the dance’_s cancellation because it inter-

_terred with other I-Iomecoming¢

activities. '
\ The annual Homecoming dinner
sponsored by the Varsity Letter
Qlub will be held Friday evening,
Nov. 9 at the Hotel Schenley.
ﬁpeakers for the program include
Mayor David L. Lawrence, Cap-
tain Tom Hamilton, Dr. Eddie
Baker, Carnegie Tech football
coach,
coach of the Pittsburgh Steelers.
Reservations can be made

through Ticket Chairman George.

Barton stressed.

dents will participate in during

Mr. Barton feels that this year’s

years due to the fact that Pitt is
playing a traditional rival in,Ohio.-

— 1 Donors-under 21» years of age must bring a signed paren-g ,
tal consent form with them when they appear for the ap-~ 0'

student can secure another at the Student Desk. ’

Instructions To Donors

Donors should not eat any fats, including cream,
butter, fried foods, bacon, etc., in the four-hour period‘
immediately before their donation of blood.

It is permissible, and even recommended that donors
take a small -non-fatty snack before giving blood. This
snack could consist of fruit juice, salad, or candy bar..

All donors ‘under 21 years of age must bring a note ’
showing parents’ consent for the donation.‘

, D11 SAE Bus

See Editor1'.al——Page 4

Student Congress will take no

punitive action against Sigma Al-
rpha Epsilon fraternity. .
«' The SAE’s hired .a bus for the
trip to the Michigan State game,
while Student Congress was trying
to sponsor a student train, which
eventually folded for lack of stu-
dent participation.
Jim Johnston, chairman of
Congress’ social committee, ex-

plained that if social regulations »

had been interpreted broadly in
this case, the SAE’s could have
been subject to a ﬁne of $50. A
Social rules state that no student
organization may sponsor a pri-
vate function simultaneously with
an all—student_ function.

According to Johnston, the stu-
dent. train could have been inter-
preted as a social affair, since any
gathering of men and women stu-
dents is considered a University
social affair.

Johnston said that the social
committee is drafting a new deﬁ-
nition that will cover and prevent

4 recurrence of projects such as the
SAE bus. '

SC’: True Colors?

The Michigan traih ﬁasco is now a matter for.University
history. Its failure should serve as ‘a lesson for the future
chairmen of such trains in the freshmen, sophomore and
junior classes. _ . ~ ‘ ’ ’

Future members of Student Congress should also re-
member that group’s attitude toward the SAE’s who char-

tered a bus inconﬂ-ict with the train. Congress had an ex-

cellent opportunity to assertitself and ﬁne‘ the, fraternity.
Theywere content to ignore the Whole thing.

The lesson here explains why Congress is generally re-‘

garded as nothing ‘more than a sewing _circle, composed
mainly of people who are concerned only. with their position
in the yearbook. They also are interestediin political con-
siderations. ~ . . ‘

c For just why did they refuse to take any concrete action
against a group which violated the regulations they them-

selves have set up. Was it because they -were afraid to, be

nasty; afraid to ‘offend some really regular guys, or just
afraid? ,
They have demonstrated a“failure of nerve and lack of

. _ conviction which is not at all surprising.-. If what they are"
‘ doing is not really important enough to defend by some con-
, crete action, why do it? ' I

He goes to the game on Saturday, has his pulse

Oath Bill Debaled

(Editors note: The boldface_,names. refer to the

The ﬂurry caused in Pennsylvanialasti spring,

by the Pechan Loyalty Oath Bill continues unabated
at Penn‘ State and the University of Pennsylvania.

And 48 more non-signers of a similar oath at
the University of California have
pressured the Board oflRegentsg
governing body of the University,
into passing a resolution in their
favor. .
The Daily Collegian

Faculty groups at Penn State
have come out recently as op-
posing the passage of the Pechan
bill."

The Graduate Students Asso- .
ciation sponsored apublic forum last week, during
which both professors and public officials explained
why the bill is “unnecessary, ineffective, and dan-
gerous”, , ' (,

_Scott Keyes, professor. of ‘economics, termed it
more than a simple loyalty oath, since the S-27
now has been amended to include a questionnaire
and “investigations in which any kind of evidence
is permissible.” , '

He added, “The purpose of the bill is to ease the
dismissal of unwanted persons.”

The Panthers will be after their

However, Rice’s showing is also
questionable since the Owls have
taken the title as “the Southwest’s
most unpredictable team.”

Jess Neely’s squad sports a 2-3
record this season—-victories over
the Naval Academy-and Southern
Methodist, and losses to Clemson,
Louisiana State, and Texas.‘

The unpredictable angle rises
from the fact that Rice lost its
opener to Clemson, a so-so team,
20-14, and then upset SMU, 28-7,
stopping Fred Benners—a feat
Notre Dame couldn’t do.

Looks out of place, doesn’t it? Actually it’s serious busi-
ness. The above numbers indicate the Offensive yardage-
passing and rushing—that Pitt and its last three opponents

have recorded.

The first three numbers indicate yardage by Iowa, Notre’

The last three

numbers -indicate Pitt’s oﬁensive¢

clubs. ._ 5
On the ground in the last three ,

"which isn’t good in the least.
Bestwick Great

ent story especially last Saturday
when the Panthers threw a human
‘thunderbolt in quarterback Bobby
Bestwick against Michigan State.
Bestwick proceeded‘ to shoot him-
self through the Spartan pass,de-
fense for 26 completions of 39
tosses and 335 yards.

‘I doubt if Bestwick could ever
be better than he was on Sat-
urday. Unlike State’s passers, Al ‘
Dorow and Don McAuliﬁ’e, Best-
wick had only a split second to

with the pigskin. And the way
end Chris Warriner repeatedly '
got past the State secondary, one
began to wonder if pass defense
p-wastaught at Lansing.
_ -,But the ‘Panther secondary was
in the ballgame. ’I doubt if anyone
‘ has ever kept records on the high-

defensive back in one game, but
Ray Ferguson and Henry Ford
must come mighty close after Sat-
urday’s fray. .
Ford, Ferguson‘ Overworked
One Spartan fan inquired as to
just what position Ford was play-
ing. When told, the fellow replied,
“He’s just running all over that
ﬁeld chasing down ball carriers.”
Spartan backs were coming
from all sides at the Pitts, and
Ford and Ferguson "were there
to__ flag them down, but unfor-
tunately the secondary is usually
too late to stop ﬁrst downs.
And my what speed those Spar-
tan backs had. They were running
like deer all day. As oneispartan

will take a mighty good ball club
to stop those Spartans.-

‘ The Spartan offense, a mixture
of T formation and single wing
plays, was a real credit to Lowell
‘Red’ Dawson, who is being touted

as Pitt’s next head football coach. »

Of course the athletic" plant
and surroundings probably had
plenty to do with luring. these
speedy gridders to the Michigan
State campus. As one Panther
footballer who formerly attend-
ed Michigan State put it, “They
showed me the campus while I
was a senior in high school and
I was sold on the ﬁrst look.”

Here at Hitt wesrave abou.t.‘$11/2‘

State the athletic department has ,

spent $35 million for athletic im-
provements since the end of the
war! /

Coach Not Named Yet

As for Dawson becoming Pitt’s

next football coach the following is '

certain:
1. He has not been signed.
_ 2. He would take the job but is
satisﬁed at State. . V ,
3. He has not been approached
by Hamilton since August.
.4. Given the men to work with
he can produce a strong offense. _

5. Head coach won’t be named I

until after the close of the football
season.

6. The next few months in re-
gards to the new coach are go-
ing to be interesting. Let’s hope.
they’re not tragic.

. Passing Duo Rewrite Books;

1 Bestwick, Warriner SetFi_ve ‘

Pitt’s greatest passing team,
quarterback V Bobby Bestwick to
end Chris Warriner, is rewriting
the Pitt record books this season.
They have a good start too, after
their outstanding performance at

‘Michigan State.

Bestwick and Warriner crashed

Bestwick * Warriner
ﬁve marks—fOur ‘for Bob and one
for Chris. And at the rate they’re
moving a half dozen more records
will fall‘ before they’re ﬁnished.

109 Pass Completions
Bestwick erased Paul Rickards’

- record of 1944 and 1947 of 90 com-

pleted passes when he threw 26

V t-"completed passes of 39 attempts.

The new record is 109 and Bob has
ﬁve more games to pad his mark.
Another Rickard mark of 23
completed throws in ‘one game
. against Army in 1,944 was smashed

when Bestwick hit true for 26.
And then there was the late Bill
Dutton’s record set in 1942 against
Ohio State when the former Pitt

‘halfback gained 308 yardsrushing

and passing.
I Chris Catches No. 41

Bestwick’s personal total offense
covered 331 yards. He also erased
his previous high of 252 aerial
yards wherr_,he gained 345 yards
through the air. ‘

Warriner broke Nick DeRosa’s
pass catching record by one when
he caught his 41st pass as a Pan-
ther Saturday. '

Bestwick; tied Rickard’s mark of
most passes thrown (193) in last
Saturday’s encounter.

West Virginia’s Mountaineers
couldn’t cope with Pennsylvania’s

hills on Saturday and they were -

left far in the dust on Schenley
“Killer Hill.” This steep

is aptly named because it always
separates the men from the boys
in cross-country meets.

The ﬁne running of Carl Olson’s
thinclads enabled the locals to
notch their fourth win in ﬁve‘
starts, 15-48.

_ Bernie Luterancik, Frank Kuz-

_ma, Don DelliGatti and Ken Ma-

hanna crossed the ﬁnish line to-

~ gether for a _ﬁrst place tie. Their

slow. time of 23:13 was due only
to the fact that the visitors were
out of the race by the ﬁrst mile
and the Panthers just breezed
home.

‘Russian’ Delegate   Imitates Malik  
At   Model Session

It’s hard to be a Russian nowadays and still keep your
friends, but Doris Lyda -has managed just that. —

— - At the request of Mrs. Batz, executive secretary of the

‘YWCA,-Doris took on the job of representing the USSR

at the model UN session of Oct. 24.
. Her task was to present the
Russian, Communist viewpoint.
For two weeks, before the ses-
sion, Doris supplemented her in-

ing. the United Nations -bulletins.
She rephrased the Russian dele-
gate Malik’s sentiments so that she
could give an exact representation
_of his attitude _ ‘in the Security
Council.» .
C ‘ Russians Walk Out

At ﬁrst, all the people serving

Doris would attempt to walk out.
Soon she realized what an eﬁec-
tive way this would be of show-
ing the belligerent attitude of the

At the session, Doris _gave the

fense of Indian delegate Kumara-
puran Narayan’s proposed reso-
lution that Red China be, admitted
to the UN. * -

Doris, together with ‘her advisors
Louis W. Jbhnston of the polit-
ical science department and stu-

authentic part of UN proceedings, _

dent Cyril Wecht, walked out of
the session, leaving the snickers
of an amused audience behind her.

With her Russian role complet-
ed, Doris watched the rest of the
proceedings from Foster Lobby.

Comes From Criders Corners

What does Criders Corners, Pa.,
Doris’ home town, have to say
about all this?

At ﬁrst, no one but her family
knew of Doris’ part in the session.
They thought it was a wonderful
opportunity for her. After her
picture appeared on the television
show, Pitt Parade, the comments
began. . ' 1

She received no ﬁery accusa-
tions from the 150'population, al-
though she laughingly admits that

there are a few people who ‘might
get excited later and say some- my

thing.”
Doris feels that the model ses-
sion served its purpose and was
received enthusiastically.
She was pleased that everyone

While it runs contrary to my nature to argue with suc-

The fault lies, in part, with
author Lillian Hel1man’s insistance

play, a leisurely, superior expor-
ation into man’s soul, discovers
self-deceit, lust, and immaturity
there, but Miss Hellman has made
no attempt to complete the circle.
She takes not so much as a side-
long glance at man’s basic com-
passion, or his strengths or ideals,

of indictments. It is a superb piece

of writing but its one-sidedness
makes" it inﬂexible for the stage.
' Set in Boarding House

The scene of the play is a high-
priced boarding house near New
Orleans run by«Constance Tuck-

most part, middle-aged, and lik-

Lavish State Campus
Awes Pitt Ro oters

BY JOAN LISOTTO
Pitt students today are still talking about their trip to

Michigan State last weekend.

An estimated 125 Pittites accompanied the band and the

team to the Spartan-Panther game.
Busses provided transportation¢

for the bulk of the students, while
most of the others traveled by car.

Student Bob Barner said that
representatives if r o m Michigan
State’s student government and
publications not only met the bus
on which he was traveling but
provided a tour‘ of the 3600 acre
carriprs.
