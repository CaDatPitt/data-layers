The men’s basketball team has
advanced to the next round of
the NCAA Tournament, but its
victory is bittersweet for Pitts-
burgh’s police officers. I

Sunday’s win left one ominous
thought on Pitt police Chief Tim

_Delaney’s mind: Riots.

Until the Steelers won the Su-
per Bowl in February, Oakland
had never seen this type of de-
structive celebration, said Dela-
ney. ” .

So, the Pitt police have joined -

forces with emergency response

teams and- the University to pre-
pare for potentialriots if the Pan-''
thers win the NCAA champion- A

Money buys Victory in new ,NCAA bracket

by Drew Singer‘

Pitt can’t get past the Sweet lb,

even when basketball has nothing I

to do with it.
PayScale, "a company that main-
tains employee salary records,‘ ﬁlled

out an NCAA Tournament bracket ‘

based not on each tea.m’s talent, but
by comparing the salaries of each
school’s graduates. _' s ,

‘ While Pitt’s median graduate sal-

ary of $6_6,800 got the Panthers past
East Tennessee State and Tennes—T
see in the ﬁrst two games, it wasn’t
enough to overcome the Wisconsin
Badgers’ $72,800 in the Sweet 16
round of the Tournament.

“Salary is always important,” said
Barbarajuliussen, associate director
of Pitt’s Career Development Of-
fice. “It’s a fact of life that you have
to be able to support yourse .”

Pitt hosts
pre-law

boot camp

by Mike Macagnone
Stczﬁ‘-' Writer

Military boot camp is tough,
and so is law school.

For six weeks this summer,
40 students will participate in
an intensive program called the
Summer Regional Institute, that
covers the basics'of the legal pro-
fession. The Council on Legal
Education Opportunity runs this
program to help students with
undergraduate degrees prepare
for law school. .

V “It’s been described as law
school boot camp,” said Kevin
Deasy, Pitt law school’s associate
dean of students.

During those six weeks, stu-
dents will be covering as much

material as possible, said Deasy..

Because of the shortened time
span, parts of the program are

actually. more difﬁcult than law ‘
_ school, said Deasy. ,

The program is considered, a
good preparation for law school,

said, Deasy. Pitt sometimes re- -

cruits through the program, and
as many as four students "might
come to Pitt. '.
Since 1991, Deasy has taught
for the council at the University
of Missouri School of Law, Dick-
inson School of Law and Pitt. In

the CLEO program, schools and _

faculty generally try to exchange

.ideas and make the program as

comprehensive and consistent as
possible, he said.
. Deasy described the program’s

iparticipants as motivated and

“hungry to learn.” Many partici-
pants have gone on to" succeed in
law school and in their profession
beyond, said Deasy. The alumni
section of the council’s Web site
features partners in law ﬁrms,
professors and attorneys.

The students sent applica-
tions through the program’s ad-
ministration up_ until the Feb.
2 deadline and, once selected,

Library search engine receives

by  Stover _ Z
Stzzﬂ W/riter

Students searching fof re

_sources in the library can now

choose between a new for-
mat and the ‘original catalog to
track down the perfect book.

Web services librarian Jeff \V1s-

_ niewski said PITTCat+, the up— '

dated version of PITTCat, the
library’s in-house search engine,
offers library-goers a more in-
tuitive search method that mim-
ics Web sites like ‘Amazon.com.

SCHEDULE OF EVENTS

The new catalog allows users to
start with a broad search and then
reﬁne the search terms with a few
clicks of a sidebar, unlike the old ver-

sion, which requires first switching

to a different page and then com_-
pleting an advanced search to nar-
row the options, said Wisniewski;

For each search, PITTCat+
produces a word‘ cloud, a web
of related words based on the
original search ‘ term that helps

more accurate search, he said.

The U. S. Environmental Protec-

works to improve the quality of the
countyfs water. The program will
use the money to build new facilities
that will help stop the overﬂow of

‘Allegheny County sewer systems.

Rep. Mike Doyle,'D-Pa., had re-
quested the money to improve the
county’s sewer infrastructure in his
campaign this fall.’

Matt Dinkel, Doyle’s press secre-

Delaney agreed and said the police are
trying to send the message to students that
if they get out of control, they will be held
accountable for their actions.

If they bring couches, illegal ﬁreworks
or lighter ﬂuid, “they’re going to get
trounced,” he said.

chose a program to attend. This summer’s
programs are at Pitt and at the Southern Il-

— linois University Law School.

Admission is somewhat ﬂexible and can
allow students admission if they have less
than desirable LSAT scores or GPA, ac-
cording to the council’s Web site.

.— Since 1993, Pitt has hosted this pro-
gram eight times. The University plans to
apply every other summer, said Charmaine
McCall, the law school’s assistant dean of
admissions and ﬁnancial aid. McCall also
directs the CLEO program at Pitt.

“The students are really helped by this.
They’re being taught by the best,” said Mc-
Call.

The CLEO program is federally sub-

sidized and tries to minimize cost to par—.

ticipants. The six—week session costs $2,000

this year, and some students in need of aid-

pay as little as $200._

The CLEO program was founded byia
federal statute in 1968 to help diversify the
-legal profession, according to its Web site.
More than 7,500 students have participated
in the program since it began in 1968.

EDITORIAL

C   iNon-profit newspapers coillcl have potential P

It’s been no ‘secret in the past few

'~ years that the newspaper industry has

1 been struggling. Multiple papers have
, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy pro-
. tection, and several have closed down
. entirely. Meanwhile, advertising reve-
. nue dropped more than 25 percent in
: 2008, according to Barclays Capital.

’ But a new bill introducedby Sen.

 Benjamin Cardin, D-Md, would al.--

«E low newspapers to operate as non-
 proﬁt educational organizations sirni—
} lar to public broadcasting companies

 Under the bill, newspapers could ap— ‘

_, ply for 501 (c) (3) status 4 a tax status
 which applies to public and private
3 institutions performing religious, liter-
 ary, educational or charitable service

 
     

—— which would make their adver-
tising and subscription revenues tax-
exempt P"

The only catch'is that the newspa-
pers operating under this distinction

would be barred from endorsing po—_

litical candidates or programs as a part

of the IRS prohibition on 501(c)(3)

organizations  or attempt-
‘  to affect political campaigns '

So the real question of the matter-

is, would it be worth  news-
A papers unable to offer opinions on
important issues for the beneﬁt of
community education? _ '
It’s long been thought that free
speech, and speciﬁcally afree press,
is essential to the healthy functioning

would replace the sectet ballot election

of a democracy. The press is gener-

, ally the best outlet that people have to

learn about important issues and po-
litical candidates The freedom of the
press is guaranteed even in the US.
Constitution, .

In one respect,-this bill erodes that

‘ freedom by placing newspapers un-

der the purview of the tax code, so
that their operations could potentially
be subject to censorship by the gov-
ernment A paper operating under
tax—exempt status simply would not
be allowed to print certain opinions
under federal law ' V .
However, political endorsements

worth supporting newspapers as tax-
exempt organizations for the myriad
other services they provide And con-
sidering that the papers would still be

allowed to cover political events, even 1

though they’d be batted from editori-
alizing on them, it really doesn’t seem
like that extreme of a trade-off
Perhaps the largest concern about
the bill, then, isn’t the potential reality
that newspapers wouldn’t be able to
comment on political issues, but the
fact that it places some of the editorial
content under government control
It may not necessarily be a bad 
but it represents a huge change to the

Opera leaves room for imagination

by Kathryn Beaty
Staﬂ Wrder

, “Opera for a Small Room”

Carnegie Museum of Art
through July 19

A new installation at the Car-
negie Museum of Art provides a
view into the imagined world of a
man who lived in a small town in
Canada ‘his entire life, collecting
hundreds of records.

“Opera fora Small Room” is a
theatrical narrative that takes place
in a ramshackle wooden room ﬁlled
with records and shadows that shift
across the walls. Visitors can peer
into the space through windows
and spaces cut out from the walls.

The artists, Janet Cardiff and

George Bures Miller, were inspired -

to create the work when they "found

the record collection of the man

known only as R. Dennehy in a .

second-hand store in a small towns
in British Columbia.

They didn’t realize that every
record cover had the name R. Den-
nehy written on it until they got

home. That’s when they began to .

wonder what his life -was like, ex-
plains Karin Campbell, coordina-
tor for the installation.

. “They’re just fascinated with
the idea of who is this person who °
stayed in this one tiny place his
entire life, what would his house
look like, how would he feel,” said
Campbell.

Cardiff and Miller are interested
in the tension of desire and a lust for
what is absent. It can be felt  the
juxtaposition between the high cul-
ture of R. Dennehy’s opera records
with the culturally isolated location
of his western Canadian home.

Although Cardiff and Miller

found R. Dennehy in the telephone
book, they made the conscious de-
cision not to phone him, Camp-
bell explains, because they felt that
discovering the truth about his life
would ruin the fiction they created
for him. r

Cardiff and Miller perform the
life they imagined for R. Dennehy
in a small room on approximately a
20-minute loop.

The installation’s performance
begins‘ like a theater production
as the sound of  instru-
ments and an audience plays over

the speakers and then the lights go.

down and the narration begins.
“In the middle of a stage, a man

sits alone in a room surrounded

by records, turntables,” said R.

‘Dennehy,_as performed by Miller,

speaking in a deep, tired man’s
voice.
The narrator’s breath can be

heard, opera records play and are
shufﬂed by the hand of an invis-

be seen moving across the walls as

Fusion causes scientist to get cold shoulder

by Donald Campbell

Back in 1989, a few scientists at
the University of Utah received quite
a bit of_ ridicule from the scientiﬁc
community when they armounced
that evidence of cold fusion could
be found in what boiled down to a
complicated glass of water.

True evidence of -cold fusion
could revolutionize_the energy in-
dustry, as cold fusion can produce
potentially limitless amounts of
energypwith little or no  input.
The announcement was quite excit-

Staff Wrder

The 16th annual Pittsburgh A

Jewish Israeli Film Festival isn’t
over just yet. And for ﬁlm fanat-
ics, this is' not an opportunity to
miss.

“There ‘are ﬁlms you most-

likely won’t have a chance to see
in Pittsburg ,” said Kathryn Spitz

Cohan, executive director of the

ﬁlm festival. “Most of them won’t if

open in theaters.”
The festival features ﬁlms of

Jewish content to the Pittsburgh I

community from around the
globe in an effort to provide en-

tertainment while inspiring and

exploring Jewish history and val-

VUCS.

Moviegoers now even have
the opportunity to rate the ﬁlms
they view, something not offered
in previous years.

Benjy Davis provides ‘the lead vocals,

writing or co-writing every track. '
Originally formed as a folk-rock duo in
Baton Rouge, La., in 2001, the group ex-
panded its inﬂuences as well as its mem-

bership, creating a sound blending multiple

» styles with its original Southern roots.

Contradicting the intrinsic
sism of a self—titled band, The Benjy Da-

unassuming tone to them, conjuring the
nostalgia of Southern childhoods and ado-

sarily impressive in and of themselves, are
well suited to the music. ' L .
The lyrics come across as honest and

.heartfelt‘but are hardly .enthralling, lacking
‘any particularlyiclever wording or evidence

that the band wrote them to be sung.

Most songs discuss either bittersweet
memories, mainly concerning various com-
binations of girls loved and joints smoked,
or express contentment in uninteresting
romantic relationships.

The combined effect creates an album

but instead focuses on the

‘most mundane details. Lyrics like‘ “Pull

into the drive / Get out of the car / Hear
the sound of the dogs bark from inside /
We let them out / Let ‘em back in” don’t
capture the emotional intensity that Davis’

‘voice tries to lay into them.
Although perhaps any relationship that ‘
can be at best described as “a whole lot bet—.

caliber to begin with. A

One of the more engaging tracks, “Same

When compared, with other

by Mike Gladysz

Pitt coach Jamie Dixon has Big
East titles, 30—win seasons and the
NCAA record for most wins after
six years as coach.

He won a Big East regular-sea-
son title during his first year coach-

"  Pitt and has been to the confer-

ence title game four of six times.
Still, there’s something 
That’s because the Panthers, de-
spite being the Big East’s most con-
sistent winner over the last six sea-
sons and continually being ranked
in the nation’s top 25, haven’t ad—
vanced past the Sweet 16 under
Dixon’s watch. And according to

'one basketball expert, that blank

spot on his resume could be the one
thing that’s keeping him from being
mentioned with the coaching elite.
Bob Ryan, a columnist for the
Boston Glob_e who’s covered bas-

‘ketball for 40 years, said that if Pitt

makes a run to the Final Four this
season, Dixon has a shot at ‘being
mentioned among the elite coaches
in college basketball. _p 1
Still, Ryan said that you have to
look at what other Hall of Fame
coaches have done in the past.
“You have to remember that
Dean Smith was 21  in when
he won his first [title],” said Ryan.
“Dixon still has some time.”
Some time is an understatement

There is some serious stuff go-

And the  is, I’m not talking
about the NCAA Tournament.

in the NBA, where the heat is be- P

ing jacked up with year—end races,
things are gettingiinteresting. It just
might be some of the best pro bas-
ketball we’ve seen in a while.
It all starts with the three—way
gee for the league’s MVP award.
For most of the season, it’s been a
bimodal discussion. Either you had
Kobe Bryant, the reigning MVP, or
LeBron James, who has somehow
led the Cavaliers to the league’s best
record. But lately a former- team-
mate of both Kobe and Bron Bron
has catapulted himself into the con-
versation.

Experience, leadership aplus
for Panthers down the stretch

ing but haven’t yet surpassed last
year’s success. At the same time,
‘l’itt’s achievement in the Tourna-
ment has showed an addressing
of season struggles and an over-

' .coming of offensive losses.

i Losing last year’s support
of Marcedes Walker and Malo-

rie Winn, Shavonte Zellous has.

become Pitt’s No. 1' offensive
threat. Throughout the season,
the Panthers struggled to give
Zellous the assistance needed
when teams doubled up on their
nationally ranked scorer. None-
theless, the Tournament has giv-
en Pitt a new mot:ivation.to ﬁnd
the basket. Seven players touched
the ﬂooragainst Gonzaga, and
all seven players contributed to
the-Panthers’ 65 points. This di-
versiﬁed offense will be essential
in creating a challenging matchup
for any team remaining in the
Tournament.

V The problem: Pitt football
coach Dave Warmstedt often
says that the turnover ratio de-
termines a game’s winner. If this
really is the case, the Panthers are
in trouble.‘ Both Pitt and Gon-
zaga had crucial turnovers in the

ﬁnal minutes of the game, but.

 

ml

 Healthyuvins Ex

only the Panthers were able to
capitalize. ‘_ _ - .
Had the Bulldogs been able to

convert steals into points, Pitt’s'

season very well could’ve ended
in Seattle. All in all, I hope the
Panthers learned the importance

‘ of ball protection for the full 40

minutes.
Another aspect that may prove
detrimental for the Panthers is

unnecessary fouling. Whenever.

Gonzaga took the lead, the obvi-

' ously rufﬂed Pitt team responded

with an unwise foul. The Panthers
had a total of 16 fouls, including
one technical. Ten of those 16
came in the ﬁrst 14 minutes of
the second half. _
In a close game, when there
is plenty of time on the.'clock,
the last  you want to do is
send the other team to the line,

particularly, a team that’s free-

throw percentage was 100 per-
cent throughout the game.
It was _Pitt’s experience that

-came tlirough in the end. Al-

though this is just Pitt’s third ap-
pearance in the NCAA Tourna-
ment, all but one of the Panthers
(Shawnice “Pepper” Wilson) have
come this far before. In addition,

riggi-.  

'_ seniors Xenia Stewart and Zel-
lous led the Panthers in scoring_

throughout the struggle against
Gonzaga. '

Under their guidance and Pitt
coach Agnus -Berenato’s lead-
ership, the Panthers found de-

_ termination in the heart of the

storm. The hope for Pitt is that
this drive continues at least one
more round, and several aspects
of Pitt’s game pmake that goal

look promising.

In addition- to Zellous’ abil-
ity to overcome a scoring deﬁcit
and put up nine. points with four
minutes remaining -in the game,
the team as a whole showed fun-
damental discipline. When the

layups wouldn’t fall, Pitt racked,

up points at the line. The Pan-
thers went 20—of-22 in free—throw
shooting, with the two misses
coming from Zellous, who was

i . 10—of—1-2. '

Throughout the game, Pitt
knocked down foul shots ‘and, as

time ticked away, the Panthers’
free-throw shooting became more

accurate. Experience, determina-
tion and fundamental discipline
are key factors that give Pitt the
ability to stay competitive.

 players hopeto

take Dixon _to next level

Dixon, page 15.
Dixon, 43, has been a head coach
for only six years. And Smith, the

long-time North Carolina coach
who won two national titles in his

» career, was just one of the elite
coaches who took his time to win-

titles. p .
Syracuse’s_  Boeheim, another

‘ Hall of Famer, took over the Syra-

cuse program in 1976. His only na-
tional championship came in 2003
— 26 years after he took the job. It
took Connecticut’s  Calhoun,
another Hall of Fame coach, 13
seasons to win the title at Connecti-
cut. .

Ryan said, that the only reason
people even talk about Dixon and
the ‘Sweet 16 is because of how
successful Dixon’s been in every
other area. While .most coaches
don’t have the pressure to advance
as far into the Tournament after a
short amount of time with a team,

Dixon must deal with it because of _

how successful his career in the Big
East has been and how Pitt is always

mentioned among the nation’s top
' teams. " 1

“Pitt is the only school that has
to deal with this stigma every year,”
said Ryan. ‘“It started with Ben

[Howland] and continued with ]a- '

mie.”

But the Pitt coach‘ doesn’t even .

think about that stigma or take

-any of the so-called pressure into

account. That’s why Pitt assistant
Brandin Knight, who played at Pitt
when Dixon was an assistant, said
that Dixon doesn’t have to prove
anything. _

“We’re not going out saying,
‘Let’s win this one for coa_ ,’” said
Knight. “That’s something people
just blowup.”

Still, it’s the kind of thing that
some players talk about doing.
While freshman guard Ashton
Gibbs agreed  Knight, saying
that Pitt simply wants to win for the
team and the program, players like

sophomore Brad Wanamaker look,

at getting Dixon to the next tier of
coaching.

6 ‘‘It’s something we’ve talked
about,  for him,” said Wana-
maker. “We want to be that team to
get him over the hump. Us getting
him that far, it would be special.”

Piit plays Xavier Thursday night
in Boston. Should the Panthers win,
they’ll play the winner of the Duke-
Villanova matchup, which follows
the Pitt game on Thursday night.

Maybe for Dixon, this is the

i team to do it

“He said to us the other day,”

said Wanamaker, “that we’re his best ‘

team as far as bond and potential.”

Even in March Niadness, 
don't forget about the NBA

Burgos, page.l6

blocks came in the last 22' seconds
of the game to help seal the win.
With that game, Wade also become
only the ﬁfth player in league his-
tory to have at least ‘2,000 points,
500'assists and 150 steals in_a single
season. A p ‘

Wade has become a  man,

doing anything and everyt:hing-for-

his team to win. If I_had an MVP
vote, it’d be heading to Miami and
right onto D-Wade’s mantle. I

Wade, though, isn’t the only one
shaking things.up in the Associa-
tion. Down in Texas, the Houston
Rockets have quietly climbed into
the lead in the Southwest Division,-
bumping the vaunted San Antonio

.Spurs and claiming the second best

record in the W/estern Conference.

It’s no surprise the Rockets are
good, but it is surprising that they’re
this good and doing it without
their supposed best player,. Tracy
McGrady, who, as per usual, is out
for the season with an 

V

   

‘stow. Iss

T-Mac’s absence and the Rock-

et’s surge cements two things:

McGrady is cotton candy sweet.
He’s a punk, a loser and completely
done—zo in the NBA as a star player.

The other is that Yao  can lead

a team. -
Ming isn’t the ﬁrst guy to come

to mind when  vocal leader.

He’s a top-three center in the league,
though, and lately has been getting
his teammates involved and hush-
ing talk that the Rockets won’t be
able to do serious damage without
McGrady in the line up.

But with the ever—growing ver-

isatility of  Houston looks le-

git. In the waning moments of the
Rockets’ game against the Spurs on
Sunday,  popped out to the
high post —— not where you nor-
mally ﬁnd  _— and threaded a
chest pass to an unguarded Luis
Scola on the low block for an easy
layup. Game. . A
That’s why the Rockets are go-

ing to get out of the ﬁrstround of
the playoffs this year, regardless of
who they play. Thefll play unself-
ish, hard-nosed basketball and will
win with balance. and depth. It’s.

a page right out of the book the ‘

Spurs have written over the past de-

cade.  that yielded four cham-

pionships. ~ , _ 5 Z.

, From Wade in  to the
Rockets in Houston, the league is
showing itsﬁrange of styles. It might
be the individuallyspectacular or
the cohesive team play, but either
way the NBA is coming up with its
best play right when you expect it
to: down the stretch and into the
playoffs. '

So have fun with the [college

tourney, I know I will. But when ‘

April comes around, don’t forget
those guys  inthe dough to
be ballers, the ones who were good
enough to play on the next level.
You might witness‘ something
special. ' 0
