Students Face Insurance Hike  

cording to Student Health Service
Director Dr. JoAnne Robinson.

BY MATTHEW KENNEDY
Pitt students face an increase in
the cost of the University health

Robinson, who chairs the Student
insurance program next year, ac

Health Insurance Advisory Com-
mittee (SHIAC) charged with spe-
cifying Pitt’s insurance plan, com-
mented that spiraling medical
costs will dictate an increase,
unless there are cutbacks~in ,the
service provided in the current
policy.

“You have a choice,” Robinson
said, “but Pitt cannot get more
coverage for less. We can expect an
increase, that’s reality.”

   
  

One of the problems plaguing
Pitt’s insurance plan, according to
Robinson, is the volunteer enroll-
‘ment-of the policy-holders, which
encourages those foreseeing med-
ical expenses to sign on, increasing"
the number of claims on the group
plan.

Although University populations
have been traditionally considered
“low-risk” in the insurance busi-

Klein said he personally contacted

explained the coverage of the
company’s liability insurance.

_ BY PETE BUTCH
Students have approached the Livewire complaining the ‘
mathematics department had outlawed electronic

calculators for the ﬁnal exams. They consider it unfair,
since calculators are not an extension of one’s reasoning
process, but merely help one calculate faster with less
chance of error.

E.C. Kovacs, associate professor in the department,
explained the decision is not a department-wide one, but
 only for Math 22, 23, 24 and 80. In 22, 23 and 24, the
' ecision was made in seminars held for each course.
Departmental seminars are regular meetings held by
instructors of the larger math courses. Their purpose is to
enable the instructors to interact about student problems.
Separate seminars are held for Math 22, 23 and 24. This
' time of year they work to’ make an equivalent ﬁnal-for each

ness, Blue Cross-Blue Shield lost
over $500,000 in the first two years i
of its contract with Pitt, according
to Robinson.

“What people should realize,”
Robinson said, “is what a bargain
this program is for them. It would
cost an individual almost four times
as much to get the same coverage.

“But when you want coverage,
you have to pay for it. You're not
going to get more for less.”

The speciﬁcations drawn up by
the SIHIAC present_a significant
increase in coverage for Pitt stu-

. dents under the health insurance

plan, according to graduate student
Marc Hiller, a student involved
with the proceedings.

“We need a plan that will meet
the primary health needs of Pitt
students. I know I want to pay for a
plan that will serve the areas'I’m
interested in,” Hiller said.

Hillerreiterated that a cost in-
crease for the insurance policy is
inevitable unless there are cut-
backs in the policy presently sub-
scribed to by students.

“We were given a ball-park'esti*-
mate,” Hiller said, “that said if we
kept last year’s plan, even with no
expansion, we might face .a 50%
increase in premiums (the cost of
the policy).”

Robinson noted the number of
students enrolled in the University
student health, insurance plan has
dropped from the original 7000 in
1972 to the 5000 now- subscribing to
the policy.

R-Morris Faculty Strike 
Gamers Student Supportsiit

BY GENE GRABOWSKI.

Faculty at Robert Morris College,

in their third day of a strike over

wages and job security, have

.received general support by the

student body, ‘according to Robert
Morris Student Government Presi-
dent Rick Munsick.

‘_‘Everybody just wants to go back
to school,” said Munsick, a senior,
“but we're on the teachers’ side.-”

Munsick said, most of the 3,000

students are boycotting classes out
of respect for the picket lines, but
he added that many were worried
negotiations would drag on, jeop-
ardizing their graduation.

“We respect the
rights," Munsick said, “but if the
strike lasts more than a week, we'll
be forced to go back to classes.”

The Robert Morris administration
is conducting classes on a ﬁll-in
basis with deans and department

Here at Pitt, reactions to the strike

He explained, “Arithmetical
errors are unimportant, the emphasis is not on arithmetic
skills but concepts.” 4
Some students voiced similar opinions, saying calculators
were ﬁne for solving long and complicated physics or
chemistry problems in which accuracy is important, but
really weren't needed for these lower level math courses.
A quick check was made of other departments for their
calculator policies. '

“Most people will see that the

different than the one at Pitt,” Hall
said. “Working conditions, class

Hall added that the strike at" --
Robert Morris College is not
necessarily reflective of all faculty

I In Health Policy Costs

(Continued from Page I)

A. greater number of students
using coverage of parental health
plans was one of the reasons for the
enrollment decrease, according to
Robinson. He said a state law
requiring the use of a volunteer
enrollment for insurance programs
was another reason.

Hiller said representataives of
Blue Cross-Blue Shield had indi-
cated slight variations in enroll-
ment would not signiﬁcantly affect
the cost of the policy at Pitt. —

A set of speciﬁcations for the
coming year's health insurance
plan is being forwarded to insur-
ance companies for the submission
of bids, according to Robinson and
Hiller.

Peter Hoffmann, chairman of the
Student Health Advisory Commit-
te, expressed concern over the
scope of student involvement in the
health plan talks.

Hoffmann characterized student
involvement as “poor” and said
policy-holders and concerned
members of the University com-
munity were invited to a meeting
on the health insurance plan this
Friday at 8:30 am in the Sun Porch

of the SU Lower Lounge.

Students interested in studying a

warded for bidding should contact

Tuck Shop Buns
May Bring
Legal Settlement

(Continued from Page 1)
“While I can't imagine there
being any traumatic experience
involved, some people might un-

derstandably have been upset 
they bit into a large piece of glass,”?-. 7

Klein said.

But student Felice Newman, who
complained about the Tuck Shop’s
handling of the matter, said, “It’s a
scary thing to bite into glass. Your

.ﬁrst reaction is ‘Oh, My God,’ and

that's why I reported it.”

Newman said she found glass in a
sandwich she purchasedlast Thurs-
day in the Tuck Shop. She didn’t
notify the food service personnel
at first, but reported the incident to
the County Health Department.

“They said they’d examine the

hamburger, so I saved it. They‘_i“'\L
never showed up to get it, but at’ 

least it’s an official complaint,”
Newman said.

Like Katz. Newman said the Tuck
Shop was negligent for continuing
to serve the buns even after several
complaints had been lodged. “The
people in, the Tuck Shop and the
Bakery were all very nice, but if I
had gotten sick or cut, I would have
sued them both.”

Katz reduced the matter to one of
liability. He said he was not
physically injured by the glass, but
went to Presbyterian Hospital as a

precaution, at Dearden’s request. _ ,
. / ‘

Klein said,
apologize--there's nothing more to
do in all practicality. It’s a shame,
but I'm sure he (Katz) will do
something, "

He ﬁled Katz's complaint with the
Bakery’s insurance company, and
said, in any event, he is protected

by the company’s "liability insuf:

BY SUSAN MANNELLA

The major goal of this year’s
School of General Studies (SGS)
Council will be to structure the SGS
Cabinet to permit increased stu-
dent participation, instead of
relying only upon .SGS Council
xofﬁcers to implement programs,
/f";,5ident Beverly Cohn said.

“In the past, the president and
Council members went to every
function and did everything them-
selves,” Cohn said. “The way we
are structuring things now, all
students can participate in one area
without being over-burdened.”

Cohn said she hopes to raise
student awareness of SGS services
through a newsletter to be mailed
each term.

“We know every student in SGS
can't become involved. Most of
‘them work full-time and have other
committments. But hopefully, if
we inform them of what’s going on,

 an become active in areas
. .~.“" ' terest them,” she explained.

Council plans to solicit for SGS
student committee members,
rather than send Council members
to all inter-University organizations
on which SGS is represented.
These include-SGS Dean’s Council,
the University Review Board and
the Provost’s Committee on Un-
dergraduate Programs.
“Membership on committees
throughout the University keeps us

aware of what faculty,’ administra- »

tors and other students are doing
so we can comment on it. If we
don’t participate, we have no right
to complain when decisions are
‘handed down to "us,” said Cohn,

because a decision is supposed to
be reached in June. We don't want
to take anything away from SGB,
but we would like to be
represented. After a permanent
seat’is awarded, I want to screen
student applicants to act as
representative," Cohn said.

Another area in which Cohn said
student involvement is necessary
concerns state ﬁnancial aid to
part-time students. Aid would be
provided under a bill recently
proposed by State Representative
K. Leroy Irvis (D-Hill District).

“All SGS students will receive
mailers telling why we support the
bill and encouraging them to
contact their legislators. In
addition, Council plans to meet
with state appropriations and
education committee chairmen,”
Cohn said.

Programs implemented by last
year’s Council included establish-
ment of evening hours at the ID
office and Placement Center,
procedures for submitting course
and registration complaints, and
reduced athletic tickets rates for
part-time students.

This year’s Council plans to
continue and expand upon those
programs. I

contacted us, asking if we would
set up interviews for them. We'd
like to work on that and continue
the career day, sponsored by the
administration ofjustice fraternity,‘
Cohn said. ‘

Interaction among students al-
ready participating in the SGS
Cabinet also is included in Cohn‘s
priorities for the coming year.

“This is the first time there will be
representatives who are not mem-
bers of the Council. Anyone we
send to an inter-University council
meeting will have to present a
synopsis of what took place so we
can discuss it. Closer communica-
tion with the South Hills center is
definitely needed, too, and we plan
to visit South Hills to discuss their
plans for the year,” she said.

The SGS Alumni Association is
being reorganized and Cohn said
this could improve the SGS
graduates’ reputations.

“It’s difficult to apply for a job
and say you have an SGS degree.
Often, employers will say, ‘Oh, you
just went to night school.’ If we
get involvement from graduates
who have made it, we'll get a better
rapport with the business com-

 Could Happen Here

There is little satisfaction in a strike. Picketers don’t like them
because they’re a last resort; there is an underlying sentiment of
futility in knowing that a strike is one’s ﬁnal recourse in peacefully
solving a dispute. Those being struck obviously don’t appreciate them
because.of the ‘disruption of service.
.’Ihecm'rentfacultystrikeatRobertMorrisCollegecomesasaboonto
the University at a time when various elements here are arguing for

faculty unionization.

It gives us an opportunity to set aside the rhetoric found in testimony
at the Pitt unionization hearings and observe ﬁrsthand the effects of a

strike on students.

Robert Morris looks more like a srmll plant owned by US Steel than a
college, with its picketlines drawn and faculty members deserting the
classroom in favor of sign-carrying.

The big losers in any strike, whether at Robert Morris or at Pitt, are
the students. Robert Morris has a small enrollment--only 3,000--and so
some classes are still being held. But with 28,000 students at Pitt’s
Oakland campus alone, a strike would certainly cancel classes.

Even if it were possible for the administrators to ﬁll in as instructors,
asisbeingdoneatRobert Morris, there wouldbe no smooth transition
intheclassroom, asanystudentwhohashadteacherreplacements will
agree. Besides, many school oﬂicials would be wanting as instructors
because they’ve been inactive for a long time.

Add these to the fact the administration would be embroiled in the
strike controversy and you have a regretable situation in which the very
ones for whom the University exists, the students, would be locked out
and reduced to a helpless third party. ‘

The proponents of unionization at Pitt have used the argument that
the upper echelons of the University resemble a corporate structure. If
this is so, then why do the pro-unionists advance an equally
self-serving bureaucracy of their own? From the students’ point of

I ~< view, the last thing a large university needs is another system not

directly involved in the education process.

*istotallyunfoundedarxlmakesa_mockeryofthestudent-teacher
relationships vital to aliberal arts education. But an even graver insult
is the imposition of an unwieldy conglomeraﬁon that could serve as a
divisive force between faculty and administration.

As for students who must look on as pawns in a ﬁnancial game, a Pitt

" union will be cause for further isolation from the opportunity to learn.

No one wants to see the University become just another racket. But as
shown by the mayhem at Robert Morris College, it could very well

happen here.

Although I respect the philoso-

noteworthiness, I think a recon-

On Wednesday, the day following
“Meet the Landlords Day,” the
front page was devoted to faculty
unionization, a budget dispute by
an organization, and a proposal
regarding Oakland parking. This is
not to suggest that these things do
not deserve adequate coverage.

To the Editor:

I am writing in regards to the
article entitled “Reagan and the
Third Party” written by Pete Butch
that appeared in the Pitt News on
Wednesday, April 2nd.

First of all, I/am willing to grant
that the GOP is in  shape. I will
agree that only 18% of the people
identify themselves as Repub§-
cans, but ignore the fact that 42 “/6
of the voters in the November
election did vote Republican.

I will also agree that the Republi-
can Party is known for its conser-
vatism, but it is also known for its
liberals like Schweiker, Brooke and
Case.

I will disagree with you that the
Republican Party is the part- of

’ sure.

How Cold Is the Cold War?

BY TOM WASELESKI

By definition, a cold war is one
that is waged not openly, but

nerves, not of men. The cold war
following World War II is to be
given credit for the wide-scale
introduction of electronic public
surveillance devi_ces, enabling Or-
well’s not-so-mythical Big Brother
to arrive on the scene long before
1984. This is the price, so we’re
told, that we have to pay to keep
the hostilities between the United
States and the Soviet Union on ice.

It is true that in the 30-year Cold
War the two superpowers have not

_ incurred any loss of life on account

of each other. But that has not
prevented them from entering into
military conflicts separately. The
American ventures in Korea and
Vietnam and the Russian invasions
of Hungary and Czechoslovakia are
only a few examples. Short entries

But despite their limited
value to Americans and Russians,
they were battles that broke the
backs of whole nations. Ask any
Vietnameseior any Czech, and he
will tell you that for him there was
no such thing as a cold war. It’s,
just war. And in recent weeks, ,
signs of mounting hostilities have
become evident, perhaps forcing
the citizens of aloof superpowers to
feel firsthand exactly how war can
be.

from‘ a blue-collar famly in a
heavily Democratic area, I found it
quite easy to become the youngest
elected Republican State Commit-
teeman in Pennsylvania. Our party
is not closed to minorities, as you
would lead to people to believe; In
1972, the Pennsylvania GOP ran
the ﬁrst black for statewide office
other than a judgeship. The candi-
date was Glenn Williams, who ran
for State Treasurer.

Conservatives do not fear the

addition of this segment to the,
party, because such a group is

indeedra viable part of the party.

Conservatives are upset with def-
icit spending, because they realize
that it leads to "and contributes to
inﬂation and recession. As to the
third party talk, it is strong, but not
asstrong as you make it sound, To
you it is as if a third party is already
a reality. It. is not. Many GOP
conservatives, such as myself, are
still trying to work within the party
structure for realization of their
goals. A V-

A third party, I feel, would not be
a token party as you state. It would
serve as a rallying point for the
over 60% of the American populace
who identify themselves as conser-
vatives.

Your statement that the Demo-
crats could win big is a reﬂection of
your ignorance of the political
situation in this country. The
Democrats are just as factionalized,
if not more so, than the Republi-
cans. They have no strong leading

Portugal’s transformation into a

lems to NATO, which, already
concerned with disintegration of

the communists. A great moral
blow would be dealt the alliance, on
the other hand, if Portugal is kicked

At NATO’s eastern flank, Greece

settlement on Cyprus. And though
Turkey’s threat to withdraw from
NATO unless it received the
military aid it demanded from the

remains a threat nonetheless
because of numerous American

Dear Editor: I .
At a recent showing of Serpico

I two students observed question-

minutes approximately 35 people
were allowed to enter through the
advanced ticket door, and upon
reaching the inner door were
handed back a stub. It was obvious
to the two students observing the

‘Dance Is Guerilla

BY RITA VITOLO

Dancing combines the art of an
actor on stage with the work of a
painter on canvas in a live expres-
sion of movement. Get a company
that infuses that with a sense of
Afro-American heritage, and
you've got an explosive way of
looking at the art.

That company is the Pittsburgh
Black Theatre Dance Ensemble,
and it’ll be performing at the
Pittsburgh Playhouse the weekend
of April 18 in a beneﬁt kick-off for

Pitt’s African Heritage Classroom
Building Fund.

Theirs is an art for the people, and
frequently they take to the streets

to perform. This will be their first 7

performance in a “theatre.”
“Dance today is being petted and
pampered. Dance is like guerilla
warfare--it’s a weapon to expose, to
shake people, to reﬂect,” said Bob
Johnson, Black Studies instructor
of theatre and dance, and choreo-
grapher and director for the com-

pany.

BY CAL RITCHEY

There’s a cloud over the lives of at
least 11 Pitt students these days.
Those students, according to
foreign student advisor Bill
Lenaghen, are the Vietnamese who
attend Pitt.

The problem is what their fate will
be should South Vietnam fall to the
North Vietnamese army. Foreign
students in the United States
generally are living under a visa
good for up to one year. When
those visas expire, the students
may have difficulty obtaining a
renewal.

Warfare’

There’s a special experience
when dance is coupled with the
black experience, said Johnson:
“Dance reflects like a mirror to our
people to show them what they’re
like, and what they can be.”

The Ensemble came together in
1969 as a home base--“governed
by the people and supported by the
people”--for their energy, accord-
ing to Johnson, simply with people
interested in dance. Their starting
point was the Afro-American

Several possibilities are open to
Vietnamese student, according to
Michael Landon of Pittsburgh’s
office of the Immigration and
Naturalization Service. In the past,
refugees from disaster-torn coun-
tries--for example, Honduras and
Biafra--have been taken in on a
temporary basis. Congree, if it
chooses, may pass laws allowing
the refugees to stay permanently.

The students could ask for
political asylum, Landon noted.
But he said there has been no
contact between his office and the
State Department in Washington
regarding the granting of asylum.

The University has no plans yet to
offer official assistance to Viet-
namese students, said George
O’Bannon, director of International
Student Services at Bruce Hall.

“There has been just a mention of
it," O’Bannon said. “But first we
will need an indication from the
Immigration and Naturalization
Service that they will make
exceptions (to immigration laws) as
they did, for example, for Biafra.”

O’Bannon said there is an option
of special control available to the
Immigration and Naturalization
Service that would offer the
students greater job ﬂexibility.
Currently, foreign students are
being restricted from taking many

Physics and

Sci-Fi Bourses
. 
Coming for Far- ,

BY KEN MINARIK

The Department of Physics has
announced a special undergraduate
course titled “Physics and Science“
Fiction" will be offered this COff1l§‘{-

fall term. l

The course is [recommended for 
non-science majors, and no pre- I
vious experience in any of the ‘
sciences is required.

Taught by two graduate students,
the 3-credit course is designed for
both the avid science-fiction fan
and the casual “Star Trek”
watcher -who wants to get more
enjoyment out of science ﬁctio ‘T

The structure will be an informal“ C
seminar basis and no formal
lectures are planned. The reading
list consists of works from the great
masters--Isaac Asimov, Robert
Heinlein and Arthur C. Clarke
included.

Grading will be based on
short-answer and multiple-choice
quizzes, along with brief homework
assignments.

Time dilation, blackholes, the
structure of the solar system, and
the structure and geophysics of the
Earth--as applied to science fiction
--will be the topics in the course. _ .

Homework assignments will béfﬁijl
discussed in the next class hour, 
and the ideas extended to topics
such as the lifetime of cosmic rays
and interstellar ﬂight paradoxes.

The course aims to build cultural
appreciation for physics, as well as
for science fiction itself, according
to Elliot Eichen, one of the course’s
instructors.

“Physics has a pretty bad image,
especially here at Pitt where
everybody and his brother is a
pre-med,” Eichen noted. “I think
that a lot of people are getting an
anti-science attitude that ther
courses are irrelevant and ti" ‘;~
instructors are out to screw them
l“This course isn't out to ‘get’
anybody." added Eichen, “but
instead it’s out to make people
really appreciate the science

today it's an all-volunteer company
made up of doctors, lawyers,
businessmen and professionals.
‘Star’ mystique isn't tolerated.

“We eliminate ‘I want to be a
dance star,”’ Johnson said of the
company. “Send those. people to
New York. If they can make it, they
can make it there.”

7*‘)-’.§l1e Ensemble will present “Free

uapiiit Song,” a 30-minute celebra-
tion of the human spirit--choreo-
graphed by Johnson--at the Play-
house.

“The human spirit is a free spirit
song,” according to the troupe’s
spokesman, Bob LaPrince. “The
dance appeals to thebasic human
nature of all people under oppres-
sion, the oppression we all feel
from ehate, income /tax, crime,
oppression from ourselves. ”

The Ensemble believes express-
ing that spirit from an Afro-Amer-
ican heritage is all part of the cycle.

“The ‘Free Spirit Song’ is an

. African continuum based upon the

"e forces that are around us
 ~30 ,” Johnson said of his work.

“Life forces are a HUMAN thing. It
makes no difference that they come
from an African cycle. It is a
reflection of birth, joy, love and
death.” ' . .
Part of the spirit is a celebration of
heroes, and the Ensemble will
present three expressions of black
heroes: a tribute to Aretha Frank-
lin, a tribute to black baseball
greats, and a dance choreographed

and performed by Johnson honor-'

ing the late Dr. Martin Luther
King. ,

Partly funded by the National,

Endowment of the Arts and the

_ Gulf Oil Corporation, the Black

  

,;",§;‘>__b.qatre Ensemble has both junior

' .933’ senior companies and operates

  

the Afro-American Dance Theatre
as a school for all kinds of dance
from Afro-Haitian, modern and
African to ballet. In the past they

have danced for East Liberty’s
Selma Burke Arts Centers and for
the city's black community centers.

This summer the troupe will bring
its art to the streets as part of the
City’s Department of Parks and

Recreation community theatre pro-
gram.

“There’s a whole lot of people in
the streets -today,” says Johnson.
They’re human. They've got
problems, but we show them the
sun still shines and the water’s still
ﬂowing, and maybe their problems

will go away tomorrow.” 1

- Chilclsployz Not For Children Only

BY JESS M. BRALLIER
Theatre is a matter of coat and

ties, quiet auditoriums, smoky, hot ’

lobbies and stuffy, strange people

-from Broadway. Right? Well, not

really. But because of the distorted

theatre exposure so many Ameri-j

cans first encounter, this impres-
sion is, sadly, all -too common.
But for the past three years,
thanks to the efforts of students
and faculty from Pitt’s Theatre Arts
Division, the situation is taking a

_ change for the cultural good of the
' Pittsburgh community.

« Childsplay, Pitt’s touring Child-
'ren’s Theatre Company, considers
’its work to be much more than

simply presenting children’s stor-
ies to cute little kids. The com-
pany's work is, instead, a matter of
opening the doors of the theatre as
a cultural experience for the beneﬁt
of Pittsburgh children.

Dr. Gillette Elvgren, the com-
pany’s director, explains, “Today’s
children, or, more importantly to
me, this city’s children, are being

_ geared to passive forms of enter-

tainment such as television. All
they do is sit and watch, sit and

Pinky’s efforts to run a classy

for direction, writing, supporting

Its producer-director-writer Fran-

Art Carney, who played the

The Carney victory was a surprise

Isaac Stern’s appearance with the
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra
ast weekend was unusual and
teresting. Not only because
tern is "one of the greatest
‘.3;-éviolinists in the world (isn’t that
.-much?) but also because he
._e °1'med the world premiere of a
ommissioned violin concerto.
George Rochberg wrote most of
he Concerto for Violin and
__rchestra during the spring and
ummer of 1974. The piece was
commissioned for Stem by the
Iittsburgh Symphony in memory of
.;Donald Steinfirst (the late noted
music ‘critic of the Pittsburgh
.ost-Gazette‘) with several grants,
ncluding one from the Post
Gazette.
The style of the score is like that of
the romantic eighteenth century
period. The concerto has five
movements and each suggests
special themes and varying inter-
pretations. It is scored for a large
modern orchestra. Written es-
pecially for Stem, the concerto
takes his technique and style into
. account and is consequently more

Donald Johanos, the symphony did

few times it was albit loud, though
it was not clear whether Roch-
berg’s meaning included this
extreme volume level.

The Introduction began with a
violin solo sobbing a theme laden
with complex double stops.
Orchestral support consisted of
bold, sketchy tones, minor chords
and eerie brass. The entire
movement seemed flighty and
agitated until a brief momentof
tranquility at the end.

The ﬁrst Intermezzo saw Stern
plunging ahead with the same style
of orchestral accompaniment. At
one point, the strings played a
lively section con legno, which
seemed to spark Stern to new
heights of tremendous technique
and prestissimo double stops in an
involved cadenza. From the very
ﬁrst chord, there was a sense of
strong competition between the
soloist and the orchestra.

Fantasia unfolded a melancholy
elegy for a departed friend. Stern
had the movement under ‘his
command as the lovely, legato
tones blended with the fullness of
the orchestra. The second
Intermezzo contained the longest
solo section. _Stem outdid himself
in the lulling rhythms, and colorful
tones contrasted with the dream-

Isooc Stern GroceTsSympliony

like quality of the brass and muted
strings. _

Epilogue ventured into the world
of counterpointal styles with the
brass pitted against the string and
woodwind sections. Jolting chords
clashed with soft, melodic phrasing
in the violin cadenzas, until the
commotion died away in the last,
touching chords.

The ﬁrst part of the program
consisted of Schubert's Symphony
in B-flat Major, No. 5 and Ravel’s
Rapsodie espagnole.

Symphony No. 5 was a typically
brilliant piece written by a
19-year-old Schubert for a small
ensemble without timpani and
brass. In Allegro, the woodwinds
initiated and sustained a light
theme supported by the pp Jovial,
forceful chords of the strings.
Johanos did a marvelous job with
the dynamics in this movement.

Andante con moto sounded a
serene, quiet theme verging on a
Lieder-type expression. Menuetto
delivered dancing, regal tones with
recurrences of a previous theme
and lots of dialogue between the
sections. Allegro vivace followed a
lively rondo theme, but Johanos
held the reins with a heavy hand

"and did not let this movement get

Clowns with ‘Dell Pinky’

performers feel more free to pre-
sent their individual clowns.

Although it was humanly impos-
sible to maintain the fast pace of
their best moments, the clowns

. skillfully combined improvisation

with a prepared script. They got
laughs--and really exposed the
ridiculous aspects of restaurants
and sketchy theatre lectures and
demonstrations.

The company has successfully
developed consistent and memor-
able personalities. All the clowns
were talented and it’s unfair to
single anyone out, but Anne Fish-

'el’s (Pinky) mastery of the silent

laugh is remarkable. Commedia
Dell’Pinky has just begun to ex-
plore the potential these clown
characters have. -

At its finest, Commedia Dell’

Pinky approached the duality of the’

silent comedians the clowns ad-
mire. A phone rang during a talk
show parody. More surprisingly,
the hostess reached into the desk
drawer and answered it. Soon there
were five phones on the desk and
everyone was talking on the phone.

The Iowa Theatre Lab again will
perform on April 30 through May 4.
The last time the Lab was here,
their amazing performances forced
me to do more self-examination
thanxany other theatre even ,I’ve

innovative show. And so did the

what you’ve come to expect from

workshops. In the case of Circus
Machine, the children will paint
scenes of a circus, paste up
collages, and, in one case, they
even formed an orchestra. In this
way, when we perform, the child-
ren see their own creations and
efforts projected on-screen. And
then during the performance, the
kids will become lions, elephants
and ‘other circus animals. We
simply get them involved so that’
the children are on stage from
beginning to end.”

Elvgren believes that all too often
children are fed lackluster moral-
ities labled as ‘Children’s Theatre.’
In contrast, he points out that
Circus Machine is a play of dreams,
lies, truths, tears and laughter.”
Since our audiences range from
kindergarten children to sixth gra-
ders, our plays must be capable of
interpretation on levels ranging
from slapstick appreciation to
statements about morality. And
certainly, there’s something in my
productions for adults. ”

The mobility of Childsplay is an
important advantage. “Whether
it's in their schools, at community
functions, or PTA’s, the fact is that

we're a children’s theatre company
that goes to the children.” Elvgren
also stresses that, “The situation is
just too far out of hand to sit back
and wait for people to come to us;
instead we’re out in the community
working hand-in-hand with the

children.”

The theatre experience doesn’t
end with the play’s final act. The
children continue to discuss the
play and use it in relation to other
classwork months after the com-
pany has left the school.

Elvgren envisions a tremendous
growth possibility for the program.
“I’d like, of course, to be able to
play to more schools and especially
to more city schools. We also could
gear some of our work to documen-
tary plays that would investigate
the history of Pittsburgh and its
personalities. I certainly think that
the children of this city would
beneﬁt from a greater knowledge
of their environments’s history.”

The success makes sense. After
all, since theatre existed long
before coats and ties, fancy thea-
tres and Broadway, it seems that
its success is in reality ‘only a
matter of exposure.

Rapsodie espagnole made its
debut in Paris in 1908 as a
full-ﬂedged member of the Im-
pressionistic movement. Prelude a
la nuit began sedately as one ‘felt’
the night in the sounds’ of the
orchestra--in the form of clouds,
starlight, calm breezes and bloom-
ing flowers. Malaguena pictured
this sensual dance with quiet
pizzicato and muted trumpets
against a steady, ostinato bass
motif. The English horn cadenza
added to this ‘gypsy’ feeling with a
highly embellished melody.

Habanera awakened a more
seductive, mystical mood with an

oboe and English horn sequence,.

strings, tamborines andvcastanets.
The final movement, Feria, ex-
ploded in giant overtones replete
with excitement and bursting with
color. Ravel’s orchestration was
unquestionably brilliant here and
his Spanish-French influence
brought out music of the mind and
the senses. Conviction and
intensity were never lacking, as
control was exercised over the
range of orchestration.
and beauty manifested an ingen-
uous style hard to equal.

_“T(_) use an old cliche, it was a long

1,8-3-1 squad of the 1973-74 season.

problem would be a lack of depth.

favorite target--tight end Dan

The quarterbacking slot will'give
Paterno the most trouble; the front
runner so far is John Andress, a
junior.

Another junior and a former
teammate of Andress at Greens-

last year. Taylor should step in as
the main man this season.

Behind Taylor will be freshman

called the ‘Kid Line.’ '
Freshmen Bill Gedeon and Chuck

Crisanti and sophomore Jeff Saun-

the team something on which to

added 44 goals for the Panthers,
many in crucial situations.
Sophomore Vernon had another
fantastic campaign, with 56 goals
and 32 assists for 88 points. The
Panther right winger has tallied a
total of 109 goals in his two years at
Pitt, giving nightmares to enemy
goalies with his powerful slapshot.

Vernon averaged 2.5 goals per
game this season.

Seniors Hagins and Browne ended
their -collegiate ‘careers on high
notes. Captain Hagins contributed
17 goals, but was known more for

Another surprise came from Val

The Lions will have a fair amount
of experience in the defensive
secondary, with safety Mike John-

starter Jeff Hite, who will be at the
other corner spot.

Soccer-style kicker Chris Bahr will
be back to handle the place-kicking

different story, as Brian Masella
has gone on to bigger and better
things. _

This year State will play a
somewhat difficult schedule. It
includes Stanford, West Virginia,
Maryland, North Carolina State

of all is the Lions’ second game of
the season, when they will travel to

Bye-Bye, Melvin

BY ANDY BEHREND
Associate Sports Editor

For a 20-year old kid who’s about to.become, well, if not ﬁlthy rich,
then certainly grubby rich, Melvin, Bennett doesn’t sound too=happy.

Assigning plans are being completed (Mel is now visiting lovely.
Virginia), Bennett ‘still is sticking to his policy of “no comments,”
which is said not nastily, just forcefully. Perhaps he’s a bit weary of
some of the negative feedback people have been tossing his way. Or
maybe he’s simply confused--not an illogical state of mind considering

what he’s going through.

In any case, Melvin’ Bennett most assuredly is not guilty of any
sinister deed should he pull off this major coup.

Personally, I’m kelly' green with envy of Bennett’s precarious
situation. ‘Imagine trying to decide between $650,000 or math’
homework and English papers. Besides, $650,000 can buy a lot of Big

Macs.

Realistically then, no one "with his bean screwed on tightly can find
fault with Melvin B.’s decision to jump to the Virginia Squires of the
American Basketball Association. If that well-publicized price tag is
accurate, Bennett will reap heaps of green--over $100,000 a ‘year for

five years. ‘

That’s a little bit more than he’s be making while doing ‘his stuff for.

Pitt .

And remember, Melvin Bennett owes the University of Pittsburgh.
absolutely nothing. If anything, the school can thank its lucky stars
« that he graced the Field House’s warped ﬂoor boards for as long as he
did. It is safe to say Buzz Ri‘dl’s last squad would have been merely
average had not Bennett been in the middle,-‘slyly waiting to block the

‘ shot of some poor, unsuspecting soul: --
Much fame also awaits Bennett, as she would become the first
freshman--and’ the second youngest. player ever--to jump, joining

‘ iMoses Malone in the Promised Land “of happy hoopers.

But there are some nagging factors involved. _
- Like, Bennett just may not be ready for the pros. Sure, he was the
best 6-7 freshman center in the country, but that ain’t nothin’ to pros.
Surely, Bennett will have to learn the forward position. Virginia must
be totally gone on him if it thinks he’ll be ready to compete with ABA

forwards .

Despite its ineptness in some areas, the ABA has exceptional

forwards. ‘

And,'hustler though he is,;B,ennett is going to ﬁnd himself outquicked
by a‘ number of theselforwards. ~When he was the center, he could
stand stationary and then--LEA'P! Now he’ll be taken away from that

' lofty position and thrust into the corner; it has not yet been proven he
can handle that area with the same dominance he did at center.

Offensively, we've witnessed a plethora of moves by the immensely
talented Peabody grad. However, the touch’ doesn’t always accompany
Bennett’s dexterity.~__ Furthermore, the outsidefshot, a must for a
forward,- was not- at part of his repertoire this past season.

So, Melvin Bennett must contend with superior forwards,
inexperience (one .freshman year does not a career make) and the
Squires themselves, one of the shakier -ABA franchises.

All we have to contend with are the damned pros, who scoop up
anyone, anytime‘, regardless of whether he’s ready or not. That, and a
dominating center. If Bennett goes, I hope he makes himself worth it.

Luck, Mel.

same; so they are considered the
team with the fourth highest point
total.

Series “C” matches the Pitts-
burgh Penguins (89) with the St.
Louis Blues (84). The Pens had the
third highest point total, not count-
ing the divisional leaders. Pitts-
burgh, however, finished sixth

over-all, three points higher than

Vancouver with 86.

The teams with the higher point
totals have home-ice advantage.
Pittsburgh, Los Angeles, Boston
and the Rangers played at home
last night. Thursday night, they’ll
play on their opponents’ ice. If a
third game is needed to decide the
best-of-three series, the ice ad-
vantage will be switched again.

The second round will begin
Sunday with four best—of-seven,
series. In the quarter-ﬁnals, the
four winners of the first-round
series will play the division win-
ners. The pairings, again, are
based on the season point totals;

featuring

 

most against fewest, and so forth.

The semi-finals, also best-of-
seven, will have the four-quarter
final winners participating. The
team with the most points will play
the team with the least points, and
the team with the second highest
point total will play the team with
the third highest. ‘

The ﬁnals will pit the two

semi-ﬁnal winners in a best-of-I

seven series. It would seem logical
for the division winners to meet at
some point in the playoffs. Since
Philadelphia, Buffalo and Montreal
each had 113 points, wins will
determine home-ice advantage.
The Flyers had 51 wins, the Sabres
had 49 and the Canadiens, 47.
Confusingly enough, if the top
teams in the first round won,
Pittsburgh would play Montreal.

But if either Boston or Los Angeles ”

were upset, the Pens would play
the remaining winner. And if both
Boston and Los Angeles lost, the
Penguins would play the winner of
the New York series, with Pitts-

 

burgh having home-ice advantage.

In case you’re wondering if a
tie will upset the schedule, don’t.
The playoffs have sudden-death
overtime. In the event of a tie after
three periods of regular play, a
15-minute intermission will pre-
cede an ‘overtime period of 20
minutes [the same as a regular
period]. The first team to score
wins the game. lfino one scores,
another period follows another

‘ intermission.

By now, you’re probably aware
that a lot of “if’s" go into the
Stanley Cup playoffs. Last year,
Philadelphia won the Cup, defeat-
ing Boston four games to two in the
final round.

This year the Flyers finished
with the best record in the league,
51-18-11. But only eight points
separate the teams ranked third
through eighth in the first round.
Enough upstarts have snuck into
the playoffs to make things uncom-

fortable for the division leaders.

   iNEWS'—-Wednesday,  9, '1 975

 ebster’s Charges Loaded With Talent

had trouble getting warmed up, as
the temperature hovered near 40
degrees.

“It was a cold day and I was tight
at the start of the match,” said
Dieffenbach, one of three Panthers
from Williamsport. “I kept playing
to his backhand, which was pretty
weak, and in thesecond and third
sets I found my serve and started
going to the net.

“In the ﬁrst set, I had been
rushing my backhand and I was
slow on my feet, but my mental
attitude is good and I was able to
settle myself and play my game,
not his,” Dieffenbach said.

Joe Kantor has handled the
number-one spot. capably for the
past three years, and nothing has

 
  
     
  
   
  
   
   
  
   
  
 

changed. A graduate of Carnegie
High School near Pittsburgh,
Kantor finished second in the
WPIAL singles tournament his
senior year at Carnegie; at Pitt he’s
compiled a 24-11 career record, and
is 2-0 this year.

Kantor’s game is primarily
offensive, with strong ground
strokes and an aggressive net
game; he eats up his opponents the
way an Oldsmobile eats up
gasoline.

Tom Current holds down the
number-two position for coach Fran
Webster’s squad--as he did last
year--and plays as aggressive a
game as Kantor. The Oil City High
graduate has a career record of
25-10 and has played an integral

part in bringing winning tennis to
Pitt. He is ranked 18th in men’s
singles in Western Pennsylvania.

The number-four seed on this
year’s Panther team is sophomore
Mike Habbel, who last year
compiled a 7-4 record. Habbel has
breezed through his two matches
thus far, losing only three games
last season.

“So far the guys I’ve played,”
Habbel said, “just haven’t played

“I’ve been playing long enough
and have as much experience as
the guys I’m playing against,”
Habbel said. \

Mike's brother Harry has joined
him in the singles lineup this year,
playing in the number five
positions. He has won both his
matches soifar, using the same
baseline consistency as his brother.

The number-six singles spot has
not yet been decided, with Gary
Mosso, a letterman from last year,
Dave Wulkan, and newcomers
Scott Luther and Senior battling for
the position.

All three doubles teams are of
nearly equal ability, with Kantor-
Current playing number one and
Dieffenbach-M. Habbel. number
two. .

The third doubles team consists of

so, according to

Harry Habbel and any one of the,

four men vying for the sixth

position.

The Panthers’ match today is an
extremely crucial one: West
Virginia is the foe andthe match
begins at 2 pm at the Trees Hall
courts. The Mountaineers de-
feated Pitt last year by a score of
8-1, but this time Pitt will have the.
home-court advantage.

“This match could be the turning
point of our season," said
Dieffenbach. “A win over a tough
team like West Virginia .would be a
real boost to our conﬁdence and

‘ could possibly make our season.

The key to our winning the match

as the Indians’ designated hitter,
came to bat before an enthusiastic
crowd of about 45,000 in the bottom
of the first inning. There was no
score and the crowd was barely
settled back from a 30-minute,
pregame ceremony marking the
occasion.

Robinson worked Yankee pitcher
Doc Medich to a 2-2 count, fouling
off three pitches, before hitting the
homer.
roared, Robinson tipped his cap as
he crossed home plate. The first
player out of the Cleveland dugout
to meet him was starting pitcher
Gaylord Perry, with whom Robin-
son has had differences.

Perry, the winning pitcher in his
tenth consecutive opening day
assignment, settled down and went
the distance’ after the Yankees
jumped to a 3-1 lead in the second
inning. He was helped immensely
by the booming bat of Boog Powell,
the former Baltimore ﬁrst baseman
Robinson now is teamed with
again.

The Yankees made their only dent
on Perry when Ron Blomberg and
Graig Nettles singled to open the
second. Chris Chambliss doubled
them home and then scored on
Thurman Munson’s single.

As the partisan crowd

The Indians cut that lead to 3-2 in
their half of the second when
Powell, who had singled — and
moved around to third, scored on a
sacriﬁce fly by Jack Brohamer.

Powell had three hits, and his
second one was a long home run
over the centerfield fence in the
fourth inning that tied the game
3-3. Then Powell sent the Indians
ahead in the sixth inning when he
doubled to the right ﬁeld corner,
scoring George Hendrick.

Powell moved to third on a
fielder’s choice and scored on

Brohamer’s single, giving the
Indians a 5-3 lead.
Robinson batted three other

times. He grounded out to third,
lined deep to Piniella in left and
walked.

. . He went to’ the mound only once,

in the ninth inning after Chambliss
had ﬂied deep to right for the

second out. The Yankees had one
man on base.
Then, Perry, with the crowd

standing and roaring on every
pitch, worked Munson to a 1-2
count before forcing him to ground
back to the pitcher for the ﬁnal out
of the game.

BOB JOHNSON and

The crowd roared again, and
Robinson congratulated his win-
ning pitcher and sometime adver-
sary.

Three marching bands and an
Army color guard were on hand for
the pre-game, ceremony which was
hosted by former Cleveland pitcher
Jim “Mudca_t" Grant.

Among the baseball celebrities on
hand were Commissioner Bowie
Kuhn and American League
President Lee MacPhail. Kuhn
was introduced and received a loud
round of boos. “We’re here for an
historic day in baseball,” he said.

“And I would like to extend a
warm welcome and ‘congratulate
the Cleveland baseball club."

As if this were a World Series
game rather than a season opener,
the entire squads of both" the
Indians and the Yankees were
introduced individually, lining up
along the foul lines. ‘
