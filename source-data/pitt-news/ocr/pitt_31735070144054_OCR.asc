Pittsburgh City Council unar1i—
mously voted to quadruple the ﬁne for
violating the cityfs open container law
yesterday,  the penalty from $50
to $200 for a first offense

City Council now must vote 
to ﬁnalize the change, which could oc-

cur as early as next week’s meeting

Zone 4 Police Commander Kathy
Degler told the Pittsburgh Post—Ga—
zette that her zone — which includes
Oakland —— has issued at least 107
open container citations in the past
year;

“Oakland is our highest place
where this hap ” she told the Post-
Gazette. “There seems to be an abso-
lute negiect of the lawin Oakland with
respect to the open container law

“The quality of life of the people
who live in Oakland is vastly chal-
lenged by this cavalier behavior,” she
said. _

In the same vote, the city raised
the penalty for a second offense from
$100 to $300.

.The costofathirdoffensewillre 0

main at $500. Also, the violations no

longer need to occur within a one—year_

period to count as multiple offenses

Councilrnan- Bill Peduto told the
Post-Gazette that the current ﬁnes
aren’t enough to deter the‘ college stu-
dents who drink in public.

“Fifty bucks, you can go to the
ATM and get that out,” he said “Two
hundred bucks you’re probably

According to the law, “No person
shall consume alcoholic beverages or
carry or possess an open container of
alcoholic  in the public right-
of—way, or on private property without
the consent of the landowner or ten-
ant”

The only exceptions to the op'en
container policy are block parties that

Exhibit tells tale of Pittsburgh slaves

by J oharma Ojo
For T /are Pitt New

Just because Pittsburgh is north
of the Mason-Dixon Line doesn’t
meanthat the city was free of slavery
in the 18th and 19th centuries, ac-
cording to a new exhibit that opened
this weekend.

“Even though I’m not from Pitts-

burgh, I didn’t imagine that slavery

was this bad in Pittsburgh,” said Pitt ‘

sophomore Tyler Summers
The exhibit, titled “Free at Last?

Slavery in Pittsburgh in the 18th and
19th Centuries,” opened at the Sena-
torjohn Heinz History Center in the
Strip District on Saturday.

In 1800 the population of Pitts-
burgh was around 2,400 people,
with 64 of them  slaves, and
some free black people. Even though
Pittsburgh hosted slavery, it was still
accepting toward free black people,
according to the exhibit

“Going to the exhibit brought
slavery closer to home, because I saw
the names and the inhumanity be-

hind slavery,” said Summers

In 2007, an employee for the Al-
legheny County recorder of deeds
found papers about indentured ser-
vants and about slaveholders buying
and selling their slaves These papers
were then given to Vice Chancellor
Robert Hill Beforepthat time, Hill
said he was unaware of slavery in
Pittsburgh

This year is the 200th anniver-
sary of the Abolition of Slavery Act,
which abolished the slave trade in the

United Kingdom.

“We are currently celebrating the
250 year celebration [of Pittsburgh’s
founding], but we don’t celebrate this
aspect of our history even though it
affects our quality of life today,” said
Hill.

This exhibit was designed to tell

a larger story. Itis about how the rise 1

of a nation coincided with the rise of
slavery and how Pennsylvania strug-
gled with this It gives the public an
insight into information previously
unknown about life in Pittsburgh,
said Hill.

 Talking trash
Pittsburgh implements simpliﬁed
W recycling, but it's not enough

The city of Pittsburgh is tak-
? ing action to “redd up” the city
 and make recycling easier for
 residents.

Mayor Luke Ravenstahl’s ad-
 ministration announced Tuesday
 that it is no longer necessary for
 residents to sort their recyclables
lby material. All recyclables —
 from bottles and cans to newspa-
 pers — can be placed in the same
 blue bag. Cardboard is the only
 item that will need to be sepa-
l rated. The citywide endeavor will
 ofﬁcially begin Nov. 3.

 When the city implemented
 the simpliﬁed recycling pilot
 program in Pittsburgh’s central,
 Downtown and eastern neigh-
 borhoods earlier this year, almost
 10 percent more households
 began recycling, the Pittsburgh
l Post-Gazette reported.

l “With help from the city,
 we’ve implemented an extremely
 successful recycling program.
Everything from cooking oil to
cardboard is being recycled. And
with-Steelers fans now recycling
in the stadium, we are now the
 black, gold and green city,” said
 Ravenstahl, according to WPXI
‘ news.

We applaud the city’s decision
to make the recycling process
easier. The move will not only

 make Pittsburgh a more envi-
Q ronmentally friendly city but will
 also beneﬁt the city ﬁnancially.
The city government receives
$46.46 for every ton Pittsburgh
recycles. Furthermore, the city
will save hundreds of thousands
of dollars through reduced land-
ﬁll fees, according to the Post-

Gazette.

For many Pittsburghers who
ﬁnd it difﬁcult to recycle, this
news comes as a relief. With an
easier system, there will be no ex-
cuse for residents not to recycle.

But, in a way, the citywide ini-
tiative is an incomplete solution.
Part of the reason why people
do not recycle is because they do
not understand the rules that go
along with it.

The misconceptions
countless. Is it OK to recycle pa-
per with staples? Can bottles that
contain liquid be recycled? Can
labels be left on plastic items?
The answer to all the aforemen-
tioned questions is yes, but it is
precisely questions like these
that -might be preventing many
people from taking the initiative
to recycle. For some, recycling is
confusing and simply too much
work.

_ For this reason, the city has
an obligation to educate its resi-

ZIC

dents about what recycling does 5

and does not entail. Residents
should be made aware that recy-
cling is not as difﬁcult as it may

ronmental to ﬁnancial gains.

Save humanity, design your baby

A clean—cut, educated couple
sits down for an interview. They
do not want any children right
now, they explain, because the ca-
reer comes ﬁrst in order to best
provide for a family when the right
time does come. Next time they
are interviewed, they say having

 kids would be nice, but that now

is not the right market in which to

 start a family. When they are ﬁnally
seem. Pittsburghers should also 
be informed of the beneﬁts that 
come with recycling, from envi— 

agement page already do a good 
job of this, but it’s not enough.

make a broader effort to reach 3

out to their constituents, inform
them of the beneﬁts of recycling

ready for children, it turns out they
missed their biological window of
opportunity, and both blame each
other for their failed reproductive
outcome.

Meanwhile, the quotidian teen-
age mom in the trailer park down
the road has collected about a half-
dozen little rugrats without much
in the way of planning. Those ru-
grats beget more rugrats, whose

clans grow exponentially while
. passing on their conventional ways

from one generation to the next.

' In the end, the world is overrun

by multitudes like this, while the
ﬁscally responsible couple never
ends up reproducing once.

This is the scenario from the
2006 ﬁlm “Idiocracy,” in which
the eventual dumbing down of
the populous leaves the world
ﬁlled with modern cavemen —— no

offense —— unable to make much
progress as a society. It’s an actual
concept of study —— the “demo-
graphic-econornic paradox.” Sheer
numbers overpower the efﬁciency
of selective evolution. ‘

Dysgenics — the “dilution” of
quality genetic material — is then
supposed to eventually lead to a
slowdown in human progress. I
believe it was George Carlin who
said in one of his last standup
comedy routines, “No Child Left
Behind. Oh, really? It wasn’t too
long ago you were talking about
giving children a head start. Head
start —— left behind, someone’s
losing ground here.”

And looking around, particu-
larly in my bathroom vanity, has
led me to believe dysgenics is‘ in-
evitable.

So how does one counter this
genetic free-fall? At present, I see
three options: negative eugenics,
Chinese birth control or positive
eugenics —— Robert Klark Graham-
style. Since forced sterilizations in
the early 20th century proved to
be an immoral and plainly just
bad idea and because adopting any
policies from communist China
will never be an option, our only.
hope is to start utilizing positive
eugenics to takeour gene pools in
a progressive direction. Designer
babies, here I come.

Personally, I cannot wait to re-

produce a handpicked, top-of-the-
line mutant cyborg baby and call
him my own. The more superpow-
ers, the better. He will have 20/20
infrared binocular, no —- trinocu—

and the nose of a Bloodhound.
Forget college funds, it’s time to
start saving for your future child’s
genetic modiﬁcations. _

It is a more comprehensive in-
vestment than college: You start
off with a rad, Terminator—like
infant that is physically incapable
of crying, with 250 terabytes of
memory and the necessary critical
assessment skills to ace the LSATS
by age 5. Teach him a few good
manners, and that small gene mod
investment you initially made turns
into a full ride to Oxford. Come
up with an inventive name for him
— let’s_go with Sirius Lee —— and
you now have the ﬁrst majorstep
in your gene line’s advance toward
post-humanism.

Some skeptics out there don’t
seem to realize this is the only way
to save our country, maybe even
humanity as a whole, from degen-
erating into a mass of sheep that
ﬁghts ﬁre with gasoline. Guys like
Bruce, my guest columnist this
week, tend to ask too many ques-
tions, delaying my plans for Lee’s
augmentations. But in the tradi-
tion of fairness, I’ll give Bruce his
shake. Go ahead, buddy.

With polystyrene plates, you are What you eat on

by Matthew Diabes
Colum/z1L1t

Paranoid about  the infa-
mous “ﬁreshman 15,” I committed
myself to attempting to live a healthier
lifestyle, and therefore most of the
things crossingimy mind as possible
sweet treats at lunch today were out
of the question. Then, I remembered
heating that there was a frozen yogurt
place at the Schenley Cafe in the W711-
liam Pitt Union. Contemplating what
I would get, I headed over to it —

‘Freshens — and when I got there, I

stopped, horriﬁed To my great dis-
may, towering before me stood a pillar
of ignorance, an obelisk of ineptitude,
a cathedral of the unleamed: a great
big stack of Styrofoam cups.

I was disconcerted when I found
out that the University only recycles
plastics No. 1 and No. 2 when the
city of Pittsburgh itself recycles No. 1
through No. 5. I was disappointed to
see stacks of unused plastic plates next

Gene modiﬁcation
solution to stupidity

Bruce: Thanks, Brandon. I
wanted to raise some concerns
about positive eugenics, as I believe
allowing for such a development
opens up more questions than it
provides solutions. What happens
if gene modiﬁcations become so
popular that everyone is average in
relation to one another?

What if those who were born
with modiﬁcations begin to re-

osity? Are these not traits that help

LettertotheEditor

Dear Editor,

The Tuesday, Oct. 28, issue of The Pitt News contained an article, “Jobs Plentiful in Nuclear Power.”
I would ask everyone to research what the nuclear industry is doing regarding the disposal of nuclear
waste. I agree that “we need to educate the public on what our real [energy] choices are.”

CNBC recently did a documentary on the nuclear issue: storage at Yucca Mountain, the French re-
cycling solution, etc. Please take a look at it and ask yourself how long can waste be safely stored? What
other solutions are there? What is phytoremediation? What is vitriﬁcation?

Ask questions of the Citizens Action Coalition and look online to see what people of Nevada are cur-

rently doing regarding licensing of Yucca Mountain.

What does our governor think about transport of nuclear waste through Pennsylvania?
Look at the costs involved and please research the Hanford site  one of many nuclear sacriﬁce areas.

Look at the record of thyroid cancers, etc. in the area.

Take a hard look at the powerful companies in this industry and then ask yourself if this is where you

want to work.

It’s that time of the year 

The pigskin has been inﬂated, the
water bottles have been ﬁlled, and
both teams have ﬁnished their pre-
game warm-ups

No, Pitt isn’t playing West Vir-
ginia. It’s intramurals.

For yet another year, more than
800 Pitt students will march their way
to the Cost Sports Center and par-
ticipate in an activity as old as Panther
athletics itself.

Intramural football is already deep
into its season, and students agree it’s
a great source of entertainment

“It couldn’t be better,” said Sweet
Mitts team member Adam Fasullo.

“It’s something fun to do. It keeps
us off the streets, out of trouble,”

said participant Jonathan Graziano,

with a smile

Pitt draws with mighty UConn

by Ben Duignan
Staff Wrder

Pitt 2, Connecticut 2

Tuesday night’s game against Con-
necticut might have been the most
disappointing tie for the mer1’s soccer
teaminrecent memory.

If before kickoff the Panthers
were told they would tie the No
15-ranked Huskies, there probably
wouldn’t have been much disappoint-

ment among the team to get one -

point from the contest;

The reaction may have 
however,iftheteamknewitwas
13 seconds away from getting two
points

The Panthers took a 1-0 advan-
tage in the 25th minute when junior
midﬁelder Mike McDade put the ball
in the net on an indirect kick from
25 yards out. Redshirt freshman de-

fender Sam Luffy and senior forward
  provided the assists

5 on the play.

Pitt held on to the lead until eady
in the second half, when Connecticut
sophomore rnidﬁelderjoe Boa found
the lower left comer of the net on a
pass from midﬁelder Tony Cascio.

The last three minutes of the game
saw as much scoring as the ﬁrst 87.

\X/1th just more than two minutes
remaining in the contest, McCormick
registered his second assist of the
night when he crossed the ball to the
middle of the penalty box and sopho-
more midﬁelder Ian Farnsworth one-
timed the ball into the back of the
goal

Just as it looked like the Panthers
would pull off a huge upset over the
Huskies, Connecticut freshman Toni
Stahl launched a 30-yard strike that
found the lower left corner of the
goal with 13 seconds left in the con-

test. The assist was provided by Cas-
cio, his second of the game

Both teams did not score in two
overtime  and the game end-
ed in a 2-2 tie '

Even though Pitt was outshot 19-
11 inthegame,itregisteredtwomore
shots on goal than the Huskies.

The tie moved Pitt’s. record to
76-3 overall, and 3-5-2 in Big East
play-

“The last goal was devastating,”
said Pitt coach Joe Luxbacher. “It
wasn’t a fluke though. Toni Stahl is
a great player and he hit a great shot
from 30 yards out”

Evenwiththetie,theteamis still
in good position to make the Big East
tournament.

Theteamwillplayits ﬁnalgame
of the season Nov 1 against Provi-
dence and will lock up a postseason
berth with a win

all over coming to Pitt that played‘

sports in  school but didn’t go
on to play in coll ” said intramu-
rals veteran Chris Hartland “I think
intramurals is a great way to keep ac-
tive”

' With more than a dozen time slots
available, divisions are open for even
the busiest of students. Intramural
games typically run Monday through
Thursday from 8:30 to 11:30 pm,
as well as Sunday from-4 pm to 10
pm, according to intramural sports
coordinator William Wallace.

“Sometimes we aren’t done until
1 o’clock in the morning,” said intra-
mural co—director  Ross.

Differing from the NFL on more
than the average playefs 40-yard dash
time, intramural football is played
with one-hand touch, six on six. In
addition, the sport is run on a smaller,
8(,)-by-35-yard ﬁeld demarcated into
four zones  the ball into a
new zone results in a ﬁrst down.

For a complete set of guidelines,
the intramural handbook is available
at the Intramural and Recreation Of-
ﬁce at the Petersen Events Center.

 

Different time slots divide into
separate leagues consisting of six
to eight teams on average. After six
weeks of intramural action starting
in late September, the top two teams
advance into the playoffs in most

during crunch-time, but every Pitt
student has the opportunity to play
in a league. There are divisions for
fraternities as well as women. Stu-
dents can register a team with friends
or register as an unattached player for

leagues. placement on a team. ~

“[Signups were] very easy,” said
participant Taylor Will.

Intramurals are also an outlet to
enjoy college without  a sav-
ings account.

“All intramurals are free for stu-
dents,” said Ross. C

“I think it [being free] is awe-
some,” said Will “If it were like 20

’ also creates team fan bases, especially

"This team is playing with con-

Whﬂe there were mixed emotions
from the players and coaches after the
game, Luxbacher said his team must
focus on its last game of the season
against Providence . _ .

“The team’s mentality right now is
that we have to go to Providence and

less celebrated  back named Steve Slaton
eventually swallowed him up Gwaltncy left WVU
bﬁcfly and attempted a comeback that didn’t work
out. Gwaltney was gone and forgotten.

Never mind howl stumbled upon his name,
but it was certainly by mistake. It was like 
Lenny Cooke’s name on a random CBA score
sheet; It makes you wonder what happened and
what could have been.

Regardless, turns out Gwaltney isn’t doing too
poorly in the PSAC West — you’d certainly hope
not — with 709 yards and 10 touchdowns in ﬁve
games

So in the name of Gwaltney, here the other
whereabouts of some notable—yet—forgotten
names in Pitt and local football:

bit of fullback with Pitt before transferring to IUP
Has 254 yards in four games played this season

ing rushcr in 2005, transferred to Liberty
for mostly  reasons and won the Big South’s
Offensive Player of the Year award as a junior last
season. Has 1,000 yards and 11 touchdowns this
year

Marcel Pestano, California, Pa. —— Speedster
went to Pitt, got buﬁcd in the depth chart and
transferred to Ca], where he has 712 yards and
nine scores in nine games, catching passes ﬁom
