The Pitt News, Monday, October 29, 1984?

The changing face of SGB

By Glen Armodda
The Pitt News

For a long time, student govern-

ment elections have mirrored the‘

opinions of Pitt’s students. At the
same time, they have developed a
personality and history unique unto
themselves. Some elections have
been serious, contemplative and
moody while others have been rau-

cous and filled with controversy and

scandal. Then, there have been elec-
tions that were practically nonexist-
ent. A journey down the pot-holed
road called Memory Lane will give
today's student an idea of what past
elections were like. --

The late 1940s was one of those
obscure periods in American history
when nothing seemed to be happen-
ing. Not so on Pitt’s,campus; not so

for Ray Maher, Student Congress

representative.

Maher was one of five representa-

tives holding a seat in Student Con-
gress as the result of an invalid
election procedure. Maher and his

_cronies, referred to as the “Filthy

Five,“ had received enough votes
from students in the School of Phar-
macy to be elected to their seats. The
problem was that, according to Con-
gress’ constitution, pharmacy school
students were prohibited from vot-
ing in elections.

In November ‘of 1949, seven
months after his election, Maher
“dropped the political bombshell,”
as he put it, and stated he had been

aware of the unconstitutional voting»

since the election .the previous
spring, When asked why he had
waited so long to reveal his secret, he
said he was -“waiting for the right
psychological moment to spring it.”

Apparently, the’ “Filthy Five”
were trying ta gain control of the
congress and," as a result, student
government affairs. What Maher
lacked in ethics he _made up for in
smarts. “I would have called for a
reelection earlier in the year," he was

' quoted, “if I were certain of being

seated again.” The congress was

“forced to choose between recogniz-

ing the “Five” or calling for a new

election.

Toward the end of the 1950s, one
could see thebeginnings of campus
student unrest — if one looked hard
enough.

The big issue at Pitt in '59 was the
dress code, especially its application
to women on campus. A hot topic
time and again throughout the year,

it-came to a head at a Student,

Government Association meeting
on Oct. 10. Mindy Berman, sopho-
more rep to SGA, told the members
at the meeting that she was receiving
a lot of complaints about the code’s

prohibition of slacks for women on .

campus.

“Why can Bermuda shorts be
worn at appropriate times in
appropriate places and not slacks?”
she asked. President of AWS and

' acting Housing Board delegate Ann

Pongrantz replied. “The Housing
Board feels that s-lacks are much
more revealing than Bermuda
shorts."

Richard Zionts, senate represent-
ative to'SGA, suggested that campus

dress regulations should be better
publicized and summed up the situa-
tion's gravity for the meeting:
“Freshman girls have asked me if
there was a regulation that prohib-
ited lounging at a certain angle on
campus lawns during the warm
months. This situation shouldn’t
exist.” A

With such a hot issue at hand, one
would think that students would be
crawling over each other to get to the
polls. The election for three SGA
positions and 24 class cabinets drew
a whopping turnout of 766. Dave
Menzer, the polling chairman, noted
that it was “a rather apathetic
turnout.” ' .

The apathy of the ’50s’ students at
Pitt switched from the voters to the
candidates. In the SGA election of
1964, students had a rather narrow

field of candidates to choose from..

How narrow? One, to be exact. John
Vrana ran for president, Ron Cim—
ino for the vice president. Vrana
won the election by a 7 to 1 margin
over his write-in competitor.

The time is early January. The

The Pitt News, Monday, October 29,1984 

year is 1968. California’s governor
Ronald Reagan, is speaking at the
Syria Mosque on LB.l’s snowballing
welfare program. In a hip and
Dylanesque speech, he stated,
“There is a wind of change blowing
over the land. People want the free-
dom that is theirs by divine right, not
by government whim.”

Four months later, it is election
time on the Pitt campus, featuring a
three-party race. The big debate: the
structure of the newly formed stu-
dent government.

It seemed that the student body
had. something worthgetting out
and voting for. George Doperak,
presidential candidate for the
U.S.A. party, and Ken Schueler, the

candidate for the Positive Action.

Team, were slugging it out over such
hot items as discounts at the book-
store and improved housing condi-
tions in the dorms.

The U.S..A. platform included
pledges to produce and maintain a
year-round interest in ' student

government by creating permanent
political parties on campus and to
bolster educational opportunities

for undergraduates by opening up
classrooms and lecture halls to
become all-night study areas during
mid-terms and finals.

Schueler proposed a thorough
evaluation and revision of the class
registration process and recognition
of the Commuter Association as a
major student organization and
hoped to urge the university to pro-
vide a more cosmopolitan atmos-
phere for students to provide a more
enriching experience for
undergraduates.

Enter Armand Belly, president of
the William Pitt Debate Union, a
William Pitt Scholar and political
science major. Running as an inde-
pendent for president with his run-
ning mate Ken Holecko, Armand
Belly presented his platform to the
student body. In a statement at a
debate between the candidates aired
over the campus radio station
(WPGH), Belly proclaimed, “Stu-
dent government has been a farce, a

-waste of time, energy and money. It

serves no conceiveable function on
campus and tends to divert student
attention from the real problems

facing them." His solution turned
out to be his platform. “Student
government should be completely
abolished.”

Belly suggested that the essential
functions of student government be
transferred to other student organi-
zations and stated that the other
opponents had nothing to offer but
complete incompetency and
mediocrity.‘ ‘ ‘

What followed was a campaign of
smears and accusations, heated
debate and a scandal of sorts. Belly
had to drop his running mate,
Holecko, because of an eligibility
technicality that was brought to the
attention’ of election committee
chariman Ken Frederick. Mr. Belly
charged that Frederick, who was
also the current student government
president, had planned to use the
technicality as an excuse to keep him
off the ballot. Frederick responded

‘ that the eligibility question was
raised by one of Belly‘s opponents.
The plot thickened. Doperak
refused to comment on the situation
while Schueler claimed that he
didn’t initiate the “probe.”

Not to be outfoxed, Belly took on
Joe Kociubes as his new running
mate and jumped back into the ring,

Blast from the past - SGB elections revisited

charging his oppenents with empty
platforms and mediocrity. Schueler
criticized Belly, saying, “Armand is
treating the effect and not the cause
of the problems  he should leave
education to‘ the faculty and keep
control of extracurricular activities
in the students’ hands."

Doperak criticized Belly for hav-
ing the wrong attitude toward stu-
dent government, its problems and
labeled his proposal as “ridiculous.”
“We may be mediocre," he added,
“but at least we're sincere.”

One editorial in The Pitt News
questioned whether Belly could
accomplish the abolition of student
government since he didn't have a
slate of senators committed to him.
With that in mind, the paper asked,
how could Belly be assured of any
support from the senators in his
efforts?

The voter turnout: a total of 2,500 O

students cast their vote, which
represented about 35 percent of the
undergraduate enrollment. Their
choice for president was Ken
Schueler, the PAT candidate.
Schueler managed to beat out Belly
by 46 votes, the closest margin of
victorv to date in student govern-
commued on page ﬁve

Endorsements

The Editorial board of The Pitt News spent the last few
weeks interviewing the fourteen, candidates running for
Student Government Board positions, questioning them

on their qualifications and plans if elected. It is our
opinion that those candidates best suited to serve on the .

board are those who have a clear understanding of the
individual students in the university.

Our endorsement criteria centered on both previous
board-related experience and the candidate’s ability to
recognize the issues of concern to the average Pitt
student. - ~

We endorse Robert Kramer for Student Government»

Board president. His experience on the past board has
given Kramer the insight into what can be feasibly
accomplished this year. We believe his success in imple-
menting the Freshman Council is indicative of his com-
mitment to the SGB and his ability to lead and organize.
Candidate Lisa Douds expressed a concern for the
communication breakdown between the Pitt student
body and the SGB. A commitment to mandatory liasons
is a major plank in Doud’s platform. She would also like
tosee this commitment enforced. The formulation of a
student-faculty forum and the formation of the United
Council of Student Senate Seats are both realistic and
viable solutions to the communications problem.

Opening the channels to student government is the »

primary concern of candidate James Mumma. _We feel
SGB lacks student input, and Mumma intends to address
this crucial issue. Mumma proposes textbook pricing

reform, a concern of many budget-conscious Pitt

students.

Peter Petropoulos would bring his experience on the '

allocations committee to SGB. Student awareness and
participation in student government is an asset, one
Petropoulos would contribute if elected. T/his candidate
exhibited sincere concern about the opinions of the Pitt
student body. P .

Finally, we endorse Dan Taylor. He believes the SGB
can be a powerful tool, but only if students stand behind
it. He would like to follow through with some of the
efforts of the current board. His views are practical and
show thorough knowledge of the problems facing Pitt
students.

We believe the Student Government Board is an
important entity of the university framework. It is the one
‘outlet the students have to voice their opinions and make

. their views known. We urge all students to take advan-.

tage of the opportunity to see the candidates of their
choice elected to the board by voting. ~

Letters to the Editor

President Recognizes Problemll

(Editor’s Note: The following letter
was sent to Mayor Caliguiri‘ and to
Commissioners Hafer, Forester and
Flahertyp concerning the counter-
ﬂow buslane on Friday, Oct. 19,
1984-. It is President Posvar's hope
that the more attention is called to
the counterﬂow lane, the more the
university community will be
reminded to use caution to prevent
future tragedies.)

I write to reaffirm as strongly as I
can my concern about danger to
pedestrian public safety imposed by
the bus lane on Fifth Avenue. While
I was abroad a few weeks ago,I was
informed by telephone that yet
another university student had been
severely injured on Fifth Avenue. As
she was crossing Fifth Ave. near the‘
entrance to our Student Union, she
was struck by a bus traveling in the
bus lane. 1 am - greatly concerned

over the strong possibility that there’

will be further tragedies such as this
in the years ahead. I

In a location in which thousands
of pedestrians, most of them stu-

dents, are at times densely crowded ,

on a reconstructed narrow and con-
ﬁned sidewalk, the odds of accidents

will remain unduly high. Simple .
human error raises the probability ‘

that people will, with unacceptable

frequency, forget or fail to heed the .

unusual threat of a busway running

I ' _ against a prevailing traffic pattern.
‘ This already dangerous situation is

compounded by the fact that we
have every year an incoming ‘group
of many students who are unfamiliar
with the situation. .

I appreciate very much that as a
-result of your initiative the Port
Authority has agreed -to modify its
traffic schedules and that the city
will impose and enforce a 15 mph
speed limit on the busway, as well as
installing visual and audible warn-
ing systems, yet I remain gravely
concerned for the safety of our uni-

versity’ community, the students,‘

faculty, staff, visitors and local resi-
dents who pass through our campus.
Indeed, there is even the possibility
of a major fatal disaster in circum-
stances when a large crowd of stu-
dents might lead to accidentally
pushing a number of them into the
path of an oncoming bus.
Hopefully, corrective measures
being considered, plus others (such
as more guardrails and lights), com-

- bined_ with .better education of all

concerned will be notably helpful.
Beyond these, a complete move of

-eastbound buses ‘ to Forbes_;Avenue'

must remain an option. We should
also explore how to develop and
fund an innovative design of a
pedestrian bridge and fence complex
spanning Fifth Avenue alongside
Litchﬁeld Towers.

Let me also assure you that I make
this statement with a completely
constructive intent and in the con-
text of a very high respect for your
leadership, your supportive associa-
tion with the university and your
demonstrated commitment to serve
the public interest. In this case, while
there may indeed be differing points
of view, and while.I am expressing
my concern indefense of the people

- whom it is my duty to serve, the case

for _ safety and preservation‘ of
human life takes an, unequivocal
precedence and- shows the way
toward how the general public inter-
est can indeed best be served in the
vicinity of the university.‘ Here, all of _
us, university administrators,
government’ leaders, local mer-

,_chants, students and faculty, can

take common cause.

Accordingly, I have asked my
staff to cooperate fully with the
elected and appointed governmental
officials to seek aneffective solution
to what is clearly a grave and com-
plex situation. V ’ ' _

Wesley W. Posvar
President

Elections No
Popularity
Contest

Itgis evident from the clutter of
campaign postersin the classrooms
that student government elections
are once again upon us. Those peo-
ple responsible for cluttering up the
classrooms will soon be responsible.
for representing the needs of the
undergraduate population at the

' University of Pittsburgh.- Unfortu-

nately, the Student Government
Board. election often becomes a pop-

' ularity contest. _
I want to encourage voter aware-

ness so that the election will not be
simply a popularity contest, but
rather an opportunity to elect those
most capable of representing the
opinions and needs of the student
body. ,

It is your duty as a student to take

note of the-issues and judge the can- ' .
didates on those issues,_not on the g‘ I  ;

image they present. You should vote
for the candidate who reﬂects your
.views or has innovative ideas for
improving the quality of life at Pitt.
Vote for the candidate who you feel
would be capable of approaching
' university administrators and com-
municating the concerns of the stu-
dents in a mature, responsible
manner. Vote for someone who will
be capable of_ and interested in
‘representing you.
During the week, there is a good
chance you will come into contact
with several of those candidates. If
you live in the dorms, they will be
around to visit you. They will try to
hand you their leaﬂets as you walk
to class. When this happens, stop the
candidate before he rushes off to the
next student and ask him how he
feels about the allocation process or
the,university’s views on the policies
‘of South Africa. Ask him what he
will do for you and the approxi-
mately 20,000 students he will be
representing. If the candidate can’t
give you a satisfactory answer, think
twicebefore you cast your vote.
After" the Student Government
Board elections, everyone asks,
“What does the SGB actually do?”
The best answer to that question is
, to get involved and find out. The
first step in getting involved-is vot-
ing. Realize that an educated vote
does make the difference, but it must
also be followed up with some effort
on your part. These people can’t
represent your needs unless you
make them known.

continued from page three

ment elections. Doperak came in a
distant third with 432 votes.

Despite the abolition issue, the
scandal and the inclusion of a third
party, many students felt the elec-
tion was fairly tame. Perhaps the
excitement of Ron Reagan’s appear-
ance at the Mosque made everything
else seems like small change.

The headlines from The Pitt News
edition of Dec. 8, 1971, read

“Meager Vote Ratifies SG Constitu-_

tion.” In a referendum vote, Pitt stu-
dents approved a new student
government constitution with a
small turnout of 447 students. This
new constitution replaced the exist-
ing one, which was only a year old. It
was the beginning of the present Stu-

‘ dent Government Board. a _ .
The election held the following

month bettered the total of votes
cast in the '71 election (961), but only
1,835 students exercised their right
to vote.

The campaign started out with
four candidates. A‘ fifth candidate,
John Frye, had his petition refused
by the election committee because
he submitted it 10 minutes after the
deadline. Frye contested thedeci-
sion on the grounds that he was late

because he’d been arrested, jailed,

and subjected to police brutality.
His detention in court was the rea-
son for his late entry. The committee
debated and decided the circumstan-
ces were extenuating “beyond our
-wildest imaginations” and accepted
his petition. ‘

The two big issues in the election
were the newly established charges
for services at the Student Health
Service and the one thing that all the
candidates agreed on — that stu-
dents working for The Pitt News and
other student groups shouldn’t be
paid for their work.

Tom Bailey won the elections and,
ironically, of the five candidates, he
had the least to say about his pro-
posals or his platform..

The other candidates weren’t the
only losers in this election. Election
committee chairman Arnie Stein-
berg was helping to move the voting
machines when he became the elec-
tion’s sole casualty. As he was pull-
ing and "another man was pushing
the machine, they came to a slight

grade in the lobby of the Towers.
‘- Steinberg’s partner, forgetting that

Arnie was in front of the machine,
let go. The machine rolled outof
control over Steinberg’s right foot,
breaking‘ two of his toes. .t
“Midway through the decade, an

interesting controversy developed in

student. government elections. In
1975, a group of students banded
together on a ticket using the slogan
“Vote Young Socialist.” The Young
Socialists consisted of four senate
hopefuls and presidential candidate
Steffi Brooks. The five candidates,
listed collectively on their campaign

g_literature,‘received approval to use

the slogan from the election commit-
tee,which then reversed its decision,
claiming the slogan constituted affi-

liation with a political party. This '
— was a no-no, according to the elec-

tion code. The candidates appealed
the decision, but the committee

é rejected the effort.

No quitters these Young Social-
ists, they turned to the Judicial
Review Board for help. The board
reversed the election committee’s
decision, and the Young Socialists
were now free to use the slogan.
Unfortunately for them, they had
spent more time eliminating the slo-
gan from their campaign literature
than they had campaigning. They

‘complained that the ban on the slo-

gan cost them time, money and
material by ‘forcing them to alter
their literature. In the end, it might
have cost them _the election, too.
Brooks finished last in the election.

The remainder of the '70s was a
period of apathy in the elections.
Student turnout at the polls hovered
around l3 or 14 percent. In l984, the

0 year of the vote (on the national elec-

tion level, that is), the" year of
increased student awareness? What
remains to be seen is how this year’s
student will _ change, ‘the personality

lt’s SGB election time again. Time
to try to make an intelligent decision
about who will be using your activity
fees to represent you to the adminis-
tration next year.

For most voting students, cam-
paign promises are probably the sole
factor in decision making. Catchy
phrases like “change the alcohol pol-
icy" and “no tuition hikes” are sure
to please anyone, but at the same

' time, they seem very familiar. Why?

Because similar promises cro.pped
up in last year’s campaign. So what’s
happening? Do the candidates take
their promises seriously?

All of the elected candidates from
last year’s campaign said yes, they
did remember their campaign prom-
ises after the election, but, especially
for first-timers, the realization of
what can be done and what can't in
SGB hits hard once they enter office.

A member of this year’s board and
a candidate for next year’s, Avery
Abrams mentioned he felt that most
of the promises more difficult to exe-
cute are not insincere, only a com-
mon mistake of overly enthusiastic
first-time campaigners.

“lt’s'part of the inexperience and
blind ambition," said Abrams about
his own campaign last October.Of
last year’s alcohol policy promises,

he "said, “It's not going‘ to be .

changed; it might be revised ...” For
beginning members of SGB, he
added, “the entire first semester was
a learning process.”

Pamela Hart, another member of
last year’s board, added that when
she campaigned last year she “knew
very little about the operations of
the student government board." The
alcohol policy issue was also a vital
part of her platform, but upon
beginning her SGB term in the

spring of ’84, she found the adminis- _

tration resistant to any major
changes. On dealing with the admin-
istration, Hart added, “You can’t be
radical or you won’t even get your
foot in the door.” ‘

Pamela Hart is running for SGB
president with almost the same
motives as in last year's campaign —
minus the alcohol policy issue.

Her major promise last year was
to try to solve the problem of student
apathy at Pitt. She feels that she has
been attacking this problem whole-
heartedly on this year’s Student
Government Board.

“The main thing is public rela-

tions,” said Hart. She established an‘

SGB Affirmative Action Standing
Committee upon starting her term

last January. The committee con-
centrates on the rights of women,
minorities and the handicapped on
campus.Hart feels that it has pro-
moted more student participation in
SGB.

Like all other candidates who
made promises last year, Hart has
also met up with a few dead ends.
Last year she said she would like to
set up a scholarship fund for minori-
ties, collecting contributions from
local businesses in Oakland. She felt
they had an obligation to the stu-
dents to “put back into” Pitt some of
the funds they got from the univer-
sity community. “I never went to the
businesses," said Hart. She stated
that she now realizes “the businesses
wouldn’t be willing."

Hart also said she planned to con-
front the elevator problem in the
Towers dormitories, a situation she
considers “deplorable.” Hart states
that she talked to administrators in
the Office of Resident Life and was
surprised at their disinterest in mak-
ing improvements. “I was ﬂatly told
that the elevators have ten more
years of service,” Hart said. '

All first-time campaigners from
last year experienced the same diffi-
culty, while incumbents like Ken
Stram, this year’s SGB president,
felt they knew better. “I,definitely
realized what was realistic,” said

. Stram, “that's why I didn't make any

The work of the SGB this year

[such] promises,“

Looking at the promises of last
year's candidates and their defenses
of them as this year's SGB term
comes to a close, it becomes obvious
what. types of campaign promises
can be carried out in a one-year
term.

Avery Abrams made quite a few -

appealing promises in last year’s
campaign for Student Government

Board. Among them was an enthusi- .

astic plan to enstall cable television
in the dormitories, Abrams claimed
he put priority on following the pro-
ject through. “This isn’t something
that's been forgotten," said Abrams,
who stated that he has spoken to
‘everyone from Office of Resident
Life administrators to the assistant
vice president on the matter. He
mentioned the reason that there is
no cable television even in the Stu-
dent Union is due to the poor finan-
cial state of Pittsburgh’s Warner
Cable Company. He found drawing
up a contract with them to be impos-
sible. “I wasn't aware of the ‘deep
financial problems with Warner,”
said Abrams about last year’s
promise.

He also took a stand against the
financial policies of SGB in last
year’s campaign and said he is try-
ing to follow this through with a
protest against the SGB renumera-

The Pitt News, Monday, October 29, .1984

A look at the past year of SGB effort

continued from page ﬁve
tions policy, which suppliesboard
leaders with a salary taken from the
Student Activities fee. “I didn’t
accept one paycheck,” he affirmed.

I “That’s your money, something bet-

ter could be done with that.”

Abrams said he needs to continue ‘

for another year in SGB to secure a
student representative on the board
of trustees. He claimed it is a com-
monwealth law _to have a student
representative to the board and said
the current fill-in for the position is
“a. 35-year-old man. Hc’s talking gin
and tonics.” “When you look over
these other issues, cable television
just doesn’t stack up,” stated
Abrams.

Bob Kramer is also a candidate
for SGB president. He successfully
campaigned for last year’s board

with a fairly conservative set of
promises. He said he thought the

v.ost important improvement for
Student Government Board would
be in student participation.

Kramer has been one of the driv-
ing forces behind the Freshman
Council this year, and he said he
believes it will significantly promote
increased participation in SGB for
years to come. For solving student
apathy towards SGB, he stated “it’s
one of the best things we’ve done.”
He stated that the council boasts
“almost perfect attendance” and is
already involved in such campaigns
as ‘Watch the Bus,’ which deals with
the problems of the Fifth Avenue
buslane.

“We made them part of the stu-
dent government. not a standing

committee,” said Kramer, referring
to the council.

“It was a bandwagon. That’s what
everyone wanted to hear,” Kramer
said about the popularity among
other candidates to address the alco-
hol policy issue in last year’s cam-
paign. About his own promises, he
said,“I took mine seriously.”

The members of this year’s board
not running for re-election felt that
this term has been a. productive one
for SGB, ‘and campaign promises
have been taken much more
seriously than in previous years.

Many promises remain unfulfilled
by board members though, despite
their relevance to problems which
still exist even a year after their cam-
paigns. Board members in their final
academic year said urgent issues,

such as the need for increased library
hours and the installation of walk
lights on the corner of Baum Boule-
vard and Forbes Avenue, which
were major promises in their cam-
paigns last year, are legal or security-
related issues that take time to
execute. Graduating board
members Betsy Fitzpatrick, David
Pikovsky and Jeff Mallinger all
seem frustrated with the shortness of
their one year.

According to Pikovsky and Fitz-
patrick, one of the reasons fulfilling
promises can be difficult is the time
constraints imposed because of the
strict SGB schedule.

“You come in in January, and

within two months, you’re thrown.

into allocations,” said Pikovsky, ref-
erring to the mandatory allocation

chance to travel.

“There’s not much you can do about

Experienced campaigners all
stated they expected ambitious

promises from new candidates who
are not aware of some oftheir limita-
tions, but Jeff Mallinger feels that all
of this year’s campaign promises are
sincere. “I don’t see any sensational-
ism,” he said.

SGB president Ken Stram gave
some insight into the reliability of
campaign promises. “You can make
promises and you can work on
them,” said Strarn, “but you can’t
always fulfill them.“

About Town/ J. Stephen Lewis

There has been a disturbing trend
on this campus, and therefore in this
newspaper, that has reached what
may now<be a critical state. More
and more news stories are written in
that mushy and slimy manner that
makes them difficult to grasp ﬁrmly.

If you are so fortunate as to grasp
the meaning of one of these stories,
do not apply pressure, for it will
surely squish through your ﬁngers. I
refer to that enemy of real thought:
“objective journalism.” It is a thing
that has allowed such transparently
ridiculous and damaging events as
the university’s bicentennial celebra-
tion to be reported as good and wise.
Of course, no human mind is objec-
tive; each is the sum of the parts of its

existence and therefore sees the

world through the eyes of that sum.
This being so, to laud “objective
journalism” as a supreme and sub-
lime good is to call truth a lie, crime

justice, or black white. The resulting

problems should be self evident.
Apparently, though, they are not,
for not only have news stories been
“objectivized," but so.have editor-
ials, letters to the editor and
columns. How many of these end
with such admonitions as “If you
can’t say something nice, don’t say
anything at all!” How many assert
that “It is easy to complain and cri-
ticize, but let’s see you [insert appli-
cable verb]  How many seem_ to
sigh in frustration that everything
would be all right if we’d just shut up
and let the experts be our shepherds?

Well, too many. The sole purpose of
editorial matter is to be ‘critical. It is

not merely to complain but to be
critical in the most non-perjorative
sense.

If economic experts contrive an
election-year recovery that strains
and pushes the economy towards the
precipice of economic failure, can it
be wrong for one to criticize such
action in a rational and fair manner

for the purpose of correcting a prac-
tical problem? Can it be wrong to
wonder what statistical evidence
President Posvar has to warrant an
expression of pride in the University
of Pittsburgh and to ask what such

evidence might be so that we might
all be so glib? Can it possibly be

wrong to suggest what might be
done with one’s own money? By
definition, it cannot. Indeed, there is
a practical good that can arise from

such probing. A real problem will
not go away no matter how tightly
we squeeze shut our eyes or avert our
awareness.

It is only through a process of
squarely facing a problem in three
dimensions — seeing it in its fullness
— and then making adecision based
on such observations, that practical
solutions might arise. When this
occurs, a group of people might do

something together. Without this,

individuals in. a group live com-
pletely apart from one another in
fear, emptiness and self-pity.

SGB   board candidates air in

.24.

i  "Lake J. Kluchko
Luke .1. Kluchko said his expe-

' rience with the Allocations Commit-

tee has been ideal preparation for
assuming the office of SGB presi-
dent, primarily because it gave him
the opportunity to work with the
administration. This is something,
he said, “I think I do well.” This
administrative insight is,something,

' the other candidates lack. Kluchko

added, “I think I’m aware enough to
perceive the problems and concerns
of the students.”

One of the primary goals of his
platform is to set up budget work-
shops. Many organizations don’t
know the budget submitting proce-
dure and many board. members
don’t understand the process well
enough to make allocation decision
he said. He would also like to set up

 

mandatory board member-student
organization liaisons.

Kluchko wants to bring the SGB
to the students by reestablishing the
Student assembly and holding
board meetings in larger rooms so
more people could attend them.
According to Kluchko the room
they are using now only holds about
twenty people.

He said he would like to establish

two classes of commuters; those that .

live in the immediate"area and those
who commute from the suburbs, so
the board can better. meet their
needs. _

Other issues he said he would like
to address are extending Hillman
Library hours and getting the place-
ment center to keep more up-to-date
lists and information on job oppor-
tunities. Kluchko said that several

presidential candidates

Current SGB member Pam Hart,
founder of the Affirmative Action
Committee and the only undergrad-
uate representative on the Provost’s
Task Force on Planning, said her
strength as president of the SGB
would be her experience with
administrators and the administra-
tive process at Pitt.

Her platform is centered on the
idea that the SGB should become
more active in what she considers
serious issues. “Right now," she
said, “the SGB deals only in alloca-
tions and services.” Services, ‘she
explained, are those things that
make a student's life a little easier.
“They [services] are important,.but
she said.

Two issues that Hart considers
serious are the consistency of tuition
hikes and commuter parking.

“The parking facilities at Pitt are
horrendous," said Hart, who is a
commuter.

She feels possible solutions to the
problem, would be adding parking
lots, getting more time per quarter
on the meters or starting a Pitt-
operated shuttle bus service that
would extend into the student-
populated suburbs.

Hart called nine consecutive years
oftuition increases unfair to stu-'
dents and feels this should be halted.
She said the problem would be best
solved by working closely‘ with the
administration and perhaps lobby-
ing state legislatures for additional
funding for Pitt.

Solutions to the parking and tui-
tion problems, are only in the idea
stage she said, and will require" a
great deal more research. Hart

   
   

added that SGB will not be able to
deal with these issues properly until
it evolves into a more credible and
respected organization.

Two other issues she would like to
see addressed are improving the
working relationship between the
board and its committees and the
board and the administration. Also,
she would like to make the board
more visible and accessible to the
students.

Robert T.—Kramer

Robert T. Kramer, board member
and founder of the Freshman Coun-
cil, said he sees a great deal of poten-
tial in the . Student Government
Board and would like the opportun-
ity to run it. -

A basic -problem the board cur-
rently has,‘ according to Kramer, is
that it is perceived simply as body
that allocates funds. “We [SGB]
have to reach out more and be more
active.”

Two proposals Kramer said he
would enact as SGB president are
the redefining of the Student Assem-
bly and the printing of weekly SGB
reports in The Pitt News. The pur-
pose of this would be to make the
board more accessible to students.

The Student Assembly, he said, is
potentially an ideal means for stu-
dents to make the board aware of
their problems and concerns. How-
ever, he said, in order for this to
occur, the assembly’s functions and
goals must be redefined. One prob-
lem the assembly has encountered,
he said, is apathy from student

orgainzations. This problem could ,

be solved by giving the assembly
more responsibility and thus giving
them added incentive to actively

‘participate, Kramer claimed.

Other planks in Kramer’s plat-
form include a ‘mandatory liaison
between board members and stu-
dent organizations to facilitate the
allocations process, compiling a stu-
dent directory which _he said would
be a good opportunity to utilize the'
Freshman Council, and the re-
establishing of the Legal Awareness
Council, a free legal service Kramer

,said is greatly needed at Pitt.
/

Kramer would like to see Hillman
Library» open 24 hours during mid-
terms and ﬁnals. “Rightinow,” he
said, “it looks like we’re going to
have to fight a lot of bureaucracy or
find alternative places where stu-
dents can study. The administra-
tion,” he said, “respects our [SGB’s]
opinion, but I don’t think we utilize
as much power as we could. That
[utilizing SGB’s power] is one of my
main goals.” .

‘ \

And now...meet the board candidates

    

Avery Abrams

Avery Abrams is running with an
edge — experience.Abrams served
his first term last year and is seeking
reelection.

‘‘I’d like to finish the things I’ve
started," he said. According to
Abrams, some of the “things“ he
hasn’t gotten a chance to finish are
definite plans for the buslane and
South African divestment.

Abrams plans, if reelected, to look
into reopening the internship office
full-time. He also would like to see
an, escort service started at the
university.

“If you’re somewhere on campus
late at night, you can give them a call
and you don’t have to walk home by

yourself in-the dark and be scared,"

he said.
Abrams praised the current board
for their creation of the Freshman

Council. “I think that was the most

important step this past year: train-

 ing people on how things should be

done so that when they want to run
next year or the year after, you're
going to have some really qualified
candidates." ,

According to Abrams, SGB is
misunderstood on campus. “I don’t

workings.” Abrams expressed con-
cern that the good job done by this
year's board continue.

“This past board has set the
groundwork. In order for that to
continue, I think somebodyhas to
be on the board to show new
members exactly what has to be
done. I think that's going to be
pretty much my role.” ,
(Editor's Note: Candidate Avery
Abrams said he will neither seek nor

accept the Pitt News endorsement‘

for his campaign for Student
Government Board.)

Greg A. Cederlof

‘According to Greg Cederlof,
being a member of SGB will add to
his education while enabling him to
help others.

Cederlof served on the Alloca-
tions Committee last year. He feels
this experience gave him insight into
the workings of the board.

If elected, Cederlof would like to
get students enthused about student
government. The Freshman Council
is another area Cederlof is interested
in. “I'd like to see the council

student government, seeing that 80
percent of Pitt’s population is made
up of commuters,” Cederlof said.

An allocations workshop is one of
Cederlof’s _ideas. “Problems in
budgeting occur not only [due to
inexperienced student groups but
also because of uninformed board
members. If we can get a workshop,
it will add to a much smoother
budgeting process."

Cederlof feels he will have no
trouble working with the adminis-,
tration. “At the beginning of this
term, I was appointed as the under-
graduate student representative to
the Bicentennial Commission of the
University of Pittsburgh. I've come
into contact with all the higher offi-
cials and I really don’t see any
obstacles.”

Cederlof said the only obstacle he
may have to face is lack of student
enthusiasm. “That’s what I want to
work on," he said

_.Iege. It would be easier if roommates

Lisa Douds, a junior majoring in
microbiology, said her experience
on the Allocations Committee and
the CAS Council of the University
Senate have helped her gain insight
into the policy and- procedures of
student and faculty organizations.

Douds said the University Senate,
is “a potentially powerful means of
voicing student opinions,” and
would like to see ‘ the system
strengthened. If elected, she said, she
would form a committee called the
United Council of Student Senate
Seats where a representative from
each University Senate Subcommit-
tee would meet with the four Stu-
dent Government Board representa-
tives already sitting on the Senate to

discuss ideas presented to the Senate I

Council. -

Douds voiced concerned for what
she sees as a communication gap
between the students and the
faculty. She would like to see a stu-
dent/faculty forum established
where students can sit down with the
faculty and discuss some of their
concerns. Along the same lines,
Douds wants to see representatives
from each of the schools to ‘get
together and try to talk and let each
other know what is going on, in the
hopes of promoting unity, she said.
“Without communication, nothing
can get done, ” Douds emphasized.

“I want to get people excited and
to realize the importance of the Stu-
dent Government Board,” Douds
said. “I want to try to uplift the way
people perceive the board."

Other items included in Doud’s
platform are computerized room-
mates where students could be
matched with other students who
have similar interests. “Students,
especially freshmen, have enough
problems adjusting to being in col-

got along,” Douds said.

She also would like the Internship '
Office to return to full-time status,
and she wants to- see a commitment
to liaisons between the Student
Government Board, the Allocations
Committee and student groups. ~

“The Student Government Board '

has a lot of good starts,” Douds said.

“I would like to-follow through on '

these ideas to see progress.”

Douds sees her role as a prospec-
tive Student Government Board
member as a challenge, and she
thrives on such challenges. ‘

Karen L; Frost

Karen Frost is seeking election to
the Student Government ' Board
because she feels her qualifications
will enable her to bridge the gap
between the administration and the
students. “l’ve been involved in stu-
dent government and have a good
working knowledge of it. but I think
I could do more," Frost said. ‘

last two years. She has also served as
Academic Affairs Committee chair-
man‘, student representative to the
Academic Freedom and Tenure
Committee of the Faculty Senate,
and has been an active member of
Emerging Leaders.

Frost would like to see more stu-
dent involvement in government.

She feels this goal can be attained by »

expanding orientation programs of
the university to include open
houses held by the committees of the
board.

“This year, they brought up fresh-

men to the SGB. That got a lot more- .

students interested," Frost said,
adding that she would like to see that
type.of introduction to the board
continue.

The student attitude toward the
SGB is not as positive as it could be,
according to Frost, who said, “It has
grown more positive, but there's
need for change. They [the students]
need to know we’re working for
them.” I

With regard to the current board ’s
performance, Frost said she thought
they had done a “pretty fair job.”
She’ mentioned the work done on
improving the buslane and the
internship office as- examples of this
board’s hard work '

 

    

Roger Morris
Roger Morris feels his personal
leadership abilities and his diverse
education are some of the factors

that make him a good choice for a

seat on the SGB. Morris is in the

i ' fourth year of a five-year pharmacy

program and has held officer posi-
tions in at least six other campus
groups, including honoraries and

, fraternal organizations. “With that
- background, I feel I’m qualified to

run for SGB,” he said.
Morris’ platform has three spe-

cific planks. “The first? I’d liketo see

a .24-hour library,” he said. Morris
feels the idea is feasible, and he pro-
posed starting theprogram with one
floor of Hillman library or another
campus -library.

Second, Morris would like to«

reform the university food service.
“There are about a million things
wrong with food service," Morris
said. The university should provide
the campus with a snack bar that
would not have to be open 24 hours
a day but would have more than
what Morris termed “token hours.”

Pitt’s alcohol policy concerns

- ‘Morris. “I don't think the university

should be able to regulate as much as
it does. When you’re 21 years old,
you can drink anywhere else in the
whole country. You should be able
to drink in your own room,” he
stated. “I’d like to see a committee
set up between students and the uni‘-
versity to come. up with a fair

‘ policy."

As a student with -a professional
major, Morris wants to represent the

professional schools from a board’

position. “I'd like to see the reputa-
tion on campus and nationally
increase with all the professional
schools," Morris said. He added that
increased national recognition
might help Pitt graduates of profes-
sional schools find jobs more easily.

“SGB has the ability to motivate
students and get things done for the

students. It doesn’t always do it." _If

elected, Morris would like to foster
good relations between board

members and work together to
accomplish student goals. Morris
would want to see SGB meetings
publicized and solicit more student
input.

    

James Mumma

Sophomore James Mumma is
running for SGB because he feels a
need to increase students’ awareness
of their governing body. As a
member of the Governmental Rela-
tions Committee and the Academic
Integrity Board, Mumma feels he is
qualified for student government.

“I know how the Student Govern-
ment Board _operates.” Mumma
said. He hopes to get more students
involved in the work of the board if
elected. “We need student input. We
need to know the problems students
face.” .

Mumma also said he is interested
in looking into decreasing.the cost of
_textbooks. Along those lines, he
mentioned having a comprehensive
listing ‘of used books printed up.
“We can put it in a centralized listing
instead of having to run all over
campus looking for signs people
have," Mumma said..

Library hours also concern
"Mumma. He feels that during mid-
terms and finals, the library should
stay open longer. “I think this is
something that the students want,"
said about extended
library hours. “I'd like to see if it
really is by opening channels to the
student government." _

Mumma thinks the current board
has done a good job. ‘

He feels, however, that the current
board looks at itself too much as an
allocator of funds. “I don't think the
board goes to the administration
enough. I think they need to get
involved in deeper issues "

 

   

Peter Petropoulos

Experience, decision-making
abilities and leadership are the quali-
ties candidate Peter Petropoulos
would bring to the SGB if elected.
Petropoulos also stressed the impor-
tance of his year-and-a-half tenure
on the SGB Allocations Committee
and knowledge of the workings of
SGB. “It consisted ofa lot of time in
the office going over budgets,” he
said.

Petropoulos cited student aware-
ness of and participation in student
government as the first plank in his
platform. “We have so many places
where students could have input if
they were aware of what's going on,”

views in election ‘

he said. The candidate proposed the
removal of board ._committee
members who did not regularly
attend their assigned meetings. “A
lot of students take these up as
resume stuffer,” he said. He added
that SGB couldwork to train stu-

' dent leaders who might someday run

for SGB positions through the new
Freshman Council.

Petropoulos ,wants to see a closer
relationship between the student

1 body and SGB. “I want students to

know that we’re not there just to
allocate the money,” he said. “There
have been a lot of things done,” he
said. “All studen_t problems can be
dealt with, and the point is to
address the concerns of all students,
because all the problems are the con-

cerns of all students.”

Michael T. Ryan
Michael T. Ryan calls himself a

A candidate with a “difference.” His

work in student activities is the tan-
gible experience Ryan feels would be
beneﬁcial were he elected to sit on
the Student Government Board. “I
got to see a lot of how the adminis-
tration works and how the people

who run the administration accom- '

plish their tasks.”

Ryan discounted the emphasis
other candidates place on specific
issues. “Usually you hear about peo-
ple’s problems. I don’t want to reit-
erate what everyone else says." Ryan
stated that he felt that campaign
promises are often not kept. “It
seems that they say, ‘that’s my plat-

form,’ but they just go up there and

they just do their regular duties as a
student government representative.
Ryan said while he would perform

. his duties as a member of student

government, he would be more

— attentive to the needs of students

and trying to get things ‘done.
Ryan admitted he may have some
problems implementing his pro-
grams if elected. “Student govern-
ment is sort of set in its way by the
administration," he ‘said. ‘Ryan
hopes students will take the initia-
tive and help him’ achieve his goals.
“Hopefully, this will decrease the
student apathy problems," he said.
Ryan feels SGB d_oes a good job
with allocating money but could use
their position to better inform the
students as to SGB’s actions. “There

have been a few members who have.-.

worked on this, andl would most
like to follow in their footsteps.”

Daniel M. Taylor

“I have the experience of the typi-
cal student," said Dan, Taylor, a
; sophomore majoring in English

literature,‘ “and I understand the

problems they encounter."

Taylor said he too experienced the
inconveniences of commuting and
of the teaching assistant who could
not communicate -adequately with
the students because of a language
Because he . experienced
these problems, he feels that he has a
good basis to make changes. He
added that he knows how to deal
with people because of his involve-

’ ment with his fraternity and the

Governmental Relations Commit-
tee.Taylor said he would like to fol-
low -through with the mandatory
teaching evaluations and wants to
enforce the same evaluation policy
for the teaching assistants. He would
also investigate the reasons behind a
salary freeze for teaching assistants
and not for the other faculty
members, he said.

The student health fee, which is
mandatory for all undergraduate
students except for those enrolled in
the College of General Studies, is
not fair, according to Taylor. The
rationale behind this policy, he said,

is that since a majority of those stu-_

dents enrolled in CGS classes com-
mute, they probably will not use the
University Health Service. Taylor
said this is ‘not fair because approxi-
mately 80,percent of those enrolled

gram would help the teaching assis-
tant in the long run as well,”

Weinbrom concluded.

Student transportation concerns
the candidate. “I’m convinced PAT
is not effective, and what I would
like to see is an effective shuttle bus ,
system serving Squirrel Hill, Shady- -
side and other areas," he said. “I
want us to also buy the lot across
from Hillman Library and charge
the students $15 or $20‘per semester

to‘ park.“ '

As the third plank in his platform, '
_Weinbrom proposed a 24-hour sche-
dule for Hillman Library. He would
like to see the facility staffed by stu-
dents during the evening hours not
only to keep the library open but to
provide work study jobs for the stu-_
dents. “I’m after it, and I believe in

it,” he said. «

When asked what SGB does best,
Weinbrom replied, “Nothing." The

candidate said he would be willing to

I fight for the students‘ requests and

rights but feels the current board
does not do enough in this direction.
“There are a lot of broken prom-
ises," he said. “Why aren’t things
getting done? That bothers me. I
want SGB every week to provide a
rundown of everything that has hap-
pened in SGB. That includes voting
records. That would fight apathy,

in CAS classes commute as well, and i and I'm convinced that apathy starts

therefore should be given the same
option. “Tuition is rising and unnec-
essary costs must be cut,” Taylor
said. “Students should have the
opportunity to ask themselves if the
student health fee is important to
them.“

“The university has power," Tay-
lor said. “Student Government

Board can_be a very powerful tool if

§tudents get behind it," he added.
However,’ he cautioned, students
should be more realistic in respect to
their demands on the administra-
tion. The requestto keep the library
open for 24 hours is one example.
Taylor said he can seethat because
of finances this may not be possible,
but there are other solutions that he
would like to investigate, including
having only one ﬂoorremain open
for 24 hours, while the other floors
have extended hours.

Taylor said the current board has
done a lot of good things, but he
would like to take them further.

“If the board has confidence in
themselves, they can do a lot of

things,” Taylor said. “My views are -
‘realistic, well-thought-out views

that can be respected.”

Part of the reason Reid B. Wein-
brom would like to be elected to the

Student Government Board is to ‘
_ voice the opinions and needs of the

older student. “That's what I'm try-
ing to bring out in this campaign,"
he said. Weinbrom came to Pitt after
a four-year stint in the U.S. Navy
and feels his perspective as an older
undergraduate and his leadership
abilities acquired in the service
would be aplus for the board.
Weinbrom‘s platform is threefold.
“Number one, I want to see a set
screening process for all TAs,” he
said. Weinbrom proposed this pro-
gram for all departments and all’

TAs, foreign and native. “This pro- ~

Jacci 

Jacci Willis said there are a lot of

functions that affect students which

are not fair, and she wants to be able

to address those concerns.
Willis said she was concerned that

commuting students are not given

the same considerations that resi-

‘ dent students are given when univer-

sity activities are planned. She

would like to see more attention.

paid to the commuter‘s needs when
functions are planned.

Willis also expressed concern for
resident students‘ needs. She said the
policy to hold an entire ﬂoor respon-
sible for damage unless someone
takes responsibility is unfair, and
she would work to see that that
clause is removed from the housing
contracts.

Communication is important in
Willis‘ platform. She questioned the
criteria on which the advisors for the
College of Arts and Sciences are
chosen, because she said she feels
there are some advisors who cannot
adequately communicate to the stu-
dents information they may need.
She said sheesaw a problem with
some of the university teaching

assistants, because for many of them - -

English is a second language, and

students find it difficult to commu-_

nicate with their teachers.
“If the board is going to work

closely with the administration, they 

must work closely with the students
as well," Willis said. “There are stu-
dents who feel that the Student
Government Board isvnot forthem. I
would like to let students know that
the board is for them,” Willis said. “I
want to acknowledge the students,
letting them know that their input
can help. I want to alleviate the
unfairness of university political
functions," Willis said. “I have the

leadership and drive to make things -

better."

For the Pitt News

Mention the name Todd Mulzet
to University of Pittsburgh diving

coach Julian Krug and a smile‘

immediately comes to Krug’s face

and there is a twinkle in his eyes. It's

no wonder.

Mulzet, a junior from Bethlehem,
Pa., is doing everything he can to
make his coach happy.

“Todd is —a super athlete,” Krug
said. “When he came to Pitt he was a
free spirit. He still is somewhat, but
he has matured a lot and I am really
pleased with that. He has really
developed and it shows in his diving
and in his academics."

The development of this talented
Panther diver really showed last sea-
son when the walk-on was voted Big
East Diver of the Year after winning
the one-meter event and placing
sixth in the three-meter. He is hop-
ing to reach even higher levels this
season.

I “I would really like to make it to
the NCAA Division I nationals this
year," Mulzet said. “I am shooting
for the top 16.”

In diving, the top- I2 receive All-
America honors, and Mulzet has the
talent and the right attitude neces-
sary to achieve such status.

“His goals are tough ones, but
very realistic," Krug said. “In the
zone we are in, there are only four
spots to go on the one- or three-
meter. He will have to do some real
good diving. There is a lot of compe-

tition from the team and from the
zone, which includes all of the
schools in the East.

“He is capable of diving really
well, though. He understands what
he has to do. He has to make sacrifi-
ces and he is willing to make. them
consistently.”

When watching Mulzet in prac-
tice, you can tell that he is still some-
what of a free spirit. Although he is
serious about diving, he likes to have
fun and make the practice sessions
enjoyable. 0

The Panthers had a scrimmage
with West Virginia recently to help
them prepare for the upcoming sea-
son which begins with the Penn
State Diving Invitational on Oct. 26-
27. There was not a lot of serious
diving competition, but the trip did
prove useful.

“The diving we did was just for
fun,” Mulzet explained. “It was to
get used to different boards. You get
used to seeing certain thingswhen
you are diving in practice and it
helps to dive in a different place.”

Most athletes get started in sports .

with the encouragement oftheir par-
ents, but Mulzet’s story is.a rather
unique one.

“I started diving in the ninth
grade,” Mulzet said. “I was sitting in
one of my classes and there was an
announcement that during the next
period students who were going for
physicals for the swim team would
be excused from class. My next class
was algebra and I did not like it, sol
decided to go. I talked to some of the
people there and eventually they
convinced me to go out for the div-
ing team.” 0

PHILADELPHIA (UPI) -
Following in the footsteps of
Mike Rozier, two more profes-
sional football players have
admitted to signing with agents
before the expiration of their col-
lege eligibility.

According to a story published
in the Philadelphia Inquirer,
Jerry Robinson and Mike Quick
of the Philadelphia Eagles
admitted to signing with agents
before they completed their col-
lege football careers. Both were
Eagle first-round draft picks,
Robinson out of UCLA and
Quick out of North Carolina
State. Each claimed that he
signed early in order to’ meet
financial needs.

The newspaper quoted Quick
as stating that about 90 percent
of the players selected annually
in the first five rounds of the
NFL draft sign early with agents.

MIAMI (UPI) — The Miami
-Dolphins rolled to their ninth
straight win yesterday, a 38-7
rout of the winless Buffalo Bills.

The Dolphins raced to a 24-0
halftime lead and never looked
back. Pitt’s Dan Marino threw
three touchdown passes, two to
Mark Clayton and one to Dan
Johnson. Woody Bennett and
Pete Johnson also scored a
touchdown each for the
Dolphins. ' .

ANAHEIM, Calif. (UPI) —
The San Francisco 49ers col-
lected their eighth win of the
season yesterday when they shut
out the Los Angeles Rams 33-0.

Joe Montana passed for 365
yards and three touchdowns,-one
each to Freddie Solomon, Roger
Craig and Dwight Clark.

The Rams fumbled the ball
four times. They got inside the
49ers’ four-yard-line twice, but
came away emptyhanded. It was
the 49ers’ first shutout in over
three years.

M. Ray Ferguson was another
winner at the Homecoming dinner
on Friday. Ferguson graduated in
1954 with, like Bigley, a business
degree. Ferguson was a triple letter
winner on the Pitt football teams of

the early 1950s. ’

Originally from Jersey Shore Pa.,
Ferguson is currently the executive
vice president of the Republic
Health Corporation and president
of the Republic ' Health Manage-
ment Company in Dallas. Ferguson
co-founded Republic Health Man-
agement in 1981.

Pitt’s head baseball coach, Robert
H. “Bobby” Lewis also won a Var-
sity Letter Club award. Lewis, as
well as serving as Pitt's program-
ming and scheduling coordinator
for men's varsity sports and teaching
physical education classes, has been
the Panther baseball coach for the
past 30 seasons. His 376 victories
rank him as Pitt’s all-time winning-
est coach.

Lewis lettered three years on the
Pitt baseball team. He was the
Panthers’ team captain in 1951, the
team’s co-MVP in 1950 and earned
his first letter in 1949.

The final award winner was Dr.
Michael Zernich of Aliquippa. Zer-
nich was the captain of the 1952-53
basketball team and won the Char-
les Hartung award in 1953. The
award has special meaning for Zer-
nich: winning it runs in the family.
His older brothers Stephen and
Wallace, have each won the award,
in E973 and 1978, respectively.

Zernich has been an orthopedic.

ThePlttNews

Fox Chapel’s Thomas Bigley was
one of four men honored with the
University of Pittsburgh Varsity
Letter.Club’s Award of Distinction

V at the Twenty-fourth Annual Home-

coming Dinner on Friday at the Wil-
liam Pitt Union.

The award is given to four
members of the Pitt Varsity Letter
Club who have distinguished them-

selves in their profession and
enhanced the value of the intercolle-
giate athletic program at Pitt. '

Since earning his business degree
in 1956 and lettering on the Pitt
baseball team for three years, Bigley
has remained close to the university
while becoming a managing partner
in the Pittsburgh office of Ernst and
Whinney.

Bigley was selected from a ballot
of nine Varsity Letter Club members
who earned their letters more than
25 years ago. The selection was
based on what the winners have

accomplished outside of college to
help the Pitt athletic program.

Bigley’s winning resume includes
being president of the Pittsburgh
chapter of the Pennsylvania Insti-
tute of Certified Public Accoun-
tants, a member of the board of
directors of the Pittsburgh Chapter
of the P.I.C.P.A. and a member of
the Institute of Certified Public
Accountants; Bigley has also
authored various articles for the
CPA Journal and the Pittsburgh
Business Times.

Soccer team trims GCC 2-1

By Kirsten Gostony
The Pitt News _

It was evident that enthusiasm
and determination helped inspire
the Pitt soccer team’s 2-1 victory
over Grove City Saturday after-
noon. “It was an exciting game, with
both teams playing hard. I’d say it
was one of the better games all year,”
said head coach Joe Luxbacher. “It
was an especially‘ big win for us since
they are_such a strong team.”

A quick-ﬁre start gained Pitt its
first goal from sophomore Todd
Smith, assisted by Dave Van New-
kirk, only 28 seconds into the game.
“I was able to stop the ball, and had
seen Todd hold back, while the rest
of our teammates continued on by.
‘He had a shot on goal, and he just
put it away,” recalled Van Newkirk.

Later in the first half, the effort of
Tom Fouley and Craig Freund put

the Panthers ahead 2-0. The goal by

Freund came off a corner kick,

which had been assisted by Fouley.
Despite their halftime lead, Pitt

‘was obviously having a few prob-

lems on defense. “We had some mix-
ups on defense where we failed to
clear the ball in front of our goal. As
a result Grove City was able to re-
cover the ball, giving-them a number
of opportunities to score, but fortu-
nately they didn’t connect,”
explained Luxbacher. _

“In the first half our defense was a
bit lax,” agreed Van Newkirk, “but
in the second half we began to con-

‘ centrate on it, which enabled us to‘

maintain control of the game.”

Each win brings the Panthers a
step closer to the Big East Cham-
pionships, but they’ve yet to face
such tough competitors as Indiana
University of Pennsylvania and
Carnegie-Mellon University. The
match against CMU will be the first
of two, and will be played on Tues-
day afternoon.

“We were going for the ﬁeld goal,”
Jelic said after the second onside
attempt. “I dropped back and was
going left. Chuckie [Scales] was run-
ning a pattern in from the sidelines,
and I knew the defensive back was
behind him. As it turned out, I
underthrew him [as end Eric Fudge
intercepted the pass].”

Jelic, though relieved by John
Congemi for a while in the second
quarter, completed eight of 15
passes for 24 yards in each half. Pro-
duction for the day, though, came

The tie went more to his head than
the rushing performance.

“I don’t feel like answering any
questions right now,” the usually
affable Heyward insisted.

His running left no questions that
Pitt’s running attack has at least sta-
bilized; he started in place of fresh-

man Charles Gladman, the rushing,

Promising start

By Jim (Irban
The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh’s
mens . and womens diving teams
traveled to Penn State over the
weekend to participate in the Penn
State Diving Invitational._ At the
competitions end, few in Happy _Va1-
ley could be happier with the results
than Pitt diving coach Julian Krug.

The Panther men and women fin-
ished ﬁrst and second respectivelyin
the meet, which featured such teams
as North Carolina, James Madison,
Connecticut and Penn State.

The men, behind the diving of
Jack Shuten, showed the prowess
that has let them dominate the Big
East for the past two years. With
Shuten heading the charge by plac-
ing in, both the 1-meter and the 3-
meter competition, fellow
teammates Mike McCalley and
Mark McCormick'only had to put

‘ the finishing touches on Pitt’s cham-

pionship performance. Both divers
joined Shuten in the finals ——
McCalley in the 3-meter and
McCormick in the 1-meter.

The women put on quite a perfor-
mance, too, but came in second
place behind a tough Penn State
team. Krug claimed that he was
“tickled pink” at his teams perfor-
mance against a veteran Penn State
squad. The women were led by Tri-
cia Schultz and Tricia Ney, who
both placed on the 1-meter and 3-
meter boards. .

Krug hopes that the success his
squads enjoyed at the Penn State
Invitational will only be the begin-
ning of many more sparkling perfor-
mances this season. Krug called
Pitt’s performance “an outstanding
overall performance at this time of
year." He also remarked, “We
should have an outstanding team
before the year is out."

The teams hope to use the Penn
State meet as a springboard to a win-
ning season of dual meets. The
Panthers travel» to Penn State on
Nov. 8 and Michigan on Nov. 9 for
dual meets. They return home to
host the Pitt Invitational on Nov. 16
at Trees Pool.

McCalley-, a junior who was the
1982 Big East 3-meter champ, will
compete in the U.S.A. Diving meet
at Cleveland State next week.

7 after a 9:15 drive. Snuffy Everett
shanked the extra point.

With 1:57 to go before the fourth
quarter, Heyward bolted 18 yards

‘around the right end for the 28-14

lead.

The Midshipmen ran less than
Heyward’s total (63) but got a school
record performance out of Byrne,
whose touchdown passes tied him
with two alumni at 10 and whose
200-plus yards made him only the
second signal-caller in Navy history
to accomplish the feat in back-to-
back games.

 

Throughout the game, Byrne
exploited left cornerback Quinton
Jones, a freshman who is the third
player to start that position this
year. Both of Byrne's scoring passes
went Jones’ way. “Coach [Fazio]
told me after the game to keep my
head up,” Jones said, “and that I
have a good future ahead of me.”

For head coach Foge Fazio and
others, that is all the Panthers have
to anticipate right now. “Like I said,
I felt sorry for the players having to
put up with this," a worn-out look-
ing Fazio said. “We’ve been through

everything, then this happens. The I

big plays seem to erase everything."

“This season goes with you wher-
ever you go," tackle Bill Fralic
admitted. “You can’t forget about it.
Every game seems more bitter than
the last one. It’s like the Penn State

game [24-24] last year.We thought '

we had it won, then they end up
tying it.

“You’re never happy, especially
when it happens like this. Maybe
Navy is the happiest because they
showed a lotof guts in the last four
minutes."

  season

'1 By Bob Travers
The Pitt News

These indeed are desperate times
in the house that Majors and Dor-
sett built. Ihings are so bad that the
35,000 diehards that took their seats
on the Pitt stadium bleachers on
Saturday took to trying the Wave
against, of all teams, the Naval
Academy. It is uncertain whether
the fans were trying to make the
Midshipmen feel more at home or
simply attempting to amuse them-
selves until the final two minutes of
the fourth quarter.

So the Panthers are 1-6-1, and

bringing in the new year in New
Orleans or Dallas is becoming a
fond memory for Pitt fans. But as
was evident on Saturday, there is
still some reason to hope,that the
Panthers will return to those major
bowl locales before the Class of ’88
graduates or before the construction
on the the Cathedral lawn is fin-

’ ished, whichever comes first.

For one thing, Craig Heyward is
emerging as the Panthers’ most con-
sistent runner, especiallyeat home.
Against Navy, Heyward rushed for
140 yards, his second consecutive
100-yard ‘day at Pitt Stadium. Hey-
ward, a freshman, now has 362
yards, enough to be the team’s
second leading rusher. Number one

4 is Charles Gladman, another fresh-
man, who has.377 yards. Add to this
the fact their neither back has played
a full game all year and the potential

for future 1,000-yard seasons is_

      

 

Craig Heyward, a six-foot, 230-pound freshman, gained over l00‘yards against Navy.

clear. But right now, the old cliche of

“being a year away" certainly ap- -

plies, and until the‘runners gain
more maturity, Coach Foge Fazio
and his staff have some nagging
questions.

OMarc Bailey rushed for 34 yards
on one second-period drive to help
set up a Pitt touchdown and then
was not heard from the rest of the
day. “I don't know why I didn’t play
more. Nobody told me anything,”
Bailey said of his disappearing act.-

0Late in the second quarter with
Pitt ahead l3-7, Fazio brought in
John Congemi to replace Chris

Jelic. Congemi wasted little time in
lofting a touchdown pass to Bill
Wallace, and bingo, it was 21-7. But
in the second half, Jelic returned and
Congemi was back in nowhere land.
When asked about the switch, Fazio
said only, “We felt John deserved a
chance to play,” and “Yes, we con-
sidered bringing John in during the
second half.”

‘ 0Chuckie Scales, Pitt’s second
leading receiver, .was thrown to only
twice on Saturday, and both passes
were incomplete. The only time
Scales touched the ball on an offen-
sive play was on a reverse. a play that

gained 2l,yards.

Both players and coaches are
bewildered. Finding no earthly
answers for his'team’s demise, Fazio
said, “It’s fate. This seems to be a
bad luck team. I feel sorry for the
players." Cornerback John Lewis
called it a case of divine interven-
tion. “Maybe the man upstairs just
said, ‘you’ve spent three New Year's
Daysin a row in a bowl, and now its
time to even things out.’ ”

Despite the nightmarish season,
the Panthers refuse to roll over. Said
senior linebacker Caesar Aldisert,
“We still have to go out and play.

hard every day. We won't give up. If
we do, then we aren’t even a football
team anymore. I thought we played
well today. The end wasn’t exactly
how we wanted it, but you have to
give Navy 2 lot of credit."

Remember, this wasn’t a loss. It
just felt like one. If one sentence
could sum up the attitude that per-
vaded the somber Pitt locker dress-
ing room after the game, Dante
Wiley said it. Sitting ona stool in
front of his locker, Wiley cast his
eyes downward and said, “It just
can’t get any worse.”

Pitt ties Navy after losing lead

 

ports Mon

day   e

October 29, 1984

By Mark Sindler

The Pitt News

Ne’er-do-wells would do well to
note the degenerative efficiency
exhibited by a football team protect-
ing a lead late in the fourth quarter.

In another unaccountable
performance, this time at Pitt Sta-
dium, the Panthers watched a once-
impregnable 28-14 lead transform
itself into a 28-28 tie against Navy,

3 all in a matter of 84 horrific seconds.

Of the 34,715 homecoming day fans
in attendance, a third up and left one
quarter early, prematurely satisfied
with an at-least I4-point victory.

Instead, they were deprived of
watching a l-6-l team exit the field
with what can be considered a sev-
enth loss against a 3-3-1 Midship-
men squad.

Two and a half minutes remained
in the game before Navy quarter-

back Bill Byrne rallied Navy’ behind

an ll-play, 68 yard drive complete
with pure passing except for his 1-
yard TD keeper. Pitt’s lead still
seemed secure,’though, as Todd Sol-
oman’s PAT attempt hit the left
upright as 1:24 remained with the
Panthers up 28-20.

What followed was anti-climatic.
Soloman, on the kickoff, lined the
ball into the turf, propelling it at
least two.feet above the first line of
Panthers. Navy’s Greg Stefanon, the

first to retrieve it, gave the Middies

the ball; five plays later, Byrne
wafted a touchdown pass to split end
John Lobb.

Navy coach Gary Tranquill then
lined up tight end Mark Stevens and
ﬂanker Tony Hollinger to the left of
Byrne with split end Chris Weiler to
his right. Obviously Byrne would
weave a three-yarder to Weiler since
he’d been keying on Pitt’s leftside
secondary all day, right? Plus Weiler
hauled in nine passes for 157 yards
already.

‘ Piece of cake, except that it didn't
happen the way it had all afternoon.
On the snap, Byrne shifted the entire
unit right, except a blocking Stev-
ens, shifting right cornerback Mel-
vin Dean right as well. Byrne
retraced his steps and fired into
Stevens’ inviting arms.

“We were in a five-squat [forma-
tion] with two ends to the left,” Dean
said later, “and I went over too far
left. I gave the tight end time to get
open in my zone. He came around
from the line of scrimmage and was
able to get open. I didn’t realize I had
gone too far until it was too late.”

“I just sprinted out and lofted it,”
Byrne said nonchalantly. “I guess it
could have been a little more of a
spiral, but it wasn’t.”

Soloman tried another one-sider
— “Isaid the hell with it, we had
come this far, why not try it again,”

.Tranquill said —— though it landed

out of bounds. And suddenly, a Pitt
offense that had moved the ball
freely for the first three quarters
found itself bedeviled. "In the
remaining 54 seconds, quarterback
Chris Jelic threw an interception
once and several seconds later
clearly ran out of playsbefore Navy
sewed up the tie.

The Pitt Hockey team, which is entirely self-.
funded, won convincingly over the weekend.

Midshipman Tony Hollinger’siconcentration pays off in six points for Navy, which came back

Alumni banquet salutes Sutherland 

By Laurie Kubli
The Pitt News

The 24th Annual Homecoming
Dinner was held Friday at 7 p.m. in
the Multi-purpose Room of the Wil-
liam Pitt Union. The program,
which was emceed by TV personal-
ity Bill Hillgrove, featured remarks
by Athletic Director Dr. Edward
Bozik, a tribute to Jock Sutherland,

a}1¢_i~ the presentation of several pres-
tigious awards‘. _

An appearance was put in by foot-
ball coach Foge Fazio, who referred
to the team’s state of affairs as a
“crisis situation,” and tri-captain
Troy Benson, who said, “Well not
give up on this season.”

Dr. Bozik directed most of his
remarks to the plight of the football
team and urged continued alumi

» support. He also spoke of the enjoy-

ment the Pitt alumni, faculty and
students have gotten from the team’s

past performances. He. said the uni-
versity last year spent $4.1 million.
on the improvement of the athletic}

facilities and an additional $1 mil-

lion in operations and scholarships.

“Does this sound like a university

that's giving up on a commitment to,
excellence?” Bozik asked.

“It ‘was one of the most
emotional‘ tributes that

could ever be given to me. ”

— Julie Gaul

“It's .obvious that our football
team is not performing at the levels
that we’ve come to expect,” Bozik
continued. “But we’re confident. We
are fully aware of the deficiencies,
and we will take appropriate action.

However, this is not the time for rash ,,

or precipitous action. The Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh will continue to
act responsibly as an institution of
higher education.’/’

A tribute to Jock Sutherland, for
whom Stadium'Drive was renamed,
was given by Trustee Emeritus Herb
McCracken, chairman of the
athletic department's board of vis-
‘itors and originator of Scholastic
Magazine. “Jock was a giant in his
time’and will remain a giant in our
memory. I came to know and respect
him over 70 yearsqago when I, as a
young boy, delivered milk at 5 a.m.
and he was a member of the police
force.”

Sutherland was a successful Pitt
football coach in the 1920s and
stressed fundamentals with his play-
ers. He was I44-28-13 and embodied
“perfection, power and ceaseless

’ flfillS.” “A house is only as strong’ as
its foundation," said McCracken..
, “No fruit or fancy stuff, just-

fundar'nentaIs.” . _
. Severalawards were given out,
including four,Awards of Distinc-

V tion. The recipients were Thomas G.

Bigley, M. Ray Ferguson, Bobby
Lewis ‘and Michael R. Zernich. Two
George I. Carson Awards were given.

to students who have served Pitt in
supportive roles. Varsity cheer-'
leader Marian Schmidt and athletic
trainer John Thomas were honored

with this award. Richard A. Duko-,

vich received the Allen K. Colling-
wood ., Award, and Julie Gaul
received the J. Clyde Barton Award
as “-the outstanding woman senior
athletically and academically.”

Gaul, who is assistant coach of the
Pitt women’s volleyball team, was
voted the Big East Conference MVP
as a senior in 1982. Gaul had not
been told by head coach Shelton
Collier that she was receiving the
award and was emotionally dis-
traught as she walked onto the stage.
Gaul said that McCracken’s tribute
for the now-deceased Jock Suther-
land was moving and that the unex-

‘ pected award that she received was

too.much to handle. She still had
tears in her eyes an hour later, when
she said, “It was one of the most
emotional tri_butes that could ever be

"given to me.”
