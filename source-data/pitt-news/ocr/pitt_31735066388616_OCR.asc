UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH —

Babbht

speaks at
Pitt

By Frances Sansig
Managing Editor

Democratic presidential candi-
date Bruce Babbitt engaged in
some handshaking and some
headshaking —— but abstained
from mudslinging Sunday after-
noon when he made an appear-
ance at the University of
Pittsburgh.

The former governor of Arizo-
na spoke before a crowd of 400
at David Lawrence Hall about his
platform, which includes the
need for increased taxes and
reduced expenditures.

”That deficit is there like a great
anchor against progress,” said
Babbitt, who most notably advo-
cates cuts in military and domes-
tic expenditures.

His position on student aid is
consistent with his federal
expense—slashing program.
”There are other priorities out
there, I gotta be honest with
you,” said Babbitt. ”I believe that
every student in this country
should have access to higher edu-
cation.”

Babbitt said he began sensing V

the real issues weren't being dis-
cussed about a year ago when he
presented his agenda to Iowans.

”I began to understand that if
we believe the progressive tradi-
tion of this party  we've got to
look that issue straight in the
eye,” he said. ”The problem is
not Americans  it is not the
voters  it's the people who are
running for office.”

Babbitt has suggested a ”needs
test” as one means to achieve his
goal of reduced expenditures. He
calls it ”the principle that I advo-
cate for honesty.” The proposal
is specifically targeted to help
those who need it the most,
namely the poor of society.

He also supports what he calls

Jon Wells/The Pitt News

Former Arizona governor and democratic presidential candidate Bruce Babbitt spoke to
Pitt students on Sunday at David Lawrence Hall.

”workplace democracy,” a plan
by which workers would have a
greater influence in the work-
place, consequently increasing
productivity.

Babbitt said that upon arriving
in Pittsburgh, he had viewed the
rusting steel mills and saw that
the city was in a state of transi-
tion. ’’I believe the industrial
economy must be restored,” he
stressed.

”Workp|ace democracy,” he
believes, would respond to the
growing needs of a declining in-

dustrial society. ”Executives are
rewarding themselves with life-
time security while workers are
being handed pink slips," he
said.

His position on other policies:

0 Strategic Defense Initiative:
”I would cancel S.D.I.”

0 Abortion: He is pro—choice.

0 Contra,-Aid: He is against it.

Last November, Babbitt had
been added to a list of politicians
who admitted to drug use, putting
himself in the company ofjudge
Douglas H. Ginsburg and

another presidential candidate,
Albert -Gore. ,

It has been speculated that
these admissions have, perhaps,
”humanized” them among youn-
ger voters, according to
Newsweek.

His speech was sponsored by
the the Democratic Forum of
Western Pennsylvania, a non-
partisan group that organizes po-
litical functions. He left to cam-
paign in Philadelphia after a
reception in the William Pitt
Union.

Civil rights activist commemorates King

By Scot Ross
Staff Writer

As tribute to the birthday of
Martin Luther King Jr., the Black
Action Society welcomed civil
rights activist Ralph D. Abernathy
to Pitt. Abernathy spoke about
the civil rights movement, as well
as commenting on the program's
theme, ”It’s Left to Us.”/

Abernathy is perhaps best
known for his stand along with
King and other black leaders in
the Montgomery, Ala., bus boy-
cott from 1955-56. The boycott is

regarded as a significant step in
the civil rights movement and
presented the world with a vivid
picture of the discrimination
blacks faced.

”We have come in commemo-
ration of the life and work of Mar-
tin Luther King Jr., who was my
dearest friend and closest associ-
ate,” Abernathy said. ”Martin
Luther King and I were known as
the civil rights twins. We were
perennial jai|mates.”

Abernathy said that his arrests
were not criminally related.

’’It [the arrests] was not for

stealing. It was not for lying. It
was not for breaking the peace.
It was only for standing up for the
rights of my people, black people
and poor people in this country.
These times are in the past, and
if necessary, I will do it again.”
Abernathy directed a portion of
his program toward the trouble
he sees in the White House.
”Ronald Reagan is doing noth-
ing to make the dream of Martin
Luther King live,” he said.
”People have to have someone
in which they can believe,” said
Abernathy, ”someone that is go-

ing to do right and tell you when
you are right and when you are
wrong.

”Martin Luther King would
want his dream to stay alive,” he
added, "and as long as there is
breath in my body, I am going to
remind this nation  of what
Martin Luther King’s dreams
were.”

Abernathy stressed the current
problem of racism. ”Racism ex-
ists not only in the United States,
but racism exists all over the
world,” he said.

Doctors
discuss
minority

treatment 

By Brendan Kevenides
For The Pitt News

The Student National Medical
Association held its Annual
Regional Convention this past Fri-
day and Saturday with the theme,

”The Physician’s Responsibility

to the Minority Community.” F

The. Convention, which was
hosted by Pitt's School of Medi-
cine, was held in the William Pitt
Union and was the first SNMA

convention to be held in [Pitts- _

burgh, according to Linda
Holifield, chairperson of the
Regional Convention Publicity
Committee.

Holifield stated that the pur-

pose of the convention was to
make future members of the med-
ical community realize the im-
portance of dispensing health
care to all members of the com-
munity, especially to the minori-
ties which have been traditionally
ignored. .

”No one should lack medical
care,” said Dr. Morris Turner, a
privately practicing/gynecologist.
Turnersaid that the ”key” to
modern health care is education.

”That [education] is as impor-

P tant to health care as ’hands—on’

treatment,” he added. ”There is
a need to bring preventive medi-
cine to this area [the minority
community].”

The advice Dr. Ronald David,
deputy secretary of public health
for Pennsylvania, gave to future
doctors was to not only give
professional advice but to show
compassion toward patients. He
stressed the need to tell patients
how important they are along
with how important health care
IS.

”Making a difference is what
medicine is all about!” David
said.

Terence Thomas, a third-year
medical student at Pitt and an
SNMA member, said that the
SNMA not only wishes to treat
minorities but also to reach as
many as possible when it comes
to health care.

Thomas said that the SNMA
will be conducting a blood pres-
sure screening at the East Liberty
Presbyterian Church on Jan. 31.
He said they hope to conduct a
similar program at the Mon-
roeville Mall before the end of
the year. _

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, January 19, 1988

RADNOR, Pa. — More than 80
percent of Americans polled said
televised debates will influence
them in their choice for president,
according to a survey released
Monday. _

The survey, commissioned by
TV Guide magazine, said 84 per-
cent of those polled would con-
sider the debates, while 54
percent think general television

coverage of -the campaign is bi'- K

ased. Of the latter group, twice as
many said the bias was liberal as
said it was conservative.

”As far as the format is con-
cerned, Americans are split
almost 50-50 over whether the
presidential contenders and their
running mates should be allowed
to debate each other directly or
whether the traditional practice of
letting reporters question them
should be continued,” the.maga-
zine said.

Seventy-two percent ranked a
candidate's warmth as a very or
at least somewhat important qual-

‘ ity, according to thejan. 23 issue

of the magazine.
The survey, based on tele-
phone interviews last September

and October with a cross-section
of 1,000 adult Americans, also
found that 38 percent said unflat-
tering revelations about a candi-
date’s sex life should be aired
immediately; 47 percent would
prefer not to know about it.
4 Among other findings:

_ “Eighty-two percent judge good
looks to be of little or no impor-

tance in their choice of president, L

and 62 percent similarly dismiss
g a candidate's youthfulness.

“Sixty percent think a sense of .
humor is important to a great or

moderate degree. 7

THE PITT NEWS, Tuesday, January I9, I988

Babbitt’s policies too good to get him elected?

When Bruce Babbitt an-
nounced his candidacy for the
presidency of the United States,
he said that he would be the can-
didate who would dare to be
different. People are starting to
see that he is right.

Although Babbitt is trailing in

' Iowa and New Hampshire, he is

starting to be noticed in the na-
tional media. Some observers say
that this romance with the press
may do himin.

University and a Pitt medical
school hopeful, said that her ad-
viser told her that this convention
would give her a good perspec-
tive on her future career.

The Student National Medical
Association was established in
I 964.

Babbitt was the former two-
term Governor of Arizona
(1978-86). He also served as that
state's attorney general. Before he
entered politics, Babbitt was a
civil rights lawyer who helped
the Navajo Indians win a voting
rights case against the state of
Arizona.

Babbitt’s main political plat-
form is based on his proposal to
reduce the deficit through a 5
percent National Consumption

JONATHAN BERR

Tax and the ”Value Needs Test-
ing” of federal programs.

Babbitt said that the consump-
tion tax would be progressive and
would exempt food, clothing
and, to some degree, shelter. It is
similar to a sales tax. Babbitt said
that it would encourage people to
invest.

Abernathy

Continued from page 1

Abernathy said that he is a very
proud American citizen. ”This is
my country. I have fought and
defended it in time of war.”

Responding to a vicious re-
quest he received in the mail tell-
ing him to go back to Africa, he
said, ”How can you go back to

where you've never been?
’’Blacks are here to stay. But we
are not going to_stay with our
heads bowed down, waiting for
Martin Luther King to come back.

”Martin Luther King gave his

_ tion tax” on all non-essential items and cut even further into

educational assistance.
He claimed that while his ideas weren't pleasant to consider,

they represented an ”honesty and truth-telling” that is sorely .

missing from this year's presidential campaign. At this point
in the race, it seems that Babbitt’s strength continues to come
from his willingness to tell voters some of the things other can-
didates might decide to omit from their speeches.

His summary ofthe economy andmthe deficit is disarming in

2 its simplicity. Tobegin cutting theVdéfic,it and rebuilding the

industrial foundations of the economy, Babbitt claims, it is
necessary to cut spending and increase revenue. According to

"the Babbitt doctrine, increasing revenue means increasing tax-

es, an idea that makes a good deal more sense that some re-
cent claims from other candidates.

While most of the other Democrats are talking about the ”hard
choices” voters are going to have to make to get the economy
back on its feet, Babbitt is making public committments to some
specific policies.

The idea that the current problems of federal overspending
can be corrected by putting more money in the system is seduc-
tive, but Babbitt is going to have to remember his pledges to
cut defense and domestic spending with the same clarity with
which he recalls his new tax ideas.

Without such restraint on spending, the problems he is try-
ing to control would possibly grow larger. For now, Babbitt
is shaping up to be one of the favorite choices in the Democratic
field. Although he doesn't have the mass media presence that
blesses Gary Hart, he may find that substance can win over style.

* _Ir_1 response to Matthew Thornton's article [from] Jan. 11 -—
”A peek inside the gates of Armageddon” — Mr. Thornton once
again uses his editorial position to express his beliefs and un-
belief in our political system.

Each candidate is given the usual parody due him by the edi-
tor in the name of freedom of speech for all. And yes, the usual
irreverent synopsis that leaves the reader with a jaded view of
the system. Respect for the religious beliefs of others is disregard-
ed [under the] assumption that the reader does not believe in
God anyway [...]. I

If Mr. Thornton believes that Communists and Pacifists are
condemned by Pat Robertson, then why doesn't he write about
all the wonderful things communism has done for humanity,
instead of falsely accusing Mr. Robertson.

And by the way, Mr. Thornton, please read the story of Ar-
mageddon in the Bible, so that you can correct yourself. There
are no ”gates of Armageddon.” It is a battlefield, and you can
find it in the book of Revelation. Before you judge these candi— E
dates, and God, at least do your homework and know what
and whom you are talking about. '

PAIII. ANATER

'I'I-IE NAKED CITY

And there were pine boughs

fastened “to the bannister and

draped over every doorway in the
house. The smells of holly and
bayberry mingled warmly with
cinnamon and tangerine. It was
a glorious week, spent in a home
neatly wrapped in good compa-
ny and red velvet bows.

I stayed at my parents’ house
for break and could very easily
have spent the entire week on the
livingroom couch. However, I
was invited to a Christmas party
and decided to go.

It was an afternoon party, held
on the day before Christmas Eve.
I left my cozy livingroom couch
and drove to Lancaster. As I was
coming up the on-ramp to Route
222, I saw a car parked alongside
the ramp, and standing next to

. the car was a man, who was

thumbing for a ride.

It was the day before Christmas
Eve, and I was in a good mood,
so I stopped to pick him up.

His name is Ron. For the 20
minutes of our drive, I heard a
story I don't think I'll ever forget,
and I learned a thing or two about
dealing with hardship.

He is a Vietnam vet. During his
stay there, he saw a good bit of
action, and at 19, saw more pain
and suffering than he ever
thought he would again.

He didn't want to talk about
Vietnam very much, though; he
seemed more interested in talk-
ing about ”the good old days” of
being young in the late '60s. He
once hitchhiked from Philly to
San Francisco alone, he shook
hands with Bob Dylan, went to
Woodstock, tuned in, turned on
and dropped out.

”I’m glad to see this stuff is still
around,” he said when he saw
my Grateful Dead and Janis
Joplin tapes.

I opened a Pandora's Box
when I asked him what he was
doing with his life now.

He stared out the windsheld,
cleared his throat, and asked me

if I would listen to something he
really needed to unload, and I
told him I would.

Two years ago, he was jumped
(”ambushed” was the word he
used) by a gang as he walked
down a deserted street. They
caught him by surprise and pret-
ty much beat him senseless.

FLASHBACK TIME. When he
came to in the hospital some
hours later, he had regained con-
sciousness, sure enough, but for
the past two years, it’s been an
uphill battle to regain control of
his mind. Being jumped on a city
street brought back experiences
he'd thought were long buried.
Tragedy he had never dealt with
came. rushing back and nearly
destroyed his psyche. His life has
been shredded since then.

He used to run a shelter for
runaway and troubled teens. The
governing organization of the
shelter said he was ”unfit” and
fired him with no severance.

A year ago, his wife walked out
on him and took their three chil-
dren, whom he hasn’t seensince.

Before his mugging,. he was
preparing to enter a seminary to
become a minister. He couldn't
take the entry tests because when
he applied for them, he was in a
psychiatric ward, thus making
him ineligible.

He has been in and out of
Veteran's jAdiminstration psy-
chiatric wards four times since his
mugging. If he commits himself
again, he'll be placed in a long-
term facility. Placement in a long-
term facility leaves a person with
a scar, as does short-term care,
but long-term is a different story.

It passes a life sentence; it
leaves a stigma that ruins lives.
Our society is still mired in
medieval preconceptions of men-
tal illness and mental patients,
and the concept of condemning
people to long—term psychiatric
care is proof of that.

Combine all of the aforemen-
tioned with the fact that his car

had just died, and he was facing
a Christmas alone, and I would
have thought he'd be ready to
take the bridge. ‘

Not Ron. He has resolved him-
self to pick up the pieces and take
control. To have heard someone
who has undergone such hard-
ship speak so resolutely was in-
spiring. To have heard him taking
responsibility for getting himself
back on his feet was even more
so. Not once did I hear a tone of
blame, or self-pity. Not once did
I doubt his sincerity.

He made me think a lot about
the stigma that psychiatric pa-

‘ tients wake up to every day; how,

upon hospitalization, they are
routinely stripped of their civil
rights; the obscene connection
between law enforcement and
mental health (”court commit-
ted” psychiatric treatment) and
expenses incurred at the hands of
”caring professionals” ($1,050 a
day for a spacious room in
Western Psychiatric is a case in
point).

People in the industry claim
that One Flew Over the Cuckoo's
Nest portrayed the psychiatric
care of a time long past. ”Things
have changed,” they claim. So
now white walls are beige, and
patients go to art therapy instead
of sweeping floors. My, my, my,
my, my, now they are big
changes. Am I getting preachy?

I was more angry than he was
about something he has to deal
with. V J

I gave him my parents’ phone
number and an invitation to
spend Christmas with us. He was
grateful for the ride and the invi-
tation. I apologized if I had
opened up a can of worms, and
he just thanked me for listening
and wished more people would
try to understand. He told me I
had given him a gift many peo-
ple don’t care to give — time.

I dropped him off on King
Street and finished driving to my
party, where everyone was well-
dressed, well-fed, well-loved and
generally unappreciative. I drank
two beers and went back to my
parents’ home, thinking existen-
tial thoughts the whole way.

Happy New Year, Ron.

Stewart showcases talent in All-Star Classic

By Don Boyd

Staff Writer

Standout Pitt volleyball player
Lisa Stewart participated in the in-
augural Yugo East-West Collegi-
ate All—Star Classic last Saturday
at the University of the Pacific in
Stockton, Calif. ESPN taped the
match, and it will be shown this
week.

Stewart, a 5-foot-9 outside-
hitter from Farrell, Pa., has been
a Lady Panther stalwart since

transferring from the University of
Tennessee after her freshman sea-
son. Stewart has been an All-Big
East selection the last three years
as well as being named Big East
tournament MVP in 1986.

Pitt has participated in the last
two NCAA tournaments with
Stewart playing a key role. This
past season, she was second on
the team in kills with 352, help-
ing the Lady Panthers to a 37-6
record.

Editor in Chief

Mike Goodson, Pitt's starting
point guard last season, has
decided not to enroll for winter
semester classes and will proba-
bly transfer to another school.

Goodson was ruled academic-
ally ineligible in September. He
had said he would enroll for
winter semester classes to regain
his eligibility for next season but
changed his mind at the last
minute. i

NOTEBOOK

Goodson was unavailable for
comment.

Pitt Coach Paul Evans said he
doubts Goodson will ever play at
Pitt again.

Rutgers and Long Beach State
are the two schools Goodson is
believed to be interested in trans-
ferring to.

Pitt (ranked sixth by The As-
sociated Press) is currently se-
cond in the Big East with a 3-1
league record. The Panthers are
13-1 overall.

Pitt is half a game behind Vil-
lanova (4-1) and half a game

The Panthers’ play in their

gerald Field House last Saturday
left some favorable impressions

team finished second to Penn

College on Saturday. The Nitta-

town Hoyas (35).

Despite placing second, Pitt

added. ,

Villanova was most impressed
with Pitt's defensive play, which
has improved dramatically since
last season.

Pitt's opponents are shooting
only 39.8 percent from the field.
Pitt held the Wildcats to 43.4 per-
cent, and that was the second
best percentage a team has shot
against the Panthers this year.

Last season, Pitt's field goal per-
centage defense. was 44.2
percent. ,

Plansky said Pitt's defensiv
play has nothing to do with ta-
lent. ”Defense is all intensity.
There isn't any skill involved. It's
a matter of how badly you want
to play it. Pitt wants to play it very
badly.”

Demetreus Gore continues to
surge. The 6—foot-5 senior for-

’ team,” said Vasvary.

The Panthers’ downfall was a
direct result of being outscored
46-6 in the field events by the
Nittany Lions. Not a surprising
developement when one con-
siders the lack of winter training
facilities at Pitt for field events.

Several Panthers turned in out-
standing performances. Eric Can-

obviously pleased over Stewart's
being chosen to participate in the
All-Star Classic. ”Lisa’s selection
to play in the Classic is the most
prestigious honor ever for a Pitt
women's volleyball player. She
was a key factor in our great sea-
son. It is quite an honor for our
team to have a representative in
the game," said Collier.
Stewart had mixed emotions
when leaving for California last
week. ’’I was nervous when I left,
but once I got there, I realized

everyone else was just as ner-
vous. It turned out to be a lot of
fun. It was an opportunity to meet
some of the best players in the
country. I had the opportunity to
meet the U.S. women's volleyball
team as well as working with the
Special Olympics,” said Stewart.

Going into the match, the West
team was a heavy favorite. The
California girls were expected to
dominate Stewart's East team.
However, the East team exceed-
ed expectations before losing to

the West in the fifth game 12-10,
in a match played with 12-point
games.

Commenting on Stewart's play,
Collier stated, ”I was real proud
of the way she played. She was
the first sub at the outside-hitter
position. Several times, Lisa
sparked East comebacks with her
strong serve. It was a good day for
Eastern volleyball. We hope that
Lisa's strong play set the ground-
work for other Pitt players play-
ing in the Classic.”

Steelers’ Stallworth, Shell retire

By Alan Robinson
AP Sports Writer

John Stallworth and Donnie
Shell retired Monday after 14 pro
seasons, leaving center Mike
Webster as the only remaining
veteran from the Pittsburgh Steel-
ers’ four Super Bowl champions.

Stallworth, a three-time‘ Pro
Bowl wide receiver, and Shell, a
punishing hitter and five-time Pro
Bowl safety, will be honored in
ceremonies Friday at the Steelers’
offices. ‘

”We’re going to miss them,”
Steelers President Dan Rooney
said. ”lt’s obvious what they have
meant to us.”

Stallworth and Shell joined the
Steelers as rookies in 1974 and
quickly helped them become the
NFL’s team of the decade. Their
retirements were expected, since
both players hinted that after the

arms-control talks between the
U.S. and Soviet Union, Knight es-

said some veterans wouldn't be
offered 1988 contracts.

’’It has been wonderful. But it's
time. It's time to move on,” Stall-
worth, 35, told The Pittsburgh
Press from his Brownsboro, Ala.,
home.

’’All I ever wanted to be was a
teacher and a coach, but football
turned out to be my calling in
life,” Shell, 35, told the Press.
’’I’m real glad.”

Stallworth and Shell came to
Pittsburgh during perhaps the
greatest one-year talent grab in
NFL history. The Steelers select-
ed wide receiver Lynn Swann,
linebacker Jack Lambert, Stall-
worth and Webster on the first
five rounds of the draft and
signed Shell, a little-known
defensive back from South Caro-
lina State, as a freeagent.

lific playoff receivers ever-in pro

basketball team in a game at

sulted the visitors and, from that
humble start, destroyed the game
altogether,” the magazine said.
Knight was reprimanded by the
university and later apologized
for taking his team offithe court.
New York Mets outfielder
Darryl Strawberry was a close
runner-up, the magazine said,
and ”forever the Nice Guy con-
tender” John McEnroe claimed
third place.
Strawberry was cited for his be-

led the Steelers with 41 catches
for 521 yards and two touch-
downs this season and holds six
team receiving records.

Shell was passed over during
all 17 rounds of the 1974 draft
but made the roster because of
his physical play on special
teams. He became a starter in
1978 and holds the NFL record
for interceptions by a strong safe-
ty with 51.

Shell was picked for the Pro
Bowl for five consecutive sea-
sons, 1979-83, and was the Steel-
ers’ most valuable player in 1980.

others are Terry Bradshaw, Larry

”Contending he had a virus, he
also missed two games, but on
one of those days, he was well
enough to go to a recording ses-
sion at a New York studio,” the
magazine said.

McEnroe ”made the race in-
teresting. In 1987, he drew
$16,850, plus $20,000 in bonus
fines. When a tennis player ac-
cumulates $7,500 in fines, he
draws a $10,000 bonus fine. An
envied achiever, McEnroe hit the
bonus twice, earning, in the
process, the ”Nice Guy bronze.”

Junior Tricia Rickert won the
200-yard butterfly and the
200-yard individual medley.
”Those are two events she
doesn't usually swim, and its
nice to have that versatility,”
said Belowich.

’’I like to swim other events
so I don't get bored with al-
ways swimming my special-
ties,” said Rickert.

Senior Michelle Ranck and
freshman Kara Moxie took se-
cond and third in the 200-yard
butterfly. ’’It was one of
Michelle's lifetime best in but-
terfly. She’s the ultimate ath-
lete,” said Belowich. ”She’s
extremely dedicated and a
walk-on who never misses
practice and continues to find
meaning in it week in and
week out,” he continued.

Freshmen Liz Sari and
Rachelle Stauffer placed first
and second in the 1,000-yard

steals (15), tied for third in assists
(26) and is first in minutes played
(33 per game).

Lane's 17-point outing against
Villanova marked the first game
this season he has led the team
in scoring.

And, yes, Lane is up to a
slightly-Iess—than-respectable 56
percent from the foul line. He's
made 20 of his last 24 attempts.

Statistics don't tell all, though.

, In fact, Lane's stats are down from

last year.

But Evans has seen a big im-
provement from Lane in another
vital department. ”l’ve been say-
ing all year, his attitude has just
been tremendous. He has his
head on his shoulders, and he's
doing the right things right now.”

Lane's leadership was evident
_in the second half of the Villa-
nova game. When Smith went to
the bench with his fourth foul at
17:32 and Pitt leading 42-36,
Lane took control.

Granted, he scored only six
points in the next 16 minutes, but
he held the team together with
his rebounding and ballhandling

against Villanova pressure.
Cl El E3

Pitt is only a fourth of the way
through the Big East Conference
schedule, but the Panthers have
passed the midway point of the
regular season slate. So what (or
who) has been the biggest sur-
prise for Pitt so far?

”Sean [Miller] and Jason [Mat-
thews] are the biggest surprises
on this team,” Smith said.

Actually, all four freshman
have been pleasant surprises.
Miller and Matthews along with
Bobby Martin and Darelle Porter
are averaging 30 points, nine re-
bounds and 10 assists a game.

Here's a sample of what each
player has done individually.

0 Miller, who appears to be a

‘leading candidate for Big East

Freshman of the Year honors, is
averaging 10.5 points.

He has given Pitt a legitimate
three—point threat, leading the
team in all three-point categories
— threes made (30), attempts (59)
and percentage (51 percent).

Miller also leads the Panthers
in assists with 70 and has com-
mitted only 31 turnovers.

O Matthews has started every
game and is averaging 9.4 points.
_He is Pitt's leading free throw
shooter (88 percent).

0 Porter averages only 4.3
points, but may be the Panthers’
best passer (second on the team
with 37 assists) and is one of the
top defensive players on the
team.

0 Martin receives the least
playing time of the four freshmen,
but that's mainly because it's
hard to find reason for Smith and
Lane to sit on the bench.

Martin has come through with
some clutch performances. His
four free throws in the last minute
and a half sealed Pitt's win at
West Virginia. And he played
well against Villanova when
Smith headed to the bench with
his foul problems.

[3 E El

Evans received his third techni-
cal of the season with 7:39 left in
the Villanova game. Evans was

- complaining that the officials

were letting Wildcat point guard
Kenny Wilson get away with too
much hand—checking on Miller.

Said Evans: ’’If you get a tech-

swim. I'm very pleased with
her,” said Belowich. ”She’s

improved tremendously.”
Sandy Albright won the
100-yard backstroke. ”Sandy
continually swims backstroke
and she comes through every
time. She's only lost this event
once all year,” he added.
Junior Maureen Cleary won
the 100-and 200-yard breas-
troke. ”Mo’s still not quite
right physically. She swims
with a lot of pain. She still
does a really good job and
continues to get better,” said
Belowich.
, ”We’re still working really
hard and lifting,” said Cleary.
’’I’m happy with where I am
right now, but I want to keep
improving with every meet.”
Senior co—captain Marian
Cassidy won the 500—yard
freestyle. ”Marian has been
swimming backstroke but
responded very well to swim-
ming freestyle. She provides
leadership by example,” Be-
lowich said.
”The team is in good physi-
cal and mental shape for our
last home meet on Saturday
against Ohio State,” said Be-
lowich.
