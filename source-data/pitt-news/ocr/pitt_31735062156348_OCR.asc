Fraternity men have their own -

ideas ‘why membership lists are
onithe decline and ﬁnances are
becdining a problem.

“The draft is affeeting frater-
nity memberships,” is the opin-

ion of» an oﬂicer in one of Pitt’s

_fraternities. This is one of sev-
. eral reasons offered for the short-
ened Greek rolls.

The number of men
fraternity’_’ has been on the
downgrade for nearly the past
three years. In the period fol-

S lowing ‘World War II, fraternity
_rushing lists mounted to a high;
«prospective pledges were practi-
cally knocking down doors in
"their eagerness to be accepted.
Active members had large ﬁelds
from which to choose, and the
choices were. of good quality-.-

enthusiastic men with lots of ‘

‘school spirit. ‘ -
Declined in ‘I950
Then, in 1950, came Korea and

the ,let—down. Rushing l i s t s
. dwindled; from a peak of plenty
' they went into a slow but steady
’decline that has continued into
I the‘present school term.’

_ In some fraternities, where the
loss of .income due to the de-
crease of active members has be-
come ‘a c u t e, a ' retrenchment
policy is in order. Social activi-
ties andofunctions are being cur-

tailed in some houses. In ‘one
house all social functions nor-
mally -held are off.
‘ There was one case reported of
dues» being raised to maintain the
necessary income. With mort-
gages and necessary expenses to
be‘ paid,‘ loss of membership poses
a critical problem when it comes
to breaking even for the year.
Sigma Alpha Epsilon’s vice-
president, Tom Snodgrass, states
that “the main reson- for-the fall-
off is the draft.” Not only is ac-
tual drafting-taking active mem-
bers, but the potential draft has
caused some men ,to decide
against going fraternity.
Cites Cycles
According to’ Forsythe, de-
creasing memberships run in
cycles.‘ There are severalyears
:of drought and sev.eral yearsfof
plenty. The main fault for the
lean years lies in the general let-
down ‘of fraternity men them-
selves. Enthusiasm slackens and
this is-reﬂected. in rushing lists.
The solution, then, is renewed‘
effort on the part of active mem-
bers ‘to bolster ‘sagging fortunes‘
of their respective groups.-
Forsythe cites his fraternity as
an example. The fall term, 1952-
1953, showed a below normal
membership. —By stepping up ef-

By DAVE GREEN‘

Class organization program for men, to be instituted
dean of men’s oflice, is by no means a new

this spring by‘ the
idea. ._ ,

For many years prior to
class organization ‘existed in

ion For Men

World War, II, some sort -of
one form or another.

Originally, University-wide class
oﬂicers were elected.- This system
worked well, until certain blocks
within the school began to~dom-
inate elections. Since there were
more students in the College than
in any other school, most class
oﬁicers came from that group.

Other schools caught on fast
however, and‘ at times, the dental
school and the School of Phar-
macy dominated the oﬂjces.

Plan Dropped Before
,After the University-wide or-
ganization \was scrapped, school
associations were adopted. The
College,” and Schools of Business
Administration,‘ Engineering, and

‘Mines . all had individual organi-
these .

All efforts at class organiiation
were abandoned with the veteran

“The draft is a prevalent fac-
tor,” says Jim Morley of the
Delta Tau Delta. Morley,‘ assist-
ant treasurer of his group, stated
that a loss of approximately 15

~members during the past -three
years includes ﬁve men lost di-
rectly to the draft.

“No,” said Bill Forsythe, Phi
Delta Theta president, “The draft
is not the primary reason for the

v decline. Rather, the draft’ is be-
ing used as a scapegoat. Frater-
nities have not lost too many men
directly to the armed forces, and

_ the potential of being called into
"military service would not deter
those who have the real desire to
belong.” 2 _

Other explanations given are:

ter. - We’ll try to touch on some.

‘By Jim Bender

Fo_r the past few days we’ve‘

been hearing a, lot ‘about the
“Panther” survey on .cheating.
This survey indicated that stu—"
dents, do cheat and to a great
extent. , ‘ S S
The survey was ﬁne, but‘ what
would these same students do if
‘they were going to a school which
operated under ‘a’ different sys-
tem? Suppose we ‘had an honor
system such as the’ one at the
University of Virginia.
’ At Virginia the students are
responsible only to each other.
When a student enters the uni-
versity_he is asked to sign a paper
saying in effect that. he will be
honest in all things while he is
at-the university.’ Some students
think a long while before sign-

ing, but once they enroll theyl
are considered bound by‘, the

honor s_ystem..
Not Foolproof ~

This system isn’t foolproof, but
can it be any worse than the one
wehave now? Instructors at Pitt,
withifew exceptions, will warn
the‘ class before the test that no
cheating will be tolerated. This

seems to be the Wrong approach, V

because it presents a challenge
do the student. The students as-
sume that it is a competitive
game where those with the slick-
est crib notes and ponies will
win. If the instructor sees them
they lose and‘he chalks up”an “F’.’
for the test._ I ' -
Suppose we did have the honor
system at Pitt? What difference

would‘ it make as far as tests’

were concerned? The ﬁrst thing
would beat change in the atti-
tude» of the instructors -toward
the pupil. The air of suspicion

— would disappear. The test would.‘

merely -shownthe instructor that
he and his_ students were ‘both
doing a good job, instead of be-
ing a game where the student
and instructor tried to outsmart
each other.

of the more important things that
made the‘ news at Pitt. -

Good Start .

We‘ started the Fall semester .
* with a successful wooing of Phi

Beta Kappa. After years - of
struggle, the honorary was estab-
lished at Pitt and “another laurel
graced our collective heads. We
were tripped up though when
several groups tried.to bringa
pair of-live panther mascots to
the campus. Pitt liked the idea
but the City Council didn’t. Re-
sult: no.cats.

Guest tickets for .wiVes of stu-
dents received a lot of attention
—"-but that’s all. The dean of
men’s ofﬁce established a .‘work-.
able plan but ‘the Athletic Com-
mittee exercised its veto power.
We stumped for a trip to Miami
for New Years but despite Coach
Dawson and the team, West Vir-
ginia a'nd’Penn State doﬁsed our
hopes and the Orange Bowl bid.
Then forty accrediting profess-

ors came to Pitt ‘and evaluated "us.

We don’t know what the re-
sult was, as yet. ,

Room Dedicated -

With the -help of our British
friends, we ﬁnished and dedi-
cated the English,Room, adding
another stop on thesight-seeing
tour of the Cathedral. The new
Panther Magazines appeared and
.was_ properly ‘received by the
Newman Club but not by the
students,

 

iAFuriny Tinhle.ofl'fhe“    

Men’s Council proposed to‘es— ,

tablish ‘an activity. point rating
scale, but it seems to have died a
quiet, peaceful , death. Inter-

Fraternity Council yielded " to_

pressure and dropped the once-
all-powerful IF Slate for student
government elections. The Com-

Honor, Code 4«As|{e‘d for Pitt ‘ T

 around that topic than almost any other we can think of. _ ' . i _ \i- _
 That‘ there -has been .a noticeable falling off in ’enthusiasr_n~  "- d‘. A C h . ,- T
for (the aims and achievements of the old alma mater is L.‘  e ° 1 , -.  O _

butthereare various_ angles to

be considered there. One _point ‘

is that the system is s'tronger"t,o-

day becauseitfhas been tested"

under ﬁre. Another thing-isv that
most of the West .P_ointers”—who
were dismissed were football

players. The rest were those, who_._’
gave ‘them help. This does , not .7

reﬂect on the honor system, but

on the system of education whigh .

required them ' to maintain a
passing 'avei:agev in a. school which
is noted for its high scholastic
standards and at-thesame time
play football and practice at least
20 hours a week. ‘
True, the men did eheat and
good marks were", necessary to
stay at West Point, but the honor
system didn’t fail, it was the men
who failed." The honor system
still stands at the Point. -

._l.egciI Solution

If we assume that thevhonor

mons Room Christmas Ball came
and went and left many happy
memories and a few favors to
tuck away in our scrapbooks. Red

Cross ofﬁcials appealed’ for life-‘

giving blood for troops in Korea
and Pittites responded on two
occasions with much-appreciated
donations. , ’ _.--’

Plans for a Student Union were
brought up. In our minds wehad
the thing ‘built and going full
blast, and then we were sudden-
ly out in the cold again with no
Union and no more tangible
plans. NSA made a heroic stand
in its desire to enroll Pi‘tt‘,‘~but
once again it was voted down.

Had Our Share _ ‘
So, looking back, we see that
we’ve had our share. of ups and
downs, just like the elevators.
At times we forged ahead and at
times we slid ‘backward on the
ice of indecision. and the oil of
indifference. ‘

It seems, though, that the ‘credit.

side of the ledger carries a little
more weight than the red ink on
the opposite pages.‘ We might
surmise that we have had a fairly
decent and ‘successful school
term up to now.» With
upon us and only three ‘more
months of-school remaining, we
niight begin to lay plans for the
rest of the semester and even look
‘as far ahead as next September.
If this really is a period of mark-
ing time, we have every oppor-
tunity to do this.

,Maybe we should take. a last
puﬁ onthe cigarette, drain the
glass, or get up off the locker
room bench. I_t’s a funny time or
the year,_ you know, but it doesn’t
last ‘long. '

Tallyho!'

>0

Be Honest

system did come to Pitt, we must
also face the practical question
of what to do if someone ,\v'o_uld

“cheat. Perhaps the‘ best answer

. is to_lo'ok at the laws made by

the different levels of govern-

“merit.

These'laws_ can do nothing
themselves.‘ They rnuste‘ be en-
forced, but just because a‘_}.few

. break a,1a‘w does not mean the’
law shoyld. beabandoned. The

methods .of enforcement in the
case" of the honor system would
have to be worked out, but there
aremany patterns to work from.

The problem is not so much ‘

what the other fellow is going
to do as what you yourself are
going to do. Without the help and
support of the students; the ‘honor

~ system would ‘be afailure, but if
it succeeded it would mea1i.J

this grid squad at Trees Field Apr. 7 for the ﬁrst day of
spring drills he will re-mobilized his\platoons into a single. '

The metamorphosis must be completed within a 30 day
period‘ in which the" NCAA‘ ruling allows only 20 practice

sessions. This year, ‘however,

problems, .(1) ﬁnding their most
talented athletes ‘who can play
both offense and defense, and,
(2) ﬁlling gaps’ sprung open by
graduation losses. - 4

Dawson, beginning his second_
year at the helm, certainly has
enoughlof both.

Middle Wall Weak

With 58 to 60 varsity and frosh

candidates expected to report for

the itch,”. Dawson is chieﬂy con-‘
berned with rebuilding his middle
wall and reshufﬂing his backﬁeld‘
combinations. B _

“We’ll . str ess fundamentals
again,” the Redhead explained
Monday, “and try ‘to ﬁnd out
which players can go both ways.”
Graduation hit us hardest on«the
line (Pitt lost nine) and ’we’ll have
to see if the defensive players
who are available can perform
on offense, too.”

In 'the backﬁeld Dawson an-
nounced that Billy Hoifman, regu-
lar left halfback last fall, will be
switched to the important“quarter-
back slot. _I-Ioﬁman’s ability as a
passer wasdisplayed last year but
the sophomore from Greensburg
is regarded an excellent defensive
halfback and good kicker."

All -Students * Invited

coaches all over the country

will include Rudy nMattioli, Henry
Ford, and Pete Neft.
Dawson made it clear, however,

   

  

. Hoffman. Dawson

that all students are "invited" to

test their skills at spring drills.
“_If they can help us,” he said,
“we’l1-be glad to see _them out
there.” -

Plans are now in full swing to
line? up ex-varsity gridders for
the third annual Old Timers game
scheduled at the Stadium for
May 9. The alumni squad usually
draws its strength from the pre-

vious team’s graduating members.

Ed Christner, a freshman in the

He bounced his opponent to- the tune 20-8 and the crowd- re-

 

« sporided with a most resounding blast. Afterwards, Homan told

friends that ‘ﬁheénever knew what hit him when Peery got ﬁnished.”_

' But through it all Peery was seriously at work, not very at-
tentive to his approving audience. Charlie Uram, the 157-pound
cutie, made an entirely different impression on the house. Uram
and his foe, Doug _Frey, -continually kept their hands in motion}

he sported a goatee. It wasn’t necessary to retain his strength, but .

Solomon delighted in carrying the thing around. He babied the

goatee until Coach Rex Peery demanded that it be ‘removed before
the ﬁrst match. _ , '
What many fans don’t know about Solomon is that early

in the year he was bothered by a badly sprained ankle that .
-made work on the mats very difficult. Despite this injury -he
continued his practice drills until Peery just about forced the
powerful sophomore, to get it x-rayed and rest up for the com-

ing season. ' ' 1
