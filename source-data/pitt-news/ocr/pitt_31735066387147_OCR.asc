Survey shows students aware of cheating on campu

For The Pitt News

More than 81 percent of Pitt
undergraduates surveyed recent-
ly said they have witnessed
cheating, and 55 percent have
personally cheated while attend-
ing Pitt.

The survey, conducted by a
Pitt Newspaper I journalism
class, was distributed to 500 stu-
dents and posed 12 questions.

Conducted over a two-week
period in March, the survey
included undergrads from all
schools and class levels, and an
attempt was made to collect a
sample representative of the
undergraduate population as a
whole. The students surveyed
do not constitute a randomly
selected sample of Pitt under-
graduate students. _

Students who witnessed
cheating said they saw cheating
on in-class quizzes, tests and
final exams. Respondents said
they were also aware of other
students buying and reusing
papers, copying homework and
plagiarizing. 6

Students said parental or com-
petitive pressure contributed to

their cheating; 66 percent said
they consider it easy to cheat at
Pitt.

Respondents disagreed about
whether or not certain campus
organizations and athletic teams
have an unfair advantage on
exams and classwork.

One male student said that fra-
ternities and sororities will help
each other out, and athletes are
only here to play. Several stu-
dents mentioned files containing
old exams and papers kept by
fraternities and sororities.

Others said they felt tutors
gave athletes help unavailable to
other students. But other stu-
dents disagreed, saying all stu-
dents have the same opportuni-
ties to get help with their work.
One student added that athletes
need tutors because of their
busy schedules.

Large classrooms and lecture

halls, some of which can seat up ,

to 400 students in some intro-
ductory classes, are a factor
behind cheating, according to
many survey respondents.

The class also distributed sur-
veys to approximately 1,000 fac-
ulty members; 65 professors
responded. Those professors
agreed that large classrooms
facilitate cheating; 45 mentioned
this as a factor that made cheat-

Students innovative with cheating

By Tawnya Adams
For The Pitt News

“Once I wrote on my thighs
and wore a miniskirt,” a Pitt
junior said. “I figured that if a
teacher or a proctor saw me, he
would be too embarrassed to
ask me to lift my skirt to prove

that I actually had something
written on my legs. If he did
ask, I would just refuse. It
worked!” ~
This is just one example of
many of the creative stories stu-
dents told about cheating.
During follow-up interviews of
the cheating surveys conducted

by a Pitt journalism class, stu-
dents and professors explained
what they have seen and actual-
ly done.

cheating.

Just minutes after members of Students

decided to leave the sheltering canopy of
the department store shielding them from
the rain and began marching through the
downtown streets to speak out against
fur, the clouds dispelled and rays from
the sun streaked the sidewalks, prompt-
ing some to wonder if Mother Nature was
showing her support.

of Student Affairs.

The proposal was initiated in 1983 by
Kenneth Metz, currently the dean of the
School of Education.

“We are looking for some way to bal-
ance athletics and intramurals at Pitt,”
Golden said.

“This would be an improvement
because Student Affairs has said they
would make the intramural program a
priority.”

He said the intramural program is
struggling due to budget cuts in recent
years, cuts made despite increased par-
ticipation and the need for more refer-

Animal Passion, a local animal rights

The participants, carrying signs which
shouted “Fur is Dead” and “Fur, the look
that kills,” had to struggle dragging along
a coffin and several mangled fur coats
while serving as a voice for the animals.

Stares were constant, as Well as Com-

E-IT-gineering speaker

discusses facets of job

By Travis Senseny
Staff Writer

Internationally known struc-
tural engineer William J.
LeMessurier delivered the annu-
al Landis Lectureship on Friday
in the Graduate School of Public
Health auditorium.

LeMessurier, who is a Harvard
and Massachusetts Institute of
Technology graduate, delivered
two addresses to University of
Pittsburgh engineering students
and faculty.

In the morning, he spoke
about “Engineering in the Real
World,” and the afternoon topic
was “Engineering and
Architecture.”

The Department of Civil and
Environmental Engineering insti-
tuted the Landis Lectureship in
1991 to honor a 1952 graduate
of Pitt, Donald H. Landis.

To become a Landis Lecturer,
one must be nationally recog-
nized in engineering, at the fore-
front of their field, and have
good speaking ability.

LeMessurier is known for his
innovative engineering Ventures.
He is the inventor of the stag-
gered truss system which is now
commonly used in hotels and
apartment buildings.

He designed the Citicorp
Center in New York City, the
Treasury Building in Singapore
and the Air and Space Museum
in Washington, D.C.

Another contribution
LeMessurier has made is control-
ling wind-induced motion in tall
buildings by developing the
concept of the tuned mass
damper. His corrections “fixed”
the John Hancock Building.

During his lecture on
“Engineering and Architecture,”
LeMessuier showed slides of the
buildings he worked on and of
buildings he said he felt were
particularly interesting.

, The lecture dealt strictly with
skyscrapers. LeMessurier said,
“Tall buildings pose many chal-
lenges.” One of the challenges
that LeMessurier pointed out

State senator urges
OMFC to get involved

By Jennifer McGinnis
Staff‘ Writer

Pennsylvania state Senator
Melissa Hart urged the
Organization for Minority
and Female Conservatives to
stand up for their beliefs and
take action on campus.

“The only way to do it is to
do it. Get out there and
speak your mind,” Hart told
club members in a speech at
the group’s final meeting
Thursday.

Hart said she agreed to
come and speak to the
group, despite the university
not being part of her district,
because she thought, “this
group sounds like a group of
young people who are
thinking.”

Hart told the group that
she was a “sacrificial lamb”
candidate when she first ran
for the Senate. She was 28
and had only been out of

Pitt’s School of Law for three
years when she ran against a
52-year-old incumbent.

She said she ran into many
problems raising campaign
funds because she was a
conservative.

Hart cited being denied
support by an organization
called Emily’s List, which
gives funding to women can-
didates, as one of the dis-
heartening times in her
career.

Several groups like Emily’s
List had expressed interest in
helping her campaign until
she responded to their sur-
veys. “After the surveys I got
a lot of letters saying, ‘Sorry,
you’re really not a woman,

you’re a conservative,” Hart 9

said.

Hart managed to Win the
election with 51 percent of
the vote. “It wasn’t the
money that won the cam-

Tower A gatekeeper gives friendsb

By Christian Gatti
For The Pitt News

He was recently part of the
footage in a documentary on
campus security and appeared
in the credits as “the funny,
friendly, smiley man.”

“I like kids, especially
teenagers,” said Bob Balaski,
one of the Pinkerton Security
guards who is responsible for
the welfare of students at the
University of Pittsburgh.

“We are very serious about
the welfare of students,” he said.

He is the gatekeeper of the
Tower A residence hall. He
grants students entrance to their
residence hall upon verification
of identification and their resi-
dence.

But he is more then that, stu-
dents say he is a caring and

_ smiling face wishing them the

best of days every day.

One student said she sees
Balaski as “the gatekeeper of
happiness.”

“Some think I’m nuts saying,
‘Hi!’ to everybody and always
smiling and all that stuff. I
agreed with them for a while,”
Balaski said.

Balaski agreed, that is, until he
received a card in the mail from
a graduate student thanking him
for making her mornings and
clays happy at Pitt.

“Things like that make me feel
like I’m doing something worth-
while. Makes me feel like I’m
doing good; I hope I am,” he
said.

Balaski said things like that
keep him going and are why he
has kept his job for so long. The
60 year old has been smiling
from behind his booth for the
last 20 years.

Students flash their ID cards
on which is slapped a gold
‘Tower A 1994’ sticker.

Balaski flashes a smile and a
warm greeting from his win-
dowed booth and welcomes
them home.

His informal responsibility is
to “make people happy.

“It’s part of the job.

“For most students this is their
first time away from home,” he
said, “I just want to give them
someone to talk to. I like to pick
out the loneliest, the ones usual-
ly by themselves.”

Balaski said he enjoys inter-
acting with people, especially
with teenagers. He said he
enjoys watching them grow and
mature.

“I enjoy watching students
progress as freshmen, graduate
and change,” he said.

His formal responsibility is to
not allow any unauthorized per-
sons into the residence halls.

“We are very strict about this,”
he said.

As a security guard he is
required to protect students, but
Balaski said he has to protect
them sometimes from them-
selves.

He said he helps students by
providing needed information
and even counseling, or in any
way that he can.

Tower A gatekeeper Bob Balaski always has a smile for Tower A residents as they come and

go. ~
“In today’s world there is so
much stress. Students’ problems
are huge, or so they think,” he
said. Balaski said that his smiling
self is there to relieve that stress.

Balaski began as a Pitt securi-
ty guard 20 years ago as a sec-
ond job to his occupation as a
salesman. He has always loved
interacting with people.

For those 20 years his favorite
aspect of security has been the
same — “kids’ happiness.”

He said that things haven’t
changed much and that “kids

ing more likely. Faculty
members also noted that
overcrowded small class-
rooms make it difficult to
preventcheating.

One CAS professor said he
despairs when teaching a
class of 100 students or more
in one of the smaller lecture
halls.

“There’s no way I can sep-
arate them sufficiently,” the
professor said. “Even if [stu-
dents] have no intention, it’s
very difficult not to see
papers of other students.”

Other professors men-
tioned careless proctoring or
test preparation as factors in
cheating. Most agreed that
certain types of exams, par-
ticularly multiple choice and
scan-tron, make cheating eas-
ier. Three faculty members
cited instructors’ attitudes as
an influence in whether stu-
dents cheat.

Thirty-five of the 65 faculty
respondents said they had
witnessed cheating during

their time at Pitt. Of those 35,
two had pursued disciplinary
action against students
through an academic integri-
ty hearing. Seven faculty
members had sent letters to
the deans of their schools,
informing them about stu-
dents who were caught
cheating.

Most faculty apparently
handle cheating incidents at
the classroom level, giving
failing grades or other sanc-
tions, but it appears that not
all follow university guide-
lines and inform deans of
their actions.

One administrator was sur-
prised when told of the sur-
vey results.

“I don’t believe that that
many people are cheating, “
said Jack Daniel, vice—provost
for academic affairs at the
university. “But I’m sure
some cheating has taken
place.”

Techniques

Continued from page 1
their friends all had the same
class, but never went to it
that much. So they paid
someone to go to the first
testing time for the final —
there were three times you
could take it — and steal a copy
for them. The kid they hired
actually took the test using a
fake name and Social Security
number! He then brought a
copy back with him, they fig-
ured out all the answers and
proceeded to take the exam the
next day without any prob-
lems.”

Not only have students paid
people to get exams for them,
but they have brought in exams
from previous semesters while
they were taking a test.

“I brought in an exam once to
an English class. It was a big
class,and four other guys and I
sat in the back and passed back
and forth an old midterm. It was

 

the same exam as the semester
before,” Rick, a former swim-
mer, said.

There are many reasons and
many ways students cheat
at the University of Pitts-
burgh. Michelle, a CAS sopho-
more, cheated because she had
a class that she didn’t want to
take but had to.

“I had a class that I hated, but
it was a requirement. Out of
desperation, I stole a copy of
the test when I went to my pro-
fessor’s office to schedule an
appointment with her about
whether or not I should drop
the class.”

An elaborate case of cheating
was described by an assistant
professor in CAS. Julie called
the teacher and said she didn’t
get a grade on her test. Julie
asked Sara, a student in
her class, to see the test.
Julie then erased Sara’s name
and replaced it with her own

and turned this into the profes-
sor.

The professor gave Julie the
grade which was actually Sara’s
grade, and didn’t realize this
wasn’t Julie’s test. Julie then
erased her name and put Sara’s
back on the test. It was ques-
tioned when Sara saw that her
name wasn’t written in her own
handwriting. .

She told the professor, and
Julie was asked to bring in the
original copy of her test. She
had gotten a blank test, filled in
the answers and marked it with
different color pens because
she knew the TA’s marked tests
this way.

When the professor showed
the test to the TA’s, they all
said the handwriting was
not theirs. Julie didn’t actually
admit to doing all of this,
but she did sign a paper that
said she would just fail the
class.

ingly referred to New York’s
Sixth Avenue, where many of
the buildings were built in the
‘60s, as “Sick Avenue.”

He called the Sears Tower,
which is the tallest building the
world, “gloomy—1ooking and not
as interesting as some skyscrap-

engineering.”

He showed pictures of the
buildings he designed as well as
the technical designs of those
buildings. LeMessurier is the

paign, it was grass roots,” she
said

Being a woman also gave
Hart some extra challenges with
which to deal. She said when
she and her male colleagues
were discussing which senate
committees would be the best
for her to work on, they
suggested the Urban Affairs
and Housing Committee or
the Aging and Youth
Committee.

She said they thought these
would be good committees for
a woman to work on because
helping old people, babies and
homeless people are kind of

warm and fuzzy issues. “No one
suggested the Finance
Committee, which was what I
really wanted to do.”

Hart convinced them she
would be good for the Finance
Committee and is currently the
majority chair of that commit-
tee.

Hart focused on encouraging
OMFC members to become
active.

“The setting of the university
often is not as free-thinking as it
should be,” Hart said. “This
[group] is the way revolutions
start.”

Hart told the group not to
give up in their fight against the



Women’s Studies program,
which currently is only a certifi-
cate program at Pitt.
According to Megan
Cortazzio of OMFC, the group
opposes the extremely liberal
stance of the Women’s Studies
program. The group is con-
cerned about the inclusion of
pro-choice speakers and litera-
ture, and lesbian comedians in

\X/omen’s Studies courses,
Cortazzio said.
Cortazzio urged any

concerned students to attend
a meeting about the \Women’s
Studies program at noon
Monday in the William Pitt
Union's Kurtzman Room.

The working group, which
included representatives from
the provost’s office, School
of Education, Student Affairs
and the Athletic Department
met on Friday to discuss many
issues, just one of which was
looking at Pitt's facilities in rela-
tion to other schools’.
According to a USA Today
article presented at the meeting,
several universities around the
country have constructed recre-
ation centers to improve the
quality of life for students. The

article said recreational facilities
are one of the top reasons that
students choose a particular col-
lege.

Nathan Hershey, a professor
of health law, also attended
the meeting. In a letter
addressed to the Senate Athletic
Committee Chair, he urged the
administration to follow
through with plans to make
recreational facilities available
to “the overwhelming majority
of Pitt students who do not par-
ticipate in intercollegiate
sports.”

Hershey also noted the

fact that private health clubs
target students by pointing
to the excessive demand
for the facilities at Trees
Hall.

“The administration is work-
ing hard to plan facilities,”
Wuertele said. “The biggest
problem at this point is funding
to make [facilities] become a
reality.”

According to a draft by the
intramural and recreational
facilities working group, headed
by John Bolvin of the provost’s
office, there has only been one
major addition to athletic facili-

ties at Pitt since 1963. During
this time period, however,
enrollment has increased by
approximately 10,000 while fac-
ulty and staff have increased by
4,000.

The draft proposed several
steps which it stated should
immediately be taken by the
university. The transfer of intra-
murals to Student Affairs is one
of these items.

“[Education and Student
Affairs] would basically share
the expense,” Golden said, due
to the fact that education will
still be conducting sports class-
es.

“We are also looking into
forming a club sports program
within Student Affairs.”

Another item considered
deserving of immediate atten-
tion was increased security at
Trees Hall.

According to Golden, there
are times when there is no secu-
rity person at the front door of
Trees Hall, leaving the facility
open to individuals not permit-
ted to use it.

Other future considerations

H  THE PITT NEWS: Monday, Agril 18: 1994

included an enlargement of the
weight room in Trees Hall,
more suitable carpeting in the
Charles L. Cost Sports Center,
creation of outdoor tennis
courts and the overall improve-
ment of Trees Hall.

“It seems like half of Trees
isn’t being used,” Golden said.
“There needs to be money bud-
geted to make facilities avail-
able to all students.”

Due to the debt of the current
intramural program, Golden
said the Trees pool is in danger
of being closed in May.

The athletic facilities working
group, of which Wuertele is a
member, is looking to upgrade
the women’s pool locker room
in Trees.

“Right now it is at the point
where women are changing [in
lower campus] and then coming
here because the locker rooms
in Trees are so poor,” Wuertele
said.

Both Wuertele and Golden
said no action could be
taken on the proposals until
approved by senior administra-
tion.

Security yes, police state no

Public housing security could become a cross
between that of airports and Pitt residence halls with a
few extra goodies thrown in if the Clinton administra-
tion has its way. In light of the transformation of many
housing projects into virtual arms depots as a result of
gang warfare, Clinton has called for a series of steps to
help remove weapons from public housing units.

Housing and Urban Development Secretary Henry
Cisneros has set forth five steps which officials in large
cities could take to help control the problem.

The first step would be to put armed police and
metal detectors at project entrances in order to control
the common areas of the buildings, thus controlling the
ﬂow of weaponry in and out of the projects.

The next step would be to erect fences around the
housing facilities, which has been shown to cut crime
by 40 percent in those areas (Post—Gazette). This would
be a benign step which should be encouraged in all
such areas to protect residents.

Third, Cisneros wants the police to conduct weapon
searches in places such as the stairwells of buildings.
The police would be well within their bounds to search
such common areas, thereby increasing police pres-
ence and making it more difficult for criminals to
exploit areas which should be reserved for tenants.

The last two proposals in Cisneros’ plan are question-
able in that they could easily lead to an abuse of
power on the part of police officers.

According to these proposals, the police would be

allowed to frisk those labeled as “suspicious—looking
people.” While the Supreme Court has said in the past
that police can search a person whom they believe has
ggeiguipygslvgvciuirévaclcrigne, the Supreme Court will not
be looking over eve officers sliotiltier in the hallways
of housing projects across the country. Although not
every officer is inherently abusive and fascistic, one
need only look at recent events on this campus to see
that abuses of power aren’t limited strictly to poorer
neighborhoods.

The last proposal borders on being overtly draconian.
It asks tenants to sign consent forms which would
allow police officers to search for weapons. The ten-
ants of public housing projects must allow periodic
maintenance inspections, and according to Cisneros,
the tenants might be persuaded to allow the police to
search their home to get rid of drugs and weapons.
These forms would give police officers carte blanche to
conduct random searches in_ homes. Essentially, this
measure would throw out the Fourth Amendment of
the Constitution, which protects all citizens against ille-
gal search and seizure. »

While crime is a serious problem, the price for safe

‘homes and streets should not be a police state.

Never forget to check your hair

During these final hectic weeks of classes this
term, I want to give a big piece of advice to

every busy student. Before you walk out the

door of your house, dorm room, apartment,
cardboard box or whatever you live in, before
you come outside to greet the world with new
vigor, ready to take on all the challenges of a
stressful, successful day, remember to check
your hair. I realized this the other day when, so
consumed with all my appointments and class-
work and that other stuff I had to do, I almost
walked out of the house without rinsing the
€’dfl’(llt1’o‘i’1ef out of my hair.

It can happen so easily. One minute you are
in the shower. The water strikes your skin. You
start massaging your hair, wetting it down and
lathering it up with a squirt of shampoo. You
rinse out the shampoo and as it streams toward
the floor of the tub, you run a

has not cleared yet, and you only have $3.68 to
last through the week. You realize you have
more to do than you may be able to handle.

You fumble to get dressed when you look
down to see the shirt you are putting on has a
big bleach stain on the front, and all your other
clothes are dirty. You were supposed to do
laundry last weekend, but you went to the
library instead to get a jump on your studying.
Your stomach starts to growl, and when you go
to find that one slice of bread you were saving
to eat for breakfast this morning, you discover
that time has taken its toll and all you have left
is a source of penicillin.

You consider running down the street to some
fast-food place on the way to class, but that idea
fades when you get out to your car and find that
your gas gauge is on Empty. You might have
handled that had that parking

tioner through your hair, gently
pulling your fingers up from the

ticket not been on the wind-
shield.

You begin to question yourself.
Why did you get this ticket, you
ask. Because you forgot to move
the car before the street cleaner

lather trails around your neck
and behind your ears. While you
twist your body around under the rain-like
spurts from the shower nozzle above, the soap
suds follow the way of the shampoo. You feel
as if you are washing away all the tension from
your head and shoulders, across your back and
over your body through your arms and legs and
out your fingers and toes and down the drain.
You relax and let the warm water wash over
you. You begin to feel clean and refreshed -
suddenly rejuvenated. Once your mind clears,
you begin to examine all the things on your
agenda for the day, mentally planning and orga-
nizing each task, while looking for some time to
have fun. One at a time you are hit with more
items for that “T 0 Do Today” list. You remember
you haveto go to archaeology, physics lab and
political science, and then you have to write that
paper that was due yesterday in philosophy.
You have a doctor’s appointment at 2, a study

‘ group meeting at 3 and a job interview at 5:45.

As you towel off, you hear the phone ring. It’s
your mother calling to say you never call her
any more, she misses you and she will be com-
ing down to visit you this weekend. Minutes
later, while you’re in the closet in your under-
wear, your boy/girlfriend also calls to inform
you that he/she is going out with his/her friends
this evening, and that you are not invited. So
now, in your jealous fury you must come up
with a way to even the score. Then you realize
that you cannot afford to get even because that
last check you deposited into your bank account

came, you answer. Why didn’t
you move the car on time?
Because you have too much on your mind. Why
did you park there? It all comes rushing back.
You were just planning to run in for a quick
change of clothes and then back to the library.
But you turned on the television for important
news, weather and mindless background noise
while you were getting dressed. Then you start-
ed watching that show with that guy and forgot
the time.

You try to justify your irresponsible behavior
by telling yourself you hate the library. You
recall the last time when you spent six hours
searching for books to complete your research
paper and only found three.

And those three books were missing the pages
you neededbecause they were ripped out by
the student who had the same topic last semes-
ter. You get so frustrated that you just want to
give up, go back inside, eat large quantities of
chocolate and hide under the covers until the
term ends. If this sounds like what your are
going through, you are not the first. It’s hard to
cope with all these deadlines, finals, appoint-
ments, arguments with our family and friends
and other everyday stress and strain. I realize
you have enough to worry about already.

So take my advice and please — just remem-
ber to check your hair before you go. Because if
you leave home without rinsing the conditioner
from your hair, people will notice, and your
whole day will be ruined.

Pitt baseball loses first BE game

Panthers lose to West Virginia on Friday, first Big East game to Georgetown yesterday,9—7

By Sean Duncan
Staff Writer

The inevitable fina_lly hap-
pened: the Pitt baseball team
lost a Big East game.

After Pitt ripped Georgetown
15-5 in the first game, the
Panthers plummeted in the fol-
lowing game, 9-7. Pitt wrapped
up the weekend three-game
series at Trees Field by winning
11-8, as they upped their Big
East record to 11-1.

“Georgetown is a little
tougher for us because we
know that we should beat
them,” head coach Mark
Jackson said. “We make mis-
takes that we normally don’t
make, [as] opposed to playing
better teams when we know we
have to make the plays. It’s a
whole different mental outlook.

“We didn’t play very well at
all.”

Georgetown erased a five—run
deficit with a lot of help from
Panther pitching in the second
game. “Starter T edde Campbell
and Clayton Beirne coupled to

ing walking in the winning run

13-11 loss
to West Va.

Staﬂ‘ Writer

The Pitt men’s lacrosse team
lost what now seems to have
been the most important and
decisive game of the season 15-
11 last Thursday night against
West Virginia University at Pitt
Stadium.

Going into Thursday’s game
with a 12-1 overall record, and a
6-1 division record, the Panthers
were facing a do—or-die situa-
tion. A win would guarantee
them a spot in the playoffs, and
a loss would mean that their
fate would rest in V/VU’s hands
and would depend on how the
Mountaineers ended their regu-
lar season.

The game started out with
WVU getting the first goal, but
following that Pitt got on track
and took over the game.

However, WVU still
remained within striking
distance.

and two hits later, the Panthers
were once again in the driver’s

The Hoyas retaliated _with
three runs of their own in the
second. After Campbell walked
two batters, right fielder John
Halladay doubled them both
home. Mark Medwig then dou-
bled in Halladay.

innings to take a 7-3 lead — but

Ryan betters Fit

By Stephen Flinn
Staff Writer

This year’s Blue-Gold game
provided some exciting
moments as the Gold team,
led by offensive line coach
Jack Henry, defeated the Blue
team, led by offensive coordi-
nator Ken Karcher, by the nar-
row score of 14-13, as head
coach Johnny Majors looked
on from the upstairs press
box. ‘

One of “the focal points of
the game was the quarterback
situation, as the Gold team
was led mostly by junior col-
lege transfer Sean Fitzgerald,
while the Blue team split quar-
terbacking duties evenly
between John Ryan and Pete
Gonzalez.

“The quarterback situation
still looks close,” Majors said.
“I thought all three definitely
made progress today.”

Ryan, last year’s starting
quarterback, led all passers,
completing 14 of 22 attempts
for 154 yards. Fitzgerald com-
pleted 15 of 20 attempts for
135 yards, including one
touchdown and one intercep-
tion. Gonzalez completed

that would be the end of their
offense.

“Our offense was a little ﬂat,
but you’re not going to go out
and score 30 runs in three
games,” right hander Gregg
Mrochko said.

In the fifth inning
Georgetown started to chisel
away at the lead with a two-run
homer by Roy DeCaro. Then in
the sixth, Pitt would finally
crumble.

Beirne relieved Campbell

man, an error and two hits later
the Hoyas were up for good.

Georgetown scored one more
for good measure in the seventh
when a runner scored on
Beirne’s wild pitch.

“It would’ve been nice to go
undefeated, but everybody was
thinking in reality and we
weren’t going to,” third base-
man Josh Tyler said. “But if we
were going to lose, we wanted
to lose because the other team

yards, throwing two touch-
downs and two interceptions.
Billy Davis from the Blue
team led all receivers, with
eight catches for 135 yards and
one touchdown. Dietrich Jells
was the leading receiver for
the Gold team. Jells, back
from knee surgery which
shortened his season last year,
seemed healthy, catching four
passes for 60 yards, including
one touchdown.
The receivers outdid the

runners in total offense, as the

run game was stymied on both
sides. Tim Collichio, also play-
ing for the Gold, and also
returning from an injuiy-rid-
dled season, led all rushers
with 48 yards on 14 attempts,
including one touchdown.
Transfer Dan Greene led the
Blue rushers with 36 yards on
10 attempts.

The run defense swarmed
through the entire game. The
run pursuit was excellent, as
most runs from scrimmage
were stopped for either no
gain or short yardage, which
helped to contribute to the
low score of the contest.

Pitt baseball firzdsformula for losing.’ ll/61]/6S and errors

 

By Scott Keppel
Staff‘ Writer

On a cool and breezy week-
end, the Pitt Panthers took two
of three games from their Big
East rival Georgetown.

After dumping the Hoyas 15-5
on Saturday, the Panthers
would battle the Hoyas in two
games on Sunday that would
not end with a dramatic game-
winning homer or a game-sav-
ing catch. These two games
would end by the result of
walks.

Panther hurler Tedde
Campbell pitched five solid
innings in Sunday’s first game,
giving up seven hits and six
earned runs while striking out
four and walking six. After giv-
ing up a single to open up the
sixth inning, Panther head

coach Mark Jackson replaced
Campbell with Clayton Beirne,
who gave up two more runs
and walked two batters before
striking out Hoya shortstop
Roger Harrington to end the
inning.

The seventh and last inning
started on the wrong foot for
the. Panthers, as Beime walked
leadoff hitter John Halladay.
The next batter, Hoya catcher
Mark Medwig, capitalized by
hitting a run-scoring double,
giving the Hoyas a 9-7 lead and
handing Coach Jackson and the
Panthers their first Big East loss
of the season.

“If we were going to lose we
wanted the other team to beat
us and today we beat our-
selves,” Panther third baseman
Josh Tyler said about the disap-
pointment in losing to

Georgetown.

The final numbers on Beirne:
two innings pitched, two hits,
three earned runs, four strike-
outs and four walks.

Game two of the doublehead-
er saw more walks and errors.
The Panthers led 6-3 entering

lgaeeﬂaéé

the top of the seventh inning.
After recording two quick outs,
Panther pitcher Brian Shaffer
saw his defense crumble,
accounting for three errors and
three unearned runs as the
Hoyas managed to climb back

  

in the game, tying at 6-6.

After the Panthers were
retired to end the seventh
inning, it was time for G—Town
to do some more damage to
Shaffer. After walking the lead-
off batter, Shaffer struck out the
next batter, but gave up a two—
run blast to Hoya right fielder
John Halladay. Jamie Goettler
replaced Shaffer and retired the
next two batters., but G-Town
was now in command, leading
8-6 entering the bottom of the
eighth inning.

Pitt would respond, however.
After Hoya pitcher Brian O’Hare
got DeBemardis to line out, he
showed signs of fatigue and
began to lose his control, walk-
ing the next two batters,
Womelsdorf and Gonzalez.
Miller then singled to load the

Solid quarterback battle is one result of successful spring

By Stephen Flinn
Staff‘ Writer.

Now that the spring practice
season is over for Pitt’s football
team, where do the Panthers
stand, and what can be expect-
ed of Pitt’s football team next
year? This question is best
answered by head coach
Johnny Majors:

“Our leadership and disci-
pline has improved, and knowl-
edge of the system has
improved,” Majors said.

How important is this thing
called the system? Offensive
lineman Reuben Brown feels it
is extremely important. A

“You always hear a lot about
the system this or the system
that, but knowing the system is
very important,” Brown said.
“Last year we were too busy try-
ing to learn the system and
didn’t have time to improve. We
were spending all our time just
getting comfortable with the
system.”

There exists a solid quarter-
back battle between three con-

tenders right now: last year’s
starter, john Ryan; junior col-
lege transfer Sean Fitzgerald;
and redshirt freshman Pete
Gonzalez. Majors credits
Fitzgerald’s excellent progress
as a result of his ability to learn
the system.

“Fitzgerald has made tremen-
dous strides in only 15 prac-
tices,” Majors said. “I am very
pleased with his ability in spring
practice to learn the system.”

One reason Fitzgerald chose
Pitt was because of the system.

“I like offensively what Pitt
does. I like the coaches, includ-
ing Ken Karcher, and I like their
system.”

Is better knowledge of the
system all we have to look for-
ward to from the Panther foot-
ball squad next year?

“I’m very pleased with the
attitude of the team and the
effort,” Majors said. “We have
good effort overall and we have
improved our discipline consid-
erably.”

But after this season’s spring
drills, Majors still feels many

Defensive lineman Tim
Robbins and linebacker Myles
Davis, both playing for the
Blue, led all tacklers with seven
each. Defensive back Jim
Williams, also of the Blue team,
recorded six tackles.

Defensive backs Curtis
McGhee and Michael Reece led

‘the Gold defenders with six

tackles each. Linebacker John
McCray and defensive line-
man/Notre Dame transfer Tyler
Young recorded five tackles
each for the Gold, including
three quarterback sacksfor
Young.

“We have to improve our pass
protection, without question,”
Majors said after the game.

Sean Fitzgerald completed his
first attempt for the Gold, a 13-
yard strike to tight end Allen
Katsock to start the game. After
Gold’s second play, a Fitzgerald
run for 17 yards, it seemed as if
the intra-squad exhibition game
was going to be a wide—open
scoring fest, with the last team
to score being the winner. That
would not be the case, howev-
er, as both teams’ defense
would control the tempo for the
remainder of the low-scoring
contest. .

The battle raged scoreless
through the first quarter as the
Panthers were clearly playing
with a great deal of enthusiasm
and tenacity. It made no differ-
ence that they were blocking
and tackling each other. The
players on Saturday were hitting
as if they were lining up against
Penn State or Notre Dame.

Pete Gonzalez relieved Ryan
at quarterback for the Blue team
about midway through the sec-
ond quarter and piloted the best
offensive series of the game up
to that point. Gonzalez guided
the offense on a 13-play, 81-
yard drive from the Blues own
19 to score the first points of the
game.

The drive was highlighted by
a 27-yard completion by
Gonzalez to Billy Davis on the
second play, which advanced
the Blue from its own 20-yard
line to its 47. The drive culmi-
nated in a four-yard pass
dumped from Gonzalez to
receiver Curtis Anderson for the
touchdown. Kicker Steve
Kalmanides converted the extra
point to put the Blue ahead 7-O.

Following the ensuing kick-
off, the Gold team answered
right back with a score of its
own. Fitzgerald guided the Gold
to a six-play, 67-yard touch-
down drive of its own, high-
lighted by a 27-yard completion
from Fitzgerald to receiver Jay
Jones, which moved the ball
from the Blue 40-yard line
down to the Blue 13-yard line.
The Gold's first scoring- drive
was capped by a 12-yard touch-
down pass from Fitzgerald to
Jells. The Kalminides extra point
finished the first—half scoring
with the score tied 7-7.

The second half progressed
similarly to the first half, with
both defenses bending but not
breaking, as key defensive plays
contributed to a scoreless third
quarter.

only one touchdown in the
fourth quarter, with the decid-
ing factor in the game being
Blue’s attempt for the two-point
conversion (and the win) drop-
ping short with less than one

minute remaining.

The Gold scored its second
touchdown on the best drive of
the day, an 85-yard, 10-play
drive led by Fitzgerald-, which
began shortly after the halfway
mark of the fourth quarter. The
Gold’s go-ahead drive was high-
lighted by a 17-yard bullet from
Fitzgerald, as he rolled to his
right and completed the pass to
receiver Jim Santimauro near
the sidelines at the Blue 27-yard
line.

The Gold drive was capped
off by a ‘nifty 10-yard touch-
down run up the middle by
Collichio. A Kalmanides conver-
sion made the score 14-7 in
favor of the Gold with only a
minute-and—a-half left in the
game.

It seemed as if the Blue team
was sunk, but with less than a

minute to go, Gonzalez hurled a
Hail Mary pass towards the far
sidelines from his own 33-yard
line. The ball was tipped by two
Gold defenders into the waiting
arms of Blue receiver Davis,
who scampered up the sidelines
pulled his team to within one.

Someone in the pressbox
screamed to Coach Majors,
“Well, Coach, it looks as if the
game will end in a tie.”

Majors replied, “Heck no! 9

We’re going for two!”

That is exactly what the Blue
team did, but Gonzalez’s pass
attempt was incomplete.

The Blue did manage one
more chance, as Dan Greene
recovered an on-sides kick for
the Blue on the ensuing kickoff,
but the game ended when Gold
defender Gerald Simpson inter-
cepted the ball in the ensuing
series as time ran out.

Almost every player on the
field saw action, with only
injuries causing some players
not to play.

Billy Davis caught one of Pete Gonzalez’s two touchdown passes yesterday. Davis’ touch-
down came on a tipped ball, which he caught and ran, unmolested, into the end zone.

Karcher said. “I’m very pleased
with the progress of the team
up to this point and the
progress that our three battling
quarterbacks have made.”

Several projected starters on
next year’s team did not play in
the game due to injuries or
recovery from injuries.
Offensive linemen Matt Bloom
and Lawson Mollica, defensive
lineman Matt Hosilyk, line-
backer Tom T urnulty, and run-
ning back Curtis Martin were
among those who did not see
action.

increase as the new
recruits and transfers,
numbering over 30, come
on board. Majors feels the
new class will provide
some help, considering
last year’s team had a
problem with lack of per-
sonnel.

“I feel we had a decent
recruiting class” Majors
said.

Did the spring drills cat-
apult the Panthers in their
effort to improve and
become better next year?

That is a 50-50 question
which was addressed by
Coach Majors following
Saturday’s Blue-Gold
intra-squad scrimmage.

“The good news is we
have almost everyone
back from last year’s
team," Majors said. "The I
bad news is last year’s
team went 3-8.”

 

Continued from page 8

beat us, and today we kind of
beat ourselves.”

In the third game, errors, not
walks, almost led to the
Panthers’ demise.

Pitt starter Brian Shaffer was
rolling into the sixth inning with
a four-run lead when Pitt’s
defense started to collapse. The
usually sure-handed shortstop
Gonzalez committed two errors.
Shaffer managed to pitch out of
the jam, only letting up one run.

Then in the seventh inning
things got a lot messier.

With two outs and no runners
on, Georgetown scraped up
three runs with help from the
Pitt fielders. DeCaro’s single
was bookended by two Tyler
errors and then another single.
The inning was capped off with
an error by first baseman
Crawley.

“The first one just took off
from me,” Tyler said. “But the
second one I started jawing
with their bench and thinking
about it. I came up with the ball
and thought about it and
thought about it and finally
threw it and I muffed the play.”

To make amends, Tyler hit a
two-run bomb over the left field
fence in the first inning and sin-
gled in the fifth.

After Shaffer let up a two-min
homer to Halladay he was
pulled for Jamie Goettler who
got the win in 1 2/3 innings
pitched with three strikeouts.

Shaffer let up only five hits,

five walks and four earned runs
in 7 1/3 innings for the no—deci—
sion. . ‘
“He pitched a great game,”
Jackson said. “We didn’t play
well behind him and he hung in
there and that shows a lot for
Brian. He handled that whole
situation really well. That’s even
hard for guys in the Majors to
maintain there composure
when things go wrong like
that.”

Down by two runs in the bot-
tom of the eighth inning, Pitt
decided to have its usual big
inning. '

Just as the Panthers lost on
walks in the second game, there
was a reversal of fortune in the
third game.

With one out, Hoya pitcher
Brian O’Hare lost control, walk-

Then there were those who
would honk and give the
thumbs-up sign, like the woman
driving the PAT bus in front of
Kaufmann’s department store.
Or the woman wanting to give a
donation to SET A after reading a
few of the signs.

“I agree with that one, that’s

the protestors, pointing to a sign
stating “Store your furs forever.”

ing in three runs. After consecu-
tive walks to Jason Conti and
Gonzalez, Bob Miller singled,
loading up the bases.

O’Hare proceeded to walk
Crawley and pinch hitter Jeff
Montgomery. Scott Etsell struck
out and then Tyler Shantz
walked. Jon DeBernardis col-
lected the only hit of the four-
run inning with a squibber
between the pitcher and the
second baseman.

“After we got the lead again -

we were like ‘Enough, this is
Georgetown,”’ iron man
DeBernardis, who caught all
three games, said. “We just
pulled off that big inning, but
we can’t do that against St.
John’s or Seton Hall because
they’re a whole lot better than
these guys.”

The first game of the series
was more like Panther baseball:
a whole lot of hitting and good,
solid pitching.

Old reliable Mrochko was on
the mound. And when he’s
pitching, he’s perfect so far.

Mrochko pitched a complete
game, upping his record to 7-0
overall and 4-0 in the Big East.
He let up five runs on 13 hits,
four walks and three strikeouts.

“I’m on a roll, I guess,”
Mrochko said. “This past week-
end I didn’t have my slider and
all I had was my fastball. It
made me a little nervous, but I
knew the conditions weren’t
that great.”

Pitt was also smoking with
the bat.

Etsell went two-for-four with
a "two-rim homer and four RBI.
Tyler Shantz added three more
RBI to his team leading total on
two hits.

DeBernardis also went two-
for—two with four RBI.

  

   

 
 

Walks

and giving the Panthers a
10-8 lead. But the
Panthers were not done
yet.

DeBernardis then sin-
gled to second base, scor-
ing another Panther run
and getting an. 11-8 lead.
Womelsdorf struck out to
end the inning but the
damage was done, and
thanks to five free passes
in the eighth inning
alone, the “walk club”
gave the Panthers five
unanswered runs to take
the lead.

Goettler retired the
Hoya side and earned the
victory as he pitched 1
2/3 innings of no-hit
baseball, striking out
three.

“The first game we
were unable to throw the
ball to spots and basically
couldn’t throw strikes,
and [with 13 walks] you
can’t win when you walk
that many guys  We
didn’t really play good
baseball but were fortu-
nate to win two out of
three” Jackson said.

The final scorecard for
the weekend read like
this: G-Town gave up a
total of 25 walks and
committed seven errors
while the Panthers didn’t
play much better, totaling
for 23 walks and seven
errors.

The victory gave the
Panthers a 21-9-1‘ overall
record, 11-1 in Big East
play, while the Hoyas
dropped to 4-7 in Big East
action.

Merletti began with a quote
from Ingrid Newkirk, an animal
rights activist, “For anyone
wearing fur this year, the only
appropriate accessory will be
ear plugs. Even if they’re com-
pletely insensitive to animal suf-
fering, we will show them that
fur is a social liability.”

Answering the question of
how she got into animal rights,
Merletti told about a woman in
her neighborhood who was
cruel to both children and ani-
mals.

“There were a lot of animals
that disappeared in our neigh-
borhood,” Merletti said. “and
one morning, I was about six or
seven at the time, my mom

opened up the door and found
our dog laying on the porch
motionless, [and] bloody. He
had been caught in a trap.” »

Merletti said her dog was
more fortunate than other
animals that get caught in
traps, because he had been
loved and cared.for and was
able to get around several
months later.

She then described how ani-
mals caught in traps left by fur
trappers are killed by having
their necks broken or through
electrocution. ’

“I started learning more about
how innocent creatures are
turned into a luxury product,”
said Merletti. “The more I found

LAX

Continued from page 8

The turning point of the game
came in the fourth quarter,
when defenseman Darrell
Schmitt was ejected and given a
three—minute unreleasable
penalty.

It was at this point that WVU

got hot, overtook Pitt and even-
tually held on to win the
game.
I “We couldn’t put it together.
we came in lackluster, and we
played the game lackluster,”
said defenseman John Foris.
“There were times this season
when we looked like world-
beaters; I can truly say that this
is the best team that Pitt has
ever had.”

With this loss, Pitt now has
two division losses" to its name,
and that is the biggest reason
why they will most likely

be left out of this year’s play-
offs.

Plus, WVU was the team the
Panthers were competing
against for the wild card
spot.

This year’s team is made up of
a lot of players from last sea-
son’s National Collegiate
Lacrosse League championship
team, and to have this type of
ending to their season this time
around is very
disappointing.

“It would have been nice to
return to the playoffs this year

and to prove that last year was
not a fluke, because that’s what
a lot of people believe it was,
even though we beat all of
those teams again this year in
our tournament,” Foris
added.

The teams are selected to the
playoffs based primarily on
their overall record and how
well they performed within
their own lacrosse
divisions.

The situation is reminiscent of
last year’s situation in baseball
when the San Francisco Giants
won over 100 games yet did not
advance to the playoffs.

“The NCAA tournament is
selected by invitation, and
going by that way we would
have definitely been in. But in
this case, we are being left out
of the picture,” Foris
said.

“There are good and bad
sides to doing it this way. The
good side eliminates the politics
that are sometimes involved,
like last year when Notre Dame
was selected over Rutgers sim-
ply because they were Notre
Dame." '

"The bad side is in cases like
this one. Teams cannot always
play up—to-par every game,"
Foris said.

"I know for a fact that we
would have won the champi-
onship."

out about trapping, the more I
couldn’t divorce that suffering.
When I see a fur, I don’t see
glamor. I see suffering.”

Merletti said she went through
an angry phase when she
would just glare at anyone
wearing a fur, but then realized
she wasn’t changing anything
by just glaring at people.

“[Now] when I see a woman
in fur, I’Il politely offer here
some information.” She then
hands out a card, put out by
People for the Ethical Treatment
of Animals, detailing the meth-
ods used when trapping an ani-
mal.

“I feel like there’s ignorance
and there’s arrogance, and if

someone’s ignorant about the
facts on fur, they get [the cards]
and you can change them,” said
Merletti.

Nicola Hill, vice-president
of SETA, said the threat of rain
and upcoming exams may have
kept some at home, but she
was still pleased with those
who came out in support of the
rally.

“Every little thing that you
do helps. We gave out some lit-
erature, and some people saw
us.”

Hill said the signs and coffins
put an image in the minds of
those who saw them, and the
image will hopefully stay and
change their views on fur.
