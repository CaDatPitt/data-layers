‘With the-forming‘-of parties and
platforms andithe circulating of
petitions, the 1969 Student Gov-
ernment election campaign offi-
cially began -at noon yesterday.
.All petitions are due at the SU
desk before 6 ,p._m. Wednesday.
A mandatory meeting for all can-
didates is scheduled for Friday at

\ noon and 5 p.m. in 305 SU. Vot-
ing will take place Jan. 22 in the
SU ballroom between 9:30 a.m.
and6p.m.

During the tenure of out-going,

SG President Ken Schueler a po-
larization of political thought de-
veloped. The upcoming election,
it seems, will include parties from
the right and left of the political
spectrum.

Last year’s campaign began as

candidates. Then Armand Belly,

politics by his intention to abol-

and running mate Joe*Kociubes.
The final tally registered 1,049
votes for Schueler,i_1,003 for Bel-
ly, and 432 for DOPERAK.

The PAT" party won the over-
whelming majority of Senate
seats, electing 17 to USA’s five.
Three independent senators wer
also elected. -'

The fact that only 2,500 stu-
dents voted in the election indi-
cated student disinterest in the
entire campaign. Because’ over
1,000 students voted to abolish
S t u d e n t Government, Schueler
realized that he had a great task
before him. The new SG presi-
dent had to prove that Student
Government was a viable force
for affecting change on campus.

The 1968 Student Government
proved ‘to be more liberal than
expected. Primary achievements
were in thearea of student rights.
A Legal Awareness Committee
was established to inform stu-
dents of their legal rights and to
Ainsure protection against infringe-
ment of these rights-. A pamphlet

throughout the campus.

For the first time in the history
of SG, students are totally re-
sponsible for recognition of stu-
A dent organizations. The,_Commit-
tee on Student Organizations was
established for this purpose.

Another first was the initiation
of two student voting seats on the

V Undergraduate Council.

The president of SG is now per-
mitted to attend Faculty Senate
meetings, but does not_have vot-
ing privileges. ‘

The "Student «Government Sen-

W as "published a nd' circulated M

ate voted to abolish credit for
ROTC. This was later ratified by
the faculty of the College of Arts
and Sciences.

Revamped registration policy
was instituted on a ‘trial basis to
try to facilitate more expedient
course registration. V

Student Government joined the
National S t u d e n t Association
(NSA), an nationwide organiza-
tion of student political bodies.

Much criticism from within and .

without SG was directed at the
Senate. Many students feel that
the Senate is a useless structure.
Others directed their dissatisfac-
tion against a number of senators
believed to be apathetic. It is sig-
nificant that four senators resign-
ed during the year because they
‘felt that the senate could not ac-
complish anything worthwhile.

A committee to restructure SG
was established but never got off
the ground.

Last September the student
body began to split into liberal
and conservative- factions. The

’ _liberal body of thought first ap- -

peared in strength as a gr 0 u p
k n o w n as. ‘Concerned Students.
Several meetings were held on
the Cathedral lawn in which they
demanded reforms from the ad-
ministration. '

As Concerned Students as a

_ group quickly faded out, opposi-

tion to ROTC gained momentum.
This movement resulted in the
discreditation of ROTC.

A left-wing newspaper, Alter-
natives, appeared on campus for
first time in October‘.

upcoming election. The platform

Coed Co-op Housing
Planned for Future

“Students owned and operated housing not only takes the Univer-
sity out of the landlord system and puts it back into the education sys-
tem, it also prepares the student for society and gives him a ‘home’
where there is privacy, comfort, and territoriality,” stated Suzann Sly-
man,-chairman of the Student Government <SGl Committee on Co-

operative Housing.

Campus co—ops are run by students for students’ benefit. They are

owned and operated by the Uni-
versity students who live in them.
They free students to live crea-
tively in an environment they
help design.

The housing is set up in “re-
sponsibility units.” They are fam-
ily sized houses, apartments, or
suites in which eight or nine peo-
ple live as a community. The unit
consists of: a living room, bed-
study rooms which do not open
into the living room, a common
bathroom, a large kitchen, and
other common rooms built for
daily life.

There is no central control. As
in a home environment, students
within each responsibility unit ro-
tate or divide the work to ‘main-

pared by the students and food
costs are shared. Anything need-
ing repair is the group’s respon-
sibility to repair it.

Ahousing co-op is inclusive and
consists of one or more groups of
eight or nine people who under-
stand the concept of community.
The co-op is a community in the
sense that it is a democratic en-
vironment based on a sense of re-
sponsibility and cooperation.
Ideally, such an environment will
develop self-awareness and great-
er communication between indi-
viduals.

Three elements are needed to
organize a housing co-op: ‘people
to own and run the co-op, experi-
enced and responsible organizers

The University Committee on

Dec. 9 and acquainted its grow-

of the general committee’s work.

Already well established is a
Talent Bank containing the names
of faculty members who have vol-
unteered their services as tutors
for the members of the black
community that request it. Thus
far, 50 names have been gathered.

The committee members also
tossed around ‘a suggestion to set
up a committee under official
University aegis to research and
attack the problems on campus.
But this suggestion was counter-
ed by the possible consequences
which could limit its effective-
ness. For one thing, it was brought
up that if the committee were un-
der complete University control,
the involvement and participation
of the black community may be
discouraged.

As well, a questions was raised
on the desirability of the Chan-
cellor’s proposals. Plans were
made to meet shortly with Dr.

Another program presently in
operation is a series of sensitivity
training group sessions. The
groups are composed of the Chan-
cellor, the deans of the respective
departments and the members of
the Hill Team from the Western
Psychiatric Clinic. Six to eight
persons participate in each sub-
group.

Joseph Colangelo, chairman of
the task force on Racism at the
University,'described the purpose
of the weekly meetings. Design-
ed to unearth the hidden preju-
dices and malignant attitudes of
m e m b e r s of both races, the
groups “have been making slow,
but steady progress,” mused Col;
angelo. "We hope to generate fur-
ther sensitivity groups in other
areas. We are. proud because this
is the first instance of a cross sec-
tion of the senior staff of a uni-
versity to attack a common prob-
lem,” he continued.

Some of the members turned
their minds to preventive cures
for future problems. James Hol-
land of the LRDC looked forward
to the construction of new build-
ings on the campus and the result-
ing level of black employment
among the work crews.

“In a community with such a
large,base, we should be assured
of black employees at all levels
of the construction work,” stated
Holland. He cited possible prob-
lems of a contractual, union and

At this time of nitty-gritty student
‘politicking, The Pitt News believes
it is necessary to explain to the stu-
dents the manner in which the forth-
coming Student Government elections
will be covered. ‘

In-the past, coverage of the cam-
, paign was handled by one staff writer.
",-This year, however, the Student Gov-
ernment political campaign will be
:handled by a team of writers, due to
1the complexity of the political climate
*-on campus. The team method will en-
. able us to provide detailed coverage
:7 of all campaign speeches and debates.
 Heading up the team of the four
campaign writers will be Staff Co-
ordinating Editor Sheryll Zippay.
‘Working with Miss Zippay will be
'-Staff’ Feature Editor Don Marbury,
and Staff News Writers Peggy Allen
and Pat Borkowski. These staff writ-
J ers have divorced'th‘emselves from any
-_ sort of political activity to insure ba_l-
’-anced campaign coverage, free from

/any conflict ofinterest.

Election coverage, this year-, will
._a_,ls'o.feature a special analysis of all
the party platforms. The analysis will
will draw into account the relation-
-ships between the ‘forthcoming plat-
"forms and the “edicts” of the past.
},Beyond this, the analysis will discuss
.-the feasibility of eact party’s state-
jments. And all party platforms will
 be published in their entirety.

cerning The Pitt News endorsement.
Many students thinkthat the decision-
making power concerning an endorse-
ment rests with the editor. This is hog-
wash. The endorsement of any politi-
cal candidate is decided by a majority
vote of The Pitt News Editorial Board.
Those Board members who dissent
from the majority decision have the
opportunity to write a signed column
stating their preferences. All of this,
we hope, will provide the students.
with balanced campaign coverage.

We would like to insure all can-
didates that The Pitt News will not
play favorites in its campaign cover-
age, nor will we be the “behind the
scenes” sponsors of a certain party or

candidate. To guard against “rooting
for the favorites,

,7

we will have one
campaign reporter responsible for the
coverage of one particular political
party. I

Our goal in this campaign is to
provide the students with balanced re-
porting that will allow for rational

comparison of the candidates and

their views.

And it is our hope that this cam-
paign will be issue oriented rather
than being concerned with personal-
ity attacks.

Associate Editor

Sometimes, it pays to get up in the
morning. -

Take Saturday for example. The wrest-
ling team was going to lose, but it didn’t
matter. Not after what Larry Cuba did.

Larry is a wrestler who really hasn’t
wrestled since he came to school here. He
had a problem; you might call it a lack of

    
   

confidence. T h e o n 1 y ..
impression he ever?
made on the mat was
getting his nose rubbed

But on this day, Lar- '
ry did what each and
everyone of uswants to '
He t u r n e d t h e
tables; he sp‘at'e at late.
He beat the system, the . .  
odds. He overcame the GE0 GE LIES
Green Dragon, the first in a long line of
Green Dragons for a young man.

AS THE CLICHE goes, you had to be
there to see it. Larry, the St. George of
Pitt, jumped from the mat a victor. He ran
and did a Yogi Berra into coach Dave
Adams arms.

This wasn’t just a single win; it was
more like that wonderful daydream which
came true, or like that first time when
someone - who - means - something says,
“You’re wonderful.” -

Then look at Sunday. Joe Namath and
the New York Jets. Unbelievable.

This was the American dream come
true, where the poor commoner ends up
with the beautifulprincess; the perfect ex-

 

Dr. Posvar’s-

by DAVID ROSENBLUM
Staff Columnist

King Wesley the Worst is at it again.
With that peculiar lack of gumption that
is only his,’ he has refused to uphold the
principle of a free university press that he
had guaranteed. The current “Posvar Fol-
ly". involves the much-maligned news
sheet, Alternatives. .

/ As everyone‘ knows, the third issue of
that paper contained certain four letter
suggestions on how the ‘ ‘ ‘ '
general populus should
view our president-
elect. Naturally, this
enraged some of our stu-
dent censors who
promptly confiscated 2,
000 copies. Did this
bother our king! No! .
He was more concern- I 
ed with the microscop- ROSENBLUM
ic words that appeared in the filigree.

AFTER A MEETING of the Univer-
sity’s Publication Board, it was decided
that since Alternatives was not violating
any law by printing the words, there was
no reason to take any action against it.
The king didn’t exactly execute hand-
springs over this decision and he compos-
ed a polite letter announcing his dismay

‘ at the board’s decision.

Lo and behold,‘ you’ll never guess what
happened. When the fourth issue of Alter-
natives was sent to the University’s Cen-

tral Printing, our self-appointed literary
critic, Clarence “Goodbody” Beers, de-
cided that some of the words in the edi-
torial did not meet his righteous standards
of good tase; accordingly he refused to
print the issue because of the offending
words. This is in complete opposition to
the king’s statement on freedom of the
press, as well as the decision of the Pub-
lications Board.

How did Sir Wes react? To everyone‘s

complete surprise (and I trust you" denote‘
. the sarcasm) he said that he c_ould_not_

 

 

ample of how Americans always pull for
the underdog. The inevitable never came.
And it didn’t matter who you bet on, down
deep inside you wished it would happen.

AH, IT’S MISERABLE to be rich like
that team from Baltimore. How could they
enjoy to win, anyway? Why would anyone
want to be a Mellon, when he could be an
Andy Capp, a W. C. Fields, or a Groucho
Marx. I

How can money compare to this joy,
this one satisfying moment of excitement
that will last in the mind forever. This
happiness doesn’t pay the rent, the food
bill, or the electric bill. It can’t make the
car run, the stocks rise and fall, or pay for
your funeral. And ‘it doesn’t build sky-
scrapers, industries, or bridges. But who
cares! '

Joe certainly did not walk away with
empty pockets. But he gave more than he
received. And this is what makes a man.
Giving and sharing. This is what is consi-
dered when a man is judged.

Now‘Larry and Joe aren’t familar with
each other, but right ‘now these two indi-
viduals have more in common than Bor-
man, Lovell, and Anders. They’ll never
have to brag or boast about it, because it's
there in black and white excitement.

WHAT THESE TWO gentlema n
achieved was a tribute to days of sweating,
frustration, hurts and wounds, and a proud
spirit. Their qualities surpassed hovering
in a cold corner, and crying alone at night.
Their qualities are the ones that keep each
of us plugging away, waiting for the day
when everything clicks, everything falls
into place. And taking everything into ac-
count, that day is worth it all.

toice Beers to print simethmg that he
conscientiously objected to. Our Lord
High Tax Collector and Book Store Sher-
iff, Edison Montgomery also upheld Beers’
right to censor whatever he deemed ob-
jectionable.

I KNOW THE REASON; for the king’s
hypocritical position couldn’t have been
influenced by his own personal anger at

. Alternative’s anti-ROTC position, or a sour

grapes attitude over the decision of the
Publication’s "Board, so what could possi-
bly be behind his reluctance to take the
appropriate action against Beers? .

Student Government has passed a res-
olution stating that “the Chancellor should

A direct Central Printing toyprint the fourth

issue of Alternatives, andlshould Central
Printing refuse, those responsible should
be dismissed without delay.” It is obvious
to the members of the student senate that
Central Printing, which is part of the Uni-
versity, has been derelect in carrying out
its operations.

BEERS CANNOT BE allowed to ar-
bitrarily refuse to print something that he
finds objectionable. If he’d rather quit
his job than print the words in the Alter-
natives editorial, he "should quit. If he
doesn't quit, he should be fired.

If the king does not want a free press

_at this University, he should come right

out and say so. There is no reason for him
to expound one principle and then follow
another. There is no reason for him to play

. coy games with the editors of Alternatives

by telling them there is nothing he can do.

Whether he realizes it or not, he is the
Chancellor. He is the man who declared
there will be no University censorship. He
can no longer afford his two-faced tactics;
some people won't buy it. For once let him
take a firm stand: either there will be cen-
sorship, or there will not be censorship.
For once let him tell the public what his
position truly is. For once let him act with
the dignity of a kingfinstead of the fool-

ish demeanor of a court jester. , , '

Editor, The Pitt News:

I would like to express my grat-
itude to the Pitt News for pub-
lishing the rather interesting and
stimulating rep r i nt “Orgasm"
from the Bard College Observer.

I feel obligated, however, to
contest some of the fictious myths
attempting to be propagated in
it; it is unfortunately in lay edi-
torials as this that such ideas are
distributed as gospel to the gne—
eral public, leading to unfounded
and unnecessary fears, errors, and
complications in the future.

The author of this reprint ar-
ticle protests that her “own bio-
logy has not been properly ana-
lyzed” and that she and her sex-
ual colleagues have been discrim-
inated against by being “defined
sexually in terms of what pleases
men.” She bases there grievances
on the argument that “. . . since
the clitoris is usually not direct-
ly stimulated in the conventional,
sexual position, we are left ‘frig-
id.”’ ’

While I cannot speak with the
same subjective authority as the
author of these assertions for rath-
er obvious anatomical and_ phy-
siological considerations, I am

Senior Agrees On
‘Dictatorship’

Editor, The Pitt News:

The article “Dictatorship Plan-
ned” in the.December 6 edition
was the first on this problem I’ve
seen outside of certain conserva-
tive papers. My only quarrel is
with its placement. It should have
been on page one in bold face
type.

It nicely compliments the ear-
lier article on the National Rifle
Association concerning the NRA’s
fea r of dictatorship following
‘universal gun registration, for
what possible force besides ef-
fective weapons in the hands of
the mass of the population could
deter a would-be dictator from
acting? (Hitler and other fascists
were elected to office and work-
ed from there.)

The crime control argument
for repressive gun controls has
been blown up many times, but
one more won’t hurt. Despite cer-
tain lies issued by the government
lately, the crime rate in states
with ‘repressive policies on gun
ownership have an average crime
rate slightly higher than those
with enlightened policies. The
murder rate is virtually the same
(if certain southern states were
deleted, the gun repression states
would have a much higher crime
and murder rates’).

By picking high crime states
in the free states column and low
crime states in the repressive col-.
umn, certain liars in the govern-
ment have tried to strengthen the
anti-gun crowd’s flimsy argument.

A more relevant statistic is the
ratio of crime to the number of
guns per hundred thousand pop-
ulation.

When house wives in certain
areas armed themselves (with

much publicity to be sure), at-

' tacks on women decreased dra-

matically in the area and increas-
ed in surrounding areas. Obvious-
ly, the hoods took their trade to
less dangerous regions. Often this
was accomplished without a n y

' shooting. Nationally no one knows

how many crimes were prevent-
ed by the mere presence of civil-
ian guns_. Restricting gun owner-
ship to a very few is probably the
worst way to find out.

_l\TI_ed Student Sizes-Up ‘Orgasm’

a b l e to offer some rebuttal to
them on a more objective basis.

Although many responsible stu-
dies have been and are being
done in this area, I will limit my
cursory_ comments in this article
to a few of the facts objectively
studied and published by Masters
and Johnson in their Human Sex-
ual Response, the most recent and
widely accepted publication in
this field; all further quotes will
be from this text.

The author of “Orgasm” is cor-
rect in her assertion that it is the
clitoris which is the chief inte-
grator of both somatogenic and
psychogenic stimuli in the hu-
man female. In fact, the clitoris
“ . . is truly unique in the human
system in that its only function is
that of serving as an erotic focus
for both afferent a n d efferent
forms of sexual stimulation.”

However,  L . the fact that the
clitoral glans rarely is contacted
directly by the penis in intrava-
ginal thrusting does not preclude
the coital development of indi-
rect clitoral involvement.”

In fact, such indirect somatic
clitoral stimulation does occur
during coitus as a " . result of‘
penile traction on the minor la-
bial hood, and this traction oc-
curs regardless of female coital
positioning, anatomic variations

 

 

in clitoral size, or crural origin
on the public rami.”

3 79

As for “Orgasm s demand that
“new techniques” be d e v i s ed,
Masters and_ Johnson warns that
the “intensity of vaginal extero-
ceptive a nd proprioceptive re-
sponse can be dulled for the fe-
male partner by any awkward at-
tempt to provide direct clitoral
glans contact.” This is not, how-
ever, meant as a deterrent from
individual s e x u a 1 experimenta-

tion in efforts to achieve more‘

mutual sexual satisfaction.

I hope that the above brief and
admittedly in c o m pl e te para-
graphs will serve to correctqsome
of the fallacious concepts which
may have been assimilated by
your readers.

As for “Orgasm’s” author,

along with the above statements,-

I would like toremind her that
the clitoris responds with equal‘
facility to both somatogenic and
psychogenic forms of stimulation.
Thus, in her search for explana-
tions of any “frigidity” which she
might experience in herself, it
may well be necessary to look
elsewhere than her partner or

partners and, despite her liberal -

education-, to avoid assigning in-
tellectual conceptualizations to
emotional experiences.

Bethlehem Steel
Loop Course Interviews:

~ 31 4, 

What is the Bethlehem Loop Course? It is our management development program for graduates .

FEBRUAIRY   l

The course starts early in July with four weeks of orientation at our home offices in Bethlehem,_

Pa.‘ Loopers attend lectures on every phase of the corporation’s activities, and make almost daily
visits to a steel plant. »

Steel Plant Loopers, who comprise a majority of the average loop class of 150 to 200 graduates,
proceed to various plants where they go through a brief orientation program before beginning
their on-the-job training assignments. Within a short time after joining the course, most loopers
are ready for assignments aimed toward higher levels of management.

How about other loopers? Our Sales Department loopers (30 or so) remain at the home oﬁice for
about a year of training. Most are then assigned to district oﬂices where they take over established
accounts. ’ A‘
Fabricated Steel Construction loopers are trained in a drafting room, on a ﬁeld erectioneproject,
in a fabricating shop, and in an engineering oﬂice. A looper’s ﬁrst work assignment is based on
interests and aptitudes disclosed during this program.
Loopers in Accounting, Shipbuilding, Mining, Research, Traﬂic, Purchasing, Finance and Law,

General Services, and Industrialand Public Relations go‘ through training programs tailored to.’ '

Outsiders To Action

by Art Rosengarten

Staff Sports Writer

With the sudden change of heart of Frank Kush, one
begins to wonder what it is about the athletic program,
and football in general, that makes outsiders suspicious‘ and
uneasy about Pitt.

Three other outsiders before Kush have attempted to
findthe answer. Each has had varying degrees of suc-
cess in attempting to explain the problem, but none have
found any solutions. -- A

The first outsider to tackle the pro-
blem was formerfootball coach Dave
Hart. Hart came to the University .
with an unrestrained enthusiasm and,
a desire to bring about rapid changes.
But, he failed and failed badly.

He failed becaus_e he wasn’t a Pitt_;_
man and he tried to buck the well-
entrenched Pitt system. Promises that
were made to him when he was hired,-
were. never kept. His relationship ,
with Athletic Director Frank Carver was, cool, to say the
least. Money and aid from within the university commu-
nity was small, and often lacking. But, most of all, he
had to‘ operate under rules and ideals that were outdated,
but followed to a tee by Hart's superiors.

Hart becam_e the first outsider to fall to Pit‘t’s aca-
demic standards, limited scholarships, ban on red shirt-
ing, inferior physical facilities, and a lack of alumni and
faculty support. 

The next outsider to tackle Pitt’s- problems is Chan-
cellor Wesley Posvar. Even though he is -mainly involved
in activities within the academic sphere, as Chancellor he
has already demonstrated a keen awareness of the athletic
problems at Pitt. He has attended many of the athletic
events and has seen the embarrassment that Pitt has suf-
fered. '

The Chancellor holds the key to many of the solutions.
Now that he has finally become adjusted to his new pos-
ition, it is time for him to take charge. With his leader-
ship on the issues of languagerequirements, admission
standards for athletes, and finances, Posvar will be able
to take an active part in remolding the damaged and de-
moralized state of Pitt athletics.

Posvar has taken a step in the right direction by as-
serting some influence in the selection of a new athletic
director. The choice of Posvar’s close acquaintance Cas-
imir Myslinski seems to be a step in the right direction.

Out the onset. of his tenure as the new A.D., My-
slinski seems to be a dynamic and enthusiastic worker.
His choice of Frank Kush as the newhead football coach
appeared to be a wise one. What Pitt needed was a winner,
and Myslinski went out and attempted to get one.

Now that Kush has had a change of heart about the
Pitt job, it is up to Mysliaiski to find out just why a fine
coach like Kush was frightened away.

Immediately "Myslinski must re—evaluate in his own

 

‘Art
Ros engarten

mind just what he is trying to sell to these prospective"

coaches, and later to prospective athletes. There must be

some reason for a football team to deteriorate from a high

class caliber to a patsy, in a- short matter of two years.

Also, he must find out why the rest of Pitt Athletics has
declined too.

It is in his realm as athletic director that Myslinski
must find and supply the solutions. He is no longer an out-
sider to Pitt, but he must not begin to think like a Pitt
man. He must use his own judgement and make his own
degsions, not follow the established lines.

It is unfortunate that Pitt has lost such a good and suc-
cessful coach as Frank Kush, but Pitt has to find out just
why it lost him. Hopefully, with the new closeness be-
tween the athletic department and the academic commun-
ity, resented by the friendship of Chancellor Posvar and
Casimir Myslinski, someone will come up with some an-

I swers and solutions to this serious problem. _ ' - .

A multitude of turnovers

throughout. the game.

After the first two minutes of the second half$
nearly all of the Field House fans were rooting,
hoping, and believing that an upset victory in Point
Park’s favor would be forthcoming. Randy Brenner’

who led the Little Pioneers in

points’ sank a 20 foot jump-shot to narrow the Cub

lead to a mere two points’ 367034.

Despite the lack of- support-no _ Pitt fans were
admitted to the Field House to watch their team play
since Point Park had rented the floor for the night-

Kent Scott’s shooting and 6’7”

rebounding pulled the Cubs out of the tight squeeze.

After Scott, who finished as high scorer with
26 points, whipped in two‘ baskets’ and Bob Ciz-
marik hit on a free throw, the Cubs slightly in-

creased their lead, 41-37.

All of a sudden, the frosh displayed a polished
passing game and consistently broke into the open

The matmen dropped their
second dual meet of the young
season Saturday at the Field
House, falling to Navy 27-8.
Navy has been billed as the “best
in the East” in pre—season an-
alyses, and according to coach
Dave Adams, his boys were just
outwrestled by the Middies.

“Our boys wrestled real well Sa-
turday,” he explained. “The whole
team went out their aggressively.
We took the fight to them. We were
just outwrestled, that’s all.”

Three of Adams" boys were not
outwrestled, however, as Larry
Cuba,-‘Mark Payne and Ralph Cin-
drich picked up eight points for
the grapplers. The eight points re-
gistered against Navy are the most
any opponent has managed so far
this season and Navy’s total of
27 is also their lowest in four
matches this year.

Cuba, senior captain, and Payne,
a sophomore, defeated their op-
ponents decisively, while Cin-
drich, in his varsity debut,,fought
Eastern heavyweight champion
Mark Kane to a draw.

Cuba, at 130, faced a rematch
with Navy captain Steve Com.-
iskey. In last year’s match, the
twohad fought to. a draw as Cuba
registered the only points for the
varsity. Saturday, it was a differ-
ent story as Cuba handl Comis-
key his first defeat of the season,

 

first half didn’t stop the Panther basketball _
Cubs from notching their second consecutive
victory of the basketball season.

The Cubs nearly duplicated their earlierigame
' against Point Park, an 85-63_ victory; In fact, in the
previous win and in Saturday’s 81-66 contest over
Point Park, the Cubs held only a six point half time
lead and experienced several hot and cold spells

 Bucknell Whips Mermen, But
Wessel Breaks Two Records    

by MARTIN HELLMAN

An outstanding performance by sophomore diver David Wes-
sel was one of the few bright spots for the Pitt swimming
 team in Saturday’s meet against the Bucknell Bisons. The
powerful Bucknell squad had little trouble in crushing the

Wessel broke both school records in the one and three meter diving
events, and set a new Trees Pool record in the three meter competi-
tion with a total of 220.80 points, eclipsing the old record of 214.10.

The freestyle relay team of
both Norris’, Dave Smith, and
Joe Hayes won the event when
the Bucknell coach decided to
swin an exhibition quartet instead
of his regular lineup.

The varsity’s lack of depth was
evident in most of the events.
Coach Bill Grant summed up the
situation by saying, “They were
putting two good men against our
one good man in each event.”
The second varsity mermen usual-
ly finished far behind the others
in fourth place.

Assistant Coach Jerry Snyder
was pleased with several of the
swimmers times. “Norris’ time in
the butterfly is his best in two_
years,” he commented. “Also,
Dennis Spear knocked six sec-
onds off his best time in the
breastroke.”

Grant also found -two good
things amidst the loss. “The ad-
dition of Bill Tome this term will
be a big asset to us,” he said.
“Although Chuck Zientak finish-

ed last in both diving events, he
has improved greatly in the past
few weeks. Right now, he is bet-
ter than our best diver was on last
year’s squad.”

Although the swim team does
not possess the needed depth at
the present, this year’s fresh-
man squad should be able to help
greatly. Members of the frosh
swam in the Bucknell meet for ex-
hibition purposes. Not only did
they consistently beat the Pitt
varsity, but in several instances
also whipped the Bucknell tank-
men.

Fred Lewis managed second
place in the 500-yard freestyle
behind the ‘Bison winner, and
Al Morris beat everyone in the
breastroke.

   

Hoopsters .Miss Mark

Poor Shooting Causes
Seventh Straight Loss

by JERRY L. GRUEBEL
Substract the first twelve

minutes of Saturday night’s loss

to George Washington and the
cagers may well have chalked
up their -long-time—in-coming
third victory. But the hoopsters
once again learned that all forty
minutes count, as they were up-
ended for the seventh consecu-
tive game, 92-68.

The game started out as a com-
plete disaster for the cagers.
With a little more than eight min-
utes remaining in‘ the first half,
they were down, 46-15.

The hoopsters were completely,

outclassed. The offense was
stunned by George Washington’s
aggressive 1-3-1 defense, and it
seemed that each turn—over was

_ converted into two points by shoot-

ing phenom Bob Tallent.

“They (George Washington)
caused a lot of turn-overs,” moan-
ed Ridl, “about twenty - five.
That’svery bad.” '

While the cagers were throw-
ing the ball everywhere but in the
basket, George Washington was
getting off to a fast start.

-“They hit everything," said
Ridl. “And Bob Tallent hit ten of
his first fifteen shots.”

ROB McFARl.AND
Season High

Tallent finished the night with
17 out of 35 shots from the floor
and twelve free throws for a 46-
point production. The senior
guard hit most of his shots from
the outside.

But ball-handling was only half
of the cagers problem through
the first twelve‘ minutes. The hoop-
sters couldn‘t put the ball in the
hoop.

“We shot very poorly in the
first half,” explained Ridl. “We
shot only 30 per cent. But during
the first twelve minutes we shot
only 10 per cent.

“After the first twelve minutes
we played quite well,” said Ridl,
“but we fell too far behind. In
the second half we shot 49 per-
cent.” 4

Junior forward Bob McFarland
led the losers with 25 points, the
highest single‘-game output among
the cagers this season. Last year,
McFarland’s 26 points against

,Miami (Fla.) was tops.

Bob Petrini was the only other
bright spot for Ridl. The junior
guard had missed all but the last
two games of the season with in-
juries.

“He looked a lot better than
in his first game against Lafay-
ette,” said Ridl. “He’s going to
help us. He’s getting back in
shape, and he’s moving_a lot bet-
ter.”

Petrini, hailed as a freshman for
his ability to shoot from the out-
side, could be the answer to cager
dry spells. Ridl knows the im-
portance of field goal accuracy.
Thus far this season the cagers
have shot well under the 42 per
cent that the new head coach fig-
ured would be needed for a win-
ning season. The 10 per cent mark
in the first twelve minutes of Sa-
turday night’s was their low.

T‘ Despite Score

Gym Squad Improve

by MIKE WALDHOLZ

“Temple really had no trouble with us,” was coach Warren
Neiger’s first reaction to Pitt’s 148.18 to 88.45 loss to Temple
Saturday. Then reviewing the match coach Neiger added that
Pitt didn’t get above 100 points because, “we were forced into only
having two scores instead of three in two of the events due to illnesses.”

“The team, though, did show great improvement over it’s match
with Army a couple of weeks ago,” he said. Competing with only six
gymnasts, as Mike Beatty was recovering from the flu, and with Phil‘

Lilly entering four events with a
bad ankle, the team showed an
overall ability that Neiger hopes
gets better as the season progress-
es.

On the floor exercise event
Lowell Meek came up with the
team’s only first place as he post-
ed an 8.85. Neiger had onlyhigh
praise for Meek but felt a little
smoother performance can be ex-
pected from him.

Bernie Jesiolowski had fourth
place in this event with an 8.2,
an improved effort over his Army
performance.

Phil Lilly, with 6.85, Jim Bilec
with a 5.4, and Dave Andrew with
a 325 posted a low total in the
side horse event. This was An-
drews first competition while Bi-
lec’s score was a vast improve-
ment over his 3.25 against Army.

Bilec, though, was high man
in the still rings with a 7.45, still
too low to beat Temple’s high
score of 9.15. Meek and junior
Hoy Wong were Pittfs next high-
est scorers. On the long horse the
gymnasts were able to get a 7.975
from Andrew and a 7.325 from

Jesiolowski. Neiger "expected a .
little better " "

((.'m1fi/11/W1from I’u_r/r 9)

But other than the scoring per-
formances of Cuba, Payne and
Cindrich, the matmen were shut-
out. “We figured we had to win
with Pat Lavery, Buddy Morris
and Bobby Kuhn to take the
match,” indicated Adams. But all
three of these boys dropped their
matches. ‘

Lavery, at 137, lost a close 5-3 ~

decision to Dale Stahl. With the
score knotted 2-2 going into the
final period, Stahl scored a 2 points
on a reversal with 1:15 left in the
match. Lavery picked up a point
for an escape to make it 4-3, but
Stahl gained a point for riding
time to win the match.

Morris held a 3-2 lead on Hub
Carmichael going into the final
period, but the Navy grappler
scored a reversal early in the
Stanza to take the lead. Morris

picked up an escape, but Car-
michael countered with a takedown

and picked up riding time to win
the decision 7-4.

Kuhn dropped an 8-2 decision to
Bob Christianson at 160, while

_Paul Allen lost a close 5-3 match

to Greg Koons at 191. Tom Grant
was decisioned by Phil Conti 10-1
at 123, while both Jack Kuhn and
Ron Levandowski were pinned by
their opponents.

“the scores were not indicative of
their efforts.”

The squad’s two weakest events
are the parallel bars and the hori-
zontal bar. “In these two events
all our boys seemed a bit shook.
Lilly did badly and Jesiolowski

In retrospect Neiger feels his
gymnasts put on a decent perfor-
mance against a “truly g ood
team.” The fact‘ that Pitt has all

peting and that most gymnast
squads have atleast 15 to-20 men,
while the varsity has only seven

mains, nevertheless, as an un-
spoken testimonial to the uphill
battle the gymnasts face in every
meet this year.

Jim Banner took six athletes
to Washington to compete in
the CYO National ‘Invitational
Meet, Friday night. One of them
couldn’t finish his race, but the
thinclad coach came home satis-
fied with the entire group.

The runner who didn’t finish
was Jerry Richey. An ankle sprain
proved too much for the sopho-
more ace.

"I-‘started him,” said Banner.
“It was just one of those things.
He gave it a try, but when he
started limping I decided to take
him out.”

The mentor isn’t too unhappy,
though. He expects Richey to be
ready for Saturday’s'meet with
Kent State, and the entrants that
did compete Friday looked better
than Banner had expected.

“I thought we got off to a pret- i

ty good start,” the coach -decided.
“The relay team (one-miler) did
a real good job.» Rudy Hufnagle
had the best time, but they all
looked good.”

This group came in second in
their section to Morgan State.
Smitty -Brown, John Aiken, ‘Wal-
ly Swiger, and Hufnagle were one
second away from top honors.

  ~ Marketing at IBM

“Working with

companypresidents

is part of the jobi’

‘‘I’m pretty much the IBM Corporation in

the eyes of my customers,” says Andy Moran.
“That kind of responsibility’s not bad for an
engineer just two years out of school.”

Andy earned his B.S.E.E. in 1966. Today,
he's a Marketing Representative with IBM,
involved in the planning, selling and installa-
tion of data processing systems.

Plenty of business experience
“Engineering was my first love,” Andy says,

. “but I still wanted good business experience.”

So far, he's worked with customers involved
in many different computer applications,

from engineering to business. His contacts
go from data processing managers all the
way up to the presidentof his largestaccount.

“At first i was a little nervous about working
atthat leve|,” says Andy. “But then you realize

you're trained to know what he's trying to

. learn. That gives you confidence. You’re

helping him solve his problem.”

With his working partner, the data proc-
essing Systems Engineer, Andy has helped
many customers solve their information
handling problems. ‘‘I geta broad overview
of business because I run into every kind of
problem going. Sometimes I know the solu-
tions from experience. Other times I need
help from my manager.

“That’s one of the best things. My-manager
is more of a backup than a boss. He’s there
when I need him. Usually, I pretty much call
my own shots.”

Andy’s experience isn’t unusual at IBM.
There are many Marketing and Sales Repre-
sentatives who could tell you of similar
experiences. And they have many kinds of
academic backgrounds: business, engineer-
ing, liberal arts, science. A

They not only sell data processing equipment
as Andy does, but also IBM office products
and information records systems. Many of
the more technically inclined are data
processing Systems Engineers.
