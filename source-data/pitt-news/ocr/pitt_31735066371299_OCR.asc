Pitt’s Student Government Board
recently formed its sixth standing
committee -— the Affirmative
Action Committee ~ in response to
Pitt’s low minority enrollment and
retention rate.

According to board member
Pamela Hart, the committee will
work independently of the existing
‘Office of Affirmative Action and the
Chancellor’s Committee on Affir-
mative Action, but they will work
together on some issues.

_“The more organizations that you
have working toward the same goal
of affirmative action, the more that
will be accomplished,” Hart said. “I
think it’s an obligation of Student
Government because we are sup-
posed to serve all 5 our con-
stituencies."

“I think there’s going to be a lot of
cooperation among the groups,”
said Michael Bruner, assistant to the
director of the Office of Affirmative
Action.

GSPlAprofs: friction behind Funari’s exit

44¥444444444¥4444¥44444444

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

According to a professor in the
Graduate School of Public and
International Affairs (GSPIA), the
resignation last week of Dean John
Funari stemmed directly from ongo-
ing “friction” during the last 10
years. ' . ~

Another said Funari‘s resignation

. last Tuesday may be linked to a

faculty petition challenging the gov-
ernance system within GSPIA.
When contacted by The Pitt News,
Funari refused to discuss his leaving.

Michael Gold, a GSPIA professor
for 15 years, said Funari, who was
appointed clean on June 25, 1974,
decided he no longer thought his
post was worth holding because of
some faculty members’ objections to

his handling of the school‘s affairs. .

Though Gold did not care to
name specific individuals, he did say
a sizable portion of faculty members
were constantly opposed to Funari
as dean.

The‘Pitt News, Monday, February 27, 1984

“A lot of times, I wish John would
have done things differently,” he
said. “And I‘d often tell him so. But
he could not do exactly as 40 differ-
ent faculty members [the total in
GSPIA] would have liked ~- which
is just what I’d expect.

“He didn’t listen to‘ particular sets
[of faculty] often enough when they
wanted him to. I'd say 20 to 30 per-
cent of the faculty. Some of them
were people of character who dis-
agreed with his approach.” ,

Paul Hammond, a GSPIA profes-
sor for over.a year and a half, said

Funari‘s resignation probably came]

in the wake ofa special meeting held
on Friday, Feb. 17. In the meeting,
27 faculty and staff members dis-
cussed the merits of a University
Senate study group to be commis-
sioned to analyze governing practi-
ces and faculty ‘participation’ in
GSPIA decision-making.

The senate first became aware of
alleged problems within the school
when a secret petition —— signed by
six to l0 faculty members, Gold esti-
mated. — asked for outside

intervention.

“Faculty complaints to the senate,

might seem to lead to his departure,”
Hammond said. “They are related
[to his resignation], but I’m not sure
how. I haven’t been able to figure
out who to blame [for the resigna-
tion]. I am unsure.”

Both (Gold and Hammond agree
that Funari had been considering
resignation for anywhere from the
last several months to over a year.
Gold said Funari discussed resign-
ing with former provost Rhoten

Smith over a year ago.

He said he believes Funari no
longer wished to “fight an uphill
battle."

Gold continued: “The faculty here
has more than enough time for deci-
sion making. The real problem is the
number of people who have a
number of views on the world.
Faculty members in the administra-
tiorrthink they know how to admin-
ister. As a result, there’s been a lot of
second-guessing in our school.”

Dr. Leon Haley, formerly an asso-
ciate dean under Funari, is now the
acting dean of GSPIA and agreed
with Gold that faculty members are
included in school decision making.

“Maximal involvement is not
lacking in faculty participation,"
Haley said. “It is all a matter of to

what extent people want to get —

involved. It’s a question of percep-
tion. Participation has to be bal-
anced with accountability. _
“When someone is made dean,
authorization has to reside in his
final decisions," Haley said. “Other-

wise, you don’t need deans. You
might as well turn everything over to
the faculty, provosts, counselors.
The buck must stop with the dean.”

Haley has scheduled a meeting for
this week with faculty representa-
tives Larry Howard, Joe James and
Hammond. The four will set the
agenda for the first Faculty Advi-
sory Committee meeting since last
November. The committee usually
meets every month, but a new slate
of members has not been appointed
since the old group stepped down

four months ago.

Hammond said more faculty par-
ticipation is needed in the future,
adding that there wasn‘t enough in
the past.

“We‘re now trying to work with
the fact that Dean Funari has
resigned and GSPIA needs to main-
tain its momentum to strive toward
decisions affecting GSPIA’s future.

“It is not clear whether we have
unified goals. There is definite inter-
est to establish unified goals. I hope
we move in that direction.” I

Pitt gets $1 million grant

By Nancy Popkin
The Pitt News

A study of the risk factors for
heart disease in women is being con-
ducted at Pitt’s Graduate School of
Public Health over the next five
years.

Women run half the risk of heart
disease as men before menopause.
After menopause the risk of heart
disease becomes_ nearly the same for
women as men, said Dr. Jane Cos-
tello, a psychologist and researcher.
The National Heart, Lung and
Blood Institute has granted Pitt $1
million for the study.

“Because the average lifespan of
women in the U.S. is 77 years, one-
third of a woman’s lifetime is spent
after menopause when she runs the
greatest risk of heart disease — the
number one cause of death in post-
menopausal women," Costello said.

The purpose ofthe investigation is
to study the physical and behavioral
changes that women experience dur-
ing menopause and the link of both
factors to the risk of heart disease.

Researchers will randomly select
by zip code 500 women between the
ages of 45 and 50. Participants must
still have their menstrual period...agg
cannot be on the pill, pregnant,
hypertensive or diabetic. “At least

half ofthese women will probably go
through menopause during the
study,” Elaine Meilahn, project
director, said.

The project will be called the
“Healthy Women’s Study" because
it is more attractive to prospective
participants than the f‘.Menopause”
study, Meilahn said.

Over 100 of the women who have
been selected have already agreed to
participate. She hopes that studying
the women as they experience meno-
pause will provide information that
will help lessen fear and negative
connotations associated with that
part of a woman’s life clinically
defined by the last menstrual period.

The researchers said that they will
look for the changes that women go
through during menopause, such as
lifestyle, eating habits, personality,
amount of physical activity and atti-

tudes toward menopause.

Researchers will study partici-
pants’ lifestyles and diet, measure
body weight and fat and monitor
physical activity and physical
strength. “They will use behavioral
questionnaires that had been pre-
viously used to study the risk factors
for heart disease in men," Costello
said.

The questionnaires pertain to
lifestyle and personality traits that
identify type-A personalities. “Type-
A’s keep hostility and anger bottled

up, are under stress and feel as it they »

are battling against time,” Costello
said.

“Type—A personality has been-
studied very little in women.”

She will be looking for ways par-
ticipants in the study handle anger
and feel about their jobs and home
life. Smoking is a clear risk factor for
heart disease, Costello said. She sus-
pects there might be certain person-
ality trains linked to smokers.

The findings of the Healthy
Women’s Study will be compared to
other groups that have been given
the questionnaires.

Another factor that makes the
study unique is that this group is the
first generation of women going
through menopause who have
smoked cigarettes and taken birth
control pills, Meilahn said.

Estrogen, the main ingredient in
the pill, is used as therapy for women
during menopause and thought by
some to be preventive of heart dis-
ease. The pill is thought to increase
the risk of heart disease in certain
high-risk pre—menopausal women,
Meilahn said.

The study will include the gyneco-
logical and obstetric histories of the
women. It will not include the
administration of therapeutic drugs
for discomfort during menopause,
Meilahn said.

No Newsis Bad News

Last week, a survey of America's opinions suggested that
Americans have grown bored with all the news about Lebanon,
arms reduction and American involvement in Latin America.

They don’t want to read about it in the press; they're tired of
hearing about it on the radio and seeing it on the TV news.

Many news services, this one included, have received
increased solicitation by readers to print something good, to
print something nice. President Reagan also asked American
newspapers to take one week and only print the good things
that happen in America. This is an insult to the American
people and a pitiful attempt to avoid the disclosure of possibly
disturbing or unpopular facts.

News omission is just as _lethal to our society as news

‘ suppression.

We doubt that there wouldn’t be plenty of nicetiesto report.
But the media has a greater obligation to the people of this
country than to pander to the political whims of any politician
or to act as an intellectual sedative on the American
consciousness. .-

Granted, it is not easy, day after day, to even—handedly
wrestle with the issues of our complex society, political and
otherwise. These are troubled times in which we live. It would
be ajoy to report that no new group of men tried to bash in the
skulls of another group of men, that everyone had enough to
eat and that the weather will be clear and sunny forever. But we,
particularly as Americans, cannot shirk the responsibilities of
living in one ofthe most inﬂuential nations. Our decisions must
be made from the most informed position available. A demo-
cratic society is doomed to failure when its citizens become
politically inactive and lackadaisical. 2

Deaths and sufferings occur every day, and most people
don’t know about most of them. That’s probably why they d
-occur so often. - K . '

Local nightly news shows across the country generally spend
more time on sports and weather than on actual news items.
The great news shows such as NBC’s “Overnight” or Geraldo
Rivera’s “Good Night America” have been cancelled because
they didn’t make money for the networks. The news shows that
remain are aimed at the lowest common denominator, the
viewer who doesn't care about very much but will watch what-
ever is on TV and buy the products pushed during the com-
mercials. Journalists are essentially told that their audience is a
pack of morons and not to bother them with too many trou-
bling facts.

Ifwe, as Americans, are going to make the decision necessary
to properly rule our country, we must continually strive to get
the full story behind the headlines. This is a never-ending task,
but if it is not attempted, news services will continue to treat us
as ignoramuses who only care about “happy news.”

Good night and good news.

Letters To The Editor

Pitt Business
Prof supports
nations unions

Your lead editorial of Feb. l5,
entitled “labor Pains” reflects an all
too typical misguided view of the
current state of U.S. labor relations.
First, in my opinion, it contains sev-
eral errors of fact. While there have
been some union officials who have
faced charges and investigations
(most notably the president of the
Teamsters, which is not affiliated
with the AFL-CIO) the majority of
them have never been accused of
anything worse than poorjudgment.
What corporate official is innocent
of similar accusations?

Second, your assessment of the
role of unions does not take into
account several very important
points. The adversarial relationship
which characterizes union-
management relations is the result of
conflicting goals; management‘s
goal is to maximize proﬁts and the
union's is to maximize worker
benefits.

Only when the goals of each
organization become compatible
does the relationship become coop-
erative. ln the Chrysler case, the two
parties‘ goals were identical — find a
way for the firm to survive. Now
when Chrysler's financial status is
improving, it will be interesting to
observe just how cooperative both
parties will be.

Excellent, innovative labor con-
tracts can result from an adversarial
relationship; what the parties must

, strive to avoid is a dysfunctional

combative stance. Integrative solu-
tions to seemingly impossible dilem-
are goals which collective
bargaining was designed to, and
often does, achieve. Over the past
few years, union-negotiated con-
tracts have reflected concessions in
wage levels and work rules never
before observed.

In I983, 37 percent ofall contract
settlements resulted in either no
wage increase or a negative adjust-
ment. - The average union wage
adjustment was a 2.6 percent
increase, down from the I982 figure
of 3.8 percent. Additionally, work-
rule concessions designed to result in
increased productivity are included
in numerous contracts. This seems
to indicate that many unionized
workers are indeed “willingto yield
a little.”

While it may be true that some
union officials are not so ﬂexible in
their negotiations as the situation

- seems to dictate, there are probably

just as many company officials who
are taking advantage of the current
state of the economy by asking for
concessions they really don’t need to
survive. It's no wonder union offi-
cials are not willingto negotiate con-
cessions when they see U.S. Steel
buying Marathon Oil instead of
reinvesting in capital improvement
or when the average General'Motors
worker's, profit~sharing for I983
equals absout $600 while the average
GM official’s proﬁt-sharing bonus
was $30,000.

object to
pornography

“Not A Love Story” is unworthy
of the attention it received Sunday
evening, Feb. 26, at The University
of Pittsburgh. The_film pretends to
study seriously the problem of por-
nography, but is in fact nothing
more than a feminist morality play.
The message is that white women
and perhaps some white men will
find salvation for body and soul by
becoming trendy, burgeois femi-
nists. The protagonist, stripper
Linda Lee Tracey, undergoes a
metamorphosis from bare-
bottomed Little [Red Riding Hood
to anti-pornstreet preacher to con-
scientized little sister.

En route to conversion, Tracey t

enters the studio of porn photo-
grapher Suze Randall to pose for
porn pics, she says, to experience the
degradation in which the subjects of
pornography are forced to live. Her
“conversion” is deprived of any
credibility by her demeanor in Ran-
dall’s studio and during the debrief-
ing session with big sister the
following day. Tracey‘s street
preaching in front of aporn palace is
as contrived and hokey as any of the
“plots" in the porn flicks lavishly
illustrating “Not A love Story."
The film is shown in three reels.
One could view reels one and three
sequentially and never know that
reel two had been omitted. Reels one
and three contain most of the ther-
apy sessions for consciousness rais-
ing. Together they are a unit, and
they probably constituted the first
form of the film. Such pale fare
would never draw an audience. so
clips of hard-core porn were spliced
together to create reel two, and the
expanded film was touted as an

important anti-pornography
statement. L if

"A thesis reiterated in the film
insists that one must “know" (or
view) perversion and degradation in
order to subdue the rage with which
women must live in a male-
dominated world. This thesis is spe-
cious and should be rejected. The
thesis had to be invented to provide
a rationale for the pornography used
to attract an audience for bourgeois
feminist group therapy sessions.

“Not A Love Story” is not about
pornography. The producers never
define pornography, and viewers
should notice, too, that the film
focuses almost exclusively on white
women discussing the exploitation
of other white women. Black, brown
and yellow women, male homosexu-
al: nd children are all part of the
pornographic scene. Presumably
theyare as exploited and degraded
as their white female counterparts,
but neither film clips nor discussion
touch these subjects.

“Not A Love Story" cannot pro-

vide a useful basis for the discussion _,

of pornography. Pornography in
this film is used as a pretext to pre-
sent intelectually trendy white
women talking about the problems
of being female in a man's world.
Pornography belongs on the femi-
nist agenda as a problem to be ana-
lyzed and attacked. Unfortunately.
this film offers no insight into the
dynamics of pornography and little
hope that the blight of pornography
can be diminished.

We write together, a woman and a
manna black and a white, one of
urban origins the other from small-
town America, both ordained
clergy. Our quarrel is not with real
feminists nor with the close scrutiny
and discussion of pornography but
with bourgeois feminist propaganda
which uses material it claims to

deplore to attract an audience for

itself.

From Where I Stand/ Chris Blosso

Opinions

James Watt was the best thing for Environmentalists

An odd feeling came over me the
other day as I read the daily news-

paper: I really miss James Watt. 1"

don’t miss him for his policies. I miss
him because he was James Watt. He
was a godsend for every newspaper
pundit, every liberal (and some con-
servative) magazine writer and every
political junkie throughout the
country. When Watt spoke, every-
one listened.

With James Watt leading the Rea-
gan Revolution at the Interior
Department, Washington-watching
was a supreme joy. Now, without
those Coke-bottle glasses and a face
cartoonists swooned over, life isjust
that much duller. Watt was outrage-
ously entertaining in a world of mil-
quetoast politics, and I for one
couldn’t wait to open the morning
paper to see whom Watt had har-
pooned the night before. I know that
the Beach Boys miss James Watt
since he made them heroes last
summer, but the jury is still out on
whether or not the Beach Boys were
worth defending.

I even miss Ann Burford, the erst-
while administrator of the Environ-
mental Protection Agency. Ah, the
Ice Queen, the cool executioner of

the president’s policies. Burford’s
thinly veiled contempt for the press
and for environmentalists in general
made her the perfect reincarnation
of Madame de Farge, dutifully knit-
ting while whole EPA programs
went under the blade.

Life is not the same without the
dynamic duo, the terrible two. Bur-
ford took the fall for the administra-
tion’s policies to be replaced by Mr.
Clean himself, William Ruckel-
shaus. Ruckelshaus, you might
remember, midwifed the EPA into
its respectable infancy in the early
1970s, and his bona fide credentials
as a defender of themenvironment
quickly took the EPA off. of the
front pages and out of the congres-
sional hearing rooms.

Watt made one speech to many
and gave way to William Clark.
Clark has no experience but is ines-
timably loyal to Reagan. Clark will
never embarrass the president,
which is why he got the job. Both
Bills are able men in their respective
ways, but both are deadly dull,
dull, dull.

That dullness is why, I suspect,
environmentalists secretly regret
seeing Watt and Gorsuch sacked. If
they don’t, they should, because Jim

and Ann did more _for the environ-
ment than any political figure in the

last two administrations. They, by
their words and their deeds, made
the environment an issue again and,
in doing so, managed to awaken
environmentalists out of the self-
congratulatory torpor into which
they had lapsed by theclose of the
1970s.

Numbers are instructive here. The
Sierra Club in 1980 claimed roughly
l80,000 members, but this member-
ship jumped to almost double that
by 1982 —— the most rapid member-
ship growth in 10 years. The
National Wildlife Federation added
200,000 new members of its own in
this same period, and a number of
new organizations emerged during
the first years of the Reagan
presidency.

The apparent Reagan administra-
tion antipathy toward cherished
environmental programs also gener-
ated notable increases in public con-
tributions to environmental
organizations. Every time James
Watt opened his mouth, the cash
came pouring in, a circumstance
that must have gladdened the hearts
of many environmental leaders. And

A restrospective on Reagan

The Constitution gives us as regis-
tered citizens the right to elect a new
president every four years. There is
nothing that says we have to give the
president eight years. As voters, we
often hear experts telling us a presi-
dentreally needs eight years to put
his policies in place. This is not true.
Our current president, Ronald Rea-
gank has shown us that in just four
years, a president can put his policies
in place. But where has the president
really lead us? In the short run,
maybe to a better place, but in the
long run, after he is gone, to a much
worse one, I feel. He has charted the
wrong course. '

Ronald Reagan, no doubt, is the
consumate politician. But what this
nation needs is not a politician; it
needs a leader, a person with a long-
term vision. True, the economy is
better now than when Reagan
entered office, but we also have
record deficits that won‘t go away.
They hover over the economy, wait-
ing to fall and ruin the recovery.
These deficits are no minor problem
and require attention. They won't
disappear if the economy gets better,
because with deficits so huge, money
for investment in our industry will
remain scarce/as interest rates con-
tinue to remain high.

Federal Reserve Board Chairman
Paul Volcker repeatedly states that
interest rates will not come down
until the deficit comes down. But
how can deficits come down when
revenues from taxes stay low as a
result of low industrial production?

Production remains low because
there is little money available at
manageable interest rates to help
expand production. All this is a
result of the government having to
borrow money to cover the high
deficits. A mouthful, yes, but it is a
serious problem that Ronald Rea-
gan has lead us into. For a quick
recovery, it worked — just in time
for the 1984 election ~— but in the
long run, 1984 and beyond, when
Ronald Reagan will not be up for
reelection, the deficit question could
prove to be disasterous. But that is
just domestic affairs; the worst is yet

\
i.

to come!

What no one seemed to realize
when he voted for Ronald Reagan in
1980 was that Reagan is an idea-

logue. He really believed in the
monolithic, rational Soviet Union.
The man is absolutely paranoid
about the Soviet Union. And where
has this taken the U.S.? Failed arms
control talks with little immediate
chance for resumption and a. mish-

mash of adventurism over the globe. '
_ The Soviet Union is no paper tiger

and will not be bullied around by
anyone. They must be treated like a
superpower. On the one hand,
Ronald Reagan claims’ they are
behind and in control of every leftist
movement in the world, running the
whole show; then, at the arms table
and in the Middle East (the Soviet
equivalant of Central America),,he
treats them like a second-rate power.

He bullies them in one arena and
excludes them in another. This is
madness! What if the U.S.S.R. came
into Central America with a peace
plan and a multinational force made
up of East Blocnations for El Salva-
dor? The U.S. would be furious and
probably risk war. But the Soviet
Union has done no such thing in the
Middle East, where the U.S. has,
and continues to, parade around like
it was our own backyard. The
Soviets have no troops there. Why is
Ronald Reagan so paranoid?

At the arms table, the situation is
no better. The U.S.S.R. and U.S.
have differing policies for the use of
nuclear weapons. Ours is deterrence;
the Soviet is a combination of deter-
rence and defense.

Their main concern is to prevent
another invasion of their state, a fate
the U.S. has not suffered in many
years. And we certainly never suf-
fered the physical and human des-
truction the Soviets did. These two
differing policies will require differ-
ent weapons systems. There is no
need therefore to match weapon for
weapon with the Soviets. As‘ long as
the U.S. can carry out its nuclear
strategy, what difference does it
make what the Soviets possess? This

is a goal we should strive for in stra-
tegic arms talks. This is something
we are to decide in,November.

In Europe, the problem is greater
and more complicated. The Euro-
peans wanted the U.S. This would
guarantee their safety, they believed.
But now it seems they are rethinking
their original decision, and why not?

What purpose do the weapons
serve? Are they not redundant? The
Soviets have said repeatedly that
missiles placed in Europe by the
U.S. would be regardedas an attack

from the U.S._if used. But let’s at.

least examine the weapons first. The
cruise missiles "are truly second-
strike weapons. It takes them
approximately two hours to reach
their targets, clearly no first-strike‘
weapon. The Pershing II’s take only:
8-10 minutes to reach their targets
(possibly inside the Soviet Union).

This can be viewed as a first-strike
weapon, especially if you are a
Soviet decision maker. These wea-
pons give them no warningtime. It
cleafly is ‘a destabilizing Weapon.
Their presence alone may cause the
Soviets to launch a first strike in the
event tensions run high between the
two states, just because of fear that
the U.S. could use them and the
Soviets would be helpless if they
were not first taken out.

The U.S. has tactical weapons
that linlg conventional defense to
strategic defense, but they are not so
destabilizing. Reagan‘s hard line
only exacerbates a Soviet leadership
already in transition and fearful‘ of
his policies. Browbeating will not
work.

In Lebanon, some 270 Marines
died for no good reason, especially
not for peace. There hasn’t been
peace in the region for 15 years.
Wars have already been _fought‘to
try and bring peace to the region.
Clearly, the same policy will not
work again.

An approach other than force
needs to be put forth. Further, the
U.S.’s mission was ‘never deﬁned.

all this without a single fried-chicken
dinner.

Reagan and company not only
stirred the slumbering environmen-
tal movement into action but also
may have assisted environmentalists
organizationally over the long term.
The president's preference for
limited federal government action,
paired with a sense of open hostility
toward environmentalists held by
some administration officials,
forced environmentalists to look
else where for help. Turning away
from their traditional focus on the
federal government, environmental-
ists suddenly discovered hidden
strengths in the states and localities,
and most major environmental
groups are now heavily organizing
at the grass-roots level throughout
the nation. This kind of support is
tough to build, but it can also be
highly durable over the long run,
and this tactic will not only make
environmentalists less dependent on
federal officials but also more effec-
tive politically at election time.

Thus, the Reagan administration
unintentionally and paradoxically
rejuvenated the environmental
movement. For all this, environ-

mentalists should give thanks. Other
presidential candidates profess
greater fealty to environmental
ideals, but none have done more for
the environmental movement than
the man in the White House and his
lieutenants.

thanked them.

Their experiences overthe past
three years ,have also reminded
environmentalists that elections do
matter. Along with most of us, I sup-
pose, environmentalists share the

,comfortable cynicism and main-

stream wisdom that elections are
superﬂuous to political power in
Washington. The major political
parties are supposed to be Tweedle-
dee and Tweedledum, pale centrist
imitations of one another. But the
Reagan ‘election reminded environ-
mentalists that, though elections are-
flawed mechanisms for public con-
trol over government, they do decide
who gets to run the federal show.
The 1984 election promises to be the
most ideologically polarized in
many a year. Environmentalists did
not forget the lesson of 1980; neither
should the rest of us.

as an intervening, illegitimate power
with no viable interest and thus
attempt to discredit it — witness the
embassy ‘bombing, the marine
bombing and the constant sniper fire
and shelling. It would be similar if
Syria brought forces into Canada to
stop a civil war.

Also, Gemayel is about to fall and
sits atop a government that has no
authority. When the original consti-
tution was drawn up, the ethnic and
religious percentages were vastly dif-
ferent than now. There must be
equal representation brought to the
area. We have it here in the U.S.‘,
why not in Lebanon? "

Finally, the U.S. is pulling out of a
region in which it should not have
been in the first "place, and it may
lose credibility as a result with the
nations that did support us. So in
reality, the U.S. has lost a lot, not
gained.

In the Caribbean, the U.S.
invaded Grenada, micro-power of
absolutely no threat to the U.S. All
the weapons found were not high
tech, many were vintage. The run-
way, while capable of handling mil-
itary planes, also could handle
jumbo jets for commercial use.

Grenada is an island that survives
on tourism, which previously was
serviced by boats only. Planes would
have helped increase income. With
this greater wealth a middle class‘
would have a better chance to grow.

Middle class is the seed of demo-
cracy often times. No guarantees _on
this, but wouldn’t it have been better
than imposing a way of life on them.

Would we like it if someone did that . .

to us? Isn’t that why we protect our-
selves as a nation, to preserve our
way of life? '

Finally, what if Nicaragua has
elections and the Marxists don’t' win

-it all? What if they do? Democracy

says nothing about Marxists not
being allowed to take part.

Democracy is freedom of choice
and elections are scheduled for

November. Just think, we could end i .

up holding the bag in El Salvador!
This is where Ronald Reagan has

lead us. Great, huh? The right ’

course? No! Don’t listen to t ose
who tell you the election is already
sewed up. That’s not democracy
when someone tells you your choice
doesn’t count! As the famous saying

goes, “It's not over till the fat lady I i

sings.” ,

This may sound to some as less
than pro-American. I believe this to
be just the opposite. Not once did I
advocate not being firm with the
Soviets or letting the world go to hell
in a handbag. What I did advocate is
a more realistic approach to the
Soviets and the world.

This is no longer the ’20s and ’30s.
This is the l980s and relations
among nations require a skilled
craftsman, not an idealogue who
still thinks the way he did years ago.
Consider all the choices, not just the
front runners. They aren't necessar-
ily the best; they just happen to be in
front. Your decision is important.

Ranger Club teaches martial arts

The Pitt Ranger Club and campus police‘ officer Curtis
Smith have combined forces in an effort to build self-
confidence and physical strength through the teaching of the
martial art Jujitsu. Smith believes that martial art training
“provides one with an increased level of self-confidence and
good health.”

Cpt. John Maples, an airborne ranger and infantry officer,

said that the members of the club have had an opportunity to

execute small unit tactics and fire small weapons including the
Ml6Al rifle and the M60 machine gun. “There is a lot more

patrolling than most people will ever realize, and ifthese lead-

ership skills can be developed, the individual becomes an asset
to any management position,” Maples said.

The Pitt News, Monday, February 27, 1984

By Daryl Davis
For The Pitt News

(Editor's note: Daryl Davis is
president of Pitt's Black Action
Society.)

In 1982, Pitt’s Admissions Office
reported that a grand total of nine
black students were admitted to the
School of Nursing. In 1983, the
number reported was an accurate,
but lonely, one.

Pitt’s black student population
consistently decreases as each aca-
demic year passes, and the percen-
tage of black students admitted
becomes relatively smaller each
year. The College of Arts and Scien-
ces, the largest school within the uni-
versity, however, has reported a
progressive increase in overall first-
term freshman admissions.

In I983, the number of first-term
freshmen admitted was reported as
1,917. In 1984, that figurejumped to
2,093. Of those students admitted
under regular admissions in 1984,
only 88 were black. In 1981, CAS
admitted only 97 black students
under the regular admissions policy.
By I983, that number had fallen toa
reported 32.

The Admissions Office ‘reports
that both the School of Nursing and
the School of Engineering have
shown similar low numbers in
admission of black students.

i The problem is not.only that of
decreasing black ad_missions but

‘Since providing equal
educational opportuni-
ties for black students
is a top priority, it fol-
lows that we must
ensure excellence in
this area. ’

--Jack Daniel

also of the disparity between the
number of blacks admitted through
CAS and those admitted through
the University-Community Educa-
tional Program (U-CEP).

The U-CEP program recruits
those students who do not meet the
traditional standards for admission
to the university. These non-
traditional students have lower
board scores, less-than—acceptable
academic records or are in need of
financial assistance.

“The U-CEP program actively
admits three-fifths more black stu-
dents than CAS does,” said Dr.
Mary Ann Bishop Coffey, director
of the Affirmative Action Office.
“U-CEP actively enrolls an average
of 225 students per year," said Gail
Austin, director of recruitment for
U-CEP.

The majority of olack students at
Pitt have graduated from inner-city
high schools. Many schools in the
Pittsburgh area, which have pre-
dominantly black populations, are

. Black enrollment declining

not on the same academic level as
other high schools. The predomi-
nantly black Westinghouse High
School fell at the bottom ofthe scale
on national standardized exams.

“The black student does not see a
reflection of himself in the class-
room, either in his peers or his pro-
fessors," Curtiss Porter, former
chairman of the black studies pro-
gram, said. “The black student is put
into an environment with no black
professors and few black students in
the class. How can he feel
comfortable?” 1

Many black faculty and adminis-
trators are concerned about the stu-
dents of these schools. The inferior
high school environment often does
not prepare the student for college
demands.

“Most black students are receiv-
ing inadequate schooling as far as
basic academic training is con-
cerned,” said Dr. Jack Daniel, asso-
ciate dean of the Faculty ofArts and
Sciences.

Many concerned black faculty
members and students believe that
the university should make basic
plans to help the students already
here.

- “This university strives for excel-
lence in everything that is considered
to be a top priority,” Daniel said.
“Since providing equal educational
opportunities for black students is a
top priority, it follows that we must
insure excellence in this area."

“The university needs to reassess
its commitment to the black stu-
dents,” Austin said.

“I believe this is ridiculous, for

Now, BAS has no cultural program

BAS and the board also debated
the group’s Pitt News advertising

The committee will serve not only
blacks, but handicapped and other
minority students as well. It aims to
get minorities involved with student
activities and will also attempt to
deal with more general issues, such
as sexual harassment on campus.
“They all have problems and
needs that are overlooked,” art
said. “It's really uncomfortable for
minority students to be a minority in

“Now they discuss [problems]

Black Action Society President
Daryl Davis sees the BAS working
in conjunction with the new commit-

be any overlapping of duties.

“I can‘t put a parallel between the i

BAS and that committee,".. Davis
said. “Our major concern is academ-1
ics first. The committee will be try-
ing to get students involved on
campus.”

"We [BAS] are trying to pressure
the administration into setting up
more pre-college programs for the
black and minority students," Davis
said. “Pitt should initiate an actio
for finding outewhy.” »

Georgetown and Providence. Peo-
ple are finding out that Pitt’s for
real, we have a real chance of win-
ning the tournament.”

Pitt travels to the Capital Centre
to play the league-leading Hoyas
Wednesday night. The Panthers find
themselves in the middle of a hot
race with Connecticut and Provi-
dence to stay out of eighth place in
the conference. Seton Hall has the
cellar clinched. -

The two teams that finish eighth
and ninth when the regular season is
completed play each other in the
first round of the tournament. The
winner will be matched with George-
town in the quarter-final round, a
scenario that none of the three
welcomes.

Avoiding that will require the
breaks that have not come the
Panthers’ way often enough. But the
team is playing more solid basket-
ball, and they think those breaks‘will
eventually come.

“We’re confident that we can beat
anybody in this league, and that feels
good going into the [Big East] tour-

k Panthers miss the breaks

nament,” senior guard Billy Culbert-
son _said.

Pitt’s offense of late has turned to
an inside attack, while defensively
they have proved themselves capa-
ble of variety. Saturday, they
switched from man-to-man to a two-
three zone to a one-three-one zone,
seemingly at will.

The emergence of Pitt’s front line,
center Keith Armstrong and for-
wards Clyde Vaughan, Chip Wat-
kins and Andre Williams, makes
Pitt ( 1 5-10, 5-9) appear to be a legiti-
mate contender when the conference

tournament is played next week in

New York City.

‘,‘Our people inside [Armstrong,
Vaughan, Williams and Watkins]
‘are playing great," Allen said.
“Keith [Armstrong] played great
again. We showed that we can play
man-to-man defense, too."

“We’re also finding out that we
can't play good and expect a win,"
Culbertson said. “We have to play
great. We get no breaks from
anyone. We would have at least 20
wins right now if we had any
breaks." 7

Lady Panthers clinch first

By Laurie Kubli
The ‘Pitt News

First place position held by as
many as four teams simultaneously,
the hallowed position in the Big East
women’s basketball conference has
finally been comfortably filled by a
single team.

The dust has settled, the Lady

Panther basketball team has pulled .

away from the melee. Thanks to a
62-48 win at Boston College (I l-I4,
2-6) on Saturday, the Lady Panthers

(15-l 1, 6-2) take a No. 1 seeding into .

the conference championship this
weekend.

Holding a slim lead at halftime —
27-23 — Pitt pulled away on the
strength of guard Stephanie Collins’
outside shooting.

“Boston went into a 1-3-1 zone
[defense]," Saurer said, which
opened up the longer range shoot-
ing. “Stephanie Collins broke open
the game. She shot six field goals
and helped put the game away.”

ce’s 26 points and 1 1 rebounds are in
line with her averages, buther feat is
a repeat of last season, when her 21

“They’d have two or three on Jen-
nifer, but we’d adjust to whatever
they did," Saurer said. “Their
defense was primarily a man-to-

man, but Kim Tirik did a nicejob of

[controlling the] tempo."

Tirik, Pitt’s assist leader with 175,
was not limited to her point-guard
responsibilities and tossed in 11
points as well. Boston was led by Biz

I// The in Nws

Jeff Jelic‘s performance at the
Eastern Wrestling League cham-
pionships at Millersville University
this weekend showed why the
Panther grappler is worthy of
respect.

Although Pitt finished sixth in the
team scoring, Jelic breezed though
three opponents en route to histhird
EWL title and Outstanding Wrest—
ling honors voted by the leagues
coaches.

“I never have seen Jeffas strong as
he is now," Pitt coach Rande Stot~
tlemyer said. “He really looked
awesome.

“I think the coaches recognize
Jeff’s consistancy and that is why he
was voted outstanding wrestler.”

Jelic opened the tournament with
two falls. The senior from Mt.
Lebanon pinned Jeff Miller of
Cleveland State in 4:50 in the first
round and took care of Clarion’s
Scott Hall in 4:29.

That brought Jelic into the finals
against Penn State‘s Eric Brugel,
who earlier this season barely lost to
Jelic, 3-2 in dual—meet competition.

This time, Jelic increased the margin
to 7-3.

“Jeff‘s matches weren’t super as
far as being highscoring,” Stottlem-

yer said. “But it is a great‘

accomplishment."

Jelic’s title was expected, but Stot-
tlemyer was pleased with four
Panthers who placed in the top four
spots. Kyle Nellis took third at 126
lbs., while Joe Throckmorton (142),
Joe Bond (158) and Jack Uppling
(I90) placed fourth.

“Kyle did a nicejob,” Stottlemyer
said. “in his second match (against
Bloomsburg’s Rocky Bonomo, who
beat him, l2-l), he was taken down
and had to play catch-up."

Earlier, Nellis shutout Dick How-
ell of Lock Haven 7-O. After the loss,
the sophomore won two matches in
the consolation bracket, edging
Penn State’s Scott Webster 8-7 and
again beating Howell, this time by a
ll~7 margin, to gain third place.

Lady Panthers hit goals in Dixie 

By Wes Cotter
The Pitt News

Pitt's Lady Panther gymnastics
team spent the weekend on the road
and came home with a wealth of
experience and a new team scoring
record.

Pitt faced Georgia and Kentucky
on Thursday night and came away
with a loss and a win (Georgia
l8l.25, Pitt 177.4, Kentucky
169.55). Pitt traveled to Florida on
Saturday and posted a new team
scoring record in an effort that
wasn't quite strong enough to topple
the strong Florida team. Pitt lost
(187.1-180.4).

In spite ofthe two losses, the team
eclipsed one of its major goals of the
season, which was to score a I80 or
above. Lady Panther coach Donna
Sanft said that losing to teams as
strong as Georgia and Flordia won’t
hurt Pitt.

Sanft said that the 15th-ranked
team last week had scored a [80, and
passing this goal should move Pitt
up in the rankings, despite the loses.

“I think the kids performed well,
and it was really good practice,”
Sanft said. “We’ll have to travel to
regionals; these kinds of away meets
toughen up a team. It was a positive
performance.”

 

    

cps:-\4

y, February 27, 1984

The’ Lady Panthers faced two
toughteams, but they also faced the
biggest crowds of the season.'Sanft
said that the crowd at the Georgia
meet was loud and one-sided. She
commented that to encounter a
crowd of this kind is an experience
her team needs. She said the crowds
here are small, and a team that wants

to compete nationally needs to get

used to lots of noise.

“The Florida meet was fun; they
had about 95,000 people there, and
they were a good crowd. They went

nuts when Lisa Shirkfinshed her bar 0

routine," Sanft said.

Shirk, the team’s most outstand-
ing performer, scored a 9.7 on her
bar routine at Florida and 9.5 on the
bars in Georgia. Sanft said Shirk
and Alisa Spector were both under-
scored in the meets this weekend on
the bars.

‘?The girls just shook their heads
at the Georgia meet when thejudges
gave their scores for the bars and
floor,” Sanft said. Thejudges’scores
were correct, Sanft explained.
Judges are just afraid to give scores
as high as 9.8.

Sanft went on to say that she
thought before the meet that South-
ern scores were inflated, but her
team soon learned that Southern
judges take the maximum amount
away from a score for mistakes.

Pitt has not reached the level‘
where it i-s mistake-free. The Panth-
ers had three falls on the beam and
one on the uneven parallel bars for a
total of 2 points in penalty points.
Sanft was enthusiastic when she said
that her team could reach 182 if it
could cut down on their mistakes.

Sanft said that her girls were very
tired this weekend from traveling to
Georgia and then driving to Florida
before the meet on Saturday. But in
spite of this, Pitt beat its all-time
scores in three of its four events and
missed breaking the fourth by tenths
of a point. 0

Sanft said many members of her
team really came through with good
scores this weekend; the vaulting
was very good. Babby Flock, a
senior, tried a new vault —— a layout
Tsukahara —— and scored a 9.2. Also
scoringwell were Jackie Calderone,
Debbie Debkowski and Alisa
Spector.

Sanft said that her team learned
quite a bit over the weekend and will
be much better off at regionals and

possibly nationals. Sanft said that
the equipment on which Pitt com-
peted this weekend was different
from the kind they are used to and
just the experience of competing on
unfamiliar equipment will help the
team when it really counts.

You’re kiddig...

Syracuse head basketball coach Jim Boeheim goes through the motions.

By Todd Erkel
The Pitt News

SYRACUSE, N.Y. -— The Pitt
kIen’s‘l5a«sketball team picked, sliced
and squeezed the Syracuse Orange-
men for 25 of 40 minutes Saturday
night, and still they came away two
shots shy of an upset win that would
have left them higher than the Car-
rier Dome ceiling.

Down by nine early and then
ahead by as many as l2, the Panth-
ers came out sleeping, discovered
their playing feet 10 minutes into the
game and at times looked as if they
were poised to embarrass the
nationally-ranked Orangemen right
there in front of a senior apprecia-
tion night crowd of 30,356.

But Clyde_ Vaughan's 12-foot
jumper with 33 seconds remaining
and a desperate but promising heave
by Billy Culbertson at the buzzer

both missed, and the Panthers relin-.

quished a 66-65 win to Syracuse.
Culbertson’s attempt — like the
game .— could have easily gone
either way. V
“I don’t know about you guys, but
that last shot looked awfully good to
me...for a long time," said Syracuse
head coach Jim Boeheim afterward
in the Orangemen locker room.
Roy Chipman, a pleased yet bitter
Panther head coach following the
game, wondered aloud whether cir-
cumstances beyond his control -
the officiating and a rule change —
cost his team a big road victory.
Vaughan looked ready to play a
great game, even as the Panthers
went down early 18-9 and shot a

torrid 6-I0 from the field and a per-
fect -2-2 from the free throw line in
the first half to finish the first half
with 14 points.

But it was a different Clyde

Vaughan that took the last minute ’

shot, and ‘both he and Chipman
thought they knew why.

Vagighan took a pass with ll min-
utesto play in the game and drove to
the basket for what looked like a
dunk that would have put the Panth-

ers up nine and may have let the air \

out of the Dome and the Syracuse
students inside.

Enter Syracuse’s freshman bull-
dog Dwayne “Pearl" Washington, a
l90-pound guard who learned to
play defense in Brooklyn school-
yards, where fouls are called only to
keep the morticians off the courts.

The Pearl climbed up on Vaughan
in mid-dunk and the two crashed
hard to the Syracuse playing sur-
face. Vaughan hesitated a minute to
reconsider and then continued with
the game. But he played the next
nine minutes as if he left a little of

‘himself below the basket.

“I got a little tired after that and
just lost \ my concentration,"
Vaughan offered as explanation for

‘ the shooting slump he dived into fol-

lowing the midair meeting with
Washington. ,

Chipman wanted more than an
explanation though.

“l thought it was definitely a fla-
grant foul," he said. “There are a lot
of ways you can grab someone. You
can grab them by the arm instead of
pounding him into the ground."

Vaughan missed his next three
free throws and his next two jump
shots and roamed the court a
stranger to his earlier self. Still,
when the Panther braintrust decided
to hold the ball fornearly two min-
utes and go for a last shot, Vaughan
remained the logical choice for the
hero.

“It was real tense,” Boeheim con-
fessed after watching his nationally-
ranked posture flash before his eyes.
“When you are down by one, that’s a
heck of a risky play."

The Panther’s strategy was
shaped more by the rules than the
risks, though. Because the game was
televised, each team was limited to
three time outs, and by the time Pitt
found themselves . with a final
attempt at the juice, Chipman had
cashed in all three of his time outs
and was left to watch his senior
guard throw up a prayer.

“If we have a timeout with : I7 left,
we would have been able to re-
establish our positions for the final
play,” said Chipman. “That’s where
the TV killed us.”

But before Chipman cancels his
cable contract, he should remember

that the Orangemen did their part to
get back in the game.

Syracuse used a pressing full-
court defense — a defense that
handed the Panthers easy shots ear-
lier — to give Pitt a turnover attack
that totaled an unlucky 13.

“It was something thatjust had to

be done,” said Syracuse senior Gene A

Waldron. “There was no way I was
going to lose this last game [at the
Carrier Dome].”

Waldron and Culbertson each fin-
ished the game with l0 points for

Pitt two shots short of upset

their respective ‘teams, and the two
conducted a running dialogue with
each other on the court.

Culbertson fell to the court after
his last-second miss, and it was Wal-
dron who stood over him. \

“That [talking] has been going on
for the last few years,” Waldron
said. “It makes the game interesting.

“I think I got the last laugh
tonight."

Somehow, the joke never made it
over to the Panthers locker room.

SYRACUSE, N.Y. -—- When a
team loses a basketball game by
one point after dominating" play
for almost its entirety V the way
that Pitt did Saturday night at

Syracuse —- disappointment is
supposed to consume‘ the
defeated.

The dejection was there in the
Panther locker room following
the Panthers’ 66-65 loss to Syra-
cuse, but one could sense a feel-
ing of pride and accomplishment
‘among Pitt’s players.

The Panthers pushed the No.
16 team in the country to its lim-

its under the roughest of condi-

Pitt overcomes dejection

, tions

in the form of 30,356
Orange addicts before
succumbing.

The notion that good things
come to those who work hard
has held true for the Panthers in
recent weeks with big wins over
Notre Dameand Villanova, but
the heartbreaks of the past two
Saturdays (losses at St. Johns
and Syracuse) remain.

With it has come a hope.

“lt reminds me a lot of two
years ago, when we won the East-
ern Eight [now Atlantic l0] tour-
nament," Allen said. “We
struggled with winning games
during the regular season but
played great during the tourna-
inent. I think it would be possible

to do it again. ~u.
