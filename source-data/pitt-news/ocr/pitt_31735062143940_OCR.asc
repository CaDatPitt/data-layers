School Urged
To Repeat Past

Performances

“Buy a Bond of Thanks” will be
the slogan for the Pitt Victory
Loan drive beginning November
5 and‘ ending’ December 8.

“We are conﬁdent that the stu-

dents in all branches of the Uni-

versity will stand‘ behind. the
drive,” said co-chairmen Betty
Jane Wood and Norma Wallin.
“This will be the last chance to
ﬁnish those p~artly—ﬁlled. stam-p
books or buy that bond with a fu-
ture. We need the co—operation of
each student if we are to maintain
the splendid record we have.
achieved in -other campaigns.
Peace has returned to the world
and to Pit_t————let’s~ say our thanks
with a bond.” _

Last year the bonds sold at the
University bought -a “duck,” an
amphibious truck, to take ﬁghting
men into battle. This year they
will provide vhospital trains for
returning wounded.

A different campus organization
will operate the bond‘ booth each
day of the drive. Members of

. these organizations are a-sked to

make their contributions between
9:30 and 3:30 o’clock on their par-
ticular day.

A tentative list of the schedule
for the ﬁrst week follows: Monday,
November 5, Student Council;
November ‘6, WlSGA;
Wednesday, November 7, ~Men’s

, Council; ’I‘ihursday, November 8,

YWCA; Friday, November 9,
YMCA.

‘Complete details of the drive

‘ will be published later by the

committee: Emerson Tenpas, Rich-
ard Hargrave, Helen Arnold‘, Lar-
ry Bogart, Larry I_-llazeltine, Mar-
gie Dixon, Ma-e Boyer, and Sue
Nichols.

Don’t mi.-ss this last chance to
jump on the “bond-wagon”!

Get Your Date

For Soph Hop

November 9 

Your dream is here! It’s the first
big college dance with orchestra,
ballroom and all the trimmings.
November 9 is the date; Schenley
Hotel is the place; Clyde Knight
is the band leader. All you need
is a date!

The Reconversion Romp, spon-
sored. by the sophomore class, will
give the students their opportu-
nity to put Pitt back on its social
feet. Now the transportation prob-
lem is on the wane‘; a big‘ attend-
ance is expected.

“The size of the Schenley Ball-
roomwill give -everyone room to
really swing out,” said Helen Reis
and Zelma Schmidt, co--chairmen
of the dance. “We have ﬁgured
that even with a maximum at-
tendance, each couple will have
three square feet of ballroom,”
they added.

The feature attraction of the
evening will be the awarding of
“a post-war dream” to a person
attending the dance.

“You won’t have to cash in your
war bonds to come; in fact, you
don’t even need to sell any sugar
stamps,” Bernard. Puet, business
-manager, said.. “The admission is
just $2.75 per couple, and you’ll
have until 9 o’clock, November 9
to borrow the money.”

Chancellor Elected

Honorary Member

At a luncheon meeting in the
Hotel .Schenley on Monday, Chan-
cellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald was

presented to the Robert Kennedy‘

Duncan Club, a social and scien-
tiﬁc club of Mellon Institute, as
a newly elected honorary member.

Dr. Fitzgerald was presented by
Dr. P. B. Davidson, chairman of
the club’s committee of honorary

In making the presentation, Dr.
Davidson said in part: “Dr. Fitz-
gerald has had a distinguished
career in education, and his

prominent connection with the

Grant Received
For Research .

A grant of $3,000 from the Re-
search Corporation has been re-
ceived by the University to enable
an extension of investigations con-
ducted by Dr. Klaus Hofmann, as-
sociate research professor of
chemistry. This investigation, a
part of the research in” the natural
sciences supported by an earlier
grant from the Buhl Foundation,
is designed to clarify the action
of biotin, -a vitamin of the B-
complex group, the chemical
stI'uc’0ure of which Dr. Hofmann
helped to work out several years
ago.

Dr. .Hofmann -came to this coun-
try in 1939 as a Rockefeller Foun-
dation Fellow at the Rockefeller
Instit.ute for Medical Research.
The war’.s' outbreak interfered with
his "return to the Federal Institute
in Switzerland, where he had~for-
merly assiste-d with graduate study
in organic chemistry. For two
years he was a member of a group
at ‘Cornell Medical School which
solved the problem of the biotin
structure, a project complicated
by the availability of only a few
milligrams ofmaterial. Since then
he ha-s been engaged in research
which led to the discovery of a
way to synthesize “oxybiotin,” a
compound which may be used to
partially replace biotin.

hold all future assemblies with the
enthusiasm they merit.”

‘Bishop Pardue’s address Will of-
ﬁcially open the post-war Pitt as-
semblies.

Born August 9, 1899, Bishop

ice at Trinity Cathedral.

, The Eighth Victory Loan drive begins M-onday on ‘bur
campus, which means that once again we will be solicited to
“buy bonds, to “Buy A Bond of Thanks.” There will without
i doubt be a number among us who will resent themconstant per-
sistence ofcommittee members urging our purchase of bonds.
And for that reason, let us take stock of our present situation
and séejust why we must continue the purchase of bonds.
Our government is greatly in need of funds to pay off debts

that are coming due, for war production delivered in the last
ivmorrths of the war. The cost of hospitalization. and rehabilita-
§,tion for-our wounded runs into millions. Then, it costs money
to bring our boyshome, muster them out, and administer the
“GI Bill of Rights, plus the fact that money is also needed to
 -keep our occupation troops in Europe and in Japan.

   

  

 
 

  

  

  

  

    

  
  
  

  
  
  

   

the cost of a total war.” -

c How true his statement is. Some people, however, have the
feeling that because V-J Day has been proclaimed, the war is
V-over". The war is not over, until we clear ourselvesof any debts
we owe———ﬁnancially or otherwise. And in order to, clear these
debts as quickly as possible, We must further our efforts in the
purchase of bonds. ‘

  
  
  
 
  
   
  
  
   
 
   
  
   
   
     
   
   
 
 
  
  
  
 
   
 
   
    
  
  
 
    
 
  
    
     
 
  
   
   
     
  
   
   
      
    
  
 

ﬂationary danger is ahead; We have bought bonds.-during the
"war tosiphon off inﬂationary money. Through our savings, and
jtthrough price controls, weaverted much of the effect of inﬂa-

tion. Now, we must continue to avert such inﬂation. - We must
"be immediately aware of runaway price rises even when the
behavior of prices may seem to suggest that the dangeris past.

1 Thus, when you are asked to buy, bonds, remember that
- there’s still a job to be done. Lincoln, one of our greatest presi-
dents of the past, described the job in his second inaugural
address, which is-as appropriate today as it was in the Civil
_War era, “T-o strive to ﬁnish the work we are in, to bind up
the Nation ’s wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the
battle, and for his widow and orphan . . . to do all which may
achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves
-and with all nations.”

This year Student Congress has inaugurated a plan to revive
the student assemblies. In the past two and a half years, Pitt
: has lacked these assemblies due to wartime conditions, and as a
result the students havemissed an important part of their edu-
.cation‘—an education gained through acquaintance and associa-
tion with some of the country ’s outstanding personalities.

I With the aid of a large appropriation from the University,

Studen.t.Congress now makes available this education.

H Full support and cooperation of the student body is neces-
sary to make these assemblies function successfully. During
past semesters a common campus complaint was the lack of
activities in which students could express their school spirit and
loyalty. This, then is an excellent opportunity for all of us to
show that our pre-war enthusiasm has not died and that we are
‘wholeheartedly ready to back our Student government.

, _ The ﬁrst ofthese assemblies will‘ take place tomorrow at
:11 :30 o’clock 111 the Stephen Foster Memorial. The Right Rev-
erend Austin Pardue, Bishop of Western Pennsylvania Diocese
has been obtained as the initial speaker.

Pre-Social Work Club

The pre-social work club will
meet today at 3:30 in the lounge
on the thirty—second ﬂoor of the
Cathedral. There will -be a panel
discussion on “Social Problems
Which Make Social Work Neces-
Saryps A V. _ .

Participating in the discussion
will be: Ann Sablowsky, Hazel
Thomas, Jean Walcowski, -Miriam
Drucker, Shirley Butler, and Peg-
fgy Likovitch. :

All those interested in social
work are invited to attend.

Letter To Editor
To the Editor:

With the rapid advancement of
radio and television, 'Pitt is with-

out even a beginners’ course. Col- :

leges are known to- expand‘ with
the changes in time, and radio is
one of the greatest advances in
shortening of the time relationship
of education. Education by radio

is an advancement that can never" 1 I ''
any other ‘

be compared with
known means of self education.
The greatest educators of all
fields‘ of social and ap-plied sci-
ences, of the arts, of government,’
-of the world leaders can become
available for teaching through ra-
dio. Students can absorb" much

from le~ctures on subjects by lis- “ 

tening to men who are masters in
their chosen ﬁeld. 1 .
Dr. I. Keith ‘Tyler, Radio Edu

cation Director a‘t Ohio State uni-A

versity, said of education in ‘a

speech recently at Carnegie Lec-T

ture hall, “Education is always
putting the tack where the car-

pet was yesterday.” Pittsburgh is.
known as the “Pioneer City of

Radio.” It has st-artion KDKA, the
world’s initial radio broadcasting
station.

The major networks of America
are represented by radio outlets
in the Pittsburgh district. I know
for a fact there are many students
here interested in -some phase of
radio work, but are disappointed

because the University’ has noth-I

ing to offer.

The University of Pittsburgh
should become the radio educa-
tion center of America with radio
courses of all types, with its own

‘radio station located on one of the

ruptper ﬂoor of the -Cathedral.

Wouldn"t it be wonderful to hear, '
“This is the University of Pitts-u
burgh s‘ta:tio~n,. PITT, located in the ‘

Cathedral of Learning in Pitts-
burgh, ~Pennsylvania!”?
‘Michael Felack’.'

Editor’s note: The School of
Engineering oﬁers db elementary
course in radio in the Evening
School given by Dr. B. K. Hovey.
It is E 53 and E 54. There is also
a course in radio and electronics
offered in day school, given by
Professor Williams. This course is
open to seniors and graduate stu-
dents. In addition, a course in
radio script writing, instructed by

QMC History

, The University announces the
signing of a second contract with
the United States Army whereby
the history department agrees to
write the history -of the Military
Planning Division of the Quarter-
master Corps in the second world
war. ,

Dr. John W. Oliver, head“ of the
department of history, will be in
charge. Dr. John J . Geise, pro-
fessor of history, will serve as
chief historian in Washington and

« at QMC installations in three other

cities. A staﬁ of ten research his-
torians is provided for in the con-
tract. The project will take 22
months.

Earlier, the University agreed to
prepare the history of Research

— and Development for the Engineer

Board, Corps of U. S’. Engineers at
Fort Belvoir, Va. Dr. Geise will
oversee both projects.

Chiang Kai-Shek, to give him
“bargaining power” in his deals
with the Chinese Communists.
One could go on for a long time
listing a few of the non-Russian

slaughter.”

Signed,

Hugh W. Weston,
Thomas Kerins.

“I care not, Mr. Weston and Mr.
Kerin, to open a controversy over
your injection of British and Dutch
imperialism, which is entirely, ir-
relevant to the question of Rus-
sia’s seeming inability or unwill-
ingness to cooperate fu-lly with the
United Nations in laying a sub-
stantial. foundation for a lasting
peace. Your accusation of ‘Am-
erican iimperialism’ can be an-
swered no better than by the
Filipinos. Try telling it to them.
I think if you will check your
sources of information you will
learn that your ‘thirty-nine Am-
erican divisions’ are Chinese
troops trained by American offi-
cers toﬁght against Japan.

It is my earnest hope, Mr. Wes-
ton and ‘Mr. Kerins., that Russia
and the United States may reach a
common basis of understanding
and agreement very soon, without
which the United States would be
in danger of becoming a nation
more isolationist than ever before.”

Ghosts and goblins have been
frequenting the fraternity me-
nages lately, -with Halloween par-
ties, hilarious high-jinks, and gay
galaxies of mirth predominating.

Big news of the week is the
TPA open house for all veterans
and-fraternity women on campus,
this -coming Friday, November 2
at the TFA house at 4914 Center
avenue, from 3:30 to 5:30. Big
time for all.

Last Friday night found the
AZTA and their dates at a hal-
loween dance at their house.
Pump-kins, an-d orange .and black
trimmings gave the house that
spooky appearance. The Phi Mus
had their Halloween party on Sat-
urday at Belleﬁeld Dwellings in
their apartment. With a sc-avenger
hunt and food—-ginger bread and
cider——they had a gala time.

Tea dances seem to be in style
this week. ‘The Kappas had the
Phi Gams to their Dithridge street
house for a Halloween dance last
Monday night. Th-e Delta Zetas en-

., textained the Fijis (they certainly

get around on) Thursday evening
at a dessert dance. To climax the
tea dances -for the week the Chi Os
are having the PiKAs this af'ter-
noon.

The A E Phis had a dinner at
their apartment last Wednesday
with the alumnae coming back to
see them. The keynote of the aﬁair
was singing and lots of fun.

If you want to ﬁnd any of the
Thetas on Saturday from 1 to 5
they will be at their house playing
bridge and listening to Pitt beat-
ing Purdue.

The Beta. Sigs had the ﬁrst roller

D ‘Iskating party of the year on Sat-

urday. They really had a big week
end with their dance on Friday
night at the Ba-lconades.

' Big plans -are in store for the
Tri Delts at their house party
of November 3.

Phi Sigs are giving their annual
Dessert Bridge on Sunday, No-
vember 4 -at the Schenley ball-
room.

Come on all you women and
support the 12th ﬂoor fund. The
proceeds of the bridge are go-
ing to be donated‘. to the 12th ﬂoor.
So we will set you at the bridge.

By Marty Wekselman

Big things are brewing on fra-
ternity row, but this ‘reporter
knows nothing about them. Evi-
dently the hammer and chisel
crews in the Tuck Shop have
scared the frat men clear out of
town. At any rate, the missing
men have evidently retired to the
solitude of the libraries, because
locating them has been like Carl
Hughes trying to see Shaughnessy.
Luckily, however, a few snatches
of information reached me via the
grapevine, so here goes.

The handsome ex-lieutenant
wandering around the halls is Pi
Lam Chuck Miller, back in school
after his discharge from the army
air forces. Back in town, but only
for a Week, is Phi Ep Ed Gold-
farb, who now sports a red stripe
on the sleeve of his navy blue
jumper.

First Halloween celebrants were
the SAE’s, who held a party for
the Kappa’s last Friday. ’ The
Sigma Chi’s had a wonderful
weekend at the Slippery Rock
summer home. ‘(Out of season,
but nice.) Speaking of weekends,
the Delt’s will have a bowling
party and house -dance on the
coming up. The A Phi A’s are
currently hatching plans -for a big
series of Winter social events.

The news blackout of the Phi
Gam’s, Phi Kap’s, Phi Delt’s and
PiKA’s can mean only one thing.
Those boys have evidently stolen
away to mountain training camps
to perfect monstrous teams, in-
tended to murder all opposition
for the IF football cup.

Perhaps there’ll be more news
next week.

French Coed Tells  Eluding N azis;

Finds America

By Ruth Weinstein
Snow and dates are what Helene
Ragner, Pitt’s pert French coed,
likes most about America as con-

‘trasted with France.

Snow never falls in Paris de-
clares tousle-topped Helene. “I
love the cold,” she insists em-
phatically. -

As for dates in the American
sense of the word they do not exist
in France, that is, unless a girl
wants it known she is planning
marriage. Schools are not coed;
boys and girls meet at parties and
‘events arranged by mothers. The
French form of dating starts at
about twenty-one.

Letters from home, Helene says,

indicate that these taboos are
breaking down since the war, but
couples, if they do go out, double
or even triple date.
. No boy would ever dream of
whistling at a girl. If he did, he
would be thought to have bad in-
tentions. Helene relates how some
French sailor friends of her fam-
ily who are stationed in the U. S.
are shocked by American girls.
“Someone really ought to tell
them,” she says gravely in her
liquid accent, “that things are not
as bad as they think.” V

Helene has been in the United
States for four years. Born in
Paris, she lived on the right bank
of the Seine and attended a pri-
vate school near the famed Arc
de Triumphe.

Helene’s mother is French and
her father was an American news-

paper correspondent who served in

France as a soldier in the ﬁrst
World War and who returned to

marry his French sweetheart and
settle in the country. Many of
Helene’s friends were the chil-
dren of such French-American
marriages.

As a correspondent for the Chi-
cago Tribune, her father met Hit-
ler, Mussolini, and the Duke of
Windsor. A photograph of her
father Ibesi-de Hitler taken in 19-37
at Berchtesgarten is among the
Ragner’s picture collection. “Hit-
ler was friendly towards Ameri-
cans,” Helene recalls. “Musso-
lini, on the other hand, was very
high—hatted.”

Until the invasion of France,

 

l And Puzzling

Helen lived in Paris during the
school year. She remembers
studying English and higher math-
ematics in the sixth grade. Her
sister started Greek in the same
grade. She divided her summers
between the sea shores of Brittany
and her mother’s home in the
Pyrennes.

After the German invasion her
mother and sister and she ﬂed to
the south of France where they
lived for a year in a hotel ﬁlled
with French officers and their
wives. She remembers how every-
one had to pretend that they ac-
cepted Petain.

When she came to America, one
big delight was to ﬁnd “real.food”»
abounding. In the hotel where
she stayed for a year, she ate
“noodles and carrots and noodles
and carrots.” There were no fats,
meats, sugars, or vegetables to
speak of.

Her “greatest joy” was to ﬁnd
America free after the suffocating
atmosphere of occupied France.
The friendliness of the people as-
tonishes her.

Helene went to Mount Lebanon.
High School. The ﬁrst.year she
barely understood anything that
went on.
quickly she graduated at seven-
teen.

As the daughter of a French
mother and an American father,‘
she has the citizenship of both
countries. When she is twenty-
one she will declare which citizen-
ship she wishes to adopt. Asfar
as she is concerned, the decision is
already made—Ameri’can.

Biochemistry
Fellowship
Granted to Pitt

The University of Pittsburgh has
been -selected as one of the ten
lea-ding universities in this country
for postgraduate studies in the
food. and nutrition ﬁeld by Stand-
ard Brands Incorporated. J. L.
Bogert, Vice President, in charge
of research and development, has
announced the granting of a fel-
lowship in biochemistry as part
of a ﬁve year grant of that com-
pany.

The fellowvship is to be given
each year to a graduate with high
scholastic record who wishes to
continue: ‘his studies in biochemis-
try. Fellowship-s. in other universi-
ties are being granted for this
stud.y, as: well as for bacteriology,
organic chemistry, chemical engi-
neering, biology, and food tech-
nology. The fellowships will be
distributed to Pitt, ‘Cornell, Har-
vard, Indiana, Massachusetts Insti-
tute of ‘Technology, Princeton,
Rutgers, Stanford, and Yale.

In announcing these awards, Mr.
Bogert said: “The purpose of
Standard Brands’ fellowship plan
is to en-courage young men of sci-
entiﬁc ability to equip them-
selves to -do research in the ﬁelds
of food and nutrition. The war
has caused. a large number of able
college students in technical
courses to give up their studies
with the result that a shortage of
research scientists graduating dur-
ing the next few years is threaten-
e-d--a serious situation, as this is
the period in which the country
will need the utmost effort in tech-
nological development.

Selection of the students for
these fellowships will be made by
each university where the fellow-
ship is awarded, entirely free of
any inﬂuence by Standard Brands,
Mr. Bogert emphasized. Neither
will there be any restriction or
speciﬁcations imposed -on the stu-
dents in their fellowship work by
the company, Mr. Bogert added.

Holding the terminal positions on the Pitt line are freshmen Bill
McPeak and Leo Skladany. Both boys have stepped out of high school
football directly into the college grid and have obtained and held
ﬁrst string positions throughout the season. Playing end is an all

around job since the end must be¢

tackle, receive
passes and run the ball from a

pass. That means he must be tall,

Bonavita Holds
Swim Classes

A water-safety program under
the direction of Emil Bon-a-vita is
being presented by the Physical
Education Departmen't of the Uni-
versity. The time is 4 o’clock every
afternoon and the place is the
Tree’s Gymnasium Pool. This pro-
gram will continue until December
10. Mr. Bonavita is the director of
the Red Cross Water ‘Safety Pro-
gram in Allegheny -county. He has
planned a program which is es»-
pecially adapted to the novice.
Starting from -scratch, the pro-
gram begins with the various basic
strokes and is concluded with in-
struction in water safety and life-
-saving. All men enrolled in the
university are eligible to sign up
for this -course. Here’s a chance
to obtain ﬁrst class swimming in-
struction for nothing.

The plan of instruction is so de-
vised_ that each student obtains
the maximum of instruction. The
beginning swimmers are und-er the
supervision of Mr. Bonavita at
the shallow end of the pool and
are taught the fundamentals. At
the deep end the advanced swim-
mers are ‘taught form and Water
safety by Johnny Pager. No em-
phasis at all is. placed on competi-
tive swimming. At the completion
of the course those swimmers
showing enough skill will be cer-
tiﬁed as 'wlater-safety instructors.

Pitt PanthersTackle Purdue 
At Lafayette On Saturday

Pitt’s victory-hungry Panthers will take another journey this week, their second and last of the
1945 grid season. Having lost four out of their six engagements the Red and White clad Pitts-

burghers will next trade passes and plunges with Purdue’s high-geared eleven at Lafayette,

Ind. Saturday afternoon, Purdue will be the second Western Conference eleven out of the four

to be met by the Pittites this fall, all have been favorites to erase the locals.

In the previous

clash with a conference entry, the Panthers were dropped by Illinois 23-6 in the season opener
at Champaign. Purdue and Pitt have not tangled since 1941 when the Boilermakers Walked

off with a 6-0 triumph.

The 1945 Boilermakers have
been led and also inspired by their
colorful head mentor, Cecil Isbell.
The youthful Isbell is one of the
most loved and highly revered
personalities in the entire Purdue
alumni. He and his ﬁne right arm
helped make Purdue a great team
in 1935, ’36, and ’37, when he be-
came one of the top pigskin pitch-
ers in the; Big Ten. Later Isbell

imoved into pro football where, in

ﬁve seasons with Green Bay, he
set National League football rec-

ords in yards. gained,_ in total

passes completed, and in the num-
ber of touchdown’ passes thrown
by one man.‘ The Isbell to Hutson
combination became one of the
most feared in the “pay for play”
circuit. He returned to Purdue in
1943 and was given a great deal
of credit for his team’s undefeated
record in nine games as he served
as aide to Elmer Burnham. In
1944, ‘he moved into the head coach
job and at 30 years of age is one
of the youngest college mentors in
the na.tion.

The Boilermakers who employ
the “T” formation boast one of the
shortest and speediest starting
backﬁelds in -college football. The
backline is built around freshman
Bob DeMoss who does all the Pur-
due passing and is a real handy-
man with a pigskin. Other back-
ﬁeld stalwarts are Isbell’s touch-
down twins, Sophomore Bill Can-
ﬁeld and Ed |C0dy. Canfield is a
shifty ball-toter who was moved
from quarter to half and has

proved his value by donating six

touchdowns to the Purdue cause

this season. Cody, a brushing 5.9
tailbacker has plenty of drive and
speed packed in his muscular
frame and he leads his aggregation
in scoring with seven touchdowns,
and was highly instrumental’ in
his team’s spectacular victory over
Ohio State. Dave Shaw rounds
out the backﬁeld at the righ half
spot.

The home team will have a tow-
ering line with all except one de-
fenseman going over the 6—feet
mark. Two Navy men share the
end positions. They are Bob Heck
at the left end and Norm Maloney
at the other terminal. Two major
letter-winners from last year are
mated at the tackles, Pat O’Brien
and Tommy Hughes.

Volleyball practice will continue
all this week and next, W. A. A.
decided at the Association. meeting
Monday. The ﬁrst volleyball
practice, held last Friday, was not
as well attended as was expected.

This situation may be due in

part to‘ the fact that announcement
of the start of volleyball was not
made in the freshman Phys Ed
class-es. This week the Phys Ed
instructors will give complete in-
formation of the tournament plans
to their classes.
_ However, sophomores, juniors,
and seniors are asked, here and
now, to come out for volleyball.
W. A. A. would like to have the
best tournament they have ever
had this year.

We are sure that Pitt women

‘want to support women’s athletics,

so here is the chance to do so. For
fun, for health and exercise, come
out right now for volleyball.

, The time schedule for practice is

as follows:

for Satu/rday’s contest to the undefeated Temple
contest Owls, by a score -of 6-0 at the Sta-
against dium, Saturday. It was a bad aft-
Powerful ernoon all around for the Pan-"

. their tackling worse, and the old

college try seemed: lacking. At
least they lacked the same zest

with which they tackled Notre.

Dame. ' . v

It was all Temple the ﬁrst half.
They pushed Pitt up and down the
ﬁeld and managed to push over the
lone tally of‘ the game ‘after Zim-

movan’s- fumble on the 24 yard line"

furnished them with the necessary
break. Phil ‘Slosburg, the fullback,

featured for Temple in this touch-f
d-own spurt. The only other im-. ‘
portrant offensive action came late ‘V
in the second. quarter when Slos- ’

burg caught a Skladany punt and

returned it from the Pitt 40 to the '

14. But Pitt held here‘ and, the
half ended. '  "
The second half was a different

story. Pitt completely outran and; A
outp-assed the Owl but lacked the,‘

zip to push the ball ‘over. With.

Wolff at the helm, the Jungle Cats I I

pushed to the Temple 8 before they

were halted. Then a sensational

runback of a punt by Robinson

again put ‘Pitt in Temple ‘terri-jg .-
tory but a Smodio pass was inter-.-2 .
cepxted and the Owls again tooki

over. Then late in the ﬁnal quar-
ter Pitt drove downﬁeld only to
have another Smodic aerial inter-
cepted. ‘Temple took over deep in
their own territory and froze the
ball as the -clock ran out.

If Clark Shaughnessy has ever done any second guessing he is

sure to do it before the Panthers meet Ohio State in two weeks.

Pitt

is facing the toughest part of its schedule and at the present in its

weakest condition.

least one week with a probable chipped knee bone, Ed Zimmovan was
escorted from the Temple tussel with a bruised shoulder and Billy-

Wolﬂf, ‘freshman quarterback, is out with a bad left shoulder.

Another Gamble

According to Mr. Shaughnessy
the Panthers will be out gambling
against Purdue just as we did with
Notre Dame. If‘we are going to
beat ‘the, Boilermakers the breaks
must go our way and the only way
to get the breaks is to go out and
make them. Temonoif was used

“Clark Shaughnessy decided to

box Saturday, but that isn’t a new
experience for the Pitt coach.
Back in his earlier days of -coach-
ing, Shag would coach from the
press box the first half then be
down on the field the second half.
When asked of the advantages of
coaching via phone, he replied,
“Six of one or a half a dozen of
another.” Despite that Shag in-
tends to stay there and if facilities
allow he will be in the stands at
Lafayette.

The Carlsonmen who will share
the responsibilities on the ﬂoor can
be called the Mutt and Jeﬁ of the
team. Apple is the smallest mem-
ber reaching the 5 foot 8 mark
while Hank towers over him by
eight inches. The little forward
also holds the distinction of being
the oldest veteran as far as play-
ing experience under -Carlson
tutelage.

A graduate of Ford City High
School, Nate came to Pitt with
only experience picked up in his
hometown’s gyms and IF league.
The Pitt speedster was too small
for the Ford City Hi cagers and
when he entered Pitt he took ad-
vantage of the lack of experience
and giant ball players and tried
out for the team. He proved to Dr.
Carlson that height isn’t a prere-
quisite of a star performer and
made the ﬁrst team. The Ford
City dental student is now await-
ing the gun to start his third year
on the Pitt Pavillion. ‘

Mr. J elf or Dr. Big better known
as “Hank” christened Harry Zeller
is the other half of the Panther
twosome. Hank is a graduate of
St. George Hi here in Pittsburgh,
where he was a star performer on
the hardwood. From St. George
he enrolled in the pre-medical
course at Washington and Jeffer-
son College. At W. & J. Hank

"held down a forward position for

two years and climaxed his career
with the Presidents by going to
the ’43 New York Metropolitan
Invitational Tournament where
they ﬁnished third. The following
year Zeller entered Pitt medical
school and spent his evenings in
his freshman year playing Muny
League basketball; then Uncle

year and Hank donned a blue uni-

We publish it because we think
it will, be of interest not only to
the members of the men’s and

instrument of service to its mem-

which it is situated.

“On the home-front side, the
Greek-letter .fraternity’s difficul-

The fraternity has been criticized
justly or unjustly on the score of
its alleged snobbishness; the men-
tal anguish it invﬂicted, if unwit-

frained from inviting to join; and,
until the fraternities began a
number of years ago to thump
themselves to correct this matter,
criticized on the score of the fra-

its members’ pursuit of scholar-

“And on the ﬁghting-side, the

during the war—as did colleges
