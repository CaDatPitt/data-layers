Union officials have found honoring Union sen-
iority principles and keeping pledges to hire minor-
ity workers are sometimes mutually exclusive
goals.

When the current
$600,000 off the budget of the Department of Phy-
sical Plant forced a layoff of 14 construction per-
sonnel, administrators were faced with a dilemma:

Should they risk losing $26 million in Federal
grants by laying off the men with the least seniority,
including the first nine members of minority groups
to be successfully placed in these positions, or risk
the ire of the Building Trades Council by instead lay-
ing off white men with more seniority?

Leland Deck of the Insurance Office said that
in this case, the Department of Physical Plant
would not lay off minority people and 14 white work-
ers were laid off.

If the University had laid off the minority work-‘

ers and been found not in compliance with-the Affir-
mative Action agreement which requires the Uni-
versity to hire minority people to be eligible for
Federal aid, the University would have lost a $26

participants in a four-day confer-

University’s Office of Special pro-

day at the Pitt Student Union.

The conference began yester-
day. /

Entitled “Captives of Socie- _

educate the University commun-
ity, legislators, judges, attorneys,
and religious leaders about the

off 1,200 people. not 14. Deck said.

Union officials complained of reverse racism ,

and violation of labor principles. Threats of strike
filled the airwaves 'when'one Union representative
told a radio reporter that workers would not re-
port to work after Thanksgiving vacation if the Uni-
versity did not restore the men to their positions.

Despite threats, the workers returned to their
jobs Monday. and a meeting between Deck and un-
ion officials was ‘planned for yesterday. Though he
said he had no idea of what union officials would
propose to him. Deck said that no formal com-
plaints had been filed against the University and
that he did not foresee an immediate strike.

Deck also said “the management will accept
the decision" of a third party such as the State La-
bor Relations Board if the Unions should file suit

’ and win the case.

University officials recognized the seriousness
of the problem; it was like “choosing between the
cliff and the deep blue sea,” Deck said.

Union officials could not be reached for com-

  SG Constitution o

by GLENDA MINSHULL
The Student Affairs Advisory
Committee approved the propos-
ed Student Government Constitu-
tion by an 8-2 margin last week.

For the text of the Constitution,
see page two._

The Constitution. if approved by
the undergraduate‘ student body

in a Dec. 6 referendum. will ‘take.

effect on the day of the election.
which has yet to be determined.

Public hearings on the Constitu-
tion will be held between 3 and 5
p.m. in room 524 of the Student
Union Thursday and between 1
and 3 p.m. Friday in Dining Room
A of the Student Union. A special
Constitutional Referendum Com-
mittee will conduct the Hearings.

 

The Referendum Committee,

’ composed of SAAC and Constitu-

tional _Review Committee repre-
sentatives, has established the
following code for the referen-
dum: All undergraduate full-time
students are eligible to vote. Stu-v
dents must show their ID’s and
validation cards. Polling booths
will be set up in the Commons
Room, the Ballroom of thelStu-
dent Union, and the Towers Lob-
by between l0 a.m. and '5 p.m.

(Students who have not received '

validation cards can vote in the
Student Union between 1 and 1:30
p.m.) ’ ..

Most of the debate at last week’s
SAAC meeting centered around
mechanisms for the approval of

budgets previously rejected by..

the Board. The consensus of the
group was that the elected Board

should have final authority over '
the appointed members of the Al- ,

locations Committee in a dispute.
In a compromise worked out

between SAAC and members of’

the Review Committee, the bud-
get procedure was changed to re-
quire four approving votes by
Board members to pass a budget
the second time ‘it is submitted to

the Board. Also, the Board has
one week to act on a budget after _ 
it/ has been rejected a second/_'
time. This procedure is designed ‘

to prevent indefinite budget de- A M f

Appears in "The Attic”

Harper juzzes up Pgh. night life

by CHRISTY AGNES MARN

What could be happening at the
Monroeville Mall on a crisp fall
afternoon other than Christmas
shopping or ice-skating at the in-
door rink?

The “happening” was entertain-
ment, Walt Harper’s Quintet play-
ing “funky” musical jazz capades
on the Fountain Courts’ elevated,
wooden open stage.

The Quintet’s attire of brown
slacks with matching vests over
long, puffy sleeved shirts and an
inscription of "Superstar” on
brown leather belts was as rich as
the texture of their music.

An enthusiastic audience sat on
concrete benches surrounding the
stage or stood around it; others
looked down from the second level
or stopped momentarily" on the
stairs to absorb every chord.

Cameras clicked and cassettes
whirred. Some persons smiled in
appreciation, patted their feet, or
snapped their fingers in syncopa-
tion to the rhythm.

Walt Harper, Pittsburgh’s top-
notch jazz musician-singer, ar-
ranger, composer, lecturer, 1969
holder of a number nine tennis
ranking, and a former jazz in-
structor at the University, runs
one of ‘the most popular night
clubs in the country today—Walt
Harper’s Attic and All That Jazz.

Since its June 25, 1969 ,incep-_
tion at 25 Market Place in down- A
town’s Market Square, the
bistro has hosted
large crowds which sometimes
stand in line for hours to hear the
versatile group alone, or coupled
with such performers as pianist

“Originally,” Harper, stated,
“we were going to open above
the Pewter Mug, but the"pres'ent
location, which was formerly the
Mystic Tearoom, provided the
right location and adequate space
for seating about 200 persons and
a dance area.” .

The decor includes a treasure-
chest, consisting of a large, red-
costumed brown Santa around the
Christmas holidays, and blow-ups
of famous music and acting stars
that are as nostalgic as red lip-
stick. ‘ ‘

In the downstairs lobby, which
leads to the second-floor Attic,
newspapers clippings of reknown—
I ed artists and events, of past dec-
ades line the walls. Outside isa

When asked about the influence
of music in his lifestyle, Harper
quickly responded, “Music has in-
fluenced all of my business deci-
sions since my business is music,’
beginning with the Quintet, which
is big business to the Walt Harper
Workshops I’ve presented which
involve music.”

The versatile musician whoused I

to play at the Hilton Hotel’s Kings
Court believes that “two essen-
tials to being a good businessman
are to have a good lawyer and a
good accountant. If you want to go
into the night club business, I sug-

I felt I had walked into an-
other land. The large enclosed
sunporch was stripped of rugs
and furniture. On the hardwood
floor were bowls of food: some
green slop that" looked like
thickened pea soup,
some brown doughballs. A half-
eaten popcorn ball had been
thrown into a corner.

"Yoo hoo. is anyone here?"

   
 

My voice echoed in the empti-
néss: I crossed my fingers no
one was home.

A tiny. dark-complexioned
boy. wearing no pants. came
running from an inner room. I,
would not escape my assign-
ment: he was unmistakenly one
of them. Though probably.not
yet three years old, he already
wore their trademark of a shav-

,, ed head and a thin. black queue.

My fears began to ebb when
Katyani, the mother of ‘Chibia-
bas (the trouserless kid) came
and welcomed me. Her pretty
Oriental face and her soft-spoken
manner were attractive, and I
accepted her invitation to sit
down Indian-fashion on- the
floor. '

Soon her husband Bibu. and.

Mahendra. "a fellow devotee.
joined us. A friendly conversa-

rice, ‘and

Krishna. It is comparable to the
Hindu culture.

All prasa/dam (food) is cooked
for and dedicated to” Krishna.
Prabhupada (an affectionate

   

name for the Spiritual Master)
teaches that Krishna would not
be pleased if his devotees ate’
animals; therefore they arelvege-
tarians. But Krishna does like
spices; so they cook with lots of
seasonings. '

The food is strange, but tasty.
On my first visit I ate from the
very bowls I had found on the
floor. The green slop was dal,
a spicy, thickened pea soup I
ate over the cold rice. (Did you
ever try to take notes and eat

sticky, wet rice with your fin-'

gers?. The devotees do not use
utensils.) " The brown dough-
balls tasted like unsalted Roman
meal bread.

To the devotees. such a meal
is plain: they" consider the
prasadam at,Sunday feasts more
scrumptious. At feasts I attended

‘we ate things like barats (pea

patties fried in ghee and refried
in‘charcoal), stewed apples and
plums (also tricky without a
spoon). and sweet milk thickened
with rice.

Tasty morsels or not. I often
wondered how they‘ ‘could eat
such: meals as a steady diet: each
meal I shared with them caused
me severe gastric discomfort!

Smoking, the drinking of alco-
hol, and the use of drugs are
taboo. Sex is only for husband
and wife and then only for
procreation. When the desired
number of children have been
born—usually no more than two-
the couple abstains from inter-
course.

When the children are grown.
husband and wife are separated;
the husband goes into intensive
religious training. ‘

Work is defined by sex as wo-
men are considered less intelli-
gent than men. Her brain is said
to weigh 32 ounces and the
males 62 ounces. though Bibu

assured me that Krishna found‘

tasks as cleaning the toilet and
«preaching equally important and
rewarded the completion of them
in the same manner.

Krishna children are sent to
special schools so that they may
gain spiritual as well as material
knowledge. 4-D (ministerial de-

today. Bibu said they would
fight in a religious war or in
one against some ."demoniac
ruining the world."

Devotees do not vote because
politicians “take intoxicants and
have illicit sex”; they would
not be good examples for the
people. But they would vote if
‘a Krishna devotee ran for office,
something Bibu said might hap-
pen some day.

Originating in India. the move-
ment has been in- the U.S. for
five years. though devotees‘ say
the religion is eternal. The theo-
logy has been handed down in
the Bhagavad-gita or Vedic scrip-
tures which instruct devotees in

tKrishna consciousness.

The scriptures teach that men
live an unhappy life on earth
instead of a happy one with
Krishna because they became
jealous of Him when they lived
in His spiritual kingdom. Want-
ing to be like~Him, they asked
Krishna to let them come to
earth.

Here they have lived for ages
in their misery, passing from one
material body to another—some-

V times human, sometimes animal,

sometimes vegetable_.

But Krishna is a just God and
He gives man a chance to enjoy
a happy life while on earth and
a chance to go back to the spiri-
tual world. One must simply
obey the rules of Krishna con-
scousness: dissociate from the
material world and associate
with the spiritual one.

Bibu says this-is done very
simply. First, insteadof living
for yourself, live for Krishna.
You need not go and live in the
temple, simply dedicate‘ your

.life’s work to Him. If you are

an artist, Bibu says you should
paint a picture for’ Krishna;
if_you are a_businessman. give
Him some of your profits.

ing and chanting) are two basics
in devotional service.

“Chanting is the basis of the
.Hare Krishna movement,” Bibu
said in an impromptu ‘sermon to
visitors. “By chanting God’s
name we are associatingwith
Krishna. The more we associate
with Krishna, the happier we
become. If we connect with the
Whole we’ll find happiness.”

Because man is always re-
incarnated when his old material
body dies, one who does not
reach purification in one life
has another chance in the next.
An advantage will be given to
someone who came closer to
purification in the last life; for
instance, Krishna children are

, believed to be devotees who did
not quite achieve perfection in
thelast life. -

The. smells of the prasadam

the temple; they mingle with the
heavy, sickening odor of candles
and strawberry incense. --

strain tosee what Mahendra is
doing at the altar. He,is.dedicat-
ling gifts that please Krishna:
flowers, prasaclam,' a fan, incense.
‘a handkerchief, a candle, and
rose water, with special dances.

He dedicates ‘the fan, a lovely

and down. he fans the altar,
then moving it in large, sweep-

round. He fans the devotees.

What kind of people become

to say life is so’ bad that he must
escape it by taking up the Cloist-

Krishna temple-dweller?

had joined the movement. I asked
out of curiosity. ‘

Most of these people were
young and. extremely intelligent,
and I could not understanduhow
they could believe in a religion
that appeared to give them only
some sort of temporary high dur-
ing chanting while it took away
most of their personal freedom.

It seemed most were societal
dropouts because they could not
find a role in life that made
them happy. Devotees are dis-
dainful of hippies and yogis try-
ing to find peace in “wrong

COLD BAPTISM startles numbing
" senses.

way," yet all groups seem to
be seeking and achieving the
same goal: happiness by ignor-
ing reality and concentrating on
the spiritual. Only the methods
of these groups differ.

Bibu, for example, dropped out
of Pennsylvania State University
and went to ,Hawaii, wherehe
married Katyani. They lived with
Mahendra and a few others.

“‘At the time we were living
on a farm,” he said. “We had
a whole paradise-—our own
beach (for surfing). fruits and
vegetables (we were surrounded
by farms); we didn't have to
work. .

“We were taking d’rugs—LSD,
marijuana-—for spiritual knowl-
edge. I was into mystical yoga
and meditating processes.”

Then the whole group visited
the local Hare Krishna'temple.
They liked it, according to Bibu.
particularly the ‘food but also
the chanting; they kept return-
ing. _

’ “Instead of meditating so
much, we chanted——more and

more, and more. We did it more, .

liked it more until we joined,”
he said.

It’ seemed to me he simply
substituted a mental high for
a chemical one. but Bibu in-
sists it changed his life. He says
he became cleaner and more
regulated as he began to follow
the life style dictated by Prab-
hupada. He gave up drugs and-.
alcohol. Most important’. he says.
his reason for living changed. .

“Basically.” he said. "I was
no longer living for myself.
I was doing it for Krishna. My
life became a liberating action
instead of a binding action."

[He said he also became “more
truthful, and peaceful of mind”;
he has developed “sincerity and
simplicity.”

Bibu was not surprised at the
results; he expected ‘them. "He‘s
developing and
training Brahminsi (for centur-

ies the priest or highest caste_

in India); This process purifies

   
 

‘ . -_ one ,in,to;‘t_he. rnodepf goodness.-"‘ J

 

Mahendra's story is similar.
Before joining the temple with
Bibu and the others. he read
widely of philosophy—0riental.
Plato. and Socrates-_—"trying to
assimilate the validity of life."

Krishna consciousness caused
him to abandon that path.

“I stopped speculating, stopped.
trying to figure it out. I started
accepting things.”

John. a- devotee for six
months, used to be a student in
Boston. He described his studies
negatively. “I was wasting my
time; for two and one half years
I wastaking the easiest courses
just trying to get through."

He sawdevotees .chanting on
the streets. talked with them.
and became interestedc.__W¢_V_,

“I went to the temple one
Sunday and then the next; I stay-

ed a week;” ‘John said. “Then I

 .- 9:2-,: .1.

went home.’ took an my m°.99-¥3*=*' ining room mouth or openly

out of the bank, flew to Los

Angeles, and joined the temple
there.”

Now he is working on the
Hare Krishna commune in West
Virginia; apparently he no long-
er thinks he is wasting his
time. / .

The stores go on and on. Ther-
esa had a "rotten office job" as
an audit clerk. She started going
to the temple, liked the chant-
ing, and moved in. Kutila was
forced to quit college; after
traveling around for a while she
decided to join the movement.

The Krishna movement has
given them all a~happier_ life,

 

  

and the happiness seems to cen-
ter on the chanting. One need
only look at the ecstatic expres-

-sion on their faces when they

sing to know that. Therefore, the

next question I asked was
why chanting was so pleasur-
able. » '

I found I was right in calling
it a non-chemical high. Mahen-
dra compared chanting to a good
trip on LSD, adding however.
that this was a pure and safe

; kind of trip.

"It's blissful.f' he said.

by STEVEN KAYE

 C ‘ Chairman of the Constitutional

 Review Committe

 purpose in writing this‘ column is to en-
fse, the proposed Constitution, which will be sub-
rriitted in a referendum to the student body Decem-
V6136,-I971. . '

Yet, there is a much more basic issue. Why
hould ‘today’sistudent be concerned with such an
pparently irrelevent institution as student gov-
ignment? Certainly, individual apathy on various
ssiies is understandable, but in the case of stud-
nt"government, I feel that the contemporary stu-
"e'nt«"s.indifference may be an error.

In -my view, student government is a viable
fechanism to dispel a portion of the frustration,
oneliness, and boredom that exists at the Univer-
ity of Pittsburgh. .

Just as a wholesaler acts as a representative for
eindividual retailers in dealing with the major
apitalistic industries, so student government can

d grievances of its constituents. Admittedly, an
nstitution cannot satisfy all of the individual’s

eeds,

Yet, often, an individual’s will is thwarted un-
éiirly by the complex or uncaring mechanisms of
ur‘ time. Basically, through recognized student
epresentatives, both faculty and administrators
lainjhave "some additional communication of stu-
ent sentiments. —

,;.-.Why was tuition raised without student con-
”ultIat_ion? What reason do department chairmen
live for the absence of student advisors on policy?
’W}lfIy'.‘can.’t student government afford free con-
certs or alternative entertainment with a program-
ming budget that exceeds $75,000? Why do so
rifivany groups! thrash. around the University fear-
nlffor their economic status? ‘

_ ‘I have no answers at this time. I only have a
fuggestion. I suspect that a concerned," competent,-

éaling with these problems.

‘Two ‘years ago, I met an upper-echelon ad-
nistrator at the original constitutional review
_9'nven,tion', which created our present constitu-
ion. He stated that he and his fellow administra-
ors" felt that. they could ignore the communica-

_ E-lg__.’IT.'-,1‘  became;  4‘ '  A   .

tlionstitution me

‘ct-"as. a ‘representative in handling the problems .

ctive student government organization can aid in,

'tsis it rt   0
tion from the student government president, since
he was not elected on a public mandate.

I wondered then who, if anyone, he would
consult for information on student affairs, if he
chose not to consult the democratically elected
student representative. V -

Do we want to prove this manright again? If
students will vote on Referendum Day. the ques-

. tion arises whether students will prefer a change

in the student governmentConstitution.

In late September, after months of concerned
interaction between the title student leadersland
the University administrators, the Constitutional
Review Committee was formed. The Student Af-
fairs Advisory Committee tSAAC. composed of
the presidents of BAS, IFC, AWS, CA, etc.) charg-
ed the Review Committee to examine and accept
or reject the present commissioner-oriented struc-
ture. - ' ’

During public hearings, the Review-Commit-
tee persued a new idea called the Board. With
the help of its faculty advisors, Drs. Seeberger,
Matthews, and Newman, Mr. McC1inden, and in-
terested students, the Committee composes a doc-
ument with a series of checks and balances and
guidelines for authority.

We hoped tonpropose a.system which would

avoid the quorumless, bickering sessions of the old ,

President-Senate structure. At the same time we
desired» to better define and restrict the powers of
office-holders under the present.-constitution.

- It is impossible for me to state- in this column
the complete reasoning ‘behind the document.
Therefore, the Constitutional Review Committee
will hold open hearings of explanation Wednes-
day (10-12 in' dining room A) Thursday (3:00-
5:00 in 524 SU) and Friday (1:00-3:00 Dining
room A) and will be interviewed on WPGH eith-
er Thursday or Sunday night.

Copies of this proposed constitution may be
‘found in 105 Student Union or in the Pitt News.

Before -I wrote‘ this column, an "administrator
informed me that Camus once stated that individ-

‘ ualsreceive the government they deserve.

If you wish to have the government you real-
ly deserve, vote on the Constitutional Referen-
dum on Monday, December '6, and vote again in
next term’s student government elections.

Editor's Note: This is a reply
to the Undergraduate Women’s
Union open letter.

The Undergraduate
Women’s Union:

The Student Health Service has
been working with the adminis-
tration and student groups on the
task of providing medical care.
Over the past years, the type and
amount of care has changed
drastically.

The number of visits has al-
most doubled, and new and
needed services such as gyne-
cology, contraceptive counsel-
ing, sex education, etc., have
beenx added. Facilities have not

l’age of Opinion”

been able to provide ‘sufficient
services to meet the demand.
Medical care is stillessentially
a one to one transaction. More
patients require more doctor and
nurse time and, therefore, more
money.

Old sources offunding (i.e. tui-
tion dollar) can no longer‘fin-
ance non—academic services, es-
pecially ones growing at such a
rapid rate -— gynecology up 300
percent over last year, no GYN
services the year before.

Some will ask, “Why not use
the Medical School or the Uni-
versity hospitals.” There is no
such thing as FREE MEDICAL
CARE. There is only a question
of who will pay the bill.

In spite of budget cuts, medi-
cal services have not been cut
back, but we have been unable

to meet the increased needs for.

gynecology, psychiatry, ortho-

 

 

Hinchliffe asks uwu
to workout solutions

pedics, and dermatology. While
steps are being taken to correct
his situation, we have been _forc-
ed to give the most urgent medi-
cal cases a priority.

The administration and various
student groups are attempting to

develop an equitable financing

program for needed student me-
dical services. One thing remains
clear: more services will, unfor-
tunately, cost more money.

I welcome the concern of
the Undergraduate Women’s Un-
ion in this matter which vitally
affects the health of all students.
I invite them to send represen-
tatives to meet with me, other
stude_nt groups, and administra-
tion officials to work out-accep-
table solutions.

Sincerely,

Joseph G. Hinchliffe,.M.D.
Director, Student Health Service

by RON LOZOWSKI
Feature Editor

Richard Brautigan has struck again.
The impish creator of the mini-marvelous
novel. Trout Fishing in America, has re-
turned to hook the unwary with the latest
outgrowth of his whimisical imagination,
Revenge of the Lawn.

In this collection of short stories printed
between 1962 and 1970, Brautigan presents
a glimpse of America that is both'penetrat-
ing and absurd, as the reader chuckles and
winces, rages and roars with delight . . .
and perhaps the realization that something

BOOK REVIEW

 

But at any rate, it is really a remark-
ably engaging conglomeration. Brautigan

I is possessed of a style as fresh and stun-

ning as any writer ought to be, simultane-
ously displaying a firm grasp of the tragic,
comic, and ironic. And the tales are con-
trived with such ingenuity as to leave crit-
ics gaping in awestruck befuddlement.

Often bordering on fairy-tale fantasy,
Brautigan’s work retains a sense of the
childlike which has escaped most of us
down all the days»-of intervening years. A
few samples could never hope to suffice,
but may at least serve to whet the appetite
of the uninitiated.

The title piece is merely an inkling of

 

what is to come; the titles alone. in fact.‘
are as uniquely intriguing as the tales that
unfold. ‘ '

“Homage to the San Francisco YMCA"
is a wondrous bit concerning a man who
one day “decided to take the plumbing out
of his house and replace it with poetry, and
so he did. . . . He took out his bathtub and
put in William Shakespeare. The bathtub
did not know what was happening." And
neither may the traditional reader—but
groping for the solution is half the fun.

Obviously, the surface stories are not
always quite so “ridiculous.” Frequently,
the humor merely serves as a pretext for
an underlying tale of utter poignancy. And
the variety is endless, from “Women When
They Put Their Clothes on in the Morning”
to “1692 Cotton Mather Newsreel.”

Ever so often. Brauti_gan hits the read-
er between the eyes with some genuinely
beautiful writing, as.in one of the lost chap.-
ters of Trout Fishing in America, entitled
"Rembrandt Creek: "Often I think about
Rembrandt Creek and how much it looked
like a painting hanging in the-world's larg-
est museum with a roof that went to the
stars and galleries that knew the whisk of
comets." Sheer poetry. as they say.

But Brautigan can be neither defined
nor-iconfined b~yrIIilﬁ€-IT€“vQFltlCS.' The individ-
ual reader must proceed at his own risk.
The wry wit and profound observations
await your glance, so abandon your precon-

_,,c,eptions; prepare to be deceived. And be-
ware—the Revenge of the Lawnis at hand.

The Paulists were founded
with the belief that each man is
a member of the community and
he contributes his own thing.
Each is an individual with his
own talents and he is given the
freedom to use them in his own
way. But not later. Now. '

For instance, during the no-
vitiate, ‘novices work in such
diverse areas as hospitals, voca-
tional rehabilitation céntcrs and
Universities.They serve as assist-
ant chaplains, co-retreat masters,
student teachers and psychiatric
aides.

Paulist Seminarians create
recreational programs, direct
“Days of Recollection” for CCD
students, direct film series, ex-
periment with the use of media
in the-liturgy as a preaching tool,
originate and edit the Paulist

by MARTY HELLMAN
Associate Sports Editor

  ‘The “cautious optimism" of Buzz Ridl last year has

"ball team’s prospect this winter. In his fourth year at
Piftt, Ridl believes that he finally has the material to re-
_.j turn the Panthers to a tourney for the first time since
. 1964. ' ' _

 l.“,We’re' not hiding any longer.“ says Ridl. “We're

‘,hoping to'be in a post season tournament.” _

Ridl’s statement is not a brash one considering the
-rtalént at his disposal this season. Four starters return
_’ from last year’s 14-10 team and overall nine lettermen
return. » I. I .
 ‘ Top scorers returning are seniors Kent Scott (13.6
-ave.), Paul O’Gorek (12.3 ave.), Mike Paul (11.4 ave.),
and junior Carl Morris (7.9 ave.). , ‘

A Two_big additions to the squad will be Cleveland Ed-
. wards, who sat out last year with a knee injury. and sopho-
more" Billy Knight. Knight was academically ineligi-
.ble' to participate as_a freshman.

 
  
 

North Carolina game this Saturday night via the Cam-
pus Bus. ‘It will begin service at 6:30 p.m.-and will
stop on Fifth Ave. in front of the Towers. Tipoff for
the expected sellout is 8 p.m. ‘ '

The bus will also provide service for approximate.-

ly one-half hour after the game. This service will be
in effect for all night basketball games. ,

 

   

. , Despite Knight's lack of exposure to college ball. he
*was recently honored by Street’s and Smith’s Basketball
Magazine as an honorable mention All-American.

Ridl praises Knight highly, though he admits, “I think

 he would be further along if he had played last year, but .

_he’s been coming very well.” '

_' Edwards is expected to lead the offensive attack and
,x"supply the team with leadership." according to Ridl-
 Two seasons ago, he led the Panthers in assists and set a
__ _Pitt record in the same category.

~ Three reserves from last year‘s team a'l’so figure

creased depth on the roster. ' ‘

“We have a lot of players with similar talents," he
stated. “We'll just have to use our strengths where we
can.”

Ridl recognizes the team’s weaknesses at this point.
“We’re not as good a rebounding team as I would like
right now, and the ball handling will have to flow a little
more. I »

Unfortunately. the team’ has suffered several set-

backs before the opener. Sparkplug Buzzy Harrison was
ruled academically ineligible, and Martin is recovering
from an ankle injury.

“Buzzy won’t be easy to" replace,” said Ridl, and

-we hope Mickey can recover fully soon.”_

The best assemblage of Panther hoopers in eight
years will also face the finest array of opponents in quite
a while. This Saturday night, second ranked North Caro-
lina will start the Panthers on the roughest part of the

will oppose Wisconsin, South Carolina (last year‘s ACC
champ) and participate in the Steel Bowl with Navy, Du-
quesne, and Wake Forest.

Ridl feels that only one more ingredient is needed to
make_this year Pitt’s most exciting one ever. "We need
the students to jam the stands for the garnes——it is im-
portant.” _ ‘ “

Aside from winning though, Grgurich also has the
job of preparing the frosh for their varsity stardom that

The 1-3-1 offense, which is also used by Ridl, will be
used, for the most part, to put the necessary points on the
board. Defensively, the Cubs will be in a “man-to-man

switching will occur with the man to man, ‘

S . An 8-3-1 record is nothing to sneeze at. Head
 Coach Dave Adams,‘looking forward to his fifth
' year as Pitt's wrestling mentor, believes the grap-
plers might very well better last season’s mark —
rinitiated by Pitt’s opener against powerful Michi-
-gan at the Field House this Saturday at 2 p.m. A

“-If we can avoid injuries. which have hurt us in
 past years. the team will be improved. Key injuries
1. have killed us during the Easterns (EIWA tourna-

77 .ment) the lastfour seasons." '

 Unfortunately. the injury jinx has already de-
“ .pleted the Panther depth chart. Freshman heavy-
 weight Carl Roba. an Ohio state champ. broke his
, leg playing football and is out indefinitely. Co-cap-.

' " tain Willie Saloky (167) has been troubled by a skin.

infection. which has limited his practice time. Side-
’ - lined by a knee operation last
winter, Steve Weiss. 118)
will require more surgery in
the near future. Weiss’ avail-
ability for the home opener
is undecided, depending on
when the operation occurs.

    

Despite the present dis-

R. P/TTNE I abled list, Coach Adams feels

that the matriien are well-stocked at several -

(weights.

"Co-captain Dave Wylie and Gary McClure
give us fine depth at 134. Weiss and (George) Bry-
antqare two of the best 118 poundersin the East.
Finally, we have five capable wrestlers at 167 and
177--Saloky. Craig Tritch, Wally Morrell. Jim Car-
amana, and Lamar Hudson.”

' Adams has a right to be optimistic. After drop-

Chatman finds himself in a three-waytussle
for the starting berths at 150 and 158. Senior Jim

an excellent fourth place performance at the East-
erns. Kevin Love, a two-time PIAA state champ,
ineligible as a freshman due to academic difficul-
ties, is vying for the 150 slot.

Although Pitt has compiled a respectable dual
meet record during Coach Adam’s tenure. the grap-
plers have continually flopped at tourney time. The
absences of the Mark and Randy Paynes, Ralph

Cindriches, Steve Weisses, and Pat Laverys have‘

not helped.

“I would hope that 'we’ll be a stronger tourna-
ment, rather than dual meet squad,” explained
Adams. “The NCAA tourney, preceded by the East-
erns, is the high point of a collegiate ‘team’s sea-
son. It is the top rung of the ladder for every wrest-
ler. ' 7 /

“There will be several young men in the line-
up who should improve match afte-r match. I’m con-

‘When Bill Grant resigned as the
swimming coach midway through
the ’71 campaign, he left the mer-
men floundering in the midst of
one of their worst seasons in
years. suffering from severe in-
ternal conflicts.

After nine months of intensive
recruiting and preparation, Dick
Bradshaw. the squad’s new head
coach. is anxious to reveal the
fruits of his and the team’s re-
building efforts. Their opportun-
ity' will come Saturday when they
face a Clarion contingent which
has not lost a meet in two years.

"We're optimistic,” comment-
ed Bradshaw as he viewed this
year’s ten meet schedule. "We
have 14 freshmen and that’sa
step in the right direction.

“We have a well balanced team

FVhat is a
quintup ler?

by JERRY MYERS
Sports Editor

While most Pitt’ fans are grumbling about the disap-
pointing’ season on the gridiron, the Athletic‘Department
has arranged to toss some pretty appetizing pacifiers their
way. The most elegant of these rolls around Saturday.

In. what shapes up as one of the best day-night quin-
tupler in Pitt’s history. The grap‘ and eager squads will
have their hands full when Michigan and North Carolina
invade this weekend. The Wolverines wrestle the grapplers
in an afternoon bout that is slated to begin at 2 p.m., and
then in the 8 o’clock night-cap the Panthers take onvwhat
some pre-season polls size up as the second best basketball

’» team in the country.

‘sf’ a‘_.

In addition, the gymnastic, freshman basketball and”

1 swimming teams also open their seasons Saturday afternoon.

Overflow crowds have far from .been a tradition at the
Field House, but in recent years the turnouts have signifi-
cantly increased. .-.'Four years ago, a few hundred diehards

" A: (if that) plodded their way up the hill to see the cage-rs.

take their semi-weekly battering. Those were the days of
Bob Timmons and a very mediocre brand of basketball at
Pitt. .

Today, following a crash rebuilding program engin-
eered by the present head coach Charles ‘Buzz’ Ridl, Pitt
h_as propelled themselves into the limelight as one of the
most improved teams in the country. With the help of as-
sistant mentors Fran Webster and Tim Grgurich, Ridl has
molded a squad that, with a few breaks, should see itself in
a post—season tournament this year. _

' But the first obstacle on the tourney trail is North Car-

fgolina, and the outcome of Saturday’s game will most likely
form the tone of the Cats’ ’71-72 campaign. Here is their

first chance to prove what everyone has been chirping about
— that the Panthers are a team to watch.

‘’ Student support is one of the biggest factors in the
success of any ca-ger squad. It is no coincidence that the
ACC (Atlantic Coast Conference) always sports some of the
toughest college basketball teams in the country, year in and
year out. Inevitably, twelve to fourteen thousand people
show up when a Conference game is on the slate.

This kind of support has extended passed the narrow
boundaries of the Carolinas, evidenced by the fact that,_ac-
cording to Pitt’s Sports Information Director Dean Billick,

they will be able ‘ to count on close to 500 North
Carolina fans at the Fieldhouse on Saturday. That’s a lot of
noise. ‘ ~

“The only way we won’t have a capacity-crowd,” com-
mented Billick, “is if the Pitt students don’t show up. We

have allotted more student seats than ever before. We en-

courage any reasonable signs to urge the team on. Come
early.” _

When Pitt basketball woke up its
-year with a couple of impressive, early season victories, a
new excitement permeated the basketball scene. The students
showed that they were behind the team and packedthe hill-A

  Track

By JANICE BUCCIGROSSI

When any track team loses

three top athletes in one season ‘ 

like Bryant Salter, Jerry Richey,
and‘ Smittie Brown, it‘s really
got to\be hurting. , p

Any team would be hurting,
any team except Pitt that is.

"If you lose fine athletes like
that it can’t help the team," re.
lated Pitt’s coach Jim Banner.
"But I don't think we're really

going to suffer a lot because we,
a have fine boys that will be do-

ing a good job as they have in

' the past and maybe even better.”

' Also adding strength to the
team are Banner’s topnotch fresh-
men recruits.

“This season we have one of
the finest groups of freshmen I‘ve
seen in a long time,” stated Ban-
ner. "Not only do we have the
quantity that we've had in the
past, but_ we also have the quali-
ty.” . , ’

Banner will _be» using the com-
bination of last year’s. veterans
and this year’s new prospects to
full advantage during the ’72 in-
door track campaign.

Returning‘ this season are Gary

Risch and Tom Daly who are_

considered by Banner to be “the

‘ most consistent indoor sprinters.”

The approximate best time for
both tracksters is 9.09. '

Taking the hurdles this time
around for Pitt are Rick Carosi-
elli and Andre Harris.

Harris, last’ ‘year’s New York
State champion hurdler, has run

the low hurdles in 19.1 and the‘

high hurdles in 14.0. He is also
ranked as one of the top five
hurdlers in the nation. ‘
Veteran long distance men are
Mike Schurko who is seventh. in

the country in the steeple chase, '

Ken Balkey, Dave Chesebrough,
Dave Szabat, and John Black.

The freshmen recruits in this

category are Bob Schurko,
WPIAL mile champion and bro-

Gymnastics is one of the sports
undergoing a building program
here at Pitt. However. according

to Coach Warren N_eigle. “This

is the third year in a row we are
rebuilding."

'Coach»Neiger takes a squad of
18 menj the‘. big-gest in years,into
and is hoping to
bring home a winner. Neiger has
been coaching Pitt teams for the
last 19 years and has guided the
Panther gymnasts to two ‘NCAA
individual titles, six EIGL titles

and’ 11 EIGL second places. His

1958 Pitt’ team placed seventh in

the nation and was 7-2 overall.

Gymnastics, however. did a
tailspin as did most sports, when
Pitt was in‘ financial trouble in
the" mid-sixties’ and has not been
able to regain its proud stature. 1
, Money to improve the program
is needed to entice the best gym-
nasts from the area to come to
Pitt instead of going to Penn
State and other nearby competi-
tors as they have been doing.
Coach Neiger still has been able
to come up with a strong contin-
gent led by Joe Gracik on the

side horse. ’ n

The gym-men face a 10 meet
schedule opening with Army‘. 2
p.m. Saturday at Trees‘ Gym and
concluding March_1 with Penn
State. -The best gymnasts from
Pitt will go on to Penn State
March 9-11 for the Eastern fin-
als. The most probable candidates
for Easterns from Pitt are Gracik
and senior Mike Matthews.

Tallahassee- For the first quar-
'* ter on Saturday night, it seemed
- as if all the frustrations of the
' past football season at Pitt would
be_compensated_, as the Pan-
 thers were leading Florida
State by a 7-0 score.

_. But the Seminoles came roar-

~ ing back in the second ‘period
with 24 "points and held on for
a 31-13 victory, though the Cats
controlled the ball for most of the
second half.

" The loss ended the season for
‘- the Panthers at a disappointing
~ 3-8 record, while the Seminoles,
8-3, are headed for the inaugur-
al Fiesta Bowl against Arizona
"State December 27 in Phoen-
ix.

Gary Huff, the Seminoles’ su-
perb quarterback who leads the
nation‘ in offense, directed the
FSU rally through the air as he
-employed all of his fine receiv-
ing corps. He threw for three
. TD’s and set up another with a
 long pass.

The Panther coaches attempted
a new strategy to stop the dead-
ly attack. but it worked with
‘ I only limited success. In obvious
passing situations, only three
; Panther linemen rushed, while
, an added linebacker dropped
'- back into pass coverage.

The beefed up secondary en-
. joyed its best moments in the
. V’ first quarter. Bill Adams picked
 ‘off Huff’s first pass and raced
/= 42 yards down the sideline to

2 give Pitt the 7-0 lead.
George Feher interecepted
 Huff again towards the end of
T’ the quarter, but the Cats couldn't
, take advantage and were forced
up to punt. ,
The lead quickly vanished as
 ' ﬁHuff hit flanker Kent Gaydos on

r a 52 yard TD‘ pass on the first
play that FSU had possession in
the second quarter.

“We had a blitz on that play,

but he was able to read it,” com-
mented Pitt Defensive Coach

Coach Carl DePasqua was very
impressed with Huff’s ability;

“He had a great deal of poise and '

Havern then moved the. offense

he combined passes to tight ends

B/ill Shaw recovered. The fumble

was Wilson’s only miscue in an,

otherwise good night for the
sophomore who gained 58 yards
to lead the Panther ball carriers.

Unfortunately, Havern ended

his record-filled career on a dim-
note when he was helped from

Even a dismal 3-8 season mark is bound to have

“ its occassional bright spots. Last week linebacker

Ralph Cindrich and center Bob Kuziel were hon-

"cred for their outstanding performances on the

gridiron this fall. Both players were named to the
UPI All-East squad, with Cindrich further dis-

tinguishing himself by his second—team selection
to the Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA)
All-American squad.

After a sparkling,career at Manlius Prep. Ku-
'_ziel enrolled at Pitt. Bob played behind Pitt’s All-'

' -, East center. Dave Magyar, his sophomore season,
" gaining valuable experience. Possibly the Pan-
thers‘ most consistent performer throughout the’

year, Kuziel was the gridders’ ironman, playing
in 31 consecutive contests wearing the Old Gold
and Blue.

An'A1l-East selection in 1968 as a sophomore.
Cindrich was not really surprised at hi_s being
_named again to the list. 7
“I got a lot of publicity here at Pitt, especial-

ly my first two seasons,” explained Cindrich. “In
addition, I think I had my best games this year

against Army, Notre Dame, and Boston College." '

These opponents always get a lot of press cover-
age.
.“I really never thought I'd be named to a sec-

 ,_ond-team All-American squad. But the choice of

‘Penn State’s Charlie Zapiec to the first-team line-
--backing spot»was- unexpected. It’s just that he re-

‘ Besides Ralph Cindrich and Bob Kuziel, sev-

Cindrich feels that the pro draft will vindicate

their not being honored, partially due to Pitt’s

won-lost mark.

"Our team record certainly hurt us in gaining
more All-East recognition. Guys like Jack Dykes,
Steve Moyer, and Joel Klimek (recently named

Vicious
cycle

by MARTY HELLMAN
Associate Sports Editor

llllllllllllIlllllllllllllIIIIllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllllll:

 

Respectable Pitt football was. what ‘everyone hoped for
after the 3-27 fiasco during Dave Ha-rt’s ’66-’68 tenure.
First respectability, and then solid winning football teams
would hopefully ensue. Everyone realized it would take
time to break the bonds of the vicious cycle ensnaring Pan-
ther football. Yet all hoped it could be achieved — Pitt’s
hallowed _football tradition must be revitalized.

For the first two seasons under Carl DePasqua and his
coaching staff, the Panthers attained the desired respect and
the cycle’s influence declined. ‘

(including myself) to believe this was the fall when respec-
tability might take a back seat to victory. The loop showed
signs of shattering-a path to the turning point was under
construction. '

‘  ‘“‘No‘w‘, eleven weeks later, I feel that-the"cycl*ei1s sit-il'l *inW'

tact, perhapsstronger than ever. Respectability _procured
previously was tarnished in several one-sided defeats and
the trio of victories was unconvincing‘,over the three weak-

est opponents,record-wise, on our schedule.

Yet the biggest disappointment of the campaign must
be the Panthershinability to win though they outplayed the
opponents statistically at least four times(Army, West Vir-
ginia, Florida State, and Boston College).

Undoubtably, a major reason for the dismal season was

‘ the lack of experience in several areas. The coaches relied

on many sophomores to fill positions in the defensive back-

kicking duties.

However, considering the caliber and number of start-
ing seniors, I doubt whether the sophs’ experience plus next
year’s additions will more than ’ compensate for the severe
loss due to graduation. Remember, ten Cats had shots at the
pros last year and over a half-dozen are being considered-
~ presently. Quality was there. . ~ ‘

Improvements and changes for
next season? Hopefully, the offensive
attack will be more varied with Bob
Medwid at quarterback. Pitchouts,
power sweeps, options, and other var-
iations must replace the overworked
‘up the middle’ rushing style so pre-
valent in the Panther attack this year.

_What used .to consist of three
yards and a cloud-of dust is now only
three yards and an Astro-turf burn.

Spirit and enthusiasm. Two words
almost non-existent in the Panther
overall scheme. I understand that the
coaching staff does not emphasize
them in its philosophy. Perhaps their 
institution of these qualities may go DEPASQUA
a long way to aiding the team. Maybe not, but many other
successful teams have both assests on the field and off. _

Another area which may need improvement is the
freshmen training program. Unfortunately, the frosh must
serve as ‘dummies’ for the. varsity as it prepares for the
weekly game. DePasqua doesn’t have the pleasure. of a
large non-varsity -squad like- UCLA, Florida State, and oth-
er earns. ’ .

_ Despite this necessity, more time must be set aside to
indoctrinate the frosh into the rigors of college football,
or more walk—onsmust be encouraged for depth purposes. .

Inexperience and mistakes on the sophomore’s part
were offered constantly as reasons for poor team perfor-

    

' mances this fall. I - _
Yet it seems that inexperience is, a feeble excuse after .

a freshmen program, spring drills, fall camp drills, and
twelve weeks of season preparation have been completed. ‘

Within. the next year or two, DePasqua’s contract pre-
sumably expires and until then, he’ll be under heavy pres-
sure to produce‘ more than just a handful of mediocre vic-
tories like this year.

My optimism about the next several years is a cloud-
ed-I'm no longer certain that the fourth or fifth year of De-
Pasqua’s reign will turn the corner convincingly or even
approach that corner. =

If DePasqua and his staff can’t break '-the Panther
football program out of the vicious cycle, then either the
schedule and program must be deemphasized, or a major
shake-up will be necessary in the Athletic Department.

’It’s absurd to continue playing the.,__,bi_g. bpys while
we re not one ourself. ‘I hope DePasqua and? his staff
prove me wrong by making us more than respectable and

Smokey Yunick had proved itself
throughout the week before the
race by powering the car to sec-
ond place on the starting grid.

The entire team. crew mem-

tator members were loose.

Fryer was telling everyone who
asked him about the car and how
it was performing that he was
"letting up a little so that the
other drivers couldn't see how
good a car he had." And so the
stage was set.

The Pace car, a Triumph. Stage
driven by Mark Donahue, brought

the 15 cars in pairs down the-

hill to the start finish line, with
the Pitt Camaro in the first row
with pole setter Warren Tope,
who held the fastest time in prac-
tice.

‘Everyone floored and down-
shifted their cars for maximum
acceleration the moment the
green flag was dropped. All but
the Pitt Camaro and a Dodge
Challenger got away smoothly
from the start. ‘

The Camaro faltered. The car
dropped from second to fifth place
within a matter of tenths of sec-
onds. The cars went out of sight
around turn number two and be-
came visible once again one min-

ute and 30 seconds later around

turn nine. -

The Camaro was in fourth place,
boxed between two - other Ca-
