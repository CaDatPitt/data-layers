Research at the University of’

Pittsburgh has come a long way
since that day back in 1946 when
a mere $1,900 grant was given for

the entire Medical School research _
program. The money was to be ,

used for the study of high blood
pressure. p

This year, the budget for ‘the
school was over a million dollars,
$1,056,299 was the total research
fund available. ,

The budget is divided among

several different labs, presenting

a diversiﬁed program.
Research Labs

One of the ﬁrst of these labs to
be established was‘ the Renzie-
hausen Laboratory, under the di-
rection of T. S., Danowski, pro-
fessor of research medicine. Dr.
Danowski is studying the meta-
bolic disease ‘of the body, the man-
ner in which the body handles
food stuffs and waste. ,

Soon after the opening of the
Renziehausen Lab, the Virus,,Re-
search Laboratory was’ initiated.

-At its outset, the lab was under

the cooperative direction of Reu-
ben Schlesinger and Max Lauffer,
head of the department of biophy-
sics. During the past ﬁve years
thevirus program here has been
headed by Dr. Jonas E. Salk,‘ di-
-rector of the virus lab.

Polio Vaccine

Most of the world is aware of
the Work being done by Dr. Salk
and his associates. They have de-
veloped a vaccine to combat the
three known types of polio virus.

At‘ approximately the same time
that Dr. Salk became head of the
virus lab, the University acquired
the Western Pennsylvania Psychi-
atric Hospital.

In this hospital much work is
being done by 1. Arthur Mirsky,

 

Million-Dollar Aid V
Used ibyMed School 

neNrNN6

professor of clinical science. His
work involves research on the
mechanism responsible for mental
health and mental‘ illness.
Brain Development

Oneof the long and continued
research programs carried out here
is the work of Davenport Hooker,
professor of anatomy. He is study-
ing the earliest nerve responses‘ of
the infant in an attempt to deter-_
’mine what parts of the brain de-
velopﬁrst.

Of the several research labs, the

- Addisong H. Gibson Laboratory. -is

perhaps one of the best known. It

was ‘established in 1948 to serve.

two functions. First was ‘to pro‘-'
vide animal 3 research’ facilities to
other departments and to carry on
its own research problems in an’.
teriosclerosis (hardening of thearo
teries). Second was to—_provide the
service function of radioisotope lab
facilities for research and patient
care. This function has "now gained
its greatest fame. ‘

The lab is under. the direction of

Campbell Moses.

The sources of the grants, from
which the University made the re-
search budget of over a million
dollars, shows a cross section of
the nation. Approximately 62.4
per cent came from philanthropic
and scientiﬁc donors, 23.4 per cent
came from federal funds, 1.4 per
cent from industry, 1 per cent
from individual sources, 9.5 per

cent from University funds, and~

2.3 per cent from other sources.

 Spring Carnival: has once again taken over Pitt as
"tents cover the campus and the Greeks begin to wonder
‘what eight hours sleep would be like. For the student at

 -Pitt, Carnival may mean Work, lack of sleep, cutting

classes and more work. But when the’ shows are ready to
go and the carnival "grounds are thrown‘ open to the public
.it spells fun for everyone.

Credit must ,be given those who have worked unstint-

T Iingly to make Carnival what it is. Hazell Hallam and her ..
. committee have done a magniﬁcent job of organizing and

creating what may very well be the best.’ show in Pitt’s
history.. Credit must also go to the students who worked

' --through the night last Monday despite falling temperatures

 

and chilling rains. It is°’only through the efforts of these

 students that all may see and enjoy Spring Carnival.

Carnival also spells school spirit although this may ‘not

U - be. immediately evident. It is not created for the. singular

enjoyment of the sororities and fraternities on campus, it
is created for the Pitt student, whether he be a Greek or an
independent commuter. - .

A ‘Unfortunately every year bringsa measure. of vandal-
ism to Carnival. Tents are smashed and petty thievery

By Tim Kovar
At a recent convention of the National As-
sociation of Manufacturers, Harold C. McClellan,
NAM president, made the remark that business
and industry “carry their share of the burden of
education” since education is the responsibility.of

all. He made this statement in reply to a query .

of industrial ﬁnances to education. NAM pub-
lishes a booklet under the title
of “Industry’s .Stake in Educa-
tion” and a direct quote from the
material is “But for too many
years industry and business have
proﬁted from the work of our
ﬁne institutions of higher learn-
ing without signiﬁcant social con-
science as- to the responsibility
thereby incurred for contribu-
tions to their support and fur- ~-
ther growth.” ,
The conﬂicting statements are typical of the
thinking today that surrounds the problem of in-

dustrial aid, both moral and ﬁnancial, to col-.

leges.

At present, the University of Pittsburgh receives
approximately 22% per cent of its income from
foundations, companies, the treasurer of the United
States and other sources for the purpose of re-
search and development. The University spends
77 per cent or $7,312,148 of its income yearly on
instruction and research. The University also oper-

ates at aloss of approximately $165,238 per year.-

Obviously this cannot go on forever but the money
must come from somewhere and just as obviously,
the source must be industry and business.

‘Aid to Culture ' —

Most of the industrial aid to universities 'con-
sists of research and development grants for spe-
ciﬁc projects. What is needed now is support for
the cultural fundamentals, the well—educated stu-
dent with broad, general knowledge, jtheageneral
college courses rather than speciﬁc sciences and
technical phases. With the importance of a rapidly
developing world that is at the» same time becom-
ing a closer more compact and integrated unit, we
must train and educate our people to cope with

society as a whole rather than teach them ‘in a T

vacuum that renders.them helpless when removed
from their element or exposed to the social, eco-
nomical, and political activities of our body politic.

A preliminary report from the Indust_ry-Col-

‘ lege Conference held last Fall in West Virginia

emphasizes these points and,’ lays particular stress
on the positions in industry that require -top-flight,
well—versed executives to take over the.‘ highest
positions in the management of our business, edu-
cational, and political institutions. The conference
concluded that cooperation must bedeveloped be-
twee'n industry and education and suggested meth-
ods to achieve this end; wider use of '-scholarship
programs, wor_k—study plans, guidance services,’ on-
the-joab-training, short courses, seminars and con-
ferences, exchange of personnel with college pro-
fessors working for industry’ and’ industrial’ per-
sonnel serving as temporary faculty members, re-
search projects, and direct gifts to college or groups
of college. . '
Mpre Cooperation ’. - 

The conference also reached the conclusion that_
colleges should gear more of their educational
courses to industry’s direct and immediate needs

and industry should, at the same time, contribute .

more freely and fully to the general needs ‘of
educational institutions. That industry should

  

 Industry, Higher Education

realize their obligation to colleges for the liberal‘
arts student is indicated by the employment rate:
of a large manufacturing concern. Last year, Gen-
eral Motors hired some 2000 college graduates to
ﬁll positions in their organization. Of this total,
900 were specialists in one ﬁeld orianother ‘while
the remaining 1100 were generally educated, liberal,
arts graduates.

Business and industry have the means to sup-.
port the colleges, if only through the system of be-
ing able to deduct up to 5 per cent of their taxable
proﬁts for education purposes. In addition, they
could assist ﬁnancially, not by Carnegie—like grants,
but with smaller amounts at regular intervals
that would assure a continuing supply of ﬁnances
on a small scale but provide income that would as-
sume grand proportions if followed as a general
policy by a majority of the companies capable of ‘
extending aidto their source of personnel supply.
Perhaps the Beginning , — a

When the Mellon Foundations recently granted
the University Health services the magniﬁcent sum
of $15,000,000 for the purpose of establishing .a
fund for salaries for the "instructor corpsyof the

graduate schools, they indicated their realization '

of the need for support andimprovement’ of, the
position of the people who are teaching in the in-
stitutions as well as assistance givento the im-'
provement of physical properties. They have paved
the way and set anexample for industrial concerns

 

I

to ﬁnd their depository for donations and the log_i- _ 

cal place‘. is in the undergraduate schools where
the basic fundamentals, the all-around education,
and the specialized training are disseminated to the
people who will eventually be moving into busi-
ness. It’s a form of insurance thattpays oﬁ regu-

larly as graduation‘ and not because of accident"

and negative or adverse circumstances.

It is time, also, for these people, ‘who are con- ‘I

tributing :to the educational institutions or who’
should contribute, to realize that the quality of

4 education’ depends upon the ability of the teacher

and the quality of the material being taught.
Aid Where,N"eeded 2
And to insure the best instructor staff for stui
dents,-we must provide for the recognition of quali-
ty teachers by providing the same ﬁnancial rewards
for educational ability that are available to the‘
better people in industry. Teaching for, the sake
of
idealistic, but the necessities of. life and the sup-’
-port of a family require ﬁnances that are at present '

not available in sufﬁcient quantities to make teach- _"’

ing the attractive and respected position it should ’

‘occupy. The clean or professor in college should V

have the stature and wherewithal to _rival_ his

counterpart in industry instead of regarding him _
with envy. He should not be forced to” choose ,

between the position that will enable .him to live

comfortably but offer less satisfaction and the edu- O
cational opportunity that is satisfying but not ﬁnan- T
cially suitable to" make ends meet without sacri- -’

~ﬁce.

.This’*is not‘ to say that educators are in rags,
living in’ disreputable hpvels and just barely stavl V
ing off the wolf at the door, but they are in need
of higher salaries and beneﬁts. If business and..i_n-

dustry want to “carry their share” and obtain the _

best in.°educated manpower, they must help pro-
vide for the teaching of their future employers’
and employees with the ﬁnancial "aid they have
available. They and the educators must cooperate
t9 understand the problems of the other and. con- ‘
tribute to their own success and the welfare of
each other.

Within" the next three days,
Pitt’s infamous title, “Streetcar
School” may be a misnomer.‘ If
the union and PRR oﬁicials are

. unable to conciliate before the
Friday midnight deadline, Anne
X. Alpern may have her wish
that streetcars be .run off the
Pittsburgh streets. Unfortunately

busses will no longer be running ’

to compensate. And Pitt students
who ﬁnd themselves on the de-
fensive concerning our daily
transportation can grin offensive-
ly and say, “No streetcars. That
name is as past as ‘smoke’.”

At the same time, some little

bit might be done to eliminate
the impersonal tag which has
been glued to the University.

Few drivers will be choosy
when they drive past students
carrying the yellow lifesavers . . .
especially if they too bear the
card on the windshield. And no
streetcar or bus patron will be
particularly particular when he’s
offered .a ride.

On thecontrary, a_,spirit of co-

‘ V ‘E1157-

operation has already permeated I

 

students’ minds and, without a
doubt, the end result will be an
all-around improved friendly at-
titude.

But over this slight ray of sun-
shine is the black thundercloud-—
parking. Where? SC hasn’t yet
persuaded city fathers to remove
Schenley Plaza and neither has
work begun on the parking lot
under Soldiers’ and Sailors’ Me-
moral. Parking lot oﬁicials, be-
ing. practical businessmen, will
probably jack up prices. And if
PRR statistics, twelve streetcars
equal ﬁve hundred cars, are cor-
rect, we can expect all hell to
break loose in Oakland as far as
parking is concerned.

Yet the absence of streetcars
might provide another parking
spot. The streetcar tracks.
Though not many, cars could be

‘parked two or three abreast

across the tracks, with ’ enough
room remaining for regular traffic
circulation. ‘

Citing a loss of .‘two million
assengersx in 1953, Palmer has
stated that in the event of wage

 increases, fares "would be 3 raised‘

./ 

 

again. Pitt students would ‘-be
sharply hit by another increase.-
However, a suggestion -‘from,
this commuter—special rates be
given Pitt students in a similar
manner to thosegiven high school
pupils. Special fares would en-
courage more- student riders, not
only during the day,‘ riders would‘;
more readily return to the uni-_
versity for evening meetings and
programs if streetcar fares
weren’t so prohibitive. Special

‘rates will be beneﬁcial by at-
tracting more students to travel "

back and forth in the red and
white tin cans of Pittsburgh” Rail-
ways. Now, men- and women
here are closely eyeing their bank
books so prominently covered
with red ink‘. ~

Certainly if fares increase
along with wage raises, the name
“Streetcar School” will be less
than a truth.

Whatever the outcome of the
labor-management meetings, it
vitally» concerns Pitt. students in

addition to our fellow. victimsjaj

Wallace Heads Slavonic Study

By NANCY SCHOR

William Wallace, lecturer and
research assistant in the History
Department, was born in Scotland,
du_cated in Glasgow and London,
=and.is now studying the back-

grounds of Western Pennsylvania-
. citizens from Poland, Czechoslova-

kia, and Yugoslovia. "

Besides that, he spent time in
Malaya ‘and Borneo while in the
British Navy, and a summer
studying in Czechoslovakia and
Yugoslovakia. This is quite an in-
ternational combination, even for
.the University of Pittsburgh.

Slavonic Research

History students have little op-
portunity to get to know Wallace,
although he occasionally lectures
to European history classes study-
ing Central Europe. He has been
at Pitt since October, 1953, to
launch research on the University

" project, ‘studying -the immigration. ‘

of Slavonic peoples into Western
Pennsylvania during the last cen-
tury.
a “Do you know who the Sla-
vonic peoples are?” he asks. “It is
_'as easy for anyone to confuse the
namesof Central Eu\ropean peo-
ples‘ ‘as it was for‘ me unravel all
your forty-eight states.
“Slavonic” differs from “Slo-
venian and Slavonian” because
they are names of small Yugoslov-
_ian “groups while “Slavonic” de-
scribes an entire race inhabiting
Poland, Czechoslavokia, Y u g o -

, slavia, Bulgaria and Russia.

Contributors to Coal and Steel
Wallace is interested mainly in
the Poles, Czechoslovaks and Yu-

. goslavs because they have done

much to inﬂuence Western Penn-
sylvania history through their
contributions to the steel and coal
industries and the part they play-
ed in reshaping Central Europe
after World War I. ’

His Work started when the His-
tory Department decided to con-
tinue its survey of Western Penn-
sylvania history‘ from 1850 to the
present time. V

The department feels that be-

 sides adding ,to the survey be-

cause of the constant inﬂux of
Slavonic peoples, the study will
bring long-overdue recognition to
the Slavoniv, culture and create

Lead Offensive Attack 

By STEVE BUTCHOCK
The bpoming bats of Pitt’s power men have provided
baseball coach Ralph “Sarge”'Mitterling with a 5-3 record

through the ﬁrst eight games, just a reverse of the three
and ﬁve slate they held at this¢

stage of the season last year.
The most notable addition to the

offensive attack has been ﬁrst

baseman Dick Deitrick, who has a

current batting average of .355
and theleadership in RBI’s with
seven. He is alsotied for the most
number of hits with Bob Kyle
and Milt, Emery at eleven.

Kyle and,Emery are two more
of the Mittmen who are having
a. banner season so far. Kyle
has steadily raised‘ his average
to the present .321, which is
about on a par with his perform-
ance of a season ago. Emery,‘

I who had an anemic .194 at this
time last year, is the top hit-
ter with a robust -.379 average.

The biggest disappointments to
date have been center ﬁelder Har-
ry Little and third baseman Dick
Lepkowski. Little, who got off to
a very fast start last year with
seven "hits in his ﬁrst 20 trips to
the plate, has been able to collect
only ,two safeties in 28 appearances.
at the platter foran unhealthy .071
average.

Lepkowski, who was hitting a
respectable .281 at this time a
year ago; also has been experienc-
ing difﬁculty "in “hitting them
where they ain’t.” His two for

13 has demoted him to the bench,

for a rest in favor of Frank Hun-
ter.

First Track WinComesEasily

By GENE AROMATORIO

Fresh from their ﬁrst dual meet Victory of the season,
the Panther thinclads, under Acting Coach Lloyd Duff, are
busy prepping for their upcoming meet with Penn State
this Saturday. ..

Last Saturday the Panthers were red hot as they mauled
a badly outclassed and undermanned West Virginia team
by the lopsided score of 111-l9—a record margin for the
47-year-old series. 6

Three Double Winners

a full second off the previous mark

in th_e art of winning.

Although Pitt has not reached
the top yet, some schools have
already expressed a notion that
they do not want to meet the
Panthers on the football ﬁeld any-
more. " One can be positive Pitt
is not frightened, for when the
Panthers had little chance of win-
ning, they always played the best
in the country. -The schedule al-
ways included a few Big Ten
teams and Notre Dame. When
Pitt decided to de-‘emphasize foot-

— ball. in the lateathirties, somebody

forgot to do the same to the sched-
ule. \
Now whenthe time is near that

-Pitt will be able to repay certain

teams" for those 50'-0 beatings,.the
athletic department is ﬁnding it
hard to schedule games.

_ Strained Relations

Notre Dame, a team which Pitt
has beaten only once since 1937,
is off the schedule after this fall.
Although the Irish lead Pitt, 14-6,
in the all-time series, the Pan-

thers managed to break even in-

the ﬁrst ten, games. In fact, Pitt
not only licked the Irish three
straight years but held them score-
less at the same time. In 1935,
Pitt lost to ND but won the next

cause Elmer Layden, Notre Dame
coach,“ and the late Dr. Jock
Sutherland could not see eye-to-
eye on certain matters. This feud

began when Layden was coach at-

Duquesne. However, it was Notre
Dame which broke-off relations.
Now here we are again. Pitt has

an oportunity to settle. a few scores-

with Notre Dame. One story says
Notre Dame was very unhappy
over the way the Pitt athletic de-

partment handled the Joe Schmidt,

incident. If you recall, Schmidt
had to leave the _Pitt-Notre Dame
game twoyears ago because of a
head injuryreceived in the sec-
ond half. Many Pitt rooters feel
that Notre Dame deliberately tried
to get Schmidt out of the game.
Here is where the trouble between
the two schools began. .
Loser Is Popular

But the fact still remains that
Pitt wants to play Notre Dame, but
the Irish want no part of the Pan-
thers.

,If Pitt managestto beat‘Notre
Dame next fall, the problem of
getting Notre Dame to return to
schedule for one more game would
"be easy since the Irish would not
want to conclude. the series with
a loss like in 1937. This would
leave, them open for criticism
again. I imagine the only other
way would be for Pitt to start los-
ing every game again. Then Pitt
would have no schedule problems.

Everybody loves to play. a loser.

Duff, who had ﬁgured out the

' timetable, explained his prediction

by saying, “Arnie knows his pace
and we ﬁgured out what he had to
run in each quarter in order to

 break the record. He was right on
 the button at the end-of the ﬁrst

quarter and then he went all-out
on the last one.” '

Sowell ran the. ﬁrst quarter in

, leading all the way.

Students To Exeavate Camp, 

The University of Pittsburgh has¢—-————

announced that Dr. William E. Ed-
wards of the sociology department,
will lead an eight-week expedition
this July and August in which the
students who accompany him will
with suitable arrangement, receive
college credits. .

Purpose of this expedition will
be to discover
campsites of the earliest inhabi-
tants of North America, primitive
migratory hunters who entered
America by a land bridge from
Siberia more than 10,000 years ago.

Associated with the spear
points, d r i 1 l s, skin-scrapers,
choppers, and other implements‘
of these Early Hunters, Dr. Ed-
wards also hopes to ﬁnd abund-
ant skeletal remains of the big
game which provided their food
-—mammoth, mastodon, saber-
toothed tiger, giant ground sloth,
camel, horse, giant armadillo,
tapir, and others.

Since very little is'known of
these Early Hunters east of the
Great Plains, this expedition
should produce evidence of great
importance. " Another
purpose of the expedition will be
to teach interested students the
proper techniques of locating and
excavating campsites and villages,
of primitive man as well as some-
thing about the civilizations of
these “ﬁrst Americans.”

a n d excavate,

Dr. ‘Edwards, who earned his
Ph.D. at Columbia University,
came to Pitt last September as
assistant professor of anthropol-
ogy in the department of soci-
ology after teaching at Hunter
College in New York. He has
conducted and directed eight
seasons of archaeological ﬁeld
research in the Southeast, Mary-
land, the Southwest, and Eu-
rope.

Precise localities to which the
group will go have not yet been
decided, but students may expect
to travel some 1000 miles from

Pittsburgh.
Undergraduate, and graduate

students may participate during,
either July (5th to 31st) or August 7

(2nd to 28th) or both, with four
credits in the department of soci-
ology for one month, or eight cred-'
its for the full eight weeks. \En-
rollment will this summer be lim-
ited to male students receiving the
instructor’s approval. A
