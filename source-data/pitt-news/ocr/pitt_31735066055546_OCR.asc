The 3800 block of Fifth Avenue, shown here, will soon be torn down in order to build
a park, for now, and student housing eventually.

BK site In become park

By Joe Wright

News Editor

Fifth Avenue between Bouquet Street and

Oakland Avenue looks like a poster of urban 2

decay. But Pitt has a plan in the works to
make it a shining example of urban renewal.

On‘Jan. 10, the Pittsburgh city -Planning
Commission granted Pitt permission to
demolish the buildings on that property and
build a small park on the site.

The block currently contains three build-
ings formerly occupied by local businesses
— Burger King, the Pitt ‘Tavern and Your
Campus Store. All three businesses have
been closed for at least three years, and Pitt
has owned the property for over a year.

The Master Space Plan, Pitt’s long-term
plan for growth and development, calls for
the "university to build student housing on
that property. However, according to Pitt
spokesperson Ken Service, “The dorm is
probably several years away.”

The park was proposed. because “the
buildings on the property are unsightly and
becoming unsafe,” according to Service. "

Director of Local Relations Jay'Roling
said building the park would be preferable to
leaving the property empty. If left empty, the

property would remain unsightly, as the
backs of the buildings on Forbes Avenue
would be exposed, Roling said. .

Demolishing the existing buildings will .

cost approximately $250,000, according to
Service. This cost. would be accrued eventu-
ally anyway in order to build the residence

The park will contain grass, trees, benches

and additional" lighting. The cost of building

the park will be approximately $30,000,
according to Service, who said the trees,

A lights. and benches will all be “relocatable”

when the residence hall is built.

Although the Master Space Plan had
already been approved by the city Planning
Commission, further approval was needed to
demolish the buildings, because the city
must approve any demolition of buildings.

Roling, who presented the idea for the
park to the commission, said Pitt is building
the park because “in the interim, the univer-
sity wanted to be a good neighbor.”

One of the main goals of the master space
plan project is more_ housing for students, a
problem Pitt officials have been looking into
for years. The Master Space Plan includes
the addition of approximately’ 1,000 beds
over the next ten years. i . t

BiGALA
faces
harassment  

By Mark Gordon and
Anthony Breznican
The Pitt News

' “Flaming faggots should be used

for military experimentations.”
“Disband your group by means
of mass suicide.”

Those are the contents of two

notes that were recently placed in
the BiGALA mailbox in its ‘fifth-
ﬂoor William Pitt Union cubicle.
That is one of the incidents that

have led the student group for .

bisexuals and gays to file harass-
ment charges with Pitt Police and
the university’s affirmative action
office.

BiGALA member Katie
Douglass said those notes were not
the first instance of harassment.

“In November, we were sitting
down for a meeting when two

male voices from the side started’

yelling, ‘Faggots, faggots,”
Douglass said.

Some members followed the twc
people, but they ran away down 2
ﬂight of stairs.

Pitt Police Chief Rick Boyd said
he takes reports of harassment
against BiGALA or any other stu-
dent group very seriously.

“We will attempt tolmore closely
monitor the vulnerability of
BiGALA in the hopes that these
foolish people will repeat

themselves and get caught,” Boyd .

said. »

Douglass said some BiGAL
members have also received
harassing messages on telephone
answering machines, and the
group’s ﬂiers sometimes get ripped
down from poles throughout cam-
pus. '

Last night was BiGALA’s first
meeting of the semester. Douglass
said the group is open to anybody
on campus, whether straight or

Law instructor fights health c

By Jennifer Alpha
Staff Writer A

The University of
Pittsburgh has sparked a new
controversy in the health care
debate. . ’

Deborah M. Henson, a
legal writing instructor at the
School of Law, has accused
the university of discrimina-
tion because it refuses to pro-
vide health care benefits to
her lesbian partner of nine

» years.

Henson, who began chal-

lenging the university to
§c.l_1ange its policies two weeks
after-she was hired in July
_; 1994, took a legal step by fil-

ing a complaint with the
Pittsburgh Human ‘Relations
Commission on Jan. 5. She
said Pitt is violating a city
ordinance banning discrimi-
nation based on sexual orien-

tation.
Henson claims that “virtu-
ally - all” heterosexual

employees at Pitt ‘receive
health care benefits for their
spouses because of
Pennsylvania’s loose laws on
common law marriage and
Pitt’s lax practices in requir-
ing documentation of mar-
riage by its employees.»
Henson explains that if a
heterosexual employee and a
homosexual employee each

want to extend health care

_ coverage to their spouses, the

heterosexual employee can

simply claim marital status

with little scrutiny. _
The benefits provided to

' same-sex domestic partners

are free tuition credits,
bereavement benefits and
university ,identification
cards. Employees must first
complete a notarized affi-

ldavit documenting that the

couple have lived in a cohab-
itational, financially interde-
pendent, mutually caring
relationship for at least two
years, said Ken Service,
spokesperson . for the
University of Pittsburgh.

are policy

Though the university

refuses health care benefits ‘
to both same- and opposite- »

sex domestic. partners, there
is a disproportionate impact
on employees with same-sex
domestic partners because
they do not have the option
to marry in the state of
Pennsylvania.

The university, Henson

said, has the opportunity to

define who is covered by
health benefits and therefore
can change this policy, based
on marital status, which dis-
criminates disproportionately
against homosexuals.

Method to Pil1's madness
when cancelling classes

By Steve Westrick
Staff Writer

It was supposed to be the
third day of classes. But when
students awoke from their
sleep. they found that 15 inch-
es of snow had fallen on the
campus.

In a sudden jolt of excite-
ment and wonder, many stu-
dents called Telefact to find
that all classes had been can-
celled for the day.

All classes for Monday, Jan.

8. were officially canceled I

around 9:45 the evening of the
previous day, Jan. 7.

The last time all classes
were cancelled due to weather

' was two years ago when then-

Gov. Casey declared a state of
emergency because the weath-
er had dropped to negative 20
degrees. '

Pitt spokesperson Ken
Service said the final decision

' on class cancellations is

always made by the chancel-
lor.

“[The chancellor] receives
input from people who know
about the situation. But the
final decision is his,” he said.

One place this input comes
from is the Pitt Police depart-
ment, which is constantly in
contact with the highway

patrols so that it knows which"

roads are open and which are
closed, said John DeVitto,
associate vice chancellor of
business.

The decision coming out of
the chancellor’s office was that
all classes would be cancelled
but the university would
remain open.

DeVitto is responsible for
informing the campus police
department, transportation,
food services and other univer-
sity departments of the chan-
cellor’s decision and said peo-
ple cannot expect th”é’"u'niversi-
ty to close, because many of
those employees of the univer-
sity are essential to the welfare
of students.

“Roughly 5,000 students
live on campus, and another 5-
10,000 live in walking dis-
tance of campus. We still need
to feed and take care of these
students,” he said. “You try to
keep as many people home as
you can, and the ones that are_
essential come in to operate
the school.”

DeVitto said there is no set
criteria when making a deci-
sion about class cancelation.
“Every time is an independent
event. You look at the weather,
what time of day it is, are the
buses running, is the turnpike
clear. All these things are
taken in to consideration.”

Student Government involved in a variety of activities

By Danielle Shuster
Staff Writer

Any students who called
Telefact last Sunday to find out
if classes were cancelled,
glanced up at the clock on the
William Pitt Union lawn to see
if they were late for class, or
gave directions to Pitt by point-
ing out the banners declaring
the university’s name have
directly benefited from the
Student Government Board.

Despite these accomplish-
ments, many students feel that
the SGB has never done any-
thing that directly benefited
them.

“I’ve never seen anything
good come out of the SGB.
None of the problems people
complain about are ever ﬁxed,”
said Tara Thomas, a junior who
has never voted in an SGB elec-

_tion. “A large number of stu-

dents complain that there is
nowhere to smoke in the dorms.
If [SGB] really wanted to do
something, they would work on
making smoking lounges in the
donns. That’s something that is
a real problem on campus.”

In turn, members of the SGB
feel that the student body is
uninformed of their accom-
plishments.

“A lot of the problem with
the relationship between the
student body and the SGB is

affected by The Pitt News pre- A

senting the SGB as ‘good old
boy puppets’ to the administra-
tion and the students,” said John

Callahan, 1995 board member 0

and 1995 presidential election
candidate. “If they reported on
projects and the role we play
more objectively instead of
making uninformed specula-
tions and hypotheses, we’d be
better able to represent the stu-
dent body.” ' ‘

One factor often overlooked
is that changes don’t happen
overnight. It often takes years
for an idea to come to life.

During Ross Pasquale’s presi-

' dency, he succeeded in raising

the student activity fee from
$32 to $40.
“Many may not have seen the

' raiseas good thing,” said

Pasquale, “but without it, ser-
vices such as Telefact and Pitt
Program Council would_haVe
been cut.”

Telefact is a call-in informa-
tion service that answers about
550 calls a day. It’s useful to
students because it answers a
variety of questions ranging

to the committee. If the answer
is yes, the idea is then put to the
University Planning and Budget
Systems. The UPBS then votes.
Even if it allows the idea, it
may not send the money imme-
diately.

Unfortunately, while the SGB
was cutting through two years’
worth of red tape, there were
seven reported rapes and 46
reported aggravated assaults on
campus from 1992 to 1994. It
should not be assumed that all
of these crimes were the result
of walking home alone at night,
but at least one may have been
averted if there had been an

Over the summer, blue and

The altar of athletics

If you’ve been conscious any time in the past week, you know
that the Black & Gold, the home-town Stillers, are going to the
Super Bowl. And if you ever turn on the radio during the after-
noon, watch the local news or even glance at the front page of a
newspaper, you might have an idea of the craze that took over
Pittsburgh before the Indianapolis Colts even ever came to the

* ‘Burgh.

Loyal fans stood in the cold at Market Square last week for a
pre-game rally, running down to the festivities on their lunch hours.
Other die-hards showed up at Three Rivers Stadium at 3:30 a.m.
Sunday to get a good tailgate spot. When the game was over and
Pittsburgh booked a ﬂight to Arizona, the whole city erupted.

It’s great that Pittsburgh is going to the Super Bowl, but lately
sports seem to have taken on a divine appearance. Judging from
the price of a ﬂight to Arizona next weekend, you would think
Zeus vs. Christ was the main event. A roundtrip ﬂight over Super
Bowl weekend between Pittsburgh and Phoenix is running some-
where around $1000. That doesn’t even include a hotel, meals or a
ticket to the game. But, hey, it’s the Super Bowl, right? Americans
live and die for their football teams, and if people are willing to pay
it, airlines can charge as much as they want to. '

Super Bowl Madness has gone farther than outrageous ticket '
prices, though. The day of the Dallas/Green Bay game, one Dallas
supermarket declared it Cowboys day. Employees were allowed to
wear either Dallas Cowboys shirts or their employee uniforms.
One of the employees didn’t own a Cowboys jersey (he was a
Washington Redskins fan) but didn’t want to be the only one wear-

: ing a store uniform. He bought a Green Bay jersey, wore it to work

and was ﬁred. Do we need to add “preference of sports teams” to
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission guidelines?

But it’s not just the Super Bowl that causes this kind of craze.
Hotels in Atlanta have been booked solid for July and August 1996
since early last year. People in and around Atlanta are renting out
rooms in their own houses for up to $1000 during the Olympics.
Others who have rented apartments in the Atlanta area for years are
being told they will not be allowed to renew their leases once they
expire in June; that way landlords can offer short-term _leases at
outrageous pricesduring the Olympics. Tickets for the games have
been sold out for months, even though the most popular sports sold
at around $400 a seat per day. Even the Opening Ceremony sold
out. You may still be able to get tickets for the Bolivia/Ukraine
round one basketball game, but you’ll have to shell out a hell of a
lot of money to stay in Atlanta the night before the game.

It’s amazing -how far people are willing to go in order to worship
at the altar of their favorite sports personality. Maybe we should all
take a lesson from Charles Barkley, who claimed that he was an
asshole, not a hero. Sports are exciting: They are fun to play or
watch, but they are hardly worth dropping our lives and our sav-
ings accounts to go to a game that we can watch on TV for noth-
ing.

IT.

Over the past week, I have
been carefully planning some
choice words for an article
about environmentalists.
Unfortunately, the global
warming we have been experi-
encing last week gave me heat
stroke, so you will have to for-
give me if this article is not up
to my usual standards. For the
purposes of this article, I dis-

7 tinguish between the two

groups of erroneous environ-
mental concerns. _

First, there are the ideas
which are wrong but are diffi-
cult to disprove completely.
These are mainly worries
about the future, such as think-
ing that after a certain number
of years we will all burn up,
freeze or be overrun by people
like me. Such concerns are
very fashionable to people
who believe that the universe
arose on a whim and could
thus end on a whim. If, how-
ever, you correctly believe that
the universe was created, then
these ideas are a waste of
stress. The second group of
concerns are thoughts that are
more tangible, such as over-
population and the destruction
of “ecosystems.”

The belief that this world is
overpopulated, or the fear that
it soon will be, is the most
hideous idea that I can imag-
ine. Social scholars attempt to
blame overpopulation for
many of society’s evils. I fail
to see the connection. Japan,
Belgium, Singapore and
Germany have managed to
thrive despite their perceived
overcrowding. Other countries,
such as Brazil and Russia are
relatively sparse, yet poor. So
then what factors cause nations
to struggle? Socialism and the
lack of a stable, effective gov-
ernment are the two biggest
causes of misery throughout
the world. It’s a good thing we
aren’t letting that happen to
our country.

Not only is overpopulation
not a serious problem, but it

 

Matt
Mills

simply does not exist on a
worldwide level. If the earth’s
land, excluding Antarctica,
were to someday be inhabited
by 14 billion people, it would
be roughly as dense as
Pennsylvania. And anyone
who thinks that the United
States is overpopulated needs
to sit in the window seat of an
airplane and look down.

This brings us to concerns
about things such as preserv-
ing tropical rainforests (in
other words, jungles) and pro-
tecting our ecosystems (what-
ever they are). Some people
claim that we have plundered
our environment for the sake
of industry and commercial
gain. This is really not the
case.

For instance, despite our
emergence as the dominant
economic power in the world,
the U. S. has more trees now
than in 1920. Our material
wealth has given us the time
and ability to preserve and
protect our environment. It is
no coincidence that former
Soviet-bloc countries are now
heavily polluted and in a state
of ecological ruin. Many peo-
ple go so far as to say: that we
would be better off in a more
primitive society, thus allow-
ing nature to be more natural. 1
would like to take this oppor-
tunity to invite all of those
people to go live in the jungles
of Peru and hug trees. Be sure
to pack some insect repellant.

Finally, I need to address
some of our more realistic

environmental concerns and
how we should deal with
them. I first need to establish

"that despite what I have

already written, I am interested
in having a clean, safe envi-
ronment. Pollution is probably
our most important environ-
mental problem. Strict laws,
coupled with genuine effort
by Americans can make the
U.S. a more beautiful country.
Reasonable laws are also nec-
essary to insure that we have

things such as safe water, -

clean air, etc.

However, please do not
believe that simply throwing
excessive regulations at these
problems is the answer. The
environment is yet another
area where Democrats attempt
to smear Republicans in an

effort to be seen as big-heart-_

ed. Let me share a few exam-
ples of ridiculous regulations
which Democrats will have
you to believe are necessary.

A couple in New York was
charged for having a deck
which cast a shadow on a wet-
land. Anchorage, Alaska was
forced to pollute its waste with
fish guts and then treat the
organic material in order to
comply with federal regula-
tions. So the next time you
hear Bill Clinton say that
Republicans want you to drink
dirty water, listen to see if he
can give any proof. I-think we
can all sleep well knowing that
our Republicans are not trying
to destroy our clean water or
pollute our country.

We have seen that the best
way to protect our environ-
ment is to identify actual prob-
lems and act reasonably upon
them. In general, the best way
to combine material success
with a healthy environment is
capitalism and less govern-
ment. If we all earn enough
money, then we can all have
time to pick up trash, plant
trees and save spotted owls.
Matt Mills wishes that Al Gore
would read this article.

 .   L  

I remember a time when the
Oakland Beehive had some
killer shows. The year was
1992, I had just arrived in
Pittsburgh hopelessly con-
fused. Upon my search for
entertainment, I wandered up
to Ice Nine, dropped a load of
cash on ‘zines and passed the
illustrious Beehive
Coffeehouse. Later that night
the. Jesus Lizard, Tar and Don
Cabeliero rocked the house. it
was probably thelast “big”
show the Beehive hosted. Oh
well. _

Almost four years later, I find
the Beehive, uh, buzzin’ again.
From what I hear, Manny’s
planning to book-a show a
month at this swank Pittsburgh

. coffee joint. This is a welcome

change for almost nonexistent

Sonvoﬂ
Trace
Warner Bros.

Trace, the inaugural effort
from Sonvolt, is an album that
sounds as if it were done by a
band that has been around for

years. The quality of the mater- _

ial, lyrically and musically, is so
high that one might think that
Sonvolt is trying to pull a fast
one on us.

Well, they are not pulling a
fast one, but they have, in .a
sense, been around for years.
Sonvolt is fronted by
guitarist/singer/songwriter Jay

- Farrar, veteran of the under-

ground alterna-folk band Uncle
Tupelo. Tupelo broke up a few
years back, which resulted in
the formation of two amazing
bands that both recently
released stellar first albums.

shows. God bless ‘em all,
each and every one of them.
l’ve seen some killer shows at
Lawrence and Doherty, but
maybe some variety will do the
scene good. To kick things off,
Manny has whipped up a local
powerhouse lineup that has
something for everybody:
Hurl, Swob and Shale. To top
it off, two of these acts‘are cel-
ebrating record releases!

Hurl has been pretty active
as of late. My Pal God, a label
from Chicago, released the
group’s third single “Madison
Earfull/Dual Showman,” and
the group hit_ the road touring
the Midwest and the East.
Whew! Then came Bessemer
Process, a double 7" set ‘on
Peas Cor, complete with a

 

one and Wi_lco, headed by

Farrar’s Uncle Tupelo song- 
Jeff ;
Tweedy, is the other. The 
bands share Uncle Tupelo’s 
folk-tinged rock sensibilities 
and stripped-down sound. Both 
also feature former Uncle?

writing counterpart,

Tupelo members in their line-
‘ups. On Trace, former mem-

bers of Uncle Tupelo and cur- 
rent members of Wilco (some '
are one and the same) go to f’

bat for Farrar andvhis band on

their journey through a new 
exploration of the folk rock ::

genre.

Trace is an amazing testa- 
ment to Farrar’s songwriting, 

recordrelease party, no less.
These singles, in particular,
showcase the band’s musical
prowess and growing song-
-writing talent; they are far from
a Slint or Bitch Magnet knock-
off. Their sound not only draws
from these influences, but is
not afraid to bring pop into the
mix. Pop? While a far cry from
a Teenbeat project, Hurl gives
you a lot of melody, not just
dynamic changes and repeat-
ing riffs. The same can be said
of Polvo and it mightmake
more sense, but Hurl has an
undeniable knack for creating
dense melodic guitar rock
(thanks -to Dan ant Mat).
Couple this with Noah’s star-
tling drumming and Matt J’s
understated vocals and you’ve
got a winner! The band had

raspy, soulful voice and intro-  

spective vision). The album 
mellow ~?

opens with _the
“Windfall.” it is the first of many

tunes that showcase the multi- S °

 

recorded an album ages ago.
Frequently known as the “Lost
Record,” it is finally coming out
— very soon. Look for it in
stores in the near future; it’s
entitled A Place Ca//ed Today
and will be out on My Pal God
(vinyl) and Third Gear (CD).
They’re great on record, but
you’ve got to see them live.
Swob, too, has" been very

busy. With the new lineup,

Thad, Steve, Jon and Tod

- have opened up for such acts

as James Chance andthe
Contortions, God is My Co-
Pilot and Rhythm Activism in

local venues throughout the _

city. With a sound that is

somewhere between The Dog"

Faced Hermans, Sonic Youth,
Rapeman and any No-Wave
band of your fancy, Swob has
been pushing their four-man
approach to the limits. Always
experimenting, this lineup has
recorded and pressed a single
on Pop Bus (the label that
spawned their . recording
career) entitled “Word Bit
Wave”. This single is chock-full
of percussive riffs, chaotic
meanderings and full-fledged,
four-on-the-floor rock stomps!
Steve sings and rants like a

man possessed by god-

knows-what and, if I’m not mis-
taken, his new toy, a guitar-
shaped synth thang, was pre-
viously owned by a member of

~ the Silver Bullet Band! I could

be wrong on the details, but
there’s this funky sound that

colors much of the single. And
to top it off, the group is tour-
ing with Thela, an NZ act on
Ecstatic Peace, and Thurston
Moore’s solo project. Their
tour starts Feb 5 and lasts
through the 15th.

Rounding out the show is.

Shale. Pop Bus is glad to be
releasing their debut 7” single
“Shorn/Tollcutter.” The
youngest bandon the roster

has been showcasing their .

chops with the likes of
Unsane, Labradford and Thee
Speaking Canaries this last
year. Not shabby! The only
undeniable instrumental band

of the three, Shale pride them- '

selves for precise time shifts

and stark dynamic changes,

Their music is complex but
with apunk rock sensibility
whereas Don Cabeliero,
who’ve operated with a similar

lineup, might appear more -

“jazzy”. I don’t like to rely on
comparisons or generaliza-
tions. Sure Shale are influ-
enced by Breadwinner, but
they are not a cover band.
Their songs are heavy and
energetic and worth hearing.

Give local music a chance!
Support local talent by attend-
ing the Hurl Swob Shale show
at the Oakland Beehive,
Wednesday, Jan. 24th. it's all
ages, starts at 8 p.m., and is
cheaper than going to some
lame-ass movie!_

The Doom Generation
Written and directed by Gregg
Araki

With James Duval, Rose
McGowan and Johnathan
Schaech

Araki credits The Doom
Generation as “a heterosexual
movie,” a joke_directed at dum-
dum critics more interested in
pegging, pigeonholing and
patronizing the audience (his
last two films were “homosexu-
al”. films), but another credit
tag, “a teen angst movie com-
pany,” got away from him. In
the first two minutes, audi-
ences are prepped to read the
film as part doomed genera-
tion, part teen angst, part why-
not productions and part des-
perate pictures. Cliches like
these will probably go over
well at Slacker, though. The
Doom Generation is one of a
brand of films that couldn’t
have been made until media
jerk-offs decided that-the Nine
Inch‘ Nails ilk were more signif-
icant as voices of a generation
than suburban-white-kids-who-
watch-too-much-tv. g

The Doom Generation
opens with a . typically
grandiose song about God
being dead and no one caring
that blares through an apoca-
lyptic dance club. “Welcome to
Hell” burns the screen. A teen-
noir girl (whose gothic apparel
is at once existential and chic)
looks at the camera, and, with
a disenfranchised “Fuck,” dis-
misses the square establish-
ment. It's just that oh-so-
ni_hilistic the-world-sucks-so-
fuck-off kinda movie “Xers”
need.

The script takes the three
kids through the wringer of
convention, making The Doom
Generation at once a road
movie, a steamy screwe-
palooza and a satire of
“McCu|ture” and the media.
Jordan White (James Duval)

and Amy Blue (Rose
McGowan) are the pill-popping
valleykids Xavier Red

(Jonathon Schaech) takes for
a ride when he jumps in their
car at a drive-in movie theater.
Xavier holds them at gunpoint
while Amy drives and Jordan
makes friends with Xavier —

12 Monkeys
With Bruce Willis, Madeleine
Stowe and Brad Pitt 4
Directed by Terry Gilliam

By the end of 1996 and the
start of 1997, 90 percent of the
Earth's human inhabitants will
be ravaged by a strange, lethal
virus. Happy New Year.

Or, at least, this is how direc-
tor Terry Gilliam ushers it in. in
his first movie since The Fisher
King about four years ago,
Gilliam’s time-warp thriller tells
the story of James Cole (Bruce
Willis), a 21st century prisoner
who is sent back to 1996 to
uncover the cause of the mys-
terious virus that has killed bil-
lions and driven Earth's
remaining population under-
ground.

This alone could serve as a

_ very interesting and exciting

film. This is much too simplistic
for Gilliam, however, and so he
throws in a few curve balls
along the way. Cole is acci-
dentally sent to 1990 and sub-
sequently thrown into an
insane asylum, where he runs
into a curious psychologist
(Madeleine Stowe) and a
hyperactive lunatic (played

Coll Erika or 682-3327

     

with kinetic fury by Brad Pitt),
both of whom will have signifi-
cant roles in Cole’s mission.
Cole also has a strange recur-
ring dream that slowly unravels
as the movie ensues. And, of
course, there’s the mysterious
Army of the Twelve Monkeys.

If this seems like a little too

’ much to digest, it is at times.

Cole is thrown from the future
to the past, to the present and
back to the future again, so
much so that he begins to
question his own sanity. So, in
fact, does the audience.
Gilliam juggles these elements
— and keeps the audience
perplexed over what is and
isn't real '— for over two hours,
enough to confuse anyone,
and offers an ending that may
keep some scratching their
heads in bewilderment as they
leave the theater.

As the unstable protagonist,‘

Willis brings Cole’s character
to life with much more tortured
emotion than we’re used to
seeing him portray. lt’s refresh-
ing to see him offer a wider
range of emotions (the Die
Hard persona fades and we
actually see him weep). Pitt is
much more “alive” here than

1. Seam Am I Driving You

Crazy? (Touch N’ Go
Records)

After the departure of bass
player Lexi Mitchell,

singer/songwriter Sooyoung
Park decided to take a hiatus
from the band and travel to
Korea. He returned with a new
bassist and recorded the
album with the same revolving
mellow guitar dimension for
which Seam is known. Where
bands like Smashing
Pumpkins create a noisy sonic
aggression, fellow Chicagoans
Seam are patient; they let
tempo and mood dictate the
song, eventually leading to a
well-controlled explosion.

2. Superchunk Here’s Where
the Strings Come In (Merge
Records)

The band returns with the
same energy that marked
them on their debut album, No
Pocky For Kitty. There’s

iams    
always something fun about
hopping around like the Worm
getting rebounds listening to a
song.
3. Pavement Wowee Zowee
(Matador Records)

Re-inventing lazy sounds
with quality music. i

4. The Ropers All the Time

(Slumberland Records)

The re-invasion of English
‘80s guitar and Primal Scream
back when they didn't sound
like the Rolling Stones.

5. Flying Saucer Attack
Further (VHS Records)

Acyolates of My Bloody.

Valentine, broadcasters of sta-
tic, and more layers of guitars
than a Fender wedding cake.
6. ‘The Karl Hendricks Trio A
Gesture of Kindness (Fiasco
Records)

Locals present another effort
of distorted guitars and a
jaded heart.

7. Magnetic Fields Get Lost

Over vacation, a delightful
little zine called Beat Off
arrived in my.mailbox._It’s kind
of thin, but it’s about mastur-
bation (what did you think it

was about with a title like"

that?), as well as being free in
exchange for a S.A.S.E.
There’s some personal anec-
dotes on the topic and reviews
of... ah  devices to aid you in

your quest. So you probably

already know -whether you
want it or not. Write: Mike/ 6
Oak Ct./ Poughkeepsie, NY
12603.

And now for something com-
pletely different  I may have
given my readers the impres-
sion that zines by their very
nature automatically deal with
some aspect of underground
culture and th'at_if you’re not
into underground stuff (what-
ever that means), then zines
will not make your reading list.
While it is true that the stuff I
find the most interesting usual-
ly has strong ties to the" under-
ground, I personally (and feel
free to disagree with me)
define a zine as a periodical
produced by a very small
number of people and not

. owned by-a corporation. So in

that light, I am now going to
review The Phoenix, specifi-
cally the November and
December ‘95 issues. Upon
perusing these issues, the
general impression I get from
the editorial tone is a strong
loathing for any economic sys-
tem except free-market econo-
my. But more than that, I find

 

  

a lot of thinly-veiled sexism
and homophobia. These items
from the Top 10 things The
Phoenix wants for Christmas
will speak to that: “A year long
supply of Lady Gillettes for our
friends down at the Womyn’s
Center  More power-driver,
pro-sex, radical lesbian femi-
nists for CMU

Representatives that won’t
soggmize us every chance
they get (no offense, BiGa-LA
and CMU out)  So I know
what you’re saying now.
You’re saying, “John, well then
what would possess me,
praytell, to waste my valuable
time reading it? Is it totally
without merit?” To which I
would answer, “No, dear friend
and beloved reader. lt’s free,
but, better than that, lT’S
DAMNED FUNNY!” To illus-
trate: “Where have all the
Marxists gone? Oh sure 
plenty of them have taken
shelter among the Economics,
Philosophy, and Political
Science Departments of the
prestigious Ivy. League
schools.” But perhaps even
better is the‘ unintentional
humor. To wit, the Pitt
Nursing Students Caught in
Prostitution Ring article in

P the December issue put a joy-

ous grin upon my face that
lasted the better part of the
day. A courageous Phoenix
reporter, funded by an local
nonprofit organization, spent a
agonizing 18 months going to
prostitutes so he could write
this searing exposure. And

In this intimate “chamber” version of a gothic horror story ﬁlled with jealousy
and |ust,_a barber seeks ven eance from the entire city of London for the
destruction of his family.

Sunrfay,

e shaved the faces of
thereafter were heard of again..

what does he give us?
Addresses and fee structures
for each place he visited. He’s
out there finding this stuff out
so we won’t have to do it our-
selves. Oh, the inhumanity of
it all! Now we all know not to
pay much more than $100 for
vaginal intercourse. But is he
taking the slightest pleasure in
all this research? No, of
course not. Says he, “Sadly
these girls are happy making a
living this way. Even more
sadly, many young men are
more than happy to spend
their money on their services.”
As good as this is, it's made
even better by the article (or
really, editorial disguised as
an article) on the same page
defending the Hooters restau-
rant chain. Say I about
Hooters, “Sadly these girls are
happy making a living this
way. Even more sadly, many
young men are more than
happy to spend their money
on their services.” Now, I may
be way off base here, but I
find the unintentional editorial
inconsistency that let these
two articles co-exist on the
same page to be brilliant yet
understated satire. Viewed in
that light, The Phoenix occu-
pies the space that Mad, Spy
and Answer Me! did at their
prime. So pick up The
Phoenix. Read it. Enjoy your-
self. But take it as seriously as
you take Mad magazine.

talented Dave Boquist.
Throughout the course of the
album, Boquist plays guitar,
fiddle, banjo, dobro and lap
steel guitar. He is soulful and
adept throughout the course
of the album and adds some
wonderful touches to Farrar’s
sometimes sparse arrange-
ments. _
Many of the songs on the
album are low-key
acoustic/electric arrangements
with a rootsy country feel.
They boast introspective,
poetic and even political lyrics
that Farrar delivers with con-
viction. On “Live Free,” Farrar
states, “I want to see your
smile through a pay phone.".
On “Tear Stained Eye,” he
asks, “Can you deny there’s
nothing greater than the trav-
elling hands of time?” And on
“Out of the Picture,” Farrar
stands high atop his musical
soapbox and beseeches us to

' “Take away this Columbus

Day/ no more bones on dis-
play/ Blackhawk never had a
say/ just taken out of the pic-
ture.”

January 18 1996       ‘ 7

This album also boasts
some very radio-friendly
tracks such as the FM single
“Drown.” Warner Brothers
slipped some very Hootie-like
graphics and lettering on the
album design. Don't be fooled:
This is not the kind of music

that will set the cast of-

“Friends” into a fit of Yuppie
toe-tapping. On “Drown,” as
on “Route 5” and “Catching
On,” the boys in Sonvolt crank
outsome’ driving, hook-laden,
guitar-driven country grunge
that sounds more like Rust

than the Rembrants. But if you '

want an album that sounds
like “Drown” all the way
through, youare shopping for
the wrong band. Farrar and
company prove that they can
run the gamut from Country
twang to Neil Young rawness
to Folk Blues sensibilities,
harkening back to Exile on
Main Street era Rolling
Stones. They do it all with
class, taste and finesse. You
could not build an album more
solid than Trace. If‘ you are

’ looking for good, simple rock

Lost in Yonkers is a classic

values. The deranged farcical
characters mount in a batty

Mark Morris .
Presented by Pittsburgh
Dance Council

Modern dance reaches new
heights of movement with
Mark Morris’ brilliant choreo-
graphed performance. His sen-
suality is said to be too bold tor
ballet despite his use of
Mozart, Brahms and Bach.
Physical interpretation is an
ancient form of expression that
is spirited by innovative artists
such as Morris. He uses sim-
ple gestures along with satiri-
cal wit in his work that add life
to his rich physical presence.
The show runs on Jan 20th at
the Benedum Center. Call 456-
6666 for more data.

and not something you can sit
still to. For info ‘call the

Two |o’re fouls end

five-gome win sfreok

By Kevin Lilley
Staff Writer

was just minding my busi-

ness at a local South

Oakland drinking establish-
ment the other day when I
bumped into Joey Knuckles, the
notorious inside dopester who
has much more than his foot in
the NCAA’s door. Joey has
been rolling incognito lately
due to an FBI investigation, but
that’s beside the point.

After buying me a drink, Joey
and I embarked on a philosoph-
ical conversation about college
hoops. Knowing darn well that
I’m a starving sports reporter,
Joey started spilling informa-
tion like Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf
does when he holds a full glass
of beer. '

I swore to Joey that I
wouldn’t tell anybody, but his
news was so bowel-moving that
I had to tell everybody who
wanted to listen.

Joey told me that Marcus
Camby, UMass’ stud center,
faked his collapse minutes
before the St. Joe’s game last
Sunday.

But why? Why would one of
the top players in college bas-
ketball fake something like
that? .

And then Joey‘ dropped the
bomb. He said his
Massachusetts informant found
out that Camby faked the col-
lapse because he was having
massive anxiety attacks about
UMass’ upcoming game
against the scorching Pitt
Panthers. Joey said that Camby
couldn’t eat or sleep after he
watched Pitt dismantle the then
No. 5 Georgetown Hoyas.

Reminiscent of the collapses
and subsequent deaths of Hank
Gathers and Reggie Lewis,
Camby knew that his case
would be publicly scrutinized
and doctors would be extra cau-
tious in letting him return. Sure
enough, Camby’s plan worked
to perfection. Despite no heart
abnormalities, UMass’ team
doctor Dr. James-Ralph said
Camby can’t play for two
weeks. - ,?

That means Camby ’won’t be
able to go against Pit_t’s front-
line of Gerald Jordan, Chad
Vargafhandy-Mark _'Bl]ount next

   
 
 

  

:.. A’  ',,,.

The Pitt Panther men’s bas-
ketball team took a five-game
winning streak into New
Jersey last evening in search
of Ralph Williard’s 100th
career coaching victo-
ry. They walked out
with a 78-77 loss to
the Rutgers Scarlet
Knights, committing
over 20 turnovers and .
two late fouls to end
the streak and leave
Willard at 99 career victories.

Pitt controlled the contest up
to the 1:46 point of the second
half when Garrick Thomas
fouled Rutgers’ freshman
Geoff Billet, the Big East’s
leading foul shooter. He made
both free throws, giving the
Scarlet Knights a 75-74 lead.

Pitt couldn’t convert on
their next possession, and
Rutgers center Andrew
Kolbasovsky scored with a
driving layup in transition to
give the Scarlet Knights a
three-point lead at 77-74.

Pitt senior Andre Alridge
seemed to save the day with
29 seconds left, draining a

three-point shot to tie the
game at 77. Pitt’s defense kept
the Scarlet Knights from
launching a shot, but with 0.2
seconds left on the clock
Alridge was called for a foul
on Rutgers’ senior Damon
Santiago.

The call could
be considered ques-
tionable. Or, as coach
Willard said, “That
was the most absurd
call I’ve ever seen.”

“It’s just
unfathomable to me

that ‘anyone would make that
_ call,” added the coach, who

called a timeout after the call
to ice the shooter and discuss
the play with the referee.

After the break, Santiago
missed the first foul shot,
silencing a Rutgers crowd
already celebrating the victo-
ry. He made the second, how-
ever, evening his point total
for the evening at 20 and seal-
ing the win.

“It’s a game we feel we
should’ve won,” said Willard
after the contest. “It’s very
disappointing.”

The last-second loss ruined

The University of Pittsburgh women’s
basketball team won their second game
of the season last night, upsetting the
Georgetown Lady Hoyas 80-74 at
McDonough Arena in Washington, D.C.

The long awaited win snapped the
Lady Panthers 12 game losing streak.

Trailing 35-33 at the half, the Lady
Panthers outscored Georgetown 47-39 in
the second half behind 52 percent shoot-
ing and 16 converted free throws.

Starting shooting guard Stephaniei.
Petho once again led the Lady Panthers‘

in scoring with a game-high 22 points,
while shooting 8 of 14 from the field.

Sophomore center Latia Howard tickled ’
the twine for 14 points while collecting’

eight rebounds, five on the offensive
glass. Joanne “JoJo"’ Guzman scored 13
points and Melissa Thompson con-
tributed with 11 points and eight
rebounds.

Leading the way for the Lady Hoyas
was forward Ebiho Ahonkhai, earning
herself a spot on Georgetown’s all-name
team, with 15 points. Center Sylita
Thomas pulled down a game-high 10
rebounds.

The win ends the longest losing streak A

in Head Coach Kirk Bruce’s career. Their,

first conference victory also raises the _
teams season record to 2-14. Pitt hosts V

Tuesday at the Fitzgerald Field House. It’s a major
blow to the No.1-ranked Minutemen, but Camby
got exactly what he wanted.

Joey’s report is, of course, unconﬁrmed, but
when I called the UMass basketball ofﬁce, offi-
cials refused comment. .

After Joey and I ﬁnished our drinks, I thanked
him for his information and left. But it was still
early, so I went to another local watering hole
across the street.

As I walked in, I spotted Frankie Fixx sitting at
the end of the bar talking to two young females. I
immediately took advantage of the situation. I
maneuvered my way towards him, acting as non-
chalant as PanthervPaul at an all—you-can-eat buf-
fet. When Frankie saw me, he gestured for me to
come over.

Bingo. You see, Frankie is a Las Vegas kingpin.
He has his clammy little hands all over the
nation’s gambling action. He used to run numbers
back in the old neighborhood, but now he’s
moved on to bigger and badder things. Now
Frankie is one of the henchmen who makes the
betting lines, ﬁxes the games, pays oﬂ“ the refs. As
he lit up a cigarette, I conveniently asked him
about the Super Bowl. I noticed the empty glasses
to his right, so I knew he would sing like Mel
Torme on crack. I had him, and there was nothing
he could do about it.

the road, Frankie gave a swift nod of the head and
his company took a walk. Then he started to talk.

As Frankie stared intimately into his gin and
tonic glass, he said, “Man, do you believe that
spread? Them Texans are in for a rude awaken-
ing.” Frankie was referring to the Steelers-
Cowboys point spread. Dallas is favored by 13.5
and rising. That makes the Steelers the fourth
biggest underdog in Super Bowl history. I realize
the NFC has monopolized the Super Bowl, but
this is ridiculous.

Frankie, still keeping his eyes away from mine,
said, “It’s a big joke in Vegas, but those bow-
legged rednecks are riding this game like
Christopher Reeve. If you’re a gambling man, I
think you know what you should do.”

“Yea, but I’m not a gambling man — it’s moral-
ly wrong, “ I replied.

As I turned to the waitress to order a drink for
the two of us, Frankie slipped out the back with-
out saying goodbye.

He knew that he’d screwed up. He basically
told me that the Super Bowl line is a sucker bet —
that Vegas is on the take and who knows what
else.

Of course you know that Frankie’s inside tip is
just that — an unconﬁrmed report from one guy. I
called Vegas yesterday, but they refused comment.

°From page 7
Thomas’s career—high 22
points, which included the
first 8 of the ballgame for the
Panthers. Thomas led Pitt on a
20-7 run to start off the con-
test, but Panther turnovers and
fouls allowed the Scarlet
Knights to close the gap to 35-

' 30 at intermission.

Chad Varga started the scor-
ing in the second half with a
running one-handed layup to
give Pitt the early momentum.
Thomas was fouled behind the
are on the next possession and
drained all three foul shots to
give the Panthers a 10-point
cushion. Pitt kept control,
holding a double—digit lead as
late as the 11-minute mark in
the second period.

After a Rutgers timeout
with 10:19 remaining, the
Scarlet Knights took control
for good. Santiago made a
three-point shot on the next
possession, before a flurry of
fouls took the game to the
charity stripe for the next few
possessions.

Led by Billet and fellow
freshman Billy Gilligan,

Rutgers went 14-18 from the ,

line for the rest of the contest,
gaining huge ground on the
Panthers without taking time
off the clock. Pitt shooters did
not keep up with the barrage.

“We didn’t make our free
throws when we had to,” said
Willard after the contest.

Willard also took the team
to task for managing only
seven offensive rebounds for
the night. '

“You can’t win basketball
games like that,” said the
coach. “We had strictly an
outside game.”

The Panthers hope to
rebound this Saturday when
they travel to Florida to face
the Miami Hurricanes. Miami
is currently 2-4 in Big East
play, but returned four starters
from a club that reached the
NIT last season, including
ultra-quick point guard Kevin
Norris. Tipoff is scheduled for
7:30 p.m. and will be tele-
vised on KBL.
