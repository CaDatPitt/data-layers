POINT OF INFORMATION—Martha Jane Dickson, Religion-in-‘

Life committee member, questions Dr. Clarence L. Jordan; founder

of’ Koinonia farm, on the life of

the community" during a ﬁreside

chat in the Commons Room, Wednesday. , '

By JACK MARKOWITZ

An economic brotherhood based on love, com-
munal living, and an equal sharing of goods—that
is how ﬁve families in southern Georgia are ap-
plying to life the principles of Christianity, accord-
ing to Dr. Clarence L. Jordan, who spoke at Re-
ligion—in-Life meetings here this week.

A founder, in 1942, of the 640-acre farm com-
munity, Dr. Jordan told his tudent audiences that
he and his neighbors are translating into reality the
implications of the faith preached by Christ.

He said that the 20 people living on the farm,
called Koinonia———a Greek word meaning “fellow-
ship”--I‘ believe that Christ preached that all peo-
ple are of one “family” bound together by the
spirit.

Since parents and children live communally,
sharing the income of the family, the Koinonia
group wants to extend this sharing to include the
greater “fami1y”—all people——bound together by
love. ’

Diﬁers From Russia

But Dr. Jordan emphasized that the communal

life, which differs from Russian communism in that

 

Religion Speaker Tells o fLi fe  

On Georgia Communal F arm

it is voluntary and based on love rather than force,
is effective only on a small scale. The people at
Koinonia’ would like to see the establishment of
many similar small communities, rather than the
setting up of unwieldly large ones, Dr. Jordan said.

The farm community consists of four families
with children and three single men. Each family
lives in a house of its own, but the entire group
comes together for two meals a day and regular
business and policy meetings. -

Outdoor work on the farm is done by the seven
men—one takes care of the 40 head of cattle, an-
other the poultry, the others working in the ﬁeld
raising oats, peanuts, and corn.

Farm Is Non-Proﬁt .

According to Gil Butler, a member of the com-
munity who accompanied Dr. Jordan to the con-
ference here, the farm operates on a non—profit
basis. Koinonia attempts only to “make a living.”

The community’s four women do chores, take
care of the nine children, and cook the afternoon

and evening meals (the men, who turn out at 6 A

a.m. prepare breakfast).

MC Seeks Student Discount

the latest idea of Men’s Council.

\ According to Ronald Ecker, ﬁve large men’s furnishing‘
stores have been asked whether¢

they would consider giving ah/five
or ten. per cent discount to stu-
dents if their stores were recom-
mended to the student body.

Ecker said that three of the es-
tablishments have said that they
“were interested, but would re-
quire more details on the propo-
sition.”

Student. Reaction Waited

Acting with the council special
projects ‘committee, Ecker said
that he plans to contact other
stores, but would like‘ to know

what student reaction is to the

idea.

He pointed out that many stores.

might consider such a deal, be-
cause the discount loss would be
offset by an increased volume of
trade from the students.

On the subject of freshmen
keys, Dan Purdy suggested that
the Panther Key ceremonies be
held this year on Scholars’ Day.

Religion Week
At SFM Meet

Brother E. Anthony, principal
of Central Catholic High School,
officially ended Religion-in-Life-
Week yesterday when he spoke at
the closing assembly of students
and faculty at Stephen Foster Me-
morial. .’

“It falls to college students who
have been blessed with the privi-
lege of a higher education to pro-
duce a better world,” Brother
Anthony told the group.

“Young men and women who

have qualiﬁed to go to college
should logically be expected to use
their talents for the betterment of
mankind,” he declared.

Brother Anthony called Relig-

ion-in-Life Week “an excellent
idea, something we should compli-
ment the students on. The idea is
an answer to those who say
American college students are not
thinkers and are falling away from
God.”

Dr. Frank Wilson, dean of the
school of religion, Howard Univer-
sity, summed up the effectiveness
of Religion-In-Life—Week for the
speakers.

“The program as planned by
the students for the University
Community,” he said, “has helped
demonstrate the importance of the
religious factor in University life
and American culture.”

“Through work in classrooms
and resident fraternities and so-
rorities, serious consideration has
been given to the major ap-
proaches to religion . . . in day-
to-day affairs.”

Religion-in-Life-VVeek I
Makes Students Think

, By ELINORE STONE
Religion-in-Life Week, which ended yesterday, brought
religion closer to the campus than it has been at any other

time in the year.

In an effort to ﬁnd out what students thought of the

program, they were polled on
“What is the purpose of Religion-
in-Life Week.” Their opinions fol-
low:

Cecil Sipe, Pre-med senior, be-
lieves its purpose is “to give stu-
dents a better understanding of the
religion of others and to show
where religion stands in modern
American life.” I

Jacqueline Sulick, College ’55,
said, “I think it’s to wake up some
students and make them see that
there’s more going on in life that
many of them realize.” _

College senior, Cyril Wecht feels
that, “a student can get lost in all
the activity here at school and for-
get who he is and why he’s here.
tReligion-in—Life Week brings his
attention to these questions.”

Suzanne Janos, College sopho-
more, expressed the opinion that

this week “serves to make the av-

thing we all take pretty much for

Education senior, Daniel Spil-
lane answered, “The purpose of
such a week is to enable the stu-
dents to see their relationship with
God and their need for faith in
him.”

A freshman in the College,
James Miller, feels that “the dis-
cussions and speeches offered at
this time enable us all to hear
some of the greatest religious
leaders speak at Pitt.”

Bus. Ad. junior, Ronald Ecker,
stated its purpose as “to help the

their own and to provide an in-

*

By JOAN LISOTTO
“It’s me in reverse,” says Sue
Delphey about her present role in
the'Pitt Players production, “You
Touched Me." _
In her estimation it is the tough-
est role which she has ever at-

tempted. As the captain’s daugh-
ter, she is psychologically shy.
She is quiet and withdrawn, com-
parable to “Ophelia” in “Hamlet.”

Before rehearsals Sue gets her-
self into the mood of the char-
acter by maintaining complete si-
lence and thinking of slowly mov-
ing waters. She says that she has
to practically ﬂoat across the stage.
And Sue says, “I’m anything but
the ﬂoating kind.”

Five on the Record

Even so, Sue, who has already
appeared in ﬁve out of six Player
shows, for which she was eligible,
is especially pleased with her. new
role. “Most of my other parts have
been character roles. At last I’m
playing an ingenue romantic lead,
and I even get my man,” she said.

Sue, who is a writing major,
has been acting ever since grade
school. She appeared in four sen-
ior class’ plays at Peabody High
School and numerous productions
in her church dramatic club. She
also was awarded a scholarship
to the Caravan School of Theater
Arts.

Of all her roles, Sue considers
her part of “Goudie” in “The Sus-
pect” as her most memorable. Sue,
who is rather tall and thin, was
playing a maid who was supposed
to be short and squat.

Lots of Stuﬁing

In an -effort to ﬁt her psysically
for the part, the costume crew ob-
tained a huge lace-up corset.'They
wrapped her in the corset and
stuffed it with yards and yards of
material. C

During dress rehearsal, Sue
made her first entrance and part
of her stuﬁing dropped. She walk-
ed to the center of the stage and

lost another roll of material. By

the time she moved to the left
stage, still another bolt of cloth
dropped to the ﬂoor.

Said Sue, “When I was just
making my exit, my fanny drop-
ped and the whole darn costume
fell apart.” She added with a
smile, “I really left my mark on
that stage, didn’t I?”

Major Disaster

Of all the mishaps which she
has encountered during her act-
ing career, Sue thinks that the
worst was during the Player’s per--
formance of “Beggar on Horse-
back.” She was doing a take-oﬁ
on a dizzy typist and the light
crew was supposed to throw a
single spot on her. But when the
switch was thrown, an empty desk
on the opposite side of the stage
got the beam, and Sue had to per-
form in the dark. '

Her favorite role was that of
“Jocasta” in “Oedipus Rex.” Sue
says that it was the most dramatic
part she had ever attempted.

In speaking of “You Touched,
Me,” Sue said, “The audience
certainly ought to have an en-
ergetic evening, laughing V at the
antics of the old sea captain and
crying at the plight of the young
lovers.”

Freehof Asserts World
IsHungry for Peace

Rabbi Solomon Freehof told an estimated‘ 250 students
Wednesday that there “is a great hunger for peace in the

world today.”

Rabbi Freehof said the hunger comes from a realization
that we “are on the verge of destruction.”

Speaking on “Religion in .\Modern Literature,” Rabbi
Freehof said this realization arises’ t ~ '

from the knowledge that the
“great ideals hate each other.”

i Once, he said, men felt_that ,“great

ideals” could live together.
Cannot Go-Exigv
Now we are faced with the ap-
palling fact thattthey cannot co-

exist. He called the three great

ideals of man, capitalism, social-
ism and communism.

In literature Dr. Freehof saw a
change from the confusion and fu-
tility of the past three decades to
a (belief  spiritual eternity and
the continuity of man.

He cited Thomas Mann as an ex-
ample of a man who began his
career writing of confusion and
disintegration and who is now en-
grossed in the search for spiritual
eternity. ‘

‘ Social Values Sought

- ,A. J. Cronin,‘ he said,‘ gained

fame by writing of social confu-
sion and the breakdown of ideals.
In “Keys of the Kingdom,” Cronin
is concerned with re-creating so-
cial values. E‘

U Drf Freehof pointed to the best-_
seller lists as another sign that

truths. For the past decade at least

Go Political

Student political clubs have rarely been
an issue on this campus because they have
rarely gotten beyond the discussion stage.
‘During the 1948 campaign a few abortive
moves were made towards organizing parti-
san support for the various candidates, ‘note-
worthy among them being the much—_public-
pized but inconsequential group which backed
‘Henry Wallace. Aside from an increased
amount of discussion every four years, Pitt
students have largely ignored political action.

This year there is again a certain amount
of talk about organizing political clubs. It
has even gotten to the stage where a Taft
group is asking University recognition. No
decision has as yet been announced.

Political action has largely been frowned‘

upon here. If any reason has been given it is
because Pitt depends on the State for a large
percentage of its income. The feeling seems
to be that our legislators will frown upon
any political groups which might oppose
their own.

If Pitt turns out to be a hotbed of Tru-
manism, the argument goes, the predomi-
nantly Republican legislature may take a
wack at ou_r appropriation.

But the whole argument that student po-
litical clubs-on the campus, composed of stu-

‘ dents and aimed at rousing student interest,

will hurt the standing of the University in
Harrisburg sounds more than just exagger-
ated. If anything,it is timidly carried to its
logical conclusion; the avoidance of doing
anything at all. ,

Such an attitude enables the student to
escape the University without training at all

has been discouraged from doing anything
during his four years here, it is logical to as-
sume that he will continueto be discour-
aged when he leaves. Here you have a clue
to where the missing 50 per cent of the peo-
ple are who fail to even vote.

The University’s approach to political
clubs is based on imagined gears. They are
windmills. and after all, a windmill is just
a windmill.

The University should okay the clubs.

Court Explains Queen

Editor
Titt News

On Commencement Day a speaker will
give to the graduating seniors a challenge
,. . . the challenge of what they should stand
for in the world today. On Coronation Day
the ’woman students say what valuesthey
will stand for in the world. We need such
a positive ideology; society needs it.

Today the Communists are articulate
about their ideology. We don’t want a nega-
tive policy which just states that “WE DON’T
WANT A POLICE STATE.” We want the
positive values expressed in our Coronation
which embodies the best any human being
stands for.

This is why you will ﬁnd the women on
campus talking about a Senior Queen. We
know ours is not a so-called’ beauty queen,
but she does symbolize beauty . . . the beauty
of truth, theibeauty of mercy, the beauty of
valor. We ﬁnd a crying need for such quali-
ties in our government today. The American
public_ and the world lament that in high
places there is a lack of truth and of valor
. . . that quality of mind that gives us the

L courage to stand for truth. ‘

Now, the University of Pittsburgh does
not conduct. citizenship classes; nor do we
as students appreciate any professor ham-
mering morals at us in class.
~ However, once a year the senior women
‘of this University stop before leaving their
formal education to emphasize a part of
education which is rarely stressed. In ef-
fect, three hundred senior women take the
time to say, “Our book learning is over, but,
before we leave to apply the facts we’ve
learned at the University, we want to crys-
tallize the values we will stand for in the
sworld.”

The Queen receives the symbols of office
from Alma Mater who, in charging her,
charges all seniors to use their college edu-
cation constructively. The girl chosen Senior
Queen will symbolize all senior women . . .
for, in democratic fashion, each senior
woman will place a crown on her own head
at Coronation and thus accepts the true
tmeaning and the sober responsibility of Uni-
versity training. ,

Politics on Campus ?- -Yes

JACK MARKOWITZ

The issue- of the University’s
agreement or refusal to sanction

_ student political movements may

well be the most important of
the year.

Faced in the past with incipi-
ent Campus groups allied with
the Democrat— -
ic and Repub-
lican parties
University ad-
m i n i stration _

precedent this 1

 

nation for re-
fusing to sanction the politicos
has been that, since much of the
University’s income is appropri-
ated by the state legislature, it
would be healthier if the school
avoided appearing to support any
political party. If Pitt were to
appear to be a Democratic
stronghold, the Republicans in
Harrisburg might put the squeeze
on the yearly appropriation, and
vice versa.

The administration has a real
problem here, but while its so-
lution—the ban on political clubs

-—is understandable, it is not jus-

tiﬁable.
Fears Exaggerated
First, the University’s fears‘

seem to be exaggerated. Student
political organizations w o u l d
have ‘no closer connection with

the administration than the mere .

use of University property for
meetings, speakers’ assemblies,
and posting of notices. It is hard
to see how a legislator could
construe the granting of a meet-
ing room as University support
of the political views of_a given
organization. ‘ I

This objection becomes doubly
meaningless, when it is virtually
certain that both major political

parties will have student groups
here. In no sense would the Uni-
versity be held responsible for
either group. —

The suspicion is that the Uni-
versity does not consider this ob-
jection the most important one.
It is just that the school would
like to avoid the embarrasment
of having its students become too
noisy in such a tainted ﬁeld as
politics. ,

But the fact is that, for all the
unseemly reputation “politics”
has acquired in America, it is
still the method by which we
elect Presidents and Congress-
men and decide the issues that
affect the lives of everyone, stu-
dents included.

What Is Citizenship?

It is no particular credit to a
student that he view the election
from afar, judiciously satisfy
himself as to the relative merits
of the candidates, and cast a sin-
gle pure vote in November. One
intelligent vote counts no more
than an unintelligent one.

It is up to the intelligent per-
son, the student, that he try to
convince others to vote for his
candidate, that he get out the
vote on election day, that he, in

..a word, immerse himself in poli-

tics-—and on the only convenient
level, the campus. That is citi-
zenship, or should be, in a re-
public. . t

In 1952 especially, with fairly
big questions to be decided, the
University should not only not
forbid, but actively encourage the ~
entrance of students into national
political affairs by giving the
okay to Dan Pu.rdy’s “Students
for Taft” group and any others
that are formed.

This fear on the part of the ad-
ministration of taking a step that
might possibly offend someone,
this resignation to keeping the
mouth shut, is not a healthy at-
titude.

The Big Nose
I BOB THOMAS

You read a lot nowadays about the state stick-
ing its big nose into education.

Well, the big nose has crept into the Ca-
thedral. Right now it is sniffing through the hall!
and casting its suspicious way into University of-
ﬁces and into the minds of the men that run
them.

I don’t know how long the
big nose has been here-—probably
quite a while. The fact is I just
noticed itvthe other day.

That was when I heard about
Men’s Council passing a resolu-
tion asking the University to
sanction some student political
clubs on this campus.

I thought to myself, “Now
there’s a good idea. Should be _
a good thing. We could have a Taft Club, and a
Truman Club, and one for Ike. Real good.”

But then I heard the rest of the story, heard

.v. . '.‘.
A

I about Dean of Men Biddle’s statement that there

was only a slim chance the clubs would be" recog-
nized. I

I listened, also, to his reasons.
Purdy from Men’s Council that, “The University
is state endowed and cannot show any political

partiality. . . ”

And I heard the rest of his reason,.so typical
I thought of what you hear nowadays—“Any poli-
tical organization permitted on campus,” he said,
“would subject the University to criticism as a
prejudiced institution.”

That’s when I knew that the big nose of state
intervention had arrived. Like I have said, I was
not aware of its presence around here before.
Now I am. . _

Now, too, I know why so many people have

fought so hard to keep the state's big nose out

of their schools. Now I can see why the American
Medical Association has even gone so far ‘as to
assess its members for a campaign to bloody the
big nose before it gets into the medical schools.

For this little incident here at Pitt——the small-
est of skirmishes in the world battle of govern-
ment and state versus the individual—has shown
me what happens once the nose gets past the back
door of education.

I see suddenly the fear, and uncertainty, and
intellectual back-trailing that it brings with its
touch. In this case at Pitt, it is the fear of dis-

pleasing the master, the cruel but nebulous state \"

\

which doles out the money. _

For education in general, it is the fear of dis-
agreeing with the dogmatic political bias which has
become our government._

I can only hope that you who read this ‘will
also see the tracks which the big nose of the state
has left here at Pitt.

Small Peanuts

mcx smock

Several weeks ago— Mr. Gabe Rubin, manager
of the Nixon Theater, informed the News that he
was rescinding our complimentary‘pass privileges.

Mr. Rubin said that he regretted having to do
this. He added that he was “quite satisﬁed with
the competence and fairness” of the News’s re-
viewer, but since college reviews of Nixon shows
were “without precedent” he felt

the downtown newspapers.

It seems to me that Mr. Ru
bin’s precedence is a shallow and
shortsighted way of saying h
doesn’t think the News is bi

 

 

 

Here he could not be more mis
taken. '

His audiences of tomorrow 3 _ _
are at Pitt today. The Nixon’s future lies with
people who appreciate the theater enough to at-
tend it regularly, and the majority of"this group
are college graduates. A student who at present.
can barely afford the balcony will be Mr. Rubin’!
customer in the orchestra section a couple years
from now.

Mr. Rubin is a likeable guy. He is not only en-
titled to his opinion, but he is in a position to en-
force it. The only difference of opinion I ever
had with him concerned “Peter Pan” which came
to the Nixon with the season’s most abominable.
staging, plus Miss Veronica Lake. .

Mr. Rubin felt that since the other Pittsburgh
reviewers-—Cohen, Krug, and Monahan——-were uni-

  

’ formly in favor of the show, that I had been a bit

harsh.

However, I have never been able to account
for what I consider .the boundless charity of the
other critics concerning “Peter Pan,” and felt that
my review was more or less vindicated whenthe
show expired quietly in Chicago three weeks after
leaving P Pittsburgh. '

Mitt Field Too Small

Fins HaVeEBest Chance ‘

For Crown in 13 Years

By DON SCHURMAN
lt’s been twelve long years since a Pitt swimming team
won the Eastern Collegiate swimming title.
But unless Ben Grady’s current entry is successful at

the annual championships _ in

New York today and tomor-

row, the thirteenth will be the longest.

This seemingly wild comparison is based on the fact-

that in regular season competition, this year’s crew has al-

ready revamped every Pitt pool
record "except that of the 400-yard
‘free style event.

Chances Good—-on Paper

They have also ended the reg-
ular season with one of the best
Pitt swimming records in years, a
10-3-1 accomplishment.

Even Coach Grady acknowl-
edges, “We have a great chance to
take first place this year. We’re
deep enough, and we have good
team balance.” 2

Assistant Coach Al Ciocca opti-

mistically adds, “On paper we ﬁg-

ure to win.”

Finished Third Last Year

A win tomorrow would also do
much to ease the sting of last
year’s _heart-breaking showing.

Although Al Ciocca, now grad-
uated, won the.__ diving title and the
relay team setia new meet rec-
ord, Pitt ﬁnished third—two points
behind the winning Rutgers and
Seton Hill teams. Both had tied
for ﬁrst place with 67 points.

Despite their good team show-
ings, though, the Panthers have in
the past three years won only four
ﬁrst place medals, two of which
went to Al Ciocca.

With eleven potential champions
competing, however, this situa-
tion could easily be remedied to-

Harriers Feature of Tourney

Coach Carl Olson’s harriers tan-

lead a host of Pitt men in the 50-

Not that Sarge doesn’t welcome

the enthusiasm at the Stadium
dugout, but there just isn’t space
to put them.

For example, 23 battery candi-
dates—17 pitchers and six catch-
ers—are making bids for eight or
nine posts with the Panthers this
spring.

“It’s the best battery turnout
we’ve had in years,” said Bobby
Lewis, who is assisting Mitterling
with the workouts. “We’ve got a
ﬁne—looking group of inﬁelders,
too.” 

Positions Open

Only at ﬁrst base, where veter-
ans Bill Marhefka and Pat Mur-
phy, go at it, are the younger as-
pirants shutout. Around the horn
-—second, third, and short-—-com-
petition is keenest.

The three outﬁeld positions are
clear for any trio of hard-hitting
recruits. Mitterling only has Mur-
phy back from the outﬁeld and the
red -headed senior has ambitions
for ﬁrst base. V

District Foes

The Pitt riﬂemen, coached
by Sgt. Paul Bryant, are in the
thick of the race for the
Greater Pittsburgh League title.
Two important weekend matches
will do much toward writing the
final chapter to the 1951-52 season.

Friday night the Jungle Cat
marksmen will be pitted against
their cross-town rivals from Du-
quesne, whom they have defeated
in two previous encounters.

On Saturday afternoon at 1:30
p.m. Bryant’s sharpshooters will
seek revenge against the unde-
feated West Virginia riﬂemen at
the Stadium. The Mountaineers
squeezed out a 1403-1388 victory
at Morgantown in their ﬁrst en-
counter with the Pitt squad.

A Pitt victory would move the
“gallery archers” from Skyscrap-
er U. with a 6-1 record into a ﬁrst
place tie with the West Virginians,
who have compiled a 7-0 chart.

Joe Resutek Paces Reserves

To Another Win

ed an impressive 11-4 record has
the curtain rang down on the
1951-52 season, Coach Edgar Jones’
proteges averaged 59.7 points per

Joe Resutek of Johnstown Cath-

Sports Editor

Pitt may go out of the city to play its‘ home baseball

games this year.

Right now with the ﬁrst diamond game less than a month
away, the problem of where to play the home games is one

of concern.

Last year’s home bailiwick—-the Stadium—is having
a face-‘lifting in preparation for the fall. Schenley Oval

looms as a question of whether?

Pitt cares to play there again.
Intramural Director Leo Bemis

6 is planning on

the use of the
Oval to run off
the ’ intramural
softball leagues.

D u q u e s ne,
w h i c h u s e d
Mellon Field in
the ‘East End,
may switch its
allegiance. to
Moore Field in
Brookline this
year. If so, Pitt
may consider the use of Mellon
Field for its home games.

. . But the Athletic Department

. is not forgetting West Field in
Munhall. Last year Pitt played
Notre Dame there on a. Saturday
afternoon before one of the
largest crowds ever to see the
Panther cleaters. A hand collec-
tion amounted to more than $70.

Night Games in Oﬁing

Munhall Councilman William
Knight, who is also Chairman of
Recreation, when asked about Pitt
playing an Munhall, replied, “It’s
all right by me, but Council will
have to approve it. I believe that
if Pitt submits dates we can work
something out.”

This year at West Field the
high school will use the ﬁeld one
afternoon a. week and the Little
League expects to play there

IM Sports

Underway

Three minor, yet well repre-
lented, sports highlight the intra-
mural winter card as fraternity
and independent teams swing into
‘action.

‘As usual the better-organized
fraternity loop jumped the gun

on the independents, starting ping -

pong and badminton competition

. last Tuesday.

The independents begin ping
pong action Monday with 32 sin-
gles players and ten doubles team
All-Campus
honors. \

Eighteen ‘four-man ping pong’

teams vie for the Greek champion-
ship in a round-robin tournament.
While in badminton 16 frats will
match swats for trophies.
‘Intramural Director Leo Bemis
hopes to get 35 to 40 teams in ac-
tion next week in volleyball com-
petition. He plans to have, ﬁve
house leagues, one for the under-
graduate fraternities and four in-
tramural-—Engineer, Professional,
Independent, and Pickup.

John George

Loses ‘Some’

Hustling Johnny George, who
was successful in his only inter-
collegiate wrestling meet this sea-
son, will compete as a 130-pound-
er in the 4l"s tourney next Friday
at Cleveland. '

At the start of the week George
weighed 135 pounds. He had hopes
of reducing 12 pounds and com-
peting in the 123-pound division,
but the challenge was too much.

ﬁve‘ days a week. But there is
nothing stopping the University,
from playing night games.

Knight said it was all right by
him, and Carver said that Pitt
would be happy to play night ball
if the opposition approves of it.
What More Do You Want?

Last year’s Notre Dame game
could have been the ﬁrst after-
dark game in Pitt’s history, but the
Irish balked at the idea and the
game was reeled offon Saturday
afternoon.

Before this, Pitt had a chance to
make history when a night tilt was
slated at Waynesburg, but the ele-
ments cancelled th e proposed
meeting. So the Pitts are still
looking for a night contest and a
home ﬁeld for its mitt games. They
could ﬁnd both at West Field in
Munhall.

Phi Gams Edge Phi Eps, 56-55;
Sigma Chi Trounces Kappa Nu

By HAROLD SWENSON
A tap-in by Lowell Simonson as the game ended, pro-
vided the difference as Phi Gamma Delta downed Phi Epsilon
Pi, 56-55, in what was probably the wildest game played

this year in IF competition.
The slim margin isn’t the only
sad note being wailed by the Phi
Eps, for the loss also eliminates
them from IF running. _The victory
gives the Fijis -a 15-2 slate and

boosts them from second place in-»

to a tie with Delta Tau Delta for
ﬁrst place. "

At. the end of the ﬁrst quarter
the Phi Gams jumped to the lead,
12-8, as they repeatedly drove
through the Phi Eps’ zone defense
for easy lay—up shots.

The second period showed both
quintets tightening their defenses
and resorting to longer shots to
score. The Phi Eps faired better
from the outside and narrowed the
gap to 26-24.

In the third quarter the Fijis
grabbed a seemingly comfortable
lead, 34-28, but this was quickly
overcome as the Phi Eps bounced
back and pulled ahead, 37-36. The
lead again changed hands and the
Phi Gams led, 40-39, as‘ the quar-
ter closed.

The Phi Eps quickly pulled
away in the fourth period and
with four minutes and 20 seconds

remaining had a 55-45 margin.
The Fijis fought back to within
one point and then gained the edge
as Simonson sank the clincher.

Slgs Wallop Kaps

It took a last minute desperation
shot to do it, but “Herk” Duncan
outscored Kappa Nu, 33-31, at the
Stadium Wednesday, as Sigma Chi
slaughtered the Kaps, 7-5-3-1.

Big Herk connected for 15 ﬁeld
goals and three fouls as he hit

ll

from almost every angle and con-
trolled both boards so effectively

-that Kappa Nu was out of the

game from the start.

Duncan started the route with
three straight ﬁelders and Bob An-

dres hit for two more before Pam

Haﬁner scored for the Kaps on a
long set shot. The half ended with
Sigma Chi in front, 39-13.

. , Cathedral Conflagration
Remote Possibility

By JIM DICKEY _
“If a ﬁre hits’ the Cathedral, don’t worry about it, we’re
well prepared,” says’ George Butch, acting chief of Truck

Number 14 on Neville St.

“It is very doubtful if a serious ﬁre could ever develop

in the building, because it is com-
pletely ﬁre—proof.”

, ‘flf a ﬁre would break out, he
added “it wouldn’t have a chance

started.”
Further ﬁre protection comes
from four water storage tanks and

one emeregncy ﬁre tank inside
the Cathedral.

Reserve Supply

According to Earl Crawford,
foreman of the University plum-
bers, thisgives the school a re-
serve supply of 30,700 gallons of
water literally “on tap.”

These four water storage tanks
-—in the basement, on the 14th,
24th, and 38th ﬁoors——ﬁll the gen-
eral water needs of the building.
However, they can be used, along
with the emergency ﬁre tank on
the 39th ﬂoor in case of a ﬁre.

Seventy one ﬁre “stations” in
the,Cathedral makegit possible to
ﬁght a ' ﬁre effectively on‘ any
floor. Each of these stations has
approximately 75 feet of one and

 

one half inch hose which is in-
spected rigidly every six months.

Fire During Construction

There have been ﬁres in the Ca-
thedral, but only one has been bad.
It occurred during the construc-

\
The ﬁre started on the fourth

floor and ﬂamed up to the tenth
ﬂoor through a pipe shaft whichi
acted as a ﬂue. Worker’s scaffolds
then caught ﬁre, making it neces-
sary to call the ﬁre department.
This freak accident was not too
costly, however. Only a small
amount of material was burned,

Queen Candidates
Picked Monday

Prominent senior women are
facing a weekend of suspense.

From ﬁve to eight candidates for
Senior Queen will be announced
at a Rose Tea Monday afternoon
at 3:30 p.m. in the Commons
Room.

Senior women will vote next
Wednesday to pick one of the
women named as outstanding
among 29-0 classmates Monday.

She will be named Senior Queen
on Tap Day, and the others will
make up her court at a Coronation
ceremony in June.

all

but it is still estimated to be the
biggest ﬁre in the history of the
Cathedral.
Climb Steps

_ Chief Butch said, “At that time
we had to climb the steps because
there were no elevators. And if
you don’t think that was a job
carrying hoses up ten ﬂoors, you
should have been along.”

A huge pump in the basement
of the Cathedral is" the biggest
defense against ﬁre. It can supply
750 gallons of water per minute
to any ﬂoor.

As a ﬁnal touch, hose outlets big
enough for a two and one—half
inch line were put on every ﬂoor
when the building was under con-
struction. _

Small Fires

“There have been a few small
ﬁres in the Cathedral since its
construction,” said Chief Butch.
“However, there is 110 doubt in
my mind that this building is one
of the best protected in the city
against ﬁre hazards.”

Normally, chemical engineers en-
ter production supervision by reason
of preference and special abilities.
Their ﬁrst step depends on which of
ten operating departments they work
in. For example, in one department
they follow a training program as
student operators. In another, train-
ing in a plant laboratory familiarizes
the engineers with processes and

products.

1 . Occasionally, in a still connected
to a sulfonator by a pipe line with a
single valve,theproductdisappeared,
and residue increased. The supervi-
sor’s study of control data showed
that small amounts of gaseous sul-
fur trioxide were venting into the
still causing decomposition of the
product. His recommended installa-
tion of a positive pressure block in
the pipe line eliminated the diﬂiculty.

2 . A high temperature batch reaction
process was revised to increase pro-
duction of a critical material. For
safety, adjacent reactors had to be
shut down as work on each unit pro-
ceeded . The supervisor planned main-
