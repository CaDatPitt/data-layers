  Haddad Reveals Council  

Rented Music Hall for Gates

By-MARGI STUMPF
Pitt News Staff Writer
Tammy Haddad, Pitt Union
Program Council chairwoman, said
Monday that the council paid to use
Carnegie Music Hall for two Chuck
Man gione concerts held Friday and
Saturday, Oct. 13 and 14.

Only the Saturday night show was
in conjunction with Pitt’s Home-
coming. The Friday night show,
Haddad said, was handled strictly
by Gates Music, Mangione’s
manager. C

Jack Brown, the council’s advis-
or, said a written agreement was
made with the council and Gates
that stipulated the program council

3%.

_ ‘would sign for the hall and pick up

-the tab for rentalexpenses, and
Gates would then reimburse the
council by check.

The contract with the program
council’s name on it was in
accordance with a Carnegie Music
Hall rule which stipulates that only

non-proﬁt organizations may use
those facilities. Both Brown and
Haddad, however, stated that
Gates—a proﬁt-motivated organi-
zation—was the actual operator on‘
Friday night. '

Askedif the Carnegie Music Hall
booking office was aware Gates _was
the party involved with Mangione’s
ﬁrst performance, Brown said “I
guess when the University rents the
facilities, Carnegie assumes they
will use them.”

Mrs. Bernita ,.«Mills, a Carnegie-

Institute representative who hand- .

led the -bookingof the hall, said she
was not aware Gates was involvediin
the contract.

“I did all my dealings, with Steve,
Vance the council’s Music Commit-
tee chairman, and the University,”
Mills said. -

Students from Pitt, however, were
at the hall on Friday to setup for the
concert, she stated. All ticket
inquiries for "both concerts’ were

directed to the University and
National Record Mart by her office,
Mills added. ’

Brown was shown an ad appearing
in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette on
Friday, Oct. 13, which did not list
either the program council or Gates
as promoters of the concert. Brown
indicated he did not know why
Carnegie Music Hall personnel
would not pick up the absence of the
council’s name in the ad.

Josh‘ Baylson, Student Govern-.
ment Board president, was not

aware the hall» was rented for two

evenings. 4
“They told us (SGB) they rented
the hallfor one night only, ” he_said.
In addition Baylson stated that
.SGB’s deﬁnition of rental fees for

‘any event includes only the cost of

renting the hall itself. Brown

included payments for ushers,

security, insurance, safety permits,

AEL—-CIO Leader Directs Workers to f'Backi-'Iaherty *

' ’ By The Associated Press
PITTSBURGH - Organized labor
got theword yesterday to roll up its
sleeves and work for Democratic

Vtﬁubernatorial candidate Peter ‘ F.

Flaherty, who is trying to halt further
slippage in his popularity.

James Mahoney, executive vice
president of the political action arm
of the 1.5 million-member state
AFL-CIO, told a labor breakfast here
to get out the vote for Flaherty and
Democratic legislative candidates.

“He will win as sure as .I’m
standing here. If our people come
out, all the candidates here will
win,” Mahoney said in a ﬁery

 

speech after the crowd finished
bacon and eggs. .

-“We have to go back to_ the old
method ._.of ward and precinct
politics. We don’t win votes by tens
of thousands, or thousands. We win
votes by hundreds.” ’

The AFL-‘CIO executive commit-
tee has endorsed Flaherty, the
54-year-old former Pittsburgh
mayor. Thermammoth labor group
has donated’ $10,000 to Flaherty’s
war chest, which also includes a total
of $51,000 from the United
Steelworkers and the United Auto
Workers. '

Survey Seeks Answers
Traffic, Parking Congestion

By SUE McFARLAND
Pitt News Staff Writer-

Work on ‘a 10-month study
aiming to solve the parking, trafﬁc
congestion and public transporta-
tion problems plaguing Pitt com-
muters is nearing completion.

The study,’ -headed by Pitt
environmental engineer, Dr.
A.G.R. Bullen,icame as result ‘of
recommendations ‘of a community
advisory group, Oakland ‘Directions.
Inc. .
The cost of the survey, $50,000,
is being absorbed equally by the
University and the city of Pitts-

burgh. Both parties had money

allocated for the speciﬁcpurposes
of traffic studies and ‘agreed that it
would be more feasible to pool
these resources rather than ‘to
conduct separate studies.

The survey reveals that Oakland
is the largest and ‘most centralized
health and educational‘ center in
Western Pennsylvania‘, as well as a
major artery of transportation
andpublic services.

The study concentrates primarily
on transients‘, including ‘University
faculty, staff, students‘ and em-
ployees of ' local hospitals and

merchants‘. Thesegpeople are being

But’Flaherty, who still appeals to
the Vworking man, blasted his
Republican opponent, Richard L.
Thornburgh, for running a negative
campaign and being a political
novice.

“He had 25 ‘employees as U.S.
Attorney. Now he wants to- run state
government,” Flaherty said.

“The Republicans are pouring
millions and millions into this
election because they said, ‘This is

— and-from theirhomes and ‘means of _

transportation to Oakland.

A suggestion to continue an
existing‘bus lane ‘from the lower
part of Fifth Avenue through
Oakland ‘currently is under discus-
sion as a result of the survey.
According to Behers, this, along
with a proposed change in the
timing ‘of trafﬁc signals, is aimed at
eliminating some of the present
congestion‘ problems.

Behers reported that the ﬁnal
draft of the ﬁndings should be
available no later than Dec. 31, for
distribution to community-and
business-oriented groups,- as well
as to the city and University.

‘ An inventory of current ‘parking
spaces, parking costs, transit
service (stops, schedules and
routes) and the effects of traffic
lights" on ‘the control of both
‘pedestrian and motor trafﬁc is
included in the study. '
—According to Student Govern-
ment Board member Diane Behers,
who is working with Bullen on the

study, the subject of parking ‘is one "

that didn’t'need surveyed to realize

PLAINTALK

FROM ARMCO ON
 FINDING A JOB:   r

/

How the energy crisis chills your chances ,

Are you getting ready to look for the perfect job? More
power to you. Literally. You’ll need it. America is having
trouble finding the energy it takes to make you a job.

Led by American ingenuity, the world today works by
harnessing plenty of energy. Thank goodness. The alterna-
tive is human drudgery. Yet because our system is energy
intensive, a recent movement calls us wasteful. Our basic
approach to using energy is wrong, say these zealots. Big
is bad. Small is beautiful and the soft path (isolated, loca
energy systems——even individual ones) is what we need.

Could you really depend on a windmill to power your
hospital? How much steel could you make with a mirror
in your yard?

A curious combination of social reformers,-wilderness
fanatics and modern-day mystics has brought America's
energy development almost to its knees. They’ve-stalled
the nuclear approach and stymied coal. They’ve choked
down natural gas exploration and -xhamstrung oil. Their
love of exotic energy sources—sun, wind, geothermal and
tidal action——will last only until a few big
projects get underway. Then, chances are
they’ll find a way to turn them off, too. Our real
energy crisis is a crisis of common sense. ’

Our government seems to
actually encourage this madness.
Politicians entertain harebrained
schemes to tax this, ban that,
rig fuel prices and regulate their
use. We’ve strangled the market
system, the only approach that
can deliver as much of each kind
of fuel as people choose to buy.~

There’s a direct connection between
finding more energy and creating more jobs.
More of one makes more of the other.

By the end of this century. we’ll need 75%
more energy than were using today.

Right now, 93,000,000 American men and
women have jobs. Over the next ten years.

we’ll have to create another 17,000,000 jobs for more
Americans, including you. _

Plain talk about ENERGY "

We Americans already know how to solve the energy
crisis. We have the technology to reach solutions. Yet
each solution comes with its own set of political problems.
Natural gas mustn‘t cost too much. Offshore oil mustn’t
spoil our beaches. Coal mustn’t rape the land or poison
the air. The atom mustn’t threaten to destroy us. Energy
conservation mustn’t inconvenience people too much.

Fair enough. But so far, were paying more attention
to the problems than we are to the energy itself. We’ve
got to stop making every social goal an ideological crusade.
We need to think things through and make rational trade-
offs if we’re ever going to get those 17,000,000 new jobs.

Next time some energy zealot crusades for anything,
test the crusade against this question: Does it produce-

   
   
   

do a thing to help you get a job.

The National Weather Service has
predicted an unusually warm
winter, but that won’t stop ‘colds and
the ﬂu at Pitt,’ where the number of
cases reported to Bob LaCivita of
the _Student Health Services are
already “above and beyond nor-

LaCivita said the number of cases
reported so farthis year have been

. nowhere near epidemic propor-

tions, as they were last February,
when 200 to 300 persons visited th
health service daily. ». .

He said the weather won’t'greatly
decrease the number of illnesses,

because cold weather is not directly _'

responsible for /such increases.

_ LaCivita explained that people tend

to spend more time indoors and are
physically closer to one another in
the fall and winter. That proximity
causes the cold and ﬂu season, he
said.

“The fact that people are closer
together,” said LaCivita, “and that
they cough and sneeze next to each
other is what spreads colds.”

not to run to the doctor, because, at
first, he won’t give you a
prescription.

“First, take aspirin, it’s a mild
pain killer,” said LaCivita.- “Then
gargle and use throatlozenges. Try
antihistamines.
And lastly, get rest and drink ﬂuids.
The key is rest. If a cold~is coming
on, get plenty of rest.”

What to do if all this fails and
you’ve still got your cold? LaCivita
said that is when you should go to a

“After seven days then you can

"‘That’s usually when a doctor

’LaCivita warned against using
other people’s prescriptions.

“Doctors intend the whole
prescription to be taken. If the
symptoms go away, that doesn’t
mean you can stop taking the
medicine. So, if you takea few of

30 Congressmen Raise $1 .7 Mil Iionfoir Electio/ns"

By The Associated Press

WASHINGTON Thirty
members of Congress raised more
than $1.7 million and spent more
than $1 million defending their
seats even though they had no
opposition in either. the primary or
general election. V

Another 26 candidates who faced
minor opposition - they won with
more than 70 percent of the vote in
the‘ primary or faced only’ third-
party or write-in candidates in the
general election - raised nearly $1.7
million and spent ‘$1.4 million in
their races, according to the latest

Rizzo Denies Involvement in Transfer of Philly Priest   A   

By The Associated Press

PHILADELPHIA‘—Mayor Frank
Rizzo has denied any ‘involvement
in the transfer to Massachusetts of
a Roman Catholic priest who
publicly criticized him last month
for failing to build a new senior
citizens’ center.

A spokesman for the Archdiocese
of Philadelphia, which isgreques-'
ting the transfer, says “a public
confrontation on Oct. 4 between the
.Rev. Fritz Cerullo and the mayor
was one ‘reason for the transfer.
.The spokesman, the Rev. ,, Leo
McKenzie, said Cerullo allegedly
threatened the mayor with “using
his pulpit to denounce him.”

     

The figures show that running for
Congress can be an expensive
proposition, even when no one else
wants the job. ' 5

Rep. Edward R. Roybal, D-Calif.,
has said, “Ialways run scared, even
when I’m unopposed.” This
election, however, Roybal faces
opposition.

There is nothing ‘illegal about
such fund-raising -and, in fact, a
well-stocked campaign chest often

can aid a congressrnan’s bid for '

re-election by discouraging opposi-
tion. ‘ -
half ofthe campaign funds were
raised and almost half were spent in

But McKenzie added that
neither Rizzo not anyone in his
ofﬁce had requested the transfer.

Cerullo, however, accused Rizzo
of being responsible for the move.

‘‘I don’t mind accepting the
transfer in obedience,” he ‘said,
“but,I do object to being
transferred by the mayor of
Philadelphia rather than the

provincial of my order.”

4 Rizzo on Monday denied any
involvement in the action. ‘
“Believe me, I know nothing
about his transf'er,”"the mayor
said. “I knew he was having
trou~bles..,but it- would be abso-

lutely ridiculous for me to get"

involved in something like that.”

1978. Some of the funds were
received after the congressman
knew, or at least suspected, that
they might not be opposed for
re-election.

The 30 congressman include four
from Virginia, which selects its
general election candidates at a‘
convention of party delegates. The
four have no general election

Cerullo, 38, is an Augustinian

a long controversy within his order
and within the parish. Most priests
in Philadelphia are diocesan clergy

vote could make a difference, especially when it
~ comes to local issues‘and candidates. ,
“I wouldn't take the student vote seriously at all,”
said Nello Giorgetti, president of the College Young
Democrats at Pitt. “Politicians know students aren’t
going to vote and they know students aren’t a very
viable force.”
Witness the number of candidates who scheduled
speaking engagements at Pitt. U. S. Rep. William
Moorehead of Pittsburgh is running against
Republican Ted Jacobs. Neither candidate came to
P T ’ - Pitt. Flaherty “couldn’t fit it into his schedule,” ac-
' H ‘ cording ‘to Giorgetti. Thornburgh wasn’t able to fit

Young Republicans at Pitt, but “he realizes there
isn’t much of a vote‘ here.” U. S. Rep. Doug
Walgren did schedule a visit to Pitt, but more impor-
tant meetings forced him to cancel,at the last second.
It didn’t matter. There wasn’t much of a turnout
waiting for him. 2

‘ About the only candidate who did bother with Pitt
and other universities was Thornburgh’s running
mate, William Scranton III. He was active in politics
as a student and may be under the false impression
that today’s student has or wants a say in govern-
ment. ‘

The fact is that students can change. government’s
stingy policy toward higherieducation if they ban
(together. When the budget crisis hit state—related
universities last year a small group of students made
, numerous visits to Harrisburg to lobby for increased
/ funds. It was the first time students ever really at-
tempted a lobby in Harrisburg. Members of Pitt’s
student governmentand other student leaders made
frequent trips to the capital, and while many reasons
can be cited as to why the General Assembly granted
Pitt $63.1 million in aid, a four percent increase over
1977 (the first such increase in four years), the
legislators at least were aware that some students
cared enough to pay them a visit. '

It seems student interest in politics that was so im-
pressive in the 1968 elections faded in 1972 when
students were first allowed the vote in a presidential
election. Now, according to K. Leroy Irvis, state

' It was one ‘of those small town

football rivalries, and now, with the

hometeam taking their first loss of
the season and the underdogs
‘bound for the championship
playoffs, two of the winners broke
off from the line for the buses and
strode across the field to retrieve
the game ball.

“You can't take this football,”
said the referee. “Sir,” said the
linebacker,” you heard about one
of our players who got hurt last

week? Carl Stimac, he’s in -the‘

hospital. He's going to be operated
on tomorrow."
He paused, the ref nodded,

“This one’s forhim.”

“I’m sorry, son," said the ref. “I
didn’t ' know. ’ ’ 

The players scooped up the ball
and’ hurried to . rejoin their
teammates. '

I must explain myself. The
winners were my hometown team,
the linebacker is my brother. Carl
Stimac, my brother’s teammate, is
more than hurt: "he is paralyzed
from the neck down, the result of a

' football injury.

I Two Saturdays ago, Carl and an

opposing lineman butted helmets.

Carl‘s neck snapped. Only’ two
nerves remained intact. Twice at
the hospital, his breathing has
stopped; twice he has been
revived. His prognosis is not good,

operating ‘room for surgery twice
postponed.

I’ve read about the increasing
number of football injuries, and
show they’ are most often due to
faulty‘ equipment and illegal
techniques". I remember when
Sports Illustrated ran an entire,
series on the subject and I
remember the chill that went
through me as I read. Still, football
injuries had not‘ yet touched me.
My brother has had broken arms,
broken, legs. He keeps his
discarded casts in his room as a
reminder. Now,.I think he needs no
reminders. Neither do I, ‘neither\do

the families of the rest of his ’

teammates.

   

FIZANKS

There is that "usually-unspoken

statement ‘that one thinks of in‘
correlation with cases like Carl’s. It .

could have been my , brother. It
could have been any boy on the

‘team. And people connected to an

accident, as I am, feel guilty and
ashamed of their first impulse after
the initial shock. , A I - 
Butt Idigress. The important
thing is a 16-year-old boy who faces
life as a paraplegic. And ‘I ask why?
I think ‘it is more than Sports
Illustrated suggests — it is more

than the goal of violent victory by

coaches and ‘fans. We don’t:know
the exact cause of Carl's injury, but
it is more than likely it was a freak
accident. Just one of those things.

And that’s what is really chilling.’
It could have been my brother. So
very easily. The lack of protection
afforded by football equipment is
appalling, the absence of concern
by those in a position to prevent it
even more disgusting. Those killer
tactics, taught by coaches, taught
by even—Carl’s coach, my brother’s
coach, should never be permitted.
And yet, in these cases, one can
pinpoint the blame. You can say “if
only" and get a legitimate
response. For a ﬁ'eak accident, you
can’t. There is nothing to say, the
only reactions are ‘of fear and
shame.

 WASHINGTON - Six years and
.$74_ billion later,-. America's waters
_’are getting cleaner.

‘ It was in 1972 that Congress
passed the Clean Water Act, setting
-as a national goal making the
nation's rivers, lakes and streams
both ‘ ‘fishable’ and swimmable. ’ ’

Passage of the act triggered an
immediate assault on the scum,
‘garbage, human and industrial
*0 wastes and assorted filth\of
3;: civilization that turn clean water-
_ ways into open sewers.

' The‘ Environmental Protection
Agency estimates that governments
» . and industry have spent $74.3 billion
0 ,on. water pollution controls since
i 1973. Billions more will be spent in
 the next decade, and the toughest

“deliberate contact” with‘ the water
under threat of a $300 fine.

But the river is responding so well
to cleanup efforts that the chairman
of a ﬁve-state commission coordinat-
ing anti-pollution efforts proposed a
“swim-in” to dramatize the water's
new-found cleanliness. Ironically,
local police blocked‘ the swim-in,
citing the old ordinance.

EPA cites a_ long list of other
successes. Among ‘them are Pearl
Harbor, the Willamette River in
Oregon, the Androscoggin River in
Maine, Faiench Broad River in North
Carolina, the Houston Ship Channel
in Texas, Campbell Creek in Alaska,
Claumet River in Ilinois and Lake
Minnetonka in Minnesota.

“We have shown success and the
people want more, ’ ’ says Thomas C.
Jorling, EPA assistant administra-
tor for water and waste manage-
ment.

But future success is likely to come
more slowly, says Jorling. ‘
Most of the initial clean-up
efforts have related to sewage and
the construction of municipal and
industrial treatment plants that
purify the wastes before they are
discharged into ‘waterways.
Treatment technology focuses on

withdrawing the so-called oxygen-

demanding pollutants that smother
stream life.

Future clean-up efforts will focus
on toxic chemicals that to date have
suffered from “inadequate atten-
tion,” says Jorling. Although /the
chemicals sometimes enter the
waterways only in extremely small
amounts, some such’ as chloroform
and benzene are ;known' ;to.‘ cause
cancer in humans and laboratory

There also are the problems of
pollutants entering the water from
sources such as farms. Fertilizers
and pesticides applied to soil are

" carried by rainwater into nearby

waters.

Jorling also says EPA must focus
on major urban-industrial’ areas
where bacteria levels often are

hazardous, especially in streams ‘

where streamﬂows during the
summer often are inadequate to
dilute human or livestock waste-
loads. - ‘

The General Accounting Office,
the investigative armsof Congress,
estimates another $174 billion will
have to be spent by government and
industry by 1984 to achieve the
ﬁshable and swimmable goals

mandated by the Clean Water Act. .

It questioned whether the ex-
pense was justiﬁed.
' J orling, however, says there is no
sign the people are lesseningin
their support of pollution control
programs. .

California residents approved a
$375 million water pollution bond

" issue at the same time they enacted

the tax-restricting Proposition 13 , he
noted. '

“We don’t see any waning of the
people’s support in cleaning up the
nation's water," he declared.

In part, he says," the support
comes because “people can see
actual changes, in the quality of the
water.”

No one expects the nation to meet
the goal of making all waters
swimmable and ﬁshable by 1983.
But, Jorling. emphasizes, “there are
a lot of waters in the country that are
alifeady there,” waters that once
were polluted. ”

“' HARRISBURG — Independent
and third-party voter registrations
are climbing in Pennsylvania, and
the clout of the two major parties
remains about the same, according
to available state Election Bureau
ﬁgures.
The statistics, compiled for
Tuesday's gubernatorial election,

include data from 66 of 67 counties.
Registration ﬁgures from Philadel-

«phia County, the state’s largest, are

expected to be filed at least a week-
after the election.

_ Independent and third-party
t’-"’3'gistrations marked a 7 percent
gain since the May primary when
184,243 persons were in that
category, excluding Philadelphia
County ﬁgures’.

‘ “co .-I<.'!r~r~.. -«

\

This election’s registration,
which ended Oct. 10, showed that
199,699 persons in 66 counties
chose to list. themselves outside
both the Democratic or Republican‘
parties.

Though independent voters

"account for only about 4 percent of

the state’s registered electorate,
they are being actively wooed by
both major gubernatorial candid-
ates, each of whom expects a close
election. ‘

A Gallup Poll showed last week
that Democratic candidate Peter F.
Flaherty was four percentage points

’ ahead of Republican candidate

Richard L.‘ Thornburgh among
likely voters.

Thornburgh, banking heavily on
disillusioned Democrats and inde-

\

pendent voters who want a change
from Gov. Milton Shapp’s adminis-
tration, reportedly is encouraged by
independent voter increases.

“It definitely will help Thorn-
burgh, particularly with the difficul-
ties Flaherty is having now trying to
separate himself from the Democra-
tic party.” Thornburgh press
secretary Paul Critchlow said
yesterday by telephone.

“-Dick has proved he’s an
independent throughout the race. ”

Flaherty, who won his second
term as Pittsburgh mayor in 1973
with both Democratic and Republi-
can support, has sought an
independent image in the gubema-
torial race.

“‘Nobody likes Pete Flaherty but
the voters,” Flaherty said with a

5.

smile yesterday when asked about
numerous newspaper endorse-
ments that have gone to Thom-
burgh.

Democrats hold a majority of
registrations in the state, with about
51.4 percent so far. They had a 55.4
percent share in the May primary.

About 44.4 percent of the state’s
voters registered Republican for
this election so far, up from slightly
more than 40 percent in the
primary.

Just as in the primary, Republi-‘
can-registered counties will out-
number Democratic ones, 37-30.

In the state’s second largest
county, Allegheny, independent
and third-party registration jumped
10.4 percent since the primary,

' Wodno,sday",Novombor1,»_1978-;pjggg » 

when 28,530 voters were lumped/_
into__that category. ‘
For this election, 31,500 Alleg-

heny County voters registered with' ‘

either third parties or as indepen-
dents.- I ,
Philadelphia, with a record
204,849 new registered voters, is
expected to have a total of more
than a million eligible voters this
election. The expected high turnout
is attributed to the controversial
referendum on the city ballot, which

would allow Mayor Frank Rizzo to . '
” seek a third term. T

“We got 56,588 applications on I

Philadelphia County election chief ' I

Joseph Migatz, whose office is busy
investigating charges of voter fraud
in the city's 190 precincts.

‘Midnight Express’ Takes Off Via Good Act

/

By PATTY TASCARELLA

Pitt News Staff Writer

In 1970, Billy Hayes, a young American tourist attempted to smuggle

’ several bricks of hashish out of Turkey. He was caught trying to board a
New York-bound plane. and hauled off to a Turkish prison to serve a
four-year possession sentence. Just when the end of his term was
nearing, the courts inexplicably demanded a retrial on charges of

smuggling. Hayes was sentenced to 30 years in prison.

‘ ‘Midnight Express’ ’ is a prison term for escape; Billy Hayes caught it.
Upon his return to the states, Hayes wrote a book about his experiences.

Now,’ the book ‘is_ap ﬁlm, “The Midnight Express,” and it is a

compelling and terrifying account—not only because of the truth behind
the screenplay, but also because of the excellence of the actors.

Brad Davis, a young actor with a Warren Beatty proﬁle, plays Hayes
convincingly. .T he tension prior to Hayes’ arrest, the emotional reunion
between Hayes and his father, and Hayes‘ reaching out to fellow

’ prisoners for emotional support are well portrayed. _Davis is sentimental '
without being maudlin, terriﬁed but not melodramatic; his Hayes never

loses faith in himself.

Matching Davis’ strong peformance is Randy Quaid, a two-time Oscar
nominee who scores dramatically as the belligerent Jimmy Booth.
Booth is imprisoned for theft, and unlike’ Hayes is determined to break
out. Booth’s brawling actions make him suspect among the guards and
his attempts end in recapture and brutal beatings. r ' A _ W

drugged state. Hurt’s character is gentle and retiring but not without ' I

classmates, club members and
even convicts all qualify).

workings of families? By actually
living ‘with a variety of them from

feelings on their situations without

so vivid that the reader feels like

of humor, which helps alleviate
some of the downbeat passages.

frOverweight a Spreading ProbIemAmongStudents

I

Pitt News Staff Writer
Food is everywhere in Oakland. From restaurant

. row on Forbes Avenue to the vending machines in

almost every University building to the obligatory
popcorn popper in each dorm room, food is a univer-

sal presence. For most students, this campus-wide ,

cornucopia is merely a convenience. But for some, it
is a source of constant temptation that leads to one of
America's most pervasive health hazards—over-
weight.
The problem of overweight-—that is, being -more
than 10 percent above the ideal weight—affects
about 20 percent of Pitt students, according to
University dietician Barbara Gatti. These are the
students who may not appear noticeably heavy but
-who nevertheless have difficulty trying to reach and
maintain their ideal weight.
Physical problems connected with the extra
pounds may not be great at this point in the student's
’ life, but as the metabolism slows with age, the weight
becomes more difficult to shed and presents a threat
to health in the form of high blood pressure, heart
disease and a variety of other ills.
Overweight is not, however, a purely physical

illness, according to Dr. Joyce Alexander, a

' psychologist with the University Counseling Service.

“For some students, it is just-a matter of being on
campus, leading a sedentary life, eating fast food or
starchy cafeteria foods,” Alexander said. _

But for other students, food “replaces something
else that is missing in his or her life. That big fat per-

son is a protection—someone is hiding in there and)" "

psychological problem is removed,” Alexander said.‘

“But clearing up the psychological problem can be
overwhelming.” ' ’ ’

Although few students come to the counseling seré '

vice specifically because of their weight, Alexander
said about half of her patients are overweight. These
students complain of a variety of emotional ills, but
overweight emerges later, not as a major problem but
as a tangential one.

Among the most common emotional problems
that may lead to overeating is depression, according
to Alexander. Gatti said school pressures are a prime

cause of overweight in students" she sees, and Dr.-

Tom Schlesinger, another psychologist with ' the
counseling service, mentioned the culture shock of
coming to a big-city university as a contributing fac-
tor, producing stress that leads to overeating.’ I ' '
Alexander said the American obsession with thin-

ness also may lead students into psychological dif- A

ficulties. just as damaging as those that contribute to
overweight. She emphasized that overweight really is
not a problem unless the person is more than 25
pounds, too heavy. Below that limit, weight is more a
matter of appearance than of health, she said. I‘

“The difference between a size 6 and a size 12 is

'vanity,” Alexander said. “The, person who is _ob-'
sessed with being a size 6 is in many ways worse off .

than the complacent size 12 or size 13.”

Alexander, Gatti and Schlesinger all stressed that
the roots of overweight .are difficult for every
student, and only the student himself can make the
move to lose weight, regardless of the origin of his-
weight problem.

Importance of Penn State Game Obvious to Terps’ Claibame

, By The Associated Press

COLLEGE PARK, Md.-
Coach Jerry Claiborne of Maryland
says it’s belaboring the obvious to
comment on the importance of
Saturday’s game at Penn State,‘ a
clash matching two of the nation’s
four unbeaten major college teams.

 “The winner will take a big step

upgthe ladder toward the national
championship,” Claiborne said. “It
doesn’t take a Phi Beta Kappa to
ﬁgure that ou .”

Second-ranked Penn State has a
16- game winning streak, the longest
in the nation, and the 12- ga-me streak
of Maryland’s ﬁfth-ranked Terps is
the second longest.

‘ ‘One of our goals has always been
to have a team that can beat_the
top-ranked teams in the country,”
Claiborne said yesterday at his

'weekly ‘news conference. “It would

be abig boost to our program to beat
Penn State. ’ ’

But no one has to remind Maryland has had a shot at the top of

“We put ourselves in too many

In a game where the running

turned in subpar performances,
pointing the ﬁnger certainly would
not be difﬁcult.' ‘

“The worst thing we can have
them do at this point is to second
guess themselves,” said‘ assistant
coach Joe Moore. ‘ ‘Anything we’ do:
to make them doubt themseh/es is a
beneﬁt to Syracuse.”

‘The ' Panthers’, most glaring

included in the rushing statistics,
Pitt gained 43 yards in 20 attempts.

Many believe the move to one of
the bigger freshmen'running backs
is in order. Moore claims size has
nothing to do with the problem. i

‘ ‘The runners we have rightnow
are close to the same size as
Dorsett, Walker and Hutton,”
Moore said. “Judging someone’s
ability is nothing ‘more than an
opinion,‘and everyone is entitled to
their opinion. "Sure, I’d_ like to have
a big back; I’d like to- have a back‘
that is 6-11, weighs 375 pounds and
runs the 40-yard I dash in 4.5
seconds.” -

Sherrill was not so adamant about i
the starting backﬁeld remaining
in-tact...

“There might be some changes

‘made,” said Sherrill. “There is a

possibility a freshman running back

players will play this week. We're

If a ﬁrst-year player breaks into ‘

Bill Hurley, the Syracuse quarter-
back who spent ,_ two years
frustrating opposing defenses, will‘
spend Saturday afternoon watching
from the sidelines as his teammates
play Pitt’s 5-2 football Panthers.

A preseason All-America, Hurley
didn't, see much of the regular
season before three fractured ribs
punctured coach Frank‘ Maloney’s
Orangemen’s hopes for a competi-
tive season.

“We started out pretty well,”
Maloney said of his season opener
against ‘Florida State. “We were
marching down the ﬁeld pretty
effectively, but then Hurley got hurt
on the seventh play ofthe game.”

The Oran men, decimated and
demoralized, lost their ﬁrst four
games.’ Hurley’s return against
vW'est Virginia resulted in a 31-15
win for Syracuse but also aggrava-

back off the football ﬁeld indeﬁ-

“I thought if we had won‘the
Cotton Bowl -game in 1976 and
Pittsburgh had lost, we had a good
chance to be projected into the top
spot,” he said. But Pitt won the
Sugar Bowl game and Maryland lost
to Houston, or as Claiborne recalls:
“We kind of_ﬂubbed our dub.”

Maryland has allowed only eight
touchdowns in eight games, and just

three in the last ﬁve contests. But the"

Nittany Lions have rolled up .263
points with an explosive ‘offense

~. Maloney’s team,‘ so ‘far unsuc-
cessful with the young Tim Wilson
' taking the center snaps,-now claims
a 1-6 record and apparently is
headed nowhere. ‘

“We have weaknesses on the
team—that’s pretty darn obvious, ”
Maloney said. “We had some
conﬁdence problems, which hurt us
the most ofanything, but we’re
getting over them now. But when
you take out a great quarterback,
lose a trigger like Hurley, that's
pretty important." 6 ‘

Coach Jackie Sherrill, whose
Panthers are coming off ‘ ‘one of the
most frustrating losses (against
Navy) of my career,” isn't frothing
at the mouth, though.

“Syracuse is a team that always
plays very well against Pitt,”
Sherrill said.

What the Pitt _coach failed to
include, however, was that Hurley’s

arm has been responsible for much ,

of Pitt_’s problem in ‘containing

V’Syrac'use.' ‘ .

drop back 10 to 12 yards, .and their
big, strong line gives him a lot of _
time.

‘ “With -all that time, they can run ‘ .

’ deep with them, they go to screens

 

and passes to the backs ”

season. The Panthers needed a
heart-thumping defensive stand in
the fourth quarter to secure a 23-13
win.

Pitt needed to come from behind
three times last year, when Hurley
threw for 203 yards and again nearly
shocked a Pitt Stadium gathering.
The Panthers, who eventually
would end up in the Gator Bowl,
ﬁnally beat the 2-4 Orangemen,
28-21.

‘ ‘Hurley’s strongest qualities are
his ability to recognize defensive
coverages and his knack to get the
ball to the right receiver,” said
Maloney, who last year wasn’t quite
convinced of Hurley’s potential.

“He is definitely pro material,”
the coach yesterday said of Hurley,
who is faced with the option of a
redshirt. “One year ago today I
don’t know ifl would have thought
that, but the 'pro_"teams would be

Olympic Trials. ' M ,
“Six of last year’s All-Americans
no longer are competing, which
means the competition should be
‘spread more evenly,” Schuman
said. "‘It’s a pretty open event as far
as I'm concerned. It's probably the
most open one of them all as far as
qualifying standards are con- '

It’s~'- cerned.”

Panther coach Fred Louis believes
Schuman has _the potential to
become an All-America. _
4 “All he has to do isconcentrate on
hitting the walls faster on his starts
and turns, and he should have no_

problem making it.’’’ 0 .. .
Lewis likes having a swimmer like

Schuman on his team. ‘

A ‘ ‘The other teams know they can’t

beat him‘, so they swim around

him, ” the Panther coach explained.

“They have to adjust.” ~
Schuman considers himself, Stu

Swanson, who finished 15th in the _
100-yard backstroke at the NCAQF

championships, and long-distance
specialist Jeff Trew the best Panther
swimmers. '  ’
According to Schuman, strong

ﬁnishes by each should help Pitt
achieve its goal of ﬁnished among
the Top 20 teams in the nation.

ByKARENKADILAK
Pm News Staff Writer
Although four ‘games remain in
this season, Joe Gasparovic,
disappointed with his punting,
already is thinking about nextyear.
“I want to have a good spring
practice to get my average up,”

Gasparovic said. “It’s going to be if
awfully hard to bring my average up .

this season." 

“I went into the year thinking I
could average about 43 yards or so a
fnint,” the sophomore continued.
“So far, I haven’t been anywhere
near that.

‘ ‘I'm not so sure what my average
is now,” he added. “The last time I
checked (before the Florida State
game) it was something like 37
yards. Unless, I average about 50
yeards in the next few ‘games, I’m
not even going to average 40,for the

. season. '='

Having averaged 40.9 yards as a
freshman, Gasparovic only once
this season has averaged more than
40 yards in a game (41.0 against
Florida State). ‘ -

“I really don’t know what my

;oblem is,”
resident said. “I know a lot of
people are calling it some kindof
sophomore jinx or slump. Early in
the year, I_wasn’t kicking well. Then
I started kicking well in practice but
haven’t been kicking well in the
games. I ». . 3

“I think I’m overstriding ‘and
trying to kill the ball too much,” he
added. “I had the same problem
Saturday, so before my last two

to start doing something.’ Iwent out

By The Associated Press
Perhaps nothing characterized

' baseball's first two re-entry-drafts
' ‘ of star quality free agents as much
a as the skyrocketing salary ﬁgures

that accompanied each signing.
But that trend is likely to change
this year with the important
numbers involving length of
contract rather than dollars. That’s
because 'the players available in

, Friday's draft are mostly veterans

who are interested in security as

, they near the end of their productive
' baseball years.

Security _rneans
multi-year contracts. . _
Pitcher Tommy John's split with

the Los Angeles Dodgers is

characteristic of the trend.
John’s season-long debate with

 the National League champions
‘centered on length of contract. Af

age 35, he is seeking a three-year
_deal. The Dodgers balked at giving
him more‘ than two years. Vice
President Al Campanis’ argument
was that the club had paid John’
during a 1 1/ 2-year period when the

 ‘pitcher was recuperating from
‘ complicated arm surgery. ‘

To Replace 

  skyrocketing Salaries

   

Should the Dodgers’ loyalty to
John during that difﬁcult period of
his career have been considered
sufficient now, or did the ieft-hand-
er pay the club back with 47
victories over the last three seasons
following his recovery?

The same thing is happening
in Cincinnati, where Pete Rose rates
as the closest thing the town has to a
natural resource. But Rose will bi.

37 when the 1979 season begins and V 1

that’s dangerous territory for a
baseball player. So rather than
obligate themselves to a long-term,
expensive deal, the Reds apparent-
ly are content to accept his
departure to another team.

Boston faces the same situation
with pitcher Luis Tiant, who is listed
as 37*on the club’s roster but seems
to have been pitching forever. Even

.if his baseball age is accurate, it '
would be dangerous and Boston _

may not be anxious to compete for
hima in . the draft if it takes a
multi-year deal to keep himinthe
red sox. i ' ‘ = ~

Pitt Seeks Success  

(Continued from page 15)

. {Sherriil sees this as the key to all the
disappointments so far.
“We don't have an excellent ,
‘ ', ‘football team because we went

downhill offensively, ’ ’ said Sherrill.
‘ ‘The biggest thing we have to have

«right now is success, no matter who

is in there.”

“The talent is there,” said

,offensive guard Dan Fidlerv.
, “Things just aren't working out."
*There’s just one breakdown on

every piay.”
