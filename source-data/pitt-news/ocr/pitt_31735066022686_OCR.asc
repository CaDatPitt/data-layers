In what had triggered an intense
student and faculty protest within
the Fine Arts Department and the
Architectural Studies program,
Jones received a letter March 15
from Jerome L. Rosenberg, vice

A provost and clean of the Faculty of

Arts and Sciences, stating that
Jones’ contract would be ter-

renewal this August.

In a phone call yesterday after-
noon to the Pitt News, dean of the

College of Arts and Sciences, Irwin 

J. Schulman revealed that
Rosenberg’s decision to terminate
Jones’ contract ‘had been reversed,
and that Jones would retain the
position of director of the program

It was a “general reconsidera-

“I would say it came from a re-

Job

Jones is happy that the termina-
tion of his contract has been revers-
ed, but added that “there are still a
lot of "questions to be answered.”

Jones’ primary fear is in the
“continuity of the program,” in ad-
dition to staffing problems he is
currently having. Jones said he
wouldn’t want the program to con-
tinue with him if he had to en-
counter the same difficulties every

- time his contract was up for
renewal.

The reversal of the decision to
terminate Jones’ contract was due
to “compound of sources,” accor-
ding to Jones. He cited student in-
put and the fine arts faculty taking
an interest in the issue.

Jones came to Pitt as a private

at Legislators To PGR: No i8 Percent Fund ‘ Hike For Pitt

By MARY KANE
I Pitt News Staff «Writer
Pitt will get nowhere near the 18
percent increase in state appropria-
tions -it wants,_ according to
legislators who talkedto Public and
Governmental Relations lobbyists
in Harrisburg Wednesday.

PGR executive director Lisa Ep-
peheimer said Governor Thorn-
burgh has recommended an in-
crease of only 5.2 percent _for Pitt.

“We think this is low,” Ep-
peheimer said. She added that PGR
lobbyists went to Harrisburg “... to
find out how representatives feel

about appropriations in general,-:

higher education and how receptive
they are to an increase.”

The lobbyists were concentrating '
on members of the appropriations
committee, and legislators from
Allegheny County, said Ep-
peheimer. ‘

. Rep. Walter Deverter, a_member .

- of the House Appropriations Com-

mittee, said Pitt will probably get

‘close to what the governor recom- I,
mended.

“-There’ just isn’t themoney” for
‘higher appropriations, Deverter

' said.
“Many people view money for r

‘higher education as a handout,”

Deverter said. “Many people say,
‘Let kids pay for their own educa-
tion’.” A
Universities have branched" out
into other curriculum for which
they have no preparation,” and all
institutions can operate much better
than they have, Deverter added.

- According to Deverter, some of ,
the greatestmen have had no col-
lege education. He said that
students: need work experience, and
that the military can supply on the
job experience for young people.

“I agree with Carter that women
' and men should be drafted into the

military to get experience in the
field,” he said. ‘ V '
Lobbyist Chip Roth reported that

McClatch told him that if Pitt gets
more than Thornburgh recom-
mended, it would only be slightly
Roth said McClatch'.didn’t
think Pitt would get as much as

chairperson of the Department of
Fine ‘Arts, now a professor in the

. mittee.

According to Jones, when these
contributors left or went to other
positions in the university, there
was a breakdown in communica-
tion. V

. “Bob Marshal and David Powers
were committed to interdisciplinary

Vi. ' studies, and were some of the ‘few
--"highly placed administrators who

advocated interdisciplinary
studies,” Jones said.

“When they were gone, their in-
fluence was missed and, apparently,
the people who replaced them are
not committed to interdisciplinary
stpdies,” Jones said. '

‘The program has generated a
number of new'c,ourses within_ the
university, and has registered
twenty;six architectural studies ma-
of which will be
graduating this year. The growth of
the program indicates an “interest

and a stability or soundness” to it,

according to Jones.

but an interdisciplinary course of
study. _

—That Doug Jones remain as

_ director of the program, as he is the ‘

PITTNJE

only qualiﬁed person whose name
has been associated with it.-

The students were informed last
Friday,. March 21, from Jones that
his contract was not going to be
renewed, and on Monday, March
20, a ‘memo sent to the advising
department from the head of the
advising department, Fred Koloc
had stated that there would be a
new director of the program, Pro-
fessor Franklin T oker, a faculty
member from Carnegi-Mellon
University. . .

Toker is presently an associate
professor of architecture at
Carnegie-Mellon University’s
school of architecture, where he
claims architecture has been the
center of his studies as an art
historian since 1964. Toker em-
phasized that he is not a profes-
sional architect.

Foley expressed anger in the pro-
posal to replace Jones with Toker,
“a medievalist with little experience
in twenthieth century architecture”.
Foley substantiated his claim by
referring to the fact that he had
gone to Carnegie-Mel1on.’s library
where he reviewed a number of
works that Toker had published. 1

“Doug Jones is a modernist in

addition to beinglra professional ar-

chitect, and he is ully aware of con-
temporary thought. At this point in
time, these are the key issues that
have to be taught,” Foley said.
1 Before Jones’ learned . that his
contract had been renewed, he had
said that changing directors at this
point in time wouldhave been a
“serious problem”. »/
" “We’re at the point of trying to.

refine the program and to change to
a medievalist will destroy the pro-
gram,” Jones said.

Jones referred -to‘ Toker as a
“disciplinarian,” as opposed to an

a “premature,”

“interdisciplinarian” with no abili-
ty to integrate design education and
learning into cognate areas.

The architectural students met
with Dean Rosenberg on Wednes-
day to voice their anger over the ter-
mination of Jones’ contract.

According to Foley, the outcome
of the decision to renew Jones’ con-
tract may have been inﬂuenced by
this Wednesday.

Rosenberg stressed at the meeting
that the problem w_as “financial
and not related to the Architectural
Studies Program. .

“We have had to make some ve
hard decisions on how to achieve a
balance of budget; it’s a painful
decision but the university does
have a committment to programs,”
Rosenberg said.

Rosenberg said he ‘was
“mindful” that Jones was a “good
organizer,” but he went on to say
“such people are lower in priority
than tenured faculty”.

Rosenberg called the reference to
Tokeras the new candidate to" head
the architectural program
only ‘commenting
that they were “considering his ap-
pointment to the faculty”.

“‘I’m sorry this word got out
before he was appointed,”
Rosenberg said.

Rosenberg then went on to say
that Dean of the College of Arts
and Sciences, Irwin J. Schulman,

was mounting’ a formal review of .

the program. Schulman had
already spoken with one “outside
consultant,” in addition to a com-
mittee appointed to review the pro-
gram, according to Rosenberg.
Jones revealed later that the out-
side consultant, Kent" Blumer, who
was to lecture at Carnegie-Mellon.

‘on Maich 19, was contacted by

Schulman and told that the review

meeting was cancelled. Jones
reported seeing Blumer that even-
ing; »
Jones said that he was told by
Schulman on March 17 that “he
doubted he would go ahead with
the review,” and that Schulman’s
rationale behind the decision not to
continue with the review was “if
there’s no director of the program,
then there’s no sense in going ahead
with the review committee.”

Jones had also prepared a 100
page report for the review commit-
tee dated March, 1980.. But in talk-

-ing with the four member CAS

review committee, Jones said he is

positive that only one member of .

the committee, John Williams of
the Fine Arts department, had
received a copy, and that theotlter

Peter Machamer, and Ray Owen
had not received copies of the
report or had not read them.

»In a meeting between Foley,

another architectural student Pam .

Shaw, and a member of the Pitt
News,’ and I Schulman, Schulman
said that it was “a personal decision
not to form the committee.”
“After talking informally to the
faculty, there seemed no future of
the termination of Doug Jones’
contract. ' In‘ the fall, I was

swamped with many "other things. I‘

made a personal decision not ttr
form the committee; maybe it was a
mistake,” Schulman said.

Rosenberg pointed out the fact

Two   Pill Debate Teams   QuoIifyl=or Noiionolss

By CINDY COHEN
Pitt News Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh’s
William Pitt Debate Union has
qualified two teams for the Na-
tional Debate Tournament to be
held at the University of Arizona,

April 17-21. -
Steve Marzen and Mark Reed
received an at-large bid to nationals
which allowed them to attend
automatically, and Mark Wayda
and David Frederick competed at
the District- 7 Tournament and came
in second place to capture one of

He participated inthigh school, go-
ing to nationals three times and,
since the pojnt gap between
Frederick and the next person on
the list is so great, it is unlikely that
his record will be broken for quite
some time. '

Along with a lot of hard work,
the debaters get a chance to travel
nationwide and meet people from
other schools. Mark Reed, a junior
from Chander, Arizona said,
“Depending on my class load, I
spend about 20 hours a week on
debate but I get a lot more out of it.
It helps me in my classes, speaking
in front of large groups of people "
and in,.ewriting papers.. Since I
started debating, my general
knowledge. has increased
phenomenally, we’ve researched
issues that are very relevant, like the

pros and cons of nuclear power.”
Mark Wayda came to Pitt to

debate after talking to_'former Pitt
debaters’ from his highschool in

Cleveland, Ohio.  L -
“I guess the most important part

of debate is the peopleyou meet. It

chance to learn a discipline, the
same as an athlete, anytime that
you commit yourself to something
to that extent, that’s a good thing.”
' Frederick also commented on the
relevance of debate to all '0
his teammates. ‘

The four debaters have a total of
24 years of forensic experience bet-
ween them. This includes participa-
tion in high school, activities such
as debate, and individual events also gives me themotivation to do a
such as oratory, drama and extem- lot of reading. I’ve gained a lot of

' simple phrase that evokes so much

emotion—yet, it barely touches
upon the efforts‘ of over 800 Pitt
student volunteers who will be
working with exceptional children
from the Greater Pittsburgh area on
March 29 from 11:00 a.m. to 4:00
p.m. in Forbes Quadrangle.

The Hand-in-Hand festival pro-
vides a day of recreation for emo-
_tionally, physically, and mentally
handicapped children, noted
chairperson for volunteers, Mary

‘Beth Deering. This festival, in its

second year at Pitt, is one of the few
of its kind in western Pennsylvania,
said Deering. Approximately 400
children from area institutions, the
Home for Crippled Children,
Eastern Seals, and‘ individual

, children and parents are expected to

attend.”

Since the first week in October,
Hand-in-Hand committees have
been working to plan a day'full of
activity and entertainment for the
children attending, said Deering.

Both the number of exceptional_
children and student volunteers has
doubled this year, according to
Deering. Student groups
represented include: .Lambda
Sigma, the schools of Pharmacy
and Physical Therapy, various
fraternities and sororities, and a

_ large commuter group. About half
.— of the volunteers will work “orre on

one” with an exceptional child,
noted Deering, while the others will '
run booths, games, and perfor-
mances to entertain thechildren.
“One on One” volunteers have
the responsibility of remaining with
a child guest for the duration of the
festival, according to Deering.

Preparation for the festival was

In fact, Deering said that almost

‘Beautiful Hands’: Increasing Awareness Of Deaf's Plight

A group of six students will be

This “sign fest” is an attempt to

Franzi contended that director of

Under The I
Influence

NEW YORK—An advertisement
in the New England Journal of
Medicine for the tranquilizer
Librium shows a pair of elderly
gentlemen playing chess, and claims
the drug “rarely affects mental
acuity at recommended doses.”

But a recent letter to the editor
disagreed.

“It is with regret thatl comment
that the positions of the black
knight and bishop and the fact that
the man facing us missed one move
in the opening game strongly sug-
gest the opposite,” said Dr. Leslie
Iffy of the New Jersey‘ College of
Medicine and Dentistry.

Al Zobel, director
munications for Hoffman-La
Roche Inc., maker of Librium, said

of com- .

he saw the letter, “but I must con-
fess I don’t play enough chess to
know,whether he is right.”

“We are studying our next
move,” Zobel said.

department had still been interested
in getting someone to fill the posi-
tion ‘of an Americanist, which had
been vacated last term by Professor
Gardner. I

“As far as I know, Dou Jones
didn"t apply for the position,”
Rosenberg said.

“There is no existing position in
the university that could reasonably
fill the position of an architect or
architectural studies teacher,”

4 Jones said.

“There is no discipline in the
university that is going to be excited
at giving up a ‘position to an ar-
chitectural studies teacher,” Jones
added. '

Jones also said that the matter of
the Americanist position in the Fine
Arts department had‘ not been
discussed with anyone in the Fine
Arts faculty, and that “they never
intended to give up that position to
an architectural studies teacher.

“What has happened is a new
program has been designed that re-
quires a new faculty position in a

university which is having financial
problems,” Jones said.

Schulman said he didn’t think
there was “anything stopping”
Jones from finding a position.

“Realistically, I don’t know of
any department that would‘ hire
him,” Schulman said. “He’s not
an ‘Arts and Sciences faculty in the

- sense that he’s a professional ar-

chitect. We don’t hire lawyers or
businessmen, either.”

In a recent development, it was
discovered Wednesday morning by
the architectural students in a
memo sent to the advising depart-
ment that Schulman had switched a
course in the ASP.

The “Interdisciplinary Semi-
nar,” a required course for gradua-

tion with the architectural major,

strategically placed in the fall so it
can beiused for graduate applica-
tions, was cancelled by Schulman._

. The course was replaced with

I ,

I
/

    ASK  

“Introduction to Architectural
Studies,” whichais the first course
taken after a student declares a ma-
jor in the Architectural Program.
The course is‘ presently being of-
fered this-term.

Jones said that he was not in-
formed that his courses were to be
changed, and that it was a decision
Schulman made without advising
the program adviser committee.

“He has no business changing‘ it

_ as far as I can see,” Jones said. “It

seems irregular to teach another in-
troductory course that we are
presently teachingthis winter. To
offer the introductory course ‘again
is irresponsible,” Jones said.

In the meeting on Wednesday,
_Schulman said the decision was
~made because of “time
constraints”. '

“I can’t proceed legally without
advising the committee, but it was a
judgment in the best interest of the
students,” Schulman said.

There ctirrently is a proposal on the desk of the.
vice chancellor for student affairs that if passed,
may eventually destroy freedom of the press at

stipulation that the chief officer of each» stud-ent
media group will no longer be elected internally".

appoint and remove, if necessary, the chief of-

‘ ficers because elections end up to be popularity

contests, according to Director of Student Ac-
tivities, Andy Smith. These popularity contests,

’ [ Instead, the Media and Publications Board will ,  I

according to Smith, cause a poor working at-
mosphere.for the individual organization.
Smith’s. reasoning is ludicrous because elections
of these officers will be in the hands of individuals
who, for the most part, have little or no

‘V knowledge of the workings of each Organization.

How, then, will the board elect an officer without
actually working with the candidate at the
organizational level? _ T ,

The situation becomes more complicated when
one "considers that the Media and Publications
Board, under the proposal, will be under" the
auspices of the director of student activities.

Both the vice chancellor for student affairs and
the director (who has been delegated the authority
to supervise the campus media by the vice
chancellor) constitute the greatest threat to each
organizat\1on’s editorial freedom and individual
autonomy.

Earlier this week, Smith said that under the ‘

revised constitution, he would have the power to
veto any decision by the board related issues.

This clause gives the director of student. ac-
tivities virtual dictatorial power over the Media
and Publications Board. If the director does not
like one ‘Of the board’s decisions, he can easily
veto it. ’ E‘ I

As for the vice chancellor for student affairs, he
has the power to approve amendments to the pro-
posed constitution or, if he chooses, to strike
down amendments that do not meet his approval.
Also the vice chancellor may suggest and imple-
ment his Own amendments to the proposed con-
stitution. _

Even the provisions in the proposed constitu-
tion detailing the make-up Of the board itself give
the vice chancellor and the director of student ac-
tivities inordinate amounts Of power.

According to the proposal, the board will con-
sist Of eleven members selected by various means.

Friday, March 28, 1980—Page 6

The board appointment process gives both the
director of student affairs even more power over
the campus media. Not only do they‘ have veto

— -power over the board, they also have excessive in-

put in choosing the board’s membership.

The Board itself, according to the proposed
constitution, will have the authority to “approve
the Statement Of Purpose, Constitution, Bylaws
and editorial policies_” of all the student media
and publications. .

This provision is perhaps the most ominous 09”

all. . -
It takes away the freedom of the media
organizations through its power to approve
editorial policy and organizational structure. In
addition, a higher authority (i.e. the director of
student activities Or the vice chancellor for student
affairs) has the power to veto decisions /by the
board. Thus, an individual media organization
has little control of its own destiny. I
There are other stipulations in the proposed
constitution that are equally unjust to Pitt’s stu-

. dent media but are too nume’rous to state here.

If the proposed constitution is approved, the
basic premise that our nation’s ,press is founded on
-will be destroyed at this university. I I

The role of the press is to serve as a watchdog of
government and the peoples’ advocate. At Pitt,

The Pitt News is responsible for reporting on the ’

university gOvernment—the administration.

How then will the editors of The Pitt News
report on the administration’s activities if the
member of that administration control The Pitt
News through the Media and Publications Board?

If the Washington Post or the New York Times
was controlled financially and editOrially'by the
United States government, this nation wouldbe in

‘ serious trouble. ~

Similarly, the University of Pittsburgh—its
students, faculty and'staff—would suffer if the
campus media is controlled by the administration.

According to the proposed ‘constitution,’ the

We urge Pitt students, faculty,,and staff to re-
quest a copy of the proposed constitution from the
office of student activities and voice their opinion
on the document. Public discussion Of this issue is

‘fundamental rights—freedOm of speech and

.1 was interested to note the plan
for student media being submitted
by Mr. Andy Smith, which would
put control of the student media in

the hands of a small group of peo— »

ple, many of whom would be
responsible only to the vice
chancellor for student affairs. This
part of the group would consist of
the outsider individuals and the stu-
dent media advisor. What bothers
me more than this is that this group
would have the right to censor Or
remove the editors of the student

-"Zfnedia.

Mr. Smith claims this would lead
to a much more objective manage-
ment of the media. It is with this
point that I would dissent. When,
in the history of many,‘ has an
oligarchy been more objective than
deomocratically elected leaders. I
do not believe that the Achrons of
Athens were regarded as more ob-
jective than democratically elected
leaders by the citizens of Athens. A
media oligarchy cannot be seen to

be consistent withthe goals of a free .

marketplace of ideas, which is a
necessity for the survival of a
democracy.

The clear and present danger that l
I see.here is that if an editor-

published an article which was not

pleasing to theadministration, then —

-this group, beholding largely to the
administration, might try and
remove him/her.

United States has this power.

What gives me an even greater
chill through the spine is what it
tells us about those who run Stu-
dent Affairs. For the past several
months I have observed a_ trend
towards the restriction of student
actions. First the dorm ‘policy
change and now this, the next thing
one might expect to see is the scrap-
ping of all student rights," and end
to free speech and assembly. This
trend, this impulse, must be
reisisted with all possible effort.

In order for, an academic institu-
tion to survive, students must be
allowed to develop resonsibility.

This does not come from the restric- ..

tion of choice, but through freedom
of choice. This is the inheritance of
Mill, Jefferson and the other
democratic theorists. Mr. Smith's

notion of government seems to Owe

more to Plato’s Republic. How-
ever, I do not see any philosopher
among his kings. ‘

Displeased
With By-l.Ows

_ As Secretary of the Student
Commuters Affairs
Committee, I want to voice tlie
committee’s extreme displeasure
with the new Student Government
By-Laws which were passed at the

last Student Government Board‘

(SGB) meeting. We are particularly
distressed with the provision which
calls for the appointment by the
SGB of chairmen of all standing
committees. _

Until now, all committee officers
were , elected by committee
members. The new selection pro-
cess calls for an ad hoc committee
to seek candidates for the chair-
manship Of each standing commit-

tee; their recommendations would ’

later be‘ approved by the SGB.
We consider this new system
much more

example of

This would be I
censorship of the most foul nature. -
Not even the Congress of the_

involved than is.
necessary for the task. It is another
government

bureaucracy breeding more‘

bureaucracy.

We further believe that this will
hinder the progress of standing
committees. Any organiza-
tion operates best when lead by a
person who has the electoral man-
date of the Organization’s members.

We also must question the
legitimacy of these new By-Laws.
Neither standing committee
members, not any other student
seems to have been made aware of
the’ By-Laws’ provisions untilthe
SGB vote occurred. As we under-
stand, some SGB members did not

even see the By-Laws until the mo-
ment they were asked to vote on
them. If our elected representatives
did not formulate these new By-
Laws, then who did?

We believe something has gone
wrong with the democratic process
of our student government. NO
other elected body in this nation
would have dared make such drastic
constitutional changes without first
seeking input from the governed.

We challenge the Student
Government board to present these

new By-Laws at a Public Hearing

Mr. Evans introduces his
arguments by ‘stating that he has

”‘founded on a grossly bad grasp of
political science. . . ’ ’ We now know
that we are getting it from an ex-

This‘ sounds like something
Bismark would agree with—and
certainly Bismark was an expert
also—-after having lead the way to
the First World War! In myown
humble’ opinion, however, I don’t
see the logic of implying that we
need a draft because other nations
have one. I will argue that it -is this
nations task to lead the way to
peace rather than follow the path of
war.

Mr. Evans second argument ap-

from an expert political scientist.
he is arguing against the myth that

The nations that did get in early
had a few million more dead added

back up theargument for a stan-

and Switzerland as examples of na-
tions with standing armies that
“have not had a war in 150 years.”

The. fortunate fact is that no ag-

Douglas MacArthur, himself,
directly disobeyed President
Truman, and crossed the Yalo
River to take the war to the enemy.
This singular action brought over
300,000 screaming Chinese troops
down on the advancing American
Army and routed them to the man!
The sorry fact is that we had no
business in either country except
that the US Army got big and’
powerful during WWII. _The
generals in the pentagon know that
without a war [as Mr. Evans
pointed out] our “Anglo-American
dislike of a standing army” would
reduce the army to something less
than our largest single investment!
Mr. Evans proceeded to attack
the ,economic argument which I
outlined last week. He proclaims

.that “The stoppage of Mid-East oil 1

‘would not only mean giving up
one’s Sunday Drive, but probably
your financial aid and your job at
the end of college‘.”«He suggests
that we need an army to keep the
Russians from turning off the tap
because the “miscues ‘of the current
administration - .. demonstrate ,
diplomatic efforts backed by un-
preparedness and military vacilta-
tion are bound to fail.” I-object to
this kind of fallacious thinking be-
ing passed off as political science to
the 19-20-years-olds who have to
make a life and death decision.
Consider this: Mr. Evans is using
scare tactics to stampede us to a
draft. He is arguing that’ the future
is dark—full of unemployment and
failure for our administration in the
Mid-East_ diplomatic problem.
Sounds more like a foggy crystal
ball than political science. One fact
we need to understand is that Iran
just went through a political revolu-
tion that threw out a despot and in-
stituted democracy. We don’t like
that because we"had our revolution
200 years ago and last year we own-
ed their despot. Secondly, the Ira-

nian government, elected by the Ira- _

nian people, has warned Russia to
stay away and, in fact, to get out of
Afghanistan. Thirdly, a few
militants are holding the American
hostages because they want.-the
Shah—not because they want trou-
ble with America—they just want
the Shah. But they won’t get the
Shah. The Shah still belongs to the
American Military Industrial
establishment (with Kissinger and
Rockefeller as_ spokesmen) and he
will be in our hospitals and under
our guard till he dies.

So what can President Carter do?

- 2

He has to wait for the Iranian
government to get control of the
situation, and then, negotiate. ls
President Carter bound to fail as
Mr. Evans predicts? Should we get
the draft ready now for the failure
ahead? What failure? Not one
American has been harmed. The oil
has stopped because Iran has just
had a revolution and life has yet to
return to “normal. Russia had its
hands more than full with a’ grow-
ing Moslem resistance both inside
and outside her borders.‘-In addi-
tion, Marshall Tito is getting ready
to die: Russia has another potential
trouble spot ready to break loose. I

, further suggest that recent history
» has demonstrated that most East

European countries would be happy
to break with Russia if the time
were right. That union is held
together by might, haterand fear
and will break up in its own time.

on the Draft Reflected By Writer

Yes, Russia has a massive army.
Are they defensive troops askes Mr.
Evans? Yes they are. If Russia
weakened many of the satellite
countries, would break for in-
dependence and that means internal
war. Russia has built a defensive
fortress of nations.

There are many considerations to
be reviewed before one should vote
for a draft. If Mr. Evans’
arguments in any way represent the
affirmative, I am confident that this
kind of empty, political, old war-
rior thinking will die with the com-
ing election or the return of the
hostages.

One final note. As I listen to
these advocates for a draft I can’t
help but wonder why they are still
civilians-it’s‘still a volunteer army

“They are both deﬁnitely threats to
us because they are both improving

because we didn’t beat them in our

junior, however, made a sparkling
comeback in the Eastern Wrestling

second place finish at 150 pounds,
found himself going to the
NCAA’s. '

Although _ Pitt assistant coach‘

Chuck, Cor.-yea ‘ admitted that it
would be unrealistic to expect Bond
to achieve all-America status, by
placing in the top eight at 150, he
agreed that Bond had the ability to
make a go at it.‘ Indeed, just his
presence in Oregon meant there was

only one game against Penn State
all season long. In the ECV/L open
tournament played last month, Pitt
was the only team to defeat Penn‘

competition. Since then, though,
the Panthers have not been so for-

the injury, Bond continued to wres-

defaulted in fear of more seriously
hurting the shoulder. In essence,
Solario’s one blow had quickly end-

_ Ass’t Sports Editor
Babbie Flock and Pitt seemed to
have been made for each other. The.
freshman gymnast from Belle Ver-
non, Pa. was recruited by many
other schools. The list is too long to
even consider. But when it was all
said and done, she chose Pitt.
“I’ve always wanted to be here.
An old coach introduced me to
Pitt’s coach and then they recruited
Pitt is the ultimate,” said
Flock.

,/an

Q‘ Babbie’s career started modestly

about ten years ago when a friend
aroused her interest in the sport.
Flock began ‘competing with B.G.’s
School of Gymnastics, a local
organization for young gymnasts.
While with B.G’s, she competed im
the Mid-Atlantic Gymnastics
Championships for two years and
won in the balance beam and vault
events both times.

Competing with B.G.’s turned .

out to be very beneficial, for Flock,
since the program for gymnastics
was cut out of her high school’s

budget. . .

“Ihad only one opportunity dur
ing high school to compete on the
team because
freshman year, the program was cut
due to a lack of money,” Flock
said.

During those three yearswithout
high school competition, . Flock
competed in many gymnastics
events sponsored by other organiza-
tions as well as with B.G.’s Her
name became widely known to col-
lege coaches due to her skill and

success, even without the help of a _

high‘ school team.

This season at Pitt has had its ups
and downs for Flock as well as for
the entire team.

“A moment that sticks out for

this year was the Pitt Invitational
Tournament.‘ It was my first meet
in college and I placed third all-
around,” said Flock.

“The balance beam has been my
best event all year long. I feel that
all-around, however, I could have
done a lot better,” she said.

Although only a freshman, she is
considering a major in the new
business program. If not, she plans
to stay in CAS and see what comes_
along. ‘ ‘

As for a future in gymnastics,
“After I finish here, I might
become a private coach for a gym-
nastics club or maybe try judging,”
Flock said.

Next year’s team is expected to be
improved over this year’s version.

As Flock said, “We’ll have a’
much better team. I think we’ve
learned from our mistakes and we’ll
be able to keep on improving.”

The team works very hard on im-
provement with three hours 1 of
workouts six days a week. There
are set routines which include work
on the bars and beam, followed by
tumbling. , '

“The biggest meets this year for \

me were the Penn State meet and
Easterns. I did well at Penn State as
did the team, but that was early in
the year and we needed a lot of
work for the rest of the season,”
Flock said. I

“As for Easterns, we could have

done better there. ‘ I was kind of
disappointed that I didn’t do as well
as I expected,” she said. .

' Pitt’s women gymnasts will be
stronger and next year’s Easterns
may provide a different story.

SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.—Major
league baseball owners “have ad-
mitted to me that they don’t see any
way to control each other,” so they
are seeking the support of the

A players’ union to help keep salaries

and costs down, the director of the

see no reason why the season should
not open on schedule—April
9-—even if an agreement were not \

, reached.

The players, though, fear that if
they perform without a contract,
the owners could declare an impasse
and invalidate the old agreement

Miller said he is concerned about
the image of the players’ union
since many fans find it hard to
believe that players would dareto
strike in light of the huge salaries
many receive.

“Don’t the players have
enough?” Miller said he has been

asked. He responds with the ques-
tion, “Don’t you realize we’ve just

met for 19 weeks on owners’ not

As for the huge salaries, he said,
“They were not negotiated by the
Players Association; they were
negotiated individually. And ex-
cept for an occasional error, an ex-
erienced businessman never pays

A meeting of player represen-‘

recessing the bargaining until Sun-

A A talks that were to have been con-
' .ducted on Friday.
The Federal Mediation and Con-

quest, agreed Thursday to mediate
the Sunday session which will be
held in Palm ‘Springs, Calif., said
‘Kennedy E. Moffett, deputy direc-
‘+- ’ H tor of the service.
Miller said the talks so far have
in been stalled by owners’ demands
that should not even be on the
table. A -.

.‘‘They came in with a demand
that no player can be offered more
than a one-year contract if he has
less than five years service,” Miller
said. “They don’t have to offer
more than that now. They want us

sibility.”

Miller said it is for a similar
reason that owners are seeking a

* The owners, he said, want to

“change free agency to a trade. The

‘ free agent in some circumstances
could not be signed by a club unless
that club gives up a regular.”

Such a change would “break the
back‘of the free agency system, and
the savings to the owners would be
in the tens of millions of dollars,”
Miller said.

By The Associated Press

-_.»~, PHILADELPHIA--Take a look-

at the Philadelphia Phillies’ roster
and you almost have to conclude
that nobody can beat this team over
a 162-game haul.

The Phillies, however, are a

perfect example of that old bromide

that you can't tell a book by its

cover.

Manager Dallas Green has more
ifs than a guy reading a racing
form.

The Phillies’ first eight look
solid. Barringinjury the starting in-
ﬁeld of catcher Bob Boone, first

,baseman Pete Rose, second
‘baseman Manny Trillo, shortstop
Larry Bowa and third baseman
Mike Schmidt, and an outfield of
Greg Luzinski, Garry Maddox and
Bake McBride appear» as good as
any in baseball.

Boone is the only suspect in the
group. He’s coming off knee
surgery, didn’t play in the first half
of the spring training schedule, and
although he claims he can; do
everything, he’s still not 100 per-
cent. Boone is even more important
in that his backup is rookie Keith
Moreland, a great prospect, but
nonetheless a rookie.

.And Green insists he planned to
carry only two catchers. Tim Mc-

‘ Carver was forced into retirement,

one way or another.

The Phillies, after winning three
consecutive National League East
titles, slumped to fourth last year,
promting the firing of manager
Danny Ozark with 30 games re-
maining in the season. Green took
over, and later was reappointed for
1980. It really wasn’t Ozark’s fault.
The team was decimated by in-
juries. .

Bowa broke a thumb, -Trillo a
bone in his throwing forearm,

Luzinski pulled a thigh muscle,‘

McBride played 40 games on a

game knee, Schmidt played hurt-

Most devastating was the breaku
of the pitching staff. -

.It all started with righthander
Larry Christenson breaking a col-
larbone during a charity bike
marathon in February! 1979.
Righthander Dick Ruthven came
out of spring training with an
aching elbow and lasted until May.
Lefthander Randy Lerchbroke his
right wrist. ‘ Righthander, Nino
Espinosa rleveloped tendonitis in
his pitching shoulder. Reliever
Warren Brusstar was lost the entire
season. .

All teams, of course, have in-

‘juries, but the Phillies would have

good reasoneto doubt any team was

After listening to coach Coryea,
it would be no suprise to find Bond
back at the NCAA’s next year——this
time as one of those big contenders.

“This year if Mike hadn’t been
hurt, he would have had an out-
standing record,” said Coryea.
“He has the potential. He should be
an all-American before he’s done
here _at Pitt.” . I

-This past season was not only a
rocky one for Bond, but for the en-

tire Panther squad, as they struggl-

ed to a disappointing 3-13-1 finish.
Asked about the problems the Pan-
thers had this past season, under
first year head coach Rande Stot-
tlemyer, ‘Bond replied, “Certain
personal things caused some guys to
quit. We had a young team come up

at the end. They were good but they

were young and we had problems

with that. Just the change over
from one head coach to the other
makes it difficut; there were a ‘lot of
things that were different.”
“They’re hitting the recruiting
pretty hard right now,”- noted

Bond. “They’ve got some good ,9
people. You need competition in,

the wrestling room. You've got "to
have someone good to wrestle'with,
You need people to push you.
They’re working really hard," so
we’ll see what happens. If they get
some good people in there,- we’ll
have a good team.”

That could mean’ company for
Mike Bond at next year’s NCAA
championship.

RALEIGH, N.C.—As expected,
North Carolina State named Jim
Valvano of Iona College as its new

-I;'

L  T basketball coach Thursday.

A grinning Valvano, introduced

3  during a news conference, said his

selection to succeed Norm Sloan as
coach of the Wolfpack fulfilled a
longtime dream. .

A “I think I’m ready, I’m ready for

A the challenge," said Valvano, 34,
' who led Iona to a 29-5 record and a

No. 19 ranking this past season.

Pennsylvania Stars Meet. United Setes Stars In Classic

By The Associated Press

_— PITTSBURGH_—Twin brothers,
a big man who can run and the son

] of a well—known college coach are

among the ‘high school basketball
stars who’ll play for the United
States team in’ Friday night’s
Roundball Classic.

I The twins, who’ll oppose a squad
of Pennsylvania All-Stars, are Vern
and Victor Fleming of Queens,
N.Y. Both are 6—foot-5, 180-pound

  
  

“I feel right now I’m ready to
coach in the highest level,” he said,
calling the Atlantic ‘Coast Con-
ference an “unbelievable league.”

“I waited 13 years to getlan inter-
view at an institution like North
Carolina State,” said Valvano, who
also has been head coach at Johns
Hopkins and Bucknell. “I said I
wasn’t going to blow it.” ,

Numerous stories since Sloan
resigned after 14 years as N .C. State
coach had Valvano’s name far
down the list of candidates. Among

guards, right-handed shooters and
tough defensive players.

Yet they did not play on the same .

high school team. Vern averaged
25.4 points per game at private
Mater Christi High School. ‘Victor
averaged 16‘ points per game at
public Long Island City High
School.

“They play both ends of the floor
and they are in motion for 32
minutes, always moving with or

 

.4,

those repdrted to have been front-
runners were Morgan Wotten of

_ De Matha High School in Hyatt-

sville, Md., Bill Foster of Clemson,
Tom Young of Rutgers and Kansas
State’s- Jack Hartman. ’

But N.C. State Athletic Director
Willis Casey said, “This job was of-
fered to one man and one man
only.” -

Casey said Valvano would be
given a t"1ve—year contract with a
salary in the vicinity of $40,000 to
$45,000 a year. exclusive of any

without the ball,” saidy Mater
Christi coach Jim Gatto.

Also with the U.S. team. will be

ing_arn High School to‘ the
Washington, D.C., city champion-
ship last season,-averaging 21 points

_and 17 rebounds per game.

never seen a big man that fast,"
said Jerry Tarkanian, coach-at the
University of Nevada-Las Vegas.

television or basketb ‘T-camp con-
tracts he may negotiate.

Valvano joked that he hadn’t
bothered to ask the salary when he
ws first offered the job. “I-wanted
to. come to State that badly,” he
said. '

He said he had six fine years at_
Iona in New Rochelle, N.Y., but
“My desire to come here was on the
dream-you-dream basis."’

. Of the N.C. State job, he said,

“It wouldn’t surprise me if he
wasn’t the fastest player here,” he
added.

Tarkanian is known ' for_ his
recruiting vigor, yet one player on
the U.S. team will be especially
close to his heart——his son, Danny.

ed 23. points and‘ 10 assists this
