The Panhellenic Council at‘ the

that -Pitt was the only school .at
which rushing events with men

This question was raised last
year, and was carried in favor of
men by a narrow. margin.
change in attitude of the Council
is due largely to the attempt to les-
sen the expenses of fraternity life
sincemost local groups are operat-

this year. 7

Any Student Picking This Amount From Blight-free
' Tree Within 100 Miles of City Gets Reward

Five dollars for a pint of chestnuts!
This is what Professor Roswell H. Johnson, head of the depart-

ment of oil and gas production, is

offering the lucky person who can

show him a chestnut tree growing within 100 miles of Pittsburgh which
is producing chestnuts free from blight-

Due to the severity of the blight, Johnson says, there is not a
single chestnut tree in this part of the country which is free from the

disease. although there have re:

cently been rumors to the contra-
ry. If he can procure some healthy
specimens of the nut, Johnson Will
cross them with a Chinese species
of which he has a grove of 20 blight-
free trees. This latter type, which
is the most resistant to the dis-
ease of all the che-stnuts, when
crossed with the American variety
is expected to produce a very
healthy stock.

The need of ch-estnut trees which
can resist the blight is very great,

Dr. Ferguson, Once Suspected of Being a German
Spy, I-Ias Penchant For Baby Grand Pianos

By HELEN WEIDELI

Years ago, in Leipzig University, in Germany, a poor fel-
lowship student hobnobbed with royalty. Together with the
Chancellor’s daughter, this student attended a lecture and, as
luck would have it they sat in the row behind the King of Sax-
ony. His Majesty, having indulged too heavily in royal meat
and drink soon became drowsy and the crowned head nodded
drearily. The shiny oval on the back of the regal head, sparsely

fringed with
proved too much of a temptation
to the bored couple. Each time
the head drooped the girl’s feather
fan softly carressed the mirrow-
like surface causing A the king to
wakenwith a start. Thus, Dr. John
M. Ferguson then the student,
proved the old adage—“Uneasy
lies the head that wears the crown.”

Dr. Ferguson, assistant profes-
sor of economics for the past six
years, has earned ﬁve degrees: A.
B. at Harvard; M. A.; LL. B. and
Ph. D. at Columbia; and J. U. D.
at the Leipzig University in Ger-
many.

Dr. Ferguson attended Leipzig
University during the critical pe-
riod at the beginning of the World
War. After leaving the University
and while en route/home, he was
arrested in Paris suspected as be-
ing a German spv because he spoke
German on the train and could not
produce a passport. He was re»-
leased, however, the next morning
after spending a very pleasant and
-entertaining night in the Paris
hoosegow. Upon his return to the
United States, he enlisted in the
aviation corps of the Army and was
injured in a plane crack-up while
still a student pilot.

Of the high-spots of the ﬂrfteen
months spent at Leipsiz the most

  
  
  
   
  
 
  

fast greying hair,¢

the duel from which he emerged
bearing a most honorable scar. The
ﬁghting of a duel, called “Fackten,”
was one of the requirements for
entrance into the fellowship of the
Saxonia Fraternity.

Among other peculiarities of the
German customs, as related by Dr.
Ferguson, was the matter of enter-
taining the fair sex. No student
was permitted to take out a agirl
alone unless they were engaged. In
attending a theater it was the cus-
tom to call in a cab for the young
lady and her father and mother. In
the theater-box the girl sat in the
ﬁrst row with her mother and the
-student sat in the second row with
her father.

Dr. Ferguson's favorite amuse-
ment is playing the piano. He has
a weakness for Baby Grand pianos
and his favorite popular song is
“Who’s Your Little Whoosis?”

-Among other accomplishments he

has written three books: one a
German book required to obtain his
degree; the others were “State
Regulation of Railroads” and the
“Social Workers’ Handbook.”

In commenting on the present
economic depression Dr. Ferguson
says, “It is an aftermath of the
World War. The only way to end
the depression is to buy more and

‘interesting, to Dr. -Ferguson, was force the prices up.”

about the gigantic task of integrat-

On Manchuria

ed In Talk To

Inquiry Club

——--— r

,_ Striking a keynote with his state-
ment that, “The Manchurian situa-
tion is a much greater crisis to the
stability and power of the League
of Nations than it is to either the
Japanese or Chinese nation,” Dr.
Brynjolf Hovde of the history de-
partment, outlined the Japanese-

Club last week.

Dr. Hovde went on to say that
“If Japan takes Manchuria by
force, China will in time. with her
ever growing consciousness of na-
tionalism, take it back in the same
way. The conclu-sion of the strife
in the immediate future is the crit-
ical duty facing the League.”

Dr. Hovde summarized the cause
of the recent conﬂict as the resent-
ment and opposition of the nation-

authority of Japan in Manchuria.

In the leading article, “The De-

Dr. Francis D. Tyson-, professor of
economics, discussed the underlying
cause of the complex economic
phenomena of the day, and points
out the fact that “Our ﬁnancial and
industrial institutions have de-
veloped to a stage in which an ex-
perimental era of conscious man-
agement should succeed the era of
undirected material evolution.”
This is the first in a series of two
articles by Dr. Tyson investigating
the problems‘ of the depression.

Dr. H. H. Collins, professor of
zoology, contributes an article,
“The Science of Life and the Phil-

the evolutionary process.

Dr. Boots Speaks Before

Crafton Business Group

 

“Municipal Efficiency” was the
subject of a speech given before
the Crafton Business Men’s Asso-
ciation, last Monday evening at
the Christian Church of Crafton.
by Dr. Ralph S. Boots, professor
of political science.

Dr. Boots stated that politics
should have no place in determin-
ing the personnel of city adminis-
trative offices and that a widely-
considered remedy is the profes-
sionalizing of public oﬁices. Adop-
tion of such a remedy, he believes,
would involve technical and spe-
cialized training as a prerequisite
to holding public oﬂice.

Users of Bell System service ask “Informa-

day. Providing facilities for answering them
promptly, correctly, was one problem put up
to engineers of the Bell System.

So effective was their solution that this
prodigious task is now a matter of smooth
routine. They designed desks which enable

each operator to reach quickly the listings of
some 15,500,000 telephones. They developed
apparatus which automatically routes calls to
operators not busy—and should all operators
be busy at once, it stores up calls and releases
them in the order received!

Eﬂicient telephone service depends upon

three men, Onder, Simms and Sebastian, on the second team.

\

 

The all-American board made its annual selections last week and
concluded its work by saying that every man picked on the ﬁrslt teialn;
n a
event, the team was not an all-American selection but a combination
of the players who played their best on the days on which they were
seen by members of the Board. The selection of Yarr, Notre Dame cap-
tain, over Ralph Daugherty, Pitt star pivotman, occasioned some sur-
prise. However, the fact that Jesse Harper, athletic director of Notre
Dame and successor to Knute Rockne as a member of the all-American
Board, saw Yarr in action more than he did Daugherty, may have in-
ﬂuenced the decision. Some weeks a player is better in one particular
department of the game than he is in that department another week.
In the same manner, he is likely to show more ab-ility over a period of
games than one player does in one of the best games he plays during
a season. For that reason, Harper may truthfully have believed that
Yarr was a better player than Daugherty even though the latter out-
played the Notre Dame ca.ptain in the duel between the two teams of

which they were members.

 

All-American pickers have the habit of according the captain of a

. major college eleven which has a poor season greater mention than the

other members of the same team. Many of the all-East and the all-

' American teams which have been picked thus far have accorded honor-

able mention to Murray Armentrout, who captained the Carnegie Tech
team this year from a halfback position; yet his name ha.s not graced
the all-opponent teams of the major schools on the Tartan schedule
this year.

On the other hand, George Kavel, the other regular halfback, has
made a favorable impression in every game in which he has partici-
pated to date and has been picked on the all-opponent teams of Notre
Dame" and Pitt, two schools which opposed some of the best teams and
came into contact with some of the best players in the country. The
professional pickers obviously showed a weakness in this respect. They
merely singled Armentrout out because he was the captain and left
Kavel out because a team having the record which this year’s Tech
team possesses ordinarily would not have two halfbacks worthy of
all-America mention. '

In the case of the Pitt team, there have been varied opinions as
Similar
questions have arisen with respect to Heller and Reider and also
Hirshberg and Collins. One of the all-state teams published recently
placed Hirshberg on the ﬁrst team and Collins on the second team.

. The all-American board accorded Collins honorable mention but did not

include Hirshberg.

The difference between the two tackles perhaps will always remain
a matter of dispute. MacMurdo was boosted from the start of the
season as a. possible all-American. Quatse, on the other hand, suffered
an early injury in training camp and was not expected to be a regular
this year. He recovered quicklyfrom the injury, however ,and played
a steady game throughout the season.

He made his best showing in the Notre Dame game this year. Fans
will recall that Schwartz made that 60-yard run for Notre Dame’s
ﬁrst touchdown in its game with Pitt last year on a play which started
as a dash oﬁ! Qatse’s tackle. Notre Dame naturally expected that it
would have little trouble repeating the trick this year; and when it
failed to do so and Quatse continued in the game until late in the
fourth quarter when his face appeared as if it had been in the path of
a tractor, he naturally made quite an impression upon the Irish oili-
cials.

When Hunk Anderson announced over the radio that Sunday night
that Quatse was one of the three bestslineme-n to oppose the Irish this
year, most of the all-America pickers were putting the ﬁnishing touches
on their teams and naturally took Anderson's words under advisement.
We do not intend, however, to take any honors away from Quatse, who
is deserving of all the praise which he has received of late, for he
obtained his standing with the help of very little publicity; but the
fact remains that there is no such thing as an all-America and -anybody
who thinks so is crazy.

Many people have come to look upon. the team selected by the all-
America Board of football as the ofﬁcial team, but there are too many
incidents which have cropped up as a result of the selections for the
general public to swallow them hook, line and sinker. The men who
pick the team naturally have a better chance to know their own play-
ers than those who perform forthe other-teams in the country. Last
year, Reb Russell played a whale of a game against Notre Dame and
was picked as fullback by” the all-America Board. This year, he was
not even mentioned. Last year, Carnegie Tech defeated Georgia Tech,
31-0. Georgia Tech had six of its players placed on the honorable
mention list, while Carnegie Tech had one. In 1924, Stueldreher (don’t
blame merif it’s misspelled) was practically the only Notre Dame player
who was mentioned on every all-America team. The rest of the “Four
Horsemen? were considered good, but nobody was giving them ﬁrst
team berths; but the all-America Board placed Crowley and Layden on
its mythical team in addition to the quarterback.

at‘

 

Small college players don’t have much chance to make these all-,
America teams. Practically everybody in this district who is a follower
of football has heard of “Gyp” Battles, the ﬂying halfback for West
Virginia Wesleyan who has been considered the best halfback of the
year by nearly everybody who has seen him in action, yet he has not
been selected on any all-America team unless his school paper picked

« 0118.

Even though a player as good as Battles is named on an a1l-sec-
tional team, he has little or no chance to -be recognized nationally. In
1929, Clark Hinkle was selected as fullback on the United Press’ all-
Eastern team and Pug Parkinson of the undefeated Pitt team of that
year was placed on the second team. A week later, the United Press
announced its l-America team. The name of the ﬁrst team fullback
escapes me, bu Parkinson was the second team choice; while Hinkle
received honorable mention. That takes the cake.

Talking about Pitt, however, the Panthers should have a great
team next year even though every regular of this year’s line grad-
uates. Jock Sutherland is known far and wide as a great line coach,
and he can be depended upon to develop a line next year which will
prove a worthy successor of this year’s forward wall. Jimmy Clark is

. mingling with the common peons.

Luch, Love, Heller Join
Mitt Squad; Team
Moves Quarters

Final preparations are being
concluded by the Panther boxers,
and the ﬁnal smoothing off process
has begun for the College boxing
championships, to be held at the

Stadium pavilion next Thursday,
December 17, For the beneﬁt of
those who wish to attend both
the Yuletide festival and the box-
ing matches, the bouts will start
at 7 o’clock, and the admission is
free. A true collegiate boxing at-
mosphere is expected to prevail
with the tux-clothed dance-goers

The boxers have moved down
from the track house to the warm-
er conﬁnes of the stadium dress-
ing room, and wil1.practice there
to accustom themselves to the ring
that has been set up.

The football squad is well repre-
sented on the boxing team with
Luch, Love, Heller, and many oth-
ers having already signiﬁed their
willingness to take and give for
Pitt.

Eight Bouts To Be Held

There will be eight bouts in all
on Thursday’s card, each one being
of three two minute rounds with a
_minute rest between rounds. The
referee’s decision will determine
the winner. Bouts have been ar-
ranged in every class. but to date,
the ﬁghters have not been picked
for the 175 pound bout. The win-
ners of the bouts will be the prob-
able varsity men for the coming
season, and from reliable sources
comes word that the bouts will be
much better than those put up by
Pitt boys during the last season.

Patterson and Carmella will lift
the lid on the activities when they
touch gloves for the 115» pound
championship. Both boys have
shown much improvement over
last year, and although Patterson
has. an advantage in previous ex-
perience, it will not be surprising
to ﬁnd out after the ﬁght that Car-
mella is the better man.

Junior Colleglans Fight

Zaiden and Puglia will clash in
the 125 pound bout; and as both
boys are newcomers, little is
known of them. The ﬁght should
be good just the same. After the
decision of the Zaiden-Puglia ﬁght
has been given, Martin‘ and Gian-
natti will meet for the 135 pound
title. Martin has the edge on
Glannatti, but anything can, and is
likely, to happen.

Billy Evans and Dale Madelon,
both fast steppers, will meet in an-
other 135 pound bout, These two
boys are about even, and the ﬁnish
of the ﬁght can not be predicted‘
accurately. Marius Santicola makes
his first appearance this year
against Matty Rubbo. Rubbo has

Open Season

Meet Greensburg Floor
Squad Tonight

 

The freshman baske_t ball squad
formally opens the current season
tonight with Greensburg High
school at Greensburg. Not much
is known about Greensburg, ex-
cept the fact they usually have
formidable teams. It is a certainty
that Greensburg will be a stiff test
for the frosh.

Tomorrow night the yearlings
pry open the home season with
Taylor Allderdice High school as
a preliminary to the Pitt-Temple
game. Allderdice is reputed to
have a smooth-functioning ma-
chine made up of veterans.

-Coach Paul Zehfuss has been
bringing his proteges along slow-
ly until he now believes he has
rounded them oﬁ until they can
compete with the stiffest competi-

shown lots of promise, and Santi-
cola is expected to have his hands
full retaining -the varsity berth he
held last year.
Shricker, Newby clash

In what is expected to be the

fastest ﬁght of the evening, Jack

Shricker will attempt to persuade

Rand Newby that he (Shricker) is
still the leading 160 pounder at
Pitt. Newby is expected to have
quite a lot to say about that, how-
ever. The ﬁghters for the 175

pound class have not been picked
yet, but will be announced at the

championships, immediately after
the Shricker-Newby bout.
The main event of the evening

tion that is oﬁered by the high
school and college freshman

Kuno, Zeleznick and Ames are due

notoriously hard hitters, but Luch

Riflers Defeat Cooper

From this week on until the end
of the rifle season, the Pitt» var-
sity gunners will engage in tele-
graphic matches with other col-
leges. Very few shoulder-to-shoul-
der shoots are scheduled, the most
important being those with Carne-
gie Tech and the regional meets
in the spring.

Pitt would want to cop the Tech
match more than any other not
only because of the intense. rivalry
between the two schools, butpalso
because Tech usually has one of
the best teams in the country.

So far this season, Pitt has en-
gaged in two telegraphic matches,
winning the ﬁrst from Cooper
Union, 1371 to 1214. The results
of the Penn meet are not known at
present. Vfurtenberger, Wilson,
"Captain Backen, Franz, and Mair
were the ﬁve highest scorers in
the ﬁrst match.

Next week the riflers take on

PACE FOUR

Pitt Cagers Will Open Season Tomorrow; With _T_emple
Carlson Holds Annual ;  

Clinic in Conjunction  
With Inaugural Game.-or

 

Following a strenuous month of daily work-outs and prac-

morrow night against the formidable Temple ﬂoormen of Phil-

tice tilts with the leading independent aggregations of thisidis-ye E
trict, Doc Carlson ’s 1931-’32 ﬂoor machine swings into action to-

ed the representatives of the Home-.

adelphia.

Officially prying oﬁ the local collegiate basket ball lid,
“them demon mites,” Timmy Lawry and Docky_KoWallis, will - ,
lead the Golden Panthers into action from their respective for-  ,-

ward berths.
utive lads are expected to cap
their ﬁnal season on the hardwoods
with great records, and in the pre-
liminary games both have been
hitting the net in mid-season form.

Russ Ochsenhirt, rangy Perry
High product, seems to be the lead-
ing choice to ﬁll the vacancy made
by the decision of Bus Albright to
forsake the ﬂoor sport because of

his health and the press or his
scholastic duties. In addition to
being highly effective under the
basket, Ochsenhirt seems to ﬁt in-
to the fast-moving Carlson system
with the ease of a veteran.

Smith at Guard.

The bulwark of the backcourt is
the smiling, good-natured, husky
Don Smith, Bellevue’s pride and
joy. Possessed of an ideal temper-
ament and as tough a guard to
elude as any in this district, Smit-
ty is going great guns again this
year.

A good-looking, slim, smooth
ball handler in the personage of
Don McCamant of Sharon, seems
destined to .cop the other guard job
opposite Smith. After coming to
Pitt with a spectacular high school
record behind him, McCamant ran
into that old Pittsburgh nemesis——
sickness. Right now, however, he
is leading all other candidates for
the job; even though he, only a
sophomore, faces stern competi-
tion from “Tip” Kowallis and “A1”
Wrobleski, both of whom are sen-
iors.

». S. Kowallis and Wrobleski are
both small trick ﬂoormen and un-
doubtedly will see plenty of serv-
ice this winter. ‘Carl Forsberg,
lanky Erie Junior College. lad, is
slated to understudy Ochsenhirt at
center, while Charley Hughes,
Bogda, Brown, Katz, McBride, So-
bel, Beck and Hunt comprise the
remainder of the squad.

When the Carlsonites trek out on
the Stadium ﬂoor, they will face

the East. Although the Pittites
did not meet Temple last sea-
son, in 1927-28 the Golden Panthers

The Pitt football team can lay
claim to two of the outstanding
linesmen in the country in Jess
Quatse and “Big Jim” MacMurdo,
tackles. Both of these boys have

been named on All-American
teams several times and have been
called the best pair of tackles in
the East, Tad Jones, former Yale
coach, naming both to his All-
Eastern team.

Quatse was picked to the ﬁrst
teams of the All-American elevens
of the United News and the All-
American Board. The latter re-
ceives probably the greatest pub-
licity of any group of critics.

Quatse Strong Man

Quatse has been on the Pitt var-
sity for three years. He has de-
veloped continually and persistent-
ly throughout his career, never
receiving much attention from
critics until near the middle of
this season. He rose to great
heights during the Army and No-
tre Dame games, playing, in the
latter, with a badly bleeding
mouth., A fierce charger and a
powerful tackler, he is considered
the strongest man on the Pitt
team.

MacMurdo was not named to the
ﬁrst team of any of the widely
publicized All-American selections,
but was selected by several indi-
vidual experts such as Will
Wedge, New Yorlg sport critic.
“Big Jim” was named to the sec-
ond team of the Associated Press
and was -placed on the third team
by the All-Hearst concensus and

Select Panther ridmen
For All-America Teams

,the United News. In the Asso-
ciated Press selection he received
but ten votes less than Paul
Schweigler. first team selection.

Jim has been a regular since
,his sophomore year. He copped a
great deal of publicity by his feats
during his first season on the var-
sity but received less prominence
last year when he was switched
to end, which position he found
not to his liking. This year he
has come back with a vengeance
at tackle.

Daugherty Honored

Another Pitt lineman who ranks
with the best in the country is
Daugherty, center. The clean cut‘
Freeport boy was nominated for
the Associated Press second team
and the United News and All-
Hearst third teams. Daugherty is
another player who has been a reg-
ular since his sophomore year. He
has kept up in great style the tra-
dition of great Pitt centers, rank-
ing with ‘the very best when it
comes to defensive work.

The two Pitt “poison twins,"
Paul Reider and Warren Heller, re-
ceived honorable mention on every
All-American squad. Since both
are juniors, and sinceapopular be-
lief is beginning to spread that
they work best together, they had
little chance for higher All-Amer-
ican positions.

Mike -Milligan -and Paul “-Rip”
Collins, guard and end, also re-
ceived frequent mention. Both
are quiet, hard working boys
whose true worth has not been
really appreciated.

MacMurdo to Play in
East - West Grid Game

The issuance of an invitation to
Jim MacMurdo to participate in
-,the' annual charslty East-West
game, played on Christmas day in
San Francisco, makes the second
consecutive year that a Pitt man

has received this honor. Eddie
Baker went last year and made a
very, creditable showing.

The teams in this game will be
composed of the outstanding foot-
ball players in the Eastern and
Western sections of the country.
MacMurdo’s acceptance gives the
Eastern squad three’ players fre-
quently mentioned as All-American
choices, Morton, a half-back from
Dartmouth, and Orsi, a Colgate
end, being the other two.

Andy Kerr, coach of the Col-
gate team, will act in an advisory
capacity for the Eastern team.

Jim has been outstanding in
his three years of varsity play,
and he is expected to crash
through in ﬁne style against the
Western team, It is also very pos-
sible that two other Pitt linemen
will receive invitations to play in
this game, although no oﬂicial re-
ports to this effect have been re-
ceived. '

The opening of the Intramura.I

According to an announcement by
James Potts, assistant professor in

been enrolled. At the present time,
only five squads have signified
their intention of taking part in
the tournamen_t.

cept a fraternity, may organize as
a team. There should be eight
men on each squad, and each team
should have a definite playing
name. Games will be played in
the evenings. Each player must
bring his own equipment.

Mr. Potts is attempting to inter-
est the Engineers in the league,
feeling that the Engineers always
add spirit to a tournamnt in which
they take part. Basket ball prac-
tice in the boys’ freshmen gym
classes is to begin next week.
Many boys who display ability in
these practices are expected to or-
srenize teams for the league.

CREAM
OF THE
COLLEGES

Columbia University —— H. L.
Mencken, editor of the American

Mercury, made the following state-

ments in reply to a series of ques-
tions submitted to him by the “Co-
lumbia Spectator,” the school
mouth-organ: '

1. “The college student of to-
day is more conservative than his
father a generation ago.”

2. “Undergraduate literary work
is atrocious." ,

3. “Present entrance standards
make it impossible to expect a
group of intelligent college stu-
dents.”

4. “False values are propagated
in a wholesome manner by the
American colleges. Very few of
the professors who teach in them
are really civilized men, and rela-
tively few of the students come
from civilized homes. Thus the
cultural value of the college tends
to approximate zero.”

Northeastern College -- Are all

too certain a reply, but in at least
some»x‘.esp,ec,ts we judge they '.8.1‘é_.
Witness this piece from the
“Northeastern News:" “The best
dressed man at last Friday night's
dance wishes to thank G. L. for the
tie, T. M. for the tux shirt, P. H.
for the hat and his other three
friends for their minor accessories.
He states that all loans will be

recognition of their degrees.
Of course, these students have
the privilege of receiving their
diplomas at the spring com-
mencement, if they so wish,
but few. will be interested in
doing this for they will then
have been outlof schoo1.more
than three months.

But there is the practical
side as. well as the sentimental
side to the situation. The Feb-
ruary convocation has been
simply a. duplication of the June
commencement on a small ~
scale. It involved, however, as
much effort and expense as did
the -spring exercises. In this
year of economic difficulty, re-
duction of expenditures is -to

of the winter exercises offers a
splendid opportunity for put-
ting this policy into ‘eﬁect.
Pitt is not taking any lead
in abandonment of the convo-
cation. Indeed, -it is one of the
last of the universities to do
away with the winter com-
mencement. It is also con-
ceivable that by elimination of
the February ceremony, the
spring event can be made more
impressive and satisfying.“

An‘ Innovation

 

ANCE COMMITTEES are
, prone to follow in the
steps of their predecessors. As
a result, there is justification
in the criticism that Pitt
dances are all alike. They are
nearly always held at the same ‘
hotel, the favors are essential-
ly the same, and the decora-
tions usually lack originality. '
But their greatest fault lies in
the fact that they are repeated-

It isigratifying, therefore, to 9

observe that the group in
charge of the forthcoming Jun-
ior Prom has initiated a move-
ment that may prevent the ‘re-"
currence of the overcrowding.
Of course, there are some per-
sons who may rightfully say
that the price will guarantee
against over-capacity and that
favors ilhould have been» elim-
inated and the assessment re-
duced, but that may be beside
the point here.’

The plan devised ‘to prevent
overcrowding is a simple one.
Persons expecting to attend the
Prom are asked either to pur-
chase or to make a deposit on ,
their ticket until a short time
before the event. Tickets will
be held for a deposit of one dol-

' lar and may be lifted upon pay-
ment of the remainder of the
assessment. Failure to lift the
ticket means forfeiture of the

deposit. No tickets will be
sold at the hotel the night of
the dance.

.. The scheme seems fair and

equitable to all concerned. It ‘
is admittedly an experiment
and the committee should re-
serve the right to abandon the
idea if it fails to meet with
any great response. Its merit
seems to exist in the fact that
it possesses the key to the so-
lution of the overcrowding
problem. At the same time, it
stamps the committee as one
characterized by enterprise
and‘ originality.
