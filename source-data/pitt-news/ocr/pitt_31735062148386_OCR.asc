‘Model Student’
Kills Detective .
In Cleveland  

Psychologist Blames
Personality Change
For Sudden Crime

A noticeable, lack of interest
in his University courses was
the only indication that some-
thing was Wrong with “model
boy” John l\IcC0rmick, C40,.be-
fore he shot and killed a Cleve-
land detective Sunday night,
student and faculty acquaint-
ances asserted this week.

A political science major, McCor-

mick has been “a better than aver- V

age student” for his first three
years, his former teachers agreed.

Last semester‘ his “B” average
was reported to be the lowest he
made at the University. But the
most obvious drop, both in class at-
tention and in marks, came this
semester, his political science and
geography instructors ‘said.

Usually Quiet, Didn’t Mix ,

Where he had heretofore “demon-
strateda keen interest in school and
an apparent enjoyment .in his work,
his schoolwork this semester was
marked by constant absences from

class and below average grades,

they pointed out.

McCormick graduated
Peabody High school in 1936 with
highest honors, ﬁfth in a class of
165. '

McCormick was,‘ up to this year,
an active member of Phi Delta ’l‘he-
ta, national social fraternity for
men. His fraternity brothers de-
scribe him as “usually quiet, who
did not mix very much. He was al-
ways well dressed and always seem-
ed to have plenty of money.”

At the beginning of this semester,
however, he became an inactive
member of the fraternity. The rea-
son McCormick gave for this move,
according to John Dickinson, C40,
was that “his dad didn't want him
to remain active.”

Dickinson also pointed out that
McCormick was never Very out-
standing in fraternity activities.
“He kept to himself pretty much,”
he said. “But he was a nice and
likeable fellow.”

Submerged Personality

Originally labeled as an “impulse
robbery,” this theory was discount-
ed late Monday when McCormick
confessed participation in two other
hold-ups of similar nature.

On campus it was generally be-
lieved that the McCormick actions
on Sunday constituted a clear “pys-
chotlogikzal case”. ‘

Offering a possible solution a
representative of the psychology
department declared:

“Sometimes apparently normal
and intelligent people undergo a
personality revolution which com-
pletely changes‘ them. Usually,
however. the action can be traced to
a" submerged personality which
came into being from something
which happened early in child-
hood.”

Independents
Start Activities

First campus-wide political agti‘\/-
ity of the newly-formed Indepen-
dent Party steering committee will
be launched this week when a Poll
committee to be organized by the
non-fraternity group tomorrow be-
gins sounding out student political
sentiment throughout the Univer-
sity.. V ‘

Proceeding along the lines of the
George Gallup surveys, the 35-
member committee‘ will be assem-

imediately begin quizzing students
on three key political questions:

“Did you vote last year?” If ‘not,
“Why not?” “What do you expect
student govermnent to accomplish

The poll committee is under the
direction of Hiram Milton, C42.

Men’s Council tuxedo exchange,

Time Schedule, Nap
Needed in Preparing;
De-emphasis U rged’-

By Gertrude Lieblich
Cramming can be a beautiful ex-
perience for you. It never is for us,
but maybe you’re different. Like
winding your watch during class,
With

eﬁicient little time schedule, de-
signed to reduce cramming to its
most condensed and least tiresome
basis.

Assuming that you have two
hours to cram for each two-hour
exam, your time could be distrib-

uted in the following manner:

1. One-half hour to be devoted

to preparation for cramming, gath-
gering the necessary pencils, scratch
‘pads, apples, cigarettes, candy bars,

chewing gum, pillows, and soft
drinks.

2. One—half hour for a short
nap.

3. One-half hour for decipher-
ing the semester’s notes.

4. One-quarter hour for a brief
review of the semester’s doodles.

5. If you must, one-quarter hour
for cramming.

There, now wasn’t that easy?
You can master any subject! You
can take exams! They can take
you!

Now we would like to stress the
importance of de-cramming. This
process takes much less time. Some-
times you can feel the knowledge
dripping off you as you walk out
of the class. As one blonde sopho-
more remarked last year after she
left her exam paper on the front
desk, “Now I can forget every-
thing.”

It seems obvious that the whole

exam situation has been horribly
over-emphasized. We suggest that
exams be de-emphasized to the
point of eliminating them. Or, at
least, let’s be frank and call the
exam period by its rightful name,

“Hell Week.”

Am Gallery Display Survey
Of Architecture in Pittsbiirgh

By Anita Barone
Currently appearing in the seventh ﬂoor ﬁne arts gallery is a “Pho-
tographic Survey of Architecture in Pittsburgh,” which reveals how the
style of a clubhouse, hotel, or church in Pittsburgh may have been de-
rived from a Grecian temple or Venetian palace.

For example, the Twentieth Century club is similar to architecture

of the Italian Renaissance and
Heinz Chapel is suggestive of the
Saint Chapelle, Paris, _which is
French Gothic.

In the group are photographs of
local ‘ architecture alongside photo-
graphs of architecture from Ger-
many France, Italy, England, and
Russia, that are comparable in
style, period, and structure.

The exhibition was planned in
order to illustrate more clearly, the
relationships of some of the great
architectural traditions to our own
local styles. .

The photographs reveal how arch“
itects have combined motifs, taken
from architectural treatises, and
cleverly adapted them to modern
use.

In compiling the photographs for
the exhibit it was found that the
architecture in Pittsburgh was for
the most part Byzantine, Gothic,
Grecian, Romanesque, Egyptian, or
Roman in character.

It was also found that in Italian
districts the churches, etc., were in
keeping with the Italian tradition
of architesture. -In other words,
racial districts tend to keep their art
in tradition with their nationality.

Included in the exhibit is one ex-
ample of completely American
architecture, the home of Edgar J.
Kaufmann, designed by Frank
Lloyd Wright.

In a vivid way the exhibition
makes us realize the lack of crea-
tiveness on the part of Americans
in ornamental detail, as a reflection
of modern taste, for the completely

2 modernand original home designed

by Wright is completely lacking in
ornamental ‘detail. ‘ ‘

Other activities of the club would
include dances, banquets, picnics,
and similar social functions-

A Tragic Affair
And Mental Health

Probably no phrase occurred more often among
those who knew the University student involved in
the unfortunate affair in Cleveland than “you’d
Yet it did happen
that’ a. University man tossed away his whole past

never expect that from him.”

and his whole future in one wild escapade.

If we believe that behavior is caused by some-
thing, by factors in our environment, we must ex-
plain why one in that environment was able to
commit such a crime.

If we are told that universities are interested
less in teaching “things” than in instilling ideals,

if-_by,_tl1eir activities they assume charge over the"

whole of the student ‘s personality, if they train him
or her to be a better man or woman, then how can
this tragicpcase be explained?

For how eana student have anything instilled
in“ him if the emotional stability, the proper adjust’-
ment to cnvironlneiital conditions, are 11ot'his°?' It
would seem fundamental to teaching that the per-
sonal problems of a student must be solved first.

This is not the first tragedy to a University stu-
dent this term. Others have occurred in pre-
vious years. A.nd how many students have been
prevented from traveling the road to maladjust-
ment by the part-time efforts of Dr. Omar Held,
and by the" psychology clinic will never be known.

But it is evident’ that when such cases occur,
when classmates-of those ‘who attend our univer-
sities are allowed to reach a state where tragedy
strikes, then something in our teaching apparatus
is wrong. _

. Adequate facilities for the treatmen.t of psy-
chological problems might aid in the prevention of
such unfortunate incidents in the future. With
a properly equipped and adequately-manned psy-
chological clinic for students in existence, perhaps
some of those who ﬁnd relief by crime, by leaving
the motor run too long in a closed garage, or by
jumping over a bridge railing will still be students.

The Pitt News

To Explain Costs
In the Expansion Plan

Comment reaching us from members of the fac-
ulty indicates that a certain amount of confusion
has been caused by one point in the news story
and interview announcing Chancellor Bowm-an’s
$6,000,000 capital expenditure program for the
University.

In the article and interview, which appeared in
last Friday’s News, no distinction was drawn be-
tween the proposed $450,000 annualincrease in ex-
penditure for faculty salaries and similar needs,
and the $6,000,000 of capital expense items in the
new program. '

Both of the proposed expenditures were dis-
cussed in the same announcement. However, the
éIa"6‘,(l00',‘0‘00 total for building needs would be strict-
ly an addition to the University’s physical plant,
while the $450,000 amount would be an annual in-
creased c‘liarg'e in the University budget. _

This rise in the operating budget would take
care of some things seriously needed at the Uni-
versity-at’ 10 per cent increase in salaries for
faculty and staff members who receive less than
$5,000 per year, a small average decrease in teach-
ing loads to permit more research, and necessary
additions in books, periodicals, and laboratory
apparatus.

Junior {Dptimists

It’s’a. ﬁne thing to be optimistic at this chilly
time of the year, with spring only about three
months away, and the blood-thirsty Finns slaugh-
tering the peaceful Russians by the thousands.

Vile don ’t.like to draw obnoxious parallels, but‘
it appears that the supreme group of optimists, at
least in the University, is the Junior Prom com-
mittee. Bob Shaw aiid his aides have tackled a
formidable task in more ways than one.

It will not be easy to produce a proﬁt from a
foI:Ir-dollar dance with a big—name band, when the
affair happens to be scheduled for the first day of
exaininations. But the juniors might make money,
even with the questionable help of the poster on
the eiglith floor, which gives detailed information
about the dance, but fails to mention the words
“Junior Prom. ”

For President

Here’s the Field of Democratic Leaders

This is.th.e first of two articles on the prospective
'no'_rn'i/nees for the coming p7'esiclentia.l compaign. The
next article will cover the Republican hopefuls.

By Kal Kalwary

The main requirement of a candidate for political
ofﬁce, as Abe Lincoln said in the play of the same name,
is to get elected. We must consider the possible nomi-
nees of the two major parties in this light.

' Under the democratic process, it is almost an auto-
matic requirement that the man be. mediocre, because
so many different sectional, political, economic, and
psychological factors have to be satisﬁediin his choice.
If you have ever studied the “principles of political
availability” (Pol. Sci._ 2), you ,will understand why
democracies seldom have great leaders. Maybe this is
just as well. But let us consider who may be pro-
claimed as’ great leaders in 1940. . .

The difficulty faced by‘ many politicians in the Dem-
ocratic party is that President Roosevelt is still coy.
If they work now for their own nomination they are
subconsciously in the popular mind '(which still retains
an"_.instinctive faith in Roosevelt) viewed as stabbing
him in the back.

McNutt. Calls Himself ‘Liberal’

. Close friends of Roosevelt say that he will run for
a third term. It is possible" that the .Messianic com-
plex ﬁnally over-powered him. It is also possible that
he feels ‘he must save the ‘world, now that it is en-
gaged in war. He has said many timesthat America,
must aid the democracies. In many ways he resem-
bles the ill—fated Wilson. And itiis signiﬁcant thatihis

Paul V. McNutt is making himself prominent as a

Democratic hopeful. While considered to be an effi-
cient administrator, his main debits are:
ically connotative name, (2) vicious anti-labor record
in Indiana, including the habit of calling out militia
and imposing martial law, (3) and his good looks. (He
is terriﬁcally photogenic, but close-up he has a hard,
bitter face.) Women would vote for him, but males
distrust him. McNutt now claims, in the Current fash-
ion, that he is a “liberal,” and the New Deal inner cir-
cle is beginning to accept him.

Jack Garner, on the other hand, admits‘ he is a,
stand-patter, if not a reactionary. He is nothing but
,a poker-playing politician, and his best friends never

. claimed anything better for him. He has sabotaged

New Deal legislation, and is therefore the darling of
the die—hards and Southerners in the party.

Jim Farley has the machinery to make himself the
nominee, but he is a shrewd enough politician to re-
member that it was the religious issue which beat Al
Smith. Farley will most likely compromise for the
vice-presidency.

ways glad to help a campus organ-

facilities in the Cathedral are lua-
dequate, and until money is avail-
able, they can’t be improved much.

Special Act Excludes Labor

In Fraternity House from Tax

NEW YORY ClTY—(ACP)——Def-
inite word that the Social Security
Act passages which forced, college
fraternal organizations to pay the
special employment taxes had been
cancelled by a special act of con-
gress has been reported to the exec-
utive committee of the _Nat:ional In-
terfraternity Conference.

The new amendment went into
effect on January 1 1940, and pro-
vides that “domestic service in a
private home, local college club, or
local chapter of a college fratern-
ity or sorority” be excepted after
that date.

The measure also excepts from
the jurisdiction of the Social Secur-
ity Act any service that does not-
provide a remuneration that ex-
ceeds $45 and service that is “per-
formed by a student who is enrolled
and is regularly attending classes at
a school, college or university.”

Psychology Clinic
Helps in Solving
Student Problems

In a recent report Columbia Uni-
versity states that its psycho-edu-
cational clinic had aided over 500
student cases in the last year and
that approximately ten per cent of
its freshman class were aided by
the clinic. , ,

Similar reports from other
schools in the country show the
rising interest of the colleges‘ in
the proper mental, as well as phys-
ical adjustment to the student body.

Few of the _cases needed actual
psychiatric care. Mostly the work
was to help a student get properly
adjusted to his student‘ life; it in-'
volved such_ things as vocational
guidance, helping course selection,.
adjus»tment“to college ‘life, and sim-
ilar other personal problems. ii

The need for the increase of such
clinics is established by the high
percentage of students who fail in
colleges. The solving of personal
or vocational problems, it is held,
would reduce the number of such
failures.

from the

Sidelines

By Bill McElwain
Sports Editor

Any way you take it, basketball is here to stay. This not-too-
astounding statement is made after a thorough survey of the problem
and a quick look at the 1940 edition of Doctor Clifford Carlson’s basket-

ball team.

We draw our conclusions from a mass of ‘circumstantial evidence
which came out before, during, and after the Pitt-Penn State game Sat-
urday night, won, to keep the record straight, by the aforementioned Dr.

Carlson’s boys.

First, there were the records of the two teams_

The Panthers had

been slapped from one side of the courtto the other by four of the ﬁve
teams they had met, and consequently were not, on the surface, a ball
club that would be expected to‘ pack in the cash customers.

A Cold Night, T 00

The Lions, after taking trimmings from Bucknell and Wash-Jeﬁ?,
spent a week in the wilds of Ohio where they dug up three willing push-

overs and held basket shooting practice.

All in all, the game scarcely

stacked up as a meeting of national cage powers,

Then, too, it was cold Saturday night, plenty cold, and in spite of
the steam-heated Stadium pavilion, it took some time to thaw out after

climbing the DeSota street hill.

Thus, it would not have been amazing

if the evening’s festivities had drawn a record-breaking inattendance.

Yet, about 1500 people and Penn State rooters brushed the dust oﬁ
the Stadium benches and settled down to watch the Carlsonmen alternate

with John Lawther’s proteges in missing scoring opportunities.

Ina

typical State-Pitt battle, adherents of both teams yelled themselves hoarse

and went home satisﬁed.

When that many people can become so excited over two clubs who
have shown as little as the Lions and the Panthers had prior to the game,
the sport. must have a tremendous hold on its followers.

Panthers Used To Western Style

The totally different style of play which the Panthers had found in
their mid-western tour slowed them up a bit in the early stages of the

game.

Used to the charging, rough-house tactics of the mid-westerners,

they were well on their way to losing the entire squad by personal fouls
when they ﬁnally caught on to the peculiar requirements of officials

Ketchell and Montgomery.

That the no-contact dictum enforced by eastern officials has a ham-
pering effect on teams used to the less exacting game found, for example,
in the Western Conference cannot be questioned and provides strong sup-
port for the advocates of a uniform method of officiating.

In the end, we believe that the East must loosen up and succumb to
the inﬂuence of the West and Mid-West if only for ﬁnancial reasons.
Basketball is popular in the East, but in other sections of the country,
where defenses are thrown away for wooly offenses and the personal foul
rule is enforced only when no police are in sight, the ﬂoor game is pack-
ing in the fans night after night and small college towns have gymnasium
seating capacities larger than their population.

Titans Bring Unbeaten Record

To Stadium Floor This Evening

Undefeated Westminster will tangle with its first serious obstacle of
the current campaign when it bumps against a victory farnished Panther

team at the stadium tonight.
the undefeated after two starts.

After tripping Slippery Rock, the Washabaugh coached team romped

away with 50-45 win, over Pitt’s
Oakland rival, Carnegie Tech.

This will mark the Titan’s sec-
ond bid for district. ﬂoor honors, the
first in Titan history coming last
year when they battered their way
to the top of heap with a finer win
average than the Duquesne team
of last year, supposedly Pittsburgh’s
best.

Eight Lettermen Back

Eight lettermen return to the
scenes of their triumphs, an octet of
the ﬁnest district players, ﬁve of
them local high school performers.
They are: Mel Miller, lanky cap-
tain from New Brighton; Tommy
Patton, Charley Ridl, Dick Fawcett,
Lee Fox, Joe Hetra, Joe Spak and

To date, the Titans remain in the ranks of

tors in two, and the victims of an
overtime at Columbus where Mich-
igan spurted with an 11 point dash
in the extra period.

The Panthers have six tussles of
hard experience under their belts
while the Titans have but two, both
against teams of “unknown qual-
ity.” Both of their “opponents put
up hapless performances‘ and the
clash with Pitt should prove the
capabilities of either team. For
Westminster, it may mean another’
district title: "For Pitt, perhaps, a
successful season.

PiKA Leads

Pi Kappa Alpha continues to set
the pace in the inter-fraternity
bowling loop as the winter intra-

come the Sigma Chis, their record
showing 11 triumphs and four de-
feats for a mark of .733.

A glance at the box scores shows
that there have been several per-
formances worthy of mention, both
team and individual. John Crippen
of Theta Chi posted a 213 for a one-
game high. Bruce of Kappa Sigma
was only one marker behind when
he registered a 212 in ten frames.
Bruce is also credited with the in-
dividual high for three games, 475,
a 158.6 average per game.

Pi Lambda Phi heads the list in
team scoring averages, their three
games’ 2029, giving a 1.35.5 rating

one game ranks Theta Chi as the
squad, a 704 total. a 141 average per

contest rates them second in this
category, while Delta Tau Delta
chalked up 699 on one occasion.

The Delt liigli authority, Jim

  Debaters
 Place Blame

On Germany

Creating a distinction between
the terms “blame” and “cause” as
a basis for their case, the Washing-
ton and Jefferson debaters declared
that the Allies could in no way be
blamed for the present European
war situation in a discussion with
the University team before an. In-
quiry Forum audience last Monday
afternoon.

With the University squad of Ed
Beigal, C472 and Harold Byer, C42,
upholding the aﬁ‘irmative of the
qu.estion,.,f,‘Resolved: That the basic
blame for the war in ELu.‘Qp,e rests
with the Allies,” the ,two,tea,ms~met
in the ﬁrst of a series of three non-
decision, intercollegiate debates
slated for presentation during the
coming. semester at Inquiry Forum
gessions. Robert Ceisler and Jack
Loynd, seniors, defended the nega-
tiveyfor the W ashington, and Jeffer-
son team.

After six minutes of speech-
making, the Washington and Jef-
ferson students stated their opinion:
“Germany is no more to blame than
any other country is, but she is
merely a victim of circumstances
because of the unfair distribution
"o1f'j'i‘;:"ésouz-ces in Central Europe?’

Defending the afﬁrmative of the
question, Beigel and Byer contend-

ed that the basic blame rests with ’

the Allied powers, since the policy
of Great Britain and France follow-
ing the Treaty of Versailles forced
Germany to wage war.

The‘ nubcf Allied blame rests on
the fact that in the early twenties
England and France refused to en-
forcieﬂthe provisions of the Treaty

of Versailles, the affirmative de-

S. Simon Seeks
Stolen Socks

A senior in the College has cold
feet these days.

Stanley Simon, C40, decorated
Yuletide Festival Mantle with his
thirteen stockings at the annual
Christmas song and dance act spon-
sored by Interfraternity Council.

Evidently expecting Santa Claus
to ﬁll his stockings, Simon, found
that somebody had ﬁlled his stock-
ings-—and walked away in them.

With the onset of .winter, shorter
pants, and deeper snow, he can no

longer go without socks.

To the souvenir hunters from the
fraternity dance, Simon makes one
tearful cry-—-“A pox on those who
stole my sox! '

Quart Tells of Chinese Customs,
Runs Restaurant to Go to School

By Virginia Porter

“N o matter what anyone tells you,
chop suey is really a Chinese dish,”
says Gain Quan, E43, who is run-
ning the Golden Gate tea room to
help pay his expenses at the Uni-
versity. , _

“The dish originated in China
and .was given its name by a. Chi-
nese  minister ..,when“he was.;vi~s-
-iting this country. However, chop
suey is not a part of the regular din-
ner course in China,” Quan ex-
plained.

Quan came to Pittsburgh from
San Franciso in September to enroll
at the University. Since the begin-
ning of December he has been the
part owner of the Murray avenue
resaurant.

“One of the unusual customs at
Chinese universities,” Quan contin-
ued, “is the fact that many students
have, as well as their family names,
a school name. The last name al-
ways remains the same, but a boy

5 gets a different ﬁrst name when he

enters school. And that is not the
last time his name changes, for he
is given another ﬁrst name when he
marries.” ,
Answering the inevitable query
about the outcome of the present
Sino-Japanese war. Quan expressed

the opinion that the Chinese would .

not win in the sense of succeeding
in so many battles. But eventually,
he added. the Japanese will become
exhausted; they will have to with-
draw; the Chinese will really win.

The Newcomer's Group of the
Women's Association at the Uni-
versity will erxtertain their hus-
builds at u covered-‘dish dinner par-
 Friday at 1:30" o’clock, at the
Heinz House, according to Mrs. A.
J. Miller. chairman of the dinner
and wife of Dr, Andrew Miller, lec-
turer in vocational education.

Entertainment for the evening
will consist of folk dancing, table

Survey Shows Changes

Cap, Gown Script in ROOS€V€lt Popularity

Collegians Disagree
With National Voters
On Presidential Issue

(By Student Opinion Surveys of
America.)

AUSTIN, Tex., Jan. 10. —- Al-
though a good majority of Ameri-
can college students continue their
approval of Franklin D. Roosevelt
as president, campus opinion has

not kept pace with the increasing-

support that the U. S. voter has
been giving the chief executive
since the European war broke out.

A coast-to-coast referendum of
collegians taken by the Student
Opinion Surveys of America shows
that more than three out of every
five “generally approve of Roose-
velt today as president.”

‘Small Loss Shown

This is only nine-tenths of one
per cent less than the vote of ap-
proval students gave F. D. R. a year
ago last month, according to the
continuous index of his popularity
that the Surveys has kept. These
scientiﬁc polls of college thought
are conducted through the coopera-
tion of n-early 150 member under-
graduate newspapers, including the
Pitt News.

Signiﬁcant are the comparisons
that now, after more than a year of
measuring student opinion, the Sur-
veys can make with other national
polls. It is clearly shown that the
moving world and national events
of recent months have not inﬂuenc-
ed student opinion as much as na-
tional public opinion which since
the start of the war has far out-
stripped the collegians in approval
of the president. Here is the rec-
ord:

Approve of F. D. R. Dec. ’38 Now
Poll of U. S. Voters.55.5% 64.9%
Poll of U. S. Students.62.8% 61.9%

‘Thus, while last December there
was a greater percentage of students
in favor of Roosevelt than there was
of voters, events since then have
caused the rank and ﬁle to change
its attitudes, while student approval
is in almost a straight line, and even
slightly less than a year ago.

South Most Emphatic

Students in New England, the
Middle Atlantic and East Central
states, as usual, today are less in
favor of the president than other
sections of the country, mustering
a bare majority. The Southern
states are most emphatic with 76 per
cent, West Central 60, Far West 70.

This poll staken by the Student
Opinion Surveys, however, is not
an indication that collegians want
Roosevelt for a third term. Twice

Group Studies
Folk Dancing

If the saying, “You’re only as old
as you feel,” were true, the group
of music educators and recreation
directors which has taken up
monthly folk dancing at the Win-
chester Thurston School gymna_
slum is made up of youngsters.

Meeting on the ﬁrst Saturday of
every month, the newly organized
group of 25 is made up of members
of the faculty of the University, of
Carnegie Tech, and of the Pitts-
burgh public schools.

Representing the University are
Dr. Elizabeth Rearick, associate pro-
fessor, and Charles Radi, instructor
of physical education. Mrs. J. A.
Evanson, lecturer in English, also
is a member.

The group was formed by J. A.
Evanson, a supervisor of music for
the Pittsburgh board of education.

Recluse Wills
Part of Estate
To University

Major portion of the $100,000
estate of Miss Frances F. Helmold,

98-year-old Pittsburgh recluse, who ’

died December 19 after living apart

from active life for more than half a ,

century, will be divided this year
among three city institutions in-
cluding the University, according to
the terms of her will,

Miss, Helmold, who lived alone
with her German maid in a 14-room
residence at 1507 Boulevard of All-'
lies, directed that after approxi-
mately $20,000 in bequests to friends
and relatives have been satisﬁed,

. her estate should be divided equally

among the Salvation army, the
Young lVIen’s Christian association,
and the University.

Each of the three legatee institu-

tions has been directed to add its_

share of Miss Helmold’s money‘ to

its permanent endowment through‘

establishment of an Otto Helmold
m_emorial fund in memory of her
late father, once prominent Pitts-j
burgh business man.

U niversity Student Enters Four
Winners in Pigeon Competition

Although he has been raising
homing pigeons less than a year,
Arthur Thompson, C43, had four of
his 50 birds win prizes in the recent
Greater Pittsburgh Young Bird
races sponsored by the American
Racing Pigeon union.

Thompson received four diplomas,
two for ﬁrst places and two for
fourth places. His birds also won
the junior average speed award in
the Brookline Invitation club com-
petition.

To enter races the pigeons must
be shipped by rail to various sta-
tions. When released each pigeon
flies from 100 to 1,000 miles directly
to the home of his owner.

Several theories have been set
forth to explain why the pigeons
always travel directly to their re-
spective homes. According to
Thompson, the most reliable one is
that the pigeon has in its inner ear
special canals which enable it to
detect the radio waves. This theory
is bolstered by the fact that pigeons
usually lose their way when flying
past radio stations.

Thompson expects to send three
of his birds this year to the classic
Chattanooga race, known as the
Kentucky Derby of the pigeon races.

Dr. F. W. Volkwein, a graduate of
the School of Medicine, and Thomp-
son are co-owners of the Tee—Vee
Loft, located at Bridgeville, Pa.

A SIMPLE err or
anasomna

If the University were to announce that all student publi-
cations cease, the student. body would be quick to rise and
protest. Student publications here at Pitt, just as anywhere
in America, are dependent on the students themselves. They

must edit, they read and they support.

The success of student publications, "financially, direct-
ly depends upon the students. The money paid by the stu-
dent for his copies is triﬂing compared to the cost of running

the individual magazine or newspaper.

source of revenue comes from advertising, national and local.

Local merchants are always willing and ready to adver-
tise as long as they feel their advertisements are being ob-
served, and acted upon. Why not make it a habit of reading
tile advertising sections of your publications, as well as look-
ing into the services and products of the advertiser? If
their products and Services are inferior, tell us

are satisfactory, patronize them.

After all, these merchant-advertisers enable the editors

of your publications to give you better publications.
