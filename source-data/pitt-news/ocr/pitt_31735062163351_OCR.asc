Four-Man   Team Joins t i
Insulin Protein Chains   

_ By PAT POLLINO

* Dr. Panayotis G. Katsoyannis, associate professor of bio- ‘
, chemistry in the University’s School of Medicine, told a press '
_  "conference audience Monday how he and his three-man re-
' search team produced insulinpactivity for the ﬁrst time -in a
laboratory using chemically synthesized compounds.. ‘ '

A Greek—born naturalized American citizen, Dr. Katsoy-
annis has devoted ﬁve years’ research to ‘synthesizing insu-
lin. _His ‘research team includes Andrew Tometsko, an Amer-
ican graduate. student; Dr. _Kouhei Fukuda, a Japanese post-
doctoral \fellow, and Dr. Manohar Tilak. _

“We cannot say that this is insulin, by chemical and
biological criteria,” said‘ Dr. Katsoyannis.

Must Purify One Chain _

He explained one of two chains in the. protein structure . .
Inustbe puriﬁed in its isolation state before true insulin
can be realized. . V '

“The ‘protein structure of insulin is constituted

by two chains,” said Dr. Katsoyannis, “‘linked to-

gether by two—sulphur atom bridges.” A
_ The chains, noted Dr. Katsoyannis, are insulin-A which
Andrew ~. contains 21 amino acids and insulin—B which contains 30. In 7"

addition tothe two linking sulphur atom bridges, there is a a

bridge‘ within the/insulin"-A chain. c

other side . .’ . is the propaganda stunt used by the Pennsyl-
vania Committee for HighertEducation Loan Plan. The com-
mittee hopes to “advance the cause of higher education” by
establishing a. student loan plan through ‘funds already ap-
propriated but not yet legislated into this channel. "
The loan plan, similar to plans in other states‘, would
allow a resident student to borrow up to one/thousand dollars
a year, borrowing as much as ﬁve thousand dollars. Provid-
ing‘ the bill is passed in the November election, thereywould
also ‘be room for the further legislation of apscholarship plan.
Jack Critchﬁeld, director of student aid, pointed ‘out that
though the University loaned money through National De-
fense Loan and its own sources to over one thousand stu-
dents, that abbut ﬁve hundred additional students were’re-
fused aid because of insufficient funds. Basedion these sta-

tistics for 1963-64, he added that thereis still a need for one '

million dollars, .twice the amount presently available.

(‘News’) Receives First Class
Award For Winter‘ Trimester

The Pitt News has recently received a “First class” rating
from the Associated Collegiate Press, a national critical ser-
viceﬂfor college newspapers. A

The rating is for The Pitt News of the past winter tri-
mester. The newspaper was judged in comparison with col-
1986 newspapers of other schools with approximately" the
same enrollment, same publishing’processes, and same fre-
quency, of publication. A _

M In reference to the rating, Editor Matthew

Swetonic said: “The Pitt News is extremely proud of

the rating we received from the ACP and we'll

continue to try to live up to the high standard which

which has been maintained in the past.”

Th e ACP will hold its a n n u al newspaper conference
tomorrow, Friday, and Saturday in New York City. Members

/of the organization from across the country will participate
in the convention. . .

Eighteen members of The Pitt News, will make the trip

to New York. Ten of the eighteen are from the editorial staﬁ

" of -Tl;,e,P1'.tt "News with the remainder coming from the busi-

:_—,St¥’=1ff_. Twelve other University students, from. various
ns, will also attend the tconference. -  » » ‘ - i

joining the two’ chains,”’said Dr. Katsoyannis.
Using «air.-oxydattion to synthesize the two

chains, the research team first isolated" and frag-

mented insulin-A chain. They then combined syn-

thetic-A‘with insulin-B chain (natural) and obtained

an insulin yield of about one per cent, according '

to Dr. Katsoyannis. V. 1 ' ,

The 39-year-old biochemist noted an insulin yield of o  _‘
one to ten per cent could be expected if insulin-A chain '
and insulin-B chain (both naturals) were combined.

' When the research-team attempted to fragment insulin-B
chain and proceed as was done with fragmented insulin-A,
we found a“prob_lem‘in trying to isolate B and received a slow
yield. ’

By MATTHEW NESVISKY

Isaac B a s h e v i s Singer’s
‘most recent novel, The Slave
(Farrar, Straus, Cudahy, 311
pages, $4.95), is several liter-
ary delights at once: it is vivid
historical drama, rich folk-

V, lore, pertinent_religious probing
and allegory most timely for the ,

20th Century man. ’
Translated from the Yiddish by
the author and Cecil Hemley, this
novel has many of the same quali-
ties_ of Singer’s other increasingly
popular novels and short story col-
lections. The new novel is diﬁ’er-

 ent, however, in that its story is

intensely personal
life.
' As historical fiction. the book is
“set in a place and time virtually
.untouched by recent pens: 17th
,Century Poland. We are introduc-
ed to the title character, Jacob,
four years after the infamous,
blood-spattered Ukrainian po-
groms of that era. Jacob is one of
"the few Jews of his village who
had been spared by Fortune.

Is Death Better?

For these four years, Jacob
wonders if death would have been
better than his present«life_. Hav-
gingvﬂed the Cossacks, he had been
captured by Polish robbers and
sold as a slave in the mountain

and true-to-4

country. Conﬁned to a pile of-

straw on a mountaintop, cut’ off
from his own people andrtaunted
by the neighboring peasants, Jacob

- quietly tends his master’s cattle.

A scholarly man with a gentle na-
turé, he outwardly appears to ac-
cept his ‘fate; inwardly, he is a
couldron of emotion. ~
Jacob’s problems are numer-
ous. A religious man, he does
his best to observe the customs
and traditions of his faith, but
cannot help but wonder about
the God who has thrust him into
such an isolated, lonely life.
Jacob is repelled by the ‘ignor-
. ance and_ filth of the mountain
peasants’ life and, since he can-
not eat their food, subsists on a
" scant diet of vegetables. To keep
this mind and his identity, he
~ busies himself by carving the
ancient laws on rocks.
And Jacob is a man, a social
being, a human being. He is fur-
ther tormented by Wanda. his

master’s daughter, who- comes to’
-~ the mountain each afternoon to

bring him bread and carry the
cows’ milk down ‘to the village.
iWanda makes it clear that she is
in love with the tall, bearded,
mysterious stranger whom the vil-
lagers call, Jew. -

Added Torture
This is only added torture for
Jacob. Wanda is a peasant, an out-
sider, and therefore unclean. To
have anything to do with her is

The Slave Farrar

forbidden. In addition, ‘Jacob left
a wife in his own community; he
knows that thé Cossacks have
probably raped her, ripped open
her belly and sewn alive cat in-
side, as was the custom, but for
all he knows, she may have escap-
ed and still be alive. The uncer-
tainty only compounds his misery.
As Jacob refuses Wandafs ad-'
’vances, her love‘ increases. He
is so different from the men in
her village; although a strong
man he is gentle and quiet, con-
cerned only with cleanliness and
the laws of his strange God of
love and morality. She knows
there is something good about
this strange man and forsakes
all else to have him.

Jacob ﬁnally yields to her,
drenched with guilt and accepting
his damnation. Out of the torment
of his sin, he decided that he can
no longerbe aslave; he wants to
begin a new life with Wanda.

Jacob ﬁnds a way to take Wanda’
away to a far village, pretending
that she is his wife. He gives her
the name Sarah, signifying the
convert and ‘tries to * instruct her
in the language and laws of his
people. Although she is a willing
student. Jacob knows that it i_s of
little use; she is steeped»in the
superstitions of ‘her peasant peo-
ple, victims of witches, nature
gods and black magic. Further,
Jacob knows that her speech will
immediately give her away as an
outsider; thus, ‘she must play the
part of a mute. '

A New Life ,.

Jacob attempts to make a life
as a teacher in the new commu-
nity, but he knows that his mas-
querade will not last long. He is
fooling nobody, he feels, partic-

ularly Good. Guilt and fear are his

constant companions, peace his"

ever-evasive quarry.

Jacob is not allowed to have
the things he wants in life. Torn
between the pressures of the God
he knows is true and his strange,
17th Century society he knows is
false, Jacob becomes a classic but
realistic seeker for the clear mind,
the proper path, theright way to
live. A

Author Singer has done a re-
markable job of giving breath to
an individual in the dark era of
peasant Europe, a time in which
we tend to forget that individuals
could exist. And Jacob’s story is
a powerful allegory for our own
time: once again, one wonders if
the individual can exist.

He emphasized that research is
continuing to achieve a greater
purity of the fragmented B chain.
After this is realized, a recom-
.bination with the A chain will be
made. If the activity yield pro-
duced from the recombination ap-
proximates that of the natural
chains, the result‘ will be true syn-
thetic insulin. .

1 “Why make synthetic insulin?”

D1‘. Katsoyannis was asked.

A —It would represent _the first
time man has completely synthe-
sized a protein, one of the basic
building blocks of all living
matter.

-—With, a (synthetic molecule,
scientists would be able to make
analogs (variations in the mole-
cule) to see if_ they could pro-
duce a type of insulin with
more desirable therapeutic ef-
fects. ‘

—It would make possible the
incorporation or radio-active ' ele-
. ments as integral parts of a mole-
cule of insulin and thus might
enable. scientists to better trace
the hormone in the body.

The latter could be helpful in
the search for the, basic cause of
diabetes, according to Dr. Katso-
yannis. ' '

Dr. Katsoyannis joined the
University. staff in 1958 and
began hiswork on insulin syn-
thesis the following year. He

Positive Diplomacy

The President’s decision to sell wheat to the
- Communist Bloc nations is based on a real choice
in American Foreign Policy. This;-is the choice of
what I would term “positive diplomacy.” Positive
diplomacy is the attempt to
temper. the intensity of your
enemy’s wrath, . entwine‘ him
with a series of economic, po-
litical, and social ties, and
work ‘to modify his perceived
self-interest. This is an acti-
vist diplomacy, one that re-
quires no small degree of luck
for success. Its rewards are
potentially a reduction in‘ ten-
sion between states, a modiﬁ-
cation in “spheres of interest,”
\ and the construction of a base of common interest
— thejronlyfoundation on which rapprochements,
and eventually peace, can be built. ' «
The Kennedy administration practiced the art
of positive diplomacy when it agreed to sell sur-
plus foodstuffs to the Communists. It did so in
‘the correct‘ belief that the surplus ‘wheat in itself
is not-a threat to ourisecurity andwould increase
the ties between the Westvand East. The admini-
stration’ followedethe general policy reﬂected in

our cultural exchange programs with the East, the-

Moscow -7 Washington Hot. Line, the ,Test - Ban

. ‘ Treaty, and the agreement to prohibit nuclear

testing space. However, there was anothervchoice
left open to the administration: “negative
diplomacy.” _ -
'Sl'omach' Theory 4 :
_ Negative diplomacy follows the -oft-heard line
V that “iffood, was withheld, tensions [in the totali-
wtarian ‘regimes would reach‘ the breaking point,

-. and the people of these countries would drop their

support of‘ the government.” This is a variation
onthe ,“stomach” theoryﬂof Communism, with a

-‘reverse twist; there regimes which are presently

Communist, and have ‘empty stomachs, will col-
_lapse. This is contrasted 1 with governments

 

 

_|mpro'vi_ng ‘What’ We Have  .

  Rebuilding the Old

struggling against Communism, that have empty
stomachs, which go Communist. The stomach
theory, like the proverbial army which suffered
from the same condition, makes little headway by
crawling on its belly.

Today there are other means for maintaining
discipline in a totalitarian system —- and they are
all implied by the name totalitarian itself. Terror
is the most widely practiced; it has kept unpopu-
lar V governments‘ (Salazar,, Franco, Stalin) in
power for many years. Scapegoating is.another
method; Hitler was the acknowledged master of
this technique. In short, there is a myriad of
_ways that totalitarian governments, though starv-
ing, manage to survive — and even prosper.

Choices Still Remain ' ;‘ , . .

Theineigative diplomacy of “starve ’em to riot-
'ing” leaves still another gap: what do you (the
U. S.) do when the people start to. riot? Send
words of encouragement? Send troops? Call the
U. N. into session? Again, negative diplomacy
leaves us swamped with‘ difficult choices to make
and questions unanswered.

Positive diplomacy, the involvement in, rather
than isolation from, mutual problems, can lead to
a far better set ofalternatives and consequences.
After all, this is really what statesman play: a
game of alternatives and consequences that is
complex» anddifﬁcult. Positive diplomacy would
aim for an agreement on the “Moon Race” that
would permit-the United S't‘ates~and Soviet Union
to combine their efforts and resources into one
project. '

Positive diplomacy can lead to the drawing ‘to-
gether of East and West. The opposite policy of

“ negative diplomacy would have us drift farther

apart, tear open scars and wounds just beginning
to heal, and literally pull ‘the world apart. This
policy oﬂers no hope for mankind, save that of
more hatred. If the sale of wheat to the Soviet
Blocvis handled successfully and without distor-
tion, by the Soviets, another step will have been
taken toward a better world.

The University -spends enormous sums of
money on new buildings.’ A Van der Graaf gen-
erator -is under. construction near Zliingineering
.Hall,. A new Chemistry building issupposed to
‘be started by 1965. The Frick Fine Arts Build-

ing is under eonstruction. The
Athletic Department is build ,
ing' a newt plant. Then there
are "the NASA buildings. . _

But‘ -what . about the build-
ings that have already been
completed? Although most of
the buildings‘ ~at,the University
are well planned and‘ well
maintained, there are areas in
which the present buildings’
could be improved.

‘The library at the Univer‘- ,
sity is functional,l‘and about as quiet as‘

   

can be

expected. a It is easily accessible, the chairs .are

comfortable, and it is well lit. A .

The lecture rooms in Clapp and Langley Halls V

are comfortable, fairly well planned acoustically,

and well lit.'- The same is true for the classrooms _

in both buildings. The laboratories in Clapp Hall
are at least adequate "for what they are designed
for, freshman Chemistry, and the biological Sci-
ences. They are fairly spacious, vented, and well
lit. ‘ l ' ’ '
No} Tr'uein‘ Other cases . ..

This is not true of Alumni Hall, the building
on the ,hill that smells like it has an. open sewer
in the ‘basement. The fumes in the chemistry
building are unbearable. A

This is probably one of the reasons the chem-
istry department would like a new building. But’
tjhereare far more important reasons. ‘ 3

The laboratories, especially the organic labs,
are dark, crowded, and dangerous.

Most" of the rooms in Alumni hall don’t even

have ﬂuorescent lighting, which, according to the «C

_West‘.Penn_ Power Company, could increase light
by as much as 40 percent. ‘

The equipment drawers for organic chemistry
and elementary analysis are badly overcrowded.
This results in »a tremendous amount of breakage.
It is not unusual, for a.student to spend as much
as six or seven dollars a term for broken
equipment. _, - i

From personal experience, most of this.break-

..age, seems" to occur at the beginning and end of _
iod,+ when .stu,d'en_ts"are._.trying,V_ito,,some,how F

replace the various test tubes, vials, funnels, and
. cylinders in the drawer that they took themlfrom.

Aside from being ‘dark and crowded, the or-
ganic labs are _dangerous. There are no exhaust
hoods there.

‘ Jay Sommers, graduate student in chemistry,
and an organic lab instructor, said, “It is very
dangerous for" those kids to work in there without
hoods. Any gases" given oifby the experimental
reactions go right into the air they breathe. With

hoods? installed in the labs, there wouldn’t be c

this problem.” -

Sfeneh So Strong

The stench from the organic labs has been so
strong at times that it has caused mild distress in
other labs. <Jim Wells, who like Sommers, is a
graduate student and a lab instructor in element-
ary analysis. explained, “The "smell from the or-
ganic labs became so bad at one time that it
started bothering my students, who are down the
hall from the organic labs. It got so bad that I
had to close the doors  . I don’t know how the
students in the organic labs can stand it.”

The dangers involved with experiments in-
volving. poisonous gases. are obvious from-nthe
above. ' It may be unfeasible at this time for the
University to install new hoods in thedlabs, but
they could at_ least install newer, 'more efficient
exhaust fans. With the millions being spent on
construction, at least a few more hundreds could
be i spent on maintenance.

, More /money could also be. spent to improve
the Commons‘ Room in the Cathedral. The room
is used for study by many commuting students.
Study requires light. The Commons room doesn’t
have enough of it. . ' - .

If the present lights in the Commons room
could be lowered to a height of about eight feet,
there would be approximately four times the
am0uY1’C Of light. cast on any given table.

Fluorescent lighting could be installed in the
room. but it wouldbe out of ‘harmony with the
Gothic effect. _

There are other minor improvements‘ that
could be made in the University plant . . . a more
attractive hallway in the basement of" the cathe-
dral leading to the library . . . a waxed ﬂoor in

A Martha vs.il\/lartha F eature’s
 Saturday Tilt at West Virginia

By BOB SMIZIK _

The ﬁerce rivalry that has existed between the Panther
gridders and West Virginia ever since the series between
the two teams began in 1895 will be enhanced Saturday
when the two squads meet at Morgantown for the 56th time.
V Two brothers — Paul and Richie Martha —- will be on
‘opposite-sides‘ of the ﬁeld.‘ Paul needs little introduction.
He-’s the Panthers’ starting left halfback, the team’s leading
ground gainer an an all-American candidate. '

Kid brother Rickie, a second unit halfback‘ for West.
Virginia, has played good ball so far this season. After three
games he had a better than six yard rushing average and had
returned four punts for 55 yards to lead the Mountaineers

inthat department.
’ Anxious Parents
Two people certain to be on

the edge of their seats during the
A game are Mrfand Mrs. Albert
2 .Martha, parents of‘ the two half-
 backs:

Like a typical mother Mrs.
Dorothy Martha refused to ex-
press sentiment for either team.
“We’re just very proud that both
Boys have "come as far as they «
have,” she said. “I hope they
both play a very ﬁne game. ,

“One thing is for certain.” she
continued, “we’ll have .a winner
no matter which team ‘wins!’

Coach John Michelosen is hope-
ful that the Marthas will have a
Panther winner. Michelosen feels

, that his team has a lot to get even

for. The Mountaineers have .won
the last two games played and
both times they were underdogs.
In 1961 they won 20-6 and last

‘ year they were victorious, 15-8. '

Upsets have been the tradition
which . shows the

-‘ The Panthers are now ranked
third in the nation, "by United
Press International, behind Texas
and Wisconsin, which makes them
all the more ripe for an upset.
In an effort to avoid another
upset the Panthers should be in
'top physical condition. The
only doubtful is fullback John
Teleskys How ever, Telesky
should be ready to go Saturday.
Right end Bob Long, out since
ipre-season practice with a bad

» knee, has been working out with

the team recently- and there is
an outside chance that he may,

see action against West Virginia.
The ends will be A1 Grigaliunas
and Joe Kuzneski, _the tackles
Ernie Borghetti and ‘John Maczu-
zak, the guards Jeff Ware and Ed
Adamchik and the "center Chuck
Ahlborn.

The backﬁeld will have Fred
Mazurek at quarterback, Paul
Martha and Bill Bodle at half-
back and Rick Leeson at full-
back.

An added incentive for the Pan-
thers is the chance they have to
move up in the ratings. First rank-

Jerry _ Yost Sparks West Virginia

By MARVIN ZELKOWITZ

Quarterback Jerry Yost
leads the‘ sporadic West Vir-
ginia Mountaineers against
the Panthers Saturday after-
noon at Mountaineer ﬁeld in
Morgantown.

The Mountaineers’ f 0 r t u n e s
this year seem to rise and fall on
Yost’s throwing arm. In the two
games the West Virginians have
won this year, against Boston
University 34-0, and against Wil-
liam & Mary, 20-16, Yost has

scored two more.

Against Oregon State and Navy,
Yost fwas inept, at best. The
Mounties scored ‘only one touch-
down in both games. They lost

35-O. . .
Overall, the West Virginia de-

' fense has yielded 102 points, while

the Mountaineer 0 f f e n's e has
scored 61. I
The Mountaineer pass defense

JERRY VYOS

has enough holes in it to pass
for swiss cheese. It has already
yielded 656 yards, and inter-

cepted four passes.

Despite West Virginia’s 292.

yards passing, Mountie quarter'-
backs have already had six passes
intercepted.
Goimarac Leads L_ine
Aside - from West Virginia’s
quarterbacking, the Panthers will
have to contain the Mountaineer’s
All -_ American center - candidate,
Pete Goimarac. According to his
coach, Gene Corum, “Goimarac
can be as good as he wants to be.
In ‘addition to strong indi-
/vidualgbacks, the Mountaineers
have the best place kicker in
their gridiron history, Chuck
Kinder. In his first varsity
ﬁeld goal attempt, he .set "a new
Mountaineer ﬁeld—goal-‘distance- .
kicking record, 47 yards. I
Kinder also punts for West
Virginia, and is averaging 39
yards per kick. ' _
1 Unlike the past two years, the
Panthers are not taking this game
lightly. They did last year, and
lost 16-8, and they did two years
ago and lost, 20-6. ‘ ,
