outside of classes. A mixer leader
will introduce novelty dances so
that each girl will become ac-
quainted with several men.

The dances will be at the Ma-
sonic Temple from 3 to 5:30 p.m.
Music will be furnished by the
noted Pittsburgh disc-jockey Leo
Baldizar; the latest dance tunes by
popular bands will be played.

A short intermission program
will be arranged for each dance
with free refreshments served.

Every freshman student will re-
ceive an invitation to one of the
dances either through upper.;lass

the ﬁfth hour.

In Hotel Schenley Ballroom

This is leap year and the girls
are getting their bids in early for
the men of their choice at the an-
nual Heart Hop tonight in Schen-
ley Ballroom.

Heart Hop all started years ago
when a date bureau was set up
for the girls to choose blind date
“dream men" for their partners
at the dance.

It now has become a tradition
at Pitt with the girls doing the
asking, paying and courting for
the evening. -

Jimmy Spitalny‘s orchestra will
play for the dancers.

With him will be vocal star
Marjorie King, the Spitalny “Sax—
tette,” Jackie and the Drums, and
Hershy and his Singing Trumpet.

Jimmy is carrying on the family
tradition of musicians. His father,
Maurice, is director of the KDKA
staff orchestra. His Uncle Phil
leads the All-Girl Hour of Charm,
and his Uncle Leo is one of NBC’s
music directors.

Pitt’s own Hemi - demi - semi -
quavers will quaver in their _own
particular style at the dance to
add local talent. Intermission will
provide clever comedy numbers
from the orchestra and the “Quay-
ers” worked around the “heart”
theme.

Decorations also will be on the
“heart” theme with huge valen-
tines and queens of hearts.

Tickets are $3.25, including tax.
They may be purchased from rep-
resentatives of the women’s class-
es or at the Student Desk on the
ground ﬂoor.

Industry Scans

Senior Crop
For Personnel

More than one hundred indus-
tial concerns will send personnel
representatives to Pitt to inter-
view the 465 graduating seniors
registered at the University’s
placement bureau. Another hun-
dred companies will contact Mr.
Charles H. Ebert Jr., director of
student placement, to employ stu-
dents. _

Two hundred and ﬁfty of the
registered graduating students are
technically trained. The others are
business administration and liber-
al arts students.

To be interviewed by these pro-
spective employers students must

Papers Reveal
Athletic Report

Chancellor Gets
Official Report
This Morning

A downtown newspaper yester-
day stated generalities and notes
which it constituted to be the ac-
tual report of the Athletic Com-
mittce’s deliberations extending
over a period of some four months.

From ofﬁcial quarters of the
University, no comment on the
football story was forthcoming.
The actual posting of the report is
expected to come about today or
early next week.

George Lynn, president of Stu-
dent Congress, stated on notifica-
tion of the premature speculation
of the paper, that “if we had made
a report of this nature, the Uni-
versity, as well as the student
body, would have just cause to
wonder at what we did during the
report drafting.”

All members of the temporary
group stated that they would
maintain the existing policy of the
Athletic Committee in releasing
no information to the papers un-
til the report had been submitted.

Objects of the report and the
criticism, according to the Pitts-
burgh news shee‘; were Mike Mil-
ligan, head football coach, Jimmy
Hagan, athletic director, and a
nebulous “Officials” group.

The paper asserted that the
report criticized Milligan for
three alleged failings:

Inability to handle, discipline
and get the most out of young
football players.

Failure to cultivate and main-
tain cordial relations with dis-
trict high school coaches.

Lack of an offensive on the
gridiron.

Hagen, storm center in Pitt
athletic affairs since his ap-
pointment in 1937, is cited on
the following counts:

A too timid and cautious ap-
proach to football and athletic
affairs.

Lack of an aggressive pro-
gram to bring high school foot-
ball stars to the university.

Lining up of “suicide” sched-
ules for I‘itt’s football teams.

Failure to cultivate and main-
tain cordial relations with dis-
trict high school coaches, play-
ers, alumni and fans.

Excessive courting of
Nine schools.

Administration policy - mak-
ers are blamed for:

Lack of a clear,~realistic ath-
letic policy.

Failure to delegate clear-cut
authority and responsibility to
Hagan, Milligan and other ath-
letic ﬁgures.

Indifference to pleas of stu-
dents, alumni and Pitt rooters
for good football teams.

Oflicial statements of all con-
cerned along with the compete
edited report will appear in the

Big

Pitt News at the date of its act-
ceptance by the Athletic Commit- ’ H

tee and the University officials.

Tag Day  
For semesters immemorial we ’ve sat quiet-
ly in the editorial office content to ﬂip our

typewriter carriages over campus situations
and to ignore effectively the drivers who ap-

peared to grouse about the injustice of park- .

ing tickets they’d received from the rambling
patrolmen of the Pittsburgh Police Depart-
ment.

We’ve lounged back in our chairs and dis-
missed the cases with lethargic “Tuf’s”. The

period of passive indifference ended last Fri-

day when the blue coats tagged the cars of
two of our editors under circumstances emin-
ently questionable. pp
The cases\which happened to hit home in
the Publications Corridor may be typical of
the many that we’ve heard and thought best
to forget. Last Friday morning Schenley Plaza
was covered with an inch of ice and few were
the drivers who chipped through the coating
to ﬁnd the white line and the position of their
car in relation to it. By the early part of the
afternoon rain had melted the ice, the white
lines were embarassingly visible, and patrol.-,

rmen rushed to rid themselves of the ducats

they ’d been obliged to hoard during inclement
weather.

The spot checking on Bigelow Boulevard

across from the Cathedral is something else

again. In spite of a fading yellow line, park-
ing was permitted until ‘last Friday’s reckon-
ing. An editor’s car was singled out as an ex-
ample and he owes the law money. We ’re put-
ting a little more emotion into our “Tuf’s”

these days.

The case of illegal parking adjacent to the
University are legion. Parking space is at a
premium and there are many students who
would rather gamble on a ticket than pay for
a berth in a lot. Albeit the ofﬁcers are usually
on the side of safety and order when they dis-
tribute their greetings, there seems times when
they carry their enthusiasm to extremes.

‘The tickets of our editors will be paid
eventually but from. this day forth our sec-
tion of the public press cherishes a sincere
sympathy for the drivers who’ve been shoulder-
ing the cross. There are so many better- ways
to spend.two bucks than in helping a patrol-

man ﬁll his dailyvquota.

A Speakers Galore

Student support, unlike school spirit, is

measurable. At the least, it is calculable by

' counting noses. At most, it means the differ-

ence between red and black for the numerous
social aﬁairs of the season.

Last Thirsday, Bob Ingrim placed a pro-
gram of assemblies before Student Congress
that should ’please the most critical student.
His collection of Kermit Roosevelt, Hal Lehr-
man, and Miss Sigrid Schultz provides a very

“thorough geographical as well as political
‘program. A

The Palestine question, what to expect
from Russia, a bit of history on Nazi Ger-
many——-all indicate that the Assemblies Com-

mittee is out to get information for the stu-

dents.

Student support for the assemblies program
is all that remains on the questionable list.

iWhen the ﬁrst lecturer takes the rostrum, the
answer will be gained by counting noses.

 Cynic Cefs
Wheel
By Mike llevine

They’re telling me that spring is here. Look——
I’m laughing.

Ma Nature was kind enough to offer us a few
days of warm weather and everybodyhas to run
around blowing his top and feeling the sap seep-
ing through his limbs. If only we had a few more
level heads among us this wouldn’t happen.

Sure, it’s nice to sit in class and have a
warm breeze waft in the window. It’s right
nice to be comfortable while we all catch virus-
X. Walking on Lilly Court is fun in the bright
sunlight—-—ankle deep in soot and slush.

. Spring Fever

. In Reverse,

They‘ will tell me that spring is the season for
lovers. I’m still laughing. This kid "has been through
a few .»other romantic springtimes and I know
_what’s coming. First, there’s the Heart Hop, then
the Junior Prom, rushing dances, I.F. Ball, E & M
Dance, Panhellenic Ball, and all of them topped
off with the big spring Festival. Here’s where my
wallet takes a hearty (but romantic) kick in the
teeth.

Ah, to be young in the spring. Yak, yak.
If the fancy of any young man turns to
thoughts of that old love stuff, he is going to
have to keep those thoughts to himself. Too
affectionate behavior is frowned upon. Why,
a guy can’t even lie down on the lawn to com-
pose a. short poem.

Sure, spring is coming. When March comes in
like a lamb, he’s going to go out like a lamb.
One glance at those new-look skirts he is going
to have to blow and he might not even come in
at all. Things just won’t be the same.

Spring football practice coming up. Just
the thought of it makes me ache all over. Once
every year, my girl wants to make a. hero of
me (what girl doesn’t want to make a hero?)
and I have to try out for the football team.
So for two weks I take my lumps and get
out. It’s awful——always bruised and never sub-
sidized. ‘

The weather is warm, the sun is shining, peo-
ple are falling in love right and left; spring is
here. But, egad!! Let’s not rave about it.

Notes

//

Ted Weems, whose hit recordings of the past
year have made him one of the top box office at-
tractions in ‘the band business will ‘be bringing
his band to Pittsburgh to play at Pitt’s Junior
Prom Friday evening, Feb. 27 at the William Penn.

V Weems is the veteran maestro whose phenomenal

comeback in the past year was caused by his re-
cordings of “Heartaches” and “Mickey.”

Spike Jones and his City Slickers will pre-
sent a performance at the Syria Mosque next
Tuesday‘ evening that will no doubt cause
enough laughter to make you split a gut. Spike
started off like so many other maestros-—he
led his own school ork. From this '-he graduated
to little known drum spots on top radio shows.
In '42 he formed his own group with the idea.
of playinggnovelty stuff just for kicks, ﬁguring
to earn more laughs than money.

But was he surprised! The group won an RCA
Victor contract. Spike’s ﬁrst great hit was “Der
Fuehrer’s Face” which all of you remember. The
City‘Slickers play “all known instruments and con-
stantly devise new ones. They are a group who
dabble in orchestra curiosa that would have Sto-
kowski’s hair turning black over night. Washboards,
cowbells, bottles, ﬂint guns, auto horns, doorbells
—Spike’s boys use them all. Don’t miss the show.
If you don’t have tickets already you'd better hop
to it before there is a sell out.

A Frankie Laine, Mercury recording artist,
will make a. personal appearance here March
8. Frankie has been signed by Lenny Litman
to open his new Club Copa which was for-
merly the Villa Madrid. By the way don’t miss
Fra.nkie’s latest “But Beautiful.”

Wax Wise

Sinatra’s latest, “l’ll Make Up For Everything,”
is a dreamy love ballad sung with Frank’s sin.-
cerity and set to an elegant Stordahl background.
On the ﬂipover is “For Every Man There’s A Wom-
an” from the forthcoming pic “Casbah.” . . .
Frankie Carle’s latest is “Dreamy Lullaby” and
“Lost April” . . . Don’t miss Billy Eckstine’s
“True” and “F001 That I Am” . . . High on the

Pittsburgh popular record list is -- Darnoine’s‘ “'I‘e-L

Bold Look,

fellow of yours has the Bold Look
this spring. .

“Ah-ha,” you say, “I’m way
ahead of you. With my guy the
Bold Look is the old look. If he
gets any bolder, I’ll be afraid to
get within ten feet of ‘ him.” I
won’t argue with you there. Some
of the characters seen hereabouts
recently look as though the state
would pay a bounty if you dis-
posed of them . A

Bold Look for Men

But that's not what I mean.
This Bold Look has to do with
the world of men’s fashions, of
late somewhat neglected. This
spring the well-dressed man will
deﬁnitely be wearing a Bold Look.

Chicks, you know those “gay,
colorful, all-over”_ ties that you
so delight in picking for the boy-
friend, the ones that “set off” and
“bring out” that drab old brown
suit that he’s become addicted to,
the ones that /make him wince
and screw up his face like a
crushed prune, well——keep right
on picking. That’s the Bold Look.
Checks will be bigger, stripes will
be wider, large ﬁgures will be
«larger, and over-all patterns will
be all over. Truly, Christmas will
be every day. s -

Hats, Too

But that’s only the beginning.
Hats, too, ﬁgure in this style rev-
olution. The dictum here is that
bands will be bigger and black-
er, the better to contrast with the
new cinamon-brown color of the
crown. And, my dear, the under
side of the brim will be ‘revolt-

New Look

Th Th’ '
e mg for Spring
_ by Glenn Beymer A
In fable, ballad, and story
The New Look is now in its glory.
But newer than New, replacing the Old
You’ll now hear about the Look that is Bold.
Chicks, the word is out that is you want to be seen in the right
places by the right people with a right guy,‘ you’re going to have to
have to see that that ever-lovin’0 '

ingly off-color shade of gtm-metal
grey. Nothing to be frightened
of, I assure you. This color has
been duly registered with the Na-
tional Safety Council and all nec-

essary precautions have been tak-

en.

From the tip of the hat the Bold
Look descends to the soles of the
shoes, said shoes to include the
fuchsia and ox-blood shades so
well, received by oxen everywhere
last year. Actually, . shoes might
be called the crux of the Bold
Look. What with the women’s
platform soles and super-spike
heels it. has been downright dan-
gerous for the shrunken male in
recent years to leer up at his
lady love with anything even
closelyapproxirnating a bold look.
Not onlywill the guys now have
their own platform soles but
they’ll be ridged and——wedgies.
Once more the lordly male will
tower over the demure Gibson

-Girl. Boldness, all is boldness.

Real Contrast

To complete the ensemble the
well-dressed man will boldly dis-
play in the breast pocket of his
suit a white handkerchief dainti-
ly edged with a one-inch border
of some dark contrasting color.
The contrast, of course, makes for
boldness.

How will men react to the Bold
Look? That’s difficult to predict.
But if it’s anything like a woman’s
reaction to the same, they’ll say
“no” but they’ll appreciate it just
thevsame. -

Editor, the Pitt News:

Several months ago Student
Congress was indecisive as to
whether Henry Wallace ,would be
allowed to speak on the campus
due to the fact that he would give
a speech with a deﬁnite political
viewpoint. The question was re-
solved with Mr. Wallace speaking
in the Carnegie Music Hall.

In the issue of the Pitt News
distributed on Feb. 17, the lead
story stated that , Student Con-

Is not Mr. Roosevelt a political

I do not object to his being chos-
en as a speaker. But I do think
that the other side of the Pales-
tine question should be given a
chance to be heard. There are

,Orientation*Program

Freshmen this semester will have the advantage of a revamped
upperclass counsellor program devised by a Men’s Council com-
mittee headed by Gene Thrasher, council president.

An all day program of intense training was given the upper-
class counselors on Tuesday, Feb. 10. The program included Psy-
chological approaches and an historical presentation of the University

backgrounds.

Counsellors met their Freshmen
after the Deans’ assembly on Wed-
nesday. They met in a short ses-
sion to discuss general phases of
life at Pitt, and then went to the
Freshman Banquet and the Pitt-
Allegheny Basketball game. All
groups have had their second and
many, their third meeting.

So far the counsellors and fresh-
man have discussed school history,
organization, and customs. In the
remaining two meetings for dis-
cussion activities and fraternities
will be discussed. Counsellors an-
swer questions at any time during
the program. The groups will have
a sixth meeting at which time the
custom exam'will be given.

On the basis of the grades re-
ceived on the exam and the rec-
ognition given by upperclass coun-
sellors, Panther keys will be
awarded in a special ceremony by
the Men’s Council.

Heat Unit Has
Langley Name

Dr. Samuel P. Langley, director
of the Allegheny Observatory
from 1867 to 1391, and inventor of
the bolometer has had a unit of
measure named after him by a
recognized group of American me-
teorologists and astrophysicists.

Dr. Langley was a pioneer in
measuring the heating power of
the sun. It is the amount of solar
radiation received on one square
centimeter capable of raising the
temperature of one gram of water
of one degree centigrade, that has
been named “Langley,” or abbre-
viated, “Ly.”

Man Who Knew Him When

  Says Poet Field No Student

‘ COLUMBIA, Mo.—The eccentricities of Eugene Field, the poet
who gladdened the hearts of children with tales of sugar-plum trees,
gingerbread dogs, and lollypop seas, was recalled here by C. B. Rollins,
A who knew him as a classmate at the University of Missouri in 1870.
His third college in as many years, it is said that Field was
requested to leave the university in 1871 because neither his scholas-
tic record nor his extra-curricular activities measured up to school

standards.

Mr. Rollins remembers him as a
tall clumsy fellow who was often
seen on the campus at the crack
of dawn in full dress attire. He
had brass buttons on all his suits.

Rollins doubts whether Field
owned a textbook during his en-
tire stay at MU. He often borrow-
ed them from his friends, although
he couldn’t have had much use
for them since he rarely attended

L

 
 

classes. Field made several jaunts
to St. Louis and Chicago that last-
ed a week or more.

The man who created Little Boy
Blue, The Gingerbread Dog and
the Calico Cat, and Winken, Blyn-
ken and Nod displayed no poetic
talent while at the university, his
literary efforts being conﬁned to
short-story writing. ‘

“Clown of the Ivorier
Here with Symphony,

 

Victor Borge, the “c1own-prince of the keyboard” will make his
ﬁrst Pittsburgh appearance in an “Evening of Fun,” with the Pitts-
burgh Symphony Orchestra under the baton of Vladimir Bakaleini-

koif tonight at Syria Morque.

This concert is the ﬁrst of several beneﬁt performances for the

Pittsburgh Symphony.

Mr. Borge will play one move-
ment of the Tschaikowsky Piano
Concerto with the orchestra and
will return to play the piano alone
and provide the_ unorthodox
sketches and improvisations that
have won him fame on. radio,
stage and screen. Light popular
works, including Don Gillis’ Sym-
phony 51/2 (Symphony for Fun),
will be featured by the orchestra
under Mr. Bakaleinikoif, who will
comment on ‘;;e works to be play-
ed.

Danish-born Victor Borge be-
gan playing at 7, was a concert
prodigy at 17 and less than a year
later won European fame as a
brilliant satirist in music. Borge’s
fame in Scandinavian Countries
grew with his biting satires on
Hitler, which resulted in his be-

‘Can't Lock‘em |n'="
Says Fire Chief

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -— Profes-
sors at Harvard University have
run into trouble with the Cam-
bridge ﬁre department. In the past
Harvard professors have been in
the habit of locking classroom
doors after the lecture begins, to
discourage late-comers.

Now the Cambridge ﬁre chief
has ruled that this practice is il-
legal unless the class room doors
are equipped with panic bars.

He has instructed the faculty
members to cease the “locked-
door” policy and it appears that
Harvard professors will have to
ﬁnd some other methods of dis-
couraging tardy students.

Ballermal

Next Stop on His LongComeba’ick Road

Ted Weems, one of the few band leaders who has been able to
hold a high rating in the musical world over a period of years,
will present his famous orchestra at the Junior Prom, “Ballerina
Whirl” in the Main Ballroom of the William Penn Hotel on Feb. 27.

Famous for his “businessman’s bounce” /which brought him
fame in “Heartaches,” a 1923 revival, Weems will come direct from
a tour which includes appearances at the Waldorf-Astoria, Palmer

House and Meadowbrook Country’

Club.
Featuring a lively, bouncing

style with a catchy whistliiig
chorus rather than jive tunes,
Weems will present a program
ideally suited for dancing.

Having introduced such pres-
ent-day stars as Perry Como and
Marilyn Maxwell, Weems is
justly famous for his ability in
discovering .. talent.

His present group features vo-
calists Shirley ‘Richards and Bob
Edwards, Elmo Tanner. a whist-
ling sensation, and soloists Billy
Blair and Glenn Martin.

Although he is best known as

a musician and leader, Weems is
also noted as a composer, having
written such pieces as “Jig Time,”
“Egyptianella,” and “Martins and
the Coys.” \

Weems, a former resident of
this city, is remembered by some
Pittsburghers for his association
with the “Mason-Dixon Seven,”
the band with which he made his
first professional engagement.

Lee Kelton and his orchestra
will play in the Urban Room to
take care of the expected over-
ﬂow crowd.

Dance time is is 9 p. m.. to 1
a. m. and tickets are now on sale
for $4, including tax. The price at

the door will be $4.50.

FINANCING

Gavolf keeps stepping back and let-
ting the girl come forward, until,
in her eagerness, she falls on her
face——to put it politely}? —

According to this article, there
are three types of wolflike ap-
proaches. Uncertainty is one of
his chief weapons. He tells the
girl he will call sometime, then
lets her sweat it out for a few
weeks, wondering why he hasn’t
phoned. 

The second strategyconsists of
telling the girl that he “doesn’t
like casual affairs.” Miss Moats is
very cynical about this. “You may
he certain that these are all he
does like,” she says ﬁrmly.

The third type of wolf con-
ﬁdes that he has been terribly
hurt by a woman. This is a wolf
call as recognizable as the ﬁrst
ner.” » /
When the wolf ﬁnally slips out
of your life either through an en-
gineered quarrel or a gradual dis-
appearance, you can console your-
self that you will not be forgot-

,cludes. When he starts to work
on your successor, you will live
on as the woman who hurt him.

practicable the weaving of nylon into
textiles, it was necessary to develop
an entirely new slasher sizing material

here to one another, protect the yarn
from abrasion and keep it clean. Sizes
used on other ﬁbers proved unsatisfac-
tory on nylon, because of its unique

Five candidates were exhaustively
tested by Du Pont men. Best by far

to hydrogen bonding with the polya-
mide structure of nylon.

Many technical problems involved

moved by water. PMA dissolves in
water readily up to 10 % at room tem-

precipitation at the normal scouring

In the IF Bowling League, the
regular season is over; but only
one thing has been decided.
PiKA’s are champs! The next ﬁve
positions are anybody’s race.

Cause, of this confusion is the
mid-semester vacation g a m e s

“scheduled, but unplayed. Thus,
unplayed games will be rolled off
within the next two weeks and
ﬁnal standings will be decided.
Contenders include Sammies, Phi
Eps, Theta Chi, Phi Gains, and
Delts.

, In the last regular week of
bowling, the PiKA’s contin ed
their great pace by taking thr e
from the PiLams. In an import-
ant game, Pro Phater and Tony
Clement led Theta Chi to two
triumphs over the Phi Eps.

The Sammies showed great
power in ruining the Phi Gams,
meanwhile tightening their grasp
on second place. The Delts beat
Alpha Phi Delta three straight to
move into third. However, they
‘have nine more games to play.

In other less important games,
Lambda Chi took two from the

Swimmers Shooting for First 
Undefeated Year Since 1934

By Rob Van Atta

The ‘Panther swimming team, striving for its ﬁrst unde-
feated season since 1934, is favored over Penn State’s natators
tomorrow night at the YMHA pool at 8:15.

Just 12 Saturdays have elapsed since the Nittany Lion
football team climaxed an unbeaten campaign witha triumph

over a Pitt team showing but:

one victory.

Tomorrow, it’s the State College
team with one victory, an unscath-
ed Panther array, and the sea-
son’s climax in another sport. The
visitors have trounced Dickinson,
54-21, and lost to Syracuse, 43-32.

The David-Elkins meet Wed-'

nesday will be strictly an anti-
climax. The favored Pitts an-
nounce that three all-time Uni-
versity swimmingrecords are in
danger in the State meet.

Under ﬁre are the 50-yard free
style mark of 24.5 seconds set
jointly by Walt Nowotney in 1938
and Dick Petro this Year, Petro’s
recently established 54.7 second
standard in the 100, and the 400-
yard relay time of three minutes,
43.6 seconds.

Ben Grady’s current relay team
of Paul Brugger, Don Wilde, Cap-
tain Walt Jackson, and Petro has
come within eight seconds of the
10-year-old mark set by Beacon,
Milt Leiderstein, Slobodian, and
Nowotney.

Penn State’s strongest opposi-
tion is expected in the free style
events and, fancy diving, with the
latter the only serious threat as
the Panthers hope to better last
year’s 46-29 score.
