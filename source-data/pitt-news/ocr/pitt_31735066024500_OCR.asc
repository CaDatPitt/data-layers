Faculty debates   athletes ’
class attendance policy

By Gary Knapick
sta1rWmer'

The proposal to require student
athletes to sign class—attendance

’ cards was debated at yesterday’s

University Senate Faculty
Assembly meeting.
Senate athletics committee chair
Nathan Hershey submitted’ for
the approval of the assembly a
new set of academic-eligibility
criteria for athletes. The criteria
‘mandate that first—yea.r and
academically troubled athletes
have class—attendance cards
signed weekly by their instructors,
and the policy drew varied
criticism from the faculty.
Hershey, who said that Pitt’s
academic-eligibility requirements
are more stringent than those of
the NCAA, said that increased
attendance should improve

academic performance. Hershey
also added that poor academic
performance has been shown to
be detrimental to an athlete’s
performance on the playing field.

Faculty Assembly member
David Pratt said the mandatory

. class—attendance requirement

“prolongs emotional maturity“
and said he was against “holding
the hands of any student.”

_ Hershey defended the policy
by saying that the card system,
which was in place last semester,
fosters self-discipline in new
student athletes at Pitt and
strengthens them against the
many distractions of city life.

“I find the system totally
impractical,” said Professorjames
Holland, who said he is
approached by nearly 30 card-

waving athletes at the end of a A
4(._)0-student class. Others argued

Youngest transplant

The youngest patientrever to

the hospital is optimistic that

Rumors surrounding
blood drives untrue

By Megan B/ertino

Rumors that 80 pints of blood collected at November’s Greek,
Week blood drive were infected with the AIDS-causing HIV
virus are unfounded, according to Central Blood Bank.

CBB director of commun—ications Terri Glueck said CBB sees
about three or four cases of l-llV a year but has seen less than
80 total cases in the last six years.

Eighty infected pints of blood collected at the drive would be
“highly, highly unusual. I can’t even imagine such a scenario ‘
happening,” Glueck said.

“That is a rumor. There’s no truth to that at all,” CBB manager '
of information and counseling jean McNanee said.

McNanee refused to disclose any information about how

Professors forecast uncertain future for fallen Soviet empire

By Gary Knapick

Stag‘ Writer

The recent collapse of the Soviet Union,
perhaps one of the most dramatic and
significant events of our decade, has left’
enough questions and ‘uncertainties to
confound the best armchair political
scientists. Pitt professors see the collapse
as the result of human—rights reforms and
forecast an uncertain future for the new
republics. . '

Reform in the Soviet Union enabled
citizens to voice their long-suppressed
grievances, said Pitt Professor Janet
Chapman, who specializes in Soviet
economics. ’ ,

“Somehow [Soviet citizens] lost their

fear. The terror that was used to keep the
people in line was no longer operable,”
Chapman said.

Russian and Eastern European studies

Chair Ron Lindenisaid the movement to
dismantle the party state and the use of

open competitive elections caused the ‘

Soviet Union’s disintegration.

“People could judge the party for the
first time. [Open elections] created an
alternative source of power, which is the
parliament,” Linden said.

Since the Christmas Day resignation of
former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev,
more eyes are fixed on the democracy-
min_ded, upwardly—mobile Russian
President Boris Yeltsin.

“Many people are wondering, ‘Is he a

democrat or a demagogue?”’ Chapman
said.

“He’s president of the most powerful
successor state, and he's facing severe
economic woes,” Linden said.

‘"1 think he’s serious about the reforms.
After all, he did let the prices go,” Chapman
said. Chapman warned that Yeltsin could
create 'a‘“spiralrof inﬂation” if he allowed
wages to climb freely.

“[Yeltsinl wants more power to [install a
free—market system] than many think is
necessary or democratic. But he may need
that power to get things under control. He
can’t offend the other republics by grabbing
for everything,” Chapman said.

“He has to keep up the courage of those
who are trying to bring about these reforms.

There may be an inclination to abandon
many of the reforms,” Linden said.
“They certainly have to worry about

their food," said Chapman, who added

that the republics have to formalizelthe
laws governing commerce and relations
between the republics.

The hoarding of food illustrates the

need for such regulation. “Those who .

have it are setting up barriers to the other
republics," Chapman said. _
“The top priority has to be economic

Coping on Campus

Group counseling may be answer to relationship woes

Close to 70 percent of students
who seek help at the counseling
center are experiencing
relationship problems of some
sort. Their concerns are varied
and range from problems with
establishing and maintaining
friendships to examining the
quality of current relationships,
fromknowinghowtoendharmful
or static relationships to resolving
conflicts with parents or other
significant people. Difficulties in
relationships often result in

' considerable emotional turmoil,

stress and unhappiness for
everyone involved.

Many students who seek help
with these problems can and do
benefit from individual

~ counseling. Often, however, an

even more powerful way to
address problems in interpersonal
relationships is to join a group of
other people who are grappling
with similar issues.

areas in their lives. In addition,
group experiences have the
advantage of helping members
feel that they are not alone in
their struggle.

There are several types of
groups, each designed to meet
specific needs. Workshops are
one-session groups which aim at
providing information and
strategies for dealing with
particular problems, such as how
to initiate a relationship, how to
stop procrastinating or how to
achieve personal goals.

Theme-centered structured
groups, which meet for
approximately three to 10
sessions, provide an opportunity
for more in-depth learning and
greater exposure to different
problem-solving strategies. ‘

Such groups are usually focused
on specific topics like improving
relationships with parents, coping

‘with the end of a significant

relationship, handling public-
speaking anxiety or finding a
satisfying career direction.

Process or therapy groups are a
third way of approaching personal
problems. These groups usually
last for a full term or several
terms.

They are most beneﬁcial for
people who are interested in
gaining a deeper understanding
of themselves and of their
relationships with others.

This understanding comes as
members examine their behavior
in the group and explore how it
may be similar to their behavior
with other significant people in
their lives.

Workshops, theme groups and
process groups all provide a
friendly, non—threatening and
supportive way of learning new
interpersonal skills and of
developing more personal self-
confidence.

Q&A: Freind ‘not a one—issue Candidate’ in Senate primary

By Jenna Ferrara
News Editor

State Rep. Steve Freind (R.-
Delaware County), described as
“the point man of the pro-life
movement,” is challenging

, incumbent Sen. Arlen Specter in

the Republican primary this

- spring. Freind has called for tax

cuts and a return to “family
values.’’

Although Freind is best known
for his strong pro-life views, he
scorns the description “one-issue
legislator," pointing to his
positions against public—school
strikes and supporting school
choice and free trade. He is also
the author of a. “modestly
successful” novel about pro-life
leaders and hopes to coach junior
high football after he leaves
politics.

Freind recently attended a Pitt
College Republicans meeting,
where he distributed “No P.C.”
buttons. In a conversation after
the meeting he discussed his
political philosophy and plans.
for the primary.

The Pitt News: Are you
Worriedabout the future of
the Republican Party in the
state of Pennsylvania,"
especially in light of Sen.
Harris Wofford’s recent win
over Dick Thornburgh?

Rep. Steve Freind: The

.leadership of the state committee

has shown this tremendous
propensity for picking losers, for
moving away from the values we
believe in and moving toward
the Left. They gave us Bill

"Scranton, and they gave us

Barbara Hafer, both way out of
touch withthe average rank and
file, and then Dick Thornburgh, a
man who had been a very good
governor, but who had
demonstrated, and it was very
obvious, that he didn’t want to
run for the job. ‘
He really didn’t want to run,
didn’t want to be a senator, and
the campaign showed it. So I
think this campaign between
Specter and me is going to really
show the direction this party takes
for the next 10 or 20 years 
PN: If you are elected to the
Senate, What do you want to

accomplish?
SF: The first goal is to always
represent the people of

Pennsylvania? One of the things‘
A I want to do right away is to try to

get a handle on a level playing
field of trade between the U.S.
and other nations. And ‘God

- knows labor has never supported

me, organized labor, and I’m not
asking for special favors for the

' American worker, but they’ do

deserve a level playingfield. ’
The second thing is the

commitment to a tax cut. We

have to get people working again.
You cut taxes, you pump up the
economy  How did we beat
communism? We didn’t beat
communism through the
hydrogen bombs, for God’s sake
 We whipped them through the
free-market system; and they
finally realized they couldn’t
compete.

PN: You were re-elected to
the state legislature"in 1990.
How close was the margin of

victory?

SF: Oh, it was a blowout! It was
very close, 51 to 49 percent. I was
the No. 1 national target of the
pro-abortion forces, the No. 1
state—wide target of organized
labor, the No. 1 statewide target
of the teachers’ unions.

Every spending record in the
history of the commonwealth of
Pennsylvania was broken. They
dumped over half a million dollars

' against me. They threw everything

at me but the kitchen sink  They
paid a lot of attention to me. My
life’s never been dull. But if the
thought of re-election terrifies
you, then by deﬁnition you can’t
do a good job.

PN: What are the main issues
you’re going to concentrate
on in the upcoming primary?

SF: I have two jobs. Number
one, is-define who Steve Freind is

. and then define who Arlen

Specter is, and contrast where we _

stand. What you have in Arlen
Specter is a extremely liberal
Democrat thinly disguised in
Republican’s clothing. With» me,
what you‘ see is what you get.
You have a conservative
Republican.

The Central difference,
however, is one that’s less
tangible. And it’s called trust. I
never change my message for
any group that I go to; there are
never any surprises. People
always know where I stand.

With Arlen Specter, you have a
man where everything he does

and everything he says is based
on, what can I do to get re-
elected?  There’s no question
but for the upcoming primary,
Specter would have Borked
Clarence Thomas.

PN: In your opinion what is
the constitutional reasoning
to prohibit abortion?

SF: The constitutional
reasoning? I don’t believe it’s a
constitutional issue. And what I
really find inconsistent, the court
manufactured a constitutional
right to privacy and said because
of this right to privacy, you can
have an abortion  The same
court ruled constitutional a
Georgia statute

the privacy of their own bedroom,
a crime. Where’s the privacy?
Any good lawyer  will admit

this. Roe vs. Wade, forgetting ’

what you think about abortion,
was a classic example of judicial
legislation and not interpretation.
One of the main problems I have
is with courts who want to make
the law and not interpret the law.

PN: You said the pro-life
movement needs to gain
control of the semantics used
in the abortion debate.

SF: My point is, always watch
your language. The other side
has really done a wonderful job
of getting away from the issue.
The other side has understood
that if you focus the debate strictly
on the act, the killing of an unborn

child, they can’t win. They know
that. And so you have “pro-
choice.” And we bought it.

If I said, “Well I’m personally
opposed to depriving a segment
of the population of their civil
rights, but I believe in the right to
choose,” I’d he laughed out or
stoned out of the room  let’s
say precisely what we’re talking
about. 

By_ any rational person’s
definition, abortion is the killing

. of an unborn child. No one can

dispute that. And since the child
is either torn apart or scalded to
death, it’s an inherently violent
act. No one can dispute that.

Now I agree that unwanted
pregnancy is a wrenching social
issue. But since when do we
solve our social problems with
violence and killing? I’ve never
heard a logical argument in
support of abortion.

PN: You support an
amendment allowing for
prayer in public schools and
have said students have no
opportunity to pray in school.

SF: 'l'hat’s exactly right. I’m
talking about a non-
denominational prayer to begin
school. Schools  are banned
from doing that because of the
ruling of the Supreme Court.

would represent a mingling

SF: Arlen used that argument,
on the floor of the Senate which
begins every day with a prayer by
a Senate chaplain. You can’t have
it both ways  Separation ‘of
church and state? Where did that
come from?

PN: Oh no, you’re going to
test my constitutional
knowledge?

SF: It’s not in the Constitution,
never has been.

PN: But it has been a
precedent of American
lawmaking.

SF: No, it’s the precedent of a
Supreme Court that also gave us
slavery, abortion on demand and
a host of other evils  What I
always try to do is look for logic
and consistency. You can’t pick
and choose like that.

It’s ridiculous  It ought to be
up to each school district. There
should be no denominational
prayer that really gets into, the
establishment of religion  But
look at our Pledge of Allegiance,
“One nation under God.”

This nation has always
recognized the existence of God
and the need for God’s help.
There’s' nothing wrong with that.
When we make God an enemy,
when we can’t use his name in
schools, what are we doing?

PN: What is your opinion of
Sen. Harris Wofford’s plan for
national health insurance?

  

SF: 1 don’t know what it is, do
you? He got away with_murder,
and Thornburgh let him. He
talked about pie in the sky, never
mentioned one specific like, how
you’re going to pay for it. Do I
think we have do something
creative about the problem of
health-care affordability and
availability? Yes.

PN: Can you explain your
reasoning for wanting to
exclude gays and lesbians
from the Civil Rights bill on
the grounds, ». that
[homosexuality] is a chosen
behavior?

SF: Sure.

PN: Isn’t religion, which you
believe should be acivil right,
also a chosen behavior?

SF: That’s not a choice of
conduct. That’s a belief.
Homosexual activity is a form of
conduct, as is drinking, as are
drugs, as are a host of other
things. Don't misunderstand me.
We should not persecute
homosexuals. But I don’t think
you take that course of conduct
and protect it in the Civil Rights
act and give that the same status
as race, color, religion or physical
handicap. ,

For example, do I believe a
school board has the right to say,
‘No we’re not going to hire you
because you’re homosexual, and
we don’t believe you’re a good
influence on our students’? Yeah,
I believe they have that right. Do

I believe a landlord has the right
to say, ‘No, I’m not going to give
you a room because you drink’?
I believe they have that right 
T hat’s not persecuting somebody.
Is is discriminating, yeah, but in a

broad sense. Did you vote in the

last election?

PN: Yes.

SF: Let’s say you voted for
Wofford. Then you discriminated.
To discriminate means to choose.
You discriminated for Wofford
and against Thornburgh. The fact
that you havea green blouse on
today means that you
discriminated in favor of green
and against red, yellow, et cetera.
Everything we do discriminates
 Discrimination is not always a
negative connotation, nor should
it be. What I’m saying is, that

doesn’t belong in the civil rights _

act. Particularly in view of, well,
let it go at that.

PN: N 0, what were you going
to say? , -

SF: Look, it is one of the major
reasons why we are spreading a
disease which makes the bubonic
plague look like a walk in the
park. I don’t think we should be
deifying that course of conduct.

PN: But there are other ways
the AIDS virus is spread.

SF: Sure. But that’s one of the
major ways. And one of the ways
heterosexuals are infected is

because of contact with
homosexuals.

Starzifs autobiography due this fall

By Cindy O’Leary
staﬂr Writer

Liver—transplant pioneer Dr. Thomas Starzl’s
autobiography, The Puzzle People, is due to be
published this fall. _

Starzl is director of the University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center’s Transplantation Institute and a
professor of surgery at Pitt.

Lisa Rossi, spokesperson for the Health Sciences
News Bureau, said Starzl is modest about his
own accomplishments. The book “focuses on
how Starzl and others advanced the field and
describesgcertain patients who died at the expense
of providing knowledge and valuable insights
for doctors to apply toward the future of the
field,” Rossi said.

Starzl was unavailable for comment.

The Puzzle People details Starzl’s childhood
and the inﬂuence of his parents. The son of a
newspaper publisher and a nurse, Starzl departed
from the family—owned business to pursue a
career in medicine, which eventually led to his
work in transplantation.

University Press Director Frederick Hetzel said,
“The strength of the book is that it is
understandable, informative and simultaneously
emotionally moving.”

“Starzl describes his patients with a considerable
amount of feeling and a sense of the existence of
a strong personal relationship. You can see the
influence of a communications and medical
background merging,” Hetzel said.

According to Rossi, Starzl said the time is right
to write about his experiences and

accomplishments. The book was prompted by
Starzl’s career nearing its end and by recent heart
problems he had this past year.

Starzl’s primary goal was “to share the depth of
his knowledge and experience [in the field of]
transplantation and [to show] how patients helped
contribute to the field’s advancements. After all
he was there from the beginning,” Rossi said.

In The Puzzle People, Starzl tells his own story,
along with describing the main contributions
made by other surgeons and medical researchers
in the transplantation field over the past three
decades.

Starzl performed the world’s first liver transplant
in 1963 while on the staff at the University of
Colorado School of Medicine. ‘*

Catherine Marshall, Starzl’s editor at the
University Press, said, “T om Starzl is not only a
gifted surgeon; he is a gifted writer. He describes
complex surgical procedures in clear, everyday
language. He writes modestly of his own
accomplishments, and he writes powerfully about
Stormie Jones and others whose lives he has
struggled to save.”

Until the age of 33, Starzl said he felt like a
missile looking for a trajectory. His work with
liver transplantations has given his life and
career direction, and he has pursued the
advancement of the field relentlessly, Starzl said.

Starzl’s work and dedication has made
Pittsburgh the center for transplantation surgery.
He has worked recently with the anti—rejection
drug’ FKS06, which is believed to be more
effective than present drugs and present fewer
known side effects.

SA C su rz/ey reveals staﬁét,

unhappy with sczlomes

By Rebecca Baker
For T be Pitt News

Of the 13 percent of the 5,000
Pitt staff members who responded
to a survey, most said they weren’t
being paid enough.

Salaries received the most
complaints on the
Association Council survey, with
over 400 staff members
dissatisfied with the size of their
paychecks. SAC Vice President
Jon Conlogue said most of the
staff thinks Pitt’s salaries are not
as competitive as those at other
universities. ‘

Most respondents said they
would like to be‘ paid every other
week rather than monthly.
Twenty percent singled out staff
salaries as the one feature that
the University of Pittsburgh needs
to change.

But 525 respondents said they
liked working at Pitt. Almost 80
percent said there should be
mandatory training of su pervisors,
but almost 70 percent felt their
supervisors were doing their job
well. .

News Editor

Pulitzer Prize-winning author William
Kennedy gave fans a sneak preview of his
upcoming novel at a reading Monday
night at the Fulton Theater.

Very Old Bones, due for publication this
April, chronicles another branch of the
Phelan family, which appears in five of
Kennedy’s seven novels.

The five novels about the Phelans are
referred to by Kennedy and his fans as the
“Albany cycle” because all of them are set
in Albany, New York.

Kennedy was born, raised and has spent
most of his adult life in Albany. When
asked in 1988 if V8731 Old Bones would be
set in Albany, Kennedy said, “Where else?
There is no place else.” I

I/evy Old Bones begins in July of 1958,
moves backward to 1857 and finishes on
the same July day that it started.

The story is about five adults who live
. together, to the town priest’s dismay.

I Peg and George Quinn are the elderly
couple whose house the principle
characters live in.

Annie is Peg’s very old and senile mother
who often becomes Confused and

disgruntled, refusing to eat her breakfast
because she insists her eggs are covered
with bugs instead of pepper.

Billy is George’s cousin who gambles,
drinks and finds it impossible to make a
commitment to his lover, a young woman
who lives at the Quinns to help take care
of Annie.

The title of the book takes its name from
fossils found in the town that appear to be
of a large tusked animal and a man.

- While Kennedy did not reveal the entire
plot of the novel, the ﬁve characters’ lives
become wrapped up in the mystery of the
strange bones.

Kennedy said he first created the Phelan
family in 1959 in his first novel, Angels and
the Sparrows. »

But the novel was never published.
Kennedy shrugged after revealing this
and said this was “not unusual for a first
novel.’’

He said one publisher told him, “Nobody
ever laughs in this book.”

Kennedy agreed with the publisher and
made light of the novel adding, “It’s like
life was viewed through a black veil of
doom.” .. ”

Kennedy’s most famous novel, Ironweed, _

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, January 8, 1992

Faculty  

Continuedfrom page 1_
attendance for athletes was tabled
until the next meeting of the
University Senate Faculty

g Assembly.

Susan Smith, a co-chair of the
Tenure and Academic Freedom
Committee, presented the latest
version of the senate’s conflict of
interests policy. Smith said the
policy, which has undergone 20
revisions since it was started last
September, “is as good as it’s
going to be.” ‘

The inception of the policy is
the result of pressures from the
government on
to strengthen
regulations governing potential
conflicts of interests between
university researchers and outside
sources. ..

A few assembly members
preferred a more general
statement of the conditions
surrounding unethical behavior
to the document’s list of speciﬁc
wrongdoings.

But as senate member and Pitt
law Professor Edward Symons
explained, concrete examples are
preferable to an all—encompassing
statement of policy.

“Whenever people- have
created codes of ethics, they’ve
used lists of-examples like these.
For now, this document is in the
ballpark, at least,” Symons said.

“The government is breathing
down our necks to be more
specific in these matters,” said
Assistant Provost for Research
Wilfried Daehnick.

The policy passed the assembly
by a vote of 20-4.

‘ The assembly also considered
a recommendation to set up a
committee that would investigate
a fixed-term policy for university
administrators.

The policy would limit the free
reign of deans and other
administrators by requiring
mandatory evaluations every few
years. One faculty member
compared the lengthy, unchecked
terms of current deans to those of
former Soviet leaders.

Kaufman said fixed—term rules
were eliminated under former
Pitt President Wesley Posvar, but
the present administration seems
more open to such a policy.

Other assembly members
commented that Posvar ended
the program because he feared
that it would eventually reach his

post. .

In his opening remarks,
University Senate President
Richard Tobias reported on the
status of several senate
committees and their
projects.

The installation committee is
finalizing plans for the installation
ceremony of Pitt President J.
Dennis O'Connor. The ceremony,
which will take place on Feb. 28,
will be held in the Carnegie
Museum.

The installation will be attended
by distinguished members of the
Association of American
Universities and will be followed
by a reception dinner in either
the William Pitt Union or Forbes
Quadrangle.

“It’s going to be a very large
day for the O’Connors,” Tobias
said.

can be given to make the transition
a little easier,” Linden said.
“Certainly, humanitarian aid
should be given.

“There will be a certain amount
of upheaval as people try to find
their place in the new order, and
there will certainly be economic
upheaval as new systems are put
into place,” Linden said. “The
republics are going to have to
work out a method of working
with one another.”

“If [the commonwealth of

‘ republics] collapses, there will be

problems for the world
marketplace. If it gets its act
together, which I think it
eventually will, they will be in
competition with us and
hopefully buying more from us
as well,” Chapman said.

Linden said the dissolution of
the Soviet empire will most
directly affect the lives of
Americans ‘-‘by removing the
adversary that we’ve had so long”
and the justification for the
government's enormous military
expenditures.

“The amount of resources
[directed toward the military]
should be able to shrink
significantly, and hopefully more
will be directed to the social
problems we’re experiencing at
home,” Linden said.

Chapman said that while it may
take some time to get the
commonwealth’s economy
together, the republics have the
potential to develop into a strong
economic power.

“T hey’ve' got a lot of educated
people and a lot of resources. But
they’ve got to make the market
work,” Chapman said.

The hybrid economy under
which the Soviet Union now
operates during this period of
flux cannot stand for long. “A
mixture of market and plan [often
called market socialism] may not
work,” Chapman said.

Russia, the Ukraine and the
Baltic states are likely to be the

_ most competitive republics,

according to Linden.

He said that the economic fate
of smaller, less competitive
republics is linked to that of
Russia.

Chapman said that the
republics’ transition economies
offer many opportunities for
American investors with initiative.

“It’s a big country. They need a
lot of things,” Chapman said.
“Opportunities are there, and
many [investors] may wait and
see before they ‘leap. Of course,
they may miss many of those
opportunities if they do.”

Both professors offered a
retrospective evaluation of former
Soviet president Mikhail
Gorbachev.

“He was marvelous,” Chapman
said. She said that the former
Soviet president deserved praise
for introducing glasnost and for
reforming Soviet foreign relations.

Gorbachev was a good
Communist, but Gorbachev’s ties
to the Communist Party
contributed to his ultimate
resignation, Chapman said.

“Gorbachev couldn’t stomach
going all the way to a free market.
He felt he had to keep the
conservatives happy, but he may

have bent to far to their side,”
Chapman said.

“He came to power with
intention of changing several
significant aspects of the Soviet
Union” and in the process,
unleashed the chain of events

that would eventually cause its
downfall, Linden said.

Linden said a return to
communism isn’t likely, but the
state could retain a large interest
in the economies of the republics
if the people lose patience with

the slow-moving process of
economic conversion.

Despite its failure as a social
and economic system, there is
much to learn from l,enin’s 74-
year experiment.

“[Communisml wasn't very

efficient, but you can’t say it
didn’t work. It certainly got

industry going fast,” Chapman i

said, adding that the loss of life
and personal freedom under
Soviet communism outweighed
economic benefits.

Cosmetic surgery is nothing new to millions of American

new developments show that silicone—gel breast implants

The FDA has called for a 45-day halt of the gel implants,
which have been used for the past 30 years on almost

At the end of the 45 days, a specialized panel will report

been known to rupture and leak into the bloodstreams of

1 -women who have had breast implants.

The gel can make women more susceptible to immune-

_ system disorders. . V
The FDA has never before called for a halt of an

approved medical procedure. Although the FDA deserves
applause for its action and the call for the unusual
‘moratorium, the organization should also realize that
careful experiments should have shown these damaging
effects 30 years ago, before the product became such a
popular trend. ,

The same panel that is researching the information said
in November that the FDA should keep , silicone—gel
implants on the market while they were investigating the
extent of the problem. V

Since it was recently discovered that the implants do in
fact rupture and may be linked to chronic inﬂammatory
disease, FDA Commissioner David Kessler advocated the

"halt.

Although the American Association of Plastic and
Reconstructive Surgeons agrees with the FDA, the American
Medical Association does not. A member of the AMA
Council on Scientific Affairs, Dr. Mitchell S. Karlan, said
there is no evidence of silicone implants being linked to
cancer. Sharing the AMA opinion is Bonnie Campbell, the-
president of My Image After Breast Cancer, a Washington-
based organization.

Campbell said she believes that a recall of the silicone-
gel implants would cause “unnecessary fear, insurance

' nightmares and a feeding frenzy of litigation.”

But if this were true, the FDA would not have called for
such a sudden moratorium.

According to 7790 Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, “The FDA has
received about 3/00 reports of problems with silicone gel
breast implants.” ’l'hese problems range from discomfort
to cancer. ' '

These implants should be thoroughly re-tested until it is
determined that they do not pose serious health hazards.

Expensive appearance

Over the winter break I traveled
to Chicago for a convention of
the History Honor Society. I

learned quite a bit about Cyprus, .
Cossacks in Russian popular_

cultu re and witchcraft from papers
presented by students who were‘
probably as nervous as a teenager
catching a glimpse of forbidden
skin on Cinemax late at night. But
I learned more by walking around
Chicago itself and seeing how
people looked at what was
around them.

I strolled the streets dressed for
a convention. It wasn’t an
incredibly slick suit, but it was a
suit just the same. '

I click-clacked along Michigan i

Avenue in my nice shoes ——
which needed shining but were
still nice. My tie was calm, sedate,
businesslike. I even have short
hair —— the sort of person who
doesn’t cause trouble, a person
who, when treated right,’ might
spend a sizable amount of money
in these desperate retail times.
What other person would wear a
suit?

People treat you differently
when you’re dressed nicely.

. Salespeople say “please” and “sir”

and make the extra effort. If I
went into a certain “nice”
bookstore (with piped-in classical
music,) dressed in jeans, Chucks
and a 'l‘—shirt, it’s doubtful that the
clerk would have searched so
diligently for a novel I requested.
liven my trip into McDonalds on
Saturday morning was enhanced
by the ultra—quick service and the
extr.a-wide smile of the high-
school student behind the

’ counter.

Those on the street act
differently aswell. Theyare first

to step out of your way if that
crowded-sidewalk confrontation

arises; their eyes show respect,

and in turn you feel self—conf1dent
that nothing is wrong with your
world.

‘You walk tall and smile, and
even your smiles are taken
differently : some glance
nervously away, and others glare
back defiantly, daring’ you to
repeat your transgression. The
suit is power. Businesspeople
understand this. But what kind of
power is it?

A shallow power, I think, and
another example of our need to
continually,one—up each other.
Think of it this way: What if you‘

have a suit, but it’s not a very nice ‘i

one —— maybe a little old and
ratty, maybe too snug in the wrong
places? '

You're vulnerable. Someone"

‘with a tailor-fitted, Italian-named

suit can come along and exert a
kind of subliminal authority over

you —— a clothing authority. You ' '

won’t realize the force of this
authority until you’re asked your
opinion on something, and you
won’t venture forth what you
truly think because of. some
nagging fear in the back of your
mind that they’ll laugh at you, not
take you seriously because you’re
lower on the suit chain than they.
Until you’re tested by the system

= respect?

which created you, you'll never
realize the pervasiveness of its
influence.

I call this power shallow

because it doesn’t mean anything; I

it’s not based on anything honest.
Political -power is derived from
the electorate; a suit’s power
crassly comes from the size of
one’s wallet.

Power should be derived from A

your ability to think, to persuade,
to argue — not because you can
buy sharp suits. ' -
Maybe I’m overstating th
inﬂuence of the suit.
There are still places in the
world where ability counts for

something, places where less time. '
is spent complaining about things

like, oh, unfair trade practices,
and more time is spent making
the best damned whatever that
can be made. "

There must be. _

And a lot depends on the
environment as well. If I were to
wear my suit around campus, to
classes, to my job in the library, I
would get an awful lot of stares as
well as cause some people to
believe I’m a hardcore Republican
because liberals, evidently, loosen

-their ties and let their tongues

waggle. ,

I wonder what it means to be a
doctor, sporting blue cotton and
a stethoscope all the time, plus
those little booties they put over
whatever shoes they're wearing

Stepping into manhood

The encounter was brief. Lots of exertion and sweat to get to the point where
we were: I had hoped for a bit more. I had hoped for a long, drawn—out
relationship, but here in the Pittsburgh airport, for the first time —— this event was
quick. I didn’t expect romance, candlelight or a big meal or anything. I only hoped
for compassion. It was glamourized in the movies — cowboys, I think —— where
they swaggered into a saloon, saw their calling and went at it. 0

“Well, what do you expect for four bucks?” I told myself after it was over and

I Joshua Silverman

started for my plane. I looked down at thy‘-‘it-'tewly shined shoes and smiled. He
was good, I guess. It only cost four bucksanyway, and my shoes looked like new.

I had entered the shop looking to kill some time before my ﬂight was due, and
the brief moments that he had his hands_on my shoes — it was like a religious
experience. Not a word was said as I sat down in the chair while he pulled the
brushes, the polish and the “extra wax” (as I had asked for) out of the box.

I smiled. His blackened, rough hands, filthy from hours of shining, glistening
in the light, made their way from the tips of my toes to the heel of my shoe. As
he moved along my insole with the spotted rag that he used, I saw the sweat on
his arms, his brow: He was working hard. , _

He ﬁnished the ﬁrst coat of wax and paused. Just when I thought it was over,
he went at it again, applying a second coat of coal black Kiwi polish from the

metal container. Rapidly whisking away the polish with the blackened towel, he

quickly grabbed for a bottle of wax. Ah, wax. Therein lies the secret. It is the wax
that gives shoesrtheir shine, gives Doc Martens their “orthopedic” look. The wax
beaded off the shoes as he wiped it across the surface of the leather.

This was no place for a woman. All of the dark colors and abuse were not meant
for women’s shoes. It would not look right -— the dirty rags, the polish, the sweat
surrounding a woman’s patent leather heels —— too much glamour in a woman’s
shoe. This is a man’s place. This is a male experience. ,

“Please, no women allowed” the sign on the wallshould read. Not sexism or
chauvinism. A kind warning. This is a man’s place: smoky, sweaty, dirty — like
a boxing arena or poker game. All things being equal with the sexes, a woman
would look out of place here. I ' V

He was finished. Before Ieven realized what was happening, he had started
toward the register, dirty towel in hand. I glanced at my shoes, to him and back
to my shoes again. Slowly, like an exhausted runner, I made my way over to the
counter.

“Twofifty,” he said, as if they were one word. His voice was punctuated with
some unknown, undetectable accent. I handed him four. . ‘

“Keep the change,” I replied, staring at my shoes. He grunted his response.

The squeak of my shoes as I walked across the soft airport carpet was reassuring
to meias I entered the walkway and took my cramped seat on the plane home.
This, _the shine, the whole male experience was new to me, I went in a nervous

,.child, unaware of the experience ahead of me, and came out a man. I will never

4

be the same again.
As I stood awaiting my luggage, my mother, who had come with my father to

get me, said, “So what happened out at school?”
“I got my shoes shined,” I responded.
She looked confused. My father only smiled.

Breakup of Soviet Union  

 

might not lead to disaster

Ed K1 hhn
‘c ' e

If you think the world is becoming a
safer, more peaceful place with the
elimination of the Soviet Union and the
rise of a commonwealth of independent
states, think again. This is no time to forget
about that part of the world and focus
solely on ourselves. As Secretary of State
James Baker said, “History is giving no one
a breathing space.” This situation demands
attention; otherwise it could deteriorate
and become volatile. That would be in no
one’s interest.

The events in the Soviet Union -are
surrounded by strong irony. The organizers
of Au gust’s coup wanted a stronger Union
with more power in the center_. These men
did not want Gorbachev to give more
power to the individual republics. Their
coup failed, and Gorbachev returned to
Moscow wanting to restore normalcy. This
would become impossible because of Boris
Yeltsin.

Throughout the coup Yeltsin would
mount tanks to rally the people and excite
them with his democratic ideas. He wanted
to abandon the Communist system
Gorbachev wanted to preserve. With
Yeltsin, Gorbachev witnessed the erosion
of his power. Mikhail Gorbachev resigned
over Christmas because there was no
longer any central government over which
he could preside. ' I

Now the Soviet Union has become a

commonwealth of independent states led
by Yeltsin and the Russians. The people
line the streets crying, “Sodruzhestvo,” the
Russian word‘ for commonwealth. ,
Unfortunately, “sodruzhestvo” may just be
another Russian buzzword that will fail
like “perestroika” and “glasnost.” Yeltsin
may soon become a bankrupt leader like
Gorbachev. ‘ '

Boris Yeltsin has only gained credibiliw
in the past few months. Before this he was
an egotistic, bombastic boor who drank
too much. Now the fate of what.used to
be the Soviet Union lies primarily in his
hands. This will show the real Boris Yeltsin.

His future depends on the success or
failure of the commonwealth.
Commonwealth or Union, the people
still need to eat and live well. The coming
of winter has been an unwelcome prospect.
Ongoing shortages, enormous lines and
hyperinflated prices present problemsfor
any government. To compound the
problem, Yeltsin is moving ahead with his

desire for a market econorny”w’h‘i‘c‘h 

removes the state price controls and can

increase prices by as much as 1000 percent. _

As it is now, it takes a week's wages to buy
bread. There have already been occasional
riots for food. It will probably get worse.

These days, not even membersof the
military are living _well. Soldiers who must
leave the now-independent Baltic states

cannot find a place to live once they return ,

to their hometowns.

‘ Many soldiers and their families must , .

live in tents for the winter. There is growing
frustration in the military, as only 22

percent of all draftees are reporting for’

service. An unhappy army can cause great
concern for the government.

It could easily revolt to try and form
what it would consider a better system.
The most likely result would be violent
unrest. ' _

With the failing economy,'a skilled
professional must also look for a better
living. Cuts in‘the~military budget reduce
the number of employed nuclear scientists.
These people are finding high-paying jobs
in other countries which are presently

without nuclear technology. This could '

lead to extensive nuclear proliferation.
Of course the breakup of the Soviet
Union does not have to lead. to disaster. If
there can be enough foreign aid to feed
the people and restore production, the
commonwealth may succeed with its
ﬂedgling democracy and market economy.
The world must be willing to help, and the
Russian people must be patient. The fall of
communism will benefit the world, and
those benefits cannot come soon enough.

Consideration and politeness missing from boliday shopping

Ah  vacation. A time of
relaxation, holiday cheer and fun,
right? Not. 0 .

I, unlike most of you who took
advantage of this winter break by
either traveling or sleeping,
worked full time to acquire
enough money to pay off the bills
that had mounted during my first
semester. But I didn’t just work 
I worked retail. ‘

Yes, retail. That dwindling
industry that millions of people
all over the world are forced to
indulge since it is, of course, the

holiday season.

Since I hadn’t worked at Macy’s
for over a year (I worked there
during high school), I had
forgotten what it was like to be
on the other side of the register.
For 40—plus hours a week I was
one of those annoying
salespersons who rings the
register too slowly, who is forever
looking for SKU numbers to,put
in the register too slowly, the one
who doesn’t bend over backward
to give you the time and attention
you “deserve.”

But there are things that you, as
consumers, must understand.
Missing SKU numbers and price

Lisa Raff  

tags that are mismarked are not
the fault of the person behind the

- register. The fact that we have to

run to second—floor lingerie
departments to find a price tag on

a negligee you felt like purchasing,

on the first floor of the department
store is not our fault. SKU numbers
keep an accurate record of all the
merchandise that goes in and out
of the store. If that record isn’t
kept, then inventory is impossible
to calculate, the store has no idea
how much money they've lost for
the day, and the store goes
bankrupt. And if the store goes
bankrupt, then shoppers have no
where to shop. So it’s a vicious
circle and one ‘that requires
patience. . _

A few tips for better service in
department stores: 0

-Being rude to salespeople is
no way to get them to move any
faster.

-Keep your obscenities to
yourself. A quick example: There

was a woman shopping in my’

department on Christmas Evewho
had an uncontrollable urge to
swear about everything: the size
of the clothes, the price of the
clothes, the fact that we didn’t
have boxes at our register. Now
each of these things is beyond
my control. However there were
children in our departmentwhose
ears weren’t quite mature enough
to hear her language. True, her
vocabulary is used on a daily
basisyby others, but if children
feel the need to be exposed to it,
they can go home and turn on
cable TV.

oDon’t go in with the attitude
that the cashier is incompetent.
We are a perceptive bunch, and
if we feel that someone thinks we
don’t know what we’re doing,
well, we can do one of two
things. We can try to prove to you
that we do have active brain
cells, thereby getting you out of
the store faster (in which case
you’d bepretty lucky), or we can
live up to your expectations,
pretend we know nothing’ about
the store or the merchandise and
practically force you to run out of
the store in an aggravated frenzy.

_(This is usually the most viable

option and one that is well
practiced.)

-A little note to American
Express Gold and Platinum Card
members: Your plastic does not
impress us. We deal with large
amounts of cash on a dailybasis,
and a colored credit card does
nothing to boost our energy,
especially if we’re not on
commission.

-When returning merchandise,
understand that it is not the

’c cashier’s policy that merchandise

must be returned with at least a
price tag or receipt. Several
customers treated me as though I
had a personal vendetta against
them for not accepting
merchandise that did not have
either a tag or receipt.

-If a salesperson answers a
question for you, but it doesn’t
suit your needs, don’t ask to see
a manager. Hard as it is to believe,
we do know the policies. A
manager will only reiterate and
cause you double the aggravation
because now that's two people
who’ve told you something you
don’t want to hear. ‘

-Don’t ask salespeople if and
when merchandise is going on

sale. We don’t know anything

_ more than you do when it comes

to markdowns. In fact, I didn’t
even know there was a coupon
sale at Macy’s’ until a customer
brought one to me that had been
in the newspaper three days
before. Also,‘ ifyou do happen to

ask and a salesperson says, “I A
don’t know,” he or.she means, ‘‘I _

don’t know.” You should not
accost another employee
regarding the same topic. This
system only aggravates workers
and labels you a bitch, which
then means that salespeople will
do everything in their power to
annoy you, which brings us back
to the patience thing — because
you will wind up spending more
time in the store than you had
originally planned. ,

. Which brings me to the
beginning, which brings me to
the end: People on both sides of
the counter should just have a
little consideration, especially
around the holidays when

everyone should be nice to’

everyone else...

Women ’5 hoops loses
fzft/9 stmig/92,‘ contest

By Ryan Buncher
suqr Writer

Sunday's 56-51 loss at Syracuse extended the Pitt women’s
basketball team’s losing streak to five games and dropped its
overall record to 4-7 (0-2 in the Big East).

“Playing anybody on their court is going to be tough,” Lady
Panther head coach Kirk Bruce said. “What is disappointing is
that it was a game we could have won, a game we should have
won. We led the whole second half until there was about a
minute left. We had an eight-point lead once.”

Both teams struggled fromthe field. The Orangewomen (5-
6, 1-1) shot only 35 percent, and Pitt hit at a .396 clip. The Lady
Panthers were outrebounded 39-34, but hitting only nine of 18
from the free-throw line may have been more damaging.

Sophomore forward Jill Colabrese scored a game-high 16
points on five-for-12 shooting, including two for two from
three—point range. Pitt’s top two scorers, sophomore forward
Jonna Huemrich and senior center T uria Ransom, combined for
only six‘ points and three-for—12 shooting from the field.
Huemrich did have eight rebounds and six steals. Senior center
Shawn Ziemba scored 14 points and grabbed 11 rebounds for
the Orangewomen.

Pitt’s game Friday at Providence (8-2) was similar to last
season's meetings with the Friars — a high-scoring loss. This
time the final was 109-90. ‘

“They do that to you,” Bruce said. “They raise the tempo of
the game. They give you a lot of shots, and if you make them
you can stay in the game.”

Huemrich scored a career-high 36 points and had nine
rebounds. Her previous career high in scoring was 23 earlier
this season against George Mason.

Sophomore guard Erin Maloy scored 13 while shooting three
for 12_from the field, all 12 shots being three point attempts.

Ransom had 10 points on perfect shooting: three for three from

Even Duquesne coach John Carroll could not defend Sean Miller and the Panthers Monday night.

Leading into Monday night’s
Pitt-Duquesne clash at the Civic
Arena, we all heard about the
good old days when this was
“the” game on both schools’
schedule and how the Dukes and
Panthers battled in memorable
contests that were won by
Duquesne as often as Pitt. The
Panthers’ slim 30-29 series
advantage told us that, yes, this
was once a great rivalry. But no
longer.

Before the 1976-’77 season, the
Eastern Collegiate

Duquesne-Pitt rivalry lessens as teams drift apart

with two wins over Rutgers as
well as victories against Temple,
Penn State and West Virginia for
a respectable 10-8 finish in
conference play.

But then there is the Pitt rivalry.
Although the talent gap between
the two teams has appeared to
close recently, the results haven’t
been closer at all.

Duquesne broke through with
an 80-76 decision at Palumbo
Center in 1988, but Pitt has won
19 of 26 games since both schools

Basketball League
(later the Eastern 8)
formed, bringing Pitt
and Duquesne

Rob

joined conferences,
with the Panthers
holding the average
margin of victory to

together twice a year.
The league lasted until 1982. The
last season Duquesne beat Pitt at
Fitzgerald‘ Field House, 72-62.
Those days seem ancient —

I ancient as in biblical times. Gone

forever. _

Not to rehash the story again,
but, as we know, Pitt bolted for
the Big East and has pretty much
owned this rivalry for the last
decade. With Monday’s 93-69
shellacking, the Panthers earned
their 10th win in the last 11
meetings and third straight over
the Dukes.

Pitt’s program has received
valuable national exposure from

- the Big East, while Duquesne

has ﬂoundered for the most part
-in the Atlantic 10.

T he,Dukes have seen a light of
hope with the recent recruiting
success of Coach John Carroll
and last season forged.~ ahead

Pugliese

six wins.

Carroll has made it a point this
season to stress that he has a very
young team with a very promising
future. ’

After a blowout loss to Temple
in early December and again on

.Monday night, Carroll reiterated
this point. .

“I think our best players are our
younger players,” Carroll said.
“That’s no knock against our older
guys, but when you have an
[Derrick] Alston, a [Efrem]
\X/hitehead or a [Ganon] Baker,
our older guys are our
complementary players.”

In Alston, a 6—foot, 10-inch

sophomore center, Whitehead, a .

6-5 sophomore guard, and Baker,
a 6-1 ﬁrst—year floor general, the
Dukes have a solid foundation
upon which to build.

Volleyball finishes season A
with NCAA Tournament loss-

By Ryan Buncher
suqr Writer

Last season the Pitt volleyball
team (28-9) got its first victory in
NCAA tournament play at the
expense of Ohio State. This
season the Panthers were not so

' lucky. The 12th—ranked, Big Ten

champion Buckeyes (27-3
entering the tournament) ended
the Panthers’ season by defeating
them three games to one.

‘‘I thought we played well
against Ohio State,” Pitt head
coach Sue Woodstra said. “Ohio
State was much better than they
were last year. They are very
solid and have much better
balance in their attack.”

In addition to the tough
opponent, the Panthers had the
disadvantage of Big East Player
of the Year Ann Marie Lucanie
being at less than 100 percent
because she aggravated an ankle
injury in. the New Mexico
tournament the previous week.

Ohio State went on to beat
16th—ranked Penn State and
seventh-ranked Nebraska to reach
the final four, where it lost to
ninth-ranked UCLA.

Pitt did continue its dominance
of the Big East by winning all
seven conference matches, losing

only one game, on the \way to the
regu1ar—season crown. They
dominated the conference
tournament, beating Boston
College 15-1, 15-0, 15-6 in the first
round, Providence 15-7, 15-3, 15-
5 in the semifinals and Syracuse
15-10, 15-11, 15-8 in the
championship game. Lucanie
garnered Most Outstanding Player

1 of the Tournament for the second

straight year.

“We went through many phases
this season with injuries and
illness,” Woodstra said, looking
back on the season. “I’m proud of
the way the team stayed together
and played well when it might
not have been so easy for them to
play well.”

One goal that was not fulﬁlled
was moving up to the next level.
Pitt did not win a match against
Top 20 competition. In addition
to Ohio State, there were two
heartbreaking losses to Penn State
and a late—season loss to eighth-
ranked New Mexico. The Panthers
still might have ended up in the
Top 20 if not for an early season
slump in which they lost four of
five while senior co-captain Sue
Zonneville was out w.ith mono.

Zonneville was among six
seniors who finished their
volleyball careers at Pitt this

season. Of the others, co-captain -

and middle hitter Dee MacAu1ay,
outside hitter Heather Hollands,
and outside hitter Linda Zols were
starters this season. Shelly Seanor
and Bridget Gary were the first
two players off the bench when
Gary was healthy. The 5-foot, 6-
inch outside hitter suffered
through knee and shoulder
problems in addition to missing a
match due to food poisoning.

“They are a very special class,”
Woodstra said. “Each brought
something to the team. They all
brought cohesiveness to the team.
I have been involved with many
teams, and I know how good it is
to have teammates you enjoy
playing with.” ,

Despite the losses, Woodstra
expects the team to at least
maintain the level of the last two
years.

“(First-year setter] Annie
[Mernagh] has a solid year of
experience and she will be better.
Ann Marie [Lucanie] will be better.
She might have surgery on her
ankle which bothered her all year.”
Woodstra said the Panthers are
using the wide-open situation of
four spots in the starting lineup in
their recruiting. They have verbal
commitments from two players

As col1ege—basl<etball season
gets into full swing, there are
many items of interest which I’ve
been carrying around with me
over the holiday. To begin with:

-Does Syracuse now run the
NCAA? I’ve been pondering this
possibility ever since an NCAA
committee announced that
OrangemanjuniorConradMcRae
was eligible to play at Syracuse.
Apparently the committee made
a mistake in weighing the

-evidence against Syracuse in

McRae’s recruitment. Just days
‘before, however, the NCAA was
singing a slightly different tune:
that the Orangemen had illegal
advantages in signing the 6-foot,’
10-inch McRae. This means that
somebody acted as street “agent" '
on behalf of the ‘Cuse. This
practice is fairly popular, but this
time the NCAA must have thought .
they really had something.
Evidently not, as McRae had his

X eligibility restored quickly and

meekly.

A nice show of forceby the
NCAA, proving once again that
these clowns are unable (or at
least unwilling) to be impartial in
their judgments. Harken back to
1989, when Kansas was barred

Continued from page 12
but can’t say anything about them
yet. I

“This is also an opportunity for

_ the new players this year after

getting a chance to watch the
seniors play,” Woodstra said.
That includes S-9 middle hitter
Carrie Thornton, who returned
from a redshirt year due to a knee-
injury, 5-9 outside hitter Chelsea

Miller, Hovan pace gmpplers tofozst stem

~ By Bob Maselli
4Sta_[f Writer

Well, it's time for another season of Pitt
wrestling, and with that announcement,
the Panthers have just returned from a
tournament-ﬁlled holiday season with some
impressive results.

In the first tournament, the Pitt grapplers
traveled to Chicago Dec. 28-29 to compete
in the Midlands Tournament against some
of the best individual wrestlers in the
cou ntry from over 40 schools, including the
defending national champion Iowa
Hawkeyes and the perennial powerhouse
Arizona State Sun Devils.

In this event, three of head coach Rande

Stottlemyer’s men placed in the top 10, ‘

while two wrestlers came within one match
of doing the same. Scott Hovan, wrestling
at 158 pounds, finished seventh. Shawn
Gibbs at 167 also took home a seventh-

place finish. The best finish came from
heavyweight Perry Miller. Miller came away
with a ﬁfth-place ﬁnish. Steve Budman (142)
and Joe Bursick (134) wrestled well,
according to Stottlemyer, but didn’t make it
to the ﬁnals.

In a second tournament, the Panthers
visited Wilkes Barre, Pa., this past weekend
to wrestle in the Wilkes Open Tournament.
When it was all over, four champions were
crowned from the Pitt team. Budman, Hovan
(167),JeffKloiber (190) and Miller all ﬁnished
in first place in the open event. '

First—year grappler John Richey, wrestling
at 126 pounds, ﬁnished in third place, while
redshirt freshman Pat Wiltanger grabbed a
second-place ﬁnish in the heavyweight
division. Stottlemyer is expecting big things
from both men in the future.

Miller and Wiltanger had to wrestle each
other in the final match.

“We wanted both guys to win, but you

THE PI'IT NEWS, Wednesday, January 8, 1992

can’t have that, so you just let them both
wrestle and coach neither one,” Stottlemyer
said.

“The guys did well in both tournaments,
and I was very pleased, especially with the
older guys and the way they carried the
load,” Stottlemyer said. “The competition
at both tournaments, especially the
Midlands Tournament, .was strong. We
really weren’t sure how we would do, so
I was happy with the end results.”

PITT BITS: Last year the Panthers
finished with a disappointing 4-12 record,
but there were some excellent individual
performances put in by members of the
squad. Hovan, starting his third season,
finished with a record of 31-5-0 and earned
Eastern Wrestling league and All-American
honors. He finished in sixth place in the
NCAA tournament among a field of 90
wrestlers. Heavyweight Perry Miller ended

Senior guard/forward Tracy Lis,
a ﬁrst-team all-Big East selection
last season, led the way for
Providence with 56 points and 14
rebounds. Sophomore forward
Jennifer Mead chipped in 25
points and seven rebounds.

The Panthers were in the Seei-
Bach Cardinal Classic in Louisville
Dec. 28-29, losing 91-63 to Texas
Tech on the ﬁrst day and 65-63 to
Hartford in the consolation game.

“Texas Tech was very good;
they won the whole thing. They

even beat Louisville,” Bruce said. ’

“Hartford beat us on a buzzer
beater.”
West Virginia started the losing

I streak, beating Pitt 91-63 on Dec.

21 behind a career-high, 33-point
effort by Rosemary Kosiorek.,This

‘followed a 74-72 victory at’

Michigan on Dec. 17, which was
keyed by Huemrich (20 points,
11 rebounds) and Ransom (16
points, eight rebounds). With
Colabrese not playing, 6—foot, 5-
inch sophomore center Carolyn
Miller stepped into the starting
lineup and contributed 10 points
and six rebounds before fouling
out.

Bruce pointed out the offensive
end’ as the main problem.

“We are just having problems
putting the ball in the basket,
especially the last two games -—
even scoring 90 against
Providence because they give up
that many,” Bruce said. “We

should have scored more against I

them. '

“One real positive haslbeen,‘

our guard play —'— speciﬁcally
Carol Morton, Erin Maloy and Jill
Colabrese,” Bruce said. “Those
three have played very well.” .

Bruce putMorton in the starting V

point guard position in the last
two games, moving Maloy to

shooting guard and senior Jill,

McElhinny to a reserve role.

“I wanted to see how that would
look,” Bruce said. “She gives us a
little more quickness, better
defense on the press, and it leaves
Maloy free to score a little more
instead of playing the point.”

Morton is averaging only 2.9
points per game but is second on
the team in assists with 37 and
leading in steals with 27 while
playing only 20 minutes per game.
Another first-year forward, Julie
Fornadel, has been a solid
contributor off the bench.

Huemrich leads the team in
scoring, with 16.7 points per
game, and rebounds, with 8.4 per
game. Ransom, coming off a

season in which she missed all.

but eight games due to academic
problems, is averaging 11 points
and 5.7 rebounds. Colabrese, who
did-not play much last season,
has become a solid offensive
player.

Pitt returns home for the first
time since Dec. 1 to play Villanova
tonight.

Junior Nikki Benedix, a6-foot
forward, leads the Wildcats in
scoring, averaging 16.4 points
per game through’ last week.

“It’s good that we're home when
we really need a win,” Bruce
said. “Villanova is always tough
because they have good
shooters.”

‘Fieldhouse Fanatics’ brek up

. . Paul Diamond/The Pitt News
This group of Fitzgerald crazies are bringing tl1e word 'spirit' back to Panther basketball.

Well, finally this writer sees
some school spirit. After all my
columns about how there is no
excitement when it comes to
sports on this campus, I‘ can
resoundingly say I’m pleased.
There is a ray of hope for people
such as myself,- who want to
show our true colors and support
the sports teams at this university,
where student apathy is a way of
life.

Bob Maselli

athetic mold at P2’

Case in point: Since the men’s

basketball season started, a small -

but growing group of fans have
gathered behind the Panther
basket and cheered, with many

, different techniques, chants and

unorthodox sayings. You’ve seen
them on TV. Local newspapers
‘have written about them, and
local sports talk shows have
mentioned them.

These fans are known as the
“Fieldhouse Fanatics.” They are
trying to do what, in recent
memory, no other group (sorry,

cheerleaders) has done before:

Get the fieldhouse, the fans and
especially the team fired up while ‘

insulting and discouraging the

visiting team. Occasionally, afew »
' choice words are directed at the

officials, but it’s all in good fun.
So far they are getting the job
done for the Panthers.

This is exactly what this school .

needs, but the sad fact is only the

“Fieldhouse Fanatics” stand and '

cheer throughout the whole

game. They need more people to:

get involved. join them. It’s fun.
Be a part of a group that doesn’t

care who you are as long as you I

get into the act. .

It’s a real shame to see people
at the games who just sit with
their hands on their laps and
don’t want to cheer or show
some enthusiasm. They go to
games, sit and talk about

everything else but the game. ‘

Then when it’s over, they don’t

Rivalry

Continued from page 12

, and mammoth Alan Watkins, and

the Dukes should be a pretty
good club next season — even
later this year. But the youngsters

showed Monday night that they

are not ready for a team of Pitt’s
caliber.

And it’s not like the Panthers
are seasoned veterans, either.
Duquesne is improving, but this
rivalry is over for the time being.
Don’t forget. Pitt is loaded with
young talent as well, players who
are still learning the game.

They are a team with a
promising » future — not what
most critics expected.

The latest Panther rout began
innocently enough. The young
Panthers came out strong, taking
a 20-15 lead before Chris McNeal
and Ahmad Shareef ignited a 13-
point run that left the Dukes
reeling for the knockout punch
at 33-15 with seven minutes
remaining in the first half.

But the Dukes responded with
- a run of their own, rolling off 10

straight and 18 of the next 21
points to cut the Panthers’ margin

to only 36—33.

Senior guard James Hargrove
knifed inside the paint for two
hanging buckets that brought the
Dukes’ fans alive. A fired-up Eric
Mobley delivered a counterpunch
for Pitt with two thunderous slam
dunks, the first over Alston and
the second a monster follow of a
Darren Morningstar miss that bent
the breakaway rim out of place
and brought Pitt’s faithful to their
feet.

Hargrove came back for
Duquesne, slashing right at
Mobley for two more off the
goaltending call, and Pitt led 40-
35 at the half.

The second half was ugly to
put it mildly.

After a one-handed jam from
Watkins brought the Dukes to
within 43-37, Pitt finally threw
the roundhouse right and fatal
uppercut that put Carroll and his
young Dukes on their back for
good.

A free throw by McNeal made
it 44-37. Sean Miller hit a long

jumper from the left corner for a.

46-37 lead. McNeal continued his

workman effort with one of his
15 rebounds and another put
back off Jermaine Morgan's
missed free throw. Pitt went up
by 1 1. Morgan then slashed inside
for two straight buckets and a
free throw, giving Pitt a 53-37
cushion. A smooth turnaround
by McNeal made it 55-37, and Pitt
cruised from there, building the
lead to its height at 83-53, while
head coach Paul Evans cleared
his entire bench. V

“We wanted to come out and
put them away in the second half
instead of letting them back in it,”
said McNeal, Pitt’s leading scorer
with 16. He credited Pitt’s
tenacious defense for blowing
the game open and said that Pitt’s
lack of concentration and lapse
of intensity let Duquesne make
the late, first—half run.

Early in the second half Pitt’s
full—court press, featuring a lineup
of Miller, Morningstar, Jerry
McCullough, Orlando Antigua
and Chris Gant threw Duquesne
completely out of sync. The
Dukes couldn’t run with Pitt and
looked even worse in the

halfcourt set.

Their big gun, Hargrove, was
held to a season-low 10 points on
5-for—13 shooting, largely because
of McCullou gh’s pressure defense.
McCullough scored just three
points but contributed seven
assists, three rebounds and two
steals in 22 minutes.

“I was concentrating on
stopping James and running the
team,” McCullough said. ‘‘I get a
lot out of running the team and
making a good assist.”

Baker was a non—factor against
Miller and McCullough, while
Alston and 6-10 Willie Ladson
spent most of the game 30 feet
from the basket, lost and
confused. Alston needs to be a
dominant force inside if
Duquesne can be a solid club,
but he seemed intimidated by
Pitt’s size and committed five
turnovers while grabbing only
five rebounds in 36 minutes. ,

“Reality is that Darren and Chris
and those other guys play against
big, strong people every game,”
Carroll said. “Derrick doesn’t see
big, strong post people every day
in practice, and he doesn’t see
big, strong post people when we
play. He really isn’t used to dealing
with guys like that.

“Obviously, if you were there
tonight  you saw one team just
kick the butt out of the other
team. We just got our heads
handed to us tonight,” Carroll
said. 3

Carroll called the loss
“embarrassing” to his program
and said it was a discouraging
experience that hurt the pride of
‘his young club. Carroll reflected
deep disappointment in letting
down after a heavy media buildup

to this game as one which would
earn back lost respect for
Duquesne’s program. Even before
the game, much was made of that
word: respect. The atmosphere
was there for the Dukes to make
a statement, but Du quesne won’t
get any respect from this effort
and nobody felt worse than
Carroll.

“We weren’t able to give a
good effort, and it’s very
disappointing to our fans and to
our kids to play so poorly in front
of so many people,” he said. “If
there was something I could have
done to get out of that game
earlier, I would have done it,
‘cause it was like Chinese torture
for the last 10 to 12 minutes. No
one is to blame but the head
coach.

“We got a little dose of reality
tonight. Reality is they’re a big,
strong team, a well-coached team
and a very good team,” Carroll
said. .
He failed to add to his praise
that Pitt is also a very young
team, but maybe Carroll didn’t
think about it.

He probably did, but maybe he

really didn’twant to scare himself. _ ,

Reality is also ‘that Pitt taught the
young Dukes a hard lesson while
stamping a statement on the
future. Duquesne is young and
will get better, but it’ll need to do
much more than that to compete
with Pitt. Carroll and Duquesne
had enough of reality for a while.

Fans

Continued from page 15
“Fieldhouse Fanatics.” It’s funny
to see the passive fans (and they
know who they are) sitaround
and act too tough or Cool to get
involved. Well, folks, I got news
for ya. People like you will never
make it anywhere. You will be
the Norm Petersons of the world.
You don’t get involved now; you

.- never will.

The ultimate goal of the
“Fieldhouse Fanatics” is to get
the whole ﬁeldhouse involved in
the basketball games. It’s not
such an unattainable goal, but it
could be a hard one in light of
how fans generally act at the
games. iWhat’s really ironic is if
you look around during the games
and you look to the reserved
seating where the older fans sit,
you’ll see them get more excited
during the games than the
students. It doesn’t make sense.
These people are more excited to
come to a game than many of the
students.

I know that many of you who .

are reading this will say that the

“Fanatics” are just a group of.

guys that have nothing better to
do or they are just putting on a
show or they are “stupid” or silly,
but that's just the attitude that we

. don’t want to have at this school.

During the Christmas break, about
20 of us “Fanatics” piled into five
cars and took a road trip to cheer

on the Panthers at West Virginia. '

We met up with some other fans
who traveled to the game and
had a great section of fans to
support the team. These fans are
in for the duration.

If you think that the “Fanatics”
are stupid and cheering doesn’t
help, then you're not the type of
person that_ﬁts the bill. On that
note, don’t go to the Aganies. Give
your ticket to people who want

to show their support. Tickets are A
_ scarce, and students are always

looking for them. This young
team needs the so— called “sixth
man.” We can make a difference.

the players. The faces are
somewhat different this year, but
the wins keep coming.

-Other players and teams
which have piqued my interest:
The Tulane Green Wave. If you
remember back to when Tulane

got the “death penalty” from the
almighty NCAA, then you might
be surprised to see how far this
program has come in a few short
years. Coach Perry Clark, a former
Georgia Tech assistant, has the
Wave headed for glory. Anthony

Reed is the star player. At 6-9, he
needs only a consistent face—the—
basket game to be a future pro.

to have forgotten last year’s
lethargy. Coach Steve Fisher
needs to go out this year and get
a good point guard, as Michael
Talley will be leaving soon.
