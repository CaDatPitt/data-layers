HIGH PRICE CHARGES DENIED  
   MANAGER OF BOOKSTORE

A «“Pi_tt’s bookstore prices’ can not be
compared with those at other uni-
versities, unless all factors, such as

service,_quality and ownership are.

considered,” says Harry Meese,
manager of the University book-
store, in reply to students “register-
mg, complaints‘, because of lower
prices at Carnegie Tech.
'; Arguments ensued when an inves-
tigation of Carnegie Techbookstoife
prices, proved that their textbooks
are‘ sold ‘at ten per‘ cent discount,
while those here are discounted, at
only five per cent. Theme paper at
Carnegie is twenty ‘cents per pound,
butthe Pitt bookstore.‘ price is" ﬁf-
teen. cents for ﬁfty sheets, weighing
slightly less than one-half. pound’.
Flexible leather notebooks, eight and
one-half’ by eleven inches in size,
costing "$1.50 at the Tartan. store,
are sold-" at $1.60 at Pitt, while the
same" size stiff-back, covers which
can be .purchased at twenty-ﬁve
centsat Carnegie sell for one dollar
here. _' v ‘ '
~Lefax -notebooks, which are $1.40

  
 

at -Pitt, , are _s_old- for
jllfiiblll?-P‘?"‘  S

In spite of the price differences at
the two schools, Mr. Meese claims
_that_the- service at‘ Pitt is better.
“While Tech students must. wait
weeks for books not in, Pitt students
receive any American book within

book within a month after it has

i been ordered,” he says.

“Besides,” says Meese, “losses at
the bookstore. at Tech are taken
care of by the Carnegie fund, while
the bookstore at Pitt ‘is owned and
operated ‘by the University. _If Pitt,
as Harvard, had at co-operative
store privately run, prices could be
lowered very much.
every student upon. entering "the
-school, pays a certain ﬁve dollar" fee
which enables him to buy all ma-
terials at cost‘ at the bookstore.”

Quality of the goods must also be
taken into account, says Meese, in-
sisting that Carnegie paper, al-
though sold at half the.price charged
at_ Pitt, has ‘neither the quality not
ﬁnish of~Pitt’s. A I

Will Take Leading Role of
‘The Servant In the House.’

FIRST. GIVEN IN‘ 1908

One of Series By Which
Author. Works Out World '

Problems Of Ethics.

“The Servant in the House,”

Charles . Rann Kennedy’s ﬁve-act

modern morality play, given by Pitt

Players, will _ occupy the Heinz

house stage Friday night. The grad-

uate manager’s office, 104 State

Hall, is distributing tickets. M. Mil-.
ton _Brauman, Col. ’28, will play the

leading role. ‘

' When ﬁrst presented in 1908, the

play established the reputation of

its author as a dramatist. It is one

of the few “dramas of ‘suggestion,’-’

popular in the ﬁrst decade of the

present century, that is still alive’
on the ‘stage.

The story, brieﬂy, is that of three

brothers; one a successful East In-

dianibishop, one a, rising youg vicar

in an English church, and the third

 

 

radrunkard and an outcast, by oc-

cupation a cleaner of drains. There
is also the vicar’s_ wife, known as
“Auntie,” and the drunkard’s daugh-
ter “Mary,” whom f‘Auntie” has
adopted, keeping her in ignorance
of her’ father.

ﬂuence exerted by “Manson,” the"In-
dian butler, whose presence subtly
affects everybody, and the ﬁnal de-
nouncement shows him to be the
bishop of Benares and brother of
the vicar and drainman. His‘ inﬂu-
ence, his self-restraint, his . exalte-
tion of his subordinate position, all
suggest beyondga doubt the charac-
ter of Jesus Christ.-

“The Servant in the House” is
the ﬁrst of a series. of seven plays
for seven-players inwhich Dr. Ken-
nedy attempts. to work out world
problems of ethics. Mr. Kennedy’s
purpose as a playwright, he admits,
is to make the Bible a living thing.
He interprets the Bible in terms of
modern thought, and modern thought
in terms of the Bible. .

-1 Kennedy was born in England,
but most of his dramatic work has
been done in America. Here he
has produced and acted in hislown.
plays, and for years he and his wife,
a-.distinguished actress,‘ have had
chargeof the dramatic work at the
Bennett School,’ New York.

school of education.

Among the topics tobe taken up
in the conference will be the chem-
ist, coach, teacher, school adminis-
trator", engineer in_ business, tech-
nical‘ engineer, journalist, writer,

man, industrial manager, person-
nel director, and ﬁnancier. A more

Philadelphia in 1905.

This Takes You Back 20 Years
This is a little reminiscent story of 20 years ago... 'In‘¢i_-*
dentally, it isbrought to mind, by a casual meeting with J."Ed'gar
Knott, Eng. ’08, on the street car one morning last week. Knott,
who IS assistant manager of the Connecticut General Life In-
surance Co., Thirteenth Floor, Park Building. is a little, short
‘fellow, who used to run a mighty fast half mile for old W. U. ’
P. ‘over in Allegheny; (now the North Side). He was speedy _
enough to make the one mile relay team which took a’tri_p1to«

car We remarked to himthat he al-
ways recalled. a picture appearing
in the “Pittsburgh Gazette Times’? in
1905 of ‘that relay team. It was
taken at Brunot Island track in low-
or North Side where the tryouts
were held. . In tltosedays there were
no good quarter ‘mile tracks handy
for the relay team to work, out on,
and they had to go away down to
Brunots , Island and run ‘off their
trials to decide the four best men.
. The picture in question ‘showed
‘;‘Eddie” Knott, -R.’ ‘H. (“Herve”)

Gill. Eng. 706. and James I. (.“Jim”)
McCormick-, Col. ’06. The thing that
seemed to impress this -picture on
the mind of the editor was the size
of “Billy”. Kn t compared to the
other“ tlIre_e fe ows. Gill and Mc-
Cormick were giants who weighed
around 185, and Jamison was of

-the other..,two boys. “Billy” Knott,
however. was a ‘sawed-oif chap of
about ﬁve feet-ﬁve and_he looked
like a pigmy in the picture with the

to contain a photographic plate of
that quartet, and every time we see
.“Bi_1ly” we print 3. picture from it.

and we used to-marvel at the ‘way
he stood the pace in‘ the half mile,
o ,posed»to fast competition. Hewas
“a- so o‘nei-of the"‘big guns” in man-
aging “The Owl” during his junior
year. He was always snappy eyed
and peppy and was a supreme opti-
mist. The same attributesare help-
ing him to makeagood in the busi-
ness world. .He. is one ofithe‘ most

_. Speaking of “Harve” Jamison re-
calls to mind also our meeting with
him in San-Francisco’ at the time of
the Pitt-Stanford ‘football game. In
1922. The Pitt alumni were having
"a banquet atpa San ~Francisc_o. Hotel,

‘.‘The Pennsylvania Slush Fund” is

 

“Laws on Radio
Control” and over a hundredother
scandals of national or local interest,
-thefacts of which have furnished the
seniors» in the ‘school of business ad-

tion theses in June. _
Since the institution of the thesis
requirements for graduation -from
the school of business administration
three years ago, the topics selected
have covered many ﬁelds,.especiallyi
since each student reserves his-topic
at the beginning of the second semes-

ing prevents the selection of the
'same_ subject by any other student’.
A~co'mplete study of every phase of
the topic is made, and the iihesis, if
accepted, carries with it two credits
toward graduation. _According to,
‘Word from Mr.
theses so far.have_.-beenﬂfrom ﬁve, to
over forty pages long.

Among the topics chosen by the
present class are “.l°ournalism in Ar-
gentine,” by Harry W. Sack; “For-
eign Exports of Autos from the U.
.‘.” by G. E. Smith; “College En-
rollments in ‘Periods of Prosperity»

Dr. J ., Gillman Computes
Iron, Steel Barometer

_ A barometer showing that produc-
tion of iron and steel in the3_Pitts-

tionaltrend of the industry has been
computed by Dr. Joseph Gillman,
‘director of the bureau of business
research"of- the school of business
adminis7tratio.n. The purpose of the
b_arometer is "to make this informa-
tion about Pittsburgh’s basic indus-
try accessible to men engaged in
other industries. for purposes of
comparison, said Dean Louis. K.
Manley. _

Dr. Gillman’s study indicates
which represents from 50 to 65 per
cent of the industrial activities of
Allegheny county in the Pittsburgh

tablished national barometer.‘ in- its
ciclycal movements. ' ' ' .
In compiling material for the ba

rometer of the =-iron_ and steel" in-
dustry, the tonnage production of
p1g"1I‘O,1'11WaS used as a measure of
activity. . This , was done‘ .because
monthly data as to’ steel produc-
tion in the district are not avail-
able.. . i ;-

The barometer points‘ out that
percentages of furnaces commonly

in production of pig, iron, have‘-
-been found unreliable because of
the growing increase in furnace ef-
ficiency and of a growing substi-
-tution‘ of furnaces ‘of larger capaci-
ty for those -of smaller. * " A

Pickard, who goes 13 feet out-

Canadian A. A. U. record at 1.2
feet, 8 inches, went over the bar
with». half-foot to spare, thus in-
dicating that he may again raise

Teacher Prefers American
Colleges to Those *Abroad

 

A European who prefers‘Amer-
ican colleges to "those abroad is
found in Dimitry. E. Olshevsky,
graduate assistantin the physics de-
partment, who came here from
Czecho-Slovakia a month ago;

' The number of automobiles among
both instructors and students, the
lack of interest in aviation in our
universities, and the advancement
of our dances, are the things that
have impressed him -most about

" —America,’ he disclosed in an inter-

view last week. V

“The Charleston is just beginning
to get started in Czecho-Slovakia,
Germany and France,” he said. “It
is already going out of mode in this

. country.” .

. He prefers American schools over’
those of Europe becauseof our su-
perior laboratories and laboratory
methods.

Prof. Believes Russia One
Of Six Future Countries

 

_ That Russia will be one of the six
great coun‘ries of the future is the
belief of Paul F. Shupp, assistant
professor of history. _
‘Explaining “Bolshevism” Prof.
Shu_pp_ stated: “‘Bclshevik’ means
majority and Menshevik, means
minority. These two factions were
formed in _1902 when the social dem-
ocrats split into two -parties. The
Bolsheviks believe/V that a revolution
was Russ'ia.’s~sValvation and wanted
