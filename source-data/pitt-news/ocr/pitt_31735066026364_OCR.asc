Unlimited PAT rides: is the
convenience worth the cost?

Jason Gallinger
Staff Wrlter

Pitt’s parking and transportation
department has unveiled a proposal
that would allow students to ride
PAT buses anywhere in Allegheny
County for free.

“It is a plan that opens the city
and the entire region to our stu-
dents,” said director of parking and
transportation Robert Harkins.

Under the new plan, students
could ride any Port Authority
Transportation buses across any
number of zones and never have to
worry about the need for transfer
fare. All they’d have to do is ﬂash
their Pitt IDs to the driver.

Current University shuttle routes
would remain intact and free of
charge to help students get around
campus. Even routes like the North
Oakland bus that travels through
areas heavily served by PAT would
remain unchanged.

Inﬂuenced by students’ requests
for such a program, Harkins said he
has been working on the proposal
since he came to Pitt five years ago.
Recently, students’ requests for an
expansion of the U-zone, in which
students can ride for free between
Squirrel Hill, Shadyside and Craft
Avenue, prompted him to push hard-
er to make the idea a reality, he said.

The proposal would, however,
come at a considerable financial cost

to Pitt. The University’s administra-
tion says it would have no choice but
to raise students’ security and trans-
portation fees to cover the cost.

Parking and transportation is
considering two options for the
amount of the increase.

One plan calls for full—time stu-
dents to pay an extra $30 per semes-
ter, increasing their security and
transportation fee to $67 a semester.
Part-time students would pay an
extra $15 per semester, raising their
fee to $31.

The alternative option calls for
an across—the—board fee for all stu-
dents. Regardless of their enrollment
status, students would pay‘ a $55-
per—semester security and trans-
portation fee.

Parking and transportation is
asking students to vote on the pro-
posal and has established a Web site
where students can cast their ballots
until April 14. Students are not
allowed to vote on which of the two
fee increase options they would pre-
fer, only whether they approve of the
proposal itself.

If students approve the proposal,
parking and transportation will
chose one of the fee-increase
options.

According to Harkins, the
University has no backup plan if stu-
dents vote against the proposal, but

CWO organizes campus march

Christal Hall

Staff Writer

Some members of the Campus
Women’s Organization literally lost
their shoes on Friday evening while
taking back the night for the safety of
women on campus and around the
world.

Members of the CWO, the
Rainbow Alliance, the Feminist
Collective and NARAL (National
Abortion Rights Action League)
marched around campus. Along the
way some of the marchers’ shoes fell
off, while others became tired and
thirsty.

The annual demonstration began
at the William Pitt Union on Bigelow
Boulevard. The procession trekked
up University Drive, passed
Sutherland Hall and Pitt Stadium and
Lothrop Hall, and back to Fifth
Avenue. After receiving many honks
and thumbs-up, they continued on
Fifth Avenue through the Towers
Lobby and up Forbes Avenue to
Bigelow Boulevard then concluded
at the union.

CWO Co—president Kelli
Paterson said six weeks of planning
goes into an event like this. She said
getting permits, security and renting
a speaker can grow tiresome but that
the cause is worth it.

In the wake of several publicized
cases of sexual assault at Pitt, the
protest showed how serious the mat-
ter is and that women aren’t going to
stand for it any longer, according to
Paterson.

Paterson said she doesn’t under-
stand why Pitt created its Sexual
Assault Services only five years ago
when it was needed long ago.

The event started around 6:45
p.m. with speaker Anne Forrest, an
education and training specialist at
the Pittsburgh Action Against Rape.

She describes sexual assault as a big
monster that can be survivable.

Forrest, herself a survivor of sex-
ual assault, said there was no place
she could escape assault while grow-
ing up. She was assaulted at home,
school, church and on vacation.

By the time she reached the age
of 18, she was raped or assaulted by
10 different people, including her
mother, father, uncle, two school jan-
itors and a stranger.

“At first I thought there was
something wrong with me,” Forrest
said, “but then I realized that there’s
something wrong with our society.”

Forrest said 60 to 80 percent of
sexual assault is committed by some-
one the victim knows.

She said the effects of sexual
assault can vary from person to per-
son and that they will continue until
the victim gets counseling. She
explained that sexual assault not only
damages the body but also the spirit
and soul. Its basic symptoms are
depression, anxiety, problems with
intimacy, phobias, panic attacks,
self—injury and low self-esteem.

Forrest played songs by the Fat
Boys and Nancy Daye to inform the
audience about the severity of sexual
assault. She also chanted several
empowerment phrases, including the
evening’s theme: “Take back the
night, the time is here! We will not be
controlled by fear! Join together, free
our lives! We will not be victim-
ized!”

She said society has been caught
up in the myth of “It was her fault
because she was wearing this or
that.”

‘‘I didn’t ask to be assaulted,”
Forrest said.

“When you look at [the fact that]
a quarter of women are being raped,”
Forrest said, “it’s something wrong
with our culture — not the victims.”

AcqyITTAL

McMullen’s attorney, David
Shrager, said all the evidence that
was relevant to the case was present-
ed to the jury.

“The jury heard the facts against
Kirk McMullen  and I think the
verdict was absolutely an appropriate
verdict,” he said.

Shrager said Arango’s testimony
was directly “contradicted by two
young women — two other witnesses
who had no bias and no interest in the
case.”

The women corroborated
McMullen’s testimony by saying that
as they approached the party, they
saw him outside fending off five or
six Phi Kappa Theta fraternity broth-
ers as they kicked and punched him,
according to Shrager.

As the jury announced the ver-
dict, two female jury members cried,
according to Arango. He said the jury
was deadlocked for most of the day
and that he believed the women gave
in to the rest of the jury and decided
onthe acquittal.

“From O.J. to McMullen, all the
football players get of ,” Arango
said.

According to Arango, Shrager
portrayed McMullen as sober that

night as he tried to pick up his broth-

FROM PAGE 1

er from the party. ‘

Arango said McMullen was
drunk when he came to Phi Kappa
Theta’s door and turned violent when
the members wouldn’t let him in.

The party‘ was thrown by Phi
Kappa Theta and Pi Kappa Phi,
Arango said. McMullen is not a
member of either fraternity and was-
n’t on the guest list, he added.

Although he was acquitted of the
assault charges, the jury convicted
McMullen of defiant trespass, and he
was consequently sentenced to one
year’s probation.

Ron Wahl, spokesman for Pitt’s
Athletics Department, said
McMullen has been reinstated to the
football team.

“I trust [Coach Harris’] ability to
be fair in balancing a judgement by
the jury,” said Shrager in discussing
any actions that Head Coach Walt
Harris might take when considering
McMullen’s future with the football
team.

After the incident, Harris sus-
pended McMul1en from playing or
practicing with the football team.

Arango said both he and Johnson
are pursuing civil cases against
McMullen. But, he said, they won’t
come to trial until at least 1999.

FREE RIDE

he did say that the U-zone plan will
remain intact. -

The Student Government Board,
the University Senate, the Graduate
Professional Student Association and
the Resident Student Association
endorse the proposal.

Harkins declined to disclose the

anticipated cost of the proposal, say-
ing he needed to leave himself room
for final negotiations with PAT.
_ He did say, however, that an offer
PAT made five years ago for the same
service was in the $6 million-a-year
range.

Students would pay 90 percent of
the cost under the proposal, and the
University would pick up the remain-
ing 10 percent of the cost to provide
the serviceto faculty and staff.

University Senate President

Gordon MacLeod said the Senate was -

“favorably impressed” by the propos-
al because of the opportunities it
would offer students.

“Students could go anywhere,”
he said. “If a student lives in the
North Hills, he could keep a job he
might have there and ride back and
forth from Oakland for free. They
[students] could go to the malls or the
airport. The plan would give them
mobility.”

Student Ryan Hines agreed. “I
would probably do it [vote yes],” he

FROM PAGE 1

said. “I ride the bus a lot.”

Hines said that to pay for a
monthly bus pass would cost him
$30, which equates to $120 a semes-
ter. Pitt’s proposal would save him
money.

But student Angela Gormley said
she would likely vote against the pro-
posal.

“It’s not worth that much
money,” she said. “I rarely go around
to someplace where I need to ride the
bus — every once in a while, but not
that often.”

Gormley said she could save
money by just paying the fare when
she does ride a PAT bus.

At this point, the Chancellor’s
Office, the Provost’s Office and the
Parking and Transportation
Committee have approved the pro-
posal. If students back the plan,
Harkins will take it to the Board of
Trustees for its approval.

Parking and transportation hopes
to have the plan implemented by the
fall 1998 semester.

But, Harkins said, it is student
support that is most critical for the
proposal’s success.

“We can’t go forward without it,”
he said.

Across the‘Nation

DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. — A man
who was there says it wasn’t an Easter
egg hunt —— it was an Easter egg mas-
sacre. _

It happened yesterday at a park in
Daytona Beach. About 5,000 people
showed up for a church—sponsored egg
hunt, but many of them rushed a pile of
thousands of colored eggs.

Eggs got trampled, and so did some
of the kids.

One woman who brought her chil-
dren says she was shocked at how some
parents behaved. She says she saw a
woman stealing eggs out of a child’s
basket. ‘

Church officials say next year,
they’ll make sure parents understand
it’s an event for children. But they still
think the event was a success.

SAN FRANCISCO — The principal
wants grades to rise at a San Francisco
high school, but that prospect has tem-
pers rising. ‘

Teachers at Balboa High School
are irate about a memo urging them to
increase the number of passing grades
by 5 percent.

The memo obtained by the San
Francisco Chronicle says teachers

Iiilclr-en trampled in

   

should increase the combined total of
all A’s, B’s and C’s.

The principal denies she’s pushing
grade inﬂation. She says the memo is
just part of an effort to help urban teens
stay in school. 2

Still, teachers call it insulting, and
many say they’ll ignore it.

PITTSBURGH —- Fans of “Mr.

and trademark tennis shoes.

Parents and kids alike can enjoy the

adults, along with the play areafor the
kids.

The exhibit will travel to 50 chil-
dren’s museums around the country

late Thursday, after taking alcohol and
pills. The report says he’d beeniunder-
going a drug withdrawal program.

Pilatus was a former model who

like “Girl, You Know It’s True,”
“Blame It" on the Rain” and “All or

 Courts, not public
opinion, decide low

i The Paula Jones sexual misconduct suit was thrown
‘ out of court last week, but ﬂie battle isenot over for
; President Clinton and his lawyers. ,

’ Kenneth Starr is continuing his investigation of
whether Clinton attempted to obstruct justice in the
Jones case, and the president must still defend himself
against those charges, even though a Washington Post

‘ poll yesterday shows most Americans would rather for-
get about the whole incident. _

Many of those interviewed by the Post would prefer
seeing Clinton get back to the business of running ﬂie
poirarlitry and allow him to forget about all these pesky

eg matters.

i public's whims. . _

White House lawyers are still trying to gain execu-

l tive privilege — the freedom not to testify under oath ——

j for Clinton, his aides, and even for his wife, Hillary.

, It is entirely possiblethatthesewhite House lawyers
are just stalling. They may fully expect their requests for
executive privilege to be shot down by the court, and
they seem to be working on a let's-stall-as-long—as—possi-

P ble-and-hope-the-issue-cools-down defense, which has

so far worked with the American public.

But if the court accepts the claim of privilege in this
investigation, it will have successfully spat on all the
lofty principles the framers of our Constitution intended.

I ' White House lawyers argue that this investigation is

 an official government matter because it aﬁects the

l ofﬁce of the presidency. Yet our founding fathers never
intended for the chief executive's office to be an untouch-

l able kingship. If anything, they were looking to get as far

'. as they could away from a throne of immunity when

E they sought a democratic government.

' If the Constitution's framers had intended anything

like executive privilege when they drafted that docu-

 ment, it was solely for the purpose of protecting the

. They certainly did not mean for the president, his
wife or his aides to be above the law. Nor did they mean
for the fate of the chief executive to be decided by peo-
ple watching the TV news instead of by the due process

E guaranteed to everybody else.

A stereotypical Pittsburgh first date

James Maude

columnist

Admit it, men: Like me, you
keep your ﬁrst dates in Pittsburgh to a

strict formula. You'd feel a lot better if i

there were a book to help you if
you're inexperienced, but a popular
cliche is as good as a written guide-
book.

On the night in question, you
meet the lady (or girl, depending on
how she views herself, not how you
perceive her) at a neutral location,
e.g., in front of the Hillman Library or
the ﬁont entrance of the William Pitt
Union, but varying it somewhat so
you don't bump into your ﬁiends who
are most likely following your date
regimen.

You take her in your Uncle
Vmcenzds Lexus I_.S400, and pray to
God that a police ir1forrnant's corpse
is not lying in the trunk You hide the
Sepultura CDs, which you played on
the way there, in the glove compart-
ment and nine in to ,WQED FM,
which you play on the way as you
churn out introductory conversation
such as, "Did Dr. Perlotfs lecture
today in logic class just go over your
head?" or "That [luminous green]
cardigan looks great on you, and
matches your shoes [14—hole Doc
Martens], which blend in beautifully
with your hair [she was brunette, but
now blond]."

You drive up to Mt. Washington,
because your friends say it's a great
place to "impress the chicks," even
though, chances are, she went there
on a ﬁrst date with a previous
boyfriend. You drive up to one of
those restaurants with valet parking,
get out, and ask the valet attendant to
park your car in "the usual spo "
After he tells you to go f-—- yourself
and drives off, you proceed inside the

restaurant You are seated by the wiri-
dow, which has a nice view of the
city. You order beverages, and you try
to hide the pain as you order the food.

In the -meantime, like in the car,
the conversation consists of nothing
more than menial murnblings, anec-
dotes, half—witted observations and
reminiscences. You talk about your
ﬁiend who only last week walked
into a synagogue, drunk out of his
mind, carrying a bottle of Vladimir
vodka and wearing orange-lens sun-
glasses and Bermuda shorts, shout-
ing, "Dude, I'm f-—in' like feeling like
a mofo and s—-t!" She talks about her‘
youth when she used to dress up as a
leprechaun on St. Patrick's Day. You
try not to yawn too much.

The food comes, and you put on
your best table rrianners. You talk
about Calli Bodnafs 9.7 season aver-
age on the ﬂoor event for the Pitt
gyrrmastics team. She talks about her
promiscuous roommate. You talk
about past sporting achievements
(even though it may only be Most
Painful Fractured Hurnerus in Rugby
for 1993). She talks about her past
boyfriends (like me, you are annoyed
by women's insistence that they talk
about these creeps). And most impor-
tantly, throughout dinner, you refrain
from staring at her chest too much.

political equality, not
just economic

Last Monday, a columnist for this
paper wrote an article in critical com-
memoration of the sesquicentennial of
the "Manifesto of the Communist
Party." I was glad to be reminded of the
pamphlet that I had first read four years
ago, inspiring me to a new perspective
in my discipline —— political science.

It is difficult to explain just why I, a
non-Marxist, noncommunist, even a
nonsocialist, would feel so indebted to
this work, but perhaps explaining this
feeling might illustrate why such a
"shortsighted" idea has held so much
hope, inspiration and passion for so
, many of its readers.

The question is not, as Paul Clark
may have asked, how such a cruel, coer-
cive work could be written and believed,
but rather how Marx and Engels could

,.come to the conclusion they did, looking
at the present and glimpsing at the

P ‘ future.

Marx and Engels are two students
turned teachers who bestowed upon
future students what understanding of
society they had gained in their own
experiences. Perhaps this was their
greatest accomplishment: Marx and
Engels refused to limit their teaching to

’Manifes_to.’spol(e -ol  

some previously established hierarchy

of intellects and university-types.

They succeeded in getting their
message to the general public —— the
uneducated public. Marx and Engels

were largely responsible for introducing.

women, oppressed peoples, the poor —-
in short, all groups that were considered
inferior by property—owning white
males ——— to the world of politics, before
the Powers That Be would permit it.
They felt, and rightly so, that any con-
cept of the political outside these

‘groups, together making up the great

majority of humankind (in 1848 and

today), was a false, pretentious, and.

extremely "shoitsighted" one.

The responsibility of what was actu-
ally accomplished —— or destroyed ——— in
the name of Marx and Engels by Lenin,
Stalin, Mao and others can only in part
be placed on the shoulders of these two
great fathers. But that "in part" is not
enough reason to ignore the great poten-
tial of humanity which they released:

Nearly all of us believe strongly that

We live in a society in which
women, on average, still make 25 per-

ed.

We live in a society that values the

precious right to bear arms and collect

stockpiles of weapons to exercise it
"freedom." . '
When we take a good look at our-
selves and our values and our creeds, it
is easy to see why such an atrocity can
occur. Perhaps we _ should rethink what
is truly important andieiljeneﬁcial to our
communities instead of embracing

- benighted individualism.

We carmot bring back those people
from the massacre in Jonesboro, but
through respect for each other and
humanitarianism, we can try to prevent
it from happening again.

Womack, Lytle
show promise
in scrimmage

From the looks of Saturday’s Blue-
Gold game, a few questions about next
year’s Panther football squad may have
been answered, but many more still
remain.

First, the Good:

The quarterback race became a little
clearer, for now. Matt Lytle didn’t shine
from behind center on Saturday, but his
six touchdown passes and 322 yards
passing can’t be ignored.

Lytle also improvised well on the
run against the onslaught of Panther
defenders. At the start of the third quar-
ter, Lytle scrambled left, directed Terry
Murphy to go up the sideline with his
free hand and then heaved a pass to
Murphy for a touchdown.

Quarterbacks Tony Zimmerman and
Matt O’Conner didn’t fare well. They
overthrew and missed receivers all day,
but they also suffered routine pressure
from Pitt’s defensive line. O’Conner, a
recent transfer, appeared to have trouble
running the offense, and Zimmerman
couldn’t handle the continuous defen-
sive pressure.

With receiver Jake Hoffart gone, a
steady second receiver will be needed to
run Pitt’s passing offense. Senior Jackie
Womack displayed the bursts of speed
for which he was recruited on a first-
quarter reverse and fourth—quarter bomb.
The reverse was called back on a hold,
but Womack’s 20-yard dance down the
right sideline was one of the day’s few
crisp offensive plays.

After Zimmerman was tackled for a
safety to put the defense up 36-28 with
under a minute to play, Womack hauled
in a 80-yard touchdown pass. On the
play, Womack simply used his speed to
split the safety and comer to break wide
open by the time the ball from Lytle fell
into his hands. On the two point conver-
sion, Womack again broke wide open in
the comer to tie the score at 36.

Sophomore Nick Cole started at
linebacker beside Phil Clarke. He fero-
ciously stopped the run and repeatedly
banged tight ends to the turf on crossing
patterns all day.

The entire defensive unit played
well despite late lapses in the secondary.
The running game was barely visible as
the defense tore through Pitt’s offensive
line. In the first half the defense forced
seven punts including four three—and-
outs and led 27-14.

Offense, defense lie in Blue-Gold game

Brian Knavlsh

Staff Wrlter

The ﬁrst chapter in the battle to become
Pitt’s starting quarterback next season didn’t
have much suspense, as ﬁfth-year senior
Matt Lytle outshined his other challengers
Tony Zirmnerman and Matt O’Conner in
Saturday’s Blue-Gold scrimmage.

Lytle, who was the team’s starter for
much of 1996, connected on 17 of 30 passes
for 322 yards and all six of the garne’s touch-
downs as the olfense (the Gold) battled back
to tie the defense 43-43 in overtime.

“I’m happy with what happened out
here today,” Lytle said after the game. “It

was a good spring scrimmage, but that’s all
it was, a scrimmage. We have a long way to
go.”

Lytle has the athletic ability to be a suc-
cessful starting quarterback, and during this
olf-season he put the time and work into
learning the complicated offense to make the
most of his ﬁnal season.

“Ever since the end of the bowl game
I’ve made a commitment to work as hard as
I can, to watch as much ﬁlm as possible,” he
explained

Lytle’s favorite targets were returning
All-Big East receiver Terry Murphy, who
caught three touchdowns, and sophomore
speedster Jackie Womack, who caught two

touchdowns and a two-point conversion.

Womackwillbe askedto step up andﬁll
the huge void left at the receiver position
opposite Murphy, where Jake Hoﬁfart had a
record-breaking year for the Panthers last
season.

“I just want to take some pressure oil“ of
Terry and contribute to the team,” Womack
said of his new role.

But other than those two, the receivers
pool is very thin.

“We have two scholarship receivers and
some other knuckleheads out there who

Other than the Lytle-to-Murphy and -

points for tumovers, safeties and forcing the

The defensive line pressured the three

just seven of 15 completions for 88 yards
and Zimmerman to four of seven for 39
yards.

They also held the day’s leading rusher

prowess. With last year’s starter Grant
Cofﬁeld off the team these two don’t
seem to be the answer. Despite no
oncoming rush, the punters traded 30-
yard punts all day and never drilled a
true spiral.

Ben Kopp was converted from
offensive line to tight end because of his
size, but did anyone think about some
hands? Kopp started the day dropping
passes in pregame and continued
throughout the scrimmage. But, this is
all new to him, and on several of his pass
routes he was drilled by a Pitt line-
backer. ‘

Finally, the Ugly.

Without a doubt the offensive line
was the disappointment of the scrim-
mage. Missing three starters from last

year who graduated, it seemed over- _

matched on nearly every play. The
longest run was nine yards, and many
ball carriers were stopped for losses.
Even when rushing only four lineman,
the Panther defense still achieved pres-
sure on the quarterback.

The defense outplayed the unpol-
ished offense on Saturday despite the tie.
And in summary, Saturday was a disap-
pointrnent.
