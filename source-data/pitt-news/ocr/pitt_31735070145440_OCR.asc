SGB members disagree over PPC funding

Carla Trinca- Conley
Staﬁ"Wri ter

In their first controversial meet-
ing of the year, Student Govern-
ment Board members disagreed
over a proposal to give Pitt Pro-
gram Council extra money for
Bigelow Bash.

Board President Charlie Shull
proposed a potential budget
modiﬁcation of $4,500 for PPC,
but the rest of the Board denied
the allocations request in a 7—to—1
vote, with David Gau abstaining
from the vote. ,

While Shull proposed the extra
money would go to Pitt Program
Council and help fund Bigelow

Bash, other members said the ~

money would be better used back
in the Student Activities Fund.

, PPC is a formula group, mean— A

ing it has a speciﬁc amount of
funding for each year. The group
may only work with a set amount
of money for the entire school

year, Shull said.

Shull argued the allocated
money would be “very much
in line” with other events the
Board has supported in previ-
ous years.

He proposed allocated funds
—— left over from decisions to re-
move diversity committee and
not to fund $2,000 for PPC’s bon-
ﬁre last year — would be used to
help fund this weekend’s upcom-

ing carnival hosted by the PPC. '

Shull said he wanted to see
the carnival, which PPC extended
from one to three days this year,
become “a new tradition” for Pitt
students.

Board member Ali Noorbaksh
did not support the proposed
budget modiﬁcation.

Noorbaksh said the allocated
funds appeared to be a sponsor-
ship, where PPC could use the
funds for anything it wanted.
Shull said the situation was more
like “co-sponsorship.” Noor-

baksh said he thought there was

no way SGB could ﬁnd out that ‘

the money went to the carnival

‘ company hired by PPC.

Noorbaksh said PPC receives
38 percent of the Student Activi-
ties Fee —— $813,8o0’annually —
and he “doesn’t think SGB should
pick upthe extra slack.”

Board member Phil LaRue
said hehas seen “frowning, sad
or even crying faces” leaving'SGB
-meetings because the Board had
to deny groups money. ’

Instead of giving the money to
PPC and allowing it to roll back
into the Student Activites Fund,
it would “beneﬁt students in an
inﬁnite number of ways,” LaRue
said.

He said the carnival would
come to Pitt, whether PPC re-
ceived- the $4,500 or not.

Advertising for the event on
the PPC website states student
fees for an all—day wristband as
.$5 and $2 for individual rides.

Shull said he had previously
talked with members of the PPC
about the funding for the event
and “toldthem the money was
coming.” ' - ‘

Kyle Miller, executive board’

director of Pitt Program Coun-
cil, said the denial of the bud-
get modiﬁcation will not affect
the student cost during Bigelow
Bash. ' .

Miller was “not at liberty” to
say where the other sources of

5 funding came from.

Shull, who said he originally
thought he had the Board’s sup-
port on the pending vote three
weeks ago, said he became aware
of an actual lack of support last
Week. . _

Noorbaksh, the Board’s busi-
ness manager, did not submit the

' request last week.

Shull said it was Board mem-
ber Noorbaksh’s “personal deci-
sion.” '

Shull said he was “disappoint-

ed, but respects the Board mem-
bers of their principles.”

He said he supports the Board
members and thought they had
sound judgment.

Researchers find way to fight chemical, biological weapons

Pitt and UPMC’s McGowan Institute for Regenerative Medicine discover a material that could reduce weapons’ effects.

Johannajones
_ For The Pitt News

Pitt researchers have created a
material that can neutralize some
effects of chemical and biological
weapons.

Researchers created the ma-
terial out of polymers, or long
strains of molecules, in a study
published last month.

“This mesh could be developed
into sponges, coatings or liquid

V sprays, and it could be_used in-

ternally or as a wound dressing
that is capable of killing bacte-
ria, viruses and spores,” Richard
Koepsel said in a news release.
Koepsel, a co-author of the
study, is also a professor in the
UPMC ‘Department of Surgery.
. For example, the polymer can
be used like a bandage.

‘Richard Koepsel:

“This mesh could

be developed into  
sponges, coatings or
liquid sprays.”

“You would wrap yourself in it,
use a little water and it would help
[neutralize] what you’ve already
come in contact with,” he said.

The material is thin and V
stretchy, similar to a latex glove, ‘

he said. g . -
Researchers also think it could
be placed inhazmat suits or in

graduate or professional student at
the University of Pittsburgh.”

David Givens, chair of the Assem-
bly’s Elections Committee, said the
committee has been reviewing the
board’s bylaws forseveral months
to make sure that all eligible students
were given the opportunity to run
for oﬁ"1ce, including undergraduate
students who would be graduate stu-

dents in the fall and wanted to run-

for positions. He said that the com-
rnittee did not change its bylaws. It
did not anticipate this controversy,
he said, adding that the board might
want to address the issue ata future
meeting. ‘

Daniel Jimenez, the current As-
sembly president, said, “Theelection
is deﬁnitely something that needs to
be dismissed. We should look at the
bylaws because something needs to
be changed”,

The Assembly’s bylaws say that

4 if it wants to pass an amendments,

it must a two-thirds majority vote
from all of the Assembly members.‘
“The amendment must be read in

4 ﬁnal form at a regularly scheduled

Assembly meeting at least two weeks
beforethe vote takes place.”

“Amendments in section num-
bering require a two-thirds vote of
bylaws committee members at an an-
nounced bylaws committee meeting
and be presented to the Assembly
Board for ﬁnal approval at the next
regularly scheduled Assembly Board
meeting.” ' ’

An Assembly Board meetingwill
take place tonight in the Room 527
of the William‘ Pitt Union from 6 to
7:30 p.m.

But this idea didn’t seem to calm
down théother candidates.

McDaniel, a student in the law
school and Graduate School of Pub-
lie and International Affairs, said in
an e-mail to the Assembly members
yesterday that he would like to see
the Elections Committee follow the
current bylaws. A

“In order to resolve the issue
I recommend that the Assembly
Board rules Ms. Devanath is .not a
valid candidate,” he said in the e-mail.
“The Elections Committee should

be expected to‘ follow the rules that

have been democratically decided
on by the Assembly Board, i.e. the
by-laws.” ‘ _ V

Givens said that McDaniel is un-
der the impression that the Assem-
bly Board and Elections Committee
are two separate entities because he
addresses why the two are not cor-
responding about the election con-
troversy. The Elections Committee is
composed primarily ofthe Assembly
Board. ‘ »

The bylaws do not say anything
about whether Pleso, who is study-
ing math in the School of Arts and
Sciences, and McDaniel"could contest

the election, though neither said they V

would if they could.

“I don’tthinkthere is any point in
formally contesting,” Pleso said. “If
they don’t want to follow the bylaws,
then I’m not sure thatlwant to belong
to GPSA.” .

McDaniel says that contestjngwill

not prove anything, but that the As-

sembly Board needs to address why
it diverged from its bylaws.

Devanath says that the outcome.

will be positive for her no matterwhat

material to help clean up areas that need
to be sanitized after attacks. Koepsel said
he thinks manufacturers could place the
material in a sponge and use it to wipe
surfaces.

He" said the material won’t work for all
chemical or biological weapon attacks.

“If the concentration is high enough,
you can’t really do much,” he said.

Duquesne professorjohn Sawicki said

that the development comes at a good
time. T

“Given the recent surge in pandemic
threats and the international notice of
highly destructive, contagious illnesses,
a new, ﬂexible chemical and biological
[weapon] resistant material would be very
useful,” said Sawicki, who teaches counter-
terrorism. .

Koepsel said the next step is to ﬁnd
someone to manufacture the material.

The material is expensive - Koepsel
didn’t know the price range because it

_ would depend upon the industry and the

company making it —— but can be quickly
produced, he said.

He predicted that the military and emer-
gency response services would be the larg-
est consumers of the material if it makes it
to the market, whereas the bandages could
be sold to private citizens if the areas they
live in are attacked by chemical or biologi-
cal weapons. ‘ —

, The polymers are ﬂexible enough that
they can attach to similar polymers found in

chemical and biological weapons, allowing" ,

the material to neutralize the substances in
the weapons. The neutralizing material acts
much like an ointment does on an injury.

the decision is.

“If I’m not president, thatwill give me time to
concentrate on my ﬁrst year of medical school,”
Devanath said.

She said she’s not surprised by the contro-
versy. '

“I knewbeinganundergraduate and running
for a graduate student position, I would take a
lot of heat,” she said.

Devanath does not appear to be the ﬁrst
undergraduate student to run for GPSA ofﬁce.

In a previous interview, Givens said two
undergraduate students who were preparing
to attend Pitt’s graduate schools ran for oﬂice
in 2003.

In his April 6 e—mail, McDaniel made said
the two undergraduate students were Nicole
King and Lindsay Howard. He said their elec-
tions occurred in spring 2003. Both women
graduated in 2005 and Kingwas in athree-year
program and Kingwas in afour-year program.
He concluded that they could not have been
undergraduate students when they ran for of-
ﬁce.

Givens said to The Pitt News yesterday that
he didn’t know to address McDaniel’s concerns
about the two women.

McDaniel said the only mention of under-
graduates as oﬁicers is in the minutes of a Uni-
versity Senate Council meeting from 2003. He

says that what is unclear is that it refers to King
and Howard completing their undergraduate
degrees at Pitt, not that they were currently
undergraduate students. I

Many of the Assembly members interviewed
said they didn’t understand why Devanath’s
candidacy was so controversial.

“It seemed that the electionwaswon inafair
way and [McDaniel] is trying to make something
out of nothing,” said Assembly representative
Mark Donnelly, who voted for Devanath.

  Contra vers y surprises assembly

McDaniel said, “This is not about Nila as a
person, but about the relationship between the
graduate students and the administration.”

Devanath received 273 votes, whereas Mc-
Daniel received 159 and Pleso received 53. About
600 students voted in the election, which was
open to about 10,000 graduate and professional
students. This turnout is similar to last year’s.

Devanath is scheduled to take over as presi-
dent May 1. Undergraduate commencement is
scheduled for May 2.

Cameras are
worth the cost

ig Brother doesn’t always

B bite. And neither do the city’s

recent hopes of installing a

legion of surveillance cameras, even
considering the public price tag.

The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette

reports that Pittsburgh, Carnegie
Mellon and the Community College
of Allegheny County jointly ﬁled re-
quests for $12 million to $14 million
in federal stimulus money to install
a new system of police surveillance
cameras. ’ '
_ They plan to use the funds to
purchase 220 cameras and develop
the software and wireless network-
ing systems that run them. These
networking systems would bring
wireless Internet into Pittsburgh
police squad cars and end the po-
lice’s expensive contract with Sprint
—— potentially saving thousands of
city dollars — and of course, im-
prove at-a-distance monitoring.

When examined on a case-by-
case basis, security cameras offer
a clear advantage in hastening the
judicial process.]ust last Thursday,
security camera footage aided of-
ﬁcers in apprehending two teen-
agers charged with murdering a
retired ﬁreﬁghter, the Post—Gazette
reports. Police hope the expanded
surveillance system will lead to
more successes, and such hope has
solid grounding.

When comparing the costs of
their installation with resultant
reductions in crime and court
costs, however, cameras have had
a more difficult case to make. In
fact, little comprehensive research
on the effectiveness of modern
public surveillance exists. One of
the prominent studies, released in
2005 by the British Home Ofﬁce,
put cameras’ beneﬁts in doubt.
Collecting data over one year at 13

English municipalities possessing ,

high concentrations of cameras,
researchers could attribute crime
rate reduction to the surveillance

system in only one town. For cam-.

eras to have actually fought crime
and not run a deﬁcit, the study said,
they had to be placed in hard-to-
replicate conditions.

But evaluators of Pittsburgh’s
camera initiative shouldn’t be dis-
couraged —-— there are stark differ-
ences between the crime dynamic
of English boroughs and that of
large metropolitan areas. Despite
rising skepticism abroad, police
departments of major U.S. cities
such as Phoenix, New York and
Chicago have increased their sur-
veillance capacities over the last
decade, according to Howard A.
Stern, Pittsburgh’s chief informa-
tion officer.

Chicago’s camera system recent-
ly underwent its own cost—analysis
study by the Washington—based
Urban Institute this past year, and
according to a March 30 ABC? re-
port, Chicago cameras are effective
crime ﬁghters. “[For] every dollar

spent on cameras, there was over .

a $2 savingsin terms of the money
that was averted for the crimes
that were prevented,” Dr. Nancy
Lavigne, director of the institute’s
justice policy center, said

With Pitt police cameras already
overseeing the Schenley Quad
and campus buildings, spreading
more cameras across Pittsburgh
shouldn’t be too intrusive, and
neither would they infringe upon
constitutional rights. And as long
as city officials collaborate with
their Chicagoan counterparts, the
proposal could potentially create
jobs, reduce crime and save money
over time.

Columnist

A U.S. districtjudge in San Francisco

ruled last Wednesday that the Na-

tional Security Agency’s program of
warrantless wiretaps of American
phone and e-mail conversations
is illegal, The New York Times re-

ported. Created secretly by the Bush
administration in the days after 9/11,

the NSA surveillance program was

the subject of countless attacks by
prominent Democrats who called it
unconstitutional and illegal.

As a Democratic senator cam-
paigning for president, Barack
Obama made one such attack when
he promised to abandon the “false
choice between the liberties we cher-
ish and the security we provide.” In-
deed, Obama’s rhetoric echoed the
sentiment of voters who, a 2007
ACLU poll showed, widely opposed
the Bush wiretap program by a mar-
gin of 61 to 35 percent.

As clear-cut as the polls and the
rhetoric were, Obama reversed his
position mid-campaign and voted
for the 2008 overhaul of the Foreign
Intelligence Surveillance Act that le-
galized much of the Bush wiretap
program and granted retroactive im-
munity to the telecom companies
that helped the Bush administration
spy on Americans.

When Obama assumed the presi-
dency, he continued to make use of
the warrantless surveillance pro-
gram and even violated the limits
ofthe very law he voted forin2008.
Today, “Obama’s administration now
relies heavily on such surveillance in
its ﬁght against Al Qaeda,” The New
York Times reported.

Importantly, not only did Presi-
dent Obama continue to use the
Bush-era surveillance program
that he denounced as a senator, his
administration even employed the
same legal arguments used by Bush’s
Department ofjustice to defend the

program in court.

Wiretap furthers evidence
against ‘change’    

For example, in the case above, an

Islamic charity alleged that the NSA‘

illegally listened to phone conver-

sations between the charity and its I

lawyers without obtainingawarrant.
Rather than argue over the program’s

' legality, the Obama Administration

copied a play from the Bush admin-
istration and attempted to assert the
state secrets privilege, arguing that
discussing the case in court jeopar-
dized national security.

These similarities in the security
policies and legal strategies of the
Bush and Obama administrations are
illustrative of one important point:
Government, no matter which party
is in control, is rarely willing to re-
linquish powers it has accumulated
whether those powers were attained
legally or illegally.

Although the differences between
Republicans and Democrats might
appear stark in light of health care

' reform, we should not be fooled into

believingthat either party is commit-
ted to restoringAmerican liberty. For

IT'S PRONOUNCED ‘LEE’

U.S. can’t repeat the tragic tale of ‘Jamerica’

 
  

Columnist

Once there was a country called

-~-Jamerica. In Jamerica, people drove

cars, and those cars rolled around on
tires. Sometimes the tires slid out of
control or blew out. And when a tire
failed, lives were lost.

Not every tire carried the same
risks, though. P_ren1ium tires didn’t
fail as often as standard tires, but they
cost more. Also, wear and tear raised
the risk of tire failure.

Socially, there were problems
with this situation. Somejamericans
couldn’t afford periodic tire replace-
ments or premium tires. When a
seeminglyﬁneﬁrewore outunexpect-
edly, the driver would have to drop a
bunch of money on anew tire, which

' just didn’t seemfair. '

So far,]america mirrors America.

' ‘Here’s the differencezjamericans de-

cided to do something about the tire
situation. Thejamerican government
armounced it would pay for new tires
whenever necessary. *

‘ This new program was popular.

Lewis Lehe_

Taxes rose a little bit, but no one
minded because tire failure killed
fewer people.
After awhile, though,thingsbegan
to change.
Change one: Whereas, before,
Jamericans sometimes bought the
standard tires and_othertimes bought
the premium tires, with the deal in
place they began to only pick out pre-
mium tires. In fact, standard tires were
suddenly considered unsafe — even
though almost everyone had bought
the standard tires in the past. Premi-

. um tires were suddenly considered

necessary. ,
Change two: New types of tires
came out on the market. They were
more expensive than what had previ-
ouslybeen considered premiumtires,
and they were a little safer. The tire
manufacturers had always been able
to make these new tires, but, before
the tire replacement program, they
knew that not  drivers would
be  to pay extra for the small
boost in safety. Pretty soon, every
sénsiblejamerican got the new tires.
And once everybodyhadthe newtires,
they too were suddenly considered

necessary. ‘

Change Three: Drivers started re-
placing their tires more often. «Tires
don’t just go from “perfect” to “bald.”
There is a gradient And as you move
down that gradient — even from

A “perfect” to “very, very good” — the

chance of failure takes one step up
the staircase of statistical risk. So tire
installers just started telling everyone
to get their tires replaced whenever
therewasexiIatimetodothejob.And
once everybody started getting their
tires replaced more often, changing
your tires frequently was suddenly
considered necessary as well.

Like waves in the ocean, the three
changes started to pile up and rein-
force 'each other. But this piling up
was so slow that ordinary Jameri-
cans never perceived any change at

‘ all. In fact, when ordinaryjamericans

thought about the old days before the
new policy, they didn’t even remem-
ber that tires back then were more
dangerous and that drivers changed
tires less often. L

The combined cost of the three
changes strained _]america’s federal
budget. Atﬁrst, the government raised

taxes. But, after apoint, thejamericans
rejectedtaxhikes. So,_]american politi-
cianscutothergovemmentprograms
—— education, public parks, conserva-
tion efforts, scientiﬁc research and
other programs not essential for
survival.

But as the cost of tire replacement
climbed even higher,]american politi-
cians had to cut programs that saved
lives —food stamps, police protection
and even maintenance for the roads
beneath thejamericans’ tires.

One politicianproposedasolution;
An expert panel would use cost as a
criteria to decide if the government
paid for a given tire replacement. The
horriﬁed Jamericans voted him out,
because they didn’t want any “death
panels.” This unfeeling politician
dared to put a price on life, which is
priceless. A

Jamerica went bankrupt. Jameri-
cans died en masse ﬁ'om crime, hun-
ger and collapsing bridges. *

THE END .

This parable relates to health insur-
ance — government health insurance,
speciﬁcally, but it could cover private
health insurance if you substitute “in-

9,

surance premiums” for “taxes.

Notice that nojamericans do any-
thing wrong: The government keeps
its promises. Consumers keep their
families safe. Tire manufacturers
keep the market supplied. Everyone
involved thought everything they
did was “necessary.” Nor are there
any equivalents for our scapegoats:
Illegals didn’t use up all the tires. Tire
replacement companies didn’t gorge
on proﬁts. Fear of malpractice suits
didn’t drive urmecessary tire replace-
merits.

But, somehow, the result was di-
saster.

Americans have painful reali-
ties to face. Newer, pricier medical
treatments come out every month.
Some treatments (like the polio vac-
cine) are cheap and world-changing,
but others (like some cancer drugs)
costafortune and only lengthen alife
by a few weeks in many cases. The
condition that insurance only covers
what’s “necessary” is no condition at
all, when the deﬁnition of necessary
is endlessly elastic.

Shrinking

. this reason, as I think about the 2010

elections, I ﬁnd myselfunable to feel
too enthusiastic about the possibility
of a Republican resurgence.

After all, the party that gave us
warrantless surveillance in the ﬁrst
place gives us few signs that it‘un-
derstands the lessons of the Bush
era and even fewer that it is willing
to apply them. It is still the party that
would restrict abortion rights, stag-
nate LGBT rights and sacriﬁce liberty
to ensure temporary security.

posed to expanding government con-
trol over one—sixth of the American
economy, but there is little evidence
that Republicans fully understand the
moral argument against government
expansion and still less evidence that
they would be able to successﬁilly ap-
peal all or part of Obainacare anytime
in the next decade.

For this reason, we must un-
derstand that the way to shrink the
government and limit its ability to in-
trude into our daily lives is not simply

letter after his name. We tried this
with Obama and he’s clearly shown
that he cannot be trusted to restore
American civil liberties.

Instead, we must find new ways
to limit the size of a government that
concurrently lirriits the power of po-
litical parties, the earning potential
of career politicians and the ability of
said politicians to isolate themselves
from the public. Possible solutions
could be found in the methods ad-
opted by individualstates to slow

government only viable

Texas, for instance, has a part-
time legislature that meets for only
140 days every two years and then
holds special sessions as situations
merit it. Its costs are far lower than
those of full—time state legislatures,
and most importantly, its legislators
are not career politicians but instead
"regular people who must work in
their state like everyone else under
the laws they pass.

Indeed, I believe that legislation
produced by our federal government

solution

were comprised of ‘citizen lawmak-
ers rather than career politicians. I
doubt that many citizen lawmakers
would vote to give a government
agency the power to spy on Ameri-
cans without warrants or regulate
one-sixth of the economy if they felt
that the law might apply to them at
some point.

Yoga group bowing to donations

Yoga 4 1

before the transition I trudged
through piles of snow to talk to the
Conleys at their second—ﬂoor studio
on Ellsworth Avenue. It was 10 min-
utes afcer the last class of the day,
and I made it about three—quarters
of the way up the stairs before it hit
me: a wave of dripping—wet, sauna-
like heat.

I remembered this heat and my
ﬁrll-sized bath towel thatwas soaked
by the end of my session. Amazing
Yoga heats its studios to a tempera-
ture of at least 90 degrees to increase
blood ﬂow to muscles, which pre-
vents injuries and results in an ex-
hilaratingfull-bodyworkoutthat one
does not usually associate with yoga.
(The morning after, I painfully dis-
covered the truth behind this —— and
muscles I never knewl had.)

Mentally willing myself to not
sweat profusely, I held my fogged
glasses in one hand and greeted the
Conleys with the other. I noticed that
Karen, who had just ﬁnished teaching
back-to-back classes, was glowing
as if freshly showered. She bustled
around the studio, shutting things
down and packing things up while
Sean, snuginhiswinter coat, smiled
and suggested we pop asquat on the
ﬂoor. Iwiped my forehead and agreed

that this was a wonderful place to do
the interview, but thought, “You have
got to be kidding me.”

Luckily, Karen overrode his sug-
gestion and instead we headed to
the Crazy Mocha across the street.
Sipping San Pelligrino, Karen de-
scribed how she got interested in
yoga 17 years ago while pregnant
with her ﬁrst child. Sean picked it
up a couple years later —- partly in
an effort to soothe the hip ﬂexors and
lower back muscles that he injured
after playingfootball for Pitt and for
various teams duringafour-year stint
in the NFL. -—

Both of them studied under re-
nowned yogi Baron Baptiste and fell

in love with the accessibility of his

power vinyasa style of yoga. Faster-

paced and athletic, power vinyasa‘

emphasizes moving through poses
instead of achieving a certain posi-
tion. It is adaptable to an individual’s
strengths and weaknesses and can be
practiced by people of all shapes and
levels of ﬂexibility.

Jen Lee, manager of the South
Side studio and a lecturer of non-
ﬁcﬁon in the English department,
practiced the more traditional iyen-
garyoga for years, which focuses on
precision of posture. She said she

found the style of power vinyasa to
be more intuitive, allowing the poses
to “just feel right.”

The Conleys think that neither
body shape nor income should be a
barrier to yoga. Since opening Amaz-
ing Yoga in 2001 they have strived to
keep their rates as low as possible,
ranging from $7 to $13 per session.
They also created a work-exchange
program that allows yogis to attend
a session for an hour of cleaning up
and working the front desk.

When they ﬁrst opened, Sean said
there were probably only about three
yoga studios in Pittsburgh. Now there
are at least 15. To keep up with the
increasing popularity, they adopted
a computer system a couple years
ago to manage accounts, thinking it
would make things easier and more
efficient. “It-didn’t,” Karen said. “In
fact, it caused more angst among em-
ployees and slower-moving lines. It
also made us more corporate than
we wanted to be.”

This frustration with technology
was the ﬁrst impetus for their back-
to-the-roots donation approach, but
the clincher was the recession and
ﬁnancial concern for students and
employees. “Not aweek goes by that

FASHION COLUMN

Fashion: More than dressing the part

Samantha Stahl
Columnist

When people ask me what my major
is, I’m perfectly OKwith saying, “Writ-
ing. I Sllldy writing.” It might not be
the most lucrative program, but I’rn
proud of that identity. Do you ﬁnance
majors get to sulk around in dimly
lit coffee shops and contemplate the
meaning of existence —- for a grade?
I don’t think so.

When people ask me what I like to
write about, however, I hesitate. I’m
reluctantto respond, “Fashion,” partly
because whenever people ask, I always
seemtobedressedlikeacomplete slob.
Can’t anyone ask when I’m wearing a

cute blazerand notanoversizedt-shirt
withﬂathair?

But I’m also reluctant because
there’s acertain stereotype associated
with people who center their thoughts
on fashion —— that they’re ditzy.

Now, I’m certainly not declaring

myselfa greatintellecuial mind. On the ‘

contrary, my mental capacity is fairly

neering is a complete mystery to me.
However, I am conﬁdent enough that

band or a student losing their job,” Sean said, to
which Karen nodded and added, “Some people
have told us that they couldn’t continue if we
didn’t switch.”

Inthe letter they sent to students in Febru-
ary about the transition, they suggested $14 for
a donation in order to ease anxiety and uncer-
tainty. But they have no way of knowing how
much each person gives, since the table with the
donation box is separate from the front desk.
Sean said that he hopes this privacywill relieve
any pressure to contribute a certain amount.
“The point is that everyone can pay according
to how they value the practice,” Karen said.

In addition to per—session donations, stu-
dents who don’fwant to carry cash with them
each time also have to option to purchase mul-
tiple donation cards. Together, this income fully
supports the operating costs of the studios and
the livelihoodsof Karen, Sean and their 20 or
so employees. For this reason, they emphasized
that donations do not mean free or cheap yoga.
“If you don’t donate,” Karen said, “we can’t
operate.” '

Ironically, since the economy tanked, the
business itself has actually done ﬁne. In fact,
attendance has increased — atrend that Sean
and Karen attribute to the extra free time and
a need for stress relief that results from unem-
ployment. Still, nothing is certain in the current
ﬁnancial atmosphere.

Sean —-— who began but never completed a
master’s degree in business administration at
Pitt — admitted with a laugh that “this is prob-
ably the last thing any business expert would
advise you to do.” Yet my attempts to getthe
Conleys to show fear or anxiety 5- anything
that would signal capitalistic Americanism —
only resulted in shrugs and a shared ‘smiles.

“We have made yoga commercial in the
U.S.,”- Karen said. “This is a way to make it sim-
ple  We have no way of knowingwhat will
happen, but if this is what we’re meant to do,
the universe will take care of us. Besides,” she
added, “it’s not like we could never go bac .”

I walked home from the coffee shop re-
freshed by the Conleys’ apparent altruism, yet
still a little skeptical. I talked to my friend Ash-
ley Lynch, a senior who does Amazing Yoga’s
work-exchange program, and it made a little
more sense. I I

“Sean always says that we do the deep for-
ward fold again and again so thatwe can bend
over and tie our shoes when we’re 70 or 80,”
she said, laughing. A vegan and yoga enthusi-
ast, power vinyasa at Amazing Yoga has given
Ashley time for herselfin ahectic life ﬁlled with
classes, work and volunteering. _ ' .

“It’s a time for meditation and reﬂection,”
she said. “When you’re in a difﬁcult pose, you
learn about yourself. You learn how to per-

POINT COUNTERPOINT

Another year of Bostick ball

Randy Lieberman
Senior Staff Writer

Tino, shmino. Here’s why redshirt
junior Pat Bostick should start at
Utah on Sept. 2 for Pitt’s football
team.

That’s right, I said redshirt ju-
nior Pat Bostick. This guy has been
around a while, and while a lot of
his experience has come from his
front-row seat on the bench, he’s
witnessed the ups (13—9 victory
over No. 2—ranked West Virginia)
and downs (45-44 loss to Cincinnati
last season) at Pitt.

With Bostick, the case always
starts with experience.

He’s been at Pitt for what seems
like a decade, but what’s been a lit-
tle over four years. Bostick started
immediately, during his freshman
season in 2007. It was apparent he
wasn’t ready to start, but what quar-
terbacks other than Tim Tebow and
Brady Quinn ever are?

Yet, he still won games that mat-

’ tered.

In the infamous “13-9” game,
Bostick was just effective enough to
earn avictory, even muscling in Pitt’s
only touchdown on a quarterback
sneak from the one yard line. Then,
in 2008, he was at the helm when
Pitt upended Notre Dame in three
overtimes for a 36-33 victory.

That’s two road wins thus far,
shooter. What has your boy Tino
Sunseri given us? It’s been hardly
anything overly impressive in gar-
bage time against Youngstown State,

Navy, South Florida and Syracuse. .

Bostick has two road wins under
his belt. He’s won those games not
so much with his physical tools per
se, because frankly, he’ll be the ﬁrst
to acknowledge his biggest weak-
nesses.

“My arm strength, my foot
quickness,” Bostick said.

Bostick doesn’t throw a pretty
spiral allthe time, doesn’t release the
ball blazingly fast and doesn’t burn
defenders when he scrambles.

OK, so Sunseri has a huge advan-

tage in arm strength over Bostick. Either Tino Sunseri (No. 12) or Pat Bostick (No. 19) will take over at quarte

That’s completely understood -
not just by me, but by Bostick too.

“I don’t have an overly strong
arm, as compared to Tino. He has a
God-given strong arm, and I know
that,” Bostick said.

In that case, a quarterback needs
to have impeccable timing. For Bo-
stick, this comes naturally as he had
a chance to improve his understand-
ing of offensive coordinator Frank
Cignetti’s offense by redshirting last
season.

He also said he did alot of lifting
and strength training to improve
his arm strength and foot speed.
It’s clear the offseason work has

' paid off.

Plus, the one physical tool Bo-
stick does have is size, something
Tino, or shall I say, Tin—y doesn’t

V have. I understand, it says Sunseri

is 6-foot-2 on Pitt’s website. Trust

the article is why Sunseri should start.

First, considerthat“It’s 'I‘ino Time”
is a pretty catchy slogan that can be
tossed aroundwhenever Sunseritakes
the ﬁeld. Not convinced?

The case for Sunseri over Bostick
is an argument for upside over experi-
ence. Ifsunserisecuresthestartingrole
it gives consistency to the quarterback
position for the next three seasons. ‘ii

Yes, Bostick has a wealth of game
experience from the 2007 and 2008
seasons, which includes Pitfs colossal
upsetofnationalchampionship-bound
West Virginia and its defeat of Notre
Dame in an overtime thriller.

However, Bostick’s statistics don’t
suggestthat he carriedthe Panthersto
those victories. Aginstwest Virginia,
he onlycompleted lopassesandthrew
two interceptions. Dun'ngPitfs victory
overthe Irish, his one touchdown pass
was accompanied bythree picks. K

In total, Bostid<’s career statistics
aren’t impressive: 177 for 293, 1770
yards, nine touchdowns and 17 picks.

While Bostick has improved both
physically and mechanically, it’s clear
frompracticethatSunserihasastIon-
gerarm and throws atighterball.

Sunseri, a graduate of Pittsburgh
CentralCatholicHighSchool, isn‘tastall
asBostick, buthe’s more mobile andcan
makeplayswithhisfeetifnecessary.

Additionally, Sunseri almost stole
the startingjob awayfrom St1rllinsum—
mer camp last year. The coachingstatf
was impressed enoughwith Sunserito
place him second on the depth chart
and to redshirt Bostick.

In limited game action, Sunseri
showed glimpses of his potential, go"-'
ing 10 of 17 with two touchdowns and
no interceptions.

Skeptics might worry about the
redshirt sophomore experiencing
turbulence when faced with his ﬁrst
portion ofmeaningﬁil game action. BL§,
Sunseri has a comfortable safety blan-
ket in Heisman-hopeful Dion Lewis,

who canlimitthe pressure on Sunseri’s
shoulders.

’ The coaching staff apparently
agrees that Sunseri is the top option.“
Throughout springcamp, hehastaken
every ﬁrst-team repetition.

what to expect from Woods’ return to golf

With Tiger Woods competing./in his fL’I’S‘t tournament since November, hordes of people will be watching to see what happens.

Adam Littman
V Assistant Sports Editor

 

So, you’ve decided to start paying atten-
tion to golf. Welcome.

Now’s a great time to get into the sport,
as the Masters, one of golf’s four major
events, kicks off tomorrow. There are a
lot of great storylines surrounding the
Masters this year.

First, can Angel Cabrera defend his
green jacket after a thrilling playoff vic-
tory last year against Kenny Perry and

‘Chad Campbell? Can Perry bounce back

'" after collapsing up two strokes with two _

\_ holes to play in last year’s Masters? Perry,
who was 48 years old at the Augusta Na-
tional last year, would’ve been the oldest
person to win a major but bogeyed the
17th and 18th holes, forcing the three-way
playoff in which he ultimately lost. How
will favorite Ernie Elsplay using former
NHL player Dan Quinn as his caddy op-

ing around the Internet to ﬁgure all of that
out, if you were so inclined. Personally, do-
ing that sounds like cheating both yourself
and the sport of golf, but whatever.

No, you’re paying attention to golf
right now because of the return of Tiger
Woods. The Masters will be Woods’ first
tournament since Nov. 15 when he won the
Australian Open. Since that time, Woods

Now, arguably the greatest golfer ever

is popular tabloid fodder, a disgrace to f
the sport and traditional family values,’

depending on who you listen to. And that’s
why you’re following golf for probably the

ﬁrsttime in your life. You want to see what V

happens during Woods’ return.

Well, if you’re expecting to tune in and
see Woods having sex on the third green,
that probably won’t happen. Woods has
lost a ton of sponsors as well as the trust
of his fans (and maybe his family, but let’s
focus on what’s important here). ,

Part of his return is damage control
on his image. Having sex with someone
on the course, even if it were his wife,
would not help his cause. Well, actually,
he’d get thevoyeur demographic onhis
side, but unless he’s coming out with his
own brand of telescopes that probably
doesn’t help much.

But, perhaps you’re not tuning in to see

New York Times reported the crowd was
mostly silent, and nothing derogatory or
mean—spirited was yelled at him. Of course,
as everyone knows, the rowdy golf crowds
wait until the tournament starts to attend.
But if Monday is any indication, it doesn’t
look like any ladies will be showering the
course with their undergarments. After all,
this is the Masters, not a Seal concert.
Or maybe you want to see what Woods is
wearing on his wrist. During an interview
afew weeks back on the Golf Channel,
Woods caused a bit of a stir by wearing

So far, the crowds at the Masters have remained calm‘ while watching Tiger Woods.

back on his side, he’lltee off wearing a

, purity ring tomorrow.

Perchance you’ll watch just to make
jokes using words like “stroke,” “hole” or
“wood.” Or you could josh around about
popular sex act, the “ Happy Gilmore.”
Don’t forget to hilariously refer to the man
of honor as “Cheetah Woods,” though.
That one will never get stale.

So no matter why you’re going to watch
golf this weekend, it’s great to have you
aboard. ' . .

Hopefully this helped quell any outra-
geous expectations you had for what you
-might see while watching the Masters. It’s
just being really hyped up, and someone
had to set everything straight.

Oh, and one more quick thing to keep in
mind: In golf, the lowest score wins.

Bostick has

Bostick 4 13

A the ball just far enough for Cross to grab it on

the way to the score.

There’s that offseason arm strength work
paying off. ’

Sure, you can say he’s going against a sec-
ond—tier defense. I say, however, that Bostick

is only throwing to second—tier talent. That

makes his stellar play throughout the scrim-

, mage even‘ more impressive; I would love to

see what he could do withja safety blanket in
wide receiverjonathan Baldwin.
Sunseri is getting all of the ﬁrst-team reps,

. yet Pitt coaches insist there’s,an open compe-

tition at quarterback. Bostick must be doing
something right to warranta competition.

" Whether he starts the.f1rst»game,.,or.not,i,

Bostick will at some poinifbve thrown into ac-
tion this season. Sunseri will be ineffective as
a ﬁrst—year starter — or, _God forbid, have to
sit outwith an injury. ' g

In that case, Bostick will be more than up
to the task of playing in his place;

’ Oh, anddid I also mention there is someone I

out therewho has devoted an entire website
to him‘? . A

Yeah, he’s going to be a starting quarter-
back 4- and have his own site to‘ boot.

Sunseri ahead at training camp

Sunseri < 13

During the Panthers’ ﬁrst full-contact scrim-
mage this past Saturday, Sunseri accounted for
ﬁve touchdowns. He completed 13 of 18 passes,
for 129yards and fourtouchdowns, while running
foranaddilional score. ' 1

Ifyoudon’tlike statistics, here are some more
trivial points: Tino’s father Sal Sunseriwas anAll-
American linebacker at Pin and his mother, Rox-
ann, was a standout gymnast for the Panthers.

Forfanswho enjoy parallels, Sunseri attended
Pittsburgh Cenlral Catholic, as did Hall of Fame
quarterback and Pitt legend Dan Marino.

The decidingfactorwillbewins andlosses on
the ﬁeld. Sunseri is well aware that regardless of
who starts, thefate of theteamcomes ﬁrst.

“Each of us wants to win football games,”

Sunseri said Saturday. “That’s the only thingthat ' .

matters to the University of Pittsburgh: winning
football games andbringingachampionship back
to Pitt. Whoever is under center, that’s what we
wantto do.” .

Right now, Tino Sunseri presents the best op-
tion to win games in the fall, and that is priority
number one. »
