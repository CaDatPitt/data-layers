RAs clash wiII1 ORI.

RA quits over conflict

By Mark Giordon

Asst. News Editor

Michael Henderson began
the school year living by
himself in a double bedroom
in Tower B.

Earlier this month, he
moved into an apartment in
Squirrel Hill.

The move was not some-
thing he planned on, it only
became necessary when
Henderson quit his job as a
resident assistant, partly
because he felt he was not
being appropriately backed
up by the Office of
Residence Life.

Henderson was having
some problems with a resi-
dent on his ﬂoor in Tower B.
He said he “wrote up” the
resident over 10 times and no
action was taken against him.

“I was getting no back up
and no support from the

Office of Residence Life,”

Henderson said.

Henderson said the prob-
lems with the resident began

in the middle of October."

From then until around
Thanksgiving, Henderson
said he filed 10 CRs (conduct
reports) with ORL. No action
was taken against the resi-
dent. and according to
Henderson, “the last incident
was a blowup between the
both of us.”

According to Henderson,
around 3 a.m. one morning,
he asked the resident to turn
his radio down. The resident
refused, and a screaming
fight ensued between the
two.

In an interview with The
Pitt News, Henderson said
during the argument the resi-
dent walked “down the hall
and he says, ‘I’m going beat
your ass, you nigger.”’

After several phone calls,
the resident could not be
reached for comment last

RAs fired for parties

By John B. Moore
Asst. News Editor ‘

Thirteen resident assistants

i were fired and asked to move

out of their rooms last week
as a result of two parties dur-
ing finals week.

According .to former RA
Deena Buchanan, five or six
other RAs were in her Tower
B room on Saturday, Dec. 17.
On the same night, nine
floors below, another party
was being held.

Another RA notified the
resident director about the
noise and alcohol was found
in both rooms.

i “There was a little bit of
drinking, but it was not out
of control,” said Buchanan.
She also stressed that if more
residents had been in the
building they wouldn’t have
been drinking.

“To my knowledge, there
weren’t any [residents] on
the floors above or below,”

The new Student
Government Board is off
and running to a rapid
start. Whether it be for-
mulating plans for the
new Undergraduate
Business School or
reforming the Sexual
Assault Task Force, this
year’s SGB members are

pied.

Last Monday, members
of the Board and the
Freshman Council took
part in the Martin Luther

During this celebration,
various events were
scheduled throughout the
week, totaling 20 events
in 10 days. It was orga-

such generous acts in the
future.

“It was a nice thing to
do, and we hope to do
more,” she said.

The SGB also plans on
lobbying for changes in
the current Block meal
plan that has some Pitt
students up in arms due to
left over blocks at the end

of the semester. However,
the current food service
system is under a con-
tract. As a result,
President Crowell said
that changes cannot be
made until next year, but
firmly stated that there
will be changes coming
next year.

said Buchanan, who had
been. on duty all weekend.

Former Holland Hall RA
Susan Cespuglio, who
attended the party on the
eighth floor. said “there were
people drinking, but nothing
was out of hand.”

On Wednesday, Dec. 21,
after the RAs had left for the
holiday break, Buchanan was
called in by the Office of
Residence Life to tell her
side of the story. _

“They interrogated me for
an hour and a half,” said
Buchanan. “It was pretty
stressful, it was kind of like
the McCarthy trials.”

According to Buchanan,
when the RAs returned from
the break, they were still
scheduled to work. “They
had us signed up for week-
ends, pretty much just pro-
ceeding as before.”

JAPAN — In one of Japan’s
worst earthquakes in 50 years,
the death toll rose to almost
2,900.

By Wednesday, 400,000 homes
were still without electricity or
water and ﬁreﬁghters, some 36
hours later, were still trying to
extinguish ﬁres.

The death toll is estimated to
be at 2,872 with 870 people miss-
ing. Some 14,572 people were
reported injured, with most of the
fatalities and half of the injuries
coming from the city of Kobe.

Many of the disaster victims
are afraid to return to their homes
because aftershocks may cause
their homes to collapse.

Since the quake on Tuesday,
over 700 aftershocks could be
felt in the city, and the govem—
ment warned that a significant
aftershock may hit the area in a
month. — Reuters

LOS ANGELES — The body
of Voni Lynn Wong, a 24-year-
old American English teacher,
was found among the rubble in
the city of Ashiya in Japan.

The home that Wong, a resi-

collapsed.

She was among the estimated
2,900 people killed in the earth-
quake that hit Japan on Tuesday.

MOSCOW — Ceaseﬁre hopes
in Chechnya were dashed
Wednesday as Russian President
Boris Yeltsin refused to have
direct peace talks with Dzhokhar
Dudayev, the Chechen rebel
leader.

Yeltsin cited the reason for
refusing peace talks was that
Dudayev had attempted to com-
mit genocide on his people.

Dudayev’s officials said they
had agreed to peace talks with
Russian leaders but were told
they had to stop fighting first
without being assured that
Russian troops would cease ﬁr-

Russian ofﬁcials are reported to
be skeptical of Dudayev’s claims
that he speaks for his people and

Children
taught
about
weight
loss

By Kathleen Scanlon
Senior Staff Writer

By focusing on school and
making friends, children who
are obese can gain self-esteem,
which can help them to lose
weight.

“[In] modern society in gen-
eral, people focus so much on
what you look like and how
much you weigh, we like to
have kids concentrate on other
things,” said Dr. Lucene
Wisniewski, program director
of the Childhood Healthy
Eating Program, or CHEP.

CHEP, now accepting refer-
rals, developed from a UPMC
program called STOPLIGHT,
which helped overweight chil-
dren to lose weight by dividing
foods into categories like red
light foods and green light
foods, making it easier to rec-
ognize healthy choices.

CHEP began in March and
was designed to help morbidly
obese children, those who
weigh more than twice their
ideal weight, and children who
suffer psychologically because
of their weight, Wisniewski
said.

“There are some kids for

whom eating becomes a way to

cope with their problems,”
Wisniewski said. “Maybe if
they have a really bad day they
come home and comfort them-
selves in that way.”

Many obese children suffer
from depression or anxiety.

' They also may be prone to
physical disorders like sleep A

apnea, when the airwaves
become obstructed when sleep-
ing.

Crime increases over holiday weekend

By Mark Gordon
Asst News E it r

 

Last weekend, many Pitt
students took advantage of
the three-day holiday and
the spring weather, as
proven by the excess of
dogs and frisbees in
Schenley Park.

However, the break was
anything but relaxing
for Pitt police, as
some criminals around
campus did not take a
vacation.

The crime wave began
early, on Thursday around
noon behind Trees Hall.
According to police there
was a “gun fight” in
the housing developments
located near Robinson
Court.

“It was a running gun
battle that moved behind
Trees Hall,” said Rick

Boyd, director of Public
Safety.

6 Boyd said that a group
of males was chasing
one person and shots
were fired.

No individuals were
injured, and no one has
been caught by either
Public Safety or the
housing police.

The crimes continued
early Friday morning
behind Old Engineering
Hall. Two males
approached a male stu-
dent and demanded his
wallet. One of the suspects
lifted his shirt and
revealed a gun to the
victim. The suspects took
the individual’s wallet and
fled.

As the morning passed
and Friday the 13th came
alive, Pitt was dealt its
most serious crime of the

weekend.

Around 11 p.m., David
Orsborn, a junior, was
assaulted on the steps of
the Towers. He was
repeatedly kicked in the
head as other students
walked by, going in and
out of the Towers. Last
night Orsborn was in
serious condition at
Presbyterian University
Hospital.

Today, Orsborn will be
undergoing surgery on his
face, and according to his
sister, Samantha, he has
come down with pneumo-
nia.

The busy weekend con-
tinued for Public Safety
the next day.

Saturday night, around
9:30 p.m., Public Safety
officers made two arrests
within two minutes of
each other.

One was for disorderly
conduct and resisting
arrest, and in a separate
incident, an individual was
chargedwith drug posses-
sion.

Earlier in the day, there
were two other arrests
made. A Pitt student was
arrested in Tower A
for possession of
drugs, and an individual

was arrested and charged

with driving under
the influence on Forbes
Avenue.

Also on Saturday, offi-
cers responded to a rob-
bery at the 7-1] on Forbes
Avenue. The suspect took
a bag of potato chips and
fled the store.

The suspect was caught
by Pittsburgh City Police

officers, frisked and was ‘

found to be carrying a
stolen hand gun.

“The Student Government
will have a hand in the
changes that will be made
next year,” she said.

However, according to
Crowell, statistics show that
the majority of people who
use the current Block plan
use it effectively.

“Ninety percent of the
students that use the Block
Plan use it effectively, and
they have computer print-
outs to prove that.

If the meal plan does
change drastically, it’s
going to hurt the 90 percent
that used it effectively,” she
stated.

Crowell added that the
current system is a compli-
cated system and that the
problems that have arisen
are nobody’s fault.

SGB is also in the process

of educating more student

groups on the topic of sexu-
al assault.

Board member John
Capriotti said that the board
members plan on orga-
nizing smaller student
groups and bringing them
all together to educate
them on the subject of sex-
ual assault. Currently, a

group is not given
information on sexual
assault, but has‘ to

request it. Capriotti wants
to provide this information
to as many groups as possi-
ble.

“What I want to do is
organize as many as groups
as possible into requesting
these services to get the
information, because right
now it’s not a mandatory
thing,” he said.

Capriotti also mentioned
a possible escort service
to places which the
current Pitt shuttles don’t
pass by. However, this idea
has not yet been formalized
and is still in the works.

Fired

°From page 1
Tuesday, Jan. 10. Most of the
RAs fired were residents of
Tower B.

“We had no way to know
whether we should look for
an apartment,” said
Buchanan. “They didn’t
show any regard for anything
we’ve given to ORL.”

Cespuglio said, although
the ORL was in a tough spot
in terms of deciding a pun-
ishment, she didn’t deserve
to be fired.

According to the Director
of Residence Life Jo Ann
Woodson, letters went out to
the RAs via the resident
directors on Jan. 10. “ A t
that date they were relieved
of their responsibilities,” said
Woodson. Jan. 17 was listed
as the day they needed to
find a new place to reside.

Woodson said those fired
were the ones consuming
alcohol while they were still
on duty.

The process of deciding

what punishment would be
handed down was painful,
said Woodson, “and all
options were considered
ranging from no action to the
other end —— termination.”

“It was a slow and meticu-
lous process and we tried to
utilize the collective input of
the group,” Woodson said.

Buchanan and Cespuglio
both said they are worried
about how the residents’
problems will be handled by
under-trained RAs.

“I know so many residents
who are suffering because
they don’t have RAs,” said
Cespuglio.

While serving as a resident
assistant, Buchanan said she
had to deal with problems
ranging from domestic vio-
lence and alcoholism to rape.
“I’ve always been there for
them, and they haven’t taken
that into consideration.”

Commenting on the possi-
bility of being understaffed,
Woodson said, “This is just

one of the unfortunate
aspects of change.”

Woodson said the training
for new RAs would be a
combination of working with
current resident assistants,
working with the ORL staff
and training classes.

According to the Vice
Chancellor for Public Affairs
Leon Haley, “We take the
position that our RAs are
role models for our students.
The [drinking of] alcohol on
duty is totally inappropriate.”

For birthday parties, “we
would recommend that a child
have something to eat before
they go so they’re not very hun-
gry and plan ahead of time to
have one dessert, instead of
going and having whatever they
want.” '

-Counselors teach children
how to say “no, thank you”
when grandparents or other rel-
atives urge them to keep eating.
Children can explain that
they’re trying to watch their
weight and ask for help and
support from their relatives.

Counselors also teach parents
about reading nutrition labels,
making good food choices and
how to set limits with their chil-
dren, Wisniewski said.

Children as young as three
years old have come to CHEP
with their parents. The problem
may be “that the parents are

tions for the kid,” Wisniewski
said. Or that “the parents are

Conﬂict

-From page 1
night.

Henderson said he report-
ed that incident to ORL, and
he was told that both he and
the resident would be talked
to and possible disciplinary
action would be taken
against both of them.

Henderson told The Pitt
News he thought that was
unfair, and he quit atthe end
of the winter term.

Jo Ann Woodson, the
director of the ORL, said in
regard to the Henderson situ-
ation that “an incident defi-
nitely occurred.”

“The whole issue seems to
be unclear in terms of what
happened,” Woodsonsaid.

Henderson was not the
only RA to reportedly have
problems with ORL.
According to Dennis
Donham, vice chancellor for
student affairs, 66 RAs
signed a letter addressed to
him about complaints they
had with ORL.

“The petition focused on

communication issues,”
Donham said. ,“The concern
is that they have a very
demanding job and commu-
nication is important.”
A The Pitt News could not
obtain a copy of the letter
because, according to
Donham, the RAs who wrote
it did not want it to be
released.

“RAs realize that we have
certain needs and issues that
need to be addressed by the
Office of Residence Life,”
said a second-year RA, who
wished not to be identified.

Donham said the RA did
not want the letter to be
released to the public
because the RA was “con-
cerned that it was an internal
matter.”

Donham said he passed the
complaints on to Woodson

and he has received positive .

reaction so far.
One of the RAs who was

3 fired last week for participat-

ing in a party in Tower B,
Susan Cespuglio,
Woodson in particular was
not that helpful with the
RAs. ‘

“I’ve never really dealt
with Jo Ann, but she never
really made an effort to
know the RAs,” said
Cespuglio.

Woodson could not be
reached for response on
Cespug1io’s comments last
night. '

Coffee

°From page 1

“I thought, ‘Screw it. It’s not
such a bad thing,”’ she said as
she sipped from her cafe
mocha at the Beehive.

But some dieticians and
nutritionists say coffee can be
a bad thing. Drinking coffee in
moderation, having about two
or three cups a day, will not
wreak havoc on your health,
but consistently going over-
board, drinking six or seven
cups a day, might.

Some students go overboard
with coffee consumption when
they cram for exams and
papers or when they try to
diet. But caffeine’s power to
help students in these situa-
tions is overrated, say dieti-
cians and nutritionists.

After caffeine leaves the
body’s system, a more intense
fatigue can settle in, said Patty
Verdi, a registered dietician for
Pitt’s Student Health Services.

“In the end they really end

doesn’t really enhance their
ability to perform well,” said
Shirley Haberman, director of
Pitt’s Health Education Office.

Also, coffee has a “very
short-lived effect,” according
to Leslie Bonci, the outpatient
coordinator at the University
of Pittsburgh Medical Center
Nutrition Services.

Bonci said drinking a cup of
coffee will only do good for
half an hour. If a student needs
to stay awake for a 4’p.m.
class, it is best to drink a cup
of coffee at 3:30 p.m. instead
of earlier in the afternoon.

Coffee also does not neces-
sarily help people to shed
pounds.

“A lot of students misper-
ceive the benefits of caffeine
and believe it’s effective as a
weight loss agent. It’s not,”
said Haberman.

According to Bonci, coffee
can lower a person’s blood
sugar which in turn increases a
person’s appetite. If a person

T rollercoaster of

weight loss? This time,

drinks only coffee for break-
fast and eats no food, he/she
will become even hungrier
than usual when the coffee
leaves his/her system and may
eat more to compensate.

Drinking too much coffee
also piles on the calories. A
student who flrinks 10 to 12
cups of cofzf-..:e a day may be
consuming cream and sugar
with every cup, said Verdi.

Other effects may chip away
at a student’s ability to con-
centrate. Since caffeine is a
stimulant, it can increase the
heart beat and breathing rate
as well as make a person more
jittery and sometimes anxious,
said Bonci.

Fischer said her reaction to
caffeine varies according to
what she eats from day to day.
Some days her tolerance to
caffeine protects her from its
effects. But “some days I drink
it and I’m bouncing off the
walls.”

Some people cannot even

drink coffee because it makes
them so jumpy and agitated,
said Bonci.

And when addicts try to
stop, these symptoms are
sometimes mirrored. “The
body goes through some mild
withdrawal symptoms,” said
Bonci.

Those symptoms can include
headaches, irritability, ner-
vousness, fatigue and anxiety.
However, these symptoms
may not linger for very long.

It takes about two or three
days for the body to get back
“to adjusting on its regular
pace,” said Verdi.

As for long-term effects of
coffee intake, Bonci said stud-
ies have not revealed any seri-
ous consequences.

She said there is the possi-
bility of depleting your body
of minerals and vitamins. This
might occur in a person who
doesn’t maintain a well-bal-
anced diet but sticks to a well-
rehearsed coffee habit.

Move SGB meeiings

The Student Government Board has been meeting and
retreating to set up its strategy for the upcoming year.
During. the election season. The Pitt News met with all of the
candidates to discover their views on the various issues.

One idea which came out of these meeting was to move
the meetings out of the Student Government Board Office in
639 William Pitt Union to a higher-profile location, such as
one of the Union Dining Rooms or the Kurtzman Room in
the William Pitt Union. _

The reasoning behind this was to help combat student apa-
thy. The board needs to be in constant contact with the stu-
dents in order to be responsive to their needs. In addition,
the students need to be aware of the board so that they can
make themselves heard. The interaction does not end after
the election. p

In last Tuesday’s Pitt News, the SGB announced that it
would be holding its meetings for this term in 639 William
Pitt Union. :

Before it adopts this meeting time as permanent, the board
ought to look into holding the meetings elsewhere, as many
of the board members suggested in their candidacy. Students
should turn out at the next meeting to let them know that
they would like to see a room change: One final suggestion,
although students should seek out these kind of events —
the meetings should be publicized before theyoccur.

good clause

The first bill of the l04th ‘Congress passed today, ending
the Congressmen’s exemptions from discrimination and
workplace laws. According to The New York Times, the laws
which will be extended. to the Congress include the 1964
Civil Rights Act, the American with Disabilities Act, the
Occupational Safety Act and the Family and Medical Leave
Act. The Congress must also now pay its employees at least
minimum wage and time and a half for any hours beyond a
40-hour work week. The measure ha_s already passed the
Senate. '

This bill will most likely be the only one with such easy
passage. It is also probably the most desirable and least
controversial”part of the Republican “Contract with
America,” which all of America is not so sure it wants to see
honored.

Still, it is a positive step to force the Congress to operate
under the same guidelines as the rest of America. While the
Congress once contended that this would violate separation
of powers because the executive branch could enforce laws
over the legislature, Congress is not an aristocracy and since
government is a large/employer, it should be accountable to
its employees. This is the one laudable clause in a contract
which America might be better off to breach.

Proportional represen ioiion a good idea  

hose of you who follow
I the political scene will
remember the political
scandal involving Lani
‘ Guinier about two years ago.
For those of you who do not,
Lani Guinier was nominated
by ‘President Clinton, very
early in his term, to be the
assistant attorney general for
civil rights. However,
, Republicans got wind of her
“radical” views on voting and
voting rights and labeled her
‘the “Quota Queen.” Rather
than fight it out, Clinton
bowed to political pressure
and backed off the nomina-
tion.

The issue of voting and vot-
ing rights is a tremendously
important one right now, and
there are a number of cases to
be decided by the Supreme
Court this year on that issue.
Not that long ago I read Lani
Guinier’s proposed solution to
theproblem and found it to be
anything but radical. Itmay
not be the correct solution, but
it is something that should be
discussed freely, rather than
be a taboo subject which can
ruin people’s political futures.

The problem many people
have with our current system
of voting involves the ques-
tion of whether our elected
politicians really represent the
populace, or merely one domi-
nant subsection of the popu-
lace. The United States, for
the most part, has a voting
system called single-member
districts. This means that
when people vote in an elec-
tion, say for the House of
Representatives, they vote in a
particular district which only
elects one person. For exam-
ple, those of us in Oakland
live in the 18th Congressional
District and elected Mike
Doyle as our representative in
Congress. However, there are
20 Representatives in the
House representing
Pennsylvania whom we have
no control over the election
of. What this effectively
results inis a two-party sys-

tem, with a fairly narrow
viewpoint, dominated by
white males. 4,

To clarify this problem, let’s
say that in an imaginary dis-
trict 10 percent of the people
would ideally like to be repre-
sented by a candidate who is
primarily concerned with the

environment, another 10 per- ‘

— cent would like a socialist and
another 10 percent would like
a black representative.
However the dominant two
parties, the Democrats and the
Republicans, have no one who
fits these qualifications. The
Democrats and Republicans
run against each other and put
forth the candidate who has
the best chance to win. This is
never a pure environmentalist

or socialist and rarely is a 9

black (or other minorities) or a
woman elected in this country.

The white male representing-

mainstream views is the most
likely to win office, which is
why our nation’s political sys-
tem is primarily made up of
them. .

Therefore, in a two-way
race, a politician may receive
60 percent of the votes; how-
ever he may only be the ideal
candidate of 25 percent of the
people. Is this candidate really
representing the entire "con-
stituency, or is he merely rep-
resenting 25 percent of it?
This is a question to which
there is no objective answer; it
depends on what your concept

,of representation is. However
many people View this as a
problem due to the disenfran-
chisement of many minority
groups, whether those groups
be blacks, Hispanics, women,
environmentalists, socialists
or any other group whose
views are not proportionately
represented; i.e. there is notllan
equivalent percentage of rep-
resentatives to match the actu-
al percentage of minority fig-
ures, such as a congressional
body which is 5 percent black
representing an area which is
20 percent black.

One way in which this prob-

lem has been attacked, at least
in regards to blacks, has been
the creation of “safe” districts.
The politicians would gerry-
mander a state’s districts,
resulting in the creation of a
certain number of districts
which have blackmajorities
so that a black can be elected.

These are known as majority- :

minority districts. Of course

this means that in the other -

districts, there are almost no
blacks- Many people are
unsatisfied with this method,
citing it as racist, unconstitu-
tional and unfair. Also, it only
addresses one minority view,
that of blacks.

Lani Guinier, a black
woman, was disgusted by this
method" and proposed doing
away with single-member dis-
tricts and making elections for
congressional bodies like the
House of Representatives at
large races. Say we had a state
with 10 Representatives. In
this race everyone would get
10 votes and be allowed to
distribute their votes however
they wanted: 10 for one per-
son; 7 for one and three for
another; 2 to five; etc., etc.

With this form of propor-
tional representation there
would be representationof the
populace. The dominant group
would still get the majority or
plurality of the representa-
tives, but those 10 percent
who wanted an environmen-
talist, or a socialist or a black,
could vote that person in, and
the representative body would
more closely represent the at-
large population.

This solution is hardly radi-
cal, and some form of propor-
tional representation is in
place in many European coun-
tries. It is not a panacea, and

, there are problems with it -
such as building effective _

coalitions —- but it is not radi-
cal, nor quota-based, and
should be considered by the
American populace.

sands of miles away on an
island nation. A

January 19 1995

 

Do you remember those
long summer nights stuck in
suburbia? It was midnight,
and you were at home
because there wasn’t a single
bartender stupid enough to
believe you were 21 with a
penciled on mustache. So you
and your friend were forced to
have some non-alcoholic fun,

_like mailbox baseball or

egging the principal’s house.
Unfortunately, those junior
licenses ran out at 11, so
home you went. You still
weren’t tired, and the only
thing to do was cruise those
13 stations. You flipped over
and over looking for anything
to watch that wasn’t produced
by National Geographic or
about fishing. Then there it
was, sandwiched between
Charlie’s Angels and re-cast
of Bowling for Dollars, the Bad
Sci-Fi movie. Whether it was
the Grail at the end of your
quest or just something to do,
it was a hell of a lot better
than going to sleep early so
you could get up to mow your
lawn.

They’re going to try and
recreate those heady days of
late-night discovery this
Saturday at the Beehive. You
may miss the loving glow of
the cathode ray tube and
Ronco Pocket fisherman ads.
So what, this big screen serv-

ing of five movies is a verita--

ble smorgasbord for the bad
sci-fi gourmet. You’re even
allowed to bring blankets and
pillows. So if you nap during
the boring bits, you can make
drool puddles on them instead
of the guy next to you. If you
don’t want to sleep, there’s All
Night Espresso so you can
hop yourself up on enough
caffeine to vibrate until next

Tuesday. The event Attack

From Planet Beehive should
have every closet Trekker and

Ed Wood worshipper crawling .

out for 10 action-packed hours
of the best “science gone
wrong, terribly wrong” films
even

--THEM! is the grandaddy of
“science gone wrong” movies.
It's a strange relic from the
‘50s, a time when everyone

was stupider and had great

posture. When the Army inno-
cently explodes a few A-
Bombs in the desert, an ant
hill is accidently exposed.
Now instead of dying from
cancer 20 years later like the
average American military
man did, they grow to be 20-

  

to 30-feet long. Remember, it
was the ‘50s, and back then
“Radiation Was Good For
You.” They were expecting
our generation to use it to
power everything from our
personal rocket ships to cof-
fee makers.

In the film the army doesn’t
actually find out about these
ants until they start attacking
trucks full of sugar; I think the
original ending probably had
them all die of diabetes. They
eventually use “nature’s
friend” DDT, the insecticide
almost as dangerous to
insects as it is to humans, but
the best part of THEM! is
when the ants actually attack.
The soldiers, looking really
mad, fire their machine guns
at giant rubber ant heads on
strings. One actor screams
and flails around while trying
desperately not to break the
paper maché pincers that are
supposed to be crushing him.

about how the alien’s really
nice and how we should all be

annoyingly cute kid named
“Jimmy”. You should wake up
for the end though. GORT

of you who don’t get the in-
joke, you can finally find out

--Somehow Blade Runner
worked its way into the lineup.
lt’s not ‘50s sci-fi, and it’s not
actually bad. Although the
original won director Ridley
Scott (Aliens, Dark Star) a lot
of praise for its for super-hip
story and cinematography, we
get to see the new and
improved director’s cut from
‘92. lt’s a stylish-dark homage
to ‘40s detective films filled
with moral ambiguity and dis-
guised as sci-fi. Sounds deep,
huh? Well don’t worry, there’s
plenty of gratuitous nudity and
violence in it. Harrison Ford,
as the “rep|icant” hunter, gets
a really big gun which he uses

-- The Day the Earth Stood’
Still answers the big question:
“what should humanity do if
an alien comes to earth with
the cure to cancer and other
useful stuff?” Hunt him down
like a dog and shoot him. It
again proves that people were
stupider in the ‘50s and when
talking about posture, you got
to see GORT. GORT has the
best posture of the ‘50s even
if he is a giant killer robot. You
can pretty well sleep during

  

'-g/

to blow away his various co-
stars. Daryll Hannah, in the
role of a “pleasure unit,” does
gymnastics in a body stock-
ing. Also, Rutger Hauer does
a great eye-gouging in a
scene sure to raise your
lunch.

Blade Runner may be art, it
may not, but the best parts
are the details. The scene
where Ford's blood mingles
with his ouzo is too hip for any

   
 

0 er move. Th floating zep-
pelin with the Geisha you'll
remember for the rest .of your
life. Also, pay attention to
sound of Ford’s finger popping
out of its sockets — incredibly
realistic. You can actually
make a game out of it. One
Blade Runner game could be
count the midgets — you
have to find all eight.
However, the best part of
director’s cut is the restored
night club scene. If you can,
catch the line: “Watch her take
pleasure from the snake!” The
movie is a lot better with it.
Actually, speaking of lizards,
included in the line up is:

--The Terror of
MechaGodzilla. You want to
be awake for this one. lt’s the
Big G, self-proclaimed King of
Monsters, Godzilla, in a tag
team matchup against both
his mechanical double,
MechaGodzilla, and
Titanosaurus, who looks-a lot
like a red Godzilla with a chi-
huahua head. You see once
again aliens have decided to
invade earth, and, of course,
they’ve chosen to start with
Japan, in a blatant attempt to
bring the rest ofthe world to
its knees for want of cheap
consumer electronics. And
what weapon would you use if
you were an alien? Why a
mechanical giant lizard and a
remote-controlled real one of
course. This is the movie that
proves exactly how weird our
brothers in capitalism across
the Pacific can be.

Not only does The Terror of
MechaGodzi/la offer the typi-
cal gratuitous Tokyo-smash-

 

 gal-ma anexaa snoamn

 

ing you can expect rom a
Godzilla movie, it also fea-
tures aliens that look like
green apes. Apparently ToHo
studios, the creators and own-
ers of the Godzilla franchise,
ran out of silver space span-
dex and had to use ape
masks instead for the aliens
heads. If you ever wondered
what kind of mind came up
with The Mighty Morphin
Power Rangers, watch this.
lt’s been 20 years since this
movie was released, and The
Power Rangers are its bastard
spawn. Trust me, giant bat-
tling monsters are a ton better
without, than with, teenagers
in skin-tight spandex. Oh
yeah, Godzilla wins in the end

r of course.

--The last film on the list
is The Brain From Planet
Arose. Now here is a movie
that wouldn’t be shown in the
age of Political Correctness. It
is terribly insensitive to the
plight of giant disembodied
floating brains. It portrays
them as stereotypes. You
know those giant floating
brains, always hiding inside
other people, aliens simply
concerned with conquering
earth. Does anyone ever con-
sider the disadvantages of ‘
being a giant floating brain? It
is the ultimate physical handi-
cap after all. There is a token
good giant floating brain that
hides inside a dog in the
attempt to stop the evil giant
floating brain from taking over
Earth. However, it does little

Hoop Dreams
Filmed by Steve James, Frederick
Marx and Peter Gilbert

The iconic roles William Gates and
Arthur Agee play in Hoop Dreams,
individual underdogs in an u|tra-com-
petitive system, are easily identifiable
in pop-culture, and audiences always
root for them because, after all, they
symbolize our own struggles. But what
makes this film a compelling piece of
journalism and social research is that
the filmmakers picked a timely, if not
well-worn, topic for documentary and
used it, to some latent degree, to plot a
more ideological writing of a system
which offers great rewards to many but
delivers fulfilled promises to few. This
is the story of two inner—city, African-
American youths trying to make it to
the NBA.

 

modest short about street basketball in

 Chicago’s inner-city playgrounds. After
 meeting Agee and Gates, however,
A the filmmakers altered the movie’s

cope and, working with Kartemquin
Films (a Chicago-based documentary
company which produced Golub and
Home for Life), the film ambitiously
grew into an epic endeavor.

The documentary introduces Gates
and Agee to us before they reach their
freshmen year of high school. In the
eighth grade the budding talents
attend St. Joseph’s basketball camp,
the high school from which ex—Detroit
Piston superstar Isiah Thomas gradu-
ated, and are signed to scholarships to
play for the school. When they meet
Coach Gene Pingatore, the" talk is of
their talent and their desire to reach
the NBA. For the next four years,
Gates, Agee and their families and
friends are shadowed by the filmmak-
ers, and the narrative progresses until
they complete their senior year, with

' one at a different high school all

together. .

Watching the boys, so imbued with
the NBA dream, receive laudatory
praise from the press, peers, family
and coaches, it is hard to not identify
them as something more iconographic
than basketball players — which is
where Hoop Dreams really succeeds
as a film. it’s not an expose of corrup-
tion, per se; rather the points come
across more subtlely than in a realist
documentary as it touches upon
perennial problematics with the good

sona persists throughout the docu-

“You’re a black male. The only reason
you are here is to make your team win.
If the team wins, the school makes a
lot of money. This whole thing revolves
around money.” Vitale and Pingatore’s
Isiah Alger stories are aberrant, yet
well-known, myths that are used to
exploit inner-city hopes that Gates and
Agee will have their own line of tennis
shoes. it’s not Agee’s choice to leave
the white prep school. Instead, it’s St.
Joe’s that has the money and the
power to kick the once coddled Agee
out of their school when he doesn’t
perform to their expectations.

Ideology aside, much of the pleasure
in Hoop Dreams comes from watching
the boys’ lives play out on and off the
court. Much of the movie centers on
Arthur and William interacting in social
and familial situations. From Agee

Since there are numerous
lists of«“The top 10 movies of
‘94” and so forth, I have con-
structed my own short (and
incomplete) list of movies
which I saw and remembered
seeing this year. (The really,
really bad. ones I just tend to
forget.) Whether or not the
movie was media-hyped, fabu-
lous or downright boring, it
may be found on my list.

Ki/ling Zoe — Although this
film did not get as much
advertising time or press
recognition as his video store
counterpart Quentin
Tarentino’s Pulp Fiction,
Roger Avary’s Killing Zoe sur-
passes many films of the year.
The predominantly French
cast and subtitles are, of
course, nothing new to film
watchers. His representation,
however, of a French “under-
world” is portrayed through
images which usually only can
be experienced through emo-
tions.

Even Cowgirls Get The Blues
— Fans of Tom Robbins may
be quite disappointed with
Gus Van Sant’s film which
tries to create a picture of
something that only the mind
can imagine. The inexperi-
enced Rain Phoenix (River
Phoenix’s sister) plays the
large, and incredibly pivotal,
role of Jellybean Bonanza.
Rain, at times, portrays the
wittiness of Jellybean, but
never embodies the serious-
ness of the character, of being
a true cowgirl. The film is out
on video and is worth seeing,
just to see John Hurt as the
Countessand Uma Thurman

True Lies — With all of the
sensitive reviews about this
film, my ideas of it being sim-
ply a super-action film are
skewed. Indeed, the film does
celebrate American national-
ism, and there are certain
stereotypes constructed about
Third World countries and ter-
rorists. But, doesn’t the film
contain Mr. America himself?
Arnold is the embodiment of
many Americans’ fascination
with super-high tech/super-
action films, and in this
respect, he gives to the audi-
ence the energy and fascina-
tion which they demand.

No Escape — Ray Liotta is
sent away to “prison” on an
island which is inescapable.
There are really no women
starring in the movie, which
has caused some to gripe
about the homosexual under-
tones (you know who you are).
I cannot help but envision the
star of the fantastic Evil Dead
trilogy, Bruce Campbell,
replacing Liotta. No Escape
attempts to be serious, but the
movie cannot “escape” that
“Dead by Dawn” quality. Face
it, after Goodfel/as, Ray went
downhill. Those who refuse to
believe it, just take a look at
one of his recent co-stars. l’ll
give a one word hint:
Whoopie.

Honorary Mention On Video:

True Romance-Director’s Cut

know that it is absolutely
incredible. The ‘94 director’s
cut is not drastically different,
but is definitely more violent.

takes a few more mean hits in
the hotel scene, but she also

vigourously. The thug not only

gets shot, but takes a severe
beating with the gun as well.
Juicier, and better.

Dangerous Games — Abel
Ferrara delivers a fascinating
story about a director attempt-
ing to make his movie withtwo
performers who do not particu-
larly get along. Dangerous
Games stars Harvey Keitel as
the struggling director, and
Madonna (don't let this stop
you from renting it) and James
Russo (who is incredible) as
the squabbling characters.
Something to keep in mind
while watching, many critics
claim that this movie is
Ferrara’s autobiographical
piece.

A few aiiight films from '94:
Dumb and Dumber — I had
never seen a Jim Carrey flick
before this one, and bearing in
mind all the talk about how
this movie represents in some
way a dumbing down of
America, I gotta say, uh, duh,
ah, duh, duh. So it’s the moron
method that’s in, and i like it.
The film tried to be nothing
more than an innocuous
laugh-for-all, and the scata|og-
ical jokes and absurd parakeet
death were nothing more than
funny. “Polly-wanna-cracker,
pretty bird.” (HA!)

Crooklyn — This comes in
right behind Do the Right
Thing as my second favorite
Spike Lee joint. Spike’s cam-
era filmed the familial situation
with the same self-conscious
energy of Do the RightThing,
and Lee’s first screen trip into

 

suburbia was nothing short of
hilarious. A well-coded film
about the ole neighborhood
and ‘70s soul, with lush char-
acter sketches. Ya gotta love
the hyper-vivid glue-sniffing
sequences.

Ready to Wear —— Robert
Altman’s latest celebpic and
extravaganza of miniplot and
locale intermlttance carries an
immediate burden, to begin
with, in that few are going to
give a shit about the fashion
biz — ironic or not. Whereas
The Player offered something
worthy of disdain and
Nashville provided a spongey
canvas for exploration of
parochialism and the broken-
hearted, Ready to Wear is a

tepid soap opera that will

leave audiences more ambiva-
lent toward the fashion indus-
try than when they arrived at
theaters.

Niandra La'Des and Usually
Just a T -Shirt

John Frusciante

American Records

l’m not sure why, but for
some reason l’ve always had
a hunch thatthis guy had the
potential to do something
cool,’ despite the fact that his
old bandmates have become
complete caricatures of them-
selves and will surely have a
Saturday morning cartoon on
Fox to coincide with the
release of their next chart-top-
ping album. If you believe the
story, John Frusciante was
just a 19-year-old geek from
L.A. who got» the chance to
audition as guitarist for his
favorite band, those wacky
Red Hot Chili Peppers, back
in ‘89. The rest is A|terna-hiS-
tory. After two albums’ worth
of funkysexypsychomagikbull-
shit AND tattoos that made
the band millions and millions
of dollars, Frusciante quit the
group in the midst of some
huge intergalactic tour, just
before Lollapaloozaz The
Sequel. He said something
about rock stardom not being
for him and then went home
to count his loot.

“Niandra La Des” is a won-

 

 

derful, psychedelic album,
with 25 songs’ worth of eliptic,
overlayed guitar and vocal
effects and not too much else.
It was recorded by Frusciante
himself (that means Rick
Rubin didn't get his paws on
it) on the hottest new inven-
tion in the record industry  a
4-track. This has to be the
most low-fi a corporate record
has ever gotten the chance to
be. There is also no trace of a
possible hit single/video any-
where on this considerably
lengthy album. He does do a
great version of “Big
Takeover” by the Bad Brains,
singing in his whiny, high-
pitched voice. This record
kind of reminds me of Pat
Smear singing for our local
boy-monster-heroes Sauce
with no percussion.
Frusciante’s lyrics are psue—
do—obscure and extremely
personal, but he pulls it off
well; with lines like “your
pussy’s glued to a building on
fire” he serenades his true
love.

Supposedly, Frusciante
hangs with the same rich,
Hollywood fame junky crowd
that includes Perry Farrell,
Johnny Depp, good old Gibby
Haynes and Al Jourgenson.
This album contains, suppos-
edly, a backwards monologue
by River Phoenix himself
(recorded before his untimely

demise). l’m not sure about all

the hype, but this release
does stand on its own, and it’s
definitely better than anything
the aforementioned people
have put out in a long time.

My So-Called Lite
Thursday, 8PM
AB_C

Television is dominated
these days by the familyicom-
edy, news programs and true-
life dramas, yet the executives
in Hollywood rarely get things
right. These shows seem to
either pinpoint conditions that
the normal viewer cannot
relate to or which they find
utterly repulsive with its cute-
ness. But in the same sense
the average couch potato
seems to want something so
sensational in its portrayal of
“normal life” (i.e. Melrose
Place, or any FOX show for
that matter) or something that
actually reveals real charac-
ters in real situations. The lat-
ter category really has only

one show thatcombines enter-

tainment, good writing, good
acting and most importantly, a
television show that might
actually~be happening in the
real world (not to be confused
with The Real World of MTV
where people have to suffer
living rent-free and whine
incessantly when a roommate
doesn't squeeze the tooth-
paste from the bottom).

That show, My So-Called
Life, stars Claire Daines (co-
star of the recent film, Little
Women) as Angela, a high
school student living in subur-
ban Pittsburgh whom we see
confront life in a real way,
where Subjects such as drugs,
alcohol, sex and friendship are
portrayed not in the typical,
preachy prime-time manner,
but in a realistic and true fash-
ion. Her friends, although
stereotypical in definition (the
nerd next door, the drug user,

the teacher's pet, the child of a
broken home) are constantly
changing as characters and
breaking away from concrete
definitions. Don't be fooled,
this is not a message program,
nor is it Saved By the Bell
(from the five minutes I
watched, that is). It is instead
a program that discusses teen
life and life in general as it
happens. Where else on tele-
vision is homosexuality shown
in a manner so true, where
Angela describes her friend
Rickie as ‘‘I guess he’s bi or
something” and where a gay
teacher must realize what
might happen if he allows a
student to live with he and his
lover? ln Roseanne’s version
of gay life it becomes impor-
tant for a kiss (and laugh
track). My So-Called Life,
even as it does so without the
hype, goes much farther.

As it goes, there are some
problems with the show. The
main characters seem some-
times too good to be true (the
need for constant resolutions),
and there is little differentiation
between their middle-class
lives and, for the most part,
race, but there are many pos-
sibilities to change and better
the program. That is, if it has
the chance.

This show may be the best
thing on television and, unfor-
tunately, very close to cancel-
lation. Why is this critically
acclaimed show doing so
poorly in the ratings? It seems
that the people to whom the
show is targeted are instead
watching programs that fea-
ture characters and situations
that the viewers hope to
become. Opposite MSCL are
NBC’s Mad About You and

January 19 1995

 

Friends, half-hour comedies
that showcase the lives of 20
and 30-year-old’s whose con-
flicts hinge on the insignificant
(See Real World above). Both
shows revolve around the per-
fect lives of people who are
engaged in charming, laugh-a-
minute activities that people
only dream that they them-
selves could live. In all hon-
esty, who wouldn’t like to live
in such situations: great apart-
ments in New York, attractive
friends, active social lives, yet
aren’t those lives that most of
us will never completely have?
Why not watch something that
involves a situation that almost
everyone has or will experi-
ence: high school life in which
for the most part you Say stu-
pid things, are constantly con-
cerned about things with little
or no importance in society
and doing things that you ulti-
mately regret. Sound superfi-
cial and trite? Well, I hate to
break it to you, but adoles-
cence is just that, and ‘when
it’s portrayed in a professional
and entertaining manner, it
makes for good TV. -

lt’S amazing, though, what a
good program can do. I don’t
fit into the focus group of the
show (l’m not a 13 to 18-year-
old girl). l’m a 22-year-old
male who, demographically
speaking, should be watching
the comedies on the other sta-
tion (friends will tell you that I
claim Helen Hunt to be my
perfect woman), and I might if
there wasn’t a scheduling con-
flict. But quality should over-
ride demographics every time,
at least in a perfect television
world.

African-Annerican

With an already gutless PBS now
running scared and the recent cable
channel boom just churning out the
same ole crap, it’s still left to indepen-
dent filmmakers and occasionally those
working on Hollywood's fringes to
come up with stories to deal with the
social issues of the day in any evoca-
tive, dramatic way.

Nowhere is this more obvious than in
the lack of challenging TV program-
ming on African-American issues, but
in recent years there’s been a surge of
independent film production by and
about African-Americans, using both
documentary and fiction, that does it’s
best to make up for boob tube cow-

Murder in the First

Starring Christian Slater,
Kevin Bacon, Gary Oldman
Directed by Marc Rocco

Courtroom dramas usually
are pretty routine and boring.
The hook in the plot usually
comes halfway through the
movie, a key piece of evi-
dence revealed, and the good
guys have to go find it and
save the day for the unjustly
accused. Murder in the First is
no real exception, as a young
and charismatic lawyer on his
first case must reveal the
wrongs which caused his
client to commit murder.

The film begins with a
drawn out history of Henri

KEVIN

 

 

  

Young s (Kevin Bacon) char-
acter; caught stealing $5 from
a post office so that he and
his sister could buy food, he is
sent to Alcatraz to fill up
space among the more
famous. and dangerous crimi-
nals. There, he and three
other inmates try to escape,
but fail when one of them tips
off the prison guards. Young
is sent down to solitary con-
finement, a dark and damp
dungeon where his only con-
tact is an occasional beating
or yearly half hour in the
prison yards. He is left there
for three years, slowly going
insane. When he is finally let
out of the underground cell in
1941, crazed and incoherent,
he attacks and kills the prison-
er who he feels is responsible
for his torture. He is charged
with first—degree murder, a
murder which hundreds wit-
nessed.

Enter James Stamphill
(Christian Slater), a young
and determined lawyer who
feels that his now-catatonic
client must have had other
reasons and motives to kill.
What follows is mostly a two-
person story of the lawyer try-
ing desperately to get through
to his client and also trying to
reveal the terrors of Alcatraz
and its sadistic Assistant
Warden Glenn (Gary
Oldman).

This film, although positive
in its message, fails through
countless stereotypes and
garish cinematography. Each
character is one-dimensional,

judge (R. Lee Ermey) to the
bumbling Warden Humson
(Stefan Gierasch) who doesn’t
know what goes on in his own
prison. The filming is even
worse, with a camera that liter-
ally doesn’t stop moving,
scene after scene. Because
most of the movie is filmed in
either the dungeon, courtroom
or a cell in the San Francisco
city jail, the director, Marc
Rocco, seems to try to create
movement where there is
none, constantly panning in
and out, circling the jail cell,
separating the camera’ and

characters with bars (an image

so heavy-handed that it
becomes redundant almost
immediately).

There are some good points,
including Stamphill sneaking a
prostitute (Kyra Sedgwick) into
the cell with Young, a virgin,

The Browning Version
Directed by Mike Figgis
Starring Albert Finney, Greta
Scacchi and Matthew Modine

Filmed in the time-worn
boys’ school genre, with mis-
chievous adolescents and
stodgy profs, The Browning
Version focuses on a discipli-
narian teach whose tight-
assed British pose has earned
him the epithet, “the Hitler of

‘the lower fifth.” The film offers

ing we haven’t seen before.

endeavor with a simple theme
of affection for humanity to
convey.

The film takes a while to
develop, but once the Victorian
tone is established, it becomes
a character sketch of a lonely
man alienated by the love of
his work. Andrew Crocker-
Harris (Albert Finney) is the
classics professor who tries to
instill the virtues of great litera-
ture in his students, but
instead is more well-known as
the most detested character in

Pih‘ football
is uiet/y
col ecting
big recruits

n the

chanc

e that
football may
be the last
thing that
anyone in
Pittsburgh
wants to read
about right
now, I think
it’s time that
Pitt football
is given some attention
besides being the other sport
of basketball player Nate
“Pitt’s Deion Sanders”
Cochran plays.

As we watch the basketball
team painfully move through
their conference season, Pitt
fans take heart in the news
that next year a crew of hoop-
sters will be here to vault Pitt
to premier status in the Big
East. According to ESPN and
CNN, head coach Ralph
Willard has one of the best
recruiting classes in the
nation.

But in the recruiting busi-
ness, January is prime time
for luring future football stars
to campus, and even com-
pared to Willard, football
head coach John Majors has a
daunting task in resurrecting
Pitt football. Willard picked
up a team which was in the
NCAA tournament as recent
as two years ago, whereas the
football team has struggled
the past several seasons.
However, Majors and his
recruiting staff have been qui-
etly rounding up talent the
Panthers may be able to use
immediately.

Assuming Pitt will give the
NCAA maximum of 25 allot-
ted scholarships, Pitt only has
10 left to give as Feb. 1 draws
closer - the national letter of
intent signing day. Here’s a
quick review of some of the
recent names Majors put on
on his list and players he

 

Columnist

hopes to see in summer camp 2

to help put Pitt’s worst foot-
ball seasons behind us.

According to The
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Pitt
recruits will be coming from
the deep South to lend help to
the Panther squad. Rasshad
Whitmill, defensive back
from Houston, Texas, has
given Pitt an oral commit-
ment, as has Leon Murray of
Shreveport, La. Murray, rated
as one of_the top quarterbacks
in Louisiana, could end up
playing defensive back at Pitt.

Another quarterback recruit
who may be playing defense
at Pitt is Darnell Dinkins,

Pitt loses another heartbreaker, 71-69

By Sean Duncan
Sports Editor

The Pitt basketball team is suspended in
time. They go to battle against the upper-
echelon Big East teams, and the same
result always occurs ——- a game of
should’ves and could’ves, but the \
Panthers can never get over the hump. 

Last night was no different.

The Panthers suffered another heart-
breaking loss, this time to the host

Villanova Wildcats, 71-69.

Again, Pitt had a chance to win but
folded in crunch time. Down by two with
a minute to play, Pitt missed two critical
shots that could have tied the game.

“Well, we got every shot we wanted, we
got good looks at it, but we just didn’t
knock them down,” Pitt coach Ralph
Willard said in a postgame interview. 

But unlike most Pitt games this year, the  '
team played two solidhalves, as opposed I
to its one half of fury and the other of

deadbeat basketball.

The Panthers (4-10 and 0-4 in Big East
play) hung tight throughout the game,
thanks to Jaime Peterson’s career-high 20

points and 10 rebounds.

Down by four with 1:14 remaining,
Orlando Antigua came up with a steal and
cashed it in with a dunk. Then, Wildcat
forward Eric Eberz was fouled and nailed
both free throws, but a lane violation
waived off the second one, which kept
Pitt within a one possession game.  ’

But Antigua’s subsequent three-point
attempt fell way short, and Kerry Kittles
got the rebound and was fouled. Kittles
sunk both free throws, giving the ‘Cats a
five—point cushion, 69-64. Then Eberz,
who finished with a game-high 25 points,
hit two more free throws for good mea-

Staff Writer

It took the Lady Panthers
three minutes to get started
last night against the
Providence Lady Friars, but
when Stephanie Petho hit
Pitt’s first basket, they went
on to roll to an easy 78-51
victory.

The opening five minutes
at Fitzgerald Field House
were marred by sloppy play
and missed layups as
Providence opened an early
7-3 lead.

The Lady Panthers, trig-
gered by the hot shooting of
Petho, went on a 20-2 run to
blow the game open and take
a 23-9 lead.

“We are trying to put an
emphasis on coming out
strong from the get go, “
Petho said, “We usually fall
behind early.”

The Lady Panthers contin-
ued to pile on the first-half
points and after a technical
foul on Providence coach
Bob Foley, the Panthers had
a 35-19 lead. .

The Lady Panthers led 38-
21 at the half as 12 of the 13
players got in the game.

has been great,” he said.
He praised two coaches
in particular, Alison
Williams and Joanne
Warner. He said he is also
impressed with the leader-
ship of the seniors and cap-
tains.

So" who are the people to
watch?

Lewis said the women’s
relay team currently has the
top time in the Big East.
He also said the men’s
team has the top
three sprinters in the Big
East: Dorsett, Jells and
Jones. _

Several people on
the team have already
qualified for postseas

and Martin have each
qualified for four
events, Jells for two, and
Jones and Kesko for one

we just don’t have anyone to

create,” Willard said. “We do

a great job, but we just lose

focus sometimes. We’re bust-

ing our humps defensively, it’s
just tough to manufacture
po1nts.”

One of the reasons for the
loss was a sub-par game from
Antigua. He finished with
only four points, and convert-
ed only one field goal.

Also, point guard Andre
Alridge, who played all 40
minutes with a stretched pec-
toral muscle that he hurt
Tuesday, scored 11 points,
grabbed six rebounds and had
seven assists. But he shot 4-
for-15 from the field.

“We don’t have a back up
point guard,” Willard said. “It
was obvious that their
[Villanova] game plan was to
attack him.”

. Chris Gant collected his
third consecutive double-dou-
ble with an 11-point, 10-
rebound performance.

“I thought Gant played one

heck of a game,” Willard said.
. The lead changed 13 times
in the first half before
Villanova went on a late 8-2
run with 1:55 left in the half.

game was it. Everybody
played well.”

At the half, center Melissa
Thompson led Pitt with 11

points and 6 rebounds. Petho”

rounded out the Panthers in
double figures at the half
with 10 points.

Pitt opened up the scoring
in the second half when
senior co-captain Carol
Morton stripped the ball
from Providence and cruised
in for an uncontested layup.

Pitt, spurred by Morton’s
play, followed with a 8-1 run
and opened up a 46-22 lead.

“We needed a game like
this,” Petho said. “The sec-
ond half we went out and
had fun, which is what we
need to do.”

The Lady Panthers’
momentum slowed midway
through the second half as
sloppy play and fouls were
prevalent.

“The clock kept stopping
in the second half and it was
toughto keep the momentum
going,” Bruce said.

Bruce compared the Lady
Friars to the Pitt men’s team.

“They find a way to keep
clawing at you.”

Even though Providence
kept clawing at The
Lady Panthers, they could
get no closer than 20 points,
trimming the margin to 66-
46 with four minutes
remaining.

The Panthers dominated
the entire contest. Their
leader was Morton. P

Morton had another out-
standing game as Pitt’s ﬂoor

leader. She contributed 9

points, 9 assists and 6 steals.
Her speed on the offensive
and defensive sides was too
much for Providence to han-
dle.

A trio of Lady Panthers
were in double figures.
Thompson led the way
with 15 points, while
Latia Howard and Petho
each scored 13 points.
Thompson also collected 11
rebounds.

By game’s end all 13 Lady
Panthers played and all con-

tributed.

“I’m glad we played as a
team because we had a bad
practice yesterday,”
Thompson said. “I’m
pleased with the perfor-
mance.” '

The Panthers enjoyed a 50-
35 rebound edge
and Providence turned the
ball over 29 times. Pitt also
outshot Providence ‘44 per-
cent to 29.

“We really picked it up on
defense today,” Bruce said.

The win puts Pitt’s record
at ll-4 and 5-2 in the
Big East, which earns them
sole possession of third
place.

On Saturday the Lady
Panthers travel to Villanova
for a key conference game.

“Villanova is really tough
at home. All five of their
starters are seniors,” Bruce
said. ,

“Hopefully we beat them
bad,” Thompson said.
‘‘We’re really starting to gain
confidence. I’m just waiting
for us to explode.”’

real exciting year, but it’s
hard to say because the rules
have changed,” said
D’Amico.

The scoring will now count
only the top four scores out
of the six competitors.
D’Amico said he wouldn’t be
surprised if last place misses
first or second by one or two
points.

“You can’t say you did
bad. It’s going to be very,
very tight. We may lose a
whole bunch of meets, beat-
en by .1 or .2, but we might
win a few by .2 as well. It
can go either way.,”
D’Amico said.

To help his squad prepare
for this format, D’Amico
held an intrasquad meet last
Saturday. It was run in exact-
ly the same way as the meet
this weekend will be, with
warm-ups timed and the
events scheduled in the order

progress of the squad. Only
one gymnast, Karl Chan, will
be out of action this week-
end.

The overall feeling in the
gym is that the Panthers have
the potential to come out and
perform extremely well.

However, there are both
strong and weak points to the
team. D’Amico can’t say that
the team’s strength lies in
one area. He is worried about
high bar, parallel bars and
the rings. These events are
balanced out by the strength
of the vaulting, floor and
pommel horse.

“If pommels hits, I think
we could probably make up
ground  it’s going to be
exciting,” said D’Amico.

The nucleus of the team is
a talented junior class. It is
led by Jason Lannie, who
looks to be the top all-around
performer. There are also
high expectations for junior
Keith Youndt.

“If [Youndt] gets his high
bar act together, he’ll be one
solid all—arounder,” said
D’Amico.

Right behind them is
another junior, Brian
Narvaez. He has been hin-
dered slightly by nagging
shoulder and back problems,
but he will be competing.
Rounding out the juniors are
Chan, Chris Sweeten and
Michael Maurer.

Newcomers to the team
who should play significant
roles are freshman George
Anderson and Eric
Censoprano, a transfer from
New Mexico. Anderson is
expected to solidify the core
of all-arounders. D’Amico
feels Censoprano will add
depth and “a little spark to
all of the performances.”

Scott Carslaw and Chad
Schieken are sophomores
who walked on to the
Panther program last season.
They will help add depth to
the floor exercises. Carslaw
had Pitt’s highest score in
this event last year (9.45).

Senior leadership responsi-
bilities will be taken care of
by Jonathan Shapiro, a pom-
mel specialist, and Michael
Solpietro. Solpietro is
expected to work rings and
the floor.

With four

solid all-

arounders, there seems to be

a great deal of competition
for starting spots.

“As the fifth and sixth men
get better, the one through
four better get better, or they
don’t become the one
through four,” said D’Amico.
“I, don’t care if there’s com-
petition in the gym. That’s

. what makes us betteras a

team.”

who played at nearby
Schenley High School and
earned The Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette Player of the Year
honors. Dinkins, however, is
more of a running-type quar-
terback than Murray, who
passed for 1,746 yards last
season.

More importantly perhaps,
in light of running back Curtis
Martin’s forfeiture of his
senior season, is support for
the Big East’s leading rusher,
Billy West, for next year.
With the graduation of Tim
Colicchio, Chris Patton is the
only tailback with any experi-

ence, and he only has one
year left. At this point, Pitt
has made the short list of two
of the nation’s top running
backs.

Gary Fauntleroy, a 2,289-
yard gainer from New Jersey
and Darnell Eatmon of
Maryland have said Pitt is
among their three final choic-
es. A commitment by one of
these players is crucial to
Pitt’s offensive depth next
season.

To compete for the job of
kicker David Merrick, who’s
leaving after using his single
year of eligibility, Pitt recent-
ly received an oral commit-

ment from Chris Ferencik. In
recent weeks, Majors has also
delivered on his promise to
fill voids in the offensive and
defensive lines, as well as
special teams.

As promising as it is to see
Pitt football attracting so
many quality recruits, you
have to wonder if Pitt will
ever get the cream of the
Western Pennsylvania crop to
stay home.

Yes, we got All-City star
Dinkins, but lost a potential
future All-American in
McKeesport’s Branden Short
to Penn State. Majors has
a long way to go if he is .

to boost Pitt to level competi-
tion with the Nittany Lions,
who look like they’re

going to reserve a spot in the
Rose Bowl for years to

come.

But realistically, I’d like to
believe that as a Pitt senior,
I’ve endured the worst sea-
sons which Pitt revenue sports
will ever play and I’ve tried to
make the best of it. Here’s
hoping the recruiting gurus
are right and I can proudly
talk about my alma mater as a
powerhouse of the Big East.
