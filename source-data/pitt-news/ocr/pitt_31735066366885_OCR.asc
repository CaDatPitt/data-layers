. Students For Peace  
Violate Pitt Preview
Solicitation Regulation

By ALAN DISLER

The recently-approved Stu-
dent Government allocation
and status as a recognized
student organization of Stu-
dents for Peace are in jeop-

‘ ardy as a result of alleged vio-

lations of a Pitt Preview rule.
The ‘rule prohibits student or-
ganizations from soliciting mem-
bers from Preview participants.

Vice-‘Chancellor for Student Af-
fairs Helen P. Rush conﬁrmed
the withholding of the allocation
($52.60*) and the recognition com-
mittee’s reviewing of the organi-
zation’s status. Miss Rush explain-
ed that “at Pitt Preview we don’t
have organizations appealing to
people who aren’t even students
at the University yet.” No organi-
zation is permitted to distribute
“propaganda” at Pitt Preview.

According to a Pitt Preview '

spokesman, the rule in question
stipulates" that no organization
may solicit members of Preview
participants. Distribution of lit-
erature per se is not prohibited.
However, it has been charged
that literature distributed by the

A Students for Peace urged read-

ers to join the organization.

As a result, the $52.60 alloca-
tion approved for the organiza-
tion for a. series of coffee-hours
has been withheld. Also, the rec-
ognition committee will meet at
2 p.m. today to decide whether
the organization shall retain its
recognition, ,

William Weber, president of

‘Students for Peace, said that. “We

(Students for Peace) have adver-

tised through all available pub- -

licity channels, including distri-
buting leaﬂets to Pitt Previewers
concerning our activities for
the International Days of Protest.
It has been charged that the Stu-
dents for ePace was soliciting

freshman for next year. However,

our intent was merely to adver-
tise for this week’s events.”

. Weber continued, saying, “I am
conﬁdent ‘ that any- misunder-
standing will be worked out in

the near future. However, I feel
that an emergency meeting of
the recognition committee and
the freezing of our allocation are
needlessly extreme actions.’

Another aspect of the situa-
tion was brought out by'Student
Government Vice-President How-
ua-rd Ainisman, who claims that
after dialing the Students for
Peace, the person answering made
reference "to Students for a Dem-
ocratic Society (SDS).

Ainisman said that “I don’t
know what the relationship is be-
tween the two organizations. It
could be that they (SDS) changed
their name to become recognized,
but I don’t know.” Ainisman add-
ed that he was not aware of the
position and nature of the SDS-

‘Pitt News’ Hits Distribution P

Wednesday, March 23, 1966

Of ‘Inter - Collegiate Press’

By ALEX D’IPPOLITO

The Pitt News has pro-
tested the distribution of the
new weekly Pittsburgh area
college newspaper, Inter-Col-
legiate Press (ICP), on the
University- campus. Martin

‘Meliker, Pitt News business man-

ager, questioned the legality of
ICP since it is a commercial en-
terprise which -“opens up the
door to other commercial ven-
tures competing with Pitt News
advertising.”

ICP, which has published four ’

issues, originally received permis-
sion from Vice-Chancellor of Stu-
dent Affairs Helen P. plush to
distribute on campus. Miss Rush
responded favorably to the idea
of a newspaper for the ﬁve ma-
jor colleges and universities in

the area and"“couldn’t see that
it overlapped”, with The Pitt
News-.

She emphasized that she does
not want the paper to compete
with The Pitt News and would
favor ICP only “as long as it pro-
tected Pitt News advertising.” —

Larry Bernfeld, graduate stu-
dent in political science at the
University and editor of ICP, said
that the paper is “not designed
to compete with school papers,”
but is instead intended “to an
an information gap which has
existed among the college cam-
puses in the area.”

Meliker’s protest rests on the
University ruling as stated in the
official Handbook that “Commer-
cial advertising circulated on
campus may be soliciated only by
business staffs of student publi-

VISTA Recruiters On Campus
 To Accept Student Applications

University students desir-
ing to help impoverished and
underprivileged Americans
can do so by working as Vol-
unteers in‘ Service —to_»-..Amer-
ica (VISTA), according to
VISTA recruiters on, campus. The
recruiters are on campus this
‘week to accept applications from
interested P students.

After ﬁlling out an application,
students are urged to return them
immediately to the campus‘ rep-
resentatives. The applications will
then be sent to Washington, D.C.,
for evaluation. ‘

According to Sheldon Butts,
VISTA representative from Wash-
ington, the applicants do have to
take a qualifying examination or
an interview. “You are accepted
on the basis of what you say
about yourself,” explained Butts.

He said that those .who’ are ac-
ceptedwill receive notices of se-

lection after one month if their,

«applications were handed in per-
sonally to the campus representa-

tives, or three months if the ap-

plications were mailed ill. Butts
added that three out of every
four applicants are selected.
Selected individuals will receive
a special invitation after 30 days
to attend a VISTA training camp.

 

‘TWO VISTA recruiters discuss their program with a. University stu-
dent. The recruiters will be on campus the remainder of this week.

VISTA training consists of a six-
week program; one-third of which
is classroom discussion and the
rest ﬁeld experience in the area
of assistance they wish to be as-
signed. V

VISTA offers assistance in sev-
eral ﬁelds: urban, rural, migrant
workers, Indians, mental health,
and the Job Corps.

VISTA volunteers receive a liv-
ing allowance depending on the
area in which they are working

and a $50 a month stipend saved-

for them by the government dur-
ing the one year term of service.
Also, volunteers may “reinlist”
up to three years, and during
this time they are given a 2A oc-
cupational deferment from the
Selective Service.

Butts stated that there are now
2,300 VISTA volunteers and that
they plan to have 3,500 by June.
He added that they would like
to maintain a professional ‘core,
drawn from the experienced vol-
unteers.

Gubernatorial Candidate

Casey Stresses Need For Special Session

“A special session of the State

 Legislature to discuss the Univer-

 

sity of'Pittsburgh is deﬁnitely in
order,” emphasized State Sena-

"tor Robert P. Casey of Scranton

at a press conference Monday
morning. Sen. Casey, who has
the. endorsement of the ‘Pennsyl-
vania Democratic State Policy
Committee, was launching his
candidacy for the Pennsylvania
Democratic gubernatorial nomin-
ation.

pointed out that “reduction of
tuition should be forthcoming
immediately.”

Sen. Casey’s running mate, Sen. ,

Leonard C. Staisey of Duquesne,
the Policy Committee’s endorsed
candidate for lieutenant gover-
nor, added that “for the ﬁrst
time, the State has established a
scholarship and loan fund. The
ultimate determination will be
between the two approaches —
state relations or the scholarship
and loan program.”

Sen. Staisey termed the pre-

 
 
  
 
 

“inade- -

ship request proposed by Sen.
Casey, which Sen. Staisey sup-
ported. .

“The question at stake remains
whether or not, we have a ﬁve

centitax on education and a four’

cent program,” Staisey empha-
sized.»He added that it is the
“responsibility of the State to see
that every student has a place
to attend an institute of higher
learning and .doesn’t end up on
the streets, particularly when
he’s qualiﬁed.” ’

have to arrive at a" realistic and
fair level, which will at the. same
time protect the private schools
in the area.”

Pointing ‘out the inadequacies
of Pennsylvania’s current educa-

tional program, Sen. Casey de- ,

clared, “We have the highest
sales tax in the country — but
we rank last in higher education
support. In overall education‘ —
elementary and secondary, as
well as college level, — we are
well below the national average.

Because of the volunteer na-

ture of The Pitt News staff, Meli-1 i
ker said that itwould be too dif- 
ﬁcult to compete with ICP for 7
advertising. “If we were a full-

time organization,” _he said, “we,

would welcome it (competition)

but we aren’t.” I
The issue will be decided by

the Publication Board early next 
month. In the meantime, ICP  

continue to be permitted to dis- I

The Speaking Disease
Be Specific

by Tom Cilcoslci

. A very serious ailment has been discovered among the
student body at this University and it is my solemn duty

‘to inform the students about this condition before an epi-
demic occurs. Before you continue this article it would be
wise to sit down and get a grip on yourself. Panic must be

. avoided at all costs. Perhaps putting your thumb in your
, mouth will help. Thumb in? Grip tight? Then you are pre-
pared.

The illness in question is neither mono
nor meningitis. It is VD. That’s right, Ver-
bal Deterioration, and it is every bit as
serious as it sounds.‘ Full results of an ex-
tensive crash study by the Health Service
are not yet available, but this much is
known; the cause of the condition is over-
exposure to tests, polls, questionnaires, and
surveys.

CIKOSKI A DESCRIPTION of the symptoms is
difficult and even after an in-depth brieﬁng with charts and
graphs by experts I cannot fully explain the danger signals.
‘But I can describe how the condition came to my attention
and this may help you guard yourself and your friends
from infection.

I was in the Tuck Shop idly sipping a cherry-vanilla
Coke when a boy I had not seen since our freshman days
sat down beside me.

“Hello!” I exclaimed, “Long time no see!”

“How are you?” he replied. “Fine; so-so; terrible; all
of the "above; none of the above?”

“I’m okay,” I said, mystiﬁed. “What have you been
up to?” ’

“THE USUAL routine, you know. What’ve you been
doing? Be speciﬁc. Outline where necessary.”

I laughed, for I thought he was joking. “Just trying

to graduate.”
‘M “Say, are you still seeing whatsername? How’s your
1 ‘car running? You goin’ to grade school? Answer any two
«of the above, credit 15.” A

“Aren’t you carrying this too far?” I asked, annoyed.

“Carrying what? Be speciﬁc. Out . . .”

“Are you feeling alright?”

“I’m feeling great'5 . . . 4 . . . 3 . .
he replied. He was sweating.

“Let me get you some water, or maybe something’
‘ stronger.” '

“No,” he said, “I’ve felt this way since Fall '63, ’64,
male, single, L.A., 107 credits.” "

I BECAME alarmed at my old friends behavior. I tried
 to get some help, but the ﬁrst person I stopped and asked
11, said, “What’s wrong? Be speciﬁc. Your name will not be
’ used.” I ran away and left my friend helpless.

So you see the nature and the seriousness of the prob-
lem. I advise you to see a doctor at once to be immunized.
_ -Only through your prompt co-operation an_d action can real

’ tragedy be averted. Have I had myself clear‘? Be speciﬁc.

WILLIAM, CABIN

The fate of a student organization is being decided this afternoon.
The Students for Peace are in danger of losing their status  a Univer-
.sity approved organization when the Committee on Recognition of Stu-
;._-dent Organizations meets. The organization must be judged only'on'the
‘basis of their supposed violations of University rules. The organizations

Students.‘ for Peace has been accused of distributing literature
during Pitt Preview, literature which solicited membership from the Pre-
view participants. Such solicitation is strictly prohibted by the Pitt Pre-
view Committee. Because of the accusation, Vice-Chancellor for Student
Affairs Helen P. Rush has rightfully withheld the organization’s Student

The problem the Recognition Committee faces is an extremely
technical one. The Students for Peace did have the right to distribute
iliterature. They -did not have the right to distribute literature. They did
not have the right to distribute lierature that solicited members. It can
easily be argued that any piece of literature printed by a student organi-
zation could eventually lead to other students joining the group. In any
event, it seems that most the Students for Peace deserves is a strong

But what might be the unfortunate outcome of the meeting is
that the committee would inadvertantly become embroiled in a McCarthy
like witch hunt. Students for Peace is undeniably one of the most con-
violent opposition in other student circles. The group has taken clear cut
troversial student groups on campus. Many of their stands meet with
positions on the most vital issues of our day including United States in-

There is another unfortunate undercurrent that might Dlaglle the

Quality of Trimester
“Mill” Questioned

Editor, The Pitt News:

Judging from copies of" The.
Pitt News which have reached
me, some students at Pitt are
disturbed over the possible elim-
ination of the trimester system.
Of course, any structural change
is to some extent disruptive of
an institution; and were Pitt to
revert to a stand semester sys-
tem, or moveto a quarter sys-
tem, some students would indeed
be inconvenienced. They would
not be able to .get the jumppon
competitors for~summer jobs; and
it would take them three full
years, attending regular sessions
plus summer school, instead of
22/3 years under the trimester, to
get a degree.

But how does the trimester
system affect the worth of that
degree? Quality of instruction

and scholastic achievement may,

be primary determinants of the
value of’ a diploma, but the”rep-
utation of an institution has a

very real cash value. From ' a.

perspective of some distance, it
is clear that many people classify

Pitt as a diploma mill largely.

because of the trimester. There
is some justice in this view; one

of Litchﬁeld’s stated objectives im
instituting the trimester was to
speed up the educational pro-
cess, an objective which, some
people feel conﬂicts with achiev-
ing quality.

_ To the extent that this speed-
.up is associated ’with Pitt, the

time lag between Pitt’s real
achievements and its reputation
is increased, and the valiie of its
diploma lessened. Were the tri-
mester to be eliminated, Pitt’s
struggle to secure acceptance-» as
a quality institution might be
aided.

Timmons’s Coaching

Editor, The‘ Pitt News:

It is my view and that of the
people I represent that the neces-
sary basketball recruiting will
not be done and therefore the
team will never materially im-
prove, as long as the present
coaching staff remains. I.have
seen most of Pitt’s home basket-
ball games for the past 20 years.
I have observed Timmons’ teams
ever since he became coach. Al-

Committee to indulge in a full ﬂedged investigation of the structure of an
organization and the activities of an organization’s leadership. Nor is it
within the committee’s scope to pass judgment on the beliefs of the Stu-
dents for Peace.

It will be a miracle of jurisprudence if the committee members
can set aside their own political beliefs and deal with the -group as if it
was a political sewing circle. But this is their ultimate obligation. While
we realize that it will be difficult to do, we urge that it be done.

F. N. F.

though I am not a coach, I know
a well coached team when I see
one and I know a badly coached
team when ‘I see one.

Pitt’s teams under Timmons
have been badly coached. He does
not really understand the ﬁne

‘points of the game. He knows

nothing about coaching defensive»
basketball. He does not recognize
situations during the course of a
game which require offensive and
defensive adjustment. Most im-
portant of all, Timmons cannot
motivate his players to the point
where they will give every ounce-
of their ability to go all out to
win.

’ Why does Pitt put up with him
when there are so many bright
young coaches around who could
do so much better?

During his entire career he has
had only four teams that parti-
cipated in post-season tourna-
ments, three in the NCAA and
one in the NIT. In each case, the
team got nowhere in tournament

' play.

As I said in my‘ previous let-.
ter, Pitt basketball can be im-
proved. It can even be made into
a big time operation. But a new
0030111118 staff is absolutely essen-
tial. The new coach must i be
everything Timmons is not; he
must be agressive, enthusiastic
and dedicated to Winning basket-
ball. He should know how to re-
cruit, good material.

It is doubtful that the neces-
sary changes will come about un-
less the athletic director is forced
to do so. I hope that you will
help to generate that pressure.

Plans To Work, Study In England

On the basis of his roundness
of character, extracurricular ac-
tivities, and scholastic achieve-
ments, Kenneth Charles Freder-
ick has been awarded the Engi-
neering and Mines International
Travel and Training (EMITT)
Award.

In selecting the recipient of
this award, the committee of fac-
ulty and students look for not
only scholarship, but also indus-
try and application to the engi-
neering profession. Loyalty to the
University and participation in
its many programs are also cited
as qualities needed to receive the
award. The winning engineering
student is sent overseas for trav-
el and industrial experience.

Frederick is a metallurgical en-
gineer. His present activities in-
clude serving as president of the
Interfraternity Council, as Stu-
dent Government senator, vice-
president of the metallurgical
seminar, a member and past pres-
ident of Sigma Alpha Epsilon so-
cial fraternity, and a member of

. A2,‘, .,,<~ ‘Q,
Phi Eta Sigma, Druids, Order of
Omega, Omicron Delta Kappa,
and Sigma Tau.

Frederick will be leaving for
Chester, England, in June. He will
work for John Summers and Sons
Ltd. a. company producing steel

strip mill products. His pay will

be a minimum of eight pounds
sterling ($23) per week, enough
to meet the cost of living in the.
United Kingdom.

The EMITT program is now in
its 11th year at the University. In
order to guarantee the program’s
continuation, the Engineering and
Mines Cabinet donated $500 to
the awardees to aid in the cost.
This year’s award will once again
be ﬁnanced in the Cabinet, with
no funds from local industry.

CLAIR RILEY
Enters NCAA tournament.
Panther wrestling fortunes

have come along way in two
. years. The only trouble is the

path they have followed has

been downhill. Two years
ago a full team was sent to the

A ,NCAA tournament. Clair Riley

"left today as the only Panther
representative for this year's
tournament at Iowa State.

“There is an unwritten rule
now that you have to be one of
the top two ﬁnishers in the East-
erns in order to go to the Na-
tionals,” explains coach Dave
Johnson. “They only allow a full
team to be sent if it has a good
chance to take the team title
such as Lehigh.”

Jack Williams, the Eastern 191-
pounder runner-up was supposed
to have kept Riley company this
weekend, but an asthma attack
prevented him from practicing
‘ and as a result has kept him
from making the trip.

ack Sidelines Williams

It was a bad break for Wil-
liams since the 191-pound champ,
Bob Buchwald of Cornell, also
won't be going to Iowa. The Ivy
League is currently boycotting
NCAA sponsored tournaments.

“I’m sorry Jack couldn’t go,”
said Johnson. “If he had been
on, he could have had a pretty
good shot at the title with Buck-
wald not entering.” '

Riley, a senior, will be making
his ﬁrst trip to the Nationals. He
felt he could win at the Eastems,
but he's not making any predic-
tions now. “I feel lucky to be go-
ing, but in a tournament like this
you don’t know where you stand,”
says Clair. “There are so many
people entering you’ve never
heard about.” A

There are six trophies award-
ed in each weight class and
Johnson is hopeful his pupil will
be able to come back home with
one of them. A lot will depend
on the seeding, however.

“It will be great if he places,”
said Johnson. “He's worked hard
for three years and he really de-
serves a trophy.”

__   Hahnfeldit Receives en E 
To NCAA Swim Meet.

‘Don Hahnfeldt, diver and co-captain of the swimming
team this season, has received an invitation to the National
Collegiate Championships held at the Air Force Academy

!v

be

through Saturday.

This marks Hahnfeldt’s second
appearance in the NCAA cham-
pionships and his second appear-
ance in a post season tourna-
ment this year. Two weeks ago,
he competed in the Eastern Col-
legiates. In that meet, Hahnfeldt
placed second in both the one-
meter and the three-meter div-
ing events.

“In my sophomore. year, I went
to the NCAA meet and ﬁnished
about 18th’ or 19th,” Hahnfeldt

_ said. ‘‘Right now I "feel pretty

good but not real sharp; I guess
I am just like I was for the East-
erns.”

There will be approximately"

50 or 60 divers contesting for
honors in this big tournament.
The ﬁnals in the one-meter event
are scheduled for tomorrow; the
ﬁnals in the three-meter event
are set for Saturday.

In the preliminaries, each diver
performs ﬁve dives. Sixteen are
chosen, from these and they do
three more dives. For the ﬁnals,
the top 12 divers compete.‘ From
the ﬁnalists, the NCAA committee
selects its All-American team.

“In big meets before large au-
diences and under pressure, I
tend to do better,” Hahnfeldt

said. “When they cut the ﬁeld’

for the ﬁnals, I want to be. one

of those top 12 divers. That is.

what I am shooting for. If. I
have one good day in the meet,
I’ll make the ﬁnals.”

In the meet, Hahnfeldt will be
going against the stiffest of com-
petitors. Ken Sitzberger from In-
diana University is a past NCAA
and Olympic champion. Ohio
State’s Randy Larson, another
favorite, won the title two-years
ago as a sophomore. Bruce Brown
of Michigan State and Dan Mc-

Lean of the Air Force are two

We2inesd“a‘y,?‘1iiiiréii 

All-Americans who also have a
good chance.

Concerning board height, Hahn-
feldt feels he is as good on the
one as he is the three-meter
board, but he “has not worked
out on the one-meter (except in
the Easterns) since high school. -
“In dual meets we dive from
the three-meter board so I nat-
urally concentrate on it,” he said.
