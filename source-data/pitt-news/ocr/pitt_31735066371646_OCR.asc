 The University of Pittsburgh’s

School of Medicine has just been
awarded a $350,000 federally funded
grant from the National Institute of,
Health to develop a new weight con-
trol program for diabetes patients.

Of the nearly 10 million diabetics
in the United States, 9 million are
overweight and have non-insulin
dependent, or type 2, diabetes. This
combination of diabetes and obesity
places these patients at increased
risk for the development of heart
" disease.

Airlift

The University Counseling and Student Develop-
ment Center provides assistance.

Weight loss is beneficial because it
lowers the level of blood sugar and
decreases the risk of heart disease.
Pitt researchers will be offering two
behavioral weight control programs
specifically for type 2 diabetic
patients during the three-year study.

Rena R. Wing, director of the
school’s program for diabetics,
stated that ‘although. diabetic
patients are always encouraged to
lose weight, their efforts are usually
unsuccessful because they’re only
handed a diet or told to join a com-
mercial weight control program.

“We have been working to
develop a program speciﬁcally for
these diabetic patients that teaches
them about diabetes and shows
them how to improve their blood

sugar by making some changes in
their diet and exercise,” Wing said.

One program will be for over-
weight- diabetic patients and their
spouses and will examine ways to
involve both beneficially. Prelimi-
nary research indicates more than 50
percent of the overweight diabetics

are married to spouses who are also

diabetic.

The other program will study the
effects of exercise as part of a weight
control program for diabetic
women. -

Both programs will be based on‘

highly successful behavior modifica-,
tion techniques which focus on

' changingeating and exercise habits

through exercise and group support.

Administration 
appoints acting    
engineering dean    

By Dirk Kaufman.
The Pitt News

Vowing to re-establish the trust
between the faculty of the School of
Engineering and administration
officials, Y.T. Shah has begun his
term as acting dean of the engineer-
ing school.

University President Wesley Pos-
var informed the faculty of Shah’s
appointment in a letter distributed
Jan. 3. Shah, who is the chairman of
the civil engineering department,
will retain the position until Posvar
and his staff finish compiling and
selecting a candidate from what Pro-
vost Roger Benjamin described as a

2 list of “thelargest possible national

pool of candidates.” Benjamin
stressed that the list would consist of
candidates from both inside and
outside the university. He estimated
that the. list would be completed
sometime in April. '

Last night marked the beginning
of a new phase in student govern-
ment as president-elect Luke
Kluchko and nine new Student
Government Board members were
inaugurated. "

Approximately 150 parents, stu-
dent ‘leaders and distinguished
guests were on hand to witness the
swearing-in of the‘ new president by
former board president Ken Stram.
Kluchko in turn swore in the 1985
board. Vice President for ‘Student
Affairs Dr. Conney Kimbo wel-
comed the l985 SGB and congratu-
lated the 1984 board, wishing them
continued success. According to
Kimbo, interest shown in the elec-
tion through strong voting trends
confirmed that students are taking
more of an interest in their govern-
ment. As a result, Kimbo urged that
the board take the time to talk to the

. students —' all of the students, and

not just their friends. He then
offered the incoming board his con-
tinued cooperation._ “It will be an
exciting and, I hope, a meaningful
year for all of us,” Kimbo said.

" Ken Stram, 1984 SGB_‘president,
echoed Kimbo’s sentiments and con-
gratulated both the new and the old
members of the SGB. He said that he
felt the 1984 board members had
learned valuable things through

- their experience, adding that four

Shah complimented Williams for *
his work in developing interaction
between the undergraduate ‘and.
research programs. He felt that Wil-
liams had done well in anchoring the
undergraduates in the research pro--*
gram. Shah said that one of his
major objectives as acting dean will
be to insure that there was more ,
“openness and .communication_
between faculty and administra- 

V tion.” _

Williams is on leave this termand, - ?_ 
the resignation from the post of dean 0‘
will become effective June 30. Willi-
ams informed the administration of A
the decision roughly two months . ,.
after a letter was drafted « by. » ‘

ment criticizing Williams’ abilities as, , A

"Black Jews, they are so warm to get
involved, so fast you find you are
their brother."

Its major southern ﬂank is often‘
nicknamed the Big Horn. The vast-
ness is that overwhelming in Africa.
Lush plant life and countless herds
of wild animals used to smear the
landscape. ‘

Due to a variety of factors, yester-

‘ day's horn of plenty is now largely a

desert wasteland. With the scorch-
ing sun and cracked, eroded earth
has come starvation, famine and
drought. Thousandshave and will
die from severe malnutrition in 16
countries, including Kenya, Zim-
babwe, Somalia, the Sudan and
Uganda.

Many, that is, except for those of
Ethiopian Jewish heritage. It is in
th'at country where human suffering

is perhaps at its worst. And it is the-
estimated 20,000 black Jews in .Efhi'-I '

opia who,'if not already, will benefit
from “Operation Moses."

The Israeli government,'in a show
of strength some say unparalleled in
that state’s 36-year history, has col-

laborated with other nations and a ‘
». Belgian air carrier to airlift approxi-

mately half of those Jews still surviv-
ing in Ethiopia to the Jewish
homeland.

A news leak last week supposedly
halted the previously secret mass
exodus, believed to be in its third
month now. According to one
Israeli who recently arrived from
one of Israel’s several absorption
centers, not onlywill the trickle con-
tinue, despite reports to the con-
trary, but the emigration is nearly 18
months old.

Shlomo Shoham, 34, a Squirrel
Hill-based shaliach (community
ambassador) arrived from his home-
town of Sefat two months ago with
tales of more dilemmas the displaced
Ethiopians face in Israel and claims
that the allegedly damaging news
leak may actually beneﬁt the 10,000
or so Jews still suffering in Ethiopia.

“I think that since the topic didn’t
get enough attention all these years,
it needed a striking thing to make it
news," Shohamisaid. “I can under-
stand the leak. Probably trying to
get enough attention [Israeli offi-
cials] blew it out much longer than
they meant. The leak does not have

_ to end with a negative note. It will

bringmassive help from national
and foreign officers in London and

' Bank's) Kiryat Arba, Ashkelon and

 

The pm 'New?s;?Fridayjaniiary -«I 1‘: was

Ethiopians face strange new life   inlsrael    

Washington and elsewhere. It
doesn’t all depend on Israel. Big
things like this Israel shouldn’t do
alone."

“Since the project was secret, in a
short time you had to prepare people
to work with them," Shoham said.
“Sometimes it was too short a time.
Some were not highly professional.
It shows that since [volunteers] don‘t
have enough time to prepare, they
couldn’t learn what the customs of
these people were. The absorption
centers are poorly equipped. You
have enough beds, but there are no
games for the kids. They came out of
there with nothing. They had to be
dressed totally from beginning to
end. They had to be told
everything.” '

The airlift aside, Israel is going at
it alone, providing for complete inte-
gration of a largely impoverished,
but Jewish, people. Including Sefat,
the Ethiopians also arrive in (West

Eilat. It has already been estimated
that Israel, despite its triple-digit
inflation, will spend nearly $25,000
on each airlifted Ethiopian.

According to Shoham, though,
absorption centers are severely
understaffed and volunteers aiding
integration are undereducated,
making dealing with the inﬂux even
more difficult.

Shoham also noted that those
aged 25 to 55 years old often pass
their days in Israel idly, the teaching
of professional skills has lately been
so lacking. And if they are not

“bored,” Shoham added, they use
monthly allowances courtesy of the
Jewish Agency in. two or three days’
time. '

It stems, he explained, from an
unplanned life in Ethiopia due to
radical climate, regimes and socio-
economics. “They are very ready to
be poor tomorrow if they haveta lot
today," Shoham said.

Despite this, he quickly noted:
“One, we shouldn't care how they’re
brought out. Two, stress the very
hard time these peoplehave in any
case. Just moving from any culture
to the Israelis, it’s another world
completely. Three, it's giving world
Jewry the greatest deal of the cen-
tury. And the only plan is they will
be brought to Israel, the only coun-
try that can take them out. One of
the ministers thinks this is the most

important thing that happened to
Israel  even better than Entebbe
[I976 hostage release].”

Shoham absolves past or present
Israeli governments of apathy
toward the previously forgotten
Ethiopian Jews. After former Presi-
dent Yitzchak Ben-Zvi was the first
to recognize these hidden African
Jews, it wasn.'t_until about five years

itself in relieving them of continual
persecution and dire poverty.
Several wars against neighboring
Arab states, working to save Soviet
Jewry and the actual building and
rebuilding of a young state under
constant siege. all contributed to the
Ethiopians‘ extended plight.

(Editor's note: "This is the first of a
two-part series on Jews in Ethiopia.)

Posvar’s Pals ~

In its Sept. 13, 1984 issue, the University Times printed a quiz
on page 9 titled “What Is Your P.Q.? Or, How Well Do You
Know This University?” Fortunately for the University admin-
istration, most people's answer to that question is probably
“not very.” In an attempt to right this state of affairs to some
degree, The Pitt News shall answer one of the questions asked
in that quiz.

The particular question that we wish to address is the second
question under the subhead “Campus Life,” though we have
recast the question to save time and space. The question is:
Who are the Air Force Mafia?

Before spilling the proverbial beans, we would probably do
well to explain what the Air Force Mafia is. It is, in the
university's own words, “a contingent among the administra-
tive team assembled by Wesley Posvar when he became chan-
cellor in 1967  Pitt still employs a number of administrators
who served in either the US. Air Force or its forerunner, the
U.S. Army Air Corps.” In fewer words, the Air Force Mafia are
Wesley Posvar’s old army buddies and buddies of buddies:
Edward Bozik, assistant chancellor, director of athletics;
Joseph Dutton, vice president, business and finance; Jack
Freeman, senior vice chancellor, administration; John R. Qua-
troche, secretary, board of trustee; Bernard Kobosky, vice
chancellor, public affairs.

This friendly little group of cronies is responsible for the
unnecessary undergraduate tuition increases, slashing of bud-
gets, proposals of doing away with GSPIA and the School of
Pharmacy and shady hiring practices —— as in the case of the
new vice president of health sciences — with which we are
becoming increasingly.

We can only expect so much, however. Would it be reas6na-
ble to expect a body that seems to have been assembled wrongly
— that is, on the basis of nepotism — to act in an opposite
manner? Apparently not. Actions do, indeed, speak louder
than words. ‘

Life and Death

We avoid life and hide from death. Birth is welcome because

it brings us something —— the child is like a gift. The receiving of i

any gift first requires giving. This is so basic it could be left
unsaid. But why, when giving doesn’t guarantee receiving, are
we so afraid to do it? Why is it assumed that because nothing is
gained, something is inevitably lost, and even if that were true,
so what?

Every day, it seems we wrap ourselves up in activities that
keep us happily preoccupied and distracted from these real
questions. Then one day, someone very special, perhaps a very
special relative or a good friend, dies unexpectedly.

It is paradoxical that by avoiding giving because of the fear
of pain or loss, we actually produce-through fear the pain we try
so hard to avoid. Nothing can be lost if it is truly given. And no
one can steal you unless you let them. When one gives freely of
himself, of his time and of his abilities, he is an inspiration to all
who know him. We will always remember him for that.

Letters to the Editor

Suicide?

I am a member of the Brown Uni-
versity group “Students for Suicide
Tablets." Much of the publicity has
distorted our message by emphasiz-
ing the word “suicide. ” For example,
a New York Times headline read,
“Students to Vote on Suicide.” It is
important that our ideas be
understood.

Our referendum, which passed by
a 60 percent majority but is not bind-
ing on the university, requests that
“suicide tablets be stocked at
Brown's Health Services for
optional student use in the event of a
nuclear war." This is not a suicidal
or defeatist approach to the threat of
nuclear war. It is aimed at dispelling
the notion that we could survive
such a holocaust. Suicide pills
negate civil defense. In a nuclear
war, there is no defense (unless, per-
haps, you are a general or president,
with access to deep underground
shelters). Hoping for survival is dan-
gerous, because it makes the idea of
nuclear war more acceptable, and
thus increases the chances that it
could occur.

Many Brown students voted for
the referendum to express their fear
and despair in a purely symbolic
way. Others actually want Brown to
stockpile the pills, because they con-
sider the threat of nuclear war a real
one. Would the idea of suicide seem
so bizarre if you were dying a slow,
painful death from radiation sick-
ness? It would be more akin to

euthanasia. Would it be dangerous ’

to stockpile poison on a college cam-

A pus? Well, the chemistry building at -

Brown is already chock-full of
deadly substances, including cya-
nide, that could be used by some
unbalanced person. to harm himself
or others. Suicide pills could be
secured in a vault and would pose no
danger. By stockpiling real pills, we
would emphasize that nuclear war is
a real threat. The missiles sure are
real-

Is stockpiling suicide pills tanta-
mount to accepting nuclear war?
Hardly. Who wants to kill himself?
Most of us don’t. By equating
nuclear war with suicide, we are urg-
ing people to stop it from happen-
ing. What can be done? Well, a
mutual, veriﬁable freeze on the pro-
duction of nuclear weapons would
be a start. Ronald Reagan’s strategy
of “negotiating from strength” has
accomplished nothing. If we
increase our stockpile of nuclear
weapons, why would the Soviet
Union want to decrease theirs? Rea-
gan claims that he has brought
America back from a position of
weakness to one of strength. This is
misleading. The United States has
never been strategically weaker than
the Soviet Union. We have been at
parity with each other since the six-
ties, when we list our strategic super-

iority (this is exactly what an outer '

space “defensive" system would do,
if successful). But this will not
increase our security. On the con-
trary, it is destabilizing and danger-
ous, not to mention draining on our
economy. Superiority is dangerous
because it promotes the idea that a
“victory” is possible, and like hoping
for post-war survival, it increases the

chances that a nuclear war would

OCClII'.

Even if both sides cut their stockpile
of nuclear warheads by half, there
would still be enough firepower with
which to destroy ourselves. Better
relations with Moscow are essential.

'- This means more than simply meet-

ing with the Soviets. It entails,
among other things, a re-evaluation
of our position in the world vis-a-vis
the Soviet Union and the Third

. World. Should we continue to con-
- ,‘ fuse internal, popular revolutions
with Soviet expansionisiri? Why did

4

But arms control is not enough.

the administration smother for six
months a government report stating
that the Soviets are not controlling
Nicaragua? Our dogmatic, inflexible
approach to leftist governments is,
ironically, pushing these countries
toward the Soviet Union, and devel-
oping new opportunities for a con-
flict that could go nuclear. We must
correctly evaluate when our security
is being threatened, and when it is
not. And we must not only stop the
anti-Soviet rhetoric, but also com-
municate to Moscow our sincere
desire to co-exist in peace. This may
seem naive to some, but it is less
naive than equating greater numbers
of missiles with greater security.
These ideas are not new and they
are only some of the ways on which
to avoid nuclear war. But the Rea-
gan administration has done
nothing in this direction. The pur-
pose of requesting suicide pills for
use in a nuclear war is to show at
students are afraid, that they on-
sider nuclear war a distinct possibil-
ity in_their future, and that they
consider such a war unendurable.
The government must discard “de-
fensive” Star Wars weapons projects
and dubious civil defense plans. We
must act now, before a war is
started, to prevent nuclear suicide.

F ralic No
Choirboy

What is _the real reason Bill Fralic
was once again passed over for the
Lombardi and Outland awards? He
is the obvious choice based on his
phenomenal achievements on the

-* football field. He is without a doubt

the most consistent, durable and
powerful lineman in college football
today. The awards created to honor
such an athlete have once again been
dangled before him then yanked
from his grasp. Perhaps the coaches
and sportswriters who vote for the
players use criteria other than grid-
iron excellence to make their selec-
tion. I think a player’s chances of
being chosen are tremendously
enhanced if they play for a winning
team. The morality of a choirboy
wouldn’t hurt either. One man can
only do so much. Why do these du-
bious football “experts” punish a
player for the poor performance of
his team, despite that player’s val-
iant efforts?

I think it must be infinitely more
difficult to maintain the determina-
tion to play well when your team is
doing so badly. I say we make the
selection of players for these awards
more honest. Instead of hiding
behind the guise that these awards
are solely for individual gridiron
achievement, let’s - add the other
requirements. Next year let’s give
these prestigious awards to the foot-
ball player who 1) plays great_ foot-
ball, 2) plays for a winning team-(a
consistently winning team would be
best), 3) saysgonly nice things " in
interviews, whether they are trueior
not. Better yet, if the coaches,
sportswriters and sportcasters can't
make an unbiased decision, maybe
they should take their awards and
stuff them up their defensive ends!

Sexcrime

Your editorial on marital rape
(Dec. 3, 1984) took quite a strong
position on a topic you apparently
know little about. First, the fact that
a law exists only means that criminal
legal action can be initiated. What
the marital rape bill specifies.is that
the same grounds for a rape convic-
tion should be applicable even ifthe
assailant is legally married to the vic-
tim. With the new bill, the reporting
requirements are stiffer and the
penalties lessened. For conviction to
occur, or even formal charges
brought, there would have to be col-
laborating evidence in a marital rape
charge. Typically, cases would not
be prosecuted unless there were wit-
nesses and/ or hospital or other med-
ical records of the traumatic results
of the assault.

My own research on marital rape
has indicated that such rapes are
typically quite violent and often lead
to the dissolution of the marriage.
The wife being able to sue for
divorce does not redress the crime
that has been committed if her hus-
band has raped her. Additionally,
marital rape often occurs as mar-
riages are inthe process of breaking
up and may involve couples who are
already separated. I find it hard to
believe that one would say that
someone should not be brought to
court for committing a crime.

Figures Absurd

In response to the Soviet dissident
on the 67,000,000 victims ‘of Soviet
leadership printed on pages 11 and
12 of The Pitt News (Oct. 31, 1984), I
find it most ridiculous. Where did he
get these figures?

I shall only deal with the
67,000,000 victims. The other
143,417,000 I leave to the intellegen-
cia on the Pitt campus to cope with.

If we take czarist Russia 'and her
population of 1914, we find it to be
about 180,000,000 souls. (Any 1914
almanac shows this.)

Now if we subtract approximately
2,000, dead from World War I up to
1917, when the Russian nation
rebelled against czarism, that leaves
us with approximately 178,000,000
people.’

Now if we take the deaths attrib-
uted to the revolution and the inter-
vention of about 14 nations plus the

..“cordon sanitaire" of the Russian
nation from 1917 to 1922, we have at
least a conservative 5,000,000
deaths. That naturally will bring the
population of Russia to about
1 5,UUU,U()U.

Now we also must subtract the
populations of Finland and Poland,
which left the young Soviet Union
that was formed in the year 1922, I
believe. Both above nations com-
prised about 15,000,000 people.
That leaves us A with about
158,000,000 Soviets in the year 1922.
- From 1917 to 1922, the birth rate
of Russia can be considered at “0"
level. 0  . 4 

Now, from 1922 to 1941 equals
about 19 years of Soviet population
growth which in round numbers
should come in ahmjg 30_000,00()
people. Added to 158,000,000 Soviet

citizens, we come to a grand total of_

188,000,000 people of Soviet Russia
who would confront the German
Nazis and her allies, presumably, in
the “war of 1941-1945. .
, i But from this 188,000,000, let us

continued from page four
now subtract these 67,000,000 vic-
tims of Soviet oppression and we get
the grand total of 121,000,000 Soviet
souls confronting a Nazi coalition of
at least 300,000,000 people.
Included in thisﬁgure are practically
the whole of Western Europe with
the exclusion of Great Britain.

Plus, the Soviets had to contend
with the borders of Afghanistan,
Iran, Turkey and the million-man
Japanese Kwantung Army in the
Soviet Far East during WW II.

I Let us look a little closer at this
67,000,000 victims of Soviet
oppression.

If a Steeler fan were to see every
Steeler game at home, considering
that all 16 Steeler games were played
in Three Rivers Stadium and drew
approximately 60,000 fans for each
game, that would give us about
960,000 fans in attendance per
season.

To attain the figure of 67,000,000
people it would take about 70 sea-
sons or approximately 70 years!
Ridiculous!

Now in all sincerity, what person
will in his lifetime see 67,000,000
people?!

And for the ridiculous sake of
argument, if the dissident’s figures
are fact, how in the world did the
Soviet Union defeat Nazi Germany
and her allies the Eastern Frontiwith
so few people?

The dissident‘s figures are not
only ridiculous, but asinine, and I
shall tell my child and grandchildren
so.

More Campus
Cops

An important point has been
raised about just what the limita-
tions are to the jurisdiction of Pitt's
campus police. For example, sup-'
pose that I got into a fist fight with a
Pitt student out here in East Liberty.
Could the campus police come all
the way out here to ‘arrest me?
Apparently so. Their announced
policy is that their authority extends
anywhere in the city. I have read
about how they have stake-outs off
campus and go anywhere in the city
to make arrests. Why shouldn’t off-
campus matters be left to the city

' police?

What if a Pitt student living in
off-campus housing has a dispute
with his landlord over the security
deposit? Would that be a matter
adjudicated by a campus police

court? I understand the campus.

police regularly arrests non-students
for offenses taking place off campus.
They must, be regularly patrolling
off campus to be doing this.

When I went to Pitt, I never heard
of campus police exercising such
sweeping authority.

From under My Desk/ Dan Bates
Requiem For Christmas  

Yesterday, I finally got around to
removing my small dried-up Christ-
mas tree. I dragged the tree across
the rug to the back door and, of
course, left most of the spiny needles
in the carpet. With some effort, I
attempted to pick out the needles,
knowing full well that I would prob-
ably continue to find needles in the
rug right up until next Christmas.
That is, if there is a next Christmas
at all.

Looking back on this past Christ-
mas, I must admit that I am quite
relieved that the holiday is over. This
feeling of mine really has little to do
with the $74 yellow citation awarded
to me by a pleasant state policewo-
man over the holiday.

Nor does this attitude stem from
the fact that I was involuntarily hit
with three bad colds and a common
illness brought about by the festive
holiday “spirits.” The department
store bill I just received in the mail
doesn’t even bother me that much.

I guess I was set back slightly

when I found out that I was allergic ‘

to Christmas trees and when a scale I
stood on revealed an excess of about
10 pounds, but these things did not
cause me to celebrate when the holi-
day ended. -
Frankly, I'm relieved that the
Christmas holiday has ended
because, for a _while, I wondered if

there would even be a Christmas this
year at all.

You see, “The Grinch That Stole
Christmas" is coming to life. No, no,

not really an actual grinch from that '

cutesy cartoon, but rather the idea
that someone, singular or plural, is
trying little by little to steal away
Christmas (or at .least the popular
symbols of Christmas).

Let's begin with the manger scene.
Throughout the country, manger
scenes have been the center of con-

_troversy: Should or shouldn’t they

be displayed in public places? I sup-
pose that by displaying these
creches, thegovernment is forcing
its religious doctrines on the people
of this country. Well, let’s be
realistic.

First, Christmas is a national holi-
day, right? Manger scenes represent
the very basis for Christmas. There-
fore, why shouldn’t they be dis-
played right next to the Christmas
trees, colored lights, Santa Claus
and the partridge in a pear tree (well,
let’s not get carried away)? Besides,I
find the manger scene much more
meaningful and appealing than
those abstract sculptures of twisted
metal with paint so often seen in
public places. (What do they mean?)

Locally, people fought to remove
_certain Christmas carols from a high

school’s music program. Again,

\:_. ﬁ"", _/_// ~_, 4.’;

Christmas _suffered a devastating
blow. “Rudolph the Red-nosed
Reindeer” and “Frosty the Snow-
man” are cute songs, but let’s face it,
they have no depth and I really can‘t
picture high school students spend-
ing an entire music class singing such
simple and shallow songs.

In some area malls and shopping
centers, the Salvation Army andits
team of bell ringers were also cut
from the festive season. Well, at this
point, why not? They've stolen other
traditional Christmas symbols, so
why not remove from the holiday
the spirit of giving as -well? The Sal-
vation Army undoubtedly collected
much less money for the poor this
year. But they and their bells
annoyed customers. At least many
shop owners thought so.

You know, pushy salespeople
annoy me. Loudspeakers announc-
ing red-, white- and blue-light spe-
cials grind on my nerves. Santa's
elves trying to make a buck by tak-
ing pictures of children on Santa’s
lap aggravate me. Stampeding
crowds of last-minute Christmas
shoppers really give me a headache.
And the bell-ringing soldiers of the
less fortunate stood for a good
cause! -»

What will become of Christmas
next year? Perhaps the Environmen-
tal Protection Agency will prohibit

During any student's college
career, he is bound to encounter
times of anxiety, problems with rela-
tionships, depression and any
number of other stressful situations.
Some students find that they are
able to overcome their problems
without seeking help. For those who
need someone to talk to, the Univer-
sity Counseling and Student Devel-
opment Center can provide
assistance.

According to Dr. Robert Gal-
lagher, director of the service, the
counseling center was established in
1956 by Dr. Charles Peake, who was
hired as a consultant by the univer-
sity. Peake wrote a paper in support
of establishing such a service which
“should do everything possible to
become identified with the emotion-
ally ‘normal’ and with the very able
students.”

Over the years, the counseling ser-
vice has diversified into four separ-
ate areas.

— _»‘.‘-:——v—r-]...'..Ar..f.-..].--

The Learning Skills Center offers
students individual consultation,
various workshops on improving
their learning skills, math tutoring
and preparation for graduate
exams. 1

The Career Development compo-
nent. provides career counseling, a
career library, seminars and help in
planning a career.

Another division of the center is
Disabled Student Services. It offers
disabled students assistance with
locating housing, tests and campus
accessibility. -

The Psychological Services Unit
provides individual and group coun-
seling and marriage counseling. The
unit also offers personal growth
workshops and psychiatric
consulation.

Currently, the Psychological Ser-
vices Unit is staffed by six psycholo-
gists. They see about 1,200 students
a year. In order to make an appoint-
ment to see a counselor, students can
either phone or come into the office.
They will be assigned to a counselor
who will help them until their prob-
lem is cleared up. ‘Typically, only

The Pitt News,‘ iégiaay; ‘jaiuagyii ii, '1'985 P S

ling center

three or four weekly sessions are
needed.

If a student feels uncomfortable
with his counselor, he has the option
of switching to another one. The stu-
dent can also request a specific
counselor.

The counselors treat problems
ranging from general anxieties to
specific fears. Gallagher said the vast
majority of patients’ problems con-
cern relationships. People expe-
riencing anxiety, depression, loss of
self-esteem and concern over their
careers comprise the remainder of
the patients seen at the center.

According to its patients, the cen-
ter is doing a good job. Seventy to
eighty percent of the patients
reported they were extremely
pleased with the center’s work. Not
only were they pleased, but about 40
percent said the center helped them
to remain in school.

‘Although l,200 people come to
the center each year, Gallagher said
one of its biggest problems is getting
people to come for help. He said,
“We constantly work hard at trying
to reduce the stigma associated with
coming in to see a psychologist.”

. PHILADELPHIA (UPI) '—
_A Philadelphia woman gave
birth yesterday to three girls and
a bov at Albert Einstein Medical
Center. A hospital spokeswom-
an said the mother, 20-year-old
Louisiana Perez, had not taken
any type of fertility pill.

She said the babies were born
seven months prematurely.
Perez was diagnosed as having a
complicated pregnancy and had
been in the hospital for the past
19 weeks. The babies range in
weight from I pound, 4 ounces to
1‘ pound, six-and-a-half ounces.
All are being treated in Einstein‘s
intensive care unit for newborns.

A staff of at least 25 physi-
cians, nurses and support staff
aided in the delivery.

According to the hospital
spokeswoman, spontaneous
quadruplets occur in one in",
729,000 pregnancies. ’

, PHILADELPHIA (UPI) -
The Philadelphia Common
Pleas Court has dropped bur-
glary charges against a man who
spent 14 months in jail for two
crimes he didn't commit. The
charges were dropped against 27-
year-old ‘James Rota of Philadel-
phia after authorities discovered
that the charges were a mistake.

PROVIDENCE (UPI) — At
least 6,000 of those fake Cabbage
Patch Dolls have been kept off
the market. A jewelry-maker in
Providence, R.I.. faces arraign-
ment this month on charges that
he smuggled dolls into the U-
nited States and made false state-
ments to customs. The
jewelry-maker said the container
was filled with porcelain.

PHILADELPHIA (UPI) -
A federal judge in Philadelphia
has granted a request by the state .
attorney general‘s office that a
former state senator repay more
than $60,000 for putting two
female friends on the senate pay-
roll but not requiring them to
work. Judge Alfred Luongo
ordered Henry Cianfrani to
repay more than_$60,00_0 because
he gave the women no-show

jobs.

MIAMI (UPI) —— The Federal
Aviation Administration -said a
mistake by an air traffic con-
troller in Miami nearly led to a
collision of a Soviet and a

  A Baby

comes of age

j .

"by Jeffrey Sewald

With his soft, breathy, cockney-
tinged delivery, John Waite could
have stepped right out of an old Bea-
-tles cartoon. The carrot-topped mod

. from the Lakes District of northern
"England, by way of London, speaks

with reverence of his musical influ-
ences, all firmly rooted in the legend-
ary Marquee Club of Soho. Steve
Marriott and The Small Faces. The

A A ~ Fab Four. The Stones. Classic blues

  
 

and soul, not to mention an early pen-
chant for skiffle. The once youthful

I and‘ compelling voice of The Babys
'has stepped into a spiritual phone

booth and reappeared as a vibrant,
emotionally mature rocker -——' John

, Waite, pop mega-star. His dream“

come true?
”Maybe_ this is it,” Waite muses

' quietly. "I don't really go looking for

anything anymore. I don't ask for

' anything. Life is, I keep saying this,” he

adds with a rise in his tone, "life is

" great if you really know how to enjoy

-it..-If you give people things, that's

I j -‘what. it's about.”

With. the skyrocketing success of

  second and latest solo lp, No Brakes,
___ 2 ‘John’ Waite} has‘ certainly earned the
  .'*8l‘? .*°.e"¥°V¢lt*“* his sood fottfmie-i A . 

X ._. . ..  .:._. $3-;; 5.‘-;T,‘_'!" 

  

No. 1 single in "Missing You” and its
chart-climbing follow-up, "Tears,”
have successfully allayed any per-
sonal doubts Waite may have courted
as to his abilities as a‘ solo artist.

As the lead vocalist for the British
power pop group The Babys, Waite
proved his ability to make hit records.
In 1977, a year after the band's
founding in London, they hit big in
America when their single "Isn't It
Time"- bounded to the No. 13 posi-
tion. Initially signed by Chrysalis
Records on the strength of one of the

first video demos, Waite’s kinetic’

enthusiasm and photogenic charm
was definitely a boon for The Babys.

"It was just us leaping around in
front of a video camera. I mean,
nobody would sign us because they
didn't think a band with a name like
that could play. So we just went the
opposite route and showed the band
playing live, and that was it. We got

signed immediately. Up to that point, ’

we couldn't’ get arrested.

"I think it was a kamikaze rock
band, really. I think the name didn't
help at all. But to us it had a sense of
humor. Behind everything we ever

did there was always something that I '
would like to think was a bit tongue- ' ,

around to the people you're doing it
with and they were all _laughing."

But The Babys were exactly that -
babies 4, in an industry sense, and
their youth coupled with their inex-
perience precipitated the kind of life-
‘tyle that, in fantasy, may be the envy
of every adolescent but, in reality, can
only be short-lived.

"We all found each other very nat-
urally and started playing and hang-
ing around London." It ..wasn’t a
contrived, manufactured band. I
think that certain critics put that to
the public and the public believed
what they wanted to. In the end we
just gave up.

"It was hard work, it was. It was

“I was the last person
to make it out of The
Babys. Everybody

ceed too. I ’m the
most dangerous. ”

___.
absolutely wild. There was stuff
going on that even now I can't
believe. I'm still surprised I even sur-
vived it." '
Well, he did and he didn't. The
Babys ultimately proved to be less
than a pleasant experience for Waite.
The period following the band's split-
up in 1981 was a rocky one. Jonathan
Cain left to join the ranks of Journey
early that year and the other Babys
trickled" off into other bands. John‘
was on his own. \
"You see, I was the last person to

make it out of The Babys. Everybody ‘

else made a living but me. Andl think
I was the least likely to succeed, too.

I'm the most dangerous. I have a lot i ‘

more personality. I've always gone
against the grain a bit. I've got a lot of
energy.” ‘ '

John Waite may have been blessed
with a powerfully magnetic personal-
ity, but it was that very intensity that
fueled the dilemma he faced at that
time. , ' ’

"I was completely serious. I went my
own way. -I moved to New York and

"took it from there. I think they were

looking for security and I was looking
for the truth.

"I lived by myself. I did my own
shopping. Did my own laundry.
Walked the streets. Took notes.
Painted. Drew. Learned to play the
guitar better. Wrote good songs or
tried to write good songs. I went really
over the top for a while, but I came
back. I survivedit and I think that's

I ’really going through the fire. I really

went to see who I was  and I found

out." —.
Admittedly, those times were lean.

The ever-painful and emotionally

taxing identity crisis. At 26, John '
‘ Waite was reasonably famous and, by

most people's standards, reasonably
successful. But he wasn't happy. He.

"took time out for himself, the first A
step toward survival in the drag race ,

world of the music industry.

”I disengaged myself from every— "

body and everything. At one time I
even dyed my hair black."

"Why did you do that, John?"

"Why did I do it?"

”Yeah.”

"To disappear.”

Poof. Gone. The year is 1981. Ex-
Baby John Waite roams a stretch of
New York's 72nd Street. Pastthe
Catholic Church‘ of St. John ' The
Martyr. Past Lexington and Park

Avenues, and the skyscraping gran- .

deur, wrought iron and smooth stone

sports dark sunglasses. Headphones.
His collar is turned up to insulate
himself from the world that once
made him a star. Incognito. .

A pedestrian approaches. He looks J

at Waite casually. He continues to
move. They pass each other.

"Hi," John," offers the passerby.

I Poof. He's back again.

"You know, you can't win," says
Waite through a crackly laugh. "I
mean, it's very flattering, but some-
times you can't win.”

Public attention. One of the inevit-
able trappings of fame, and John
Waite openly professes his fondness
toward it. But what of his listening

public, his audience? It is an unmis- ,

takably broad one.

"Well, that's the point, isn't it?
That's the whole point about writing
music.‘ To me. I don't like exclusivity. I
don't like fashion and I don't like hip-
ness and I don't like people who are
just like ‘Later man, I'm too cool.’ I
think music is" for everybody, and if
you can reach somebody in your life,
no matter what age they are, if you
just groove them for like ten seconds,
or if they understand the lyric, you
know, that's the ultimate communi-
cation. That is communication.

"The only people who don't like
music that sells, or music that reaches
people, are people who can't write
that kind of music.”

The possibilities of communication
appear to be foremost in the vision of
the new-and-improved John Waite.
While some 'anti—roma'ntics may hail
his music as one step removed from
aural Tootsie Rolls, none candeny
the stunning success of No Brakes. The
challenge of" making the album was
more than formidable.

When Waite arrived in New York
to begin work on No Brakes, his band
hadgdisintegrated and he was forced

into a reorganization effort. To com- ‘
pound things, the untimely exit of his.
producer forced him behind the mix-

ing board as well. No time to waste.
He had to make it work. There was no

4 one to rely on.

Assembling a top-notch band,

. including L.A. guitarist Gary Myrick

and drummer Curly Smith, for the
first time in his career, John Waite
took on production responsibilities,

assisted by David Thoener and Gary '
Gersh. In addition, he wrote most of '

the album's material. The smash sin-

. gle "Missing You” was written in a

grand total of four minutes.
"It just goes to show that there's no

1 formula for writing a song that has

impact. I think it was so honest, for

_ me. It just sort of came out the back of

my head. I don't feel like Iwas slaving

' , away in a garret writingjt, althoughl‘
was under an enormous amount of

pressure at the time."
A Maybe _an anxiety attack is the
spark that John needed. His inspira-

tion has ‘always come from his per- g
sonal life. Though much of the V

album's material is angst-ridden
("Missing You," "Tears," "Dark Side
of the Sun," etc.), a rich sense of hope,
romance and genuine kindhearted-
ness permeates‘ the pain.

Three years gone/ You're still alone and I'm
still lonely/ And I would give anything/ To

feel my heart beat again/ I wouldn't say that A
« I've been losing time/ But I've been dreaming/

And I'd give up anything/ To keep you as my

_ friend _ ,'

— "Restless Heart”
by John Waite

"The moment I finished writing
‘Missing You,’ I knew it was going .to

be a hit. But I think I was the-.only .

person who had that confidence in it.
People very close’ to home told me it

wasn't very good. A lot of people. And '

Trial by water

The River avoids making a hero of
Tom Garvey as much as it-refuses to
vilify Wade. In Garve‘y's stubborn
determination to conquer nature and
progress single—handedly, he
exhausts and abuses his wife and
children. Again, scrupulous care has

been taken to remove the story from
the preachy realm of allegory.

. This character complexity pulls the '
film from the abyss of a sentimental

morality play. By strivingfor realism
over metaphor, the creators of The
River make their moral lesson more

credible. ' -

Elvis" at 50

  Long live the King

ROCKER
Elvis Presley
RCA

Although contemporary
readings of Elvis Presley are fre-
quently clouded by visions of his
bloated, star-tripping final
years, there is no underestimat-
ing the impact of the man who
came from the backwoods of
Mississippi with his own inimi-.

Vtable presence to create some-
thing boldly exciting and-

limitless in its possibilities.

By melding together ele-
ments of country, gospel,
rhythm and blues, and rock 'n’
roll Elvis created a far-ranging
audience that cut across pre-
vious boundaries. Although
Elvis Presley certainly didn't
invent rock 'n’ roll, he did make
it accessible to more people than
had previously been imagined.

In commemoration of Pres-
ley.'s 50th birthday, RC_A has
released a new compilation of
Presley material and a collection
of six original recordings that
bear listening to. Rocker, the new
addition, is a devastating testi-

é jﬁvefeﬁjjw-Tem-

 

monial. The songs are primarily
from 1956, the year of Presley's
first two records — which
seems a little constricting — but
the music is no less vital.

More worthwhile for those
seriously interested in the ori-
gins of rock 'n’ roll are the early
rec/ordings, digitally remastered
and offered as an exact replica of
the originals (jacket photos,
liner notes, song sequences).

All are powerful, not only as
proof of the havoc Presley's
music originally created but of
his impressive staying power.
Whether crooning the blues,
growling out rock 'n’ roll or
offering up some tender gospel,
Presley gives ample evidence of
why he was truly the man who
would be King.

Although it's easy to be skep-
tical about a record company's
motivation with a marketing
ploy such as this, the bottom
line is that it doesn't matter —
these recordings are important to
anyone fascinated by rock 'n’
roll. '

DANNY ELFMAN
So-Lo
MCA

Danny Elfman, knownprima-
rily as the singer and songwriter
for Oingo Boingo, has with this
his first solo album (approp-
riately title So-Lo), become the
pop music equivalent to t-he
Dead Kennedys' Jello Biafra.

'. This album“ illustrates clearly

Elfman's frustration and dis-
gust over what he sees as a
trend in American culture: style
taking precedence over
substance.-

The funny thing about this

. record is that it seems to be an
. attempt on Elfman’s part at

covert action. So-Lo is nine songs
with slick, almost top fortyish
music sugarcoating lyrics that
have nothing but contempt for
everything this MTV-
mesmerized society’ stands for.
The important thing about the
record is that it's revealing,
insightful and very intelligently
put together.

Although So-Lo has a philoso-
phical continuity to it, it also dis-
plays a variety of musical forms
including funk, regggae,
straight pop and some maniac,
fast paced stuff reminicent of
Oingo Boingo. Most of the
instrumentation is synthesized

.. p and well done, wothout coming
' - off as cold and flat as synthes-
/

ized sound often does.
As far as individual songs go

  their are no real weak ones but
_ '  some are particularly interest-
" 1; .:;.f ing. ”Cool City,” for instance,

" '3. brings us to a place wherea soul

 

is a small price to pay for an

pf additional rung on the social
 ladder.‘ A plac_e_ where "All the‘

girls want t_o_be in movies and
go out with each

other.”

"It Only Makes Me Laugh,"

(which would probably be the

best single, is the most frus-
trated song on the album. It
seems that Elfman has come to
the realization that current
trends may never reverse, and
that perhaps things don't neces-
sarily have to get better.

In addition to these there are
two good and equally depress-
ing love songs,”The Last Time"
and "Go Away” as well as a good
parody of the Mr. Macho who
we all know so well: "Tough as‘
Nails.”

Overall this will probably /
prove to be one of the best and
most interesting pop recordings
of the year. And for those of you
who find little but misery in
these years of yuppiedom
Danny Elfman will make great
company.

I OI-‘TEN DREAM OF TRAINS
Robyn Hitchcock
Midnight Music

Every once in a great while, if
you're lucky, someone will pass
an obscure album your way of
such noteworthiness that you
feel compelled to send up a sig-
nal flare to the mass public. I
Often Dream of Trains deserves all
the word of mouth success it
receives. '_ A

A d_i_verse collection of 14
tracks, this solo album from ex-
Soft Boys front man Robyn
Hitchcock moves briskly
through a string of captivating,
fresh musical treatments, rein-
stituting the acoustic guitar and

piano as rock 'n’ roll focal points. —

No drums. No. synthesizers.

tentious and relaxed, like the
work of an artist who / is so
secure with his abilities that he
refuses to waste time groping
for an elusive pop "hook."

. Beginning 'with"’Nocturne," a
soft piano‘ prelude that could be
the opening theme for any love
story as well as for this album,
and continuing through the
raucous, hollow sound of "I
Wish I Was A Pretty Girl,” the
album establishes a personality

of its own, a wholly original fla- .
vor. "Uncorrected Personality-

Traits," a whimsical three-part
' harmony a capella number, con-

"veys a rich sense of irreverent

humor backed with the odd psy-

chological overtone that charac-
terizes most of the record.

Morbid quips dealt out with wit

and playfulljest give the album‘
its unusualcharm. _' .

"Heartfull of Leaves,” a full-
bodied instrumental guitar
piece, summons up memories of
the Beatles’ Abbey Road — slight
hiss in the recording, imperfec-
tion, leaving all of the slickness
to the performer rather than
the technician. _

Definitely absent is the raw
sound that characterized the
Soft Boys. This album is a thing
apart — easy to listen to, funny,
at times crudely simple but,
moreover, an artist being him-
self. A rare find.

core offerings: We've Come for
Your Beer by the Fiends.

The Fiends (since I last heard
them) have changed from a
band whose music was angry
and barely above average to a
band whose music.is wild, pow-
erful and hard to pin down.
This, their first full-length
album, is at all times’ demented

and more often than not

extremely funny._
The music itself is some com-

,bination of ‘thrash, heavy metal

and basic rock 'n’ roll with some
tasteless background noises and
sound effects thrown in for
good measure. It's about as close

to pure anarchy as you'll hear on 0 -

any record. T

The title of the first track,
"Riot in the Men's Room," is
about the, only way to describe
what it sounds like, and yes, it
comes complete with all of your
favorite men's room noises.

We've Come for Your Beer also
includes some good parodies,
like a cover version of the old
standard "Ramblin'.Rose" that
ultimately does the song a great
justice and the extremely sar-
castic (at least I hope so) heavy
metal mockery, "Battle Axe."

The highlight of this record, _

however, is the Fiends',tribute
to Bob ”he’s a'funny guy" Hope
titled what else but "Die Bob '
Die." _

And, as if that weren't
enough, their album has an
afterwards of sorts enthusiasti-
cally provided by the Brady
Bunch. V

Although this record proba-
bly won't change the way you
think about music, it will make
you laugh, and that in itself
offers a lot more than most’

and say, 'Well, if you don't like it,
don't listen to it.’ So it's made me a lot

like 'I fucking told you so’ kind of

Another way of reaching people

way of video, a format that John does

YESTERDAY: THE BEATLES
1963-1965

Robert Freeman

Holt, Rinehart and Winston

Considering the profusion of
Beatles memorabilia and spicy
rarities that have inundated the
marketplace in recent years,
wise and steadfast Beatlemani-
acs have learned to keep a tight
grip on their billfolds. Well, ease
up fans because you may want
to pull coin for this one.

Photographer Robert Free-
man's collection of rare Beatle
photos is not the product of
some opportunistic paparazlzi,
but the work of a sensitive artist
with whom the Beatles them-
selves, at first skeptical, became
friends and mutual admirers.

Throughout, the photo-
graphs capture much of the
warmth and innocence of those
early years when faces were
smooth and eyes not yet har-
dened by the cynicism and con-
fusion that would characterize
their later years as music's
superforce. Best known for the
austerity of the Meet The Beatles
album jacket, Freeman's work
also found its way onto four
other Beatle covers; A Hard
Day's Night, Beatles For Sale, Help!
and the trend setting photo dis-

A tortion of Rubber Soul. '

The collection catches the
band at choice moments with
sometimes artistically grainy
portraits and sometimes
sharply focused shots that

" appear to demonstrate the com-

plexities and incongruities of
the band as a team as well as
that of four distinct individuals:
the playful yet pensive nature of
John, the serious musicianship
and childlike enthusiasm of
Paul, the quiet yet witty dis-
tance of George and the clow-

nish moodiness of Ringo.

McCartney offers in the pre-
face ”I have a feeling that
Robert Freeman's photos were
amongst the best ever taken of
the Beatles.” Impeccably profes-
sional and still compassionate,
they may very well be.

HAIRCUT AND OTHER
STORIES

Ring W. Lardner

Vintage

As a young student Ernest
Hemingway signed his high
school writings as ”Ring W.
Lardner, Jr.” Such was once the
reverie of Ring Lardner.

From reading these stories,

I one can easily imagine a 1920s’

reader enjoying these wonder-
fully simple vignettes on the
peculiarities of American life.
Easily enjoyable on its breezy
surface, Haircut and Other Stories is
the finest collection of humorist
works — written at that time —
since Mark Twain last delighted
readers.

Unfortunately, like Twain,
Lardner’s world view became
more and more pessimistic as he

neared the end of his life. Unlike

Twain, Lardner brought about
his death at a young age, the
result of chronic alchoholism.
Haircut is a strong statement of
Lardner’s powers before his
artistic vision grew dark.

”The Golden Honeymoon” is
a husband's recollection of his
50th anniversary trip to Florida
and takes the reader on a mental
vacation that is consumed by
Charlie's charming recollec-
tions, which are brought to an
end by his wife's return.

”Haircut" and "Alibi Ike"
offer Lardner at his greatest
height, ingeniously presenting
everyday language as farce and
portraying comical scenes of
human bravado. ”I-Iaircut” fea-
tures another frequent theme
in Lardner’s work —— humor as a
sinister force.

”Champion," a jolting story
about the power aggression
holds, has Lardner wickedly
satirizing the brutality and sav-
agery of boxing. Its black humor
will promote only disturbed
laughter.

Haircut and Other Stories is "an

‘outstanding collection of short

stories from a forgotten man in
American literature. Do your-
self a favor -— remind yourself.

’85 Season! Fazio Hires New Coaches

By Jim Urban and
Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News

The dust has finally begun to set-
tle following Coach Foge Fazio’s
housecleaning of the Pitt coaching
staff. On Wednesday, Fazio
announced that he has hired two
coaches, Trent Walters and John
Montgomery, to coach the defensive
backs and tight ends, respectively. '

The picture has cleared a bit, but
not all is taken care of.

Joe Moore, a first-rate line coach
who has sent seven starting linemen
to the NFL in the last three years,

lcers to Tackle Tartans

big loss," stated defenseman Damon
Brown. “If it's a close game, you can
look for the defense’s putting the
winning goal in. Usually, when it’s
close, one of the defensemen gets the
key goal.” ’

“Their [CMU’s] coach is really
good," saidtright wing Jim Owens,
Jr. “He’s probably the best coachein
the league.” CMU’s coach is also the
father of Panther right wing Roger
“The -Dodger” Oldaker.

“It’s going to be a real intense
game for me,” said Roger, who sar-

castically added, “It’s not going to be

any fun living with him if we lose and
vice versa if we win. My father
mumbled something about them
[CMU] being better this term, but I
was watching ‘The Honeymooners,’
so I didn’t pay much attention to
him.”

No team is without its weakness-
es, and the Panther Hockey Club is

certainly no exception. “We still,
I have trouble breaking out of our

own end without the puck getting

stolen," confessed co-captain Jim =

Lang. “But we have about eight or
nine legitimate goal scoring threats.
Theother team can't be concerned
with just one player because there
are a lot of people who can get the
puck in the net. Unfortunately, the
probability of putting the puck in
the net depends greatly on the ability
of the opponent's goalie to stop the
shots." .

“Their [CMU's] goalie is huge.
He’s about 7-4,” expressed Owens.
But‘ is he good? “He’s so big he
doesn't have to be. Even when he's
kneeling in the net he's tall enough to
block all the shots.”

Right wing Kurt Stetzer has been
unable to skate for the Panthers
since the beginning ofthe season due
to a hip injury, but he’ll be back on
the ice tomorrow to help in the battle
against CMU. “I’m really looking
forward to it," said Stetzer. “It really
eats on youjust sitting in the stands.
The main thing I'm going to have to
work on is getting my timing back.
Othei than that, I don't see any
problems.” Except for a scrimmage
game last night, this will be the first
time Stetzer has been on'skates since
November. I V

“Kurt will be a good addition to
the team. It will give us another
tough right winger," said Owens.

Tomorrow’s game is" at 2:30 p.m.,
and the team will start preparing for
their next match, which is at
Wheeling.

has been_relieved of his two-year
offensive coordinator position.

“Joe and I have been together for
nine years,” Fazio said. “Despite
what everyone thinks, Joe and I
don't look at it as a demotion.
There's no pay cut and he's not being
blamed. It was something we talked
about for a while. It’s more difficult
to be offensive coordinator and
offensive line coach, especially on
game day: blocking schemes and
things of that nature. So this will
relieve Joe a little bit.”

Fazio said yesterday he will name
Moore’s replacement by Feb. 15 —
national letter of intent day. The
move has fueled speculation that
Wally English may be returning to

revive a suspect offense.

Stemming from a telephone con-
versation after English’s firing from
Tulane late last year,‘Fazio said he
isn't even considering English’s
return_to offensive coordinator, a

spot he held under former Pitt coach ,

Jackie Sherrill in l979-80 when Dan
Marino, Julius Dawkins and Bryan
Thomas began etching their names
in Panthers record books. .

“I never offered him the position,”
Fazio continued. “After he was let
go, we talked at length about differ-
ent things but never anything about
[offensive coordinator]."

Walters replaces former defensive
secondary coach Dino Folino, still
undecided on a position Fazio

offered him within the. football.”

Walters, 42, was special teams
coach for the Cincinnati Bengals last
year after serving under University
of Washington's Don James for
three years. The Indiana University
graduate also served as secondary
coach for the Hoosiers for nine

" years.

Afterdismissing line coach Don

Thompson along with former assis-. I

tants Carmen Grosso and Kent

with only three defensive assistants." I

Swimmers Host Penn

' By Mary Daigle

The Pitt News

The Lady Panther swim team
plans on a fight to the finish as they
match up with rival Penn State this
Saturday at l‘p.m. at Trees Pool.

The team is coming off a success-
ful and rigorous winter training ses-
sion in Puerto Rico. Team coach
David Belowich described the l0-
day session as being the best he has
seen in four years of coaching. “They
worked out with much intensity," he
said. “They swam 100,000 meters in
10 days.

“That sets up the rest of the season
as far as fitness is concerned," Belo-
wich continued. “People are further

along physiologically in comparison v

with the last several years."
According to sophomore Jodi
O'Neil, everyone swam very hard
and very well. “That sets us up for
the rest of the season," she said.
Although the workouts in Puerto
Rico were rigorous, assistant coach

Sandy Bizal said that the intensity of

the meet makes you forget about
being tired. “A lot of it has to do with
your head," she said. “If you think
you can do it, that's halfthe battle."
Bizal, who was a four-time All-
America at Penn State, affirmed
that her loyalties lay with ‘Pitt.
“Most of the girls I swam with at
Penn State have left," she said.
“Besides that, when I made my deci-
sion to come to Pitt, my attitude
changed from day one. I'm behind
these guys all the way.“ ’

According to Belowich, this meet
should prove to be one of the closest
meets yet this season. “It's‘a very
close meet. on paper," he said. “It

'* could very easily go down to the last

relay.” '

Since both teams are coming off
very strenuous _winter break work-
outs, Belowich is not looking to
break any records at this dual meet.

, “Neither team is considered a favor-

ite in any event. They will.be very
close races.” I

The two teams‘ most recent com-
petition was Nov. 30 at the Penn
State relays. Penn State and Virgin-
ia tied for first place in the meet,
while Pitt claimed third.

Saturday's meet should be a clas-
sic match-up, according to Belo-
wich. Penn State, 6-l, is the
two-time Eastern Champion and
Pitt, 4-0, is the two-time Big East

- Champion. Penn State is currently"
ranked second in the East and Pitt is I

fourth.

Freshman Cindy Rose compares
the rivalry to the Pitt vs. Penn State
football rivalry. “lt‘ll be tough all the
way," Rose said.

Senior Sue Heon added. “If the
Pitt football team can beat P.S.U.-,
so can the Pitt swim team.“ .

Junior Wendy Morgan believes
the first event will set the pace for the
rest of the meet. “The medley relay
could set off the meet.“ she said.
“Then we'd just have to stickto the
rest ofthe meet. But winning the first
event is important for your frame of

‘ mind.“

The diving competition will be
just as close as the swimming.

Both Penn State and Pitt claimed

one first place and one second place, 2,

at the Penn State relays. .
Krug assessed both teams as bein
strong,

excellent divers, led by senior Mary

Ellen Clark. ‘Although he granted» ‘I
that P.S.U. had more depth, Krug ‘.

said that the meet could go either

way. “For three or four years, Clark,

has been one of the best divers in the

‘East. As a senior, she isn't getting .
any worse," said Krug. “Our divers .

are in good condition; they trained
well over break. The meet being held-

at Trees Pool is going to beneﬁt

them too."

Sophomore Tricia Ney should be i.

one of the leaders for the Lady

Panthers, according to Krug. “Ney "
never misses a workout; she is very I

dedicated." he said. “She wants to be ' 
the best and is willing to work hard; 5.

and sacriﬁce to get there." '

Other top divers for the Lady,“-I
Panthers are juniors Jennifer Brown’ g:

and Tricia Shultz.

Having participated in the Penn’ ‘

State relays will give the team the
extra conﬁdence and, experience.-
“We still have a relatively young
team — mostly sophomores and
juniors. so experience is helpful."-
said Belowich. .
“If we swim to the best of ‘our
abilities.Iwe can win," said Heon.

According to Rose. “We haveto .
keep our conﬁdence level up and if .
we should make mistakes. we can‘! . ’
get down on ourselves. We have to .

pick rightup an go on."

Roy Chipman reads calendars
like librarians at book return coun-
ters — one day at a time.

Followers of his basketball team
(9-2, 1-0) prove a more conventional
breed, blatantly disregarding certain
numbered days on the January grid.

In a 16-day period beginning
Monday, five games loom against
teams occupying the Big East's
upper echelon. Yes, but aren't we
forgetting something, Chipman
wonders? Like Connecticut tomor-
row night? Only the Panthers’

,second road game in 12 outings?
Against a 4-7 team who is 0-3 in the
conference?

Unconventionally, only Chipman
remembers. “The most ‘important
game as far as I’m concerned is Sat-
urday," he mentioned yesterday.
“UConn has played some tough
teams and played them well. I think
they’ve had a letdown.”

Already this year, the Huskies
have lost to Minnesota by a point,
squandered a halftime lead against

St. John's and lost two nights ago to

Providence 75-66.

“At this point, people expect after
a loss at Providence that we should
beat them at Storrs," Chipman
added. “It‘s easier to beat them at
Hartford than Storrs. I don’t think
Storrs [Field House: 4,660] is the
best place for your first conference
game on the road. I prefer the [Prov-
idence] Civic Center or the Palestra.

Fans there aren't on you as much.” -

Tim Tolokan will take exception.
“It’s one of the biggest misconcep-
tions in the Big East,” the UConn
sports info director said. “Fans at
Pittsburgh are closer on the sidelines
than at Storrs. The only stands that
are even remotely close are the end
zones, and that’s like high school,
with five rows.”

It’s OK, though, because school’s
out until Jan. 21 — vacation shooing
students away — and UConn coach

Dom Perno continues to search for a .

starting lineup like a ’49er in gold
country. Already he’s seen forward
Eddie Williams break a bone in his
shooting (right) hand, limiting him
to nine points and 3.8 rebounds per
‘game. Add to that center Tim Coles’

' strained knee and you've got a win-

less team in conference play.

“The problem is we play well
enough, but not down to the wire,”
Perno said yesterday. “We can’t pull
together 40 minutes. That’s been our
problem all year. If we can put

1'

Two in a row? UConn next for Panthers

together a full game, as all coaches
strive to do ...” I
The Panthers, seemingly, illus-
- trate the flipside of Perno’s predica-
ments. Though only shooting 47.4
from the field, they outscore oppo-
nents by a 14.5 average. And, to
Chipman’s surprise, freshman Cha-
rles Smith leads in scoring(l2.4) and
rebounding (7.3). “Just goes to show
you what a fine, all-around player he
is,” said the pleased coach.
Similarly’, Perno has found solace
in his top player, Earl Kelley, ajun-
ior whose ankles last year spoiled a
rocketing start as a freshman. Those
two years were spent at shooting
guard, from where he’s moved now

to the point. The ankles are doing —

fine in transition as his 13.6 average
and 52.5 field goal percentage
reveals.

“He’s, I think, making a good
adjustment,” Perno said. “Usually,
you make a changelike that and it
takes a while. But he has the right
attitude.”

Kelley’s counterpart, sophomore
Curtis Aiken, will lead Pitt’s ground
as has been his wont this year. The
assists (52) and steals (23) leader is
second on the team in scoring(l0.8),
teaming nicely in the backcourt with

4 freshman Demetreus Gore. The

Motorman has led Pitt in scoring
three times with a 10 ppg average.

Philly ‘Flyers’

By Teresa Varley
For The Pitt News

Young and talented. Those
two words provide a perfect de-
scription for the University of
Pittsburgh track team. The
squad is made up of underclass—
men with the ability to make the
Panthers real winners.

Two of those young and tal-
ented Pitt runners are Rogers
Thomas and Alan Laws, both of
Philadelphia. -.

Thomas, a freshman, is mak-
ing early contributions to the
team. In a recent Pitt develop-
mental meet he qualified for the
IC4A championships, March 2
at Princeton, in the 50-yard dash
with a time of 5.3. He also set a
Fitzgerald Field House record in
the 300-meter run with a time of
34.4. Thomas is expected to con-
tinue to be a fine performer.

“Rogers should turn out to be
a very good sprinter,” said Pitt
coach John Vasvary. “He is
going to be a real asset. He is a
very smooth runner. He isinot
one of the most powerful ones,

‘i but more of the gliding type. He
looks as if he is never touching
the ground.” _ '

Thomas, a pre-engineering
major, came to Pitt for various
reasons. “I just wanted to come
to the University of Pittsburgh,”
Thomas said. “I wanted to
pursue my education and track
ability."

Thomas has . been running
track competitively since tenth
grade, but he actually got inter-
ested in track before that.

“It was my mother who
encouraged me to run track,"
‘Thomas explained. “She would
have me run to the store for her
and she would time me to see
how fast I could get back. That’s
how I got started.”

A graduate of Simon Gratz
High School, Thomas earned
three letters in track, one in cross ‘

country and one in soccer. He
knows what it takes to be able to
succeed in sports. “You have to
hang in there," Thomas said.
“You can't give up.” '

Laws, a sophomore, also qual-
ified for the IC4A's in the 4x800
meter relay at the George Mason ’
Invitational. ’ ‘

Lonely at the top for Miller

By Jace Palmer
The Pitt News

It can be said that only great ath-
letes reach their ultimate potential,
many times becoming figures in the
public eye. In carrying on Pitt's tra-
dition of athletic excellence, athletes
such as Roger Kingdom, Bill Fralic
and Clyde Vaughn have proven that
in most cases this is true. However,
the case of senior gymnast Ed Miller
shows that there is an exception to
every rule. Said gymnastic coach
Frank D’Amico, “Ed has been a
great athlete to coach because of his
leadership, although it’s been tough

for him to handle the lack of public- -

ity and recognition sometimes given
to other gymnasts."

Although strong on rings and
superb on the high bar, a shoulder
injury he received his freshman year
has inhibited his performance here
at Pitt. “It gets bad, sometimes keep-
ing me up at night,” Miller said.
“Last year I performed on rings at
the meets but didn't practice on
them because of the pain.”

Nonetheless, “Steady Eddy”‘has
emerged as one of Pitt’s most de-
pendable gymnasts in the past four
years. D’Amico replies, “I can’t say
enough about him. He’s been our
most consistent gymnast although
it’s been tough for him to reach his
potential because of his shoulder
problems. We have to work him
hard, then let up, according to how
he feels. His shoulders prohibit him
from extending his ability and
potential as a possible All-East
performer.”

Philly ‘Flyers’
continued from page sixteen

“Alan is one of the team lead-
ers,” Vasvary said. “He runs
things that demand respect. He is"
a real factor on the team. I feel
that he can be outstanding. He
has good speed and a great deal
of strength.” ~

Laws, a graduate of West Phil-
adelphia High School, earned
track All-America honors in
high school. At Pitt, he has
earned one letter in ‘track and
was a member of the Pitt dis-
tance medley relay time that was
ranked third in the world
indoors.

He came to Pitt, he says,
because “I trusted Coach Vas-
vary and [assistant coach] Lewis. '
They seemed secure.” Laws, who
is majoring in marketing, credits
his strong religious belief for his
success. “God has given me the
strength to run and win,” Laws

A said. “Trusting in God has really
helped me.”

Both of these athletes should
continue to bring success to the
Pitt track program and help
them become contenders for the
Big East title.

“Its like the story of the

ten little Indians now
there’s only one.”
Ed Miller

Miller's initial interest in gymnas-
tics occurred his freshman year of
high school in McMurray, Pa. He
said, “I really wanted to join the
wrestling team, but my mom said it
was too dangerous. So I decided to
try gymnastics, which is, in many
ways, more dangerous." Although
his team took second in the state

when he was a sophomore, the coach .

left before his junior year. “We more
or less had to coach ourselvesafter
that, although a football coach
worked with us.”

As a senior in high school, Miller
decided he wanted to attend a school
that had a good reputation in both
the engineering program and the
gymnastics team. “I was accepted to
a lot of schools, but Pitt has every-
thing I wanted,” he said, although
many factors helped his decision-
making. . ’

Because of his senior status,

PANHEL/IFC DANCE:

Miller takes pride in being the only
upperclassman on the men's squad,
considering there were other fresh-
man "gymnasts during his first year.
“It’s like the story of the 10 little
Indians —— now there's only one."

An electrical engineering major,
Miller finds it challenging to be
involved in gymnastics. “It’s tough,”
he said, “but it definitely keeps me
busy when I have to keep up with the

studies and team practice." Looking .

back, Miller feels his most memora-
ble experiences involved the inter-
national meets here at Pitt. “The
Russians stand out most in my mind
because it was different seeing these
athletes from another country, espe-

cially since we are sort of rivals with .

their country.”

As a departing senior, Miller
reﬂected over his past years with

_ Coach D‘Amico and the team. He

said of hisvcoach, “Frank has helped
me a lot through the years, especially
with his knowledge of technique.”

When asked about this year’s
team, Miller saw the squad’s great
potential, but added that in order to
reach it they must get themselves
together as a unit. “If we bring our-
selves around,” he said, “this team
can definitely become the sleeping
giant of the Big East.".

  The New Year:

By Jim Brueckner
The Pitt News

New Year's resolutions are all a
‘big joke. I can imagine ifthey could
produce statistics on how many are
kept. The universal percentage
would probably fall between one
and two percent. With that in mind,
let us gaze into an imaginary crystal
ball and read the minds of some of

' the sports world's finest.

Suddenly, the Fitzgerald Field
House comes into focus.

Coach Roy Chipman —— “I resolve
to build the Panthers into a Big East
contender within the next two years.
That’ll give Patrick Ewing time to
clear out." The latter will certainly
help the former. .

Charles Smith — ‘‘I resolve to
help Coach Chipman in his ascent to

the top of the Big East.---As, for Mr._

Ewing, I may not be at his level, but
if he gets too cocky I'll put him in his
place." I wonder how Mr. All-World

Opinion

Shotblocker would like a freshman
to return the favor.

Demetreus Gore,-— “I resolve to
perform well enough so that my abil-
ities get more headlines than my
name.” Gore and others have shown
promise for the future.

Keith Armstrong — “I resolve to
quiet the critics who say that Pitt is
weak inside." An off-season weight
training program may have done the
trick.

Curtis Aiken — “I resolve to
remind the fans that Charles Smith
and Demetreus Gore aren't the only
High School All-Americas on this
team.” I can’t wait to see these three
in two years. Look out Hoyas!

Wait! A mist is engulfing the crys-

tal ball. Suddenly, Pitt Stadium .

Promises, promises

Foge Fazio —— “I resolve to prove
the decision (to retain him) a worthy
one.“ Remember, another coach in
this city did not exactly set the NFL
on fire in his early years.

John Congemi — “I resolve to
return to the form of my sophomore
season.” Entering the season with an
experienced supporting cast and
without injuries are the two keys.

Craig “Ironhead” Heyward —— “I

resolve to return the Panther land

forces to the glory days of the Dor-
sett era.” Despite the- loss of Bill
Fralic, look for another 1,000+ yard
season by a Panther running back.
Bill Callahan —— “I resolve to
make an appearance on Bob Hope’s
Christmas special this year (along
with the rest of the AP All-America
team)." If the awards are presented
as deserved, he will make that
appearance. -

‘ Bill Fralic — “I resolve to reac

the same status as a former team-

mate of mine. You know,it_,hat quar- _ _

terback with the curly hair who
hangs out at the beach.” Something
tells me he will. But who’s that
quarterback?

Joe Paterno — “I resolve to give
the Panthers more competition this
year.” Be prepared, he will.

Now let us take a trip around the
country and look in on the nation’s
elite. Let’s start with a few alumni.

Dan Marino —~ “I resolve to make
the University of Pittsburgh the
alma mater of the NFL’s greatest
quarterback.” Dolphins 38-34. I had
to throw that in somehow.

Tony Dorsett — “I resolve to
show everyone that Dan Marine is
not the only All—Pro from Pitt.”
Then tell Tom Landry to make his
offense fit his players. A certain
coach named Shula tried it, and
where will he be on Super Bowl
Sunday? ’

Doug Flutie — “I resolve to rekin-
dle memories of Fran Tarkenton.”I
think it’s interesting that a 5-10

B quarterback can hold many all-time

passing records, but a quarterback
who is a mere one-quarter of an inch
shorter “can’t make it.”
Muhammad Ali —- “I resolve to
come back unless it’s against Cosell!
I’m still pretty and I’d like to keep it

that way!” In case you have not

heard, Ali’s speech problems were
caused by a treatable disease, not
brain damage. He'll always be the
Champ in my book. ’

Bill Murray — Bill Murray? How
did he show up? Well, he did name
his first son after Chicago Cub
shortstop Ernie Banks. ‘‘I resolve
not to name any more of my kids
after Cubs superstars. Can you
imagine Ryne [Sandberg] Murray?
I’ve got other ideas. I was recently in
Pittsburgh at the Civic Arena trying
to acquire some culture. ‘I was
watching some professional wrest-
ling. I heard these guys talking about
this basketball player named Deme-
treus Gore. Now there’s a name.”

Well, that's all the resolutions
until next year. ‘Remember, never
make a resolution that you plan on
keeping. After all, why break
tradition?
