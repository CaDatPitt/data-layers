--why busing?" was the sub-

ject ofa noontime /debate Wed-
nesday. as part of fhe program-
ming by the yB1ack’Action‘ So-
ciety for Black Week.

Reginald. Dockens Sevayega.
assistant professor of Black Stud-
ies. defended the negative stance.
while Steven Rosen. associate pro-
fessor of Political Science at

Brandeis University and ‘former

 

   
  

Reginald Sevayega, assistant pro-'
fessor of Black Studies at Pitt.

assistant professor at Pitt. took the
affirmative. . _

The capacity audience in the
ballroom might have been better
prepared had BAS President Al
Wynn’s closing remarks prefaced
the debate.

-He noted that there was "no
hero and no'villain in the de-
bates‘ and "exposure to the is-
sue" was the purpose of the pro-
gram.

Rosen began the debate by out-
lining the history of busing, em-
phasizing that busing was a Vf,€_stra'-_
.tegy of moving black children

Sevayega, Rosen discuss Pros and Cons V

piration levels, greater future
opportunities and the reduction
of racial tension.

Rosen stated several times that
“If, the benefit to blacks are as
great as the inodel—busing would
be worth it in terms of costs to
the black community."

Sevayega began his presenta-
tion with the statement that "the
issue is a pseudo-issue. You can-
not deliberate over what you have
no control.”

Emphasizing that integration
was “fostered by whites with the
help of the National Association
for ‘Colored’ People”, Sevayega
stated the black answer for inte-
gration was that it was demean-
ing “because you get into ratios,
which are in themselves demean-
ing.”

Sevayega explained. "what
happens in white schools is that
you learn about George Was ing-
ton. the racist. father of our coun-
try."

"You learn what it means to be
a white man in America."

Sevayega took his stand from
the philosophical perspective
while Rosen cited statistical con-
clusions.

The debate evolved into a lec-
ture with two viewpoints of one
side presented. While Rosen rare-
ly presented cases for the affir-
mative. he did stay with the sub-
iect of busing.

Sevayega started out with bus-
ing. but moved along to the ‘ﬁde-
meaning racist concept in educa-
tion—the flip side of segregation“.

l

and finally rested on the topic
of black white attitudes. C
Sevayega concluded saying

“the method and ideology of
studies (of integration) are con-
taminated. What white man can

V be objective about a black manin

America? Integration is- not our

— issue—i't’s white folks’ issue.”

Rosen added "fortv three per-

Roseii accused Sevayega of de-
fending his case on the basis of
“black rhetoric”, and Sevayega

Other questions on the ballot,

concerning the value of various

-student organizations and more

student control over administra-
tive affairs have not vet been tab-
ulated.

According to Lynn Zimmerman.
chairwoman of the Student Gov-
ernment Judicial Committee. vic-
tory margin on thefee referen-
dum was one of the highest in the
United States among schools who
have put the question to a stud-
ent vote.

Jennings said that the turnout
was the highest for any student
ballot ever held. The turnout was
approximately double that of the
January Student Government
Election. '

"This campus isn't as apathetic
as people think." Jennings said.

5:30 is awfullv earlv. btit near-
l\ 100 women from Pittsburgh are
waiting to join forces in the “Qual-
it\‘ of Life" caravan. and cover-
age on Harrisburg. The buses
are late. evervone is tired. but
optimism and hope are prevalent
feelings.

We finally pull into the Harris-
burg \’\\'CA about 10:15. The first
press conference is over so the
delegation from l’ittsbiirgh is
asked to go to the second floor
for a briefing. 800 women have
gathered to lobbv against the
Mullen bill which does not allow
abortion even in cases of rape
andincest

Behind the poditiin on ;i darklt
lit stage. a young woman has
sent the earlier group over to the
state capitol building to begin
talking with senators. She tells
us that we have more knowledge
abotit the subiect of abortion than
the senators. explaining how ill
informed thev are. Slieets of sta-
tistics are passed arotind. buttons
and posters handed out. and Li
waifning is made on how to ap-
proach the senators. If they are
alreadv in session. we have to
wait until thev come out for
lunch. or grab them as thev head
for water fountains or the john.

One woman stands up. and dc-
clares. “We should get them in
the iohns. If thev don't respect
our bodies. we won't respect
theirs."

Posters saying—“How do you
tell a 12 year old she has to be
a mother,” “Abortion, the right
to choose”, and “Roman Catho-
lics for the right to choose,” are
carried by a few enthusiastic
women. Jo Ann Evans Gardner,
newly elected to the home rule
commission, is carrying a sign,-
“If men got pregnant, abortion
would be a sacrament.”

About 15 women are jammed

big leather swivel chair and be-

anyone from his office. Questions
are flying at him from every
corner of the room, while he flus-

ters, stating that he will propose

the question of legalizing abortion

the bill. The women and Duffield
seem to be getting along, he
lets the women speak without
interrupting, until he blows it by
calling one of the them “little

set and leaves the room.

Tenure: Bone at Contention
irrAcaclemia's Staid Threat

students and the junior faculty,
and now it has reached explosive
proportions. Chancellor Posvar,
sensing this unrest, appointed a
commission, composed of diverse
members of the academic com-
munity to study Pitt’s system as
compared to that of other large
institutions.

The thirty member committee
has been charged to prepare a
proposal for a newttenure system
by April. Three undergraduates
and two graduate students are
serving on the committee.

But many students and facul-
ty members view the Chancellor’s
move as a delay tactic; for while

‘the proposed solution to the ten-
ure dilemma may conceivably
solve the problem next year. it is
small comfort to the professors
who are being forced to leave the
University now.

Nearly all of the protests cen-
ter around individuals who have
been refused tenure and have

only one year to find-new jobs._

The movement to fight the tenure
system has been largely unsuc-
cessful because the“ protesting
groups are isolated supporters
of individuals in different de-
partments of the various schools"
which compromise Pitt.

To confound matters the ten-
ure systems used in the various
schools differ considerably and
are so complex that it is nearly
impossible to discover where the
responsability lies.

-T Pitt's administrators and senior
faculty still maintain that some

department. She feels that the
strong vote of her colleagues in
favor of tenure was disregarded
by the administration. She be-
lieves the power to evaluate-a
professor's competence and aca-
‘demic excellence should rest with
the department, not with a Facul-
ty committee.

When she- appealed the decision
to the dean, Hellman learned that
an anonymous committee was
meeting to advise the dean on
tenure appointments. Although J.
Schneewind, revealed that he was
a member of this committee, the
other members remain unknown.
The nature of this ad hoc com-

tmitte has been of some concern
to Hellman.

with the lifetime job security.»

The deans refusal of the de-
partment‘s recommendation has
caused some junior faculty mem-
bers to fear that their talents
will not be judged by their peers.
but by some nebulous committee.
Hellman said. She cited an arti-
cle in the 1972 spring issue of the
American Association of Univer-
sity Professors which stated

. the freedom of nontenured
teachers depends . . on . . .
. acting individual-
ly or collectively to assure the
rights of their junior colleagues."

Hellman claims that as econo— ’

mic pressures plague the uni-
versity. it looks for more ways to
cut expenses. Since the language

system of tenure is needed to
maintain high standards in the
and to insure the
careers of valuable faculty mem-
bers. 'l‘hev believe that this is
especially important because Pitt
is a state related institution and
subject to financial Dressure from
the state legislature.

But many members of the aca-
demic community feel that the
system is being misused. so that
it protects some faculty members
who are not worth saving. while
offering an excuse for dismiss-
ing qualified instructors who do
not fit into the mold for tenured
faculty.

It is indeed ironic that some"

of Pitt’s most controversial and
innovative instructors are losing
their positions through the ten-
ure system, the very device creat-
ed to protect them.

At Pitt today an individual

who has served the"University in .

an "acceptable" fashion for the
"prescribed period‘ of time (usu-
ally five years) is guaranteed his
job for life..Once he has received
tenure he may neglect or avoid
teaching. ignore his research and

progress in his field. and exas-

perate his colleagues and stud-
ents.

In most departments associate
and full professors are tenured.
assistant professors are not. The
tenure system as it stands today
makes untenured faculty fair
game for coercion. while placing

position beyond reproach._~

The initial decision usually
is made by the senior faculty. the
candidates colleagues.
mental politics and backstabbing
often play an important part. 'l‘he
final decision is made by the
Provost who bases his decision
on recommendations made by
the deans of the various schools.

‘In the past the departmental
decision was rarely altered, but
recently the several faculty mem-
bers were not granted tenure af-
ter being recommended by the
department. Some- critics of the

administration claim that this is _

the University's way of cutting
costs.

All tenure decisions are sup-
posedly based on three consid-
erations; teaching ability. re-
search and service to the Univer-
sity. Supposedly no candidate
is expected to excel in all three
areas. _

Unfortunately the three quali-
fications are not always given
equal consideration. Some excel-
lent teachers are being lost be-
cause theyare not research or-
iented. while some departments

cause of poor research produc-
tivity.

The solution to the problem
will not be simple. There is little
doubt that the University will re-
tain some type of tenure sys-
tem, and that this system will
provoke awkward situations.

We can only hope that the
revised system will eliminate
some of the inequities. The con-
cept of "publish or perish" must
be eliminated: there is just as
great a need for good teachers as
for excellent researchers.

Students should be given a
voice in all tenure decisions. for
they can best evaluate a teach-
er's_ abilities. Failure to
achieve promotion’ should no
longer mean that a faculty mem-
ber should be fired.

The University must work rap-
idly to examine the present sys-
tem and institute a better one. In
the meantime the decisions con-

. . . . \
cerning individuals who are be-
-ing forced to 1eavewPitt should
be seriously reconsidered;

We hope that these articles
will serve to illuminate the ten-

ure crisis. and lead to an honest

appraisal of the failures of the
present system.

Tenure Still Vital Smith Says

"I think every department should
carefully evaluate teaching and
other activities without empha-
.sizing the importance of re-
search." Dr. Rhoten Smith. the
Provost. told The Pitt News in an
interview concerning tenure.

The Provost believes tenure
still serves two important roles
within the university community.

Tenure protects a faculty mem-

bers academic freedom from both
external and internal‘ threats.
Smith explained, and at the same
time guarantees him job security.‘
Although Smith believes that
“most decisions should be made
at the departmental level." he
asserted that the deans‘ and the
chancellor’s responsibility to
maintain college wide standards
of teaching requires that they
review and sometimes overrule
departmental recommendations.

Citing teaching. -research and
public service as the three cri-
teria for tenure decisions. Smith
noted that some departments
tend to weigh research more hea-
vily than teaching. Stressing the
need to reach a balance between
the two. Smith said “We can and
must evaluate teaching abilities.

Smith explained that tenure de-
cisions are now beingmade more
carefully because the market for
faculty has changed. In the ’50's.
Smith explained, higher educa-
tion was expanding and outstand-
ing faculty were harder to at-
tract and keep.‘ With more Ph.D's
vieing for fewer positions in a
tighter market the university can
enjoy being more selective in
granting tenure. ' -

Although about half of origin-
al faculty appointees eventually
do receive tenure. Smith said all
cannot be tenured because the
university must continually in-
fuse new blood into the faculty

and strive to attract better and ‘

 

better people in everypossible~
field. ’
Shifts in student, enrollment

from department to department
also necessitate shifts in depart-
ment budgets. which may mean
pruning faculty rosters. Smith
said. i T

Defer/ds tenure system.

According to the American As-
sociation of University Profes-
sors tAAUPi. a college or uni-
versity cannot keep a faculty
member indefinitely without be-
ginning a tenure proceeding. If
such proceedings are not started
within seven years. de facto ten-
ur_e is assumed for the faculty
member. -

Smith said Pitt can now hire
associate professors under a 2-
year. probationary contract but
this 2-year period is often not
long enough to allow a depart-
ment or the administration to
evaluate a professor‘s work. Smith
said. He would like to see the
university establish a second pro-

_ bationary contract. thereby allow-

ing twomore years in which to
make an evaluation and ‘reach a’
decision._ T

 

Some faculty members who
have been denied tenure have
objected to being denied the op-
portunity to see and refute con-
fidential opinions that were part
of the basis for an unfavorable
tenure decision. Smith explained
that such confidential information
and opinions were solicited from
experts in the faculty members
area in an effort to evaluate the
candidate. If such information
were not kept confidential. Smith
said. it might be difficult to ob-
tain a frank evaluation of the
faculty member under considera-
tion. Although such letters could
be subpoenaed in court. Smith
said, making them public under-

' . mines the attempt to get a frank

evaluation.

If a faculty member objects to
a tenure decision because of sex-
ual. racial or political discrim-
ination. he or she has the right
to a hearing where he or.she
has the chance to prove that such
discrimination exists.

Smith said he supported the
university’s Affirmative Action
program through which the uni-
versity seeks qualified women to
fill faculty positions. He pointed
out that more women received
tenure last year than ever before.
but stressed that the university
must apply the same high stand-
ards to all applications for tenure.

Tenure Issue Exemplitied in Biol

Three of the most controver-
sial tenure decisions made this
year originated in the Biology
Department. where only one of
four candidates was promoted to
the rank of Associate Professor.
Dr. Elizabeth Arthur. Dr. Calvin
Spector and Dr. Charles Melton
were denied tenure and will be

forced to leave the lUniversity-

next spring.

.' The decisions came as a shock

to most Biology undergraduates
because the three were among
the most active teachers in the
department.

  

DR. ELIZABETH ARTHUR

“Undergraduate
‘ Advising‘ is
no Joke"-

Dr. Elizabeth Arthur request-

ed a one year extension of her

trial period after learning of the
negative decision last spring.
Similar extensions had been grant-
ed the previous yearto three as-
sistant professors. Melton. Spec-

tor and Dr. Harry Corwin. (Cor-I
. win was the only successful can-

didate this year.) ,

The department denied “the ex-
tension, and Arthur proceded with
her appeal to the FAS.

Arthur has been teaching at
Pitt for six years. As head of the
department's advising center she
has met nearly all of the biology
majors. Arthur also has served
on the pre-professional advising
committee (for pre—meds and pre-
dentsi for several years. '

She believes_that the depart-

ment did not consider ‘her teach-
ing and advising abilities. on Mia
par with research in making their
decision. She has published two

three were dropped because they
have not published many papers
in scientific journals. But many

ment.

gy honorary. held meetings to
plot a course of action to reverse
the tenure decisions and keep the
three professors at Pitt.

papers since coming to Pitt. and

expects to have several ready for
publication this year.

' “I think I’m doing a job in ad-
vising that no one else will do
if I leave”, Arthur said. “You
can’t just say, ‘Numberi59l7- do
this, NumberI59l8- do that’, with-
out knowing each student well.”

Arthur was debilitated by a
stroke several years ago and still
walks with a cane. “I don't
know whether people realized just
how sick I was. I tried to keep
it a secret because I didn‘t want
to upset the students." she said.

"I realized that I only had so

_much energy .and I decided to

spend it on my teaching and ad-
vising duties". Arthur remarked.
Apparently her choice in priori-
ties was not compatable with the
goals of the Biology department.

“There is nothing more impor-
tant then turning someone’s head
loose to think, but you can't do
this unless you are willing to
share yourself,” according to Ar-
thur. “I doubt if ‘anyone realizes
the amount of time my advis-
ing takes. Many members of the
department think advising is some
kind of joke.”

"This department is losing the
good undergraduate teachers. and
I find this terribly disturbing."
she continued. “What has this
University decided its priorities
are? It certainly looks like‘under-
graduate teaching is not one of
them.“ L

‘She also wonders if the recent
tenure decisions will affect the
quality of teachers who come to
Pitt in the future. fearing that in-
dividuals honestly concerned
with teaching will stay away
from Pitt because they fear they
will lose their jobs.

If Arthur fails in her appeal
to gain tenure, she hopes to re-
main in the Pittsburgh area as a
teacher. She owns a home in this
area and views the prospect of

moving with understandable dis- .

may.

The honorary had conducted
an opinion poll of undergradu-
ates concerning the teaching abil-
ities of the four candidates and
submitted the results to the Bio-
logy Department’s senior faculty
prior to the decision last spring.
When the outcome of thetenure
decisions became known, it was
apparent that the student poll had
been virtually ignored.

a boycott of all classes taught
by the senior faculty during the

Spector explains that although
it is easy to evaluate research pro-

exacerbated by the immenseness
of the classes.

“When you teach a large class

Spector s_ympathizes with the

Research Career

Ruined

Dr. Charles Melton, the third
Biology’: instructor who has de-
nied tenure. feels that the Uni-
versity has institutedra “revolv-
ing door" policy of faculty ap-
pointments. Melton was recom-
mended for tenure by the senior
faculty of the department, but
the University administration
made a negative decision.

Melton is appealing his case
on the grounds of his departmen-
tal recommendation. Melton
claims that the Dean knows there

is a buyer’s market for instructors, '

and that he wants to take advan-
tage of it.

Melton maintains that the “up
or out“ system utilized at Pitt is
a remnant of the old Germasnic
philosophy of education. He
would be willing to remain at Pitt
in -his present position, Assistant
Professor, btit this is not permit-
ted under the tenure system. ‘

"When you don't get tenure you
have a stigma attached to your
record. and you usually don't

get hired at another prestigious ,

school." he remarked. Melton
feels that the tenure decision has
“wiped out his research career,"
A negative tenure decision is
"more than ego defamation" ac-
cording to Melton. What bothers
him most is "the frustration of
having to stop my research just
when it is going’well—- when I
feel that I can get another grant."

Sexism Charged in Johnson's Tenure Denial

One of Pitt's most controver-
sial tenure decisions is currently
under investigation by the fed-
eral government due to alleged
sex descriminatioii.

Dr. Sharon Johnson of the
Medical School Department of
Biochemistry was denied t.enure
December and has been

“My department chairman told

,me when I was hired that in or-
“ der to attain tenure I would have

to carry out research. publish.
be active in and attain election

to professional societies and
teach competently”, Johnson
said.

“I have done all of these things,
and before my old department
chairman left two years ago he
told me that I would have no
problem in attaining tenure.”
she added. But with the arrival
of a new department head and a
new dynamic teaching program,
she endorses, Johnson
found herself shut out because

. her interests “do not fit into the

long range plans of the depart-

. ment”—goals_ which Dr. Johnson

maintains were never clarified
to her.

Johnson maintains the decision
against her was made without

giving her an opportunity to pre-
sent a case or defend herself.

She claims that her dismissal
was based on the fact that she
was “too chemical.“

\

in her quest to salvage her po-

sition. Johnson has been lun-'
iieled from one committee to an-
other in what she terms "the

enormous. cumbersome academic
administrative bureaucracy with
its diffuseness and lack of dir-
ect autliority. As is often the case.
the original issues give preced-
ence to the procedural run around
and are lost."

But Johnson feels that the prob-
lem goes deeper then a profes-
sional level; she believes that her
sex was factor in her tenure de-
cison.

"My own situation is by no
means unusual". she said. -'‘I am
only a part of a much larger pat-
tern which has been documen-ted
here at Pitt. i.e. women faculty
members seldom get promoted
to the tenure ranks. to positions
where they can be in the deci-
sion making process The
situation has been bad in the
past and it will continue to grow

worse in the future.“

She cited the absurdity of the
Affirmative Action Program ini-
tiated last year to increase the
numbers of minority groups.
women included, in the higher
ranks of the university’. She
maintains that since the begin-
ning of the program. the number
of women on the faculty of the
Medical School has actually
decreased.

Johnson gives the term “aca-
demic pimpmanship” to the sys-
tem under which women who

have earned doctoral degrees of

their own are hired into subpro-
fessional ranks and are" bound
there, doing research under
other professors who are given
credit for their work.

requirement was dropped two years ago. she believes the administra-
tion seems to be concerned with reducing the language departments.
To date,’ Hellman said, Dean Rosenberg has only given her

what she considers weak reasons for the reiection. In a recent letter,
Dean Rosenberg stated that literary scholars outside the university .

were not sufficiently impressed with her work.

Countering this. she said that the literary critic who had recom-
mended to New Xorki University Press that it publish her doctoral
thesis. and who had followed her work in preparing it. had written
that she was "slow” in completing the manuscript. But Hellman at-
tributed the subsequent delay in publication to an editorial change at the
publishers. "I feel the delay in publication of my book is being
used against me." Dr. Hellman said. i ‘

‘Dr. Hellman holds a Ph.D. from the University of Pennsyl-
vania. and has been the recipient of four grants. including a Mellon
grant to teach at Pitt. and another to work in Brussels and Paris.

Dean Rosenberg apparently thought the department could do
better, Dr. Hellman said. She countered that idea by saying, “If
you shop around you can always do better.” She said this attitude

makes you feel like merchandise,” and discolors human relations,
work and responsibility.

Affirmative Action for Women on campus supported Hellman in
her appeal. Dr. Hellman said the dean’s refusal is more surprising
at this time. when the universitys policy is to make efforts to
attract and keep competent women.

Supplementary Insurance

_ Under Investigation

Advertisements for supple-
mentary health insurance for
Medicare beneficiaries are under
continuing investigation by Social
Security Administrators and state
Departments of Insurance.

Many of the varied insurance
plans have been found to be of
no real economic value and haye
advertised in a misleading and
deceiving manner. Potential buy-
ers are cautioned to be on the
alert.

A maior selling point of most
supplemental health
plans is thewpossibilitv of an ex-
tended period of hospitalization-
a period exceeding 60 days.
which is the normal limit of
FULL Medicare coverage.

Based on statistics recently
compiled.‘ the necessity of this
supplemental coverage appears
greatly‘ over-estimated and over-
emphasized.

In 1970. onlv nine of
thousand Medicare patients ad-

"y- mitted to general hospitals had

a stay which exceeded 60‘ days.
Only these nine. would have been
eligible to receive any meaning-
ful supplementfrom the commer-
cial insurance firms.
‘Only one of each thousand
patientswould have been eligible-
Ato receive supplementary bene-
fits for a period which exceeded
90 days. or the benefit period
coyereAd under Medicare. I
Therefore. only nine-tenths of
one percent of the potential
claimants could have used their
supplementary insurance at all.
and only one-tenth of one per-
cent could liave received sub-
stantial coverage as a supple-

 ment to Medicare.

Many. insurance ‘plans
that "long hospital stays" are
common without regard to these

statistics—a practice which is very

insurance - '

each ,

inter

misleading. The average length
of stay in general hospitals by
Medicare patients in 1970 was
onAly 13 days.

some other‘ misleading adver-
tising ploys which are under close
scutiny by Social Security ad-
ministrators and State Depart-
ments of Insurance are:

iii Ads which infer that the
insurer is affiliated with or has
the approval of the U. S. Goy-
ernmentz.

i2i Plans which offer to "till
in. the Medicare gaps" Wlll(.'ll
lead people to believe All non-
iVIedicare-covered expenses will
be paid. but. in actuality. are
not:

t3l Plans which
large supplemental insurance
amounts and infer that these
payments are common. when. in
fact. they are quite uncommon:

emphasize

i4) Ads which use true state-
ments in such a manner as to
make them misleading. such as.
"Medicare covers less than half
the health care‘ expenses of the
aged." with the inference that
the supplementary insurance
covers the other ha.lf:

(5) Ads using hypothetical hos-
pital bills which show rare situ-
ations:

ttii Campaigns using scare
tactics; and ~ '

«A7» Ads which do not explain
'—'benefit period." benefits pay-
able.“ and "expense incurred"
policies. ' ' ~

Although not all insurance
companies employ these or
similar tactics. there are a sign-
nificant number that do. Poten-
tial users should fully under-
stand what benefits they ’ can
receive and what they are pay-
ing for if interested in a ‘supple-
mentary insurance program.

A new organization for persons in all schools of the health
professions is pres/ently‘being organized. It is the Student Health
Coalition, and its initial concerns will be the improvement of
Student Health Services, an investigation of health care in
prisons, increased student involvement in Campus Health Ser-
vices and the orientation of students to health crises.

Undergraduate and graduate students, as-well as Health
profession personnel can become charter members by attend-
ing the first meeting at 7 o'clock Monday, Nov. 20, in room 224,‘
Graduate School of Public Health.

Column and a Half  

by JOHN METCALFE

When word got out that we were to attend Pitt.
inanv of us were showered with intriguing gifts.
They covered a wide range. but tended to include
T-shirts. sweat shirts and beer mugs: without ex-
ception they were decorated with more or less ac-
curate representations of the University emblem.

Some of us who did not receive such gifts
managed to find stores which dealt in such'mer-
cliandise. and boughteour own. Perhaps we were
motivated by a quaint pride in the institution. We
may have feared our friends would think us odd
if we had no such s_vmbolic possessions. What-
ever the’ reasons. and however we acqiired them.
we are nearly unanimous in owning heraldic gar-
ments and drinking utensils.

Even the mostlimited budget includes an oc-
casional coke from the snack shop—and there it is
again, on every paper cup. (The cups can be
reused several times beforeAthey get soggy and
begin to dribble.) Over and over, the blurb about
Truth and Virtue and the name of the University.

The things are so common I took them for
granted. as a natural part of the everyday world.

' and only began thinking the matter over lately.

Why should there be such a profusion of gar-
ments and gadgets glorifying Pitt‘?

A simple desire to demonstrate loyalty cannot
explain the whole phonomenon. It is too showy.
and incompatible with the dignity of the aver-
age undergraduate. In addition. student ‘loyalty
to the University is sowell known as to require
no special display. There must be more to it. and
I inav have discovered it this morning.

I woke up rather late. and uncertain just where
I was. Though the morning was coolAI was not
uncomfortable. for I was wearing my Pitt sweat-
shirt. I was in a chair. and I wondered how I
got there. My Pitt beer mug. glaring at me from
the table told the whole story. silently.

It was afteL nine o’clock, and that fact seem-
ed vaguely urgent. As I mixed instant coffee I
stared at my cup. “Veritas et Virtus”; “University
of Pittsburgh.” It came to me. A ten o’clock class,
and I was far from campus. Fortunately, I was
already dressed (in my Pitt sweatshirt and a pair
of pants with no distinguishing marks) so I gulp-
ed my coffee, hot though it was. Duty had called.

I grabbed a book at random (technical Aterm

for the top of abookcasei and looked for the door.

ters pointed the way. A '\

Some of the high schoolers are

goes back to talking. Some people

over the summer.

Melnik emphasized that Cfiapiiian is embar-
rased by the support his former students are of-
fering. and that he is not involved in their lob-
bving on his behalf.

An interview with Chapman verified this.

Chapman agrees that the tenure system has
treated him unjustly and now he questions the
value of the system. He claims that the tenure
system sreved its function by protecting profes-
sors during the McCarthy era, but he feels that it
serves to cut incentive‘ amoing tenured faculty to-
day. According to Chapman, if a professor be-
comes a poor teacher, falls behind ‘in his field, or
loses contact with hisustudénts nothing can be
done about.

Chapman concedes that despite his disapprov-
al of the system he would have accepted tenure

Chapman feels that. the Chemistry department’s

is hypocritical in light of the dwindling amount
of.research money available. He believes that the
department should channel their energy toward
undergraduate education.

Pitt Theatre to Present

by KEITH SHUSTER

Opening this weekend at the
studio Theatre is a trilogi. of
related one-act plavs written bv
student Waviie Claeren entitled
Work Play and Saturday. l:;ach
one is built around an anxietv-
ridden situation: a iob interview.
a marital disagreement. and a
hold—up. Author-‘director Claeren
sticks closelv to realitv in these-
plavs. iust barelv wavering over
the fantasv line at moments that
are frightening. yet_funn_v.

ipulate the role reversals and
shifts in power balances that mark
all three plavs. Claeren has given
his actors a free rein to experi-
ment with these variables. since
interaction between them will be
a key determinent of the trilogx ‘s
success.

This production is UI1lGU€l\ a

Eliot Shows Voccil Merits

by JULES M. SHEAR
it would be verv easv to ignore
a new album b_v David Elliot.
'1 he album itself is one of a in). r-
iad of albums by unknown siiig-

ers seeking some recognition.
\our local record store swells
with them. The shameof it is

that inside this unassuming rec-
ord jacket there is a first rate
songwriter at work.

The melodies are the beautv of
l:;lliot‘_s songs. At their best. as in
"Dear Marv." thev are something
to relish. The backing throughout
is a perfect compliment to Elliots
voice. which may evoke visions.
of James Tavlor.

It is supplied by people who
have adorned many Elton John
albums; Caleb Quaye on guitar
and piano, Dee Murray on bass,
Nigel Olsson on drums. Though

- three drummers are credited, it

is clearly Olsson doing the fancy
punching on “You Better Move.”

"The Love You Put On Yester-
dav” is lovelv in the wav that
voice and instruments fall into
place. It gives vou the feeling
that the arrangement just could-
nt have been worked out better.

The most important aspect of,
l:.lliot‘s lvrics is that thev don't

get in the wav of the music. Often
iliev are even inildlv pleasant. as
in "Some." the sad storv of a
couple separated bv the harsh
words of friends. Elliot's voice is
particularly tender here and the
result is downright touching.
hobert Kirbv's arranginent is
exactlv appropriate in its use of
strings and horns. _

it is almost inconceivable that
someone can still sing a line as
trite as "Open the door and love
will come in“ with credibilitx.
but Elliot does and it is perhaps
this vocal credibilitv that makes
this album so fetching.

That Taylor-like honesty is very

much there on the softer songs, 5

like “Dear Mary.” The lyrics,

however, are just not strong-

enough to bring across the humor
attempted in “The Invisible Man.”
This is less than two minutes of
the album though and Elliot’s
amiable voice trots you right on
through.

No. this isn't the best debut
album of the vear. but David
Elliot proves here that he is not
iust another songwriter. Sucha
warm voice deserves a better
late than cold record rack oblivion.

The people are totally depend-

Families get food and water from
a nearby town on a monthly basis.
The water on the reservations is
unfit to drink and running water
and electricity are luxuries.

.\'o jobs or iob training of am
kind exists so families live from

'l'lie Indians exemplifv the lowest
level of povertv in America.

L'suallv there is onlv one school
at each reservation. With grades

go on to a higher education. While
the children attend school in de-
caving bui1dings——their teachers

The religion of the people is
superficial. They are predomin-
antly Congregationalist and Mor-

a 67" lreshinan from South Hills

Pittsburgh. tallied a three point
play with :59 seconds remaining
that the Blues could claim a 82-
70 victory. .

As the second half got under
way, the Golds quickly, literally,
got back into the contest when
Knight began to do his number.
-Bill Sulkowski ,(l2), forward Jim
Bolla (15), Kirk Bruce (13), and
Ken Wagoner (10) brought the
Golds back, and added to Knight’s
18 points, who took the lead with

“It was just what I hoped to

I think we need a lot more work.”

    Jancisin Defends Spit

as he was introduced.

 

By JANICE BUCCIGROSSI
Associate Sports Editor

With a 1-9 record and one more game yet to
play. any gridder could very easily be dishearten-
ed to say the least. A feeling of depression could
overcome any player in this situation especially
if this last contest is against Penn State.

But the Panthers‘ defensive tackle Dave Jan-
cisin is not about to give up on the season even
at this point.

"I want to win. most of the other guys do too."
emphasized Jancisin. "We have to be able to get
up for the game. though. I don't think they (Penn
State) think too much about us as a team because
of our record.”

A lot of what will happen against Penn State
then will depend on the Panthers’ mental attitude
according to Jancisin. But if the way the Cats have
held up throughout most of the season, Jancisin
feels that Pitt will be in the game mentally as
well as physically.

DAVE JANCISIN, the Panthers’ defensive tackle,
.gives- chase .to the UCLA Bruin’s second string
quarterback Rob Scribner. J\c:fncisin has been plagued
" by injuries throughout-..the '72 season.

few seniors will be gone." »

 
 

"We've been up for most of the games. Nobody.
was up for the Navy game at all last week." he

related. Noione did outstanding at all.’ We

were just out there in another world. '

"For us.lossing like we have this season we
got up for the games," continued the sophomore
defensive tackle. "The spirit got bad at the end
of the year —- it wasn’t as goodas before. ‘So now
that it's at the end of the season it‘s bad but I'm
sure we‘ll be up for Penn State."

Despite all the spirit displayed by the Panthers
throughout the year, it was only good enough to
come up with one win. Jancisin, however, feels
that the team’s record is not a true indication of
what the Panthers are capable of doing.

"Pitt did really bad as the records show."
commented Jancisin. “But the
way we played the games really
doesn‘t show -— the record doesn’t
show the real abilityiof the team.
The bad breaks could be the rea-
son for our performance but I

Speaking of the defensive units
performance specifica_lly. Janci-
cin stated. "The defense was put
in a lot of bad situations with the many fumbles
and interceptions that happened earlier in the
year.

JANCISIN

“There were a.few breakdowns the defense
made that caused big breaks but most of the time,
though, we held our own.”

Along with the entire football season. Jancisin
was not overly pleased with his own performance.

"It hasn‘t been a good as I expect. some gam-
es were good. some were bad.“ said Jancisin. "I
thought that I could do better. I was just playing
like a sophomore — inexperienced."

But despite everything that has happened this
season, Jancisin is looking forward to a good sea-
son next year.

I

"I'm looking forward to a winning season next
year and so is everyone else". related Jancisin.
"Some of the teams that we will be playing will

be tough but it'll be an easier schedule. And we‘ll-

lcers Brawl tln
lncliana Rematch  

by BART MACK

When the Indiana skaters took the ice on Wednesday night -

to play Pitt. it was evident that they were out for blood to revenge
the two defeats that Pitt dealt to them .last year. By the time the
game was over, however. it was blood from a pair of Indiana icers
that spotted the ice as Pitt triumphed. 6-2.

Indiana came‘out hitting hard in a" game that saw almost as

many fights as goals. Pitt showed that they weren’t going to take any- .

thing from anybody and returned Indiana‘s attempt to intimidate
them with four goals in the first period and some brutal punish-
ment of their own in the next two periods. I
The ‘lush line‘ gotthings off to an early start when Phil Clarke
tallied his first of two goals. Billy Glanville picked up a loose puck
in the Indiana end and fired a perfect pass to "Clarke. who was
cruising in on that net. The goal came with only 1:15 gone in the
initial period.
Denny Browne came up with his second goal of the season when
' he took a stray puck at the .Indiana blue line and skated in on goal
untouched. Browne’s goal at the 6:24 mark gave Pitt a quick 2-0 lead
but Indiana kept on trying to out-muscle the skaters. -

The Indiana strategy backfired. however, when one‘of their
-skaters was calledfor charging. giving Pitt the power play for H n
minutes. Midway through the penalty Craig Mintz fired a quick
wrist. shot from 20 feet out to give Pitt. all the goals they really need-
ed. Mike Kohl assisted on the power play tally. .

‘With only a minute left in the period Pitt received the man
advantage again and Dave Bahnson took the lioiiors for the skaters.
balinsoir with help from his linemate Frank Williams iound the
range in a wild scramble in front of the Indiana net.

The second period began just as the first had ended-—with Pitt
on the power play. Denny Browne fired a shot that was blocked by

‘ the Indiana defense but the rebound was easily gathered in by Billy
Glanville who tucked it past the Indiana netminder.

Pitt had two more manpower advantages in thencxt live l’illll-
iites but could not capitalize on them. Then Pitt vvas called for too
many men on the ice and Indiana sent out their power play attack.

Doug Arnold scored at the 9:12 mark with only 12 seconds left in

the Indiana power play to put his team on the scoreboard.
A minute later the ill"8W0l'l{SVbl_'Ul{€ out. Mike Kohl was the tirst

On Monday Pitt was represent-
ed at the IC4A's by Bob Steele._
Mickev Collins and Nick Mar-
tin.
With approximately 205 athletes

competing. Bob Steele came in
18th with a timeiof 25.02 enabl-
ing him to qualify foiﬁthe NCAA
in Houston. Texas on l\'ovember
20th. With times being much fast-

er this year. had it been 1971.
Steele would have been in eighth
place.

 "I‘m happ\' with m\‘ time."

said Steele.

“Cemetery hill, a difficult
part of the course, was the turn-
ing point for me, I passed five
runners and that was a big men-
tal booster,” he continued.

Disappointed Pitt couldn't go
as a team. Steele is hopeful that
next year the harriers will be

I '5;ible_ to do so. Before Steele looks

’\-.

toward next \'ear's cross country

season he is looking towards the ,

NCAA meet on Mondav.
_.--'.s,It should be anexperience."
he continued.

“I’ve been working out with
Jerry Richey (a former, NCAA
champion from Pitt) the last sev-
eral days and he’s helped me a
great deal,” commented Steele.

“I've been working out on the
track because Houston is flat."
he continued.

Also competing in. the meet
was i\'ick -Martin. a freshman.

of 25.42.

“His time was good,” com-
mented Head Coach Jim Ban-
ner.

"lt’s represents a good effort
otﬁlls part." he continued.

Speaking of ‘the meet. _Martin
‘feels it was a good experience.

“I wasn’t satisfied with my
place but I was satisfied with my
time,” he continued.

"I could have done better but
Ive had a groin pull all season
and this slows down nix" start
which is verxtimportant in a big
meet such as" the IC‘s." said
Martin. '
> Looking back on_ the season
Martin feels it was successful
for him. ’

“I increased my strength,” he
said.

Martin is now looking lorward
to indoor track which will start-
in Januarv. .’

The third representative from
Pitt was Mickev Collins.

Collins didn’t do well due to
the lack of conditioning and his
injured foot. He hadn’t worked
out for the 10 days prior to the
meet.

"I was out in front for the first
quarter milebut fell back stead-
ilx‘ after that.“ said Collins.

‘'1 was disappointed." he con-
tinued.

Practicing now for indoor track
Collins is looking forward to the
indoor track season also.

Besides individual competi-
tion. teams competed in the
lL‘4A's.

Manhattan came in first place
with 141 pts. Villanova was sec-
ond with 138 pts. and Penn State
who expected to win the, meet
came in third.

“It was the strongest field in
theihistory of the meet,” com-
mented Coach Mollenhauer.

The season is over for the liar-
riers with the exception of Bob

on Monday in the i\'L‘AA‘s.

a big time football program. Well
gollv gee. I guess that makes ‘us

is. that it's a ridiculous scene to
see grown men pondering over
high school athletes. in order to
get talent for a team.

Dear Mike,

Whether it is morally right or
wrong to give athletic scholar-
ships is a topic not easily debat-
ed. The argument could go on in-
definately. ‘The people who do
all this recruiting feel the public
relations it ‘produces is worth the
effort. Pitt can and does have fine
academic standards. But,_ because
of their-commitment to their pro-
gram (1 mean the schedule which
cannot be broken) it is impossi-
ble to win if you drop scholar-
ships. Your point is one of mor-
ality and there are others ‘I who_
share your opinion. But, unfor-
tunately for-you, You are out-
numbered.

Boeing is back.

. ner and jetliner orders are V

This fall marks the ﬁrst time since 1969
that Boeing has had a formal recruiting pro-
gram on college campuses.’ A
lot has happened since then.
It was a tough period. One
which saw the aerospace in-
dustry plagued with ‘man-
power reductions. It was a
period of belt tightening,
soul searching, and ﬁnally,
accomplishment. .3

Now the airline in-
dustry has turned the cor-

coming faster than we ever
predicted. Orders for the 727-
200 have passed the 1,000 mark, and the \
sale of ten 707’s to China represents a break-
through which gained Worldwide attention.
Boeing continues to pursue vigorously a
number of major aerospace programs, includ-
ing a short takeoff and landing (STOL) air-
craft, helicopters, the Airborne Warning and
Control System (AWACS), and space vehicles
and equipment, among others. ‘
Boeing Computer Services, Inc., a wholly-
owned subsidiary, is becoming recognized as
a broad based company with services not only
in consulting, training, computer system de-
sign, programming, and data processing, but
also in management, operations research, and
management, of customer computer facilities.
While the major elements of our business
continue to be commercial jet transportation
and government defense and space require-
ments, we have begun activities outside these

  
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
  

traditional areas. Measured on the scale of
total company operations, these diversiﬁca-
tion activities don’t loom very
large yet. But we believe
’ they have potential for
the future and could
represent as much as
25 percent of total
sales in a decade.
A few of these pro-
grams are: 1) people
 movers to unclog traffic
conditions in our cities; '2)

freight over water faster; 3) a
100,000-acre test site where we’re growing
crops in a desert that has been stabilized with
garbage from a nearby city;' 4) a pollution
control process that has application in de-
salination and as a treatment of industrial
waste; and 5) aerospace programs that can
lead to a better understanding of how to
use this planet’s natural resources more
efficiently. ‘

The point is—today Boeing is a lean,
ambitious, and very inventive company. A
place where new ideas ﬂourish. Where an
attitude prevails that nothing we did before
is good enough for tomorrow. An organization
that’s rebuilding. Strong. Healthy. And de-
-voted to the development of new systems that
can keep planet Earth on course and. the
people who live here healthy.

If thissounds like the kind of company
you can grow with, let’s get together. The
place to start is with your Placement Ofﬁce.

The tickets will sell for $2.50

tickets to be sold at the schools.
Those tickets went on sale for
$1,50.'Al1 student tickets for the

Pitt. There are still some 80 tick-
ets available for the Saturday
night final. . H

With approximately three weeks

of students are expected to be
looking for additional ducats.

"We feel that a lot more [lCi\c'.

ets could be sold." said Dean Bil-
lick. Pitt Sports Information Dir-
ector. "We feel that by putting
these General Admission tickets
on sale will allow a lot more of
our students to attend the games.

Nov.

through this year. he has found
occasion to rib Jelic about his in-
eptitude on the football field.
when Jelic was a player maybe
for lack of other pleasentries to
talk about.

And while Fazio wore a smerk-

'ish smile. Jelic found it necessary

to come to his own defense.

"If you look that up in the
book you"ll see that‘s not true."
Jelic would rib back. i

"What book. That book doesnt
exist." Fazio would rebut.

Well. after a very intriquate
search—looking in the top drawer
of Jelic's desk——tlie book turned
up and Fazio was laid to rest.

Ralph Jelic. who didn‘t receive
the majority of the ink in those
days._ did receive the most play-
ing time of all running backs.

The book. the 1956 Pitt press
guide. in bold type. proclaimed
that Jelic had put in 371 minutes
of pla_ving time, both as a full-
back and a linebacker.

Jim Theodore l338l. Tom
Jenkins (256l and Roy De P_as-
quale i223) all had less playing
minutes than Jelic.

With this triumph behindhim.
Jelic still faces the dubious
task of putting together a de-
fense that can stop the opposition
week-to-week. This coming week
it will be powerful Penn State.

And though not’ even Jelic is
claiming a success. the reasons
