Noted F

novelist
visits Pitt

Tegan Hanlon I
Staﬂ” Writer

A group of adolescent boys sit in a car in Brook-
lyn, tripping on acid and drinking beer. They
label themselves as “underage and chemically
dependent.” They discuss love. _ 

The boys entertain the idea that society
has managed to package sex and sell it, as they
watch a prostitute work an alley from the car
window. -

Novelist Michael Thomas recounted this ,

scene and others from his debut novel “Man
Gone Down” at the Frick Fine Arts Auditorium
last night. A short question-and—answer ses-
sion followed the reading, as part of the Pitts-
burgh Contemporary Writers Series.

Pitt’s Book Center, University of Pittsburgh
Press and Pitt’s English Department sponsored
the event. _ I

For an hour, the scene resembled the same
“story time” most experience in their child-
hood. Thomas altered his voice to represent
each character as he read to an audience of
more than 150 students and Pittsburgh resi-
dents who periodically erupted into laughter,
as if on cue. _ ,

“These characters do no represent any-
thing.'I see things. I hear things. I come up
with lines, and I turn them loose. After they
are on the pageand doing things I see their
likeness to other people. And what I do after
is I allude to something, some archetype,”
Thomas said.

An audience member commented that
Thomas’ work reads almost as poetry.

“I think any novelist is a failed poet — for-
get about all of the poets in the room,” he said
in response. “They’re all full of themselves.”

The Pitt football team found itself trail-
ing Connecticut late in the fourth quar-
ter for the second straight season last

. night.

Yet this time the Panthers weren’t

able to come away with a .come-from—-

behind win.
Pitt left the game with a 30-28 loss at

the hands of the Huskies at Rentschler

Field in.East Hartford, Conn.
Connecticut (5-4, .2-2) ran» the ball

' at will for most of the game. The Pitt

defense came into the game giving up
93.8 rushing yards per game but allowed
249 last night, including 222 to Huskies
running back Jordan Todman.

“We’ve got to tackle better,” Pitt head
coach Dave Wannstedt said at halftime.
“He [Todman] runs «low to the ground.”

- While the Panther defense did play
better after halftime, the team was vic-
timized by special-teams errors as they
let Nick Williams run a kickoff back for
a 95-yard touchdown on one and Ray
Graham lost a fumble on another.

Pitt grabbed momentum right away
when safetyjarred Holley intercepted a
Zach Frazer ﬂea—ﬂicker pass on the first

' play from scrimmage.

Dion Lewis scored a touchdown on a
4-yard run on the ensuing drive.

But Pitt trailed 13-7 at halftime and
just seemed like it couldn’t execute one of
Wannstedt’s keys to the game: “We have
to be able to play in a tough environment
and not get distracted,” he said before
the game.

Miscues certainly did the Panthers

. (5-4, 3-1 Big East) in last night. From

Graham’s lost fumble and the touchdown
Pitt’s special teams allowed to two Tino
Sunseri interceptions, Pitt just couldn’t
seem to make a play when it needed to.

Correction:

An article printed yesterday titled “Activities fee to fund green projects” incorrectly said that thestudent Sustainable Projects
Committee and a proposed “greenﬁm ” are the same entity. The article also incorrectly implied that the green fund pilot program
would have added a $5 increase to the Student Activities Fee. The article also incorrectly quoted Molly Stieber as speaking on
behalfof the whole Student Government Board. Stieber said she was only speaking for herself, Environmental Committee chair-
woman Rebecca Schroeder and Terry Milani, the assistant director of student activities. The Pitt News Regrets the errors.

Schools’ graduation deadlines approach

' Marissa Meredyth
Sta_[fWriter'

Undergraduate students looking to graduate
in April 2011 from schools otherthanArts and
Sciences should plan on submitting graduation
applications before the end of the term to avoid
penalty charges.

Students must submit completed forms to
the dean’s ofﬁce within their school, accord-
ing to the Ofﬁce of the University Regi'strar’s
website. The ofﬁce does not accept these forms
directly. Each school sets its own application
deadlines, and individual academic programs
can require additional forms beyond the three-
page application provided by the registrar.

However, the registrar’s ofﬁce does set pre-
liminary dates after which they will accept
applications from the schools, as well as ﬁnal
dates. The office also charges penalty fees for
late applications.

The registrar’s ofﬁce accepts graduation
applications beginning] an. 4 and throughjan.
21 with no fees. Beginning onjan. 24, there is a
$15 fee. The fee increases to $25 on March 3 and
to $35 on March 25. The last day the registrar’s

ju-

ofﬁce accepts applications is April 8.
As The Pitt News reported yesterday, these

requirements apply to the School of Arts and .

H Sciences as well. After today, students will be
charged a $25 fee when they turn in their ap-
plication to the Arts and Sciences Office ofUn-
dergraduate Studies in 140 Thackeray Hall.

Potential graduates should also keep in
mind that applicants must be in good ﬁnan-
cial standing with the University to receive
the diploma, and that if the graduation was
previously postponed, seniors must submit a
new application.

The name on your graduation application
“mustbe identical to the way it appears on the

University’s student information system,” ac- ,
cording the registrar’s website. Students must

provide legal documentation if their name
has changed.

Students in the School of Education should.

have applications turned in no later thenjan.
19 to avoid penalty fees, said Jill Braithwaite,
student services administrator. This should
include a plan of studies signed by their advi-
sor.
From there she said the school will review

transcripts to make sure everything is in order.

Students with questions are encouraged to
contactthe graduation coordinator at 412-624-
2909 or e-mail soeinfo@pitt.edu.
Representatives from the School of Health
and Rehabilitation Sciences said they follow the
deadlines set by the registrar’s ofﬁce regarding

‘ graduation application. According to Mindy

Columbus, SHRS director of Student Services,

the six departments within the school may dif— '

fer in additional forms or surveys wanted.
The School of Information Sciences also
follows the the deadlines set by the registrar’s
office, according to their administration oﬂice.
Theywill cross~check the forms before sending
them to Thackeray. P
_ The College of Business Administration
also follows the registrar’s ofﬁce deadlines and

. penalty fees. Camille Burgess, CBA Student

Records manager, said, “[CBA] student’s had
their senior reviews with advisers long ago,
where they would have discussed graduation
requirements.” Burgess also said she audits
student’s academicrecords to make sure they
are on track to, graduate.

According to their administration oﬂice,
the Swanson School of Engineering is currently
accepting applications for April graduation.

Mechanical engineering stude’nt‘Matthew
Hershey said he turned his graduation ap-
plication in months ago. Other engineering
students, like chemical ‘engineering student
Ben Dickinson and mechanical engineering
student Justin Bressi, are waiting until next
semester to turn in graduation applications.

Dickinson said that students can get ap-
plication forms from their departments and
must turn them in within the ﬁrst two weeks of

the semester if they plan to graduate to avoid .
fees. Students planning to graduate in April

would need to turn their applications in by
the second week of nextsemester in order to
avoid charges.

The College of General Studies requires '

students to schedule a graduation appointment
“at the beginning of the registration period
for the graduation term,” according to their
website. ‘ ‘

Registrationforthis year’s spring term be-
gan earlier this month. Students should have
scheduled an appointment for late October, the
website says. Tim Carr, Senior Adviser for the
College of General Studies, did not respond to
requests for comment. Students with questions
can reach him at 412-624-7012.. I‘

Writer sets scenes from novel in Frick

Thomas 4 1

ognition since its publication in 2006. Thomas
received the 2010-11 Fred R. Brown Literary
Award and the IMPAC Dublin Literary Award
in 2009.

“People say the IMPAC Dublin Award is
the largest and most international literary
prize in the world, after the Nobel,” said Lynn
Emanuel, director of the Pittsburgh Contem-
porary Writers Series.

The novel was named a Notable Book by
both The New York Times and the San Fran—-
cisco Chronicle and was selected as one of
the top—ﬁve novels of 2007 by The New York

Times.

Thomas said Dr. Seuss’ work has inﬂuenced
him.

,“He writes nonsense that makes sense,” he
said. “Others are Ellison, Eliot, Baldwin, Bob
Dylan, Marley — there are so many things.
They know how to evoke something. I want
to mimic tha ” V

. The organizers hoped that Thomas’ work
would inspire writers in the audience and that
hearing the novel read aloud would be an enjoy-
able experience for all, said Eryn Morgan, ad-
ministrative assistant to the writersseries.

“He’s young, relevant, fresh and most cer-
tainly up-and-coming,” Morgan said.

Thomas’ next work, “The Broken King,” is
due out in 2011. r

“I am currently working on what my pub-
lisher calls a ‘memoir,”’ Thomas said. “I think
in my good moments when I feel ambitious and
optimistic about my career I call it ‘a series of
linked essays.”’ . '

A free question-and‘-answer lunch recep-
tion with Thomas will be held today at 12:20
p.m. at The University Club. Students and fac-
ulty are encouraged to attend. I

LEITER 1'0 THE EDITOR

To the Editor,

We would like to address some issues regard-
ing Monday’s article aboutjoseph Dana’s pre-
sentation. We support peaceful cooperation of

' Palestinians and Israelis butwere disappointed

in The Pitt News’ inaccurate reporting regard-
ing the event, Students forjustice in Palestine’s
slanderous representation of Israel and Dana’s
lack of balance.

The ﬁrst major error committed by The Pitt
News was in deﬁning and describing Israel’s
security barrier. The Pitt News repeatedly re-

‘ ferred to the security barrier as a “wall” thatwas

“partwood, part concrete.” This is simply gross
negligence in reporting. Over 97 percent of the
security barrier is chain-link fence. The short
concrete sections are there to stop Palestinian
terrorists from shooting through the fence and
killing innocent Israeli civilians as they drive
on Israeli roads (mfa.gov.-il). Conveniently for
Dana, he neglected to mention that the security

fence was built in response to the thousands of
Israelis killed in terrorist attacks and has drasti-
cally cut down on Palestinian terrorist attacks
in Israel. Even the leaderlof the terrorist group
Palestinian Islamicjihad admitted the security
fence has stopped his group from being able to

commit suicide bombings in Israel (Intelligence A

& Terrorism Information Center).

Next, The Pitt News repeatedly referenced
a nonexistent country “Palestine.” Palestine
was in fact a British mandate that ended over
62 years ago. It is now the internationally rec-
ognized State of Israel — which is the Jewish
homeland and onlyJewish country — as well
asjordaii, the West Bank and Gaza. This action
by The Pitt News is not only geopolitically incor-
rect, it is downright irresponsible.

When I was in the ﬁrst grade, my school
caught on to this brand-new thing called the
computer. The faculty gathered the whole
class, and the parents ooh—. ed and aah-ed at
the big box Macintosh with the multicolored
apple. For an entire year, I rode the Oregon
Trail .all day, every day like it was my job.
If one of my wagon companions died of
dysentery, well, life was rough on the road
out West. The school convinced me that I’d
be the next Bill Gates if I could just make it
to the Paciﬁc.

In an unfortunate reality check, I realized
that playing rudimentary video games was
not the ﬁrst step on the yellow brick road
leading to Larry Page’s garage. While the

technology in America was growing like
Don King’s afro. The problem? It wasn’t
happening anywhere near Pittsburgh. As of
2008, the three top technology job centers
were New York, Washington, D.C., and Sili-
con Valley, with over 800,000 of America’s
jobs in the technicaLﬁelds, according to
Marketwatch.

Look, I’m all about Pittsburgh. If you’re
into rusting bridges and minor league base-
ball teams, you probably love Pittsburgh
too. .

However, every country has something
that it sticks to. China has tiny gymnasts.
Germany has inciting world wars. Kenya
has marathons. America has innovation,
and today that means technology.

How to succeed in labs without really trying

Reiser explains thingsuthat annoy her about computer labs on campus. Chances are, they probably. annoy ‘you. too.

Becky Reiser
Managing Editor

 

I like to think of myself as a patient per-
son. I wait in lines and listen to annoy-
ing, repetitive elevator music while on
hold. I work with children and attempt
to complete math homework.

But all of this goes out the window
when I’m late for class. If it’s 10:45 a.m.
and I just need to print one thing, I have
zero patience. All bets are off, and it’s
every tired, rushed, over—worked college
student for themselves.

You’ve probably run into people like
me before - people who point out empty
computers to students.who are so out of
it that they don’t remember if they prefer
Macs or PCs. You’d probably think, “God,
who is this girl, half—ﬁnished coffee in
hand, pacing back and forth in line?”

Why, that would be me, a self—de—
scribed expert at using campus computer
labs. I’ve decided that since we’re on the
home stretch to ﬁnals, I’ll help you out
a bit by sharing some “early” morning
wisdom. Take note, because you could
be violating some of these rules  and

not even know.
Becky’s tips to computer-lab etiquette:

1. Get off your phone

If there’s a line of people waiting for
a computer, get off your damn phone or
iPod — or any other electronic device
that is not allowed while in flight. Look
out for empty chairs and report to one as
soon as it opens up — or else I’ll point
it out to you, and it will probably be lem-

barrassing. While we’re on the subject of ‘

phones —— please refrain from answering
them while in the computer lab. It’s ‘hard

enough listening to ring tonesfeaturing

pop ‘songs from the Top 40 without them
going off in a quiet computer lab.

2. Full labs are not for Facebbok

I really don’t care about the cute for-
eign boy you met on a Port Authority
bus over the weekend or how debonair
his lensless frames look — and neither
does anyone else trying to print out Eng-
lish papers. Quit gossiping and publicly

stalking —— there’s a mob of late college

students behind you.

3. Limited seats are available
More points off if you decide to enjoy
the wonders of social networking with a

friend right next to you but only use one

of the computers between you. People,
this is not OK. This habit breaks a cardi-
nal rule of computer lab etiquette. There
are a limited number of computers in
each lab, and sometimes not all of them
are even functioning. It is important that,
in a full lab, students recognize the line
forming. Labs are a valuable resource
for students on campus. But they are

A just that, a resource. They should not

be abused or taken advantage of.

4.. Learn how to use basic technology V 1

A new version of‘Microsoft Ofﬁce was

released and installed on all campus co'm— V

puters this past summer. The software
doesn’t like Courseweb or students who
try opening a document straight froman
e~mail. Please, just save all downloads to
the desktop to “enable editing.” It will
really help the ResNet employees who
are organizing printouts. They don’t
have time to repeat the same instruc—
tions over and over. In case you forget:
When opening a file from online (this

applies to everything from PowerPoints
to PDFs) click “save” instead of “open”
when the download box appears. Choose
“Desktop” or “My Documents”. as_the

destination where the document can be _

saved. After the document has completed

L downloading, click “open.” Make sure

you click “enable editing” on the yellow
bar if it opens in Microsoft Office soft-
ware. Yes, it’s an extra step, but you’ll
feel more self—suff1cient when you learn
how to do it. -‘

’ However," if you realize that maybe, just

maybe, you area perpetrator of many of
these offensive coffiputer lab blunders,
then take note. Yes, I will continue to

V police the labswhen I’m late and in a

rush to use a University service. But if
it’s 1:50 p.m. on one of my slower days
and I see someone in line pacing back

that it doesn’t belong in the tech club. It
turns out that our city is full of things other
than Andrew Carnegie and infamous quar-
terbacks. Now, we certainly aren’t the ﬁrst
people to try and take over something we
probably shouldn’t —- I’m looking at you
Dick Cheney. I know thatwhen manufac-
turing left Detroit, all that was left were
unemployment unions and the Lions, but
it’s not like this ex—mill town has resigned
itself to remembering the “good old days.”
Michigan’s governor, Jennifer Granholm,
has instated a new initiative known as “Cool
Cities” as a way to keep college graduates in
the state and end the brain drain. Honestly,
I was just happy to hear that Michigan’s top
public ofﬁcials do something other than just
bash gay college students.

In a similar thread, Pittsburgh has been
thinking bigger, and the city that once
popularized the steel mill is now ensuring
that its former self hits the history books
quicker than Vanilla Ice. A few years ago,
the politicians started to take aim at our
reputation across this country. While Eliot
Spitzer was busy becoming Client Number
9 and George Bush was distracted by what-
ever shiny thing caught his attention, our
representatives were making a change for
the better. Across the cities of Pittsburgh,

Leaders, universities, help e

Youngstown and Cleveland, local leaders
started to come together to respond to the
economic realities of the former Rust Belt.
Other cities have tried revitalization, but
at the end of the day this region is trying

something new. This isn’t Los Angeles and l

the ﬁlm industry or Chicago and smuggling
liquor. What we are doing will be an example
for all the old Rust Belt towns. I know that
asking Pittsburgh to let go of its manufac-
turing roots is like asking Mel Gibson to be
rational, but the steel mills are gone, and
the time of The Tech Belt is upon us.

The Tech Belt Initiative was started to
push this region further into the post-dirty
manufacturing age. While it’s no secret that
the region stretching from Pittsburgh to
Cleveland was devastated when blue-collar
mills became as outdated as Myspace, the
reaction to the economic shift that might
have started off slow is picking up steam. In
fact, just before the G-20 Summit, Obama
said that we had transformed ourselves and
The Economist noticed the same thing and
wrote, “It is also a centre for innovation
in robotics, electronics and nanotechnol-

ogy.

By partnering andworking toward the
improvement of the entire area, the Tech
Belt has been able to secure a real foothold

in the area. just take’ a look at the army of I
committed organizations that have banded

together to aid the Tech Belt. Between the
Allegheny Conference on Community De-

.velop_rnent, the Ben Franklin Technology
Partners; Carnegie Mellon, our own Uni-

versity of Pittsburgh, Innovation Works,
Pittsburgh Life Sciences~Greenhouse and
countless other groups that are opening
vast resources (i.e., thousands of jobs and
millions of dollars), we’ve built an economic
alliance that would make Sauron wet his
pants. And all of this goes without men-
tioning the partners in Youngstown and

Cleveland that are fattening this region up ,

to take on technology. Politicians in the
region likejason Altmire and Tim Ryan have
dedicated themselves to raising funding
and awareness for the burgeoning technical

‘market growing in the ex—Rust Belt. There

has already been over $600 million raised,
and a brand new Innovation Center in Ohio
is set to open next year, according to the
Tribune Chronicle. '

I don’t mean to say that I’m not proud_

of our past, but the Tech Belt Initiative is
exactly what we need to get back into the
game. I have never believed in this area
so much. We can still lead the nation in
manufacturing — just building new gadgets

conomicgrowth a

and more efficient machines instead of bil-

- lowing smokestacks._ Although I might joke

that Carnegie Mellon is a school for robots
(which it is), maybe that’s not such a bad

g thing —- unless you’re in a social setting,

but CMU kids don’t do that anyway. I un-
derstand that trying to take the blue-collar
mill worker out of Pittsburgh is like trying
to take the witch out of Christine O’Donnell,
but we are on the verge of a true economic
breakthrough in this region. Transforming
an entire economy is never easy, but our
politicians and local leaders are sending
us on the path to exponential technologi-
cal growth. ' u

It’s time for each of us to do our part.
Support the Tech Belt Initiative. Write your
congressmen, check out the website, be-
come a fan of it on Facebook. It’s time to
make the entire country realize we’re going

to once again be the backbone of this na- ’

tion’s economy. We need to ﬁght now so that
we can lead the way in robotics, engineering

and advanced manufacturing. It’s time for V

us to recognize that we are not only rich in

natural resources such as coal and natural A

gas, but also in the greatest natural resource
of all: our people. In Pittsburgh we like to
say that on ice or grass, we’llkick your ass.

, Well, we’re going to do it in the lab, too. I

Because Jonathan Meiburg, frontman of
indie band Shearwater, plays in cities al-
most every night, he savors every moment
in nature he can get. _

“These moments take you outside of
where you are,” Meiburg said. “I try to take
them when I can ﬁnd them.”

Meiburg has a long-standing afﬁnity
with the outdoors: He’s an avid bird watch-
er with a master’s degree in geography.
Even the band’s name is taken from a long-
winged sea bird and its most recent album,
The Golden Archipelago, is largely inspired
by Meiburg’s travels to remote corners of
the world, including the Falkland Islands,
Madagascar, the Galapagos Islands and
the Bikini Atoll. A

In 1997 Meiburg received a Thomas J.
Watson Fellowship to study the daily life of
human communities untouched by 20th-
century technology.

“The more I look at humans and ani-
mals, the more alike they seem,” he said.
“I’m fascinated by places that are still pre-
served as the way things were. I had no idea
the world was like that, and it changed the
way I looked at things from then on.”

Although these travels happened more
than 10 years ago, Meiburg has ﬁnally be-
gun to express his experiences musically.

“Sometimes things that happened to
you a long time ago take time to process,”
he said. “I spent time on these islands and
thought it was a fruitful place to go looking
for an album.”

A 50—page dossier of photographs,
immigration records and journal entries
Meiburg collected on his travels is included
with the ﬁrst 10,000 copies of The Golden
Archipelago.

“I included them because no one was
going to see them except for me,” he said.

Sara Pecora
Staff Writer

Ben Folds isn’t just a musician — he’_s a
storyteller. , ‘‘
Along with his keen sense of humor,
the pop singer—songwriter is known for
autobiographical anthems on the joys and

-tribulations of existence. Now, for his lat-

est record, titled Lamb! A1/em/e, Folds has
collaborated with another storyteller who
wrote the album’s lyrics: award—winning
screenwriter and novelist Nick Hornby,
author of “High Fidelity.”

Folds performed at Club Zoo last night,
and The Pitt News had the opportunity to
speak to him about his latest album, his
current tour and the decline of the music
business.

The Pitt News: You’re known for your
lyrics and your writing style. Was it weird
having someone else write them for you?

Ben Folds: Not really. I think a musician
is, y’know, ﬂexible to other people’s music
 that’s what you do. I mean, singers con-
stantly sing other people’s words. You ﬁnd
that a good song will resonate with people
in different ways. It’s not a big deal to me,
especially coming from Nick because I love
Nick’s writing and completely trust what
he writes. It made us work faster, which

was nice. He’d give me the lyrics, and I’d '

kick out some music pretty quickly and
send it back to him.

TPN: You’re on your second season as
a judge on the a capella-group competi-
tion show “The Sing-Off.” Do you feel it’s
strange being a judge of music as opposed
to creating it?

BF: I think it’s not dissimilar from pro-
ducing an album. Now the competition side
is a little foreign to me, but that’s part of
the fun of the show, and that’s part of the
competitors’ motivation. The part that 1155;-
really attracted to is that, here are ama-
teurs stepping up and it’s tough. [Laughs]
It’s really hard to do. So I think they need
a kind but firm sounding board. I don’t
view it as thumbs up, thumbs down, you
suck, you’re great; I think of it as, here;s
what you’ve done, here’s what I’d like to
see you do and here’s how I think you can

get there.

TPN: I know it’s almost passé at this
point to discuss music piracy, but obvi-
'ously it affects every musician. Is it much
of a problem for you?

BF: I don’t know  these are interesting
things to ponder. I mean, I’ve never been
afraid of it, but it has a big impact on the
business, and I am in the business. On the
surface, it would appear all of our incomes
have been cut quite substantially as a result
and  a lot of people have lost jobs  The
music business is in horrendous condition,
so you would think that affects me.

A But I don’t know what it would’ve been
e,,l__il<e if the business had kept cranking the
way it was  I don’t know if that’s better
for music or if I would still be in business
in that environment. This environment
may be better for me. I

This is probably controversial, but I
don’t think that anyone who takes music
should be punished for it, and I don’t know
why, because they are stealing, but I
don’t know. [Laughs] Ijust don’t think they
should be punished for that.

We may have lived through an era 
that was very unusual, a very strange era
where musicians and people involved in
music could get rich  I think before that,
it was a much smaller business. They didn’t
even have records or mass concert promo-
tions or radio stations, and this business
that came up was possible because of the

physical distribution ... I think now it’s
going back where it came from. Maybe I
was supposed to be a traveling minstrel,
I don’t know.

TPN: You wrote “Gracie” and “Still

Fighting It” about your kids. Do you ever
worry that you’ll write other songs about
them in the future that will violate their
privacy? I
BF: N o, I don’t worry about that. I think
I would have raised spoiledlchildren if they
get upset because those are a gift, and I

think they really dig them. To have that V

record -— what a parent wasthinking .  it’d
be like if I found-a letter that-my parents
had written to me and put in a box, and you

get a little time capsule. That’s what those '
_ songs are: little time capsules.

TPN: Do you think you’re going to keep
challenging yourself? = . I

BF: Well, the most important thing to
me is to do things that have that feeling
like when you made your ﬁrst record  I
adapt to a situation that  without being
Mr. Rogers, lets me make some discovery.
You don’t need to do something that you’re
like, “Ah, I know what this is gonna sound
like before it comes out‘ of the speakers —
that’s why I did it!” No, you did it because
you haven’t heard it yet.’ That’s whyyou
do it. And if that means I do a record with
f*cking Evel Knievel’s grandson, great.
And if that means I just.do a solo piano in
a hotel room, I might do that. I l

you have to make sense of it somehow.

The Golden Archipelago was recorded
in only one week and has received mainly
positive reviews from critics and fans
alike.

“We wanted to make a record without
regard of what people thought and just
have the joy of doing something on the
spot,” Meiburg said. “We did it just for
the love of it.”

Meiburg is not alone in this sentiment.
Bassist Kimberly Burke — who, prior to

-the recording, lived in Boston though the
rest of the band lived in Austin -—— spent
time listening to recordings Meiburg sent
her and worked on the bass lines in her
living room. Although lyrically the group
is mostly under Meiburg’s creative direc-

I tion, Burke felt she was still contributing

‘ musically despite the distance.

“It’s some of my best work as a bass
player,” Burke said. “I liked helping to craft
the direction and energy of bringing the

songs together.”

As a.female bassist in a music scene
largely dominated by men, Burke claims
she never feels out of place within her own
group but is quick to notice when female
musicians are on stage.

“A lot of time when I’m on tourwith
seven dudes and we see a band with a chick,
I’m the ﬁrst to point it out. I’m more aes-
thetically interested in the band like that
because they’re not homogenous,” she said.
“Maybe people in the rock scene aren’t
thinking about it [the lack of women in
music], but they should be.”

The band’s tour is short -—— lasting only
through November -—— but it has been play-
ing in a different city almost nightly for
each show. After a stop in Washington, D.C.,
the tour van was broken into and many of
the group’s personal items were stolen.

“Fortunately, they didn’t lift the gear or
steal the van,” Meiburg said. “Otherwise,
we would have had to cancel the tour.” I

Brian Regan: I’ve been there a number of

earthy, also depending on whichway you enter

BIG EAST BREAKDOWN _....

Big East
winding 

down

Donnie Tasser
Staﬁ Writer

 

It’s crunch time, everybody. No Big East team

A is bowl eligible yet, but Pitt, Louisville, South

Florida, Syracuse and West Virginia can all
clinch eligibility with a win. We are coming
down to the nitty-gritty part of the season,
with only four weeks left. On that note, let
us begin.

Power Rankings

Pittsburgh —- The Panthers are sitting
pretty with a two—game conference lead and
the possible return of last year’s Big East Co-
Defensive Player of the Year, defensive end
Greg Romeus, for last night’s game against
Connecticut. Throughout conference play,
their offense has been extremely balanced
and consistent and the defense has been
lights out.

Louisville — Coach Charlie Strong
coached the Cards to a 28-20 upset over the
second place team, Syracuse, last week with
a back-up quarterback and running back.
Big East leading rusher Bilal Powell will be
back for their game against USF this week,
but quarterback Adam Froman might not.
They won once with a backup quarterback
and can do it again.. If they win this week
they clinch a bowl berth, which is far more
than anyone predicted of them.

South Florida — The Bulls won a one-
point squeaker (28-27) over Rutgers last
Wednesday — seriously, whatever happened
to primetime weekend games? — and look
much improved from their offensive futility
of a few short weeks ago. They have a big
matchup with Louisville this week —— let’s
see if quarterback B.J. Daniels can keep the
heat turned up.

Syracuse — The Orange stumbled:-a
bit this week following their home loss to
Louisville, but are still in good shape. At
6-3 they own the best overall record in the
conference and are sitting in second place
with a 3-2 league record (half a game up on
Louisville and USF). They are proven road
winners but struggle at home, which makes

Late fourth—down conversion seals the Panthers fate

Football< 1

But trailing 30-21 in the fourth quar-
ter, it seemed like the Panthers had new
life when Sunseri found Jon Baldwin in
the end zone for a 20-yard touchdown

“lib cut thelead to two with 4:35 left to
play.

It seemed as if the Pitt defense had
stopped Connecticut on the next drive,
forcing a fourth and one, but the Hus-
kies went for it and converted, sealing
the game.

Sunseri finished the game 20 for 28
with a touchdown and two interceptions,
while Baldwin finished with six catches
for 95 yards_ and a score. _

Although Pitt couldn’t seem to stop the

‘gun, it was able to run the ball itself.

Lewis finished with 77 yards on 13

carries and Graham added 75 yards. Each

scored a touchdown.

A The loss drops Pitt’s lead in the Big
East to only one game heading into the
ﬁnal three—game stretch of the confer-
ence schedule.

But the Panthers’ goal has been the
same all season and won’t change.
Senior leader and defensive endjabaal
Sheard summed it up well earlier this
week in a press conference.

ing a lot more focused, and we want this

this week’s game at Rutgers all the more
:?E3Sy to pick.

West Virginia —— The Mountaineers are
way too talented to be doing as badly as they
are. Cincinnati’s defense will provide the free
points that could jump start Noel Devine and
friends. The Mountaineers have lost two
straight in this series and Bill Stewart needs
a win here to keep his Big East hopes —— and
job security alive. . —

Connecticut — The Huskies have been
very one-dimensional on offense and have
had trouble scoring in conference play (scor-
ing 24, 0 and 16 points the past three games)

‘ageing into last night’s game with Pitt. Run-
ningbackjordan Todman is dangerous, but
Pitt’s run defense is tough. The Huskies --
whose season looked like it was in jeopardy a
short while ago —— are still bowl—eligible.

Rutgers — The Scarlet Knights suffered

wlzvad luck last Wednesday when they lost by
one point in a game in which an offensive
lineman had the game-winning score. Talk
about a bad season. They can right the ship
with a big home win against Syracuse this

weekend intheir ﬁrst home game since the
Eric LeGrand tragedy. C

Cincinnati — With two straight losses at
home and a shoddy defense, it’s no wonder
the Bearcats are sitting in last place. Maybe
the return of quarterback Zach Collaros can
spark this team to continue its win streak

. over West Virginia. The Mountaineers’ de-

fense provides a stiff challenge, but their
offense is in a funk — which is great news
for that terrible defense.

C jection. The Big East has ties with six bowl

games, but remember —— if a team is not
bowl-eligible, it doesn’t get to participate.

BCS (Fiesta) — Pittsburgh. The Pan-
thers are the clear favorite to land the Big
East’s automatic BCS bowl berth this season,
which looks to be the Fiesta. The Fiesta picks
last among the BCS bowls this year, and the
Big East this season has made sure they are
the least-favored of the conferences.

Champs Sports —— Syracuse. The
Champs Sports Bowl will go to the confer-

ence’s second-place team, and with only
Rutgers and Connecticut left, the Orange
look like they are in position to snag the
conference’s No. 2 spot.

Meineke Car Care —- West Virginia. The
Mountaineers already have two conference
losses as well as a remaining schedule that
includes the Backyard Brawl and Louisville,
and they’ve already suffered a loss to Syra-
cuse. Third place and the Meineke Car Care
Bowl is their likely destination. _

BBVA Compass —— Louisville. The Cards
can clinch bowl eligibility with a win, but
with South Florida and WVU as two of their
last three games, nothing is certain. The out-
come of this week’s showdown with South
Florida will determine if they slide in at No.
4 or No. 5 in the conference.

Beef ‘0’ Brady’s — South Florida. You’re

right, I’ve never heard of the Beef ‘O’ Bra-

dy’s Bowl either. But apparently it’s here
for the ﬁfth-place team. The Bulls’ remain-
ing schedule — Louisville, Pitt, Miami and
Connecticut —— is not easy. They only need
to win one game to clinch a bowl bid, but it

Panthers still on pace to goto BCS bowl game

will be ‘tough.

New Era Pinstripe —— Connecticut. The
Huskies need to win two out of their last four
games (including last night’s) to clinch a
bowl berth. If they do, I don’t see them get-
ting anything better than the Big East’s last
spot. The New Era Pinstripe Bowl —- held
in the new Yankee Stadium ——- would prefer
this team be Rutgers or Syracuse, but hey,
you don’t always get what you want.

In what-has become sort of a tradition, I
will once again hand out prestigious hard-
ware to end my column. Since there were
only two Big East games last week, the pick-
ins were slim. -

Defensive Player of the Week: Jacquian
Williams, linebacker, South Florida

Williams registered 11 tackles and 1.5
sacks in the Bulls’ win over Rutgers.

Offensive Player of the Week: Jacob
Sims, offensive tackle, South Florida

The man experienced the dream ofpos-
sibly every offensive lineman and recovered
a fumble in the end zone in what proved to be
the game-winning score. ’Nough said. I
