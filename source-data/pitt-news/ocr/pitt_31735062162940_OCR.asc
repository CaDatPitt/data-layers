this new bulletin, or ‘catalog,

'‘which will be offered in the . .
His’ statement squelched rumors that have been circulating

..'to the effect that there would be
no more bulletin for the Schoo

‘V _, of Liberal Arts.

Dr. Martin explained: “There

ii“-.W3S no 1959-60\ catalog because
 the School of the Liberal Arts is
e _ beginning a review for the pur-

pose of revising the academic pro-
gram for the school," said Dr.
Martin. “However, there will be
one coming out sometime in May.”
Will Be Condensed

 » This bulletin will be somewhat
‘condensed in comparison with the
old bulletin of the 1958-59 school
year. A year from the release of
this bulletin there will be another

bulletin published for the school
’ -in which a completely new revised

program will be outlined to sup-
plement the listing and describing

 of the courses.

“The Liberal Arts office has
1 . been gathering information from
 its different departments for the
1960-61 eatdlog which will be an
abbreviated catalog under the
old format. The following year
i there will be a new catalog un-
A der new format describing the
new curriculum,” remarked Dr.
Martin.
He further explained that,each
department is trying to divide its
courses into three speciﬁc_classi-
ﬁcations. First, they want to offer
a course which would give the
student the breadth of the disci-
pline, covering the material so
that the student can receive an
s overall outlook on the context of
the subject.
Specialized Courses

Secondly, they are attempting to
set up a general group of subjects
for ‘the student majoring in that
specific field. This would also in-
— clude the subjects in related ﬁelds.

And third, . group of special-

ized courses that would be taken

’ after this general group of ma-

jor ‘subjects- The specialized

-subjects would go further into

the more ﬁnely divided context
lot’ the subject matter.

“Some schools have become in-
volved in a very bitter conflict
over what their curriculum should
be, and I never want to see this
development at Pitt,” continued
the dean.

Manual Replaces Bulletin

Because of the, absence of the
bulletin during this academic
ye: -, the Liberal Arts advisers
have been given an adviserfs man-
ual which resembles the bulletin

. in form.

They also have a schedule of
classes for the spring and fall
‘trimester which will be used
until the next bulletin comes
out.

plans for the institute. Ten sen-
ior scientists with ‘four or ﬁve
associates each will comprise the
nucleus of the permanent staff at
the outset, Dr. Salk said.

Counting other staff person-'
nel, the permanent total will
number 100 to 2001 He declined
to identify any of the other sci-
entists involved in the institute.
However, “No one who is pres!-
ently in Pittsburgh has been con-
sidered for the institute,” he re-
vealed. / ’
Plans for the institute, ‘which
will be independent of any other

organization, have been under dis-
cussion for more than a year, he
said. ‘
Assured of Funds’
Besides the $20 million the in-
stitute will receive from the Na-
tional Foundation during a ten-
year period, Dr. Salk stated that
individuals will receive grants
from the “usual agencies.” He
said he has been assured raising
building funds _will not be a
problem. 2 ,
Dr. Salk said the decision.for
the institute’s location “was not
based on any offer or induce-
ment. It was a decision based on
the general feeling of a number
of people who got together. It
was just a general feeling that
emerged.” -
He mentioned that Pittsburgh
was one of the sites considered.
Dr. Salk said he “will function
as a leader rather than an ad-
ministrator” as head of’ the insti-

Concepts Noted

The developer of the polio vac-
cine discussed some of the think-
ing behind the institute.

“We are concerned with de-
veloping a place where men can
devote themselves uninterrupt-
edly toward the pursuit of
knowledge . . .

- “Science, especially the sciences
dealing with life, knows no
boundaries . . .

“It is an evolution of a. pat-
tern of thought freely and spon-
taneously developed . . .

“The institute would involve
men of certain interests and tal-
ents — physicists who have be-
come biologists, chemists who
have become biologists, biologists
and physicians . . .

“The hope is that a -clearer -un-

derstanding of health will emerge.”

that $145.65 was lost on the

The meeting concluded after a
lengthy discussion concerning the

proposed selling of pencils by SG'

the matter some time earlier_ and
that is was decided that the plan

Soaring Aha ve All

The loss of Dr. Jonas Salk will be a great one to the
_;university. When he goes to_San Diego in 1962, the devel-
~‘oper of the polio vaccine will take with him one of the
greatest scientiﬁc research abilities the world knows.
4' There is no harder, more perservering and more prod-
‘ding worker than Jonas‘ Salk. Research into biological

diseases and attempts to ﬁnd their causes and cures are Dr.
Salk’s life. One of his associates said of him last summer:

    
   
  
  
   
   
   
   
  
  
   
 
    
  
  
    
 
  
  
  
  
   

ihours.”
 This unselﬁshly dedicated work paid off for Dr. Salk,
and more importantly, for mankind, in 1955 when the Pitt
researcher developed a safe, effective and potent polio vac-
cine. '

C Although the public seldom is aware of Dr. Salk’s work
becausehe shuns publicity, he has been working diligently
as ever since his polio success. .

It is the height of research to which he has soared that

now will‘ take him to California. Chancellor Litchﬁeld said
last week, “. . .' we fully appreciate why his career could
carry him beyond this, or any other university to a com-
pletely different kind of institution.”
 In leaving the university and the community, Dr. Salk
is seeking an independent institute, limited, as he said,
only “by the limits of their (its members) imagination and
ingenuity.” V _ . _

The researcher believes much more in the way of bio-
logical study can be accomplished in a separate institution
devoted wholly to the matter. ‘

He is not leaving the university because of lack of
space or -money or differences with any individual. The old
Municipal Hospital was purchased speciﬁcally -for Salk’s
‘purposes. Financed primarily through private foundation
funds. Dr. Salk did not have to rely on the university for
‘money. i ‘ - ~ I . .
Dr..Salk himself emphasized he is leaving for only one
reason: “to take advantage of a unique opportunity” which
. the National Foundation-supported institute in San Diego
offers. , _

‘ ‘Many people are too quick to blame Chancellor Litch-
-ﬁeld and any “fictitious” differences the two men were sup-
- lposed to have had. ‘ .

C ‘There is one major difference in the thinking of the
two men which is summed up in the chancellor’s_state-
ment that he doesn’t think é research institution doesas
;—well “separated from the teaching process!’ Dr. Salk be-
. lieves the opposite. One must not expect the university to

tell Dr. Salk how to think. . T ‘ «

L, Naturally, Dr. Salk’s world—famous research here brings
_ good publicity to this area. But we must. be more broad-
V ,minded and look far beyond such a selﬁsh attitude. Dr. Salk
j _is concerned with developing “a place where men can de-
‘ vote themselves uninterruptedly toward the pursuit of
knowledge.” The hope, the researcher says, is that a clearer
 ‘understanding of health will emerge.

1 If Jonas Salk feels he can accomplish more in a differ-
_ ' ent atmosphere——the one he describes _above—no matter

_ where it is, we must only‘ wish him great success.
His work will beneﬁt no one but all mankind-

.How About You?   n

It Comes in All Colors .‘ . .

A Ubiquitous

By Murray Chass
(This is the ﬁrst of two articles on the subject
of cheating.) -

The discovery of a “ghost-writing” racket in
many of the nation’s colleges has brought cries of
“It can’t happen here” from numerous universities.

Dr. John Geise, assistant chancellor for student
affairs, has said ghost-written ~
theses here are “probably im-  C
possible and certainly improb-
able.” Close faculty supervision
over Ph.D. candidates and the
two—hour oral examination given
by the faculty committee were

against such cheating.

No checks’, however, exist
against cheating on undergrad- 
uate term papers. And in some _, ,
instances the guards against var- -. I _
ious forms of cheating on examinations are shoddy.

‘Whether students at this university pay other
persons to 'write papers "for them is-not known

for sure. If this practice does exist, it is not too .

widespread. Students, however, do have many
channels open to them through which they can
acquire papers. .
For the Purchase Price I r‘ .

Most encyclopedia companies offer a reader

service in which they will send a persdn an entire

paper on any subject in exchange for one of a set
of coupons given to the purchaser‘ of their ency-
clopedias I ~ “ ' '

A second ~method involves a” writers’ bureau,
one of which, located in "Washington, is bold
enough to advertise in college newspapers.’ This
paper, in fact, was guilty of printing such an ad
once.,_ - .. 3/V‘ '

Another channel through which students can

' obtain term papers for the asking is the good old

fraternity ﬁles. Without a doubt this method’ or‘
cheating on term papers in the most. disturbing

A and most disgusting.

These ﬁles are no secret. Fraternity imembers
are asked to submit all.term papers and exams

. to the.ﬁle at the fraternity ‘house. The fraternity

usually places one ‘person in charge of maintaining
the ﬁle. If it ﬁnds‘ its ﬁle becoming depleted, the
fraternity sends'out an appeal to allits members.

If It Isn't

By Joel Filneh

What do you want to be when you grow up, '

little boy? “I want to be an engineer or a chemist
or an English major . .1 .” What? An English
major? Preposterous. How much money can you
make as an English major? What V
can you do besides" teach? Hor-
rors. What a fate! . ~.
“I want to be an engineer.-”
Fine. Then you can stand be-
side your IBM machine and no _t
one can tell the two of you apart,  ' ‘
the only difference being _that
you speak’ and walk and carry’
a slide rule. V

“But I want to beta well-
rounded engineer and go to
school on the Five Year Plan.” _
Now the only difference between you and the IBM
machine is that you can get away from the slide
rule and have broad interests that are stiﬂed with
course limitations and requirements.

“Chemistry?” This is ﬁne. Nothing like it. But
there is one , thing against being a chemist, boy,
and that is you will take too darn many of the. '

 

' “liberal courses” (Bah!)

One Way or the Other

“A mixture?_” Are you kidding? Do you want
to upset the perfectly balanced course and degree
requirements that are carefully set up and ﬁtted
together so that even if you wanted ‘to take a
course to supplement your education and perhaps
vary from the norm you wouldn’t have time or
strength to carry the books? Specialization is ﬁne,
boy. Don’t get carried away with all this talk
of a Whole Education. . .

“Whole Education?”, That is what everyone is
crying about. We are turning out an age of nar-
row-minded, "problem solving individuals(?). A
specialized education is nothing but a factory pro-
cess of piling problems on top of problems on top-
of problems, ad inﬁnitum till the student (2') can
work almost any type of problem in ONE FIELD.

Problem

bold as to make this appeal by postcard.)
Not Only Organized

Of course, individual students also can be
blamed for passing on of term papers and tests.

» Individuals also can be cited for plagiarizing papers

from books and theses found in the library.

Turning to exa'ms,~.we ﬁnd that much of the
blame for cheating can be placed on the faculty.
It is true that students still devise ingenious meth-
ods of bringing notes into a test. The teacher
cannot be expected to police the room in order -to
ﬁnd these cheaters.

The faculty is at fault in another sense, how-
ever. Too many "teachers and too many depart-
ments give the same examinations year after year.
in succeeding
years can obtain either a copy of someone’s an-
swers or even a copy of the test that the teacher
has permitted -the students to keep. .

Departmental exams, inswhich students in a
number of different sections of the same course
take the same test, ‘can be placed in this same
category. , ' '

At faculty which adheres to the above‘practice..-$3
is not a responsible faculty as it deﬁnitely must_b_e. ‘ I

Those teacherp who are- too lazy and who do not
wish to challenge their intelligence in writing new
exams each year‘ are intellectually dishonest.‘
Within the Letter . '. . ' ’
Technically, these teachers are not legally dis-
honest as are the students'wh_o pay to have term
papers written. But academically, they are as
dishonest. They are no better. than the students
who borrow someone else’s term paper and copy it.
When a teacher. discovers that a student has
cheated on a paper or a. test, _a penalty/no doubt

is imposed, most usually in the form of an “F” or C
« a lower grade than the one the student .would

have received. - ‘ T »
There is no‘ penalty, though, for‘ the teacher

who encourages cheating on a test by giving the

same exam over and over again. .

All that has been mentioned above is not,pecul-
iar to the University of Pittsburgh. Universities
throughout the nation have similar troubles. ._

The immediate ‘problem here is ﬁnding ya solu-
tion thatwill end all forms of cheating, on the
part ‘of both the students and the faculty. ‘

These s o l u t-io.n sit will be discussed‘ next
Wednesday.’ -

\

cally the Whole Education is a means to the end

of the specialized’ man. The Whole Education en- . V-
tails nothingmore than a course‘ of studies that '‘
contains subject matter which'will cause a person ‘
to THINK. ' t - ' -

I am not saying that people do not think if they ‘ ;'
don’t study philosophy or literature but that people I

do not think broad enough‘. Their thoughts are on

one subject and even if they know a subject back-

wards and forwards they cannot be part of the

“Whole Man.” I

To See Straight r
»You'see boy, the whole purpose ofthe Whole

Education is to develop a man’s’mind to the point

where he doesn’t have “blinders” on when he looks
around .him. . ' Z ,‘

But why think? The narrow person can get\ a"
job that pays much more and offers more to his
future economic well-being. Why should he take

a course and then graduate with no deﬁnite ttrain- w

ing that Industry will not pay him for. Even if
heenjoys the general education he can be better
paid‘ for thinking narrowly. ‘ 7

Well boy, what it all boils down to, as almost
everything does, is money. If you have it,‘ FINE.
Become a Whole Man. If not, try to study some-
thing that will give you the greatest return for

not enjoy the work, the money is worth it.

’co-operation with Dr. Klaus

7.T"onas, chairman of the. German Section, is sponsoring and

«exhibit on the first ﬂoor‘*of the Cathedral in honor of‘ the

;,eightieth birthday of Carl Van Vechten. .
L‘ -Van Vechten achieved his greatest fame as an author
daring the twenties, at which \time he was widely acclaimed
Lbylthe noted literary figures ot"0~
.!his day.

Van Vechten was born in 1880
at Cedar Rapids, Ohio, and he

U‘attended the University of Chi-
“cago. As early as 1906, he served
"’.'a’s“ assistant music critic of the

New York Times. In 1915 his first
book of essays appeared, entitled

I T‘  “Music and Bad ‘Manners?’

Gains Success
Several years later, he gave up
‘music criticism’, and it was at this
time, in, the twenties, that Va}:
Vechten became one of America’s

‘most successful novelists.

One of Van Vechte_n’s most
,well-known books was entitled
“Nigger Heaven” about which
vWalter White, past NAACP

7 president wrote, “As one race

V ,author to another I send you my.
wzirmest congratulations on the.
natal day of ‘Nigger Heaven’.”
This book was concerned with
{ﬁe race problems 1‘ America. and
was followed by. other Van Vech-
ten novels such as “The Tatooed
Countess,” “The Blind Bow Boy,”
and “Peter Whiffle."
Stops Writing
However, in 1932, when Van
. Vechten was 52. he stopped writ-

‘ing fiction and decided to devote

most of his time to photography,
.-Which, alongside ot‘_music had al-
'—"ways remained one of his major
interests. Van Vechten has photo-
-graphed such notables as Gert-
rude Stein, Franz VVL'l'fCl, Thomas
Mann, Katherine Cornell, and
Marian Anderson.
Some of Van Vechten’s photo-
graphs are at the Sterling Me-

morial Library of Yale Un/iver- ‘W

rsity; others, such as his photo-
graphs of dancers are in the Mu-
seum of Modern Art in New
York. In‘l950 Van Vechten was
appointed Honorary Curator of
the James Weldon Johnson Li-
brary of Negro Art and Letters
at Yale University. r .
Included in the exhibit, located
on the first floor 01‘ the Cathedral,
are numerous letters written ‘to
Van Vechten by well-known
authors. Many of these letters
contain comments about one of
Van Vechten’s best known books
entitled’ “The Tatooed Countess.”
James Branch Cabelll, Somerset
Maugham, and Ellen Glasgow, all
comment favorably concerning
this work.

Five New Records Set

By CHUCK DUNBAR.

Coach Ben Grady’s swim squad returned home from
_NYU last night with a second place in the Eastern Collegiate
Swimming Association Championships and a new record of

,, 4111.1 in the medley relay. However, the Panther tankers

amassed only 67 points as compared to the 127' of the win-

ner, NYU.

I

Of the tenuvarsity swimmers in‘

the competition 9 made the ﬁnals.
Two ﬁrst place honors were ‘won
in the 100-yard butterfly and the
400 medley relay.

C0-captain Len Paganini scored
the victory in the butterfly in
1201.5, depriving NYU’s‘ Stan
Ashare of his bid to become a
triple winner. Paganini also swam

(‘Argon the record—setting relay.

Emert Shines

‘By far the most exciting race
of the meet was the medley relay
on Saturday night. NYU’s team
took an early lead and held it all
the way to the last foot of the
race. Jim Emert as-. anchor man

swam a brilliant race. He started a j
full body’s length behind_ NYU’s
anchor man Tom Keenan, who A

had previously defeated Emert in

_r,the 100 freestyle in NYU record
 time of 52.8, and trailed ,him the

_whole way, yet gaining inch by
inch. ~
In the ﬁnal lap Emert put on.
a tremendous surge’ and_ over-
took Keenan in the last ‘foot of
the race‘, beating him in at scant
two or t?" :ee inches. Incidental-
ly, histime, -51.2, for the last 100
yards ’easily bettered the meet
record for this distance. Besides
Emert the winning relay consist-
ed of Pat Fitzgerald, Jerry Ir-

 win, and Len Paganini.

Friday night’s 400 freestyle re-
lay was perhaps almost as thrill-

- ing. NYU grabbed the lead and

barely _managed to stave off Pan-
, ther attempts to_come from behind

but it took a pool, ESCA, "and

Baseball Picture
2 Looks  righ‘l' For

 1960 Season

By TED COLTON

 
  

v-ezeﬁﬁs

with

§
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIlj.

Spring is here.‘At least that is what the calendar indi-
cates. Baseball time is upon us and if last year is any indica-
tion it should be quite an interesting season for Bobby Lewis’
mitters. Finishing last season with a ﬁne 14-4 record and a
post season bid to the NCAA playoffs, the Panthers can again
look forward to a sound baseball team. I

The.strongest part of the 1960 team will be the inﬁeld.
Although Lewis has lost All-American Shortstop George
Schoeppner he still has three stellar performers in third base-
man Jerry Matuleyic, second baseman Pete Colangelo and
ﬁrst baseman Ron Maser.

The outﬁeld may be weak unless Lewis can come up
with replacements for Bill Kaliden and Herman Joy. The
only returnee is hard hitting Nick Kartsonas. His four
home runs were tops on the Cats last year.

Pitching and catching should be fair if not good. -Fred

Laningham will probably handle the catching’ chores and~

Bob Conti, Dick Wirth and Laren Guthrie will head the
pitching staff. '

Matulevic is a ﬁrst class third baseman. He is outstanding
in the ﬁeld and gets his share of basehits. After leading the
team with a .380 average midway through the season the
young sophomore fell off to below .300 by the end of the year.

i As a junior this year Matulevic should improve on his .
average and be a big asset to the mitters. At second
Lewis has co-captain Colangelo. Although he is not a big

 man with the bat he makes up for it with his ﬁelding.
The Panthers will not see many college second base-
men ﬁeld the way Colangelo does. With Maser ‘guarding
ﬁrst base there won’t be any defense problems on the "
right side of the diamond.  .

The two outﬁeld positions will be hard to ﬁll. ‘One possi-
bility may be Mike Ditka. After spring football practice is
over Ditka is expected to report to the mitters. He is sup-

 posed to be a good baseball player with lots of power.

Girls’ Intermural Team. Beats

4 /Chatham, 19-18, in Close Game

Close scores have caused shaken nerves in basketball
games during the last two weeks. After losing to the Majors
by only a few points, the Intermural team came back to de-
feat Chatham 19 to 18. Chatham took the lead in the ﬁrst

‘quarter 11 to 4 and kept it in the second 15 to 7. C

The score was 15 to 15 at the end of the third quarter,

and the inter-mural team squeezed¢
ahead in the fourth to win by one
point. Sally Waldie again topped
the team with 12 points to her
credit.

'Last Monday the Intermural
team went down to defeat when
it played host to Duquesne. The
score of ,47 to 15 made Duquesne
a decisive winner. However, the
team_ will try again in a re.
match game scheduled for this
Thursday at Duquesne.

In the intramural contest, one

Bobbettes led 5 to 4 after one
quarter.

At the end of two quarters
the score was 8 to 8. Chi Omega
tipped the scale in the third
and went ahead 11 to 10, but
the"Bobb‘ettes reversed the score
and won 16 to 15.

The Women’s Recreational As-
sociation will hold its annual

“I -just can’t say yet,” Lewis reported, “it will depend

During his senior\year in college, math

says. _“I wanted to apply math and statis-

have management responsibilities, too.”

_At a professor’s suggestion, Ken talked
with a Bell System representative and

was “surprised to learn how many practi- ‘

A7-Tie in Contest

A bookplate contest of the Na-
tionality Committees has tempo-
rarily ended in a tie with Don
Cel-mder of the German Commit-
‘tee and Leon Kawicki of the B0-
lish Committee being selected as
the two final contestants. The final
winner will be announced in May.

Bookptl.ate designs were sub-
mitted by students who attempted
to indicate the donors of valuable
collections of books that have
been donated to the University
Library by Nationality Commit-
tees.

Celender’s abstract design de-

’ picts the globe surrounded by the

interchange of ideas and know-
ledge, while the usteropendulum
‘design o£..-Kawicki signiﬁes the
future and knowledge and the
‘symbol of the University with the
traditional flame of enlighten-
ment as the prominent feature.
The two contestants will each
submit a new entry from which
’ the winner will. be selected.
