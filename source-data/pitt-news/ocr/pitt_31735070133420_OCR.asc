VOLUME XCVI NUMBER 78

Mancharged in racially    
motivated student beating

JAMES DEWEESE
Senior Staff Writer

An Etna, Pa., man was formally anaigned yesterday

in the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas on A

charges stemming from his alleged involvement in the
racially motivated assault of a Pitt strident.

David Hardwig, 43, faces three criminal n1isde—
meanor charges for allegedly attacking Hurnair Ahmed
on Sept. 19 as the 22-year-old Pakistani-bom Pitt student
was returning home ﬁom class.

After the incident, Ahmed told police that his attack-
erhadptmchedhimrepeatedly and kickedhim inthe rib
cage and stomach while shouting, “Are you from
Afghanistan?” and threatening to kill him.

Hardwig declined to comment after the anaignment
at the Allegheny County Courthouse, but according to
the criminal complaint ﬁled by Pittsburgh city police,
Hardwig admitted to having been the attacker and signed
a written confession.

The report said Hardwig called police two days after
the event, saying that he wanted to make anangements
to explain his “side of the story” to the authorities.

During a subsequent interview with detectives from
the Zone 6 police station, Hardwig admitted to having
“kicked Ahmed at least once,” the report said’

In the report, Hardwig said that on the afternoon of
the incident, he saw a Middle Eastern man walking on
Dawson Street — Ahmed —— and believed him to be a

P man with whom he had been involved in aﬁght several

months earlier. _

Hardwig also told police he had been drinking at the
time of the incident and felt “enrag ” by the terrorist
attacks that took place on Sept. 11.

The report quoted Hardwig as telling Detective
Scott Evans: “ I f——ed up, Scotty. I lost it.”

The Allegheny County district attomey’s oﬂice has
charged Hardwig with ethnic intimidation and making
terroristic threats — both class one misdemeanors,
which carry possible sentences of 2 1/2 to ﬁve years in
jail — and simple assault, a class two misdemeanor with
a potential jail sentence of one to two years.

Mike Manko, director of public relations for the

Allegheny County district attorney, said that if Hardwig
were convicted on all counts, actual jail time might vary

because criminal charges are sometimes combined for
sentencing purposes.

Hardwig is scheduled to appear before Judge John
Zittolla on Dec. 21 in the Allegheny County Court of
Common Pleas.

‘He just started swinging’

Ahmed said that just after 4_ p.m. he was walking
down the 3600 block of Dawson Street, when he saw a
white man nmning toward him from across the street. As
the man approached, his arms were already swinging
and he was shouting, Ahmed said.

“I didn’t even have time to say anything,” Ahmed
said “He just started swinging.”

According to Ahmed, his attacker repeatedly shout-
ed, “Are you from Afghanistan?” and “I’m gonna kill
you,” while punching and kicking him.

The shouts attracted the attention of another Pitt stu-
dent, who was herself returning home from work

As Hannah Mumma, 23, walked down Atwood
Street, she heard the shouting and rounded the corner,
where she said she saw an athletic white man beating the
hunched-over Ahmed

Ahmed said he tried to ﬂee between blows, but his
attacker pursued him

Posvar Hall’s history ﬁlled with great baseball moments

ERIC LIDJI
Senior Staff Writer

Litchﬁeld’s goal
In the ﬁrst 45 years of its life, Forbes

. Field was home to three World Series games

and countless historic baseball moments.
But the higher—ups in the University
dreamt of expansion, and the plot of land on

Bouquet Street looked just right. On the ﬁrst ‘

day of July 1955, the University decided to
go directly forward in campus improvement.
That day, Dr. Edward H. Litchﬁeld was
appointed as Pitt’s 12th chancellor with
these guidelines from the trustees: You’ll get
$100 million over the next 10 years, free
reign over decision-making and the goal to
“make Pitt one of the world’s ﬁnest schools
of higher education.”

On March 24, 1957, Litchﬁeld pub-
lished a special article in the Pittsburgh Press
titled “Pitt Aims at Greatness,” where he
detailed what led to the decisions of the
trustees, what he felt were inadequacies and
how he was going to change them.

And while the article revolved around
better pay to_attract better professors and
more libraries, there was one paragraph that
would foreshadow the events to come.

“Our aspirations also demand that the
University undertake a thoroughgoing study
of its campus. The University is fractured by
noises and distractions which do not give the
student that opportunity for companionship

with other students, and with faculty, which
is or should be an important part of educa-
tion.” _

Litchﬁeld was ready to move the carn-
pus away from the city.

Ideas for Oakland

Max Abramowitz was an architect and
plarmer whose ﬁrm had credit for creating
such buildings as Rockefeller Center, the

United Nations Building and Pittsburgh’s ’

Alcoa Building. In the early months of 1955,
before Litchﬁeld was appointed but after he
was aware that the position was his, he
obtained permission to begin early stages of
planning,and that  planning led
him to Abramowitz. .

Abramowitz was intrigued and came on
board as a consultant. Itbecame, habitual for
him to come up with enormous plans for
restructuring. He wanted to make bridges
over the central. roads, or have Forbes
Avenue run underground. Most of hispideas
were ludicrous, but in 1958, one of them
stuck — buy Forbes Field from the city,
build a new stadium on Pittsburgh’s North
Shore, tear down Forbes Field and reroute
Forbes Avenue and Bigelow Boulevard. On
Sept. 9 of that year, the plan was made pub-
lie in the.Pittsburgh Press.

Despite the unpopularity of the idea,
work began on bringing it to fruition. A few
weeks later, on Nov. 29, the Pittsburgh Press
printed a story titled “Bucs Stay As Tenants

For 5 Years.” The article detailed Pitt’s pur-
chased of Forbes Field for “less than $2 rr1il-
lion,” and said that “the Pirates will continue
to use the ball park in Oakland until the pro-
posed‘North Side stadium is available, pos-
sibly within ﬁve years.” Litchﬁeld wanted to
make it very clear '

Forbes Field. That event — a Jehovah’s
VV1tness Assembly with some 20,000 people
on hand the Sunday that it ended — was
Forbes Field’s last ever. 4

was approved and

In 1960, the Pirates won the World
Series against the Yankees with a home run
in the last inning of the seventh game from
Bill Mazeroski’s bat. The plaque on the side-
walk of Roberto Clemente Drive reads,
“This marks the spot where Bill Mazeroski’s
home run ball cleared the left. centerﬁeld
wall of Forbes Field’ on Oct.13, 1960, there-
by winning the World Series for the
Pittsburgh Pirates.” 1

It continues, “The historic hit came in
the ninth inning of the seventh game, to beat
the New York Yankees by a score of 10- .”

the story,‘ it'*‘can be seen
today in the expanse that once was Forbes
Field. ‘In 1976, the University ended an
expansion of that area that had begim in

1967, and by 1978, the colossus of Forbes .

Quad was furnished.

Check out the Quad’s speciﬁcations:

It cost $38.26 million to build and has a
ﬂoor space of 744,695 square feet. That’s an
area larger than the ﬂoor space of the
Cathedral of Ieaming. There are 574 acade-
mic ofﬁces, 30 seminar rooms and three lec-
ture halls. You can walk down a mile of cor-
ridors, ﬁve miles of partitions or park in one
of 435 parking spaces. Today it is home to
more than 3,000 faculty members.

‘But it’s not Forbes Quad. '

Last year, in a ﬁnal affair of confusion,
the name was changed to Wrlliarn Wesley
Posvar Hall in honor of Pitt’s former chan-
cellor who passed away this summer.

Anti—Muslim attacks increase here, elsewhere

Assault, page 1

Mumma, at 5 feet, 105 pounds, didn’t hesitate to get
involved, which she said was “just sort of instinct.”

Mumma said she had been watching the news every day
and had heard of a rise in hate crimes against Muslims and
Arabs aﬁer the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11.

“I was just kind of disgusted and appalled at that kind of
behavior,” she said.

Ahmed said, “A girl came out of nowhere and tried to
get in between us.” But apparently Mumma only succeeded
in slowing the attack momentarily.

Mumma said the attacker quickly pushed her out of the
way. ,

Ahmed said his attacker continued beating him until a
man from a nearby construction site pulled the attacker off
him. .

By the time police arrived, the attacker had left the
scene. According to the police report, officers later spoke
with Dean Brammer, the foreman of a construction site near-
by on Dawson Street, who said the description of the attack-
er ﬁt that of a former employee. ,

The police report indicated that when Hardwig called to
speak with police, he said he had spoken with Bramrner and
learned that he was the subject of a police investigation.

Never like this before _
Ahmed said he is no stranger to anti-Muslim prejudice.
“There’s always been a big huge thing with Muslims,”
Ahmed said. “ButI just never had stuﬂ° like this happen.”
Despite rising fears of anti—Muslirn attacks after Sept
11, Ahmed said that on the day he was attacked, he wasn’t

really frightened. _ ,
Ahmed said, “I really didn’t think about ituntil it hap-
Wn 7’ . ' .

, For a few weeks following the crime, Ahmed said he felt
a heightened awareness of his surroundings. As time passed,
he said, the wony and fear began to subside. But Ahmed said
the potential for racially motivated violence might’ increase
with an escalation in the ongoing war in 

. “If it ever turned into a world war, I’m~ guessingit would
be a lot worse,” Ahmed said.

The aftermath ‘

While the current conﬂict in Afgha’nistan has not
reached the status of world war, anti-Muslim hate crimes
continue to threaten Americans of Middle—Eastem descent in
Pittsburgh and throughout the country.

Kadir Gunduz, director of the Islamic Center of
Pittsburgh in Oakland, expressed concern that Americans
generally consider Muslims to be foreign, even more so now
with the ongoing conﬂict in Afghanistan.

“There’s a tendency to see Muslims as exotic,” Gunduz
said. “[But] these people live here. They’re born here.”

According to Gunduz, this perceived isolation from
mainstream American society has partially contributed to the
rise in racially motivated crime across the country.

The Islamic Center maintains a Website with a brief p
description of each of the complaints of intimidation or hate
crimes they have registered since Sept. 11. As of Nov. 22, the
Center has received 32 separate reports. But Gunduz point-
ed out that many incidents go unreported.

The majority of the incidents involve verbal assaults,
and -few reach the severity of the physical assault against

\

  Gunduz. As time has passed, Gunduz

said, complaints have begrmv to taper oﬂ.

 Eric Shakir, a staff attorney for the Council on American
Islamic Relations in Washington, D.C., said his organization
has received a steady stream of complaints, but that the
nature of complaints has changed over time.

Shakir said that initially his organization received many
complaints of violence and property damage, but that more
recently he has witnessed a shift to workplace discrimination
and airline proﬁling. ° ' _

According to its Web site, www.cair-net.org, the council
has received ’ 1 ,452 reports nationwide, including public
harassment, physical assault, hate mail, property damage and
intimidation by law enforcement agencies. A 1’ "

A show of support

But since Sept. 11, the Islamic Center has received only
one “funny” call, Gunduz said. He added that in the days
immediately following Sept; 11, more than 300 people called
or stopped» by to express support for the Islamic Center and
its mission of promoting anawareness of the Muslim faith.

Gunduz said he hopes to build on this support. He said
the center is a three-prong education effort to explain the ide-
ological underpinnings of Islam, participate in interfaith
activities and support anti—racism organizations and causes.

In the meantime, Ahmed said he believes education will
play a role in eliminating future conﬂict both at home and
abroad, saying that many Americans “don’t even know the
Taliban’s the enemy.”

“[People] are thinking we’ll just have a war and this will I

end,” Ahmed said. “Ifpeople really want to understand stuff,
it’s important to understand the roots.” ‘

Pittranked 11th worst for racial interaction

LINDSAY BANE
Staff Writer

Pitt was ranked as the 11th worst uni-
versity for racial and social class interaction
in the 2002 edition of the Princeton
Review’s college guidebook, ‘The Best
331 Colleges,” published in August.

According to Princeton Review, that rank- ’

ing is based on surveys of thousands of stu-
dents across the country.

But University spokesman Robert Hill
said that ranking,“disguises the fact that
students found the campus gorgeous and
historic,” and that some of the students sur-
veyed said the residence halls are “great,”
or called “Pittsburgh and culture synony-
mous.” .

Black Action Society president Dionne
Hayden said that Pitt has a long way to go
before it can be considered a healthy cli-
mate for black students in particular.

‘”Ihere’s still a lot of areas where
blacks suffer on campus,” she said:adding
that she would not recommend Pitt to a
prospective incoming black student. '

A report by Pitt’s Oﬂice of Affirmative
Action, released July 2001,‘ documented
thatout of the 2,493’ students admitted to
the University in 1994, 39 percent of 237

, black freshmen graduated by the year

2000.

During this same six-year time span,‘

14 percent of Pitt’s seven American-Indian
or Alaskan natives graduated, 69 percent of
Pitt’s 91 Asian Paciﬁc or islanders graduat-
ed, 51 percent of 39 Hispanics graduated
and 63 percent of 2,052 whites graduated.
Hayden said that retention is one of the
major problems for black students at Pitt A
lack of ﬁnancial aid, poor communication
between the administration. and black stu-
dents, poor relationships with teachers and
a lack of involvement with the city and

wore a white hat and dark clothing during
therobbery. - .

The alert requests any infonnation

— regarding the robbery be relayed to Pitt

police by phone at (412) 624-2121 or via e-
mail at police@pitt.edu

Pitt police, in conjunction with the city
police’s robbery squad, are continuing their
investigations. _

“I hope people aren’t complacent
[about crime],” Delaney said “One [rob-
bery] is too many.”

University are among the many reasons
why black students leave the University,
she said.

“Black students are recruited heavily

, from [Washington,] D.C., New York and

[Philadelphia], where there is a lot of enter-
tainment,” Hayden said. She explained that
when these students get to Pittsburgh,
many of them feel that there is nothing to
do. '

“People don’t always leave because
they don’t have the grades or they don’t
have the money,” she said. “Sometimes
they just don’t like it.”

But according to Hill, the same
Princeton Review researchers that released

the racial and class interaction ranking also
found Pitt “so compelling that [they] wrote
‘Hail to Pitt,”’ adding that the three words
encapsulated “the general sentiment about
the very affordable Pitt.” '

To stay or not to stay

One north Philadelphia native, who
requested anonymity, was admitted to Pitt
last year and said that she was unsatisﬁed
with Pittsburgh and the University through-
out her ﬁrst semester.

“The atmosphere was really corny. 2

There was nothing for me to do socially,”
she said. “Pittsburgh shuts down early, but
in Philly tlrere’s always something to do.”

She said she resolved to move back to
Philadelphia and transfer to Temple
University.

But by second semester, the student
changed her mind and decided to stay at
Pitt.

“I pulled myself together and came out
of my shell. I knew that it wasn’t goodfor
me to go back home where all my friends
are’ doing nothing with their lives.”
Transferring is no longer a consideration,
she said. .

V In both her freshman and sophomore
years, the student said that she has been

Some students say black retention is poor here

Retention, page 5

involved in FOCUS, Facilitating Opportunities and
Climate for Underrepresented Students, an organization

that Hayden said aims to pair undergraduate minority '

freshmen with minority professors, graduate students and
upper-level undergraduate students for mentoring purpos-

But, Hayden said, FOCUS experiences difficulty in
ﬁnding professors and graduate students to participate in
the program.

In another report released by the Office ofAflirmative
Action in July 2001, black faculty made up 3 percent of the
3,053 full-time faculty members in fall 2000. Black gradu-
ate students in fall 2000 made up 5 percent of the 7,058
total.

Historical struggle

The shortage of black faculty and graduate students
within the University population has concemed black stu-
dents for more than three decades.

At September’s Indaba, an armual BAS event, BAS
co-founder Dr. Curtiss Porter told the story of his genera-
tion’s attempt to improve the University’s environment for
black students.

In 1968, BAS created a list of demands to be met by .

University administrators that included resources and
opportunities now existent at Pitt, such as the Africana
studies program and the African American Collection at
Hillman Library, but also the recruitment of more black
students, faculty and administration. , .

Porter said that to attain these things and to be recog-
nized as the oﬁicial representative body of the black stu-
dents on campus, members of the young BAS seized the
University computer room.

The computers were programmed so that a keystroke
could erase all data in the University’s computer system if
the administration refused to act on the list of demands,
Porter said. Chancellor Wesley Posvar agreed soon there-
after to negotiate. 9

But the second of ﬁve total points demanded in 1968 '

has yet to come to fruition. It stated: “We demand that the
University of Pittsburgh double its black enrolhnent begin-
ning September 1968 and to continue each year until the
black students compose at least 20 percent of the total pop-
ulation of the University.”

In fall 2000, black students constituted 8 percent of the
student body, as reported by Pitt’s Office of Affirmative
Action in July 2001.

Dr. Jack Daniel, also _a BAS co-founder and Pitt’s
highest-ranking black administrator as the vice provost for
academic affairs and interim dean of students, said earlier
this year in an interview that the 330 black freshmen in
2001 are the “largest current African-American freshman
class in the University of Pittsburgh.”

“The recruitment is good,” Hayden said. “It’s just that
once you get the students up here, they have to leave.”

A center for solidarity

Possible solutions to foster a more comfortable atmos-
phere for black students include the creation of a black cul-
tural center. The United Black Cultural Front is a student
organization that aims to establish this center.

According to UBCF leader Bola Fakinlede, black cul-
tural centers at other universities, such as Penn State
University, University of North Carolina and Purdue
University, have been correlated to improved G,P.AS and
retention rates. .. ' A

At one of the organization’s meetings last month,
Fakinlede said that the cultural center would promote soli-
darity and be a place where black students could visit when

they need to be around people who understand what
they’re going through. “Community members will also be
able to come and link up with students and address con-
cerns,” she said.

According to Sade Olowude, the fund—raising chair of
UBCE some students worry that the center would create
segregation at the University. But, she said, “The center
would only help Pitt increase numbers.” _

The student’s movement
' In an effort to improve University conditions for all
historically underrepresented students, Resolution 0009
was introduced by Student Government Board members
Michelle Agostini and Kerianne Ludwig in October.
Though the board did not pass Resolution 0009, it has
since formed a committee to ﬁrrther explore the possibili-
ty of a task force that would enable SGB, with the help of
Daniel and Pitt’s student aﬁairs division, to assign a num-
ber of students to a permanent recruitment and retention
task force. '

The task force’s responsibilities would include .

reviewing existing University programs that assist in the
monument and retention of historically underrepresented

students, determining whether any of these programs have ’

overlooked historically underrepresented communities
and making a public report that would list the task force’s
ﬁndings and include suggestions for the improvement of
these programs.

“We know there’re problems,” SGB member Lonny
Fish said. “We’re going to ﬁnd out why.” V

Fish said that guidelines for the task force should be
completed by mid—January and will be followed by the
selection of the task force members, which will consist of
a majority of historically underrepresented students.

This is only one of the initiatives SGB has taken to
improve University conditions for minority students.

Last spring, SGB and BAS collaborated on av10-point
proposal to create a better climate for minority students at
the University and ﬁght racial proﬁling as a part _of
Resolution 0001.

The points included the development of a data collec-
tion system thatewould document Pitt police‘ encounters
with students, indicating any existence of racial proﬁling,
the distribution of literature informing students of their
rights and the modiﬁcation of Pitt police business cards to
include contact information for the chief of police and vice
provost on the reverse side of the card. .

After SGB passed the resolution, a series of meetings
conducted by Daniel were held between Universityleaders
and student representatives, including former SGB mem-
bers Jay Dworin and Sara Dadlani. The points were agreed
upon and Dworin said that he was “relatively satisﬁed”
with the outcome of the meetings. _

But the satisfaction was short lived and soon negotia-
tions were back to square one. Dworin said that because of
last surnrner’s dismissal of Dean of Students Sharon
Johnson, nothing resulted in the promises for action by
administration.

“We were told that Dr. Daniel no longer had control
over the four key points we had remaining and the decision
was made by Executive Vice Chancellor Jerome Cochran
that these things were not going to happen,” Dworin said.

In a later meeting attended by Dadlani, Daniel,
Dworin and Cochran, who is_also Pitt’s chief ﬁnancial oﬁ‘i-
cer and who oversees the police department, said
Cochran denied that racial proﬁling is a problem at the
University and that the steps detailed in the 10 points
should not be taken because they might cause people to
think that racial proﬁling is an issue.

Dworin said he then requested that Cochran release
statistics showing that racial proﬁling wasn’t an existing

problem at Pitt, but according to Dworin, Cochran refused
to do that V » ’

Cochran did not return phone calls over a period of a
week requesting comment.

The 10-point _ negotiations. with administration coin-
cided with a racial proﬁling rally‘ that featured Rev. Al
Sharpton, held on campus last spring. '

“We had the lead story on every single news charmel,
both newspapers and The Pitt News,” Dworin said.

“The administration looked us in the face and said one
thing one day, and now the press is gone and they’re doing
something diﬂerent because their image can’t be tarnished
now like it could’ve been,” he said. 

Dworin said that the promises to ﬁrlﬁll the 10 points
last spring and summer are empty promises, “similar to the
promises that were made in the 1960s.”

‘The administration has a tactic. of appeasing students
just long enough until they graduate,” Dworin said. “Part

. of this might be our fault as students, that we don’t know
tactically how to keep our movements going past when we

leave-‘’ 8

‘ To accomplish the goals that BAS students have ,

invested time and effort in for more than 30 years, Dworin
said he plans to sit down with a group of students and
review BAS’s current position and tactics before he gradu-
ates next semester.

“The times are changing in this country. The ability to
keep a movement going is probably better than it’s been in
10 or 15 years,” he said. .

It’s our favorite time of year...

Two more days of classes to go. Then
comes along the dreaded word, a word this
newspaper prints only with hesitation for
fear of mass campus hysteria when eyes
spot it on the page.

OK, take a deep breath. We’re going to
say it. Next week is ﬁnals week.

That’s right, it’s the culmination of the
semester. Four months of hard work, some-
times more than half your grade for a
course, comes together.

Some seniors are probably reading this
and saying, “Finals? Ha! No classes. That
means I can sleep until 4, wake up still hung
over and score A’s on the ﬁnals for which I
decide to show up. Cool!”

But freshmen are likely having the

opposite reaction —— that is, if they are read-
ing this and are not holed up in their rooms
trembling in fear of what to expect.

Well, if any senior or any freshman tries
to tell you these bipolar reactions to ﬁnals,
don’t listen to them. The appropriate
response to ﬁnals week is somewhere in the
middle.

Finals are your chance to really prove
yourself. Screwed up on the midterm?
There’s always the ﬁnal for redemption —
both of yourself and your grade.

And thankfully, plenty of groups are
out there to help make ﬁnals week less
stressful. For example, Pitt Progranr"
Council will be distributing ﬁnals survival
packs and providing other goodies both day
and night — including extended study hours

in the William Pitt Union.

Student government is offering‘ ﬁee
food during study breaks.

Hillman Library will remain open 24/7
from 9 am. this Saturday to 10 p.m. on
Friday, Dec. 14. And don’t forget about the
24-hour computer labs.

Perhaps if the weather forecasts are
wrong and next week is like yesterday, you
could even take your beach towel out to the

Cathedral lawn and admire the holiday dec-

orations on the buildings surrounding you
while you study.

Upperclassmen should also help out
those freshmen that you know. Make sure
they take ﬁnals seriously but that they don’t
necessitate a trip to Western Psychiatric
Institute and Clinic. Tell them what you
learned to survive ﬁnals every semester.

And just remember that on Dec. 15, it
will all be over. For some, it will be more
over than others, as that is the oﬁicial date
for seniors graduating in December.

We congratulate these students on a job ‘

well done.

Unfortimately for these graduates, they
will have to wait until April to have any sort
of official ceremony, and will not receive
quite the hoopla their April-commencing

counterparts will. That should change. VVith _

the new Petersen Events Center opening
this spring, the University should begin
holding oﬂicial December graduation cere-
monies there, just like it will for April grad-

Don’t fall into the trap

The retention and graduation stats
for black students are appalling.
According to Pitt’s Office of
Affirmative Action, only 56.7 percent
of black students who entered in fall of
1995 remained enrolled, compared with

. 70.4 percent of white students.

More strikingly, the same class
graduated only 23.2 percent of black
students, compared with 40.7 percent
of white students. This per- _
centage moves up to 39.3 —
percent for blacks graduat-
ing after ﬁve years, but is ,
still disappointing com-
pared. to 61.5 percent for
white students. ,

There are many rea-
sons — both legitimate and
foolish — why students
don’t make it to graduation
or even their. second

I’m not proud of this. I look back
on those times and can’t help saying to
myself, “What were you thinking?”

I very easily could have been a sta- I
, tistic. ,I’m truly blessed to be in my

fourth year approaching graduation in
spring.

My hard head didn’t get the point,
though, until I ended up in jail in the
fall semester of mysecond year. I dis-

appointed both my family
and my friends back home.
I didn’t even know my
friends cared until I told
. them about my arrest. ‘
One of my closest

no less — broke it down for
me. He told me how I was
the only one from our circle
to make it to college and
remain. I remember his

semesters. Certain extenu-
ating circumstances make it impossible
for students to continue. ,.

My issue, though, is with black
male students on this campus.

I came to Pitt with many bad habits.

I brought demons to school with me,
such as alcoholism and other substance

' abuse. I came into Pitt not only as a stu-

dent but also as an unsavory character
who had little regard for other people’s
feelings.

It wasn’t the way I was raised, but
it was how I allowed myself to grow
up.

I jumped from girl to girl at Pitt and
I hurt many feelings. In my first year I
served on Black Action Society’s steer-
ing committee but was a terrible model
for other black students. I engaged in
illicit practices that seemed to be the
program of almost every other black
male student I had encountered at Pitt.

words verbatim, “Why you
up there actin’ wild? You ‘posed to be a
student.”

I went to jail for something petty,
which I took as a message from God
saying, “I could have put you in jail for
something more serious you were
doing, and if you don’t get it together, I
will.”

I hope it doesn’t take going to jail
or even dropping out of school for
black male students to get their acts
together. Our main purpose here is to.
obtain a degree.

I know many black guys who
smoke weed and drink all day, who
play Sony~PlayStation like they’re get-
ting paid hourly for it, who spend so
much time playing pool and ping-pong
you’d think that was their major and
who put more energy into being a pimp

What should happen to John Walker?

With the Taliban crumbling during the last few
weeks, the question has arisen over what to do with
captured fighters. That question is already complicat-
ed, but it becomes even more so in the case of a cap-
tured fighter calling himself Abdul Hamid.

Abdul Hamid is not one of the fundamentalist
Afghan Muslims who joined the Taliban.

fighters, as long as they were not affiliated with_ al
Qaeda. _ ‘

But yet the British intelligence report linking the
organization to the terrorist attacks of Sept. ll also

said it and the Taliban are inexorably connected. So g

where do we draw the line? Or do we?
Will the United States allow other

He is not one of the many Arabs,

Afghanistan to fight for what many con-
sidered a “pure Islamic state.”

Rather, he is a 20-year-old American
named John Walker Lindh.

According to the Dec. 4 Washington
Post, Walker (he uses his mother’s maid-
en named most frequently) was a middle-
class kid raised as a Catholic in the sub-
urbs of Washington, D.C., and San

former Taliban to come to the country, or
will there be a strict “No ex-Taliban” sign
at our borders? If so, should Walker be
allowed to return to his previous life in
the United States? He too fought for the
Taliban.

Is Walker even still a citizen of ‘the
United States? After all, he joined a for-
eign army that later became an enemy of
the United States. ' '

An American passport says that a

Francisco. He converted to Islam at the
age of 16 and apparently joined the Taliban six
months ago after traveling to Pakistan to study.

He told CNN that his “heart became attached” to
the Taliban’s teachings.

Walker is sure to become a celebrity in the next
few weeks as American tries to figure out what made
him decide to fight for a group that hates the United
States. ’

The question of what should happen to him will
come up rather frequently as well. ’

Should the United States treat him as a prisoner
of war and let him return home without a trial, as the
rules of war dictate, when the war ends?

Friends and family describe Walker as a spiritu-
al, devout young man. One could argue that he was a
naive young kid who became brainwashed. So
should he return to his parents?

But then what about other Taliban fighters?
Many of them are younger than he is. Were they
brainwashed? Should they be allowed to return to
their parents too? We traditionally repatriate soldiers
we capture during wartime, as long as they are not
involved-in war crimes. ‘

Quite possibly we will do the same with Taliban

. person can lose citizenship for serving in
a foreign army, but only “voluntarily and with the
intention to relinquish U.S. citizenship.”

Since the United States never recognized the ‘

Taliban as the legitimate government of Afghanistan,
did he really join the army of a foreign country, or
did he simply join an organization?» Should he still
lose his citizenship because he fought for the de facto
government of a foreign country? ‘

And does his ﬁghting for an army that became an
enemy of the United States’ mean that he had the
intention of relinquishing his citizenship? Can a per-
son inherently be a citizen of one country and fight
for its enemy?

Would he then face charges of treason, a capital
offense? . .

If so, where and how would he be tried? Should
he be returned to the United States to face trial before
a jury of his peers in a civili_an court? '

And was he really a traitor? Professor Peter Spiro
of Hofstra University Law School told the Post in a
Dec. 5 article that treason is extremely hard to prove
because the question of intent is relevant.

Did Walker have treasonable intent?

Spiro also said that proving treason‘ is difficult

without a formal declaration of war.

Currently no evidence exists that Walker killed
any American soldiers or had anything to do with ter-
rorism. But President George W. Bush said that the
Taliban are‘terrorists because they harbored Osama
bin Laden. So is Walker a terrorist by association?

If so, should he face another kind of justice?

On Nov. 13, Bush signed an executive order
authorizing military tribunals to trysuspected terror—,
ists —— but only if they are not U.S. citizens.

If Walker loses his citizenship, should he then
face a tribunal? In 1942 the Supreme Court allowed
a militaryktribunal to try a naturalized American citi-
zen who had spied for Nazi Germany. That happened
because the Supreme Court said the man gave up his
citizenship by becoming an enemy agent.

But what about Walker?

American University law -professor Ira Robbins
said in a Dec. 5 Washington Post article that it would
likely take a conviction for treason to.strip Walker of

his American citizenship.

So in other words, he would have to be convict-
ed of treason in a domestic court before he could face
a tribunal.

If Walker goes before a civilian court, then why
shouldn’t any other Taliban or al Qaeda member? Do
we then apply a different standard to an American
citizen fighting for the Taliban than we would for a
non-citizen? ' '

We are-, according to our government, in a new
kind of war, and Walker’s is a new kind of case.‘None
of our previous paradigms for dealing with either
criminals or enemy combatants can fully apply in
this case.

But we as a society have to figure out something.
We have to decide what to do when one of our ﬂock
goes astray. Until we know more about his case, we

. have to avoid making a determination as to his status.

~ ..We must also avoid hypocrisy by not making
snap judgments about other Taliban.

These very same guys will come to
me when facing expulsion and in all
seriousness will ask me if I think Dr.
Jack Daniel will give them a scholar-

before you even get to that point of des-

College isn’t a game. I know a lot

Even those active in organizations

need to be wary. I’ve seen brothers

that they end up neglecting their school
work and ﬂunk_out. I

That’s not the revolution. For all
the struggle and protest that occurs on

Pitt defense d

KEVIN NASH
Staff Writer

Defense was the major factor in
the men’s basketball team’s 77-55
victory last night over St. Francis at
Fitzgerald Field ' House. Guard.
Brandin Knight, along with center
Toree Morris, led the team in
rebounds with six. Guard Julius
Page was right behind with five
rebounds. , '

“I thought our defense again
was good,” said .head_ coach Ben
Howland, “especially for the first
25 minutes of the game.”

The defense held the Red Flash, .
to 18 points in the first half, and the,
Panthers also outrebounded the Red
Flash 23-9 in -the first half. .

They‘ took advantage of St.
Francis’s lack of size. The size dis-
crepancy was most notable at the
guard position, with Knight at 6
feet, Jaron Brown at 6 feet 4 inches,
and Page at 6 feet 3 inches respon-
sible for guarding Red Flash guards
Dan Swoger and Rahsaan Benton.

Despite Swoger and Benton
being listed on the roster as being 5
feet 10 inches and 5 feet 11 inches
respectively, they appeared smaller
standing next to Knight, who is the
closest to their heights out of all of
Pitt’s guards.

Swoger had a quiet first half but

added four three-pointers in the sec-
ond half. Swoger finished with 14
points and Benton added two.

points off of 26 assists.

Pitt opened up the second half
with nine unanswered points. The
Red Flash did not get on the score-
board until 3 minutes, 16 seconds
into the second half.

Pitt did this to St. Francis all
night, outscoring the Red Flash for
minutes at a time.

“Every night we try to come in
and pressure teams with our
defense. As long as we play
defense, we will be OK,” Page said.
“We came out to be aggressive.”

Knight and Page both had five
offensive rebounds. Pitt finished
with 14 offensive rebounds overall.

“I think it is because everybody
goes to the glass,” Knight said. “I
get the dirty rebounds.”

Knight and Page also led the
Panthers in» scoring. Knight and
Page had 16 and 13 points, respec-
tively. Knight added 11 assists for
the double-double.

“I have to thank my teammates
for all the open looks I’ve been get-
ting,” Knight said. “They have been
screening very well.”

Page opened the game with a
three-pointer and scored seven of
Pitt’s first nine points. He proceed-
ed to score six more points during

There are plenty of excuses that could have
been offered, but Traci Waites was not about to
make any. '

“There’s only one thing we didn’t do,” head
coach Waites said. “We shot the ball poorly.”

This was the only explanation for why the Pitt
women’s basketball team dropped its Big East
opener last night to Virginia Tech, 83-64, at
Fitzgerald Field House.

The Panthers shot just 36 percent from the field
and were four of 17 from behind the arc. On the
other side, the Hokies were hot all night, shooting
56 percent for the game.

But the final margin is deceiving because for
the entire first half, it was a back and forth game in
which the Panthers held a lead _at three separate
times‘. Both teams were aggressive early on, and the
Pitt defense applied the necessary pressure to keep
the game close.

The Hokies took a slim three-point lead into the
locker room, but less than two minutes into the sec-
ond half a basket by Mandy Wittenmyer tied the
game at 36. Virginia Tech answered back by open-
ing up a lead that the Panthers never recovered
from. With just over 7 1/2 minutes left to play, the
Hokies went up by 11 and continued to extend their
lead as hopes of a Panther comeback disappeared.

“We just had a breakdown of communication,”
Wittenmyer said of the second half demise of the
Panthers. “We just fell apart at the wrong time. We
let them take a lead and didn’t take advantage of the
opportunities that we had.”

Waites believes that her team may have been
affected by the recent road trip to Arizona, which
forced the Panthers to practice for only an hour and
a half because of fatigue that may have carried over
onto the court.

“We knew we could play Virginia Tech but the
momentum was gone,” Waites said. “Virginia Tech
played well, they‘ played a smart game and they are
a seasoned team.”

College football is simply  whack

The word of the day is whack.
The Heisman Trophy candidates

is only a sophomore and no sopho-
more. has ever won this prestigious
award.

are whack. The Bowl
Championship 0 Series sys-
tem is whack. The upsets in
the last two weeks are
whack. And Penn State get-
ting three votes in the
coach’s poll is very whack.
First, let’s start with the
Heisman Trophy candidates
Joey Harrington of Oregon,
Ken Dorsey of Miami, Eric
Crouch of Nebraska and
Rex Grossman of Florida.
What do you notice

    

Slrrs VI

Brian Goldman

‘ I also believe
Harrington should. be a
ﬁnalist for the Heisman.
He has thrown for 2,415
yards and 23 touchdowns.
Harrington also led his
team to a PAC-10 champi-
onship and. most likely a
berth in the Fiesta Bowl.
Maybe his 10—story mural
on the side of a building
in New York City this
summer wasn’t a ﬂuke.

about those four? No, they

don’t make bone-crushing hits or eye-
popping moves, but they all throw the
ball for their respective teams. They
are all quarterbacks. -

All four of these quarterbacks are
very deserving of the Heisman — each
have compiled more than 2,000 net
yards and accounted for more than 20
touchdowns. Yet I think it should be
possible to narrow one specific posi-
tion to the top two or three best candi-
dates.

To me, Grossman is the front-run-
ner of the four. He has more passing
yards (3,896) and more touchdowns
passes (34) than his three competitors.
His age is his one downfall. Grossman

The Heisman commit-
tee announced yesterday that they are
considering a fifth candidate for the
award. I think a good choice for this
award would be Julius Peppers of
North Carolina. Once he said that he
would be leaving school early to enter
the NFL draft, he was immediately
predicted to go No. 1 in the draft for a
good reason. ‘

Pitt got a good look at Peppers’
dominating defensive skills last year,
and this year he just got even better.

He is one of those guys who will make 1

your jaw drop with every hit he makes,
and I believe he deserves to be in New
York as a finalist.

But the Heisman committee over-

looks Peppers because his team isn’t a
premier team in the NCAA. And that
brings me to my next point.

What is up with this BCS bologna?

All right, Miami is the Rose Bowl, '

that’s obvious. If Tennessee wins
Saturday over LSU, they will earn a
spot in the Rose Bowl. But why? Did
they do anything better than Oregon,
or even Nebraska? All three of those
teams had equally hard schedules in
my mind, and only lost one game to
top—notch teams. . .

And if Tennessee, loses to LSU,
then we have problems if we didn’t‘
already. The same problem as last
year’s Miami-Florida State battle-for
the title game will occur between
Colorado and Nebraska. -

Most likely Nebraska (Nu. 3 in the
BCS poll) would be invited to the
Rose Bowl if Tennessee loses, but
there is a slight possibility Colorado
(No.14 in_the BCS poll)_could slip into
the Rose Bowl. Colorado beat
Nebraska _two weeks ago, so they
proved to the world they are better
than Nebraska. -

So what’s the solution?

Pick Oregon to go to the Rose
Bowl. They’ve only had one loss,
unlike Colorado, and it was to a great
Stanford team. And they ‘also won
their conference’, unlike ‘Nebraska.

Now on to my final thought. Why
in the blue hell did Penn State get three
votes in the coaches’ poll? Let’s take
away for a minute this school’s hatred
toward Penn State. .

There is no logical reason to give a
5-6 team three Votes. Not like Pitt
deserves votes yet, but even: the
Panthers have a better record.

I recently received an e-mail from

a lawyer in Washington, D.C., who
justified Penn’ State’s votes by putting
down Pitt. He said that Penn State had
a tough schedule and Pitt’s schedule

~was weak. He said, “I’m surprised

[Pitt] didn’t have the Methodist Day
Camp on their schedule.”

He continued to put down the fact
that Pitt is even in a bowl, saying,
“even [a bowl] that a team with some
self respect wouldn’t be caught dead
playing.” .

I say to him that any bowl is better

~ than no bowl. Hail to Pitt, and let’ s go

down to Orlando and beat North
Carolina State. Then we will see who
deserves votes in the coaches’ poll.

Brian Goldman is a columnist for The
Pitt News and would like lots of feed-
back from his readers to send to this
incompetent guy that is just like every
other Penn State alum and thinks Penn
State rules the world.

Tennessee will be smelling roses after victory

"I know I’ve been gone for awhile,
but after e-mails and some pleading
phone calls, I’ve decided to check in
with a look at this weekend’s games,
plus give you some bowl game .pontif1-
cations for Monday’s issue.

I last left you with my first sub-par
weekend of the season as Temple had
the nerve to beat West Virginia, Cal
covered against Stanford and Alabama
beat the daylights out of Auburn. I
promise I’ll never take Alabama again.

Boston College and Florida came
through in their games against Rutgers
and Florida State to hand the comer a 2-
3 weekend. My overall record comes to
28-18-1. I must warn you that I really
don’t have a great feeling for any of the
three games this weekend but I will do
my best to handicap them for you.

The Panthers’ Jaron Brown puts in two points as Pitt defeated St. Francis 77-55
last night at Fitzgerald Field House to ‘improve to 7-1 on the season. '

Penn State on weekend  

Men, page 15

“I’m trying to get my shot
back,” Page said. “It’s not like I’m

, not confident. In the first half, I was

relaxed.”’

St. Francis head coach Bobby
Jones said he felt Pitt’s team was
better this year than they were last
year. . '

Jones told his team at the six-

minute mark that their goal was to.

chip away at the Panthers’ lead.
They wanted to get the deficit to
less than 20 points. “

At one point the score was 11-8’

after a three-pointer by the Red
Flash’s Pete Fox, but St. Francis
allowed the Panthers to go on two
runs of at least six points without a
point from the Red Flash, which put

the Panthers up by 20 at the half.’

This would be the most they could
cut the lead to as the Panthers were
up by as much as 29 points at one

point in the game.

“They are much bigger inside
[than last year],” Jones said. “They
got the rebounds, especially on the

Howland’s reacted to Jones”

-statement that Pitt is a better team’

this year by saying, “I hope he is
right. Ithink we are — when vyou
have guys in the program for three
years, that shows our stability.” ‘_

Pitt is now 17-0 dating back to ’

last year in games where the

‘Panthers hold their opponents to

less than 60 points. They are 6-0
this year when they‘ do this.

“We are getting better defen-
sively,” Knight said. “We need to
work offensively, but we’re
improving every game.”

The Panthers now prepare to
h_ost Penn State at 4 p.m. Saturday.
Page and Knight both stated that
they need to avenge last season’s
loss to the Nittany Lions.

“We take every’ game one by

Penn State.”
“I,wish we were 8-0 going into

this game, but we’re 7,-1,” Howland

said. “We need to focus on the game

BRANDON WALOFF/ASSISTANT PHOTO EDITOR

Pitt players show their disappointment at losing a game in which they held early
leads before giving way to a second half breakdown against the Hokies.

Panthers hurt by poor

Women, page 15

Sophomore center Ieva Kublina, who
used her 6-foot-4-inch frame to dom-
inate the boards all night, recorded a
double-double with 16 points and 10
rebounds.

“She is a giant,” Waites said. “She
is so bigland she’s a great basketball
player.” « '_ A

Wittenmyer was not convinced
that it was so much Kublina’s size
that was a problem for the Panthers,
but the fact that she has a soft touch
and keeps the ball high.

“She was not a very physical
player in the post and I’m used to
being physical,” Wittenmyer said.
“She just likes to turn around and
shoot.”

Virginia Tech also received 18
points from guard Chrystal Starling,
who has struggled the last few games
but had no problem finding the basket
against the Panthers.

Pitt was led by Wittenmyer, who
despite battling an ankle injury had a
team—high 21 points and nine
rebounds. , ,

“Today I was very comfortable, I
saw the basket and just tried to -help
my team out as much as,I could,”
Wittenmyer said.

Junior guard Laine Selwyn was
the only; other Panther to ﬁnish in
double digits, putting up 12 "points
despite going just four of 12 from the
field. She also led the team with

shooting, suffer loss  

seven assists in 35 minutes of play
and was aggressive the entire game
even when Pitt trailed by a large mar-
gm.

“It’s nature, it’s instinct,” Selwyn
said. “I am always going to go out and
play hard whether we’re down five or
up 20.”

A number of Panthers had trouble
finding the net,ginc1uding, Brooke
Stewart who hit just two of 10 shots.
Stewart, who led the Panthers with 23
points in the team’s victory over
Arizona, has had trouble scoring at
home. So far this season she has aver-
aged 9.3 points at the Field House but
18 on the road.

Pitt also did not receive its normal
contribution of 31.6 points off the
bench. Instead, six players combined
for just 17 points, led by freshman
Haley Harguth, who hit her first two
three—point attempts but then missed
the next four.

The loss drops the Panthers to 3-4
and 0-1 in the conference as Pitt is
now. 7-13 in Big East openers. The
Hokies, who were coming off two
losses by a combined three points,
improve to 4-2iand 1-0 in the Big
East.

The Panthers will have a few days
off to prepare to host city rival
Duquesne Saturday night. But as for
the loss to Virginia Tech, there are
simply no excuses.

“We just didn’t have enough

’points and rebounds,” Waites said.

Brigham Young will suffer first loss of year

Compulsive, page 16

3-3 on the road.

Texas Christian doesn’t have a big
runner either, as its top runner, Rick
Madison, has just 541 rushing yards
and not one skilled player has scored
more than four touchdowns for the
team.

Southern Miss senior running back

' Dewayne Woods has nine scores on the

season and wideout Leroy Handy has
broken free for .725 yards on 52 catches.
Southern Miss has won its games by an
average of 9.4 points per game, and I’m
going to have to go with them on this
one.

Brigham Young (-3) at Hawaii

No. 12—ranked Brigham Young (12-
0) stumbles into Hawaii (8-3) missing a
big piece of its undefeated puzzle.

That missing piece is running back
Luke Staley, who is out with a broken

' leg and Brigham Young’s offense might

be broken without him. Staley scored
24 touchdowns this season, rushed for
144 yards per game and his replacement
has only carried the ball 18 times this
season. ~

legal action against the people at the
Bowl Championship Series for antitrust
violations as his undefeated team was
left out of the championship picture and
has been forced to settle playing
Louisville in the Liberty Bowl.

With the school’s exclusion from -

the bowl series, it will likely lose close
to $10 million. The last time Brigham
Young was undefeated was in 1984, a
year that saw it win the national cham-
pionship. Times have changed.

All the weight from the loss of
Staley falls onto quarterback Brandon
Damon, who has thrown for 31 touch-
downs in an offense notorious for
putting up a lot of points. Brigham

Young has averaged 47 points per game
this season. That’s not a typo.

Hawaii is by no means a dog of a 1

team and neither is its offense. Hawaii
is putting up 37 points per game behind
quarterback Nick Rolovich. '

Rolovich has passed for more than ‘

1,000 yards and 12 touchdowns in his

last two performances against Miami

(Ohio) and Air Force. 0 .
Wide receiver Ashley Lelie was his
main target over the two—game span,

pulling in almost 500 receiving yards. ‘

He has 17 touchdowns on the season.
With all of the commotion that has
been stirred up and with all of the media
attention that the team’s athletic direc-
tor is bringing upon it, Brigham Young
has got to be distracted. And lets face it,
being undefeated and playing in the
Liberty Bowl has to be a let down.

its top player and the distraction of
