Councils Act‘

To Curb Pitt,
Tech Disorder

Raids on Carnegie Campus
  Scored; .Oﬁ‘enders
 Involve Schools

Following swiftly in the wake of
reported depredations of property
on the Carnegie Tech campus over
the last week-end, apparently the
work of Pitt students in attempting
to revive a mutually dismissed tra-
dition of bitterness between.the
rival schools, posters reminding
all undergraduates of the responsi-
bility of the respective student

councils made their appearance on
University bulletin boards early
_ Tuesday morning.

Sometime between last Saturday
and Monday several unknown per-
sons invaded the Carnegie Tech
campus and with brushes that drip-
ped gold paint, blocked out the sin-
gle word “Pitt” upon the steps of

- the Tech administration building,
and repeated the offense upon an
adjacent section of the drive and
a nearby traﬁic blinker light.

The incident came as the ﬁrst

outbreak to culminate in property .

damage in two seasons of peace-
ful relations between the rival in-
stitutions. An agreement existing
between the student “councils of
both schools ‘provides that each of
the schools shall accept responsi-

" bility for any damage inflicted by
its students upon the property of
the other.

First notice of the occurrence
was given Pitt authorities Monday
morning when Robert C. Clothier,
dean of men‘, and Lowman Latta,
Dent. ’32, president of student

'council, were requested! by Dean
Tarbell of Carnegie Tech, to visit
the Tech campus and witness the
work of the marauders.

Dean Clothier, expressing his in-
di ation and regret that Pitt stu-
dents should have been guilty of

s such offense, said:

_ “It is extremely regrettable that
any undergraduate in an institution
ye as large as ours should’ be guilty of
such conduct. Certainly it indi-
cates a positive immaturity, anab-
sence of any regard for the pledged
responsibility of fellow students.

. ‘One would ordinarily expect such
conduct to be characteristic onlyof
a small percentage of‘ high school
youth. Everything, however, is be-
ing done to determine the identity
of the guilty party.” '

When the Pitt graduate debating
team meets the combined team of
the Universities of Nottingham and

November 7, in Schenley High

has participated in since 1924.

The subject of the debate is to
be “Resolved: That the dole system
provides a better method-. of relief

sored by the Pittsburgh Branch of
the American Association of Uni-
versity ‘Women, is scheduled to

Coach of Debating

Richard Murphy, coach of debat-
ing, and Albert E. Leven, a senior
in Pitt Law school, will represent
Pitt. Both Murphy and «Levon are
experienced debaters, having de-
bated as undergraduates at Pitt.
They will argue the negative side
of the question.

The English team is made up of
Stuart Craig, of the University of
Nottingham and John Needham, of
Durham University. These men
represent the National Union of
Students of England which annual-
ly selects 'a team to represent Eng-
lish universities in debates with
foreign schools. The speakers are
selected on a basis -of competi-
tion among universities throughout
England; Craig, and Needham.
therefore, are considered among

the foremost debaters in England.

Craig from Nottingham
‘ Stuart Craig was a distinguished
student and took his B. A. degree
with honors in philosophy. During
his undergraduate days at Notting-

ham, Craig took a leading part in.

the activities of the Students
Union, holding, at different times,
the ofﬁces of treasurer and presi-
dent. He was also prominent in
intercollegiate debating and other
student activities, including the
Student Christian Movement of
which he was ﬁrst secretary and
then president. ‘Craig was awarded
his hockey colors, and also rep-
resented Nottingham in golf and in

Disarmament

War With Germany, Rus-
sia Imminent-——William,s

 

 

Dr. Benjamin Williams, professor
of political science, predicted a
world war, with Germany and Rus-
sia on the offensive within a few
years, unless drastic changes are
made in world disarmament, at a
meeting of the Inquiry Club held
Wednesday.

Dr. Williams stated that arma-
ments are no longer regarded as
sources of national wealth. He
stated that the ﬁnancial situation
of the United States today would
be much brighter if it didn't spend
seventy per cent of its national in-
come on payments for wars.

The under-dog position of Ger-
many under the requirements of
the Versailles treaty, was given by
Dr. Williams as the reason for
Germany's siding with Russia in
the case of future conﬂict. France,
Great Britain and other Allied
powers are too heavily armed," Dr.
Williams said, “to insure the safe-
ty of Germany”

Major 0. H. Sch V dot, of the po-
litical science depgtment will re-
fute Dr. Williams’ statements next
Wednesday.

honors in history, and held many
student ofﬁces in "addition to the
treasurership and presidency of
the Union Society at ‘Durham. Al-
though his main -sport is rowing, he
was captain of boats in his school
and was awarded his Half-Palatin-
ate this year. 'He also played
Rugby, association football, cricket
and hockey. Needham debated dur-
ing his undergraduate days for the
Union Society, and also found time
to pursue literary and historical
hobbies. He will return to the uni-
versity next year for postgraduate
work. 3

The English speakers are expec-

, ted to present some new angles on

the subject of unemployment gath-
ered from actual experience and
from ﬁrst hand research into the
‘workings of the dole. A great deal
has been written on unemployment
and allied subjects in American
newspapers and periodicals, and
authorities are uncertain which
means of combating unemployment
and its accompanying evils is best.
Debatet Charity- Dole

At present the method employed
in this country is charity, while in
England the dole system is used.
Each team will be upholding the
method employed by its native
country; thusithe debate in a- sense
will be England vs. United States
as well as Pitt vs. Nottingham-
Durham. Last winter the Pitt
undergraduate debaters used unem-
ployment insurance as the subject
of over ﬁfty intercollegiate and ex-
tension debates.

The English debaters’ itinerary
calls for debates with twenty-four
American. universities, including
scrools with reputations for debat-
ing teams such as: Vassar, Wells,
Johns Hopkins, George Washing-
ton, /Pennsylvania, Boston, Dart-
mouth, Brown,_Bates, and Pitt. The
trip started: October 20, at Vassar,
and ends December 11, at Bates
College, Lewiston, Maine.

Tickets, at 50 cents each for the
debate are on sale now and can be
purchased from Samuel iStrauss,-de-
bate manager; W. ‘M. Parrish, pro-
fessor of English, or Mrs. Murphy.

“Inasmuch as the slight decrea-5_9
in enrollment was, for the most
part, conﬁned to the women and t0
the junior colleges, there are ap*-
proximately the same number of

Since this year's enrollment will
not vary greatly from last year's.
the number of men registered in
campus undergraduate schools
should lie between 2,500 and 2.750-
Of this number the only -students
ineligible for rushing are those who
were depledged because of failure
to attain the necessary twelve qual-
ity points and twelve credits. These
men will not again be eligible for

Frosh Customs Flop

Last Friday, a spectacle which must have seemed both

- silly and a bit disgusting to any student, who boasts of aver-

age college intelligence, was enacted on campus. The per-
formance was as pathetic as it was ridiculous.

Failing to engender within freshmen that intangible
sense of class loyalty which was to have made‘ them willing
converts to regulations, the Custom Committee reverted to a
cruder,.if slightly more practical meansof persuasion. Pad-
dles reappeared on campus after an absence of four years
and precipitated such a disorderly, unplanned outburst that
in no way could it succeed in realizing a deﬁnite purpose.

. THOUT LEADERSHIP and unactuated by any motive

other than that of creating noise and a general disturb-
ance, the attempt was made to intimidate frosh into wear-
ing ties and dinks by this sporadic and unprecedented dis-
play of force. But the whole thing turned out to be only a
sorry spectacle. Perhaps a dozen freshmen were compelled
to “assume the angle” while a staccato of paddle strokes
was applied to them. But the rest of the fresh went on
their way unmolested and the best testimony to the disor-
ganized state of aﬂairsis found in the fact that several
dinkless freshmen were reported to have assisted in the
punishment of their more loyal and conscientious brothers,
who were complying with rules by wearing both tie and

Made from clay taken from the excavations for the Cathe-

classical Grecian type, at pres-
room, is the gift of Mr. Charles
ley Association, and the present
y House, to the University.

The vase is Mr. Cooper’s expression of the relationship be-

, mtwieenv-Kingsley Association and the University, a relationship
1 which he believes to be of especial:

    
         
 
      
      
 
 
      
     
 
      
       
 
  
     
 
        
     
 
      
     

closeness by reason of the impetus
,given by Charles Kingsley and

.. . I other English men of letters to the

E movement for extension of univer-
sity culture to the workmen. The
,jva.ee was made by the department

of Pottery at Kingsley House, the
institution which was the realiza-
_'; tion of Mr. Cooper’s dream to make
mpossible a guild of artist workmen
in this city.’

The lines of the vase follow those
of the great period of Athenian
Tcultnre, and express a spirit of
, Greekdecoration which adorned
pits’ obleets of art with portrayals
' of the familiar activities of daily
-life. This vase depicts the life at a
-‘ modern university, which, in its
f ‘balanced development of the body
‘fund in its. representation of all
-phases of the mind, resembles
strikingly the Greek ideal.

The ﬁrst of the Cathedral of‘

Learning’s many soaring Gothic

arches has been completed. On the
Forbes street side of the building,
a. vaulted groined ceiling over the
entry way to the smaller entrance
on that side has beenﬂnished, and
work on the large Forbes street-
entrance is under way. Eventuallyi

two vaulted entrances will be built!

on the Fifth avenue side of thei
structure, one on the Bigelow side,‘
and one on the Belleﬁeld avenue

side will be constructed. ‘ _

At present, the masons are

working on a stone setting pro-

gram which should see the Forbes

street side of the Cathedral com-

pleted by Thanksgiving. Stone for

the other sides, with the excep-

tion of the main entrances at the

front and rear of the building, is

stored on the first ﬁve ﬂoors of

the Cathedral Besides the setting

of stone, workmen are busy plac-

ing glass in tracery windows on

the thirteenth and thirty-ﬁfth

the roofs.

ASCEND TO TOP
Last week, the Cathedral was

‘visited by 45 delegates from the

Pan-American Commercial Con-
gress. Two of the Cathedral's swift
elevators whisked the party and
their guides to the top of Pitt's
skyscraper in» exactly 47 seconds
and they were much interested in
viewing the city.

The delegates were from the
Pan-American Congress in Wash-
ington, and had just arrived from
State College. They are. engaged
in a two weeks tour through the
Central-Eastern States, visiting im-
portant centers of industry. In
Pittsburgh. Westinghouse Electric
plants, Edgar Thompson Steel
works, and the Heinz plant was of
especial interest.

Most of the Latin-Americans and
South American delegates had
never heard of the Cathedral or
Learning of the University ‘of
Pittsburgh before, but they ex-

/pressed great interest in the pro-

ject, especially when told of the
plans for the several nationalities’
rooms. All of them agreed that the
Cathedral was one of the most
beautiful buildings, even in its un-
ﬁnished state, that they had ever
beheld.

Serious Even’In Most Serious, Pressing Moments

By JOHN D. PAULUS
“What relation did you say you
are to Queen of Czechoslovakia?

,Oh, pardon me, Bernard Shaw, I

didn’t see through your whiskers.
Or is it this Pittsburgh smoke?
Make minewheatcakes.”

If you ran into a line of chatter
like that what would you think?
Or would you think? Well, it's only
Clark and McCullough, stage com-
edians. And seeing those two is
like running the gauntlet with
Pocahontas standing at one ‘end
yelling for a touchdown. It's really
that silly!

Clark peeked under the door,
wound his watch, smiled into the
mirror, talked to the cat and ﬁnal-
ly decided that everything was all

‘set.’ With two puffs on his cigar

and two pokes at McCullough he
ﬁnished his setting-up exercises.
.“I don’-t choose to run for presi-
dent because Alfonso isn’t king
any more. What do I think of pro-
hibition? Huh, bigger and better
-agents! And did you know Aimee
McPherson is my sister’s niece-’s
daughter-in-law? You didn’t? Tech
Tech." ‘

By this time McCullough was
hanging from the chandelier. Clark
held out a mouse trap, then a ten-
nis racket, and ﬁnally a ﬁve-cent
cigar. When McCullough came
down it was-time to begin.‘

tee on Student Relations.

He is being assisted by the Fresh-

“Yet. my poor old mother. She
sewed buttons on Eskimos’ over-
coats.”

“And, et tu Brute! If the Hoover
dam was chopped up into little
dams how many little dams would
there be? And if you answer that
one, l’ll think of something easy."

“Look out, don’t touch that
greasepaint. It bites! What did
you say you did in California?
Sell water to stricken Russiarﬁ?
Ha, ha, puzzle No. 1, Who struck
the stricken Russians?”

By this time everything was up-
set. Clark’s collar was on McCul-
lough’s garter. Clark brought a.
horse in, saddled it, hitched it to
a wagon, then pretended the horse
was dead. Since no veterinarians
were around, the horse was buried.

“What do I think of college-? Col-
lege, did you say? H’mmmm let's

mal affair heard an abundance of
sage advice and observations ex-
pressed by Dr. Bowman, Robert

C. Clothier, dean of men, and two
student representatives, Edith
Raschen and Robert Machesney.
The affair, which has been held
for the past eight years at Plit. Was
this year a formal occasion for the
first time since its origin, here.
Prolonged applause followed the
talk of Chancellor Bowman, who

During the past week, practically every sports writer in the city
and those who get paid for being such have given the “whys” and

among these writers seems to be that the Irish won by reason of su-
parlor numbers and the inability of the Pitt backs to stop their oppo-

We personally would like to take an exception to their remarks
that the «Notre Dame ﬁrst and second teams were on a par and that the
 score was an indication of the -diﬂerences between the second

Notre Dame did not start its real first team. Some of the
' starters were the best men for their positions on the Notre
-Dame squad, but Murphy, Mahoney, and one or two others are
second stringers, a fact which was proven by the manner in
which their substitutes conducted themselves once they had
entered the ball‘ game.
Anderson's trick in starting the second team men men-
tioned above was to hold the Pitt offensive down and to wear
K the Panther first stringers down. The clifferencebetween the
Notre Dame first and second team players lies in their offensive
and not in their defensive ability. Pitt’s defense was not trou-
bled much until Anderson began his series of substitutions, in
other words, to send in his best offensive bets aside from
Marchmount Schwartz. ' V -
~, If you care to look at it from another angle, Notre Dame’s ﬁrst
Loam would probably have piled up a one touchdown victory over the
Pitt first team if both were called upon to use their best players. And
Xfhpén, if at any time Anderson decided to use his second team men
and Sutherland countered by using his own, the advantage would prob-
ably swing to Pitt. ’ .
All the above reasoning may seem muddled, but our conclusions de-
rived from the Pitt-Notre Dame game can be summed up brieﬂy, as

follows: ,

1. Notre Dame's first team is miles better than its second team.

.2. The Pitt second team is every bit as good as Notre Dame's
second team.

3. Notre Dame's starting lineup was a combination_ of the
first team and the best defensive players on the second
string brigade.

4. If Jock Sutherland had used the same system, the score at
least would have been closer.

5. Sutherland did not employ his second team men as often
as was necessary. Players who were groggy at times and
out on their feet were permitted to stay in the game despite
the fact that there were capable substitutes waiting to take
their place and who although not as talented could have
made a better showing in their better condition.

=8. Notre Dame fought harder and had a better knowledge of

the rules. They played just inside the rules. , .
1 It's useless, however, to sit back and look at what might have been
The defeat at the hands of Notre Dame eliminated Pitt from any pos-
sible consideration as a national champion, but its chances for the East-
ern championship are still bright.

At present, New York U., Columbia, Syracuse, Brown, Cornell,

East which boast of enrollments reaching into the thousands. If all
of these teams suffer a tie or a defeat before the close of the season
and -the Panthers win their ‘remaining games, Pitt will have as good an
opportunity as any to be ranked as the number one team of the East
for 1931. ~
‘ N , Several of these teams should be eliminated before the
close of the season. Columbia meets Brown on November 14

to tell the boys just what is ex-
pected of a Pitt basketball player,

During the past three weeks the

vilion this year, an the adherents
of the hardwood pastime all over
the country will ﬁnd a well-bal-
anced outﬁt wearing the Gold and
Blue this winter. Bus Albright
again seems to be a ﬁxture at the
center berth, while “the demon
mites,” Doc Kowallis and Timmy
Lawry, co-captains, are certainties
at the forward positions. Don
Smith will again be a bulwark at
the one guard position; while two
likely looking sophomores, both tall
and rangy, Ochsenhirt and Mc-

and faces Syracuse on Thanksgiving Day, while Cornell faces
Pennsylvania in Philadelphia also on Thanksgiving Day.

in addition, three of these teams meet opponents which
are liable .,to upset them before the season is over, although
these teams are not from the East or have already been de-
feated. New York U. must defeat the undefeated Georgia team
at New York on November 7, and considering the record of the
Southerners of the past few years, this task will not be a light
one.

Syracuse faces dangerous situations in its games with Mich-
igan State at East Lansing tomorrow and with Colgate at Syra-
cuse two weeks hence. Colgate’s lone defeat this year was ad-
ministered by New York U. last week, 13-0. Penn will probably
take it on the chin next week when it meets Notre Dame.
Harvard with victories over Bates, New Hampshire, Army and

Texas, has the best chance of any team in this group to ﬁnish its sea-
son without a blemish. Its remaining games are with Virginia, Dart-
mouth, Holy Cross and Yale, and none of these teams has shown enough
todate to‘ -cause Barry Wood andhis mates sleepless nights. Of course,
the Harvard schedule as a whole is not a hard one, probably the easiest
one of any of the so-called major teams in the East; but if the team is

' undefeated, Crimson supporters can point to the ﬁgures, and in the last

analysis, figures never lie.

Pitt fans will watch the games in,which these teams participate
with keen interest. The Panthers have a great outﬁt this season, and it
would be a shame if they were robbed of their chances for the Eastern
championship because of a defeat at the hands pf a team which un-
doubtedly belongs among the greatest of all times.

given plenty opportunity tc display

The athletic rivalry between Penn
State and Pitt started back in 1893
when Pitt was called Western Uni-
versity of Pennsylvania, and it has
continued down to the present date
with hardly any let-up of the tradi-
tional competition. In fact, Penn
State was one of Pitt’s ﬁrst three

rivals, only Geneva and Wash-Jeff
coming before it.

Football is the chief cause of
rivalry. -Out of thirty-three total
games played with State. Pitt has
won nineteen and lost twelve, two
games being scoreless ties. In more
recent years, from 1922 to 1930,
-State has fared badly at the hands
of the Panthers on the gridiron.
Pitt has won the last nine games.

Pitt won the tilts from 1913 to
1918. From 1893 to 1912 Pitt only
won four games out of ﬁfteen, the
Victories coming in 1910, when
Hube Wag-ner, Pitt all-time right
end played, and in 1904, 1905, and
1907.

Tomorrow's game will be the
ﬁrst in many years that the annual
meet of the two rival Pennsylvania
teams has not been on Thanks-
giving Day.

Penn State, however. has not
gone completely unavenged for
their football defeats of the late
years. The Lion has a national

Panther Team Meets
W. Va. U. Tonight

 

Unlashing one of the ;most pow-
erful offensive attacks ever seen in
a freshman game at Penn State,
the little Panthers kept their un-
beaten and unscored on record in-
tact. Although the ﬁrst team was
in for only a short time in the ﬁrst
period, the seconds showed plenty
of ﬁght and class in rolling up a
score of 33-0. "

Munjas was acting captain for
the day and he played a wonderful
all around game, passing, kicking,
and rushing. Soon after the start
of the game, Weisenbaugh took the
ball on an end run and didn’t stop
until he had crossed the line. The
third touchdown was the result of
a blocked kick and the score re-
mained 19-0 at the half,

Balasia Injured.

In the second quarter, while mak-
ing a wide sweep around the end,
Balasia brought the ball within a
foot of the goal line but was tackled

very hard and couldn’t regain his-

feet. It was found, upon examina-
tion, that two of his ribs had been
broken and .he was immediately
taken to the hospital. During the
rest of the game, Pitt received very
little opposition from the “State
men and succeeded in rolling up 14
more points. Stark, Smith, and
Wilkins played very good ball dur.
ing the last two periods.

The next game for the frosh is
with the West Virginia team at
Fairmont, tonight. The Mountain.
eers have lost but one game this
year, having been beaten by Car-

negie Tech Saturday, 6-0.

Panther Gridmen Hold
Big Edge In Series
With Opponents

 

An angry Panther eleven, still
licking its wounds from the Notre
Dame defeat, will meet a ﬁghting
Penn State team tomorrow atqthe
State ﬁeld. This is the ﬁrst time
in twenty-nine years that a Pitt
and State football teams are pl ‘-
ing on the Lions’ gridiron and he
State players are determined to
give the Panthers a tough game.

It was a way back in 1902’that
Pitt, then the Western University
of Pennsylvania, or, as it was
called, WUP, invaded State for the
last time until this year. State won
then, 27 to 0, but prospects for a‘
repetition of that victory tomorrow
are. dark. indeed. State ,- has not
copped a victory over Pitt since
1919 when the Lions carved out a
20 to 0 victory over the Panthers.
Both the 1920 and the 1921 games
were scoreless ties, and since that
time Pitt has taken every game.

Change Lineup

The Pitt team will probably have
two changes in the lineup ‘that
started against Notre Dame last
Saturday. “Tar” Onder will take
the place of Hart Morris, who -is
out for several weeks with a

broken hand, and Mike Sebastian’

will probably play right halfback
instead of “Bulldog” Reider, who
was badly bunged up last Saturday.

Although several of the State
players are not in the best.condi-
tion all the regulars who played
against Syracuse should start. Cap-
tain Lasich, who has been the
Lions’ outstanding star‘, has taken
part in little scrimmage this week
because of an injury. Curry, right
guard who was unable to play last
Saturday,ibecause of a neck injury,
is still in bad shape and he will
see little action tomorrow. Tom
Slusser, former Schenley High
School star, was promoted to the
end position on the varsity last
week but immediately hurt his
ankle and is not expected to take
a very active part in tomorrow's
game.

Season Unsuccessful

Penn State has had a very un-
successful season thus far, having
won but one game out of five
Dlayed Waynesburg sent State off
to’ a bad start when, in the first
game of the season, it unexpectedly

week, to Syracuse.

record, Bob Higgins, head coach,

After “Rush Season;
Sell Old Books

“After the first two weeks
of school, the rush. for text-
books and supplies subsides
somewhat and we have less
trouble here giving the prompt
and satisfactory service we al-
ways strive to maintain,” re-
ports William F. Lenz, man-
ager of the University Book-
store. There is no decrease in
his business. He and eight as--
sistants have been kept very
busy as usual during. the se-
mester.

In the strict sense, the book-
store maintains no set hours
but attempts to meet the de-
mands of the students. During
most of the semester it is
open from 8:30 to 5 o’clock on
week days and from 8:30 to 1
on Saturdays.

Mr. Lenz has noticed no de-
crease in the general demand
for books during this period.
There has been a slight in-
crease, however, in the de-
mand for second-hand books.
The University maintains a
market for students who de-
sire to sell their used books.
The student sets the price
himself and the bookstore acts
as his agent in disposing of
it. Students realize more on

 Players Open’ Year .
  lWith Novel Mixer Party

 

 At the most unusual social event
in their organization’s history that

was as successful as the group's
legitimate “on stage” productions,
ninety supporters of Pitt Players,
campus dramatic club. celebrated
the opening of another year of

' board-treading activitity Tuesday

night, with a “mixer” party in Ac-
uvitiest" Building.

’ Director Carl Cass, with his read-
ing of "Casey at the Bat,” follow-
ed,.in successive encores, by his
“Discourse to Husbands,” and an
come-
dians Moran and Mack, took ﬁrst
honors in the applause that fol-
lowed every number on the Dro-

_ gram.

No less -commendable was John
_'St'.,Peter’s playing of his own blues
composition, “Baby -Can’t You

_iF'ind Me‘ a Moon?” accompanying

Betty<ﬁ_Quarrie, Col. '34, who sang
the verse. St. Peter's second offer-

” . lngwas George Gershwin’s. “Rhap-
, sody in Blue.”

Martin B. Fallon, Col. '31, came
through in ﬁne style with a series
of imitations, «ranging from the
deep radio voice that twice a week
bellows “Don’t rasp your throat
*. . . .” to a perfect impersonation of

In the course of the evening a

in the darkenedvroom, the murder-

Death, it was established, came
by strangulation at the hands of

“Cut Loose”

Lightweights F e a t u r e
With Knockouts

Knockouts featured this week's
boxing practices at the track house,
with the 115 pounders showing up
best.

The boxers were allowed to “cut
loose” for the ﬁrst time since prao
tice began, and the manner in
which the order was taken was a
distinct surprise to Coach Orsini.
“I expected some action,” said
Orsini, “but not as much as the
boys showed. It was an agreeable
surprise, and I am sure that their
work will continue to show that
they are interested in boxing.” ‘

Show Speed.

Besides the punch shown by the
boxers in the lighter classes, all
the other boxers are beginning to
limber up and show speed. More
candidates have reported to Coach
Orsini since the ﬁrst practice, the
majority of them being light-
weights.

The’ collegiate competition starts
January 30, when the Panthers will
play host to West Virginia. This
leaves approximately three months
to bring the boxers along, and
Coach Orsini does not intend to
rush the training along and have
the boxers become “stale” before
the season opens.

day andhe is liable to break away

Employment Office
Calls for Men to be on
Blood- Givers’ List

The Student Employment of-
ﬁce is out for blood!’

In a. recent interview with E.
Willis Whited, acting director
of the employment service, the
Weekly learned that, in the
event of an emergency request
for blood transfusion volun-
teers, the employment office
would be caught short.

In previous years, a. separate
list of men available for blood
transfusion services has been
kept on ﬁle. When calls came
in from Pittsburgh hospitals
for men who were willing to
give small amounts of blood to
patients at a stipulated price,

‘ that list was brought out, and
a number of healthy young
males went forth with bared
arms.

Somehow, during the sum-
mer, the list was lost. Now
new men are being recruited’,
who, upon demand, and pro-
viding their blood is suitable,
will be willing to serve in any
one of the many transfusions
that take place daily in the
city’s hospitals.

Although prices sometimes
vary, the ﬂgure quoted rarely
falls below $25 per pint. _

Up to yesterday morning the
following men had offered
themselves for the blood sacri-
ﬁce: Clifford Benson, H. B.
Crumbaker, Fritz Guenter,
Ogle ‘Homer, -Charles Beck and
S. J. Wilden.

If you have ever harbored any
poetical tendencies and then tried
to translate your sentimental emo-
tions into words, you probably real-
ize just how difficult such a project
is. We have always had an utmost
respect, almost a reverence, for

. great poets. ever since we tried to

express our overwhelming prefer-
ence for the girl next door through
the medium of poetry. Imagine
then, the talent of Allen E. Wood-
all, instructor in E.nglish, who has
alreadywritten two plays, besides
a great deal of poetry!

Mr. Woodall’s works have appear-
‘ed in the.“Midland,” the “Sewanee
Review,” and the “Minnesota His-
tory.” , Mr. Woodall, a graduate of
Syracuse and Columbia Universi-
ties, wrote an epic, “iLucifer’s
Dream” and other poems for the
“Minnesota History,” back in 1928.
Its success prompted the series of
poems known as “December Frag-
ments” which appeared -one year
later.

In 1930. Mr. Woodall undertook a
dramatization of the Virgil classic,
“The Aeneid.” The play was writ-

For Students To Study Abroad
Given, According to Mrs. Mitchell

 

 

     
   
 

       
 

\

“Pitt students have opportunities for international experi.
ence far beyond those which we shall try to give them in ‘the
international rooms of the Cathedral of Learning,” according
to Mrs. Ruth Crawford Mitchell, secretary of the University for
the Pittsburgh Committee on Foreign Study. In her oﬂice on
the eighth ﬂoor of the Cathedral, which in furniture and ar-

rangement shows a real appreciation for the ﬁne qualities of
foreign art, Mrs. ‘Mitchell discussed:

the many foreign fellowships to
which serious students may aspire.

Augusta. Harkanyi, who brought
greetings from Budapest to the Y.
W. C. A. International Tea last
month, has been literally exchanged“
by her university for Joseph
Svirbely who «received his Ph. D.
in chemistry at Pitt last June and
is now doing chemical research at
Budapest. «Mr. Svirbely’s work is
made possible‘ by the University of
Pittsburgh Exchange Fellowship
which each year sends a faculty
member or graduate assistant from
Pitt abroad for one year while a
representative of a European uni-
versity comes here.

Foreign study has been the spur

. to several international romances

at Pitt. Vera. Proudky and Gerald
Mrazek came from Czechoslova-
kia for independent study, met at
Pitt, and were married before re-
turning to their native country.
John Marsalka, Col. '30, left to
study Slavonic history in Prague
in company with his wife, Mlada
Friedlow. also an exchange stu-
dent from Czechoslovakia. Shortly
after his arrival at Prague, Marsal-
ka was elected chairman ‘of the

Amen'iicanHsCzechoslovlakian Stu-
dents’ Organization. His work at
Prague was so outstanding that his
fellowship was renewed in 1931-32.

Dr. A. L. Robinson of the chemis-
try depa-rtmen; represented Pitt in
Germany in 1929, while ‘Hans Dn-
mont studied here. In 1930 Wal-
ter F. Feidknecht came here from
Switzerland, but Pitt «sent no rep-
resentative. Paul Ursin, Col. '29‘;

and Ernest Skapik, Col. '31, also 

are studying
Prague. .

“However," says M-rs. Mitchell,
the opportunities for Pitt students
are not limited by the single ex-
change fellowship awarded yearly.

Slavonic history ‘in

Carl Voss, Col. '31 successfully ap- » I

plied for a fellowship at Elsinore
which enabled him to study abroad

all summer, and hundreds of both -

graduate and undergraduate foreign
fellowships are open to all univer-
sity students.” A list of these
fellowships is published yearly by-
the Institute of International Edu-
cation and may be procured from
Mrs. ‘Mitchell or Dean Sieg. Grad-
uate students and faculty members
interested mu-st apply within the
next two months.

It seems strange. th91‘e1°1'e»

to learn that the Y. W. C. A-.

Committee have been com-

Alumni Hall is left each day-
Eyes long accustomed to the

blind to the repulsiveness of

the whole thing. It takes a
person not accustomed to the

' plorable state of untidiness in,
which we leave the principal
University recitation building.
Visitors recently voiced their
shock at the condition, and this
complaint has precipitated the
action of the student organiza-
tions in conducting the pro-
posed campus glean-up.

Students have not alone been
to blame for the condition in
Alumni ‘Hall. The administra-
tion has failed to provide ade-
quate receptacles in which
waste might be placed, Last
week a. total of three baskets
was counted in a building in
which more than 1,500 students
have classes.

The campaign for campus
cleanliness gets under way
next week. In the meantime,
why not practice now? If you

don't throw it down. Hunta

Letters

 

,j'1‘o the Editor of the Pitt
‘ Weekly:

There is too much fancy
dressing by men students on
the Pitt campus. A few of the
better dressers have set the
pace and now most of the stu-
dents dress for school as if

‘ they were dressing for a dance
or business engagement. At
many of the Eastern schools,
such as Dartmouth, the men
dress in sport clothes or other
rough outﬁts. Typical of their
costume is a pair of corduroy
trousers, a lumber jacket and
a. pair of heavy work shoes or
high tops. At Pitt, one must
“wear a cravat to match the
color mode of his shirt and
suit.

The well dressed student
must necessarily be spending
more for his clothes and their
upkeep. If the students would
wear rougher clothing, of a
more collegiate nature, the ex-
pense item of clothes would

. be considerably smaller.

The wearing of rougher
clothing would add a.,pictur-
esque quality to the campus
-and make it less formal, more
collegiate, and less like a busi-
ness institution. Perhaps the
informality of dress would pro-
vide that spirlt and comerad-
erie which it has been com-
plained is lacking.

The fact that Pitt is co-edu-
cstional should not make any
material difference because
the girls would soon grow used
to the style of dress. Anyhow,
we are here for an education,

enjoyment, and college life

and we shouldn't consider the
girls’ opinions as making any
difference.

One cannot expect an over-
night revolution in campus
dress, but if some of the lead-
ers in school activities would
start the movement it is likely

Is This “Spirit” ?

HE ANNUAL SERIES of
disorders Which usually
"make their appearance during
the week preceding the Pitt-
Carnegie Tech football game
seemed to have gotten an earl-
ier start this Year. $18118,
spelling out “Pitt” were painted
on several of the buildings -on
the Tech campus. .

While administrative officials

of the two schools are always
glad to recognize a. display of
spirit among their undergradu-
ates, they do not approve of
the boyish and ungentlemanly
manner in which this spirit 1138
been shown in the past with
regards to the annual football
game between Pitt and Car-
negie. .

Extreme measures have been
taken by these oiﬁvc-.ials to curb
such activities, but their ef-
forts have proved in vain.

Students should realize that _
the ‘destruction of property
does not repay them for an)’
imaginary grudge or feeling
which they may have toward
their opponents, but that it
rather places the other mem-
bers of their school in a bad
light and causes outsiders to
look with disdain upon the in-
stitution.

The Student Councils of both
Pitt and Tech have made nu-
merous pleas to the other un-
dergraduates to stop these per-
formances and to limit their
display of loyalty to their team
by cheering it on during the
game.

Destroying. the property‘ of
others will not affect the ﬁnal
results of a. football game.
Football is a great collegiate
sport; but if the student bodies
of contesting schools persist
in extending their enthusiasm
beyond their vocal cords, the
game will degrade and lose its
appeal to millions of fans.

McGill University —- “Resolved.
that it is better to be drum}; than
to be in love,” was the topic of a.
recent formal debate.

 

Editor of the Pitt Weekly:

As representative members
of the Senior and lsophomore
classes we oifer humble apol-
ogies to the Freshmen. We do
this I in all sincerity. They
came to this University expect-
ing to be treated as human be-
ings and gentlemen-—-which
they are. But their expecta-
tions have not been fulﬁlled.
Only last Friday, men whom
the University is most proud
of, profaned the highest stand-
ards of decency and‘ self-respect
and‘ resorted to stone-age
methods in their treatment of
men whose knowledge of this
school is limited by a. few
weeks’ experience.

To our minds the Druids‘ and
Customs Committee are most
reprehensible for having taken
the stand they did. We feel
that a. man does not “owe” his
loyalty to any school or insti-
tution. Rather, it is the school’s
duty to prove its worth and
thereby win his devotion. We
do not feel that loyalty can be
instilled through the medium of
paddles, torn coats, or black
socks. These things are basic-
ally opposed to ordinary com-
mon sense_ and decency.

We seriously question that
the Druid viewpoint is repre-
sentative of our attitude of
the student body. A modest
investigation on our part has
proven to our satisfaction that
student -body and faculty alike
resent Friday’s episode. Can’t
we set a precedent in clearing
away the deadwood of custom
that will be a mark for future
student leaders to shoot at?

When we came to the Y. M. &
W. H. A. auditorium to hear the
ﬁrst of the concert series——Editha
Fleischer, soprano, in a song pro-

Her name is hot at very familiar
one; she is at dramatic soprano;
dramatic sopranos have a way of
singing Italian impossibilities and
endless rhapsodies about American
hills’ and moonlit waters. But
Editha. Fleischer sang one of the
most perfect and tasteful programs
in one of the most admirable voices
that have ever graced a Pittsburgh
series. Miss F‘leischer’s voice is

without exaggeration, full without
dripping lusciousness. Her inter-
pretation is practicaly faultless;
she is one of those rarities——a vir-

gave us Schuman, “Der Nussbaum”
with grace and “Widmung” with
steady ﬁre. She resurrected for us
some half-forgotten Schubert-—
“Geheimes,” “Liebesbotschaft” and
“Der Musensohn.” And she closed
her ﬁrst half with the finest per-
formance of the “Fore-lle” that we

have ever heard.
at :0: II

There was a ﬁne and mellow-
ed group of-old English songs,
introduced by “My Lovely Ce-
lia,” in which Miss Fleischer
showed us a restraint that was
genuine and refreshing. And
the last section boasted a. rare
Debussian gaiety called “Man-
doline.” Even the inevitable
relaxations, the plaintive
French one by Mr. Hahn and
the involved waltz from “Boo-
caccio,” were amazingly inof-
fensive.

“Admirable Critchton,” at the Nix-
on last week. They say the play
dated-—a.nd it did date. They say
there were moments of boredom--—
and there may have been such mo-
ments. But the cast was so well
chosen, the play so substantial, the
acting so careful that we were will-
ing to waive such minor’ issues.
Fay Bainter was equally good
when she slept in a long and lazy
dress on a short and lazy couch,
when she hunted deer in a. South-
Sea-Island version of a Robinh-cod
get-up, when she played the ener-
getic wife-to-be in trails and rhine-
stones. And Mr. Hampden was all
that could be asked of a Critchton,
dominating the play continually and
subtly, without once seeming to
dominate the stage.

Interest and enthusiasm greeted
the announcement last week by the

Percival Hunt, head of the de-
partment~—“There is. a deﬁnite
need for a. literary publication of
some sort on the campus. The
large quantities of good work writ-
ten by students should have some
outlet."

Dr. Harold VV. Schoenberger,
professor—“I surely do favor such
an undertaking. It is a worthy
project, for, if successful, it will
pave the way for future literary
efforts on the part of The Pan-
ther.”

Frederick P. Mayer, assistant
professor——“You might put a. star
by my statement and say ‘This tes-
timony is not paid for.’ I believe

“Steps met’ with enormous ap-
proval on the part of the student
body. Its failing was due to its
editors being‘ unable to devote suffi-
cient time to its publication. The

issue, will be able to concentrate
their efforts into a probable suc-
cess.”

Will be a serious attempt to put
out a literary publication on the’

project ever undertaken by The
