Rea, White to head Greek governance groups

By Eric M. Smith
Staff Writer

Gregory Rea was elected the
new president of the Inter-
Fraternity Council last’ night.

Rea, a founding father of the
recolonized Phi Delta Theta
fraternity, will replace Darin
McMullen as head of the Inter-
Fraternity Council. The term of
office is one year.

Rea defeated two other
candidates, Gregjamma of Phi
Kappa Alpha and David Matta
of Sigma Phi Epsilon.

Rea’s three-minute speech
was supplemented by a
handout that stressed his goal

ship on the campus and im-
proving the image of the IFC.

Questions were raised
concerning his view of the
current alcohol policy, which
restricts the use of kegs at
parties.Rea said the rule was a
“reality that would have to be
dealt with. ”

The position of internal vice
president was filled by Matta.
He was originally nominated
for this position last week, only
recently deciding to run for
president.

Matta made light of his
running for both offices when
he stepped in front of the
fraternity representatives for the
second time. During. his

campaign for the presidency,
Matta stressed his record with
IFC.

“I have a distinct advantage
now; you know who I am, and
you know what I did,” Matta
said.

Matta was challenged by Eric
Scerbo of Pi Kappa Phi and
Daniel Wray of Delta Tau Delta.

The current internal VP, Andy
Feldman, stressed the
importance of the position on
policy decisions. He reminded
IFC members that the vice
president has the same vote as
the president.

McMullen chastised the
members for failing to ask
questions of the candidates.

“It’s shocking and
disheartening that no one
wanted to know anything,”
McMullen said.

Chris Black of Phi Sigma

Kappa was elected external vice

president. _

Black will act as a liaison
between the Greek council and
the university and surrounding
community.

Filling the remaining council
positions, Richard Friedman of
Delta Tau Delta was elected
treasurer, and Joe Boman of
Sigma Chi was elected
secretary.

In other Greek business, Lori
White of Delta Delta Delta was

Space limits
force library
to move books

to Harmarville

By Larry Chough
Staff Writer J

Due to the lack of space on campus,
many of Pitt’s libraries will be relocating
various books to off-campuslocations in
order to make room for the continuous
addition of new books.

According to Pamela S. Vance, assistant
director for administrative and access
services for the university library system,
most of Pitt’s libraries have reached or will
soon reach the limit of available shelf
space. They are forced to transport various
volumes to deter the eventual
overcrowding of their facilities.

“We are not discarding any materials,”

. she said. “We simply have more books

than we can accommodate, and if someone

How Student Healtlo

By Jackie Estkowski
sum‘ Writer

For $46 a semester, students can receive
the best health care available through

Pitt’s Student Health Service, according to "

Franklin Carter, SHS director.

The Student Health Service’s fee, which
accounts for the inﬁrmary’s $1.7 million
budget, covers the costs of X-rays and
labwork conducted by university
physicians in all areas of service, including
clinical, gynecological, dermatological and
educational.

Carter said the fee also provides for
unlimited visits and free psychological
and psychiatric consultations.

Carter, who determines the budget, said
over $1 million is used for employee
salaries and an additional 32 percent for
fringe benefits. The remaining money goes
to consultants whom the SHS has
established a contract with for further
student medical needs.

Once the budget is determined, the vice
president of student affairs reviews it and

takes it to the president to be approved by
the Board of Trustees.

Although the fee provides for most
treatment, Carter said there are additional
costs students must pay for out of their
own pockets. “If more work is required in
determining treatment for an illness, such
as additional labwork, students must pay
for it,” he said.

Out of 44,000 student visits to SHS last
year, about 18,000 were walk-ins and
received assessments of their conditions
by a nurse who matched up their needs
with proper caregivers. The remaining
26,000 were appointments.

According to Carter, medical
emergencies were rare last year, and
surgery was last on the list of reasons for
students seeking medical assistance.

“The majority of students we saw needed
general medicinal treatment and care for
respiratory illness,” he said, “followed by
gynecology and dermatology check-ups.”

Carter went on to argue that only those
students who have illnesses that are
bacterial in nature receive antibiotics.

spends $1. 7in/zillion annually

“Some students that have a sore throat and
don’t receive penicillin get angry,” he said,
“and although some students might not
get treated the way they want, they are
treated well medically.”

Besides identifying student needs for

health service, Carter pinpointed alcohol
abuse as the No. 1 problem at Pitt.

“Last year we received a $115,000 grant
to support our substance—abuse program,”
he said. “We hired a counselor and
established PEAR, the Personal Education
Assessment and Referral service.”

PEAR works with abusers on an
individual basis to identify the problems
and refer the students to proper centers,
such as rehabilitation.

Carter also voiced concern over sexually
transmitted diseases on campus, especially
chlamydia and AIDS.

Currently, the SHS employs five full-

‘time physicians and three nurse

practitioners who together see the bulk of

medical patients. In addition there are two

full-time pharmacists and 10 nurses who

End of term
computer
lab waiting
problematic

By Kirsta H. Bleyle
Sta_[7' Writer

The computer labs will be quickly
filling up as the final date to turn in
term papers, projects and computer
programs approaches.

The best way to avoid crowded
computer labs is to go early in the
morning or late at night, David
Schatz, manager of the Computing
and Information Services, said.

Using labs which aren’t as busy,
such as the Bouquet Annex, will
also shorten the wait, he said.

“Last year during finals we only
had a l0—to-15 minute waiting list;
nobody knows about this place,”
Bouquet Annex ‘ student
programmer Ron Maclay said,
adding that there is usually an hour
wait at David Lawrence Hall’s
computinglab during finals week.

If a student encounters a long

waiting list for a printout,—Schatz
recommended printing from the
LPS40, which is considerably faster
than most lab printers.

To print from the LPS40, a student
must be using the DOS operating
system.

A user unfamiliar with DOS global
is free to ask a lab employee for
help, Schatz said. Lab employees
are expected to know how to turn
the computers on and off, answer
general questions and enforce CIS
lab policies, such as those
prohibiting food and beverages by
the terminals, Schatz said.

Schatz said employees are not
expected to be able to help with
programs for a specific course, but
they are expected to write down a
student’s questions and to get back
to that student when they have
received helpful information.

A new problem facing CIS lab
users this semester is the elimination
of a waiting list because of the
installation of hard drives on most
of the computers.

Before the hard drives, students
had to obtain a start-up disk from
an employee. Since the disks are no
longer used, students use the honor
system, allowing whoever came first
to have the first open computer.

David Lawrence lab employee
Rainer Mager said the lack of a
waiting system will be a real problem
this year.

“Whoever’s biggest will push out
the little people," Mager said.

Schatz said he asked the Student
Government Board for suggestions,
but no solutions were found.

“We don’t have any ideas on how
to handle this. We’re expecting it's
going to be very busy," he said.

Academic affairs committee tackles student problems

THE PIT!‘ NEWS, Thursday, -‘December 5, 1991

 

By Maureen Pfeifer
Staff Writer

So you've got a problem. Your
instructor is lousy, your books
are overpriced or the computer
labs are crowdedflhe Student
Government Board academic
affairs committee wants to hear
your complaints about Pitt,
according to committee chair
Chris Lapos.

“The committee is here to
improve the academic facilities,”
he said.

The committee offers a short

written survey about specific
complaints, which will be used
to convince Pitt officials that
problems exist.

Questions like, “Is it difficult to
ﬁnd a place to study?" and “Should
more information be provided
on course descriptions?” are
included on the survey. Students
have requested all-night study
sites that are well lit and safe,
Lapos said..

“The student union is open late
on Sunday nights, but it’s not
conducive to studying. The
Cathedral is open, but it is dark,”

Lapos said.

Lapos said the ‘committee is
interested in preparing a student
handbook of professor evalu ation.
Penn State has such a handbook
to help students choose courses,
he said. .

“I've had several professors I
didn’t like. I know they’re smart,
but in a learning institution you
have to have people who can
explain,” Lapos said.

The group is also trying to
organize a book swap before
next term because “book prices
are outrageous,” Lapos said.

Members of the committee are
not elected to their positions. The
SGB interviews for a chairperson,
who then interviews students

interested in joining the
committee.

Lapos said the interviews aren't
stringent.

“We’re looking for responsible
students with good ideas and
enthusiasm.” Students interested
in joining to just pad their resumes
need not apply, he said.‘

“I think we have the potential
to be a powerful committee,”
Lapos said.

Alumnae scholarship honors Pitt Women

By Franco Bonacchi
saw" Writer

Pitt’s Alumnae Association is once again
offering its annual scholarship. It will be
awarded to one female student entering her
senior year.

The Alumnae Association is a 76-year~old
organization made up of women graduates.
It established this scholarship in 1987 as part
ofPitt’s bicentennial anniversary celebration.

Donna Nativio, an alumnae member and

 

 

chairperson of its scholarship committee,
explained why her organization established
the scholarship.

“We primarily wanted to honor a young
woman who has worked very hard in her
academic program and is felt to be by her
faculty and by the dean of her school as an
outstanding student,” Nativio said.

The scholarship applies to all university
schools and majors, and each applicant will
be judged on three basic criteria, according
to Nativio.

First and most importantly the student
must be an outstanding scholar with high
academic achievements. She must have a
3.75 cumulative GPA in order to qualify.
Nativio said the student’s academic record
will carry the most weight with the scholarship
committee in determining a winner.

Second, the committee will consider the
student’s involvement in inner university or
community service, such as volunteer work.

Finally, the committee will take into account

Eeonomicsprofessor stresses irnportance of teaching

By Maureen Pfeifer
Stajf Writer

Despite his success as an
economist and author, Mark
Perlman’s students say their
professor’s priority is teaching.

When senior Morgan Marietta
started at Pitt, he wasn’t planning
on being an economist. Then he
met the man he simply refers to
as “the Professor.”

“Without question, Perlman is
the finest professor I’ve had at
the University of Pittsburgh. He’s
given me a love of economics
and a love of teaching.

“Perlman says, ‘If the student
hasn’t learned, the teacher hasn’t
taught,’ and that’s why I’ve taken
three courses from him and why

_ I’m taking another next semester,”

Marietta said.

Nema Patel met Perlman by
accident; he covered a class for
her regular professor. Patel’s was
so impressed that she’s taking
Perlman’s class on economics and
demographics this _ semester.

“He’s so obviously enthused
about economics and teaching it
cornés through,” Patel said. “I’ve
had one professor who compares,
but Perlman’s the best.”

The Pitt professor of economics
is listed in six different books of
Who's Who, including Who’s
Who in Economics and Who’s
Who in the World. Perlman
created and for 12 years was
managing editor of the journal of
Economic Literature to “help
practicing economists keep
abreast of the vast flow of
information,” he wrote.

Perlman produced some of this
“information.” He's written six
books, and "his resume’s
bibliography of just “selected”
articles is seven pages long.

The professor arrived at Pitt in
1963 after teaching at the
University of Hawaii and Cornell
and John Hopkins universities.
He earned a bachelor’s and
master’s degrees in economics
from the University of Wisconsin,
where his father Selig was a
professor of economics, and a
doctorate in, economics from
Columbia University.

Perlman’s been invited by
countries from all over the world
to lecture and teach.

But he stands out as an
instructor for reasons other than
his knowledge. Marietta said
Perlman invests a lot of time in
teaching. ’

“When a student writes a paper,
it is not merely graded and

rotate throughout the clinics. The
doctors and nurses, Carter said,
are selected by an in—house
search. ’

“Our doctors, nurses and staff
are all very competent,” he said.
“Our services make student visits
convenient and comfortable.”

Carter also expressed a need
for a larger facility than the one
currently located in Brackenridge
Hall.

“We need a place that is easier
to get in and out of,” Carter said,
“like across from the Law School

building.”

returned. He insists that the
student come and read the paper
to him aloud so that it may be
analyzed and discussed. It can be
a humbling experience, but in
retrospect it is a truly educating
one.”

Perlman said the professor’s
job is to “explain it another way”
until the student understands.

“He hasa way of making the
class easy and difficult at the
same time —— but it’s a success,”
Patel said. “If you geta B- in class,
he’ll write a little note on your
paper saying he wants to meet

with you. He wants to know
what the problem is.”

Perlman provides copies of the
lecture to his classes. The only
information that is missing are
his stories. And Perlman knows
how to tell a story.

“At ﬁrst I didn’t realize why he
was telling so many stories,” Patel
said, “but every story has a point
to it. He is really funny, and he’ll
tell us stories where he is not
always the person who comes

. out looking good.”

Perlman believes people can
produce a great deal “under

pressure.” Which explains his
response to Steve Surmacz.

“I mentioned to Professor
Perlman that I’d decided to quit
my part-time job because it was
interfering with school,” Surmacz
said.

“Perlman told me something
his father had told him, ‘Success
is biting off more than you can
chew and swallowing it.’”

Perlman has definite ideas on
how universities should be
preparing their students.
“Universities are for teaching and
learning. The faculty is here to
teach. If you want to do
research, go to a research
institute.”

In addition to learning in the
classroom, Perlman said,
“Students should learn how to
behave, be a member of their
community... and how to be self-
reliant. And also learn how to
study the world, their culture,
and how to understand
themselves.”

“He’s a true Renaissance man,”
Patel said.

“He knows about everything.
He’s with the times too. We can
talk to him about things going on
with us. He uses students as
examples.”

“Perlman is very realistic, very
modern, and he keeps up to date
with modern problems,” Marietta

said. “Professors more than
anything refuse to speculate on
thefuture; they study the past.
Perlman’s not afraid to speculate.”

Professor Perlman is concerned
that students don’t worry enough
about how “seriously they’re
being taken  Are they being
forced to do their best?” Perlman
said.

Perlman describes himself as
having been a difficult student. “I
challenged my teachers all the
time  One told me I was the
most arrogant student she’d ever
known.

“I told her, when you’ve been
chosen last for every athletic team
since the second grade, you learn
it,” Perlman said. “It’s not
necessary for the student and
professor to be friendly, but it is
necessary for each to understand
how the other thinks.”

Marietta said Perlman, unlike a
lot of instructors, is “uniquely
accessible.”

Perlman “pushes students to
learn,” Patel said. “And he’s a role
model. He’s brilliant and a
success. You want to be just like
him.”

“The mark of a true professor,”
Marietta explained, “is ‘when he
lectures overtime and nobody
realizes it. Nobody notices when
Perlman lectures overtime —— and
nobody ever leaves."

Student focus group studies campus computer labs

By Greg Molchan
Staff Writer

Pitt's School of Information Science has
organized a student group to explore the
possibilities of adding new computer labs
and improving the services of existing
labs.

The group, which is not affiliated with
Pitt, serves mainly to give the Computing
and Information Systems department
feedback on the computer system from
the people who use it.

According to Della Williams, computing
lab supervisor, the focus group is a forum
that encourages students as well as faculty
members to bring their problems to the

attention of the C15. The focus group then
can address suggestions for improvement
and take them to the department.

“We want to deal with the problems that
students and faculty members have and to
make the computing services the best they
can be,” Williams said.

Some of the problems that are currently
being addressed by the forum are the
possibilities of expanding the computer-
lab system to North Oakland.

According to Williams, it is not feasible
in the immediate future because of the
expense involved in instituting a
computer lab in the new dorms by Pitt
stadium. .

programmer who attends the group
meetings, said a major concern of
students is extending the hours of service
and increasing the amount of computers
to eliminate waiting to use the
equipment.

The group also addressed the difficulty
students have getting a Computer Accounts
Program account.

The CAP accounts are not currently
needed for word processing, but they are
needed for other functions, such as Mac
Global, which allows an operator to print
output on different computers around
campus.

In addition to discussing problems with
the computer network, the group also

offers suggestions regarding what software
it would like the CIS to purchase for the
network.

“This is an open forum for students to
discuss their own concerns with the
computer system, and there are no specific
topics for the meetings, " Assistant Manager
of User Relations Sharon Swaney
said.

Students and faculty are urged to attend
the forums with ideas and opinions. The
group meets three times a year, and the
meetings are usually less than an hour

Pitt examines nicotine’s
effects on body Weight

By Barbara Hoffmann
Sta_[f Writer

The University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine is presently
using smokers to study the effects of the nicotine in cigarettes
on a person’s body weight and eating habits.

Headed by Dr. Ken Perkins, the researchers isolate
nicotine from the 4,000 other compounds found in cigarette
smoke and administer it to participants in the form of a nasal
spray.

“We advertise very regularly because most of the subjects are
student volunteers who get paid,” Perkins said.

Perkins said there have been occasional studies done in the
past -—— about one each decade dating back to the 1930s — and
these studies did not ﬁnd a significant difference in a smoker’s
metabolism compared to the nonsmoker. But these studies,
according to Perkins, did not simulate the conditions in which
people smoke. '

All the previous metabolism studies monitored smokers
before and after smoking, but the participants were lying down
and not exerting any energy.

The University of Pittsburgh study found that when the
participants are active while smoking a cigarette, their metabolism
doubled.

“We have tried to simulate the conditions in which people
smoke,” Perkins said. .

Most people are engaged in light activity when they smoke,
Perkins said.

The participants in the study pedal an exercise bike
slowly to equal the energy they would expend doing
normal office work or other normal daily activities, he
said.

“Activity slows down the degradation of the [nicotine]
throughout the body,” Perkins said.

Degradation is the body process which breaks down a
chemical such as nicotine into a simpler compound and expels
it from the body. ' _

Because activity causes the nicotine to stay in the
body longer, the drug has a greater effect on meta-
bolism.

The nicotine also causes the body to release chemicals which
speed up the metabolism, Perkins said. '

Another study focused on how smoking and nicotine effect
eating habits and the body’s use of food after a meal.

“A lot of people smoke after eating a meal,” Perkins said.

' “Eating a meal causes the body’s metabolism to increase,” he
said.

The effects of smoking after a meal were not significant
because eating increases the degradation of the nicotine
throughout the body, Perkins said.

Because eating a meal causes the chemical to leave the body
faster, smoking after a meal has a lesser effect on the
metabolism.

“Each of these studies clearly demonstrates if you want to
know the metabolism rate [of a smoker], you have to_simulate
the conditions,” Perkins said.

wprc to study child abuse therap

By Richard Overmoyer
Sta_[flVr1'ter

Western Psychiatric Institute
and Clinic has been awarded a
$600,000 grant to study and
identify the most effective ways
to help victims and families of
child abuse.

The project, titled “Interventions
to Maximize Parent and Child
Togetherness,” will include a free
treatment program for abused
children and their parents.

“The goal of the project is to
provide therapeutic services to
families involved in physical
abuse,” said David Kolko, director
of IMPACT.

Kolko said a second goal of the
program is to learn how families
respond to different types of
treatment.

“Finally, we would like to
package or prepare a program
that can be used by others,” Kolko
said.

The program will be funded for
five years by the National Center
on Child Abuse and Neglect.

Patrice Johnson, project
coordinator, said families will be
referred to the clinic either through
teachers, counselors, hospitalsor

the courts. To enhance its efforts,
IMPACT will pay participants for
completing four research
interviews and for transportation
expenses.

“Our criteria is that there are
harsh discipline practices going
on and that the parent who is
disciplining and the child live
together," Johnson said.

IMPACT will provide services
for approximately 120 families
with children aged 6 to 12, where
physical maltreatment is
suspected. These families will be
placed into one of three treatment
groups. “They will go into the
treatment groups by a random
process done by computer,"
Johnson said.

Each group will follow a
different treatment plan. This will
enable the project’s staff to
research what types of families
respond better to certain types of
treatment. “We will be able to
look at family dynamics and

‘observe which families did well

in each treatment,”Johnson said.

Johnson said the problem with
child abuse is that it often goes
on undetected. “Sometimes the
abuse is only the outward sign
that there are problems. There

are often internal problems that
are brewing,” Johnson said.

IMPACT ’s approach is designed
to uncover the source of a parent’s
frustration. A clinical social worker
will visit the family weekly to aid
them in applying what they’ve
learned in their group to the
individual level.

Johnson said one of the most
difficult tasks ahead for the
IMPACT staff is to get the families
involved. An orientation program
has been designed to serve that
purpose.

“Orientation is for the parent
and child to realize that they have
to overcome the obstacle, that
this is a safe place for them to

discuss this issue and to take the

masks off,” Johnson said.

“Our goal is to teach people
that there are other ways to
discipline, other ways to get
positive results from their
children,” Kolko said.

The treatment groups will meet
once a week for 16 weeks. Upon
completion of the treatment, the
families will be evaluated after
one year and then after two years.
This will allow IMPACT to
measure the long-term effects of
their treatment and education.

Campus contributes to recycling drive

By Christine Hanna

About 5,000 telephone books were contributed
by Pitt’s Oakland campus for a recycling drive that
collected between 30,000 and 40,000 phone books.

Allegheny County Division of Waste Management,
Bell of Pennsylvania and Chambers Developing
Company sponsored the telephone book—collection
drive in Allegheny County during the past four

weekends.

Another 30,000 books were shipped from Ohio

Bell after it heard of the recycling project.
The drive didn’t collect as many as the groups
had wanted, said Don Berman, Director of the

Berman said.

However, “It was successful simply because we
did take phone books out of the [garbage] stream,”

The phone books are going to be shipped to Best

phone books as animal bedding because the ink

and paper in the books are more environmentally

neutral than in other paper products.

Move to remove sex from alcohol ads draws mixed reaction

By Kathy Kmiecik
Staﬂ“ Writer

Watch just about any sporting
event, and you’re bound to see
them — bikini-clad, young
women selling alcoholf

The United States Surgeon
General wants to change that. In
a recent announcement to the
press, Antonia Novello said she
plans to meet with executives
from several different alcohol
companies next month to propose
banning advertising thatlinkssex,
youth and glamour to sell alcohol.

Industry executives said that
while they will meet with Novello,
it’s unlikely they will change any
of their ads.

One industry spoke-srnan said

Junior S‘./:.r>tt (jrayder says, “it

wouldn't effect the kind of beer
Ibuy, but it would take all the fun
out of going to the beer
distributor.”

Advertising major Michael
Locke said, “The proposal will
never go through. Advertisers
know that sex sells. More money
is being put into advertisinginow
than ever before, and beer
companies aren’t willing to lose
the profits.”

Eric Farst, a Pitt student, said
he agreed.

“Ifyou cut outsexually explicit
alcohol advertising, then you have
to cut itout ofall advertisements,”
he said.

Most women saw the proposal
more positively. “I really don’t
think men believe that drinking a
certain lreer will get ‘them women

that even if the proposal were
enforced, it would be unlikely to
have ‘any immediate effects.
Jeremiah McAuliffe, director of
Pitt’s Health Offices Substance
Abuse Program, said that while
it’s a start, it’s not going to bring
any immediate changes.

“I’m glad the Surgeon General
atleastbroughtitup. Now people
will become more aware that it’s
a problem,” added McAuliffe. But
he insisted that eliminating sex
from ads will be a slow process.

“These images are already
deeply ingrained in today’s
advertising. It will probably have

more effect on the next
generation, who would be
brought up on this new

advertising,” Mc/\ulifl'e aaid.
Cheryl Campbell, adviser for

“I think people relate to liquor
and beer ads, she said. “It’s
obvious when you see how
students decorate their rooms
with them,” Campbell said.

DARE is a student—run,
volunteer organization that runs
programs aimed at educating
students about responsible
drinking practices.

“Patsy” "Bellisario, owner of
Mellinger’s Beer Distributor on
Semple Street, is not concerned
about the proposal effecting
business. He encouraged the
regulations.

‘‘I agree with the Surgeon
General,” Bellisario said. “I. think
they exploit women in those ads,
and they don’t need to do that to
sell alcohol.” .

Bellisario said  beer
advertisements he receives almost
always feature women. There
are posters featuring men,
according to I3ellisario, but sales
representatives are less willing to
supply them.

’I'hey say more men buy beer
than women, and men want
posters of women. But Bellisario
said that is not true. “You’d be
surprised how many girls come
in here to buy beer, and some of
them ask for posters of men,” he
said.

Melisssa Maroni, a Pittstudent,
said, “If beer distributors want to
use sexist ads, then they should
even it out and include men in
their advertising.”

One local brewery is not‘
worried about the proposal
effecting its advertising.
According to Michael Graham,
vice president of sales and
marketing at Pittsburgh Brewing,
the proposal has had no impact
on its marketing strategies.
However Graham said the
company has recognized the

issue as a sensitive one for some

time.
One of the company's recent
Halloween campaigns included

both men and women in the ads.
Graham said promotions for the
newest beer will, too.

“We understand the growing
concern about sex in advertising,
and we are beginning to move
away from it," Graham said.

Pittsburgh Brewing is also
interested in standing out from its
competitors, Graham said. That
means using advertising that
doesn’t look like everybody else’s,
he added.

Graham also said that because
Pittsburgh Brewing is considered
a smaller brewer, if the proposal
ever did become a law it could
mean many positive things for
the company.

Being one of the smaller
brewers in the industry means it
can't spend as much as the larger
competitors do on advertising.
So any restrictions on current
advertising Could cost other
companies a large amount of
money, but they would have little
effect on Pittsburgh I3rewir*.g,
Graham said.

Although Graham said he

doesn’t see the proposal ever

becoming a reality, he said he
does think it will lead the industry
to more self~governing.

He said currently there are no
writtenlaws to restrict advertising,
but there are several rules that
make up an unwritten code which
members of the industry
follow.

The most common one is that
no active sports personalities are
used in commercials.

According to Graham, this is
because these people are seen as
role models for many youngsters.
Their presence in the
commercials might tarnish that
image.

Another unwritten rule is that
the people in the ads must look
well over 21 years old and should
not be engaged in any sports.

The Surgeon General’s meeting
with industry executives is set for
Dec. 11. »

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Thursday; December 5, 1991

By Eric M. Smith
Stajf Writer

Leaving has become old hat for third-
time retiring music professorJ.H. Kwabena
Nketia

Nketia, who has been at Pitt for nine
years, will be heading off to a new job
within the month. ,

“I love music. I’ve been a teacher all my
life,” Nketia, 70, said as his hands came off
the top of his desk to turn palm-up. His
perpetual smile remained ﬁxed.

Nketia began his teaching career in 1942
at the Presbyterian Training College in his
homeland of Ghana. He soon moved to
the University of Ghana. In 1968 he joined
the faculty of UCLA as a professor of
music.

But he never quit his job at the University
of Ghana.

“I commuted,” Nketia said.

He worked at both universities on an
alternating—semester system.

At the age of 60 Nketia retired for the
first time.

He left the University of Ghana and set
up permanent residency in the United
States.

When Nketia retired for the second time
in 1982, from UCLA, he came to Pitt as an
Andrew W. Mellon professor of music.
Initially it was a temporary position, but
the university asked him to stay.

« Nketia was educated at the Presbyterian
Training College. -
He went on to the University of London,

.Birbeck College and the Trinity College of

Music.

He received a Rockefeller Foundation
Fellowship to study Ethnomusicology and
Composition at thejuliard School of Music,

Retiring music professor looks forward tofuture

Columbia University and Northwestern
University. _

Nketia said his early memories of
education include a feeling of separation
from his culture.

He was taught a foreign language, a
foreign history and western musical
traditions.

He said as he watched his country
struggle toward independence and emerge
from colonialism, he was instilled with a
strong desire to identify and preserve his
own culture.

He has spent a lifetime studying African
musical composition for the purpose of
understanding and preservation.

“I lived through several regimes, and I
survived all of them because they
thought my work is important. Culture is
important,” Nketia said.

Nketia has written and composed over

 

200 publications on the musical traditions
of Africa, including 15 books. He has
lectured at universities from Canada to
China.

After leaving Pitt, Nketia will teach a
semester at the University of Kansas and
then transfer permanently to the University
of Ghana, where he intends to fognd the
International Department of Africa.

Although Nketia is excited to start his
new job, he said he will miss Pittsburgh.
“The city is compact  it expresses a
strong diversity of culture.”

During’ his academic lifetime, Nketia
has also found time to raise a family. His
four grown children have given him five
grandchildren and a huge number of
frequent-flyer miles.

His wife has preceded him to Africa,
where he plans to spend the holiday
before starting work in Kansas.

Nativio said. T

Nativio added the scholarship
can be awarded for as much as
$5,000.

them about the scholarship.
According to Nativio, each dean

Not always a happy ending

As always, it’s been an eventful semester here in
Oakland. From the beginning of J. Dennis O’Connor’s
presidency to the much-opposed demolition of the Syria
Mosque, Pitt students have had much to confer about
between classes and while they were “studying” at
Hillman Library.

The saga of ex—Pitt President Wesley Posvar’s retirement
package was still a topic of hot debate when students
returned to campus in late August.

After a summer of scorn, Posvar decided to give back to
Pitt two of his perks, trying to clear his name and make
us see that he wasn’t such a bad guy after all. Too bad his
attempt was futile.

Also featured in the package scandal was Board of
Trustees Chairperson john Marous, who claimed in
September that he had no knowledge of the package and
its perks. Unfortunately for Marous, documents were
discovered which proved he had excessive information of
the particulars and, justifiably, several campus organizations
called for his resignation.

O’Connor was deeply scrutinized for the renovation of
his office in the Cathedral (even IKEA couldn’t resist
jumping on the bandwagon) and the remodeling of his
home in Shadyside. However O’Connor did manage to
purge himself and stay true to his “new era of openness”
by organizing forums at which students could probe
administrators about things that irked them about Pitt. He
also surprised the university community by announcing
the appointment of a student representative to the budget
and planning committee, which will allow students to
finally have some insight into where their (constantly
escalating) tuition money goes.

Last Feb. 1, Pitt made a drasticchange by making the

campus smoke-free. To‘ the delight of smokers, hired ‘

environmentalists decided in October to declare certain
office areas “safe” to smoke in.

For the first time in years, the Student Government
Board president finally lived up to his campaign promises
and the expectations of students. Responsible and
accountable, Brent Saunders leaves behind a trail that
might be difficult for incoming president Gil Golden to
follow.

Campus crime became the most popular issue on
campus after the sexual assault of a Pitt student last
month. Sadly, it took a tragedy to motivate our apathetic
campus, but turnout at SGB meetings nearly tripled. The
implementation of a van equipped with a cellular phone
arrived promptly, providing a much more efficient,
extensive and convenient service for students than the
North and South Oakland shuttle system controlled by the
Department of Public Safety.

The Pitt News would like to wish the university
community a happy holiday season. Congratulations are
also in order for all graduating students who manage to
find jobs in their intended fields.

Trina Pharr
CA5 '93
Reporter uninformed
I am writing to protest some blatant errors that
were claimed as facts concerning the history of my
native state. These errors were printed in Mark
Smith’s Pitt News article of Nov. 26 (p. 2) on the
separation of church and state. The statements
claimed that Maryland was founded as a “theocratic
colony” and that Catholics were “forcing Protestants
to leave,” and are outright lies[...l
As these gross misstatements of the truth were

[...l Maryland was never founded
as a “theocratic state” by Catholics
as Mark stated, and in fact they never held a
majority in the colony. ‘

It was founded by Calvert Family to provide a
haven for Catholics who fled from the horrible
persecutions in 17th-century England. The charter
for the colony was indeed held by Catholics, but it
was never the official or dorninant religion of the
colony.‘ I V  H‘  * 6- b

On the contrary, religious toleration was the
norm until the charter wasrevoked and the Church
of England was established in 1702'. A

That Catholics forced anyone to leave the colony
on religious ground is an outright lie. From the time
that the first Catholics settled in 1634, there was a
distinct toleration of other religious beliefs. These
notions were formalized into law in two distinct
acts, the First Declaration of T oleration (1639) and
again in the Second Declaration of Toleration
(1649).

In fact‘, the opposite is true. Despite pressure
from Puritans in the colony, the Calvertsvwelcomed
Quakers who fled religious persecution in
Pennsylvania, settling in Maryland in the 1650s.
The ironic twist of history is that after the Calverts
lost their charter (on religious grounds), Catholics
were disenfranchised until the American Revolution
(1776).

In fact, the Catholic ﬂight from Maryland in the
late 17th century contributed to the founding of
Kentucky (Daniel Boone, et al.).

While visions ofexams and term
papers pillaged his head

He was sleeping peaceﬁilly
In his South Oakland abode.
This one was passed out
Stone cold

But he heard a bump,

A bounce and a squeak.
Waking up, he cried, “What next?
I’ve been robbed twice this week!”
Of these criminals he decided

He’d had quite enough.
It was time to get mad,
Get even, get tough.

This Christmas there’d be

No silver bells

But his father’s Winchester And a
handful of shells. '

He spied the thief,

A red—suited elf with a sack.
He aimed his gun

And prepared to attack.

Old St. Nick set down

His bag of loot,

Turned to his host and said, “Merry
Christmas —— don’t shoot!”

Said St. Nick to this man,

“Put away that gun
And tell me what you want
For Christmas, my son.”

Said he to St. Nick,
“How about a tent?

My landlord is angry;
I’m behind on the rent.”

Old St. Nick gave him

A handful of dough

And climbed up the chimney
With a “Ho—ho—and-ho.”

Please don’t get ired
By my Christmas jeer.
Just have a merry one
And a happy new year!

Glover quits team; will transfer aﬁer semester

By Rob Pugliese and
Rob Mazur
T be Pitt News

Last year the University of Pittsburgh

and men's basketball head coach Paul .

Evans received a pleasant butunexpected
surprise when a sharpshooting guard
from Houston, Texas, named Tim Glover
announced he was going to take his
three—point shot and head north to
Pittsburgh. Yesterday, however, Glover
announced another surprise.

Glover has decided that after playing
for just over a year in the Panther blue
and gold, he is going to transfer at the
‘end of the current fall semester. However

he did not decide where he was going to
spend the remaining two years of
collegiate basketball eligibility.

“I’m leaving,but I don’t know where
I’m going to be yet,” Glover said yesterday.
“The only thing that’s definite is that I'm
leaving Pittsburgh.”

According to Evans, Glover will attend
a junior college and then transfer to
another school for his final two years of
eligibility. Evans did not indicate any
schools in particular but suggested Glover
would eventually play for a smaller
program. .

“He fee-ls that he’s in over his head
here, and he wants to play,” Evans said.
“Some kids are just happy to be at a big-

time school, but he’s a real competitor
and he wants to play."

At the beginning of this year Evans had
indicated that Glover was going to receive
more playing time at shooting guard.
Since last year’s starter, Jason Matthews,
graduated, Ahmad Shareef and Glover
were expected to battle for the starting
spot. However Shareef got the starting
nod in all the games so far this year up
until last night. Then first—year player
Jerry McCullough came on to claim the
starting job.

“It just didn't wbrk out for him, being
that far away from home,” his faLher,Larry
Glover said. “So he’s going to come back
home and work it out from there.”

McNeal cbews up St. Francis in 84-68 win

for 10 minutes of the first half due
to foul trouble, McNeal hit nine
of 15 shots from the floor and
also grabbed nine rebounds.
“McNeal had a steady game
tonight,” said Pitt head coach
Paul Evans. “For example, with
the three fouls, he still played
defense well.”

“We knew it was going to be a

“Both teams were bumping and

Dixon was hit with a technical

foul.

“I think that Pitt showed their
talent at that point," Dixon said.
“They began to show their

strength inside. They got some ‘

easy, inside buckets.”

Evans had a different
perspective, crediting the defense
with keying the run. “We had a
run because of our defense; we
went back to the man—to—man,”
he said.

Invitational

By Brian Gallagher
Stat)“ Writer ”

The Pitt swimming and
diving teams will play dual
roles this weekend, hosting
and competing in the sixth
annual Pitt Invitational at
Trees Pool. This year’s 10
participating teams
represent the largest ti. ‘.1

,in:lhe history of the event,

which began as the
brainchild of women’s head
coach David Belowich and
former men’s head coach
Fred Lewis.

Heading the list of teams
competing are the
University of Miami (Fla.)
and Harvard University.W
This marks the Panthers’
first opportunity to see the
powerful Hurricanes, the
Big East Conference’s
newest participant in
swimming. Harvard boasts
one of the country’s elite
programs, returning to
defend its 1990 Pitt
Invitational crown.

The rest of the field
includes the St.
Bonaventure University,
Miami University of Ohio,
Bowling Green State
University, West Virginia
University, Canada Laval,
University ofMaryland and
Air Force Academy diving
teams.

The format of the
invitational is unique in its
loose structure, which
allows teams to use all of
their athletes. There are no
limits on the number of
athletes each team can use
and the number of events
an individual can
participate in.

Belowich has found the
format to be beneficial to
his team as well as quite
popular with opponents-

Often, in the middle of a
sporting event, there stands
someone of size and respect. In
football and basketball, the
position is center. In volleyball,
it’s the middle hitter that fills
those shoes.

For the Pitt volleyball team,
senior co—captain Sue Zonneville
may lack size, but she has the
respect and definitely fills the
shoes of the middle hitter.

Zonneville, who stands 5-feet,
10-inches tall, is considered short
for a middle hitter.

“Most girls I play against are
six-feet tall or better,” Zonneville
said. “I have to be quicker and
smarter,” she said about her secret
to beating taller opponents.

Beating those foes has earned
Zonneville respect. She was
named to‘ the Big East All-
Conference team this year.
Zonneville has been a steady
force within the Panthers’ middle
attack. ,

With these accomplishments
and years of experience
throughout her past, Zonneville
is a middle hitter worthy of notice.

Growing up in Rochester, N.Y.,
Zonneville began as a gymnast,
but in junior high school she
turned toward volleyball.

“I wanted to play team sports

in junior high,” Zonneville said,

about her attraction to the game.

Over the next few years,
Zonneville attended several
volleyball camps and played for
her Rush-Henrietta High School
team. She also played soccer,
basketball and track for her alma
mater.

However club volleyball in New
York was where'Zonneville got
plenty of experience. Her team
travelled, allowing Zonneville to
showcase her talents for -any
interested college recruiters.

smarts eamrespect-

Those recruiters included
Florida State, South Carolina,
Rhode Island and Pittsburgh.
Zonneville’s decision to attend
Pitt was just a chance happening.

“I was walking down Forbes
Avenue, and I realized I wanted
to come and play here at Pitt,”
Zonneville said.

With that quick decision, the
Panthers gained a solid,
dependable player destined to
be successful — a player who
would win fourvarsity letters and
become an eventual team leader.

After an ankle injury slowed
Zonneville during her sophomore
year, she came back stronger
than before in her junior season.

She led the Panthers with 555
kills and a kill percentage of .346. '

Zonneville had a miniscule 91
hitting errors scattered throughout
some 785 hitting attempts.
Coming into her senior year,
Zonneville and fellow senior Dee

MacAulay rwere elected co—'

captains for the 1991 season by
their teammates. This elected
status did nothing to change
Zonneville’s character of play.

For T be Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh’s
football team scaled walls,
climbed Over mountains and
overcame adversity to produce a
winning season after last year’s
dismal performance.
Unexpectedly, it was the youth,
the sophomores and first—year
athletes, who played a key part in
the team’s turnaround.

These heroes were pleasant
surprises to both the players and
the fans. I

In the two years under Pitt’s
head coach, Paul Hackett, the
recruits have provided not only
hope for the future but also great
play to lead the team to victories
this past season.

One might remember back to a
Saturday in Minneapolis, Minn.,

when first—year running back
Curtis Martin rushed for 170 yards
and a touchdown. Redshirt
freshman Bill Davis returned a
blocked punt for the winning
touchdown, as Pitt went on to
beat the Minnesota Golden
Gophers, 14-13.

In that game, like many others,
it was the young players who
were directly involved in creating
a victory.

After 1astseason’s 5-7-1 record,
many thought the young players
would get a chance to play, but it
would not come against a
winning, competitive team.

.Hackett said when he was

recruiting he was able to Offer an
opportunity to start at Pitt, and
many players have taken
advantage of Hackett’s offer.

. Enter Martin, the starting
running back who only played

football during his senior year at
Allderdice High School. Martin,
who led the team with 735 all-
purpose yard.

He revitalized the Pitt running
game, which looked doomed in
the off—season due to the losses
ofCurvin Richards to the National
Football League and senior
Ronald Redman to Achilles’
tendon surgery.

Martin’s success is not only a
surprise to fans, it is also a surprise
to himself. “I didn’t ever think I
was going to college," he said.
Martin had to overcome
numerous injuries in high school,
but he finally got his chance to
play in his last year.

Martin said he came to Pitt
because he liked the tradition of
the football program and the
environment. “When I visited the
campus, it was like the team was

a big family,” Martin said.

He attributed some of his
success to running backs Coach
Skip Peete. Peete was a big help
to Martin, who had to adjust
quickly to the college level.

Another player who had a
tremendous impact on the play
of the team is sophomore strong
safety Doug Whaley. Whaley was
second on the team with 86 tackles
and second in interceptions with
four.

Whaley has quickly made a
name for himself, and Hackett
has said he is a possible future
Academic All—American. “\X/haley
is the complete student—athIete
and is the type of player we want
more of at Pitt,” Hackett said
about \X/haley, who has a 5.25
GPA.

"lfl were to tell you last June
that we would be six and four

Recruits stepltofrom in wmningfootbczll season

-ByGeorge Klimis

  

when we played Penn State, you
would have thought I was crazy,"
Whaley said. He's right. Pitt was
not expected to do well this
season, but it started outwith five
straight wins.

Whaley attributed the team’s
success to leadership. “This fall
the seniors pulled the team
together like a family and gave us
the leadership we needed — we
were lacking,” he said.

Whaley graduatedfrom nearby

Upper St. Clair High School. He ‘

said the reason he came to Pitt
was because it was close to home
and because he felt there would
be an opportunity for him to
play.

First-year player Tom Tumulty
has also been a surprise on the
defensive side. Tu multy, an inside
linebacker, has teamed up with

according to plan.

“ILewis and Belowich] thought
Of a f ormat where everyone could
participate," Belowich said, “and
the December event we were
competing in, the Penn State
Relays, was a little frustrating
because it didn't have distance
events and IM events.”

Needless to say, the popularity
Of the meet continues to grow.
Over 380 athletes will participate
in 40 events, starting Thursday
evening at 7 p.m. with the 1,650-
and 800—yard freestyle relays.

The favorites of both men’s

‘and wOmen’smeets will be
Harvard and Miami, Fla. The
Harvard men have a 3-0 dual-
meet record with wins over
Columbia, Navy and Army. The
women’s team is also unbeaten.
The two schools combined for
the top seeds in 31 of the 40
events. Harvard has the top seeds
in all but two of the relays, while
Miami, according to Belowich,
boasts “the best men’s and
women’s divers in the country.”

Pitt menls swimming assistant

. coach Mark Davin is looking

forward tocompeting with the
Hurricanes for a variety of reasons.

“It’s going to be fun swimming
against Miami because of their
entry into our conference, ” Davin
said. “It’ll also be interesting

because their coach, 1‘nyself and
Coach IChuckI Knoles are close
friends. That will make it even
more exciting."

The Pitt men have only one top
seed this year: seniorjoe Kozlina

in the 2OC>—yard freestyle. ’l'he_

men will need a full effort from its
entire squad to be successful.
That could be difficult this
weekend due to a variety of
injuries that have plagued Pitt
within the past two weeks. NO
less than six Panthers have
substantial injuries, ranging from

shoulder problems to a
tonsillectomy. .
As for. the women’s

expectations this weekend,
Belowich said he is concerned
most for his fIrst—year athletes
and how they handle this preﬁnals
meet. “I’m most worried about
the freshmen because this is their
first set of ﬁnals and the meet
runs directly before finals week,”
Belowich said. “Because of that
aspect, I’m not too concerned
about where we finish in the
meet.”

Instead Belowich said he will
look for a more patient approach
tocompeting. “I would like to
see us continue to make progress,
like we did in the Virginia meet,”
Belowich said. “If we continue
what we started at Virginia, l’Il be
satisfied.”

around the conference.

Zonneville’s smart play and
plenty of hard work have made
her a little “taller” on the volleyball
court. Her middle opponents
don’t look so big anymore. Her
“big” shoes have certainly been
filled.

sophomore linebacker Charles
Williams to form one of the most
promising middle-linebacking
corps in the East.

T umulty was third on the squad
in tackles (84) behind Whaley
and Williams. “Tom is great to
have on your side. He is very
emotional, and it gives a
tremendous lift to the team,
especially the defense,” Whaley
said about Tumulty.

Williams, who is only a
sophomore and leads the team
with 92 tackles, has been a great
influence, especially when it
comes to leadership. “Charles
kind of took me under his wing
this fall. He has been a
tremendous help to me my first
year,” Tumulty said.

Tumulty, one of the most—highly
recruited players in the country
last season, was a Parade All-
American and was rated as one of
the top 10 linebackers in the
country.

He said the reason he chose
Pitt over the likes of Penn State
and Notre Dame was because of
the tradition of great defensive
players and because he has always
been a Pitt fan.

“My heroes as a kid were Bill
Fralic and Tom Flynn, who both
went to my high school,” Tumulty
said about the Pitt All—Americans
that graduated from Tumulty’s
alma mater, Penn Hills High
School. “The most tempting thing
that attracted me to come to Pitt
was the chance to play quick,” he

said.

Other players who have had a
major impact on the team are
redshirt freshmen wide receivers
Chad Askew and Bill Davis. These
players have become intricate
parts of Hackett’s passing offense,
which at the beginning of the
year was minus All-American
candidate Olanda Truitt, who
transferred to Mississippi State,
and senior Darnell Dickerson,
who was declared academically
ineligible.

Also helping offensively is first-
year player Dietrich Jells, whose
28.5 yards per reception led the
team. Redshirt freshman Reuben
Brown, a Parade All—American
while playing defense in high
school, switched to offensive line
during fall camp and moved into
a starting role near the end ofthe
campaign.

All of these players have made
the most of their opportunity to
play at Pitt, whether it has been
on special teams or starting.
“That’s the beauty: There was
plenty of opportunity, and they
went out on the field and played
as true freshman,” Hackett said.

The fact that there are so many
young players creates a lack of
experience at many positions,

’ and that is what separates Pitt

from most Top 10 teams. But
with so many young players
getting so much play early, that
would give llackett a great
foundation to build on. Possibly
Pitt has a natjonal—champion team
in the making. '

News Editor

To most Pitt students, South Oakland means little more than high rents, crime and substandard,
overpriced apartments. But for the Italian immigrants who settled there, South Oakland is home.
Panther Hollow is the setting of Elvira DiPaolo’s Bricklayers, which opened at the
new City Theatre on the South Side last week. DiPaolo’s loving tribute to the South
Oakland Italians of the neighborhood she grew up in is marked by clever, natural
dialogue and strong acting. »
In Bricklayers the three DeFilipo brothers are forced to deal with their Old World
traditions eroded by modernity. The ways of the Italian village of Fontana can’t survive
* in an urban jungle.

Bricklayers Pete, Sal and Vincey Deliilipo run the construction
company started by their father, dead a year when the play opens.
Pete (Robert Marinaccio), the oldest, is married to Lympia (a stellar
performance by Shirley Tannenbaum), and is feeling his age and
changes he can’t comprehend.

Ingenuous Vincey ‘(Carl De Gregorio), the youngest,

swiftly falls in love with Marina, a beautiful Italian seamstress

who speaks little English. Marina, who has just arrived in
America, is kept under strict control by her uncle Umbi.

_As Marina Kelly Panczyk deftly handles her thick accent

and transition from silence to independence. David Howard as

.-\...>.

decline of traditional family values: “Respect —— that’s just a word
now.

Outrage against the university’s penchant for buying out Oakland
also emerges in the play: amid much protest Pitt purchases the Italian
men’s club that Umbi belongs to.

The familiar complaints of the South Oakland Citizens’
Council echo as well: Umbi shouts about those “Pitt-a students”
throwing beer bottles on his lawn and stealing the statue of the
Madonna from other people’s yards.
Tony Ferreiri’s set is a dreamlike vision of the row houses
that line Oakland streets. and Cindy l.amauro’s lighting is stark
and powerful. Larry John Meyers directs this strong cas_t with
a keen sense of timing. _

De Gregorio and Panczyk tenderly fumble through their love
scenes, and Tannenbaum and Marinaccio give depth to the problems
in their bruised marriage. The strongest member of the cast is John
Amplas as Sal, who has the difficult job of mediating between the old
and the new.

City'Theatre picked a fine, locally significant play
to open its new building, reconstructed from an old
church. It's about time this superb theater company
had a good space to produce in.

In the pitiful City Theatre building on the corner
. , ._ _ , of Bouquet and Sennott streets, an usher was always
   -I‘ V - ' stationed by the women’s rest room to make sure

' : patrons didn’t fall down a ramp in from of the door. Sometimes a
leaky roof and electrical problems threatened to stop performances.

This won’t happen in the new building, which has more seats, a
large lobby, no structural hazards and a beautiful design.

Bricklayers runs through Dec. 22. Call //3 I-/1//00
for more information. Half—pricetickets are available
for students and senior citizens I 5 minutes before
the production.

A noizy break with Cop Shoot Cop nd Jesus Lizar /.~

By MC Lingo
Staff Writer

Let us blast off with an apology
and then begin the briefing. Dec
11. brings us national rock at an
uItra—low price. On sale now:

Cop Shoot Cop. What was once
an expensive high has become
available to all shoppers. This
N.Y. unit is big, cinematic,
grandiose —— even siren—fiIled -

continues to rail against the buy/

tactics that place us all in a certain

 How to spend your time and ducats during break

F‘.

l

o

By Brian Berger

and Mike Sula
T be Pitt News

For those of us lucky enough
to spend the winter break in the
Pittsburgh area, the entertainment
division of TbePz'ttNew5 has come
up with a plan of attack. Herein
lies a guide of how to spend
some of your time and money
over the holidays. If you don’t
follow our plan, Santa will know
you’ve been good.

Friday, Dec. 6. The
Manchester Craftman’s Guild
keeps the faith with it’s second
concert of the season, a swingin’
quartet featuring jazz legends
Louis Bellson on drums and
saxophonist Jimmy Heath. Local
Dwayne Dolphin play bass, and
Dave Budway pokes the ivory.
It’s a swell lineup that reeks of
tradition. Call 322-0800 for the
scoop. _

Saturday, Dec. 7. Music, art,
freedom and white guilt are the
themes for the Mawa Festival for
inner freedom, which features
comedian Mr. Hemp, Rusted
Root, Ras Prophet and others at
the Benedum Auditorium in
Oakland. This time around the
show beneﬁtsome of Pittsburgh’s
homeless. For a nightcap, head
to the Graffiti for food metaphors
and cutesy, poetic indie rock
with King Missile, which returns
for its 17th (a guess) gig in the
‘Burgh this year.

 Sunday, Dec. 8. “What about
the theory that we live our lives
over and over again without
change? God, I’d hate to see the
Ice Capades again” —— Woody

Allen. Well, it ain’t the Capades, A

but it’s your last night to catch
Walt Disney’s Wonderful World
On Ice, "a spectacular two shows
in one at the Arena, Goofy.

Monday, Dec. 9. Get angry.
Join a movement.

Tuesday, Dec. 10. Don your
Trojan and leather skirts, and
wheel yourself down to the
Pittsburgh Playhouse for the
classic, naked-gladiator film,
Spartacus, with hot ‘n’ steamy
new footage. Stanley Kubrick
directs this 1960 beauty.

pummeling, the geetars anything
but jangly.

The first noticeable difference
between new Helmet and old
Helmet is the buffed-polished
vocal quality of this 7-inch. Hell,
there’s even some harmony. No
more a-gurglin’ for Page
Hamilton; it’s honest to goodness
octave hopping. “Unsung” is
where the jagged and jutting
Helmet left and the doughy and
chewy Helmet took over. The
thumbing, stop-n-start bass/drum
thang is still omnipresent along
with the drum/guitar duo deal
between choruses.

On the b-side, “In Your Head,”
the drums are subdued and a bit
mufﬂed, and the vocals screech
at times. Yell, “Gimme some
bass,” and Henry Bogdan will.
Pittsburgh-bred john Stanier’s
drums seem to be the mainstay
of this single, pounding till the
earwax seeps out ofevery orifice.

It seems they have learned
something ‘bout engincering—n-
production whilst on AmRep..I
don’t mean to imply that the
single is thoroughly digestible,
but it won’t be as long ofa sit on
the commode as Strap It On.

Lush
l’our—song Maxi Single
/{AD '

Aside from the generic
reference that conjures visions of
sanitary napkins, there is nothing
impure about these three new
songs. (One is a remix ofthe first
cut.) Well, at least there aren’t
any that I can understand. Lush’s
utopia is one where instruments
thread together to form looping
swirls, pinwheels spin to the beat
of halocd angels and boys sound
like girls. It’s a pretty euphoria
yet a haunting Eden (not like
/LAD labelmates His Name Is Alive
but an incestuous romance with
My Bloody Valentine). It’s the
kind ofplace you wanna be when
your eyes are droopy and your
body tingles. Too bad you can
only decipher a hand full of
words.

“Nothings Natural" swims with

transparent vocals and pulsating
 somethings. Modulated winds
blow east, and hooking synthetic
guitars take swooping nose dives.
It’s an electronic wonderland, very
reminiscent of the entire Gala LP.
But that’s Lush, and like Galaeach
song sounds like the next, which
isn’t a bad thang ifyou’re in la la
land.

“God’s Gift” is no change either,
except this time the words are a
bit more comprehendible. It’s got
the English-accent, tambourine-
slappingecho thing coming atcha.
It sort of reminds me of a
respectable Three O’ Clock
comeback with Miki Berenyi’s
iridescent whispers.

“Monochrome” should be a hit
at make-out parties with its
delectable caramel dripping at
slo-mo. One can spend an entire
evening rewinding (between
oooohs) to transcribe what the
hell she is singing.

Reflecting on past Lush
endeavors, I don’t expect a full-
length LP for months. This EP is
Lush at its dreamy best, a plasma-
pippler that serves as a soothing
lozenge for soupy ears.

Slayer tbroag/9 eyes
of the metal queen

Slayer
Decade Of Aggression
Def American Recordings

\X/e’ve all heard the hype
surrounding Metallica’s new
album. Celebrating 10 years
together, the band has released
its most commercial—sounding
disc to date, alienating die—hard
fans but at the same time drawing
in new ones.

And some of us have heard
about the 10-year anniversary of
Motley Criie, marked by the
release of a mostly remixed
greatest-hits package.

But how many fans are aware
of the third L.A. band (yes,
Metallica was‘ originally an L.A.
band) to celebrate its 10th? This is
a band that, in its own way, has
set as many heavy metal standards
as the first two bands I’ve
mentioned.

The band, of course, is Slayer,

celebrating in true Slayer style
with the release of a live double
CD, Decade Of Aggression. No
overdubs, just straight-ahead live
music. Taped during two different
tours — the headlining tour that
brought them to the Mosque last
winter and last summer’s Clash
Of Titans Tour, these discs sound
every bit as angry and ferocious
as Slayer does live. But then that’s
the point, isn’t it?

Disc one kicks off with a live
Slayer rarity, “Hell Awaits.” From
the start of the mystical opening
notes, we get to hear the crowd
roaring, cheering, chanting,
“Slayer! Slayer!” From there it’s an
almost too-fast rendition of the
classic, but that’s what live
performances are all about.
Liberties with time (kept as always
by drummer Dave Lombardo),
with solos (there don’t seem to
be many of those from guitarists

Nation of Ulysses: Young Dischord
revolutionaries who are not unlike Fugazi in
sound but are more literate and have a better plan
of action as described in the “I3-Point Program
to Destroy America.” Ulysses is the sound of
young America.

No more jitterbug, American Bandstand or
Solid Gold, and more importantly no more sleep.
Saxes bleat all around yo head, out of tune/time
and sounding all the better to meat yew with.
Correct?

Bikini Kill. Gurlie non-dirge from K to Olympia,
these lasses offer up sparse rock to pet by. In
league w/ notables Go Team or Beat Happening,
they are guaranteed never to show up in a great
Russ Meyer flick. Ever, never. It also showcases
local usedtabehalv-lifers in what is now the
metalcore sound of Facer as well as old-school p-
rock from the Barbed Wire Dolls. Locals, yokels
and moguls  yew buy.And the sale continues
on the 17th of December, unchecked.

Jesus Lizard. The band tours relentlessly, proving
that the great ones kick it live when it counts. By
now the history is very old news, and the only
thing that matters is that the big walla—wa-boom
ofthe Lizard gets heavier, tighter and more  uh,
uh  Presence-like, le’ssay.

(Give a listen to “Royal Orleans” er “Candy

Store Rock.” It’s true, by gumm. Could be the
Lizard, right?)

Mr. Yow and Co. rock like no other, and if
fatties like-yunselves miss ‘em again, then yer,
how you say  dumb?

Wreck. Chicagoan guitar damage on Wax
Trax, y’say? Yes, it’s true. Wreck is kin to its name,
rattlin’ out good—enuff sonic spillage ta bend ears
even w/ straight-giggers at the house 0’ wax.

Loud snarls of heavy-distorto guitar and turbo-
boost bass give Wreck ‘nuff credo to hang w/ the
Lizard. Need I say mo’?

And if that wasn’t all a gullet could digest,
howzabout the two best metal bands in the city?
Doomwatch spills out old—wor1d chunks o’ rhyme,
big and heavy in the bottom department, while
relative newcomers Blunderbuss ache out mid-
tempo grind better than equal to recent Am Rep
musings.

It’s at simple world, see, and I’ve got tha simple
answers, George.

Dec. 11 it’s Cop Shoot Cop, Nation Of Ulysses,
Bi/eini Kill, Facer and the Barbed Wire Dolls at
the Upstage Lounge for an all-ages show. Then on
the I 7th it ‘s ’['ouch’n Gas, The Jesus Lizard,
Wrecle, Blunderbuss and Doomwatch fora throb-
/illed gig at the now-famous Upstage. MC Lingo
remains at large, wanted by the Feds and the
dictionary police.
