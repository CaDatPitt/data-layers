This action, to the union, sig-

SGB unanimously  

eliminates committee

by Lindsay Carroll
Senior Staﬂ Writer

Student Government Board unani-
mously eliminated the freshman affairs
committee at a meeting last week.

The decision came after a request from
its committee chair, Trista Polaski, and
board member liaison Ryan Haddad.

The voteat Tuesday’s meeting came af-
ter the issue was brought up at the SGB
presidential debate earlier this month,
when allocations chair and president-
elect Kevin Morrison and board member
Amanda Reed said they would eliminate
the freshman affairs committee if they had
to choose one.

Polaski said she supported the board
and felt there was too much overlap with

“It’s_ not that I don’t feel freshman af- .

inside Student Government Board.”

Haddad said with all of Pitt’s program-
ming for freshmen, the committee has be—
come less useful. .

“We give [Polaski] a title and a job, but-

everything she does is kind of redundant
because the University does so much al-

and apartments to celebrate.

Last'year’s Backyard Brawl was momen-
tous not only because it was the.l0Oth Brawl,
but also because Pitt foiled the then—No.
2-ranked WVU team out of the Bowl Cham-
pionship Series.

Groves said Pitfs victory over WVU was
a bigger deal last year. »

“We had a winning season this year. But ’

last year it was like, ‘Ha! We can be happy
about one thing,”’ he said. .

And Pitt students were happy. There are
multiple groups on Facebook.com dedicated
to people who joined or “survived” the riots
after the Backyard Brawl last year. Students
posted pictures and videos of their peers
chanting and burning couches and chairs
during the celebration.

€ 5 '
You've got a long way to get me to call
it a riot. A riot is when no one listens
and there is total destruction. When_I
do tell someone to put that down, and

they do, ‘it's not a'riot. '
Tim 9 9

Delaney

Pitt police are ‘riot’ ready

Pitt police chief Tim Delaney said that
he is wary_ about calling these post—game cel-
ebrations “riots.”

“You’ve got a long way to go to get me to
call it a riot,” he said. “A riot is when no one
listens and there is total destruction. When I
tell someone to put that clown, and they do,
it’s not a riot.”

Over the years, Pitt police have developed

‘strategies for how _to control celebrations.

Delaney. said that the police typically let the
celebrations go for an hour or two. Of the
thousands of people who run around after

big games, 99 percent of the participants en—.

joy themselves without causing any trouble,
said Delaney. , V

Groves remembers the celebrations after
the Steelers won the Super Bowl.

“Seeing people out celebrating, that was
cool,” said Grove. “But then people started
ﬂipping carsand then set them on ﬁre.”

Groves said he thought people went too
far by destroyingyproperty. During the cel-
ebration, people ripped a store awning and
destroyed parking meters. .

However, Groves said that this sort of
behavior is common on other college cam-
puses.

Delaney still believes that Pitt students
overall are well-behaved and that_the few in-
dividuals who light couches and cars ‘on ﬁre
are not representative of the student body.

He urges students to not burn things be-
cause it is dangerous and, he thinks, idiotic.

“It’s arson, and that’s a felony,” said Dela—
ney. “We will not cut anybody a break in
those situations.”

In Pennsylvania, arson by way of reckless
burning is a felony of the third class. Rioting
is also a felony of the third class.

Pitt police use 12 to 16 ﬁre extinguish-
ers to stifle ﬁres, and the'City of Pittsburgh
sometimes provides its police  more.

In anticipation of a post—Brawl celebra-

 

tion this year, Pitt police istationed 16 ofﬁcers
at Heinz Field and 12 ofﬁcers in Oakland.
They regularly monitored the student section

and had the power to send students to the '
judicial board for minor infractions that are -

not punishable by law. V
The police were also ready to ‘close off

’ streets like they have in past situations:

Delaney said that when the police block
off streets, they are giving students permis-
sion to gather. '. '

said that the police are getting better at han-
dling these large—scale celebrations.
I This year, students ran through the streets
when Pitt’s football team beat the Univer-
sity of South Florida, when the Philadelphia
Phillies won the World Series-and when Ba-
rack Obama won the presidential election.

“I didn’t anticipate the celebration for the
presidential election, and I’m a product of
the ’60s,” said Delaney. “That was the ‘happi-

_est crowd I’ve ever seen.” '

The Board opened to receive complaints
onJuly 15, 1998.

“A lot of people said we wouldn’t be
here for a year, and now here we are, 11
years later,” said Pittinger.

Pittinger said the Review Board was a
“huge victory” for civil and human rights
activists who had concerns about the Police
Bureau’s state.‘

“There was an absence of structure and
an absence of accountability,”~ she said.

running, but that doesn’t mean
that riders should be breath-
ing any easier. Last Tuesday,
the leaders of the Amalgam-
ated Transit Union’s Local'85
‘ and the administration of the
Port Authority reached a tenta-
tive agreement over employee
contracts that defused the pos-
sibility of a transit strike. But
despite this agreement, the
Port Authority’»s situation_is still
grave, and it’s too early_to say
that this new contract will solve
any problems. _

The rank-and-ﬁle members
of Local 85 still have to vote on
ratifying the settlement, as does
the Port Authority board. But
because neither party is will-
ing to discuss the contract until
after voting, it’s impossible to
even gauge whether the union
is likely to accept it. If it votes
it down, the negotiations will
have to go on, _and that keeps

real.

Even if the union mem-
bers do ratify the contract,
that doesn’t solve any of the
problems still plaguing the Port
Authority as an institution. The
pensions of the drivers might
be contractually secure, but that
doesn’t change the fact that the
Port Authority is losing riders
and money. .

needed to balance the expenses
include a projected $212.1 mil-

cantly increased the amount of
money that Pitt and Carnegie
Mellon pay for students to ride

tion the service cuts enacted
in 2007 and the fare increase in
January-

. The fact of the matter is
that-the -Port Authority is in
dire ﬁnancial trouble. Even

though the union probably .

won’t strike, that doesn’t mean
that the problems facing the
company have all gone away.

Rather, the potential con-
tract resolution islsimply a pre-
lude to what the Port Authority
is going to be dealing with for
the next several years, espe-
cially if it continues to run its
ﬁnances like it has in the past.
And keeping in mind that the
current agreement is only ten-
tative and could still be voted
down only makes the situation
more worrisome.

It’s safe to say that the only
thing that can help the Port Au-
thority at this stage is a drastic
shift in terms of strategy and

ﬁnancial "policy, but unfortu-
‘ nately, this seems unlikely. The

union members certainly aren’t
going to give up their pension

plans, the managers can’t be '

expected to have their salaries

frozen forever, and nobody in '

the city wants to go without

The management of the

Port Authority needs to take-

ﬁrm steps toward reconciling
the demands of its union with
the desires of the riders and
their own ﬁnancial reality. This
might mean more fare hikes
and route_ cuts, as well _as more
Port Authority employees los-
ing their jobs. Tuesday’s tenta-
tive agreement might have re-
duced the possibility of a strike
for now, but that doesn’t mean

ny leaders — should be anyvless

TI-rEEDrroR  

To the Editor, .

I’m not really sure where Josh Green was  to go in his Nov 25 column, “Force all hea-
thens to celebrate Christmas.” He starts off by observing that some stores are forbidding their em-
plbyees to wish customers “Merry Christmas,” then goes on to mention the American Humanist
Associations catchy new ad: “ Why believe in a god? just be good for goodness’ sake”

But by the end of the column, this somehow translates into the idea that militant  are
trying to force people to celebrate Christmas. I don’t get it On the contrary, the evidence suggests
that militant atheists and relativistic multiculturalists are to squelch Christians’ freedom to
express their beliefs. Can you imagine the outrage if the Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh put up
signs saying, “Buddah is stupid.’Believe injesus”? But for some reason, it’s not intolerant if the .
AHA wants to say “God is stupid. Just be educated,” which seems to be the general gist of their -
advertisement. I’m all for a healthy pluralism, but that involves entering a dialogue with the beliefs

of others, not  them out of a false sense of “tolerance”

Four Christmases and not one funny joke?

Stczﬂ Writer

Four Christmases

Starring: Vince Vaugn, Reese Wither-
spoon

Director: Seth Gordon

New Line Cinema

On the first day
of Christmas, my
true love gave to me
a lukewarm holiday
comedy that fails to
deliver the holiday spirit.

“Four Chri_stmases” revolves
around Kate (Reese Wither-
spoon) and Brad (Vince Vaughn),
the type of sickeningly happy

 

‘couple that makes. even the big-

gest romantics want to vomit.
They’re' content with their life-

style of contrived perfection in
San Francisco, and despite their 4

farnily’s gentle prodding, they re-
fuse that marriage is a good idea
(undoubtedly a testament to both
having divorced parents). Instead,
they live together and indulge on

an annual tropical vacation each
Christmas while their dysfunc-
tional parents think that they’re
doing charity work.

Unfortunately, this year a fog’

rolls in over California, and Kate
and Brad have to put Fiji on hold
until the weather clears. Whﬂe
pleading with the check-in desk, a
news anchor asks them for an‘~in-_

terview, putting their real vacation
plans out for all to see. \X/hile 
on the air, the two start getting
calls from their anxious parents,
inviting them to four separate
Christmas celebrations.

So a clay of family-instigated
mortiﬁcation and headaches en-

‘sues. vEmbarrassing childhood

and Kate take turns getting physi-
cally and mentally assaulted by
their families. Their parents and
siblings might be humiliating, but
they are pretty funny.‘ Lucky for
viewers, they’re mean. enough to
trigger a few chuckles.

The day begins with Brad’s fa-
ther (Robert Duvall) and brothers,
a group of crude men obsessed
with ultimate wrestling.

The following visits don’t get
any better. Kate’s seductive_ female

be because the movie only runs
a little more than 80 minutes, it’s

nearly impossible to invest in their _

troubles. This would be forgivable
if the comedic parts, were fun-

* punch lines provoke cringes be-

Though few honestly anticipate‘

much from a movie with puking

and Witherspoon, who both have
created fairly devoted followings
from ‘romantic comedies. Why
can’t there be a Christmas ver-
sion of “Wedding Crashers” or
“Legally Blonde”? And why were

almost all great Christmas movies '

made before 1995?

By the time the last of this

season’s wrapping paper and pine

’needles ‘ have been swept away,

“Four Christmases” will long be
forgotten. If you’re looking for a

Panthers take Legend's tourney

by Adam Littma.n_
Se/zior Staﬂ Writer
, NEWARK, N.].— After sitting
center Dejuan Blair in a win against
Belmont, the Pitt men’s basketball
team traveled to New Jersey at full

health for the ﬁrst time all year. A

That health helped lead Pitt to a
dominating performance in the
second-ever Legend’s Classic.

Blair missed the game last Tues-
day with a swollen knee, but he said
he could’ve played and his absence
was more precautionary than any-

 else. Conversely, the Panthers
welcomed back sophomore swing-
man Gilbert Brown, who had
missed every game of the season
so’ far with a stress fracture in his
left foot.
, V “He brings some athleticism to
the team,” said Levance Fields.
I Brown played each of Pitt’s last
three games, looking like the same

explosive player who started 15
games last year for N 0. 4 Pitt.

“It was good to see him play,”
said Pitt coach Jamie Dixon. “I’m
really comfortable with him out
there.”

Luckily for Pitt, Brown came
back just in time to play against the

V best competition it has seen so far’

this year.

The Panthers (7-0) took home
the trophy of the tournament, de-
feating Washington State on Satur-
day night 5743. Texas Tech bested
Mississippi State 77-73 in the con-
solation game.

“These are four very good
teams,” said Dixon. “I wouldn’t be
surprisedif all four. teams made the
NCAA Tournament.” '

Sam Young won tournament
most valuable player honors, while
Blair made the all-tournament
team. Texas Tech’s Trevor Cook,

Mississippi. State’s Kodi' Augus- '

tus and Washington State’s Klay
Thompson ﬁnished out the team.

Not only did the tournament
allow the Panthers to play against
tougher opponents than it had
seen thus far, but it showed their
versatility as they were able to de-
feat both the highest scoring team
in the Big 12 (Texas Tech) andthe
top defensive team in the Pac-10
(Washington State).

“Right now we’re doing enough
to get a win, but we’ve got a lot

of improvements to make,” said '

Young. “We haven’t reached our
full potential. We’re not even close
to our peak.”

should weigh options

by Tony Ferraiolo
Senior Staﬁ’ Wrder

 

Thanks to Pitt tailback LeSean McCoy,
the day was saved. , I A

The season will continue, and fbr the
time being, so-will offensive coordinator
Matt "Cavanaugh’s job (although U-Haul
should probably keep Cavanaugh’s contact
information on ﬁle). - \

McCoy led Pitt to its second" consecu-
tive victory over bitter rival West Virginia in

the 101 st installation of the Backyard Brawl ‘

19-15.

‘Perhaps McCoy should have been hon-
ored with the seniors at Heinz Field on Fri-
day for senior day. After a rousing 33—carry,
career—high 183-yard rushing performance,
in which McCoy eclipsed Larry Fitzgerald’s
Pitt record for touchdowns as freshman
and sophomore (34), nobody would blame

Shady if he decided to moon walk on the '

statement he made earlier in the week.
McCoy’s dominating performance came
on the heels of media speculation that Pitt’s
star running back was _a lock to leave school
and enter his name in the NFL Draft next
year: McCoy abruptly- ended the hearsay.
“I’m not going anywhere,’_’ he said.
After his career-best performance, who
could_blame McCoy if he reneges on his
standing? - . ‘
‘Maybe he should. . .
_ McCoy’s performance on Friday reaf-
ﬁrmed what everyone already knows: He’s

Too bad Cavanaugh almost forgot. '

Against West Virginia, McCoy repeat-.

: tinued to churn out yards, especially when
1 Pitt needed them the _most.‘ Despite his
'33 carries, which »‘might' seem high from

Bill‘Stull’s pass toward Jonathan Baldwin
was intercepted, and West Virginia trailed

sively in the ﬁrst half.

Later, in the second half, after Jovani
Chappel intercepted a pass from West
Virginia quarterback Pat White, McCoy
pranced in on two carries. Needing the
two-point conversion to draw even with
8:07 left in the game, a false start moved
Pitt back to the 7-yard line.

In another -play Cavanaugh drew up a
quarterback draw for Stull. At the time, no-
body on the ﬁeld was playing worse than
Stull. Stull had just thrown an atrocious
interception to nobody in particular and
looked to have lost his conﬁdence. Yet with
a chance to tie the game, the.Pitt coaches
put the ball in Stull’s hands instead of Mc-
Coy’s. "Needless to say, the play went no-
where, and Pitt trailed 15-13. It looked like
Pitt might fold. I

’ Instead, the Pitt coaches took their smart’
pills, and McCoy took over the game.

As the Panthers embarked on their ﬁ-
nal drive, they faced a second-and-12 with
the game hanging in the balance. McCoy
treated Panther. fans to a little art in motion,
taking the misdirection pitch of the right
edge and slashing -upeﬁeld when there ap-
peared to be no room to operate. But Mc-

Coy pickediup the first-‘7down that ultimately  '
sealed back-to-back Backyard Brawl victo—’   "
'ries. Two plays later, McCoy set a career-

high in rushing yards.

“We kind of wanted it more,” said Mc-
Coy. “In that huddle, man, in a game like
this, you don’t have to say too much. You
look in everybody’s eyes, they’re like ﬁre.”

Perhaps a potential disaster could have

discussed the game plan with McCoy. *
“I think any player,_in my situation wants

[the ball],” he said. “Ina game like this, you‘ '

kind of want it. Theiriiore carries I get, I
get stronger. When you got the horses up
there, blocking the way. they were blocking,
you want the ball.” _ ‘

West Virginia might have been well-
suited to give White, itsbest player and the
NCAA’s all-timei‘leadeir’i11 rushing as a quar-
terback, .tl1eeball_tnoi::e than the 12 times
that he carried it.-2. .  ,

Regardless  anyone says, a per-
formancelike the one’-‘McCoy turned in on

g Friday is going to_rnake it tough for him
 "to elude the NFL Draft. And you certainly

won’t hear any complaints from the West

Zellous, Wilson help drive Pitt to impressive yvveek

1", by Sergei F elclman
Sta_/]"' W/rite/°

~ Hosting the Pitt Thanksgiving

Tournament, the women’s basket-

ball team had consecutive victo- .

ges against the Elon Phoenix and
Youngstown State’ Penguins to cap
off a championship weekend.

Pitt 84, Elon 49

Pitt opened with a strong effort _,

Friday afternoon, punishing the Elon
Phoenix with an 84-49 victory.
Despite opening the game with
‘two consecutive turnovers and early
fouls oniboth ends of the court, Pitt
controﬂed -the scoreboard. ':An.early
ezeir-1-4 run set the tone for the Pan-
thers, as they held the lead through-
out the game.

Freshrnan center Shawnice “Pep-
per”W1lson used herpowerful 6-feet-
6-inch frame and handled the paint
with two early baskets Her presence
in the paint helped Pitt’s open jump
shot looks and perimeter shots.

Standout senior point guard
Shavonte Zellous didn’t fail to make
her presence felt in the first half ei-

 

ther. Two 3-pointers highlighted her
first-half play. She entered the half
with 12 points..

Some of Pitt’s errors kept Elon
in the game But midway through
the first half, the Panthers got their
act together and went on a dominat-
ing17-3 run. ' '

Coming off the bench, another
freshman, Kate Popovec, followed

in W1lson’s huge footsteps, scoringin _

both the paint and at the free‘-throw
line Popovec ﬁnished the first half
with a memorable 11-point perfor-
mance ’ ‘

“Kate just dominated,” said Ber-

enato. “She just swept. It was really ‘

exciting to see that.”T
Production on the offensive side
of the court helped, but for Pitt, a
strong defense equally contributed.
The Panthers‘ forced 12 turnovers
and controlled both offensive and
defensive boards, outrebounding
Elon 19-12.
i “We had great defensive pres-
ence,” said Berenato. ‘ 1 \
Things looked dim for Elon for
much of the half, but play balanced
out in the last five minutes.

Pitt closed the half with a narrow
15-12 run and walked into halftime
leading 44-28.

Knowing Elon would not walk
away without a ﬁght, Pitt came out

. prepared for the second half, jump-

ing out to a 29-12 run. A defensive
adjustment ended any. hope of a
Phoenix comeback.

“We went to a 2-3 [zone],” said
Berenato. “That. was the key. Our

zone was terriﬁc, and it put them on 1

lockdowrr V
Zellous led all scorers with _'22

points

Pitt 99, Youngstown State 41 Y,

. Pitt put on a’ dominating, deja-.
vu effort against the Penguins from
Youngstown State on Saturday after-
noon in the championship game of
the  Tournament, win-
ning 99-41.

Wilson played to her down-low
strengths, setting up Pitt’s first five
points of the game, including a slick

9 move to the rim that resulted in a

three—point play. .
Sophomore guard Taneisha Har-
rison catapulted the Panthers to a

23-12 run to openthe game with
a 3-pointer. Harrison finished the
game with 16 points.

But Youngstown State sliced Pitt’s
lead to eight points with a 3-pointer.
The shot instilled some life in a de-
ﬂated Penguins attack Hoping to
build on whatever momentum they
gained from ‘the shot, the Penguins
picked up the physicality.

“We knew they were an aggres-
sive team,” said Berenato. ‘They re-
ally body you up.”

But Pitt didn’t shy away from
the toughness. In fact, at one point,

9 ' Youngstown State head coach 

 screamed out atact_ic’to stop
Wﬂson at the center position. -‘ *

“If she keeps pushing you, push
her baclg” she screamed at her play-
ers

if Tempers ﬂared on both benches,
but the momentum nevertheless
shifted toward Pitt.

Zellous had a lot to do with that
again, ﬁnishing with 20 points for the
game. ‘ '

The Panthers carried a 44-22 lead
into halftime

Assuming any life remained for

of intensity,” said Berenato, referring
to the team’s sluggish ﬁrst—half start

second half] .”

The rout—of-a-run was aproduct
of a sound defensive game

“The whole second half we

In addition to two victories, the

Panthers collected all-tournament

accolades. Both Wilson and Xenia
Stewart were named to the all-tour-

crowned the tournament’s most
valuable player.

“I was glad both of our seniors
[Zellous and Stewart] were on the

The sophomore now has 1,308 yards
and 20 rushing touchdowns on the sea-

His 35 total touchdowns break Larry
Fitzgerald’s record for most scores by a

more seasons.
Pitt coach Dave Wannstedt said he
knew how key McCoy would be against
West Virginia.

“Great players make great plays in big

' games,” said Wannstedt. “I think that was

the difference in the game, particularly

when we were struggling throwing the

ball. Our only chance‘ to win was to play
defense and run the ball. We were able to
do that.”

threw an incomplete pass to Wes Lyons
past the end zone as time ran out.

Pitt quarterback Bill Stull was 12-of-23
for'156 yards, a touchdown and two inter-
ceptions. . .

He admitted that Saturday wasn’t one
of his best days.

A “That’s why it’s a team game,” said Stull.
“It just so happened we ran the ball every
time that last series- Our guys up front and

   
   
     
   

 
     

on the defense won the game for us.”
White ran for 93 yards and _a touch-
down while adding 143 yards through the
 Running back Noel Devine ran for only
17 yards on 12 carries. B
Pitt scored on its opening drive for the
second straight game, when Stull found se-
nior receiver Derek Kinder for a 30-yard
touchdown. It was Kinder’s first touch-
down since Pitt’s opening-day loss to
Bowling Green.
_ But just like last week’s loss to Cincin-

. nati, the Panthers didn’t score again until
V ‘the fourth quarter.
“We need to find a way to keep doing.

the things that we do on the first series of
games,” said Stull. “If we do that, we might
get darn close to a perfect game.”

i The,Panthers drove inside the Moun-
taineers’ 5-yard line with time running
down in the ﬁrst half. .

But on second—and-goal, Stull lobbed
a pass toward the corner of the end zone
that was underthrown and intercepted by
Quinton Andrews. -

Pitt’s defense held White, college foot-
ball’s all—time leading rusher as a quarter-
back, in check until midway through the
third quarter.

— Trailing 7-6, White used his athleticism 5

to break a 54-yard touchdown run with

6:05 left in ‘the third quarter. The snap on .

the extra point was bobblcd, and Pitt fell

— behind by five.

Pat McAfee then connected, on a 40-
yard field goal, his third of the game, to
give the Mountaineers a 15-7 advantage
with 11:53 remaining in the contest:

Jovani Chappel. intercepted a White
pass after Pitt was forced to punt, and Mc-
Coy ran for a 5-yard score two plays later.
Pitt~we_nt for two to tie the game, but a
Jason Pinkston false start penalty pushed

A the Panthers back five yards. A quarter-

back draw failed, and Pitt remained down

, 15-13. .

The Pitt defense held again on the next
drive, leading up to the winning possession
that carried toward the core of the Pitt fan
base.

“It was great for us to score going to-
ward our student section at the end,” said
Wannstedt. “Our home crowd deﬁnitely

played a part in keeping our players into‘

the game and  us an advantage, par-
ticularly down the stretch.”
Pitt plays Connecticut next Saturday

in a game that determines Pitt’s bowl slot. "

A chance remains that the Panthers could
play in a New Year’s Day bowl, the Gator
Bowl, or perhaps the Sun Bowl a day ear-
lier. — A -

The Red Raiders hung around with the
Panthers throughout much of the ﬁrst half,
leading 27-24 with about four and a half min-

utes to go.
But Pitt soon took the lead for good after

Young drove to the basket and passed to Tyrell ‘

Biggs for a wide open dunk. Young then hit a

p 3-pointer to give Pitt a 29-27 advantage.

Pitt ended the half on a 13-0 run, capped
by a layup by Jermaine Dixon, who went un-
der the hoop and tossed the ball high off the
glass. 1 - V
“To end like that in the ﬁrst half was a big
boost for us,” said Blair.

The Red Raiders (6-1) cut the lead down to
three early in the second half but just couldn’t
overcome the deﬁcit.

Young led all scorers with 24. points, and
he also had eight rebounds and four. assists.
Blair hauled in 11 rebounds to go with his 15
points. Brown was the only other Panther in
double—ﬁgures, scoring 10. Brown also pulled
down eight rebounds, as did Biggs.

Pitt had 16 turnovers and 16 assists. _

“We could’ve cut down on the turnovers,”

said Dixon. “That was a bit uncharacteristic
for us.”

Pitt 57, Washington State 43

For lovers of offense, this was a hideous
game. But for the Panthers and Cougars (5-1),
this was the type of game both teams were

built for: a low—scoring game in which practi- _

cally no shot went uncontested.

“They want to have the ball more than
you,” said Dixon. “They have a football men-
tality.” - .

The Panthers ﬁnished the game with more
combined blocks and steals (19) than made
ﬁeld goals (17). '

“You couldsee us getting better, getting‘

smarter as the game went on,” said Dixon.-

Young once  led the team in scoring, 1

bounds. Fields ﬁnished with 14 points, hitting
a few big shots down the stretch to clinch the
title. ' V

suited him just ﬁne, McCoy’s injury caused
big programs to lose interest. If he stays

in college and something similar happens,
the ramiﬁcations this time around would .

be far greater. . - .

Heinz Field for the last time as a collegian,

there was an announced sellout for a Pitt
game. McCoy set a career—high_in rushing
yards, rescued Pitt from obscurity and,
most importantly, beat Pitt’s bitter rival for
the second straight year, severely damag-
ing the Mountaineers’ national standing.
“For me, I’m 2-0 against West Vir-

rivalry is. VWC beat them last year [and] did
a lot of damage to their program.”
