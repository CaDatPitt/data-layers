A A.R.A. Platform

P.P.P. Platform

ListsConstitution Suggests iAlumni

As First Plank   St. Union Fund

by LINDA GOLDSTEIN
(See Editoria.l—Page Four.)

The Association for Representative Action (ARA) and the Pitt Progessive Party
(PPP) have announced their platforms for the forthcoming Student Government (SG)

election.

Using the theme, “Consolidate, Innovate, Advance!” the ARAi'made the 'following.
declaration: The ARA is dedicated to the Principle that ‘ Student Government Should
be composed of responsible students whose actions and goals are representative of the
Pitt Student Body. The primary purpose of Student Government is to faithfully repre-
sent what the students want, not what a self-seeking fringe thinks they should Want. We
seek to represent all of the students, and claim ‘no allegianceto a single campus faction.”

“A Program for Positive Action” introduced the PPP platform, which stressed the
following point: “The University is in a process of change. We are in need of dynamic
student leadership to clearly express student opinion concerning that change. Students
must be considered before decisions directly affecting student life are made. This year,
the students have the opportunity to finally make their ‘student government the vital
student organization on campus . . . with dynamic, concerned leadership.”

Highlights of the ARA Platform include:

> A representative and effective implementation
of the New Student Government Constitution
will be our first goal.

> SG should maintain active student participation

in all University, Planning, Expansion and Poli- '

cy Making.
> The 10 per cent City Amusement Tax should
be removed from University events such as

Homecoming. ‘ 4

> The University should realize the special needs
of the oﬂ’-campus students and provide unique
facilities for them:

a. All full-time graduate and undergraduate
students should permitted to eat dinner in
the Towers Cafeteria every day.

b. More lockers should be obtained for the Ca-
thedral Basement and Ground Floor—space
is available.

 > SG should establish an Oﬁ-Campus Housing

Committee to work with the Director of Off-
Campus Housing and to inspect, evaluate, and
publicize apartments and rooming houses in

the Oakland area which are available to Pitt

students.

> The Book Center should remove the restrictions__

on returning textbooks. Students should be per-
mitted to return textbooks in good condition
without a change of course slip.

The PPP Platform made the following points:

'> To hasten the construction of a new Student

Union, Student Government, in cooperation
with the Student Union Board, should approach
the Alumni office to establish a Student Union
Fund_ '

> The President of 'SG should urge the SG presi-
dents of Pittsburgh colleges to initiate a city-
wide campaign to equip all parking spaces sur-
rounding campuses with four-to-eight hour me-
ters.

> A student should be appointed by SG to the
University Planning Board toclearly articulate
student needs.

> SG should, in close co-operation with MDC,

"Housing Board, and IFC,. investigate student
feeling for housing on the hill and should joint-
ly communicate the ﬁndings to the adminis-
tration. '

> Books should be returnable to the book store
upon presentation of only the cash receipt. No
book in the university book store should be sold
at more than list price. —

D SG, with MDC, AW_S, and IFC, should work
jointly to obtain scheduled visiting hours on
weekends forwomen students in male rooms
in the dormitories and fraternity houses.

I» Late fees on academic invoices should not be
charged until after the ﬁrst day Of Classes.

7-1 2Week Courses
Effective April 24 

by MARSHA REHNS

The trimester system will op-
erate as of spring, 1967, with a
spring term consisting of two
seven and one-half week sessions
and with subsequent smaller cal-
endar changes in the fall and
winter terms, Acting Chancellor
David Kurtzman announced to-
day. The revisions were approved
by the Board of Trustees yester-
day.

The "revisions will be in effect
through the spring term of 1968,
but. the decision whether or not
to retain the '“three-term sys-
tem,” as the trimester will now
be called, will be made on the
basis of the success of the 1967
spring term, Dr. Kurtzman said.

The spring session will begin

‘with ﬁnal registration,«April 24, p
1967, and continue until June 15.

The summer session of the spring
term will run from June 22 to
August 12_ Classes will begin
again Sept. 7. The Christmas holi-
day of the 1967-68 term will ex-
tend from Dec. 21 to Jan. 8.

' -Courses will be taught four

minutes during each seven and

the Schools of Liberal Arts, En-‘
gineering, and Education. Some
, especially those w1t_h
laboratory work will remain on
the present 15 week arrangement 1”;
as" will some of‘ the remaining
schools and graduate divisions.
Students may take as many
courses as they are able under "
the four day a week schedule,
Dr. Kurtzman said. ‘Tuition will
probably be charged on one-half“,
of the present basis. Facilities
willlbe made available as enroll '
ment demands it, he continued._
David Smith, assistant to thef:
vice-chancellor o-f ﬁnance, stress
ed that ,a greater number of:-_i
courses in all disciplines than in
any previous spring.term will be,
offered. (A complete survey of
these courses will be given in.
next Wednesday's Pitt‘ News.)
Dr, Kurtzman praised the new
system because of its “potential ,
for enrollment expansion.” It will.
enable some freshmen to enter;
the University during the second
session. The ﬁrst session will be‘
geared to undergraduates, the
acting chancellor explained, -but‘=
the second session will eliminate"
the need for a separate summer
school since public "school teach '

 

leges will be able to attend.-
“Many students may be encour-3..
aged to study for two a.nd.one-‘:
half terms,” he said. , "
°‘ There will also be the oppor-
tunity to have visiting professors”,
during the second session, Dr"
Kurtzman said. None of these ar. ,
rangements were possible when
the 15 week spring term began
in April, before the second term“:
of other universities and high}:
schools was ﬁnished.  ,
A committee of the Faculty
Senate, headed by Dr. David 
dy, which proposed the revision .
has been studying the trimester"
system since a year and a hall
ago. At that ‘time a Ford Foun
d-ation ﬁnanced report found the
system economically unsound A
because less than 50 per cent 0,
the number of credits taken by
undergraduates during the fall‘o‘r..
winter term were taken during A?
the spring term. _ _
The three term system is being A
continued this year in order 
see if the tuition reduction and
calendar revision make it mo
attractive to students, Dr. 
man explained, Only a “substan
tial increase” of about 50 
cent of the number of students
formerly attending the spring
term will make it practical.

Winter “Transfer Students

’67 Sees New Faces

By BERNIE MCLEOD

“I just figured out what’s different this term,” re-
mark_ed a senior the other day. “Aren’t there an awful lot

of new faces around here?”

According to Jack Critchfield, Dean of Admissions,
there are a large number of transfer and re-located students
starting at the University this winter term. As compared

to January, 1967, 118 have en-
rolled. Actually admissions re-
ceived 385 applications for the
winter term, of which they ac-
cepted 130.

“This nearly 75 per cent. in-
crease in transfer students over
last winter,” said Mr. Critchﬁeld,
“is undoubtedly due to the re-
duction in tuition. A great ma-
jority of these people are Penn-
sylvanians, and many of them
Pittsburghers who had attended
other colleges for several years,
and ﬁnally came back_” *

Dianne Farber, a, Pittsburgher
and formerly a student at Keuka
-College, in New York State, is

one of the January transfers. “I
transferred,” said “Miss Farber,
‘fbecause Keuka didn't have a
full political science department
and I wanted to major in the
ﬁeld. I must admit, though, the
lower tuition at Pitt did help me
decide on coming here. A I
Among the new students’ ’on
campus are the many re-locates
from regional campuses, such as
Kathie Mattern and Carol Burns,
both from the Johnstownn area.
As a whole, they like the Univer-
sity, but feel that it is slightly
harder to get acquainted here.

Page 4 — THE i>ri'r Niiws —' weaneaaay, January ii, 5.954: t I V.

The Association for Representative Action (ARA) has -presented a
succinct, rational" platform with planks that could certainly be implement-
ed through student pressure. The Pitt Progressive Party (PPP), on the
other hand, chose to present a lengthy document which includes a series
of “pie in the sky” proposals.

The right approach, for example, is taken by the -ARA toward the
Activities Fee Allocation Committee. Their platform suggests that the
administration should not be a part of allocations discussions until the
students committee has ﬁrst had a chance to meet in private. We heartily
endorse the removal of the administration’s “Big Brother” at allocation
meetings and we believe that action by Student Government (SG) can
result in a policy change. « .

While the PPP states that graduate students must be represented

I on the Allocations Committee if they begin to pay the fee, the ARA is

one step ahead on this subject; The ARA suggests a referendum to see if
graduate students even want to be «charged for the fee.

Rather than drag their feet by presenting proposals from past cam-
paigns, the ARA has come up with several new planks which are worth
investigating. Their platform raises the problem of the 10 per cent city

1». P. P. P .  InTiheSk

badly in need of reevaluation. 5

The PPP has obviously bitten off more than it could ever hope to
chew. Its platform is loaded down with 28 planks,, some which have sev-
eral parts. Anyone reading the platform would quickly realize there is
enough proposals for three Student,Governments and could. only guess
which part of the platform a PPP administration would work for.

In some cases the PPP platform deals with fait accomplis, such as
changing parking meters which are .already-installed; at other points they
propose ideas which have demonstrated to be ﬁnancially unrealistic such
as hiring a. full-time secretary for SG. Further PPP proposals are simply
extraneous, such as their “University Committee to discuss student life.”
The Student Affairs Advisory Committee already exists with the repre-
sentatives of the student body, faculty, and administration.

, The PPP document is a catch-all for anything and everything that
might appear in a SG platform. There has been no sifting out of what is
plausible and important and what isn’t. We can only admire the manner
in which the ARA has focused their attention on a select group of logical
planks. Ultimately, we are shocked that the PPP, which has experienced
student leaders for advisors, could have produced a platform which dem-

 
  
  
   
   
   
  
  
  
   
  
   
  
   
    
    
   
    
    
   
   
    
    
 
   
  
  
    
  
    
  
 
  
    
   
  
   
  
 
   
   
  
  
   
   
   
   
   
 

 S. U. Elevators

I WALKED through the
Student Union entrance and
I ‘went straight toward the
elevators. It was near dinner
1‘ -time' andboth elevators stood
waiting as I walked into the
nearest one and pushed “4.”

I waited, but nothing hap-
pened. The elevator remain-
ed dead with only the “4”
button showing any sign of
life. What seemed like an ex-

ceedingly long time passed,
" but still the elevator remain-
ed dead.

Being a person who ac-
, cepts very little, especially

’ -things with obvious faults, I
qdecided to do something
_ about this unfortunate situa-
tion. I exited and entered
 the second waiting elevator,
pushed “4,” and then waited
for something to happen.
‘ And something hid happen
 shortly! '

I TO MY CHA_GRIN I heard
 the noise of closing elevator
doors accompanied by a ding.

elevator sped upward with
no one in it.

After awhile it came back
down and opened its wide
th11I1,8‘1'.Y doors for its next

victim. But in the meantime,
 the second elevator remain-.

led-dormant with me inside
in an exceedingly irritable
_. mood. I wasn’t about to let
the elevators get the best of
me again. _ .
t fSIN CE THE other eleva
_tor went up ﬁrst before, it
would have to do so again;
elevators are machines and
7' they can do things only in
the one way in which they
were programmed to do
them.
« I returned to the original
elevator, pressed “4,” and
waited. Again nothing hap-
‘pened. Then (you guessed
it)-,' I heard the ding, the
doors close, and again I had
lost to the machines.

I stood -helplessly as the ﬁrst

, amusement tax on University events and increased locker space for com-
muters in the ‘Cathedral basement. ‘ _
The crucial issue of the Committee on Recognition of Student Or-
ganization is also thrown out by the ARA. We feel the purpose of the
Recognition Committee (which is not discussed in the PPP platform) is

TheTwinDemons Letters to the Editor

By Robert Zavos

BY THE TIME it return-
ed, I was ready to boil over.
It was a good thing that no
one -had come by to view this
exceedingly embarrassing
situation, for I felt like hit-
ting somebody.

Determined not be a three
time loser, I waited in the
elevator. Still nothing hap-
pened. Maybe if I pushed all
of the buttons, the computer
would send the elevator up.
in a ﬁt of rage I pushed
every single button on both
panels of the elevator.

BUT NOTHING happened.
Finally I walked out to sur-
vey the situation. I stood be-
tween the two elevators so
I could jump in the ﬁrst one
to start up.‘ .

The doors on the one with
all the buttons pushed be-
gan to close and with quick
reﬂexes I dived in. Appar-
ently, the electric eye no-
ticed an intruder about to be
wedged between the doors. A

-signal quickly opened the
doors and I sat waiting, but
they didn’t close again. When
I ﬁnally picked myself up,
nothing had happened, so I
exited and pushed all the
buttons in the next elevator.

WELL, BY this time I was
slightly irrational and when
I heard the ding and doors
close, I began to beat my
lists against the wall.

I ran out of the elevator

‘ and up four ﬂights of steps

so fast that I’m sure I beat
the elevator which had to
stop on all ﬂoors. I _, would
like to apologize to the per-
son who got into the elevator
with all the buttons pushed,
especially if he had to go to
“9.” And I also advise him
to follow the same policy
which I now advocate; name-

him. He stood up slowly, walked
toward the deserted lobby feel-
ing nervous, tense, over tired,

pared for all his upcoming ﬁnals.
To top it all, his family was up-

These symptoms are far too rep-

Anyone who goes to college

ﬁts" that go along with ﬁnals no

His roommate, who _had spent
most of his vacation at parties,

his ﬁnals and spending hour upon
hour at the typewriter ﬁ_nishi.ng

No matter when ﬁnals come,
there will ‘always be some who
have to cram, even during a
lengthened ﬁnals period.

The editorialist has a very
good idea in that the professors

should be given _more time to I

Hoop Coaching

Editor, Pitt News:

Having come from that hotbed
of roundball, Philadelphia, I have
observed the college basketball
situation for several years, and I
have a couple reactions to Tom
Sacks’ column about Pitt basket
ball (Jan. 6).

Philadelphia has ﬁve major col-

current Pitt team and yet have
never suffered, to my- recollec-
tion, so poor a record as last

year's 5-17 ‘or the 7-16 of the-

year before. This year is not
destined to be much better.
There are two reasons why
they have been more successful.
For one, each of the ﬁve
schools has a coach who teaches
his players imaginative and in-
ventive basketball. But more so,
they instill in their players pride

in the game and a winning spir- .

it. Neither is evident on this
year’s Panther team. _

There is, however, nothing Bob
Timmons nor any other coach
can do about the other reason.
Big Five teams win because of

fan support. Philadelphia’s Pal-.

estra is notorious for wildly en-
thusiastic fans causing visiting
teams much grief. No _complaints
will ever be heard from visiting
squads around Fitzgerald Field
House.

Take note from the current
team at St. Joseph’s College in
Philadelphia. There is one real
goodballplayer on the team, The
rest are equivalent to Pitt’s tal-

ent or in most cases worse. The ‘

coach is in his ﬁrst year. But St.
Joseph's has pride in the sport

coach is daring and imaginative.

games against a tougher sched-
ule than Pitt’s That’s twice as
much as we’ll win all year.

The fact is, that strong fan
support often makes good coach-
ing look great. Pitt hasn’t got the
fans. More important though is
that Pitt hasn’t got the good
coaching to begin with.

-29 games, 1725 yards gain

Pitt, it’s refreshing to take note of those both past and
present who have added their mark to the Panther sports

, Jim Flanigan, All-East linebacker, ended his days as an
amateur athlete when he captained the North defensive
unit in the Senior Bowl at Mobile Saturday.

'— » , Because of the Panthers’ poor record
this year Flanigan ’didn’t get half the hon-
ors he deserves.

< wick, said, “He’s got to be oneiof the best
' middle linebackers in the country. I think
he outplayed every linebacker we faced
this year, and that includes Lynch of No-
tre Dame.” Flanigan had 53 unassisted tac-
kles and 93 assists this year.
Last Sunday" Flanigan was honored by
the Curbstone Coaches as Pitt’s most val-
“ . -uable player during the past season. Hon-_
:ored that night along with Flanigan was junior Bob Bazy-
lak. He received the award for the outstanding scholar-
athlete in" the Tri-State area.

Panthers made Notre Dame’s all-opponent team. They were

Hoopsters Oppose Lafayette;
Fresh Entertain Youngstown

Coach Hopes‘
Team Ready

by MIKE BROUBMAN

Most of the hope for the
immediate future of basket-
ball at the University tests
with the highly touted fresh-
man team. Tonight is the
night when the fans may ﬁnd

out whether the fresh are for
real, as they encounter their first

~ rough test of the season, with

the Youngstown JV’s.

In two of their four games this
year, the freshman basketball
team has been hampered by a
lack of practice. The result both
times was a closer game than

. most people had anticipated, with

the Cubs pulling both out in the
ﬁnal few minutes.

Tonight, still somewhat ' ham-
pered by a lack of timetogether,
the Cubs meet a team which has
no . such problems Youngstown,
which visits the Field House to-
night at 6:15, has already played-
ten games in the young season,

as compared to the Cubs total of _

four. If the fresh can win, they
will cast aside some of the doubts
raised by the closeness of their
last two games.

Fresh coach Tim Grgurich ree-
ognizes the problem this lack of
experience presents, as witnessed

by the close call last w_eek~with ‘

Westminster. “We just weren't
ready, either physically or men-
tally,” said Grgurich about the
58-57 victory.,“We had that long
layoﬁ, and the boys still don’t
know each other that well yet.”

It took the Cubs over half the -
game to get organized. “We play- _

ed .a really lousy ﬁrst half. But,
in‘ the second half we ,’really re-
bounded well. In that last min-
ute, with a one point lead, I
thought we really played great
defense.” a .. .

Grgurich believes that it will
take more than one goodhalf to
beat Youngstown. Last year, they
handed the frosh their ﬁrst de-
feat, and they have‘ the material
to repeat. For the ﬁrst time this
year, the Cubs will be smaller
than their opponents.

Youngstown’s leading scorer is
Andy Gromley, a. 5’11” guard,
but along with him they have a
6'9” center in Will Teague and a

Face Syracuse Away Saturday

PETE SMITH
Provides the spark.
~.6'6” forward in Wayne Davis,
To . counter this height, Grgu-
rich is expecting a big effort from ‘

his 6’7” center Charlie Hunt.
“Charlie did real well against
Westminster. He’s improving
every game point-wise, rebound-
ing, and on defense. But, he has
to improve a lot because he has
to play an awful lotﬂof basket-
ball for us next year.” Against
the Little Titans, Hunt scored 15
points. ,

Another top rebounder for the
Cubs is Mike Patcher. Playing

despite a bad back, Patcher, ac-.

cording to Grgurich, “Did a great

. job on the boards in the second

half. "We had 46 rebounds, and all
but 12 were in the second half.”
Of interest locally is the fact
that Youngstown was defeated at
home by the Duquesne frosh, 93-
86. If the Cubs can do likewise,
it will run their record to 5-0.

New Coach Jerry Snyder Expects

Solid Nucleus for SwimmingTeam.

by JAY KAPLAN
The swimming team will try to
live up to the potential that
coach Jerry Snyder says it has
when they meet the Orangemen
at Syracuse on. Saturday.

The swimming team's ﬁrst meet
for 1967 will be an important one
for its new coach. “Potentially
this team could break all the
school's records,” Snyder said at
the beginning of‘ the season. It
will be in this meet that Snyder’s
reasons for optimism will be
tested.

The team has a solid nucleus
in returnees John Lane, Joe Le-
Viere, and Gary Martin. Both‘
Lane and LeViere are juniors
while Martin is a senior. To-
gether, they teamed up for ove

_ A ,_ p 22 ﬁrst place ﬁnishes. ‘ _ ' .
‘and he managed a 1-1 draw __ ' ' ‘ ”

freestyle and seven ﬁrsts in the
500 yard freestyle. He was voted
Most Valuable Swimmer of 1966
and ﬁnished eighth in the 1,650
yard freestyle at the Easterns.
Baring injury, he should he even
better this year_

LeViere swims in the 200 yard
backstroke event and in the med-
ley relay. He earned seven ﬁrsts‘
and two seconds last year in this
event. LeViere is a prime ex--
ample of this year’s strong, young
squad. -

Gary Martin, the senior of the
trio, is the team co-captain this
year along with butterﬂier Dick
I-Iulme. Martin swims all strokes
well but will concentrate on the
50 and 100_yard freestyle sprints
this year.

There are only ﬁve seniors en

en are’  andj '

der, are the Norris’ twins, How-
ard and Richard, from Yardly,
Pa.‘

Howard will swim the butter-
fly and the distances, while Richie
will be in the individual medley
and freestyle. The Norris twins
are but two of the promising
crop of sophomores that should
bolster this year’s squad.

The diving will be handled’

mostly by two juniors, Dean Cole-
man and Rodny Chambers, des-
pite inexperience. Taking over
the job that Eastern runnerup
Don Hahnfeldt left vacant through
graduation is a difficult task but
Chambers and Coleman should

Clubs Evenly
,Matched in
Tilt Tonight

by JAY ROSENSTEIN
Assistant Sports Editor
It will be a battle between
two losing but eager ball-
clubs when Lafayette faces
‘the Panther basketball team
tonight at 8:15 at the Field

House.

While the cagers sport a 2-8
record, Lafayette can... boast of
one win in seven games.

Both teams, however, have been
playing good ball recently. -The
Panthers have lost tight games

Lafayette dropped their last game
to Maine, 67-62, and were beaten
by Io'na, 65-58.

In fact, aside from their open-
ing game walloping by Princeton,
the Leopards haven't lost a con-

all season. Coach George David-
son‘ has put together a starting
ﬁve consisting of three sopho-
mores, one junior, and one sen-
ior_

Soph George Lefkowski and
senior Nick’Azzolina pair up in
the backcourt. Azzolina leads La-
fayette’s scoring attack, averag-
ing 15 points per game. He’s
shown a ﬁne eye from the floor
with 46 ﬁeld goals in 91 attempts.
Leftkowski has contributed 12
points a game.

Lafayette uses what is best
described as a three forward of-
fense or a 2-3. Coach Davidson
substitutes frequently, although
sometimes of necessity. For in-
stance, 6’5” Bob Clements has
drawn 30 personal fouls in sev-
en encounters. ‘

When Clements departs, La-
fayette relies on sophomore Bob
Cole at 6’5” or Bill Tweardy at
6’6” to replace their leading re-
bounder. Joe Stalevicz and Mike
Goetz also play up front with
Stalevicz having the dubious dis-
tinction . of attempting 21 foul
shots and making only six.

It's apparent that the Panthers
and Leopards have more in com-
mon than nicknames and season’s
records. The height 'mat.chup to-
night will be virtually identical.
The cagers’ Jim LaValley stands
6’6” and forwards Ken Bollens
and A1 DiFrischia both are 6’5”.
Even Sylvestor Stevenson, who
coach Bob Timmons is cautiously

same at 6’2” as Stalevicz_

Len Kalata, playing guard, is
averaging 14 points per game,
which is almost equal to Lafay-
ette’s Azzolina. And to cap the

clubs, both the Panthers and
Leopards have scored an average
of 64 points ‘each game and have
' allowed an average of 74, points
to opponents. P
Timmons has indicated that he
won’t necessarily keep the eagers
in a ball control offense. The
slowdown works well against
clubs that like to run and shoot,
but since that is not Lafayette’s
style, it’s probable that Timmons
will have his club pressing and
last-breaking once again.
Pacing the Panthers on the
court will be a revitalized Pete
Smith. The ex-Uniontown foot-

to Westminster and Syracuse. -

working into the lineup, is the

Shidemantle Stars in Gymnastics Meet

Lose To
U. of Mass.

by ANDY SWARTZ

The gymnastics team
doesn’t seem to realize when
it has something good going
for them. Tree’s Hall is con-
sidered among the ﬁnest
sports complexes in the nation,
yet these lucrative facilities are
rusting. For thus far this year
coach Warren Neiger’s gymnas-
tics squad has compiled a 1-3
record with tougher competition
yet to come.

Last Monday, the seven gym-
nasts went up against a strong
14 man squad from the Univer-
sity of Massachusetts and, al-
though compiling their best score
of the season, were defeated, 149-
142. There were about as many
spectators as there are ﬂoors in
the Cathedral, yet Neiger’s sev-
en men turned in a commendable
performance.

Dave Shidemantle is almost
back to last season’s form taking
a ﬁrst in the floor exercise event,
second on the trampoline, and
another ﬁrst in the long horse
event. He also received the high-
est single event score in the
meet with his 9.35 on the long
horse.

Coach Neiger was not disap-
pointed in the boys performances
as it was their best of the sea-
son but with competitors like
Penn State yet to come he can
only hope for a small miracle for
a winning record.

Jim Sacco won the all-around
event Monday, extending his rec-
ord to 4-0 for the season. Sacco
also placed second in the still
rings, side horse, and parallel
bars. Ig Perez ﬁnished third on
the rings and on the ﬂoor exer-
cises.

The gymnasts won only two
overall events, the long horse and
the ﬂoor exercises_ In both cases
Shidemantle took a ﬁrst. The
gymnasts were actually outrnan-
ned on their home court as Mass-
achusetts had 17 representatives
compared to their seven.

On Jan. 7, the gymnastic squad
traveled to Springﬁeld, Mass.,
where they were trounced, 174-
132. Shidemantle turned in an-
other ﬁne -performance, ﬁnishing
second in the long horse and
third in the ﬂoor exercise. Spring-
ﬁeld College is rated one of the
top two teams in the East and 17
participants entirely outclassed
the gymnastics squad.

Coach Neiger sees a dim sea-
son ahead, but with the aid of
additional scholarships hopes in
the future to return to the win-
ning forrn of the late ﬁfties when
his teams compiled 7-2 records.

Conditioning
Program
Again Set

The University’s Athletic De-
partment will again sponsor a
physical conditioning program
which is open to all students and
faculty members, beginning Jan.
23.

Assistant football coach Jim
Royer will be in charge of the
program which includes three 45
minute periods weekly on Mon-
day, Tuesday, and Thursday. A
participant must choose at least
one session each week.

In each period, there will be
quickness and agility drills,
weight lifting, wrestling, running
and other physical exercises.
Handball also is included.
