IFC Smoker Begins  
Interfraternity Rush
Tonight In Ballroom

Formal fraternity rush will begin today at 8 p.m. with
a smoker sponsored by the Inter-Fraternity Council (IFC).
Men interested in attending will meet in the SU Supper
Room to register for rush. A rush fee of $2 will be charged.

Formal rush will continue two weeks, ending at 2 a.m.
on Oct. 2. A period of Open Rush will extend for a week
after this date. Ed Stack, IFC’s central rush chairman,

noted that this period is for rush-
ees having an especially difficult
time deciding which fraternity
they would like to join.

(See ed'ito’rial—
‘fMeet The Greelcs”——page four.)

Rush rules for the fall term

’ are as follows:

All full-time students ‘enrolled
in a program of studies leading
to a degree and who are not on
academic probation are eligible

Rushees must be prepared to
identify themselves as bona ﬁde
students of the University at any
rush party or function.

Formal rush begins with the

’IFC smoker today and ends at

tance on Oct. 3. Prior to the be-
ginning of Formal Rush, no po-
tential rushees may attend fra-
ternity functions or enter fra-
ternity premises.

All rushees must be registered
in order to rush and receive bids.
Registration opens at the smoker
and continues at the Office of
the Dean of Men until 5 p.m.
seprc.’z9.

A rushee obtains his rush num-
ber when he registers. He cannot
receive bids without his number.

Before and during Formal Rush,
the use or presence of alcoholic

. beverages is strictly prohibited
3’ in any relationship between fra-

ternities or fraternity men and
rushees.

A quiet period (no contact be-
tween fraternity men and rush-
ees) will begin at 1:30 a.m. on
Oct. 2 at the end of the last for-
mal rush party, and extend to 5

p.m. on Oct 3, at the close of bid’

acceptance.

3 and ends at 5 p.m. Oct. 11.
' During Open Rush, any man
can pledge himself to "any fra-
ternity at any time provided that
the fraternity registers the bid at

Mahmood  Mamdani Starts

Pitt Progressive Union

By DAN BOOKER

The constitution and by-
laws of a new student or-
ganization, designed to pro-
mote discussion and action
on important student issues,
have been submitted to the
‘University Recognitions

. Committee. Mahmood Mam-

dani, a O senior political sci-
ence major and a leader of the
new group, explained that its
purpose is to act as both a forum
on student issues and a pressure
group. '-

Most of the membership of the
Progressive Union, as it will be
called, comes from the Pitt Pro-
gressive Party (PPP), although
additional students have shown
interest. The PPP is a political

party which has run a slate of

candidates in the last two Stu-
dent Government elections. But,_
says Mamdani, this sphere was

too restricted to allow discussion ~

in all areas of student concern-—
social and religious concerns, as
well as political ones.

International Students
Program This Year
Initiate Brother-Sister

By BERNI MeLEOD

To prevent foreign students
from feeling like strangers
at the University, the Inter-
national Student Organiza-
tion’s Brother-Sister Pro-
gram is underway this year,
helping foreigners and‘Amer-
icans get acquainted. _

Under the Brother-Sis-ter Pro-
gram, a foreign student-is match-
ed with an American “brother”
or “sister” who is known-to have
similar interests. He often meets
many more people through his
new “friend,” and starts to feel
more a part of college life.

According to Lois Brady, co-
president of the International
Student Organization, the pro-
gram has been rapidly growing
in popularity with American stu-
dents at the University. “So many
students go abroad for study or
summer trips,” said Miss Brady,
“that they know what is like to
feel like a ‘foreigner.’ It’s an ugly
situation. When you have gone
through it yourself, you are more
sympathetic to helping others
feel at home.”

The Brother-Sister Program is
only one activity of the Inter-
national Student Organization,
which prides itself on being truly
Each office, or
chairman in the group is ﬁlled by
two people, one American and
one foreign student. In this way,
both groups are well represented

noted the policy covering dissem-

dorms. Although promises to the
contrary have been made, some
of the restrictions placed on the
distribution of literature have not
been revoked since their initial
establishment last year. Mam-
dani hopes that the Progressive
Union will be able to make the
change.

Such subjects as drafting of
special regulations to accommo-

BULLETIN;

The former Chancellor’s resi-
dence on Morewood Heights has
been sold to the Catholic Insti-
tute of Pittsburgh. The Pitt News
had previously reported in Mon-
day’s issue that an announce-
ment of the sale would be offi-
cially made this week.

x\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

The sale was made possible

through ﬁnancial aid from the '

Hillrnan Foundation. The mani-

son will be used as a resident '

house of studies by religious sis-
ters of both the Catholic and
Protestant faiths. The women
will maintain the cloistered reli-

gious pattern of their lives while

doing special work at campuses
and research centers in the Pitts-
burgh 

Official University spokesmen
estimated that the University
would receive about $180,000 for
the sale of the residence. The
Catholic Institute received the
residence complete with rugs and
drapes.

Catholic Bishop John J‘. Wright
said that the Diocese would not
seek real estate tax exemption on
the house. He hoped that tax au-
thorities would take into consi-
deration the religious and" educa-
tional uses of parts of the prop-
erty under a formula similar to
that previously worked out in
partial favor of the University.

- I The title, Mind and Cosmos, re-
3 ﬂeets the organization of the book
;_into two large sections. The arti-
 cles, however, cut across the cog-
‘ nitive-logical and cosmic realms.
Many of the articles concern con-
tinuing debates in the philosophy
501" science (especially those by
g{‘ Shapere, Bromberger, Hempel and
Salmon), and provide indispen-
sable background material for
 people deeply committed to the
philosophy of science.

contributions by Herbert A. Si-

\Mind and Cosmos Introduced

prospective readers should con-
sult the relevant material by C.
G. Hempel and A. Grunbaum. It
provides the counter-arguments
to Bromberger’s critique of the
deductive-nomological and statis-
tical models of .s°cientiﬁc explana-
tion. A

The largest single article con-
tained in Mind and Cosmos is
Wesley Salmon’s treatise on in-
ductive inference and probabil-
ity. Salmon begins with Hume’s
skeptical conclusions regarding
the possible justiﬁcation of in-
duction. This area of research is
Salmon’s specialty, and his pre-
sentation of the Humian dilemna,
as well as alleged solutions is
exceptionally lucid. As Dr. Col-
odny’s introduction states, Pro-
fessor Salmon uncovers new re-
lationships between the issue of
the justiﬁcation of induction and
interpretations of probability.

{Pitt — Private??

_ PITT IS extinct. Its image
‘I as a private institution of
academic learning has disap-
fipe-ared. It has been replaced.
by aninstitution named the
* University of Pittsburgh,
Commonwealth Systems in
‘ Higher Education. The new
‘institution bears an image of
]a public institution similar to
"5 its Eastern sister the Penn-
sylvania State University.

, There has recently devel-
zgoped a cult which asserts
-_' that the public image is
5, wrong and “Pitt is still pre-
I dominately private.” The cult
insists that Pitt still exists
 because it was alway state-
vrelated and now there mere-
._ly has been an increase in
,the amount of state-related-
iness. -

 The ‘cult further claims
-that the largest portion of
the state appropriation cov-
, ers tuition and that private
:funds are needed to offset
Y other costs. They insist ‘.‘th~e

,'"ably easier for the -private
g-donor.” Members of the cult
" conclude that the crucial dis-
tinction between “state - re-
,1-§l'ated” and being a “state
university” remains the key
0 Pitt’s life.

; CULTIST CLAIMS distort
*.=reality. They give a skewed,

- state has made it consider-‘

‘ shallow analysis of the sit-.

__ Tonight at 8 p.m. the freshmen and transfer men have the unique
opportunity of learning about the University fraternity system -and meet-
ing some of its members. To these men who have this chance, we say meet
the Greeks at the Smoker.tonight and participate in the fraternity rush.
"C On a campus where many clubs are nothing more than paper activ-
ities, the men's fraternities_stands out as a ‘strong and cohesive system.
"Within them men can ﬁnd the campus’ most varied and imaginative social
programs and the best organized intramural athletics.
Greek social life and sports are inevitably more enjoyable because
you share these experiences with men you have chosen to be with. You
are not a. part‘ of a group which. was artiﬁcially cre

University fraternities have grown in. number and membership in"
recent years. In 1963, there were 13 fraternities on this campus, nowthere
“.31'€ 15. In 1963, the over-all Greek membership was 479; in 1966, it is 820.
?Obviously the system’s future is bright and it will continue to be an in-
 tegral part of student life for many years to come;
i Much of the fraternity systems strength comes from the powerful

uation. While most of the
state appropriation has gone
for tuition, the legislation in-
corporating Pitt into the
state system entitles it to
considerable privileges. The
new institution now has easi-
er access to property acquisi-
tion and easier entree to
funds from the General State
Authority.

The new institution must
now be partial to Pennsyl-

vania residents both in ad-‘

missions policies and tuition
fees. Such features do not
characterize a “predominate-
ly private institution.’.’ The
public versus private sup-
port question has also been
oversimpliﬁed. The decline of
private support was one of
the crucial factors in Pitt’s
death. Local philanthropists’
unwillingness to aid the dy-
ing institution became their
signature of approval on the
incorporation proposal.

A distinction between be-

ing a “state-related” and be- A

ing a “state university” has
little utility. Private donors
view‘ the increased state-re-
latedness as being synono-
mous with being a state uni-
versity. Laymen cannot» be
convinced of the distinction
because the death of Pitt has
been reported consistently as
the endeavor to establish a
low-cost university for the

ated by a room assign-

  aa:tor:a:= Meet The Greeks 

and effective Interfraternity Council. Each fraternity sends a delegation O
to the twice monthly meetings. The ﬁrst group in recent years to estab-
lish a judicial branch, the IFC judiciary consists of ﬁve Greeks who have
sole right of discipline over the fraternity groups. Likewise, the IFC votes
on its own rush rules and other laws of operation.

The Greek system also incorporates the subtle, intangible values that
have been a part of American fraternity life since its inception over 150

 

years ago. These values can take the form of supportive brotherhood

where an upperclassmen counsels a young man during his period of ad-
justments to collegiate life. It can be the instillment of pride in the Uni-
versity or simply learning to work with people in the operation of a
complex organization.
In summarizing the importance’ of the fraternities on the University
campus, Acting Chancellor Dr. David Kurtzman put it best. Dr. Kurtz-
man said, “My impression has always been that fraternities are the leaders ‘
on the campus. Through competition, a greater sense of leadership devel-

ops. We would lose something if we did not have these groups for

leadership.”

      The Cult of Distortion

by Bill‘ Cabin

people of Western Pennsyl-

. Vania. ‘

WHETHER THESE per-
ceptions are correct or in-
correct is not the crucial
question. What is crucial is
that they exist and cannot
be changed by the ﬁne-line
distinctions of the cultists.
Neither a public relations
campaign nor a rational ar-
gument can alter the percep-
tions of either the private or
public sectors. For although
this institution and Penn
State receive both private
and public support, both are
viewed as state schools.

If the cultists persist in '

devoting their energies to
distort reality, they will face
the futility of trying to de-
ceive the private and public
sectors. Instead of asserting
that Pitt is still alive, the

. cultists should assert and

demonstrate the possible
beneﬁts of the new. institu-
tion.

The probable increase in
facility, the planned expan-
sion of facilities, the increas-
ed numbers being educated,
and the ‘quantitative growth
of the Pittsburgh cultural
community should be stress-
ed. Such image building will
not only be more strategical-
ly sound and realistic, but
also elicit a more favorable
responseifrom both the pri-
vate and public sector.

C Time For A Change
  Plea For Constitution

(Editor’s Note: Mr. Hyman is
Clzairman of the SG Consti-
tutional Committee.)

THIS ARTICLE is an ar-

gumentfor the adoption of a V

new Student Government
(SG) Constitution, yet be-

fore even discussing the pro- .

posed Constitution, certain

   
  

student body.
Secondly, one
‘ must show

HYMAN that SG at
Pitt has failed and, there-

I fore, must be changed. Last-

ly, one must give deﬁnite
-reasons for SG’s failure and
show that the proposed Con-
stitution can eliminate these
reasons. If the reader ac-
cepts the justiﬁcation of
these principles then he must
vote, and he must vote for
adoption. -

SG is necessary to a vital
student body. As the only
representative of all Univer-
sity students, SG is themost
efficient and the most effec-
tive method of conveying
student opinion to the Ad-
ministration. The more di-
rectly and accurately the Ad-
ministration communicates

‘with. those it seeks to ad-

minister, the more wisely it
will act. SG is the link to the
Administration.

A second rationale for the
existance of a SG is the idea

that students should make-

the decisions in areas that
pertain only to students. As
the only body representing
all students, the SG is the
body that can make such de-
cisions fairly. As long as a
decision deals only with stu-
dents, who" has a better right
t-o make the decision than the
students themselves? Only
an active, strong SG can
make a slogan “Student con-
trol over student affairs” a
reality. When the student
body ﬁnally passes the adol-
escence stage of letting
others guide their actions,
SG becomes indispensible.

is obvious, yet it must be

explained, because up to ._now
SG at the University has
been unimaginative, ineffi-
cient, and downright ineffec-
tual. In short, a failure. Let’
me say right now that this
accusion is not an indictment
of those individuals who are
involved in SG, for these peo-
ple have labo-red under heavy
burdens to make SG work,
but rather stems from other
sources.

First, I wish to illustrate.
the failure of SG to be nec-
essary on this campus. SG
did not provide a link be-
tween students and the Ad-
ministration during the cru-

cial period when the Univer- '

sity was charting a course

toward state-relatedness. No ‘

issue had a greater effect
upon the student body, but
the poll taken by SG was
started and ﬁnished too late
to have any inﬂuence -on the
course that was chosen. SG
movements during the whole
affiliation issue were not
those. of a group inﬂuencing

a decision, but those of a‘

counter—puncher; reﬂex re-
actions that took place, post
facto, after the fact.

SG did not dominate Stu-
dent Affairs. Instances in

which the Administration ‘

felt it necessary to impose it-
self in decisions that apply
entirely to students are num-
erous. An example of this

was the formation of the"
Towers-Quadrangle Commit .

tee to deal with the distribu-
tion of literature in the dor-

mitories. As only represen- ‘

tative of all the students, it
should have been SG, not an
administrative committee
that arbitrated this student
dispute.

The outstanding example
of the weakness of SG was
the unwanted intervention
of the Administration in the
decision of how to distribute
allocations from the Student
Activities Fee. SG was not
able to stop this intervention

into the student domain. SG ‘

was not allowed to,Ina,ke its
own decision. Thus SG was a
failure.

Having explained why SG
is necessary and illustrating

,its failure on this campus, I

will explain the reason for
this falure and how the new
constitgution. will , remedy.

  Bemis ‘Pleads, Persuades
L. Boys In-to Playing Soccer
W 1 L L C By Tom Sacks

 U H Sports Editor

" ‘ ‘Nobody knows just how, but somehow he does it. With
falm—os't nothing to work with except persuasion, Leo Bemis
S has m-anaged to ﬁeld some of the ﬁnest soccer teams in the
"East during past years.
 Bemis declares himself ‘to be a self-made coach and the
’ tactics that he uses to get boysto play are even more self-
l-7_ma?de. Once a year he surveys the records of the incoming
"freshmen class. Whenever he ﬁnds a boy who has expressed
an interest in soccer, he literally signs him up,

“I keep up a correspondence with themduring the sum-
mer,” says Bemis. “That way they feel they’re part of the
freshman team before they even get here.”
' What it boils down to is. an old fashion sales talk with
. the boy buying and not receiving‘. Bemis must sell thelsport
1 ‘ itself for the ﬁnancial inducements he has to work with are
 far from overwhelming.

 

-. . g _ He is given two full scholarships a year. These are split '
3 into halves with two usually going to freshmen and two to _

varsity players.who have merited them.

Typical of thecomposition of Bemis’ teams are two boys
:  from Africa—Ernest Mouen from Cameroon and Sheldon
 7  Zuma from~Rhodesia—’who came out for this year’s squad.

3%   With Mouen, Bemis’ convincing powers were taxed to
Fftheir limit. Mouen’s ﬁnancial obligation are being split by
_ the University and his "home government. His government
1 sent him here to enter the School of Enginering and the
. . pressure on him to do well must be high. '
v __ With that type of pressure, time for sports doesn’t seem

a plausible, but Bemis talked and Mouen listened. He started

V in the Frostburg game last week. 7

 '_Even more typcial of Bemis’ recruiting program is the
' Lou Cepanec story. Prior to last year Cepanec had never
a‘ played in a soccer game. Then last year he joined the team
as goalie, setting a Pitt record by limiting opponents to
0.55 goals per game. ‘

  
     
     
   

 

As Bemis explains, “I found him because he was an ac-

;--tive participant in‘ the intramural programs. I asked him to
-. come out and he took the bait.”

V. -‘< Bemis himself reﬂects the makeup of the crew which
. he guides. Having played football in college and not soccer,
'3. his ﬁrstacquaintance with the sport was in the service.
“At that time I knew the "ball was round. Since then
, I've tried to be a student’ of the game. When‘ I came here in
_ _ the ’40s we started a club and in 1953 we were promoted to
«’-5‘ ' '_ the major sport level.”
L With Bemis providing the basic guidelines, his teams
have had a fair amount of success. Last year the booters
L received a bid to the NCAA playoffs. This year with Art

 " Richardson as the leader they look even stronger. Just how
..strong will be determined this Saturday when they meet

couldn’t stick to a lineup
which allowed 57 points and ex-

After the UCLA game, Hart
realized sophomore ' Art Alois
was “too green and not quick
enough to play left linebacker”
and he inserted Alois’ name at
left end“ The original left end,
Greg Keller, was found to be “a-
better inside man.” Keller re-
placed soph Greg Ellis at right
tackle.

In the empty linebacker posi-
tion, Hart plans to- go‘ with a
previous cornerman, Lou Parrott.
“With Tippy Pohl returning to

and one fumble, Hart made only
two offensive changes in the line.

were terrible, defensively,” he
said, “but today after making

Last" Saturday’s test enabled
Hart to re-evaluate his forces, but
for UCLA coach Tommy ‘Prothro,
the game was not very educa-
tional. “We didn’t learnltoo much

game.

-- When a team trails 50-7 in the ﬁnal quarter
V ;of a football game, a scoring p-lay serves only to

‘please parents and friends of the individuals in-
~ volved. . »

‘ To a fan it’s like seeing a one-yard plunge over
_ guard. on the isolated camera. It’s kind of insigni-
  ﬁcant.
' But football players have an axiom they fol-
’ low regardless of the score. “Never give up until

the game is over.” _
 I 'l.‘hat’s the way Bob Longo felt when he caught
_ A a Mike Elliot bomb for a 58-yard touchdown. “It
  felt strange in a way too,” Longo said. “I was
, » happy to score, but we had such a. long way to go.”
i They were seven points closer at 50-14. L
 The scoring strike from Elliot was one of 11
;L7 passes Longo grabbed during the UCLA debacle.
Eleven passes good for 155 yards and the touch-
-_ down. He broke Jim Maloney’s mark of ten catch-
 set in 1943. ,
  “Big deal, a. record,” said Longo. “We lost by
‘ 43 points.”
 The UCLA halfbacks played the Panther split
 end to the inside for most of the game. This gave
’ ‘Longo the outside and ‘the sideline patterns. “We
ran what we call quick outs,’,’, he said. “They’re
just taking a ‘few steps upﬁeld  then‘_cfutting \»

my side.”

   

 
   
   

l.Longo Broke a Panther Receiving Mark
 But the Game,‘ Not the Record, Counted

“Eventually, the halfback came up to try to
stop those plays and that’s when I went by him
for the touchdown.” Occasionally, the Bruin de-
fense would help out the halfback by putting a
linebacker on Longo to block off the short pass.
But it didn't seem to affect either Longo’s pat-
terns or quarterback Eddie James’ throwing.

UCLA never tried double coverage on Longo.
Since Duke scouts were in the Coliseum, it’s not
improbable that Duke head coach Tom Harp will
try to rig some sort of defense to try to stop him.

“If Duke tries anything special on me,” Longo
said, “it can only help" us. Skip (Orzulak) could
go crazy and the same with Mickey (Rosborough).
Both can take advantage of double coverage on

Longo seemed to feel that the trouble with
the Panthers last Saturday was that they would
run four or ﬁve good plays and then run one bad
one to botch up a drive. “Don’t forget, we gave
the ball up three times and that didn't make the
defense’s job any easier.”

. Two interceptions and a fumble marred James’
debut but he still completed 15 or 22 passes. “We
showed we coufd move the ball,” Longo said.
“We’l1 come" back, ‘we have to come back. I

afterwards,” said Hart. “I told
him not to apologize to us, but
to 75 points if he could.”

In practice this week, Hart

  

plans a stiff workout for the dc? 
fense. He still can see the likes '
of Mel Farr, Gary Beban, and" V
Rick Purdy, who rushed for 86,

82, and 80 yards, respectively.

 Frosh Boot

Frostburg
].V.’s, 5-2

With only a week’s practice,
frosh soccer coach George Som-
mer expected his charges to be
ragged, and they were. But, only
for the ﬁrst few minutesof their
opener with-Frostburg.

Once the freshmen got rolling,
they left Frostburg in the dust,
scoring an easy 5-2 victory. Their
conditioning and adaptability to
a new style of play was surpris-
ing to Sommer, an All-America
soccer player here last year.

“We had only a week to get in
shape,” he said, “so I had to
drill them like the varsity. They
are just young boys, and aren't
used to that type of punishment.
I was really surprised the way
they held up.”

Frostburg was surprised also.
After they had scored to take a
1-0 lead, their coach was heard
exclaiming, “They aren’t ready.
We’re going to beat them.” As
things turned, this was his last
chance to be enthusiastic during
the game. .

Moments later, the booters knot-

ted the score on a goal by Bob
Trexler, who Went on to score

_ three more. I
. Early in the third period Bob "

Quinlin converted a penalty kick
to give the frosh the lead. This
goal seemed to settle them down,
and the brand of play steadily
improved.

Their early raggedness was not
surprising to Sommer, but their
later. play was. Obviously delight-
ed with the success, he com-
mented, “I’ll be disappointed if
-we don’t go undefeated.”

edged Delta Sigma Phi, 5-4, and
Sigma Alpha Mu squeezed out a
9-8 victory over Delta Tau Delta
in eight innings.

In their ﬁrst game of the year,
Phi Ep appeared to have lost
none of their former power des-
pite the loss of such standouts
as George Prussin and Rick Ro-
govv through graduation. Manny
Golnick pitched and had a ﬂaw-
less ﬁeld to back him up.

Phi Ep hitting, led by Stan
Lederman, overwhelmed the Sig
Chi’s. Ledwerman had three hits

for the afternoon, including a. "

two run homer. »Mike Amowski
also had a two run homer in the
winners’ 19 hit attack.

The Sammies blew a ﬁve run
lead and needed an extra inning‘
to beat the Delts. Strong hitting
by Hank Gruner, Roger Kleid,
Mike Feldman and‘ a. two run
homer by third baseman John
Unger gave the Sammies a 7-2
lead going into the sixth 

John Peterson's home run with
