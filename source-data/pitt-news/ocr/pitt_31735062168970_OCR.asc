TO THE STUDENTS OF
THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH:

During the past year, and over the summer.
many members of the University faculty and staff
have been meeting together in an attempt- to de-
lineate some of the forces shaping the future of
the University.

_ As we did so, it became apparent to me, how-
ever, that students still are under-represented-in the

University’s decision-making process, and that"

many questions facing us could be better answered
with a continuing input of student opinion and ad-
vice. The University is in one sense a community,
and no community can function effectively that
does not provide an opportunity for its principal
elements to participate in reaching the decisions
that affect the life of the community—-all the more
so during this period of significant social change.

Therefore, it is my intention to take several ac-

tions for involving students more directly in the

policy-making of the University.

See Editorial l '-Page 4

To begin with, I am asking each dean to
strengthen the role and expand the use of the un-
dergraduate student cabinet in his school and to es-
tablish a graduate student cabinet if it does not
exist. These groups will give advice to the deans
on curriculum and instructional matters, which I
believe are the most vital of the concerns to which-
_student can address’ themselves. For example, the
Arts and Sciences Cabinet has promoted the use of
the pass-fail option and student end-of-course eval-
uations, and is now studying the utility of the for-

eign language requirement; moreof this kind of

constructive effort is needed. Also, I shall urge de-
partment chairmen, as well as deans, to seek more
student opinion and to devise other means of in-
volving students in academic policy issues. While
it is a basic principle that final authority in all
scholarly affairs must be ‘vested in the faculties of
departments and schools, I believe that student
opinion can be immensely helpful to the professor,
to stimulate him, as our own Professor Adolf Grun-
baum says, to “rethink his subject afresh and re-
mind him that the search for truth—andnot he-is
the arbiter in the classroom.”

 

THE UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

' /'

    
 

Chancellor Wesley Posvar

In the area of the Provost. the chief academic’
officer of the University, I am preparing the estab-

lishment of an Undergraduate Academic Council,

composed of representatives chosen by the student
cabinets in each of the undergraduate schools. to
meet regularly under the chairmanship of an'As-
sistant Provost to review academic matters of broad-
er scope. I am also recommending the creation of

. a similar council at the graduate level.

Further, I shall establish, with concurrence of
the Student Government and the University Fac-
ulty Senate. an All—University Council, composed
of representativesof undergraduate and graduate
students. faculty and administration. My present
thought is that this body might be chaired by the
Provost, with a student as vice-chairman.

The All-University Council would meet at least
monthly, set its own procedures, and report its
findings and recommendations to the Chancellor.
As the occasion indicates, the Chancellor, the Pres-
ident of the Faculy Senate, and representatives of
the Trustees could be invited to its meetings. The
Council would consider matters referred to it by
the Chancellor, the University Senate, Student
Government, or the Trustees, as well as any other
issues that might be identified by any member of
the Council. However, it is my hope to inivite the.
Council to study in depth and report on certain po-
licy issues that. affect the University at large. These .
might include: '

—'A penetrating examination of the nature" and
purpose of the systems of grades and credits;

—-A search for ways to exploit new teaching
methodologies and automation; .

' — A review of the academic calendar;

—A consideration of methods for determining I

rules of student conduct, and

Wednesday, September I l, 1968

—— An evaluation of our concepts of design for
future building construction on our five campuses.

or ‘Reorganization’

Now I must stress that these proposals are meant ’

to augment and in no way to infringe on or to dim-
inish the importance of our existing institutions for
building consensus and formulating and reviewing

- policy: The University Faculty Senate, the Council

of the Senate, Student Government, the Board of
Trustees. and our various administrative and stu-
dent affairs staffs.‘ Besides these, we have estab-
lished during the past year important new agen-
cies, including the -office of the Provost itself, the
integrated Faculty of Arts and Sciences, an ex-
panded office of planning, and directorates of ex-

perimental educational programs and community ‘

service programs.

All of these are active and essential organs of
our University. I am aware, however, that their
roles are not well enough publicized and under-
stood; therefore, I intend in the near future to
clarify to students the functions of these and to pro-

mote more direct contact of their members with ‘

students.

Along with these proposals, I wish to add a note
of caution. This is a complex institution, made up
of many components such as schools and centers
with widely different missions; it is an institution
governed through an intricate set of democratic pro-
cedures, based in dialogue, dependent on communi-
cation. I seek here only to improve the University

' by strengthening the voice of the student. We must

all avoid false or naive expectations: there is no
simple panacea or organizational gimmick that in
itself can make university administration very much
easier, any less tedious and mundane in its details,
or radically more effective in dealing with the ma-
jor issues that face this nation. We may hope to
move responsibly closer to these issues, and that
may be an unsettlingand revealing experience, but
we should realistically expect to find that good in-
tentions are not the same as easy solutions.

Nonetheless, I am proposing what many people
would consider to be drastic inovations in univer-
sity governance. Drastic or not, I think they are
sorely needed. These innovations are experimental,
and I expect that we shall want to alter and improve
them as the year progresses, and to consider other
means of enlarging the role of the student in Univer-
sity affairs. It is my hope that you, as students, will
take most seriously my desire for the University to
benefit from your views "on matters that go beyond
the social life of the campus, matters that embrace
the fundamental values of the educational process.

Wesley W. Posvar,
Chancellor

 
 

Arts Committee Concert

 program}?

Carnegie Music Hall in Oakland will be the site
of-a concert presented by the Modern Jazz Quartet
Friday at 8 p.m. Free tickets for this concert spon-
sored by the Committee of the Arts are available
with the presentation of a student ID c_ard at the
Student Union Information Center.

This musical team of John Lewis..piano; Milt
Jackson. vibroharp; Percy Heath, bass; and Connie
Kay. percussion. present the type of improvisation
that can be found in few other modern groups.
Pianist Lewis. who is also the musical director. be-
lieves that “the audience for jazz can be widened
if we strengthen our work with structure.”

The scores for Roger Vadim’s No Sun in Venice
and the American picture Odds Against Tomorrow
are proof of Lewis’ unusual talents in the jazz field.

The Modern Jazz Quartet has eliminated dis-
traction from the jazz concert stage in order to pre-
sent their music. Though dull-looking'(prompting
British critics to term one of their performances
“jazz in sober suits”) the Quartet’s stage attitude
compels the audience to listen.

One critic summarized these tremendous per-
formers when he said. “The unity of the group dis-
qualifies individual showmanship and superficial
characterization by any of the players which might
intrude .on the real business at hand, the musical

Chancellor Posvar participates in
Hillman dedication.

Present Curfew Systemi

The University’s Hillman Li-
brary was dedicated Monday. The
building was formally presented
to the University by the state and
the Hillman family.

A reception was held between
4 and 7 pm. for several thousand
guests, including Mr. Henry Hill-
man, ‘representing the Hillman
Foundation and the Hillman Fam-
ily; Lieutenant-Governor Ray-
mond J. Broderick, representing
the Commonwealth and the Gen-
eral State Authority; Dr. Samuel
B. Gould, chancellor of the State
University of New York; Mayor
Joseph M. Barr of Pittsburgh;
James Walton. president of Car-
negie Library and Carnegie In-
stitute of Pittsburgh; David Clift,
executive director of the Ameri-
can Library Association, and Mr.
William Rae, chairman of the Uni-

» versity’s Board of Trustees.

co-eds questioned.

Some of the girls felt that the
curfews should be abolished com-
pletely. “By the time you come to

nie Mish. “Women have been fight-
ing for years to gain equal rights
and they deserve them,” added
another freshmen, Karen Bradow.
Sue Levin, a mentor, felt that up-‘
perclassmen should have no cur-
few but that “freshmen need
them.” However, she said that
second-term freshmen should have
the same hours that upperclass-
men now have.

Some girsl felt that the present
curfew regulations are ridiculous
since they aren’t really obeyed.
“We aren’t restricted by the cur-
few,” snickered one sophomore
girl. “Girls just take overnights
and sign out for home.”

Some girls were a bit more con-
servative. “The curfews are okay,”
said Janice Kaminski. “They
should just get rid of the quarter
hours.” “Yes,” agreed another
girl, “I see no reason why any
girl would want to stay out all
night anyway.”

“I think that the curfews are

struction of Hillman Library, Dr.
Gould presented an address on
“The University Library in an
Urban Setting.” Broderick, Hill-
man and Rea participated in in-
formal dedication ceremonies, a-
long with Dr. C. Walter Stone,
director of Universities Libraries,
and University Chancellor Wesley
W. Posvar. '

The library came into being
largely through the donation of
more than $3,000,000 from the
Hillman family and the Hillman
Foundation, and through the aus-
pices of the General State Author-
ity which, upon approving the
plans, appripriated $8,235,000 for
construction purposes.

Hillman is divided into two
separate areas geared specifical-
ly to the needs of the undergradu-
ate and the graduate students.
The undergraduate library occu-
pies the first and second floors

watching us. We’re not ready to be
on our own.”

“All of the boys questioned felt
that the curfew, regulations should
be changed to some extent. “Yeah,”
sneered Ron Levenwski, “If a
girl wants to stay out, she should
be able to.” Charlie Reiff agreed,
“If a girl is old enough to go to
college, she can do wh_at she
wants.”

and the graduate research col-
lections are on the third and fourth
floors.

Most of the general reference
works are housed on the ground
floor. Here also is the Instruction-
al and Research services area of
audio—visual instructional mater-
ial. When connected with a pro-
posed information retrieval sys-
tem, this setup will enable stu-
dents and faculty to refer to the
materials they want and, from
their study carrels, dial the selec-
tion and view and or hear at their
desk the material they picked.

‘ Students Express Mixed Feelings

Psychology major Paul St. John
felt that girls over 18 should be
allowed out all night. He pointed
out the absence of such rules in
some Europen countries and some
progressive American universities.
Senior Jack Heinowitz felt. that
girls should have unlimited over-
nights. He proposed that each up-
perclasswomen be given the
choice of taking the 2:30 curfew or
just staying out all night.

Dorm Room Shortage  

Slights One

by BRUCE LEVENSON

The University Housing De-
partment has had its hands full
since’ the start of the term. Di-
rector of Housing David Ginevin
reported in an exclusive interview
that approximately seventy men
and fifty—five women were un-
able to secure dormitory space for
the present term. .

This unpleasant circumstance
was due to a higher return of up-
perclassmen to the dorms than
was anticipated. Re-applications,
generally number about seventy-
five per cent. This term, accord-
ing to Ginevin, in excess of eigh-
ty-five per cent of the upperclass-
rnen housed during spring term

had re-applied. The predicted a-
mount of freshmen seeking dormi-
tory space also registered. “The

overflow came from the upper-
classmen,” Ginevin summed up.

This term a fifty dollar applica-
tion fee was required for the first
time to cutback on applications.

Everyone whom we were obli-
gated to was housed,” Ginevin
asserted. Those students not hous-
ed in the dorms have been situa-
ted in every available room on
campus. Some freshmen have
movedin with dormitory residents
assistants. Resident assistants in
the past have lived alone. “We’re
not too happy about this” one of
them said, “but we realize the
necessity of the situation.” Some
men are residing in fraternity
houses that have rooms available.
The rest have rooms at the Web-
ster Hall Hotel. ~

“This is the first time we have
ever had a shortage of rooms,”
the Housing Director stated. “In
the past we have had excesses.
Two years we had two hundred
vacant rooms. This term, anyone
who applied just one day late was
rejected.” .

The biggest problem facing the 
student power movement is not 
the; administration, but the stu- "gt:
dents themselves. According to, 7;;
Student Government (SG) Pres-T 
ident Ken Schueler, “Students have. 
been conditioned by their par-, 
ents, grade school and high school  
to blindly obey authority and not C. *5
to make judgements for themsel-' 

ves. These same students remain

forever conditioned to meekly 
accept authority. Apathetic stu- 7

dents make-apathetic citizens.”
The student power movement

is based on an educational pre-‘_'““

mise; people learn by"cfoing, he

explained. A person can’t learn . T

to be involved in the World by

simply reading books. Students" ff
need a certain amount of rights. *

“Education,” syas Schueler, “real-

ly involves students learning to‘

help themselves. All we are ask-

ingfor is a chance to make our i

own mistakes and then to learn
from them.” '

“What happens to us here at C‘ C

the University affects us the rest
of our lives — and that is impor-

tant. The movement isn’t really . ‘ V

radical,” he stressed. >___ T
SG wants to change the basic

assumptions of the University — 9 ’

not just specific problems. It is
presently assumed that only the

faculty and the administration C A
have the right to make the rules. 

If this asumption was changed,

specific issues, such as women's -

curfews and course distribution,
would change also.

At the present time, the students 

can only make suggestions to the

ministration and hope that they _
will be acted upon. SG feels that ’

the students should have the pow-'

er to effect changes — especial- 
ly onissues which affect only the 

students.

Social regulations, for one ex-

ample, do not concern the admin-
istration at all. Schueler suggest-

ed that the administration be’_

given two weeks to make a de-
cision on any SG proposal. If it

is not acted upon, it is automa-
tically passed. If it is to be ve-
toed, it must be vetoed in front
of the entire Student Government.

By this method, the University
could be run democratically. No
one group, neither the student
body nor the administration,
would have complete control.

Schueler cited an example of A

the waste presently going on; This

summer, SG requested that the.

administration offer several inter-
disciplinary course. We found fac-
ulty members who were willing
to work on it. But the administra-

  A Victoryll

Throughout the summer months the University was faced
with a perplexing situation. That situation concerned the very
future of this institution. Change was in the air, but the trans-
ition to change was buried in a thick hazy cloud.

Reacting to this situation, The Pitt News published a
series of articles calling for change at the University. At that
time, we called for the formation of a University Council and
the creation of College Cabinets. At the same time, members
of the faculty and administration began a series of meetings
focused to the problem of restructuring the University to al-
low for more student participation in decision-making.

This two pronged effort of The Pitt News and the admin-
istration has finally come to fruition.

We are pleased to report that Chancellor Posvar has call-
ed for the creation of College Cabinets. The Chancellor has
also made provisions for the graduate student at the Univer-
sity——the forgotten man of the campus community. P

. Beyond this, Dr. Posvar is preparing the establishment
of an Undergraduate Academic Cabinet. This body will dis-
cuss matters of broad academic scope. As in the case of the
district College Cabinets, the Chancellor‘ has called for a
similar body to represent graduate students. And this, we
feel, is essential.

Another essential aspect of Dr. Posvar’s proposal, of
course, is the All-University Council. We agree that the Uni-
versity will be improved “by strengthening the voice of the
student. And the student voice will be strengthening by the
formation of such a body.

These structural formations were sorely needed, for
structural innovation is necessary if change is to be accom-
plished. Without these revised structures, the changes that
students are now asking for would be lost in the desert of
bureaucratic waste. '

Most importantly, the Chancellor has convinced us of his
keen awareness of student problems and desires. He is aware

. .. that students here are very much concerned with the follow-
. —ing issues: the nature and purpose of grades and credits;
new ways of exploiting teaching methodology; considerations-

of the rules of student conduct; an evaluation of our con-
cepts of design for the University’s future building programs.
In short, Dr. Posvar seems to be tuned in to the student’s de-
sire for more responsibility at the University. And we must
compliment him on his awareness.

Perhaps the administration is beginning to erase the puri-
tan comfort of the past? Maybe, they are beginning to dirty
their hands with the hardships of change?

But all students must realize that we now have an added
responsibility to fulfill. If we, as students, are going to fo-
ment change under these new structures advocated by Dr.
Posvar, we can no longer shirk off the responsibilities of par-
ticipating in University decision-making. If we are to foment

. change here, we must work-we must work hard.

_ Although Dr. Posvar’s proposal calls for only a few stu-
dents to sit on these new University bodies, let us not forget
._that all the students will, in a sense, be participating in Uni-
versity decision-making. In short, the students at this Univer-
sity have won a victory; we can now have a voice in deciding
our own destiny. V .

This victory, however, necessitates that genuine student
opinion be heard regularly. We therefore ask that all students
voice their gripes or complaints to The Pitt News—an innova-
tor of change at the University. Your opinions will be heard
and will lead all of us to many more student victories.

From The End Of The Bar

Don’t Wake From Dream;
It’s ]ust World Reality  

by GEORGE LIES
Associate Editor

The damaging dream damned man. I

The scene:

A cool, nine-at—night sky; no wind, and there
_ was nothing to rustle. .

The place: i
Pittsburgh’s Uptown section;
the corner was Fifth Avenue and
Stevenson Street.

' The action:

Hundreds of Negro blacks, one 

carrying a huge white flag stray-

ed down the street. They were at-

tacked. -

Caucasian whites struck them
from behind. The blacks turned,
about face, and charged.

It was a race riot. It was the damn of man.

Whites huddled scaredly behind closed doors
along the streets. They waited, mumbling and moo-
ing. The blacks would be back, after their first

fight forsurvival.

Then the scene switched. The slurnbering sub-
conscious turned the hatred and the battle into a
restaurant; red and white checkered cloths covered

the table.

 

And there, at one table, was Freddie Webb. a

Negro black. I was happy to see this high school
pal; it was a long time ago. .

“Freddie,.how are you.” I said in this dream.

. outside. ‘

LIES

Freddie didn’t smile.

He turned his head, looked to the side, and then
shook his head in disbelief. Without saying it, he
meant it was stupid and wrong to shake a white
with a black hand.

He walked away. And the scene switched again.

There it was, a beautiful house with beautiful
walls and beautiful furniture and beautiful whites.
Outside, the house was surrounded by blacks. They
sat in weeds, and garbage, but they were so far
from the beautiful house, that no white knew they
were there. Though the threat was there, lingering

One black walked to the window of the beauti-

ful house of the dream. He talked a different lan-
guage than that of the whites. No white understood
him. It was babble. '

It was then that the subconscious realized it was

dreaming. It wasn’t reality; the battle, the hatred,

dreams.

No, it would never really happen. It was better

How Our Readers See It .3 . I”

Here’s Language Argument, Again

Editor, The Pitt News:

The need to defend self-evident
truths seems to be a modern phe-
nomenon. I do not speak here of
the challenge of metaphysical
truths, prevalent in earlier cen-
turies as well, but of matters re-
lating ,;_, to time - honored institu-
tions and beliefs .and their_ un-
questioned validity.

During the summer months,
The Pitt News carried. recently
two articles bearing on the stu-
dy of languages, We shall not here
enter into the arguments which
were advanced against the study
of modern languages and the al-
ternative. solutions offered by the
student-authors in regard to the
problem as they see it. Whether
made in ignorance or with the
intention of bending the argu-
ment to suit the case, one state-
ment occurring in both articles
deserves comment. The sole pur-
pose of studying a modern lan-
guage, so it said, is to enable the
student to use the language when
abroad. Hence thelimited value
and questionable application of
such a study. _

Languages have been studied
sincethe dawn of history. Yet up
till our times little need was felt

-to justify the effort and utility

of learning them. When Cicero
in company with other young Ro-
mans applied himself to the stu-
dy of Greek, it was the cultural
superiority (however reluctantly
admitted) of another civilization
which imposed the need of stu-
dying the language. -

The American pioneer living in
isolation on an exposed frontier
no doubt sought communication
with his nearest neighbor, even if
he spoke a different language, as
he sought protection and compan-
ionship. Material needs, necessity,
and the desire for self-improve-
ment are therefore, important fac-
tors. Nor should one underesti-
mate the inherent benefits derived
from the discipline of grammar
and the increased awareness of
one’s own language. But there are
others. .

Young persons seeking positions
abroad or preferment at home,_
the numerous opportunities of-
fered to those possessing know-.
-ledge of another language, ‘ the:

such a knowledge — we cannot
name all the cases in which a

mastery of languages, in addition

to our own, has proven a "dedica-
ted advantage. Millions have la-
tely been wasted on research when
adequate knowledge of foreign
scientific publications would
have shown its needlessness since
the answer to the problem had al-
ready been discovered.

The present writer could name

more than one instance when the —

acquaintance with another lan-
guage not only proved useful dur-
ing the last war but in two in-
stances meant the difference be-
tween life and death. _ ‘

We have not yet,however,
named the strongest and most val-
id reason for the study of other
languages. Philosophers, human-
ists,_scientists, statesmen, nay the
overwhelming majority of man-
kind recognize the need for a clos-
er union‘ of nations and peoples
in a world where such an union
is not only a question of exped-
iency but of survival.

The study of history reveals man
kind, beyond temporary catacly-
srns and regressions, in a slow
but gradual ascent towards en-

lightenment and selfunderstand-
ing, and knowledge of the other.

(Thus, ‘one might say, the validi- ‘

ty of Christian truths must at

times be proven almost in spite

.of man.)
Need we add that the first step,

following upon good Will,_ to know- ~
_ ing and understanding the other

is through learning his language?
Are__not the benefits accuring from

. such a study self-evident? The

contact with new ideas always
stimulates our thought, raises us
from our lethargy, prevents exces-
sive complacency, and challenges
-our own notions. ‘ 4

.How often have not nations re-
ceived a fresh impetus from con-

tact withother peoples, their com- ,
-merce been revitalized, their art‘

been regenerated and invigorated,

economic recovery made pos-

sible? But ignoring all political,
economic, and practical reasons,
there remains yet the purer and
nobler purpose of "knowing the
other, his ideas and thoughts,
through knowing his language, and
thus enrich our own self .

JWPGH

Biafra Drive

Nets $225

Parents, SAGA food workers,
students. and Oakland business-
men all combined to make the
recent WPGH eight-day mara-
thon a resounding success. Joanne
Telerico, former acting general
manager of WPGH. said, “We
were very, very pleased with the
results. We took in $225 for the
children of Biafra. I

The money has been turned
over to UNICEF, a United Na-
tions organization, that can turn
each nickel into 30 glasses of
milk or four tuberculosis vaccines.
Turning the money over to
UNICEF was very gratifying to
the WPGH staff, but the general
acceptance of the radio station by
the student body was also heart-
warming.

Many students asked about the
‘possibility of moving the WPGH
-studios down -to the Towers Lob-
bies permanently. At the present

time it would not be financially —

feasible. Duffy Taylor, the new
general manager ‘of WPGH, said,
however, that the University" ra-

dio station would certainly enjoy
moving back down to the Towers
for another benefit.

Know what we found out in a hurry?
We found we could rent three whole rooms

Offensive Vets Barr, Allen

By MARTHA HARTEL A T T,  _ ' 

. 7 Jeff Barr and Warren Allen, both veterans from last year’s I - ’ A = A

offensive squad, have moved over to defense this fall and they

-couldn’t be happier.
. Barr, a 6’2”, 194 pound junior from Canton,~Ohio, started several

- games last year as quarterback, but his first love is defense. This .
aspiring he’s moved over to defensive halfback and is in a good position

_ to land a starting job.

At 6’1”, 190 pounds, Allen was

a small ‘quick guard last season.

The junior letterman from Home-
stead remained on offense until
last week when the coaches
moved him, over to defensive end.

“The move was a surprise,” ex-

plained Allen, “but I’m happy_

with it. I like defense better be-
cause you’re out in the open more
and in on more of the action.”

Barr‘ wasalso enthusiastic a-
bout the switch (over to defense.
“I love it,” he quipped. “I en-
joy defense much better than of-
fense. I don’t have to worry as
much as I had to at quarterback.
I couldn’t be happier.”

The move to defense was no sur-
prise for Barr however. He had an-
ticipated the switch long before
it actually came.

“I thought I’d play there‘ last
year,” he continued,” and I play-
ed there a lot my freshman year.”

Neither veteran found much
difficulty in making the adjust-
ment to the new positions. “The
main problem I found,” explain-
ed Allen, “was to adjust to hitting
people and looking out for block-
ers instead of blocking.”

“There were a few things I had
to learn and get adjusted to,” com-
mented Barr, “but most of it just

Bemis Notes Progress

by ED CONLEY
Coach Leo Bemis’ soccer squad held its first scrimmage

mistic as ever.

, last Saturday and the coach came away pleased and as opti-

The scrimmage was against a group of foreign students
here at the university, a group that Bemis considers “a re-

T ponsible team.”

The varsity players won the game, 2-1, but that was not important

" ’ to Bemis. His players had practiced little in the way of handling the

ball or aiming at a goal in their previous practice sessions.

In a year where conditioning
will be emphasized Coach Bemis
stated, “I think they" did fairly
well. This scrimmage gave me a
chance to know where we are.”

As to where the team is, Bem-
is relates, “We’re getting there.

1 ' . After all, we hadn’t had a minute’s

shooting time. The fact that we
won tells us something.”

This game also gave Bemis his
first look at the sophomore’s in
action as varsity players. He is
quoted in the 1968 Soccer Pamph-
let as saying, “Our success rests
an, awful lot on how well the
sophomores react.”

There were plenty of these sophs
in the scrimmage Saturday, and
Bemis was impressed by many of
them. Dave DiEmido, who scor-
ed a goal, and Ron Bugaj were
two of the standouts.

Randy Dry, a lineman and Cliff
Arbes, a fullback, also looked like
they’ll be important members of
this year’s team.

Conference Lekoma, an Afri-
can, figures to be a great addition
to the booters if he is permitted
to play. There is a chance that
he may not qualify, but Bemis
feels that the fact that he is a
fulltime undergraduate student
should make him eligible for play.

All of these players, along with
the returneesfrom last year will
,t_ry_to find the secret to scoring.
10' ‘..a11.,§-._th9.. r.s:tu;r.nees..«only one

    

scored last fall. That was Bob
Trexler who notched one goal.

The fact that the team came_
up with two goals in their first
“game” makes Bemis think that
his squad is “getting the habit.”

WARREN ALLEN
Switches Sides

came naturally and it didn’t take
too long. I played a lot of defen-
sive halfback in high school and
as a freshman so the switch real-
ly didn’t bring much difficulty. ’-’
Defensive end is a new pos-
ition for Allen. He played de-
fense in high school, but not at
end. As a freshman, however, he
was touted by the coaches as one

of the best natural defensive line- I

men on the team.”

Both Barr and Allen are fac-
ing keen competition for start;
ing roles. “We have a lot of good
kids in the secondary,” explained
the ex-signalcaller Barr. “Last
spring we were two deep at every
position.”

“Competition is great every
where on the team, at every spot,”
added Allen. “It’ll be hard to
make the first team. There won’t
be any walk on jobs.”

Both boys agree, however, that
the competition is going to bring
some changes this year. “We’re
definitely going to win this year,”
concluded Allen emphatically. “I
can’t see how we could lose.”

 

Frosh Gridders Start
Practice Sessions With
No-Contact Work-outs

By JERRY L. GRUEBEL
Opening frosh football practices resembled a health educa-
tion class, full of healthy boys trying to impress the instructor.

Wearing sweat pants and sweat shirts, the new recruits and strug-
gling walk-ons spent most of the practice drills doing push-ups, iso-sit-

ups, rolls, and sprints.

But the utilitylfield behind Trees Hall is what really made the drills‘

look like Health Education 1 class.
The ground was without a blade
of grass and ass hard as the floor
of the gymnasium in Tress Hall.

“At least we won’t ruin the
floor here,” said freshman foot-
ball coach Karl Kokor, while hu-
morously comparing the Trees
Hall gymnasium with the All-
Purpose Utility Fields.

Kokor didn’t appear too wor-
ried concerning the problem of
where to play.

“We’ll be working around the
varsity,” explained Kokor. “On
Mondays the varsity goes _over
the films of the ‘next opposing
team, so we’ll use Trees Field.
Also, we’ll be able to use Trees
Field Thursdays after 5:30, Fri-
days, and Saturday mornings.’’.

In the meantime; Kokor real-
ly doesn’t have to worry anyway.
The Cubs will be getting only
light work-outs for the next two
weeks. During that period, Ko-
korhopes to get his boys in shape
and weed out the walk-ons.

Kokor is also trying to find out
just who can play what. .

“All the boys will be kicking,
passing, catching, and running,”
explained Kokor. “Some of them
might excel] in phases of the
game they’ve never played for some
reason or another. We want to find
that out.”

Kokor’s frosh team is smaller
than last year’s highly touted
squad, but Kokor is optimistic.

  

 

QUICK AS A RABBIT, sophomore quarterback Dave Havern (white
shoes) leaves one opponent flat on his face while eluding anotherNdur-
ing Saturday’s scrimmage at Trees Field. Havern is slated to start against

UCLA.

Technicalities Changed For
Current Football Campaign

Several rules have been changed for the 1968 college foot-
ball season. Probably the most dramatic was the rescinding of
the 1967 punt rule. Interior offensive linemen will no longer be

restrainedat the line of scrim-
mage‘ until after the ball is kick-
ed.

- Also there is a radical revision
involving the basic scrimmage for-
mation and the eligibility of for-
ward pass receivers insofar as nu-
mbering of players is concerned.
Briefly:

1. On a scrimmage down there
must be at least seven players
on the offensive scrimmage line,
of which at least five must be
numbered 50 through 79.

2. Only the players on each
end of the scrimmage line are
eligible receivers, and theymust
wear numbers other than 750 thru'
79 in order to be. eligible. .A- max-
;imum of .-two :2 eligible; receivers

   

   

    

can be on the line at one time.

3. Any player who is legally in
the backfield is an eligible re-

_ceiver only if he is wearing a

number other than 50 through 79.

Other changes include fair
catch situations, legalized clip-
ping, and time outs.

On a kick, any player who makes
a signal for a fair catch, and does
not touch the ball. may not block
an opponent during that down.
Penalty is a 15-yard loss.

Players who are stationed five

I or more yards outside of the clip-

ping area (legalized clipping area
approximately three yards on ei-

, ther side of the line), or who are

“We have some boys that are as

quick as cats,” said_ Kokor excited- '

ly, “Dykes and Kuziel will both
be competing for center, but Dy-
kes also plays tackle. They both
move like cats. ”

_ All the boys have real good at-
t1tudes,”‘ continued Kokor." But
all the boys have a lot to prove.

List Shrinks;
Defense Up

Injuries and . continued im-
provement tell the present
story of the football team as
it begins to gear itself for the
season opener, less than two
weeks away at UCLA.

Assistant head coach Bill Neal,
expounding the everpresent opti-
mism, feels that the defensive
team has finally come into its
own.

“The defense really showed
something at Saturday’s scrim-
mage,” he said. “We were begin-
ning to become a little_worried
about the defense’s progress, but
Saturday’s performance dispelled
most of our fears.

From tackle to tackle we are
going to give our opponent's a
tough time when they try to go
up the middle,” Neal continued.
“Our pass and rush defense are
markedly improved, and we have
cut down on our mental and physi-
cal errors. The only thing we lack
is overall quickness and speed,
especially on our outside contain-
ment.”

The other opitmistic news con~’

cerns the injury list, which has
finally begun to shrink. Defensive
ends Bob Ellis and Paul Napon-
ick have returned to active duty
after being out for the past week
and a half with pulled thigh mus-
cles. The duo expects to be up to
full power by the Bruin game.

Another encouraging word con-

cernis the -defensive “prowler,” ‘

Dave Dibbley. He’s been out the
past two weeks with a pulled
hamstring muscle.

“I’ve regained most of my mo-
bility and agility, but I still can’t
sprint. One way or another, I’ll.
be at UCLA,”. said a determined
Dibbley.

Barring any other major injur-
ies, the Panther squad should be

at full strength for the opener and _

roaring for an upset. ‘

dent, too. Only three of last year’s
starters are gone, although that
includes the left side of the in-
field. The Kappa Sigs generate
a balanced attack, lining six sol-
id hitters through "the middle of
‘the lineup.

The defending champion’s top
players include captain Larry
Lesniak, Charles Wise at first
base, Joe Diederick in center, and
senior Bill Green behind the
plate.

Perhaps the most patriotic fel-
low was from Delta Phi — former-
ly Lambda Sigma Rho — who said,
“We’re gonna kill everybody. Un-
der a new name and a new

strength of brotherhood, we final-_

ly feel our athletic program is go-
ing to come around..”

Brotherhood may help, but not
much unless short-centerfielder

Larry Wonders hits .498 again ,

and Randy Norris collects a few

 RBI’s.

Phi Kappa Alpha finished sec-
ond lasf ’ year and expects better
this season. Practically the same
team returns in addition to a cou-
ple top newcomers. A strong in-
field is anchored by A1l—Star
shortstop Mike Diloriso with ten-
nis buffs Bill Nichols (third base)
and Bob Salembrier (first base)
at the corners.

Conversely, Phi Gamma Delta
is strong in the outfield and be-
hind the plate. The Figi’s, pri-
marily a hitting club, list left-
fielder John La Frankie as their
top hitter, followed by John Hut-
ton (CF), Bill Snee (RF), and Don
.Yarling as catcher. The Figi’s are
a tough crew and will be battling
all the way. -

SAE also lists a “powerful” out-
field, but throws in a star pitcher
to boot. Last season, Al Seller
“fired” a no—hitter against the Fi-
gi’s. On the basis of his arm and
the hitting of flychasers Tony An-

) zelmo, a rookie, veteran Tim Car-
damone, and John Mahoney, Sig-
ma Alpha Epsilon expects to un-
seat Kappa Sig. ‘

But Theta Chi feels it has just
the right combination of rookies
and veterans to come in with a
first or second place finish. Re-

A IM Preview

KappaSig Defends Title

Special to ‘the Pitt .\'eu‘s .
The same cockiness and optimism that characterized the
pre-season look at the intramural fraternity “A” league was

more than evident among the athletic chairman of those teams in" the?
fraternity “B” league that are looking to unseat last year’s champion‘

However, the Kappa Sigs look to be in good shape and very confi”-V

 
  
   
  
    

turning stars are Barry Buchanan,-1
a good stick man, in left field,
and Mike Block at sh o r t s t op:
Rookies B o b Wingard (second.
base) and Rocco Fioravanti (third;
base) solidify the infield. ’ A 

Overall, it looks like arugged
race in “B” league. Most of the,
teams seem to be counting ‘on’
heavy hitting attacks,but a couple,
have stacked defenses. As Casey,
Stengel once said, “A solid infield
loses_ fewer games.” But then
again, was Casey Stengel a Greed?~--
