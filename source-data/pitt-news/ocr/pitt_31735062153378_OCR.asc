BISHOP HENDERSON
CHAPEL SPEAKER

Noted Leader of’ Methodism
. Likens Life to an Athletic~Con-
_» test and Advises How to Play
the Game. f A .

Bishop Theodore S. Henderson of
the’Methodist Church of Chattanoo-
ga, Tenn. was the speaker at the gen-
eral assembly last Friday morning.

The main idea-of his lecture was a
comparison between a life and an at-
letic contest. “Life is a_ game to be
played)’ said Bishop. ‘Henderson. -“In
order" to play successfully we must
follow. theserules. The first is Play"
under the right coach. That is fol-
low God and Jesus Christ. The right

I coach is the main thing. Good ma-

terial may be spoilt by a bad coach-
Bad material may be developed into
a winning team through the inﬂuence
or a good coach. .

.. “The second -rule of this ‘game is

Develop the fine points of the game,
for a victory is nearly always gained
on, a fine point and by a. small mar-.
gin. We niust know the rules and
,we must test them out everywhere.
“Knowing these rules we must do
three other things. We must sign
up, line up, and play up.’ <We must
enter the ﬁeld of life, not in the
grand stand, but in the » scrimmage.

. We must play the game to the best

of our ability. In this I way we can
hope to achieve success.

“Moreover we must play our own.
positions on this great team and we
must ‘co-operate with the other play-
ers. We must use team work. That

is we must help our fellow men in
this great game of 1lfe.’_’

are extremely anxious to be on the

they are trying to make other ar-

A few of the junior students tried
to make arrangements with one of

- vtherailroads to ship them byfreight

under the head of livestock;

Such a mode. ‘of transportation
would have cost them they believed,
somewhere in the neighborhood of
$5 or $6 for the round trip.

They would carry their meals. with
them, and would maketheir beds of
straw on the ﬂoor of the car.

The movement wase looked into by
the Hli-Kockey Club» who expected to
go up in a body and invite other

Wmembers of the school who wished

to accompanytheimu.
_ Students who have resolved to get
to ,the game even if freight hopping
was the only other “means; the
freight car proposition being killed;
immediately set out to ‘see the differ-
ent railroads for lower rates.
‘Arrangements for a day coach at-
tachment on the B. & 0. Railroad
are almost completed for the ,. small
sum of about 38, this being just half
the original fare. E . .
If arrangements with the B. &_ 0.
should fall through some of the stu-
dents who still. have the following
story concerning‘ the Michigan , lad
fresh in their minds; have determin-
ed to reach the game by the " same

Harvard, a certain scout on the Mich-
igan. team asked Coach Yost if he
woulditake him to ‘Cambridge. "No,"
said Yojst, “but I’ll put you on the
side lines it you make the distance
in a freight car.” Without further
parley’ the scout went home, threw
some football togs into a suit case,
and that very afternoon he boarded
a side-door pullman headed East. I-Iye
landed in Cambridge the afternoon
of the game. He then proceeded to
walk throu'gh- the slide-in gate just be

most, loath tobelievethat any man
could have been subject to such ab-
rupt removal, without an element of
persecution on the part of a “corpora-
tion" of menlnwho undeniably repre-
sent the institution of capital and in
many cases, the vested interests of
the United «States. We have, as the
author‘. of the above-mentioned article
states, ‘a. very large degree of concur-
rence with a majority of Professor
Nearing’s doctrines and teachings.

of ca

_Certainly we belong to the more radi-

cal school of thinkers upon many

economic and social problems, if

such a digniﬁcation can be made.
We have nevertheless, weighing all

the evidence, as fully as we could

ascertain -it, come to the conclusion
that the Board was entirely within
its legal and moral rights, that Pro-
fessor Nearing has not been the ob-
ject of corporate persecution, and that
the intellectual and moral integrity
‘of the American University and
reasonably interpreted -freedom of
academic speech, have not, in the
slightest degree, been impeached.
The. mental evolution through which
we have gone to ranch this rather con-
servative attitude, is too long to . be
gone into at length, ‘or to set, down
all the evidence or causes leading
thereto. Says the Indianapolis News,
“The discharge of a professor is not
in itself proof that academic freedom
has been abridged, though there are
some who seempto think so." It has
been a favorite course; in regard to
the Nearing dispute, to jump, immedi-

ately to -the conclusion that the Board,

must have « had ulterior motives for
the dismissal of a man who so obvi-
ously, in his written and public utter-
ances, opposing the methods by which
they hadigained their wealth, and by
which the University of Pennsylvania
is itself supported I

We cannot see the justice or good
sense of this accusation. Isa Board
of Trustees, though composed ‘of men

opposite in"bellef.and practiceto the-

man in question, unable to dissociate
‘its public from its private action?
Are men who would naturally be ex-
pected to have the best, interests of
their University at heart, who have
labored long and faithfully and sacri-
ﬁcially for her support by the “edu-

cational donations,” which Dr. Near-.

ing condemns, but which, neverthe-
less,-have been suﬂicient in the past
to pay his salary without a protest on
his part, necessarily guilty upon mere
assertion, without the ghost of op-
portunity to clear themselves? Such

an attitude controverts the fund.amen- ‘

tal principles of American justice.
The cumulative force of . incidents
which typify Dr. Nea‘ring’s‘ lll-con-
sidered utterances before public, and
not simply academic audiences, and of
his frequent lack of mental balance,
has been suﬂicient to convince these
Trustees that his continuance in the

institution was a positive disadvan-
tage, There are-many" professors’ in‘
-the University of Pennsylvania, whose

doctrines’ and opinionsare moi'e.“radi-_
cal” than those Dr. Nearing has de-
livered, but these men have neither
been released nor antagonized by the
B_oard, because they tempered their
teachings with some degree of apprec-
iation for the rights of others. .If
there were anything needed to put a
capstone of conviction upon the case,
it is the manner in which Professor
Nearing is now earning his living, viz.,
by the‘publication of sensational ar-
ticles in the papers of the William
Randolph“ Hearst syndicate, notably
the New York American, than which

these facts, and the deﬁnite informa-

whose eligibility was in question, was
unable to play on account of injuries,
Tech cancelled the game. With these

Tech was ﬁghting not merelyvherg own
battle for decency in athletics, but
was the champion and protagonist of
every institution, the ‘country over,
which is trying to adopt and live up

intercollegiate athletics. .

In our mind, West Virginia has not
a leg to stand on in its case for Rod-
gers, and the attitude of the student
body and the faculty of the University
is quite incomprehensible to us. We
are equally at a loss to account for
Washington and Jefferson's servile
submission the Saturday before, in al-
lowing Rodgers to be played against
the Red and Black. Had W. & J. tak-
en the right course then, the ques-

least two counts, _either one OI which

should serve to disqualify "him.
These are the one-year‘ migratory rule,

and the four-years’ collegiate football

rule. Rodgers is in his first year of
attendance at the West Virginia. Insti-
tution, having previously
Bethany College, Bethany, W. Va. for
four years, during two of which he
was a student in the College depart-
ment, and before that in the prepara-
tory department. During all those
years, he played collegiate football,
representing Bethany College on its
varsity teams. All these facts are
conceded by the West Virginia au-
thorities. The
these aberrations read as follows :
1. No student who has participated
in any department of athletics for

any college or university shall repre- ,
sent the University (1. e., a5 member
of the Bi-State Association), during.

the following year.

2. No student shall represent the
University in any M
games or contests, who haslcompeted

for the University or any other insti- "
tutions granting collegiate ‘ degrees,

during four previous years. ,

We can see no
of these rules that could possib-
ly relieve either Rodgefs or the West

Virginia authorities of responsibility

in the matter. The one-year migra-

tory rule is so axiomatic upon its face

that the present violation can have
absolutely no defense. In the other
case, we will ask but one question,
viz., When a man plays on a varsity
football team, is beer is he not. rep-
resenting the college whose name that

team bears? The question of wheth-

er he was taking collegiate or

academic work at the time does not

enter into the matter in the slightest
degree. The explanation of West

annual.

In the past years, books
every imaginable design-shape,
and cover material have
thrust" upon the defenseless stu-
dents, with. the result that any stu-
dent or alumnus, who desired to
maintain a library collection ‘of the
university annuals‘, wou1d.have,stai_'-

ing ‘him in the face an"aggreg'ation-

of volumes more closely resembling a

highly variegated row of seed catal-

ogues than the time honored»i'.ecord"s
of their University life as interpreted
by the‘ students of the time.

In the earlyyears of the Owl's ex-
istence, when an attempt to issue any
manner of publication ,.was almost
sure to react disastrously from "a
ﬁnancial standpoint, this course was
undoubtedly unavoidable; but now
that the student activities of the Uni-
versity have reached a. stage as to be
self-supporting, it is time that some
decisive action were made in stand-
ardizing the» Owl. The reasons for
such an action are especially obvious,
not only that the library collection
may present an orderly appearance,
identical in size and binding, with
volume indicated, but for the sake of
dignifying the appearance of each
individual volume. It is high time
that an annual book, published re-
gularly by the Junior class for the
students and alumni ‘of their Univer-
sity as a memoir-of a year’s college
life, should cease to bear the outward
appearance of 5a‘stray5 catalogue, and
assume the position of respect to

.which it is entitled as the ofﬂcial

portrayer of student life.

5 We might suggest that last year's
Owl might be taken in partas a mo-
del for the standardizing of the an-
nual, as it embodies in external ap-
pearance the proper requisites.for a
book of its size and character. To
maintain this _plan,_ the 1917 Board
has of their own accord agreed to con-
form in essential details to the type
last year’s

and particularly the new ones, of the
University of Pittsburgh, the Carne-

entertainment at the present time is
the farce, the vogue of which is due in
a large ‘measureto the _clean,., whole-
some fun and bright action of such
popular laugh-producers as last sea-
son’s notable success, “A Pair .of
Sixes,” and this year’s triumph,’ “A Full
House.” This latter play will be the
attraction at the Alvin Theater for the
week beginning Monday, October 18.

“A Full House” was the laughing hit
of New ‘York last season, when the
critics praised the ingenious develop-
ment of its amusing story, the clever
dialogue and the incessant action. The
play was written by Fred Jackson, un-
tried as a. dramatist, but a most suc-
cessful contributor of ﬁction to the_
popular magazines, and was produced
by H. H. Frazee,iwho seems to know
how to pickgood farces.

Hundreds of people participated- in

is particularly true as regards the

elders of the church and of the gyp-

where Babble, running through the

_woods, encountered the dominie and
.threw about the spell other witchery.

The great rainstorm, during which
one of the dominie’s converts decides
to relieve the dominie of the sinister
spell he believes Babble has cast over
Gavin and resolves to kidnap her, is
described as one ofthe most realistic
achievements in all the screens dra-

ALUMNI cnuNcN T0  
illlNVlENE AT M. A

An innovation will be started in con-
nection with the quarterly meeting ‘of
the Alumni -Council of the University
next Monday, October 18th, notices
sent out last Saturday from the oﬂ_ice
of the -General Secretary announcing
that the meeting will be held at the
Pittsburgh Athletic Association at 6

-P. M. sharp, this to ‘be followed by the _

business meeting. A dollar rate, with
10 cents service charge, has been se-
cured at the P. A. A. and several
large" private rooms have been pro-
vided for the meeting._ 4
It is hoped .that this new plan will
help’ to “boost” up the attendance at
Council meetings and thereby put
“pep” in the entire alumni proposition.
There will be four of these dinners
held during the year, if the October
one is successful, they being arrang-
ed for onthe usual meeting dates,
the third Monday in the months of
March,,May, October and December.
In order that the Secretary may
know how. many to prepare for, it is
essential that members of Council ad-
vise by letter‘ or phone before Friday
evening if he shall be counted in.
If impossible to attend the dinner,
members are urged to at least be out
for the business meeting between 7
and 8 P. M.
- This meeting of Council "should be
a very important one as it is the ﬁrst

held by that body since the June -.

election. Alexander Silyerman, '02,
who was re-elected to the chairman-
§hip, will presidef. tA1l‘ chairmen have
been urged to get their committees t.o-
gether to map out plans or for the
year and they expect to have a writ-
ten report at the meeting Monday.

The Alum'ni Secretary will present
a report telling of some ings that
have been accomplished long the
line of “boosting” alumni affairs, and
some plans for the future.

Members of Council should all make
it a point to be there and “boost” ‘for
100 per cent attendance. The matter
of attendance at Council’s meetings is
going to be carefully watched from
now on and those who cannot ﬁnd
it convenient to attend will be drop-
ped, in accordance with the provis-
ions of the Constitution and By-Laws.

The following are chairmen of the
Council’s iCommittees:_—-Finance, W. C.

The following excerpt received from
J. -Clare George, Econ. ’15, tells how
some of the recent “grads” of Pitt in
New Castle, Pa., are doing;

“I ﬁnd upon looking around that the

The University . of . Pittsburgh,
through the courtesy of the Athletic
Council, will again entertain the foot-
ball teams of the various secondary
schools of - western Pennsylvania,
eastern Ohio, and West Virginia at
the varsity games played at Forbes
Feld. That is an annual affair and a
delightful visit is planned for each
team. Aside from the visit to Forbes
Field, where the teams witness the
University athletes clash with their
rivals, they are conducted through

the various departments of the Uni-=

versity and are given an opportunity
to ‘observe many characteristic fea-
tures of the institution itself.

This year invitations have been ex-
tended to one hundred and twenty-six
secondary schools, and from present
indications there will be but a few-
teams unable to take advantage of
the invitation.

The schools invited to the Indian-—

HELD 11 GYM.

With feelings of good will and
plenty of “Pitt Spirit” in their hearts,
the ne.w students in the college left-

’V»Trees Gymnasium, Friday night, after

being accorded one of the most suc-
cessful receptions ever given by the
old students to the new ones in the

.~.history of the University.‘ True “Pitt

Spirit” prevailed and the upper class-

_ men mingled with the freshmen, mak-

ing the evening a pleasant one for
all who attended.

The Senate had charge of the pro-
gram, and in the absence of the presi-
dent of the College Senate “Ted” Fry,
who was in Annapolis, upholdings the

' football standard of Pitt, M. N. States,

the president of the General Senate,
presided. Dean Fetterman was the
ﬁrst speaker, and he welcomed the

 new students and the;new members of

the faculty on behalf of the University.
His speech was sparkling with wit

~ and he won his way to the hearts of

the new students and strengthened the
bonds of friendship with the older

. ones, He mentioned two prominent.

men, “whoare -glad to call Pitt their

 Alma. Mater: George W. Guthrie, Am-

 , bassador to Japan,

and Ethelbert

 Nevin, who composed the Rosary.

I The College quartette, composed of
K’. M. Gould,_ F. A. Franklin, W. R.
James and E. Hurrel, accompanied by

V Miss Mildred Morrow, rendered sev-

eral selections, and they responded to
the enthusiasm ‘of the audience with
"numerous encores,

. iynext, speaker, spoke, at length upon

the growth of the University and the

 ne.cessity of the students developing

their minds so as to think clearly and

 reason well. Of course, it was neces-

sary for the freshmen to have some

 advice and Logan Hall was chosen as

. the cessation of.

their lnstruct‘br for the «evening. He
spoke on the subject, “Love,” and
closed by making an earnest plea for
“knocking”. Miss
Irene Garrison and Kenneth Gould
gave the closingnumber in the form-
ol a duet. ’

Refreshments were served, the
chairs were moved to the sides of the
room and dancing was indulged in for

' the remainder of the evening.

 5. Boss ADDRESSES
 cum. ASSEMBLY

_ 7 Atlthe School of Chemistry assem-
Tbly, on Wednesday, -Mr. Joseph E.

 

 

Bobb of the Fort Pitt Oil and Paint
Co. gave an interesting and instruc-
tive talk upon “Lubricants, Their Com-

. position and Manufacture.” Mr. Bobb

"'i_s'E‘”bne°" of'the”t_%1"(§e or fourichenfists
in this country engaged in the manu-
facture of lubricants and is a recog-
nizedauthority on the‘ subject. He
conﬁned himself to a. discussion of
solid lubricants and greases. ‘ These
were divided into seven classes or
-types, and the composition and meth-
od of manufacture of each type dis-
cussed in edtail. As most of this in-
formation is not available in books
the students were Aparticularly for-
tunate in obtaining it ﬁrst hand.

SUBJECT CHOSEN FOR
MOI-IONK CONFERENCE

Conference of New York, which is or-
ganized for the promotion of inter-
collegiate oratorical contests. The
contest this year will be »the eighth

commendable representations to the
conference in previous contests. In
1913 Louis Broido chose the subject,
“National Honor and Peace,” and won
first prize from the State and took the
second National prize.
. . Roy D. Boaz’s essay on, “Democ-
racy and Universal Peace,” submit-I

All essays should reach the Secre- '

tary of the Conference not later than
March 15, 1916. The conditions gov-
erning, the contest can be seen on the
biilletinboard of State Hall.

SURPRISED!
Certainly you’ll be’ surprised at
the suit values offered in our
men’s $14.50 ,Clothes Shop.

The suits were selling at this price
were a surprise to us when ﬁrst we
«saw them. We hesitated some
time before deciding to take on a
standard line selling at such a
reasonable price. We feared the
quality could not possibly measure
up to our standard, but the manu-
facturer has proven his line and
the suits themselves have proven
wonders-—-the tailoringis so per-
fect——the models so snappy and up-
to-the—minute-—the » materials so
much above par, and the quality of
the suits as a whole far beyond
what we thought was a pos.sibili;ty.
at such a price. '

These suits at $14.50 surely repre-
sent a value that but few, if any,
can duplieate—-they are Pittsburgh’s

this department will give you a

genuine thrill of surprise, for r

The Suit You Dreamed of at $20.00,
Youqwill Find Here at $14.50.

TICKET ORDER BLANKS

(Continued from page 3)

Alumni have been furnished blanks
for ordering tickets for the W. & J.
and State games. The W. ;& J . blanks
——the white blanks——should be sent to
4-21 Park Bldg., not later than October-
25th. The State orders——-red blanks———
are due before November 11th. Both
can be sent in NOW with checks and
requests will be ﬁlled in the order they
are received. The tickets will, of
course, not be mailed until the week
before the game but the orders will
be carefully ﬁled and ﬁlled in rotation.
Knowing of the great rush for tickets
for the W. & J. game last year, we
urge alumni to send their orders in
right away and not wait until the last
minute. Some are going to be dis-
appointed if they depend on the gen-
eral sale the week before the game.
This also applies to the Penn State
game.

The price of tickets for the W. &
J. and State games is $1.50 reserved
and $2.00 box. - .

The Musical club “Old Guard,” led
by “Jack” High, ’91, the newly elect-
ed director of the Glee Club, “Sam”
Stewart, ’97, “Punch” Laughlln and
other “high lights” are going to at-
tend the W; & J. game in a body and

ﬁeld. Notices have been mailed to all
members of the Old Guard, telling
them of plans and urging them to get
in with this crowd. The boxes will be
appropriately decorated andthe “Old
Guarders” will do some great rooting
and singing. This gathering of the
“Old -Guard” is indeed a commendable
move and starts a tradition which it
is hoped will. be continued annually.
“Punch” Laughlin is handling the
ticket sales, in connecti n with the
Graduate Manager of thletics. If
orders are set to the latter, specify if
they are wanted in the “-Old Guard”
boxes. '
