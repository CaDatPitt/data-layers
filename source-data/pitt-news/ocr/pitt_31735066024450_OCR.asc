UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH VOEUME EIGHTY-SIX, ISSUE SEVENTY-FOUR

O’Connor installation to cost $92,550

By Jenna Ferrara
News Editor

The university will spend
$92,550 to officially install J.
Dennis O’Connor as chancellor
in a ceremony including a $27,550
private dinner, but state officials
have condemned the installation
as inappropriate spending.

The announcement came
shortly after Gov. Robert Casey
proposed decreasing Pitt’s state
appropriation by $5.8 million.
Casey, state Auditor General
Barbara Hafer and Allegheny
County Commissioner Larry Dunn
have sharply_criticized Pitt for
holding the ceremony while
considering a raise in tuition.

University spokesperson Tim
Ziaukas said the money for the
installation will come from
“unrestricted income from private
sources.’’ ,

According to Ziaukas, $100,000
was set up in a special fund 18
months ago to pay for the

being used, ‘he said, and alumni
will donate $10,000 toward the
cost of the ceremony.

“The installation committee was
very sensitive to the issue of cost
and worked to bring the
installation in at a reasonable
budget,” Ziaukas said. O’Connor
has held the office of president
since Aug. 1, 1991.

O’Connor’s installation
ceremony represents a honorable
university tradition, Pitt officials
said. “It’s the presentation of our
president to the higher education
community,” said Pitt Provost
Donald Henderson in a prepared
statement. Henderson said the
cost of the ceremony represented
“a functional budget which
permits a dignified installation of
our president. To do anything
else is demeaning.”

Ziaukas said “anything less than
the [ceremony] would be
undignified. It’s a traditional thing.
The ritual of installation goes
back to medieval universities 

take special note of.”

Installation costs include
$14,110 for academic symposia,
$15,550 for the ceremony and
$68,550 for hospitality costs,
including the dinner.

“It does sound like a lot of
money,” said Student
Government Board President Gil
Golden. “But it is very important
that the university maintain a
positive public image. The
question is, is this going to help
or hurt the university’s image?”

Golden said people invited to
the ceremony might be inclined
to donate money to the university.
“A lot more will be contributed to
university than the ceremony
cost,” he said.

According to Golden, the
ceremony is necessary because
“the university hasn't had a
chancellor in so long. We haven’t
had something to celebrate in a
long time.”

The ceremony will begin on
Feb. 28, which is also Founders

Casey budget to cut
university funding

The University of Pittsburgh may lose $5.9 million in state
funding if Gov. Robert Casey’s proposed budget is approved

“We are extremely disappointed with the governor’s proposed
4.2-percent reduction  I believe that funding higher education
must remain a high priority. In the long run, this state’s future

I will depend on the quality of education offered today. This
proposed budget threatens that quality and threatens that
future,” Pitt President J. Dennis O’Connor said.

Pitt currently receives $139.9 million in state funding. Under
the new budget, the university will receive $134.1 million for
the 1993 fiscal year, which begins July 1.

Casey announced his plan to reduce $76 million in funding
to Pitt and state—assisted private universities Penn, Drexel and
Jefferson during his annual budget message to the state General

All four schools will receive a 3.5—percent reduction. Casey
suggested the universities make cuts to compensate for the loss,

compensate for the lost funding. “To make up for these

State Rep. Stephe.n Freind joined about

_ 60 pro-life protesters Saturday who
 marched in front of Women’s Health

Services, a clinic which performs abortions

A and provides gynecological exams.

Members of several Pitt student groups

‘ attended to show their support for the

pro-choice movement.
About 45 pro-choice activists and

" volunteers in yellow “Pro-choice Escort”

T—shirts helped guide women into the

‘ clinic past the marchers.

One protester walked up to people

_ entering the clinic and murmured, “Please
, choose life.” Another shouted to a woman
' walking into the clinic, “They’ll sterilize

you. Accidents happen.”

Marchers paced back and forth holding
signs which read “Physical or Emotional

“We’ll pray for you, dear,” a protester
said as police led Kaminsky out ofthe line
of pro-life marchers.

“They said I was causing a disturbance,”
Kaminsky said, “but all I said was ‘blah,
blah, blah.”’

Freind, who brieﬂy addressed the crowd,
said, “I see all of you down here in the
snow and in the cold, and not one of you
has a vested financial interest. You're
doing it because you believe it in your

it is right. I am part of you — the pro-life

victory. I.et’s hang in, and We’re going to
win this. God bless all of you.”

The marchers shouted “Amen” and
“Thank you” to Freind who replied, “No

SGB members attend Campus violence conference

By Julie Sabol

News Assistant

Student Government Board
members said the National
Campus Violence Conference
they attended this weekend will
help them establish an escort
service and other safety
precautions at Pitt.

The conference, which cost
close to $1,800, focused on open
forums on campus safety, safety-
awareness programs and

improving communication on
campus.

“ SGB President on Golden said,
“This is a top priority, and I feel
very strongly that safety is
something we had to address.
We will be of much more help to
the students if we understand the
situation and know what is going
on at other campuses. We don’t
want to risk doing too little
because our campus can never
be too safe.”

Four board members were

officially registered for the
conference because five
workshops were held
simultaneously during each
session. Though the SGB usually
is allocated two trips per year, it
cancelled one of them in order to
attend this national conference.
The conference was made up
of sessions led by police chiefs,
FBI agents and public safety
officials. Date rape, escort services
and crime prevention was

, discussed.

Board members Daniel Leichter

and Christopher Skutches said
they liked the Personal
Responsibility for Ourselves, a
crime—prevention program
because it deals with personal
responsibility and education.
“You have to get to the point
where you can be confident with
yourself. I want to set up seminars
and guest speakers to teach
students about personal
responsibility concerning safety.
What you don’t know might kill

you. It’s an educational process,”
Leichter said.

He also said instructing
resident assistants, Freshman
Studies teachers and mentors in
teaching personal responsibility
would be very beneficial.

“You should go for the people
freshmen can relate to,” Leichter
said. .

Board members said one of the

problems at Pitt is the lack of

Fraternities plan to hold open rush

By Heather Gahres
Sta_ﬂ‘ Writer

A poor winter rush has
prompted Pitt fraternities to hold
one week ofinformal, open rush.

At this week’s Inter-Fraternity
Council meeting, members
elected to hold one week of open
rush starting Sunday, Feb. 23 and
ending Thursday, Feb. 27.

IFC Rush Co-Chairman Iiric
Scerbo said, “I think we did have
a poor winter rush, but I don’t
think open rush will do anything
miraculous. However, we do want
to increase the numbers. Without
numbers the Greek system won’t
survive.”

Normally, each fraternity
averages 10 pledges from winter
rush. This year the number has
been cut in half.

II’() members said poor
planning caused the low turnout.
Many rush events were scheduled
during home basketball games.
They were also unable to
publicize rush events because
the student newspaper did not

begin production until after rush
had ended.

IFC Internal Vice President
David Matta said he came up
with the idea of a week for open
rush because several houses had
planned on petitioning to do it
individually.

“The main goal for the IFC and
mine is to get the numbers back
to where they used to be, because
it's important. The idea of open
rush is to help all of the houses
do well,” Matta said.

Sigma Alpha Mu’s Rush Chair
Jason Harmon spoke out against
the plan. He said SAM has tried
midterm rush in the past and it
was not successful.

“I feel that rush is getting to
know one another — both the
houses getting to know the
rushees and the rushees getting
to know the houses,” Harmon
said. “Unfortunately in a hastily
organized midterm rush, the only
thing you see is a first impression,
which gives the fraternities with
large houses an unfair advantage
and takes away the aspects of

being personal.”

Harmon also questioned what
would make open rush any
different than winter rush. “I feel
the time would be better spent
preparing for a strong fall rush,”
he said.

IFC Rush Co~Chairman Edward
Ifft said,”I think anything to
increase the members in the
Greek system is good because
that is what we are here for.
Hopefully, this will help the
smaller houses and the big ones
that didn’t do so well to get back
on their feet."

According to Greek adviser
Bridget Guernsey, there were
rushees who failed to get their
bids in by the deadline and
who still want to join the
fraternities.

“People didn’t realize rush was
over and still wanted to join the
fraternities. This will give them
an opportunity to do that,” she
said.

Open rush will not be
mandatory for any of the
fraternities. The IFC is only giving

the fraternities that wish to
participate a chance to gain in
membership.

IFC also elected their 1992
Judicial Board. Tom Reinhold
from Pi Kappa Alpha, Jeremy
Weiss from Pi Lambda Phi, Jason
Huey from Phi Delta Theta, Ian
Fisher from Theta Chi and Doug
Siege] from Phi Gamma Delta
were elected.

Reinhold told council members
he wanted more contact hours
with the individual houses so
they will be familiar with the IFC
policies and community—service
programs that houses will be
required to participate in if they
violate the rules.

Weiss told council members
the Judicial Board should not be
used as a policing unit. He also
said he would continue his policy
of “no name calling, and no
favoritism.”

In other Greek business, after
recolofiizing last semester, the
sisters of Theta Phi Alpha have
reached their enrollment limit of
65 members.

University AIDS researcher started
career as French literature student

By Vincent Gadrix
For T be Pitt News

When the Pittsburgh AIDS
Center for Treatment opened in _
1989, Dr. Susan Hunt was the
only attending physician. As
PACT’s medical director, she has
seen the center grow to include
an administrative director, a
nurse—practitioner, a clinical
a financial
interviewer and two part—time

social worker,

physicians.

For Hunt, this growth represents I
the medical profession’s increased
interest in spending more time

‘fighting the AIDS epidemic.

“I think that is what happens
for people who work in this
epidemic. They come forth and
say they are interested,” she said.

Although she had a lifelong
interest in science, Hunt studied
literature as an

French
undergraduate.

After graduating she lived in
Turkey for a year and then
returned to the United States and
worked at the San Francisco

Museum of Art.

While in San Francisco, Hunt
decided to study health care and
later earned her medical degree
at the University of Washington

in Seattle.

Hunt’s interest in the AIDS
epidemic developed in the early
1980s when she was an intern"
and then a faculty member at
Presbyterian University Hospital.

She said the social and
political issues of the epidemic

contributed to her interest.

“I think that all the people that
work at PACT run up against
social issues —— issues such as
discrimination against patients
who might be different than

someone they are seeking health
care from, or perceived to be
different,” she said.

“The economic issue always
arises in that even if you start out
with money, with the HIV
infection you may not end up
with money. The fact is that our
health-care system in this country
does not pay enough attention to
home services.”

Hunt’s work as both physician
and medical director offers the
challenge of working with HIV-
positive patients and also
coordinating the medical aspect
of AIDS with the administrative,
political _and economic
aspects within Presbyterian
Hospital.

“This is a large hospital, and I
have to work with people who
by definition have many different
priorities, agendas and interests
and work with them in a
constructive way,” she said. “I
think what I have learned from
being the director is appreciating
the complexity of working with
different groups of people
and trying to solve certain
issues.”

Since its opening in 1989, PACT
has evaluated and provided
ongoing treatment for over 400
patients. .

“What's been rewarding is that

the clinic has been so well
received, not just in the
community but within the
hospital,” she said.

“There is a pride that our care
is well given and that we have
earned the respect ofthe patients
and our colleagues.”

She said that the biggest
challenges for PACT through the
’90s will be access to care for
intravenous drug users and
children born to HIV—positive
women. ‘

She said that even though drug
therapy is not a cure for AIDS,
early treatment can help
significantly.

But children and IV drug users
often do not have the financial
resources to go to a clinic, she
added.

Although the AIDS epidemic
poses new challenges each year,
Hunt said when concerned
people work together, it does
make a difference.

“There’s this feeling of being .

able to do a lot more than you
could if you were just an
individual. Any one of us by
ourselves trying to work with the
epidemic would be
overwhelmed. You really realize
the way to make a difference is to

"band together and try to do the
-work.”

Body C01/ziestto raise  
fundsfor weight room

By Julie Sabol

News Assistant

Bulging biceps, washboard stomachs and muscles of all
shapes and sizes will be on display for Pitt students at a special
contest to support the purchase ofnew weight-room equipment
for Trees Hall.

Art Bedway Productions is sponsoring a bodybuilding contest
on March 7 in Soldiers and Sailors Memorial Hall, and $5 of
every ticket sold will be donated to purchase the new equipment.
Art Bedway is a member of the Pitt Ambassadors Club, which
is organized by the Pitt Developmental Office. The Student
Government Board is endorsing the event, which will include
lectures and information about body building and drug abuse.

“The more tickets that are sold on campus, the more money
will be available for the purchase of equipment for the weight
room,” SGB President Gil Golden said.

Last year the weight room was doubled in size, but students
can still be found waiting in lines to use the machines. A
complete new circuit of Cybex selectorized weights will be
added to the room, which would almost double its capacity.
Student Activities fee money will not be used for the weight
room if $40,000 is raised, Golden said.

“Any time there's a student interest and the Student Government

Board feels it’s responsible to do something regarding that
interest, and that something costs money, it’s nice not to have
to draw on the Student Activities" fee," Golden said.

Pharmacy begins gmduozteprogmm

By Mike Laughlin

Staff Writer

Pitt's School of Pharmacy will
begin a two-year graduate
program for students to study
advanced areas oftheir field, such

- as drug therapy or research,

although many pharmacy
students are concerned that
eventually making the Doctor of
Pharmacy program mandatory
will hurt the school.

Juhl said the program responds
to the need to provide advanced
training in pharmacy. Pitt’s world-
renowned medical center, along
with being one of only 75
universities in the country to have
a pharmacy school, makes it
necessary for Pitt to have a
Pharml). program, he said.

The program is intended for
students who want to work in
advanced drug therapy at
hospitals or in research and
development at universities or
the pharmaceutical industry.

’l'he program is now voluntary,
although Juhl said that it will

probably become mandatory for
all pharmacy students by the year
2000, which has caused some
concern among pharmacy-school
students.

‘‘I hope it isn’t a deterrent for
students to go into the program
because it’s longer,” said Renee
Jones, a second—year pharmacy
student.

While she thinks it’s a good
program for career advancement,
she's also concerned that students
who want to become
neighborhood pharmacists will
be dissuaded from going to
pharmacy school because a
mandatory Pharm.D. program

‘would lengthen their time in

school from five to seven years.

“I think it’s good for research,
but you don’t need it for all types
of pharmacy, such as community
pharmacy,” said Smitha
Gangadhar, another second—year
pharmacy student.

Steve Vlasmik, a fifth—year
pharmacy student who plans to
attend Ohio State University to
earn his Pharm.D., is also

concerned that students will be
turned off to pharmacy school
because ofthe lengthening ofthe
program. He’s worried that the
quality of students will decrease
because a drop in pharmacy
school attendance will open up
more slots.

“Many students are not
enthused about Pharm.D.,”
Vlasmik said.

Juhl said the current demand
for pharmacists is so great that
many students receive job
offerings long before graduation.
The demand is created because
people simply use drugs more
than ever before, and the growing
elderly population and its health
problems cause a greater need
for drug therapy.

The Doctor of Pharmacy classes
begin this fall with only six
students enrolled in the program.

To be eligible for the program,
a student must have a bachelor’s
degree from an accreditedfive-
year pharmacy school, according
to Randyjuhl, dean of the School
of Pharmacy.

for candidates with a good

Amnesty continues
human rights efforts

By Kathy Kmiecik
Staff Writer

Amnesty International is working toward the release of
prisoners of conscience, fair and prompt trials for all prisoners
and ending torture and the death penalty, according to Pitt AI
President Ronna Lash.

“Over one—third of the world’s governments routinely use
torture as a means of forcing confession, gaining information
or as a form of punishment,” Lash said.

Lash said AI does not work specifically for or against any
government or political purpose, and it does not
necessarily support the ideologies of the prisoners it works to
free.

In an effort to maintain impartiality, AI chapters are not
allowed to work on abuses in their own country. British AI
members are now conducting investigations involving the Los
Angeles police brutality case of Rodney King.

AI has chapters in over 150 countries and a home office in
London, where researchers determine which cases they will
take. There are two degrees of cases: long-term prisoners and
urgent action cases, on which college chapters usually
concentrate.

According to Lash, a case is classified as urgent if AI
determines there is an ongoing violation of human rights such
as torture, disappearance, health concerns for prisoners, legal
concerns, the death penalty or a hunger strike.

In such a case, A-I members send letters and telegrams to
government officials to stop the violations.

According to Lash, this form of appeal is often successful
because the governments comrgitting the violations usually try

proposed cuts in revenue, the
university may be required to
substantially raise tuition, to
reduce programs and to defer
badly needed renovations,” he
said.

Casey also criticized Pitt for
planning a $92,550 installation
ceremony for J. Dennis
O’Connor during difficult
economic times.

“Casey’s getting on my nerves,”
said Student Government Board
President Gil Golden.

Golden said Casey criticized
Pitt without understanding the
situation and is trying to improve
his public image through

irresponsible comments which

will win him public favor. ,
Golden denounced Casey for

softening his commitment to?‘

the quality of the state’s edu-
cation.

“If I ran on a campaign where
education was one of my primary
issues, I would do more to help
education,” he said.

Aside from possible tuition
hikes, O’Connor said, “The impact
of the proposed budget on Pitt
would be adverse. The university
is the largestemployer in the city
of Pittsburgh and one of the major
economic generators of the

commonwealth. To cut support -

to this university is contrary to
the goals of -everyone in the
commonwealth.”

O’Connor said he will be
working with the legislature to
restore Pitt funds to the budget.

Casey had also proposed
cutting funding to the Pittsburgh
Supercomputing Center, which
is operated by Pitt, Carnegie
Mellon University and
Westinghouse.

O’Connor said the center
“attracts grants and contracts to
the region and thus helps to
create much-needed jobs.”

onored for charity Work

By Scott Nespor
Su¢_[]‘Writer'

Barbara Shore, director of the
doctoral program at Pitt’s School
of Social Work, was honored for
her life's work when she was
chosen to be a Distinguished
Daughter OfPennsylva nia. ShOre’s
humanitarian aid to the poor,
survivors of war, women and
minorities won her the award.

In addition to her administrative
duties at Pitt, Shore also teaches
graduate-level courses. Some Of
the classes deal with death and
dying, family violence, micro-
social science theory and mental
health policy. She also evaluates
research and works on the
dissertation committee.

“The Intervention in Death and
Dying class is overly sul>scril>ed,”
Shore said. “It is one of my
favorites.”

Shore is involved with the
University Senate, where she
chaired the committee that
recommended that "ROTC be
removed from campus by 1993.

“It’s a shame that
organization that
discriminates like [ROTC] is
allowed to function,” she said.

Shore said she hopes that more
women will become involved
with campus issues.

“Pitt is a relatively good school
for women. But things would be
a whole lot better if there were
more women faculty, and in the
administration,” she said.

She received her bachelor's
degree in social work from the
Carnegie Institute of Technology.
She went on to Pitt to get master’s
degrees and a doctorate in social
work.

“From way, way back I wanted
to be a social worker because I
felt that we have many obligations
to help people live fulfilling lives,”
she said.

She graduated from Pitt with
her first master’s degree in the
midst Of\‘(/orld War II. One of her
first accomplishments was
helping 175 young Jewish men
who survived the Nazi

man yelled. Freind (R.-Delaware
County) is running in this spring’s
Republican primary for the U.S.
Senate.

When asked ifhe thought such
demonstrations were helpful in
deterring abortions, Friend said,
“I know hundreds of occasions
when one of our people would
begin to talk to a woman and she
would  make a decision not to
have the abortion  Everybody
knows the babies are victims of
abortion. But in every abortion
there’s at least two victims, the
baby and the mother.

“You judge the worth of a
society about how it treats its
weakest, and of course in our
society who is the very weakest?
’I'hose who as of yet have no
voice and can't speak for
themselves."

Freind said he supported
health-care reform for lower-
income and single mothers, but
“national health care is not the
route to go because we’re talking
socialized medicine, where we
all lose.”

He alsocommented on the
peaceful demonstration. “’l'his is
extremely impressive, and it’s a
credit to both sides and a credit to
the professionalism ofthe police.

The beauty of this nation is it
always shows it’s big enough and
strong enough to deal with all
types of issues.”

Linda Wirfel, the president of
the pro—life group at St. Vincent’s
College, said, “We're just trying
to be a visible sign that respect
for life covers all. I'd like to see
them come over here,” she said
of the pro—choice escorts. “I don’t
think they realize what they’re
doing. I don’t think they realize
that two people go in the clinic
and only one goes out.”

Cassi Geier of PSfP said, “I’m
here today because these people
[pro-life marchersl annoy me. I’ve
been [an escort] for several years
now, and I feel great gratification
when a woman thanks me.”

Gina Menendez—McFarlin, co-
president of Pitt’s Campus
Women’s Organization, stood
across the street from Women’s
Health Services with escorts to
show her support for the clinic.

‘‘I’m here because I don’t think
a woman’s rights are any less
than the rights ofa fetus. I believe
it's fascist to impose your own
moral and ethical values on other
people. 'l'hat’s what I-litler did,”

Mcl"arlin said. Several other CWO ’

and Pittsburgh Students for Peace
attended the rally, along with
University Democrat Edith
Wilson.

Mary Litman, director of
education’ and public affairs said,
“lEscortsl come from all walks of
life. Women have the right to
enter the clinic with as much
dignity as they can. [Escorts] try
to alleviate harassment and serve
as peacemakers.”

In response to the protesters,
Litman said, “Incident reports

prove harassment bothers
lpatientsl emotionally. lPro-life
activists] say they care about
women. They don’t really care
about women.”

She said pro—life activists
“invaded the clinic with buckets
of tar” several years ago‘, but
“they’ve never closed us down.
We’re really committed to offering
a place where women can
exercise their options:
parenthood, adoption or abortion.
We feel as much joy when a
woman decides it is appropriate
for here to keep the child,” she
said.

Women's Health Services
displayed a sign which read
“Thank You Escorts” from its third-
floor window.

Tim Burns, Stephen Freind’s
campaign manager at St. Vincent’s
College, said he was there “to
protect unborn children and
campaign for‘ Steve Freind.”

When asked how he felt about
the escorts, Burns replied,
“Escorting, well, we have to pray
for them, that's for sure. Their
values and priorities need to be
redirected somehow. Before jobs
and national health care, we can't
do any of that until there is respect
for the unborn. Look how many
pro-lifers are here, and look how
many paid pro-abortionists are
here. I’ve yet to be at a pro—life
rally where we were
outnumbered.”

Carol Silvestre said she started
the escort program in 1989 after
pro—life protesters repeatedly
blocked the entrance to the clinic
until police came. Silvestre said
all escorts are volunteers who
have been trained to help the
women enter the building. “You
couldn’t pay me enough to do
this,” joked an escort.

“I do it because I’m a nice
person.”

Chris Landau, age 13, came to
the pro—life rally with his father
Rich.

Chrissaid he was there “to stop
abortion because it's killing. And
the Constitution says you can't
kill and stuff.” He added that the
pro—choice escorts “need to be
prayed for.”

 Language lab provides and

By Christine Hanna
Staff‘ Writer

Despite the benefits of a
language lab equipped with
headsets, tape recorders and
computers with instructional
software, few students attend the
lab regularly.

Over 50 languages, including
English, are on tape at Pitt’s
language lab for students to learn
comprehension, pronunciation
and grammar skills.

According to language-lab
statistics, 5,540 students attended
the language lab in September.
Most students were studying
English as a second language,
Spanish, and French.

Lab manager David Malicki said
attendance is usually high at the
beginning of the semester In
October 1991 attendance dropped
by 1,000 from the previous month.

The lab also duplicates tapes
for students who wish to study
elsewhere. Malicki said 683 tapes
were made in September 199],

2'0 aid to students

while 276 were made the next
month.

Audio and video recordings
can be broadcast from the lab
console by instructors for classes.
This allows the professors to
monitor the students and to
communicate with them individ-
ually or as a class, Malicki said.

Former language—lab director
Robert Henderson said the lab is
beneficial because students can
listen to native speakers in a
realistic context.

“The Istudentsl who proﬁt most
from the lab arestudents taking
Japanese, Arabic and languages
with pronunciations quite
different from English,"
Henderson said.

The lab also allows students to
tape their voices so they can
compare their voices with those
of the native speakers.

Henderson said isolation in
booths is a benefit of the lab.
“You can speak out loud without
looking like a fool, and you can’t
drill at home like you can here.”

More than a party

We all want to have a good time. President (or Chancellor,

‘ as it will be) J. Dennis O’Connor’s installation begs the

question, “How much are we willing to pay for party time?”

At a time when the university will lose an estimated $5.9
million from state appropriations, Pitt officials have had a
hard time eliciting sympathy for the $92,550 shindig.

Reactions have been strong. Gov. -Robert Casey was
ready to comment. “In preparingmy budget this year, I had
to make some very tough choices  I would encourage
you to follow the same,” Casey said.

Less hospitable was Auditor General Barbara Hafer. She
said, “That this sort of outlay should come at the heels of
[O’Connor’sl own public warning about a possible tuition
increase strikes me as particularly offensive.”

In response to criticism, university spokesperson Tim
Ziakus assured the uneasy that the costs come from
“unrestricted income from private sources.”

When tuition increases this year, it is doubtful that the
university will find some “unrestricted income” to bail out
students. ’

However when comparing other universities’
installments, Pitt is far more generous with excess. In 1988,

Duquesne University installed its president for $515,897,

according to The Pittsba rgh Post-Gazette. Carnegie Mellon
and Penn State University declined expensive installments.

While we all wish O’Connor a happy tenure here at Pitt,
we call into question the reality of such a hefty expenditure
during tight fiscal times in the interests of students.

The budget for the Academic » Symposia . clocks in at
$14,1 10. This event is open to the entire university
community. While it may be a nice idea, the thought of
increasing tuition would cast a pall over the event. Spending
$27,000 on a dinner for 350 cannot be excused.

Ultimately, Chancellor O’Connor will have to live with
the party’s consequences. Resentment among students
and the state legislature should not be the end result of a
supposedly joyous event. .

For many reasons, we cannot-see the advantage to th
university or to O’Connor by having this installation.

Rather than asking if Pitt should axe the dinner or keep
the installation ceremony, it would be in everyone’s best

‘ interests if the event were not to occur at all. As the saying
. goes, “If you can’t do it right, then don’t do it at all.”

In better economic times, these expenditures would not
have raised a brow. The university’s credibility will suffer
because the installation is happening in bad economic
times. .

‘Former President Wesley Posvar made his grandiose exit
with an open reception. Mushroom caps, domestic cheeses
and punch highlighted the event in the William Pitt Union
Ballroom. It may not have been the most elegant reception,
but it was the most sound budgetary decision made in
some time at this university.  ’

What a drag it is getting old.

Well, I turned 22 last month,
and God do I feel old. I can’t
understand it. All I want to do is
sleep all day, go to bed early and
wake up early. It makes no sense
at all. Just six weeks ago, when I
was still the ripe young age of 21,
I would go out until 4 a_.m., come
home, sleep ‘til noon, and I was
rip-roarin’ to go until-the next
morning. It has been that way
until now. _ _

I used to make fun of my
roommate about how old he is
(he’s 24), and he has nothing to

look forward to but death. Now E

I’m in that boat, too. Heed these
words, my younger friends.
, When you turn 22, it’s all

downhill from there. Birthdays
mean absolutely nothing. Going _

to bars is monotonous. Staying
out late is no big deal, and getting
drunk means nothing less than a
horrid hangover. I really feel for
those of you who-are over 30.
You must have it twice as bad.
And you 40-year-olds. Forget it.

What is really bad is that you
hear songs played at bars or on
the radio, and you hear yourself
(and friends) say, “Ah, yeah. I
remember that song when I was
way back in high school.”

Hell, high school was only four
years ago! But the worst thing
about that whole deal is people
making fun of your age and the
things you do.

Picture this. You’re in one of
the local taverns (that's what we
used to call them in the olden
days), and some little first-year

get two
weekend
victories,
impro 2/e
to 5]

By Jeremy Swarbrick
Staff Writer

The Pitt men's gymnastics
team improved its record to
5-1 this past weekend with
victories against James
Madison University and
Radford College in a dual
meet on Saturday at Trees
Hall. The Panthers scored a
season-high 260.65 points to
capture first place, while
James Madison finished
second with a team score of
256.80 points. Radford came
in third, scoring 252.75
points.

'l'he Panthers were led by
l)ave llausmith and Stuart
Yoss, who finished first and
second, respectively, in all-
around competition with
totals of 53.95 and 52/().

“l am very pleased,” _Y_oss
said. ""l'his has been my best
meet yet, but we still have a
long way to go.”

In individual competition,
Bausmith finished first on
thepommel horse (9. 15) and
the high bar (940). He also
placed second in the floor
exercises, scoring 9.10 points
and third in the vault with
8.85. Bausmith said he was
pleased with the team’s
victory, but he noted that the
team could have performed
a little better.

“We have been trying to
score 260, but we haven't
been able to. But we could
have given the meet away
with little mistakes," he
added.

Pitt’s Kyle MacBeth also
performed very well, placing
first on the parallel bars with
9.0() points and coming in
third in the floor exercises
(9.05) and the high bar (9.05).
MacBeth said he was fairly
happy with his performance
but added that the team is
going to work a little more in
practice.

Damon l)iFabio also
placed for Pitt, earning a
second place on the high
bar (9.10), an event that Pitt
performed very well in.

Head coach Frank
D’Amico said he was pleased
with the team's win but was
unsettled by it’s .inability to
put the meet away before
the last event. Pitt, plagued

by injuries and lack of depth, ,

was hampered with small
mistakes that left the door
open for a loss.

sends Pitt reeling, 79-59

 By Cory Walborn

Stajf Writer

Chestnut Hill, Mass. -9 It was a cold and snowy
night in Boston. Inside the Silvio O. Conte Forum,

" V however, the Boston College basketball team was

hot — red hot. Meanwhile the Pitt basketball team
was as cold as the weather outside.
The Eagles’ heat was ignited by their sparkplug

 guard, sophomore, Malcolm Huckaby. Huckaby’s

21 points and four assists led Boston College to a
surprisingly easy win over the Panthers, 79-59,
snapping Pitt’s three—game winning streak.

“Boston College did everything you do right,” Pitt
head coach Paul Evans said, “and we did whatever
you do wrong.”

Evans was right about that. He watched the
Eagles pass well, shoot well and play aggressive
defense while he had to bear witness to his
Panthers’ errant passing, erratic shooting and
stumbling defense.

Besides Huckaby’s outstanding play, fellow guard
Howard Eisley scored 20 points, 16 in the second
half. He canned two big three—pointers. This
backcourt tandem drove the lane — sometimes
passing, sometimes shooting — always making
something happen.

“We had to spread [Pitt?sl defense out and take
advantage of the quickness we have in our
backcourt, ” Boston College head coach Jim O’Brien
said. That happened, and it allowed 6-foot, 9-inch
sophomore Bill Curley and first-year player Mark
Molinsky to make their presences felt. Curley had
11 points and seven rebounds, while Molinsky was
deadly from outside the paint with 10 points.

All these heroics started from the onset of the
game’. “We got out of the blocks real well tonight,”
O’Brien said,gnoting his team’s fast start. Boston,
College led 4-3 with two minutes gone in the first
half, and they never looked back. '

For the Panthers,‘ the highlights of the night were
Sean Miller's back—to—back three—pointers early in

_the game. After those buckets it was all downhill.

Using Huckaby’s and Eisley’s quickness and
ability to drive the lane, Boston College held a 10-
point lead midway through the first half.

Pitt was able to cut that lead to three by going
inside to senior center Darren Morningstar and
junior forward Chris McNeal. But the Panthers still
trailed by five at the half, 35-30.

The second half started with Pitt scoring first,
then skidding to an abrupt halt. ‘Boston College
promptly ran off a seven—point scoring streak and
held a 42-32 lead. The Panthers again went inside,‘
this time to sophomore center Eric Mobley. Mobley’s
inside game, however, did not ease the pain or stop
Pitt’s skid. '

Two out of three

Wrestlers beat Drexel, Cal; lose to Lehigh

By Rob Pugliese
Senior Sports Writer

The Pitt wrestling team took
two of three matches in a tri—meet
at Lehigh University on Saturday.
Pitt pasted Drexel University, 34-
9, and California University of
Pennsylvania, 30-8, before losing
a heartbreaker to Lehigh, 23-19.
The Panthers could have walked
away with three victories, but a
golden opportunity against
Lehigh slipped away.

"I thought we wrestled pretty
good. We lost it on one fatal
mistake, and it was Perry Miller,”
Pitt head coach Rande Stottlemyer
said. ‘‘He’s come through for us
all year, and he just didn’t do
what he was supposed to do in
that-match. It was a tough loss.

There _were some guys that could
have done more, but it's just one
of those things that happens.”

An injury to Mike Porter forced
Stottlemyer to juggle his lineup
for the Lehigh matchup. Shawn
Hoover moved into the lineup at
the 150—pound weight class, and
Joe Plouse moved up from 150 to
158.

“Having to juggle our lineup
hurt us a lot,” Stottlemyer said.
“There were only two swing
matches against Lehigh; they were
at 134 and at heavyweight, and
we lost them.”

With Lehigh leading the
Panthers by only a 20-19 margin
preceding the heavyweight
matchup, the victory seemed to
be the Panthers’.

Miller pulled the Panthers

through in countless other dual
meets, most recently a week
earlier against Bloomsburg.

But there was no late magic in
this bout. Miller lost his grasp of
victory by giving up a takedown
with only :23 remaining in the
bout, falling 54. It was only the
second defeat of the season for
Miller.

“It sucked to lose," Miller said.
“You just feel like putting the
whole world on rewind and doing
it all over because you know you
can win. I just made one mistake,
and it cost me the whole match.
My guard was down — he did
what he had to do instead of me
doing what I had to do. It's
definitely a good lesson for me to
learn.”

“We had . exactly what .we.

wanted,” Stottlemyer said. “I
would have bet the ranch on it.
He didn’t wrestle very well, and
as a result he didn’t win. You
don’t want to be angry or upset
with him. For us to win, our
seniors have to win. If those guys
don’t win, we’re not gonna win.
But you don’t want to diminish
what he's done.”

Miller has plenty of motivation
staring him in the face, with
Clarion’s Kurt Angle coming to
Fitzgerald Field House on Friday
night. '

Angle is 17-0, ranked No. 1 in
the nation at heavyweight. The
two met at the Eastern Wrestling
League Tournament last March,
with Angle surviving on a 2-1,
sudden-death overtime decision.

Balls blitzea by expansion
Banaits in lacrosse action

 

By Jeremy Swarbrick
Staff Writer

As cold as the temperature was
Saturday night, the Pittsburgh
Bulls were even colder, giving up
15 goals in the second and third
periods en route to a 23-13
spanking from their division rivals,
the Buffalo Bandits.

The Bandits (1-5) are a newly
formed expansion team, and their
victory over the Bulls (1-3) was
their first-ever Major Indoor
Lacrosse League win. It also
dropped the Bulls into a last-
place tie with‘ Buffalo and
seriously hampered the Bulls’ try
for a division title and a berth in

the playoffs.

Just about the only things the
Bulls could start, were ﬁghts,
which they did in the third period.
Bulls forward Randy Ernst
charged at the Bandits’ goalie,
Bill Gerrie, and touched off brawl
No. 1.

Brawl No. 2 started just 10
seconds later, when Bandit Darris
Kilgour retaliated for the attack
on his goalie with a blow to the
face of Pittsburgh’s Ed
Stephenson. Kilgour was ejected
from the game for accumulating
over 10 penalty minutes during
the evening.

The action continued later,
when Bulls backup goalie Kevin

Bilger slashed a Bandit on the
head with his stick: His slash
resulted in a penalty shot, which
allowed the Bandits to score their
17th goal.

“The guys get frustrated. They
do things like that,” Bulls head
coach Dennis Wey said.

The Bulls opened the game by
giving up an early goal, but they
came back to take a 5-4 lead in
the second period. It all fell apart
for the Bulls then.

The Bandits consistently beat
the Bulls with fast breaks, leaving
goalie Bob Heyes on his own.

‘ The Bulls also surrendered four

Kings beat Pens for 10th road win

By Joseph J. Reif, Jr.
For The Pitt News

The Los Angeles Kings skated
into town Saturday and left with
a 4-5 victory. It was their 10th
road win of the year, and two of
them have come at the expense
of the defending Stanley Cup
champs.

At least_ the outcome of this
game was in doubt until the final
"minute.

Luc Robitaille dashed the Pens’

desire for a point at home (a rare
occurrence as of late), when he
turned deficient defense into the
decisive goal, depositing the puck
behind a distIaughtTom Barrasso.
If only the Penguins had as much
“D” as this sentence.

The Pens are now 1-4-1 in their
last six games and 1-5-1 in their
last seven home games.

The game began on a positive
note for the Pens, as they took an
early lead on Peter T aglianetti’s
first goal of the year (discounting

the one into his own net
Wednesday against the Rangers).
He took a drop pass from
rejuvenated Bryan T rottier and
fluttered a wrist shot past partially
screened goalie Kelley Hrudey.

Aside from that goal, territorial
play and execution belonged to
the Kings.

It was obvious that their game
plan was to gain the red line,
slam the puck hard off the boards
and pick up the carom along the

Bulls

Continued from page 11
who were supported by excellent
defensive play. The Bandits’
defense kept the Bulls away from
their net, forcing the Bulls to
shoot from the perimeter. Once a
save was made, the Bandits
looked for the break.

“We were shooting too much
from the perimeter. When you
do that, the goalie is going to be
able to control the ball and start
the offense,” Wey Said.

Wey said the team was not
mentally prepared for the game
and they tried to reorganize at the
half to no avail. ’

“I could sense in the locker
room that we were not ready to
play,” he said. “We talked about
getting back and playing defense

at the half, but we couldn’t get
back.”

The Bandits were led in the
scoring column by Derek Keenan,
who tallied five goals and three
assists.Game MVP Jim Veltman
scored five goals and added two
assists. The Bulls were led by
forward Butch Marino, who had
three goals and four assists.

The Bulls’ next home game is
scheduled for Saturday, Feb. 29
at 8 p.m. at the Civic Arena
against the Boston Blazers.

Wey said the team must regroup
and start over again at practice
this week. ,

“We only practice once a week,
but we are going to get a lot of
running done on Wednesday,”
Wey said.

Pens

opposite side. It worked.

Having the Great One didn’t
hurt either, and the rest of the
period evolved into Wayne’s
World. (Sorry.)

Gretzky scored a power-play
goal when he redirected a pass
from former Pen Marty McSorley.
He tallied again less than six
minutes later, tucking a give-
and—go'pass from Jarri Kurri into
a gaping net.

Barrasso was helpless on both
goals. He had to stand on his
head to keep the deficit at one.

Mark Recchi pulled the Pens
even when he jammed a power-
play goal upstairs on Hrudey. It
was Recchi’s 33rd goal of the
season, and it came after a nice
play by Kevin Stevens to keep
the puck in the zone.

Marty McSorley and Phil
Bourque traded goals in the third
period to knot the score at three.
McSorley got help on the play
when Robitaille’s wrap—around
attempt came out to him at the
circle. McSorley made no mistake
about it. It was his sixth goal of
the year.

Bourque was aided by the
replay official. After a lengthy
review, he ruled that Bourque’s
shot had eluded Hrudey and
crossed the goal line.

It stayed that way until the
puck popped onto lonely
Robitaille’s stick in the slot.

The fat lady was clearing her
throat shortly thereafter.

ICINGS —— If the Pens are to get
out of their current funk, Ron
Francis must contribute more
offensively.

Acquired late last year for his

commitment to defense, Francis,

has rarely ﬂashed the form that
made him the leading scorer in
the Hartford Whaler franchise’s
history. A

Now, in the absence of Mario
Lemieux, Paul Coffey andjaromir
Jagr, Francis contributes little
more than a back check. If this
continues, team owner Howard
Baldwin should request that he
give his check back. His
paycheck, that is —— the one that
caused him to miss training camp
and the first part of the season
while he waited for the deal he

Senior Sports Writer

After a close first half, Villanova
ran away from the Pitt women’s
basketball team Saturday for a
66-54 win.

The loss dropped the Lady
Panthers’ record to 8-13 overall,
5-7 in the Big East.

The Wildcats actually pulled
out to a big lead early on. A layup
by Villanova’s top scorer, junior
Nikki Benedix, gave Villanova its

largest margin at 18-6 with 12:05 A

remaining in the half. Benedix
scored 12 of those 18 points on
the way to a 31-point game. The
6-foot guard shot 15 for 17 from

the floor and grabbed 13

rebounds.’

Pitt’s starting backcourt had a
nightmarish game at both ends.
In addition to trying to stop
Benedix on one end, Pitt guards
Carol Morton and Erin Maloy

' were scoreless. Maloy went 0 for

9 from the ﬂoor.

“If someone told me before the
game that Erin Maloy would have
gone 0 for 9 for the game, ‘I

wouldn’t have believed them,”

’ Pitt head coach Kirk Bruce said.

“That is going ‘to happen
sometimes. We did get a good
game from Jill McElhinny. She
has played well the last two
games. She’s playing with a lot
more confidence.”

McElhinny had 14 points and
seven rebounds. She entered the
game just before Villanova
stretched the lead to 12, and a
minute later Pitt began to come
back. The Lady Panthers got close
with a six—point run, which made
the score l9~14 with 8:49 left.
Consecutive jumpers by Jonna
I-luemrich brought Pitt within one,
27-26, at the half.

‘‘I thought we played a pretty.

good first half,” Bruce said. “We
were only down by one. In the
second half, we were just missing
shots. We also didn’t rebound
well; they got too many second
shots.”

The Wildcats quickly extended
their lead in the second half. A
three—pOint play by Benedix
capped a 19'§ run to start the half
and run the score to 46-32. The

            A   13
to loana’ Laaly Pantloers 66-54 loss

closest Pitt got was within seven; f

on consecutive baskets by
Huemrich with 5:34 left in the

game. First—year guard Michelle P

Thornton responded with a three-

 

pointer for Villanova.Thatbegan _ 

a nirie-point Wildcat run that put
the game away. A
Villanova hit -49.1 percent of its

 

shots, compared to only 36.4 for ' '3

Pitt. The Wildcats also dominated

the boards, grabbing 44 rebounds ‘ 

to the Lady Panthers’ 35.
Huemrich led Pitt with 18 points

and seven rebounds. The restof ; A

the starters combined for only 12
points, eight by forward Jill
Colabrese.

In addition to Benedix’s.big
afternoon, center Rosemary

Magarity had nine points‘ and’

forward Mary Beth Tukis had six
points, eight boards and six assists.
The game left Bruce

considering lineup changes. One ’ J

possibility is returning McElhinny
to the starting lineup. '

“I’m considering it, but she just ‘

gives us a great spark off the
bench. I haven't decided about.

 total this year. It is optimistic, but
 - » we are fighting injuries,” hesaid.”

D’Amico has been trying to
raise the level of difficulty on
some of the routines, but he said
he is concerned for the health of
his athletes. He said the rash of
I _ injuries that the team incurred so
’ early in the season has depleted
his reserves. D’Amico said he
does not wantto put the health of
any of the gymnasts at risk.

‘‘I could push to raise the
, difficulties of the routines, but
we could lose some of the guys
to injury. I could see in the parallel
bars that we were under pressure.
Once someone begins to fall, it
becomes infectious.”

Pitt’s next meet is Saturday at 1
p.m. against Kent State at Trees
Hall. D’Amico noted that Kent
has a 260-plus team and that the
Panthers will have to clean up
V their routines this week and
improve on the parallel bars and
I the rings if they are to win.

“Even if] lower the difficulties
of the routines, I just want them
to be clean,” he said.

Game

Continued from page 10

Watching the Eagles roll
off two more seven-point
scoring sprees, the Panthers
saw the lead swell to 27
points. Only a late Miller
three-pointer helped bring
the final margin of defeat
down to 20 points.

Pitt was led by Mobley’s
12 points and eight
rebounds, followed by
Mi1ler’s 11 points and
Morningstar’s nine.

Meanwhile ‘Boston
College, a good shooting
team, was at the top of its
game. In the second half the
Eagles’ ﬁeld-goal percentage
was 59 percent, and they
sank five of seven from
three-point land in the ﬁnal
20 minutes.

“Our intensity level
improved since our last
game,” O’Brien said. “That
intensity was the key.”

With that improving
intensity, the Eagles
improved their ‘Big East
record to 5-6 (13—7 overall).
This win snapped their six-
garne losing streak against
Pitt, which dated all the way
back to 1989. '

“Everybody was out of
it,” Evans said about his
team’s performance. “In the
second half’ we got out of
synch totally and didn’teven
go inside.” Evans said he

I knew Boston College had
something to do with Pitt’s
' disappointing effort.

“Boston College has great .-
talent, ” Evans said. ‘‘All they
lacked last year was
confidence, and now they
have it.”' I

The question now turns‘
to the Panthers, a team that
sits in the middle of a
jumbled Big East conference
with a 6-4 record (14-9
overall). Can Pitt sustain the I
needed confidence to make
a run at the Big East crown?

I That answer awaits, as
the Panthers take on a hot-
and—cold_ Villanova team
tonight at the Fitzgerald
Fieldhouse’.

Continued from page 13
that yet,” Bruce said. “We’re toying
with the idea of a more offensive
lineup. Even in the game we won
(a 58-53 victory over Syracuse
last Wednesday), we struggled
offensively.”

Pitt will have to do it soon, as
the Panthers travel to Miami
Tuesday night. The Hurricanes
have won 19 in a row through
Saturday, bringing their record to
19—1. Miami beat the Lady
Panthers 75-S4 earlier this season
at Fitzgerald Field House.

Senior forward Frances Savage
steamrolled her way to 27 points,
mostly inside, last time. She
averages 21.8 points per game.

“Last time we got behind and
had to go to a man-to-man

IdefenseI,” Bruce said. “You can’t .

stop her. This time we probably
won't play man. We’ll use some
kind of zone and collapse in. She
can score from the outside, but
she won't rebound out there.”
