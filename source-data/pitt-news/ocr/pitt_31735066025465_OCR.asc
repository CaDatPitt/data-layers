need of new blood

Page 7

Students held posters and signed petitions
Wednesday _in front of the William Pitt Union
protesting The Pitt News for publishing a sex-

’ ual assault victim’s name.

About 20 people attended the demonstra-

tion, but the people handing out petitions
9 said that they did not know who organized
the protest.

Though the purpose was to protest the
reporting of a sexual assault victim’s name,
the participants in the rally were bothered by
other aspects of the article.

Nathan Miller said that he was concerned
about the writer’s judgement regarding the
choice of language in the news article. He
said including details like”tickling her butt and
legs” was outrageous.

“What kind of editorial board do we have?”

he said.

Former news editor, Julie Sabol, responded
to the protesters comments about the way that
the story “was handled by The Pitt News staff.

“I resigned from the paper, so I am not
involved right now. Ileft because of ideologi-
cal differences with the editor-in—chief. I
understand the anger of the protesters, and I
am taking the issue very seriously. The name
of the victim was not put in the paper inten-
tionally or with any malicious will,” Sabol

said.

Students Amee Campbell and Jill Gaines
were also unhappy with the coverage of the
story. '

Campbell said that she participated in the
demonstration because she wanted to show
that she thinks protecting the identity of the
victim is important.

“You would have to live in a cage tonot
know this policy,” Gaines said.

Student Government Board member Jacob
Brody, criticized the retraction»The Pitt News
printed on Monday.

“It was the biggest bullshit apology I have
ever heard in my life,” Brody said.

Sports editor Jim Lakely, one of several Pitt
News staff members present at the protest,
said, “We are not trying to ﬂuff it off and let it
roll off our backs. We share the outrage of the.
rest of the university community. We are out
here because we care. It matters.”

Brody later said, “I know you feel bad about
it, but the rest of the student body does not
know. Now we’re hearing it, and now we
understand.”

Editor—in-chief Jason Hillman said, “I want to
apologize to my staff for not being [at the
protest], I don’t have a legitimate reason for
not being there.”

GSPH reorganizing
its offered majors  

By Beth Kovaly
Staff‘ Writer

After 55 years, the Graduate
School of Public Health is reor-
ganizing its offered majors.

The school proposes to elimi-
nate two degrees ——- the master
of science in hygiene would
change to simply a master of
science, and the doctor of sci-
ence in hygiene would become
a Ph.D.

GSPH Associate Dean Edgar
Duncan said it is a change that
is long overdue and one that
the school has been gearing to
for some time.

“At one time we did have a
different set of requirements for
the master of science and the
master of science in hygiene,”
Duncan said. “Then we said,
‘this is the school of public
health, everybody should have
the same core of knowledge.
We set up the core courses so
that you have the common
knowledge no matter what
course you’re 

Duncan said that Pitt is out-

dated by still having the.

hygiene degrees, and that it
causes confusion for Pitt health
school graduates.

“People who have the degree
have had a real problem
explaining to people outside of

« Pittsburgh about that degree,”

Duncan said. “There is no field

called ‘hygiene’. There are
some legitimate fields, such as
industrial hygiene, but none
called ‘hygiene’.”

In 1955, the GSPA added the
hygiene degrees to its main
areas of offered degrees: a mas-
ter of public health, doctor of
public health and a master of
science. Duncan said the main
difference between a master of
science degree in hygiene and
simply a master of science was
in the experience requirement.
At the time, the master of sci-
ence required three years of
health experience, while the
hygiene degree did not.

The official move for change
came in 1989, when one of the
school’s programs proposed to
convert the doctor in hygiene
to a Ph.D. Duncan said other
schools had long since been
without ‘in hygiene.’

“Everyone had dropped the
awarding of the ‘in hygiene’
degrees except us,” he said.

“What a lot of [Pitt] graduates
have done is simply drop it,

they just refer to themselves as
a master of science, or doctor
of science. People understand
[those degrees]. They might ask
you what it’s in, but they don’t
have trouble understanding
what the degree represents,”
Duncan said.

Earning credits overseas
becomes a reality for many

By Matt Groff
For the Pitt News

A semester spent studying in
Europe, Asia or South America
may sound too good to be true
to many Pitt students, but
according to Study Abroad
Advisor Betsy Weaver, studying
in another country is not only
possible, it is also practical.

“First and foremost, only 4
percent of those in the job mar-
ket have studied in other coun-
tries,” Weaver said at a Study
Abroad information session
Wednesday. “People who have
experienced studying abroad
are in a fantastic position over
those with whom they com-
pete.

“Students with international
experience are highly regarded
by employers who recognize
the initiative and self-confi-
dence it takes to study abroad.”

Weaver said that many of the

I programs sponsored or affiliat-

ed with Pitt cost a little more
than Pitt’s in-state tuition. In
addition, any financial aid
received by a student is applic-
able toward study abroad.

Pitt accepts credits from most
programs, and in pre-approved
cases, accepts credits toward
one’s major.

“Many students don’t realize
how practical foreign study can
be,” Weaver said.

Several students returning
from foreign study were pre-
sent at the session, relating sto-
ries of the academic and social
cultures of other countries.

Rebecca ~Weitz spent six
months at Hebrew University in
Jerusalem.

“I was able to take classes
not offered anywhere else,”
Weitz said. “For example, one
class I had was ‘Historical
Tours of Jerusalem.’ We simply
walked around Jerusalem learn-
ing about the different sites.”

Staci Safady, who studied at V

nearby Tel Aviv University said,
“I think the most valuable part
of studying abroad is being
able to immediately use what
you learn. I came out of my
language class each day trying

out new words and listening to J

find what I could understand.”
Students also told of various

GSPH

Continued from page 1

The GSPH is currently going
through the university’s process
to change a degree and has set
forth three main plans for the
program change in dealing
with past, present and future
students.

Any new students entering
the school will only be enrolled
in either the public health or
science fields. There will not be
any ‘in hygiene’ option.

“We’re notifying them as they
apply for admission what
the offerings are. As far as I
know no one is insisting on
keeping that degree,” Duncan
said.

Current students in the field
can continue with the ‘in

- hygiene‘ degree if they chose

to, but Duncan said he can’t

’ think of any reason they -would

want to do so. “I think when

I people have to stop and won-

derabout a degree, it puts
them at a disadvantage.”

The third group affected by
the change will be alumni

' already possessing the f ‘in

hygiene’ degree. Duncan said

proposal where the alumni
could be given a new diploma
if they meet the academic
for
degree in the public health
field.

“What we’d have is probably
a happier set of alumni who
don’t have to explain why
[their] degree is different from
all other degrees,” Duncan said.

The adminis.tration has
approved eliminating the mas-
ters of science in hygiene
degree, but Duncan said they
are having some problem con-
verting the doctor of science in
hygiene to a Ph.D. The ques-
tion Duncan said Pitt is asking
is whether as a public health

another?

Ph.D. can be equally compared . ‘

to other Ph.D. programs such
as chemistrygor physics._

What it comes down to,
Duncan said, is trying to simpli-
fy the internal requirements, to
make it easier on both students
and their advisors in the School
of Public Health. ,

think is solearth-shattering it is

“If a clinician comes up with some
new data on say, Alzheimer’s disease,
how can they get that data turned into

Starting in the late 1960s, there has
been a growing consumer advocacy

according to Hicks.

The movement is ‘mainly concerned
with patient rights and the ending of
abuses within the psychiatric health sys-

tem. In December, WPIC will sponsor a
conference,”Partnerships in Psychiatry,”
to celebrate over 20 years of this work.

In addition to professional conferences,
there are also going to be programs

After returning home once
more, Schwartz searched for a
teaching’ position at a college
or university. He visited sever-
al campuses before coming to
Pitt, which he liked instantly.

“And Pittsburgh is one of the
prettiest places. People who
have never been to Pittsburgh
imagine it to be dirty and
smelly, but it is really one of
the cleanest places. I really
love it here,” he said.

Schwartz teaches French IV,

The program he coordinates
between the universities gives
the students an opportunity to
communicate with other
French students using the
electronic mail system and
word processing skills. Many
of the students end up making
friends, as well as learning the
language, Schwartz said.

“It is very fulfilling. There
are great people applying to
the graduate program,” he
said, but added that his real
place is in the classroom.

“If I can spark an interest in
other students, then I’m
happy,” Schwartz said with a
smile.

“I like to have fun in class.
Fun and learning should go
together,” he said.

In the classroom students
speak only French. Schwartz
said he believes in integrating
all the language skills all of
the time.

According. to Schwartz, his
students respond eagerly to
this philosophy and reflect
that in their evaluations of
him. The evaluations matter,
he said, and he does mak"3-'

gramito fit the needs of his

“Many students think French
is a difficult language because
of the pronunciation, but that
and the grammar is easier to
learn compared to other lan-

He added that the English
language borrowed many

French words, so students .

The artful dodgers

Election 1992 is beginning to heat up, and each
week it is a new issue which takes priority. First it was
family values, then it was who most resembled the
characteristics of Harry S. Truman, and now it is about
the draft record of the candidates.

The military record of a presidential candidate is not
an issue to be taken lightly. The president of the
United States commands both the largest nuclear arse-
nal and armed forces in the world. And as the nation
that most of the world looks to for military protection,
the president commands more than a small amount of
respect. . .

Thus, one would think or as logical argument would
have it, that the most qualified person to act as com-
mander-in-chief would be one who has been in the
trenches.

George Bush has been there. Bill Clinton has not.
Bush was a decorated war hero and an accomplished

pilot, and the only plane that Clinton ever ﬂew on was .

the passenger airline to study at-Oxford University. We

are not saying that the fact that Bill Clinton did not

serve makes him any less qualified to be president. We
wonder why Bush and certain_ members of the media
have focused on this issue." i

President Bush served in a war‘ in which our national -

interests were directly in question. The Japanese had
bombed Pearl Harbor, and every young man
in America was lining up to fight for his country’s
ideals. Vietnam — however the times were different.
Vietnam was not a popular war, and whether or not
we actually belonged there is a question. that will be
debated forever.

‘Bush says his opponents military record raises ques-
tions about his ability to lead'Amen'ca. But like certain
members of the media, Bush too should remain out-
side of this issue. By criticizing Clinton, Bush is criticiz-
ing his vice president as well. Vietnam. was a different
type of conﬂict from any previous war.

History treats almost every war previous to Vietnam
definitively. That is to say, that our reasons for previ-
ous conﬂicts are easily understood. To criticize Quayle
and Clinton is to misunderstand the implications of this
war and the hardships so many faced.

Both Bill Clinton and Dan Quayle dodged theedraft I

— plain and simple. Quayle joined the National Guard
and Clinton flirted with ROTC. Perhaps the ability
to act as commander-in-chief is directly related to
the amount of military service one serves. Maybe it is
not. But during this time when the viability of the

candidates’ characters are being questioned we think,

this draft-dodging issue proves a lot. It proves that
these two men can be scared, and that, most irnpor—
tantly, they’re just like the rest of us.

The Pitt News in need

No, Your Eminence Hillman,
while you may certainly find
your abhorrent act brings you
consequence; it by no stretch,
affords you now, the luxuries
of papal robes of “accepting”
criticisms.

The entire university commu-
nity, as victims of this scandal
sheet, cries out against your
descending aversions, political
waverings and vile panderings.
We. seek justice, and your
hand, Sir, serves us bondage.

The high and mighty office-

of editor in chief reeks with the
stench of unaccountability and

disguised ignorance. What

might otherwise be lauded as
the indestructible truth in the
edicts of The Pitt News‘ guiding
principles, is, in the most dis-
gusting manner, flushed under
your stewardship.

Had I not the faith and
acknowledgement of futility, I
advise you, most

hammer-lock on the paper.

Step down, resign, exhibit
the willingness to place the
integrity of the newspaper
above your petty designs on a
pretty resume and future
employment. You might just
strike a blow.

A blow for a paper that is a
sterling example of profession-
alism to a young journalist, not
a small chain—styled ailing
paper mill. A blow for the
University of Pittsburgh with
students replete of character,
excellence and skill, not inepti-
tude. .

The Pitt News finds itself, with
this issue of editorial blindness,
overbearance and ignorance, in
a position to emerge cleansed
and renewed. Forget the mat-
ter, hide behind the skirts of
ambiguity of responsibility, and

thumb the obvious rage and
bury your paper in an icy
grave, Mr. Hillman.

Surely, the offices of The Pitt
News harbor a single soul able
and eager to purify what you
have soiled — the paper’s cred-
ibility.

With the very same horror,
you send readers recoiling from
your heinous crimes, a
supreme force is shaking, mov-

Powerlines not hazardous

We are living in the age of
ultra paranoia, to the extent
that we can no longer live in
this society without the doom-

sayers creating another nose ~

full of worry for the public to
sniff after. We’ve absorbed
them all from the mystical
swine flu epidemic which was
supposed to devastate civiliza-
tion in the early ‘70s, to the
unfounded claims that there
may be cancer possibilities
from drinking something as
wholesome as milk. The worry-
wart brigade is still wielding its
ugly head in 1992 by trying to
wrongly add Duquesne Light’s
new power line to its wall of
shame. These professional
antagonists have -used every

weapon in their fantasy arsenal
to tiy to disrupt a project which
will ultimately bring more rev-
enue and jobs to our area.
Though I believe that we
should be concerned with any
issues of health, it is not fair
that these anti-linees are trying
to give the public a false_sense
of panic by saying that the line
will take away from the envi-
ronment. This is far from the
truth and just down right fanat-
ic activism. My relatives and I

have been living under power -

lines all of our lives and we
have not suffered from any
health hazards that these band-
wagon occupants have been
hyped into believing. I just
hope and pray that we are not
left out in the cold when the
final decision for the power

line is levied and we’re on the A

outside looking in wondering
why our unemployment rate is
so staggering.

A new political party

I was glad to see the Sept. 22
article “Libertarian student
makes move into politics.”

To me, the Libertarian Party
is the only political party that

can fix this country. In
November, I am voting
Libertarian.

But right now, just as impor-
tant as getting votes, we also
need publicity. Most Americans
have never even heard of the
Libertarian Party. But, with the
help of articles like this one,
maybe that will change.

It’s 7:30 p.m. on a Friday night in
front of the Calvary United Methodist
Church. Wedding guests are congregat-
ing on the church steps while the ushers

tryto break down the door. Inside, the

mother of the bride searches the sanctu-
ary franticly for the bride’s-missing
shoes. The -wedding procession stops
halfway down the aisle because the
father of the bride’s cellular phone is
ringing. Is this the wedding from hell?
No, it’s_ Marry Mel, one of the newest
concepts in entertainment to hit
Pittsburgh in a long time.

Marry Me! is a piece of “interactive
theater,” which is to say that the audi-
ence is not passively watching a play
about a wedding gone mad but are the
actual guests. The actors portray the
wedding party and members of the fam-
ily and freely interact with the audi-
ence/guests. Members of Reality

The company does an excellent job of

creating the illusion that one is actually
attending a “real” wedding. They min-

this is “only a play”  except no wed-

Part of the strength of this production
is the constant element of surprise
throughout the evening. It is hard to
guess which‘ situations are scripted and
which are devised on the spot. The
director, Tamar Copeland, and design
team for this event have surpassed

"themselves in creating a believable

atmosphere for this comic wedding.
Every tacky little detail is perfect -
from the bridesmaid wearing a conven-
tional bra with a backless gown to the
red and white streamers and “Viva

for the reception. Nothing is spared

from this carefulattention to detail, and '

Upstairs Tloeater brings Prelude
to a Kiss to t/ye Pittsbargb stage

By Michelle Kleinsak
Staff Writer

What if you lived with the same per-
son everyday, thought you knew this
person and then one day realized you
were wrong all along? This is the sim-
ple premise for Craig Lucas’ play,
Prelude to a Kiss, a modern comedy
which the Upstairs Theater has revived
until Oct. 3.

The play opens with a party scene
where Molson-drinking, data analyst
Peter meets a fairly drunken, former
Socialist bartender named Rita. Sexual
attraction is apparent, and the two
become an item almost instantly. From
there, the play follows the progression
of the relationship into marriage. This
is where things start to get weird. An
old man at the ceremony gives the
bride a congratulatory kiss, and some-
how their souls are switched. It doesn’t
take long for Peter to figure out that
the Rita he married is not the same girl
he fell in love with. After a great deal
of chaos, and a subsequent breakdown
of the relationship, the souls are
restored to their proper owners and
everyone is all the better for having

learned some particular lesson in life.

The plot is predictable, and at times
full of sappy romanticism, yet it never
becomes sickeningly sweet, due to the
insights that surface during the play’s
dialogue. We see Rita’s cynicism about
child-rearing in a precarious world,
boldly proclaiming “Sex is a drug man-
ufactured by‘ the Bible to snare us all
into mating.” She tells Peter that it’s
difficult enough to grow up and face
the pressures that we’ve all dealt with,
much less to bring children into the
world who will have to deal with
someone trying to push crack on them
in the first grade. '

Rita’s not the only one who’s cyni-
cal, however. Taylor, the best man at
the wedding, has one of the best mar-
riage-phobic quotes in the play, keenly
pointing out that “marriage is just
another step in life, like sliding down a
bannister that turns into a razor blade.”
These little glimpses into realistic atti-
tudes balance out the “happily ever
after” concept. A lot of regret surfaces
in the second act through the character
of the old man. “What if I would’ve

. conducted my life differently?” seems

House Of Pain
Shamrocks and Shenanigans
Tommy Boy Records ~

What happens when a stiff, white rapper with a gel cut all
of ‘a sudden shaves his head, tattoos his body, pierces his
nostril and hooks up with one of the hypest Djs in hip—hop?

The House of Pain.

Remember Everlast from Ice-T’s Rhyme Syndicate, back in
1990? He couldn’t rhyme worth a damn, it seemed. (Ed.
Note: The beats were weak as well.) Well, he’s back with a
whole new crew and stronger concept on the Irish tip.
Everlast, Danny Boy O’Connor and D] Lethal churn out a
promising debut effort under‘ the brilliant production of D]
Muggs (Cypress Hill).

This Los Angeles crew loves corned beef and cabbage,
drinks Mickey’s and Guinness brew, smokes blunts and
talks a lot of smack (and I mean a lot). Everlast makes
strides — coming with a hardcore approach — but this
effort would be considerably weaker without the slick style
and mad skills of Danny Boy. S

The tone is set early with the slammin’ intro, “Salutations,”
where Everlast talks over a “House of Pain” loop. “Jump
Around” explodes with dense, dense beats, shrill
sirens/screams and a driving bass line. Like almost every cut
on the entire album, this track leans heavily on its chorus.
Everlast’s style bears no resemblance to his weak solo
record. He’s not only harder but also rougher.

Lovely Singles in rainy Seattle

By Brian Gallagher

Senior Staff Writer

These are a few of my
favorite things.

Busting on the X—man, ejacu-
lating Spain and noshing ‘bout
love to the grunge sounds of
the Emerald city.

Well  not exactly.

Actually, the aforementioned
selections of Xavier McDaniel
slammin’ false meat jackin’ and
yuppie yappin’ make for a tri-

fecta of light moment in Singles _

—— a two—hour snipet—fest of a
ﬂick that tracks the hearts of six
Seattle twenty-somethings in
search of love in all the maybe-

it’s-wrong-maybe-it’s-right
places.

Starring an ensemble cast of
upstart actors (Bridget Fonda,
Campbell Scott, Kyra Sedgwick
and Matt Dillon), this light-
hearted, reflecting-about-
romance movie strobelight-
spotlights a potpourri of angst-
ridden social situations between
males and females —- set to the
gruesome grunge-sounds of
local rockers Pearl jam, Alice in
Chains and Soundgarden.

It is the film indust1y’s ‘great-
est l1its—and—misses of love in
the ‘90s.

Written and directed by
Cameron Crowe — the Rolling

Stone mag grad and peachfuzz
flick whiz who delivered the
witty brainchild twins Say
Anything and Fast Times at
Ridgemont High in the ‘80s —

-the Seattle—saturated two—hour

movie intermittently focuses on
the lives of five friends who
live in the same apartment
Complex  along with another
mid-205 female living on her
own.

The film opens with one—on-

ters, who break the fourth wall

away from the reception. All of these
actors are masters of improvisation and car-
icature. Using a quick-thinking energy
which must be mentally exhausting, these
talented people fuel the illusion every
moment of the evening. Each person can-
tributes equally to the show’s success.

Shelly Yates is perfect as the self-
obsessed bride, Gloria Fantuzzo. David
Popelka matches her performance as an
equally narcissistic groom, Geno Corelli.
The drunken best man, Dominic Corelli
(splashily played by Tom Langdon) is coun-
tered by the icy Dena Fantuzzo (Christine
Elizabeth McBride), the maid of honor. The
crazy collection of relatives are highlighted
by Fabrizio as “G—Pa” Emilio Corelli, Maijie
Stewart as gossiping‘ Sophia and Dalel
Khalil as the clitzy Bambi. Special mention
should go to Maddy Gentile (Brenda
Ceglarski) and her show—stopping rendition
of “Do It To Me One More Time.”

event are not related to the company, but

to the reception. The pricey ticket promises
a “complete Italian buffet” and states there
will be a cash bar. Held in the banquet
room of the James Street Inn on the North
Side, -the food was less than expected ——
the main course consisted of rigatoni, garlic
bread and salad. As this is‘ a young compa-

ny puttingon a spectacular event, this
could be understood. However, the cash
bar’s prices were ridiculous. This is certain-
ly not cheap fun. -

Despite these problems, Marry Me!
remains well worth seeing as a unique
innovation in Pittsburgh entertainment.

(Sedgwick), a suffocating envi-
ronmentalist who works on
ways to keep the Paciﬁc Ocean
clean; Steve (Campbell Scott),
who lives for transportation
and has plans for a supertrain;
Janet (Bridget Fonda), an art-
student-to-be from Arizona
who works in a coffeesliop;
and Cliff (a campy Matt Dillon),
who sings and plays guitar in a

band called Citizen Dick.

Linda and Steve hook up at a
club, make love to the sounds
of the “My Three Sons” theme
and play indecisive couple;

’ Janet and Cliff get together

once — Janet thinking it’s for-
ever love . while Cliff is too
worried about people “touch-
ing his dick.”

They all have career prob-
lems and personal prob-
lems. Plus, there’s atmosphere
out the wazoo.

But it’s nothing more than
the same warn—tire storyline of
late -20s—early-30s niale—female

Night and He Said, She Said
swim-and-sink box office fod-
der —— except without any sus-
taining plotline material longer
than a music video.

Linda likes Scott but is

unsure. Scott is trying to play it
right, but doesn’t want to play
games. Janet wants someone
who says “bless you!”. Cliff
wants large breasts. It goes on
and on.

After individual soul search-
ing, contemplation and a con-
venient car wreck to solve a
story problem, there’s a tight,
sugar—coated ending that leaves
off where the film staited.

The idea of developing char-
acters doesn’t even venture in
Crowe’s formula — wasting the
decent on—screen efforts of the
young, talented cast.

As for the efforts of the afore-

mentioned cast, Campbell Scott
stands out as the lucky one of
the lot. His portrayal of Steve
thrives mostly due to the fact
that he gets more screentime

THE PTTI‘ NEWS, Thursday, September 24, 1992

 

Continued from page 9

“I’ll serve your ass like John McEnroe/ if
your girl steps up/ I’m smacking the ho/
word. to your moms/ I came to drop
bombs/ I got more rhymes than the Bible
got psalms.” This is a Celtic fest —- Everlast
and his boys stepping into a raucous Irish
pub, cracking open a few brews in a green
Bird jersey and raising hell. Everlast’s
nicest rhyme — “try to play me out like as
if my name was Sega.”

B-Real and Muggs take over “Put Your
Head Out,” a funky Cypress—esque jam
with saxophone and high-pitched fuzzy
noise loop. B-Real supplies his nasal tone,
smoking blunts and busting caps while
Everlast boasts “the luck of the Irish.”

One of the hardest tracks is “Top O’
The Morning To Ya” driven by a bumpin’
bass line and bluesy harmonica over some
more dense beats. The chorus is prominent
with DJ Lethal cutting it up over the har-
monica. “You see I’m Irish but I’m not
a leprachaun/ you wanna fight_/ then
step up and we’ll get it on/ you get a right“
to the grill/ I’m white and I ill/ a descen-
dant of Dublin with titanic skill,” Everlast
ﬂows.

“House and The Rising Sun” settles into
a catchy, laid back groove beneath a deep,
reverberating bass and squonky sax loop.
Everlast chants, “That’s_ what it is y’all,.
that’s what it is” on the chorus, and guest
SonDoobiest kicks definite Irish ﬂavor with
his funky accent. “Smoke like Beretta/
quicker than a Jetta’/ you’re soft like a
feather/ you little bed/-wetter.” The self-

 

proclaimed “Doobie-funk fel1o/ smooth
like jello” has one of the "hicest verses on
the album “cause I got the right one like
Ray Charles.”

The follow-up single to “Jump Around”
should be “Shamrocks And Shenanigans” a
smooth track jumpin’ off with a bluesy gui-

tar then settling into a groove — Danny .

Boy brings a different style, a nice contrast
to Everlast’s coarse delivery.

Everlast goes off early. ‘‘I kicks the flavor
like Stephen King writes horror/ If I was a
jew, then I’d-light a Menorah” and “I’m
quick on the draw like the horse named
McGraw from the cartoon — “boom shel-
1ack—lack boom” — the dominant repetitive
chorus. “The lyrical murderer,” Danny Boy
tears it up hard and gets respect while

‘Lethal demonstrates his skills on the turnta-

bles. Everlast boasts boldly, “Step up bold,
I’ll knock out your gold fronts” (though I
don’t think he’d spew that to my man Larry
Johnson).
Another dominant chanting chorus
drones, “the House of Pain is in effect y’all
.. and anyone that steps up is gettin
wrecked.” The bassy layered horns ‘com-
plement the high-pitched wail with
-Lethal cutting a “come into the house”
sample in and out between chorus and
verses.» ,

.. ‘- ‘The fatteilsltﬂtirlack beat-wise is undoubted-

ly “Danny Boy, Danny Boy,” a funky jam
packed with dense samples — ranging
from layers of different female vocals to
screaming to crowd noise, heavy drum
tracks, bouncy organ and Lethal’s simple

but effective cutting.

The soft, swirling, high-pitched
noise/siren loop and deep walking bass
line that exemplifies the Cypress Hill
sound dominates “Guess Who’s Back.” A
guitar weaves in and out, and the chorus
tells “he’s back” over a ﬂute—like loop and
more distorted guitar. “Put On Your Shit
Kickers” plods along over a heavy blasting
drum beat, a sporadic screaming loop and
syncopated piano sample. The track gradu-
ally crescendos into an Irish frenzy and
both MCs trade nice verses of which D.B.
takes the honors —— “Danny Boy’s coming
wit the Irish style/ the money-back guaran-
tee/ I make it worth your while/ I’m layin
out fools like kitchen tile.”

Psychedelic feedback, reverberating
deep bass, more wailing noise and distort-
ed horns compose a muddled, dense track
“Come And Get Some of This” —— that talks
more junk than L.T. in his prime. Listening
to this track, you’ll swear Muggs took it
straight from Cypress’ album.

“Life Goes On” is a violent Irish jig con-
cerning L.A. cops, with a sing-along cho-
rus. “One For The Road” is more of the
same hard-boasting over deep bass, “the
House of -Pain/ that’s the name of my
crew/you don’t like it/ tough luck/ what
the f—— ya gonna do.” Nothing.

V_ This album grows on you more and
more with each passing listen. the House

Of Pain not only talks the talk but also _-

walks the walk.

The Minnesota offense does not
boast an overwhelming collection
of weapons. But then again, neither
did Pitt’s previous three opponents,
and the Panthers had plenty of
problems against them.

First-year head coach Jim Wacker
said his Minnesota offense “kind of
sputtered and fluttered at times”
in last week’s loss to Colorado,
but he failed to mention they
rang up 452 yards and put up 20
points.

That is not the simplest of tasks
against the Buffalos, one of the
nation’s tougher defenses.In fact,
452 yards against the Buffs is down-

, right impressive.

Pitt struggled miserably on
offense when these teams_last
battled but held on for a 14-13
win at the Metrodome last
season.

Minnesota brings ‘sputter
ozndﬂiitter’ defense to Pitt

According to Pitt head coach Paul
Hackett, the Golden Gophers are a
much-improved team offensively.

The offense feeds off one man —
senior quarterback Marquel
Fleetwood. He’s not a vocal leader,
simply a man who gets the job
done.

In his third season at the helm,
Fleetwood has shown tremendous
progress.

A good athlete with a strong arm
and great quickness, Fleetwood
appears capable of presenting Pitt
with problems.

He leads the team in rushing with
178 yards on just 26 attempts (6.8
avg) and has completed 50 percent

of his passes" for 488 yards and two

scores.

8 The down side of Fleetwood’s

game has been interceptions. He
threw four against Colorado.

Losing six starters from a defensive
unit that led the Golden Gophers to a 2-
9 record in 1991, Minnesota’s anything-
but-vaunted defense could be the best
remedy for a Pitt offense known more
for failure than ﬂight in 1992.

In the first two weeks of the season,
the Gophers’ defense had yielded 60
points to high—ﬂying San Jose State and
a Colorado team playing without quar-
terback Cordell Stewart.

“We’re a young football team,” head
coach Jim Wacker said. “We only had
six starters back from 2-9 last year.

Their play in last week’s 21-20 loss to
ColoradoVUniversity was encouraging to
the first—year Golden Gophers’ coach.

“The biggest improvement probably
[came] in our linebacker play, particular-
ly Andy Veit,” Wacker said. “That was
encouraging [for our defense].”

The prospects of facing a running
game minus the services of Panthers’
tailback Curtis Martin _—— who will likely
miss the game with a bruised Achilles
tendon —*doesn’t make Wacker any
more confident in stopping Pitt’s ground
attack. Whether it’s Jermaine Williams,

Fleetwood
to run and
gun at Pitt

By Cory Walborn
Staff Writer

There are few bright spots on
Minnesota’s football team, blag,
there is, however, Marquel
Fleetwood, a true shining star.

The senior quarterback has
been the Gophers’ quiet leader
for the last three years. While
guiding his team, he has let his
actions speak for themselves.

“There are several ‘rah-rah’
type leaders and then there are
guys who lead by example, not
by words,” Fleetwood said. “I
am one of them.”

Fleetwood comes to Pitt
Stadium Saturday night hopirrgx’
his actions will be enough to
overcome a struggling Pitt
team.

“Our main focus is to run the
ball to open our passing
game,” Fleetwood said. “We
will have to make the big
plays.”

Making big plays is nothing
unusual for Fleetwood. As he
begins his third season at the
helm of Minnesota’s offense, he
continues to produce.

Even though his Gophers are
0-2, after two tough loses to
San Jose State and Colorado,
Fleetwood is leading the team
in rushing and passing’./‘
Fleetwood is averaging 6.8
yards a carry while rushing for
178 yards in Minnesota’s first

  Minnesota

By Ryan Buncher

Sports Editor

 The Panther_football offense,

which has struggled to score
for the past two weeks, will
face Minnesota minus one of
their top scoring threats —run-
ning back Curtis Martin. R

Martin leads the team in
rushing with 246 yards as well
as scoring four touchdowns. He
injured an ankle in the first half
of last Thursday’s game at
Rutgers and will not play this
week.

“He was hurt in the first half
with an ankle and he tried to

’_)play,” Pitt head coach Paul

I.-Iackett said.

Martin returned for the sec-
ond half and ran the ball four
times for only nine yards after
running for 40 yards on eight
carries in the first half.

‘‘[We] probably shou1d‘not I

have played him in the second
half as much as we did.» He
wanted to go back in. We now
are going to rest him  make
sure he is fully rested.”

 The injury leaves Jermaine

back." He has 95 yards on 21
carries this season.

Academics are just as impor-
tant if not more important to
Davis.

“Getting a degree is the
most important thing,” Davis
said. “Foremost in my mind is
getting my degree in correc-
tions and sociology so I can
help people in correctional
institutions.”

But this doesn’t mean Davis
is not thinking about the NFL

“The thought of playing in

the NFL is always in the back
of my mind. Sure, I’d love~a
shot at playing in the NFL, but
I don’t let it cloud my

“I will just play this season

happens. Then I will take it

Known as a good “physical”

senior is the captain of the

He makes all the defensive

Defense the Soccer team Wins fifth in a row at SRU

 /eey to ea rly

By Brian Gallagher
Senior Staff Writer

’ SLIPPERY ROCK, PA --

Defense, defense, defense.

It is essential to the success
of any sports team.

Fo-r the 1992 Pitt soccer
’tL}am, it is not only essential
—— it’s the rule.

In yesterday’s 2-0 struggle of
a victory a-gainst a lesser
Slippery Rock squad, defense
was again the order of the
day.

While the Panthers sputtered
offensively —— wasting scoring
opportunity. after scoring
opportunity — the defensive
,wall of Brian Pelligrino, Bob
Dyer, Carsten Bishop and
Charlie Wasson stood tall in
front of rookie netminder
Adam Spitzer. ‘

The result? Another Pitt

 )3l1utout.

Though they collectively
sound more like a law firm
than a firm wall of defense,
the quartet of Dyer, Bishop,
Pelligrino and Wasson have

-' provided Pitt soccer fans with

defensive security, while giv-

ing the Gerson Echeverry’s
and Justin Ceccerelli’s of the

headaches and losses.

Since the second half of
Pitt’s last loss, a 3-2 heart-
breaker to Bucknell University

.’}hree weeks ago, Panthers’

defenders have allowed just

three goals in 11 halves of

soccer; E

Included in this impressive‘
stat is two shutout overtime
periods in last week’s 1-0 win
over Geneva.

Solid play in front of
Panther goalies is nothing new
to Pitt soccer, according to
senior back Pelligrino.

“The defense has played
/really well [this year],”
' elligrino said. “Not only this
year, but every year since I’ve
been here.” ‘

"While the “D” has been all
but a given in Pitt soccer his-
tory, the offense has not
always been up to snuff. Not
this year. '

After scoring\ only seven
goals in league play all last
year, the Panthers have racked
up six goals in just three Big
East games — all Panther
wins.

The production of the
offense-has paid big dividends
for guys like Pelligrino and
Wasson, giving them time to
rest, react and recuperate --
instead of running down ball
after ball.

' “In previous years,
defense played well,”
Pelligrino said. “But we had
troubles offensively- [Now],
we’ve got some production. It
makes our job as defenders
much, much easier.”

‘ half of the Bucknell game as
-the turning point in the play

SLIPPERY ROCK, PA — The
Pitt soccer team continued to
roll, winning its fifth straight
with a 3-0 shutout over
Slippery Rock University.

Pitt’s junior midfielder Eric
Duffy started‘ things off, scor-
ing at the 20:12 mark in the

- first half.

Duffy took advantage of a

_ mistake when an SRU defend-

er couldn’t‘ clear the ball fro_m
the mouth of the goal and hit
the ball to Duffy.
- “The goalie committed a lit-
tle early, so I placed it beside
him down in the corner,”
Duffy said.

Duffy’s shot beat SRU’s

A keeper Mike Doutrich to the

left side with a low shot, sup-
plying Pitt’s first-year goalie
Adam Spitzer with all he
needed to rack up his third
shutout of the season.

Senior defender Michael

Basaca scored just seven min-
utes into the second half. He
hit paydirt when a rebound
off of Doutrich’s head landed
between him and the net.

“Coach always tells us to go
after the ball in the box,” said
Basaca. “I was there, and it
was an easy put away.”

SRU never had a chance to
get on the board, as Pitt’s
defense, led by ].R. Perdue
and Bobby Dyer, sent away
any SRU offensive attack.

In the final minutes of the
game, sophomore Eric Prex
found the the back of the goal

for the fifth time this year,-

continuing his fine play for
the panther’s. Prex’s hard
work was rewarded with his
being named co—offensive
player of the week in the con-
ference.

Although Pitt (5-2, 3-0 in the
Big East) spent most of the
game in SRU’s territory and
outshot them 17-3, Pitt head

main man.’ “He’s a fine’ com-
petitor, a great leader  and
I’m glad he’s our quarterback.”

Fleetwood has earned praise
from Hackett as well.

“He’s off and running, two
tremendous ballgames. He’s a
major concern of ours,”
Hackett said.

According to Wacker,
turnovers have been the major
problem plaguing the entire
Gopher attack, with six in
their first two outings.

Tailback Antonio Carter is
off toia solid start, with 125
yards and a 4.8 average per
carry. _

True freshman Chris Darkins
(6 feet 1 inch, 190 pounds)
has carried the ball 14 times
for 101 yards and a 7.2 aver-
age.

Minnesota should look to
establish the run early but can
open it up with a‘ three—receiv-
er set. V

Slotback Oma Douglas
ranks among the top receivers
in the nation statistically, with
15 receptions for 208 yards
(13.9 avg) and one touch-
down.

Sophomore Lewis Garrison
(four receptions for 52 yards)
backs up Douglas. Senior
wideout John Lewis also pos-
sesses tremendous speed and
good hands. He has
five catches for 55 yards thus
far. ‘i 7

Senior right guard Ted
Harrison (6’—-4”, 297 pounds)
anchors an experienced offen-
sive line. The 1991 second-
team A1l—Big Ten selection

is joined by‘ 500—pound
senior Keith Ballard at left
tackle, 298—pound junior
Robert Rogers at left guard,
Neil Fredenburg at center
and David Vertin at right tack-
le.

If this unit executes, Wacker
feels the Gopher offense will
unleash potent weapons.

“If we can give the quarter-
back time enough to throw

the ball, I think they can do

some damage,” Wacker said.

Panther free safety Lex
Perkins expects Minnesota to
throw the football often,
something it did last season
when Fleetwood put .it up 40
times.

“They run a lot of crossing
routes. That makes it hard to
play man-to-man,” Perkins
said. “Douglas is the best
receiver. I’m.not particularly
concerned about anybody on
that team.”

Linebacker Gerald Simpson
and defensive end Jeff Esters
put some ‘heat on Rutgers’
quarterback Brian Fortay a
few times last week — some-
thing Pitt did not do much of
in its first two outings.

Simpson’s five solo tackles
and one sack added the
much-needed spark against
the Knights while Esters con-
tributed two big sacks.
Simpson said he expects more
progress from the Pitt pass
rush this week.

Perkins feels the Pitt defense
needs to execute its assign-
ments better, but said the hit-

ting and work ethic are-

improving. _

One huge problem contin-
ues to be missed tackles, and
with speedsters like
Fleetwood, Douglas and
Lewis, Pitt cannot afford
to continue that trend this
week.

Minnesota will have its hands
full this Saturday.

_“There’s no question Curtis is
a fine football player,” Wacker
said. “But they’ve got a lot of
good football players. T hey’re
not going to change their
offense all that much.

“Whoever lines up, we’re
going to have to be concerned
about putting the brakes on
them.”

Aiming to put the brakes on
Pitt’s hit~or-miss passing attack
will be the quartet of Golden
Gophers’ linemen, which
includes, left to right, junior
Dennis Cappella, sophomore
Doyle Cockrell, junior Ed
Hawthorne and junior Andy
Kratochvil. Junior Travis Walker
will also see plenty of Pitt
Stadium turf.

Perhaps Minnesota’s weakest
defensive link lies at the cor-
nerback position, according to
Wacker, who says that the
Golden Gophers’ safeties must
improve from their perfor-
mances from the first two
weeks to survive against Pitt.

“We’ve got to get a little bet-
ter play out of our safeties,”
Wacker said. “Dietrich Jells
scares the daylights out of you
every time he runs down the
field. All their guys run well.

“We've got our work cut out
for us.”

The Golden Gophers’ back-
field includes junior Drinon

For Wacker, the combination
of experience and speed in the
Panthers’ offense provides his
young defense with a formida-
ble foe.

“They’ve got some good run-
ning backs, big lineman,”
Wacker said. “Pitt has nine
seniors starting on offense
alone. We’ve got two on
defense.

“We’ve got a tremendous
challenge [this Saturday nightl.”

For a team that was picked
last in the nation by Penthouse
magazine, dreams of bowl bids
and national acclaim are as
far fetched as a ‘92 Pitt bowl
bid. 2

chances. -

“We passed up a lot of
opportunities,” Luxbacher
said. “We’re not making good
decisions.”

Pitt botched a three-on-one
play in the second half and
had numerous shot opportuni-
ties inside the 18-yard line in
the first half, but they seemed
reluctant to shoot the ball.
Against Big East foes, Pitt will
have to be ready to pull the
trigger.

Despite yesterday’s poor
play outside SRU’s goal,
Basaca said Pitt will be ready
for its Big East showdown
with Villanova.

‘‘We didn’t play to well
today,” Basaca said. “It’s tough
getting up for a game like
this.”

Basaca may be referring to
the fact that SRU is a Division
11 school, and this weekend’s
home game is against a 5-1 (1-
0 in the Big East) Villanova
squad.

“Sunday will make or break
us this season,” Duffy said. “If
we win, we should go on to a
good record in the Big East.”

Pitt suffered a blow in yes-
terday’s victory. when Jeff
Porter went down with an
ankle injury in the second
half. _

“It hurts a lot [Porter’s
injuryl,” said Prex. “He might

not start, but coming off the
bench he’s a real tough play-
er.”

The team does not know the
severity of Porter’s injury, so
there is a chance he’ll be
available for the Villanova
game.

Sunday’s game is a match-
up of the number four and
five ranked teams in the ISAA
Mid-Atlantic Region. ‘Nova,
ranked ahead of Pitt, will have
to play hard to knock off the
Panthers in their own jungle.

Villanova, picked seventh in
the Big East preseason poll, is
another early season surprise.
Senior Eric Hinds, this week’s
co-offensive player of the
week, won two games for the
Wildcats with goals off the
bench. A

One of those victories came
against Georgetown when he
broke a 1-1 tie in the second
half. V

Last year, Villanova made
the Big East playoffs with the
help of two All—Big East play-
ers, forwards Den Santos and
Joe Roy.

Their goalie Michael
Guarino proved valuable last
year when he posted a 1.88
GAA and‘ five shutouts.

The Wildcats finished 11-7
and 4-4 in the Big East which
was good enough for third
place.

Sunday’s home game against
Villanova will start at 1 p.m. at
Pitt Stadium.

a lot,” Fle_etwood said."‘They
also make the big plays.”

Minnesota Coach Jim Wacker
said that his Minnesota team
will have to play well this
weekend to allow Fleetwood to
make the crucial plays against
the Panthers.

“We have got to have a run-
ning "game to give Marquel time
to establish our passing game,”
Wacker said.

Wacker, in his first season as

Pi‘-L” 1'1

head coach at Minnesota, is
pleased with Fleetwood’s per-
formance so far this season.

“Marquel is a good athlete,
he has a good arm and great
quickness,” Wacker said. “He is
a fine leader and I’m glad he is
our quarterback.”

leader is almost impossible, Pitt
will try to contain Fleetwood
the best it can.

“We will have to play man-
to-man defense at times as well

as zone defenses at other
times,” Hackett said. “Our abili-
ty to play Fleetwood man—to—
man will contain his run while
our zones should contain his
passing.”

By doing this, Hackett said
he hopes to keep Fleetwood
off balance.

Hackett knows what the
Gopher quarterback can do,
just by remembering last year’s
game.

Fleetwood’s leadership, cou-

then-fateful, now-fruitful half
of soccer, the Panthers
allowed three goals, two of
which came off the foot of
Pelligrino.

“It really took Cal. State and
Bucknell [losses] to turn our
heads and learn how to do
the‘ right things,” Pelligrino
said.

“Once we got over those
mental breakdowns, we’Ve
played well.”

Since the Bucknell wake—up
call, the Pitt defensive has
maintained an aggressive atti-
tude towards attacking oppo-
nents before the opponents
attack them.

According to “Panther Wall” .

success lies in effort, not in the
outcome of games. _

“We don’t make a big deal
out of losses,” Wacker said.
“IAnd] we don’t make a big
deal over wins.

I "We play it as hard as we can

play it  and if that’s not good '

enough, we tee it up [again
next week,” he said. ’

While Wacker and the rest of
the Minnesota football squad
are doing anything but conced-
ing a victory to the home-
standing Panthers, a lot of
things must go right for them
and wrong for Pitt, for his first
win in the land of 10,000 lakes
to take place.

“Thank goodness it’s foot-
ball,” Wacker said. “Anything
can happen on a given day.”

member Bob Dyer, -the com-
munication between him and
his defensive cohorts has been
the key reason why the four-
some —— and the rest of the
team — have stopped most
opposing threats venturing
into Pitt territory-

“Even if [an opponent] beats
one of us,” Dyer said. “We
react and make them make a
decision.”

That confrontational style
has put Pitt face—to—face with
something they say little of in
1991 —— victories.

With a glowing 5-2 record
heading into Sunday’s first-
place showdown against
Villanova, -

Dyer expects more of the

same effort, with added inten- I

sity from a defense that has
been anything but laid back
thus far this season.

“I hear that they have a _'

high-powered offense,” Dyer
said. “What we’ll do is play
solid “D,” and counter [offen-
sively] with numbers.”

If such a game—plan comes
off without a hitch as it has
the past three Big East games,
Dyer, Pelligrino and the rest

A of this upstart Panther team
just may ‘find themselves all ‘

alone atop the conference
standings.

Not bad for a team pegged
to finish last in the Big East
coaches’ poll. ‘

The Pitt defense will take it.

pled with a little good luck and
some big plays, might just be
enough to upset the Panthers
this Saturday. -

“In order for us to win we
will need to get the big play,”
Fleetwood said.

“Football is a" game of
momentum, and if we get the
momentum early, we have a
chance [to win].”

To win, however, will take
some of Fleetwood’s ability to
spark his team with some big

plays, some key actions or
some of his inspirational lead-
ership.

“As a quarterback you have
to provide leadership to the
whole offense,” Fleetwood
said.

“As a senior it is necessary
to be a leader for the whole
team.

“Leadership is like-a domino
effect — it starts at the top and
works its way down,”
Fleetwood said.
