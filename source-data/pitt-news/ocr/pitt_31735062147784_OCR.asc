   UN lino TAXATION

Dr. Richard T. C_Ely,,.one oi’ the pic-
neers" in Economics, addressed Dr.
McKay’s Public Finan-ceVC Cclass -on
“Land Taxation” in V113 Alumni Hall
last Friday morning at 10:30 o’clock.; C
He told of the tendency of liberty

istrationetto increase taxation. “VSwat--

revenue. He claimed that taxes ~ on
iorms of taxation" must be employed to
secure a suﬂicient diffusion Lo£Ctaxes.:~
-He told alittle or Lland_ta.xVaLtion»a1CId
utilization. He said that most of the
good land is in» use and is not! being

evil. He said one of the "remediesfor-C
bad agrarian conditions is to get’ that
kind of land out ‘of use for taxation
brings intense privately ‘owned sub-
marginal land. and brings into use
prematurely agricultural, urban -and
forest land. ' C C .-

He stated that land values depended
on’ other things‘ than population»?
changes and that land“ values have .
lost L in cqLmpariCson with other forms
of Wealth. Hesaid that land values
have V fallen in their proportion to
otherLL, forms of-L wealth, and are Cin-
creasing more slowly than public ex-
penditures and would be inadequate as
a sole source of revenue and that land

and decreasing with public needs.

. ,He recommended " that land taxes
-be used“ chieﬂy for local-revenues. He
saidthat land taxation lshould be real

"old Moorhead Public School. Subse-
‘quently he completed his preparation
I‘ -for college at Park Institute. M ,
On June 24, 1898, he enlisted as a‘
1 “private in Compa.nY,“H” Of the Tenth
-Regiment, Pennsylvania Volunteers.
. He went with this historic outfit to
I .,ft'l1e Philippine Islands, participating
: in several battles and was discharged
~ from service August 22, 1899.
I When the World War broke out Cap.-
‘,-tain Vvoodside was again determined
S110 enter the service. In order to make
‘certain that he would be eligible for
*the fighting ranks he went to a hos-
"épital and underwent an operation in‘
order that he might pass the neces-'
, ,jsa,ry physical examination. He then
' went to the Second Officers’ Training
 Station at Fort Oglethorpe, Ga. On
.jNovember 24, 1917, he was commis-
 sioned" as Captain o-f Infantry, and

, engagement was on the Champagne‘
%Marne defensive sector on the Marne.
’-He was’ in the historic encounter
‘when the Germans were stopped at
Wthe Marne on July 31.
 _ As a. result of their bravery and
historic stand in the Marne defen-
sive the 38th Infantry has been offi-
_ giaﬂy recognized by ;-the War Depart-
A ment as -the “Rock of the Marne.”
Captain VVoodside and his company
I then took part in the Aisne-Marne of-
fensive and the historic conflicts
that were waged around Fismes. He

, There were three great conflicts
,-in which the American Armies par-
ticipated in the World War—on the
“Marne, at St. Mihiel and in the Ar-

‘joys the distinction of having par-
‘-ticipated in each. He wears six bat-
le clasps on his victory medal.
._‘While engaged in the fighting near
-Romagne in the Meuse-Argonne on
October 9, 1918,, Captain Woodside
received shrapnel wounds. and was in

PITT TRIO OF COACHES
RETURN TO .LAFAYETTE

Dr. J. B. (Jock) Sutherland, ’18,
will return to Lafayette College as
head football coach next season and
will take with him “Pud” Seidel and
“Skip” Gougler, well known Pitt
stars, who were his right hand men
last fall. Official announcement to
this effect has just been made by

the Lafayette authorities. Seidel grad-

uates from the Dental School this
June. Gougler completed, his course
in ’21, and is now an instructor in
the Dental School}.

Cap-tain Woodside rallied the men
of one platoon of his command who
were fallingvback in disorder, reformed
them under heavy enemy shell. and
machine-gun fire and led them to
theleft ‘front: of the Battalion Sector
and engaged the attacking enemy.
His: prompt actirn stopped an envel-
oping movement of the enemy which
imperiled the ‘position of the battal-
ion.”

Prior to this in the Marne- defen-
sive, he received the following cita.«
tion: - I

“As a. Capt'r.in' of Infantry, com-
manding ’Co-mpaxiy ‘M,’ Thirty-eighth
U. S. Infantry, ‘Captain Woodside dis-
played ezxceptior.-al- bravery and ﬁne
leadership I when his: company was
rep~ea.teId—ly attacked by a large part
of a German regiment during twr
days and nights of almost incessant
ﬁghting. Through the force‘ of hir
own courageous» example he led his
men to the -successful reipulse of the
attacks, making many prisoners and
never yielding any ground asisigne-<l
to him for defense.”

On his return to Pittsburgh, Cap-
tain VV'0lods~ide again took up the
-prarwice of law and renewed his long
time interest in the Veterans of For-

eign Vvars of the United States. As

a recognition of his standing as a
soldier he was u'.Ia.nimou.s-ly elected
National [Commander-in4Chief of the
Veterans’
United States for the second time at
its- convention held in “Washington in
Septc~ml:er, 1920-. ‘He was elected for
the» third time at the annual Encamp-

ment held in Detroit in September,

1921.

IIEIIAIIT’S,AI’PlIINTMENT
AS WASH. 8: LEE IIIIAEII

MEETS WITH APPIIIIVAE

 

Big headlines in the Virginia and
VVa.s~‘l1ingt0n & Lee Ugliversity papers
announce the appointment of “Jim-
my” 1),eha1:t_a,,s, head coach of ath-
letics and the articles all indicate
that the selection of Pitt’s popular
four-letter man has struck a popular
chord with the alumni and students
of that institution. Commenting edi-
torially on the appointment the VV. &
L. official publication has this to say
is the
Man”:

The five men from the Athletic
Council to whom -the important pow-
er of selecting a’ new head coach was
entrusted have done their work well.
Under unusual circumstances and in
the light of the athletic and financial
situations here, a delicate‘ and diffi-
cult task has been performed with
excellent results but sans ostentation.

James Deha.-rt is the man for the
job. Not only was he suggested from
widely separated quarters, and rec-
ommended both by authorities on
football and by men who know him
personally, but also by such men as
Lawrence W’. W’itten, ’10, and Jogger
Elcock, whose motives and sincerity
are above question. Hisatbletic ca-
reer has been of such inclusive va-
riety and consistent brilliancy that
.-little else could be desired in that di-
rection; besides this, he has demon-
strated his abilities as a practical
coach. ’. .. A

The advantages of matured athletic
experience and a broad vision of the
ultimate purposes of college athletics
are both his, "and he has yet the vim
and energy of youth. He is not
steeped in any particular narrowing
theories or iron-clad and binding doc-
trines.

“Jimmy” ,Dehart is coming to
Washington & Lee because he likes
the looks of things. and because he is
in sympathy with the ideas and ideals
of W. & L. athletics. I

We predict that he will be well
liked, competent, feariless, and that
he will not ‘hesitate nor lack the
means to surprise both our very
worthy opponents and a few not very
distant pessiniistic reactionaries.

The Lynchburg News devotes a
column to Dehart and his record as
a. Pitt athlete, winding up with this
statement: a

Dehart will not assume his new
duties'at Wa.shi.ngton & Lee before
next September, since Raftery’s con-
tract will not expire until the end of
the present school year. It is cer-
tain that the new mentor of athletics
will receive the cordial co-operation
of faculty and students‘ alike here,
since satisfaction with his selection
has been expressed on every side.

The selection of an assistant coach
for the coming year has not yet been
made by the committee, although it
is expected that this position will be
filled within the next few weeks.-

It ' is an outstanding fact that the

   that there is one great barrier which
‘ J   places itself -between the apex of .ac-

complishment and mediocrity. ’ That
(barrier can be removed, and with
only a. slight modiﬁcation of the pres-
ent system. ‘ A

= p . . . THE TRACK SCHEDULE, . ’
u The track schedule, just completed by-Man'alger‘Sam Nicholson, is cer-
Ltajnly a_ tribute to the growth‘ of that sport at Pitt. ltwould seem that little
more in the way of a schedule could be asked for. - Evpry Saturday furnishes
«a meet cffsome sort. in which Pltti runners meet some of the country's best
and In everyjdual meet arranged there is a natural rivalry between the Uni-
vetrsity and its opponent. It is practically an impossibility to na‘me.any team
in the country more entitled to be onithe schedule than those already there.
The only, unfortunate thing is that a place could not be found for Ohio State,
for there‘ should grow up~a natural rivalry between the Ohio institution,
one of the best in every respect In. the Middle west, and Pitt, which ranks
as one of the leading'colleges1*of the East. .  6 . B A ‘ ‘ .
‘Every incentive possible is furnishe,d.the members of the team, both in
the way of splendid competition and in the way of trips. Just take _a glance
atpthe globe-trotting that will be done by most of the members, of the team.
The itinerary will .tal<e in Baltimore, Blacksburg, Van? Annapolis, Md.;. Phil-
adelphia,“ Syracuse, West Point, Philadelphia again’ ‘for some‘, Washington,
Pa., for others, Morgantown, W. Va., and -State College.» ll: is pretty hard to
beat that. ‘ 1 _ p, * ' . ~
THE..-FRATERNITIES ARE CO-OPEIYRATING , 1
The manner in which, the fraternities havebeeh co-operating with the
-University athletic management especially in the interfraternlty track com-
petitions has been ,a Scource of great pleasure to those in charge of Pitt’s
‘£lthletlGS;»}; Great beneﬁtlnas‘ becnfderlv.ed»all around. from the two events held
to date but no greater benefits are being derived by any than by the fra-
ternities themselves, who see in the events an opportunityfor promoting
better .lnterfraternil:y fellowship andsan opportunity for creating greater In-
-terest within the respective. fraternities not only in athletics but in the9frater-
nity‘ itself. A‘spi"rlt -'is being stirred up among the fraternities, which have
been ‘competing,’ which is a. reincarnationiof collegerivalry and college on-
thusiasm, in miniature. Acouple of the fraternities who have had: teams
entered thus far are deserving of especial credit for their willingness to co-
.op_erate, lnjspite-of’ the fact that tlier‘e_ may be little athlctlcmaterial within
thegfratosrihtitles. It is too bad that the remaining fraternities of the Inter-
fraternlty Conference have/not seen ﬁt to enter the events to date, for the
loss ls—th,eir own mainly. Nevertheless, the series ‘of events promises to be
much more successful this year than“ last and the lnterest should continue
throughout the entire series at a‘much higher pitch than
standing of the teams will be watched eagerly each week.
. .  »,  . THE PENN STATE GAME 9‘ S
g — The biggest homo basket .ball,.game ofthe year takes place’at Motor
Square Garden a week from this Friday night. At that time Pitt is going
to ﬁrmly establish its right tosectional honors by taking the measure of our
old rivals from Center County. _For_ some time the Panthers, had been unable
to capture a single series from State in any branch of sport. .In that time

lee in the country. The worm turned last—_”.lune at State College whemafter
the State pine had won 20 out of‘ 21; games, Pitt handed‘ them two severe
wallopings‘ on the diamond. Following thegame the resolution was made
by Tommy Davle_s,captain ofthls "year-’s football team; by Tommy ‘Holleran,
captain-elect of‘ next year’_s- eleven; by Lloyd Jordan, captain of the basket
ball team, and by Lee Cook, captain-elect of the baseball team, that the year
1921-22 wouldvsee Penn state victorious ‘over the Panthers in not a single
branch of'sport, excepting p.ossibly.l:_rack, and sit wasdeclded we were going
-to lick State in track _the year after this one. At. any rate that indicates the
spirit wit!-rwhlch athletes representing the old blueand gold meet the wearers
of the blue and white and Lloyd Jordan is going to lead his team ontoth/e
floor nine days from nowtwlth every: determination to knock State back irito
the mlddleoif Center County. An atmosphere of premonition supnoundgd the
resolves of those Panther athletic leaders at State last year and a Pltt'vlc-

The Phi Gamms were victors in the
