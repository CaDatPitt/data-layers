O’Connor rejects recommendation to remove 

By Jennifer Calabrese
Editor iii Chief

Pitt President J. Dennis O’Connor will
not phase out the university’s ROTC
program, despite recommendations from
a university senate committee which called

for ROTC to be removed from campus in A

1997.

In May of 1991, the University Senate
Council ad-hoc committee on the ROTC
recommended an eight-point plan to deal
with the conﬂict between the university’s
anti—discrimination policy forbidding
discrimination on the basis of sexual
orientation and the Department of
Defense’s policy‘ banning homosexuals
from the military. ,

O’Connor endorsed all but the one
point. which called for the ROTC to be
phased out by 1997 if the Department of
Defense did not change its policy by then.
O’Connor explained that his decision was

based on a belief that the university should
not act alone against the ROTC but should
instead work with organizations like the
American Association of Universities to
influence the DOD’s policy. _

“It is my belief that we are more powerful
acting together then we are acting alone,”
O’Connor told a meeting of the University
Senate Council. “In acting alone, the
immediate effect is likely to harm a segment
of our community that has benefitted from
and has had its education paid for by the
ROTC. In acting alone, we are unlikely to
bring about what we really desire, which
is the end of the discriminatory policy."

O'Connor said he will do everything in
his power to work with outside university
organizations to change the DOD’s
“reprehensible” policy.

O’Connor said he will act on the seven
other points of the senate committee's
recommendation, which include: the
university’s acknowledgement of the

conﬂict with the ROTC, the recognition
that the ROTC is a program supported by
the university, the university joining with
otherAAU universities to change the DOD’s
policy and the encouragement of students
who are victims of discrimination in the
ROTC program to report the discrimination
to the Office of Student Affairs. In
compliance with another point in the
recommendation, O’Connor said he will
send a letter to Secretary of Defence Dick
Cheney expressing his disapproval of the
DOD’s policy.

O’Connor said he will follow the
recommendation of the committee which
calls for all university brochures which
describe ROCT programs to include this
statement: “ROTC programs discriminate
against students on the basis of sexual
orientation and therefore are not in
compliance with the university's anti-
discrimination policy.-” , I ,

— ~ Pitt is not the only university struggling

with the conflict between the ROTC and
campus anti—discrimination policies.

Amherst College and Harvard University

are among the schools that have removed
ROTC from their campuses because of the
discrimination conﬂict. Other schools,
including the University of California at
Los Angeles have opted to try to influence
the DOD with letters and lobbying instead.

At Pitt, reaction to O’Connor’s decision
was mixed. ,

Former University Senate President
Barbara Shore, who chaired the ROTC
committee, said she was pleased that
O’Connor accepted most of the
recommendations of the committee, but
that the DOD might not change its policy
without a serious threat from the university.
The committee had “no desire to hurl
ROTC off campus,” Shore said. But the
phase—out was the “club behind the carrot."

Shore echoed concerns from other

Pitt commission
defends position
on installation

By Jennifer Calabrese
Editor in Chief

Recent criticism over the cost of the festivities will not
derail the university’s plans to install Pitt President J.
"Dennis O’Connor.

The 44—member commission on the installation met
yesterday and voted unanimously to retain its plans to
hold the $92,550 installation.

Reports of the cost of the installation have drawn
criticism from state and local officials who say the
installation is inappropriate spending.

“When numbers are quoted in the abstract or
inappropriate comparisons are made as they have been
done in the press, it can be made to look like a great
extravagance. The fact is that for what we are doing and
what benefits the university is getting, thecommission
believes that the expenditures are appropriate and
responsible,” said Bill King, a member of the
commission.

King spoke at yesterday's University Senate Council
meeting to explain the commission's position on the
expenditure. ’

“I am here at this meeting because it is really the
commission that has been responsible for the planning of
this event, and I really felt that if it was going to be a public
execution or whipping"  the commission members
ought to be here to accept that rather than to allowthe
president and provost to take the flack,” King
said.

The commission felt that the installation ceremony is
appropriate and that the University of Pittsburgh needs
to commemorate a new era at the university, King said.
The commission planned the event with what “we
considered to be appropriate concern for costs and
benefits,” he added.

O’Connor also said that the installation events were
important for the university.

“The purpose of this installation is  to provide an
opportunity to the university community after a year and
a half of struggle to recognize its vitality,” O’Connor
said. ‘

But some at the meeting still questioned the use of
university funds for the installation. Student Government
Board President Gil Golden asked Provost Donald
Henderson if the money might not have been better used
for student scholarships.

Henderson said that although the money could have

The Income-Dependent Education
Act will allow ‘college students to
receive federal loans, regardless of
their parents’ income.

Rep. Tom Petri of Wisconsin
initiated the proposal, which would

' allow students to borrow up to

$70,000 for college and graduate
school and $143,000 for medical
school. Students would not be
required to repay their loans until
they had completed their educations.

The repayments will be based on

ew IDEA for studen

 
   

the former students’ incomes and
will be taken out of their paychecks
along with Social Security. Evading
the repayments would be considered
tax evasion. However, if the former
student earns below the amount for
paying income tax, no repayments
would be required for that year.

It is estimated that it will take 12 to
17 years to pay off the loan, but any
repayments left over after 25 years
will be “wiped off the books,” Petri
said.

According to Petri, the proposal
will save taxpayers an estimate of $1
billion a year because many student

financial aid

loans end up in default, which leaves
the repayments up to the taxpayers.
Since the repayments of the loan
would be collected and calculated by
the Internal Revenue Service, the
defaults of the usual student loans
would be eliminated. I
"The middle class is largely locked
out of the current loan programs, and
at the same time the Department of
Education expects 53.6 WHO“ of
student-loan defaults this year,” Petr!
said. “We need fresh thinking to
produce a simple, affordable and
universal student loan program. That's

Committee emphasizes Value of African history CORRECTION

By Mark Carlin

Have you ever heard of
Imhotep?

Did you know that the oldest
human fossil remains were found
in Kenya, or that many

anthropologists now believe that

all humans can be traced back to
one African woman?

“Americans are notbeing taught
about the contributions of Africans

_ in history,” he said.

As a result, the steering
committee of the BAS established
the Re-Education Committee to
address this problem and meet
the educational needs of African-
Americans.

“The Re-Education Committee
is about educating, uplifting and
celebrating the contributions of
African knowledge and spirit to
world culture,” Sykes said.

The Re-Education Committee,
also called the Imhotep Society,
meets bimonthly to present and
discuss research based on African
contributions to world knowledge
and culture.

“There is so little known and so
much misunderstood about
African history," Sykes said.
“South Africans were smelting
iron 2,000 years before anyone
else. Africans were great

..ma.thematicians.._ astronomers, ,
' "-?philosophe"rsand.phy/siei2,ns. Butf

hardly anyone knows because
it's not taught.”

Sykes said American attitudes‘ A

about African history and culture
are not just a product of
educational failures but also a
“subtle brainwashing" going on
throughout the culture.

Sykes pointed to American
movies which present the ancient
Egyptian nobility as white
while the ignorant slaves were
black.

“The ancient Egyptians were
black Africans whose skin has

mentioned erroneous images of
ignorant, heathen blacks living in

the jungle petrified of the white

The Imhotep -Society took 
name from one of the greatest

physicians in history.

Imhotep was called Asclepius  __
by the Greeks and itwas Asclepius  "

His name is still» partiiof

According to Sykes, many‘

Americans know about
Hippocrates but almost no one
has heard of Imhotep.

“I went into the medical library
and looked at the copy of
Imhotep’s book and saw that it
had not been checked out since
1972,” Sykes said.

Imhotep was also a magician,

On Feb. 6, the House Education

George Conant, a legislative

got a lot of support at the

He also said that at the hearing

the IRS said it would be able to

collect and calculate the

want to because the IRS said it
looks like a non-taxable debt.
Also, the IRS would have to

error, the following proﬁle was
printed yesterday without the
corrwpcmdingcontinuation. The
Pitt News is reprinting the article
in its entirety today.

Barbara Shore, director of the
doctoral program at Pitt's School
of Social Work, was honored for
her life's work when she was
chosen to be a Distinguished
Daughter of Pennsylvania.
Shore's humanitarian aid to the
poor, survivors of war, women
and minorities won her the award.

In addition to her administrative
duties at Pitt, Shore also teaches
graduate-level courses. Some of
the classes deal with death and
dying, family violence, micro-
social science theory and mental

health policy. She also evaluates
research and works on the
dissertation committee.

‘The Intervention in Death and
Dying class is overly subscribed,’
Shore said. “It is one of my
favorites.‘

Shore is involved with the
University Senate, where she co-
chaired the ad-hoc committee
that recommended that ROTC be
removed from campus by 1993.

‘It's a shame that any
organization that openly
discriminates like [ROTC] is
allowed to function,” she said.

Shore said she hopes that more
women will become involved
with campus issues. “Pitt is a
relatively good school for women.
But things would be a whole lot
better if there were more women
faculty, and in the administration.”

She received her bachelor’s

She went on to Pitt to get master's

helping 175 young Jewish men
who survived the Nazi
concentration camps adjust to
post-war life. None of the men
had any living family members
and were sent to Chicago.

“I really felt for those young
men,” said Shore.

After working with the
survivors, she supervised a
homeless program and oversaw
projects that aided the poor.
Finally, she decided to come to
Pitt to work.

Pitt President J. Dennis

“positive changes,” according to
Shore. The university is now

‘more academia-centered, like it
should be,‘ she said. “I'm really
pleased to hear ‘chancellor’ —
it's more academia—sounding.'
She said his promise of more
openness is “starting to happen."

She invited the entire campus
to see her travel tape, which tells
the story of how she and her
husband spent the last summer
in Siberia looking for his long-
lost relatives.

Shore said that the story “is
very moving." They will be
showing the tape, Story of
Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob on
Feb. 23 at 2:30 p.m. in the
Assembly Room of the William
Pitt Union.

Together Shore and her
husband go to the opera,
symphony and the ballet. “We
also like to see the new’
experimental plays,” she said

When taking a break from the
cultural scene, she and her
husband go to Pirate games, Pitt
football games or the movies.

How does she manage to do
everything? “I run a lot. I’m always

been used for something like

scholarships the university had
to make “difficult decisions” and
decided to use the money for
the installation.

Originally, about $10,000 of
the $92,550 cost was being raised
by alumni donations. Since Pitt
began receiving criticism about
the event, former University of

Pittsburgh National Alumni
Association Presidenﬂvoodruff
Turner began a fund-raising
campaign."

Currently, Turner said friends

of his have pledged close to»

$15,000 or more.

He said he hopes to raise the
full amount or at least a
substantial portion of the
money.

“We have a new president we
think a lot of, and I don’t want
his tenure to start out under
all this vexation,” Turner
said.

But Golden said that even if
all of the installation costs are
paid by alumni donations, he
still will not be completely
satisfied.

“Those donations could have

been paid for scholarships, too,”
he said.

In other business at ‘the
meeting, O’Connor discussed the
impact that Gov. Robert Casey's
proposed FY93 budget will have

I on Pitt's ﬁnances.

The governor’s budget calls
for a $5.9 million reduction in
Pitt funds.

The administration is looking

into ways of working without
those state funds, O’Connor said.

Among the options being

considered is raising tuition
more than six percent or
finding ways to make the
University of Pittsburgh more
cost—efﬁcient.

“I look at raising tuition above
six percent as the absolute last
resort,” O’Connor said.

Safety at top priority when students choose housing

By Suzann Gries
Staﬂ’ wrun-

Living on-campus is the safest option for
Pitt students, according to Department of
Public Safety Assistant Director Walt
Waters.

"We have very little trouble with outsiders
in the dorm area,” Waters said.

Campus police Officer Roland Hopewell
agreed. “The dorms are very safe because
of the security you have at each door,” he
said.

Hopewell, who has worked for the
campus police for about 21 years, said
there is a police officer on foot 24 hours a
day in the Schenley Quad area. There is
also a police car that patrols the Forbes
and Fifth Avenue areas 24 hours a day and
another officer on foot in the Forbes Quad
area.

“As far as criminal activity, we have very
little,” Hopewell said.

However Waters said the protection in
the residence halls “will notwork if students
sign in people they don't know.”

Waters said that off-campus students
should be aware that “the further you
remove yourself from the campus, the less

The South Oakland Citizens Council
wants students to join in setting up a
neighborhood crime—watch system in
an effort to make Oakland a safer
place.

“The student body has got to know
that they can’t deal with safety issues
only when something happens, because
it’s too_ late then,” Pat Scanlon, SOCC
executive director, said.

Scanlon recommended some safety
tips to aid students when they are
looking for apartments. First, make
sure the windows are secure and have
locks. Another thing to look for is dead
bolt locks for doors.

Scanlon also advised students to look
at the shrubbery and lighting
surrounding the building. Working
smoke detectors are required in
buildings, she said.

According to Scanlon, it does not

matter which floor a person lives on.
Depending on the building, the first
floor could be just as safe as the third
floor. For example, if the first-floor
windows have bars but the third ﬂoor
has a fire escape, the first ﬂoor would be
a better choice because the fire escape
creates access for a potential burglar.

“It's access and opportunity you need
to look at in your surroundings. If
opportunity is presented, crime will
occur,” Scanlon said.

For students already living in
apartments, Scanlon recommended
“respecting the integrity of the security
door.” Students often prop doors open
when having parties because they are
too lazy to keep answering the door,
according to Scanlon.

Also, do not hold the door open for
another person because that person
might not belong in the apartment,
Scanlon said. Do not assume that the
person lives there.

Students should be especially careful if
they live in South Oakland, according to
Waters. He attributed the many problems
in South Oakland to the poor street lighting
and the fact that there are a lot of students
in this. area.

“For assaults and robberies, you have a
lot of side streets, and the area is not as
populated," he said.

To avoid becoming a victim of these
crimes, South Oakland Citizens’ Council
Executive Director Pat Scanlon
recommended choosing the most traveled
routes and walking in the “heavily
populated, lighted areas.”

Scanlon also said students should not
use stun guns or mace unless they are
experienced with using them. “Too often
they can be used against you,” she said.

Both Waters and Scanlon recommended
living in buildings withsecure windows,
dead bolt locks and well-lighted entrance
areas.

“There’s nothing that's foolproof. But if
you look at it from the burglar’s point of
view, the more trouble it is for him, the
better off you are," Waters said.

THE PITI‘ NEWS HOUSING GUIDE, Tuesday, February 11, 1992

 

Off-campus domiciles spread throughout city

0 Bloomﬁeld 0
Byjulie Sabol

News Assistant

Though not as widely known
as Shadyside or Squirrel Hill,
tucked away only 10 minutes
from Pitt’s campus is the small
town ofBloomfield, which many
students fondly call home.

Mainly a working-class, blue-
collar town with a lot of cultural
diversity, Bloomﬁeld is a tightly-
knit community, which is
appealing to many students
looking for that sense of security
many feel they don’t have in
Oakland.

All races reside together, and-

according to Debbie Gibbon, a
Pitt student living and working in
Bloomfield, there are not racial
problems. “It's a tight
neighborhood. I notice when my
neighbors are home, and they do
the same for me. It’s very friendly,”
Gibbon said.

Another Pitt student, Mike

Pichowsky, noticed the ethnicity
of the town and said, “It’s an old,
Italian and Irish neighborhood.
It’s like Brooklyn with good
bakeries and pizza, cheap. Italian
pizza done correctly.”

The main street of the town,
appropriately named Main Street,
contains just about everything
you would ever need in a town.
On this street, well within walking
distance of each other, are a
variety of bars and restaurants, a
laundry mat, drug store, video
rental and clothing stores, among
other businesses nestled in Main
Street's 10-minute walking length.

Perhaps due to the fact it is
such a closely knit community,
block crime watches can be found
all through Bloomfield, according
to Pitt student Tim Ford.

Another factor that keeps crime
down is the community itself,
Pichowsky said. “There are lots
of old people who get into
everyone’s business, but they

keep it safe, and I like it like that.”

Often seen as the middle of the
road between the “slums’* of South
Oakland and the “snottiness” of
Shadyside, North Oakland provides
the ideal atmosphere forstudents
who are interested_ in .a quiet and
moderately safe environmentbut

“still w o‘nly~~want' to’ be‘ .a hop, skip
and a jump off campus.

Though it still has its own fair
share of parties, North Oakland is

-neighborhood,’-’. Pete- Diel1l,:a.Pitt

     

But the most desirable aspect of
North Oakland would have. to be
its accessibility. Easy‘ to get to
classes, Shadyside and restaurants
— not to mention the fraternities
scattered throughout — North
Oakland is found to be in the
center of many things.

Home of South Craig Street,
North Oakland boasts trendy,
interesting shops. The food
selection is also varied. From Ali
Baba to Charlie’s to Great Scot, just
about every type-of appetite can

I be satisfied somewhere in North

Oakland for a reasonable price.
“I like it because it’s accessible
to other areas. You can go and do
more things in surrounding areas,”
Pitt student Brian Robbins said.
Whether traveling during the
day or at night, there are several
options. The buses that touch onto
North Oakland can easilybe picked
up and only cost$1.25. By daylight,
walking and biking are easy and
safe methods to get almost
anywhere. At night, the campus
shuttle now runs to North Oakland
and can be called to pick you up
and take you to your destination.
Best of all, the shuttle is free.

safer than South Oakland. “I feel
safer up here than I did, in South
Oakland; it’s not as party-oriented,
and it’s a little quieter,” Tanya
Lasher, a Pitt student, said.

Not dirt cheap, rents are
nonetheless affordable for
students.

“The apartments are nicer and
rents are about the same, but
they are much better compared
to South Oakland in what you
get,” Terry Feeney, a Pitt student
who pays $430 a month for his
apartment, said.

Robbins, who lives with a
roommate in an apartment
complex, pays $500 a month,
including all of his utilities.

Many students said they would
live in North Oakland again,
primarily for the convenience and
the atmosphere.

Feeney said, “It's a quieter,

better place for school work. It

will live here again. It's nice and
definitely cleaner.”

0 Shadyside 0. '
By Kirsta H. Bleyle
Staﬂ‘ Writer »

The association many students
have with Shadyside ranges from
visions of nice, tree—lined
residential areas to a lot of old
people to an area far too distant
from campus to be worth the
walk. More often than not,
though, the advantages outweigh
the disadvantages in the minds of
Pitt students. A . . . . ._

Dr. Sanford Gelb, president of
the Shadyside Chambers and a
merchant in the area, said he sees
the area as appealing to college

 students... A . ~.

He cited the accessibility of
public transportation and the

proximity to campus as two ‘

attributes of Shadyside.

“One of the advantages is that
the transportation back and forth
to the school is excellent, and I
think that the housing is very nice
here,” Gelb said. “Generally,
though, it’s not more than a mile
to a mile and a quarter from
places in Shadyside to Pitt, and
would take 20 to 25 minutes to
walk there.”

Stressing that many nurses and
doctors from Shadyside Hospital
live in the area, Gelb pointed out
that many apartments in
Shadyside are nicer than their
Oakland counterparts. Yet they
are less expensive.

These sentiments were echoed
by_]eff Koch, a junior who lives in
the Amberson Apartments in
Shadyside and pays $595 a month,
including all utilities, for a two-
bedroom apartment.

“The best thing about living in
Shadyside as compared to
Oakland is it’s safer and cleaner,”
Koch said. He added that although
living so far from campus isn’t
that great in the cold weather,
“it’s worth it as compared to
living in roach-infested holes
where the landlords just don’t
give a crap."

Amelia Cabrera, a junior who
pays $300 a month plus gas and
electric, lives in a house owned
by her uncle on South Atlantic
Avenue in Shadyside and enjoys
the residential feeling of the area.

“I like living out here because
it’s peaceful. You have a little bit
of yard, and there’s a little more
to it than just streets and
buildings,” Cabrera said. “It’s nice
because I can get away from the
campus life, but I’m not too far
away that it’s a pain for me to get
there.”

Cabrera said she takes the
Negley bus to campus, but she
admits that having to rely on
public transportation can be a
problem.

She said she feels the area
would be OK for “somebody
who’s probably not so involved
with partying much since being
here is a disadvantage as far as
transportation because the buses
only run until 12:30 at night. So if
you’re going to go anywhere,
you have to plan around that.”

Oakland Apartments

Much of ‘what is associated
with living in South Oakland is
parties and slumlords, and several
students have stated that this is
sometimes, but not always, the
case.

For example, Lisa Ulery, a senior
who pays $175 a month plus gas
and electric for her apartment on
McKee Place, said she enjoys
living off-campus and only having
to walk 10 minutes to get to the
Cathedral of Learning.

“I like living off-campus, ” Ulery
said, “because you don’t have to
worry about IDs, signing people
in and all of that stuff.” Some
people might consider all of that
stuff “security.”

But as far as the living
conditions are concerned, Ulery
added, it isn’t always so great.

“We have great parties here,”
Ulery said, “and we really don’t
worry about things getting trashed
because it’s not really that nice.”
She added that she will be moving

Legal issues of landlord-tenant agreements

Some types of exclusion
legally permitted here

By Gary Knapick
Senior stag Wruer

Most forms of housing discrimination are obvious. Any
landlord, real—estate broker or lending institution that
overtly discriminates on the basis of race, color, sex,
religion, national origin or sexual orientation can probably
expect a visit from the Commission on Human Relations
some time in the near future.

Nevertheless, in their quest to land that perfect pad or
fabulous flat, Pittstudents may encounter another, fuzzier
sort of discrimination.

What can you do, for example, if a property owner tells
undergraduates that their dream apartments are available
only to graduate students?

Apparently nothing, according to Sofronia Harris of the
city’s Commission on Human Relations. Harris said that
building owners are allowed to use their discretion to

“limit the scope” of their occupants as long as that limiting
does not result in the exclusion of any particular group
of people protected by the fair—housing provisions of the
Pittsburgh Code.

“If you include all types of people in that circle of
graduate students, you’re allowed to do that,” Harris said.

According tojohn Kardos, an attorney who said he has
represented both tenants and landlords in court, the
protections offered a potential customer of a landlord are
limited unless you belong to a “suspect class,” one of the
groups that are typically the targets of unfair treatment.

“Discrimination based on age or education really isn’t
covered” by anti—discriminat.ion laws, Kardos said.

“Unless you can prove that you’re being discriminated
against for some other reason and that [the landlord] is
using this [exclusion] as a cover for something else,
there's really nothing you can do,” Kardos said.

Kardos said that no laws govern discrimination on the
basis of income either. “They always have access to your
credit record,” Kardos said. “They could discriminate
against me because I don’t make over $100,000 a year.
They’re in the business of making money, and the state

Legal messes avoidable by understanding lease provisions

By Michael King
Stag‘ Writer

University of Pittsburgh law professor
Cyril Fox warns that students must be
aware of their legal rights when entering
into the contractual agreement of signing
a lease.

“The lease creates the minimum of legal
rights,” Fox said. '

He explained that some of the tenant's
rights are not spelled out in the lease, and
it is wise for students to be aware of these
rights.

“Most important is the right to habitable
premises," he said? m---W «WW» « 

A If the apartment“is."n"<“)‘t kept in livable" ’
condition, the tenant has several options
for remedying the situation.

sense of the kind of person they are
dealing with,” he said.

What is written on the lease is sometimes
less important than how the landlord and
tenant can deal with each other as people,
Fox explained.

Another important aspect of entering
into a lease agreement is to fully understand
how the security deposit will be used.

“It is not always used for the last month’s
rent‘. It’s just to secure the return of property
in reasonable condition,” Fox said.

Students cannot leave town and assume
they have paid the last month’s rent through
their security deposit. Fox explained this
is what lands many students in cases of
unwanted litigation.

If the landlord withholds the security
deposit, “they must give the tenant written

“The tenant should call the Allegheny
County Health Department and the City of
Pittsburgh Bureau of Building Inspection.
If the place isn’t in compliance with the
building code or the housing code, they
will declare the property unfit for human
habitation," Fox said.

Tenants must then pay six months’ rent
to Mellon Bank, which holds the money in
escrow. If the apartment is not made
livable in six months, tenants receive all
their money back and are no longer legally
bound by the lease. If it is made livable,
rent must be paid as usual, Fox.said

There are three other possible solutions
to this situation which tenants can enact.

“The tenants can make repairs
themselves and deduct that cost from the
rent. They can decide by how much the
value of the property is reduced and
deduct that much from the rent, or they
can decide the property is no longer
livable and leave,” Fox said.

Before invoking any of these remedies
tenants must first give their landlords
notice of the defect and a reasonable time
period to correct it.

“A reasonable period of time depends

CO
CO

on what the problem is,” Fox said.

He‘ explained that if a water heater
breaks it should be fixed in less than 48
hours, but if a water main ruptures in the
middle of winter it takes more time to
repair.

The Pitt Student Government Board offers
free legal counsel to students on matters
such as these. Fox recommended that
students seek this counsel before invoking
any of these remedies.

Fox stressed the importance of good
landlord—tenant relations.

“Students should be careful and get a

 

notice of what the security deposit was
used for," Fox said.

If no written notice is given, and the
security deposit is withheld, after a 60-day
time period the tenant is entitled to-twice
the amount of the original deposit. This
sum must be awarded by a court of law,
Fox explained.

Making attempts to avoid litigation is
much more important than being

.concerned with how to get into it, Fox

said.
Litigation can be avoided if the tenant

Apartment vs. dormitory the choice of oz Pitt generation 

By Katie Kaminski
Staff Writer

Most college students opt for
either a dormitory or an apartment
when choosing where to live.
One of the first things you’ll
probably want to investigate
when choosing between
university housing or an
apartment is the cost.

A single room in any of Pitt’s
dormitories is $2,574 per year,
and a double is $2,312 per year, _
according to Marleen McKinnan
of the University Housing Office.
These rooms come furnished with
a bed, dresser and desk. The
university housing fee also
includes water, electricity and
heat '

After purchasing the minimum
14—meal plan, the total cost is
$3,274 for a single, $3,012 fora
double.

An average, unfurnished two-
bedroom apartment-in Oakland,
on the other hand, rents for
approximately $494 per month,
according to information
provided by the Commuter
Resource Center.

Splitting the cost of an
apartment with a roommate and

supposing you already had -

fumiture, the total cost, September
through April, is $2,026. This
figure may or may not include all

. utilities; if not, plan on spending

more for gas, electricity and water.

Since the cost of apartments
and dorms are approximately
equal, other advantages and
disadvantages must be weighed.
‘ Avoiding university policies is
one benefit of living in an
apartment, say many apartment
dwellers.

“When you live off—campus,
you don’t have to sign your friends
in and out like library books,”
said Michelle West of Semple
Street. When living off-campus,
“(You don’tl have to deal with
this craziness of only having a
few friends over,” she said,
referring to the university’s policy
of limiting the number of visitors

i that dorm residents have in their

rooms to five at any one time.

This, however, must be
weighed against the fact that an
apartment will not have a cleaning
staff to scrub the bathroom and
vacuum the hallways.

Another policy that can be
avoided in an apartment is the
alcohol limit. Unlike the university
policy of limiting the amount of
alcohol you may register to your
dorm room to either 12 cans of
beer, one pint bottle, one 375 ml.
bottle of liquor or one 1.5 liter

bottle of wine, students who live
in apartments can possess as
much alcohol as their liver can
handle, provided they are 21 years
old or know someone who is.
The absence of resident
assistants is another reason many
students say they choose to live
in apartments. If you enjoy having
all of your friends over to your
apartment and drinking beer
while listening to your favorite
musical group at top volume,
there will be no RA to make you
stop. Your-neighbors may

complain, but, unlike RAs,
handing your neighbor a beer
may be enough to persuade him
or her to stop.

“The best part of living in an
apartment is that you can be as
loud as you want, and you can
destroy your apartment if you are
willing to lose your security
deposit, " saidjames Coghenhour,
a Dawson Street resident.

Although many students say
apartments are a more enjoyable
living situation, they are generally
farther away from campus. The

dorms are conveniently located
near classrooms, computer labs
and Hillman library, and this is
the advantage of on—campus
housing, say many students.

“If you live in the dorms and
you pick your classes right, you
don't even need an umbrella,”
said Patricia Hirsch of Amos Hall.

Another issue to consider in
making living arrangements is
safety. The safety of the dorms
versus the safety of off—campus

-housing is a debatable but
important consideration when

 

deciding where to live at school.
Pitt’s campus shuttle and
campus van make off—campus

living a little safer than it had 

been before, but students living

I on- and off—campus must both . '
worry about theft, robbery and .
the risk of personal injury from« C

attackers.

Whether you choose to live in v 1

a dorm or an apartment,
remember that since the best
apartments and dorms go quickly,

, it is important to start the search

early.

Eating patterns similiar no matter Where students live

By Catherine Goldstein
Sta_[)"W1-iler

Schenley Cafe, Second Plate,
Roy Rogers and the Towers
cafeteria are just some of the local
eateries most commonly
frequented by Pitt students.

First-year students who live in
the dorms are required to have a
meal plan ofeither 14 or 19 meals
a week.

Anyone else living in the
dormitories is required to have a
minimum of $250 worth of Choice
Dollars or choose to have a meal
plan, which can be for a smaller
amount.

According to Patti Verdi, school
nutritionist, students with meal
plans have a variety of foods to
choose from, but whether or not
they decide to eat in the cafeteria
is another story.

Sean Mosely also lives in his

He said he won’t cook because,
”It’s a pain to go out and buy the
food, and my refrigerator is so
small. The biggest pain is cleaning
the dishes and buying the pots
and pans. I usually eat at Schenley
or Dominos or go hungry because
of lack of funds.”

Verdi suggested that students
who live off-campus should eat
out as little as possible because
“even though it requires some
extra time, it’s healthier and
cheaper.

Students often eat on the run to
class or while they’re studying,
and this results in bad eating
habits.

It can effect cholesterol and
blood—pressure levels [and cause]
weight problems.

“It’s easy to prepare ' quick,
healthy meals, but it takes some
planning ahead,” Verdi said.

“Where there’s a will, there's a
way,” she said.

Commuter

By usa Tylak

Staff Writer

The Commuter Resource Center
at Pitt offers a new twist to the old

apartment search. for students. _
Instead‘ or pouring ‘over’ the ,

classifieds, students’ can look
through computerized listings of
apartments, separated into 16
speciﬁc categories.

The center has an estimated
1,500 to_2,000 apartments, and
rooms are listed by location and
whether or not they are furnished.
They also keep a “roommate-
matching file" divided into male,
female and coed categories.

“It's a pretty good setup,” said
Nathan I-Iorstman, a junior at Pitt.
"1 especially like the phones they
have there for you to use and the
categorization of apartments.”

The center, located on the first
floor of the William Pitt Union,
has been criticized for not
checking out the landlords listed
there. But according to Beth Anne
Pell, a representative of the center,
it does not have the ability to
check every landlord who places
a listing with them.

“They have to follow the codes
of the City of Pittsburgh. We’re
assuming they follow those
codes,” Pell said.

But some students say they
would like to know what they are
getting into when they rent from
a landlord they find through the
center.

“I think they should look into
the landlords around here and
pay more attention to who they
are going to endorse," said Scott
Bertani, a sophomore at Pitt.

To help students avoid bad
landlords, the center keeps a
record of complaints filed by

someone within 48 hours," David
B. Allen, supervisor of environ-

mental health, said.

If the problems in an apartment
do not create an emergency
situation the inspection will be
within 30 days. The Health
Department will also send a pre-
inspection notice to the landlord.
The landlord then has 24 hours to
correct any serious violations and
30 days to remedy other
infractions.

Often students don’t even
realize that there are problems in
their apartments. .

“The student population is not
that familiar with the construction
of buildings. If something seems
like it might be broken [the
student] should look into it," Allen

reported problems within the time
limit, the tenant is advised to
establish an escrow account

recognizes that.”

“You have to look at the situation from both
sides,” said Beth Anne Pell of the university’s
Commuter Resource Center, which handles off-
campus housing for’Pitt students.

“If four 18—year—olds want to move into this
big, old Victorian house, [the owner] has the
right to say, ‘No, thank you. I’m looking for
someone a little more mature,” Pell said.

Bad experiences with past undergraduate
tenants seem to have permanently marred the
relationship between many apartment -holders
and today's hopeful undergraduate renters.

“We’ve had too much trouble with them
causing damage and not paying rents,” said
Hope Hartman of Apartments Unlimited, a local

real-estate company that no longer rents to
undergraduates.
Randy Hillard is the vice—president of property

management for NDC Asset Management, which .

owns the Fairfax, Bates, Street and Webster Hall
apartment complexes.

“We prefer to rent to graduates," Hillard said.
“I think that graduates are more mature and
more adult-like, although that's not always the
case. We have very good luck with our students
there,” Hillard said.

There is a close, mutual dependence that
exists between local college students and real-
estate agencies, according to Hillard.

“If it wasn’t for the students in Oakland, a lot
of people in the business would be crying,”
Hillard said.

next year because South Oakland
is 'scummier than North

As far as Faight is concerned,
the ideal student to live in South
Oakland would be “a big football

Byjulie Sabol

News Assistant

Just a short walk through
Schenley Park brings you to
Squirrel Hill. You wonder how in
the world you could only be 20
minutes from the insanity of
Oakland.

The main reasons students
choose to live in Squirrel Hill,
commonly abbreviated as SQ Hill,

are because it is a quiet, safe area, .

yet at the same time it is accessible
to campus.

“It’s close enough to walk, and
it’s still a nicer area than Oakland,”
Rachele Kauffmann, a Pitt
graduate student, said.

Safety proved to be a major I

factor in making the choice to
live in Squirrel Hill. Many students
said it is worth the extra rent for
the sense of security you have.
“There's a lot less crime. Rent is a
little more, but it’s worth it,” Steve
Somerville, a Pitt graduate student,
said.

“I don’t have to worry about
safety here. The only time I have
to worry is walking home from
Oakland to SQ Hill,” Pitt student
Simeon Liebman said.

Cleanliness is another
difference people noted‘ when

‘ 'com’par‘ing'SQ'Hill to other areas.
~ “ "‘It-’s‘~ much ’cleaner'; -There ’ ‘aren't

as many cockroaches ‘in the
apartments as there are in

students about specific landlords.
The ﬁle goes back as far as 1986
and lists complaints ranging from
broken windows that were never
fixed to sexual assault by a
landlord. ‘

Bertani and his roommates ﬁled
a complaint with the center about
a sewage backup that persisted
for nine days, which they said
their landlord did not fix. They
are currently involved in a lawsuit
with that landlord.

The center also offers various
other services that many people
do not know about. ,

Students can borrow up to $300
through the Emergency Student
Loan ‘Program offered there. The
loans are available to all Pitt
students, provided they are
carrying at least six credits.

Michael Fekete, a student
employee at the center, said
‘students can use the money for
anything except paying tuition.

_“Normally they do not
discriminate ‘based on what your
reason may be —- whether you
need a haircut or books,” he said.

Students can also ﬁnd creative
living arrangements in apartment
buildings. Pitt sophomore Derek
Anderson accepted the job of

3 Single Residential Manager for a

reduction in rent, a paid phone’

bill and an hourly salary. He is, in '

civilian terms, the maintenance
man for a North Oakland
apartment building.

Anderson must put in 18 hours
of work per week during the
school year, but he can set his
own schedule. His tasks include
answering to tenants’ complaints
and ﬁxing anything that’s broken.

Anderson, who ‘has an
additional job, said he would
recommend his job to “people
who have to pay their own way
through college."

them, she advised.

If all else fails, “Good common

Scanlon said.

Eirene's clients need to have everything packed ahead of
time. “The more ready they are, the cheaper it is," he said.

South Hills Movers leaves the option of packing up to its
customers. _

It is willing to completely or partially pack boxes and cartons,
but some customers opt to pack for themselves. South Hills has
10 different carton sizes, but there are additional charges for
packing.

Its local rate per hour is based upon the number of people
sent on the job.

All distances under 40 miles from point of origin to point of
destination fall under the local rate, according to Bill Brack,
sales manager.

Move Express’ packing is more expensive — by the box.
Express also has a wide range of boxes, from $4 to $20 per box.
Usually Move Express sends a two-man crew to move into or
from an apartment.

The rate for this is $45 per hour with an additional travel fee
of $45. An additional crew member would boost the rates to $60
per hour.

ROTC decision outrageous

At yesterday’s Senate Council meeting, Pitt President].
Dennis O’Connor decided that ROTC will be allowed to
remain on campus. At present, the U.S. Department of
Defense policy excludes lesbian, gay and bisexual people
from military service. Although recognizing ROTC conflicts
with Pitt’s superficial commitment to non-discrirnination,
O’Connor justified his decision by saying, “I do not
believe the University of Pittsburgh should act alone on
this matter.”

As long as Pitt allows ROTC to remain on campus, it is
an accomplice to anti- gay discrimination. O’Connor forgets
that ROTC and the military policy hurts people.

At Carnegie Mellon University in November, a gay
ROTC cadet was forced out of the program. He lost his
scholarship. At Washington University, ex-ROTC cadet
James Holobaugh was not only kicked out, but he was
asked by the military to repay his scholarship. This sounds
like being spit in the face and then being asked to pay for
it. But even outside the ROTC, the anti-gay policy attacks
people on the basis of sexual orientation.

Threats against gay military personnel resemble torture.
Often a soldier is handcuffed, interrogated under bright
lights and asked to.identify other gays. People identified
as gay face investigationand potential discharge.

The DOD’s anti-gay policy has hundreds of casualties.
It is immoral that our university allows a discriminatory
organization, like ROTC, to have access to Pitt students.

While O’Connor has committed his word to work
against the anti-gay DOD policy, it is questionable
whether he or anyone else believes that without sufficient
leverage, universities will be successful.

Although legal challenges are mounting, the federal
judiciary has hesitated to overturn the policy. Contrary to
O’Connor’s assertion, many schools, including Harvard
and Yale, have removed ROTC programs. If any other
university organization had a written and enforced policy
mandating discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation,
Pitt would no doubt act quickly. Administration would
not seek to review the situation every year or allow the
group to maintain ajﬂoor. in the Cathedral of Learning.
ROTC should not garner any special privileges.

Demanding the removal of Pitt's ROTC is the best way
to ensure ROTC’s survival throughout theentire country.
Setting the courageous standard of removal puts significant
pressure on the DOD to change. By not acting to remove
ROTC, Pitt leaves students at schools without ROTC units
in limbo waiting for the DOD toact. .

In July 1991, Pitt’s University Senate recognized ROTC
programs as part of the university and in conflict with the
institution’s non—discrimination code. O’Connor realized
the conﬂict. The committee called for the ROTC unit to
comply with Pitt’s anti—discrirnination code or leave by
1997. It’s that simple.

Under O’Connor’s guidance, the University of Pittsburgh
community has compromised its integrity by allowing a
conspiracy of hate against lesbians, bisexuals and gay
men. '

Senator Fisher full of hot air

Sometimes I just don’t get it. Some things seem so
simple or insignificant, I don't understand how they
explode into huge debates.

Things like flag burning, holiday Creches and the
current PC debate are made to appear to be
critically important topics but turn out to be
temporary controversies that politicians squeeze
for publicity. Later, when the issue cools, it is either
resolved in the light of quiet

to practically every college and university in the
nation.

To start telling a university who it can allow to
use its facilities and what ideas it is allowed to
support is opening a Pandora's box of interference
from every frightened, narrow-minded, public
lackey who considers ignorance a point of pride.

Speaking of state Sen. Mike Fisher, we come to

the sad crux of this sorry little

common sense or simply
forgotten. ~

I can’t help but think that the
current argument about the law
school ban on military recruiting‘ ‘ ' ‘

  Mark


story. It seems to me that the
military really has no justifiable
reason for banning gays, lesbians

‘xx/i&1ii"tft.<§‘rl’gl‘lts to ban the military

is another issue that will
eventually be resolved quietly, after the publicity-
seeking politicians have found another meaningless
crisis to bemoan. If you have not noticed, the Pitt
Law School has banned the military from recruiting
in the law school because the military’s policy of
prohibiting gays, lesbians and bisexuals from
enlisting violates the school's commitment to non-
discrimination.

Now isn’t this shockingljust because the military
selects a group of U.S. citizens and decides to deny
them access to a public institution for no other
reason than being a member of that group, the law
school decides the policy is discriminatory. How
dare it?

The fact that there isn’t a better definition of
discrimination seems to be no reason to pick on the
poor old military. This is where I get lost. I just don’t
see a real controversy here. It seems the military is
clearly acting in support of discrimination. As a
public—supported institution, Pitt has an obligation
to promote equal protection under the law.

The Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution
not only grants protection to all its citizens, it grants
full legal participation to all its citizens. Gays,
lesbians and bisexuals are full legal citizens of the
United States, and they should not be denied legal
access to any U.S. institution or denied any legal
rights. If the military can ban homosexuals because
itdoesn’t like them, then it can also ban blacks,}ews
or people with bad teeth. I know the Supreme Court
has ruled differently, but its logic seems faulty and
based on emotions, and as a private citizen I have
a right to disagree.

Not only do I have a right to disagree, but so does
the law school. Pitt, contrary to popular opinion, is
a private institution. And as a private institution, it
does have a right to deny outside parties_the,._use of
university facilities. Remember, we are not talking
about banning ‘military, recruiters fromlcampus —
merely from one building on campus. 

Yes, Pitt does accept a lot of public funds, but that
does not give every hysterical vote-mongering
politician a right to interfere with the university's
decisions. If the acceptance of public funds is
grounds to interfere with an institution, then the
government has a right to dictate policy and practice

from recruiting in the law school.

But even if you disagree, it is hard to believe that
this single act in one building on one campus is
really that important. The military has the whole
rest of campus to use, and I suspect if it wants to
get in touch with the law students, it will find a way.
This is not a big deal, and in all likelihood, the U.S.
Armed Services will survive this act by the Pitt Law
School. But just in case,~.thank God we have state
Sen. Mike Fisher to defend the military’s honor.

Considering the insignilicance of this stand to
our nation’s military, it ishard to believe that Fisher
thinks this issue is so :.crucial it demands his
personal attention. It is -equally hard to believe,
considering the current_fiscal mess of this state, that
Fisher does not have anything better to do. So why
does he bother? '

Easy, it provides a chance to climb on a soapbox
and get a little media coverage, an irresistible
combination for most politicians. Fisher, by taking
on the pinko, liberal, egghead, pervert—protecting
university, is going to use this issue to show the
people back home what a square guy he is and get
a little air time as well.

His constituency is likely to eat it up. Nothing will
happen on campus, and two years from now no
one will even remember it happened. But in the
meantime good old Sen. Fisher will stir up as much
heat as he can while also avoiding any opportunity
for careful, reasoned discussion.

I don’t mind politicians going after someone or

some institution taking a principled stand. That is '

to be expected from the kind of people we elect.

What Ivdo find annoying is a demagogue taking on A I

narrow, triﬂing issues that appeal to the public’s
blind, emotional prejudices instead of confronting

genuine social issues that have broad ramifications. . ,

It is the Fishers of the world that scream bloody
murder over incidents like the law school ban and

disappear when issues involving gay-rights arise. ,

Maybe I am just getting too old, but I am awfully
tired of people like Sen. Fisher using some non-
event as an opportunity to waste our time and his
energy. -

Panthers regain momentum in Big Eastwith

, ugly loss at Boston College behind

them. '- -

That is how long it took them to
rolllout to a 10-0 lead against
Villanova last night. The Panthers
ledthe rest of the way and pulled
away late for a 77-68 win.

The victory lifts Pitt (15-9
overall, 7-4 in the Big East) into
second place in the conference.
The Wildcats fall to 8-12 overall,
5-6 in the Big East.

Ahmad Shareef led the early
charge. He opened the game with

. an alley~oop slam on a pass from

Sean Miller. Chris McNeal’s steal
and outlet pass set Shareefup for
a breakaway layup.

“lShareefl played very well,” Pitt
head coach Paul Evans said. “He
gave us a good lift at the start.”

The lead reached 10 on
consecutive three—pointers by
Orlando Antigua and Miller. Both
shots were from the wing, which
was open most of the night.
Villanova head coach Rollie
Massimino called a time out at
that point to stop the bleeding.

Villanova finally scored, as
senior forward Marc Dowdell was
fouled byi-Shareefrronia dunk
attempt and hit one of two free-
throw attempts. After an identical
effort byjunior forward Arron Bain
cut the lead to eight, Pitt stretched
it to 13 on a driving layupbyjerry
McCullough and Milleifi’s'ssecond
trey. -

I The lead was 17-4 with 10:50
remaining in the half before the
Wildcats scored their first ﬁeld
goal, a three-point shot by senior

JII

on a three-pointer by Ghandi
Jordan, but Villanova crept right
back into the game with an eight—
point run capped by a three— point
shot from senior guard Chris
Walker with 6:17 remaining.

gone. Centerjames Bryson scored
on a goaltending call against Eric
Mobley to make the halftime score
31-29. Those two players were

keys to the game.

Bryson more than anybody kept
Villanova close in the first half
with eight points and three boards.
He ended up with 14 points and
nine rebounds. '

_ Mobleyhadfour points and two
rebounds at the half, but he was
on his way to a career night. Isle
set career highs in points with 15
and rebounds with nine in
addition to three blocked shots.
He even hit nine of]/I free throws.

“ Mobley agreed it was his best

game of the season — especially
the free throws.

“I feel real good about [free-
throw shooting],” Mobley said.
“l’I'he way he played] feels real
good. I just wanted to prove to
everybody that I can play. A lot of
people said that I’m out of shape.
I can play as long as [Evans] wants
me to play."

Evans said he probably won’t
play M obley“much more than he
did because Mobley is still limited
by his conditioning.

“A lot of the people in the stands
who booed in the stands when he
came out didn't understand that
he wanted to come out,” Evans
said. “He has trouble going more
than six or seven minutes [at a
time].”

Hocleey club jets past Roe/eets; gets de-iced by Mountaineers

By J ohn Labriola
saw‘ ivruer

The Pitt hockey team split last
weekend by defeating the Rockets
of Slippery Rock University 94
on Saturday in Meadville and
being defeated by the
Mountaineers of West Virginia
University 4-3 on Sunday in
Monroeville.

Sunday's competition started
exactly at S p.m. at Golden Mile
Ice Center. Normally the
competitions begin at 5:15 p.m.,
which allows time for the ice to
be cleaned, but the Zamboni was
broken. During the course of the
competition ice shavings built up
to be a nice layer of snow. Because
of this snow buildup, the pace of
the game was slower.

' Although both teams played
under the same conditions, the
Panthers suffered more than the
Mountaineers because Pitt’s team
is a faster—skating squad.

“The ice blew,” Koval said,
“but they played on the same ice
that we did and there’s no one to

blame but ourselves.”

As always when Pitt and WVU
get together, the audience
witnessed more of the type of
skating displayed by Team USA
than that of the Philadelphia
Flyers. The Pitt-WVU game was
one of passing and setting up
shots rather than the check-them-
for-all-they-are-worth variety.

During the better half of the
first period, both teams set up for
goals. But both tearns' goaltenders
were extremely talented West
Virginia finally took control of
the game at the 9:13 mark by
netting its first goal. The
Mountaineers followed up three
minutes later with their second
goal of the evening as well as the
last goal of the first period.

The second period began much
like the first, but this time WVU
scored two minutes into play.
The Panthers were able to hold
the Mountaineers from netting
any additional goals, but they
were unable to set themselves up
for a goal of their own.

At the 14:51 mark. the

Mountaineers dumped the puck
into the Panthers’ goal for the
fourth time and closed out the
scoring for the second period at
4-0.

During the third period the
Panthers did an impersonation af
Lazarus and came back from the
dead. Pitt began to skate a little
faster (as fast as the ice conditions
would allow) and set up their
shots a little more carefully.

“I wanted us to send them a
message in the third period,"
Koval said. “If we didn’t come
back and score four, I wanted to
score a couple and let West
Virginia know that we didn't play
the first two periods.”

At the 2:24 mark the Panthers
netted their first goal of the
evening. Vic DiSanti dumped the
puck into WVU’s net off a pass
set up by Scott Giordano and
Koval.

After scoring its first goal, Pitt
did not rest on its laurels. The
Panthers decided to set up for
another goal. Five minutes later
the Panthers’ hard work and

diligence earned them another
goal, netted at the 9:53 mark by
Giordano. Giordano was assisted
by Bill Crousey and DiSanti.

The Panthers continued to skate
with a newly found goal. They
continued to set up their shots
and execute them with more care.
Finally, at the 14:32 mark, Koval
dumped the puck past the WVU
goaltender to net the Panthers’
third and final goal of the
competition, closing the game at
4-3.

On Saturday the Panthers took
on the goon squad of Slippery
Rock University. As always the
Rockets kept true to form and
played extremely offensively.

Over the last four years, SRU’s
skating style has not changed.
The Rockets go to the body
frequently and distribute dirty
checks. Their adage of “when in
doubt, take him out” seemed to
be in full swing during Saturday’s
competition.

Slippery Rock took 16 penalties
for a total of 45 minutes. Out of
those penalties the Rockets

Koval summed up Saturday's
competition without mixing
words.

‘Slippery Rock is a total goon
squad,” Koval said. ‘They're
hatchet men, and they shouldn't
be on the ice with us. And I'm just
glad that we got out of there

In spite of aura, ‘The Great One’ giving Way to new talent

It’s amazing to me when I watch
an NHL game involving the Los
Angeles Kings. You’d swear the
only person ever mentioned by
the announcers is Wayne Gretzky.

An example that comes to mind
is a game a few months ago
involving the Kings and
Pittsburgh. Gretzky assisted on a
shorthanded goal by Charlie
Huddy. All the announcers could
do was talk on and on about how

, F 5l.'~ll. 3‘,

great a pass it was. (It really
wasn't that great. It was a two-on-
one, and practically any NHL
player could have made the pass.)
I later watched the game
highlights on ESPN. They showed
a replay of the goal and neglected
to mention who scored it. All
they could say was, “And look at
the great pass by ‘The Great One’
to set up the goal.” They gave no
credit whatsoever to the player

It’s also pathetic to hear the
announcers continually calling
Gretzky “The Great One.’,’ Gretzky
may be thebest player of all time
and he certainly was great in the

early to iii 250$ btlﬁ that time is —‘

history. Hisgoal-scoring ability is

novif littl,e_bIe‘tter than average, 

while his passing skillshav'e"b’e'cjn

Lemieux and Adam Oates.’

Gretzky in the. early to mid ’80s
may have been “great,” but now
he should be referred to as “The

f Good One’? or “The Better Than
‘Average One]? His time is done.
 It’s.time for people to appreciate

more the players in the NHL like
Lemieux, Brett Hull, Joe Sakic
and Pat LaFontaine, who are truly
the current “Great Ones.”

V -Andythe ,continui_ng_ saga of

that great comedy act, NHL
officiating, continues. I read that
referee Andy van Hellemond
criticized Mario Lemieux and the
comments he made about referee
Ron Hoggarth in a recent Sports
Illustrated. van Hellemond said

of the suspension of Jaromirjagr, '
“That’s not a judgement call; it’s .
gj fighters‘ to protect -them. Wayne

He went on to say about Lemieux,
“If you're making $2 million a
year,.you should know the rule

they are going to trade Paul Coffey
or anybody else, one type of
player they should get in return is
an enforcer, or goon. The physical
abuse that Mario Lemieux and
Mark Recchi put up with is
unbelievable. Opponents take
