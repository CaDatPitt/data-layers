Forum Hears Ezekiel
Urge National Planning

Speaker At Monday’s Forum Insists That Govcrnrn.ent
Planned Society Must Replace Monopoly Control

Of Economic System

By Robert Adams

National economic planning, direct-
ed and carried out by the government,
is an absolute necessity in" the United
States today. .

That is the opinion presented to
students at Inquiry Forum Monday
by Dr. Mordecai Ezekiel, economic ad-
visor to the secretary of agriculture,
in his address on the subject “If Plan-
ning, What Kind?”

Under our present economic system,
Dr. Ezekiel declared, “There is no
alternative between a planned and an
unplanned society, for our society
now operates as the result of plan-
ning.” Still there is an alternative,
he pointed out, between private and
government economic planning.

Development of today’s economic
structure, Dr. Ezekiel said, has come
as an outgrowth of the free compe-

tition which was rampant while capi-
talism was getting its start. But free
competition, with its “terriﬁc degra-
dation of labor,” has lapsed into reg-
ulation of businesses by corporations,
trusts, labor unions, tariffs, and gov-
ernment agencies.

Economic planning by the govern-
ment can exist under our present sys-
tem of “free” government, Dr. Eze-
kiel declared. The necessary change
may be accomplished, he said, by re-
placing the regulation now performed
by industry itself by an organized
system of national planning carried
out by “a government which sees the
general welfare strongly enough to
substitute national plans for individ-
ual plans.” -

In the period between 1880 and
1930, he pointed out, the output per

Young Syrnphony Member
Describes Associates’
Queer Mannerisms

 

By Robert Brown

Great musical artists sometimes act
a bit peculiar, but they’re still human,
according to Denton Beal, C39, young-
est member of the Pittsburgh Sym-
phony. Beal, whose father, Dr. George
D. Beal, is assistant director of Mel-
lon Institute, has played bassoon in
the orchestra for a period of three
years, and is also active in musical
groups on campus.

Most of the visiting artists, al-
though not exactly “queer,” have lit-
tle mannerisms that they believe will
help them in their work, he states.
Helen Jepson, one of the chief so-
pranos in the Metropolitan Opera, al-
ways travels with a pet rabbit. Com-
plete with pink eyes and fur, he

signed wicker suitcase while Miss
Jepson sings Faust out front before

. .Ai Student Hope
TOMORROW MORNING students at colleges
., and ‘universities throughout the entire coun-
try will take part simultaneously in a “strike
against war.” At the same time, students atthe
University will _attend a “peace assembly,” spon-
sored by the -"Pitt Peace Council and SFA. ‘

“ Judged by previous performance, tomorrow’s
meeting should‘ be expected to follow the regular
stereotyped "course. One would expect to hear the_

same eloquent yet sincere exhortations in behalf"

of peace, the same momentary spark of mass emo-
tion,-- and the same quick extinction of the spark,
not to be rekindled until the next spring.

‘But in the last several months, circumstances
have arisen ‘on ‘the. campus, which, if’ taken ad-
vantage of‘-properly, may produce an entirely dif-
ferent and more lastingreaction. At the begin-_
ning of the‘ semester, anew campus organization,
the Pitt Peace Council, was born. Since that time,
this group representing many widely-divergent

campus interests, has sponsored assemblies, and .

carried out scattered; projects, as the beginning
of its proposed _.plan for peace education among
students. Although the council, thus far, has not
lived‘ up to all expectations, it has made a start
towards a continuous program of peace action at
the University, and has done far more than has
anycther previous organization. ‘

" Climax of the_organization’s efforts so far. will
come tomorrow, at Memorial Hall at the Peace

Day assembly- Notwithstanding the fact that —

some students have felt that a more militant dem-
onstration in the form of a strike would be more
effective, there is little to substantiate such an
opinion. ‘Essentially, -it makes little difference
whether it be a strike or an assembly. Either, at

its best, produces" only a temporary reaction._

There must be some way to follow up anygains
that mayhave been made by such a demonstra-
tion. »

With a functioning peace council organized,
prospects for “follow up” work are much bright-
er this -year.’ The normal college student is op-
posed to war. But he also must be constantly
prodded to action,,not only for an hour a year,
but constantly between times, to keep him inter-
ested and informed on the topic of peace.

‘ If wise, the Peace Council will not consider the
assembly a crowning achievement of its short his-
tory, but will view it as a strong link in an end-
less chain of positive and const_ructive activity,
destined to keep the problem of peace uppermost

‘in: the minds of the University students.——J. M.

To Act As Guides ‘
At Newqlnstitute

 

The task of receiving several thou-
sand I visitors and piloting them
through _the new Mellon Institute
building during it.s.dcdication exer-
cises, May 5 to 9, has been entrusted
to the research ‘scientists of the Insti-
tute’s staff, who have organized them-
selves into committees to take care
of all arrangements.

Dr. Edward R. Weidlein, director
of the Institute, said that this essen-
tial work will be attended to by the
membership of the R. K. D. Club,
made up of Fellows of the Institute’s
research organization. The -club is the
center of the social activities of the
researchers, and was named in honor
of Robert Kennedy Duncan, who con-
ceived the fundamentals of the Insti-
tute’s research procedure.

Elaborate plans are being made for
the guiding of visitors through ‘the
building on special days in a way
which will enable them to see every-
thing that may interest them ‘and t
visit all _departments. 5 -

worker in this country has more than
doubled. “Increased output in all
phases of industry,” he added, “should
mean rapidly rising standards of liv-
ing. If wages rise without a corre-
sponding price increase, workers can
bu_y more.” , ' '

But ‘events did not turn out that
way, Dr. Ezekiel recounted. Of the
total wealth increase made by Ameri-
can businesses between 1923 and 1929,
only one-fourth was devoted to wage
increases, b u t three-fourtlis was
turned into larger dividends and in-
creased capital investments, he stated.

“Because wages remained compara-
tively low while prices were high,”
he continued, “businesses found them-
selves with a restr-ictedinarket. That
was one cause for the last depression.
And it seems that our industries are
going to do ‘the same thing again if
they get a chance.”"‘ '

friend from Carnegie Tech- let the an-
imal out of its cage ‘-where it hopped
around among the dusty music stands
and frayed curtains,’ but “it didn’t
cause any trouble. at all." ..

“Most of the 'vi_siti_ng pianists are
extremely sensitive about the condi-
tions of their hands,” remarked Beal.
“Just -before they make their ‘stage
entrance they dip their hands into a
little pan 0f.‘liot water so that it will
loosen up ‘the joints. However Rach-
maninoff did away with this in his
appearance with us this year, he just
walked gout and _- played.” '

Josef Hofman, the dean of pianists,
uses a specially designed collapsible
stool" and an_{ individualistic sort of
keyboard, much sliorter than ‘the
usual size, because of his short, stub-

Beal stated that the orchestra mem-
bers always have to get used to the
different methods which guest con-
ductors use to conduct the orchestra.
“Georges Enesco did a lot of his con-

Waikiki Wedding

iPerhaps I shouldn’t.»sa_v anything
about “Waikiki Wedding,” the Cros-
by picture at the ‘Penn. You see, the
theatre was hot and stuffy and Ha-
waiian guitars always make me sleepy
anyway. But a column’s a column so
I'll have to dish out something.

“Waikiki Wedding” is a moving
picture. It is laid in Hawaii, of all
places. As usual, it has a plot which
I missed because I came in ﬁve inin—
utes late. I don’t think the plot was
of any great social signiﬁcance, how-
ever, so we can skip it and go on to
the cast.

Bing Crosby heads the list. He's a

soft-spoken press-agent who getsideas‘

while lounging on a small yacht. Be-
sides getting ideas Bing gets along
wel-l~ with-«the ~-natives--and sighs -at
least three times._ Bob Burns is also
on the yacht but instead of getting
ideas he gets in jail. The other princi-
pals are two women and a . ., . ‘The

“Top of The Town” Not
So High

“Top Of The Town,” at the Alvin.
is Cap and Gown gone bigtime, which
is one way of saying that it has
something, but not a hell of a lot.
“Top Of The Town” is a very lavish
production. It’s full of chromium and
switchboards and ﬂashing lights and
elevators.

There are several good songs in the
picture, among them the title song.
and another called “Where Are You."
The plot, however, furnishes a poor
excuse for all the singing and danc-
ing. I't’s about an heiress who has a
few novel ideas on the subject of
night clubs. This heiress, besides hav-
ing loads of money, a mean shape, and
her novel ideas, has a very amiable
disposition. It’s only fair. . . '

‘ Another new outdoor sport has ap‘
peared on the horizon. It was 01'lSl'
nated on the northern tour the Band
took last week. We haven’t attempt-
ed ‘to give‘ it a name, but it sounds
interesting.

‘and foy obvious A reasons -the first

bus had to '.in§‘ugu§'§te the. Same-
'John S'h'ir,le'y,_, student director, was,
"so to speak, the goat. Three or four
‘of the boys, among them Charley

‘now a better bowler; conceived the
‘idea and wrote the rules -of the
;game.  I .

drove off leaving not only the goat,
but also the goat-keepers.

(Note: we have decided to omit’
gny pm“ which might involve a
shaggy bearded anirnal and Q for-
mer néshk liar.) ,  v

The second bus drove up soon after.
but co_ntinued on without stopping
until it hadftopped 'a little rise in the
road about half a 'mile further on. Of

history to the meet. That this Pitt
team is to be reckoned with was best

made up of Woodruff, Leggin, Thom-
as, Tost, Mason, Spitz, Routch, Lasky,
and Cooper. Freshman Ferrara, Mc-
Cowan, Ohl, and McKee» are entered‘
also.

Coach Olson" hasn’t fully deter-
mined the composition of his relay
teams yet, but after this week’s prac-
tice; in baton passing he _.will have his
selections made. The four individuals
to compete are certain, however."I,‘hey
are upon invitation. P" -

fend his_ title. He’ll have to do over

His winning toss last year was not,
quite that far, but he has exceeded

race, will be in the high hurdles event.
Ryden ran the distancein “15 seconds

tition he’ll be matched with Forest

thick juicy steak smothered in mushrooms-
Lou’s favorite dish. Gehrig is a big man—6 ft.
1 in. tall—weighs 210 pounds. Andhe has a I
big man’s appetite. Lou eats what he wants
and isn’t bashful about coming back for "sec-
onds.” So for smoking Camels at mealtime and
afterward, you have Lou's own words: “I’vc
found that smoking Camels and eating go
together naturally.” Choose Camels for your
cigarette and see how they help to ease tension,
paving the way to good digestion. Smoking
Camels at mealtime and afterward speeds up
the flow of digestive ﬂuids. Alkalinity also is
increased. Thus Camels give you a delightful
sense of ‘well-being . . . they set you right!
Smokers find that they can enjoy Camels.
steadily— between meals as well as at meals
—aud that Camels never get on their nerves.

“‘Youth, How Can We_'_"Rationaliz4e

Peace?”

Stark, who ranks as one of the Uni-’ 3 P 7'"

versity’s outstanding speakers, has
gained most of his platform experi-_
ence as a member of the school’s dc-A
bating team. He is also on the editor-
ial board of The Pitt News, a member
of Druids and John Marshall, prelegal
l1ono1'a1;y_-of the University. -
Just-‘two weeks ago, he 'serv,cd.as
speaker‘ of the 4th Annual Ii1_tercol-

legiate Conference on Government at 

Harrisburg. During ‘this season he lias

" been chairman of the Concert Hours

and Book Chats Committee of SFA.
Stark will culminate his junior year
as chairman of the Tap Day festivi-

ties.
' 3The demonstration tomorrow will

be the fourth coiiceited anti-war ac-
tion held on the caiiipusesof America,
and is sponsored nationally by the
United Student l‘eace’Committee. In

1934, the ﬁrst year of the mass dem-'

onstration, the number of students
participating totaled 175,000. Last

 year the number increased to a half

million. From all indications, tomor-
row’s peace rally should draw over
one million students to the “assemblies

out the_,_country. 

Adorning the walls of Memorial

’ ‘Hall, will be a group of posters viv-

idly portraying the role of peace as

“opposed to ‘war. The posters were"

done "by the -‘art’-class'es of the Uni-
