Low turnout for concert

By Anthony Breznican
Staff Writer r ’

An all-day concert was held Saturday in
the auditorium of Bellefield Hall to raise
money for Kevin Cecil, the Pitt student
who was shot and paralyzed last summer in
front of Webster Hall after walking a
friend home.

Attendance was low at the event, howev-
er, and the expected finanical goal was not
reached.

Few tickets had been sold before the con-
cert began, but organizers and volunteers
were hopeful that many people would show
up at the door.

“We only need to draw about 100 people
to cover costs,” said Michelle Bryson, one
of the head organizers of the concert.
“Almost everything we have here has been
donated. Everybody here is doing this for
free. They’re doing it for Kevin.”

Bryson was characterized as a “godsend”
by both Katie Delaney and Adam Butera of
the Kevin Cecil Benefit Fund Committee.

“We couldn’t have done all of this with-

out her,” Delaney said.

A much larger crowd than 100 was
expected as the concert began.

“We’re hoping‘ to seat as many people as
possible,” said Adam Butera, co-chair of
the committee, prior to the concert. “The
hall will hold as many as a thousand peo-
ple. But overall, we’re hoping to see about
500 or 600 people turn out.”

Unfortunately only a little over 100 peo-
ple showed up for the concert during its 3-
11:00 p.m. run.

“Over 100 tickets were sold, plus contri-
butions,” said Betsy Sallade-Farina, head
of Food Services for the university and one
of the other chief organizers of the concert.
“[The concert] was not hugely profitable,
but it was financially successful.”

The money raised at the concert.will go
toward a fund set up to purchase a special
van that would allow Kevin to be more
easily transported from his home. Kevin
has been homebound since leaving the hos-
pital over two months ago.

India bus
crash kills

travellers

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

Pittsburgher Jack Wilson
and four college students
were in the midst of the trip
of a lifetime when it cost
them their lives last week.

A‘ bus carrying 29 people
traveling to India’s Taj Mahal
through Pitt’s Semester at
Sea program rolled off the
road last Wednesday night,
killing seven people on
board. The four students who
died were not Pitt students,
but Wilson, 65, was a long-
time supporter of the univer-
sity. ‘

His wife Teresa, the adult
director of Semester at Sea,
was also on the bus, sitting
next to her husband. She suf-
fered mild injuries.

“In my 25 years with the

program, we have never had
an accident of this magni-
tude,” said John Tymitz,
Semester at Sea’s executive
director.

The bus was about 20
miles outside of Agra, India,
where the Taj Mahal is locat-
ed. Tymitz said the bus tum-
bled off the side of the road
and hit a ditch. He left for
New Delhi on Thursday to be
with the families of the vic-
tims, also on their way to
India.

The bus driver and tour
guide, both Indian nationals,
died in the crash, along with
Wilson and the four students

tions, a catalyst to meditations upon “the big questions.”

For The Pitt News

Barry Lopez still possesses a book which was given to him as a
child, in which he underlined with ballpoint pen all the words he
knew in the text — “the,” “a” and the verbs “seeing” and “going.”
Thus was his future as a writer and traveller early revealed.

Lopez, a distinguished naturalist and author, spoke Monday
night at the Three Rivers Lecture Series about his life and work.

From Kenya to the high Arctic, he has travelled in “remote and
wild landscapes.” Although he has usually been in the company
of scientists, Lopez said his expertise lies in revealing that there is
“more to the Aurora Borealis than physics, more to the grizzly

As he phrased them, “What is the relationship of the individual
to God? What isthe relationship of the individual to the state?
How does one achieve a worthy life?”

Interestingly, Lopez contended that it is a curiously American
sensibility which is inspired, he said, “by the particular and pro-
voking landscapes such as the land-bound ocean of the Nebraska
Plains, the Salinas Valley, the Kentucky River Valley — these
kinds of spaces and their measures of time, are peculiar, I think, to
the American psyche.”

Literature, said Lopez, is the bridge between the exterior and
interior spaces.

As one might expect from a naturalist and author. Lopez

Katie Delaney. “He’s been
in his house for two months
since [leaving the hospital].
This [van] should give him
a little bit of independence
 we’re getting the van at
costfor $26,000, but it will
cost $30,000 more to make
renovations so that Kevin
can ride in it. We hope to
make at least some of that
money here.”

Over 80 volunteers and 10
different bands and per-
forming acts donated their
time to raise money for
Kevin. Food and the use of
the hall was also donated
for the concert.

“It’s a big morale booster
for Kevin to see so many
people out here trying to
help him,” Delaney said.

Kevin Cecil made a rare
appearance at the concert.
He was not available for
comment, but Delaney said
that he was very happy to
be there.

“It’s good for him to get
out. He looks much better
today compared to a few
weeks ago,” Delaney said.
“They had to rent a van to
get him here, though, and
that gets expensive. That’s
why we want to get him a
van of his own.”

Delaney said that seeing
Kevin was a morale booster
for his friends, too.

“I’ve noticed such a dif-
ference in his spirit, and he
has such a good sense of
humor about things,”
Delaney said. “He keeps
everybody else going.”

Despite the disappointing
turnout, the organizers and
volunteers at the event were
praised by John Callahan,
also co-chair of the fund
committee, and by Interim-
Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg.

“It is a wonderful thing to

‘ see that what really was a

senseless violent act can
produce such a result as this
[concert], which really
reflects the best of the
human spirit,” Nordeneberg
said.

John Callahan praised
those who did turn out for
the show and all the volun-
teers who donated and
helped with the event.

“I’d like to thank every-
body who’s here or who has
ever helped with this event
and the Kevin Cecil Fund,”
Callahan said. “Kevin is an
inspiration to us all: No
matter what hand God deals
us, we can take it and make
the most of it.”

Opinions
Striking bill approved

Last Thursday, Congress and the president finally met on
middle ground by approving the presidential line-item veto.
This is truly a landmark event, since the Republican-controlled
Congress and the Democrat White House have had little to
agree on since they came into office. Just how far apart they
usually are can be seen by how long it took to pass the line-
item veto; it was one of President Clinton’s campaign promis-
es and a part of the Republican Contract with America. Both
parties wanted the bill, but it took almost two years for
Congress to relinquish some of its lawmaking power to the
president. But as of July 1 of this year, Congress will do just
that.

Thousands of bills are introduced into Congress every year.
You might remember from the elementary school cartoon
“How a Bill Becomes a Law” that each bill has to be
approved, voted on, amended, approved again, et cetera. Every
time a bill is amended, it usually gets one or two riders
attached to it to make it more agreeable to everyone. Even if a
congressman doesn’t like a specific bill, he or she can attach a
rider clause to it to make the whole thing more palatable.
Sometimes this kind of congressional artistry can lead to a bill
which has one little clause tacked on to it which will cause the
entire bill to be vetoed by the president.

Especially in the past two years, this kind of thing has run
rampant. President Clinton exercised his veto power more
times than most people can count, in many instances because
of a rider clause. For example, the recent welfare-reform bill
that made it to Clinton’s desk was never passed, even though
the president said he liked a majority of the bill. He vetoed the
whole bill because he thought the Medicaid cuts were too
drastic, so the whole bill was lost. Though they have seen

A many of their pet projects (like welfare reform) vetoed by the

president, the members of the Republican Congress still saw
the value of the line-item veto.

Opponents of the line-item veto argue that it is unconstitu-
tional, since the president will have the ability to sign laws
that were not technically approved by Congress. The president
will be able to strike out the clauses he does not like but still
sign the other parts of the bill into law. In a literal sense, the
opponents of the bill are correct; the president does not have to
sign the bill as it is when he receives it. However, the parts of
a bill left after the line-item veto is exercised will have been
approved by Congress. The line-item veto does not allow the
president to write his own clauses, only to strike out existing
ones. Even once the veto is exercised, Congress can still over-
ride it, like any other veto, with a two-thirds majority vote.

Hopefully, the line-item veto will allow important legislation
to become law, without the frequently outlandish and some-
times irrelevant riders blocking their passage.

Isolate the part—time candidates

During presidential elections,
candidates with little chance of
winning typically take wild
stances on the issues in an effort
to win support from important
voting blocs. This sort of des-
peration is evident from the dis-
turbingly protectionist rhetoric
being espoused by candidate
Pat Buchanan in an effort to win
votes from voters disaffected by
economic change.

Buchanan has seized upon
President Clinton’s bailout of
the Mexican economy last year
as a campaign issue in an effort
to bolster his flagging cam-
paign. To hammer home his
“America First” it-heme,
Buchanan constantly repeats
this statement to voters every-
where at every opportunity:
“Why did we send [Mexico]
$50 billion? Because the bonds
were coming due, my friends!
So we got the New York
bankers — Citibank, Chase
Manhattan and Goldman, Sachs
— off the hook. But guess
who's on the hook? You and
your grandchildren!”

Is Buchanan’s statement true?
Did the United States “send”
Mexico $50 billion in cash?
Certainly not. Of the 50 billion
Buchanan was referring to, 12
billion comes from Japan,
Europe, Latin America and
Canada. Another 18 billion
comes from the International
Monetary Fund.

In _reality, we actually have
“sent” Mexico about 20 billion,
far less than the 50 billion
Buchanan talks about. In his
speeches, Buchanan implies
that President Clinton sat down
and wrote a check for 50 billion
to the Mexican government
without any strings attached,
which is very wrong. The
United States is lending this
money with interest. In the long
run, the Mexico loans won’t
cost the American people a
dime.

Also, Buchanan neglected to
mention that the Mexican gov-
emment has recently repaid the
first installment of the loan

Michael
Berquist

ahead of schedule. In the event
that the Mexican government
cannot repay the loans, it must
put up its highly valuable oil
reserves as collateral. This has
led Buchanan’s Mexican coun-
terparts to moan about the “sur-
rendering” of Mexican sover-
eignty to the United States.
Buchanan callously responds to
the charges of being a protec-
tionist by retorting, “I plead
guilty to trying to protect the
American worker.”

Rather than reject Buchanan’s
isolationist rhetoric, his fellow
Republicans have done their
best to court Buchanan voters
by embracing the fundamental
ideas behind his rhetoric, even
while they decry his protection-
ism. Recently, Senator and
Republican presidential nomi-
nee Bob Dole, once a consistent
free trade advocate until he
began to kowtow to right-wing
voters, rejected the idea of
adding Chile to the NAFTA
agreement, explaining that
America is “choking” on free
trade agreements.

Some people have argued that
America is still an international-
ist nation committed to protect-
ing freedom abroad, citing such
examples as a recent poll that
says two-thirds of the American
people want the U.S. to play an
“active role” in foreign affairs.
Unfortunately, while the public
might echo this ideal in spirit, it
is unwilling tomake sacrifices
necessary to achieve this goal.

Another recent poll says that
a majority of Americans feel
that we should withdraw from
the NAFTA agreement, despite
no evidence that it has caused
any harm to the United States
(alarmingly enough, two-fifths
of Republican voters have
called Buchanan’s solutions the
“right ones” for America).
Sixty-five percent of the
American public feels that we
should tax imported goods in an
effort to protect the jobs and

wages of American workers.
Stanford economist Paul
Krugman debunked this sort of
thinking by pointing out that
barriers to trade typically boost
prices within the very markets
they seek to protect, give con-
sumers fewer choices and
weaken the world economy.

The historical precedent
against protectionism is persua-
sive: In 1929 the United States
imported about $6 billion of
products. Thanks to the Smoot-
Hawley tariff, which was
intended to shield America’s
economy from the weaknesses
exposed by the stock market
crash of 1929, imports fell to
just $2 billion three years later
in 1932. In retaliation, European
markets increased tariffs, slow-
ing American exporting from
$7 billion to $2.4 billion during
the same time period.
Unsurprisingly, unemployment
skyrocketed from 3.3 percent in
1929 to a stunning 25 percent.
America’s GDP was sliced in
half. As both sides raised tariffs
back and forth, the world econ-
omy collapsed.

Today, too many American
jobs depend upon free trade. An
estimated 770,000 American
jobs depend upon export to
Mexico alone. One in six jobs
in the United States depend
upon exports. To seal our bor-
ders as Buchanan and his naive
supporters advocate would be
crazy. It would do little more
than wreck our own economy
and stagnate the economies of
countries that trade with us. The
ripple effect would succeed in
doing just what Buchanan is
trying to prevent: destroying
America’s fragile economy,
much like the Smoot-Hawley
tariff did over 60 years ago.
Buchanan and his supporters
ought to think their decisions
through carefully before they
make the decision which may
feel good to make but which
may also have repercussions.

Vassil is
coming
to visit

 

Columnist
Mike
Kovak

memo to Ralph

Willard: sign the

Bulgarian badass
Vassil Evtimov pronto.

Yesterday at the
McDonald’s High School
All-American game,
Evtimov wasn’t flashy —— he
just simply had the best all-
around game of anybody on
the court. Listen to these
statistics: 19 minutes, 14
points, a game-high 11
rebounds, three steals, three
assists and one block.

It’s also important to note
that the Bulgarian badass
played center for the bulk of
those 19 minutes. He's 6-
foot-9 and went up against
two 7-footers.

Evtimov will add much
needed muscle to the Pitt
front line. \

Oh boy, it’s happening
again. Visions, good
visions, pretty visions,
visions of grandeur.

Picture this, if you will:
next season, opening night
at a sold-out and rockin’
Fitzgerald Field House. The
starting lineups are intro-
duced, and out trots
Evtimov to the uproarious
cheers of a crazed crowd.

Oh boy! With Evtimov
destined to. be a star, what a
better place to shine than in
the Big East, right?

If Pitt were to sign him,
that would move Pitt’s num-
ber one star, Chad Varga, to
his natural position, small
forward. That would give
Varga the chance to move
around in the set offenses a
little more and to continue
shooting 3-pointers, an area
in which the big guy greatly
improved this past season.

The signing of Evtimov
should also be music to cen-
ter Mark Blount’s ears.
There’s no question that
Blount’s game improved
gradually over the course of
the season. He started
blocking shots, shooting
jumpers and playing hard-
nosed defense. Next year,

five Big East conference meet-
ings.

“Anytime you don’t win two
out of three at home, it’s very
disappointing, especially in the
Big East,” said pitcher Kevin
Kramer. “St. John’s wasn’t
overwhelming. We could have
easily swept them.”

In the first game of a double-
header on Saturday, the

Rohrbach pitched a complete
game, giving up only six hits
and surrendering one walk. But
the Panthers failed to put up
any runs in a 2-0 loss.

St. John’s got out to an early
1-0 lead in the top of the first.
Red Storm shortstop Giancarlo
Diprima singled, and Keith
Finnerty advanced to second on
an error by Pitt second baseman

Mushom grounded to second,
but Melucci committed his sec-
ond error of the inning and
Diprima scored.

The score remained l-O until
the fourth. Mushom led off the
inning with a single and
advanced to second on a sacri-
fice by Brian Fitzsimmons.
Mushom moved over to third
on a sacrifice fly to right by
Red Storm DH John
Aramento and scored on a
two-out single by
Anthony D’Esposito.

St. John’s starting
pitcher Derek Adair sti-
fled Pitt hitters all day,
giving up six hits and
walking four. The
Panthers threatened to put
a dent in the Red Storm
lead in the bottom half of
the fourth.

After Bill Derr ground-
ed out, Steve Dickinson
and Kevin Knox produced
back—to—back singles.
Melucci laid a bunt down
the third base line and
advanced the runners to
second and third. With
two down, St. John’s
decided to intentionally
walk Jason Conti to get to
Kurt Womelsdorf. This
strategy proved success-
ful, as Womelsdorf
popped up to second to

Country's top prepsfers shine at Civic Arena

By Sean Duncan
Managing Editor

Despite the nice weather last
weekend, the skies were gray
for the Pitt baseball team as it
dropped two out of three games
to the visiting St. John’s Red
Storm. The Panthers fell to 15-
10-1 overall, 2-5 in Big East
play.

After opening the season
with a 13-4-1 record, the

,2

  

Shaheen Hol1oway’s options were limitless.
Heading a 4-on-2 fast break with a player streaking
from each side, Holloway opted for the between-the-
legs drop pass to a thundering Vassil Evtimov, who
scooped up the ball and threw down a lefty jackham-
mer right in Lester Earl’s mug.

Evtimov’s slam was just one of 31 dunks dis-
played in yesterday’s 19th annual McDonald’s High
School All-American Game, where the East easily
beat the West all-stars 120-105 at the Civic Arena.

“In this type of game, I know I have a lot of great
players, so I wasn’t out there to show my stuff. I was

just out there to have fun,” said Holloway, a 5-foot-
l0 point guard from New Jersey.

Holloway, though, did show his stuff, enough so
that he was named Most Valuable Player of the
game, which puts his name with past MVPs like
Kevin Gamett, Shaquille O’Neal, Chris Webber and
Alonzo Mourning.

Holloway, who’s still unsigned, did a bit of every-
thing —— seven points, eight assists and six steals.

“He’s a great point guard,” said Evtimov, a 6-9
power forward from Long Island, N.Y. “He sees the
ﬂoor like he has six eyes.”

Evtimov is the only McDonald’s All—American
who is looking at Pitt. He has narrowed down his
choices to five schools, including North Carolina,
Villanova, Indiana State and UConn. Evtimov, who
averaged 26 points and 19 boards as a senior at
Long Island Lutheran, will make his official visit to
Pitt next weekend.

The McDonald’s Game, which is the most presti-
gious high school all—star game, displayed a wealth 
of athleticism and very little defense. All but six
players reached double-digit scoring, with the East’s

Stephen Jackson (committed to Arizona) and the

with the big hits when we needed them,”
Kramer said. V

Adair continued his mastery of the
Panthers by facing the minimum nine
batters over the last three innings and
raised his record to 2-0.

“Their pitcher was pretty good but
not great,” Kramer said. “It just wasn't
there for us.”

In the second game, the Panthers
bounced back and prevailed over St.
John’s 5-3. Panther first baseman Steve
Dickinson provided the power for Pitt in
the win by going 2-for-3 with two RBI
and two runs scored.

The Panthers jumped on Red Storm

starter Jeff Love early the and led 3-0
after one inning. Center fielder Jason
Conti led off the inning with his fourth
home run of the season. After a strike-
out, Sam Crowley doubled and John
Herlihy singled, but Crowley was
caught stealing third. With Herlihy on
second, Dickinson homered to give the
Panthers a 3-0 lead.

St. John’s got on the board in the
third when Keith Finnerty scored on a
sacrifice ﬂy to center by third baseman
Mike Johnson. Finnerty made it to third
via a leadoff walk, a single by
Fitzsimmons and a wild pitch by Carl
Vollmer. Rob Shaffer replaced Vollmer
and ended the inning by picking off

Fitzsimmons at second.

The Panthers added insurance runs in
the sixth and eighth innings to extend
the lead to 5-2. Finnerty homered with
two out, and no one on in the ninth for
St. John’s but Jason Rakaczewski got
Fitzsimmons to ground out too short to
end the game, earning his fifth save of
the year.

The Red Storm came back Sunday to
Trees Field and handed the Panthers an
8-5 loss. Mike Johnson killed the
Panthers by going 4-for-4 with one RBI
and scored four times.

Michael Hughes got the win for St.
John’s and raised his record to 2-1 on
the year. Hughes gave up two earned

runs on five hits but struck out seven in
his three innings of work.

Rakaczewski got the loss for Pitt
after giving up four runs, two earned, on
three hits. He also walked four and
fanned three.

VV1th the score tied 4-4 in the seventh,
the Red Storm plated two to take a 6-4
lead. John Herlihy homered to right cen-
ter in the bottom half of the seventh to
pull Pitt within one run, but St. John’s
added two more insurance runs in the
top of the ninth to seal the win and raise
its overall record to 9-6.~

“It’s just a matter if we're hungry to
win,” Kramer said. “And right now I
don’t see any hunger.”

From the opening tip, 13,400
fans knew they were in for a
treat when Holloway knifed in
for a steal and threw a quarter-
court alley-oop to Tim Thomas
for a two-handed mojo.

The game remained tight for
most of the first half. But the
East appeared to be pulling
away with about eight minutes
remaining after a Kobe Bryant
layup and back-to-back dunks
by Thomas and Evtimov. At that

But at the end of the half, the
West went on a quick 6-2 run,
sparked by 7-1 Loren Woods’
(Wake Forest) last second tip off
a missed free throw to tie the
game at 55.

garne’s only double-double with

off three straight points for the

East to open up the second

frame. After exchanging baskets
for the next five minutes, the
East shifted into slam dunk
overdrive to break open the
game.

With 13:46 left, the
McDonald’s 3-point champion,
Nate James (undecided), threw
down an uncontested slam.
Willie Dersch followed with a
pair of free throws, and then
James hit a three. Moments later,
James (15 points) soared
through the lane for a tip dunk.
Richard Hamilton (UConn) put
the finishing touches on a
blitzkrieg 11-0 run with yet
another dunk. After the smoke
cleared, the East had a 13-point
lead, 84-71, with 11:57 remain-
ing. .

“We were just running up and
down and dunking a lot so the
crowd could have a good time,”
said Jackson, a 6-7 forward from
the famed Oak Hill Academy.

Despite a bevy of acrobatic
dunks by Corey Benjamin (17
points and seven boards), the
West could never recover.
Benjamin finished in second
place at the slam dunk contest
last Thursday night behind
Louisiana's triple-jump champi-
on Lester Earl. Earl, a 6-9
charismatic forward, dominated
the slam dunk contest with a
combination of raw power and
uncanny athletic ability. Out of
six total points, Earl received
perfect 10s from every judge all
but twice.

he’ll be a star in the Big East,
along with Vonteego
Cummings.

But the key is Evtimov, and
with him our beloved Pitt
Panthers will become the
most intimidating team in the
Big East. A starting front line
of Blount, Evtimov and Varga
is completely scary to begin
with, but coming off the
bench will be Andre Howard,
Michael Gill (not to say these
guys can’t or won’t start) and
recruit Isaac Hawkins.

Hawkins, who committed
last year, has reportedly
bulked up to a Chris Gant-
like 245 pounds. Visions of
Larry Johnson are dancing in
my head.

And your heads should be
dancing, too. Evtimov shoots
with a silky-smooth touch,
scores with power and
finesse and rebounds with the
ferocity of Jerome Lane.
(Vassil averaged 19.4 boards
a game his senior year at
Long Island Lutheran High
SchooL)

This is a call for action.
Fans, you must demand that
this monster attend one of the
finest academic centers on
the face of the earth, the
University of Pittsburgh.

So far, you’ve done a good
job.

At the slam dunk/3-point
shootout Thursday night, the
Bulgarian badass received the
loudest ovation. That’s a
good start, but not enough.

He got big cheers at yester-
day’s game, but that’s not
enough. He got really big
cheers after he sent home a
left-handed jam, off an awe-
some feed, on the grill of
high-flyer Lester Earl, but
that’s not enough either.

We need to pull something
off proper; we need to seal
the deal. Let’s get Evtimov to
sign at Pitt when he visits
campus this weekend.

Here’s the deal: We’ll find
out where he’ll be, and then
let’s form as one great—big-
loving—peaceful unit and fol-
low the Bulgarian badass
wherever he may go.

The key is not to annoy the
big man, but to be extremely
friendly. Now I know that
will be tough for the large
portion of students from
Philadelphia, but give it a try
anyway — this is of utmost
importance.

He needs to be charmed.
Ladies need to flirt with him,
and guys need to offer him a
beer or a burger if they see
him. But most of all, greet
Evtimov with a big smile.
Say, “Hey Vassil, what’s up?
Man, if you play here next
year, I think we’ll have the
talent to win it all within the
next two years.”

The University of
Pittsburgh Panthers, the 1997
NCAA basketball champions.
Now that has a nice ring,
doesn’t it, Vassil?
