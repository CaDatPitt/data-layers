Lack of Communication?

 Profs express dissatisfaction with Writers’Conference

 

/

By Theresa Costello
Staff Writer

The University of Pittsburgh's
Tenth Annual Writers’ Confer-
ence may have been over four
weeks ago, but the controversy
sparked by it has yet to be settled.

According to members of Pitt's
English department, they were
disturbed by the writers’ confer-

. ence for three reasons: the lack of
women artists, the billing of Sam
Hazo as Pittsburgh's ”premier
poet" and that some of the
groups presented in the ”Pitts-
burgh Only’.’ segment did not
deserve to be there.

Judith Vollmer, an English
professor at Pitt's Creensburg
campus, said, ’’I could not be-
lieve there was no representation

of women. The across—the,-board
exclusion of women. was ap-
palling.” ‘ .
Edwin Ochester, director of the
writing program at Pitt, said, ’’It
was outrageous that there were
no women. When people from
outside [of Pitt] looked at the pro-'
gram, many wrote letters wonder-
ing why.” _
Though no woman, received
feature billing, Gutkind said there
were many women in the ”Pitts—
burgh Only” segment of the con-
ference and that there was no

intentional selection of men in-'

stead of women.

Ochester and Bruce Dobler, as-
sistant director of the writing pro-
gram, said they were startled to
see Sam Hazo billed _as ”Pitts—

’burgh’s premier poet.” .

”Some of the groups

were really terrible

there. They .were~seIf-

styled and pretentious

poets.
— Bruce Dobler

Dobler‘ said it was an-embar-

‘rassment to the English depart-

ment to have featured a local
artist at the conference, a practice
considered ”bu|lish” in literary
circles.

”Having Hazo there was unfor-
tunate,”. Dobler said. ”A lot_ of

ture regard him as a very minor
poet.’ ...” i .

Cutkind said that the complaint
about Hazo was ”a political dis-
pute between Hazo and Ochester
that |don’t want to be involved
in." .
However, Dobler saw no
problem in having Hazo in the
”Pittsburgh Only" segment,
which is another area of debate.

”The children [elementary
school students who read their
own poetry] were a plus, but
many other groups did not
deserve the space," said Dobler.
”Some of the groups were really
terrible there. They were self-
styled and pretentious’ poets.”

According to both Ochester
and Dobler, it was a shame that

the good groups that did appear

in the ”Pittsburgh Only” segment _i

had to be placed beside these
other groups. _ I
The two agreed that problems

arose when Lee Gutkind, direc-
tor of the Writers’ Conference,  .

neglected to consult the other
members of the English
department.

’’I was upset byithe fact that no
one in the English department
was consulted on the speakers or
formats,” said Ochester,.

Vollmer, Dobler and Ochester
learned who was appearing the
same way —— they read it in the

brochures that were distributed."

Dobler said, ”Had we [the En-

' - glish department] had‘ any input.

we would have never stood for
it.”

western, wherel feel I can be
effective,” said Weingartner.
’’It is a place that’s.doing well

better. It's a first-class place

better.”

Putting that small, practically
worthless dime (you can't make
a telephone call with it anymore,
can you?) into a parking meter
can add up to a lot more than
most people imagine.

Parking in Oakland is mainly
run by one of three different
groups, the University, private
-operators, and a joint operation
between the city of Pittsburgh
and the Public Parking Authority
of Pittsburgh. Of the three, the
city group makes the most ‘money
from students. .

”Oakland has the largest num-
ber of parking meters and is the
largest income in the entire city,”
according to Edward Dougherty,
finance director of the Parking
Authority.

Austrians, ”You can trust me.”

lected from meters in the city. Of

I that, $78,154 was collected from

the Oakland area, including
$25,306 from the parking lot in
front of Hillman Library. Accord-
ing to Dougherty, the city then
gets 48 percent of that total,
which is all profit.
The private corporation, Public
Parking Authority of Pittsburgh,
gets the other 52 percent. The
Parking Authority collects all the
money and does maintenance
work. Any costs come from their
52 percent.

During the last fiscal year,.

Dougherty reported that the Park-
ing Authority collected

$2,553,000, which translates to

$1,225,448.
The private operator is the next

big money maker in the parking’

business, although they make
considerably less than the city

In a speech broadcast on na-

”however much this situation

vinced that truth and justice will
win out. '

During the peak months from
September to November the lot
collects about $500 a day, five
days a week. The owner does not
get to keep all that money,
though. First he must pay the city
20 cents per dollar for parking
privileges. Then he must pay his
county property, state and city
school _ taxes.

Next he must pay his em-
ployees, any maintenenance
costs and then all insurance
premiums, the attendent said. His
profit quickly shrinks.

out. During the summer months

there is no profit at all, because
business gets so bad that the lot
must close down, according to
the attendent.

The university is the last oper-
ator but, unlike the others, the
University is not seeking to make
a profit, according to Sargeant Ar-
thur Dorman, parking administra-
tor in Oakland. ‘

”The parking in the University
is strictly a service,” said Dor-
man. ”lt is not a money—making
venture. If we break even, we're

Theservice, though, is not real-

place to park,” said Dorman. The
University provides. two lots, one
next to Trees Hall and the other
in Panther Hollow, for students at
$2 a day. These lots only hold a
total of 1,200 cars. But since not
all of the faculty and staff fit in the
other parking lots, they also use
the $2 lots.

Many students feel the parking .

situation on campus is bad, and
it will be getting worse, accord-
ing to Dorman. By September,
800 parking spaces will be lost
next to the dental school for con-

struction of a new medical’

these spaces can't be replaced._

 What is Reagan

0 o , 0 V
doing this time?
Austrian President Kurt Waldheim has been barred from en-
tering the United States. -

In something of a surprise decision, the Justice Departmen 1

has ruled that because there are some groups that have accused
Waldheim of war crimes, he has become ineligible for admit-
tance to the country. '

His name will be placed on the watchlist, a list of people
the government doesn't want in the country, and if he tries to
cross the borders, he will be turned back. ’

But it gets better. ‘ . _

President Reaganhas stated that the United States, over which

he imagines to preside, has no quarrel with the Austrian_peo-
ple andthat the restrictions on Waldheim in no way reflect a

negative attitude‘ concerning Austria.
"Who does Reagan think he might be fooling?
Marlin Fitzwater said the president has no plans to invite

,Waldheim to the United States at thistime —— which, a careful

observer might note, is a lucky thing. Were Reagan to_invite

 9 him, Waldheim would, at least according to the Justice Depart-
' = merit, have a hard time at the airport.

In the wake of these seeming mistakes of policy ‘decision,

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday April 29, 1987

So rock me on the water

”Out here on this backroad
just a few clouds in the sky, the
hills seem so much drier than be-
fore. This morning is for back-

. roads, walking here and thinking

how some things don't feel right

anymore,”
.— Tom Hunter
”A Gentle Song”

We woke up at about 9 a.m.
and set out for Cook Forest. It's
a state park outside of Clarion,
Pa.

I was sweating through my last
final just 24 hours before. I was
sitting in a cinderblock room with
no windows, the air I breathed
was stale and, since there were
no windows in the classroom, all
I could look at was a blue book
and a friend's back.

Because it is a state park,.| ex-
pected to find overweight cou-
ples in mumus and Hawaiian
shirts, who sat in their trailor’s
and whose idea of roughing it is
walking thier yapping poodle
through their trailor park. Thank
God I was wrong. —

To my pleasant suprise, my two
friends were the only other peo-
ple I saw when we were there.

As we drove up a dirt road to
the park, we came to a clearing
in the woods. A doe stood there
in the middle of it, and she
watched the car. We stopped,
turned off the engine and
watched her for a few moments.
No one said a word.

She slowly worked her way
back into the woods and out of

sight. She embodied the quiet;

grace of the forest -— a welcom-
ing committee of sorts.

The march in Washington over
the weekend wasa relaxed occa-
sion. The conflict and combative-
ness was gone. There wasthe
feeling that Reagan and his polit-
ics are ancient history, already
gone._and discredited, so there
was no need to fight orsound
alarmed. The music, the speak-
ers, the people, even in the rain,
seemed happy and confident.
There may still be U.S. mercenar-
ies in Latin America, and there
may still be Soviet puppets, but
the feeling overall. was that hu-
man rights and pacifist "Christiani-

ty_were going to prevail over the I

political opportunists. This may
be deceptive, however.

The time has come to put Rea-
gan out to pasture. Give him a
nice place to graze in northern
California, a safe place to enter
his second childhood. The
weekend of the march would
have been a good time to pass

- him the walking papers and put

George Bush into office.

The rally last weekend ‘took
place outside of the Capitol.
Some renovations were being
made on the exterior of the

' Capitol, giving the guards a perch

on the scaffold to overlook the
audience. But there were few
guards, and even fewer seemed
to be fondling their billy clubs.
Many of the marches, many. of
them much smaller, are so
proliferated with cops and blue

PAUI. ANATER

We finished theidrive up the
road and parked the car. From‘
there we hiked to the top of a
bluff. Giant slabs of sandstone jut-
ted from the side of the mountain.

I sat alone, my friends had
moved on to another part of the
rocks.

I-saw my surroundings for the
first time in too long. Months of
urban life had numbed my

‘ senses. Sitting on a rock, 500 feet

above the Clarion River, seeing
miles and miles of hills and trees

and no signs of humanity forced ‘

me to observe my surroundings.
There was a white Dogwood on
the hill across the valley — just
one. The wind brought up the
smells of pine and moist forest
floor. A crow glided past, the
changing aircurrents ruffled his
feathers.

That place has been there for a
millenium. The sun has set and
risen there since the dawn ‘of
time, and it's remained much un-
changed. Sittingthere made me
realize that problems I consider
to be earth-shattering are insig-

nificant when I think about how
long those rocks have been there.
Education, strained relationships,
money, time and the world real-
ly don't matter a whole lot when
you get down to it.

A lot of people can't handle
thinking that way. Everybody
wants to believe that he or she is
a vital cog in the machines of the
world. All of the evidence I need-
ed to come to that conclusion
was to look behind me. Those
beautiful rocks have been spoiled
forever by initials and names
carved rudely into their faces. Ah
well, from small minds come
weak attempts topreserve mortal-
ity. The saying"”Take nothing but
pictures, leave nothing but foot-
prints,” comes to mind here.

After a few hours, we left the

‘bluff and hiked down the side of

themountain.

My friends went swimming. I
don't find 40-degree water ap-
pealing, so I continued to hike.

I found a stream and sat in I

detoxify itself.'|f you just sit on the
bank of a stream and listen, sani-
ty is yours. ‘Water is cleansing,
but the sound it makes as it trips
over its _bed_ is even moreso.

It's so easy to get caught up in
the goings-on around here. Dead-
lines, classesand a winter in the

apart. _It’s so easy to lose sight of

They also welcome and celebrate

because America has chosen to

something we did not, do not and

properly. Direct American mili-

in Latin America are different
from the dynamics of change in

A nurse/addict

tells her story   

She is 34; she has been a
registered nurse for nine
years. She works at a large
hospital. She insists it is not
the hospital that made her
an addict; she feels she was
born that way.

”I was the child of an al-
coholic mother," she said.
’’I truly believe that there
are people who are born
with addictive personali-
ties, and that I'm one of
them. I had my first drink
when I was 15, and I drank
like I was an alcoholic that
first time. The first drink I
had was sherry, and I drank the whole bottle. I started.on pot
when I was 16.”

She studied to become a nurse and succeeded. One day in
the summer of 1983, she signed out some morphine for a pa_- , .;
tient. The patient said he didn't need it. '

   

”So I decided to take a needle and the morphine home with; if ~ A"

me,” she said. ”That night I injected the morphine into my butt.

world.” _ V
She knew right away what drugs she wanted — morphine,

Demerol and Dilaudid, each of them a very potent, addictive . .

pain killer. ”I shot some into a vein with a boyfriend I had at
the time; [he] was in medical school,” she said. ’’It felt very

conspiratorial, doing it with someone else. But we only did it.‘ A  I

together once; he just wasn't born to be an addict.”

Soon after, though, she began injecting herself alone — eve-< » I  

ry night. ”Once a day, at home, right after work,” she said. ’’In-
travenously. It was a reward for living.” ' ‘

How did she manage to get drugs out of the hospital? ”I lied, ,
I forged, I connived,” she said. ”You have to understand, nurses

have more access to drugs and needles than the average per- ‘ -' 

son does.”
What was the attraction? ”Nurses tend to be helpers,” she

people to makethem feel better. One day it occurs to you .that"i"-ff
the drugs and pills might make you feel better, too." ‘
She showed me the marks on her arms. They weren't what

you'd expect to see on a street junkie, but if you ran your fingers ' ' L

over them you could tell that the skin was different. ”Nurse ad-- f
dicts tend to look down on the stereotypical street junkies,”-
she said. ”First of all, the drugs that are available to us are bet-

ter than heroin — they're purer. We don't use dirty needles or f A, S  l

dirty drugs. Nurses know you can get sick doing that.”
Last year,.‘she got caught. ’’I_ had signed out some Demerol

and had written another nurs_e’s name on the form,” she said. 

”The other nurse saw her name written on the form, and she T

knew she hadn't signed out any Demerol. She went to her su- 3 l

pervisor, and it didn't take them long to’ find me. I

”When my particular hospital finds out a nurse is in trouble,_.,i  .
they offer to help her. In my case, they said, ‘You can go into , f _
. treatment, or you can be fired.’ I went into a detox program.- -

The withdrawal mainly consisted of real bad depression and v

agitation. Then I went into counseling. I still get counseling,‘  

and I go tovAA meetings just tokeep myself going.”

She said she never would have turned herself in for treatment.  ‘ ‘I

‘ How did the drugs feel, after all that time? ”Like Nirvana,."l"
she said. ’’It wasn't like being drunk; when I get drunk, I-get '
dizzy. These drugs made me not care about anything. They took .‘
away all the emotional pain, and any physical pain, I- mightﬁf

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday April 29,‘ 1987

Conference

Continued from page 1

Gutkind, however, said the
selection of writers was not en-
tirely his responsibility.

"The English department was
only one of the sponsors. Student
Activities was a much bigger
sponsor. The department was not

the sole sponsor and never was,”

said Gutkind.

Gutkind said he consulted the 2

students for the selection of the

‘writers. ”The students had a Great

deal of input into who was chos-
en. In fact, The Pitt News students
polled last year-' chose Bob
Greene.” 4 '
Additionally, Wilfred _ Trem-
blay, financial manager for the
conference and assistant director
of Student Activities for Media
and Publications, said the English
department was not consulted
because they don't contribute
financially to the conference. He
said the conference was funded
by Student Activities, the Bicen-
tennial Committee, the Publica-
tions Board and The Pitt News}

”The English department's in-
volvement has been mostly Lee
Gutkind’s involvement. if others
want to have input they should
contribute to the conference,”
said Tremblay.

In terms of the absence of
women, Tremblay said there was

‘enough funding for three keynote

speakers, Bob Greene, Joseph
Heller and Ismael Reed.

”The money for Bob Greene
came soley from the Publications
Board and The Pitt News. I feel
it'was an appropriate decision.
We wanted Heller for years, but
he had’ been ill. It was the first
year he could do it physically.
Reed isa nationally known black
writer. We've had keynote's'peak—
ers in the past who were women.
Every year prior’ to this that We

"been involved with the confer-

ence,there have been women
keynote speakers. This year we
didn't have as much money, so

‘We didn't have as many keynote
speakers,” said Tremblaly,

As for complaints on the”Pitts-

burgh “Only” segment, Gutkind
stated that these complaints were
”an insult to all of the writers in
the area.”

When Gutkind heard the com-
plaints he said that the was the
first time anyone has said any-
thing negative about the con-
ference. '

”l have received an [absolute-
ly] overwhelming, positive
response. No one has «ap-
proached me and asked why
someone was selected  why i
did not chose a woman instead,”
said Gutkind. _

Complaints, according to Dob-
ler and Ochester, were .not only
from Pitt professors. Letters were
sent from members of the English
department at West "Virginia
University and also from Car-
negie Mellon. _

Because of their disagreement,

' neither Vollmer nor Ochester ‘at-

tended the conference. A notice-

able lack of Greensburg students _

caused rumors of a boycott by the
Greensburg campus.

HARRISBURG (AP) ~— The
Senate Appropriations Com-
mittee has proposed legisla-
tion that would provide
additional money for Temple"
Universityand the University
of Pittsburgh.

One bill would boost fund-
ingfor Temple duringthe cur-
rent fiscal year by $7.9
million, increasing its ap-
propriation from $102 million
to about $1 10 million. Most of
the funding is needed for in-
struction in the medical
schooL

Pittsburgh would receive a
boost of $8.7 million, increas-
ing its_1.9.86-87 funding from
$93 million to about $102 mil-
lion. More than $5 million of
the funding is needed for in-
struction at the medical
school. The school’s dental
clinics would receive
$900,000, and $716,000
would be designated for oper-
ations at the Titusville campus.

Both bills would have to be
approved by a full vote of the
Senate and state House before
becoming law.

Household
bound  
together by
simpler post

VIKINGS

Pittsburgh Public Theater
through May 17

By Erica Helbling‘

A household of three men

 woven of all the common

threads that make a family —
loud iokes, arguments and

’ V tenderness — that's what

Stephen lvletcalfe’s play Vi/<-
ings brings to the audience.
All three men are carpenters
and live in the house Yens,
the grandfather, built years
ago. Yens Larsen reminishes
about the days when good
craftsmanship was still ap
preciated. -
The pride he gleans from
the work he~used to do sus-
tains himagainst the ravages
«of old age and illness. He al-
' lude_s to the folklore of his
Danish heritage often to spin

a protective web around life’s_

inevitable blows.

Peter Larsen, widowed like
his father, finds”solace neither
in his ethnic background nor
in his_work. Disillusionment
with his waning contracting
business enhancesthe grief
over his wife's death.

* His general unhappiness
manifests itself in concern over
his_father’s health and pres-
sure on son Gunnar to leave
carpentry for college.

' But unlike Peter, Gunnar rel-
ishes the power of hammer
[and nail. He, like Yens, de-
i;1i_ves satisfaction from his
work. As his grandfather, he
éjdnsiders the Vikings his an-
gcjestors and bolsters his identi-
ty on stories of their prowess.-
 Most of the arguments’ in
the Larsen household stem
from Peter’sydrinking. Before

' his death, Yens wants to see

The Larsen’s is distinctly a
house of men. Crudities
tossed about freely among
the three creeps into Peter's

» awkward interaction with Bet-

sy Simmons, his father's nurse.
He's forgotten how to talk to
a woman. His attempt to ask
her for a date is one of the
most humorous moments to
the play. .

THE Pl1T NEws, Wednesday April 29, 1987

Another psychedelic
snack to feed our heads

2400 FULTON STREET
Jefferson Airplane
RCA Records

By Dave Zofris

This double—album is a chrono-

logical lookat the musical trans- ‘

lator of the '60s drug culture,
Jefferson Airplane. The Airplane
was unique in the way it was
able to mix social conscience
and hip culture into catchy tunes
that could be played on every
Top—40, a.m. radio station at the
time. / i

The album is conveniently split
into four catagories of the Air-
plane's career: Beginnings,
Psychedelia, Revolution and Air-
plane Parts.

On side A, Beginnings, the
highlight, of course, is the clas-
sic "Somebody To Love,"
Grace Slick's contribution in ear-
ly i967 to the already‘ mildly
successful Airplane led by Marty
Balin. Slick's clearly pronounced
vocals contrasted with Balin'~s

"Byrds-like singing and was

backed up by Jorma Kaukonen's
whiney guitar, in the Airplane's
most successful single.

Unfortunately, Slick's popular-
ity apparently offended founder
Balin, which led to a clashing of
egos. Their rivalry was brought
onto vinyl when they both vied
for "lead vocal” liner notes on
a number of songs. The two har-
monize quite _ well together in
"Won't«You Try Saturday After-
noon," but work against one
another in other songs — espe-
cially live. .

'ln_"Volunteers," recorded be-
fore the not—altogeth'er-there

masses at Woodstock, Balin.

and Slick put their lungs through
an endurance test. As they tried
to out-sing each other the result

sounded kind of sickly, like a ,

pale fore-bearer of X.

But the song that stands out on
this album is the Airplane's trib-
ute to to drug—induced psyche-
delia, "White Rabbit." Set to
Ravel's Bolero, the song slowly
builds to a orgasmic and climac-
tic finale with"Slick singing_out

what would come to be the‘Air- .

plane's anthem, feed your
heeeeaaaao’.

l hate to name the band's two
most commercially successful
songs as their best artistically,

but back in the summer of T967,
to be commercially successful
didn't necessarily forfeit all artis-
tic value.

. On side C, Revolution, the Air-
plane swung with the times and
became a voice of protest. Un-
fortunately, they came off
sounding a lot like Fozzy Bear
and The lvluppets. It seemed the
band felt a responsibility to the
pill—popping public it served,'as
they reeled out angry,~socially—
conscious songs.

, While the cause might have
been noble, their music got kind
of boring. '

There are more guitar riffs on

.side C and more of the wailing

Slick/Balin duet. But they lack the
selective intensity of Slick's
climactic "White Rabbit," a
song that proves you don't
necessarily have to play as loud
as possible to-make -an impact.

"Rejoice" is Slick's tribute to
her influences in literature, using
quotes from James Joyce's
i922 novel U/ysses. It's really
jazzy and different from cus-
tomary Airplane stuff, and it
seems that Slick would've made
a great jazz singer. Again, an

'_anti—war message is prevalent

throughout.

Side D, Airplane Parts, con-
tains recordings after the band
began to fall apart. This side
features a jam by Carlos San‘-
tan'a, "Triad," written by David
Crosby. The song is supposed to
be about a menage a. trois that
got him in trouble when he was
with the Byrds. This side would

make an intriguing compilation
EP without the other three sides
tagging along.

But I suppose Jefferson Air- , '

plane are as deserving of’ a

money-making compiled discog-  ' —

raphy as the next discentrigated

band. But their most powerful‘

songs are still the ones you can

hear on '60s radio‘ shows each‘

weekend.

UNDECIDED ABOUT A MAJOR?

A  THE Pirrfmsws, 'weanesd¢y April 29',‘ T1987‘

Three’s not good company in Reachingso

Reachings
Stephen Foster Memorial

By Parvaney A. Torkamani.

Reach/'ngs is a sTory of a musical genius, Lee M,
and The conflicts! Thai arise between Two women
who love him — his sister Jean and his lover Cheryl.
Jean says That she knows Lee best and understands
him for who he is. She also claims ThaT Cheryl has
no conception of what The real Lee is like.

This conflict is acted ouT on Two levels. On The sur-
face, we see The conflict of people misunderstanding
each other and Trying To work Through Their dis-
agreements. Cheryl and Jean use harsh language
Toward one another, while Lee and Cheryl speak
The language of love. - . ‘

The other side of The play reveals itself in a beau-
Tiful scene, where Lee is inspired To create music by
The presence of his lover. As he is blowing into The

sax, we have The opportunity To journey into The ar-
TisT’s soul and see The beautiful Cheryl dancing in
her blue dress around him, Touching him Through
music. This iourney is symbolic of any arTisT’s soul,
wheTher The arTisT is a painTer, musician, playwright
or poet. .

AT ThaT point The play Takes a different Turn. One
can sympathize with Jean and Cheryl for not under-
sTanding The arTisT. For his soul is ouT of reach, a soul

_ inspired only by The beauTy which he finds in

Cheryl. Cheryl's confusion_ seems more honest Than
The sisTer's protective understanding of her brother.
AT The end of The play, it was discussedand inTer—
preTed by The people in The audience. Reachings, in
my opinion, was misunderstood by many in The au-
dience. lT would be appropriate To say ThaT The
character of Lee M. was misunderstood as well. His
genius was inTerpreTed as escape from memories of
The Vietnam War and escape from a socieTy which
misTreaTs him. To some non-arTisTs who see Reach-
ings, Lee's adventure in The world of inspiration is

only a dozing off. The fact That he lives in a cheap -
room and does not make use of The money made
under a pseudonym is The plain proof ThaT Leeis
refusing To look aT life squarely.

Albert Camus said The True arTisT is one who baT—
Tles life and never Turns his back To realities. BerTolT
Brecht prays To God never To Take away his power
To see Through The crusT ThaT life puTs around reality.

A True arTisT uses his an in order To reach These TruThs
and express Them in arT. The fact ThaT Lee suffers A
from memories of Vietnam and has made an album

To remind himself of The beasf he had once become
clearly displays This fact.

The same Cheryl who hurts Lee by wanting him
for his money saves him from bitterness. Lee's need
for Cheryl seems To stem from The facT_ ThaT her
beauty noT only saves him from her own misTreaT-
menT, iT also heals his soul when TT is iniured aT The
conTacT with The harsh realiTies of everyday life.
Cheryl is his inspiration To create.

who claimed he didn't play as
well last year as he did in his
junior year.

Woods, who will play right

was in on 109 tackles for 5-5-1

Pitt in 1986, including a team-
leading 21 tackles for losses.
He had 13 sacks. , ,

Despite frequently being I

'’I guess everybody thought
that after my junior year my
statistics were going to go
through the roof, but I think I
had a great senior season,”
Woods said in a telephone in-
terview from his agent's office
in Phoenix,‘Ariz. ‘ .

nervous when it came time for
Seattle to choose. Cincinnati,_
with the 17th. pick, had just,
taken defensive end ' Jason
Buck of Brigham Young. ‘

said. "I'm really looking for-

fans are just great, they really
get behind the team."
Woods, timed in 4.6. sec-
onds in the‘40-yard dash, was

‘ rated as the second-best avail-

able defensive end by the Na-

tional scouting combine. The
BLESTO service ranked him,
fourth at outside linebacker.

"They all have their own ’
way of rating players, but I
think sometimes they overlook,
how well somebody can
play,” Woods said. ''I definite-

coming out of high school was
to be an impact player in col-
lege and to be a No. 1 draft
choice in the pros. I set my

ized them.” i '

But the news did not come
as fast or as good for Dixon. It
was not until the middle of the
fourth round that he heard his
name called to play for the In-

Dixon said his first reaction
was, "Why? I don't ‘know

different. The players still had to
work hard to be a member of the

of his own experiments. I

Baseball team hitting well but can't win

Pitt baseball coach Bobby
Lewis was concerned batting
practice would end too soon

baseballs.

”With the wind blowing out

we're hitting the ball well, but we

some fireworks — ones that could

career, a new Pitt record. Now
that the pressure’s off, Lohman
said he will stop swinging for the

’’I’m glad the record is out of

a lot of added pressure, and now

tear. Lamanti has seven home
runs so far this season. to Loh-
man’s four, totalling 14 for- his

In the second game Saturday,
Pitt's batters got down to busi-
ness, piling up 17 hits, led by
homeruns from first baseman

_ Dave Westwood and catcher Jeff
Hackett.

But the real star of the game
was infielder T.J. O’Leary.
O’Leary was five-for-five with two
doubles, three runs and three
RBIs. A

-Pitt a 15-14 lead going into the

Georgetown scoreless to get the

Lewis. Shuster gave_up four runs

Georgetown centerfielder Scott
Elliot scored to tie the game and
send it into extra innings.

”l felt pretty good-after eight in-

It may be jumping the gun to
admit, but this just may be the
year that Charles Gladman real-
ly comes out.

During this year's spring prac-
tice workouts, Gladman seemed
more than impressive, culminat-
ing in his being awarded the John
Michelosen award as _the most
valuable offensive back during
the spring. And in this past Satur-
day's Blue—Gold game, he rushed
142 yards in 12 carries.

Already the fourth leading rush-
er in Pitt's history, the best part
about it isthat he still has one
more season to play, and his
coaches, his fans and he himself
hope to see better—than—ever play
during this upcoming season.

”Just being out there was good

  GETTING

enough for me, and I'll tell you
that it really felt good,” said Glad-
man. ”l’ve always just tried to do
my best whenever I'm out there
playing forthe team, and I hope
that it has been noticed by the
people for which it really counts,
meaning the coaches.”

At least one of these coaches
has noticed.

”Char|es had a good spring, a
very good spring in fact, and that
is definitely in his favor,” said
Panther head coach Mike Gott-
fried. ”He really worked hard this

"year, and [l] always say that hard

work will pay off. With the way
he's been playing, I'll say that
he's on course to have a very

of this, but I know -that isn't the

”When the ball is in his hands,

‘a lot of things can happen.”

Gladman, a 5-11, 205—pound
senior from Akron, Ohio, has

' proven time and time again that

the above statement is true. Dur-
ing the 1985 season, he was the

ever I can and do whatever I can

By Teresa Varley
For The Pitt News

When the first pitch was,

thrown to open the 1987 Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh baseball season,
one question still remained unan-
swered regarding the starting
lineup. Everybody knew who
was on first, but they were unsure
of who would be on second.

With the second base position
up in the air, three players had to
vie for the starting job —— T.J.
O’Leary, AI Popa and Rich
Schaich.

All three players started for the
Panthers in games at the Central
F|orida’Spring Classic, but it was
O’Leary who held onto the job.

This junior from Seton LaSaIle'

High School in Pittsburgh knew
it would not be easy to win the
starting second base position’. The
competition was tough, but he
survived. I

O’Leary came back from the.

Florida trip in a slump, but once
he was reassured that he was the

starter, he quickly snapped out of
it.

In the Panther’s series against
Seton Hall and Villanova,
O’Leary was 12 for 21, with five
runs batted in-, two doubles and
one home run for a Big East bat-
ting average of .571, which ranks
him third in the conference.
Overall he is hitting .386, which
is good for third on the team.

”T.J. is just starting to reach his
potential,” said Pitt baseball‘
coach Bobby Lewis. ”He puts too
much pressure on himself
though. But I think now that he

is hitting the ball, the pressure I

will decrease. He has the confi-
dence now that he needs.”

The Panthers are currently 6-9
on the season but, like many of
his teammates, O’Leary has rea-
son to be optimistic.

”While the record might not
look that good on paper,” said
O’Leary, ”people should realize
that four of the losses we gave up

to a team ,[Seaton Hall] that is

ranked in the Top 20 in the coun-

try. The only way we can lose is
if we beat ourselves.”

The Panthers are into the meat
of their season now, playing con-
ference games and trying to earn
that spot in the Big East Champi-
onships. .O’Leary is hoping that
he will continue to swing a hot
bat to help the Panthers attain
that goal.

”Where I am positioned in tli€D\->4

lineup, the number eight hitter,
I see a tot of fast balls,” said,’
O’Leary. ”It is a Io.t easier to hit
fast balls. The pitcher is usually
concerned with the hitters above
me. " Fortunately, I don't think
there is a weak spot in our
Hneuo/’

Like many_athletes, he does
have aplayer that he looks up to.

’’I really" like Tim, Foli, who

used to play for the Pirates,” said"? .

O’Leary. ”Foli has no outstand-
ing talents, but he gets the job

i done. That is what I want to do,

get the job done.”

So far O’Leary has done just .

that.
