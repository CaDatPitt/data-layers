Procedure puts new spin on liposuction

Kelly Ruane
For The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center is renowned for
research in heart and liver trans-
plants. But the hospital is also
advancing a procedure to transfer
fat from one part of a person’s body
to another.

Doctors at the hospital are
working on a method to improve
liposuction. The procedure, called
fat transfer surgery, can be used as
an elective cosmetic procedure or to
correctmedical defects.

“I think this will prove to be a
real value to the patients,” said Dr.
Dennis Hurwitz, director of
UPMC’s Aesthetic Plastic Surgery
Center.

For children born with birth
defects, such as those who do not
develop enough cheek structure,
doctors can graft fat into the face to

’ restructure it. Fat transfer surgery is

also used on some accident victims.

The primary use of the proce-
dure, though, has been to alleviate
changes in the face caused by
aging. The surgery can plump wrin-

kled skin that has sagged and
caused the face to lose fullness.

During the procedure, surgeons
use syringes to extract fat from
areas such as the abdomen and
thighs. The fat is transferred to a
centrifuge that spins it at high
speed, producing a pure quantity of
fat that can be used as a graft.

“For many years, surgeons have

wanted to move fat as a graft but
were unsuccessful until recently,”
Hurwitz said. " M

There is a low incidence of
complications with fat transfer
surgery. The syringes are inserted
into a small incision, so the wounds
heal quickly and do not scar.

“On a rare occasion there can be
a poor intake of the fat, causing
unevenness or lumpiness, which
can be easily corrected with touch-
up work,” Hurwitz said.

In the past, face lifts were the
common way to achieve a desired
look. Fat transfer has the advantage
of giving a more natural appear-
ance. Now the goal for surgeons is
to find out_how to best combine the
two procedures. ‘

Fat transfer surgery is not wide-

ly practiced in the United States,
due to a lack of surgeons skilled in
the technique.

Hurwitz has successfully per-
formed fat transfer surgery on more
than 100 patients during the last 18

The card is intended to promote
responsible celebration.

Birthday card from Pitt

promotes safe drinking

Joe Gordon

 

For The Pitt News

Pitt is sending a birthday card to
every student who turns 21. 1 ,
Along with the University’s offi-

cial birthday best wishes, the cards _

have a message urging students who
decide to celebrate the official age of
adulthood by drinking to do so safely.

A message in one of the cards
reads, “You don’t need to drink, but if
you do, Please be safe and be smart
— we care about you!”

The University does not see
drinking as a rite of passage, accord-
ing to Susan Harkins, director of
College Connections.

“However, for those students
turning 21 and that choose to drink,
we say to drink smart,” she "said.
“Students across the nation get into a

lot of trouble during 21st birthday
celebrations.

“Not being used to drinking that
much alcohol, students oftentimes
end up very ill, with serious health
problems, or even death can occur.”

Dennis McManus, assistant vice
chancellor for Governmental
Relations, had the idea for the card.
Then the University’s Alcohol
Advisory Committee implemented
the 21st birthday card program. The
cards arrive in bright yellow
envelopes that say “Happy birthday
from Pitt.”

Richard W. Riley, U. S. Secretary
of Education, joined a task force
comprised of more than 20 higher
education associations to introduce a
“Safety Six-Pack” program, outlining
actions and advice to combat alcohol
abuse for college students and school

officials. .

Tim McDonough, a member of
the Inter—Association Task Force on
Alcohol and Other Substance Abuse
Issues, said, “The effort aims to

Pittsburgh
EcoForum
brings
prominent
scientists to  
city for

lecture series

Joseph Kielec

For The Pitt News

The Pittsburgh EcoForum, a
recently formed consortium that
includes Pitt and several other sur-
rounding institutions that focus on the
study of ecology, continues its inau-
gural Eminent Biologist Lecture
Series tonight.

Stephen J. Hubbell, of Princeton
University, will speak about tropical
rain forest ecology. Hubbell’s talk is
the second in a string of topics by
some of the foremost scientists in the
field of ecology and evolution.

The EcoForum is headed by Dr.
Susan Kalisz, of the department of
biological sciences, who said she
expects the lecture series to be only
the first of many joint ventures
between the institutions. i

Ultimately, the goal of the
EcoForum is to help establish the city
of Pittsburgh and Pitt itself as a
national center for the study of the
interrelationships of organisms and
their natural environment.

The organizations involved in the
EcoForum include Pitt’s department
of biological sciences, the
Pymatuning Laboratory of Ecology,
the Carnegie Museum of Natural
History, . the National Aviary of
Pittsburgh, Phipps Conservatory and
Botanical Gardens, the Garden Club
of Allegheny County, the Pittsburgh
Zoo and the Western Pennsylvania

- Conservancy.

Kalisz said the impetus to start an
organization such as the EcoForum
started four years ago, when she first
came to the University. She was
amazed by the wealth of institutions
devoted to the natural sciences in and
around the city, but described the area
as having “many different venues
with little interaction.”

This dearth of interaction between
the institutions led to the development
of the EcoForum, which will serve to
bring the organizations together to
better utilize their resources for
research.

school
applications
down
nationally

Alysson R. Ford

Harvard Crimson

CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (U-
WIRE) — The number of applica-
tions to U.S. medical schools has
fallen for the second year in a row,
the Association of American
Medical Colleges announced last
week.

Nationwide, the number of
applications to medical schools fell
to 41,003 this year from 43,020 in
1997 — a decline of almost 5 per-
cent. Last year, the AAMC reported
a drop of roughly 8 percent from
the record high of 46,968 set in
1996, an AAMC press release said.

The AAMC has not yet released
the figures from this year for indi-
vidual schools.

Officials with the AAMC said
they are uncertain about the cause
of the recent downturn, which fol-
lows" eight consecutive years of
increasing medical school appli-

.cants.

“We have no clue really —— no
scientific assessment as to why the
drop is happening,” "said John E.
Parker, manager of media relations
for the AAMC.

Parker suggested the last two
years might be part of a natural
cycle following the record number
of applicants just a few years ago.

“There is always the natural ebb
and ﬂow of people interested in
pursuing careers in medicine, and
since we had been on such a high
for several years, it was probably
only a matter of time until there
would be" some kind of dip,” he
said.

Other factors

cited in the

AAMC press release include the
perceived impact, of managed care
and the loss of physician autonomy,
as well as the continued impact of
affirmative action rollbacks.

THE P111 NEws

LIPO

working with a new liposuction
technique, a procedure made readi-
ly available during the early 1980s
that is generally an elective cosmet-
ic surgery to improve a person’s
body contour.

Over 200,000 people per year in

FROM PAGE 1

the United States have liposuction. '

“It is the most popular cosmetic
procedure done today,” Hurwitz
said.

The new method, called
Ultrasonic Assisted Liposuction,
involves a probe that is inserted
through a small incision. The probe
is. connected to a handle that
vibrates at such a high frequency
that fat dissolves when the probe
touches it. The fat is then drained
using a low—pressure suction.

Traditional liposuction is per-
formed by inserting a cannula — a
pipe with holes in both ends used to
drain ﬂuids from body cavities —
through an incision. Surgeons probe
the problem areas. with the cannula,
using a high-pressure suction to
pull out fat in small amounts.

The new procedure has noted
benefits, ‘such as reduced blood
loss. It also removes more fat with
greater safety and speed, without
traumatizing ‘blood vessels and
other body structures. The new pro-
cedure allows for greater access to
areas such as the back, hips, chest
and abdomen that were difficult to
reach with traditional liposuction.

“As with the majority of surgi-
cal procedures, UAL can have sig-
nificant hazards if not performed
with the greatest ofcare,” Hurwitz
said. ' V

The Ultrasound Assisted
Liposuction Task Force has been
studying the new procedure since
1995, with the goal of establishing
safe guidelines for the procedure.
The group is made up of representa-
tives of three leading plastic
surgery organizations: the
American Society of Aesthetic
Surgery, the Lipoplastic Society,
and the American -Society of Plastic
and Reconstructive Surgeons.

The task force also provides

input to the Food: and Drug
Ad-ministration, which must
approve all new surgical proce-
dures.

8‘ Education of the new liposuc-
tion procedure ‘is one of the most
important roles the task force plays,

said Hurwitz, who is a member. He

has been teaching classes for the

task force since February of 1997. 

Hurwitz discussed his experi-
ence with the new liposuction pro-
cedure and with fat transfer surgery
at two seminars held in Newport,

fR.I., in October.

He Said

change what people thought was the
traditional culture, where alcohol use
and abuse abounds. There is not a
single campus in the United States
where this issue is not _a concern.”

Harkins said students are suscep-
tible to messages that tell them drink-
ing is a normal college activity.

“Moderate consumption of alco-
holic beverages is rarely mentioned
as one of those things parents tell
their children to do or not to do,” she
said. ’

Dr. Stephen Sivulich, chairman
of the residential living subcommit-
tee, said students who drink frequent-
ly have a higher incidence‘ of prob-
lems, ranging from arguments with

FROM PAGE 1

peers to missed classes.

In addition to telling students to
drink smart, the University is show-
ing students that it cares about their
well—being, Harkins said.

Offering students an incentive
not to drink or to drink safely is also
a possibility.

“As a reward for drinking smart,
the committee is contemplating
putting in some certificates for stu-
dents to participate in non—alcoholic
activities, such as movie passes,”
said Harkins.

-Harkins also said the committee
is working to implement other pro-
grams to educate students about the
dangers of alcohol.

Suspension of 5-year-old
dressed as firefighter ridiculous

FiVe—year—old Jordan Locke,
dressed in his ﬁreﬁghter costume for
Halloween, was suspended from
Curtisville Elementary for one day
because he violated Deer Lakes
School District’s weapons policy.

The controversy lies in the 5-
inch-long plastic ax that accompanied
the ﬁreﬁghter costume. Jordan’s sus-
pension is especially ridiculous, con-
sideririg he was portraying a heroic
ﬁgure for Halloween, not a psychotic
one.

If Jordan had come to school
with a plasticmeat cleaver, dressed
up as Geoﬁrey Dahmer, with sheep
intestines in his" lunchbox, it might be
a different story. But by dressing up
as a ﬁreﬁghter, a person who saves
lives, he hardly deserves to be pun-
ished.

Curtisville Elementary principal
Janet Ciramella said the Deer Lakes
School District does not “want to
encourage children to play with
weapons, and [does not] want to"
encourage a tolerance for violence.”
Irnitating a ﬁreﬁghter and bringing a
5-inch-long plastic ax is hardly
encouraging violence.

The Deer Lakes School District
is the only party linking the ax to mur-
der. According to ’Jordan’s mother,

' , Annette Locke, she didn’t know how

to tell Jordan he’d miss school on

Monday, since he loves it so much.
By suspending Jordan for one day,
the school is giving him a negative
View of ﬁreﬁghters and axes.

The ax, as used by theﬁreﬁghter,
is a tool of salvation, not ,a tool of
death. The motive behind Jordan’s
bringing an ax to school is totally dif-
ferent from the motive behind some-
one who would have brought a gun.
If Jordan had dressed up as a carpen-
ter, would the school have suspended
him for bringing a plastic hammer
and screwdriver? The school is teach-
ing him — at the impressionable age
of ﬁve — that an ax automatically
equals violence.

Mrs. Locke was not aware Deer

Lakes School District had sent a letter ‘

to all parents stating that children
were not allowed to bring anything
resembling a weapon. The letter did
not explicitly state that an ax was con-
sidered to be a weapon, but even if it
did, bringing plastic replicas of
weapons to school is hardly encour-
aging violence.

Such policies are in place
because of actual violence on school
property — such as the Peduca, Ky.,
and Edinboro, Pa., school shootings.

However, enforcing such a strict
policy on violence on a kindergarten
child, in a situation in which he didn’t
know any better, is utterly ridiculous.

Why not park under the falls, eh?

Apparently, they can turn oif Niagara Falls.

That’s right I was there last weekend,.and I
didn’t get a chance to see the water fall oif the
cliff. The merchants along the Canadian side of
Niagara Falls don’t seem to think that the water-
fall generates enough money, so they’ ve decided
to keep it on for only six days of the week

When they turn it otf, the half a million
tourists get a chance to see a 15,000-square-foot
advertisement by an undisclosed advertiser.
Fimds generated through the sale of space will
go to the building of a 200—acre water theme park
at ﬂie bottom of the waterfall.

To humor us during the closing, the
Canadian Mounted Police provided their armual
pledges to throw buckets of water over the clilf.

— Sometimes they hit the fellows painting the

advertisement, causing a rock-throwing ruckus.

After I made up this preposterous news, my
roommate said that he would be more than eager
to participate. “Hot damn, you know how much
fim it would be to heave a 10-ton industrial
HVAC unit on the falls?” he said

Personally, I would be happy to
heave off a 1986 lime green
Chevrolet Celebrity, much like the
one my parents own.

Also, to further increase its cash
ﬂow (haha), the Niagara Falls
Exploitation Committee has decided to build a.
1,20Gcar parking garage behind the waterfall.
This way, instead of driving around for two
hours looking for a space nextto the falls, you
can wander around on 15 levels for six hours try-
ing to ﬁnd your car. The committee wants to take
the fumes ﬁorn the cars and pump them to the
surface of the Niagara River, just before it leaps
over the clilf. They’ll add waste oil (collected
fiom‘U.S. gas stations) to create a toxic ﬁlm on
top of the water. Then the ﬁlm will be set ablaze,
and a 200-foot wall of hell will create a swirling
inferno at the base destined to scorch several
hundred tourists. _

According to the press release, U.S. citizens

Instead of spending himdreds of thousands to
maintain nmnerous lights to increase the appeal

of nuclear waste under the falls, as well. This
way, the radiation will create a lovely greenish
glow.

  

The customs oﬂicials at the border have also
decided to increase their revenue. Instead of ask-
ing, “Do you have anything to declare?” (which
they didn’t ask us), they’ll also be taxing you on
the value of your car. Thus, the most eﬂicient
way to cross the border would be by burro, so
maybe next Halloween you can dress up as Juan
Valdez and ﬁnd that ﬁiend who looks like an ass.

I was expecting more out of the border
patrol, but instead of the two—question—Tuesday,
approach they asked us, “Are you all U.S. citi-
zens?” and “Purpose of your visit?” Maybe with
more money, the patrol will have more fun with
inspections. Perhaps a large wheel with ﬁve pos-
sible choices: admittance into Canada, denial,
aﬁixing “gunga” before your name, inspection
or a savage beating employing ice skates.

For those crazy kids into the extreme sports,
the NFEC has devised the big bouncing bungee
barrel. Basically, you’re glued into a huge barrel
that is tied to a bungee cord. This cord is attached
to abeamthatspans thefalls. This way, youcan
experience the thrill of going over the falls with-
out the inconvenience of death. .

Since it has nothing else to do

money, the NFEC has also decided

COLUMNIST to create apersonal worthindex. This

is for the young individual who

desires to gamble but doesn’t have the money to ‘

do it. The PWI is determined by your resume,
and you are given a monetary value based on the

amount of work that the casino thinks you are ‘

capable of doing. ‘

So if you’re a sportswriter for a small-time
newspaper east of Pittsburgh, losing will mean
that you write an essay on the evils of gambling.
Then you’ll spend quality time hanging out with
all the “gungas” made possible by the border
patrol. And if you’re a car thief, you simply steal
a car and drive it off the falls to entertain the
masses.

Well, whatever happens, I do hope that next
time I can see the water falling oil‘ of the cliﬂ°.

”l'H|~: Prrr Nravvs: OPINIONS

Full TV: mediocre as ever -

Roger

Lee
As the leaves change color and begin to
fall, and a brisk autumn breeze ﬁlls the air,
that season is upon us once again.
No, not the basketball season; the NBA

is still in a lockout. Another television season

has begun. Most people barely even notice
the start of the new television season any-
more, and there’s little wonder why. The
major networks have been ﬁlled with an
abundance of dull, conservative shows for
years now.

How many of the new shows prernier— -

ing this fall will shine is hard to say. Relative
newcomers Fox, UPN and the WB are up-
and—coming competitors in the Nielsen rat-
ings because of a variety of innovative and
fresh shows, while the big three (NBC, ABC
and CBS) continue to put us to sleep. The
choices we have as viewers have expanded
dramatically, with the new networks provid-
ing a revival in an otherwise dull television
season.

The big three networks have lost their
edge. Almost every fresh new show has
been on one of the smaller networks. Sure,
‘shows such as “ER,” “NYPD Blue,”

A “Frasier” and a few others top the ratings and

are unquestionably the best shows on televi-
sion, but most of the shows on the big three
are «simply mediocre. ' Just look at
“Veronica’s Closet” (NBC). Even though

it’s one of the highest—rated shows on net-
work television, how many of us get excited

to watch it and discuss it with our friends and j

coworkers as we do with “South Park’?
Fox has been around the longest of the
three newcomers and has had a strategic
plan to win viewers. The network must have
noticed the void of shows about young
adults and minorities because it developed a
host of programming directed at these two
groups. Fox’s mainstays, such as “Melrose
Place,” “Party of Five” and “The
Simpsons,” are all targeted at viewers
younger than 30. Fox also targeted minori-
ties with shows such as “New York
Undercover,”
“Getting Personal”

and “Malcolm & Eddie.”

The general lack of creativity in net-
work television is a direct result of ﬂre way
TV producers and executives pick ideas.

~ Like movie executives, they are unwilling to

try anything new. At the very least, they want
a well—known and successful group of writ-
ers, directors and/or actors involved. Most of
the creative positions are ﬁlled by the same
small, closed group of people. If an execu-
tive makes mistakes with unknown talent, he
will lose credibility and
probably his job. In this
industry, millions of dol-
lars are at stake. Of
course, there are differ-
ent ways for unknown

I UPN and the WB have followed Fox’s

targeting youth and minorities. The WB’s
lineup includes “Dawson’s _ Cree ,”
“Felicity,” “Buffy the Vampire Slayer,” “The
Jamie Eoxx Show” and “The Wayans

as “Clueless,” “Guys Like Us,” “lVIoesha”

only make it to the
airwaves because
someone with power developed them. For
example, one of the new shows on NBC this
fall is “Trinity,” produced by the same man
who produces “ER.” Robert Bianoco of
USA” Today sums up what’s wrong with the
show in saying that “Most emblematic of all,
this hour-long family soap is on the air only
because NBC, a network that has mortgaged
its soul to production deals, owed an on—air
slot to the show’s producer, ‘ER’ ‘s John

Wells can do, or NBC could ﬁn ”

Most, but not all, of the creative new
programs are on the “small three.” For
example, “Legacy” (UPN) is a family drama
set in post—Civil War Kentucky and “That
‘70s Show” (Fox) portrays the lives of a
group of teenagers during (obviously) the
1970s But the big _three also _have some
exciting new programming. “Martial Law”
(CBS) stars Hong Kong martial artist
Sammo Hung as a cop who joins the Los
Angeles Police Department, and “The
Hughleys” (ABC), is about a successful

black businessman who moves to an upscale '

suburb. But ‘Two of a Kind” (ABC), a sit-
com starring the Olsen twins in an imitation
“Full House” (as if the original wasn’t
enough for us) is typical of the big three’s
offerings. -

Of course, it is easy to say that television
executives should take more chances; it isn’t
my money or reputation behind those
chances. And there’s a reason it’s called
show business — it is a business above all
else, and it ultimately comes down to
money. ’

But until television executives take cre-
ative chances, we will continue to watch
generic sitcoms with all—white thirty—so'me-
thing casts (and the odd token African-
American).

The downfall of American

Andrea Woessner

columnist
So I went to a punk show a few weeks

ago. Anti—_F1ag. Reagan Squad, 53rd State

and I-Farm played at Club Laga (too bad

you missed it ‘cause it was good). And as I,

stood there in the back (I really wasn’t in the
mood for getting crushed in the pit. No
thanks, maybe next time. I think I’ll just

i stand back here unmolested and enjoy the

show. You sweaty boys have your ftm up
there killing each other), looking at the backs
of the heads of punks of every shape and
size, I had a thought. It’s the land of thought
that comes to you unbidden, usually at anar-
chy-promoting events such as punk‘ shows.
Punk shows, I’ve found, are quite conducive
to thoughts of activism and revolution. _
So what was my big thought? I thought
that perhaps the United States shouldn’t be
united any longer. It’s been a great handful of
centmies, but it’s time for a change. (Gasp!
Omigod, Traci, can you believe what she just
said? Oh god, Buffy, I totally can’t believe it!
Quick, let’s go back to our sheltered lives
where we don’t have to risk thinking.
Where’s the nearest tanning salon? I’m so
stressed right now. I need, like, a manicure.
Yeah, not united. anymore, like whatever.

- Like, that’s so totally wrong.’ How could

anybody want to change? Everybody
should, like, be totally patriotic and stuﬂ’. The
United States of America is the best country

in the world, right Buffy?)

Truly, it’s a valid concern. I’m willing to
wager that all forms of government work
better on a small scale. Communism is a per-
fect example and the most obvious one that
Traci and Buffy might understand or at least
have heard of.

When you take communism to a nation-
al level, it falls apart and becomes simply
inefﬁcient, to the great disadvantage of the

. people. There are people starving in one

neighborhood, while in another, people are
simply chucking their (perfectly good) left-
overs because they’ve got too much food in
the fridge as it is. Some people are out of
work with no hope of ever obtaining decent-
paying jobs so that-they can have some dig-
nity. They’ve been cast aside by the systerrr,
trained for jobs that are now obsolete, then
stuffed away in some quiet comer where the
rest of the country doesn’t have to think
about them, and they’re thrown a small bone
by the government (read: welfare). There’s a
great social division, from class wars to
racism to sexism to age—ism. Some people
(white rniddle-aged males, who always
seem to be the bad guys, if only inadvertent-
ly) hold all the power and have all the
money, while some people are left to beg for

what they need to survive, which should be -

their birthright. Some of the impoverished
turn to crime out of desperation; if it’s the
only way you can get money to pay the rent,

buy groceries, and keep yourself and your

”democracy’ isrinevitable

family clothed  Sometimes there’s no fea-
sible alternative. .

Do any of these problems (crime,
poverty, social division, starvation, unem-
ployment, illiteracy) sound familiar? They
should.Even though I’m talking about com-
munist countries, they all apply to the United
States, which is supposed to be a haven, an
asylum, a refuge, a shelter for the oppressed
and weary. Of course, what was I thinking?
This country was started by a bunch of
white, rniddle-aged male slave owners who
all believed in patriarchal religions. But
that’s another tangent for another time.

Democracy, I think, is a pretty good sys-
tem of government. Everybody gets a say 
in theory. Everyone is part of thechoices that
affect them  in theory. Everybody is taken
care of  in theory. Democracy is similar to
communism in its beneﬁts but just run dif-
ferently. If all 50 states broke apart and each

became their its own separate democratic -

country (OK, we’ll give the socialists one of
the states to keep them happy and out of our
hair  say, Alaska?), the quality of life would
improve. It would force our politicians to
actually work for the good of the people,
which, as they often forget, is why they were
hired. There could be some problems with
currency, trade, etc., but those can all be
ironed out in time. Each state could focus on
improving itself and could move in the direc-
tion that its inhabitants want it to move in.
We wouldn’t have any need for presidents

and ridiculous scandals or for national
defense programs (read: goverr1rnent—spon-

' sored,~testosterone-ridden, trained murder-

ers) or for just about anything you can think
of that’s wrong, unjust and ineﬂicient with a
federal government. ‘
Besides, this way there would be no
more “America” What does that mean to
the rest of the world? That means no more
rude, olfensive, boorish Americans pushing
their culturally bland culture on other coun-
tries. Instead, they’d have to complain about

the rude, olfensive, boorish Marylandiansi

(I’m trying not to grin  it’s not working 
what a silly name for a state, eh?). America
wouldn’t be poking its nose where it doesn’t
‘belong (read: Israel, Sudan, Iraq, Iran, Latin
America, Vietnam, etc.) any longer. After all,
the majority of the time that the United States
has intervened in other countries’ alfairs, it’s
caused more harm than good.

I think it would be to the world’s bene-
ﬁt, as well as our own, to abandon the feder-
al system and break off into separate coun-
tries. So rally against the government

‘because “the government is lying, they’ve

done it before, and don’t you know they’ll do
it again  you give ‘em your life, they’ll give
you a stab in the back” (Anti-Flag). I

Andrea Woessner is probably a complete
hypocrite, but since she doesn’t subscribe to
the punker-than—thou philosophy, she doesn’t
have a problem with it.

The decision to move this.year’s
Pitt—West Virginia football game
from Pitt Stadium was a controver-
sial one. Oakland business owners
were (and still are) unhappy about
the prospect of losing the potential

‘customers who normally roam
around the area after Pitt games.
The students who plan to go to the
game must trade in the tickets they
bought for new Three Rivers
Stadium tickets. The move has
caused a lot of inconvenience and a
lot of complaining.

The complainers have a legiti-
mate gripe, but they’re missing the
real point here.

The problem with the game has
nothing to do with the site. Lots of
great rivalries are played on neutral
fields every year. Just last weekend,
Florida and Georgia "played in
Jacksonville, Fla. not
Gainesville, not Athens. The annual
Army-Navy game would be a great
event even if they played it in
Guatemala.’ ,

Three Rivers Stadium isn’t
exactly a neutral site, but if Pitt and
West Virginia start playing there
every year, the game might need to
be renamed the Down-the-Block
Brawl. Anyway, a catchy name does
not a rivalry make.

What makes a good rivalry are
competitive games played in front
of a lot of crazed fans_— games like
the Pitt—Penn State game earlier this
year. In college football, “crazed
fans” means students. The over-
weight shirtless men with painted
faces who. show up at Steelers
games in mid-December just don’t
go to Pitt games. Likewise, students
just don’t go to games on the day
after Thanksgiving.

Students go home for
Thanksgiving. It’s one of their few
chances to spend time with the fam-
ilies they haven’t seen since
August. That’s especially true at
Pitt, which by my own informal
count, is one of three universities in
the galaxy that doesn’t have any

form of fall break, but that’s a dif- _

ferent column.

Women's soccer advances to playoffs

. Brian Knavish
‘Assistant Sports Editor

The first two seasons in the history
of Pitt’s women’s soccer program were
ugly. I

The team amassed a combined
record of 6-28-3.

This year, the team’s third overall
and second in the Big East, the team
made the playoffs. .

“Coming from where we were the
first year when we were just not very
good at all, to be where we’re at now,
it’s really unbelievable,” explained
junior midfielder Megan Beasley, who
has been with the program from its
beginning.

The Panthers finished the regular
season with a record of 8-10 overall
and 5-6 in the Big East, which is gen-
erally regard as one of the top soccer
conferences in the country.

’ The strong season landed Pitt a
No. 6 seed in the eight—team confer-
ence tournament, which ‘opens today
whenrthe Panthers play at Syracuse.

“We are very excited,” explained
head coach Roland Sturk. “Advancing

to the postseason was our goal from
the very beginning. And to do it in
only our second year in the Big East is

team has resulted in an unexpected

a great accomplishment and shows
progress in our program.”
While it was the team’s goal, very

few people expected the team to actu-
ally make the playoffs this soon.

“Honestly, I didn’t expect it, based
on our previous season,” said sopho-
more forward Charity McClure. “But
when we got here this year, I noticed
we looked a lot better.”

Despite the high expectations, the
team got off to an all-too-farniliar start.

“We got blown out by Penn State
in the first game,” said McClure. “In
the lecture we got after the game, I
thought, ‘Oh my God, we’re going to
have a repeat of last year.’”

The team lost two of its first three
games with losses against top 25 teams
Penn State and Notre Dame sandwich
a win over Syracuse.

It was in the fourth game of the C

year, an 11-1 slaughter of Wagner, that
the players realized they had a realistic
chance of making it to the postseason.

“I couldn’t grasp the fact that we
were drilling a team,” said McClure.
“Then we beat St. John’s, and I could-
n’t believe it.”

Pitt’s crew went trick-or-treating
Saturday ‘at the Head of the
Occoquan and came back with a bag
full of medals. _

competed in the Virgina race, held
over a 3.2-mile course through

Sandy Run Regional Park.

The crewfinished its fall season
with strength,’ placing high in each
of its events. ’

The men’s lightweight eight led
the team’s finishes with a first place.

The club eight came in third,
beating all three of William and
Mary’s boats, plus Duques_ne.

The novice four also finished
third, and the championship four
came in 10th.

The women fared just as well as
the men, with their championship
four “A” boat placing first. The “B”
boat came in 19th. The crew entered
three novice women’s boats, the

-“A”, “B” and  placing ninth,

18th and 23rd respectively.

The women’s club eight finished
fourth, beating out Drexel, Loyola
and Johns Hopkins.

The team aimed to have fun this
weekend, and they did, according to
Sterling Odom, the women’s varsity

coach. Although the varsity racing
season is officially over, practices
will continue. The novices have one
race left, the Car-Du-Pitt, which
takes place 9 a.m. Nov. 7.

The novices will race against

She Said

Carnegie Mellon, Duquesne, Robert
Morris and Mercyhurst. The race is
a 2,000-meter sprint that will pre-
pare the novices for the spring sea-
son. a ‘

It also allows them to showcase
what they’ve learned during the
head season.

The points leader at the end of
the day receives a cup for their
efforts. The sprint will take place at
Washington’s Landing, the home of
Pitt crew.

Even after the Car-Du-Pitt, the
5:45 a.m. outings on the Allegheny
probably won’t stop until
Thanksgiving, when the rowing
team will practice indoors on

.machines. The practices will help

the crew stay fit during the indoor
races in January and February.

Jean Meta, the novice women’s
coach, is excited about the upcom-

. ing season.

“A lot of the rowers are staying,

and we have a large interest in the

club,” said Meta. “That gives us the
opportunity to choose from a lot of
talent and to put out really strong
boats.”

Odom explained the indoor
meets, saying, “For the indoor races,
they attach the rowing machines to
each other and to a computer. Then,
you can actually see yourself, on the
monitor, as a small boat. The other
teams are also up there, so you can
see how your boat is faring against
the others.”

All of the spring races are
sprints, in which boats compete
head-to-head instead of against the
clock.

diately followed by wins over
Villanova and Rutgers to leave the
team with a 4-2 record early in the sea-
son.

Pitt then lost three in a row before
rebounding with wins against Big East
foe Providence and cross—town rival
Duquesne.

The Panthers’ hit a skid at the end
of this season, losing five of their last
seven. But the most important thing to
the team was its spot in the Big East
playoffs. .

_Cande Ruiz has paced the team
with 26 points including 5 game win-
ning goals. McClure is second on the
team with 23 points, while freshman
Bridgid Handforth is third with 13

Despite the
unexpected suc-
cess, the team is
not taking a com-
placent attitude.

“Right now,
our initial goal is
beating Syracuse,”
said McClure.
“We lost to them
earlier this year [4—l], but that was a
game that was a lot closer than we
expected.” 1

Megan Beasley made an unselfish switch from her
usual midfield position to defense to help her team.

If Pitt beats Syracuse today, it will
play Thursday against the winner of
the Notre Dame~Connecticut game.

the assist coming from Ben Garry.
At 60:16 Kopp stepped up again
with another goal, his second, with
assists from Garry and Sikora.

The offensive show continued
when Pitt scored again at the 73:51,
when Sikora tallied goal on a break-
away shot with an assist from Kopp.

The Vulcans showed life at
76:03 when Aaron Jaecks scored for
the team’s first goal.

Pitt answered back with a goal
from Matilla on an assist from Todd
Migliore.

California came back with one
more goal. Omar McPherson scored
at 84:44. But it was too little too late
for the Vulcans, as the scoreboard
showed a final of 6-2 in favor of
Pitt.

Senior goalkeeper Chris Hanlon
played admirably in the net, in his
final game for Pitt, making six
saves.

California didn’t stick with
starting goalkeeper Chris Cardinale.

He was pulled after giving up
the first three scores, but his
replacement, Mike Hooper, didn’t
fare much better. Hooper also gave
up three goals in only 35 minutes of
play.

“We thought we had a pretty
good season coming in,” said
Luxbacher. “But we just couldn’t
get it done in the big games, and at
this level you have to get it done.”

Pitt ended the season with a 6-9-
3 record, while the Division III
California finished the campaign at
10-9-1.

Kopp, the team captain, finished
first on the team in scorring. He
ended with 22 points including nine
goals and four assists. ,

Porter and Matilla finished tied
for second with 12 points each. Both
ended with four goals and four
assists.

Spencer Barton was fourth on
the team with 11 points on three
goals and five assists T

Regan Bender rounded out the
scoring leaders with seven points.

Hanlon paced the team in goal
all season, making 49 saves and
going 5-7-1 in his 14_starts.

If you want students to come to
the game (and nobody can deny the
fact that such a goal is desirable), it
must be held on a more reasonable
date.

The main reason this year’s
game was moved is because history
has shown that when Oakland is
empty, so is Pitt Stadium. Nobody
enjoys driving in Oakland, and even
fewer people enjoy trying to park
here.

Without the students around,
there isn’t much reason for anybody
to be in Oakland for anything,
including a football game. Three
Rivers Stadium is a more conve-
nient site for a game for anybody
who lives in a part of Pittsburgh
besides Oakland. The only good
reason for keeping this game (or,
for that matter, any game) in
Oakland is because that’s where
Pitt’s campus is. But what good is a
campus without students?

The tragedy here is that the
whole discussion about the proper
site for the game could be avoided
by changing the date so that stu-
dents would be -here, and this would
look like a real campus. You’ll
notice that there was no suggestion
of moving the Penn State game to
Three Rivers. In fact, Pitt tried that
back in the ‘70s. All of the games
Pitt played at Three Rivers took
place within a week of
Thanksgiving. The experiment was
such a rousing success that after
three years, the series was moved
back to Pitt Stadium.

It’s time to move the West
Virginia game, and not just to the
north shore. It may be a tradition to
play it the day after Thanksgiving,
but that doesn’t make it an intelli-
gent decision. The date certainly
doesn’t add anything to the rivalry,
and it probably detracts from it.
Play the game a week sooner. Or a
week later. Play it on Halloween.
Make it the first game of the season.
Or the last game. Just play it when
we can watch.

Pegram emerges as a full-time starter in his senior season

Tom Camillo

Staff Writer

In his first three years in a
Pittsburgh Panther football uniform,
senior defensive tackle Kenny Pegram
spent most of his time as a backup.

He showed moments of quality
play in his many opportunities but was
never able to out—battle teammates to
earn a starting spot. Instead, he got his
starts only because of injuries to others.

But the introduction of Buddy
Morris as strength and conditioning
coach helped Pegram to realize his
potential as an athlete, which led to his
finest campaign yet in 1997 and was a
steppingstone for his thus far fantastic
1998 season.

Through seven games, Pegram has
already doubled his career total in sacks
with 3.5, and he is second on the team
with seven tackles for a loss. Before _this
season, he had 45 career tackles, and
he’s only six tackles away from sur-
passing that number in this season
alone. But despite his success, Pegram
remains modest about his personal
accomplishments.

“Overall, I think I’m doing pretty.

good, but as a whole, as a team player,
I feel I’m making more plays,” said
Pegram.

His individual success and his
accomplishments as a team player have
not gone unnoticed by the coaching

staff, who named Pegram co-defensive
MVP for the Akron, North Carolina and
Rutgers games. He has also been the
team captain for two games this year.

“’I‘hat’s a big» honor. A lot of people
don’t get that honor of being team cap-
tain. For a line- 
man to be defen-
sive captain is
pretty good,”
said Pegram.

He earned
the privilege with

man year, and
much of his suc-
cess can be
attributed to the
new coaches,
e s p e c i a 1.1 y
Morris, who has
helped Pegram
with his condi-
tioning.

“When I first started off in camp
last year, the coaches weren’t too happy
with my performance,” said Pegram.
“But thanks to Buddy Morris, I have
gotten much stronger, and that has

helped me a lot within a game, espe-

cially on double teams.”

Pegram hails from Washington,
D.C., and he said Pitt’s urban environ-
ment contributed to his decision to
become a Panther.

“Pitt is right smack dab in the city,
which is just like my high school,” said
Pegram. “I didn’t pick a school in the
suburbs because I was so used to hear-

His desireto be successful also was

a big factor in his decision.

“I was at a losing program in D.C.,
and we managed to get to the champi-
onship my senior year, “ Pegram said.
“Pitt was a losing program when I came

here, and Iwanted to help change that, .

which we started to do last year.”

Pegram’s personal success began

extremely early this year, when he
blocked two extra-point attempts
against Villanova. He is the first

Hope Austin susaects a

Panther to block an extra-point attempt
since the 1989 season. Against Virginia
Tech, Pegram deﬂected a pass that led
to an interception by Seth Homack, but
rushing the passer is not his forte.

“I think I’d rather cover the l'l1Il. It’s
the one part of the game that I think is
the most fun,” he said. “You take an
attitude, especially on the goal line in
the trenches, where nobody is going to
come up the middle between us.”

In fact, it would be hard to squeeze
anything between the six—foot-two-
inch, 275—pound ‘defensive tackle and
nose tackle Demond Gibson, who
stands at six feet four inches, 290
pounds. These two are part of the rea-
son that the Pitt defense is ranked 10th

nationally and second in the Big East.

“Being ranked is a pretty good
honor,” said Pegram. “The most impor-
tant thing is that we play hard on every
snap. If you play hard on every snap,
then good things will come from that.”

Pegram displayed some of that
intensity on Saturday in Syracuse,
where he recorded four tackles, one of

which was Pitt’s only sack of the day.

He applies his work ethic in the
classroom, as well. Pegram already has
a bachelor’s degree in communication
and he hopes to his master’s in busi-
ness. He would like to start a business
of his own one day, but for now, setting

up shop against the Temple Owls would

be just fine.

friends, and others — young
Maleeka Madison grows from seed to
bloom, learning gradually to 1o\{e
herself and to ﬁnd her place in a
world that judges people at face value.
