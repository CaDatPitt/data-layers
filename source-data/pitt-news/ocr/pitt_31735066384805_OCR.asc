Staff To Answer Unionization Question Tomorrow

By BOB LA-BRIOLA

Pitt News Staffwriter
Pitt's vice chancellor for human

resources said yesterday that the '

1,700 clerical and technical em-
ployees who will vote in tomorrow’s
union election on campus need not
endorse collective bargaining in
light of recent University com-
mittments to expand staff beneﬁts.

Gus Reinecke, whose office has
recently distributed anti-union
literature, explained that the
benefit program consists of near
free tuition for the employee and his
immediate family, a vacation plan
that includes a paid, non-working
week between Christmas and New
Year’s, hospitalization and a

retirement plan that “is better than
any offered downtown.”

In an advertisement that ap-
peared in the June 1, 1978, issue of
The Pitt News, Service Employees
International Union (SEIU) Local
925 promised to use the Univer-
sity’s offer of a seven percent pay
hike as a base on which to negotiate
the ﬁrst union contract.

Tom Cherry, labor relations
manager, stated that since the
books must balance at the end of
each fiscal year, there are a number
of alternatives that could be
implemented to generate funds to
cover pay hikes. Cherry did not rule
out the possibility of further tuition
increases and elimination of

Pitt sunbathers have been catching rays in a variety of places lately.
These dorm residents take in the sights and sun atop the Tower B sun-

0‘

services as one of those alter-
natives.

“Just because the union is voted
in, there is not necessarily a budget
increase to go along with it,” said
Cherry. “At the end of the year,
however, the University cannot be
mired in red ink, so the money will
have to come from somewhere.”

Reinecke admitted that Pitt staff
members make less salary than

other secretaries in the city. Ac-

cording to the United States
Department of Labor, the average
secretarial wage in the city was $215
a week in 1977, while the entrance
level at Pitt was $575 a month.

In Chancellor Posvar’s written
testimony to the appropriations

committee in 1975 it was learned
that employees at Pitt earn
anywhere from 17 percent to 53
percent less than comparable
employees for the Commonwealth
of Pennsylvania.

Pitt has since raised its entry level
wage, but the percentages that
were reported in 1975 would still
apply in 1978 because the
Commonwealth has given raises
comparable to the University’s.

A spokesman at Local 925
headquarters conceded that Pitt
offers its employees “a pretty
good health program,” and added
that most university programs have
increased over the years. The
spokesman added that the union, if

elected, would seek additional
beneﬁts in the areas of vision and
dental care and credit for pre-
scription drugs.

Pitt employees currently are able
to have their dental work done at the
Pitt dental-school, although some
are said to be displeased with the
fact that they must either take time
off or use one of the allotted sick
days to free themselves from work.

Reinecke also stated that Pitt has
enlisted the service of John

Sheraton Associates of Chicago to.

act as consultants for the campaign
that the Office for Human
Resources is waging to counter the
flow of pro-union literature originat-
ing from Local 925 headquarters.

Search For Marshall Replacement
Enters Into The Concluding Phase

By LEONARD ROMBERG
Pitt News Staff Writer

The search committee that was
to find a replacement for College of
Arts and Sciences (CAS) Dean
Robert Marshall has completed it’s
work.,According to Faculty of Arts
and Sciences Dean Jerome Rosen-
berg, a new dean should be
appointed in approximately two
weeks.

Four persons were recom-
mended by the committee which
began its search last March.

“The provost (Rhoten Smith)
and I are arranging to meet these
people in the next few weeks,”
Rosenberg said.

The Pitt News has learned that
the candidates are Jack Daniel,
associate CAS dean, Irwin J.
Schulman, professor of "political
science, and physics professors
John R. Townsend and Allen Janis.

Rosenberg said they were
seeking a dean “who has a
coherent view of what the college
should be, who can demonstrate
leadership in getting a program
adopted, and who can keep in mind
student interests.”

Since Dean Marshall’s resigna-
tion is effective June 30, Rosenberg
said they wanted a decision by
mid-June.

“It would be nice to have some
overlap,” he said.

The search began in March when
a campaign for candidates yielded
several dozen names. FAS Associ-
ate Dean Elizabeth Baranger was
named chairperson of the 10-mem.-
ber committee, which included
eight faculty members and two
students.

According to Josh Baylson,
committee member and Student
Government Board president, the
search was restricted to tenured
members of the Pitt faculty. Two
series of interviews were conducted
by the committee, and papers
dealing with educational issues
were submitted by the candidates.

A majority of committee mem-
bers voted for the slate given to the
provost and Dean Rosenberg.

Terming the process “a short
search,” Rosenberg said the
committee’s two-month search was
very fast. He explained that
committee members had to be
elected and appointed before the
committee could work to shorten
the list of potential candidates.

“By the first week in May, they
knew who was really interested (in
the position),” Rosenberg said.

According to Baylson, the
committee focused its interview
questions oniproblems facing
liberal arts education today,
experience with the University and

involvement with students outside
the classroom.

CAS Dean Robert Marshall’s term of
otlice ends June 30.

Other members of the search
committee were Lloyd Bond,
psychology department; Ivy
McManus, biological sciences;
Benjamin Hicks, French; Robert
Doherty, history; G.A. Stewart,
physics; Josephine Schaefer, Eng-
lish; Alexander Nehamas, philoso-
phy; Burkhart Holzner, sociology,
and Bruce Stephen, a student.

and adolescents up to the age of 18
will be admitted to Allegheny
County's Mclntyre Shelter in Ross
Township this year. They will be
children who have been- abused,
neglected or abandoned, -chronic
truants and runaways. If the past is
any indication, about half of them
will not return to their families.
Once installed in .one of
Mclntyre’s 10 cottages, some of
these children will wait weeks and
even months before they are placed
in a foster home, group home or
institution. In the meantime, they
will eat, sleep and go,t_o school on
the shelter grounds. Other than the
ﬁveor so children who will run away

each day—most of them to return
within several hours, after “loaf-
ing”» and shoplifting at nearby
stores—they will have virtually no
contact with the outside commun-
ity. Most of them will be bored
often, more than a few may be
promiscuous, and the younger and
weaker children will stand a good
chance of being physically abused
or otherwise intimidated.

Mclntyre Shelter, opened in 1969
to provide emergency care for up to
160 dependent and deprived
children, has been the focus of
considerable attention during the
past several months. Eric “James”
Doratio, who was found burned to
death in West Pike Township in
November, was a runaway from

Mclntyre. Most recently house-

parents at the shelter staged a
two-day “sick out” after a woman
employee was allegedly attacked by
a 16-year-old boy.

Critics claim the current shelter
provides seriously inadequate child
care and is often psychologically
damaging to children who are
abruptly removed from familiar
surroundings and placed in a
crowded institutional setting.

“Kids are taken out of their
community, away from friends, and
are sent to school in a trailer, ” notes
Tom Dowling, a staff member of the
Allegheny Children and Youth
Service Council (ACYSC). “The
shock can be enough for a kid to
have real developmental prob-
lems.” _ .

A protective services caseworker

for Child Welfare Services, which is
the county agency responsible for
Mclntyre Shelter, says, “Kids are
getting just as poor care there-—
being just as deprived—as they
were in some of the homes they
came from."

Overcrowding and staff short-
ages are major problems at
Mclntyre, according to persons
both inside and outside Child

Welfare Services. Cottages built for ,

16 have been required to house as
many as 22 children, with the
overﬂow sleeping on cots. At the
same time there is frequently only
one houseparent per shift assigned
to each cottage, and even when
cottage population is normal,

control is a problem.

Mclnfyre Shelter Suffers Overcrowding, Staff Shortages

(Continued from Page I)

“It makes it easy for kids to run
away and get in trouble,” says
Frank J akiel, a supervisor at the
shelter. “Houseparents can’t keep
track of 16 kids, nor can they leave
15 to look for one.”

According to an official at the
Pennsylvania Department of Public
Welfare, staffing at McIntyre
Shelter is in compliance with state
regulations. But, she admits, “the
regulations are minimal. ’ ’

McIntyre’s population and con-
trol problems can be attributed in
part to a severe lack of placement
resources and the consequently
long stays of those children who are
admitted. Foster homes for black
children are at a premium, and even
institutional homes for teen-agers
are hard to ﬁnd. According to Child
Welfare Services director Thomas
Carros, the average length of stay in
the county shelter is 30 to 45 days,
but J akiel says that average
includes infants and toddlers, who
are relatively easy to place.

‘ ‘We’re turning into a permanent
institution,” J akiel says. “Some of
these kids are here six months to a
year and even longer.”

Carros acknowledges the special
problems involved in ﬁnding homes

for older children, and as a result he
says county-operated group homes
will soon be in use as an alternative
to keeping teen-agers at Mclntyre
for extended periods.

The long-term residence of some
other children has caused increased
problems at the shelter since the
adoption of the state’s Act 41 status
offender regulations last year.
Those regulations specify that
status offenders——juveniles guilty
of non-criminal offenses such as
truancy—cannot be housed with
adjudicated delinquents (who are
held at the county's Shuman
Detention Center). Instead, many
of them now end up at McIntyre.

The result, while not. altogether
unexpected, has been signiﬁcant.
Delinquent behavior by status
offenders at the shelter has taken
the form of physical abuse of
houseparents and other children,
vandalism and widespread drug
usage. One adolescent was recently
arrested after he allegedly shot up
the inside of a Ross Township store

with an air gun, and another was

reportedly tied to the end of a bed
and beaten by other residents.
According to houseparents and
caseworkers, sexual promiscuity at

McIntyre is common and easily
observable.

Within the past few months,
three new professional counselors
have been added to the shelter staff
(there had been none previously),
but the problem persists. Removal
of an alleged delinquent requires a
court proceeding, and children who
have been abused are often afraid to
testify because they fear retaliation.
The recent “sick out” at Mclntyre
was predicated on houseparents’
claims that county officials had not
responded satisfactorily to a
situation in which unruly children
were essentially “in control” of the
shelter.

McIntyre’s critics attribute many
of the behavioral problems there to
a boredom-creating lack of recrea-
tional facilities at the shelter. But
agency director Carros believes the
solutions to these problems may be
found outside McIntyre itself.

“We recognize that with the
advent of Act 41, the mix is a
potentially undesirable one at the
shelter,” he says- “We recognize
the need to do something about
those older kids.

“More important, we're looking
at a crisis intervention unit and

money, communities developing
outreach for youthful status offend-

at the community level. If you have
any priority at all, you ought to be
looking at what you can do to help
communities deal with the problem
there, and then provide whatever
supportive services are conducive to
kids staying with their families.”

Not many child care professionals
would argue with Carros’ emphasis
on maintaining the family unit and
treating problems within the child’s
community, but the continuing use
of McIntyre Shelter causes many to
question whether those things are
really priorities in Allegheny
County. They point out that
admission to McIntyre is in fact
removal from the community, and
the location of an emergency-care
facility in a single, relatively
out-of-the-way area works against
family-child interaction.

Proposals for selling off the
Mclntyre property and establishing
a more decentralized shelter care
system have met with resistance
from the County Commissioners.
Carros himself does not necessarily
see decentralization as the answer
to McIntyre’s problems.

‘ ‘I don’t see that there’s anything
inherently wrong with a congregate
facility if the kids can get out in a
reasonable period of time,” he
says. “If they can’t, then it’s
related to coming up with
(placement) resources for the kids.
That same problem would exist
regardless of the type of facility
chosen.”

Current practice in other western
Pennsylvania localities does not
parallel that of Allegheny County,
however. Beaver, Erie, Mercer and

other counties smaller than Alle- I

gheny provide shelter care in
emergency foster homes and
community-oriented group homes.
In fact, it is generally accepted that
if Allegheny County were to close
McIntyre, the state would not allow
it to open a similar facility
elsewhere.

“Research has shown that large
facilities cause undue trauma,
especially to younger children, ” the
ACYSC’s Dowling says.

Dowling also points out that the
expansion of such decentralized
services as in-home emergency
caretaking and emergency foster
homes could have helped the county
save some of the $2 million it spent
in 1977 to operate Mclntyre Shelter.

  A Poor Choice

Pitt administrators and supporters of the Service Employees In-
ternational Union (SEIU) Local 925 have engaged in a battle of
charges and countercharges during these last weeks prior to the
representational election tomorrow.

Union supporters claim SEIU can guarantee higher wages,
maximum benefits and job security to workers with a written con-
tract. Pro-union literature stresses that the average secretary in

_ Pittsburgh earned $215 a week in 1977, while the average file clerk

earned $162.50 a week. Union spokesman compare these figures to
the starting weekly rate for secretaries at Pitt, $142.75, in 1975.

Administration representatives argue that Pitt secretaries and
technical workers already earn significant benefits—Blue Cross and
Blue Shield, major hospitalization, life insurance and almost free
tuition——which may be lost totally or partially if a contract is
negotiated. They also stress the danger of debilitating strikes and
point to the salary increases recently announced by the Board of
Trustees. Anti—union forces contend Pitt secretaries and technical
workers can gain increasing benefits from the University without
paying union dues.

Neither side has an overwhelming argument. There is no proof
the union can provide all the benefits it promises. On the other
hand, Pitt does underpay its secretarial and clerical workers; they
deserve more than they now receive.

Despite the arguments supporting unionization, we question
whether SEIU is the right union to represent Pitt staffers.
The only concern is more for staff members, and it fails to consider"
the special problems facing the University.

Pitt gets most of its money from two sources: tuition and state
appropriations. Since the Pennsylvania Legislature is unwilling to
give Pitt more funds, any money for increased staff salaries must
come from students. Of course, the union does notcare whether
this money comes from students; it doesn’t pay tuition bills.

If staff membersclect SEIU as their representative, increased
salaries and subsequent tuition increases seem inevitable. An inten-
sification of self-interested labor-management conflict could result,
with the union fighting for increased wages, the administration
fighting for low wages or high tuition and students fighting for
lower costs.

An adversarial atmosphere such as t-his cannot promote the best
learning environment. ‘ Instead, everyone would be too worried
about their selfish interests to be concerned about the primary pur-
pose of the University, which is education. Since we cannot con-
done the possible creation of such an atmosphere here, we cannot
support SEIU-’s drive for unionization.

We recognize that some effort must be made to provide staff
workers with a better wage. But mutual benefit and sacrifice in
good times and bad should be central to the operation of a univer-
sity community; Pitt’s clerical and technical workers are not living
in poverty, and under the circumstances we cannot advocate their
strictly material advancement at the expense of students, as would
be the case if the SEIU were elected.

What the staff members need is a representative willing to think
in complex terms and develop a plan that could both increase wages
and keep tuition stable. A representative interested in a broader-
based good_than that promised by the SEIU might,.for instance, at-

tempt to change the distribution of income among the different

levels of University employees. There are, we think, a number of
high-level University administrators who could well afford a
leveling down of salaries and fringe benefits in the interest of fair-
ness to Pitt staffers. The path toward that kind of redistribution
would be difficult, of course, but it would be considerably more
sensible than that offered by the SEIU.

Letters to the Editor

SE1 U ’s Campaign Rerun of 1976 I

We have another union whose
backers are trying for an election of
supportive staff at the University.
For those of us who have been
employed by the University for
more than two years, this is a rerun
of the PSEA’s 1976 attempt to
organize the supportive staff. For
those who weren’t around, or for
those who need a refresher, the
PSEA was voted down by a margin
of two to one!

Why? Because it insulted our
intelligence with propaganda, in-
fringed on our privacy at home with
calls in the evenings and bribed us
with free lunches—yet in the end it
still had no answers to our
questions. Now here we are again.

The union name has changed,
some of the faces have changed,

Busy

some of the issues have changed but
the gimmicks are the same—-insult-
ing the intelligence of the workers,
placing the emphasis of its
propaganda on only the secretarial
staff and forgetting the needs of
those who are considered technical
staff. 1

True enough we have problems at
Pitt, and true enough there are
some supporters who do not make
life easy for the staff. Then again,
wouldn’t it be easier and cheaper
(you don’t pay union dues to the Pitt
administration, do you?) to work
constructively within the system we
now have rather than putting us
back 10 years?

I certainly think so. My memory
is not so poor that I don’t remember

Signal at

how bad it used to be and how far we
have progressed.

To show you how far we have
come, I remember one staff
member who was heavily involved
in the last union campaign and who
claimed the University was threat-
ening to fire her for her
involvement. I notice her name is
on The Pitt News advertisement-
obviously’ she is still employed at
Pitt.

Ifeel I must qualify my statement
by the fact that I have written this
letter voluntarily. I am my own
person, have made my own
observations, done my own re-
search and drawn my own
conclusions. I speak for myself.

Senior Secretary

GAC

' By RODNEYB. GRIFFITH

Charles Kennedy gets excited
about his job. As he rattles off the
accomplishments of the Governor’s

[Action Center (GAC), which he

directs, the volume of his voice
rises, and he even pounds the
rostrum to emphasize some points.

Only such an enthusiastic man
dares to tackle the frustrating job
Kennedy and the 53 staff members
of the GAC face each day. They
attempt to wring some responsive-
ness from Pennsylvania’s myriad
bureaucracies.

The action center, begun by
Governor Shapp in 1973, is an
anomaly—-a bureaucracy that ad-
vocates citizens views among other
state agencies. To complete this
task, the GAC’s personnel man
phones eight hours a day, ﬁve days
a week and constantly receives
complaints from Pennsylvanians
both over the phone and by mail.

Although the center has not been
heavily publicized, scores of
disgruntled citizens use the ser-
vices. GAC phones rang 81,000
times in February and 69,200 times
in March. Callers often complain
about busy phone lines at the GAC.

After receiving a complaint, the
work of staff members just begins.
Staffers butt heads with bureau-
crats, arguing the citizens’ points
of view. To wrench some response
from administrators who are
convinced they know what is best in
their specialized ﬁeld takes some

‘teeth pulling and cajoling, but
much of the time GAC gets results.

Last year nearly 75 percent of
citizens’ complaints were resolved
to the resident's satisfaction.

PERSPECTIVE

No agency except the action
council or a similar advocate or
ombudsman seems able to guaran-
tee bureaucratic responsiveness.
Individual bureaucracies certainly
cannot police themselves to insure
that citizens always receive fair
treatment.

Modern bureaucracies create an
atmosphere in which administra-
tors become concerned only with
enforcing regulations. Bureaucrats
often forget the purpose of rules
and arbitrarily impose decisions
without thinking about the possible
effects. In such an environment
only an outside agency with clout
such as GAC can safeguard an
individual’s right.

Despite the essential role GAC
plays within state government, it
exists without any solid founda-
tions. Employees receive salaries
from a web of sources including
Comprehensive Employment and
Training Act, Title XX and various
state departments such as Penn
Dot.

Since GAC’s employees are
protected by neither civil service
nor patronage, staff members are
in a very perilous job position_
Nothing prevents the sudden end
of any job in the center. At any time
the ax can fall, and nothing could
stop the dissolution of GAC.

At this moment, the center exists
because of Shapp’s, good will, and
no Legislative act guarantees the
perpetual existance of it. When
Shapp’s reign ends in November,
GAC could also disappear unless
the new Governor decides to
continue the program.

fir

“Emu; .

.»»- “Z.

--r

Kennedy’s main concern now is ‘

to convince state power brokers
that the GAC should exist in the
future. He has contacted state
legislators, future key policy
makers and even the gubernatorial
candidates to try to protect the
future of the center.

He has invited the candidates for
Governor and Lieutenant Governor
to attend a conference on advocate
agencies and governor’s ombuds-
men in September. Kennedy hopes
the candidates or their representa-
tivés will attend to give some sign
about their opinions on an advocacy
service.

Kennedy believes no Governor
can ignore the need for some
advocate or ombudsman.

“This is a trend,” he said. “The
public has come to demand
government responsiveness.”

Hopefully, Kennedy is right. The
Govemor’s Action Center seems to
be one of the few good ideas
Shapp has had. Any sensible new
Governor should promote this
agency, which helps make govern-
ment a little more humane. At the
cost of only nine cents a citizen
each year,,,GAC might be one of the
best buys in Harrisburg.

pproach Seventh Game With Super Confidence

Sonics A

By The Associated Press

SEATTLE - The Seattle Super-
Sonics are conﬁdent they can erase
the memory of the "worst loss in the
history of the National Basketball
Association championship series
and bounce back to win the title by
beating the Washington Bullets
tomorrow night.

“There’s no question I’ll get
another championship ring tomor-
row,” predicted Sonics forward
Paul Silas, who won two of those
baubles of basketball supremacy as
a member of the Boston Celtics.

What about the lopsided nature
of Washington’s 117-82 victory
Sunday, the ﬁrst blowout of the

best-of-seven series, which is now
tied at three victories a piece?

“The Bullets wanted to win so
badly they came out smoking,”
said Silas. “With us, we knew even
if we lost, we would have another
chance.”

That chance comes tomorrow
night before a sellout crowd of
14,098 at the cozy Seattle Center
Coliseum, where the Sonics have
won 22 in a row.

“We’ll have the advantage
playing at home,” said Sonics
Coach Lenny Wilkens. “And you
can be sure we’ll play better than
we played Sunday. That was the

Sports

worst game we've played in a long
time and it’s not going to happen
again.

“We’ll be back. We’ll be up for
tomorrow’s game. We’ll go out and
play our game, execute on defense
-and win.”

Sonics’ Fred Brown also was not
discouraged by the 35-point loss in
which Seattle shot 33.7 percent and
was outrebounded 83-59.

“lt’s one of those things that

happens in basketball,” he said
with a shrug. “All our shots
bounced out. Rebounds bounced
the other way. Everything went
their way. If Washington assistant
coach Bernie Bickerstaff had gotten
in, he’d have done well, too.”

What about game seven tomor-
row? “We’ll be the smart money,”
replied Brown. “I’m not a betting
man, though. I’m a Sonics’ man.”

“There’s no doubt in anyone’s
mind we’ll win tomorrow," echoed
playmaker Gus Williams. “We’ve
come through when we needed the
big game and we’ll come through
tomorrow.”

To do so they’ll have to counter
Washington’s dominance under
the boards, which was built in part
when coach Dick Motta went to a
lineup of one guard and four front
courtment. It was a move made of
necessity because of the sprained
left wrist suffered by guard Kevin
Grevey, Washington’s most pro-
ductive backcourt player.

It’s something the Sonics can
expect to see more of tomorrow.

“We had used that alignment
during the regular season,” said
Motta. “But we didn’t practice it
for this series.”

Expos Can Expect Excellence Very Soon

By TOM KUKUCKA
Pitt News Staff Writer

Dick Williams, manager of the
Montreal Expos, smiled as he sat in
the dugout at Three Rivers Stadium
“and watched his team’s lively
inﬁeld practice before the final
game of the recent Pirates-Expos
weekend series.

“Excellent. The attitude here
has been outstanding,” Williams
said. “We’ve got a blend of young
talent and some veterans like
(Dave) Cash, (Tony) Perez and
(Chris) Speier; they have been
around for quite awhile. My young
outﬁeld, catcher and third baseman
help create a mixture that blends in
very well.” A

Williams had a right to be happy
about his team—a 15-1 slaughter of
the Pirates the night before had
Three Rivers boobirds chanting and
plotting against Pirate skipper
Chuck Tanner. The Expos exploded
for 20 hits off four Buc pitchers,
while pitcher Rudy May stymied the
Pirates on two hits.

The Expos also looked impressive
in their 2-1 loss in the series opener
as Steve Rodgers allowed just.six
hits in going the distance, and the
Expos’ defense frustrated Pirate
hitters on several occasions.

That has been the Expos’
problem so far, according to
Williams—the highly touted hitting
of spring has failed to complement
the surprising pitching and
defense.

“Pitching ‘has been excellent,”
Williams said before the Sunday
ﬁnale. “We haven’t been hitting.
We have had a day or two where we
get a lot of hits and then go into a
drought for about a week.”

Williams’s lamenting proved
true, as the Expos lost Sunday, 5-2,
and the joy of the 15-1 win was
cancelled by two close losses.

“We arejust one game over .500
in a close division,” Williams said.
“The main thing is that hitting has
hurt us while the pitching—both
starting and bullpen——has been
excellent”:

Still, the potential the Expos
exuded this past weekend was
impressive—a far cry from the days
when Boots Day, Coco Laboy and
Enzo Hernandez ruled the diamond
in Montreal.

The Expos have the hitting and
the defense; Cash is an excellent
leadoff man and Perez is still
durable at first base. Speier at
shortstop, Gary Carter handling the
catching and Larry Parrish at third
round out an inﬁeld of talent and
experience.

Andre Dawson, Warren Cromar-
tie and Ellis Valentine hit and ﬁeld
equally well.

The starting pitching staff of
Rudy May, Steve Rodgers and Ross
Grimsley has performed well to
date, and Darold Knowles, Wayne
Twitchell and Dan Schatzeder have
done the job in the bullpen. The
Expos are currently in third place,
two and one-half games off the
pace.

The Expos could be a good bet for
a gambling man. The Phillies and
Pirates are easily the favorites in the
East, but this particular division
boasted good teams in 1970, when
the Pirates won the division with 89
wins, and in 1973, when the Mets
won ‘while barely clearing the .500
mark.

 

If the Pirates and Phillies
continue the horrible seasons they
have had so far, the Expos could
push ahead in a three- or four-team
race and squeak into the champion-

  

ship series in October.
Realistically, the Expos are a
couple years away from a division
title (then, so were the ’69 Mets),
but hot t ak in Au ust and

0 The 1978' Rose Bowl proved to be the most
lucrative of all the college post-season games, as 26
schools divided a record $13.8 million (compared to
$11.6 million in 1977).

Washington and Michigan divided $4.1 million,
which was by far the biggest payoff, more than
double the amount split by Notre Dame and Texas
for the Cotton Bowl.

The Pacific Eight Conference had the best record
in the bowl games with a 3-0 slate, good enough to
earn $2.4 million in revenue. The Big Ten was not
able to win any of the three bowl games in which its
universities participated, but came away with $3.1
million, which was more than any other conference.

No wonder Woody and Bo never seem to get tired
of losing bowl games. i

0 Elliott Walker recently joined former teammates
Randy Holloway and Tom Brzoza as the first mem-
bers of the 1978 Pitt Panther draftees to sign
professional contracts. Walker, a sixth-round pick,
signed a series of one-year contracts with the San
Francisco 49ers.

0 Larry Holmes, who will meet Ken Norton for the
World Boxing Council heavyweight crown on Friday
night, wanted to clarify his relationship with his up-
coming opponent.

“Muhammad Ali used to tell people he didn’t like
a guy just to build up the gate,” said Holmes.

“I’m not doing that. I really can’t stand the
chumn.”

0 Pitt’s all-time leading scorer, Larry Harris will -

undoubtedly be among the choices when the NBA

holds its 32nd annual draft Friday. Early in the
season, Harris was touted by one scout as “an early

 

it known they are in the market for a shooting for-
ward. Kansas City, Portland (which has three first-
round picks), Atlanta, New Orleans and Philadelphia
could all use someone with an outside touch like
Harris’s.

0 The Sixers are reported to be actively seeking In-
diana’s first-round choice (the first in the entire
draft) in order to bring North Carolina’s Phil Ford
into the City of Brotherly Love. A combination of
Lloyd Free, George McGinnis and draft choices are
what is being offered to the Pacers. If the Sixers fail
to make a deal with Indiana, the Pacers are expected
to select 6-10 Mychal Thompsor. from Minnesota,
clearing the way for Kansas City to choose Ford on
the second pick.

0 Of the 26 teams in the Major Leagues, only the
Oakland A’s (who lead the American League in

pitching) have lower team batting averages than the
Pirates. When do the optimistic ramblings of
Manager Chuck Tanner about the Pirates’ hitting
cease being harmless cheerleading tactics and start’
becoming lies?

0 During the eight years that baseball fans have
voted on the starting lineups for the All-Star game,
Cincinnati catcher Johnny Bench has received well
over 16 million votes, more than any player in the
Majors, while Rod Carew finished second with better
than 14 million votes. How anyone could believe
that Bench is better at his position than Carew is at
his is simply unbelieveable.

0 One reason for Montreal’s domination of
professional hockey is the way the Canadiens have
been able to stockpile high draft choices and thus
keep a steady flow of young talent into the
organization. Over the past 10 years Montreal has
made 30 first-round draft choices, while the Boston
Bruins rank second with only 11 choices.

Roach Found Transition Difficult

By KAREN KADILAK
Pitt News Staff Writer
Although he set school records in
both the indoor and outdoor pole
vault competition,
Roach wasn’t exactly satisﬁed with
the way he performed this past

$638011 .

“I didn’t have as good a year as I
wanted,” said the freshman from
Washington, Pa., whose last vault
this season came over the weekend
in the Central Collegiate Cham-
pionships in Ann Arbor, Mich.

Roach, who broke school records
with an indoor vault of 14-10%: and
an outdoor vault of 15-1/2 , found the
transition from high school to
college competition difﬁcult.

“It wasn’t technique as much as
the whole atmospherein general,”
he said. “I know the starting
heights bothered me.
school I was used to vaulting 13
feet on my ﬁrst try. Here I was
sometimes vaulting 14-6 on my first
attempt. It made a difference.

“Earlier in the season, every-
thing bothered me,” he continued.
“I couldn't get accustomed to the
starting heights and I had to break
in a new pole. Then, I had to get
used to the competition.”

It was also Roach’s ﬁrst time
vaulting indoors.-

“That was different,” he said.
“I don’t like it as much as I do
vaulting outdoors. I know the wind
bothers some of the vaulters when
they do it outdoors, but I kind of
like it. It gives me a better drive.

“I didn’t particularly like vault-
ing inside the Fieldhouse, either,”
he added. “I felt boxed in where
they have the pole vault situated.”

With his first season behind him,
Roach has one thing on his
mind—-concentrating on next sea-
