.A Pitt News survey of the stu-
dent body taken just two days
prior to tomorrow's Student Gov-
ernment election indicates a
trend toward an ISA victory. Of
the 27 students polled, over one-
third said that they would sup-
port the platform of the Indepen-
dent Students Association, which
is headed by candidates ‘Scott
Baum and Jeff Bar.. /

Coming in a close second, the
Students ‘Toward Progress cap-
tured the support of 22 per cent
of those studentssurveyed in the
random sampling. FARCE follow-
ed with 15 per cent, ‘while Geof-
frey Bauman‘s S_DS party had no
support. ,

Apathy. however. seems to be a
major factor in this election. Ac-
cording to the survey. 22 per cent
of_ the students are indifferent
about who will serve on Student
Government. This figure indicates
a continuation of the apathetic
trend which has become evident
in past Student Government elec-
tions. The 1967 SG election saw"
3.100 votes cast. Last year the fig-
ure dropped to approximately 2.-
500. about 35 per cent of the u'n-
dergraduate enrollment.

not supporting) candidates are
many and varied. Tom Ziff, a
freshman history major indicates
that he will support the ISA slate
on the basis of personal acquain-
tance with the candidates.

Another freshman, Richard Sei-
del, a philosophy major, also in-
dicates that he will vote ISA. Sei-
del qualified his choice, however,
saying. "I am voting straight ISA
because I can't be well acquaint-
ed with all of the candidates of
each particular party. I think my
best bet is to choose the party
platform that in general gives me
what I want, and that party is
ISA.

Two sophomores, Bob Davis
and-Bob Lederman, expressed ap-
proval of Scott Baum‘s visit to
their fraternity, SAM. Davis com-
mented, "Baum is the only can-
didate I‘ve heard. He impressed
on us that he wants to" make
changes in the school and that he
wants the student body to become
more involved than it is now. Al-
so, I think that the ISA senatorial

candidates are good people.”

One STP supporter, Jim Han-
sen, a junior mechanical. engi-
neering major, has been Student
Government president at the
Bradford Regional ‘Campus for
two years. Economics major Ra_de_
Manolovich indicates that he will

' Albert Camus believed that life
was absurd. And if the conduct of this
year’s Student Government election is
valid evidence, Mr. Camus’ observa-
. tion is enlightening. Presidential, vice-
 presidential, and senatorial candidates
' have been chattering for the past week
about the need of Student Government
' to be representative of the students.

 One candidate says vote for me

" and I will abolish the "language re-

fquirement. Another personsays that

his party’s slate of senatorial candi-

gjdates will do the job because they are_
"i really good people who have a great

deal of interest in student politics and

.;,university governance. We’ve heard

1’ this poppycock for years.

The respective presidential candi-
[dates have made such an impact on the
student body that the latest WPGH
poll indicates that some 47 per cent
of the student body are still unde-
Icided. The great student masses are
finow pondering their fate. In an atmos-
fphere of supreme mundanity, can an
‘intelligent choice be made?

-- lWhile the choices between the
‘candidates are now difficult to make,
we feel that a negative vote on ab-
;,,stention, on the part of the student
voters, is quite a bit more absurd than
-the election campaign. Our choice
‘in this campaign is Scott Baum of the
-ISA party. We cannot for a minute
say‘ that Baum is the ideal SG presi-
_den_tial prospect. But compared to the
other candidates — senatorial and pres-
idential alike — Baum is the only stu-
‘dent who, in our view, could conceiv-

 The ISA party platform and some
of Baum’s proposals are seemingly un-
feasible, but compared to the simplis-
tic platitudes of the STP party, they
shine in the light of brilliance.

I _. }. The ISA party platform and Baum’s
campaign proposals have some pros-
pect for success, while the positions
of. Mr. O‘Neil have no real basis in
-in reality. On the empirical scale, most
of O‘Neil’s positions have failed in
A the past. Beyond this, Mr. O’Neil’s

 

 aum For President

mind is empty of practical Student
Government experience. When asked
what was the most important specific
issue of this Student Government cam-
paign, O’Neil remained silent while
his running-mate Bill Chrisner chim-

ed, “Student Power.” We feel that an-

SG presidential nominee should have
some opinion of what is the most im-
portant issue in his campaign.

Unlike his opponent, Scott Baum
has attempted to discuss the issue -
racism and the basic rights of students
in an open and intelligent manner.
But our endorsement of Mr. Baum has
its reservations. The present structure
of Student Government is archaic. SG
exists in a vacuous state. Structures like
the Student Government Senate serve
no useful pupose and should be abol-
ished immediately in favor of a cabi-
net structure which would provide
continuity and responsible researched

pressure.

The Pitt News can endorse Scott
Baum for the post of SG president, but
we cannot back any of the senatorial
candidates. Most of them, it seems,
are more interested "in their personal
records and the empty glory of the SG
Senate than in giving their dubious
services to the University.

There are probably a great many.
students who are now quite dismayed
by this campaign. But we ask all stu- .

dents to sit back and think for just one
minute. Think about the respective
candidates. Think about their persua-
siveness. Think about their positions.
And think about the future of the Uni-

- ver-sity. Think.

The members of the editorial board
of The Pitt News have been thinking
along these linesfor almost a week.
We have conducted extensive inter-
views with Steve O’Neil of the STP
and Scott Baum of the ISA. And last
night we voted unanimously to en-
dorse Scott Baum. Without his victory
tomorrow, we arejconvinced that SG
will slowly disintegrate. Without a
victory tomorrow, SG will be represen-
tative of student ignorance and tim-
idity.

 

 

.‘,_,Editor, The Pitt News,
 I I read with great interest and nau-
 ‘sea the articles on ROTC in one of your
 - 1;".-November issues. Like Barry Uhlen-
f’ hake, I, too, am an ROTC graduate from
.,,f"-another university and speak from .lim-
k,-g", ited experience about the program and
‘ its benefits. ,
First, let me‘ say I don’t feel, after
reading all the articles, that the under-
lying cause is accreditation or control
V but rather this seems to be just another
f-'—.’.“Anti” from the young "intelligentsia”
" .. of our universities. It is another tie-in
E: j_.with the Vietnam War, anti-government,
and anti-society attitudes. By diminish-
_ ing the effectiveness of the ROTC pro-
57 ‘gram, you provide another thorn in the
“ side of the “establishment.”

 To hide behind a facade of lack of
Qcontrol, awarding the rank of assistant
' professor, that the program is pre—pro-
jvfesfsional training, etc.,— is ridiculous.
;,;;First, doesn’t the state legislature
"ha_ve._some say on your curriculum?

  

  

 

  
    
   
  

Certainly they are an outside body as
the Department of Defense is. Second,

‘Dr. Holland’s article doesn’t’point out
that 95% of all ROTC graduates don’t
make the military a career and in fact
are trained with the reserve connota-
tion foremost.

I could go on and on but suffice it to
say, I took ROTC, I was glad I received
credit for it, and I feel it was much more
deserving of credits than being Presi-
dent of my Senior Class (which I was)
or other campus organizations and the
benefits to the individual (which is after
all what ROTC and Pitt are trying to
strive toward) can be measured only

Lastly, I doubt that this letter will
be published by "One of America’s
Great Student Newspapers" which in
fact, as far as I can tell, belongs in the
nearest “Trash Only" container.

The Drummersi

 

Bureaucratic B.S.

by BRUCE LEVENSON
A Staff News Editor

Last Wednesday night The Pitt News
went begging for its own news.

Again.
Six members of the staff stayed up all

" night in the newspaper offices awaiting

word on what was taking place in the
Computer Center. We waited until 5:30
a.m. '

The Black Action Society and the
Chancellor reached an agreement at 3 a.m.

No one contacted The Pitt News.

A member ofthe BAS
recently told me that
the list of their de-
mands appearing in last
Thursday's special edi-
tion were inaccurate.

THAT IS TO be ex-
pected when a college
newspaper m u s t a c -
quire a story about its
own school second
hand.

The Chancellor was ‘so kind as to in-
form the Pittsburgh Press, the Post-Ga-
zette, and United Press International of
the 3 o‘clock agreement.

But notlTh'e Pitt News. '

We had to get our information from
UPI, second hand.

THE CHANCELLOR a n d his men
could give a damn about the student body.
Just as long as the city is able to retain its
image of "good kindly Wes" and “liberal
old‘Pitt."

The staff of The Pitt News felt an ob—,

ligation. as newsmen, to the student body.
We believed that it was .our duty to pub-
lish last Thursday (not a regular publica-
tion day) so that the University commun-
‘ity would be aware of what had transpired
in the Computer Center.

I have to chuckle when I recall one of
the deans telling me something in Septem-
ber, about “getting the student involved."

Well, here are involved students—six of
them. Holed up all night in the Student
Union, losing a night of sleep, not doing
any homework, working on a special edi-
tion, a paper we were under no obligation
to print. In short, it was effort above and
beyond the call of duty.

 

  

iVie<wpointe=

 
 

 

Do you know how The Pitt News found
out about the Universitys new building
plans‘? We read about them in the Pitts-
burgh Press one Sunday. Our best report-
er. who was promised that he wou_ld be
contacted about this news when the in-
formation was ready to be made public.
was not notified until after the article.

THIS ADMINISTRATION has been
feeding the students a crock of BS for too
long. The Chancellor is not concerned with
students. He cares only about images and
publicity. The administration is not tuned
in to the thoughts of the student but to the
thoughts of the city of Pittsburgh.

Publicity, especially bad publicity, is
what makes the administration jump. And
how they jump! Especially Dr. Posvar.

The administation bent over backwards
to satisfy the demands of the then newly-
formed BAS this past summer. The usual-
ly lethargic bureaucrats rushed into ac-
tion after receiving a shot of adrenalin-
some unfavorable‘ publicity. The BAS had
contacted the news media. The Chancel-
lor couldn’t allow the community to think
that the University was really a "racist
institution."

It wasn‘t the hardships of the black stu-
dents that motivated compliance with BAS
demands. For these injustices had always
existed and nothing had previously been
done about them. The concern was not
with a body of students, but with publicit-
ty. (Had to keep up the old “liberal“
image you know.)

AND IT WAS publicity again that
forced the Chancellor to sign the latest
list of BAS demands. (Can’t have a San
Francisco State or Columbia here.)

When Tom McKenzie. the student who
had the buttons cut from his coat by a
ROTC officer, was having his mail tam-
pered with, nary a sound was heard com-

ing from the administration. But, at the _

same period of time, when Alternatives
was printing “obscenities,” -the adrenalin
of the bureaucracy began to flow, hot and
heavy. For there was Robert "White
Knight" Duggan threatening all kinds of
dire consequences behind the scenes.

In summary, the administration is

mired in all kinds of bureaucratic BS. If '

it was half as concerned with students as

it is with publicity, we may not have had

the black_students' demonstration.

 

On John Galbraith

 

 

by DON MARBURY
, Staff News Editor

John Kenneth Galbraith, renowned eco-
nomist, author, and public speaker. spoke
here Thursday, on some of the political.
and socio-economic problems facing to-
day’s world. Galbraith felt that economic
progress, and emancipation has been the
inherent social problem in the United
States. He pointed out that these have been
some of the primary reasons for racial dis-
turbances in the country. I would tend to
agree with this, but I would add, a point
that Mr. Galbraith seemed to avoid dur-
ing his speech, and that is that just plain
bigotry and apathy. have been basic rea-
sons for the black revolution too.

Galbraith characterized himself as an
"old fashion liberal integrationist." His
own solution to the racial problem in the
U.S. was. that the government must take"
measures to promote black economic pro-
gress right away. But he flatly stated that
he could not see social groups living
apart.

HE DID NOT pursue this thinking too
much further. but his statement leaves
many questions unanswered such as: if the
government were to establish a huge mul-
ti-million dollar program to promote eco-
nomic advancement in the black and other
deprived communities. as he suggested.
which would establish something lik e
black capitalism. what would keep the
community for naturally. and inadvertant-
ly becoming separistic in nature‘?

I think his idea of the government pro-
moting minority capitalism ona huge scale
is a good idea.‘ but i-t doesn't really touch‘

 

' on one of the basic problems of racial un-
rest, which is racial imbalence.

GALBRAITH WAS highly critical of
our foreign policy.'He suggested that on
the whole the U.S. has not looked at its for-
eign policies realistically. “We must face
the idea squarely that we are going to have
to deal with other countries. These coun-
tries are part of our world, and we must
find some association with them. We can-
not deny their existence," Galbraith em-
phasized. I find this reasoning especially
pliablein the case of Red China, where
the US has been doing just what Galbraith
said we can‘t do, which is deny their exis-
tence. Galbraith's reasoning does present
a problem to the government. because if
they do consider it, then they are faced
with the decision in many cases of what
is more important. national pride. or world
peace? I

Galbraith also related his ideas on the
revolution occurring among young whites
in the country. He felt that through them
many of the basic problems inherent in our
society were brought out into the open.

HE BLAMED THEIR revolution on
the establishment. and its indifference to
the individual and his goals and desires.
Mr. Galbraith has a very good point here.
for up until today. the establishment or
status quo of things. has only been con-
cerned with substituting bureaucratic
ideals for true human ideals. '

Galbraith touched on many of the prob-
lems facing the US and the world. always
with a touch of sacrasm. whilestill retain- ‘D

For any piece of art to “last”
for any appreciable length of time
it must be both an extension of the
artist and the audience. The degree
to which audience can relate to a
work, whether it be a ilm, a
painting, a novel or a ’song will

determine just how “successful” I

the work is. The greater the num-

. ber of participants: the bigger the

hit.

Such a fatuous value system as
this is most frustrating to the art-
ist who above all else must to his
own self remain true. Aiming at a
generalized audience almost al-
ways leads to raffish diluted ma-

' terial and in the long run to cul-

tural stagnation. It is most exigent
therefore in our technological, ex-
panded society that the artist be
the sole interpreter in the initial
’ stages of any production and that
the finished product be solely

an extension of that artist’s genius.

In other words the artist is just
as important (if not more so) as
the piece of art. Hopefully such a
system would place greater de-
mands on the audience by expos-
ing them to a phantasmagoria
of style and form in response to
which they must serve rather than
dictate.

In the past quite a few Rock
artists have followed avarient of
the above. Some have found it
very rewarding as in the case of

Contact
lenses are made
of modern plas-
tics. which have en-
tirely different charac-
teristics than the tissues
and fluids of the eye. Conse-
quently your eye cannot handle

.this foreign object without help.

So, in order to correct for

' Mother Nature's lack of foresight,
you have to use lens solutions to
"make your contacts and your eyes

'-7.'.,~§ ‘compatible.

_' _ , . There was a time when you
‘.3;-,i‘_needed two or more separate

  
  
   
   

—solutions 10
properly mod-
ily and care
for your con-
tacts, making

them ready for

your eyes. But now
there's Lensine from

the makers Of‘.

Murine. Lensine.

A for contact com-

fort and convenience.

Lensine is the one solution

for complete contact lens care.

Just a drop or two of Lensine coats

and Iubricates your lens. This al-

lows the lens to float more freely
in the natural fluids of your eye.

Why? Because Lensine is an ‘‘iso- ,

tonic" solution, very much like

your own tears. Lensine is com-
patible with the‘ eye. -
Cleaning your contacts with

Lensine retards the build-up of

foreign deposits on the lenses.

And soaking your contacts in
Lensine between wearing periods
assures you of proper lens hy-
giene. You get a free soaking-stor-
age casewilh‘ individual lehs com-
pa-‘itments on the bottom of every
bottleof Lensine.

It has been demonstrated that
improper storage between wear-
ings permits the growth of bac-
teria on the lenses. This is a sure
cause of eye irritation and, in
some cases, can endanger your
vision. Bacteria cannot grow in
Lensine because it's sterile, self-
sanitizing, and antiseptic.

.. Let caring, for your
contacts be as conven-
ient as wearing ,thern:
Get some Lensine . ..

Bob Dylan, the Stones, the Bea-
tles and most recently the MC-5.
Others, simply hurt their heads
against brick walls — Van Dyke

Parks, Dino Valente, Jefferson
Airplane, and the Grateful Dead.

Of course in the end the audi-
ence buys only what it likes and
I guess that’s only right; but in
buying, the audience should try
and learn something about the
artist and what he is trying to do.
Education ofthe masses is the
first step in any cultural revolu-
tion.

Two albums which might face
trouble in being “accepted” and
yet deserve to be listened to are
Hedge & Donna 2(ST-107) and
Randy Newman (RS-6286). Hedge
and Donna are a husband and
wife gig who rely on the simplici-
ty of their voices and the strength
of their song. The album is
strange in that it doesn’t try to
cop in on any of the latest fads.
The arrangements are well cal-
culated and never obtrusive.

Whereas .Hedge & Donna 2
stands a half decent chance of
making it, Randy Newman does
not. Randy Newman is a terrific
compose'r_(“I Think It’s Going
To Rain Today”) but his arrange-
ments, strongly influenced by
Van Dyke Parks, are simply too
far ahead of their time. The- or-
chestration seems chaotic but_ this
is only because it is structured
around the verse meter and in fact
acts much like italics does in
print. The album is fascinating in
its complexity and originality,
and must be taken with a strong
measure of understanding.

 

 

On the other hand two albums
that try to maneuver in the gen-
eralized stream of Rock apprecia-
tion and end up drowning are
The Purpose (ABCS-622) and the
Buddy Miles Express - Express
Way to Your Skull (SR-61196).
The Purpose is a Tom Wilson fias-
co, a man who once spent his time
setting trends and now just goes
around chasing them. Supposedly
the Purpose is the blues but it
takes a lot of imagination to make
it fit. Some of the songs on here
are just unbelievably bad such as
"Hippie Chick” and “Hog For

- You Baby.” If you take all the

hype going around about the Bud-
dy" Miles Express and simply ne-
gate it all you’ll have some idea
as to what their album is like.
The only good cut is “Wrap It
Up” which if nothing else rocks.
This album turns you off in much
the same way a bust across the hall
would. Lock your door.‘

Some things you should want to
get your head into: Stained Glass
Window - Crazy Horse Roads
(ST—154), showing more imagi-na-
tion this time Deep Purple —
Book of Taliesyn (T-107), Sal-
vation Gyspy_ Carnival Caravan

(A'BCS- 653) and Grandalf (ST-' .

  John K. Galbraith: M

By MIKE EDELSTEIN
Staff News Writer

Much as the Cathedral of
Learning dominates the Oakland
skyline, Harvard's eclectic 6’8"
professor John Kenneth Galbraith
towered over the University of
Pittsburgh student body when he
spoke to an overflowing crowd
of admirers on Thursday, Jan.
16.

But drawing more than super-
ficial parallels to the 60-year

-old intellectual is difficult. he is

too much the unique creation of a
prolific mind. The man of subtle
quips can be labeled many things,
professor, economist, social the-
orist, Presidential advisor, am-
bassador, critic and politician
among them, but he prefers to
be known as an author.

In his noon address, morning
news conference, luncheon dis-
cussion, afternoon address to
the Americans for Democratic
Action, and evening Roosevelt’s

’Day address, Dr. Galbraith at-

tempted to define the “common
denominator” of intellectual al-
ienation, political arousal and
violence in the cities: ‘The role
of the individual in an advanced
industrial state.”

In the next four to eight years,

' Dr. Galbraith warned, “We must

come to grips politically with the
problem that is posed by the mil-
itary and industrial bureaucracy.
The test of a candidate from now
on must be his willingness to face
this task.”

As’ an example of the unrespon-
siveness of government bureauc-
racy, Dr. Galbraith cited the new
budget. With a de-escalation of
Vietnam war costs imminent,
military allocations have been
made for new “gadgets,” such as
an anti—ballistic missile. The re-
sult: “For the first time in his-
tory, peace may be more expen-
sive than war itself

Contrary to what is often as-
sumed, Dr. Galbraith noted, Am-
erican political action emerges
from_the Pentagon and Industry,
is given to the President, and im-
posed on Congress and the Ameri-
can people. This makes for gov-

ernment policies which “serve,
not the individual desire, abut
bureaucratic desire.”

To the Harvard professor, Viet-
nam illustrates the “tendency
of bureaucracy to substitute "of-
ficial truth for TRUTH.” The war
has been run on the “Rostow-
Alsop Aesop’s Fable — Nothing
brings you to the brink of victory
like a series of defeats.” No ad-
mirer of the “Jeffersonian Sai-
gon government,” Dr. Galbraith
sees the two stumbling blocks to

As a nationalistic force, the Viet

  §Fitzgerald Field House
5 Where It’s Happening

by Roy Jacobs Sport Editor

TXIIIIIZIIIZIIIZIZIIIIIIIIIZIZI.

Scouting around the Field House . . . or . . . can Buzz
find the answer to Pitt's basketball Ridl?

The pieces of the Frank Kush story may be starting to
fall in place. Kush reportedly accepted the position with
the notion that, among other things, he could. get players
admitted with 700 combined college boards and that the
business school was being reinstituted. During a luncheon
meeting with former Athletic Director Frank Carver, Kush
had several misconceptions cleared up. He then hopped a
quick plane to Tempe, Arizona, never to be Pitt coach
again. .
In terms of good news, for the first
time since the 1963-64 season, Pitt will 
have several of its remaining basketball 
games broadcast live on commercial radio. A 5
WEEP-FM, 108 on your radio dial, will
carry live the Field House games with
Westminster tomorrow night, West Vir-
ginia (January 28) and Penn State (Febru-
ary 22), as well as an away game at Car-
negie-Mellon, March 1. One question: where does that
leave Bob Freschi and the WPGH sports team?

Incidently, ’there’s a Frank Kush at Pitt anyway. He’s
‘ a-first - year medical student.

This writer will go on record as guessing that Wyo-
ming’s Lloyd Eaton will also turn down the head coaching
job if he was offered it when he visited campus yester-
day. The best bet now is Darrell Mudra, an outstanding
coach who guided Arizona to an 8-2 season before quitting.
The fact that he’s out of work and already missed out on
the Oklahoma State job make this offer, if forthcoming,
more appealing. I

It was reported yesterday that Tom Mueseler, former ‘
_ Latrobe High School basketball star, is headed towards
Duquesne after becoming disenchanted with Clemson Uni-
versity. Late last term, Mueseler was reportedly very in-
terested in Pitt: Question: did he lose interest or is there
another one of those interesting Pitt athletic stories?

West Virginia Likely Target
In Gymnasts’ Home Opener

It’s been a rough road for the gym team so far, losing three
straight away meets. The squad opens its home season tomor
row night at Trees Hall at 7:30 p.m. with a good chance to pick up its
first win of the season, against West Virginia.

-‘‘They’ll be one ofaour better chances to win,” ventured gym coach
Warren Neiger, who also cited Syracuse, Kent State, and Slippery
Rock as other possibilities.

“For years before last year,” he added’i“we had beaten them.”
West Virginia clipped the gymnasts 133.20 to 125.05 last season.

“We feel we have agood chance,” said Neiger. “But if they’re us-
ing freshmen, I might reverse that judgment.” The varsity is not per-
mitted to use frosh by the E.l.G.A. and would be at a disadvantage if
WVU used theirs.

West Virginia coach Bill Bonsall feels his squad is also in a good
position to win. “We should be strong on the rings and the horizontal
bar,” predicted Bonsall. “We’re weak on our floor exercises, but we
should be in good shape otherwise.”

_. Although Bonsall feels he is weak ‘in the floor exercise, his entry

Mermen Drop Meet to W V U, 
Wessel Sets New Pool Mark  

By MARTIN HELLMAN

The Mountaineers of West Virginia University benefited
from an ECAC ruling in their 61-43 victory over the varsity

tankmen lastnight at Trees Pool.

Because Pitt is a member of the ECAC, coach Bill Grant is not
allowed to use freshmen swimmers in competition. WVU, being an in-

dependent school, may use its
frosh in all of their meets in ac-
cord with an NCAA ruling.

Coach Kevin Gilson of WVU
admitted after the meet, “I used
freshmen but he (Grant) didn't.
It’s a shame; it would have made
a big difference in the outcome
of the meet.”

Two outstanding performances
were turned in by the Pitt frosh in
their exhibition races. Tom Hayes
beat everyone in the 50-yd. free-
style with a time of 22.8. Also,

  
   

the 400-yd. freestyle relay team
set a school freshman record
with ‘a time of 3:27:7 in the
event.

The medley relay team com-
prised of Bill Tome, Gene Hoff-
man, Richard Norris, and How-
ard Norris surprised the Moun-
ties at the start of the meet. Their
victory over the WVU relay squad
gave the varsity an unexpected
7-0 lead.

Grant was extremely pleased
with this race. “That is the best
time that we have made so far this

- year,” he remarked. Gilson said,

“Pitt did a better job than I had
anticipated.”

Dave Wessel again thrilled the
audience with his spectacular
diving in both the one and three
meter events. He broke his own
school record set last week
against Bucknell and also set a
new Trees Pool mark in the one
meter dive. His total of 249.50
points eclipsed the existing mark
held by Mike Barnhill of Indiana
State University.

The three meterldive was not
counted in the point totals for this
meet because WVU does not
have a three meter diving board
at their pool.

A Petrini Strives to Regain Touch

by ART ROSENGARTEN

The hardest road to travel
is the comeback trail. Once
you are a success and then lose
it, the path back is a rough one.
Bob Petrini of the basketball team
is now attempting this journey.

Petrini, a junior, has suffered
many ups and downs in his short
time at Pitt. Coming from power-
ful DeMatha High School in
Washington D.C., he quickly
sparkled on Tim Gugurich’s fresh-
man squad. .

“Tim helped me adjust fro
playing a forward to the guard
position,” Bob explained. “He
made me think like a guard and
like a leader. He’s great on indi-
vidual work.”

“When I came here, I didn’t
think that anyone could beat me.
I was real cocky,” expressed Pe-
trini. “It’s funny how this place
has helped me lose my confi-
dence. Everybody keeps drilling
losing into me.”

Bob feels that the losing atti-
tude began to grip him in his
sophomore year, when he was
playing under Bob Timmons.
Even though he scored over 170
points for the season, Petrini be-
gan to play less and less as the
season progressed.

“When I stopped playing. I
quickly grew out of shape and
lostmy confidence. As my confi-
dence went, -so did my attitude,”
___said Bob sadly. “As I played less,
the more I got down on myself.
The turning point was the Miami
game, from then on it was all
down hill.” ‘

The lack of attitude among the
players last season seemed to be
the major reason for last season’s

dismal effort, according to Petrini.

“If we had the attitude last year
that we have this year, we would
have won at least 15 games.

“‘Everyone goes out_ there this

 

year trying to win,” continued
Bob. “I myself can feel the
change. We’re putting our full ef-
fort into it. Coach Ridl is great
at keeping our attitude up.”

Bob feels that Ridl’s presence
has helped the team tremendous-

-ly, even if the team’s current re-

cord doesn’t seem to prove him
out. “We really like Ridl. He’s
got guts. If he gets the talent
here, he’ll win.”

After missing eight games and
most of fall practice with a nag-
ging back injury, Petrini is just
beginning to get back into shape.
If the Panthers are to reach re-
spectability the rest of this season,
a good deal will depend upon Bob’s
comeback.

“Our big’ problem is that we
don’t have the big man. Right
now, We’re just five average guys

 

without a truely great one to car-
ry us,” he explained. “We have
been getting the good shots, it’s
just that everybody is missing. I
hope that I can help change the
situation a little.” ~

For Bob, his major problem is
regaining his lost confidence. As he
puts it, “It'll take a really good
game to restore my confidence. I
have been hitting in practice, but
it’s completely different when
you’re on the‘ road before 9,000
people. That’s where it counts.”

With a new attitude and a wel-
comeed maturity, Bob Petrini is
beginning his fight back to the
top. All he feels that he needs are
a few breaksto go his.way for a
change. Afterall, he was a winner
before, and there is no reason why
he can’t become a winner again.

Titanlic) Battle

Cubs Await Big Game

By BILL NAAB
“I wish that we could play against teams like Robert Mor-
ris all season,” stated freshman basketball coach Tim Grgu-

rich.

Although the Panther basketball Cubs have lost their only game of
the season to the mighty Robert Morris Colonials, Grugrich believes,

that the opposition from the
strong teams could mold his
young players into a great squad.
“Westminster. Robert Morris,
West Virginia, Youngstown, and
Duquesne are the best clubs for us
to play against,” said Grgurich.

Tomorrow night at the Field
House the Cubs get a chance to
play against one of the strong-
er squads on their schedule —

the Little Titans of Westminster.»

The game begins at 6:15 before
the varsity battle between the
same, two schools. Grgurich does-
n’t expect a- huge experience gap
between the two freshman
squads. He believes that West-
minster has played about five
games whereas Robert Morris
had played 11 games before last
Monday’s contest.

Grgurich praised his squad for
their determined effort against
the undefeated Robert Morris Co-
lonials. “If Paul O’Gorek hadn’t

Tight Games
Open Dorm
Basketball

Dormitory intramural basket-
ball season started off with a full
slate of contests featuring a wide
variety of basketball. Winning by

big m a r gin s were Stratford .

House, House of the Rising Sun,
and House of Lords, while Ran-
dom House, Sutherland House
and Pleasure Palace pulled out
tough victories.

In Monday night‘s first three
games, Stratford beat Keystone
House, 43-34, Random got by Haw-
thorne House, 29-24, and
Pleasure Palace squeaked by
Playboys Penthouse, 48-44. The
second round of contests found
the House of Lords clobbering
the Men from Madhouse, 40-22,
the House of the Rising Sun tromp-
ing over Panther House, 45-24,
and Sutherland House pulling out
a 46-43 victory over the Peanuts
Gallery.

Taking scoring honors for the
victorious Stratford House was
J. D. Lewis with 16 points, while
Mike Bannon led the losers with
12. High scorer in the Pleasure
Palace win was Steve Solonicke
with 18, while Chuck Lawrence
led Random House with nine,
second only to Hawt-horne’s .John
Thissin who had 10 points. Tim
O’Rurke had 14 for« Pleasure
Palace.

High scorer for the night was
Dan Lynn of the House of Lords,
who pumped in 22, while John
Hollosy of Sutherland House fin-
ished with 18.

fouled out, we would’ve had a good
chance to win,” Grgurich specu-
lated. O’Gorek fouled out during a
vital Cub surge. They had just nar-
rowed the gap to 63-58 with about
five minutes remaining.

In addition, the coach stated
that O’Gorek played the Colonials’
6’l0” Larry Ketvirtis even up.
Ketvirtis scored six of his 18
points when O’Gorek was on the
bench. “We could rebound with
them, and both teams did a good
job on the boards. There were very
few tip-ins,” Grgurich said.

Since Robert Morris showed
their might by whipping West Vir-
ginia on the Mountaineers’ home
court by an eight point margin,
Grgurich is still encouraged de-
spite last week’s 15 point loss.
“It was a good,experience playing
Robert Morris. The team plays
up ‘to their potential when they
meet a really tough club. Lots of
the Robert Morris players are
older and one year of college ball
makes a big difference.

Grgurich mentioned that his
squad should continually improve
throughout the season. “We’ll
have a better picture of our ball-
club in the next couple of weeks.
We’ll be playing two games a
week for just about the remain-
der of the season,” Grgurich re-
marked. ’

By the time that the green Cubs
(2-1) meet arch-‘rivals Duquesne
and West Virginia on the last few
days of January, the club should
have an a d e q u a t e number of

games under their belt. Mona-
ca’s Mickey Davis of Duquesne
and Laurel Highlands’ Will Robin-
son of West Virginia will highlight
the strong freshmen squads.

Moreover, Westminster may
find it difficult to upend the Cubs’
splendid balanced scoring attack.
Bob Cizmarik, Kent Scott, Steve
Lewis, Paul O’Gorek and others
are prepared for a rugged shoot-
out.

 

By JERRY L. GRUEBEL

The last team the hoop-
sters beat was Westminster.
That was a month and a half
and nine games ago in the first
round of the annual Steel Bowl.
Tonight, Westminster invades-
Pittsburgh again.

After the hoopsters edged the
Titans, 59-52, Dec. 6, basketball

‘coach Buzz Ridl thought he was on

theiwinning track. The victory had
lifted the cager mark to two wins
against only one loss. But tonight,
the cagers put their dismal 2-10,
record against the team Ridl
coached the previous 12 years. ’

"We’re going to start a string
wins,” said Ridl. "What can I
say?”

Westminster brings an 8-4
season mark to the Field House,
including six wins in their last
eight contests. They’ll be led
by the two players who gave -the
cagers the most trouble in the
first meeting, Tony “Buppy”
DeJoseph and Russ Boston.

"They’ll bél coming at us like
the last time,” said Ridl. “But
we’ll play them the same way as
before. We’ll mix our defenses.”

DeJoseph pumped in 20 points
against the cagers, but Ridl will
not use any new tactics to con-
tain the Titan guard.

“He’s a real good shooter,”
explained Ridl. “He’s going to get
his share of points.”

In eight of the A Titan’s 12
games, DeJoseph has scored 20

points or.,..better. The 6-2 guard’s

overall scoring pace is 19 points
per game this season.

Boston, who dropped in 12
points against the cagers has
since raised his scoring pace to
16.8 points per game. Boston is
only 6-2, but gave the cagers
plenty of problems under the
boards in the Steel Bowl contest.

BUZZ RIDL
Faces Old Team Again

But Ridl has more than West-
minster to worry about. The cag-
ers haven’t been able to put the
ball in the basket despite the de-
liberate offense that the new coach
installed in the attack. The cag-
er shooting percentage has been
mediocre at best since the start
of the season.

‘Buzz’ Hopes Hoopsters Can
Victimize Westminster Again

 

The biggest disappointment 

forward Mike Patcher. "

"He ought to be scoring bet-j
ter,” moaned Ridl in disbel‘i,ef,g
“He’s been hesitant, but at least“

he took nine shots against Penn

State. That’s better than only two’

or three.”

Two games ago, Patcher failed-
to score against Temple and only 
attempted two field goals. Against 4 
the Lions, the Johnstown junior"~T_;.i
took nine shots but only hit t_w 

of them. ~.

“Now he needs to drop them in,i’}'-'9',

continued Ridl. “And with his

moves he should be getting to the’ ,1
foul line more. I won’t be sa'tis-, 

fied until he does."

When the cagers face West- _ -T]
minster tonight, Ridl hopes Patch"-J 
er and the rest of his-players find:
their shooting eyes. They’re go-,
ing to have to if they want their,
third victory. The Titans have‘,

been shooting at a 44% clip and av-‘

eraging 74.3 points per ‘game;

this season.

THE DARK
SIDE OF
THE HOUSE

Yale David Koskofl
and Richard Goidhurst

in 1949 in the city of Pittsburgh, a house
burglar named Millard Wright was con-
victed of his fourth offense. According to
Pennsylvania legal statutes, he faced life
imprisonment as an habitual criminal. This
terrifying prospect led him to an attempted
suicide and then commitment to a hospital
for the criminally insane. At this point", Dr.
Yale David Koskoﬁ, a neurosurgeon in
Pittsburgh, was approached by Wright's
lawyer, a well-known attorney named
Louis Little. Little suggested that Millard
Wright would be willing to submit to a
lobotomy — an operation which severs the
frontal lobes of the brain—in hopes of cur-
ing his criminal behavior. Little thought
that as a volunteer for this drastic psycho-
surgery, Wright would be performing a
public service that could very well encour-
age a judge to lessen his sentence.

Dr. Koskoﬁ agreed to participate if the
court gave its approval. Up to then, a lo-
botomy had never been performed on an
individual whosc brain was not known to
be organically damaged or who was not
