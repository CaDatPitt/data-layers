Army, Navy Release Joint Plan
To Use Colleges For Training

Released last Thursday by the Army and Navy was a joint statement planning to train ap»
proximately 250,000 young men in colleges and universities throughout the country.

Both plans state that the educational training will be carried on while the men are on active
duty, in uniform, receiving pay, and under general military discipline.

The Armed Services will contract with colleges and universities which will furnish to the men
selected by the Services housing and messing facilities and instruction in curricula prescribed by

the Services.

The University has applied for these contracts and has submitted a questionnaire stating that
Pitt can supply classroom facilities for 2,500 men, and of this number can feed and house l,600.
Following are the plans of both the Army and Navy complete as of December 17. All further
developments and clarifications in the respective plans will be published in The Pitt News as

soon as they are released.

War Program For Men, Women

Shortly after Pearl Harbor and the declai-~
ation of war, the University at once began
to gear itself to the war effort. As a result.
Vice-Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald is now
able to announce a wartime program for
Pitt that will not only cooperate with the
government’s need to train young men and
women for war service immediately but will
also keep alive the long’ range liberal arts
tradition in American education.

This is the program planned by the Board
of Dean‘ and the Senate Committees of the
University:

The University and the high schools will
co-operate to give able youths as much edu~
cation as possible by the time they are
eighteen years old. One practical way will
be to admit selected students to college at
the end of the third high school year. On
November twenty-third the Educational

Policies Commission of the National Educa-
tional Association and the American Asso-
ciation of School Administrators recom-
mended that the “seventeen-year-old stu-
dents of ability who have reached senior
standing in high school be permitted to en—
ter college or university immediately and
earn a high school diploma and credit for a
yaar in the higher institution at the same
time.”

The educational training of men and wom-
en in the ﬁelds which have sl1orta,<zes will
go forward at full speed. The divisions of
the University concerned in this training:
are Medicine, Dentistry, Engineering, Nurs-
ing‘, Pharmacy, the sciences, and Mathemat-
ics. The shortage in these ﬁelds should keep
enrollments at the maximum.

The University will help in every possible

Army Plan . . .

Objective of the Plan

The objective of the plan is to meet the
need of the Army for the specialized tech-
nical training of soldiers on active duty for
certain Army tasks for which its own train-
ing; facilities are insuﬁicent in extent or
character.

To that end, the Army will contract with
selected colleges and universities for the use
of their facilities and faculties in eﬂ"ectin,<2,'
such training of selected soldiers in courses
prescribed by the Army. The plan will en~
able the Army to make a selection for this
training‘ of qualiﬁed young men on a broad
demociatic basis without regard to ﬁnan-
cial resources.

Designation ot Soldiers for
Training

(1) In general the selection of’ soldiers for
such training will be made from enlisted
(selectee or enlisteel men who have com-
pleted or are completing their basic military
training‘ and \vho apply for selection for
specialized training‘.

(2) The selection of enlisted men for such
further training‘ will follow the general plan
for the selection of enlisted men for Officers
Candidate Schools with such additional meth-
ods of a~certaining qualiﬁcations as may
be deemed appropriate after‘ consultation
with the American Council on l*lducatio'n.

(3) All such selections will

be under
War Department control. a

(4) No enlisted man who has passed his
22nd birthday will be eligible for selection
under this program, except for an advanced
stage of technical training.

 Plan ..   . 

General Purposes _ s . V

Inorder to_ provide a continuing supply of
officer candidates in the various_ special
ﬁelds .required by the U. S. Navy,il\'larine'
Corps, and. Coast Guard. a new plan for
using the ,facilitics_ of selected colleges and
unive1*sities, ‘for. training" for Naval Service,
has been ‘established. . _

Under this plan selected high school grad-
uates, or others of satisfactory educational
qualfhﬁcations,,_havii::g established their prop-
er ‘mental, physical, and potential oﬁicer
qualifications by appropriate examinations,
will be inducted in the Navy as apprentice
seamenor privates, U. S. Marine Corps, as
appr_opriate, placed on active duty with pay,
and aisliigned to designated colleges and uni-
versities to follow ‘courses of study speciﬁed
by the Navy Departm_e_nt.. . , I ,

This plan will _pern1it selection of the
cour.t,ry’s best qualiﬁed young men on a
broad democratic basis. without ifegard to
ﬁrancialrcsources. and thus permit the
Navy to induct and train young men o'f su-
perior ability for officers and Specialists. 2

Present Probationary

Commissioned Students

At a date to be announced shortly, stu-
dents now holding probationary commissions,
on inactive duty in a deferred status. in the
U.S.N.R. will be permitted to resign and
accept assignment to the ‘College Training
Program as apprentice seamen on active
duty. At the satisfactory completion of their
prescribed professional education they will
again be commissioned in the U.S.N.R.

Selection of Trainees

(1) High School graduates, or students
having equivalent formal education who will
have attained their 17th but not their 20th
birthdays at the time of enlistment or in-
duction will be eligible for this program.
Enlisted or inducted men with the above edu-
cational qualiﬁcations, who will have reach-
ed their 17th but not their 23rd birthdays,

these requirements are advised not to apply.

(3) Procedures for the selection of stu-
dents, in conformity with the President’s
Executive Order on Manpower, dated De-
cember 5, 1942, are being prepared by the
Bureau of Naval Personnel. Information
covering these procedures will be made avail-
able in the future.

(4) Successful candidates will be permit-
ted to indicate their preference as to colleges
to which they wish to be assigned, and these
preferences will be respected insofar as pos-
sible, within geographical limits and student
avalability within the area. No guarantees,
however, can be made that a student’s re-
quest for a given institution will be granted.

(5) Students will be permitted to express
preliminary choice of the branch of service
including the Marine Corps and Coast Guard
at the time of assignment to- the Navy Col-
lege program, but this choice will not be
binding. Final assignment will be based
upon demonstrated ability and counseling
during the first two semesters.

(6) The various geographical areas of the
country will be assigned quotas on the basis
of population.

(7) Men assigned to this program may at
their own request be transferred to Class
V-5 at any time if otherwise qualiﬁed. Men
in Class V-5 may be transferred as needed
to specialized» aviation cadet training at any
time during their year of training under this
program.

Arrangements with the ‘Colleges

(1) Contracts with the institutions will
provide -for training, housing, feeding, and
medical service.

The contract with the institution will in-
sure a deﬁnite minimum number of men.

Students may or may not be housed in
groups, depending upon local conditions. It
is the responsibility of the institution to see
that satisfactory feeding and housing is
maintained. The institution’s contract will
cover the cost of the same.

( 2) The Navy will furnish each institu-
tion at least one officer for purposes of naval
administration.

General instructions for discipline and
routine will be issued by the Bureau of Naval
Personnel, in order that procedures may be
standardized insofar as local conditions will
permit.

( 3) A cooperating institution will be re-
quired to accept men ordered to it for train-
ing. At the same time each institution will be
spend full time in completing their college
training according to the following schedule:
expected to maintain high standards of se-
lectivity in examinations. instruction, etc..
and to recommend transfer to other duty
of students who fail to meet these standards.

Curricula and Requirements for
Training

The Navy will prescribe the curricula
which are necessary to insure production of
oﬂicer material for the various branches of
Naval Service, including aviation cadet,
engineer and deck oﬂicers. engineer special;
ists, medical and dental ofiicers. Supply
Corps officers, and -Chaplains.

Curricula will vary in length, depending
on training requirements. With the excep-
tion of medical and dental ofiicers. engineer-
ing specialists, and chaplains, the length will
be from two to six equivalent semesters.

(1) Courses for the first two sixteen-week
terms or the equivalent will be similar for
all students and will emphasize ‘fundamental
college work in mathematics. science, Eng-
lish, history, drawing and physical train-
ing. All students inducted in the new Navy
College Training Program will receive in-
struction in naval organization and general
naval orientation. The amount of time de-
voted to this work will not exceed three
class hours per week during the first two
semesters.

Outlines of all curricula will be prepared
by the Bureau of Naval Personnel. with such
assistance as may be required from repre-
sentative educators or educational societies.

(2) If the college is satisﬁed that the stu-
dent has adequately covered any of the sub-
jects included in the curricula. proper sub-
stitutes will be permitted.

(3) The Navy will give achievement ex-
aminations at the end of the first two terms.
The result of these examinations will be

used in determining further assignments.

(4) Any student who fails to maintain a
satisfactory standing in the course will be
dropped for college and transferred to oth-
er naval duty.

Assignment at Completion of
Training

Upon satisfactory completion of college
training all students will be assigned to ap-
propriate specialized training in the Navy,
Marine Corps or Coast Guard. Selection for
this training will be on student pref-
erence, counseling, and acceptance by the
service concerned. If found qualiﬁed upon
completion of this training. they will be
commissioned in the appropriate Reserve.

way to improve the skills of men and women

in Pittsburgh industry who need training at
college, professional, or graduate level. (The
Cuitiss-Wright Corporation has worked out
a plan for training 1,000 young women who
have had two years of college work. The
entire project will be financed by that cor-
poration.)

The University will give college courses
for young women needed in work. The five
fields of work are: ( 1) Armed Services-—
WAACS, WAVES, etc.: (2) Industry; (3)
Social Service; (for example, one of the
problems of putting ﬁve million women to
work in industry by the end of 1943 will be
the care of 500,000 babies.) (4) Government
positions; (5) Teachers (young women must
be trained for this shortage).

The University is doing research work for
the government at the present time. It will
continue these emergency research contracts.

The University has offered its services for
the Navy Training Program which was an-
nounced to the American Council on Educa-
tion, December 12. 1942. (Contract not yet
awarded.)

The University has offered its services for
the Army Training Program which was an-
nounced to the American Council on Educa-
tion, December 12, 1942. (contract not yet
awarded.)

The University will continue its usual pro-
gram. There will be young men in the Uni-
versity who cannot pass the physical ex-
aminations for the services and young wom-
en not in the service. These two groups will
go on in the usual program. They will be
important in keeping alive the tradition of
liberal arts.

The University will continue with the
present E.S.M.W.T. program. 3,313 are en-
rolled in the E.S.M.W.T. program: 2,354
men and 959 women. This work is non-credit
but the University of Pittsburgh and many
other universities have been giving E.S.M.
W.T. as a service to the government. ,
