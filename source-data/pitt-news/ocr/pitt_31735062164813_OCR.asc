Need for Aid

Gwilym A. Price, chair-
man of the Board of Trus-
tees, stated that the Univer-
sity’s current operating def-
icit totals $19,500,000 and
that the University needs
“instant state aid,” not bank
loans, which the State Council of
Higher Education suggested last
week.

Price said that the University’s

' working capital deﬁcit is exclu-

sive of its building cost debt,
since the building debit is self-
amortized. .
The University has had a cash
and operating deﬁcit since 1960.
Last year’s operating deﬁcit was
$4.5 million and the cash deﬁcit
was $5 million, Price reported.
‘He said trustees were compell-
ed to reach into research grants
in order’ to help pay’ bills.
Although new building con-
struction was financed mainly
with state and private funds, he
explained, ‘the cost of moving
was very high and was paid out
of operating expenses.
The University has $193 million
in assets and_ $70‘ million in en-

dowments, but since these are ’ '

frozen assets the University re-
quires an additional $2.5 million
annually, Price revealed. '
The University borrowed $10
million from the Equitable Life
Insurance Society of America in
1961 and an additional $5 mil-
lion in 1963. So far the Universi-
ty has repaid $1 million of its
$14 million debt, he pointed out.
Price stated that the University
borrowed the -$14 million because

University T0 Meet Payroll
With Loan To Cover Deficit
Board of Trustees Decides
To Borrow on State Aid

The. Board, of Trustees

’ voted Monday‘ to borrow

$1.25 million from two Pitts-
burgh banks to meet its
June 30 payroll.

The Mellon National Bank and

‘ Trust Co‘. and the Pittsburgh Na-

tional Bank have agreed to lend
themoney jointly at the lowest
possible interest" rate in .antici-
pation that the state legislature
will pass favorably on the emer-

» gency appropriation_ for the Uni-

versity.

Gwilym A. Price, trustee chair.-
man, said that the University
had to have the money yesterday
to meet its payroll and other

current bills. The state legisla-
ture cannot possibly complete ac-

tion until today. .
Price said the money will be

repaid as soon as the cash is re-

ceived" from the emergency ap-
propriation. -

He said the bank loan was ac-
cepted rather than an offer by
an outside ﬁnancial group be-
cause the bank loan was offered
at the prime rate,’ 4% per cent
per annum, while the other offer
was at a rate more than twice
this. -

The anticipated emergency ap-A

propriation from the legislature
is the only‘ collateral required
by the banks, whereas the out-

side group wanted the Universi--

ty to pledge its next regular state
appropriation as collateral.
“To borrow against our regu-
lar appropriation would simply
create another deﬁcit situation
later this year, because that mon-
ey will be needed as soon as re-
ceived,” Price pointed out.

Scranton   Advocates
University - State Ties

Governor William W. Scranton stated in a televised

Continued on Page 2

interview lastweek, that the state would make a mistake

by converting‘ the University entirely into a state school;
instead he favors a’ state related University without a com-

plete takeover.

Explaining his view, ‘Governor, Scranton stated, “I
would caution people in wanting to have (the University) taken over
completely as a state university, for this one reason: the University
of Pittsburghhas gotten a tremendous amount of private. help, pri-
marily from the Pittsburgh area, but some from elsewhere. _I would
not like to have that shut off to the University and its "growth po-
tential because it was taken over by the State.”

Governor Scranton felt that the University’s ﬁnancial crisis is .a
‘ “temporary situation.” Although

stated that, ,“we’re anxious to try

The Governor ' added that _a
long-range plan should be work-
ed out by the State Board of Ed-
ucation and its component State
Council of Higher Education.

- In‘ conclusion,_ Governor Scran-
ton stated that “my personal feel-
ing is that it would be good to
have a state ‘relationship with the
University—-some kind of state

Dean Crafts Resigns;

Slippery Rock’s Dean  

Named as Replacement

By LINDA GOLDSTEIN

Dean of Men William B. Crafts has resigned his posi-

tion to accept a post as- dean of students at Monmouth

College in Monmouth, Illinois.

Herbert McGibbony, presently dean of students at
Slippery Rock State College, will assume duties as Univer-

sity dean of men Aug. 1. McGi

 

‘DEAN CRAFTS
Accepts New Post

WRYT Taps
I Dean Rush.
For Honor

_ Local radio station WRYT has
chosen Helen Pool Rush, dean of
students and.dean of women, as
the citizen of the week for the
week beginning last Sunday.
The honor, bestowed each week
upon a deserving resident of the
Pittsburgh area, cited Dean Rush
for her “contribution to the Uni-
versity, the youth of Allegheny-

many years through her work at
numerous professional and civic
posts.”

The awards also praised Dean
Rush for being listed in Who's.
Who in America and for being
cited by Governor William W.
Scranton as a Distinguished
Daughter of Pennsylvania.

“It came as .a complete sur-
prise,” commented Dean Rush
on the award for which she was
nominated by John Loch, direc-
tor of the Student Union. “It is
a great honor and I appreciate

it"

bbony, a University graduate,

has almost completed work for
his doctorate in educational ad-
ministration. He was formerly an
instructor .in the University’s
physical education department.

When asked why he had ac-

cepted this offer after refusing '

several other ones, Dean Crafts
explained that no other proposed
position was “so appealing. I
couldn't say no to it.” .

Dean Crafts is a graduate of
Brown University which, like
Monmouth, is a. small school pri-
marily concerned with liberal
arts. . '

Dean Crafts’ new position rep-

resents to him “an opportunity
for more responsibility. I’ll be in

the same type of situation but

will have additional contact with

the students,” he added. He is V

also looking forward to working

with the new" president of the p  '-

college, whose ideas on students

and personnel ‘coincide with his .

OWD.

Another attraction of his new
post is the possibility of teach-
ing on a limited basis. ‘.‘By teach-
ing one course, the dean knows
how the other half lives—-name-
ly the faculty,” Dean Crafts
noted.

Dean Crafts will be the first
dean of ‘students at Monmouth
College. Commenting on the
trend for smaller ‘institutions to
go to the larger schools to select
top administrative officials, Dean
Crafts added that the University
“has been a natural proving
ground for
administrators.”

The factor of experience at the
University was one of the attrac-

tions Dean Crafts presented to
the officials of Monmouth Col-

lege. In addition to a raise in .

salary and a professional boost,
the excitement of his new posi-
tion appealed to him. “I’m the
kind of person who likes to have
a new set of challenges every so
often,” Dean Crafts concluded.

On the fern-covered stage,
often with his foot casually
propped -on a chair, Josh
White, Jr.,' performed ap-
pealingly before the audi-
ence that crowded the main
ballroom of the Student Union
Thursday evening at the opening
of ;1965 Spring Weekend. Intro-
duced' by Terry Lutz, Spring
Weekend chairman, White’s pro-
gram of folk songs and humor
rated an encore‘ at the evening's
end.

“You could call his father the

ers,” mentioned Chuck Ramsey,
White’s road manager, and the
young entertainer lived up to his
forebear’s reputation. Whether
thoughtfully singing his version

forming “Fair Thee Well,” or
singing with the audience, White
received warm applause after
each performance. _

By comic quips _in song, and
an undaunted way of handling
trouble, White achieved audience

v contact. “I must lead a charmed
life,” he said sarcastically after
wrestling with a slanting mike,
_an untuned guitar, and a pop-
ping string from his instrument.

Fred Mazurek, the Uni-
versity’s _startin g quarter-
‘ back for two -yearsand cen-
terﬁelder for three years,
has deceided to take his
chances in professional foot-
ball with the Washington Red-
skins. The Redskins and the bon-
us of law school outweighed a
prospectively bright future in
' professional baseball. ,

Mazurek, whose .466 average
was the second best in collegiate
baseball this year, was drafted
by the Minnesota Twins in the
class A round of the Major
League draft“ several weeks ago.
Mazurek hinted that the Red-
skin offer of ﬁnancing his way
‘ through law school deterred him

from signing withthe Twins.‘
“If it ;wasn’t for law school,
I’d be playing baseball next
year," said Mazurek. Another
' reason that might have inﬂuenced
him was not being drafted by

Minnesota in a higher round.

earning him the attention of Washington Redskin coach Bill McPeak.
The Redskins recently signed Mazurek and plan to use him as a

000 bonus offer to sign with the
Philadelphia Phillies.

“Fred’s not being drafted in a ‘

higher round is really perplex-
ing,” said teammate Doug Cham-
bers, who just signed with the
St.
agent. “I think he’s one of the

greatest I’ve ever seen in college’

ball.

“We went to watch .a Pirates .

Fred was nervous . the whole
time. I really felt sorry for him
when I found out what happen-

zurek. “They probably thought

Mazurek was not originally

of his baseball potential and ﬁve-

don't think I'm too small to play
