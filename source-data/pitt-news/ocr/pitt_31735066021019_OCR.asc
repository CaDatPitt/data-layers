An alternative view of abortion

By Erik Kridle

Staff Writer

[This is the second in a two-
part series. ] _

Mary Litman, of Women's
Health Services, believes in what
she is doing. She is a business-
woman. She says her business is
helping confused women make
important choices.

Others like Mary Scanlon from
Operation Rescue say she is a
”killer.”

”We send women home from
right inside our clinic who have
changed their minds,” Litman
said, ”but anybody who has
made up [her] mind, ‘Yes, I'm
really firm. I'm going to terminate

 

this pregnancy,’ is not going to let
people standing, blocking the
doorway to a clinic, change [her]
mind.

”Women used to risk their lives
to terminate an unwanted preg-
nancy and have an abortion, and
did risk their lives over and over
and over.

”So, they — Operation Rescue
people — are there,” she said.
”They are effective in getting me
dia coverage. They are effective
in making themselves feel like
they are doing the right thing, but
they don't stop women from hav-
ing abortions.”

Litman admitted that she had
had an abortion before it was le-

”I was not married. I was very
poor, or would have been poor,
although I had a decent job.

”I came from a poor farm fami-

meant to me a limited life and

”It was a difficult decision,”
she said.

The abortion was to leave her
physically unable to bear
children.

March 17.

The teach—in is designed to
educate students about abor-

educated decision about at-
tending an April 9 pro—choice
rally in Washington D.C., ac-
cording to Stacy Finke of the
Campus Women's Organi-

According to Jeanne Clark,

in the rally.

The teach-in, which will be
held in Pitt's Graduate School
of Public Health building, will
kick off on Friday, March 17,
with personal stories from stu-

Pitt students and local resi-
dents will help raise money for
the research of amyloidosis,
the disease that killed former
Pittsburgh Mayor Richard S.
Caliguiri. _

This Saturday, March 4,
from 10 a.m. until 12:30 p.m.,
the Pittsburgh Figure Skating
Club, in conjunction with Citi-
parks, is hosting a Skate-a-thon
in honor of the Richard S.
Caliguiri Fund for Amy|oido-
sis Research at the Schenley
Ice Rink.

Pitt skates for charity

People who are interestedin '

raising money must acquire a
pledge sheet, available at the
Schenley Ice Rink during regu-
lar operating hours. Sponsors’
names and pledges must be
collected prior to the event so
that they may be brought
directly to the rink.

Any skater raising a mini-
mum of $10 in donations is in-
vited to participate in the
event, with the top five
money-raisers eligible to win
prizes — including gift certifi-
cates, an autographed Steelers
football, a pennant au-
tographed by the Penguins,
and other exciting prizes.

Interns receive on-the-job jobs  

By Cindy O’Leary

For The Pitt News

Internships give students the
opportunity to gain valuable
work experience under the super-
vision of a professional in a chos-
en field of study. There are over
300 internship opportunities
available on file at the Pitt Intern-
ship Office, approximately 20 of
which are directly affiliated with
the university itself.

The office has current informa-
tion concerning available intern-
ships and helps students with the
application process. Aid is also
given to help with relations be-
tween the student, his or her
faculty sponsor and the field su-

pervisor.

Internships are offered in every
major, and self-designed intern-
ships are also possible. Available
within the university are positions
with the University Outreach Pro-
gram, WPTS-FM, the University
Times, Student Service Health
Education Office and the Office
of Student Activities, to name a
few.

An internship allows a student
to experience a situation which
involves entry-level exposure to
a career in which he or she is in-
terested. It can give the student
the chance to develop new skills,
discover what a particular career
demands and become more
aware of where his or her in-

terests and abilities lie.

Many students who choose to
become interns at the university
often do so for convenience.
However, university internships
are valued by prospective em-
ployers as much as off—campus in-
ternships.

Many graduates have found
that an internship helped them
form contacts leading to job op-
portunities.

Junior Samantha Pyzola in-
terned last semester at Pitt Stadi-
um in the University Sports
Information Office. As a commu-
nications major, Pyzola chose
this particular office for her in-
ternship because of her interest in

Rushdie book may have inspired attacks

' New York (AP) —- A New York
newspaper office and two Califor-
nia bookstores were firebombed
early yesterday in attacks possibly
related to Moslem anger over the
novel The Satanic Verses, officials

said.

”I can't imagine any other rea-

son why people would be lob-

bing bombs [at] bookstores,” said
bookstore owner Andy Ross as he
helped clean up the damage at
his Cody's Books in Berkeley,
Calif.

Both Cody's, a Berkeley land-
mark near the University of
California campus, and a branch
of the Waldenbooks chain a
block away were damaged when
bottles filled with a flammable li-
quid were tossed through win-
dows, their owners said.

The blaze at the Riverda/e
Press in the Bronx section of New
York City heavily damaged the
building, authorities said. No one
was inside at the time.

Witnesses said a station wagon
drove by the offices about 4:40
a.m. and someone in the car
tossed an incendiary device

through a window, police said.
The firebombing may have been
in retaliation for an editorial the
weekly paper ran last week sup-
porting the right to read Salman
Rushdie’s novel, said firefighter
Tom McTigue.

The novel has sparked violent
protests among Moslems who
consider it blasphemous. Iran's
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini or-
dered a death sentence for Rush-
die and his publisher.

”My guess is that it had some-
thing to do with something that
was printed in the paper,” River-
dale Press co-publisher Richard
Stein said. ”But I don't know
what."

Armenians given aid
by European nations

BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -
The European Economic Com-
munity and its member states
have given $37.8 million for vic-

tims ot the earthquake in
Armenia.

The community gave $11.4
million in emergency aid, and all
12 member states, except Italy,
donated additional aid totaling
$26.4 million, the EEC said.

It had no figure for Italian aid
of four flights with emergency
equipment, medicines and 30
medical staffers.

Total foreign assistance for vic-
tims of the Dec. 7, 1988 earth-
quake was $65.7 million, the
commission said.

The community and its mem-
bers sent thousands of tents,
blankets, heating and power
equipment, beds, medical equip-
ment, medicines, clothes,
prefabricated buildings and vehi-
cles to Armenia by air and road.

Heart auxiliary aids
man for 73rd day

A New Jersey man became
Presbyterian—University Hospi-
tal's longest-living recipient of a
Novacor heart auxiliary when he
entered his 73rd day with the

device implanted in his chest.

Jack Fisher, 45, a corporate
bond salesman from Rumson,
N.J., entered the hospital Sept.
29,'1988, with an inoperable
heart malfunction and received
the Novacor Left Ventricular As-
sist Device Dec. 8.

His heart has recovered
enough strength‘ since then to
make him ‘a candidate for the
transplant he needs, his doctors
say.

The previous hospital record of
72 days fell last week. Tuesday
was Fisher's 73rd day with the
device.

Judge excuses juror
from duty on trial

(AP) — An Erie County judge
Tuesday excused one of the three
jurors seated a day earlier to hear
the trial of an Erie County book-
store owner charged with kidnap-
ping and killing a banker's wife
last summer.

.Abortion

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, March I, T989

Continued from page 1
came in 1973, the same year the
U.S. Supreme Court legalized
abortion in the Roe vs. Wade
case.

”I was sort of caught in a
crunch,” Litman said. ”The wom-
en's rights movement came
along, and my marriage ended
about the same time."

WHS is a non—profit organiza-
tion. Most of its income and most
of the services it provides are

' abortions or abortion-related. Ac-

cording to Litman, many times
the organization doesn't take in
enough money to meet the
payroll.

”Recently,” she said, ”we just
did a fundraiser because we were
hit hard by Operation Rescue
with need for extra security and
personnel. So we did our very
first fundraiser ever, and it was
very successful. People in the

-Qcommunity responded very well

by giving us money to fight Oper-

ation Rescue.

”There is no way that they can
say that they do ’sidewalk coun-
seling’ because they do not sit
down with that young woman,
find out what her situation in life
is, if she has taken any kind of

Qwedicine, whether she was.

raped,” Litman said.

”And there are different types
of rape,” she added.

There are ”back alley” rapes,
but there are also date rapes, in-
cestuous rapes and marital rapes.

”Marital rape is something I
don't think anybody in the anti-
choice community would be
willing to admit to,” Litman said.

I °”They don't even think if

you're I3 and raped by your
father that you have a right to an

abortion on the 18th. After-

gward, workshops designed to
‘ educate about abortion will be
i set up. .

When asked why the teach-
in is being held, Finke said, ”A
lot of students don't know the
facts about the Supreme Court
hearing which could overturn
Roe v. Wade, [the case which
made abortion legal]. Many
people don't know that it's not
just abortion which could be
made illegal. The legality of
some types of birth control is
also being threatened.”

Based on a favorable
response from students at a
Jan. 23 pro-choice rally Down-
town, Finke said she expects
a good turnout at the teach-in.
Over 100 students participat-
ed in the rally.

Despite the usual appear-
ance of anti-protesters at many
pro-choice events, Finke does
not foresee any problems at
the teach-in.

”The primary goal of the
pro—life people is to conduct
’rescues’ in front of abortion
clinics," Finke said. ”They
usually don't go to things like
this.”

The sponsors of the teach—in,
the Pitt College Democrats,
the Campus Women's Organi-
zation and the Pitt Women's
Law Association, will begin
Csigning students up for the

. D.C. rally and the teach-in

’’All they are concerned with is
saving the fetus.”

To the pro-lifers the fetus is a
baby, but to Mary Litman and her
co—workers at WHS, it is a fetus.

Litman said that the difference
in terminology is deliberate. Pro-
life advocates call a ”viable fe-
tus” a baby to sensationalize a
woman's decision to abort.

”Almost all of our abortions
here are done in the first trimester
of pregnancy,” she explained.

After. this point, she admitted,
"there is a viable fetus that you

would be able to identify as a

sposed of, but it's like any part of

The waste fetal tissue from
WHS is given to Magee Wom-
en's Hospital in Oakland. Litman
said she is unsure of what be-
comes of it once it leaves WHS
possession.

Litman said there have been
cases in other cities where waste
fetal tissue has been sold to com-
panies which perform scientific
research, but, she added, this has

”I feel thatl have lived my en-

"Christian people should be

”My feeling right now is that

"If we lose the rights to
reproductive freedom," she said,
”then we lose a lot of other rights

threatened. _‘

"The right to control your body
is the right to control your access

"Christians to me are supposed
to be loving and caring, but I

Struggling Lady Panthers earn spoiler role

By Ed Kuznik

Staff Writer

The Pitt women's basketball
team, reeling from a slump in the
second half of their season, will
be attempting to play the roll of
giant killers in the upcoming Big
East Tournament, to be held at
Seton Hall University beginning
tomorrow.

The Lady Panthers finished a
disappointing season this past
Saturday by bowing to a solid Se-
ton Hall team by a 74-73 score
in a contest played at Fitzgerald
Field House.

The visitors’ Debbie Hartnett
hit a three—pointer with just seven
seconds left to give Seton Hall the
victory.

According to Pitt head coach
Kirk Bruce, the season—ending
contest was a particularly gut-
wrenching loss, because the Lady
Panthers had Seton Hall reeling
in the first half. Pitt jumped out
to a 41-28 halftime lead and ap-
peared to be in good shape at that

9 point.

”During the first half, we
played pretty good defense,”
Bruce said. ”We held them to 28
points, and that's a major mile-
stone for us with a team like that.
They do have some pretty good
offensive weapons.

”We came in with a game plan
in which we didn't want them to
fast break on us. However, we

Othought that we could run on

 

Oi

 

them, and we did.”

Pitt could not hold on to that
13-point advantage, as Seton Hall
managed to snare the vast majori-
ty of rebounds in the second por-
tion of the game. The Pirates also
shot a very respectable 56 per-
cent from the field in that second
half.

”You can't run the break when
you don't rebound well,” Bruce
stated. ”We got [beaten] 43-25
on the boards, and a lot of that
happened in the second half.
Plus, we couldn't handle their
press."

Still, Pitt was able to hold on to
a tenuous lead and looked to be
in good shape when guard Sue
Falvey hit a basket in the waning
seconds to put Pitt up 73-71. At
that point, Bruce called timeout,

' gathered his troops around him,

and emphasized -that he did not
want a three—point attempt taken
by any means.

’ But a mix-up in» the Lady Pan-
ther defensemade it seem like
Bruce was talking to the walls at
the Field House.

”We had played a lot of zone
in the first half, so during the
timeout I sv. itched to a man—to-
man in orde. to prevent an open
shot,”_ Bruce ;tated. ”But we had
a mixup on defense and the girl
[Hartnett] eluded up having an
open jump iot from the top of
the key.

”I told th- girls that I was like

The_Lady Panthers obtained
their highest team total of the sea-
son last Sunday but couldn't sur-
pass Indiana University of
Pennsylvania. _

Pitt scored an impressive 183.6
but was outscored by lUP’s
186.05.

”Performancewise we had our
best meet yet,” head coach Deb-
bie Yohman said.

Along with their highest team
total, the Lady Panthers chalked
up some individual high season
scores and_ broke a few. Pitt
records as well.

Pitt's floor squad scored 46.85
points on the event, which broke
the former Pitt floor record.

”We performed to our maxi-

mum on floor,” Yohman said. ’’It
was wonderful.”

Sophomore Tina Taylor "broke
the highest individual Pitt floor
score (set by former Lady Panther
Lisa Shirk) with a 9.7. Taylor won
the floor exercise event.

’’I’m excited about breaking
the individual school record, but‘
the team did also, and that's what
counts,” Taylor said.

Senior Trish Aser used a 2-year- —

old floor routine and scored 9.45,
her highest floor score this sea-

son. Aser tied for second place on ' l

Pirate success generates greater fan attention.

By ‘Alan Robinson
AP Sports Writer

BRADENTON, Fla. —- When
they were baseball's losingest
team four years ago, the Pitts-
burgh Pirates didn’t have a fan
problem. They didn’thave man
fans. 1
~ Now, a resurgence in the
standings has the Pirates facing a
pleasant dilemma: how to keep
happy the hundreds of thousands

of fans who swelled Three Rivers‘

Stadium to record attendance lev-
els last season.

The Pirates, who held seminars
last year to help their players de-

AT&

APRESENTS

-games, at

velop a better working relation-
ship with the press, expanded the
sessions this spring to include fan
relations.

The players were advised how
to deal with fans before and after
team-sponsored
caravans and even at a shopping
mall or a restaurant. Each player
was given a 15-page handbook,
written by the team's public re-
lations staff, titled, ”Succeeding
with the Public and the Media.”

Every team wants to improve
attendance, said Pirates Vice
President Rick Cerrone, but more
fans at the ballpark means fewer
chances for Joe Fan to get an au-

tograph, shake a player's hand, or
to feel like he's more than just an
anonymous ticket-holder.

”The fans fell in love with this
team in 1987 and for good rea-
son," Cerrone said. ”The fans
perceived the players as good
guys who wanted to win, who
enjoyed playing in Pittsburgh 
and as players who cared about
the fans.”

After suffering severe atten-
dance problems during a well-
publicized drug scandal and a
span of three consecutive last-
place finishes from 1984-86, the
Pirates’ much-improved image
helped boost attendance to a

club—record 1,866,713 in 1988.

The Pirates also drew record
crowds this winter during their
two-week-long fan caravans
through eastern Ohio, northern
West Virginia and Pennsylvania.
Bobby Bonilla and several other
players signed an estimated
2,000.autographs for three-plus
hours one night at an Indiana,
Pa., shopping mall, forcing the
mall to stay open an extra 90
minutes. _

’’It was the perfect example of
why the fans likethis team. The
players said they weren't leaving
until every person in line had an
autograph,” Cerrone said.

The Pirates’ players were ad-
vised in the seminars that ”per-
ception is everything,” that
slighting a fan can create a last-

ing, negative impression, espe- .
cially if the fan writes a negative 1

letter to the editor or calls a-ra-
dio talk show.

The brochure cites the example
of a Pittsburgh Penguins player
who forgot to thank the fan who
found his expensive wristwatch at
a local restaurant. A newspaper
columnist wrote of the incident,
creating an unfavorable and last-
ing negative image of the player
for thousands of readers.

But we still did some positive
things. This game should give us
some momentum for the tourna-
ment. We had a 13-point lead on
them, they came back, and we
still had a chance to win the
game at the end.”

Lorri Johnson did her usual su-
perlative job in the game for the
Lady Panthers, pouring in 20
points and grabbing 11 rebounds.
Senior Denise Becher also helped
out considerably, scoring 16 in
her last home game. Tabatha
Long was the only other Pitt play-
er in double figures, with 10. ,

The loss dropped Pitt to 11-16
overall (3-13 in the Big East), and

into sole possession of last placwi

in the conference. They will play
the preliminary game in the tour-
nament, which matches the
eighth- and ninth—place teams,

tough season, what with some-
what high expectations for
Bruce's crew followed by an

early—season eight-game winning0

streak which wasin turn followed

8 by an abysmal Big East regular

season showing, Bruce still does
not plan on having his squad
make Friday classes.

”No eight or nine team has
ever won the tournament,” Bruce
said. ”However, strange things
happen in situations like this. A
team on the roll at the end really
can do it. And you can get on a
roll if you win that first-round
game. _

”So we're going into the

Georgetown game expecting to‘
’ win it. We're down from losing

to Seton Hall, and we didn't want
to have to play in this first game,

now. It's a whole new ballgame
now, and that's the way we're go-
ing to approach this thing.”

‘ NOTES: Pittwill leave at1 p.m.
today for Seton Hall. _

. Johnson finished an All-
American caliber season witha

for the season. Connie Hurt (9.4),

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, March l, T989

TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) — This
is the year Cory Snyder has
been waiting for — the year he
plays for the big money.

After the 1989 season, the
Indians’ right fielder becomes
eligible for salary arbitration.
Players must have three years
of service in the major leagues
to be eligible for arbitration,
and Snyder is only 57 days shy
of that plateau.

He hopes to put together
some big numbers in 1989
that would allow him to enter
arbitration in 1990 and sub-

stantially increase the
$185,000 he made in 1988.

”This is an exciting year for
me,” Snyder said of his im-
pending entry into the next
level of baseball's salary struc-
ture. ”It’s exciting to be able
to have a chance to go to ar-
bitration. But it would be easy
to put too much pressure on
myself because of it. I've just
got to try to_ be consistent and
let whatever happens
happen/’

Snyder said a young player
in the big leagues today must

Snyder playing for big money

learn to bite the bullet in his
first three years.

Snyder is still unsigned for
1989 but says he and the In-
dians are not far apart.

’’I’m not looking for a whole
bunch," he said. ’’I know I'm
not going to get what a [Mike]
Greenwell or [Mark] McGwire
got. They got great contracts,
but they earned them with
great years. I just want them to
be fair with me.”

Gymnasts

catch up to lUP. ”We finished up
the meet really strong,” she said.
”But once again, we met up with
a team who had their best meet
of the season.” A5

The Lady Panthers have to per-
form with few mistakes in their
upcoming. meets to secure their
chances of going to the NCAA
Eastern Regionals.

”We’re going to have to have
flawless meets,” Yohman said.
”We’re sitting right on the last-
place spot out of the teams going
to regionals.”

However, the gymnasts feel
confident, especially after their
perfomance last Sunday.

”l think we're heading in the
right direction,” Aser said. ”We'll
be there when it counts.”

”We‘re going to peak when we
want to,” added Sleith. ”Region—
als is where we want to peak.”

Pitt hosts North Carolina State
this Saturday, March 4, at 4 p.m.
in Trees Hall. '

According to Yohman, N.C.
State is consistently scoring in the
182—range.

”The players are often viewed
as extended members of the fam-
ily because they are in a fan's
home every day on TV and ra-
dio,” Cerrone said. ’’I remember
last year when one of our play-
ers was walking to his car after a
game. He was in a hurry to meet
his family, but there were two
kids waiting for his autograph so
he signed.

”Seven or eight more kids
came up and he signed for them.
Finally, he had to leave without
signing for everyone_and a guy
yelled at him, ’Hey, jerk, remem-
ber who pays your salary.’ You
try, but just can't please
everyone.”

”You wish you could spend
time with every fan, but [you] just
can’t,” pitcher Jim Gott said.
”Sometimes after a game you
can't sign for everybody, espe-
cially when your family is wait-
ing for you. So I make an effort
to talk to everyone. I don't want
people going away with bad
memories, with the impression
[that] I didn't give them the time
of day.” 7

”We really do want to serve
our fans, and I think our players
have an outstanding relationship
with the fans,” Cerrone said.

THE PlTl' NEWS, Wednesday,.March l, 1989

IRVING, Texas (AP) —— Jim-
my Johnson took control of the
Dallas Cowboys Tuesday, say-
ing success wouldn’t come as
easily in the NFL as it did
when he coached for Oklaho-
ma State and the University of
Miami.

’’I do believe that if commit-
ment, enthusiasm and hard
work [are] worth anything,
we'll make progress in Dal-
las,” Johnson said at an after-
noon press conference.

Johnson was named coach
of the Cowboys Saturday by
the team's new owner, Arkan-
sas oilman Jerry Jones, who
roomed with Johnson and
played football with him at Ar-
kansas in the 19605.

/ohnson sends Landry
packing with kind words

Johnson replaced Tom Lan-
dry, whose 29-year career
with the Cowboys included a
league-record 20 consecutive
winning seasons and two NFL
championships.

Landry's replacement stun-
ned Dallas fans, and Johnson
apologized for any hard feel-

ings created by the sudden 4

transition.

’’I think Tom Landry is one
of the finest individiuals and
finest coaches I would ever
hope to know,” Johnson said.
’’It hurts me when someone
says l did something out of dis-
respect to Tom Landry.”
