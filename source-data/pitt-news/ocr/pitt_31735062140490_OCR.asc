Commission

Courses For Engineers
New courses leading to commissions in the naval reserve for junior
and senior engineering students have been announced by the U. S. Navy

‘Department. Appointments will offer the student a chance to serve his
country and at the same time continue with an engineering career, an

announcement from staff headquar-

ters of the fourth naval district,
Philadelphia, indicates.

Naval officers will meet with
juniors and seniors in the Schools
of Engineering and Mines tomor-
row ‘at 11:30 o’clock in Foster Me-
morial, and at 1:30 o’clock in 124
Cathedral when they will conduct,
personal interviews.

, In a new course just announced,
seniors who apply will be commis-
sioned as e n s i g n s, volunteer
(special service), E-V (5), upon
graduation. They imay then be
ordered to active duty wherever
their services arerequired.

Juniors, immediately upon ap-
proval of their applications, will
be commissioned as ensigns in pro-
bationary status, E-V(P), and upon
graduation will be transferred to
the classification of ensign volun-
teer, (special service). Probation-
ary ensigns may request and be
ordered to temporary active duty
for training with-‘pay iliiring the
summer months.

Officers may be ordered to ac-

More Cars Are

Needed To

Flll  Quota

Second call for volunteers to the
student ambulance corps was is-
sued today. The response has not
been adequate to ﬁll the demand for
60 automobiles needed for protec-

tion against possible air raids, ac-
cording to Dr. H. C.‘ Carlson, di-

rector of Men’s Student Health

service.

_He also said that there is a great
need for volunteers in the latter
section of the corps to transport
the ‘injured on the Cathedral
grounds and within the building.’

Private cars are needed to trans-
port the wounded to hospitals. All
types of cars, sedans, coupes, con-
vertibles will be necessary.

Volunteers may apply by ﬁlling
out the registration form and leav-
ing, it at the University post office
167 Cathedral, or the Men's Stu-
dent health service.

The Cathedral distiict has been
divided into eight zones over which
the needed volunteers will be as-
signed. Three crews are needed for
each section, two within and one
outside. A’

Drills will be conducted to pre-
pare for all casualties. Greatest
possible casualties will come be-
tween 8 and 10 o’clock every
weekday.

Fill out the registration form on
page ﬁve, this issue and leave it
at the University post oﬁice or at
the_Men’s Student Health service
on the 34th ﬂoor.

Second Call

For Donors

Another call for blood donors has
been made by the Pittsburgh Chap-
ter of the American Red Cross in
its effort to build a. blood bank that
will meet all emergency needs.

Pitt students may register at the
Men's or Women's Student Health
services this week. Blood volun-
teers may also call Gr. 1680 if

they want an appointment over the

Christmas holidays. ~

“When soldiers spill blood, they
are injured,” remarked Dr. C.
Carlson, director of the Men’s Stu-
dent Health service. “We may,
though we are unhurt, save their
lives by giving our blood.

“The giving of blood involves no
pain,” said Dr. Carlson. “It is easier
than a _Wasse:rman.”

Here are some Pitt students’ re-
marks on the experience and the
free lunch given to compensate for

the loss of blood: “It didn’t hurt a.

bit.” “That lunch was worth an-
other contribution any time.”

“It’s easier to give it involun-
tarily than ’voluntarily.”

“Pit? men and women now have

an opportunity to make a contri-_

bution to the national cause be-
yond mere words,” said Dr.
Carlson, “and I feel that all Pitt
students who‘are qualiﬁed to give
blood, should unhesitatingly do so.
Here’s a chance for all of us here
at home to make an “all out ef-
fort" to help those in the service.”
V “That blood that you give today
may save some soldier’s life.”

Ceremony in Commons Room
Commemorates Bill of Rights

University commemoration of
the one hundred and ﬁftieth anni-
versary of the»Bill of Rights took
place on Monday noon before sev-
eral hundred students in the Coin-
mons room.

With Pitt Riﬂes as color guard,
the program was opened by the
band playing “America,” and was
highlighted by Provost Rufus H.

Fitzgerald, who spoke on the his- V

torical background of the document
and its present meaning.

“It is fitting that the University
of Pittsburgh should observe a cen-
tury and a half of the freedom we
have enjoyed,” said Mr. Fitzger-
ald, in tracing the origin of the
Bill of Rights from state declara-
tions of liberty, Magna Charta, the
Petition of Rights, the French Dec-
laration of the Rights of Man, and
other historic documents.

These declarations represented
attempts to limit the powers of ty-
rannic governments, whether by
kings, presidents, or legislators.
They were an emphatic rejection
of old theories‘ of government and
.were based on a conception of
personal rights, Fitzgerald con-
tinued.

that the state is meant to serve

, ists for the state, and the challenge

- Aid. Training 

By ALBERT MAVRINAC
and ROERT LANDSEADEL

The University’s civilian dd _-
fense council formed plans to
dayto determine the qualiﬁca-in
tions of each’ student and fac-i
ulty member in the University and/,
to instruct students in first aid and
home nursing, as part of Pitt's‘,
program of civilian defense.

Dr. Asher lsaacs, assistant pro-.
fessor of economics, chairman 
the special classroom committee,
has already prepared a plan, by
which the special defense abilitie
of students and faculty will be de-:
termined. _ ' : I.

More than 70 students were in-
terviewed by members of Dr.
Isaacs’ committee on Monday in 9.;
test sampling. ~

The abilities of each individual
will be determined through person-
al interviews with members of the
committee. The dean of men and
the dean of women are expected to
aid in the interviewing of students.‘

Through these interviews the
UDC will be able to determine the
defense positions each individual.
may ﬁll. _

Dr. Einar W. Jacobsen, deanof
the School .of Educati'or;,'_and co‘-
ordinator of UDC, revealed that 70
students in the School of Medicine,
under the direction of Paul L. Mc-
Lain, assistant professor" of physi-"P '
ology, had volunteered to give up.
their Christmas vacation in order
to assist in first aid work.

These 70 students will take in-
tensive courses in ﬁrst aid work
during the recess to qualifythem‘
to instruct students after 'JanuaIi'yl

 

Plans are now under way to -en-
roll students in first aid and home"
nursing COUFSCS as S00“ 3.5 p0S$i~
ble. ,

Dr. Jacobsen said that plans had
been completed by a special air-
raid warning committee, headediby

of military science and tactics,-to
provide for an eﬁicient air-raidi-
_ system throughout the
university. _
Details of the type of signal to
be given in classrooms and of the V
method of removing students from
classrooms to places of safety are
being worked out. - '

Axis Spares

gr Editor, the Pitt News: :-
I wrote you before, telling how
the war, oﬂicially declared last
‘l‘lM’onday,- was undermining the.
, health of some of the uiidergradu-
' ate exchange students. But my
i Writing must have been poorly con-
 structed or you didn’t have room
Vtfor the_letter.

' (Unfortunately, the Pitt News did
mzoyt receive this letter.)

4 I i It’s. not bad enough that I have
" Lithuanian relatives who have been
' exiled to Siberia (and we can’t even
a get money to them). No indeed.
The axis is yelling like vampires
for American blood—-the blood of
: my friends and relatives in Ameri-
ﬂca,(plus Europe).

A II guess I should be happy to
3 know that my immediate family is
‘safe in W. Va., but I can’t help,
it ‘feeling sorrow for my non Ameri-
can friends whose relatives are in
another country.

 ‘ For instance, Natalie Abuton.
 She isn’t the same nationality. Still
Ifeel remorse to think of what the
“pigs” (axis to you . -. .) are doing
to her family. Her parents are liv-
ing on Menden Isle; her brother is
.  Man/ila’s army. Would anyone’
ublame her for having insomnia ?

M n Then there is Edelmira Pino, my
Egood friend from Cuba. She’_s study-
' ing at Beaver Falls. I can well im-
I agine how she is taking this.

Intellectually, I know its wrong
~ to condemn a whole people because.
? of a few aggressors, but still, emo-
tionally, I despise the damn lot of
-them. (Note: I swear only when
..;speaking of these rates. They’re
not even men.)

wheels any way you ﬁgure it.

 Please excuse the king’s English,

 This interview with Dr. Solomon
43. Freehof, widely known religious
leader of Pittsburgh, is the first in
A C series of articles acquainting stu-
dents at Pitt with what prominent
religious leaders ‘think about them,
, about youth in general, and about
youth’: place in the world.

_ > Dr. Solomon B. Freehof, rabbi of
the Rodef Shalom temple, talked
of religion with a warm and con-
tagious spirit. _
 ' with a keen analysis of man's
. Jnaterialistic problems ‘based on a
srricll background of literature and
, history and ‘ a genuine love for
_ God, Rabbi Frcehof explained that
.youth and its) problems today are
a little different from those of the
‘ youth of yesteryear.
N “All theories of ours vanish ‘be-
‘ “fore the treachery at Pearl Har-
., bar. There is nothing to do but de-
- feud ourselves, and in this task
1 youth is no different from any
other generation and is in no great-
 cr danger than any other genera-
) tion,” the rabbi said. “Old women

smooth connotations.

We are preoccupied with a new,
dynamic world problem; and our
grades, our quality points, our
danccs, our style shows, our aft-
ernoon teas——all seem ridiculously
insigniﬁcant to us. Our little circles
are disrupted, and we are left-with
nothing but a. somewhat shaky op-
timism in what's going to happen
after.

But this must be wrong. If these
things seem trivial to us now, then
they were trivial to begin With. If/

writing beautiful, smooth phrases"

ever was of any value to us, then
that value should be strong enough
to withstand this new strain.
not, then connotations and fresh-
man English should have been.dis-
carded long ago. If solving prob-
lems in calculus satisﬁed us, made
us happy, then it should still make
us happy.

Anything that was ever of any
real importance to us, that ever
really mattered to us, should be
strong enough now to repulse the
n e w, nothing-matters-but-the-war
feeling. If not, thep we shouldn’t
be bewildered. We should cut all
classes, art exhibits, and lectures,

and start killing ‘Germans.
MIRIAM HOROWITZ, C44

Amazecl, Consternatecl,
Disappointed in News

Editor, the Pitt News:

I have read with interest, amaze-
ment, consternation and disap-
pointment the Pitt News account
of the Hawaiian incident.

A feeling of consternation came
over me as I read Mr. Beigel’s ac-
count of the Japanese attack. How
any thinking individual (Naxis ex-
cluded) could be brazen enough to
state that a force of about 70 ‘four-
motored bombing planes, dive-
bombers, and torpedo-carrying
planes took part in the attack, and
that these planes came from an air-
craft carrier, is beyond me!_

Finally, I am truly disappointed
in the Pitt News editorial staﬁ’ for
permitting such tripe to be print-
ed—-especially since the News has
already taken an impassioned stand
for the whole truth. An elementary
knowledge of naval aircraft and
aircraft carriers would disclose
that NO aircraft carrier in all the
world could accommodate even
ONE “four-motored bomber” on its
flight deck; andcertainly that even
if it could accommodate one such
bomber on its ﬂight deck, the plane
would be unable to take off in the
space available.

No, Mr. Beigel is, at best, a poor-
ly informed (or misinformed) news
analyst who had best content him-

Youth  

and hate and to keep us aware of
the time when all nations will live
together in a world of peace.”

Rabbi Freehof ventured that
‘.‘there may be a new integration of
ideals. In that case it will be, un-
predictable how we will turn. We
may go in either direction--toward
the creation of a better life or to-
ward a world in which religion will
go through one of its historic peri-
ods of martyrdom, a few keeping
the ﬂickering ﬂame going.

“The church has played the role
of transmitting the ideals of mutual
justice and brotherhood which
would have made war impossible.
But having failed in this respect,”
he said, “it must turn from preach-t
ing to psychology to get its mos-
sagc across.”

Comparing the religious attitude
of the generation of youth today
with their parents’ generation, Dr.
Freehof thought that “the atti-
tude today is a marked ‘improve-
ment in this respect. A generation
ago there was prejudice against re-
ligion. -

“To be scientiﬁc you had to be
materialistic.” It was thought that
science explained everything. “Now
with the growth of psychology we
know that life is full of mystery.

people is less conﬁdent and co‘'nse-' ;

self with settling the weighty eco-
nomic problems of our pation, and
leave the war news to more capable
hands. I regret that such a frontal
attack on an individual is neces-
sary, but, in the interest of the stu-
dents and faculty who read the Pitt
News, a demand for the truth must
be made of all who would attempt
to analyze the war news.

ry on the Oahu attack was compiled

-from nited Press dispatches pub-

in ational background on car-

issue of Life magazine.

The UP Honolulu correspondent
reported that four-motored bombers
were seen in the attack. Since I read-.
ily agree that aircraft weighing up
to say 40 tons require more than a
maximum 1000-foot carrier runway,
the heavy bombers mentioned were
most likely land-based, travelling
some 1500 miles during the night of

Debate Contest
Open to Students

A national debate contest open to
students’ who are enrolled in full-
time courses in liberal arts, was
announced by the American Eco-
nomic Foundation of New York
city. The question for debate is
“Does Youth Have a Fair Opportu-

nity Under Our American System
of Competitive Enterprises ? ”

The purpose of the contest is
to “encourage interest in and un-
derstanding of American economic
institutions.” First prize is $1,000,
second prize is $500, and there will
be sixteen prizes of $50 each.

Each participating college and
university will, by competitive se-
lection, choose as its’) representative
an undergraduate student, man or
woman,‘ who is pursuing a full-time
course In liberal arts leading to a
bacheloris degree. Each student
will then ﬁle a 500-word brief with
a panel of Judges who will select
the eight best aﬂirmative and the
eight best negative briefs and
award the $50 prizes accordingly.

Four radio debates over local
stations of the Blue Network will
reduce the number to four affirma-
tive and four negative speakers,
who will then submit briefs to a
fresh panel of judges. These will
select the ﬁnalists-—two affirmative
and two negative——for the general
broadcast over the Blue Network
of the National Broadcasting com-
pany on May 10. -

an interview with

Dr.

Solomon B. Freehol

Youth no longer worships capi-
talists and to a large extent it is
also emerging from its first wild
enthusiasm for communism. lt is
not orthodox with regard to any

economic system. All it wants is E

a decent chance for happiness, Dr.
Frcchof pointed out.

“That is the point of view of en-
lightened religion. It is not capi-
talistic and not communistic. It be-
lieves in the sacredness of the in-
dividual and will attack any sys-
tem which denies it,” the Rabbi con-
tinued. .

Dr. Frechof believes that young
people, like all people, need re-
ligion as ,“an instrument for con-
vex-ling our occasional illumina-
tions into a steady guiding light.”
Because of the more realistic at-

titude of the young generation, Dr.

Freehof declared that youth “will

go around from church to church

looking for religion. They will shop

around without formally abandon-

ing their present aﬂiliations. As a

result, religious doctrine will tend‘
to reality, and the message from

the pulpit will be a more realistic

one.” \

In conclusion, Dr. Frechof sum-
med up the position of religion
with respect to its future message
to the youth of the world. "Reli-
gion,” concluded‘ the rabbi, .“must

The cartoon which appeared in
the last Friday News had every-
body wondcring whether the girl
was supposed to be Kitty Lou, or
Dotty Stack. (either way it at-
tracted plenty of attention.) Did
you know that Katherine Hep-
burn’s mother's name is Kit
Haughton? No relation we under-
stand, but there’: nothing the mat-
ter with her either.

Since everyone else in the na-
tion has taken the liberty to pick;
an all-American team this Fall, we‘-
have followed suit, and have chos-
en an “all-Pittpourri,” guaranteed
to defeat any eleven in the nation.
This is it: QB, Nancy Sundstrom,
who outgenerals the opposition.
LH, Peggy Fixel, whose broken
ﬁeld ability is unmatched. RH,
Eleanor “Modern Design” Epping,
who gets away faster than Bruce
Smith. FB, Barbara Kohberger for
steady “line” bucking. ,

In the line we have: LE, Mary
Zarman, a -great terminal in the
straight away. ’LT, Peggy Johns,
the mighty mite. l.G, Evey Smith,

(who plays like Wildung when the
chips are down. C, Dotty Stack,
who is in the middle of everything,
and can back up her line.

At RG we have “Special Deliv-

ery” Coffman, who plays a great

game despite injuries. RT, Betty
Ann Crede, who plays in the en-
emy backﬁeld. RE, Jana Friday,
who is an expert at “pass” defense.
The “Tuck Shop Debutantes” are
not scheduled to play in anybowl,
but it might not be a bad idea.

We're not exactly splitting our
sides over the war declarations

It’s been said before, and it still
holds good-—that there can be too
much emphasis on this no-time-for-

minutes.

stand and says whut ya think yur

they ran away. It wuz very discur-
igin fer awhile cuz I couldn’t ﬁnd
anybody else doin anythin I could

Of all our prosaic routines that
are being affected by the present
emergency, one of the most dis-
turbing is the make-up job that is
so vital a part of every woman’s
schedule.

University coeds, however, (ﬂex-
ible little creatures that they are)
have taken it all in their stride, and
refuse to let such an insigniﬁcant
motive as catching a man, a job,
or a ride home, interfere with their
patriotic self-sacriﬁce.

One pretty young thing asked to
borrow a bit of powder from an-
other last Monday.

,“Powder!” the latter exclaimed
indignantly. “How can you think of
a think like powder at a time like
this!” ’

And she carefully went on curl-
ing her eyelashes.

We now take you to a table in a.
local coffee-shop where three little
old ladies are chattering over their
dessert. ‘

One was telling of her recent;

meeting with a young doctor.

“He said he didn’t remember
me, and I said well you tried aw-
fully hard to find something wrong
with me a few months ago and he
said'you know that’: funny I never
forget a good-looking girl but I
sure slipped up this time.”

That fellow’s fortune is made.

LATEST RELEASES:

Tommy Dorsey’s pre—Christmas
present to Dorsey fans is a smooth
well-balanced platter consisting of
a grand ballad entitled “It Isn’t a
Dream Any More.” Mellow Jo
Stafford is featured on the lyrics
which are OK. Very smooth for

dancing. Plattermate is the new

“Oh, Look At Me Now,” entitled
“How Do You Do Without Me?”
It really rocks with Frank Sinatra
doing his usual solid job on the
vocals. Sharp stuif. . . .

Bob Chester, who probably will
be in the vicinity of the Bill Penn
on January 16th, waxes two discs
this week. The first is “The Clock
Is Fast,” a smooth ballad, and
“Harlem Confusion,” a jazzy
bounce tune. . . . Other disc fea-
tures two tunes from Eddie Can-
tor’s new show “Banjo Eyes,”
namely “A Nickel to My Name”
and “Not a Care in the World.”
As you know, Chester became
famous on the hot “Octave Jump.”

The most beautiful record of the
releases is Glenn Miller’s arrange-
ment of Beethoven’s “Moonlight
Sonata.” Not for dancing, listeners
will enjoy it. Subtly speaking,
Beethoven is about to become fa-
mous just as Tschaikowsky was
made famous by Freddie Martin.
Discmate is Glenn’s theme song
during the ASCAP crisis, “Slum-
ber Song.” Too, too lovely. . . .

The Count is back. Basie blows
in with “Platterbrains,” an origi-
nal by the Count and Tab Smith,
saxist. Plenty of punch by the
brass and reeds. Flipover is “I

imfniout a sonnet an issue when he
wrote for the Pitt News, and the
other who piloted the plane from
which tickets to the Junior prom
last year were dropped, are now
writing for army publications.
Milton Lehman, former sonnet-

on.a_ variety of subjects. ‘ ‘

..,. He was a member of the ﬁrst
» class Edwin‘P_eterson instructed on
' th‘e.writing of theshort story. and
G‘ Mr. Peterson claims that Lehman

 proves that he is really interested

Lehman has been transferred to

willzvundoubtedly continue to write.

worst.” — .

V  the end of the year and entered

After the election of Camacho and
the discovery of the ﬁfth colum- ,
nists in Mexico, there was a sharp
change in public opinion. Last sum-
mer the majority of Mexicans con-
sidered the United States as a
friend and ally of their country.”

American products, such as mo-
tion pictures and juke boxes are
quite popular in Mexico, he ex-
plained. The people’s favorite
movie star is Mickey Rooney, in
spite of the ‘fact that the Mexican
movie industry has produced some
very ﬁne pictures lately.

T

Besides the movies, Mexicans
ﬁnd entertainment listening to
their superb symphony orchestra
led by Chavez, Dr. Bickley found,
or in attending grand opera per-

 formances given regularly.

 The bullﬁghts are still the bril-

‘lifant; colorful spectacles they have

always been and are even more
popular. - _

revealed, “most of the good seats

“In every-bullﬁght that I saw,”

he continued, “at least one" man

was injured.”

-The political situation in this
neighboring country is still rather
dangerous. Dr. Bickley saw Presi-

 een Vital

By ABE BLUESTONE

Although most students don’t
know it, the University has a course
which is as vital to defense as any
of those offered by the government
training program.

It is meteorology, the study, not
of the stars, as some may think,
nor of the weather, as others may
imagine, but of the primary causes
of weather and climate through a
knowledge of the physics of the
air.

All air corps work is dependent
on the Weather. No take—ofl"s can
be made in bad weather. No bombs’
can be dropped when the target is
covered by fog. No planes can be
Atlantic when
storm fronts are growing.

This information cannot be giv-
en 10 minutes before ﬂights are
scheduled; it must be prepared far
in advance.

Coast artillery fire, covering
ranges of 15 miles and over, is
sensitive to temperature, air pres-
sure, winds, altitude changes. Fir-
ing tables must allow‘ for these fac-
tors and only trained men can
make them.

River boats, now handling the
heaviest traﬂic in history, coastal
shipping, and convoys, all depend-
ent on long range weather predic-
tions ~ for their schedules and
routes.

Road-builders, dam" construction
contractors, and’ ﬂood-prevention
programs——to them climatic condi-

tions are vital. When skyscrapers '

are built, wind velocities must be

‘ considered.

All these defense and civilian ac-
tivities must consider the weather,
and allowe a great debt to the
man who keeps them going, the
meteorologist. _

At present the University has
only one course, a general review
of the subject, but next semester
it will offer a comprehensive study
of the fundamentals of meteor-
ology. _

The course will include the study
of gas, temperature, humidity,
wind, and condensation laws, adi-
abatic processes, air mass analysis,
and practice in mapping and tak-

to Defense"

ing data. ‘

At present the department has
the following instruments in use;
minimum - maximum thermome-
ters, rain ‘gauges, micro-baro-
graphs, hydrothermograph, psy-
crometer, and an electro-magnetic
microbarograph, which records
minute pressure changes within
seconds. ,

Donald Bradford, seismology and
meteorology director, -predicts a
growing demand for ‘men trained
in this field. Already there is _a.
shortage in the Department of
Commerce of junior meteorologists.
The army and navy are taking
men as fast as they can get them.

This demand will not end with
the war, according to Bradford,
with’ airlines growing, with trans-
ocean ﬂying growing more import-

,ant, with farmers more and more

“dependent; on weather reports for
crop planting. * _ ‘

SFA Book Drive‘
To End Friday-

Student - Faculty , association’s
book drive for men in camps will
end at 4:30 o’clock Friday after
five weeks 'during which over,1,000,
books were donated‘ by students
and faculty of the University.

The Pitt drive, first of its kind
ever conducted in any college or
university, will be followed “in the
near future” by a national book‘
drive sponsored by the American
Library association. .

According to ALA,‘ “Millions of
books will be provided for men in
the armed forces of the .United
States and the Merchant Marine
through a National Defense Book
campaign, with the American Red
Cross and the United Service or-
ganizations cooperating.”

Similar to the attempt of the
SFA campaign, these books will be
distributed to army camps, naval
bases, USO clubs and other service
centers. It is the ﬁrst national cam-
paign to collect reading matter for
the armed services. I

Objec

By JOHN DARICHAK

What does the average professor
think of while he is lecturing?
Does he consider his students a
mass of numbskulls who must be
exposed to various math theories
or physics laws, or does he try to
teach, them for tl'lel1‘s.0Wl'l future
good?

' Probably the people best equip-
ped to answer these questions are
the teachers who teach the teach-
ers———the faculty of the School of
Education.

Dr. William Yeager, professor of
education and‘ director of courses
in elementary education, believes
that it is the duty of teachers to
round out each student as an indi-
vidual. ”

His conception of an average
student is “a many-sided individ-

ual who -must be developed‘ in all

his many phases; mental,>ph_ysical,
spiritual, moral, emotional, and so-
cial.” He compared many students
to a wheel which, with one ﬂat
part in its circumference, may
have its entire efficiency hampered.
These students have one or more
personality weaknesses which ham-
per the efficiency and well-being
of the complete person.’

According to Dr. Yeager, teach-
ing on a college‘ level i_s an individ-
ual. matter.‘ When the teacher rec-
ognizes a weakness in a student,
he should first convince the student
of the need for overcoming his de-
feet.

The student must then analyse
himself to find what is responsible
for his personality defelzt. A cure
is usually effected with the help of
an outside adviser. ‘

“An unfortunate aspect _of our
present educational system,” con-
cluded Dr. Yeager, “is that while

tive of Methods Courses

juniors and seniors are usually giv-
en individual attention, for the
most part freshmen are allowed to
live or die, scholastically speaking,
by themselves.”

H. H. Green, instructor in com-
mercial education and acting head
of that department, believes that
the School of Education is trying
to teach "the student rather than
teach the subject. For the most
part students are taught only those
subjects which they know or can
be taught to realize are of value
to them.

Mr. Green also believes that the
teacher who helps his students to
a mastery of the course by hard
work is more app1'eciated'than an
easy-going instructor who makes
his course a pleasure with lighter
work.

Dr. John A.’ Nietz, professor of
education, offered his comments on
-teaching of graduate students.
Graduate students, he ﬁnds, prefer
method courses to subject matter
courses. In the methods of teach-
ing courses he tries to make as.-
sigmnents relating to the work of
the students, most of whom are
practice teaching.

More teachers study for advanc-
ed degrees than any other profes-
sional graduates. This is partly due
to the law which requires teach-
ers to take a certain amount of
graduate work and makes it even
more advantageous for them to
have advanced degrees.

However, another reason is that
teachers are not as completely edu-
cated in their profession as are doc-
tors, lawyers, .and others. Dogtors,

‘though, and to a ce1't-aine“>':tent
lawyers, engineers, and other pro-
fessional workers attend clinics
and conferences where they unoﬂi-
cially take advanced work.

_ One of the first heroes of the war
is First Lieutenant Boyd D. Wag-
ner,.for1ner Pitt student, who is
credited with shooting down two
Japanese planes and destroying 12

- planes on the ground at Apari in

the Philippines.

He has been cited by the army
‘for “distinguishing himself by his
daring attack on a Japanese aid
detachment.”_ '

Lieutenant Wagneir was chal-

_lenged by a dozen enemy planes as

he attempted to prevent the land-
ing of Japanese troops on the
northern tip of Luzon. He shot
down two planes, and then, head-
ing forejthe enemy landing ﬁeld,
dipped to the tree-tops and ma-
chine-gunned the grounded planes.
A Johnstown resident, Wagner
attended the University. vcenter
there for two years, coming to Pitt
in 1936. He -enrolled in the aero-
nautical engineering course, and in
1937 joined the ﬂying cadets.

Observing an unwritten rule that
all-American‘ selectees must be-

come active participants on the

post-season banquet ‘circuit, Edgar
Jones has been following it to the
letter this last month.

Edgar’s Welsh friends started
him off on the right foot, a few
weeks ago, when they tendered
him one of the greatest affairs ever
given for an individual player.
Former Pitt all-American Tom Da-
vies, now head football» coach at
Western Reserve, was the master
of ceremonies. Scranton’s. own
mayor was among the dignitaries
present.

The Pittsburgh Athletic associa-
tion held an aﬁair for numerous
sports luminaries and again Edgar
was on the list of honored ‘guests.
Among those who helped make ita
great success were his present
coach, Charley Bowser, and his for-
mer coach, Dr. Jock Sutherland.

This week, Edgar Jones was one
of the speakers at the City high
school most valuable man banquet;
numerous other high school affairs
are yet to be attended. By the time
he has completed his schedule, it
is taken for granted that Special
Delivery will be a very experienced
young man in the art of making
the banquet rounds.

Pitt Swimmers

Hope To Attend
Florida Meeting

Last year ﬁve members of the
Pitt swimming team attended the
annual meeting of the Aquatic For-
um at Fort Lauderdale, Florida.
Those who made the trip, in addi-
tion to coach Ben Grady, were
Ralph Wilde, Vety Shulness, Bill
McCaﬂ"erty, and Bill Reese.

A feature of the forum was a
swimming meet between a team
from the eastern schools and a
team representing the western uni-
versities. The ﬁnish saw the west-
erners far ahead of their eastern
rivals by a» score of 130-54. Grady
was one of the coaches inlcharge
< of the eastern team; Ralph Wilde
was the Panther representative on
this team.

It is hoped that a trip to Florida

waters will again be made by this»-

year’s members of the swimming
team. The boys will be able to pick
up some valuable pointers from the
talks on swimming and diving

f techniques'given by the coaches of

the various universities present.
The water carnival is another
feature of the long meet, and since

every boy that makes the trip down"

isagiven a part in the production,
it is eagerly being looked forward

to by those members of the team a,

who are planning to go.
In that, the Panther narrators
are scheduled to swim against the

' . Kenyon team on February 2, com-

peting in I the Florida meets will
give the boys and Coach Grady a
chance to ﬁnd their-ﬂaws and make
the . necessary adjustments before
that time. Kenyon is reported to
have noindividual stars but boasts
a strong, well baalnced team.
Both coach Grady and his varsity
swimmers feel that they are in for
a prosperous season andswill try
to get over this Kenyon obstacle
with the idea of keeping the ball
rolling along the victory trail from
there on down. to‘ the ﬁnish line.

The intramural basketball spot-4

light hits the engineering league
this afternoon when the slide rule
boys open another season. This
afternoon’s proceedings will raise
the lid on a schedule which will be
immediately interrupted by the
Christmas recess. However, today’s
games should give some indications
as to what is to be expected.

Last _year’s runners-up, the AE
&:ME seniors, this season known

“' as the AE&ME “A” team, take on

the Civil E's in the curtain raiser.
The AE&ME’s were upset in the
ﬁnal game last year by an under-
dog Electrical E quintet, 23-11.

The younger brothers of the seni-
ors, the AE&ME “B” team faces
the Industrial engineers in the sec-
ond and concluding battle of the
day. -The real battle of the loop

,. will probably take place when the
two AE&ME teams meet later in

V the season. _

Tomorrow evening the frater-
nities continue to move through

» their schedule when Theta ‘Chi

meets the Phi Eps, and the Phi

‘ Both the Phi Eps and Theta Chi
quintets have already been beaten

stay in the running for the league
title. More than one loss "is us-
ually enough to knock a team out
of the championship picture.

The Phi Eps lost to ‘one of the
stronger teams of the circuit, the
PiKAs, 37-28, while the Phi Gams
are responsible for Theta Chi’s loss.
Led by Jimmy Deutelbaum, Jay
Silver-berg and Alex Zelenski, the
Phi Eps should come out on top.

Winding up intramural basket-
ball for 1941, the Phi Delts and
PiKAs will play in the feature
game of the evening. The Phi Delts
tied for third place last year, while
this year's PiKA squad is pretty
tough. With the exception of Dick
Fair, the PiKA team is made up
mostly of freshmen, but have come
through unscathed thus far in two
engagements. On the basis of this,
the PiKAs are the favorites in this

' game.

By SHEME BAZELL »

That the football season just-
ended was .not one ﬁlled with suc-
cessive and consistent victories for

, the Pitt squad is evident by the
"J unimpressiveness of the statistics

 and Ralph with eight point after"

    
   
      

recently “compiled by patient ath-
letic publicity director Frank Car-
ver. , . 
A true barometer of a team's
potential strength is almost always
reflected in the yardage gained by
rushing, I or on so-called power
plays. The Panther quarterbacks
called for the line-rush,439 times
netting a season's total of 1303
yards. While our collective oppo-
- nents, in only 411‘ attempts,'man-
aged to record 1577 yards.
Pitt’s most potent power attack

was enjoyed against Ohio State,-
‘\ when the Blue and Golders aver-
aged 4 yards per try. Though the

average was lower than in the
Buckeye fracas, Carnegie Tech pro-
vided the Panthers with the sea-
son's top ground gaining mark of
293 yards.
Pitt suffered its biggest power
bite of the "season at Minnesota,
where the Gophers, grabbing 6
yard chunks each play, totaled 263
yards in 42 attempts; That high
Ewater mark was topped in quan-
" t.-";y by Michigan, gaining 260 yards
in 55 pushes. .

In the aerial division, Pitt gam-
bled 72 times, completing 18
passes for a yardage gain of 267,
and losing only eight on intercep-
tions. But the eight team opponent
record book shows 45 completions
in 113 attempts, measuring off 533

9 yards. »

Jrakinge the skyscraper entry in-
dividually, J onesand Fife were the

team’s scoring leaders: Edgar with 

six touchdowns and a conversion,

touchdown successes in ten trials.

Longest scoring runs of the year-

were turned in by four fellows
named Jones. At._Nebraska, Edgar
old boy nabbed an enemy aerial and
dashed 75 yards for the game win-
ning touchdown, seconds before the
ﬁnal gun. - ,
Another. interception and a forty-
lﬁve yard run by the Panther half-
back, earned a six pointer in the
Bubkeye contest. A week before the
season’s ﬁnale, against Penn State,
Jones weaved and swivel-hipped 43
yards, for the longest scoring dash
of the day. Against Carnegie Tech

A What F ans Already Know

seven days later, “Special Deliv-
ery” repeated that performance,
dashing 45 yards ’round end,~as his
ﬁnal touchdown contribution to col- I
legiate football records. ‘
Other highlights of the season
' proved to be the consistently good
performances of Bill Dutton, the
‘line plunging of Frank Saksa, and
the stubborn defensive work of
both Ralph Fife and Stan Geryelis.
Dutton hit- the opposing line’ 118
times, gaining 391 yards. He was
on the receiving end of three
passes and intercepted two others.
One game of the 1941 season will
be remembered above all others in
future reminiscing sessions. In
spite of how unimpressive the rec-
ord of three victories and six losses”
may seem, the «victory over Ford-
ham nulliﬁes all regrets.

Panther (Track

Squad Continues
Practice Drills

A busy hum ‘radiates from the
track and ﬁeld house and will con-
tinue to do so until the Panthers’
indoor cinder squad tackle their
first foe as the Olsonmen put their
training in high gear and initiate
their drills in individual events.

Last Monday evening climaxed
three weeks of preliminary work-
outs in getting into top physical

-shape in order for the Jungle Cats

to set out to meet a suicide sched-
ule that lists the top indoor teams
of the country.

The nemesis that confronts the
Blue and Cold as well as other col-
lege aggregations is the proposed
draft bill that is just getting start-
ed through the congressional mill.
If and when this piece of legisla-
tion passes, which is inevitable, it
will play a major role in weaken-
ing the prospects of a successful
campaign in the track world for
the local cinder ts-otters.

Many of the mainstays of Coach
Olson's team are ‘of the draft age
and may be nabbed by the long
grasping arm of Uncle Sam. Lumi-
naries like “Hap” Stickel, “Bullet
Bill” Carter,-Joe Wilt," Georg? Nik-
os, to mention only a few, will be
shouldering riﬂes instead of carry-
ing the Pitt banner into battle.

Dearest Santa,

As a college sportswriter, I

would like to represent the collegi- ’

ate sports world in this letter to
you. I have made axlist of men
whom I believe were pretty patient
and courageous during 1941, and
they certainly deserve anything
that you can possibly give them. In
order not to surprise these worthy
men I have not taken the trouble
to ask them what they want, for

I'm ‘sure what I ask of you will»

be more than acceptable to them.
So, here goes:

CHARLEY BOWSER-—A couple
of submarines, anti-aircraft guns,
machine guns, and dive bombers
ready tomeet the combined forces
from Minnesota, Duke, etc.

JIMMY IIAGAN-—Give him the

proper formula to make football .l

schedules. This year’s schedule was
Mr. Football Fan’s dream, but a
nightmare for our Panthers.

EDDIE BAKER——Should I tell
you‘! - 

MAX HANNUM——About a per-
fect record-—but, not the kind you
gave him last year. ‘

RALPH MITTERLING—A, cou-
ple of boys who could powder that

ball‘ a la,Di Mag. Also a few hurl-
ers a la—Well, you know.

P‘
s.

_-.-xgxuxu-xax-g_nn-x.—-gas: .-
- unnu-

"DOC” CARLSON-—He’s got it,
but Uncle Sammy is after it, too.

“BUFF” DONELLI—Can you
ﬁnd his “lost” bowl?

CARL OLSON—You don't have
another Woodruff? Well, another
Stickel or Carter will do. I

BERNIE BIERMAN——Say, how
did he get on my list?

BEN GRADY—.-—Ca1l for Johnny
Weismuller. . . . Call for Buster
Crabbe!

JAMES POTTS-—Here’s a guy
who really worked hard all year.
Let his new job be a little easier.

FRANK LEAI-IY—-Another wise
guy, eh?

CLARK SHAUGHNESSY—An-

 

other formation. A couple of teams
got wise to the “T.” Maybe a “V”
will do.

. , mooperativeness,

. for college ‘sports, I. remain a ﬁrm, ‘

  
 
 
   
  
  
 
 
   
    
  
  
  
   
 
 
  
  
  
  
   
    
   
  
   
   
   
 
 
 
 
  
   
  
  
   
 
  
 
  
  
     
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
 
  
 
 

RALPH FIFE—Give him--oh,I
almost 2forgot—he’s got what he
wants already. I

ALDO ICARDI -- A few more’:
cheers--on the solid side, too.

ROBERT ARTHUR -.-— Another. I
ﬁne band, of course.

“CHICK” DAVIES —- I really. ,.-
think this is one year that Chick,-,
will need your help, Santa. _ if/. V.

PAUL BROWN—-Who said   ~
high school strategy wouldn’t click ' _
in the college ranks? Just send him‘
a few boys from Massillon.

WALLACE WADE—Now, now, -
Wally, this is only for- the needy
men.  V

ALL SPORTSWRITERS- IN.‘
GENERAL-—Ah, Santa, we do’ not’-:»

,want anything for ourselves . .. ,_
but we do ask you to come to the ’
aid of the entire Sports World in ,
these times of world turmoil. Just _
as all men must answer the nation’s I‘
call, -so do the football, basketball, ;
baseball, and other sports playersgr .
But, come what must, please let  .
sports go on and on . . . during war‘ ji,’
or peace . . . without interruption. 
After all, if morale is one-half of:

. the battle to be won, there is prob?"
ab y nothing more vital than 
continuance of our national-sports
-—-for it is sports which aid in,

competitiveness,-

body and mind-building. Yes, .

Sports is the American youth.. . 

Believing that you’ll go “all out" .

faithful friend of yours, . _
