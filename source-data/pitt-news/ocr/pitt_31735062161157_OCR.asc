UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

Students can challenge
tenured professors on
.._ grading procedures

By Brendan Kevenides
Staff Writer

There is a prayer for students
who feel that professors have
been granted God—like power
over their academic careers.

If a student is in dispute with a
professor, there is an unwritten
procedure that should be
followed to alleviate the situation,
said United Faculty Union
President Philip Wion.

“Usually the ﬁrst step is to go
to the professor” and try to discuss
the ‘problem, he said. If this
discussion does not result in a
‘solution, the student may register
a complaint with the head of the
appropriate department.

Wion stressed, however, that
in order for the chairman to take
any action, there “has to be
reasonable grounds and evidence
that improper conduct is going
on.”

A lot of the disagreements that
arise between students and
teachers deal with test evaluation

A practices, according to Associate

Dean Dr. Wilbur E. Deskins, who
works closely with the Faculty of
Arts and Sciences’ Academic
Integrity ‘Committee. He
explained that a professor must
outline the way he will evaluate
a student’s performance at the
beginning of the course.
“Whatever plan a professor
has for grading must last
throughout the course. If the
professor changes the way he
originally said he would do
things, then the student has a
legitimate complaint,” he said.

Deskins said that it is not true -

that professors must grade

" students on a curve; this is not a

legitimate complaint. He added,
however, that a department chair
may easily correct a problem such
as a professor consistently being
late for class, especially if many

students complain.

Most problems are dissolved at
the department level, but if this
proves unsuccessful Deskins will
review the situation himself. He
said that he will first try to settle
things informally, then investigate
the incident‘ more closely and
present the facts to the Academic
Integrity Committee. The
committee, which is made‘ up of
undergraduates and faculty
members, will interview all parties
involved, go over Deskins’
findings and grant a hearing.

He said that his office usually
does not receive a lot of
complaints. Deskins said that this
term he has received six or eight
complaints about faculty
members and an equal amount
about students from professors.
He added that hearings on

students’ complaints are evenless '

common.

What is the most a department
head or the committee would do
to solve a problem?

“Ultimately, if abuse continues,
even a tenured professor could
be removed from the university,”
Wion said. “But this is rare and
would have to be an extreme
case.”

Deskins said, however, “When
a faculty member has tenure it is

PPC petitioned to fund rap group's appearance

By Chantal Evans
Staff Writer

Student supporters of WPTS’s
_rap show encouraged passers—
by in the Towers’ Lobby last
Friday to sign a petition asking
the PPC to help fund the visit of
a major rap group to Pitt.

Jonathan Robinson, specialty
music director at WPTS, said that
he sent an application to the Pitt

_ Program Council requesting its
help in bringing the group to Pitt.
He said that although the idea
was approved, the Pitt Program
Council refused to fund it.
Robinson said that the PPC has
never given him a specific reason
for refusing to fund the show;
however, he feels that the PPC is
just “scared” of the violence that
sometimes accompanies rap
concerts. -
Torn Misuraca, student adviser

 

for the Pitt Program Council, said
that the PPC is not in the funding
business. He said that is the
Student Government’s position.
He also said that to his knowledge
the PPC only received a space
reservation form, and at no time
was it approached regarding a
co-sponsorship.

Melinda Holben, ‘PPC’s student
coordinator, said it is not in the
PPC’s power to fund programs
that are not eitherfully sponsored
or co-sponsored by the PPC. And,
she said, “it's the chairperson’s
prerogative as to whether or not
he wants to co—sponsor a rap
show.” A

Holben said that" Robinson's

group is trying to make it appear
A to Pitt students that the reason

why PPC won't sponsor this rap
show is because rap music is
primarily a black music genre.
However, she said, this is not

 

true. _ _

“We do make it a point to
support minority programs,” she
said. “Wehave in the past and we
will continue to do so.”

Hugh Harkowitz, entertainment
committee chairman, said that
when he brought the idea before
his PPC staff advisers, he was told

that the main problem with such '

a show would be security.

“It's likely that most of the
people who would attend a rap
show here would not be Pitt
students,” he said. ’

Harkowitz said that he isn’t
sure how unruly this nonistudent

crowd could become. And, he_

said, if such a show were held, it
would probably take place in the
William Pitt Union or in David
Lawrence Hall.

“I think it’s a cop-out,” Robinson
said. “As long as I’ve been here,
I’ve been told that the PPC

sponsors concerts. As a matter of
fact, someone at the PPC told me
that the funds are available.”

. Chris Kersey, the Monday
morning rap show D.j., said, “The

PPC doesn’t bring any groups

that black students want to see. If
they can put up $20,000 to bring
MTV, why can’t they bring a rap
group to Pitt?”

He also mentioned that IUP is
bringing Take 6 and Penn State is
supposedly bringing EU, a music
group from Washington, D.C.

Robinson feels the same way.
“If they can put out $20,000 for
MTV, why can’t they spend $5,000
or $10,000 for a rap group?”

He mentioned that three rap
events have been held here at Pitt
with large numbers in attendance
and no reported incidents of

 

violence.

“I hope that people see that

‘there is a ‘large minority on
said Robinson, '

campus,” _
“Bringing a rap group is for

everyone.Ipersonally don’tmindA ~ ' A

student funds put out for
something interesting to see. The
people who sign this petition are
doing so knowing that their funds
are going to this student activity.”

Robinson had a date secured
with Tuff Crew, but he had to
cancel because of insufficient
funding.

Robinson plans to send copies
of the petition to the Pitt Program
Council, members of the Student

Activities Office, the black studies V

department and The Pitt News.
He hopes to see a major rap
group perform at,Pitt by the next
term.‘

Group continues recycling efforts

By Sharon Romanovich
For The Pitt News

By now, many students have
probably seen the big blue and
gold containers located in the
Cathedral of Learning. These bins,
urging students to “Can Your
Cans,” have been put there to
promote recycling on campus.
These bins are provided thanks
to the work of students involved
in CLEAN.

CLEAN is an acronym for
Concerned Leaders for
Environmental Action Now, a
new, student—run environmental
group. Lou Fineberg, co-founder
of CLEAN, said, “The group
organized in August. Jay Katz
passed out leaﬂets for people
concerned about the environment
to get together and discuss some
of the problems facing the
environment.”

There were 10 people at their
first meeting, and “three really
took on ‘leadership,”’ according
to Fineberg and co-founder Traci
Darin. Fineberg, Darin and Kelli
Stevens got the group started.

“In the beginning, the main
incentive was to initiate recycling
on campus,” said Fineberg. With
the help of facilities management,
CLEAN got the bins put in the I
Cathedral. '

“To get the bins in the Cathedral,
we had to come up with a plan

on how to recycle — not just’ ’

cans, but paper and glass. We
then got in touch with facilities
management for the bins. An
outside ﬁrm, Alcoa, was hired.‘
We showed student interest, and 
facilities management was very
supportive.” "

There will be more bins
appearing all over campus. They
will be in the William Pitt Union,

Forbes Quad, Benedum Hall, the I

‘it  

l

  

 

Chemistry Building, Old
Engineering/LRDC complex, Salk
Hall, Clapp/Langley/Crawford
complex, Litchﬁeld Towers, and
Lothrop Hall.

Fineberg , said,
management had 12 bins ordered
before CLEAN ever went to them.
They were going to start their
own program, but they were so
impressed with CLEAN that they
decided to aid us."

Darin said, “This stems from
the Act 101 Law, a law created to
initiaterecycling in Pennsylvania.
We originally wanted to do
something to implement recycling
on campus; however, we are
more environmental and less
recycling. Recycling is only part
of what CLEAN is all about.”

Members of CLEAN recently
went to a national conference
held at the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill.

“It was amazing. There were

I 1,600 students from all over the
[United States]. They had

speakers, people who have been
involved with the environment,
to get us fired up,” said Fineberg.
“We learned a lot about what we
can do, and how to apply [what

“Facilities '

They told us it is up to us to do
something.”

Darin said, “Really, we are the
last generation who can do
anything and make a difference.”

CLEAN is also working with
concerned students from other
campuses in the city. “Carnegie
Mellon, Duquesne, Chatham,
Point Park and Carlow colleges
have all expressed a desire to be
involved,” said Darin.

One of CLEAN’s goals includes
saving rain forests, “not only
abroad, but rain forests in the
United States,” said Fineberg.
“There was a letter—writing
campaign to save the Tongass
Forest in Alaska.”

Other goals include saving the
dolphins and environmental
regulation. “Right now, we are
more concerned with short—term
goals, like the recycling,” said
Fineberg. “The bigger goals are
long—term, and each one takes a
lot of time.” .

CLEAN also wants to establish
a separating process. Separating
glass, cans and paper for recycling
is another of its short—term goals.

DARE to appear on
local television show

By Iarry Chough
For The Pitt News

Members of Pitt’s chapter
of Drug and Alcohol
Responsible Education will
be interviewed tonight about
alcohol use and abuse on
campus on KDKA’s Evening

Magazine.
Four members of DARE,
. senior Paul Kengor,

‘sophomores Christie Kieper
and President Julie Levine",
and freshman Karen Elliott
were chosen to participate in
the discussion because of the
age range of the speakers.

The interview will
speciﬁcally discuss problems
such as peer pressure,
fraternity-sponsored parties
vs. apartment parties, possible
reasons for ‘ greater alcohol
consumption on weekends
and the difference between
responsible drinking and
problem drinking.

DARE is a chapter of the
national organization
BACCHUS (Boost Alcohol
Consciousness Concerning

the Health of University
Students). DARE’s primary

goal is to educate students V

and promote
drinking.
However, Julie Levine
stressed that the group is not
anti—alcohol: “We’re not

responsible

' prohibitionists.” She added

that the group does not exist
to pass judgement on
students.

_DARE offers guidance to
those who may be faced with
decisions on substance
abuse, including those who
already have drug‘ and
alcohol problems. The
organization is not a
counseling service, however.
If a student approached
DARE with a‘ problem, the
organization would refer him
or her to an appropriate
advising center.

DARE spreads its message
through the use of thought-
provoking displays on
campus. Displays used in the
past ranged from a wrecked
car to to a coffin set up in the
Towers lobby.

A somber no-win situation  

Imagine raising yourbeautiful baby girl into a sweet
young lady, only to find out that she isn’t technically
yours. ,_

‘T hat is exactly how Robert Mays must feel. He and his

‘ late wife had taken their little bundle of joy home from the

hospital, only to find out 10 years later that a switch had
taken place in the hospital, and, the little girl they had

A - loved as their own was not realiy theirs.

It sounds like a corny plot from one of the daytime

’ dramas, and as a matter of fact, that very same story line

is a favorite of every respectable soap opera. However,

' ' this is_ real life. ‘ -

Ernest and Regina Twigg discovered that they were not
the biological parents of Arlena T wigg after she had been
diagnosedas having a genetic heart defect that neither of

the ;fEwiggs..:were.-carriers . of. After look.ing...into..,the

situation, they foundiout _that the only other white baby
born at that time at Hardee Memorial Hospital was
Kimberly Michelle Mays. —

. The T wiggs convinced Mays to permit Kimberly to

; undergo genetic testing with the promise that they would
' not seek custody, no matter what the outcome. The tests

proved, with 99.9 percent certainty, that Kimberly is the
biological daughter of the Twiggs. J
However, the agreement does permit the Twiggs to
seek visitation rights, which Mays is now considering
blocking on the grounds of the psychological damage it

A ' may cause the young girl; '

It is a sad situation for both families; however, the young
girl should remain with the only father she hasever
known. In addition, a-s hard as it may be for the Twiggs,

-they should not seek visitation rights. Their daughter is

dead. . ,
In cases such as this, biology should have nothing. to do

. with it. The Twiggs have had a rough time tryingto accept

the death of the little girl they raised, but it does no good

  to disrupt the life of another little girl in an attempt to
‘ - “bring their daughter back to life.” If Arlena had not died, .
 it is doubtful that even if the Twiggs‘ had discovered the
‘truth, they would be willing to hand over their healthy

» _ daughter to a couple of strangers -— biological parents or

not.

‘The carelessness of the hospital staff at Hardee has

V caused a no—win situation for the Twiggs, Mays and, most
I importantly, ‘Kimberly. The Twiggs are understandably

grieving for the loss of their daughter, but causing stress

and confusion in the life of a little girl is not the solution.

Editor's Note: In the ariticle
the following letter addresses,
Joel Garrett was incorrectly
identiﬁed as Joel Gray and the
incorrect name has been cor-

rected in this letter.

I did not know whether to
laugh or cry at the comments of
Joel Garrett, 'self—p'roclaimed
leader of the “Pro-Life” (that’s
newspeak for Anti-Choice) group
at Pitt; -.
,Women can ‘choose not to get

' pregnant?! A woman can take all

the precautions available to her
and stillwind up pregnant. There-
fore, according to Mr. Garrett’s

view, pregnancy becomes the ,

punishment a woman must en-
dure for the sin of sexual activity
(outside the bonds of wedlock
and babies). What about the role
men play in this scenario? Will
Mr. Garrett-speak out for forced
sterilization for the so—called guilty

men, as he supports forced moth- ’ "
» gant and fundamentalist cartoons

erhood for us “guilty” women?
Will sex become a crime?

The other alternative, accord-
ing to his beliefs, is celibacy—— in
order to “choose not to get preg-
nant” we women must abstain
from sex (with men, that is) alto-
gether. And after reading Mr.
Garrett’s_ inane, arrogant lecture
about my biology, my reproduc-
tive system and my private life
decisions; after reading that eight

out of 14 of those who showed

up for his meeting were men;
well I'm just about ready to give
up on men altogether. Maybe

celibacy isn’t such a bad idea. '

What do you say, girls? Just say
no? Is sleeping with a guy worth
jeopardizing your constitutional
rights? . ‘

Mr. Garrett's lack of under-
standing concerning the condi-
tions of life for poor women in

this country is disconcerting to

say the least. He will never be
affected by a law making abor-

 

tion illegal. His concern for life
does not respect mine; his con-
cern for the “unborn” does not
include the “born.”. No man has
rights or power over my body or

. my most difficult life decisions,

_nor over my private life. Women
are not breeders; those days went

out with witch burning. And I for '

 

one will not go back.

The cartoon was not funny

The Nov. 13 issue of your paper
contained one of the most arro-

on page 6. On the bottom of the
page was a cartoon of East Ger-
mans escaping through the Berlin
Wallonly to fall down off a cliff.
If this is supposed be a joke, the
joke should fall on your cartoon-
ists. ' . 9
Has your paper ever gone to
realize the pain and struggle that
these.East Germans went through

to get what everyone around the I

world needs; freedom? Many
brave people went through suc-
cessfuHy before this historic oc-
casion took place. Does your
cartoonist also realize how many
people were killed trying to
achieve the freedom they could
never cgbtain? Obviously, your
cartoonist probably thinks of the
event as just a publicity stunt or a
commercialization ploy.‘ Obvi-
ously, he never had the time to

' read his history books or checked
the papers and the cover stories ,
‘on Time and Newsweek.

. Happy Thanksgiving and keep
those cards and letters coming...
a The Pitt News 434 William Pitt Union    

  Celibacy may be good solution

The only people who would _

think less of the freedom of these
East Germans are people who do
nothing but drink beer, praise
Ollie . North, think less of the
unfortunate, and act like a horse’s
ass.‘The communist party of East
Germany is probably crying in
their beer. Is your cartoonist a
beer-drinking, Ollie-loving, con-
ceited, horse—assed communist?
If he is, he shouldn’t be on this
paper and on this campus even if
the editor in chief is a conserva-
tive. .

. You can make a joke out of the
East Germans but you can’t make
a joke out [of] the pain and suffer-
ing of those who ask for free-
dom.

Let’s bring in better speakers

On Wednesday, Nov. 15, I
visited Indiana University of
Pennsylvaniato see Justice San-
dra Day O’Connor of the Su-
preme Court give a wonderful
speech. This lecture series at IUP
has in past years also brought
Carl Sagan, Marvin Kalb, Beverly

Sills, William F. Buckley Jr. and ,

Alexander Haig to speak at this
medium—sized state university.

I was impressed by this roster
of nationally renowned lecturers
almost as _ much ‘as I was dis-

gusted by the absence of such '

speakers at Pitt. The Pitt Program
Council apparently is far more
interested in providing the inane

spectacle of Ken Ober and Colin 

Quinn (of Remote Control fame)
than in acquiring speakers’ with
influence in and knowledge of
our country's affairs.

At an institutionof higher learn-
ing, such addresses expose stu-
dents to provocative viewpoints
and perspectives that are ex-
tiernely valuable in creating a
balanced education. It is a dis-

grace that a university of our size -

is outdone in this area by a much
smaller state university with more
limited resources.

English departrneint not to blame — past apathy the cause

Allen Ginsberg came to the
University of Pittsburgh to read
poetry. Although he is just a
poet/folksinger, he is a pretty
famous one at that. Many people
consider Ginsberg to be “the most
inﬂuential and important poet of
our era.” Sure, Ginsberg doesn’t
have the mouth or the following
that Morton Downey Jr. has, but
he is a celebrity — especially
among demented English majors
such as myself, or anyone that
would like to (do I dare say it?)
learn something.

People from all over Pittsburgh,
including students from Pitt and
CMU, came to hear Ginsberg’s
performance. Some people even
traveled from as far away as West
Virginia to hear Ginsberg read
his well-known poetry. One of
the reasons for such a tremen-
dous turnout was the vast amount
of publicity that Ginsberg received
on the ‘radio and in Pittsburgh
newspapers, including In Pitts-
burgh. '

The reading didn’t start until 8
p.m., but the auditorium was
filled with enthusiastic fans way
ahead of time. I arrived at the
Public‘Health building at 7.45-
and I couldn’t even get to the
doors, which were surrounded
by a group of very angry people.

The crowd waited and-tried

_ many techniques to get in. At

about 8:15, half a dozen Pitts-
burgh police ofﬁcers came and
told the crowd, “Nobody’s gettin’
in. Ders no more room,” and
began to disperse them. How-
ever, some enthusiastic fans found
a side ﬁre door and sneakedin.
Ginsberg was happy to let them
come in and sit on the stage with
him, and told the audience to try
to make room for more people to
stand against the walls and. sit in
the aisles. Although this was done,
a lot of people were stilllturned

Now the English department

has been barraged with angry

« words and criticisms from people .

who were unable to get into the
poetry reading. These people feel
that the English department was
very sloppy in the handling of
the event. Many have said that
the event should have been held
in a larger auditorium — like
David Lawrence_Hall, where both
sides of the huge auditorium were
apparently not being used.
Lynn Emanuel, associate pro-

fessor of the English department, I

was basically responsible for

 

Ginsberg’s booking. She collabo-
rated with the rest of the English
department to select the Public
Health auditorium as the loca-
tion. She noted that sherdid not
foresee such an enthusiastic turn-

out. “Two or three years ago

[Ginsberg] read at [Pitt]. Only
about 150 people showed up.
Eight years ago, he read at the
Three Rivers Arts "Festival, and
there was a small turnout there.
We did not expect to have this
many people show up. Nobody
ever shows up‘ [for the other
poetry readings], so we didn’t
expect this many people," she
said.

Although there was a lot of

press about Ginsberg’s appear-
ance, Emanuel did not promote
the reading as a huge event. She
said, “We saw this thing as a
different kind of an event. We
were not bringing in Ginsberg as
a celebrity. Ginsberg was here
for political reasons. [He] is not
the Rolling Stones.” Besides the
reading in the Public Health
building, Ginsberg also lectured

Emanuel’s honors class — Politi-
cal Poetry.

Emanuel feels that David Law-
rence would not be the right
place for Ginsberg. She explained
that the acoustics there were not
right, and she wasn’t sure if both
sides of the auditorium would be
free, giving Ginsberg a quiet place
to perform. Emanuel said, “If I
had put him in David Lawrence
and there was a lot of noise, he
would have been very upset. He
is somebody that cares a lot about
the presentation of his poetry,

being that a lot of his poetry is
sung. Both sides of the [David
Lawrence] auditorium were not
guaranteed to be open. He has
an extremely strict rider to his
contract. He calls for certain kinds.
of microphones, stage set—up,
flowers — a certain type of tea.
Plus, We felt that David Law-
rence would be too large, and
overall not the right place for
Ginsberg.”

At the event the people who
were not getting in complained
that it should be moved to an-
other hall. Emanuel stated that
that would have been illogical:
“We would have had to make
calls, pack up the equipment,
move it, set it up again— plus get
Ginsberg’s OK to postpone the

‘reading for an hour or two. It

wouldn’t have worked.

“This was not an event that
anyone was guaranteed to get
into,” Emanuel added. “I do feel
badly because so many people

couldn’t get in, but we did the’

best’ we could. What people

should do is petition to bring him

back.” ,

What it basically comes down
to is this —— the Public Health
auditorium was selected by the
English department for its aver-
age size. If the reading had
attracted the small audience that
the English department had pro-
jected and had been held in the

Army Vs. Marines: solvingprodems?

Pee Wee Herman is a Marine.

correctly; that pencil-necked
geek with a voice slightly higher
than a schnauzer with itsivitals

' cu_t off, was named an honorary

Q3‘. a

member of that esteemed group

of jarheads. Why? Apparently,
Pee Weeis on the national board
of Toys For Tots, and they just
happen to be the U.S. Marine
Corps’ favorite charity.

My father, an ex-Marine who
still sports his jarhead hairdo 30
years after his discharge, was
slightly disgruntled by Pee Wee ’s
induction. After teasing him in a
not-so-good-natured-way for a
few minutes, an idea struck me.
What if the Marines’ only reason
for existence was to raise money
for charity? '

I-Immm. They could take all 0

of the money thatthey get from
the budget and funnel it into
charity. And since they would
no longer need all those guns
and tanks and things, they could
sell them (I bet the Army would
buy them) and use that money

too. ‘ »

Soon, I bet the leaders of the
Army, Navy and Air'Force would
see what was going on and
follow suit. Then, instead’ of the
armed forces voicing their dis-

_ agreements through barroom,

brawls, they could settle any

 

 

a disagreement by seeing‘ who
 could raise more money for The —

Christian Children’s Fund or Save
the Whales. ’

' This idea would probably go

- over well. with our allies in

Europe too. I’m sure the citizens
of West Germany and England
would rather have Goodwill
boxes in their countries than
cruise missiles. And if the NATO
armed forces joined in, we could
probably wipe out world hun-
ger in a matter of months.

A By now, all of you conserva-

tive weenies out there are say-

ing that this idea is absurd. You

probably think that while the

every town in America. Well, all

we ‘would have to do is get

Georgie Bush to convince Gorby

at their upcoming summit to ‘

join in. Imagine the headlines:
“Red'Army Raises Cash for RIF”
or “Red Navy Delivers Toys
World Wide.”

Instead of the Cold War, we i

could start a giving war. At the
end of each year there could be
a huge ceremony, and the armed
service that raised the most _

money would get a huge bronze. —

monstrous David Lawrence Hall,
that would have been worse than
having the event in a hall that was
not large enough.

Imagine what it would feel like
to perform for 200 people sitting
in an auditorium built for a couple
thousand. Plus, the reader has to
compete with a pro-choice semi-
nar or something in the next
room that is shaking the flimsy
barrier separating the two halves
of the auditorium. Emanuel be-
lieves that if Ginsberg’s acoustics
had been ruined that way, he
would have been extremely upset
and probably would never have

come back to Pitt.

Although it’s easy to do, you
shouldn’t blame the English
department for the overabun-
dance of people and the under-
abundance of seats. The depart-
ment had been predicting a small
crowd, similar to the small crowds
that come to the rest of the poetry
readings. The fact that Ginsberg
got a lot of publicity in Pittsburgh,
thus pulling a larger crowd than
expected, is not the fault of Pitt’s
English department.

Marie Staf is a columnist forThe
Pitt News.

On Thursday at 12:30 p.m.,
one the Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity campus, 20-year-old
“artist” Jessica Caplin intended
to artistically express herself
by burning, an American flag
as part of an artistic perform-
ance. There are people on
both sides of the issue of flag
burning, and it’s a debate that
will continue for a long time.
It isn't completely my inten-
tion to present another argu-
ment against burning flags,

those who use their right to
“artistic expression” -to inten-

but to state my, case against.

Flag-burnmgfor art's sa/ee

reasonably concluded that the
performance was another pro-
test against the American gov-
ernment. Others may have-
interpreted Caplin’s work of
art as a personal (and, in the ‘
end, muddled and pointless)
form of creative expression.
The fact is, her cherished right
to express herself has need-
lessly interfered with the rights‘ a
of others in moreways than
one. It’s her right to do it, but
did anybody really hear her .
generally accepted wish for

I “global unity”? Peopleshowed

up, but peace was the last

 

Of course, what qualifies as
art is a matter of opinion. Her
performance was to consist of
the burning of several national
ﬂags and then mixing the ashes

' in a globe to symbolize a new
beginning for the world. How
profound. For Caplin’s next
work of art, maybe she’ll start
a forest fire to symbolize
America's continuing ecologi-
cal self—destruc.tion.

Why did Caplin find it nec-
essary to involve and further
-inflame the heated issue of
flag burning in her simplistic
and universally accepted plea
for global unity? Perhaps she
feels that potentially danger-
ous situations such as flag
burning rallies will bring us all
closer together. I’m sure you
could just smellthe love in the
air between Caplin’s support-
ers and CMU’s College Repub-
licans Club. Unless she’s been
in Tibet practicing her pyro-
technics for the last few years,
Caplin surely realized that her
performance would cause

~ major problems -—— an intelli-
gent first step in.uniting‘us all.

I’m not arguing for apathy,
just for responsibility. When
Jessica Caplin decided to per-
form her show, she jeopard-

‘ ized her own safety and that of

- others in a vain, selﬁsh at-
tempt to bring ' attention to
herself. The saddest aspect of
the whole affair is her state-
ment, “If the intended mes-
sage reached one person, I’ve
done what I set out to do.”

What exactly was the mes-
sage people interpreted from
the fiasco? Some may have

created to be appreciated. Jes-
sica Caplin, you are no artist-.
As for those who burn the
flag intentionally—— enjoy your
freedom in a more intelligent
way. Get it together and realize
that the citizens of the world’s
banana republics are already
doing it for us. To many Ameri- ,
can citizens, pride is the issue.
But it’s also an issue of respon-
sibility and integrity. Sadly, flag -
burning has become a wildly
rebellious, newly discovered
and recently popularized form
of protest against our govern-
ment. It’s also a lot less effec-
tive, more offensive and more
infringing on public safety (and
the “unity” Caplin yearns for)
than, say, stating your griev_- .
ances in a more defined

manner, such as putting them

on paper— or even just speak— f

audience. I _ '

. The bottom line is, ﬂag burn-
ing in this country as a form of

protest does nothing but relay ' . 

a broad and obvious message
that ‘ accomplishes nothing
except to say, “I have a prob-
lem with my country.” Every-
body does, and those who
really care about the country's
problems go out and do some-_ ,
thing constructive about them.

Adam Walsh didn’tchange CIA  ‘ "

policy concerning kidnapped
children by igniting the Stars
and Stripes in a merely sym-
bolic act of protest. People
who burn the flag surely real-
ize that doing so just causes yet ’
another problem.

Pitt Men's
celebrates

’ Chris McCall
For The Pitt News

Though they are the oldest
student organization on
campus, members of the Pitt
Men's Glee Club are surprised
with the membership increase
— just in time for its centennial
celebration.

thought that we'd have this
many members," said Jamie
Kazacos, tour manager for the
club’s 100th year.

In 1982 the Glee Club only
had four members; in 1987 it
had eight. Now it has 29.

“A lot of the increase in
participation has to do with
the enthusiasmof members;
we have fun-loving people,”

. said President John Brice.

Nobody knew about the
club in the early ’80s, Brice
said, and the revival is due to
the adoption of a quote from
the records of the 1901 Glee
Club, “promote sociability.”

In the Glee Club's efforts to
promote sociability, it has
increased membership and
events, such as last month's
performance with the women
of Hood College.

“Hopefully «the Hood

to Pitt soon, because all 29 of
us had a great time with all 70
of them,“ said Brice.

“Two years ago no one ever .

Women will be making a trip"

Glee Club
centennial

The Glee Club was
established in 1890 by John L.
Hughs, “The Father of the Glee
Club,” as an extracurricular
activity. In 1926, after operating
with various ensembles, the
members formed the PMGC.

In the early ’80s the club _

suffered a “series of severe
budget cuts,” said Brice, “which
would account for the loss of
membership.”

The club’s reconstruction in
1985 was due to the dedication
of director John P. Yankee,
and resulted in a tour of the
Washington, D.C., and
Baltimore areas.

Kim Ranch is the current
director and this, her second
year, marks the longest stay of
a director since Yankee.
“Before Kim we had five
changes in six years,” ‘said Jeff
S Rosenthal, publicity director.

The Glee Club kicked off its
centennial year Sunday with
the 100th annual fall concert at
Heinz Chapel. The chapel was

filled with parents, alumni and ‘

those who wanted to see the
oldest extracurricular
organization at Pitt.

Next semester, March 16-18,
the Glee Club will hold a
weekend concert and get-
together with Glee Club alumni
to try to raise funds for a trip to
Europe. The club plans to visit
and perform in six countries.

environmental problems and
events for Earth Week, held from

April 16 through 22, according to

Fineberg and Darin.

“This is an international event.
Earth Day is April 22, and there
will be a climb of Mount Everest
by a team made up of people
from China, the Soviet Union and
the United States. They will take
down waste left from other
expeditions,” said Fineberg.

Locally, CLEAN and other local

environmental groups will rally .

in Point State Park. “Three weeks
prior to Earth Day, we are going
to collect Styrofoam and make a
sculpture,” said Fineberg.

“Overall, CLEAN wants to make *

[the community] aware of
environmental problems and
inspire the students and faculty
to take action. We want to get
restaurants to stop using
Styrofoam and get the bars to
recycle their glass and aluminum
products," said Darin. “We are
trying to protect the Earth, not
only for ourselves, but for our
kids.” ”_ __g

Staff Writers

Faculty and experts from both
the University of Pittsburgh and
New York’s Hahnemann
University will attempt to increase
AIDS awareness in an audio
teleconference which will be held
today at the Western Psychiatric
Institute and Clinic auditorium.

“The main goal of the
teleconference is to provide an
overview of diagnostic and
treatmenteissues relevant to the

primary care of persons infected _

with the Human
Immunodeficiency Virus,” said
Linda Frank—Hertweckmsn, co-
principal investigator for the
Pennsylvania/New York AIDS
Regional Education and Training
Center.

The center is based at the
University of Pittsburgh’s
Graduate School of Public Health
in the department of Infectious
Diseases and Microbiology.
Funding for its activities comes
from the Bureau of Health
Professions of the Health

Resources and Services
Administration and the U.S.
Public Health Service.

The teleconference is titled
“AIDS: Advanced Medical
Issues,” and is the second in a
series of six lectures which began
on Oct. 17 and will continue
through May. The first
teleconference dealt with HIV
testing issues. Future sessions
will deal with AIDS—related topics
ranging from substance abuse to
mental health issues.

\VPTS celebrates ﬁfth birthday

I By Chantal Evans _
Staff Writer

A It’s been five years, and they’re
still rocking.
WPTS will be celebrating its

  ﬁrm birthday with a bash on  
‘ Nov. 27 at Metropol. The five-

band lineup includes Half4Life,

Pleasureheads, the Clarks, the

Cure Experience and Heretix.
Joan Kane, WPTS’s

' promotional director, said, “This

is a chance for people who call in
to see what we look like. It’s
college radio. It’s fun.”
The all—ages show starts at 7:30
p.m. and doors open at 7 p.m.
"There is a $5 admission charge.

= Although it is an all- ages show,

the bar will be open for those 21
and older.

This is the first year that WPTS" "

Macintosh®computers have always been easy to use. But they’ve never
been this easy to own. Presenting The Macintosh Sale.
Throughjanuary 31, you can save hundreds of dollars on a variety
of Apple® Macintosh computers and peripherals. . L ,
So now there’s no reason to settle for an 0rdinaryPC.W1th The I
y- Macintosh Sale’,you can wind up with much more of a computer.
Without spending a lot more money e "

will have a national act, Heretix,
from Boston. Kane said that
another act, the Cure Experience,
should makeup for the fact that
the Cure did not stop in Pittsburgh
on their tour this year.

“Basically [the Cure Experience]
are members of local Pittsburgh
bands working hard on Cure riffs.
They’re not the Cure, but you’ll
never know the difference,” Kane
said. “It’s not a private PTS joke.
The whole idea is fun.”

In the past, the birthday bash
has been held in the William Pitt
‘Union. This is only the second
year PT S has celebrated at
Metropol. Kane said that lastyear’s
turnout was amazing and that
she hopes for an even bigger
turnout this year.

“We want a reputable name for
PT S,” she said. “The whole staff

worked’ together and had some
input into the promotion. We
tried to make the fifth birthday
more special. Heretix fell into
our lap. We’ve been working
hard for a long time.” ’
Kane said that WPTS has been
celebrating its birthday since Aug.

.26, the actual day. Four local

bands preformed at the Bellefield
Annex for a kickoff celebration
to last throughout the year. They
had a top 98.5 countdown of a
five—year record history, and
outside the Union they passed
out cupcakes and condoms.

Kane feels that PT 5 is one of
the only progressive music
stations in Pittsburgh. She said
that the PT S condoms are a
promotional idea.

“That’s pretty progressive, I.

think.” Kane said.

The confines of the
departmental major are
historically a menace to college '
students, since most change
majors at least once during their
college career.

There is, however, an
alternative to the departmental

ex major.
I A program common to other
A universities, the self-designed
major, offers students the
opportunity to assemble their own
personal 36-credit major in the
College of Arts and Sciences. '
Before the program. was
developed in the early ‘1970s, a
student had no other option than
,.__ to conform his tastes within a
' departmental major.

According to Barbara Mellix,
assistant to the dean and overseer
of the self-designed major, “The
first step for the ‘student in the
self-designed major is becoming

and weeding out and reﬁning
them." A ‘

Often during a discussion with
Mellix, the student realizes his
interests are represented by a
major that CAS already_offers or
by a dual major. Mellix says it is '
important for the student to first
have a good idea of what his
interests are and how those
interests correspond to traditional
majors. The student should also
have‘ a good idea for a self-
designed major and even a rough
course sketch before he meets
with -her to discuss it.

After speaking with Mellix, the
student typically chooses two

faculty members to assist in the '

creation of I the major and its
respective courses. These faculty
members are typically related to
the ﬁeld or ﬁelds represented by
the major, and remain advisers to
the student through his
subsequent years in the major.
Mellix says, “The importance
of the advisers is that they ensure
the depth and direction involved

Once the student has chosen‘

course list, he then submits a
proposal for his major to Mellix,
who either approves or rejects it,

Even though the Pitt-Penn State game
will » be played this year while most
students are home for Thanksgiving break,
students at PSU say that the rivalry is still

. alive and well.

“With Pitt and Penn State, there’s always
a lot of emotion. Even though neither
team is in the race for a major bowl, it
should still be a great game," said Daryl
Miller, a junior.

“Most people think Pitt sucks,” said
sophomore Tricia Biddle. “People at Pitt
probably feel the same way about Penn
State.

“Everybody’s excited. A lot of people I

know are going to the game," she added.
“I hope we win. In fact, I know we’ll
win.

The Thanksgiving holiday has,
however, dampened on—campus
enthusiasm for the game, according to
many students.

“Because it’s away, everyone’s kind of
like ‘Oh well.’ I don’t think it bothers
anyone, because we know that Penn
State is academically superior. [Pitt] is
inferior in many aspects," Kim Hilty said.

Bob Schamroth said, “As far as the
dorms, most of them close. Hardly anyone
is staying here over Thanksgiving. People
are going home and watching the game
on TV.”

Most students also thought that the

71

mi; prrr NEWS, Tuesday, November 21, 1989

rivalry is no longer as important at Penn
State as it is at Pitt. Students no longer
shout, "Sh-t on Pitt” when Panther football
scores are announced at Beaver Stadium.

“Now people just boo if Pitt is winning
or cheer if they’re losing,” said Letha
Klein.

Miller said, “You know how Penn State
students are: ‘Sh-t on Pitt’ and stuff like
that. Nobody really hates Pitt anymore
because the two teams aren’t as good as
they were in the past."

“It gets real crazy when the Pitt-Penn
State game comes here, but it’s not a real
big deal to me, ” Michelle Thompson said.
“I want to beat Pitt, but I’m not fanatical
about it.”

“It’s not that bad, but people joke

Pitt-Penn State rivalry still a concern at Happy Valley I

around a lot,” Bob Schamroth said about

the rivalry.
Brian Moul,a junior, said, “It’s mostly?"-..

about being in the city in Pittsburgh.
People are like ‘Who’d want to go to

Pittsburgh?”
Reid Miller, who graduated from Penn
State in 1963, said that there has been a

rivalry between Pitt and Penn State as

long as he can remember, but agreed that
the rivalry is probably not as intense as in
the past.
“That was. the game when we were?‘

there,” he said. “As far as everybody was
concerned, it was ‘Beat Pitt.’ I'm not so

sure thats true anymore.”

“We want to win this game,” said Daryl
Miller, “just to get a little respect back.”

PS U students claim tbat Oa/elana’ can't compare socially

By Jenifer Crook
Staff Writer

Pitt students often joke about what the
farmers in “Happy Valley” do for fun after
hosing down their manure conveyors after

. dinner. After all, there’s no “O” or Zelda’s

happy- hour to escape to after a day of
rigorous academics. ' '

But according to some “proud to be
Penn Staters,” collegians at University Park
party just as hard as Oakland's
slickers” any given time and day of the

’ week. In fact, some Nittany Lions even

boasted that their social life not only
equals, but outdoes Pitt’s by a landslide.
“We might be out- in the middle of
nowhere, but we’re no more farmers than
you are,” said PSU junior Richard Gosnell.
“There’s a big social life at Penn State.

There’s a lot of people who majorin
partying. You can find a party any night of

' the week, even on Monday and Tuesday.

By Wednesday, it’s crazy. And on the
weekends, every single student complex
is like one big party.”

“Drink.-That’s all we do,” said sophomore
Jen Miller. “And if you’re over 21, I hear
the bar scene is pretty cool. They have ‘bar
tours’ on your 21st birthday starting at
midnight — a lot of places make you
sing.” ‘

Junior Gwenjones said, “We drink non-
stop. I puked right outside the stadium
about three weeks ago. Everyone gets
dmnk before the games.

‘-‘One thing a lot of people do is watch
movies and drink every time a certain
word is said. We watched “Willie Wonka”
last week and drank whenever they said

J;

  
  
 

  

   

‘chocolate’ and ‘Oompa Loompa.’ That’s
big,” she added.

Fraternity parties were cited as a big
weekend activity on campus by PSU junior
engineering major Doug Wilkenson.
“Everyone goes to fraternity parties. It can
be a big problem if you are not Greek. You
have to get on a list, and even if you go
with a friend who’s Greek, the fraternity
and sorority members all are partying in
their own groups.” _

Every PSU student interviewed soundly
agreed on one point -3- getting into a bar
before turning 21 is virtually impossible in
State College. ‘

“They are very strict here because almost
everyone is a student, ' not like in
Pittsburgh,” said Gosnell.

Suzanne Reinhart, a Pitt junior who
transferred from Penn State her sophomore

year, said, “You absolutely have to be 21.»
If your ID says ‘duplicate’ on it, you have”
to show another form of picture ID.”
Though Reinhart thought parties were
fun at Penn State, she thinks “Pitt is much
better, because at Penn State, everything
social is a school activity. If you don’t go
to Penn State parties or Penn State football
games, there’s not much‘to do there. At
Pitt, you can go to the school activities, but
there’s also all the fun and cultural things

‘to do downtown.”

Reinhart doesn’t agree that Pitt students _
are just as much farmers at heart.as the

“[Penn State] is totally surrounded by
cow~ fields. T here's
everywhere. We lived next door to these
two agriculture majors, and their room
always smelled,” she said.

Rivals evenly matched
for their 89th meeting

By Chris Bosak
Sports Editor

Pitt scores a touchdown at home against
any opponent. The band stirs the crowd
by starting the Pitt fight song. The time
comes in the song to say, “Let’s go Pitt!”
No, that’s not what is heard by the
thousands packing the student section.
Instead, a derogatory chant pointed at
Penn State echoes out.

It's a fact: Most Pitt fans are as concerned
with Penn State losing as they are with the
Panthers winning. If Pitt's record is 1-10,
as long as PSU is 0-11, everything is OK in
Pantherville. If Pitt wins, complete
happiness is not felt in Pittsburgh unless
the Nittany Lions lose. But that’s what a
rivalry is all about. ‘

So every other year, when the Lions
come to Pitt Stadium, Oakland- goes
absolutely crazy. Partying starts early and
ends late. To prove this point, when the
Panthers won 10-0 in 1987, the goal posts
were ripped down by overjoyed fans as if
Pitt had just won the national
Championship.

“This is the most important game this
week in college football,” said Pitt head
coach Mike Gottfried. “This isa great and
healthy rivalry. It is one of the top rivalries
in the country.” ’

Pitt won the match—up last season at
Beaver Stadium, 14-7, which secured a

an-c-u-nu

non—winning season for Penn State. But

Gottfried is not letting last season’s victory 7

affect his attitude for this year.

“Penn State seems to be getting ‘better
every game, especially on defense,” said
Gottfried. “They are very difficult to run
and pass against. They are playing with
more confidence this year. I wouldn’t call
our last two victories against them success,
but rather that we’ve been fortunate.”

Another big‘ difference in the Lions
from last year is Blair Thomas. Thomas
had 1,414, yards rushing in 1987, but the
senior tailback missed last season due to
a knee injury. This year he is back and
having another "great season. He has
1,110 yards so far this year, including 132
against Notre Dame last week.

“Blair Thomas is the best back we’ll
face,” said Gottfried. “lt’s nice to see him
return successfully. I’m not going to be
happy to see him this Saturday, but it's
nice to see him doing well.”

“Blair’s return means more to us than
just his physical ability,” said PSU Coach
Joe Paterno. “He is a very committed
young man. We have not had anybody
on this campus in the /10 years I have
been here that has worked any harder,
practices any harder, has been more
committed, more loyal and who is better
liked than Blair Thomas. His return means
a great deal to the intangible part of our

football team.”

Pitt senior safety Dan
Crossman feels that stopping
Thomas is an impossibility.
“You’re not going to stop him;

, you have to try to limit him and

avoid giving up the very big
plays. He’s a great player, and
he’s going to get his big plays.”

After looking good in Pitt’s
losses to Notre Dame and Miami,
the Panther defense looked lax
against the East Carolina Pirates,
giving up many big plays and 42
points. “We didn't play well at
all against ECU. But we can’t
look behind us; nothing is going
to change. We have to regroup.
We realize our mistakes and are
working hard on correcting
them,” said Crossman.

Penn State quarterbacks Tony
Sacca and Tom Bill will be two
more key players for the Panthers
to stop. Sacca is listed first on
the depth chart, but both have
seen a lot of time, and no one‘ is
sure yet who will see more time
on Saturday.

“I would expect to see both
quarterbacks,” said Gottfried.
“Bothof them do good things
and pose problems for defenses.”

Pitt has a dangerous

quarterback/running back

combination of its own. Alex
Van Pelt leads the Panther aerial
attack and now has over 2,000
yards passing. Sophomore
Curvin Richards, who had 267
yards rushing against ECU, has
over 900 yards on the season.

Andre Collins, senior
linebacker for Penn State, will
be the main man in charge of
stopping Van Pelt and Richards.
Collins, whom Paterno called
the best linebacker to play for
Penn State, has over 100 tackles
for the second straight year.

Blocking Collins and the rest
of the Penn State defense may
be a problem for Pitt. Pitt’s All-
American candidate center/
guard Dean Caliguire will miss
the remainder of the regular due
to a broken ankle suffered in the
ECU game. According to
Gottfried, Caliguire could be
back for the John Hancock Bowl.
Tackle Roman A Matusz also
limped off the ﬁeld during the
ECU game, but should be able
to start on Saturday. Bill Cherpak
will replace Caliguire at guard.

So state bragging rights are on
the line this Saturday. Penn State
is favored in the game, but if Pitt
pulls off the upset, stadium
officials better watch out for
flying goal posts.

By Ron Ledgard
Staff Writer

The Lady Panthers volleyball
team made its mark in the record
books this past weekend as it
became the first team in Big East
history to win back—to—back Big
East titles. .

The Lady Panthers defeated
the Syracuse Orangewomen 3-1
in the championship match in
Providence, R.I., this ' past
weekend to claim their second
title in two years.

Since the inception of the
league in 1982, -the championship
has gone back and forth between

‘Pitt and Providence, with the

Lady Panthers winning the
inaugural championship.

The title game started with the ‘

Orangewomen jumping to a first
set victory 17-15. “Syracuse was
really fired up and took us in the
first,” said Pitt head coach Sue
Woodstra.

The way the Big East
conference is structured, Big East
teams only play one another in
the tournament. This being the
first year for Woodstra at Pitt, she

As for the
chances of Pitt
making the NCAA
tournament this

year, Woodstra
said, “It's still pretty
close.

said Woodstra. “They

picked us up, too.”

‘ The Lady Panthers won thelast
three games (15-5, 15-9, 15-10).

Big East Player of the Year. Dee
MacAuley and Sheils were named
to the all—tournament team.

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Tuesday, November 21, 1989

 

We at The Pitt News Sports

f'-;‘ Department have been able

to successfully tap into Santa
Claus’ fax line. Here are some
of the more interesting
Christmas correspondences
that have recently transpired
between the sports world and
the North Pole:

Dear Santa Claus,

Look man, last Christmas I

I asked you for a couple of sacks,

and you dropped oﬂ two cheap
burlap grain bags. Whats up

with that? What I meant was I

something likeBoomerEsiason’s
head on a plate-— you know,
quarterback sacks. Look man, I
need your help big time on this.

I ’m gettin ' desperate/I

Sincerely, Aaron Jones

Dear Aaron,

Well, I really can’t promise
you any quarterback sacks, as
that would probably violate the
Old NFLPA collective bargaining
agreement in some way, and the
last thing I need is Paul Tagliabue
on my back. But if you want,
you can come up here to’ the
North Pole and swan dive on a

 couple of my elves while they're
" sleeping.

Yours, Santa

Dear Santa Claus,

I have more money than you
will ever dream about having,
and I’m only an NFL rookie.
How long have you been working

for? Probably a lot longer than I
ever will. I ’m just dropping you
a note to see I can buy you any
sleigh wax orsomething. Ha Ha
Ha. Merry Christmas to me.

Sincerely, Burt Grossman

Dear Wise Guy,

I know where you live. How
does a chimneyful of reindeer
dung sound?

Seriously, Santa.

P.S. What was the score of the

 

Steelers—Chargers game again?

Dear Saint Nick,
The binding to my playbook is
broken, and the pages are all
faded and coffee—stained. All I
:,want is a new copy, one thats in
good shape that ’llgetme through
the next 20 years. Thanks.
Sincerely, Chuck Noll

Dear Chuck,

Please Contact the Smithsonian
Institution, as they know much
more about that type of
restoration than I do..And, just
out of curiosity, how did you
get ahold ofone of the Dead Sea
Scrolls in the first place?

Dear Santa Claus,

We, the RoseBowl Committee,
are the last bowl game that has
not allowed a corporate sponsor
to add its name to the game. So
as to keep up with the joneses
(and the john Hancock Bowl),
we are going to drop the title
“Rose. ”All we ask for Christmas
is that you recommend to us a
good corporation with which
we can become affiliated. Thank

You.
Sincerely,
Committee

The Rose Bowl

Dear Rose Bowl Committee,
I have compiled’ a list of
possible bicorporate sponsors
for you right here, just to give
you a good selection. How about
these: The Spacely Sprocket/
Chan Van Inc. Bowl, The Roto-
Rooter/ Sly and the Family Stone
Bowl, The Johnstown Johns
Bud’s Fruit Stand Bowl, or The
Jiffy Lube/Pittsburgh "Nipple
Works Bowl.‘ ~ I
In other words, being the
traditionalist I am, I don’t like
the idea.
Sincerely, Santa

Dear Santa Claus, .

I ’ve been kinda depressed
lately. All I want for the holidays
is a good joke to cheer me up.

Sincerely, Mike ‘Gottfried,

CHALLENGE YOUR MIND,

 

Head Coach, Pitt Football

P.S. I've never seen a better
group of-reindeer than the ones
you have. They have exceptional
quickness, great strength and
probably more team speed than
East Carolina.

Dear Mike,

Here are two good Ones for ya,
Mike: Check out the Notre Dame
and Miami game films.

Yours truly, Santa

Dear Santa- Claus,

I ’m just writing to you to thank
you for last year’s Christmas
present. That straight face really
came in handy, especially when
I made the ridiculous comment
about us passing up a bowl game
this year, or about how I would
retire ifwe had any morepregame
ﬁghts with our opponents like we
did before the USCgame, orabout
how upset I was when I said that
our defense played horrendously

- last week againstPenn State, or. . ..

.. . Yours in Faith, Lou Holtz, Notre
Dame Football

Dear Lou,

I see that shovel I sent you
back in 1977 isn’t doing the job,
so I am sending you two backhoes
and a storage silo that_ might
work a little better. I can see that
you have gotten ridiculously out
of hand.

Seriously Sincerely, Santa

the Nittany Lions.

On Sunday, the ’ Panthers

Slippery Rock opened the

that was the only goal it could
muster against Hugo. Hugo
stoppedcthe next 28 shots he
faced to lead the Panthers to
victory.

The Rock used all
goaltenders it brought to the
game, but none of them could
slow the Panthers.

Panther scoring was led by
Tony T ravato and Koval, each
having four-point games. The

game-winning goal was cre dited-

toJohn Carlins, with assists going
to Mike Cuchran and Ed
Gregor: nichik.

The other Panther goals went
to Eugene Barilla, Brian Spitzer
and Mark Granatire, each with
two. goals, and Gregorchichik,
Crousey and Skolansky each
adding a goal.
