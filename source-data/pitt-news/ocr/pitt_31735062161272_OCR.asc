Civil Defense Wardens Picked

By DAVE WINTER

“Move to the
building, please.”

If you are in school when sirens.
warn that an atomic attack may be
coming, obeying commands like
the one above may keep your name
off the list of casualties.

Recognizing the lead for or-
ganized leadership in case of an
air raid, the University’s Civil
1 Committee has already
appointed wardens for 22 of the
University's 25 buildings, and for
every floor in the Cathedral of
Learning. Dr. Louis Johnson,
assistant professor of political
science, has been named chief
warden.

Drills Must Wait

Actual air raid drills to give
students practice in moving
quickly from classrooms to shelter
areas will not be held until the
city and county siren system is
revived.

Besides appointing ‘avardens,
Viers W. Adams, Ellsworth Center
director, and his CD committee are
following the “Be prepared” motto
in other ways. Posters are being
printed giving instructions to be
followed by students and faculty
in case of an air raid alarm.

Pocket size sets of cards giving
survival secrets have already been
distributed to Air ROTC classes,
and a small supply of 10 cent
pamphlets, ‘Survival Under Atomic
Attack,’ has been put on sale at
Student Desk.

CD Office Opened

Adams will soon open a CD
control information center in G-4'7
Cl., now being used as a store-
room by the University bookstore.
The office will be open each Tues-
day and Thursday afternoon from
1230- 5:00 p.m. beginning March 1.

What can you do to be prepared
when and IF the threat of a bomb-
ing attack does materialize?
Adams says: “Students and faculty
are urged to learn how to protect
themselves by memorizing simple
survival secrets. Casualties from
a bombing attack can be reduced
by as much as 50 per cent if
people move quickly to protect
themselves and avoid hyster_ia.

Hadacol for
Congestion Relief

If you have your ups and downs,
if Hadacol and the elevators fail
to give you a lift, it you find the
Bigelow and Belleiield stairways
are too congested for you to use.
Roy Titchworth, president of Men's
Councilmay havea solution to your
problem.

At least as far as the stairs are
conoemed.

Titchworth has broached a sug-
gestion to the Buildings and
Grounds Department that one of
the stairways be used strictly for
up traffic and the other for down.
This, he believes, would relieve the
congestion that predominates at
these locations during class chan-
ges.

Theodore W. Biddle, dean of
men, approved of the idea but sug-
gested that Titchworth sound out
the student body for their opinion
on the subject.

Additional speakers are Dr. Ho-
wlrd C. Scharfe, member of Pitt's
Board of Trustees; Robert 1.. James,
secretary of the Student Christian
Movement in the Middle Atlantic
region; Allyn P. Robinson, a direc-
tor of the National Conference of
Christians and Jews; Dr. Edmund H.

Finale Night” which includes
doubleheader basketball, a dance,
a special fraternity award, music
by the Polecats, and appropriate
Stadium closing ceremonies.

Aim to Fill Seats

It is the aim of those behind
this affair — the Athletic Depart-
ment, lnterfratemity Council, and
Sam Shapiro, representing the
Lettermen’s Club to fill the
Stadium to its 2800 capacity and
root the Panthers to a memorable
victory.

Merely the appearance of West
Virginia here should be enough
to attract a large crowd. There
could be no fitter close to the
Stadium than a game between these
two arch rivals.

-Workman Dangerous

Pitt bowed to the Mountaineers
at Morgantown last week, 56-52,
when ‘the sensational 6-9 Mark
Workman scored 31 of his teams
points.

“We've got a way to stop him
Monday,” confides Carlson, but
he won't reveal his secret weapon. Q

Plenty of fireworks are in store
if past Pitt-West Virginia games
here are any indication. Pitt edged
the hillbillies last year at, the
Stadium, 55-53, in a thrilling game
marked by a near brawl.

Seniors End Careers

Four Pitt hoopsters Mike
Belich, Bob Yurko, George Hro-
manik and George Radosevich -
are making their final appearances
of their college careers before
local fans.

The freshmen preliminary to the
big contest matches the high-
scoring Bobby Artman’s classy
"Pitt five.
6:45 and the varsity game starts
at 8:15.

West Virginia’s frosh won the
first game at Morgantown, 86-69.
They have averaged 84 points a
game. ’

Before the varsity game starts,
special ceremonies will be held
which will include individual intro-
duction of the starting players for
each team.

Gift At Halftime

At halftime, the fraternities will

hold forth, and the fraternity with

the best percentage of its mem-

bers at the game, will receive a
basketball autographed by Carlson
and the Pitt players.

_And last, but not least, a dance,
with music by the Polecats, is
going to be held after the game on
the Stadium floor. The dance is
open to the public.

Monday night should be a night
to remember. The occasion cer-
tainly merits a packed house at
the Stadium.

Sam Shapiro reports that the
Mountaineers are boasting "they'll

' bring enough fans to fill the Sta-

dium themselves.”

Religion-in-Life Speakers Announced

Kase, Wilson College professor of
religion; Chaplain Robert M. Hornis-

Free Movie

Will Give

Atom Dope

Pitt students will get a dozen
chances to learn a “Pattern for
Survival” under atomic attack. A
25 minute color film with this title,
describing atomic attack and show-
ing what actions civilians should
take to protect themselves, will be
shown March 2 and 16.

The movie may be viewed six
times each day from 10:45 till
3:45.

Alpha Phi Omega, national ser-
vice fraternity, arranged for the
loan of the film with Ross Leffler,
director of civil defense for
Allegheny County, Members of the
University civil defense committee
will be available after each show-
ing to answer questions on the
film and on the University’s policy
for civil defense.

The film has already had its
premiere in the office of Viers W.
Adams, director of Ellsworth Cent-
er. Adams and other Pitt civil de-
fense planners who viewed the pic-
ture recommend it as something
that every student should see.

State Creates

New -CD Job:

Pitt is not alone in preparing for
Civil Defense. The State of Penn-
sylvania considers the problem so
vital that it's governor, John S.
Fine, recently set up a new $15,000
a year post — Director of the Civil
Defense Commission for Penn-
sylvania.

The action followed Governor
Fine’s announcement last month
that the civil defense program
would soon be under civilian direc-
tion. The appointment was given
to Dr. Theodore A.lDistler, presi-
dent of Franklin and Marshall Col-

lege in Lancaster, Pennsylvania.

Planning for both civilian and
military defense was formerly under
direction of Major General
Richard K. Mellon of Pittsburgh.
General Mellon still retains his
status as head of the military ad-
visory commission.

First Aid Class

Between 90 and 100 students
have signed up for the civil
defense-sponsored free first aid

Before his sojourn here in Pitts-

when Josiah Kirby Lilly gave the
Foster collection to the University.
This collection of 10,000 items

and records. One ofthe prized pieces
in thegroup, Mr. Hodges pointed out,
is a piano once used by Stephen
Foster in his composing; another
relic is a flute which Foster played
for his personal amusement. His

Doc Carlson never relented in
urging his team to pour it on the
Tartans. It was sweet revenge for
the 66-42 loss at Skibo gym.

The largest home crowd of the
season, 704, turned out for the
game. This’ turnout, however,
should be eclipsed by Monday’s
West Virginia crowd.

Mike Belich was _high scorer
with 18 points to bring him within

show Belich has 359 points, not

 Our feline friend may not be from Missouri, but she sure
likes to be shown! She saw right through those thin, quick-trick, cigarette
tests and realized you couldn’t fairly judge a cigarette’s mildness with a
mere one puff or a swift sniff. Right on the spot, she _decided they weren’t
fur her! Sophisticated, but shrewd, she knew what she wanted.
The Sensible Test . . . the 30-Day Camel Mildness Test,
which simply asks you to try Camels as your steady
smoke—on a pack after pack, day after day basis.
No snap judgments needed. After you’ve enjoyed ..Camels—
and only Camels—for 30 days in your “T-Zone”

(T for Throat, T for Taste), we believe you’ll know why . . .

More People Smoke Camels
than any other cigarette!
