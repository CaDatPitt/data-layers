Villanova, Philadelphia. Bob wants
emphasized, however, that he is a
Marine. _ . _

From Hawaii, Lt; Irv. Kaufmann
writes that he ‘had an interesting

ating class of ‘41. ’ 7 

Lt. Mike De Marco on maneuvers
in California, has visited. Hollywood
and according to ‘him, “The women

John says, “Surprisingly, I am en-

a 5 mile hike, and it wasn’t so bad
 I had thought. In fact, I went to
a dance in town that night, although
at 5:45 the next morning I wished

from low to high C in the-course

quite, unfortunately) drowned out

To coin a phrase, the men just
ain’t got no cents. (Pretty coiny,

‘Men's Glee Club

Slates _Meeting,
Fat Tuesday

There is no doubt that Pitt men
still like their music. Regardless of
the changes made on the University
campus, due to the war, twenty-
nine Pitt men have signed up for
a Men’s Glee Club.

Mr. Theodore Finney, profes-
sor and head of the Department
of Music Appreciation, will serve
as director of the organization.

In previous years the Men’s Glee
Club traveled about the countrynto
various campuses where they pre-
sented musical ‘programs. Last year,
because" of traveling difficulties, the
group was unable to leave the Pitt
campus. Thus, a minstrel show was

substituted for the usual activity.

As considerable interest has
been expressed for a Men’s Glee
Club, both by men in last year’s
club who remained in school and
new students who enjoy this type‘
of activity, an organization meet-
ing took place last Monday. There,
plans for following meetings were
discussed. Another meeting will
be held next Tuesday at 7 :00
o’clock in the ‘Heinz Chapel.

Director Finney stated that al-
though no deﬁnite program has been
scheduled at this early date, men
still interested in signing up with
this group, but who failed to turn in
their names last week, are invited
to come to the meeting Tuesday.

All during the week the Pitt
Army reminisces over the past
weekend and dreams of the next
one. Pittsburgh seems to be ﬁlled

with all the facilities for having a

good time. _
Al Zimmerman and Don Johnson
have been raving all week about
the two beautiful coeds that they
had dateswith last Saturday night.
This" is the same Johnson who is"
planning to have a special phone
put in for himself so his many girls,
can call him. And the worst part is
that when they call there, they
ask for “Honey Bunny”! However,. ,
if that moniker is good enough for, . f
the numerous ﬂames inhis life then
it’s certainly good enough for us.
(Poor Johnson!) A
The open house and the dance
after the game last week was_a
howling success. Although the ﬁrst . _
three hundred soldiers to get there" 
were greeted by only six girls, the
ratio was soon equalized. By the ' _.
time each of the men was faced ’ '.’_"_~"
with a beautiful girl, the courage,’ 
of the soldiers wilted and the girls 
had to use leap-yearrtactics in ask-I 
ing the men to dance. '
‘ After the ice was broken, the. :.-"_t;
soldiers handled their redemption‘-a. 
nicely. Rogers muster the nerve 
to ask a gal to dance, and even if it" " 
was plain to everyone that she was‘, 
a senior,'Rogers dame through.with~""
“Are you a freshman here at Pitt?’
Though the whole side of the ball
room was more than slightly chilled ,
by her response it was quickly"
heated by Sidney Spike's jitterbug-T
ging and everyone had a wonderful!‘-A
time. Here’s to more and bigger‘
“coffee and donut” dances!’ "
If the Pitt Army men do have a,
good time on their own time it‘isn’_t :
interfering with their scholastic
work. Rather than the anticipated
ten percent of men in engineering»
not making the grade, there is legs

it every time)., the other game Pitt
played that weekend also came in
for some discussion. That was the
game‘ the “B” squadplayed with

which was expected, but the .team
madeva good showing, especially in
the secondlhalf, ‘which was not al-

The “B’s?_’ failed to score against
the junior Navy team, but gained
what might be termed a “moral”
victory when they held Navy score-
less in the second half of the game.
Evidently, like their varsity broth-
ers, they are strictly a second-half
team. For, although they failed to
score, the “B’s” brought the few
Sailors who braved the miserable
weather to" their feet, on several
long 30 and 40. yard runs by Bergy

To Contribute _
Practice Games

By HUGH CHAVERN _

“This year,” said Doctor Carl-
son, “we’re, going to have a GOOD
team. In fact they're a later edi-
tion of ,the .Rinkeydinks;’.’ VVhen
“Doc” makes a comparison .like
that, the Rinkydink Juniors must
really have something on the ‘has-
ketball. , '

“They’re aﬁghting ball club,’-? he
went fon, “free’scoring and free
battling and 'they’ll be even. better
when Jones and Malarkey are back

ion - the squad. Malarkey’s good

‘enough to play even‘ if we~'have to
put him out on the floor in a rocking.
chair.” -

The secret weapon of this year’s
team will be the offense, something
which ,Doctor Carlson prefers to
keep quiet for a while. ‘

“The faint hearted boys who were
scared away by my harmless blasts
have gone by this ‘ time,” said
“Doc,” and the ones that are left
couldn’t be scared anyway. They’re
my “Little Toughies.”

Teams of every Army company
and squadron stationed at Pitt will
get their chance toplay the var-
sity in practice games as the Army
does not allow its personnel "to par-
ticipate in any collegiate sports.
‘Games will be played and sched-
uled, for the most part,.to ﬁt the
convenience‘ of the soldier teams.
Whether spectators will be allowed
at these games has not as yet been
decided.

Intensive practice begins Monday
‘for the Little Toughies, and con-
tinues. every weekday thereafter.

A scheduled preliminary game
with NYU in Madison Square Gar-
den on December 28 was cancelled,
and is to be played at a later date.
The ﬁrst away/game will be played
at Ohio State on December 29..

. With ﬁve of the eight games on their schedule completed,
this seems to be a pretty good time to take stock oftlie
Panthers of 1943. - ~ A

The record shows a. respectable three and two count with '

the big‘ one, coming‘ up. And, since tomorrow’s contest with 

Carnegie Tech is merely ﬁgured as an easy way for the Pitts

to limber up and even the record at the same time, they won’_t_ __£ 

get a chance to swing at the -big one until next week when

Ohio State comes to town. - -  

‘ Of the three losses suifered by the Panthers, two were  ,'-1‘

j ustiﬁed and one was not..Certainly, whatever disappointments

there were because of the 41-0 beating administered by Notre  

Dame have gradually disappeared as thescores of the succeed- .

ing weeks roll in. In fact, the Panthers actually seem to have , 

achieved a kind of victory over the Fighting Irish, for they
have the dubious distinction of being the only team, with the _ ,
exception of Michigan, to hold them to a score of less than _ i H
47 points. .

,/V The Great Lakes game can be dismissed as just a nice 
gesture of the University on behalf of Navy morale. ‘

The loss to Illinois ‘hurt the most, for this was a game‘
the Panthers should have won, but for their strange inability
to realized that a football game is made up of two halves and
that both ha.lves count; '

But, strangely enough, criticisms leveled at the Panthers

\ .

have not concerned their losses so much as their wins. For  

the Panthers have made themistake of failing to put on any
kind of a show until the game is almost over. Possibly a course
in playwriting would help them out here, for it is generally, '-
known that the best third act in the world won’t do much
good-. if the first one is so bad that the customers falllasleepi
or walk out. _ ‘I  ,

It is also rather horrible to think of what end the Panthers  “‘
would be on in one of those point, a punt, and a prayer con- I
tests. Out of eleven‘ tries for the point after touchdown (Illi-. .
nqis was offside on one and Pittwas given‘ another chance),
the Panthers have converted only three times. And this has
been not so much a reﬂection on the kicker as it -has been on 
the support tendered by his teammates, for at least ﬁve of 
those kicks were blocked. '

On the credit side, it should be said that the Panthers. ;
ave shown ﬂashes of brilliance, especially when th '~ “T” '3
ffense really begins clicking as it did in the secon half. it
gainst Illinois. And they were about as tight a team defen- 
sively last Saturday as you’d be likely to ﬁnd anywhere. This, :<’\
however, brought the rueful observation from Clark Shaugh- 1 I
nessy that, “We spend the week before Illinois drilling them on 
offense and‘ they went and forgot all they had learned about  '
defense. This week we worked on defense, and they almost for-‘V 
got what they knew about offense.” . ‘ I‘

This has not been an easy team to coach, for a group of 
young players, learning a systems that is, for the most part, J
entirely new to them, will not absorb things as readilyas a”
more experiencedgroup. Furthermore, the Panthers never
could afford to lose a single player and they have lost almost
enough to make up a_good ﬁrst team. Three of the most prom.
ising backs in the summer practices are no longer with the.
team. Carl Mosso left in August, Angelo Carlaccini left fol-'4
lowing the Notre Dame game andfullback Bill Abrom'tis«
played his last game against Illinois two tweeks ago. Losing
tackle Marty.Rosepink, a good man on defense, didn’t help
things either. At present, the Panthers are well fortiﬁed in 
only two positions. At quarterback they have the yersatile 5‘:
Joe Mocha with Joe Kielb, Jack Foleyand Cy Plazak to’ back A
him up. Andthe center position is well taken care of by Ralph

\

  
  
  
  
  
 

The Panthers were promised and have been given the‘;
best in coaching and equipment. What they do from here on in.
is entirely up to them. Most observers agree that they can 1-
best Ohio State and Penn State——if they want to badly enough. .
They have the skills. It is now up to the Panthers to use them‘ I

Joe Mocha, the 17 year old quarterback,-who his Coach
has sometimes compared to Jay Berwanger and Frankie Al.
bert, was the prize dark horse candidate of the season. Joe
was one of three boys slated to come to Pitt from his home 
townof St. Clair. One was a big-fullback, the other abigger 
tackle, and “Little Joe” tended to be overlooked because of —.
his size, despite the. warnings of his high school coach Mike vi
Stranko, that “Joe is the best bet of them all.” ’ * i e

As things turned out, neitherthe tackle nor the fullback.
