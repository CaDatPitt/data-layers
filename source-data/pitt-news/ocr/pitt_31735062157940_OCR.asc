Forty anxious and conﬁdent Panters will ﬂy tomorrow ,

morning to the Southern California campus where they will
do.battle with the Trojan football team Friday night‘.

' Although Head Coach. “Red” Dawson isn’t making any
optimistic predictions, a remark made by co-captain Henry

Ford characterizes the team’

s spirit. “I think ‘we’ll take

them,” says Ford,j“We’re‘l not just going out there for the
trip. We’re ‘going-‘to play ball.»’’..

One advantage the Panthers have is the. fact that most

always-powerful Trojans. A-winby Dawson’s charges would

the weather on the Coast isn’t ex-
actly the best football c1irnate"a
team could hope for-——especially
one not familiar to hot and humid
conditions. The Trojans will also
have a game with Washington
‘State under their belts when they
meet the Panthers. Dawson added
that the west coasters are hard to

In addition the game .will be
played under the lights-——another
condition very unfamiliar to the

did have some practice sessions

liseum where the game will be
played. ,
Considerable concern was caused
by co-captain tackle Lou Palatella
who came up with a sprained foot
last week. However, Dawson in-
forms that the foot has progressed
rapidly and the star tackle will
be ready for the starting whistle.
Offense To Vary
Dawson has great respect for
his bruising tackle. “He’s a great

Reunifieation
Satisfactory To
IF Members

Last year’s split between the
so—called “Big Six” fraternities

was healed last May after a series
of meetings between the two, or-
ganizations. The “Big Six” with-
drew from the Council after their
bill, concerning proportionate rep-
resentation, was sent to a special

action.

After the split the “Big Six”
formed their own “Council of
Fraternities,” writing“ a constitu-
tion _and electi_r_1g their own of-
ﬁcers. Sporting events were or-
ganized and one social event was
held.

At the ﬁrst of the three meet-
ings during May, uniﬁcation was
attempted but failed due to dif-
ficulties in establishing a satisfac-
tory breakdown of votes between
the two organizations. ’

At a subsequent meeting, the
differences were settled and a re-
uniﬁcation resulted. The issues
granted were along “Big Six”
terms. During the third and ﬁnal
meeting, appointments for IF
committees were given out and
the organization started function-
ing normally.

The Dean of Men’s Office, dis-
satisﬁed with the split, played a
major part in the reuniﬁcation.

Remaining members of the “Big
Six” this year expressed the opin-
ion that “it was impractable for
two organizations to exist and
therefore good that they have re-
uniﬁed.” They also expressed
“hopes that difﬁculties have been

straightened ‘out and that ~there ~

would be co-operation within the

Pennsylvania replaced the Tower of Learning as the meeting
place of Pitt’s women leaders and representatives last week
when about 50 members of Women’s Self Government Asso-

of discussion and group life. 4.
The initial meeting of these
WSGA members climaxed a wide
variety of summer ‘experiences
and officially began the women’s
program of activities for the year.
Wednesday afternoon’s discus-
sion plunged the women into the
topic of student government and
its relation to the individual, the
University, the country, and the
world. Later, for recreation,
women scattered over the resort to
enjoy the old swimming hole, ten-

Placement

Regardless of military status,
senior men should register’ with
the Men’s Placement Bureau, ac-
cording to Paul Sherwood, director
of the bureau. ‘

January graduates should regis-
ter with the bureau by Monday,
Oct. 18. Mr. Sherwood anticipates
several companies coming to the
campus this fall but has an-
nounced that senior men who wish
to take advantage of the oppor-
tunities offered by these concerns
should take the following steps.

First, interested men must ﬁll
out registration cards and return
them to the Placement Bureau
with photographs of themselves
attached. The Bureau will then
provide them with interview res-
ervation cards and other informa-
tion needed for interviews.

Dr. Quick Says

University admission r, e c o r d s
show an increase in freshmen reg-
istration this year as compared to
last fall’s decrease.

“The sign is hopeful,” said J. G.
Quick, registrar,” but I prefer
Waiting until the actual registra-
tion can be reported before dis-
closing any deﬁnite statistics.”

The rise is based on the fact that
approximately 850 students have
taken preliminary placement tests
during the summer.

These placement tests, previous-
ly given during Freshmen Week,
were offered to incoming students
at various times during this sum-
mer to permit more time for indi-
vidual consultation.

In keeping with changes in the
registration program, the College
has instituted a new system of
registration orientation for fresh-
men. Small groups of new stu-

dents will meet with faculty ad--

vistors for guidance before enter-
ing Syria Mosque for actual regis-
tration. They will receive infor-
mation about their time schedules,
required courses, and instructions
for registering. Stanton C. Craw-
ford, Dean of the College, has be-
gun this program with the hope
of aiding freshmen.

Summer school enrollment this
year gave an early indication of
increased registration. Net regis-
tration for the six summer sessions
was recorded at 5,439 as compared
with 5,091 for last year. This was
an increase of nearly seven per
cent.

As this issue goes to press the confusion and consterna-
tion of registration once again comes to the fore at the Uni-
versity.,To the entering freshmen this has always signified
the beginning of a college career. To the upper classmen it is
simply a means to an end. But all might do well to think of
it in terms more serious than a few hours spent trying to get

Registering for classes at Pitt entails much more than
simply filling up a schedule with field credits, or .at least it
should. The curriculum at Pitt offers courses in such a wide

variety of fields that the student can ill afford to ignore it.
A second aspect on this theme i sconcerned with the reputa-
tion which some instructors enjoy and which others ignore,

or try to at any rate. Stories entailing methods, personalities, “

appearance, and bathing habits of instructors are usually cir-

culated by students who couldn’t quite reach the grapes.

Studentsilooking for an education as well as a sheepskin

would do well to listen to a faculty advisor rather than a
A student advicegiver. i

No sooner has the student completed registration than he _

is beseiged by the back slapping, hand shaking, drink buying
legions. The members of these groups represent fratenities,
sororities, publications, clubs, and student organizations
bent on gaining new members. Individually, ‘each of these
groups can be beneficial but just as in the case of good
whiskey, too much will place the user in such a position
that he is unable to do anything well. Take your time. Be
selective. «Talk to the faculty-advisors of these groups and
then decide. ‘

. Past experience has shown that the student who emerges
as a leader, who is accepted both socially and academically
by his classmates and by the faculty and administration, is
the student who has learned to get along: with others as well
ashimself. It is this type of student which the University
strives to produce and which the business world wants to
employ. '0 1 P

News stories will appear in accordance with strict news

may be necessary, because of‘ space limitations, to cut a

must run a number of ads to pay for the expense of publica- A

by Jim Deweese

Take 120 students, an equal number of instru-
ments and ‘unlimited determination and you have
the University of Pittsburgh Varsity Marching Band.

One hundred and forty student musicians spent
all of last week, with a couple of extra days thrown
in for good measure, on the rain soaked drill ﬁeld
at Camp Kon—O—Kwee perfecting routi.r\es~WhiCh
were born in the minds of Rob-
ert Arthur and Benny Benack
before the endof last semester

According to Band Director
Robert Arthur, the halftime rou-
tines which the group will em-
ploy this year include formations
which have’ never before been
attempted by a marching band
in this country. All of the for-
mations will be‘ motivated, por

 

 

traying subjects such as a racing shelllor a swim-
mer with the entire band going through the motions
and creating a. very real illusi-on of movement.
These formations went through three months of

myriad variations and innumerable changes on

_paper before the band members got their initial

instructions.

Band Looks Flashy

Perhaps the most striking tihng about this year’s
group isjthe spirit and determination which was
so evident at the camp. This aspect was pcinted
up last Tuesday night while the band was drilling
on one of their most difficult routines on the ﬂood
lighted practice ﬁeld. The practice was going on
during a determination dampening drizzle when
a generator failure resulted in an almost total black-
out. The director abandoned all thoughts of drill and

  

ordered the members up to the recreation building

_ to run through some of the music; Within ten inin-

utes the entire, band was back down on the ﬁeld.
Each member, in addition to his instrument, now

"held a ﬂashlight. No one left the ﬁeld until the for-

mation was perfected. It is to actions such as. this

which Mr. Arthur refers when he says, “,Our only’

aim is to be perfect.”

Complete co-operation is one of the keynotes

of the band. This is achieved through the efforts
of some of the non-playing members of the band.
Two 20 ft. towers stand on either side of the ﬁeld

with a two way telephone system between them...

From these vantage points the directors can spot

‘mistakes which, though not evident ‘from ﬁeld

level, are only too noticeable from the stands dur-
ing an actual performance.
Hi-Fi Fits Fine \
The Hi-Fi craze has not left the band untouched
either. Mr. Arthur employs a Hi-Fidelity record-
ing system, as an aide in reaching the stage of
perfection which has become an integral part of
the .band. Before the band begins to ‘drill on their

marching, a complete‘ recording is made of the .

entire half time performance. This is then played
back through an ampliﬁer and the band is free to

concentrate on precision marching without worry- 1

ing about the music. ,

As the formations begin taking shape the mem-
bers add the music and the playback is -cut down
until ﬁnally the band is going through their rou-
tines just as they will be seen at the stadium.
In this manner, the band never deviates from its
cadence of 160 steps per minute, a_ cadence which
ﬁts exactly the band’s style of performing. As ,lVIr.~
Arthur puts _it, “There is no excess music and there
are no excess steps. Everything is exact.”

Buhl Foundation
Awards New Grant

A grant of $127,375 has been
awarded the University by the
Buhl Foundation to support a six-
year Work Study Program in the
School of Social Work.

The new program will enable
persons not professionally trained,
but employed by a social agency,
to receive preparation without in-

terrupting their work-day sched-

ule.

W. I. Newstetter; dean of the
School, said that the grant will
prove valuable to social work
agencies which find it difficult to
hire a sufficient number of profes-
sionally trained employees.

The program is considered
unique because it requires the stu-
dent to meet the same standards
for the master of social work de-
grees as students in the full-time
two year course.

At present “There is a desperate
need for qualified personnel in the
state hospitals, in the rural child

welfare service, and in the public”

assistance program throughout the
state, as well as in our local social
service agencies, both public and
voluntary,” Dean Newstetter add-

eran mentor expects to use both
the T and the single wing. “We’ll
likely use a lot of single wing,”
remarks Dawson. “We have the
material this year whereas we
didn’t have the tailbacks last sea-
son.” _

It appears certain now t hat
southpaw passer Darrell Lewis
will lead the attack from the
quarterback post. Lewis is a
hard—running sophomore, though
lacking in experience.

Left Half To Pass

Rounding out the remainder of
the backﬁeld will be two sophs
and a senior. Ford will operate
from the left half spot with Tom
Jenkins at full and either Nick
Passodelis or Bugs Bagamery at
Jenkins, a 185-pound
soph, appears to have grabbed the
starting assignment from veteran
Bob Grier. With Sophs Passodelis
and Bagamery it’s pretty much
of a tossup.

With this proposed offense,
Dawson advised that the left half
will be expected to do plenty of
passing——-—possibly more than the

quarterback.

(On the line it will probably be
soph" Joe Walton and junior John
Paluck at the ends with Palatella
and Eldred Kraemer at the
tackles.

Sophs Dominate
Closing up the 1 i n e will be
juniors Ed Stowe and Al Bolkavac
at the guard p 0 st s withrulohn
Cenci at center.

A look at the lineup shows
more sophomores than seniors-
four to two with three of the sophs
showing up in the starting 'back-
ﬁeld‘ and one at end. Such lack
of experience is usually a serious
disadvantage but the Panther
coaches are hopeful that ability
will overshadow inexperience.

“We have some good sopho-
mores who are going to. make
great football players for Pitt,”
remarks Dawson, “all they need
is experience.”

the Panthers can expect varia-
tions of the T and the single wing
—an oﬁense very similar to Mich-
igan’s. -

“Do We Have
The Ponies?"

By DAVE MAZER
Sports Editor

 

 

Thls might be called “production year” for the Pitt football team

and Coach “Red” Dawson. The reason for the economic title lies "

in the fact that ﬁnally the golden Panthers have the material to
produce a winning year.

To the observer who would like to object-——we offer these details.
Mr. Dawson is here under a three-year contract which ends at the
conclusion of this grid season. To date he has had a good year, 1952,
when the Panthers ﬁnished with a 6-3’ record, and a bad year, last
fall when the same drooped to a 3-5-1 chart.

While pressure at Pitt to produce winning teams is not as
prevalent as in other majorcolleges, we-still expect results when
“you got the ponies.”

And, this autumn, it seems that Dawson “has the ponies.” For
one thing, after two years of the straight T formation and some minor
variations, he has installed the offense which clicked so well for him
at Michigan State. ‘

Secondly, for the ﬁrst time in many eons, Pitt has retained 86%
of their freshmen team. Previously, as low as only 30% of the frosh
remained for a third semester. The sophs, besides being back, almost
intact, are rated one of the best squads to join the varsity.

Thirdly, there are 25 tlettermen on the squad with 15 of them
linemen. While experience may be lacking with the sophs, it’s not
with these men and at present only three sophomores are slated
for the ﬁrst string.

Now to the opposite side. As usual, the Blue and Gold as the
toughest schedule in the nation but this isn’t any secret and it’s the
only way to get a high ranking.‘

Playing six patsies and two or three major schools a year may
result in a glittering won and lost record but it doesn’t produce pres-
tige or a bowl bid.

Other factors may be on this side but the schedule is the
one that counts. Last year Dawson said after the ﬁrst four games,
“The pressure’s been on the boys in all four games and I don’t
know how long __they’ll be able to keep it up.” Well, if they had
to be “up” for all the games last time out, what about this year?

The answer will come slowly, approximately once every week-
end starting with this Friday night.
