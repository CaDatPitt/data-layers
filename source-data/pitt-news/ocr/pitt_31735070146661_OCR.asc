Some classes
canceled

Thomas Smith
For The Pitt News

Many Pitt students found holes in
their summer class schedules in
early May after a string of class
cancellations by various depart-
ment chairs.

Sam Conte, the University
registrar, said students were
notiﬁed of their class cancella-
tions through e-mail in the past
several weeks.

The Office of the Registrar
handles registration, enrollment
and academic records for all of
the students on Pitt’s campus.

, “If a class is canceled, any stu-
dents who may be registered for
that class will receive an e-mail
message the next day,” Conte said
in an e—mail. “You would have to
check with the Student Account-
ing Office and the Bookstore re-
garding refund policy.” .

Medical marijuana bill in state le
Bill would allow doctors in Pennsylvania to prescribe marijuana for certain uses

1 cal marijuana in that state Tues-

John Manganaro
Assistant News Editor

One state senator wants to bring
a new kind of green innovation
to Pennsylvania — medical mari-
juana reform. _

Sen. Daylin Leach’s new legis-
lation, officially known as Sen-
ate Bill 1350, would allow people
with some medical conditions
to apply for a registry identiﬁ-
cation card that would permit
them to possess up to an ounce
of marijuana.

Appropriate conditions for
medical marijuana use include
cancer, multiple sclerosis and
epilepsy, according to the bill.

Marijuana would be taxed and

‘distributed at “Compassion Cen-
ters” run by the state Department ,

of Health. Card holders could
also grow their own marijuana
— up to six plants at a time.

“For too long, people have
been denied marijuana as a le-
gitimate and_ compassionate
treatment for disease,” Leach,
D-Montgomery, said. "‘If we can
prescribe morphine and Oxycon-
tin safely, then we should be able
to prescribe marijuana.”

Leach sees the bill as an issue
that transcends partisanship. A
number of historically red states
with populations similar to Penn-
sylvania have passed medical
marijuana laws, he said.

“Both Democrats and Repub-
licans can get cancer,” Leach

said. “People who are desper-
ately sick ar9n’t looking to get
high. They’re looking to get bet-
ter. That’s why we’re also calling
the bill the Compassionate Use
Medical Marijuana Act.” V

The bill has yet to see signifi-
cant support or opposition from
within ‘the legislature, Leach
said, because no hearings have
been held on the subject. V

Despite Leach’s enthusiasm,
many in the medical community
of Pennsylvania and other states
are not enthused about the no-
tion of medical marijuana, in-
cluding Dr. Terry McWilliams,
vice president of Medical Affairs
at Newport Hospital in Rhode
Island.

He discussed the use of medi-

day morning.

“While [Rhode Island] has
laws permitting the use of medi-
cal marijuana, I don’t know of
any doctors in Newport or the
surrounding area who actually
prescribe it,”_ Mcwilliams said.
“I’m not an expert on the topic,
but I know that medical_mari—
juana use is not widespread.”

Mcwilliams, a Pitt alumnus,
said marijuana can work as an
effective alternative to some de-
generative or harmful prescrip-
tion painkillers currently on the
market, particularly when such
painkillers can lead to nerve
damage after sustained use.

“My understanding is that
marijuana can be an effective

gislature

alternative to a lot of the pain
killers given to- cancer patients
and others,” McWilliams said.
“I’ve looked at the issue with
interest, to see if it could apply
to our hospital, but we decided
not to incorporate marijuana into
our care plan in the near future.
At this point we don’t need it to
properly treat patients.”

.It is yet unclear what path
the bill might take in the com-
ing months, but if the myriad
research conducted in both the
public and private sectors over
the last year serve as any indica-
tion, medical marijuana might
soon become reality in Pennsyl-
vania. ‘ "

Sodexo, union tensions aren’t over

I Michael Macagnone
Assistant News Editor

The disputes between Sodexo and its
employees at Pitt are not over.

Sodexo, an international corpo-
ration that operates dining services
on Pitt’s campus, and the Service
Employees International Union Lo-
cal 32Bj have been in conﬂict over
two different issues. The ﬁrst is a set
of stalled contract negotiations for
about 200 workers on Pitt’s campus
represented by the union. The sec-
ond is a set of allegations of unfair
labor practices by Sodexo that the
SEIU ﬁled with the National Labor
Relations Board.

The Service Employees Inter-
national Union is an organization
that represents more than 2 million
employees in North America.

SEIU Local 32B] represents
more than 5,000 workers in West-
ern Pennsylvania, according to its
website.Since March, Pitt’s stance,
related by spokesman John Fedele,
has been one of noninvolvement.

“It’s an issue between Sodexo
and the union,” Fedele said of the
disputes.

Other universities around the «

country have experienced similar
disagreements between Sodexo and
its employees. This year SEIU mem-
bers have staged protests against
Sodexo at George Mason University
in Washington, D.C., and Ohio State
University.

The SEIU launched a website,
cleanupsodexo.org, that details a
series of allegations on various col-
lege campuses.

A series of labor disputes at the
University of California Davis carn-
pus in 2007 resulted in the university
hiring the Sodexo employees, with
the corporation continuing to run
dining services. _-

Negotiations with Sodexo for a
new contract began in mid-February,
about six weeks before an extension

on the last contract ended, said So-
dexo spokeswoman Monica Zimmer.‘
The unionized workers have been
workingwithoutacontract since the
end of March, and Regional Director
Gabe Morgan said that the workers
have continued to work under the
terms of the old contract.

The SEIU workers at Pitt have
assured jobs inthe fall, Morgan said,_
but the negotiations may still take
months. -

Morgan said that all communi-
cation with Sodexo and the union
now goes through a third party fed-
eral mediator. These mediators are
employed by the Federal Mediation
and Conciliation Service, an agency
that helps conduct negotiations be- .
tween employees and management,
according to the agency’s website.

SEIU spokesman Matt Painter
said that the next round of nego-
tiations, with the federal mediator
present, will take place on May 19.

Sodexo’s most recent offer to
the union included a 90 cent pay
raise over the next three years, an
increase in medical coverage and
lowered insurance premiums during
the school year.

Under Sodexo’s offered contract,
Painter said new employees would
be required to pay 30 percent of their
health coverage, instead of the 10
percent new employees are now re-
quired to pay.

Painter said that the goal of the
negotiations would be to get a “fair
wage” for workers and affordable
health care coverage.

Zimmer said that Sodexo would
try and reach an agreement that
would be “fair to all parties.”

The union voted to strike after
negotiations failed in April, the ﬁrst
time SEIU workers on Pitt’s campus
have gone on strike since 1970.

Protesting employees formed
a line on Forbes Avenue outside of
Litchﬁeld Towers on April 26 — the
ﬁrst day of Pitt’s ﬁnals week. The
strike ended April 28 when the union

and Sodexo agreed to return to ne-
gotiations after protesters blocked
Forbes Avenue for almost 10 min-
utes.

In mid—March, members of SEIIJ '

and nonunionized workers alleged
unfair practices by Sodexo’s manage-
ment that tried to prevent employees
from joininga union. More than 100
Sodexo employees at Pitt are not rep-
resented by a union. .
Students formed a new advoca

group, Students in Solidarity, with I

Sodexo workers that tried to advo-
cate on the workers behalf. Students
tabled in Towers lobby about So-
dexo’s alleged unfair labor practices

_and participated a protest in Market

Central with SEIU members. ‘ — .
The union then went on to ﬁle a
formal complaint with the National

Labor Relations Board, a federal

agency that investigates allegations
of unfair labor practices and holds
elections to determine if workers
wantto formaunion. The complaint,
ﬁled on March 24, alleges coercive
statements and interrogation by
Sodexo management, trying to dis-
courage its employees fromjoining
a union.

NLRB Regional Director Robert
Chester said that investigations into
unfair labor practices usually take
about six weeks. The investigation
will be complete by the middle of

- May, Chester said.

The result of the investigation
can range from a dismissed case or
an out—of-court settlement to a trial.
Chester said that less than 5 percent
of cases go to trial. The majority of
cases will either be settled out of
court or the NLRB will drop the al-
legations. -

Zimmer said that SEIU has ﬁled
multiple complaints against So-
dexo in the past. She said Sodexo
was aware of 14 complaints out of

6,000 sites Sodexo manages, and

that none resulted in charges or out-
of-court settlements.

rized the use of marijuana for
medicinal purposes. .

The latest poll, released in
early April by the Pew Research
Center for the People 8: the Press,
found that nearly three quarters
of Americans responded posi-
tively to the idea of their state
allowing the sale and use of mari-
juana for medical purposes.

What really puts gray hairs
on reform advocates’ heads, ac-
cording to medical marijuana
advocate Allen St. Pierre, is that
44 percent of Americans support
the notion of marijuana legaliza-
tion. . . .-

St. Pierre is the executive di-
rector of the ‘National Organi-
zation for the Reform of Mari-
juana Laws. He discussed the

new legislation during a phone
interview. .

“Tliere are currently over
120 million Americans living in
the 14 states where Cannabis is
decriminalized,” St. Pierre-said.
“There are also about 90 mil-
lion who live in areas with some
typeof medical marijuana law. If
these laws were detrimental to
society’s health ‘in the way our
opposition‘ claims, we would be
able to see" it quite clearly.”

Of course, there are still a
number of public concerns about
loosening-marijuana regulations,
St. Pierre said.

According to the Pew Re-
search Center poll, 45 percent

of Americans say they would be ~

often get canceled, Conte said.

The fact is, every college and
university, Pitt included, has to
cancel classes every semester,
not just during summer, he said.
They also add classes every se-
mester.

“Approximately 45 classes
have been canceled,” Conte
said.

Conte said summer registra-
tion numbers for this summer
are comparable to the same time
last summer. .

He also said there is not a
website that lists all canceled
classes, and there is no'way to
know in advance which classes
are in danger of cancellation.

There are many reasons a
class can be canceled, including
lack of student interest, budget-
ary reasons and lack of a suitable
instructor, Conte said.

The ultimate decision, he said,
lies with each individual depart-
ment’s dean’s office.

So if a student was really de-
pending on a class that was can-
celed, he or she might try going
to the chair’s office to see if there
was anything the student could
do. to change the chair’s mind,
Conte said.

Students can be proactive in
the scheduling process for future
summer sessions and can moni-
tor the number of open seats for
a class through their my.pitt.
edu account. They can_also call
the dean’s office with questions
about enrollment numbers.

But the news is not all bad for
students with canceled classes.

John Burns, the Book Center’s
textbook manager, said students
can receive refunds for books
they purchased for canceled
classes — as long as they can
show a receipt and proof that
the class was canceled.

' “compassion center” opened near their

home.

Despite these consternations, just 26
percent of Americans say marijuana re-
form is something that seriously concerns
them, St. Pierre said.

These concerns are highest among
those who openly criticize medical mari-
juana, but are no higher or lower in states
that already allow marijuana for medical
purposes.

“The numbers make one thing pretty
clear, if you’re a federal politician and you

don’t support marijuana reform legisla-
tion, you’re pretty much a chump,” St.
Pierre said.

“If medical marijuana was a candi-
date anywhere but the most conserva-
tive Pennsylvania districts, it would win.”
St. Pierre said. “It is more popular right
now statewide than any of the Democratic
gubernatorial candidates, and it’s even
more popular among Republicans than
Attorney General Tom Corbett.”

Hooked after one whiff?

bout a year after it introduced a

chocolate aerosol, a company called

Le Whif has released a breathable
coffee spray, delivering the caffeine
equivalent of an espresso, without that
pesky cup.

The product was designed by Harvard
professor David Edwards. Each Le Whif tube
contains ﬂavor particles small enough to
orally inhale through a lipstick size aerosol
tube. But the particles are big enough that

they won’t dangerously enter into the -

lungs.
The chocolate Le Whif was created to

allow for the taste of chocolate without ,

the calories (each tube contains less than
one calorie), and the coffee Le Whif was
designed to provide a hit of caffeine, inhaled
through the mouth, without the hassle of
standing in line at Starbucks, or you know,
swallowing.

As with anything that offers this sort of
quick gratiﬁcation, we have to wonder if

people will become addicted to this as they
do to nearly all other caffeinated substances,
especially with the product being sold at
candy stores and coffee shops. I
‘Additionally, this method seems to take
some of the enjoyment out of the coffee
experience, replacing it instead with a
means of getting as much caffeine with as

' little time and effort as possible. After all,

some consumers don’t choose coffee just for
itscaffeine value. Coffee consumption has
its own culture. Despite the convenience
of directly inhaling caffeine, consumers
lose ﬂavor variety, aroma and texture that

. regular coffee offers, making aerosol coffee

a largerthreat to Red Bull or 5-Hour Energy
Shots than coffeehouses.

Nonetheless, Le Whif coffee inhalers
could be a better alternative to energy
drinks, as far as sugar and calories are
concerned. The small biodegradable tube
is also a nice alternative to the paper waste
created by‘ disposable coffee cups.

Go ahead, takethat call

ell phone users couldbe offthe hook. The
Federal Communications Commission
aid this week that it was considering

a plan to reduce high cell phone bills, The New

York Times reported.
Wirelessphone companies wouldberequired

. to let customers know if they’re using too many

minutes orexceedingtexiinglimits, amongother
potentialhighcharges, before they’re struckwith
asoaringbill atthe end of the month. .

In an ideal world, cell phone users —— prac1:i—
cally everyone these days -— would be respon-
sible and remember the limits of their phone
contracts. In reality, tweens hammer out text
messages to no end, and clingy mothers can’t
resist callingtheir kids at college every ﬁve min-
utes.

For customers, it’s one less surprise expense .

p to worry about and one more way to save mon-

ey in a tough economy. And for the 12-year-old
kid receiving his ﬁrst phone, this policy could

help him make sure that whoever’s paying his

bill doesn’t take away his phone after the ﬁrst
month. ,

Thesewarningswouldn‘tjustbeneﬁtthecare-

It’s baseball season, and isn’t that excit-
ing? We couldn’t wait and neither could
you. We’ve loved our Pittsburgh Pirates
for as long as we’ve been able to love, and
like most of our girlfriends, they’ve let us
down in so many marvelous, unexpected
ways. '

Thanks to baseball’s unfair revenue
structure and Bob Nutting’s legendary fru-
gality, the Pirates appear unlikely to have
another winning season. They haven’t had
one since 1992, and a few local sports-
writers were bold enough to argue that
Andy Van Slyke was a better player than
Barry Bonds. After that came 17 years of
rebuilding, during which the Pirates have

rates: -hard—vvorking losers

become the most rebuilt team.

It’s hard to argue with the results of
this project. Most teams rebuild to im-
prove, something that never made sense
to us. Once a teantimproves, it has to stop
rebuilding —— no more reclamation proj-
ects, high draft picks, anemic attendance
ﬁgures, losing seasons and devil—may-care
trades.

It takes a lot of work to stay this me-
diocre. Ask the general managers of the
Oakland Golden State Warriors, Detroit
Lions or the Columbus Blue Jackets. You
need to make the wrong decisions at the
right times over and over again to stay out

' of contention.

Fortunately for the Pirates, they’re
not operating in an environment where
a salary cap leads to parity and occasional
winning seasons even for the worst-run

Arizona immigration law un-American, authoritarian

Border violence is a higher priority than immigration issues

 
    
 

Steve Kaszycki
Columnist

The Support Our Law Enforcement
and Safe Neighborhoods Act, signed
by Arizona Gov._]an Brewer and de-
signed to “identify, prosecute and
deport illegal immigrants,” has been
defended as a valuable tool for law
enforcement of a border state.
The law is, in fact, an irrespon-
sible and improper use of govern-
mental power that people of all po-
litical afﬁliations ought to oppose.
Despite the fact that the primary
justiﬁcation for the Arizona bill was
the supposedly extreme condition
facing the border state, State Reps.
Daryl Metcalfe (R—Cranberry) and
Harry Readshaw (D-Allegheny)
have decided to push for a similar
bill in Pennsylvania. Without that
pallid justiﬁcation, the only thing
we’re left with is the same old “we
don’t like immigrants” rhetoric.
’ Among its provisions, the Ari-
zona law requires immigrants to
carry their immigration papers at
all times and mandates that police
officers question anyone who is
suspected of being an illegal immi-
grant. Additionally, the law targets

those who knowingly employ illegal
immigrants.

_The law would invariably re-
sult in the targeting of Hispanics,
both immigrants and natural born
citizens, as the notion of someone
being “suspected” of being an il-
legal immigrant is a natural invi-
tation for the type of pre—emptive
racial proﬁling that is distinctly
un-American.

Demandingto see peoples’ pa- ‘

pers, assuming illegality on the
basis of ethnicity and endorsing
night raids aimed at ethnic neigh-
borhoods is not American. What
it does bring to mind need not be
said.

Moreover, the law does not solve
the real problem around the border
— gangs. L

Instead, it diverts attention and
capital away from legitimate and
reasonable efforts to disrupt violent
groups engaged in drug smuggling
and other illicit activities, concen-
trating them instead on disrupting
the lives of migrant workers.

For example, immigration en-
forcement would become a top pri-

ority for law enforcement oflicials V

over other crimes, because agencies
risk being sued for not complying
with the immigration law, according

to The Arizona Republic, a newspa-
per based in Phoenix, Az. The law
enforcement and border control
are ﬁnite resources and should be
optimized by concentrating them in
areas that are truly important. R
Anti-immigrant movements
have always existed in response to

signiﬁcant migrations in America '

and elsewhere. The Chinese Exclu-
sion Act of 1882 effectively froze
Chinese immigration for decades
after Chinese immigrants were
blamed for white unemployment
etc. This was one example of the
government responding to racist
and nativist sentiments with em-
barrassing, reactionary legislation
that interfered with the market and
conferred a de-jure otherness to a
subset of people. .
Arizona would be wiser to con-
centrate on disrupting border gangs
rather than the lives of hard-work-
ing labor migrants. ' .
Beyond its broadly misguided

goals of interfering in natural mi-
gratory ﬂows, the .law is speciﬁcally
and seriously ﬂawed. The merits of
requiring individuals to carry im-
migration documents is dubious
at best, as many politicians recog-
nized.‘ While other countries, such
as France, have laws that permit

such police maneuvers, the United
States’ Bill of Rights was established
as a means of protecting residents
from an invasive government. Con-
servatives objected to the notion of
the government demanding under
threat of legal punishment that they

purchase a product (health care). '

It is only consistent to oppose the
notion of government being able
to demand people’s residency pa-
pers.

The liberals’ opposition to the
law is natural. common sense, tra-

- ditional liberal rhetoric concern-

ing laws often revolves around the
notion of fairness or empathy, as
President Obama illustrated when

_ discussing the criteria for his selec-

tion of a Supreme Court justice.
But conservatives should also
oppose the bill on principle. While a
popular conservative frame is “law
and order,” conservatives ought to
realize that this only should extend

to laws which are sensible —— the ex— —

istence of a law is not an ipso-facto
justiﬁcation of its implementation.
We have many laws which are not
sensible and rarely enforced — for
instance, laws against unlicensed
cab drivers. A ‘
Some conservatives believe that
enforcement of immigration laws

are justified, but they do not real- i

ize that the very presence of illegal
immigrants in the labor force is an
illustration that the government has
interfered in the labor market to the
extent that itrequires circumvent-
ing the legal process. Without the
illegal workforce, the labor market
would shrink up to 3 to 4 percent
and the economy would diminish
in turn. I; “ R
Conservatives who champion
free markets and extol Ronald Rea-
gan’s famous quip. that government
is the problem and not the solution

should reject the notion that the .

government should play an active
part in contorting the labor mar.-
ket to favor people who happen to

have been born here. This is not the ,

government’s role. Conservatives
should realize that the proposi-
tion of having a government that
concerns itself with dictating the
culture and the ethnic makeup of
the country runs counter to the

long—standing tradition —— though .

not always" reality — of America

as a country welcoming of immi-

grants.

hasn’t signed a single has-been
player along the lines of Derek
“Operation Shutdown” Bell or
Jeromy Burnitz, nor wasted the
best years of a mid-level star’s
career. In fact, he traded most

of the Pirates’ aging and slightly
overpaid players so that the team
could ﬁnally field the squad of
minor leaguers that our fair city
deserves.

But I don’t think Huntington
went far enough. He traded es-
tablished players like Freddy San-
chez andjack Wilson for organi-
zational depth, but he shouldn’t
have stopped there. He should
have traded the decent players
the Pirates have in the minors,
like Pedro Alvarez, for even more
minor leaguers.

Using this sort of plan, two
players could be turned into
four, four into eight, eight into
16. Eventually the Pirates would
accumulate hundreds of players,
none of whom are any good, and

then they would be set for de- .

cades of rebuilding.

If one or two of these players
panned out, they could be trad-
ed immediately for additional
depth. One of the things that a

t rebuilding team needs is depth —

and lots of it. A rebuilding team
doesn’t need a transitional star
or anyone else,who could serve
as the face of the franchise. The
players on the front of the pro-
gram should be unrecognizable
to fans who don’t read “Baseball
America.”

The Pirates have shown a will-
ingness to rebuild at all costs,
by which we mean as few costs
as possible.

If they’re always rebuild-
ing, they don’t have to spend
that much — why bother lur-
ing 10,000 fans to a game when
5,000 will suffice to support their
comparatively meek payroll?

Their reputation for rebuild-
ing is unexcelled among all the
teams of Major League Baseball
and will be until they have a win-
ning season’. Fans should be hon-
ored to watch Delwyn Young and

Andy LaRoche in their primes,’

because few teams besides the

Kansas City Royals would ever I

give these guys so much playing
time.

It will soon be the 20th an-
niversary of the Pirates’ losing
streak. They’re always nowhere
near having a winning season. Yet
on each successive opening day
we fans can entertain thoughts
that they might have one, and of
course, they won’t. Baseball is a
beautiful game

Violence in the movie in

Critics question how much blood and gore is too much in ﬁlms M .

Andy Tybout
Assistant A 8: E Editor

We Americans live in relative
peace, but sometimes walking into
a theater -—— particularly one play-
ing movies like “Kick—Ass” — can
seem like entering a war zone.

It’s an oft—heard complaint
that movie violence has become
increasingly pervasive and graphic
in recent years (see “The Human
Centipede”), ﬂooding the screen
with carnage that is often carried
out in the name of justice.

The latest affront to decency
seems to be the former ﬁlm, which
features, among other gory gim-
micks, an 11-year-old named Hit
Girl who dispenses justice by way
of knives and bullets.

Even worse, the ﬁlm seems.to

lack any context with which to jus- _
tify the insanity, from my impres-
_ sions of it. ' '

Inevitably, critics like Roger
Ebert took issue with Hit Girl’s

antics.
In a scathing one-star review of

the ﬁlm, Ebert begins by asking, .

“Shall I have feelings, or should I
pretend to be cool?” He continues
to condemn the ﬁlm as “morally
reprehensible,” enraged that an
11-year-old pulls the trigger.

Ebert and others’ criticisms
sent the stars scrambling.

Director Matthew Vaughn
sought to trivialize the carnage as
“‘Tom andjerry’ violence,” and Ni-
colas Cage went as far as to defend
Hit Girl as “a pop icon of [feminist]
strengt .”

If the box office is any indica-
tion, this justiﬁcation didn’t help.

The ﬁlm fell to No. 5 after only a .

week.
Feminist undertones aside,

there’s no doubt that “Kick-Ass,”'

endorses violence, at least in its
own world — as do hundreds of
other recent ﬁlms.

Discarding, for a moment, the
issue of an 11-year-old as a vigilante
—— really, would she be any worse

an inﬂuence on children than other
action heroes? —— it seems perti-
nent, at this juncture in cinema,
to ask if ﬁlmic celebrations of vio-
lence can ever be justiﬁed.

My answer: It depends on a
ﬁlm’s end.

Even if a movie approaches vio-
lence from an “excitement” angle

— if it makes viewers clap, rather-

than cringe — it can redeem the
audience’s bloodlust by relating to
a point that’s more mature than a
simple endorsement of force.

Take last year’s “Inglourious
Basterds” for example.

Quentin Tarantino’s latest ﬁlm
ﬁnds his characters at their most
depraved — scalping Nazis, carv-
ing swastikas into foreheads, plot-
ting to burn one another alive — all
to an encouraging soundtrack.

Yet for all the stylized blood-
shed for which Tarantino is no-
torious, “Basterds” manages to

embed the carnage within a clever,

postmodern play on the Western
genre -— and, depending on how

seriously you take it, a fascinating
parable of revenge.

True, some might take the
carnage of “Basterds” as a simple
sanction of brutality. But such po-
tential misreads shouldn’t discred-
it a ﬁlm. A director can’t control
whether an audience perceives an
intellectual portrayal of violence as
simply “awesome.” _

With “Kick-Ass,” on the other
hand, awesomeness is the sole
intent. There’s purposeﬁilly little
to elevate an audience’s thoughts
beyond a simple “Hell yeah” or
“Holy sh*t. He just got blown out
of a window by a rocket.”

It’s just vioience for the sake of
violence — pure bloody conquest.
In this case, it would be hard to
argue the violence is somehow re-
deeming. It simply furthers our de-
sensitization, albeit with enjoyable
effects and lovable characters.

A So to return to the brunt of this
debate, is “Kick-Ass” a great evil,
as Ebert as suggested?

No. But is it a little one? Prob-

dustry stirs up debate and outrage

ably. I would put it on par with a
cigarette. It has no wholesome
qualities, but you should be al-
lowed to partake in it at your own
risk. The alternative —— censor-
ing certain ﬁlms for unwholesome
content — would inevitably lead
to unwarranted intrusions on truly
artistic endeavors.

For the sake of the great art,
pulp must pass unﬁltered into the
theater.

But that isn’t to say everyone
should go see these movies.

As a citizen of a (mostly) cen-
sor—less ﬁlm market, you have
to be sure you’re stable enough
— perhaps smart enough + to

‘ separate the cartoonish bloodshed

onscreen with the tragic, irrevers-
ible horrors of real life. If you can
do that, then, if you must, have
your fun.

So to answer Ebert’s query, yes,
you should have feelings when
watching movies like “Kick-Ass.”
That means at least you haven’t
been numbed.

‘Iron Man 27 impresses fans

Sequel is worthy, though‘ unextraordinary

Larissa Gula
Staff’ Writer

*“Iron' Man 2”: I ‘

Starring: Robert DowneyJr., Don Chea-
dle, Mickey Rourke

Director: Jon Favreau

Studio: Marvel Studios/Fairview En-
tertainrnent

Grade: B

Nothing says summer has arrived like
the release of “Iron Man 2,” and if this is
any indication as to how the best months
of 2010 will play out, we’re in for a wild
ride. :

First, the plot: “Iron Man 2” opens with R

a ﬂashback to the first ﬁlm’s surprise end—
ing, in which Tony Stark (Robert Downey
Jr.) reveals that he is Iron Man.

Now, six months later, Stark has seem-
ingly found the key to world peace. Be-

cause he is —- or at least believed to be —
the only person with the ability to create
the Iron Man technology and suits, no one

"even tries to match him in a ﬁght.

Demonstrating his typical ﬂamboy-
ance, Stark heaps credit upon himself for
ending global conﬂict, promising never
to share his suits or technology with any-
one.

But behind the smiles and the ﬂash,
Stark is in trouble — the very device
keeping him alive and powering his suit
is poisoning him. ' ’

Also, there’s a ﬁerce old Russian (Mick-
ey Rourke) emerging with one purpose
in mind: get revenge on Tony Stark for
his father.

Soon, Stark ﬁnds himself battling
friends, enemies and his’ failing condi-
tion — warding off both supervillains and
the military’s constant attempts to steal
his technology.

Sequelsuccess

‘Iron Man’ is solid
Iron Man 4 8

But enough about the plot. “Iron Man
2” is, after all, an action ﬁlm, which means
that only the action should impress —
and it does.

Although “Iron Man 2” isn’t quite an-

other “Dark Knight,” the impeccable ﬁght A

sequences keep viewers satiated. _.
Some of the gadgets Stark created in

the ﬁrst ﬁlm have been reinvented, and

some new toys have been added. They’re

flashy, they’re powerful and they’re fun

to watch in action, particularly on the
big screen.

Of course, the actors bring their own
enjoyment. ' V .

Downey]r., for his part, plays his char-
acter in a similar fashion to the ﬁrst ﬁlm
-—‘walking a fine line between lovable
overconﬁdence and insufferable arro-
gance.

In other words, even when there isn’t a
large explosion or a shiny suit to admire,
nothing falls sliort. When there aren’t gun
battles and ﬁst ﬁghts, there are lively back-
and-forth quips—- usually concerning the
fate of the Iron Man technology.

Of course, the ultimate question with a —

sequel is whether it surpasses or betrays
its big screen predecessor.

Well, “Iron Man 2” by no means sur-
passes the first, but it’s certainly worth
watching on the big screen.

Pitt not offered
Big Ten bid

Radio station reports only 4 teams asked

Alex Oltmanns
Sports Editor

After months of rumors indi-
cating that Pitt could join the
Big Ten, a Kansas City radio
station is reporting that the
conference made offers to
four schools, none of which
’ are Pitt.
The station, Sports Radio

810 WHB, reported that cur— '

rent Big 12 schools Nebraska
‘and Missouri were offered
spots in the Big Ten, along with
Rutgers out of the Big East and
Notre Dame, an independent
football program.

Notre Dame said all along
that it has no interest in join-
ing the league.

Currently an 11-team league,

5 the Big Ten was rumored to
_ possibly. expand to either 14

or 16 teams.

If Notre Dame does decline
the invitation, Rutgers would
be the 14th team, and the Big
Ten would then.decide whether
to stay at 14 teams or add two
more, WHB reported.

But if Notre Dame accepts,
sources say the league would
pursue one additional school,
the station reported.‘

No official announcement
can be made until league of-
ﬁcials get the chance to meet
in early June.

Big Ten Associate Commis-
sioner Scott Chipman said the
league has no comment on the
matter, beyond those it made
in December when it said it
would expand within 12 to 18
months.

Pitt ofﬁcials were not avail-
able for comment.

Pitt’s softball team only managed
one victory in its three-game se-
ries with Rutgers this weekend. As
it turns out, that’s all the Panthers

 needed to clinch a berth i_n the Big
East Championship.

The single victory over the
Scarlet Knights was Pitt’s 10th
conference victory, and it boosted
the Panthers into the postseason.

, Pitt ﬁnished sixth in the Big East,
and the top eight teams advance
to the championship.

Pitt’s No. 6 seed is its highest
seed in the Big East Championship.
It’s the Panthers’_ fourth berth in
ﬁve years and the ﬁrst for second-

' year coach Holly Aprile.

“It’s a big deal for us,” Aprile

said. “I told the girls that once we

get there, anything can happen.”

Pitt will face No. 3 seed Lou-

sively.”

After the ﬁrst game, Aprile
said, the Panthers played “un-
inspired,” although she said the
team members were unaware that
they clinched a spot in the cham-
pionship with the ﬁrst win.

In the second game, the score
reversed, with Rutgers defeating
Pitt 2-1.

Pitt player Ashley Amistade
started the game with a single,
stole second and then advanced
to third on a Holly Stevens line out
to right ﬁeld. Amistade then stole
home to score Pitt’s ﬁrst and ﬁnal
run of the game.

“We got runners on, but we

failed to execute,” Aprile said. “We

couldn’t move therunners over.”

Rutgers answered in the bot-
tom of the ﬁrst, when Mandy Craig
scored Jen Meinheit with a single
to right-center ﬁeld. In the ﬁfth
inning, Meinheit brought in the
winning run with a single.

In the third game of the week-
end, the Scarlet Knights won 7-1.

Pitcher Berliner struggled in
the ﬁrst inning, and Rutgers got an
early four-run lead. Craig brought
in Meinheit with a ﬁelder’s choice

_to ﬁrst base. Then, Rutgers’

Mikelyn Messina hit a three-run
homerun to center ﬁeld.

“We never really Fecovered
from that,” Aprile said.

The Scarlet Knights added to.‘

their total in the second inning.
Lindley brought in Meinheit
with a double to center ﬁeld, and
then Lindley scored off a Craig
double.

Pitt qualiﬁes for Big East Tournament as 6th seed

Pitt scored its only run in the
fourth inning, when Yvette Bra-
vo hit her third homerun of the
season to left ﬁeld. The Panthers
struggled offensively because they

failed to make adjustments at the ‘

plate, Aprile said.

In the bottom of the fourth,
Rutgers scored again, when Lind-
ley brought in Meinheit with a
single to the right side.

As the Panthers head into the
Big East Championship, Aprile
said she wants to see the same ac-
tions she has expected from her

‘ team all season.

“I want maximum effort,” she
said. “ I want to swing the bats and
be aggressive at the plate.

“I don’t want them to be intimi-
dated,” she said. “Come out and
play hard.”

TRACK AND FIELD

 

Pitt sends 30 to Princeton

The teams prep to compete against 90 schools in NJ.’

Tonyjovenitti
Assistant Sports Editor

The Panthers will compete in two
of the most anticipated meets
in collegiate track and ﬁeld this
weekend. The men’s and women’s
teams will have their last chance
to make a push for the NCAA Re-
gional Championships.

Pitt will send 15 men ‘ ‘
and 15 women to Prince-
ton, N._]., this weekend to
compete against athletes
from 90 other schools
along the East Coast. The
two teams will compete
in what is essentially the
same meet, but the men
will compete in what is
known as the Intercolle-

. giate Association of Ama-

teur Athletes of America
championships (the IC4A), while
the women will take part in the

.~., Eastern Collegiate Athletic Con-

ference championships. ,

Coach Alonzo Webb said he has
highhopes for several athletes to
earn points for Pitt. '

“We. have to have a great show- V

ing tliis weekend to make it to the
regional championships,” Webb
said. V ' T

“[Leonard] is a-"special player

took the ﬁrst contest 14-2, while
the Pirates won the second 9-7.
Jordano said the structure of

. the Seton Hall ﬁeld played a role

in the outcomes of Saturday’s
games.

“Seton Hall’s ballpark is huge
and possibly the biggest and deep-
est ﬁeld I have ever been on,”_]or-
dano said. “We hit some balls very
hard and deep, but there were wind
gusts up to 40 mph, making it a
tough day for both teams.”

In the Pitt win, sophomore
Matt Iannazzo secured the victory,
pitching seven innings and giving
up only two runs.

The Panthers jumped out to a

~ lead early in the game by scoring

ﬁve rims in the ﬁrst inning, two off

i junior Kevan Smith’s homerun.

In the fourth inning, the Pan-
thers had four additional runs,
making the score 9-0. The Pirates
were able to avoid the shutout with
runs in the fourth and ﬁlth innings,
but the game was well in hand by
that point.

The second half of the double-
header began similarly. The Pitt

offense jumped to a 3-0 lead in the
second inning.

But the Pirates’ attempt at a
comeback succeeded in this con-
test, and the team scored ﬁve runs
on ﬁve hits in the second inning
and had four more in the third.

All nine runs, and the loss, were
charged to senior pitcher Nathan
Hood, whereas the win went to
Seton Hall’s Jon Prosinski.

“Prosinski did a solid job for
Seton Hall,”_]ordano said. “We got
behind early in the second and
third innings, and Prosinski was
able to keep us off balance.”

Seton Hall’s closing pitcher
Benny Mejia ensured the Pirate
victory with two innings of score-
less work.

The Panthers have nine games
remaining in the season before the
Big East conference tournament,
butjordano emphasizes the impor-
tance of focus in the ﬁnal stretch.

“Nothing changes, even with the
tournament appearance clinched,”

Jordano said. “We prepare and ex-
ecute each game as it comes, and
we will continue to do so.”
