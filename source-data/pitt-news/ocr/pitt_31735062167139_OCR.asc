the following statement: “Pm

crowd. Dr. Posvar "waited for

“We understand,” he said, “that

rupted by a statement from the
midst of the crowd. “The second

then silent audience. ,

The Chancellor, keeping cool,
smiled and waited for the cheers
and jeers to subside, and contin-
ued. “This is a hot spring night.

‘We all wanted to get out and we

did,” he said. “And any students
that were un'lawfully protected

from the crowd halted his talk).

Dr. Posvar then said, “I’m go-
ing to go down and talk to the
authorities right now and see
that no one is treated unfairly. If
there has been any unfair treat-
ment or brutality, we’ll' see that
these conditions are rectified.”
Cheers from the crowd, cramped
within the Towers lobby, greeted
this remark.

“We have asked that all the
city policemen leave the Univers-
ity property,” Dr. Posvar stated,
and after the cheers- he added,
“they have left or‘ are leaving the
University property.”

After surveying the crowd, Dr.
Posvar said, “It’s hot in here.
Could we .” A resounding
“No” arose from the crowd. The
Chancellor went on: “Let’s go out
on the patio and discuss things
like McCarthy versus Kennedy.”
When a deafening roar of “boos”
died down, the crowd began
chanting, “We Want Posvar.”

Grinning, Dr. Posvar continued.

they, too, were “turned on.”

The crowd became quiet, and

27 Students Detained
by Pittsburgh Officers

by HOBART HARRIS

The University’s second Spring demonstation started
out when a group of hip students, sitting on the Towers
Porch and strumming their guitars, were bombarded from
the windows of Tower B and Holland Hall with Water
bombs, toilet paper, and anything else students could
throw. Sensing the beginning of something good, students

began to mill around the Towers porch. T
When the crowd was large enough, someone yelled “We want
silk,” and the crowd was off, down the stairs, and into the Quad-
rangle. Then girls, from open dorm windows, showered the crowd
with more silk than has appeared in the Quad in years, and fire was

ignited.

‘During the first 11/2 hours of the demonstration, only the Uni-
versity police were present. They urged the students to keep off the
street. "The students surged onto Fifth Avenue, however, blocking
40 yards of the street, and they tied up traffic. Then after fifteen
minutes, the students straggled back into the Quad.

At this point the city police
appeared. They attempted to
clear the street by riding their
vehicles at the crowd. They
forced the crowd onto the side-
walk. The crowd remained in
the Quad for about 15 minutes,
and then again the students be-
gan to surge towards Fifth
Avenue. This time, the police
met them with clubs and dogs.
About a dozen police officers
then charged the crow d and
grabbed students, clubbing
many. In at least one instance,
a student was clubbed after he
had been grabbed, and, while
he was "being loaded on a po-
lice van.

This action seemed to anger
the students, especially since
students were arrested indis-
criminately.

At this point,
had two major complaints
against the Police; these rea-
sons to a large degree incited
the demonstrators even more
The students first gripe was the
use of force displayed by the
police in making arrests. sec-
ondly, the city police using clubs
and d-ogs, had chased Univers-
ity students back through the
quadrangle and onto the Tow-
ers patio, where they crowded
together surrounded by police
and dogs. This prompted the
students to shout at the police.
They yelled “brutality" and
made enenal insults

the students

joined in, tossing rolls of toilet
paper and balloons ﬁlled with wa-
ter from their windows. The po-
lice responded with a two-prong-
ed flanking movement. The police.
came, rushing through the Quad
and onto the patio, and forced
a group of students down the
Towers’ Forbes Avenue steps
into the waiting clubs and dogs

of-a-second-police-g r 0 u p, who
blocked the steps.
One student, Doug Black,

tried to get away by -running
down the steps. He was grab-

.bed and clubbed by one police-

man,even though B-lack had
said that he would not resist.
As he was being pulled down
the steps, Black said that “for
no reason at all, a cop going
up the stairs clubbed me in the
solar plexus." Then, as Blasck
lay doubled-up from the blow,
“-both policemen clubbed me
several times even though I
could not move,” he said after-
wa-rds.

W 0rd of this -and like :inci-
dents, including one on Forbes
Avenue when .a Policeman drove
his motorcycle directly at the
crowd, maintained the crowd's
fever pitch. As students were
led «away to paddy wagons, oth-
er students on the Towers patio
took up the cry against the po-
lice. The more fervent of these
would in turn be taken-awnay.

The general feeling of the stu-

was that the police had used
too much force in handling the
outbreak, and the students
would have let; off a little more
steam and gone home. Slus-

brutality, Slusser said that he
was not directly aware of any
of these incidents, and that he
would have ‘to be shown proof
to believe it. I

However, the anger of the stu-

of the police and the failure of

peared to prolong the night.
Dean of Student Affairs, Jack

situation, said that “the police
acted unfairly.”

But by app-roximateily 12:30

restored. The students, tired

Number Of Full-Time Graduate
Students Expected To Drop 70%

WASHINGTON (CPS) — The number of men entering graduate school as full-time students

next fall will be 70 per cent lower than it was last fall. if the
rent draft policy. according to a recent report.

government doesn’t change its cur-

__ The report. based on a survey conducted by the Council of Graduate Schools and the Scien-
tific Manpower Comm1ss1on‘(a private research organization). also indicated that the total enroll-
ment of first-year students in graduate school next fall will be 50 per cent lower than it was last

fall.

. . It went on to say that during the next academic year. there will be more women than men
in first-year graduate classes for the first time since World War II.

A total of 122 graduate schools,
representing about 40 per cent of
the total graduate enrollment in
the country, were included in the
survey on which the report is bas-
ed. The graduate school officials
were asked to give detailed esti-
mates of what their enrollments
would: be if no draft-eligible men
are enrolled next year.

Although the Defense Depart-
ment has said that not all graduate
students and college seniors elgi-
ble for the draft will be taken.
Mrs. Betty Vetter. executive direc-
tor of the Scientific Manpower
Commission. says that “almost all”
of them will be.

According to Mrs. Vetter. the
Defense Department projections
are based on the assumption that
men under 20 will continue to vol-
unteer for the services to the same
extent they have in the past. She
believes. though. that when 18 and
19-year—olds learn that there’s lit-
tle chance they’ll be drafted. few-
er will volunteer than in the past.

According to the report. the great-

est damage done by the draft will _
be to next year’s entering graduate
classes. Second-year classes. how-
ever. will also suffer.

The report said next years see-
8?l%l:§‘é'a¥ tastes Will have 31 'p‘el*
cent fewer men than they would
normally have. Overall. the report
indicated. second - year graduate
enrollment will be 77 per cent
lower than normal.

Although most of the figures in
the report represented averages
for schools around the country.
the authors of the report made‘
clear that some schools. and cer-
tain academic fields. would suf-

fer more than others. ,

K They pointed out that schools
with a predominately male enroll-
ment may have first-year classes
one—quarter as large as they nor-

mally would. As for academic fields

their survey indicated that the so-
cial sciences and the humanities
woulp be harder hit than the nat-
ural sciences. Medical, dental and
divinity schools are not expected
to hurt by the draft at all.

g Jordan Outlines History
And. Growth of the Negro

by ALAN E. BARR

“Negroes are gaining political power and strength in the
South. There are nearly 250 Negro elected officials in the South
today. Negro registration was below average in the five South-
ern states that Goldwater carried in 1964. This is the situation
as described by Mr. Vernon E. Jordan, Jr., in his lecture Monday
night on the “Negro and Southern Political Process.”

This new serge of Negro politi-
cal power rests in two main areas.
First. in many urban areas. white
people have been moving out while
Negroes are moving in. Also. com-'
munity organization programs.
such as the anti-poverty programs
have discovered that they must
u n i t e and emphasize political
awareness among Negroes if they
wish to see action.

The new Negro awarness has
also led to conflicts between the
old Negro leaders and the young-
er people who want a real say in
government. according to Jordan.
“There is a tremendous emotional
response. Black leaders must be
aware of new opinions that often
differ in the Black community.
The role is a difficult one."

At one time, Negro officials al-
lied themselves with conservative
whites in the community. This,
however, did not lead to improv-
ing the Negro situation. “There

are strong signs that the Negro
vote is ready to reject these alli-
ances,” said Jordan. These white
alliances have often turned and
not voted in favor of housing ques-
tions, man power programs, and
“no food stamp programs.

“Negroes are looking with in-
creasing suspicion at discriminat-
ing practices by unions." pointed
out Jordan. “Negro leaders are
aware of what is going on around
them more often.”

“Today.” pointed out Jordan.
“because of these past problems
the new Negro youth has lost faith.
Southern mayors talk of a problem
that no longer exists. Yet. in cer-
tain places. these young Negro
people still cannot go into such
places as bowling alleys.

Graduates, Undergraduates Feel Effect of Draft p

 

Students May Be Drafted
If More Troops Needed

WASHINGTON (CPS) —— Selec-

tive Service Director Lewis B.
Hershey announced this week that
undergraduate college students
may be drafted if President John-
son decides to send 200.000 more
troops to Vietnam.

\If the reserves are not called up.
Hershey said. “We would have to
contrive some way to draft under-
graduates in order to meet the in-
creased draft calls. "

He added that the number of I

students drafted “would depend
upon whether they’re going to send
them this year. next year. or some
other time. And the quicker they’d
have to send "them. the larger the
calls would have to be."

President Johnson is authorized
by law to declare “that we’ve got
to have some of those boys that
are candidates for Baccalare-
ates,” Hershey said. He empha-

sized that the Selective Service.

System presently has no plans to
determine which undergraduates
wouldbe drafted.”

“We've,abolished this old-fash-

ioned idea of thinking that people «

who pass high examinations know
any more than people who can’t

pass them at all.” Hershey said, 

referring to the new draft law

which defers all undergraduates 
doing satisfactory work. Prevous- E ‘
ly. local draft boards could’ ex- i

amine students’ college grades
and their scores on a special ex-

amination in deciding which ones‘ 

to defer.

Hershey also said he does notwi

think President Johnson’s decision
to end deferments for some grad-

uate students will have a drastic 
effect on graduate schools. “I 

have heard these cries of ‘wolf’
many times,” he said. “I4 have
a firm faith that the graduate
schools are going to live. ”

The Selective Service director. ’

said he has “every sympathy with
the president of an institution that
has gone into the graduate school
business in order to get cheap

teachers or some other reason. and A

therefore doesn’t like to have this
come along and take away his
graduate students.”

The Wrong Approach

About,¢800.. students staged a repeat performance
of last sp‘i‘ing’s so-called demonstrations yesterday.
But this.-year, the situation was aggravated by a great
number of incidents between the Pittsburgh Police

- and the students.

The Police were called to the campus when some

I 4.200 students swarmed onto Fifth Avenue and blocked

traffic. Policesuperintendent James Slusser stated
that “we received complaints that students were
blockingtraffic on Fifth Avenue. And I told my of-
ficers to arrest all people on the street.”

Superintendent Slusser told The Pitt News that
the police officers were originally instructed to re-
main just outside the campus area. The police, how-
ever, charged into the quadrangle “because we heard
word that a policeman was down in there,” said Sup-
erintendent Slusser.

 

Inside Story-

The Ordeal Of

by MIKE BROURMAN

(Edz'tor’s note: Mike Brourman, a Pitt News
reporter; was detained while taking notes during
the campus outbreak last night. In this article,
he gives a personal view of the happenings he en-
countered.)

The last three words I wrote while I
stood inside the Towers lobby were “police
storm towers.” Then my notebook was
knocked from my hand and I was grabbed.

It is not a pleasant sensation to be grabbed
around the neck, be thrown to the ground, have
your coat torn and your pants ripped, and be lit-
erally dragged into a police wa-
gon by a cursing policeman. It
is not a pleasant sensation to be
called anti-Semetic names. Maybe
it would be expected in a Fascist
state, not in America. But it hap-
pened.

IT WAS 9:30 P.M. when a
group of us, returning from the
annual Pitt News Banquet, heard
the first shouts from the Quad.
We investigated, and we stayed,
not only because we were report-
ers looking for a story, but be-
cause we were students and it
was fun to watch this innocent
display. BROURMAN

The University police, who had discarded their
holstered pistols, reacted to the “Rites of Spring”
in a rational manner. They let the students alone.

The Pittsburgh police made their first appear-
ance a few minutes later. They showed up with

 

 

A Journalist

billyclubs raised. Seeing this, a University D01iCe
sergeant ran over and told them to get out of the
Quad. They did.

BUT A FEW MINUTES later they returned.
There were no pleas to the students to disperse.
There was no talk at all. A policeman jumped off
the back of a truck, ran to the first Student he
saw, and hit him over the head with a club.

Seeing this, everyone ran, and they kept run-
ning all the way from Fifth Avenue at the patio
surrounding the Towers. The action continued until
about 11:15 p.m. when the police stormed toward
the Towers.

The students ran into the Towers, but the po-
lice chased them. A helmeted policeman chased a
group of students through the Towers, but they
escaped by running up the stairs to the second
floor. It was then that he grabbed me.

If I was resisting arrest, it was merely out of
shock and fear. The first thing I knew, I was on
the ground and my sports jacket was completely
ripped down the back.

I WAS PULLED to. my feet with the threat of
being clubbed, and then the hehneted policeman
snarled obscenities. I tried to show my press pass
and explain, but they were unwilling to listen. The
other 20 people in the wagon had similar stories.

True, there were some names shouted at the
police, but they didn’t compare in filth with the
names uttered by the police, while at the Uni-
versity and at the station.

Nor did any actions that I observed warrent the
display of untempered force shown by the police
force.

Cries of “Police Brutality” will no longer fall
on deaf and disbelieving ears at this University.

Mr. Slusser decried that “students are supposed \\\‘*\‘\\ 

  to go to school and learn. He referred to the student


actions as being idiotic and immature. When asked 

Readers S It .

about some of the causes of the disturbance, Mr.
Slusser said: “I don’t care about the causes. All I
care about is enforcing the law and you students
broke the law by blocking traffic.”

On this point Superintendent Slusser is quite
correct. The students did break the law by obstruct-
ing traffic on Fifth Avenue. But we have to question
the somewhat harsh manner used by the city police

_in their never ending enforcement of the law. Mr.
Slusser told us that “action breeds reaction.” We must
wonder, however, if the reaction of the city police
which entailed a number of serious incidents was
‘justified? ’

One of the serious incidents involved two Pitt
News reporters who were indiscriminately carted
away by the city police. One of the reporters was

. simply walking down Forbes Avenue when he was
suddenly grabbed by two police officers and thrown
into a paddy wagon.

The other reporter was sitting on a bench in the
Tower's Lobby covéring the story‘. He was simply ful-
filling his journalistic duties. But a policeman had
other ideas as to our reporter's duties. Thelofficer
grabbed him, knocked him to the ground, and ripped
the backside of his blazer in half.

These two incidents involving members of our
staff are mere microcasms of the friction last night.
One student was apprehended on the steps of Tower
A. The police didn’t simply escort him to the paddy

wagon. To add insult to injury, the law enforcement
agents sprayed chemical mace into the student’s eyes.

Another innocent student was billey-clubbed over
the head. He was taken to the hospital where doctors
administered stitches to close his wound.

We submit that the methods used by the city po-
lice yesterday were totally unjustified for demon-
strations become riots when the wrong methods are
used to subdue them.

All of yesterday’s incidents reveal the ever in-
creasing antipathy between the city police and the
students. This is unfortunately the sort of situation
that can only breed more trouble. We must therefore
demand that the city police perceive that students

- objectively and not as neighborhood troublemakers.
It is only with this needed objectivity that gap of
hostile feeling between the students and police can
be reduced.

Editor, The Pitt NEWS.

I have enclosed a carbon copy
of a letter I sent to Dean Jack
Cnitchfield. I feel that the Pitt
News should get behind a me-
morial fund for former Chancel-
lor Litchfield as it did for
Chancellor Crawford. The power
of the press, especially at Pitt
where no competition is strong,
to endorse my proposal or a
similar one is infinite.

In my letter I referred to my

past days on your newspaper-

I know that the past staff was
a very good one. There are se-
veral influencial and wise facul-
ty members assisting the paper
but it is still, free to the whims
of your heart and typewriter.

Please seize upon t his op-
portunity to do something for
your school. Chancellor Litch-
field was a remarkable man.

He made Pitt what it basical-
ly is today or was before it be-
came state related. There are
probably rumors about his lack
of financial ability, but please
remember that without Chancel-
lor Litchfield, Pitt would have
become a Penn State or Temple
a long time ago and not just
recently.

Vicki J, Epstein, '66

Dear Mr. Critchfield,

I am shocked to hear of form-
er Chancellor Edward H. Litch-
field’s fatal plane crash.

As a graduate of the Univers-
ity of Pittsburgh I can recall some
of the great deeds Mr. Litchfield
performed while at Pitt. He was
successful in making Pitt a top
rate co-llege. He made it more
than a “street car” school and
was instrumental in bringing
government grants, building new
dormitories, and attracting fam-
ous researchers and professors.

As a former news editor of

DR. EDWARD II. LITCHFIELD
Should be honored

The Pitt News, I remember a
rainy Monday in June of 1964,
Commencement Day, when the
first spade of dirt was raised to
commence ground-breaking for
the new complete Hillman Libra-
ry. Chancellor Litchfield repre-
sented nine years of change at
Pitt that day and always will be
to me and many alumni.

In memory of Chancellor Litch-
field may I propose that the three
Towers referred to as A, B and C
be named Litchfield Towers, and
that a memorial fund be set up
for Chancellor Edward H. Litch-
field and my contribution be ac-
cepted.

If you are wondering why I
have written you specifically
about this matter, please let me
explain.

I don’t know if you remember
but I often came into your office
(you were then Dean of Admis-
sions), for stories and I felt the
sincerity and hope you showed
for Pitt. In your own way, you
too stand for change and im-
provement. I feel that if any-
one can truly represent my feel-
ings about Chancellor Litchfield
to the University and Board of
Trustees, you can.

 V Sincerely,
tn-Vicki J. Epstein, '66.

 

Litchfield -- “A
Man Of X/7isiQn33

Editor, The Pitt News,

We all mourn the passing o-f
Chancellor Edward Litchfield.
Of whom it must be said, we
owe a great deal. We owe it,
not because h-e was responsible
for the erection of such struc-
tures as The Towers and The
Hillman Library, but rather for
the spirit of hope and p ride
which he instilled in the whole
University community. He was
able to do this because he was
a dynamic man who possessed
great vision.

He set a goal of excellence
for the University, and he work-
ed untiringly to this end. He was
able to see beyond the limits
of lesser men, and it was this
ability that caused him the dif-
ficulties which eventually led
to his resignation. We, the stu-
dents of Pitt, owe to him, jf
not to ourselves, the dedication
to his goal of achieving excel-
lence at our University.

There can be no more fitting
epitaph to such a man than
the words of an ancient Hebrew
prophet. “Where there is no
Vision. the people perish.”

Robert Bassman, LA 69

Basketball Fans Owe

Buzz Ridl met the press Monday at
Gustine’s, and it’s a shame that more
Pitt basketball fans couldn’t have been
there. Too many of them wrote off the
school’s chances of ever having good
basketball when Ridl’s selection was
announced last week. '

Those fans felt that Ridl didn’t fit
the new Pitt image so exemplified by
Dave Hart, Dave Adams, and Jim Ban-
ner. His recruiting ability was doubt-
ed; and, besides, even if Ridl was a
successful coaclk Westminster’s just a
small college, isn’t it?

What it all boils down to is: since
Frank Carver didn’t hire Tom Car-
mody let’s’ not give Buzz Ridl a chance.

Well, after hearing Ridl Monday,
you’ve got to believe this guy is going

to give Pitt basketball fans a fair shake.

He deserves the same from them.
Ridl agreed that he couldn’t blame

Ridl’s ability to recruit seems to be
the focal point of all the skeptics’ dis-
pleasure. Ridl likes to stand on his re-
cord on this issue.

“I’ve been recruiting despite my age
for a few years now,” he explains,
“and we’ve gotten as good talent as
you can get for our competition at
Westminster. The type of boy we’ve
had at Westminster has won even a-
gainst the major college player.” In
recent years. Westminster has beaten
Pitt frequently and Duquesne and St.
Francis on occasion. _

We want boys that want to give of
themselves and be a part of a team,”
he emphasized. “That’s the kind we
want. And if some around now can’t
do it, they can drop out.

“Our prime target area will be wes-
tern Pennsylvania,” he continued, “be-
cause I feel the boys can help us if they
stay at home.” Ridl added that he

Wrestlers Leave For Penn State

Six wrestlers and varsity strength.

coach Dave Adams left for

177 or 167. Shildt wrestled the

students for wanting someone in the
Hart image, and he revognized what
needs to be done for fan support.

“We have to give students something
they want to see,” said Ridl. “If we do
that, then they won’t care about me.
If we don’t do that, then they can yell.

“We’ve' got to make them realize
that we’re giving the best we have,”
he continued. “They have a right to de-
mand that.”

Now all he has to do is produce.
And don’t believe he’s not under pres-
sure. There’s no “stay as long as you
want” arrangement like the one Tim-
mons had. Ridl has four years.

“There’s no question that the chal-
lenges are greater,” commented Ridl.
“I think the change is stimulating to
me. I’m looking forward to getting
down here and recruiting and just talk-
ing to the boys and getting to know
what makes them go.”

FOOTBALL FAST
APPROACHING

Spring football is not too far

Penn State today at noon in

-hopes they could “make a little

noise up there” in the NCAA
wrestling championships starting
tomorrow.

The entourage included three
wrestlers that placed in the East-
ern ‘championships two weeks
ago, two who won only their first
round bouts, and one who didn’t
enter the Easterns.

Bruce Unangst who finished
second at 123 in the East, has

dropped a weight to 115 for the

nationals and probably stands the

season at 130 and was upset in the
second round of the Easterns. A1-
len grappled at 191 and 177, but
may go to 167 because of respec-
tive competition.

Strongeman Terry Hoover fin-
ished a strong third at heavyweight
in the Easterns, but he cut weight
to 191 for this weekend. During
the season Hoover vacillated be-
tween weight classes, and, as a
result, he is in no shape to take
on the 250 pound behemoths of
the Midwest.

  

Practice is scheduled to start
April 19, and Dave Hart can
hardly wait to get strated. No
wonder, hd’s welcoming to camp
a group of sophomores which
have been called by some old-

Buzz Ridl A F air Chance -,

woul¢_I«n’t abandon any of the contacts
in Ohio and Indiana as a source for
players.

“Once the boy decides he wants a big
school, there’s no reason why he can’t
come here,” elaborated Ridl. “Maybe
those other schools can offer shade
trees and southern belles; but when the
boys get there, there’s just two things
on their minds -- academics and has-
ketball. The other is just veneer; it
doesn’t last long.’’ ,

'It’s Ridl’s job to outsell the other
schools’ veneer with a sound basket-
ball program. He’s got some good sel-
ling points, especially to local talent.
Hart, Adams, and Banner have all
sold the rebuilding idea.

Can he do it? The question will re-
main unanswered for awhile. Ridl has
always been associated with winners.
It would be hard to" bet against him

If they’re that good, remain
to be seen. But there should b
a lot of good competition fo
those blue jerseys, emblemati
of a first team position. As man
as 15 sophomores should lan
starting berths.

In slightly better shape, size-
wise, is Tony Truitt. ‘Tony scored
a pin in his final dual meet of the
season, and he is looking for an
upser or two this weekend, a

Mitters DumpKansas in 1
.-Despite Numerous Fielding

by JERRY L. GRUEBEL

When the Panther baseball-
ers left Pittsburgh to partici-
pate in th e National Collegi-
ate Baseball Tournament at Riv-
erside. Calif.. coach Bobby Lewis
was worried about his team‘s hit-
ting attack. But after Monday's
9-8 win in 11 innings over Kan-
sas. Lewis’ worries should have
ended.

The Panthers trailed through-
out the game. and with one out
and no one on base in the bottom
half of the nine inning they were

‘-,~...behind 7-5. Dave Dorst then walk-
ed in a pinch hitting role. and
shortstop Ken Cooke drilled a long
home run that traveled will over
400 feet.

Additional clutch hitting by the
mitters in the bottom half of the
11th inning finally defeated Kan-
sas. Trailing 8-7 again with one
out. Cliff Brown pinch hit for
pitcher Bill Trees and singled to
right field. Back to back singles
by regulars Cooke and Tom Smith
produced the tying run. leaving
runners on first and third base.

Joe McCain was then intention-

ally passed to fill the bases. Still
“only one out, Tom Stickel prompt-

TOM SMITH
Raps Three Hits-

ly lined the ball into right field
for a clean single and a Panther
win. ,

Stickel’s hit was the mitters 16th
of the game. and obviously they
needed all of them. However. the
16 hits and nine runs should have
been more than enough.

But the baseball team displayed
atrocious fielding. committing five
errors.

suffered the most from the mis-
cues. He was charged with nine
hits and five runs. But the mit-
ter’s fielding was at its worst when
the All - American was on the
mound. Three errors in five inn-
ings is hardly-the support that
make winning pitchers.

Welty only allowed two batters
to hit the ball out of the infield.
however the inf ielders either drop-
ped the ball or couldn’t get to it in
time. when a ground ball was hit.

Poor fielding almost cost the
game in the extra innings in the
11th inning Kansas scored the go

ahead run on a single and errors -

by Cooke and second basemen Rich
Mack.

Luckily. the Panthers kept up
their clutch hitting. But the tour-
nament is in jeopardy. Lewis now
has to worry abvut the te a m ' s
fielding.

‘Pitt News’ Review

Oscar Brown Plays Cool Jazz

by SHARON LEE SHERMAN

“Sin and Soul,” singer Os-
car Brown’s interpretation of
the Negro world, canbe class-
ified as “cool jazz.” Brown is
an integrated artist, a whole
man in a compartmentalized
age, a singer, actor, compos-
er, and poet. Each song in
the record is a total state-
ment of mood and meaning—
a terse human experience, creat-
ing moments that become a com-
plete world. Chicago born. Brown
wirtes his songs from tunes. rhy-
thms, chants, and cries that he
heard as a child.

“Sin” is the first side of the rec-
0rd,. and the rhythms are heavy
and repetitive with a finger-snap-
py movement. “Work Song” is an
example. It is the cry of an impov-
erished workman who stole a loaf
of bread and was committed to a
chain gang for five years. The
rhythm is the steady thud of a
heavy hammer-quite effective and
moody.

“Bid Em In” seems more brutal
in its long two minutes than does
James Baldwin in 300 pages. A
young girl is up for auction. and
her teeth, body, and breeding abil-
ity are checked and sold for seven
dollars.

The degradation of the individ-
ual in Skid Row is well depicted,
in “Somebody Buy Me a Drink,”
where a bottle of gin compensates
for family, friends, and a job.

Brown cracks the derelict’s pain
in a boozy, moaning whine. In the
same trend of lost dreams is “Rags
and Old Iron,” the introduction to
the “Soul” side. Dreams are com-

modities for sale, a tattered piece
of cloth is exchanged for a lover’s
broken heart. Oscar Brown as the
rag peddler is cajoling, sly, and
very, very wise.

“Dat Dere” is a wondering lit-
tle boy who doesn’t realize the
meaning of hate. His father hopes
to infuse his son's mind with real-
ity while keeping the child’s spir-
it proud. A mother-child relation-
ship in “Brown Baby“ has a ten-
derness a n d sorrow unique to
Brown’s version of this song.

“Cool.. is a satirical comment on
the blase manner of our society. A
man kills his wife. is sentenced to
death. but says. “I was cool.” The

beat is bongo. with an undercur-
rent of hysteria.

Brown shows a definite concen-
tration with sexual imagery. In
“Watermelon Man,” a women is
likened to a watermelon, “round,
and ripe.” Orgasm is skillfully
conveyed in “Afro-Blue,” while
the other extreme in sensual ex-
periences is “Sleepy.”
