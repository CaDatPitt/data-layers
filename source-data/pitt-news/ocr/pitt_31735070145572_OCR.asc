For The Pitt News

It’s hard to avoi_d innuendo when
it hits you in the face. Some of the
participants in Rainbow Alliance’s
Pride Week dodgeball game last
night couldn’t resist.

“There are so many different
colored balls in here right now,” a
competitor jokingly said.

Rainbow Alliance, Pitt’s student

’ advocacy group for lesbian, gay, bi-

sexual and transgendered people,
kicked off Pride Week with the
dodgeball game but will hold more
educational events this weekas part
of Pride Week.

Stephen Kao, Rainbow Alliance
oﬁice administrator, said Pride Week
is a good follow-up to the National
Coming Out Week RainbowAl1iance
participated in last October.

“Whereas Coming Out Week .

was away to support those stressed
about coming out, Pride Week is a
celebration of that choice,” Kao
said. _ -
This was evident as students who

' had been eliminated continued to

try to catch stray dodgeballs from
the sideline for another attempt at
the game. ~

The week’s events lead up to one
of the most anticipated shows of the
year, Pride Week’s annual Drag Show.
The Drag Show will feature singing,
dancing and ﬁerce costumes.

The drag show will be held at

.8:45 p.m. Thursday in- the William

Candidate pool for pr

Consulting ﬁrm helps conduct conﬁdential search

Michael Macagnone
Senior Staﬁ" Writer

Some candidates for Pitt’s pro-
vost position face elimination
while others will face higher
levelsof scrutiny.

The Provost Search Commit-
tee, a group of students, profes-
sors and administrators, has
more than 150 candidates to re-
place Provostjames Maher, who
announced in November that he

‘will step down this fall to return '

to teaching. The committee will
spend the next few weeks nar-
rowing the list down to 15 to 20
names. '
The people on this “short list”
will face interviews, background
checks and extensive debate be-
fore the committee narrows down
its applicant pool another time,
said Randy Juhl,_the committee
chair. The committee will choose
four to six people to recommend‘
to Chancellor Mark N ordenberg,
who has the ﬁnal decision. It

hopes to have a new provost
working by the beginning of the
fall semester, if not sooner.

Getting to this point

To begin its search, the com-
mittee made a call for appli-
cants. "

Many of the more than 150
candidates were ‘nominated by
members of the Provost Search
Committee, said Dan Jimenez,
who serves on the committee
because he is the president of
the Graduate and Professional
Student Assembly.

Pitt also hired the higher edu-
cation consulting ﬁrm R. William
Funk and Associates, which is
based in Dallasto help with the
search. _ ,

The firm provided some can-

. didates’ names to the committee
and “targeted” other universities’ '

administrators whom it thinks
might be a good fit, R. William-
Funk, the ﬁrm’s president, said.

The ﬁrm focuses on provid-
ing information to the commit-
tee, suggesting names of candi-
dates and doing the background
searchesof the candidates, rather
than inﬂuencing the decisions,
Funk said.

The ﬁrm approached many of
the candidates conﬁdentially and
asked if they would be interested
in applying for the position at
Pitt. A

Conﬁdentiality is important
for the candidates as the search
goes on, Juhl said. All of the can-
didates have j obs at Pitt and other

universities, and they don’t want
to “muddy the waters” by making
their co—workers think they’re
anxious to leave, he said.

As the process continues, R.
William Funk and Associateswill

_ continue to help the University by

doing further background checks
on the candidates.

LGBT community’s presence on campus.

“It helps get Rainbow Alliance’s name
out there and lets students know there is a
community on campus that supports them,

raise money for charitable organizations,”
Weaver said. i

Pitt sophomore Aron Stone said he feels
Pride Week combats many people’s precon-
ceived notions about the LGBT community.

“Some people have no ideawho gay people
are, or they deﬁne them through stereotypes,”

' Stone said. “Pride Week shows them we’re

Stone plans to attend the Drag Show on

tion, the Human Rights Campaign, will speak

‘ Adam Dobson, Rainbow Alliance’s political
action chair, said Birch has been an inspi-
ration to the LGBT community, working to
improve human rights.

Tomorrow, Rainbow Alliance will hold the

event “Proud to be an Ally” in Room 5405 of ‘

Posvar Hall. Dobson said allies are straight
people Who.are friends of the LGBT com-
munity. ‘ ' '
“The LGBT community would not be what
it is to today without the help of straight peo-
ple,” Dobson said. “‘Proud to be an Ally’ is an
open event where gays will bring a straight
friend. The friends will talk about why it’s

important to be an ally, and we’ll talk about '

how they’ve helped us.” .

‘ Pitt staff members can join the Allies Net-
work by attending a lecture and learning to in-
teract sensitively with LGBT people. Members

Provost appointment comes as early as June

University unsure when new provost will take charge

Provost 4 3

20 candidates, a list which the committee
hopes to have chosen by May.

R. William Funk and Associates will
provide Pitt with a list of references and
perform Google and LexisNexis searches
on each candidate, Funk said.

Each candidate will then come to Pitts-
burgh for a 90-minute interview.

The committee will narrow the list
down to four to six candidates, who will
sign a release that allows Pitt to do a back-
ground check on them, Funk said. The
background check would include informa-
tion about their credit histories, litigation
histories and a check to see if they have
criminal records. A

At this point, it becomes the Chancel-
lor’s search, Funk said. The candidates will
come to campus, where they will be inter-
viewed by Chancellor Nordenberg, deans
from some of the University’s schools and
student representatives. ‘

Nordenberg could make his decision as
early as June. But Funk said these process-
es are “kind of ﬂuid,” and a new provost

' might not be in place until the beginning

of the fall semester, when Maher intends
to retire.

The qualities of a provost V

Current Provost Maher earned praise ,
for helping Pitt expand its reputation as a
research institution,Jimenez, a committee
member and the Graduate and Profession-
al Student Assembly president, said.

Jimenez, who is studying neuroscience,
said he hopes the new provost will “un-
derstand Pitt’s research strength” and-

‘continue that tradition.

Funk said a candidate’s ability to pio-
neer new research was a “key factor” in"

V the talks he had with the Provost Search

Committee and with Nordenberg.

Still, he said, the committee is focused
on building a diverse candidate pool, con-
sidering applicants’ academic background,
ethnicity and gender. 4

Juhl, the head of the committee, said
that while the candidates’ strengths in
fundraising or fostering graduate level
research are important, other factors take
priority.“ . .

The next provost needs skills “more
basic than fundraising,” he said.

Although the expectations and require-

ments are higher, they are not so different V

from most other jobs. The new provost will
‘need unquestioned integrity, a history of .
achievement at a similar job and an ability
to think on his or her feet, he said.

., Most importantly, Juhl said, the new
provost needs “a'v_ision for the future-of v
the University and the ability to commu-
nicate it.” '

He noted that the new provost will have
to be able to manage people from compet-
ing departments and programs.

THAT'S WHAT SHE SAID

 

Editor espouses fashion double standards

Vogue editor Anna Wintour ostensibly argues to end the ‘tyranny’ of child-sized clothing but rejects ‘Precious’ star ’s image

Caitlyn Christensen
Columnist

  
 

On March 22, Vogue editor-in-
chief Anna Wintour hosted a pan-
el at the Harvard Business School.
to discuss weight and wellness
in the fashion world, suppos-
edly in the hopes of promoting
“advancement for the future”
concerning sample size and the
well-being of models. Three days
later, Vogue’s magazine editors
rejected featuring “Precious” star
and Oscar nominee Gabby Sidibe
in its fashion pages because of her
size, according to PopEater.com,
an AOL celebrity news site.

Wintour, who inspired Meryl
Streep’s character in the 2006
ﬁlm “The Devil Wears Prada,”
has never been mistaken for a
sympathetic ﬁgure regarding
beauty. In a 2009 “60 Minutes”
interview, she described obese
residents of Minnesota as “little
houses” according to New York
Magazine. People magazine re-
ports that Wintour even told
Oprah Winfrey that she would
not be photographed for Vogue’s
cover unless she lost weight.

At the forum, Wintour said
that the magazine does not Pho-
toshop models to make them ap-
pear thinner. Maybe not, but that
doesn’t mean the models aren’t
dangerously thin to begin 'with.
Last year, a letter leaked from
British Vogue editor Alexandra
Shulman revealed that sample

garments are so small they only
ﬁt ﬂat-chested, emaciated mod-
els; photographs have to be Pho-
toshopped to make the models
appear heavier, so that readers
aren’t horriﬁed by their skeletal
appearances, according to The
Hufﬁngton Post. Vogue might not
need to make its models appear

sample clothes. A fashion source,
Styleite.com, explai_ned that
Sidibe couldn’t be photographed
by Vogue because sample sizes
are too small for a “regular-sized
girl,” let alone the’ overweight
actress. Apparently, Wintour is
willing to speak out against small
sample clothes but not willing to

jobs when they ﬁll out and hence
don’t last long enough to develop
public personalities, like the ’90s
supermodels did. As a result,
most magazine covers and lucra-
gtive beauty contracts have gone
to singers and actresses.”
Sidibe is an actress not lacking
in public personality. Rising from

If [Anna Wintour] really thought that small
sample sizes were such a problem, she

could do something about it.

any thinner than reality.

It’s one thing to promote
healthy living and another to tai-
lor beauty to pre-conceived stan-
dards. Sidibe is obese, but both
obesity and being underweight
are dangerous medical condi-
tions. Wintour is not promoting
any kind of healthy incentive by
restricting Sidibe from appearing
in her magazine’s pages. She just
doesn’t want to portray someone
who doesn’t conform to her idea
of beauty. By refusing to photo-
graph Sidibe, Wintour is promot-
ing a philosophy that favors ap-
pearance over character. ‘

Wintour playing host to the
Harvard panel created a nice pro-
gressive illusion for Vogue. At the

panel, she spoke about “revers- O

ing the tyranny” of child-sized

actually do anything about the
“tyranny.” I .

Wintour is arguably the most
powerful woman in the fashion
industry. If she really thought
that small sample sizes were such
a problem, she could do some-
thing about it. She rescheduled
the massive 2008 Milan Fashion
Week just so she had time to re-
turn home between traveling to
France and Italy at the inconve-
nience of other designers. If she
wanted to, surely Wintour has the
wherewithal to ﬁnd a plus—sized
designer sample for Sidibe.

At the Harvard panel, Win-
tour also noted Vogue’s tendency
to use younger models, saying,
“Most models only work when
they have the uber—slim physique

of the very young, stop getting

obscurity, her role in,“Precious”
garnered her nomination for the
Best Actress Academy Award. She
won the NAACP Image Award for
Outstanding Actress in a Motion
Picture and the Independent
Spirit Award for Best Lead Fe-'
male. V

. But apparently, talent and
public personality aren’t really
enough for Vogue. The magazine
is following in the petty footsteps
of Vanity Fair, which snubbed
Sidibe from its annual Young
Hollywood issue — despite the
fact that the 26-year-old actress
generated so much hype the past
year. Sidibe is being hailed as a
‘fashion example forplus-sized
women and was the cover girl for
the March issue of Ebony Maga-
zine. Wintour might have spoken

prettily about fashion progres-
sion, but her walk doesn’t ﬁt the
talk.

Vogue’s refusal to photograph
Sidibe is another instance in a
long line of the fashionista’s
fascism. In addition to deny-
inggoprah cover space, Wintour
advised Hillary Clinton that she

-could not be photographed for

the cover unless she abandoned
her navy blue suits, according
to Slate.com, a web magazine.
Although it is inherent to her

trade, Wintour takes elitism to a “

whole new level. A Vogue writer
once said that Wintour regularly
excludes women in service work
from the magazine’s pages. A
feature about breast cancer that
began with the story of an airline
stewardess reportedly had to be
revised, and writers had to seek
out a high-ﬂying businesswom—
an with breast cancer to write
about instead. Wintour can talk
all shewants about advancement
for the future, but the sunglass-
clad, Chanel-suited prima donna
can’t really connect withthe real
world unless her magazine be-
gins to truly recognize that re-
ality doesn’t conform to preset
beauty standards. Promoting.

advancement while continuing A

to practice the same ideals only
makes Wintour lose credibility as
a progressive voice in the fashion
industry.

We have all been there. It is the ﬁrst

the ‘My Grades’ page on Peoplesoft.

One by one, a brick of our fate is
laid down, and when it’s ﬁnally over,
we see the whole foundation. There
might be a few A’s, some B’s and pos-
sibly some grades that are not as

The academic competitiveness-

reason we came to college in the ﬁrst

I have looked for the least resistive
path to decent grades. I’ve frequent-

Ientered college with that attitude
— to get the highest statistics I could

equations, the calculus derivations,
the abstractthinking‘—— itwasbeyond
me. I would stay up into the morning
trying to perfect my lab reports, pos-
sibly to buffer my grade —’— life was
ﬁ1ll of entropy.

I ended the term on a low note, and

I was exhausted.

But I would never undo it if I
could. I learned more about physical
and analytical chemistry than I ever
would have if I didn’t sign up for this
course.

Sure‘, my overconﬁdence, rather

' thanmydesireforsciencelmowledge,

drove me to take the class, but the

result was the same. I learned much

more,‘ and I learned not to take the ‘

easy way out all the time.

That is an idealistic thought, but
why would one take the lower grade
every time?Just to learn? Psh.

More likely than not, by weather-

ingsuchcourses,youwilladjusttothe C

skills required. You’ll learn the mate-
rial wholeheartedly, and eventually
earn the grades you want.

It’s like when I took Human Physi-
ology last term.

Everyone who had taken this
course told me horror stories about
the material and the exams. The sto-
ries even revealed that the professor
would give students questions they
had never seen.

Well, that might have been true,
but everyone who offered these an-
ecdotes always ended saying it was

. worth it.

I took the course, and I loved it.
Multiple—hour lectures are no one’s
favorite, but the class engaged my
mind and I was  learning the

material cold.
I have more conﬁdence in answer-

-» ing a physiology question than a po-

litical science one. At the end, I also
earned the grade I wanted.

Maybe our prudence in taking
courses is hindering. I am no academic
advisor, but I can say that if you feel
hesitant about a certain course be-
cause you don’t have the blessings of
RateMyProfessors.com oryourpeers,

take a chance. You could very well '

learn and enjoy yourself more than
that guaranteed—grade class.

Taking demanding courses is not
directly related to lower grades. Feel-

ing so is a psychological complex -

you only limit yourself.

.. As long as you learn enough the
ﬁrst time to be able to handle ﬁiture
“hard” courses, you will only enrich
your academic experience. You might
also feel a little more proud next time

CONCERT PREVIEW

Electro—Africanartist percusses tonight

Percussionist Lukas Ligeti plans to unleash his African rhythms onto Pittsburgh as part of his solo tour.

Brendan Coticchia
For The Pitt News

People say that musicians are
born, not made, but this is not
the case for Hungarian-born
composer and percussionist

..Lukas Ligeti.

Ligeti, known for his fusion
of world music and electronic
beats, told The Pitt News in a
phone interview that he “start-
ed late, when I was 18 and after
I’d already graduated from high
school.”

Given the complex, frenzied
nature of his work, as well as
his relation to his father Gyorgy
Ligeti, who composed the scores
for such ﬁlms as “The Shining”
and “2oo1: A Space Odyssey,” the
revelation seems surprising.

“I just had to admit to my-
self that I was always hearing a
soundtrack in my head,” Ligeti
said. “After that, it was inevi-
table.” I

Ligeti ﬁrst began his foray
into music by determining what
instrument he felt was most ac-
cessible to him, even at such a
late age, and eventually he settled
on the drums.

“It was sort of an ironic
choice. At the time, I had a very
strong melodic imagination, but
I didn’t really know much about
rhythm.”

However, because of the dif-
ﬁculties he experienced, from
ﬁnding a space to play to not
waking the neighbors, Ligeti
admits he “may have chosen
something else.” ,

Ligeti’s compositions draw
from a wide range of inﬂuences
but particularly from world mu-
sic and the long history of sym-
phonic music.

“I think a lot of experimental
musicians make the mistake of
thinking that there is a gap be-
tween 1750 and 1920, with the
only worthwhile forms coming
before or after,” he said.

African music began to fas-
cinate Ligeti after a 1994 trip he
took to the continent.

“I related to it emotionally,”
he said. “At the time, I was look-
ing for different ways of thinking
about music, and the way that it
focuses on feeling rhythms really

drew me in.”
Ligeti’s passion for African
music led him and several friends

to become members of the group I

Burkina Electric, an interna-
tional collective that combines
electronica with traditional West
African styles. a

When performing with Burki-
na Electric, Ligeti plays a percus-
sion-based synthesizer called the

. marimba lumina, which is also

the primary instrument_he uses
on his ongoing solo tour.

“Even though I work with
electronic music, I don’t want to
be a laptop performer,” he said.
“So it’s a perfect fit.”

The American Composers

Orchestra, Bang on a Can and A

the Kronos Quartet have com-
missioned Ligeti’s unique music.
He is involved in many collabora-
tions with other musicians, such
as John Zorn, Henry Kaiser, Jim
O’Rourke and Gary Lucas.

Ligeti said that his biggest
challenge in participating in so
many projects, and composing
music in general, is finding the
time.

“Music is time consuming,” he
said. “Even if you aren’t involved
in the administrative aspects,
it’s incredibly work extensive.
You’re basically writing down
thousands and thousands of tiny,
little notes. It’s not easy, but I

enjoy it.”

AMT Public Relations . I
Lukas-Ligeti gets a little inspiration for his rhythms everywhere.

TECH ANALYSIS

Loophole

 
    
 

Donald Campbell
Columnist

After a long and public dispute with
China over censorship, it looks like
Google has found a loophole.

To recap, Google responded to a
recent hacking attack on its servers
in China by threatening to abandon

pits Google against Chinese officials

its Chinese business interests unless
the Chinese government allowed
Google to stop all censorship of its
search results.

The Chinese government re-
mained ﬁrm and insisted that all
technology companies in China must
abide by existing “self-censorship”
laws —- speciﬁcally, Google.cn would
need to ﬁlter sensitive topics from its

search results. ‘

Afterall ofthis transpired, Google
was put in a very awkward position.
It did not want to walk away from its
investment in China, as that would
mean signiﬁcant loss in its commer-
cial foothold.

The Chinese government did not
seem likely to change its position.

Google remained statistically less

popularthanthe homegrown Chinese
search engine Baidu, and it had very
little true leverage against Chinese
intransigence.

On March 23, the Washington Post
reported that Google came up with a
clever new option. Google began re-
directing visitors from Google.cn to
Google.hk, its search engine system
based in Hong Kong. _

Because Hong Kong’s government '

administration is somewhat indepen-
dent of the Chinese government in
Beijing, the search results of Google.
hk are not subject to the same self-
censorship requirements.

The switch is technically legal but
represents an affront to the Chinese
government.

Depending onwhom you ask, this

move is both avictory for Google and
an omen of things to come.

Other businesses that have in-

terests in China are worried that
Google’s move could result in a sour-
ing relationship between U.S.—based

. businesses and the Chinese govem—

ment. V
Many are elated that Google has
taken abold step in standing up to op-
pressive Chinese censorship laws.
Whetherthe Chinese government
wi1lbegintreatingU;S. businesses dif-
ferently is unclear. ‘ » 5 ’ ‘ '

The Washington Postreported 

on March 25, however, that Google’s
decision undoubtedly signals aneraof

greater assertiveness by business— '
es with the Chinese government. " ~ » _ ,1.
‘Accordingto CBS News, GoDaddy.

com, awebsite that registers domain
names on the Internet, will no lon-
ger register domain names within

China.

GoDaddy.com effectively pulled
out of the Chinese market in response
to more stringent registration require-
ments the Chinese government irnple— .
mented. New domain registrants will
be required to provide very personal
information, including an identiﬁca-
tion photograph.

For those who think that the Chi-

nese censorship machine will begin '

to crumble, Google’s move might only

prove to be primarily symbolic.
Users sent through Google.hk

still use existing Chinese networks,

so the Chinese government is per-

fectly capable of forcing censorship
and blocking access. - i

The Unthanks might deserve a round of ap-

messages when searching for sensitive topics,
such as the publicized 1989 government crack-
down on student protesters in Beijing.

Google’s Chinese users and its Chinese rival
Baidu might limit the long-term impact of the
decision.

Google still has less of a market share than
Baidu, and many of Google’s users would much
ratheruse Google’s services censored than make
a stand and do without them.

A blog that Jonathan Stray posted on The

 

 

f.-'—*~

4 ~..u

New York Times’ website quotes a Chinese citi-
zen who uses Baidu for patriotic reasons.

One possible outcome is a complete blockage
of Google’s services, followed by a takeover of
the search market by Baidu.

Google might have the moral high ground,
but it could still be forced out of the Chinese
market. V

The high ground is still Google’s.-Before
Google.cn’s redirection to Google.hk, Google
imposed self—censorship rules by itself.

After the redirection, all censorship efforts
are being instantiated by the Chinese govern-
ment, without any actions by Google.

No matter the outcome, the Washington
Post deﬁnitely has a point: Google’s decision
marks a turning point in China—U.S. business
relations.

Google’s newest decision will more likely ‘ ‘

than not result in a reduction in China’s censor-
ship efforts, but it’ might indirectly lead to less
oppressive Chinese information policy.

SOFTBALL FEATURE

Zinger findssecond family in softballgteam

Senior pitcher Kayla Zinger provides leadership, ‘sisterly competition’ for Pitt’s younger pitchers

Torie Wytiaz
Staff Writer

Under the starlight of a Las Vegas
sky, the atmosphere of a family
reunion permeated the ﬁeld. ‘

4 Mother, father, brother, aunts,

— uncles and cousins took overthe

stands at Eller Media Stadium at
the‘University of Las Vegas as the
Pitt softball team took on UNLV in
a tournament contest.

For then—sophomore pitcher
Kayla Zinger, it was a homecom-
ing of sorts as the Phoenix, Ariz.,
native performed in front of her
family.

“That was the one time where
everyone in my family was able to
see my play in my college career,”

Zinger said. “Family is so impor-

tant to me, and being in Las Vegas
was the closest Pitt has ever played

' to Phoenix.”

Zinger, now a senior, has com-
piled an impressive list of accom-
plishments during her time at Pitt.
She is currently tied for fourth

place in Pitt history for career A

shutouts with six and holds the
third—place spot for career ERA
at 2.52.

Zinger might have a supportive
family in Arizona, but she has also
come to recognize her softball
teammates as sisters in a some-
what less-sunny environment.

“When I first came to Pitt
for an official visit, it rained the
whole time,” Zinger said. “Still,
the whole team and coaching
staff was incredibly welcoming
and tight—knit, just like my own
family.” .

Zinger has been around com-
petitive softball for years, in-

cluding her participation in club _

Kayla Zinger has closed out a team-high ﬁve games this season as a relief pitcher.

and travel organizations in high
school. Again, the athletic event
became a family affair.

“My brother played travel

T baseball, as well. So both of my

parents were heavily involved with
our practice and playing’ sched-
ules,” Zinger said.

Even in her freshman season,
Zinger was able to ﬁnd her role
within the Pitt softball family,
as she appeared in 26 games as a
ﬁrst-year pitcher.

“Coming into that ﬁrst season, I
knew that I would have to be ready
to contribute,” Zinger said. “But
pitching at the collegiate level is a
whole different mental game.”

' But as in most families, the old-
er “siblings” offered their veteran
advice to Zinger as she developed

. into a vital part of Pitt’s roster.

“I remember coming in as
a freshman, and senior pitcher
Meghan Bostick really took me un-
der her wing and always seemed to

‘ know what to say to me to calm me

down when I became frustrated,”

Zinger said.

Now, three years later, Zinger
herself represents the veteran
leadership on the Panther team
as one of only two seniors and the
only senior pitcher.

Zinger’s role has changed

“There is always competition
among teammates, but with us,
it’s a friendly competition like you
would have with a sister,” Zinger
said. “It’s not brutal in any way,
and ultimately, we all want the

team to succeed.” 4::

batter and do what i need to do
to get the out. And when i do, it’s

during her career as a Panther,
partly because of “sisterly com-
petition.”

As Zinger’s senior mentors
graduated, two stellar freshman
pitchers, Pitt recruited Cory Ber-
liner and Alyssa 0’Connell and of-
fered a challenge to Zinger.

kind of an ‘Aha!’~ feeling.

Berliner and 0’Connell have
become the two primary starting
pitchers, but Zinger maintains a
valuable role in relief pitching,
as she has ﬁnished a team-high
ﬁve games this season, including
one save.

Yet nothing seems to compare

Pitt sweeps St- John’s, wins llthstraight

Panthers now 1.8-4 as they win their first three games of Big East Conference play .

Greg Trietley
Sta_ﬁ"Writer

’/‘Q

The new sports complex opens next spring,
but if Pitt baseball keeps playing this well
at cold, wet Trees Field, it won’t be in a
hurry to move.

Starting pitchers Corey Baker, Matt Ian-
nazzo and Nathan Hood improved their
records to a combined 14-0 as the Pan-
thers swept St. John’s in a rain-shortened
series.

Pitt held the Red Storm to ﬁve runs all
weekend to open the Big East schedule 3-0.

‘The Panthers are now 18-4 on the season -

and winners of 11 straight. . '

Baker kicked off the series by allowing
only one run on ﬁve hits and striking out
seven batters in seven innings, and Pitt de-
feated the Red Storm, 4-1. He and Sunday’s
starter, Hood, are now tied for second in
the Big East in strikeouts.

“We are a bit thin on the mound,” Pitt
head coach Joe Jordano said. “We need
those guys to take us deep into ball games
on the weekend. To date, they have done
a great job.”

All the run support Baker needed Friday
came in the ﬁrst inning, when ﬁrst baseman
David Chester hit his ﬁrst homerun of the
year to give Pitt an early 2-0 lead. Chester
drove in ﬁve in the three games against
St. John’s.

This guarantees more national exposure
for both WVU and Pitt, which helps Dixon in
his recruitment endeavors, as well.

WVU’s Final Four berth also helps out the
rest of the Big East’s recruitment, for much
of the same reasons it helps Pitt’s. Perennial
bubble teams like Cincinnati and Seton Hall
can market toward recruits by pointing out
‘ that their team
will have the
chance to play
several Final
Four contend-
ers every year.

If you
think quality
of opponents
doesn’t help
r e c r u i t i n g ,
look no further
than the topic
of today’s dis-
cussion. Prior
to joining the

WVU made a. Big East in
Final Four be- 1991, WVU
fore Pitt. But only made the
after a brief second round
reﬂection, I’ve of the NCAA
determined a , Tournament
that this can 0 six times in
only be a good  its 36 years of
thing for Pitt. " :7 basketball.
Think about it: Once they
it’s goodforthe started play-
Big East and re- . 1‘ ing perennial
cruiting. MCT Campus powers like
After only WVU’s Da’Sean Butler (No. 1) drives-to the hoop - Syracuse and
two Big East against Kentucky on Saturday. Villanova, the

teams made it e
to the Sweet «

16, the analysts said the Big East was over-
rated this year. But the conference still sent
a team to the Final Four. That’s something
only three other conferences can claim.

Besides saving face for the conference, it
helps with recruiting, especially for WVU.

I know it doesn’t sound like a good thing
that WVU received a boost in recruitment,
but it actually makes sense.

This guarantees that WVU will be com-
petitive foryears to come, and as long as Pitt
head coach Jamie Dixon’s around, Pitt will
also be competitive.

- Therefore, the Backyard Brawl will con-
tinue to grow, and if next year’s games are
half as good as Pitt’s triple-overtime win
this season, then the rivalry will continue
to gain national exposure. V

Who knows, maybe even ESPN will realize

Mountaineers
made the Sweet
16 ﬁve times, including this season.

Pitt saw a similar improvement. Pitt
only appeared in the Sweet 16 twice prior
to joining the Big East in 1982. Pitt now has
ﬁve Sweet 16 appearances in the past nine
years. ’

One can only expect that it is a matter of
time for the newer members of the Big East,
such as Cincinnati, to achieve the sustained
success that Pitt and WVU have found.

But the recruiting advantages only matter
to a certain point. Sure, a national champi-
onship sounds nice to recruits,but recruits
mainly look for Final Four hopes.

That means WVU’s success is good for
the Big East and for recruitment, but the
advantages end at the Final Four. I

So feel free to root heavily for Duke Sat-

urday. I know I will be. ’

to that ﬁrst no-hitter that Zinger pitched in
a Big East conference game against Con-
necticut in her sophomore season.

“The feeling after that game was just one

of accomplishment and success,” Zinger

bsaid. “When I pitch like that, I feel like I
did my job.” ‘
Zinger said she considers herself a stu-
dent of the game and spends a great deal of
time analyzing batters and their tendencies,

 

hoping to win the “pitcher-batter battle.”

“Each batter that comes to the plate
presents a different challenge, like a puz-
zle,” she said. “I try to adapt to that par-
ticular batter and do what I need to do to
get the out, and when I do, it’s kind of an
‘Aha!’ feeling.”

Such commitment to the learning pro-
cess comes naturally to Zinger, who will
graduate with a degree in rehabilitation

PITT PROJECT OALAND

Pitcher will attend Pitt grad school on scholarshi

science.

’ After graduation, she will continue her
educationat Pitt in the Graduate School of
Health and Rehabilitation Sciences with the
support of the George I. Carson Graduate
Fellowship.

“I am excited" to have the opportunity
to stay involved with the athletic program
here at Pitt, whether in helping out at soft-
ball practice or tutoring student-athletes,”
Zinger said. “The family of student-athletes
at Pitt really transcends teams, and all of
us get to know each other.”

Zinger noted that all the athletes are
grouped together and that “it just makes
sense” to form relationships. In particular,
she has become close with many members
of the women’s volleyball team. S 1

She is quick to mention the fun that
comes with participating in athletics, but
she still sets high goals for herself and for
her team. '

“It is always my goal to go out and pitch
with as low of an ERA as possible so that I
can give our offense a chance to score runs
and win the game,” Zinger said. “Excel-

lent personal statistics are nice to have,‘

but they do not mean much without that
team victory.” A

. In contributing this year, Zinger said
she hopes Pitt can once again earn a place
in the Big East championship. The Pan-
thers qualiﬁed for the tournament during
Zinger’s freshman and sophomore seasons
but fell short last year.

“We are looking to get back to the cham-
pionships this year,” Zinger’ said, “and I
think that this year’s team has the chem-
istry to do that.” ‘

T  of
  
at  really

transcends teams,

an all of as arts

know each otiier.

Though far from home, Zinger has gar-

nered the support of both her original fam- p

ily and her “adopted” team family.

Her parents and her brother set aside
time each season to attend one game and
one tournament, and her father is currently
in Pittsburgh to see her play.

“My dad always saves his vacation time
for softball season,” Zinger said with a
smile. '

Still, in his absence, Zinger’s Pitt fam-
ily provides her with the motivation and
friendship on which she thrives to pitch a

. lights—out game.

Rain shortens Pitt ’s win over Red S torm
Heavy rains on Sunday shortened Pitt"s 3rd game versus St. John’s to 7 innings; Pitt won 5 -3.. 0

' Baseball 4 14

"‘Chester had a very solid weekend,”_Ior-

V dano said. “But I believe there were several

others that did, as well — too numerous to
mention them all.” y ’

Chester would add another homerun
to his total the next day when he led off
the third inning withea solo homerun. Pitt
routed the Redfstorm 13-1, and every Pan-
ther starter scored ‘at least one run.

Already leading 4-0 in Saturday’s game,
Pitt pulled away from the Red Storm with a
ﬁve-run fourth inning that ended starting
pitcher Kyle Hansen’s day.

' Sean Hagan entered to replace Hansen,
only to walk Chester, throwa wild pitch
-that scored outﬁelder John Schultz and
hit catcher Kevan Smith.

St.]ohn’s pitchers plunked ﬁve Panthers
Saturday, including Smith twice.

One of the ﬁve Panthers hit was third
basemenjoe Leonard, who went 2-for-3 on
the day, stole his fourth base of the year
and bumped his batting average up to a
team-leading .443. ’ _ 0

s With Pitt leading 9-0 in the seventh,
Iannazzo made his only mistake of the
afternoon and surrendered a solo homer-
un to St. John’s Jeremy Baltz. Iannazzo,

though, struck outjimmy Parque and'Joe ‘

Panik, the Red Storm’s two best hitters,
three times on the day.

Iannazzo struck out six in the game to
, earn his fourth win of the year.

' Rain held off long enough Saturday, but
Mother Nature wasn’t so kind to St. _]ohn’s
on Sunday, as Pitt won, 5-3, in a weather-
shortened game of seven innings.

_ ' Heavy rain starting falling around 1:30
p.m., and the game was delayed for almost

a half hour before the games was called A

ﬁnal. ‘

“The weather affected Sunday’s game in
a big way,”Jordano said. “We had a steady
rain for most of the game, but after the
top of the seventh the ﬁeld was just not
playable.” l ' '

. Before the rain, though, Pitt jumped
out to a 3-0 lead. in the third inning when
pitching mistakes again haunted St.John’s.
Matt Carasiti walked three Panthers to

0' load the bases before throwing a wild pitch

that allowed. outﬁelder Zach Duggan to
score. Chester then drove in Danny-Lopez
to make it 2-0. , .

Lopez now leadsthe conference with
37 runs scored, six more than any other
Big East player.

Carasiti was pulled, but Stephen Rivera '
.continued what his teammate began. Ri-

vera, too, threw a wild pitch and walked a
batter to again load the bases. A ﬁelder’s
choice that scored Leonard and a Sean

Toole ﬂy-out ended the inning, but not be- -

fore the Panthers scored three runs on one

hit, four walks and three wild pitches.

' With Pitt up 5-1 after six, St.John’s tried
to claw back in the game. The Red Storm
loaded the bases against relief pitcher Cole
Taylor before Ray Black entered the contest
to stop the rally. Pitt traded two runs for
two outs on ﬁelder’s choices and escaped
the inning still up two.

What stopped St. John’s rally for good,
though, was the weather. The Red Storm
never returned to the plate_because the
game was called in the bottom of the sev-
enth. _

“The Red Storm is always at the top of
the league,”Jordano said. “So for us to win
the series was a great accomplishment for

our program.”

The victory gave the Panthers yet an- .
other home win. They are now a perfect 5-0 0
at home despite Sunday’s bad weather.

Pitt, though,.travels to Piscataway, N.].,
to begin a three-game series at Rutgers '
starting Thursday afternoon. The forecast:
72 degrees and sunny.
