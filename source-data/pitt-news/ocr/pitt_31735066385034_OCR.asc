Researchers test drug
to treat memory loss

By Erik Kridle

Staff Writer

There is new hope for Alzheim-
er’s disease patients. Pitt scientists
have synthesized a pharmacolog-
ical agent used for centuries by
the Chinese to combat memory-
loss diseases.

Chemistry Professor Alan P.
Kozikowski, coordinator of the
group credited with_the synthesis,
said that the agent, Huperzine A,
has been tested in China, Switzer-
land and the United States on
both animals and humans.

According to Kozikowski, Alz-
heimer . patients treated with
Huperzine ”show a marked im-
provement in memory for an ex-
tended period of time [about four
hours].” '

The discovery by the Pitt team
will make it easier to develop and
mass-produce Huperzine in the
future, he said.

At present, Kozikowsky is seek-
ing a patent for the agent.

Young poets and fiction writers
at Pitt have formed an informal
social group that has met since
March for weekly meetings and
discussions of student works.

”|t’s a good social group for
people who like to write,” said
‘Jay Katz, head of the group at Pitt,
whose weekly meetings alternate
between poetry and fiction.

Founder Katz said the group is
especially helpful to freshmen
who want to better their writing
skills.

He said, ’’I’m a senior and we
didn't have a group like this
when I was a freshman, and I'm
sure that when you're first start-
ing out, you're kind of hesitant
about writing because it's some-

T thing that is going to take time.

”|t’s not going to be pub|isha-

A variety of topics were ad-
dressed at yesterday's Inter-
fraternity Council meeting.

Guest speaker Cornell
McMul|in discussed the possi-
bility of the lFC’s help to spon-
sor and create publicity via a
walk—a-thon for the National
Neurofibromatosis Foun-
dation.

Neurofibromatosis is a dis-
ease that attacks the nerves
with tumors, possibly causing
blindness, limb deformation

and even death.

The walk—a-thon will take
place on Saturday, Oct. 1 at
South Park. McMullin, NNF
membership chairman, said,
“We need help with public
awareness, and we hope you
will make this your project."

A new system of Greek
identification was introduced
in the form of a_blue index
card. This card will replace the
old ID method of a Greek‘
sticker. ,

On the subject of rush, IFC
Vice President Dave Wilcox
congratulated the brothers on
a successful drive.

According to Wilcox, this
year's drive was the ”best in

years.” The total number of
pledges was 236, an increase
of 21 pledges from last year.
A rush survey will be distribut-
ed at the next meeting on the
subject of efficiency.

A new policy of the Greek
Happy Hour festivities was,
enacted. Instead of charging a
flat rate to each fraternity, a
dollar per head is now the
rate. The first Happy Hour of
the year will be held this Fri-
day in the Phi Delta Theta,
house at 4 p.m.

Due to an opening on the
judicial board, first—round
nominations were accepted.

Organization forms to unite Pitt pool players

By Brendan Kevenides
Staff Writer

There are 27 different ways to
complete each shot in the game
of pool, and now there is a club
on campus that will teach Pitt stu-
dents every one of them, accord-
ing to Donald Broggi, president
and founder of the Panther Pock-
et Billiards Club.

The club became certified on
Tuesday by Student Activities and
currently has a constitution and
its own advisers. Broggi said that
he planned to request emergen-

cy funding from the Student
Government Board yesterday.

Emergency funding allows the
SGB to vote on allocations as the
club requests them. They do not,
however, allow the club to ap-
peal the Board’s decision.

The club has existed for sever-
al years, according to Broggi, but
only as a clique of pool players
in the William Pitt Union, and it
currently has about 50 members.
Broggi expects membership to
double within two weeks after
they have had a chance to ad-
vertise.

According to Broggi, the club

is a melting pot of ethnic back-
rounds and consists of a friendly
atmosphere.

”l founded this organization to
teach people about the game,”
said Broggi.

Broggi said that teaching clin-
ics will begin next Thursday and
will offer rudimentary instruction
in straight pool, eight ball, snook-

er (a mid—eastern game), billiards,

one pocket and nine ball.

The game of pool, said Broggi,
involves a great deal of geome-
try and statistics and is not as sim-

ple as most people may believe. .

The clinics will teach students

shots such as banking, massas, in
which the cue stick is elevated in
order to strike down on the cue
ball, caroms, in which a ball is re-
bounded off another in order to
pocket the target ball, draw shots
and fore shots. The club will also
offer advanced instruction and
help persons master the diamond
system.

”Peop|e probably don't realize
this, but we have the best pool

hall on the East Coast,” said Brog-‘

gi, referring both to the players
and the facilities at Pitt.
The club has sent players to na-.

NOW to fight new unisex automobile insurance

HARRISBURG (AP) ~ The Na-
tional Organization for Women
plans legal action against the state

Insurance Department's orders‘

requiring unisex car insurance
pricing, which could boost rates
for young women by as much as
70 percent.

NOW scheduled a news con-
ference at the capitol Thursday to
outline its plans. Attorney Laurie
Williams of Harrisburg declined
to discuss the legal action until
the announcement.

In an April 26 order, Common-
wealth Court found gender-based
rates violated Pennsylvania's
Equal Rights Amendment.

As a result, male drivers youn-
ger than 25 no longer can auto-
matically be charged higher rates
merely because they are men, as
has been the case. The insurance
industry had argued that sex was
a legitimate rating factor because
young men have more driving ac-
cidents than young women.

Pennsylvania will be the sixth
state to adopt unisex rates.

:9-I-4/A T team mobilizes
‘itself for public safety

By Mark R. Brown

Contributing Editor

In a neighborhood near the
North Hills, residents hear
screaming and shouting coming
from a house. Police officers are
called to investigate the most un-
predictable and potentially vola-
tile of disturbances — the
domestic quarrel.

A local officer knocks on the
door of the address to which he
has been called. The response
given is a gun stuck in his face by
a man inside, along with heated
profanity and threats. The officer
retreats to his car to radio for as-
sistance. A potential hostage sit-
uation is more than he or his
colleagues can handle.

In response, members of the
Allegheny County Police Anti-
Sniper Squad and a hostage
negotiating team arrive on the
scene. Information from neigh-
bors is gathered, and a picture is
brought into focus: the residents
are a male in his late 30s who is
a Vietnam veteran and his wife.
At least one other male was sight-
ed inside of the building.

The hostage—taker is dressed in
black and is carrying a black au-

‘tomatic pistol. The ‘man is

screaming and swearing alter-
nately in English and Vietnamese,
and threatening to start shooting.
At some moments, he seems to
be back in the war.

The PASS members are de-
ployed into containment teams

which guard and observe the en-
trances to the building, as well as
sniper control teams and entry
"assault” teams. A command
post is set up nearby, where data
on the situation is collated and
analyzed. Every bit of information
is potentially useful to senior
police officials onlthe scene.
Outside the building where the
hostage-taker continues to rant
and rave, the containment team
adjusts its position to improve
what protection is available and
to be in the best location to help.
Dressed in black jungle fatigues

and wearing black kevlar bullet— «

proof vests, the officersmaintain
a low profile while hostage
negotiators attempt to cope with
the situation.

”|ncoming! Incoming! Take
cover! Cooks! I'm gonna start
wasting you mothers!” were the
shouts coming from inside the
crisis scene. Outside, a psychol-
ogist on a retainer with the police
is trying to get a better idea of
who and what he’s dealing with.

Negotiators continue to make
contact and rationalize with the
hostage-taker. From inside the
building, a shot is heard.

”ls anybody hurt?” the negoti-
ators yell into the building.

”|’ll. kill you both! I'm gonna
waste all you ...”

”What is the problem?”

”Why do you care?”

’’I care.”

of the situation are agreed upon.
The tense atmosphere is like that

”His name is Mike Wess.”

”Two other people in there.”

”Was anybody shot?”

”Does he have a telephone?

Let's talk to him.”

The hostage negotiators find
out that he doesn't have a phone
and getehim to agree to receive
a field telephone. The negotiators
continue to converse with the
hostage-taker during his more lu-
cid moments. ”I’m gonna take

”What voices, Mike?”

”They’re in my head. They

The negotiators, working with

and interviewed. The situation
just changed from a hostage
scene to that of a barricade. Safe-
ty remains the primary concern.
”l ran out when he went to the
bathroom,” the wife tells the
police.

After some time and continued

‘ skillful negotiations, Mike agrees

to throw out his pistol and sur-
render. A vehicle containing the
assault team flanks the contain-
ment team as Mike opens the
door

A shot rings out from inside the
building; one of the containment
team has been shot in the leg.
”Officer down, paramedic for-
ward,” goes out the radio call.
Seconds later, the wounded
officer is receiving treatment.

Mike throws out his pistoland
is told to lie face down in the dirt.
His pistol is kicked away from his
reach as he is searched; a second
pistol is found under his belt. He
is handcuffed and whisked away
as the assault team clears the
building.

The above was enacted last
Thursday at the Police Academy,

UUDDDHUUUUUUI lUUUUl JUI IUUUUUIUD

part of the ongoing training that
the PASS team conducts.

According to Allegheny
County Police Superintendent
Robert Kroner, ’’I’m very proud
of them. They've received the
best equipmentand training pos— I
sible. The county commissioners
support us to the hilt. They be-
lieve that we should have the
best. And they continue to get
better."

Katz and Garrett also stress that
anyone can become involved.
This includes people who, for
one reason or another, may not
want to write something right

away. They can simply go to
meetings, listen and learn.
”Our long—term goal is to get a
really big-name speaker and see
if we can get help from other big

organizations such as the Pitt Pro-
gram Council,” said Katz.

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, September 22, 1988

Shuttle problem will not
thwart scheduled launch

BRIGHAM CITY, Utah (AP) —
An o|d—model nozzle inlet ring
was used in the final test of Mor-
ton Thiokol’s redesigned space
shuttle booster rocket, but NASA
doesn't believe the discovery will
delay next week's scheduled
shuttle launch, a spokesman said
Wednesday.

NASA spokesman Ed Medal
said it had not yet been deter-
mined if the outdated ring was
used in the two boosters attached
to the space shuttle Discovery,
scheduled for launch Sept. 29,
but preliminary investigation
showed it had not.

”There’s no indication that the
old configuration is in the
boosters (in Discovery). But
we've got to go ahead and check
the records and clear that,” Me-
dal said.

”We certainly don't believe the
situation will impact the launch,
though,” Medal said at NASA’s
Marshall Space Flight Center in
Huntsville, Ala., which oversees
the booster rocket contract.

Asked how the ring with the
old design might have been in-
stalled on the test rocket, he said,
”We’re taking a long, hard look

_at how the old ring got there.

One of the leading possibilities is
a cross labeling of parts.”

Medal said it is necessary to
check records because actually
searching through Discovery for
the ring would be too difficult.

”We are going through the
records and checking to clear the
boosters for flight. if one of the
old inlet rings was there, there
would be no safety issue for
flight. The old design worked per-
fectly well on all space shuttle
flights. The modification was a
very minor one,” Medal said.

The ring, located inside the
nozzle assembly at the tail of the
shuttle booster, was redesigned
for production models of the
solid rocket motors.

But for some reason the nozzle
installed in the Aug. 18 test
booster contained a ring of the
old, pre—Challenger design, Me-
dal said.

Toilets, stripteases, sex, and other cartoons

9

By John Berger

For The Pitt News

If you consider yourself to be
a man or a woman who is not
easily offended, then you may be
interested in checking out the
Outrageous Animation cartoon
festival at the Pittsburgh Play-
house, running from Sept. 23-31.

This collection of 22 animated
shorts is guaranteed to disturb
and revolt a larger percentage of
its audience than Monty Python's
The Meaning of Life, and to
offend the sensibilities of more
people than The Last Temptation
of Christ.

Wait, you say, but these mo-
vies were making important satir-
ical and/or philosophical points.
This is true, and some of these
short films do have points to
make. Not all of them. Some of
them have a biting humor that is
well worth any slight stomach up-
set that they might provoke, but
again, not all of them. In my opin-
ion, however, the festival is well
worth seeing for the ones that do.

The problem with reviewing
something like this is basically
that it is difficult to give a sense
of what some of the cartoons are
about without deadening their
impact. So if you feel that you
need more information than I'm
giving, you'll just have to ask
someone else who has seen it.
But I wouldn't want someone to
tell me the punchline until I've
heard the joke, and I'm keeping
the punchlines of these anima-
tions to myself.

”An InsideJob” is a hysterical-

. ly funny treatment of a trip to the

dentist, with most of the cartoon
shown from the point of view of
looking down the throat of the

; patient. lfyou didn’t hate and fear

dentists before this, you certain-
ly will afterward.

”Striptease” could be a lot of
fun, especially if you observe the
people around you, and compare
what you see with what is hap-
pening on screen.

In ”Vice Versa,” the viewer is

’ treated to one of the most spite-

fully satisfying cartoons ever, and
it's executed in a very solemn
manner, which adds to the hu-
mor of the actual act of revenge.
I know this is vague, but I really
can't tell you any more without
spoiling it.

If you saw The 20th Annual
Tournee of Animation, you may
remember a short called ’’Plus
One, Minus 1" which was done
by a man named Guido Manuli.

Step over (to) 

By Jeffrey Sullivan
Staff Writer

There is a thin blue line that
protects our society from chaos,
a thin blue line of police who
shield us from anarchy. When
someone breaks through this line,
breaks a link, our justice system
lashes out with more than its
usual fervor. When a cop gets
killed, as we know, many in the
penal system view it as more than
”just another murder.”

On the night of Nov. 28, I976,
in Dallas, Texas, a policeman
was murdered. Robert Wood ap-
proached a blue compact car that
he had just pulled over for driv-
ing without lights. As hevwalked
up to the driver’s window, he

was shot five times. He died on
the cold pavement moments
later.

Dallas police had almost no
leads on the killing from Wood's
partner, Teresa Turko, who wit-
nessed the entire incident and as
a result spent the better part of a
month in a futile search for
Woods killer. But for a fortuitous
arrest in nearby Vidor, Texas, the
case might never have been
cleared by arrest. '-

Sixteen-year—old David Harris
of Vidor, a juvenile delinquent,
had been bragging to friends that
he had killed a Dallas cop. A
search of the swamp behind his
house produced the murder
weapon, a .22 target pistol. The

Beasts of the East meet

in 1988 version of
”The Backyard Brawl”

By Vince Carey

Sports Editor

The Pitt Panthers and the West
Virginia Mountaineers are two
football teams heading in the
same direction, but taking differ-
ent paths to get there.

Pitt (ranked 16th by the As-
sociated Press) is using a mixture
of youthful exuberance and a
strong, experienced offensive line
(Tom Ricketts, Chris Goetz, Dean
Caliguire, Mark Stepnoski and
Roman Matusz) to get to the top.
West Virginia (No. 11), on the
other hand, is counting on their
experienced, older players (start-
ing 17 seniors) and a junior quar-
terback (Major Harris) to get
where they want to go.

Their paths will cross this week
at Pitt Stadium on Saturday at
12:10 p.m.

”Offensively, they [Pitt] are dy-
namite, and defensively they may
be a little better,” WVU coach
Don Nehlen said. ”I think Pitt
may be as good as anybody.”

West Virginia is expected to be
a power in the east this season,
mainly due to the play of Harris.

  

Through three games this sea-
son (Bowling Green, Cal State-
Fullerton and Maryland) the
Mountaineer offense has scored
162 points and amassed 1,595 to-
tal yards. In the same games, their
opponents have scored only 48
points and gained only 729
yards.

”West Virginia is very strong
and has a. lot of depth on their
football team,” Pitt coach Mike
Gottfried said. ”They are a very
veteran ballclub. I think 33 of
their 46 players are seniors. Our
players know that we have our
work cut out for us and that we
are going to have to work very
hard to win this football game.”

Pitt’s stats aren't as impressive
as WVU’s, but’ by no means are
they anything to laugh at. The
Panthers have put 101 points on
the board, holding Northern Iowa
and Ohio State to 10 apiece.
They have moved the ball for 975
yards while opponents stand at
304 yards.

The strength of the Pitt offense
is once again the running game,
with 708 yards to its credit.

. Stepnoski, Baumann at odds for the last time

3

 

   
    

By Matt Martin
Sports Editor

Pitt offensive lineman Mark
Stepnoski and West Virginia
place-kicker Charlie Baumann
have never been on the playing
field at the same time in their col-
legiate careers, yet they're rivals.

But, somewhat unexpectedly,
there is no hatred between these
members of the two rival teams.

There is only friendship.

They attended the same high
school — Erie Cathedral Prep —
and both contributed to the build-
ing of what is now a highly
regarded scholastic football pro-
gram in the state of Pennsylvania.

And this Saturday, they will
meet for the fourth and last time
of their college careers when
16th—ranked Pitt (2-0) takes on
11th-ranked WVU (3-0) at Pitt

Although the rivalry between
the Panthers and the Moun-
taineers is one of the most heat-
ed in the east, if not in the
country, Baumann said that the
relationship between himself and
”Steps” has not changed since
high school.

’’I don't think it's changed any.
All the time in the summer, we
go out, have a few laughs,” the
6—foot—1, 202—pound senior said.

Stepnoski, 6-3, 265, agrees. ’’It
just gives us something else in
common, playing for major foot-
ball programs. It gives us a lot
more to talk about.”

But what if Stepnoski were a
defensive lineman?

’’I think that would be kind of
neat, him out there trying to
block my kicks,” Baumann said.
”He’d probably wave at me or
something.”

Stepnoski, known for his work
ethic, has different ideas on this
topic, however. ’’If I was in that
position, ‘I would do everything
I could to do it. Personal feelings
have to take a back seat.”

High school was no different
for these two, either. Prep was
undefeated, Metro League cham-
pions and the third-ranked team

. in the state in their sophomore

season. A winning program, just
like Pitt and WVU.

Stepnoski was considered a
major college prospect from the
day he first walked through the
doors of Prep. ”Mark had his

mind made up for where he ’_
wanted to go to college in the

ninth or 10th grade, even though
he had choices” Baumann said.

But Baumann said he wasn't
sure where he would be going
until his senior year. ’’I didn’t
have the same chance to weigh

up here,” he added. g

The legacy they left under
Rambler head coach Mina Ge-
orge has continued in the past
few seasons. Prep is undefeated
so far this year and ranked third

hindsight now, Baumann said,

’’It just turned out that I ended

dling of communication between
Baumann and Stepnoski. Games,
pratice and classwork keep them
from staying better in touch. And
when this game is over, the next
time the two run into each other
may be in the summer of 1989.
Or the NFL. ’

Stepnoski has been deemed a
valuable pick in the upcoming
NFL draft. He is considered one

A of, if not the best offensive guard

in the country. L

Baumann has also been tagged
as a possible pick. in his four
years at West Virginia, he has
connected on 37 of 49 field goals
and 97 of 99, PATS.

. Baumann also had a field goal
of 55 yards in the 1987
Cold/Blue game, unofficially ty-
ing the school record.

’’If pro football comes my way,
I'll give it a shot,” Baumann said.
’’But I want to get my degree first.
l’|| graduate next December.”

Stepnoski has said that he
would like to play pro ball, and
it is likely nearly any team in the

 

NFL would like to have him

Academics have never been a
problem for Stepnoski. The high
school honor student was named
a GTE Academic All-American
his sophomore year, and he
maintains over a 3.0 grade point
average in his communications
major on his way to graduating
on schedule.

But in the meantime, Baumann
and » Stepnoski have this
weekend's game to worry about.

A A Pitt win would put the Panthers

over the hump of the toughest
part of their schedule and move
them up in the rankings. A WVU
victory could propel the Moun-
taineers into the Top 10 and have
major bowl scouts drooling.

’’I wouldn't favor anybody.
Both teams have shown their
worth early in the season,” Bau—
mann said.

"’lf’s definitely a big game,”
Stepnoski said. ”The rivalry will
be even more intense because of
records and rankings.”

THE PITT NEWS, Thursday, September 22, T988‘

Liggins’ past experiences mix well with Pitt

by Chris Bosak

Staff Writer

Although he admits he now
looks more like a pulling guard,
Pitt running back coach Tommy
Liggins was considered a great
back in his high school and col-
lege football career.

3 Liggins turned to coaching af-

W But if you want to see the best '
game of the week in person, then ,

ter he destroyed his knee on the
field in his senior year at the
University of Cincinnati.

”l knew my playing days were
over then,” said Liggins, referring
to the hit that crushed his knee.

So, in‘1975, Liggins hung up
his cleats and took the job of
strength coach at the University
of Arizona. In the same year, an
assistant coach from Liggins’
playing days at the University of
Cincinnati also made his way
west to coach at Arizona.

That coach's name? Mike Gott-

fried, now Pitt head football
coach. The two have been
together ever since.

’’I admire him not only as a
football coach but also as a per-
son. He has a tremendous
loyalty, which is a key compo-
nent to any friendship,” said
Gottfried about Liggins.

Liggins also served under Gott-
fried as running back coach at
Murray State, the University of
Cincinnati and the University of

V Kansas.

Gottfried said Liggins plays an
important role on the Panther
squad. He has become more than
just a coach to the players, and
Gottfried admires the relation-
ships Liggins builds with his
athletes. .

”He’s great with the players.
He has a special ability to warm

I up to somebody and have some-

body warm up to him,” said

Pitt, WVU contest may
be highlight of weekend
full of fantastic football

If you could watch only one
game this weekend, which one
would itgbe? Oklahoma vs. USC?

. No. 3 against No. 5 — a good

choice. How about LSU and
Ohio State? The Tigers just blew
out Tennessee and are ranked
seventh, while OSU has some-
thing to prove at home after last
week's destruction by Pitt —
another good game.

head to Pitt Stadium and catch
the 1988 version of The Backyard
Brawl. ,

Because of the performances
turned in by Pitt and West Vir-

VINCE
LONGO

ginia last week, it would be an in-

T sult to your collective sports

intelligence to hype this game.
This one needs no buildup, par-
ticularly from the Mountaineers’

' point of view. lfthe ’Eers can get

past Pitt —— their biggest obstacle
—- then the only remaining seri-
ous threats on their schedule will
be Penn State and Syracuse, and
both of those games will be
played in Morgantown. If WVU
wins this game, then Beano
Cook, who picked West Virginia
as his No. 1 team, just may end

_up‘looking like a genius.

Last week — 4-2 (.667)

For the year — 22-6 (.786)

Syracuse-28, Virginia Tech-10

The Syracuse team that got
thumped by Ohio State is not the
real Syracuse team. The Orange-
men will be 4-1 heading into
their Oct. 15 showdown with
Penn State.

Colorado-20, Oregon State-3

With a few breaks, the Buffs
could challenge for second place
in the Big Eight.

Pitt-17, West Virginia-14

‘Everybody knows that games
which should be offensive shows
turn into defensive struggles.
Both teams will be tight for this
one. One thing seems certain: It
will not be a blowout, either way.

Penn State-29, Rutgers-7

Gottfried.

Liggins, a former A||—State run-
ning back from Fremont Ross
High School in Ohio, is in his
third year on the Pitt coaching

 

Tommie Liggins

staff. But his strategies and tech-
niques for motivating his players
have not changed withhis cross-
country travels.

’’I just try to do the best I can.

I treat all my running backs the
same,” said Liggins.

Liggins said that Pitt is different
from other football schools in
many ways, though. He is most
impressed with the tradition and
the loyalty people have to Pitt.

”When people graduate from
other colleges, they tend to for-
get about the school. But that’s
not the case with Pitt. They have
a certain loyalty here.”

Liggins said the reason that Pitt
has quality running backs year—in
and year—out is the reputation and
tradition Pitt has for running
backs. He said recruiting the best
running backs around the coun-
try is made easier by this public
tradition.

And who could argue with
that? Pitt has produced such rush-
ing phenomena as Craig Hey-
ward, Randy McMillan, Elliott

Walker and, of course, Tony
Dorsett. V _

”When guys watch someone
like Dorsett, they have a dream
to be like that some day,” said
Liggins.

Liggins pointed out that coach-
ing a back with natural talent and
natural instinct doesn't make his
job easier. He said there are ’’lit-
tle things” great backs out of high
school must learn. ’

”At college, it's all football.
Technique is a hard thing to teach
backs, showing them the right
way to read blocks and so forth.

’’I just want my backs to be pre-
pared. When they do a good job,
it shows that we [coaches] are do-
ing our job,” Liggins said.

And how long will Liggins
coach at Pitt?

”As long as they want me,” he
said.

”Last year, I think that Pitt was
a little one-dimensional,” Nehlen
said. ”Last year they had the great
back and not the great quarter-
back. Now, this year, they have
the great quarterback and the
solid back. They're doing
everything.”

Last season, Pitt was able to sal-
vage a 6-3 defensive battle at
Morgantown. ,

This year, offenses will be the
focus of the game. Both run the
option and have strong quarter-
backs (Harris and Pitt's Darnell
Dickerson) who have similar ath-
letic: ability and can put points on
the board.

”They have a great team,”
Dickerson said. ”But we do, too.
1 think their defense is a little
quicker than any other team we
faced this season, and that could
cause us a little trouble. Their op-
tion is running pretty good. I have
confidence that our defense can
keep them down.” 6

’’I think if we can contain

ity to spread the defense all over

As far as the Pitt offense goes,
they haven't been running the
option as much or as long as
WVU, but Gottfried feels he has
a good thing going.

”Our offensive scheme is run-
ning well. There is no reason to
change it.”

”The key for us to win any

-game is keeping our defense off

the field,” Matusz said. ’’In the
first two games, we have had the
ball longer than our opponent. If
we can keep the ball and let our
defense get some rest, it should
be a good game.”

Wide receiver Henry Tuten
concurs.‘

 
  
  

   
  

”We are a confident team right
now. We know this is a big game
and the better team will win.”

With all this talk about offense,
the game is expected to be high-
scoring. Nehlen isn't so sure.

”Both teams are a little more
mature this season. I don't think
another 6-3 game is very likely,”
Nehlen said. ”lt’s not going to be
50-40 either. To tell you the truth,
I don't know from one day or
another how my team is going
to do, let alone Pitt's team.

’’I don't think anybody’s going
to score a whole lot of points on
Pitt. So when you play them, you
have to figure out some way to
keep those guys down. Some-
body might score some points,
but I don't think it's going to be
nine billion, that's for sure.”

With national rankings on the
line and major bowl representa-
tives in attendance, no fans
should leave Pitt Stadium disap-

ing a 9-4 overall edge.

LOOKING AHEAD
Boston College

Pitt travels to Boston College to take on the BC Eagles in a
Major lndependent matchup next week. ,

Boston College features an unexpected quarterback in senior
Mark Kamphaus, who replaced expected starter Mike Power
after a season-opening loss to USC.

Kamphaus completed 23 of 41 passes for 256 yards and three
touchdowns in 1987 and threw two interceptions.

Fifth-year senior tailbackjim Bell is featured in the backfield.
Bell became BC’s seventh 1,000-yard rusher last season, finish-
ing with 1,015 yards and three rushing touchdowns, as well
as 182 yards and one touchdown through the air.

He rushed for 139 yards against the Panthers last year, the
second most the fourth-ranked Pitt defense allowed.

Defensively, the Eagles will throw fifth—year senior cornerback
Steve Williams at the Panthers. Williams has intercepted six
passes in the past two seasons.

Safety Ed Duran, the team's leading returning tackler (1 10 in
1987) will also put pressure on the Panther offense, backed by
defensive end Kevin Pearson (102 tackles, two sacks). Former
All-East defensive end Eric Lindstrom will be counted on as well.

The Eagles have a potentially dangerous weapon in place-
kicker Brian Lowe, who has connected on 28 of 39 field goal
attempts and is in the midst of a 39-game PAT streak.

Boston sports three potential Al|—Americans in Bell, wide
receiver Tom Waddle and offensive guard Joe Wolf.

The Eagles have won the past two meetings, with Pitt hold-

BC is at Texas Christian this weekend.

selves after an 0-2 start, but the
Seminoles are on a roll. You can
take this one to the bank, and it
may not even be this close.

Upset of the Week
Tennessee-20, Auburn-19

Normally, this would not be
much of an upset. But Tennessee
is 0-3 after getting blasted by LSU,
34-9, and Auburn is ranked
seventh in the nation after a 56-7
thrashing of Kansas. The game is
being played at Auburn. Believe
me, this is a major upset.

Miami-51, Wisconsin-7

The Badgers lost last week to
some school called Northern ll-
linois. We know how Jimmy
Johnson loves to run up the score.

LSU-21, Ohio State-14

Though Georgia and Auburn
are ranked ahead of them, LSU
may be the best team in the na-
tion's best conference, the SEC.
However, a killer schedule will
probably prevent them from go-
ing to the Sugar Bowl.

Southern Cal-33, Oklahoma-V21

Somewhat of a mild upset, if you look
at the odds on the game. Oklahoma is fa-
vored by one and a half, but the Sooners
are overrated and maybe undeserving of
their No. 3 national ranking.

Indiana-37, Missouri-28

Though they were 8-4 last year, includ-
ing wins over Ohio State and Michigan,
the Hoosiers still are not taken seriously.
That's understandable, though. One sea-
son does not make a program.

House of Games is full of psychological suspence

qvtatthew Myers

For The Pitt News

”Dark places are necessary to
transact a dark business.”

Ah, the code of ethics in con ar-
tistry. lt’s the essence of the mys-
terious and dangerous con-
fidence man, an individual so
.manipulative and alluring, he
‘could probably talk Edye Tarbox
into returning to VH-1. But in
filmmaking, these seedy and
sinister joints of jocundity are fl'(;‘-
quently employed to serve as
backgrounds for movies of the
self-proclaimed, often-misused

film noir genre, but in House of
Games the categorization is right
on target.

Pulitzer-prize winning Chicago
playwright David Mamet makes
his directorial debut with House
of Games, an intriguing psycho-
logical thriller where nothing is as
it appears to be. Taut with sus-
pense, romance, and the power
of deception, this unusual film
has been acclaimed as one of the
best films of 1987, and it is a
recognition that's well deserved.

Not only are first-time director
and cast remarkably competent
in combination, but the picture it-

Pat Transit: Jam Alternative

lt’s an action—packed weekend for local mus-
ic. Probably two of the more prominent shows
are the Return of the Sponges on Friday, and The
Affordable Floors on Saturday, both shows at the
Graffiti.

The Sponges have just recently returned from
a recording session for their CD in Florida. Once
upon a time, the Sponges were one of Pittsburgh's
top acts, but they drifted slightly during their
break  now they're back with two new mem-
bers and organized under AKULA Mgt. (which
sources say to be Fusebox’s new management).

In the new releases department three bands
are just now finishing up their own; Deadly by
Desire (pictured left), Fusebox and Permanent
Wink.

if you missed either of the Alternative jams
earlier in the month, never fear  word is that
a third is in the works. The Jams feature five talent-
ed groups for free, the idea being to expose the
audience to bands they’ve probably never seen
without endangering their pocketbook. Follow-
ing a similar theme, Rock Bash 1 at the Foundry

and be open to all ages.

On the national front, rumor has it that three
bands are now being considered to play the
’burgh  Camper van Beethoven, Cocteau
Twins, and the Sugarcubes. We'll keep you
posted.

The Foundry, the Strip’s converted brass facto-
ry, was the subject of much gossip this week.
Saturday night police visited the Carsickness
show and, noticing that money was being col-
lected at the door, all of which goes to pay the
bands, decided that the Foundry is a business and
that they were operating without some sort of
piece of bureaucratic paper. Manny Theiner,
alternative-scene Renaissance man, still plans on
opening the upcoming shows. Still a new place,
the Foundry, with its crane beams and hooks still
intact, is a godsend for Pittsburgh: an all ages
venue for alternative local and national bands.
I guess that makes Manny a god.

That's all for now; see ya at the shows.

Continued from page 9.

Manuli also contributes to Outra-
geous Animation with a film
called ”Erection.”

This is one of the longest car-
toons (more than five minutes
long), and it contains a ’’film
within a film” segment. The title
should give you some idea about
the content. This is one of the ani-
mations with some satirical (if I
dare use the word) point, which
makes it, in my opinion, one of
the better films.

If this sort of content is unim-
prefer one of the others in the ser-

ments” or ”Another Great
Moment,” which go for the gross-
out humor without any particular
substance.

”Erection” leads me to two
other films, with elements com-
mon to it, but not to each other.

The first one is ”One of Those
Days.” This cartoon is also by an
animator whose work appeared
in the Tournee of Animation, Bill
Plympton. . His previously
screened film was called ”Your
Face,” and it was a light-hearted

singing the song ”Your Face”
while very strange things hap-
pened to his.

”One of Those Days” is a
somewhat more perverse cartoon
about a man having one of those
days, but it still retains an inoffen-
sive droll quality comparable to
that of the other short.

The other film that I can relate
to ”Erection” is called ”Rondi-
no,” made by Hungarian anima-
tor Csaba Szorady. This, like
”Erection,” is a cartoon with a
point, which doesn't fully register
until the last few seconds of the
film. It is extremely well-executed
and. well-animated. It is my
favorite animation out of the
whole collection.

There are others; I won't try to
address them all. They vary from
tastelessly funny to just tasteless,
and if you go in for sophomoric
dirty humor, then they are all fun-
ny. But even if you don’t, the
ones that are a little more grown-
up make it more than worthwhile
to sit through the rest. if you have
the stomach for it, go see Outra-
geous Animation. It is a good
way to spend an hour and a half.

Continued from page 19.
smooth-talking con artist (Joe
Mantegna).

It all begins when one of her
patients, a compulsive gambler,
is threatened by a compelling con
man named Mike (played by bad
man Mantegna). Ford, whose life
is dull and uninteresting, be-
comes the victim of an elaborate
gm game.

As she seeks to remain in con-
trol of her own destiny, she is in-
creasingly fascinated by the con
man's charm, allured by his dark,
exotic life and entwined in his
brilliant scam, from which there
is no escape. Her secure world of
self—motivation slowly begins to
decay, deeply involving her in
deceit and, eventually, violence.

To presuppose that House of
Games is Hitchcockian may be a
typical convention, but the film
certainly has elements that are

I reminiscent of the Master's own

tales of suspense. In fact, with its
contemporary style and dialogue,
one could say it is very ”neo—
Hitchcockian”.

Mamet’s characters are striking
contrasts of each other, dynamic
and convincing illustrations of
clever vs. naive. Mike may be a
criminal, but he is one colorful

bad guy, an aggressive loner hero .

who creates his own philosophy
to survive: ”We’ve all got to live
in an imperfect world.”

Ford, on the other hand, is life-
less, flat, and certainly boring -
definitely someone you wouldn't
want to take on a pig hunt. She
is enchanted by the romantic life
of the confidence man, and it is
precisely the ”confidence” she
gives to Mike that makes her fall
prey to his games.

House of Games is more than
an intriguing thriller, it's an in-
volving picture, aesthetically. It is
a breathless roller-coaster ride of

a movie that keeps springing one
bizarre surprise after another, sus-
taining suspense with dazzling
audacity while luring the un-
suspecting audience into a psy-
chological and moral thicket of
troubling implications which
bear the unmistakable imprint of
Mamet’s intensely personal
vision.

Among other things, it makes
a bold statement about the de-
ceptive and complex profession
of psychiatry. In one scene, Ford
tells her colleague, ’’I know why
she is in the hospital, she's sick.
The question is what am I doing
there. It's a sham, it's a con game.
There's nothing I can do to help
her, and there's nothing I can
learn from her to help others
avoid her mistakes.”

Ford's weakness as a victim
and as a psychiatrist is played ex-
cellently by Crouse, whose stat-
ic portrayal is a marvelous

contrast to Mantegna’s con artist.
Both actors are superb in their
performance, controlling the at-
tention on screen at all times.

The real irony of the whole sto-
ry is that this incredibly success-
ful, best—selling author cannot
assert herself to control her des-
tiny or find pleasure in her own
lifestyle.

There is also a hint at possible
mental deficiencies in her charac-
ter, particularly in the frequent
use of malapropisms she uses in
conversation which, incidentally,
cause her some major problems
towards the end.

House of Games is Mamet’s
first film as director, but the na-
tion's leading American play-
wright has contributed to the
screen such wonderful scripts as
The Postman Always Rings
Twice and The Verdict (for which
he won an ‘Oscar nomination).

His stageplays are outstanding

plays of character and at-
mosphere as well, most notably,
Clengarry Glen Ross, for which
he won the Pulitzer, American
Buffolo and Sexual Perversity in
Chicago, which Mamet adapted
to the screen in the film About
Last, Night 

House of Games marks a new
venture for the successful
playwright and his wife of 10
years, Lindsay Crouse, It also
represents a willing departure
from the theater.

’’It was like a whole new aspect
of life opened up for me. I
remember thinking how very sad
that this feeling [of camaraderie]
is absent from the theater, where
no one is guaranteed employ-
ment from one year to the next;
where this year's istar writer, ac-
tor, designer, may not work again
for years; and I remember feeling
grateful that I could feel that
camaraderie‘ again.”

blue compact car had been sto-
len and later abandoned by Har-
ris in Vidor.

When Harris arrived in Dallas,
however, he changed his tune.
He claimed that a hitchhiker he

ﬁsad picked up, Randall Dale
Adams, was responsible for the
slaying. He claimed he was just
trying to impress his friends with
his talk of cop-killing.

Despite Harris’ lengthy crimi-
nal record including violent
crimes, and the facts that Adams
denied committing the crime,
had no criminal record and no
history of violence, Harris was
released, and Adams detained.

On the strength of Harris’ tes-
timony and that of several dubi-
ous eyewitnesses, Adams was
convicted of the murder and sen-
tenced to death in the electric
chair. Throughout his entire hear-
'ng and jail term, and to this day,

dams has professed his in-
nocence. I

Errol Morris, director of The
Thin Blue Line, was working as
a private investigator in New
York when he first encountered
the Adams case through an inves-
tigation of Dr. James Crigson
(”Dr. Death”), a Dallas psy-
chiatrist known for his record of
sending convicted killers to death
tow by his consistently damning
testimony. Grigson’s testimony in
the Adams case resulted in
Adams’ getting the death sen-
tence instead of life in prison.

When Morris interviewed
Adams as part of his research on
Grigson, he was unimpressed. ”I
wasn't concerned with the issue
of their guilt or innocence,” he
explained, ”only with Grigson’s
predictions about their behavior.

 assumed they were all guilty.”

But after reading the court tran-
script of Adams’ trial in 1977,
Morris was left with many unan-
swered questions. _

The result of his questioning is
The Thin Blue Line, a non-fiction
feature which claims to solve the
real—life mystery of police officer
Robert Woods and further asserts
that the wrong man was convict-
gd of the crime.

Adams’ sentence was commut-
ed to life in prison, and more re-
cently, a request for a retrial has
been blocked by a Dallas judge.

See for yourself whether you
think Adams received a fair trial,
or whether he was framed. As
Harris put it in his final interview,
”Heard of the proverbial

scapegoat?” I have, and maybe,
just maybe, his name is Randall

Health Service comes under scrutiny

By Timothy Robinson
For The Pitt News

The University of Pittsburgh
Student Health Service, located
in Brackenridge Hall, is one of
the more comprehensive sources
of health care in Oakland.
Although the quality of services
is judged to be superior by the
medical community, Pitt students
have generally taken an apathet-
ic attitude toward using them.

SHS Administrator Franklin
Carter says that it is because
”most students act like the gener-
al population when it comes to
health care — unless there is
something specifically wrong,
they don't bother using the
service.”

From the standpoint of preven-
tive health care, lack of student
participation is a great loss. SHS

has created a ”Healthy Lifestyles —

Programs” operated by the
Health Education Office in Hol-
land Hall. Shirley Haberman
serves as the program director.
”Lifesty|es” offers counseling
for stress management, nutrition,
substance abuse, weight control

and sexual health care, including
birth control.

These services are valuable
tools in surviving tough academ-
ic years at the university. One au-
diovisual presentation, ”Cocaine:
A Deadly Elective,” recently won
an award from the Health Educa-
tion Center of Blue Cross of
Western Pennsylvania. It is in the
process of being distributed to
high schools throughout Alleghe-
ny County.

In addition to health education,
the Health Service also provides
clinical services to students. The
clinical service unit receives
about 35,000 visits annually for
general medical care, ambulato-
ry surgery, treatment for allergy

infections, dermatology and
prescriptions from an on-site
pharmacy.

Carter said that SHS ”provides
the student with a broad range of
services that is well worth the fee
charged and that is well delivered
by the medical staf .” There are
specialty practitioners who work
for the service on a contractual
basis from the Falk Clinic, Forbes
Clinic, University Surgical As-
sociates and private practices in
Oakland.

In spite of all the strengths of
the clinic, some students are not
satisfied with the individual care
they receive. Pitt seniors Howard
Forman and Barb Clawson feel

that they are not getting as much
as they hoped to get out of the
service. ’ A

Forman believes that the ac-
curacy of the diagnosis for his
medical problem was incorrect
and that the provision of emer-
gency medical services is lacking.

Clawson said, ’’Unless you
have a scheduled appointment,
you often have to come back two
or three times as a walk-in.” The
hectic pace most studentskeep
doesn't lend itself well to this sit-
uation. _

Carter defends the SHS by
pointing out that there is a good

system of emergency referral with
Presbyterian-University Hospital
and the other hospitals on cam-
pus. The SHS is staffed with four
full-time physicians and three
nurse practitioners whom he feels
are more than qualified to treat
any pertinent health problems.
Pitt is unique in its provision of
care on a full-time basis. The
other universities in Pittsburgh,
like Carnegie Mellon and Du-
quesne, do not have such a large-
scale plan. Since students are per-
mitted an unlimited number of
visits at SHS, it is difficult to ac-
commodate everyone’s schedule.
Walk-ins must take their chances.

’’I think that the Student Health
Service does a lot for our stu-
dents,” said Carter. ”The main
objective we must have is to im-
prove communication between
us and them.”

Questionnaires are one way to
bridge this gap between students
and physicians. Unfortunately,
Carter reports that most students
do not respond to the question-
naires distributed. ”Once they
have received the care they need,
they dash off to go about their
business. H

Surveys are currently distribut-
ed at the Forbes Clinic and on a
random basis from the SHS itself.

Strategic arms placement

stalls super-powers talks”

By Bryan Brumley

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON (AP) — U.S.
officials expect little progress in
arms control talks Thursday be-
tween Soviet Foreign Minister
Eduard A. Shevardnadze and
President Reagan, in large part
because the administration and
Congress cannot agree on what
strategic weapons to deploy in
the future.

”We certainly know we can't
finish the START [Strategic Arms
Reduction Talks] treaty this year,”
Assistant Secretary of State
Rozanne Ridgway told a congres-
sional panel Tuesday.

The U.S. presidential election
makes it hard to hammer out the
incredibly complex details of a
START agreement during Rea-
gan's remaining four months in
office, particularly the inspection
regimes needed to verify pro-
posed 30 percent to 50 percent
cuts in strategic weapons
systems. ,

Besides the devilish details,
however, the United States has
reached an impasse in its own
strategic planning that vastly
complicates efforts to conclude
an arms control treaty, an agree-
ment that would govern the
deployment of American forces
for decades.

Shevardnadze, who was arriv-
ing Wednesday afternoon, was to
meet Thursday with Reagan,

Secretary of State George Shultz
and Vice President George Bush.

The talks, say U.S. officials, will
concentrate mainly on the non-
arms aspects of the administra-
tion’s four-point agenda: bilater-...
al relations, human rights and
multilateral issues such as the
withdrawal of Soviet troops from
Afghanistan and Cuban troops
from Angola.

Reagan and Soviet leader Mik-
hail S. Gorbachev made little
progress on arms control at the
June summit in Moscow, and
movement will probably be slow
well into the next administration,
according to many observers in
the administration and on Capitol

Hill. 

The three key stumbling blocks
are the Star Wars program to de-
velop |and—and—space-based anti-
missile weapons, the develop-
ment and deployment of mobile
intercontinental ballistic missiles
(ICBMs), and whether to control
submarine-launched cruise mis-
siles (SLCMs).

The Soviets oppose a START

deal without a U.S. commitment ‘
that Star Wars research will not
break the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Mis-
sile treaty for a set period of time,
probably eight to 10 years.“

The Soviets also want the Unit-
ed States to agree to a limit on
nuclear-tipped submarine-
Iaunched cruise missiles, above

the overall 6,000-warhead limit‘ I

agreed upon in the proposed
START treaty. '

On the third major issue, the
United States is pressing for a ban
on all ground—launched mobile
|CBMs, which would require the
Soviets to dismantle their already
deployed SS-24 and SS—25 mo-
bile missiles.

The United States has not

decided whether or how to‘

deploy a mobile missile. The ad-
ministration and Congress are
sparring on whether to develop
a I0—warhead rai|—mobiIe MX
missile, similar to the Soviet

SS-24, or a single-warhead road— V

mobile Midgetman, similar to the
Soviet SS-25.

Reagan vetoed Congress’
defense authorization bill for the
fiscal year beginning Oct. 1 in
part because it provided only
about $4 billion for Star Wars vs.
the administration request of $4.8
billion, and because Congress in-
sisted that Star Wars tests not vio-
late the ABM pact.

The potential conflict between
the ABM treaty and Star Wars,
formally known as the Strategic
Defense Initiative or SDI, has
dominated public discussion of
arms control for years.

But it may be diverting atten-
tion from other crucial issues.

Even SDI advocates such as form— ._,,

er White House national securi-
ty adviser Robert McFarIane
acknowledge that ”we do not
know and cannot know for the
next IO or 15 years” whether
SDI’s ”defensive technologies
provide the means to defend us
against ballistic missiles.”

Campus in need of

a few more phones

If Shakespeare were writing a play for the Pitt theater depart-
ment on the life of Wesley Posvar, he might find it apropos
to include the following line: A phone, a phone, my campus

for a phone.

If there's one thing that Posvar’s campus of the future is lack-
ing, it’s on-campus phones accessible to students. Outside of
the residence halls, there are only two phones that students
can use to contact other on-campus buildings. Students who
are not in either the William Pitt Union or Hillman Library will
have to makea trip to one of them if they are going to contact
other students without having to deposit 25 cents into a pay

phone.

It is absolutely moronic of the university to not have campus
phones in each of its buildings, regardless of the alleged cost
factor that would fall on thejdepartments housed in the build-

ings. Student Government Board member Kyle Durham believes

that cost is the main reason that university departments balk
at the idea of installing phones. Cost, however, is not an ade-

quate excuse.

If the individual departments will not take the responsibility
of providing students who use the buildings with the means
of contacting other students, then some other part of the univer-
sity should. It is reprehensible to think that the world's second
largest university building — the Cathedral of Learning — has
only pay phones to offer its students.

After my return to Pitt, acuri-
ous and terrible thing happened.
I awoke one morning and disco-
vered, to my horror, that I was no
longer a happy undergraduate. I
looked in the mirror and saw, the
scowl of a surly senior.

You are surely familiar with the
species. After all, a surly senior is
easy to spot. She will refuse, on
principle, to buy her books until
the bookstore has been complete-
ly cleared of scummy underclass-
men (this happens about the third

What it’s like waking up and

Waking up can sometimes be
scary. Oh, not the physical kind
of scary such as the one exhibit-
ed by those who have consumed
far too much liquor the night be-
fore, but the type of scary that is
best experienced by opening
your eyes in a hospital in a neck
brace with no memory of how
you got there. It's true, it can hap-
pen in this technically advanced
age of Scotch tape and lube jobs

. in 15 minutes —— it happened to

me.

Memory is a strange thing to
lose, since you never really have
it in the first place. It's just sort of
there. It's one of those things you
really don't think about until you
lose it. It's intangible and elusive
— something like the fabled ”eu—
phoric buzz” so many have
searched for but never achieved.

So, sometime around eight
Sunday morning, I struggled out
of the interminable hole of sleep
to find myself in the position
described above. My first reac-
tion was that I’d missed a week
of classes. Somehow, in my
deluded sense of time, I accept-
ed I’d slept a week as if it were
a wink; yet I still believed it was
the weekend. Don't ask me why.
Then, realizing that I couldn’t do
anything even remotely construc-

tive — like go to the bathroom -
from my horizontal position, I
promptly fell back asleep.

The next thing I know, the pa-
tient in the bed next to me was
moaning, ”The pressure! The

. pressure!” to a group of people

around his bed. Actually, there
may have been only one doctor
imitating a lot of people, since the
pseudo—walls were put up. I fell
asleep again.

That's another thing which has
bothered me to no end: the fact
that I could sleep while part of
my life was erased in my mind.
I guess curiousity is only good as
long as your body will let you
wonder — sort of the ”feed the
muscles before the mind” logic.

So I slept until a doctor tapped
me on the shoulder and asked me
a few questions. The first few I
really don't remember. I suppose
they went to the same place the
rest of my lost memory went. But
he did ask me to remember three
things for him. One was a Cadil-
lac, the second was a red rubber
ball and the last was a cloud.

He came back a bit later and
asked me to repeat the three
items. For some strange reason,
I could only remember the Cad-
dy. This is quite strange to me,
since I really hate big, obtuse cars

like that. Maybe I can rub my
chin and use the old dream
watcher’s excuse, ”Definitely
Freudian,” when I remember that
in the future. Maybe not.

Then the next couple of hours
were a sort of collage of x—rays
and CAT scans and lots of ceil-
ings going by since I was still ly-

ing down. By this time, you'd
think I'd have some knowledge
of the date, or even the football
game I had been to the night be-
fore. Nothin’ doin’, as some fa-
mous tough guy used to say,
although I still didn't think it was
the next weekend, I had it pegged
at around Tuesday or so.

Then they took me up to my
room. It wasn't that bad, and I fi-
nally knew what day it was, since
there was a rip—off calendar hang-
ing on the wall which said, ”To—
day Is: September 17/18.” This
set my mind at ease, but not that
much since I had no idea when
my last memory was. I remem-
bered my sister’s birthday was the
12th, but I didn't remember if I
sent her anything and wished her
well or not. Then I went to sleep

week into the term). It doesn't
matter anyway — she won't open
them until finals. No new note-
books, pencils or backpacks for
the senior. She justs rips the used
pages out of whatever she has_ left
from last year and stuffs the tat-
tered result into an equally
decrepit plastic bag from Giant
Eagle. Get a good night's sleep
before first day of classes? Not
our senior. She bar-hops the night
before, and shows up to class (if
she shows up at all) wearing the
remains of a hangover and
whatever looked relatively clean
on her floor 10 minutes before
she left.

Another sure-fire guide to
senior—spotting is certain pro-
found declarations that she spits
outat regular intervals. ’’It never
used to be like this,” ’’This
university is becoming a police
state” and ”Where did all these
freshmen come from?” are
among the most common bleats
you will hear.

pathetic breed, but we do have
an advantage over all you con-
fused freshmen, sophomores. and
juniors. We know exactly what
we want to do. We want to
graduate on time, and we want to
get out of here. Personally, my
only raison d’etre is the goal of
graduating on time. No matter
the question, my reply is always
”Graduate on time.” What do
you want for dinner, Shona? To
graduate on time. If the whole
world blows up on April 30, I

won't care -— just as long as it-

blows up after I have graduated.
On time.
So, if you see a girl stomping

around campus, looking like a ,

leftover from a ‘Mitchell's bar-
room brawl, muttering ferocious-
ly to herself and looking at her
watch like the White Rabbit from
Alice in Wonderland, be,kind to
her. Approach her slowly, give
her encouragement and cookies,
be nice. Don't ever laugh at her.

again.

A little later a nurse came in the
room and ran me through a few
tests to see if I was brain-
damaged. She had- me close my
eyes and hold my hands up like
lwas the recipient of a high-five;
she had me squeeze on her first
two fingers; she had me pull her
hands toward me, then push
them away from me; she asked
me the date, which I thought kind
of silly since it was still up on the
wall; and she held my feet and
told me to pull them toward me,
then push toward her. It was a
tremendous amount of fun, and
it was done once every shift.

As the first nurse was leaving,
she said.my parents called and
wanted me to call them back. I
was about to ask her how to call
out of my room, but the phone
rang, and of course it was my par-
ents. Something happened right
that day.

Through them, I finally figured’
out what had happened to me. I'd
been a_ victim of the famous 6th
Floor Water Slide, which consists
of dousing the hall of the Carlow
dorm with water, taking off your
shoes, and running like a mad-
man for the water. The expected
result is sort of like ice skating but
with no control. It looks like a

fantastic amount of fun, and I sup-
pose it is.

Sometime Sunday morning,
around four, I tried it. And due to
my natural lack of agility, my feet
went up and my head went back,
hard. Everybody who was there
said I laid in the water like I was
dead, and when they tried to pick
me up, I really couldn’t walk. I
also couldn’t remember anything.

We didn't talk long on the
phone; I guess they wanted me to
get some rest. About an hour af-
ter that, I got some visitors, the
guys from the sixth floor. Wow.
If you're ever wondered whether
or not to visit someone in the
hospital, do it. It just (quite liter-
ally) brightened my day. Even the
Steelers’ loss couldn’t bring me
down.

I feel really bad about one
thing, though, the fact that I
couldn’t remember any of their
names except Paul's. Just last
night, I was talking to a girl, and
she seemed extremely familiar,
but I couldn’t remember her
name. At all. I was so helpless, a
prisoner of some four lost hours.
Her voice and face were familiar,
just her name was gone.

fore. An experience from which
I can say I truly got an education
and of which I am appreciative.

Lately, there has been a sharp-
er focus on why we should

. respect our elders to a greater ex-

tent than what we have tradition-
ally. This summer, as I worked in
a geriatric center, I really came to
understand why. ‘
The 62 female patients that I
"worked with this summer were
all from very different back-
grounds, but all needed medical
attention of some sort since they
were not completely ”in their
right mind,” nor were they able-
bodied.
There were times when they'd
fight over television stations -

' Sesame Street or Oprah Winfrey.

There were other times when
"they'd babble and babble over
the strangest things -— bringing
the children in out of the rain, the
drought in Virginia in 1911 that
-dried up all the bean plants, the
nice girl that came to see them
every day when they lived at
home. Sometimes you could
have sworn they were talking

Whoever said the news was
boring? Yesterday, I paged
through The Pittsburgh Press and
found an interesting piece of in-
formation at the end of the
paper's ”National Roundup.” _

The three-inch story reported a
Florida first—grader who pulled a
gun on two of his female class-

~ mates and demanded sex.

The kid is seven years old and

I is facing a possible two-year sus-

pension from school. He told
police that he took the gun from
home. -
The story seems like a skit fro
David Letterman. I couldn't help
laughing a little when Iread it.
The incident isn't ‘supposed to

— be funny. However,‘ laughing is

a natural way of dealing with it.
It's, unsettling to think that first-
graders are capable of rape and

. murder.

Many people, including the
girls’ parents, aren't-laughing. For

Violence

A 19-year-old boy from the Bronx
was stabbed to death last week at
a rap concert on Long Island,
N.Y. It was the latest incident in
a growing number of violent acts
that are occurring around the

country where heavy metal and I

rock bands perform.

The Nassau County police
were prepared for the worst at
that concert. They set up elec-
tronic devices to screen the
10,000 concert goers for
weapons. Even so, police said a
number of knives and pistols ap-
parently were smuggled into the
event. In all, eight people were
stabbed — two critically — and
four were beaten or kicked.

In reporting the story, The New
York Times said, ”The slaying
and other violence was the latest
in a wave that seems to follow
rap performances  Although ar-
tists and promoters of rap music

purpose in mind. If you started to
walk away, though, they'd just
look to the ceiling and keep on
talking. Their minds went at un-
controllably high speeds without
any rhyme or reason. You could
hear the same exact story many
times because they had no
recollection of whether they had
ever told you about this specific
incident before.

Working with these people on
a day—to—day basis may sound like
a horrible job, but in actuality,
and in the right perspective, this
was the best job I think I've ever
had.

I learned a lot about so many
different things this summer —

these people, the situation is frus-
trating. Who do you blame? It
would be a lot easier if the kid
had waited until. his 18th
birthday. I

I kind-of feel sorry for the kid
when I think about what's in store

for him. Most likely, he will be

suspended, sent to several psy-
chiatrists and be watched careful-
ly by his teachers -for the
remainder of his childhood.

Some people will claim that his
age is an acceptableexplanation
for his actions. What does a
7-year-old know about life and
death? Then again, how does a
7-year-old know about sex?
Maybe he was only joking.

I can't recall being interested in
girls when I was 7-years—o|d.
They weren't very good athletes,
especially when we were playing
’’Kill The Man With The Ball.”

All of us were a little strange
when we were kids. We didn't

war, religion, politics, sex, men,
children, parents, etc. Each time
the news was on, one of the pa-
tients had a comment about
something. Usually, I fed one
spunky Italian lady during Chan-
nel 11’s First Edition. She was
rather prejudiced, and every time
the news had coverage of the
Rev. Jesse Jackson, she'd have a
comment. There was no doubt in
my mind that she did not want to
see him in the president's chair.

' When it came to the topic of

men, she told me thatshe had
often told her granddaughters that
”if any boy every touched them
’down there,’ ” to let her know
and she'd break their fingers! She
told me she'd do the same for me
if I ever needed her. Thanks, Rita.

Almost all of the patients had
some touch of Alzheimer's dis-
ease, some worse than others.
One lady, who had her 59th
wedding anniversary this year,
was constantly giving us (the
nurses and me) fantastic stories.
She sat in a wheelchair with a ta-
ble in front of it (a gerichair) most
of the day but could easily move
herself up and down the hall in
this chair’. She once, after finding

a storage room full of extra,

wheelchairs, told me that all of
those chairs were part of ”the fur-

ically produced beat — have tried
to discourage the violence, it
nonetheless persists."

Several cities have made super-

ficial attempts to curb the vio-
lence associated‘ with these
events, but the local ordinances
have few teeth.

According to the Parents Music
Resource Center in Washington,
a group founded by Tipper Gore
that monitors rock music, most at-
tempts to deal with the increas-
ing incidents of violence at these
events have been limited to de-
termining in advance the content
of the music to be played and
banning certain songs or prohibit-
ing attendance by younger chil-
dren. But the penalties for

violation of these laws are so light
that there is little incentive for the
groups to obey them. Since -the
attitudes portrayed by these
”acts" are often about rebellion
against authority, one should not
expect compliance in the face of
$500 fines and, in a few cases,
jail terms which, as far as can be
determined, have never been
imposed.

In San Antonio, Texas, which
has been called the ”heavy me-
tal capital of the United States”
because it has attracted so many
of the groups, local officials have
outlined in a city ordinance be-
havior and lyrics which are ”be-
yond bounds.” They include
bestiality, nudity and obscenity.

”When a band comes to
town,” said Jennifer Norwood of
PMRC, ”it is supposed to meet
with the county board and reveal
the content of its program.” The

niture coming from her house.”
She then asked me to help her
move it. In order to find out
where this story was headed (we
never knew where they came
from) I asked her where she was
going to move this furniture. She
very matter-of-factly said, ”Put it
in that tree over there.” Whoa,
Olga, you don't put furniture in
a tree. ”Oh, OK,” she replied. An
easily won battle for me and one
soon forgotten by her.

From being around these peo-
ple everyday, you sometimes
tend to think that you're going a
little crazy yourself. Other times,
you know you're going crazy.
The bottom line, however, is that
you come to learn to be much
more patient and understanding
about a lot of things. You also
learn a lot about yourself. I don't
think there was ever a day when
I could go into work in a bad
mood. It was more important to
bring as much sunshine into this
hospital of over 600 patients as
could possibly fit. The building
didn't have air conditioning, so
you had to tolerate days when it
was 98 degrees inside, but you
could never let anyone ”see you
sweat” — it was kind of an un-
written rule. -

The love that came from so

Did he plan to shoot it? What if
he did? .

Regardless of the boy's think-
ing, his age makes him innocent.
He won't go to jail, but he will
be given more attention than any
kid could ever hope for. Perhaps,
that’s why he did it.

Sometimes society tends to for-
get that children are human be-
ings. As adults, we take the
responsibility of sheltering our
kids, not only from the world but
from themselves. Yet, children
have the same needs and wants
as adults do; they are only ex-
pressed in a different way.

The Florida boy is the perfect
case study for every aspiring de-
velopmental psychologist. One
could spend years theorizing his
motivations and actions. Yet, if
the child were an adult, we
would only care that he be im-
prisoned.

Crime can't be as easily under-

San Antonio ordinance says that.
if objectionable material is con-
tained in the program, tickets. for
the concert must be printed with
a warning that children 13 and
under will not be admitted.
Norwood said the ordinance.
has never been tested because
many bands have chosen to go to
other cities where regulations are
less restrictive or do not exist.
Perhaps the most detailed or-
dinance in the country is that of
St. Louis, Mo. Seven pages long,
it prohibits acts on stage that
simulate or suggest in action or
language ”ana| copulation, sex
with a corpse, sex with a child,
rape, incest and sexually objec-
tionable |anguage.” That some of
these concerts contain such
material ought to shock and ou-
trage parents and politicians
alike, but most people are blind
to what’ takes place once they

many ladies for the smallest
things had to be their best part of
the job. Just for remembering that
someone liked prune juice or
buttermilk every night before go-.
ing to bed or that they liked to
have their head up or their feet
down sometimes made all the
difference to them. They never
failed to deliver a smile or a thank
you after you had helped them
out, never. The sincerity that
came from their thanks never
failed to amaze me. It wasn't just
a response that was part of cul-
tural expectations, it was a
response with a lot of feeling be—
hind it.

It's funny, but when we had to
send our patients to the hospital
from time to time, there was a
noticeable absence on the floor.

Usually, I can't wait to quit my
summer job and get back to
school. This time, I have an ex-
ception. I grew to love my ’’little
old ladies” more than I might
ever have imagined. I also
learned to respect them along
with many other elderly people
much more than I ever had be-
fore. They sure as hell deserve it.

stood as good vs. evil. The only
way we can successfully exist
with one another is through fear
of the law. A child who fails to
understand that is vulnerable.
As human beings, we are capa-
blesof anything, depending on the
circumstances. If we are faced
with death, we'll kill to survive.

‘ Though many of us don't have to

make that decision, other en-
vironmental factors affect us in a
similar way. A ”normal adult”
will act inlhis best interests, wi-
thin the boundaries of the law. A
child can only act in his best in-
terests.

We can't treat a child's crime
with psychology and an adult’s
crime with imprisonment. Maybe
the solution can be found by ex-
amining the environment we cre-
ate for ourselves.

While First Amendment con-
siderations are always a factor in
l_imiting artistic expression (if one
can call these acts ”artistic”), the
courts have repeatedly made it
clear that the First Amendment
does not protect obscenity.

The first line of defense in halt-

ing the senseless violence is for .

parents to ”just say no” to their
young children who ask to attend
these filthy concerts. Beyond that,
local officials ought to ”just say
no” to the bands. If children were
subject to food poisoning in the
school cafeteria, officials would
move quickly to rectify the
problem. They should do the
same with the the more extreme
rap and rock concerts which are
not only poisoning the minds and
spirits of young children, but are
increasingly putting their bodies
at risk as well.
