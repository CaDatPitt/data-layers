the expenses for redecorating the

‘Pitt president’s office. '

Pitt released a detailed list of

the expenses for the $82,000

‘redecoration of President J.

Dennis O’Connor’s office
Thursday, after originally refusing
to release the specifics.

The costs include $9,850 for a
blue “commercial—grade’-’ carpet,
$6,051 to re—upholster 20 pieces
of furniture, $6,156 for two area
rugs and $13,402 in drapes for 12

Some of the new furniture is
being bought specifically to
accommodate the preferences of
the new president, according to
Pitt spokesperson Tim Ziaukas.

The fate of the Syria Mosque still hangs by a
thread as the Committee to Save the Syria Mosque
continues its efforts to stop the demolition of the
72-year-old building, which began last week.

The case will be reviewedon Sept. 4 by City
Council, which will decide whether or not to ratify
the Historical Review Comrnission’s designation of
the mosque as a historical site. ' ’ V

‘Council's second andﬁnal vote will be on Sept.

Such ratification would require National

by Presbyterian University Hospital, to cease

A as simple as that.

“Assuming City Council designates the site, which
is not a sure thing, the mayor would veto it anyway.
And then it would [take] six votes to override the

Spread of TB at Presby ‘puzzling’

By Aric W. Buckholt

V Staff‘ Wﬁter

Three of seven patients who
contracted tuberculosis at
Presbyterian University Hospital
after undergoing treatment for
kidney transplants arealive today.

Seven patients in the kidney-
transplant ward tested positive
for TB between October 1990
and January 1991. Three patients
died of causes related to TB and
a fourth died, of causes related to

/dialysis treatment. All seven
patients were taking the
experimental anti—rejection drug
FK506:

According to Dr. Ron Shapiro,

transplant surgeon for four of the V

up v;nv— ..-. .

seven patients, “The epidemic

has been taken care of. It has

been over for six months.”
Shapiro said he “does not think”

that the drug FKS06 could have ‘t

facilitated the spread of the TB.
The drug suppresses the body’s

ability to fight off infection.

The TB came into Presbyafter
a transplant patient was exposed
when he visited his mother in

anothenhospital, according to"

Shapiro. The patient’s mother,
whose roommate was later
diagnosed as having TB, was in
an intensive—care unit at the time.

The TB was apparently spread
after the patient came to Presby
for care related to his transplant.

infection control for the University
of Pittsburgh Medical Center said,
“The spread of the TB is puzzling
because the roommate of the
original case did not get TB, and

he would have been the most 

likely to contract it.”

“We are not yet sure of how it '

spread down the hall in the ward.
We looked into the ventilation
system, and there is nothing
wrong that might have facilitated
the spread,” Medvick said.

“We also checked to see i_f the
room was different or if there was

excessive air flow into the hall, _

and nothing was found. The

problem is that TB can spread’_

United Faculty attempts
to raise faculty salaries

By Megan Bertino
Staff Writer

The United Faculty is seeking
to reform Pitt’s salary policy,
according to UF President Philip
Wion.

UP is trying to make the salaries
for faculty “more fair and equitable
so [all faculty] make at least the
cost of living,” Wion said.

Pitt’s faculty salaries have
consistently ranked below the
mean for- the 57 schools in the
Association of American
Universities,

UF specifically wants to seek
compensation for faculty who
have been at Pitt for a number of
years at a constant salary. Wion
said UF wants to devise a new
system to make faculty salaries
more equitable with those of
junior professors who move
rapidly up the pay scale.

Achieving a more even
distribution of salaries across
different departments is also a
goal of UF. Wion acknowledged
that some departments are more
marketable than others, but “there
are people who have been here
for 10 or 20 years, making less
than Pittsburgh public—school

teachers.” 

UF is also hoping to establish
fixed-year terms ’ for
administrators, according to
Wion. Under this system,
administrators would sign on for
a specified number of years.

At the end of the term, faculty
and students would determine if
the administrators should be
signed for another term or be
replaced. Wion said fixed terms
“will be a way of" holding
administrators accountable; that’s
very important.”

Wion said that this plan is not
“unconnected” to former

President Wesley Posvar’s long '

term as president and recent
events but that the idea has been
proposed in the past. Wion said,
“We need to regularize terms
under which administrators
serve.”

UF would also like more
openness about the budget from
Pitt President]. Dennis O’Connor
and the university Board of

Trustees. Wion said UF would 1

like to end the secretiveness about
Posvar’s pension and raises.
O’Connor and UF have already
begun to work toward change by

CWO defends (women’s choice.    

By Rebecca Wilkins
Sla_[fW'r1'ter

A woman’s right to have
choices is the most important
thing about feminism, according
to Mary Wivell, Campus
Women’s Organization co-
president.

“We want them to have
choices about work; we want
them to have choices about
marriage, and we want them to
have choices' about having
children,” she said.

Wivell, Chris Helsel and
Meghan Malloy are, CWO CO-
prcsidents this year’.

Rape—awareness activities will
be important for the CWO this
_ year. “It’s a big issue-at college,”

Wivell said.

“There are four of us sitting
here, and statistically one in
four college women has been
or will be raped,” she said.

Education will continue to be
a major focus for the group.

“A lot of women and a lot of
people on campus in general
don’tunderstandwhatfeminism
is, and I think we want to raise
awareness of that word itself,”
said _ CWO member Gina
McFarlin. A

“There are a lot of different
negative connotations, and we
don’t want people to think we’re
just a bunch of man—haters,”
McFarlin said.

“We’re about a lot of positive

things, a lot of positive issues,-

and we’re just trying to get
people to understand_that it’s a
positive group and we have
positive focuses,” she added.

~ Planned activities for the year
include movies, pro—choice
activities, involvement in the
“Protect Yourself’ seminar, a
fund raiser for a woman’s shelter
and newsletters.

“We’re not positive of
everything we’ll" do" this
semester, because we want to
get together and see what the
members want to do,” Wivell
said.

If we had a more equal society, men would i

not have to live up to a macho domineering
definition of a man. A man could just be
himselﬁ and  brutality would not be

valued

-Chris ‘Helsel

McFarlin also cited the
women’s studies program as a
source of education for women
and men who are interested in
feminism.

According to Helsel, the CWO
newsletter will regularly include
suggestions for recommended
reading. ,

The women’ cited Alice
Walker, Margaret Atwood, Kate
Millet, Toni Morrison and Gerda
Lerner as seminal feminist
authors.

The group said that men
would also benefit from a non-
patriarchal society.‘ .

“If we had a more equal
society, men would not have to
live up to a macho domineering
definition of a man,” said Helsel.
“A man could just be himself,
and machoism and brutality
would not be valued.“

“Just like we’re trying to see
through what has been taught
to us, how we should be, men
should see through that
conditioning, too,” she said.

They‘ agreed that the
controversy in Wichita, where
pro-life‘ activists from all over

the country have been blocking V

abortion clinics throughout the

‘summer, represents hypocrisy

in the pro-life movement.

“T.o so blatantly and
continually ‘confront women,
to lay in front of clinics day after
day and not let women enter
and call them murderers is
horrible,” Helsel said.

“It’s not very Christian,”
McFarlin added. _ , ,

Helsel said “pro-life” people
are really anti-choice.

“We are pro-life; we are pro-

women’s lives,” she said.

“Life doesn’t only include
fetuses,” said McFarl_in. “Our
lives matter too.” I

Wivell said pro—lifers do not

consider the quality of life after .

the child is born.

McFarlin suggested that the I

pro-life movement work to help
the children who are already
alive but who do not have food,
homes or education.

Feminism has created many-

changes and benefits for
women, but the women agreed
that the movement still has work
to do. 1
“Women thought that when
they had equal access to jobs
then society would equal out
— husbands would take more

responsibility in the home, and if

day care would become more
available,” Helsel said.
' ‘_‘What’s happened is we got

the access to the jobs, but

nothing else has changed,” she
said. V ,
“We still do all the workat

home; we still don’t have

adequate day care unless we
have money,” Helsel said.

McFarlin said feminism has  _,
onlybeenintegratedintocertain'.'  ‘

parts of the system‘, and that a
varied definition of a woman is
essential to the feminist

movement. _ _
“We as the collective. are
women with different

experiences, just as men are,”,‘ C

she said. ,

The Campus Women’s
Organization's
will be held at 8:15 p.m. on

Sept. 9 in the Cathedral of A  

Learning.

recognized,” she said.

Shapiro said this strain of
TB was “unusually virulent.
I’ve never seen anything like
it. Normally, TB is not this
contagious, which makes
this unusual.”

Nineteen of 29 nurses who
worked in the ICU at the
hospital where the virus
originated have also tested
positive for TB, according
to Shapiro. “That. 19 of 29
nurses tested positive with
the same strain is very
uncommon.”

The hospital has taken
steps to make sure the TB is
gone. “We tested everybody p
in the unit where the TB
was found. To date over
1,200 employees alone have
been tested, and we are
also testing patients’ family
members,” Medvick said.

Medvick said Presby will
also try to ensure that no
outbreak will occur again in
the future.

“To prevent future
outbreaks, if a patient who
is not in isolation is
discovered to have TB, all
patients who are in the same
unit as the patient or were
in the unit while the patient
was there will be tested
whether they are in the same
room or down the hall.”

the meeting itself is a victory
because Posvar consistently
refused to meet with the group.

Wion said UF would have more
strength in its dealings with
O’Connor if the faculty had voted
to unionize last spring. Wion
said recent events may have been
enough to sway the 250 votes
needed to unionize, but
Pennsylvania law mandates that
another election to unionize
cannot be held for atleast one

previous one. \
Wion said UF is hopeful about
the future, but “unless there are

said.

Not to maintain the president’s
office ‘‘would be shortsighted and
foolish, and that is not what this
administration or this president is
all about,” Ziaukas said.

The office has probably not
been redecorated since Posvar
came into office in 1967, Associate

Vice President for Facilities

Management Tom Hussey said.

“When you do a restoration
like this, you’re not doing it for
the current president but for the
future. presidents, for the
presidents of the next century,”
Ziaukas said.

The redecoration began on

Aug. 1, and the university hopes
to have it finished by the end of
September.

The funds for the redecoration
are coming from the facilities-
management budget.

The manual work in the office
is being done by university
workers. Anything that Pitt did
not already have in stock was bid
out to local retailers, Guzman
said. _

Included in the budget for the
redecoration is $4,441 for
miscellaneous and contingency
costs.

‘The project is currently on
schedule and has not gone over
budget, Hussey said.

 

“If we do not use contingency,
we will finish the job $4,000
under budget,” Hussey said.

While the redecoration of the
president’s office is justified, the
price seems “excessive,” Student
Government‘ Board President
Brent Saunders said. But
Saunders added that he hoped
the controversy would not hurt
O’Connor.

“I feel bad for O’Connor
because I think he is going to be
such a good president. He has
already established good ties with
student leaders, and I hope that
this incident will not be an
indication of what is to come,”
Saunders said.

Tuition money for a desk

"As far as the redecoration of Pitt’s presidential office

1 goes, things have gone from bad to worse. '

While spending $82,000 to redo the office seeme
excessive, the recently released cost breakdown makes
the expenditure even more outrageous. Most students
can’t imagine what drapes could possibly be worth
-$13,402. Nor is it easy to fathom why our new president
needs $5,500 custom bookcases.

Though spending $4,000 for a sofa may be an everyday
occurrence in the corporate world, university administrators
must realize that Pitt is a learning institution, and O’Connor
is a university president, not a CEO. In a large corporation,
‘$3,200 is probably a drop in the bucket. At a university,
a $3,200 desk could pay a student’s tuition for a term.

To his credit, last week O’Connor did take a positive
step. He remembered a promise he made to make Pitt a
~more open university and kept that promise by releasing
the specific costs of the redecoration.

However the figures that were released contradict

“leaner administration.”

The greedy Pitt Panther has once again sprayed its
territory in Oakland like a common housecat. ,

Not content with its acquisition of the Syria Mosque, Pitt
demolished the front of the entertainment center last

9‘ week to deter efforts by citizens and city officials to have

the mosque designated a historical landmark, safe from.
the Pitt wrecking ball. ‘

The audacity of the university’s action is. phenomenal.
By merely defacing the mosque, Pitt has shown once
again its complete lack of respect for the citizens of
Pittsburgh.

City Council will take a second vote on landmark status
for the mosque September 10. A likely veto by Mayor
Sophie Masloff could be overridden by a six-vote majority
of council. Rather than wait for the elected officials of the
city to make a final decision, Pitt inﬂicted external damage
to the structure to demoralize the opposition.

Pitt’s new tactic of “If we can’t have .it, no one can”‘
smacks of the shortsighted and sophomoric processes by
which decisions are made at the university.

Many times the City Council has been powerless to
intervene in Pitt_’s tainted affairs. This time it has nothing
standing in its way.

Elections sign of liberalism’s decline

And so the liberals are pouting
over their nonexistent chances
for the. presidency in 1992.
Gratifying, to be sure. But their
troubles are hardly limited to this
coming election year. A slow
deterioration has afﬂicted the
once—noble liberal cause for some
time, taking it further and further

from the concerns of normal

Americans and into the realm of
the insane and the absurd.
Witness, as proof, the
turnaround in national politics
since Lyndon Johnson trounced
conservative Barry Goldwater in
the 1964 presidential race. Since
then _the Democrats won one
race, the post—Watergate anomaly
that was Jimmy Carter. And the

presidency was captured by a‘

man in 1980 who mirrored
Goldwater’s views exactly. Only
16 years separated the landslide
loss of conservatism in 1964 from
Reagan’s mandate from the
electorate.

What happened in the
‘meantime was _a ﬂock of liberal
“reforms” that nearly left the

Rob .
Lewis

whole nation a battered heap of
rubble. Welfare systems that
promised to lift poor Americans
to prosperity but instead kept
them poor as the goal of getting
them off of -welfare was
abandoned. Taxation squelched
incentive and innovation and
siphoned more and more billions
into the bureaucratic hole. Our’
foreign policy became a joke as

Carter, mindful of Johnson’s
Vietnam disaster, moralized like

a Sunday—school deacon as

Americans were reviled abroad,

in danger of terrorism,

assassination or kidnappings. And
cause after offbeat cause was

embraced by the Democratic
Party until people began to
perceive that their problems as

middle-class citizens came second

to those of California abalones or
wealthy feminist novelists.

The noble intentions of men
like Roosevelt and Kennedy are

no more than history now, -

trucked out for show at election
time but believed in no more by
those today who have stolen that
lovely word “liberal” and applied

_ it to an array of causes and beliefs

that have no resemblance to the
patriotism and political morality
of these men. This is the liberal
movement of today, marked by
the bland (Dukakis), the
incompetent CDukakis again) and

the irresponsible (Rev. J. Jackson). ‘

JFK and FDR surely must be
spinning in their graves.

So the next time some liberal
brushes the hair out of his eyes

and complains to you how"

conservatives have made
“liberalism” a dirty word, remind
them that it was mostly their

 

actions that have made the term 

so reviled in politics today.

Indeed, they didn't need our help

at all.

Pitt linebacker Ricardo McDonald (48), who had two sacks, forces West Virginia quarterback Darren

Studstil1(14) to get rid of the ball.

By Derek Willis - *

_'Asst. Sports Editor

There were a lot of unknowns for the Pitt
football team before Saturday night. Now there
are encouraging signs Where there had been
question marks. ‘‘ ' »

Coming into the openeragainst West Virginia,

I the main questions, centered around the youth
7 and inexperience at several positions: running

back, inside linebacker and wide receiver. All
three spots were strengths for the Panthers in
their 34-3 win.

“We’ve got some good young players, and

we’re pleased with the way they performed,” said

Pitt head coach Paul Hackett.

Jermaine Williams, making his ﬁrst collegiate
start, led Pitt with 74 yards on 16 carries.

“I‘was a bit nervous but not scared,” said
Williams. “I had some -butterﬂies, but I think
everybody did at first.

The redshirt sophomore from Detroit started
jslowly, garnering only 19 yards by the half, but
running behind an offensiveline which did not
allow a tackle for loss, he finished strong.

“lWi1liamsl just needed a little conﬁdence,” said

New players impact z'nfi1"st game  

lineman Jeff Christy, “and once he got it he kept

getting better.” ‘ 1
Williams _and senior Glenn Deveaux (14 carries

for 51 yards) anchored a ground attack that

enabled Pitt to control the ball nearly five minutes '
more than the Mountaineers. Not a bad first

game, right? ‘ V
“Yeah, but I really wanted to break a long run,

and I kept on getting these four- and ﬁve-yard

ones,” said Williams. _
Helping to contain West‘ Virginia’s rushing

attackwas ﬁrst-year inside linebacker Tom '

Tumulty, who was given the nod to start in his
first game. The Pitt defense limited WVU to 115

yards on the ground, compared to last year’s 378-‘

yard outburst.
“We just came_ together and helped each other
out,” said Tumulty. “The coaches always
emphasize running to the ball, and we did really
well doing that.”
If you noticed, Pitt‘is' continuing last -year’s

practice of running to the spot of the tackle and . I

surrounding the downed opponent.

THE PITI‘ NEWS, Tuesday, September 3, 1991

 Ryan Buncher
Staﬂ“ Writer

The Pitt volleyball team opened
its season with two wins and a
disappointing loss at the USAir

‘ Volleyball Classic this past

weekend at Fitzgerald Field
House.

Sweeping three games from
Arizona and Miami (Ohio) and
losing to 16th—ranked Penn State
may not seem so bad, but the
Panthers, ranked 17th entering

”’ . the weekend, are looking to move

5 up, and beating Penn State would
have been a good start. Pitt not
only lost both matches to Penn
State last year, but no player" on
the current Panther roster has
ever been a part of a win over the
Lions.

“It was very frustrating because
we were that close,” said
sophomore outside hitter Ann
Marie Lucanie, who was named
to the all-tournament team. “We
had them in the fourth game, and
we let up a bit.”

Pitt had a two-games-to-one

lead entering the fourth game

and took a 12-8 lead, but they
just could'not finish it out. They
had two match points and lost

them on hitting errors into the
net by seniors Heather Hollands
and Sue Zonneville, before Penn
State won the game.

The fifth game was a rally
game in which both teams could
score on each point, not just the.
team that was serving. There was
some confusion over whether
there was a 17-point cap on the
rally game, but the game didn’t
reach that point anyway. Penn
State Coach Russ Rose said he
thought that gave his team an
advantage.

“The rally score is very
controversial because it is sucha ‘
different strategy,”Rose said.

Pitt Coach Sue Woodstra said,
“I think it was an advantage for
us due to our style of play. We
just didn’t make the key plays
when we ‘needed them.”

The game was even up to 14- V
14, Pitt being hurt by consecutive '
service errors by Dee MacAuley

and Lucanie. Penn State took the
lead on a Kim Kumfer kill, and
Jenny Myszewski’s hit down the
middle won the match.

Penn State is not as strong as
last year, when they were 44-1,
and they are a younger team, but
the Panthers could not take

so:

advantage due to a very weak
start. They lost the first game 12-
15, mostly due to 14 errors
compared to-only seven for the
Lions. When Penn State visited
Fitzgerald Field House last year,
Pitt came apart after a tough loss
in the first game and was swept.
This time they not only held it
together, they took control of the
match, winning the next two
games by 15-7 scores and
controlled the fourth game until
some late mistakes cost them.
“We just had a lot of unforced
errors,” Lucanie said. “The
motivation was deﬁnitely there;
we all really wanted this. We had
them [in the fourth game], and
we let up a bit. A good team
won’t let you get away with that.”
Lucanie was tops on the team
in kills with 22 and digs with 32
-butsaigd of her own play, “I really
didn’t play well. Look at the
stats.” The stat she was probably
referring to was errors, and she
had 12. Zonneville and MacAuley
had 15 and 20 digs respectively
to go along with 13 kills and six
errors. Linda Zols struggledwith
10 errors to go along with nine
kills, a -.025 kill percentage.
Lucanie and Woodstra both
pointed out that f1rst—year setter
Annemarie, Mernagh may have
been bothered by nervousness
about playing her first match".
The whole team was bothered
by the play of Penn State junior
Leanne Kling, who had 27 kills.

 

An encouraging sign was the
team’s response to the loss. They
followed the first loss to Penn
State last year with a rather
uninspired performance in losing
to a Duke team they hadalready
beaten twice. This time they had
two very solid efforts in -two
matches Saturday. A

“We stayed consistent,” said
Woodstra, “[Lucanie and
Mernagh] both played very well
and had a lot of support from
everybody else. Annie (Mernagh)
has a lot of poise, and that is what
pulled her through. She doesn’t
look like a freshman to me.”

Mernagh played well enough,
in fact, to join Lucanie on the all-
tournament ‘team.

Pitt beat Miami (Ohio) in the
early game 15-10, 15-5, 15-8. The
Panthers made only 10 errors for
a .359 kill percentage after making
41 for a .146 percentage against
Penn State. Lucanie had 14 kills
and 15 digs to go along with one
error, and Zonneville had 11 kills
and three errors. Woodstra also
used her bench a little more, with
Bridg/et Gary, Chelsea
Hemi-ngway and Carrie Thornton

-getting signiﬁcant playing time.

Shelly Seanor saw almost all of
the playing time off the bench
against Penn State, the exception
being a one-point appearance

.for Gary’. The first appearances

by Gary and Thornton, who are
both making comebacks from

knee surgery, drew cheers from

THE PI'lT NEWS, Tuesday, September 3, 1991

 

By Michael Milliron
Staff Writer

Marty Schottenheimer will
finally make it to the big dance
this year with the Kansas City
Chiefs. Three times his Cleveland
Brown teams, of decent talent,
fell to the Denver Broncos in
American Football Conference
Championship games. The only
thing that would stand in the

Chiefs’ way would be an injury to .

quarterback Steve DeBerg, who
is no spring chicken. DeBerg
remarkably threw only four
interceptions last year.

Position by position, Kansas
City possesses the best defense
in the National Football League.
Outside linebacker Derrick
Thomas is a sacking machine
(ask Dave Krieg) and the player
Cornelius Bennett was supposed
to be. Inside linebacker Percy
Snow’s injury was a concern, but
astute General Manager Carl
Peterson plucked heavy-hitting
ILB Ervin Randle away from the
Bucs. Inside linebacker Dino
Hackett and OLB Chris Martin
are underrated.

\ The secondary is outstanding
with Pro—Bowl cornerbacks Albert
Lewis and Kevin Ross. What free
safety Deron Cherry lacks in
speed, he makes up for in savvy

and experience. Kansas City can
go with youth — Kevin Porter —
or experience — Lloyd Burruss
—— at strong safety with no dropoff
in performance. Schottenheimer’s
front three is one of the fewin the
league that can pressure the
passer without blitzing a
linebacker. Defensive ends Neil
Smith and Bill Maas, and nose
tackle Dan Saleaumua are a
formidable trio.

Offensively, the Chiefs like to
keep it on the ground, and why
not, when your stable of backs
includes Christian Okoye, Barry
Word, Bill Jones and number-
one pick Harvey Williams? The
offensive line is criticized for
lacking athleticism, but how
athletic do you need to be when
you average six feet, five inches
and 290 pounds across the board?
Stephone Paige and Robb Thomas
arethe wideouts; however, look
for third—rounder Tim Barnett to
emerge and take AFC Rookie of
the Year honors. (11-5 and a trip
to the Super Bowl.)

Al Davis saw his beloved Los
Angeles Raiders return to glory
by winning the division and a
playoff game before suffering total
humiliation in Buffalo last year.
Without Bo Jackson, QB Jay
Schroeder was unable to answer
Jim Kelly's salvos. They cannot

win the Super Bowl with the
erratic Schroeder. Davis should
make a pitch for Phil Simms, as
he would fit this team like a
glove.

Players like safety Ronnie Lott
and running back Roger Craig do
win Super Bowls, which is why
the Raiders acquired them via
Plan B. Lott will be an enforcer at
strong safety. Craig will be
effective with the number of
opportunities he gets in a crowded
Raider backfield that includes
Marcus Allen, Steve Smith, rookie
Nick Bell and maybe that injured
guy named Bo.

The offensive line is strong at
center and guard but could be
upgraded at tackle. Speed kills,
and that is what the Raidershave
at receiver with Willie Gault,
Mervyn Fernandez, Tim Brown
and Jamie Holland.

Defensive lineman Howie Long
still leads the defense. Joining
Long on the line tO- create a
monster pass rush are defensive

. tackles Bob Golic and Scott Davis,

and defensive end Greg
Townsend. The secondary has
tough, fast, athletic corners, Lott
and Eddie Anderson at free safety.

defensive line and fellow

3‘ _ linebacker Charles Williams.

“The front three freed me up to

‘ make a lot of the tackles," he

_said, “and Charles and I
‘ complement each other very well;
we kind of play as one player out

, there.”

Perhaps the most problematic
position in the preseason for the
Pitt coaching staff was wide
receiver. Quarterback Alex Van
Pelt completed just two passes to
wideouts, but one was a 45-yard
touchdown to redshirt first-year
player Chad Askew.

“I feel great for Chad,” said Van
Pelt. “He can make the big play,
and I expect a lot more from
him.”

Although the tight ends and
running backs were the main
targets for Van Pelt, it wasn’t
because of the relative
inexperience of the receivers.
“They [WVUl played a soft zone,
leaving the short routes open,”
said Van Pelt. “They also didn’t
blitz too much, so the coverage
dictated our passing game.”

Prior to this game, the meshing
of new and veteran players was a
big concern for Hackett. Now, at
least for a while, it seems that this
team fits together rather nicely.
“Our chemistry is good,” said
Tu multy. “There's a close
comraderie on this team, and that
makes us play with heart because
we want to help each other out.”

AFC

Continued from page 15 X"

will try to dominate you with a
powerful, athletic front seven.
Their objective is to control the
clock a la the New York Giants.
Good luck, guys.

Dan Henning has never won
anywhere as a head coach and
is on the hot seat with owner
Alex Spanos. Henning also
disagrees with GM Bobby
Beathard over who the starting
QB should be. He gave in to
both Beathard and Spanos, so
second-year man John Friesz
starts. .

Having to choose between
Friesz and Billy Joe Tolliver
(since traded to the Falcons)
tells you what a mess things are
in San Diego.

In Anthony Miller, the
Chargers have the most talented
receiver in the AFC going to
waste, as no one can get him
the ball consistently. He is
capable of Jerry Rice-type
numbers. ' ’

San Diego should come up
with some big defensive plays,
since they are stocked with
guys like LB/DE Leslie O’Neal,
DE Burt Grossman, LB Junior
Seau, cornerback Gill Byrd and
safety Stanley Richard. (5-1 1, as
Henning gets the axe again.)

Coach Chuck Knox led the
Seattle Seahawks to a 9-7
record last year as they
threatened to make the playoffs.
During the off—season he was
said to have parted the Red Sea.
The miracles will cease as this
season begins. The Seahawks
are quite possibly the least
talented team in the league.
This team is going to start paying
for front—office decisions like
Brian Bosworth and Kelly
Stouffer.

Dave Krieg held onto the
starting job, but what has he
ever won? Now he’ll be nursing
a broken thumb for eight weeks
while the Seahawk offense
proves it can make any QB

‘rushing and receiving, and it is

look bad. RB Derrick Fenner is
not Curt Warner and has the
look of a one—year phenom.
John L. Williams is overused

just a matter of time until there
is no more tread left on his tires.

The offensive line is decent,
but Fenner finds holes about as
well as Pitt avoids bad publicity.
Seattle’s receiving corps needs
help; however, rookies Doug
Thomas and David Daniels are
not the answer.

Defensive linemenJeff Bryant
and Jacob Green are going to
be collecting Social Security
before the front office finds
replacements for them. Cortez
Kennedy is a coiner at DT.

Tony Woods will try to make
the transition to DB. There is
some quality linebacking on the A
Seahawks, but they are on the
trainer’s table too much. Robert
Blackmon has a bright future at
safety. (3-13, as Knox pays for
front—office blunders.)

the pass a whole lot easier.”
The second half got more
interesting for the fans as the
Panthers even got a touchdown
on an interception return by none
other than 325—pound defensive
lineman Sean Gilbert, who
celebrated with his own version
of the “Gilbert Shufﬂe:” Also,

— redshirt Chad Askew, in his first

year, scored his first collegiate

’ touchdown on a 45-yard strike

from quarterback Alex Van Pelt.
After the Gilbert rumble, many
of the 68,041 Mountaineer fans

began -heading for the door.

The win came after _ a well-
documented off—season and
served as a release for the players
and coaches. After the game they
gathered with the group of loyal
Panther supporters that had
travelled to Morgaritown.

None of the Pitt staff appeared
more relieved than coach Hackett.
After suffering through last year,
Hackett dubbed this a game of
huge proportions. It turned out
to be a huge Panther victory.

“I think we were well prepared ,.

for this game and pretty

determined,” Hackett said. “We
remained pretty calm, and I think

that losing their quarterback hurt .

them tremendously. I think that

we were tough mentally and

physicallyf’ 5
While the win lifted part of a

. load off the Panthers’ shoulders,

they still have to play Southern
Mississippi at Pitt Stadium, where
they have not won since October
13 of last year, against Rutgers.

“It’s been a rocky road,” said
Hackett. “However this is just
one win. We have to stay focused
for the next 10 games.’

of five yards on second down
and another penalty, O’Donnell
and Stone connected, thus sealing
the Steeler victory.

Defense was the star of the
game, thwarting the Chargers
advances to the end zone until

“I thought we did a good job
for three -quarters,” said
cornerback Rod \X/oodson. “We

“I think we gave up some things
