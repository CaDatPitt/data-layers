elections chairperson Mauina Simon, far right, looks on.

’The University. of Pittsburgh
may be nearing a~'settlement in a
dispute with Champion Products,

" Inc. of Rochester, N .Y'. over the use

of University symbols_in'its sports
wear products.

According to assistant university
counsel Ronald Talarico, who has

~ been handling the case for the uni-

-

 

versity, the disputing parties are to
meet on Monday for a status con-
ference in the judge’s chambers.
“You discuss a lot of things at a
status conference like evidence
problems or how much time is

. reg/needed to set up a hearing. I’m sure

\

the issue of a settlement will‘ come
up.” . - .—_ . '
The company has refused to
comply with a trademark licensing
policy instituted by the university
in 1980 requiring all companies
who wish to use the Pitt name or

symbol to pay a $100 annual fee

plus a six percent royalty on sales.
Champion has argued that since
it had marketed goods with the Pitt
name and design since 1936, it
should be exempt from the
regulation.
' On January 7, 1982, U.S. District
Judge Maurice Cohill denied the
university’s request for an injunc-

other clothing bearing the Pitt
Panther name and other, sports
symbols.

The university subsequently

‘appealed the decision and the U.S.

Court of Appeals for the Third Cir-
cuit reversed the lower court ruling
in an opinion filed last August 12.
The decision returned the case to
the U.S. District Court from which
it came. 4 _ ,

Champion failed in its attempt
to have the Appeals Court decision
reversed when the Supreme Court
refused to hearthe case.

Student Government

The 1983 Student Government
Board was sworn in lastnight in a
ceremony at Soldiers and Sailors
Memorial Hall.

Mark Downs, the new president,
told the audience of student‘ lead-
ers, administrators and parents,

that he hopes the board “fulfill(s) _

all the expectations that are placed
on them by the administration and
the students.”

He added that the coming year
should bring some excitement to
the board with the completion of
the Schenley Hall renovations and
the fraternity housing complex.

“Enthusiasm and interest in the
University of Pittsburgh will be the
key to our success in the next year,”
he said.

Downs "was sworn in after outgo-~

ing president Todd _DeLuca made
his farewell addressrto the audience
and said his presidency helped him
in many ways from overcoming the
fear of public speaking to learning
how to talk to senators and
congressmen.

DeLuca said he went into his

  _ Board Is Inaugurated

position with an attitude that
cooperation between all board
members was the best way to run
the board; he -said this approach

proved to be the right one.

After Downs was sworn in, he
gave the oath of office to the new
eight board members including
Mindy Goldberg, who became a
member after Mark Steele resigned,
and Jeff Delmontagne, who served

on the l982 board.

In their opening remarks, both‘
Pitt chancellor Wesley Posvar and
Vice Chancellor for Student Affairs
Conney Kimbo, lauded the old
board and new board, with Pos-
var’s saying that in recent years
there has been a “very strong stu-
dent government.” He said he
anticipates the 1983 board to~con-

tinue that strength.‘

Kimbo said the 1982 board chal-
lenged and fulfilled all the goals it
set and hoped the new board would

do the same. A

Before getting down to_ business,
the new board Wlll take a weekend
retreat at the Harley Hotel in Mon-

roeville next weekend.

ible Settlement

“We are on a much better footing
now,” Talarico said. “We have a

' decision in our pocket.”

The Appeals Court decision
gives Pitt the upper hand in any
bargaining which may take place
to settle the dispute out of court.

According to Talarico, the
Appeals Court decision has settled
the case in Pitt's favor. What
remains to be worked out in the
District Court is the specifics of a
decision.

In an article which appeared in
the University Times on Sep-
tember 9, 1982, Talarico was

quoted as saying, “the most iernme-__ _  _.
diate effect of this decision has been
_ to remove a cloud that hadled some .
manufacturers to believe that they . ’
could produce Pitt goods without .

our permission.”

According to Champion’s tes-
timony in the Appeals case, Pitt is”
one of 10,000 schools whose names,
or designs they imprint on sports-
wear. Several of those schools have
also filed trademark infringement
against "Champion
including the University ofSouth-
em California, UCLA, and the '

proceedings

University of Florida.

Opinion  

Were They 

  Kidding?

A new Student Government Board (SGB)
was inaugurated last night, complete with
laudatory comments from Chancellor Wes-
ley Posvar and from Conney Kimbo,’ the
senior vice-chancellor for student affairs.
These learned men praised the new officers
and their predecessors as strong leaders who
recognized and faced the important issues.
Who were they trying to kid? _

A review of student government activity
in recent years reveals precious few issues,
and still fewer that havebeen faced by the
board in any meaningful way. Facilities for
commuter students, while a perennial
favorite for -SGB lip-service, are at an all-
time low. The Student Union, which in the

1 past provided recreation, food and rest for

Last year’s board promised to improve
communication between student govern-
ment and other university organs. The pop-
ularity of that same promise among this
year’s candidates suggests that communica-
tion hasn’t improved. _ , A

Former SGB president - Todd. _DeI:uca
made muchaof his plans to seek mandatory
teaching evaluations. Predicatably, some of
this year’s candidates voiced similar plans.
It’s a wonderful promise anyone can make,
but a dirty job no one wants ‘to do.

You’, too, can play this game. Just try to
name one issue handled effectively the SGB.

' No fair counting Mark Steele, who effec-
tively confronted his career plans by resign-

ing his SGB post to accept an internship"
with a local coal company.

Pitt students can hope that the new board
will not really continue in their predeces-
sors’ tradition, as Posvar predicted. That
would mean another year devoid of useful

. SGB activity. Instead, hope that the new

board can become what Posvar and Kimbo
said they were. Or were they only kidding?

Have you noticed lately how we
treat our children?

Proponents of the increasingly
popular movement in other states
to raise the legal drinking age to 21
have some very useful rhetortical
furniture on which to stand-
statistical tables that attribute an
awful lot of highway deaths to
young drunks. Of course, when we ‘ .
use these figures to justify impos-
ing a rule (like a drinking age) on
some people and not on others
with age as the critical factor, we

~ can-“mean-'only'one'thing,'antl‘We‘f

might as well be clear about that.

We mean that people under 21
are children, not mature enough to
handle the heady freedoms of full
citizenship. Not young men and
young women. Children. Boys and
girls.

Yet when we feel threatened,
when we fear that the Soviets have
got a bug in their bonnet to besiege
this or that banana republic, on

The morning rountine of crawl-
ing out of bed and over to the coffee
pot to read the newspaper, smirk
and_ reflect in true Vonnegut style
just isn’t the same since Doones-
bury left. It has only been a few
days, and I think I need a fix.

Without Gary Trudeau, who
will be left to laugh at our “Me”
generation fascination with the
“perfect tan" or Sal Putrid, boy-
wonder and Berlin punker? Gary
wasn't the only person to poke fun
at our changing lifestyles—but he
did it well. His cartoons captured a
generation of thought—from the
Watergate radio shows to a
surprise-packed trip through Rea-
gan's brain, which was banned
from some newspapers.

There was no windmill at which
Gary wouldn't tilt, and beinga car-

’ toonist rather than a journalist, he

whom do we call to stand up and
fight for our bananas? Children.
-You remember, these boys and
girls, so morally underdeveloped as
to require the state's protection
until they reach the_ age of 21 (or
until they die on foreign soil,

‘‘I find this incredible,
that we would force our
nation's young- to bear
the label children while,
at the same time,
forcing them to bear the

' ‘lTé”avV7é's't”‘Fe‘§i5b”ﬁsiibili if

our society cpnfers, the
responsibility to die.”

whichever comes first).

I find this incredible, that we
would force our nation's young to
bear the label of children while, at
the same time, forcing them to bear
the heaviest responsibility our

could make blunt observations and
get away with them. Journalists
aren’t supposed to do that. Watch-
dogs of the governmentthatthey
are, they have to laugh in private at
life's glaring absurdities and the
way our leaders lead. Journalists
don't question much anymore.
Remember when one woman at a
press conference pressed Reagan
for an answer? . Do you also
remember the response from her
fellow journalists? ‘

_ When a politician's vagueness is
just too much to ignore and a jour-

Too Young To Drink

society confers, the responsibility

' to die. ’

The question here is one of com-
ing of age: when does a person
become morally and emotionally
mature enough to handle the full
rightsand responsibilities of citi-
zenship? Clearly there is some con-
fusion here. We can only point to
the range between 18 and 21 years
and say, “It happens somewhere in

there,” and,,of course, earlier for

some than for others.

For the purposes of the law, we
have to set an arbitrary age for eve-
ryone. But to be fair, to be consis-
tent, all of the rights and responsi-

bi~l~i-t-ies— vtha-t~~ t-raditi o‘nally"'“”‘ ‘ ‘

accompany “coming of age”—to
vote, to drink, to fight—shoul/d be
tied to the same age. A

The battle cry, “Old enough to
fight, old enough to drink!” once
moved some 25 state legislatures to
lower the drinking age to 18. Now
we find that this consistency was
paid for in hundreds of highway
deaths. Perhaps the new cry should
be “Too young to drink, too young
to fight!” i

Whofll   Laugh At Us Now?

nalist persists in questioning, more
often than, not the journalist is

accused of bias or badgering. (Isn't

. it terrible the way somejournalists

hammer on those poor politicians
trying to get an answer?) '

We'll have to look to columnists
like Buchwald now to make the
connections we overlook and point
out the humor we need to see. Doo-
nesbury and the whole motley crew
including the 19605 acid crawlback
Zonker Harris, Uncle Duke and all
the rest will be back in 1984. Maybe
that will be just in time.

Everybody's raving about

- Tootsie, the film starring Dustin

Hoffman as an actor who's so
difficult that no one will work
with him. As a last resort, he

impersonates a woman, the"
guise under which he lands a-
job on a soap opera and becomes 5

the hottest actress in two hem-
ispheres. That's all right; the
film's a classic in the best of the
screwball comedy tradition.

. But come on now, are we all
so namby pamby that we fall for
it and say it's just good fun? I
sincerely hope not. Tootsie isn't
just good fun and, along with
the likes of My Man Godfrey and
such, it has a message. But_if
you care to look closely, the
message may not be as hopeful
as it first seems.

Only a man playing a woman

. couldhave made this film, and

it's essentially a film about a
man ‘showing -women how to
stand up for themselves. If you
have trouble believing that,
change the situation and make

‘ it a white male who can't get

work. He does himself in black-
face, and in the end, shows all

__ the blacks with whom he works

how to rebel against white
racists. Or change the situation
again—this time a little more
drastically.—and make the hero
a WASP male who suddenly has
an attack of conscience, moves
to Israel and, by masquerading
as a Iew, shows all the Israelis
the true meaning of Iudaism.
See what I mean? It's not some-
thing that sits well if you are a
woman. —
‘Some people, however,
prefer to see Tootsie as people
just showing others how to get
along and to have respect-for
themselves. A point like that
would be easier to believe if
Terri Garr could break o'ut of
her funny "I’m a neurotic
woman” role and if Dabney
Coleman‘weren’t so incredibly
chauvinistic. Jessica Lange, in
her role as Iulie, certainly
moves beyond her debut as
King Kong's love interest of
five or six years ago. In fact,
she's the only female in this
movie who has any guts at all,

Dustin Hoffman stars inTot51e.

Tootsie’ Dole l2eversal Not 1) S  

outside of Dorothy Michaels,
Hoffman's alter ego.

But still, withoutthe mes-
sage, Tootsie is slick and enter-

  

taining. It's really the wet’

dream of a WASP male who

wants to save the world and '

have everyone like him.

Back in the dark ages of the

I mid '70s, this reviewer was a

Tolkien fanatic, although peo-

_ ple I know now would never

guess it.~ A flashy sword or
magic wand waved through the
ancient air of days of yore holds
special sentiment for me. I have
long since parted from my fan-

tastical’ ways, but the expe- -

rience of viewing muppet-
masters Henson and Oz’_s epic,
The Dark Crystal, summoned

_ forth a sigh, yea! a tear, from my

1983 eye. I suspect that many
who, like me, were or are fans
of the high romantic,
mystically-tinged fantasy tale
will hurry to The Dark Crystal in
droves. What they feel, how-

time,

ever, may not be nostalgia,

childlike awe or anything like

groan, but that is their problem.

familiar trappings are here: an

fate of saving the world; an elf-
maiden who, of course,
becomes romantically involved,
if such innocence can feel pas-

mad tyrant; another race of
peaceful mystics who keep the

skillfully and expertly rendered '

-In addition to showing that musical tastes had moved _ 1 /

I vast understatement,

ACT OF CONTRITION
The Five
Public Records -

"Underground" rock has been
slowly crawling up the base-
ment stairs during the past few
years; now you can hear Wall of
Voodoo, Oingo Boingo and the
Psychedelic Furs on the radio.
But if you thought the genre
was extinct, here's The Five's
new E1’ to confirm that there
are, indeed, more unopened
trunks downstairs. '

Act of Contrition's three songs
deftly define the reasons behind
The Five's rather cliquish popu-
larity: vocals that spell urgency
and frenzy backed by a swirl of

. .dark, jerking music. To say that

The Five aren't conventional is a
but to
describe them as inaccessible
would be an overstatement;

,while they will never be able to

reach mass audience appeal,
there is no reason why they
couldn't become as popular as
Wall of Voodoo, etc.

"How Many Times” and
"Death Chord" take about five

- or six listenings to kick in, but in

a day or so, you'll find yourself

 

shaking your head to get ‘rid of
Reid's garbled screams, which
keep repeating themselves over
and over in your brain. This is
potent stuff.

’The band's classic version of
"Angel of the Morning". is by far
the highlight of the disc (and
they've been doing the remake a
lot longer than Juice New-
ton!)——a raucous parody that I'll
always remember for the way
the line_"...just touch my cheek
before you leave me, BAA-
ABY!"is snivelled/snarled.

Like The Five's single of 1981,
"Napalm Beach"/"You Excite
Me," Act of Contrition is made
even more colorful by the pres-
ehce of Laurence Goodby's elec-
tronic gizmos (it should be
mentioned that Laurence is no
longer a member ofithe band,
however); the effects often
sound like intergalactic aliens
conversing in their native
tongue. Brian Boru, an Irish
import, continues to improve
his flailing style (a gonzo
drummer?),>and Dave Doremus
(bass) and Tom Moran (guitars)_
round out the band's capabilities
quite nicely, thank you. Of

Photo'By Butch Belair

course, then there's Reid,
whose voice often sounds like
the magnified screeches of an
insect that's being strangled,
but he's always right on target.

Maybe there aren't as many
"underground" rock bands
around these days, especially of

the once-thriving Oakland var-
iety, but The Five shows that
the species is alive and well.

Rank & File, one would have to
wonder why.

This band's roots can be
traced back, strangely enough,
to the L.A. punk scene circa
1977-79. Rank 8: File has
emerged from that mayhem
with more civility

minimalistic basis, biting lyrics

WIN THISRECORD
David Lindley ‘
Elektra/Asylum

' David Lindley is one of those

musicians who has such a good
time at what he's doing that he
naturally transmits it to vinyl
electricity. His last album, El
Rayo—X was one of the most fun
albums of 1981 and produced
covers of "Mercury Blues,"
"Bye—Bye Love" and "Twist and
Shout" that‘ were classics in
themselves, (in addition to some
excellent original material).
_ Win This Record is much in the
same vein as Lindley's debut. It's
fast, fun and full of reggae
inflections that go so well with
Lindle,y's Tiny Tim via Buddy
' ' Jlly voice. In addition, Lindley
uses that real cheap Teisco Del
Rey guitar sound that com-
pletes the simplistic, exhilara-
tive qualities of this album._

Though El Rayo-X was largely
an album of covers, Win This‘
Record is not. Nevertheless,
Lindley pulls some irresistible?
originals out of his hat like,
"Ram—A-Lamb-Ag Man" and
"Talk To The Lawyer" that,
even with their titles, suggest
the frivolity and pure enjoy-
ment that the songs of the '50s
and '60s evoked. » ,

There's not much more to say
about this album or the artist.
Both are exceptional, and both
should. be heard. If you don't
win this album, buy it.

ZANY AFTERNOONS
Bruce McCall

My grandparents never told
me about the 1936 Cairo
World's Fair, maybe they didn't
go, but Bruce McCall's account
of the spectacle made me feel as
if I had stood at the foot of the
Pyramitrion and gazed down
the Esplanade of the Africas .in
person.

I also missed out on the ”Fab-
ulous Battle of Britain," but
McCall's rendering of the dar-
ing lone German plane attack-
ing the inside of the House of
Commons was enough to make
me relive their finest hours.

McCall, whose work has
appeared most notably in .
National Lampoon, is a talented
writer/artist who satirizes the
excesses of the 19303 through
the '50s and beyond by means of
clever advertisements (for
example, the 1946 Bulgemo-
biles), souvenir programs (the
S.S. Tyrannic, "the biggest.

Pitt's wrestling team raised its

record to 2-0 by defeating visiting "

Youngstown State 27-9, despite
some Panther mistakes.

“There was a definite lack of
intensity on our part,” said coach
Rande Stottlemeyer. “It was a sur-
prise to us, this being our first
home match. But it was good that

we wrestled the way we did and still I

were able to win the match."

The Panthers won five in a row
starting with freshman Kyle Nellis.
He easily "downed YSU’s Dom
Mancini 15-2, making his record
8-2 at the 118-lb. weight class.

At 126 lbs. it was freshman John

Hnath of Pitt squaringhis record '
at 2-2 by downing Frank Mancini -

12-6. Hnath gave up a reversal in
the closing seconds of the match to
narrowly miss a major decision.

At the 134-lb. class, Pitt’s Gary

. Bolin fell behind 5-0 after he was
‘caught on his back in the opening
minutes of the first period. He
fought back to take a 7-6 lead in

that period.

Lady   Panthersrﬁurni        

In the third period, Bolin was
again taken straight to his ‘back for

a five-point loss. But it was too late;,

he defeated Roy Thomas 17-15.

Pitt junior Craig Richey saw
action for the second time this sea-
son. He fell behind Youngstown’s
Hyun Chul Kim, 2-1, in the first
period.

In the second period, however,
Richey combined two takedowns

and a tilt to take the lead for good. V

He won 10-4.’

hit two throw-bys and a tilt to take
a quick 7-1 lead in the first period.
He eased to a 12-2 win.

At 158 pounds, Youngstown’s
Bob Donaldson scored the first

Friars For First

Conference Win

~- By TAMMY ANDERSON

_The Lady Panther. basketball
team gained its first Big East win

Wednesday night defeating Provi- '

dence University 75-68. The victory
boosts the Lady Panthers’ record to
1-2 in the Big East and gives them
an.8-5 record overall. '

-After losing two games at the ’

Dial Classic in Miami, the win over
Providence came as a must victory
for the Lady Panthers.

“This was a much-needed win
because we just came off two‘
losses,” sophomore guard Becky
Maziarz said. “Everyone was

1 psyched for this game, and the win

was uplifting for us because it is
our first Big East victory.”

Pitt head coach Judy Saurer
agreed with Maziarz. “The game-
was very important for us, not only
because we needed victory in the
Big East, but also because with this
game, we have begun what we need
to do both offensively and defen-
sively." She said. “This victory has
brought an improvement in our
play that was needed and taken us a
step toward further success in our
future play.”

Both Pitt and Providence got off
to sluggish starts. However, by
mid-first half, Pitt started picking
up both offensively and defen-
sively. Senior tri-captain Pam Mik-
lasevich began connecting on
several outside shots that paced the
Lady Panthers. However; Provi-
dence guard Kathy Finn kept the
Lady Friars in the contest by scor-
ing 18 first half points. _

The A Lady Panthers broke the
game open in the latter stages of the

.* '.i-.1'‘t

first half ‘by ‘pressuring the Provi-
dence offense, forcing several turn-
overs into easy baskets. However,
after being held scoreless for almost
five minutes, Providence found
itself at an advantage when Pitt’s
Miklasevich got her third foul with
six minutes to go in the first half.

Several minutes later, Pitt had to
deal with a Providence fullcourt
press that caused several Pitt turn-
overs. Tough rebounding, defense
and sharp shooting by Finn
enabled Providence to come within
one point of Pitt by the end of the
first half. After leading comforta-
bly by 7-10 points throughout most
of the first half, the Lady Panthers
found themselves up 36-35 at the

, end of the first half.

However, the Lady Panthers
came out fighting in the second
half. Sophomore forward Jennifer
Bruce scored Pitt’s first second-half
basket on the opening tip-off.

Pitt’s tough 2-3 defense forced
several Providence turnovers and
along with the strong defensive
attack came a strong offensive one
that enabled the Lady Panthers to
move out to a comfortable lead over
the Lady Friars. Guard Lynn Love
and Bruce ignited for several points
during this time, which proved
important for Pitt.

Sophomore Rhonda Gibbs and
Miklasevich both came alive offen-
sively for Pitt, which found itself
up 55-41 with 11:29 to go in the
game.

From this point on, foul trouble
was the name of the game for both
teams. Providence center Laurie
Buchanan fouled out with 9:35 left
to play. Pitt's Miklasevich then
fouled out about a minute later.

George Allen (11) and the ‘Panthers aren‘-t expecting a

Providence then pressured Pitt
for the remainder of the game and
forced several Pitt fouls and turn-
overs. With the scoring of forward
Britt King and Finn, Providence
again began to cut into Pitt’s com-
fortable lead. Providence then cap-
italized on Pitt’s inexperience
when Love fouled out for Pitt, forc-
ing coach Saurer to replace her and
Miklasevich with two under-
classmen.

With 2:42 left, Providence found
itself only down 68-61 due mostly to
an effective press and the shooting
of Finn. Providence’s Finn then
fouled out with Pitt leading by one.

Bruce drew Providence guard
Kerry Phayre's fifth foul and sank
two crucial free throws for the Lady
Panthers. Eileen Gilhooley, Maxi-
arz and Gannis each converted on
the foul line, giving the Lady
Panthers the final margin.

Coach Saurer commended both
Love and Miklasevich. for their
play throughoutthe game.

“ Lynn read Providence’s offense

very well, which enabled her to

make some nice steals and good
rebounds.” she said. “ Lynn made
several key points and played well
offensively also. Pam had a very
fine shooting night.”

High scorers for the game were
Finn and King for Providence with
26 and 18 points and Love and Mik-
lasevich for Pitt with 21 and 16
points, respectively.

Assistant Lady Panther coach
Carol Dugan summed up the vic-
tory. “ We finally did what we had
to do both offensively and defen-

sively. Having two senior starters .

foul out and having to replace
them with two underclassmen says
something very important for us
tonight; that is with the victory we
gained improvement in our play,
and we saw our younger girls could
come through for us when we
needed them to. Although further
improvement is needed, I feel as if
we have taken a step toward future
success with tonight's victory."

By scorr DELLETT I A 

Normally, the Panther ‘basket-
ball team's meeting with Lafayette
College tomorrow night at the Fitz-
gerald Field House would be little

more than a ‘tuneup for the rest of *

the «Big East schedule. However,
the Panthers have fallen into a rut.
For the majority of the 10 games
played, especially within the cozy
confines of the field house, the
Panthers have gone into the game
with a “just show up on the court”
attitude. ‘
“Every home game has been the
same,” head coach Roy Chipman
said after Tuesday's loss to Connec-
ticut. “We have to fall behind and
get our butts kickedbefore we start
to play. I can sense the attitude
when I get into the locker room."
Such a frame of mind may per-
mit wins against Westminster and
St. Vincent, but it may lead to dis-
asterous results against Big East

competition. This is the reason _

why the matchup against the 3-5
Leopards is of such great impor-
tance. After Saturday night, Pitt
will face Villanova, West Virginia
and Georgetown in a seven day
period.

“This is a very key game for us,”

Chipman said. “One reason is that;

I thought we should have beat
Connecticut. If we won Tuesday,
we could be 7-4. Now we’re 5-5.
That's a big difference." >

Spikers   Test sha

By MARK A. SINDLER

It is a case of an untested rookie
going against a seasoned veteran.
It’s experience against potential.
Call it what you want, but when
the Panther volleyball squad trav-
els to York, Canada, and competes
in the Excalibur Classic this week-
end, coach Ray Reilly will do a lot
of playenshuffling.

His team sports six freshman on
a 10-man roster. The matches the
Panthers will play against three
other teams in a double-pool,
eight-team invitational are the very
first of what will be their last
season.

In the meantime, the seven other
schools, including York, Ball
State, Waterloo, Toronto and
Manitoba are all passing through
the middle of their seasons. These
schools already have a feel for play-
ing among one another and have

~ that “ veteran advantage” over Pitt,
a team that is not_only starting its
season, but doing so with many
first-year players.

This abundance of freshmen
leaves sophomore Barry Goldberg
without much speculation as to
how well‘ the Panthers will fare this
weekend. A

“Passing will be the key to our
team,” he said. “I can’t really give
you any strong points because
there are a. lot of freshmen.”

What can be said is that upper-
classmen Tony Zortea, Dave Baird,
Mike Peatock and Goldberg will
indeed start. The other two spots
will likely see shuffling and experi-

mentation as Reilly sorts through,

the freshmen he believes will pro-
duce the best lineup.

It should be noted, however, that
of the four starters, only Baird
played fulltime last year. The oth-
ers served in a reserve capacity.

“We're rookies here,” Goldberg
said. “Baird is the only one who
played regularly last year. Ray
shuffled it around to find a lineup
that would click.”

* .621-1988

Of the sixfreshmen, one ques-
tionmark player is Mike Keating,
who is currently nursing an
injured foot. He is currently unsure
of, his status but will be ready to
play.

“Passing will definitely deter-
mine who’ll start,” he said. “As far
as our success (in Canada), Idon’t

know because right now those
teams are playing as a unit, where-
as we haven't had the playing time
to do that yet.”

If there is any one thing updii
which the Panthers can rely, it is
attitude. Indeed, it was no easy task
absorbing the news that the pro-
gram would not even be around

Anqulio Morales accounted for
another Youngstown win by beat-
ing Panther Frank Rich, 9-6.

Panther Kurt Karanovich took
Doug Brunot down in the opening
seconds of the first period, then
accumulated 4:54 riding time on
the way to a 9-4 victory.

At heavyweight, it was Rick Bru-
not of YSU pulling out a 6-3 win
over Panther Dan Kasperkoski.

Overall Pitt's coaches were dis-
pleased with several mistakes that
the Panthers made, but they were

happy with the victory.

Said Stottlemeyer, “The fresh-
men really wrestled well for us, but
we still_ need to do a lotof work. We
can _make those mistakes with a
team like Youngstown and still
win, but if we do that with Mis-
sourt, they’ll laugh us off the
mats.” '

The Panthers will now put last
night’s victory behind them as they
prepare to meet a much stronger
Missouri squad at Waynesburg
High School tomorrow evening.

someone’s finding out that he has a
terminal illness and has only a few
months to live. Well, the Panthers
have accepted it and will use their
winning attitude to fight the odds.

Goldberg said. “ It will defintely be

us to wrestle a Midwestern school,”
said Coryea. “We don’t get the
chance to wrestle teams of this
caliber too often outside of the

depends on how other teams play.

“But Ray's pretty_ good; he
knows a lot about the game.‘ The
important aspect for us is concen-
tration. We've got to keep rolli_ng
and after we get into games, we’ll
see how much momentum will
have to do with our success. It’s like
that in volleyball.”

Pitt will have its hands full as
‘Missouri comes off a 12th place fin-
ish last year in the NCAA Cham-
pionships and is now ranked 17th
in the nation by AMateur Mat
News in pre-season polls. -

Said Coryea, “They really don’t
have any major weak spots. It’s not
as if everyone on their team is a star,
but they do have their standouts.

“They definitely have a strong
team,” said Coryea, “but we think
we have a team that is capable of
beating them.”
