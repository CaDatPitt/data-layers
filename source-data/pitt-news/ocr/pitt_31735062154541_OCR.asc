The alarm was sounded by. an
unknown passerby, who_saw the re-

was answered almost immediately,

H. Clifford Carlson and'his gang of
Phantom Panthers have completed
another successful campaign on the

put of a‘ total of twenty-one
games with strong opponents, the
Pitt quintet lost only ﬁve. Among
the highlights of the season was an
overwhelming victory over West
Point, who had come to _PittS,l)urgh

tories over major eastern teams; a » -

ern trip of four games, the Pan-

thers got oifto a bad start and lost .

their first three. Butler, Northwest-

western quintets, defeatedthe Pan‘-
ther‘ by small margins.‘ The last
game of the tour with Ohio State -at
oiumbus, was taken, by a substi-
tute Panther team with little
trouble. The early.-season: trip found
the Panthers contending in crowded
halls during, an. inﬂuenza epidemic,
and the’ regulars‘ were so badly
st’r1cken,'that’ Carlson had to use a
substitute ﬁve in the last fray.

PICKARD Boosts“

 

Explains Failure: Of" Cinder-
: Men To Do Well In
Dual Meets

 

By Captain Vic. Pickard

The _University track and ﬁeld
team is perhaps thebest one that
Pitt has; had in recent years, but,
in dual meets, it is unable to-hold
much advantage. In fact, it‘ has
been defeated already this year by
West Virginia. Of course, it must
be remembered that a. limited num-
ber. of events were on the Moun-
taineer program. ' .

Thehmain reason for Pitt’s.” inabil‘-5

ity to show a vantage in dual meets -
is the fact-t at the team is. not a ‘

balanced one. It is in the weight
events._that the Panthers are. par;

ticularly weak at this time, with ‘

the exception,‘ of the hammer-throw.
m which we stillvhave the incom-

arable, Don Gwynn. Gibby Welch
cft a -gap in. the weight depart-
ment"tl_1a_t has been hard to‘ ﬁll.
That this condition will be, improved

bﬁforc 'the’outdoor season begins is _

conﬁdently predicted ‘by. Coach
Erank .$hea, who is working over-
tlme. _W;_th~ the men’. .

It is realized by the University
that the dual meets have an impor-
tant place on, t_he.;athletic p‘rog'ram.
Aut critics. maintain, that friendly
competitive rivalry with opponent
schools -forms: a. p 1
that is .almost- who‘ lyé lacking: in the
larger‘ college games. , ' ’

B0<?.Bts\'Big Meets

Unfortunately in. the past, Pitt’s ’

program, has been practically con-
ﬁned to the tn.-state district with
the result that only local recogni--
tion has. been gained, which is a
‘deplorable condition considering the
size1of. the University "of Pitts-
burgh. ..;_Ho.wever,. one. step has been
taken in the right direction this
year. 'W_1th« the addition of Ohio
State and Army to the program.
_In the“ national college meets,
P1tt_’.s increased stren'gth~‘will be
mostmoticeable. thislyejr, and suc.
