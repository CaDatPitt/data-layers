Engineering Complex
Construction to Start
During Coming Year

By CHRIS IVLARTDI
- Construction on the University’s new twenty million
dollar Engineering and Mines complex is scheduled to begin
within a year. The complex will rise on the present site of

Logan Armory on the corner of O’Hara and Thackery Sts.
after the Armory is demolished. The complex should be

ready for occupancy by 1968.

The structure, designed by
Deeter and Richey Architects, in-
cludes means by which the class-
rooms and laboratories can be
combined, divided, enlarged, or
reduced with a minimum of ef-
fort.

‘The General State Authority
of Pennsylvania willy supply for
the project over $14,167,000,

which will pay for the actual
buildings, The University will

‘ spend another $5,833,000 for

equipment, furnishings, and the
cost of erecting a new armory
in the Beechview section of Pitts-
burgh.

“This great need for expand-
ing facilities arose,” according to
Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld,
“because of the enormous in-
crease in research contracts over
the past few years, and the ex--
pansion of our graduate engineer-
ing enrollment.

 

 

 

THIS IS AN artist's model of the new 20 _‘ million

dollar Engineering _- and" Mine -_ complex. It  be ‘

, I built on the 151 acrejsite of the present Logan 
Armory_ which ss.=..i1_1 -be razed.  ;1z,‘ﬁoor\c§§!21.°?.'-‘    s  .

The University is presently
renting space in the Armory for
classrooms and for its audio-vis-
ual aid program. The building
will be completely turned over
to the University for demolition
as soon as the University has
constructed the new armory in
Beechwood, which has not yet
been started. .

i   hancellor

An official administrative reply to an
open letter written by student leaders to
Chancellor Edward Litc-hﬁeld squealched the
rumor that a scholarship cut is planned.

“There is —.no foundation for the rumor,”
announced Dr. Alan C. Rankin, vice-chanc.el-

lor of student and general affairs. “Scholar-
ships are not being cut for the winter and the

spring trimester. As a matter of fact, they are being
increased.

In regard to the projected scholarship situation
for next fall, which comes under next year’s budget,
Dr. Rankin said that “the only concrete thing" is
this year.” The budget for next year has not been
ﬁnalized. _ F

To ally student fears, Rankin said: “We can
not make commitments to students and then not
keep them. When a student receives a scholarship
on entering the University, we expect to continue
renewing it as long as the student remains in good
standing academically.”

The letter to Chancellor Litchﬁeld which
prompted the administrative statement went as fol-
lows: “In the last few weeks, there have been ru-

   

 
   

' —“the eleventh-hour withdrawal of the

elieved  
Squelches Rumor
roposed Student Aid Cut

  
    

mors to the effect that the University Administra- .
tion is planning to cut the total amount allocated ,‘

for scholarships by 25 per cent.
“The following factors have given credence to.
the rumors:

tuition payment plan, _ ,
2-“the recent article in The Pitt News by 

Zelkowitz, in which it was stated that there“ -

would be a cut in athletic scholarships,
3—“the official admission that faculty salary raises-

deferreclé; _

would be ‘more selective’ this year thanin the: _'

past, '
4-“the admitted crisis in the University budget."

“These rumors have created as general anxiety. .

in the student body. If they are without foundation,‘

you could allay our fears by officially stating  _.

scholarships will not be cut. '

“If, on. the other hand, the Administration does ]
in fact intend to reduce the allocation for scholars '0

ships, students should be notiﬁed immediately.”

The letter was signed by Irv Garﬁnkel, Allan; f

Schlosser, Norman Himes, Mike Marcuse, David?-

Narr, Richard Fireman, Bob Sorochak, Harvey Lefs. 1;

ton and John Vrana.

A motion was passed recom-
mending that the price for clean-
ing shirts be raised from 20 to 22
cents per shirt. The raise is
necessitated because the present
shirt cleaning service has been
subject to complaints and a new
service would cost more. If the
price is raised, the commission
to MDC would be raised from

SOMEBODYGO0FED.”

On Sunday, November 29, AlleghenylAirlines served over
5,000 passengers, including many PITT students. These

passengers flew one million miles on flights which were 94-

per cent “on time.” ’

This isn’t a goof—-—it’s a darned good record!

Having told you how well Allegheny performed on this
date, as we do on most days, We’d like to stop here. But
we can’t.

We can’t stop here because among the many PITT stu-
dents we carried on November 29, a few were seriously
inconvenienced. We’re sorry about this . . . and want to
give you a brief explanation.

Several PITT students returning from Thanksgiving va-
cation _were unable to board their Allegheny flight at
Philadelphia despite the fact that they held confirmed
tickets. In airline ‘language, this is known as an “over-
sale.” Oversales-are understandably irritating to passen-
gers and are viewedwery seriously by the airline. To the
best of our knowledge no scheduled airline knowingly. books
an oversale. Most certainly,'Allegheny does not.

By way of background on how our reservation system
works, A11egheny’s seat inventory is recorded on 3. Com-
puter. This Computer inventories the seats scheduled on
every flight for 60 days in advance. If the "aircraft sched-
uled for the flight has 52 seats—as most of ours do-—an
inventory of only 52 seats is stored in the Computer.

As reservations are requested, our agents activate the
Computer and’ check seat availability before confirming
the reservation. Once all seats on a given flight have been
sold, the Computer automatically refuses to accept any
more reservations for the flight.

   

We've been using this Computer for over a year now.

Thanks to its electronic wizardry Allegheny’s oversale 

ratio is among the best in the airline industry. *

Although our Computer’s batting average is just about

perfect, no one yet has invented a completely fool-proof A

human being. Unintentional and very. infrequent clerical
errors do occur in processing reservations.

Oversales also result from two other sources. First, offices

other than Allegheny’s sometimes issues tickets for our. 2 ~

flights without proper confirmation from us.

Next, passengers sometimes change their travel plans but
forgetlto notify the airline. When this happens, the airline
is required to cancel the passenger’s return reservation.
This may have been a factor in the November goof at
Philadelphia. We will not know this until our detailed

investigation is completed. But in any "case, we thought   7

you’d like to know the importance of keeping the airlines
informed if you change your travel plans. 2 A 

Having read this, you may wonder why Alleghenyis   

concerned. about the fact that somebody goofed in han-
dling the reservations of a few passengers out of many
thousands. ‘

In our business, one unhappy customer out of even a mil- .
lion is one too many. No form of transportation—from, 

Jalopy to J et—-can guarantee perfect performance all the
time. But we want you to know that Allegheny is-100 per

cent dedicated to providing the best possible service. We’ll 5  
welcome an opportunity to demonstrate this in the near ~ ‘—' “ 2‘ 9 

future. T r . .

ant enough to rate_half. a

and a twenty page spread

‘ in Life. It was not surpris-
’ ing, then, to see in The Pitt

News of November 20th.
(“Sartre Remains Subver-

-si've”)l> _an article. defending
 Sartre’s refusal of the No-
bel Prize and, more gener-

ally,‘ his philosophy. The
author was identified only
as Collegiate Press Service.
I take issue with Mr. Serv-
ice (hereafter called the au-

thor).

Sartre’s ideas are by no

0‘ means all objectionable, but
the article in his “defense”

speaks, in a too-typical fash-
ion, for some of those ideas
which are. The article con-
tains many misleading, glib

~ statements about philoso-
i phy in general.

It trans-
forms a defense of Sartre

“ into an attack on contem-

porary analytic philosophy

«for, according to its author,

one must be not anti—intel—
lectual, but only anti—ration-

Several of the question-

T’ able arguments which the

author employs will be ex-

, amined here.

“When a philosopher can

I--be.discussed comfortably . . .
or qui‘bbled over at profes-

sional colloquias (sic),” the

 author says, “he has failed.”
-_ This is apparently because

Sartre would not try to sell
his ideas to an unsympathet-

 ic or unattuned listener. He

must be accepted. on faith,

 intuited perhaps. ‘He fears
 discussion of the form (es-
" sence,~ as opposed to action
I on the attitude of his view-

p*oint.'Should, then, a good

iphilosopher be ignored or
 ifej ected outri'ght- jat collo-
Jquia?‘ :5 That {would be the
fonlly alternative one could
 ,i‘nfer\.¢ff,rom the author.

~enessm 

 

plimented for his pictur-
esque use of language. Still,
he crosses the boundary of‘
reason when he generalizes,
“The philosopher must be
the ultimate subversive.”
He must have said these
words to himself for a half
hour before setting them
down. They make good poe-

try, one supposes, but not

good sense. ‘

He also contends that Sar-
tre is only a philosopher
qua critic and moralist. But
then, so is Walter Li’ppman.
And Norman Mailer. And,
to carry it a step farther,
so too is Robert Welsh.

Another of his ill-con-

ceived arguments holds that

The Partisan Review’s read-
ers should need no philo-
sophical sophistication in
order to understand the tru-
ly “great ideas and intellec-
tual challenges” appropri-
ate for publication in The
Philosophical Review, I just
as The Philosophical 1‘ e-
view’s readers should need
no literary background be-
fore attempting to fathom
avant-garde poetry in The
Partisan Review. Like it or
not, it must,be recognized
that today there is a neces-
sary specialization in all
areas of human knowledge.
The author implies, though,
that philosophical sophistica-
tion is identical with literary
sophistication. ,

Unless one wants to ar-
gue along the evidently fal-
lacious lines that “man has
not risen above the primal
instincts of‘ his arboreal an-
cestors, as evidenced by the
bomb,” or that it is not prog-
ress to pass from myth, sup-
erstitution and animism to
relativity, the computer and
the United Nations, or that
the objective viewpoint is
never relevant to human
thoughts and endeavors,
thensone should not attack

‘..wha"t" the author - _designat;_es¥;., I

I»:

  

“speak only to each other,”
and to whom “the world
rarely bothers to listen.”

The author quotes a Pro-
fessor Gottschalk as saying
“something basically wrong
has lurked in our culture,
down-deep in‘ its institu-
tional " fabric, leading to
mounting disaster.” « This
resembles the vague, omi-
nous election campaign
warnings we heard not too
many weeks ago. But what
we needed allthe. time, the
author would no doubt say,
was not Barry Goldwater,
nor any chaplain, nor even
a judiciary or Congress (as
this would all be turning to
others, or what Sartre calls
“bad faith”), but only a
good dose of J ean-Paul Sar-
tre’s. philosophy of “Nau-
sea,” “Words,” “Being and
Nothingness.”

“Philosophy has become
an esoteric but proper dis-
cipline of no relevance to
the outside world,” says
Sartre’s defender. One
would be led to believe that
an investigation of knowl-
edge, of the sciences, of’
physical and mental reality,
of verbal meanings, truth
and judgments are as sup-
erfluous and obsolete as the
Brooklyn Navy Yard and
the B-70.

One of the author’s cen-
tral conceptions, that philos-
phy must deal only with
“concreteness,” presupposes
that concrete situations have
meaning apart from ab-
stracted values and concep-
tual frameworks.

Still, these are only ob-
jections to the article in
Sartre’s defense. Next time

_ ' 'To_o many_Americans believe that Charles de Gaulle -
with his. mystical conception of French destiny, his exces-
sive nationalism, his megalomania ——‘ represents the only
obstacle in ach_ieving Western unity. This view, which ab-
solves the_other Allied capitals from causing Westren dis-
a1‘I‘aY, maintains that if only President de Gaulle would
somehow vamsh from _the diplomatic stage, maintains that

:   __;_.~;... if only President de Gaulle would
1  somehow vanish from the diplomatic

‘4 stage, ‘all problems confronting the
 Atlantic community would similarly
vanish. This popular notion is sim-
ple, comforting —- and very in-ele.
vant. V

_ If wanting to be pre-eminent in
Europe is France's grand design, the
United States, by insisting upon ac-
ceptance of the ‘controversial multi-
lateral nuclear force (MLF), is also
4-  ' contributing to Western disunity.
SC1fD0SSF_1R The MLF, which calls for a. ﬂeet of
25 Polaris-equipped surface ships manned by mixed crews
from NATO nations, would be jointly controlled by the par-

    

 

 

’ ticipating countries (although the President of the United

States would retain the ﬁnal veto over their use). A
_ THE ALMOST FANATICAL proponents of MLF with-
in the Department of State — specifically Walt Rostow,
Robert Bowie, Henry Owen, and Thomas Finletter — argue
that their plan would have two advantages. First, the
mixed-manned ﬂeet would satisfy West Germany's desire
to have some control ‘over the N ATO nuclear deterrent.
And secondly, the MLF would check the proliferation of
nuclear weaponry. - ‘ _ 

Predictably, West Germany has been the only NATO
member to ‘endorse enthusiastically the MLF proposal. The
French, who are unalterably opposed to the MLF, have been
exerting enormous pressure upon the Bonn government.
In his recent Strasbourg speech, for example, President de
Gaulle warned the Germans against becoming an “auxil-
iary” of the_ United. States. Furthermore, the new Labor
government in Britain is cool (if not opposed) to the MLF.
Prime Minister _Harold Wilson has argued that the MLF
plan_ “adds nothing to Western strength, is likely to cause
dissipation of effort within the alliance, and may add to the
difficulties of East-West agreement.” . ‘ " ’

‘One fears that the proponents of MLF, if they are per-
mitted to prevail, will permanently damage the condition
of the Western alliance. ‘American intransigence on this
matter can only lead to a humiliating diplomatic defeat.
For as Manlio Brosio, the secretary-general of NATO, has
pointed out, every member has the power to veto any major
change in NATO’s present military organization. That is
to say, if the United States forces a showdown on the MLF
issue, the French will have no alternative but to veto the
proposal. The MLF fanatics, in that event, will either have
to abandon their pet project or establish it outside the
framework of NATO;

ALTHOUGH AMERICAN FOREIGN policy has never  

been known for its ﬂexibility, the time has come to junk
the abortive MLF concept. It is becoming increasingly ob-
vious that to insist upon the MLF is "to imperilfurther the
state of the alliance. The most important aim of American
policy has been and must continue to be the preservation
of the Atlantic alliance; yet inherent in the MLF situation
is a ﬂagrant contradiction of that fundamental policy goal.-

As Hans Morgenthau explained during his visit to the
University, NATO was devised against the milieu of a
neatly bipolarized world. Since N ATO’s inception in 1949,
the international arena has undergone profound change.
‘Whereas 15 years ago the sole danger confronting the West
was the presence of Soviet ground forces in Europe, the
situation’ today is characterized by somewhat of a petente
between Washington and Moscow. In addition, there has
been a diversion of interest to the problems of Southeast

‘ Asia and Africa.

It is not a new military machine (in the form of MLF)
that Europe needs, but rather closer economic and, hope-
fully, political ties. Ramming an ill-conceived military
scheme down the throats of Europeans is antithetical not
only to the needs of Western Europe, but also to the basic

goasl of American policy.

International Exchange

A scholarship fund, the Kennedy Award, has been

tional exchange. Theidea for the award was initiated by
a delegation of international students from the various

colleges and universities in Pittsburgh that went to Wash-

ington, D. C., last December to pay homage to the late

President.

The purpose of the program is
to establish funds to provide
scholarships for students to study
abroad. Its first intention is to
bring students from other coun-
tries to the United States to
study.

The Committee on the Kennedy
Award was appointed to ﬁnd sup-
port among students and mem-
bers of the community for the
creation of the structure of the’
organization. The task of the
Cormnittee will be able to organ-
mobilize support in order to
launch the organization in prac-
tical terms.

The fund has been launched
officially, as part of the Cultural

»_ and Educational Exchange Found-

 will feature reporters from vari- _

f
\

3‘

ation of the University. The by-
laws of the organization were
written and approved last spring.
This constitution sets up the

structure that should be estab-
lished to achieve the desire ends
and the methods of functioning.

The ﬁrst phase of the Commit-
tee’s work has been completed,
having developed the basic frame-
work, the procedures for fund
management and the ways to
fulﬁll the objectives.

They are now dealing with the
second phase of their assignment,
which encompasses the presenta-
tion of their work to the student
body. This will be accomplished
through the assistance of various
student organizations in the Pitts-
burgh area. Through their parti-
cipation and endorsement the
Cirnmittee will be able to organ-
ize their outline into an active
group that can effectively serve
the community and fulﬁll its pur-
pose to broaden the scope of.ed-
ucation,

  Recoiiers fromii Knee7Operatio1n  A  i E 7

By BILL CABIN
Wrestling coach Rex. Peery

A  ; said last week that his team

lacks depth, and “we can’t
afford any injuries.” This

 week, however, captain Mike
Johnson began recovery

from a knee operation, and will
be sidelined, possiblyifor the ﬁrst
half of the season.

Johnson is the team’s most val-
uable asset having won the 130

_ v poundtitle in last year’s Eastern
‘ f Intercollegiate Wrestling Tour-

nament, ‘and being named the

7-A   t6urnament’s ‘outstanding wrest-
-— ler. He has compiled a 25-3-2 rec-
/ 0rd in his two years here.

“I don't know how 7 long he’ll
be out,” said Peery. “It depends
gon how quick he recovers. He’ll

—_ four meets, and may rejoin the

team sometime in January.” The

— matmen’s ﬁrst four meets in Jan-

 

 

 

  uary are against Michigan, Syra-
 ,c'use, Michigan State, and Mary-

land.
.“I feel it’s coming along pretty

  “well,” said Johnson. “I hope I’l1- .

exercising daily in an effort to

‘ speed his recovery.

Johnson usually wrestles in 130
or 137 weight class, but Peery has
no deﬁnite plans for replacement.
“We haven’t wrestled-off yet,"
Peery said, “but Terry Sullivan,
Don Caslow, and Tom Heniﬁ are
all possibiltiies.”

The team’s outlook is not only
dimmed by their lack of depth
and loss of Johnson, but also by
a tough schedule. They open the
season against Michigan on Jan-
uary 9 at 2 p.m. at the Field
House, and their only other home
meet is with Maryland on Jan-
uary 30.

STRIATA!

The object of our. concern was a
small, wedge-shaped mollusk found in
southern waters where we planned to
lay telephone cables. _

Like others of its genus Martesia (of
the family Pholadidae), it is a borer.

“Usually it bores into limestone or
some other substance to ﬁnd a home.

Would it—could i_t—bore into our
undersea cables?

At the time, we .were testing " ‘the

performances of proposed dielectric-'

materials for undersea cables at various
simulated depths, temperatures and
ocean pressures. We also tested for
resistance to marine biological attack.

The testing showed that our cable
covering wouldn’t be attractive to
pholads, and in nearly ﬁfteen years of
experience with undersea telephone
cables we have peacefully shared the
ocean bottom with them.

‘But we had to be. sure we could. In

safeguard service from interruption. No
threat is too small. to ignore, not even
that posed by atiny mollusk.

and ﬁeld mice are nibbling on our wires.

squad. “I . don’t think I’m as
strong as Krieger and I don’t
know if I can be, but I have to
rely on my jumping ability.
Being so tall and thin gives
.LaValley an awkward appear-

ianc on the court. The coaches .

shutter when he dribblesand are

move to go around his man to
make a lay-up.

“‘I’m deﬁnitely better on de-
tense and have to work a lot on
ntiy moves: on offense. I made a
couple of jump shots .on Satur-
)4,5.ay night against Miami, and

five been working a lot on that "

shot. I missed some lay-ups be-
cause I banked; them off the
board too hard.”

.‘LaVal1ey is only 19 and a
sophomore and will have plenty
of time -to gain experience of-
fensively. “I have problems after
I get a rebound and start down
ﬁourt. I had the ball stolen a few

times’ from “me‘“agai-nst  I ~

don’t get the ball much because
the other guys on -the team are
the better shooters and I’m play-
ing mostly because of my height.”

“The coach said he was pleased
with the job I did on VPI’s Bob
King so I was put in against Mi-
 Rick Barry was .-too much
for me to guard so my main job
was keeping him away from the
basket and let the other 
help me out with him.” ‘

Timmons has been pleasantly
surprised at LaValleys hustle and -
has changed his uncertain tone
he had at the beginning of. the
season. “I need Jim in there for
his height and jumping ability,

_.but-he also hustles which makes
_him all the more valuable.” A

He‘ still has to learn how to I

-shoot— -because we lack» -«oﬁensive -

punch when he is in there,” said
Timmons. LaValley’s 4.7 points
a game average is the basis for
Timmon’s theory.
