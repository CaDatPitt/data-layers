iii survives exam

Review team praises academics, critical
of leadership and board of trustees

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

Pitt might have some long-
sought-after answers to what
insiders at the university say
is a negative image problem.

A three-month review of
the school, headed by an
expert from Northwestern
University, was released on
Friday, outlining sugges-
tions, pointing out weak-
nesses and portraying the
university’s strengths.

At his first meeting as

board leader in June, Pitt’s
board of trustees chairperson
J.W. Connolly said that this
report was going to be a
comprehensive review of the
university, one that shows all
of Pitt’s strengths and weak-
ness.

“We committed this report
in an attempt to find out
where we are as a universi-
ty,” Connolly told The Pitt
News on Friday. “It’s a can-
did, verbal snapshot of the
university.’’ ’

The 126-page document

compiled by image consult-
ing expert James Fisher and
a team of national academics
covers nearly every aspect of
Pitt, from criticizing the
large size of the 50-member
board of trustees to calling

-for a possible “house clean-

ing” in the athletics depart-
ment, one of the areas where
the university is consistently
losing money.

Besides criticizing the size
of the board of trustees, the
review was critical of their
support, stating that “the

percentage of trustees giving
to Pitt is woefully inade-
quate and the average giving
of those who do so is poor.”
“Pitt trustees should be
admonished to give, get or
get off,” the report stated,
pointing out stagnant school-
wide fundraising efforts,
which have been surpassed
by Duquesne University, as
one of Pitt’s weak points.

school with one fifth the
alumni of Pitt. has raised

Pitt professor chats with Pope John Paul II

By Beth Fisher
Staff Writer

When you’ve been just about all over the
world, it’s not surprising when you run into
a few familiar faces now and then. Dr.
Ignazio Marino of the University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center could vouch for
that fact.

On a recent trip to Rome, Marino met
and spoke one—on-one to none other than
Pope John Paul II. I

Dr. Marino was in his native Italy to
deliver lectures on transplantation. As an
associate professor of surgery, as well as the
associate director of the VA Medical
Center’s Transplantation Division, he has
been an invited lecturer across the globe.

But this was not the first time he has had

run—ins with the head of the Catholic,

church. In 1981, Marino was a resident at
Rome’s Catholic University of the Sacred
Heart when the pope was brought into the
emergency room after being shot in the
abdomen. And in 1986, while he was an

assistant professor at the same university,
the physician was one of a group of faculty
who met with the pope while he was visit-
ing.

“This time it was different, though,” said
Marino in his distinct Italian accent. “It was
more of a personal meeting.”

The pope delivered the closing remarks at
the International Symposium‘ on

Xenotransplantationz» Ethical and Religious _
Problems. (Xenotransplantation is the trans- 

plantation of animal organs to humans.)

Afterward, he met with each lecturer indi-“A”

vidually to exchange views and ideas.

“[The pope] is very supportive of the idea
of using animals as organ donors —— to sac-
rifice one single animal to save a human
being,” said Marino, who was a member of
the ﬁrst two teams to do baboon-to-human
liver transplants.

While the physician said that externally
the pope appears sick and old, he still has a
very strong drive about him.

“He doesn’t sound diplomaticabout
things he believes are right; he goes straight

to the point and is very firm in what he
says,” said Marino.

The physician said he shared many of the
pope’s beliefs, including the idea that medi-
cine should be used to help people and not
as a means to gain money.

“As a doctor, the greatest satisfaction that
you have is really helping someone.” said

_ Dr. Marino, W119 dBScri_be'd some of the

amazing re,cove~riaes‘ of.-_liver transplant
patients.

Marino has been with UPMC for almost
eight years now but enjoys returning to
Rome for lectures and meetings because
part of his family still lives there. A history
lover, he usually tries to fit in a visit to a
museum or archaeological site while he is
there.

And while Marino said working here is
“tremendously exciting,” he didn’t have a
lot of comparisons to makebetween his

. hometown and Pittsburgh.

“If you have free time, it’s a lot different
from Rome,” said Marino laughing, “but I
don’t usually have much.”

Local hip-hoppers [am at Piff

By James Ruﬂ"m
For The Pitt News

Bass pumped from the
Assembly Room in the William
Pitt Union lobby as a crowd of
about 500 waited in line in the
lobby. As the crowd waited,
some of the group members and
unknown MCs gathered in a cir-
cle to kick freestyle rhymes, giv-
ing the people in line a little taste

. of what was to come.

The Society of Urban Poets
gathered Friday night to put on
“That Thing,” a showcase of
local hip—hop ﬂavor in the
Pittsburgh area. The show was
straight East Coast, no gangsta-
rap here. It was all about
Pittsburgh MCs getting their
ﬂow on while exposing the audi-
ence to the rap scene in the 412
area.

There were even some old-
school elements, as break
dancers such as the Crew Jedi
Monks hyped up the crowd
before and during the show.

After the students payed $4,
got past security and grabbed
free refreshments, the show
started. The show opened with
Buddah, who got the crowd
warmed up. Then the
Forgottens, who have an album
coming out next month, got the
show going but left the stage
after the crowd refused to panic-
ipate. But Bam got the crowd
into its old-school style, having
them bouncing and shouting,
“Rock the spot!”

Next up was Math Team, who
brought a non—violent but hard-
core style. After Math Team was
done,_Organic Aura stepped to
the stage and kicked deep lyrics
over jazz tracks and hard beats
and then went a cappella at
points during the song. I

After Gary got on stage and
busted a phat ﬂow, the Bianis
stepped to the mic. A ﬁght broke
out in the back of the room half
way through the Bianis’ set. The
police came in and escorted sev-
eral people out.

After the show, Masai, head of
SUP and Strict F.L.O.W. mem-
ber, said that the purpose of
SUP, which was to dispel the
stereotype of rap concerts as vio-
lent, failed. “We try to do a hip-
hop concert, and somehow we
get some bad apples in the
back,” he said.

This happened despite the fact
that MCs B—Tree and Akil Esson
stressed peacefulness at the start
of the show, and 99 percent of

the people were there to get their

groove on.

After the police cleared out,
the show continued without any
further disturbances. Next on the
stage was Strict F.L.O.W, who
brought the East Coast ﬂavor
with a reggae twist. Strict
F.L.O.W’s album Trifecta should
be out by the end of this month.

The show finished up with
Demented Wordsmiff busting
his own style of dark, hard-core
rhymes. Then all the MCs got on
stage and kicked some more
freestyle to end the show.

over $100 million for school
projects in the past two
years.

Despite those criticisms
and others of past leadership
problems, not all of the
report was negative.

It cited the national leader-

’ ship of medical school and

the prominence of the
Honors College and pointed
out 11 undergraduate depart-
ments that rank in the top 50
in the country, including the
No. 2-ranked philosophy
department.

“The most significant fea-
tures of the review under-
score the academic quality
of the university,” said inter-
im Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg in an interview
with The Pitt News - on
Friday. I

One chapter of the booklet
focused on student life and
stated that, although there
was “immense pride” when

Vice President Al Gore visit-
ed the campus in September,
students interviewed spoke
of the need for an “esprit de
corps.”

“The overall quality of
student life is an issue that
the board of trustees has on

their agenda,” Connolly"

said.
' One idea Connolly said he
would like to see moved for-
ward on the behalf of stu-
dents is the successful com-
pletion of the convocation
center. ,
The portion on students
was also critical of former
Chancellor J. Dennis
O’Connor’s decision to com-
bine the office of student
and public affairs in 1994,
stating that several intervie-
wees said the department
was in a “constant state of
flux.”

pinions
Pitt really is it, sort of

Well, the polls are in, and we can now rest easier knowing
that the Official Report has been issued. The board of
trustees deemed it necessary to pay a nationally-known
image consultant to evaluate what is wrong with Pitt. The
trustees could have found out what was wrong with the
school just by sticking their heads out a window and asking
any student on campus. But students really don’t know any-
thing, right? So the consultant has compiled a 126-page
book of everything wrong. Now it’s official. Pitt is screwed
up.

While it really wasn’t necessary to pay an image consul-
tant to point out Pitt’s faults, the deed has been done. So
now the question remains, is Pitt going to listen to any of
the consultant’s suggestions, or is this just going to be a
huge waste of money and resources?

The consultant’s report listed just about everything we
already know: SAT scores are low, tuition is high, admission
requirements are slacking, student opinion is through the
floor, and the overall image of Pitt is that it definitely is
NOT it. In fact, the general opinion of Pitt seems to place
this school on par with an oversized community college
instead of a major public university.

There were, however, a few things that the consultant left
out of his suggestions. Despite the bitching we all love to do
about our beloved ivytowers, there are many positive
aspects of Pitt. And one of the reasons that so many people
have nothing good to say about the school is that the good
things are not given the attention they deserve.

The media coverage given to the university is quite often
only negative. And instead of playing up the positive, the
only thing Pitt knows how to do is backtrack and cover its
own ass when the negative is announced. But with so many
positive things on Pitt’s side, why doesn’t the university
emphasize those? How many people know that this school
has several programs ranked in the nation’s top 20? The
undergraduate philosophy department is ranked second in
the nation. The political science, history and international
studies departments are also ranked very high nationally, not
to mention several other departments. But unless you are
closely involved with one of these highly ranked depart-
ments, you probably had no idea.

That is because Pitt doesn’t bother to let people know. At
the very most, news like this might get a two-line blurb in
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette (on a slow news day) or possi-
bly a quick write-up in the University Times. That’s it.

If Pitt wants to improve its overall image, it needs ‘to stop

making stupid decisions (like spending money on an'image.

consultant). But it also needs to let people know what is
going on instead of just trying to pick up the pieces after
something goes wrong. The fact is: many parts of Pitt a_1*e it,
people just don’t know it.

ZBT's mistake is his loss

You may recall Zeta Beta Tau
frate'rnity’s banishment last
month from Pitt’s campus
because of a picture-taking scan-
dal involving three new brothers.
For me, however, it wasn’t just a
frat that was kicked off campus:
It was a part of my history.

You see, I’m a brother of ZBT.

Granted, I pledged in the fall
of 1981 (when the house sat on
Bayard Street) and hadn’t been
active since 1983, but it leaves a
hole in my soul, nonetheless, to
have that presence no longer on
campus. Since my return to Pitt]
three years ago, albeit as a part-
time night student, I’ve attended
pre-game Homecoming festivi-
ties up at the new house and
could actually sit with the guys
during the game (unusual for an
“alumnus”). I even considered
going to the formal this year.

All this has changed because a
few geniuses decided they had
to get pictures of women in their
birthday suits for a stupid scav-
enger hunt, and this came after
the fraternity had already been
put on probation for having a
keg in the house and other viola-
tions of underage drinking.

In retrospect, I probably
should have seen it coming.
After the bitter football loss to
Virginia Tech, I visited the house
to help the guys out with the
upcoming intramural football
season; I had a new defensive
scheme I wanted to try out.
While talking to about six or
seven brothers, the subject
turned to picking up girls, and
since I’ve never been very good
at it (and don’t really want to
be), one of them pointed to a
copy of Penthouse on the table
and opened the centerfold in my
presence. (Sorry fellas, but
naked women, whether live, on
celluloid or in a magazine, don’t
thrill me anymore.)

And one thing I can tell you is
that things haven’t changed
much in 15 years. When I
became a new brother, I heard
some of the older guys talk
about “the ultimate lay,” and my

 

Rick
Nowlin

little brother once declared that
his primary interest was in BMC
— which stood for beer, music
and well, you know.
Unfortunately, that kind of men-
tality pervades notonly frats but
also just about any male—domi-
nated social organization. I’m

- only surprised that ZBT was the

I’

ﬁrst to get busted.

On the other hand, the Pitt
chapter wasn’t the f1rstI’ve seen
disappear because of intolerable
behavior; ZBT’s house at

"Carnegie Mellon was dissolved

in 1984 after a major altercation
with that school’s Korean
Students’ Association. It too was
on probation at the time because
of an incident the previous year
when a freshman tried to break
the house record for consecutive
shot-drinking and ended up in
Shadyside Hospital with alcohol
poisoning. (He only tied it.)

But I think the controversy
points out a deeper and larger
conﬂict than is readily apparent
and which is certainly not limit-
ed to Pitt —— that between
administration and students.
College officials are rightly con-
cerned about possible lawsuits
coming on the heels of crimes
and tragedies related to alcohol
consumption (unquestionably
the college population’s greatest
vice), but most students proba-
bly believe, with some merit,
that they’_re concerned more
about the school’s image than
anything else. I remember a
rush party in the fall of 1982,
when some so-called friends of
one of our brothers started a
near-riot by pinching a little sis-

ter and subsequently attacking
her boyfriend, another brother.
All we did was push the trouble-
makers out the door, but these
jokers still wanted to fight. We
had to call the Delts, who were
having a toga party next door, to
give us a hand in quelling the
disturbance; two of them eventu-
ally had to be seen by para-
medics. Andy Smith, then direc-
tor of student activities, made

some huge production number 

to the media the next week about
how- irresponsible the Greeks
were, but he told us privately,
“There was nothing you could
have done.”

On the other hand, many stu-
dents live for weekends and
often choose cglleges based
upon their reputations as places
where you could have a good
time (at least, this was true in the
past): Years ago, West Virginia
University made a Top 10 list of
so-called “party schools,” and
when I was in the high school
band, some of my bandmates
regularly drove up to Edinboro.
a good two hours, just to attend
the bashes there. Greeks are
often singled out, I believe,
because they’re more obvious-
and more organized.

Add these to the mix, simmer
gently, and you end up with a
recipe for controversy that won't
die down anytime soon.

I’m not saying that my broth-
ers don’t deserve punishment:
after all, they did violate univer-
sity policy and should be held
accountable for their actions.
There is, however, the danger
that any heavy-handedness on
the part of administrators can
make_Greeks paranoid. When I
visited the ZBT house at
Northwestern University two
and a half years ago, one of the
brothers was convinced that they
were being run off campus.

All that doesn’t change things.
however. ZBT’s mistake has
turned into my loss.

Isles

f you thought Michael
Jackson was the only person
0 have a bad week, you’re
wrong. Here’s a few people who
would probably like to hit the

rewind button and start the week '

over again.

-The Pitt men’s basketball
team -- Valiant efforts against
No. 1 UMass where it went into
overtime and lost 79-71, and
against No. 4 UConn, losing 69-
63. Then there was yesterday’s
disappointing loss to Providence.
Now it looks like the only way
the Panthers will make it to
March Madness is by winning
the Big East Tournament.

°Kevin Stevens — All Kevin
wanted his whole life was to be
a Bmin and play in his home-
town of Boston. Well, he got his
wish after leaving the Penguins‘
(where he won two Stanley
Cups) last summer, and he pro-
duced a cubbish 10 goals in 41
games as a Bruin. He was also
benched once. His Bruins
stabbed him in the back and
shipped him oﬂf to sunny Los
Angeles on Thursday. Neil
O’Donnell, take note: lt’s not
always the best idea to go back
home. _ '

°L.C. Greenwood, Mike
Webster, Lynn Swarm and John

Stallworth — This quartet of for-

mer Steelers_didn’t make the cut
for induction to the Pro Football
Hall of Fame. Some say none of
them ever will make it. What a
shame, combined they have 16

Super Bowl rings.

°Some dumbass reporter in ,
Phoenix — At Tuesday’s media
day festivities, some reporter
asked Kevin Greene,“‘Do you
have any regrets saying the f-
word on national television?”
Answered Greene, “You’ve got
the wrong linebacker you bone-
head.” At least Greene didn’t call
him an f-head. We’ll leave
Greene’s digression into WCW

wrestling alone.

°Deion $ander$ — He was so
wonied about reporters misquot-
ing him, he taped a recorder of
his own to the inside of his jack-
et. And if they did misquote him:
“I do sue.” That pretty much
goes along with his slogan: “If it
don’t make dollars, it don’t make
sense.” Such is the life of a $35
million man.

Friars and Huskies latest to pick on Pitt

By Sean Duncan
Managing Editor

Blame it on poor shooting. Blame it on the lack of experience. Blame
it on the schedule. But any way it’s dissected, it’s the same common
denominator. The Pitt basketball team lost 85-70 to a mediocre
Providence Friar squad Sunday afternoon, as the Panthers extended their
losing streak to five games.

After dropping ‘two heart-breaking losses to No. l—ranked UMass and
No.4 UConn, the Panthers (8-8, 3-5 in Big East play) came out ﬂat and
got pounded in every facet of the game. -

“This is just a game that we got beat in every way, shape and form,”
Pitt Head Coach Ralph VV1llard said. "They really destroyed us on the
backboards; we didn’t guard their perimeter shooters. Obviously we
didn’t do things we needed to do inorder to have an opportunity to win
this game.”

Providence (10—7, 3-6) dictated the tempo from the opening tipoff.
Only once, and very brieﬂy, did the Panthers ever lead in the game. At
the 13:40 mark in the second half, seldom—used Jason Maile nailed a
deep 3-pointer with the shot clock dwindling down to cut Providence’s
lead to 51-49. Then Maile dove for a loose ball, pitched it to Jerry
McCullough and McCullough buried a trey in transition to capture Pitt’s
only lead. But freshman Jamel Thomas came right back down and hit a
3-pointer of his own to take the lead back for good.

Providence shot a sizzling 59 percent (10-for-17) from the 3-point are,
which, according to Friar Coach Pete Gillen, is a rarity.

“Usually we’re like Stevie Wonder the way we shoot threes,” Gillen
said. “We nonnally don’t shoot threes too well.”

Gillen, who saw his star forward Austin Croshere get in foul trouble
early, took a gamble halfway through the second half when he reinserted
Croshere with four fouls. Croshere responded with 15 second—half points
after not scoring in the first frame. With 11:25 remaining, Croshere
checked in andimmediately hit a 3-pointer. Croshere proceeded to run
off 11 of Providence’s next 15 points, including three 3—pointers.

Croshere’s last strike hit the Panthers like a Mike Tyson uppercut.

-After gaining some momentum, Andre Alridge hit a 3-pointer in the cor-

ner to tie the score at 66. But Croshere answered right back with a three
of his own. —

After Croshere’s trey, Providence went on to outscore Pitt 19-4 to close
out the game. ' _

Chad Varga led the way for Pitt with 19 points and eight rebounds.
McCullough finished the game with 16 points, nine assists and six steals.
Maile provided the spark oﬂ’ the bench as he scored 12 points.

‘‘I don’t know what it is right now,” Varga said. “Whatever it is, it’s

frustrating. We have to do some serious soul searching and ﬁgure out
what the problem is and make some adjustments.”

No. 4 Huskies survive turnovers, beat Pitt

For the second time in three nights, Pitt had a chance to knock off one
of the best teams in the country. And for the second time in three nights
the Panthers’ offense fell ﬂat in the closing minutes, which helped stretch

their losing streak to four games.

Although Pitt’s harassing defense forced 22 Connecticut turnovers, the

The Pittsburgh Steelers attempt
at ending their conference’s cham-
pionship garne losing streak at 11
fell just short last night, as the
Dallas Cowboys won Super Bowl
XXX, 27-17. ' ' _

Larry Brown was named the
game’s most valuable player, as he
picked off two Neil O’Donnell
passes, both in the second half,
both leading to Emmitt Smith
touchdown runs.

The turning point of the game
came late in the fourth quarter,
with the Steelers down 20-17.
Brown stepped in front of an
O’Donnell pass at the Steeler 40-
yard line and ran it back 34 yards,
where Smith took it across the
goal line on the‘ next play.

Brown also had an interception
and returned it to the Steeler 18-
yard line midway through the
third quarter, taking away the
Steelers short lasting momentum
and setting up Smith for his first
score of the game, one that put the
Cowboys up 20-7.

Brown, whose 10-month-old
son passed away earlier in the sea-

quarter and. Steeler backup left

- comerback Deon Figures recov-

ered the following on-side kick
that set up a 1 yard touchdown run
for Barn Morris with 6:36 to go in

The Cowboys dominated
almost the whole ﬁrst half, but the
Steelers went into the locker room
down by six and carrying the
momentum.

Aikrnan completed 10 passes in
a now at one point, including a 2
yard touchdown bullet to tight end
Jay Novacek.

After Chris Boniol’s second
feild goal of the game, the
Cowboys were in control, 13-0.

The Steelers first three drives of
the first half were plagued by a
stalled ninning game and a snap
from center Dennetri Dawson that
sailed over the head of O’Donnell
for a 12 yard loss. But on their last
drive of the half they were able to
put the ball in the end zone.

All-everything rookie Kordell

‘Stewart kept that drive alive by
- going up the middle for 1 yard on

fourth down, the second time he
did that in the game. With 27 sec-

_ onds left, O’Donnell hit a leaping

Emie Mills over the middle for 17
yards. The quarterback completed
the scoring drive with a 9 yard
touchdown pass to Yancey
