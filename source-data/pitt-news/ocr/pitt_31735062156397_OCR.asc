I thought during this ruckus,
that while it was certainly bad
enough to insult -a student in
such a manner, suppose the vic-
tim had been one "of the dis-
tinguished visitors who‘ frequent
the Cathedral, or a member of
one of those national investigat-
ing committees who inspect and

Time for[\Ac'|'ion

It’s about time that something
was done. The administration
should take drastic steps to im-
prove the status of ‘the men,

..who, are often the first contacts
outsiders have with the Univer-
sity. Or else the present crew
should be compelled to attend
classes in elevator etiquette, if
there is such a thing.

At any rate it’s time_ for’ a
change. The next student it hap-
pens to might ,forget to blush
and ~may give a counter-attack
to the elevator bully. -

is "very wrong. We’re_ told milk went up too much
in price lately I to continue selling it for ten cents
here at Pitt. I wonder where the New Kensington
high school "buys" its milk so that it still goes for
only ﬁve cents. _ ' '
Wh__af's in Hue Slaw? _ .

Remember, they receive no federal aid what-
ever, even for milk. Pitt I’m sure buys as large it
not larger amounts of milk per week than an‘aver-

' age high school. _

_ . And, what are we putting into coleslaw these
days to make it worth,25 cents here instead of ten?
And, how about some macaroni. and cheese or
scalloped‘ potatoes for ten centsone of these days?

Part of Pitt’s cost of maintaining the food serv- -

ices is said to go for the actual service rendered.
Well, there’s lots one could say about that. But,

the cafeteria be kept open longer for the evening

Shops, a‘ more varied menu of meat. for the even-

spaghetti and macaroni be available more often.

The Climax ’.

The crowning point of the serving system comes ,_

when you discover at the end of the line one day
. that the’ exact same things are served on both sides
of the cafeteria except one item. Salads!
Although there are trays and ice for milk and
jello in both lines, salads—for some incomprehen-
sible reason—are placed on one side only. For
heaven's sake, why?
To the entire ﬁasco, I ask why?

i 5   Important facts ubouttlte opportunitieslor       ”
as u Commissioned” Officer:-Pilot-,or Aircraft Ohserver-  
      in the United Stutes{Air Force  

Must lbe ancollege graduate to take Aviation ‘Cadet Training?

‘ No. But you must have completed a minimum of 60 semester
hours or 90 quarter hours toward a degree. In addition, under
the new Aviation Cadet training program, you must be be-

tween the ages of 19 and 26% years, unmarried, and in good__

physical condition—with high requirements for eyes, ears,
heart and teeth. ‘ » —

How long, before I get my commission?

60 calendar weeks. You will receive "the ﬁnest aviation training
in the world—-training that notgonly equips you to ﬂy modern
military aircraft but prepares you for executive and administra-
tive work as well. At the completion of your training, you will
have acquired a commission as a_ 2nd Lieutenant and the
coveted silver wings of the United States Air Force.

Where do I take ‘my training?"

, Pre-ﬂight training will be at Lackland Air Force Base, San

Antonio, Texas. Primary, basic and advanced training will be

. taken at any one of the many Air Force baseslocated throughout

-the South’and Southwest.

I What happens if I flunk the training course?

Every effort is made to help students whose progress is unsatis-
factory. You can expect extra-instructions and whatever 
vidual attention you may require. .I-Iowever, if you fail to
complete the course as an Aviation Cadet, you will be required
to serve a two-y'ear.enlistment to fulﬁll the minimum requirement
under Selective Service laws. Veterans who have completed a
tour of military service will be discharged upon request if they
fail to complete_ the course. ' _

What pay do I get as an Aviation Cadet? And after?
As an Aviation Cadet you draw $109.20 a month pay. In

addition, you get summer and winter uniforms, ﬂight clothes,_

equipment, food, housing, medical and dental care and insurance
. . . all free.» After you are commissioned a 2nd Lieutenant you
will be earning $5,300.00 a year__-with unlimited opportunities
fozzadvancement. ' .

Are all Aviation Cadets trained to be Pilots?

" No. You can choose between becoming a Pilot or an Aircraft»
Observer. Men who choose the latter will become commissioned.
oﬂicers in ‘Navigation; Bombardment, Radar Operation, or

Aircraft Performance Engineering.

Do Aircraft Observers get flying training, too?

‘Yes. Aircraft. Observer Cadets receive approximately 200 hours

' of “in the air” instructions. _The primary phase of Aircraft
Observer. training is the same for all branches (navigation
bombardment, etc.). The basic and advanced phases of training
vary, depending on the speciﬁccourse you pursue.

What kind of_- airplanes will I fly?
You will ﬂy jets. The Pilot Cadet takes his first instructions in

a light, civilian-type plane of approximately 100 horsepower, . '
then graduates to the 600 horsepower T-6 “Texan” before ’
receiving transition training in jets. You then advance gradually ‘

By ,WILL HLIVKO

An‘$850 batting cage in the Field House is rapidly devel-

oping into one of thebest investments the Ath1etic‘Depart-.

ment has made-at least so far as Sarge Mitterling and his -

Panther baseballers are concerned. -

For the ﬁrst -time, the Panthers‘ did not ‘wait for warm
weather‘ and the'"spring sun, but, instead, sharpened their
batting» eyes in the ~giganti'c.i_ndoor net in the Feld "House.

games at the Stadium.
A Cage Helps §Mittme‘n .

, Mitterling admitted that ‘he
thought the cage .would deﬁnitely
help his‘ squad and has saved val-
uable time. The short time alloted
outdoors now can be devoted to
intra-squad games instead of bat-
ting practice. ' .- .

Saturday’s game gave indications
that the Panthers may unfold a
few power hitters this season.,
Ollie Niemela, Bill Reynolds, Bob
Kyle, Milt Emery, and Joe Scalzo
will be the boys Sarge will be de-
pending upon for the long ball.

‘Last season the Mittmen drove

Move I Over Boys"
|I's Music Time

If the baseball‘ and track participants don’t mind the
intrusion on their rightful claim" to this space, we would
like to linger off the pacepto the subject of music. _

Music has its place in specialized types of operations
where: it is used toiset the rhythm. In sports Dr. H.~C. Carl-
son has. synchronized music to the art of foul shooting. His

to. key the hand -movements of '
foulwshooters by setting them to
rhythm. ,
Dr. Carlson spent» only a
few sessions with music and
- its far too early to judge the ‘
outcome. Agood example of
this ‘application, however, can
be found in another pﬁeld of
sport. Boyd Comstock, coach’ 2 V _ V p
- of Italian athletes in past Olympic games, ,was remarkably suc- A
cessful in training his runners,‘ hurdlers, and *' shot putters with
music. 7 ’

 

He noticed that these‘ athletes often sang in their moments_ of
relairation and__decided- to‘ make good use of ‘their innate “love of
music. Comstock realized that the feet of a ‘good shot putter, for
example, tap "out a deﬁnite rhythm, a good hurdler drums with his
feet as regularly and smoothly as though he ‘were following a
metronome. ‘ ' ' ' -
‘He had his hammer throwers listen, without looking,’ to the foot
rhythm of a thrower who possessed excellent form," incorporate the
rhythms they heard into a tune and use it as a guide for themselves.
In this way Comstock helped 184-pound Giorgio Oberweger
increase his discus throw from 46 to 48% meters and ﬁnish close
behind the hulking 250-pound champion in the 1939 Olympics.

To be fair ‘to Carlson it should be pointed out that he is not ‘

blessed with a musical outﬁt which readily separates crescendos
from diminuendos. In fact, only three members of, the" 1952-53
