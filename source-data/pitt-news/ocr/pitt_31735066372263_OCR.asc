Transplants OK’d

 

(AP) Six Pittsburgh corpo-
D rations have pledged the use of
their private aircraft to transport
donated" body parts for trans-
plant surgery at the University
Health Center.

“This corporate solution to a
difficult- problem will make

possibility for our neighbors.
The partnership willalso serve as
a national model." said center
president» Dr. Donald Leon.

Donor organs must. be trans-

ported quickly if a transplant
foperation is to succeed. he said.

Leon said the necessity for the

emergency flight group has
‘ygrown because ofthe health cen-
ters expanding efforts in trans-
plant surgery. Heart transplanta-
tion resumed a year ago and liver
transplants have been under-
taken since Dr. Thomas E. Star‘/.l
came to Pittsburgh recently.

The growing liver transplant
program at Children’s Hospital
has dramatically increasedtthe
need for donors. said Donald
Denny. director of organ pro-
curement for the University of
Pittsburgh‘s Transplant Organ
Procurement Foundation.

There may be only one or two
suitable pediatric liver donors
‘per year in the health center's

donor region. In order to under-
take the surgery. foundation
representatives have had to
travel outside the area a_t great
expense in time and money. he
said.

“By offering the use of uncom-
frnitted aircraft for emergency
organ procurement...the flight
group will make it possible for
the Health Center to continue to
offer a second chance at life to

those patients in need of organ
transplants." Denny said.

The corporations offering to
“assist the program are U.S. Steel

Inquest Reveals Facts On Stiekney

By‘ scor STONE

Stonewall Morgan Stiekney was
known to\be deeply in debt. con-
cerned about an upcoming criminal

J trial and seen to be “acting para-

noid” shortly before he either fell or
jumped to his death from Pitt‘s
Cathedral of Learning on Thursday,
Oct. l. A

Despite the testimony of l4 wit-
nesses yesterday. Allegheny County
Coroner Sanford H. Edberg was

. unable to resolve the basic questions

surrounding Stickney’s death. The
inquest will reconvene today at 1:30

Dr. Charles-Winek. ofthe Allegh-

fied that Mo.rgan's blood contained

_ a toxic level of Methaquaalone. He

trauma marks" on the body. evi-

While Winek said that there
would be additional evidence .to
explain this wound. later testimony

failed to resolve the exact cause of

such a mark. ‘
Questioning of witnesses under
oath by Coroner’s Office Solicitor
Vincent C. Murovich revealed that
an electrical wire. used to light the

Cathedral. had been present inthe
vicinity of the location determined
to be the spot where Stiekney either
fell or jumped to his death.

Francis Walsh. a sergeant for the
university's campus police force.
said that he saw an abrasion mark
on Stickney’s neck in a photograph.
On the following day. Walsh noticed
an electrical wire three-fourths ofan
inch thick in position above the l5th
floor ledge where Stiekney appar-
ently fell to his death.

Walsh further testified that the‘

wire was low enough for a person to
reach. but because it yvas connected

SGB Changes
Its Position
on Reforms
By CHRIS CLINTON

The Student Government Board
has endorsed a revised proposal of
the curriculum reform to present to
the Faculty ofArts and Sciences and
College of Arts and Sciences
councils.

At their regular meeting yester-
day. the board members said they
“endorsed generally” the general
education requirements proposed in
Sections IV. V and VI ofthe curricu-
lum reform package. ’

Under Section IV. students would
be required to take courses in litera-
ture and the arts. philosophy and
history to fulfill their humanities
requirement.

Section V is the social sciences A

requirement in which courses in his-
tory and public policy issues would
be mandatory.

Under Section VI. students would
be required to take a two—term
sequence ofa physical or life science
plus an additional science course in a
different area to fulﬁll their natural
sciences distribution. \

SGB president Bill Abraham
stressed that the board was not
endorsing everything specifically in
sections IV. V and VI; he said the-
board was endorsing the ‘sections
“generally.”

~ At an SGB meeting last week. the
board had decided to propose that
students take I5 credits in four dif-

ferent' departments in each of the F

three distributions (humanities. nat-
ural sciences and social sciences) for
a total of45 credits. After last Satur-
day's FAS meeting. however. the
student representatives to the CA
and FAS councils changed their
minds.

revised their earlier decision. Chip

No Improvement in
China’s Human Rights

By DIANE SCIULLO

Despite China‘s revamping of its
criminal laws in I978. human rights
in that nation have not improved.
according to Pitt law professor Karl
Herbst, who spoke Wednesday in
the Cathedral of Learning’s l7th
floor dining room.

Herbst‘s talk was part ofthe Asian
Studies Lecture Series.

According to Herbst, enactment
of China's new criminal laws has
worked toward ending class discrim-
ination in sentencing. Prior to I978.
landlords. for example. would be
sentenced in a different mannerthan
counter-revolutionaries for the same
criminal offense. ’

As the class reforms were being
implemented in I978. however, the
Chinese government simultaneously
had devised a new way of labeling
criminals that had looser class defi-
nitions, Herbst said. J

China's criminal justice system is
dominated by public or police secur-
ity. Herbst said; Public trials are an
extreme rarity, according to Herbst;
private trials are the main vehicles
for confessions.

In theory. China‘s new codes seek

to control the roulette-like granting
of trials, Herbst said. The new laws

suggest such improvements as

review of public security arrest
applications, six—month time limits
for holding a person without trial.
and rights to defense and public
trials.

In reality, said Herbst, these rights
are re-routed into waivers by the
accused because there is a lack of

rights.

Herbst defined political offenses
as any political thought in opposi-
tion to government policy that
makes one immediately vulnerable
to incarceration. Such information
as family background. Herbst said.
becomes crucial to determining who

is a counter-revolutionary. and he ,

added that there are countless
instances of individuals incarcerated
due to presumed disrespect.

“It is the authority of the public
security to administer sanctions to
criminals in ‘re—education.’ or labor p
camps. which is yet another way of
circumventing the right to trial,“
Herbst said.

“These camps are not country
clubs.” he added. “The frequent
practice is to retain individuals past
the three—year limit and retain them
as ‘free workers’ who must remain
the rest of their lives there."

The lives ofthe Chinese people are
better than they had been under the
previous laws. he said, but the
improvement is only a matter of
degree. China‘s legal system needs
anywhere from 200,000 to I million
people to operate properly. accord-
ing to Herbst, but the government
currently employs just l0.000. with
only 5 percent of the judges having
any legal training.

Sagan Protests Against Cuts

By PEGGY FERRI

The possible elimination of the
ll_,S. space program by the Reagan
administration put a damper on the
l3th annual Convention of the l)i-
vision for Planetary Sciences meet-
ing held Tuesday in Pittsburgh.

Dr. Carl Sagan. author of (‘us-
mos and president of The Planetary
Society.‘addressed over 300 Ameri-
can scientists at the meeting.

He said The Planetary Society is
concerned about “the possibility of
planetary exploration coming to an
abrupt end after a spectacular 20-
year period in which every planet
from Mercury to Saturn——— 40 worlds
including moons~ have been
explored by American spacecraft."

The Reagan administration is
seriously considering eliminating
U.S. space exploration from the fed-
eral budget. Sagan said. Another
alternative under consideration is to
cut the National Aeronautics and
Space Administrations budget by
I5 percent. including a cancellation
of NASA‘s planetary program; this
movegwould meet the White House
goal of full funding ofthe Columbia
space shuttle. '

NASA receives less than I percent
of the federal budget and the entire
planetary program uses only 3 per-
cent of NASA’s budget. Such cuts.
according to Sagan. would mean
cancellation of Project Galileo. the
only deep-space probe to follow the
current Voyager mission. which is
scheduled to orbit Jupiter.

New missions. such as radar
exploration of Venus and a visit to
Halley’s Comet. would be cancelled
outright. The Voyager itself. now en
route to Uranus. may be shut down.

If federal funds for missions are
cut. the money probably will not be
available from other sources since
public subscriptions or industrial

contributions could not foot the bill-

of several hundred million dollars.
Sagan said.

tion does. however. spaceexplorm

"'The European Space Agency.‘

France. Japan (the_v) are alljpst in
the throes of entering into explora-
lion." Sagan said. “The Peoples
Republic of China has announced
its intentions to do so. and it's very
clear that ifthe United States doesn‘t
do it. the human species will con-
tinue to do it."

The Planetary Society. which
over a year ago had only three
members-~—Sagan and two others—~-—
today has over l00.000 members
worldwide. It is the largest “space
interest group in the world and the
fastest-growing organization of any
sort in America in the last decade.

“We believe that this (the mem-
bership increase) demonstrates an
extremely wide interest in space
exploration." said Sagan. “In going
to meet member... of legislative and
executive branches. I found that I
got a very funny response. some
thing like. ‘We understand the rea-
sons why exploring the planets are
important and that it's an activity of
enormous historical significance

“Current fashions will include
light sweaters ranging in soft roman-
tic pastels, feminine blouses and lots
of lace.” Baldasare said.

She explained that long skirts will
be in style. especially the 3l—inch
split or “riding skirt.” This style

over into this winter‘s styles. She
explained that colors and accesso-
ries arejust a few important areas of
fashion.

“Bronze is very popular. From
belts to headbands to shoes, it’s the
most important and fashionable
color today," Lang said. “The con-
cha belt. a wide leather belt with
large. gold-plated ornaments sur-
rounding the front of the waist. is
also‘in.’The price forthe better belts
will range from $70 to $l00.”

To be at the top. a store must
provide the highest fashion and
present the merchandise in a way
that will catch the public’s attention.

“As soon as you have their atten-
tion and the customer stops.
whether they like the look or laugh:
at the extreme.-we have them going
into that department and that’s
what’s important." Greco said.

Not all of Homes‘ stores. 13 in
Ohio and Pennsylvania. carry every
fashion purchased in New York or
Los Angeles. Selected stores. those
with the most customers. are chosen
to show the most extreme styles.

“The downtown, Monroeville and
South Hills stores are categorized as
‘A’ stores. which-means that the
highest fashion is shown here
because the most people shop in
these" locations." Baldasare said.
“The more extreme clothes are
limited in their amount purchased

Those rumors of the return ofthe

according to Baldasare. The extra-

and will have ‘already been shown
this winter in corduroys worn with
full-length leg warmers.

Walsh testified that in his search
of the Cathedral offices above the
courtyard where Stickney’s body
was found. he noticed that a window
in Room H32 was opened “about 2
inches.”

A professor who worked in that
office reported to Walsh that the

‘ office had been locked and the lights

turned offon the night ofStiekney’s
death. Walsh said that the professor
was later informed by ajanitorxthat
the office lights had been turned on.
and the window left open approxi-
mately 2 inches. In addition. there
appeared to be a partial footprint on
the window sill.

ment to the best interests of the
students.”

CAS Dean Irwin Schulman

S attended yesterday’s meeting. He

praised the students for getting
involved in the reform process.

“I think it‘s good to have a dia-
logue between students and admin-
istration." he said.

After the meeting. Schulman said
that the students‘ original proposal
“didn’t stand any chance at all" with
the faculty. He added that students
still have a choice in the curriculum

preform.
SGB also reiterated its stance on .

the foreign language requirement.
Roth said the proposed language
requirement is a “divisive issue to the
faculty as well as the students“ and
that the students would not accept it.

Schulman said he “did not agree”

with the students’ stance on the

requirement. He said that the com-
mittee’s proposal is acceptable and
that the requirement should be left
as is.

The board also reversed its posi-
tion on culture requirement. At its
meeting last week. the board decided

to accept the requirement and said

students could take six credits of for-
eign culture to fulfill their

‘ distribution requirement-s.

But Linda O’Connor. FAS Coun-
cil member and student spokeswo-
man;said that proposal was used
only as a “bargaining chip” to the

< faculty.

In another curriculum reform
matter. the board endorsed a pro-
posal that called for student partici-
pation in implementation of the
reforms if they are passed. Of the
seven members on the implementa-
tion committec. the board said. two
must be stu-dents-appointed by the
SGB. Schulman said he perceived
no problems with that proposal.

“I think the faculty docsn’t have
anything to fear with students on the
committee." Schulman said.

said that the crime-scene unit deter-
mined that the print wasthat of a

one worn by Stickney at the time of
his death. In addition. Flannigan
said that there was a finger print and
a partial palm print. but that itcould
not be determined if they belonged
to Stickney.

Sarah Williams. a university
employee from Squirrel Hill. testi-
fied that she knew Stickney as a
friend and that he was “very con-
cerned"aboutan upcoming criminal
trial on charges of assault and reck-
lessly endangering the life ofa police
officer. She also said she was aware
that Stickney used drugs. and hadin
the past “ripped people off...and was
deeply in debt." I

At the time of his death. Stickney
had accumulated between 24 and 30
credits at Pitt. He was maintaining
grades that “were such that he was
advancing satisfactorily." Vrana
said.

Eileen Ma77otta and Madeline
Tsudis. both Pitt juniors. were the
last known people to see Stickney
alive. They noticed Stickney in Hill-
man Library sometime between 6:40
and 7:l5 p.m. According to Maz-
zotta. “he was acting paranoid.“

“He was outside the library when
we noticed him again." Mazzotta
said. “He was just running. like he
was very paranoid. Like he would
run and then he would stop."

Mazzotta said that Stickney
looked as if he were being followed.
but no one could be seen in the area.

Throughout the inquest. Edberg
attempted to draw a link between
Stickney’s death and ‘a “drug prob-
lem" at Pitt. He asked most wit-
nesses about the knowledge of Pitt’s
drug problems. but. he recieved
mostly negative replies.

Edberg will reconvene the inquest
today to possibly hear more testi-
mony and to reach a decision to
either rule on the nature of Stick-
ney’s death or pursue a homicide in-

According to a police statement
made after Stickney’s death. Willi-
ams said that Stickney debts “were
causing him. to lose the few friends
he had left." ._

Opinion

Playing  

Politics  

The Allegheny County coroner’s inquest A

held yesterday in an attempt to learn more

. about the death of Stonewall Morgan Stick-

ney was no doubt necessary, since there are so

many unanswered questions about the

incident. :

Even after hearing testimony, certain facts
about the case—such as where Stickney, 24,
jumped or fell from the Cathedral of Learn-
ing the night of Oct. l—are still not known.

But what was unnecessary about the
inquest—and, furthermore, was not even the
purpose of the inquest-—was whether or not a
drug problem existed at Pitt.

The drug issue was brought up again and
again by Coroner Sanford Edberg, who
asked almost everyiperson who testified for
his perception of the drug problem at ‘Pitt.

Why Edberg continually pursued this
point isn’t exactly clear. As coroner, Edberg
undoubtedly knows the territory his job

encompasses. Acting as a narcotics agent is
not one of them. ~

If Edberg were genuinely concerned that a
serious drug problem existed at Pitt and that
Stickney’s death was somehowbclosely con-
nected with it, he could do considerably more
than rail at those who testified at the inquest.
The people who were summoned to the
inquest did not expect to talk about a possi-
ble drug problem at Pitt.

What is more likely to have prompted

: Edberg’s sudden interest in a possible “under-

ground drug world”at Pitt is the fact that this
is an election year. Making accusations about
drug abuse at the city's major university is

quick to attract media attention, and Edberg

is surely aware of that.

Whatever Edberg’s_ political aspirations
are, we would hope that he would put them
aside and concentrate on unraveling the mys-
tery of Stickney’s death.

And if he is sincere in believing that a drug
problem exists at Pitt. we urge him‘ to make

an honest attempt toicall for an investigation

into it, or at least to make more than a half-
hearted attempt at suggesting it for the
benefit of the media’s attention.

And BrandyNew Hondas  

By BILL JACKSON

News item: Amid great debate.
the Faculty of Arts and Sciencesﬁisﬂ
considering broadening the curricu-
lum requirements for College of
Arts and Sciences ‘students. Wrote
CAS I)ean Schulman recently: “The
liberally—educated student is one
who is equipped not just for a job
but for life."

Curious to find out for myselfjust
how much a Pitt liberal arts educa-
tion does prepare one for life. I con-

’ tacte‘d two recent Pitt graduates to

find out .ho-w-their Pitt education
was working forthein. Fred received
a B.S. in computer science". and
George is a former liberal studies
major. Here is how my conversation
with them went:

Bi-ll: Gentlemen. I’m interested in
finding outihow your Pitt education
has prepared you for life. First of
all. what sort of courses did you take
as an undergraduate‘?

George: Oh. things like existen-
tialism. musicology. cellular repro-
duction. vice-presidential...rhetoric.
rI.atvian literature. aboriginal civili-

T/ation. and government and politics

of‘ Ecuad or.

B: How did these courses prepare
you for life‘? , .

(i: ()h. \\ ow! They helped me find
my links with the past and m_v path
to the "future. They broadened my
perspective by making me aware of
new ideas and foreign cultures. They
also helped me learn how to coin-
municate with my fellow beings. l‘m
great at cocktail parties. too."

B: What Kind ofjob were you able
to get with that background‘?

(i: I tend bar in Oakland.

_ ‘B: What kind of courses did you
take. Fred‘?

Fred: Computer science.

B: Is that all'.’

F: Some math. too.

B: What was your minor'.’

F: Phys ed.

B: And what kind of a job did this
get you‘.’

F: I'm a systems analyst for a
major oil corporation.

B: Does either one of you feel that
your Pitt education has helped you
to understand the world better'.’

(3: ()li my. yes! .I ust the otherday I
woke tip in the middle of the night
thinking about the historical com-
parisons between the Iranian and
French re\olutions.

F: Well. I don’t know much about
foreign cultures. but tlianks to my
math courses I can figure out base-

ball ,earned run averages now. and
the other day. using my computer
science backgroundﬁl cracked the
“Pac Man" program down at Video
Valley. ” A

B: One of the elements of the new
curriculum proposal is a foreign lan-
guage requirement. Did either_one
of you study a language at Pitt‘? 1

G: Yes. I took a year of Ukrainian.

B: Has it helped you at all in your
career‘? ‘

G: Not really. but I think I can
understand Latka on Taxi now. —

B: I)id you study a language at
Pitt. Fred‘?

F: No. but my roommate did. and
he taught me how to order a taco in
Spanish. Does that count‘?

B: Another part of the proposal
advocates mandatory courses in the
humanities. Have you had any
humanities courses that have helped
you somehow in life‘.’:

G: You know. it‘s ama/inghowi

much _I remembered from my film
and literature courses. Why. last
Saturday night I was watching Fan-
Ia.\'_i' Ixluml and was able to pick out
a poignant examplieiof religious alle-

gory. I bet that most Americans
didn’t even notice it!

F: I took a logic course on,ce.J._

think that because of it I was able to
solve Rubik's Cube in only one
weekend. A o

B: If you had a hand in writing tip
the new currictilum reforms. what

changes would you make.’

(i: I‘d make more interdiscipli-
nary courses available. like “The
History of the I’sychology of Politi-
cal Science“ and “Organic Chemis-
try’ in Film and literature."

F: I think three-credit study halls

. would go over real big.

B: Finally. what has a liberal arts
education at Pitt meant to you as a

’ person'.’

G: Bill. most of all. my tiineat Pitt
helped me to understand what the
human experience is all about. I
think that I‘ve grown to understand
the ultimate aim of life. why I‘m
here. and where ‘my niche in the
world is.

F: All that‘s importantato me is
that I got me a good job and a brand
new H onda.a nd I can go out and get
drtink any..night I feel like it.

Looking Again At Sadat

Dear Editor:

In response to last Monday's edi-
torial. “Sadat‘s Vision," I should like
to emphasize a couple of things con-
sistently overlooked by the likes of
Ted l(oppel and his media contem-
poraries of whom your editorial
seemed to be founded.

First of all. there are those who
sincerely believe that Sadat’s negoti-
ations with Israel were not primarily
contracted in the name of Middle
Eastern peace but rather for his own

(and that of his country’s) interest in
regaining the Sinai Peninsula lost in
the war with Israel back in I973.
The American media has also
failed to emphasize the possible link
between the assassination and
Sadat‘s incarceration of some 2.()()()
Egyptian dissidents a short time ago.
In my mind, this fact alone raises the
question of Sadat's worthiness of so
much praise as bestowed by the
American media. '

tion has led to the growth ofa grass-
roots opposition movement that has
three principal well—springs.

“First. there is the medical com-
munity. Doctors. nurses. psycholo-

health fields have begun to realize
that the administration is serious

‘about preparing for a nuclear war.
and it is apparent to many of them
that this policy is esserpitially insane.

“A nuclear conflict that produced
20 million casualties. a low figure by
many estimates. would create a_med-

dimensions. .

“Physicians realize this. and they
are now speaking out on this issue. I
think it is encouraging because of
their natural credibility. People
listen to doctors; it's not as iftheyare

“Secondly. the religious commun-

ethical questions that attend this

been especially active in various

parts of the country. protesting the ‘

shift iniawareness on the part of
many, people fromthe abstracttothe
tangible.

“You see the most activity around

areas where nuclear weapons activ-
ity occurs. The reason. I think. that
the MX missiles were not deployed
in Nevada or Utah is because of an
enormous groundswell of public
opinion in those states against the
plan. We’re seeing the same thing
here in Wisconsin where the Navy is
planning toiput a communications
system for nuclear warheads in one
of their bases. .
.. “That is the whole thing right
now. We have got to build a move-
ment on the grass-roots level. and I
think these concrete examples ofthe
threat posed by nuclear weapons
will help to build that movement.

crete example worked for the anti-
nuclear power people was ‘Three

computer error. This sort ofthing. if
it was better publicized. would force
politicians to take this issue more
seriously. _

“As far as other parts of the coun-
try. where the nuclear war-heads
industry is less visible. most people
do seem to thinkithat increased
defense spending is good for
employment. In Pittsburgh. for
example. the corporations have a
large interest in defense contracts.
and because the steel industry has
declined in that area. many people
believe that more spending will
mean morejobs for them. In reality.
that spending will benefit a relatively
few corporate executives and high
technology ‘scientists. Today’s
defense industry is not what it was in
World War lI...these weapons sys-
tems are much more sophisticated.
If we can make that point. then. I
think the thing will really begin to
take off. ,

“Activism alone. however. will
not bring all of these interests
together. As it stands. there arethree
basic groups in.vol\‘ed in opposing
the nuclear build-up. First there are
the traditional pacifist groups. who
oppose war per se. They are. for the
most part. located within the reli-
gious community. There are the
environmentalists who have realized

mnlinued from page one
has rushed for l00-plus yards twice
this season, including his I35-yard
effort against Notre Dame last week.

Complementing Williams is
Whiting, a 6-2, 2l0-pound bull that
Bowden call “a good oi‘ country
fullback."

“He runs as well as he blocks. He’s
probably the most solid football
player we’ve got,” Bowden said.

The Seminoles also return sage
senior quarterback Rick Stockstill,
a player short on ﬂash and long on
competency.

“His stats aren't pretty, but the
passeshe throws go for touchdowns.
He’s effective." Bowden said.

Stockstill’s favorite target this.

season has been wide receiver Den-
nis McKinnon, who enters tomor-
row’s game with I9 receptions.
Rather than throw deep often the
Seminoles employ a controlled pass-
ing attack. In their first five games,
they’ve displayed a propensity to
pass often to their backs on short
swing and flare patterns. After
McKinnon, Whiting is second on
the team in receptions with I’).

“They like to go to a lot of screen
passes and sprint draws, I expect
them to be explosive,“ said Pitt line-
backer Rick Kraynak. “We have to
be wary of backs swinging out ofthe
backﬁeld. We have to be on our toes
on defense. We have to read, key,
and react to the ball.”

Defensively, the Seminoles lost a
host of starters to graduation. but
like Pitt, their new starters have
stepped in to perform- admirably at
times. Gone is two-time All-
America noseguard Rod Simmons,
but James Gilbert, a 6-foot. 250-
pound fireplug, has stepped in to
clog the middle.

The defensive front also boasts a
fine pass rusher in Alphonso Car-
reker, a 6-6, 250-pound tackle. At
linebacker, the Seminoles have
speed in both big-play artist Ken
Roe and converted running back
Tommy Young. who recorded 15

- tackles in the Notre Dame win.

Still, the Seminole defense is
guilty of giving up big yardage.

Florida State Quarterback Ricky Stockstill is back to terrorize

Pitt’s defense.

Nebraska ran overthe Seminoles for
400-plus yards rushing and two
weeks ago, Ohio State‘s Art Schlich-
ter ripped FSU for‘ 458 yards
passing.

All of which should be good news
for the Pitt offense, which returns
ﬂanker Dwight Collins at full
strength and quarterback Dan
Marino still slightly under par
because of the shoulder injury that
kept him out of last week’s West
Virginia game.

Though Marino has regained full
motion in his throwing arm, his
passes in practice this week lacked
the accustomed zip over distances
beyond 20 yards. Also a concern is
how much Marino’s timing with his
receivers has suffered after two
weeks of minimal practice. While
Marino’s effectiveness may be
questionable—he admits he is still

less than l00 percent physically-

there is no question he will start
tomorrow’s game.

“He'll play,” Sherrill said ada-
mantly at Tuesday’s Pitt press
luncheon. “This is a very important
game for us, forthe team,and for the
city of Pittsburgh.”

“We're not going to let him be a

prima donna. He‘ll play." Shfiffm
said.

According to Sherrill, the Pitt of-
fense will have to run the ball effec-
tively and be successful throwing
underneath FSU’s safeties, who take
exceptionally deep drops in their
pass coverages. ~ V

Defensively, Sherrill says the play
of Pitt's linebackers Sal Sunseri and
Kraynak, and drop ends Michael
Woods and Chris Doleman, could
go a long way toward deciding Pitt‘s
fate tomorrow. FSU’s penchant for
counters, play-action passes, draws
and short passes should-test all four
players’ ability to read plays and
drop off into pass coverage.

“West Virginia is one thing. but
Florida State is quite another,"
Sherrill said. “We can't play conser-
vative and work for field position

‘with them because Stark can simply

swap ends with the football with one
punt. As a whole, their team plays
extremely well. They're a confident
football team with some excellent
weapons.”

The same asessment could apply
to Pitt. which is packing an extra
weaponwrevenge. ’

Booters Get Back on Track, Dump Youngstown, 4-.1 .

By LISA GRENEVICKI

After a three-game absence, the
Pitt «soccer scoring attack finally
came alive Wednesday as the Pan-
thers soiandly defeated Youngstown
State 4-]. Junior John Hagenbuch
stood out offensively with a second-
half goal and two assists.

Pitt struck first on the inexpe-
rienced Youngstown squad when
sophomore winger Gerry Wasson
scored five minutes into the game.
Hagenbuch picked up the assist.

The score was set up by Wasson
and Hagenbuch, who weaved
through the Youngstown defense
and moved the ball down the field
with some slick passing. After beat-
ing the lone remaining defender,
Hagenbuch passed the ball to Was-
son, who scored on a shot that spun
off the hands of the Youngstown
goalie and went into the net.

Just‘ l5 minutes later, Panther
junior Troy Norton took the ball
down the field and ‘d on a hard
shot that again hi "s hands"
and bounded into the net.

However, Pitt played inconsist-
ently for the rest of the period and
the first half ended with Pitt leading
2-0. '

Pitt picked up its aggressive scor-
ing attack in the second half.

Roth photo

John Hagenbuch scored one goal and assisted on two others in Pitt’s 4-1

victory over Youngstown.

With seven minutes gone. fresh-
man striker Jim Steele scored his
second goal of the season and

Hagenbuch picked up his second

assist.

On a breakaway. Hagenbuch
faked a defender and chipped the
ball in front of Steele, who booted it
into the corner of the Youngstown
goal.

At the l7-minute mark, senior Al
Adelmann chipped the ball over the
Youngstown defenders and drew
their goalie out of the net. With the
Youngstown keeper caught out of
position. Hagenbuch headed a high.
bouncing ball into the net for his
second goal of the season. making
the score 4-0 in Pitt‘s favor.

Pitt’s standout goalie. Scott
Thunberg. had an easy time shutting
out the Youngstown attack, before
giving way to freshman goalie Dave
Ghilani in the second half. Ghilani
continued the good defensive play.
but with just 52 seconds remaining
in the game, Youngstown spoiled
Pitt‘s shutout bid with a goal on a
disputed call.

The Panther team thought that a
Youngstown player was offside and
thus relaxed. but play continued.
Ghilani came out of the goal to

Don Bowen’s offensive skills as well as defensive prowess have been instrumental to Pitt’s

soccer team.

Bowen, Hiembach Man Defense

By PAMELA GATTO

The difference between offen-
sive and defensive players on a
soccer team isn’t all that obvious
from a spectator‘s point ofview.
According to Pitt Panther defen-
sive backs Karl Heimbach and
Don Bowen. the difference is
quite clear, especially when
they‘re on the field.

“We play the waiting game."
said Bowen. a sophomore
sweeper back. “Speed is impor-
tant for anyone on the team. and
the forwards probably do the
most running. But when you‘re
playing defense. you've got to
know when to go hard."

the defense plays too hard. “our
mistakes stand out much more.
mistakes which cause the other
team to score,” Heimbach said.

As defensive backs.
Bowen and Heimbach agree the
job requires certain physical
attributes in addition to the men-
tal rigors of the position, which
stress aggressiveness and
patience simultaneously.

Both Bowen and Heimbach fit
the bill ofthe stereotypical soccer

tenacity.

j Field Hockey

By MARlE HUFF

The list of adjectives that could
describe Dee Dee Kantner is phe-
nomenal. As a matter of fact. the
word phenomenal is probably the
best one. Kantner. a senior. has
played four exceptional years of
field hockey forthe Pitt Lady Panth-
ers. She also put in a year each on the
Pitt varsity track and basketball
teams. She is probably one of Pitt‘s
finest all-around women athletes in
the history of the school.

“I don’t feel I have an image to
uphold." says Kanter. “I _just haveto
be myself. and l have to enjoy what
I'm doing.“

Kantner certainly enjoys field
hockey. Since her freshman year in
high school. Kantner has partici-
pated in a field hockey camp some-
where every summer. For the past
three summers. she has been in the
U.S. Olympic team‘s developmental

camp. joining a group of the coun-

 

we

 

try’s elite field hockey players.
Kantner paid for her first visit to the
camp after her freshmen yearat Pitt.

‘and has since worked her way up to

the “B“ squad level.

“I really enjoyed the camps.” said
Kantner. “They were a lot of work.
but they were a lot of fun. I’m going
to miss them.”

Time and _ money won‘t permit
Kantner to attend the camp again
this summer. instead. she has shifted
her energies to another goal
graduation. Kantner is working
towards a degree in mechanical engi-
neering and expects to graduate at
the end of the summer. From there.
she‘s not sure what course her life
will take.

“ldwould like to coach a field
hockey team if I could.” says
Kantner. “Myjobwill probably dic-
tate when. where. and if I do(coach)
though. Right now. getting a job is

the most important thing."

School is not the only thing that
keeps Kantner busy. She is a certi-
fied field hockey official. and is cur-
rently working towards receiving
certification as a basketball offieial._
You can also find Kantner at Oak-
land’s Body Technics gym. where
she is a Nautilus instructor.

I work out three times a weckjust
to relax." said Kantner. “it helps me

Kantner has also run a field
hockey clinic for nearby
Winchester-Thurston. a private
Shadyside girl‘s school. She cer-
tainly has the credentials.

in her freshmen and sophomore
years at Pitt. she was selected a
Mideast third team allstar. Last
year. Kantner jumped to the
Mideast allstar first team squad. In

- I979. she was the teams Most Valua-

ble Player and she has captained the
Lady Panther squad for three years.
And she‘s managed to excel despite
playing under four different coaches
in her four years at Pitt.

“It is really hard to get used to a
eoach‘s style.” says Kantner. “I just
tried to play the game the best l
could."

Her best is very good. as Kantncr's
latest coach. Cindy DiGiacomo will
attest. l)iGiacomo has nothing but
praise for Kantner.

After a three—week record of lo-

what’s; his face for the Post-Gazette.
here's another round of my fearless
picks.

Florida State at Pitt: The betting
line gives the Seminoles seven
points. Considering that Florida
State is coming off impressive wins
on the road. the bet appears sound.

But Pitt’s Dan Marine is back. and .

the explosive Panther offense will _be
enhanced with the long-awaited
return of a. healthy Dwight Collins.

The Seminole ground game will
test the tough Panther defense.
Michael Whiting is a good quick

‘fullback. and quarterback Ricky

Stockstill is a dynamite passer. The
Seminoles also have Rohn Stark.
who buried Pitt last year with some
booming punts.

Look for a close first half. and
watch Pitt pull away in the second.
Take Pitt minus seven—--Pitt 28,
Florida State I7. « 2

Penn State at Syracuse: The
Orangemen usually play the Nittany
Lions tough. Syracuse's Joe Morris
and the loud Carrier Dome could
pose some problems for Penn State.
But the Orange has a woeful passing
attack. and the defense is porous.

CC Teams
Visit WVU

Pitt's men’s and women's cross
country teams travel to Morgan-
town Saturday to compete in the
West Virginia Invitational against
one of the largest fields either team
will face this season.

Leading the way for the Panthers
are sophomore Todd Colas, who led
Pitt with a l7th place at the recent.
Eastern 8 championships. and
rapidly improving freshman Mike
Boykins. For the Lady Panther
team. the two headliners are senior
Margie Lee and junior Sa||y‘Hig-
gins. the Veterans of the Pitt
womcn‘s team.

One of the more formidable foes
in the men's field is host West (Vir-
ginia. second-place finishers in the
Eastern 8 team championship stand-
ings. As always. the arch-rival
Mountaineers figure to be
unfriendly hostsanytime a Pitt team
visits. ‘I

The l.adyvPanthers women's team
will be going up against the greatest
number of teams they'll see at once
all year. according to-Coach Elbert
Kennedy. Like their male counter-
parts. the WVU women promise to

{ﬂfer Pitt some stiff opposition.‘

"West Virginia is always good
competition." said Kennedy. “It will
probably be one of the largest meets
we’ll run at this year .wit.h competi-
tion from clubs as well as schools.“

which makes Kantner wistful.

“I really enjoyed basketball." said
Kantner. “It was my favorite sport in
high school."

Still. playing three different sports

Kantner exceptional.

I)ee Dee Kantner is the type of

athlete most college coaches , only

PittTips Off Hoop Practice  

The Pitt basketball team began
practice last week under the watch-
ful eye of second-year coach Dr.
Roy Chipman. Chipman must be
elated that practice has begun so

'early for he has a huge task_on his

hands.‘Gone from last year's Eastern
Eight championship team are four
starters including All-World player
Sam Clancy.

The only returning starter is point
guard Dwayne Wallace. who will be
counted on to direct the Pitt offense.
As hard as Chipman'sjob will be. he
must be reassured by the fact that he
had the best recruiting class in the
Eastern Eight. Top incoming fresh-
man include Chip Watkins. George
Allen. who won't be practicinguntil
December. and Andree Williams.

Junior college transfer Roosevelt
Kirby and South Alabama transfer
Billy Colberstone should also count
heavily in Chipman‘s plans.

The key returning players are
Darrell Gissendanner, Clyde
Vaughn and Steve Beatty. Gissen-
‘danner- co-captain with Wallace.
came on strong at the end ofthe year
with clutch shooting. especially in
the playoffs. '

Gissendanner is coming offa bril-

fair team. withisome good players at
some spots. but I would have liked
to beat them more decisively."

Bemis made some personnel
changes in the midfield during the
game with which ‘he said he was
pleased. Jim Hackworth was moved
from fullback to center midfield and
freshman Jeff Dunn took over the
vacated fullback position.

‘“We’ve been out-headed, in the
midfield and I wanted a bigger and
more aggressive player in there."
said Bemis. “Hackworth adjusted to
his new position well, especially in
the second half."

The Panthers will need to be
aggressive when they host Edinboro
tonight at Pitt Stadium. Game time
is 7:15. Edinboro beat the Panthers
last year 4-0 and .l.T. Martin, the
man that scored all four Edinboro
goals. will be returning.

Edinboro is just l-4 this season.
but their losses have come at the
hands of some tough teams. includ-
ing Shippensburg State and defend-
ing Division ll champion Lock
Haven.

“Edinboro‘s record is not overly
impressive. but you have to look at
who they’ve played,” Bemis said.
"'They‘re returning a lot of good
players and they have a solid
defense.”

The Panther hooters will have a
lot on the line tonight. If they can
beat Edinboro and then Indiana

‘State down the road, they could win

the West Penn Conference cham-
pionship to cap a successful. win-
ning season.

“We‘ll have to get together and
play our game.” said Bemis. “We
still need to score more goals. We
went up there last year with a good
record and Edinboro whipped us.
The guys remember that and they’ll
be out to return the favor." . '

unit." stated Heimbach. “We
have to back up each other.
Johnny (Hagenbuch) is the right
halfback I pair with. Balance is
so important out there.“

What about the balance
between offense and defense‘?

“WelI,”smiled Bowen, “there's
not nearly as much glory in keep-
ing the other team from scoring
as in scoring itself. People get
more excited when the ball goes
in the net.”

Though Heimbach acl<nowl—
edges that offensive players get
more recognition, he maintains
that a player gets just as much
satisfaction playing good
defense.

“When you play defense, you
appreciate people who know the
defensive approach and they can

appreciate what you’re doing out
there," Heimbach said. “Keeping
the other team from scoring is a
great feeling. the whole unit
takes pride when we have a shut
out."

Pride and playing as a unit are
two ofthe factors that have made
the Panthers a winning team this
season. Over halfway into the
season, this year’s team has taken
a big step toward its goal of an
above .500 year. Its a step that

according to both players.

“There's a much better atti-
tude this year. We’re winners for
a change. We’re starting to play
with I I0 percent," Heimbach
said.

Bowen agreed. “We’re a much
smarter team, with better
morale. Nobody likes to lose. It's
total out there. Its got to be."
