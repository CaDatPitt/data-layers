such..as they are after a panoramic glimpse of America.

Wet Campus Study

By BUD O’

MALLEY

Suggestions were made to initiate a new investigation

concerning the feasibility of li

quor on the campus at Mon-

day’s meeting of the Student Government Assn. _
The university’s policies concerning liquor on campus

were established by the Board

duct such an investigation then!
Complete results of these prior
studies, are not yet available, it
was reported.

Plans for Fall Convocation, to
be held Oct. 14, were also dis-
cussed at the meeting. Chan-
cellor Litchﬁeld will be the
principal speaker at the event.
The Chancellor is tentatively
scheduled to deliver a “State of
the University” address concern-
ing major facets of university
life.

.»All classes will be dismissed
at 10 a.m. on that occasion, so_
that all students and faculty
members may attend the Conven-
tion.

Jack Markowitz, , chairman of
the elections committee, reiterated
at the meeting that the Pitt Ac-
ion Party will not be permitted
to participate in this fall’s stu-
dent elections. .

PAP has been barred from
participation in the elections be-
cause they have failed to pay a
$25 ﬁne owed to SGA. The ﬁne
was levied because the party
failed to submit a statement of
ﬁnances after last spring’s elec-
tions.

Kent Jarrell, president of SGA
and a member of the Pitt Action

I will not be taking an active
part in campaigning, I cannot en-

  Officials Struggling

 

%Against Assessors

Pitt is ﬁghting for the restoration of tax exemptions on
its Wildwood club and the chancellor’s home. To allay the
county assessor’s skepticism overactivities at the club, Uni-
versity ofﬁcialstold them at last week’s appeal meetingthat
golf has a place in higher education, adding that the Wild-

Wood “suburban campus” has an educational as well as rec-

reational value to Pitt.
Last July, the assessors. became
so skeptical that they put’ the

"tax-exempt Pitt golf club and

Chancellor Edward H. Litchﬁeld’s
Beechwood Blvd. residence on the
tax rolls. ' I

School officials. pointed out that
the Pitt-owned Wildwood prop-
erty, which has an assessed

_ value of $116,430, is essential to

the un‘iversi»fy’s‘ physical educa-

tion program. Many physical edu-

cation majors are required to take
golf, as part of their curriculum,
they said.
- Golf Education

Some students take it as an
elective. Regardless of whether
golfing is taken as an elective
subject, students who use ‘the
country club get an added bonus
in that they/are learning the so-
cial ‘graces, according to the Pitt

representatives. .

I . That’s why golf is broadening,
they added. Concerning the
Chancellor’s‘ Squirrel Hill ‘ man-

,-sion, they pointed_out that it’s
moreithanf just a "residence for

_.I’itt’s i ‘chief executive. The
manor, a one-acre estate located
in the Mellon Park district, is
where theuniversity does much
of its official entertaining. ‘

The assessors were told that

Chancellor'Litchﬁeld must play:

community groups, and national

' and international. figuresgat his.

Beechwood Blvd. home. The
estate, which has ,an assessed
value of $45,000 is owned by Pitt,
not ‘the’ chancellor.

4? It is staffed and maintained by

the university.
Change of Heart

By the time the hearing was
over, the assessors. appeared to
be.convinced that the residence
should ‘be granted tax exempt
status again. They called for more
information, however, on the
.Wildwood property.

The County ‘wants to know
how. many “outsiders,” persons
other than Pitt students or Pitt
alumni, hold membership cards
which entitle them to .use the

, 1'76-acre golf course.
One. representative estimated-
that there are about 60 outsiders,

110 faculty memberships, and 17
alumni memberships. County offi-
cials said that all Pitt students
are entitled to use the course.
But they have to pay green’s fee
to play.

“There have been some'_com—
plaints,” said Frank Ventura, vice
chairman of the County Board.of
Assessors, “about outsiders using
the course.” *

Representatives of the univers-

ity admitted “that the use is in 

a state of flux right at the mo-
ment.” “But we can assure you
that Wildwood is primarily in-
tended to serve students,” a Pitt
official said. ‘
“We’ll eliminate the outside
memberships if 'that’s necessary
to ‘preserve our tax exempt
status.” —

. P art-Time Jo—l;ls

Few This Term,
Says Mrs. Poole

Not enough part-time jobs are
available for those students ap-
plying this ‘trimester, according

to Mrs. Alice Poole, Supervisor

of Student Employment. The cur-
rent steel strike can be blamed for
the marked decline in employers’
demand for workers. ~~
Since thejob picture is so nar-
row ,Mrs. Poole must be mainly
concerned with the students who

_have the greatest need to work.

She advises students to make ap-
pointments to talk to her person-
allyi if there is a ﬁnancial pro-
blem. ' .

Even in normal times, there are
more applications than job "list-
ings. A student who truly has a
financial problem cannot be too
particular about the location,
hours, or salary of an obtainable
job. Typing skill is very helpful
to girls who wish to work. The
job picture may improve after
the strike.

who have proved they can do the job, depart from student
pjlitical life after a short while. ' -

A  In the second category are the students who run for po-
litical office only because they want to prove their popularity
,'and because they wish tovadd another title beside their
names. - '

‘days. Unfortunately again, there are far too- many ofthis

with the attitude, “If I win, it won’t take any time. They
never do anything anyway.” " I

However it is this type of attitude which helps to de-
stroy. effective student government. Take as an example
‘those 24 persons who were elected tothe Libera1.Arts and

ginet, there were a few oﬂicerswho did some work during
the past year. Perhaps--one .’or two of them actually dis-
played an interest inthe duties which such a cabinet can
perform. ‘ D

But then. there was the Liberal Arts Cabinet. This group
was non-functioning to the point where a suggestion has
been made to eliminate the body altogether. Going on their
do—nothing record in 1958-59, this appears to be a valid pro-

posal. ’
A A These class cabinets, which for the ﬁrst time have
‘brought together the men and women in one ruling body
for schools and classes, were devised to perform deﬁnite
functions, particularly in the realm of academics.

They have failed.

Just how many students have intentions of running for
posts in these cabinets in the Oct. 7 elections is not known
at this time. However, before deciding deﬁnitely to run, a
person must realize there is more to the office than cam-
paigning and holding the title.. There is work to be done.

It can be accomplished on-ly by students who are capable
and who are willing to serve their fellow students as they
are exepected to. d-o. «

 The Communist ‘Capitalist . ..-.’

By Murray Chass

What can we expect tomorrow when Nikita
Khrushchev, who is billed as Chairman of_ the
Council of Ministers of the Union of Soviet Social-
ist Republics, comes to __Pitt for lunch?

That seems to be the big question in everyone’s
mind at this point. Of course,
most persons probably are hop-
ing the Soviet boss will say and

do some exciting things. It
makes for a better show that
way.

However, incidents during the
ﬁrst half of his tour of the
United States more or less give
an idea what his behavior may
be here. Numerous times, the
Communist boss has lived up to -
the title of ‘the “unpredictable

In Los Angeles the world’s No. 1 Communist
complained because he was not permitted to visit
Disneyland. Police denied him this excursion be-
cause, they claimed, the security riskswere too-
great. But there was Mr. Khrushchev acting per-
haps as a child would when his mother told him
he couldn’t go to Walt Disney’s favorite site. Per-
haps we could take Mr. Khrushchev to Highland
Park Zoo tomorrow instead. . ‘ "

— A Russian's Inhibition

On the same day Khrushchev saw and disliked
a can—can type of dance at a Hollywood movie
studio. But.we must not forgetthat the little
woman, Mrs. Nina K., accompanied him to the
studio. ,
Perhaps the reaction would have been different
had he beenjwith a strictly male group. After all,
«a vodka-drinking man such as Mr. K. who can
offer a toast at the, pop of a cork should enjoy
other such forms of entertainment. .
Mr. Khrushchev likes it best when he -can talk
to the American people, the ordinary'man. He dis-
played that last Sunday as he stepped off his spe-
cial train at various small towns in California en

Things To ‘Beef About . ..

BonesOfConteniion   

‘By David Breaksiane

' On the "eve of the much-heralded visit of the
Russian “expeditionary force” it_may be-useful to

reviewthe basic reasons for the grand tour and‘

brieﬂy to outline the most pressing international

issues which presumably will ‘be discussed this‘

weekend at resident Eisenhower’s Camp David
retreat. ' .~ v
Chairman Nikita Khrushchev’s long-time am-
bition since gaining control of
-the Soviet Union "has been to
visit the fabled land of America.
As long as John Foster Dulles
was the Secretary .of State, it
was obvious to all parties con-
cerned that the Russian leader »

would never .set foot in the '
country.
The months following the

death of Mr. Dulles have seen
the gradual reshaping of State 3:
Department policy along more
ﬂexible lines in order to take advantage of sudden
shifts of viewpoint by foreign’ governments. When
Mr. Khrushchev suggested the exchange of visits
between the heads of the United States and Soviet
governments, it must have come as a pleasant sur-
prise to ﬁnd the “new” U. S. attitude so favorable.

There were perhaps three principal reasons for
the whirlwind sightseeingitrip which is just wind-
ing up amid reams of newsprint. It had been a
long-time desire of Mr. Khrushchev, an astute
leader and calculatingopponent, to see for himself
the country and the people which he has ﬁrmly

resolved 3 to overcome through one means or’

another.' .
Temporary Air Cleaning
' Secondly there was general agreement in the
world capitalsthat the exchange of visits would
serve to reduce East-‘West tensions, if only tempo-
rarily. »
This third objective, the discussion of world
problems by Mr. Eisenhower and Chairman
Khrushchev, is the most signiﬁcant, and should be
the determining factor in deciding whether the ex-
cursion into.capitalist. territory has had value for
the world at large.

Out of the many bases of American-S0viet~
friction, six can be reﬁned _which are the most ‘

significant in terms of world peace. _

This sort of thing was better than the “house

placed. . _ 
But perhaps Mr. Khrushchev would rather asso- 
ciate with the “masses” because they offer him 

less anxiety. They’_re not interested in throwing 
any antagonistic queriesat the Russian premier. I 
While on the "subject of these nasty questions,
Mr. K. believes that the best defense is a good of» V
fense. This philosophy is just the opposite of what A 
some of our top baseball and football and basket-'-A“ '  "

When he is asked about Hungary in 1956, he
quickly grabs the ball and moves to the oﬁ.'ense.-

the ball as he reminds Americans of various actions '
of ours which he terms distasteful. ' '

His likes, such as his preference for expensive
clothes, set him apart from the type of man Com- .
munists believe make a good party follower. Surely _
the Red leaders would not permit such high living
for anyone in any other position. _

Mr. Khrushchev would make an unusually good

To a layman, the univer-

V lole _a zoo.

, But among cages full of
monkeys, chickens, -rabbits
and mice, Dr. Jonas Salk, de-
veloper of the polio vaccine bear-
ing his name, spends much of his
life. '

It is in the midst of this laby-
rinth of. smells. and noises that
Dr. Salk and his staff of. some

\ 34 researchers continuously study
cells and viruses. ’ .

The Virus Research Laboratory
is Dr. Salk’s own creation. The
relationship between‘ continuous
cells and non-continuous cells is
the current study. Salk and his
aides also are seeking what is

-common in cancerous cells, which

belong in the category’ of con-
tinuous cells.
Have No Clock .

“We have no clock,” one of
Dr. Salk’_s staff said. “Our work
ends when we think we can leave.

. .“As for Dr.‘Salk,_ if there
were 40 hours in a day,’ he
6 would work". 40 hours. He usu-

.blem- that he couldn’t see Dr.
Salk about.”

Avoids Publicity
Dr. Salk, however, shuns pub-
licity. He declines many public
appearances because he feels he
has too much to be done to take

 time out.

\Vhen he has something he
feels is needed for medical as-
s'ociat(' he writes it for publi-
cation in medical journals. More
.than 60 of his papers have been
printed. The latest articles ap-
peared in the April 18 issue of
the “Journal of the American
Medical Association” and the
April “Annals of Internal Medi-
cine.”

Salk was relatively unknown
before he developed the polio
vaccine in his lab here. He was
born in New York City in 1914,
attended City College of New
York for his undergraduate work

and received his M.D. from New.

York University in 1934.

‘Worked on Flu

Between then and 1947 when
he arrived here Dr. Salk‘ did
much research, concentrating‘ at
times ‘on the’ influenza virus. He
helped develop a commercial flu
vaccine while working under a
fellowship at the University of
Michigan.

Twenty -years ago he married
Donna Lindsay, also a native
New Yorker. Dr. Salk declines
to discuss his personal life. He -
-and'his wife have three chil-
V dren, all boys-—"Peter, -15; Dar‘-
rell, 12; and Jonathan,'9.

Salk’s three children were
among the ﬁrst to receive the
Salk’ vaccine. That’s how ‘conﬁ-
dent the virus'resea1‘cher was in
his work. I .

Gets Awards

Since his work with.polio cata-
pulted him into the spotlight in
many walks of life ‘other than
science, Dr. Salk has received
numerous honors.

From Congress came a gold
medal. There was a citation from
President Eisenhower.

He entered the Polio Hall of
Fame in 1957 and the year be-
fore he was named one of the
American Medicine Men of the
Year. In 1958 he was recipient
of _a Great Living American
awardfrom the U. S. Chamber
of.Commerce. He was voted
Pittsburg'h’s Man of the Year in
1955.

His latest honor came just this
year when he was admitted as an
honorary fellow into the Royal
Society of Health in England.

Right now the Virus Research
Lab is expanding. After Pitt
bought the old Municipal Hospital

 Panthers. 
 To Lose Friday,
  But It May Help

By LARRY I-IAGGERTY

   

 

I
IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII

Unless they do a complete about face, the Panthers
will ﬁnd themselves coming out on the short end of the
score on Friday night when they encounter Southern Cal-
ifornia in Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum.

While'the Jungle Catswere stumbling all over the

‘gridiron-in squeezing by Marquette .21-15, the Trojans were
having very little difficulty in downing Oregon State 27-6.

' Thus from the results. of the two teams’ initial en-
counters, the Trojans of Coach Don Clark will rule as a solid

‘favorite. This, however, should be a .good omen for the

Panthers who u'sually come up with a superior performance
when they are touted as underdogs.
If you disagree with the previous assumption, just
-consult last season’s results. The Jungle Cats were a
"14-point underdog when they held the nation’s top

’-‘rated team, Army, .to a 14-14 tie. _

I As former Notre Dame coach Frank Leahy stated after
the game, “This will prevent Red Blaik from being named
‘Coach of the Year’ for the second time in his career, an
honor attributed to no. other collegiate tutor." Leahy was
right because the honor went to Paul Dietzel of LSU.

The Panthers were also ﬁgured as probable losers
against UCLA and Notre Dame, but captured both con-
itests. However, when the Jungle Cats were listed as a
twenty point choice to trim Nebraska, they were defeated
in 1958’s “upset of the year.” Needless to say the Pan-
thers were two touchdown favorites against Marquette.

Coach John Michelosen’s.most pressing problem_ at
the moment is the quarterback situation. If therewere
one or two more Ivan‘ Toncics on the roster, Michel-
osen’s problem would be solved, but there just aren’t.

. It appears as though Toncic will have to play-at least
40 to 50 minutes if the Blue and Gold hope to beat USC,
but Toncic has a trick knee and will probably need as much
relief as Michelosen can afford to give his ace signal caller.

This relief ﬁgures to come from Sophomore Dave
Kraus, the numberjtwo quarterback at the moment, who
played extremely well on defense in the opening game but
failed to move the team with any degree of consistency.
Kraus runs well with the ball but is no Sammy Baugh when
it comes to heaving the pigskin. '

The other signal calling reserves are Sophomore

John Sakal and Senior Pete’ Prince. Sakal, who along

with Kraus was red-shirted last year, is an exceptional

passer and'will no doubt see action onFriday night if
the Panthers need a long pass or two to hit paydirt
while Toncic is being rested.

Prince was the Panthers’ forgotten man until the ﬁnal
game with Penn State last year. As luck would haveit the
Jungle Cats’ top three quarterbacks, Toncic, Bill Kaliden
and Ed Sharockman, received serious injuries and Prince

was pressed into service and did as well as could be ex- '

pected under the conditions.

Against Marquette he was used on defense and will
be used in the same capacity throughout the campaign.
Prince is no stranger to USC followers since he made his
local debut against the Trojans on the Coast two years ago
as a right halfback.

By coincidence the three right halfbacks received in-
juries so Michelosen inserted Prince in the unfamiliar po-
sition and the boy from New Hampshire picked up some

n crucial yardage to enable the Panthers to gain a 20-14
triumph. V

If either Kraus, Sakal or Prince can provide capable

relief for Toncic, the Panthers ﬁgure to have a successful

season. But if they don’t, it will be a long season.

Blue iliid’ Gold
To Go Against
West Coasters

By TED COLTON

Friday night in Memorial Coli-
seum at Los Angeles the Panth-
ers will face the University of
Southern California in what may
turn out to be their toughest
game of the year. Kick-off time
is slated for 8 p.m. P.C.T. or 11
p.m. EST.

In the past several years, an
outstanding trademark of John
Michelosen’s Panthers’ was that
his teams featured very few sop-
homores. But things have chang-
ed this year as a total of 11 un-
der-classmen saw action in last
Saturday’s opener at Milwaukee.

If the opener is any indication,
this change may make what many
“experts” picked to be a losing
season for the Panthers, a win-
ning one. ~

Ray Tarasi, Larry Vignali,
Andy Kuzneski. and John Yaccino
all turned in excellent showing
against a big Marquette team.
Tarasi, a halfback, sparkled on
defense, while Vignali and Kuz-
neski did a good job patching up
the middle of the Panthers line
which was supposed to be one of
their glaring weak spots.

Yaccino made a couple. of ﬁne

with the Panthers Friday night,
the Trojans wil have to provide
more than words to subdue Pitt’s

USC head coach, Don Clark,

about‘ his 1959 squad. Some of

night, the main topic of conversation is the surging Los
Angeles’ Dodger baseball team. But on the Southern Cali- -
fornia campus there is no time for baseball talk because all
the attention is centered on the Trojan football team, who
will be making a bid this year to return as a national foot-

returning as one of the out- i

standing. backs on the coast,

while Coia has been relegated V

to the bench because of a trou-
blesome knee. _
This speedster was shackled by
innumerable ‘injuries and ‘ never
had the opportunity to live up

to his advance billing. Coia would i

be the fastest on the ﬁeld with
his best time in the hundred be_-

ing a resounding 9.5. —.

If USC,can avoid the crippling

injuries, thatlthey sustained last .
"year, this 1959 season, could see.

them emerge A among mythical ‘top-
ten grid powers.

‘tense. The Panthers have always
been strong on defense but will
have to come .up with a scorer if
they expect to improve on last
year’s‘ 3-7 record.

The greatest scoring threat thus
far seems to be Simon Pestich.
Pestichihas the speed necessary
for avscoring lineman. Bob Mur-
-doch,- however, also has the po-

tential of a high scorer. “The en—_

tire line will have to ‘get. the
scoring desire if we are to im-

‘prove on offense,” Bemis said.

 o¢3§o

 

Wyatt, Podmilsak- Co-Captains

Leading the team on defense are
fullbacks Ron-Podmilsak and Ron
'Wyatt. Last week both men were
-elected, co-captains of the Soccer
team. Wyatt was an all-American
last year but is lagging on de-
fense and will have‘ to improve
to come ‘up to last year’s rating.

Center fullback Kal Smith is
one ofthe most improved players

l and has been moved up to ﬁrst

string. ‘Smith is expected to give
the 'booters in 0 r e defensive
strength. ' . '

According to ‘Bemis the play-'
er. that can do more with a soc-
cer ball than anyone else is John
Andrade. “He has the best
touch,” said Bemis, “But he
lacks team spirit.” Andrade has
reported a bad ‘leg since the’
ﬁrst week of practice.

Injuries to the booters have all
‘been minor.‘Among those on the
injured list are: Ron Prado, Ron
Mehoch, Ed Weihrauch and
George Akikos.

..lVs to Play Saturday
Saturday morning the junior
varsity will play its ﬁrst game of

-'the’season when they encounter
Frostberg State Teachers College

at Elsworth Field. .
The biggest problem of t h e

JVs is a lack of experience. When

_s c o r i n g opportunities present

‘themselves the line is unable to

capitalize on them. The defense
also shows definite weaknesses in
not bieng able to recover quickly.

( Continued from Page ‘6)

A surprise’ starter for the Jun-
glo Cats in the opener. was
Kraus. An injury to quarter-
back Ivan Toncic forced Miche-
losen to use‘Kra.us on defense,

— and from his initial showing he
will undoubtedly see a lot of
‘action the remainder» of the.

years - ’
The biggest surprise to the
Panther followers was * Fritz

Walker. The big Mt." Lebanon end
was making tackles all over the
ﬁeld. Walker and Ditka should
give the USC quarterback a rough
time Saturday. '

' The injuries which have plag-
ued the Blue and Gold in the
opener are slowly disappearing
and Michelosen is hoping that his
boys wil be at full strength for
USC. Chuck Reinhold and Toncic
both have good chances of seeing
.a lot of action Friday with their
injuries almost recovered.

The -Panthers will leavefor Los
Angeles Thursday morning at 8:15
am. from,’ the ‘airport and ‘will
be the ﬁrst football team in the
country to travel by jet air plane.

should make the big difference in
this year’s squad. Limited to four
games last year‘ because of a

.broken shoulder blade, Wood still

age to rank third amorig Trojan

If last week’s openers are to be
interpreted as indicators of the
respective strength of these two
teams, it-would be best if-their
Ca1ifornia—bound jet [airline never
got off the ground. On the other
hand, if the erratic Panthers can
come up with one of their big
games in their California invas-
ion, it could change the whole

complexion of Pitt’s 1959 cam-
paign.

eighth small college team in the
country. .

The Rockets opened their sea-
son last week-end by routing the
Jeanette Harriers 15-55, taking
the first‘ seven places in. the

' meet.

Coach Rees says, “Slippery
Rock has been preparing all sum-
mer for-our meet. Naturally it
wil be a big feather. in the Rock-
ets’ cap if they can upset Pitt.
However, I am conﬁdent that our
boys will return with‘ a victory.”

Starting for the. Cats will be
Ron Rush, who won at Slippery
Rock last year, Mickey Jupina,
Reed Clarke, Bill Hinchberger
and Bob Stuck. The sixth and
seventh positions are yet to be
named. Rees has narrowed his
selections to Don Adams, Jim

SPORTS REPORTERS

Anyone interested in writing
sports for the Pitt News should
see Bill Neff or Jack Smith in
409 Schenley Hall. Positions are
still open.

In that game the Dirty Birds
were penalized 237 yards be-
cause of personal fouls, the re-
sult being a 21-6 loss to Grin-
nell. All three touchdowns
.were the ‘direct result of the
‘penalties.

But the Knox Knickers are not -

withoutblemish on their record.
Last year’s traditional Knox-Coe
game was delayed two hours and
11 minutes when.the Knox vars-
ity manager, Hodden Cadﬁeld,
realized that in the excitement of
winning a narrow _‘victory over
Larwance the week previous he
had forgotten to bring back home
the team’s only football.

Naturally it was Cadﬁeld’s fe-

tsponsibility to ﬁnd another ball,

and he did -so by stealing the
ball from a midget league which
was playing 23 blocks, away.,
