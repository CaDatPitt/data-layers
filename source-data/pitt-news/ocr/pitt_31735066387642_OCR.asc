Board

members
charge
Moyer

By Frances Sansig
Managing Editor

Charges have been filed
through thejudicial Board against
Student Government Board presi-
dent Phil Moyer by board mem-
bers Therese McFadden and
Melanie Naro, alleging that he
approved funds for the Engineer-
ing Student Cabinet to attend a
leadership conference without
the necessary approval of the
Board. ‘

’’It never went to the Board for I

approval, and Phil signed the
papers,” according to Naro.
Naro said they requested
Moyer receive a letter of repri-
mand from the office of Student
Activities and Vice President of
Student Affairs Conney Kimbo
stating that all business that
wasn't approved by the Board go

‘to the Board for approval, and

that a letter of apologybe sent_to
the members of the SGB.
In response to the charges,

Moyer said, ’’.In all my activities"
on the Board, I've maintained‘

one thing: I'm definitely con-
cerned with student organiza-
tions. All of my activities were
only meant to further Student
Government.“

The charges will be brought up
at this Tuesday's 5 p.m. meeting.

An SCB meeting called to
select the committee to choose
the Allocations Board was abrupt-
ly adjourned after McFadden and
Naro walked out because they
did not want to vote on the issue
in the absence of Board members
Rosemary Cardone, Vince Alto-
mare and ‘Pamela Rich.

The Pitt athletic department is
taking measures to stop the
throwing of streamers and other
objects by fans sitting in the stu-
dent section at Pitt basketball
games at Fitzgerald Field House.

Pitt Sports Information Director
Larry Eldridge said fans will be

bition game against the Canadi-

”We want to halt the throwing
of objects on the court. There is
the threat of danger [to the play-
ers] with people throwing toilet
paper and coins, and we're not
going to condone this,” said El-
dridge. _

Eldridge said the cards may be
handed out at the first few regu-
lar season games, but he's hop-
ing fans at tonight's game, which
is a near sell-out,'abi,de by the

- policy immediately. _

Since Pitt's entry into the Big
East Conference in 1982, Pitt fans
started throwing streamers on the
floor after the Panthers scored
their first points of the game.

The tradition — which many
believe started at the Palestra in
Philadelphia years ago — has
continued at Pitt games every

. year since 1982.

However, some fans have
taken advantage of the fun the
last few years, as many have
thrown full rolls of toilet paper on

   

the floor.

Three years ago, Pitt's Charles
Smith twisted a knee in a game
against Boston College after step-
ping on a coin someone threw an
the floor during the game.

Eldridge made it that clear any-
one caught throwing objects on
the floor will be escorted from the
Field House.

”What we’r_e,doing has ema-
nated from the Big East office.
They want to stop the throwing
ofobjects atall the home courts,

 

and we're following what they
want us to do,’-’ said Eldridge.
Pitt doesn't plan to increase

security at the games to supervise .

the fans, according to Eldridge.
”We’re depending on the fans

to put an end to this,” he said.
Pitt basketball coach Paul

Evans was not involved in the de- V

cision to ban the throwing of ob- '

jects on the playing floor, but last

_ year, he said the "activity had be-

come dull.

Snowstorm causes Continental Airlines crash

DENVER — A Continental
Airlines jet with 81 people
aboard flipped on its back while
taking off from Denver's airport
in a snowstorm Sunday and skid-
ded-along the runway, killing at
least 19 people and injuring 54
more, authorities said.

”We counted 18 dead outside
the plane, and there are several
dead in the fuselage," said Staple-
ton International Airport spokes-
man Richard Boulware.
Twenty-one people walked away
from the crash, officials said.

The DC-9 twin—engine jet,
Flight I 713, was Carrying 76 pas-
sengers and five crew members
from Denver to Boise, Idaho, said
Continental spokesman Ned
Walker. Walker said the flight
originated in Oklahoma City, and
the crash took place shortly after
2 p.m. MST.

Rescue work was hampered by
falling snow and ice, visibility
was poor and some survivors
were still trapped inside the plane
more than four hours after the ac-
cident, authorities said.

”Many people are survivors at
this point,” Walker said. ”It’s too
early to speculate on anything
that could have occurred (to
make the plane crash).”

‘Stark captain claims

WASHINGTON — Deficient
radarequipment aboard the USS
Stark, and not the ship's crew,
was chiefly responsible for the
frigate’s failure to defend itself
against an Iraqi missile attack last
May, the ship's Captain said in his
first extensive comment on the in-
cident. I

Capt. Glenn R. Brindel ac-
knowledged ”deficiencies in the
watch” aboard the ship, but
wrote, ”Their actions or inactions

.. are not primary causes for
Stark’s failure to defend against
the  attack.

”Unfortunately, the ship's ra-
dars and electronics did not func-
tion as advertised.”

After a recent racial attack on
a black family in this
predominantly white neighbor-

‘ hood, residents are rallying to

stand up to the gang of white
teenagers, mostly boys, that has
billed itself in spray paint as the
”Frankford Kill Squad.”

The group had disrupted the
neighborhood with vandalism,

obnoxious behavior and pro-

fanity.

But on Nov. 6, nuisance turned
to violence, much to the horror
of Maryellen and Bill Snow and
their four children, who lived
peacefully in the neighborhood
for three years. _

After walking home from work
with a white co—worker, Bill
Snow answered a knock at his

Snow, 29, was struck in the leg
with a board and knocked to the
ground, according to Snow and
neighbors who witnessed the at-
tack. The gang surrounded him,
yelled racial slurs and poked him
with the boards.

Dr. Alvin Poussaint, production consultant for The Cosby

Show lectured to Pitt students.

Noted author advises students on relationships

By Marc Duchin

News Editor

Last week, Pitt students
gathered in the David Lawrence
Auditorium to discuss their inti-
mate relationships with Dick Pur-
nell, renowned speaker, author
and counselor.

Purnell’s visit marked the third
consecutive year he has traveled
to Pitt, sponsored by the Campus
Crusade for Christ.

g Purnell’s lectures were divided
into a three-part series on Nov.

10, 11 and 12 titled, ”How to
Know Your Love,” ”Why Cou-
ples Break Up” and ”Sex and the
Search_ for |ntimacy.”

”lnside [people], there is an in-

satiable desire to know someone.

intimately on all levels,” said Pur-
nell. ”I tell people to have a lot
of fun [with dating], but dating is
a serious thing, which leads to a
serious marriage.”

. Purnell said today's students
are now more aware -‘of the
divorce rate and are asking more
”in-depth” questions dealing
with their relationships.

 

By Jodi Lappen

For The Pitt ‘News

Dr. Alvin Poussaint, dean of
student activities at Harvard med-
ical school and best-selling
author and production consultant
to The Cosby Show, spoke to Pitt‘
students last Thursday night on
the subject of racism.

The event was sponsored by
the Black Action Society as part
of the 18th annual Black Week.

”Presently, there is a greater
desire [of students] to have suc-

cessful relationships,” he said. ._

Purnell has toured the country
for the past 10 years lecturing to
students and single adults. He
graduated from Wheaton College
in 1962 and earned a master's of
divinity from Trinity Evangelical
Divinity School and a master's
degree in education, specializing
in counseling from Indiana

University.

Purnell said he never tires of
answering questions.
”Every situation is new. Every

Cosby Show consultant speaks at Pitt on racism

Poussaint, an assistant profes-
sor of psychology, wrote two in-
troductions to Bill Cosby’s novels.

Poussaint’s lecture began with
the roots of racism._He spoke of
stereotypes dating back to the na-
tive Americans and how society
has learned to accept these
stereotypes;

Poussaint traced the existence
of racism and explained how it
evolved and how it is still active
in today's society. He claims that

person is different,” he said. ’’I try
to respect the individuality of
people.”

Purnell stressed that physical,
social, emotional, mental and
spiritual factors, diagrammed as
a five-pointed star, should be con-
sidered in every healthy, intimate
relationship. ’

’-’When there is an equilibrium
in those five areas, a relationship
has balance and harmony,” he
said. ’’If a couple concentrates on
techniques of sex without con-
sidering other points of the star,
it can cause confusion.

—.v -v-.3.

society ”legitimizes” racism,
which promotes the continuation
of the oppression of blacks.
”The lecture provided me with
new insights into human perspec-
tives on native Americans and the

different types of racism a black

male and a black female must
deal with,” said Matthew La-
mons, a Pitt student. ~

Poussaint suggested an active
rather than passive attitude tor-
ward racism.

”Ninety—five percent of peo-
ple's responses have [been
favorable to] what I said,” he ad-
ded. ’’I try to present advice

based on what are God's princi— ‘

ples that have proven true for
millennia.”

”We were real happy with the '-

response we got,” said William

Pugh, spokesman for Pitt's Cam—- ’
pus Crusade for Christ and.coor— .-

dinator of the lecture series. "A
lot of people said this wasreal

good stuff, and it would help with 

their relationships.”

everybody there,” said Naro,
who said she believed Board
members weren't given sufficient
notice of the meeting.

The issue involved whether or
not there should be three, four or
five people on the committee to
select the Allocations Board.

Moyer called for a five—member I

committee, but McFadden mo-

tioned that the selection commit-_

tee should consist of only three
members — Moyer, Karen Bo-
hichek, Allocations Committee
chairperson, and 5GB president-
elect Craig Jackson.

Board member Fiora Boehm

said two additional members

should be on the committee. ’’I
don't think it's fair to have three
people judging them,” said
Boehm.

McFadden then suggested a
possible fourth member and stat-
ed that there was no precedent
for five members.

Jackson said he felt the selec-
tions ”should be decided upon
by the three of us [including Moy-
er and Bohichek].”

Moyer argued that there was a
precedent for having a fifth mem-
ber, in which case he suggested
president pro-tempore. Fio_ra

Boehm, and ”Precedents do‘,

mean something.”

After deliberation, it was decid-l
* ed that four members would .

serve on the selection committee
—- Moyer, Jackson, Bohichek and

Ron Miletta, chairperson of the ‘

Judicial Board.

Once again please
with decorum

Recently, the Student Government Board seems to have gone

~ through what can best be describedas a change of operating

procedure. Amid a controversy over the number of people to
be appointed to the allocations board, bickering among the
members of the board has ended productive discussion on the
matter.

During Friday's meeting, two members of the SGB, Melanie
Naro and Therese McFadden, walked out — apparently to pre-
vent a vote on the makeup of the allocations selection com-
mittee. Phil Moyer, SGB president, has been accused of acting
without board approval when such approval is required.

Moyer has denied that his actions were personally motivat-'
ed and has said that his activities were ”only meant to further
student government.” ‘ ‘

Naro and McFadden have filed charges with the Judicial
Board that Moyer approved funds for a student group without
receiving Board approval.

Until now, the SGB has worked well together, making real
progress in the resolution of problems for students. While it
is still too early to tell whether Moyer acted improperly, it is
painfully clear that nothing will be solved by members walk-
ing out of meetings.

We hope that the SGB will be able to sort out its problems,
and if there have been questionable activities on the part of
various Board members, that the appropriate action will be
taken. Appropriate action in a governing body, student or other-
wise, never consists of public name-calling or using govern-
ment meetings as a forum for personal statements.

It would certainly be comforting to think our elected SGB
members are keeping that small point in mind.

In a nutshell  P

The [Sandinistas] special-
ize in self-contradictory non-
sense. My favorite came from
the official who said the op-
position paper ”accused us
of suppressing freedom of ex-
pression. This was a lie, and
we could not let them pub-
lish it.”

Take a walk on the wayside

The wayside is a cut—off point
— the land at the edge of a road,
to be exact.

To trip the light fanatic — that
is what dancing by the wayside
is. Perilously close to insanity, we
falter on what is perceived to be
the path to self—definition.

Thousands of people defined
themselves as Pitt fans Saturday
night. I did. You probably did,
too. There is something that casts
a spell on a person — not magi-
cal, but more like demonical -

-when a contest, especially one of

this magnitude, is involved.
With a single swoop of cocky
determination, I donned my Pitt
sweatshirt, my Pitt ticket and my
Pitt attitude and headed for the
game.
Aside from a very real fear that

-I might be suffering from

hypothermia at the beginning of
the third quarter, I found myself
watching the clock more than the
field, hoping for long, time-
consuming plays. And heavens to
Heyward, they happened. (For-

What I had witnessed touched

of my friends and his roommate
had been beaten up by a dozen
male youths the night before on
Forbes Avenue in South Oakland.
They both escaped with modest

,g injury and weren't mugged. They

were just physically attacked for
no reason at all.

I have known several people
that have been beaten for no rea-
son. There was no provocation,
just people on their way home.

The area beginning from ”The
O” down to, I'd say, where Capri
Pizza is are the toughest places to
passthrough on the weekend
nights. There are many cops near
”The O”, but when there are
hundreds of congregating youths
further on in South Oakland,
wouldn't it make sense to spread
police protection out a little
more? “

But another thing I can't be-
lieve is that so many people
would have nothing better to do

than line the streets of Oakland
and harass other ‘people — and
that is what most of them do.

A big football game is only one
time for such incidents to occur.
There is something strange about
human nature that causes people
to want to fight. A healthy way to
release this tension is vicarious-
ly, through an activity such as a
football game.

It is when this tension is
released through violent, physical
means that fans truly become fa-
natical. You want to fight, to get
it all out, so you do.

I could just feel the tension
saturating the streets early the af-
ternoon of the game. I think
everyone could. It would be team
against team, man against man,
school against school.

Everyone has the innate drive
to be a winner. The borderline
between‘ that which will make
one fight and that which will
make one not fight becomes ap-
parently thinner when the drive
to win is greater. Maybe these
youths pointlessly injure others
because of their desire to be
winners.

What is it that separates those
who go over the edge from those
who maintain control of them-
selves? The only game they know
is physical, and it's the only one
they know how to win.

Thank goodness there are more
than just physical games. Could
you imagine if all those physical-
ly less capable lost — what would
be left on this Earth?

Minority
Jobs Fair

has large  

turnout

By Marc Duchin

News Editor

Representatives from 70 com-
panies talked with interested stu-
dents last Thursday at the annual
Minority Jobs Fair held at the Wil-
liam Pitt Union Assembly Room
in celebration of Black Week.

The fair was co—sponsored by
the Black Action Society and the
National Society for Black En-
gineers. V

Roxanne Jones, BAS committee

member for Black Week, said

that she was pleased with the par-
ticipation of companies and
students.

”It [the jobs fair] was the best
one so far,” she said. ”This year,
people came [to the fair] in suits
with their resumes. Many seniors
arranged interviews with com-
panies.”

”I think it is a good idea,” said 1

Eric Spaloman, a Pitt senior.
”O_ftentimes during the course of
the year, it's hard for-the students
to get out and meet the com-
panies.”

Kathleen Valentine, BAS co-
coordinator of the event, stressed
the importance of minority job
fairs. ;

”This is the only real outlet that
students have to companies who
want to hire minorities,” she said.
”We told'everyone to come, in
fact because last year we didn't
have many people show up.

Valentine said that the most
popular companies among stu-
dents were IBM, AT&T, General
Motors and Xerox.

”Our objective was being able
to interview what we call quality
students,” said Kenneth Boston,
district sales planning manager
for Xerox. ”We wanted to find
out what students are interested
in and hopefully give them some
direction in how we might be
able to assist them in their career
decisions.”

”As far as jobs, I'm looking for
security,” said Katrina Wright, a
Pitt junior.

Evans said it was his hope that
the activity would be stopped this
season.

Eldridge said it is time Pitt fans
start a ”new tradition" to support
the team. ‘

He said a Pitt sorority, Chi-
Omega, has come up with‘ towels
for fans to wave, much like the

The proceeds from the sale of

Volleyball win streak stopped at.Penn State

By Don Boyd
Staff Writer

The Lady Panthers entered the
Penn State Invitational Volleyball
Tournament this weekend ranked
20th in the nation with an NCAA,
high 24—match winning streak.
High hopes were being enter-
tained of hosting an NCAA open-
ing round match.

Unfortunately, those hopes

were dashed as Pitt lost to Penn
State on Friday night (5-1 5, 15-8,
10-15, 1-15) and Syracuse on
Saturday afternoon (15—9, 15-8,
2-15, 2-15, 8-15) before rebound-
ing to defeat Cleveland State
(15-8, 15-4, 15-3) on Saturday

- evening.

Having already lost to Pitt twice
this season, the Lady Lions were
out for revenge, and they got it.

”Penn State, supported by as large

crowd, played as though their
backs were to the wall,” com-
mented Pitt coach Shelton Colli-
er as the Panthers were defeated
three games to one.

The Lady Panthers’ loss to Syra-
cuse was areal shocker. Pitt had
never lost a game to Syracuse pri-
or to Saturday's match, and the
tradition appeared to be holding
true as Pitt won the first two
games. However, Syracuse ral-

lied to take the final three games
and the match. Collier reflected
on the loss: ’’I might have made
an error in judgment, playing a
lot of players in the third game.
Syracuse started playing with a
lot of confidence, and it was too
difficult to come back.”

The two losses have left the
Lady Panthers’ season up in the
air. ”The loss to Penn State would
not be viewed by the NCAA

selection committee as a critical

loss, but the. loss to Syracuse

could prohibit us from qualifying
for the NCAA tournament. Our
hopes of participating in the tour-
nament have gone from definite
to questionable,” noted a disap-
pointed Collier. 4
Despite the rough weekend,
Collier has not lost confidence in
his team. ”A coach finds out how

If you were told, prior to the
Pitt-Penn State game Saturday
night, that Pitt's offense would
score three points and win,
you might not have found too
many believers.

Fact is, even Penn State
head coach Joe Paterno was a
little surprised at the score.

’’If you said it was going to
be a low-scoring game, it
wouldn't have surprised me,
but 3-O would,” said Paterno,
referringto the game before
senior strong safety Billy
Owens intercepted a Matt
Knizner pass with 20'seconds

n

remaining and returned it for
a 69-yard touchdown.

Owens’ interception, his
first on the season, sealed the
Panthers’ win and closed out
the scoring, 10-0, in front ofa
sold—out-Pitt Stadium crowd of
56,500.

”We played so well,” said
Pitt head coach Mike Gott-
fried. ”You have to give credit
to our defense to hold them
without a score. They played
great the whole game.”

Pitt's defense has now
registered three shutouts this
season, with two of those
coming in the past two games.
They have not allowed a point
in their last 10 quarters.‘ ‘

Pitt opened the scoring on
their first possession‘ of the
game. Pitt started the drive on
their own 46-yard line and the
Panthers were able to drive
down to the Penn State 27,
highlighted by a 10-yard pass,
by freshman Darnell‘ Dicker-
son to sophomore receiver
Reggie Williams. After the
drive stalled, Jeff VanHorne
kicked a 44-yard field goal (his
longest of the season) and
gave the Panthers‘ all the
points they would need.

After the VanHorne field
goal, the defenses took over.

THE PITT NEWS, Monday, November l6, I987

Pantherswin despite missed opportunities

Something strange, very
strange, happened at Pitt Stadium
‘Saturday night.

Despite Pitt's numerous errors
and missed opportunities, it still
was able to defeat cross-state rival
Penn State, 10-O, before a
delirous sell-out crowd of 56,500
at Pitt Stadium, thanks to Craig
”Ironhead” Heyward and the Pitt
defense.

However, the script seemed all
too familiar for self-destruction by
the Panthers.

With a 3-0 lead in the first
quarter, Pitt had the ball at the
Lions’ 33 after recovering a fum-
ble. On first down, Darnell Dick-
erson hit Reggie Williams for a
29-yard completion, giving Pitt
the ball at the four, with four
downs to push it in.

Here's where Pitt started to dis-
play its masochistic ways.

Three plays lost three yards,
and kicker Jeff VanHorne came in
for a chip-shot, 24-yard field goal.
But he missed wide left.

The Pitt defense, which played
superbly the whole game, helped
Penn State get out of bad field po-
sition with a 15-yard personal

foul penalty.

And, while the Nittany Lions
couldn't move the ball, their im-
proved field position forced Pitt
to start its last five possessions of
the half from its own 14-, 4-, 6-,
8- and 12-yard lines.

Not exactly the kind of field po-
sition you want to have, especial-
ly with a freshman quarterback
playing in only his second full
game as a starter.

But Dickerson's inexperience
showed as the Panthers couldn't
move the ball, and Heyward
went into the locker room at half-
time very disappointed.

”I was very, very upset because
I only carried the ball eight times.
Normally, I get about 18 carries
or more in a half. I thought my
average was going to go down,”
said Heyward.

”When Penn State wants to key
-on somebody, they are real good
at it. We just went to the passing
early to open things up. Penn
- tate’s defense had no choice but
to spread out with Darne|l’s abil-
ity,” added Heyward.

At halftime, Pitt coach Mike
Gottfried knew he had to change

ENRIGIIIT

his offensive thinking. ”We
talked about getting Craig [Hey-
ward] back in the game. We had
to get the ball in his hands,” he
said. ‘

In the second half, Pitt did just
that as Heyward carried 24 times
for 123 yards.

However, the Panthers could
not put any more points on the
board, as VanHorne continued
showcasing his Mark Brasco im-
personation, missing 28- and
26-yard field goals.

Penn State was missing field
goals, too, due to a strong Pitt
defensive surge.

The Panthers blocked two field
goal attempts by Ray Tarasi, the
most important one coming with
4:15 left in the game.

”Our kicking wasn't what we
would have liked,’’ Paterno said.

But Pitt continued to give Penn

State chances. Pitt was called for
pass interference, keeping Penn
State's final drive alive with a
minute left.

Finally, Billy Owens ended all
this misery called a football
game, as he intercepted a Matt
Knizner pass and returned it 69
yards for a touchdown.

So, despite all the mistakes (in-
cluding 1 1 penalties for 99 yards)

and squelched opportunities, Pitt
won its biggest football game
since  well, since the last time
the Panthers beat Penn State back
in 1984 at Happy Valley 31-11.

It was a big win for Pitt, and it
ensures the Panthers of post-
season action for the first time
since 1983.

What will make this game so
memorable is the fact the game
itself, unlike most others from the
past 10 years, was so sloppily
played. Knizner and Dickerson
combined were 19 for 59 for 248
yards, not to mention the five
missed field goals.

”This game was a credit to our
defense,” Gottfried said. ’’I

wasn't surprised we shut them
out because our strategy was to
put heat on their offense all night,

and it worked well. I hated to see
our kid [VanHorne] not take ad-
vantage of scoring opportunities,

but 19-year-old kids are going to
make mistakes.”

The teams also combined for
149 penalty yards, and don't for-
get Penn State missed a scoring
opportunity when a wide-open
Paul Promfret dropped a pass
from Knizner that would have
went for a touchdown in the se-
cond quarter.

It was a catch-22. Both offenses
were lousy, but remember, both
defenses were great.

Obviously, the game's level of
excitement depended on your
perspective. .’

”This was a great game. Every

play was a decision. This was a

classic football game,” ‘said
Gottfried.

Great, no. Classic, maybe.

But,.for Pitt, it was undoubted-
ly both.

The Pitt Panthers (7-3) have

net Bowl to be held December

Now that the Pitt football team

still got the job done against us,”
said Penn State coach Joe
Paterno.

0 Jeff VanHorne’s three missed
field goals from inside the 28-
yard line put a‘ lot of extra, even
unnecessary, pressure on the
Panther defense. So far in 1987,

tempts. The Pitt ”D” should be
praised all the more for their im-

pressive ‘shutout effort. '

Richard and Jon Carter for their
blocks of PSU kicker Ray Tarasi’s
attempts. Said Gottfried, ”They
were outstanding plays. We
worked hard on improving our

ence, that's fine.  But if we're
gonna take a licking, then I want
to be out there taking a licking
along with everybody else.”
The Steeler running game was
surely one thing that took a lick-
ing on this particular Sunday.
Averaging over 153 yards per
game on the ground coming into
the game, Pittsburgh was held to
86 by the stingy Oiler defense.

Running back Walter Abercrom- '

bie, who rushed for 30 yards on
the day, was discouraged by his
team's effort. .

-”They prepared well for us, but

we couldn't get anything going 

ourselves. It wasn't a lack of ef-

fort or preparation, but things just 
wouldn't get going. It was frus- ‘

trating.”

The Oilers’ Mike Rozier rushed» 5 3‘

for 99 yards on 27 carries. As a

team, Houston produced 139 

yards on the ground.

”They didn't do anything to
surprise us today," said Noll.
”That’s the sign of a pretty good
football team when you know

what they're gonna do, and they “H

still do it.”

”I think [people] forget that
we're dealing with 18- or
19-year-old kids who want to
win. Effort is what you look
for," said Gottfried.

”I was all psyched after that
first field goal. I thought to my-
self, ’I'm going to have an ex-
cellent game.’ That last one, I
could have sworn it was
good,” said VanHorne. ”The
guy who catches the ball [af-
ter the kick] said it was good.
I just don't know. That's why
I stayed on the field.”

After VanHorne's miss,
_Penn State drove 61 yards
down to the Pitt 19, which in-
cluded a 52-yard pass from
Knizner to Michael Timpson,
but Tarasi’s field goal attempt
of 36 yards was blocked by
Jon Carter.

”It's a hard feeling to ex-
plain,” said Carter. ”I was just
able to penetrate. Gary
Richard blocked the first kick

because he found a weak spot._

They adjusted the second
time, and I found the weak
spot."
With 4:15 remaining, Pitt
couldn't run out the clock, so
Penn State had one last chance
with 1:13 left on the clock.
I. Knizner, on third-down- and-
ten, threw a pass for Timpson,

which Pitt was called for pass-
ing interference and gave
Penn State a first down.

After another first down on
a 17-yard pass from Knizner to
Sean Barowski, Knizner
passed for Timpson was inter-
cepted and returned for a
touchdown. .

“Matt got careless —— he
threw without looking,'' said
Paterno. ’’It was a hurry-up
kind of thing. It was the first

‘ time they changed [defense]

on us. They made a good call
on us.” -

”The quarterback was trying
to throw an out. He was trying
to get some yards to get them
into field goal position,” said
Owens. '

”Once I caught the ball, I
knew it was clear sailing. I
didn't know if it would be a

‘score. I couldn't see the quar-

terback. I just knew we need-
ed an interception,” he added.

The win over Penn State
brightens Pitt's bowl hopes. As
for Gottfried, he doesn't care
which bowl, just as long as
they're going.

”I don't know what bowl
game we're going to, but I
know we are going. Which-
ever bowl game it is, we'll be
proud to play in that bowl.”
said Gottfried.
