To the Editor,

I’m alittle disappointedbythe Oct.

the 2010 Dining Guide. As anexplorer
of Pittsburglfs (especially Oal<land’s)
best dining options, I couldn’t wait to

see what the staff at TPN had to say.

about various restaurants. Unfortu-
nately, my expectations for nice re-
views, unknown restaurants and cheap
gems were let down and instead I was
given completely ambiguous reviews
(markedbya“price-per—poun ”advan—

tage), chain restaurants and two small 1

articles highlighting new-to-the-area

toaplace like Szechuan Expressbecause
they give the customer more food per
pound does nothingto comment on the
food quality or atmosphere.

A Instead offocusing on restaurants
that every freshman knows by heart,
I would have liked to see articles and
reviews oftl1e1esser-visited andtastier
options for cheap college kids in Oak-
land —— Spice Island," Vera Cruz, Papa
Da V‘mci’s, Kiva Han, Red Oak Cafe or
even T-Rav’s late night burgers (with
thetastiest meatprovidedbySaleem’s).
I love this, city, and the Dining Guide
seemedtobe,to me, alost opportunity
tohighlightsome ofthe bestplaoes that
make living here unique.

porters of the bill include state Reps.
Joseph E Markosek, D-25, Eugene A.
DePasquale, D—95, andjosh Shapiro,
D—153 — perhaps the bill’s most out-
spoken backer.

Shapiro said the HLDI’s results
proved inconclusive at best and de-

_ -ceptive at worst. -

, In an interview with The Philadel-
phia Inquirer, Shapiro cited statistics
about accidents involving hands-free
versus handheld phones. His statis-
tics showed that in 2009, just 479
accidents involved the former while
8,014 involved drivers using at least
one hand to hold a phone.

There’s no denying that distrac-
tions , including cell phones, increase
the rate atwhich accidents occur. Sha-
piro said, “This clearly demonstrates
thatlimitinghand-held cell phoneuse
limits the number of crashes.”

That claim is ﬂat-out deceiving
in its own right. In making his own
apples—to_—oranges comparison, Sha-
piro ignores lgoththe relativelylimited
number of people who own wireless

headsets as well a separation between

text— and call-related accidents.

- However, banning texting while
 government-imposed
nannying isn’t goingto curtail drivers
from doing it. As with underage drink-
ing in college, people who want to do

A ‘it are going to do it anyway.

MCT Campus

Where Shapiro or anyone inagree-
ment with his perspective ultimately
come up short-sighted is in realizing
the consequences of banning in-car
texting. Perhaps best illustrate_d bythe
HDLI study, drivers in states banning
the practice are just lowering phones
out of View to avoid a ticket.

So instead ofhaving drivers look-

ingup ataraised phone on the steering
wheel, the states with increased acci-
dents — including California, Louisi-
ana, Minnesota and Washington state
inthis study—— probably have drivers
looking down in their laps to ﬁddle
with their ﬁngers and phones. ’

Additionally, there are too many
loopholes in this bill to makeit ef-
fective. From GPS programming in a
phone to ﬁnding a.number, Section
3316 proposed bythe bill has enough
exceptions listed in it to makeit seri-
ously questionable as to whether this
legislation could even be enforced.

The art of legal drinking: Control yourself

 
  
 

Katie Azzara
Columnist

A few weeks ago, I accomplished one
of my life goals — I turned 21. My
September birthday has always been

a point of envy among my peers, but
never has the advantage of my age ’

been so satisfying as it was when I
became one of the ﬁrst of the class of
2012 to become a legal drinker.

And thus far, being 21 has more
than exceeded my expectations. In
fact, the transition from underage to
legal actually even came with a few
things for which I hadn’t prepared
myself. .

Thus, lest you repeat my mistakes

andthoseofsornanyothersbeforeme, ’

I offer to those of you who have notyet
reachedthis birthday—rnilestone acon—
cise guide to being a proper 21-year-
old. And for the already legal drinkers,
let this be a reminder to us all.

I hope I’rn not stating the obvious

whenl say that with unlimited access 

to alcohol comes great responsibility.
Allow me to create an image for you

Brown 4 9*

done at a red light;

Even whenl owned an automatic
car that freed up my hand and foot,
I still didn’t. But then again, I enjoy
driving and I realize I share the road
withcarsthatwould crush minein an
accident, so I drive defensively.

Rather than issue reactive legis-
lation to slap motorists on the wrist
for using a phone in their cars, pos-
sibly in urgent situations, politicians
should try to be proactive for once.
After all, driving is a responsibility

of how legal drinking, particularly at
bars, differs from the weekend ac-

tivities with which students are most
likely familiar before the age of 21.
Firstthings ﬁrst. Alcohol is expen-
sive. Especially at bars. Whatwith tabs
and cash and tips — oh my! — money

spent at the bar starts to add up quite _

quickly. But we’ll get to that in a min-
ute. _ ’

The number one thing to remem-
ber is not to get too out of control. Of
course, as my mother is constantly
reminding me,  is good advice for
any drinking situation. By the time
you turn 21, you’re hopefully already
familiar with some of the most harm-
ful consequences of consuming too
much alcohol, including potentially
lethal alcohol poisoning and emo-
tional distress caused by intoxicated
behavior and decisions.

And while there’s always a risk in-
volved with drinking, in a bar in par-
ticular, itis slightly more important to
remain composed there than it is at,
say, a friend’s house party.

Losingyour coolatabar—vorr1it—
ing, being belligerent, blacking out

— not a right.

In Germany, for instance, adriver’s
license cancostthe equivalentof more
than $2,000, according to The Ger-
man Way’s website, a site exploring
German culture. Germany also has
much more difficult  tests in
addition to required basic vehicle-
rnaintenance and ﬁrst—aid classes to
get certiﬁed. Both theory and in-car
tests are much tougher than in the
United States. .

Those requirements sound a bit

or partaking in any other form alco-
hol—induced sloppiness —— is, while
deﬁnitely not unheard of, absolutely
frowned upon, at least more so than it
is aﬁat party, where it so often seems
as if everyone’s number one goal is to
have his or her memory erased by the
end of the night.

Other than the obvious fact that
only bad things can come of such a
drunken state, you should not cross
that ﬁne line betweendrunkandwast
ed in  for the following reasons:
a) You’re in public, b) you will end up

spending more money than you ever '
thought possible, and c) you could kill

yourself. ‘
' Let’s ﬁrrther discuss the, second

idea. Sayryou find yourself in-'

toxicated in a bar. What do you want
to do? Keep drinking, of course. Thus,
you order more cocktails, eventually
losing track of how much money
you’ve spent, leaving you in a panic
for the next few days as you ﬁiriously
refresh your online bank statement
waiting for your last debit card trans-
action to appear. Mindyou, this is all
strictly hypothetical.

rigorous, but they make sense in a
country that has no’ speed limit in
many areas. In the U.S., we’re condi-
tioned to think of driving as a neces-
sary evil to getfromAto B, so we try
to multitask topass the time.
’Germ,anyfrontloads its drivingre—
quirements to weed out drivers, and
perhaps we should, too. One part of
the pending state driving legislation
I agree with would mandate 65 hours
of in-car training for junior drivers

But the important thing to re-
member is that there is a correlation
between how drunk you are and how
much money you are willingto spend.
Aiterall, it’s no secret that alcohol im-
pairs judgment.

In fact, I often ﬁnd myself over-
compensating for my fear of spend-

‘ ing too much by taking far too long

to decide what to get and asking for
the prices of each mixed drink, beer
or pitcher before making a decision.
This is, as it turns out, also frowned
upon, as it both wastes the bartenders
precious time, makinghimless likely
to approach you for your next drink
order, and armoys fellow bar-goers
to no end.

So while you should always be
thinking economically, it is bad form
to ask too many questions. My apolo-
gies go out to the patientbartenders of
Oakland who got me through my ﬁrst
few nights at the bars. .

The other majorthingthatIst1ug-
gled with upon turning21 was tipping.
I’ve received some conflictingpieces of
advice, from “always give $1 for each
round regardless of what you order,”

Additionally, states should man-
date required high-speed defensive
driving andmaneuverability courses
and tougher written tests. Because,
let’s face it,_ do any of us really trust
any other drivers on the roads, much
less in Pittsburgh?

’ As ofDecernber 2009, the HHS re-

.portedtherewere286 millionwireless —

phone subscriptions outstanding in
the U.S. — up from 194 million injune
2005.Aswe become rnorewired, that

to, “the point of tipping is to get extra
alcoholin your next mixed drink, so it’s
not necessary to tip for beer.”

A more valid answer comes from
the Huffington Post’s gratuity guide.
Published in August, the guide says,
“while bartenders usedto expect only

‘ $1 per drink, nowadays it’s customary
. to pay20 percentoftlieﬁnaltab, with

arninimum of 50 cents for soft drinks
and $1—2 on alcoholic drinks.”
However, accordingto a New York
Times article published last April,
when legal drinking was justa far-
off fantasy for me, it’s not about how
much you tip, butwhenyou,tip. Dining
Editor of the Times Pete Wells advises
bar—goers, “When you get your ﬁrst
drink, tip the bartender immediately,
and tip big.” Thiswill guarantee good
service for the rest of the night.
Of course, there’s much to be learned
by simply heading out to the bars
and experiencing it all for yourself,
but keep these guidelines in mind for
a smoother transition into the legal-
drinking world. —

State should promote good driving, not punish textersl

U Our governments should have better

things to do than go all Big Brother on
the drivers carrying those phones.
Instead, we should focus on mak-

ing drivers safer before they get on V

the road. A far easier solution would
be tojust outlaw the automatic trans-
mission. ‘

don’t reach your funding goal, you
don’t get any of the ﬁmds.”

Ford had a unique gift in mind for
one benefactor, who pledged enough
for a small painting. _

“She said, ‘I have some Moroc-
can heritage in my family,’ so I con-
tacted her and said, ‘if you let me
know where in -Morocco, I’ll go to
that place and get dirt or stones from
there and make your painting with
it,”’ Ford said. '

The artist has workedinareas out-
side of Pittsburgh to createher art-
work, so she’s learned how to capture
a region in mixed media.-Ford’s love

of nature and thebeauty of the West. ‘
Coast, where she had lived, helped

inspire her work.
“I always painted with vibrant

I colors and I always had this nature

theme,” she said. “I was in California,
livinginthe Redwood Forest in20o0,
and I was so overwhelmed with the
b_eauty ‘of the Redwood trees on the
coast and I just started paintingwith it
instead of [making paintings] of it.”
It’s taken some practice, but Ford
has an understanding ofhow to make

a piece work. The mediums the artist
uses depend on the weight and con-
sistency of her ingredients. ,

“I’ll do canvas and sometimes I’ll
do masonite boards if I’m going to
do something really heavy with a lot
of stones or sand. It really gets heavy
and I don’t think a canvas would sup-
port it,” Ford said. “It’s been a lot of
trial and error. I deﬁnitely had some
things that didn’t work so well at the

beginning, but I’ve been doing it for ,

so long that I kind of just have a feel
for things now.-” .

Pitt StudioArts professor Delanie
Jenkins explained that Ford’s use of
organic materials in her art isn’t new
to the art world.

“Artists have been using these
materials even before there were
artists, as a form of expression [be-

V cause] these were our materialsfrom
' the beginning of time, whether we
_ called ourselves artists or not,” Jen-

. kins said. '

She mentioned that Ford’s style of
art is present in pieces on display at
the Carnegie Museum. She discussed
a painting by Anselm Kiefer that uti-

MOVIE coLuMN

Tybout: Inconsistent styles obscure film director.

Andy Tybout
Assistant A&E Editor

Quick quiz: Have you heard of
“Se7en?” How about “Fight Club??”
How about the newly released “The
Social Network?’

Now -here’s a hard one: Have you i

heard of David Fincher?

Few directors inthe past 10 years '

have been as critically and commer-
cially successful as David Fincher, and
yethis name only registers with those
who zealously follow the ﬁlm indus-

, try. Maybe this is because Fincher’_s

canon is as disparate as a Beck album,
wholly lacking in a distinctive style or
theme. Or maybe it’s because he’s an
understated dude, forever absorbed

in thought, who doesn’t draw atten-
tion to himself. I .
Whatever the case, the release of
“The Social Network” merits alesson
in Fincher 101. Below I’ve compiled
a list of the last four Fincher feature
ﬁlms, rankingthem on ascale of me-
diocre, to classic. .
Mediocre: “The Curious Case of
Benjamin Button” (2008) This ﬁlm

I might ﬁnd favor among those who

felt “Forrest Gump” would be aperfect
movie if it had less character develop-
ment and more creepy CGI. 1, how-
ever, found -“Benjamin Button” to be
as bland as oatmeal, aﬁlmtoo caught
up in the novelty of a protagonist ag-
ingbackwards to pay any attention to
trivial» concepts like character, pacing
or original storytelling.

In fact, I would only recommend.
“Button” as a study in how ﬁlms '

adaptedfrom short stories _—- this
onewas originally a sketch by E Scott
Fitzgerald —- sometimes embellish
obtusely and needlessly to ﬁll time
requirements -- see also, “The

_ Grinch.” _ A
Decent: “Panic Room” (2002) Un— '

like “Button,” “Panic Room” doesn’t
suffer delusions of grandeur: This
is a thriller, plain and simple, and a
fairly good one at that. Jodie Foster,
whose roster of impressive nail-

-‘ biters is seemingly endless, plays a '

mother trapped in a safe room with
her daughter as thieves ransack her
house. Unfortunately forjogdie and
company, the robbers want what’s
inthe “panic room.” '

Fincher’s thriller is valuable not
only in its impeccable sense of sus-
pense, but also in its casting of two
relative unknowns that later became
household names: Forest Whitaker,
whose captivating villainy as a rob-
ber is magniﬁed tenfold iii “The Last
King of Scotland,” and Kristen Stew-
art, whose moody-daughter character
seems aﬁtting precursor to the melo-
dramatic Bella of “Twilight” fame.

Good: “Fight Club” (1999) The

vﬁrst rule of “Fight Club” is that you

don’t quote “Fight Club” at every
conceivable opportunity. Iwill, how-

’ ever, tolerate arguments that this is

Fincher’s most original movie. Atthe
very least, it’s his most iconic — if
every ﬁlm he made were as pulpy and
visceral, it’s a safe bethe’d be ahouse—

hold name by now. Since then, how-
ever, he’s opted for calm, collected
and competent ﬁlmmaking — three
qualities that don’t exactly garner a
cult following. . = '
As for the movie itself, you won’t
see it on my Facebook favorites. I’ve
always fostered a suspicion that be-

‘>

‘ neathallthefrenziedﬁlnnnal<ing,all

the suave Tyler Durden monologues
and allthe absurd twists, “Fight Club”
was more bluster than substance. ‘ ’”
At the same time, I’ll concede that
it has an aesthetic and a character
that lesser ﬁlms-can only attempt to
emulate. Also, it "contains one of the
best understatements in history. At
the end of the ﬁlm.— spoiler alert, of

ALBUM REVEW

 

Stevens not ﬁnished,  
but changing his sound

Ryan McGinnis
For The Pitt News
Suljan Stevens
The Age ofAdz
Label: Asthmatic Kitty
Grade: B+

Rocks Like: Baroque music and Elec-
tronica’s melodically gifted baby V

For ﬁve years we’ve heard mixed messages
about Suﬁan Stevens. He was done with his
50-states project (not surprising), done with
conventional songwriting and obsessed with
apart of I-278. Now, he’s resurfaced in a big
way, bearing unwieldy gifts.

The press kit for The Age ofAdz, Stevens’
ﬁrst LP of new songs since 2oo5’s Illinois,
counsels listeners to expect “no historical
panoramas, no civic gestures, no literary
maneuvers, no expository illustrations
drenched in cultural theory,” and so on. But
wait: isn’t all that the essence of Suﬁan?

Yes and no. The part _of Stevens that

 

conveyed emotion about social issues in
Americana—informed song—cycles is gone,
but Suljan the maximalist is alive and well.
If anything, the latter displaced the former.
And now synthesized beats have re—entered
his compositional toolbox, for the ﬁrst time
since 20o1’s Enjoy Your Rabbit.

It’s a striking development, sometimes an
awkward one. While Stevens’ new arrange—
ments are reaching higher and higher levels

ego, Tyler, and after he watches ﬁve skyscrapers
blown to pieces at his very hand, he turns to his
kidnapped girlfriend Marla and says, “You met
me at a very strange time in my life.”

Classic: “Zodiac” (2007) Fincher’s pre-
“Button” masterpiece, “Zodiac,” is an epic of
a different nature —, a true-life, decades-long
search for San Francisco’s Zodiac killer, with all
the failures, complications and red herrings in-
herent in a real police investigation. Like all great
mysteries, the audience is given the opportunity
to play detective, preempting protagonistsjake

Gyllenhaal, Mark Ruffalo and Robert Downeyjr.

in their obsessive game of puzzles. Be warned,
however: People are killed, characters waste
away and the murderer is never caught. But
while the ﬁlm ends in irresolution, the audience,
I’m conﬁdent, will leave satisﬁed.

Of course, one of Fincher’s earliest ﬁlms,
“Se7en,” also merits “classic” status, and if re-
views are to be believed, so does “The Social
Networ .” As for the latter, however, I’ll leave
that for you to decide — my only wish is that
when the movie ends, you’ll know it’s the work
of an experienced, and expansive, cinematic

mind. I

‘ “He’s using those materials to address his
country, which is Germany, and it’s history and
landscape,”]enkins said. _

The professor, who is entering her 15th year
at Pitt, has used organic media in her art as
well.

“I’ve used organic materials in my work that
I’ve actually grown and, for me, in growing and
harvesting tl1ere’s a sense of time and an invest-
ment in lime, observation and labor,” she said.
“It’s part of tlie artistic process, a different piece
might be about a different process.”

Ford has a different connection to the or— I

ganic media, as she uses what she ﬁnds naturally
rather than growing the materials. Yet she expe-
riences the same sense of unity with the earth.

“[All] of these materials are alive in their
own way and they just kind of live on in my

_ paintings,” she said. “The same feeling you’d

get when you see aﬂower out in nature or these
stones, you still can getinthe paintings  Nature
is where I ﬁnd my clarity and my peace, I can
just go ﬁnd answers there.” '
Ford believes it’s important for everyone,

 

and artists especially, to’ immerse themselves
in unfamiliar cultures.

“This world is bigger than just ourselves and
our community. We really are all connected and
we can make a difference in a positive way. You

just need to expand your horizons,” she said. '

Ford’s projectwillbe exhibited at the Istanbul
Grille on Butler Street in Lawrenceville either
the last weekend injanuary or the ﬁrst weekend

in February.

dumb.” The words are unguarded and con-
fessional, verging on pure pop straightfor-
wardness, but they’re nearly shouted down
by densely layered woodwinds, brass, elec-
tro—noises and backing choirs.

Stevens is too meticulous a songwriter
for any incongruity between his lyrics and
his music to be unintentional. The album’s
allusions to Royal Robertson, a paranoid
schizophrenic who felt humanity was rap-
idly approaching destruction, suggest that
Stevens wants to place his intensely personal

. narratives against a backdrop of apocalyptic

anxiety.

l

I,‘ .

id f’ I I

When musical pyrotechnics are too much
in the foreground, the songs are diluted, but
when the instrumentation stops challenging
Stevens’ singing and starts accentuating it,
the results are cathartic. The two standout
tracks — “All for Myself” and “I Want to Be

Well” — are bracing efforts at self-revelation '

that no fan will be entirely prepared for.

Moreover, these songs present a state-
ment of purpose that, while it may not ren-
der the album’s excesses more listenable,
does assimilate them into a conceptual
whole, press-kit-be-damned. Across all its
shifts in direction, The Age ofAdz is a search
for composure in the face of personal and
global doomsdays —— a search more gratify-
ing than tiresome.

Panthers bring in West Coast athletes

Ryan Samson I Staff Photographer

2 Jenn Katona(No. 6) and Kiesha Leggs both hail from California and
l have been key players for the volleyball team this season.

Torie Wytiaz
Stajf Writer

Santa Monica, Calif.: ocean views,
proximity to Beverly Hills and H01-
lywood, and oVer30O days of suneach
year. ‘

_ Why would anyone want to leave
such a place, exchanging perpetual
warmth for frigid winters and clear
seas for murky rivers‘?

Forjenn Katona, a sophomore on
the Pitt volleyball team and a native
of Santa Monica, this question has
become standard.

“People ask me all the time, ‘Why
would you leave California and come
all the way to Pittsburgh?” Katona
said. “I lived there for 17 years, but at
some point you have to get away and
see something different.” .

Katona, along with teammate Kie-
sha Leggs, represents the West Coast
on the Pitt’s women’s volleyballteam.

Leggs, a junior middle hitter, hails -

from Stockton, Calif., a city south of
Sacramento. ‘ —

While they share acommon home
state, both players route to calling Pitt
their home school was unique.

In high school, Leggs was a multi-
sport athlete, letteringin both basket-
ball and volleyball. However, she did
not play club volleyball, which often
provides venues for recruitersto scout
potential talent. _’ - .

“I did not play club volleyball be-
cause I was always playing AAU bas-
ketball,” Leggs said. “I went on to play
volleyballinaddition to basketball ata
junior college and was recruited from

there.”

Leggs was astandout player at San
Joaquin Delta College, earningall—con—
ference distinctions in her freshman
and sophomore years.

“I was recruited from schools on
the West Coast and in the Midwest,
but Pitt was the only eastern school,”
Leggs said. “They were also the only
Divisionlschool, which made the deci-

sion easier.” _ - ‘

Katona played a somewhat more

~ active role in herpresence at Pitt. She
composed a list of qualities that her

school of choice needed to have, and
beingfar ﬁ*om home was at the top.

“First, Iwantedtoleave California,
justto get some perspective of a diifer-
entplace,” Katona said. “Also, Iwanted
a school  a lot of people, a big in-
terestin sports, aDivisionIvolleyball
program andlgood academics.”
Hopingto pursue a degree inveter-
inarymedicine, Katonawas impressed
with Pitt’s educational opportunities
and its overall ﬁt with her require-
ments. :-
“I'recentlygotintouchwithastem-
cell research center that works with
animals, andlwillbe abletovolunteer
there,” Katona said. “The only other
place with that opportunity is in Cali-
fomia,” she said with a laugh.
Head coach Toby Rens asserted

. that many recruits are drawn to Pitt

from a distance because of the aca-

demic programs. _ *
“When we recruit, we are most in-

Penguins offer students opportunity to attend games

Student Rush gives kids a. chance to go to every home game this year, as opposed to only some like in the past,“

Donnie Tasser
Staff Writer

When Pittsburgh Penguins center
Sidney Crosby skates to center
ice to take the opening face—oﬁ'
tonight against the Philadelphia
Flyers in the ﬁrst regular season
game at the Consol Energy Center,
there will be a large contingent of
students -in attendance. No, it’s
not because there is a bunch of

enerous arents out there it’s '
3 P :

because of the American Eagle
Student Rush program.

‘ Any current high school or
college student with valid stu-

hour before game time. The line

technically starts ﬁve hours prior‘

to the game but frequently begins
to form earlier.

“The Student Rush has been
around since the mid—1990s
[1996], but gained most of its

' popularity around‘ 2005-06,”

Penguins Vice President of Com-
munications Tom McMillan said.
“We weren’t selling out, so we
decided to let students have the
extra tickets at a discounted price.
The kids loved it, and soon we had
thousands of students lined up to

. get the extra tickets.”

This year, the Penguins gave
a lotgof people early Christmas
presents when they announced
that the tickets would be offered

for every home game, not just se-
lect ones like in the past.

“I only went to one last year
[using Student Rush tickets],”

»“WIth the increased capacity of the

new arena, ithelped us make the ex-

ity of the new arena, it helped

' us make the expanded Student -‘

Rusha possibility,” McMillan said.
“There will be 200 tickets avail-
able every game, with four or ﬁve
dates where 500 to 600 will be

pended Student Rush a possibility.”

Robert Morris University junior
Nick Plavchak said. “I’m deﬁnitely
going to come to more this season
now that they are selling them for

Student Rush dates looked like a
party outside Mellon Arena. Stu-

dents would brave the terrible and

unpredictable Pittsburgh winter
to try and gainadmittance. TheyL__,
did all of this without amenities
like tents, grills, propane heaters
or alcohol, which are all prohib-
ited. »

‘ During select Student Rush
dates, American Eagle will be
hosting promotions prior to the"
game. Festivities will include a
DJ, promotional giveaways and
autographed items. a

volleyball program.”

Katona came to the Volleyball team as a re-
cruited walk—on in her freshman year. Both she
and Leggs have been integral members of the
team, earning playing time at the middle hitter
position.

Leggs turned in a complete weekend perfor-
mance, recording a total of 17 kills in Pitt’s two
victories over conference opponents Rutgers
and Seton Hall. - '

Katona has already eclipsed her freshman
year—end totals in both sets played and kills, in-
cluding a strong match against George Wash-
ington where she collected eight kills in a 3-2
Pantherwin. ,

Eiqaectations forthe season remainhigh, par-
ticularly in light of Pitt’s recent 7-1 streak.

“Our goal is to win the Big East,” Leggs said.
“This goal is attainable and I thinkthe team can

as well.”

Rens also noted that many members of the
volleyball team are natives ofwestem Pennsylva-
nia and that they help instill a sense of Pitt pride
in other players from greater distances.

“I am amazed with the pride that the local
players have in Pitt and the city,” Rens said. “It
really comes across as a strong feeling that can
be imparted to the entire team.”

For Leggs, that sentiment could not be more
true. ‘

“The team has become like a family to me,”
she said. “Outside of matches and practices, we

‘are stilldeﬁnitely friends.” ;’

Asupport system like afamily is acomfort to
Leggs and Katona, as their own families rarely
have a chance to see them play.

“We do not play anywhere near California,”
Leggs said. “My family will travel to Pitt to see a

at Pin’, thanks inlarge part to theirteammates.
“I deﬁnitely learned a lot from the team, es-

pecially as afreshman, in terms of ‘culture shock’

adjustment,” Katona said. ‘

For example, allthings winterwere foreignto

Katona before arriving in Pittsburgh.

“I knew nothing about hockey or who the
Penguins were before cominghere,” Katona said.
“Some ofthe players had to take me to buyawin—
ter coat, since I never really had one before.”

The infamous “Pittsburghese” slang also
proved to be a learning experience.

“Some of the words people use, Inever heard
before,” Leggs said.

Katona ﬁnds the dialect “cute” and looks to
other team members for deﬁnitions when nec-
essary.

Such instances of players helping each other
and developing friendships off the court are
characteristic of the team in general, according
to Rens.

° “Geographical diversity adds to the team
make—up and allows usto be more open—minded,”
Renssaid. “I cansee the team bonding occurring
and that translates into better play on the court

“My mom and step-dad will be here for the
Oct. 9 match against USF, ourﬁrsthome Big East
contest,” Katona said.

While their families will travel from the West
Coast, Katona and Legs still recall some other
comforts of homelthat Pittsburgh lacks, most
notably, certain foods.

“Mexican food,”Leggs said, withaslight long-
ing in her voice. “I can’t seem to ﬁnd a Mexican
restaurant here that is like the ones in Califor-
Ilia‘?!

Katona also has alistin mind.

“Organic food is harderto ﬁnd, and there are
some se1f—service frozen yogurt places in Cali-
fornia that are great,” Katona said. “The sushi is
different here too, although I do like Sushi Boat.
And Five Guys. I love that place.”

Katona and Leggs seem to have found their
place at Pitt, both as members of the volleyball
team and as students learning to be “Pittsbur-
ghers” for afew years.

“Pittsburgh is pretty much the polar oppo-
site of California, but I love it here and I know I
made the right decision in choosing Pitt,” Katona
said. I

last week. “Most of my friends-have gone in
the past and they always had a good time,
even waiting in line.”

Originally, the Student Rush sold what-
ever extra tickets were available at game
time. Several years ago, it was changed to
only include several dates because of the
unavailability of tickets stemming from
increased team popularity and success.

“When we started selling out games —

166 straight — we didn’t have the inventory 6

anymore,” McMillan said. “We liked the
program so we had to adjust and set dates
where the students could come get the tick-
ets. We didn’t want thousands of students ‘

To keep students in the loop about up-

began using text message and Twitter
alerts. You can sign up for text alerts re-

by texting “RUSH” to 32623. .
_ “I went to a couple student rush games
the past few years, and they were awe-
some,” Pitt junior Shane Nickolich said.
“You really can’t beat getting a ticket that
could be worth 90 dollars for only 25.”

The student rush tickets ‘.‘are scattered
—— not a block section,” McMillan said.
“Seat location was never the driving force.
It was to give the kids the opportunity to
see a game for cheap, and we knew the kids
would sit anywhere.”

“The most important part of Student
Rush is building a connection with young
fans,” McMillan said. “The program has
been a tremendous success and has helped
us build a consistently strong fan base for
the years to come, not to mention it helps
enhance the crowd inside the arena. The
