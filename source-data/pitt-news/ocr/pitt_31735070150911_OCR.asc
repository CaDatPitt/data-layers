Trustees
set salary
for general
counsel  

Gwenn Barney
Assistant News Editor

In a brief meeting Thursday
morning, Pitt’s Board of Trust-
ees approved a $350,000 an-
nual salary for new General
Counsel P. Jerome Richey.

When proposing the resolu-
tion ofthe Compensation Com-
mittee to the=Board at Posvar
Hall, Chancellor Mark Norden-
berg said that the suggested
salary “reflects both [Richey’s]
stature and experience as a le-
gal professional” and bench-
marking conducted by an out-
side compensation consulting
firm for the University.

Richey assumed the role of
general counsel, the Universi-
ty’s chief legal officer who holds
the responsibility of oversee-
ing legal affairs for Pitt’s five
campuses, on March 1. He suc-
ceeds current Executive Vice
Chancellor Jerome Cochran in
the position.

Cochran served as both gen-
eral counsel and executive vice
-chancellor —- Pitt’s chief busi-

ness officer — beginning in V

2004, but stepped down from
his role as general ‘counsel this
month to concentrate on “the

University’s increasingly com- p

plex array of business needs
as the University continuesgto
move through financially chal-
lenging times,” according to a

BITTER EN D

. Jasper Wilson V
Assistant Sports Editor

Exactly a year ago, the Pitt men’s
basketball team ‘beat a team in
overtime that had played inpthe last

two NCAA national championship .
games to advance in a postseason '

tournament.
That tournament was the Col-

lege Basketball Invitational, and

the opponent was Butler. That vic-

tory capped a three-game series,

a type of tournament format in
which urgency is not imperative.

Wichita State on Thursday at the
Energysolutions Arena in Salt Lake
City during a single-elimination
game. Despite the close nature of
the deﬁcit, Pitt never seemed to
have an interest in, let alone con-
trol of, the game.

“Today was not our day,“ Pitt
head coach Jamie Dixon said fol-
lowing the game. “They were ‘far
more aggressive than us early. I
don’t know why that was.” A

The Panthers shot 1-17, or 6 per-
cent, from beyond the arc, their

worst effort since not making any-
against Notre Dame on Feb. 18..

They also committed 15 turnovers.

Wichita out-rebounded Pitt 37-

overs, while also making use of the
free throw line, securing 33 of 41
attempts.

end a storied career with such a
lopsided, shocking result.

“It’s just a bitter taste in my
mouth to end my career with one
of the worst games I ever played
in my history of playing [at Pitt],”
the point guard forced out, sound-
ing short of breath and in between
sobs, which he tried to contain.
“I’m sorry I let my team down with
one of the worst games I’ve ever
played.”

Pitt student launches
street-wear clothing brand

Natalie Daher
S taff H/rite?"

The city of Pittsburgh is a melting pot with
history pouring over its edge and culture
steaming from its cap. And now Bryan
Shelmon, a budding entrepreneur on cam-
pus, seeks to use this melting pot to his
advantage in order to promote his new ap-
parel brand, Anthem Culture.

With the money from his own pocket and
the occasional eBay liquidation of sneak-
ers and clothing from his closet, Shelmon
transformed his fashion blog, “Anthem Cul-
ture,” into an outlet to sell his own street-
wear clothing brand. In November 2012,
a small collection of hats appeared on the
blog, and he’ll add T-shirts to the site April
1.

Asa junior ﬁnance and marketing major,
he learned in his consumer behavior class
that thriving companies break their mar—

keting strategy into projects, which has be-
come his tactic ever since. Shelmon applies
the lessons from class to further his new
endeavour on all fronts: multimedia, social
media and face-to—face communication.

A Michigan native, Shelmon ﬁrst pur-
sued a rapping career under the alias “B-
Shels” during high school, which also con-
tinued into his college years. During his
sophomore year, he performed at venues
such as East Liberty’s Shadow Lounge, at
home in Detroit and twice at Pitt Program
Council’s annual “Battle of the Bands.”
Shelmon, who still raps, along with his
friend and future promoter Shaq Smith
decided to create a brand to backdrop his

music, and they coined the term “Anthem

Culture” in 2010. _
Smith said the audience that Anthem
Culture accrued through B-Shels’ music

served as an essential fanbase for the cloth-
ing brand. Recently, Shelmon has put his
music undertaking on hold to focus on de-
veloping the brand.

Currently, Anthem Culture operates on -

a relatively low budget and does not col-
lect money from advertisers or any out-
side sources aside from its founder’s wal-
let. Shelmon works with Station Square’s

Embroidery Etc. to make the hats, and he -

brings his designs to Pure Screenprinting,
an eco print shop Downtown, which trans-

fers them onto T—shirts. While the_ hatsvare
sold individually at $28, the T-shirts are .

packaged with a small lookbook and two
stickers at $32. There are ﬁve styles of hats,
which are currently all sold out, and Shelm-
on printed 50 shirts for the grand debut
April 1.’

“Everything is pretty limited right now,”
he said. “Once we press up the next run of
shirts, we’re looking to increase not only
how much we have, but also just build off of
a smaller foundation.”

If the brand does expand, ‘Shelmon plans
to sell his‘ "products in boutiques ‘rather
than department stores, where the brand
could become “oversaturated.” He wants to
maintain the story behind the brand so that
wearers understand Anthem Culture, and
also feel as though their bodies are clothed“
in high-quality threads. _

“As far as clothing, you’ve pretty much
seen everything, so it’s hard to make it
new,” he said. “I look at it as people buying
the brand rather than the product.”

The Anthem Culture website began as a
showcase for Shelmon’s own fashion tastes.
It remains that way still, and Shelmon fre-
quently posts about trendy pieces from
brands such as the North Face, Ralph Lau-
ren and Diamond Supply Co. The presence
of Shelmon’s music fanbase paired with the
website’s reliable updates on the fashion
world will increase viewership such that

. dedicated viewers will ideally become cus-

tomers.

’ “We’re currently building our company,

and, once we have products to be released,
people who visit the site regularly will see
what we have and see the site transform
into our products,” Smith said. i '
' Anthem-Culture aims to spur an ideol-
ogy known as the “CultureHead” move-
ment. Shelmon described this movement
as_ a spinoff of the word '“sneakerheads,”
which refers to dedicated sneaker collec-
tors. Through his brand, Shelmon aims to
attract a following from a variety of cul-
tures within. Pittsburgh in order to unify
all of them under the umbrella of Anthem
Culture.

To achieve his goal, Shelmon has pur-
posefully ‘shot a few commercials that ex-
emplify the CultureHead movement. With
the help of T.K. Abdul, a junior majoring
in electrical and computer engineering at
Carnegie Mellon University,-he shoots these
short clips locally with CMU equipment.

The “I Am Anthem Culture” clip fea-
tures an Indian woman named Ruchika Rai,

whom he recruited for the project via Craig-
slist, in her own home performing various
customs such as trying on a beaded dupita

and sipping on a glass of chai tea.

“We are trying to show how her culture
is unique, how she hasn’t lost touch with
her culture and how her culture is still in
her life,” Abdul said.

Abdul, who assists as “somewhat of a

, creative director and adviser,” acknowl-

edged that chasing the entrepreneurial
dream as young adults certainly has its
challenges. Since ‘Anthemvculture is a per-
sonal project, major companies do not
sponsor the brand yet, and the contribu-

* tors currently operate. as a group of friends

participating in  enterprise that they ﬁnd
worthwhile. " T

M30 wpu
(412)643-7900 

“There’s not a television campaign on
an actual show or something,” Abdul noted.
“We’re students trying to do the best we can
with what we can get.”

Shelmon hopes to eventually use his ex-
perience to help other budding entrepre-
neurs brand themselves.

As Anthem Culture expands, Shelmon
wants the brand to gain global acclaim with
its approach of capturing cultures around
the world into a cohesive unit under his

' brand.

“Everybody would be under the Anthem
Culture umbrella,” he said. “But when you
take a magnifying glass and zoom in, every-
body has their different race,‘their different
background. And once you zoom out of ev-
erything, you see it as one collective.” I

For his dual role, Cochran received
a salary of $475,000 in the 2012 fis-

$493,000 in fiscal year 2013. Pitt

spokesman Robert Hill said no change

to Cochran’s expected salary has been
announced since he stepped down from
his position as general counsel.

salary figures for University officers, the
top ﬁve highest—earning nonofficers and
salary-earners who rank within the top
25' in the commonwealth...

 Cochran was the first general counsel
in recent memory to also receive ap-
ptointment as a University officer, an
administrative designation that carries
with it no additional responsibilities.

The Board of Trustees chose to ap-‘
point Richey as a University officer and
held a unanimous vote to approve his
designation as such at its winter meet-
ing Feb. 22.

Before accepting the position of gen-

eral counsel at Pitt, Richey served most
recently as chief legal officer and execu-
tive vice president for Consol Energy.

_ Richey also worked at the law firm Bu-
chanan, Ingersoll &_ Rooney, beginning in
1974, where he specialized in commer-
cial litigation, employment counseling
and litigation, governance and internal
investigations. Richey earned his bach-
e1or’s degree in philosophy and his law
degree from Pitt. During his time as an
undergraduate at the University, Richey
also competed as a distance runner,
earning two NCAA championships and

recognition as an NCAA All—American

Increasing Internet regulation

  doesn’t mean loss of freedom

Tiemoko Ballo
Columnist

“Information superhighway” was
a popular term used to describe
the Internet in the 1990s, and that
analogy is ﬁtting: Like the high-
way system, the Internet is a pub-
lic infrastructure our society and
economy depend on. But because
there are absolutely no restric-
tions, the Internet is a highway
‘without lanes, speed limits or di-
viders. Worse yet, near anonymity
is achievable, making the Internet
a highway on which not all cars
have license plates and police can’t
identify some drivers. Last year’s
bomb threats are just one familiar
example of the potential for abuse
this imparts. At present, the In-
ternet is a critical public domain
in which the government and law
enforcement have practically no
ability to combat cybercrime or
protect Internet users. ,
Internet regulation does not
have to mean censorship or a
roadblock on our information
superhighway. It can mean add-
ing some lanes and speed limits
for the public good: giving au-
thorities the tools to effectively
enforce the necessary laws/we
agree on. Internet regulation also

isn’t the antithesis of openness
or freedom. A national regulator
can safeguard nondiscriminatory
broadband access and guarantee
interconnectivity among the net-
works of rival providers, all while
protecting consumers from po-
tential abuse. ‘
Most people are quick to as-
sume that any government reg-
ulation of the Internet is a step
toward a totalitarian future where
censorship is prevalent and pri-
vacy is nonexistent. These fears
are not unfounded given the track

. record of proposed Internet reg-

ulation. 2011 saw both the Stop

2 Online Piracy Act and the PRO-

TECT IP Act threaten free speech,
innovation and the economy. But
trade organizations lobbied for
these acts, seeking to protect
proﬁts through the punishment

_ of copyright infringement. These

acts represent the disastrous po-
tential of misguided restriction,
not the beneﬁts of progressive
regulation.

A much lesser-known event in
the regulatory debate is the 2010
court case Comcast Corporation
v. Federal Communications Com-
mission. In 2007, Comcast —— an
Internet service provider, or ISP
—— received complaints about its

policy of blocking peer—to—peer
ﬁle-sharing applications. The FCC
ordered Comcast to stop forceful
P2P blocking, arguing that it im-
peded consumers’ ability to access
content and use applications of
their choice. This marked the ﬁrst
time the federal agency attempted
to enforce net neutrality. '
Though Comcast eventually
complied, the 2010 ruling by the
D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals stat-
ed that the FCC lacked the author-

I ity to regulate ISPs. At present,

no one has the authority to stop
ISPs from blocking sites, services
or applications, to prevent them
from using proprietary technol-
ogy that limits the interconnectiv-
ity of networks or even to ensure
that ISPs are providing advertised
broadband speeds. Because ISPs
have almost unrestricted control
over public Internet access, the
future of the web is in the hands
of corporations — not people.
Many are afraid that Internet
regulation will rob them of free-
dom, yet without regulation, there
is no way to uphold freedom in
the ﬁrst place. Moreover, if your
Comcast router is old enough, it
might still block P2P applications

without your knowledge.

Internet regulation also has the poten-
tial to greatly improve law enforcement’s
ability to deter, detect and defend against
cybercrime and cyberterrorism. All crimi-
nal activity in the physical world has an on-
line analog, and new types of cybercrimes
— as well as new methods to commit them
— emerge online every day. Law enforce-
ment perpetually lags behind the hackers
and crackers of the world: A 2012 report
by Symantec Corporation found 556 mil-
lion consumers are victims of cybercrime
each year. That’s 18 victims per second, not
including companies.

Likewise, there needs to be some enforce-

agencies to uphold consumer freedoms

Last season, Pittsburgh ﬁnished 8-8,

missed the playoffs and even lost to pe-,
rennial losers the Cleveland Browns. Yes,"

those Browns.

Now, three months after the season’s
conclusion — at least for Pittsburgh —
nothing seems any better than it did a few
months ago. If anything, things are getting
worse. Listen to any sports talk radio in
Pittsburgh and you’ll hear discussion re-
garding whether or not the Steelers are in
a worse position than the Browns.

So why is that? 1,

Free agency failure

So far, the Steelers have allowed receiv-
er Mike Wallace, tailback Rashard Men-
denhall and corner Keenan Lewis to leave

in free agency. Meanwhile, Pittsburgh re-
signed fast-fading 32-year-old linebacker

Larry Foote, 35-year-old wideout Plaxico
Burress and added backup quarterback
Bruce Gradkowski — if you can even call

it an addition.

But hey, the latter graduated from Se-
ton-La Salle High School, so he must be
decent because he’s a local guy, right?

The only good Steelers move thus far
was bringing back corner William Gay,

but Steeler Nation decried that move. Gay
spent the last season with the Arizona Car-

dinals, whom ‘he helped become the‘No.

5-ranked pass defense in the league.

In 2011, his last year with the Steelers,
Gay tied for the team lead with Troy Pola-
malu and Ike Taylor with 14 passes dis-
rupted.

But the real substance here lies not in
what the Steelers gained — which is very
little — but in what the team lost. In the
current day and age of the NFL, the most
valuable positions outside of the quarter-
back are arguably at receiver and corner."

The Steelers lost their best players at
each position, withno suitable backup or
replacement. Don’t ever try to argue that
Antonio Brown is ‘a No. 1 receiver or that
Ike Taylor can still be a No. 1 corner.

Wallace had more touchdowns over the
past four years than any other Steeler, and
Lewis led the entire league in passes de-
fended last season. '

There’s just no justiﬁable explanation-

as to Why that doesn’t warrant money for
the team.

iDraft-day misﬁres

Over the past ﬁve seasons or‘ so, the
Steelers found themselves in quite a com-
fortable situation. They had their team
with no immediate needs and the ability to
use draft picks to stock up for a time like,
well, right now: The future is cloudy, and

the Steelers face another possible season
without a playoff trip.

Maurkice Pouncey, 2o10’s ﬁrst—round
choice, worked out nicely. So has Law-
rence Timmons, 2007’s ﬁrst—rounder,
whose numbers through this point in his
career closely resemble those of Ray Lewis.

But other picks, such as defensive
linemen Cameron Heyward and Evander
“Ziggy” Hood, have yet to pan out. Plus,

2012 ﬁrst—choice offensive lineman David”-

DeCastro has yet to prove his worth after
spending most of the recent season on the
disabled list. C

And in later rounds, during which a
team is primarily built, many of the Steel-

ers’ choices have been total misses. Lewis ,

and Wallace were drafted later but are
now gone. Same with 2007 ﬁrst—rounder
Rashard Mendenhall.

Emmanuel Sanders, Brown and corner
Cortez Allen are really the only three im-
pact players the Steelers drafted outside 0
the ﬁrst round in recent years. —

Philosophy

Worst of all, the Steelers’ philosophy
is now one that just doesn’t work. Look
no further than the hiring of Todd Haley,

whose offense de—emphasized the big—play.,

abilities of Wallace and Mendenhall, as of-

The Steelers won the 2009 Super Bowl

The same goes for 2011, when the Steel-

lead the Steelers through‘ the playoffs —

Roethlisberger and the receivers did.

The signature play of that playoff run

‘was Brown’s 58-yard reception, which

he trapped on his helmet late against the 7*
Baltimore Ravens in the AFC Divisional I

Round. The pass helped complete a drive
