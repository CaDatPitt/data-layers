Corbett    
proposes
budget

Gwenn Barney
Assistant News Editor

For the ﬁrst time during Gov. Tom

Corbett’s term in ofﬁce, Pitt has es-

caped from the governor’s annual
budget address unscathed.

During his address, which began
at noon beforea joint session-of the
House and Senate onpthe House ﬂoor
at the Capitol, Corbett conﬁrmed that
he has not proposed any cuts to high-
er educationin this year’s budget. The
governor ﬁrst armounced his inten-
tion to retain ﬂat fundingfor state and
State—related universities this year
on Feb. 1. Pitt, Penn State, Temple
and Lincoln are the four Pem1sylva-

S nia schools that are considered state-

related universities.
Higher education

The new proposed budget appro-
priates $136 million to Pitt for the
2013-2014 ﬁscal year — the same
amount Pitt received lastyear. Cor-
bett’s proposed budget amounts to
a total of $28.4 billion, an increase
from the $27.4 billion he proposed
last year. ‘ . '

“We intend to maintain ﬁlll fund-
ing levels for state and state-related

universities. That is $1.58 billion that _

will gotoward these institutions,”
Corbett said before members ofboth
the Pennsylvania House and Senate.

The conﬁrmation of ﬂat funding
comes on the heels of an agreement
between the governor and the state-
related universities —— in exchange
for avoiding the appropriations ax,
the universities will work to keep tu-
ition-costs “as low as possible” for

STUDENT GOVERNMENT

  Pitt Day in ‘ Harrisburg reigistratipon extended

Mahita Gaj anan
Staff W rzter

In light of Gov. Tom Corbett’s budget
address Tuesday, students were once
again called on by the Student Gov-
ernment Board to join in Pitt Day in
Harrisburg. But in place of outright
political lobbying, students were
encouraged to bring their personal

_ stories to the state capital.

At Tuesday’s publicﬁmeeting in

S Nordy’s Place, Board President Gor-

don Louderback said to the room of
about 40 students that the deadline

to register for the armual event has
been extended to Thursday,‘ Feb. 7,
because of the govemor’s announce-
ment. Pitt Day in Harrisburgwill take
place on Tuesday, Feb. 12, giving stu-
dents the opportunity to travelto
Harrisburg and talk to state legisla-
torsabout ﬁmdingfor Pitt.

SGB Governmental Relations.

chairman Robert Beecher urged stu-
dents to join the event, even though

' it requires them to sacriﬁce a day

of class. He noted that he had been

excused from a midterm to go to

Harrisburg.

Beecher explained that afteraba-
sic training session on the bus ride
to Harrisburg, students would spend
the full- day event meeting with state
legislators; In atypical meeting with
state ofﬁcials, Beecher said, astudent
would tell apersonal story about his
on her time at Pitt. ‘For example, a
student majoringin ascience—related
subject could talk about a research
project and explain how he or she
has been successful because of the
University. '

“We don’t ask students to be lob-
byists,” Beecher said, explaining that

students who attend Pitt Day in Har- T
risburg will provide a personal side
to the ﬁght for funding. .
‘Louderback announced that he
had named sophomore Bryce Custer

. as the new SGB historian. Custer
~ will be responsible for document-

ing completed projects by the Board
members and going through news
articles and other documents from
the past to create adatabase of ac-
complishments. ,

students.

“Our commitment allows schools to plan
their budgets for the comingyear and make the
best use of their resources. Their commitment
should allow students and theirfamilies to plan
their own budgets,” Corbett said.

Corbett added a note on the motive behind
his proposed ﬂat ﬁmding to Pitt and its fellow
state-related schools.

“Our message to college students today is
that both my administration and the leaders
of your state and state-related schools are com-
mitted to making the dream of higher education
attainable,” he said.

Pitt Vice Chancellor Robert Hill said that
the University is not ready to comment on the
governor’s proposed budget.

“The Universitywillassess the budget mes-
sage before issuing further comment by the
chancellor,” Hill said, adding that Chancellor
Mark Nordenberg will testify in Harrisburg,
Pa., on Feb. 25 and 28 at the House Appropria-
tions Committee and Senate Appropriations
Committee, respectively.

However, at a press conference with Cor-
bett on Feb. 1, Nordenberg responded to the
proposed ﬂat funding by recognizing that the
agreement between the state and universities
was in line with recommendations from the
govemor’s Commission on Postsecondary Edu-
cation. The commission, on which Nordenberg
serves, was created by Corbett following last
year’s proposed hefty cuts to discover ways
to improve higher education in Pennsylvania.

“The governor then has taken the ﬁrst step.
He is moving us forward, consistent with the
report of the commission,” Nordenberg said.

Prior to Corbett taking office in 2011, Pitt
had received increased funding every year

between 2007 and 2009 and ﬂat funding in
2010. In 2011, Pitt received a 19 percent cut to
its previous allocation of $168 million, bringing
the University to its current allocation level of

$136 million. I
Though proposed ﬂat funding represents
an improvement in Pitt’s state—appropriation

prospects from 2011 — when Corbett recom- ..

mended a50 percent cutto Pitt’s appropriations
— and 2012 — when the University faced a—-30
percent cut — ﬂat funding still increases the
odds of a tuition increase for the 2013-2014
academic year. ~

Last year, the Pennsylvania Legislature
rolled back C_orbett’s proposed 30 percent cut
to Pitt infavor of ﬂat ﬁmding, but the $136 mil-
lion Pitt received still resulted in a 3 percent
tuition hike due to inﬂation.

Hill said the University is not yet ready to
comment on a potential tuition increase.

“While the University remains, as always,
committed to keeping tuition as low as pos-
sible, ﬁill consideration of tuition occurs after
the Commonwealth appropriation to Pitt is
law,” he said.

One week from today, hundreds of Pitt stu-
dents are expected to travel to the state Capitol
for Pitt Day in Harrisburg, an event at which

Corbett presented his budget proposal at the:l:'apitol’Tu7esda:;' "(enny orig lvisualiiditor

I" '1 Hill noted before’ the govemor’s address”

that, given-the proposed ﬂat funding, the focus
‘ofPitt7DayiiniI-Iarris  willsl'1ift,fromprevent- _
ing cuts to encouraging an increase in funding.‘



“Advocacy efforts, including Pitt Day in Har-
risburg, will center around increased funding
if ﬂat funding is proposed and if the Common-
wealth receives greater revenue thanprojected,”
Hill said.

The remainder of the address

In addition to higher education, Corbett
also touched upon the state’s pension crisis, a
plan to uncap the state’s wholesale gasoline tax
and funding for public education in his budget
address.

Corbett took a hard line on reducing pen-

V sions for state and pub1ic—school employees

in his speech. -

“The entire system of state pensions has
become a mountain of debt, and the avalanche
could bury our economic growth, swallow up
beneﬁts for our elderly, education for our chil-

dren and transportation for our economy,”
Corbett said. “Resolving our pension crisis will
be the single most important thing we do for
decades to come.”

The cost of state pensions is expected to
increase by $403.1 million this year for a total
of $1.26 billion if no action is taken. The state
currently employs 300,000 employees and
public school teachers.

, Corbett proposed the creation of “a new
401k-style retirement beneﬁt for our future
employees, consistentwith the retirement pack-
ages currently enjoyed almost universally by
private-sector employees,” as a solution to the

l pensionproblem,alongwithachangeintheway

beneﬁts are 'calcula_tejélfor current employees.
‘ The governor assured his audience that he
will not cut beneﬁts for those already retired

or “allow any pension dollars ‘already earned
‘ _ by any current employee to be diminished in

anyway.” g ,. g 
, - As‘ expected, Corbett reiterated his commit-

” l  . m:ent’toius'e revenues gained from privatizing
the state liquoristores as a means of funding

education. The governor estimated that selling
the currently state-run liquor stores to private
owners will open up $1 billion dollars in block
grant ﬁmding for education.

“Selling liquor is not a core function of gov-
emment — education is. We need to put our
liquor system into private hands,” Corbett said.
“Pennsylvanians have waited too long for the
day they could buy beer or wine at the grocery
store or choose from a greater variety of offer-
ings at privately owned liquor stores.”

Corbett also addressed the issue ofMedicaid
expansion in his speech. The federal govern-
ment has said itwill coverthe cost of expanding
Medicaid in each state until 2020, after which
it will cover 90 percent of the cost.

Corbett expressed skepticism for the idea
of expanding Medicaid, calling expansion a
plan “without any clear guidance or reasonable
assurances.” '

“Washington must provide a clear answer

Ill

meeting. Bobby Mizia | Assistant Visual Editor ‘

and Fundraising and Advertising Chair Erin

Worbs as “officers of the month” as part of his

‘ new effort to recognize certain members of
student government for their work.

Reporting on recent events, the Board

members who attended an information ses-

sion this past weekend on “The Big Even ”

—- the largest one—day, student-run service -

project in the U.S., according to its website —
at Texas A&M in College Station, Texas, said
they learned a lot about community service
projects that can be used to improve Pitt Make
a Difference Day. Board memberjohn Cordier
said he plans to work extensively in restructur-
ing the event.

Board member David Rosenthal, liaison
for the Collegiate Readership Program, said
he is working to ﬁnalize a tutorial video for

students to learn how to access online edi— I

tions of The New York Times and USA Today.
In mid—]anuary, Rosenthal said the Board had
to’ employ better advertising and marketing
tactics to raise awareness of the online editions.
“I really want to implore people to check out
your my.pitt portal,” Rosenthal said, explain-
ing that the links and directions to accessing
. the online editions are posted on the portal.
In his effort to implement more efﬁcient
transportation to the airport for students,
Rosenthal said he had hit a few roadblocks
with the Port Authority because of contrac-
tual issues. He is currentlylooking into other
transportation options.
Board member Amelia Brause said ‘her ef-
fort to expand the Healthy U campaign was

\

paying off, and that she would be meeting with
Student Health Services director Marian Vanek
to conclude her project, which includes a 5Kto
be held April 6. ’

Also related to Student Health, Board‘
member Sowmya Sanapala said she had met
with Vanek about her bi_rth—control initiative
as part of efforts to expand sexual education
on campus. '

“It’s gratifying to know that Student Health

. is behind us,” Sanapala said, noting that Vanek

had offered a lot of support to Sanapala’s initia-
tive to provide free condoms to students and
raise awareness about sexual health issues.
Committee chairs also gave updates on how
far they had gotten in their projects.
Environmental Chair Mizane Johnson-
Bowman said the group’s initiatives for the
semester were set. The initiatives include ban-

ning plastic bags on campus and replacing them ‘

with reusable bags, an Earth Day cookout, the
“From Blue to Green” campaign, placement of
Hydrationstations in recreational areas and a
recycling project in South Oakland; p '
Academic Affairs Chair Nuwan Perera said
he was trying to put together an outlined pro-
posal to publish OMET results. Perera said he
was also looking into more creative educational
options for students, such as a selfldesigned
certiﬁcate program — through which students
could ﬁgure out their own goals, devise a set of
requirements and create a certiﬁcate based on
theirinterests and completed classes — and

about what this expansion would cost the tax-
payers of our state,” Corbett said. “Atthis time,
without serious reforms, it would be ﬁnancially
unsustainable for the taxpayers, and I cannot
recommend a dramatic Medicaid expansion.”

The governor also unveiled a more detailed
picture of his plan to uncap a state tax paid by
oil and gas companies on the wholesale price of
gasoline. The tax is currently capped at $1.25 per
gallon. By removing the cap, the governor said
he believes that the state can open up approxi-
mately $2 billion infundingfor transportation.
But the change could result in increased gasoline
prices in the state.

“This is not a new tax, nor am I proposing
to increase the rate of the existingtax,” Corbett
said. “I am simply saying the time has come to
apply it to the full value of what the company is
selling. It is time for oil and gas companies to pay
their fair share of the cost of the infrastructure
supporting their industry.”

After two years of drastic cuts, this year’s

budget proposal saw less belt-tightening, most _

notably as a result of the governor’s recommen-
dation to eliminate 900 government positions.

Inthe coming months, the governor, House
and Senate will work together to negotiate dif-
ferent ﬁmdingpoints and adjust the budget. The
governor is expected to sign a ﬁnal version of
the budget byjuly 1 when the 2013-2014 ﬁscal
year begins. I

If the sales staff at theJ. Crew were

with all manner of bizarre-looking
electronics, walkie—talkies and oth-

er such implements of destruction, '

they nevertheless project an ineffable
coolness that I’m sure was drilled into
their heads duringthe hiring process.

There is one staff member that

If the J. Crew staff was decora-

J. Crew, I am making absolutely no ef-

the back and I have been identiﬁed
as highly unlikely to buy anything,
and thus not worth the opportunity

But this is all part of Apple’s well-

more of a position of gentle guidance
than authoritarian force. It seems to
be working: The store is absolutely

discover there are none prominently

tainly was a t1'ghter—run ship, as I have
not even seen a sales staff member-

What a bizarre assortment of box-
ers! I decide on four pairs, two plain
white and two light blue, which are
the only styles free of some bizarre
pattern of images or colorful designs.
Among them are different styles of
reading glasses, donuts, weight lifters
in silhouette, labeled animals in sil-
houette, broadcast towers, adrnit—one

hearts and chili peppers. What kind
of statement would I be making by
sporting chili peppers on my boxer

less one is in the habit of going about
sans trousers. There must be a select

breed of human beings that think it .

necessary to engage in a critical pro-
cess of determinihgwhat design their
boxer shorts will bear. In what kind
of scenarios do they imagine these
designs  be visually relevant? Or,
is -it a matter of intersubjectivity at

all? Need the wearer of an article of

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL

Looking for first Big East win, Pitt hosts
Providence in battle of struggling teams

Dave Uhrmacher
Staff Wrz'ter

Every team ﬁnds it difﬁcult to succeed when a
player from the starting lineup is injured. A
It’s even more difficult when a team loses its
starting point guard. Consider what happened
to the Pitt men’s basketball team last season
after Tray Woodall suffered an injury against
Duquesne. The team looked lost at times fol-
lowing the loss, eventually missing the NCAA
tournament for the ﬁrst time in a decade.

The Pitt women’s basketball team hopes to

' lavoida sirIiilar‘f'at'e'without"thé services‘ ofits‘ ' '

startingpoint guard, freshman Brittany Gordon,
on Wednesday night at7 p.m. when theytake on
conference foe Providence.

Still looking to earn theirﬁrst Big East confer-
ence victory since 2011, the Panthers welcome
the Friars (6-15, 1-7 Big East) to the Petersen
Events Center. Pitt (9-12, 0-8 Big East) enters
the game coming off a 78-60 home loss: to the
University of Florida on Sunday, a game

 

which the  shot a lowly‘8—for—20 fro‘ '

 

Pittwill  without Gordon -4- who 
tained a foot  on Wednesday night.

Her injury pressed sophomore guard Marquel

Davis intE>}point+guard duties on Sunday — her
pérforrnanée resulted innine points but also four
costly turnovers.‘  _
  The off'ense’ never seemed to get into a
rhythm with Davis orgsophomore guard Bri-
anna Kiesel running the point, and whoever is
responsible for carrying the ball up the ﬂoor
against Providence will need to do a much bet-
ter job of setting up teammates for open shots.

A Agnus Berenato, Pitt’s head coach, stressed
the importance of missing her starting point
guard after Sunday’s loss.

“I made the decision to go ahead and let Mar-
quel [Davis] run the point and put Bri [Kiesel]
at the No. 2_ spot,” she said. “My point guard is
out. She’s sitting on the bench with her crutches.
Marquel had to be the point today and that was
big. [She] hadn’t started for us all year. Marquel
is not a point, she’s a two. ”

‘Pitt will need consistent play at the point
guard position in Gordon’s absence to have any
chance ofbreaking its 28—game losing streak in
Big East Conference play.

And though the Panthers have yet to win a
game in conference play this season, they remain
conﬁdent after strong performances against the
likes of DePaul, Marquette and Notre Dame. V

TA$$ER’5 TAKE E
Puppy Bowl
entertains
some fans

  more than

   Super Bowl

Donnie Tasser
Staff W riter

Sunday marked two of the biggest sporting R
i Févéﬁtsiéftheyear. ’ N ' "   ' ‘

Super Bowl XLVII saw the Baltimore Ravens

 A defeat the San Francisco 49ers, 34-31, in an
: Va, exhibition ofoffensive mastery, shoddy
1 electrical work and mediocre commercials.

V Biifnot to be overshadowed by the Harbaugh
‘brothers’ coaching showdown (or a long—wind—
ed truck commercial about farmers) was “The
Biggest Game on All Fours,” Animal Planet’s

Puppy Bowl IX.
I compare arguably the largest spectacle of

American culture against the largest spectacle. -

of  cute animals blissﬁilly playingwith each
other.
Venue:VMercedes—Benz Superdome versus Geico
Puppy Bowl Stadium
The historic Superdome is no stranger to
_ enormous events, having housed seven Super
Bowls, countless big-name concerts and thou-
sands of afflicted New Orleans residents dur-
ing Hurricane Katrina. The Geico Puppy Bowl
Stadium, on the other hand, doesn’t even have
real stands.
But what it does have is a cool-down pup tub

and in—ground water bowl, neither of which are 

featured at the Superdome. But the kicker, of
course, is the lights. There wasn’t a 34-minute
blackout during the Puppy Bowl, now was there‘?
Winner: Geico Puppy Bowl Stadium

Participants: Players versus puppies

Obviously, all NFL players are ﬁnely tuned  V

athletic machines (well, except for Casey Hamp-
ton), and from start to ﬁnish the Super Bowl
was full of big plays and momentum swings.
The 49ers proved that with Colin Kaepemick
at quarterback, they will remain an offensive
powerhouse for years, and Joe Flacco showed ’
the Ravens that he is worth the big bucks by
helping Ray Lewis go out on top.

But man, did you see some of those puppies?

My favorite was Aurora, a husky-lab mix. In
my opinion, Sally the basset hound’s 30-yard

touchdown run was just as impressive asjacoby-— ~,

Jones’ 108—yard kick—retum touchdown. Seri-
ously, have you ever seen a dog move that fast?

beat then—No. 25 Villanova, 65-60, in overtime.
Providence trailed by 19 points at halfdme of that
contest. Senior guard and leading scorer Symone
Roberts recorded 20 points in the winning effort,
and her record of 14.5 points per game ranks
12th in the Big East this season.

Since that victory, Providence has lost three

straight games to conference foes Notre Dame, 1

St. John’s and Syracuse. ,

As the Friars lookto rebound from the three-
game slide, Pitt is presented with quite possibly
one of its best opportunities to earn avictory in
Big ‘East play this season.

A one—win Providence team may be the weak-
est squad Pittwill face in the Big East all season,
and the Panthers will hope to break the losing
streak before going on the road to face top—tier
teams in Syracuse and Louisville in the upcom-
ing week.

Junior forward Asia Logan will lead the of-
fensive attack for Pitt, coming off one ofher best
shooting performances of the year against USF,
in which she shot 8,-for—12 from the ﬁeld.

“Ijustfocused on going straight up and down
on my shot and making the shot,” Logan said.
“One of the other things I really focused onwas
when I missed a shot, to not get too upset or
worried. I just had to move on to the next shot
and not get discouraged.”

In what could be avery close game, the Pan-
thers will need to follow Logan’s lead and not get
discouraged if things don’t go their way early
against the  I

iiixcw ‘R

strated ﬁght at times this season on the road,
and it will refuse to go down without a ﬁght
against these superior opponents.

Next, Coach Agnus Berenato’s Panthers
will travel back home after the abbreviated

 

road trip for a quick two—game homestand. ‘

The ﬁrst game, scheduled for Feb. 20, against
the also-win1ess—in-Big—East-play Cincinnati
Bearcats, is a game Pitt should win. Cincinnati
has lost all eight conference games and only
averages 44.2 points per game as a team in
conference play.

Dare I say Pitt could have a two—game home
winning streak following the matchup with
the Bearcats? ‘

It is certainly within the realm of possibility I

for a program that needs a boost.

Georgetown, a team to which Pitt lost by 12
on the road, is scheduled to play Pitt on Feb. 23
at the Petersen Events Center. The_ ﬁnal home
game for the Panthers will come against the
DePaul Blue Demons, a team Pitt lost to, 57—55,
at the buzzer onthe road onjan. 29.

The Panthers, who sport a 7-6 record at
home this season, are certainly capable of

beating all four of the remaining visitors to ~

the Pete. ,
A healthy return for freshman point guard

absence of her two teammates, posting 14
points per game, attaining a team—high 63
assists and shooting 80.2 percent from the
free—throw line.

If Pitt can maintain a solid rebounding
advantage against any of its remaining op-
ponents, the chances of ﬁnally winning a
conference game will rise exponentially. The
continued development of sophomore centers
Cora McManus and Chyna Golden in the paint
will be also prove vital for the Panthers down
the stretch. .

A lot of things have to go right for Bere-
nato’s team to win, and on Wednesday night,
I think they will.

With four home games to go, Pitt should
win at least two.
