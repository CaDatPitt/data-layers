 system to get

finals trial mm

By Christine Hanna
News Editor

Pitt’s expanded transportation system will

A have a trial run during finals week, Student

Government President Gil Golden
announced at Friday’s SGB meeting.

SGB Public Safety Chairperson Shahla
Eberhardt said the North and South Oakland
shuttles will begin running at 6 p.m. on Dec.
15 and will run 24 hours a day until Dec. 19
at 6_ a.m.

The campus bus will run as scheduled and
the Sutherland bus will run 24 hours a day
beginning Dec. 13 at 8 a.m. until Dec. 19 at
6 a.m. ‘ '

The Van Call system will run as scheduled,
but Eberhardt said that it will serve as back-
up when needed.

“I encourage students to use the shuttles
and buses,” Eberhardt said.

The trial run will be a modified version of
the new transportation system. The new sys-
tern will begin Jan. 4,1993, if it is approved
by the Board of Trustees.

Eberhardt said that she is also looking into
safe study spots on campus and trying to get
buildings open and monitored for 24 hours
a day during finals week.

“I encourage students to use safe study
spots. The shuttles will cover these areas,”
Eberhardt said. , _

She also said even if students are not
studying, they should still utilize the shuttles.

SGB member Derrick St. Clair said that
SGB’s Public Safety Committee, Public Safety
Department and the Inter—Fraternity Council
have jointly created a safe walking route
around campus. The committee picked
routes that already had good lighting and
phones and ones that had university build-
ings with lights and phones. 9

The walking routes extend in three differ-
ent directions. One route heads toward
North Oakland down Fifth Avenue and turns
left on North Bellefield. It then turns right on
Bayard Street and then both turns left on
North Craig Street and stops at Centre
Avenue and continues on Bayard until North
Neville Street. '

The hill has a route upiUniversity Place,
around the Space Research Coordination
Center, up the steps’ to the fraternity houses,
down University Drive C and stops at
Sutherland Hall. There is also a route to
Lothrop Hall.

To South Oakland, Forbes Avenue is a
safe_ route up to Semple Street. Another
route follows Bouquet Street from Forbes
Avenue to Bates Street, turns right and goes
up to McKee Place. Atwood Street from
«Forbes Avenue to Louisa Street, and Louisa
Street from Atwood Street to Semple Street is
also a safe walking route. _

St. Clair said that bushes will be cut down
and lighting and campus patrol will be
increased on the steps up to the fraternity
houses and Sutherland Hall. 9

The increased patrol of the safe walking
route will start immediately, St. Clair said. He
also said that more students walking on
these routes will deter perpetrators of crime.

Cathedral climbers step up the pace

 

With his special stairclimbing gloves, Michael Traeger races up the Cathedral stairwells.

By Brett Fondrk
For The Pitt News

While most people were at.h_ome
getting ready to watch the Steelers,
51 people were ready for the
Cathedral Climb Sunday afternoon.

Participants in the event ran the
Cathedral stairs from the ground
floor to the top in groups of four.

A fruit and water station awaited-

the runners on the top ﬂoor, and
the Red Cross was on hand in case
anyone was injured.

The climb, sponsored by Pitt

Program Council, was open to any-
one who was interested. Everyone
who participated and paid $7
received a T-shirt, and the runners
with the fastest times received
medals. ,

Most runners felt that climbing
the stairs would be no easy task.
Senior Lori Shofran, who has run
the steps before, described the
climb as “challenging.”

Junior Matthew Gray said “I’m
going to suffer. I like pain.”

Climbers had a variety of reasons
for participating. “I just want to

make it up the stairs and take the
T—shirt home and_show my mom,”
senior Pam Moeller said.

«“It’s a Mount Everest thing,”
graduate student Pat O’Brien said.
“I did it last year and it’s a lot of
fun. I like the challenge.”

At the end of the race the
climbers had different reations..
O’Brien described the climb as
“brutal.” “I didn't ‘think I was
gonna make it. At about the 15th
floor, the elevator looked good,”
he said.

‘Town meetings’ atwist of ‘92 election

By Kim Pahniero
Staﬂ Writer '

The 1992 presidential campaign forever changed the“
relationship between the media and politics, said
Martin Walker, an international journalist who traveled
with President-elect Bill Clinton on his bus tour.

_ “Traditionally, campaigns have been in the hands of
people like me. And now it’s who1esale,” he said,
pointing to the candidatesf newfound ability to manip-
ulate images though talk shows and buy television

time —— electronic town meetings.

“Ethics, the Media and the ‘92 Election” was the title
of Walk_er’s lecture which drew a crowd that packed

the Frick Fine Arts auditorium last Thursday.
Sponsored by the School of Library and Information

Science, Walker's lecture was part of the Dean’s Forum
on the Ethics of Information in Society, an annual
event designed to promote the discussion of ethics.

“Your country has undergone a Teutonic shift in val‘-
ues; not so long ago we thought a candidate involved
in adultery was finished,” Walker said.

He said this year’s campaign has demonstrated a shift
in focus in the media. ’

“What is interesting about this year’s campaign is that

-the media dropped its standards as Bill Clinton

dropped his trousers,” he said, drawing laughter from

Loneliness aproblemfor many students

- Many students come into the
Counseling Center and conﬁde
that although they are sur-
rounded by people, they are
terribly lonely. This loneliness
has many faces. Some students
have felt isolated and lonely
all their lives. Often shyness or
the fear of talking with others
has been the stumbling block
to their developing an active
social life. Other students may
have felt connected to people
in the past but find it more dif-
ficult to develop a social net-
work on campus. They may,
for example, have developed
friendships in their home com-
munities over a long period of
time but find it impossible to
handle the fast—paced social
environment of a college cam-
pus.

Another segment of lonely‘

people may have previously
met their social_needs through
a romantic relationship and

‘isolation,

feel lost once the relationship
ends. Others may have same-
gender friends but feel inca-
pable of establishing intimate
relationships with people of
the opposite gender.

sensitivity leads to further
withdrawal and discourages-
other people from moving

could be rejection sensitivity,

self rejection or just a lack of

social skills. If the problem or
problems can be identified,
strategies for change can be
developed.

The most important first step
is to take personal responsibil-
ity for one’s unhappiness and

to determine to do something
-about it. Passively waiting for

the situation to improve is not
going to work, nor will blam-

with the loneliness problem

to begin the self-evaluation
process. The answer to this

personal concerns, lies within-

you. Learn how to approach
your problem now, and you
may change the quality of the
rest of your life.

Zen teacher Richard Rose speaks on his quest for the truth

By David Weimer ~
Staff‘ Writer

Zen teacher Richard Rose spoke to
approximately 100 people in the

William Pitt Union Ballroom Thursday

night.

Rose’s lecture was unlike that of
most professors and instructors at Pitt.
It followed neither an obvious outline
in theme or chronology. Nor did it
refer to a tangible subject. He was talk-
ing about the search for truth, his life’s
quest. 4 . ~

Two female students expressed their
disappointment at the lack oflclear
instruction. “This guy is out of there,’_’
one student said to‘her friend. Their

skeptical, disappointed muttering grew '

 

louder. Finally, they left.

Rose paused in his oratory and said
that he would “give a nickel to know
what [the two girls who just left] were
thinking.” -

He explained that there was a “sys—
tem” for achieving enlightenment, self-
definition or realizing the truth. His
system was not an easy-to-understand,
step-by-step method of getting there. ‘

Rose said that the person’s religion,
race or ethnic group is not important.

“The mind is the only step to the
soul,” Rose said. ,

Michael Neely, president of Pitt’s Self
Knowledge Symposium, said that he
thinks people try to make more out of
Rose’s ‘message than there is.

“It is about living a truthful lifeland

people aren’t ready for that kind of‘

commitment,” Neely said.

The two disgruntled students were
not the only ‘ones who left the lecture
early.

“He knows that his message isn't for

.everybody. If he finds one or two peo-
ple who are genuinely interested, I ‘

think that he feels he accomplished
what he was there for,” Neely said.

Neely added that his group is a non-
denominational, esoteric study group.
“We do not follow a specific dogma.
There is a weekly topic at each meet-
ing and various members give their
feedback on it,” Neely said. ‘

A Pitt. student in the audience, who
wished to remain anonymous, asked
him about the time following his expe-
rience of enlightenment. “Were you
completely satisfied with the answer
you got after searching all your life for
the truth?” Without hesitation, Rose
answered “Yes.”

Paul Schmidt, a Self Knowledge
Symposium member, has known Rose
for several years. Schmidt said that
Rose is attempting to communicate
what he experienced when he reached
“the apex of a lifetime spent in the
search for truth.

“It’s all he ever wanted to find. He ’

wanted to know exactly who is this
person who was experiencing this life,”
Schmidt said.

Batman, X-men are ho narary
members of Comic Book Club

By Alison Irwin
Staff Writer

The X-men, Wildcats, Youngblood and
Batman are alive and active on the Pitt
campus through six students who have
been meeting regularly for nearly three
years.

Joe Babinsack has headed the Comic
Book Club for the last year and continues
to do so even though he has already grad-
uated from.Pitt. He also is head ‘of Students
Against Racism. ‘

“[Comic writing] is what I hope to be
doing in the future,” Babinsack said. “It’s
not just the interest, I hope to be. involved
in the profession.”

Other members of the group said they
felt that comics are an art form.

“It’s art for one thing,” club member Dan

_ Crow said. .“It’s as diverse as writing short

stories and fiction.”

Member Karen Fishkin agreed. “You take
a very simple story and you elaborate on it
and add pictures. It makes it all the more
magical,” she said. 9

‘The group also critiques the member

writers and artists on their artwork, story-
lines and characterization.

Crow said of one writer, “He is the Andy
Warhol of comic books. Everyone looks

« the same.”

The members get together to buy and
sell from each other and to find people to

work with. But the club‘said it is much,

more than that — it brings comics to life.
An outside observer might not realize the
club is discussing a comic book character.
They talk about the characters as if they
were real, examining their personality and

ﬂaws. They also speculate what the charac- 1
ters will do in the future and what would ,

happen, if characters from different comic
books were to meet.
Fishkin said, “Now Batman [has] met the

Predator... everyone [has] met the Predator. 4

Soon Barbie will meet the Predator.”

Another member said one of his char-_

acters will meet the Predator soon,
too. - _ _ -
The group meets each week on a regular
basis.

Clinton makes a move I

Ever since the rise in President-elect Bill Clinton’s populari-
ty, we have heard nothing but news about the economy. So
much, in fact, that America wondered what else a Clinton
presidency would be like. The first 100 days, Clinton said, will
be nothing but policy decisions centered on improving our
nation’s economy. There willbe a new tax raised on the
upper 2 percent of society, worker—training programs imple-
mented to improve productivity and short-term massive work
programs aimed at building our nation’s infrastructure.

So what is Clinton’s ﬁrst policy decision as presidentelect of
the United States? If you guessed any of the above, you’re
wrong. Clinton decided to follow through with his promise to
end the Department of Defense’s policy which discriminates
against homosexuals and prohibits them from joining the rnil—
itary.

sion as well. But despite our surprise at his ﬁrst major policy
decision, we must -applaud President-elect Clinton for

addressing an issue which_ all too often has gotten pushed “
‘aside. In the face of the military and leaders who are threat-
ening to resign over this decision, the president-elect held.

part, been responsible for perpetuating society’s fears of
homosexuals. After all, just like homophobia has been a con-
stant throughout our history so has the  By attacking
one, he is attacking the other. '

Some people, like Gen. Colin Powell, have said that it is a
question of national defense and that removing the ban
“would be prejudicial to good order and discipline,” and adds
“it is diﬂicult ir1 a_  setting where there is no privacy.” g

tary. The only diiference is that the military won’t, be openly

Our question now is, how will this decision of President-
elect Clinton effect us here at Pitt? The struggles between
ROTC and BiGALA have been created prevalent issues on
campus ever since we can remember. And while we are not
sure how ROTC will react, we are sure of one thing:
Chancellor O’Connor can lay back in his easy chair because
Clinton’s initiative is one less decision that O’Connor will have
to make.

Of course Clinton’s decision will not immediately bring to‘

an end the discrimination that homosexuals face. But in mak-
ing this decision, Clinton has gone a long way in proving the
leadership skills that many questioned during the elections.
He is not only taking on a policy that has lasted for centuries
and he is not just battling our military leaders. ’
No" — Bill Clinton is addressing the larger problem of the
hate and fear that so many practice simply because of igno-
rance. E

Silence accentuates the problems

America’s hatred has ’many
targets. But there’s a distinc-
tion between one of them
and the rest. The hatreds of
racism, sexism, classism and
religious intolerance are no
longer socially acceptable.
But as some recent events
s_how, homophobia is open,
advocated and everywhere.

On election day, Colorado
voters passed Amendment 2
to their state constitution. It
enables the state and local
governments to pass laws
that discriminate against

I gays and lesbians.

Colorado voters have said
to their gay and lesbian
neighbors,_ “We hate you,
hope you leave and will. not
protect you.” And to my
amazement there has been
no denouncement of the
amendment from our free-
dom-loving society. Excuse
me for being naive but I
always thought that the pur-
pose of a constitution is to
grant “inalienable rights,”
not take them away. '

About three weeks ago
there was a class on this
campus where students
were reading “Dear Abby”-
type excerpts from several
magazines. One - student

read a letter written by a.

woman who was confused
because she had been mak-
ing love to a female friend.

The student would often
stop reading to make rude
comments about the woman
and burst into’ laughter.
Then the other students
would join in, creating an
hysterical frenzy of verbal
gay bashing. In the midst sat
a bisexual woman who felt
enraged.

No one opposed their

open display of prejudice,.
not even the teacher. This

silence gets interpreted as
acceptance whether the
teacher liked it or not._This
silence has not only loomed
around the country and on

this campus, it was in me as

well.

I was talking with a group
of people last week, and
one individual was joking
about personal ads, espe-
cially the ones from gays
and lesbians. Everyone was
giggling, ‘' except me.

Although I knew he was"

wrong, I kept quiet.
Normally I’m happy to
play devil’s advocate, but
this time I did not. I justi-
fied my inactions by think-
ing “I’m not in the mood for
a debate.” Sorry excuse. It
won’t happen again. I will
no longer let a verbal gay-

Josh
Obusek

basher go un-checked. I

_ have a. voice, and next time

I’ll use it.

Whenever a person is dis-
playing his or her anti—gay
prejudice,'he or she must be
confronted. If not, this per-
son will go on feeling justi-
fied. Gays and lesbians will
not be able to enjoy their
rights as human beings until
the majority of us begin to
confront the prejudice
against them.

If the Colorado amend-
ment, the student or the
person from last week
would’ve targeted African
Americans or women, they
would’ve been rejected.

Hate has no boundaries. It_

is'the same regardless of
who it is you are talking
about. Homophobia must
considered the same as the
the other shallow, mindless
hatreds and receive the
same denouncement.

Whenever an issue arises
that affects the gay and les-,
bian community, the only
support they receive is their
own. The Civil Rights move-
ment received substantial
support from whites.

And the fight to maintain
a woman’s right to" choose

an abortion has received.
much support from men,
especially gay men. But the
gay and lesbian community
is left to fight alone. It’s not
enough. There should be
help from all heterosexuals
who love freedom.

Ideally, this country was
founded on the principles
“of liberty and justice for
all.” School children recite
this pledge of allegiance
every day in school. Yet, in
states like Colorado, they
are taught that liberty is
nothing more than an empty
promise. Freedom for every-
one? I

Freedom includes the right
to work, go to school, have
a home and be yourself.
Come to think of it, maybe
it is only heterosexuals that
should enjoy these radical
rights.

So why are gays and les- '

bians bashed every time
they try to secure their
rights? It’s states like
Colorado which perpetuate
this hatred.

It’s the same institutional
establishments which pro-
vide for our security that
take it away. It is the church
which teaches us to love
and be tolerant, yet also
teaches that it is OK to hate
gays and lesbians. J

These days, gays and les-
bians are the. number-one
target. But let us ask the
question what does freedom
mean? There are plenty
of people opposed to reli-
gion, but they don’t try to
deprive churchgoers of their
rights. I

There are plenty of liberals
opposed to conservative
ideology, and they don’t try
to deprive conservatives of
their rights. To live and let
live is not a very difficult
thing to do.

CAS registration
needs revamping

It all started last month when I made an
appointment with my advisor in the CAS
advising center. First mistake. It tumed out
that I needed to make appointments with two
advisors, neither of which being the advisor I
had made my appointment with. .

Unfortunately, the advisor in CA8 didn’t let
me know this until my appointment, which
was two days before registration began.
“Sony, I can’t help you. You’ll have to call
these people here.” _ '

She gave me the numbers of the English
and anthro departments. Needless to say,
both were out to lunch (at 2 p.m.), and when

S I ﬁnally got through, I was infonned that nei-

ther of them could see me until the middle of
November.

Are you aware that there is only one
anthropology advisor in the entire Pitt sys-
tem? Well‘ there is. Pitt is supposed to be
among "the top three anthropology schools in
the country, and it can only afford to employ
one advisor for the entire department. The
English department has double the anthro-
pology staff —— two advisors.

I knew I’d have to register without the help
of an advisor, so I went in search of a regis-
tration form.,Incidentally, it can only be

obtained at your advising appointment. In the '

end I found one, and with a wink and a sig-
nature from one advisor who barely glanced
at the courses I had selected, I was on my
way to register. I won’t even mention the
line.

After registering for my courses, one turned
out to be closed. No problem, it was a course

Chris

Diersen

in my major and a special-permission fonn
would be just the ticket. No dice. The course
was closed except for seven seats which
were being held open for engineering
majors! Is there any question where this uni-
versity’s interests lie? ' "

I finally got to see an advisor, after register-
ing (1 still haven’t spoken to an anthropology
advisor). But when I asked for help on plan-
ning my schedule for my senior classes, my

jadvisor went totally ballistic and called me

everything but an idiot.

Why is it such a hassle to get this simple

task taken care of? There are a lot of reasons,
all of which can be traced_back to their
source —— the Pitt bureaucracy. One look at
any aspect of this school will tell you why
there is no money to pay more advisors or to
fire up a telephone registration system. The

William Pitt Union, for example. Take a look .

at some of the organizations that suck up
your tuition. How about Pitt’s Medical

School? How about the sciences? Do you .

think that these factions of the u‘niversity are
gasping for funding?

Certainly not. These areas of study provide
a device of recognition for the university and
therefore, are placed first when it comes to
spending priorities. A ,

Pitt ‘needs to focus on the average student.
The College of Arts and Sciences at our

school is in need of a revamping and a clean- \

ing-out. Almost as great is the need for. this
school to display a little fortitude when it
comes to funding the various splinter groups
our money sponsors. Looking at the present
list; I am anxiously awaiting the addition of
an “Angry Fat People Alliance.” What next?
Students in the CAS programs need to
make a stink. Write letters. Don’t call people,
put your opinions in writing and you’ll be
heard. Remember, it’s not the irritated advi-
sors and frantic individuals in the registrar’s
ofﬁce who are the cause of your hardship,.it’s
the Pitt bureaucracy that fails to recognize the
need for improvements in the CAS programs.
Just thought I’d let you know. »

Predicting the future is a terrible
task, and that’s clear because the few
who dare to predict the future often
turn out to be wrong. But. somebody
has to do it. .We have a new presi-
dent and a new Congress coming,
and we need to see what the future
has in store. To understand Clinton’s
policies in the future one has to
understand how the Clinton adminis-
tration will operate policy—making in
general. Consider some things that
only the governing elite seem to talk
about amongst themselves:

(1) Clinton will probably pick advi-
sors from the academic elite and the
political elite. .

Clinton, a former professor himself,

will probably follow Kennedy’s 9

example and look at the faculties of
Ivy League universities for key_ advi-

_ sors. The policy-making of academics

can often result in well-crafted policy
plans, but the plans may often ignore

the interests of the people crucial to

passing and implementing them.
Look for lines of battle between the
academics and the political operators
in Clinton’s cabinet in the future.

(2) Clinton will initially rest his
power—hase on. his relations with
Congress and then later draw power
from the public.

After winning 45 percent of the
popular vote, Clinton has no popular

-mandate to do much of what he
-promised, no matter how the elec-

toral college came out. The majority
simply demanded change, it did not

Ed. Kichline wrote that the
Republican Party looked as if the
ultraconservative, religious right
were overtaking it.

Whatever they did, I embraced it.

George Bush and Dan Quayle tried?

to fight the onslaught of the media’s
bias and Hollywood’s profanation
of morality. Of course, they lost this
fight for tradition.

I watched television on Nov. 3

‘hoping for a miracle comeback by

Bush and_Quayle. Despite the loss,
I hope the Republican Party does
not change. _

Is there anything wrong"with try-
ing to stop a baby’s head from
being crushed by forceps in an
abortion?

Is there anything wrong with
fighting for a mother/father relation-
ship in a family? Dan Quayle fought
for the most stable home environ-
ment for children and was ridiculed
for it. If people who supporttthe
correct morals need to change, then
maybe you’re right, Ed. ‘The
Republicans should sell themselves
out for votes. Then again, how
could they outdo Bill Clinton at
that? He did the best job of that I’ve
ever seen. .

You might say there’s more to a
leader than his morals. Wrong.
Clinton could offer me millions, and
I’d just pity him. To those who
voted for Clinton, what good is,it
for Clinton to gain you the world if
you lose your soul in obtaining it?

agree on what changes should be
made. He will continue governing as
if it were a continuing campaign to
gain the popular support he needs.
In the meantime, Congress is going
to give him 100 days to establish his
administration. Clinton’s best strategy
is to win a few quick legislative vic-
tories to prove his political skill and
attract support to his policies.

. Lobbyist-bashing and perk-bash-

sional reform will eventually come.

Clinton’s advisors have stated in
The New Yonk Times that Clinton will
continue holding town meetings and
taking bus tours across America as
he did in his campaign.

This is to get out his message to
the American people. He is only like-
ly to campaign in the suburbs among
the middle class more than anywhere
else. 

The 1990 census reported that
about one half of the country now
resides in suburbs, and it now consti-

apologize? How dare the PPC spon- .

debated freely. God forbid that a
university should have a provoca-

suppose the PPC should not spon-

cally correct.” °

Louis Farrakan, a controversial
leader of the Black Muslims, was
sponsored to speak at Pitt in the
past. Like Gates, Farrakan has been
labeled a “bigot,” yet the BAS did
not oppose this speaker. With the
history of othercontroversial speak-

endorsed by the BAS, it is outright
hypocrisy for BAS to oppose the
sponsoring of Daryl Gates’ debate.
Nothingbut political censorship is

I find itdangerous and a threat

interest groups. dictate who may be
solicited to speak. Political censor-

often at many public and private
institutions throughout the decade
of the '80s. To demonstrate and
protest against Daryl Gates and his

exercise, but do not try to prevent
the expression of those thoughts.

(3) If Clinton sticks to his economic
plans, the deficit will he reduced, hut
not as much as promised.

Clinton’s estimates of growth in the
tax base are based on the President
Bush’s official estimates of how fast
the economy will grow.

Official presidential predictions of

economic growth have always been . ‘

too optimistic, and several econo-
mists _have said that Clinton will not

, get as much tax revenue as he pre-

dicted.

Furthermore, Clinton has been
consistently vague on how he will
raise money for new programs. The
result is that the gap between taxes
and spending is going to be bigger
than expected under Clinton’s plan.
One option for Clinton is to scrap
parts of his plan and simply spend
lesson domestic "programs than he
promised. '

But Clinton has already stated sev-

eral times that jobs and economic

growth are a bigger priority to him
than the deficit. Thus, he is more
likely to break his promises on the
deficit. Since deficit reduction is so
politically unpopular, it is on taxing
and spend policies in which Clinton
will have to show strong consistent
leadership in the future.

Pennsylvania Senate race made

national headlines. In your Nov. 4 ‘

article “Specter rallies, defeats
Yeakel,” you reported that
Republican candidate Arlen {Specter
received 51 percent of the vote and
Democratic candidate Lynn Yeakel
received 49 percent. These same
statistics were reported in numerous

publications throughout the coun—'

try, including The New York Times
and USA Today. Since these figures
add up to 100 percent, they imply
that no other candidate received
any votes. '

But those figures are false. In
truth, Libertarian candidate John
Perry received 5 percent of the
vote.

— The'news media reported these

incorrect figures intentionally. They _

essentially said that the Libertarian
candidate received zero votes. The
news media ‘has insulted Mr. Perry
and the roughly 200,000 people
who voted for him, including
"myself.

People believe that the election
percentages they see reported in
newspapers are accurate. Election
percentages are objective numbers
that any reasonably bright 10 year
old could correctly calculate. There
is no excuse for what the news
media has done.

Watching from the sidelines, the cold was
sinking in. Wearing a baseball cap and coat,
Alex Van Pelt could see things slipping
away. .

He was disappointed. The words “five
interceptions” swirled inside his head like
the chilling winds on his face.

And as the Panther quarterback walked
‘out of Pitt Stadium for the last time, he was
numb. Not" from the weather’ but from the
icy 31-16 drilling that Van Pelt and Pitt
received at the hands of Louisville on
Saturday. .. ’ .

During a third-quarter explosion,
Louisville scored 21 points in eight minutes
and dashed all hopes for a Panther victory.
The Cardinals used three straight Van Pelt

make Pitt’s No. 10 lose all feeling.

“It’s disappointing,” Van Pelt said after the
Louisville debacle. “It’s embarrassing to play
this way. _ '

“I let the team down today, it’s the worst
game -I ever played as a Panther. It’s just
disappointing that Iletthe team down.”

Panther head coach Paul Hackett said he
did not buy the part about letting the team
down as he stressed the team effort.

“We win and lose as a team,” Hackett
said. “Alex takes too much of the damage. I

marched 80 yards for its first score.
Surprising the Pitt defense with runs not

if executed by starting halfback Ralph

Dawkins but by reserve Anthony Shelman,
Louisville moved the ball. But it took a 46-
yard strike from quarterback Jeff Brohm to
Kevin Cook that set up the Louisville score.
Three plays later, Shelman took it over the
top for the Cardinals’ 7-0 lead.

With injuries and controversy-sur-‘

0-1-1 in its last two games with a 4-4 tie

at home against Quebec last Thursday-

and an 8-0 loss in Detroit on Friday.

In Thursday’s sellout, the Penguins
held one-goal leads on four separate
occasions with the Nordiques always
answering back to tie the game. Right
wing Joe Mullen, the game’s number-one
star, scored twice for the Pens while
Claude Lapointe led the way with a goal

Louisville's Kevin Gaines denied Pitt on a scoring chance with this acrobatic interception.

“He [Stevens] is a tough player to

Bowman said. “Joe has done a very
good job on the left side. Yes, he has
played well since he’s come back. He’s

he’s getting better every game.”

Even though the Penguins ended up
with a tie, there seemed‘ to be little dis-

An inexperienced Pitt
men’s cross country
team finished a disap-
pointing 16th at the
IC4As on Saturday with
-both of its seniors out
with injuries.

The Panther lineup,
suffering from the loss
of senior Waddie
Freeman to knee trou-
bles earlier in the
week, was further
weakened when senior
Torn Swartout dropped
out of the race at the

back problems.

'“It was a ‘good race
for us considering that
we ran without our two
seniors who are two of
our ‘top scorers,” dis-
tance coach Jim Lear-
said. “We didn’t have
real strong runners in
the fourth and fifth
spots to make up for
the loss and that really
hurt us.” A ‘

Sophomore Frank
Nesko led all Pitt‘ run-
ners with a 55th place
finish, while runners
Mike Lynn and Mike

and 83rd respectively.

Nesko said that with-

strategies Pitt had
worked on in practice
were not very effective,

year kicker Ken Harnden
missed a 47-yard field goal
attempt and the score remained
7-0. '

On Louisville’s next posses.-

” sion, Harnden would be more
7 accurate. After two passes by

Brohrn, Harnden hit a.28-yard
field goal to widen the lead to
10-0 with 9:40 to go in the half.

With help from a facemask
penalty, the Panther offense
made two gutsy fourth-down
plays and drove to the Louisville
10-yardline. 4

Pitt’s luck ran out on its third

‘ fourth-down call when Van Pelt

threw ~ his second interception
on a pass into the end zone.
While killing its own drive,
Pitt got the ball right back when
linebacker Jason‘ Chavis forced a
fumble recovered by nose tack-
le Tom Bamdt. Putting the ball
on the Cardinal 20 with 1:20 to
play in the half, it took five
plays until Van Pelt snapped out
of his early daze and found
Dietrich Jells on a quick slant
route to cut the lead to 10-7.
Coming out after halftime, the

‘ Panther offense gained some

momentum. With runs by Curtis

Martin and a roughing-the-pass- ~

er penalty against Louisville, the
Panthers drove to the Cardinals’
six before their drive stalled.
Sean Conleys chip shot, 25-yard
ﬁeld goal tied the score, and the
momentum continued to shift.
“The key to the game was

coming out at halftime,”—Hackett '

said: “We moved the lengthlof
the ﬁeld and tied it at 10-10, but

our offense did some things that ‘

put our -defense behind the
eight ball.”

Forcing Louisville to punt on
its next possession, Pitt’s
offense, or rather Van Pelt, did
the “things” that
referred to. Three erroneous
passes turnedeinto three inter-
ceptions which turned into
three touchdowns. That ran the
Panther quarterback’s intercep-

tially ended the game. 4

sidering that the Dan Quinn contro-
versy hangs over the team — Lemieux
in particular.

“I waslhoping to see more distrac-
tion than what I saw,” Page "said. “He
[Lemieux] has some tough things
going on right now. But that team
came to play.” .

Page also displayed satisfaction by
his team’s performance against the
two-time Stanley Cup champions. “We
want to become the best team in the
league,” Page said. “We’re. working
hard at it and we’re learning from
everybody every night. Tonight. was
one of those tests.”

Several of the Penguins noted the
vast improvement in Quebec since
last year. -

“They were in the top of their divi-
sion for a while when they had the
Stastnys [Peter, Anton and Marian] and

1 when'Dale Hunter was in his prime,”

Ron Francis said. “Then they went
through some tough years but the
benefit of the tough years is obviously
the amount-of young talent they now

have. They’re young and they’re ,

learning and they’re pretty close.
When they learn to win on a consis-
tent basis they’re going to be danger-
'ous."’ ' .

Ex-Nordique a-nd current Penguin
defenseman Bryan Fogarty also saw a
noticeable difference in hisformer
team. '

“They” play with a lot of discipline,”
Fogartysaid. “It’s a big change from
last year. The guys, they’re really
gelling together with the [Lindrosl-
trade. I went through three years of
losing there and it’s good to see that
they’re having a good time and start-
ing to win again.” '

Penguin players expressed their sat-
isfaction with the team’s quick start,
but they also recognized the fact that
their play as of late has been
mediocre. ‘

“I think the team’s played pretty"

well so far at the beginning but the
past four or five games we maybe
haven’t played as strong aswe had
earlier in the year, but that’s to be
expected,” Penguin blue liner Paul
Stanton said.’ “We played a lot
of games and a lot of days on the

road.”

The next night back on the road in
Detroit the Penguins were embar-
rassed 8-0. The results of playing five
games in seven nights clearly showed
as the confused-looking_ Penguins
were. outplayed throughout the game.
Another factor that contributed to
Pittsburgh’s lackluster play was the
fact that Rick Tocchet, Stevens,iBob
Errey and Ulf Samuelsson did not
dress for the game. Pittsburgh suf-
fered another key loss when Lemieux
left the game late in the second peri-
od with a heel injury. »

Despite being tagged for six goals
in two periods of work, Barrasso
played a good game. With the
Penguins being outshot 22-4 in the
first, he allowed only two goals to
keep the game competitive. In the
second, though, the Pens fell apart
with Jimmy,Carson notching his sec-
ond and third goals of the game while
Steve Yzerman scored the 400th goal
of his career. Paul Ysebaert added a
shorthanded goal in that frame —— the
third shorthanded goal Pittsburgh has
allowed in the last week.

“Throwing the ball out of
bounds is like giving up to
Alex.” _

But by throwing one or
two of those passes out of
bounds, Van Pelt might not
have walked out of Pitt Stadium
at all. He might have run out
with a clear head, a "warm feel-
ing and a little applause from
the crowd.

Fans

Continued from page 9

in football this year, I would
have said 8-4 and a possible
bowl bid. This football pro-
gram is just falling apart. That
has showed this game more
than any other.”

This Pitt football season
seems to be hitting Pittsburgh
natives like Derreck
Burkhimer — especially hard.

“I followed Pitt since I was
a born,” Burkhimer said. “My

sentiment for this season is‘

plain disgust. The coaching
decisions are very question-
able, and the team just has
no heart.”

“This is one of the lowest

moments in Pitt sports histo-
ry,” said Rich Kushner, a Pitt
grad of 1982. “I’ve been a big
Pitt fan for over 20 years.
This Panther football team is
a travesty not only to Pitt
fans, but to the entire city of
Pittsburgh. Ifithis continues

much further, this program ’

will simply dissolve.”

The most angry man found
in the stands was Marty
Samuels, a sociology teacher
and Pitt booster since his
graduation from Pitt in 1962.

“This university is selling

p fraud,” Samuels said. “They

have been promising us _big-
time football now for years

and have failed on their
promise. We never won a
great deal of games in the

. ‘60s, but then theladministra—

tion never promised us we
would. They are downright
lying to us now. The Panther
teams in the ‘70s and ‘80s
were so successful that they
spoiled us. We had a taste of
success.

“If Pitt wants to compete

‘on a [lesser] Division I—A

level, fine. Just tell us! Don’t
tell us we’re going to play
big-time football only to field
a team and coaches that are
unable to compete on a big-
time level. It’s terribly -unfair

the losing effort.
' Pitt’s next opponent was host
team William & Mary, which
had already rolled over
Memphis State (5-3, 15-7, 15-2).
The Panthers took the open-
ing game 15-13 but dropped
the next two games, 15-10 and
15-12. They tied up the match

‘ .with an impressive 15-8 game-

four victory but went on to
drop the fifth and final game
by that same score of 15-8.

Lucanie and Mitchell’ led the
Panther attack in this match,
combining for 49 of Pitt’s 74
kills. On defense, Lucanie‘,
Mitchell, ' Mernagh and sopho-
more middle hitter Melanie
Gustafson all reached double
figures in digs.

The Panthers redeemed
themselves in their ﬁnal match
of the tournament, against
Memphis State. Pitt over-
whelmed the Lady Tigers in the

to the fans and the players
for the university to perpetu-
ate this lie any longer. It’s
time for the university of
Pittsburgh to tell the truth,”
Samuels said.

Pitt Athletic Director Oval
Jaynes would not respond to
these accusations after the
game but stated, “O_ur main
concern for this football team
right now is Saturday’s game
with Penn State.”

Mike O’Brien, who heads
the Golden Panthers, said he

did sympathize with the fans”

disappointment.
“We realize-the fans’ disap-
pointment with this season,

opening games of the match,

allowing them only 10 total"

points while taking the first two
games, 15-4 and 15-6. Memphis
St. came back to win game

three, 15-10, but the Panthers.

quickly recovered to take game
four (15-10) and the match,
three games to one.

"With Lucanie playing only
one game of this match, the
offensive firepower was evenly
distributed to much of the
team. Mitchell led with 11 kills,
followed by first-year player
Sarah Mikla with eight -and
Yanik’ with seven. On defense,

first-year player Laura. Horvath ‘

led the Panthers with 10 digs.
g From here, the Panthers
head into the

and we are disappointed and
frustrated this season too,”
O’Brien said. “But we
are hoping for things to
look up in the long run.
The key word here is
patience.”

Whether Pitt fails to contin-
ue to compete on a major

college level and slips into

the oblivion of Division I-A
or makes some changes
toward improving the football
p_rogram to show promise
into the future, nothing can
be‘ done to improve the
future of Pitt football this
week, except to beat Penn

-State.

said.“We planned to’
run as a pack and push

each other. We came
apart early in the race,

' and

obviously we
couldn’t finish strong
without two of our top
runners. I think- we
were distracted by the
fact that Waddie wasn’t
there.”

Big East

Lear said he was cer-
tain that if Swartout
would have finished
the race, he would
have been among the
top runners. Swartout
had complications with
his back in past sea-
sons, but this season
there had been no
problem,

“I think we all felt
some extrapressure
without Waddie being
there,” Swartout said.
“But there was no indi-.
cation that my back
would be a problem.
It’s been treated before,
but I had no idea it
would be a factor in
this race until I felt the
strain and tightness
while I ran.”

Two districts make
up the overall IC-4A
race, with the top three
finishers in each district
‘earning a berth at
Nationals. Pitt is a
member of District II,
which sent nationally-
ranked teams Villanova
and Georgetown to
Nationals along with
third-place finisher
-Navy. ‘ '

Although the team of
underclassmen gave
hope for future success
at Pitt as they held their
own by scoring in the
top half of a field of
the country’s strongest .
teams, Nesko believed
they could have been
more of a contender
this year.

“We lost a lot of
points, maybe 100 or
more, that we would’ve
had if everybody was
healthy,” Nesko said. .“I
think we_had a good
chance ‘of placing in-
the top 10.”

Election

Continued from page 1

“The New Yorle T ima put the Gennifer
Flowers story inside, in a very small
Associated Press blurb, and they
thought they did enough,” he said. “This
was not so because this year the print
tabloids had been joined by the televi-
sion tabloids who put the issue in the
public’s face.”

Walker attended Oxford University
with President-elect Bill Clinton, where
he graduated first in his class. The recip-
ient of a number of scholarships and
fellowships, he is also the first Western
correspondent to report regularly in
Moscow. - '

Walker said the three things he felt

changed the relationship between the
media and politics forever were Ross
Perot, the “1-800” phone number and a
book that Paul Tsongas wrote outlining
his domestic plans.

Walker said candidates in this year’s
campaign “went over our [media’sl
heads” to approach “the people.”

“There has been a whole series of
insurgencies going on of the candidates
and of the voters,” he said.

Three of those “insurgencies” Walker
deﬁned were the candidates’ ability to

better manipulate their images, the
“growing up” of the American public
and the replacement of the World War
II generation by the baby boomers.
‘Walker pointed to Bill Clinton’s
refusal be defined by traditional agenda
setters in the media, like The New York
Tima, The New Yorle Daily News and “6O
Minutes.” -
“In insisting on campaigning stead-
fastly like a rob_ocop who can take,

blows and never fall down, [Clinton] 7

proved that he does not have to be
manipulated by the media, but that he
can use it to his best advantage,” he
said. '

"Pointing to the second televised presi-

_ dential debate, Walker said, “You the

American public grew up.” Inparticular,
he referred to a man in his 40s" who
made a plea to -the press and candidates
“can’t we please stop this [mudslinging]
and focus on the issues?”

“This generation — the baby boom
generation —— has become the largest
single voting block in the United States,
and with it, they’ve brought unique
experiences that will forever change the
political mood of this country,” Walker
said.

Not only did the baby boom genera-
tion have a lasting impact on this cam-

paign, but so did Ross Perot, Walker

said. _

“I think Perot reallynailed down dif-
ferences between the old media and the
new media, because the new media
took over, which very much intimidated

A the old media; .but it liberated you the

voter.”

Walker characterized the “old media”
as_ institutions like NBC, CBS and ABC,
while the “new media” concentrates on
more sound bites, entertainment—orient—
ed news, like “MTV,” “SO-minutes with
Perot,” and the “1—800” phone numbers.

The final shift, Walker said, was that
ultimately the old media will have to
reinvent themselves.

“I predict you’re not going to see any-
more of the traditional press confer-
ences. Candidates and career politicians
don’t really need us when they can go
to a talk show or buy air time,” he said.
“So the question becomes, what is left
for us besides the op-ed pages?”

“We,” Walker said, identifying himself
as part of the old media, “won’t tell you
what the candidate did yesterday but
what he’ll do tomorrow.”

gram to me because I'm a big believer
in the community, and it’s important to
the kids,” Owens said.

Owens spends one hour a week
with the second-grade student she
tutors. During their time together, they

will go over his homework and she,

will help him with any subjects with
which he is having trouble.

Last year the program helped 225
students with their school work, but
tutors are in great demand.

“This year we have 140 kids and
there are 40 kids on a waiting list,”
Peters said. “We need more tutors.”

Pitt student Alan Martello has volun-
teered his time since the beginning of
this term.

“I wanted to give something back to
the community, and it’s rewarding
work,” Martello said.

ExtraOrdinary Tutoring has sessions
Monday through Thursday from 3:30
p.m. to 7:30 p.m. at the East Liberty
Presbyterian Church. Anyone interest-
ed in becomingla tutor can call 361-
5549. '

“It is critical that we get more tutors,
because this program depends on the
volunteers to help the kids do well at
school,” Peters said.
