graduates will pay an additional $50
each term, beginning in the fall.
The budget, passed at an annual
meeting held at Pitt’s regional
campus here, assumes state
funding of $61.9 million, the
amount recommended in Gov-‘
Shapp’s state budget. A proposal
passed by the Senate, however,

would grant Pitt only $60.5 million, -

the amount Pitt: received a year ago.

Trustee Ruggero Aldisert (left) told his colleagues the state was “welching on
promises made Pitt in the sixties,” then voted in vain against tuition hikes of

approximately 10 percent Tuesday.

An air of despair and
frustration pervaded classrooms in

nouncement of $1,000 per year
medical school tuition hike.

This is the second consecutive
year medical school tuition has been
hiked $1 .000, rising from $1 ,500 per
year for Pennsylvania residents in
1974 to next year's proposed
$4,000.

One student, who said he wishes
to remain anonymous to avoid being
labled “unprofessional” by the
school's faculty. typiﬁed student
concern at the University's hospital-
medical school complex.

“The whole problem here is a
matter of misshapen priorities,”
the third year student said, “and

the powerless ones, the students, .

are the ones who suffer.”

‘‘In a way, you pay for yourself,
especially during the third and
fourth year, by working for the

don't know why student tuition
should support them so much.
“I'd like to know exactly where

While undergraduates may mild-
ly protest‘ their hike. this student
expects silence from his colleagues.
“There’ll be no protest here,” he

' said. “No one wants to be accused

of unprofessional behavior by a
professor.” ,

This student was accepted to five
medical schools but chose Pitt
because, ‘ ‘it was a bargain at $1 ,500
per year compared to the other
schools.”

‘ ‘Maybe it still is a bargain, but if
I was an out-of-state student, I'd be
discouraged from coming to Pitt,”
he said.

Should that bill be enacted, further
cutbacks and tuition increases
could follow. 5 ,

Tuition will rise in all schools
should the conditional budget be
used, with most students shoulder-
ing an eight percent to 12 percent
increase.” Medical school tuition,
however, rose by $1,000 for the
second consecutive year, making
in-state tuition $4,000 and out-of-
state tuition $6,000. ”.

Dentalstudents face the next-
biggest increase: in-state tuition
will rise $600, to $3,100 yearly and
out-of-state rates will increase
$1,000, to $5,500.

Also included in the budget
passed by the Trustees is a $3.5
million reduction in physical plant
and general operating costs, or
cutbacks. _

‘ Chancellor Wesley Posvar, in a
statement released prior to the
Trustees’ vote, expressed regret
concerning the increases in tuition.
‘ ‘We have repeatedly petitioned our
state officials to provide adequate
funding to prevent this -increase.
But once again we have been forced
to pass part of our increased costs
on to the students,” he said. _

Posvar.was forceful at times in his
criticism of Pennsylvania’s “stated

policy of maintaining high tuition._’ ’

More pointed was the dissent of
Trustee Ruggero Aldisert, a U.S.
Third Circuit Court of Appeals
judge and a Pitt graduate.

Aldiserte said the state was
“welching on promises made Pitt in
the sixties and forcing a public
policy that has caused tuition here
to rise 100 percent in four years,”
then joined student Trustee Sheila
W. Rathke and Governor-appointed
Trustee Al Lawson in voting against
the proposed budget.

It was the second consecutive

’ year the trio had been the lone

dissenters.

Rathke, a School of General
Studies student appointed. to the
Board by Shapp, said large

numbers of upperclassmen had,

been forced to leave school by
recent’ tuition hikes. “We’re

The Commission was set up to

Act 195 establishes the rights of

Lawson cited a report indicating
Pitt, with the proposed budget, will

high as the national average.

Lawson urged the‘ University to

consider “thinking in terms of ,

= Posvar maintained students and
academics were accorded a high

and warned further cutbacks would
adversely affect the University.
“We’ve squeezed things as dry as
we can,” he said.’

The PPU is an organization
seeking collective bargaining rights
for faculty at Pitt. its branch
organization, the Union of Graduate
Employes (UGE) is striving for
collective bargaining rights for
graduate ‘employes.

Novotny explained that in 1974,
when the PPU ﬁled a petition with
the Pennsylvania Labor Relations
Board (PLRB) for a graduate
employe union representation elec-
tion, the PLRB found them to be Pitt
employes. The PLRB’s petition was

“As a result of the negative
decision by the PLRB...Pitt grad-

uate employes find themselves in a p

precarious position: we are ‘em-

ployes, but it isunclear whether we ~

fall under Act 195," Novotny said.
"Since the legal pmcedures‘of Act
195 ‘have’ been denied us, the only
way i we can win collectively
bargaining is —through direct
confrontation with the University of
Pittsburgh administration.”

Posvar also said enrollment of

policy set by the state. The lion’s

Before passing the budget, the
Trustees deliberated a proposal to
make clear the University’s position
concerning disclosure of informa-
tion pertaining to faculty review.
The University position, which is
that faculty should not be required
to disclose such proceedings, even
in court, was not added to
University by-laws, but Aldisert
promised to work on a proposal “to
extend to faculty the same
protection extended Trustees and
other officers” of the University.

Maintenance

  Cutbacks
Anticipated

By J OANN KOWALSKI

If an anticipated funding cutback
in maintenance occurs, Pitt’s
custodial staff will have to service
more facilities without additional
manpower, custodial supervisor
John Shamlin said.

“The staff depends on the state
for a good portion of its funds, and
when the funds are cut, the staff is
cut,” Shamlin said recently. “Andl
anticipate a cut in our budget.”

The cutback will affect 261
custodians currently employed by
Pitt. Shamlin said this may be the
largest staff on campus.

Because the staff is governed by
Local 29 of the Building Service
Employes Union, no cut in pay can
be authorized to counteract loss of
funds. ‘

“We have not lost any employes
because of budgetary restrictions in
the past,” Shamlin also said,
adding he expects no layoffs to
occur as a result of this year’s

A budget”. 4

Schenley Hall maintenance sup-
ervisor Joe Lesko said the cutback
will mean a lot more work for the
custodians.’ ’

“They will have to take men out
of different buildings to maintain
the facilities,” Lesko said.

The completion of the Profes-
sional Quadrangle and the School of
Nursing will bring‘ the number U1
academic . buildings serviced by
maintenance to 40.

‘When asked if he is dissatisﬁed
with the cutback in state appropria-
tions, Lesko said. “Since no
additional help will be hired that’s
the way it’s going to have to be.”

Shamlin added, “Things may not
be as you and I would like them after
custodial services are slashed.”

of graduate student government, to
sponsor a mock election.

“Despite attempts to undermine
the election, we went to the polls on
March 23 and 24 and ‘ voted
overwhelmingly for unionization, ”
Novotny stated. Graduate em-
ployes also voted overwhelmingly
for UGE as the collective bargaining
agent.

“The University of Pittsburgh
administration,” Novo y said,
“has to deal responsibly with the
results of this collective bargaining
election. In short, Chancellor
Posvar refuses to be morally bound
by these election results.

“The only way to get Chancellor

Posvar to deal with us seriously is to W

build a strong union, capable of
carrying out a successful strike,”
Novotny said.

Pitt political science professor
John Chapman also offered testi-
mony to the commission.

‘‘I appear before you to
recommend exemption "of the
Commonwealth’s state-related uni-
versities from the provisions of Act
l95,” Chapman said. “I speak as

“The quality of the university
depends on tenure appointments

done in our major public and private

practice and affords its faculty

said.

“The unions also oppose limita-

by Pitt’s 1974 Tenure Commission

He also charged Pitt students are

between great public and private

“This means that we are sending

‘'7! Years of Collegiate Journalism at the University of Pittsburgh”

Time to Punt?

For the third straight year, the bottom line of fall invoices will
thf0W students one more financial step backward. For some, that
step will be their .last at Pitt; for most others, it will be one more
painful plunge into debt or study time now spent working.

One-hundred dollars isn’t much, except it’s $100 added to two
other increases to already high tuition in the past few years. Pitt’s
tuition will now be double the national average for similar schools,
in almost all cases. And cutbacks will make the University even less
attractive to high school seniors. It’s little wonder one vice chan-
cellor calls the combination “tcannibalization. ” ‘

But it’s equally apparent Trustees had little choice at Greensburg
Tuesday. An appallingstate policy‘ forced passage of the budget
\proposed by Pitt’s senior staff. ‘ And, it forced. three
Trustees—Sheila Rathke, Ruggero Aldisert and Al Lawson—to
vote against the budget, inprotest. To this trio, each student owes
thanks, at least.

No blame lies at the Cathedral or in the corporate boardroorns
from which many Trustees come.‘ No, the culprit in this case is
Harrisburg, the state capital. . 4,

It was a sparse appropriation recommended by Gov. Shapp, who
is gaining quite a reputation in financial circles. His proposal of

P $61.9 millionin state funding was the root of the tuition increase

and cutbacks. , T

But that wasnm’t enough, according to our state Senators. They,
unbelievably, pﬁsed Bill 771, which pared a badly needly $1.4
million from the Governor’s proposed allocation, leaving the
House to debate at month’s enda budget that includes allocation,
leaving the House to debate at month’s end abudget that includes
only $60.5 million for Pitt. If that is passed, it’s back to the
tuition-and-cutback well for Joe Dutton, Jack Freeman and staff.

If the University does need to draw on those already strained
resources, it should consider cutbacks before tuition. One tuition
increase each 12 months is more than enough.

This is not attractive to us, but neither is state policy. It is in-
creasingly apparent that Pitt must take a long look at
programs——even de\partments—that have a chronic case of red ink.

The majority of students may no longer be able to support those?
Pitt can’t offer

few who benefit from such programs.
’ everything—whatever happened to business and journalism—and
may not be able to continue its current curriculum.

‘This is not an endorsement of retrenchment. Pitt should con-
tiiiue to strive for excellence in those departments where, for Pitt, it
isfattainable. ’

§;But, especially this year, cutbacks in little—used or waste areas are
leiis harmful than another tuition increase. It's a hard stand to
take——and one that shouldn’t be necessary——but it is, thanks to
Harrisburg. ,

This may be a job for Johnny Majors: or, a the least, Larry
Swider.  J A C

T A Fair Offer

We suspect it was not what either side desired, but Chancellor

if Posvar’s 15-month offer to Paul Nyden is a fair and, under the

year-long circumstances, welcome proposal. -
It appears to extend Nyden an equitable course to .p.OSSlbl€
renewal, while at the same time offering him no undueprivileges.

‘_We had doubted the usefulness of "any term shorter than three

years, but the spelled-outprocedures contained in Posvar’s letter to
the assistant sociology professor make this alternative acceptable.
Any agreement, however, is only as good as theintentions os
those involved. We’d like to think Posvar seeks to give Nyden a
fair shake, and his recent remarks and actions lead us toward this
‘belief. \ ,
On Nyden’s part, he says‘ he is confident he can prove his
scholarly worth, and that is a good sign of spirit on his part. Now,

5 if his colleagues in the sociology department will attempt toput

profession over animosity, a sane end to the Nydenvs. Pitt case
might be possible.

On April 29. 1977 the University
Senate Hearing Board unanimously
recommended that Dr. ‘Paul Nyden
of the department of sociology be
reappointed as an assistant profes-
sor. On May 12, 1977 Chancellor
Posvar made Dr. Nyden an
unorthodox offer for reappointment

as assistant professor of sociology.

for a 15 month term, with his being
administratively and physically
removed from the sociology for a -15
month term, with his being
administratively and physically
removed from the sociology de-
partment and being placed under
the direct supervision of Faculty of
Arts and Sciences Dean Jerome
Rosenberg (who was a “de-
fendant" in the case before the
Hearing Board). This offer
specifies that Dr. Nyden need he
give only two months notice before
termination if this proposed 15
month contract is not to be
renewed. .
This offer to Dr. Nyden violates
paragraph seven of the “Appoint-
ments and Tenure” section of the
Faculty Handbook. It also violates
the customary practice at this
university and the standards of the
American Association of University
Professors ‘
Furthermore. removing Dr. Ny-
den from the department of
sociology is highly irregular.
No rhetoric concerning, "collegial-
ity" can overcome the actuality of
noncollcgiality on the Chancellor's
part and on the part of certain
senior faculty members in the

‘sociology department who wish to

exclude Dr. Nyden from their

We call upon Chancellor Posvar

to offer Dr. Nyden the customary C

three year contract. Furthermore,

Who Wronged
Sharon Johnson?

As a graduate of the University
of Pittsburgh (philosophy, B.A.,‘
1961), as a taxpayer of this
conimonwealth, ,as _a native of
Pittsburgh, as the wife of an
educator and as the mother of two
daughters, I cannot express too
Stmngly my disgust and outrage at
the conduct of the University of
Pittsburghzin the civil rights suit of
Drofessor Sharori Johnson.

’ Pitt has spent well over $1
million ﬁghting this case. The
Auditor General of Pennsylvania
has said that the court costs have
been paid out of the general tuition
fund, two thirds of which is public
vmoney——That’s my money and that
of every person in the common-
wealth! Pitt, in the meantime. has
consistently refused to disclose
where it is obtaining money for
legal fees.

Coincidentally. Pitt's, medical
school is in the red to the tune of
about $1 million and is in danger of
losing accreditation! _ Is this sound
lﬁnancial management?

To members of the Pennsylvania
General Assembly who are charged
with protecting the’ public's in-
terests and its money: I demand
you withhold ‘appropriation of
public money to the,U‘niversity of
Pittsburgh -until it 1) gives a full
accounting of its expenditures in
this case. 2) settles with Dr.
Johnson and ceases its immoral
defense of this case and 3) returns
to the commonwealth the money
niisappropriated for this defense
during the past five years.

To the trustees who are charged
with the general welfare of the
University of Pittsburgh: I advise
that you ' fulfill your fiduciary
responsibilities by being better
informed of its dealings and in
this case. by recommending that
the relevant agents cease this
defense and settle with Dr,
Johnson. '

Nuclear Power Is Safe Power

So ’ole Jimmy Carter has
killed the breeder reactor. As a
biology major planning on ajcareer
in the environmental area you’d
expect me to be jumping for joy.
Well, I’m not jumping’. not smiling
and not rejoicing.

A “I thought that was supposed to
please all the environmentlists”
you might ask? Let me ask you
something, “Who are these en-
vironmentalists who have been
ﬁghting nuclear power all these
years?” I know who they are not.

They are almost never professional
environmental scientists. The
great majority of environmental

biologists. chemists and engineers .

have never been against nuclear
power. Granted, they have been in
favor of strict enforcement of
existing nuclear regulation laws,
and often in favor of strict
enforcement of existing nuclear
regulation laws, and often in favor

of certain additional laws.
However, they have never been for

the actual abolition of either
nuclear power or its expansion.

The reason is simple. Everyday
they work againstthe environ-
mental ravagesof fossil fuel energy
production. They are practical men
who realize the hard scientiﬁc
reality that solar energy as .a means
of mass production of electricity
may not be ready at any
competitive economic level for S0 to
100 years.

As the sulfur dioxide, carbon
monoxide and particulate matter
keeps pouring out of fossil fuel
smoke stacks, they worry. As the
strip mining rapes more wilderness
away. they Worry-_ So they look at
nuclear power and what do they
see? They see the nuclear power
plants releasing no more than five
milliroentgens (MR) of radioactive
material into the environment
yearly.

How small is SmR? If you lived
in Colorado instead of Pittsburgh
you would get another l00mR
exposure a year. due to Colorado's

higher natural background radia-
tion. Even in Pittsburgh, if you live
in a brick house instead of a
wooden house. or a stone house
instead of a brick one, you get an
extra 30 to 40 mR exposure per
year.

Then who are these “environ-
mentalists” against nuclear pow-
er? I They are almost invariably
people of no scientific background,
who quote antinuclear books
written by popular authors of
similar nonscientiﬁc backgrounds.

Perhaps when the last of their
friends die of lung cancer or
emphysema from coal-oil air
pollution. and when the last stream
in America is dead from acid mine
drainage, they will say “Oh no,
what have we Clone?” However,
they needn’t rejoice in their
ignorance, because Carter only
axed the plutonium breeder. He
has big plans ‘for the .thorium
breeder which produces the much
safer but very ﬁssionable uranium
233.

r ‘ N

\ _j

I guess I cane’—t-stop till I briefly

mention the tiny antinuclear rally a

few weeks ago in Pittsburgh. Since

it was cosponsored by the “Friends
of the Earth” organization. I can't
help but think what a shame it is
that the earth can’t speak for itself.

I can almost hear it mumbling the‘
old expression, “With friends like
these, who needs enemies?”

In Self -Hypnosis

By RICH HARRY

Modern day hypnosis, with a
history stretching back to ancient
iGreece and Egypt where it was
practiced for its healing properties,
has been customarily linked with
professional stage entertainment.
No matter what the setting—from
elaborate stage presentations in
Vegas to modest hot plate ban-
quests in Peoria-—most people view

_ thehynotist as an arcane, cloaked

ﬁgure who indulges in the black arts
when he’s not facing an audience.

But Amos Selavan may be
changing that image, at least for
those who go to the Oakland
hypnotist_ for professional training
in self-hypnosis and its use in
clinical psychology.

‘ The stage may never be set for
Selavan--in fact, he’s against the
idea—but he has a more construc-
tive purpose for self-hypnosis.

‘ ‘Hypnosis is a good way to get on
with life” and an effective way to
surmount personal problems, says
Selavan, who holds advanced
degrees in clinical psychology from
the University of Chicago and
Duquesne and who is a member of
the American Society of Clinical
Hypnosis. A

Hynosis, to Selavan, is “a state of
mind” that can be used “for doing

— something a part of us says we are

notable to do.”

He stresses self-assertiveness to
his clientele. “Hypnosis, I believe,
is a decision-making process. We
live by decision whether we are
aware of it or not, we must decide
what we need to do.”

Selavan instructs. his students
with a self-hypnotic process which

tions have not drawn too much
attention at Pitt, and the reason may
be that similar situations have
existed since the late ’60s when
coed living was a college fad. '

Presently, at least 25 women are
living in’ Pitt fraternity houses
through the Oakland and Shadyside
area.

Most of the girls are currently
attending school and many of them
also have part-time jobs.

While no particular type domi-

nates fraternity living, many of the _

girls are nurses. In addition, of the
10 girls interviewed, all are
members of sororities, and most
said they were already acquainted
with the men with whom they share
the house.

Why are the fraternity houses so
popular with women? .\

“It’s convenient and much less
expensive than any other housing in
the area,” said Kris Juleus, ‘ a
sophomore nursing student and
member of Alpha Delta Pi sorority,
who is living at the Alpha Epsilson
Pi fraternity house on Dithridgé

Street with three other girls.

Not only are these living
accomodations attractive to women,
but they are also popular with
independent men. The boarder
usually has access to all house
facilities in addition to her room,
rented at $50-$75 per month.

The situation is beniﬁcial to both

male and female. The fraternity
nets added income’ while the
boarder enjoys convenient and
inexpensive place to live.
V One would . think that women
might experience certain problems
in this type of living situation, but so
far none have been reported.

“Most of the guys are accus-
tomed to having us around,” said
Juleus, “and they are pretty good
about the whole thing.”

A‘ ‘I haven’t had any problems as of
yet,” she added, ‘ ‘and the only time
I get nervous is when I go to take a
shower in the morning.”

So life at the Pitt fraternity house
proceeds as normal-——well, almost
normal——during the summer, and
will probably continue that way-
safely and profitably for everyone.

starts with relaxation of the mind
and body (usually while the person
is in a horizontal position) and leads
into what he terms a ‘ ‘fantasy trip. ’ ’

“A person is invited to imagine a
setting in which he feels com-
fortable—like an ocean or ‘a
forest——a place where he feels‘ he
can be himself without feeling he
must be protected. Sometimes
under hypnosis a person feels
vulnerable to outside forces and
makes himself scared,” Selavan
says. 

In the ﬁnal stage of the self-hyp-

_notic technique, Selavan says, the.

person attempts to convince himself’
through internal dialogue that he
has the power to achieve what he
desires—to quit smoking, to lose
weight, to succeed in school, or to
confront the boss, for example.
“Every day I face an issue that
will determine whether today will
be a ‘winday’ or a ‘lose day,”
Selavan says. “Hypnosis facilitates
getting a ‘win day’ for me.”
Selavan compares the self-
hypnotic process to “taking an
acid trip without taking the drug”
and he often plays music during his
sessions to evoke a certain mood.
“A person who took an acid trip
before may have a similar sensation
during the fantasy trip,” he says.
Almost anyone V is capable of
self-hypnosis, according to Selavan,
who has personally used the
technique for the past eight years.
“Unless hezis a very small child,
mentally defective or psychotic,
anyone can be self-hypnotized,” he
says. “Some people are more ready
for it than others because it involves
a learning process.”
“Basically, hypnosis is a very
simple technique,” Selavan con-

tinues. “It is similar to walking.

Walking is physiologically complex
but the actual process of placing one
foot before the other is very
simple.” »

And self-hypnosis is not dan-
gerous, he says, discounting
popular beliefs‘ to the contrary.
“People may think it is, but
self-hypnosis is a voluntary act; a
person can open his eyes at any
moment and be in full control.”

Selavan’ also points out that

“Cheap Trick” Is Zoo Rock

By M. PATRTCK MONAHAN

After looking at the front and
back covers of Cheap Trick’s debut‘
album, ‘ ‘Cheap Trick, ’ ’ it suffices to
say these four guys would be
comfortable in a zoo or insane
asylum as they are grinding out
punk-rock.

What an odd looking band! The
drummer, according to liner notes

‘ (which are known to stretch the
, truth), is from Venezuela and the
‘son of a South American industrial-

ist whose family was instrumental
in building the Panama Canal. His
name is Bun E. Carlos, short for
Bunezeula, and looks like a cross
between Teddy Roosevelt and the
Goodyear blimp. .

songwriter, Rick Nielson, does-

A Nielson and bassist Toin Peters-
son, who by the way is cut from the
British rock-star mold, supposedly

got the band together on the French ’
Riveria ‘ ‘amidst a warm climate and

nubile, tanned, young female-
oociies.”

With ‘liner notes like these and
their hard-hitting music, Cheap
Trick is trying to create an
of-the-wall image and cash in on the
punk-rock boom.

Most punk-rock stinks. The
musicians cannot play and they
wear the mangiest clothes so they
can act like the dead-end kids. Big
deal. Listening to crap music

title suggests. Cheap Trick wants

as much as they can get and the

place doesn’t make much differ-
ence.

“Taxman, Mr. Thief,” sticks it to
good old Uncle Sam, and who can
disagree with the lyrics? “Youi
work hard» for your money/ but the
taxman’s out to get you/it’s just not
fair.”

“He’s a Whore,” hammers on
male prostitution (these guys aren’t
afraid of the grisly stuff) with lines
like, “I’ll do anything for money.”

Nielsen was called by Douglas the

.. “best songwriter he ever worked

Not so with Cheap Trick.
Theirs is one of the year’s best hard
rockalbums. Enlisting the services
of Aerosmith’s ace-metal producer
Jack Douglas, the band’s sound is

' crisp, clean and bold.

Cheap Trick ties to tell us what is
wrong with the world. What is
brightening is that the lyrics.

- juvenile but to the point, actually

make sense.

“Hot Love” is exactly what the

with.” Though Nielsen plays
mostly chords, they’re melodic and
hauntingly powerful. "

Vocalist Robin Zander is pretty
enough to be a centerfold for
Playgirl, but the man doesn’t do it
allvon looks. His voice ﬁlled with
emotion sounds like John Lennon at
his most irate, “give peace a chance
days.” .

His vocals on “Mandochello”
and Terry Reid's “Speak Now or
Forever Hold Your Peace” are
particularly noteworthy for ‘his
ability to «switch from icy “control to
raging screams. T

Peterson and Carlos are a simple
rhythm section, but they’ve got the
weird looks that could help Cheap
Trick make ‘it in a ﬁeld filled with
groups looking for a gimmick and a
quick ride to the too.

I ‘Cheap Trick plays good, hard

rock ’n’ roll and takes the old *

parental line» one step further:
"you wouldn’t want your daughter
to look at a cheap trickster, let alone
marry one.”

If zoo-rock comes back, we all
know who the rich animals will be.

Though the show has been
criticized for its ﬂimsy story, there
is enough decent music and buildup
of characters to make it interesting.
“You know the people (onstage).
They make you laugh, they make-
you cry,” said Dale Soules, who
plays Cal, in reference to a story.

The play"s story involves Joe, a
young, easy-going magician at-i
tempting to start a successful career
by subbing at a nightclub in
Passaic, NJ. In his shadow is

unnoticed, sharp-tongued Cal from
New York’s West End Avenue,

whose dream is to be a lion tamer.

Joe’s potential problems -rest in
Feldman, a boring, old-fashioned
top hat, rabbit-pulling magician
who is out to undermine Joe’s act

More Hype Under

Shrine ’s Big Top  .

By MREA CSORBA

The Shrine Circus pulled into
town Tuesday, bringing with it all
the hype of circus tradition.

Their lions were reportedly from
the deepest depths of the African
jungle. Their baboon-training
princess, appropriately wigged and
made-up, just got off the boat. And
the troupe’s trapeze act has been
”many times imitated, but never
equalled.” Of course.

Some acts were good. . The
“Flying Valentines” trapeze feats
were punctuated with audience
gasps. The performance of
Pennsylvania’s star baton twirler,
who ended her act juggling three
ﬂaming batons, showed she mer-
ited her title.

The Farrel couple’s “helicopter
spin,” which spun a woman by a
loop around her neck 70 feet above
the crowd, was made even more
dramatic through good use ‘of
lighting. And’ the Lipizzan
stallions were very well-trained.

But these acts were too sparsely

. spaced within the three-hour show.

For the rest of the evening, the
audience received ﬁller-material.
“Comic relief” they call it in show
‘business, but in this instance the
punch lines were missing.

A ﬁve-minute banter with the
ringmaster ended with a mild
twittering response from the
audience. The best the costumed
jokers could do was rely on the
surprise element in their routine:
on their duck-hunting expedition,
the third and punch-line_time they
shot a duck from_the sky, it was
dressed and ready for duck soup.

But the hype continued. By the
middle of the show, a death-defying
leap was transformed into a lion
jumping from two low platforms.

The clown troupe’s largest
showing came\ at intermission.
While some of the audience

recessed with cotton candy, those I

remaining in their seats were
subjected to a billboard and poster
parade crediting the Shrine Circus
advertisers. " "

But to give due credit to the

ringmaster, Earl Michaels did an _

admirable job maintaing the stuffed
front of the Shrine Circus.

Do/es Anybody Give it Damn?
By Nat Hentoff
Alfred A. Knopf

Although he’s primarily known as
a jazz writer‘ and reviewer for
“Cosmopolitan,” Nat Hentoff is no
stranger to the ﬁeld of education. In
the ’60s, he wrote a book on the
deplorable state of public schools
called “Our Children Are Dying.”

The illusions no doubt carry the
show. 0ne’s doubts about
Henning’s magic on television are
destroyed when seen live.

Participants in these illusions feel
the. brunt of the magic. “Pm
obviously not cut into four pieces,”
said‘ Soules, ‘an actress from the
fmglnal cast. Inorder to create the
musldhv though. it IS painful and
dangerous. ’ ’

Like all other Broadway shows,
“_The Magic Show” is perfromed
eight times a week and will play as
long as the show makes money.
Though lead magician Joseph
Abaldo has been in the company for
six months he stated, “I’m not
bored at all. Each night there’s a
different audience. They’re seeing
the show for the ﬁrst time.”

Acknowledging the warm re-
sponse the show, now ﬁnishing its
third year, received, he said, “It’s a
lovely relationship between the

, « - - . a

logical sequel to the original work.

Hentoff talks with several people
who were the focus of his. earlier
book. Unfortunately, little has
changed in over a decade.

In one of the more chilling
chapters, Hentoff talks to parents,
students and teachers on the
subject of corporal punishment.
Entitled “Does Eric Sevareid’s Kid

abuse teachers and principals

‘inflict on children of grade school

Shaw was 30th in her senior class of

school yearbook. ' ‘

recalled, “I would have preferred to
play basketball, but my high school
coaches thought I had more
potential in track.”

Shaw soon found that women’s V

scholastic and collegiate track and '

“Prior to coming here, I had no
long-jump form whatsoever,” she
confessed. “I mean, I’d just run .

“I enjoy making people laugh, but

inost of his life, quickly caught on

.with WTAE’s large audience. The
shows were expanded to evening

drive-time slots and were then
taped at the station’s studios in
Wilkinsburg. Soon, Cope ‘was a
full~time broadcaster who had little
time for writing, so resigned his
post at Sports Illustrated. 

Guests of Cope’s unrehearsed
talk show are handled by Cope
personally, although this is the
producer's job at other stations.-

“I like my guests to show up
about 10 minutes to seven (the
hour-long show begins at 7 p.m. on
weekends).” Cope stated, “be-
cause if you sit around talking about
what you’re gonna discuss on the
show, the second time it’s said
there's no enthusiasm for it.
Consequently, everything that
happens on the talk show is
spontaneous, and therefore there
are surprises.”

Cope rarely uses his delay button
to cut off callers. p

H nen I was ﬁrst asked to do the
show, I didn’t want to do it because I
pictuxcd a lot of nuts coming out of

the wobdwork, which was the sort of
fare that I_had heard on most talk
shows,” he claimed. “But I said
‘Okay, I’ll do it. But I'm going to do
the thing according to my own
liking.’ My upbringing taught me
the value of manners and I treat mv

callers civilly. Itry to talk up to the
people and that, combined with
decent manners, gives you a better
grade of» callers. It's your callers
that make your show, not you.”

Of course, the voice and aura

autonomous body functions, includ-
ing respiration and heartbeat, can
be controlled through self-hypnosis
—-successfully, too, as suggested by
some of the cases he cites.

“A famous doctor once gave his
cancer patient medicine only to
appease the medical society,” he
relates. “But then the doctor
invited the patient to fantasize the
disease as an actual enemy and to
concentrate all the’ poewrs of the
body on ﬁghting the cancer. The

person, as a result of hypnosis,

became better.”

In addition to cancer treatment,
Selavan maintains that before-
undergoing dental work, a personl
can hypnotize himself to control

pain .without the traditional novo.
caine.

“Self-hynosis is self assertive-
ness,’.’ he streeses again. “Studies
show that 90 percent of all pain" is
derived psychologically. Only 10
percent is physical.”
