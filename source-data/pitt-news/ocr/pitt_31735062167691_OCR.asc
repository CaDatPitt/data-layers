Revolutionary Party

CRAP Stages Protest

by DON MARBURY
News Editor

There is a group of minority
students on campus. tremendouly
angered over what they term. “the
inadequacy of the administration
to recognize them as a functional
part of the University and urban

1 community."

The group, which affectionate-
ly calls itself the Crippled Revol-
utionary Action Party (CRAP),
staged a small demonstration last
Friday in front of the University’s
Public Health Building, protesting
the University’s policies and
treatment of wheelchair and other
handicapped students.

David Weir. graduate student
and spokesman for the group. said
that six wheelchair students and
their walkers went down to the
Public Health Auditorium Friday
afternoon. after finding out that
some sort of meeting was taking
place there.

"We put chains on the doors at
the entrance of the auditorium."
Weir said. "and handed out state-
ments. asking anyone who wanted
to get into the auditorium to please
use the entrance on Bouquet St..
which has been designated as the
handicap students‘ entrance."

Doomstluy Symposimn

He commented that the Bouquet
St. entrance is also the entrance
used ‘to take out garbage and that
in going through this entrance,
students had to pass through an
area where the bodies of animals
used in experimentation were
burned.

Weir said that campus police-
men were soon called to the scene
of the demonstration and proceed-
ed cut the chains. but that the
demonstration still went on.

Signs referring to the Chancel-
lor‘s recent drive for Urban Rele-
vancy were in evidence at the
demonstration, according to Weir.
One sign held by a wheelchair stu-
dent proclaimed the words “We
Too Are Urban Relevant.“ while
another bore the words: “Dr. Pos-
var Has Refused to Discuss Crips
on Campus."

Weir outlined a few of the com-
plaints of the group saying, “any
classroom on the second floor of
the Cathedral, stacks in the Hill-
man library, any rooms in the
School of Engineering building,
are all inaccessable to wheelchair
students.”

He also commented that the stu-
dents only had one real entrance
to the Cathedral. and even that
one was not completely wide

find out how many people were in
favor of John Lindsay for mayor.
But their experiences and impres-
sions. according to two Universi-
ty volunteers. included more than
just finding out how voters would
cast their ballots.

Casey Schulberg and Debby
Shapiro had separate telephone
conversations with The Pitt News,
and they had not previously spok-
en to each other about the cam-
paign. yet both unknowingly
agreed on several impressions.
One of these was the type of recep-

tion people offered when the can-
vassers knocked at doors. "It was
an indication of a state of mind."
remarked Casey. “If they opened
the door to let us in. they were us-
ually Lindsay people. If they didn't
open the door. or were rude. they
usually didn’t support him."
Debby’s opinion paralleled this
one, and she added a point that Ca-
sey had also brought up. “In the
black areas, we were very warm-
ly received. The upper-middle
class sections, even though some
people were not in favor of Lind-

Why Are
You A g
Poor Talker?

A noted publisher in Chicago
reports a simple technique of
everyday conversation which
can pay you real dividends in
social and business advance-
ment and works like magic to
give you poise, self-confidence
and greater popularity.

According to this publisher,
many people do not realize how
much they could influence oth-
ers simply by what they say and
how they say it.‘ Whether in
business, at social functions, or
even in casual conversations
with new acquaintances there
are ways to make a good im-
pression every time you talk.

To acquaint the readers of
this paper with the easy-to-foL
low rules for developing skill in
everyday conversation. the pub-
lishers have printed full details
of their interesting self-training
method in a new booklet, “Ad-
ventures in Conversation,”
which will be mailed free to any-
one who requests it. No obliga-
tion. Send your name, address,
and zip code to: Conversation,

card will do.

, Lindsay Campaign"-

(‘Continued from Page 2)

"Se just couldn‘t understand.
said Debby. “that we had every
right to be there. and that it was
her right to refuse to answer us. A
lot of people had similar reac-
tions. One girl literally had a door
slammed on her nose. When you
knocked on a door, you never knew
whether or not someone would
start punching.‘ People were in-
credibly rude."

“Nothing makes you as cynical
as canvassing,” Casey admitted.
“You come in contact with the ‘si-
lent majority.’ There are a lot of
closed-minded people who are not
even interested enough to openthe
door. It’s.not like the University
where people will ‘listen, even if
they don’t agree with you.”

Debby noted that Marchi and
Prococcino were making the
“same bid as Nixon. They appeal-
ed to what Nixon calls the forgot-
ten middle class majority, who

are not willing to become a part

of the ruling majority." Consider-
ing that Lindsay won the election.
added Debby. "they are not in the
majority of it's measured in
votes."

The volunteers‘ experience ran
to the political. as well as the per-
sonal. During the four-day stay.
Debby “realized that there are a
lot of people doing a. lot of work
behind the scenes." She agreed to
Casey's comment that the Lind-
say campaign employed the same
tactics as the Eugene McCarthy
movement. Casey claimed that
"it seems now that whenever a
major liberal candidate cam-
paigns. the same well—trained la-
bor force is brought in from other
areas to help. Polling is becom-
ing a skill.”

Now that Lindsay is in office,
Casey said that he likes to think
that he and the other volunteers
helped. “I would have been horri-
fied if Prococcino won.

A t Press Conference

Morse Lambasts War

by BILL GORMLEY
Feature Editor

Wayne Morse’s passion for fiery
rhetoric has not ebbed since he
left the United States Senate a
year ago. With characteristic gus-
to. the flamboyant ex-professor
responded to questions posed by
local gentlemen of the press on
Monday. The outspoken Oregon-
ian, one of_ the earliest critics of
U.S. involvement in Vietnam, de-
nounced President Nixon’s Viet-
r_1_am policy and wholeheartedly en-
dorsed the anti-war moratorium
movement during the course of
his comments.

“What we need is to hear the
tramp-tramp-tramp of marching
feet across this country in pro-
test against this immoral, illegal,
unjustifiable war." the spry
though’ elderly Democrat began.
Labeling the Justice Department’s
refusal to allow demonstrators to
march along Pennsylvania Ave.

“shocking,” Morse sounded an
ominous note. “We’ll cease to be
free men and women in this coun-
try." he warned, “if we permit
the repressors to stifle the consti-
tutionally guaranteed rightof peo-
ple to peacefullyiassemble and air
their grievances.”

Rejecting the Nixon adminis-
tration’s allusions to America’s
“silent majority” which alleged-
ly supports the war, the former
Senator declared that, if the as-
sertion is true, it is nevertheless
specious “because the true facts
of our involvement have been con-
celaed from the American peo-

mistake.’ He also called upon
President Nixon to rectify the er-
rors of his predecessors by with-
drawing U.S. troops from Viet-
nam. “We’re a_ very proud peo-
ple,” he admitted, “but we ought

to admit our mistakes and cor- .

rect them.” Dismissing dire fore-
casts of a bloodbath in the wake of
an American withdrawal, the po-
litical veteran predicted, “If you
take American bayonets out of
South Vietnam, the South Vietna-
mese people will themselves get
rid of the quisling Thieu-Ky gov-
ernment.”

Turning finally to the American
conception of communism which
underlies U.S. participation in the

war, the controversial peace ad- _

vocate declared, “I don’t yield to
anyone in my hatred for commun-
ism, but we can’t defeat commun-
ism with bullets. You can’t defeat
an ideawith bullets, but you can
defeat an idea with an idea that’s
a better substitute.” In Morse’s
opinion, literacy and economic

freedom are communism’s two

most potent adversaries.

  Vietnam: Information and History

The watchword of American of-
ficials in Washington and Sai-
gon these days is “Vietnamiza-
tion,” the process of turning over to
the South Vietnamese the main bur-
den of fighting the war in their
homeland. Recently Newsweek's
Saigon bureau chief cabled his
personal assessment of the pro-
gram and its implications. His
report: —

ILLUSION OF VIETNAMIZATION ‘

Reprinted from-NEWSWEEK
by MAYNARD PARKER

All during the 1960’s, through
a series of fumbling half steps
and half measures, the United
States became hopeles.sly_ bog-
ged down in a-land war that it"
did not seek and did not want.
Now the nation wants an end to
the war. But the government is
moving toward this goal with the
same kind of stumbling steps, the
same ambivalence, that first led
it into the quagmire; and this
erratic route may bring a con-

_ clusion no less tragic than the or-
— iginal process of involvement.

There can be little doubl that
the, Nixon Administration is pin-
ning its. main hopes on Vietnam-
ization. In sum, this means that it
has temporarily avoided the
problem of a political solution to
the military victory — this time
through the proxy of the South
Vietnamese Army.

. Six’ months ago, when I stop-
ped off in Paris on my way back
to Vietnam, I was'assured by all
four sides that the war was run-
ning down and assumption
shared by many ordinary Ameri-
cans. But now it is September,
and due partly to North Viet-
namese stone-walling and partly
to President Thieu’s intransi-
gence, there has been no visible
progress toward peace. There is

-little remorse in official Saigon

over the failure of the talks, Fate
has given the U. S. command a
second chance to bring the war to
an end on its own terms, and the
generals believe they can do it
with Vietnamization.

The strategy has definite attrac-
tions for both President Nixon
and President Thieu. On the one

. hand, it will not force the South

Vietnamese leader to broaden
his government in order ‘to win
popular support; on the other, it
will not compel Mr. Nixon to ram
compromises, such as a coalition
- government, down Thieu’s throat.
As for the U. S. command in Sai-
gon, it has been heartened by a
secret report that argues that the

domestic “public-opinion bomb

could be defused" by withdraw-
ing an average of 10,000 troops
a month until after the 1972
U. S. Presidential election. Then
the pullout would end and the re-
maining 250,000»-men would set-
tle in for the duration. As one
strategist expressed it: “We’d put
the war on page seventeen.”

Thursday, Nov. 13, After dark —
March Against Death —— A Viet-
nam Memorial

The first of some 43-45 thous-
and participants — a number from;
each state equivalent to the num-
ber of US battle deaths from each
state, plus a number representing
Vietnamese villages destroyed ‘-
will step off after dark from
Arlington National Cemetary to

Washing-

- form a solemn procgssiongmﬂ/ing__
past the White House single file -.
. and on past the Capitol. The pro-

'cession will continue for some
36 hours though each marcher
will comple_t_e_ the 4-mile walk in

PREMISE: To the contrary, it
seems to me that Vietnamization
could put_ the war back on page
one in headlines as bold as ever
before. For one thing, it is bas-
ed on a premise that few Ameri-

, cans would tolerate: that large

numbers of U. S. troops will
be fighting in Vietnam for per-
haps another decade. The Admin-
istration talks of turning over the
buil of the fighting to the South
Vietnamese by the end of 1971.
But no one here believes that the
Army of the Republic of Vietnam
will be ready by then to cope with
Hanoi’s regulars. Admittedly, the
ARVN has improved. But in gen-
eral its performance remains me-
diocre. Most ARVN divisions
still cling to the‘relatively safe
costal areas, and the desertion
rate still runs an appalling one
man’/in five each year. All indi-
cations are that the ARVN’s im-
provement will continue to be
agaonzinglyf slow, and that the
Americans will still have to do
much of the fighting.. Given
the ARVN’s weaknesses, it seems
highly debatable that a 250,000-
man U. S. force — which would in-
clude a sizable number of com-
bat troops —— can hold the same
ground that half a million GI’s
are now working night andday
to defend.

The reduced American force
might well be subjected to savage
North Vietnamese attacks, and

‘there is strong reason tobelieve

that the ARVN might offer little
help. The siege of the U. S.
Special Forces camp at Ben Het
earlier this year offered an omin-
ous hint of things to come. ARVN
troops refused to defend a U. S.
artillery battery, and when an Am-
erican engineer company was am-

bushed, South Vietnamese of—.

ficers refused to go to its aid.
Relations between the allied ar-
mies are already to strained, in
fact, that the U. S. command has
drawn up contingency plans
for fighting the South Vietnamese,
if‘ necessary, during a final Am-
erican withdrawal.

Thus, it seems to me that the
weekly U. S. death toll might con-
tinueto hover between 150 and
200, even with only half the pre-
sent number of GI’s in South
Vietnam. And unless the war is
ended by an over-all negotiated
settlement,’ South Vietnam -— as
‘well as Laos and Cambodia -

.will remain terribly vulneralbe

to Communist conquest.

BEND: The only alternative to
Vietnamization — and the only
hope for ending the war — is to
push the Saigon government into
a compromise with the Commun-

ists. Such a compromise must al— '
‘ low the Viet Cong’s National Lib-

eration Front to share power in
direct proportion to its popular

support. So far, President Thieu I

has hardly begun to bend. True, he
invited the NLF to join with him
in holding elections. But in almost

the same breath, he warned that
he would jail anyone who espous-
ed a coalition government, or who
used the word “withdrawal” in-
stead of “replacement” to de-
scribe the
Thieu’s police have already jail-
ed scores of non-Communist op-
position members. What, the Viet-
Cong must be asking themselves,
would happen to them if they
surfaced to take part in a na-
tional election‘?

Similarly, Thieu’s choice of
Gen. Tran Thien Khiem, the rank-
ing general in the South Viet-
namese Army, to head his “peace
cabinet” represents a retrench-
ment on the right. It may be too
much to ask Thieu, a rigid anti-
Communist who was handpick-
ed by the U. S. to fight the war
to the bitter end, to willingly tu_rn
his government into an instru-
ment of reconcilation. But if the
war is ever to end, this is precis-
ely what must be done. South
Vietnam needs a predominantly
civilian government, one that
cares more about making peace
than waging war. The only way
to get it is through firm Ameri-
can Pressure. With nearly 40,-
000 Americans already dead, this
is no time for conventional dip-
lomacy. President Thieu must be

made to understand that his best

chance for survival — indeed, his
' only chance — lies in compromise
"with the Communists. And as
risky as that policy will be, Thieu
must realize that if he rejects it,

- he will force the U. S. to make a

deal with Hanoi behind his back.

PAST: At the local level, Am-
erican officials must encourage
the de facto ceasefires — called
“accommodations”——that have al-
ready become common in this
war. Especially in the Mekong
Delta, it is normal procedure for
commanders to stop fighting,
either when a stalemate has been
reached_or when both sides wish
to ha'rvest crops. In the past, the
U.S. has opposed such settle-
ments. But encouraging accom-
modations might bring peace to
large parts of the countryside
withoutﬂwaiting for progress in
Paris.

Certainly, a policy of accom-
modation at the national and lo-
cal levels entails risk. But soon-
er or later, some such risk will
have to be taken. The alternative
is to proceed with Vietnamiza-
tion, a program that promises
only more fighting — much of it
by Americans. Vietnamization
will solve none of the basic
causes of this conflict. It provides
neither a method of reconcilation
nor a means for the total with-

drawal of foreign troops. As an- 1’

thropologist Gerald Hickey has
warned: “If an effort is not
made at accommodation, people
in the U. S. had better be pre-
pared for many years of fight-
mg.”

HISTORY

Current hostilities in Viet-
nam arise directly from events
following the close of World War
II. For nearly two decades prior
to the war, Vietnamese national-
ists, directed in large measure by
Ho Chi Minh, had carried on
an underground struggle for
independence from France. Dur-
ing World War II Ho Chi Minh,
-as head of the Vietminh, con-
tinued as the principal rallying
agent for underground factions
opposed to both French and Jap-
anese occupation. The United
States and Nationalist China re‘-
cognized Ho as the leader of the
nationalist coalition.. The Uni-
ted States supplied the Vietminh
with arms and supplies and in
turn received information on Jap-
anese troop movements.

Because of the outspoken Uni-
ted States opposition to colonial-
ism, the Vietminh and all Viet-
namese had reason to expect
United States ‘support for their
claim to independence following
World War II. They had, after
all, fought on our side against
both Japan and Vichy France.

Potsdam

The Potsdam Agreement provid-

» ed that Chinese Nationalist

troops were to disarm and in-

tern Japanese forces north of the

16th parallel. British troops

were to perform the same task in
the south.

On September 2, 1945 — fol-
lowing the Japanese collapse —
Ho Chi Minh proclaimed from
Hanoi the independence of all
Vietnam.

Return of Colonial Rule
To South Vietnam

British occupation forces, un-
der Major General Douglas Gra-
cey, put their own interpretation
on the Potsdam Agreement and
proceeded to free and rearm the
interned French and Japanese
troops. On September 23, 1945,
the British allowed 5,000 French
paratroopers to despose the Viet-
mi.nh government in Saigon.

British and Japanese troops sup-
ported the French in engage-
ments against Vietnamese units
until enough French reinforce-
ments —- 50,000 of them —— arriv-
ed by December of 1945 to re-es-
tablish total French domination
in the south.

General Douglas A. MacArthur,
commenting on the use of Jap-

The

  
  

‘One of America’s ' _ _, _

anese soldiers to re-establish
European coloniaism in Viet-
nam,said:

If there is anything that makes
my blood boil, it is to see our
allies in Indochina and Java de-
ploying Japanese troops to re-
conquer the little people we prom-
ised to liberate. It is the most
ignoble kind of betrayal.

‘Following difficulties concern-
_ing important customs jurisdic-
tion, the French bombarded Hai-
phong harbor on November‘ 23,
1946, killing 6,000 Vietnamese.
Thus, the French-Indochina War
began.

Broken Promises

In March, 1946, Ho Chi Minh
and the French representative,
Jean Sainteny, negotiated the fol-
, lowing agreement: France recog-
nized the Republic of Vietnam as
a “French State” within the
French -Union, under Ho Chi
Minh, with its capital at Hanoi.
In return, Ho Chi Minh agreed to
the stationing of French troops in
the north with the understanding
that they would be withdrawn by
1951. The French agreed to-per-
mit a referendum as to whether
all of Vietnam would become a
unified, independent state with
the French Union.

France neither withdrew troops
nor held the election. On June
1, 1946, the French recognized
a puppet government in South
Vietnam.

This obstruction to Viet-
namese nationalism resulted in
many Vietnamese — whether_com-
munist or not — fighting for 8
years, under the banner of the
Vietminh, against the French
occupation forces.

First American Involvement —
August, 1950

The first American military ad-
visors arrived in Vietnam — 35 of
them. By 1954, our aid program
had totaled 2.8 billion dollars.
As the French military collapse
accelerated, we underwrote 80
per cent of the cost of their war.

Intervention? I

President Eisenhower decided
against direct intervention to sup-
port the French. He realized the
application of military power
would not resolve a hopeless
political situation in Vietnam.

_ Soccermen Idle; Table Destroys Fiddlers 40-O;
Penn State Next Grabs Independent Grid Crown

With the 1-0 win over Carne-
gie-Mellon Saturday, the soc-
cermen raised their overall
season record to 5-4-1. thus
moving above the .500 mark for
the first time this season. The
booters are now idle until Nov. 22
when they take on Penn State in
the season finale.

If the booters top Penn State. it

y will be the best season for a Leo

Bemis squad since 1965. All-Amer-
ican George Sommers led the
team into the NCAA playoffs that
year.

The Junior Varsity booters
meet Allegheny Community Col-
lege this Saturday on the North
Side. Bemis plans to test at least
two goalies in that battle. Leo
Bunegin. Geroge Hull and Alan
Hackney will all probably defend
the nets. The JV‘s haven‘t played
since Oct. 4 when they defeated the
South Campus of ACC.

IC4A’S NEXT FOR HARRIERS

Jim Banner's cross country
squad is idle until next Monday
when the harriers begin the post
season tournament schedule with
the IC4A‘s in New York City. The
best long distancemen in the East
will be competing in the event.

RIFLERS SEEK NINTH

The rifle squad goes for its
ninth league win Friday at Gene-
va College. Sergeant Sarver‘s
sharpshooters are confident of a
win in the match and they already
hold a win over Geneva earlier in
the year. A win over Geneva
would give the team an overall

The Table marched over the Fiddlers to a 40-0 victory and
the Independent division intramural football championship,

Monday.

The Fiddlers took the opening kickoff, but lost the pigskin
when Ron Meigs intercepted a pass from Fiddler quarterback

Larry Cornetti.

Bob Madar carried the ball on
the next three plays but lost-it on
a bad snap.

Meigs recovered the ball by
picking off another Cornetti pass.

Madar then fired a long pass to
Steve Volk to put the Table in
scoring position. Volk snagged an-
other Madar pass in the end zone
for six points. Madar added two
points with a conversion kick.

The Fiddlers were unable to
move the ball and punted. The
Table booted it back after failing
to make a first down.

The score stood at 8-0 when the
half ended.

The Table received the ball to
open the second half. Madar mov-»
ed the ball with a run and passes

Madar hit Manns with a TD
pass and then kicked a two point
coversion to put the score at 16-0.

Steve Volk put the Table on the
offense again by netting a pass
from Fiddler Larry Cornetti.

Bob‘Flygar then caught a Ma-
dar pass to put the Table ahead by

8:00 p.m. - 12 p.m.

another six points. Madar kicked

another conversion to increase the '

lead to 32-0.

The Table gained control of the
ball again on an interception by
Dan Chobrico.

Madar then hit John Stanich for
six points and added two points
with the kick to give the Table its
40-0 win.

The Table will go against Ran-
dom House Tuesday. The winner
of the contest between the frater-
nity and engineering division will
battle the victor of the Random-
Table game for the campus crown.
