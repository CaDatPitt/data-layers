Regular Edition

University Team
For Radio Debate
Announced Today

Doeringer, Eichelberger To Take
Aiﬁrmative Side Of Supreme
Court Topic January 20

Frank Doeringer, C36, and James
Eichelberger, C38, will represent the
University in the debate against Stan-
ford University on Monday, January
20-, from y.:15 to 5 o’clock over a
nationwide hookup of the National
Broadcasting Company. The names
are announced by Israel L. Goldberg,
C36, intercollegiate manager of the
men’s debating team.

The University team, speaking
from Pittsburgh, will defend the af-
firmative of the question: Resolved,
that Congress shall have the power,
by two—thirds vote. to over-ride deci-
sions of the Supreme Court making
legislation of Congress unconstitution-
al. Taking the negative is the team
from Stanford University, which will
speak from- Los Angeles. .

This marks the ﬁrst time a Univer-
sity debating team will have spoken
over a nationwide network; however,
teams have spoken over the radio be-
fore from _ various cities,_ including
New York, Syracuse, Philadelphia,
Nashville, Miami, and Philadelphia
during the past three years. .

The Debating Association "is plan-
ning a trip to Texas", as part of its
season’s program. Dr. W. M. Parrish.
professor of speech and debating
coach, will accompany the team on
the trip. Speakers for these debates
will be chosen before the ﬁfteenth of
this month. The University team
will defend the affirmative side of the
Supreme Court question ﬁguring in
the Stanford debate, and the negative
of the subject of the dispensation of
medical aid by state governments.

In addition to these contests away
from home, the program arranged by
Goldberg includes debates in Pitts-
burgh with teams from Tulane Uni-
versity, University of Florida, Univer-
sity of Cincinnati, Allegheny College,
and possibly the University of Cali-
fornia.

-Tonight, two teams from the Uni-
versity will debate the Supreme
Court question before the Shaler
Township Parent—Teacher Association.
On the affirmative are Goldberg and
Albert Brandon, C36. Defending the
negative are Arthur Kelley, C37, and
Stanley Rogaliner, C37. ‘

Several other local debates are
scheduled within the next few weeks.
‘There will be one on Friday night in
Ambridge, and one Monday at the
First ‘Lutheran Church. Doeringer,
men’s local debate manager, has ar-
ranged these as part of an intramural
and extension program featuring a
large number of debates on and off
campus.

Prom Chairman
Answers Queries
Sans Superiaiives

“Only three ‘rocks’ for the dance of
the year; and you're going to get
plenty for your money,” said A. W.
Schenck, chairman for the Juniors’
Prom.

“What are you gonna get?” asked
the inquiring reporter.

.“J,ack Miles and his band of bands
to soothe your musical instincts!”
was the answer.

“Dancing from 10 to 2
clock,” was the answer.

“Decorations only to‘ be. described
in superlatives which (if you remem-

on the

ber) we aren’t using!” was the an-

swer. .

“All the trimmings conceived by
the fertile brains of the Junior Prom
committee,” was the answer.

,“We aren’t telling all the answers,”
ﬁnished Schenck.

All committee members are to meet
with Schenck this afternoon at 3:30
o’clock in Room 813, Cathedral.

Another Victory
For Science- -It

WA S Poison Ivy

Defending the honor of The Pitt

News ,as well as that of the depart-»

ment of botany, Dr. 0. E. Jennings,
head of the department, lashed back at
the Bulletin-Index yesterday for its
comment on the “Poison Mistletoe”
story which appeared in the last issue
of The News.

The story had related how two
botany professors in the University,
while dining in an Oakland restaurant,
discovered that the “mistletoe” used
for Christmas decorations was really
poison ivy. Reprinting the article,
the Bulletin-Index added the com-
ment: “What The Pitt News did not
report was that poison ivy, not an
evergreen, appears nowhere at this
time of the year.”

Dr. Jennings thinks differently. “Al-
though poison ivy, drops its leaves in
the fall,” he said, “it does retain its
fruits all winter.” He went on to ex-
plain that these fruits, about the size
of mistletoe berries, are of an ashen
gray color and might be mistaken for
mistletoe.

“In fact,” Dr. Jennings added,
“some years ago the chapel of a cer-
tain educational institution near here
was decorated for the Christmas hol-
iday festivities with, among, other
things, some beautifully fruited
branches of poison ivy. Needless to
say, the results were somewhat unex-
pected.”

 

Engineer Social
Smoker Includes
Basketball Finals

The ‘second event of the Engineer-
ing Association’s social calendar is
scheduled for tomorrow night. This
is the association’s smoker, which
will be held in Trees Gymnasium.
The evening’s entertainment opens
with the playoff of the ﬁnals in the
basketball tournament. The winning
department is to be awarded a silver
cup immediately following the match.

After the basketball games will

..come speakers, movies, and refresh-

ments. The quality and quantity of
these will be improved, it is an-
nounced, because of the success of the
Engineers’ dance.

Chairman Robert Smith, AE36, was
rather vague as to the immediate de-
tails of the program but he said,
“There will be nothing elaborate, just
a regular smoker engineered by engi-
neers for engineers, and constructed
in such a manner as to relieve all
stresses and strains which might keep
those who attend from enjoying them-
selves.”

Arms lnvestigator
To Talk At Forum

Speaker Is Author Of New Book
On Disclosures Of Committee

“American Neutrality” will be the
topic of the ﬁrst Inquiry Forum of
the year today at 12:30 o’clock in
Room 107, Alumni Hall.

Miss Rose M. Stein, contributor to
the “Nation” and the “New Republic,”
will be the speaker.

Until recently she was connected
with the Senate Munitions Investigat-
ing -Committee, and was engaged in
research work under Stephen Raush-
enbush. She was formerly secretary
of the League For Social Justice here
in Pittsburgh.

At the close of the ﬁrst phase of
the work of the Nye Committee, Miss
Stein was commissioned to write a
summary of the investigation to that
point. From the information which
she had at her disposal she wrote at
book, “M-Day” which is to be pub-
lished shortly by Harcourt, Brace,
and company. The book deals with
America’s part in the last war and
the preparations which are going on
for her participation in the next war.

Miss Stein attended the University
for a time, being enrolled in a number
of courses in the Downtown Division.

Recently Miss Stein was one of a
panel of speakers on Dr. Bernard
Clausen’s “Town Hall” program. The
discussion centered around war and
fascism and included a number of
prominent Pittsburghers, including
Harvey O’Connor.

New Film Series

Movies To Depict Film Evolution
From One-Reelers To Talkies

 

The ﬁne arts department will pre-
sent the ﬁrst in.a series of movies
rented from the ﬁlm library of the
Museum of Modern Art on Monday
evening at 8:15 o’clock in the Falk
Elementary School auditorium.

Admission will be by ticket only.
and because of the limitation of the
hall, students taking ﬁne arts courses
will be given preference, according to
V-Valter R. Hovey, acting head of the
department.

If extra tickets are available, an-
nouncement will be made in The Pitt
News.

The success of the department's ex-
periment in exhibiting artistic ﬁlms
here last year was one of the factors
which induced the establishment of
the Museum ﬁlm library in New York
City, John Abbott, general manager,
revealed. The university department
is accordingly the ﬁrst university
group granted the use of the Mu-
seum’s series. The movies will also
be shown by several art museums and
art groups.

The series of pictures for Monday
will illustrate the “development of
the narrative” section of the entire
group, which is a survey of the “Film
in America from 1895 to 1932.”

The nine-reel showing will include
“VVash Day Troubles” (1895); “The
Execution of Mary Queen of Scots"
(1895); “A Trip to the Moon” (1902)
by George Melies; “‘The Great Train
Robbery” (1903) by Edwin S. Potter;
“Faust” (1907); and “Queen Eliza-
beth” (1911) with Sarah Bernhardt.

The entire series, arranged in ﬁve
groups and consisting of 17 ﬁlms, il-
lustrates the development of the
movie from the early beginning to
the talkies of today.

“By the terms of a long contract I
signed,” said Mr. Hovey, “the under-
taking is to befor educational pur-
poses and not.in any event for com-
mercial purposes or proﬂt.” ,

 

Dr. Crawford Reports
Adoption Of Plan
DiVidingWork

By -Milton S. Lehman, Jr.

Following discussion and debate be-
fore members of the faculty of the
College of Arts and Sciences, 3. reor-
ganization of the College curricu-
lum has been approved for adoption
beginning next September, Dr. Stan-
ton C. Crawford, dean of the College,
announced Monday. The plan adopt-
ed will divide the school into upper
and lower units.

During the freshman and sophomore
years, students will engage in gen-

 

eral study during which time they will

dispose of their curricular requisites.
The junior and senior years will be en-
tered upon with the same quality
point requirement stipulated for grad-
uation. .

In explanation of the new program
D1‘. Crawford said: “There are some
who go to college with no well-deﬁned
interest or plan. They desire to take
general courses until judgment can
mature. Many who have se1ected.a,
professional or vocational ﬁeld wish
to devote as much time as possible to
cultural development before beginning
to specialize. Others can afford to
take only two years of college work,”
Dr. Crawford maintained.

With the purpose of enriching the
program of the ﬁrst two years with
broad general courses of the liberal
arts type, the new plan has been in.
stigated. Students will now have a
better opportunity to study their apti-
tudes and to become better acquaint-
ed with the cultural, social, and voca-
tional aspects of contemporary life
and institutions. At the same time a.
f01111dati0I1 for further study is laid
and the general required courses are
taken.

In the upper-Division the student’s
work will be guided by an adviser
representing the department that the
student has selected. as his ﬁeld for
intensive study. Future study will be
planned according to the major inter-
est of the student, and will offer a
more deﬁnite effort toward individual
specialization and individual develop-
ment. Advanced work will comprise
chieﬂy the upper student’s course un-
less the adviser sees ﬁt to provide
further breadth of educational expe-
rience.

Graduation from the lower division
will constitute a college graduation
quality point standing and average
grade. As a basis, the student’s work
in the ﬁrst two years will serve as
criterion; if it is deemed advisable
that the student should not seek ad-
mission to the upper division, that is,
if his work indicates that he will not
likely meet graduation requirements
later, he will be asked to withdraw.
Dr. Crawford made clear the advant-
age of students’ realizing their college
aptitudes before completing the four-
year course. He insisted: “It is bet-
ter that students should know whether
they are college material before they
invest their time and money in a col-
lege education.”

Aptitude Tests Planned

A second announcement from the of-
ﬁce of Dr. Crawford is to the effect
that the incoming freshman will be
given the option of taking placement;
tests to determine his capability in
his selected subjects. The purpose of
the tests will be to place high school
graduates in classes best ﬁtted to
their abilities.

The tests will be offered in the
ﬁelds of ancient and modern lang-
uages, or biology, and, with special
permission, in some other ﬁelds. The
privilege may be granted on the basis
of the high school record alone in the
ﬁelds of chemistry and mathematics.

It is not expected that the student’s
college career will be less than four
years on account of this opportunity.
Rather, the purpose is to place the
student in classes where the subject
matter is appropriate to his level of
attainment. He will ﬁnd more interest
and proﬁt in such classes that in the
"usual freshman work, which may
often seem to be more or less of a
review of material already studied. In
the latter college years he will still
be ahead of his classmates in the
ﬁelds of study where he began to do
more advanced work.

All inquiries about this plan should
be addressed to the College office of
the University, Room 205, State Hall.

SFA Committee To Select
Managers Of Tea Dance
Two men and one woman from each

of the undergraduate classes will be
selected by the Social Committee of

SFA to manage the SFA Tea Dance -

which will be held in the middle of
February at the Schenley Hotel.

There will be no applications made
for membership on the dance com-
mittee. The 12 members will be se-
lected from the student body by the
Social Committee, headed by William
McQuade, E37. Other members are:
Miss Isabelle Anderson, assistant to
the dean of women; N, Robert Seidle,
assistant to the dean of men; Sylvia
Fixel, C36; Elizabeth. Glass, Ed36;
James Ballantyne, C36; «Leo Ryan,
C37; and" Charles Ebert, C36.

When White Is Black

(Reports in local newspapers of the action
taken by the American Association of University
Professors in placing the University on the asso-
ciation's “blacklist” on December 31 at its con-
vention in St. Louis have doubtless been so gen-
erally perused that additional accounts of the ac-
tion are hardly necessary.)

S HAD BEEN PROPHESIED, the American Associa-

tion of University Professors saw ﬁt to censure the
University for alleged discrepancies in its system of
‘tenure and for an alleged lack of academic freedom.
}This union of professors calls its method of censure
“blacklisting” and that term somehow leaves a bad taste
in the mouths of some people.

Vvhile the action of any organized body in such a
matter is not to be dismissed without any regard, it must
be admitted that the policies of this particular body run
somewhat in the parallel of the dog whose bark is worse
than his bite. Contrary to some false beliefs which are
heard now and then, the AAUP has no accrediting power.
The University continues to be recognized as an accred-
ited institution by every oflicial accrediting group, as is
generally known.

The point of the whole situation most hard to under-
stand is that such a group, a collection of professors
from all parts of the country, is willing to accept the re-
sponsibility for imposing a blacklist censure upon an in-
stitution whose workings, background, and problems it
has taken only a brief time to survey. Last spring the
AAUP sent a committee which stayed for only a few
days on the University campus and left with what it be-
lieved enough material to justify the censure. Particu-
larly does this seem bewildering in the light of the ef-
forts of the University’s own committee to investigate
tenure here, a committee composed of several of the
most bril1ia.nt minds among the faculty, which has been
hard at work for some weeks and has not yet announced
a completed job.

Nobody is going to take the AAUP action too se-rious-
ly. So long as the University realizes that there may be
such a thing as a tenure problem here, and has taken
steps to consider it fairly, the censure of outsiders need
cause not even a smattering of shame. And the only vis-
ible penalty imposed upon the University by the profes-
sors’ union’s recent action, that of prohibiting its mem-
bers to accept positions here, should be no great bother.
If the University should so desire the services of one of
these that it would oﬁer him a salary increase to come
here, you would call him the rare fellow indeed who

would not feel justiﬁed in dropping out of _the union

organization.

Christmas. Last year the bewhiskered gentleman
left_a system of hot water running in the Cathedral, a
gift which was hailed with nothing less than genuine glee
by students returning from vacation. Then, too, it was
at about the same time two years ago that walls around

the base of the structure began to take form.

On Monday, students hurrying to classes in the Cathe-
dral with all compunction of keeping New Year’s resolu-
tions for punctuality were startled to ﬁnd themselves re-
routed to classrooms on the second and third ﬂoors of
the building. True, there wasn’t any plaster on the walls
of those classrooms and the ceilings la.cked the ﬁnishing
touches, but there they were—properly lighted, adequate-
ly heated, and ready for service.

To those who have come to the University in the last
year or so, the opening of these new rooms may not
have any great signiﬁcance. But seniors and juniors,
who have felt the winds whipping through‘ the open
framework of those ﬁrst ﬂoors in times when the outlook
for completing those walls and halls looked very dark,
certainly rejoice in some measure upon observing an-
other step toward a ﬁnished Cathedral.

It is nicely coincidental that the accumulation of holi-
day mail includes a clipping from the Temple University
News, a bit of comment by one of the delegates to the
Intercollegiate Newspaper Association’s convention here
last November:

“The Pitt Cathedral of Learning isn’t everything it’s
boomed to be. Of the 41 odd floors, about the only
ones being used are the ﬁrst, the seventh, and the
seventeenth. The building is big and impressive from
the outside, but the classrooms do not even have plas-
ter on the walls, and you can’t tell the difference be-
tween the wooden scaffolding a.nd the elevator doors.”

Among other things, the gentleman obviously didn’t
believe in looking into the eighth, ninth, tenth, eleventh,
twelfth, thirteenth, and fourteenth ﬂoors. While the
Temple delegation went away with a couple of cups, they
certainly didn’t go away with much of an idea of what
the Cathedral is becoming.

. Now a suggestion might be that no visitor to the build-

‘,-_ing should be permitted to leave without making a tour
'3 of the libra.ry on the ﬁfth ﬂooor.

In fact, as soon as that
‘section generally is opened, it will be the rare student
who will deny himself a sly pinch or two to make sure
he is not dreaming the ﬁrst time he sees the splendor
that is there.

 

Add famous fadeouts from the sports pages: The live-
ly controversy over the city football cup situation when
the councilmen dug up the ordinance dealing with the
cup arr’; foiinrl it provided that permanent possession of
tl':=-:- Ll‘(.i]’l‘:l§' should go to the school winning it three
1’in1cs—'v-rhicli. had previously made it all Pitt’s own! Oh
well, but think of the fun we had.

It would hardly be fair to mention the name of the
person who remarked, after digesting all this poison ivy-
mistletoe business, that next Christmas when standing
under some of the green stuff he’ll be worried to death
wondering whether to start kissing or scratching.

A College Divided

T WILL CERTAINLY be of great interest to educators
and students alike to watch the results of the new
plan recently adopted by the University College of Arts
and Scientists. The reorganized curriculum of that
school, to go into effect in the coming September, is de-
signed to present a broader program to the student.

There can be little doubt that the changes planned are
bound to be of deﬁnite beneﬁt to future College students.
More and more there are freshmen enrolling without
any definite ideas of a ﬁeld in which to specialize. Some
of these have been ﬁtted into survey courses, with good
results. Others attempt to make a decision of course
specialization immediately and many of them shift it
just as consistently, hopping about from ﬁeld to ﬁeld in
the manner of a boy on a pogo stick.

For those who have determined to follow a certain
profession or vocation, the two years of broad general
courses of a liberal arts type will aid materially in set-
ting a background for cultural development. Students
able to afford only a two-year course, will likewise re-
ceive the beneﬁts of a well-rounded education on general
matters.

With a polished background such as the Lower Divi-
sion, comprising the freshman and sophomore years, is
designed to give, the student should have little diﬁiculty
in moving into a concentration of studies to prepare him
for his chosen interest. The added premium of more in-
dividual development must also be considered in evaluat-
ing the worth of the new system.

Turn Of Year Finds Faculty Members
Sizing Up Past, Guessing At Future

The New Year has come, and Uni-
versity faculty men are looking back-
ward and forward to point out the
milestones on the road to progress.

In their own ﬁelds they predict air-
plane speeds up to 750 miles per hour.
a steady ﬂow of University graduates
into the industrial and economic life,
advances in growth discoveries, a bit-
ter political campaign, wider choices
in student curricula, and longer peri-
ods of preparation.

Th e outstanding engineering
achievement of the past year is the
completion of the mighty Boulder
Dam, “the hugest piece of construc-
tion ever built by man,” in the opin-
ion of E. A. Holbrook, dean of the
Schools of Engineering and Mines.

The perfection of a seismographic
device which can detect deposits of
crude oil as much as 4,000 feet below
ground level is another engineering
feat which Mr. Holbrook considers of
major importance. “Engineering has
scored a real victory when it has
found this wa.y of discovery what lies
almost a mile beneath our feet.”

Still another noteworthy feat, ac-
cording to Mr. Holbrook, is the amaz-
ing perfection of the modern auto-
mobile. High speed, low price, and
comfort in a degree that ten years ago
was hardly dreamed possible make
this a major engineering achievement.

And what of the future? Henry C.
Pavian, assistant professor of aero-
nautical engineering, predicts with
conﬁdence airplane speeds up to 750
miles an hour close to the ground,
with much higher rates in strato-
sphere. “And perhaps,” surmised Mr.
Pavian, “as Irenee DuPont said, we
are headed for a new power supply.
What that is, we can only guess.
Breaking up of the atom? Liquid air?
The sun? Who can say?” ’

“Now that business is well under

way we look ahead with much con-
fidence,” says Dr. Charles S. Tippetts,
clean of the School of Business Ad-
ministration. “The greatest tragedy
of the depression was the difficulty it
placed in the way of boys and girls
who wished to get a university ed-
ucation. That they should become
discouraged was to be expected. New,
hope has returned.

“As family incomes increase it will
be possible for those whose further
education has been delayed to enter
or return to the University. Business
is again looking for intelligent and
well-trained young men and women.
Again we can expect a steady flow of
university graduates into the indus-
trial and commercial life of Pitts-
burgh. One of the greatest needs of
the country today is intelligent busi-
ness leaders.”

There have been no revolutionary
advances in biology, but rather a
great many signiﬁcant discoveries, Dr.
Robert T. Hance, professor of biology,
feels.

“Those which are of particular in-
terest to the University are the ad-
vancements iii the ﬁeld of growth
study. Three outstanding discoveries
were made in this ﬁeld, with which
the University biological research pro-
gram deals: animal growth without
either paternal or maternal nuclei was
demonstrated by centrifuging sea-
urchin eggs and then treating them
with concentrated sea water; the
plant ‘hormone auxin,’ chemical sub-
stance stimulating growth, was pro-
duced synthetically; and irritability
in protoplasm was traced to a sub-
stance of unknown composition called
IR”) I’

Dr. James C. Charlesworth, asso-
ciate professor of political science,
states: “I think the 1936 campaign
will be more bitter, more costly, and

more signiﬁcant than any campaign
since 1896. I predict that campaign
expenditures by each party will be
close to ten million dollars each, more
by far than any other political cam-
paign in the history of our nation.

“Political scientists in the past
year were perhaps too cautious in
characterizing political and social
movements of the year. Writings
emphasized academic accuracy rather
than bold prophecy; in other words,
their accent was on the ‘science’
rather than the ‘political’ of political
science.”

“In the College,” points out Dr.
Stanton C. Crawford, dean, “It seems
to me that more attention is being
given to building on the students’
own major interests. Two recent ac-
tions of the faculty point in that di-
rection. A basic idea underlying the
separation of lower and upper divi-
sions is that the student will meet
practically all of his speciﬁc require-
ments a.nd distribution requirements
during the ﬁrst two years, so that in
the upper division he will be free to
build a well—integ1-ated group of
courses around his major and minor
subjects under the guidance of his
major professor. (See story on page
one.) Other arrangements now un-
der consideration by the College fac-
ulty look toward the enrichment of
the curriculum from the cultural stand-
point as well as provision for wider
selection in ﬁelds where the student
has special interests.”

Dr. Charles Prall, dean of the
School of Education, says it is entirely
possible that for those freshmen of
1937 in the school, training will be ﬁve
years long for high school teachers.
Dr. Prall also advises that require-
ments are being raised and an in-
creasing number turned down every
year because of the surplus of teach-
ers caused by the depression.

Is Florida sunny? You can’t prove
it by Russell A. Dixon, instructor in
economics, who has just returned
from a Christmas sojourn in the so-
called “winter paradise.” In fact, the
sun shone on only two of the eight
days he was there, but that didn’t
stop Mr, Dixon from doing some in-
teresting observing in the land of
oranges. '

One of the highlights of the trip
was a visit to the University of Miami
at Coral Gables, Florida. Here nearly
1,000 students are being taught in an
abandoned hotel. This situation is
made necessary by the lack of funds
to complete the original layout of the
school which, according to Mr. Dixon,
is several times larger than that of
Columbia University in New York.
The administration building alone,
which will include only the offices of
the faculty, will be almost twice as
large as Alumni Hall. What proved
to him more interesting was the fact
that three of the four men who are
running the school were formerly con-
nected with the University.

The president, Bowman Ashe, and
the treasurer, H. H. Provin, were on
the faculty here, the former as dean
of men and the latter as a profes-
sor of physical education. Jay Pear-
son, the secretary, was a former stu-
dent liero and with Mr. Dixon and
three others founded the Omega Delta
fraternity on the campus. This fra-
ternity is now known as Pi Kappa
Alpha. Since these former members
of the University have take.“ over the
reins at Miami, the school has drawn
students from every state of the

Union and has grown quite prosper-
ous.
One of the strangest experiences of

the junket. as Mr. Dixon recalls it,
was riding for two hours through
Coral Gables aid the surrounding

country over paved roads lined on
both sides with sidewalks six feet
wide and nothing on each side but va-
cant lots and a few scattered shacks.
This was explained as a result of
the depression. The lots were bought
when prosperity was at its peak but
with the crash in ’29, hundreds of for-
tunes, including countless Florida
real estate investments, were swept
away.

Mr, Dixon emphasized this state-
ment by pointing out that lots that
at one time sold at $100,000 are now
being bought for $50. One notable
example of this deﬂation is the recent
sale of the home of William Jennings
Bryan at Cocoanut Grove. The house
was sold by Bryan’s widow shortly
after his death for $750,000 yet only
recently it was bought by a Cleveland
business man for $50,000. Another in-
stance mentioned, was the case of a
huge $2,000,000 hotel which the own-
ers are today using as a poultry farm.

One encouraging sign of the return
of prosperity is the increase in the
number of people traveling south this
winter. Mr. Dixon stated that on the
particular train on which he was trav-
eling there were 14 Pullmans and two
coaches while in the last few years
the average traffic going south car-
ried only three Pullmans and one
coach. He estimated that there was
a 100 per cent increase in housing fa-
cilities for this winter.

Religions To Be Topic
At Luncheon Meetings

“What you ought to know about
our faith" will be the theme of a se-
ries of three luncheon meetings, the
ﬁrst of which is to be held on Friday,
between 12:30 and 2 o’clock, in the
YM-YWHA, on Belleﬁeld Avenue.

At the ﬁrst meeting, Dr. Bernard
C. Clausen, pastor of the First Bap-
tist Church, will give an interpreta-
tion of Protestantism. Dr. Clausen
will be followed by Father Pauley of

the St, Paul Cathedral, on Friday,
January 17, who will interpret
Catholicism.

The series will be brought to a
close by Rabbi Solomon B. Freehof,
of the Rodef Shalom, who will inter-
pret Judaism, on Friday, January 24.

Under the combined sponsorship
of the YM-YWCA,YM-WI-IA, and the
Newman Club, these meetings will
try “to break down barriers of mis-
understanding father than serve as
propaganda for any particular faith,”
according to Vvilliam VV. Mendenhall,
executive secretary of the YMCA.

Tickets for the luncheon, priced at
350, may be secured from any of the
participating organizations.

Mittmen Practice

During Holidays

Prepare For Opener At Syracuse;
Eight-Meet Schedule

If taking a wicked right on the chin
and feeling the effects of a steady
stream of left jabs to the eye might
be considered a pleasant way to spend
the holidays, then the members of
the boxing squad have had a very
merry Christmas. They spent their
vacation in the YM-YWHA ring
quarters, where daily practice sessions
were in progress.

As the opening match draws near,
Coach Jack Schricker is sending his
proteges through a strenuous _drill
week. Varsity positions are still to
be decided, and there are many hot
battles being waged, especially in the
145-pound class.

‘Opening on January 18 at Syracuse,
the ringmen are scheduled to appear
at home on January 25 with West
Virginia furnishing the opposition. W
& J follows on the home card on Feb-
ruary 1. Catholic U is to be met at
Washington on February 15, followed
by Wisconsin at Madison on the 21st.
Temple will appear here on February
26. The schedule draws to an end
with Bucknell at Lewisburg on March
7 and Carnegie Tech at Pitt on
March 14.

Tonight the ﬁghtmen will be dined
in grand style. A banquet, scheduled
for 6:30 o’clock tonight in the YM=HA
Banquet Room. will be attended by
approximately 40 members of the box-
ing squad. The principal speaker will
be W. Don Ha.rrison, director of ath-
letics at the University.

Coach Schricker announces that
candidates will still be accepted and
anyone interested should contact him
immediately.

Dates For Boxing
Tournament Set

 

 

Intramural Event Starts Monday;
Fraternities Expected To Enter

The long awaited and just as long
postponed intramural boxing tourna-
ment will be ﬁnally run off on Jan-
uary 13, .14, and 15 at the Stadium.
Entries may still be made by either
independents or fraternity ring aspir-
ants.

Martin J. Feely, director of intra-
mural athletics, ha.s received the gold
a.nd silver awards which will be pre-
sented to the ﬁrst and second place
winners. A fraternity cup will also
be awarded if six or more fraternities
enter the tournament. Fraternity
team scores will be computed on the
basis of number of men entered and
number of matches won.

lliraternity men will also be eligible
for the individual awards.

According to the schedule 119, 129,
139, ancl 149—pound preliminaries will
be held Monday at 4 o’clock in the
Stadium, with 159, 169, 179, and
heavyweight preliiiis to be held the
next day at the same time and place.
The ﬁnals are scheduled for Wednes-
day, January 15.

Une Quartet That Will Not Be In Harmony Tonight

Trackmen Point
For AMA Meet
In Track House

With the return to school of the
bulk of his track men, Coach Olson
points his large squad in the direction
of the annual AMA indoor meet,
sponspored by the Univerity. Entry
blanks were distributed to the crack
runners and jumpers in the Aile-
gheny Mountain district. Saturday,

for this event, set for January 25 in
the Track House.

John T. Taylor, secreta.ry-treasurer
of the AMA, will receive entries up
and until January 20, ﬁve days before
the meet. Olson intends to run vir-
tually the entire varsity and freshman
squads in the competition, hoping to
get a line on his possibilities for the
Millrose Games in Madison Square
Garden just one week later.

Sol Menaker, sprint star, has al-
ready been extended a bid to this
select nat.ional event. The Pitt relay
quartet likewise has been invited to
compete. This marks the ﬁrst year
that a Pitt entry has rated a place in
the inajor relay race of the games
along with Manhattan, Holy Cross,
and a fourth team to be chosen at a
later date.

According to present form and com-
petition, the Pitt quartet for the af-
fair would include Harold Connelly,
who Olson believes stands alone in
nearing top condition, Andy Lasky,
Art Thomas, and Charley G-roat.
Lasky, ex-VVPIAL hurdle and weight
champion while at New Castle High
School, looks to he in pretty fair
shape and has been giving his varsity
mates plenty of competition at this
early date.

At the Knights of Columbus games
before a packed house in New York
City, Sol Menaker placed third in
the 80-yard race and sixth in two
others, for an aggregate total of 15
points and sixth in the individual
scoring. O’Sullivan of the New York
Curb Exchange equaled three recog-
nized world records for the board
track in the century, S0-yard, and 60-
yard distances.

Linesman’s Oversight Ends
Match As Jarvis Beats
Bob In Net Play

A few scattered cheers were all
that Alfred Jarvis received for heat-
ing Bob Madden, Pitt’s net star, in
the semi-ﬁnal round of the National
Junior indoor tennis championships in
New York during the holidays.

'I‘li:-3 unsportman-like attitude of the
large crowd came as the result of an
adverse line decision called against
Madden, which ended a very heated
and hard-fought match. The scores
were 6-2, 5-7, 8-6. According to Mad-
den, Jarvis, one of the best of the
younger players in the country, IJlead-
ed‘ for some time with the officials to
be allowed to play the point over.

Vvhile Bob was disappointed at the
outcome after coming so close to the
title he has been seeking for the past
three. winters, he received the com-
mendation of all New York sports
writers for his sportsman-like conduct
in taking one gracefully on the chin
from the oﬁicials.

Bob created the major upset of the
net event by eliminating Charles
\Vachman, seeded No. 2 player from
Nortliwestern, iii a. quarter-ﬁnal match
by scores of 6-4, 6-0. Before that he
had advanced through four rounds
with straight set victories in two at‘-
fairs and a. couple of defaults.

Jarvis went on to win the tourna-
ment, taking over Don Leavens. tour-
ney favorite, in the ﬁnal bracket, It
was this same Jarvis who upset Bob’s
hopes last winter in a three-set match.
“It’s not the bad decision that burns
me up, so much as the four other
times in the ﬁnal set that I had
chances to win that match,” says Mad-
den, as he takes time out from study-
ing his French.

City Title Fight At Stadium With Tech Battle

 

Aiming to break a jinx that has
seen them drop 21 straight games
over a period of nine years, Carnegie
Tech’s cagers drop into the Pitt Sta-
dium tonight to face Di‘. Carlson’s
powerful Panthers in the opening
Eastern Intercollegiate conference tilt
for the Pitt team. It also starts the
scramble for the city title among the
Techs. the Dukes, and the Pitts.

Since far back during the 1926-27
season when Howard Harpster drop-
ped a last minute ﬁeld goal to give
the Tartans a 25-24 victory, the Tech
ﬁves have yet to walk off the ﬂoor
with a decision over the Panthers.

For the Panthers. a victory would
provide an excellent start in their
quest for their fourth straight confer-
ence title, a title that has been held
by the Golden Cats ever since the coii-
ference was formed. Then, too, the
Panthers are anxious to get away to
a good start in the annual city round-
robin. Last season, the Pitt team and
the Dukes shared the title, each with
three victories and one defeat. This
year's scrap promises to be even more
torrid than that of last year, since all
three of the city teams boast excep-
tionally strong ﬁves.

In the records thus far this season
the Panthers show the way to the
Tech accomplishments. In ten games,
nine away from home, the Pitt ﬁve
has won eight and dropped two of
the decisions. Losing only to North-
western and Kentucky, they have
waded through VV&J, Iowa, Butler,‘
Xavier, Vanderbilt, Tulane twice, and
ﬁnally Louisiana St.ate.

Tartans Break Even

On the other hand the Tech ﬁve
has broken even in four starts, de-
feating Westminster a.nd Case while
dropping games to- Waynesburg and
West Virginia. However, in a game
between any two of the city teams,
past records mean little or nothing,
and Tech will admit defeat only when
the Panthers show more points at the
end of tonight’s game than the Tar-
tans can show.

Dr. Carlson will Dbobably start the
same ﬁve that was used in most of
the starting lineups on the recent
Southern trip. Usually the good doc-
tor used his second team to start the
game with Zeleznick, Loucks, Noon
Radvansky, and Rowe getting the
nod. On the ﬁrst ﬁve, Captain Ted
Roderick, Billy Jesko, Joe Garcia, Bob
Johnson. and Ed Spotovitch answered
to the doctor's call. His starting ﬁve
tonight will probably not be known
until the opening whistle.

On Carnegie’s starting ﬁve will be
nearly all last year veterans. Ca.ptain
Macalka and Gibson will be at for-
wards, either James or Fitzwilson at
center, and Felser and Patt at the
guards for the Plaid.

Rival Sher'man’s March

During the Christmas vacation the
Panthers did an excellent job of
showing the South what a good has-
ketball team looks like by taking ﬁve
of the six games on the trip.

Kentucky, co—cliampions of the
Southeastern Conference and consid-
ered one of the outstanding ﬁves in
the South again this year, measured
off the touring Panthers, 35-17, before
a packed house of rabid Lexington
cage fans. It was mutually agreed

that Pitt hit an off night, missing ﬁve
straight fouls before converting even
one charity toss. This, however, did
not ta.ke any credit away from the
rangy Colonels who zipped in buckets
for an amazingly high-scoring per-
centage.

Carlson's passers barely nosed out
a fast Xavier ﬁve in Cincinnati on
the ﬁrst leg of the trip, 23-21. Fol-
lowing the Kentucky loss, Pitt
climbed back into the win column to
swamp a good Vanderbilt squad at
Nashville, 57-32. _

In two vacation tilts with Tulane
during the closing week of 1935, Tu-
lane’s ﬁne new floor burned under
two Panther oiislaughts. Touring
Texans in for the Texas Christian-
Louisiana State Sugar Bowl grid
classic and the folks of New Orleans
were amazed with a display of Carl-
son basketball that swept aside the
Greenv wave, 48-25, ﬁrst, and then
even worse, 48-13. Tulane Vva.s‘help-
less before the quick-tlirusting Pan-
thers, who topped off the ﬁrst fray
with a ﬁgure “8” display that had the
home folks dizzy.

The big Panther Cat was plenty
soared in the Sugar Bowl intersec-
tional cage contest, with Pitt repre-
senting the North and Louisiana State
upholding the South. Pitt avenged
a close defeat handed out by the
Tigers at Atlantic City last season, to
win the Sugar Bowl cage title.

utes of play that the Panthers pulled

through Georgia seem like a. retreat
as they bombed the northern boys to
lead, 12-2, and later, 22-6, before the
Carlson forces were organized and
started tossing back a few them-

Roderick led the assault, ringing
two long ones in near the end of the

with a free toss. Arnold Biyan, Tiger
l’orwai'd, never was stopped, however,
as he made his 25th point of the game
with a long one.

Then, Pittsburgh ﬁnally tied things
up at 37-all, with seven minutes re-
maining. From there oii in, the Pitts
applied the pressure, and with one
minute remaining. Pitt led, 52-45, be-

to end the scoring for the evening.
Coach Carlson and Captain Roderick
were presented with the Sugar Bowl
cage trophy, a huge silver ball. sur-
rounded by five miniature basketeers,
and supporting a silver Diana with
the outstretched laurel wreath.

The diminutive Roderick was easily
the individual standout on the tour.
All Ted did was to score 60 points in
the six games, 16 coming in the LSU
battle at a time when they were
needed.

The Panther freshies will face the
Tech frosh at 7 o’clock in the prelim-
inary to tonight’s varsity game. The
varsity affair is scheduled to come on

game.

Nu1'se;l\7lay Earn
University Degree

30 Credits Toward Total Must
Be Earned In Nursing School

Registered nurses who complete ad-
ditional University work may receive
the degree of Bachelor of Science
with a major in nursing, in combined
courses established by both the
School of Education and the College
of Arts and Sciences at the Univer-
sity. Dr. Stanton C. Crawford, dean
of the Collegefannounced Monday.

’l‘hirty credits toward the 120 re-
quired for the degree will be granted
for a three-year nurses’ course com-
pleted in an approved school of nurs-
ing or hospital training school. These
students will be expected to meet the
usual University requirements and to
present a recommendation from the
head of the nursing school. At least
90 credits of work will be given at
the University.

In the School of Education the
nursing training is recognized as the
major ﬁeld of study. However it may
be broken up to give partial credit
toward a biological science major. In
either case, students will be taking
work in two ﬁelds of study applicable
to high school teaching. The comple-
tion of the combined course will en-
title students to receive certiﬁcates
to act as school nurses and, if courses
are properly chosen, to teach health
and certain other subjects in Penn-
sylvania high schools.

In the College, supplementing the
major work in nursing, a minor ﬁeld
may be selected which will provide
the professional courses needed in
preparation for public health nursing,
executive or administrative positions,
or social service work.

Visual Aid Classes Learn Intricacies

Gf Exhibit A rrangemenls At Museum

 

‘In the subterranean chambers of
the Carnegie Museum, the students of
the two Visual Aids classes of the
University learned the mysteries of

the diplodoci and dinosauri of the pre-
historic animals room.

A guide explained the process used
in rebuilding the bipeds and quad-
rupeds who roamed the earth ages
ago. The bones, which are found in
sand or other earthy composition,
must be taken out by hand, hollow-
ed out, and ﬁlled with a preserving
composition. Then they are lacquer-
ed and ﬁt together. Very few of the
bones are found to be missing, but
these few are made artiﬁcially so that
the animal can be completed.

l’-‘rom the basement, the groups
were led upstairs to the taxidermist’s
room where Mr. Remi H. Santens,

chief taxidermist of the -Carnegie Mu-
seum, demonstrated and lectured to
them. The members were shown how
the animals were stuffed, an owl be-
ing used for demonstration purposes.
The bird is ﬁrst hollowed out, a form
with the exact contour of the bird is
made and the feet are attached to
this form by wire, Then the skin is
fitted over the form.

The group also learned what is
done with the eggs of the bird. A tiny
hole is pricked in one end of the shell,
from which the inside of the egg is
drawn. Then the empty shell is
either placed inside the nest in a dis-
play or attached to the nest by wire.

Other animals in the various stages
of stuffing were shown before the stu-
dents adjourned to the hall of the
mammals to study the rocky moun-

tain goat display.
