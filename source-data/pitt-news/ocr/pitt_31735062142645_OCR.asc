‘Demonstration  A

At Game Tomorrow

No obstaéles remain to keep
Pitt’s gold and blue demonstra-
tion block from making its twice
postponed ﬁrst appearance of the
year at the Pitt-Purdue game Sat-
urday.

“Our plans are complete,” Ted
Mallinger, chairman of the block,
stated, “and it‘ is now up to the
members of the block to show up
in full force Saturday and -make
the show a success.”

Originally scheduled to appear
at the West Virginia game, plans
for the block have been .held up
for weeks by the power shortage
and the subsequent inability of
the laundries to clean the capes.
Now with all obstacles out of the
way, more than 900 students, sit-
ting close to the ﬁfty yard line in
section 17,.,will comprise the block.

Wearing gold and blue capes,
the demonstrators, by means of
the , contrasting colors, will spell
out a huge"‘P” for_Pitt .f

shape of a ‘panther and spell out
PURDUE. ’ T

Admission to the block will be
limited‘ to members of several im-
portant campus organisations in-
cluding. most of_the fraternities
and sororities, the YMCA, Can-
terbury club, Veterans association,
the Womens’ Choral society and
the Mens’ Gleelclub. Each of these
organizations will be furnished
with a limited number of white
cards which will be. admission
tickets_to the demonstration bloek
section of the stadium. ,

Capes will be distributed at the
entrance to the block.

seats will be a guide to[d‘emon-
strators showing who is to turn

Cap and Down

States Aims

Cap and Gown, in full swing
for the first time since the end of
the war, offers men at Pitt the
opportunity’ to learn dancing, act-
ing, stage producing, and man-
aging. A i '

No man needs to be a Fred As-
taire or tLauritz Melchior. Mr.
Herbert Clark, the new director,
says, “We’re going to 2. ' the em-
phasis on movement, lighting,’ and
costuming.” Wither without pre-
vious experience, all men inter-
ested are being given the chance’
to see what they can do in the
theatrical ﬁeld. States Mr. Clark:
“I’m giving everybody a genuine
crack at the thing.” - ‘

Ticket, publicity, and business
managers are needed for the bus-
iness staff of Cap and Gown. Orig-
inal ideas and specialty acts to be
considered and chosen by the stu-
dents will be used in the produc-
tions. e
“What I believe above all,” Mr.
Clark insists, “is that the spirit
eclipses all the technical material.
If a man is interested and will-
ing to take a chance at a job, he
is material for Cap, and Gown.”

‘of four years that they spend at the University. Therefore, it
eems a good guess to blame Pitt men for the jitterbug perform-
;_ance when either of the two songs is played.’ P

dent toknow the words and the" melody of the school songs.
Zhen they are played there should be singing from -100 per
‘cent of the student body. The better theco—operation on the
singing, the more the songs will be-played. Strange it seems,

Now that Pitt ’sprodigal activities have regained and sur-
passed pre-war size, the student body looks for greater perfec-
{tion in their products. They are justiﬁed in _that search.
Numbers are adequate in -most of the campus organizations
but size is only a small measure of the total requirements.
During the next few months we will be able to judge if these
bulging groups have the second essential of perfection, adequate
leadership. - D C ,

C _, The war years caught Pitt, along with every school in the‘
country, with its leadership down. Few people could be relied
iipon, and these few soonbecame work horses. They were
called upon for every major and minor task -concerning Pitt’s
ctivities. Some of them were capable, somewere not. And
Pitt’s ‘extracurricular standards slid lower because of it.
g‘-l‘here is only one direction Pitt’s activities can go on the
quality ladder. New leaders must assume the responsibility of
directing that upward climb. But they cannot do it alone. They
need the support of the students—even the outsider who has
no hold on activities. ' '

it _, The reﬂective attitude of the student body can go far in
perfection of the work of these groups. Dull, inarticulate rumb-
lings in disapproval of actions generally escape the hardened.
ears of the BM and BWOC. It is the sharpened barb of public
criticism, outspokenly constructive, which produces the desired
results. °

societies, the Cap and Gown club, and more, need criticism.
These organizations are on the upgrade, but they are far from
perfect. They represent this university on campuses and in
newspapers throughout the country. ,

‘You, as members of the student body, must tell us What you
want to represent you. Since the Pitt News is the official sound-
ing board for student opinion, it is the logical place for amateur
critics’ outlets. We want your letters concerning Pitt activi-
l’es, not excluding ourselves. We Want them constructive.
Next week, the News ‘will inaugurate its “letters to the
feditor” department for publication in the Friday edition. Let-
‘ “r requirements are, simply, brevity and pertinence. We Want
on to take an active interest in- the organizations which repre-
 tiyou--and this ‘is the only way we can do it.

The I“new” Pittsburgh Sympho-

its 20th anniversary proved that
Fritz Reiner is truly a, “miracle
, man.” It is unbelievable that the

nel so, frequently in large num-
bers, can maintain itself as one
of, the country’s ﬁnest.

ers was clearly’ evidenced‘ in Dr.
Reiner’s energetic rendition of
Bach’s popular “Toccata and. Fu-
, guein D Minor.” The greater ton-
al qualities also prevailed in the
readings of Brahm’s “4th Sym-
lphony” and Debussy’s
and Festivals.” The enthusiasm

these - works was something‘ new

Students Asked .
T 0 Contribute
$2 Average

Slated as the only University-
wide campaign for this semester,
the Pitt Community Chest drive
wﬂl shift into high gear next
week. 100 student speakers have
volunteered to contact all third
hour wclasses next Wednesday and
Thursday in order to attain the
goal of “an average contribution
of. $2.” ’

Mary Jane Dunsmoor and John
Riddle, co-chairmen of the stu-
dent campaign,~ point _out that
“the success of the drive can not
be measured merely in dollars
and cents. In contributing, we
help our needy, our community,
ahd ourselves.”

Three-fourths of the contribu-
tions not exceeding $3000 will
remain on campus, to be distrib-
uted among the Young Men "and
Young Women’s Christian as-
sociations and the men’s and
women’s student loan funds. A
share of the student dgations
will be sent to “Pitt in China,” a
group of Pitt graduates teaching
in China. s V I

Remaining funds are to be
given to the Alleglt-env county
chest. This chest aids numerous
institutions, such as child and
family welfare agencies, health
services, settlement ‘ houses, and
the United Service organizations.

The familiar little red feather
will again be the symbol of a
Community «Chest contribution,
and will be distributed by _ the
student speakers to‘ those persons
making or pledging contributions.

Student chairmen participating
in the drive are: ‘Peggy Baird,

bill; Joan Hall and Bob Vogelsang,

materials; Helen Zezones and Mi-
lan Govic, booth; Rudy Balaban,
solicitations; Adrienne Aldisert
and Bill Zeﬁiro, speakers; Mary
Lou McCaﬁrey- and .Bob Covey,
workers‘; and Lee Mclnerney and
Russ "Robinson, publicity. '

J A pledge program will be in-
cluded in Pitt’s drive. Under this
plan a student -may pledge his
donation, then make payment as
late as November 30. Any.defer-
red donation will be payable in
the Treasurer’s ofﬁce of the Uni-
versity.

College‘Debate

Speed-Up Plan

Should colleges adopt the army’s
wartime speed-up methods of ed-

ucation or stick to the old sys- .

_tem of four years of college work?
In the new plan students are

tested at the beginning of the

semester and are allowed to carry.
more’ courses if they are. able.

According to the Daily Athen-
West Virginia university
newspaper, most colleges are not
enthusiastic about this plan. Al-
though many students are waiting
to enter, they maintain that a stu-
dent absorbs more over a longer
period of time and is more cap-
able of bearing adult responsibil-
ities. ‘ V

A nine-man commission, under
the American Council on Educa-
tion, is studying both plans and
will make a report in 1947.

Party For Soph «Women
To Follow Howdy Hop

Sophomore women will - make
October 29 a big day. Immediately
after the Howdy Hop they will
go to 6 o’clock dinner as guests
of the sophomore class cabinet.
From 7 until 9, hostesses of the
evening will entertain their class-
mates on the 12th floor of the
Cathedral at a party tabbed the
Sophomore Surprise.

Barbara Shropp, program chair-
man, refuses to reveal any details
about the plans for the even_ing’5
festivities.

All sophomore women are ask-
ed to pay 50 cents for class dues.
This amount will defray expenses
of the’7.Sophom.ore Surprise. “

Date Bureau
Inaugurated  

At Purdue .

Are you ‘having a tough time
getting dates? Is that blonde in
American lit. still the unknown
Miss X to you? If so, Purdue, uni-
versity has the solution to your
problem; And the answer isn’t a
super Mr.vAnthony. .

Purdue’s plan is this: The ac-
tivitiesbureau, realizing the dull-

ness of college life minus dates, is .

organizing an all-campus date
bureau. With the increased enroll-
ment at Pitt, a similar bureau
could be adopted so that every
co-ed can meet her seven men. (It

is rumored the ratio is seven men .

to every girl). Besides, the men
complain that competition is
rough so a. date bureau would
give every man an equal chance.

The bureau at Purdue follows

this proceedure. The applicant
ﬁlls out a ‘small? car’ with his
name, phone number, color of

hair, height, whether or not he
dances, and his preferences, such
as blonde,’ brunette, tall, or short.
The only kind of date the bureau
will make are “coke” dates. This
is the beginning and it is up to
the‘ “daters” to ‘carry on.

This plan especially serves
those who live in private room-
ing houses and have no outside
social connections. _

What about such-a system at
Pitt? Perhaps some energetic
group of individuals will
about divising such a plan.

Alldred /Room
Gets Books

Rumor has it that there isn’t

enough of certain things around
the University this semester -
things like lockers, parking space,
textbooks, room in the Tuck shop,
etc., etc.

‘No matter what happens, the
Alldred room always seems to
come through with a supply of
new’ and interesting books.

One of the ﬁrst new texts of
interest to students and faculty is
“Celebration,” a book of poems
by Hoyt Hudson, who was for-
merly at the University. Another
book for poetry fans is Oscar
Williams’ “Little Treasury of
Mo-dern Poetry.”

In the biography department,
the new books include selections
for widely different tastes —- all
the way from Haskell Parson’s
“Oscar Wilde, his Life and Wit”
to Margery Miller’s “Joe Louis,
American.”

For those internationally-mind-'

ed, there is “I Saw the Russian
People” by Ella Winter, “The Dis-
covery of India” by Nehru, and a
Frenchman’s View of the ‘English,
“The English Way” by Pierre
Maillard.

New novels include “The Dark
Wood” by Christine Weston, “Red

Morning” by Ruby Vey, and
“There Were Two Pirates” by
James Branch Cabell. “Animal

Farm,” by George Oswell, is a
tale involving a group of animals
on a Mr. Jones’ farm,iwho revolt
and set up a democracy.

Exchange Closes Today

The Men’s Council Book ex-
change closes today until next
spring. Students who have money
or used books due them must pick
them up between one and four
p. rn. on the eighth ﬂoor. Any
books that are not taken will be
held and placed on sale next sem-
ester.

Things look bad. Last week we
came out with a dazzling new
title, but someone screamed —
fraternity does not include Sor-
ority and here we are with a col-
umn entitled Fraternally Speaking
with stuff in it about sororities.
Do we have trouble! What do you

(think? Should we cut all news

about sororities and gyp Abby out

of an opportunity to get her name
in the by-line, or should we
change the name of the feature
(term used loosely) to “Inter-
Hellenish Dope” or something?

To add to our troubles, the frats
are saving their energy and brains
for rushing and give us no news.
What a dilemma! The only saving

Thru The Roster

Veteran Ends Shine

By Bob De Lotto

In a starting lineup that fea-
tures six freshmen, Wesley Fes-
ler, the new Jungle Cat 1e er, is
probably most fortiﬁed at_-t e end
slots. Here he has been able to
ﬂourish the agile Leo Skladany
and Bill McPeak, both of whom
are serving their second term for
the Blue and Gold squad. Skla-
dany, who was the victim of sev-
eral early season injuries, ﬁnally
came into his own in the Mar-
quette fracas when he snatched in
a pass for Pitt’s lone and winning
touchdown.

McPeak’s grid career was in-‘

terrupted by a service hitch, but
he has come back stronger than
burly 185

He has also been a threat on of-
fensive plays by catching many
important passes. -

Another rising star in the Fes-
ler terminal setup is husky Wal-

ter Cummings. This is Walt’s sec-

ond year at the Oakland sky-
scraper although it is only his
ﬁrst term on the squad. Following
his opening game fitters against
Illinois, Walt has s aped up as a
very good end prospect. ' I '

Other hustling ﬂankers are Bill
Mihm, John Gregg, Charles Dow-
ler, Clements Schneider, and
Frank Capello. Of this quintet,
Mihm has seen considerably more
action than the others. .

Ed note: This is the ﬁrst of a
series of five articles on the vari-
ous positions of‘ the Pitt grid team.

.years. Thi_s triumph should set the Olsonites

.  in 24lKa.a':t 24/lay . .

by Al Roth
Sports Editor

Circle The Date . _
Saturday, _October 19, may well go down into Pitt sport
annals as a red letter day. On that ideal_ fall day, two Panther
athletic groups came through with real, ‘live v1ctor1es——a rare
occurence during those‘ lean war years and since. _ . .
The Jungle Cat Victory over Marquette On the g1'1d11‘°n

— and the cross-country win over Case both came during oppor-

tune occasions. Forthe gridders it was ample
proof that with -some semblance of an offense
they can rightly expect their share of victories .
———even this year. 3- _
I It was quite a gratifying experience for ..
Carl Olson andhis harriers to cop the ﬁrst
meet’ that Pitt has participated in for ﬁve

  

in the proper frame of mind" as they embark
on their remaining SIX meet card.

Panther Ponyback * .

When Jack Smodic suddenly entered the
fray last Saturday afternoon, many fans were visibly disap-
pointed. Those that were not too familiar vvitli‘-* the Cat’s
roster expected a hard driving back of Hal Stebbins propor-
tions or with the shake—loose attributes of a Cassiano. Smodic
is much too tiny to be either.

The former German Township ace is rather boyish, both
in appearance and in physical makeup, weighing only 160

' pounds. In the few spot situations in which he appeared
against Marquette he proved that he has the makings of a
good back. ‘i

Lee

Special Delivery Style ’ .

Bobby Lee’s pitching in the last game really set hearts
palpitating at -a terriﬁc pace. Lee tossed passes from almost every
conceivable position, even completing one while running back-

- wards with half the Marquette line wound around him. Lee,

like Smodic, carries the ball well and with his added poundage
can grind out plenty of drive. _ »

Ripe For Upset

With Lee or Smodic in the tailback spot plus Bill Bruno,

Abraham, and DePasqua or Cecconi ﬁlling out the backﬁeld

_ the Panthers are in excellent position to match the Boiler-

makers yard for yard. If the Pitts can fool the dope-sheet

and tumble Purdue it will be the ﬁrst ‘victory for’ a Pitt
team over a Western Conference opponent since 1938.

 

Hopes To Surprise
Improved Riveters

Pitt’s maturing Panthers — hot
on the comeback trail -- play host
to the Purdue Boilermakers at the
Stadium tomorrow.

For a team which has lost three,
tied one, and squeaked out a‘ nar-
row one touchdown verdict over
a minor opponent, Purdue comes
here highly touted.

Cecil Isbell, Boilermaker coach,
may start Bob Pfohl at one of the

"halfback berths. Previously, it was

believed that Pfohl was sidelined
for the season. Bob DeMoss, al-
though favoring an injured shoul-
der, will alternate with Johnny
Galvin at quarterback.

Galvin, left-footed punter, sav-
ed the day for Purdue with a
booming 64-yard kick in the dy-
ing minutes of the Ohio State
game. Shifty Ken Smock will
check in at left half. Ed Cody,_ who
regained his 1945 form and dash-
ed for two tallies last Saturday,
will be at fullback.

Coach Isbéll substitutes his line-
men according to the defensive
situation and where he thinks
they will be most effective. Dick
Barwegen, guard on the unde-
feated ’43 eleven, has been out-
standing. Bob Heck and Norm
Maloney ﬂank a line which aver-
ages 212 pounds.

The Pitt backﬁeld will show
Lee and Smodic alternating at
left half. Bill Bruno shifts to
fullback. DePasqua and Cecconi
will share the signal-calling du-
ties. Bill Abraham remains at

right half. Guard Bill Coury and

Tackle Bob Plotz, who missed the
Marquette battle, will return to
the lineup against Purdue.

Junior Varsity Cllrb
Meets Navy Plehes
This Afternoon

Led by Coaches Rudy Gradisek
and Ralph Mitterling, Pitt’s junior
varsity—-33 strong-—invade .An-
napolis to battle the Naval‘ acad-
emy “B” team today.

  
  
 
  
  
  
 
  
  
   
 
  
   
 
  
   
 
  
 
  

This afternoon's contest .will
mark the resumption of a series
which was interrupted in 1943,‘
following a 46 to C16 triumph by
the junior Middies.

In their ﬁrst test this season,
the junior Panthers were snowed
under, 32 to 3 by the Ohio State‘:
“jayvees”. The Naval academy
“B” eleven has compiled an en-”.
viable record thus far. "

The Panther’s probable lineup
will show ‘Schneider and Dowler
at the ends; Cerrone and Darras’
at the tackle posts; Fred Thomas‘
at center, ﬂanked by guards Mat-
tioli and Cooper; Hrutkay calling
signals; Kennedy and Falcone at
the halves and Becker at full.

The “B” team’s next engage-
ment is scheduled for November

8 with Ohio State. The site for
this contest is undecided.

There will be a meeting of
all intramural team managers
on Monday, November 4 at
4:45 p. m. in the Trees Gym
athletic office.

Pitt Graduate
Researcher Dies

Margaret Laschinger, assistant
director 01‘ the University’s trop-
ical testing unit and recently-
appointed lecturer in biology, died
at her home Monday, October 21.

Immediately after graduation

Laschinger became the first full-
time research assistant in the his-
tory of the department of biolog-
ical sciences, under the grant
from the Buhl Foundation. At the
outbreak‘ of the war she began
working with the tropical testing
unit remaining with that project
until. her death.

Miss Laschinger, who gradu-
ated with highest honor, was
deeply interested in art. The
sampler in the Early American
room is an example of her em-
broidery. While an undergraduate
she was a theme reader in the
English A‘ department.
