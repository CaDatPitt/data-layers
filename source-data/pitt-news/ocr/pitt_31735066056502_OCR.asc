“There are serious problems

Holland. “Arbitrary decisions

According to Holland, people

AIDS session edacatesstudémgbe disease

By Cameron Harvey
Staff Writer

There are between 280 and 300 AIDS cases on the Pitt campus if

we go by national statistics, said Lynn Surrey, a trained psycholo-
gist and faculty member of Washington, Jefferson and California
University of Pennsylvania colleges.

“Nationally there have been over,“ 350,000 AIDS cases since 1981,
excluding those who are HIV positive but are not exhibiting the
symptoms of AIDS. For every full blown AIDS case, there are seven

of which we are unaware.

With this number, [the number of AIDS cases] breaks the two

"million.-mark,” Surrey said .at a question and answer session, spon-

sored by the Leisure Learning Program of the Pitt Program Council,

last 

Men between the ages of 30 to 35 make up the highest percent-
age of AIDS patients, according to Surrey. People between 20 and
25 are the highest risk group in the country.

Surrey said that seven percent of AIDS patients in America are
heterosexual and then compared that to the rest of the world
where 70 percent of the AIDS patients are heterosexuals. Surrey
attributed this large numerical discrepancy to the fact that AIDS
was originally transmitted through the gay and IV drug—using pop-

After N emacolin debacle, Allocations revised retreat policy

By Sam Gresock
Staff Writer

(Editor’s Note.- This is the sec-
ond-part of a two part series
looking into the Student
Government Board’s
Allocations Committee.)

Last year’s Student
Government Board leadership
retreat lasted only one week-
end, but its effects lingered for

long afterwards.

A much-publicized student
outcry ensued after word got
out that the SGB spent an esti-
mated $9,000 on a weekend trip
to Nernacolin Woodlands resort
early last January.

The controversy resulted in
the necessity for a major policy
change regarding retreat-fund-
ing procedures. “It seemed the
whole campus reacted, and
there were a lot of shock waves,

so we had to do something
about it,” SGB Allocations Chair
Damian Cevallos said.

As chair of -the SGB’s
Allocations Committee, Cevallos
has overseen the making of
such a policy, in addition to
managing approximately
$400,000 in activities funds for
Pitt’s student organizations.

On Oct. 15, 1993, the SGB
approved the new funding poli-
cy which limits provisions for

retreats to one night and a maxi-
mum allotment of $150 per per-
son for food and lodging.
According to Cevallos, the poli-
cy came about almost directly as
a result of students’ reaction to
last year’s controversial retreat.
“I think the whole thing hap-
pened because there was such a
large student response,” he said.
“A lot of people seemed to
think that Allocations was just
overspending their money and

there was no one watching
them.

“I felt that now was a good
time [to do this] and I wanted to
show that I am listening to stu-
dents’ concerns,” he added.

This year’s retreat will be held
in January at the Courtyard
Marriott and will cost $3,855.
According to Cevallos, the
amount falls within the funding
policy’s $150-per-person guide-

and expect reprisals if [they]
voice [their] opinions for pos-
sible improvements in the
school that do not reﬂect the
administration’s desires.”
Also, 58 replied they had lit-
tle or no confidence “in Dr.
Suzuki’s leadership capabili-
ties.”

When asked about ques-
tions surrounding Suzuki’s
reorganization, Holland said,
“The process was not used
well.” He cited confusion
surrounding the dental
school’s planning and budget
committee’s approval of the
administrative reorganization
this past summer.

Carey Balaban, a faculty
member in otolaryngology at
Pitt’s medical school, said if
procedure was not followed
during the reorganization,
the dental school faculty has
a legitimate complaint which
should be brought to the
administration’s attention.

Holland said he was
hoping to set up a private

meeting between Chancellor-

J. Dennis O’Connor
and dental school faculty
-“where the identity of faculty
participants would be
privileged information”
in order to improve commu-
nication between faculty
and administration mem-
bers.

“It is clear to me that the
issue of governance within
the dental school is not the
only issue that needs to be

dealt with,” Ginsburg said.
“There were a number of
statements on the question-
naires suggested that to some
extent  other administrative
structures at this university
need to be examined as
well.”

According to Holland, he
raised the issue. of dental
school faculty involvement to
O’Connor and Pitt Health
Sciences Senior Vice
Chancellor Thomas Detre at
a luncheon last month, but
said‘ their response was
“strongly negative.”

-In related news, the
Faculty Assembly unani-
mously adopted resolutions
of confidence in Holland as
their president, as well as
similar resolutions concern-

~ ing Pitt ‘professors Barbara

Shore and Richard Tobias.

Interim Provost Mark
Nordenberg’ criticized a
report submitted by|Shore
and Tobias as “grossly
unfair” at a Senate Council
meetingtlast month

At the same_ meeting, Detre
blasted Holland’s support
of Dr. Norman Wolmark,
who was asked to resign as
chief of surgery at the
University of Pittsburgh
Medical Center.

“It is clear he was set up by
UPMC,” Holland ‘said. “The
situation at UPMC needs to
be fixed.” '

Ginsburg said the resolu-
tion was intended to send a
message to the Pitt adminis-

tration about the “attack on
the credit of our colleagues.”
“It is important not

to recede into the wood- ,

work because of the threat
that someone may publicly
attack you  if your views
are different than certain
administrators,” Ginsburg
said. .

-Earlier in the meeting, a
letter was passed out which
indicated O’Connor’s positive
response to Senate Council’s

modifications to the Research

Integrity Policy, except for a
statement . concerning

whether or not formal hear-

ings should be open to the
public.

According to the letter,
O’Connor said the open
hearing of Dr. Herbert
Needleman should be left as
an exception to the rule.

Holland said when
the subject was Voted upon
before Senate Council
and full Senate, the
vote results ,were over-
whelmingly in favor of open
hearings.

“I think it is an unhappy,
unfortunate situation,”
Holland said. “Openness
makes a big difference.”

Nathan Hershey, afaculty A
member in Health Services,

said when considering the
question of open hearings,
the committee shou_ld'take
into consideration whether

or not the complainant has .

already taken allegations to
the media. 3

ulation. “The heterosexual per-
centages will match the world
percentages soon.”

“Talking about sex is the only
weapon that we have. Telling
people not to have sex is like
telling people not to have
food,” Surrey said. “Value—sys-
tern teaching is our next gener-
ation of AIDS education.”

“We have learned to talk to
people about their own value
systems. Decide what your val-
ues are ahead of time and stick
to them. Ask yourself, ‘What am

«II going to do to protect

myself?” Surrey said.

“Don’t only ask if you’ve
used a condom, ask when was
the last time you’ve used a con-
dom,” he said. “Condoms don’t
break if you use them right. live
put them over my head  they
don’t break.

Surrey also mentioned that
oral sex is not on the list of
dangerous ‘activities in any
country now other than the
United States. “Yes if your
mouth is bleeding and your
partner’s ‘mouth is bleeding,
then it is possible. But other
than that, the chances are astro-
nomically high.”

The group least likely to con-
tract the AIDS virus is lesbians,
according to Surrey. “Lesbian
women have no closed body
environments [for the AIDS
virus to survive in], hence. the
low percentage of AIDS.”

’According to Surrey, there
should not have been any con-
troversy over Magic Johnson’s
playing in the Olympics last
year. “The chances of Magic
getting cut and bleeding all
over the place, then finding
another player in the same con-
dition to mix ‘his blood with are
extremely low. Plus the fact that
oxygen kills the AIDS virus
makes the chance of contract-

ing AIDS astronomically high,”

he said. A

According to Surrey, AIDS
patients are in much more dan-
ger of getting sick from you
then you are from them.
Parents who are afraid that their
children will get AIDS from an
infected classmate don’t realize
that their own children have
colds and illnesses that will get
these children sick. “The AIDS
virus doesn’t kill you, other ill-
nesses kill you.” _ "

lines. -

Cevallos said the funding poli-
cy only applies for retreats held
by the SGB and Pitt’s gover-
nance groups. “Non-governance
groups aren’t allowed to have
retreats funded for,” he said. “It
would just get too expensive.”

According to Cevallos, the
amount of research involved in

A devising a retreat policy made

the process take so long.

“Going back through the old
accounts, ﬁnding out where [the
groups] spent the money and
contacting all the places took a
lot of time,” he said.

“It took a lot of time but I’m
really happy with what we
accomplished.” .

This year’s SGB leadership
retreat, like those of other gov-
ernance groups, will not include
all people involved in the orga-
nization. Cevallos said gover-
nance groups’ officers and stu-
dents who serve the organiza-
tions in higher positions will be

invited.

“We’re not going to take the
entire groups but we are going
to take the people at the top,”
Cevallos said. “It’s usually the
same people and the same posi-
tions every year that get to go
along.”

Cevallos also said that SGB
President Jacob Brody’s effort
to take along some different
people and positions to last
year’s retreat ultimately led to
the much-discussed controver-
sy. - ‘
“The reason for the price
increase [in last.year’s retreat]
was that Jacob invited a lot of
people because he wanted
everyone involved,” he said. “Is
that right? Is that wrong? Who’s
really to say?”

According to Cevallos, the
retreats are a great way for orga-
nizations to begin the new year
on the right foot.

“It’s nice to get away and cre-
ate a bond within the commit-
tee,” he said.

“If you don’t have an ef-
fective committee that works
well you will not be produc-
tive.” I

Cevallos said getting away
from Pitt and the busy surround-
ings of Oakland helps student
groups focus on their items of
business.

“If [the retreat] were held in

_ the William Pitt Union, you’d

show up, do your work -and
leave and go off and do your
own thing," he said.

While this year’s upcoming
retreat will take the SGB away
from Pitt for just one night,
Cevallos said he feels the board
can accomplish much during
the weekend. ‘

“[A one—night retreat] can still
be effective,” Cevallos said. “It
just means we’ll have to go
there, bond, do our work and
then leave and bring some of
the work back home with 

“But at least we have the
opportunity to do that,” he
added.

On my honor...?

On Monday, the Supreme Court upheld the Boy
Scouts of America’s right to refuse to accept agnostic
boys into their organization. Appeals by a ten—year-old
boy and his father who wanted to join a Chicago Boy
Scout pack were rejected by the court on the grounds
that the Boy Scouts of America is a private club.

According to the Philadelphia Inquirer, the Scouts
“are not a ‘place’ of public accommodation, and even
if the nationwide organization were, it still would be
excluded from the federal anti—discrimination law
because it is a private club.”

However, the Boy Scouts tout themselves as an orga-
nization which is open to all. As a public organization,
they should not exclude people on the basis religious
preference. Religious preference includes being agnos-
tic.

They are a non-profit organization which receives
tax breaks under these auspices. If they are going to
have the perks of being such an organization, then
they should provide the opportunities which are inher-
ent in the description. ,

If they want to have the ability to exclude people on
the basis of religious preference and keep their tax sta-
tus, then they should declare themselves as a religious
organization and accept the tax codes which apply to
such organizations.

The other problem with this exclusion is that the Boy
Scouts claim to be raising “good citizens.” They make
believing in a god prerequisite to being a good citizen.

At the heart of the matter is the oath which the
Scouts are required to memorize and recite. This oath
includes the phrase “to do my duty to God and my
country.” This phrase establishes the requirement that
to be a good citizen, one must believe in a god. The
oath is the central tenet of the organization, no one
can get into the group with out reciting it. ,

The message sent by this is religious intolerance. The
idea that someone should be of the same faith in order
to be included in a group is outrageous. It begins to
breedreligious intolerance among the youths involved
in this organization. This seems to conﬂict with their
goal of raising “good” citizens.

Tradition should not be used as an excuse to perpet-
uate discrimination. Too often, prejudice has been

practiced in the name of tradition. This is how doors '

are closed under the auspices of membership require-
ments. Too much done in the name of tradition begins
to breed xenophobia.

It is time for the Boy Scouts to reexamine their
rhetoric and grow tolerant. If they truly want to teach
young boys to be good citizens, then acceptance‘ ‘of
others and respect of different religious beliefs should
be more important than who lists “believer ir1 god”_on
their application and who does not.

One may find that the battle
of the sexes is reaching a boil-
ing point over many feminist
issues after reading" Tony

Dickensheets’ Perspective col-'

umn on Dec. 2. Catherine
Mackinnon’s book No Words is
obviously a ludicrous attack on
men instead of an evaluation of
the treatment of women.
Although the author of the
book expressed her ideas
poorly, Mr. Dickensheets vent-
ed more hostility than intelli-
gence. Mr. Dickensheets proba-
bly shares the anger that most
men feel over the “man bash-
ing” that many feminists use to
explain their points. Stating

opinions by attacking others '

doesn’t accomplish anything,
and unfortunately this method
is prevalent in the feminist
movement.

I am a member of Pitt’s
Campus Woman’s
Organization, and I can say
that I share disgust with the

,men of Pitt’s campus when I

see “Dead men don’t rape"
chalked on university property.
I hope that male students over-
look this and think about the
problem of sexual assault in
our society with an open mind.

I feel I must address the idea
of victimization of women
through sexual assault.
Feminists today debate about
whether increasing awareness
about domestic abuse and sex-
ual violence is accomplishing
nothing but portraying women
as helpless and inferior. One
must realize this is a demand
for recognition of the problem.
The statistics of violence

Rape victim not powerless or weak

number? If I even talk about

against women, however
shocking, have validity and
should not be taken lightly.

As a feminist and a rape vic-
tim (yes, I was a victim), I feel
that the down playing of sexu-
al assault hurts. It would be
ignorant of me, or anyone, to
say that women are not victim-
ized by sexual assault and
domestic violence. For in these
situations, men possess superi-
or physical strength which

Mollie Beth
-Kraeling

‘enables them to commit the

crime. Logically, women are

inferior in those situations.
Having been a rape victim, I

must say that it did not make

me weak and powerless. -

Talking about it openly and
striving to" educate others
instead of being ashamed has
been empowering. However,
trying to educate people is very
frustrating. Since transferring to
Pitt this semester, I must say
that I was very disappointed in
the lack of interest in programs
such as Take Back the Night
and Sexual Assault Awareness
Day. As I stood outside of the
student union on Awareness
Day, I desperately tried to pass
out hotline numbers for
women to use if they are a vic-
tim of rape and I_ was met with
hostile glances. Why wouldn’t
a female _student want this

my experience, people act as if

they are embarrassed for me.

This is the attitude that keeps
women from talking openly
and being able to empower
themselves to make a differ-
ence. I don’t get involved in
these programs because I hate
men, rather, I do it because I
might have a daughter some-
day, as many of the students

on this campus, both male and ’

female, may as well. It is my
hope that more men join the
fight to stop the victimization
of women, as it is the actions
of some men that have ruined
the image of males in our soci-
ety.

Just because I try to increase
awareness about sexual vio-
lence, men should not feel as if
they have to defend themselves
when talking about the issue.

In closing, I would like to
say that I resent the idea that
just because I am a victim I
should feel inferior. I’ am not
an “unsubstantiated and exag-
gerated” statistic. I am living
proof that victims can have the
strength to fight for the respect
and dignity that women
deserve. Ignorance is weak-
ness. Knowledge of society’s
problems and possessing the
strength and courage to make a
difference for others is power.

Mollie Beth Kraeling is a
junior who hopes to enter law
school and eventually prosecute

sex crimes. The Pittsburgh -

ual assault. The number is 765-

The drought has finally
ended.

No palm trees, rum or hula-
clad women provided a‘ back-
drop for Pitt’s first Jamaican win
over St. John’s, in their last five
tries —- only some street lights,
a battalion of cops and a hand-
ful of 40’s, as Pitt’s sloppy-yet-

6 effective 75-68 decision over the

Redmen pushed the Panther’s
Big East record to a perfect 2-0
on the short season.

“It’s nice going into Christmas
break knowing that you’re at
least even with everybody else
[in the Big East],” Evans said of
his squad’s first win over the
Redmen in New York City since
January 30, 1989 — an 85-81
decision. '

Panther forward Chris Gant
continued his sizzling play with
another double-double — 11

. points and 11 rebounds — as

Pitt survived with what hardly
was a textbook victory.

The Panthers blewan 11-
point lead with only 2:06 left
and still barely held on to beat
the turnover—happy Redmen in
a- game that, near the finale,
became the antithesis of sound,
fundamental basketball.

Host St. John’s turned the ball
over a total of 19 times and shot

8 i a paltry 32 percent in the sec-

ond half against a surprisingly
accurate Pitt squad (50 percent
— '29—of-58 from the ﬂoor.)

Part of the reason for St.

The Steelers’ so-called “big”
wins are looking smaller and

A smaller everyday. Those victo-'

ries that were supposedly sym-
bolic of Pittsburgh’s rise to join
the elite teams in the NFL don’t
look so big these days.

The win over New Orleans
looked like a huge win at the
time. The Saints were 5-0, and
cruising. But the Steelers man-
aged to exploit the weakness
that Jim Mora-coached teams
always seem to have: the
offensive scheme is pathetic.

Very little deep routes and a
lot of running. Boring and very
predictable. The Steelers pres-
sured Wade Wilson and
jammed everybody at the line.
The boys from the Bayou went
down with the ship 37-14.
They are now 7-5 and may not
make the playoffs.

This is the point in the season

continuing effectiveness of Pitt’s
2-3 zone defense. After holding
the Providence perimeter game
in check during the second half
in their Big East opener
Saturday, Evan’s decision to" go
back to the zone bottled up tal-

ented SJU center Shawnelle

Scott and the rest of the
Redmen’s inside game, and
allowed the Panthers to fall
back around the forwards.

“I thought the defense down '

' comparing the Steeler defense
to the famed “Steel Curtain” of
the ‘70s. Do you think some of

tle prematurely? Fans were

home field advantage.

Since that magical evening
however, the Steelers have
been toasted by Denver,
Houston and nearly New
England. The 8-4 Bills have
been on the verge of collapse.
Buffalo can’t score and has a
game next week at Philly that
is no guarantee. They aren’t
even the best team in their
division — yet alone the AFC.

Speaking of tough games,

the stretch was very, very
good,” Evans said.

But despite the poor shoot-
ing, the Redmen were allowed
back into the game with a bend-
but—d0n’t—break performance by
the Panthers down the stretch.

Up 69-60 with 1:39 remaining,
SJU’s Fred Lyson drained a
three—pointer and Carl Beckett
hit a lay—up to cut the lead to
four.

After Pitt’s Jaime Peterson hit

the Steelers have one next
week. Pittsburgh must beat
Miami on Monday night to stay
within striking distance of
Houston. The Dolphins are 9-3
and will be charged by the
return of heroic QB Scott
Mitchell. Let’s hope Barry
Foster returns. If he doesn’t,
the season may be lost.

-Here’s something to think
about. Imagine Rod Woodson
20 years from now, sitting
around a campfire on a chilly
October night telling scary sto-
ries to his grandchildren.

One could have went as fol-
lows: “The horrible Patriots

the second of two foul shots,
the Redmen’s Derek Brown
canned a pull-up three to slice
the advantage to two — the
closest St. John’s would get for
the rest of the evening.

Panther ' guard Ahmad
Shareef, normally the starting
off-guard, was forced into point
duties late in the game because
starting one-man Jerry
McCullough picked up his fifth
foul — a technical assessed for
hanging on the rim. Despite the
change of positions, Shareef
came through scoring four of
his ten points from the foul line
(four—of—four) in the final sec-
onds. -
“Maybe losing those two exhi-
bition games wasn’t so bad,”
Evans said. “It got Shareef some
time at the point. He made
some big free throws down the
stretch.”

McCullough led the team with
12 points and eight assists.
Fellow New Yorkers Orlando
Antigua and Peterson had nine
and eight points respectively.

Pitt center Eric Mobley contin-
ued to struggle, scoring only
eight points while grabbing
seven boards and swatting three
shots. He sat most of the second
half as Peterson logged 20 min-
utes, hitting four of six free

' throws — all in the waning min-

utes.

“Eric;s been working hard,”
Evans said. “He watched a lot of
film, did a lot of studying. I
don’t know what it was -4 he
may have been too anxious in
his last game at home.”

That may have been the case
with about 50 percent of the
team. With six players‘ hailing
from New York City, Evans had
a tough time keeping the emo-
tions of the group in check.

Staf/‘Writer

As the Pitt men were winning
the Pitt Invitational and the Pitt
women were placing third last
weekend at Trees Pool, part of
the swimmingteams’ points
were boosted by another
source.

No, they were not receiving
any divine intervention, the Pitt
men’s and Women’s diving
teams were just dominating
opponents as both have all sea-
son.

Last weekend, Pitt divers won
all four diving events and in
doing so, scored major points
by placing all of its divers in the
ﬁnals of the events.

At last weekend’s Pitt
Invitational, the Pitt men domi-
nated the field, and first-year
diver John Soulakis was unbeat-
able in both diving competi-
tions. '

Soulakis beat out teammate
Jeremy McClean for the one-
meter title, while senior captain
Sean Braud, diving for the first
time this season, was the run-
ner—up in Soulakis’ three-meter
victory. ‘ .,

Head diving coach Julian
Krug said Soulakis is having a
great year thus far.

“John Soulakis has been
everything that we hoped he
would be this season,” Krug
said.

“He has been improving
markedly in areas that we need-
ed to improve throughout the
course of the season, and he is
on track to make NCAA’s and to
do some things even in his

freshman year.”

“I am very pleased with his
progress, and his presence on
the team has had a positive
impact on his other teammates.”

Thesuccess of Soulakis has
been especially important as
Braud had been sidelined for
six weeks leading up to this
past weekend’s meet.
Sophomore Jeremy McClean
has also responded well to the
team’s injuries, continuing with
another strong season thus far.

The two have been instru-
mental in helping lead the
men’s team to a perfect 5-0
dual—meet record thus far,
which included an upset of
perennial power Virginia last
month in Charlottesville.

“They have just been filling

.the shoes of me not being_

there,” Braud said. “They’ve
stepped it up, and have been
performing phenomenally.”

But Krug said it was nice to
see Braud back on the boards.

“I was delighted to have Sean
Braud back, and it is very
important for Sean and the team
for him to be back and doing
something,” Krug said.
“The attitude with which he did
it, he competed and per-
formed, actually, quite well.”

“The fact that he got through
two full lists and had nothing
close to any injury clearly was a
lift to himself, a lift to the team
and a lift all the way around for
me as well,” Krug added.

“As a coach, you have con-
cerns about a senior athlete

.who misses six weeks, but my

hands were tied.”

On the Women’s side, junior
Kara Sixbury and sophomore
Sunday ' Lewandowski contin-
ued their assault on opponents
with a victory in each of the
events. .

Sixbury won the one-meter
competition as Lewandowski
placed third, while the two
ﬂip-ﬂopped in the three-meter
eventwith: Lewandowski tak-
ing first-place honors. ,

As Pitt’s top two divers,
Sixbury and Lewandowski are
hoping to surpass their success

of a year ago, when they both
advanced to the NCAA champi-
onships, which feature the top
30 collegiate divers in the
nation.

Krug said he is impressed
with his top two divers’ perfor-
mances so far this season.

“We are really very much
where I want them to be in cer-
tain ways,” Krug said. “Clearly
in this competition each won
one board and both won handi-
ly."

“The rest of our kids dove
very consistently and steadily;
all four women fmaled on both
boards,” King said.

“We still have a lot of work to
do for a very very good champi-
onship end of the year, and
that’s what we’re shooting for,”
Krug said.

“I’d say overall we are not far
off from where we want to be.
The kids are doing a pretty nice
job.”

Braud said the women are
headed for success come March
and the NCAA zone qualifying
meet in Annapolis, Md.

“I believe Kara and Sunday
have an extremely great chance
of making NCAA’s again,”
Braud said. “They are pretty
much the two top divers in our
zone, and as long as they keep

drns vie for recognition

their heads on straight, they’re
headed back to NCAA’s.”

As for himself and his male
counterparts, Braud said
Soulakis, McClean and himself
all have their sights set on mak-
ing the NCAA’s for the first time.

“It will be who wants it more,
and there’s no question that the
desire is there for all of us,”
Braud said.

Braud said this desire was
strong, despite the fact that at
meets like last weekend’s, too
often the team’s contributions
are overlooked, mainly by the
people in the stands.

“I don’t think it gets over-
looked by our teammates as
much as it does by the specta-
tors,” Braud said. “A lot of peo-
ple don’t realize how physically
and mentally trying it is.”

Men’s swimming head coach
Chuck Knoles said that with all
the swimming events in a typi-
cal meet, fans think that they
are getting a break during the
diving events.

“We sometimes ignore what’s
going on over there because we
are pounding ‘back and forth
with races,” Knoles said. “The
vast majority of the crowd
comes to watch the swimmers

because there are more of

them.”

“But the sport is called swim-
ming and diving, and very deﬁ-
nitely in our program we take
that into account,” Knoles said.

“Ever since I’ve been here
they’ve been a very positive
factor toward the number of
wins that end up in my column
 I’ve appreciated that.”

As for this concern over not
respect for the diving program,
Krug stressed that swimming
and diving are entirely different
sports.

“The athletes don’t under-
stand each other in the training
that they do and in the activities
that they do,” Krug said.

“On this team there is a great
deal of respect back and forth,
and I believe the swimmers do
respect what they are doing.”

“They watch them train every-
day and they know it is not of
the painful variety. The pain is
of a psychological and a physi-
cal variety,” Krug said.

“It is very different, in the
swimmers’ own minds. If they
imagine being upside down div-
ing and landing wrong in the
water, it wouldn’t be much fun,”
Krug said.

‘ “By the same token, divers

don’t want to swim lap after‘

lap.»

Recruiting and
improved facilities
will make or break

football at Pitt  

By Jack Becker
Staff Writer

(Part two of a series on rebuilding
Pitt football)

 Let me not defer or neglect it 

With Coach John Majors and Athletic

‘ Director Oval Jaynes combining their

efforts, Pitt has solidified the primary
steps in the rebuilding of the football
program.

But it takes more than just capable

A people in powerful positions.

Pitt craves new facilities.

“It is important to enhance athletic
facilities and build new ones,” Jaynes
said.

Majors said Pitt needs an upgraded
athletic training facility for the care and
prevention of injuries, it needs a better
academic support area for athletes -
one that is conducive to study, it needs
better coaches rooms — and most
importantly, it needs a larger, more
time-efficient weight room. All of this is
an integral chore in putting Pitt back in
competition with the elite of college
football.

“Right now, I’d say we’re in the bot-
tom 5 percent in the country,” Majors’

, said of Pitt’s current facilities.

The improvements are all still in the

discussion stage, but jaynes said archi-
tects are,already looking at the area
inside Pitt Stadium between Gate 1 and
Gate 3 to build new training facilities.
That space includes the old gym and
thesurrounding area underneath the
stadium.
, Jaynes also said within the next cou-
ple of days he hoped to have prelimi-
nary planning sketches from the archi-
tects. * _

“We haven’t seen any plans yet to be
able to sit down with coaches and say

V ‘this is what we can do,”’ Jaynes said.

 
  

 

Pitt New File Pho

Oval Jaynes hopes facilities, recruiting add up to future football success.

Just how big do these plans need to
be and how much room is needed to
bring Pitt up to speed? Strength and
conditioning Coach Tim Wilson is a
1981 graduate of Nebraska. He knows

_ the full impact that Nebraska’s 30,000

square footage of training facility has
on the program. '
“Does it need to be the size of
Nebraska? No,” Wilson said. “Does it
need to be half that size? That would be
nice. Personally, I don’t think we have
the room for it, but again that comes

down to the architects.”

Wilson said there just isn’t enough
time to run 90 to 100 players through
the current facility in a day. This is
especially true during the season when
Wilson has only an hour to an hour
and a half to do just that.

“It is very important from a recruiting
standpoint,” Wilson said. “They come
in here and they see 4,500 square
footage and they go to West Virginia
and see 22,000 square feet and they go
to Nebraska or Georgia Tech, which

ier facility improvement on the
Pitt a_:— rnda is the convocation center,
which Jaynes would like to see built
near ti e stadium.

“More has been focused on the stadi-
um, but just as important is the convo— _
cation center,” Jaynes said. “I wouldn’t
put ore over the other. It’ll determine
at wh. level were going to be at over
the nc t couple years. .

“Yo can play the games in the street
or the Cathedral lawn. If that’s where
you V nt to play. If we want to com-
pete a. the highest level we have to
provide better facilities for our student-

has a
going
Anc

No matter which facility it is, Pitt had
better have a workable plan in effect
by the February signing period for high
school seniors.

 Let me do it now

Majors is a master recruiter. He is a
man full of enough entertaining stories
to convince most starry~eyed 18-year-
olds to join his program. He is a coach
who desperately wants to bring some
fresh horses to go along with the stable
of players already here.

Majors says Pitt will concentrate most
of its recruiting effort to the east of the
Mississippi and places like California
and Texas. But he stresses the need for
Pitt to score big with local recruits, too.

“I need to win in my own backyard
and I need to beat the people I’m going
against in my own backyard,” Majors
said. _

What the Panthers are hoping for-is
to land a couple of blue-chip recruits.

A player like quarterback Ryan
Clement might be nice, but he could
also prove elusive. Though not a local
product (Clement hailsfrom Denver,
Colorado), he is this year’s Ron Powlus.

Pitt is recruiting Clement, but then
again so is the rest of the bowl coalition
world. I

After a recruiting visit to Notre Dame,
Clement said, “I saw a huge lighted No.
1 sign  it sent chills up my spine.”

“We had some trouble
with the New.York City
kids trying to do more
than they could do,” he
said.

The Redmen were led
by Shawnelle Scott’s 20
points and seven
rebounds. James Scott
added 18 points and eight
boards. Brown finished
with ten points.

Pitt Notes:
McCul1ough’s six steals
vaulted him into sixth
place on Pitt’s all-‘time _
steals list. He has rung up
132, passing Demetreus
Gore’s 126. McCullough
stands behind only Curtis
Aiken (155), Sam Clancy
(161), Dwayne Wallace
(169), Darelle Porter (170)
and Carlton Neverson
(194)  Pitt shot 48 per-
cent in the first half then
an impressive 52 percent
in the secondto finish at
50 percent for the night

The Panthers out-
rebounded St. John’s 41-
37. Charles Minlend led
the Redmen with nine
boards The Panthers
were only 12-of-20 from
the foul line in the second
half and finished at 59
percent  Pitt forward
Will Cauley picked up a
technical for a tough foul
in the second half.
Brown, who was fouled
away from the ball, hit
both ends of a one-and-
one and one of the two
technicals.

echoed  Enough said.

°Back to the Dolphins and
linebacker Bryan Cox. This guy
was recently fined $10,000 for
making obscene gesturesat fans
in Buffalo. He also may_have to
pay the price for criticizing offi-
ciating in Sunday’s loss to New
York. His latest escapade may
be the worst. ’

Cox said he would follow the
lead of Cincinnati wide receiver
Carl Pickens and scream racial
slurs at Rod Woodson if he had
the chance.

“If he’s going to let it bother
him, so be it. I think it would 
help us win,” Cox said.

There is no place for this fool-
ishness in pro football or any
other sport. I will be disappoint-
ed and surprised if a classy guy
like Don Shula does not take
appropriate action.

Rebuilding

Continued from page 8

If and when Clement visits
Pitt, the “Hail to Pitt” mural that
looms over Pitt Stadium likely
will not hold his lungs in place
even for a second. This is what
Pitt is up against.

However, at Notre Dame,
even an extraordinary player
might not start until his junior or
senior year. It is no secret that
the Panthers need help and

playing time is Majors’ biggest

selling point.

“Vfhen we recruit better, we

get betteron the field and when
we are better on the field, we
recruit better. It’s an upward
spiral,” said Curt Cignetti, the
recruiting coordinator.
. “We’ve got everything in
place to have a good recruiting
year. It’s just a matter of going
out and beating the bushes.”

 For I shall not pass this
way again 1. ..

Majors has said this will be his
last coaching job, -no matter
how long it lasts. He is on his

. last go—round.

“Right now is a very critical

time for our university and
especially the athletic depart-
ment,” Jaynes said.

He’s right. It is a time where

‘the pendulum swings either

upward or downward. There is
no time for standing 

Despite the odds, however,
there is a belief by the people in
the program that they are at the
start of something special with
the right men to guide them.

The players are certainly
aware of it. '

“I’m laying the foundation,”
senior Doug Whaley said. “In a
couple years Pitt will be back
where we’re supposed to be.
I’m glad to be a part of what is
to come.”

Majors points to his desk and
tells of the letters people have
written him saying how proud
they are to see the team ﬁght-
ing. Majors said he believes the
team can ﬁght harder. I

At the conclusion of his ﬁrst
year, Majors assesses the situa-
tion: “From when I first saw the
team workout on the field, I
think we’re a little bit ahead.”

Diving
Continued from page 7
Krug said there was a time

when swimming and diving

teams were not a together
situation at all, and now that
has changed.

“I do believe that on this
team we are a team, and I
thinkthat is a very good and
healthy thing for all
involved,” Krug said. ’

“The entire environment
here is V a ‘cooperative,

relatively positive environ-

pulling for everybody.”

Knoles said he attributes
much of the success to Krug,
who is in his 15th season at
Pitt.

“I think throughout all the
changes we’Ve seen in the
program the last 15 years
that Julian has been here, I
think the one stable factor
has been Julian,” Knoles
said.

“Because of that, he has

» _ brought a sense of being

ment where everybody is

able to be successful under
adverse conditions as well as
being a success under great
conditions.” v _
“By far he's one of the best
diving coaches that I’ve ever
run into. He’s a motivator

and a leader,” Knoles said. I

“It’s a real credit to the uni-
versity to have him on our
staff.” ,

Krug said the team-unity
factor is underrated and cer-
tainly has, and will, play a
role in the tearn’s success.

“That is, without a ques-
tion, a positive aspect into
each person’s performance,
and I think that is going to
show _up this year and in the
future with the coaches that
we have right now,” Krug
said.

“That is a very positive

aspect, and I believe that
pulling together is an intan-
gible that creates happy
campers as performers and
competitors out there.”
