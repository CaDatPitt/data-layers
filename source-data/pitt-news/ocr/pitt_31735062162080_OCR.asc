Supplies Ho/ding Out in
Oakland Markets, Szobo

Bread stocks reveal some of the impact of the truckers’ strike Photo by
Redic

BY LARRY PANSINO

The independent truckers strike
has not yet had much of an effect
on the food supplies of Szabo food
service or supermarkets in Oak-
land, but another week of the strike
may cause some shortages.

Local Teamster union truck
drivers who deliver food from
hearby warehouses to the dormi-
tory cafeterias and Giant Eagle
outlets in Oakland are still working.
However, A&P markets are having
some difficulty in getting ship-
ments from their warehouses in
Cleveland and Altoona due to fear
of attack on the highways.

A manager at the Forbes Avenue
A&P said, “We got the stuff in our
warehouses, but the problem is
getting the trucks to deliver it. We
haven’t had the same truck driver
come in here twice yet (since the
strike .began). They're com-
plaining." 4

Another A&P spokesman said
only that the situation is “very
confusing" and if the strike is
settled this weekend, A&P will be
back to {normal shortly. .,  

 
 
  
 

.1 ported,

house shipment arrived that
morning.‘

Dick Dearden, director of the
Towers cafeteria for Szabo, re-
“The trucks are still
coming in so it hasn’t affected us at
all yet. There have been delays but
no shortages.

“I think if there is another week
(of the strike) then we’ll have
problems with delivery of fresh
produce and perhaps even meats.”

The manager of the Giant Eagle
market on Atwood Street said food
supplies will not begin to dwindle
in his store for at least another
week. “Our drivers haven’t had
any problems. They've been very
good about it,” explained manager
George Dauer.

“Orders are going through and
deliveries are being made. We are
low on fresh fruits and produce, but
people are buying more than
usual."

Tom Jaworski, assistant manager
at the Centre Avenue Giant Eagle,
felt even an indeﬁnite strike would
not have a serious effect on Giant
Eagle. “Seventy-ﬁve percent of
our warehouse supplies comehere

Gos Fomine Strikes Students

BY MATTHEW KAMBIC

As the truckers’ strike reaches
tentative agreement in Washing-
ton, Pitt’s commuting students
continue to feel the effects of the
gasoline shortage. Many who
normally drive to Oakland are
turning to crowded buses, while
others hitchhike or just stay home.
Tom Robb, a student who
normally commutes in his own car
from McKeesport, arrived for
classes yesterday with his gas tank
hovering near empty. “There was
one station open that I could find,”
he said, “and it was lined up for
blocks. If I make it home today I

think l’l1 stay home tomorrow.”
Keith McWilliams, who lives in
Penn Hills, was more fortunate. “I

filled up last week and still have
half a tank left. I own a VW.”

Bob Hersh, from the East End,
and John Mulroy from Swissvale
hitchhiked to class. “A guy from
Cleveland stopped for me,” said
Mulroy. “He had one-eighth of a
tank left and was riding around
looking for a place to fill up his tank
so he could get back to Cleveland.”

Some commuters reported hitch-
hiking wasn’t a good idea because
“some drivers just ﬁgure you’re
thumbing to save the gas in your
own car, and so it's harder to get a
ride.”

Many students used buses for
transportation. Some were regular
passengers while others were car
owners with no fuel for their

Schenley Parking Plon

Receives Pitt

BY RALPH HAURWITZ?

The feasibility

underground parking garage to

replace the metered parking in

Schenley Plaza was presented to

Pitt by the Pittsburgh Parking
Authority last Wednesday.

According to Joseph Dutton, Vice
Chancellor of Operations, the
study, which is not yet complete,
was discussed in great detail. No
decisions were made. ,

“We discussed cost figures,
economic feasibility, construction,
architecture, and three or four
schemes" for traffic circulation,"
said Dutton."

“This is a ‘cooperative effort
between" the City and the Univer-
sity. Since there are a lot of
unresolved questions--we are- stay-

ing very open-minded about the .

matter.” ,

When asked if such a parking
garage was needed, Dutton re-
plied, “l have some very severe
reservations.”

He was especially concerned as to
whether a garage would be useful
in the future, since everyone might

‘be traveling around via mass

transit. -

even know if you can make it home
tonight."

According to Dave Houston,
chairman of the Transportation
Steering Committee for Oakland
Development, Inc. [ODI], the
Oakland community will not be in
favor of an underground garage
unless they are persuaded it will
provide relief.

ODI, a_ coalition of 16 or 17
community organizations, is con-
cerned about the preservation of
Oakland.
‘ “Concerning parking, there is a
problem between students and
residents,” said Houston. “As it
stands now, students and workers
are constantly ﬂooding the Oakland
community with cars, congesting
the streets, and making it difficult
for residents to park.

“We’re worried about the way
things happen, though,” continued
Houston. “lt’s usually incre-
mental--a street is paved, a new lot

is created, etc. These nickel and '

dime things can change the whole
fabric of Oakland.”

ODI will meet with the Pittsburgh
Parking Authority, Pitt, and the

Department" of City Planning. fora -'

calls “the best student to come out

basic German, and will instruct
TA’s in methods and approach.
“The new language specialist will
be in charge of our two introductory
courses--German l and 2," says
Boggs. “These courses will stress
speaking and listening, the func-
tional aspects of the language."
“Ideally, at the end of German 1,
we should be able to place the
student on anywstreet in Germany
with few problems. After
successfully completing German 2.

the student should be prepared for’

placement into a German univer-
sity setting."

In addition, courses in reading
German and diverse independent
study options will operate under
Bogg’s direction._ He emphasizes
independent study is open to any
University student. '

With the new structure of the
department, Boggs hopes to attract
the non-major members of the Pitt
community. “Although our main
concern is still majors and
prospective majors, I feel we will
offer many courses that appeal to
those with no inclination to learn
the language.”

Boggs pointed to the current
popularity of German 186 as an
example of how non-majors might
utilize courses in the department.
The course focuses on the work of
Herman Hesse, and boasts an
enrollment of 200 students.

A new fall course is German 791
[evening] which will enable pro-
spective travelers to gain basic
conversational skills, as well as
valuable advice on German culture
and customs.

Boggs has devoted much of his
time to charting the changes he will
see implemented in September.
Now that things are shaping up, his
next goal is computer-aided in-
struction to complement the
present language-lab facilities.

Boggs invites suggestions from
majors and non-majors alike. “The
students have to tell us what they
want or don't want--that's the only
measure of our success."

Lapidary Enihusiasts--

From For and Near

BY TOM VERBISH

_Been to the latest rock show?
lt’s going on at the Student Union
Ballroom right now.

No, it's not a musical group, but a
lapidary show. Lapidary is the art
of cutting and engraving preeioirs
stones.

Semiprecious and precious
stones, both roughcut and finished,
of every size and description, are
being offered for sale. Prices range
from 25 cents to $1000.

“As a hobby. lapidary has
something for everyone," said
James Dorsey .Jr., chairman of the
Pittsburgh Mineral and Lapidary
Society‘, which is sponsoring the
show.

“People from all walks of life can
ﬁnd satisfaction and relaxation in

lapidary. It teaches you to slow
down,” said Dorsey, a social
worker and former graduate

student at Pitt.

“What we are trying to do at this
show is generate interest in our
field. This is the only area in the
East that isn’t into lapidary. Out
West it has been going strong for
years,” stated Dorsey.

The show is running through
February 10, from 10 am-8 pm.
Some of the stones on display and
for sale include amethyst, aqua-
marine, jade, opal, and ruby.

Most of the lapidaries at the
display are hobbiests who receive
rough stones from wholesalers,
dealers and other lapidaries. A
few, like Faye Klug, also dig for
mineralswhen on vacation.

Carl Cooper has occasionally
resorted to smuggling.

“There is an embargo on all
minerals coming out of Mexico,”
Cooper said. “For me personally
to smuggle out any valuable items
from Mexico would have been
costly had I been caught. Instead I
paid a local to smuggle them out
since if caught he’d pay only a

minimal fine.”

The profit motive is not a factor
for most of the lapidaries.

Boyd Hess, of the Hess Gem and
Mineral House. said, “Our hobby
is an expensive one but we don't
make any money. Everything goes
back into the business. However.
we have some stones here you
couldn't get for three times the
price at a jewlry store."

Several lapidaries, including Tom
Jack, mentioned Brazil as the ideal
place to go rockhounding. “The
closest place to go looking for
minerals is Flint Ridge, Ohio,

about 125 miles from here,” said ,

Dorsey’s wife Veola. _

Both Cliff Jesmer. a geologist.
and Ron Jones, the only full-time
lapidary at the show, agreed
interest in lapidary is growing.

“Five years ago there was only
one club in the Pittsburgh area,
now there are about seven,”
Jesmer.

William Savko said he was very
pleased by student response to the
show, while Dorothea Porter, from
Rockville, Maryland said, “Bus-
iness has been pretty good
considering the energy crunch.”

MarvinGarrett, retired for five
years expressed the common
enthusiasm of the lapidaries--“I
just get a kick out of it."

Local 29 Gets Benefits  

BY N. J. BROWN
Members of maintenance work-
ers’ union, Local 29, will receive

most of the economic benefits‘

awarded in their new contract with
Pitt, despite the fact their contract
remains unsigned, William Han-
non, director of employee relations
for the University assured yester-
day.

“The University is paying all the
economic benefits under the
contract except the improved Blue

 

Cross-Blue Shield plan, which by
its terms [under the new contract]
goes into effect one month after the
contract is signed,” Hannon said.

Thus all pay increases awarded
through the contract will be
included in the workers’ pay checks
next Friday. their first money since
the 12 day strike was settled
January 27. Workers must be on
the job a full two weeks before
being eligible for pay.

taxing the Students’ Pocketbooks 

fulﬁll its basic function--in this
case--a committment to students
and their needs. Nor can students
respect an administrative leader-
ship that allows the committment
to be solely a vocal one.

At this point students and the
administration must ask them-
selves some fundamental ques-
tions. Is the University an
institution committed to the chal-
lenges of education? For whom
does the University exist? Do
student needs mean anything on
this campus. or are they something
to be manipulated by the Univer-'
sity when the need arises? Are we
only numbers in Harrisburg?

Mr. Dutton’s answers are clear.
Students are to be used by the
administration to “eliminate waste
and cutback on University spend-
ing.” And Joe Dutton speaks for
the University.

As Dutton speaks about waste.
students see one more area where
their needs finish second. The time
schedule is a necessity for all
students, as are classes and
advisers. The University is

fast as in the case of State laws
regulating the driving of automo-
biles. A person need not pass a
test or apply for a license to smoke
nor can his smoking “license” be
revoked for infractions. To smoke
or not to smoke is the choice~ of
every person. I do not complain
about people who do not smoke
because that is his or her own
private decision.

The case of littering the campus
with butts is a trivial point to bring
up. Why does not Mr. Charles also
complain about the candy wrap-
pers. papers, and other assorted
pollution on campus? These things
are more of an eyesore than
cigarette butts. His complaints
about burn marks, however. is
valid; but you need not condemn
the entire smoking population for
the actions of an inconsiderate few
who do not know how to dispose of
a lit butt without damaging seats
and floors. These few people rank
with those in the catagory of
immature people who will carve
their names or other messages on
the tops of wooden desks for
posterity to read. Many smokers
use empty pop cans for ashtrays
and I even know a few who carry
small covered ashtrays for their
ashes and butts. if maybe the
University provided ashtrays in
classrooms. the butt problem
would be somewhat alleviated
because_ the considerate people
would use them. __

lfthere is an ashtray handy when
lsmoke I will use it rather than use
the floor. But ifthere is none then I
have to dispose of it in other ways
and I will try not to damage the
area. Does Mr. Charles go clear
out of his way or leave his seat in
class to dispose of unwanted paper
in the proper receptacles? He is to
be commended if he does but he
will be a part of a small minority.

I realize that there may be a
certain amount of discomfort to
non-smokers when I smoke. That
is why I blow my smoke toward the
ceiling and out of the breathing
area of non-smokers. Here again
we come to the problem of those
inconsiderate people who do not
care and blow their smoke in the
direction of non-smokers and cause
the discomfort. It Is those people
that Mr. Charles should complain

obligated to provide basic services
to students.

The argument against a fee,
though, exceeds academic neces-
sity. A student has a basic right to
attend classes. A student- has a
basic right to meet with advisors.
A student has a basic right to
receive a time schedule. We
should not be required to pay for a
basic right.

However. the administration is
not totally to blame for this
situation. The past SG admini-
stration failed to resolve this same
issue last fall. It was only
concerned with postponing the
problem until a new Board came
into office.

This does not speak well of the
idea of continuityexpressed by the
former SG president. Apparently.
only crises are to continue.

But. still. it is inconceivable that
such a plan could have been
proposed in the first place.

,, It seems Dutton has a tendency
to use students to “eliminate waste
and cutback on University spend-
ing.” This is the same Joseph

 Letters to the Editor

about and not the entire smoking
population. M

The issue of smoking in class_can
be compromised by smoker and
non-smoker areas as is done in
many movie theatres where
smoking is allowed in the balcony
so as not to effect the non-smokers
sitting below. Since the majority of
classrooms are completely enclosed
and need artificial circulation, a
simple test could be performed to
determine which section of the
room is “downwind" of the other.
It is in this section that the smokers
would sit so as not to bother the
non-smokers. Ashtrays would be
provided to help stop the accumu-
lation to butts and ashes on the
floor. This is only one idea. More"
compromises in this area can be
formulated.

Finally he says that a smoker is no
special person in a public place.
This is true. but his statement
infers that the nonsmoker is
special which is false. What needs
to be done is a compromise
between both parties so both can
do their thing. By trying to stop
smokers from smoking is infringing
on our rights more than you say

'that we are infringing on yours.

Mr. Charles is within his rights to
complain about the inconsiderate
portion of the smoking population.
but he should not indict every
smoker on the actions ofjust a few.

Sincerely,
Bruce Palko

Dutton that proposed the $5
add-drop fee last spring, and, then,
again in September.

Perhaps, it will soon be time for
the travelling road show to make its
third kick-off appearance. The
Vice-Chancellor seems to be doing
his best to tax students’ pocket-
books above and beyond the cost of
tuition.

What next? Maybe it will be 50
cents to attend a class, a dollar to

-meet with an advisor, $2.50 to
register, $3 for an exam, or $5 to

Absurd? On February 19
students will be required to pay 25

‘No one believed me.

No one believed me when I said,
“life is rough.” People said I was
too young to _be the voice of
experience. Indeed.

Take a look around you, if you
haven't doneso already. Now I bet
you wished you hadn’t taken that
look.

A truck driver fatally shot in
Delaware yesterday. Gasoline
stations drying up as people
converge on them in droves. Food
supplies shrinking. although ad-
mittedly not yet to the critical
stage.

You don’t have to be the voice of
experience to say “life is rough”
with any authority. '

Sure. as I write this column the
teletype says that a tentative
agreement in the truck strike may
have been reached. Still, I
wouldn’t recommend jumping up
and shouting for joy.

Not that I want to be an alarmist.
Alarmists are people who blindly
rush out and stock up on toilet
paper merely because they hear a
rumor from. an “authority”--a TV
talk show host.

While it certainly isn’t original to
say so. it is at least accurate to say
we've got a lot of problems ahead.’

And ifthere is one problem that I
would rank above all others, it is
ourselves.

Yes, you understood me cor-
rectly. Ourselves. Us. The dumb
Yanks.

The truck problems of late just
proved how unquestionably brain-
less so many Americans are, better
than I could ever do with
harangues.

In the one block of one street in
my neighborhood the other mor-
ning. five (count ’em) people
started their automobiles and let

them idle away just so the interior
would‘ be nice and toasty warm for
the drive to work.

The practice repulsed me a few
years ago when I learned that even
air-pollution control cars will warm
up faster if they are driven, not
allowed to idle.

But then when the gasoline
shortage began to hit hard, the
people who idled their engines
seemed to me very stupid. In fact,
they seemed downright selfish,
maybe even piggish. Creature
comfort would survive, no matter
how bad the energy crisis became.

That was it, alright.

When the gasoline trucks all but
disappeared from our roads,
intelligent Americans ran their
engines just to stay warm, whether
before driving to’ work or while
waiting in line for gas.

Now I’ll admit that all service
stations, even 'in~Pittsburgh, are
not located at the bottom of hills.
This would make things really
easy--you could cut your engine
and just drift to the pumps.

And I'll also admit that constant-
ly cutting your engine and
restarting it every time the gasoline
line moves is very hard on the

/-battery.

But I would think that the
highly-educated US citizen would
try to sacrifice just once in a while.
That’s not too much to ask.

Alas.

Some fools idled so much that
they ran out of gas waiting for gas.
It really builds my confidence in the
average American.

Andlyou doubt me when I say
that life is rough?

Just trust the American citizen
‘to make the sacrifices necessary to
help solve our problems.

You'll see how rough life is.

Unsigned Contract no

Bar To Benefit Payment

(Continued from Page 3)

“We feel despite the fact that the
union hasn’t signed the contract,
the people are entitled to the
beneﬁts, Hannon said. “They
will get all their retroactivity."

Hannon said he and other
University personnel have received
numerous telephone calls from Pitt
maintenance workers, wondering if
they will get their raises despite
the unsigned contract. “People are
concerned with whether they’re
going to get their pay or not,” he
said. “They’ll [wage increases]
show up in their paychecks next
week.”

The new contract includes ‘ a
30-20-20 cent wage increase over
the next three years for. the
workers, except those in Main-
tenence One, comprised mainly of
maids. The union’s original
demand was 85 cents over three
years, and the University's first
offer was 65 cents. A

According to Hannon, under the
new wages, “They (the workers)
went to the same pay schedule as
workers in the Downtown class A
buildings.” He explained main-
tenance workers Downtown are
paid according to the classification
of the building in which they

-worked--class A buildings being

the more expensive ones to rent in,
such as the US Steel Building,
‘Hannon explained.

University buildings are not
classiﬁed in this manner, Hannon
noted, and this, coupled with the
fact Pitt maintenance workers
sometimes work in several dif-
ferent buildings, accounts for a
more general pay scale.

“We pay them all the top rate,"

T Hannon said.

The new contract also includes an
improved pension plan; a paid
lunch break, -eliminating. two
shorter breaks, for those working a
shift including midnight, parents-
in-law included in bereavement
allowances; and Martin Luther
King day a paid holiday, provided
it is a University holiday.

Skrabut expects the study com-
mission to begin work next week.
Skrabut said the three men have
cleared it with their boss, Super-
intendent Robert Colville, to take
some time off their normal jobs,
permitting them to be on campus to
conduct the study.

(AP) Truck trafﬁc was reported
increasing in some areas Thursday,
but many independent truckers’
leaders said they would continue
their eight-day strike rather than
accept a proposed settlement.

“lt’s a sellout,” said Roger
Galloway of Overdrive Magazine,

one inﬂuential organization which‘

pushed for the shutdown that has
brought guerrilla warfare tactics in
some areas and left more than
100,000 workers laid off. “They
sold these guys down the river.”

The Washington settlement de-
nounced by some strikers provides
for delivery to truck stops of 100
per cent of the diesel fuel needed
by drivers and permission for
truckers to get more money for the
cargo they haul in direct proportion
to increased fuel costs.

It also was said to provide for an
immediate freight rate surcharge to
compensate for recent fuel price
increases and a government study
of possible increases in maximum
weights trucks may carry.

In another strike-related de-
velopment, the House passed 374
to 6 and sent to President Nixon
legislation allowing independent
drivers to begin passing on to
shippers next Friday fuel price
increases they have incurred since
last May 15.

The inevitable result of these
actions, if implemented, will be
higher prices for consumers buying
truck-transported goods. Trucking
officials say diesel fuel has

increased about 15 cents a gallon
since last May.

Meanwhile, a more layoffs and
more violence were reported.

Some stations had already used
their February allotment of gaso-
line.

Associated Press reported in a
weekly survey of Pennsylvania
service stations, only 31% of 216
stations contacted were selling
gasoline without restriction.
Twenty-eight percent were out of
gas entirely, and the situation
appeared to be worsening by the
hour. ‘

Even if the truckers agreement is
carried through, it may take days
before the current situation returns
to‘ normal.

At the March 9. 1973 meeting of.

the Faculty of Arts and Sciences,
the Committee presented the
report of its study.

According to the report, advisors
feel they provide considerable
assistance to the students, through
discussions drawing out and
articulating students’ own
interests. Advisors deny they
direct student choices in any way
more specific than this. Advisors
also feel it is beneficial that they
are at a similar stage in life as the
students (Advising Center em-
ployees are graduate students)
because they have empathy with
the students.

Student questionnaires did not
corroborate the’ advisors'. the
report added.
plained of being rushed through
registration, impersonal advisors,
frequent mistakes, and being
“pushed" into courses they did not
appreciate. The Committee con-
sidered it a promising trend,
however, that upperclass students
complained much more about their
past experiences with the Advising
Center than did those students who
are registering through the Center
now.

Specific recommendations for
both lower and major board
advising were ma‘de\in the
Committee report to FAS. For
lower board it was suggested:
---the Career Planning Division of
the Counseling Service be moved to
the Cathedral, to offices near the
Advising Center
---major bulletin board space be set
aside in the Advising Center
lobby, where departments could
notify students of specific require-
ments and opportunities offered
---more faculty prescence in the
Advising Center; each department
designate a few faculty members
(major advisors) for Advising
Center liaison ‘ _
---further improve liaison by having
each advisor develop a specialized

Students com- _

knowledge -in one or two depart-
ments other than his own.
The specific suggestions

major board advising included:
---make the “major" board a fact:
coordinate the advising systems of
different departments more close-
ly. Both CAS and the Counseling
Service should help train major
advisors.

for

---increase liaison between the
departments and the Advising
Center.

---increase departmental support
for advisors.

---centralize the departmental ad-
vising, system. Increase its
consistency. Then publicize it,
make it visible. Have one location
where all informational materials
are located.

The distinct separation between A

the Advising Center and the
department advisors seemed the
root of many of the problems, such
as poorly informed lower board
advisors, and major advisors
ignorant of College requirements.

Recognizing this, the Committee
made a major recommendation,
noting “There is no one admini-
strative officer who serves as an
overall focus of responsibility for
the entire system. The CAS Dean
could play this role, however. he is
distracted by other activities. We
therefore propose the appointment
of an assistant dean whose sole
responsibility is advising, Lower
Board and Major Board.”

Little has been done by the
Committee since issuing their
report to the FAS. “We’re in the
position of issuing a report, the
amendment has been passed, and
we're waiting for action from the
Dean's office,” Committee Chair-
man Rawson said.

No action has come from the
Dean’s office on appointing some-
one to coordinate major and lower
boards, and though Advising
Center Director Fred .Koloc is
answerable to the Dean’s office, he
continues to run ‘the Advising

Center with what Associate Dean
Tobias Dunkleberger calls “a
certain degree of autonomy.”

Koloc sees problems and solu-
tions in the same areas the
Advising Committee’s report
noted. but doesn't agree with all
the specifics. He noted that,
immediately upon the Committee's
recommendation. major bulletin
board space was established in the
advising Center lobby for specific
departmental requirements, pro-
grams. and notices.

Lack of faculty input in the
Advising Center Koloc also agreed
with. ‘‘I thought this was the most
important and viable criticism (in
the report)," he said. As a result,
the Center held at least a dozen
coffee hours last term. inviting the
chairman. major advisors, and
interested faculty of a department,
one department per meeting. At
these meetings Koloc said, depart-
ment members explain their
department's philosophy and focus
to the Center's advisors. It also
provides the department an oppor-
tunity to note any proposed
changes, review courses and their
content, and to dispel any
misconceptions students may have
about their department, so the

advisors can in turn clarify such
things to their advisees.

Koloc considers this coffee hour
system more beneﬁcial than the
recommendation each advisor
develop a specialized knowledge in
one or two departments other than
his own. He estimated about 25 of
the 35 advisors usually show--
“some of them have classes
scheduled at the time”--and Koloc
feels that by word of mouth the

information actually gets much_

further than the 25.

He also expressed preference for
this method because the advisors
get the information first hand from
the department, rather than from
other advisors. Six more coffee
hours have already been scheduled
this term.

Koloc noted that since the report
came out “we’ve asked the
advisors to be much more aware.”
He said every student who goes on
probation or receives a G grade
gets a letter from the advisor,
requesting the student make an
appointment to review any pro-
blems, or a letter explaining
exactly what the grade means and
that the student has only one term
to complete the course work.

“Ihesitated to give them another
duty right now,” Koloc said,
further clarifying why he chose the
coffee hours over the department
specialization suggestion.

Koloc also recognized a need for
career counseling. A career
information room has been estab-
lished on the Cathedral's ninth
floor with the Advising Center, and
Koloc is hopeful that sometime in
the near future members of the
Counseling Service staff could

spend a couple hours daily in the -

Advising Center during registra-
tion. ’

“We had been working in the
direction of strengthening our ties
with the Counseling Center
(Service) but _the report kind of

urged us along," he admitted.

Koloc said though he feels the
Advising Center has improved and
the quality of advisors risen
steeply, “I am not satisfied in
anyway that the Advising Center is
doing all it can.”

He said in addition to needing
more departmental information,
which he hopes the continuing
coffee hours will help alleviate,
more advice on choosing majors
and careers is necessary. “You
have to kind of help students go
about how to make a decision,"
Koloc noted. \

ICAS Dean Robert Marshall
elaborated on Koloc’s idea of the
necessity to teach students the how
to’s of decision-making, career and
major selection. “The principal
issue in the report is to unite the
major  lower boards,” Marshall
said. ‘-‘But I think there's a larger
issue at stake.”

The most formal way to
distribute advice is through a set of
requirements, he said. “I think the
FAS did a very irresponsible thing
when they took away the require-
ments (of the College) and didn’t
substitute anything for them.”

When students complain of
inadequate advising, Marshall
said. “What they’re saying is that
you took away the requirements
and didn't give us anything in their
place.” The alternative to these
formalized requirements, he feels,
is to “ﬁnd those places in the
curriculum where ‘advice’ can be
given, such as freshman year.”
Marshall suggested freshman
seminars as one means of
dispensing this advice. “Some can

',be taught by academics, but some

can be taught by profession and
people out there, such as David
Marshall of Environmentals Pitts-
burgh, who have done something
with their lives.

“I also find myself focusing on the
80s—-I’d like to see a redefinition of
these courses. For example,

political science 80 could be a
means of introducing people to
what it means to be a political
scientist.

“The faculty should see them-
selves as working as advisors,"
Marshall continued. “The curricu-

lum and the faculty can be a big
influence on the students."

Associate Dean Dunkleberger
concurred with Marshall’s view of
the faculty's position. “In a
broader sense every faculty mem-
ber is a potential advisor."

However Dunkleberger, who
oversees the rules and regulations
of the College and handles all
academic problems, feels too much
is often demanded of advisors and
that the constant complaints can be
expected “as part of the human
condition.”

“It is expecting pretty much to
expect the advisor to tell the
students every single thing the
students need to know.” He added
that concerning job opportunities,
it was unrealistic to expect major

   

advisors to counsel on things they
aren't familiar with. He noted
most major advisors are concerned
only with grad school and this is the
only area in which they can really
give guidance.

“I cannot fault the English
advisors, for example, if they
cannot give explicit advice on how
to get a job. And this, I think, is
the root of most of the‘ (student)

. complaints,” Dunkleberger said.
“People have an unrealistic notion
of what they should expect from
advising.”

The flow of information from the
Advising Center to the department
majors advisors is impeded,
Dunkleberger feels, “because most
major advisors don't realize they
need advice," concerning college
requirements, and other depart-
ments.

He feels the Advising Center
employees‘ knowledge of depart-
ments is much better than the
departments’ knowledge of the
College. “This department in-
formation is supposed to‘ be
incorporated in these publica-
tions,” he said. Noting there's
always a lag of information
concerning courses. he suggested
any course not described in the

‘ course description booklet not be

permitted to be offered.

“This is likely to add to the
add/ drop problem," Dunkleberger
said. “Students must compensate
for this late information by
dropping another course to register
for one not described in the
booklet, and sometimes they must
even revise their whole schedule to
accomo_date this course, thus

. demanding more add/drops.”

Dunkleberger’s concern with
technicalities of the system was

the registrar presented the-«new;

posed charging $5 per add/drop

The fee was supposed to reduce the

It was soon‘felt, Kaufman said,
that a booklet comprising all the’

evaluations--was necessary. , "A

Kaufman noted. ' » ' A

However, the Board made no
suggestions along the lines of the
Committee's report. “The.
mechanical part can be solved I
sooner than the thinking part’ of
it," Kaufman insisted. ' "1

The problems continue’ to exist
and solutions continue to _'be

BY JIM MALONEY

Ed. Note: This is the second
article in the four part series on the
evolution of Rock ’n Roll. Today,
the country to city blues transition.

When many blacks headed North
in the late forties, they were
quickly incorporated into the fast
pace of urban life. One of their first
adaptations was of their music.
This country-to-city transition was

. to_have a profound effect on the
a development of the popular music

of the next fifteen years.
The 1947-50 period saw 5 the
earliest post-war bluesmen begin
to assimilate styles from their
country origins. B.B. King, today
the most universally recognized
/“blues singer,” drew his sound
from several major inﬂuences. His
trademark since the ﬁfties, bend-
ing and sustaining guitar notes, he
claims was inspired by tenor sax
man Lester Young. Further jazz
influences include the late Charlie
Christian--once Benny Goodman's
guitarist--and the mellow gypsy
BB’s

string riffing of Aaron “T-Bone”
Walker.

Walker was apparently the first
blues guitarist to use an "electric
instrument, and his style is
plugged into the work of everyone
from Chuck Berry to Eric Clapton.

Heading North in the late 40's
were McKinley Morganfield
(Muddy Waters), John Lee Hooker,
and Sam “Lightnin” Hopkins.
Hooker settled in Detroit, where he
dominated an urban blues scene
Hopkins

traveled and recorded blues artists,
later returning to Texas. Waters
proceeded to establish Chicago as
the home base of something other
than meathouses and freight
trains.

At this time, two distinct blues
patterns began to emerge. The
older country-bred artists in urban
centers and the “city blues” sound
that became R&B. Many R&B
performers adopted a “Big band”

. style of playing [Joe Turner, Ray
Charles, even B.B. King], while
some went for a tight “jump”
sound [Roy BRown, Johnny Otis,
Ivory Joe Hunter]. These artists
evolved as a result of the
blues-bases dance bands of the
1940’s.

1951-55 marked the second
generation of country-to-city
bluesmen. Some, like Chester
Burnett (Howlin’ Wolf) had gone to
Memphis from Mississippi in the
40’s, and only now headed for
Chicago. Elmore James was
touring as far west as Los Angeles,

 

 II: Rocl<in' in Chicago

and would soon arrive in Chicago
as well. -

Chicago is responsible for the
greatest quantity and most consis-
tent quality of postwar artists and
recordings. The urban blues
flourished on Chicago’s South and
West Sides. The sound was
charged with the ferocity and
relentless power of big city life.
The country styles were being
updated and translated from a solo
framework [man and guitar] to an
ensemble approach [electric guitar,
amplified harmonica, steady rhy-
thm section].

The band that began this
approach is still regarded as the
finest blues band put together--
anywhere. anytime. The man who
began that band was Muddy
Waters. He dominated the

Elmore James

Chicago scene from the start, and
today his name is the trade name
for the driving sound of urban
blues. In its prime (1948-1954), his
Chicago band featured Jimmy
Rogers on guitar, Little Walter on
harp, Big Crawford on bass, Otis
Spann on piano and Elgin Evans on
drums. They recorded some of the

most innovative. most dynamic
blues of any era.
Throughout the decade, the

various Water’s bands fashioned‘
the idiom known as Chicago blues.

It still sounds as alive and moving
today as it must have when it
sizzled across the crowded dance

floors of Southside clubs in the
early ﬁfties.

Elmore James was one of the
most inﬂuential stylists of the
Chicago era, successfully cross-
breeding the country bottleneck
blues of Robert Johnson with his
own powerful approach. His
slashing slide guitar was a
correspondence course-by-record
for Duane Allman, Al Wilson, Mike
Bloomfield and countless guitarists
of the sixties. James kept the fiery
Delta style alive in his recordings,
and his nerve-wrenching blues
rank with the best of the post-war
period.

Howlin’ Wolf is a living legend
among the Chicago blues giants.
Although he never achieved the
popularity Waters eventually
found, his contribution to Rock is
immense. He's a rugged blues
shouter. half-wolf, half-man. At
sixty-four, he can still mount a
stage. prowling, howling, stomping
his way through his wild brand of
blues.

A “Who's Who" in the Windy
City would be incomplete without
mention of the two prototypical
harmonica men of the period. One
was Sonny Boy Williamson II (Rice
Miller). He is often confused with
Sonny Boy Williamson I (John Lee
Williamson) who recorded for RCA
Victor in the forties. Sonny Boy I
composed “Good Morning Little

Sonny Boy Il’s composing credits
include “Help Me," (Ten Years

(Allman Brothers). He worked the
St. Louis-Chicago blues scene and
played in a powerful style that
influenced John Mayall, Paul
Butterﬁeld, and every white kid
who ever toyed with a two-dollar
harmonica. ‘

The other major harp man was
Marion Walter Jacobs (Little
Walter), the first to amplify the
harmonica. His work with the
original Muddy Waters band was
followed by success with his own
group, The Jukes. He was a true
innovator in the sense that he
played in a way no one had ever

1 before attempted or since equalled.

He was the mentor of every harp

player to follow him, and as such. ~

his contribution to the music is
overwhelming. ‘
To understand the evolution of
modern rock music, it is necessary
to recognize the effect that these
five men have had on what we hear
today. Together, they charted the
course for amplified music in the

“Serpico": Another Cop Slory, Except It's True

BY M .C. PILECKI

Not exactly an epic tale division.
but yet another saga of bravery,
fortitude, and that sort of thing. is
Serpico. The title character is a
“counter culture" type New York
City policeman, idealistic, honest
and bucking a system that
supports, or at least condones.
graft and corruption in the ranks.

Now, at first glance the idea of a
long-haired. bearded cop who
wears a gold ring in one ear. digs
opera and ballet. gets stoned. and
wages a long battle against crooked
cops. apathetic administrators and
blind bureaucracy--well. it all
sounds a bit preposterous, like
some more liberal-inspired. anti-
cop propaganda. Except for one

slight detail. It's all true.

Okay, dramatically rounded out a
bit and somewhat subjective, but
the main facts presented in the
movie are essentially true, as the
Knapp Commission hearings have
documented. Frank Serpico is a
'Brooklyn-bom guy who, since
boyhood, has had ony one
ambition: to be a cop, which means
helping people, being respected,
and serving the public. But finally
joining the force opened up his
idealistic eyes, and he found a
closed society that thought of the
public as “them” against “us.”
He found yards of red tape and
regulations hindering his work, and
fellow cops advising him to forget
about the whole thing. And finally,

he found that nearly every cop he
worked with was on the take, and
he was powerless to do anything
about it, and his superiors were
unconcerned despite repeated re-
ports.

Watching this highly unorthodox
cop use his highly unorthodox
methods (including disguises, roof-
tops jaunts, a facility in several
languages and acting ability) to do
his job ranks the ﬂick with the best
of the detective-type entertain-
ments. But watching him find that
the biggest robbers share the
locker room and sit behind badges
thrusts Serpico into a gripping
drama offrustration. suspense and
a screen paranoia unmatched by
few of this genre.

As played by Al Pacino, probably
one of the best actors to have
cropped up recently, Frank Serpico
is a bit glamorized but yet totally
believable and human. even
though the script at times seems to
make him a saint. Pacino manages
to paint a picture of dedication
frustrated by reality, but yet
retaining some of the unorthodoxy
that had Serpico branded a
‘‘psycho’' by his colleagues and
discomﬁted superiors.

If there are any faults with the
film, it's in its reluctance to point
its ﬁnger at the powers-that-be that
allowed the problem to go
unchecked for so long. A reticence
not shared by Peter Maas’ book,
which blithely named names all the

way to John Lindsay. Serpico’s
main complaint with the effete
investigations of his allegations
was that a “few flunky cops"
would get busted. leaving the big
bosses unchecked or--at the most--
slapped on the wrists. Serpico is
guilty of the same.

Persad and Sexual Dynamics

BY MONICA A. CIROCCO

Members of sexual minority
groups (male and female homo-
sexuals. transvestites, transexuals.
and other minorities) in the
tri-state area now have a place to
go if they seek counseling. says
Randal Forrester. executive direc-
tor of Persad Center. Inc.

Persad is an independent,
non-profit, comprehensive mental
health center for sexual minorities
which has its own board of
directors. It was founded
December 1, 1972 by Forrester and
James Huggins, consultation and
education supervisor, after 19
months of background work.

Why “Persad”? “We wanted
an innocuous. non-labeling name
for the Center because it is meant
to serve a wide range of sexual
minorities--not_just homosexuals.
It serves to help those in search of
sexual identity. A “gay" label
would be misleading. So the name
was derived from personal ad-
justment,” Forrester said.

The Center's staff, consisting of

KDKA with the feature reports on
prostitution and homosexuality
being shown this week on the 7 and

Forrester noted, “Persad acts as

Atlour sessions the problems are

expects is equal to what he gets.
He is given full information--good
and bad. The sessions are

Healthy for Syracuse?

The injuries keep increasing, but
so does Pitt’s winning streak. With
Mickey Martin watching from the
sidelines, the Panthers rumbled to
a sloppy 83-70 victory over Kent
State at the Field House Wednes-
day.

Billy Knight, his shoulder
heavily taped, recovered from a
slow start to lead all scorers with 26
points. Center Jim Bolla and guard
Ken Wagoner both picked up
minor injuries in the game.

With the 14-4 Syracuse Orangemen

the outcome of the game. It will
take a better performance than
Wednesday's for Pitt to down
Syracuse.

The Kent State game was
marred by 52 turnovers, 31 being
committed by the Golden Flashes.
Pitt was put to a tough test by an
8-ll team.

After trading four buckets
apiece, Kent State opened up a
nine point lead, a margin Pitt had
not been behind by all season. The
Flashes had been ‘successful at
splitting Pitt’s defense down
the middle, and after the Cats
tightened the center area up, they
began to close the gap.

As he has done so successfully

BY RON SIEGEL
SPORTS EDITOR

 

The Pitt basketball team has come a long way this year, much further
than anybody expected. With a healthy team, the Cats would not be an
underdog to any team remaining on the schedule, with the possible
exception of South Carolina, due to the home court advantage.

The problem is, Pitt does not have a healthy team. Mickey Martin is
in bad shape, and Billy Knight is playing with one arm. The injuries
that Ken Wagoner and Jim Bolla suffered in the Kent State game are
not serious, and those two are expected to be playing at 100%
tomorrow night against Syracuse.

Knight played against William & Mary and against Kent ‘State with
his left shoulder heavily taped. He was hampered byit considerably.
Martin sat out most of the W&M game and did not even dress against
KSU.

‘‘I’m playing Saturday,” Martin ﬁatly stated in the training room
after Wednesday’s game. “That’s what I say.”

What Martin means by that last statement is that the doctors may
tell him something else. His injury is serious. It has been diagnosed as

_an internal nerve bruise. He receives heat treatment three times a day
for it. Heat and rest are the only cures.

Martin may be out for the rest of the season. He may play against
Syracuse. Mickey Martin is no ordinary athlete. If you tied one arm‘
behind his back and made him wear lead boots, he'd be begging the
coach to let him play, and he'd be effective-.

He is hustle, courage, and teammanshlp all personiﬁed. He may not
be able to take sitting on the bench for the Syracuse game.

“i was just dying to put the uniform on Wednesday,” he recalled.
‘‘I felt so helpless sitting on the bench.”

Although he played the entire Kent State game, Knight was
nowhere near his normal self. He started the game playing with one
arm. He couldn't dribble or rebound with his left hand. and his
shooting was way off. ‘ V

"My game was terrible," he said after the game Wednesday while
getting his shoulder treated. ‘‘It was okay until I got hit on the
shoulder. After that, I couldn't get my left hand up to where my right
was."

When Knight was healthy, it was often said that he was better
one-handed than most players are with two. He did prove that
Wednesday, hitting for 26 points and snaring 12 rebounds, but it will
take more than a one-handed Knight to beat Syracuse if Martin doesn’t
play. .

Knight has to learn to play with the pain in his shoulder. It's going
to get bumped in every game, and “Mooney" is just going to have to
adapt to it, just as be adapted to a calf injury last season. ‘

Ridl was criticized by some fans for playing Knight the entire Kent

.State game. He had to play Knight. regardless of the score. When
that game began, Knight rebounded one-handed, dgibbled
right-handed only, and shot poorly. After playing for a while, he began
to shoot better. and started rebounding and dribbling the way he used
to.

Knight knows how much the team needs him. Even if he has to play

therestoltheseasouwltl|atIped‘alIdI|der,lIebgolngtoadapttoit
withirhafewgamessothathiascorlnganddefensiveplaywillreturnto
norm .

The only question is whether or not he can make enough progress by
Saturday.

Martin's status is uncertain. He insists he is going to ..play. but
others who will make the decision are only hoping. ‘
bk'll‘he game is not a must for Pitt, but a victory could wrap up an NCAA

The Panther bench has come through in the past when Martin or
Knight weren't playing. Let's hope they can come through with
neither at 100%. -

all season, Pitt head coach Buzz
Ridl went to his bench for fresh
troops. With Lew Hill, Willie Kelly
and Wagoner into the lineup, the
Cats raced into the lead with 6: 14 to
go in the first half, 29-37.

After the score was tied at 31-31,
Pitt rolled off six straight points on
buckets by "Wagoner, Hill, and
Tommy Richards.

Richards finished the game with
20 points, his personal season high,
and second highest in his two-year
college career. Richards also
picked up seven of Pitt’s 15 assists,
and leads the team with 69 on the
season.

Kent State pulled to within
three, 39-36, before Knight sunk a
jumper to close out the halftime
scoring.

The second half opened with a lot
of sloppy play, and it was hard to
notice that Pitt began to open up a
substantial lead.

Pitt held Kent State to four
points in a five minute span, but
only scored ten themselves. The
lead continued to increase slowly
and sloppily, as Kent State
committed repeated turnovers.

Ridl never got to empty his
bench though, and he repeatedly
shuffled Kelly and Hill in and out of
the game, depending on whether
Pitt was on offense or defense.

Ridl had been expecting Kent
State to come out in a deliberate
styled offense, but the Flashes
played all-out the entire game.

“This is the only style we can

play,” said KSU head coach Frank.

SHOULDER HARNESS and all, Billy Knight hit for 26 points to lead
the Panthers to an 83-70 victory over Kent State Wednesday. The Cats

host Syracuse tomorrow night, and that game is sold out.

.Truitt, who has announced his

retirement effective the end of the

play deliberate. We just have to go

BY RICK STOUFFER
Neither rain nor snow nor lack of
gas keeps the track team from their
appointed meets. It might be a
cliche but the Pitt track team sets

' out today for the far away state of

Michigan for the Michigan State
Relays.

Michigan State has been blessed
with one of the finest tracks in the
country according to Coach Jim
Banner. “It's a ﬂat Tartan surface
and a very excellent track to run
on."

Most teams competing at Lansing
will be from the Midwest including
all the Big 10 schools plus a lot of
smaller schools from northern
Illinois. northern Indiana, and
northern ‘Ohio. The competition
will be keen according to Banner.

“Wisconsin will be a definite
power at the meet,” Banner said,
“They have an excellent group of
distance men [one of Pitt’s strong
points]. Drake University also is
supposed to be a big competitor.”

“Kansas University was supposed
to come," Banner continued. “but
because of the fuel shortage they
had to cancel."

The list of injuries is getting ready
for the meet is (luckily) small.
“Andrew (Harris) is the only
regular not competing.” Banner

said. Harris had reinjured a
hamstring injury of last year‘ in the
Pitt Invitational two weeks ago.

“It's too early .for Andre to be
competing on his leg. He's
working out okay but it's still too
soon," Banner said. “A lot of the
squad hasimheavy colds but other
than that we're in pretty good
shape3'

Packing up for Michigan. Banner
stocked the bus with talent. In the
high hurdles ﬁve men may get a
shot at a record including Jay
Sharpley, J .C. Floyd, Dan Shirrey,
Bill Kathchlar, and Ted Rohan.

The high jump will include Terry
Thompson, George Jupin, and the
Field House and Pitt Varsity record
holder. Tim Riley.

The 60 yard dash will feature
Curtiss Smith and the shotput with
the Big “E" Ernie Webster.

The only entry in the 600 yard run
will be Rick Weaver, also a
possibility in the mile relay. The
two-mile will feature Bob O’Neil.’

The distance medley relay will see
action for the first time in a meet
with Jack Patrick, Wayne Cooley,
Dan Betterley, Rick Markley and
Nick Martin out to prove practice
isn't rough for nothing.

The two-mile relay, which took
first place at Pitt’s Invitational and

were leading at Cleveland last

week until an unfortunate accident ,

took place, will be out to better
their 7.51 second place showing at
the Invite. Tom Moore, Bob
Steele, Rich Jackson, and Chuck
Mozingo are the runners in the
event. x

around several ﬁne wrestlers who
will determine their chances of
gaining a victory against the
Panthers. Freshman Tim
McCamley (7-3) will go up against
Pitt's Rande Stottlemyer (10-4) in
the 126-pound contest. Stottlemyer
is also a freshman. coming off of a
second period pin in the Franklin &

undoubtedly give Stottlemyer a
rough time in this key matchup.
In the very next match. Pitt’s Bob
"Bailey [6-8] will draw Gary Walk

Walk has defeated some tough
opponents thus far and is one of the
most consistent wrestlers on the
team. Bailey is improving with
every match and should give Walk

‘ all he can handle.

The 158 and 167-pound matches
should also provide a bit of
excitement for the Pitt fans. Lock
Haven’s Don Eichenlaub (6-.4-2)
will face Ray Dallatore in the ﬁrst
of these matches. Dallatore
currently holds a 6-8 record but has
been very sharp on occasion.

Schinkel was named coach of the
Penguins on January 13. 1973 and
was on the ﬁrst year of a two-year
contract with the Pens. Button
added that Schinkel has been asked
to stay with the organization in
another capacity, but Schinkel’s
plans were undecided at this time.

Schinkel’s team complied a

that shoul

Whether you’ re still in medical school with the
rigors of three to ﬁve years of graduate medical edu-
cation still to be faced. or are already a practicing
physician, it's our opinion that the Air Force can
offer both professional and personal satisfaction
hard to duplicate in civilian life.

An overstatement? Not if you consider the
speciﬁcs.

Take the problem of graduate medical educa-
tion. It’s a period ofyour life the Air Force can make
considerably easier with comfortable salary and liv-
ing conditions.

Creature comforts aside, the Air Force offers
professional advantages. Besides receiving training
in your own specialty, you'd be in contact with
physicians in all of the medical specialties. You'll
function in an environment which is intellectually
stimulating and professionally challenging.

Not all physicians pursue post residency fellow-

ships. But if you are interested, the Air Force con--...

ducts them both in-house and atcivilian institutions.

The physician already in practice can look for-
ward‘ to other things. If you want training in the
practice of the medicine of the future. you'll ﬁnd it
in the Air Force. For example, there's emphasis on
group medicine and preventive medicine, and the
growing specialty of “family physician." Whatever
your interest, there are few specialties which are not
being practiced in today's Air Force.

The physician starting his practice in civilian
life has to take into account the cost ofsetting up an
oﬂice. The physician commencing his practice in

go with it.

the Air Force does not. He ﬁnds his otﬁce established
for him. Supplies and equipment readily available.
He has many options available to him when treating
patients. For example. he can consult with Air Force
specialists. He also has referral to other Air Force
facilities via aeromedical evacuation. Last, but not
least,' are the satisfactions that come with having
the opportunity for regular follow-ups. and a missed
appointment rate that is practically nil.

Whether you are already a physician. or soon to
become one, you might ﬁnd it extremely interesting
to ﬁnd out what the Air Force has to offer. We think
it could be a real eye-opener. lfyou' ll mail in the cou-
pon, we'd be happy to send you detailed information.

  For Don Stevenson

Gymnastics Is A ‘Perfect’ Life Style

BY VINCE DI NARDO

Perfection. Existential freedom.
Lot s ofchallanges. That's all Don
Stevenson wants from the art of
gymnastics. So. it's understand-
able that he's been moping around
like a kid who lost his favorite toy
for the last week or so.

Opting for gymnastics instead of
the more prestigeous sports be
tackled as a high school athlete,
because he deemed it more
realistic in attaining his somewhat
zany pleasures. Stevenson is
having a hard time of it. It's
difficult to excel without continual
practice and its hard to practice
when you're hurt. Don is hurt.

He pulled a neck muscle in
practice last week and has been in a
state of depression since.

“You can’t believe how frustrat-
ing it is not to be able to practice,”
he said the other day, while idly
doing flexibilty exercises. “I came
to the gym yesterday and I got so
depressed I had to go to the locker
room to get away.

"For me. gymnastics is a life
style. I love it. Some people are
music freaks. gymnastics is my
addiction. I like to think I can stop
anytime I want. but that's what
cigarette smokers say about smok-
ing."

Don sounds like a coach's dream.
Imagine. being frustrated over the
lack of practice. An athlete with a
good gymnastics background.
Stevenson was lured to Pitt by first
year coach lg Perez. His obsession
with practice stems from two
things: first he needs it. and
secondly he thinks highly of the
need to be perfect.

BY YAIER LEHRER

Coming off a big meet against
Maryland in which the Cats pulled
an “unofficial upset." the mermen
will be able to glide through a meet
against West Virginia tomorrow. 2
pm at Trees Pool.

“We shouldn't have much
trouble with their team." said
Coach Dick Bradshaw, “and we'll
mostly be swimming for times
against the Mountaineers before
we have to swim Kent State and
Syracuse." _

The Mountaineers‘ are '3-3
coming into the meet after
dropping their last two meets to
Navy and Maryland. They were
really embarassed by the Navy at
Annapolis by a score of 92-21 while
the Terapins took them with a mark
of 68-44 at Morgantown.

Leading the West Virginians and
will be three swimmers: Bob Pope,
Bob Hamilton, and Norm Purkey
will try to lead the Mountaineers to
an upset but don’t really stand that
much of a chance because once Pitt
gets past those three, there is not
much left for real competition.

“They (WVU) used to have
a breaststroker who used to be able
to beat John Templin." said
Bradshaw. “but Templin has
improved and the other swimmer
has not."

Bob Pope will swim-in the 100‘, ,

and 200-yard free-style. . while

“I like to think I’m a perfectionist
in and out of the gymnasium,” he
said. “It's amazing what you can
do with your body. It gives me a
great feeling of accomplishemtn
and I want to do it the best it can be
doneﬂ’

Of‘ course. Stevenson. from just
outside Philadelphia. is not perfect.
Physically he is close. He's sleek.
but not without substance; well
proportioned and the like. But he's
disappointed with his 3.13 QPA
(students on probation. eat your
hearts out). A high school
valedictorian ought to do better. he
said. And. perfection has evaded
him in competition too.

He has been averaging around 40
points as one of Perez's three
freshman‘ All-Around men. which
is at best average. And just as he
seemed to be getting things
together. the injury thwarted his
plans. However. perfection is not
an overnight proposition and he
realizes it.

But, why would a kid bent on
perfection come to a Pitt team

“What we really want to do is
get the pool record back for the
free-style relay." said Bradshaw.
“The Maryland team broke our
record so we're going to stack the
event with Wallace. Santiago,
Schepner. and Young. We've
broken a record in every meet so
far. so why break that streak?"

This is all in preparation for the
Syracuse and Kent State meets. the
only tough ones left on the Panther
schedule. Kent State is not as good
as Maryland. but the way they
stack up against Pitt is a lot
different from Maryland and this
could provide a lot of trouble for the
Cats.

entertainment since the West

aggression towards the opposition.
Army would try to steal the Navy
goat. Navy would try to steal the
Army mule. Even when the mascot
is a student in disguise. the abuse
is plentiful. Pitt's Marshall Ritchey
is no exception.
—r Very few people that attend Pitt
-I -'5 athletic events know what Marshall
Ritchey looks like. He's the guy
that prances all over the place,
stealing enemy cheerleaders while
dressed as a. Panther. .
One of the few rewards Ritchey
gets is the right to make trips with
the Pitt football team. As you are
about to see, traveling as the Pitt
Panther is not all fun and games.

True to the tradition of the
Panther, Ritchey hung in there for
the entire game. As the ﬁnal gun
sounded though Marshall was in
trouble. He nearly passed out from
heat exhaustion. On the long walk
back to the hotel, a friendly
Southerner offered him some
doctored good. Instead of helping,

afraid of the mask Ritchey was
wearing. The “Black Knight" on
top of the mule tried to put a hole in
the costume. and the guy inside,
with his lance. When it became
apparent to the Cadet that he was
being outmanuevered while atop
his mount. he decided toattack on
foot.

As he jumped off the horse. the
cadet challenged Ritchey to a fight.

“If I» wanted to fight. I'd have
joined the Army," Ritchey cracked.
The cadet had to be restrained after
hearing that. and Marshall made it
to safety with the aid of the Pitt
bandleader's baton.

occupant was the result of a rainy.
cold day at State College when Pitt
lost to Penn State. After the game.
a drunk PSU fan tried to ram her

umbrella down the opening in the"

Panther’s head. She almost made
Marshall the first one—eyed Panther
in history.

That . was just last year.
MarshaII’s most brutal experiences
came in the Notre Dame game two
years ago at South Bend. The
Notre Dame student section de-
cided to pass the Panther up and
down the aisles. They did more
than passing.

They dropped, kicked and
punched Ritchey repeatedly.
“Over the wall” became the cry of
the Irish. He was rescued by the
police, but not before suffering
many bruises and cuts. On the
return flight. the doctors and
trainers paid more attention to the
Panther than any of the players. “I
know how a lynchee feels,” he
recalled. I '

Marshall Ritchey went through a
lot as a symbol of the University.
He also had a lot of fun, kidnapping
a ‘record 12 opponents’ cheer-
leaders.

“It's really nice to go on all the
trips,” he said. “I'd really like
something to show for it though.
Nobody knows who you are."'

Ritchey’s treatment at Pitt is far
below the treatment opposing
mascots get. Evry mascot he has
talked to gets a letter jacket,
blanket and sweater. Some get
scholarships, and most have
classes to practice their stunts

All Marshall gets is one credit of

terms. Since he is a Phys. Ed.

major. this doesn't help him at all.

Things Aren’t Pink For The Panther

Being the Panther involves a lot
of grief and is very time-
consuming. especially in the winter
when Ritchey tries to show up at all
the events occuring.

view of the fact that he's received
as many bruises as most football‘
players. he certainly deserves one’.
