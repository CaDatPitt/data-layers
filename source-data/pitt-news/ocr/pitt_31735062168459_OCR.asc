UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH

New Political Union
Receives Endorsement

From Fculty

4 Students

_ \\

   

HEADS OF campus political organizations listen to discussion of
Political Union proposals.

.By MARY LYNN BROWN

Prospective members of a
new University Political Un-
ion met in Schenley Hall on
Wednesday to discuss the
purpose, structure find func-
tioning of their group —— a
coordinated meeting ground
proposed by Omicron Delta
Kappa (national leadership

honorary) for exchange of ideas
between campus political Organi-
zations.

The Political Union proposed
has received strong endorsement
from a signiﬁcant body of fac-

Aptl1eker’s
Discourse

Cancelled

When Herbert Aptheker, head
theoretician of the Communist
Party of the U.S., spoke at the
University May 4 he Was 1101'-
exactly given a 21 gun salute,
but the capacity audience did lis-
ten to what he had to say.

This, however, was not the
case at St. Vincent College where
Aptheker was scheduled to speak
earlier this Week. His opening
speech was cancelled by a bomb
scare and 1,000 demonstrators
protesting his appearance.

His speech was scheduled to be
part of a seminar which was
called, “A Week's Study on Com-
munism” but only a one day
round table discussion of Marx-
ism and Socialism were retained
in the program after the bomb
scare.

Monday at 5 p.m. state police
at Greensburg said_ they were
notiﬁed that a bomb was placed
in Kennedy Hall, site of the con-
ference. Eight troopers spent over
three hours inspecting the build-
ing, but no bomb was found.

A sign carried by the Commit- '

tee for-National Survival said,

,“Reds, Are Killing Our Boys in '

  
  

Vietnam , While Their -Spokesrne

ulty, administration, and student
leaders. According to coordinator
Bill Cabin, purposes of this Union
would be to ﬁll a “gap in critical
discussion of contemporary so-
cial issues,” and to bring in
bring in speakers and stimulate
discussion which wouldbe impos-
sible to any one member group.

Represented at the meeting
were: the Society for Conserva-
tive Studies, the Liberal Forum,
Students for Peace, NAACP——-Uni-
versity chapter, Liberal Union,
International Relations Club,
Young Democratsand Young Re-
publicans.

The group would not be sole-
ly concerned with political issues,
but with the modern divergence
of political and social issues, and
the programs would be designed
for the beneﬁt of all groups. Pro-
grams would be open to the en-
tire University community. When
possible and desirable, the P01-
itical Union could also serve as
coordinator for joint functions by
two or more member groups.

Formerly, lack of money, lack
of communication between groups
and differences in ideology have
prevented joint programming in
order to present their views to

-the University community and to

each, other, said Cabin.

When asked about the recent
communication between many
campus groups, both political and

social, in relation to the fovrmag .
tion of a Political Union, Cabin

replied that

is “deﬁnitely a
trend.” '

S Parents’ Weekend Hosts
Chancellor’sRecept

Is the campus Godless?

This topic will be discus-
sed at a forum held tomor-
row from 10 a.m. to noon in
Student Union Ballroom as
part of the Parents’ Week-
end program.

According to Judy Young,
co-chairman of the Parents’
Weekend Forum, “this sub-
ject is chosen in the tradi-

tion of the week end because
it is both controversial and in-
teresting to the parents and to

the University community.
other chairman, Jim Janis, re-
marked, “this intellectual experi-
ence is something for the stu-
dents to share with their par-
ents. All students and parents
are invited.

Six people with “diverse inter-
ests, backgrounds, perspectives,
and positions in the University
have been invited to give ﬁve to
seven minute talks to start the
discussion. Those who will speak
include: Rev. Edward C: Biegert,
campus minister; Dr. Edward
Grejuoy, professor of physics;
Herbert McGibbeny, dean of men;

Measure on SU Tabled;
SG Approves Its Budget

(See E'ditom'al--Page Fowr)

. By DAN BOOKER

Student Government (SG) Wednesday tabled a measure that
stated purpose was to “seek a united effort for establishment of
plans -for a new student union.” It also ‘considered and approved a
$25,230 budget for operation of SG activities.

' The student union bill was tabled because “it had no body to
it.” Senator Abe Singer, who introduced the motion to table the bill,
said that a bill to accomplish this stated purpose “has to have a struc
ture, a way to go about it.” All the bill provided for was a armounce-i
ment, in resolution form, of SG feelings to the chancellor. A

The budget, presented by Mitch Pearlman, SG director of ﬁnance,
had as its largest single expense the Homecoming fund of $12,900.
Mostof this money comes from the Student Activities Fee and is
earmarked for entertainment during Homecoming. Nine hundred
dollars of the total will be used to provide 300 additional date tickets

for the Homecoming game.

When considering the “no body” student union bill, Senator Lois
Kane suggested an amendment to make the measure less vague. Her
amendment, which the Senate approved, provided for a committee
to work with the Student Union Board (SUB) and John Loch, direc-
tor of the SU, on the problems of the SU. But, Senator Cathy Baierl
apparently stated the view of a Senate majority when she said, .“The

whole bill should be revised.”

Art Cohen, sponsor of the bill, said later that he felt the bill’s_
purpose was only to make known SG’s intent on the matter. He
pointed out that the SUB was circulating a petition and that alterna-
tives to solve the problems ofpthe SU were being developed by Loch.
For these reasons, he felt that a deﬁnite plan for action needn’t have

been included.

A special committee will Work

of the bill.

' In other action, Terry Hyman, chairman of the Constitution Com-
mittee, again emphasized the need for support from the Senate and
the student body. He explained that the new constitution would-“a,1.
low SG the exercise of control over student affairs justly.. The Sen-
ate decided to work on a plan that will make members of SG avail-
able for questioning about the proposed constitution.
Mike Bryson, currently editor of the Student‘ Directory, was
named to the cabinet position of Director of Publicity. ,
A discussion on extension of the activities fee to graduate stu-
dents had been requested by President Ralph Marming but was by-
passed when the Senate voted down a suspension of the rules to per-

mit the discussion.

the speciﬁc methods of program-
ming and computer communica-
tions used in transforming raw
data and shared programs into a
form that can be used and under-
stood by the computers. The re-
sult of this research is PIL, Pitts-
burgh Interpretative Language,
developed primarily by George
Badger.

The importance of PIL was
underlined by Dr. Orrin Taubee,

director of the University’s Com- 4

puting Center, “Languages are
getting more ‘complex, but com-
munication with the computer is
becoming simpler as languages
such as PIL are being developed.-”

The Computing Center will have

a console at the new Hillman Li-p

brary when it is completed. It
will be used to store references
and citations that might other-
wise be stored in bulky card
ﬁles. Using this system, the stu-
dent will tell a programmer what
kind of information he wants,
perhaps on the crystalline prop-
erties of quartz, and the pro-
grammer will translate the re-
quest into symbols that the com-
puter can understand.

The computer will then search
its ﬁle and report back a list of
references. Among the sources
that are to be programmed into
the system are back issues of
Chemical Abstracts, a NASA ﬁle,
and translations of foreign tech-
nical journals.

Fortunately the Student Government (SG) Senators this year have
;, decided against dawdling in the muck of intagibles and have chosen a
 concrete, dynamic issue-—a new Student Union for the University of Pitts-
 burgh. ‘ ' '

Although the actual means of initiating this project has not been
settled, it was clear at Wednesday night’s meeting, that the Senators are
‘: standing behind this issue. '

The problem they now face is finding. out the most effective way to
 attack this ‘problem.’ The suggestion for a committee to investigate means
1-’ of constructing the Union is a logical first step. In this manner the various
‘_ groups involved in the use of the Union would be able to gather .together
1' and discuss the various possibilities.

There are many ways that we can deal with this issue. Ideally stu-
I dents would go out and solicite funds from alumni and members of the
community. Since the General State Authority will not give funds for the
construction of a building such as the Student Union, the solicitation of
funds seems to be the only other way. At the same time the possibility of
 students ever being able to collect the immense funds needed for such a

heads on these monsters;
the question that remains is
what manner of beast will
they be. Of prime concern is
how often the voracious
things will have to be fed.
Parking monsters come in
two species: meterious vora-
cia and m. tranquilla. The
former must be fedevery
hour or‘ two with small
change only, the latter, while
it must be fed to be kept
happy, requires less frequent
attention and is willing to
consume large fare.

University.

FELLOW STUDENTS, we
are about to become victims
j, of a foul and perﬁdious plot.
_No, the Communists are not
ta.ki-ng over Oakland, the
-{fascists are not entrenched
;.in the Cathedral, even creep-
‘-ting socialism pales in the
light‘ of this new menace———
'-the proliferation of parking
meters.
. The Modus Operandi of
__this ignominous scheme was
so simple that no one would
‘ever have expected foul play.
One day during the spring
term, secret agents of the
department of traffic control
,(DTC) appeared on campus
disguised as surveyors for
some new University build-
ing. They set up their trans-
its in the side streets off
--Fifth Ave., down Bayard,
even as far as the wilderness .
of Craig St. Once this dirty‘
deed -was done‘ the DTC could
land its ﬁrst wave of assault
troops. These came ‘in the
‘form of time worn; veterans
.and mere youths, many in
green Workman’s fatigues,
They came armed with ma.-
ichine sprayers and hand -
jbrushes. In a few short days
they swept through Oakland
leaving in their wake row

upon row of freshly painted
parking spaces. ‘

With their beach head es-
tablished the DTC called a
temporary halt in the esca-
lation of the conﬂict. Ac-
cording to informed sources
this cease ﬁre was designed
to dupe the commutersand
apartment dwellers into
thinking that the DTC was
performing a public service
by preventing parking space
hogs from taking more than
their fair share of the avail-

. able room.

BUT ALAS, what a. cruel
deception the lull turned out
to be. The returning stu-
dents were soon to ﬁnd out
the real motives of the DTC.
Feeling that the time was
ripe, the DTC dropped any
pretense of public service
and unveiled their true in-
tentions: the unholy exploi-
tation of the student who
drives. The arrival. of the
heavy artillery with its full
complement of jack ham-
mers and cement drills left
little doubt in anyone’s mind

i as to what would come next.
Sure enough the next morn- '
ing there they were, parking
meter stancheons.

The city has yet to put

Commuters with ﬁve hours
of classes in a row, science
majors with four hour labs,
pray for deliverance from
m. voratia. Parking mons-
ters are foul creatures at
best, but if they must be
here let them be meterious
tranquila. , -

 Editorial: Movement For A Union

project seems slight. Students could, however, be effectively used to col-
lect limited amounts from private donors for special purposes such as
furnishing lounges. In any endeavor of this type, the students should
have the guidance and aid of the professional fund raising staff retained
by the University.

But that is not the only door open. In other schools a Union Fee
has been levied upon the student body. Here students give a certain amount
of money (10-20 dollars per term) and these funds go toward the costs of
constructing a Student Union.

Anot-her method used at some schools is for the University to give
land to a private concern. This concern then builds the Union and gets back
the construction costs through rents paid by the University and through ‘
commercial concessions in the building. After a period of twenty to thirty
years the debt is paid off and the building becomes the property of the

Disorganization

Students should be thankful that their senators have chosen an issue
which can be worked on for the remainder of the trimester. It is a tangi-
ble channel for student enthusiasm, which can produce mainfoldbenefits
for the entire University community.

Where Is the Library?

THE PRESENT library
system at this school rep-
resents the most ineffective,
inefficient, messed -up con-
glomeration of nonsense that
this or any other school has
ever conceived.

One bad aspect of the sys-
tem is the lack of a decent
number of hours for student
usage. The 10 p.m. closing
time for the ﬁve main li-
braries is an inconsiderate
circumstance. A good library
would have extended hours.

Carnegie Tech, for exam-
ple, opens at 8 am. and
closes at 11:45 p.m. Sunday
through Thursday. And if

one cannot study at the li-

brary of his school where
can he study? The men and
women’s dormitories are too
noisy. Also, the Towers and
Student Union lobbies serve
more basic needs than that
of studying.

Furthermore, the problem
is not ‘only a quiet place to
study, but also one which is
comfortable and has neces-
sary facilities, for there is a
large part of Schenley Park
which is quiet. .

ONE AREA at the Uni-
versity which is frequently
used is the reserve book
room. This room is .not only
where many professors have
set aside large amounts of
course material, but it is also
the place where many li-
brarians spend their time
typing up forms to add to
the overﬂowing ﬁles. Trying
to read a paper on the philo-
sophical foundations of , rela-
tivity theory while someone,
is typing merrily away
across the room is not one
of the easier of life’s chores.

But the inadequate hours,
coupled with the typing are
only the beginning of the
libraries’ faults. In addition
to noisy typewriters, there
are noisy librarians. Several
librarians have long periods
of dedicated service which is
exceeded only by their long
periods of talking on the
telephone.‘ Having phones at
every desk in the 20-odd li-
braries might be convenient,
but it is not good for some-
one who is trying to work

 
  

%o[AIa-in’

 
     

By Robert Zavos

while the librarian chats.
The 20-odd bit also pre-
sents an interesting point.
This is possibly the only
building in the world that
has libraries scattered from
the sub-basement to the
22nd ﬂoor. There are at least
13 buildings other than the

Cathedral which house part '

of the University libraries.

THIS MAY, be great for
professors who dare not ven-
ture from their specialty,
but for students in interdis-
ciplinary ﬁelds it presents a
problem, especially when do-
ing research work. When the
library starts using its new
building next year,’ the sit-
uation will hardly improve
if only the basement, ﬁfth,
and sixth floors are moved.
The idea of having closed
stacks is now, and will in
the future, be a serious mis-
take if not corrected in the
new building.

Finally, I submit that the
classiﬁcation system now
used at the libraries is un-
necessarily complicated. The
Library of Congress System-
uses different letter ‘codes
for every conceivable area of
knowledge, followed by long
itiumber codes and more let-

ers.

On the other hand, the
Dewey Decimal System is so
easy that it is taught in
grade school. Everybody

knows that 92 is biography, .

100 is philosophy, 500 is sci-
ence, etc. If the librarians
claim that the Library of
Congress allows more readily
for new ﬁelds, they are miss-
ing the point—-or at least
they missed Algebra II,
which is quite probable in
the case of most librarians.
There is a rather elementary
mathematical theorem which
says that between any two
decimal numbers there are
decimals. .

If the new.building is not
used to organize and correct
many of these faults, then
this University can never
be better than a mediocre

~ school, since the library plays

such an important role in
the education process. '

Profs Comment

On Dorm Rules

Open Letter to MDC Concerning
th-e Dissemination of Information:

Life in a dormitory at best is
less than ideal, even if the roo-rns
are rectangular, and there is no
denying that the free distribu-
tion of written information may
be a nuisance at times. How-
ever, the restrictions which have
been placed upon the distribu-
tion of information in the men’s
dormitory at Pitt are, in our
opinion, a violation of the basic
principles upon which a univer-
sity is grounded.

These restrictions carried to
their logical conclusion would
eliminate the exchange of all
forms of written communications
such as lecture notes, newspa-
pers, magazines, letters, and even
lists of dormitory rules_. A uni-
versity is a forum for the free
interchange of ideas. Or as Clark
Kerr has stated, “The role of the
university is not to make ideas
safe for students but rather ‘to
make students safe for ideas.”

It follows from this that each
student must select from the in-
formation to which he is expos-
ed, those ideas he wishes to pur-
sue. Such choices are impossible

when ‘there is no exposure. But,
indeed, even no information is
preferable to the externally im-
posed bias of censorship. Certain-
ly groups of men far more edu-
cated and experienced in the
ways of the world than IVDDC,
have failed in attempts at en-
lightened censorship.

Perhaps certain restrictions on
the means of distribution are nec-
essary, such as registration of all
distributors and materials to be
distributed (without censorship),
special hours for distribution (se-
lected for the convenience of the
students, not the IVEDC) and re-

Finally, it does seems strange
that the MDC is advertising the
superiority of women in dealing
with the problems of the 20th
century. Perhaps in the women’s
dorms when they are not inter-
ested in a piece of information
they have received . . . they just
pick it up and throw it away.

END THE WAR IN VIETNAM

We the undersigned students and faculty of the'U-niversity of Pittsburgh oppose the US military inovlvement in
Vietnam, and the resulting de-emphasis of pressing domestic issues, such as the War on Poverty, civil rights, and education.
' We oppose the unnecessary slaughter of thousands of Americans and Vietnamese in a war to which there can
be. no military solution.
We call for:
I) an immediate cessation of the bombings in North and South Vietnam;
2) a ceasefire; .
3) negotiations with all parties concerned (including the NLF); , _
4) self-determination for the Vietnamese through implementation of the Geneva Acords of 1954;
5) withdrawal of US troops.

 Dances
Lack Something

Editor, The’ Pitt News:
Something is obviously lack-
ng at Pitt dances. The dance
’.7la_st" Saturday night was a ﬁne
4, example. Many people (mostly
 milled around outside the
:fSU Ballroom because the “host”
"-at the door would not permit
.75 them to enter. They had no col-
jlege. identiﬁcation. A Pitt com-
S muting student traveled 30 miles
‘-___t_o bring his girl to the dance but
l__iiwas turned away because his
lﬁdate was only a mere secretary
' and not of the elite college class.
Students from othercolleges, up-
on presentation of college identi-
 ﬁcation were permitted to enter,
._ while others of equal age and in-
telligence were sent away.

 .. What an impression of Pitt
1 they surely have! The sad part
is that there is no reason for
“this discrimination. Within the
.— SU Ballroom the majority of stu-
, dents (boys) stahd watching a
"dozen or so couples dancing while
_-the “unfortunate ones,” who
. could make the dance look less
. like a grade school function and
."more like a collegiate aged so-
 cial function, can only View the
 disappointing scene from the lob-
_;_.by. _Must we turn our noses up
to people and make them feel
like dirt because of our own sel-
 ﬁshness?

‘Operation’ Column
Hit By Student

Editor, The Pitt News:

I would like to make a few
comments on a column by Ho-
bart Harris which appeared in
the Wednesday, Sept. 28, issue of
The Pitt News under the head-
line “Operation Abolition Criti-
cized in New Film.” First, I
would like to dispute Mr. Harris’
statement that Operation Aboli-
tion “was produced to show
that the student demonstrations
outside of the San Francisco
hearings of the House Un-Amer-

LetterstotheEditor  

of committee hearings by peo-

ican Act_ivities- Committee were

Communist led and inspired.”
The original purpose of the
ﬁlm was to pictorially demon-
strate to Congress "the necessity
for the passage of legislation de-
signed to prevent the disruption

ple in and around the commit-
tee hearing room. To understand
the basis for the charge that_the—
attempts to disrupt the San Fran-
cisco hearings were Communist
led and inspired, it is ﬁrst neces-
sary to have anunderstanding of
the events which took place in
the few weeks immediately pre-
ceding the hearings. A good way
to begin to gain this understand-

ing would be to read J. Edgar

-_Hoov"er’s . ireport *' on’ this 3 ‘subj T

entitled. “Communist Target
Youth” (available from the U. S.
Government Printing, Office for
15 cents).

I would have hoped that the
students who were present at the
showing of the two ﬁlms would
have been perceptive enough to
realize that the only ﬁrm conclu-
sion one can draw from seeing
these two ﬁlms is that one or
both of these ﬁlms are lying. To
conclude more would require a-
research eifort of some propor-
tions to determine who is distort-
ing what._ Unfortunately, judging
by his column, it would appear
that Mr. Harris has judged Op-
eration; Correction to be true and
Operation Abolition to be false
only on the basis of having seen
both ﬁlms. ‘

that it he were to study the sub-
ject more fully he would ﬁnd er-
rors and misleading statements
in Operation Correction to pro-
vide material for another docu-
mentary ﬁlm designed to correct
Operation /Correction. Perhaps it
would be appropriate if I were

to give one example of what I’

mean by the errors and mislead-
ing statements in Operation Cor-
rection. I choose the following
example because it is one of the
few which can be discussed on
the "basis of no other information
than having viewed both ﬁlms.
I refer -to the demonstration in
the committee hearing room in
which a number of Communists
are standing in the front of the

hearing room, in effect, acting as
cheerleaders in a ‘shouting and

A preventing‘: the 'comrnitt_ee from;
conducting hearings. I It 

The’ narrator of Operation Cori
rection tells the ﬁlm audience,
that the students cannot be ac'-‘,
cused of any wrongdoing for:
taking-— part in this demonstra
tion because it occurred during,
the lunch time recess and, there-..'
fore, did not interfere with the’-1
committee’s hearings. The false?)
hood of this statement by 
narrator of Operation Correctio
is obvious for two reasons: 

(1) Very near to the beginnin ‘
of the ﬁlmed sequence -of the
demonstration you canghear th 
committee counsel calling forthe
next witness. (2) During the re-
mainder of the sequence you, can;
see the next witness sitting,
the witness chair waiting, to .tes
tify. Yet the Operation Correction"
narrator tells the audience that"
the demonstration took, plac
during the lunch recess. ..

I would hope that many ofth
students who viewed both, ﬁlm
would take the trouble to investi
gate further before coming _t
any ﬁnal conclusion as to -th
accuracy of either Operatic
Abolition or Operation Corre‘
tion. Further, I would hopetha _
college students would greeet 
political propaganda with]?
healthy skepticism, whether 
emanates from the Right,’ th
Center, or even (please -forgivf
me) the Left. '

  ‘Radical Theology and the Death of God’

yes of religions

\

By ROBERT ZAVOS
_ “I amprobably the only
radical Jewish theologian

' around here,” remarked Dr.

Richard L. Rubenstein in
the first lecture of his in-
formal course on “Radical
Theology and the Death of God”
which started Tuesday at Car-
negie Institute of Technology.

Dr. Rubensrtein ﬁnds two class-
in the world.
There are religions which have a
linear concept of time and des-
tiny and those which have a
circular concept.

The linear concept is employ-
ed by religions such as Judaism
and Christianity. Here, the pre-
vailing concepts are that man is
born and lives his life with an
ultimate goal. The goal varies
slightly between Christianity and
Judiasm and even within each
religion, but never-the-less there
is some ultimate, higher goal in

is no such thing as resurrection
or hope. “Pagan religions are re-
ligions of hopelessness,” stated
Dr. Rubenstein.

In Freudian terms, J udeo-Chris-

tianity employs a “father god,” _

while Pagan religions have a
“mother god.” “Father gods’ are
sky gods like Zeus,” noted Dr.
Rubenstein. “It is no accident
that Catholic priests are referred
to as ‘father.”’

Pagan religions use the “mo-
ther god” concept. The mother
god is the earth or the sea or the
womb. Man comes from the earth
and returns to the earth. Man
comes from the womb and re-

turns in the sex act. “When we
curl up to sleep it is because we
want to imitate the fetal posi-
tion from whence we come.” This
is why, Dr. Rubenstein says, pa-
gan religions have a circular time
concept. There is no “doctrine of
progress,” only a need to return
to nothing.

Dr. Rubenstein’s religion is like
the pagan religion. It is the one

New Kennedy Film Recalls
President’s Programs, Death

By CHARLES REINEB

Do you remember the day
when John F. Kennedy was kill-
ed? Do you remember how free-
ly the tears fell when you heard
of his death? If these things have
become the least bit blurry and
you're in the mood for a good
cry, I suggest that you see Years
of Lightning, Day of Drums, the
most recent entry at the War-
ner Theater.

Pehaps it is unfair to judge
this ﬁlm, originally produced for
the United States Information
Agency (USIA) for showing over-
seas, by the usual standards re-
served for ﬁlm critiques. After
all, the ﬁlm was produced to
promote good feelings for the
United States among our friends
abroad, not to give the American
movie-goer a “good cinema ex-
perience.” But even if the for-
mer possibility is the case, the
director and writer, Bruce Hers-
chensohn, used such primitive
means to achieve his objectives
that the ﬁlm must be critized.

The picture, which was nar-
rated by Gregory Peck, discussed
the six major objectives of the
Kennedy Administration: the Al-

liance for Progress, the War on
Poverty, the Peace Corps, Civil
Rights, Man in Space, and Peace.
After each facet of the program
was exempliﬁed through the use
of ﬁlm clippings of Kennedy's
speeches, which were mostly
from abroad, a tearful segment
of the funeral was shown. ,
I found myself starting to re-
member what it was like to have
Kennedy as President. After all,
there he was, up on the screen,
big as life. But just as Kennedy
was starting to cone to life, a
funeral scene was shown in or-
der to emphasize that he was, in
fact, very dead. The audience
needn’t have been reminded of
this awful fact -— certainly not
six times! Perhaps a straight-for
ward, objective documentary,
lacking obvious sentimentality,
would have been more suitable.
The USIA has produced a ﬁne
piece of propaganda and a great
tear jerker. If this was their rea-
son for producing the ﬁlm, they
have done a commendable job.
But if they wanted to show an
objective look into the adminis-
tration of John F. Kennedy, they

~ have failed.

Forum Highlights Weekend

(Continued from Page 1)
uate School of Public and Inter-
national Affairs. She is concen-
trating on the economic and so-
cial development of underdevel-
oped countries. Sister Taylor re-
sides in Tower C and is repre-
senting the students rather than

-her religion in this particular

event.

Explaining her feelings on this
subject she said, “although I
have lived on the campus for
only one month I have been
struck by the general interest in
religion by the students. I am
delighted to see so many of the
girls trying to ﬁnd something
meaningful in their lives. I also
believe this forum is important
because it shows that people are
interested in ﬁnding their own
concept of God . . . we are not
just anthropomorphising or_ ac-
cepting our parents’ concepts.”

In commenting on the entire
weekend, Chairman Linda Davis
said, “Many people say that Stu-
dent Government (SG) does noth-
ing and I want to emphasize that
the entire weekend is sponsored
by SG.” Publicity Director Peggy
Herschenson remarked, “‘We are
looking forward to a successful

_ weekend and all University or-

 

ganizations have been asked to
coordinate their activities with
us.’-

The program begins at 2 p.m.
today. Registration will be held
until 10‘ p.m. At 6 p.m. there will
be a pep rally on the Student

ception at 8 p.m. in the Cathe-

e~f*Break-away

Backs Face
Panthers

By GEORGE LIES

Garrett Ford, a throwback
to Jimmy Brown, should be
one to watch tomorrow at
the Stadium when the Pan-
thers continue the neighbor-
hood rivalry with the Mountain-

eers of West Virginia. That's it
a six-foot, 180 pound junior does-

,- ,n’t steel the scene.

.~;:\.

His name is John Mallory and
he’s their punt return man.
For the Panthers, two losses
have already been credited to
poor punt coverage. Mallory
could add to that. Last week,
against Virginia Tech, he ran 57
yards with a punt for a touch-
down. He also owns the longest
punt return of the 1965 WVU
team. It was 86 yards for a score
against George Washington. How-
ever, his 1965 return averageof
20 yards is almost double that
of this season.
What solutions to problems.
one of which will be Mallory

 starting at 1:30 p.m. tomorrow,
" did the Panther

coaches come
up with?

After a punt return for atouch-
down stopped the Panther vic-
tory bid in the California game,-
head coach Dave Hart asked,
“Why don't they sprint down-
field and tackle the runner?”

The reply was “'l'hat’s as fast
as they go.”

“This week we made a. few
adjustments on our punt game,”
defensive line coach Bill Neal
said in his Kentucky drawl. “We

. added more speed.”

“Ma1lory’s a tremendous punt
return threat, but after" what has
happened, A we worked a lot on
our punting game,” continued
Neal. “ (Aldo) Zortea’s punting
picked up tremendously in the
last game. This is what is ex-
pected. We hope/he continues the
pace.”

Last year at George Tech West

_ Virginia's new head coach Jim

~°f 77 attempts f

Carlen coached the ‘punt return
department which averaged 23
yards per run. But whether or

' not he relies on Mallory’s sudden
bursts, Carlin builds his I-forma-.

tion around the running ability
of Ford-. .

One of the nation's outstand-
ing‘ backs, Ford rushed for 192
yards _in last year's 63-48 ﬁasco.
In one quarter, he gained 133
yards. “Ford is the bigthing they
have,” said scouting coach Dar-
rell Lewis.

“He’s an excellent rimning back.
He picks daylight very well and
has the potential to go all the
way," Lewis said. This season
Ford has averaged 4.0 yards per
carry, gaining 277 yards. “He’s
dedicated to the game,” Carlen
says.

Where Ford is an inside run-
ning threat for the Mountaineers,
sophomore Steve Edwards offers
an outside running threat. On 19
carries, Duquesne, Pa.’s Edwards
has averaged 5.6 yards.

West Virginia supplements their
running attack with an average
Passing’ game. “They aren’t good
at quarterback.” scout Lewis
said. In fact John Finnerty, “one
of WVU’s two best pass 1-eeceiv.
ers must play cornerback be-
cause there is no one to throw
to him.” said Lewis. At WVU’s
tmilble Spot, soph Tom Digon has
thrown for 132 yards on eight.

‘a Soccer Team Hosts  

Forbes Field New Gamesite

By MIKE BROURMAN

It may be only of slight
consolation to the thousands
of fans who were ready with
their green Weenies, but the fact
that the Pirates are not in the
World Series is a big boost to the
soccer team.

Because the Bucs evacuated
Forbes Field earlier than they
had hoped, it has been made
available to the booters for their
game tomorrow with Ohio Uni-
versity, starting at 10:30 a.m.

Kennard Field, previous site
of the team’s home games, bears
more resemblance to the track at
Indianapolis than to soccer. ﬁeld.
Grass, a necessity in playing a
skillful game, is quite rare at
Kennard.’

As West Chester demonstrated,
Kennard can be used to advan-
tage if you play a long kick and
run game, as the balls have a
tendency to take off like they
are in third gear. But, the boot-

 ers play a short passing game,

and grass is needed if it, is to be

-effective.

Ohio’s style of play is-similar

to the soccer teams. The Bobcats’

got their ﬁrst taste of NCAA
tournament action last fall, and
this year coach John. McComb
says, “We have a lot of potential,
as good as any that we have

7 ever had.”

That potential is led by Sam
Roberts, an All-America center-
forward, as was Guy’ Busch of
MSU, who led to the defeat of
the booters last week.

This week, coach Leo Bemis
has been working his defense to
prevent the lapses that proved
so costly last Saturday. “We
made some defensive mistakes
last week, and we can’t make
them again,” he said.

If nothing else, the booters are
physically in better shape for the
game, according to coach Bemis.

0 The leg injuries to fullbacks Art

Richardson and Bill Zurzola are

much improved. Bemis also an-
nounced that either Terry Weil-
er or Gary Foertsch will open at
center-forward, replacing Ernest
Mouen.

The odor of the green weenie
is still fresh in the air around
Forbes Field. With it, and a bet-
ter defense, it may be the boot-
ers’ week. ,. s .

5 Another Day

Try to Ease Pressure

By Tom Sacks
Sports Editor

During their unsuccessful drive for the National League
pennant, the Pirates attempted to ease the mounting pres-
sure with such zany ideas as the Blue Maxes. Pressure is
also mounting on the Panthers. But their’s is a different
kind of pressure. It’s the pressure of whether they'll win
any game at all.

West Virginians have turned off their stills, leaving
the ‘hills for the city this weekend for their “Big” game.
Beating Pitt has always _been a matter of local pride for the

"denizens of the Mountain State. This year, with the Pan-

thers a two point favorite, is no exception.

And the Panthers are running scared. Jim.F1anigan,
Dewey Chester, Skip Orzulak, Greg Keller and John Schmidt
will all miss the game with injuries. _

“We have so many people hurt, we’ve been afraid to
have contact work in practice,” said Dave Hart.

West Virginia‘ has announced that they are so" thin
their travelingsquad will onlyconsist of 47 players. Hart's
answer was, “Well, we're so thin we won't even have 47
men and we’re the home team.” ' —

For two straight weeks the Panthers have been play-
ing over their heads. Hart claims he doesn’t know how
much longer they can do it.

In an attempt to alleviate the building pressure, the
coaching -staff has come up with a few new gimmicks.

The first one has been titled the “Prowling Panther
Award.” The Panther can be either an Offessive or—defen-
sive player. He is selected on his ability to get to the ball
with a certain amount of points credited for assists, tackles,
interceptions, recovering fumbles, causing fumbles, pass re-

; cepti-ons, picking the holes, and opening the holes.

Fifteen points is the magic number for an interior line-
man and -20,points for a back. Jim Flanigan was the only
one to make it in the Duke game. Brian Bubnis and Bobby
Dyer were honored for the Cal game.

A blue star is put on the helmet of each player that is
named a Prowling Panther.

‘In addition to the Panther award, offensive line coach '
Jim Royer has started a club of his own. This one is the _

“Top Hog’.’ award for the most outstanding offensive line-
man. Dave Randour was named the Top. Hog after the Cali-
fornia game. He received ablue and gold piggy bank.
