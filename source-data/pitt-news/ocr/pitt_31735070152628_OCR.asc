controversy

A new trend has arisen in college curri— A

cula of educating students about various
aspects of the climate crisis.

According to a poll from Gallup, 57
percent of Americans believe man—made
pollution is responsible for the increase in
average global temperature over the last
century. While thetide is certainly turn-
ing in’ terms of public acceptance of the
phenomenon, academics‘ have sought ways

to instruct students about the looming
dangers of climate change. At universities .

across-the country, professors have found
ways to blend literature, legal studies and
science. .

For example, a new graduate course of-
fered this winter quarter at the University
of Oregon taught by Stephanie LeMenager,
“The Cultures of Climate Change,” views
climate change through the arts, rather
than science. '

According to LeMenager, students
study a genre of speculative scientiﬁc
claims called climate ﬁction, or cli—ﬁ, that
anticipates how the phenomenon could

Her father’s early—onset Alzheimer’s dis-
ease has been a part of every day of Mariah
Streck’s life. He was diagnosed before she
was born. .

“Growing up, his disease progressed
and, I mean, it’s a very unique situation,”

Streck said. “We kept [my father] at home
as long as possible.” '

Streck’s father, Donald Streck, passed
away in March 2007 at the age of 64.

As a part of her ﬁnal project for nurs—
ing clinical hours, Streck, a senior nursing
major, .is creating a support group aimed
toward young adults aged 16‘to 25 who grew
up having a parent with Alzheimer’s. The

have Alzheimer’s. Early-onset Alzheimer’s
disease is rare, and only 5 percent of people
with Alzheimer’s are diagnosed before 65,
according to the Alzheimer’s Association
website. ‘

To extend the group’s reach beyond the
Pitt community, Streck plans to conduct sup-
port group meetings on Google Hangouts,
an online video chat service. Streck said she
hopes to increase participation across the
state of Pennsylvania through promotion in
medical publications and local news outlets.

Streck is currently in the process of re--
cruiting members to take part in the group’s
ﬁrst meeting on Wednesday at 7 p.m. on
Google Hangouts. ‘

Streck trained with the Research Center
to learn how to facilitate the support group
and is looking forward to the ﬁrst night.

“I worked alongside my mom as a care-
giver,” Streék said. “And it wasn’t something
I could easily explain or share with my peers,
because a majority of people know ['of the
disease] because of their grandparents.”

Donna Simpson, clinical research co-
ordinator at the Research Center, can also
attest to Streck’s experience.

“She also was here following our clinical
patients here at the Alzheimer’s Disease
Research Center,” Simpson said. “So she
also was able to interact with some of these
folks in this population.”

According to the Alzheimer’s Associa-
tion’s website, the organization hosts more
than 70 chapters nationwide and is devoted
to enhancing the care and treatment of the
disease’s sufferers.

nursing and medicine at Pitt’s School of
Medicine, acted as an administrative super-
visor over Streck’s clinical hours and Grow-

Emily Hikes spent Wednesday night recreat-
ing gory images —- including the heart, lungs
and a superﬁcial dissection of the neck -
with frosting on a cake.

“I didn’t sleep last night, and I destroyed
my shoulder stirring the icing to get it to the
right color, but everything turned out the
way it should,” Hikes said.

The University Library System’s Preserva- ’
tion Department, which archives and makes

library material available over an extended ’

period of time, hosted its second-armual Ed-
ible Book Fest at Hillman Library on Thurs-
day from 9 am. to 2 p.m. The Edible Book
Fest is held at libraries internationally in
April. Thirteen students submitted entries
to Pitt’s Book Fest this year, and 156 faculty
members and students voted for a winner.
Hikes, an archivist at Pitt’s Archive
Service Center, created her piece, “Gray’s
Anatomy,” with cake and buttercream ic-
ing for this year’s annual Edible Book Fest.
Hikes’ inspiration for her cake came from

her grandfather’s battered copy of Henry
Gray’s science textbook, which he has used
since 1942.

Hikes graduated from Pitt with a degree
in art history and participates in art shows
in her spare time, so she was eager to get
involved with the event.

“I wanted to do it last year, but I didn’t
have time, so I had to do it this year. I also

shape their future lives. Works include
novels by Nathaniel Rich and Daniel
Kramb, according to the class descrip-
tion. Students also studied cultural theory
that addresses how the arts can galvanize
political sentiment and action and read
cultural and sociological writings about
climate change denial.

LeMenager discussed the beneﬁts of
using ﬁction and art to understand the
possible scenarios for the future because
of climate change.

“I think ﬁction and imaginative works,
in general, offer us a safer place to try on
these scenarios. Because it’s ﬁction, we
feel like we can try it on, then go back into
the everyday. That kind of roleplay and
imagining is often very transformative,”
LeMenager said.

The course has been offered to only
graduate students so far, but LeMenager
said the course and the climate change
literature, Internet art and community
building stemming from the course could

’ be a helpful medium for teaching under-

graduates.

For LeMenager, instructing students
about climate change through academia
reminds them that one must create the
world in which he or she wants to live.

“There’s nothing more important than
reminding students of their power to co-
create a future, and it seems to me that
the emphasis on our agency to create a
world we want to live in has gone out of
education,” she said.

While Pitt doesn’t have a course that
fuses arts and the climate crisis, the Uni-
versity offers courses that follow the trend
of studying climate change.

Jennifer Smokelin, a professor in Pitt’s
law school, teaches a class offering a legal
perspective on climate change. “Climate
Change and the Law” deals with the "sci-
ence of global warming, as well as the law
of climate change and the interactions
between business and the climate crisis.

The course has been offered to law
school students every spring semester
since 2009.

Smokelin said understanding climate
change will be crucial to students’ profes-
sional lives.

“I think it’s imperative for students who

are looking at 20 years in the workforce
to have a solid understanding of climate
change. I think that it’s a fundamental
underpinning of a pillar of knowledge that
lawyers need to have,” Smokelin said.

Smokelin hopes a course in this vein
can be offered to undergraduate students
in the future. She added that a course for
undergraduates should focus on other as-
pects of global warming aside from the law.

Smokelin feels that understanding
climate changelaw has importance for
students. _ '

“[‘Climate Change and the Law’] has
to do with understanding this emerging
area of law and understanding the risks
and opportunities of this area and be_ing
able to capitalize on the opportunities and
avoid" the risks,” she said.

In addition to this different perspec-
tive on the climate crisis, Josef Werne, a
professor in Pitt’s geology department,
offers an undergraduate course called
“The Atmosphere, Oceans and Climate.”
This course provides a scientiﬁc view and
understanding on general climate change,
as well as anthropogenic climate change,
which is climate changecaused by in-
creased emissions of greenhouses gases,
or global warming.

Werne_said the course focuses on help-
ing students understand all aspects of the
climate. I '

“The basis of the course is under-
standing how the earth’s climate works.
We spend the vast majority‘ of -the course
learning about different aspects of the
course and how that drives the climate,
and then we talk in the last few weeks
about what humans have done that have

affected the climate,” Werne sai_d.

For Werne, climate change is a “key
factor that inﬂuences the lives of college
students” who may be affected by limita-
tions on food and water as a result of the
crisis. '

“A lot of the cities on coasts are affected

by rising sea levels. It’s going to be a big
issue,” Werne said. ;“It' may become the
dominant factor in the lives of students.”

He also added that without proper edu-
cation, students can’t fully understand the
impact of global warming.

“It’s a hideously complex thing,” Werne
said. “If you don’t understand how it works
at a fundamental level, you won’t know
how our activities as ‘humans affect it.” I

ing Up Purple. In addition to working at the
Alzheimer Disease Research Center, Lingler
sits on the board of the Greater Pittsburgh
Chapter of the Alzheimer’s Association.
With faith in Streck’s mission, Lingler
assisted her in forging connections with
people from the Alzheimer’s Association
and gaining their support for Growing Up
Purple. .
‘?[Streck] is using technology to bring

together people who are otherwise so iso— .
lated — and going through something that’s ’

such an isolating experience,” Lingler said.

“So that’s not easy to talk about among one’s

usual peer group.” i ,
Lingler will attend the ﬁrst meeting to

ﬁeld any questions beyond Streck’s knowl-
edge base. I _

Streck said the meetings will include a
brief informational session on one speciﬁc
aspect of the disease and will possibly fea-

ture YouTube videos and other technolo-

gies. _

The remainder of the session will be
open to discussion from the group. Streck
said her goal is to have enough members
to split the -discussion groups apaft into
subgroups based on age. I

“I think anyone with a family member or
a loved one who has Alzheimer’s —— it can
just be very frustrating,” Streck said. “So I
think the best thing that [group members]
will be able to do is just vent and have some—.
one to share stories with, and from there,
create tips and techniques on how to deal
with different behaviors.” I f

CAKE, 

 

Ashley Cox, an employee in the Preser-
vation Department, brought the event to
Pitt last year. The international‘ everltfbegan
in 2000 as a celebration ofjean An/thelme
Brillatesavarin, a French lawyer and7politi—
cian who wrote the famous food book §‘Physi-
ologieldu gout,” which was published in 1825.
It is held annually in April, the same month
as Savarin’s birthday. ,

‘Students whoparticipated submitted ed-
ible interpretafions of their favorite pieces
of literature. Approaches included the re-
creation of a book cover, scenes from abook
or the conception of a clever pun that plays
on the book. ,

The artists competed to win prizes in vari-
ous categories, including “overall favorite,”
“best interpretation of cover or scene” and
“most creative piece.” . .

* Learn Bridge won “overall favorite” with,

his “Giving Tree,” a tribute to Shel Silver-
stein’s children’s book, featuring a tree
stump made out of cake and fondant. The
.“most creative” award went to Emily Hikes’
“Gray’s Anatomy.” Justin P_ihony took “best
interpretation of a cover or a scene” for his
“Madeline,” which recreated a.London scene
from Ludwig Bemelmans’ children’s series
with ice cream cones forming a clock tower.

After staff members from the Preserva-
tion Department tallied the results and an-
nounced the winners, attendees indulged in
the homemade delicacies. ‘ - . I

Voters are also entered into a raffle to win
UniversityLibrary System prize baskets full
of gifts including umbrellas, hand sanitizers

and pencils, in addition to various hand— _

‘bound books.

 

Cox said most entries were dessert—based,

4 and this year’s competitionwas no exception.

The ending scene from “Divergent” by
Veronica Roth, an American novelist, was
re-created with cake mix,]ell— 0, evaporated
milk and icing. A pig face made of pancakes
represented Laura Numeroﬁ"s children’s
book, “If You Give a Pig a Pancake.”

Miranda Beck, asenior accounting major,
browsed through the entries and enjoyed
Hikes’ creation the most. ;

“I think Emily [Hikes’.] was the most re-
alistic and most creative. I can’t wait to eat
it,” Beck said. ‘

Juliana Warchola, a sophomore ﬁnance

major, appreciated “Gray’s Anatomy,” but_

she voted for another piece that was based
on Lee Tolstoy’s “Anna Karenina,” aRussian
novel published in 1877. The dessert featured
a banana representing a character from the
bookand a train made out of chocolate gra-
ham crackers and ‘chocolate doughnuts._
“My favorite is ‘Banana Karenana,”’ War-
cholar said. “Just because it’s so punny.”

Warchola said she was dragged to the

event by her friend Abby Shriver, a sopho-
more economics major who attended last
year’s event, and is already planning her

‘entry for next year.

Sarah Pomfret, a sophomore communica-
tion science and disorders major, was also
skeptical of the idea before she came.

“Now that I’m here, it’s really cool. I like
that we get to vote, it makes me feel more
involved,” Pomfret said.

According to Cox, the event was held dur-
ing ﬁnals week last year, and the Preservation
Department hosted the event earlier in the

semester; this year to accommodate more ~

students. The event drew 11 entries and 72
voters last year, and some of the favorites-in-

The-other week I received a text

me ifI knew where her oven '

a party the previous weekend
and had woken up to discov-

missing, so she was asking ev-

might know what had become

In case you were wonder-

went. Sadly, this isn’t a unique
problem. Vandalism and theft
are commonplace at college

like this can be costly, especially for
perpetually broke college students who
have to choose between extra groceries
or a night spent at Henmi'ngway’s.

‘ These party pranks are problematic
for several reasons. First off, stolen
goods or vandalized walls are never
as cool as you think they are. Flashing
stolen oven knobs to a bunch of girls
you meet at Sorrento’s isn’t impressive.
It’s lame. J

Stealing party souvenirs is like buy-
ing a car: Their value depreciates expo-

in this case, the party), and their value

ing hour. Maybe you’ll get a few chuck-

you may get a few smirks and bulging

Pitt needs  
wins against
Orange

Caitlin Hinsey
Staff Wrz'ter

In this ﬁnal stretch of the regular season,
every series and individual game gains im-
portance for any team as time runs out. But
for Pitt softball, which has moved in and

‘out of possession of the ACC’s ﬁnal berth in

its postseason tournament with regularity
of late, the emphasis feels especially great.

The Panthers will face former fellow
Big East member Syracuse in a three-game
series, beginning with a doubleheader on
Saturday afternoon and the ﬁnale on Sun-
day.

As a team, Pitt has struggled to build
and then sustain momentum throughout
the season. The Panthers haven’t strung
together more than three wins at a time,
and that has only occurred twice. They
also slumped a month ago when they lost
seven straight games, their longest losing
streak this year.

So after-producing little offense at Vir-
ginia Tech in the middle of the week to
drop a doubleheader and move down a
spot in the standings, the Panthers will
hope their up-and-down form continues
with an upswing by rebounding at home
to snap their two-game skid this weekend.

As the sixth-place team, Syracuse (15-
18, 6-7 ACC) would make the eight-team
conference tournament if the season ended
today, while after its two recent defeats,
Pitt (13-19, 4-9 ACC) sits right on the out-
skirts of qualiﬁcation in ninth place.

The Orange enter Pittsburgh with a two-
game winning streak. In its doubleheader
against SUNY-Binghamton on Wednesday,
Syracuse outscored the Bearcats 17-6, in-
cluding an 8-0 shutout. '

A marked difference in the squads’ of-

After dropping ﬁve out of its past six
ball games, the Pitt baseball team trav-
els down to South Florida to take on
No. 20 University of Miami in a three-
game conference series this weekend.
The Panthers, currently 16-16 over-
all and 8-7 in conference, lost two of
their three games this past weekend to
the top-ranked Virginia Cavaliers and
fell to Akron on Wednesday, 7-5. The
team is on a minor skid and hopes to
correct course in the Sunshine State.
Pitt will field its top three starting

pitchers in the weekend series, with
Australian senior Rhys Aldenhoven
(2-2, 3.52 ERA) going Friday, righty‘Joe
Harvey (2-1, 2.41 ERA) — who pitched
seven innings of two"-hit ball against
Virginia in the Panthers’ lone win last
weekend — on Saturday andésenior
Matt Wotherspoon (3-4, 5.96 ERA) will
start the ﬁnal game Sunday afternoon.

Despite the recent lack of success
for the Panthers, their pitching is not
to blame, as over the past 10 contests,
Pitt’s pitching staff ’s ERA has been 2.74
even with a 4-6 record in that span,
headlined by great recent performanc-
es by Harvey and Aldenhoven.

  Pitching    key Panthers vs. No. 20 Miami

That Panthers’ pitching staff will
have their hands full, however, with
a talented Miami Hurricanes lineup,
which ranks tied—for-fourth in the At-

- lantic Coast Conferencein home runs.

The batting order boasts talented hit-
ters David Thompson (.328 batting
average, .405 on—base percentage),
. Willie Abreu (.319 BA, .424 OBP), Dale
Carey (.280 BA, 5 HR) and Zack’Collins
 HR, 29 RBI). V
And while the ’Canes’ rotation isn’t
quite as good as Virginia’s was, it still
poses a formidable threesome of start-

The series marks the third-straight
conference series for the Panthers
' against a" ‘ranked opponent, after
sweeping then—No. 23 Georgia Tech
and losing two of three to the No. 1
Cavaliers last weekend. Pitt,’-who last
played the'Hurricanes in 2009, is 0-3

Pitt softball has struggled at “bat this year. Sheldon Satenstein |Assistant Visual'Editor

<éFRCC))Ml*ﬂl]_EB10I5‘\LL j

fensive output ﬁgures to have a big effect
on the outcome of the matchup.

Pitt has struggled to. score in past
weeks, as it ranks second to last with 108
runs in 32 games, 3.38 per contest.

Syracuse sits a spot above in the statis-
tical category, but has 52 more tallies after
having played just one additional. game.
The Orange have also amassed 11; more
total bases than the Panthers.

Further proof that Pitt’s bats haven’t
produced: The overall team batting aver-
age is a mere .240, the worst rate in the
conference, with more than half of the ros-
ter hitting below that mark individually.

A bright spot for Pitt is junior outﬁelder
Carly Thea. She is hitting a whopping . 397
for the season, and that success has her in
third place out of all ACC players in that
statistical category. She also has an active
nine—game hit streak. '

Freshman outﬁelder/ﬁrst baseman
Kaitlin Manuel also has an active hitting

.streak of -four games.

They will likely face freshman pitcher
Sydney-O’Hara (11-7), who has appeared
to feel more at ease on the mound of late.
Despite an ERA of 3.35, O’Hara tossed her
team-leading sixth shutout on Wednesday.
O’Hara:has limited base runners by strik-
ing out more than 100 batters, including
ﬁve in her last start. Opponents have aver-
aged .223 against her.

Syracuse has relied on its younger play-

’ ers to ‘secure wins at the plate. Its top hitter.
is freshman catcher Nicole Lundstrom.
Lundstrom bats .375 and has seven multi-
RBI games, as well as 12 multi-hit games
(including Wednesday’s doubleheader) to
lead the team.’ . —

Her teammates, freshman outﬁelderl
catcher Alyssa Dewes and sophomore
shortstop Corinne Ozanne, have also bat-
ted well. Dewesv bats .353 while Ozanne
has hit .343. For the season, Ozanne has
the second-most hits and RBIs, behind
Lundstrom. _

First pitch is 1 p.m. on Saturday at
Vartabedian Field in the Petersen Sports
Complex. 3 ,
