W’herein The City’s _
Department Of Health
Works Overtime . . .

By MELVIN ROGOW.

Wasserman blood tests ,being
made of 7,Uni,versity students, be-
gin in the Student Health Services,
but the large part of the work is
the result of careful, painstaking
analysis in the City of Pittsburgh
Health Laboratories.

In the health service, three to
fo five centimeters of the student’s
blood is drawn into a test tube.
Each night the blood specimens
taken during the day are delivered
to the city laboratories, where the
analysis begins.

The large number of tests being
made have taxed the equipment
of the laboratories to the limit.
Each test tube must be individual-
ly treated and analyzed, individ-
ual reports made to the students.
Although the laboratory facilities
have always been sufficient until
now, the great number of speci-
mens being delivered every day
from the University have prac-
tically monopolized the time of
the staff analysts, caused them to
work over time.

University Graduates

Members of the laboratory staff,
all University alumni, include
Dr. O.‘N. Eisaman, Dr. I. H. Alex-
ander, J. A. Walkowski, and Janet
Slease.

Dr. Eisaman, a medical school

graduate of 1906, took his under- ‘

graduate work at Penn State. For
19 years, he was head of the West
Penn and Passavant hospital lab-
oratories, on a part time basis. He
continued his private practice dur-
ing those years.

He has been connected with the
Pittsburgh Department of Public
Health for many years, but always
on a part-time basis, until three
years ago, when he gave up his
private practice, and became di-
rector of the City Laboratories."

Dr. Alexander, present head of
the Department of Public Health
is the seventh director under
whom Dr. Eisaman has worked.

Gives Up Trip

Concerning the University cam-
paign to have students take free
Wassermann tests, Dr. Eisaman
said, “I’ve never seen the likes
of it. Our usual average for Was-
sermann’s is about 200 a week, and
you have brought in close to 600.
This is an unusually good response.
I don’t believe that any other
school in Pennsylvania has begun
mass Wassermanns.”

Dr. Eisaman gave up a hunting
trip scheduled to begin last Mon-
day, because there was additional
work to be done on the University
students’ test tubes.

l\/LI‘. Walkowski, a graduate of
the College, 1930, spent six years
in laboratories at Mayview’ as lab-
oratory technician. While at May-
view, he worked under Dr. Fed-
erman, nationally known for his
work on syphilitic and insane per-
sons. In May of this year, he came
to the city laboratories, as assist-
ant chemist, and serologist.

“You have given us plenty of
extra work down here,” he com-
mented. “But I can honestly say
that I am really enjoying the work.
You students are showing a fine
spirit about this thing.”

Miss Slease, third member of the
analysis group, and a College
graduate of 1935, who received her
degree in. Bacteriology in 1937, has
been working w‘ith the city since
early last year as bacteriologist.

Miss Slease’s, main work deals
with the analysis and testing of
venereal diseases. “What the men
have said regarding your project
goes for me, too,” said Miss Slease.
“I am especially happy that my
Alma Mater has begun the Was-
sermanns and is carrying them
through so successfully.”

Cheering Block
Head Change
Policy

Rooters Turn
In Equipment
After Games

Although co-chairmen D. C.
Schultz, BA38, and VVilliam
McKenna, BA38, feel that the
cheering block was highly suc-
cessful in its ﬁrst fair trial of
the year last‘ Saturday at the
Carnegie Tech game, a new
policy in regard to distribution
will be continued at the two re-
maining games on the home sched-
ule.

Beginning with the Nebraska
game, Saturday, November 13,
section leaders will distribute
equipment at the beginning of the
game and will be responsible for
its collection and return at the end
of the game.

Students already in the block
are expected to remain in their
original sections, although any
who have not signed up but wish
to belong have only to apply to
any section leader for their equip-
ment. The equipment will be dis-
tributed to the ﬁrst 900 students
applying.

Advantages of the new system
are three-fold, according to Theo-
dore W. Biddle, assistant dean of
men. It does away with the
bother of carrying the uniforms to
and from games; assures a capacity
attendance in the block; and
places more responsibility on the
individual section leaders.

A meeting of all section leaders
will be held in 801 Cathedral to-
morrow at 3:30 o’clock. Attend-
ance is compulsory.

Dr. Reiser

Will Address
SFA Forum

Recent interest in mental tele-
pathy as a psychological possibil-
ity will be analyzed and discussed
Friday by Dr. Oliver L. Reiser,
associate professor of philosophy,
in the third of the SFA-sponsor-
ed series of Student—Faculty for-
ums.

Subject of Dr. Reiser’s address
will be ‘Extra-Sensory Percep-
tion?” The meeting, open to all
student and faculty members of
the University, will be held in 8
Cathedral from 1 to 2 o’clock.

The speaker indicates that he
will proceed along philosophical
and psychological lines.

Extra-sensory perception, or, as
it is popularly known,_mental tele-
pathy, is propounded by its theor-
ists as “thought transference;”
many scientists brand it as pure
coincidence.

Current popularity of the sub-
ject has been encouraged by radio
programs, under the direction of
th University of Chicago, which
seek to obtain experimental evi-
dence for the hypothesis.

Dr. Reiser’s address will follow
in the year’s series of forum pro-
grams after programs led by Dr.
Carroll R. Daugherty, professor
of economics, and Philip C. Elliott,
associate professor of ﬁne arts.

‘Fresh Fields’
Opens On Foster

Memorial Stage

Presenting thé'f;nglish comedy.
“Fresh Fields,” Pitt Players will
make their ﬁrst campus appear-
ance of the season tonight and to-
morrow night at 8:15 o’clock in
the Foster Memorial.

Starring in f‘Fresh Fields” are _

Ione Williams, Ed39, and Helen
Akerman, Ed38, as the sisters,
Ladies Lillian and Mary; Bill
Hoeveler, C39, plays young Tim.
GOOD CLEAN FUN .

Phyllis Post, Ed39, from Frick
training school, will take the part
of Una, the Australian lass, while
Roberta Webb, Ed39, also from
Frick, is her mother, Mrs. Pid-
geon. Lady Strawholme, friend of
the English sisters, will be Shirley
Rugh, C38; Tom will be Bill Kun-
kel, BA39; and Ludlow, the butler,
Rex Loder, BA40. Completing the
cast is Elizabeth Moulton, Ed39,
playing Miss Swaine.

“Fresh Fields” is a comedy
about an Australian family and a
group of genteel Londoners, and,
when the two groups clash, there
is plenty of clean fun ahead for
the audience.

SITUATION FUNNY

The clumsy manners of the vis-
itors and the hauteur of the aris-
tocrats are skillfully presented by
the Players’ cast, directed by Carl
Cass, assistant professor of Eng-
lish.

The situation in “Fresh Fields”
is highly packed with laughs, if
the New York Mirror can be be-
lived: “Much robust laughter was
caused by the hilarious hokum of
‘Fresh Fields.’ The audience was
immensely amused. Not only did
they laugh, but loud—they actual-
ly rocked.”

Tickets are 50 cents for students
and 75 cents for outsiders. Sea-
son tickets are one dollar and
$11.50, respectively, for three
shows. They may be procured in
1617 Cathedral today. ‘

gram.

The “Apprentice” is rated as one
of the most original of modern mu-
sical compositions. Dukas, who
died last year, was interested in
the musical possibilities of an old
German legend, which has to do
with the magical powers of a cer-
tain broom. This broom, when
commanded by a competent sor-
cerer or magician, would fetch un-
limited quantities of water until
ordered to stop. -

A certain apprentice knew only
the beginning words of the charm,
but did not know how to stop the
broom from drawing water from
the spring. He succeeded in ﬂood-
ing his master’s house, and it was
only when the magician returned
that the broom was stopped. Using

ference on peace in February and
the conclusion of the series during
anti-war week in April.

 

Statement From
University

The committee in charge of
the Community Fund has asked

for the use of the Commons
Room for the opening dinner of
the campaign. The success of

this effort is of such importance
to the community that the
University felt it a privilege as
well as an obligation to co-oper-
ate. Our conﬁdence in the stu-
dent interest in the success of
the Community Fund Drive led
the University to assure the
committee of‘ our cooperation ‘
and-, of the willingness of‘ the ~
student body to forego the, use
of the Commons Room during
the period of preparation for
the dinner.

In. order to make adequate
arrangements, it will be nec-
essary to start preparations in
the Commons Room this morn-
ing. This will result in some
inconvenience to the student
body from today to Saturday.

Quill Club Hears
Readings Tonight

Anonymous manuscripts will be
read at tonight’s meeting of Quill
Club, honorary literary fraternity.
The meeting will be held at 8:15
o’clock in 1001 Cathedral. V

Members are asked to turn in
their manuscripts to Marion Conn,
C40, program chairman.

To Take Free

Wassermanns

Health Services

Urge Professors
To Back Drive

In a joint statement, releas-
ed yesterday, the health serv-_
ices issued a blanket invitation
for all faculty members totake
the free \Vassermann tests.

“If faculty members will
take the test, it will provide an
extra example to the student
body,” the statement read. “Though
it is unlikely that analysis will
show any positives, faculty people
should show that they are behind
the anti-syphilis campaign being
waged nationally, and locally by
The Pitt News.”

All tests are given by the stu-
dent health services; the men at
Falk Clinic, the women in 825
Cathedral.

That the tests are not entirely
new on campus is shown in a re-
port made to The Pitt News by
Dr. J. S. Oartel, assistant profes-
sor of histology and bacteriology
in the School of Dentistry.

Syphilis detection tests have
been routinely given to all stu-
dents in Dental School at the end
of their junior year since the in-
stitution of the plan in 1931.

In that time, on a compulsory
basis, 434 students have been ex-
amined. Of those examined, only
one was found to be infected, and
a successful cure was effected in
that case.

Blood analysis for the Dental
School is done by the department
of bacteriology of the School of
Dentistry.

The plan being used here now,
sponsored by The Pitt News, is
being carried on in cooperation
with the student health services,
and the City of Pittsburgh De-
partment of Public Health. The
City laboratories are doing all
analysis at no charge, contrary to
their usual practice.

Former Record

One hundred and eighty men
pledged to 15 fraternities at the
conclusion of fall rushing Rob-
ert R. Corley, assistant dean of
men, announced late Monday
afternoon.

This is an increase of 11 men
over last year ’s results for the
same period. The increase is
probably due to the larger num-
ber of ‘bids submitted by the fra-
ternities, he said. Six hundred
twenty-four bids were submitted
for 406 individuals as compared
to 619 bids for 396 individuals
last year. ‘

THIRTEEN PARTICIPATE

Largest number of- pledges was
garnered by Phi Delta Theta with
23 freshmen. Tied for second
place were Phi Kappa and Pi
Kappa Alpha, only one behind
with 22 each. Phi Epsilon Pi ran
third with 16.

Thirteen fraternities in Interfra-

ternity Council rushed and bid
men. Alpha Phi Alpha, social fra-
ternity not in Council, and Kappa
Alpha Phi, listed as business ad-
ministration fraternity, also rushed
and bid according to “the same
rules. —
Last year the high number was
26 pledged by Phi Epsilon Pi;
second high was Delta Tau Delta
with 20 men. Tied for third place
was Phi Kappa. and Phi Gamma.
Delta, with 19 apiece.

From the close of silence week
at 5 o’clock Monday until Decem-
ber I no new students, freshmen
or transfers, may be bid or
pledged, although rushing is per-
mitted. After December 1 bids
may be submitted and men
pledged with no restrictions.

Whispering Campaign I
Answered In Full

A totally unfounded whispering campaign
- - making the rounds on campus calls for a
repetition of much that has been said in these
columns on the current program to get. all
University students to take free Wassei'inann
tests at the‘ studentwhealth services.

According to-the, whispers which are par-
ticularly prevalent, We are told, in the ranks
of University Woinen, students who take the
test and show a positive reaction,‘ 1ndicat1n_g
that these persons have syphilis, Will have this
placed on their student health records,
thereby making it impossible for them to ob-
tain jobs. '

This rumor, as stated repeatedly in these
columns and in the news stories of the cam-
paign.  totally unfounded.  

Res_ults_ of,- the present campaign will be
 only to the student health directors,
Dr. Auleene M. Jamison and Dr. H. C11591'd
Carlson who will divulge the information
only to the. students who take the test.

Students who fear? that they could not ob-
tain employment if their tests show positive
and the facts become known to prospective
employers are reminded that most employ- V
ers subject applicants to a. complete physical
examination before. liiringthem.

If the student wishes to be sure that he
will not be rejected later because of syphilis
infection, there is all the more reason for
taking part in the campus program now.

At any rate, the rumors noted’ above are un
true. Participation in the free Vllassermann
program can be nothing but beneﬁcial even to
the very few students whose tests may show a
positive reaction.

Invitation to faculty members, extended yes-
terday by the student health services, to take
part in the program of free VVassei'mann tests
carries the campaign nearer the ultimate goal.

expressed a decided interest in the program is
encouraging. I To them and to the student ,

that often things for me are just too much.

Temggratnentgl Trivia.‘

The other day I saw a very sad thing.

It was one Friday afterno.on—we won_’t be tech-
nical about the time, but say around jive-thirty or
six o’clo.Cl:<~.ar;d 1 was riding on .a street car. ‘Shore
was a man sitting next to me, a man who had
evidently been working hard, because he hail“ on
oldish clothes and his"li”aﬁds"‘were dirty. (I“‘gues's
ll‘? had been working hard; he dic_ln’t 1991.5 like a
WBA worker.)

So he was sitting there, just about asleep, and a
woman got on the car. She was quite fat and very
rouged, and she had a package in her hand. It
wasn’ta big package—it looked like a package of
handkerchiefs, but you never can tell.

So she got on, and she stood in front of the man,
and he almost asleep by this time, and she stood
there, And she stood there. And she stood there.

And the man didn’t stand up for her. He didn’t
give her his seat!

I can’t understand it.

I saw something else sad, the other day.

It was on Saturday, at the Tech game. This time
it really was sad.

and they were so anxious to get back into the game,

that they felt it necessary to walk through the band_

to get to the benches.

Now, far be it from me—-reactionary though they
call me—-to hold any brief for school spirit, dig-

Shawn Discusses

American Dance

By Lois; Loomis

“The difference between a log cabin and the
Cathedral of Learning may be likened to the_ differ-
ences between the modern dance as we see it today
and its presentation 50 years from now,” prophesied
Ted Shawn over the footlights of Carnegie Music
Hall last Friday night.

An enthusiastic audience was reluctant to let him
go after he and his ensemble of men dancers had
presented “O, Libertad!,” an American saga in three
acts. He did not give an encore but returned in-
stead to speak of the American dance and its fu-
ture.

One of his greatest dislikes, he continued, is the
barrier, created between the dancers and the audi-
ence by the stage upon which the dancer must per-
form. In his summer training camp in Massachu-
setts visitors are invited to the huge barn where
the dances are presented informally once a week.
Here, he feels that the ideal is nearly achi_eved——-
those who watch are drawn more intimately into
the dance and come to feel that they are participat-
ing themselves.

The three acts of “O, Libertad!” represent the
past, the present, and the future. Shawn’s ﬁnale,
his increasingly well-known “Kinetic Mo1pai,” is
an expression 0.f creative endeavor derived from an
ancient art form. Here, the composer believes,
America will reach its greatest art expression and
evolve a form of the dance for the American man
of the future.

His presentation of strife, opposition, and some
of the simpler movements were not difficult to
recognize and understand. But resilience, dynamic
contrast, solvents, are conceptions which we proba-
bly will have to be educated to appreciate. The
sane. thing is to accept “Kinetic Molpai” only as

Mr. Shawn offers it—an art creation deﬁnitely ahead.

Mr. Hovey thinks that the

Pierre Bonnard still contributing
notable work. -

“However, there is no excuse for

of them have achieved the stamp
of topnotch national elevens.
Both Notre Dame and Nebraska
showed Bernie Bierman’s boys
howdro. spells defeat, something
that had been deﬁnitely unfamil-
iar to the Gophers in recent years.

In last week’s great triumph 0

over .a highly favored Minnesota
team, Notre. Dame showed that
‘the Irish are back on the old
Rockne trail and that they know
.how to really play football. Beat-
ing a team as strong and potent
-..as the Gophers is sufficient testi-
smony for any team.

DAUGHERTY IMP-RESSED

Dr. Ralph Daugherty, who
:.schools the Pitt centers and who
.does, a powerful lot of scouting
for Dr. Jock Sutherland, has been
"taking notes on the Irish in all of
:their important games this fall.

He was none too over-joyous as
‘he reported back Monday. “I1
‘wasn‘t quite convinced of the No-»
tre Dame possibilities» this year
:u.nt.i_1. last. S.aturday- Then I Was-
.more than impressed. Notre Dame
has been traveling a road up-
wards this season and each game
they have shown deﬁnite im-
provement. '

“Highly rated before the season
opened, they have ﬁnally come
into their own. Against Minnesota
they were a really ﬁne ball team.
And I can tell you this, much——
‘Pitt can’t afford to fumble
against the Irish.”

IRISH GETTING HOT

Notre Dame’s record, not too
impressive, indicates that they
have something on the football in
:addition to the proverbial prayer.
‘They opened against Drake and
set the Bulldogs down with a 21-
'0 shellacking.

Their second contest against
Zuppke’s Illinois outﬁt was
played on a muddyxﬁeld in the
rain, on a day that vwas hardly
conducive to any scoring and nei-
ther team did. A spirited Tartan
team, although statistically out-
played, nevertheless, had one sta-
‘tistic to their good. That was the
score, and the Tartans accom-
plished an upset. of. national pro-
portions by winning, 9-7.

The Irish came back against a
hardy Navy team, conquering
them, 9-7, and more important, in
that game they uncovered a tal-
ented left-halfback, Jim McCar-
thy. This is a good omen, for the
‘Notre Dame records of great
years always were made when
there was a good man in that P0-
sition.

GOOD BACK-S

Against the Gophers, the Irish
demonstrated that they had come
all the way. Their defense was
greatly strengthened and they
have more than an assortment of
ﬁne, offensive backs. “Handy An-
dy” Pupulis was the star of the
"Gopher game and he, like Cassi-
ano, is only on the second team.

Then, in addition to the phys-
ical attributes of the Layden team,
is the healthy for them, unhealthy
for the Panthers, attitude with
which they will approach Satur-
day’s game.

Since they began training last
spring, there has been one thing
that they have been thoroughly
drilled with. They know it by
rote and they know it by instinct.
That is, that the Panthers lam-
basted them last year, 26-0.

IRISH WANT TO WIN

Knowing the Irish pride should
be enough to realize,_that once
they become ruffled, they are ruf-
ﬂed. Elmer Layden and his boys
would take no "greater pleasure,
they hardly ask for anything else
than to sock it back to-those Pan-
thers.

The Panthers resumed practice
on. Monday and hope to be in good
physical shape by the week-end.
Goldberg and Daddio, key men of '
the Panthers, spent the past Sat-
urday and Sunday in complete
rest. They didn’t play in the Tech
game and took a 48-hour rest cure
in the hospital immediately after-
wards.

Frank Patrick’s ankle was badly
mauled and he is hardly in the
best of condition. Don Hensley
is still suffering from a back in-
jury in the Wisconsin game. The

This Week,-End

Cross country is not like base-
ball.

With the count four and none
the» Panther cross country, runners
should be taking a walk this week,
but instead they have the big; one
coming up. '

The Pitt boys hold four one
sided victories over-Bethany, Pur-
due, Wayne: University, and Tech,
but they-have to meet Penn State
this Friday afternoon at State Col-
lege. ' V

Although the Panthers nosed out
the Lions by a close 25-30 score
last year in Schenley Park, Coach
Carl Olson is very gloomy this
week anticipating a thorough
trouncing from the Mount Nittany
boys.

Possibly Olson has reasons for
taking a- gloomy attitude. For,
when the factors of the meet are
examined objectively everything
shapes up in the favor of the
Lions-—that is, on paper. You can't
tell what will happen when the
boys get out on the cinders.

ONE OLSON VETERAN

Except for one man the Penn
State lads have the same team
that ran against the Panthers last
year. Olson has one veteran, Al
Zamborski.

Besides having a whole team
full of veterans, Penn State has
a flock of sophomore runners
from the crack ’36 freshman har-
rier outfit. These freshmen de-

feated the Pitt freshmen by a
perfect score last year. Olson’~s
team is composed chiefly of

members of last year’s freshman
team.

Furthermore, Penn State has
one of the fastest cross country
squads in the country, year in and

year out. This year’s team is no.

exception. With veterans such as
Captain Olexy, who took second
place in the IC4A cross country
championships last year, Pearce,

Clark, Maule, Gordon, Tipton and-

a pack of star sophomores the
Lions will be plenty tough.

But Olson has been able to sal-
vage one ray of hope that his
Panthers might come through.
Last week Syracuse scored an up-
set over the Lions by defeating
them 19-36. Olson hopes that if
the Panthers get up early enough
they may be able to upset the
Penn State cart for the second
week in a row.

The Panther freshman team
will meet the Penn State fresh-
man in a freshman run just before
the varsity boys stride into ac-
tion. Olson is expecting a close
meet here because both the Pan-
ther and Lion cubs- are excep-
tional first year college harrier
squads. "

Harriers

Win Three

In four days the ﬁrst-year men
won three cross country meets,
two dual meets and one triangular
affair.

Monday afternoon the Panther
yearlings defeated the Taylor All-
derdice cross-country runners by
a perfect 15-40 score to add one
more link to their long string of
victories.

Last Friday in a dual meet with
the Aliquippa and South Hills
high school harrier squads, the
Pitt freshmen took first place, easi-
ly, by compiling the lowest score,
17 points. Saturday the boys “did

Coming directly from Mr. Robert

due to a general leveling off of

in the two brackets.

Typical of interfrat frays will be
the opening battle between SAE

In the other lid-lifter Sigma

Sigma Chi pulled one of the
major upsets of the season last

next time out. '

Blond George Clifton and head
cheerleader Earl Riley will be in
the Sigma Chi lineup to harass the
Sammies.‘ In their only win last
season these two piled up the ad-
vantage needed. to throw Phi

The Sammies in their only

coaches Bob Schooley and Len
Broido put a squad of thirty
through their initial paces.

Answering the ﬁrst call were
some ten or twelve icemen of last
year’s outﬁt and the balance of
the thirty to report were all new
men. Minus equipment with. the
exception of skates and sticks of
course, the boys put in a spirited
session with every man getting a
good workout.

It is altogether too early to real-
ly get a line on the boys, but off-
hand observers at the garden put
their 0. k. on the spirit and will-
ingness the Pitt boys showed.

By the end of this week Schoo-
ley and Broido expect to have
weeded the squad into three or
four possible combinations. From
this they will "select a ﬁrst and
second sextet and have practice
games. ' '

Malone Advocates

Candidate

Tells Inquiry _

Of City Deficit

VVhat Pittsburgh needs is a
group of independent public

officials and a government un-
bossed by political parties.

That is the opinionof James F. A

Malone, Jr., Republican candi-
date for City Council, who ad-
dressed a small group of students
Monday at Inquiry Forum.

In an election-eve discussion of
the campaign, Mr. Malone declared
that one of the most serious threats
to city government is the power
of boss-run political parties. To
counteract this inﬂuence, he urged
greater public interest in electing
competent, independent ofﬁcials.

As an exabple of unreasonable
party domination of government,
Mr. Malone cited the political
career of former mayor William N.
McNair:

CITY MANAGER

“Four years ago, the people
elected McNair. He was honest,
had a-_ mind of his own, and tried
to run the city according to his
ideas. When he wouldn’t follow

their orders, the Democratic lead- V

ers did everything in their power
to hamper him; the Democratic
majority in City Council blocked
his plans.

“Then the organization spon-
sored a city- manager plan for
Pittsburgh in the state legislature.
Whether they did that in the in-
terest of the people, or to get rid
of McNair, you can judge. But I
will say that the city manager
plan hasn’t seen the light of day
since McNair resigned and the
Democratic organization elected
Scully mayor.”

Election of members of City
Council is more important to the
people of Pittsburgh than is the

‘choice of a mayor, said Mr. Ma-

lone. Council decides on the city
budget, and ﬁxes the tax millage
which must be paid, he explained.

$2,000,000 DEFICIT

Despite the fact that the city’s
tax rate for 1938 has been set by
Council as the same as this year’s,
taxes for next year must be in-
creased no matter who wins the
election, Mr. Malone claimed.

“The city can’t go on ﬁnancially
the way it has been going the
past six or eight years. Statistics
from the city contro1ler’s ofﬁce
prove that the city has a deﬁcit of
$2,000,000,” he said.

“It is true that there will be a
cash surplus at the end of the
year. But the city has been bor-
rowing money from banks to meet
current expenses, using as col-
lateral the unpaid delinquent
taxes. And there is still outstand-
ing a matter of $2,000,000 worth
of short-term bonds.

“To meet payroll increases voted
by Council this year, about $625,-
000 has been transferred from the
garbage and rubbish collection
funds. While it is true that the
city has ‘cash on hand, at budget
deﬁcit still exists.”

‘Found

A man’s wrist watch was found
on Monday, Nov. 1, on the
eighth ﬂoor, Cathedral. The watch
is now in the possession of E. B.
Williams, director of placement
bureau for men. The owner may

ing it.

Boston and Columbia universities,
will lead an institute on these
topics tomorrow at 4 o’clock in
the Y clubrooms, Forbes and Bou-

Concert Hour

(Continued from Page 1)

of the broom as it runs from the
spring to the house, Dukas has
constructed a musical epic that is
one of the most popular pieces at
symphony concerts today.

The Handel piece possesses much
interest, exclusive of its novel
character. Handel, although a
good churchrnan, did not hesitate
to steal themes from works by his
contemporaries, and many of his
concertos and suites are really
potpourris decorated with the
genius of the matter-of-face Ger-
man. Eighteenth century Lon-
don was often disturbed at night
by Handel on his way to an
author’s house to ﬁnd a corre-
sponding English word for a Ger-
man one which he wanted to use

in an oratorio.

Toscanini will complete today’s
program with his interpretation of
the Beethoven symphony. This
symphony is unique in that the

last movement, based on Schiller’s

“Ode to Joy” uses a vocal chorus.
Toscanini is considered one of the
greatest conductors and authori-
ties on Beethoven’s symphony mu-
SIC.

Xylon To Hold

Open Forum

In order to encourage a greater
interest in journalism among Uni-
versity women, Xylon, women’s
honorary journalism fraternity, is
sponsoring an. open forum Mon-
day from 3:30 to 5 o’clock at Heinz
House. ,

Maxine Christensen, secretary
to Robert X. Graham, director of
the University News Service, will
discuss women’s place in campus
publications.

Publicity chairmen of all wo-
men’s organizations on campus and
women members of all campus
publications are expected to at-
tend the forum. Anyone else who
is interested, however, may come
i0 “1¢:-m9§¥i¥§S-

Under the direction of Lea Gold-“
stein, C39, chairman of the Unit
Advisory Council of WSGA, a new
unit has been added to the pre-
vious list of nine. The Camera
Art unit will feature its year’s
work by putting out a “Freshman
Life” magazine, consisting of some
of the snapshots and pictures that
members of the unit have taken.
Trick photography, such as study-
ing unusual moving-picture shots
and making up weird effects with
their own pictures will be included
in the unit’s work.

A new angle on an old unit is
being introduced in the Current
Literary Review unit. Current
books will be discussed, new plays
reviewed, and both taken apart,
criticized, and put back together

again by this unit.

Freshman Women
Must Decide On Units

Future members of the Pitt
Players will ﬁnd their place in the
Acting unit. With four or ﬁve one-
act plays already on schedule for
the unit, such odd moments as can
be found will,/be taken, up ,with
studying scenery, costumes, and
make-up.

Not only will French be spoken
at meetings of the French unit, but
French games, songs, and even
crossword puzzles will have their
place. “Les Pittites Francaise,” a
newspaper written entirely‘ in
French by members of the unit,
will top the year’s activities.

Members of the Glee Club unit
will lead the class in singing at
meetings, take an active part in
their class skits for the Interclass
Sing, and compose some original
songs and musical skits this year.

Plans for the Publications unit
include the publishing of a min-
iature “Panther” and the “Fresh-
man Review.” Newspaper make-
up, headlines, and journalistic
style will conclude the unit’s pro-
gram for the year.

To learn to speak naturally and
correctly, whether in a speech or
an informal discussion, is the pur-
pose of the Public Speaking unit.
Voices of members of the unit will
be recorded and criticized some
time during the year.

Women interested in any phase
of stagecraft from make-up to
actual direction ' will ﬁnd their
place in the Stagecraft unit. Tours
backstage of the Playhouse, Nixon,
and the Stephen Foster Memorial
will be conducted.

“There’s nothing like writing to
make you a better writer,” is the
motto of the Writing unit. There-
