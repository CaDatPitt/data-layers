TALLAHASSEE, 'Fla.—A
tremendous hole was blown
through Pitt’s‘ once ballooning
hopes for a national championship
Saturday as the Panthers were
soundly defeated by Florida State,
36-22. ' ' '

The Panthers dominated the ear-
lygoing of a game which most ex-
pected to be a defensive struggle,
leading at‘ the end of the first
quarter 7-3, but the fumbles started
to fall in the second quarter and
FSU went ahead to stay. Twenty of
Florida State’s points came after
Pitt turnovers.

“You can’t win by making
mistakes and turning the ball over
as many times’ as we did,” said
coach Jackie Sherrill. “Defensively
they wore us down. The punting
and field goal kickers put a lot of

pressure_on us.”

. state senators and 203 state House
members.
. At the top of the ticket, no one
has pulled away from the field.
“We anticipate it being very
close,” said Daniel Horgan, Presi-
dent Carter’s state coordinator.
Despite early disaffection among
their traditional black and union
supporters, Democrats expect
everyone back in the fold for Carter
by election day. ' _
“We’re going to reinvent the
Democratic Party,” Horgan said.
Meanwhile, Republican Ronald
Reagan’s forces contend the states’s
economic problems, unemploy

and inflation, are too serious for a
Carter comeback.

There’s a perception of the depth
of the problem and that Ronald
Reagan as a potential solver of the
problem is coming through,” said
his state coordinator, Richard Fox.

Republicans say they are attrac-'
ting blue collar workers and will‘

make off with sizeable sections of
the Democratic vote. ’
“There’s a growing perception of
a lack of leadership, that Carter
lacks credibility,” said Fox. “We’re
seeing Democrats indicate they’re
going to vote for Ronald Reagan.”
The latest Gallup poll gives

Reagan a 40-33‘ edge statewide, bas-

ed on a 51-21 advantage in the
Republican suburbs around
Philadelphia and a 42-33 lead in the
rural areas. _ 0

Meanwhile, Carter who needs to
win by at least 150,000 votes in
Democrat-rich Philadelphia, leads

' -in the city 35-29. Fox believes

Reagan bottomed out in Penn-
sylvania during September and will
keep rising. , _
“There’s been a slow turnaround
and my perception is that the
momentum isincreasing, but it’s a
long way to Nov. 4,” said Fox.
Although both Carter and
Reagan_ count Anderson out, the
‘Gallup poll gave him 20 percent in
Philadelphia, enough of a following
to jeopardize Carter’s‘ chances.
Jane Fowler, Anderson's Penn-
sylvania coordinator, feels the bit-
between Carter and
Reagan will add needed fuel to
Anderson’s‘ campaign.
In addition, Anderson will start a

a

television ad campaign this week, ~

she said. . .

Republican Specter and Democrat

‘Flaherty started their campaigns

over the summer.-

Specter, well known in the

Philadelphia region from his. years
as city district attorney, must build
a name for himself in the rest of the
state. .
Meanwhile Flaherty, who blew a
large lead in the 1980 gubernatorial
campaign, set about mending the
fences he split when he shunned
party officials two years ago. '

Asked if Flaherty, has had success
healing those wounds, one
Philadelphia official replied, “ab-
solutely.”. But in Philadelphia, the
place where the machine would help
him the most, Flaherty must con-
tend with Specter’s hometown ad-
vantage.

While Specter leads in a recent
Gallup poll in most of the state, he
trails badly, 22-7-1, in Flaherty’s
bedrock southwest. It is enough of
a disadvantage to tilt the entire’ state
outlook to Flaherty, 48-43.

Specter, who has $500,000 at his
from the Republican
Senate campaign fund for television

ads, is undaunted.

“We started with a deficit in the

I polls, down 12 to 14 points,” he

said during a recent Harrisburg
press conference. “We’ve made
steady‘ progress.’ ’

Fighting for recognition among
the national campaigns are the con-
tests for state attorney general,
auditor general and state treasurer.

Pitt News Staff Writer
P-itt’s Medical School received
notification last week that federal
aid to the school, in the form of

— capitation grants, would be cut 42

"I

percent from last year’s funding.

The capitation grants, which are
based on the number of students
enrolled, have been reduced from
approximately $1,100 per student
last year to $640 this year.

According to ’Dr. Frances Dreww-

associate dean of student affairs,
the school had only anticipated a
reduction in aid of approximately
25 percent. .

million dollar budget, the capita-

To Treat Heart

By ROBERT SAMUEL -

Presbyterian-University Hospital
opened two new laboratories on
Thursday which are concerned with
diagnosis and treatment of heart
disease. The Nuclear Cardiology
Laboratory and the Exercise
Physiology Laboratory will aid
physicians in precisely studying a
patient’s heart, then determining
the most effective treatment.

Dr. William Follansbee is a direc-
tor of eachgof-the labs, and Dr.
Lewis Gumerman will joinhim as a
director of the Nuclear Cardiology
lab. Dr. Follansbee said the ser-

‘ vices offered by the labs “are avail-

able in other hospitals, but the joint
nature of them -(at Presby) is in-
teresting.”

The labs will be -able to
“diagnose, quantitate the abnormal
blood clot, provide an excellent
prescription, and evaluate progres-

' sion and therapy,” Dr. Follansbee

  

said. “It can evaluate cardiac
artery disease, muscle disease, and

'tion grants make up onlytabout
three percent_and are used primarily
for salaries.

Dr. Donald ‘F. Leon, dean of the
medical school, said the reduction
in grants will not immediately effect
enrollment, but will eventually
cause a hike in tuition. ,

Originally the capitation grants,
which began in 1966, were intended
to promote the expansion of
medical and dental schools.

A\national shortage of doctors,
however, has now been almost
eliminated and the Carter ad-
ministration wants the program
ended. L

In 1977 the administration called
for a gradual phasing out of the

high .blood.pressure.” I A
Dr. Gumerman added, “The car-
diology lab will be used to study the
heart in addition to looking at th
blood flow to the.heart.” '
The labs will be able to detect

heart conditions which do not nor- »

mally show up on hospital tests.

' “The treadmill test,” Dr.
Follansbee said, “can precipitate
arrythmias (irregular heart rhythms
which can ‘indicate heart disease)
not seen on resting electrocar-
diograms and can measure . the

,heart’s functional capacity during’

exercise.” He said the lab can also
measure blood pressure response to
exercise.

Both laboratories are equipped
with computer systems. The
nuclear lab includes the most
modern nuclear cameras available.

The project’s ‘total cost was

$500,000, which came from Pitt

and the hospital’s medicine depart-
ment. Other hospitals are expected
to refer patients to the labs.

program. Since then, Congress has
cut federal appropriations for such
grants from $116 million in 1979 to
$73.6 million this year.

When Congress reconvenes after
the November election, it will
decide whether or not to continue a
phase-out of the program or to end
it altogether.

The House is in favor of continu-
ing the gradual phasing out and
would reduce appropriations to
$29.3 million by 1982. '

The Senate prefers to do away
with the capitation grant and
replace it with another aid program
whih would give medical schools

$250 per student, for encouraging _

the enrollment of minority students
and preparing students for practice
in more rural areas.

Much of the reasoning for reduc-

ing the capitation grants has been
attributed to a report put out last
week by the Graduate Medical
Education National Advisory Com-
mittee.
J The report predicted that if pre-
sent enrollments continue, the
country will face asurplus of 70,000
doctors by 1990.

A reduction in freshman enroll-

ment by_ 17 percent by 1984 is advis-
ed by the committee, -as well as

. eliminating aid to medical students

studying in foreign countries, as a
means to‘ control the surplus.

Pitt medical students objected to
the reduction in grants, however,
stating that the reduction would on-
ly result in lower minority
enrollments and higher tuition,
which would allow only the affluent
to enter medical schools.

But according to Drew, it will be
the imiddIe—income student who "will
be hurt the most by reduced enroll-
ment.
minority students will have more
access to different types of aid and
scholarships. '

TMI Accident Breed

By SETH
, Pitt News Staff Writer .

At exactly 36 seconds after 4:00
a.m., March 28, 1979, the time
bomb went off. The first ins’ series
of malfunctions at General_ Public
Utilities Corporation's Three Mile

LUBOVE

V Island nuclear reactor. had set in,

making history as the most serious

‘accident in the civilian use of

nuclear power in the United States.

And suddenly, as people listened
to the radio. bulletins and television
broadcasts ﬂooding the airwaves,
this island irr the Susquehanna
River ceased to ‘coexist. in peaceful

acceptance with its_ Middletown,.

‘Pa. neighbors. Just the opposite
from" before, when the four giant
cooling towers had represented
monumental nuclear progress and
technology, they now loomed like
‘surrealistic monsters in a twisted.
horror movie. '

Middletown, Harrisburg, Her-
shey, and all the other southcentrtil
Pennsylvania towns were, -im=
mediately thrust into a near
catastrophic panic. Governor
Thomburgh’s office became flood-
ed with a tidal wave of questions:
Should we ’ evacuate?-, .Where' is
safety? Are schools cancelled?

"What's the general status?

And out of dire necessity came
the realization that an effective,
credible vehicle was needed to relay
accurate information to a public
which needed to make important
decisions in a time of ‘crisis.

This vehicle, evolving out of the
Govemor’s Action- Center (GAC),
would come to be known on April
'3, 1979, as the Governor's special
Rumor Control Center for TMI
problems, accepting the respon-

sibility of providing the public with’

the most clear,’precise, and updated

‘*\.

information ‘available.

There had been a lot of_misinfor-
mation being spread through the
news ‘media giving conflicting
reports on the ‘same situation, ac-
cording to Charles Kennedy, direc-

-tor of GAC, so the original 9’ a.m.

to 6 p.m. phone operation was ex-

panded, to a 24-hour hotline, and
the GAC intake capacity was in-
creased from six phones to 25
phones on "April 3, 1979. v
“The reason the 24 hour hotline
was set up was to make sure there
was one authoritative. source. . .
giving a mound ‘of information,”
Kennedy said in an interview before
a moot courtsession at the Univer-
sity or Pittsburgh ‘Law School.
“The main thing was to make sure
we were able to get the most reliable
riformation to the public,” he add-
Inasense, the role of GAC didn’t

sway greatly from" its traditional
role as a governmental ombudsman
during the Three Mile Island crisis.
It was originally set up in 1973 by
the Shapp administration, as a crisis
hotline center ‘during _ Hurricane
Agnes. I

Since then, it has evolved into an
information bank and action line,
handling citizens’ complaints of the
state government, with more than
60,000 calls yearly.

Kennedy emphasized that the ac-
tion‘ center‘ is an advocate for the
citizen, and not the government,
with -their main policy of “seeking
out the truth.”

“The GAC has a reputation for
being independent. . .somewhat
anti-government,“ Kennedy said.

But when the’ potential for

catastrophe increased on March 30
at Three Mile Island with the large
uncontrolled burst of radioactive

s Pa. RumorContro| Center

gas into the atmosphere, GAC was
forceto forego the action line -aspect

or the center, and concentrate on

obtaining accurate 'int‘oi'.-mation from
the most knowledgeable and reliable

sources. _

“Whenever anybody would
phone us, we gave the answers as we
knew them. We would never
editorialize, I relied’ on the Gover-
nor’s decision in this situation,"
Kennedy said.

An ad hoc committee was then
mobilized to examine the mgny dif-

ferent_ questions citizens were ask- I . ‘

ing, and to compile an information
‘packet to be distributed to all the
desks in the phone bank.
This wason a Thursdav. ‘Evacua-
tion centers were being established

Pitt Grad Student From Taiwan Struggles “With American Language, Food

By JANE HOLAHAN
' Pitt News Staff Writer
Getting a graduate degree in
business is hard enough, but im-

' the professor because he's speaking

English and your native language is
Chinese.

That’s the problem facing C.C.
Chang, who has been in the U.S.,
here at Pitt, for less than two mon-
ths. C.C. came here from T’aipei,
the largest city, and the capital ‘of

' Taiwan. She got her undergraduate

hung up the phone.

_ American money is confusing
because all the bills are the same
color and look pretty much alike. In

I Taiwan the money is all different

colors and sizes, she added.

Going to a restaurant could also
be a problem too.

“I used to just point to what I
wanted, but now I try to speak,”
said C.C. “I go to every restaurant
Ivcan ﬁnd. I want to get used to it.”

American food of course does

take, soine getting used to, but
Chang seems to like it.

— “I- enjoy American food. I can
get used to it. But many of my
Chinese friends cookat home,” she
said. .

All the instant and diet foods that
America seems to live on were new‘
to her.

“It tastes so strange,” she said.

Chang has found that she loves
cheese, something they don’t have
muchof in Taiwan, so now she’s
always ordering cheeseburgers. But

she still misses Chinese food, along
with all of the Chinese festivals

celebrated _in Taiwan.» _ .

“I didn’t trust what the people

the following Thursday.

PORTLANE, 0RE.—Jessie
Johnston Fretz didn’t receive the
diploma she earned at Trinity Col-

. lege in Washington, D.C., but the

college plans to set the record
straight Monday on her l00’th bir-
thday.

Dr. Rose Ann Fleming, the col-
lege’s, president, will present a

\_degree to her at the school. Mrs.

Fretz was unable to pick up her
degree with other members of Trini-
ty:s first graduating class in 1904,
because she was summoned home

shortly after her _mother’s death.

“I missed that darned degree not
because I came home to take care of
my father and my brothers after my
mother died, but because they .

. wanted me home to enertain, ”' the

Milwaukee native said.

lMrs. Fretz said she’s pleased to

. ' be getting a degree, even if it’s 76
years late.

‘ “l’ll have to admit I’m glad to be
a_ graduate,” she said.

  

  

Lost Her License,

NowSheCan’tWed,

’ OLMSTEAD FALLS,
OHIO—Her marriage license may
have been missing and her “Just
Married” signs mispelled, but
Peggy Perrien Marce finally was
wed. And forgiven.

“l’ve been really absent-minded
lately, doing all sorts of dumb
things,” the 21-year old secretary
said following her ceremony Friday
in this Cleveland suburb. '

’ Theday before her wedding, the .
,bride-to-be dropped her office’s

outgoing mail into a post box on
her way home from work. Included
in the stack of letters was her mar-
riage license, which had rested on
the car seat.

Mrs. Marce didn’t discover her
error until the wedding rehearsal.
By that time, the license- inside a
blank envolope- was en route to the
dead-letter department in Cincin-
nati.

A duplicate "license finally was
obtained through. the Marriage
License Bureau, And the ceremony
went off without another hitch.

Associated Press

SAN FRANCISCO —-—A war
against a billion-dollar marijuana
industry has turned parts" of
California’s lush farmland into a
Vietnam—like battle field, where tac-
tics include commando raids,

I walkie-talkie alerts and even punji

sticks. / ’

The state Bureau of Narcotics
Enforcement has pumped 10 per-
cent of its annual budget, about
$600,000, into ‘Operation
Sinsemilla, directed at a type of
said by users and
authorities alike to be the most po-
tent in‘ the world.

The effort was begun last year
against clandestine growers of a
seedless, female variety of pot
known locally as “Humboldt

Gold,” “Tehachapi Terror,” and

“Big Sur Holy Weed” in four nor-
thern counties. But the war has
escalated to an air-ground offensive
by local, state,‘ and federal
authorities covering 27 counties.
Steve Helsley, narcotics bureau

chief, said he believes authorities‘

are winning the war, noting that
many growers in Mendocino and
‘Humboldt counties have gone out
of business or moved.
S “Along the North Coast, we
think we’ve nipped it in the bud,”
he‘ said.
But pro-marijuana forces say the

. crackdown has had little effect.

“This. is going to be the biggest

harvest in California history,“ said’

Gordon Brownell, acting. director
for the National Organization for
the Reform of Marijuana Laws.
“There are many more people
growing much more dope in so

.many new and different places, it

could be double last year’s crop,”
he said. Brownell estimated that
about 5 percent of the crop will be
seized. I

Operation Sinsemilla got its start
with a $144,000 federal grant. Then

the Bureau of Narcotics Enforce-4
- ment won‘ assistance from the

federal Drug Enforcement Ad-

ministration, which has supplied an -

 

this year. ,

The force has grown this year to
seven full-time state agents, who are
assisted by part-time agents and
local and federal authorities.

Last year, 522 raids were con-
ducted on California plantations.
By the end of the harvest season,
that figure could double for 1980.

The narcotics bureau estimates
the marijuana industry nets $1
billion a year in California.
Growers have countered with un-
conventional measures to protect
their illegal fields.

One. grower called a prominent
San Francisco newspaper columnist
and warned, “We’re all armed and
we’ll shoot anybody who comes on
our property. I got an old lady and
three kids. If the Feds start trouble,
somebody is gonna get killed.”

  Opinion
Tuning In On ween

The student operators of WPGH and Pitt’s '

administration have just completed a long, tedious
process only to begin another in pursuit of an FM
educational radio station license.

This past summer, an application fora new FM
facility was hand-delivered to the, Federal Com-
munications Commission on the final day it could be
filed. Now, the students and administrators who are
personally committed to the project must wait a max-
imum of six months for the federal bureaucratic pro-
cess to take its course. Within half a year, Pitt will
know whether or not it can begin construction of the
proposed station. '

Although the application must still be scrutinized
by the federal bureaucracy, the proposal to establish
the station’ hasalready passed through the redtape -of
the university administration. It took months of prod-
ding and politicking to , convince the Student

-Government Board and the university senior staff

that an FM facility would be well worth the capital
investment. Once the administration and student
leaders saw the advantages of building an FM sta-
tion, the project received a stamp of approval.

An overview of the proposed stati_on—the endorse-
ment of the original proposal by. SGB, the monetary
commitment by the university’ administration, and
the countless hoursspent pouring over technical and
legal information—shows that persistence pays off.
If approved by the FCC, a project that started as a
dreamwill become a reality. .- ~

The construction of__an FM educational radio sta-
tion will provide a new dimension to the university.
Not only will the university reap the benefits offered
by an “open-air” station, but the Allegheny County

commumty will also be the recipients of a fine public
service. . . .

The proposed programming format was designed
to meet the-needs of the station's potential listening
audience, determined through interviews and ran-
dom surveys with community leaders and others. The

proposed programming format will‘ include: hourly -

news broadcasts, in-depth analysis_of current events,

. advice on economic problemsand personal ﬁnance,

“speak-out” messages, .a wide variety of musical
shows, radio serials, and ‘other programs.

If approved: by the_FCC, the new stationwill also

provide a valuable experience for students interested _

in the communications ﬁeld.

We hope that the ‘FCC approves -the license ap-
plication because of the public service it will provide
to the university and Allegheny County communities.
Also, we commend the university administrators and
students who took a personal interest in the FM pro-
iect, andsupported it through thick and thin.

Correspondence, Love Letters ond Advice From

By NICK ARNETT

Dear Nick,

I have a serious problem. For
several weeks now, I’ve been going
into a place which is labeled
“Cafeteria.” It’s in the Towers.
They tell me I’m supposed‘ to eat
there, but I don’t understand— what
it is I'm supposed to eat.

They have a bunch of strange-
colored materials there which I tried

I‘ putting in my mouth, but none of

them seem to be edible. I’m getting

, very hungry. All I’ve had to eat has

been some cookies my mother sent,
water, and a tube of toothpaste I
found in the bathroom.

I Do you have any suggestions?

. - Starving in the Towers

Dear Starving,

, -l’ve looked into this problem and
discovered that over the summer,
two university departments were
inadvertently switched. They are

' blaming physics experiments for the

situation. _

This is what has apparently hap-
pened: the area labeled
“Cafeteria” is actually a govern-

. ment-funded research lab exploring

alternative forms of energy. The
material you and others have been
trying to eat .is actually being

developed as fuel for nuclear fusion -

reactors; Thatexplains why the

.H€&1t,h,‘_Ser‘Vice has so‘ many student . .. , _.

complaints of a “fire-like sensa-
tion” in their chests and abdomens

after eating in the area labeled S

“Cafeteria.”

My avice to you and ‘others in the
same situation is -to take a look
around the physics department.
They believe the actual cafeteria is
somewhere in one of their
laboratories.
substances stored in the labs. I’d
venture that even if it’s not food,

-it’s better than the stuff you’ve been

trying to-swallow.

Dear Nick,

My professors hate me. All of

them are out to get me. They give '

me homework assignments, make
me answer questions in class, and
even require me to attend class.
Next they’ll be forcing me to answer
questions on tests!!

This isn't fair-. How do they ex-
pect me to do what I came here for?
I hardly have time to make it to

practice, and that’s without all this ’

nonsense from professors.
I want to be outstanding in my

field, just like the rest of you‘
— students. But my field is the foot-

ball field. What can I do?
' Jock Futballer
Dear Jock,

‘Punt. I  _‘uf; '

 

Try some of the.

Dear Nick,

No matter what I do, somebody
gets mad about it. I have to make
all these decisions, everyday, and
somebody is always angry about
each of them. I really want to
please everybody, but I can’t seem
to find fair solutions. How do peo-
ple expect me to make them happy?
I mean, I_ have what you might call

. a responsible job. There are a lot of

people depending on me. Without -

going into details, let me say that I
direct a company which is among
the biggest employers in the city.

My job is bigger than the
mayor's. Or even a senator. Maybe
bigger than the presidency. I mean,
'I’m at the top,,__you see? And like
they say, it’s lonely up here. I don’t
get a chance to find out what’s real-
ly goingon, because I always have
to maintain my position.

I don’t know why I’m writing
this. You couldn’t possibly under-
stand my position. I’m just
wondering, what would you do in
my place? There are people scream-
ing for me to resign, others claim
I’m not exerting enough pressure on
the legislature for increased
money. . .well, let’s not get into
details here. How do I make all
those people happy?

WLP.
(name and address withheld by re-
_ quest)

Dear W.P., »- Al

Dear Nick,

I’m sick and tired of all the
nonsense in this newspaper. Why
can’t you people write about the
really important things on this cam-
pus. I haven’t seen a single article
about real people.

Cut the student government crap.
Nobody cares about that. ‘You
could put pictures of the cheer.-
leaders in place of those stupid
stories. None ‘of them fairy male
cheerleaders, neither. I mean, I’m a
red—blooded American. I don’t

want to look at some turkey guy -

jumping around.

How about_ some news about the
ROTC? I mean, aren’t thev real

‘Dear Nick’

When Ronald Reagan becomes
president you’ll see something then,
I’ll bet. You think Tricky Dicky
was tough on _you newspaper peo-
ple? ’ You haven’t seen anything.
It’s time_to straighten out this place.
I think I’ll start right here with this
silly university.

So what are you gonna do about

it?

Dear Jay,

Eat in the place in the Towers

Continued from page 1 .

The kicking game of Florida
State was one of the team’s strong
points as the ‘Seminoles kept Pitt

,pinned deep in its own territory for

much of the game, while FSU had
excellent field position throughout
the contest.‘

The Panthers started out the
game in usual style as Florida State
received the opening kickoff.
Seminole Ricky Williams received
the ball at the six, fumbled, and
returned the ball to the FSU 12-yard
line.

On the first play, Hugh Green got
to State quarterback Rick Stockstill
and sacked him for a 10-yard loss.
Three plays later, with a fourth-
and-17, Seminole punter Rohn
Stark kicked the ball out to the 44
as Pi?t,took over on its first posses-
sion of the game.

On first-and-10 from the 44,
quarterback Dan Marino handed
off to halfback Rooster Jones who
took the ball for a gain of five
yards.

On second-and-five, Marino
went back to pass, looking for
Dwight Collins, Marino was hit.
just as he let go of the ~ball.and Col-
lins had to come back for the ball,
making a leaping catch in the end
zone’ for a Pitt touchdown. Trout
added theextra point and Pitt was
up. 7-0. ’ i

The rest of the first quarter went
pretty much the same until, on a
first-and-10 from his own 13,
Marino passed complete to Benjie
Pryor who caught the ball at the 22

o and fumbled it. FSU recovered the

ball and took it down to the Pitt
four. Not able to take the ball into
the end zone, Bill Capece came into

— the game to kick his first of five
field goals, a 24-yarder. The first
quarter ended with Pitt leading 7-3.
The second quarter started with
Pitt having possession of the ball,

On a second-and-seven from the "

Florida State 22, the Panthers were
threatening to score. Randy

Florida State’s Sam Platt (no. 29)§ave t
impressive 36-22 victory

McMillan‘. and Marino never con-
nected on the handoff and the ball
was fumbled and, recovered by
FSU’s Arthur Scott. However, the
Seminoles couldn’t move the ball
and Stark came in to punt on fourth

* down.

Troy Hill took the ball at the Pitt
24 and fumbled it right back to
FSU. Thus the Seminoles gained 45

yards on the exchange. On third-

 Seminoles Scalp Panthers,

and-nine from the Pitt 23, Stockstill
looked and passed to Hardis

"Johnson ‘for the Seminoles’ first
touchdown and lead of the game.
They never looked back.

The Panthers couldn’t move with
the ball and Hepler kicked to the
Pitt 45._ This is where Seminole
Sam Platt took over, busting
through the Pitt line for gains of
five, seven, and 30 yards. With the

Pitt’s flanker Dwight. Collins had a spectacular day against FSU as he had

sixreceptions for 183 yards andtwo touchdowns.

ball at‘ the‘ Pitt one, Stockstill
fumbled but recovered the ball back
at the five. Two plays later, with a
third-and-goal from the four, -the
Seminole quarterback passed to
tight end Sam Childers for Florida
State’s second touchdown in five
minutes. The extra point was good
and suddenly, Pitt was behind 17-7.
Again, Pitt couldn’t ,move the
ball and after another Helper punt,
Florida State took the ball and,
mixing up the plays, the Seminoles
drove toward the goal line once
again. With a fourth-and-11 from
the Pitt 26,‘_Capece came— in once
again ‘ and booted a 43-yard field
goal to give FSU a 20-7 lead.
Capece added another three-
pointer with three seconds to go in
the half to end the first-half scor-

ing. The field goal was set upiafter '

Keith Jones intercepted a Dan
Marino pass at the -FSU 25 and
returned it 41 yards to the Pitt 34.

“The kicking game was probably
our strength,”* said Florida State
“The of-
fense, the defense and the kicking
game ‘all’ together.
believe Stark’s punting tonight.‘ He
must have set some kind of national
record.”

The second half started pretty
much as the first half with Pitt mov-
ing down the field" quickly for a
score: The Panthers started first
and ‘I0, from their own ' 20.
McMillan took the ball for 11 yards
and had 15 added onto that because
of a personal foul.

Two plays later, Marino threw a
quick pass over the middle to C01-
lins which was complete for '17
yards and a first down. After a no-
gainer, Pitt had a second-and-10 at
the FSU 36. Marino threw long to
Collins who came back for another
touchdown catch. Marino threw
complete to Pryor for a two-point_
conversion and the Panthers were
back in the game. 7  "

' Florida State took the ball at
theirown 18 and mounted one of
the most impressive drives of the
game. Once again, quarterback
Stockstill mixed up the running an_d
passing plays welLand moved the
Seminoles down to the Panther
13-yard line. ' Stalled on fourth
down, Capecmcame in again and
kicked a 30-yarder to’ give the
Seminoles some breathing room at
26-15. In the next FSU series,
Capece kicked another
pointer to give the Seminoles _a
29-15 lead. ' '

Marino took charge for the
fourth and final time of the game in -
Pitt’s next series, moving the Pan-
thers from their own 20 in for a
score. The series was filled with’
passes to Pryor and runs by
McMillan. Pitt was also aided by a
pass’ interference call which moved
the ball to the FSU two. Joe Mc-
Call bulled into the end zone two
plays later and Trout kicked the ex-
tra point. Pitt was again within one
touchdown of the Seminoles.

The fourth quarter brought with
it little for Pitt fans to cheer. On
their opening dr-ive of the final stan-

za, the Panthers once again fumbl- '

ed a Marino pitchout and Florida
State recovered the ball on the Pitt
28. It took the Seminoles just five
plays to score and, with 10:24 to go,
Pitt was down by the final score of
36-221

“Our game plan was to see what
type of defense they were in and to
check off of it,” said Bowden. “We
musthave checked off at least 60
‘percent of the time. These two
back-to-back wins have got to rate
up there with anything we’ve ever‘
done.” ~ . ‘P

-The ensuing weeks showed no change. Although .
the offense improved with each game, the running
-game was thrown under covers and Dan Marinomwas
filling the airways with footballs. Pitt’s fate seemed
destined to occur with the pass.

Relying upon an attackprimarily based upon pass-
ing went against all the percentages in the last decade
of college football. The teams that won the highest.
percentage of their games were the teams with the
punishing and explosive ground attack. That’s why
the Oklahomas’, the Alabamas’, the Texas’ and the
.Michigans’ were so incredibly successful.
perts said that a team can’t win with only a passing

Entering the 1980 season, the Panthers were highly
regarded by many, if not all, scouting reports. There
were even a few who pick Pitt win it all. The prevail-
ing thought was that with the dominating offensive
line and the bruising fullback -Randy McMillan,
Pitt’s rushing game would be more than adequate to
carry the team to victory after victory. The rest of
the offense would be provided with the spectacular

' ’ Today class, the lesson will be how to lose a foot-
ball game. The first thing to remember is that a team
who lives by the pass will eventually die by the pass.
The example is the Pitt Panthers.

‘Way back before the season opener against Boston
College coach Jackie Sherrill stated something to the
effect that a team who throws the ball 40 times a

__ game cannot win the national- title. So, what hap-

" pens? Pitt played very sloppy, turning the ball over

nine times, and throwing the ball 44,times in a’14-6

Willie Collier and Benjie Pryor, later to be included
was freshman Dwight Collins.
against Florida State, the outstanding passing attack

is not enough to sustain the team.

The ex-

 

The first, and most obvious factor in the Panthers
loss is the seven turnovers committed by Sherrill’s
‘team. You can’t play a national power and turn the
ball over that many times and expect to win. It just
doesn’t happen. Oklahoma turned the ball over eight
times to Texas on Saturday and look what happened
to them. Texas won 20-13 (it could have been a
Texas romp except the Longhorns committed six tur-
novers of their own). I
Besides those ‘turnovers, however, the game still
could have been saved with a running game.
Marino had his usual impressive stats, 18 comple-
tions in 34 attempts for 286 yards and two touch-
downs. Pitt had a total of 300 yards in the air com-
pared to 127 yards for Florida State. But the'dif-
ference was Florida States’ 163 yards rushing as com-
pared to Pitt’s 86. As a result, the Seminoles were
able to run off 19 more offensive plays, 76-57,,than‘
the Panthers and thus control the game. ,
Although the first downs were fairly even, 16-15 in
favor of State, the Seminoles got nine first downs
rushing and the Panthers only got three, again show-’ ‘
ing-how Florida State controlled the game.

But, as was proved

Dan

out of sight.

Class dismissed.

 

To further emphasize the rushing stats, Pitt
rushers combined for a mere 22 rushing attempts
while Florida States’ leading runner, Sam Platt, had

, 26 rushing attempts by himself.

Early in the third quarter, with the score 23-7 in
favor of the Seminoles, Pitt scored an early
touchdown and two-point conversion to cut the
deficit to eight points. Wth almost an entire half to
play and trailing by eight points, that is no time to
panic and throw the ball all over the place. But that
is what happened because there was ‘no running

Despite the adversity, the sign of a championship
team is the one who can score the all important
touchdown when it counts the most. Pitt wasn’t able
to do that. With the score 29-22 Pitt had the ball
midway through the last quarter. Plenty of time to
sustain a drive and tie or take the lead. What hap-
pens? Fumble and the game was lost. To compete

: with the big-boys, one has to play like a big-boy.
_ Although the Longhorns committed six turnovers
against the Sooners Saturday, when trailing 13-10
with about eight minutes to play in the game, Texas
quarterback Donnie Little shook off the effects of .a
‘miserable second half to drive his team 76 yards in
under two minutes to win the game. The ability to
perform in the clutch is why the Longhorns will stay
in the top five and the Panthers will most likely drop

It’s a real shame the national championship hopes
had to end so abruptly in the warm, Florida night.
But when you try to defy the odds week in and week
out, you_will get burned eventually.

Don 'fGive Up 
National Title Yet

The Panthers’ loss at the hands of Florida State does not,
as some people may believe, end all hopes of a national cham-
pionship. It certainly does, however, diminish their chances.
One only has to look at the evidence.

Pitt gets beat by Florida State. They both have one loss.
Floridat.State’s only setback came at the hands of Miami of
Florida who itself lost for the first time Saturday against
Notre Dame. Many other teams who were expected to

. challenge for the title have already lost (Ohio -State,
Oklahoma, Nebraska, Houston, Stanford, Arkansas).
V Alabama, which holds the top spot in the polls, seem ready
for an upset. Even with their soft schedule, the Crimson Tide
- have not looked like a champion and on Saturday they barely
got by Rugers -17-13. Rutgers, although on the way up, is not
a contender, and should not have given Bear’s‘bunch such a
game. Alabama goes to Tennessee next week and the Tide
seem ready for a Volunteer ambush. A .
All this means one thingf there’s too much balance in col-

lege football today for one team to be counted out after only

one loss. Just as these other teams mentioned above have all
lost and yet they~.are still in contention. Nebraska and Florida
_ State are still in the top 10 even though_they have a setback
-f.— each. h .
’ The season is only five games old, so to rule out any chance
for a title seem ludicrous, and out of context. The Panthers A
have worked too hard and too long to stop playing after five
games. Much of their chances depend on how the pollsters
react to Pitt’s loss. *

It’s a shame that college football today is at the hands of
college pollsters who more often than not vote for the name"
colleges. It is common knowledge that the pollsters do not
have much respect for eastern teams and that could become
obvious if Pitt drops, into the teens in the ratings. Last week,
Nebrasks lost to Florida State and yet the Cornhuskers not
only didn’t drop out of the top 10, they stayed ahead of the
team that beat them. . _ p . _ .

’ The Panthers were third in the nation going into the game. ,
They will drop but shouldn’t drop out of the "top ten. If the
Panthers are to have any chance for the title, they remain
among. that elite group. If indeed they do get ranked in the
low portion of thetop 10 (eight, nine or 10) then they.are still
very much alive. - - _

With Penn State and.Tennessee still to come, the Panthers .
can still make their-own fate in the polls. If they do go
undefeated from here on in, there is nowhere to go but up.
The teams ahead of them will everitually get knocked" off as it
seems to be the pattern this year. ’

Every great team has its letdown and the season is too long b
to cry over one game. -

_ Despite an overwhelming belief that the Florida
State win last week over Nebraska was a fluke, many
5 people are nowgtaking another look at the Seminoles
and realize that State IS for real. ‘
‘ Now that the Seminoles have defeated two number
three ranked teams in a row, perhaps people will
wake up and admit that State is a good team deserv-

The‘ Super Bowl champion Pitts-

The Cinicinnati Bengals—just like

Lucy—-had done it again.

An exciting new program for Pitt students!

Though the Panthers did win the statistical game,
they also won in another column which proved to be
a major factor in the Pitt downfall-—turnovers. The
Panthers had seven turnovers in the game, four lost ‘
FSU had no turn-

The Florida State offense was amazing as the
Seminoles picked apart the highly regarded. Pitt

_ game in which _ they played catch-up almost
throughout, FSU would come back with a 20- or

llwight Collins had an outstanding evening, cat-
ching six passes for 183 yards and two touchdowns,
including Pitt’s first, hauling in a 39-yarder from

anew

By Jeff Durosko

Florida State was able to run up 163 net yards
rushing. FSU had 290 total yards for the game which
is over 100 yards more thanithe average for the four
previous opponents of Pitt.

The Panthers’ stats are not all that shabby either,
except for the turnover figure.
Seminoles’ 36. points came after a Pitt turnover; Pitt‘
passers totaled” 300 yards and Dan Marino went 18
for 34 for 286 yards and two touchdowns.
Marino was on, he was on. This was shown in Pitt’s
three touchdown drives. The Panther quarterback
showed great poise and consistency on each of those
drives in leading the team down the field in a hurry.

“‘If anybody would ask me what
my biggest win as a coach‘ was, this
would have to be it,” Bengal Coach

‘Forrest Gregg said shortly after»

Pittsburgh’s Matt Bahr missed a
39-yard field goal try with four
seconds left.

‘Bahr also missed a 51-yard field
goal try at the close of the Steeler

gloss in Cincinnati. A 28-yard
touchdown pass from Ken Ander-

the Bengals a 17-0 halftime lead,
and then they held off Pittsburgh’s
comeback.

“To beat these people twice and
to beat them" here is something,”
bubbled Gregg.

“I was thinking all week that we
were going to win because it was
something we had to do,” J ohnsoﬁ
said after his touchdown helped the
Bengals raise their record to 234.,

So, what happened?

First of all, the turnovers. As Jackie Sherrill said

following the game, you can’t make as many
mistakesas Pitt made and still win the game”.
, Secondly, Florida State is a good team. It shows
up in the stats and on the field. When the Seminoles
were down, it seemed they hadfa good play in the bag
and used it successfully. ' ,

Thirdly, the difference in the_two teams’ kicking
games was one of the most outstanding factors.
While Pitt’s Dave Trout never got a chance to try a
field goal, FSU’s Bill Capece hit on five of six at-
tempts from 24, 43, 50, 30 and 44 yards out. i

The punting of Seminole Rohn Stark was amazing.
He punted seven times for an average of 48.1 yards
One of his kicks went 67 yards.
Dave Hepler punted five times for an- average of 37
yards per puntf The numbers speak for themselves.

Finally, perhaps the Panthers were listening to a
‘lot_of the talk going around about Florida State. The
Seminoles are a good team and their wins over
Nebraska and Pitt were no fluke. Pitt may have just
taken FSU.too lightly and if so, it turned out to be a

“It was another one of those

quarterback Terry ‘Bradshaw, who

third ‘quarter that included a block-

McCartt said that although she
could not see, she knew she was
hoisted out a window because

i"“there‘was a lot of wind on me. . .I

was out the window at the
time. . .There was a change ‘in
temperature, and there were a lot of

Defense attornevs claimed there
was no evidence McCartt had been
hoisted out a window. Two other
dormitory students testified that
McCartt was dangled over a bed

- and not outside the window.

torney Lou Coles said university
police found marks on the outside
of the window.
McCartt said that when she was

water was ice cold and I was stuck
under the stream.” The bag (that
was over her head “started filling

The cover is an experimental art
photograph by Tim Bigler, Photo
Editor of The Pitt News,
SHOWCASE would like to express
their thanks to Mr. Bigler for the use
of his work entitled "Touch By Feel-
ing." Besides working for The Pitt
News, Bigler is currently a senior ina-
ioring in Chemistry at the University
of Pittsburgh. He feels the
photograph is symbolic of "a
humanistic desperation thatexists in
a pseudo-totalitarian—socioeconomic
milieu," or, as he also put it, "just a

I lot of fun in the dark room." What

this type of thinking means is really
not very clear to us, but it makes for
nice art. SHOWCASE would also
like to thank M.P. for those lips.

A - World-Famous Polish ’Mutes’
g  Stop in, Pittsburgh

' By I.D. KLEINKE

Theater for the shy type? Maybe;
but probably not. Mime has always
been one of those arts, seemingly
relegated to the breed of person too
often considered overly expressive.
In general, those endowed with an
almost divine level of metaphysical
insight. People often-referred to as
"space cadets."

But an intemationally-acclaimed
Mime troupe will stop in the Steel
City for one performance, hopefully
dispelling these myths.

Mime, and more specifically, the
Warsaw Mime Theatre, is a
necessary agent of the theatrical in-
terphase. Finding part of its
ancestory in physical theater,
another‘ part in modern dance, and
still another part somewhere inascer-
tainable, Mime is, like any perforrn-
ing art, an interpretation of being.

Famous for its bashful fleeting

from the spoken word, Mime draws ‘

upon its limited resources bringing
the human body in its purest form to
the thematic stage. i

The Warsaw Mime Theatre's ap-
pearance in Pittsburgh will mark yet
another recognition by the city of the
other, more esoteric arts.

The Warsaw Mime Theatre
. . .remarkable innovations in the art

A long-awaited special event spon-

sored by the ‘University of

Pittsburgh's Floating Theatre, the
Troupe will perform at the Central
Catholic High School Auditorium on
Fifth Avenue in Oakland. -

The Mime Theatre has been well-
received and highly reputed for its
remarkable innovations in the a_rt; it
is traditional Mime, highlighted with
a perfect blend of dance and original
music, and tempered with a high
level of technical skill.

‘Historically, Warsaw Mime is an
outgrowth of the Renaissance
characterizing Polish theater in the
past several‘ decades. Training under
mime teacher-director Henryk
Tomaszewski, the troupe slowly
"found itself" through a uniquely ex-
pressive sytle of theater that it
developed over" the years. In 1975,
the Mime Theatre integrated
classically-trained dancers with its
ranks, further promoting an un-
duplicatable and progressive style.
The troupe’s repertory is futher in-
dividualized and enhancedlin by its
scores, composed solely for its own
work. g ,

The one performance in Pittsburgh
of the Warsaw Mime Theatre will be
on Sunday, October 26, at 8 p.m.

The Pittsburgh Laboratory Theatre
will open its long-awaited perfor-
mance of the scatalogical tragedy,
Swellfoot's Tears on October 23, at
the Lion Walk- Performing Arts
Center on North Craig Street. Writ-
ten by Lab Theatre's resident
playwright and University of Pitts-
vburgh theatre professor Leon Katz,

NO PLACE ‘To BE SOMEBODY

P Directed by.Raymond Laine

Written by Charles Gordone
Point Park College Theatre Company
Playhouse Theater Downstairs

By ].D. KLEINKE

When considering a play as heavily in-
volved with social and cultural connota-
tions as Charles Gordone’s No Place to Be
Somebody, it is necessary to discern where
a discussion of the actual play should’ epd,
and an examination of the specific perfor-
mance should begin.

But such a distinction is almost impossi-
ble to make with this particularwork. The
actors must be so completely involved with
the characters, and the production comes so
close to realistic accuracy that the line that
separates dramatic literature from produced
theatre is inescapably blurred.

As a dramatic work, the play is emo-
tionally devastating. There are far too
many thematic twists and implications to
even begin to scratch the surface of them in
one review.

_No Place to Be Somebody is a sardonic‘
distortion of the American dream. Alnew
Sixties approach that appraised a coming

generation of reform and civil rights. It is a

tough, and often bitter examination of the
Black American dream; the short-cutting of
society to achieve the specific end of wealth
and power. ~ ,
With an eye focused sharply on the
"already made it” local Mafia, second-rate
seedy saloonkeeper-pimp, Johnny Williams
portrayed by a . convincing William An-

thony McElroy,findsgl;imself cau ht u in a _.
violently ‘changing world- - Acting upon his

idea of the Black American dream, he pulls
a shifty deal with a young, upper-class
social crusader whose father just happens to
be a key local official. - ' ’

But something is happening to him in the
process. He finds his world melting away
around him as his all-black and decadent
society slowly latches onto the idea of
”becoming white" to better themselves. He
is stranded in the middle of a poor and
ethnic river, while waves of changing
values rush past him.

The plot twists around itself so \many
times, that only the most attentive of
theater-goers will fully comprehend its

‘magnaminously complex premise.

As for the production, the cast took an
extremely difficult script will into stride,
escaping with only minimal problems.

The Pittsburgh Dance Council is
eagerly awaiting an active season of
bringing new and varied dance pro-
grams to the Steel City.

The Council will offer two series,
both functioning to sponsor dancers
and companies from across the na-
tion, and to promote .and publicize
three local companies that are alive
and expanding. ' '

The guest series will bring artists
from New York City into Pittsburgh
for limited performances. Martine
van Hamel, a principal ballerina with‘
the American Ballet Theatre, Gary
Chryst, a principal‘ dancer with the
Joffrey Ballet, and a performer in
Broadway's Tony-award winning
Dancin', and Kevin MacKenzie, an
ABT soloist, will all appear in the
guest series’ opener, A Celebration of
Dance. The performance will be a
montage of ensembles, solos, and pas
de deux, and will open at the Pitt-
sburgh Playhouses Craft Avenue
Theatre on November 14th.

The guest series continues in
February when the Murray Louis
Dance Company of New York will
perform on the 27th and 28th at the
Playhouse. Performing works
choreographed by famed performer
Murray Louis, the company is a
pioneer in the world of American
Modern Dance.‘ Their works are
abstract and surrealistic, and are a
feast for the dance enthusiast who
delights in-indulging his imagination.

On March 2nd, the Philobolus

Their rhythm was impeccable, and in-

tures boy; boy abandons reality; boy pays.

But-somewhere between the first and se-
cond acts, the dance fell prey to the nagging
plot. By the end, the stock characters of
whimsical fairy, whimsical-er boy, and
crusty, .mischievous _ old witch, have
usurped the stage, sending the dancers scur-
rying into the wings. Working with the
broad (and often over—cute) gestures that
replace dialogue on the ballet stage, the ac-
tion became the mainstay, and soon after, a
little tedious. Hence, we have pantomime,
grossly out of context.

This situation was rather unfortunate,

V for during the ballet sequences near the con-

clusion of La Sylphides, Ballerina Francesca
Corkle, outdid her earlier performance of
La Ventana with an added display of energy
and expression. ’ ’ ‘

PBT's opening night proved spotty, but
there were enough high points that made
the evening worthwhile. The Harp Concer-
to was superlative, and the dance in La
Sylphides (during its occasional interludes)
was more than adequate in leaving the
ballet enthusiast satisfied.

By WALTER wA_TsoN

Ordinary People is a real film. It explores

, and observes the complexities of the nuclear

family when faced with an extreme
crisis,unprepared to cope or recover from
it. The opening autumn scenes take the
viewer on aquiet, unobtrusive tour of safe,

‘death. Heavily breathing, Conrad is trap-

their son in his moment of need. They try _ .

to give him time to put behind him the acci-

get past superficial relationships, in their

‘ communcation to one another, or in their

churches, the uprooting introduction of}

Conrad Jarrett (Timothy Hutton), a troubl-
ed teenager in the Chicago suburb, is
presented. In a convincingly desperate cold
sweat, Conrad awakes, struggling through
most of the film to escape recurring
nightmares that lead to his brother Buck's

affection. Since" the family seems to have
expressed so much of their love or affection
for one another through Buck, they all ap-

principals to the absolute limits of mixed
emotion and character depth.” The Jarretts
are not cartoons off a pageiof True Confes-
sions or the television studios of The Edge
of Night, but are real, devastatingly honest
human beings. They are caught in a
tension-filled world where there are no
straight, convenient answers to _dissipate
their sorrow or allow their lives to resume
as Bette Conrad (Moore) impatiently put it,

 ”back to normal.”

The unique backdrops of suburban
Chicagoland serve for credibility. The set-
tings contrast the failure and desperation of
the characters. The Redford eye does not
blow the tension and despair out of propor-
tion. Instead, Redford reaches the
threshold of dramatic intensity gradually,
carefully and intelligently, as if every scene
must succeed, or the film is lost. When
Conrad decides to begin visiting Dr. Berger
(Judd Hirsch), a psychiatrist, to get in touch

with his feelings, and express what his V

parents are incapable of grasping, the
observation of their discussions are quietly
opened to the. audience. There are no pull-

leading men and ladies with a script that
was witty, charming and romantic.
Somewhere In Time , however, is few, if

so) sense of humor _(or irony) stalks the
celluloid when the intensity of a scene ap-
pears near the breaking point.

Conrad's relationships with kids at Lake

urgent visual flashbacks of the tragic acci-
dent contribute to tremendous dramatic

impressive empathy for the Jarrett family in

transition that few films dare to" expose. ‘ '

The stark and unencumbered’ sights and
sounds of Ordinary People make this film
lasting entertainment, which will leave its
‘audiences without the comfort of a happy

ending with heroes and villians to boot. It is

open-ended, leaving the issue warm in the
minds of its viewers. The question mark.

lies rhetorically with. the audience, whom 

are left to ask themselves if any nuclear
family of today can afford to be unchang-

ing in the face of problems that bade their “  '3

attention; can they in fact remain ”ordinary
people"? -

Chicago playwright named Richard Collier
(Christopher Reeve) who is given a gold
pocket watch by a mysterious old woman
he doesn't know, but who tells him to
"come back to me.” Eight years later
(1980), Collier, still perplexed by the
woman's message, stumbles upon the pic-
ture of a beautiful young actress circa 1912
who just happens to be—you guessed

it—the old woman. Since she is dead now, _

he decides that the only way to meet her is
to travel backwards in time. With a little
difficulty, this is achieved and Collier finds
himself living in the year 1912. He meets
the actress (Jane Seymour) and they fall in
love only to be split up when he quite sud-
denly returns to the present time.

About the only thing about Somewhere
In Time is the physical attractiveness of the
leading characters. Christopher Reeve, so
good as a campy Superman, isn't given a
chance to act here, but he's appropriately
tall, dark and handsome. Jane Seymour, an
up-and-coming English actress, must be
considered the movie's visual focal" point,
however. If Bo's a 10, Seymour must be an
11 .

Somewhere In Time is a major disap-
pointment and even worse is the thought
that several movies just like it will be;releas-
ed in the next year. Let's hope that
Hollywood gets it right next time, but in the
meantime stay home and watch Cary Grant
on the late show. i

September 30, 1980 -

Everybody in the sold-out crowd ex-

most didn't expect was that the night
wouldn't last long.

The Silencers again played the Stanley in
front of a biased audience. They managed

‘ to win a few of these Heavy Metal fans but

most of the crowd seemed oblivious to
them. Their set, though short (40 minutes)
included eight tracks off their first album
and one as-of-yet unreleased tune entitled
”Romantic." Pittsburgh's Rock And Roll
enforcers gave their all for the home town
crowd. '

After a long 50 minute intermission the
"Bell" tolled literally as AC / DC stormed in-
to ”Hells Bells.” They then resorted to a
couple of older numbers, ”Shot Down in
Flames" and "Sin City,” that were dedicated
to the ’Burgh. "Back in Black" the tribute to
the late Bon Scott
vocalist) followed, and this was the best
tune of the show. Need. it be said though

thatgwith the good comes the bad, for the"

next song was the low point of the night.
"Bad Boy Boogie” isn't a bad song but the
stage antics of Angus Young (lead guitar
and visual front man) were in very bad
taste. While the rhythm section of"Malcolm

Cult, Sabbath Beat Arena

BLUE OYSTER CULT/ BLACK
BATH/SAXON
Civic Arena

October 3, 1980

Hell Bent. Heaven Sent.

On a damp, windy and full.-mooned Fri-
day night, .there's nothing quite like a kick-
Sut-the jams hard rock concert to fill you ‘
with a reckless feeling of abandonment.

And certainly, on a recent such Friday

'- night, the Black and Blue tour featuring
«Blue Oyster Cult and BlacksSabbath more

than- got the job done, in a concert filled
with adrenalin gushing between the sold
out- Civic. Arena crowd and performers,
plenty of unannounced surprises and un-
compromising hard and heavy music which
would never be mistaken for Barry‘
Manilow. _.
Besides all of the debris and the large con-

' tingent of Pittsburgh's finest (after all, this

was heavy metal)~greeting you upon ar-
rival, the first surprise of the night was the
noticeable absence of the announced open-

.ing act, Shakin’ Street, a French new wave-

act.
‘ Instead, Saxon, an English'heavy metal

" band was thrown to the crowd at the last

moment with no explanation given.
Saxon, in case you don't know, is one of
the bands currently leading the heavy metal
renaissance in England and Europe with the
likes of Def Leppard, Iron Maiden, Judas

' Priest and several‘ others: After seeing and

hearing Saxon perform,
why?

In their loud and noisy 45 minute set the
only thing Saxon did of note was when
their lead singer got the well-tuned crowd to
scream in unison the intelligent cry,"I don't
give a shitl”; everything else was boring
and cliche heavy metal.

h Thankfully, there were two other bands
the people -had paid to see.

the question is

After Saxon, came rock legends Black _ "

Crowd Black And Blue

Sabbath for' their first -Pittsburgh ap-
pearance without former lead singer Ozzy
Osbourne, who left the band last year over
musical and personality differences.

When Sabbath took the stage, new lead
singer Ronnie Dio, formerly of Rainbow
and Elf was fronting the band; but longtime
drummer Bill Ward was absent, havng quit
the band several weeks ago, with Vinnie

. Appice his unannounced replacement.

Fortunately for Sabbath, Appice\is an ex-
cellent drummer and Ward's absence was

not even noticed by most of the people in ,

the audience.

Sabbath's test was to see how the crowd ,

would. take to Dio in comparison to
Osbourne, who unquestionably was the
most instantly identified and recognized
member of Black Sabbath‘.

Dio, while not the appealing frontman
Osbourne was, is a much better singer,
even though he never once came close to

. firing the crowd up _.the way Osbourne did

with his crazed stalking of the stage and
wild flashing of the peace sign with arms up
raised over his head.

However, old hands and remaining
members, guitarist Tony lommi, one of
rock's most underrated guitarists, and
bassist Geezer Butler cranked out the

molten and hard driving slightly unnerving -
- sound which has always been the band's

trademark. . . »

With there no messing music (you don't
think about it, you just react to it) filled
with mystic, occult overtones and an im-
pending feeling of doom, Sabbath, indeed,
did well. ' - ~

"War Pigs," ”N.I.B.,” "Black Sabbath,”

"Iron Man,” ”Paranoid," "Children of the '

Grave” and "Sabbath, Bloody, Sabbath”
made up the bulk of the older material
while, "Neon Knights,” ”Heaven and Hell"
and "Children of the Sea" came off of the
new album Heaven and Hell.

Coming up last on the night was the .
V_am'azing Blue Oyster Cult, five small men

Young rode through the aisles of the

Canada's Newest

Misses The Beat

THE KINGS/ THE TREMBLERS
Stage One
Oct. 7, 1980

' By SAM MATTHEWS

"We describe ourselves as ’beat music’,"
said Kings keyboardist Sonny Keyes. "It's
still rock and roll, but you can dance to it."

The problem was. that nobody danced.
Canada's latest hot stuffs, The Kings came
blasting into Stage One last Tuesday night

\ expecting to get the near capacity crowdlon _

their feet. But they missed the target.

The Kings played before 50,000 at Heat
Wave and have opened for Jeff Beck in
Texas, so they must have something. That
something certainly isn't excitement. Their
stage moves were limited to guitarist Aryan
Zere, bassist David Diamond, and the a
forementioned Styles pogoingin unison.
Otherwise, they stand in one place on the
stage. Vocalist bassist Diamond was the
most animated of the lot.

The Kings played their album almost in

ed. Fifteen minutes later the house lights
were brought up to the cascade of boo’s and
obcenities from -the disappointed crowd.
Ten songs and 70 minutes of the headliner is
hardly worth the near—$10 ticket price.

I AC/DC could and should be better, and

play longer. -

Dance Band 

its entirety. Throughout their eleven song
set they duplicated the tonality and the tex-
ture of the record. They almost developed
their own interpretation of the Beach Boys
oldie "California Girls.” In the Also-
Performed-But-So-What column, The
Kings did their hit, "Switching To Glide,"
”Beat Goes On,” and two new songs. Even
when Diamond implored the crowd to
"PARTYU" that didn't help. These guys
make pleasant enough music, they're just
not exciting. Once again they failed to con-
nect. »

The Tremblers, featuring ex-Herman’s-
Hermits front man Peter Noone, opened the
show. Although most of the crowd ex-
pected to hear Blasts-from-the-Past from.
Noone he offered a completely new batch

. of songs. Handling vocal chores and play-

ing inaudible rhythm guitar, Noone had his
show stolen from him by lead player Joe
Conner. Conner's guitar work gave these
fine crafted pop songs theprimative edge
that they needed to be believeable. The
Tremblers encored with Elvis Costello's
"Green Shirts."

Da Boss Leaves ' Em Gasping For More

BRUCE SPRINCSTEEN '
Cleveland Coliseum ’ '
October 6, ' 1980

By FRANK DIGIACOMO

Flashlights danced on the pitch-dark
stage as vague human forms strapped on
their guitars and plugged into their amps.
Seven had come to play, but only one of
those dark figures would command the
electricity that surged through the coliseum
on this crisp October night. He and he
alone would have the crowd chanting his
name and dancing their hearts, souls, and
senses away. And when the night was over,
this man would have proved once more
that Bruce Springsteen is, and always will
be, The Boss. .

The stagelights flashed on, the crowd
screamed, and Springsteen swaggered
upstage. He and the ‘ever-so-tight E Street
Band launched into ”Prove It All Night,"
caught fire with‘ ”Badlands,” and burned
with "Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out." The en-
tire Coliseum would not, could‘ not, sit
down.

For the next three» hours and forty
minutes, Bruce Springsteen would run,
jump, dance, pose, stagger, swagger, mug,
tease, please, ham, and sing his heart and
soul out with the air of a little kid showing
off on the playground. His voice was.
studio-perfect yet raw and energy-filled.
His guitar-playing was exhilarating and
tightly'complemented by the smokey sax-

playing of Clarence Clemons, and the rest
of the E Streeters. One wonders if he's been
caught in the midst of a raunchy rock fan-
tasy.

On stage, Springsteen is the embodiment

of James Dean, Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly,
Elvis, and a little bit of God. Yet, at the
same time, he can't be compared to any or
all of them. He sings to you and he owns
your soul. He dances and you want to
dance like him. He makes it look like such
fun. ’ * ‘

A girl jumps on stage and kisses him like
a long lost boy-friend. As security Whisks
her away, Springsteen hams it up and
faints. The ''Big Man,'' Clemons revives the
Boss and he launches into an unexpected
"Fire." The band, long used to Springsteen's

. spontaneity, deftly catches up and brings

the crowd to their feet once more.
Tonight, he relies heavily on his
Darkness on the Edge of Town and Born to
Run albums while inserting numerous cuts
from his new album. New songs include the
biting yet touching, "The River,” "Cadillac
Ranch,” and a rousing ”]ackson Cage.”
"Gone are the ‘older classics such as "San—
dye (Fourth .of July in Asbury Park)/'
"Fever/’ "And Then She Kissed Me,”
"Spirits In The Night,” and the sadly missed
"Growing Up.” In fact, the only song

. Springsteen performs from his first two
albums is a frenzied version of "Rosaliia"
_ that has people jumping off their seats and

rushing the stage.

Nonetheless, the Boss and the E Street
Band execute classic versions of "Factory,"
”Thunder Road,” a haunting "Point Blank,"
"Backstreets," "Badlands," ”Promised

. Land," "Because The Night,” and two en-

cores consisting of "Thunder Road,”
"]ungleland,” and "Devil With the Blue
Dress/Medley" in which the 4 lights are
turned up and Springsteen promises to play 5
only if everyone dances—everyone does

‘with abandon.

The E Street band deserves much credit
here. Their performance is impeccable yet
not overriding. Guitarists, Miami Steve
Van Zandt and bassist, Garry W. Tallent
take over where Springsteen leaves off,
weaving in and out -‘of his axe-playing.
Drummer, Max Weinberg, keeps a strong,
heart—pounding beat with the flair of a true
professional while keyboardists Roy Bittan
and Danny Federici complement Springs-
teen’s driving songs with haunting piano

and organ melodies. Last but certainly not‘

least, is the "Big Man," Clarence Clemons,

(Continued from page 6l '
(in stature) from Long Island, New York

who play big hard driving, entertaining and

surprisingly intelligent heavy metal music.

Consisting of Eric Bloom, guitar and lead
vocals, Don (Buck Dharma) Roeser, lead:
guitar, Allen Lanier; keyboards and guitar,
bassist Al Bouchard and his brother drum-
mer Alan Bouchard, the Cult is a band
where there is no one real star, but where
every member of the group combines for
one very strong Iive'act, which seems to get
better and better upon each visit to Pitts-
burgh. ‘ '

Roeser, unquestionably one of rock's
elite on instrument, showed his prowness
on/'_D,on’t Fear the Reaper,” ”Dr. Music,”
"Divine Wind" (the ..song which tells the
Ayatollah where to go), "ME 262" and
‘"Cities’s on Flame” with beautifully ex-
ecuted riff parts and fiery soloing.

Bloom handled most of the lead vocal»
and announcing‘ chores, while Alan
Bouchard had his vocal spot on ”Cit_ies on

a legend in himself. ‘Clemons is constantly
eliciting cheers with tasty sax-playing and a
lot of clowning around with his life-long
companion, Springsteen. ‘

Suddenly, it's time to go and everyone’s

. just standing there asking for Bruce. It's like
waking from’ a fantastic dream; there's A

disappointment because it's over but most-
ly, a sense of extreme exhilaration. ' '
Get ready Pittsburgh, there's a ‘dream
coming ‘to town and his name ' is
Bruce-—Bruce Springsteen. . . ~

Cult, Sabbath Beat Black and Blue

Flame," "Joe Bouchard" on "Godzilla," and
"Hot Rails to Hell."

What's always been so appealing about
the Cult has been their sense of humor, and
success hasn't made the band serious.

Bloom drove a huge Harley onstageat
the beginning of "Born to be Wild" after a
furious 10 minute guitar rave-up which
featured all five members thrashing away at
center stage. . e .

During "Godzilla," drummer Bouchard

donned’ a monster mask while pounding a —

solo complete with fire explosions and
strobe lights as an intro to the huge green
Godzilla monster which was wheeled to the
back of the stage, it's arms moving and
breathing smoke and fire.

All this may sound like something out of
the KISS stage antic book, but the Cult“ pull
it off making you laugh at just how absurd
it is. .

And after all, this ain't no nukes, it's
Heavy metal.

David Bowie

. . .n'1'usic that cuts to the bone.

SCARY MONSTERS
David Bowie
RCA

On David Bowie's new album, the refrain
of the title track goes: ”Scary monsters,
super creeps; keep me running, running
scared." Whether’ this is a reference to
RCA’s promotional personnel screaming
for a commercial album to push is open to
the imagination. .

However, after a series of resolutely ex-
perimental albums, Bowie has started to
lighten up a bit. Actually, it was a process
that began with last year's Lodger. This

time around though, Bowie seems to be’

reaching for the _top 40 again.

Overall, Scary Monsters is comparable to
Peter Gabria_l's third album. A record that
mixes various periods of the artist's career

‘while using sonic experiments as the

dofninatingg theme. V I  .

 

For example. "Ashes To Ashes" and
”Fashion” remind one of Bowie's "plastic
soul" period. This was the time he was tur-
ning out singles like "Fame" and "Golden

Years"- Only now, various electronic
creatures swarm and breed in the
background.

On the other hand, Bowie continues with
the unadulterated agression of the last few
records. Scary Monsters could easily have

. fitted into last year's Lodger. Bowie even

goes back a little further into his past
because "lt’s No Game (pt. 1)” sounds like
the opening segment of Diamond Dogs.
Actually, for all Bowie's experiments of,

the past, some things remain the same. All
along, ‘he's been interested in surfaces and
the unpleasant things that lay beneath.
Add music that cuts to the bone, and you
have a ‘really worthwhile record.

Goes for the throat. ,

TAKING LIBERTIES
Elvis Costello
Columbia

There's one thing you can say about Elvis
Costello even if you don't like his music. He
is sure as hell prolific. In only three years
he has managed to produce five different
albums.

His newest release, Taking Liberties,
wraps up the loose ends of his‘career. It's a
vcollection of outakes, B-sides of singles
“unreleased in the U.S. and other musical
floatsam and jetsam.‘

The most interesting thing about this
album“ is that it lets you" trace Costello's
development as a personality and artist.

' The songs bounce between several\ dif-
ferent styles. There's’ country material like
the balled ”Stranger In The House] and the
swing-dance number ”Radio Sweetheart."

Elvis Costello and The Attractions ~ .

There's observant, seabarous rockers like "I
Don't Want To Go To Chelsea,” and there
are some surprisingly light pop numbers
like "Doctor Luther's Assistant.”

One thing about this album is the
‘predominance of ballads.

Among other things, there are slow ver-
sions of "Clowntime Is Over” and ”Black
And White World"; songs that appeared on
Get Happy!!! . There's also one of the least
likely longs you'd expect Costello to do;
Rogers &: Hart's ”My Funny Valentine.”

Though some people are stll longing for
another ’This Year's Model’, which" is still
Costello's best effort, you ‘really can't
knock his consistancy‘ as a song writer.’

I-lopefully, he won't take liberties with this

talent.
