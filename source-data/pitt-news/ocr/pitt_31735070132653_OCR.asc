yesterday afternoon, Bart Simpson was
walking around Hillman Library, and
no one recognized him.

Yes, that is the truth.

Nancy Cartwright, who serves as
the voice of Bart Simpson, is used to
not being recognized — and she likes
the anonymity. . «

“It’s cool, because I get all the
perks, but I don’t get the invasion,”
Cartwright said. i

That is, of course,
unless she approaches
someone with her favorite
line, “I’m -Bart Simpson,
who the hell are you?”

The Emmy award-
winning Cartwright gave

The entire Big Idea bookstore might
have less ﬂoor space than Borders devotes
to its latte lounge area.

But the size of the bookstore doesn’t
diminish the appeal to the people who work
there.

“[Working at the Big Idea is] really
rewarding, in a way that other volunteer
experiences have been draining,” volunteer
Emma Rehm said.

Originating three years ago as a table
where books and music were sold at the
VV1lkinsburg art and music venue, Mr.
Roboto Project, the Big Idea is, according to
its Web site, dedicated to promoting the dis-
tribution of radical and alternative literature.

Now in Bloomﬁeld, near the intersec-
tion of Liberty Avenue and Millvale Street,
and a few steps from a 54C bus stop, the
diminutive store is easy to overlook. Were it
not for the glass storefront, the Big Idea
could easily be mistaken for one of the
small residential buildings in the area. A
small sign, written in marker and taped to
the front door, armounces the Big Idea’s
existence.

While browsing the radical and pro-
gressive media housed in the 20—by-20-foot
ground ﬂoor space -— the upstairs level is
even smaller — customers can overhear the

staff banter about politics and philosophy.
The sounds of hip-hop artist Talib Kweli
and indie-rock group Death Cab for Cutie
come from a CD player and ﬁll the small
store. ‘

Book categories range from anarchism
to globalization to- vegan and vegetarian
cookbooks. Several of the well-known writ-
ers in the leftist literary canon have their
own sections: foreign policy critic Noam
Chomsky, feminist bell hooks -— she spells
her name with no capital letters — and his-
torian Howard Zinn.

A small section of movies — such as a
drama set in the middle of the Spanish civﬂ
War -—- CDs and record albums share a cor-
ner with books such as “Polysexuality,”
which features essays on various aspects of
political and social inﬂuences on sex. _.

“Zines” — a term used to encompass
all manners of publications produced by
individuals or small, independent organiza-
tions — are similar to magazines, but they
come in a multitude of unorthodox fonnats.
Many of the zines for sale are produced
locally, quite possibly in basements. They
discuss. topics like the second Palestinian
Intifada, copyright laws and booking your
own concert. ’

Readers are invited to recline on the
sofa cushion propped against the railing
while perusing titles like the Anar€ho-pﬁm-
itivist Journal, or to sit at the table, which is

 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
     
   
    
   
  
  
     
   
   
      
     
  
  
  
  

sloppily painted in bright, primary colors,
with booklets that defy categorization.

Slim volumes are bound with yarn and
dangle the aluminum stubs that pop open
soda ‘cans. A person can ﬂip through the
pages, which are composed of small pieces
of what was once a poster, to mentally piece
together messages like “Their Weapons
Won’t Save You.” '

~ “Heartstrings Yarns About Polyarnory” ‘

and “hip Moma — The Parenting Zine” sit
on the shelves, near locally published comic
books.

VV1th space at a premium, shelves built
into a wall are utilized to hold cups, avail-
able for purchase, bearing the Big Idea logo.

Everywhere, posters and ﬂiers
armounce upcoming events and concerts. A
series of posters with various abstract
images related to war and peace, with the
unifying slogan “make art not war,” hang
on the front wall. V

Next to the cash register sit quarter
sheets, alerting people about the April 25th
march in Washington, D.C., for “freedom
of choice.”

Those who want to take a break from
reading can help themselves to free fair-
trade coffee at the sink in the back.

A dozen or so people, who volunteer
throughout the week, run the store com-
pletely on their own, It might sound unreal-
istic to expect a staff to operate a store with-

out pay, but the Big Idea seems to be doing
it, anyway.

Such valuable information is “so difﬁ—
cult to come by,” and the store is °a “place to
share ideas,” volunteer Corinne Ogrodnik
said.

“I get to surround myself with all this
valuable information,” she added.

' Riccardo Robinson, a recent addition

to the volunteer staif, agreed, calling the A

store “the school outside of school,”
because it provides “access to alternative
information.”

As if to further separate the store from
conventional businesses, Rehm, sporting a
pink t-shirt with a large, clenched ﬁst,
emphasized that the Big Idea does not
attempt to compete with other stores. As a
nonproﬁt organization, all the money goes
into ordering more books and paying the
rent.

“There’s no reason [for us] to compete
with a local business,” she said, noting that
the staff of the Big Idea goes out of the way
to ensure that they don’t draw customers
away from places like the music shop,B1"ave

New World, in Oakland.

A The enthusiasm of the volunteers — a
growing population, as a number of new

recruits are being trained — bodes well for

the future of the small collective.
“Every time I come here, I getexcited
and inspired by the people,” Ogrodnik said.

Mizzou sorority hazes for blood drive

There’s a lot of bad blood going
around at the University of Missouri-
Columbia.

Gamma Phi Beta, a sorority there,
apparently sent an e-mail to its members
concerning an upcoming, competitive
blood drive, urging its members to lie
about their health in order to win.

“I dont [sic] care if you got a tattoo
last week LIE. I don’t care if you have a
cold. Suck it up. We all do. LIE. Recent
peircings? LIE. Even if youre going to
use the Do Not Use My Blood sticker,
GIVE ANYWA ,” wrote Christie Key,
the chapter’s blood donation coordinator,
according to an Associated Press report.

Perhaps even more disturbingly, Key
also wrote that, “Punishment for not giv-
ing blood is going to be quite severe.” So
unless the Gamma Phi Beta members bel-
lied up.to the blood bar, they would be
penalized —— perhaps harshly enough to
draw blood.

» At Pitt, we know a little something

about hazily deﬁned hazing policies. Jack
Daniel, we’re looking in your general
direction. But this is a clear-cut example
of hazing.

Mizzou’s anti-hazing law clearly
states that, “Hazing is ... any action or sit-
uation created, whether on or off universi-
ty premises, which might reasonably be
expected to result in mental or physical
discomfort, embarrassment, harassment
or ridicule.”

Key created a situation that was
expected to result in discomfort for peo-
ple who didn’t comply. Her e-mail should
be example No. 1 of what not to do in the
“How to not haze” handbook. And her
threats went beyond the usual hazing fare.
Instead of public humiliation or the vol-
untary construction of beer pong tables,
Key’s comments border on abusive coer-
cion. A

Obviously, Mizzou is going to inves-
tigate. More than that, though, Gamma
Phi Beta needs to clean house. Key

should be booted from the sorority, and -

whoever leaked the e-mail to the local
press —— if she is a member of the sorori-
ty — should be rewarded.

Moreover, Gamma Phi Beta should
make reparations to the American Red
Cross, which ran the drive. The Red Cross
discourages people who have recent
piercings or tattoos, or have been sick,
from donating. Now all the blood collect-
ed there should be under suspicion.

What Key did was against the goal of
the drive. Instead of helping sick people,
she created a situation that will take time,
and sensitivity from the sorority.

For now, Gamma Phi Beta should
take out ads of apology in the Mizzou
independent student newspaper, The
Maneater, which recently ran a vanity
story on how the Greek blood ‘drive
exceeded its goal. Nothing says, “We’re
sorry” like increased ad revenue.

Pitt, take some good advice — it’s free

There’s one thing that, over my
years in Pittsburgh and my last year as
the editor of the independent student
paper here, I’ve always found to be
free — even at Pitt.

Advice.

I’d like to take this opportunity to
thank all of the Pitt administrators, fac-
ulty, students, cleaning
staff, food service workers
and community members
who have given me all the
advice I could ever want
and more this year, all with-
out ever charging me an
extra 14 percent (rimshot).

Now, I’d like to return
the favor. Pitt, here are

 

fair if some groups had to meet quotas
to get funding and others didn’t. We
know this is tough, and We’re willing
to be ﬂexible, but we still have to'be
fair. _

Now, do I believe that?

Hell, no. '

But it’s a better answer, at least,
‘ and one that I, and the rest
of the campus, could
respect.’

2. You do get points
for effort. “

I know sometimes_ the
pressure to be perfect
seems like a lot —— we at

United States partially responsible for Iraq’s troubles

While fonner Enron CEO and major Republican donor
Ken Lay is busy cackling to himself about the millions of
dollars he stole, another major criminal with White House
contacts may be going to court ..

V With his recent acquisition of legal counsel,
Saddam Hussein. may soon be tried and found guilty
for being the murderous thug that he is.

Of course, it takes two to tango, and just as
Ashanti cannot be excused for singing the hook on Ja
Rule’s “Always on Time,” nor should the other party
in Saddam’s escapades be overlooked come trial
time.

That other party is the United States, which bears
direct responsibility for what are often cited as

Saddam’s worst crimes —- the uses of chemical
weapons against Iran and the Iraqi Kurdish popula-
tion during the 1980s.

The United States, notes the Christian Science

_ Monitor, “helped create Iraq’s deadly arsenal at the

time by supplying lethal»ingredient's, sophisticated facilities,
and a green light’ ’ to defeat Iran in whatever way possible.
That “green light” led to a level‘ of carnage surpassing even
Osama’s wildest ejaculatory fantasies — “100,000 people
were exposed to nerve agents like Sarin and Soman, and blis-
tering agents like mustard gas,” including the 10 thousand

' who “died almost immediatel ” at the hands of the U.S.-

backed Iraqi regime.

How touching, then, that The New York Tmes coolly
noted on March 29, 1984 — George Orwell references aside
— that “American diplomats pronounce themselves satis-

ﬁed with relations between Iraq and the United States,” just
a few weeks after the State Department explicitly stated that
“available evidence indicates that Iraq has used lethal chem-
ical weapons.” . _ __ i -
Those diplomats were led by
Middle East envoy Donald Rurnsfeld,
whose current infatuation with Iraq’s
supposed weapons of mass destruction
contrasts quite tellingly with his active
support of Iraq when they actually had
and were using such weapons.
Not content with providing just
chemical weapons, the United States
decided that Iraq also deserved $200 mil-
lion worth of helicoptersfrs must have
shocked Rurnsfeld and others who were
busy supporting Saddam’s brutality,
those are the same helicopters believed
by U.S. intelligence sources to be
“among those dropping the deadly bombs” and “poisonous
gas” on Kurdish civilians in 1988, according to the Los
Angeles Times.
If Americans are content to ignore these implications,
‘Iraqis are not. « ' .
“Saddam should not be the only one who is put on trial,”
said one Iraqi in a Reuters article. “The Americans backed

. him when he was killing Iraqis so they should be prosecut-

ed}, . ‘
Yet, as is common in the armals of young, wild-eyed
friendship, the two companions had an unfortrmate falling

out — a falling out that occurred when “Washington began
branding Saddam a tyrant and an enemy after his troops
invaded oil-rich Kuwait in 1990,” notes Reuters. ‘

Strategic interests supercede radical principles like
“democracy” and “human rights,” and so after President
Bush the First encouraged the Iraqi people to rise up against
Saddam at the end of_ the ﬁrst Gulf War, rebelling Iraqi gen-
erals asked the United States for access to captured weapons.
They were denied, and Saddam was allowed to use heli-
copter gunships to crush the rebellions of the Kurds in the
north and Shiites in the south.

The reason, which was clear to the centrist liberal New
York Times chief diplomatic correspondent Thomas
Friedman, was that what the United States really wanted was
to have “the best of all worlds: an iron-ﬁsted Iraqi junta with-
out Saddam Hussein.” ,

But, with the alternative being a popular uprising,
Saddamfs own iron-ﬁsted Iraqi junta would suﬁice.

Given this track record of support, the use of Saddam’s
transgressions to justify the war is, in the words of Arundhati
Roy, like “deifying Jack the Ripper for disemboweling the
Boston Strangler. And that after a quarter-century partnership
in which the Ripping and Strangling was a joint enterprise.

It’s an in-house quarrel. They’re business partners who "

fell out over a dirty deal. Jack’s the CEO.”
And, as the recent Enron debacle demonstrates, CEO’s
are never brought to justice.

No more carbs, meat for the U.S.’s sake

The United States is a nation of fear.

Unfortunately, our nervousness ‘regarding’

terrorism has spilled over into a new realm:

The war on vegetables began. An
Atkins-like program, The South Beach Diet,
charged tomatoes, carrots and com with the
same crimes as their starchy co-conspirators.
And then an anthrax-like
outbreak of Hepatitis A
swept through Butler
9 County. The culprit? A veg-
etable, of course. Green
onions became America’s
Most Wanted. After three
people died and 640 became
infected, a scallion boycott
began. The powers that be
were still unsatisﬁed, even
after otherwise harmless
vegetables were removed
from our diets.

. In response, the popula-
tion dedicated itself to consuming massive
amounts of meat We were still a nation of
big fat slobs. And so it was decided that meat

media began covering Mad Cow outbreaks
in Canada. Then the sneaky bastards crossed
our notoriously lax border and started a
splinter-cell in Washington. Fearing the
brain—wasting illness that can possibly result

from eating infected cows, people deemed

beef the new carbohydrate. Seeking solace
in protein, ﬁsh became a’ national symbol of

make people fat,” you protest. Ah, yes. But
isn’t it strange that the govemment-ﬁinded
FDA mentioned that light tuna contained
less mercury than its not-very-light relative?
In fact, doesn’t it sound like a conspiracy to
destroy big, fat slobs all across the country?
By the tirrre thepress leaked that butter
might have dangerous amounts of PCBs in
it, Americans didn’t care enough to even ﬁnd
out what PCBs were. What’s the use of but-

Buy Indie Music.com Compilation Vol. 1

Black Dog Promotions
72:1/2

Buy Indie Music’s Web site is a great promo-
tional tool for independent artists. It’s specifically
built so that independent artists pay a small fee
while the Web site sells their CDs and the promo-
tion team sub‘mits their Web site to thousands of
search engines, manages and creates mailing lists,
and does other online promotions so that indepen-
dent artists can start building up exposure to their
music. '

They also encourage their artists to submit their
music to be on the Buy Indie Music Compilation
series. They make this CD as a promotional tool
and send it to record labels and independent media
all over the country.

This CD has a little bit of everything to suit
your musical tastes, from hip-hop/R&B to
pop/emo. All in all, there are admirable efforts on
this first volume, but nothing on it seems capable
enough to get on any record label, whether it’s a
major or an indie. A

With its touch of hip-hop and R&B, Buy Indie

Indie artists get together
on promotional album  

Music.com Compilation Vol. 1 starts out with
Timothy Dark, a religious rap artist. He uses beats
similar to those used by Run DMC to relay his
positive messages. It would have been a mediocre
effort, but the soulful background vocals seem to
clash with his angry and powerful vocals.

Thealbum then goes on to “Wrap Me Up in
Your Love,” ‘another rip—off of ‘80s style, by
Emmet North Jr. It’s a cheesy ‘80s attempt at hip-
hop music in the style of Grandmaster Flash’s
“White Lines,” but with a lot less talent. “Players
Anthem” by Heat may be the only rap/R&B song
on the album that would be looked at by record
execs because it is about the one subject that seems
to be the inspiration of hip-hop today — “Getting
Booty.” -

This album covers all subgenres of rock ——
Southern rock, progressive and emo. The Southern
rock band The Shade is a conscious effort; they
sound like a combination of the music of The
Eagles and the vocals’ of Tom Petty. They sound
like the band that always does live covers of coun-
try music at your local block party. Weak attempts
at hard rock by bands like Informer, Shadow Point
and Purge d.i. make you feel sorry for the bands

because they try so hard to bring back badass ‘80s
rock, but you know they will be opening up for
Whitesnake at a small club in Boston. -
There isn’t a lot of substantial talent inthe 14
different bands and artists on this CD. Instead of
creating new, fresh music,'they are all trying hard to .
be something that was either popular 20 years ago
or copying styles off of major artists today. But it’s‘

an admirable effort by Buy Indie Music to get oth— ’

erwise unheard artists a chance to be heard. Next
time, let’s hope they get more selective in the
process.

-Amy Williams, staff writer

A summer away from the “other” can still work out

I have this theory. It goes something like this:
“Breaking up is hard to do.”

Even’ though Shelley Fabares said it better, I’m
sure we can admit that we’ve all had a crush that, well,
just crashed. Some people end things because they
just aren’t going well. Arguing over -who ate the last
sour cream—and-onion chip is a good sign that a cou-
ple should take some time apart. But others end the
romance because they’re scared of ﬁnding someone
they can’t be apart from. '

With people graduating and going home for
the summer while others stay behind, we must
decide whether The Rolling Stones were correct in
singing that wild horses couldn’t drag them
away. _

Jewel had her own rendition. I’m sure your
favorite version is playing in your head right now.

So my question to you is: Should relationships
ﬁzzle away if the couple is living apart from each
other? V

We’ve all had our share of summer ﬂings. You go

V to the beach with your family one summer, and, likeaa
clip outof “Grease,”_ ﬁnd your own John Travolta or ‘

Olivia Newton-John. You sharecheeseburgers and hot

fudge sundaes at the local diner. You dance ,infy,our"
. underwear and sing with your girlfrien_c_lsgat_.slumber;

parties. You drive -_—_ ﬂy —f off into the sunsetl. ‘ ..

\  ,

- The differ~
ence? Well, first, this
isn’t the ‘50s. And
it’s not the movies.
But lastly, if you’re
with someone you’re
about to be
distanced
from, if
you have
a good

end it?

THE PITT NEWS

The “Fastest Rapper in
the World” performs

Chicago is about to be represented
in Pittsburgh in a different capacity
than deep-dish, pizza. Midwest rapper
Twista arrived on the emcee scene
from Chicago’s West Side in 1991 with
his unique, * fast style of rap.
Eventually,,;TWi$,§a rapped his way into
the Guinness B561: ‘of i'W5'fll‘tl ‘ Records
asthé “Fa"s'test -Rapper in the World’? in
1992. His speed and clever lyrics make
him a favorite rap artist among the
Midwest set, and he’s set to conquer
the east and west coast.

In addition to being a rapid rapper, '

Twista has also produced songs for
artists such as P. Diddy, J ay-Z and Nas.

He also ran his own independent label,,

Legit Ballin’. After Twista’s first
album, Runnin’ oﬂ at Da Mouth, was
released in 1991, he disappeared from
the scene for almost six years before
he came back with his sophomore
album, Adrenaline Rush. Afterwards,
Twista focused on producer and guest
spots on other rapper’s albums as well
as working with all the artists -on his
label. But after years of being behind

.. “the. scenes, Twista takes frontistage

again, teaming up with Roe-A-Fella

Records for his third album, Kamikaze.

Unlike his other albums, Kamikaze
has achieved mainstream commercial
success, making it his first record to go
platinum. Over the radio waves, Twista
is currently known for his single “Slow

Jamz” featuring Jaime Foxx and‘

Kanye West. His more recent single,
“Overnight Celebrity,” also features
Kayne West and Twista’s tongue trip-
ping lyrics and fast beats.

With Kamikaze, Twista was able to
show the range of his style, going from
fast rapping _to slower rapping with
songs about drinking as well _as ones
that are ..strictly for the ladies. The
same variety that’s found in his album
is sure to be found in his live show.
The audience will" also get the chance
to experience for themselves why he

was named the “Fastest Rapper in the‘

World.”

Twista will be performing an all-
ages show at the Rock Club on
Thursday at 9 pm. Tickets cost $22.

Pitt sweep

JIMMY JOHNSON
Staff Writer

Pitt starting pitchers PJ. Hiser and Nick
Evangelista combined to strike out 17
Mountaineers in two wins at West Virginia
on Saturday — including a 2-0 shutout in
game one.

“[[t] we don’t make an error in the bot-
tom of the eighth, we throw two shutouts,”
head coach Joe J ordano said.

The two wins on Saturday made up for
Pitt’s two losses at Rutgers on Thursday,
however, the losses moved'Pitt (19-8 over-
all, 7-3 Big East) down to fourth place in the
Big East behind Notre Dame, Rutgers and
St. John’s.

Rutgers 4, Pitt 0

Rutgers pitcher Jack Egbert collected
his ﬁfth win of the season with seven score-
less innings of work against the Panthers in
game one of two on Thursday. Pitt managed
only three hits in the game — two of which
came from the ﬁrst two Panther batters.

“Rutgers just had some solid pitching,”
J ordano said.

The Scarlet Knights’ bats, however,

Softball loses doubleheader to Hokies

DAVID SHEAROUSE
Staff Writer

The Pitt softball team dropped both

games of their doubleheader with Virginia
Tech on Saturday in Blacksburg, Va.,
despite receiving solid performances from
senior catcher Heather Andrews and
sophomore pitcher Christa Hunter. The
loss dropped the Panthers to 16-22 for the
season and 1-5 on the year in conference
play.

“[Andrews and Hunter were] hitting
the ball real well,” Pitt softball head coach
Michelle Phalen said. “It’s unfortunate that
when they’re coming up sometimes it’s not
with runners on [base]. They’re hitting the
ball well, which is good to see.”

Virginia Tech 7, Pitt 4 ‘

The ﬁrst game of the day started out
well for Pitt" as Hunter belted a three-run
homer in the top of the ﬁrst to\ give the

Panthers a 3-0 lead. Virginia Tech (30-14;
. 6-4 Big East) tied the game in thethird,

inning when Hokie second ‘baseman
Shanel Garofalobatted in Sarah Prosise
and Kelly Brown, and later scored orra

ble through two mistakes by Pitt, one on a
wild pitch and the other on a throwing
error by Andrews. 1

“Our defense has looked a lot better in
previous games,” Phalen said. “We
weren’t sharp with regard to hitting our
cuts from the outﬁeld and ﬁelding the balls
cleanly and holding the runners to just one
base.”

The Hokies took the lead for good in
the bottom of the fourth inning when
Mindi Wylie led off the inning with a solo
home run to left ﬁeld. Virginia Tech added
another run in the ﬁfth imiing before
Andrews connected on a homer for Pitt in
the top of the sixth inning, making the
score 6-4. Unfortunately for the Panthers,
the Hokies added another run in the bottom
of the sixth to make the ﬁnal score 7-4.

For Pitt, freshman Laura Belardinelli
struck out two and walked two in 4 and

one-third innings of work, ‘while surrender-

ing sixruns on nine

  Phalen added. “We ‘ needed to step up in '

game shut out to earn the win for the
Hokies. Pacheco allowed no runs on six
hits in seven innings of work.

“She [Pacheco] did a good job,”
Phalen said. “She ﬁelded two balls and
then she got a glove on a ball to deﬂect it
to the shortstop to slow it down a bit to
keep the ball in the inﬁeld and allow the
shortstop to make the play on it.”

V1rginia'Tech recorded two runs in the
second inning to put the game out of reach.

The Hokies added a run in the fourth when.

Allyson Campbell scored on a hit by
Ashley Yeager.

Freshman Meghan Bostick took the
loss for the Panthers as she gave up three
runs on six hits in 3 and one-half innings of
work while striking _out one and walking
two. Hunter and Andrews continued their

hot streaks at the plate as Hunter went two- ,

for-three and Andrews belted her  dou-
ble of the season. ~ '

Fitzgerald is a
better choice
for Chargers

  

Ole Miss. quarterback Eli Manning is
projected to be the ﬁrst overall pick in the
2004 NFL Draft, but maybe that should
depend on which team ends up picking
ﬁrst -

As of right now, the San Diego

‘Chargers hold the ﬁrst pick, but the New

York “football” Giants have inquired about
the pick. To me it wouldn’t make sense for
San Diego to go after Manning because the

‘Chargers already have invested in quarter-

back Drew Brees. Brees had a poor season
in 2003, but you can’t just give him the ax
after one poor year.
In2002,hisﬁrstfullseasonasSar_1
Diego’s starting quarterback, Brees com-
pleted 60.8 percent of his passes, threw for
3,284 yards and connected for-17 touch-
downs against 16 interceptions. That’s not

too bad for a second year player who did _

not have a big time receiver. ’

Last season, Brees had wide receiver
David Boston, as well as ,LaDainian
Tomlinson, one of the best rtmning backs in
the NFL. Boston was a disappointment this
season, even though he had 70 catches
along with seven touchdowns. But he only
had 800 yards receiving.

However, Tomlinson has been consis-
tent over his three-year career in the NFL.
He has rushed for over 1-,0()0 yards each
season and in the last two has eclipsed the
1,500-yard rushing plateau. He also led the
Chargers in receptions with 100 in 2003.

That’s acrying shame, which leads me
to what position San Diego needs to con-

cemitselfwith——widereceiver.:Obviously, . «
the Chargers need to look no further than '

Pitt’s. own Larry Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald is
arguably the best receiver coming out of
college and could team with Breesand

.'-,'

Larry Fitzgerald, Chevon Troutman,
Chris Taft and Rod Rutherford —— you
know these guys, right? Think you may be
a Pitt sports fan? OK, now try these two:
PJ. Hiser and Nick Evangelista. These two
premiere athletes’ names go unrecognized, a
and you may casually walk by them, as
well as the rest of the roster, on the street
without even knowing it.

' With the football team failing to seal
up a Bowl Championship Series trip by
losing to Miami and West Virginia along

P with the basketball team being sent home

from the Sweet 16 for the third straight
year in a row, many would be led to
believe the sports seasons have come to an
end in Oakland. .

But those of you who have madethe
trip up past the Cost Center to Trees Field
to witness a baseball game, know different.
As you might know, Hiser was just named
to Baseball America’s‘ mid-season All-
America team by leading Pitt in home
runs, RBIs and slugging percentage, while
remaining unbeaten on the mound.

Perhaps you may even know that
Evangelista has returned for his senior sea-
son and is once again proving his domi-
nance on the mound with a 4-1 record and
was noticed by Baseball America as the
39th best senior prospect in the pre-season.

These two, along with the rest of the
small senior core, have led a predominate-
ly young Pitt baseball team to a 19-8 over-
all record and 7-3 mark in the Big East
after a doubleheader sweep _of West
Virginia on Saturday. The team has their
sights set on the Big East tournament this
year, as well as the NCAA tournament.

College baseball, like basketball, has
its own version of a 64-team NCAA tour-
nament. The ﬁnal eight teams then com-

pete in what is known as the College

‘World Series, which is held every year in

Omaha, Neb. _

As in basketball, teams need to win
their conference tournament or receive an
at-large bid to make the tourney. Pitt
missed out on the Big East tournament
with a 13-13 record last year and haven’t
been since 2000, because only the top four
teams in the conference advance to the
tournament.

Pitt currently sits fourth in the confer-
ence and was recently selected by Baseball
America’s mid-season college report to
earn an at-large bid to the NCAA touma-
ment as a No. 3 seed in the Southern
Mississippi regional. While the mid-sea-
son report has nothing to do with the final

‘seeds, it does show that Pitt is being

noticed nationally by those who-cover col-
lege baseball. ' '

This is a team that has gone relatively
unnoticed in the Pittsburgh_ sports world
and has improved greatly since the hiring

’ of head coach Joe Jordano in 1998. As

expectations begin to grow each season,
more students and fans need to step up and
help place the baseball program on the
same level of recognition that the football
and basketball programs have grown
accustomed to in the<Big East.

Upcoming Big East games with ﬁrst-
place Notre Dame will prove to be a huge
step in the right direction for Pitt if it can
knock off the No. 9-ranked Fighting Irish.
In fact, the series. just might be a preview
of the Big East tournament in May.

While the aforementioned Hiser and
Evangelista are leading coach Jordano into
the NCAA tournament for the first time
with Pitt, you may want to take note of
their names come early June for Major
League Baseball’s amateur player draft.

Evangelista, who was drafted last year
in the 24th round by the Blue Jays, and
Hiser may join recent Pitt standouts Brant
Colamarino (Athletics) and Brad Rea
(Pirates) in the minor leagues on their jour-
ney for a shot in the big show.

Adam Luckette came in to pitch after

Chargers need to hold on to first overall pick

Nocks, page 10

him at least one season before he breaks out.

While Manning does have a promising
future in the NFL, the amount of talent he
possesses and the Manning legacy he is fol-
lowing —— as he is the son of former New
Orleans Saints quarterback Archie Manning
and brother of current Indianapolis Colts
quarterback Payton Manning —may not be
factors if he does not have any wide
receivers to throw the ball to.

Currently the Chargers have former
Tennessee Titan wide receiver Kevin
Dyson, who has never had a l,0()0—yard
receiving season during his six-year career

and has battled injuries the past two seasons.
Tim Dwight is San Diego’s other experi-
enced wideout and also has never had 1,000
yards receiving in a season. Both of these
wide receivers will be 29 this season and
will not pose a serious challenge to premier
defensive backs.

San Diego made a critical mistake by
trading Boston to the Miami Dolphins.
Boston will be 26 this season and teaming
up with Fitzgerald, along with the Chargers’
running‘ game would have resurrected his
career as well as Brees’. Injuries and per-
sonal problems have slowed Boston, but
with his size and speed he was bound to
break out of his slump, especially if he had
a complement.

All San Diego had last season was a
running game, and they have already parted
ways with Boston, who was part of the solu-
tion to its offense. Hopefully, it will not give

. up on Brees, who is a talented quarterback,

because I’m not sure that Manning would
fare any better with what the Chargers cur-
rently have at wide receiver.

It may seem like I’m being a homer, but
considering that the Chargers have the ﬁrst
pick, it makes sense for Fitzgerald to be
selected number one overall. San Diego
needs to tell the Giants they are keeping the
ﬁrst pick and make the right decision on
April 24.
