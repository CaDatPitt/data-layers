Pitt star tailback IeSean McCoy

either stayin school for another year
or enter the 2009 NFL Draft

McCoy said after Pitt’s win over
West Virginia — along with several

that he expected to have McCoy back

Pitt students, professors react to conflict in the Gaza strip

by Jayson Myers
Staﬂ Wrder

Students and professors are
decidedly split when it comes to
recent events in Gaza.

Members of Jewish A student

groups, such as Chabad, House,"

said they ‘believe firmly in the
validity of Israeli aggression in
Gaza, where casualties continue
to mount. The Muslim Student
Association and the Students for

i Justice in Palestine argued that

Palestine has a legitimate claim
to the Israeli territory.

Gaza Strip into Israeli territory
quickly grew more frequent, and

Pitt professors also disagreed Israel conducted air strikes in re-

about who’s to blame

_for the current solu-

tion and what should
be done to fix it.

A _truce between
Israel and Hamas ex-
pired Dec. 19, accord-
ing to The New York
Times. Pale’stinians- ﬁr-

Israel got ‘sickiof it and

is that Israel attacked

Shihade. “That’s the ofﬁcial nar-

also claims that Hamas broke the
cease-fire agreement between the
Israeli government and Hamas.”

In Shihade's opinion, the
reality is something quite dif-
ferent. Citing unnamed “news

he said that he believes Is-

Staﬁ’ Writer

Pitt’s Greek organizations will
try something a little different this
semester: cooperation. ‘

“We’re trying to work together
because we all are Greek. We all
wear the same letters, so we should
coordinate activities,” said Molly

Panhellenic Conference at Pitt. -
In the past, Panhellenic sorori-
ties and fraternities in the North_-
American Interfraternity Council
and historically black Greek orga-
nizations inthe National Panhel—
lenic Council have each worked
separately within thePitt commu-
nity. , .
NPHC President Jada Ginyard
said the main reason for the sepa-
ration comes from differences

in how the organizations were

founded.
, “Panhel and IFC focus more
on philanthropy and raising mon-

ey for causes, whereas NPHC is _

rooted more in community ser-
vice,-” she said. ’
-But the ultimate goal of build-

-ing a better community is the same

for all the organizations, Ginyard
said, and acknowledging the need
for inter—conference unity is just
the ﬁrst step.

“It takes a while for groups
that are not used to working to-
gether to start programming to-
gether. There will maybe be one
tri—council event this semester,”
she said.

I As yet, there has been no dis-
cussion on what the tri-council
event might look like.

The structure of the Greek
system can also make cooperation
difficult. In addition to respond-
ing to national conferences or
councils and their respective area
advisers, each fraternity and soror-

, ity is also governed by individual

national chapter headquarters.

Each national Greek organiza-
tion maintains a certain level of
autonomy within the conference
or council, including the ability to
set membership criteria and desig-
nate philanthropy recipients.

As a result, individual sororities
and fraternities may sponsor their
own events, set minimum GPA re-

Chabad House, as all sides call for peaceful resolution

Conflict, page I A
rael‘ broke the cease—ﬁre agreement,
instead of the other way around.

Ari Daniel Miller, a Pitt student asso-
ciated with Chabad House and a number
of other Jewish organizations on campus,
asserted Israeli innocence.

“Israel got sick of it and decided to
act,” said Miller of the events that began
last month.

Though Miller said that Chabad House

has not yet done anything in response to
the attacks on Gaza, he predicted that the
group will most likely make an effort to
educate the public about the situation.

Miller added that he hoped the situa-
tion would end peacefully.

“I think it’s part of the Jewish under-
standing of how the world works that you
are supposed to love your neighbor as
yourself,” said Miller. ,

Jonas Moffat, the leader of Pitt Stu-
dents for Justice in Palestine, said he
hopes for a OIlC,"St3.tC‘SO.lutiOI1.

“I believe that as it existed before, with
Jews and Muslims and Christians sharing
the same land  Israel and Palestine can
exist as one state,” said Moffat. “I don’t
believe that two states could ever function
as a functioning economy for either side
or a functioning state in general.”

Where you belong.

Donald Goldstein, a professor at Pitt’s
Graduate Schooliof Public and Interna-
tional Affairs, ‘said that while the public
generally bases its opinion of the issue on
ethnic or religious background, the situa-
tion has a fundamentally political nature
and could only be solved if treated as such.

“Where you sit is where you stand,” he
said. “The issue is not religion. It’s never
been religion. It’s over who owns a piece

of property.”

Goldstein said that the issue will only
simmer when Palestine rec_eives land and
Israel receives an ensured border. He
maintained that resolution of the conflict
demanded the creation of a separate Is-
raeli state, brokered by 'the involvement
of the world’s most powerful nations.

“The only possible way [to solve the
conﬂict] would be for the great pow-
ers not just to talk about diplomacy but
to sit down and say, ‘You guys cut this
crap out,”’ said Goldstein, also suggest-
ing that the great powers state that “as of
today the U.N. controls Jerusalem, and
we’ll keep troops there and we’ll save the
shrine and maybe 15 or 20 years, when it
all blows over, they’ll all love each other.”

Bailout for Boscov’s? 

-Suburbia once formed the
thriving watering hole for fami-
lies of all strata. But now more
than ever, many mini-malls are
frequented only by tweens in
bejeweled bell-bottoms and the
occasional soccer mom, though
most have moved on to greener
pastures, like arnazon.com.

Boscov’s, a department store
chain headquartered in Reading,
has felt the effects. These trends
forced the store to ﬁle for bank-
ruptcy this sumrner. Pennsylvania
has asked seven counties to sign
off on a 20-year federal loan that
would keep Boscov’s in business.

The loan would give the chain,
which employs 5,000 people in
Pennsylvania, $35 million in feder-
al money guaranteed through the
US. Departrnent of Housing and
Urban Development, according to
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.

Before the state can secure
the loan, the seven affected coun-

their Community "Development

never desirable, but Pennsylvania’s
economy will certainly not crum-

Kevin's Deli, nestled inside Webster Hall, is both tasty and convenient /— some students don't even have to leave their building.

Kevin's Deli

Webster Hall
4415 Fifth Ave.
Suite 120
41 9-621 -6368

Kevin’s Deli is a chancejto be
a part of something larger than
yourself, just by eating delicious
food. i

‘‘I’m not just out to make a
buck,” said the restaurant's name-
sake, leaning with one elbow on
the edge of the 2.5-foot counter

-of his deli. “I’m‘ out to make a

friend. That’s just howl am.”
Take a right at the main en-

trance of Webster Hall, at the in-

tersection of Fifth and Belleﬁeld

avenues, and follow the faint hint

of grease in the air as you near

your destination. On the right-
hand side of the hall, in the only
door frame without an accompa-
nying door, resides Kevins Deli.

Because most of the suites in
Webster Hall are large and home
to businesses, I expected Kevin’s
Deli to be a sit-down place, a
nook where one could take shelter
from the storm, sip a cup of cof-
fee and savor delectable breakfast
fare. Kevin’s is all-of these things,
you just have to stand to do it.

Peering around the edge of the
doorway, the narrow deli made
space for a cold case stocked with
a motley assortment of vitamin
waters, sodas, applesauce and rice
pudding.

To the right, a silver, no-frills
commercial refrigerator on the
right—hand wall. There was just
enough room for three or four

people to stand in front of the

deli case, ﬁlled with classic offer-
ings of the tuna and chicken sal-
ad, sliced meats and greens. The
window at the back of the room
looked up at the pavement out-
side, people’s feet coasting by.
The man at the grill looked
up at my bleary-eyed compatriot
and me and then back to the grill.
We peered» at the day’s spe-
cials (Reuben or tuna salad) and
the sign board on the wall, which
listed the deli’s breakfast and
lunch options, classics that range
in price from $2.50 to $6.75.
With little hesitation, my com-
panion and I ordered two break-

',’fast sandwiches — a sausage,

egg and cheese and one egg and
cheese. W I .

As the eggs started to splut-
ter, customers came in, and the
deli worked processed several or-
ders at once. Standing to the side

I tried not to take out Webster

Hall’s occupants with my back-

pack.
‘ In business since 1984, the

deli didn’t become Kevin’s Deli M

until 2004.

With the help of a fax ma-
chine, the owner's of Kevin's Deli
are now trying to spread word
about his business to University

departments and students — well V

known for their appreciation for
hot, affordable food.

“You know, some people say,
in business you have to be hard,
mean, make all the money you
can. I’m not like that.” As he said
so, my was popped down on
the counter, wrapped efﬁciently
in deli paper ’— two envoys of
steaming happiness.

“Is that all?” asked Kevin,
moving toward the register. He
rang up our $6.50 bill — the two

sandvzicheii and. an orange-tan-
gerine Life‘-Water. He pulled out
$3 of change and handed it to me
with a smile.

“Thanks for coming, I hope
to see you here again, soon,” he
said. I assured him I would be.

“And take this,” he said, pop-
ping a slice of pound cake into
the paper bag, “it’s my last piece.”
Witli that he picked up the phone
and waved. ‘

My buddy and I retired to a
nearby bench and tore through
the deli paper. The perfect
amount of cheese separated egg
from toasty bread —-'—i'a moder-
ated dose of grease provided just
the right note of ’ comfort food
while packing a protein punch.

But more than anything, our
breakfast carried the elusive note

of good food made in good spir—_

Latin America's beauty and sadn

A Map of Latin
American Dreams

Silver Eye Center for
Photography

1015 East Carson St.

Through March 7,2009

Photographer Martin Weber
provides Latin Americans with
the opportunity to express their
‘dreams in their own words in his
exhibition at Silver Eye Center
for Photography.

The Center’s Fellowship 2008
award recipient, Weber’s photo-
graphs portray black-and—white
portraits of Latin Americans
holding up blackboards on which

‘§,‘jg;£$=“‘

they have written their hopes and

dreams. His artwork is a stunning
example of a social documentary
with a message determined by its
subjects.”

The portraits are solemn in

‘ black—and-white and clearly staged

in their carefully composed nar-
ratives. Their messages provide a
hopeful beacon of solace in the
midst of the subjects’ lives, which
are represented by the heartbreak-
ing visual narrative. I

In one photograph, a family
sits around a table playing domi-
noes and passing the time, hold-
ing a sign that reads, “I dream of
one day returning home,” while in

another, a young girl sits on the‘

aluminum roof of a ramshackle
house holding a sign that wishes
“that one day [her] parents will

smile again.”

Often, the portraits also high-
light the serious undertones of
a seemingly innocent type of
dream, such. as a child’s aspira-
tions.~ In one piece, a young
girl hopes, “I want to be a po-
lice woman,” while a young boy
points a toy gun at her, increasing
the weight of her wish.

Weber, who is Argentinean,
currently living in Brooklyn, N.Y.,
began working on his ongoing
project in 1992 and has since

'‘ taken more than 160 images in

eight countries. Weber uses a
4—by—5—foot ﬁeld camera, which is
often used by large format pho-
tographers who need. portability,
to take. his photographs.

Weber prints each photograph
himself, which contributes to the
intimacyjof the projects, as he
uses his hands to develop dreams
that his subjects’ communicate
with their hands. By handwrit-

- ing their dreams and symboli-

cally holding their dreams in their
hands, the people in Weber’s_pho—

_ tographs utilize their power to

write the narrative of their own
lives, which many might not oth-
erwise have the chance to do.
“Many of these people live
in fear or poverty,” said Amanda
Bloomﬁeld, communications
manager at Silver Eye, “and We-

ber gives them the opportunity I

and power to express their desires
for a different and often better
life. By- participating in Weber’s
project, the people in his photo-
graphs are preserving their own

story and ability to dream.”

The Curious Case of
Benjamin Button

Starring Brad.Pitt and
Cate Blanchett ‘
Directed by David
Fincher

Paramount Pictures and
Warner Bros.

 

There are certain ﬁlms that de-
serve a massive roar of applause at
the end of the credits to acknowl-
edge the entire cast. I wish that the

backward

curtain would come up and out
would walk all the players, holding
hands and ‘taking one unison bow.

“The Curious Case of Benja-
min Button” is a delightful fan-
tasy that entertains with a perfect
ensemble cast, beautiful cinema-
tography, an intriguing story and
deserves a standing ovation.

Brad Pitt stars as Benjamin

‘Button: born‘_an old man who

with everyday becomes younger
and younger. The ﬁlm exposes
Benjamin’s life from the 19203 to

life makes for touching film

the 19705 and the extraordinary
people he meets.

“Curious Case” has one of the
best ensemble casts of any ﬁlm
this year. Most notable are Taraji
P. Henson as Queenie, the care-
taker of a nursing home that takes
inan abandoned Benjamin from
her doorsteps, and Tilda Swin-
ton as Elizabeth Abbott, an older
woman who starts an affair with
Benjamin. Both actresses truly
shine in creating lovable, interest-
ing characters that flow well with

the mysticism of the story.

Cate Blanchett always puts on
an enchanting performance, play-
ing Benjamin’s love, Daisy, but the
real gold medal must go to Pi_tt
in one of his most unforgettable
roles. ,

There is something enduring

‘about Pitt’s performance. Portray-

ing a man that looks like he’s 65
but acts like an 18-year-old takes
an extraordinary amount of talent.
For some of the ﬁlm, Pitt makes
us forget that Benjamin is aging

backward. For even just a brief
second, every audience member
thinks of Benjamin as just a man

thirsting for adventure and life.
However, once the magnitude
of aging backward hits us, we ask
questions that have no answer and
that no one may ever understand.
What is it like to age backward,
never ﬁtting in with any age group,
too young for the old people, too
old for the young people? What is
it like to know how much time you
' will live? What if Benjamin was

The 2008 fellowship received 299 sub-
missions from 35 states and two foreign
countries. This year’s exhibition also fea-

The fellowship’s goal is simply to share

the contemporary work of emerging and
mid-career photographers, both local and
international, with the Pittsburgh commu-

vary greatly from year to year.

born not an old man, but a man in his 20s,
aging backward to the inevitable end? ,
Some people have been disturbed by this
urmatural plot line, but “Curious Case” is
supposed to be a fantasy Benjamin’s aging
is a whimsical fluke of nature that makes us
question our own existence and ways.
“Curious Case” is one of the most
well-made movies this’ year. The cinema-

tography is captivating and the computer '

graphics seamlessly breathtaking. Alexandre
Desplat’s score continues to add to the fairy
tale ﬁlm with mystical chimes and piano.

_ Yet, before I go and say that “Curious

Case” is the greatest ﬁlm of the year, there-

is one complaint that must be addressed.
Button’s story is being told as an elderly
Daisy’s grown—up daughter reads his diary.
These in-between scenes take place in Au-

gust of 2005 in New Orleans during Hur— _

ricane Katrina.

Screenwriter Eric Roth made a danger-
ous rnistakeih putting these scenes of the
present in a  tale ﬁlm. “Curious Case”
does not need to be connected to the pres-
ent — the story can live alone in the past,
without a dying, hospital—ridden Daisy.-

Roth also makes a few more mistakes in
what I term Forrest Gump Disease, not in
regards to Tom Hanks’ character’s mental
disability, Roth’s (who penned “Forrest
Gump”) many clichesjand uncanny coinci-
dences in his movies.

While it’sg_easy to spot the symptoms of
FGD, it is  as effortless to ignore them.

I But if Rotlrinakes another ﬁlm and writes

the same  more, then I can ofﬁcially

put Forrest""Gump Disease into the 2009

Blair's doable-doable
leads to Panther win

by Zack Chakan
Armlrla/zl‘ Sparta Editor

St Johns played well enough in
the first half to challenge the team
that competed in its first contest
since being anointed as the top has-
ketball squad in the nation.

Instead, the Red Storm threw its
chances away — right into the hands
of Pitt, as the Panthers cruised to a
90-67 victory after heading to the
locker room with a five-point lead at
halftime

A smothering Pitt defense forced
24 turnovers, including four during a
crucial 17-6 stretch to start the sec-
ond half, and forced the Red Storm
into poor decisions all game

“We really wanted to force them
into some turnovers,” said Pitt coach
Jamie Dixon. “I think they just
wore down, you could see them get
trapped. in the corner throughout,
and that wears on you.”

Sophomore center Dejuan Blair

. again dominated the inside for the

Panthers, ﬁnishing with 23 points and
15 rebounds. The double—double was
his 10th in 14 games, and he added
six steals to his final tally.

Perhaps most importantly, when
Pitt struggled to connect on free
throws, Blair went 9—of-11 from the
line. Blair’s teammates combined to
go 5—of—12 from the charity stripe

“That’s what we’re going to need
down the stretch,” said Blair. “If you
watched Memphis last year, they
missed their free throws and didn’t
get it done in the national champion-
ship.”

“The team we’ve got, the depth
we’ve got, I think we’re going to get
fouled a lot because of the way we
rebound, free throws are going to
come in handy.”

Jermaine Dixon added a career-
high 17 points and four steals, and
Levance Fields just missed a double-
double of his own with 13 points and

Swimming and Diving

 Pitt packs the

pool, beats W V U

by Emily Steiner '
Staff l»VI'[ter

Both the Pitt men’s and women’s swim-
ming and diving teams won their “Pack
the Pool” meet against Big East rival West
Virginia on Saturday, defeating the Moun-
taineers 155.5-144.5 on the men’s side and
166.5-131.5 for the women.

The women improved their record to
3-1, 2-1 Big East, while the men evened
out their record to 2-2, 1-2. Both Pitt teams
beat West Virginia last season as well.

The win was especially important be-

cause of the length of the break the team ,

has had since the last dual meet, held in No-
vember at Cincinnati.

“It was just a good team win,” said se-
nior BJ. Conklyn. “It’s been two months
since we had a meet. I think we showed the
Big East that we’re ready to go.”

Conklyn placed second in the 100- and
200—yard breaststroke, but saw season—best
times in both.‘

Swimmers of the meet were juniors Allie
I-lorvath and Justin Corvin. Corvin won the
50 freestyle, placed third in the 100 freestyle
and was a member of the winning 400—yard
freestyle relay that secured Pitt’s victory.

On the men’s side, the score was up and
down all day, with the men leading by only
two points going into the last event.

Sweeping events and relays proved im-
portant. Pitt swept the 3—meter diving event,
with Alex Volovetski winning, followed by
Collin Forner and Zane McLain, in addition
to a near-sweep in the 50 freestyle. West
Virginia’s Brad Eichenseer and Pitt’s Otto
Pagel tied for third in that event.

“West Virginia brings out the best in the
swimmers and divers,” said Conklyn. “You
have to show up, you can’t just expect to
win.” ’

The women took the lead from the be-
ginning of the meet and just kept adding to
it. West Virginia won all but seven events,
but it was Pitt’s ability to get the second,
third and fourth place finishes that allowed
it to hang onto the lead.

Horvath picked up those extra points
with two fourth—place ﬁnishes in both back-
stroke events.

Sophomore Laura Barnes won both
breaststroke events and was a member of
the winning 200 medley relay along with
Ryann Kishbaugh, Caitlin Trant and Kris-
ten McMullan.

“I think we got a boost of confidence,”
said Barnes. “We’re going to go into Big
East hungrier now.”

Pitt will return to action when it travels
to College Park, Md., for a two—day meet
against Maryland, Penn State and Villano—
Va.

ing to shut him up by making them,” said
Blair.

While Blair has been getting the national
attention lately for No. 1 Pitt, Kennedy has
also been putting together a breakout year
for a young Red Storm team. He’s nearly
averaging a double—double per game with
13 points and 7.3 rebounds and scored 20
points and grabbed 10 rebounds in an up-
set of Notre Dame on Jan. 3. On Sunday,
Kennedy never came out of the game and
ended up with a team—high 18 points and
seven rebounds, even though Blair is farnil—
iar with his game as anybody. _

“He’s the same D.].,” said Blair. “He’s a
heck of a player. That’s how he was in high
school. I was trying to tell [my teammates]
he likes to pump fake a lot, and he got us a

couple times, but his whole team did that.
He did a good job this game, because last
game he wasn’t shooting at  in the Gar-
den, but he did that today.”

That last game was an 81-57 Pitt win
ori  23, 2008, at Madison Square Gar-
den in New York City, where St. John’s
plays its home games. Kennedy had seven
points compared to Blair’s 10 and relished
the chance to play in front of family and
friends in his hometown for the first time
in college.

“It was a great atmosphere,” said Ken-
nedy. “I was just proud of myself I got to
play in front of my family and hometown
crowd.” .

He even ‘told that to Blair when the two
met each other and embraced after the na-

St. John's, page 9
nine assists. -

Senior forward Sam Young had an off day,
making only ﬁve of his 15 attempts. He ﬁnished
with 12 points — his second-lowest amount of
the season.

Pitt (15—0, 3-0 Big East) triumphed in its
ﬁrst—ever game as the No. 1 team in college bas-
ketball The Panthers top both the Associated
Press and the USA Today/ ESPN polls. Fields
said the team was a little bit excited, but didn’t let

1 the  affect its psyche

“It’s the first time in history, so we’d be lying
if we said it wasn’t [exciting] ,” said Fields. “Other
than that, it doesn’t really affect what were do-
ing. None of us on this team have big heads.”

Sophomore forward DJ. Kennedy paced the
Red Storm with 18 points and seven rebounds,
while Rob Thomas and Sean Evans added 13
apiece for St. John’s (10-5, 1-2 Big East), which
was coming off an upset over then—No. 7 Notre
Dame last Saturday.

The game was a homecoming for Kennedy, .

a Pittsburgh native and teammate of Blair at
Schenley  School. _
“It was a great atmosphere,” said Kennedy.

if “It’s a big game for me, the outcome wasn’t so

good, but I’m just happy I got to play in ﬁont
of my own family.” 1

The Panthers defense clamped down on
St John’s young lineup immediately. The Red
Storm committed ﬁve turnovers before the

' first media timeout only four minutes into the

game‘ .
Pitt was sloppy with the ball, as well. St.

A ]ohn’s settled down and took advantage of four

spark Panthers on both sides

. miscues to stick with the Panthers. Quincy Rob-

erts’ 3—point play with.11:52 to go in the first
half put the Red Storm up 17-15. .

Ugly play continued with both sides, But St.
Johns minimized its mistakes to remain on top
of the Panthers. A jumper by Kennedy made
the score 29-26 with 5:36 to go in the half.

The back and forth battle continued, until
the mostly neutralized Young exploded for two
huge plays.

First, Young blocked a shot attempt by Ty-
Shawn Edmondson and then received the ball
ﬁom Jermaine Dixon on ‘an outlet pass Young
tossed the ball to Gilbert Brown for a thunder-
ous alley—oop dunk.

After a St; ]ohn’s basket, Fields emerged
from a scrum with a loose ball, fired a line drive
to Young under the hoop for another jam that
left the sellout Petersen Events Center crowd in
a ﬁenzy at halftime with a 41 -36 advantage.

Jermaine Dixon used the whole floor to give
the Panthers some breathing room. The junior
scored seven of Pitt’s ﬁrst nine points after the
half on two layups and a 3-pointer, as Pitt ran
to its first double-digit lead of the contest at
50-40.

Two straight 3-pointers from Fields and

Young and a.Young runner sucked the spiiit .

out of the Red Storm. The eight straight points
capped a 17-6 run and pushed Pitt’s lead to
5842, and the rout was on.

After three weeks away from home, Pitt will
play its second straight game at the Petersen
Events Center Wednesday against South Flor-
ida at 7 p.m.

“The first five of our six Big East matchups are

coach Agnus Berenato said the offensive struggle
for the Panthers is a problem that needs to be
dealt with. . -

“Our offense really hurt us,” said Betenato

after the game “We have to have more offend‘

sive weapons than Shavonte. Down the stretch
we also missed critical rebounds and ﬁtee throws.
You can’t win like that.”

In the last six minutes, the Panthers missed
five ﬁree throws totaling 17-25 for the night. In

 Pitt free throw shooting shows improvementini second half

fering from the same problem that it‘ has
for years: its bafﬂingly inconsistent and at
times abysmal free-throw shooting.

In the first half, the entire Pitt team only
made one more free throw than Kennedy
alone, shooting 7-15 from the line — less
than 50 percent. The Panthers, however,
shot 7-8 from the line in the second half,
and Blair made 9-of-11.

As successful as Pitt has been in the last
decade since Ben Howland took over the
program in 1999, dismal foul shooting has
seemed to be a constant. Up until Sunday,
however, Pitt wasn’t.fairing too poorly from
the line, shooting 66.8 percent as a team,
just slightly worse than its opponents’ mark
of 71.8 percent. '

“That’s what we’re going to need down
the stretch,” said Blair. “If you watch Mem-
phis last year, they were missing freethrows
and they didn’t win the national champion-
ship. The way we rebound and crash the
boards, we get fouled a lot. If we would
have made our free throws, we might have
got 100, so we need to work on that.”

Dixon rebounds

Jermaine Dixon rebounded in a big way
from perhaps his worst game of the season
on Jan. 3 at Georgetown.

Dixon scored just two points on 1—of-7

' shooting in Pitt’s biggest win of the year at

Georgetown on 3, and looked tentative

at times, passing-up several open shots.
Any carry-over from that performance

was soon forgotten, though. Dixon ended

I up with 17 points on 7—of-12 shooting,

scoring aggressively on fast breaks, baseline
drives and pulling open looks from 3-point
range. He also had four steals. -

“Jermaine got a couple passing lane
steals, got the crowd into it, and we kind
of put the game away,” said Levance Fields.
“Jermaine’s doing a great job getting extra
shots up before and after practice, and he
was goo.d today.”
