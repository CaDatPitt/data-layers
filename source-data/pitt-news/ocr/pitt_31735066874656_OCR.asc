Congress Discusses

Political Policies
SC Recommends Lowering Required
Number of Party Backers to 100

By AL LEFFLER _
The party system proposal,_ after‘ a three-hour airing
by Men’s Council was given another two-hour workout to
meet with the ﬁnal approval of Student Congress, at their

Monday, Jan. 17, meeting.

Bob Wilkins, Men’s Council representative to SC, sub-
mitted the proposal in two sections, objectives and general
rules, each to be discussed and approved separately, before
being sent to the Student» Elections Committee, Charles
Elliott assistant to the dean of men protested. to the third

point in the objectives to establish standards of operation.

for the presently existing unrecognized parties. He likened
it to recognition of a mythical Crimelnc.
A group of solons immediately voted for the approval

’ of the objectives. SC attempted to pick out the loopholes‘ in

°the general regulations section.

Election
Committee

To Meet

The Student Election Com-
mittee may meet this Thurs-
day to discuss political par-
ties. _

. Men’s Council will submit
to the Committee the proposal
approved at last Wednesday

, night’s open meeting. It pro-

vides for the establishment
and ’ regulation, of political
parties at Pitt.

Under MC’s, system a party
could" be recognized for thedura-.

tion of one spring semester upon.

the mustering of 250 signatures to
a petition. . Membership cards

would cost 25 cents. One hundred O’

and seventy-ﬁve dollars would be
the limit for campaign expendi-
tures. The proposal applies only
to men students. ,
The Student Election. Com-
mittee is composed of the presi-
dent and one appointed repre-
sentative from both Student
Congress and Men’s Council, the '
‘president and chief justice of
Women’s Self Government As-
sociation, one representative
from Alpha Phi Omega. service
fraternity, plus organinzation
advisors.
Members ‘of the Committee at-

tended the MC open meeting with.

speaking privileges, but could not
Vote. /

If the Committee passes some
form of political party system con-
cerning men, it will go to the Dean
of Men’s Office for final judg-

ment. If women are included in-

the program, ‘Dean of Women’s
Office must also approve it.

Jack Hardman of the Dean of
‘Men’s Office, who is advisor to
Men’s Council, declined to ap-
prove any one system of politi-
cal parties, but he does favor
the general principle.

He has the job of regulating and
advising st u d e n t government
activities, and he feels that with

formal parties he could advise

them “in a normal way” instea<%
of trying to supervise groups tha
“do not claim to exist.” . _ '_
As the Men’s Council proposal
stands, political parties would be

initiated this spring.

Although the discussion on each
point was to be limited to five

minutes, and the order of the day,

set 5:30 p.m. as a deadline, con-
stant points of order and informa-
tion stretched the meeting to over
two hours.

_ V Eight Changes

Eight recommended. c h a n «g e s
emerged from the many motions
and proposals.

Instead of requiring a minimum
party registration of 250, SC asks
for only 100, all men.

' Through Dean, Biddle’s sugges-

Q ' «

- tion, responsibility for. collection
of party dues has been lifted from

the Student Desk, given entirely
to the party organizers.

SC would not hold ‘anyone re-
sponsible for the return of the

dues should the party become de-

funct. MC’s proposal holds the stu-
dent desk and the party organi-
ners responsible for returning the
ee. ~
Limited Membership Sale
. They also limited the sale of
membership ‘cards to the spring
semester ‘prior tothe elections. If
a party member wishes to with-
draw,’ SC, does not require the
1'eCe1V1Dg chairman to remove his
party’s
roll. . -
The solons‘ asked that the ini-
tial meeting to elect officers be
called by the Dean ofiMen’s Of.
fice in consultation with the
party organizers and that it be"
publicized beforehand. I
Their last revision was to add

, the words “per party” to the bud-

get limit. As points throughout the
meeting, especially a f t e r the
lengthy discussion, Am e m b e r s
voiced their disapproval of “an
apparently weak outline.” Dick
Murphy, Engr. ’56, complained
that there are too. many loopholes.
Intergration of Women

Betty Ann Yougn, Ed., ’56 set
a committee injmotion to look in-
to the integration of women into
the proposed party system. ‘

Tho. Panther Poll, which was

to have come up under new.

business, showed the student

body “overwhelmingly in favor

of the humor magazine revival.”
New business was shortened to

Downtown Papers
Make Much Ado
Over Twirlers 
‘ By BERNICE» M. COHEN_ 

Two downtown newspapers
have Pitt faculty and students
up in arms over articles pub-
lished in Monday and Tues-
day papers. ;

All the uproar was created
when the Post-Gazette got
windof women forming a twirling
corps at Pitt.

Before most students were
aware of the matter, one paper
said the students were divided. —

The Sun Telegraph said, “The
ﬁght for women’s, suffrage has
shifted to the University of Pitts-
burgh . . . The mere me-ntion of
such newfangled ideas has. divided
Pitt scholarsi into.’ two Waring i
groups.”

Mention of women twirlers was
made in the Pitt News last Friday
when a news article stated the
following: _ .

“Under the leadership of Larry
Cervi,_ Pitt drum major, the
Women’s Twirling Corps is t-o be
primarily known as an interest
group. Cervi said if the venture
proves successful, the group will
cia-ls.” ‘ ‘

The downtown papers initial
-article was concluded from a col-
umn, written by Sam Morton, Pitt
News reporter, who took a deﬁin-
rite stand on the issue.

Cervi said, “Twirlers will not be
Pitt band members.” He hopes to
have the women twirling. during
halftime‘ at home football contests
when Pitt has no visiting band,“
in parades, ‘and at high schools
where the Pitt Band appears.
Cervi also said, “maybe Pi.tt’s
Band will move in back of the
ﬁeld and play when the twirlers
perform.” He does not believe the
two group-s should perform si-
multaneously for the girls would.
distract from theband sh-ow. ,

» Many faculty members were not
informed of the impending “crisis”

the Pirtt News. All’ agreed that the
issue was being emphasized with-
out cause. ’ ,

After enlightenment on the con-
rtroversy, the maj—ority"st-ated that
it is hard to visualize twirlers
being a part of any’ band.

Robert L. Arthur, Pitt Ba.nd
director, said, “The Pitt Band
feels that . they are above O’ this
controversy. Majorelttes were de-

when they were interviewed by U

veloped by high schools with small

bands in order to get enough per-

..sonnel to make formations. Pitt's

120 piece band are musicians and
entertainers themselves. In the
true sense a band needs only one
drum major or maiorette to lead
the group.

“Pitt follows the Big Ten ruling
which prohibits women in the
band. We foll-ow military lines and
women _are not called for. In fact,
the younger the girls, the more
effective they are.” . '

Miss Helen Rush, dean of
women, commented, “Majorette
work as a c-ollege activity does not
belong in a university.” - we

“I don’t think twirlers have a

place at Pitt” said Warren Neiger,
gymnastics coach. He continued,
“I can’t see why Pitt should go out
on a limb. We should keep im-
proving on women cheerleaders
who do add prestige to athletic
events.” _ ‘
' Dean of Men, Theodore Biddle
said, “The Pitt Band is a marching
and performing organization and
has no place for women in its
setup. Girls would be-very inci-
dental and would add very little.
I can’t visualize girls working
with the Pitt Ban-d.”

Tom Hamilton, athletic director.

said, "I think it is an interesting

student activity. The band and the A

women should get’ together. Al-
though we have a very ﬁne band
(HOW.
willing to. recognize twirlers, so
would I.” , . .

“'l'*he whole idea is high sch-ool-
ish,” according to Richard Cun-
ningham, assistant to the Dean of
Men. Twirlers are ﬁne, in an
organization such" as the Mt.

If Mr. Arthur would be.

Lebanon band, [but not at Pitt.”
Miss Patricia Ritz, assistant to
the Dean of Women, said, “If the
twirlers are down to the level of
a high schoolers, they won’t be good.

If the women are good

be an asset to Pitt."
Frank Carver, graduate man-

ager of athletics said, “The band

they Will

is pretty good as it is and I‘

wouldn’t want to guild the lilly.
I enjoy things as they are. Since
Pitt has the ﬁnest band in the
country, I can’t ﬁgure out how
twirlers would ﬁt in. All the hours
of work that band members put
in would be useless for the women
would distract from the musicians.
Our student body has always ‘con-
sidered the band very popular.”

“Pitt needs more recreational
activities, according to Miss Mar-
garet Covert, director of Women’s
physical edrucationvand advisor to
the women’s twirling corp. She
said, “The twirlers are just an
interest group getting together to
poll their’ talents. They under-
stand future plans are not deﬁn-
ite. This is just as good a-n activity
as any -other. I hope that in the
future the twirlers may help pro-.
mote school spirit and university
public relations.”

Surprises All In Day’s Work
For Two University Marshalls

Hedges Ed Berry

. Have Interesting

Time As Proctors

By NANCY JONES

Two guys who consider it
all in a day’s work to ﬁnd
themselves chasing _a mental
patient up and down the ele-
vators at Pitt, putting out ﬁres
in Comngons Room, or hunt-
ing for a corpse lost from the

Berry and Joseph Hedges, Uni-

Versity marshals.

“consists of anything that has

to do with student conduct,”

is often dull and routine, they
have both had many exciting ex-
periences in their ﬁve and seven
years, respectively, at the Univer-
sity. . , »

Less than three months ago a
woman walked into the Fifth Ave.
Information Office sobbing that
her husband was trying to make
her commit suicide. Then she
went down the halls, opened the
doors .of all..»-the Nationality rooms,
and peered inside. By the time
Berry and Hedges had been alerted
sh.) had boarded an elevator and
the quiet but intense chase began.

After ‘ futilely riding up and -

down the Skyscraper, and get-
, ting on and off on wrong floors,
the marshals caught sight of the
woman calmly leaving the build-
ing.
Berry, who is often humorously
called “Mr. Huckleberry,” or ‘-‘Mr.
Raspberry,” describes his job as

“babysitting.” He enjoys telling

about the “two lovers” he saw

walking arm-in-arm down the

hall. He followed them into an
empty classroom and there found
them embracing. ~

After a long lecture to the cou-
ple Berry concluded, “I’ve been

married‘ for 49 years and I wouldn't

think of doing such athing in pub-
lie.” The student reportedly re-

plied, “After 49 years I wouldn't

think of doing it either.”

called upon to put out ﬁres in the
Commons Room. Last year they
noticed that the top of the Com-
mons Room was ﬁlling with smoke.
Hedges frantically checked the
chimney ﬁues, while Berry search-
ed the Commons Room.
were trying to locate the ﬁre.
Finally someone noticed that a

in a rubbish basket in the ‘women’s
smoker and the wet towels were
smouldering.

«Another time Berry likes to
tell about is when he rushed up
to check on a student’s report
that there was a ﬁre in the Com-
mons Room. “There was,” he
said, “but it_was in the ﬁreplace.
And it wa.sn’t Apr. 1, either.”

Both marshals work 40 hours a

week. In addition they work for
special dances and University af-
fairs. Their headquarters is th
Information Office. -

Mistakes Stranger

Some’ humorous stories have
evolved around prominent mem-
bers of the administration. The
present chaplain’s oﬂice used to be
a math instructor's office. The in-

and told him’ that a “strange” man
had walked through his oﬂice and
into the adjoining Schenley room.
Berry decided to check. When he
opened the door, he saw that the
strange man was none other than
Chancellor Rufus H. Fitzgerald
who was rehearsing aspeech.

Series of Check.

Lists Published

Dr. Maurice J. Thomas, pro-

fessor of education at the Uni- ‘

Versity of Pittsburgh, recently
published a new book, “A Guide
for Action: Improving Public
Education through Citizen Partici-
pation”. The volume is available
at University Press or local book
stores. 3 , ‘

Dr. Thomas provides an instru-
ment by which members of a com-
munity may accomplish school
evaluation, the first step toward
improvement.

He also presents a series of
check lists by which ratings may

be established on every phase of

eduicvational program.

Check lists, when c-omplerted,
provide evaluation of finances,
teachers, secretarial and mainten-
ance workers, buildings, text-
and curriculum and a host
other factors which comprise the
school system.

The jovial Mr. Berry has many

stories up his sleeve. Sometime
ago he said he was standing by the

little boy came up and asked,
‘.‘Can you get meto the top of this

much prying, the boy explained, _

“You see, at exactly quarter to

ment -house in Wilkinsburg. And
I’m supposed to wave back.”

Berry continued about the spe-
cial tour he received in Alumni

marshal. “Apparently the pro-
fessor thought I was the father of
the two ‘Marshall’ boys in his

- children the » meaning of
‘words”;

By JOHN DeN_INNO
(Third of a Series)

WQED, 'Pittsburgh’s educa- '

tional television station, of-
fers an interesting variety of

programs that are not only V

entertaining but educational.

Many of these programs are .

staffed by Pitt students or faculty
members or both. All of these

people are volunteers, which are »

the backbone of education TV,
speciﬁcally WQED in Pittsburgh.
One of the programs, which is
comparatively new but which
has a large following, is Dr.
Benjamin Spock’s. He is pro-
fessor of child development at
Pitt and is recognized as one of
the I01) men in his ﬁeld. His
program titled “Parents and Dr.
Spock” is viewed on Tuesdays at
3 p.m. on WQED.
Accordingvto Mrs. John Ziegler,
PI‘0‘d11C€‘I‘, the program is meant

to be a spontaneous discussionoft

problems of a general nature con-
cerning children. Questions, which
have been sent in by the listening
audience, are discussed by Dr.
Spock and his guests. These guests
are all parents, usually with
children of the same age so that
they can discuss problems which
they have in common. '
“Children’s Corner”
Another. of ’WQED’s ‘ popular
shows is “Children’s Corner”. Its
popularity has increased to such

an extent that ‘it now receives on-

an average of 3000 letters per
week. The program’s aim is to

teach children without their real-.

izing that they are being taught.
It gives them constructive and
informative activities.

For example: a puppet named
King. Friday XIII teaches the
«big
another puppet name-d
Grandpere teaches them French;

Daniel S. Tiger attempts to instill I
“the tamer '

his philosophy that
things in life are the best”. The
voices for all of these puppets is
that of Fred Rogers, who is also
producer of the show. Most of the
behind-the—scenes work "for
“Children’s Corner” is done by
student volunteers from Pitt.

These volunteers set up the
scenes fo-r the program each day,
sort‘ and answer mail, and are
assistant producers. Star of the
show, which can be seen daily at
4 p.m., is Josie Carey. '

Caldwell Volunteers

Jack Caldwell, editor of Pitt’s
yearbook, The Owl, is a volunteer
at WQED. He directs live show
“Program Previews,” plus several

l.i'Hle Man On. Campus by Bibler

_"The pencil sharpener seems harder to crank since

. professor Snarf moved it up front."

M oriarit y Misguided

‘There was once a little boy named Moriarity.. Hepwas
born with no more than any other boy. His development

. was normal until he started to school. On, the basis of

such things as IQ exams and aptitude tests his elders all
‘came to the conclusion that Morty would be quite an asset
to the school some day. _

. But Morty got in with the wrong crowd. This crowd

' realized his capabilities and potentialities but decided to

channel them to their own beneﬁts. They were out for a

- good time and they used lVLorty’s- popularity as their spring

board. .
And so the» elders who had so patiently waited for

-Morty to develop into the kind of boy who would serve the

school were forced to watch as his potential service became '

a detriment. At last they. picked up gavels and passed
judgment. Morty was sent to reform school for an indeﬁnite

. term while his gang suffered the removal of their spring-

.-

 

olender, Sheila Gross, Thelma Jane King, Marilyn

board to good times. -

The people who had known Morty were sorry to see
him go because, even though he had thrown rocks at them
and called them ; names behind their _backs, they knew
that basically he was as ' good as, any other boy and better
than most. They knew that his potential was great.

His potential is still curbed since he remains in reform
school. There he is shut off from the people under whose
inﬂuence he might develop along the lines which his elders
so desired. ~ ~' -

, ‘ Some have left the school since Morty was sent away,
others have been enrolled. To them he is only a dim
memory or a specter of whom the upperclassmen speak oc-
casionally. But those of us who were here before Morty

went completely off his trolley remember him because _

of his odd nickname. We used to call him panther.

  Debaitable Opponents J

duces7 himself, and immediately instills an air-0!‘

By Jim Deweese

One of the surest although by no means newest
ways to become an accomplished paranoid is to
engage in the art of verbal skull cracking which
masquerades ‘under the innocent guise of college
debating. _ . ,/

It’s not the debate itself which accounts for the
withdrawal, but rather the opponents which the
debater must meet in the course
of a contest. Let's look brieﬂy
at the three major types of op-
ponents. V -

Our ﬁrst opponent is the liter-
ary debater. As he steps to the
rostrum we are struck by his
neat appearance as well as by
a 12 inch lead pipe wielded by
his partner. As he‘ reaches the
lecturn he places upon its polish-
ed surface a dictionary, a Thesaurus, a current
world atlas, the last three volumes of the Con-
gessional Record, and John Foster Dulles.

Speak Boy! .

He seems incapable of uttering words of less
than ﬁve syllables. We. usually spend the last
eight minutes of his talk trying to decipher what
he said during the ﬁrst two. '

The reasoner, suave, edebonair, and smiling, is
our second opponent. He enters the room, intro‘-

 

g

security. During our speech he takes occasional
notes and, after each notation, smiles at us and
nods as if ihdicating complete agreement.

Then he places his tooth brush on the lecturn

and begins. He praises us, the judge, the audi-

ence, the judge, the building, the judge, and John
Foster Dulles who our literary friend neglected to

‘ removefrom the lecturn. He invariably _wins the

debate.
Si-ric'|'|y An Upset

By the time that we arrive for our third de-
bate we are in no shape to meet anyone, much
less our next opponent, the emotional type. We
are upset by his common appearance and by his
partner whose extended left leg we failed to note
on. our way into the room.

As our opponent stalks to the lecturn we note
for ‘the ﬁrst time his calloused ﬁsts. As he talks,

we feel a lump in our throats. Tears stream down»

our quivering chins as we note his soggy shirt
front. Our heads hang in shame as he pounds
righteously upon the table. We break down com-
pletely as he stoops to lift John Foster -Dulles back

‘to the splintered top of the lecturn.

As we turn oursalty gazelupon the judge we
ﬁnd him blubbering uncontrolably into his score
sheet. We have no recourse but to concede. He
should ‘have used water proof ink.

Freshmen Dance Well

By Irv Ro-I-hman
Oscar Wilde wrote that “To
get into the best society nowa-
days, one has either to feed peo-

ple, amuse people, or to shock

people.” Elite students gather at
the tuckshops where meals serve
as sufficient substitution for food.
And city newspa ershave pun-

are buying papers for no other ,

reason than to ﬁnd’ out what's
been startling themselves, lately.

But as far as amusement is
concerned, I’ll go along with
plans of freshman class officers.
The ﬁrst freshman-sponsored,

Friday night, can’ be written
down as a top-notch social suc-
cess. Enthusiasm was high at

. Some interest seems to have
been stirred up by the announce-

pages the other day concerning

It’s the kind
of thing that

Bu_t we think it goes a little
farther than _that here at Pitt.
Year in and ‘year out, that won-
derful 120 piece Varsity March-
ing Band has represented the
University all over the country,
and justly earned its reputation
as one of the nation’s finest,
Bands are for marching, and
Playing band music, and a
marching, music-playing organi-
zation, to be any good, should be
made _up of men.

Gleasonly Chorus Girls

We've always felt. a little ill
at ease when those high school
bands come along with their ver-
sion of the June Taylor chorus
line, prancing about energetic-
ally, seldom- in -unison, to the
tune of the Washington Post
March, or whatever they prance
to. It gives the kids an outlet
for their nervous,-energy, so to
speak. And isn’t high school just
the place for letting out nervous
energy? The average high school
fronts a,’ bevy of 5 to 15 cuties,
letting off energy out of tune, as
it were, which is bad enough.

   

the restof their college days, the
Class of ’58 should show old
timers new twists.

High Hoppers ..
‘Couples hopped high during
the Bunny Hop, and few Mexi-
can jumping beans could have

looked lovelier during the “Hat” T

dance. A tight “Hokey-Pokey”
circle provided more than enough
fun as rumps bumped, elbows
elbowed, and feet fumbled.

The grand march near the end
of the evening produced an im-
pressive oddity as a hundred
couples trooped around pillars
and across the dance hall in
two’s, four’s, and eight’s.

Benny Benack was heard to
-say that it was one of the few
times the march has been com-
pleted. Must have been well-
trained ROTC cadets in the lines.

We don’t think we’re alone in
thinking that the proposed wom-

ciety isn’t a good idea. Women
just aren’t made for that sort of
thing. Bare knees, short skirts,
giggles and dropped batons don’t

E.O.G.T.T.T.S.F. means “Ele-
vators only go to the thirty-sixth
floor.”‘ The rhubarb it raised be-
fore the dance lasted afterwards,
as students debated whether they
did stop at only one level. Some-
times, I feel they do. (Pardon
me, Tommy, I couldn’t r_esist.) ,

It would be folly to cite one
or two persons for outstanding
efforts. The best part of the
dance was _ that a great many
frosh put in extra hours on com-
mittees to prepare for the_occa-
sion.. . '

The Class of ’58 set a thrilling
precedent. We hope it turns into
a freshman. tradition. W

Experience Not Enough

It is our considered opinion
that agroup of 50 young ladies,
with or without’ ‘experience,
would never be able to obtain

the perfection necessary to put

them on a plane with the Pitt
band.. And if they; couldn’t
achieve that plane, why don”:
they leave their batons back in
high school and leave the march-
ing to the men, where it belongs.

 

Letters to

Twirlerslf” Frosh Praised

Editor:

Judging from the comment c_i—r-.
culating throughout the Cathe-
dral, ‘I assume that many are not
well informed on the organiza-
tion and purpose of the‘Twirling
Corps and that the comment
passed is done so purely for the
sake of talking. _

Some think that the Twirling
Corps will be part of the band—
it deﬁnitely will not be!

Some feel that it would detract
from the Varsity Marching Band.

Now if the band is what we coh- B,

sider it to be—the best band in
the nation, why should anybody
feel that the Twirling _Corps
would. stealfthe thunder from
such . a tremendous group? I
should think it would add more
color to the events in which it
participated. ,
Furthermore, the Twirling
Corps will offer Pitt women more

opportunity to take part in inter- .

collegiate activities.

Why shoultl the response to

any progressive ideas and moves
here at Pitt be negative? Why
so much pessimism? If these
people with the “no”_ attitude
would drop out of schooland let‘
the freshmen- set the pace, Pitt

’rhe Editor- l

would be 100% better.

Hats off to Larry‘Cervi and
Maxine Carney for promoting the
Twirling Corps!

Bus. Ad. ’55

Editor’s note.‘ Come now Pat,
if freshmen set the pace Pitt
would not only The a high build-
ing but also a high school, all
due respect to freshmen am-
bitions. 

Band Wantsl No -Antics

Editor:

As members of the Pitt ~’Vars_ity
Marching Band‘ our chief con-
cern is for the attainment of a
top ‘level of precision . in both
music and drill. The men want
no horseplay or “College-Joe”
antics in rehearsal. The integra-
tion of women into the band per-
formance offers an opportunity
for the band to degenerate into a
social function. We dognot want
this! Let’s preserve our rehear-

- sals as sessions of serious prac-

tice and teamwork and save Sat-
urday night for the women.‘

THE’ TREEHOUSE OF THE AUGUST MOON

Spring is just around the corner, and with spring, as always,
will come tree-sitting contests. ‘This I applaud. Tree-sitting‘ his

healthful and jolly and as American as apple pie. Also it keeps‘

you off the streets. V A .-
Tree-sitting is not, however, without its hazards, as you will

presently see when I tell you the dread and chilling tale of

Manuel Sigafoos and Ed Pancreas. '

- Manuel and Ed, friends and room-mates, were walking one day

past the folk music room in the School of Dentistry and Fine
Arts. Suddenly they stopped, for coming through the door of
the folk music room was a clear and thrilling alto voice singing

the lovely folk tune, I Strtmgled My True-Love with.He"r Own X

Yellow Braids, and I ’ll N ever Eat Her Sorghum Any More.
When the last shimmering notes of the ballad had died away,
Manuel and Ed rushed into the room, and there they thought
their swelling hearts must burst asunder. For the singer was as
beautiful as the song! Fair as the morn she was, doe-eyed and
curvilinear. 7 g i ‘ I
“My name is Manuel Sigafoos,” cried Manuel Sigafoos, “and
I love you madly, wildly, tempestuouslyl” ‘
. “My name is Ed Pancreas,” cried Ed Pancreas, “and I love
you more _than Manuel Sigafoos.” . a
“My name. is Ursula Thing,” cried the girl, “and ‘I’ve got
a jim-dandy idea. Why don’t you two have a contest, and I will
go steady with thewinner?”
“What kindof contest?” cried Manuel and Ed.
“A tree-sitting contest,” cried Ursula Thing. “Natch!”
"‘Done and done,” cried Manuel and Ed, and they"clambered
up adjoining aspens, taking with them the following necessaries:

food, water, clothing,-medicaments, bedding, reading matter, ,

and.- most essential of all - plenty of Philip Morris cigarettes.

. We who live on the ground, with all the attendant advan-
tages,.know how important Philip Morris cigarettes are. Think,
then, how much more important they must be to the lonely tree
dweller — how much more welcome their vintage tobaccos, ‘how
much more soothing their mild pure ﬂavor, how much more
comforting to know as one sits in leafy solitude that come wind
or weather, come light or dark, Philip Morris will always remain
the same dependable, reliable, ﬂavorful friend.

,,Well supplied with Philip Morris, our heroes began their contest

— Manuel with good heart, Ed with evil cunning. Theishocking

fact is thvat,Ed intended to win the contest with a Machiavellian‘
ruse. It ‘seems that Ed, quite unbeknownst to Manuel, was one

of three identical triplets. Each. night while Manuel dozed on
his bough, one of Ed’s brothers —-Fred or Jed-would sneak
up the tree and replace him. Thus Ed was spending only one-third
as much time in the tree as Manuel. “How can I lose?” said Ed
with a crafty giggle to hisbrother Fred or J ed.
a But Ed had a surprise coming. "For Manuel, though he did not

-know it himself, was a druid! He had been abandoned as an

infantat the hut of a. poor and humble woodcutter named
Winthrop Mayhew Sigafoos, who had raised the child as his own.

- So when Manuel got into the tree, he found to his surprise that

he’d never feltso at home and happy in his life, and he had

.. absolutely no intention of ever leaving.

After four or ﬁve years Ed and his brothers wearied of the

j contest and conceded. Ursula Thing came to Manue1’s tree and
called him to come down and pin her. He declined. Instead he

asked her to jointhim in the tree.,.. This she could not do, being‘
subject to acromegaly" (a morbid allergy to woodpeckers) so
she ended up with Ed after all. ‘ a

Only she made a mistake -— a very natural mistake. It was
Jed she ended up with, not Ed. '

Ed, heartbrokenat being tricked by his -own brother, took

Geneva Court Pa

Lehigh Edges
Matmen, 

Both Pitt and Lehigh won foui
matches at the Memorial Field
House last Saturday but the only
fall of the night proved to be the
deciding factor as Coach Rex
Peery’s matmen bowed to Lehigh’s
Engineers, 14-12. A

The Peerymen were leading 12
9 going into the heavyweight con
(test, and only a fall could keep
them from at least scoring a draw.
Unfortunately that’s just what
happened at 1:10 of the third
period when Werner Seel pinned

’Dan Wisniewski with a body press

and arm bar to give the Engineers
the victory,

Bill Hulings and Ed Peery got
the locals off to a fast start in
the 123 and 130-pound classes
respectively by decisioning their-
opponents rather handily. Hul-
'-igs outmaneuvered Steve Wi--
‘socker to win 7-0 and Peery
took his second straight decision
of the campaign as he overpow-

' cred Parker Mangus, 8-1. '

But the Blue and Gold fOUI'lk:
their next three opponents not
too cooperative. Dave Bates (137)
defeated Nick Swentosky (137),
6-1, Ken Faust (147) won over
Bob Cook (147), 6-2, and Ed Eich-
elberger-—second place finisher in

"the NCAA’s last year—took the

measure-. of Don Huff (157), in a
fast moving bout, 12-5.

7 In. the 1673- pound division, junior
Ed DeWitt of Washington outfoxed

, Roger Taylor, 5-0, and 177-pound

Joe Solomon had a troublesome
time on his hands before edging
Dave Gallaher, 5-3.

1 Two falls, by Bob Richardson
helped the

. an impressive 21-10 win in their

Vfirst outing over the visiting
1 Engineers.

the first period.

Fresh Out To Break
Geneva Jinx Tonight

Tonight the Panther freshman squad will be trying” to

break an old jinx when they tangle with the Geneva Froslr

at the Beaver Falls High School Gym. '

Although the’Cubs had little trouble putting away the

Covie freshmen when the teams met at the Field House, the

Pittites haven’t been able to win an away game against _
‘Geneva for the last ﬁve years. Last year the Panther Cubs
trounced the Covies 94-68 at the? A

Field House only to, suffer an
83-71 setback when'the Geneva
squad was in the friendly atmos-
phere of their home court. ,

Earlier this season the Frosh
whipped the.Covie juniors 68-53
but as in the past, -when the
squads meet tonight it might be
a different story. Coach Carl
Peterson feels, however, ‘that
with the incentive of an un-
beaten season ‘to spur them on,
the Cubs should be successful in
their attemtp to break the Gen-
eva jinx. '

In previous games at Geneva,
for‘ some reason, the freshmen
first-stringers have been fouling
out .after‘c0mpiling early leads.
If the key men don’t leave the

game on fouls tonight, the Pan-

thers are expected to pick up
their tenth win of the season.
Besides being the tenth ‘(vic-
tory this year, a win tonight will
make thirteen straight for the
Frosh since they took the last
three of last season’s schedule.

Riflers Grab First
In Pgh. League

Last Friday night at the Stad-
ium range, the Panthers copped
their ﬁrst Greater Pittsburgh Riﬂe
League match by downing Car-
negie Tech 1349-13915.

High man for‘ the Pittites was

of 276. His performance was not
the top one of the evening, though.
That honor went to Bill Kerr of
Carnegie Tech who ﬁred a 278 in
the Tartanls’ losing effort. Follow-
ing Sheppard in the scoring col-
umn for the locals were James
Cleary with a 272, Richard

— Greene, David Jacobson, and Tom

Claric, all with 276’s.

This win, the third in a row
over Tech in a two year period,
has elevated the Panthers into a

second place tie with Duquesne.

Injuries Also Pop Up 7
' For Covie   Trip Tonight

‘By GENE AROMATORIO .

When a team loses on its own court, that team doesnft
ﬁgureto beat its conquerors away from home. And this is
especially true when the foreign court is small.

, So, when the Panthers travel to Beaver Falls tonight to
meet Geneva’s Covenentors, the Covies should ru‘le asslight

favorites since they dumped the locals at the Field’House,

91-67, earlier this season.
It’s a pretty good bet, though,
.that Coach Bob Timmons’ hoop-
Esters won’t be paying much at-
:tention to the form sheet since
(they will be to busy looking for
‘revenge against the Beaver
Valley cagers.
; Injuries Bothersome
E One thing besides Geneva that
could hurt the Panthers tonight
will be an old nemisis to all bas-
ketball teams-—injuries. r When
the Panthers leave Ellsworth

The major injury which will
\be worrying Timmons, however,
jis the bad hip bruise sufferedby
‘ Captain Ed Pavlick in last week-
end’s tilt with Penn State. The
6-2 forward was hurt early in
the first quarter when ‘ he fell
hard after driving in for a layup.

A couple of other injuries
which are bothering the Blue
and Gold are the pulled leg mus-
cles suffered by regular Joe Fen-
wick and sub Darrell Lewis.
Fenwick’s seems the more seri-
ous of the two and as a result
the Brownsville hoopster’s speed
has been considerably cut down.

line coaching jobs.

Tomlinson, who played oﬁensive
right guard, under Michelosen, for
the Steelers in 1949, 50, and 51, is
currently the line tutor at the Uni-
versity of Denver and only two
weeks ago-the former Kansas Uni-
versity star was in Pittsburgh to
recruit football talent.

A strong point in Tomlinson’s
favor, beside his having played un-
der Michelosen, is the fact that he
is well acquainted with the T for-
mation--the type of offense used
at Denver and also the style which
Michelosen plans to use. «

When Michelosen was contacted
about this .rumor he refused to
give any comment on it. He’ did
indicate, though, that he is about
ready to formally select his as-
sistants. The new head tutor com-
mented, “We expect to have some-
thing by the end of the mouth.”

What he will have decided by
the end of the month is not cer-
tain but there are strong indica-
tions that an ex-pro gridderor two

couple of weeks ago the name of
former Steeler Val Jansante was
circulating quite a bit.

IA Letter For
The Big Boys

By DAVE _MAZER
Sports Editor

 

Open letter to the big boys:
Dear Paciﬁc Coast Conference, Big Ten and Notre Dame,

It seems that the present plan of football television, which
has the Game-of-the Week, is not in accordance with your ideas.

This plan, which permits 13 games to be televised in the dif-
ferent geographical regions of the country with no school being
televised twice, is directly opposite to your views because you’re
not gaining enough beneﬁts from it.

Well, Mr. Big Men, sit down awhile and listen to reason.
As everyone know, television involves big money and you fel-
lows have been getting more than your allotted share while many
other schools have been suffering. , '

How? The NCAA in order to maintain good public interest in
their present plan has had eleven teams as repeaters since the plan
went into operation two years ago. i \

And seven of these eleven repeaters come from the .-PCC, Big
Ten, and Notre Dame. Now, you want even more and are not helping
the NCAA by telling them that they better come around to your way
of thinking or else, count me out.

Your latest demand, made by the PCC, says you will “secede
from the union,” or in other words, not participate with the
National Collegiate Athletic Association if that group passes the
present plan of the Game-of-the-Week again. '

What kind of business is this? You'd think the television com-
mittee was not cognizant of the fact that the Game-of-the-Week
isn’t the best plan. They know what’s coming off and if any-
thing better can be derived at without hurting the many other smaller

‘ colleges, it will be done. «

By smaller schools, I don’t mean Bethany, Geneva, or the similar,
but ‘colleges that play Class A football and areseen occasionally on
the national network. .

Don’t youthink that Pitt, also a major university, wants more

I too but is letting the NCAA provide the answer to this cornplexing
. problem? ‘

. As Frank Carver, Pitt’s Graduate Manager of Athletics
says, “We’re satisﬁed with the present situation because nothing
else can’ be done. But, we're not completely satisﬁed because
we’re not sure whether we’re gaining or losing.”

Figures show that the Panther’s attendance increased this fall
but without TV every Saturday, isn’t there the possibility that even
more fans would have ﬂocked to, the Stadium?

I’m not trying to point out Pitt as being lily white, but we’re.
just as much involved as you are. s all wish‘you’d be more patient
with the NCAA because while the present plan is not the most suit-_

able, it is best for most colleges at

this time.

Frosh Fin Stars A
Lead Canton Win

led by Tony Tresser and Gene
Adams, two former scholastic All-
Americans, the undefeated frosh
swimmers crushed Canton-Mc-
Kinley 52-25 at Canton, Friday
afternoon.

The fresh took firsts in seven
of the nine events, ‘with new
records being set in three of them.

Tresser set a new pool mark in
the individual medley with a time
of 1:l6.6. The old standard in this
event was 1117.5.

Not to be outdone, tihougvh,
Ada-ms quickly set a pool record
in the 100-yard breaststroke with
a time of l:02.2.

The third new record was set
by Lou Durbin, Adams, and Don
Weber in the medley relay as
their time of 1:39.5 knocked more
than ten_ seconds off the old stand-
by of 1:150.

Other victors included Weber
in the backstroke and Durbinv in
the 100-yard freestyle. Once again _
Milo Fisher outclassed the op-
position to take the fancy diving.

An interesting sideligh-t to the
meet was the performance turned
in by freshman. Ed Robson who
took two seconds. His times were
good, that is, good enough to win
most meets. 'But in the Canton
meet, Robson had to settle for
second place because the ﬁrsts
were taken by Adams and Tresser
with their record-breaking per-
formances.

By BERNIE MORRIS e

Every team has its unsung
heroes and the Panther’s un-
defeated f r e s h In a n basketball
quintet is no exception.

Probably the most unsung mem-
ber and yet one of its best all-
around stars is Bill “Dilly” Dillon,
6-3, 190-pound performer from
Derry Boro.

Noted chiefly for his one-hand
push shot, Dillon is one of those

rare ballplayers who seem to do
everything well. He is a cracker-
jack playmaker and has sparkled
consistently on defense.

Dillon was held in such high.

esteem by his teammates that he
was awarded the honor of being
selected as captain of this year’s
squad.

Coach Carl Peterson said of
Dillon, “He’s a boy with a wonder-
ful attitude and along with it he
has the determination and savvy
that will enable him to make the
grade.”

Dillon played three years of
varsity ball at Derry Boro, a small
high school near Latrobe. There
he helped spark the school to the
Westmoreland county champion-
ship in his senior year.

Not being content to stick just
to basketb-all in high school, Dillon
