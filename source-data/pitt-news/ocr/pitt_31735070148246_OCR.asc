“I was a sophomore in high

“I wanted to join the ﬁre depart-

The National Fallen Fireﬁght-

after the time the first plane

stahl said. “We are going to run
up those stairs today knowing
that we are going to come out,
and as we do it, we’ll remember
what the morning was like and
make sure that we never for-
get.” '

As the ﬁreﬁghters prepared
to enter the building, a crowd
of about 50 people gathered at
the Cathedral and clapped for

the climbers in encouragement. '

The ﬁreﬁghters ran in groups
of ﬁve up the staircase on the
Belleﬁeld Avenue side.

About a half an hour after
they began, a sweaty Ravenstahl
emerged from the Cathedral and
reflected on how difﬁcult a job
the ﬁreﬁghters of 9/11 faced, es-
pecially with all of their equip-

~ ment on and the chaos surround-

ing them.

The participants received a
photo and badge of one of the
fallen heroes of Sept. 11, and the
money collected from the $25
registration fee went to assist
surviving families and cowork-

ers of those ﬁreﬁghters who died
on 9/11. .
“We remember the lives that
so many gave that day, whether
they were ﬁreﬁghters, paramed-
ics, police ofﬁcers or even ordi-

‘ nary citizens from New York or_

across the country; Washington,
D.C., [and] of course, closer to
home — Shanksville, Pennsylva-
nia,” Ravenstahl said‘. “It is trag-
ic, and it is painful, but we must
remember. We—m'ust appreciate
and thank those first respond-
ers who gave so much  on that
horriﬁc, horriﬁc day. It was a day
that changed America, and we
will never forget the sacriﬁces
that so many made.

Ravenstahl said that every-
one needs to be prepared for an
event like 9/11 and championed
the ﬁrst responders for the indi-
vidual and team effort they put
in each and every day.

“You never know when Sept. «

11 is going to come again. You
never know when that ﬁre is go-
ing to break out; when you’re

day. So we remember it today in
a special way and a speciﬁc way,
but we alsoneed to recognize
that these men and women do
this on a dailylbasis for us.”

‘ It was clear that the ﬁreﬁght-
ers making the commemorative
climb were humbled to do so. Vir-
tually all of the participants used
the word “honor” when speaking
about the task they were prepar-
ing tocomplete.

' Ryne Rutkowski, a Stancliff
Hose ﬁreman, likewise echoed
the sentiment.

“I feel good honoring them
the right way. I’ve got the wings of
angels helping me up the stairs,”
Rutkowski said. “It’s important
because we are honoring the ﬁre-
ﬁghters for the sacriﬁces they
made, but we are also honoring‘
the civilians that died, not just in
New York, but in Pennsylvania
and D.C. as well.” I

9/ 11 inspires Pitt student to enlist in ROTC

Gretchen Andersen
Staﬂ” Writer

On aTuesday morning Seth Kerrwas
sitting in Mr. Myer’s sixth grade math
class when another teacher inter-
rupted to speak with Mr. Myer.

After a few mumblings, Kerr’s
teacher, Mr. Myer, turned on the
television. And that’s when Kerr
saw an airplane hit the World Trade
Center.

Ten years later, the Pitt senior in
Army ROTC, Three Rivers Battal-
ion, will soon graduate and become
a second lieutenant in the U.S. Army
with an eight-year commitment,
leading a platoon of about 42 men
and women. ’

l Kerr is one of about 3,800 Army
ROTC cadets exchanging an educa-

tion for military service. For Kerr,
9/1_1 played a large role in his decision
to enlist in ROTC.

“Had 9/ 11 not happened, maybe
I would not have been in the Army,”
Kerr, a political science major, said.
“But I know what kind of role I want
in order to ﬁt in this world. I didn’t
want that 9-to-5 job. Iwanted aplace
I could implement change and make
an impact. I’m a proactive person.”

Kerr said that while growing up,
he had always had a respect for vet-
erans and those in the military — his
father served in the Air Force during
the Korean War. But the thought of
joining the military didn’t cross his
mind until he was a junior in high
school. Kerr, who focused on school
work and played basketball, origi-
nally had other things in mind.

“When I tell people now what I

maybe I would not have

do, they are shocked that I’m in

the military,” Kerr said. “I didn’t like
to be toldwhat to do, I didn’t like au-
thority, especially duringhigh school.

Had 9/ l I not happened, A  

So I think it is funny for people
to hear I’m entering a profession that
prides itself on authority.”

When his father suggested he '

join the Air Force ROTC during high
school, Kerr went for an interview

with the organizers of the ROTC pro- »

gram at Penn State. But after hear-
ing the Air Force was looking, for

students studying technology and A‘
1 science, Kerr — who had an interest

in international relations — decided
against entering the branch.

Soon after, an Army recruiter
called, asking Kerr if he wanted to

enlist. About to start his senior year -

of high school, he told the recruiter

about his plans to enroll in college.

The recruiter mentioned the beneﬁts

of an ROTC scholarship —— which A

covers tuition, ‘book fees and in-
cludes a monthly stipend ——- and

After graduating high school, he left for 4

basic combat training at Fort Benning, Ga. Kerr

‘ said the nine weeks spent awayfrom family and

friends served as a growing period for him.
“I had never been away from home for that
long of a period, and you can’t really talk to

people back home. It’s more of a minute con- _

versation to call home and tell them you are
alive and well,” Kerr said.

After completing the training, Kerr attend:
ed Lock Haven University and did Army ROTC
there for one semester before transferring to
Pitt injanuary 2009. After Kerr graduates, he
will be commissioned to an active—duty unit
in May 2012.

As the Battalion S-3 operations officer, Kerr
is responsible for training the entire battalion
— about 250 cadets from three different states
and many universities. His primary purpose
is to plan, implement and supervise training

Cadet Peter Hokrein, the Three Rivers
Battalion commander and a second—year
grad student at Pitt’s Graduate School of Pub-
lic and International Affairs, ﬁrst met Kerr
when Hokrein entered the ROTC program
last year.

Hokrein said in an email that Kerr spends
a lot of his free time working on ROTC events,
such as planning white-water rafting trips.

“You will never see him standing around
while others are doing the work. If there is
something that needs to be done, he takes
initiative. He is highly motivated and pushes
himself and others at PT (physical training). .
His PT uniform is pretty gross, which means
he gives 100 percent,” Hokrein said.

Sunday’s ceremony came on the sec
0nd of two days of honoring the new $52
million Flight 93 National Memorial. The
only National Park illustrating the history
of Sept. 11, it will include more features

_ in the coming years, including a Visitor

center, which will require an additional
$10 million to construct.

Ground Zero and the Pentagon also
had memorial services Sunday honoring
the victims of the terrorist attacks. Other

small memorial services were scattered
around the country to honor those who
died on 9/11. Obama also paid his respects

Saturday at the Arlington National Cem- '

etery.

Gov. Tom_Corbett began the remarks
of the day in Shanksville. He said that
throughout the past 10 years, the crash
of Flight 93 has been compared to the
Battle of Gettysburg and the battle at the

Alamo. But he said that there is no true.

comparison for the passenger uprising

of Flight 93.

“The passengers of Flight 93 charted a
new course, set a new standard for Ameri-
can bravery,” Corbett said. “They did not
choose to go into battle when they boarded
that jetliner.” '

Flight 93’s passengers and crew were
killed_1O years ago while trying to prevent

. hijackers from using the plane to crash

into the White House or U.S. Capitol build-
ing. Less than an hour before the crash in

the Pentagon.

Corbett spoke of passenger Honor
Elizabeth Wainio, 27, who spoke on the
phone with her stepmother before storm-
ing the pilot cabin. .

“It hurts.me that it’s going to be so
much harder for you all than it is for me,”
Wainio had said over the phone.

Corbett said that “nothing we build
with stone and mortar can sufﬁciently
honor the deeds” of the passengers and
crew of Flight 93. _

U.S. Rep. Bill Shuster, R—Chambersburg,
said that the horrific events and heroism
that followed should never be forgotten,
and that the heroic actions of 40 people

Y would serve as an inspiration for future

generations. p

_ Former Gov. Tom Ridge, who was in
ofﬁce during the terrorist attacks and was
later named the nation’s first secretary of
Homeland Security, held back tears before
beginning his speech.

“Americans do not live in fear, they live
in freedom, and they will never let that
go,” said Ridge, who serves as a co—chair
of the Flight 93 Memorial. “America is, and
always will be, a resilient nation.” -

At noon, President Barack Obama ar-
rived, laying a wreath at the center of the
Wall of Names. He stayed to shake hands
and speak with several of the family mem-
bers of the victims. Chants of “USA! USA!”
echoed in the field. '

Claudia Kelly, 61, of Logansport, Ind.,
said that visiting the site feltlike some-
thing she owed the country.

“I felt like I had to come,” Kelly said.
“These people ‘made such a sacriﬁce.”

At the conclusion of the ceremony, after '

Obama departed‘ to visit the crash site at
the Pentagon, the public was permitted to
view the Wall of Names. People who had

. never met the men and women aboard the

plane walked slowly down the path, plac-
ing items at the feet of the slabs.

]oAnn Saam, 50, of Newport, Pa., had
previously never had the chance to visit
the site, but she promised herself that
she wouldn’t miss the event’s 10th an-
niversary. She placed at the memorial a
ﬂower for each person — red carnations
for the women, purple carnations for the
men and a white carnation for the one
unborn child. '

“I want to honor the people that died
for us,” Saam said, while “Taps” started
to play softly in the background. I

ROTC training a daily routine for Pitt student

ROTC< 3

a.m. every morning Monday through Thursday
for physical training, when Kerr and the other
60 ROTC cadets run at least two miles and
complete core and upper body calisthenics.

Kerr said they are taught by the “best of the
best,” referring to the cadre that helps teach
the cadets. These are both active—duty sol-
diers and ofﬁcers who are pursuing a degree.
Military Science fourth years, who are in their
last year of the ROTC program, also assist the
cadre during the exercises.

One common exercise involves the Cathe-
dral of Learning — cadets will run up,. down
and then up again all 36 ﬂights of stairs.

On Fridays, they substitute exercise for
ediﬁcation with a Leadership Lab. The class
focuses on skills such as how to conduct a raid
or an ambush from 6:30 am. to 8:30 a.m.

Cadet Hannah Baker of Battalion S-1 said
Kerr, her close friend, is one of the most de-
termined and sincere people she has ever
known. They met as freshmen, when Baker
was nervously starting one of her ﬁrst days of
physical training. ’ ~

“I was the new kid and everyone was bud-
died up. Iwas looking around — and although
it might not seem like a big deal — he just
turned around and asked if I had a partner. It
really meant a lot,” Baker said.

EDITORIAL

Anti-depression ‘
resources critical    

The Pitt community needs to have
a little talk. _

Suicide is a difficult topic. Some
of us have lost loved ones to sui-
cide. Someof us have considered
it ourselves. And even still, some
of us are too scared, ashamed
or upset to talk about it. But we
think it’s something that cannot
be ignored.

Sept. 10 was National Suicide
Prevention Day, and last week
was National Suicide Prevention
Week. We think it’s great that such
a pervasive yet stigmatized topic
receives national attention. How-
ever, we think the idea of helping
those who are considering taking
their own lives should last more

‘ than just a few days. Especially

at colleges.

Thankfully, Pitt does too.

At the class of 2015’s orienta-
tion, some of Pitt’s student—ath—
letes appeared in a public service
announcement that stressed the
importance of talking about the
most common mental-health issue
on our campus: depression. We
think the University is pointing
new students in the right direction
—— there is no shame in talking
about depression. “Talking about
it” seems to be a theme here.

Pitt’s “Give Depression 21 Voice
 Talk About It” campaign focuses
on reducing the stigma attached.
to depression, especially stress-
ing that there should be no shame
associated with the illness. We
agree. Students need to let go of
the inhibitions that prevent them

from getting help.

According to Psych Central,
an online mental health network
run by professionals in the ﬁeld,
44 percent of college students in
the United States report feeling
depression symptoms. One out
of every_four college students or
adults has a diagnosable mental
illness.

I Active Minds, another mental-
health awareness group at Pitt,
organized an event last April
called “Send Silence Packing.”
The exhibit featured a spread of
1,100 unattended backpacks that

‘ represented the number of sui-

cides involving college students
each year.

There’s no reason to be alone.
And We’re not alone. We’re part
of a community that has suffered
through multiple suicides in the
past couple of years. We get it.
Pitt gets it. If you’re not feeling
like yourself, then there are many
resources you can turn to.

The Counseling Center spe-
cializes in mental health, and
it could be a great resource for
students_ who feel overworked,
overwhelmed or homesick.

Rather than the few days of
national observance the country
officially designates for suicide
prevention, we think it should
be a year—round concern. Look
out for yourself and others, and

don’t be afraid to get help. Our

community has lost too many of
its own already — let’s just talk
about it. Q

LETTER TO THE EDITOR

To the Editor, »

I would have liked to attend the
Sept. 11 memorial event held at
‘Soldiers & Sailors. But this year I
settled for a moment of silence in
my dorm room instead. The ser-
vice at Soldiers & Sailors included a
prayer — something that alienates
those with differing or no religious
affiliations: The intent of the me-
morial is to remember the fallen.
The victims of the attacks were cer-
tainly not limited to Christians, so
why should only the Christians be
represented?

I am by no means suggesting
that religion be censored, but
merely excluded from something
that people of diverse religious
affiliations would like to partici-
pate in. To keep things fair, you
would need a representative of
every faith, which isn’t practical.
Although religion is a vital com-
ponent of many people’s lives, it
should not be associated with a
service open to the public.

THE SCHAFFIDAVIT

Fear and political op

Matt Schaff
Columnist

Here’s the best 9/11 lesson out there:
If it happens again, don’t let fear be-
tray you. V

Anyone watching the lead-up to
Sunday’s 9/11 anniversary witnessed
an army of media personnel scram-
bling to squeeze meaning out of that
senseless day when nearly 3,000
people lost their lives. In TV spe-
cials and editorials, lessons of vari-
ous forms were offered and “never
forget” messages were tossed about.
Even The Pitt News editorial page
joined the chorus, encouraging us
last week to somehow “protract the
disaster’s signiﬁcance.”

These appeals have an audience
for a reason. When faced with re-
alities that shake our foundations
-- for example, if frequently taken-
for—granted staples like basic secu-
rity are questioned — we naturally
welcome any opportunity to muffle
unresolved internal dissonance to
soothe our uneasiness. Mass media
“lesson plans” that condense 9/11’s
nuances into one neat package of
meaning provide that closure op-
portunity.

But before too many Pitt stu-
dents make their ﬁnal judgments,
and before 9/11 indeed risks being
forgotten, I have to stick a foot in
the door, at least for my generation’s
sake. I must join the ranks of these
journalistic pedagogues because, in

- my view, most media outlets have -

largely missedv9/11’s most valuable
lesson: Fear, not terrorists, can be a
country’s greatest enemy.

' At its heart, the country’s fear
response to 9/11 consisted of ﬂag-
rallying and an overwhelmingly
uncritical attitude of its president.
All this made for a U.S. population
unacceptably vulnerable to exploita-
tion, and that’s just what happened.
Unbridled fear allowed the Bush ad-

ministration to use 9/ 11 for political
gain on multiple levels, exact enor- '

mous costs on therest ofus and get
away with it in the end. Just as we

I should treat a large-scale attack on

U.S. soil, nothing of this sort should
ever be allowed to happen again.
You can probably guess I’m talk-
ing mostly about Iraq. After nearly a
decade of Middle Eastern wars, the
picture is clear: Invading Iraq was
a Bush agenda item long before the
towers fell. When political opportu-
nity struck, the Bush administration
bent the truth — and intelligence
officials’ arms — to connect Saddam
Hussein with 9/11 and weapons of

mass destruction. And then, most _

signiﬁcantly, the public went along
with the puppet show.

It wasn’t like 9/11 suddenly con-
vinced the Bushies that Saddam’s
government in particular was some-

looked upon the Fertile Crescent with
a special longing after George H.W.
Bush decided in 1991 not to make the
Gulf War about more than Kuwait,
even whenan all-out invasion of Iraq

_ could have commanded popular sup-
port. But a 1996 policy paper and ’

statements from Paul O’Neill, the
man who would become Bush 43’s
ﬁrst Treasury secretary, make the

. pre-preemption much clearer. The
paper, written before al—Qaida was '

a household name, advocated an ag-
gressive ﬁrst—strike policy against
Saddam Hussein as a means of secur-
ing a safer Middle East. The commit-
tee that composed the documentwas
headed by Richard Perle, a defense
hawk who became — you guessed
it — a close adviser to George W.
Bush’s administration. Eight years
later, after being ﬁred for dissen-
sion, O’Neill removed all doubt: In
2004, he gave the Wall Streetjournal
documents detailing Bush’s pre—9 / 11
war planning, which emphasized oil
companies eyeing Saddam’s nation-
alized oil ﬁelds.

Once 9/11 came along, the Bush
peoplefound theirchance, and the
greatAmerican intelligence bake-a-
thon began. Many publicized inter-
nal reports conﬁrmed these power
abuses years ago: The administration
pressured intelligence professionals
from multiple agencies into produc-
ing like—minded reports, cherryp-
icked those politically consistent
reports for public display and then

brutally punished dissenters (need

I mention the ousting of former CIA ,

operative Valerie Plame?). The result
was a public masterﬁilly manipulated
by fear — if you’re a citizen with criti-
cisms, well, don’t you know there’s
a war going on? — and a costly war
of false preemption. .
After all, Iraq posed no rea
threats. No relevant ties to al-Qaida
nor WMDs (I don’t count mustard
gas) were ever found. Rather, what
we found in Iraq was avast desert on

' which to dump billions of public dol-

lars, sacriﬁce 4,442 armed service
members and stage an international
relations catastrophe. Reputable
economistsjoseph Stiglitz and Linda
Bilmes predict that the ﬁnal dollar
cost of Iraq to run on the order of $3

trillion — that’s not just counting

combat ‘expenses, but also the cost
of treating wounded service mem-
bers. And then there are the more
incalculable costs: the thousands of
dead Americans, thehundreds of
‘ thousands of dead Iraqis and the 16

veterans committing suicide per day
in recent years, according to Veter-
ans Affairs Secretary Eric Shinseki.
Mission accomplished?

It should be noted that the‘9/11
fear response was manipulated for
more thanjust war—mongering. Bush
invoked the tragedy to push through
his second deﬁcit-inﬂatingtax cut in
2002, to threaten Alaskan wilder-
ness with his ANWR drilling plan
that same year, and to justify an ex-
plosion of government surveillance
powers (see the Patriot Act) that

civil liberties to this day.

Anti—Bush diatribes entered the
realm of editorial cliche years ago.
And even if my 9/11lesson’s purpose
were to bash Bush, I’d accomplish
nothing, since The Pitt News’ readers
are likely to toe a liberal line any-
way. Instead, my generation would
beneﬁt most if we remembered the
likes of Bush, Dick Cheney and Karl
Rove not for their cynicism or their
mendacity, but for the disquieting
fact that our country facilitated their

exploitation scheme.

You might say I’m blaming the
victim, and you’d have a point. The
Bush administration pursued its
anti—populist agenda with focus,
ferocity and marketing genius; it’s
hard to argue that masses of unas-
suming Americans, drunk on their
own fear, could resist being taken
advantage of. But if people my age
don’t learn 9/11’s legacy of fear, are
we to leave ourselves powerless for
the next exploiter—in~chief? Let’s do
better. I

Panthers overcome spotty offense, defeat Maine

Lauren Kirschman
Sports Editor

Maine sacked quarterback Tino
Sunseri seven times and the Pan-
thers struggled again, but Pitt
defeated the Black Bears 35-29 on
Saturday afternoon.

Much like in Pitt’s 35-16 win
over Buffalo last week, the offense
seemed to ﬁnd more rhythm in
the second half. But the team’s ad-
justment to new head coach Todd
Graham’s system is still a work in
progress.

Right guard Lucas Nix said the
blame for the seven sacks falls on
the offensive line. '

“We have ﬁve guys and they
didn’t bring a lot more than ﬁve,”
he said. “We’re still working out
some little things, but we will get
it corrected.”

I K Even Pitt’s experienced defense
didn’t impress against the Black
Bears. Graham said that overall,
the Panthers are making too many
mistakes. ’

“We’re killing ourselves mak-
ing mental errors,” he said. “We’re
playing good defense for periods
of time, and then we turn the ball
over on offense.”

Maine head coachjack Cosgrove"
said that going into the game, he
felt his team would be able to attack

.,Pitt in the passing game. The Black
Bears succeeded, burning the Pitt
defense with several long passes.

“We then figured out some
things that we could do — some
sprint and play-action things —
and I thought our quarterback kept

/"his pose,” Cosgrove said.

Pitt’s own quarterback threw
two interceptions and wasn’t aided
by several dropped passes by his
receivers.

“Mistakes happen in the heat

.-..of battle,” Sunseri said about the
offense. “When you’re out there
you have to make fast decisions,
and sometimes you make improper
decisions.”

Sunseri ﬁnished the game with
224 yards on 21-35 passing and two

“interceptions.

Although Graham said that Sun-
seri has the mostdiﬂicult job in his

system, Sunseri said he embraces
his role as a quarterback — mis-
takes and all.

“You are a quarterback your
entire life,” he said. “I like that re-

sponsibility. I like making the plays, ,

making the throws. And when I
make a mistake, Ilike watching
the ﬁlm and ﬁxing it.” -

Wide receiver Mike Shanahan
said he doesn’t, think the offense
regressed this week.

“I don’t think it got worse,”

he said. “I think, it’s just the little
things. Down in the red zone we
had some opportunities to ﬁnish
and we have to score touchdowns.
We can’t settle for ﬁeld goals.”

ThePanthers could’ve run the
ball on every play and avoided Sun-
seri’s two interceptions, Graham
said, but he wanted a proliﬁc and
dynamic offense.

Graham added that the defense
could have stopped blitzing and
still have been effective, but he
wanted the defense to attack.

“The most positive thing I can
say about that game is that we’re
2-0,” Graham said. “We deﬁnitely
played down to the level of compe-
tition. We didn’t play very well.”

After Sunseri’s second inter-
ception, backup quarterback Trey
Anderson entered the game early

in the fourth quarter and led a Pan— V

ther scoring drive which increased

the Pitt lead from 28-15 to 35-15.
Anderson completed four of ﬁve

passes for 26 yards — including

two third—down conversion passes .
' — during the drive, before Zach

Brown ran one yard into the end
zone for a touchdown. '

1 Todd ‘Graham said that he
planned to use Anderson in the
game and that the change at quar-
terback wasn’t a reﬂection on Sun-
seri’s performance.

“I still have 100 percent belief

in Tino,” Graham said. “He has
a difficult job. Tino is our No. 1

quarterback. I believe in him and '

what he’s doing. He’s just got to
get better.”

At least one Panther doesn’t
need any more time to adjust to
the offensive changes. Running
back Ray Graham racked up 121
yards and three touchdowns on

Pitt quarterback Tino Sunseri threw for 224 yards on 21-35 p

28 carries. A

“He is just absolutely phenom-
enal,” Coach Todd Graham said.
“It’s not just his skills; it’s how he
plays the game with tremendous
passion.” .

With the Panthers holding on to
a slim ﬁve-point lead in the third

quarter and the Heinz Field crowd f

growing restless, Ray Graham took
over on Pitt’s next drive and scored
his third touchdown of the day.
Sunseri completed a pass to
Graham for 13 yards to start the

,.. -.-.:.\......~,..

drive, then another eight-yard pass
brought the Panthers to the Maine
24. Sunseri found Graham again to
move Pitt to the 1 yard line, then
Graham ran the ball in. W

Maine head coach Jack Cos-
grove said Pitt responded like he
expected the team to.

“We closed the gap, and like a
good football team should, they
responded,” he said. “I don’t think
it was on our end. I think Pitt said,

‘Holy cow, we gotaball game here.’I . ’

win over Maine at Heinz Field on Saturday.

a good football team should.”

Pitt led 28-15 following a two-
point conversion from Sunseri to
Mike Shanahan.

The Pitt defense performed
well early as Maine didn’t pick up
a ﬁrst down until 13:28 remaining
in the second.quarter. But the Black
Bears used that momentum to fuel
a scoring drive, ending with a 22-

yard pass from'quarterback War- .

ren Smith to wide receiver Derek
Buttles for a touchdown to slim the
Panther advantage to 12-7.

THROWING A KIRSCHBALL

Pitt fans should be

patient with

Lauren Kirschman
Sports Editor

Maybe Pittfans should have listened less to Todd ,,
Graham’s rhetoric and more to their common
sense.

Maybe everyone expected just a little too
much.

Ifthe Panthers’ struggles against Buffalo and
Maine proved anything, it’s thatasystem overhaul
as massive as the one Graham is heading at Pitt
takes time.

Pitt is moving from Dave Warmstedt’s me-
thodical pro-style ofplayto Graham’s (eventually)
high—octane, explosive, no-huddle philosophy.

It’s fast. It’s complicated. And the players are
human. , '

Those fans who expected to see the Panthers
dominate with Graham’s system right at the be-
ginning of the season probably need a reality
check.

Those fans calling for Tino Sunseri to take a
seat on the bench — I’m talking to you, people
booing in the student section — really need a

‘ reality check. .

Sure, freshman backup quarterback'I‘rey An-
derson looked impressive leading the offense
for the short amount of time that he was on the
ﬁeld.

~ WhenAnderson completed four of ﬁve passes
for26 yards —' includingtwo third-down conver-
sion passes — onatouchdown drive, the depleted A
(and that’s putting it lightly) crowd at Heinz Field
started daydreaming aboutafreshman superstar
taking over the offense.

I’ll admit, I was impressed with Anderson,

v too. He didn’tlooklike afreshman and he looked

more than comfortable running the no—huddle
offense, which is similar to the offense that he
ran in high school.

Sunseri, on the other hand, struggled for
most of the day and threw two interceptions.
Buthe deserves afew more games to adjustbefore
Panther fans start calling for  to take a seat
on the bench.

The Pitt offense hasn’t looked good. That’s a

_ fact. But that blame falls on more players than

new system

just Sunseri.

He was sacked seven times against Maine.
Some of that stems from Sunseri missing reads
from the opponents defense, but mostly it means
there is trouble on the offensive line.

The line’s performance on Saturdaywouldn’t
protect Sunseri, Anderson or last year’s Heisman
Trophy—winner Cam Newton.

And the Pitt receivers didn’t help Sunseri’s

cause much as they dropped their fair share of ‘

passes. . V A

After the game, Graham expressed his conﬁ-
dence in Sunseri. He admitted that the starter had
to get better, and Sunseri said the same, adding
that he’s, going to learn from his mistakes.

Anderson said he expects Sunseri to bounce
back:; ide receiver Mike Shanahansaid the team
has.  ", deiicel-in the redshirt junior quarter-
back.: . 2 " ‘ if _ A

Unlike Anderson, Sunseri is adjusting to the
no-huddle system. It’s going to take some time.
Patience, it seems, is not Pitt fans’ virtue. ‘

It’s funny — just a few years ago students
spent their time in the student section booing,
Bill Stull and chanting for Tim Sunseri. How
things have changed. ‘

I’ll need to see a little more of Anderson be-

  
  

. fore I decide that he should take over the start-

ing position.»It’s going to take more than one
drive for the freshman quarterback to replace
the second-year starter. . ,

Meanwhile, maybe it’s time for Panther fans
to adjust their expectations forthis year’steamas
awhole. Graham came into the program talking
about a Big East Championshipland a BCS Bowl,
but those might not happen this season.

It might take a few years for Graham to suc-
cessfully insmll his philosophy at Pitt. Still, Pitt
could getahandle on the new system before the
BigEast season comes around. After all, Graham
does have a track record to back up  talk.

He turned Rice around fromal-11 seasonto a
7-5 ﬁnish and abowl game in one year. Tulsa ﬁn-
ished 10-4 duringGraham’sﬁrstseason, crushing
Bowling Green 63-7 in the GMAC Bowl. ’

fPantherfanswilljusthavetowaitalittlelon- ‘

ger, try to be patient, and see what happens —
with Sunseri and the rest of the team. I -

Graham:  
Defense
needs work

Recap < 8

“Last week we watched the ﬁlm on the
Pitt vs. Buffalo game, and Pitt got beat on a
similar play like that —' but the guy dropped
it for Buffalo twice,” Smith said. “We knew if
we came in and did ma'n—to-man coverage,

. then we would be able to do that double play

move.”
Graham said the Panthers need to improve

N defensively.

“We’re giving up stupid plays in the pass-
ing game,” he said. “It’s ridiculous and it
should not be happening.”

’ Pitt responded two possessions later as
Sunseri found Hubie Graham down the mid-
dle for a 25-yard pickup. Ray Graham ran the
ball in from 3 yards out a play later.

Sunseri successfully rushed in for the two-
point conversion to put Pitt ahead 20-7 going

_ into the break. -

The second half opened with a promis-
ing Pitt scoring drive, but Maine cornerback
Kendall James intercepted a Sunseri pass to

the end zone to keep the Panther advantage »

at 13 points.
A Maine slimmed the Pitt advantage to 20-15
when Smith found Derek Session wide open

pin the end zone and holder Chris Treister
took the ball in for a two-point conversion

after a botched snap.
‘ Pittran 90 plays, ﬁnishing with 381 yards
to Maine’s 371. The Panthers picked up 124
rushing yards, whereas Maine gained just 37
yards on the ground. 4 -

“Last year at this point we were 1-1 and
coming off the loss to Utah,” Sunseri said.
“We’re 2-0 and a lot of teams around college

football right now are getting upset by teams I

that are beneath them.”
Pitt travels to Iowa on Sept. 17 for its ﬁrst
