For The Pitt News

Most Pitt students interviewed yester-
day said they did not know the specif-
ics of the Port Authority’s_ decision to
cut some bus services in March but
several expressed disappointment in
the idea. _

Junior Megan Neufsaid she uses the
711) to, get to and from work, adding
that she already has trouble getting a
bus and is concerned about how much
more difficult it will become when the
cuts take effect starting March 27.

“Even now it seems like there has

i vbeenareductioninservicej’ Neuf said.

“It is really hard to get a bus headed

V into town during rush hour‘ and some

of the scheduled buses almost never
come as itis.” ’

Max Pless, also a junior, also ex-
pressed concern about the changes.

_Pless used the buses frequently last

year and remembered that even when
the 71Awas runningon schedule itwas
often very crowded. “I hope.they ﬁnd
funding. Public transportation is an
amazing resource for both students
and the community,” Pless said.
Other students and commuters re-
 Pless’ concerns throughout the
afternoon, calling on the state legisla-
ture and local govemmentto preserve
funding for the Port Authority.

The scheduled cuts come after out- i

going Gov. Ed Rendell redirected $45
million into the ailing transit system,

and the state and local governments
18 months to ﬁnd additional funding.
Port Authority board members said
that without more ﬁmding, public
transportation in Pittsburgh could be
cutby between 35 and 50 percent. I

Those in charge of the medical

with the published commentary.

Save ourpsoles,

Pitt needs action from leadership over the Port
Authority service reductions

0 one picks a college for
the transportation.
Even if the surround-

ing city could smoothly shuffle
students from place to place
on state—of—the-art magnetic
monorails, few applicants would
consider a school that required
their parents to take out two
mortgages per semester or of-
fered classes taught by Klingons.
Though we might not use public
transit differences to decide be-
tween undergraduate programs,
we Pitt students shouldn’t forget
the importance of a functioning
transportation system to our
education.

. And neither should Chancel-
lor Mark N ordenberg.

The Port Authority is suffer-
ing, and if something isn’t done
soon, so will Pitt. Thestudent
body needs to raise its voice, and
University leadership at the high-
est level needs to listen to it and
act accordingly.

Facing severe budget pres-
sures, the Port Authority’s board
of directors approved a plan on
Wednesday that would reduce
bus services 15 percent by late
March (see coverage on page 1).
Although more substantial cuts
were initially projected, a last-
minute infusion of $45 million
from Gov. Ed Rendell allowed
the Port Authority to run at 85
percent current service levels in-
stead of something closer to 65
percent. But as CEO Steve Bland
said in a special board meeting
held yesterday, using the emer-
gency funds is only a “temporary
solution.” If no new funding is
found by July 2012, the Port Au-
thority could be forced to run at
near half its current capacity.

Even a seemingly small 15 per-
cent service reduction equates to
29 eliminated bus routes and re-
ductipns in many of the remain-
ing routes, including several ones
passing through Oakland. With
so much of the Pitt population re-
lying on the Port Authority to get

from front door to classroom or
workplace, trying to imagine how
a 50, percent service reduction
will affect the University goes be-

yond the realm of unsettling.

It’s not only that the economic
effect of a crippled bus system
could devastate Pittsburgh as

a whole, as several speakers 8

noted at yesterday’s meeting.
Pitt should be worrying about
itself.

Consider, if you dare, the Pitt
experience in the post—Port Au-
thority era. Barely able to house
incoming freshmen as it is, the
University could face an un-
precedented flood of on-campus
housing applicants and have to
consign students to brutally long
walks to class. Pitching ‘the Steel
City to prospective students as a
marketplace worthy of exploring
could soon become a farce, as
students choose to stay in their

dorms and as businesses close_

due to fewer customers. And

4 worst of all, with fewer buses and
’more cars on the road, a cam-
. "pus bound by ribbons of asphalt

could suddenly become much
more dangerous. ' _

If not for the sake of the city,
we should appreciatethe grav-
ity of the Port Authority issue
as it pertains to Pitt’s interests.
Harrisburg legislators need to
be educated on this issue, and
someone powerful -needs to facili-
tate this educational process. We
feel that Chancellor Nordenberg,
occupying an optimal position of
inﬂuence as a member on Gov.-
elect Tom Corbett’s transition
committee, is ripe for the job.
A public statement would be a
start.

As we wait on Nordenberg to
decide a course of action, The Pitt
News will like to announce our
intent on investing in bicycles in
the near future. If you’re a sea-
soned rider, feel free to e-mail
us your advice, as'frankly, we’re
more of bus-kind of people. I

Also, herlawyers fromthe Ameri-_

Accordingto theAssociated Press,
over the past year Pennsylvania police

ranged from the aforementioned

certain conditions and ultimately, the
rules of the game. I ‘

1. Choose yourpartners wisely. This

you ask an acquaintance or someone

2. Take caution when involving
couples. Whether you are the one in
a relationship or the one invited into
the mix, there are deﬁnitely more risks
presented when a twosome branches
out. Jealousy often takes over. If you
have a boyﬁiend or girlfriend, watch-
ing someone else perform with them

won’t ruin the experience. Just take

when it’s planned, to say whats good

4. Provide equal attention. Everyone ,

6. Use protection. I always say
this, but it is really important. Could
youimagine if aone person’s boyfriend
got the other girl pregnant? Or some-

one transmitted an STD to two people
at once? That’s twice the nightmare.
Instead ofhavingto worryabout it, just
use a condom and get tested before-

bring several of them. Threesomes
mean moving around and possible in-

Chances are,the condomwon’t endure

Gallery offers classes on crafting

The Society for Contemporary Craft has a variety of classes for their upcoming classes including felting and knitting

With the recent snow drifting
onto Pittsburgh sidewalks, many
people are bundling up in thick
wool scarves and funky knitted
headbands. On their way to class,
they tote stylish handbags.

But many of these items, espe-
cially when they’re quality, cost
quite a bit of money. Increasingly,
people are making these trendy
items themselves.

The Society for Contemporary
Craft, a gallery in the Strip Dis-
trict, offers classes throughout
the year in its Drop—in Studio. The
various classes teach students the

skills for different do—it—yourself
projects .

Offering classes from making
recycled art to crafting a spring
ﬂower necklace, the gallery’s class
schedule through the winter and
spring provides instruction on a
variety of DIY projects.

Casey Droege is one of the
instructors at the Society for
Contemporary Craft. A faculty
member at the Art Institute of
Pittsburgh, she has a- degree in
ﬁbers and textiles but currently
does interdisciplinary artwork,
she said. V

Droege, who is a self—employed
artist, is very familiar with DIY
crafts.She has knitted on and off
for years and learned when she
was young. Both her parents were
artists, so art was always natural

‘T for her. - V

“I feel the need to create,” she
said. i ‘

Next month, Droege will teach
a class at the gallery called “Knit-

ting from the Hip,” which will help knitters
of all levels. The class focuses on. the basic
elements of knitting, she said, and will teach
students to create different shapes through
the stitches. '

“The main goal is just to get everybody
comfortable with the ideas of knitting
and comfortable'wit~h the act of knitting,”
Droege said.

“Knitting from the Hip” consists of two A

Saturday classes. The ﬁrst class teaches
students the basic skills of knitting, where
the second introduces more complex skills.

Students will learn how to incorporate dif-.
ferent colors into the patterns and develop - f

a structured shape with the stitches.

By the end of the two lessons, Droege '
hopes the students will feel comfortable

following their own “intuition, mind and
imagination” without using a pattern.
Annie Lawrence also teaches a class at
SCC called “Felted Handbags.”'It will ‘be a
one—dayclass’ held on March 19 from 9 a.m.

to 5 pm. It will teach students to make their
own felt handbag through a complex and

artistic process, Lawrence said.
“The goal is to have the handbag made by

the end of the day,” she said. “I’d like them . 

to go home with“a ﬁnished project.”

But the process will not be quick. Law-
rence explained the “Felted Handbags” class
teaches how -to produce the felt. Students
workewith merino wool roving to make the
felt they use for the handbag. S

“It’s not diﬂicult, but it’s labor intensive.
It’s-not a fast process,” Lawrence said.

The ﬁnished product will be a small, felt 4,

consist of six or eight layers of the merino
wool roving, which holds together but still
remains soft, she said. _ s V

Lawrence has been felting —- the process
of making felt —— for almost seven years
and is a member of the Fiber Arts Guild of
Pittsburgh, a nonproﬁt organization dedi-
cated to supporting ﬁber arts. Felting acts
as a sort of release for her, she said, and
she enjoys experimenting with thedifferent
types of wool. . A A

they all have the same sort of things,” she
said. “With felting, you get to create your

own types of fabric, which then gets used 

in garment making or accessories.”

Though both classes are open to all, they
are a little pricey for most college students.
“Knitting from the Hip” costs $125 for the
two classes and “Felted Handbags” costs $75
plus an additional $20 materials fee.

Luckily, there are scholarship options
available for college students. Laura Rundell,
the director of education at SCC, works to
provide interested students with the oppor—-
tunity to participate in the classes.

The scholarships are open to ‘students
who apply, but they are limited to the amount
of funding available. Students interested in
scholarships can call the society. They must
be able to provide a student ID.

The mission of SCC is to engage the pub-
lic, she said, and the classes and scholarship
opportunities stick by that mission. Classes
that would otherwise be too expensive for
some students become quickly accessible.

With these and other DIY options avail-
able, there is no need to solely rely on pur-
chasing trendy accessories.

“We really feel committed to making [the
scholarships] available to a broad base of
people; people from all different groups,”
Rundell said. i

credited and praised for pioneering the
Clan’s inﬂuential sound — bleak, esoteric
rhymes overlaying brittle beats. He’s also
known for drawing upon not just other
styles, but also other mediums for source
material. The group’s songs are often in-
terspersed with samples from martial—arts
ﬂicks.

Since his meteoric rise to the upper
echelons of rap, which includes a ﬂurry

of merchandise and collaborations with

A—listers like Kanye West, RZA has followed
the example of his colleague Ice Cube and
dabbled in acting (“Ghost Dog,” “Coffee and
Cigarettes”) —— often making cameos.
Recently, however, the Brooklyn na-
tive transcended occasional stardom to

become a full—ﬂedged Hollywood player. ~

In an improbable string of events, the man

who once lived in the projects and was '

accused — and later acquitted of — at-
tempted murder is now slated to direct
kung-fu ﬂick “The Man With the Iron Fist”
for Universal Pictures. Eli Roth will serve
as the producer, co—writer and adviser and
—— according to IMDb —. Russell Crowe and
Lucy Liu are the stars.

Predictably, this news engendered a -

ﬂurry of ironic enthusiasm and more ear-
nest skepticism. After all, RZA has little to
no experience in the director’s chair. Or
rather, no positive experience, as the rap-
per/producer has an unreleased ﬁlm to his
name, “Wu-Tang vs. the Golden‘ Phoenix,”
whose trailers 4 a hodgepodge of low-bud-
get karate amidst anonymous forest clear-
ings — recall the inexpert enthusiasm of
high school cinema classes. Aside from the
normalizing effects of major studio back-

ing,'there’s 'nothi’ri‘g tosuggest RZA’s, latest _

effort will be any more enlightened.

Nevertheless, “The Man With the Iron '

Fist” demands engagement if for no other
reason than the fact that it raises a fascinat-
ing question: What happens when an artist
is so enthusiastic about another art form
that he converts to that form? As even a
cursory listen to the Clan’s debut album,
Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), affirms,
RZA has a remarkable talent for integrating
ﬁlms into music. Now, he seeks the oppo-

site: channeling his musical sensibilities I

into his movies.
A ﬁtting, albeit unlikely, parallel to this
scenario is the music of director David

Lynch (“Eraserhead,” “Mulholland Dr.”). A" \
A revered auteur, Lynch, who -makes disturb-

ing, sensory ﬁlms with acclaimed sound-
tracks, recently released two rnodern blues
singles,t“Good Day Today” and “I Know.”

Both pieces begin innocuously enough,

— the former has a quasi—/danceable beat,

the latter a simmering chill down vibe —'

before veering into sinister, distorted vo-
cals and alarming lyrics. In other words,
they’re both distinctly “Lynchian,” as they
sound like music only the director would

make.

Unfortunately, the two singles don’t
bode well for future artistic crossovers.
Whereas they are not without merit, they
seem only a two-dimensional reﬂection of
the director’s cinematic output —~they’re
creepy, but in a less provoking way. Al-
though Lynch displays an uncanny mastery
of sound in ﬁlms like “Blue Velvet,” he has
yet to realize the nuances and possibilities

V of music not supplemented by images.

David Lynch unsuccessful in transition

This is not to say RZA’s ﬁlm is destined
to be as disappointing as Lynch’s. Although
the rapper’s passion for the kung-fu genre
doesn’t necessarily foretell a bad movie, it
does foretell an uninteresting one. How-
ever “The Man With the Iron Fist” turns
out — inexpert, disorienting or unexpe€t—
edly brilliant ‘—,,it will allow audiences
another glimpse at the great pop culture
experiment of the 21st century: the cross-

Hynoski reflects on NFL draft decision

NFL next season.

Former Pitt running back Dion
Lewis set all kinds of rushing re-
cords in his two years as a Panther
before declaring for the NFL draft
Monday.

But it was a less—heralded player
in Pitt’s backﬁeld, ﬁillback Henry
Hynoski, whose crushing blocks

paved the way for a lot of those

runs. ,
That kind of play put Hynoski on
the radar of NFL scouts and he too

along with Lewis and receiver Jon
Baldwin, who will forego their re-
maining eligibility at‘Pitt.

_' “My decision’s made up,”.

22-year-old Hynoski, said. “That’s
deﬁnitely what I want to do and I
think that was the best option for
me.”

The departure of the three un-
derclassmen is an oddity for the
school’s football program, which is
on its third head coach in a month.
N o Pitt underclassmen left early for

the NFL draft last season. LeSean
McCoy was the only underclassmen
to declare for the 2009 draft.
After he ﬁlled out paperwork
with the NFL to see where he might

Pitt dominates Georgetown, stays undefeated in Big East

Dustin Gabler

used a nearly ﬂawless ﬁrst half to
defeat No. 19 Georgetown 72-57

I Hynoski played in Wannstedt’s pro-style

T It’s safe to say that 5—foot-8,‘ 195—pound
Lewis will have toadjust to the NFL. Ray Rice,
who had success in the Big East at Lewis’ size,
is up to 212 pounds with the Baltimore Ravens.
Meanwhile, former Panther LeSean McCoy
spent last offseason with the Philadelphia
Eagles adding muscle and mastering their
playbook. ,

Lewis needs playing time and countless
hours in the gym, and he won’t get that with
an NFL lockout. He is about as inexperienced

.a drafcprospect as they come, thanks to time

atprep school that allowed him to leave after

just two seasons at,Pitt. Another year in college
would have helped. .

If Pitt football’s off—ﬁeld issues were Lewis’
main gripe, a third option existed. He could
have transferred. ' -

Transfer rules force a student athlete to sit
out for a season when he or she moves from
one FBS (formerly called Division 1) school to
another. That wouldn’t have solved anything,
but Lewis could have bypassed that lost year
by transferring to a junior college and then

Lewis needs to bulk up for NFL"

back to an FBS school, a la Cam Newton. Still _
it would take the world’s greatest pitchman
to talk a 20-year-old into junior college_over
the NFL. _

The allure of the pros probably sealed the
deal. Coaching changes, a possible lockout —
these curveballs matter little to athletes who
have dreamed of playing professional footbalir‘
since they watched “Rugrats.”

In the end, the decision to move on -— right
or wrong — was Lewis’ to make. Now that it’s
been made, all we can do is cheer him on. I
