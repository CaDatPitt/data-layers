N 0 contest
for SGB
hopefuls

‘ Estelle Tran
, Assistant News Editor

It appears that the candidates for
Student Government Board positions
won’t have any competition.

There’s one candidate runningfor
president, current board member
Charlie Shull, and eight candidates
running for the eight spots on the
board.

The board decided to move the

6 application deadline back from Oct.

21 to Oct. 28 because of the low num-
ber of applicants, board member Nila
Devanath said.

Devanath told The Pitt News that
a negative shift in public opinion of
SGB, especially afterthe G-20 Summit
riots, might have been a factor.

SGB elections chair Sarah Heisey
said that all of the candidates turned in
their applications before Oct. 21, but
two needed until Oct. 23 to complete
their petitions. .

She said that about 18 applicatio
went out, but that’s no indication of
how many people will run for board.

People may still apply for latecan-
didacy; however, they need twice as
many signatures on their petitions.
Candidates runningforpresidentneed
250 signatures, andthose runningfor
board positions require 200.

The deadline for late candidacy is
Nov. 11. Heisey said thatthe boardwill
not push back the election day, which
is set for Nov. 19.

Pitt funding a gamble

Amount of state funding to Pitt dependent on gambling bill

Michael Macagnone
Senior Staﬁ’ Writer

Pitt could receive state funding,
which is already four months late,
in the next two weeks.

But the amount of money the
University receives will hedge on
the fate of a gambling bill.

. A 1966 law requires the state

to give Pitt appropriations — or
funding — every year. Normally,
Pitt learns how much money it
will receive by July 1, the day the
Pennsylvania state budget must
be approved. But negotiations in
the state legislature lasted three
months longer than normal, end-
ing on Oct. 9.

Now, the state is awaiting the
outcome of a table games bill be-

fore it will decide — by creating a
separate bill — how much money
Pitt will receive.

A bill that allows and regulates
table gaming in Pennsylvania
could pass in the next week. The
state government expects the bill
to bring in $200 million in tax
revenue over the next year.

“Everything is tied to table
gaming,” said state Rep. Ron Mill-

“We’re chilling out aﬁerwards,

were about to graduate. And he
said, ‘Honestly, just go crazy. Make
yourself be heard. When you get
out there, just go nuts. ‘Go crazy.’
And I was like, that’s actually really
good advice. It sounds«so cliché,

Pitt could lose $35 million in Westridge investments

 _ Michael Macagnone
Senior Staff Writer

University ofﬁcials say Pitt students
won’t be affected by a drop in en-
dowment funds and its $35 million
loss in investments, at least notthis
year. .
Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele said
that while the University’s endow-
ment dropped by about 20 percent

and an alleged fraud scheme involv-

ingwestridge Capital Management, 5 ‘

Inc., could cost the University mil-

. lions more, Pitt will not cut fund-

ing for many programs, particularly
those outside the classroom.
“All programs depending on en-

dowment ﬁmding will receive their ’

funding this year,” he said.
The amount of its endowment
that Pitt spends every year is deter-

_ mined by a formula. Pitt calculates

the average market value of the en-
dowment over the past three years,
then allows 4.25 percent of that value
to be spent, Fedele said.

The University also follows an-
other policy, called a “ﬂoor policy,”
and won’t spend less of its endow-
ment than it did the previous year.

“This is going to havea negligible A
effect on students,” Fedele said.

Fedele also said students will
remain, for now, fairly untouched

by an alleged fraud scheme involv-
ing Westridge Capital Management,
Inc., a company that’s executives,

- Paul Greenwood and Stephen Walsh,

have been accused of misappropriat-
ing approximately $553 million.
Fedele said the University invest-

ed about $65 million in funds with"

Westridge, and thatAPitt’s assets had

before the alleged fraud scheme. The

er, R—York County, who serves on the state
House’s appropriations committee.

“It may be possible for the non—pre—
ferred institutions to get fundingiwithout
table games, but it depends on how you do
the math,” he said. »

State law classiﬁes Pitt, along with Penn
State, Temple and Lincoln universities, as
a “non-preferred_”l institution. This means
that legislators determine how much mon-
ey the universities will receive by creating

 

    58 ll¢|".‘.'«*'5’ 

  Lailx ta l ll. about

 

bills separate from the state budget. The
bill that contains Pitt’s appropriation went
to a state Senate committee on Oct. 8. It
could be two or more weeks before the bill
passes, said Miller and state Rep.Jim Ferlo,
D—Highland Park. V

If the bill passes, Pitt will receive $176
million in appropriations —— about $12
million less than the $189 it originally ex-
pected to receive. This could be the smallest
appropriation Pitt has received in three
years. _ '

Pitt’s appropriations haven’t arrived
this late since 2002, when the University
received its state appropriations several
days before Christmas. .

Pitt spokesmanjohn Fedele said Pitt has
other funding streams that will help “tie us
over” until the state money arrives.

Fedele said that the decision of Pitt’s
appropriation doesn’t always come onjuly
1, but it usually isn’t this late. .

State legislators said the worldwide eco-
nomic recession contributed to the delay
in budget decisions and decisions about
Pitt’s appropriations. The state had two
choices: It could either raise revenues by

increasing taxes or cut state spending on

state programs.
“State government, not just Pennsylva-
nia but across the country, is not immune to

V this recession. No area of state government

funding was sacred,” Ferlo said.

Gov. Ed Rendell and many Democrats in
the House and Senate favored increases in
taxes to keep state spending the same or
more. The majority of Republicans in the
House and Senate favored cuts in spend-
ing over increasing taxes in the middle of
a recession, Miller said. A '

The two sides were not able to agree on
a state budget for months, Miller said. Ren-
dell signed a budget with spendingcuts and
no large tax increases on Oct. 9, according
to the State budget office website.

The budget was three months and one
week past the July 1 deadline mandated by
the state constitution.

A separate law, which dates to 1966,,

A mandates that the state send appropria-

tions to Pitt. That same law states that the
bill for Pitt’s funding should be approved
July 1, the same day the state budget is
due.

State appropriations accounted for 11
percent of Pitt’s budget in the 2008 ﬁs-
cal year.

  Opinions

Editorial

40 years of Big  

Bird isn’t enough

new study from the Uni-
A versity at Albany SUNY

connects increased TV
watching with aggressive behavior
in 3-year-old children. The report,
however, published in the Archives
of Pediatrics 8: Adolescent Medi-
cine, does not specify what pro-
grams the kids are watching. While

_ an “It’s Always Sunny in Philadel-

phia” marathon would traumatize
toddlers, programming like “Sesa-
me Street” can beneﬁt them. , —

4 In the experiment, researchers
assessed children exposed to an
average of three daily hours of tele-

vision, quite a lot for a 3 year-old. .
Television is not a supplement .

for parenting or social interaction,
but the right shows can comple-
ment these things. Modern par-
ents cannot spend every waking
hour teaching their children, nor
can they afford babysitters to ﬁll
every attention void. Thankfully,
they can send their kids to where
the air is sweet.

“Sesame Street” will celebrate
its 40th birthday when the new
season starts on Nov. 10. ‘For four
decades, ‘children have gotten» a
quality education from the pro-
gram. ‘ »

This‘ is possible because “Sesa-
me Street” is more than just a TV
show. It is an organization that uses

multiple media outlets to educate ‘

kids. , g l .
In watching the show, children
develop a cultural vocabulary that
allows them to socialize with oth-
ers. They can talk on the playground

about their favorite character or en- ‘

gage a classmate wearing a Grover
T-shirt. ,

That interest then carries into
the Sesame Workshop’s other ven-
tures. Maybe the child wants to
read a book with Ernie and Bert on
the cover. Maybe kids make friends
when they go to see “Sesame Street

Alone, the show still has a
positive impact. In the Journal of
Applied Developmental Psychol-

ogy, a research article titled “The
Children’s Television Act: A public
policy that beneﬁts children” stated
that “Academically focused pro-
grams, most notably Sesame Street,
helped increase young children’s
vocabulary, prepared children for
school and had a positive impact on
grades and book reading traceable
through high school.”

Also, the Sesame _Workshop
estimates that the show reaches
millions of disadvantaged kids in

' other countries, as well as children

with parents who are deployed in
the military. e
Some of the show’s success is

because adults enjoy it, too. Try to
watch the Yep Yep aliens without .
laughing. It exists in a quirky world _

ﬁlled with androgynous monsters,
depressive hobos and hallucinat-
ing birds — until 1985, only Big
Bird could see Snuflleupagus. Jim
Henson created a wild and fantastic
cast. After 40 years, it is a place of
nostalgia for grown-ups.

“Sesame Street” has changed
a lot since its premiere. A New
York Times article chronicles how
Cookie Monster gave up smoking a
pipe and how Oscar found Zoloft.
Yet it remains relevant, educational

and entertaining, so‘long as parents
use it in small doses. The American V

Academy of Pediatrics recommends
a maximum of two hours of “quality
programming” per day.

The Sesame Workshop organi-"

zation does not claim that TV will
act as a panacea for illiterate chil-
dren. Rather, it says, “We know me-
dia alone can’t solve the problems
of our world.” This is an acknowl-
edgment that “Sesame Street” can-
not replace the social development
children gain by interacting with
friends and family members.

Parents still need to read to their V

kids or take them to a playground.
But on a rainy day, there is nothing
wrong with sweeping the clouds
away every now and then. Happy
birthday, “Sesame Street.” Here’s to
another 40. Just get rid of Elmo.

Dorin Dickerson (right) might play‘

tight end, but if you were to look up
the deﬁnition of a complete overall
football player, he would be it.
Dickerson, now a senior at Pitt,
was recruited from nearby West Al-
legheny High School to play receiver.
As one of the most electric high

[school players in recent history from

western Pennsylvania, he rushed for
1,428 yards, had 423 receiving yards
and scored 36 touchdowns in his se-
nior season.

But after seeing minimal time at
receiver his ﬁ'eshman year at Pitt, he
was moved to linebacker, where he
recorded 15 tackles in 2007, playing
inall12 oftheteam’s games.

Despite his sophomore success,
he was again moved to a new position
— tight end — before the beginning
of last season.

The switch to defense might have
frustrated some players, but Dicker-
son said it made him a better player.
It forced him to bulk up and be more
physical. '

Now he is one of the best blocking
and receiving dual—threat tight ends
in the world of college football — and
he loves the position.

“You get to hit somebody. It’s not
like you’re playing receiver, where you
barelygethit,” Dickerson said. “When
you’re a tight end, you’re in the mix ev-
ery single secon ”

Dickerson’s high school coach
Bob Palko, father of former Pitt quar-
terback Tyler Palko, said he believes
playing linebacker helped Dickerson
understand how to attack on offense.

“Learning how to read lineback-
ers’ drops and understanding how to
read coverages a little bit more helped
him,”Palkosaid. ’

This season, Dickerson leads the
Panthers with nine receiving touch-
downs while tallying 32 catches for
332 yards, rankinghimsecond on the
team.

But it seems that it’s his blocking,
nothis receiving stats, that means the
most to Dickerson.

‘To me, blocking is fun,” he said.
“There’s nothing better than seeing
somebody break a 3o~yard run off of

_ catch, block or do whatever.” V -

your block.” b

When he arrived at Pitt four years
ago, Dickerson was listed at roughly
200 pounds, but the move to line-
backer added muscle to his ﬂame. He
now weigl1s 230 pounds — enough
mass to hold off almost any rushing
linebacker. '.

He attributes this to a rigorous
personal workout routine, along with
strength and conditioning coach
Buddy Morris’ demanding regimen. .

He could also be a front runner for

Staﬁ Writer

The Pitt running game this sea-
son has been somewhat of a run-
ning-back—by—committee back-
field. Even with the emergence
of freshman tailback Dion Lewis
(bottom left), it’s unrealistic to
expect a freshman to be able to
carry a full workload.

- But he hasn’t even needed to,

as the ball has been distributed
between him, fellow fresh-
man Ray Graham (top
- left) and fullback
Henry Hynoski
at times.
This sort of
distribution might
typically cause some
jealousy among young play-
ers, who often want the ball
all of the time, but this is
far from the case with this
year’s team.

“We have good chem-
istry back there, and
that’s the way you have
‘ to be,” Lewis said. “We
all congratulate each

other every time
somebody has a
good run.”

__ Those good

runs have come

' frequently this
‘season. Not only
for Lewis, whose
play has put him
into the mix for

 

 

 

  

Big East player of the year, but
also for Graham‘ as well.

Lewis leads the Big East in
rushing with 1,029 yards, 12 total
touchdowns and an impressive
5.6 yards per carry average. Gra-
ham has 262 yards on 45 carries
for an even more impressive 5.8
yards per carry to go along with
three touchdowns.

“We help each other on the
ﬁeld and giving suggestions,”
Lewis said. “He’ll ask me if he
did something wrong or right,
and I’ll ask him if I did something .
wrong or right.” A

This type of unselﬁshness
from such young players goes
a long way toward building the
type of good team chemistry to
which Lewis alluded.

That type of team camarade-

rie, not only on the ﬁeld, but off at w

as well, is one of the big reasons
why the team has jumped to its
7-1 start.

“We’re friends onand off the
ﬁeld. We hang out all the time,
cracking jokes with each other
and stuff like that,” Lewis said.

When you throw bruising
sophomore Hynoski into the
mix with his 17 carries for 87

yards, it’s obvious that, while __3,__

even though one of the runners
might not get their number called
for a quarter or two, they will
be counted on to run the ball at
some point in the game.

So many players in football
right now draw attention to
themselves by complaining about
a lack» of touches — whether it be
Terrell Owens, Chad Ochocinco
or Larry Johnson —— and those
guys are professionals.

It’s refreshing to see players
like Lewis, Graham and Hynoski
— who aren’t even halfway done
with college —— taking a team-
first approach. It’s been beneﬁ-
cial to.tl_1e team so far this season
and willonly continue to help as
it progresses.

To the Editor,

I found your editorial _advising students to vote “_against Ravenstahl” genuinely
frightening. It actively promoted a short-sighted method of political-action that is
harmful to the whole political process. 1

It was right to show students that the electionhad deep consequences for us, but
the article’s reasoning was limited to the View of one student who sees nothing beyond
Oakland. Your argument against the ‘$50 tax on students said nothing but that it would
cost students money. Why exactly does Ravenstahl want to tax us? Where is the money
going? In other words, is it worth it? '

mal domestication became such a distinct
advantage. I e V
In 2005, Diamond sought to discover

1 not how societies develop, but how they

often fail. In “Collapse,” he points to nu-
merous factors that have contributed to
the downfall of societies and civilizations.

Deforestation, soil erosion, overhunting, .—
overﬁshing, overpopulation and other fac-

tors have all led to the collapse of societies
throughout history.
One of Diamond’s studies provides us

- with an example of environmental ne-

glect that is’ still a problem today. In 1925,
Haiti retained more than 60 percent of its
original forest cover. Today, that number
is less than 1 percent. ' ’
Haiti derives most of its energy from
charcoal — a fuel made from wood. Such
widespread deforestation removed root

. systems that were integral to healthy soil.

As Haitians removed trees and their roots,
the soil began to erode, which hasmade
the country susceptible to flooding and
often prohibits farming and crop devel-
opment.

Today, Haiti is the most impoverished
country in the Western Hemisphere and
lacks economic development and political
stability. The Dominican Republic — the
nation bordering ‘Haiti on the island of
Hispaniola — has managed its environ-
ment much more responsibly and has seen
much greater successes relative to Haiti.

Diamond does not wish to illustrate
that ecological mismanagement is always
the cause of a civilization’s collapse. “It’s

obviously true,” he writes, “that military?
or economic factors-alone may suffice.” Yet-
many societies overrun by more powerful

civilizations fell victim to their conquerors; j I

only after neglecting their environment,
thus corroding their own power.

Today, the United States faces its own
environmental challenges. Many will point
to global warming as a direct example

9 of people’s inability to act environmen-
tally responsible. However, even if onei . .

   

skeptical of climate change, ‘we still faé" 
other daunting environmental challenge’ 
that in a few generations might§beconi?‘ ~
our own society’s test. One of Diamond’s
factors that present—day societies must

7 avoid is an energy shortage —- a crisis the '

United States might face’ far sooner than“
we would prefer. . _
William Rees, professor of ecologi-
cal planning at the‘University of British
Columbia, wrote, “The most important
lesson to be drawn from ‘Collapse’ is that
resilient societies are nimble ones, capable
of long-term planning and of abandoning -

deeply entrenched but ultimately destruc- ’

tive core values and beliefs.”

Tackling the inevitable ‘problems
caused by our tremendous consumption
will be difficult over the next few decadesw.
Our most difficult challenge will be alter-_z,,
ing our perspective on our own €IlVlI'0I'l-'_:§

ingness to not only accept change but to

do,thisiswho weareandthis iswhere
we came from.’ This is a little slice of
what goes on behind the scenes and
how the whole thing started.”

So the book was born. And with
seven years worth of stories and ex-
periences, Goldman said the hardest
partwas selecting exactly what should
go in it.

“We just tried to pick a really good
variety to highlight our relationships
with our customers, each other, the
Food Network and the production
company. We compiled everything
and just had to pare it down, pare it
down and pare it down. There was so

muchwewantedtoputinthere,“Gold- ‘

man said.

One of Goldman’s favorite stories
is about a cake for a video game con-
vention.

“We made a character from the
game ‘Warhammer’ called a Squig. It’s
likeameatball ofteeth. Itwas one ofthe

Ifmaking a cameo in avideo game
doesn’t signify success, what does‘?

Goldman and his team have gar— V

nered triumph.from their creative
outlook. Utilizing methods ordinar-

ily reserved for sculptures, Goldman
explained that they frequently scour
the Internet and hardware stores 
new materials. “For a motorcycle cake
we did, we had to ﬁnd a food’-safe fog
machine that had water-soluble solu-
tion. You probably wouldn’t want to eat
something neara regular one.”

Another time they “did a cake for
NASA of the Hubble Space Telescope
and Jupiter. We hung it from the ceil-
ingand putinamotor so itwould spin.
Thenwe had to hangalightto shine on

had to cover this giant ball in fondant
and use the smallest cord possible so it
wouldn’t cast a shadow.”

Their weapons of mass consump-

“Necessity is the mother of inven-
tion,” Goldman said. “We have to look
at every cake and say ‘OK, how are we
goingto make this?’ It’s areally neat cre-
ative process, because we’re constantly
reinventing how we do things.“

Goldman is making his way to
Pittsburgh  Saturday as part of

Jazz expert talks business behind

Charlie Fishman gives insight to industry in honor of Jazz Week

Alison Smyth
Staﬁ”Wri_ter

“Inside the Business of Music”
Nov. 5, 7 p.m.

Lecturer: Charlie Fishman
Heinz Memorial Chapel

Not everyone can be a musical su-
perstar, but there is always the busi-

‘ness side of things for less prodigious

music aﬁcionados.
In honor of Jazz Week, Pitt wel-

comes jazz industry veteran Charlie
‘Fishman for his lecture, “Inside the

-Business of Music,” to tell students

just how this is possible.

_Fishman has been a producer,
festival organizer and manager to
famed jazz trumpeter Dizzy Gillespie.
He intends to _share his wealth of
knowledge and experience with the

next generation of music industry

insiders. _

“It gives those people —— students,
mostly-—— insight into the business
side of music,” he said. '

r The lecture will detail how the
music industry works, said Fishman.
Anyone who hopes to become a per-
sonal manager, promoter, booking,
agent or publicist or wants to learn

how to build a festival should at- p

tend.

“Ifyou want to promote aconcert,
what does it cost? What do you do
if you want to sell enough tickets to
pay for the concert? It’s something a
publicist needs to know,” Fishman
said.

Although the lecture focuses on

the behind-the-scenes elements of
music, that does not mean musicians
can’t learn a thing or two from Fish-
man. . _

“Musicians can come too. It’s im-
portant for them to understand the
role of a manager orbooking agent,”

‘ Fishman said.
He has the credentials to speak ~

about any and all of these roles from
personal experience.

“I’ve done all off it. I’ve been a pro-
ducer, I organized the D.C.Jazz Fest,
Iwas Dizzy Gillespie’s manager until

thebeat,

the day he died,” ‘Fishman said.
He knows how to successfully run
a festival or even a one—day special .
event. If you are looking to do thar:
same, Fishman is the man to hear. ’
“I know how to deal with sponsor— .
ship andthe Department of Parks

and Recreation in Washington,” Fish— :

man said ofhis experiencewith music

festivals.

Fishmanwill detail the “ﬁ1ncti3fi'

of each of these” in his lecture. With a A
résumé like his, you can bet he knows A
how it’s done. I

Title: Leonard Cohen, Live at the Isle of
Wight 1970
Artist: Leonard Cohen

Record Label: Murray‘Lerner; Columbia
Records

What can be said about Leonard Cohen
that hasn’t been said before?

Since the 1960s, he’s been an inﬂuential
ﬁgure in music and literature. He’s been

inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of
Fame and the Canadian Songwriters of Hall,
and his career spans ﬁve decades.

Heis simply a legend, and this DVD/CD"
set captures one of his more fantastic mo-
ments.

Whimsical and reﬂective, Leamzrd C o/am,
Live at the Isle of Wight 7970 is a DVD/CD set
of Cohen’s performance at the third and
last Isle of Wright music festival, which is
regarded as one of the largest musical events
in history.

More than 600,000 people attended the «

concert to see legends like Jimi Hendrix,

Taste,Joni Mitchell and Cohen perform. 
. A casualfan of Cohen’s music wouldnit
be too stimulated by this collection. It3s

deﬁnitely for his die—hard fans and those

V interested "in experiencing Cohen’s intro-
spective music from a variety of perspec-

tives. And this set will deﬁnitely allow them

to do that. '

Various interviews with Bob Johnston,
Judy Collins,‘Joan Baez and Kris Kristoffer—

Wsgon weave beautifully through the music of

his live performances. ' , A
Baez shares anecdotes about the famous
incident involving the stage going up ‘
ﬂames at an intersection between her pe
formance and that ofjimi Hendrix, recalli :,
“I was worried enough..That’s whyl offered

 
   

' to step in before Jimi Hendrix, because I

knew my music was a little more difficult
to burn fences down.” V ‘

She also offered a deeper look into an
lyzing the work of Cohen. “When peop} ‘e
would think that a song had to make sens’ ,

,4
4,

Leonard would prove otherwise. It doesn’t .

necessarily make sense at all. It’s just com-
ing from so deep inside of him it somehow
touches deep inside other people.”

Many of his most beloved songs are on
the CD set, but they are audio versions of
the live performance from the DVD. '

This might be disappointing for someone
hoping for a “greatest hits” compilation
or someone who prefers to listen to mus
without the background noise of ﬁrewor '
overtaking the vocals at certain poin '
which happens on “Suzanne.” V 5

Leamzrd C0/9671, Live at the Isle of Wight 7970
is not a jam record, and it’s-not a greatest
hits album. It’s a time capsule from Cohenfs
stunning career and the musical movemeﬁt
of the ’70s.

For the second consecutive year, the
Pitt women’s basketball team was
picked by Big East coaches to ﬁnish
ﬁfth overall in the conference.

_ This year, the tearnwill have to re-
place two four-year starters inShavon—
te Zellous and Xenia Stewart

Zellous now plays for Detroit Shock
and made l1istoryastheﬁrstPittwom—
en’s basketball playertobe drafted into

“title WNBA. Inherﬁrst seasonas apro-
fessional, she came off the bench and
made signiﬁcant contributions.

But despite these losses, head
coach Agnus Berenato remains very
conﬁdent about the upcoming sea-
son.

“We have very, very high goals,” she
said. “Our schedule is fabulous, and
that’s expected anytime that you’re in
the Big East.”

When asked about the one team in
the Big East that Pitt would most like
to beat, the obvious answer was the
Connecticut Huskies — a long—time
basketball powerhouse — whom the

Panthers host at home this season.
Berenato’s goals are not just short-
sighted, though. In her seventh year
as head coach of this team, Berenato
looks to build a foundation for a pro-

gramthatwill endure success in years »

to come. »

‘.‘We saidthatwewere goingtoturn
this program aroun ,” Berenato said.
“The one thingthatwewere consistent

with was that we didn’t want to have a ,

good team. We wanted to have a great

program. AndIthinkwe’reworkingon _

that right now.”

Asthe only senior onthe squadthis
season, Sophronia Sallard knows that
herleadershipwillbe keytothe team’s
success, but she is quick to give credit
to her teammates.

“I have a lot of teamm_ates that are
there to back me up,” Sallard said.
“They know that I’m the only senior,
but we have a veteran squad. We have
Shayla [Scott], who is avery good stu-
dent of the game — she knows what it
is that she needs to do. We havejania
Sims, as we .”

Sims, a junior point guard, will re-
tumthis season aftertakingamedical
redshiit because of tibial stress frac-

tures in both legs.

Sophomore Shawnice “Pepper”
Williams will also return to the team
this yearlas center. Shewasthe BigEast
athlete selectedtoplayforthe USAU19
team, but an injury held her back. ‘

Scott will change positions this
season from forward to guard and is
excited about the switch.

“Moving from forward to guard
I think is a challenge but something
that I’m really looking forward to,”
Scott said.

The women’s basketball team

made appearances in back-to-back .
. rounds of the Sweet 16 in the NCAA

Tournament.

Berenato hopes to topthis accom-
plishment in the upcoming season.

“We have agreattraditionwith aca- _
dernics, a greattraditionwithfootball,
a great tradition with men’s basketball,
a great tradition with all our Olympic
sports, but I think that we have really
tried to develop a fabulous [women’s
basketball] program,” she said.

The women’s basketball team will
host Seton Hill in an exhibition game
Nov. 1c_> to kick off its season. Tip—off
is set for 7 p.m. '

The last time Pitt sports fans had any
reasontoeventhinkaboutGregPaulus
was Dec. 20, 2007. That night atMadi-

 doo-doo—ed all over Paulus that eve-

his starting job. The NBA? Pro ball in

sports appeared dashed. Butinamove
to salvage any chance at competitive
and athletic glory, Paulus headed home

Those in Syracuse remembered
Paulus from his high school days —- a
local athlete, in the national spotlight,
recruited by top-tier programs in
both football and basketball. Paulus

had turned down the likes of Michi— .

gan and the BigHouse for Coach Kand
Cameron Indoor. Now he was back to
try his hand at football on a campus in
his hometown.

Syracusefootball, whichhadstrug-

gled for years, saw it as a publicity op-
poruinity. They gave Paulus afull-ride.

by openingday, hewas doingjustthat.
Now, eightgames intothe 2009 season,

But Paulus hasn’tbeenallthatbad,

in passer rating and ranked 69th na-
tionally. He’s thrown 10 touchdowns,

Pitt comerback Aaron Berry said.
