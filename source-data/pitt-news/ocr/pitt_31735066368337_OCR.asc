Pitt Denies Union-

By MARK A. SINDLER

The university released a state-
ment yesterday denying allegations
that the union-organizing attempt
by Book Center employees had any-

* thing to do with their firings and

suspensions,

“Pennsylvania ‘ law offers very
close protection to the rights of
employees considering the merits of
union organization,” the /statement
said. “The university is committed to
honoring those laws.”

The statement went on to say that
although disciplinary action .was
taken against several employees, the

» grievance procedure established by

the university is available to any and
all employees. Furthermore, the
statement said, in explanation of the
“no comment" ruling to the media,
Pitt’s policy is to not discuss person-

nel‘ matters publicly in order to pro— -

tect employees’ privacy.

The controversy started when two
Book Center employeees, Chuck
Delaney and Tim Brady, were fired

on Jan. I8, _because of_what they...

believed to be their attempts to form
a union at the book store. Three
other employees were given one-day
suspensions on Dec.23 and in early
January. ' /

One employee, Willian‘i"Cox,-was
suspended Jan. 12 for not working
more than the standard seven and

  Firing Connection

one-half hours on Jan. 4, considered
a peak period. ‘
“They said I was 'suspended
because I didn’t give them notice for
my leaving,”Cox said of his not

working overtime. “They didn't give "
me any warning this was going to _

happen.” .

Another employee who was put
on 35-day probation in addition to
being suspended said he believes he
was given an unfair ultimatum.

“I was suspended Decernber 23,
even though I have a medical ex_cuse
on file for a recent absence,” Victor '
Sciullo said.

“This has caused a lot of personal
stress for me. I’m even contemplat-
ing filing for workmen’s compensa-
tion."'Sciullo is also considering a
punitive damage suit against Pitt.
However, he is going to await the
outcome of the Pennsylvania Labor
Relations Board’s (LRB) ruling on
an unfair labor practice suit. ,

' The suit was filed by the Alleghe-
ny Regional Joint Board through
representative Dan Coffman. The

 board represents eight area locals of

the Retail Wholesale Department
Store Union, Local l0l of which the
Book Center employees are trying to
attain membership in.

Tom Scheid, also aboard repre-
sentative, said the LRB will eventu-

ally conduct an investigation and .

Corporate Funding to Universityl ncreases

By PEGGY FERRI

Higher education and corporate
America are facing a, difficult
decade, but in spite ofa drop in cor-
porate profits, contributions to
higher education have increased.

Gifts to higher education
amounted to $1.14 billion—a I0 per-

cent increase in I981, according to A”

Council for Financial Aid to Educa-
tion (CFAE) estimates. The report
indicated that itwas the second con-
secutive year that corporate contri-
butions have increased.

CFAE is a non-profit organiza-
tion that‘ promotes voluntary sup-
port of higher education. Pitt
enjoyed an increase of $796,000 in
corporate support during the last fis-
cal year. That is up from $1,380,000
in ’79-’80 to $2,176,000 in ’80-’8l,
according to the Office of Develop-
ment and Alumni Affairs (ODAA).

Despite significant increases in
corporate giving, 23 of the 73 other

private universities listed with Pitt in

the CFAE report experienced a,
decline in the corporate igiiiifig
according to director Bernard
Pitt
enjoyed an exceptional year because
trustees and volunteers have been
involved in seeking special corpor-
ate contributions over the last two
years‘ in support of the Capital
Campaign.

Some major participants in the
program during that period were
Gulf, U.S. Steel, Alcoa, Westing-
house, Heinz, National Steel, PPG
Industries, Mellon Bank, Allegheny
International, Joy,’ Koppers and
Rockwell. The exact figures were

the direction of the contributor.

V “Most corporations hold _ the
belief that there is a necessary part-
nership to be had with higher educa-
tion,” Koperek said. “Most give up
to 1 percent of their pre-tax profits."

Corporations are allowed to take
tax deductions for up to 10 percent
of their net income.

Koperek admitted-that a difficulty
is created because contributors tend
to give to the field of most interest to
them. Such fields are business, engi-
iieering and medicine. He stressed
that this does not mean that the lib-
eral arts are not supported. '

There are several factors that
influence whether an institution will
receive contributions from a corpo-
ration, according to Koperek. These
are quality, service and mutual
interest.

“Service,” he explained, “means
the quality of manpower and the
current recruiting .p.os_ture ofthe cor-
poration at that university.” He
added that mutual interest refers to
research being done in the corpora-

. tion’s field of interest in addition to

the corporation’s representation on
the Board of Trustees and the kind
of relationship the university enjoys
with the company.

Many efforts have been made to
see that there are good relations
between businesses and institutions
of higher education, but the Reagan
Administration has’ been looking
more into what can be done in light
of dwindling funds for higher
education. ‘

Last year, Reagan appointed a
task force to make recom-
-mendations - ~ '

’ ‘The task ‘force on Private Sector

.‘-'. ‘L -L I. <. c." .-.‘'-;+. <."s‘<.’s“.2_

Initiative’s purpose was to build a
dataibank that would catalog pro-
gress and programs between the pri-
vate and public sectors, including
efforts in education, health careand
community concerns.

Recently, the task force was dis-
solved and its recommendatioi
were compiled into a report pres-

-ented as a letter to Reagan.

According to Michael Castine,
acting director of Private'S.ector
Initiative in Washington, D.C.,’ the

‘.

report did not make anyspecific
recommendations, but did suggest
that the White House strengthen the

2 efforts already made and work on

other education programs.

“We are looking intotp/rograms to i

‘ get the private sector more involved

with black colleges, for example,”
Castine said. He explained that the
force was working mostly to see how

Pitt-‘s division of the Army
ROTC is sticking with the policy
of not admitting homosexuals to
the program, according to
Robert Nossen, civilian coordi-
nator of the program. I

Nossen said he found it diffi-
cult to "explain the policy of the
ROTC, but he did say that Pitt’s
division was never faced with the
question about admitting
homosexuals.

\

Although the acceptance of
homosexuality in today’s society
has risen, the armed services
have remained very._,9_onserva-
tive, he said, and that ‘policy
reﬂects the conservatism.

rPitt norce Maintains  
Homosexual

“People in the service are
housed in such close quarters
that it would be detrimental to
matters of morale and other mat-
ters that are necessary for a mil-
itary organization,” Nossen said.

While the national policy does
not allow a homosexual to be in
the military, a “local policy” of
Pitt’s states that any person can
sign up for an ROTC course.

“There is no discrimination of
any kind relative to who takes
the course,” he said. “However,
the university has no control
over the commissioning since the . _
criteria are established by the ser-
vices. themselves." ~

An American debate team—of
which a Pitt student was a
member—that traveled to the
Soviet Union to compete will be
the focus of a Frontline episode
in March” on ‘public television.

ate student in Slavic Languages,

October as part of a Committee.
on International Discussion and
Debate’s (CIDD) program. Pitt

Along with Skundrich, the
team was composed of Michael
Hazen, a communications pro-
fessor from Wake Forest Univer-
sity; Margaret Niles, a law
student at Stanford University;
John Tokolish, a graduate of
Middleburg College and cur-
rently a legislative aid to Sen.
Patrick Moynihan; and Front-
Iine producer-director Wayne
Ewing who led the film crew.

The Soviet students picked the
topic of the debate, which was
“War and Peace in the System of
Values of the Soviet and Ameri-

can Societies.” The debators tra-
veled to Moscow, Leningrad,
Kiev, Baku, Volgograd and
Tallin.

Although the debates were
allowed to be filmed, getting the
approval from the _ Soviet
government was a hassle,
according to Ewing.

“To gain permission to film in
the U.S.S.R. was a lengthy pro-
cess,” he said. “But once we
obtained legal access, we were
able to film everything that hap-
pened to the debators, except
when travelling or any type of
transportation.” -

States team made a “good show-
ing" in the debates, and the
Soviets were able to get a first-
hand 100K at how Americans
view the world. .
Both Skundrich and Niles
agreed that the audience reaction
varied from city to city, but the
response was always consistent.

He said, for example, that at
one point, Niles and he had
opposing viewpoints concerning
Reagan’s policies. Skundrich
said the ‘point the Americans
were trying to make to the
Soviets was that Americans who
have a gripe about the govern-
ment can voice an opinion and
take action to change it.

In response to that, one Soviet

. student said that although it is

true that all ofthe Soviets have a
common opinion, it is only that
way because all of the Kremlin’s
policies are correct. ’

Throughbut the course of the
debates, Skundrich said, the
debators strayed from the
appointed topic and began to
talk about such issues as U.S.
unemployment and crime.

During one of these’ episodes,
Skundrich brought up the topic
of Russian immigration and had
exact figures before him. He said

the student he was debating‘

became embarassed because of
his attempt to dodge the ques-
tion.

Skundrich said he and his
peers tried to show the Soviets
that their ‘government was keep-
ing things from them.

“We could only plant a seed
and hope it grows," he said.

Skundrich said he also saw an

of the Soviets in regard to the
Soviet invasion of Afghanistan
and how many Soviets were
killed in the rebel uprising.
Another point made in some
of the discussions dealt with free-
dom of the press. Skundrich said
the Soviets view our press as
being too liberal and that is the
cause for some of the social
unrest that has been evident in
America’s history. .

Skundrich pointed out to the
Soviets that, while they only
have one newspaper in which to
obtain information, Americans
have hundreds, in addition to

A individual television stations.

Debate and viewpoints aside,
the debators said the trip was an
experience not to be forgotten.

“We were treated like royalty,”
Niles said. “We attended ban-
quets, operas and official
meetings.”

She said the whole experience
was challenging because the
issues discussed were pertinent to
both countries and the audience
response was tremendous.

“The halls were overﬂowing _

with people who wanted to find
out about America,” Hazen, the
head of the delegation, said. “It
was a highly competitive contest,
just like those between schools in
America.”

Skundrich said the Soviet‘.-
American exchange should con-
tinue. The international debate
started 10 years ago with five
encounters every two years.

The next scheduled debate will
be held in America in 1984 and
the Soviet students get to pick
the topic. Skundrich said he
would like the topic to deal with
the role of the press in a free
society.

Ramificationsof Invasion

By RAY WUSLICH

The Israeli invasion of Lebanon
was a defeat of “incomparable pro-
portions for the Arabs,” according
to Pitt political science professor
and MidEast expert Richard
Cottam.

Speaking at a lecture sponsored

_  by the "Pitt International Students

«
1

Organization (PISO), Cottam said
“the short term success of the Israeli
invasion approaches the optimal.

“As far as the U.S. is concerned,

Israel could not ask for much more, '

except maybe the return of Alex-
ander Haig,” he said. .

“ Israel has benefitted from the
presence of Western occupation
forces that are paying part of the
cost of occupying Lebanon, Cottam
said. U.S. aid to Israel has not been
reduced even-though there was a loss
of sympathy for Israel by many peo-
ple in Western Europe and the U.S.,
he added.

“Most of these people don’t care
very much about the Middle East,
and their opposition has had almost
no meaning politically," he said.

- -
« er»

a

The Arabs, Cottam said, have a
feeling of hopelessness and disarray
which the lack of any significant
response to Israeli invasion
demonstrated. ~ --

According to Cottam, Israel‘s
main strategic thrust is to absorb the
West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the
Golan Heights. This main objective,
he said, dictates other goals, such as
the destruction of the Palestinian
Liberation Organization (PLO) as a
military force and the elimination of
any hope of the Palestinians for a
homeland west of Jordan.

The lack of any significant Arab
response to the invasion was to be
expected, Cottam said, and he
attributed it to the oil glut,_which
makes producers unwilling to sacri-
lice for political objectives.

Arab power has. been on the‘

decline for 10 years for a number of
reasons, such as the Sadat peace
initiative, Cottom said. '

“His (Sadat’s) strategy was na_ive
to the extreme,” Cottam said.
“Sadat believed that the U.S. liked
him enough to put. pressure on

* Israel. He broke ranks with the

Arabs and threw out the Soviets, on
whose weapons they depended.

 ‘Incomparable,’ Cottam Says

When he died, the U.S. was the only
country to mourn him. V

In addition, the failure of the
Baghdad Conference for Arab
Unity and the failure to take advan-
tage of the Iranian revolution-
after which Iran changed sides and
became hostile to lsrael—further
weakened the Arab position, Cot-
tam said.

It may be that the Israeli invasion
will produce far-reaching conse-
quences that are unforseen, accord-
ing to Cottam. The U.S. backed
overthow of Mossadeq in Iran was
ultimately responsible for the Kho-
meini regime. (Dr. Mossadeq was
president of Iran from 1951 to I953,
when he was replaced by the Shah
Reza Pahlavi.)

“The destabilization which the
Israeli invasion caused could bring
down other Arab regimes which
may be replaced by sectarian reli-
gious regimes like;the one in Iran,"
Cottam said.

The Iranian government has con-
sistently said the battle ends in Jer-
usalem._ According to Cottam, if
new religious regimes appear and
join forces with Iran, the consequen-
ces could be disastrous for Israel.

While Nossen said he person-

Counter-force weapons, missiles
aimed at other missiles, are destab-
lizing, and if the United States con-
tinues such strategies, it will
jeopardize security instead of equal-
izing it, according to Pitt physics
professor Raymond Willey.

He explained that destabilizing
effects will be the result if the U.S. or
the U.S.S.R. believes that its mis-
siles_can be destroyed by a first-
strike weapon because a state of
nervousness is likely. As a result, the
threatened countryimay opt for
launch-on-warning systems——

,systems that make the decision to
launch missiles before the individual
can act. '

Willey sipokeyesterday on “See-
ing the MX in Technical and Non-
Technical Terms“ before the Pitt

‘ Arms Race Study Group. The group

meets every Tuesday in Pitt's Eng-
lish department to discuss various

aspects of nuclear war. He was asked '

to speak after his letter responding
to an editorial favoring the MX plan
appeared in the Post-Gazette.

“-People experience frustration
and apathy due to their conceived or,
misconceived" notions about the
technical aspects of the issue,” Wil-

ley said. He admitted that there are '

undeniably technical complexities
surrounding the issue of nuclear
weapons, but added that questions
can be posed simply and clearly, and
the answers can be given in the same
way.

Discussing the MX missile con-
troversy, Willey explained that three
factors come into play when consid-
ering counter-force weapons and
strategy. Those factors are hardness

of the target, accuracy of the missile
and destructive power.

Hardness refers to the/amount of —

pressure a target can withstand,
according to Willey. For instance,
he explained, if missile A is in a silo
and missile B is attacking the silo,
then how many pounds of pressure
per square inch are needed to de-
stroy the silo is the question to
consider.

Willey said that there are 14.7
pounds per inch squared in the
atmosphere. An average-sized house
would be crushed into rubble if the
atmosphere_were only a few pounds
over pressure. In comparison, he
added that the effects of a nuclear
blast would increase pressure by
approximately 2,000 pounds per
square inch.

Accuracy is a factor that depends
on the weapons destructiveness,
according to Willey. 0

“After much testing, it is known
that at least one half of American
missiles are accuratelwithin a dis-
tance of 1,000 to 500 meters. “Soviet

missiles," he said, “have an accuracy '

of 300 meters.”

The final factor, destructiveness,
depends on the blast distance from
the structure, according to Willey.
As the distance increases, the de-
structive power decreases. The
source of power lies in a series of

chemical reactions.

The technical complexities that
surround all aspects of the nuclear
weapons debate need to be
simplified. '

“Most people,” Willey said, “are
either frightened of the complex
questions or have been told that they
can't understand them.” Willey said
in a later interview that he agreed
that this misconception must be

combatted, but added that he did
not have a solution.
“There is a saying that applies

- here,” he said. “A longjourney starts

with a single step.”

He explained that questions con-
cerning accuracy and the solid con-
cepts of strategy are important
questions, but even more crucial
questions must be considered. These
he leaves to the theorists, the politi-
cians and the theologians.

As a physics professor, however,
Willey said that he agrees that the
scientist does have some responsibil-
ity for his actions.

“The scientists create the
knowledge—they also have to dis-
seminate the information to the pub-
lic,” he said. Citing the number of
times that scientists have appeared
before Congressional Committees
to testify, Willey said that some poli-
ticians do listen to what the scientists
have to say. “But,” he added, “our
views on policy, of course, don't
hold much weight.”

Part of the public education about
the issues is already taking. place
because of the fierce debate over the
MX missile, according to Willey.

“People are getting stirred up, and
when public opinion is aroused,” he
explained, “it can do something.”

For example, Willey said that
public opinion in reaction to Super
Sonic Transport (SST) was what
stopped its success,‘ in addition to
concerns that the plan was too
costly. Another example is the Anti-
Ballistic Missile plan that was
scrapped by the Pentagon after’ it
was persuaded that the plan was not
feasible.

“Concern over the MX missile has
heightened,” Willey said, “and it is
conceivable some good will come of
this, in that people are learning
about the issues.” \ ~-

The corporate gifts that the uni-
versity received provide significant
support for professorships, fellow-
ships in business administration and
engineering, programs in industrial
medicine, international studies and
fellowships, the University Honors
Program and programs in energy,
according to Koperek.

“The support from the private sec-

we’re not receiving it by sitting on
our hands-it takes a lot of work.’

“The LRB is just now starting to
process (our charge),” Scheid said.
“The charge involves a number of
people. We're alleging that the uni-
versity committed an unfair labor
practice because it discriminated
against employees for their union
activities."

Scheid said the board would nor-
mally deal with the national LRB,
4ut since book store employees “are
technically state employees,” the
state LRB‘was contacted instead.

An agent from the state LRB will
eventually come to Pitt and take
affidavits from both sides involved.

Pitt officials have yet to speak with ‘
anyone, including the media, on the ‘

controversial matter.

“Once the agent gets here,“ Scheid
added, “Pitt will not stone‘-./“Ail it.”
Besides wanting to barg-. n for
better wages and beneﬁts, in. book
store employees are also seek- .1g to
better their working conditions.
"The stockroorn is in deplorable
condition,” Sciullo said. “Doors or
-{ioards are stacked on concrete
blocks that have collapsed on
employees in the past.” ‘
“When trucks pull up in the back
to the loading docks, there are also a

‘lot of carbon monoxide fumes that
seep in. It's caused a lot of nausea,
eye irritations and headaches."

According to Sciullo, fire doors
are deadbolted and barred everyday
at 5 p.m. while he might still be back
in the stockroom. He also said there
is no escape procedure, in the event
of an emergency, at the Book
Center.

Pinpointing his status at the book
store, Scuillo said he sees himself as
a marked man. He says that he was
stationed, in the book store stock-
room so that he is always in view of a
nearby TV camera. He also said that
his supervisor makes frequent trips
to Sciullo‘s area. 0

“They know people listen to me,”
Sciullo continued. “I tell you, I’ve
given my life to Pitt. I went from a
student-person (he’s a 1980 gradu-
ate) to a staff-person and have even
thought of ways for (the book store)
to save money"

“All they’re concerned with is

‘politics.’ They don’t care about

work, only the amount of dues you
pay.”

Sciullo said that he was not
elected to be a speaker for the
employees. He said he also doesn't
want to give the “impression that

represented."

“l‘ve sat around too long seeing
bad things happen to good people,"
he said. “Many of the employees are
afraid..—,_.especially.the older people.
They’ve seen a lot of people rolled
over; just like what's just recently
happened to Chuck (Delaney) and
Tim (Brady)."

When his supervisors ask to see
him on any matter, Sciullo said, he
often feels intimidated. He said there
will be two supervisors there so that
“it's two on one. I can't even bring
someone else in with me.”

Yesterday, Sciullo received the
results of his grievance file with Pitt.
It was rejected, he said, because he_
was suspended for “just cause."

“They (Pitt) cited my perform-
ance appraisals as being subjective.
There is only one way to cite my
performances in the past and that’s

through my supervisors.”

“lt’s all a personality clash,” Sci-
ullo added. “lt’s management back-
ing management. There is no doubt
in my mind what_is going 0'.

which way the wind is blowing.”

The supervisers were unavailable

Grievance  

The recent ﬂurry of interest in the Pitt Book Center
has brought to light a number of shocking claims
about working conditions there. The stories are more
reminiscent of a 19th century sweatshop than a 20th
century university.

Most compaints have centered around disciplinary
methods used by bookstore management. Employees
have been fired or suspended without prior warning,
explanations, or prompt and direct notification of
their status. Still other accounts have mentioned sub-
standard health and safety conditions and instances of
employees being disciplined for refusing overtime.

Each one of these complaints, taken separately,
represents a serious charge against the Book Center's
management which, if true, demands a quick remedy.
In this case, however, the claims are difficult to separ-
ate. As several employees have pointedout, each detail

can be fitted with dismaying ease into_ a picture of .

management attempts to forestall union organization.

Former bookstore employees Chuck Delaney and
Tim Brady suspect that their firings and the suspen-
sion of other workers were related to their efforts to
organize a union. The university, in a painfully brief
statement, has denied that its actions were directed
against union-organizing efforts. Yet according to the
only accounts available, the two ﬁred workers were at
the forefront of the union supporters and were neither
notified in person of their terminations not told the
reasons for that action., ‘

Under these circumstances, the conclusion that the
Book‘ Center management acted to quell unionization
efforts is nearly inescapable. That kind of mangement
activity would be particularly shocking at the book-
store, where reportedly poor working conditions give
employees clear reasons to seek union representation.

Whether .or not unionization was behind the disci-
plinary actions at the bookstore, that operation clearly
has a long way to go in respecting the dignity of its
workers. Among other actions, the Book Center
should set out a clear discipline policy which requires
warning before more severe‘ measures, such as suspen-
sion, are taken and which requires an explanation for
every disciplinary action. With such a policy in place,
the management should stick to it. 

Second, the university should look carefully into the
claims of poor health and safety conditions affecting
workers at the bookstore. Finally, the bookstore
should ‘put an end to such practices . as requiring
employees to work overtime.

These. suggested measures are not unusual in their
scope. They encompass no‘ more than what every 20th
century worker has the right to expect.

Letters To The Editor     

Baffled By NATO Column 

Dear Editor: -

Scott Rex’s article (“Reduced,

U.S. Role Would Strengthen:
NATO,” Jan. 19), while somewhat
interesting, is inconsistent, .simplis-
tic, and in some cases, downright
bafﬂirrg. 3-
To begin with, Rex betrays his
ignorance of Germany history in his
attempt to parallel alliance diplo-

,macy in the l870s to the current

situation in Europe. Contrary to
Rex’s impressions, Bismarck’s poli-
cies were not “inconsistent." It is
clear not that the German chancellor
was working from the fundamental
assumption that to divide is to rule.
The success of this strategy points
not to inconsistency but careful and
balanced statesmanship.

Second, Caprivi’s decision not to
pursue his predecessor’s policies was
not because “it was much easier to
take sides...than to live with incon-
sistencies,” but resulted instead from
domestic pressure from Bismarck’s
critics.

And it gets worse. Rex’s conten-
tion that “had Roosevelt lived, Ger-

\

Administrative Charade 

Dear Editor:

In commenting upon your
November editorial on faculty e-
valuation, I set in motion a chain of
commentary. While I did not wholly
agree with Ann Marie Freggens’
support of my position (Jan. l2).

many might not have been carved
into East and West sections” borders
on the absurd; and his statement
that “FDR died and that was his
biggest mistake" achieves that du-
bious honor with unequaled ease.
As the essay continues, Rex con-
fuses me all the more. He states that
“the West does not need...the crying
of unilateralists pleaing for a world
without nuclear weapons." But why
is that? Rex doesn't bother to say.
Rex also contends that “it is time
that we begin to restructure the
NATO alliance. Serious attempts
should be made by our government
to correct the long-range problems
which face NATO.” But what are
these long-range problems?” The
nature of the Soviet threat? Differ-
ing perceptions among the alliance
as to whatform that threat takes and
how to respond to it‘? If Rex had
bothered to give serious thought to
his statement, he might have recog-
nized that it is this very question as
to the problems facing NATO and
their consequences which lies at the
root of alliance disagreement.
Finally, Rex states that “it’s time

Grace Lazovik’s response (Jan. 21)
cannot stand unchallenged. In
attacking Freggens’ “inaccurate
assumptions and conclusions,"
Lazovik leaves out some items that
should be mentioned. I note at the

‘ outset that Lazovik and I have had

some friendly, if brief, debates on

Airbands Deflated  

Dear Editor:

I have seen your recent classi-
fied ads concerning an upcoming
airband competition here at Pitt.
According to the advertisement,
this contest is being sponsored by
the Pitt Program Council, an
organization that in the past has
supplied us with some intelligent
forms ofentertainment. Since we
know the PPC is capable of
organizing quality programs, I
question the presence of such a
useless activity as an airband
contest. is there no more con-
structive way to spend the time '

and money?"

For those who do not know
what an airband is, a group of
people dress like a rock-and-roll
group and lip-sync to the group's
recorded music! Now, honestly
folks, we are in college! This
newspaper has already shown
itself to have a mature, intelligent
viewpoint concerning the place
of today's decadent music styles
in our society. Is it too much to
ask the same ofthe organizers of

this ridiculous airband contest?

is he talking about? On the one

hand, he argues for strengthening .-

NATO through a reduced Americ I“
role, (which seems to connote the
exact opposite of a “shedding of
neo-isolationism”) and on the other
hand, he’d like to see the U.S.
actively pursuing detente with the
U.S.S.R. (Is that his idea ofjettison-
ing this notion of isolation?) Given
his earlier construction of isolation-
ism, I am thoroughly confused. I
suggest that Rex recheck not only
his history but also the traditional
meanings of some of the terms he
employs.

I do think that Rex’s attempt to
deal with a pressing problem is
admirable. But I also believe that he
might have been more successful if
he used the opinion page less as 
forum for spouting rhetoric and x ~53

The Pitt News, Wednesday January 26, 1983

By KATHERIKNE M. BEZAK

A recent poll indicates that the
majority of voting Americans do
not want Ronald Reagan to seek

‘a second term as president.
Many believe that Reagan is no
longer in control of his adminis-
tration, cannot manage his staff,
is unable» to make rati_onal deci-
sions and in short, has finally
succumbed to political burn-out.

Perhaps true, yet surely those
. polled (from the truly needy to
the obscenely wealthy) will miss
the presence of this loveable sto-
ryteller in the White vHouse.
Though not a great leader, Rea-
gan has helped to add class to the
increasingly imperial presidency,
and this task remains uncom-
pleted. Unless Americans wish
the White House to once again
lose credibility with hostesses all
over Georgetown, and surely
they do not, the Reagans must
remain in Washington. There is
an obvious solution to this
dilemma.

The man who, eons ago, was
voted to have the most perfect
physique of all the actors in Hol-
lywood should immediately don
his tuxedo, call a press confer-
ence and announce that his wife
Nancy will run for president in
1984. Woodrow Wilson’s wife
took over his duties as president
when he was ill; surely Nancy will
do the same for her husband
while he revitalizes white‘ tie
dinnersvand helps to ease the ills
of the upper classes.

Nancy should have little trou-
ble at the Republican Conven-
tion. Politically astute delegates
will realize that nominating a
woman for president might end
accusations by some irate Ameri- _
cans that the party,‘ by not sup-
porting the Equal Rights.
Amendment, believes women are
subservient to men. Gazing at
Mrs. Reagan standing proudly
on her pedestal, everyone will

,ing collections of New York

"purchased for her husband’s

‘with his pseudo-majestic pres-

"ft

realize that she could not'possi-
bly be subservient to anyone.

V Voters will support her candi-
dacy because they know that
Nancy has to be at least as adept
at foreign and domestic policy as
her husband, and even more
polite. She would never point at
a person and tell him to shut up.
Especially when the cameras are
on.

In the tastefully redecorated
Oval Office, President Nancy
Reagan will consult future Secre-
tary of State Bill Blass about-
matters of crucial importance,
such as nuclear disarmament, '
Japanese steel imports, Social
Security regulations and upcom-

City’s- hottest fashion designers
while her husband graces the
Red Room, impressing visitors,
with his overstated regality. T

Mr. Reagan will act as a
charming host to visiting digni-
taries and foster grandparents
while wife Nancy keeps the dis-
tinguished guests at bay with the
“teeny tiny little” gun that she

1980 presidential campaign.
World-weary Ronald Reagan
will no longer have to defend
multi—million dollar working
vacations to taxpayers—he can
finally relax with the beautiful xi
people and let the Missus worry
about the feasibility of a limited
nuclear war in Europe.

Ronald Reagan is a useful
ornament for the Right Wing;
suave and charming, he certainly
adds more class to the White
House than a certain peanut
farmer who preceded him. If he is
to complete his task, he must
remain at 1600 Pennsylvania
Avenue, though not as president.
Let him decorate .the grounds

ence, let him stage occasional
press conferences in order to stay
in the public eye, let him pose for
the photographers of G.Q., and
let Nancy do the rough stuff.

With the retirement of Wesley W.
Posvar, the University of Pittsburgh.
is left without a chancellor. Realiz-
ing the urgency of the situation,
Socrates, wearing his best outfit
with matching sandals, decides to
apfoly for the job.

Looking at the imposing oak door
with the gold letters thatspelt “The
Board of Trustees," Socrates
knocked once and strode boldly into
the room. ’

“The sauna is on the bottom
floor,” shouted someone from
within the huge cloud ofcigar smoke
that hung over the table.

“Sauna...I’ve come to apply for
the job of chancellor,” replied
Socrates. '

“Get lost.” _

“But listen to my credentials, I’ll

4*-be a great chancellor,” Socrates said

addressing the cloud.

“Go ahead,” the cloud said, then
whispered, “It’ll be good for a
laugh."

“Well, I have been in charge ofa
school before’, called the Thinkery.
We always stressed learning.”

“,What?” asked the cloud.

“Learning,” repeated Socrates.
“Hopefully the student received a
nice broad education, lots of philo-
sophv. logic....”

“What did you charge the student
for this ‘education?’ "

“Charge?” ‘ I
- “Sure, tuition, late fees, activity
fees, etc.” the cloud said.

“Tuition fees?"

“Sure, how else can you ‘make a
profit?" said the cloud surprised at-
the applicant’s ignorance. I

“Well, in my school we weren’t
concerned with profits as much as
with giving a good education and
creating a good atmosphere for
learning.”

“Well, you’re obviously not a
good chancellor for Pitt. That’s not

\the type of atmosphere we try to

create here," snapped the cloud.

“Why not?” I

“Because this institution is com-
mitted to the dollar and profits.
What does atmosphere have to do
with profits, except make profits
smaller. And if you’re not prepared
to increase the profits and act like a

businessman, then you're not for‘

us!”

“But I thought you wanted a
leader for the school...someone to
make it a better place. Maybe
increase teachers or get better ones,”
explained Socrates, “or improve
dorm food, ‘refinish the torture
chambers.”

“That’s Towers," snapped the
cloud. “All those improvements cost

money. Too much money. And
besides, who cares about those petty
things. In fact, we're just about to
cut back on expenses.”

.“Cut back! I thought you were
making profits. Why cutbacks?"

“Why- not?", the cloud joked,.

“The more _money the better. A
penny saved is a penny earned. Like
the geography department, we
earned some pennies there.”

“But a university is not supposed
to be concerned about money. It's
supposed to teach and create an

atmosphere for learning," argued I

Socrates. _ .

“Nonsense. You’re in a dream
world,” the cloud retorted. “Now.
will you leave already. Wevhave to go
to our next interview and applicant.
He knows how to make cuts and
how to stretch a dollar. He'll make

us even bigger profitsthan Posvar ._

did!" ,
“Who is this person anyway? Can

I meet him also?" Socrates asked.
“No, now go home," the cloud

said, forming into a dollar sign and

ﬂying out the window.

Intrigued, Socrates walked up to i

the empty board table and peeked
inside the applicant’s folder. The
application had four gold stars and a
stamp of approval if the candidate
would accept. The candidate was

one respond to this statement with-
out “knowledge" of the “subject

As to “inspiring confidence,” this
is indeed a touchy area. Many sug-

an experienced actor, is a “great
communicator” who convinces the
public that he understands the
speeches he delivers, even when he
does not. Such questions unwit-

Who ’s Killing Capitalism ?

By JOHN TRENTES

In a tiny office tucked away in the
corner of an abandoned Pittsburgh
warehouse, the editor sat hunched
over his typewriter. He was just an

ordinary looking man, you under- .

stand, not what you might expect of
someone with the entire Marxist
press of an American city under his
thumb. No‘ red ﬂags graced the
room; no hammer-and-sickle insig-
nia hung from the door. In fact, the
stark illumination provided by a sin-
gle naked light, bulb revealed a
rather ordinary, dingy little office
with various newspaper articles
tacked to the walls and piles of pap-
ers scattered on the floor. A knock
came on the frosted glass window of
his office door. ' I ’

“Come in, it's open.”

“You requested my presence,
comrade?”

The man at the door shifted from
foot to foot nervously as he removed
his red plaid hunting jacket and
carefully placed his stack of crimson
newspapers on the floor.

“Comrade Smith, it has unfortu-
nately come to my attention that you
have only managed to sell three
newspapers this week. Perhaps you
can explain why?” .

P “Comrade Editor, it is well known
that I have only the highest respect

; for our ideals, for our newspaper

and for you, but it seems that we are
not being so well received.”

“What do you mean, Comrade'\
Smith? Explain.” V

“Well, I’ve been standing out in
front of the library trying to sell our
glorious newspaper. People con-
tinued to walk right by me no matter
how much I harassed them. You
must understand that I made the
utmost effort to sell the papers. I
even tried following them for a
whole block, waving them wildly in
their faces."

“And what
comrade?”

“Well, one compared my breath
with the odor of several species of
animals. Then one remarked that I
ought to go to a street corner in
Poland and try to sell them._ Yet
another proposed that I roll my pa-
pers into a cylinder and do unspeak-
able things to myself with them.”

did they do,

“What are you getting at, Com-
rade Smith?”

“I’ve been having the feeling that
nobody wants us here.”

“Preposterous! Without us, who

’ would be left to combat the malig-

nant spread of capitalism?”
“Oh, comrade, for this I very for-
tunately have an answer.” '
The newspaper salesman reached
into his pouch and produced

another, rather different newspaper.

The editor” realized with a start that

it was rather bland looking; it was
-merely black and white.‘ Why, it was
a capitalist newspaper!

“Comrade Smith! Don’t tell me
that you’ve been reading capitalist
propoganda!”

“But, comrade editor, look at
what it says on the front page. See
what the president is doing for the
country.”

The editor obligingly accepted the
monochromatic tabloid and began
to study it. Slowly, his expression
changed from one of disdain and
disgust to one of rapture and joy.
Finally, he placed it quietly over top
of his typewriter. He stared straight
at the salesman.

“Do you realize what this means,
Comrade Smith?”

“Yes, I do, comrade editor.”

“It means that we’re wasting our
time here. We must cease publica-
tion at once.”

“Cease publication, comrade?
Why?"

“I had originally believed that we
were the chosen ones to destroy cap-
italism in this country.”

“Yes?”

The editor slowly leaned back
from‘ his desk and smiled broadly.
U “I can seethat Iwas wrong."

tingly reinforce the charismatic
charlatan; the Rev. James Jones
doubtless would look good on this

count. No ratings are trustworthy,-

high or low.

Lazovik makes much of the need
for “anonymity,” using the inap-
propriate. example of anonymous
peer reviews of research manuscripts
and grant applications. I think it can
be shown that the organizational
environments of peer reviews and
teacher evaluations are quite differ-
ent. In her published work, Lazovik
compares the results of evaluations
administered by instructors them-
selves with those administered by
“neutral individuals” (members of
OET). She concludes that “neutrally
administered evaluations” are more
accurate because they always result
in lower ratings. This logic deserves
further analysis.

0 The evaluation administrator is
‘not “neutral,” but is a representative

.of higher authority. An analogous

9

example is the famous “obedience’
experiments done by Stanley Mil-
gram. Experimental subjects were
asked to administer punishment
(electric shocks) to those who dis-
obeyed instructions by failing to
memorize word lists. Subjects were
more willing to administer the pun-
ishment when the other person was
out of sight in another room. The
environment encourages students to
deliver punishment.

'0 This type of research, or-evalua-
tion administration, begins with an
‘underlying premise that in any
group (faculty in this case), there is
always something of a “natural dis-
tribution” (some great, some aver-
age, some lousy), and the
researcher‘s/evaluator’s task is to
adjust questionnaire’ and environ-
ment until the distribution emerges
as a “self-fulfilling prophecy." The
analogies here are “grading on a
curve” and “forced distribution” of
performance appraisals (as in the
recently enacted civil service
reform).

0 It follows that if one organiza- .

tional environment (instructor is
present) “influences” the ratings, it is

silly to claim that a second organiza-

/

3

tional environment (“neutral admin-
istrator”) does not “influence” the

ratings. Lazovik should re-examine ‘

the logic which leads to the conclu-
sion that the lowest ratings always
are the correct ones. This is not
“neutrality,” but a conscious effort
to secure lower ratings.

As a serious student seeking to
integrate her experiences elsewhere
with what is happening here, Freg-
ge_ns deserved more considerate
treatment. Even if I would disagree
with her, I see no reason to use one
of the more condescending tech-
niques in the hands‘ of “experts.”

It will not do to assert that those
who exhibit agreement with the
expert (in this case, student govern-
ment) are “mature,” thereby imply-
ing that any who disagree’ ‘are
“immature.” True, organizations are
designed in something of a parent-

child design; when a subordinate 

questions a superior, this can then be
interpreted as childishness. Despite
their protestations, university peo'_—
ple often seem ”unable to move
beyond this behavior pattern.

The administrators who pursue
the expansion of faculty evaluations
are as well-intentioned as students
who believe them highly useful, and
as highly motivated as was Jimmy
Carter when he proposed civil ser-
vice reform. Indeed, it is a center-
piece of our theories of organization
that employees will do better work

only if they are constantly threat- ‘
ened with salary cuts or dismissal. ’
When this premise is connected.

with “scientific method," the result is
a “systematic” search for “bad
actors,” ultimate “success" being
defined as an increase in the number
of people identified as “incompe—
tent.” We are only at the beginning

of this effort now; if you want a look‘

at the future of the campus, take a

look at contemporary civil sevice [

morale.

The administrative charade ulti-
mately will be tragically amusing;
the costs of evaluating theentire
faculty will be quite high, to be bal-
anced by larger classes and faculty

‘ dismissals.

I By corms FERRIS

The Semester at Sea (SAS)
program is a learning option
offered to Pitt students of sopho-
more status or better as a sup-
plement to the usual college
education. However, it is much
more than just a supplement.

“What is learned aboard a ship

is much different than what is

learned on a land campus,” said

Dr. Patrick Doreian, professor

‘ of sociology.'“Learning is much
more intense.”

For example, students may be
studying the poverty—stricken

' areas of southern Indonesia, but

rather than seea film about
them, they actually walk‘ the
streets themselves.

“To be studying a particular
culture and to live among the
people_for a few days is certainly
an unforgettable experience,”
according to Alisa Casper, a‘
-S.A.S. junior. ‘ '

Inspired from her recent expe-
rience, Casper, an English writ-
ing major, is now looking into
Asian studies, in addition to

-.learning foreign languages such
as Spanish and Japanese.

Some 425 - students began
their 100-day journey when they
left port in Seattle, on Sept. 14,

’ .1982 and returned to America on

_Dec. 23, 1982.

Countries they visited include
Japan, Indonesia, Taiwan, Hong
Kong, Sri Lanka, India, Egypt,
Turkey, Greece, Morocco and

. Spain. They stayed in each coun-

try for approximately three days.

Once in port, each student
was immediately on his own.

j“l really learned how to be self-
sufficient,” Casper said.

Many students would travel
hundreds of miles in various
directions, exploring and living
among the people. Unless stay-
ing close to port, students rarely

slept on the boat when docked. V

Youth hotels are located all
around the world to shelter and
sometimes feed traveling stu-
dents for just a few dollars.
(There is one located here in
Pittsburgh). '

Students often traveled by

‘train from_ city to city, and as a

result. slept while traveling.

Many times, -a student is
invited to stay with someone he
,met in a particular country.
Casper said that, in Egypt, she.

\

and three friends were invited to
stay with a family who noticed
they were American students
and offered to show them their
country.

This is an immediate differ-
ence between countries—how
many Americans are willing to
invite strangers into their homes
for two days?

This did not just take place in
Egypt, but in every country.
Natives were more than willing
to be “tour guides” for the
students. .

One reason for this is that
many people overseas love
Americans, and they also get the
chance to practice their English.

“It’s so exciting to be able to
actually live with people from
that certain culture, see things as
they see them and to be able to
sit down and _eat the food they’re
eating,” Casper said.

Credits are obtained through
this excursion. Classes are actu-
ally held aboard ship. They are
held sixdays a week, and each

day is divided into either an “A”
‘ "class day or a “B” class day.

“Teaching aboard ship is both-

demanding and difficult, yet it is
very rewarding," Doreian said.

For example, Doreian taught
three courses in sociology using
textbooks and resource books
as background.

His wife, Dr. Esther Sales", also
a faculty member at Pitt, partici-

, pated in the Semester At Sea

program.

Teaching had to be very
ﬂexible—coping with sea sick-
ness was an ever present reality.
As far as grading was concerned,
Doreian tried to grade “as nor-
mal as possible” under the
circumstances‘

In Casper’s opinion, studying
aboard ship was relatively easy.
She spent many hours studying
in the ship’s well-stocked library.

E ‘.-‘The anticipation of studying
about a country you'll be seeing
in a couple of-days is unreal,” she
said.

Culture shock is something
that Casper, like so many other
students, suffered upon return-
ing to America.

The street dwellers of Bom-
bay, India, had a tremendous

.effect upon her. She recalled

how sorry she felt for the families
she saw living in little cardboard

I huts with no clothes and further

 S.A.S.: Sailing Through

down the street, a group of fami-
lies without even huts.

-“Itwent from worse to worse,”
she said.

The culture shock struck
upon returning to America,
where money is spent on expen-
sive clothing, video games and
everything else imaginable.

Another aspect of culture
shock comes with the attitude
that we, as Americans, possess.
According to Casper, we think

America is the best, the people.

are the nicest, and our way of
doing things is “right”, but to go
abroad and experience other
cultures is the onlyway to see
that there are alternatives.

“Seeing how people stereotype
other people isa shame,” Casper
said. “We tend to categorize
everyone. But on this trip I saw
that the world did not consist of
categories, but ofindividual peo-
ple seemingly after the same,
goal of peace.”

She said that she feels very
changed because she grew up
very quickly in those l0OAdays.

“Being here in_ Pittsburgh is

’ not what life is all about. I feel 25

instead of 20.”

Like Casper, Doreian said that
he was changed.

“I know much more, yet I feel
much more ‘ignorant of how
much I don't know.“ he said:

He now sees our culture as
being uptight.

He called traveling in general a
broadening experience ‘because it
permits cornparisons ofhis coun-

'try’s positio‘n to that of other

countries.

One big advantage of going on
Semester At Sea is that no one is
subjected to organized tours.

In a related incident, Doreian
recalls an I-ndonesian dance
called the Ramayama. He saw

I the dance done in a little neigh— ‘

borhood theater, noticing the
audience participation. Later, he
went to a hoteland saw the same
dancefdone Las Vegas style. He
was able to see the dance as both.
a native and a tourist.

Doreian and Casper stressed

" that the Semester At Sea is a very

individual experience whereby
each person will ‘gain something
unique.

Semester At Sea can be obtained

the

Nationality .

  Rooms

The Nationality Rooms at the
University of Pittsburgh have
brought national acclaim to the uni-
versity. They are expressions of
timeless human values and repre-
sent the dream of chancellor John
G. Bowman back in 1926.

These rooms have been an inspi-
ration to those who have studied in
and visited them, but there are
many students attending this uni-
versity who have not taken advan-
tage of the opportunity to see these F
remarkably crafted rooms.

Much planning had to be done
after Bowman decided to create the
classrooms that would later repre-
sent aspects of our heritage and
nationalities from around the globe.

The work began in the communi-
ties of Allegheny County as men,‘
women and children from many
organizations worked to help
finance these roooms.

This enthusiasm spread across
the nation, where committees were
formed to assist in the planning. The
government also responded, pro-
viding architects,.artists, monetary
giftsand materials to assure authen-
ticity in these classrooms.

The Nationality Rooms, along
with_the Cathedral of Learning and
Commons Room, have been desig-
nated historic landmarks of
Pittsburgh.

The Nationality Rooms, located
on the first floor of the the Cathedral.
of Learning, are numerous. There
are 19 rooms and five more in the
planning stages, said Maxine
Bruhns, director of the Nationality
Rooms and Intercultural Exchange
Programs. The rooms in the plan-
ning stages‘ include African Herit-'
age, Armenian, Australian, Israel
Heritage and Ukranian Rooms.

All 19 rooms enrich the university
communityand are worth visiting-
There are guided tours by reserva-
tion and taped tours that do not ‘
require reservations.

The Chinese classroom was
inspired by a palace hall in Peiping’s
Forbidden City and is dedicated to
the memory of'Confucius and his
democratic idea of classless educa-
tion, styled after 18th century
architecture. "

Stone lions ﬂank the entrance and

‘on the painted ceiling coils the

golden “Imperial Dragon of the Uni-

verse” surrounded by clouds, den- ‘

oting nature’s energy and freedom.
In the center of the room stands

ya.

the “moon table,” built of teakwood, ' '

where students and teacher sit at
the same level. The frosted glass

‘ windows also enhance the tranquil-

ity of this Eastern atmosphere.

This room was dedicated on Oct.
6, 1939, designed _by Teng Kwei of
Peipingand Henry Killam Murphy,
architect.

The Early American Room, still

‘being furnished, is a descendant,

nine generations removed, of an
English claptain, according to
Bruhns.

The room is of a New England
colonial style from the 17th century.
It is done in the kitchen-living room
setting of the early colonists, chosen
to portray the sturdy simplicity of
the era.

The major focus of the room is a
nine-foot fireplace_ with “fixings,”
such as a log hook, iron kettles, a
bread shovel, ladies and forks.

The pine beams’ used in the
seven-foot high ceiling were col-

lected after a careful search in

Massachusetts.

A small closet between the black-
board and fireplace contains a
secret panel that leads to a hidden
staircase. ‘

It is believed that colonial women
and children could take refuge there
if danger threatened- This room was
presented in 1938 by architect
Theodore H. Bowman.

The French Classroom is styled
after the French Empire of the 19th
century. The walls‘of soft gray are
capped by bronze gold-leafed capi-
tals bearing decorative designs.

’ Sparkling crystal chandeliers and
golden damask draperies accent the
room. The student chairs of«maho-

— gany are covered with light blue

cloth of directoire design.

A subtle touch of refinement is
lent by the satiny surface of the
blackboard, made of glass. This
room was dedicated Jan. 23, 1943.
Jacques Carlu of Paris was the
architect.

  The UnknownTradition

Quo Vadis. The name means
“whither goest thou?” It’s Latin,
and it is the name of the student
organization that conducts tours
of the Pitt Nationality Rooms.

The tour service began in the
1940s when the first rooms had
been dedicated. Only men were
hired to give tours. During
World War II, Helen Rush, who
was then the dean of women stu-
dents, saw that there was a great
potential for developing a
women’s organization for social
service by learning and interpret-
ing the rooms for visitors. Quo
Vadis was established.

Finally, men were permitted to

V _ become members. Since\then,

‘ \

._- ** '~,
X K

"any student who is interested in
the rooms-and is willing to volun-
teer his time as a service to the
university is eligible. .

Kevin Glass, president of Quo
Vadis, explained the appeal and
interest that he felt was the core
of the group.

“I joined because I felt that giv-l

ing tours wouldihelp me with
interaction with groups of peo-
ple,” he said.

“After joining, I found the eth-
nic art and history behind the
classrooms was very in-
teresting.” ' .

When asked what he most‘
, _ liked about being a guide, Glass _
‘.1. _,..[said, ‘‘I enjoy meeting people
from many parts of the world_

and learning of their different
lifestyles and the information
that they have about the rooms.”

Over. the years, the group has
changed many times to develop
into the group it is today.

The guide service has seen

thousands -of visitors each year
and has also entertained ambas-
sadors, dignitaries and other for-
eign’ visitors. With these many
different visitors came many dif-
ferent types of leadership.
, When it first began, Quo
Vadis had no official leader and
most training was done by stu-
dents themselves.

In 1966, E. Maxine Bruhns
came to the university and was
involved with the Office of Cultu-
ral and Educational Exchange.

' While there was still a clean of

women. Martha Anderson, the "

oz, .,

assistant dean, began to help out
-with Quo Vadis.

With, Bruhns, Anderson wrote
the script for a slide presentation
of the rooms. Anderson also
helped out with the training of
the guides for the first time.

Another adviser came and.
went, but not much time was
spent with the group. Shortly
after, the Office of Cultural and
Educational Exchange was
divided, and ‘Bruhns became the
first official director of Quo
Vadis.

With the first director came
the first official adviser. Diana
Zorich, who had been -a guide
herself,
adviser to the group.

She expanded the slide pre-
sentation and collected vast
amounts of original materials on
the rooms, which were used to
help create some of the training
materials which’ are used _
presently.

Today, the current adviser is
Christine Walsh, who is chang-
ing the group again. Walsh was

. never a guide and her position is
only part-time, which makes

things very different.

Her technique of augmenting
training involves more participa-
tion of group members with each
other. The older members of the
group give training and lend con-
structive criticism to the newer
members of the group.

Rather than have one trainer

:with each new trainee, Walsh
has implemented a program in

which each trainee takes tours
with several guides to get various
styles and presentations of tours
with several guides to get various
styles and_presentations of tours
and to impress the material on
his mind. Printed materials are
used in addition.

Although the style of training
varies with each adviser, one
thing remains the same—guides
must be trained thoroughly.

After completing study of all
the details of the 19 rooms, each
guide must demonstrate his or
her knowledge by giving an oral
tour to the adviser and taking a

lengthyvwritten examination.

I

became a full-time” .

The purpose_is not to alarm or

.. to criticize‘, but merely to assure

the _quality of the training and
that everyone has the facts
straight before he sets out on his
first tour.

Many people who are aware
that the group gives tours do not
realize the other activities in
which Quo Vadis participates.

Since it is a service‘ organiza-
tion, its members help host
many of the chancellor’s recep-
tions, such as the reception for
new students in the fall and the
reception for the Heinz Chapel
Choir at Christmas.

Along with university-affiliated ‘

affairs, members have the honor

-of meeting with the current

members of the individual com-
mittees of the rooms. ,

Quo Vadis is asked, at times,
to help host or usher at the
separate committee functions.

These are the “fun” activities
of the group, and although they
do not involve interpreting itself,
they bestow a type of honor and
pride on the members. '
' Besides the personal pride
and satisfaction that one gets
from being a member, what else
does the organization do?

“It opens many doors,” Walsh

said. “lt’s a learning experience ‘

in many ways. Besides being
trained in the rooms, it helps one
become more sensitive to other
cultures.

“There are also the Gillespie
Awards, ,given to two deserving
Quo Vadis guides each April
(paid trips to New York City to
learn of the cultural experiences
there and to visit and study the
guide service at the United
Nations) and the study-abroad
scholarships.” V

Part of that pride comes from

of dedication and hard work, but

there are requirements.

Each member must volunteer
two hours a week to take tours
and sit at the guide desk located
on the first floor of the Cathedral
of Learning.

He or she must also cover a
total of four volunteer weekend
hours per term and must partici-
pate in at least one special event,

’..

Tii.e,i1’itt ‘News. Wednesday Jdriudry  S  I I I I I

the   World

such as hosting one of ‘the
receptions.

It is often on the weekend
hours that a guide will meet the
most interesting people, from a
giggling pack of Girl Scouts to a

‘ group of senior citizens or a

number of families.

They never know who’s com-
ing, so they must be ﬂexible
enough to accommodateany or
-all of these in any one day or any
one group.

With the five new rooms being
planned and constructed on the
third ﬂoor of the Cathedral,
guides will soon have to imple-
ment tours on two ﬂoors,.while
keeping the tours as short as
possible (about one hour long).

“Perhaps we’ll have to split
tours when the third ﬂoor rooms
are opened,” Walsh said. “That”
will obviously be a big change
around here, in how we _do
things. I think it would be better
to have a full-time adviser again.
As it is now, there is less coordi-
nation of things. It’s hard to keep
the momentum going.”

\.

Keeping the momentum of the
group going may be a big prob-
lem, but the biggest problem by
far is that most students do not
know-what Quo Vadis is.

Larry Rapp, one of the newest
guides said, “I think it’s one of
the most unknown clubs in the
university.

“I brought my family from Bel- 

gium. We saw the English room
and I was very‘ impressed. I
wanted to get involved with the
rooms any way‘ I could, but I
didn’t know how. at first. A

“When I found out about Quo
Vadis, I signed up for it on every
sheet that came around at
orientation.” c -

Walsh agrees.'“I think our big-
gest problem is with recognition
and recruitment,” she said. “A
change I would like to have
happen is more recognition from
the university and the
chancellor.

“Also, I don’t think our name
means or says anything to out-
siders to the group. Maybe we
shouldluse the name and our
function together more. Perhaps
by_ this we could make ourselves

;

a more high-profile group, which 7’

is what we need. ‘
“We also need to stir the inter-
. est of students who are worried
about their studies. Some are

-afraid to commit themselves‘

because of it. It used ‘to be that,
at freshmen orientation, the
freshmen had to pick a ‘group
that they were interested in.-

After orientation changed,
recruitment did too. I think we
need a more thorough system,
especially for the incoming
freshmen.”

When asked if she thought if
there would ever be a time when
the group would again be with-‘
out an adviser, Walsh said, “If
the .university maintains this
position as only part-time, I sup-
pose the adviser could handle
the business ‘aspects of -the
group.
“The students would have to
learn to handle the activities,

such as meetings, fundraisers”

and so on. ‘Perhaps then the
adviser could become a tour
director or something to actually
book the tours, which the stu-
dents wouldn’t have time for.

“If my position stays as only
part-time, I think the group will
have to become more member-
directed to survive.”

With the five new rooms to
look forward to and all the
excitement they will bring, it
seems evident that all the
Nationality Rooms, and hence
Quo Vadis, will very soon be in
the spotlight again.‘

It is hoped that the enthusiasm
for the rooms and theguide ser-
vice that has been lacking for so
long will again be realized.

“It should always be empha- -

sized and should be in ever-
yone’s mind that the function of
the group is to interpret the
rooms, in their own particular
styles, to the groups who come
to visit and want to see them,”
Bruhns said.

:

Walsh summed up the feelings

of most of the, members of Quo .

Vadis.

“I think the organization will
survive as long as the rooms do,”
she said. “People are always
interested in them, and with the
expansion, there ‘will be more
demand.”

If you're interested in visiting
the Nationality Rooms, they are
open 9 a.m.-5 p.m. on weekdays
and 12:30-4:30 p.m. on week-
ends. Guides are available at
most times. For a tour, call Chris
Walsh at 624-6000. ‘ .

Groups and pre-booked tours
are encouraged, but walk-insgre
always welcome.

The ‘Nationality Rooms sponsor a gift’ shop in the

Cathedral.

J-‘Chipman, the end of the first half

3 Resurg

By scorr DELLETT ~

Despite some hot shooting by for-
ward Clyde Vaughan, the Panther

 ‘V-tgaasketball team was unable to re-

"eover from a 19-point deﬁcit and
lost. ‘at Boston College 68-63 last
night; "

19 of his 28 points in the second half,
including 14 Pitt. points in a row
when he single-handedly cut a 50-31
Boston lead to nine.

Eagle center John Garris was the
offensive star in the first half, scor-
ing 22 points in the first 20
—minutes—most1y inside— as Boston
College was able to penetrate the
1-3-1 Panther zone, shooting 64.2
percent in the first half. -

Pitt couldn’t handle the pl-2-2
zone, and the Panthers shot a mis-
erable 34.2 percent in the first half.

According to head coach Roy

was the key of the game. Pitt had the
ball and the opportunity to cut the
Boston College lead to ten points.
But a scramble after a George Allen

miss was where the Panthers lost the
ball with six seconds left. The Eagles
came down, and freshman forward
Roger McCready hit a shot at the
buzzer; Boston College went up by
14. -
' “We could have brought the lead
- down to nine or 10 points at the half,
but instead, we were down by .14,"
Chipman said at his post-game
show. “You can't do that in this
league. There are too many good
’ players." ' 
Things got worse for the Panthers
injthe beginning of the [second half.-
Garris hit a three-point play. A Jay
Murphy 20—footer gave the Eagles a
19-point lead. »

Besides Vaughan‘s shooting, sev-

eral adjustments at halftime helped
the Panthers generate offense and
keep the Boston College offense-
among the top five offensives in the

nation_—'to 23 points in the second ,

half. ,

“We run» the balloff the break
better,” Chipman said. “We were
getting the ball off the boards and
beating them down court.”

‘I

\

en CG 7

\ ' x

“We also went to a 2-2-1 zone

press and a 2-3 zone. Both defenses
seemed to bother them. I should
have gone to them a lot earlie‘r.‘3
Pitt kept on chipping at the lead in
the later part of the second half. Two
foul shots by guard, Joey David cut
the lead to 62-52 with 6: 18 left. Three

minutes later, Trent Johnson, who V

had 11 points and‘ 15 rebounds, hit a
three-point play to get the lead to
seven points. — V

But Vaughan fouled out with 1:53
left and the Pitt offense seemed to go
with him. Four consecutive _one-
and-one misses by Boston College
gave the Panthers several opportun-
ities to cut into the lead, but no one
was able to take charge. Pitt missed
two shots in the final minute.

“We can‘t find ‘people to hit that
key shot,“-Chipman said.
: -Chipman. was especially pleased
with J ohnson’s pla_y.Johns_on, along
with Culbertsonin the lineup, has
provided the Panthers with some

_ solid play.

iPan‘th_e'r gymnast Chris Femiani is oneot the reasons tor _Pitt’s success this season. j

 

By Cl-lARl.l.E O'HARA

Panther gy-nmast Chris F emiarii is
a team member who has been instru-
mental in the recent surgence of the
Panther gymnastics program.

The senior captain from Peters
Township, Pa., is an inspirational
leader to the group of gymnasts that
emerged undefeated from ‘its two
opening meets.

Duri 7 impressive victories over

316th-ran ed Illinois and 21st-

ranked North Carolina State, Femi-’
ani _made his presence felt by
winning the r_ings and vault competi-
tion against Illinois and the side
horse event against North Carolina
State. 7
Femiani is very optimistic about
the Panthers‘ chances this season.
“Three years ago we were probably
not even ranked in the Top 50. This
season we’re shooting for the Top
10,” he_saic_l. “I believe we are the
second best team in the east, behind
Penn State." -

/

Femiani began competing inthe ,.

ninth grade at Peters Township
High Schoo1,«and eventually became
a top recruit and drawing attention
from Penn State, Ohio State and

Pitt. ~

Femiani is more than just an,

exceptional gymnast. The English
writing and communications major

has earned.a 2.75 QPA during his

four years at Pitt. ‘ .
‘In regard to what it has taken’ to
become successful both academi-
cally andathletically, Femiani said,
“The first two years were rough. I
never studied so hard inmy life.
“The second two years have beeen
much different. I- have disciplined
myself _to the point where my school
workis done before I even go to
practice." .
This type of discipline has
impressed head coach Frank

,D’Amico,' who named Femiani as

captain.

Cristen Zaleski was ‘being -re- 

cruited by the Lady Panther swim
team-—as a manager._

“I like a manager to have a know-
ledge of swimming,” coach David
Beiowich said. ‘‘I wanted Cristen to
replace Debbie Bruechman, our cur-
rent manager who graduates this
year.” .

But Zaleski had a change of heart
and decided to give swimming

.another try. Today, she currently ‘

supplies the team with depth in the
distance freestyle events-depth
that Pitt has been lacking in the past
couple years.

Zaleski began swimming at an
early age, achieved local ranking in
individual events and was part of
two age~group relay teams that
received a Top 10 ran_king
nationally.

However, Zaleski didn’t see

improvement in her performance
and decided to give up the sport
before her senior year in high school.

‘‘I‘ wasn’t swimming very well; I

haven’tgbeen in a while," she said.
“When I was 14, I was swimming
well, but after that I started to swim
poorly and I grew tired of it.”

The idea of returning to organized
swimming came during United
States Swimming Nationals held
over the summer, as she and Belo-
wich discussed the possibility of her
returning.

“Cristen suggested that perhaps
she would like to swim again,” Belo-
wich said. “I told her it was ﬁne, as
long as she did what everyone else
does on the team."

“I also had the understanding that
if she wasn’t going to swim, then she
would be a manager for the team.”

“I talked to him about the idea,”
Zaleski said. “Originally, I wasjust
going tcrbe a manager, since I took
almost two years off from competi-
tive swimming.” ~ .

ested to walk on, since many on the.

team do not have scholarships.

“I have an open-door policy on
walk-ons,” he said. “Anyone who
can handle the workouts makes the
team, as long as the number doesn’t
exceed 24.”

His team was called many things
during the long season, but the ﬁnal
insult might have lifted Foge Fazio’s
silver hair the highest. A reporter,
speaking of Pitt’s off-the-field dress
habits, mentioned that the Panthers

resembled the gang from Welcome

Back Kotter.
Consequently, Fazio has decided

to enact a dress code for next season:
all players must wear sport coats and
ties while appearing at public func-
tions. That means no jeans.

The move, whether a response to
the reporter’s comments or a way of
adding disipline to a team which was
said to be lacking in that area this
past season, seems a bit harsh. Dress
pants and shirts would suffice.

Is Fazio running a football team
or a fashion show? Is he preparing

for an appearance on Johnny Car-
son or a trip to a bowl game? We're
not dealing with corporate execu-
tives, rather a group of football play-
ers, a handful of students. Pierre
Cardin never made much money on
college students.
Discipline?

' Discipline is players obeying
curfews.

5 Discipline is players arriving at
practices on time.

' Discipline is players practicing
more fervently than Kotter’s gang
learns.

9 Discipline is players keeping

their minds on football.

If Fazio can extract the aforemen-
tioned items from his players, he
need not worry about turning them
into Brooks Brothers fanatics. Dis-
cipline is not dictating what players
should wear in public. In fact, its

. probably closer to slavery.

At issue is whether a college foot-
ball coach can rightfully inform his

players how they will dress. Does
receiving a four-year scholarship
mean that the players have bacome
football slaves, that they must
accept everything tossed in their
direction. When a football player
signs a letter of intent to a‘unive'rs‘ity,
he gives in return his playing ability,
not hislife. Or, at least that's the way
it should be.

Despite a disappointing 8-3
record this season, Pitt’s players
have done more than their share. A
Cotton Bowl appearance is a great
image builder for a university. The
estimated $2 million payoff is, well,
enough to dress the entire popula-
tion of Pitt in coats and ties.

It seems that Fazio’s rise to a sur-
rogate fashion promoter is being
used for a scapegoat for a season
that fell short of everyone’s expecta-
tions. Better excuses can be found:

0 The loss of tight end John Brown

» had a crippling effect on the Pan-

thers offense, especially receivers
Dwight Collins and Julius Dawkins.

Discipline Doesn’t Belong, Inside A Wardrobe

Several late-season nagging injuries
didn't help matters, either. _

9 A few games played in less than
satisfactory weather conditions.
Punting into the wind at Penn State
was like trying to thread a needle in
the middle of a hurricane. The Cat-
ton Bowl game at Dallas was a mat-
ter of playing in a sleet storm‘ on a
surface that can be slippery when it’s
dry. _

The Panthers could use these
excuses, but perhaps they should put
the blame upon themselves. They
couldn’t make the big plays when_
they were most needed. They
scrimmage. They couldn’t handle
the weather at Penn State. And they
fumbled on the 1-yard line against
SMU. ‘

In these games they wore football
jerseys, not suits or ties or any other
clothing that would place the Pan-
thers on a best dressed list. They
clothed the same in defeat as they.
did in victory. They looked like foot-
ball players, which is what they are.

Coats, Ties A Welcome Site

By MARK A.S|NDLER

The 1982 football season could
have been subtitled “The Year of
Destiny” in August for all anyone
knew. As far as the Pitt Panthers
were concerned, this would be the
year that fate would bestow on them
a long sought-after national cham-
pionship and overdue recognition.

Dan Marino was a serious con-
tender for the highly-touted Heis-
man before season‘s start. Even the
new guy with the funny sounding
name, Foge Fazio, had as good a
chance to go undefeated as did many
of his predecessors.

It didn’t take too long, however,
before Fa2io_and his squad were
confronted with a barrage of criti-

cism and large amounts of cynicism.
There was the low-scoring fiasco
against North Carolina, and the
Panthers escaped by the skin of their‘
teeth when the Mountaineers came
calling on Oct. 2. Pitt couldn’t even
do better than 14 points against
Temple.

Now the media couldn’t resist.
They were on Fazio like pigeons
around bread crumbs. The hues-
tions came from all angles. Where
was Pitt’s offense? Is Marina out to
lunch on game days? Why can’t.the
Panthers seem to sustain their scor-
ing drives?

Many thought the critics were
only adding fuel to the fire and that
Pitt would eventually come around
to eke out the pre-determined cham-

pionship. They were mistaken,
though. This was only a prelude of
things to come.

After fielding a Volkswagen team-
against the tractor-trailer squads of
Notre Dame and Penn State, the
Panthers were further demoralized
by reports of lacking team unity, in
which Ron Sams and Tim Lewis

were allegedly quoted as saying that .
. people like Julius Dawkins didn‘t

give their best during games.

After these shocks subsided, there
was one y'et‘to come. The event to
give the 1982 season a bitter after-
taste was the death of linebacker
Todd Becker. Just as Pitt was pre-
paring to salvage its season in the

“I give Chris a great deal of
responsibility and expect him to do
some motivating,” D’Amico said. “I
feel the seniors should runthe show,

and Chris has definitely made a con-

siderable contribution.”

Femiani believes that if he can
work‘ hard each day and stay injury
free, he will be satisfied with his per-
formance. “I don’t like to make spe-
cific goals because they often times

become obsessive,” he said. “I feel
that if I am able to compete all year,
then thatalone is an accomplish-
ment that is worth relishing.” '

He enjoys being a part ofa closely
knit team.

“Everyone helps each other.
There are never any problems, and
we all are working for the good of
the team,” Femiani said.

This’ team-’s togetherness has,

encouraged development about
which D’Amico is very excited.
“This is the best team that I have
ever coached. We could finish at 10-
2 orl 1-1. We have to make a step up

-in difficulty but I’m conﬁdent that

we can.” D’Amico said.

A step up in difficulty of routines
is exactly what_it will take if the
Panthers plan to defeat Indiana
State this Saturday, and Chris Femi-

‘ani will be a major part of the win.

Zaleski Manages Contebalcik 9

('()n!inu('d fronz [)(1g‘(' _fr)zn‘l(*('n
water is a difficult task.
“At the beginning, I had prob-

. lems," Zaleski said. “It was hard get-

ting back into shape. I was
competing with other members of
the team and I was not sure of
myself.”

Belowich and junior All-America
swimmer Sue Heon helped Zaleski
through her rough times early in the
season.

“Dave gave me a lot of confi-
dence,” Zaleski said. “And Sue
helped me to believe in myself with
her extra support.”

Zaleski didn’t gain weight after
quitting swimming; she remained in
shape through running. Zaleski did
have to regain the strength she had
while she was . in competitive
swimming.

“I usually ran five to six miles a
day on my own,” Zaleski said.
“When I quit, I lost some weight and

strength.

“The weight training and running
has really helped me." _

Zaleski gained confidence in her-
self during the intense training that
took place in Puerto Rico during
semester break.

“I really worked out well in
Puerto Rico,” Zaleski said. “I said to

myself, ‘Hey, I can do it—it’s really '

worked out well.’ "

“The training in Puerto Rico was
really good for her,” Belowich said.

During her career, Zaleski swam
short-and middle-distance events.
But she said the switch to long dis-
tance hasn’t been difficult.

“I found out in Puerto Rico that I
like swimming longer distances bet-
ter,” Zaleski said. ‘‘I don't mind it at
all as long as it helps the team.”

Zaleski’s body type is more suited
to longer distances.

“Cristen has slow-twitch muscle
fibers, which enables her to repeat

stroke patterns without fatigue,”
Belowich said.

Belowich said the early develop-
ment has helped her comeback into
competitive swimming. ’

“One year is not that much for
someone to take off," he said.
“Cristen didn’t get out of condition
during her layoff. She has good lung
development and good aerobic
capacity.”

Zaleski has 'a good relationship‘

I

with her brother, Jerry, a member '

on the Panther swim team.

“We are very close,” she said of

her brother. “He thought it was a
good,idea to go out for the team.”

“We talk to each other about
everything—even classes. He has
really helped me out.

With a new dedication to swim-
ming, Cristen Zaleski should make
many. contributions to the Lady
Panther swim team—as a partici-
pant, not a manager.

Dress Code KeyTo Discipline

mntinued from page fifteen

Cotton Bowl, that tragedy took its
toll on the entire team. The ﬁnal
score told thetale: 7-3. SMU.

Now Fazio is preparing for a

freshly minted season, hot on the
recruiting trail. Not only is he seek-
ing to gain an upper-hand in this
tri-state area, also inhabitated by
Penn State and West Virginia, but
he is aiming to instill a missing ingre-
dient from last season—discipline.

Not only Fazio,_but those people‘

in area football circles, know that if
the Panthers are going to make any-
thing of themselves in the coming

-years, the discipline has to be there.

One disciplinary measure recently
instituted by Fazio was the require-',
- E I.

merit that all players wear coats and
ties during road trips.

That sounds fair enough. The
players receive _four-year scholar-
ships that offer them the works (full
tuition, room and board) in return
for their athletic abilities. Is it asking
too much to require that they dress
respectably?

They are representing a major
university, and the appearance they
present outside that university

should" reflect some degree of self- .

discipline. And this is what was
totally missing from last season.

If a dress code isn’t initiated, then
the coach might as well excuse play-
ers now and then so they can watch a
favorite TV show. Or, better yet,
why not permit players to miss team

Banishing the Fazio-backed dress
code only leadsto petty arguments.
The players are already given a lot of
beneﬁts inreturn for their gridiron
abilities. Just don’t give them the
opportunity to start toying with the
coaches’ philosophies..dealing with
team matters. .

Playing football -should be
‘enough to worry about. All told, the
way the Panthers played in 1982 left
a lot to be desired. The absence of
discipline showed through clearly.‘
The dress code‘ is as good a place as
any to begin the reincarnation of
coaching authority.
