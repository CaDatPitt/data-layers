srAi=|= REPORT
The Pitt News ‘

For the second consecutive .year, University of
Pittsburgh Medical Center Health System has been
placed on the U.S. News & World Report’s. Honor Roll
as one of the “best of the best” hospitals in the United .
States. A ’ g R
H - UPMC remains the only Pittsburgh—based health sys-
tem to receive this distinction. ’ A ~

‘A According to U.S. News & World Report ,the Honor

1' Roll recognizes institutions that perform at a very high _
' level across many specialties.

UPMC Health System hospitals were recognized for
excellence in 13 out of 16 specialty areas, placing it 15th

‘ outyof 1,701 eligible hospitals in. the United States.

In71999,lUPMC placed, 12th in this category, but  

 ' according to Jane Duffield, director of the UPMC Health

Systern'New -Bureau it is expected for overall rankings to

 “fluctuate from year to year. 0

“These rankings are based on how the subtleties of

 ' the way things are counted,” Duffield said.

Duffield went on to say" that each year different cate- 4

h it gories are added, different parameters are observed, but

thevimportant factor is that UPMC Health System “sus- .
tained a high ranking.” ‘ '

_ “The significant point is that we are listedamong the
best of the best,” she said. " . V *
1 Also included on this select list of nationally presti-

 ‘,g.i.ou's institutions /are Johns Hopkins in Baltimore; the _
_ V Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota? and Stanford
~ University Medical Center in Stanford, California.

“We are pleased that UPMC Health System is once is

 ‘A. again recognized as one of the leading health care orga-
1 _  nizations in the country,” said Jeffrey"Romoff, president

-of UPMC Health System,

 “T ' Romoff went on to say that this ranking provides ‘fur-
  ther evidence that the people of Western Pennsylvania no
 ;-’longer need to travel great distances to findthe very best <

 medical science has to offer. ' 1 _ . . . A
  ‘_‘The country’s leading specialty care is not only
 available here in Pittsburgh, but. -also. throughout the
- region in UPMC’s network of community hospitals,” he
 fsaid.  . . ' ‘

* Two specialty hosp‘ als of UPCM Health System did’

 ‘particularly well in the ratings this year.
1 Western Psychiatric Institute and Clinic went from 

l%2th'last year.to_.10th.’invthe nation: in psychiatry and
Magee-Womens Hospital went. from a ranking of 29th 1

Overall, UPMC is recognized in 13 specialty areas,

Z: more than any other hospital in”Western Pennsylvania.

'29-The system is ranked‘ 4th in ear, nose: and throat; 10th in R

 digestive disorders_;_ 10th in psychiatry (WPIC); 11th in
gynecologyv (Magee-Wpmens Hospital); 12th in orthope-

Pitt researches cooperation  

between two brain areas
during attention

_1 When “red” is not written in red
and “blue” is not written in blue, the
brain will recruit additional help to
identify the color of the word.
Researchers at the University of
Pittsburgh believe studying this task
may clarify the brain’s methods of
attention.

Using a color game called the
Stroop Test, Pitt neuroscience
researchers ‘Angus MacDonald,
Jonathan Cohen, V. Andrew Stenger

and Cameron Carter measured brain

activity using functional magnetic
resonance imaging. They determined
that two separate regions of the
frontal lobe —— the dorsolateral pre-
frontal cortex and the anterior cingu-

gy of attention disorders such as
obsessive—compulsive disorder and
attention deficit hyperactivity disor-
der and diseases affecting cognition
such as schizophrenia. ’ ‘

Pitt’s library system has received
a donation of $10,000 from the

Polish National Alliance to help cat— ‘
alog, preserve and make accessible a .’

collection of rare Polish books, mag-
azines and sound -recordings —-— one

of the top collections of its kind in,

the country.

This collection, rich in Polish
culture and history, had previously
been housed at Alliance College in
Cambridge Springs, Pa., but was

;college closed in
the late 1900s. In
the nine years the
collection has been
housed at Hillrnan
Library, the“ PNA
‘ has donated

lus and asked to identify the color of
the word.
“When you read the word “red”

‘written in blue ink, your natural

reaction is to identify the word,
rather than the color, and you have to
pay careful attention to avoid mak-
ing this error,” said Carter, an asso-
ciate professor of psychiatry. and

.neuroscience at Pitt and associate

professor at the Western Psychiatric

0 Institute and Clinic.

“We used functional magnetic
resonance imaging -— a new brain
imaging technique —— to show that

when subjects prepare to do this.

task, the DLPFC becomes very
active, while the ACC is quiet, and
that the subjects’ DLPFC _perfor-
mance strongly predicted good per-
formance on the tasks,” Carter said.
“In contrast, when subjectsactually
named an incongruent colored word,
activity in the ACC shot up.”

This study validates a theory on
cognitive processing that says two

‘ separate processes contribute to nor-

mal attention. The two frontal lobe
areas serve ‘separate but complemen-
tary functions when "paying atten-
tion. » 0

“These two areas work togeth-

er,” Carter said. “The DLPFC pays"

attention, and the _,ACC lets you
know when you’re doing poorly.”
This information may prove

‘‘We’ll use the money to _help

which are falling apart,” said ‘ULS
Slavic Bibliographer / Karen
Rond‘estvedt. Many of the"'docu-

ments are being reformatted using’
state-of—the-art technology to ensure 1

their preservation. .

Rush Miller, adding that.Pitt is.
working to raise additional money to ,
‘complete the cataloging and preser-

books are cataloged, they become

their use by scholars is growing cor-

respondingly,” Miller said. —

Harry Potter

may provide

4 hope for a literate world

Amazon.com has been buzzing
about the news for months, dedicat-
ing generous space and colorful ban-
ners to J .K. Rowling’s latest install-
ment of _ the Harry Potter series,
“Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire.”

America is accustomed to hyster-
ical pop-crazy crowds, and it didn’t
start with the Christrnastime Cabbage
Patch Kids ﬁasco (the marketers
deliberately understocked stores to
make them more desirable). Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles and Pokemon
are just recent examples of pop
mania; we can go back to the Beatles
to see weeping masses trampling
each other for a glimpse of the real
deal.

But Harry Potter is a ﬁctional kid
living in the pages of a British chil-
dren’s novel. In order to participate in
his stardom, kids are forced to turn
pages instead of stare at screens or
switch on the radio. This pop takes
effort. And it might just save the liter-

. ary world.

' ‘Don’t scrutinize too heavily the
adventures of young Potter; his mag-
ical fun won’-t rival “Billy Budd” for
space on the shelf of great books.
Harry’s friends are witches and wiz-
ards, and his enemies are Lord
Voldemort .and an army of Death
Eaters. It’s unlikely the world will
ever see a leatl1er—bound Oxford edi-
tion with footnotes and critical

essays. It’s just not that deep.

But Potter’s world is an attractive
one. Instead of retelling old folk tales
or transcribing some morality play (a
la Berenstein Bears), Rowling draws

readers into a world where anything '
can happen. Harry is an every—kid, '

special by circumstance, but familiar

to pre—pubescents, no matter where «

they live (you can ﬁnd German trans-
lations in the windows of the
University Book Center). _

But Harry isn’t just kid’s stuff.
Rowling has also intrigued parents
and teachers, college students and
professionals. People who may read
only one other book a year (about
Princess Diana, no doubt) may enjoy-
a little sorcery. It’s never too late to
exercise imagination.-

So it’s important to prevent ‘

Potter from becoming its own fran-
chise. Wrll a movie ruin the books’
legacy? What about collectible
mugs? We’ve already seen Oprah
endure controversy for the commer-
cialism of her Book Club, and
Rowling has all the ingredients for the
same stew.

In a world where boolm are an
endangered species, it’s relieving to
see kids curling up to a good story.
And clever fantasy is the perfect prep
for harder stuff — Tolkien, Marques,
Dostoyevsky, etc. It’s too early for
books to become obsolete. '

What shall the bishops do?

If tl1ere’s one thing at which Christians have
always seemed to .excel, it’s disagreeing with
each other. Ordination of women to the ministry,
adult vs. child baptism, interfaith marriage, mili-
tary service, the death penalty, divorce — these
are just a few of the dozens of topics that have
inspired debate boﬂi within and between: the
major Christian denominations.

And with the passage of the new civil umon -

act in Vermont, Christians both within that state
and elsewhere have something new to argue
about This act, which went into effect July 1,
gives lesbian and gay couples the option of hav-
ing their unions formally recog-
nized by the state of Vermont. With
this recognition, same-sex couples
in that state gainaccess to virtually
all of the rights alforded to hetero-
sexual married couples.

The civil unions bill was many months in
the maldng. It stemmed from a lawsuit ﬁled by
three Vermont same-sex couples who were seek-
ing the right to many. A December 1999 ruling
by the Vermont Supreme Court ruled that sarne-_
sex couples were entitled to the same rights and
protwtions as opposite-sex married couples, and
left it to the state legislature, to devise a wayto
provide them these rights.

Bot.h the Vermont State House and Senate
worked to craft and pass what became known as
the civil unions bill, and Gov. Howard Dean i
signed it into law in April .

The diverse Christian community of _

Vermont has been widely divergent in its
responses to. this historic legislation. On one end
of the spectrum is Kermeth Angell, the Roman
Catholic bishop of Burlington, Vt. The bishop,
who seems to be absolutely obsessed with gay

. unions, waged a very public war against the leg-

islation every step of the way. Many of . his
speeches and press releases have been made
available at his : diocesan Web site
(http://www.vermontcatholic.org). ‘
In his Feb. 2 testimony to the Velmont
House. of Representatives, Angell clairnedthat
“the sacredness of marriage and the family as
ordainedjby Godis in jeopardy.” Quoting some"

the bishop warned the legislators against replac-

‘ ing the Bible “with a book of political correct-

ness.”

But Angell’s heated rhetoric against the civil
unions is not exemplary of all of Verrnont’s
 clergy. Consider the position of Susan
Morrison, a bishop of the  Methodist
Church’s northeastern region. An active support-
er of gay rights, Morrison joined an interfaith

group of clergy inrsigning a statement in support- 

of the civil union legislation. . A

After participating in that action, the bishop
released a statement of her own in" which she
clariﬁed her position: ‘The state-
ment [in favor of civil unions] is
consistent with my position.
throughout my ministry as being _
one of mercy and justice for all of
God’s children.” Both statements
were made available on her conference Web site
(http://wwwgbgrn-umc.org/). A ‘ 5

I am struck by the vast gulf betweenﬂiese
two  bishops. This civil tmions bill 

not require Catholic priests to perform ‘gay ,

unions. The church will be free, in the ecclesias-
tic sphere, to continue to  against gay
couples, just as it restricts levels of church partic-
ipation for divorced persons, women and others.
Angell seems to be engaging in an attempt to use ’
the political process to inﬂict his interpretation of
Catholic doctrine upon all Vermonters, regard-
less of their religion. And that’s just plain wrong.
Morrison, on the other hand, appears to have
grasped a fundamental truth. Same.-sex couples,
like interfaith couples . and interracial couples, _
deserve certain fundamental civil rights and pro-
tections. Just becanse an individual’s religious
beliefs may be in opposition to these types’ of

unions does not give him or her the right to’ dis-
“  against them in the civil sphere. 2

  Increasing tuition costs should benefit all

It’s no surprise that the Board of
Trustees passed a tuition increase. The 5 per-
cent increase was the largest in eight years
and double the rate of interest. I’ve come to

expect the cost of my education to become.

more expensive, since. basic costs will
increase every year. But an increase so large
requires a better explanation
than supplies and salaries. I
don’t think administrators have
met the challenge of justifying

Chancellor Mark
Nordenberg and other University ofﬁcials
say the tuition increase is necessary to main-
tain the quality of our education. They claim
the money will be used to beneﬁt students,
citing technology upgrades and salary
increases to keep facilities and staff compet-
itive. But when I look at the proposed big-
ticket items, I see a lot of money moving out
of my pocket and away from any program
that beneﬁts me. .

First, we have $20.2 million for health
sciences projects, all of which beneﬁt
UPMC groups and facilities or the medical
school. Then, we have $6 million for energy
conservation initiatives. I thought saving
energy was supposed to help save money,

I‘ not use it. Finally, we have $6 million for

‘ building preservation, noting that this is not

referring to the justiﬁable $5.5 million allo-
cated to building maintenance.
I fail .to see why I, a College of Arts and

' Sciences student, should be paying for these

'  programs.'I’m glad the Western Psychiatric

Institute and Clinic are available to me if I
should ever have a psychotic episode,.but I

I resent having to work harder to pay for
' tuition money that’s being funnelled up

Cardiac Hill. I have insurance for that. Nor
do I think building preservation merits a

- Nordenberg claims there will be
improvements made to residence ‘life, but I
don’t live on campus (and neither do
approximately 65 percent of full-time under-
graduates) and I don’t need to pay for some-
one else to have a nicer, dorm or a better

University of Pittsburgh remains a true high-

 “And quality is more important even than

It mustbe nice for Nordenberg and the

good deal we’re getting. But it doesn’t make

I never thought I’d say, “Look to Penn
State,” but Penn State seems justiﬁed in an
even larger increase than Pitt’s, at 6.23 per-
cent. Why? They have outlined speciﬁc
plans that directly beneﬁt the students who
who are paying the increase: better parking
and 24-hour access to a new ﬁtness and stu-
dent center. They also claim to
have student support for the
increase in tuition. Did Pitt
ofﬁcials even consult those
students who will be paying
tuition?

As for next year’s budget, I wouldn’t
mind a similar cost increase, so long as it is
paired with an agenda that beneﬁts me. Let’s
look into classroom improvements, includ-
ing multi-media capabilities. Renovations
are planned for the Cathedral of Learning,

but plans to improve classrooms need not
stop there. ‘

How about expanding’ the number of
campus police “blue lights” around the
Oakland area? What about revamping the
advising programs, so that more people get
the direction they need to graduate on time?
How about re-evaluating scholarships for
returning students? Costs continue to go up,
but merit scholarships, for the most part, stay
the same. How about more funding for stu-
dent services, such as expanding the accessi-
bility of day care or of the student health cen-

...jier?_ How about asking those who will be
paying the increased tuition what programs
or projects they would like to see undertaken

or increased?

Staff Writer

It’s hard not to start by saying how awesome “X-Men”
is. It’s so uncheesy, I started to feel like I was in a Gap ad or
something, where everything is choreographed perfectly
and subtle jokes‘ abound. It’s almost too hip to bear:

There are just some comic books thatyou can’t mess
around with, and if director Brian Singer (“L.A.
Conﬁdential”) had screwed up something or crossed a cer-

tain line, he probably wouldn’t have been able to walk with ,

his head up ever again.

The special effects were sparse and tasteful. There were
a few red beams shooting out of eyes, a couple of kick ﬁghts
in mid air, some window panes smashing and an obligato-
ry car crash. All ounces of goo, blood draining touches and
morphing bodies were executed perfectly. The cuts were

" always made just before the audience had a chance to roll

their eyes and experience the poor effects of the sinking

Patrick Stewart (Professor X),  it = ’
Anna Paquin (Rogue) and Ian ﬁgﬁggl
McKellan (Magneto) all hit their
marks beautifully, conveying an
almost jaunty approach to saving
the world —— or destroying it;
Sometimes the ‘ﬁlm was so busy‘

had no lines at all: This was great
for Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-'
Stamos) who, thankfully, only had one line (her major parts
were played by the characters she morphed into‘). Halle
Berry as Storm was a disappointment; she’s a good actress,
and she would have been great if she wasn’t,trying to talk
with Storm’s African accent. _
At times the story seemed a little rushed. While the ﬁlm

introduces characters and possible love
interests for the sequels, it also goes
through a heavy—handed and underdevel-
oped take on mutant discrimination. From
the shots of a Nazi war camp, to the McCa1thy—era court-
room to a newscaster talking about the international mutant
summit, we get the idea that mutants are the minority 4-
tlreir discrimination is played as bigger than gender, race,
religion, sexual identity and class combined. Mutants aren’t
even considered human, and nobody’s got it tougher than

on propors

‘ them. This explains why the bad mutants ‘hate everybody
 they were ragged on for having blue scaly skin. Fair
enough. '
What sets them apart ﬁ‘om the rest of the human race is
that most of them can’t even be around normal people with-
out hurting them. This anguish is enough to keep most of
them on the run until Professor X swoops in to save them.
Don’t worry if you haven’t been reading the comic
since its 1938 inception. Aside from missing a few inside
jokes aboutyellow Spandex, you won’t miss a beat.

GABRIEL DAVIS
The Pitt News

The smell of marijuana is in the air
with the approach of the “Up in Smoke
Tour” featuring hip—hop giants Dr. Dre, Ice
Cube, Warren G, Eminem and a host of oth-
ers, including Snoop Dogg, who almost
didn’t make it on the tour because of that
very smell. . ‘

On June 16’authorities in.Temecula,
Calif., which borders Mexico, sniffed
something funny in Snoop’s tour bus and
would have arrested the rapper if not for a
passenger who, loyal to his Doggfather,
took. the blame for the 300 grams of pot,
keeping Snoop out of jail and,asalways,
laid back. ,

It is this irreverent attitude that the “Up

in Smoke Tour” promises to deliver, with
each rapper not only doing his individual
set, but also collaborating at the end of the
show for a reunion of the explosive and
highly controversial N.W.A. The tour will
reach 25- cities in a seven—week run that
began June 15 in San Diego and will arrive
at Pittsburgh’s Mellon
Arena July 26 at 7 p.m.
You’d think that a

MARIO MACH!
Sports Editor

The eyes of the women’s basket-
ball world were focused on Phoenix
Monday night for the WNBA All-Star
game. However, women’s basketball
was making a pretty big impact here in
Pittsburgh, as well.

I Fitzgerald Field House was the site
for the first annual adidas Top 10

Camp, which began on Saturday and .

ended last night. Run by adidas and the
All-Star Girls Report publication, the
camp was a showcase of 160 of the best
high school girls basketball players in
the nation.

Mike White, the editor of the
ASGR, lives in Monroeville, Pa., and
when he agreed to a deal with adidas to
hold the camp, he called Pitt women’s
hoops coach Traci Waites to get her
thoughts on holding the event at

-Fitzgerald Field House.

“He called Traci and she thought it
was a great idea, and we did too,” said
Bret McCormick, the scouting editor
for the publication.

McCormick also cited the quality
of Pittsburgh International Airport as a
reason for the city being chosen to host
the event.

“Any time you have a tournament
with kids from 35 states, you’re going

to need, an airport to accommodate
them,” McCormick said. A,

Western, Pennsylvania’s reputation
as a top-notch girl’s basketball location
also helped in the selection process.

“Girl’s basketball is always great
here,” McCormick said. “There is no
doubt about that.”

One of the big names in Western
Pennsylvania to attend the camp was
Jess Strom, a guard from Steel Valley
High School who is regarded as the top
high school player in the area. -

There were 162 players in the
camp, and more than 160- college
coaches attended.

Big East coaches in attendance
included Ferne Labati of Miami,
Villanova’s Harry.Perretta and Darcel
Estep of St. J ohn’s. In addition, nation'-
al powerhouses like Connecticut,
Tennessee, Florida, North Carolina
State, Notre Dame and Arizona were
represented by assistant coaches.

The players were split up into 16
teams, each given the nickname of one
of the WNBA teams. Then individual
instruction followed for two days, with
Monday and Tuesday being used to
showcase the players in games.

Most of the individual workouts
were conducted by high school and
Amateur Athletic Union coaches from

Camp, page 13

“Swing and a miss, strike three, and that ends the with runners in scoring position and the Bucs down by

It’s getting a’ little old hearing this from Greg
Brown and Lanny Frattare, the radio announcers of the
Pittsburgh Pirates. ’

As I sat in my crumbling

night watching the Pirates lose
their sixth consecutive game, I

When I say -over, I don’t
mean out-of-the-playoffs over. The Bucs were out of
the playoffs in spring training. I meant that my interest
in the season was over, and that is the earliest it has
happened. , '

In the rnid-1980s, the Pirates were awful, but I still
enjoyed watching them play. I know I mention him
often in my columns, but Sammy Khalifa was the clos-
est thing I had to a hometown hero. Pretty sad, huh?

This year, it makes me visibly sick to see the
Pirates lose, because of the way they do it. A '

It’s Pat Meares, who is making $4 million a year,
swinging and missing time and time again.

It’s Chad Herrnansen, the future of the
 team, looking worse as the year

goes on. I .

Finally, it’s Gene Lamont, the
Pirates’ manager, sitting in the
dugout with the same look on his
face as-- his team gets beat upon
. with the proverbial whooping stick
2*’ game after game.

My solution is simple. Trade Young,
Meares and Hermansen for ‘somebody that can put the
ball in play and fire Lamont. .

Even if the Pirates get three minor league players
in the deal, it can’t be any worse than having the Three
Stiffs in the lineup.

Move John Vander Wal to first base, which will
keep him out of the outﬁeld but keep his bat in the
lineup. A ‘

Warren Morris can stay at second base, even

   
  

though he’s looked nothing like the player who fans

. fell in love with last year.

Let Mike Benjamin play every day at shortstop,
just because he plays the game hard and his glove is
not a major liability. At least Benjamin knows how to
pull the bat off his shoulders when he needs to.

Aramis Ramirez, another up-and-comer for the
last several seasons, has shown the Pirates some pro-

duction for their pennies. He may not have Brooks 1

Robinson’s glove, but he doesn’t have Bobby
Bonilla’s, either. .

For now, Jason Kendall has to stay behind the
plate, but I still feel that if the Pirates trade him, they
can get an adequate catcher to replace Kendall and
beef up other parts of the lineup. _ I
