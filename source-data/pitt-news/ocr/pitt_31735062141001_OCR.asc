Chancellor Delivers Stirring Talk—
Large Attendance at Chapel.

Before an audience of student's.and
faculty which overﬂowed the chapel,
Chancellor McCormick gave one of
the best and most earnest talks of

’ , the year last Friday morning. Every

student who was absent from this 
nal meeting of. the year missed some-
thing invaluable to him, and all those
present felt and received some of the
spirit which the speaker felt and ex-
pressed throughout his speech.

The Chancellor began with several
remarks concerning chapel attend-

, ance a'nd the meeting of the morning,

expressing himself delighted with the
very large attendance at this the last
meeting of the school year—a partic-
ularly appropriate time for a full at-
tendance. ,
about which I wish to speak to you
this morning.”

The ﬁrst of these matters the Chan-
cellor mentioned was the earnest de-
sire that all the ‘students be present
‘at all the commencement exercises.
The presence of the students is -the
Visible university to the public.

Next the principal theme of the
speech was taken up. This was the
observance of the Anniversary Day
and the Anniversary year of 1912. The
hope was expressed that by the open-
ing of the fall term of .1911, things
would be in such shape that the de-
mainder of the work would be in such
shape that the remainder would be
comparitively small. The speaker im-
pressed his hearers with the fact that
a great success was wanted and need-
ed for this celebration and that it was
a great undertaking, demanding much
sacriﬁce and work. He said: “It is a
signiﬁcant year because it is the 125th
anniversary of the granting of a char
ter for a school of higher learning to
Pittsburgh—then a small village of
four or ﬁve log houses and a number
of stores. Talk about this; ﬁll the
people of Pittsburg with the idea that
the thing of which they should be
proudest is theUniversity of Pitts-
burgh which is older even than the
famous mills. Make the year of 1912
a real‘ anniversary year. Let us get
on ﬁre ourselves and get the people
of Pittsburgh on ﬁre so that they will
help their university. But we must

,get on ﬁre ourselves or we cannot

hope the people to assist us.

\

Although only a year old the school
of Education of the University of
Pittsburgh is already very strong. ‘Its
ﬁrst year is marked by the gradua-
tion of eight students. Of these, half
have already received ﬁne positions
while the others will shortly receive
like places. This school has given
training in the ﬁrst year of its exis-
tence to over six hundred teachers.

During the year a total of ﬁfteen
lectures/have been given to the teach-
ers institutes of this state. Fourteen
addresses on education have also
been furnished. The Dean of the
school has been honored by the‘ elec-
tion to the position of President of
the Depa tment of Child Study of the
National ducational Association. The
very‘ successful “First Annual Con-
vention of the Secondary Schools and
Colleges_of Western Pennsylvania”
was held by the school. 5

For the coming year, remarkably
strong professors have been secured.
Dr. Henry D. Sheldon, at present Dean
of the School of Education in the Un-
iversity of Oregon has accepted the
position of Professor of the History
of Education at Pitt. Dr. Sheldon at
present is president of the Oregon
Association of Tigh Schools and Col-

BACCALAUREATE SERMON LAST
SABBATH

CLASS OF 1910 HOLDS‘ BANQUET

 

Large Reunion of Last Year's Class
Last Night

 

Members of the Class of 1910 cele-
brated the close of their ﬁrst year’s
struggle “out i'n the cold‘, cold world”
with a reunion and banquet at the
Fort Pitt Hotel last evening. The
famous Dutch room, which has been
the scene of many student functions re

cently was chosen for the festivities.

Of the 39 male members of the class,
28 were in attendance and the banquet
proved a thoroughly enjoyable one
with plenty of real college spirit as an
enliening inﬂuence.

John J. O’Connor, president of the
1910 student senate, who as an under-
graduate did more to “start things”
at Pitt than any man during the last
decade, acted as toastmaster. In his
happy manner he awakened the slum_
bering oratorical powers of the ’1O
boys and the result was some stirring,
enthusiastic speeches for Pitt and her
interests. The Dutch room was taste-
fully decorated with the university col-
ors. “Zim” Wagoner, ’13 was on hand
to “tickle” the piano. ‘

The 1910ers hold their next reun-
ion in 1913. A permanent class alumni
organization has been formed and the
members have pledged themselves to
“stick” for the‘ university. All the
boys are doing well in business and in
the years to come Pitt can feel no
hesitancy on calling on them for sup-
port. '

The program follows:

Music, “Stein Song.” Toasts: “On the
Brink of Matrimony” Waldemar W.
Zieg; “Third Installment on Spirit,”
Robert E. Neeld; “The Engineer (?),”
J. Milnor Roberts;“Loyalty to Pitt,”
Reed M. Lewis; _“Athletics,” Karl E.
Davis; “The Pennsy and How 1’ Run

Chancellor Preaches on Faith to Large
Graduating Class.

Chancellor McCormick preached the
Baccalaureate sermon before the
graduating class of the University
last Sabbath morning in the First
United Presbyterian Church. He se-
lected for his text Heb. 11:1.” “Now
Faith in the assurance of things
hoped for, the conviction of things
not seen.” He said in part:

“Faith is a fundamentalfact of hu-
man experience. We are familiar
with this fact in the scheme of sal-
vation and are, measurably familiar
with it invthe ordinary experience of
life. Few, however, realize how fun-
damental it is in every department
of human activity. We are dwelling
in the midst of unsettled business
conditions at the present time, the
only explanation of which is the lack
of faith. The harvests have been
plentiful. Work in great abundance
is waiting to be performed. Capital,
however, is resting inactive because
nowhere is absence of faith.

The writer of Hebrews gives a cata-
log of ancient worthies and in connec-
tion with them illustrates this great

fact of faith in the world. Without‘
any attempt to deﬁne the term’ or

even to discuss the subject logically,
we wish to call attention to some of
these essential elements.

The ﬁrst of these is Vision. The
heroes of the 11th Chapter of Hebrews
Were men who could see that‘which
was vinisible to the ordinary man.
Because they could see the invisible,
therefore, they could do the impossi-
ble. It is always so. No man ever
achieved magniﬁcently who did not
train himself to behold marvels of the
unseen. It matters not whether it is
a general on the ﬁeld of battle, the
artist with his canvas, the sculptor
with his marble or the author as he
plans ‘the product of his literary
genius——vision plays its part and
without it the product is of little
worth.

Another element of faith. is expect-
ancy. Here again, is a fundamental
concept. No man ever, received
largely who did not expect largely.
Faith is" more than Hope, and yet
there canbe no faith without hope
and there can be no achievement
without expecting that the thing will
be accomplished.

Another element of faith is courage
and power. We do not seek to rea-
son closely as to whether this is an

‘Ten “P” Men in Football Will Play

Next Year—-Strong Man

The season of 1910 was the Uni.
'versity’s banner football year. The
record of Captain “Tex” Richards’
great gridiron squad has been oft re-
peated and was heralded throughout
the entire United States. Brieﬂy

stated, nine victories were achieved,

netting-a total of 282 points for the
Blue and Gold. Not"a single point
was made by opponents. The crown-
ing triumph of the year" was the
11—0 victory Thanksgiving Day over
Penn State. This victory , carried
with it the ﬁrst leg of the Spalding
football trophy credited to Pitt. State
had already won two, so that the rec-
ord now stands one game in their
favor. A victory in 1911 will -even

‘matters up. ,-

CAPTAIN RICHARDS

The following men received their
“P” in football as a result of the 1910
season: “Tex” Richards, Lindsay,
Galvin, Dewar, Peacock, Blair, Bailey,
Budd, Quailey, Brown, Dallenbacm,
Wagner, Stevenson, Gehlert, Butler
and Dave Richards. Of these 16 men,
10 remain and will form the nucleus
of the 1911 squad. They are‘ Lindsay,
Galvin, Dewar, Blair, Quailey, Brown,
VVagne'r, -Stkevenson, Gehlert and Dave

PAST AND FUTURE.

Another year has passed into his-

tory. ‘But the experiences and the’:

memories which it has left with us
will never be lost. The w‘o_rk'we -have
done in the classroom, the pleasant
social events which we have enjoyed,
the success of our teams, athletic and
literary, in which we rejoiced have,
all left a mark upon our lives not to
be blotted out in a lifetime. An
Eventful and well spent year it has
been our fortune ‘to enjoy. We have
seen our school growing, adding new
students everyday, securing new pro-
’fess‘ors noted for their success in
other institutions, winning; its battles
on the forum and on the athletic ﬁeld.
~ 'VW'e have seen our own growth too.

. , This has not been alone in the class-

room, although the work ‘done during

-‘.:t‘e‘-_la,st,year has been of a high.

grade. Much of that real training

But let us now turn from the past
to the future. A review of the past
tells us what has been accomplished.
Next year holds our duty for the fu-
ture. Let us come back in the com-

ing fall with a determination to make

our school work more thorough, more
earnest and pains-taking. Let us
make our “ school life more social,
There will be a large

It will fall to us as men use'd to the
trials of College lifeto help these in-
coming men in every way_poss_ibl‘e.
In the University of Pittsburgh it has
long been 9. matter of great pride to

_the students and alumni ‘that there

is no hazing here. Let this reputa-

tion be maintained through future
years and the new men treated in
that hospitable manner --which has
characterized previous years.

Then, also, we must come back

which show the real strength of a
man. Almost invariably the man at
the head of histclass in the lecture
room will be found in the lead in the
student organizations. Strong as our
clubs and societies have been during
the last year, there yet remains much
room for improvemnet. More mem-
bers, livelier meetings, more enthusi-
asm, are all ‘demanded by the future.
The men now in school are the men
who must ﬁll these demands. W_e
know our duty. Most certainly we
will ﬁll,it.

~COMMENCEMEN'l'.

The qustion is often asked, “What
does commencement mean?” Ordi-
narily the outward observer believes
it to‘ mean that a man has done at
least a certain minimum amount of
work imposed by the faculty, in a vain
attempt to prevent men from grad-

uating. It is true that commence-’

ment can only be reached by the un-.
dergraduate through four years of
comparatively hard work. We often
hear it said that the collegejman has
an easy time. A happy time he cer-
tainly is blessed with, for that period
of life is naturally the joyous one.

But an easy time is very difficult to-

ﬁnd in University life. Unlike the
workingman who, when he has work-.
ed his eight or nine hours a day, is
through, the college student must not
only spend his regular -day in arduous
work, but must -also devote a large
proportion of his evenings to study.
So commencement means that several

hundred young men and women ‘have’

been Willing to sacriﬁce a little pleas-
ure to secure an education. _

'But commencement means even

more than the successful. completion-
It means thiat.

of academic studies-.
a man has higher i'deals,'.with _the
knowledge and desire to put his ideals
into practical operation. It. means
that a man is imbued with a spirit of
self-sacriﬁce which will lead him to
devote himself to the interests of his
fellows. Above all, commencement
marks the beginning of the active
life of the moral educated citizen.

PITT FOR PITTSBURGH.

The true function of any large uni-I

versity is to furnish men capable of
leadershipin the most diﬂicult enter-
prises. So the function .of the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh is to train men
and women’ to lead the way in all
lines of advance and- improvement,
especially around Pittsburgh. The
University should lead all movements
toward‘a better city. That the city’s
unevisirty is well performing this
duty, is shown by the appointments
to the new city council. For these

important positions, men of the high-

est caliber were needed. So when

It is these

the City of Pittsburgh needed strong,
able men to conduct her affairs, she
called on the University to, furnis_h_
the greater number of these men.
Surely no higher tribute could be
found to the manner in which our
college is fulﬁlling its function to the
city.

Nor is alone along governmental,
lines that Pitt is aiding the city de-
velop its utmost capabilities. Many
of our graduates are entering socio-
logical work, fascinated by‘ the in-
tense struggle to improve conditions-
in this city. The training which the
school gives along this line of work
is invaluable. Here the men are ﬁrst.
interested in the great social problem
confronting this city and long before
they are through their course here,
‘many men have already volunteered
their services to the different organ-
izations whose endeavor it is to raise
the social standard of our home city.
And in the coming year, plans have
been made by the University to in-
crease greatly the number of men
interested in such helpful and inspir-
ing work. The city is demanding

more men for this work every year..

The universary_is "answering this de-
mand with an ever increasing supply
of earnest, well trained social work-
ers with men who realize it to be
their duty to help all such workers
with every means at their disposal.
Here, as in the government, the uni-
versity is ably fulﬁlling its function
to this community. I

This co-operation between city and
school must of necessity grow in the
future. The city will more_ and more
foster this gteat school of over 2,000
students devoted to the task of ﬁtting
men and women for their life work
as true and loyal citizens. .And the,
college as its different departments,
touchingevery phase of city life, con-
tinually expand and reach out for a

. more practical expression of its de_

votion to the community, will become.
the very heart of all movements
striving to better the city of Pitts-
burgh. “This co-operation_ between
city and university, having proved a

success in the past, ‘must by the very-

necessity of events,-continually be-

‘come closer and more effective.

COLLEGE ‘COURHSES
GAIN STRENGTH

Greatest Year in History- of College
Ends.—Students. From» Other Col-
leges Enter.

The last year has seen a wonderful
development in the college. The His-

_ tory Department has increased to one

hundred and sixty-eight students.
GreekVand~Latin during the last year
were stronger than ever before and
these two departments in conjunc-
tion with the English Departme'nt-are

‘ now instituting a propaganda point-=

ing out the beneﬁts of a‘ classical edu-
cation. The English courses have at-
tracted many students from other col-.
leges. Public speaking has become
one of the most popular courses in
the -college. In psychology the num_
ber of students has almost doubled.
In the graduate department of the
Biology, course, several‘ actual con-
tributions to our present knowledge
have been made ‘during this year.

The notable occurrences of the year
were the surprising number of new
students, the increase in the college
faculty and the higher standard of

_ work. The future of the college seems

very promising. Many graduates of
other colleges have entered Pitt as
candidates for baccalaureate degrees,
especially in the department of psy-
chology, history and English. The
fact that these graduates of other col-
leges enter as candidates for a bach-
elors’ 'degree indicates‘ that the re-
cent reorganization of courses is at-
tracting a very desirable class of stu-
dents. A ‘ '

you planning to bring?” suddenly de-
manded the Chancellor, A “We want to_
grow along all lines and one of the
most effective things you can do to
help this growth is to bring new stu-
dents.” - p

A Then the Chancellor spoke very ear-
nestly concerning the student build-
ing which is much needed. “We want
a student building here,” he declared,
“and when we‘ want it bad_ enough,
We’ll get it. Now, I want you to plan
for this building. Be earnest and en-
thusiastic and you can get it easily.’-'
He then stated that work on the gym-
nasium has already begun and that it
was hoped to have the gymnasium
ready for the opening of the fall term.
Also it was expected that the Dental
School would be on the university
campus in the fall and that the road
would be completed.

“Now, can we get the companion.
building for the gymnasium?” he.
asked. “The enthusiasm of the ‘stu-
dents is back of all this and rthey
must get this student building.”

Speaking in regard to the ﬁrst

“Boosters” meeting the Chancellor de-O

clared: “I have heard a great deal
about that meeting and I am very sor-
ry I was compelled to be absent.
have heard that it was a most excel-
lent meeting. But mere feeling with-
out action is not only a good thing
but ‘a bad thing for anybody. We
‘shall make next year a great year just
in proportion as we can stir up the
young men and women of our univer-
sity to make it a great year. Outside
people are hard to stir up, but a1-
r ehtdya eyare stirred up wonderfully
over this celebration.” And then the
Chancellor made a rather startling
statement. “I do not exaggerate one
bit when I say that the institution
which is attracting the most attention
from the Alantic to the Paciﬁc is the
university of Pittsburgh. Pittsburgh
is famous, not so mu frociitsndshu

7 is famous not so much for its indus-

tries and business ‘growth but for its
University.”

“Now, if the outsideworld is so af-
fected by our institution as this, are
not we, the students and faculty vi-
tally concerned?” he demanded. “We
must all be enthusiastic ‘and, _if it is
no more than a dollar bill or a word

spoken to somebody let us all jump in»

and help in this work. Only by the
hearty co-operation and support of the
students and alumni canithis be a suc-
cess.” C

The hearty applause that greeted
the Chancell8or as he ﬁnished was a
ﬁtting tirbtue and attested to the fact
that his earnest words had not fallen
on deaf ears. ‘ H. R. A.

element of faith or a result of-faith,
but in anyrevent, it’-is that in the
man which gives him capacity to ac-
complish results and which comes to

might the thing can be'd3-lie.

These men mentioned by the writer
of ‘Hebrews were men of this sort.‘
When co/m.:_rt.:;nded, they obeyed and
whether " 111:3 Abraham they knew
whither they were to go, they hesi-
tated not, but went ‘forth splendidly
courageous because they believed in
the invisible. . L

Another quality of these men and
another elem.ent of faith was their
conﬁdence. that they would see the
city whose builder and maker is God.
They accounted themselves strangers
and pilgrims and believed tl;r.t their
mission, as they walked the earth
was not to gather the things of the
earth by the way, but was to press on

they might be found worthy to enter
in. ‘

Whether as a fact of Christian ex-
perience os as a fact of ordinary life,
the lesson in the 11th chapter of He-
brews is one of essential‘ value.
Faith alone, nerves the man to ac-
complish theimpossible. Without it
a man is so powerless as to lack
manhood itself. He must believe su-
premely in himself ‘and in his fellows
and because he believes in. himself,
and his fellows, must believe su-
premely in his God or else he neither
achieves nor lives worthily of his
Divine Sonship.

As the young men of this class go
forth to take their places among men:
let them be inspired by faith and they

achievement.

ENGINEERING SCHOOL MAKES
ANQTH ER ADVANCE.

 

Course in Railroad Engineering Will
» Be Started. More Equipment
Sesured. ‘

 

The School of Engineering has tak-
en another step in modern engineer-
ing. A new course in Railroad Engin-
eering will be instituted this coming
year. The course will be open to all
present sophomores. As at present
outlined, men intending to enter this
take the regular
school work_ during ‘the ﬁrst two
years themen will specialize in rail-
years, but in the Junior and Senior
road work. The course will be given
under the direction of D. H. Crawford,
General Superintendent Motive Power
of the Pennsylvania Lines.

Mr. Crawford is a member of many
engineering and railroading associa-
tions. He is past president of the
Western Railway Club of Chicago,
Car
Builders’ Association and Vice-Pres-
ident of the American IMaster Me-
chanics’ Association. He is also Re-
porter for the International Raliway
Congress, Eighth Session.

Plans are being drawn for carrying
on cooperative work im railroading in
connection with and under the super-
vision of the railroad lines of Pitts-
burgh. Certain parties have promised
to furnish the best_ equipment for
this department.‘ It is expected that
a testing department for the rail-
roads will be established ‘here in con-
nection Iwith this course.

The School 'of Engineering will
start next year vwith"a much larger
faculty. Many new men of great ex-
-perience and of high standing in the
engineering world have been secured

for the coming year. Much’ new

equipment will be soon ordered and
the laboratories and test rooms will
be very much improved.

BATERS AN_D ’ ORATOR

 

Fine Prospect for Debating Next
Year-—New Orator «Must
Be Found.

Pittthis year did exceedingly well
on the platform.‘ Our afﬁrmative de-
bating tzam, consisting of Ralph E.
George, ’12, Captain; Robert H. Wet-
tach, ’13, and Horace Allison, '14, suc-
ceeded in breaking the run of hard
luck which has been pursuing Pitt
by defeating the Allegheny College
team decisively by a vote of three to,
nothing. Although the negative team
consisting of James Mardel, ’11, Cap-
tain;' Joseph Irons, ’13, and Enoch
Pratt, ’14, lost to Wooster, yet they
men, only one -will be lost this year.
Every man on the teams which de-
feated Allegheny this year will be
with us next year. Besides these old
men, there are already very strong
men who have already signiﬁed their
intention of trying for ‘next /year’s

team. The {prospects for winning
teams is accordingly very bright.

‘Our representative onthe district’

contest, although unable /toland ﬁrst
.1;lace, yet did_very good work. Mr.
‘Archer, ’11, will be lost this year by
graduation, but as there are several
men who are well ﬁtted for this posi
tion, it is expected that our orator
will be successful next year.

This year, on the whole has been
very successful from the standpoint
of the debater and orator. Never be-
fore has so much interest been shown

I in these two branches of intercollegi-

ate competion. VVith the enthusiasm
which has arisen this year for oratory
and debating, Pitt should easily make
next year a banner year.«

 

REGULAR SUMMER ITERMN For-2
MINERS.

 

Summer Term in School, of Mines
»Will Give Full Work.

 

Dr. VVadsworth, dean of the School
of Mines, has announced that the
summer work in that school will con-
sist of regular term work instead of
summer school work as heretofore.
'l‘l1i will place the four term system
all of the professors in this school
in full operation. During the summer
will be here except Prof. Goodale,
who will be absent in Newfoundland
on a mining investigation tour.

A large amount of new equipment
will be installed during the summer.
Some of the latest inventions will be
secured for the future work of the
school. The corps of professors and
instructors will be materially streng-
thened. The co-operative system from
now on will be fully followed.

During the last week H. VV. Montz,
Mining Engineer for the Lehigh Val-
ly Coal Co.,- a former student of Dr:

'Wadsworth’s visited the school and

his old dean.

 

Pitt Professor Will Speak at Society
of . Engineering Education-

The Societyfor the Promotion of
Engineering Education will hold a
meeting in Pittsburgh, June 26, 27,
28, inclusive. On one day of the con-
vention will be held at the University
of Pittsburgh. Dr. Bishop will ‘deliver
an address on ‘The Value of the Co-
operative System in Engineering
Education.” ‘Professor Knowles will
lecture on “Sanitary Engineering.” A
luncheon will be given in behalf of the
University of Pittsburgh.

It is the desire of the local ‘com-

gineering to come in contact with the

. notable engineering features of the

Pittsburgh District. It hopes that they
may proﬁt alike by inspecting the in-

and by intercourse with men in active
engineering industrial work,.. many. Of

COUNCIL.

 

Alumni and Trustees of Pitt Among
Men Chosen to Goven Pittsburgh.

In the appointments by the Gover-
nor of the men who will constitute
the Council of the City of Pittsburgh,
signal honor has been given the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh. Cf. the.-nine
men appointed, four are closely con-
nected with‘ the University. E. V.
Babcock and A. J. Kelly,PJr., are at
the present time trustees of this in-
stitution, and it is a source of great
pleasure to all Pitt men to know that
these representatives of our school
have been chosen to serve on this im-
portant body. Senator Goehring and
D_r. Woodburn are among the gradu-
ates of this school. Then the Alum:li
Register. shows W. G. Wilkins to have
held the post of Adjunct Professor of
Mining Engineer from 1895 to\190f).

Certainly Pitt has secured a large
representation of this_ council. The
importance of this fact is enhanced
when it is taken into consideration

I that these men were chosen by the
_ Governor from the pick of the best and-
-brainiest business men in the city I

The men chosen are considered by
all parties to be thoroughly capable

,of managing the affairs of the cityi

in, a praiseworthy manner. The sttu
dent and alumni of Pitt are rejoicing
at the honor which has befallen thes:
