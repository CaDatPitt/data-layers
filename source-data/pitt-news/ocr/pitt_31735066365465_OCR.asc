Campus cops arrest nine on drugs

by BILL GORMLEY
Editor
Six Pitt students and three
Sewickley High School stu-
dents were arrested Thursday
in a Tower A room by campus

police for violating the Dan-

gerous Drug and Cosmetic Act.

The students, released on nom-
inal bail after being transported
to Varsity Hall, Station No. 4 in
Oakland, and Station No. 1, down-
town, are scheduled to appear at a
hearing Friday.

Campus police officers Greg
Mayes and Kenneth Andrews
made the arrest at 10:30 p.m. and
confiscated what Superintendent
of Campus Security Joseph Gil de-
scribed as "a substantial amount
of marijuana.”

According to Mayes, he and An-

drews were responding to a com-

plaint about a “disturbance” and
“something like the. possible
smoking of marijuana” in the
Tower A room. Andrews said the
radio call referred to a “distur-
bance and smoke coming from un-
der the door.”

The Resident Assistant on the
Tower A floor has denied that

there ever was a disturbance. "I
was here and my room was open
and I didn’t hear any noise." he
told the Pitt News yesterday.

According to Mayes, he and An-
drews proceeded to the room and
saw "smoke coming out of the
room.” Asked whether he could
differentiate between pot smoke
and fire smoke, Mayes said, “I’m
not in a position to say whether
it’s pot that‘s burning or a blanket
that’s burning.”

Outside the room, Mayes said,
was a student on a phone whose
extension cord led under the door
into the room. It was his room.
According to Mayes, the student
was asked, “Do you want to open
it up?” and the student said he
didn’t have a key. Andrews used
his master key to open the door,
Mayes said.

Inside the room, according to
Mayes, were eight students and a
"plastic bag” with marijuana "in
full view of the eye.”

The arrested students were un-
available for comment over the
weekend. They may give their ac-
count of what happened sometime
today in the presence of their law-

yers.

‘ﬁt 

booking of gynecologist appointments to a group of women.

In the meantime, the Head Resi-
dent of Tower A, Bob Redick, ex-
pressed outrage at the incident.

“What the police did." Redick
said, “is in totallviolation of the
University’s policy that the use
of drugs is a counseling matter,
not a law enforcement matter."

Redick said he understood that
the campus police would treat
drug users differently than drug
pushers.

The Resident.Assistant on the
floor where the arrest occurred
echoed Redick’s‘ comments. “We
were under the impression that
campus police wouldn’t bust stu-
dents who were using drugs in
their rooms . . . that they were
only interested in students who
were pushing the drugs.” ,

The RA told the Pitt News that
he had communicated that im-

pression to the students on his‘

floor.

"At the RA workshop." Redick
recalled, “Superintendent Gil

made ‘the statement that he saw
the use of drugs as a counseling
matter and the RA’s worked on
that assumption.”

Gil told the Pitt News Friday

Women protest Health Center’s
gynecological booking delays

by SUE HOENSTINE

Twenty-five women sat in at
the Health Center Friday morn-
ing to protest a temporary freeze
in the booking of gynecologist ap-
pointments.

In a memo released last week.
Dr. Joseph Hinchliffe, director of
the Student Health Center. an-
nounced that only emergency gy-
necological appointments would
be accepted until further notice.

Hinchliffe told the woman that
the student clinic is not cutting
back services, but is presently
booked six weeks in advance for
gynecological exams.

"When we‘re down to two weeks
we will open the books again.”
Hinchcliffe said. "In a similar
eight week period last year we
saw 189 (gynecology) patients.
This year we’ve seen 420 despite
that fact that we were closed for a
week to move our facilities from
the Nurse’s Residence."

The Center is already operating
at a 2.000-$4,000 monthly deficit
and Hinchliffe estimated the cost
of hiring another gynecologist to
be between $400 and $600 monthly.

Gail Hornstein, a member of
the Undergraduate, Women’s Un-_

 

fusal to offer services in’ accord
with rising student demand would
be perceived 'as“a direct affront
to the women on this campus.”

“The Health Center oughtto
respond to the needs of students
to the extent that they occur and
to the measure that they occur,”
Hornstein contended. “And if it
means cutting something out. it
means cutting something out."

Hinchliffe explained that al-
though one of the first to be affect-
ed, gynecology is not the only area
hit by the Health Centers fiscal
dilemma.

“There is presently a three-
week waiting list for a psychiatric
appointment,” Hinchliffe said.

He added that in January the
Center will begin charging for al-
lergy shots. pap smears. and phy-
sical examinations.

The women suggested the dis-
continuation of less critical serv-
ices like dermatology. The possi-
bilities of payment for special
services and a flat rate for health
care were also suggested.

One woman inquired as to the
existence of an emergency alloca-
tion fund within the University,
and"Marc Hiller, director of the

.-Health Service _.'Oi_jg_a-niza_tion',

    

said, “HSO is not necessarily go-
ing to buy the fact that there is no
money available within the Uni-

versity. When health care is in-.

volved it should supercede’ any
other function.”\

But according to Dan McFad-
den, executive assistant to the
Vice Chancellor of Public Affairs.
there are no funds available to in-
crease health service.

He told the Pitt News that the
University has already cut back
three million dollars in spending
and another cut of a half million
dollars could be forthcoming.

In October, McFadden said that
a request for additional funds by
Hinchliffe was refused by the ad-
ministration.

"His original budget was ac-
cepted as submitted. He has so
many dollars to work with and he
has to do with it what he can,”
McFadden said.

McFadden noted that the Health
Center already received a 50 per
cent budget increase this year to
cover remodeling costs. He sug-
gested charging a fee for health
care over the cost of tuition to fi-
'ance

 

the rising demands for —
ﬂhealth-car_e_.-j _  - « . —

that he considered the use of
marijuana “a medical, counseling
problem, that should be brought
to the campus judiciary.” Gil said
he would be in touch with those
responsible for the campus judici-
ary today.

According to Mayes. Gil was.

consulted before the students

were taken to Station No. 4 and

was asked for his opinion on the
‘matter.

Defending the arrest and the
referral of the students to the city
police. Mayes said the campus po-
lice would have committed felo-
nies themselves had they acted
outherwise. ~ I

“If the authorities did not take
these things through the specified
channels, we would be subject to
legal action ourselves,” Mayes
said. — ‘

‘Sergeant Walt Waters of Cam-
pus Security also justified the de-
cision. "We‘ve got to do a certain
job at this University so that the
city, the county, and the state are
all satisfied.'.’ he argued.

Bob Ging of the Student Asso-
ciation‘s Legal Awareness Com-
mittee agreed. “We feel the cam-

Nixon’s °Withd1'aWal’ 

pus" police didn’t violate the rights
of students,“ he said.

However, Redick criticized the
police for entering a locked stu-
dent room. “I’m opposed to the
University Police’s using a -mas-’

ter key to enter a room under any ’

circumstances,” he said. “It
should be cleared with the Head
Residentor John Vrana, the di-
rector of Housing.”

Accusing the police of “infring-

ing on student privacy." Redick '

argued that "the police have no
business in a student room, with-

out a search warrant or an arrest .

warrant.”

Redick further contended that‘ '.
the campus police "have destroyed, 

any credibility by their actions.”
He maintained that the "good re-
lations that the University Police

have established over the past two 
years have really suffered a set- a

back."

a

"The situation.“ Redick con-".10

cluded, “was poorly h'andled."‘He‘_
contended that the incident should

have been kept within the Univer- — 
sity—"not dropped but taken to V ’
Moye's office. Al Moye is the new'b_'7

   McGovern’ questions   

by HEIDI D. LEVIN

Senator George McGovern renewed his call for immediate and to-
tal withdrawal of all United States military personnel from Vietnam 

Sunday night before a capacity ‘crowd in Carnegie Music Hall.
McGovern (D.-S.D. ), a candidate for the presidency, sees no fun-

damental change in the current administrations Vietnam policy, des-f’,

pite President Nixon’s recent troop withdrawal announcement. ,

Ending the war, according to McGovern, means not just combat’
troop removal, but full withdrawal of all military personnel, including

military advisors.

a .

The Senator ‘brought an applauding audience to its feet when he ad-
vocated a general amnesty‘ for all men who have either left the country

or have been imprisoned because of their refusal to be inducted into

the army.

.VIcGovern said the time has come for the United States‘ to stop 0‘
"propping up military dictatorships all over the world” and to turn to-‘

the “healing and reconstruction of our own land."

Through _a drastic reduction of military expenditures and at redis- 
tribution of these funds to domestic programs, McGovern feels the un-

employment rate of the nation can be dropped to virtually zero.

McGovern envisions “useful, creative employment” through they
expansion of housing, educational, health and pollution control pro-’
jects. with major funding for these projects coming from monies which’-

would previously have been allocated to the military. ‘
McGovern reaffirmed his pledge to appoint a woman to the first

vacancy occurring on the Supreme Court should he be elected President.

The Senator also pledged to appoint women to the Security Coun-

cil and Cabinet positions.

Announcement was made by the Senator of the creation of a Na--'

_ tional Women’s Advisory Council
within his own campaign organ-
ization.

The Council will integrate wom-
en directly into ‘the organization,
avoiding a separate “women’s di-
vision." Inl'ormation and advice
on the issues, events, and individ-
uals of importance to women
would be provided for McGovern

, and his staff by the Council.

McGovern spoke of the “imper-

ative urgency” -for the Demo-'

cratic Party to -nominate a candi-
date in 1972 who will offer a
“genuine choice for those people
who are,against war.”

He added that in his opinion the

FREEDOM BUS: For thesurvival of all Jews.

Freedom Bus enlists
aid for Soviet Jewry.

by JUDY DECKER

The Soviet Jewry Freedom Bus,
a trans United States mobile dis-
play and resource center in the

, fight for Soviet Jewry, visited the

University Friday afternoon.

The bus is staffed by three
Americans and two Soviet Jews
who are attempting to make peo-
ple aware of the plight of Soviet
Jews.

The bus visits communities ac-
tive in the fight for Soviet Jewry
as well as those non-committed,
in hopes of. enlisting their aid.

In each community visited. the
staff organizes rallies with stu-
dents’and receptions with- adult
groups, work shops with student
leaders who may join the staff,
and circulates a student manifes-
to which will be sent to Washing-
ton i-n an attempt to convince

President Nixon to discuss the in- '

justices in his talks with Soviet
leaders. ‘

A crowd of'20 Pitt students
gathered around the bus. A mem-
ber of the bus’ staff said that they
usually have large student turn-
outs. ‘

The Americans of the staff in-

clude a second year med student,

another college student, and a re-
cently graduated nurse. The emi-
grees are also of student age.
They are dedicating their time be-
cause, as one member said, “I be-
lieve in the survival of all Jews.”

They also said that the bus was
worthwhile forit accomplished its
goals in‘ many cities. Committees
for Soviet Jewry have been set up
in many communities that the bus
has visited. '

The arrival of the bus in Pitts-
burgh is in conjunction with the
40th General Assembly of the
Council of Jewish Federations and
Welfare Funds.

Bell tolls for offenders A

Credit “phonics”   charged‘

by CAROLE COVAL

The Fraud Squad is here, and at
nearly every major university
from California to Florida. Bell
Telephone security agents -are
meeting‘ with student offenders of
Bell credit card and at-
tempting to resolvemonetary re-
paration without resorting to ar-
rests and co_nvictions.

A Bell security agent currently
working here said that he hopes
for an f‘amicable settlement be-
tween adults" with those students
who would have previously been
slated for a $100 fine and court
costs or a term of imprisonment
per call.

"Were .all basically [honest-."
he said, “but we may have a bit
of larceny in our hearts-"

He said the Bell Telephone/Com-
pany has lost approximately three
per cent of its total revenue from

-«fraudulent credit card calls.
Pennyslvania Bell, he said, has al-
ready lost nearly $2.5 million in
fiscal year 1969-1970.

In July, 1971. Bell initiated a
program of t'ace—to-face contact
between security agents and al-
leged offenders of Pennsylvania
Penal Code 898.1. which prohibits
fradulent use of credit cards.

The Bell agent said that 95 per
cent of his past two years of work

in the security department has-

been investigating credit card of-
fenses. Among the schoolswhere

Bob Ging. chairman of the Le-

that students who have consulted

with their treatment and would

Most of the inmates inter-

. viewed are enrolled in the Insti-

tution's educational College Pro-
gram. They are not'part of any
list approved or disapproved by
the administration: they were
men available and willing to dis-
cuss prison_life. As college stu-
dents well into their second
academic year, they are “prob-
ablygthe more articulate resi-
dents" of the prison, “the ‘cream
of the crop. so to speak." accord-
ing to Joseph Angert. Director
of Education. '

One of _the first things you no-
tice about these men is their
sense of personal responsibility
for improving the Institution.
Not so much ‘a necessity to re-
design the physical structure-
this they feel ‘will come in
time—but an urgency to create

a new psychological environ-

ment or eliminate the old.

“When you enter the prison,”-

an inmate, who has served 11
years on a life sentence, said,
"you are completely emasculat-
ed. They strip you and check
under your armpits’, your balls,
everywhere. You're left with
nothing and then they give you
everything . . K clothes, money,
just everything. Of course they
can drag you out of your cell
anytime for a check and you
know you really have nothing.
We understand. It’s for security.
But we don’t agree and it’s de-
humanizingf’, - ' ,
Unlike the’ prison administrator
who can separate his "work”
f'rom his‘ personal life, the in-
mate must live the Institution.

X As his sentence wears on. it
becomes

increasingly difficult
to disassociate the two. ’

Warden Joseph Brierley said,
".I once saw a man returned to

_the Institution after -being re-

      
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
  
 
  
 
  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
   
   
  
  
   
  
 
 
   

ing a man

leased and the only effect that
it had on him was that he asked
if he could have his old job
back and his old cell. since he
had fixed it up. Unfortunately.
some men become institutional-
ized like this. They have grown
dependent and comfortable be-
cause of the experience and
have obtained stature and pres-
tige in this situation.”

They have acquired a sense of
identity which in many cases
serves to mitigate the prison
experience. “What these young
kids must understand is that a
convict is a convict-,” the in-
mate-clerk in the ‘office preach-
ed. He has served time in a num-
ber of State and Federal prisons.
“When they admit they are pris-
oners and accept it and act like

“So I go for a job." Bills
shrugged, "and I say, I‘ve worked
on a metal press. ‘Can you "set
the dies?"they ask. ‘No, I can
sit there and press.’ ‘What else
can you do?’ ‘Nothing,’ I have
to tell them. ‘I can only put

Hell, they could easily train a

associate editors of Vibrations,

Bob Bills and Bob Jackson’
lpseudonames) sat in the empty
school house classroom. Both
men have done at least 10 years
in Western‘ Penitentiary—one for
murder and the other for armed
robbery. Both, are enrolled _in
the College Program and should

soon receive their Associate De-

grees.

"Until the (College) Program,”
Bills said, "I felt I was made
worse by prison. Since '55. I've
been in one institution after an-
other, from reform school to ju-
venile penitentiary, I feel that
education has stopped this cycle-
but what about all the other men
who don’t receive this oppor-
tunity? Only 60 men are enroll-
ed here and that’s a small, limit-
ed number. What about the
rest?". '

Aside from the College Pro-

.gram. Jackson and Bills say.

there is almost no rehabilita-
tion in the Institution. "In only
three areas,” Bills asserted.
"Can you really learn a trade-
the projection booth, the barber

shop, and the hospital. And we——_'
the inmates—had to fight to. get

the booth.”.

Bills, who was one of the or-’

ganizers of_ the now ‘defunct In-
mate Committee to Improve the
Institution, explained that he had
to go personally to Brierley to
get the projection booth opened.
"They had a guard in their run-
ning it and that’s a valuable
trade. Finally, on Brierley’s say
so, we were allowed to use it.
Since. four of us have gotten
our licenses." ‘

As part of their rehabilitation,
all inmates physically able, are
assigned jobs in Correctional
Industries.

“That’s a joke,” Jackson said,
“a sad joke. Correctional Indus-
tries—have you seen it? They

as an advisor with the paper,

selves. We told them what would
happen. that the paper might be
closed if they kept this up. but
they wouldn't listen."

"We just didn‘t want any form A

of censorship," Jackson demand-
ed, “and that is what they were
trying to do."

Jackson and Bills and many‘
other prisoners feel that anyone
who really tries to help the in-
mate and treat‘ him like a human
being, gets transferred. “Aus-
tin .(former Superintendent) set
up some good rehabilitation
programs,” Jackson said, “and
when'they saw what he was
doing, he got removed. It.has
been like that with everyone.”

"Yeah.They probably told you
not to believe anything we say.
Right? Something like that then.
So be careful!” Bills frowned,
trying to look sinister. "You know
we’re all liars and talk out of the

by VIRGINIA COOK

Last Thursday night, I was
assigned. to cover a meeting of
the Social Commission. I ap-
peared at the designated room
at the designated time, but
what I covered was not a meet-
ing; it was a fiasco.

It was not an assembly of ra-
tional people discussing budget
requests with any perception

"or, understanding. It was a.
meeting of Commissioners .
who have become drunk on the‘
wine of power‘, and their al-
coholism is _a disease from‘

t which the whole studentgov-‘

-ernment is suffering, unknow-
ingly. _

When a quroum offive members
was present, themeeting was,con-_
vened. It had been six weeks
since the Commission had last
met. Some of the requests» that
they were to consider had been
submitted in September. And yet,
only five members showed up.

There were Xerox leaflets on
one of the tables,outliningall the
requests and recommendations.
Two of the commission members,
Diane-rNickel and Linda Milovats
didn’t even bother to pick them
UP- \ . _

I was the only one who took
‘notes at the meeting, and I was
the only one who took the Xerox
leafletshome with me.

No recording secretary was pre-
sent, and although Lenny Klavonic
did appoint -Milovats to take notes,
when the meeting adjourned, I
was still the only one.who’had any
record of what had taken place.

There were no minutes of pre-
vious meetings available, and

when a question on the Hill Edu- '

cation Project called for a refer-
ral to previous minutes], we had to
rely- on Klavonic’s‘ cluttered six
week memory. '

But even these parlimentary

descrepancies could have- been '
overlooked if the meeting had‘ .

been conducted in an adult man-
ner. But as one student whoiwas
present _.told me later, “It was

the most childish thing I’ve seen"

since I’ve left junior highschool.”

And he was right. When a WPGH
staffer presented the station’s ra-

 tionale for cartridge tape ma-

chine, Denny Concilla lashed out
at him and screamed, “Shut ‘up,
Demetri.;1‘.'ry9p dumb GjreekI§"If i_t_

Concilla fina1ly’_:.ea1med down
enough for me to a’§k*a few clari-
fying’ ques”ti'ons. It had become

h’avje been a few fists fly-’

evident, since"???-‘*"was the only one ‘

taking notes, that I was from the

‘ ' Pitt News.

In answer to question, Nick-

. el told me, "Why 'don’t you shut

up? You have no business being
here asking. questions." When I
ignored her and repeated the
question, Concilla came out with
another piercing, “Shut up." I
was spared Demetri’s ethnic
slight because Denny didn’t know‘
myname. - .

Again I repeated the question. I
“What’s the matter? Are you a

freshman or something?’f Wade,

Lawson asked.
“No,” I snapped back.

“Is this the first story you’ve
ever covered for the Pitt News?

“No,” I repeated, even louder.

By this time Lenny knew that
if he didn’t answer myquestion he
would be there until midnight. So
I got my answers.

WPGH kept talking about its
transmitters and about its UPI
wire machine. This prompted
Concilla to remark, “_Yeah, come

_to think of it, we allocated $20,-
.. 000 dollars for an AP machine for

the Pitt News, and in the last
week, ‘I’ve only seen two‘- AP
stories in the whole paper.”

(Editor's Note: The Pitt News re-
quested and received $1,537.)

“Yeah,” Klavonic replied, look-
ing straight at me ‘and shaking his
finger vehemently. “You just wait
until the Pitt News allocations re-
quests come up next year. See if
they get that $20,000 again.”

Klavonic and Concilla began to

playparliamentary tricks. Lawson
had voiced dissatisfaction that no

fare. was to be charged on the buss-
es to the hockey club games.
While Lawson was out of the room
answering the phone‘ the Commis-
sign _ passed the Hockey Club

transportation requests. ,

Milovats had been vehemently,

opposed to any Pantherette allo-
cation. But she was so eager to get
out, to have the meeting over
with, that she was‘ still arguing
with Mike -Poremba as she was"
putting on her coat, going “out the
door. These commission mem-
bers ‘only meet every six weeks,
and even then they don't want to
take the time to consider the re-
quests thoughtfully.

Poremba summed up thewholé
meeting pretty well when he said,

n "I need a stiff drink.”

I wanted to‘ getout of thereas‘
fast as I could, too. But Klavonic
caught me by the cuff and asked
me if this time perhaps the Pitt
News would give his committee
objective coverage. I told him
he’d get it from me.

I told him we had given him his
chance in “The Klavonic Pa-
pers,” and I asked when I could
expect to see his next installment.
His reply was .“there’s so much
misinformation in the Pitt -News
already, I just donft give a damn.”
And -that’s a direct quote. Klavon-
ic looked over my shoulder when
I wrote it down.

Perhaps the trouble is that the

Pitt‘ News has‘ been giving Len- '

ny’s committee a _brea_k. We have
been giving him the cut -and dried
stories that journalism demands.
:But journalism also demands that
when a reporter sees a fiascolike
the one on Thursday night that the
reporter tell the student body that
is paying $12 a year in student ac-

tivity fees, exactly, right down to

the last shut up, what is going on.

Lenny, told my editor that he
hopes I am not assigned to cover
his meetings anymore. I ask too
many questions,’I stick my nose- in
too many places, I don't shut up
when I am told to_do so.-

I will“ not shut up whilethe stu-
dents of this University" are being
maligned by a Commission that is

“irresponsible, uncooperative, and '
unconcerned. I was shocked. ap-

zpalled, and sickened by what I
saw, last Thursday evening.

The student government I saw,
in action is "terribly inadequate
and inept at handling the needs of
the student body it was elected to

' serve. There is a movement on
this-. campus to adopt a new con- ’

.stitution, a new form of student
government. I urge all of -you to
become interested in this alterna-
tive to the fiasco I saw and re-

" Strange days have tracked us

The beginning of “Down on the
Farm,” if one ignores the vocals,
could be rather pretty, but when

the trio switches to “down home”-

vocalization with ba cking to
match, one wonders whether their
minds have come unhinged.

People are strange, and if the
trio fails to undergo an abrupt
about face, their legions of loyal
followers may dwindle quite
abruptly. For the Doors have clos-
ed the volume in which they will
be recorded in rock annals. In
light of this effort, Morrison held
the keys to the kingdom for the
then-quartet, but that kingdom
has crumbled with his demise.

Home, for Ivan Denisovich, is a
special Stalinist camp for politi-
cal prisoners in frigid Siberia.

Work is exhausting labor, be-
ginning before sunrise, lasting
through the 27 degree below zero
day, and ending when it is finished.

Food is boiledxgrass.

Freedom -is, the freedom to
scavenge, or if your are not skill-
ful, the freedom to starve.

Does Denisovich denounce the
injustice that has kidnapped his
manhood and holds it ransom in
this place where hell has frozen
over? I

“No,” he says, “we have good
lives. At least we are not among
murderers and thieves.” I

PEOPLE LIKE US

If you can believe your eyes
ears, and strain both senses, you
might discern a style familiar as
it is unique. The fabled Mamas
and the Papas have re-emerged as
a distinct entity, with their long-
awaited “together again” record-
ing, People Like Us.

The bittersweet blends of melo-
dic splendor have grown increas-
ingly rare, but the quartet has
nevertheless delivered an ex-
tremely listenable collection.

It appears, though,-that we have
bid a fond farewell to the gold-
en era—for one quickly perceives
the clink of coins as likely to have
been the predominant sound he-
hind these sessions.

a habit — will probably prevent
the film from becoming a box of-
fice smash.

For if it is thought-provoking,
powerful, revealing Denisovich is
also boring. No guards beat Den-
isovich bloody for his crimes
against the State. Spiritless pris-
oners plot no escapes through the
stark Siberian wasteland. Even
remembering their former lives,
the prisoners speak mechanically,
as if detached from the people
they once were.

The terror of the prison camp
as depicted in ‘the film is its numb-
ing dehumanization of the prison-
ers. Stripped of their memories
and aspirations’, identified offi-
cially by number, the prisoners
are left with only .a blind, undra-
matic instinct for survival.

IPVr'oducer/Director Kaspar
Wrede meticulously, transcribes
Alexander Solzhenitsyn’s novel to

‘V > J.” A,  ‘ Va”,

To a disheartening degree, slick
commercialism has replaced the
casual precision of earlier record-
ings. And a distinct sense of “deja
vu” pervades all to many cuts.

Which is not to say that all is
for naught. Amid the dim shadows
of former glories, a few fresh mo-
ments of breathless beauty shat-
ter the stillness.

“Snow Queen of Texas” is a de-
lightfully understated number,
notably featuring an indescribable
vocal interchange conveying a
painful yet sweet message. “Step

‘ Out” is another lovely composi-

tion, with its slight lyrical inade-
quacies easily overcome by the
pleasant melody.

A charming number penned bv

the screen. 'l'he ice on the mus-
tache, the fish eye swimming in
Denisovich’s soup, the gaps where
his teeth used to be, Wrede cap-
tures nearly every detail of the
novel.

And in so doing loses part of his
audience. I'don’t know if the peo-
ple at the Shadyside Theatre Fri-
day night expected gory cathar-
sis, or whether we have become
so familiar with atrocities that
evil’s'banality escapes our wrath.

In either case, people left the
theater, without discovering the
lurking terror in Denisovich’s
erosion.

Perhaps as a sop to his audi-
ence, Wrede adds a narrator to
explain the rituals of I the camp
and a gloomy Russian choir for a
dirge or two. Both are tawdry and
ineffectual.

Also ineffectual is-.V'Torn Cour-

Michelle, “I Wanna Be a Star," is
perhaps not so clever as it is cute,
with an almost pouting, “pretty
please” vocal ‘and phrases like,
"Mister Producer, please don’t
seduce her," likely as not to draw
out a chuckle.

With the exception of the direct
hit scored by “Shooting Star,” the
remainder of the disc disappoints
the discriminating listener—but
the overall impression is one of
hopeful patience for what may yet
be achieved.

So if you can’t afford to shell out
for this purchase, dial your local
station and request they spin the
platter. And dedicate it to the one
you love.

“Denisovich’s” final horror - there is none

syn’s Denisovich is a scrappy,
cagey scrounger well-versed in
the art of camp survival. (He has,
after all, survived.) Courtenay
stumbles about, eyes filmy and
vacant, never seeming to know
what he is doing or why he is doing
it.

The few instances Courtenay
comes to life provide the keenest
insights of the film. Here we see
the awfulness of the prison camp,
in Denisovich’s struggle for sur-
vival. -

Neither noble nor base, the
struggle for life - simply _is,. a
thoughtless, purposeless process
disembodied from the spirit long-
since frozen to death.

It is life without living, torture
without pain,. and -the most un-
speakable horror of all, is that
there is no horror.

Pitt News Drama Critic

f'Gift Horse’ rides on  



I both to her talent as a writer and to her success, in

by J.E. ONAITIS

The Gift Horse is a literary collage of war-horror and Holly-.

wood glamour, marvelously worked together as the autobiography
of Hildegard Knef.

In a style that is at once moving, humorous and cynical, the
author relates a history that begins in 'pre-Hitler Germany and
ends in the serenity of marriage and motherhood. Spliced between
is the off-camera story of her career in the theater and the film
industry.

Movie business is thesetting for a good two-thirds of the book;

included are scenes of ‘stars’ minus their (glitter and a ‘facade-de-

molishing description of Hollywood.

. Hildegard Knef has written her “report on a life” in terms of
its complexities, a.quality which makes it a vivid and memorable
biography. World War II is a series of air-raids spent in Berlin
cellars‘. The daughter of a non-political shoemaker, she carries on
an illicit affair with a Nazi official. After escaping from a Russian
prison camp, she marries a Jewish-American soldier and leaves
Germany for the States and the lure of film contracts. ’

In detailing her years as a movie actress, the author shatters

the absurd vanity of the cinema-deities; she narrates the hard"

climb to success in terms of poverty, prejudice, notoriety and l0nli-
ness. - '

At no time does the author lose her sense of .perspective and
value. The picture of Hitler’s Germany is not overdrawn with ‘fear
and terror; irony and humor survive even the grim ordeal of Russian
takeover. '

Neither does stardom seem the overwhelming all of Knef’s life.-

The portraits of a mother,a grandfather, husbands and friends dwarf
to a mere mention great names of the silver screen. , -
‘In all, the book is." a self-exclaimed tribute to,Hi1degard Knef-
spite of over-
whelming odds, as a human being. ‘

British playwright. The humor
and locale of the play are the
same. There is wit and.fun, but
a little “different” from Ameri-

‘ can taste.

It is also very much 1941. At
the time it was written, life was
much- slower and the pace, at
leastin Coward’s circles, a bit
more sluggishly elegant. When

first presented in the U.S. it was-

an interesting contrast from
across the sea, yielding a plot
that invited a soft brandy" and
perhaps a watercress on rye.
Blithe Spirit‘ is that type ‘of
“elegant” comedy. It takes
its good time getting going,

‘mellows a bit, takes off then

mellows again—engages for
awhile, and then takes off
toward a rather tidy ending.
It is a comedy of "the tri-
angle.” — ’

Ruth and Charles hold a‘ din-
ner party. Madame Arcati, a
medium, provides her enter-
tainment. She materializes the
ghost of Charles’s first wife,
Elvira, who floats around in the
midst of the ever—present second
wife.

The second Mrs. Condomine

is already jealous of the depart-_

ed Elvira’s charms when, El-
vira, trying to take Charles back
with her into the__ _bey0nd, un-

‘Blithe Spirit‘ takes off   
gBut floats away uninspired

wittingly brings
death instead. .
After Madame Acati mater-
ializes the second wife, the
play delivers its most humorous
moments. It is a triangular ghost
story ‘that oozes along at irregu'—
lar’ speed. When it’s up, Spirit
is fine,-but when it’s just get-
ting you there-’—you start to thank
the Playhouse for the comfort-
able new seats that lend them-
selves nicely to just drifting off.
One of the better things about
the show is the cast. Helen
Wayne Raugh (Madame Acati)
is energetic and vivacious in the
role of the medium’. She zips
through the play with much in-
spiration and takes off here and
there for ..some delightful mo-

about Ruth’s

merits. - .

Ellen ’ Pettersoin as __,‘Edith
(Maid) delivers a very well
done caricature providing humor
when it is most needed. Daniel
Mooney as Charles is accom-
plished in his role. His por-
trayal is nicely conceived and
quite fine in interpretation.

Doris Hackney, (Ruth), and
Peggy Ann Hughes (Elvira),
are each delightful. Although
Hackney seemed to have some
trouble remembering her lines
here and there, she gives a super-
ior performance as the second

 
 

  
 
 
  

wife.

Barbara Orwid (Mrs.
man) and David Emge (Dr.
Bradman). both lend fine. sup-
port in minor roles.

Direction
Mayer is very well done. The
show is nicely stated and is
paced with a great deal of bal-
ance.

Mayer manages to move things i A 
along smoothly (not too fast 

and not too slow) without sacri-

ficing the more subtle moment. *-
At the same time he preserves  
«the brighter ones. In

Mayer has given “Blithe”-

Spirit” all ‘it can have "without 
severe cuts, updating, or i'.e-  

writing.

Settings by Mary Ellen Ken- 
nedy are nicely conceived; as 
are costumes by Jim ,Chesnutt _ 

and lighting by Pat Simmons.

Blithe Spirit is an interesting * 

comedy. It is not altogether-dull——

neither is it very inspiring. -Itr M"):

is very much Noel Coward.

It will continue at the Pitts-
burgh Playhouse through Decem-
ber 4. ‘ ' _ ’

West Point, NY— As Jim Bar-

the Cadet cannon boomed and
the Pitt hopes for a comeback

cise margin that the oddsmakers
had spotted the Panthers.

As the Army punter prepares to kick the football, hund-
reds of Pitt Panther gridiron fans, their ears filled with the
sound of radio announcer Ed Conway’s static-laden voice,
can sense the impending Cat drive for the game-winning
field goal by Eric Knisely in the waning moments of the
contest.

Seconds later, with Conway sputtering away, the Cadets
still have possession of the pigskin, thanks to the generosity

My roommate and I are dazed and bitter. Undoubtedly,
Pitt has fumbled away its last shot at a mediocre campaign.
Shuffling out of the room, my roommate snarls, “Christ,
it’ll be great to get out of here in April. I couldn’t stand
' another year of this crap (Pitt football).”

A quick (and possibly rash) estimate of the annual Pitt
football budget, including coaches’ salaries, player scholar-
ships, travel expenses, etc., would be in the neighborhood of

‘Q~$350,000-$400,000. By 10:30 p.m. November 27, the gridders

will most likely have suffered their ‘eighth defeat of the

season. I believe that $1.4 million is
a lot of dough to spend on a sport
that doesn’t even have a winning per-
centage of .333 over». the past four
years.

Who do you blame? Is it the ball-
players, the coaching staff, or the
athletic department‘? A triumverate
appears to be the culprit.

Saturday’s loss was indirectly the
result of a weak Panther secondary.
The last two Army scoring drives
resulted from two key 30 yard pass-
es. The entire 1971 season has been

 

“CH LINKY” SIGMON

Too many Pitt players lack both the individual pride
and ability necessary for a major football power. Execution
has been clearly non-existent at times. Every time a Panther
player has been interviewed this year, he has admitted that
“fumbles and interceptions have hurt us.” After nine games,
is the end in sight? '

Coach Carl DePasqua is often chided for being too con-
servative. Yet he greatly contributed to Army’s victory. Twice
in the second half, Panther (Lou) Cecconi, in single safety,
had allowedpunts to roll dead. Then, with less than two
minutes in the contest, he attempted _to field a short Cadet
punt, and fumbled. Coach DePasqua should have ordered
Cecconi to stay away from the ball. What’s more, why put
all that pressure, on a sophomore? '

Athletic Director Casimir Myslinski is the Hans Christi-
an Anderson of Pitt football. He has reiterated that Pitt foot-
ball fortunes are on their way up, for the past three years.
I guess he is right—-3-8 is better than 1-9. Myslinski should
order DePasqua to crack down on the widely-known extra-
curricular activities of several gridders. Instead of flying
the Chancellor, Mayor Flaherty, other public officials and
alumni to every Panther away contest, why not increase the

A paltry pay of the equipment managers and ground crew?

j _ The least_._an .article‘..like.g‘this‘ one

I mean this piece of journalism to be constructive criti-
cism. The Pitt Panthers face their toughest opponent this
Saturday at Pitt Stadium. Penn State is good. They are well-
coached and well-drilled.

But up in the clouds somewhere, maybe in a far away
galaxy, a dreaming scribe named"‘Chunky” feels that the’
Cats can pull an upset similar to the one in 1965, when Pitt
upended the Nittany Lions, 3,0-27. -

The play that boosted Havern

in the first half, capped the
quick drive with a perfect pass

was upheld on Saturday as the
Penn State Nittany Lions played

their customary role as the spoil- «

GI‘.

The Pitt soccer ‘squad was de-
voured by the Lions, 5-1 in the
final match for both teams of
the ‘71 season, thus ending Pitt’s
chances for a bid to the N.C.A.A.
playoffs. ’

Both teams realized it was a
‘winner takes all‘ game in their
fight for a bid to the tourna-
ment. ~

“Penn State should be picked
for the tournament now,” relat-
ed Pitt’s coach Leo Bemis. “Their
performance will bear it out.”

"‘They’re just a good ball team.
When they got the ball we really
had to work to get it back.” V

Not indicated ‘by the final
score is the fact that the booters
were in the game until the end
of the third period.

In ‘the first half the teams
were fairly evenly matched—PSU
dominated the first period while
Pitt commanded the second.

The defense contained the re-‘
putedly explosive Lion offense
until. with 20:06 gone in the
second period, Ciro Baldino
netted the first score. But Pitt

made his share of good plays."

The defense, however, was
unable to withstand the continu-
ous pressure generated by the

' Lions. The third goal scored by

PSU was critical and became the-
turning point of the game;

Pitt eyes openings in IC4A’s

Trying to pick a favorite in to-

end. one winner inevitably will
have arisen.
The race will be tougher than

most cross country races for a lot .

of reasons. First of all, a better
collection of cross country ath-
Ietes cannot be found in any one
other eastern meet, ‘according to
harrier Coach Jim Banner.

And. when you consider that 40
schools, most of which send four
or five runners. are competing.
Van Courtland Park will be the
site of a mild traffic jam.

Experience could turn out to be
the deciding factor in determin-
ing a victor. Pitt‘s assistant cross
country and track coach. Don
Mollenhauer. who has seen a good
number of meets. shed a little

light on what the runner will ex-
perience in the eastern classic.

“It’s a big field,” said Mollen-

hauer. “The runners will have to
know how to get out of the pack.
You’ve got to know how to move
in a meet this big. If you don’t, the
results are fatal.

"The first mile or mile and a '

half will be very important. To
finish high. you’ve got to avoid
getting bogged down, keep watch-
ing for the openings. and keep
moving."

Villanova. who is always the.

favorite. faces a tough test. A de-
feat at the hands of Penn State
earlier in the season clouds their
dominance. Penn and Manhattan

are also very strong teams and
could emerge victorious.-

For Pitt, six harriers will be

looking for their openings. ‘Dave -

Szabat, Mike and Bob Schurko,
Dave Chesebrough, Bob Steele
and‘ John Black are among the
large contingent.

Mickey Collins.‘ did not
make the trip because of an injury
to his ankle, butaheatthy
John Black could prove to be an
adequate replacement.

"Without Collins were weak-
ened," said Mollenhauer. "Our

chances hinge on John Black’s
comeback. He has been having
knee problems.” 1

C. Browns cop crown

Charlie Brown reversed roles
with the Dorms this year by
winning the All—Campus Soft-
ball Championship by defeat-
ing House of the Midnight
Hour 21-11, on a balmy autumn
Sunday afternoon.

Last Year Mad House the
Dorm—F‘raternity representative
topped the Charlie Browns.

The apparent football score
was the result of some shoddy
fielding by both teams.

“This is the first time any-'

figures against us,” related
Charlie Brown manager Art
Parks. '

"'l\leither team played up to
their potential." commented
John Molinari. ‘

Both of these statements were
supported‘ by Mark Obenreiber‘s
eight errors. This is more errors
that he canremember having in
four games combined.

But his glove wasn’t what the
Charlie Browns .used as his bat
tallied nine runs-batted in, scor-

run andlfour doubles.

"It was just one of those
days when you’re just having
fun,” explained Obenreiber who
figured in every run the Charlie
Browns scored.

Inevitably, as Monday rolls around, I find myself con-
fronted with a barrage of questions concerning the Panthers’
weekly fiasco. Somehow I’m supposed to know why those
gridiron greats do what they do. Perhaps the question should
be how? I assume today will be no different after Saturday’s
heartbreaker’ at West Point. ‘

And frankly} every week my answer is the same, ‘if I
knew I’d be coaching the team.’ Oh sure, I may throw in
:an- astute comment or two to brush off my inquisi-.irs, but

H7.,_,in reality, I don’t think anyone knows what ails the Pan-
‘‘ “thers.

It’s no wonder that a good many wrinkles have creeped
.- into the visage of Coach Carl DePasqua during the last
three years, not to mention his vain attempts to ‘wash away
that" gray.’ Coaching Pitt is certainly a trying experience-
one that has proved almost futile since the rekindled glory
of the early sixties. ' \
Last Tuesday at the weekly Pitt football luncheon,‘ an
_ AP reporter was grilling De Pasqua on his football philo-
Qsophy. He, the reporter, was interested to see" whether, with
three games left (now two), and so disappointing a show-
ing so far this, season, DePasqua was ready to alter his_phil-
osophy in an effort to stem the tide. .

DePasqua replied that never before in his life has he
been at such a loss for answers. He’s forced to go with what
he has and produce miracles atthe same time. He is con-

" stantly looking for ways to patch up the gaping holes that
permeate the different facets of Pitt’s game, usually with
little success; Granted, the changes aren’t drastic, like switch-

 ing to the shotgun or the wishbone-T, but they are signifi-
cant in the context of Panther football.

The 5-2 defense was instituted because Pitt just doesn’t

Then there are the small but significant week-to-week
adjustments. John Chatman practicing the art of holding onto
the ball only to forget his lessons when the test rolls around
