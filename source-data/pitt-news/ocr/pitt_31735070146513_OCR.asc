Test prep, studyhabits no joke

Shaé Felicien
For The Pitt News

Homework is hard, but staying focused is hard-
er. .

At least, that is what most Pitt students seem
to think.

The struggle to keep on top of their work-
load-and the procrastination that can result
from poor planning are major issues for some
Pitt students.

“When I get an assignment, I think, ‘Delay

it for as long as possible,”’ freshman Whitney
_ Allen said. ’

Allen is not the only student who reported
such sentiments. V

“Morethananything, the problemthatlhave
is procrastination, justbeginningto startto study
iswhat reallyhinders my success moresothanmy
social life,” junior Humza Salim said.

James Cox, director ofPitt’s Counseling Center,
said procrastinating often ﬁirther fuels anxiety.

“Anxiety is caused from worry, so if a student
has an assignment and they put it off, then it’s an-
otherthingto worry about and anxiety increases,”
he explained. “Procrastination becomes a habit
for [some students], butwhen people ﬁnishwork
ahead oftime, they’re less stressedwhen it comes
time for exams.”

RebeccaAkinlosotu, afreshman engineering
major and self—proclaimed procrastinator, said
that waiting until the last moment to complete
assignments often means sacriﬁcing quality in
order to reach the deadline.

Contraryto what some students believe, pro-
fessors can often tell when a student puts off an
assignment until the last minute. According to
John Gareis, acommunications professor at Pitt,
two of the biggest indicators are proofreading
errors and arriving to class late because of long
lines at the computer lab. ‘

Procrastination does notalways reﬂectpoorly
upon a student’s grade, though. Whether they
procrastinated or not, what really matters is

whetherastudent’s work meets classstandards, ,

Gareis said.
“I always grade on content and style anyway,”
he said. “Ifthe style is not up to par, it doesn’t

matter when itwas done, two weeks ago or at the
last minute. The only time I grade more harshly
iswhen the assignmentis absolutely late. As long
as they get it in on the deadline and it’s done well,
they getthe grade.” ' .

Beginning an assignment can be the biggest
challenge, but many students also struggle with
staying on track once theyive begun.

“You’ll be studyingandyou’ll see people walk-
ing by looking like they’re enjoying life, and you
say to yourself, ‘I-Iey.I want to go enjoy life too,’
instead of reading about physics,” Akinlosotu
said. “Andtl1enyou wind up textingyourfriends,
,‘Hey, let’s go do something?’

' idea to take study breaks,” Chirdon-Iones said

SGBto
pick new
members  
tonight

Katherine Sandler
For The Pitt News

Pitt’s Student Government Board will ﬁll
its two vacancies at its meeting tonight in
Nordy’s Place after a question-and—answer
session with the candidates and a private
vote by the Board.

The Board received 10 applications for
the open positions, two of them from fresh-
men who may be ineligible for the seats
vacated earlier this year by former Board
members Ali Noorbaksh and Phil LaRue.

In an e-mail, SGB president Charlie Shull
said the candidates will be -interviewed as
a group during the Board meeting. Shull
said candidates will have to demonstrate
their familiarity with the Board’s active
projects, allocations policies and the over-
all procedure for allocating the Student
Activities Fee. _ -

He added that the board must interview
all candidates publicly and cannot sepa-
rate them or interview them one at a time,
thereby providing an unfair advantage to
later candidates.

The SGB constitution states in Article
IV, Section III,.that “a vacancy on the Board
not caused by a dismissal shall be ﬁlled by
a simple majority vote of the total member-
ship of the Board after each candidate has
been publicly interviewed.” ‘

SGB bylaws state nominees shall be ap-
proved by a simple majority vote of the total
membership of the Board. '

there are two freshman candidates that

have not yet generated a QPA at Pitt, and.

therefore do not meet one of the eligibility
requirements. C

After the meeting concludes tonight, the
Board will privately select which two appli-

cants to appoint. Shull said the remaining I

candidates will be ranked in case the two"
chosen are unable to serve.

Oﬂicial appointments of the two selected
members will occur at the following week’s
meeting on Sept. 28.

Prior to the public meeting, the Board

_ reviewed applications submitted by the po-

tential members, and SGB adviser Kenyon
Bonner checked each candidate’s eligibility
using Peoplesoft data, including major, QPA
and academic holds.

Shull said Bonner checks this data every
semester for all serving board members
to make sure they are still eligible to sit
on the Board.

There are three main criteria that deter-
mine an applicant’s eligibility, Shull said.
The applicants must be in good standing
with the University, have a QPA greater
than 2.5 and be enrolled as a full-time non-
College of General Studies major.

As of Monday afternoon, Shull said he
had not heard the University administra-
tion’s position on the freshman applicants.
Shull believes the freshman will most likely
be unable to serve without a QPA, but en-
couraged them to attend the public meeting
to be interviewed.

it is important that the freshmen are
represented in a way that we have
not been before. Also, I will empha-
size more student involvement and
attempt to curb the apathy that has
washed over today’s college students.
Students, especially freshmen, are not
given the opportunity to realize that
they can make a difference and so
resign themselves to hooking up and
drinking. It is important "for them to
realize this opportunity. However, at
the same time, many students do not
know what is good for them due to the
culture that we live in, so I will strive
to make decisions that are good for
the students now and in the future, at-
tempting to make these college years
the-best possible, but not the best

working with to make improvements
at Pitt. SGB is taking great strides
to increase transparency within the
board and increase participation in
the student body at large. Having been
a veryactive member of the student
body for two years, I have seen where

the disconnect between SGB, student

John Hasley, junior history and

Pitt improves in international rankings

Times Higher Education ranks Pitt among the -top 20 US public universities.

' Tegan Hanlon
For The Pitt News

Pitt jumped past almost 50 other universi-
ties to a world ranking in the 60s this year,
according to a British publication.

The University of Pittsburgh was ranked
15th among U.S. public universities, 38th
out_of all U.S. universities and 64th world-
wide by a Times Higher Education World
University Rankings .issued Sept. 16.

Pitt’s standing worldwide has jumped
from its placement as 114th in the world

for 2009 and 97th in the world for 2O08’s‘ :

rankings in the publication.

Times Higher Education analyzed the
schools based on ﬁve criteria including
teaching, international mix, industry in-
come, research and citations.

Thomson Reuters, home to over 12,000
journals dating back to 1900, provided the
data used in the magazine’s tables. Richard
Reynolds, a researcher for Times Higher
Education, said the researchers were able

to use this information to calculate how  -

often academics were cited. ’
“The magazine’s researchers came up
with the system. However, the rankings are

a result of consultation with a huge range ’ 1

of people,” Reynolds said. .
Reynolds said that an editorial board
made up of worldwide experts in higher
education and a platform group of 50 lead-
ers in higher education provided feedback
on the researchers’ methodology.
“Our method is extremely quantitative.

« We believe our tables give a fair showing

to the public sector ofthe United States,”

»Reynolds said:  

Studentleaders and administrators ap-
plauded Pitt’s jump in rankings.

“It’s interesting to look at the tradition
and history of Pitt,” Student Government
Board president Charlie Shull said about
the rankings. “It was 15 years ago when the
University started to turn itself around. If
you look at the population of the student
body in 1995 in the Honors College, it is
comparable to what the general popula-
tion is today.” ’

Pitt Provost Patricia Beeson approved
of the ranking and was quoted in an e-mail
from Pitt spokesman John Harvith.

“It is very rewarding to have our
strengths and our efforts recognized by
others,” she said. “The University has a

' very strong community of students, staff

and faculty, and we invest our limited re-

sources both carefully and strategically.” . i

President of the Graduate, and Profes-
sional Student Assembly Nila Devanath
cited student research and student life
as two improvements at the University in
the past year. c

“I think the advent of the OCC has

{helped to get all undergrads involved. It

gives them an incentive — something
tangible to be able to show a degree to

an employer,” Devanath said.

Pitt is not the only ranked school in the
Oakland area: Carnegie Mellon, ‘a private
university, placed 16th in the nation over-
all and 20th in the world.

“Carnegie Mellon University’s rating
as a top university in the world validates
many of the wonderful things we know
about this institution — it is a strong global

burgh,” Ken Walters, CMU’s senior media
relations director, said.

In the past decade, Pitt and CMU have
collaborated on hundreds of projects such
as the Pittsburgh Life Sciences Green-
house, the Center for the Neural Basis
of Cognition and Pittsburgh Science of
Learning Center, officials from both uni-
versities said. V

“These innovations have signiﬁcantly

raised the quality of life in the region and
beyond,” Walters said.

Some Pitt students were not surprised
by Pitt’s impressive performance.

“Am I shocked that we’ve placed 38 out
of all universities in the country while
Penn State came in at number 61 and West
Virginia is missing from the list? Not at
all,” sophomore Kathryn Boyk said. “Ev-

Pitt offers many study resources

As midterrns approach, many students face
mounting piles of work — and less ﬁme to ﬁn-
ish it.

Students canturnto avariety ofPittresources
to help with their school work and to cope with
the stress that comes along with it.

Pitt offers tutoring through the Academic
Resource Center, counseling through the Uni-
versity Counseling Center and other study ser-
vices through the Writing Center and the Math

' Assistance Center.

' Michael Chirdon—Jones, thetutorcoordinator
for the Academic Resource Center, recommends

that students who are struggling to form produc-
tive study habits visit the Academic Resource
Center. — ’

“I would certainly advise students if they are
ﬁndingtheirwork challengingto come to the ARC
for tutoring, or to attend a study skills workshop
if they want to work on a speciﬁc skill or study
habit,” Chirdon—jones said.

The Academic Resource Centerprovides free
tutoring to students in a variety of subjects. It is
open from 8:30 am. to 7 p.m., Monday through
Thursday and untils pm. Friday accordingto their
website. There are also a number of study skills

workshops aimed at helping students set goals,
manage time, develop better study techniques
and prepare for exams.

For students experiencing anxiety and stress
related to academic work or major and career
choices, the Counseling Center offers conﬁden-
tial personal and group counseling. The center is
located in 334 of the William Pitt Union.

The Writing Center located in M—2 of Thaw
Hall can be a valuable resource when it comes to
strengthem'ngwriting skills.

“I’ve seen everythingfrom students who come
in for walk—in sessions immediately after their
workis assignedallthe waythrough studentswho

comeinthedayorhoursbeforetheirassignment '

is due because they need someone to look over it,”
Chris Duerr, a seniorwho has tutored at the Writ-
ing Center for the past three years, said.

The Math Assistance Center, located on the 3rd

j ﬂoor ofThackeray Hall, offers tutoringinallmath

subjects by wall<—in sessions or appointments. ’

The Counseling Center also provides anurnber
of “Stress Free Zone” activities ranging from arts
and crafts to Guitar Hero and karaoke. The center
also offers yoga in the lower level of the Union.

Interested students can join the “Stress Free

formation on upcoming events. _

become a “study vacation.”

Joelle Urquhart, a sophomore, said that the A
Internet in general can be a big distraction that q

breaks up study time.
“I ﬁnd myselfconstantly checking Facebook,

checking e—mail and reading the news online,”

Urquhart said.
Studybreaks maybe helpful or not, depending
on what a student does with them.

“Ifsurﬁngthe net or talking to afriend on the '

phone is what causes a student to procrastinate,
I wouldn’t suggest that they indulge in that activ-
ity,” Cox said. “Go get something to eat, exercise
or take a walk — do something that relaxes you
and doesn’t take too much time.”

Chirdon—Jones had some recommendations
for how studentscan prepare for tests.

“It is helpful to really understaridlyour test

it with someone that you trust or maybe journal

about it,” he said. “As you are explaining it orwrit— .

when you know what you are dealing with.”

lf,there’s smoke, you’re so
probably not in New York City

Although smokers may soon run out of
places to light up, nonsmokers may gain
places to breathe.

New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg
announced plans to ban smoking outdoors

_ in parks, beaches, marinas, boardwalks and

pedestrian plazas last week, according to
CNN.

In 2006, California’s Air Resources Board
released a report that resulted in second-
hand smoking being declared “a toxic air
contaminant,” reported Slate.

“The science is clear: Prolonged exposure
to secondhand smoke —— whether you’re
indoors or out — hurts your health. Today,
we’re doing something about it,” Bloomberg
said in a press release last Wednesday.

Los Angeles and Chicago already have
similar outdoor smoking bans in place, ac-
cording to The New York Times.

Should Pittsburgh be next?

While we would be supportive of this type
of smoking ban in Pittsburgh, we have to
wonder how effectively it can be enforced.

In an article in The New York Times,
Bloomberg said, “It may not be logistically
possible to enforce a ban across thousands
of acres, but there may be areas within

parks where restricting smoking can pro- A

tect health.”
Secondhand smoke contains thousands
of toxic chemicals, including benzene and

carbon monoxide, and is known to cause or
contribute to lung disease, cancer and heart

‘ disease, according to Mayo Clinic. Second-

hand smoke also leaves a toxic residue on
hair and clothing that is dangerous, espe-
cially to children, who are more vulnerable
to secondhand smoke.

To reduce secondhand smoke as well as
attempt to further curb smoking rates, New
York City’s proposed ban “would affect more

than 1,700 parks, playgrounds and re’cre— '
ational facilities, as well as the city’s seven

beaches, which span 14 miles of shoreline,”
according to The New York Times.

New York City Council speaker Chris-
tine C. Quinn said that ﬁnes for rule break-
ers “should be modest and not intended to
punish.”

But even if such a plan were to go in ef-
fect in Pittsburgh, we feel it would be too
unenforceable with punishments not harsh
enough to make much of a difference. And
with recent crime on and near campus, hav-
ing police constantly scanning Schenley Park
for smokers is probably not the best use
of resources. Still, it’d be nice if smokers
would keep it out of playgrounds, plazas
and parks. .

And while smoking is a lifestyle choice
people have the option of making, they
should remember that their decision can
linger in the air for hours. I

Letter to the editor

To the editor,

The Pitt News deserves praise for its efforts in
exposing the University of Pittsburgh’s danger-
ous zero-tolerance alcohol policy — a policy
that everyone except decision makers at Pitt rec-
ognize as a serious threat to student health.

As student anecdotes and interviews conﬁrm,
the University’s publicly-stated willingness
to cite students for underage drinking in the
emergency room ofUPMC Presbyterian deters
students from seeking medical attention while
underage and under the inﬂuence of alcohol.
While most students value their lives and the
lives of their friends too much to not seek or not
help someone seek medical attention even if it
means a citation, it is an obviouspdanger that just
one student, fearing a citation, will not make the
right decision and someone will die.

To be clear, in enforcing this policy, the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh is putting student lives

- at risk.

Based on our research atThe Publius Foundation
and on accounts published by The Pitt News,
we believe that the University should instruct
police officers not to issue underage 
citations on the grounds of‘UPMC Presbyterian.
Furthermore, in order to inform students of this
change and signal to students that it is possible
to seek medical attention without facing legal
penalties for consuming alcohol underage, we
believe that the University should publicly an-
nounce this new policy on its website and via
e-mail to all students. We arecurrently circulat-
ing a petition to this effect.

TUESDAYS WITH MOLLY

 

Politicians should make policy, not jokes

Molly Green
Columnist

 

Politicians can’t be ﬁmny. It’s kind of like Gol-
lum trying to be Smeagol — it’s too late. You
are a soulless, pandering machine now, about
25 percent human being and 75 percent hair
spray, whitening strips and various nondescript
Brooks Brothers power suits.

It’s likely that some politicians had a sense of
humorintheir past but lost it inthe treacherous
climb to power, a la Anakin Skywalker losing
his hand and becoming Darth Vader. Others I
seriously doubt ever quite had ahandle of what
makes a good wisecrack. A

Joe Biden — bless him — is a horrible co-
median, but he loves to tell j okes! Biden makes
what I like to call “grandpa jokes” — that is,
jokes that are meant to seem hip and “with it,”
but are just really, really awkward for everyone
involved. —

Last March, Bidenwas asked to give a“cornic
performance” at the 2010 Radio 8: Television
Correspondents’ Dinner, and while his jokes
were on point, there was this weird moms-who-
shop—at-Abercrombie quality to them, like when
he told Massachusetts Sen. Scott Brown he had
the difficult task of replacing “the sexiest man
in the Senate.” A little weird, a little awkward,
very grandpa—esque. And if I were Scott Brown, I

thinklwould have felt morethan alittle creeped
out. -
’ gto the fact that we know many politi-
cians lackasense of humor, there are also those
strange times when we aren’t exactly sure if a
politician is joking or just being inappropri-
ate and eccentric. This occurred, for example,
when “Real Time with Bill Maher” showed a
clip of Delaware senatorial candidate Christine
O’Donnell saying one ofher ﬁrst dates was with
a witch at a satanic altar.

According to MSNBC, “The context of what
led to the comment is not clear and O’Donnel1 is
laughing while she talks about witchcraft.”

Is this a joke, and if so, why does it lack a
punchline? Is O’Donnell in fact a witch? These
are the questions that keep me up at night.

That being said, there are, of course, politi-

cians who are witty, which brings me toimy.
second reason why_ politicians can’t be  
There is a large portion of the American popula- ,

tion that doesn’t have a sense of humor.

You know the type — Debbie Downers,
Stuffy Sallys, those people you never want to
play Apples to Apples with because they vote
“ice cream” as the most suitable noun for the
adjective “tasty.”Just for sirnplicity’s sake, let’s
call them literalists, because they take every-
thing paii 'nﬁilly literally. I

Literalness, of course, leads to political cor-
rectness. And political correctness is the No. 1

killer of humor. -

Just ask Barack Obama, who has taken ﬂak
for his jokes about the Special Olympics, Nancy
Reagan holding séances in the White House
and, of course, his malicious attacks on the
oitpersecutedtanning community, and its hap-
less victims, Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi and Rep.

John Boehner. I 1

I don’t, however, think Obama was joking
when he called Kanyewest “a jackass.”

Literalism is especially troublesome be-
cause, for whatever reason, politicians and
pundits love to make jokes about other politi-
cians and pundits dying, going missing, having
freak hiking accidents, developing dissociative
fugue, etc. etc; j _ I

anecdote that really touched me; It’s the story
of ole Otis “Bullman” Hensley.

Hensley, a former candidate for governor
of Kentucky, is maybe the best example of why
politicians should never try to be funny.

Itwas 2008, and the Bullman, amid aheated
primary race, decided to go to the store to buy
some ground beef. According to Fox News,
“While there, Hensley encountered a woman
with her two nieces, ages 11 and 13.”

“I offered to trade her a fattening hog for
those girls,” Hensley told Fox News. “I meant it
as a joke. I’ve said itamillion times. Mostpeople

get a kick out of it.”

I think I-'Iensley’s joke was funriy. Actually, she

ﬁled alawsuit against Hensley. Also amazingly,
Hensley did not win his bid for governor.

I think we can all take a away some very
important morals from this story: ﬁrst, that
jokes are easily misunderstood and thus should
be kept private or avoided altogether by those
seeking approval from the public; second, at
the very leastoffer two fattening hogs — one
is just kind of insulting.

Dark Star revives the Dead

Fans, rejoice: The Grateful Dead has been
reborn. '

.At least, that’s the goal of bands like
Dark Star Orchestra, whichremake and

pre—enact the original eclectic rock band’s

material every night. T

Having performed more than 1,600
shows since 1997, DSO makes a point of
recreating an entire Grateful Dead concert
as faithfully as it can. Although the lineup
changes, the band currently features seven
members, including keyboardist and vocal-
ist Rob Barraco, who was inﬂuenced by the
Dead’s sound at an early age. _.

“For me as a teenager, [The Grateful
Dead] was the pinnacleof music,” Bar-

raco said. “No other rock band played
with this level of sophistication and had
this songwriting talent and lyrical ability
to answer to every man. For me, that was

. important.”

Barraco, who said he was born with mu-

‘ sic in his “veins,” never wanted any other

career but music. He performed with other
tribute bands and even with Grateful Dead
bass player Phil Lesh earlier in his career.

The manager for DSO asked if Barraco
could step in when its then—keyboardist
passed away. _

“I did a tour, andil had so muchﬁin and
somuch respect for these guys because they
viewed the music the same as I,” Barraco
said. “I asked if I could do it again. It was off
and on for a few years, and I ﬁnally realized
this is really what I want to do.”

Barraco became a full—time DSO member
and soon mastered the Dead’s distinctive
style. ‘

“This music demands to be improvised,”
he said. “We don’t copy. It would be impos-
sible to do so. The Grateful Dead played
so many live shows it would take years to

recreate their work correctly.”

From the beginning, the cover band
grew fast. It played once a week, and its
crowd doubled every time. The Internet
only fueled the growth, allowing the band
to, in Barrac_o’s words, “share a. journey
with the audience.”

“We want to create the magic, too,”
he said. “Younger kids who never got the

' chance to see the Dead, they want this ex-

perience, too. We provide that for the kids
who would never have the opportunity.”

Other members of the original Grate-
ful Dead have played with DSO, including
Bob Weir, Bill Kreutzmann and Vince Wel-
nick.

“[Bob Weir and Phil Lesh] had so much
respect for us that they stole our guitar

’ player for their band,” Barraco said. Jeff

Mattsoncame in to replace the original
guitarist.  b

On the road, DSO enjoys a family dynam-
ic. Barraco loves spending_ time with his
band buddieslgand seeing fans and friends

Simkin:
Kabobs fun,
delicious

Sarah Simkin
Columnist

 

Colorful, fun and dangerous: If you didn’t
think you could apply these adjectivesto
dinner, you’ve obviously never had kabobs.

Add to them my two favorite qualities
of any recipe —— ease and deliciousness —
and these barbecue staples acquire a more
or less permanent position in my dinner
repertoire.

The amount of ingredients necessary to
make a kabob can be customized completely
to how many servings you’d like to have in
reserve. Invite a friend over or have some
leftovers for lunch the next day —— the choice
is yours.

is blissfully simple: First, assemble your ka-
bob components. I like to use onions, pineap-
ple, bite-sized chunks of chicken breast and
bell peppers. You can use a variety of colors

V for more aesthetic appeal, though personally,

I only like the red peppers —— they tend to be
sweeter. Virtually anything you can skewer
can be kabob-ed. Yes, that’s a verb.

Now comes the exciting part: stabbing
things with sticks. Wooden or bamboo skew-
ers are available inexpensively at most gro-

but beware of splinters. Some brands may
also advise that you soak them in water prior
to use to prevent the skewers from catching
on ﬁre —— which, needless to say, would be a
dinner disaster. Metal skewers are an eco-

beware: They get hot when heated.

When spearing my ingredients, I try to
go for a pattern or some semblance of logic,
like putting the onions next to the chicken
under the pretense that the ﬂavor will cook
in better that way. But it’s entirely up to you.

but try to avoid engaging unwilling passerby
as participants in a skewer duel. '

The kabobs could, at this juncture, pro-
ceed rightto the cooking phase, but they’d be
a tad bland. If you’ve got time, I’d recommend
marinatingthem». If I’m using pineapple as a
component, I like to usea teriyaki-pineapple

Check kabobs frequently

If you don’t know cooking time, use touch-and-go method

sauce to enhance the ﬂavor, but, once again,
you can use just about anything. See how fun
and interactive kabobs are?

Marinating times aren’t set in stone, but
in general, a longer amount of time is bet-
ter. On a college timeframe, if you’re able
to assemble them before you leave for class
in the morning, they’ll be perfect by din-
nertime, but it’s all right if you’re only able
to marinate them for an hour or two before
cooking.. Or you could forego the marination
completely and add a sauce of your choice
for extra ﬂavor.

I suppose if you’ve created anentirely
vegetarian kabob, you could eat it raw if you
so desired, but disregarding that possibility,
you’re going to have to get the salmonella

. out of that chicken -syornehow. ;, -

I If you’ve got-at George Foreman Grill or
some similar style apparatus, that’s ideal.
A real barbecue or tailgate-style coals in a
roasting pan will work too. I’d hazard a guess
that a panini or quesadilla maker would’
work ﬁne, but as I’ve never experimented

, with them, don’t hold me to it. If you try it
4 and manage to burn your kitchen down, I

will disavow all knowledge of this article,
whether my name is on it or not. Oven’bak-

ing or pan searing are other options you

could investigate, but once again, I cannot
attest to their viability.

Cooking methods aside, however, how
will you know when they’re done‘?

In a staggering display of incompetence,
I managed to forget to investigate the crucial
cooking-time detail when I ﬁrst attempted
kabobs. My father, whom I consider my
cooking guru when it comes to such things,
did not pick up his cell phone, work phone
or home line.

Telefact’s line was busy and thellnternet
in my apartment was down. There seemed
to be no hope.

I settled by checking on my roasting con-
coctions every few minutes, cutting into the
chicken to check if it was still pink. Hint:
While doing this, avoid cutting so far into
the chicken as to separate it from the kabob,
because then you’ve got a sad stray chicken
fragment on your hands and a bereft kabob

skewer. Somewhere between 12 to 15 min— '

utes later, I deemed them safe to eat.

Afterward, when I was ﬁnally able to
contact my father, he conﬁrmed that this
touch-and-go strategy was what he used
as well, giving me an overwhelming sense
of vindication. ,

he might have lost touch with if he didn’t

“The Deadheads are a cool eclectic
group of people,” he said, ‘employing the
popular phrase for Grateful Dead fans.
“Most are generous and big—hearted. I love
talking to them. They’re respectful.” ,

Even years later, DSO still retains its
freshness for fans. '

“One of the great things is the Dead had‘
the ability to reinvent themselves every few .

years and be modern with the times,” Bar-
raco said. “They never stagnated. Because

Habitat offers sanctuary for local food lovers

Lunch: 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.

Dinner: 5:30-10 p.m. Sunday hursday,

For college students who live, breathe and eat
local, salvation is only a bus ride away.

Habitat, the new Downtown restaurant
focused on using locally sourced ingredients
and exercising earth-friendly practices, opened
this past March on Market Street near the Cul-
tural District.

“We have a big farm-to-table philosophy,”
the restaurant’s general manager Jennifer
Churma said. “We try to use local, sustainable
items anywhere we can.” _

The ingredients for Habitat’s seasonally
rotating, multicultural menu are selected from
the local farms of Westem-Pennsylvania by
the executive chef, England native Andrew

items. We start off with the best,” Chef Mor-
rison said.
The chef brings a wealth of diverse experi-

ence to the table when selecting ingredients —

and preparing his ‘robust and vivid dishes.

T g “I started cooking in high school back in
‘England, working in restaurants a lot,” he
said.

He moved to the United States 20 years ago
and worked as a New York restaurant consul-
tant and cook forthe Four Seasons hotel chain

in Atlanta and Miami. And while Chef Mor-
rison has never received any formal training
as a cook, he has found the culinary arts to be
his true calling.

“All this time I have kept working and grow-
ing and have become very passionate about
whatl do,” he said. ..

However, Chef Morrison is only a part of
Habitat’s overall charm. The restaurant is
not only focused on “greening” its food selec-
tions but also its entire business. According to

Habitat’s website, all of Habitat’s furniture is
from within 100 miles of the restaurant and
purchased from local vendors. The menus are
made from recycled materials and local Forest
Stewardship Council-certiﬁed paper, and all
paper, plastic, aluminum and glass waste is
recycled. Even the cooking oil is recycled.
Habitat composts all inedible food waste
and donates leftovers to the Greater Pittsburgh
Community Food Bank. Such cognizant prac-
tices make the restaurant stand out in the arena

of civic engagement, but students unaware of
these acts of charity might ﬁrst and foremost
remember Habitat for its design.

“We’ve got a vast open kitchen, which fea-
tures our tandoor oven as well as our wok sta-
tion,” said Churma. “It gives our guests a chance
to see how their food is prepared and feel like
they are a part ofthe action.”

Also lending to a sense of community is the
“communal table,” anbbject “produced from
a single piece of wood and  completed with
a natural, earthy ﬁnish.”

Positioned at the front of Habitat’s exhibi-
tion—style kitchen, the table, considered the
restaurant’s centerpiece, seats 12 and is used
for “menu tastings, chef’s dinners and intimate
parties,” in addition to everyday dining.

Habitat is certainly a break from the norm,
but its warm earthy tones and wood accents
give it an atmosphere a little different from a
neighborhood eatery.

“It’s a pretty fun restaurant,” Chef Morrison
said. “We don’t really want to be looked at as a
ﬁne dining restaurant but rather a place with
good food — simply prepared and well pre-
sented  somewhere that is easily accessible
to anybody and everybody.” I

DSO keeps

Though not a performer, publicist Dave
Weissman came in to assist the band in 2002
and has been booked ever since.

“They’re a big tribute band, and as those
words represent, it’s mostly a tribute,” he
said. “But they’re a spirit band. They try to
step into what the Grateful Dead delivered
when they performed. They get to have a
fresh take on it every night.’-’

The Grateful Dead’s music changed so
much from era to era that if someone ever

grew bored of one style,’he could move on A

to another. _

“There’s a breadth and supply of music
so great I don’t think they’ll ever get sick
of it,” Weissman said.

“Many students were not of age when
the Grateful Dead were around and [front-
man] Garcia passed,” Weissman said. “This
is a great way to carry the torch and hear
what the Grateful Dead sounded like in their
heyday.”

Both Barraco and Weissman share an
excitement for their upcoming Pittsburgh
performance. Barraco cited the music hall
as a “cool place to play.”

“We already know we are going to play
a cool show,” Barraco said. “All I can say is,
it’ll be a mind blower.” I

FOOTBALL

Graham makes plays at running back

Ben Livingston
Staff Writer

115 rushing yards, two rushing touchdowns,
12.8 yards per carry and a dominant perfor-
mance en route to a big Pitt victory.

Common sense would suggest that this ar- A

ticle would go on to discuss the performance
of Heisman-candidate running back Dion
Lewis, not that of his backup, sophomore
Ray Graham. 5

‘ But after Graham posted the numbers
just listed in the Panthers’ 38-16 victory over
New Hampshire last week, it’s obvious that
Pitt has a lethal one-two punch at running
back.

Although Lewis has just 102 rushing yards '

and two rushing touchdowns on 35 carries
in Pitt’s two gamesjthis season, everyone
knows what he is capable of and can ‘break
a long run at anytime. ’ »

season, most notably his 53-yard run against

Notre Dame.

After sitting out the opener against Utah
with a knee injury, Graham carried a heavy
rushing load against the Wildcats. He had
six of the seven carries that the two backs
were given followingjon Baldwin’s 56-yard
touchdown reception in the third quarter.

Following the contest, he credited his
performance to the success of Pitt’s pass-
ing game. A

“They were biting so much on the run,”
Graham said. “When we started doing play
action, we hifthem with deep passes and_got
them off a little bit, so they had to play back a
little bit. That’s what opened up the run.”

Graham ran wild after Baldwin’spscore.

He rushed ﬁve times for 39 yards on the ﬁrst _
~ drive, plays which culminated in his ﬁrst

touchdown of the day. .

The interior of the offensive line is made
up of ﬁrst-year starters who are still making
adjustments and now, there is more pressure
on whomever is rushing the ball.

This makes ﬁnding holes important,
because there are often too many tackles
to break. According to running back coach
David Walker, Lewis’ game puts a heavier
reliance on Wrestling past defenders than

. Graham’s does.

“Their styles are slightly different,”
Walker said. “Ray is a little bit more nifty.

[Dion can run through some tackles a little

The Panthers suffered their ﬁrst two defeats
of the season at the Big East Partner Weekend
in Morgantown, W.Va., falling 2-0 to bothjames
Madison and Ca] State-Fullerton.
“We havetolook at everything,” Pitihead coach
Joe Luxbacher said. “We’re not goingto make any
major wholesale changes by any stretch —.- we’re
still 4-2 and we’re creating good chances —— but
we have to deﬁnitely ﬁnd some guys who can put

those guys.” 6

1'ONY’S TOP 10

10 must-see hoops games

Tonyjovenitti
Assistant Sports Editor

 

The men’s basketball schedule was re-
leased on Friday, and there are plenty
of exciting matchups. It looks like Pitt
will once again have one of the nation’s
toughest schedules, with games against
Tennessee, Maryland, Rhode Island and
maybe Texas in addition to its grueling
Big East schedule.

There are 33 regular—season games on
the slate, and although it would be great
to be able to watch all of them, I’m sure it
would be tough. So here are the 10 match-
ups that you can’t miss this season.

Nov. 8 vs. Rhode Island
1 0 —— National powerhouses
’ 0 like Pitt typically open the
season against a cupcake team like North
Carolina-Greensboro or San Jose State,
but this year Pitt is playing an Atlantic—10
power to kick off the season as part of the
Coaches vs. Cancer Classic. The _Rams con-
sistently compete for the A-1'0. title against
teams like Xavier and Temple. They have
eight NCAA Tournament appearances,
so this game could be a nice early test for
the Panthers.

Jan. 17 vs. Syracuse —— When

Pitt and Syracuse get together, it

0 always seems to be a memorable

one. Last year, Pitt went to the Carrier
Dome when the Orange were ranked at No.

5, and the unranked Panthers pulled off a

monumental upset to make it known that
it wasn’t going to be a rebuilding year. This
year, the tables could be turned, and Pitt
could be the’ favorite _at home. Add to the
fact that this game is on ESPN primetime,
and this is one every Pitt student should
not only watch but pack the Pete for.

Jan. 24 vs; Notre Dame — Luke
Harangody ﬁnally graduated. He
0 led the Irish for what seemed like

a decade,, and now Notre Dame will have
to come to Pittsburgh and try to hold off
the Panthers. Pitt will be looking for a bit
of revenge too. Not only did Notre Dame
beat Pitt in the regular season last year,
but it- also knocked the Panthers out of
the Big East tournament.

” Feb. 24 vs. West Virginia — The
last time Pitt and West Virginia
0 were on ESPN primetime, the
game Went to triple overtime, and Pitt
pulled out a win in perhaps the most ex-
citing game in the history of the Petersen
Events Center. And the time before that,
a lot of classless things happened in one
of the most disgraceful fan showings ever
seen at the WVU Coliseum. Needless to say,
thisgame should be a good one.

Dec. 1 vs. Duquesne —— The first

ever college basketball game‘ at

‘ O the new Consol Energy Center.
Need I say more‘?

Dec. 27 vs. Connecticut — This

is the second time in a row that 4

O the Huskies have visited the Pete
while studentswere on break. Last time,
however, Pitt still broke its own atten-
dance record with 12,908 people at the
12,500-capacity Petersen Events Center.
Hopefully, students will come back a little
early for this game, because Pitt vs. Con-
necticut has become one of the Big East’s
best rivalries.

Nov. 19 vs. TBA — Pitt will play

Texas or Illinois in either the

O championship or consolation

game in the Coaches vs.‘ Cancer Classic.

Illinois is always a Big Ten contender, and ~

Texas defeated Pitt last year in an early-
season tournament in the CBE Classic in
Kansas City, Mo., last year. This year, Pitt
looks to return the favor.

Dec. 11 vs. Tennessee — The
third ever college basketball
0 game at Consol Energy Center
will actually have a clear home team as
Tennessee travels to Pittsburgh to take
part in the DirecTV SEC/Big East Invita-
tional. Tennessee was an Elite Eight team
last year, and this could be a signature win
for Pitt if it wants a high seed in the NCAA
Tournament. In case you’re wondering, the
second—ever game at the new arena will
be Auburn vs. Rutgers for some reason,
because apparently having West Virginia
play in Pittsburgh would be too easy.

March 5 vs. Villanova —— Re-
member that Connecticut game
O where I mentioned there were
12,908 people in attendance?'Wel1, this
could wind up being the exact same sce-
nario as when the Huskies traveled to Pitt
for the ﬁnal regular-season game that fea-
tured two of the nation’s top five teams.
So don’t plan on heading home for spring
break early this year. It would be wise to
stay for this game.

Big East tournament game vs.

TBA — A few weeks ago, the Big

0 East coaches voted to keep the cur-

rent format of the tournament at Madi-

son Square Garden, which means the top

four teams will receive double—byes. Last

year, three of those teams lost in their first

game, including Pitt, which did the exact

same thing the year before. It looks like

Pitt will be in the top four again this year,

so this could be a huge game to see if Pitt

can claim back the power it used to hold
in Madison Square Garden.

Three years ago, Pitt was 6-0 in the Garden
when it beat Duke and St. John’s there dur-

. ing the season and then won four games

in four days to win the Big East Champi-
onship in 2008. Last year, however, Pitt
went 0-2 at the Garden. Pitt will have three
regular-season games there this year, and
hopefully they Panthers can make it their
“home away from home” court again.

So out of them best games, eight of them
are in Pittsburgh. The schedule looks
great —— here’s to hoping the team fol-
lows suit. I I

Walker said.

Meanwhile, Lewis and Graham stress that
they maintain a strong friendship. Graham
sees a little bit of a competitive atmosphere
between the two on the ﬁeld but points out
that this can be a good thing.

“On the ﬁeld, yes, [we’re] competitive, “
Graham said. “Off the ﬁeld, we’re like broth-
ers, best friends. We hang out all the time,
we watch ﬁlm together, we do everything
together. On the ﬁeld we do push each other,
because we have to. That’s our job.”

Lewis’ sentiments are similar, but he
might be beneﬁting from Graham’s success
more than anyone else. Lewis, who had a

nearly unthinkable sum of 47 carries against’

Cincinnati last season, might be able to take
a few more series off every game now that
Graham has proven himself to be a reliable
back. a

With this in mind, Lewis didn’t shy away
from admitting that it’s nice to catch his
breath from the sidelines occasionally while
watching his friend take on opposing de-
fenses_. “I need a break sometimes,” Lewis
said. I

“[Against Cal State Fullerton] I thought we
dominated the game,” Luxbacher said. “But you
have to score goals, and we did no ”

Pitt’s struggles over the weekend came in they
absence of two starters. Senior center Connor
Malone did not travel to Morgantown because
of an illness. V

Terry Akpua, who has nine shots on goal in
ﬁve games, did not play Sunday. .

Olutorni Ibikunle, who came off the bench to
score the golden goal in double overtime against
St. Bonaventure, hurt himself before Sunday’s

V game and also could not play.

“We were missing some guys, but that’s no
excuse,” Luxbacher said. “Guys who go in have
tostep up.” I N;

The BigEastPartnerWeekend marked theﬁrs
time Pitttraveled outside of Allegheny Countyfor

tion that travel caused his team to play poorly.

“[We have to travel], but so does everybody
else,” Luxbacher said. “Guys have to be ready to

play.”

Panthers win 3 ou

Torie Wytiaz
Staff Writer

Home-court advantage is not myth. The Pittwom-
en’s volleyball team learned that when it posted a
3-1 record in its own invitational tournament this
pastweekend .

 2, “Playingon ourhome courtreallymakes adif-
ference,’ ’ head coach Toby Rens said. “Itfeels more

comfortab1ethanplayingonanopponent’s court, _

or even at a neuual site.”
The Panthers (4-10) had struggled intheir early
season tournaments, but their success at the Pitt

Invitational couldbe asign of growingconﬁdence
and experience. . -

“The match victories allow all of the players,
especially the less experienced members of the

team, to gain a sense of conﬁdence in their play '

that will hopeﬁilly continue,” Rens said.

The Panthers dropped their ﬁrst match of the
tournament to No. 9 Washington but ﬁnished the
weekend with three consecutive victories over
Robert Morris, Bowling Green and Saint Francis
(Pa-)-

Washington 3,Pitt0 v
Despite the homecourt comfort level, the

Panthers were not able to match the play of the .

undefeated Huskies, as Pitt fell in three sets with
scores of 25-19, 25-11 and 25-12. In the ﬁrst set, the
Panthers managed to keep the score close, and
accordingto Rens, play at a high level.

“During the ﬁrst set, there was some great
volleyball,” Rens said “Each point was earned
with hard work, and there were intense rallies
throughout.”

5 Still, the Panthers lost the hitting battle, as
the Huskies collected 42 kills to Pitt’s 23. Blocking
was also adecidingfactor, as Washington’s Bianca
Rowland recorded morekills individuallytl1anthe
entire Pitt team. Another battle that the Panthers
lost came in the form of experience.

‘After the match, I spoke to theteam and re-
minded them that Washington returned many
of their starters from last year and that they have
been playing together for a long time,” Rens said.
“A team like Washington helps us to discover our
weaknesses.”

Pitt 3, Robert Morris 0

The lessons learned againstwasbington carried
over into the next match against Robert Morris
where the Panthers earned setwins of 25-21, 27-25
and25-22. '

Seniors Amy Town and Imani Harper led the
way olfensivelyfor Pitt. Both recorded double-digit
ﬁgures inkills. Harper,whowas namedto theAll-
Tournament team, particularly impressed Rens
with her play.

“Harper had an outstanding weekend,” Rens
said. “She ﬁnished with an overall hitting percent-
age above .400, and her blocking added another
dimensionto ourteam play.” ‘

Harper’s 15.kills against Robert Morris made
for a season-high ﬁgure, and her weekend total of
blocks came to 19. Town, inadditionto her match-
leading 17 kills, contributed’ eight digs to the de-
fensive etforts. S ‘

Inperhaps the most excitingrnatch ofthe tour-

win against the Bowling Green Falcons.

Akeyelementinthevictotywas the entire team’s
defensive play, and the communication amongthe
six players on the court.

“Iwaspleasedwith ourback—row defensive play-
ers,” Rens said. ‘°I‘heywere instrumentalinenfore
ing team communication and chemistry, which is
animportant intangiblei_nvolleyball.’’ ‘

Senior Tara Rohall ﬁnished the match with 11
digs, and her classmate Melanie Feldman recorded
six. Sophomore MargyActon came up with 10 digs
againstthe Falcons. .

and a personal career best.

Leggs earned 33 kills and eight blocls in the
tournament, aswell as praise ﬁomthe head coach.
“Leggs has been working hard in practices to de-
velop as amiddle blocker,” Rens said. “Her playthis
weekendis evidence ofthatwork and its payoff: and
I have been impressed with our middle blocking
as a whole.”

Also of interest to Rens was his team’s ability
to respond to a third—set loss with a win to secure
the match victory. A

“The team has really developed as far as team

chemistry goes,” Rens said. “During timeouts, the ‘

players had helpful feedback to give their team-
mates, whichis evidence ofagrowingcomfortwith
each other.” ‘ ‘
