$137 Assessment
.Made for CR Damage

By DAVE GREEN

Nobody seems to have found out yet why Student Con-
gress was hit for $137 dollars in its account with the Bursar.
In presenting the ﬁnancial statement of SC to the mem-
bers Monday, Treasurer Dan Berger said he couldn’t ex-
plain an item entered as “Commons Room destruction and

PA. system.” Men’s Council

officials stated that they had

been assessed $55 dollars for “destruction.”
The legislators have assumed that the costs are in pay-

RECESS ANNOUNCED

The Christmas Recess will ex-
tend from Monday, Dec. 22, to
Saturday, Jan. 3. The Univer-
sity oﬁices will be closed from
Dec. 24 to Dec. 27 and the fol-
lowing week from Jan. 1 to

F rats Debate
Discrimination
In Charters

Twelve teams have entered in
the Interfraternity Counci1’s de-

bate tourney on the question Re-

solved: That All Social Fraterni-
ties Remove Exclusion Clauses
From Their Charters;

This is a record number of
1;eams,,to enter an IF debate, ac-
cording to the frat men. The teams
meet sixth and seventh hours
Monday, Wednesday and Friday
and debates were begun last Mon-
day when Kappa Nu debated Phi
Epsilon Pi, KN’s taking the affirm-
ative and Phi Eps the negative.

Speech director Robert New-
ma-n is judging the contests and
each team which has entered is
being coached by a varsity deba-
l'.€l‘.

Confusion resulting from. the
unusual hours at which the tour-
ney is being held has been clear-
ed. up considerably and things are
expected to run much smoother

' in the future.

Wednesday Delta Sigma Phi de-
bated Pi Lambda Phi and today
Sigma Alpha Mu meets Delta Sig-
ma Phi. Elimination debates begin

°ment for the breaking and “ap—

propriating” of Commons Room
furniture during the Notre Dame
and subsequent victory rallies, but
they have received no word as to
whether their theory is correct.
Warrant Needed

Dan Berger explained Monday
that theoretically, no money can
be drawn from the Student Con-
gress account without a warrant
signed by the treasurer. Berger
claimed that he signed no such
warrant.

Student Congress President Jack
Burwinkle reports that Dean of

Men Theodore Biddle has sent a~

letter to the Bursar asking an ex-
planation for the entry on the ac-
count. But a number of ques-
tions still seem to be remained
unanswered.

1. Who gave the Bursar author-
ity to charge the bill for Com-
mons Room destruction to SC and
Men’s Council?

2. If the “destruction” took place
at the rallies, why weren’t SC
and Council notified of that fact?

Why No Bills

3. Why weren’t bills sent to the
treasurers of both groups?

4. Why was SC billed more than
Council, and who said who would
be charged what in the ﬁrst place?

5. Perhaps the biggest question
of all, why wasn’t WSGA charged?

At the SC meeting‘ Monday,
both WSGA president Adele Mar-

‘ riccini and Dean of Women’s As-

sistant Josephine Gallagher said
that no such withdrawal had
been made on the Women’s ac-
count. '

Ten or ﬁfteen orphans will be
denied a happy Christmas because
the oﬁice of the dean of men is
unable to give a group from Men’s
Council a special allotment to
finance a Christmas buying trip
for the children.

At a recent gathering of legis-
lators from council, a motion was
made by Harvey Rabinowitz and
Mel Forst.to select a number of
orphans from a non—sectarian or-
phan’s home, hold a party for
them at a fraternity house, give
the childrenﬁve dollars, and “let
them run through the department
stores spending the money on any-

said. ‘ I
Backs Project

The MC group voted on the idea
and decided by unanimous deci-
sion to back the project. They
presented the idea to Mr. John
Hardman, assistant dean of men,
who turned it down on the basis
that it was not feasible since it
went against the grain of MC
policies for expenditures of money
for outside use. '

He said, “Men’s Council funds

I was surprised about the in-
vitation,” the vice chancellor said,
“but have been interested inthat
subject for some time.“

Actual details of the workings
of the commission are vague at
this time. In general it will study
the law picture and submit its
conclusion to the governor. The
commission is to start at an early
date.

“It is not the type of job that
will require much of my time

fessor Nutting added.

ican Bar Association.

it would not be a proper expe_n-
diture of funds."

Forst, who is MC treasurer, then
asked if the money needed “to
help make Christmas, brighter for
the orphans" could be taken"ifi‘o1n
the MC Book Store proﬁts. He
met opposition from the office of
the dean here also. Mr. Hardman
explained that although the money
in the book store fund is proﬁts
taken from the sale of used books
sold to MC by students it cannot
be used for a purpose such as the
orphan’s party because “it - is
money belonging to the students
and MC cannot spend it.”

Idea Unique

Rabinowitz and Forst, who
feel the idea is unique because
the children will be taken through
the stores chaperoned by an MC
representative, then asked Ross
Reese to present the idea to Stu-
dent Congress.

Although many of the congress-
men favored the project it had
to be vetoed for the same reason
it met defeat in coun-cil——no ap-
propriation of funds.

proached next with the plan.

Dean of Men Has New Assistant

Pitt has _a new assistant to
the dean of men this year.

 — He is B. Charles Elliott, who
‘ comes to the University via

St. Lawrence college in Ap-
pleton, Wisconsin.

, Like anyone changing over ,

to a large university from a small
college campus, the new assistant

dean found himself quite busy

duringthe ﬁrst few weeks at his

new job.

Though he doesn’t consider him-
self entirely oriented to the cam-
pus yet, Mr.»El1iott states he has

‘already developed several favor-

able. impressions of both the stu-
dent body and the school itself.

_ Amazed at Spirit

“I was amazed at the spirit and

‘ life I found in the students here,”

he claims. “They seem to have a
great sense of motivation and un-
derstanding of what they want

i from life.”

Elliott believes this is due large-
ly to the fact that Pitt is an urban
school. I ‘

“At a campus school,” he says,
“students have to depend solely
on school activities for recreation.
Here, they can attend school
dances, etc., but still have oppor-

other sourbes. -
More Independent

“This tends to make them more
independent. I think this is one
of the reasons behind the students
great sense of motivation I men-
tioned,’_’ he explains. ‘

Mr. Elliott carries a pressing
schedule. Among the many or-
ganizations he heads or advises are
Student Congress and Men’s De-
bate. He also keeps busy council-

Ving students needing advice on
‘ various matters.

- False Alarm

Mr. Elliott also has charge of
the undergraduate and graduate
men’s dormitories. Shortly after
school began this year he had a
novel experience while at the un-

notiﬁed, and we wound up with

‘ Started at Grove City '

“They demanded an explanation,
but I couldn’t get outside to
straighten things out because I
wasn’t even dressed,” he laughed.

Mr. Elliott startedhis post-high
school .work at Grove City

Bucknell University where he took
courses in sociology and ﬁne arts.
He then attended Allegheny col-
lege in Meadville where he con-
tinued work in the same ﬁelds, and
took his graduate work’ in the arts
. at Syracuse University.

Though he has only been at Pitt
a few months, the younggassistant
dean of men has made a ﬁne start
on his job.

Some of the best of us have

questioned occasionally the

the lame and the halt alike. __

Much as we hate to think of
it, the grisly possibility also con-
fronts us’ that Sen. McCarran,
though old, still has a spark of
ambitionleft, and that he is us-
ing his investigations as a pub-
licity stunt, as a lever to pry
votes lose from his constituents.

‘ The trouble is, if everyone used.

the ' same methods, ‘the’ senator
would not have much of a de-
mocracy to be senator .of, for
men have done the same  the
past, and the result has always
been a little less .democracy, a
little more tyranny; Democracy
is based on the_faith that, given
a fair _chance and suﬂicient
knowledge, people‘ can and will
‘arrive at just. and humane solu-
tions to society’s problems. Thus,
one of its sublime virtues is its
appeal to reason rather
emotion, its efforts to seek its
ends . through understanding
rather’ thanthrough coercion by
fear. . '
Sounds Unprofitoble. Senator
Therefore, Sen. McCarran’s
approach, by appealing to emo-
tion and bigotry,‘ and its denial
of reason and tolerance, is un-
dermining the very -society in
which he is, according to.the'sec-

ond thesis, trying to enhance .l’l1S '

own power. It doesn’t sem very
proﬁtable, ‘somehow.

~ There is, of course, the third_

alternative‘ explanation ‘that the
senator is ’genuinely concerned
about the ‘fate of this nation for

. its own and its people’s sake,'that
, heis fully cognizant of the true

worth of democracy in terms of
the individual and the group,‘
and fears that Communist inﬂu-
ences can undermine -and event-
ually detrsoy it. He may be’wor-

_freel..co1d shots were recently

given to the students and teach-
ers to immunize them for the en-

same in the past, have shown

and ‘much more efﬁciency.

The. faculty seems to be in,

southern college was quoted by
a reporter for the Daily Texan as
saying it was ‘amazing how many

Society Not Combustible

But for that reaction to take “

place there must be a combusti-
ble political mixture to act as a
powder —- an unstablecompound
which can be made to break un-
der relatively slight pressure;

Aparently that compound is _ab-- .

sent T from our society, and
enough stabilizing elements ex-
ist so that.even in the depths of
the last depression Communism
does not offer enough in its eco-
nomic aspects to draw American

‘ citizens to it in any.rev0lutio_nary ~
numbers. Our capitalistic econ-‘

omy has given us the highest

standard of ‘living in history, a 4 -

standard that is gettinghigher
with each succeeding decade. We

V are so comfortable as‘ a -nation '
that we are not likely to attempt

any rigorous experiment» in rad-
ical economics. We can-resist the
political approach of the Com-
munists, also. The spirit of in-
dividualism is far to strong for
us topermit our submission to
the anonymityof communal so-

v~ ciety.

There are forces at work with-
in our society which are "produc-
ing changesin it, and a line of
evolution is being worked out,
but it is not in the-direction of
Communism. And the forces of
Communism are not likely to
have any major effect onthat
evolution. All of which indicates
that Sen. McCarran would be
smart to forget about the internal
threat of Communism, and let it
die of its own ineptitude. ‘

however, a resolution demanding‘

"thatfrom now‘ on they present

Professor Robert Tyson of,
Hunter College has written an
article entitled “Ten Ways to Get

Trying.” Of the ten ways, the
following seem
amusing.

1. If you must sleep arrange

the books for size and color.

Coming to Pitt soon’ after the
end of the war, Sgt. Shab has been
a strong pillar in the ROTC which
is centralized on the fourth floor
of the Cathedral. In addition to
conducting classes, he also coaches
the riﬂe team and is an assistant
leader in the ROTC marching
band.

Sgt. Murray, the advisor for the
Pershing Riﬂes, honorary frater-
nity for reserve military training
students, is a relatively new man
at Pitt. Having ‘been here just a
little over a year, he is an instruc-
tor for ﬁrst and second year stu-

Students Using
\Wro1tg Door

Many students have been using
the .wrong Field House entrance
to see the basketball games and as
a result arecausing a congestion
at the main entrance, according to
Mr. John Hardman, assistant to
the dean of men.

Mr. Hardman asks that all'stu-
dents use the northeast entrance,
the one closest to the stadium.

He also asked students to be
sure to have their ID and activi-
ties card with them for the games
and at the same time he cautioned

1 them against giving their card to

anyone else to gain admittance to
the‘ games. He said that twelve
cards were lifted'from people at
basketball
game for that reason. .

Sergeant James Murray thinks Pitt bigorous

in three: the Marines, the Navy,
and now the Army. W'hile in the
Marine Corp, he instructed many
non-coms, including movie actors
Tyrone Power, William Holden,
and -Glenn Ford. - ’

He relates, “My prize student
was Tyrone Power, with a mark
of 98.7, the highest grade recorded
in the Marine O. C. S.

Though reluctant to admit it,
Sgt. Shab saw action in Sicilyand
Italy. Before returning home, he
was ‘decorated with the Silver
Star, resulting from his display of
heroism at Casarene Pass. “We
were attacked by. the Germans,"
he recalls. “I stayed back in the
rear guard echelon ’till all the‘ rest

"had pulled out, then a machine gu

bullet hit my leg.” Although Shab
makes little of his actions, the
army ‘thought him worthy enough
to be awarded one of the nation

. highest decorations. i

Local Talent
Both of these young men are 10-
cal products. Shab is from Oak-
land while Mu1'ray’s home is in
Bellevue. Together they have
twenty years of active duty. But

their. careers in the military have‘

not prevented them from devoting
sime time to rather interesting
hobbys.

Shab has chosen ‘shooting and‘

baseball is his favorite leisure time
while Murray has a
great interest in photography and
collecting ﬁrearms. To date Mur-
ray has invested over $4,000 in
cameras and ‘dark room supplies.

Sgt. Murray also, through his in- .V

terest in ﬁrearms, is regardec‘ by
most of his friends as a real au-
thority on the subject.

revise their style of basketball.

‘No more can they use the am-

lurks behind a high ridge to spring
upon unsuspecting dribblers, wrest
the ball away, and speed back
down the hill with it. ‘ _

For now the game must, be
played on the level, thanks to re-
pair jobs now under way at the
Stadium pavilion.

Ever since the IM leagues in-
herited the pavilion from the var-
sity, the ﬂoor has been buckling
and warping, in spite of two re-
pair jobs. Athletic officials are
taking another crack at the job,
hoping to iron out the situation
for good. j

In the meantime, games are be-

order that IM schedules need not

they have tucked away their ﬁrst

Adam Matscherz, 28-year-old sophomore

Adam, who never wrestled before com--

then he slipped a wedding band on his girl’s ﬁnger.

For Pitt

Western Reserve, 105-87, when
Walls set a school record with 44
points, and earlier victories were
registered against Findlay, 0., 97-
51 and Kent State, 76-73.

True, these schools are not hard-
wood giants, and the Redskins
have not _been sensational in their
marksmanship—hitting on 39.9 per
cent of their ﬁeld goal attempts—-
but such high scoring is bound to
mean trouble for Pitt.

Tomorrow night’s 8:15 fray
marks the ﬁrst cage meeting with

Pitt’s frosh wrestlers relied on
Heavyweight Ed Stowe’s pin of
Kiski Dick Herron to capture a
19-15 victory over the Prepsters
Wednesday at the Field House.

Stowe’s win climaxed an uphill
ﬁght by Coach Dick Brenneman’s
grapplers, who captured all the
heavier division matches to win
the affair.

Ed _DeWitt scored the only other
frosh pin when he beat Dan
Brown in the 167--pound class.
Other Pitt wins were scored by
Ron Kurtz (130), Gene Barone

(177), all‘by decision.

College football will goon the television sets next fall
as expected and despite objections from Notre Dame Ath-
letic Director ‘Moose Krause it will be limited to one Game
of the Week. ‘ .

Krause and the Irish have long opposed any restrictions
on live television of -football and have challenged the legality
of the NCAA rule prohibiting live grid television for two

years.

No one can blame Mr.
:Krause for his opposition since
the popular gridders from the
Midwest have received _as
much as $300,000 a year for live
television of its home games.-

But Bob Hall, NCAA TV
head, and his committee, have
decided to extend limitations on
grid games via teevee for at least

ﬁnal quarter to down ‘the 
Chemical Frosh, 36-31,‘ after,
a hot nip and tuck ﬁrst threei
periods in the Cathedral gym Wed— ’
nesday night. .

The Civil A’s of the Engineering
League started off with a 9-4 ﬁrst
quarter lead. Chemical Frosh then
fought back and as the half ended, 
they trailed the Civil’s by only one
point, 16-15.

In the third frame both teams
racked up ten markers each, boost-
ing the score to a tight 26-25. Then
in the ﬁnal period the Civil A’s
put the game on ice. They chalked
ten more points while the Frosh
scored six.

For the A’s, Russ Schwetz starred
on both offense and defense. He
topped the Civil A scorers with

  

one more year.

Krause claims that the smaller schools beneﬁt on the popularity
of the Irish and the other top drawers at the gate and denounces
the plan that receipts of the, teeveed games be, divided among the

member schools. -

He suggests, for "the sake of a legitimate argument, that
since these smaller schools beneﬁt from the name “Notre Dame”
that these schools should divide the ﬁnancial aid they receive
from state, endowments, and alums with the Irish. To him,

this is fair.

Captain Tom Hamilton, many months ago, had even a more
streamlined plan. He favored a “pay as you go” system for video"

owners.

television company,” he said.
tainment.”

At the time Hamilton was the spokesman for the TV committee
and racked his brain at many meetings trying to come up with a
solution that -would almost satisfy all concerned.

_ “Football receipts ﬁnance the entire sports program for
many universities and, must be kept up.” Hamilton was referring
to the present plan of televising games as a controlled program.
It was also a. way to ﬁll empty seats or be paid for them. .

Hamilton’s plan would certainly solve the problem but one can

never tell. Bell, for example, just raised the price of a phone call
to ten cents. So what would stop Dumont from upping his price

50 per cent to a half buck?
