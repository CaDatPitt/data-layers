Disorganization in   l l J  
Brings About Student Complaints

By GLENN FREUND

Pitt News Staff Writer

A student in last fall’s I22 Actingl

I class‘ has filed a grievance for what

he calls “the arbitrary and capricious

grading system by his instruc‘tor,
Steve _Wyman. ’

, Howard Stern, a political science

major, charges that Wyman violated

six of the twelve faculty guidelines of

the University Model Code ‘and _

accuses thedepartment of “negli-
gence concerning the manner and
method. in which Acting I was
conducted.”

According to’ Stern andvothers h
involved in the class, Wyman was V

released ‘by the department to

-pursueajob offer in New Yorkand —_
returned in the last month ofithe

class to administer the grade.
Wyman, wh_o now-lives in New
‘York where he directs the TV show,
“The‘ Doctbrs,”*was_ contacted by
The Pitt News but was‘. out of town

, and not available for c'omr_nent.

Attili_o Favorini,Chairman of the

Theatre Arts Division, admitted
V that “students in the past expressed .

qualms about Wyman’s work” and
had hoped that Wyman’s trip to

' New York.“would s-peed and facili- ‘

tate his departure from the faculty.”
Wyman taught at Pitt fora year and
a half after coming from the Univer-
sity of Texas, according to Favofini.

Of the 15 or 20 students who were
in Wyman’s ‘class, nine were con?
tacted ' about, the ‘ class. _All were

  Caribbean Region:

Health Building with W. ‘Robert

“Warne said the region was
“acutely vulnerable" for a variety of
reasons, including chronic economic
problems, inability of the countries

to defend themselvesiproperly, and

the withdrawal of] metropolitan

powers, such as Great Britain,. lead-
‘ing the countries to seek new

relationships. '

As a result of this vulnerability,
Warne said,‘the Reagan administra-

and ELAINE JONES

I think that the hour has come to
take 0ne's rights, not. to ask “for
them; to seize them, not to begfor
them.

—-Fidel Castro (1955)

Dick ‘Gregory, a long time civil

rights activist, social critic and
author, came to the Bradford cam-
pus of the University of Pittsburgh
on Thursday, February I9. The
audience consisted of students, pro-
fessorsiand a variety ofthe Bradford
area residents.

Gregory’s lecture centered around
his overriding concern and/ or belief
that the small percentage of people
who possess most of the wealth in
our nation also control and decide
the course of our society. The prim-
ary capitalist concern for profit has
been ‘filtered down through society
(by the use of the media, politicians
and some religious leaders) and the
subsequent condition is one in which
many of us have succumbed to the
force ofgreed in our pursuit of mate-
rialistic goals and pleasures. _As
Marx himself said, when speaking
about bourgeois society, “The ruling
ideas of each age have been the ideas
of its ruling class.”

Gregory was firmly convinced,

that the present mode of existence,
in which corporate and multi-
national interests clash with the
urgent changes necessary to abolish
poverty and institutionalized racism
and sexism, must be transformed

into a more humane, cooperative -

society. He believed that we, as a
people, must rearrange our priori-
ties in such a way that we will see the
absurdity in permitting the bour-
geois, upper class leaders to control
our thoughts and the C.I.A./F.B.l.
military triumvirate to control our
foreign and domestic actions. His
moral and/or spiritual outlook
became evident when he called upon
us to internalize absolute standards

- of morality which will enable us to

thoroughly transform the world in a
way that reflects our inner beliefs.
Following the lecture, Gregory
gave a short interview with Elaine
Jones and Mark Lawson, both stu-
dents at the Bradford campus.

M. Lawson: Mr. Gregory,il would

like to ask you about something you

mentioned in your article for Play-
boy (December 1980) about your
visit to Iran. You spoke about the
need for a spiritual revolution in this
‘country. Do you envision this as a
realistic possibility in a capitalist
socio-economic system, where as
long as a market can be found for a
product or commodity, people’s
needs (housing, education, mass
transit...etc.) and safety are secon-
.dary to the all encompassing laws of

Disorganized Class

been more clearly communicated by’
Dr. Wyman in the first place it
would not have been troubling to the
students. He said it is customary to
have a specialist fill in and teach a
performance class and the situation
normally doesn’t trouble the class.
“In fact,” said Favorini, -“this is
the first time/in I2 years I’ve been
here there’s been a complaint of this
kind. I think that’s a testimony to the

quality of instructors we have here.” '
Said one student in the class, “The -

objectives weren't well-defined and
weren’t communicated clearly by
Wyman. Because of that it was diffi-
cult to grow or have direction.”

, “It‘was, frustrating,“ said Dawn"

profit‘? This seems to contradict spir-
itual values. '

Gregory: Well, first of all, you can
separate the person away from the
‘machine. Anything that people have
control of is possible. Whether or
not it is probable, I don't know.
There have been people down
through the history of this country
who have been spiritual. Spiritual
power supercedes capitalism and
trickery.

M.L..: Although you are firmly in
favor of a revolution, I am person-
ally in favor of another kind of
revolution—a socialist revolution.
Would you be against this type of
revolution?

' want to. The problem is, and Zim-

babwe is a good example, that once
you program people to fight you
can’t unprogram them not to fight.
I’ll tell you, if you wanted to start a
:revolution, the same manipulators
will give you the guns to do it: lfyou

Only two of the students inter-.
viewed expres'sed_ dissatisfaction
with their grades,‘ but six of them
hadgotten “nothing” or “not much”
out of the class as a whole. They did
not blame the teachers for‘this,ebut
some said they thought the class
should have been replaicedfbiy a sin-
gle substitution. -

. Three of the studentsiiiterviewed
said they were not particularly

bothered. by having different .

teachers and by a lack of continuity.

ferent perspectives,” ‘ "said one

M.L.: Why then'did they go‘to great
extent tokill off the Panthers in the
country?

D.G.: Because the Panthers came
up with a breakfast program. Before
the Panthers came up with that they
didn't have any problems. For I8
months the Panthers said to kill the
white, racist policemen and not one
of them died. But when they came up
with their breakfast program, their
problems started. The Soledad
Brothers tried to pull people's coat
to Eldridge Cleaver. Anytime a
black man goes to jail for raping a
68-year-old black woman they said
let him be rehabilitated, but don't
take him in no leadership position.
Eldridge Cleaver ain’t never been
anything but a trick from day one.
But it never worked in my neighbor-

hood. What worked in my neighbor-
hood was whenthey came through

~ with a breakfast program that was

wiped out within- twelve months.
They- moved -past the guns and
started getting a program together
that, among other ‘things, dealt with
one. of the big-killers, in the poor-.
neighborhoods which is lead poison-"
ing.‘ The ‘Panthers would come
through the neighborhoods and col-

lect the urine of babies and check it,

out for lead poisoning. All these
things that they were doing, which
had nothing to do withviolence,
were the reasons the police and
manipulators felt~that they had to‘

“We were upset,” said one student
in the class, ”because there was no
continuity to the basic form of the
class. We didn’t learn very much to
be taught different‘ concepts.
Towards the end we had n’t grown to
the point we would have if Dr.
Wyman had taught thewhole class.-"
Elvgren said that the situation
that evolved "after Wyman‘s depar-4
ture was “a series of unfortunate

M.L.: You spoke earlier about peo-
ple being conditioned into choosing
between the Democratic and
Republican parties, Carter and
Kennedy or Reagan end Anderson.
There seems to be a conscious lack
of identification or solidification
between-the more “‘popular" black
leaders (Andrew Young, Jesse Jack-
son, Shirley Chisholm) and the more
radical black leaders such as Clifton
DeBerry (who was the Socialist
Workers Party presidential candi-
date), Angela Davis and Manning
Marable (_a member ofthe Executive
Committee of the National Black
Political Assembly). What are your
impressions on the failure of“popu-
lar" black leaders to communicate
radical ideas to the people?

ment, irideed in every job, you find
yourself in a circumstance-a person

showed up. You just roll up your
sleeves and say ‘Let’s do it again.”

“The Theatre’ Division of the uni-
versity is in a" sustained growth phase
and one _ol. the growing pains is
something. that happens like this.-
that is, that an instructor is allowed
to proceed along without the.abso-

Pitt Recognizes Honors

By JULIA ACKERMAN

Pin News Slofl Wriler
Colleges . and universities have

failed to bring a “sense of unity and -

purpose to the American people,"
Dr. Norman S. Graebanersaid at
Pitt’s fifth annual Honors Convoca-
tion held Wednesday at Carnegie
Music Hall.

The convocation publicly recog-
nized the academic and leadership
achievements of university students
and faculty in the past year. Over
800 outstanding scholars and lead-
ers were honored. .

Guest speaker Graebnerdelivered
his convocation address, titled
“Leadership, Scholarship, and Con-
temporary Society," after receiving
an honorary Doctor of Humane
Letters degree from Pitt. Graebner,
professor of American mod-ern his-
tory at the University of Virginia,
has authored numerous books on
American foreign -policy: and
history.

_“The educaiional effort has done
little for American politics, and if
education cannot include the politi-
cal process, it is not clear that it can
advance the performance of society
at all," Graebner said in his address.

“American education tends to de-
emphasize human experience,"
according to Graebner. He pointed
out that there is much to be learned
from ancient and modern political
thought.

“If the formal education of the
founding fathers was limited, their
writings comprised a remarkable
body of thought. We might have
exposed all of our leaders, political
and economic, to such thoughts and
to such human standards,”
Graebner said‘.

Graebner then compared the
acceleration of the United State's
educational system with that of the
political structure. _

“The level of political campaign-
ing, and with it the declineiof voter
turnout, has gone down steadily‘.
The cost and size ofthe nation’s edu-
cational structure has skyrocketed.

"Clearly there is something wrong.”

“We in educational life face the
need to impart more forcefully gen-

eral concepts of normality, honesty, '

and clear thinking into the blood
stream of American education,“
Graebner said, i
“There is much important work to
beidone in strengthening the aca-

demic profession «and in making it—
- useful to society," Graebner added,

“enabling it to create’a more benefi-
relationship
between scholarship and
leadership.” .

Graebner concluded that, “The
universities can uplift the quality of
the country’s function and engender
a growing concern for society’s
future. It is ‘certain that neither
government nor business will do so.”

Greek  otes

  By DAN‘ SAlNT

Being involved in the Greek sys-‘
tenTat Pitt is ‘a unique ‘and enioyable
experience.«The debilitating animos-
ity between Greeks that occurs at
most other colleges is virtually
absent at Pitt. Within our system is
, an‘ uncommon amount of team-
work, which allows tts to accomplish

a great deal for-not only the Pitt and -

Oakland communities butalso for
th‘e Greater Pittsburgh area.HPitt
Greeks are involved in large scale
efforts requiring extremely tight-
knit cooperation from the whole sys-
tem and, in-** many instances,"
‘small-‘scale _efforts undertaken by
individual houses. ’ ‘

v/’

For example, the 24-hour dance

marathon, heldylast weekend,’raised‘ -

over $9,000,'which will be returned A
to the;P‘.itt Medical School as a grant
from the Heart Fund. Almost every

sorority and fraternity was repres-__

ented at this’ charitable event.

Unfor‘tunately,‘there have been

 

»     - L*etters   

z‘

many other.‘ individual charity.
efforts which have gone, unnoticed.
The Brothers of Delta Tau Delta
collected over $5,000 in their annual

walkathon, which acquired a.tre-..

mendous ‘amount of effort. The

t Brothers at Delta Phi hold a weekly,

event--in which they stand in,traffic
on Saturday morning, collecting
_over $300. _ ‘

This year, the o__verall Greek goal
is to raise $50,000. That means that
each fraternity and sorority member
is responsible for raising $30’ for
charity, not including moneyraised
for the dance marathon.

Another example ofoutstanding
Greek cooperation and service is the
‘success of our annual blood ‘drive.
Pitt Greeks are the largest source of
blood for the Central Blood Bank of '
Pittsburgh. ' -

“Blood needs are ‘expanding geo-

metrically, directly proportio‘nal to‘ ’

the advances in medical-techniques
such as the recently successful _liver
transplant-, which required an esti-
mated 80_pints of blood. The Central ‘
Blood Bank is: the only source‘ of
blood for 33 hospitals inthe Allegh-
eny and’Washington counties aswelly

_ as par.t_s of West Virginia. With the

. -yr

majority of fraternities and sorori-A

ties attaining l00 percent participa-

'tion of their members, the Pitt

Greeks are literally keeping our
community alive. ‘ ‘
‘The close cooperation among the
many fraternities and sororities is
delicately balance ‘with very intense,
healthy competition. This competi-
tion can involve a combination of
fraternities and sororities battling
against aru)thereombinatipn_in such
events“ as Fun and Games Night or
the chariot race. ‘ F «

. ~ A‘,‘ Q ' " P
However, there isalso fierce com-
petition between individual houses
in life and death events such as

Greek Sing or ‘intramural sports. t

The term life and death is ‘not an
exaggeration. ‘Who could forget the
final football playoffgame that went

‘down to th_e'.last play of the game

when Fij‘r bounced -a 47-yard field
goalattempt off the upright and lost
to Delta Phi, l7,-'14? ‘ ‘ ‘ -

Or who. could forget last year’s‘
Greek Sing competition, in which
the fierce cornetition ended in a first-

‘ place tie between Delta‘Phi and Fiji?

So, the nexttime y\ou hear somei- ,

body equate the Greeks with mass

‘sexual orgies,‘ wild beer parties and .

hazing, youlll know“they’re referring
to the Greeks at West .Virginia. ‘

. Picking And,Putting The Lice In Their Place

\'*.'— V

J Dear Editor:

_The recent outbreak of terror on
the Pitt campus has resembled that
ofa nuclear fall-out. And the lice are
upset about it. “lt’s unwarranted,”
said a spokesman for the lice, “what
we’re doing here is about as danger-
ous as Uncle Wesley’s C.l.A.
connections.”

Another louse, who asked not to
be identified, explained, “All we

, want to do is suck some human

«R

“blood. We’re willing to dig in if
necessary.”

lt has been reported that the lice
are preparedito dispell allegations
that they only inhabit dirty, "poor
people. The 4| cases in Holland Hall
and ‘the positive diagnosis ofat least
two Resident Assistants from‘Tower
B seem to indicate that the lice may
not be playing favorites as rumored.

These small, grayish-white, wing-
less bugs, about the size of tiny ants
areitired of such anti-lice verbal
slashes such as, “That's not rice.
.that’s lice” or “Slice some lice” and
“Its delightful to be deliced.” An
informed source revealed that a

&,group of nits (a louse‘s eggs) have

been hanging pro-lice banners from
the dorm hall windows. One propa-
‘gandnistic slogan read) “Lice is nice.
Thanks Holland, University, of
Pittsbug.”
Other slogans were: “You don’t
have spiceuntil you get the itch for
lice.” and “Check alouse for coeds.“

A confrontationseems to be ensu— '

ing. From pa-st clashes with lice the
medics know that there exists three
divisions of lice: head, body, and the

 

most ruthless ofthem all -—--crab lice.
The headiree usually attack the hairs

‘ on the head. The body lice sneak

between seams and linings of clo-
thing only becoming visible when
they move to the body to feed. The
reputation’ of the tormenting crab
lice is widely known: they prefer the
groin and peri-anal regions. All
three types can live up to 48 hours
offa body. Their divisions are con-
stantly reinforced by nits, who can
live up to five days, before they must
attack. The lice cannot jump ' as
rumored; they might be devious but
they are “lousy" athletes.

The students seem to be using this '

knowledge of the enemy gainfully.
‘Hats, brushes andd combs have
been put in boiling waterto flush’out

1 any snipers. By Marshall Law the

students have been ordered to main-
tain a distance of two feet in public
and to keep personal contact with
infested clothing and bedding to a
minimum.» Sexual Contact and the

use of toilet seats have been banned. i_

Large shipments of Kwell shampoo”
and other chemical weapons have
been sent to the front lines. Mercen-
aries have been hired to exterminate

‘enemy-occupied territories. All of

this has had a detramental effect to
the morale of these tenacious, little

7 creatures.‘

But a grea't battle was'wAon by the

lice on March 5th. Although the-\

information has been ‘coming in-
fragmented, it seems a high-ranking
doctor at the Student Health-Service,

4 asked; Eleanor Streiff, the disease

control chief of Allegheny County
for assistance in combating the out-
break. But the control chief had to

deny the request on the basis of mil-

 

K,

itary strategy: just as winter aided ~
- the Afganistan rebels against the

Russian invaders, it appears the
warm weather has been aiding the
lice.

I “This is the time ofyear when they
seem to pop out,” said the disease

control chief.

So. strategists for the .students

Opposition 

provision of the Schweiker bill is
unjustified. That provision merely
recognizes the obvious—that indus-

_tries with poor safety records are less ‘

safe for. workers than thosewith
good safety records. Consideringthe
ability (and tendency) of OSHA to
harass industry with regulations, it
seerris logical that the harassment
should be of those industries which
are unsafe and not of those .,which
make an effort to provide safe work-

i ing conditions.

The quote from United Auto
Worker Bill Kane isabsurd. Death is
the ultimate type of injury and ifany
industry is so dangerous so as to
cause 100,000 deaths, it is hardly
arguable that OSHA would :be
unable to inspect and regulate that’
industry. - ‘

, Fourth, I find itto be very discon-

certing that you _speak_out'agai.nst

'’‘‘big business interests” while at the —

-same time discussing with great

. favor the environmental and labor

interests. Interest groups byTdefini-
tion fight for. their o'wn‘“interests”

have recruited military advisors to
check large masses of students for
possible fraternizing with the
enemy. "

As of now the conflict seems to be
at a virtual stand-still. Deployment

' of forces has subsided on both sides.

However, experiences from around

’the_world have proved that once

expansion oflice infestation starts, it

.-/

and (‘these “interests” are rarely in the
public interest.‘ Your
assumes that labor and environmen-

tal interests more clearly represent

the interests of the American people
than do the business interests. Con-

‘ sidering the results ofthe recent elec-
_ tion" and _
positions of these subjects were well‘
this A

that the president’s
known before the ’ election
assumption is rea'lly.unj ustified. The
only interest group that represents
all the people is the Congress and it

, will have to decide these issues.

.Finally., -to argue that environ-
mental and worker safe-ty issuesare
‘.‘moral" issues is to show a complete

‘lack of understanding as to the dif-

ferenceibetween moral and political
issues. These issues are now and

Dwayne Wal|ace's ability to guide th
Pitt’s fate tonight against ldaho-

By JOHNETTE HOWARD

The post season continues to
breed surprises as the Pitt Panthers
basketball team gets set to meet the
ldaho Vandals tonight in the first
round of the NCAA Far West
Regionals in El Paso, Texas.

It all started_last weekend when
the Panthers, 'written out of the
Eastern Eight’s elite at midseason,
rebounded to wrench the league

championship away from Rhode”
island and Duquesne. Pitt assistant

coach Seth Greenberg,» acutely
aware of Pitt’s underdog role at the
tournament, summed up Pitt’s
unexpected rise to the crown upon
finding that no one had the foresight
to anticipate Pitt’s vicotry.
“We won it, but where’s all the
bubbly?” Greenberg said.
Then came the surprise announce-
ment"\last Sunday, as members of
Pitt athletic department were check-
ing the ﬂight times to the Eastern
Regionals in Providence and Char-
.lotte. The NCAA computer, which
determines the tournament pairings,
had banished Pitt to -El Paso, Texas
and the Far West Regionals against
somebody called the ldaho Vandals,
reigning champs of the illustrious
Big Sky conference.
Yesterday, even the oddsmakers
got into the act and installed the

Panters as 3'/2-point favorites to‘

send the Vandals stealing ‘-back to
ldaho and obscurity. I

“We’re the Rodney Dangerfields
‘of collegiate basketball,”said ldaho
coach Don Monson of his Vandal
team (25-3), which suffers more

‘often from a lack of respectthan

losses, thanks to a schedule the cyn-
__ics label as weak. -

unexpected honeymoon with fate in
a darkhorse role at the NCAA tour-
nament, sometimes referred to as the
“March. Madness” because of the
unexpected events that crop up
yearly. Pitt is seeded 45th out of the
48 teams in the tournament, and sev- .
enth in their Regional, three notches
below ldaho. ,

The big key in tonight‘s game is
expected to be in the backcourt,
where Pitt’s swift guard tandem of‘
Carlton Neverson and Dwayne Wal-
lace will be outto intimidate ldaho’s
guar/ds,' K~en Owens and Brian
Kellerman.‘

Owens, l_daho’s playinaking point

assists this season and enters the
game as the team’s second-leading
scorer with a 13.5 average. It will be
important for Pitt to shut down
Owens, the spark of the ldaho
offense, to prevent the Vandals from
working their ' patterned.‘ attack,
which shoots a sharp,55.l 3‘ percent

' from the floor.

Panther coach Roy Chipman said
it will be important for Pitt to estab-
lish a fast tempo early in the game to
combat -ldaho’s slowdown style of
play. _. '

“They like to keep the game scores
in the 60 gauge and to prevent teams’
from running on thern,” said Chip-

— see the score up in the 70s or more. It

should be a battle in the first few

Chipman is again counting he_av- ~

ily on ‘Pitt’s swarming 1-3-l defense
to carry the -Panthers on to the
second round of the tournament

against North Carolina (25-7),’

which received a bye in the first
round. W '

“Our team is/playing excellent
defense right now and defense seems
to take over in a tournament like
this,” said Chipman; “I think it’s an

advantage going into these playoffs’

A to crack the Vandals zone. Pitt needs
to get the ball inside against ldaho,
‘which occasionally also switches

iBut Chipman did not seem too

“An offense can suffer because of
emotion or nervousness, but we’ve

Pitt Divers Look To
Qualify for Nationals  

*"7‘By SEAN BARNES

Pm News Sports Writer

Pitt‘s men’s and women's diving
coach, Julian Krug will be a busy
man the next three weeks, for the
end of the swimming season is also
the end of the diving season with
Nationals right around the corner.

The Pantherette divers have had
prequalifications
representing the teams in the East
will be Pitt’s Julie DeHaven on both
one— and three-meter boards.

'J\‘«‘.DeHaven was the only diver in the

I with Pitt's Greenwell and Minik tak- 

East to qualify for Nationals. The
Pitt men have their diving prequali-
fication meet today and tomorrow
at Cornell University in Ithaca, N.Y.

All three of Pitt’s men divers—- Pat
Greenwell, Mike Minik and Bob
Lambert—will be diving, all hoping
to be among the four individuals
chosen to go to Austin, Tex. for the
NCAA championships. Pitt has two
strong hopes, Greenwell and Minik,
on both the one— and three-meter
boards. Both were ranked in the top
three places on both boards at
Easterns.

Greenwell and Minik have had
outstanding seasons as Easterns
showed. Minik’s superb perfor-
mance got him on the one-meter
board and a new Eastern Confer-
ence .record with his score. Joe
Greenwell, Pat’s brother from Penn
State, took second while Pat took
third. Pitt's Greenwell is last year’s
Eastern champ, but brother Joe and
Minik, both sophomores, upset him
this year.

Penn State’s Craig Brown won the
Eastern three-meter competition

ing second and third respectively.
Krug was satisfied with his divers’
performances and expects Minik

already, and-.

and Greenwell to qualify for Nation-
als in both diving events. Krug said
that Minik’s one-meter and'Green-
well’s three-meter diving has a
chance to place them within the top
28 in the United,States.

Judging at Nationals will be dif-
ferent, according to Krug. Since div-
ing judging is based on a person's
viewpoint and not the clock, there
will be professional judges, includ-
ing some of the nation’s best diving
coaches.

At dual meets and Easterns,judg-
ing was done by coaches ofthe teams
participating in the meets, and even
the best coaches’ judging can get a
little biased whenjudging the oppos-
ing teams. Pitt was not just one of
the other teams at Easterns, but also
the one that was winning the meet.
So Nationals will show a somewhat
less biased scoring, according to
Krug. A

After National prequalifications
today and tomorrow, Krug will
travel with the women swimmers
and divers to South Carolina next
Thursday, Friday and Saturday.
Krug will attend the men’s swim-

a ming and diving Nationals the wee-

kend of March 26-28.

This season is Krug’s second at
Pitt, and he already-wants some-
thing Pitt has not had——a national
qualifier in diving. Krug sets high
goals for his divers, as he did for
himself in his impressive diving
career.

He graduated from the University
of Wisconsin, where he was a three-
tirne All American. He then coached
the U.S. Naval Academy for three
years before moving on to coach
Southern Illinois for three years.
Krug was a U.S. Olympic trial quali-
fier in 1968, 1972 and 1976. Under
Krug’s coaching, Pitt divers have
excelled to a national level.

Rutgers, ECVL’s Loom Ahead
For Pitt Men’s Volleyball Team

By AN NA ARLOTTA

Pm News Sports Writer

The Pitt men's volleyball squad
faces a tough weekend as it travels to
New Jersey to meet top-place Div-
ision I Rutgers-Newark on Friday
evening, followed by the Eastern
Collegiate Volleyball League
(ECVL) tournament on Saturday.

Rutgers = barely defeated the
Panthers earlier in the year in the
teams’ first meeting of the 1981 sea-
son. To date, the loss to Rutgers is
the only one that the Panthers have
suffered A

That contest, played one month
ago, went the full five games before
Rutgers dominated Pitt and ‘took
match victory three games to two. A
win over Rutgers would put the
Panthers in a tie for first place in
Division I.

The Panthers are newcomers to
Division I in the ECVL this season.
Pitt’s performance in last year's

ECVL tournament was possibly the -

one that gave the Eastern onlookers
the chance to see that Pitt was a top
team in the region.

Pitt has been picked as the favor-
ite to win this year’s ECVL tourna-
ment, which will field 12 teams in
two pools of six.

“Both Rutgers and Penn State,
the leaders in Division I through half
of the 1981 season, will not be com-
peting in the ECVL on Saturday,”
said head coach Ray Reilly. “Penn
State will be playing at the Ball State
Classic and Rutgers is taking the
weekend off." i

The annual tournament sports all
Division I teams (those that choose
to compete) and any Division II
schools that are interested in becom-
ing Division I squads for the follow-
ing season. ‘

“We placed third in the ECVL
open last year,” said Reilly, “and
that’s where I think that Eastern
Volleyball eyes beagn opening up to
the type of ball team that we are
working with.”

The Panthers and. Reilly recently
have been working on their weak
spot in their play—outside hitting.

“The outside hitting is starting to
cause us problems,” said Reilly.
Teams have been scouting us
throughout this first half of the sea-
son, and they have realized where
our weakness lies. This put more
pressure on ourmiddle players and
causes us to lose some of our offen-
sive punch.” S

“We all have to work on this prob-
lem,” agreed team member Scott

served.

Robbins, “except for Brian
(Devine), Bill (Knuth) and Dave
(Baird). Everyone else has to start
coming around. We have been
working on this in our drills all
week, and I think we will be able to
see an improvement this weekend.”

' However, the team still has conﬁ-
dence that it can overcome Rutgers
in its bid to take top honors in Div-
ision I.

“When we played Rutgers earlier
this season,” said freshman starter
Gary Groshner, “we gave them a
really good match, and I think we
have a shot at beating them the
second time around. Sometimes it
seems that no one wants to play out
there, but we play really well when
we want to. I think that this should
be a successful weekend."

Rutgers coach Mario Tarbich
seemed to overlook the play of the
Panthers when he scheduled Pitt to
be his team’s second match of the
evening. Rutgers will open up in a
best of ﬁve against another confer-
ence foe, George Mason. _

“The fact that we will be the
second team that Rutgers will come
against that night will work for us,’-’
said Reilly. “I think that we were a
bit overlooked."

“I think that their coach thought
that they were going to walk allover
us when he scheduled us to be their
second match of the night,” said
Robbins. ‘-‘We lost to them, but that
was a month ago. I think that this

_t_irne we co1gd_ pull the upset."

The Panther indoor soccer team’s

fine performance at the Youngstown
State Invitational Tournament last

weekend earned the Pitt boaters the

first place trophy in their initial com-
petition of the season.‘

The Panthers showed that they
have been doing their homework
since their return to competition in
January. They have successfully
pulled together their efforts to sport
a 3-0-3 record and capture the tour-
nament championship.

The Panthers, a fairly even team

.where experience is concerned,

proved_ that the combination of

youth and veterans could pull toge- .

ther and work effectively. The
Panthers have a good concept of the
indoor game which differs a good
deal from the outdoor contest.

The same basic skills are required
but the indoor style of play requires
a number of plays that would resem-

 

such as the give and go, fast breaks,
and man-to-man defensive play can
be seen 'when watching indoor
soccer.

Pitt opened the day up with a
game against Case Western Reserve
of Ohio. A goal by Al Adelmann put
Pitt quickly on the boards. Adel-

mann's goal was followed with'a.-

goal by freshman Nick Wilson. Wil-
son took a pass from teammate
Gerry Wasson and ‘placed the shot
past the goalkeeper’s hands. How-
ever, CWR equaled the score at 2-2
and the contest was finalized in a tie.

“I think that we came out for that
first game rather flat,” said Panther
goalkeeper Scott Thunberg. “We
had to get adjusted to the size of the
floor which was very wide. After_ the
team did that, the momentum
picked up and we never let go ofit all
day long.”

Pitt's momentum picked up quite
considerably when they faced their

This time the Panthers were on the

goal of the contest after he took a

selves in a 2-2 tie once again, this
time against Malone College of

ing from Adelmann. With a win and
two ties the "Panthers accumulated
enough points to continue into-the
championship round-robin against

competition,” said Wasson. “Now
we finally are getting it all moving
and we’re working well with each
other." _ '

The Panthers also showeda fine
defensive display, with more defend-
ers attacking and shooting.

V Scott Thunberg also figured suc-
cessfully into the Panthers move
into the playoffs. Thunberg
recorded six saves on each of the
first three matchups. ‘

Going into the playoffs, the
Panthers repeated their earlier con-
frontation with CWR with the out-
come being a 2-0 Pitt victory.
Wasson combined with Tiedtke to
score the initial goal and number’
two was headed in by Adelmann.

Another 2-0 win was Pitt’s over
Kent State, this timewith goals com-
ing from the Norton brothers, Troy
and Scott. The first was from Troy
with the assist going to Tiedtke.
Scott’s was a strong shot to the left

‘side.

The final game of the day sported
Pitt against rival Mt. Union, with

the Panthers needing to at least tie

the game and hold Mt- Union to no

more than four tallies. That feat was

accomplished successfully. ‘
Adelmann scored. the first of the

‘ game with andassist to Troy Norton,

  Soccer Team Wins Bid to Grove City   Tourney

Once again, Troy Norton had his;

foot in on the play and was accre-fa‘.

dited with the assist. Mt. Union was
able to -see two goals of their own
and tie the score with only two min-
utes left in the tournament. Tie was
enough for Pitt to be victorius.
“lt’was an all-out hustling effort
throughout the day," said fullback
Jim Hackworth. “What we lack a
little of in skills from last year’s
team, we certainly make up for in
hustling and determination. wé“
played a good defensive game‘

“One of our biggest assets on the
court isthat hustling," agreed Was-
son. “Once we keep on hustling, we
mark up well and we never let our
competition get started on us. None
of the other teams get a good chance
to get their momentum up like we
do. This will make us successful in
future tournaments."

i The Panthers next» tournament
will come tomorrow when they
travel to Grove City for a l2-team
two-pool contest. Pitt will play in
the early league with their first game
beginning at 8:20 in the morning.
Despite the optimistic attitude that
has carried over throughout the

"week, the Panthers will still face_.the

   

Grove Cit test with caution.
