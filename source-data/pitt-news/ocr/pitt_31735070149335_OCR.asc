Relay
Life raises
thousands

By Aaron Stier- Cohen
Staff Writer

When she was in the third grade,
doctors’ diagnosed Alina Crisi’s
father with blood cancer. V

Doctors told him and his family
that he would live for two years; he
lived for another ﬁve. On Friday,
Crisi, a Pitt sophomore, spoke to
her fellow students about what it is
like to lose someone to cancer.

“He was a ﬁghter,” Crisi said.
“Today I’m here at relay to keep
ﬁghting a-battle he couldn’t win.”

Crisi joined the more than 900
registered participants who set up
tents and booths on the Cathedral
of Learning lawn Friday night for
Pitt’s Relay for Life. The annual
event was hosted by Pitt’s Colleges
Against Cancer.

Participants raised $15,000
in seven hours from 5 p.m. to
midnight, which, added to the
$83,000 raised before the event,
brought the organization’s total to
$98,000. All proceeds will go to
the American Cancer Society.

Freshman Jerry Lee and his

. team from the second ﬂoor of

Tower A set up a makeshift dunk
tank, one of many on—site fundrais-
ers. People could buy ﬁve water
balloons for $2 and throw them at a

team member in a folding chair.

Freshman Owen Drinkwater
was the ﬁrst on the Tower A team
to take water balloons to the face
to raise money for the American
Cancer Society.

“I’ll switch with him when it
starts getting a little colder ou ,”
Lee said as a well-placed water
balloon from one donor caught
Drinkwater in the upperchest.

While music from a D] booth
carried over the Cathedral lawn,

the Tower A team and 96 other _

groups conducted their fundrais-

ers and entertained themselves. .

Some groups sold baked goods,
T-shirts and drinks, while others
hosted small competitions, such as
charades and a balloon pop, with
the chance to ‘win small prizes. .

Hundreds ofstudents came out Sunday to_ Bigelow Bou

By Michael Ringling
Staff Writer

Bigelow Bash is supposed to be a
break from Pitt’s upcoming ﬁnals,
so when students ﬂocked to see
Cobra Starship, all they wanted to
do was dance. ’

In the middle of their set, the
band asked the crowd if they want-

ed a slow song or a fast song, and A

the audience members threw up
their arms in favor of speed.

Pitt Program Council’s three-
hour event brought hundreds of
people to the streets Sunday af-
ternoon. The crowd sang along,

‘danced and cheered as the band

performed, following openers

Samantha Bycura, Pitt Program H

Council’s special events director,
said the Bash is the last big party-
like event for students before the‘

onset of ﬁnals week. She said it V

also served as a way for students
to forget about the bomb threats
for a little While.

“After the past couple of

months, we needed the morale’

of the campus brought up,” ju-

- nior Bycura said. “[The] crowd

was awesome. The furthest thing
from their minds were the bomb
threats.” _

Other students echoed Bycura’s
response. ‘

Sophomore Samantha Jones,
a chemistry major, said the event

a was a chance to escape from not

only thoughts of bomb threats, but
also looming ﬁnals.

said. “It’s the last chance to have
fun before ﬁnals.”

Jones said she was studying
in’her_ apartment when a friend
showed upat her door and invited
her to the concert.

That friend was Brianna Lu-
theran, a sophomore public rela-
tions and communications major
at Pitt-Bradford who cited “Kiss
My Sass” as her favorite Cobra
Starship song.

This was Lutheran’s second
time seeing Cobra Starship, and
although she enjoyed the show, she‘
said she would have preferred it to
take place in the evening.

“It’s weird during the day. The
atmosphere is different,” Lutheran
said. “_It could be better at night.”

Unlike Lutheran, junior Ian
Smith didn’t know much of Cobra
Sta~rship’s music, but he decided»

. to come out to the show anyway.

A

After hearing the band, he said that
he will probably listen to more of
their music. i «

Smith, a chemical engineerin
major, said he expected more stu-
dents to show up, but thevband had
a good stage presence despite the
event taking place in the middle
of the day.

“I’d rather be at a club on a Fri-
day night, but this is cool,” Smith
said about hearing the bands. “You
can tell they work the crow .”

Vice Provost and Dean of Stu-

dents Kathy Humphrey stood at '

the side of the stage listening to
the music. She said that the event
showed that students are“‘carrying
on” in light of the recent string of
bombfthreats.

“Students look like they are
having a good time,” Humphrey

‘ said. “And that’s what’s important
to me.” I ‘

ek threats bring count to 92

The Pitt News Staff

The number of bomb threats for the semes-
ter reached 92 this weekend, but Pitt is tell-
ing students to carry on.

The University evacuated seven dormi-
tories — Litchﬁeld Towers and Panther,
Pennsylvania, Bruce and Lothrop halls —
Saturday morning after receiving threats.

An Emergency Notiﬁcation System alert
sent at 5:30 a.m. advised students to evacu-

ate the buildings, and the University allowed
students to re-enter about two hours later. .

The day before, Pitt received ﬁve bomb
threats early Friday morning at Sennott
Square, Benedum Hall, Mervis Hall, Alumni
Hall and Soldiers & Sailors Memorial Hall.

An ENS message alerted campus to the
threats just after 5 a.m., and the buildings
were cleared after 7 a.m.

Vice Provost and Dean of Students Kathy

Humphrey sent out an email to students
Friday afternoon praising Pitt’s spirit in the
face of the bomb threats and notifying them
of new information related to University
policy.

Humphrey said that if a ﬁnal exam is in-
terrupted by an ENS notiﬁcation, the faculty
member will provide instructions for stu-
dents on where to go and what to do. She
also said that the deadline to change the
grading option for classes from a letter grade
to satisfactory/no credit has been extended
to the end of this week, and students on
probation for academic reasons will not be
suspended this term. V

“The person(s) responsible for this are

trying to divide us and take away something .

very precious, something very important to
all of us, something that dwells deep within
all of us. That is our Pitt community and our
Pitt spirit,” Humphrey said in the email.
“Yet they have failed —- for we are carry-
ing on.” I

  

 

Studentsgpresent projects at
Sustainability Symposium

By Nate Kreichman
Staff Wri ter

Inaction is one of the greatest challenges for

the environmental movement, said Mark
Collins. ‘

“One of the things that separates environ-
mental work is it rarely draws spectators,
it draws people who want to get involved,”
said Collins, Pitt’s environmental studies

~prograr‘n coordinator. “The single biggest

force atthe University is inaction. If you ac-
tually harnessed all that energy, that changes
everything. So I would say that’s the biggest
issue, getting people off the couc .”

At Friday’s ﬁfth annual Student Sustain-
ability Symposium, student groups show-
cased environmental work being done
across the community. The agenda included

a keynote address from City Councilman Bill
Peduto, question-and-answer sessions with
school administrators and employers, stu-
dent presentations and a “Sustain-a—bowl,”
which highlighted student environmental
groups.

The event was originally scheduled to
be held at the William Pitt Union‘, but was
moved to the Student Center at Carnegie
Mellon University because of current safety
and security issues at Pitt.

Organizers said about 100 people at-
tended the event, which went from 9 a.m.
to 4 p.m. S

Collins said he was thrilled about the

turnout in the face of campus disruptions,-

and the level of commitment to green issues
at Pitt that it displayed.

“We were about, I kid you not,-20 min-
utes away from canceling this whole thing,”
Collins said. “You talk about people being
committed, it sums it up when you have to
do it like this. You have to show up, you have
to be involved, you have to be adaptable.
You must care.” *

The symposium presented an opportu-
nity to raise awareness, educate and engage
students regarding a variety of environmen-
tal issues and campaigns on campus and in
the community.

In between panels and presentations,
participants walked among the various
booths that student groups set up for the
“Sustain-a-bowl,” showcasing environmen-

« tal action across campus and beyond.

Juniorjustin Lozano, president of Pitt’s
Greenpeace chapter, said that the ultimate
goal of the Student Sustainability Sympo-

V sium is to show Pitt students’ efforts in tak-
ing action to protect the environment.

“There’s a very wide range” of messages

. big institution like Pitt.” 

that each group has. However, every group
is very supportive of each other’s efforts
in trying to protect the Earth and educate
others about how they can take action,”
Lozano said.

Ward Allebach, a professor in Pitt’s envi-
ronmental studies program, teaches a class
called Sustainability.

Both during presentations and the Sus-
tain-a—bowl, Allebach’s students presented
projects they worked on for class. These in-
cluded campaigns for recycling and planting
trees in Oakland as well as making Pitt ath-
letics more environmentally friendly. They
started with Pitt’s women’s soccer game that
night by promoting more sustainable prac-
tices, like recycling, at sporting events.

Allebach praisedlthe event and all the
students’ efforts.

“This is not an academic exercise, this is
people who are tangibly doing things at Pitt
in the community, and it’s really important
work,” Allebach said. “Big institutions don’t
just turn on a dime. It’s because of students
like this that change is able to happen at a

 

RELAY  

FROM PAGE I

A makeshift jail was constructed next to . S

the track where people could donate‘$5 to

' incarcerate their friends.

Inmates had to raise $5 from passing
walkers in order to gain their freedom and
designate a new prisoner. Throughout the
night, a rotating cast of characters, includ-
ing one student in a Spiderman suit, begged,
heckled and bartered with passing walkers
for enough cash to earn release.

An opening ceremony kicked off this

i year’s Relay For Life, where participants

gathered to hear the event’s executive board
speak about Pitt.

Pitt sophomore Merel Duursma spoke“
about her personal battle with cancer, and
what it’s like to be on the other end of Re-
1ay’s support system now that she is cancer-
free. i

“Cancer never rests, it just keeps push-
ing,” Duursma said. “That’s what we do

- here at Relay for I_.ife, “we keep on pushing

back.”
_ Survivors and caregivers took the ﬁrst
laps of the eventon the grass’s dirty pathway

while participants cheered them on.

Each team had one participant walking or
runningtlaps at all times, while other team
members were free _to walk around and par-
ticipate in other activities.

Relay for Life committee co.-chair Taylor
McKelvie, a graduate student at Pitt, said she
was impressed by the turnout.

“A lot of times teams have different sched-
ules for people to come and go,” McKelvie
said. “But I have seen a lot of people staying
for the whole time.” ‘ .

As the sun went down, participants gath-
ered for the Luminaria ceremony. Organizers
placed glowsticks in paper bags and marked
the relay path in remembrance of those who
died of cancer. .

After a silent lap, one portable stadium
light lit up the lawn for activities to con-
tinue. , g

The event, which usually runs overnight,
was shortened this year due to the recent
bomb threats. . ' .

Lee _was grateful for the easy atmo-
sphere that permeated the lawn in light of
the bomb threats received at Pitt over the
past months. ' I

“Everyone has been scared,” Lee said.

“It’s good to get out the week before ﬁnals
and not be cooped up in the dorms.” I

Threats can’t

The recent bomb threats have
demonstrated the depths to which

‘ some people sink in pursuit of ne-

farious and unclear ends. The en-
tire campus is in turmoil because
of the evil actions of

   

doing this. We all know that’s ex-
actly what he or she wants.

Since the perpetrator is ‘unable
to command anyone’s adoration,

condemnation. I don’t want to

has survived.

I’ve often wondered what the
last regular column I wrote for this

for the place that’s been my home
for four years. So now, I want to

we refuse to let

it’s easy to feel like our campus is

good money for it too, and we’ll
be damned if we aren’t going to
do what we came here to do: to
get that education so that we may
better ourselves in whatever way
we deem important.

We are Pitt, and we support
those who keep us safe. The police
and their dogs hustle up ﬂights of
stairs again and again, yet they do
it without complaint. And whether
it’s by leaving dog treats by our
dorm room doors, through ban-

ners or in person, we thank them.
We are also 20,000 pairs of eyes
and ears, something the perpe-
trator must have uncomfortably
realized before retreating behind
an electronic veil.

We are Pitt, and we don’t take
kindly to being woken up in the
middle of the night. But we go to

school in a city proud of its his-‘

tory of getting things done, not
just whining about them. That’s
why we’ve offered our homes and
apartments to those who’ve been
displaced by the threats to dor-
mitories. We are attempting to
coordinate those efforts online

through Facebook groups, and

we will prevail.

We are Pitt, and instead of let-
ting our community descend into
paranoia, distrust and fear, we’re
coming together in a spirit of coop-
eration, camaraderie and deﬁance.

We still laugh. We still socialize. ‘

We still congregate in public. And
yes, we still sometimes drink and
irritate the neighbors. We still re-
spect each other, and these threats
have only strengthened the sym-
pathy we feel for one another. We
have no vindictive urge to make the
entire campus‘ jump to our every

demand. In these trying times, it’s

‘ remarkable how normal most of

everyday life in Oaklandistill is.
This normalcy is probably hateful
to the perpetrator, and our refusal
to surrender in the face of attacks
must be puzzling and frustrating.
We torment him more than he tor-
ments us. He might disrupt our
lives, he might be able to make us
leave a building or look over our
shoulders, but he cannot take away
the most important things we have,
and he never will. _’

We are Pitt, and we stand to-
gether no matter what our differ-

ences are. I know that some of my

columns have been controversial
and incurred some lively and oc-

casionally rude comments. But I’

don’t think this will be one of them.
All of us, regardless of political
views or other arbitrary divisions,
are tired of these threats. And all
of us support and worry about our
school as never before.

We are Pitt, and we will live by
the words of Churchill: “Let us go
forward together with our united
strength.” V

We are Pitt. We are proud. And
we will endure. I '

ning back Isaac Bennett Saturday
afternoon made up for forgettable
performances from Pitt’s quarter-
backs as the football team’s spring
drills came to an end.

Bennett, who will be a sopho-

more this coming fall, had 124 .

yards on 23 carries during the
Pitt Blue-Gold Scrimmage at North
Hills High School’s Martorelli Sta-
dium, including an early'51—yard
sprint that took Pitt into the red
zone. _

“He had the chance to learn a
lot and grow [this spring],” Pitt
head coach Paul Chryst said Satur-
day after the game. “Each scrim-

Bntt shnes during

 

mage, at least the last three or four
times we’ve gone pretty hard, he’s
done some things that have been
good.”

Pitt did not keep score Satur-
day and rah different situations
for each drive, with the offense
starting anywhere from inside
its own ﬁve-yard line to the op-
ponent’s 20. .

Bennett was quick to credit the
offensive line as well as his fullback
— a blocker he did not have in the
spread offense of Todd Graham
last year.

“I wouldn’t say [I was] the star,”
Bennett said. “My line and my full-
back were blocking great. Every-
body was working together, so they
allowed that to happen.”

Chryst said that the running
back trio of Bennett, Ray Graham
and incoming freshman Rushel

e-Gold Scrimmage

Bobby Mizia I For The Pitt News
Running bacl’ Isaac Bennett (34) almost helped lead Pitt to a Big East cliiunpionsliip last season.

Shell has the potential to be special
in the fall, but that it’s just poten-
tial at this point as Graham recov-
ers from a knee injury and Shell has
yet to play a college snap.

“I think it’s got a chance to be
good,” Chryst said. “It starts with
the line, and I think the line made
some improvements this spring.
Ray’s working, need to get him
back healthy, and Rushel, obvi-
ously, we all know what he did in
high school, so there’s also a lot of
questions.”

E.J. Banks rushed for 69 yards
and a touchdown Saturday, and
Corey Davis had 42 yards. Bennett,
Banks and Davis all averaged more
than 5, yards per carry.

The offensive line, though,
struggled to avoid false starts and
poor snaps early in the game.

‘H-lROW!NG A KIRSCHBALL

Remembering four
years of Pitt sports

By Lauren Kirschman
Sports Editor

To say a lot has happened in Pitt
sports over the last four years
would be an understatement. .

During that time, the football
team had a coach resign, hired a
coach, ﬁred that coach within two
weeks, hired another coach, had
that coach leave for anotherjob
after one season and then hired
yet another coach.

That coach is still here, by the
way.

The men’s

blew a three—touchdown lead in a
45-44 loss to Cincinnati that cost
Pitt a Big East Championship and
a trip to a BCS game. A botched
hold on an extra point ended up
being the difference in a classic
game that, while painful for Pitt
fans to remember, is still one of
the best games ever to be played
at Heinz Field.

Then there was the shock dealt
by the men’s basketball team when
the Panthers fell to Butler in the

A third round of the NCAA Tour-

nament last season. The game’s
bizarre ending sent fans through

memory to the Elite Eight during
my freshman year. ‘

Young might have been the best
player in college basketball that
season. That team might have been
the best in the country. .

But Scottie Reynolds and Vil-
lanova ended the national title
hopes of Young and the Panthers
with a last-second layup that sent
the Wildcats to the Final Four. It’s
a shot that will stick in the minds
of Pitt fans forever —— and not in
a good way.

There have been a few of those
disappointing moments, haven’t
there?

- that season, all come to mind.

There was Pitt jumping out to a
19-0 lead against Syracuse in a bat-

Pete in 2011. The Orange fought
back with a 17-0 run of their own,
but it was the Panthers that came
out on top. The Oakland Zoo came
out in full force for that game, and

Turnley,.who started at center for the

vated him to become a leader on the offensive

“Ryan Turnley and Shayne Hale did a
really good job this spring,” Chryst said in a
press release. “If we are going to be the best
team we want to be this year, we are going
to need senior leadership.’’ A

He also added that winning the award
raises expectations for the two seniors next
season. .

“Certainly every time we give an award
like that, there are a lot of guys that deserve
it, but no one was more worthy than they
were,” Chryst said. “I think it also puts a

Hale said that the award was a testament
to the hard work he has put in since last

get that award meant a whole lot to me. I
deﬁnitely tried to come out and work on
something different every day and get bet-

SPRINB GAME

FROMPAGE7 A A A

“There are moments you have to clean
up,” Chryst said. “There are mistakes you
have to eliminate, but I think we’re working.
There are areas that we’re getting better —
not where we want to be by any means, but
it was a productive spring.”

Center Ryan Turnley said the penalties
aren’t something to overanalyze.

“It wasn’t guys jumping on the wrong
count,” Turnley said. “It was just a couple
guys getting antsy, that’s all.”

Turnley also said the line has progressed
well this spring in working as a ﬁve-man
unit.

“[We’ve improved at] protecting the
passer on a consistent basis, and not hav-
ing four guys do it and one guy come free,”
he said. “You have to have all ﬁve guys, and
I think that on a more consistent basis we
have ﬁve guys in unison.”

Tino Sunseri, who this spring separated
himself asthe starter from Trey Anderson,
Mark Myers and Anthony Gonzalez, ﬁnished
the spring game 13—for—27 for 147 yards with
one touchdown and one interception.

“Obviously there were some mistakes,”
Sunseri said Saturday.

Sunseri overthrew a wide—open Drew
Carswell twice in the scrimmage’s ﬁrst 20
minutes, but the quarterback said his strug-
gles Saturday were more a timing issue than

anything else.

    C0 1555 

      

“There’s still positives out of that,” he

said. “We were moving the football, guys are
getting open, we’re making the right reads
and we’re making the right adjustments. It’s
just ﬁnishing plays.”

Myers ﬁnished 10—for—16 for 167 yards
and a touchdown, which came when he
found wide receiver Brandon Iﬁll streak-
ing deep for a 58-yard score.

Anderson went 4-for-5 for 47 yards
through the air and also had a rushing touch-
down. Gonzalez did not see the ﬁeld until late
in the scrimmage but showed good mobility
in the pocket, rushing for 22 yards.

Several strong individual performances
from members of the Pitt defense also high-
lighted the spring game. '

Safety Andrew Taglianetti returned Sun-
seri’s interception 30 yards for a touchdown,
and he also broke up a well—placed Sunseri
pass to Devin Street on a crossing route late
in the scrimmage. ' -

Defensive linemen Aaron Donald and
Devin Cook -both had two sacks Saturday,
and defensive backjason Hendricks led Pitt
with 10 tackles. Defensive lineman Khaynin
Mosley-Smith had four tackles, one for a
loss, despite earning double teams during
red—zone drills in the scrimmage’s ﬁnal
hour. .

With the spring game over, Chryst said
his players will spend the summer watching
ﬁlm and hitting the weight room before fall
camp opens. “I wish we had 15 more [prac-
tices],” he said. “It’s a good start, but it’s
just a start.” I

There are very few players I enjoyed
watching more than Young. I also-think there
are very few athletes that played harder than
him. And I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention

against Connecticut in 2009. I can remem-
ber watching him ﬂip Hasheem Thabeet

moments and players as well, most nota-
bly at the running back position. Pitt fans
have watched LeSean McCoy, Dion Lewis
and now Ray Graham bust through Big East
defenses and leave their mark on Pitt ath-
letics. Each of those players was one of the
best offensive performers in the Big East
— and in the country — during their time
as Panthers. Defensively, fans have watched
jabaal Sheard, Greg Romeus and now Aaron
Donald consistently pressure opposing quar-
terbacks.

In 2008, Pittused four overtimes to de-

Pitt ran the same play three times before
completing the pass.

Conor Lee kicked the game—winning ﬁeld
goal, and McCoy ran for 169 yards and a
touchdown.

While the women’s basketball team has
struggled recently, the Panthers went to
their second consecutive Sweet 16 during
the 2008-2009 season, beating Gonzaga and
Montana before falling to Oklahoma. The
future looks bright for the team — which
didn’t win a Big East game this season —— as
the Panthers brought in a nationally ranked
recruiting class last year and will welcome
another solid group of newcomers next year,

' led by 6-foot—11 Marvadene “Bubbles” An-

derson.

And of course there’s the wrestling team,
which won three consecutive Eastern Wres-
tling League titles in my four years. The base-
ball, softball and both soccer teams got a
new home at the.Petersen Sports Complex.
The baseball team also set a school record
in 2011 when six Panthers were taken in the
Major League Baseball draft.

I don’t know where I’ll be next year, but I
know that Pitt fans will enjoy watching the
men’s basketball team’s top—15 incoming
recruiting class take the ﬂoor at the Petersen
Events Center. And maybe new head coach
Paul Chryst will propel the football team
back to the top of the Big East.

Whatever the case, I know I’ll be watch-
ing from somewhere. And I know that I’ll
miss it. E
