Ponther ’Eats '   the Owl A Yearbook
In Hopes ofSparking.Purchases  

By KAREN GRZYBICKI
Pitt News Staff Writer

A panther has succeeded an owl
in the hopes of rejuvenating student
awareness and interest in the school
yearbook. Panther’ Prints is the
new name of the seventy-three year-
old publication. It replaces The
Owl, the name for the yearbook
which had no apparent symbolic
meaning for the University of Pitts-
burgh, according to university ar-
chives. V ,

In 1907, the first year The Owl
came out, Pitt ' was known as
Western University of Pennsylvania
and had an enrollment of approx-

‘ imately 900 students with a faculty

of 140 and 2500 alumni. Where
The Owl got its name is unclear, but

wisdom.

“I’m -all for tradition, but this

was a tradition with no good foun-*

_dation.”Andy Smith, director of
student activities said. “I personally
feel that the new name is more ap-
propriate to represent the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh. ‘Panther Prints
has a dual purpose. It identifies the
panther as the mascot and ‘prints’

_as an appropriate pictorial

history.” .
Larry Lunsford, assistant direc-

tor of student activities, agrees.

‘ “The name change connotates

something ‘Pitt,’ ” he said.
“There’s not much loyalty from

Pitt students, Lunsford said. When-

you live at a school you get closer to
it.”

Burke with Rosenborough as a

Student government affirmed the
fact that Rice had inquired about
the availability of the elections
code. -

“Russell Rice may have been the

first candidate to inquire about ob- r

taining copies of the code. 'At the
‘time, they were not“ availabe. ’ In
fact, there were not copies of the
old code available until after that
date,” Rosenborough said;
“Basically what it involves is Rice

which is prohibited by the elections
code,” Burke said. .

“At the time I thought perhaps I
shouldn’t say anything, but later on
I felt that, maybe under the cir-

Pittsburghers got a rare oppor-

tunity to view the President of the

United States on Tuesday as Jimmy
Carter held one of his “town
meetings” at the Trinity Cathedral
on Sixth Street downtown.

_Although the meeting didn’t start

until 11 a.m., instructions to par-

alike - were clear: be there by 10
a.m. or don’t bother coming.

among the student body, Hopbell
said. ,

Lastryear only 1,000 yearbooks
were sold. The problem, Lunsford
believes, stems from the fact that
almost 80 percent of Pitt students
are commuters.

By changing the name,_Hopbell,
yearbook editor, said, “We hope
that we’ll increase peo'ple’s
awareness that we exist.”

According to VI-Iopbell, most peo-

,Student Government Board (SGB) hopefuls discussed the visita- .

campaigning begins for the upcoming election.
A field of eleven candidates are vying for eight vacant spots, and

“The student
Government Board must deal with
the one way flow of information
from the administration to the
students,” Cohen said.

“The visitation policy, the media
and publications board constitu-
tion, and the new fraternity rules
were all handed down by the ad-
ministration over the objections of
the students.‘ r

_“If the SGB works with all the
student organizations, then we’ll
have a strong voice to deliver to the
administration,” Cohen added.

‘Cohen said he agreed with the
idea of organizing a mass violation
of the visitation policy.

“It’s a good plan, it’ll cause a lit-
tle havoc with the administration,”
Cohen said. “It will force them into
a position of reevaluation their own
priorities and decide whether or not

it‘s worth having.”

The SGB should also reveiw the
recommendations of the allocations

according to Cohen. ’

“One reason is that there is a
large percentage of students who
are commuters, and most have no
interest in being here at night,”
DeLuca said. “We have to start to
get common goals, there has to be
some issues we go after as a
group.” '

“Another thing I’d like to see is
some type of student public rela-
tions group to let the students know
what’s going on,” DeLuca added.
“In an urban area like, Pitt, it’s
hard to let people know what’s go-

ing on with everyone spread apart.” ,

Junior Mark

he believed
students need to
become more
aware of student
government.

“I think no

Galzerano, a psychology major,

said. “A lot of people aren’t aware
that student government really can

that are funded by student govern-
ment that people aren’t aware of.”

 

 

that we would have to find some
other way,” he continued.

“I’d really like to see students get
involved, and if we could gain
power, form a grievance committee
that would be part of the student
organizations, where students could
come for help when bureaucratic
problems arise,” Crum said.

Galzerano suggested student
government “should take some
funds and show people what stu-
dent government is, what we can
do.” ' -

Galzerano added that he was
“really disgusted” with the visita-
tion policy. ‘

fact that it- isn’t working.

“I think the mainpthing people:

 ‘f Commuter facilities were also
«  discussed by Galzerano.

, . -“I’d like to see something for
 commuters in the student union,”
" Galzerano said. “They should have

a room and maybe a set of rooms so

Galzerano added that -he is a
member of the Inter-Fraternity
Council, the academic integrity
board, and has been actively involv-
ed in Greek Week.

“I really want

“We have to remeber we're deal-

largest V bureaucracv_. the largest

employer in Pittsburgh, and
sometimes I wonder whether educa-
tion is their first goal, or whether its
business,” DeLuca.added.

_According to DeLuca, the ad-
ministration is trying to control
students through moving frater-
.nities on campus.

“It needs to be done, we need to

- be moved on campus,” DeLuca
said. “But again, the university is
trying to -gain, control because they
will own the building.”

Gaskins said that leftover funds
from the student activities fee in-
crease should be allocated back to
student organizations.
' “I - feel that money should be
distributed equally to -those groups
who I feel have suffered the greatest
losses in financial cutbacks in the
-last two -or three years.” Gaskins
said. “The Black Action Society is a
prime example of that. They suf-
fered a massive drop in allocations.
A few other groups, such as
honorary groups, could stand some
financial funding.”

Gaskins added that he would like
to see a unified SGB. .

“I’d like to see a firm board,
working together,” he said. “I
know there’s been alot of bickering
on the board as to the policies-to go
after. In fact, as it stands right now,

the board is partly _liberal, a few-

members are conservative.
“I’d like to close that gap on the
board,” Gaskins said.

Peter Kaﬂovitch

The problems
Pitt commuters‘ ,
face are a con—-
cern of Peter
Karlovich, a
former Coma
muter — Affairs _
C o m in i t t e e_
Chairman.

Karlovich, a
junior computer ,
science major, saidpthat if elected,
he would work strongly with the
commuter affairs committee.

“Since commuters do make up 60
percent of the university, I think a
few more things should be geared
for. the commuters,” Karlovich
sai_d_. “I’d like to work with the Pitt
Program Council and see if we can
schedule some things with com-
muters in mind.” ‘

Karlovichadded that he believed.

"it was unfortunate that overnight A

facilities for commuters are not
available in the dormitories.

“I don’t see why something can’t
be worked out,’-’ Karlovich said.’
“It’s something that people keep

bringing up every year and the ad- .
, ministration keeps saying ‘no’ to.”

Concerning the visitation policy,
Karlovich said that he didn't agree‘
with the idea of "mass violations,
because “I don’t think it would ac-

’ complish anything.”

“If you could get 200-300
students to go to the next board of

, trustees meeting, and say we don’t

like the policy, and if we kept going

I, to every meeting, they'd have to do

something about it,” [Karlovich

“I think I have _
the capability to .
bring some .
desirable changes '._ V’ -
in the way stu- ’
dent government
is run,” junior
urban studies
major David
Kloss said. “I see 

-more student in-
volvement in administrative deci- . '

sions such as hiring more campus
police, whether to close such pro-

0

 

grams as the Women’s Center, and ,

also on faculty tenure decision.”

Kloss, a current member of the
Student Government Allocations
Committee, said he believes the
allocations process is satisfactory
and does not require additional in-
volvement from SGB members.

“I. deal with the handling of
funds allocated through student
government, which amounts to over
half a million dollars, which is pro-
bably one of the more important
functions of student government,”
Kloss said. “It gets pretty hectic,
but I don’t think you’ll find a com-

mittee member who will say they’re ' '

not up to doing it.”

  
  
  
 
  
  
  

In regard to the visitationpolicy,
Kloss said students have to_ work
with the administration to change
it;

“I think that with ‘close workings

can be reached,” Kloss said. “I
don’t feel that any restriction is

I justified.”

Kloss also commented on what he
perceives as a problem of student
apathy:

“Student’s really aren’t concem-
ed at all with the workings of stu-
dent government, and they should
be, once they realize what can be
done for them through student
government,” Kloss said.

“I think students are apathetic

ty well, being chairman of RSA and
working with the visitation policy,”
Slack said. “I was the liason be-
tween the students and administra-
tion in dealing with the visitation
policy.” " ’

 

Slack added that one of her main
objectives is to encourage student
involvement. -

“I want to get student govern-

ment to the students,” she said. “I
think somewhere along the line
there has been a separation between
student government and ’ the
students. ‘

“I think the job of student
government is to represent students
and I don’t think they’re doing it,”
Slack added. I think they aren’t go-
ing out to the students to see what is
happening. ’ ’ _

Slack also said the student
organizations ‘ needed to work
together.

"‘The university must see to it,
that they (scholarship funds) are
carried out in the purpose the
benefactor so designated.- That’s
our legal responsibility,” according

‘to Richard Tamburri, executive

assistant to the treasurer.

We have a number-of scholar-
ship funds left through similar be-
quests,” Tamburri said. “We have
one called the Millvale High School,
Memorial Scholarship. That par-
ticular endowment fund stipulates
that undergrads or graduates must

explained.

‘ “For whatever the purpose of the
aid is, someone will benefit from it.
Any money that the university
receives for scholarships is obvious-
ly a beneﬁt to the university and
more important, to the students,”
Tamburri said.

“Marked on the top of the copy

even longer still to release it. In

fans are left hanging on a limb,

lack of it, is such that when the
album is finally released,‘ it's
‘ gobbled up by the fans, ir-
regardless of whether or not it's
deserving of their loyalty. In
light of this, it's a pleasure to
report that Springsteen fanatics

have nothing to worry
about-—the Boss is back with a

winner.

The River is a joyous tribute
to early rock and roll, a frenetic
celebration of its past and a
broad wave to its future.
Springsteen and his band, may
be modern day musicians from
New. Jersey, but they've done
-their rock and roll homework.
They've taken a large portion of

Influences That Make
tBruce An Original ‘ i -

By Bruce Abrams

WARNING: "Because of the
nature of Swellfoot’s Tears the
language and the action of this
play are explicit and necessarily
obscene." So reads the sign‘
posted ‘next to the ticket window
of the new home of the Pitt-
sburgh Laboratory Theatre at
420 N. Craig Street.

This sign and this play mark
the first ‘time for years that I"
have seen a theater of ‘profes-
sional quality attempt a truly
avant-garde production. This
experimental type theater was
common in the late 60's and
70's, but by six or seven years
ago this and most live theater
seemed near its deathbed.
Broadway was downto seven
houses and the restof the coun-
try seemed the same or worse.

But now, just a few weeks
later, there are thirty-four shows.
on‘ Broadway. ‘Regional and
especially smaller theaters are

‘bursting out everywhere. As a

benefit to all of us, the fruits of

_this newly blossoming‘ alter-

native theater base havebegun \
tovemerge.

What does "alternative
theater” actually mean? The
Lab Theatre's Melanie __,Sm_i_th _

Lab Theatre have impressive
credentials, The current direc-
tor David Marchick has
previously directed for a theater
in Portland, Oregon, and two
theaters in San Francisco. In ad-
dition, his acting credits include
the National Bi-Centennial Tour
of People of '76.
The evening before opening
night I asked him how busy he
was. He said that he had had on-

' ly five hours sleep in the last two

or three days. I’ also found out
that he had recently built the
new offices in the front of the

theater, as wellflas working on ‘
. the construction for the current

set.

I was equally impressed by
Melanie ‘Smith. She has been
the assistant director of each
production for the -last» two
years, and assistant artistic
director for the entire theater.
She also functions in a third role

. as publicity director.‘ In this last

capacity alone, besides dealing

with programs, flyers, media .
releases to T.V. and radio, and .

forty local newspapers, 1 found
out that she recently spent a full
two hours planning where she

‘wanted each poster in Pitt-

believes it is, ”theater we feel

'needs to be done, but may not

draw a commercial audience.”
After a little more discussion I

V began to see it‘ as theater for the

enrichment of the community as
opposed to the enrichment of a
theater company, Understan- -
ding this much, and before"
reviewing this season's first
opening night,’ I wanted to
know more. Does this type of
theater make money? Is casting
open to the public‘? Does
everyone have -professional ex-
perience? Do the performers get

~ paid?

As a way of obtaining the
answers to these questions I
recently investigated the inner
workings of the Pittsburgh
Laboratory Theatre. It's creator

master's degree in expermental

After being almost the only‘

anyone can come_in and audi-
tion. Eut keep in mind that

many of the regulars l1'§ve'"ex-
cellent credits and backgrounds
in .both collegiate‘ and profes-
sional areas. Also, things like
what happened ‘last Sunday will

  

,l_t_0ep,en_ed October 23rd and will

run for four weeks. This is the
kind of controversial ' and ex-
plicit sexual production_that is
not for everyone.

The play is based on the
Oedipus legend and the setting is
ancient Thebes. It is a disjointed
repeating nightmare of a walled
city during a plague. ‘

You may be surprised to see
the actors on stage in character
and performing (if nonverbally)
as you enter the theater and find
your seat. This is but the first of
many innovative ideas to come.

The most impressive was a por- V

trayal of the sphinz through

imulti-colored ballons controff-~
ed by five or six of the cast‘

which at times broke apart and
spoke separately and at times
flowed together to speak and act
in the best ensemble tradition.

Among the other interesting

touches were a mixture of an '

ancient time frame with things

_ like a microphone, semi—modern

combat dress on soldiers, and
the onstage director in black
leather trench -coat, smoking.

. This director turns out to -be

]played by Leon Kat; himself,
who adds to the staging w'1rn'n1s
magnificent voice.‘

The overall play is best suited I‘

for students of the theater. by
this I mean theater classes, pro-
fessors, performers, technicians,
etcetera, who can work with the
script. I say this because it is
very difficult to foll_ow what is
happening in terms of scenes,
andsat ‘times, as well as in terms
of characters and lines. The
play’s general effect is depress-
ing and demeaning to the human
condition, and in my estimation
it is nearly impossible to unders-
tand why the author is making

The show is dazzling, fast--
paced, and innovative in its
techincal aspirations; a produc-
tion based on a seductive in-
timacy between stage and au-
dience. But unfortunately, this
intimacy abandoned the vast ex-
panse of the Heinz Hall

whimsical spectacle; a glittery

any lasting impression.

The production ‘was like a

formlessness, ‘but because of it
lack of any underlying unity of

This attributed, not to the

to this particular production.

Mrs. Anderson said that she was _

disappointed with news coverage of
her husband’s campaign “in some

“I am frankly disappointed that
even the press have been caught up
in this politicalgparalysis of the two
party system,” she said. “I think
the press owes the public the
responsibility of talking more about
the qualifications of each can-

horse race. They have, in my mind,
been politically paralyzed and some
of them have lost their creativity.”

  The Port
  Authority and
Kim Kormanik:

no Secret  

The Allegheny Port Authority" Transit Monday in-

__ itiated a reverse-ﬂow bus lane through Oakland aim-

ed at reducing the traffic congestion along. Forbes

-Ave. and decreasing the number of passengers A

waiting for buses at the busiest stops-I-Atwood Street
and Bigelow Boulevard.

. Though, its efforts were undoubtedly marked with
good intentions, there seems to have been one pro-
blem with the plans:

Why did PAT "keep the change such a well-kept
secret?

Monday morning Pitt’s commuting students were _

greeted with quite a surprise _as their 71A, 71B/U,
7lCand 7 ID buses travelled straight up Fifth Avenue
through Oakland instead of making the traditional
Forbes Avenue stops and turns. .

If the students commuting on the buses were con-
fused, we can only imagine the confusion and sur-
prise that must have prevailed in the minds of
pedestrians crossing Fifth Avenue, only to be greeted
by buses zooming down the street in what used .to be
the wrong direction. ’

One student, Kim Kormanik, 21-, of Oakland is in
good condition today at. Presbyterian Hospital after
being struck on the Fifth Avenue side of the Lit-

   an aim...  

' Page 8-Friday, October 31, 1980

Kormanik apparently dashed in front of the 71D
Hamilton without looking both directions and was

. struck.

Kormanik along with the other pedestrians pro-
bably failed to hear any announcement of the change
on the local radio or television stations or didn’t read
about the change in the newspapers. , .

More than likely they didn’t read about it because
for once the port authority did not do a very good
job of publicizing this major change in traffic flow
through the university area.

The day after the accident involving Kormanik,

PAT representative Mel Seidenberg said that

“studentshave to remember to look both ways.”
“We’re very concerned that people coming out of
the dorms forget this and only look one way,”

5 Seidenberg said.

We appreciate the concern PAT has shown in
rendering some aid to the commuter who must fight
Oakland traffic congestion each and every day, but
we would appreciate some prior notice.

This is one area wherewe can’t afford to learn
from mistakes. -

Pitt's Medieval Ambush 

In architecture we talk” much

 about semantics. Welike to have

buildings express something about
 their internal functions throu
‘ their design. 

- A recent ecperience with the Of- A

fice of Student Accounts and the‘
ombudsman for student affairs.
. respectively, makes me feel as-if the
I ‘_ . administration at Pitt were attemp-
  ting to perfect this match with the
A ' \ Cathedral of Learning’s‘ Gothic
design by introducing medieval am-
‘ bush practices. .- '

- The issue: On Sept. 2, I returned
from .a vacation trip to Europe. I
opened my mailbox and found my

; V, ' "invoice: payment due by Aug. 14. I
 obviously could not meet the
 deadline and was due for a late fee
of $25. Rightly so. After all, it is my
duty to ensure timely payment in
advance. I agree that absence is no
' nexcuse for being exempt from the
duty of timely payment.

 

 

9 However: I expect administrative
 '_ demands with regard to my obliga-
* » -tions to be predictable——and I feel
. A entitled to expect such predictable

behavior-. Predictablility, ‘a vital re-
 , quirement for responsible
 budgeting of one’s resources, was
ii. -' "not an asset of the Pitt invoice
1%: policy, though.

 

 

1) In Fall 1979, my invoice pay-
‘ment wasdue by Sept. 13.
2). Searching my university

  

records prior to my departure to

. Europe, I could not find any state-

ment indicating that the 1980 prac-
tice might in any way deviate from
the. Fall 1979 invoice policy. '

3) My roommate, herself too a

very consciencious and responsible ~

Pitt student, went to check per-
sonally, asking at the registrar's of-
fice, and was assured that the in-
voice payment would not be due

until early September.

dd Jointly, my roommate an'd‘I had

- taken all care that could be

"reasonably expected from us, to en-
sure timely payment. '

The same can’t be said of the‘
university ombudsman. In my case, _

he did grant a waiver of the assessed
late fee, but not in the case of my
roommate! We both had appealed
on virtually identical grounds and
submitted ample evidence to back
us up. _ "

Except for granting the late fee
waiver in one case, while rejecting,
it in—the other, his letters are iden-

tical in content. In no way does he.

accept any responsibility for the
university for unpredictable ad-
ministrative behavior. In no way
does he accept the fact that my

» roommate and I had taken all care

that -could be expected to ensure
timely payment. In no way did he
apologize for,‘ what I feel is, a
medieval style of adminstrative am-

 

bush in the form of a tuition hike
through the back door. Not even
part of the responsibility was
assumed "by the university. Inhis
judgement, the sole responsibility
rested with us. .

I have reason to believe from my
experience that other students, too,

caught off guard by the medieval.

robber knights’ ambush by unex-
pectedly changing the invoice" pay-
ment date without due" advance
notice. Not everyone has been as
fortunate as me to experience the
ombudsman in the V role of a
generous Santa Claus,‘ granting a

waiver that he feltlwe” were not en-

titled to in the first place. I feel they
are entitled to the waiver in spite of
his personal or administrative opi-

nion. Through this letter, I hope to ~

get across what I perceive as_ a_
strategy of individualizing ‘the issue
through the red tape of individual

appeals. I wish to encourage those. ’

that “got turned down. on what I
believe to be unjustifiable grounds,
to reappeal their case. We should
protest jointly the unacceptable
backdoor tuition hikes, induced by
unexpectable deadlines that, with
all reasonable care, can not be met
in time.

The university has to
acknowledge the duty to behave
predictably. We do. not live in
medieval times anymore, and work-
ing in _a Gothic style building is no
excuse for adopting medieval am-
bush practices, is it?

I 1 Boaters Facelndianain Finalseason Contest 

By ANNA ARLOTTA
Pitt News Sports Writer

The Pitt soccer team, after win-
ning five consecutive games early in
the season, have equaled that
number in the loss column when
they were defeated by Bucknell 5-0
on Wednesday afternoon.
‘Something is simply not coming
together for the once successful

-booters and tomorrow, with the‘

final_ game of the season against In-
diana, the Panthers will try to find
what that missing link is.

Coming off two losses last week
to nationally ranked Penn State,

- 2-0, and West Virginia University,

   

4-0, the Panthers looked to the
Bucknell contest as being the game
to get them back on the winning
track. Unfortunately for Pitt,
Bucknell believed quite the con-
trary. Three quick goals in the first
20 minutes ‘of Wednesday’s game
stumbled the Panthers enough that
they had very little spark at coming
back for a victory. .
With three minutes gone in the
first half of play Pitt found
themselves down 1-0 when

Bucknell’s Brian Hassinger took a A

pass from teammate Duncan Lee
and put one past the outstreched
arm_s_ qf__ goalkeeper John Bonessi.

arts

The ball was played off a rebound
from a Bonessi save. Just five
minutes later Bucknell was again on
the board when it was Lee assisting
this time to John Krupka, who took
a hard shot to the far corner of the
goal. A

“They had some tough. luck at
Bucknell this season,” said coach
Leo Bemis, ,“but against -us they
doing everything right and scoring
goals.” _

Whythe sudden turnaround in
the Panther booters season? The
loss of intensity. seems to be the
popular opinion within the squad.
Coach Bemis believes it is the same,

amidst a number of other variables.

“It started when we lost to a fine
Bethany club who are having a win-
ning season. They have only lost to
a couple of nationally ranked clubs
and they are ranked in the country.
In that contest we didn't play good
enough to win, but then in a loss to
Edinboro we played such .a poor
game that we could not have won.
In a game like the one with Penn
State last week, we played excep-
tionally fine soccer against a good
team, as with WVU, who was very
skilled.”

One high point in the Bucknell
contest was a fine save by Bonessi

on a penalty kick. Bonessi started
his first game of the season on a
switch by Bemis. Fullback Tom
Kunkel had fouled _a Bucknell

player in the penalty area forcing

Bonessi to have the confrontation
with Paul Devlin from the 12 yard
line. With a quick accurately played
move to the right Bonessi saved the
ball and the third score of the day
by Bucknell. It looked as if this
move could possibly be theturning
point in the game but the Panthers
didnot pickup enough of the need-

ed momentum to put the ball in the

net and come within one goal.

. Syracuse quarterback Bill Hurley
is gone, butthe Pitt Panther foot-
ball team will have to contend with
another outstanding Orangeman

, tomorrow in running back Joe

Morris. Last week, Morris returned
from a three week hiatus rush for
157 yards on 31 carries, scoring one
touch down against Rutgers. He
has now passes Larry Csonka in
career yardage at Syracuse, with
3,022 yards in three years.

When Hurley was at Syracuse, he
gave the Panther defense fits, _
averaging 256 yards in total offense
in his three appearances against Pitt
and Orange coach Frank Maloney
is looking for the same kind of ner-
formance from Morris.‘ _

Pitt assistant coach Bob Davie

‘called Morris “probably the best

back we will face all year and with
him healthy, it gives the Syracuse
offense great versatility.”

“Morris is" a great running back
who’s extremely difficult to defense
because of his size,” saidPitt coach
Jackie Sherrill. “If you’re a spec-
tator, he’s a back you enjoy wat-
ching. He’s so quick and he gives
-100 percent on every play. He puts
everything he has into every carry.”

Morris was a_ big factor in theeilr

Orange’s 18-17 near-upset of the
Panthers in 1978 as he ran for 149
yards. Last year, Morris was held
to 98 yards by the Pitt defense in a
28-21 Pitt win. If Morris is able to
gain over. 100 yards tomorrow, he
will be only the second back to do
so this season, Florida State’s Sam
Platt being the other.

  Miami to Provide Stern Test for Nittan y Lions

By ASSOCIATE PRESS

STATE COLLEGE, Pa. Booker
Moore wasn’t exactly thrilled when
Penn State coach Joe Paterno ask-
ed him to switch from tailback to
fullback_.

The 210-pound senior had played
three seasons at tailback. He played
the position in high school, and felt
he was ready for his best effort. The
senior year isn’t exactly the time to
try a new job.

Moore,’ however, accepted the

change, philosophically charging it
to_a team concept.

If fullback was where they need-
ed him, fullback he would play. '

The switch has worked for both _

Moore and the team. His running as
a fullback is a big reason the Nit-
tany Lions meet Miami tomorrow

with a 6-1 record. He’s gained 524

yards, an average of 7.1 yards per

carry.

In fact, _if Moore can have a
111-yard game against the 4-2 Hur-
ricanes, he’l1 become the seventh
runner in Penn State history to gain
2,000 yards or more in a career.

“I think now I’m beginning to
like playing fullback,” said Moore
before a practice session this week.

"‘I’m finally making the ad-

justments. I feel at home.”

Moore admits he had some
doubts as to whether he could make
the change. He wasn’t sure that. he
was physically able to do the impor-
tant job of fullback blocking.

“That was ' the major
adjustment,” Moore explained. He

feels that he has, made it. He likes

lining up closer to the line of scrim-

mage.

“I’m able to pop through the.
hole and get into the secondary
rather quickly,” Moore said.
Moore has cast from his mind an
off field problem that forced Pater-
no to suspendhim for one game last
season.

“I decided just not to look
back,” he explained. “I told myself
it’s a new year and I’d start all over
again.”

Moore has looked at Miami on
films and says he sees a team with a
strong, physical defense. He views
the Hurricanes as a very good foot-
ball team. He’s also leery of
Miami’s passing attack.

But Moore says he’s sure of one
thing. - '

. Penn State’s sometimes

‘This year we know they’re
good. Last year we took them for
granted. They basically came here
and outplayed us. They were ready
to play and we weren’t,” Moore
said. Miami won 26-10.

Moore isn’t concerned about
unim-
pressive play despite the 6-1 record.

“We knew we’d have a lot of
people playing new positions. I
figured we’d need experience. But I
can feel it coming together. I think
we’re ready to take off as a team,”
Moore said. Miami won its first
four, then lost to Notre Dame and
Mississippi State. Penn State beat
Colgate and Texas A&M, lost -to
Nebraska, and has won ‘con-
secutively over Missouri, ‘Maryland,
Syracuse and West Virginia.

,, I

On offense, Miami has an ex-_1-

plosive team. Jim Kelly was a
freshman, makinghis first start in
the Penn State game last year, when
‘he passed for 280 yards and threw‘

. three touchdown passes. He. is hav-

ing another good year this fall.

“They have dangerous wide-outs
in Larry Brodsky and Jim Joiner,
who combined for three
touchdowns‘ against us last year,
and who are averaging almost 20
yards a_,catch year,” Moore said.

Lorenzo Roan heads up a group
of running backs who can really
run. '-

“I think the game is an excellent
challenge for our young team,”
said -Moore. “We can’t_ make the
mistakes we made last week if; we
want to win.

Syracuse domed stadium, Carrier
Dome which was opened at the start

of the 1980 campaign. The Orange

plalyed 15 straight road games after
construction of the new stadium
began.

Sherrill is concerned about the
mental side of the game as he feels
that the Panthers can hold their
own with just about any team in/the

. physical side of the game.

“This will be the fifth con-
ecutive week of tough preparations
and games,” Sherrill said. “I’m
concerned how mentally fsharp
we’re going to_be. It's tough to stay
‘up’ all the time. You can wear
yourself down. Maryland, Florida
State, West Virginia, Tennessee and
Syracuse--all in a row--are a tough

assignment. ’ ’ .

Earlier in the season, Sherrill
likened these five games to the
“war” of the season. The Panthers
have won three of the battles, but
lost ‘a tough decision to Florida
State. Sherrill is hoping that Pan-
thers are not “down” against
Syracuse and can win the final bat-
tle of the war before Pitt goes

against patsies Louisville and At-

my, tuning up for .the big game
-3 against -Penn State.

Syracuse will be no patsy,—

though, as the Orangemen have
compiled a 4-3 record and given
, Penn State and Ohio State a rough
time before falling. Syracuse ac-

tually led Ohio State throughout the

entire contest before the Buckeyes
took control to win 31-21. Penn
State had a hard time with the
Orange before winning 24-7.

The Orangemen not only have

Morris, but also agdouble threati

quarterback in Dave Warner. He is

 the team's ‘second leading rusher

with 423 yards on 96 carries and has
completed 49 of 102 passes for 617

yards and three touchdowns. His.

leading receiver is tight‘ end, Tony

235 yards and one touchdown.
“Warner has done a great job_for

them in replacing Bill Hurley,” said I

Sherrill. “He’s really helped them

move the football. Their tight end .

(Sidor) is also outs_tanding_. A They’ve
done a good job putting things
together offensively.” '

The Panthers will counter the.
Syracuse offensive attack with ’a .
defense whichranks as one of the ‘
finest in the nation. The Panthers
have yet to give up a touchdown

rushing this season, limiting op- ‘

ponents to just seven touchdown
passes and one TD kickoff return.
According to NCAA statistics, the
Pitt defense ranks first against the
rush, allowing an average of 58.4-
yards per game. The Panthers are
tied for first with Nebraska in total
defense (193.6 yards per game) and
number 10 against the score (10.9.
points per game). Offensivelv. Pitt

‘Ram QB Ferragamo  
insures His Arm

ANAHEIM, Calif. Quarterback

_ Vince Ferragamo, whose million-
‘3‘dollar arm has nearly 20 times the
value of his contractwith the Los

Angeles Rams, says he is consider- _

ing insuring his arm for about $1

million until he can negotiate a.

long-term deal.
_ “If I can’t work out something
with the Rams I don’t want to gain-

ble on suffering a disabling injury,” _

said Ferragamo, hero of the Rams’
near-miss loss to Pittsburgh in pro
football’s Super Bowl last January.

‘Now midway through the option
year of a reported $52,00-a—year
contract, Ferragamo could become

a National Football League free.

agent when this season is over. And
he has added to his -negotiating
power by leading the National
I Football League quarterback
ratings in 1980. ' .

Little used in his first 2 ‘/2 years as
a pro, his value soared as he led the
Rams into and through the playoffs
after becoming a starter at mid-
‘season last year. For the past two
weeks Ferragamo has been the top-
rated passer in the NFL, completing
64.1 percent of his throws for 1,601
yards and 14 touchdowns.

As a result he’s on the threshold
of a probable $1 million-plus,
multi-year contract with the Rams
or another team. But aserious in-
jury in the meantime could leave
Ferragamo with‘ nothing.

“The problem is that it's real ex-
pensive, for short term policies,” he
said of his interest in insuring his
strong right arm.

“Lloyds of London is the only
company I know that makes up
policies like that for professional
athletes,” Ferragamo told the Los
Angeles Herald Examiner.

“The more I play without a con-
tract, ‘the hotter things get all the
time,” said Ferragamo. But he also 1
has a warm feeling when he thinks
about what he would have accepted
from the Rams just afew months
ago;

"‘I’m lucky I didn’t sign,” he ad-
ded. “Things worked out a lot bet-
ter for me this way. What I would
have signed for then and now is
quite a contrast.”

Ferragamo recently took per-
sonal charge of his negotiations
with Rams‘ General Manager Don
Klosterman. Ferragamo won’t say
what he seeks, but he concedes little '
progress toward agreement has
been made in his four meetings with
Klosterman in recent weeks.

A debate over who should play
quarterback. ended -suddenly in the
season opener. Pat Haden, No. 1
with the Rams since 1976 with a
contract for about $200,000 a year,
suffered a broken index finger late
in a loss to Detroit.

Ferragamo’s first start also was a V

loss, at Tampa Bay. Since then Fer-

. ragamo led the Rams to five straight

victories before succumbing to the
blitzing tactics of the Atlanta
Falcons in a 13-10 loss Sunday.
Atlanta and Los Angeles are tied
for first place in the Western Divi-
sion of the National Football Con-
ference. . . '

Another five minutes passed and

"it was Bucknell who successfully

found the net after Peter Mulany
took a pass from Andy Sayles and
beat the Panther defense. Mulany
went one on one with Bonessi and
found a hole to place the ball into.

“I don’t think that our problem
is the fact that we are not in condi-
tion,” said Bemis. “We played 11
men throughout most of the Penn
State game against a very tough
team and we played a good game.
So it’s more than being out of
shape. We have to get back the con-
fidence to score_ like we had early in
the year. The ‘mental attitude has to
change, and just a good effort is not

going to change things. That would.

only partially change things. With
Indiana being our final game of the

season on Saturday we will need a

win to start a turnabout.’.’

In the second half of the Bucknell
game the Panthers could not find
the needed intensity to evenput a
goal on the board. Pitt has not
scored a goal since the loss to Edin-
boro two weeks ago, which came on
a penalty kick by midfielder Al
Adelmann, a very
agressive player, has the determina-
tion and desire to put things
together on the field with his ball
control and passing. On Wednesday
Adelmann found himself playing
the majority of anyone in the mid-
field when a number of changes and
substitutions took place. ‘ Fullback
Jim Hackworth was taken out early
in the second half because'of the
knee injury hampering his play.
That move initially put forward
John Pizzella in the outside
fullback position then another
move found senior midfielder Dan-
HY Hamm dropping back to the
defense. Hamm, who has played
fullback in all his years of soccer,
except for the last two, put in a fine"
game in both positions. Other
moves in the midfield saw Chris
Richmond and Adelmann sharing
time with Scott Norton and Nick

iWilson. -

Bucknell scored two more goals,
one coming halfway in the second

Panthers Ranked 11th 

half when Hassinger put on the
moves and passed the Pitt defense
to score his second of the day. With
nine minutes remaining to be played
in the contest another penalty was
called on the Panthers within the 18
when stopper Tom Trempus was
nabbed for a handball violation.
This time a shot by Mulany was suc-
cessful and the score stayed at 5-0
for the final putcome.

The Panthers will look to tomor-
row’s game for a win to wind up a

mediocre season. A victory over In- ‘

diana would «put Pitt over the .500
mark with a final record of 8-7. In-.
diana will be a tough team to defeat
because the 10-2 Indians will be
looking for a possible top ranking
in Division One of the Western Pen-
nsylyania Intercollegiate Soccer
Conference. To date Slippery Rock,
who defeated the Panthers but were
defeated by Indiana, is in first place
of the WPISC with a 7-2 conference
-record. They are followed by the In-
dians who are four points behind
with a 5-2 record. A win over the
Panthers would tie the Indians with
Slippery Rock.

Intensity, according to forward‘

Troy Norton, needs to be regained
if he and his teammates are to be
successful tomorrow. “We’ve lost
our intensity, our desire,” said Nor-
ton. “Every game that we play
seems like practice anymore. People
just aren’t holding their ground out
there on the field and there is a’bi_g
let down amongst the team. It felt
great winning all those games at the
beginning of the season but it seems
like nobody cares anymore. One
thing I must say though, is that
when we substituted at Bucknell,
those players really gave 110 percent
the whole time that they were in.
“I really want to win this last
game,” said Norton, “and go out
on a winning note. What we need is
to get together and play like a team,

like the team that we were at the A

beginning of the year. We’ve got to
get intense and’ want to win.”
Game time is set for 1:00 p.m.
and students are asked to enter gate
10 at Pitt Stadium». It will be the
final contest for Panthers Hamm,
Kunkel, and Bonessi.

The focus is on people

part of life on campus, Hopbell

- said. De-emphasizing seniors is an

attempt to increase" the
marketabaility of the book to a

larger number of students, he add- V

eg. This is absolutely necessary if

the yearbook is ‘to survive at all,

Hopbell said. - _
“If we don’t sell 1,000 books this

“year,” Hopbell said, “there’s a

good chance ‘that the yearbook
won’t be around next year. It’s too
expensive to produce the size and

, quality ‘of a book for 8 or 900 peo-

ple.”

In 1971, the editor inherited a
‘$10,000 budget deficit, a common
occurrence in the past decade, ac-
cording to Hopbell. The book
manages to stay in print only
because of the concern of two
dynamic people who are representa-
tives from the publishing company,

 Hopbell said. If it weren’t for these

two, the book wouldn’t be in print,
he added.

The biggest problem in pro-
moting sales is the size of the cam-
pus itself, Hopbell said.

“The campus is so spread out
that there are no effective com-
according to

Hopbell. “The most effective

=7-advertising that the yearbook does

‘is through a home mailing system.
Letters are sent to the parents of
students around Christmas time,
suggesting a yearbook as a possible
Christmas gift.”

Hopbell said this system is expen- A

sive for the yearbook to support,
and is not the most convenient way
to purchase a book.

“We’re trying to make it as con-
venient and cheap for everyone that

‘we can,” Hopbellsaidf The year- -
book, when purchased at the right .

time, can be bought at a discount.

according to Hopbell. The book
