raised

By Joe Zeff

Associate Editor

If Phil Moyer, the Student’

Government Board president-
elect, has his way, University of
Pittsburgh students will face tui-
tion increases next September.

Moyer plans to hold a referen-
dum early next year to determine
student support for a higher “stu-
dent activities fee. . ‘

Ful|—ti me students presently pay
$24 per term, and part-time stu-
dents pay $8 per term. The-total
fees collected, which Moyer es:
timated to be $730,000 annual-
ly, are administered to student
organizations under’ the auspices
of the Office of Student Activities.

”lt definitely’ needs to be in-
creased,” Moyer said Monday.

”The amount we're working
with is minimal compared to the
amount we need. l know that a
lot of organizations are upset
about not getting ‘money. We
didn't have any money to give
them.” '

Moyer has not decided how
much to increase thefee.

”At this time,:l really can't de-

termine a set figure. Previously I ’

had stated $15. I still like the
figure, but we would have to see
if $15 would cover it.”

The SGB receives half of the
fees, with which it funds itself and
more than 120 certified student
organizations. The Pitt Program

- Council receives 35 percent, the

Student Publications Board 12.5
percent and WPTS-FM 2.5
percent. ' ~ -

Moyer, who served on the SGB
allocations committee, said that
student ‘organizations requested
roughly $945,000 for this fiscal
-year. The SGB allocated
$360,978, including $64,260 to
itself, according to Moyer-

’’It was very, very difficult. We
ended upcutting a lot of pro-

grams that really-could have been A

beneficial,” Moyer said. ”We all
agreed that the student activities
fee should have been increased
for this upcoming year, but noth-
ing was- done about it by the
present board."

SGB president. Jim Mumma

said his board addressed the topic p

but found it complicated. "
The fee was last raised by the

board of trustees in 1980. It had

ate Abuse

Professor researches Pitt students  

By Frances Sansig
-Staff Writer

An alarming number of inci-
dents of date abuse at Pitt have
caused a member of the psychol-
ogy department to take notice.

Irene Frieze, a professor of psy- ’

chology and women's studies, is
in the process of studying a sur-

' vey she conducted dealing with
' reactions to victimization.

She asked 700 students, most-

" ly from the introduction to psy-
chology course, if they have ever .

been beaten by a friend, lover or
spouse.

She said that of the data she has -

analyzed, seven percent of wom-
en and eight percent of men
reported that an instance of such
abuse occurred at least once.
’’If it happened 10 years ago,
they probably wouldn't have told
anyone," said Frieze. -
”|t’s a fairly hidden kind of
thing that happens. People don't
realize what's going on. There's

pens. People don ’t real-

often a reluctance — to believe
there's any kind of interpersonal
violence.”

She said this denial is similar to
that expressed about child abuse
and molestation, before it came
to be accepted that it was hap-
pening. _

”There tends to be a general
kind of denial about these things
happening to/women,” she said.

Frieze said most men surveyed,
who reported they were beaten,
said it was by a friend and did not
seem to take the matter too
seriously.

”When men fight with men, no
one’s upset. But women who
fight with men get very upset,”
said Frieze.

"After reviewinga sampling of
the surveys, Frieze noted that
women who were victims ofdate
abuse often felt embarrassed and
blamed themselves for choosing
the wrong partner.

Other women said they ”felt
scared and helpless,” or ”didn’t
date any men for two years after-
wards.” One even saidshe ’’felt
like a fool,” according to Frieze.

’/Most of the students surveyed
were either in their late teens or
early 20s.

’’I had no idea what was hap-
pening with Pitt students,” said
Frieze. .

What Frieze says is puzzling is
that most of the women who told

friends they had been abused by
_a boyfriend said their friends

reacted with shock and seemed

to be surprised.

Student
car pool

program

discussed

By Jim Urban 3
Editor-in-Chief

The University of Pittsburgh
Ridesharing Office, in conjunc-

tion with the Office of Student

Activities, has begun efforts to in-
stigate a carpool system for com-
muting students at the university,
according to Kathleen Mille‘r,

coordinator of the Ridesharing  

Office.

Approximately two-thirds of _
the student population at the

Oakland campus is comprised of
commuters, Miller said. Addition-

ally, Oakland has the third largest '

daily traffic flow in Pennsylvania,
behind only Philadelphia and
downtown Pittsburgh.

Three different schools, Pitt,
Carnegie Mellon and Carlow Col-
lege, along with the University

_ Health Center, attract a majority

of the estimated 100,000 cars that "

crow_d into Oakland daily. .
“Eighty percent of those are
‘ one-car, one-driver,” Miller said.
”We are looking for an alterna-
tive to that.” .
Currently, approximately 5,000
University Health Center em-
ployees take part in a similar pro-
gram, Miller said. Efforts to
organize student carpooling in
the past .have been unsuccessful,
however, and this time a differ-
ent approach is being taken.
Approximately 18,000 com-
muter students, both graduate
and undergraduate, will receive
a survey in the mail early next
week from the Office "of Student
Activities..The survey, comprised

of approximately 30 questions, _'

asks about transportation habits,

scheduling and possible car-

poohng.

. ’’Whether or not there -is an in-
terest in ridesharing at all is what
we hope to find out,” said Dr.
Terry Milani, acting director of
student activities. ”We are op-
timistic about gaining new under-
standing about our commuter
population.”

Currently, employees from the
University Health Center take ad-
vantage of 19 vanpools and over
100 carpools, according to the
Ridesharing Office. Miller said
there is no limit on traveling dis-
tance either. Health Center car-

Reagan was unaware of deal with Contras

’ WASHINGTON (AP) —

President Reagan's national se-
curity adviser resigned yesterday,
and a key aide was fi red after the
White House learned that up to
$30 million, received from the
secret sale of weapons to Iran,
had been transferred to U.S.-
backed Contras fighting the
Nicaraguan government.

Attorney General Edwin Meese
said the money, the proceeds of
U.S.-sanctioned arms sales by Is-
rael to Iran, wound up in Swiss
bank accounts controlled by the
Contras.

The disclosure came as Reagan
announced that Vice Adm. John
Poindexter had asked for reas-
signment after nearly a year as na-
tional security adviser. He said Lt.
Col. Oliver North, an aide on the
National Security Council staff,
”has been relieved of his duties.”

Reagan made his announce-
ment at an appearance in the

White House briefing room in
which he repeated that he had
made no mistake in approving
the secret sale of arms to Iran.
”And I'm not taking any more
questions,” he responded tartly to
reporters who sought to interrupt
his prepared statement.

But in defending his policy, he ‘

added, ’’I was not fully informed
on the nature of one element [of
the arms sale].”

He said he had asked Meese to
conduct a review of the sale, and
added he would appoint a special
board to review the role of the
National Security Council in for-
eign policy.

Meese said $10 million to $30
million obtained from the sale of
weapons to Iran had been divert-
ed to the ”forces in Central
America.” Meese said the money
was transferred in January. That
was before Congress approved a
resumption of military aid to the

 

0°03>°0°0>°®°®°®'®>°®*63>

Contra rebels last month.

”The only person who precise-
ly knew about this was Col.
North,” Meese said.

He said Poindexter knew
something about the operation
and ”he did not try to stop it.”

”No American person handled
the money,” Meese continued.

Asked whether North ‘faced
possible legal action, Meese said,
”We are presently looking into
the legal aspects of it as to
whether there was any criminal-
ity involved.” .

The announcement marked the
latest turn in a political and diplo-
matic controversy that has
mushroomed, into one of the
most damaging of Reagan's
presidency. '

Reagan would not say if there

Clarification

It was incorrectly. reported
in the Mon., Nov. 24 edition
that Cam Baker and Richard
Platt have been accused of
criminal trespass and simple
assault. The two have been ac-
cused of harrassment.

Additionally, Mark McCor-
mick was misquoted in the
same story. Monday's edition
quoted McCormick as saying,
”Don came out and threw
Rick against the wall.” It I
should have read, ”Don came
out and threw Cam against the
wall.” ‘ _ «

Hillel protests apartheid  

By Matthew Thornton
Staff Writer

A new voice was added to the

I cry for total divestment this week.

The Pitt Hillel club held a rally at
the Students For a Free South Afri-
ca shanty Monday afternoon,
quoting readings for the op-
pressed people in South Africa.

In an assembly entitled ”Ex-
pression of Freedom —. A Jewish
Response to Aparthied in South
Africa,” the Hillel club made
their position concerning divest-
ment public.

”lt’s an important movement to
rally behind,” said Leon Morris,
a Pitt freshman and organizer of
the service. ”I wanted to raise
consciousness in the Jewish com-
munity.”

The 17 people assembled
heard a comparison between the
oppressed in South Africa and the
Jews enslaved in Egypt.

and sisters everywhere,” said

Rabbi Joseph Levine.

Morris says -he is not sure what
the outcome of the assembly will
be or whether the Jewish students

will occupy the shanty.

He does, though, see the need
for Pitt's total divestment from

‘companies doing business
South Africa.

‘-’I’m demanding that if [people]
don’t think divestment is a good
idea, they should propose a bet-

ter way,” Morris stated.

Morris outlined the position of
the Jewsvin the rally, frequently
citing historical references and

prayers.

”This self-identification with
the past stirs in us an appreciation
of the freedom that is ours,” Mor-
ris read, ”and an empathy with
those of our brothers and sisters
who still dwell under the sh_adow

of modern-day Pharaohs."

”It doesn't mean anything if
you don't take the words and put

them into action.” he said.

Rabbi Hailu Mosha Paris,
spiritual leader of Mt. Horeb
Congregation in New York Ci-
ty's East Bronx, spoke Thurs-
day night about the history
and culture of Ealasha Jews.
I The program was sponsored
by the University of Pitts-
in burgh’s Hillel Club.

Paris spoke of the current
plight ofthe 7,000 to 10,000
Jews still in Ethiopia, most "of
whom are women, children
and elderly.

The life expectancy among
the Ethiopian Jews is 39 years,
and the infant mortality rate is
nearly 50 percent, according
to Paris.

Life in Ethiopia for black
Jews is not easy. Most of their
villages are closed to outsiders
and tightly controlled by the
military. They are denied the

Most make their living by do-
ing metal work, according to

right to own their own land. _

a film Paris showed.

”The living conditions are
unsanitary,” he said. The
government has also outlawed
the teaching of Hebrew.

About 16,000 Ethiopians
now live in Israel because of
operations ”Moses” and
”Joshua,” which were at-
tempts to airlift Jews from
Ethiopia into Israel.‘

Some rabbinical authorities
don't recognize the Ethiopians
as Jews and will not unless
they go through a conversion
ritual. In 1975, the Rabbinical
Council of Israel ruled that
they were Jews, Paris said.

According to Paris, customs
and traditions give validity to
their claim of Jewish identity.
They adhere to laws express-
Iy stated in the Torah, the set
of five books of Moses upon
which most of the laws of the
religion are based.

”[Their] Yom Kippur is a 24-
hour day of prayer and fasting
similar to ours in the Western
world,” Paris said.

Rabbi: Ethiopians oppressed

They also maintain dietary
laws. ”Meat and milk are not
mixed,” he said.

The Falashas do not
celebrate Hanukkah because it
is a relatively new holiday not
found in the Old Testament.

”The division of families has
created problems both in
Ethiopia and lsrael,” Paris stat-
ed. There's controversy over
whether Israel did all they
could to help get the rest of the
Jews in Ethiopia out.

Paris said there are basical-
ly two ways to try and deal
with this problem. The first is
to put political pressure on the
U.S. government who may put
pressure on the Israeli govern-
ment to release these Jews.

Paris came to America i_n
I936 from Ethiopia after he
was lucky enough to be adopt-
ed by a black Jewish couple.

Paris has a congregation of
40 black Jewish families. He is
on the board of directors of the
American Association for
Ethiopian Jews.

Long-awaited hazing
law benefits Greeks

Last Tuesday, the Pennsylvania Senate passed House
Bill ‘No. 749, also known as the Antihazing Law. The act
defines hazing as any action or situation which ”reck|essly
or intentionally endangers the mental or physical health
of a student." for purposes of admission into any organi-
zation sanctioned by a college or university.

The law prohibits not only obvious physical abuse, but
also such incidents as forced consumption of alcohol,
sleep deprivation, forced exclusion from social contact,
or any ”forced activity which could adversely affect the
mental health or dignity of the individual.”

One important stipulation of the Antihazing Law is that
the willingness of an individual to participate in an ac-

Iohn Enright, Sports Editor

tivity has no effect on the classification of the activity as ,

”forced.” If admission into an organization is based upon
the activity, no matter how willing the student may be to
participate, the activity is still considered forced.
Although many of the situations outlined in the Anti-
hazing Law are already prohibited by both university po_li—
cy and national fraternity and sorority policies, the passage

of the bill is an important symbolic gesture as well. Vio— '

lation of the Antihazing Law will be considered a mis-
demeanor of the third degree. Universities will be required
by law to adopt their own antihazing policies and to de-
fine penalties for violations. Although most universities
already have such policies, it is a long—overdue recogni-
tion by the state Senate of the gravity of the situation.
Such student organizations exist as a celebration of
friendship. Mental and physical abuse have no place in

. that celebration. We congratulate not only the state

government, but also those student organizations which
have independently adopted and upheld their own anti-
hazing policies.

"MY FRATENITY Dos N

Giving thanks — for what?

So there was this space to be
filled on the opinion page, see,
and everyone was either gone for

Thanksgiving or too hungry to V

write.

It was suggested that I write a
list of things for which we should
be thankful. A list such as this is
easy to write and is often called
a ”bullet column.” When you
see one of these in a newspaper,
it is usually because the writer is

Any student at Pitt who has
ever waited in line for 90 minutes
or so, only to be turned away be-
cause of some minor technicali-
ty will sympathize with my latest
and greatest encounter with the

A red tape so prevalent at Pitt.

I am a biology major in my
senior year, and I thought I had
already withstood every snag that
had ever been invented by the
powers that be, here at Pitt.
However, I was wrong. The latest
episode in the saga of ”Trying to
Graduate” is ugly  real ugly.

Last spring I signed up for three

% biology classes, assuming they

would complete my major, be-
cause these classes were given
the OK by my advisor. One of
these classes was an honors class
called "Structure and Function of
Human Tissue” and was being
taught by one of the faculty mem-
bers‘ of the Pitt Medical School.

I had taken another honors class

,the,first year med students.

taught at the medical school and
found the material challenging
and the teacher excellent. There-
in lies the problem  the fact that
I had taken another honors class.
Naughty, naughty student took
more than one honors class 
only one counts toward your

major. What is the reason for this .

utter nonsense?

”IT’S [the class] OUT OF THE
DEPARTMENT.”

I have several problems with
this excuse:

1. Why didn't anyone tell me
that this class counts toward ab-
solutely nothing? I don't need
elective credits; I already have
over 120 credit hours.

2. According to the three
powers that decide if I graduate
or not, I have to prove the worth
of this class. The class is an
honors class and containsjthe
same material that they teach to

LETTERS

3. I was told that the advisor
that OK’d my classes is no longer
an advisor. To this I say: So what?
She was when she said that the
class could go toward my major.

4. The unresponding way in
which my case was handled, i.e.
”We’ll get back to you.”

I am sorry, but I really don't be-

' lieve the excuse that the class is

out of the department — and I am
at a total loss as to what to do
about it. Maybe I'll just take bi-
ology classes for the rest of my
life — until one ”counts.”

THE PITT NEWS, Wednesday, November 26, 1986

When you think of the word
”coach,” the image that comes to
mind is that of a college or NFL
head man prowling the football
sidelines, full of anger and frus-
tration, no matter what is going
on out on the_ field.

Now comes the news, though,
that another kind of coach has
opened up a business out in
California. Her name is Carolyn
Kellams. She is 41, years old, _she
lives in San Francisco, and her ti-
tle is dating coach. -

”I started coaching dating four
years ago, in I982,” Kellams

said. ”The whole idea behind it _

was that everything is a learnable
skill. Everything can be observed
and be broken down into learna-
ble segments.” . ‘
Kellams thought that San Fran-
cisco was an ideal place for a dat-

' ing coach to hang out her shingle.

”Things are pretty desperate
here,” she said. ”The stereotype
is that all of the men here are
either married or gay.”

So she began coaching people
on dating skills in San Francisco.
In the intervening years, she has
branched out all over the coun-
try, offering seminars as well as
individual coaching. sessions.

”No matter where I go,” she

41

Now go on out t

said, ”every person says, ‘We
have it the worst here.’ People in
every city think that their own
city is the worst in the country for
dating."

She said she finds that she must
advise her clients about the most
elementary facets of dating.

”One of the first things I teach
is how to begin and continue a
conversation.” she said. ”People
really do need this help. Walking
into a room and having a conver-
sation can be a very, very hard
thing for people. More people
than you are aware of are terrified
at the very thought of it.”

Most of the people she coaches
are very down on themselves
when they come to her for help.

”Any time a person goes to any

kind of a counselor, that person

is in a lot of pain,” Kellams said.
”When you feel good about
yourself, you do not seek help. I
talk to women in their 30s who
are doing marvelously in their

careers. Their business skills are,

great. But theyfind that, in the
course of developing those busi-

ness skills, they have lost their _

dating skills. They have no idea

how to deal with a man.”
Kellams coaches both women

and men. ”I see a lot ofdivorced

here

  

I  I‘ M s .

men who are out on the dating
scene for the first time since col-
lege and who find that all the
rules have changed,” she said.
”And I see women who went

through college telling every one
of their boyfriends that they were

saving themselves for their hus- ‘

bands. Now they're divorced,
and they don't know what to do.
”They wonder when it is ap-

" propriate to go to bed with some-

one they are attracted to. If things
are going well on the first date,
is it OK to go to bed? And if it's
not OK, how do they know when
it is OK to start an intimate rela-
tionship? Some of them feel kind
of silly even asking about these
things — they think that they are

too old to be wondering about
them. But there's nobody to set
any guidelines for them.”

One of the first things that Kel-
lams does is ask the people she
is coaching to write down a list
of .10 things that they consider
valuable about themselves.

”My reason for going through
that exercise is that if they can't
come up with 10 reasons to like
themselves, then how can they
expect other people to like them?

”But you'd be surprised how_

hard it is for some people to make
that list. A woman physician
_ came to me for coaching,’ and
when I asked her to write down
10 things she liked about herself,
I could see the terror in her eyes.

She said to me, ‘If I have to write"

down 10 things I like about my-
self, we'll be here all night.’

’’I was astonished. It would
seem so easy for a woman like
her.to make a list. Think of the
obvious qualities she had: com-
passion, a willingness to help

others, a high degree of skill at
her profession  but in her mind,
those things must not have count-
ed. Without my prodding, she
couldn’t think of anything good
to say about herself.”

Kellams said that her dating

 

and win the (dating) game!

‘coaching so far has__ been con-

fined to adults — mainly people

in their 20s, 30s and 40s. She said_

that although she has not
coached teenagers, she thinks
that they probably need it.

’’I’d love to coach teenagers,”
she said. ”From what I can tell,
the girls think that the boys are all

after only one thing. And the boys I

think that the girls are all just out
to use them financially. There is
a need for coaching.”

But surely generations of Amer-
icans got along without the as-
sistance of a dating coach.

”Yes, but things aren't right

these days,” Kellams said. ”Peo-.
ple are uncomfortable because‘ a

dating isn't as simple as it should
be. .
”What is a coach, anyway? If
you want to be a better singer,

you go to a voice coach. If you _ ,_
want to be a better actor, you go , .

to an acting coach. The whole
point is to ‘get better at something
that you want to be better at.
”I don't look at this frivolous-
ly. I don't say ’dating coach’ in a
cutesy manner. People tell me
what has happened’ on their
dates, and then I cheer them on.
I want to get out of them the best
that they have to give.” '

Breast reductionchanged her life for the better

Q. From my teen years to age
26, I had large breasts. I had to
order expensive, special bras.
Big, heavy, three-hook jobs. In
school they called me ”Boobs”
and even less flattering things.
Men never saw me, just my
chest. In summer the straps bit
into me and left marks, and I got
rashes under the bra. The weight
of the breasts themselves was un-
comfortable. At last I went to a
plastic surgeon and eventually
had a reduction procedure. I be-
came a 368, and for the first time
in years I looked down and saw
my feet. And my life did improve.
I think the advice you gave the
woman who was considering

breast reduction was all wrong."

A. What you say is persuasive,
and I have heard many other ac-
counts like yours since that ques-
tion was answered in this
column. I can only agree that
some women's lives have been

improved by such procedures, ‘

but I still think that both men and
women should think long and
hard and get the best advice
available before altering their
bodies by surgery. ..

' A lot of people have asked me
the question, ”What is your
favorite season?” They're not
really curious about what my
favorite season is, though. (I don't
have one.) They only want to
hear me say ”summer,” ”spring”
or ”autumn.” Thus they feel com-
fortable knowing they aren’t the
only ones who hate winter. ,

At first glance, winter doesn't
seem to offer much compared to

the warmth and color of the other -

seasons. Spring and autumn have
their comfortable temperatures
and the multitudes of nature's
foliage colors. Summer,_ mean-
while, is analogous to fun, with
weekends and vacations spent at
warm beaches, swimming pools
and amusement parks. Winter,
with its gray skies and leafless
trees, may seem like a depressant

in comparison. Old‘Man Winter's, , ,

Especially, they should get a
realistic picture of what plastic
surgery will do for them. People
have had unrealistic expectations
and then sufferred bitter disap-
pointment.

Psychological counseling
seems required to help people
adjust to what they see after .the
procedure, because it is not

necessarily what they visualized .

beforehand.‘ It seems that we

have to learn to like the way we a

look, whether it is,art or nature
that made us that way. That be-
ing so, I think that, except in ex-
treme cases, we might as well
omit the surgery and learn to like
or live with what we have in the
way of eyes, ears, nose, breasts,
etc., because the self-image is

almost entirely a matter of subjec- '

tive perception and fine psycho-
logical adjustment.

' A very beautiful person, by
which I mean someone that
everyone considers beautiful, has
to learn to live with that, wonder-
ing, ”Do I really exist, or am I just

attention they get, as if they are
ashamed of looking that way.
Such beauties could do with
counseling to learn to accept the
attention as something friendly or
at least not harmful.

Onlookers feel relieved to be
more ordinary—looking — and
grateful that aging is less alarm-
ing to them. To be that handsome
can be as painful, it seems, as to

to have a big sense of something

Q. Please settle an argument
between me and my" father. I am
I I and into exercise, and I over-
did it, and my legs were aching.
I wanted Mom to massage them,
but she was asleep, so I bribed
my brother, who is 73, to do it.
Dad said for him not to because
‘it was wrong for a brother to do
that to his sister. I only wanted it
because my legs ached, and my
brother only agreed for the bribe.
Wasl wrong?

A. Tell your father that it shows
how innocent you and your
brother were that you had to
‘bribe him. That's how little he
was interested‘. And you were to-

- tally innocent and just wanted to

nippingatyournose  and all

fingers, and fewer hours of sun-

light make our world seem a bit \

nocturnal and dreary. Who can
look forward to the months of
bleakness?

I don't have a favorite season
becausel try to find something
enjoyable in each one. With win-
ter you just have to look a bit
harder to find that particular ad-
mirable aspect.

One obvious aspect that easily
comes to mind is Christmas.

Perhaps it was intentional that
our ancestors decidedto hold
Christmas during the bleakness of
winter. They probably meant the
holiday to be an emotional pep
rally. During the bitter cold
months, we keep warm in the

. love and giving weexperience '

around the family Christmas tree.
And the long winter nights sud-
denly.don’t seem so empty when

‘the melodies of ”Silent Night”

  MA'l"l'
1'0I.BER'I'

and ”Jingle Bells” drift with the
wind-blown snow.

I always thought the winter sea-
son brought people closer
together. During the rwarmer
months, my brother and I were so
busy running around outside do-
ing boyish deeds that we didn’_t
seem to spend as much time in-
doors with each other or the fam-
ily. But duringthe cold "months,
we were stuck at home with
Mom in the kitchen making hot
cocoa or with Dad listening to the
stereo in the family room or just
with_each other playing board
games in our bedroom. The
freezing winter winds had driven

us inside our suburban house
where the confinement of limit-
ed rooms kept us close together
and forced us to come up with‘
mutual indoor activities to
replace the football and bike
rides that had chased away our
‘after-school and after-wo_rk bore-
dom. It was the best imprison-
ment I ever faced.

And doesn't winter seem to
make us feel more alive, more
aware of our surroundings? With
the snapping cold freezing our
fingers and blowing in our faces,
how could we not be conscious
of our bodies and our environ-
ment? Even the bleakness of win-
ter's grays, whites and blacks, like
a black and white movie, seems
to replace warm weather's hazi-
ness with cold weather's crystal
icicle clarity; our eyes are less
saturated by nature's blurring
color combinations and are more

And it makes you mad to have _ W

anyone think ”Yuck!”.
But your father thought you
both were getting too old for that.

First you got too big to take baths .

together, now you're too big to
rub each other. And he forbade
it — because, after all, he has to
look after you both and stop you
from doing some things even if
they only look wrong. Just think
of it as one more thing a growing
person has to-absorb.

I remember vé'ry well being
misunderstood by grownups. It's
infuriating! And they just won't
listen and understand or believe
you. Tell your father you don't

‘ mind being corrected or. in—'-

formed, but you hate being mis-
understood. Grownups _forget

how that used to feel when they .

were young. ,

I can't say your father was
wrong. Maybe _he might have
said, ’’I know you meant no
harm,” because your intentions
were innocent. And now please
drop the whole thing. Next time,
if Mom is asleep, soak the legs in
a hot bath.

We can find other aspects of
winter that make us look forward

get ourselves worked up over
how depressing the upcoming
months will be. We would be

been $12 and $4 for full- and
part-time students, respectively,
since its inception in 1966.

Dr. Conney Kimbo, vice presi-
dent for student affairs, said he
spoke with Moyer yesterday

regarding a fee increase. He said .

Moyer has followed the correct
procedure by proposing the in-
crease through the board.

Subsequent steps include con-
sultation with Joyce Giangarlo,
acting co—director of student ac-
tivities,'and presentation to Kim-
bo and the university president
Wesley Posvar. The ultimate de-
cision, Kimbo said, is made by
the student affairs committee of
the board of trustees.

”The referendum is not re-
quired,” Kimbo said, ”but it

would be helpful.” .

Moyer, who defeated Jay Roth-
stein in the elections three weeks
ago, has already delegated board
member-elect Therese McFadden
to research the topic. He said he
hopes to have a proposal-when
he takes office in January.

’’I want to kick off my term
with that proposal,” Moyer said.
”That’s one of the things l want
brought to my first board
meeting.”

Moyer said one consideration
which may determine how much
to increase the fee is the Student
Publications Board, which over-
sees The Pitt News.

The Media and Publications
Board benefitted from the 1980
increase, which raised its subsi-
dy from $35,000 to $82,500, ac-

cording to the Dec. 7, 1979 issue
of The Pitt News. The Student
Publications Board and WPTS—
FM received approximately
$80,000 this year, said Wilfred
Tremblay, assistant director of
student activities for media

Thepublications board 15 con-
sidering a proposal to make The
Pitt News self-sufficient, Trem-
blay said. After three years, The
Pitt News would no longer re-
quire its $30,000 allocation from
the 5GB. Advertising revenues
would enable the newspaper to
meet its $310,000 annual oper-
ating budget.

Tremblay said that according to
the proposal, the $30,000 even-
tually would be returned to the
SGB for reallocation elsewhere.

stop this trend is to make people

Students who enter theirnames
in the survey will have their ad-
dresses crossmatched with ad-
dresses of other students. The
service is free of charge, and
there is no obligation.

”There is a big savings to be
had,” Miller said. ’’It definitely
does save money.” r

The price to carpool could
vary, depending on how many
people are in the carpool and
how far it travels.

’’It could cost $10 a week, or
it could cost $10 a, month,”
Miller said. -

lnitial reactions from the stu-
dent body were mixed.

Mark Smith, a 20-year-old
sophomore, commuted from
Penn Hills last year, butthis year
he lives in an apartment in Squir-
rel Hill. He said the main reason
he moved closer to the Pitt cam-
pus was because of the transpor-
tation problems he had. Last year,
Smith rode a Port Authoritybus
into Oakland daily. This year he
walks.

’’I definitely would have taken ,

part in carpooling,” Smith said.
’’I tried to do it when I lived in
Penn Hills, but it didn't work out.
The bus service stinks.”

Jeanne Prisbylla, a 21-year-old
senior, had the same problem
when she commuted from Bethel
Park two years ago, but now she
lives in Highland Park and rides
the bus. '

’’I hated the bus when l lived
in Bethel Park,” Prisbylla said,
”but it is more convenient for me
now. There is a bus that leaves for
where I live every 15 minutes. lt’s
hard to find someone to carpool
with that has the same schedule
as you have, and parking and
traffic are a hassle.”

Miller-said she does not expect
the student ridesharing attempt to
be an immediate success. She
said, however, ’’I think we will

have a reasonable amount of stu-

dents to carpool.”

Miller and Milani both said
they hoped to have the rideshar-
ing system organized and operat-
ing by the winter term which
begins_Jan. 6. ‘

Lee McRae continues to break records, as he eclipsed one mark and tied another at Monday
night's Blue-Gold meet at Fitzgerald Field House. ‘

Evans pleased with

By John Enright

I Sports Editor

The Pitt Panther basketball
team opens the season Saturday
night against Indiana (Pa.) at Fitz-
gerald Field House. As the team
gets ready forhthe upcoming sea-
son, the biggest problem facing
the Panthers is lack of depth, as
there ‘are only nine scholarship
players on the squad.

Proposition 48Itook-away the
services of three of Pitt's recruits

for this year. In fact, two of those-

players, Herb Barthol and John
McNeil, chose to go to school
elsewhere, while Chris Gatling, a

’6-8‘/2 forward from Elizabeth,

N.J., is enrolled in classes but has
to sit out the season.‘

Also, another recruit, point
guard Jimmy Rodgers, failed to
graduate from his juniorcollege

.in'C.eorgia and never made it to
-Pitt.   . - -

 

But while the Panthers can go
only seven or eight players deep
this year, a lack of depth will not
be such a problem next season,
as Pitt signed four highly regard-
ed high school players during the
NCAA’s early signing period
which ended last Wednesday.

The four players are Brian
Shorter, Jason Matthews, Sean
Miller and Darelle Porter.

Shorter, a 6-7 forward from
Oak-Hill Academy in Mouth of
Wilson, Va., is considered one of

the top 10 high school players in V

the country. ’’He’s a man out
there,” said Pitt coach Paul
Evans.‘ ”The first time I saw him

play, I thought he was 25 years

old.” . -

Earl Duncan; one of the nation's
top point guard prospects. Dun-
can is currently enrolled at
Syracuse.

Despite the credentials of
Shorter and Matthews, Pitt's two
most important recruits may be
6-1 Sean Miller from Blackhawk
High School in Beaver Falls, and
6-4 Darelle Porter from Perry
High,School in Pittsburgh.

In Evans’ first year at the helm
of the Panther basketball p_ro-
gram, he has already established
a local recruiting base, something
that was lacking in recent years.
”It’s important to get local kids
because it draws interest into the
program,” said Evans.

Also, Miller and Porter are very
good players. Miller, a point

WEDNESDAY, NOVEMBER 26, I986

By Greg Sysyn

Sta ff Writer

Records are made to be bro-
ken. Well  there was some vinyl
crashing at the Fitzgerald Field
House last Monday night at the
annual Blue—CoId intrasquad
meet.

The meet started off with a
bang, literally. Bob Weiner, a

member of the AIl—America, two-r,

mile indoor relay team,I took
almost three seconds off of the
previous meet record in the
1-mile race with a time of4:13.6.
”l was just concentratingon the
first lap,” said Weiner. ’’l have a
tendency to start out slow. This
time I went out a little faster.”
Weiner established the norm
for the Blue team as they went on
to victory. But the Gold team had
its moments also, thanks to junior
Lee McRae. I
McRae — who is (if you have

s not heard by.now) All-East, All-

American, AIl—World, All-
Everything — also managed to
put on his own little show.
McRae tied his own meet record

. in the 50-yard dash and shattered’
the Fitzgerald Field House record

of 31 seconds in the 300—yard run
with his time of 30.5. McRae was
slightly surprised with his per-
formance.

’’I went out harder than I want-
ed to because of Lars [HummeI],”
said McRae. ”He is a fine runner.
In the last 10 meters, I was look-
ing back to see where he was. It
also was the first time this year
thatl ran the 300 yards. I had no
idea of what I could do. I feel real
good about my performance.”
McRae also won the 50-yard

dash with a time of 5.1 seconds.-

In case you follow Pitt track
and are beginning to wonder
who this Lars Hummel is, he is a
member of the Danish Olympic
Team. He transferred to Pitt and

Pitt basketball

guard, led Blackhawk to the
WPIAL Class AAA championship
last year, averaging 19 points and
nine assists per game. Street &
Smith’s lists him as a high
honorable mention All-America
selection. '

Meanwhile, Porter is a two-
sport star. This fall he was a wide
receiver on Perry's City League
Championship football team,

I catching 43 passes, 15 of whic

went for touchdowns. '

As a basketball player, Porter is
even better. Basketball Times lists
him as the 12th best tvvo-guard in
the country. Last season, Porter
averaged 14 points, seven re-
bounds and seven assists per
game, leading Perry to the City
League Championship.

Overall, Evans was very
pleased with his group of early
signees. ”We got some pretty
good players,” said Evans. ”With
Shorter, we got a power player in-

must sit out a year before compet-
i-ng for the Panthers. Next year he
can practice with the team and
compete on his own.

The Gold team made a run at
the Blue in the distance events
and relays, but it proved to be too
little, too late. However, in the
last event, the 4x880-meter relay,
the Gold team shone like its
namesake. ,

The Gold relay team, consist-
ing of Dave Moore, Thomas Bog-

gan, Joe Turner and Waddie’ ‘ I

Freeman, (Moore, Turner and
Boggan finished 2-3-4, respective-
ly in the 880—meter.) established
a new meet record with a time of
7:45.0 in the final event.
Performing well for the Pan-
thers were Eric Cannon,‘ an All-
America performer in the" hur-

dles, who won the 50-yard'h.ur--

dle race and placed third in the
50-yard dash behind McRae and
Hummel. Freshman Paul
Friedrich continued hisstring of
fine outing with his first-place fin-

ish in the 2-mile run, edging out.‘

Big East steeplechase champion
Joel Ninos.

Debbie Bonner was all over the I

place for the Lady Panthers. She

finished first in the 50-yard hur- "

dles and the 300—yard run and
third in the 50-yard dash.

With all these bright spots, one
would think that Panther track

coach John Vasvary wouldbe _

happy with the performances,
and he is.
”We are real pleased,” said

Vasvary. ”We had some good-

performances. Everybody com-
peted well. When you get in-
trasquad separations, you get the
in-house rivalries. The big thing
now is for the team to remember

that the next meet, we are work— _
ing together instead of competing A

against each other.”

spot which Curtis Aiken will be
vacating. 1 ‘

More importantly, three of the
four recruits, Miller, Porter and
Matthews, scored above the 700
minimum on the SAT and each
one has at least a 2.5 QPA, ac-

cording to Evans. Therefore, all

three will be eligible next year,
barring any disasters in the
classrooms. -‘ -

Meanwhile, Shorter, who trans-

ferred to Oak Hill this summer 1

from Simon Gratz High School in
Philadelphia to improve his
grades, still has to take the SAT.

According to Evans, he is doing

well in his "classes.

Evans said that he wants to
bring in a total of six players next
year, so he still hopes to sign tw
players in April.

Sports Editor

After six weeks of grueling
practices, ‘three intrasquad
scrimmages and two exhibi-
tion games, the Pitt Panther
basketball season is ready to
o. -
g Saturday night at Fitzgerald
Field House, the ninth-ranked
Panthers open their season
with a game against the Indi-
ana (Pa.) Big Indians at 8.
Pitt first-year coach Paul
Evans feels optimistic about
his team despite their lack of
depth. ”I feel fairly good,” said
Evans. ”The kids are in good
shape. In each game we've
played, whether it was an in-
trasquad game or an exhibi-
tion, we've improved. If we
stay healthy, we're a pretty
good baIIcIub.”
That does not mean, how-

ever, that Evans is oblivious to
his team's weaknesses. ”I’m
still concerned with our depth,
defensive play and rebound-
ing,” said Evans. ”We’re going
to have problems in those
areas.”

The most noticeable weak-
ness, as everyone knows, is
the lack of depth. For the most
part, Pitt will go with a seven-
player rotation this season.
Senior captain Curtis Aiken
and sophomore Mike Good-
son will start at the guards,
sophomore Jerome Lane and
junior Demetreus Gore at the
forwards and junior All-
America candidate Charles
Smith at center.

Senior center Tico Cooper
and freshman forward Rod

Brookin will be the first two "/

and possibly the only 0,
players off the benc. It

that Cooper and Brookin will
play critical roles on this team.

”I’ve been disappointed
with Tico in practice, but he's
played well in the scrim-
mages,” said Evans. "I'm hop-
ing that's his mentality —
being a game player. Rod has
missed a lot of time with inju-
ries,_ but the last 10 days he's
improved.”

Because of Pitt's lack of
depth, Evans has had the play-
ers doing a lot of running in
practice so they can build up
their endurance. The situation
with the Panthers is similar to
that of St. John's last season
when e Redmen had virtual-
ly o bench? Quite simply,
layers such as Gore, Aiken,
Smith and Lane will have to
play 30, 35 or maybe even 40
minutes a game.

Of course, these problems
seem minimal compared to
what Indiana coach Tom Beck
will have to deal with Satur- _
day. His club opened its sea-
son with a 94-88 loss to West
Virginia Wesleyan on Mon-
day. Against the Panthers, that
six—point margin will probably
be mulitplied sixfold.

So what does Indiana get
out of playing a Big East
school such as Pitt? ”It helps
us in recruiting and in lal
monetary way,” said Beck.
(Pitt pays Indiana to play here.)
”Plus, it's good public rela-
tions for our university.”

Saturday night at Fitzgerald
Field House, Beck, despite his

 

good about what the Panthers
are going to do to his Indians. ,

THE PITT NEWS, Wedn

Staff Writer

If you think the Pitt wrestling
team is good now, just wait
around for a couple of weeks.

That was the challenge that the
Pitt team offered to the rest of the
Eastern Wrestling League last

weekend at the Ohio |nvitation— A

al, which was held in Dayton.

Gary Bolin expects to return to
the Pitt lineup in a couple of
weeks at 150 pounds for the
Penn State Invitational on Dec.

._»

,'7_.I..i".;5__1 . i""| '1". .'

5-6. ‘

Bolin, who is seen by the Pitt
staff as a top candidate to win a
national championship, is recov-
ering from a badly sprained an-
kle he received in practice prior
to the start of the season.

The Panthers finished fourth
out of 26 teams, behind Michigan
State (1 11 points), the University
of Michigan (96) and Ohio State
University (68). Pitt had 65
points.

Pitt placed three wrestlers in
the top six and narrowly missed

getting a fourth. Leading a long
list of impressive performances
was Pat Santoro ’(10—O this sea-
son), who won the 142-pound
class match while getting two
falls and two technical falls.

In the final, Santoro decisioned

Stacy Richmond of Michigan.

State 18-6.

Santoro and Bolin are viewed
as terrors in the middle of the
lineup at the 142- and 150-pound
classifications, respectively. ”Pat
is ranked third in the nation, and
Bolin could win the national
championship,” according . to

Pitt sophomore Pat Santoro has been successful in the‘early going for the Panthers.

Don't just sit there like some jerk who's never written anything in his_life before.
C’mon up to the fourth floor of the student union.

You too, can write for The Pitt News

Amateur Wrestling News, a
recognized authority on college
wrestling.

Santoro was Pitt's only finalist,
but senior and co-captain Eric
Wertz (9-3) fought his way to a
third-place finish in the
167-pound class.

Wertz lost a criteria decision in
the quarterfinals after tying an
Ohio State wrestler 4-4 in regu-

lation. His opponent won the 1

match by virtue of having two
takedowns to Wertz’s one.

Mike Tongel (7-4), Pitt's
177-pound competitor, finished
sixth, winning four matches and
losing three.

Matt Gerhard would have
placed” in the top six in the
126-pound class had it not been
for a broken toe. Gerhard (6-1)
suffered the injury in a 1-0 loss to
the 126-pound champion, Scott
Hinkel of Purdue.

 Wrestling team looks strong in early stages

Gerhard will probably be on

the Panthers‘ injury list for two ‘

weeks. .

Pitt's 134-pounder, Allan Utter
(8-3), also turned in an impressive
performance.

”He was only two points away‘

from placing,” said Hartupee.
The Pitt staff seemed extreme-
ly pleased with the fourth-place

finish against many of the top . 

wrestling squads in the Mideast.
”The guys really wrestled

well,” said Hartupee. ”They real-

ly pushed their opponents." ~
”We have been going on

morning runs every day at 6:30, '
and they made their conditioning 

pay off.” .

The Panthers make their next
appearance at Lock Haven this
weekend for the Mat Town In-
vitational. Pitt’s first home match

will be against Ashland College

on Jan. 17.

On Saturday night in Las Ve-
gas, a boxing legend was born.
Mike Tyson, the gladiator of box-
ing, clad only in black trunks and
shoes, was attempting to become
the youngest heavyweight cham-
pion in history.

In his bout against Trevor Ber-
bick, the World Boxing Council
champion, many felt this was fi-
nally the time of truth for the
young Tyson. Many people felt
the rise to the top of the boxing
world for Tyson was lined with
too many wins over inferior op-
ponents. After Saturday night,
there will have to be a new defi-
nition of the champion in the

boxing world. The 20-year-old,
5-1 0, 21 7—pound Tyson is a very
unique package for a champion.
He has the legs ofa running back
and the upper body of a lineman.

From the beginning of the first
round in Saturday's fight, Tyson
started his all-out attack. The
difference between this attack
and others was the patience that
he showed in waiting to land the
right shot. He did not have to
wait long —- he threw 106
punches and landed nearly 60
percent of them. He landed more
punches than Berbick could even
throw.

With this pace, it was only a

would be stopped. Dazed in the
first round, Berbick was knocked

cdown early in the second. After

getting up from the first knock
down, it was clear that the fight
was over.

Berbick was put down one
more time, and the fight was
called at 2:35 into the S€C0!".u

to the head and body led Berbick
to ask, ”Was it the second

he did not make the 1984 Olym-

Tyson: maybe the best heavyweight ever

rounds. His overall record of 28-0‘

is marked with 26 knockouts.
When he has gone the distance
against James Tillis and Mitch
Green, he has shown no signs of
fatigue, but he was winded due
to his lack of patience to wait and

-pick his opponents apart.

With one-third of the heavy-
weight division around his waist,
Tyson will continue in the HBO
unification tournament. In
March, he will fight the winner of
the World Boxing Association
match between current champ
Tim Witherspoon and Tony
Tubbs. Neither of thesefighters
has the defense to withstand the
Tyson attack.

After he gets by the WBA
champ, the next step for total
domination of the heavyweight
division would be to win against
the International Boxing Federa-
tion champion, Michael Spinks.

Spinks, a natural light heavy-
weight, does not have the ability
to hurt Tyson. For that matter, he
does not have the ability to "hurt
an established heavyweight.

If Tyson wins the three belts, he
willbe a household name, just
like Sugar Ray Leonard or Mar-
velous Marvin Hagler. For now,
there are the comparisons with
heavyweights from the '60s and
'70s. ‘ I

It has already been accepted
that Tyson punches as hard as Er-
nie Shavers, long considered to
be the hardest puncher in the his-
tory of the heavyweights. Tyson's
bad intentions in the ring can be
compared to those of Sonny Lis-
ton, who was considered to be a
mean fellow in and out of the
ring.

The style of attackis very simi-

- lar to Floyd Patterson's. In using

the peek-a-boo defense, he can
set himself up to land the power-
ful body shots. He also has a right

uppercut that has replaced the j

right cross of Thomas Hearns-as
the most explosiveand devastat-
ing punch in boxing today.
Probably the easiest way to
describe him is to say he.is a
