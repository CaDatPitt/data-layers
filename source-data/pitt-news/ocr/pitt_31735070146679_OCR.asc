Memorial Day: blending the solemn andthe celebratory

John Manganaro
Assistant News Editor

Kit Watson hails from a long line of
patriots.

Born and raised in Carmichaels,
Pa., Watson and his mother attended
the small town’s Memorial Day pa-
rade every year. They would follow
the parade to the local cemetery and
help clean the veterans’ plots, plant
ﬂowers and display wreaths.

Today Watson lives in Harris-
burg, but his mother is buried in
Pittsburgh’s Monongahela Cemetery,
which straddles the river about 30

As the country prepares to ob-
serve Memorial Day on Monday, Wat-
son says celebrating the holiday is
an important part of any American’s
civic duties. —

“I come from afamily of panic ,”
Watson said. “We‘ve always held Me-
morial Day in high regard, to honor

, all those who sacriﬁced everything

they could. We can‘t forget that dur-
ing the parades and picnics.”
. Watson travels to Pittsburgh ev-
ery May to visit his mother’s grave.
Walking through the iron and
granite gates, Watson and other Me-
morial Day visitors will come upon
the historic Monongahela Cemetery

'Chapel, bedecked in ﬂowers laid

veterans.

“College students could take a les-
son from the Boy Scouts,” Watson
said. “We‘ve got an aging veteran
population in western Pennsylva-
nia. We need help carrying ‘on these
traditions. Memorial Day is a perfect
volunteer opportunity.”

Watson has been a member of

the American Legion for 32 years,‘

holding multiple positions at district,
county, department and national
levels. '

He joined the U.S. Air Force as a
young man and was called to active
duty’ during the Vietnam era, work-
ing as a flight control technician on
B-52 and KC-135 aircrafts. He retired

He now works as a department
adjutant in the Legion’s Pennsylvania
oﬂice. He described the way many
veterans feel about Memorial Day,
which he said is more of a solemn
holiday than many realize.

“When you really think about
what they’ve given this country,
you canft help but feel inspired and
blessed,” Watson said. .

Students interested in volunteer-
ingor participatingin Memorial Day
activities don’t have to travel all the
way to the South Hills.

Dean 4 1

In addition to developing and
teaching the Introduction to Mac-
roeconomics program for the Hon-
ors College, Husted served on the
advisory board, supervising stu-
dents in the Bachelor of Philosophy

until his death. -

Husted, as interim clean, is the
second to hold that post in the his-
tory of the University.

  
 
  
 
 

 ‘ SERVICE INDUSTRY NIGHT

New recording policyat Pitt

Michael Macagnone
Assistant News Editor

Permission slips are required for
many educational activities: ﬁeld
trips, skipping gym, going to the’
nurse, arriving late and now, re-
cording a class at Pitt.

The University’s Faculty As-
sembly, which represents all fac-
ulty at Pitt’s main campus and
regional campuses, passed a reso-
lution May 4 that put a statement
on all faculty syllabuses saying
that students need permission
from their instructor before re-
cording in the classroom. P

The assembly, which is affili-
ated with the University Senate,
changed the policy after an inci-
dent involving a student posting
video of a class on YouTube, along
with commentary on the instruc-
tor, classes and the University,
said University Senate President
Michael R. Pinsky. '

The measure, which Dr. Pinsky
described as a “restatement of the
existing policy of the University,”
requires students to get written
permission from a professor be-

fore recording in classes.

Pinsky said that recording
without permission from this
point on would be considered
creating a “hostile learning en-
vironment” in the classroom.

The University’s faculty hand-
book mentions “creating a hostile
work or learning environment”
as part of its anti-harassment
policy. .

The assembly, Pinsky said, act-
ed to protect the “sanctity of the
classroom” in making students
get written permission from fac-
ulty to record in classes.

To allow students to record
“just because they want to is quite
dangerous” to the classroom, Pin-
sky said.

“Learning can be too easily
bruised or damaged,” he said.

Pinsky said that some faculty
were concerned that recording in
classrooms would affect the class
discussion, as students might cen-
sor themselves if they knew they
were being recorded.

Leslie Cody, a second-year
audiology graduate student, said
that when she knew classes were
being recorded, she felt reluc-

tant to interrupt the lecture with
a question.

Seminar classes were an even
stronger deterrent for Cody.

“If there’s more debate about
controversial issues people might
censor themselves,” Cody said.

Kate Onorato is a student at the
University of Pennsylvania but is
taking several summer courses
at Pitt.

Onorato said that biology
classes at the University of Penn-
sylvania have recordings posted
online.

“If I don’t go to class, it helps,”
she said. “We’ll listen to it and
take notes off of the recording.”

The University of Pennsylvania
has a series of recordings on its

website, including some from vis— —

iting lecturers on its campus.

Some Pitt professors thought
that using recording devices hin-
dered the classroom, Pinsky said.
They expressed concerns that stu-
dents might rely on the record-
ings and not participate in class
or ask questions about topics that
they do not understand.

studying civil engineering,

thought that the measure might
have been an overreaction on
the University’s part to a single
incident.

“People mock professors all
the time,” she said. “There’s
ratemyprofessor.com that a lot
of professors aren’t happy about.
This time it just happened to be
on video.” ‘

Although the Assembly passed
the measure, it will be up to indi-
vidual professors to enforce the
policy, Pinsky said.

Pinsky teaches Critical Care
Medicine in Pitt’s School of Med-
icine and said that he does not
generally have a problem with
recording.

Pinsky said that sometimes in
the past he has invited patients to
come to lectures and share their
experiences of dealing with dis-
ease, but has explicitly forbidden
recording in those classes.

In all health sciences classes,
Pinsky said that there are privacy
issues relating to the Health In-
surance Portability and Account-
ability Act of 1996.

When everything causes cancer

Cell phones, smoking, drinking, tanning, breathing, shower
curtains. Supposedly just about everything causes cancer
nowadays, but what are you willing to give up?

The Los Angeles Times reported on a recent study of
430 indoor tanners which-showed that the threat of skin
cancer did not deter people from “fake baking.” Indoor
tanning remains especially popular among youth, with 10
percent of users under 15 years old and 25 to 40 percent
older adolescent females. .

Although cancer threats do not deter tanners, what did‘
dissuade them was the threat of looking bad.

Instead of focusing on the skin cancer risks of tanning,
researchers provided information on the premature skin
aging effects of ultraviolet radiation and on alternative ways
to look good without tanning, such as exercise and sunless

tanning products. Because most people tan to enhance
their appearance, using an image—focused intervention
seems promising. I

In a society as vain as ours, it isn’t surprising that people
would only respond to threats to their appearance and not
to their health. V

And it’s likely that because we hear the cancer threat so
often, we’re simply no longer worried about it. If it seems
like cancer is inevitable, why. bother to quit other things
like smoking? Unless, that is, you’re worried about the
appearance of your teeth. ,

It seems important to note that all of the participants in
the study were young women. Appearance—focused inter-
ventions might not be as eifective on all other age groups
or genders. '

Lexie Bond
Assistant Opinions Editor

Kids like to express themselves nowadays
by becoming fans of things on Facebook.
It’s equally lame as wearing your opinion
on a T—shirt, but unfortunately no one goes
outside anymore.

Therefore, Facebook it is.

I have one took, or friend on Facebook
— I made up the word fook and am going

‘ to continue to unnecessarily mush words

together from now on — who is a fan of
more than 500 pages.

I’m a fan of only three, one of them
being the group “I hate when I’m a mak-
ing a milkshake and boys just show up in
my yard.” ,

You might have seen a Facebook ac-
quaintance —— oh, excuse me, a “fence,”
become of a fan of the page “There should
be a weight limit on leggings and skinny
jeans.” 4

Pictures of the author of definatalie.
com were submitted to the foup (Facebook
group). The blogger responded with a post
titled “You can’t bully me out of my skinny
jeans,” along with a photo of herself in
the jeans with the statement “Just so you
know, I look amazing.”

I admire her confidence, but part of me
is worried, and no, I’m not worried about
the fashion choices of the overweight.

If people want to dress unﬂatteringly
for their figure,'they have that right. I
mean, look at the Olsen twins. My concern
instead is that people are settling and ac-
cepting an unhealthy standard.

I’m not for humiliating people of a cer-
tain size. I’ve been there, and it sucks. ’

Overweight people are human beings
and don’t deserve to be degraded. But
at the same time, the “It’s OK to be fat”
movement has got to end.

It’s not that overweight people can’t be
beautiful. I’m saying they can’t be healthy,
and healthy doesn’t need to be a size 2 or
even a size 8. It just has to be the size you
are when you’re living a balanced, healthy
and active lifestyle.

What makes matters worse is the new
evidence that shows slightly overweight
people might be better off than those with
average weights.

Women’s Health -reports that people
with overweight body mass index (BMI)
scores have a lower risk of mortality, lung
cancer, ‘chronic bronchitis, anemia and
osteoporosis.

The problem with this, besides the fact
that confounding variables could exist, is
that it depends on where the extra weight
lies on the body — something that we
don’t get to choose.

Extra weight on the midsection can be

deadly, while extra weight on the thighs . -

or butt, not so much. Perhaps that’s why
fat-bottomed, not fat-bellied, girls make
the rockin’ world go round.

In «addition, a high BMI score doesn’t
always indicate a high percentage of body
fat. -

BMI doesn’t distinguish between fat
and muscle. For example, most profes-
sional sports athletes would be considered

overweight on a BMI scale. This could’

explain at least some of the reasons people
with a high BMI score appear healthier.

Even if the evidence for high BMI scores
is accurate, it seems being overweight just
allows you to switch from one disease to
another.

That’s because there are diseases that
are deﬁnitely associated with a high per-
centage of body fat, like Type 2 diabetes,
high cholesterol and heart disease. Be-
cause these types of diet-related diseases
are linked to the Western lifestyle, they’ve
picked up the name Western diseases, orl
suppose I’ll have to call them “Weases.”

Thanks to globalization, other coun-
tries around the world are adopting
the Western diet andvlifestyle, which is
spreading the “Weases.” Instead of trying
to combat them, we’ve decided to spread
the ugly rumor that it’s OK to be fat.

Despite the gazillion dollar diet indus-
try, two—thirds of Americans are still over-
weight according to cbsnews.com.

The reasoning is beyond the point of
this column but can simply be associated
with the fact that it is an industry and
looking to proﬁt, not to actually improve
our health.

The fat acceptance movement is Ameri-
ca’s laziness, like usual. Instead of actually
working to solve the obesity epidemic,
we’re looking for reasons we shouldn’t
change, instead of doing the hard thing
and, well, changing.

That’s even lamer than becoming a fan
of more than 500 pages on Facebook.

weekend, touring for the release of

her ﬁfth album, Darling, o/2 Darling.
She formed Miss Tess & The Bon

Ton Parade five years ago when she.
. moved from Baltimore to Boston.

Miss Tess is still an independent art-
ist with no afliliated record label.

“You have to do everything your-
self. It’s a lot ofwork. It’s also cool to
be in control of your own music,” she
said. “It’s a sort of freedom.”

The jazz elements of Darling, ob
Daringshow in subtle ways, with the
inﬂuence 0 ‘‘old jazz Ella Fitzgerald
and Sarah Vaughan” coming from
Miss Tess’s voice. Idols of the past
ﬁnd a place in her music.

“I grew up listening to [jazz sing-
ers] with my parents. Then there’s
Bonnie Raitt, Randy Newman, Tom
Waits. I listened to punk bands in
high school and old country. My in-
ﬂuences are all over the map, but I
think most of them are not alive,”

Miss Tess said.

Her lyrical themes remain rel-
evant, just as those of her inﬂu-
ences, choosing subjects close to

the heart.

“We’re a good date band. People
cuddle up a little bit,” Miss Tess
said. . »

Romance features heavily in this
album, with songs of love lost and
won expressed with the emotion only
a jazz singer can evoke with just the
timbre of hervoice but also with her
personal lyrics.

“We play a lot for singer-song-
writer crowd because I write all the
songs,” Miss Tess said.

The lyrics should ringtrue to any-
one in love or out of it, but for Miss
Tess, tl1ey’ve stemmed from events in
her own romantic past, she said.

“They’re inspired by real rela-
tionships, for the most part. The
title track, ‘Darling, oh Darling’ was
a song I wrote about someone, for
someone. It was very speciﬁc to our
situation,” she said.

The music style sounds differ-
ent with each track, sometimes like

jazz, other times like folk or coun— -

try. Pigeonholing Miss Tess 8: The

Bon Ton Parade becomes an almost
impossible task. Songs like “Love”
withits guitar and the lesser used
clarinet or “Awake” with banjo and
saxophone just don’t ﬁt as anything
but “Miss Tess.”

“We’ve played at all jazz clubs,
dive bars andin the South —— where

theyhadneverheardofliveclarinet,”
shesaid. _ .— V «~

Miss Tess and her quartet will
play dance music at Brillobox this
Saturday, she said. She says her music
is easy for most people to relate to.

“Our jazz is pretty accessible.
Even if they’re not jazz fans, I think

’ people appreciate it and get it,” she

said.

CONCERT PREVIEW

of Montreal brings
new tracks to
Pittsburgh Friday

Kelsey Shea
 ~ M A£rEEditor

of Montreal will make a stop at

.Pittsburgh’s Ches—A-Rena on

Friday.

The band has made a name for
itself over the last decade, play-
ingjaunty indie pop, and is cur-
rently recording its new album,
False Priest. The Pitt News caught

‘up with bass player Davey Pierce

for a phone interview during the
band’s tour before they come to
Pittsburgh this weekend.

Can you tell us a bit about the
new album, False Priest?

“So as far as the live band goes,
we don’t really do much in the
records anymore. They’re Kevin
[Barnes]’s thing. But [we provide]
support, I guess. Right now he’s
mixing it with John Bryan,-and
what I’ve heard of it is fantastic.
It sounds amazing. It sounds so
pro and huge. It’s pretty much go-

- -ingto“be like a next level kind of

thing for us.”

Are you performing any of those
songs live right now on tour?

“We’re playing two songs right

_ now on the tour —— a song called

‘Coquet Coquette,’ which we actu-
ally just shot a video for, and then
a song called ‘Famine Affair?” ‘

Can you tell us a bit about your

new side project, Yip Deceiv- -

er?

“It’s kind of half electronic dance
rock stuff, just good time kind of
dance music. It’s kind of inspired
a lot by Top 40 rap nowadays, like

I’m really into hip-hop now. Actu- _'

ally not hip—hop per se, just rap.”

So since you’re actually from
Georgia, where did the name
of Montreal come from?

“You know there’s so many stories
going around right now, mainly I
think because we just got tired of
telling the real one. Basically it had
something to do with a girl Kevin
was dating a long time ago, and
he needed a name for the band.

She’s from Montreal, so there you"  ‘ ‘

go. That’s the boring one that’s
actually true. But we tell people it
was a traveling sex cult, and that
it was some kind of commune we
were living on.”

‘ How’s the tour going?

“The tour’s going very well right
now. Tonight’s going to be fourth
show of the tour. We did New Or-
leans, Austin and Dallas last night.
They all went really, really well,
like surprisingly well since we
just didn’t know what to expect
 We’re actually doing more the-
atrics on it than we have on other
tours, and the production of it is
pretty over the top as far as that
goes. But people have been react-
ing really, really [well.]”

Natural can be
healthy and tast

Good choices don’t always mean garden burgers

Jordan Streussnig
Staff Writer

Eating healthy is a drag. When all of your
friends decide to order pizza one night,
the last things you want to think about are
calories and saturated fat content.

I mean, really, who wants to swap a nice,
juicy burger for a hunk of reconstituted
veggies taking on a patty shape, without
bun and condiments? Not me, and I’m
guessing not most of you, either.

But before you completely lose hope
and decide it’s not even worth it to try,
before you resign yourself to a life ﬁlled
with preservatives, artiﬁcial ﬂavorings and
a general lack of knowledge as to what the
heck you are putting into your body, take
heart — you can do what’s right for your
body while keeping your tongue and tummy
satisﬁed.

One of the keys to eating well when
you’re strapped for information as to the
particular content of a certain snack or
meal is to choose natural.

- The less whatever you are going to eat.
has been tampered with, the better. Instead
of choosing a pack of prepackaged peanut
butter-ﬁlled crackers, buy some natural
peanut butter and whole grain crackers,
and make them yourself.

The more inﬂuence you have over
making the food you consume, the more
in control you are of what makes it into
yourbody. . . T  --  '

As college students, however, the sad
truth is that most of us don’t always have
the time to be so diligent with what we
are eating.

If a prepackaged meal is what you re-
quire, you can still make simple choices at
the grocery store to stay slim, healthy and
in charge of what you eat.

Take bread for example. Do a quick scan
of the nutrition label on your loaf before
purchasing, and you are already on your
way to a better diet.

Ditch brands that contain more sugar
than they do ﬁber, and make sure to take
note of the ingredients list. Generally
speaking, the shorter the list, the more
natural the product.

Big fan of Kraft mac? Annie’s brand
is a better choice and can be found near
the Kraft at most grocery stores. It’s a tad
pricier, but the few cents is worth it. An-
nie’s mac and cheese contains 72 percent
less fat than Kraft Organic, not to mention

- oil-saturated candy bars on the market”

 
  
   
  
   
 
  
  

Have you recently iweii diagnosecl
with insomnia or sleep apnez Z’

a list of ingredients that can actually be
pronounced. , I T" _
According to “Eat This, Not,Tha ” by ‘
David Zinczenko and Matt.Goulding, you
should choose the boxed products with‘ .
ingredients lists that read “like __the_recipe’ ’'

Candies like Hershey’s Take 5 and Nes-
tle Raisinets are some safe choices, with _
Take 5 ditching the nougat for pretzels and V l

However, you might want to steer clear
of Twix Peanut Butter, “one of the fattiest,

fiber, and make sure to

note the ingredient list.”

Juice can be another huge pitfall for gro-
cery shoppers with a limited amount of
time. If you don’t read the label, you could
be purchasing something very different
from what you intended.

“Juice cocktail” is a tipoff that the actual
juice content of the beverage you are pur-
chasing might actually be very small, some-
times on the order of 10 to 20 percent.

What makes up the rest of these so-
called fruit juices? Artiﬁcial colors, sweet-
eners and sugar. Look for juices that say
“1oo percent juice,” such as Mott’s apple
juice line.

Another consideration: Even though
fruit juices are a much better choice than so-
das, beware that the natural sugar content
of fruit, and thus of juice, is very high.

A tip you can- use to decrease sugar
intake while simultaneously stretching
your money is to buy 100 percent juice,
but mix a little water in every time you
pour a glass.

Pitt falls in final  
series of season

Panthers clinch No. 3 seed in tournament

Alex Oltmanns
Sports Editor:

The Pitt baseball team lost at
home to South Florida this week-
end. Then, the Panthers followed
the Bulls back to the beach.
This year’s Big East tourna-
ment is in Tampa Bay in Clear-
water, Fla. The tournament starts
today when the No. 3 seed Pan-
thers take on No. 6 seed Rutgers

at 10 a.m. in the first game. The

team canionly afford two losses
in the double-elimination brack-
et.

Pitt enters the ‘game after
losing two of three games in
the South Florida series. It was
Pitt’s first series loss since the
first week of April when it lost

to Rutgers.

The players know that while
they might have lost a couple of
games in a row, their efforts are
solely focused on postseason play

right now. ,
“Unfortunately, it had to
happen, but it was a humbling
experience,” junior outfielder
John Schultz said. “Going into

the tournament, it did kind of '

serve as a wake-up call.”

It was Schultz’s walk- off two-
run homer in the ninth inning of
the first game against the Bulls
Thursday that gave the Panthers
(37-14, 18-6 Big East) an 8-7 win
and the most conference wins in
school history.

“I’ve never had a walk-off hit
before that,” Schultz said. “To
do that in a situation where we
needed a win, that was one of the
coolest things I’ve ever done.”

» There Weren’t too many high-
lights for Pitt in the second day of
the series against South Florida,
as they dropped a doubleheader
by scores of 7-3 and 14-12 in 10
innings. L

SOFTBALL

Panthers look to improveoffense next year

Lauren Kirschman
Senior Staff Writer

As the Panthers entered this soft-
ball season, one of the biggest
holes for the Pitt softball team
was at catcher.’
Graduate Sam Card was absent
from behind the plate after batting
@277 the previous season and lead-
ing the team with 28 RBIs. She hit
three home runs during her senior
season to ﬁnish second on Pitt’s
all-time home run list with 29 long
balls.
3” Before the season began, head
lieved freshman Holly Stevens had
the capability to step into that role
both offensively and defensively.
Stevens, a catcher from San Pedro,

£9‘

‘coach Holly Aprile said she be-‘

Calif., did justthat. _ . _

Stevens ﬁnished the season
third on the team in batting av-
erage, hitting .280. She tied with
Yvette Bravo to lead the Panthers
with 30 RBIs and set Pitt’s rookie
home run record with ten. Stevens
also took over third place on the
single-season home run list.

She was sixth in the Big East in
home runs this season.

After Pitt’s victory over Syra-
cuse on May 1, Aprile said that
Stevens’ poise was impressive,
particularly for a freshman.

“She calls the games, she’s de-
veloped a good relationship with
the pitchers,” Aprile said. “She’s
very steady, not a lot gets to her,
and that’s helpful, especially of-
fensively.”

Aprile said that even when Ste-
vens struggles, she’s always able

to bounce back quickly, and that

works to her beneﬁt both offen-
sively and defensively.

' With Stevens stepping up be-
hind the plate, the Panthers ﬁn-
ished their season with a 27-25
overall record. , V

Pitt ended its season with a 9-1

-loss to Louisville in the Big East

Championship quarterﬁnals on
May 13 after earning the sixth seed
in the tournament, the Panthers
highest-seeding ever, and compet-
ing in the Big East tournament for
the fourth time in ﬁve years.

Junior pitcher Cory Berliner re-
ceived herﬁrst All-Big East honor
when she was named to the All-
Big East third team following the
regular season. Berliner ﬁnished
the year leading the Panthers in
ERA (2.06) and innings pitched
(166.1).

Alyssa O’Connell pitched effec-

tively, throwing 165 innings with
an ERA of 2.16. ,

Berliner and O’Connell were
fourth and ﬁfth in the conference
in ERA, respectively. Throughout
the season, Aprile commented
that pitching and defense were the
strongest areas for her team.

The Panthers were third in the
conference in ﬁelding percentage
(9.67) and second in ERA (2.19).

However, much like last season,
Pitt tended to struggle from the
plate. The Panthers ﬁnished 12“‘
in the conference with a combined
batting average of .232.

Ashley Amistade led the Pan-
thers in batting, with an average
of .320, making her the only Pitt
player to ﬁnish the seavvson with
a batting average above .300.

Bravo hit 15 doubles this sea-

‘son, which places her second in

that category in the single-season
record books. She also recorded
a nine-game hitting streak early
in the year.

On May 17, Aprile signed two
recruits for the class of 2011: in-
ﬁelder Courtney Derus and pitcher
Karlynjones. ‘

Derus, who hails from Bloom-
ﬁeld, Colo., was a four—year start-
er at her high school where she
received all-conference honors
twice. For the past three seasons
sheplayed shortstop.

A Sparks, Nev., native, Jones
racked up a .67 ERA and 148 strike-
outs in 94 innings. She helps her
own cause at the plate, too, batting
.479 with 32 RBIs.

Needless to say, things are look-
ing good for the Panthers heading
into the 2011 season.

ued his hot hitting with his second homer
of the series, but it wasn’t enough to dig
the Panthers out of a 7-0 hole.

In game two, "Pitt quickly fell behind
again 6-0 but some timely hitting, led by
two David Chester homeruns, brought
them back and put them ahead 11-9 enter-
ing the ninth inning.

'But the Panthers couldn’t hold the lead,
dropping their regular-season ﬁnale and
the ﬁnal game at Trees Field. The Panthers
will move into the new Petersen Sports
Complex nextuseason.

But with that behind them, they still
have a great chance to make some noise
in the Big East tournament, as they have
proven all season that they can play with
some of the best teams in the country.

The postseason brings added pressure,
but the Panthers know they have to treat
their ﬁrst game against the Scarlet Knights
just like any other.

“Nothing really changes,” Schultz said.
“We have Corey Baker on the mound who’s
done a fantastic job for us all year.”

Depending on the outcome of its first

game, Pitt will play Thursday, against ei-
ther the winner or loser of the Connecti-
cut—Cincinnati game.

'Schultz’s play on the ﬁeld speaks for it-

self: He batted .406 with four homeruns
and 48 RBIs this season. He also broke
Pitt’s record for walks in a single season
with 53.

Schultz is making news off the ﬁeld as

- well with his blog dedicated to Pitt base-

ball on pingbaseball.com.

The blog reports on the daily activi-
ties of the team and takes a sometimes
comedic but insightful glance at the team’s
coaches and student-athletes who have
taken part in this record—breaking season
for the Panthers.

“I just wanted everyone that read the
blog to kind of get a feel for what every
day in the life of a college baseball player
was like,” Schultz said. “Just the chemistry
that was going on between our team and
little things that happen that just highlight
the day.” .
