Freshman Women Attend
WAA Bal Mystique Aﬂair

Newest Customs Event .
Centers on Mysterious

‘Question M ark.’ Theme

Tonight’s the night when all good
freshman women will attend the Bal

'- Mystique at the ‘ University club;

Members of WAA, who are spon-
soring the affair, say those attending
“should expect anything and be sur-
prised at nothing.” They’re very
mysterious about the Bal Mystique,
but are certain of one thing--that
everyone will lose _a lot of weight.

Right here in where all men read-
ers should lost interest, for the Bal
Mystique is strictly a feminine affair.

The Bal Mystique is relatively new,
having its start last year. The idea
was taken from the St. Louis annual
Veiled Prophet dance, a c_elebration
which is looked forward to each year.
In former years, the University ﬁrst-
year women were entertained at the
.Coed Prom.

This year’s Veiled Lady will not

reveal her identity.
l Rusty Williams’ orchestra will pro-
lvide music for the affair. Highlight
{of the evening (beside all the mys-
lterious ones) will be a novelty dance
:number by Fred Kelly, headliner of
ithe Cap and Gown show of ’37.

The freshman women will wear
“question-mark corsages” of card-
board, in four diﬁerent colors. Each

color will have a special signiﬁcance.
The Bal Mystique, in charge of
Betty Crovve, Ed40, vice president of

WAA, will take place this eveningl

Present Views

On Alumni Aid.

Alumni Group Favors
Gradual Suspension
Of University Grants

By Lew Riley

A statement made last week by Dr;
John Weber, secretary of the Univer-
sity, indicating that sentiment among
the University board of trustees fa-
vored suspension of ﬁnancial aid to
the General Alumni Association, was
answered Monday by John B. Nick-
las, Jr., ’22, Alumni president.

Speaking for the association, Mr.
Nicklas said, “We are perfectly will-
ing to admit that the alumni asso-
ciation should ultimately be self-sup-A
porting; however, whether this step
can be taken in one year without ser-
ious results to the organization, I
don’t know.”

The exchange of authoritative
opinion tended to draw sharper the
line of misunderstanding between
alumni and administrative forces that
has resulted from the delayed an-
nual appropriation of funds to the
alumni group.

The threatened appropriation cut
brought an urgent call last week for
continued support of the alumni as-
sociation from Mr. . Nicklas in the
face of what he termed a “challenge
to the men and women of Pitt.”

The statements indicate that both
groups agree that University ﬁnan-
cial support must ultimately be de-
nied the General Alumni Association.

The impending conflict between
alumniand administrative groups is
expected to center on the question of
whether this suspension of aid will
be imposed upon the alumni in the
course of one year or by a gradual
reduction in the appropriation.

well .as representatives of other cam=,4;.A1“mni ..S.P°ke5m‘~‘n contend that the

latter course will enable the associa-
tion to adjust its ﬁnances without
necessarily disrupting its activities.

Dr. Leland D. Baldwin
turns to fiction

Based on History of

By Freda Jaffe

Drawing upon the history of West-
ern Pennsylvania, Dr. Leland D.
Baldwin, lecturer in history at the
University, has written a new novel,
“The Delectable Country.”

On the Book of the Month and the
Literary Guild lists, the book is al-
ready on its way to becoming a na-
tional best seller. The novel, to be
published October 11, is a Lee Fur-
man lnc., publication.

In an interview Dr. Baldwin ex-
plained that the story is one of a
lusty frontiersman faced with the
problem of adjusting himself to a
changing economy. For the Whiskey
Rebellion was graphic evidence of the
passing of the frontier and the com-

; ing of a new order.

And it is while the Whiskey Re-
bellion is brewing, in the 1700’s, that
David Bradee pilots his foster father’s
keelboat at the frontier town of Pitts-
burgh. David is the colorful hero

The Publications Get
A New Understanding

’l‘oday’s amiounceincnt of the selection of a llt‘W
Pulilicarions B<)::1i'(l to regiilnte the affairs of the

News, l’am'lier, and Owl may mark the beginning
of a period of sensible uiiderstainliiig between the
staffs of these publications and the lTiiivei'sity fac-
ulty and adininistration.

‘Ne feel tliat. this situation inay be so different
froin the uncertain conditions of the past three
years, when tlicre was no set publications policy,
tlizit an c_x'plaiu1tiioii of how the present understand-
.lll{.’,‘ \V2!H rcaclicd should be of interest.

Last spring, at one of Chancellor Bowinfginis
‘_‘tii-cslde cliats,” leaders ofthe three publications
siiggcsted fl plan siinilar to the one which has been
.‘idopl‘e(l. The new plan represents the ideas of a
group of students and faculty and administration
ineinbers, who conferred several tiiiies with Provost.
Rufus ll. Fitlzgcrnlcl before conipleting the pro-
posal whicli was subinitted to the Chancel.lor and
nccepteil.

l,'3(.‘(.‘.2lllS€‘, the new Publications Board consists of
students and faculty inenibers, in addition to per-
sons on the adniiiiistrative staff, its nieetings should
l'0Sllll in action which will be more in harmony
with the niins of the publications. Most important,
the editors and business iiiaiiagers of the News,
l’nnt.li<+r. élll(l Owl will always be present at Board
lllC(.’l.ll‘l;.1‘.\‘ to present their cases.

'l"he new Board should provide a fairer means
oi’. selection of editors and business inaiiagers than
did the old Publications Board, which was adminis-
Trn‘lion-doiniiiated, or the “one-man” inethod of
selection used during the past year, which put the
fnciilty a(lviser “on the spot" for his clioiccs.

Our n<+w l’nl.)lica't.ions Board should bring about
:1 lietter llll(leI‘StEl,l1cllllg' of the problems of the pub-
liizatimis, particularly among ineinbers of the fac-
ulty and ndniinistration. And for the first time in

“Lilo Begins at 40”
Advocates No \Var

Ainoiig the mail received by the editorial de-
partinent the other day was the siiggestioii for a
cainpaigii from “Killer B. Pitkin, author of “Life
Begiiis at Foi't_v,” “A Short History of Human-
Sti1pid'it_v,” and sundry other books. Mi‘. Pitkin
does not believe in war.

Gist of his idea seems to be that we should col-
lect naines and sell stickers. The iiaines are to be
signed to a Sunnnons, coinnianding the President
to keep us out of war. The st'ickers,designed for
shop windows and car windshields, consist mainly
of the words, “No VV-a.i*.” Both stickers and sinn-
mons were printed at Mt. Pitkin’s expense. _We
are allowed to sell them at a proﬁt. ‘

Mr. Pitkin, having been professor of journa_1'is1n
at (‘olunibia since 1912, should be an expert on
newspaperinen. Perliaps, then, he knows what he
is doing when he stresses the proﬁt angle of his
propositioii.

“Te synipathize with Mr. l’itkii1’s motives- He
doesn’t want the United States to get into a War.
Neither do We. ln fact, oil‘-hand we can ’t think of
2i_n_v good Ainerican who does. Also, it would, in
our opinion, be 21 very good idea to niake the stu-
dent l)OL y more conscious of the need for doing
GV8l'_\'l'lllllg‘ in our power to keep Ainerlca out of
war. _

'We hope, liowcver, tliat Mr. Pitkin will pardon
us if VVG do not go into business over the matter.

social committee.

“Social rules were originally for-
mulated so that the social program of
each organization . . would not in-
terfere with the rights of
(other) groups, of individuals, and of
the University,”

Effective with the opening of the
full term, the revised rules have been
published to t‘amiliarl7.e new organi-
zations and to emphasize the need of
considering convenience in planning
social affairs.

Registration of affairs has been
recognized by the SFA as a particu-
larly troublesome problem, and they
have called attention to the section in
“Social Rules, 1939-1940” pertaining
thereto:

“All dances and other social func-
tions of University student organiza-
tions must be registered at least four
days before the date of the event on
forms provided by the Social Com-
mittee, obtainable in the office of the
dean of women.

“Those organizations which fail to
register four days before the event do
so at their own risk and the Social
Committee assumes no responsibility
for inconveniences incurred thereby,
such as cancellation of the party.”

Letters explaining the importance
of acquaintance with the new social
rules have been sent by the SFA to
the social chairman of all student or-'
gzmizations. Additional copies of the
“S(x:ial Rules, 1939-40" may be pro-
cured in the dean of women’s office.

Roberts announced.

The annual membership drive of
the Engineering Association Cabinet
gets under way this week, according
to Robert Edwards, EE40, president.
The first dance of the fall social pro-
gram is to be held at the Grotto on

Business Index

Shows Advance
In Late M oaths

Although business activity has

gained fast in recent weeks, both in
this district and throughout the na-
tion, the rise from July to August’
was particularly pronounced, accord-
ing to the monthly summary of dis-
trict business conditions published by
the Bureau of Basiness Research of
the University. ‘
_ Gains in employment, man-hours,
and payrolls were reflected strongly
in the Pittsburgh district during Au-
gust, showing a gain of 11.1 per cent
in man-hours worked; the number on
payrolls, however, increased by only
2.2 per cent.

Direct employment data for Sep-
tember are not yet available, but it is
conclusive that employment levels
have risen over those of August.

Marked gains in business activity
during August and September are
shown by statistics, and there were
hopes that recovery might be re-
sumed.

teel mill activity both in the Pitts-
burgh district and elsewhere in the
United States has increased at a rapid
pace since the beginning of Septem-
ber. Since then new orders for all
kinds of iron and steel products have
been received in almost unprecedent-
ed volume. The bulk of the orders so
far has come from domestic users, al-
though some foreign tonnage has been
booked.

Dr. Baldwin

Continued from page one
who faces the opening of a new in-
dustrial era.

In the small town of Pittsburgh
David meets Attorney Brackenridge
who encourages him to strive toward
the new order, to accent the realm of
the mind. “Brackenridge is no mys-
tery, explained the author. He steps
directly from the pages of the his-
tory of the ‘Whiskey Rebellion.”

This novel of adventure set in a
historical background is the first one
Dr. Baldwin has written. The author
refused to grant that ﬁClJlOl’1 is more
interesting _to write than historical
monographs, for he thinks that all»
history is vital.

The background for the novel is
drawn from a decade of study in the
history of this region.

“The Delectable Country,” the title ,
of this latest work, varies for the in— 
dividual, the author said. One char-
acter in the novel maintains he can
ﬁnd it in the realm of the spirit,
Brackenridge stresses the

the most important. In just this way,
David Bradee tries to map out his
delectable country and to find a ve-
hicle to reach it.

Dr. Baldwin has alreac:l.v written
three historical books. “Pittsburgh,
the Story of a City.” “Whiskey Rebels.
the Story of a. Frontier‘ Uprising,”
and “The Keelboat Age on Western
Waters” (the latter now in prepara-
tion).

Born in Fairchan-;3e, the author has
lived in the Tri-State area of which
he writes, as well as in New York
.-ttate.

In 1932 he became librarian of the
Histoi:'ical Society of Western Penn-
sylvania. For the past seven years

European Crisis Interrupts Trip 
Of Darlington Collection Curator.

Was it Confucius who said thatO

the smallest streams lead to the larg-
est rivers‘? Anyway, the saying apt-
ly describes Mrs. Lois Mulkearn’s
trip to Europe early. in August.

Mrs. Mulkearn, curator for the
Darlington Memorial collection at the
University, decided this year to ful-
ﬁll herlifelong ambition and to tour

Europe’s libraries and galleries, se-A

curing on the way certain rare’ doc-
uments concerning thelearly history
of Western Pennsylvania. As did
most Americans who were in Europe
at the time, vMrs. Mulkearn became,-_
mixed up in the war.

After she had toured Holland and
the British Isles, Mrs.
planned to see a little of Paris before
returning to America on the Nor-
mandie, which was scheduled to sail
September 6.

For it was in Paris that Mrs. Mul-
kearn’s troubles began. Unaware of
the impending war, she arrived in
Paris August 25, intending to do some

Mulkearn ‘

sight-seeing. and tried to register at
a hotel. But the hotel managers sent
her‘ to the American embassy, and at
the embassy, after yards of “red
tape” had been unwound and hours
of consultation sat through, she was
advised “to leave-Paris immediate-
ly’.”

She then boarded a train for Cher-
l00UI'g and booked passage on the
British liner Empress of Australia.
At the estimated time of the ship’s
arrival in the Bay of Biscay, Mrs.
Mulkearn, with one hundred others
also ﬂeeing Europe, was waiting in
the rough waters of the Bay in a
lender. For more than two hours
they anxiously bobbed about. for the
liner had failed to appear and it was
feared it has passed up Cherbourg
and continued to America from
Southampton. However, the wait,
though uncomfortable, was not in
vain; for the Empress arrived, took

up its weary passengers, and landed

ithem safely in Quebec.

Panthers to Face Strong
Squad of Mountaineers

VVashington Huskies’ Coach Praises Cassiano
For Accurate Passing in Grid Season Opener

By Alex

Zelenski

Pitt is yict:o1_-ions Panthers, after returning from VVashi11gton, will
be on the spot next Saturday as they will have to prove that their
game with the Huskies was 11ot Won on breaks alone.

The '1'es1.1lt.s of the game with.

Wasliington had many of the so-

-called experts’ ears burning, as this year’s Pitt team looks as of old.
In iniracle fashion, the Panthers completed 12 out of 16 passes to

astound the football world.
whole they showed signs of great‘
strength, but at times were weak on,
their running attack.

“Dandy Dick” Cassiano showed
that he is as good as the advance
press notices claimedihim to be as he
not only ran and blocked, but-helped

give the Huskie fans an exhibition of ‘

passing. Coach Jimmy Phelan, of the
Washington Huskies later said “Cas—
siano is the greatest forward passer
that my Washington team has ever
faced.”

Line Surprises

Ernie Bonelli, the Pitt fullback, re-
peatedly bucked the lines for sub-
stantial gains. Ernie’s blocking was
also one of the outstanding features
on the field, Emil Narick also con-
sistently aided the Panthers with his
accurate forward passes.

The line. which was claimed to_be
the weakest unit of the team, looked
good as it held Washington’s thrusts
in all but the third quarter.

This Saturday at the Pitt Stadium
the West Virginia Mountaineers will
meet Pitt after successfully opening
their season against West Virginia
Wesleyan.

The Mountaineers ran rough-shod
over the Wesleyan team as they ran
up 44 points, and look to be the ﬁnest I
team that the fans in Morgantownl
have seen in many a year.
Mccann New Star

Dr. l\/larshall Glenn, coach of the
Mountaineers, has in Don McCann
what he considers one of the best‘
players to ever put on a West Vir-
ginia suit. Coach Glenn held Mc-
Cann back in last week’s game to
save him as a surprise package for
the Pitt game, but when he did in-
sert lVlcCanri, the surprise package
reeled off two touchdowns, one on a
40 yard run.

The lVIc-urltaineers, pointing for
their annual fracas with "the Pitt
Panthers, are in tip-top shape. The
Panthers on the other hand have not
had the rest due them because of
their long homeward trip. Luckily,
they have suffered no major injuries.

Yorio Lists Plans
Of Cheering Block
For Saturday Fray

Registration for the cheering block
has been completed, announces Adele
Yorio, Ed4l, co-chairman.

For the West Virginia game, cheer-
ing block formations will include a
gold P on a blue background alter-
nating with a blue P on a gold back-
ground, a W and V, and a P-I-T-T,
Miss Yorio reports.

Another design which the block
will form during the season is the
Cathedral with a U on one side and
a P on the other. The block will
work with the band again this year
as they did last year in the “Big Ap-
ple,” and capes will be used again.

This year letters will be sent out
to each member of the block telling
exactly what division he is to be in.

Teams M ay Cet
Speedball Rules
At Trees Gym

Speedball rules have been mimeo-
graphed and are available for the
teams at the intramural oﬁice in
Trees gym.

A condensed version of the rules
reveals that a game lasts 42 minutes,
plus three legal time—outs. Four
eight-minute quarters with two-min-
ute intervals between the ﬁrst and
second, and eight minutes rest at the
half split the game into its divisions.
Five-minute periods constitute over-
time play until
broken.

Rule three gives four means of
scoring, a ﬁeld goal garnering three
points, touchdown counting two with
penalty and drop-kicks each giving
out one point. 0

Actual play is a conglomeration of
soccer, football, and basketball.
Dribbling, drop-kicking, passing,
heading, and kicking are all bona-
ﬁde means of advancing ,the ball.
Running with the ball is illegal, how-
ever if the ball is taken on the run,
the referee decides how many steps
the receiver has had to take.

Playing restrictions include "the
usual personal fouls, and blocking,
also technical fouls suchias illegal
substitutions, excessive time-outs,
having more than nine men of one
team on the ﬁeld at the same time,
and unnecessarily delaying the game.
Violations are carrying the ball,
touching a ground ball with head or
arms, making two successive over-
head dribbles, and violating the es-
tablished rules.

Speedball entries close October 6
as do football entries. Horseshoes
and tennis entries are due October 4.
Entry blanks are at the intramural
office in Trees Gym, and are to be
handled by team managers.

Worlimen to Complete
Press Box Remodeling

Remodeling of the press box on the
north side of the stadium will be the
principal non—athletic change specta-
tors will notice when they see the
Panthers class with the West Vir-
ginia Mountaineers next Saturday,
according to stadium officials.

Finished in light gray, the box is
fronted with glass panels so that ob-
servers can watch every detail of

. play. Repairs to refreshment booths,

seats, and steps will be completed be-
fore Saturday. Section numerals and
the scoreboards have been repainted
in black and white to facilitate visi-
bility.

(Salutation):

The journey, so far, has been
varied. it has had both its good
and bad points, and today it was
particularly bad for me. To start
with. the trip from Pittsburgh to
Chicago was uneventful, and every-
one weathered it
0 .K.

At the take
off, Bonelli, Ful-
lerton and Sin-
ko were squeam-
ish. They just
held tight and
rel'u:.=ed to look
up or out. But
once we were
up it became
easy. We left
Pittsburgh b e -
hind, enshroud—
ed in its omni-
present smoke.
(Pretty gnod. eh?)

We flew along at 4,000 feet, aver-
aging about l90 miles per ht-‘>u.r, but
all the time we were not conscious
of speed or great height; we seemed I
to be soaring: or ﬂoating along. The
scene below was impressive with
Checkered patterns of farms, ﬁelds,
and forest.

Because of the light head ivinds
we made Chicago early and landed
at the airport perfectly. Here we
posed for a few TWA pictures and
generall_v limbered up. We also
talked to some people, and they
told us of the big American Legion
Convention there. It took the
parade 15 hours"t’o pass through the
loop.

After 30 minutes there, we left.
Now it was dark with a bright
moon to the rear of us, illuminating
the countryside below (5000 feet)
as well as the ship itself. Stars
were out, and the sky was beauti-
ful. Below us, at 2000 feet, small
clouds were blowing to the north.
Above us at great heights, more
clouds.

This scene was present all the
way in to Minneapolis, our over-
night stop. Landing there, we en-
tered buses and went to the Curtis
Hotel which was a very nice place.
Next morning at 6:30 we left for
the airport; emplaned at 7:30 and

stopped for fuel and while there,

dio station. Charley, (ed. note—-
Bowser) Dees, and Cassiano spoke.

promptu affair.

Leaving Bismark, we ﬂew over
the bad lands of North Dakota, and
they really are bad. Here is where
the misery started, for me at least.
Warm air currents shot up from the

land and caused
air pockets and
buffeting winds.
This made the
air rough like
riding over a
bumpy r o a d—
the only diﬂer-
ence is that on
the r 0 a d you
' bounced b a c k
quickly —- here
you kept on go-
mg.
I thought the
b o t t o m h a d
dropped out of
my stomach several times. I am
afraid a few years of indoor flying
on the Cathedral’s elevators didn’t
help much here. I became pretty
sick but will leave it to your im-
agination for details.

 

Bonelli

Arriving at Billings, Montana
was a. relief. I found others had
not fared so well either. Bobby

Hoel was in a bad way, as well as
Henry Korp (ass’t. mgr.) and oth-
ers were also, but wouldn’t admit
it. This Billings is a nice place,
situated in the Yellowstone Valley.
The airport is on a cliff with the
city surrounding it.

On the cliff is a statue of a man
(two guns) and his pony. Wm. S.
Hart, the old movie star, posed for
it, and it is very impressive. It is
supposed to idealize the “Range
Riders of the Yellowstone”—they
also have a poem inscribed to the
cowboys, although they call them
range riders.

We left Billings. I was feeling a
little better but still shaky. In the
distance we could see the foothills

went soaring over the lake coun-

It wasn’t bad considering the im-

of the Rockies, and the thoughts of
climbing over them‘ were decidedly
not pleasant. We went up 10,000
feet with the air getting rougher
all the time. Dark clouds were
forming ahead, but by this time, I
was so far gone I didn’t care what
happened.

‘Then the hostess (Miss Murphy-—
O.I{.) informed us that the weather
ahead was bad and that the crew
was not permitted to ﬂy on instru-
ments alone so we were turning
back to Helena. This we did in a
hurry, but not before some of the
tougher lads succumbed, they be-
ing: Ted Konetsky, Frank Kristu—
fek, Ralph Fife, etc. Only John
Dickinson, Frank Goodell, and Ben
Kish withstood it.

What a relief to land, but my
stomach was gone. I still didn’t
feel well at all.
From the air-
port, on a stony
plain surround-
ed by ruts, we
took c a b s to
town. We prac-
ticed for a while
at the Helena

I felt much bet-

At present (11:07 P. M., M. S.
T.) the bed looks inviting. I
haven’t eaten now for about 15
hours so I’m a little in. Outside it’s
cold and hailing so it’s a good night
to sleep. Tomorrow we should be
in Seattle, although I must confess
I don’t like the thought of going
over the Rockies with its many air-
pockets and getting sick again.

However—persist.
I’ll write some more later,
if I’m able——
Good luck,

Special Roller
Derby Bates

As fast as ice hockey and twice as
rough, the roller derby is back at
Duquesne Garden this week with the
Pittsburgh team meeting the Eleanor
Powell Hollywood Stars.

Pitt students have a special chance
to see this thrill-a-minute sport by
clipping out the coupon found else-
where on this page. The coupon will
admit two students at only 10 cents
per person, a saving of 80 cents over
the regular 50 cents per person rate.

In an earlier appearance at the
Garden, the roller derby skaters
packed the house as Pittsburgh de-
feated the New York team after a
week of racing. Jeannie Giotte, a
Pittsburgh girl, is a co-captain of the
local outﬁt.

Labeled “hell on wheels,” the roller
derby combines furious racing with
wild spills, occasional serious injuries,
and free—for-all ﬁrst ﬁghts. People
with weak hearts are not advised to
attend.

The racers compete from 8 to 11
o’clock each night.-'0 Student rates
will not be effective after Friday,
October 6.

Debate Coach Announces

Plans for Year’s Work

Cross-question, Forum

To Receive Emphasis
Over Formal Methods

Featuring a departure from con-
ventional methods, the Men’s Debat-
ing Association policy for the year
1939-40 was announced Monday by
Charles W. Lomas, director of the as-
sociation.

“Instead of concentrating upon
formal, tournament debating, the as-
sociation for the last several seasons
has been experimenting with more
informal discussion methods. This
year the group plans to engage in
much cross-question, forum, and
other informal types of debate, rath-
er than the conventionalized styles,”
he explained.

Barnstorming Group

Activities for the Men’s Debating
Association will begin on October 11
when the group will participate in a
symposium on American neutrality
before the Bryn Mawr Women’s
Club, according to Charles W. Lomas,
debate director.

A second group will be organized
to barnstorm with Western Reserve
students during the ﬁnal week in Oc-
tober and the ﬁrst week in Novem-
ber, discussing “Government Owner-
ship of Railroads.”

Previous to the beginning of the
high school debate season, the Uni-
versity will sponsor its annual high
school tournament, attracting an ex-
pected representation from 50 dis-
trict high schools. This year’s tourna-
ment will be held early in Decem-
ber.

In addition to the high school and
intercollegiate participation, the var-
sity squad will speak before meet-
ings of Western Pennsylvania Wo-
men’s Clubs, labor unions, business
mean’s organizations, and unemploy-
ed groups.

Squad Divided

Division of the varsity squad into
these two groups was planned at the
ﬁrst debate meeting Tuesday, at
which twenty upperclassmen and
twenty-ﬁve freshmen were present.
The freshman and varsity groups
will work separately. The ﬁrst var-
sity group will meet Tuesdays at 2:30
o’clock in 1617 Cathedral and the
second varsity group will work on
Thursdays, at 2 o’clock in 1617 Ca-
thedral.

Experienced junior and senior men
who will participate this year include
William Knapp, E40; Thomas Abdo,
C40: Clarence Shepard, BA40; Abe
Wolovitz, C40; Ernest Larson, C40.

Robert Shaw, Ed41; Fred Roth,
Ed41; Ruggero Aldisert, C41; Fred
Robie Ed4l, and Gerald Ziskind, C41.

ment for The News and Panther.

Mr. Fitzgerald said in regard to
the establishment of the board, “this
meeting of the board is very encour-
aging. It is from meetings of this
type that we will be able to get a
uniﬁed picture of what the publica-
tions are attempting to accomplish.

According to a statement from of-
ficial University sources, the func-
tion of the Publications Board will
be to select from candidates from the
publications staffs, the editors and
business managers of The News,
Panther, and Owl; to interpret the
University policy to the publications,

publications.
Committees Meet Often

Provision has been made for the
board to meet at least three times
each year at designated periods and
for the executive committees, repre-
senting The News, Panther, and Owl,
to meet whenever deemed necessary
by the chairman or a majority of
members. The executive committees
will interview applicants for positions
as editors or business managers.

Until two years ago a publications
board composed of the dean of men,
the dean of women, and the director
of the University News Service func-
tioned. Student publlcation leaders
were invited to meetings only as a
courtesy and had no official status on
the board. The board was dissolved
in 1937 and ﬁnally in the fall of
1938, Mr. Machesney was appointed
to the post of adviser to publications.
Last Yea-r’s Committee

The committee which met last
spring, and which was responsible
for the organization of the plan for
the government of publications was
composed of the following people:
Miss Amos, Dr. Lanfear, Mr. Isaacs,
Mr. Buckner, Dr. Hutchisson, Dr.
Kendall Tesh, professor of chemistry,
Mr. Graham, Mr. Machesney.

Student members of the committee
were Edith Bart, C39; chief justice
of Senior Court; Roberta Webb, C39,
president of the Women’s Athletic
Association; Dorothy Dering C39,
president of WSGA; Harold Vieh-
man, C39, Owl editor; Thomas
Smith, C39, Panther editor; John
Martinco, C39, editor of the Pitt
News; John Downie, BA39, president
of SFA; William Hoeveler, C39, pres-
ident of Men’s Council; Bernard Mc-

gerald.
