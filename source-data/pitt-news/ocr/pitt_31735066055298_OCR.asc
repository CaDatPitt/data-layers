Pitt student commits suicide
26-year-old jumps from 35th floor of the Cathedra/

By Mark Gordon

The Pitt News

A Pitt student committed suicide over Spring Break as he

jumped from the the 35th ﬂoor of the Cathedral of Learning.

John Solot, 26, an undergraduate in the College of Arts and
Sciences, was pronounced dead at 6:10 a.m. last Thursday.

“This is a very tragic event, and our hearts go the student and
his family,” said Pitt spokesperson Ken Service.

The Allegheny County Coroner’s office said that he died of
blunt force to his head, neck and chest after he jumped out of the

Cathedral.

His body was found near the east side of the building, and
police say he jumped off from the side facing Heinz Chapel. No
other information was released by Pittsburgh City Police or Pitt

Police, at the request of the family. '

A funeral and private family service was held for Solot

Sunday at a funeral home in Shadyside.

Shortly after the incident, all three local Pittsburgh television
stations and several local radio stations reported that the incident
involved a middle-aged man who had been stabbed to death.on

Pitt’s campus.
But Service said that police confirmed it was a suicide.

Pitt TAs, grad students,
debate fanning a union

By Mark Gordon
Editor in Chief

It seems that Yale University has more than ivy walls,
preppies and millions of dollars in endowments.

They have students and teaching assistantsiwho want to go
on strike. And if the debate in the William Pitt Union last
night was any indication, Pitt TAs and grad students might
be next in line.

' The Graduate Employee and Student Organization at Yale
is currently involved in a debate with its administration and
is gathering national attention. . . . .

Yesterday, the union organizer, Corey Robin, came to Pitt.
He spoke to about 50 students early in the afternoon and
took the pro-union stance in last night’s debate, which was

Network. -

“When you say you don’t want a union, you’re "letting a
small group of people make all the decisions,” Robin said.

He was referring to what he considers to be a pattern in
schools such as Yale of letting the “hierarchy, or board of
trustees,” make all the decisions.

“I think there’s been an excessive concern with the bottom
line,” Robin added to a crowd of about 30 undergraduates
and grad students.

Karl Seaquist, a Pitt grad student studying Classics, coun-
tered Robin’s pro-union stance. . ,

“Unions aren’t just representative bodies, like a student
government organization,” he said. “‘They bargain collec-
tively and they have the power to strike.” —

Seaquist said that TAs and grad students at Pitt, as at any
other_ school, are there primarily to learn.

“And we’re here to learn how to teach.” _

One of Seaquist’s main problems with the idea of unioniz-
ing at college.was that “you know what you are getting

Teen mom juggles classes, job and toddlers

By Melissa Mcgee
F or The Pitt News '

Most teenagers worry
about getting out of school,
shopping and partying with
their friends.

For teenage mothers, these
worries have been replaced
with studying, jobs, money
and their children.

According to Planned
Parenthood, an organization
that helps pregnant teenagers
plan their pregnancies and
futures, more than one mil-.
lion teenage girls become
pregnant each year.

Statistics from the
Research and Development
Division of Planned
Parenthood Federation of
America show that of these
one million pregnant girls,
90 percent decide to keep
their babies.

“Most are very excited
when they learn they are
pregnant,” said Catherine
Monserrat, a family life spe-
cialist for Planned
Parenthood. “But statistics
show that their experiences
end up being far more than
anticipated.”

Many teenage mothers are

overcome by financial, edu-
cational, social and emotion-
al challenges associated with
pregnancy.

Even though most teenage
mothers face these chal-
lenges, 94 percent of preg-
nant teenagers decide to
raise their children on their
own.

. “Many girls try to raise the
baby without the help of the
father, their parents and rela-
tives or other sources of sup-

port,” said Jeanne Lindsay,-

author of “Pregnant Too
Soonf’
“This may help explain

why,” Lindsay said. “9O per-
cent of single teenage moth-
ers drop out of high school
and go on welfare.”

However, some teenage
mothers overcome the odds.

Stacey Mitts knows how
much work goes into being a
teenage mother.

Mitts, 19, is the mother of
two young girls, Shalyce, 2
1/2, and Jasmine, 1.

Besides being a full-time
mother‘, she is also a full-
time student at Pitt and a
waitress at Gaetano’s
Restaurant on Banksville

WASHINGTON — The
Senate moved to punish the
Cuban government for its
downing of two American
private aircraft last month,
passing legislation that
would tighten the embargo
on American trade with Cuba
and punish other countries
that insist on continuing
trade on their own.

The vote on the final com-
promise version of legisla-
tion, first approved by the
House and Senate last fall,
was 74-22. The compromise
now goes to the House,
which is expected to approve
it later this week. The New

WASHINGTON — The

importation of the sedative
Rohypnol, saying the pill is a

WASHINGTON — Senator
Bob Dole swept a string of
primaries across the

Northeast, thrusting himself
convincingly to the front of
the pack in the biggest tes-t

In uninterrupted triumphs,
Dole won easily in
Massachusetts, Connecticut,
Maryland, Vermont and
Maine. And even before the
results were tallied, Dole

‘claimed victory in the other

WASHINGTON —
Acknowledging that
Congress does not have the
political will to do the job
itself, a bipartisan group of
senators pushed for the for-
mation of an independent
commission to help drastical-
ly cut the subsidies and tax
breaks for business that they
called “corporate welfare.”

With the role of business in
society emerging as a potent
issue in the presidential cam-
paign, the senators argued
that the time was right for a
sweeping reduction in the
tens of billions of dollars in
special breaks. The New York

“Even though I am always busy
with the children, I do not regret my
decision to have either of them,”
Mitts said.

Mitts found out she was pregnant
with her first child when she was 15
years old and a junior in high school.

“I was very scared,” she said. “My
parents kicked me out, and I did not
know what I was going to do.”

Luckily, Mitts had friends and
other relatives to rely on during her
pregnancy.

“My friends were very excited for
me. They took care of me,” she said.

The father of the child and Mitts’
boyfriend at the time, Roy, was also
there for support.

Shalyce was born on May 1, 1993.

Although Mitts had to miss some
classes when Shalyce was born, she
went on to rank sixth in her high
school class and was accepted by the
College of Arts and Sciences.

“I could not have done it without
the help of my friends and my teach-
ers. My teachers were very

“My friends were very excited
when they found out I was pregnant,
but once I had my children, they did
not want to help out.”

One of Mitts’ closest friends,
Missy, is the godmother of her two
children. Missy has been there

college.

Mom’s House provides teenage
mothers with free day-care services
in return for volunteering at the cen-
ter at least three hours a week.

‘ The organization also offers
teenage mothers classes in parenting,

private counseling, tutoring and-

other opportunities for scholarships

and grants. .

“I don’t know what I would have
done if I didn’t have Mom’s House,”
Mitts said. “I don’t have enough
money to afford day care. Mom’s
House works around the schedule of
a student, which many other day-care
centers do not

“We are all part of a big family at
Mom’s House, helping one another.
It is organizations like Mom’s House
that let single teenage mothers and
their children make it in this world.”

Mitts was recently named the

mothers’ representative of the

Brookline Branch of Mom’s House.
She was selected from_more than 20
mothers to represent the center at
monthly council meetings.

Mitts does not regret her decisions
to have Shalyce and Jasmine, but she
doeslhave some advice for anyone
who is thinking about having a baby.

“If you want to bring a child into
this world, make sure you have
something to bring it into. If you are
not ready for your future, you are not
ready for a child.”

understanding.”

Mitts began her college
career in the fall of 1994.
She had not chosen a major
yet, but she knew she wanted
to do something in the field
of child development. '

Right after she started her
first semester at Pitt, Mitts
found out she was pregnant
with her second child. ~

“I was shocked. My family
was shocked. They immedi- '
ately wanted me to have an
abortion,” said Mitts.

Mitts considered this
option but decided against it
because she knew that she
would not be able to go
through withit.

“I don’t know what I
would do without Sha1yce,”
she said. “What if I would
have had an abortion when I
was pregnant with her? Ijust
could not do it.”

Again, Mitts had to rely on
her close friends, family
members and the baby’s
father, Roy, for support.

Mitts stayed in school and
had Jasmine right before
winter break. ‘

Mitts’ days have been very
hectic since the birth of her
two children. '

“I get up at 6:30 a.m. I
have to get myself and the
girls ready and take them to
day care. Then I have to go
to class. I am usually done
with classes around 3 p.m. I
have to pick up the girls at
day care and take care of my
responsibilities there, such
as cleaning and laundry.

“If I have to go to work, I

I come home, I clean, do my

Students win first step
in light to restore aid

The Senate approved an amendment yesterday after-
noon that will restore funds for student aid by a land-
slide vote of 84-16.

The pressure of grassroots efforts piled on by students
from across the country, including two Pitt representa-
tives, Brian Heffron and Keith Campbell, helped force
Democrats and Republicans to come to a compromise.
The amendment will restore the State Student Incentive
Grant and Perkins Loans to FY95 levels.

Senate -Democrats had been working since late last
week on an amendment that would restore the $3.3 bil-
lion in cuts to education programs, but it was unclear
whether the Daschle (D-SD) Amendment added a sec-
ond degree amendment that would restore the funding
for student aid.

The amendment also provided addbacks for GOALS
2000, School to Work, Head Start and job training pro-
grams — totaling $3.1 billion in restorations to educa-
tional programs.

Despite yesterday’s student victory, the fight has not
ended. The next battle will be to force the House to
recede to the Senate’s overwhelming position to level
fund education programs.

Read on tomorrow to learn more about the battle ‘to
save student aid.

Opinions
Get with it, TV news

TV news stations in Pittsburgh are up to their old tricks.

If their money giveaways during “sweeps wee ” weren’t enough to
make your stomach churn, then this certainly will.

KDKA, WTAE and that hot bed of journalistic integrity, WPXI, went
for the grand slam last week. They whiffed.

The trio of stations (along with some local radio stations, like KQV)
was not about to let facts get in the way of a good story.

It seems that they came across a dead body in front of the Cathedral of
learning. After that, it was standard Pittsburgh TV journalism.

Forget about checking to see if they were right, the TV news stations
went on air with a story about a “rr1iddle-aged balding” man who was
found stabbed to death on Pitt’s campus.

Once again, there’s the problem of those nasty little things called facts.
Like it wasn’t a homicide: It was a suicide. And it wasn’t a balding mid-
dle-aged guy: It was a Pitt student, 26 years sold. And he wasn’t stabbed
in the chest: He jumped off the 35th ﬂoor of the Cathedral of Learning. '

So television news in Pittsburgh messed up. And to top it off, once they
realized their error, their retractions were poor, and in some cases nonex-
istent.

Granted, everyone (even The Pitt News) makes mistakes now and
then. But the pattem of screw-ups in TV land is becoming a pretty scary
one. .

And this was so easily avoidable. All they had to do was check up on a
few facts. Maybe they could’ve picked up a phone.

But thanks to their careless behavior, a common conversation around
campus these days starts something like: “Did you hear about the guy
that was stabbed?”

Oakland and Pitt have enough problems convincing‘ people that this is
a safe place to go to school. They don’t need any helpfrom TV news sta-
tions that can’t seem to get with the program.

Get with it, Tennessee

Last week, the Tennessee state legislature passed a law that seems to
hail straight from the 19th century. It states that any public school teacher
who teaches evolution as fact can be ﬁred (Pittsburgh Post-Gazette).

Maybe William Jennings Bryan and Clarence Darrow should be
thawed out to argue the ﬁrst trial of this new law. It was in Dayton, Tenn.,
71 years ago that these men argued the infamous John Scopes trial, in
which Scopes was convicted of teaching evolution. Before you know
who, this was widely considered to ‘be the trial of the century.

While The Pitt News doesn’t pretend to have the-answers to life and the
universe, there is plenty of scientiﬁc evidence supporting evolution as a
biological fact. Evolution and creationism are not mutually exclusive. No
matter where you believe the world came from, it is clear that nature is
constantly changing and that evolution is at work in the world around us.

Separation of church and state is an important principle that should not
be overlooked, but even more appalling is that any government can
attempt to legislate facts. Governments exist to make the rules for society,
not to pass judgement on truth. Next, maybe they’ll pass a law saying
2+k5 or that the sky is_ orange.

The loose Bchanan factor

ime to play 20
q u e s t i o n s .
_ The guy I’m thinking

of is a Nazi. Or a demon.
Or the devil himself. Or
just a plain, down—and-out

evil guy who hates every-

one in America and espe-
cially the rest of the world.

He has some real
whacked—out ideas, like
thinking of America before
Cuba, making people work
to get paid and ending
trade agreements with
countries that are bankrupt.

Can you
guess who this terrible,
horrible person is?

It’s Pat Buchanan, the
conservative television
commentator who’s running
an uphill battle to become
the Republican nominee
and who will try to remove
the used-car salesman who
currently occupies the
White House.

The majority of televi-
sion and print media are
usually bent to the left, but
the recent crucification and
vilification of Buchanan
takes them to new levels of
bad leftist journalism.

The only positive thing to
come out of Buchanan’s
inauguration as media
whipping boy is that it
gives Newt Gingrich time

to concentrate on being the"

most powerful man in
Washington, D.C., instead
of trying’ to fend off the
media.

Back to Buchanan. No
doubt, he has some dirty
laundry. He’s far from the
perfect presidential candi-
date. One person close to
his campaign said in a
recent U.S. News and
World Report article that
Buchanan’s “not a racist,
but he attracts them.” So
it’s clear he’s not the per-
fect person for the White
House.

That being said, clear

    

take a wild’

Mark
Gordon

mumbo jumbo for a second
and look at some of his
ideas. Or better yet, listen
to some of his plans, and
forget for a second that
he’s the devil. .

Like his plan to block all
illegal immigrants from
coming into the United
States through Mexico.
He’s talked about building
a wall to “keep José out.” I
think that idea has a lot of
merit. No other country in
the world offers the free-
dom that this one does, and
yet we protect our free-
doms from outsiders like a
free buffet.

Some other Buchanan
philosophies: He wants to
end welfare. He wants peo-
ple to work for a paycheck,
not to get it because they
have three kids before their
20th birthday.

He deplores Washington
lobbyists for their lack of
ethics and fights Wall
Street and Big Business
tycoons for hurting the

T “American family.”

Even some of his enemies
in the Clinton camp admit
that he puts America first
at any Sacrifice.

No matter what your
political persuasion 
most of Buchanan’s ideas
make a lot of sense. But the
majority of Americans —
conservatives and liberals
— only see one thing when
they think of Buchanan.
and that’s the devil.

And most of the blame

for this lies in the palms of .

the national media. A
Republican who voted for
Bob Dole in the recent New
York primary said there
was no way she could vote
for Buchanan.

“If he’s president of the
United States,~I’d live in
fear,” she said on, what
else, the “CBS Evening
News with Dan Ratherf’
“He’s a Nazi.” ‘ ' ‘

Huh? Now I don’t follow‘-

everything Buchanan does
and I haven’t heard all of
his speeches, but I highly
doubt he’s a Nazi. I really
don’t think he’s going to
try to eliminate entire reli-
gions from the face off the
earth.

And for some reason, I
don’t believe that, if he
were elected, Buchanan
would imperialistically try
to take over the world, like
Hitler did with Europe in
the Nazi-party heyday.

Buchanan is just one guy
with "a vision of a different
America, one that conceiv-
ably is better than what’s
going on right now. His
ideas are far from perfect,
some of them need work.
And to be sure. he’s got
some political baggage.
Even Ronald Reagan had
some flaws’.

But Buchanan isn‘t a
Nazi, and he’s not the
devil. And the only reason
I didn’t vote for him in
my state’s primary last
week has nothing to do
with his vision for
America.

I didn’t vote for him‘

because the media has
successfully vilified him
so much that there’s no
chance Pat Buchanan will
accomplish the ABC goal
on Nov. 5. And that's the
most important thing.

By the way. that's
Anybody But Clinton.

Pitt turns its
head and

coughs

  

Columnist U
Sean
Duncan _

NEW YORK

adison Square
Garden’s score-
board told the

whole story. With a minute
left in the game, Pitt trailed
by two.

The scenario was oh so
familiar.

Then, as the Panthers
have done all year, they
paused, counted to three
and put their collective fists

. in their mouths and swal-

lowed.

Sure enough, as Pitt
swung the ball around for
an open look at the basket,
Jason Maile delivered a ,
pass to Andre Alridge. The
ball went through Alridge’s
hands and right to a Boston
College defender.

Fortunately for Pitt, it
held Boston College, giving
the Panthers one last chance
to choke.

With their hands still
stuck firmly in their craws,
the Panthers came out of a
time-out and executed a
broken play, which resulted
in a twisting Jerry

‘ McCullough reverse layup

that touched nothing but
backboard.

Déja vu. Pitt blew another
one —this time in the Big
East Tournament opening
round last Wednesday, 70-
66.

The season couldn’t have
ended on a more appropri-
ate note. Pitt’s inability to
execute in the final minutes
of the game cost it another
win, a win that this team
desperately needed.

A season that started off
with the promise of a 6-
year-old child quickly
turned into a whiny, pim-
ply-faced brat that couldn’t
do anything but sit on the
couch and complain that
nobody likes it. After Pitt
beat Notre Dame Jan. 13,
the Panthers were 8-3 and
about to crack the top 25.

Then Pitt proceeded to
tank 14 of its last 16 games,
as it finished the season
with an astounding 10-17
record, one less loss than
last year.

Out of the 17 losses, eight
of them were in the typical

Piﬂ falls short ugani BC, 70-66

By Brad Isles
Sports Editor

NEW YORK— The only thing different was the I
arena.

Last Wednesday in Madison Square Garden, the scene
was all too familiar, and so was the result.

Pitt was down by two with less than a minute to go in
its first-round game of the Big East Tournament against
Boston College.

Down 68-66 with 15 seconds left, Jerry McCullough
drove into the lane, ghastly resembling Andre Alridge’s
drive in the closing seconds against Massachusetts.

And like Alridge’s, McCullough’s game-tying attempt
bounced off the rim. Two Danya Abrams free throws
later, Pitt lost, 70-66. _

The win was the Eagles’ 18th of the season, and it
solidified their bid in the NCAA Tournament, "where
they will play Indiana in the first round. _

‘ “We felt going into this game we deserved to be in the
tournament,” Boston College Coach Jim O’Brien said. “I
think to make sure it was going to happen for us, we felt
this was an important game.”

The loss to Boston College put the finishing touches
on a year once filled with promise and fulfillment of pre— _
season expectations after the Panthers jumped out to an ‘
8-3 record. But something changed drastically, and Pitt :
lost 14 of'16 down the stretch, finishing with a 10-17 : V V
record. 1

Pitt guard Jason Maile came off the bench and did 
everything he -could to keep an upset within the 1 -
Panthers’ sights. He led Pitt with 23 points, including ‘
four 3—pointers. He nearly matched his career-high 28 
points, which came in the Garden in last year’s tourna- ;
ment opening game against St. John’s. ‘

“My teammates got .me open and got me the ball, and I E. .. .19 1

was hitting some shots,” Maile said. “I was on tonight.”

Baseball starts season

By Kevin Lilley " ‘
Staff Writer

Over the course of an agonizing 1995-96 season, the Pitt Lady
Panthers managed only two wins in conference play.

In a three-day stint at the University of Connecticut, the site of the
Big East Women’s Basketball Championship, the Panthers equalled
their total, winning their ﬁrst two games before bowing out to tour-
ney champion Connecticut in the semiﬁnals. 9

“We were going up there just to play,” said Pitt freshman Gina
Montesano. “We ﬁgured we had nothing to lose." Montesano and the
Panthers ended up taking out two top seeds before facing UConn.

The Huskies got 22 points from Kara Wolters in their 83-51 victo-
ry, bringing the underdog Panthers back to earth after wins over

Miami and Villanova. Momentum was not enough for Pitt against ,

the Huskies, who stormed out to an early 9-2 lead and took a 20-
point advantage into halftime.

Stephanie Petho paced the Panthers with 13 points in 26 minutes
and also led the team with ﬁve rebounds from her shooting guard
position. Center Latia Howardadded four boards to her 11 points,
which placed her second in both categories. Montesano tallied six
points and led the team with four assists and two steals in the contest

“[Stephanie] stepped up,” said Montesano, who also praised the
seniors for their eﬁort in the semiﬁnal match. Julie Fomadel scored
nine points in her farewell game, with Tressa Bolfert adding two
points and three boards in limited action.

Despite the numbers, the Lady Panthers were outplayed by their
UConn counterparts. Wolters and Connecticut forward Jamelle
Elliott controlled the boards all evening, earning 13 and 15 boards,
respectively. Despite the efforts of Petho and Howard, the Lady
Panthers were outrebounded as a team 53-.29.

Petho’s foil at shooting guard, Connecticut’s Nykesha Sales, gave
the Pitt senior trouble by scoring 16 points in only 15 minutes of
play. Sales went 8-for-10 from the ﬂoor for the night, including a

By Matt Grove

While many Pitt students packed their bags and headed
out for Spring Break last week, the Pitt baseball team was
hard at work beginning its quest to repeat as Big East
champion. ’ ’

The Panthers opened the 1996 season with the annual
spring trip to Florida and came home with an 8-4-1 record.

“I thought we were really well prepared coming into the
trip,” Panther Coach Mark Jackson said. “I feel we»defi-
nitely came to play up to the competition.”

Pitt looked to its experienced players to get out of the

Womelsdorf racked up 15 hits and crossed the plate nine
times through the first 12 games while hitting .375. In a
16-6 win over Fordham, Womelsdorf went 4-for-5 with 2
RBIs and scored three times. ‘ «

“Kurt is one of those fifth-year guys that we’re looking
to for leadership, but it’s not going to be just one player
doing it,” Jackson said.

The Panthers led 7-6 after six innings but scored four
runs in both the seventh and eighth innings and added one
more in the ninth to put away the Rams. Rob Shaffer got
the win for the Panthers by tossing six innings and strik-
ing out seven. Steve Kubicek recorded the save for Pitt as
he struck out six in three innings of work. i

The Panthers got another lopsided victory when they
faced IUP. Pitt scored 19 runs, including a pair of eight-
run innings, on 13 hits and had only one error. Sophomore

win, while freshman shortstop Lou Melucci went 3-for-4
with three RBIs and three runs scored. ‘

suiiers four
losses on

Florida trip

 

By Paul Kogut
Staff Writer

_Spring Break ‘96: sun, fun‘

and four tough losses in beau-
tiful Florida. That’s what this
year’s break spelled for the
women’s tennis team (6-6).
The Panthers fell during the
week to St. Cloud State
University, 4-3; the University
of Central Florida, 9-0; the
University of South Florida, 9-
O; and the University of
Wisconsin—Green Bay, 8-1.
But hey, Coach George
Dieffenbach expected top-
flight competition, especially

~from the Florida-based

schools.

“They have very strong pro- '

grams,” Dieffenbach said.
“Some of the best players in
the nation go to. those
schools."

In fact, the Panthers came
the closest to beating the St.
Cloud Huskies. from St.
Cloud, Minn. ~

The Panther’s highlights
from that match were: Alison
Baker (the team’s No. 3 seed)
scoring a 6-2, 6-1 win against
Sara Vandereyk; Marla
Zielinksi (No. 4) notching a 6-
2, 6-3 win against Susy
Cronick; and Jen Bible (No. 6)
resurrecting her play to beat
Erin Schwager 4-6, 6-4, 6-2.

Also versus the Huskies, the
team of Baker and freshman
Erin Shalbrack (No. 2) nipped
its opponents 9-8. However,
the victory did not net Pitt a
point, since the Panthers’ other
two doubles -teams lost and a
team must win at least two of
the three doubles matches to
earn the point.

The Panthers hosted the
Huskies and the University of
Wisconsin—Green Bay at their
home court away from home

'court, the Orang_e Lakes

Country Club, which is just
outside of Orlando.

The Panthers jogged over to

Junior outfielder Jason Conti also had two
RBIs and scored two runs. Conti had a
team-high 12 runs scored through the first
12 games while collecting 10 hits "and eight
RBIs.

Melucci rounded out the week with a .349
batting average and tied Womelsdorf with a
team-high 15 hits. He also knocked in seven
runs and scored nine times, but Jackson
wasn’t surprised at the play of the fresh-
man.

“We all know he’s a really good player;

he showed it down there.”

Other Panther wins included included a 5-
4 win over LaSalle and a 6-3 victory over
Thomas‘ More College.

In the Panthers’ eight wins, they saw
eight different pitchers record victories —
much different than last season.

“This pitching staff has a lot more depth
than we’ve had in the past, “Jackson said.
“We expect more than three or four pitchers
to contribute this season.”

Pitt’s game with Duquesne scheduled for
today has been postponed until Thursday.

game-opening 3—pointer from the left side that set the night's tone.
She also led all players with four steals in her limited action.

The Lady Panthers fared better in early tournament action, knock-
ing off fourth-seeded Miami and ﬁfth—seeded Villanova on the way to
the semiﬁnals. Both games were close, with scores of 52-49 and 59-
57 in the Panther victories. Partially due to the Panther upsets, neither
the Hurricanes nor the 21-7 Wildcats were invited to the NCAA or
NH‘ Women’s Tournaments.

“It’s rewarding,” said Montesano of Pitt’s giant—killing.
“[Villanova] beat us pretty bad during the season. That had to be one
of the most exciting games I’ve ever played in.” ‘

Montesano played all 40 minutes in Pitt’s victory over the ‘Cats,
scoring nine points and keeping Villanova’s star point guard Sue
Glenning to only 13 points on the evening. Howard led all scorers
with 23 points and registered 14 rebounds for the Lady Panthers.

The close contest with Villanova came after the Lady Panthers
escaped the-opening round with a two—point upset of the Hurricanes.
Behind by as many as nine in the second half, Pitt fought back behind
Petho’s 24 points and more Montesano defense, as the freshman held
Miarni’s leading scorer Octavia Blue to 10 points.

“Whatever role you have to play that day, you do it,” said
Montesano, who added a tearn-leading three assists to her defensive
play in the first-round match.

Blue did score off of a spin move to give the Hurricanes a 49-48
lead with only 43 seconds to play, seemingly ending the Panther run
before it began. However, with 26 ticks left, Petho sank a pull-up
jumpshot to give the Panthers the lead. A defensive stand forced a
Hurricanes foul, and Petho made both foul shots to seal the victory.
All told, the Pitt senior scored eight of the teaIn’s final 10 points.

Montesano cited the pressure on Pitt’s higher ranked opponents as
a key factor in the Panther victories. She said that Pitt brought a
“pretty much laid-back atmosphere” to the tournament as the last
seed, helping the Panthers cope with the Big East spotlight.

‘Ralph Willard said.

Pitt managed to keep the game close
in the first half, thanks mainly to
Maile’s bombs from the perimeter. He
hit three of his 3-pointers in the first, en
route to scoring ll in the half.

His three from the right baseline at
6253 gave Pitt its first lead, 25-24. But
Boston College recaptured the lead 13
seconds later when guard Scoonie Penn
countered with a 3-pointer of his own.

Then with 1:36 left in the half,
Cummings hit an open 3-pointer from
the left side on an inbound play from
Andre Alridge. The shot gave Pitt its
second lead of the game, 35-34. That
lead lasted just 14 seconds, until Gerald
Jordan was whistled for goaltending a
J ourdon layup.

Pitt went into halftime trailing 37-35,
despite being outrebounded 26-ll.
Jourdon grabbed eight of his nine

- boards in the first half.

“I thought that the game. was a little
bit weird,” O’Brien said. “We were
saying at halftime that the game just

in the first half. They shot great from
the 3-point line, and we were fortunate
to be up by two at the half.”

The halftime break cooled down the
Panthers’ half-court offense, while it
breathed new life into the Eagles’.

Boston College went on a l5-3 run to

able to withstand it.

“We, at times, have been a very
tough—minded team. Just when it seems
like things are falling apart, we are able
to make a play and do just enough to
hang in there and allow us to win
ames at the end.”

Over that span, Pitt 
failed to connect on a 
single field goal, its 
only points coming on a 
free throw by Chad 
Varga and two by Maile. 

Center Mark Blount 
stopped the Eagles’ run 
with a six-footer in the 
lane, bringing the 
Panthers within 12. The 
hoop ignited a Pitt run,

 and POETRY.

The Eagles came down to the other
end of the court, and Penn found
Antonio Granger open in the left cor-
ner. He hit the 3-pointer, his only bas-
ket of the game, over an outstretched
Howard. The hoop recaptured the lead
for Boston College, 68-66.

Howard was in for Varga, who was
on the bench the last 3:40 of the game
with a concussion after being elbowed
in the head by Abrams.

After Granger’s hoop, Pitt called
timeout. On its next possession, Maile
threw a high, hard pass that Alridge
couldn’t handle, and Bost_on College
grabbed the turnover.

With the shot clock running out,
Abrams forced up a 3-pointer. Pitt got
the rebound —— and its final chance.

“You can’t criticize a particular play-
er,” Willard said. “They’re trying to
make plays. I don’t think it was
Andre’s turnover. Jason wanted to get
him the ball, and he threw it a little
hard and high. Andre probably should
have caught the ball, but Jason proba-
bly wishes he wouldn’t have thrown it
so hard.”
