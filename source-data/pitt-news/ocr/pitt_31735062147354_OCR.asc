Local Business
Attains New High

Pittsburgh Business Review Shows
Gain Despite Seasonal Let-Up

Business in the Pittsburgh district
in December reached a new high
level in the recovery period despite
a moderate setback late in the month,
records the “Pittsburgh Business Re-
view” published monthly by the Bu-
reau of Business Research.

The Bureau further explains the de-
crease in production during the
Christmas holidays as no more than
seasonal in many of the major indus-
tries. The steel industry was among
those that reduced operations during
the latter part of December, After
January 1st, however, the rate was
increased, and in the third week of
the month, plants in the district were
working at a rate only slightly under
that in the ﬁrst half of December.

The monthly index of business in
the district rose from about 75 per
cent of normal in November to 78 per
cent of normal in December. This.
was a gain of seven per cent over}
October and a gain of about 12 per
cent over the level of business in
September.

Reports in other lines of business
show a general improvement for the
year. Among these were the plate
glass industry, petroleum production,
industrial electric power.

The major exception to this was the
building and construction industry
which continued to decline long after
the other industries started to im-
prove.

Tal Henry Signed
For Greek Dance

n..

Favors Promised For Formal Ball
February 14 In William Penn

 

The featured attractions at the
annual Interfraternity Ball next Fri-
day will be Tal Henry and his North
Carolinians, programs and favors, and
a $3 admission charge. The ticket
stub will be good for reduced parking

rates. The VVilliam Penn Hotel ball-
room will be the scene.

Tal Henry, who played here for
the Junior Prom two years ago, has
been heard over the NBC networks
from the Hotel New Yorker and is
well-known for his recordings and
movie shorts.

According to his press release, “the
high quality of their musical rendi-
tions has caused critics to claim that
this group of youngsters is to be
reckoned along with the White-mans,
the Bernies, the Lopez-es, and the
Reismans.

“Tal never knew his real name.
Since his ﬁrst says, his mother and
father termed him by that short, care-
less, yet strangely sufficient syllable
which suits his charming personality
precisely.

“At an early age Tal was to be
seen daily, ﬁddling away at a battered
old violin one hour, and the next,
ﬁngering idly the keys of the family

"pianny.’ At 16 he organized his ﬁrst
orchestra.” The press releases say
so.

New Eighth Floor Quarters Recall
Atmosphere 0fY Hut Main Room

 

The hollow sound of ping-pong balls
striking against wooden paddles; the
click of billiard balls carroming off
one another; the hushed buzz of con-
versation; these sounds, formerly part
and parcel of the main room of the
old Y Hut, will be heard again . .
in the Cathedral.

This semester a new smoking and
lunch room will be opened to men
students of the University, W. VV.
Mendenhall, executive secretary of
the YMCA, announced today.

The new room will be in Room 817,
Cathedral. It will be open to any
male student who has a yen to slap a
ping-pong ball around, to anyone who
wants to sit and sleeplly page through
the latest magazines. The magazines
will be supplied by the YMCA, and,
as of old, Miss Mary Dempster, Y sec-

retary, will have charge of them. Or,
if you just want to eat, you will be
able to buy a lunch on the eighth
ﬂoor.

- In short, the new room plans to be
the same as its counterpart at the
Hut, except that you won’t have to
walk to get there. Membership in the
YMCA is not necessary to enjoy the
facilities of the new room. It is open
to any and all men students on the
campus.

According to Mr. John Weber, busi-
ness manager of the University, the
room was designed for the purpose of
providing a place where all men car-
rying lunches or buying them from
the various candy stands throughout

the building could eat together. It is
alsoc intended to discourage e-ating
lunches and ‘ leaving their refuse

throughout the building.

Analyshis Course
Will Be Oﬁered

Study Of Industrial Spectroscopy
Listed By Physics. Department

A course in industrial spectroscopy,
the ﬁrst of its kind in the Pittsburgh
district, is now being given by the de-
partment of physics of the University.
A growing demand for spectrographic
analysis to supplement, and in some
speciﬁc cases to replace, chemical
analysis in industrial laboratories is
responsible for its introduction.

The purposes of this course will be:
(1) to study the principles a11d tech-
nique used in making spectrographic
analyses; (2) to discuss applications
of this method iii the metallurgical,
mineralogical, ceramic, biological, and
astrophysical ﬁelds; and (3) to have
each student acquire experience in
making such analysis. The course
will deal primarily with qualitative
and quantitative analysis by emission
spectra, although absorption spec-
troscopy will also be discussed.-

The course is directed by Miss
Mary E. Warga, fellowship assistant
of Mellon Institute, whose experience
in spectrographic analysis has been in
the astrophysical, mineralogical, ce-
ramic, and m.etallurgical ﬁelds. Fur-
ther details are available in the office
of the department, Thaw Hall.

Hallock To Conduct Survey
Of Engineering Production

 

By John P. Martinco

Guiding the policy and activities of
thousands of alumni of the University
is not the only responsibility of the
General Secretary of the Alumni As-
sociation, John VV. Hallock. He has
recently made public the fact that he
is serving as chief of the Pittsburgh
Engineers’ Procurement District of
the United States Army.

As one of his duties in this posi-
tion, he is now engaged in a period
of two weeks of active duty making a
survey of industrial production of en-
gineering equipment and supplies in
the district, which will terminate on
Monday.

Mr. Hallock holds the official com-
mission of Lieutenant-Colonel in the
Corps of Engineers’ Reserves. On
April 13, he is scheduled for promo-
tion to the rank of Colonel.

The district of which he is head in-
cludes the western half of Pennsylva-
nia and all of Ohio, West Virginia,
Tennessee, and Kentucky. His duty
is to map out the work for the reg-
ular lieutenants to carry out.

Serving in action in the World War,
Mr. Hallock gained the necessary ex-
perience and background for this type
of work and put himself in line for

the appointment. He was with a
corps of engineers, engaged in search-
light work in the anti-aircraft corps.
In action with that body, he was c011-
fronted with many perilous experi-
ences, some of which he refuses to
speak of today. In July, 1918, he was
promoted to a captaincy, after the
war he was made a major.

In August, 1925, he was promoted
to his present post after the death
of his predecessor, Colonel Beach. “I
got the job over night,” he relates,
“and hardly knew what to do with it.”
For the nine years following he has
been at the same post, although in
1929, he was commissioned Lieuten-
ant-Colonel.

Now, since it was 15 years ago that
the last survey was undertaken, he is
making a re-survey to bring the sta-
tistics up to date.

Mr. Hallock is now working to build
up the membership of the Alumni Or-
ganization, and to arouse its sense of
interest in University affairs. In this,
he has been progressing quite suc-
cessfully, continually adding to the
membership until it is mounting well
over the 2,000 mark, and increasing
the activities of a group that was dor-

mant only a few years ago.

Dean Announces
Course Changes

Dowling, Graduate Of University,
Will Take Hobbah’s Place

VVith the advent of the second se-
mester several changes in the faculty
of the School of Business Administra-

tion have been announced by Dr.
Charles S. Tippetts, dean of the
School.

Reginald V. Hobbah. instructor in
commerce last semester, is spending
the second semester at Iowa State
College as an instructor in transporta-
tion. He is expected to return next fall
to resume his courses in transportation
at the University. Meanwhile, his
courses in this subject will be taught
by  J. Dowling, a graduate of
the University. Mr. Dowling received
a degree of science upon graduation
from the School of Business Adminis-
tration in June, 1934. He was a stu-
dent in the Graduate School last year,
when he earned his master’s degree.

A new instructor in economics,
Paul |Howell, has also been added to
the faculty. Mr, !Howell is teaching
some of Mr. Hobbah’s classes and al-
so some of the classes of Dr. Carroll
R. Daugherty, professor of economics,
who has been granted a leave of ab-

‘ s‘e'n‘ce to direct‘ ‘an ‘impo‘r‘t‘ant‘*proj’ect“’

for the United States Department of
Labor. Mr. Howell is a graduate of
VVa.shington University and holds a
master’s degree from that school. He
spent a year in graduate work at
Harvard University, and comes to
the University from the Works Pro-

gress Administration in Washington,

D. C., where he served as a research
associate.

Dr. Daugherty’s course in personnel
administration at the Downtown Divi-
sion of the Unversity is being con-
ducted this semester by Carl Coler,
formerly director of education courses
at the Westinghouse Electric and
Manufacturing Company.

The course in air transportation,
taught last year by Dr. Marion K.
McKay, is now under the direction of
Claude  Puffer, instructor in eco-
nomics. This course is primarily for
students in aeronautical engineering.
Its purpose, according to Mr. Puffer,
is “to give students an idea of what
they face iii the economic line rather
than in the engineering line.” Includ-
ed in the subject matter are studies of
rate making, ﬁnances of air transpor-
tation companies, and public utilities.

Tickets Available
For Next Series

Gf Artistic Films

The movement for artistic, tech-
nically important moving pictures is
scoring a country-wide success as
the ﬁne arts department here plans
its second showing for Monday.

A full house jammed the ﬁrst series
at an admission price of one dollar
at a showing in Hartford, Connecticut.

The exhibition sponsored by the
ﬁne arts department Monday evening
at 8:15 o’clock in the Falk Elemen-
tary School auditorium will be free
to students.

Tickets may be obtained now in
the ﬁne arts office, Room 109, State
Hall.

The second series, “The Rise of the
American Film (1912-15),” includes:
“New York Hat,” with Mary Pickford
and Lionel Barrymore, directed by
D. W. Griffith (1912); “A Fool There
Was,” with Frank Powell and Theda
Bara (1914); “The Fugitive,” with
VVilliam S. Hart (1915); and “The
Clever Dummy,” a Mack Sennett com-
edy (1915).

“These ﬁlms make their appeal to
the sophisticated movie-goer; they do
11ot attempt to compete with the pop-
ular commercial products,” says
Walter R. Hovey, professor and act-
ing head of the department.

Going!‘ Going!

For those students who missed
their ﬁrst opportunity of purchas-
ing a Journeyman, University lit-
erary publication, a limited number
of copies will be on sale during
fourth hour today on the ﬁrst
ﬂoors of the Cathedral and Alumni
Hall, and on the second floor of
State Hall. The price is 25 cents.

Boivrnan Replies
To Earle’s Move

“or5.‘1:‘a§‘:"nniversity’:s“ Suggestion 

Was Ignored By Governor

“The University will not be forced
to discontinue if the state appropria-
tion is no-t forthcoming,” stated Cl1an-
cellor John G. Bowman yesterday in
reply to the threat of Governor George
H. Earle that he would recommend a
stoppage of the University's. state ap-
propriation unless certain “liberaliz-
ing” measures were ta.ken here.

The Chancellor asserted that he
would be much concerned if the Uni-
versity, because of the discontinuance
of state aid, would have to “offer no
more -free tuition, cut down on the
faculty, and drop a few thousand stu-
dents.”

Governor Earle, in a letter to George
H. Clapp, president of the Board of
Trustees, V/ednesday, stated that he
gave the University until March 1 to
effect a reorganization of the Board
to include alumni and state represen-
tatives, and insure some security of
tenure for the faculty.

“We would be glad to have the
Speaker of the House and the Presi-
dent of the Senate as ex-oﬁicio meni-
bers of the Board, but the Governor
has ignored this and wants to name
the members. \Ve don’t want that,
for we do not want to make the ap-
pointments a basket of plums. for
someones political advantage,” as-
serted the Chancellor.

Miss Thralls Gfanted
Leave For Semester

Miss Nora E. Zink To Teach Former
Instructor's Geography Classes

Miss Zoe E. Thralls, assistant pro-
fessor of geography at the University,
has been granted a semester’s leave
of absence, beginning this month, to
observe teacher training methods in
the normal schools and colleges in
Pennsylvania and other states.

Miss Nora E. Zink, who is complet-
iug her work for a cloctor"s degree at
the University of Chicago, will replace
Miss Thralls for the coming semes-
ter.

A Hoosier by birth, Miss Zink re-
ceived her Bachelor of Science de-
greefrom the University of Utah and
her Master of Arts degree from Co-
lumbia. During the summer of 1926,
she pursued courses in geography at
Oxford University, England. She has
a.so taken courses in education and
geography _at the University of Minne-
sota, Yale, and the University of Pitts-
burgh.

Both Miss Thralls and Miss Zink
will be members of the department
during the summer session, according
to Frank VV. Shockley, director of the.
University summer sessions.

lilo Unit Meetings

Because of the Panhellenic assem-
bly for freshman women at noon to-
day, there will be no meetings of the
freshman units this week. On Tues-
day evening, members of the fresh-
man council will meet informally at
a dinner-meeting in the Cathedral.

Sports And Sportsmen

OMORROVV EVENING the Panther basketball team

is going into a. game against Duquesne University as
the underdog. It must be admitted that not often is an
outﬁt representing Pitt an underdog in athletic competi-
tion. It must also be admitted that the spot is not such
a. bad one, for Dr. Carlson and his cagers may be relied
upon to make the most of whatever advantage is so im-
plied and sock it to the Dukes with everything they
have.

There is another aspect to tomorrow’s ball game i-n
which nobody will be an underdog, that is in regard to
the conduct of the spectators. Being played under the
conditions that it is, a basketball contest stands a much
bigger chance of being marred by actions on the part of
those watching than is the case in football or other forms
of competition where the rooters are rather far removed
from the scene of action.

Obviously the oﬂicials tomorrow night may make occa-
sional errors of judgment, for one side as well as the
other. A chorus of boos on our part would lead only to
a return chorus from the opposition rooters when the oc-
casion aros-er, all of which doesn't make it easier for any
of the boys out there on the ﬂoor to play a good ball
game.

It must be considered as a tribute to the two schools
that despite the white heat intensity at which the past
games have been played, there have been no serious out-
breaks of bad feeling between players or spectators.
Particularly since we are Duquesne’s guests tomorrow
night, we should make it our business to maintain that
record. ‘

Another Class——-Another Chance
NOE .-\.GAII\* the green armbands and the green but-
tons are popping up here and there around campus.
It :ne‘s.ns that we have with us the first contingent of the
class of 1940.

The idea of passing into a new decade appears now as
something strange, but the fact that freshmen entering
the University this semester :1.ren’t going to graduate
until the calendars hit the forties shouldn’t make us any
the less anxious to help them get the proper start here.

Entering a school in February must be something akin
to jumping out of the grandstand and entering a race as
the procession goes whizzing by on the track. Of course,
this has not proved much of a handicap to hundreds of
students who l1a.ve done it. You will ﬁnd few of these,
however, who will not be conscious of :1 deep gratitude
toward those of the runners who checked their full stride
to offer some help to the newcomers.

Among the new entrants are 23 who have won honor
scholarships by distinctive high scho-ol work, these al-
ready have a high standard to maintain. They, and all
the others__ will eventually make their ways into various
groups and activities of the University. Our time is not
too short but that we can assist in offering these people
a means of making those transitions both more rapidly
and more happily than they would otherwise be made.

Chick Davies’ Dukes Enter City Title Game As Favorites;
Both Coaches Plan To Start Second String Teams

 

By William

K. Trosen

The long—awaited ultra-ultra spectacle of the district college bas-
ketball season, the Pitt-Duquesne game, ﬁnally steps into the sport
spotlight tomorrow night when Coach Chick Davies brings his famed
Dukes out to the Stadium to meet Dr. Carlson ’s Panthers.

At present leading the parade
be out to strengthen their hold on

for tl1e city title, the Dukes will
ﬁrst place honors. In fact, all of

the elements possible for a headlining basketball game will be present
tomorrow night: two city rivals, two ﬁery coaches, two exceptionally
ﬁne teams, and a past record that promises thrills aplenty.

Tomorrow night’s battle will mark¢
the eighth showing of the Panthers
against the Dukes. The downtown
boys have taken ﬁve of the seven but
every game has been close. In the
initial game the Dukes won, 28-21,
following this up with three straight
one—poil1t victories, 26-25, 25-24, and
30-29. Here, the Panthers stepped in
for their ﬁrst win, 31-29, two years
ago. Last season, the two teams split,
the Dukes winning the ﬁrst, 27-25;
the Panthers taking the second, 35-34.

Davies brings his Dukes to the Sta-
dium with a ﬁne record of ten vic-
tories in 11 starts. They lost only
to Long Island U. by a 36-34 score a
few weeks ago. In the 11 games, the
Duquesne ﬁve has averaged over 50‘
points a game and has been hailed at
times as being the “perfect team.”

In comparison, the Panthers have
dropped ﬁve of their 17 games thus
far, something unusual for a Carlson
team. Lately, however, the Cats have
pepped up, winning their last four
games against West Virginia, VVest-
minster, Penn State, and Navy by lop-
sided margins. If the Panthers keep
going like this and the Dukes keep up
their good work, the roof of the Sta-
dium will have to be nailed down to-
morrow night.

As usual Davies will start his sec-
ond string ﬁve against the Panthers,
saving his iirst team until later in the
game. Starting the game will be Air-
hart and O’Malley at forwards, Fort-
ney- at center, and Malackney and
Neiderberger at the guards. The
first stringers show co-Captain Walt
Miller and Mike Dresmich at the for-
wards, Big Ed Kweller at the cen-
ter position, and Herb Bonn and
Pickles Kreiling playing opposite the
Panther forwards.

Pitt Reserves To Start

Bonn and Kreiling have been the
mainstays on the Duke varsity and
invariably one or the other, leads the
scoring. Herb, a. junior, specializes in
long shots and drops them in from
all angles. Pickles, one of the two
sophomores holding down a varsity
job, is an all-around player.

Not to be outdone by Davies, Dr.
Carlson will also start his second
team, a combination that has Miles
Zeleznik and Frank Loucks at the for-
wards, Pete Noon at center, and Rags
Radvansky and Luke Rowe at guards.
On his ﬁrst-team, the good doctor will
send forth Ted Roderick, Bill Jesko,
Joe Garcia, Bob Johnson and Ed Spot-
ovich to do battle with those pesky
Dukes. ,

Pete Noon, slated to see action wit
the second team, will also probably be
one of the varsity ﬁve. Pete’s size
a.nd recent ﬁne playing will be needed
against the Dukes and more specifi-
cally, against the Dukes high jumping
center, Ed Kweller.

In the preliminary game, the fresh-
man teams of Pitt and Duquesne will
meet. Coach Docky Kowallils had his
team’s victory streak stopped by West
Virginia but aims to start another one
against the little Dukes. Usually, the
frosh teams get into the spirit o-f the
thing and put on just a.s exciting a
game as the varsities.

The probable lineup:

Pitt Position Duquesne
Zeleznik .. .  . . . .F . . . . . . . . . . Airhart

Loucks . . . . . . . . . .F . . . . . . . . O’Malley

Noon . . . . . . . . . . . .C . . . . . . . . . Fortney

Rowe . . . . . . . . . . ..G . . . . . .. Malackney

Radvansky . . . . . . G. . . . Neiderberger

Time of game—8‘ o'clock.

Cats Swamp Navy, 42-20

Final exam worries didn’t seem to
bother the Panther varsity, for on the
day after the ﬁnals were over, they
swamped the Navy cagers, 42-20, at
Annapolis last Saturday afternoon.
01' maybe ﬁnals did bother the Golden
Cats, and they proceeded to take ven-
geance on the Navy.

Whatever the case may be, the
Panthers put on one of their season’s
best shows in downing the Navy.
Billy Jesko led the scoring columns
by sinking six baskets for a total of
12 points. Not fa.r behind came Ted
Roderick with 11 points to take sec-
ond honors.

At the half the Panthers led, 21-11, A
and they maintained almost the same
superiority in the ﬁnal half by out-
scoring the Midshipmen, 21-10.

After two straight setbacks, Coach

Penn State has been undefeated in

this year's outﬁt seems to be uphold-
ing the record. In their last appear-
ance the wrestlers trimmed Temple

Pitt's team was strengthened dur-
ing the mid-semester vacation with
the return to competition of Bernie

was a letter winner last season.

Probably the outstanding match on
the evening's program will be be-.
tween Captain Bedillion of Pitt and
Jack Light of State. Light holds the
intercollegiate title in the 135-pound
class.
