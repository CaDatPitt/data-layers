16-O decides it: Pitt will divest

VOLUME EIGHTY-ONE, ISSUE NINETY-ONE

By Frances Sansig
News Editor

The University of Pittsburgh
will have no investments in South
Africa by Dec. 31, 1988..

A 16-O vote with one absten-
tion resolved a 10-year-old dis-
pute between supporters of
divestment and Pitt's board of
trustees, which, at a meeting May
28, adjourned because of disrup-
tion by anti-apartheid demon-
strators.

At last Wednesday's brief meet-
ing of the Executive Committee,
trustee William Gange, reading
from the resolution on university
investments in companies doing
business in South Africa, said,
”The university has adopted an
increasingly rigorous policy
toward investment in stocks of
American companies operating
in South Africa. ...”

Gange said it was clear that the
trustees recognized little progress
has been made in the dismantling
of apartheid. "I believe we must

strengthen even further our

divestment policies,” he said.
A resolution was passed that

Pitt completely divest stockhold-

ings in American companies that

by March 31, 1988, have not ef- -

fectively begun withdrawl from
South Africa and that the divest-
ment is to be completed by no
later than Dec. 31, 1988.

Trustee Mary Jane Mitchell
Page, who abstained from the
vote, asked Pitt President Wesley
Posvar if it was necessary to wait
until 1988 to divest. 4

Posvar responded by saying
that compared to other institu-
tions that have opted to divest,
”this is actually a very short time
table. J ~

'’I think the university has be-
haved very responsibly,” said
Posvar. "The public statement
conveyed by this. action is
meaningful.”

He maintained Pitt's policy
”has been unswervingly anti-
apartheid" and discussed the pos-

The Black Action Society's

response to the university's re- -
cent decision to divest is one
of bitter relief, according to
BAS executive assistant Iskan-
dar Jones.
I ”I don't think the university
should have invested in South
Africa in the first place," Jones
said. ”The trustees’ hearts
were sufficiently hardened to
not pay much attention to the
issue until recently.”

The university's decision to
divest, Jones said, is a product i
of the many years of effort and
hard work for the BAS. "It’s
been a long, hard battle,” he
said. "The divestment has fi-

nally prevailed."
His analogy ‘of the divest-

ment situation characterizes .

his overall feelings: ”It’s like
putting a knife in someone’s
back and then taking, it out and
saying, ‘Aren't you happy I
took it out?’ ”

The chairman of the depart-
ment of black eduacation,
research and development,
Dennis Brutus, completely

supports and congratulates the ‘

university's decision. ”Of
course I'm very pleased with
the decision,” he said. ”It will
enhance the imageof the
university enormously both
nationally and interna-
tionally.” , .

Brutus’ only qualm is that he
thinks the university should

accelerate the process of
divestment to an earlier date
Student Goverment Presi-

‘dent Phil Moyer also ex-

pressed support for the
decision to divest. "I'm
pleased to see that the univer-
sityhas divested,” Moyer said.

"The decision made was one ‘

that was very thought out —
not made in haste. That's prob-

ably what I respect most about '

the decision.”

According to Jones, the uni-
versity was pressured into
making the decision to divest.
”They’re doing it because they
anticipate a house bill which

calls for divestment," he said._

Jones said public opinion on
the subject also affected the
university's decision. -

May 31, 1986 — About 50 protestors march to Pitt President Wesley Posvar's home chanting, ‘

North says he h

By Harry F. Rosenthal

Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON Lt. Col.
Oliver North, a take-no—guff wit-
ness trumpeting his devotion to
the Nicaraguan rebel fighters,
said Tuesday he had assumed
President Reagan had approved
his efforts to divert Iranian arms
sales profits to the cause.

But, he said, ”No memoran-
dum ever came back to me with
the initials from the president.”

And he said that on the day Rea-

gan fired him, the president told

- him on the telephone, ‘'1 just
‘didn't know.”

”I never carried out a single
act, not one, in which I did not
have authority from my superi-

ors,” North said with barely con-'

trolled anger. ”I have not in the
23 years that I have been in
uniformed service violated an
order, not one.”

. North's testimony was the most
sought—after in the congressional
Iran-Contra hearings to date, and
it lived up to its advance billing.
His more than six hours in the

   

witness chair was punctuated by
sharp exchanges with committee
counsel John Nields, and be-
tween North's lawyer and the
committee chairman.

Speaking with fervor, North
said ”thank God” that there were
people willing to help the Con-
tras with money, ”and [that] the
Nicaraguan resistance didn't die
as perhaps some others in-
tended."

North contradicted the testimo-
ny of former National Security
Adviser Robert McFarlane that
McFarlane,had told his staff not
to solicit assistance from foreign
leaders for the Contras after Con-
gress had cut off U.S. aid.

”I never heard those instruc-
tions,” North said and added that
he once gave McFarlane a card
containing the number of a for-
eign bank account that could ac-
cept contributions earmarked for
the rebels.

Repeatedly, North told the
commhttees that he had been
conducting covert operations
whose details were not for the
American people.

— Oliver North

”There are boxes within box-
es to protect the operation,” he
said. Of secret documents being
aired in the hearings, he said, ’’I
pray to God you are not going to
turn those Ioose.”

North made no secret of the
fact that other countries, includ-
ing China — identified at the
hearing only as ”country No‘. 4"
— were asked to contribute to the
Contras. When he met with a
Chinese representative, North
said, he asked that the FBI keep
tabs so his meeting would not be
misunderstood.

But he denied strongly that he

solicited money himself. That
was not because of a congres-
sional amendment forbidding
official U.S. aid, he said, ”but be-
cause I understood there are
regulations against government
officials soliciting money.”

He also said he did not offer
meetings with the president or
tours of the Oval Office for con-
tributions. »

’’I had the approval of my su-
periors” and assumed they had
approval from Reagan concern-
ing plans for Iranianarms pay-
ments to help finance the rebels
fighting the Nicaraguan govern-
ment, he said.

Still, he quoted Reagan as say-
ing in a telephone conversation
last Nov. 25: "I just didn't know."
Reagan had fired North earlier
that day as an aide on the Nation-
al Security Council.

To a question about diversion
of the Iranian arms profits to the

rebels fighting the Nicaraguan-

government, North snapped:

”The only thing we did was

. The parking lot of the Civic Arena was literally trans-
formed into a marketplace before the Gratetul Dead
concert — tood (including vegetarian chili), tie-dyed
t—shirts, and crocheted bracelets were tor sale. Out-
side entertainment was tree, though.

They're back. And they're
on your back, too.

Tie—dyed T-shirts have
returned for an era of neo—
hippyism. They say, like snow-
flakes, no two tie-dyes are
alike. But these days, they've
got tie-dyed shorts, hats and
just about everything else you '
could dream of. Tied and true,
no dye-hard T-shirt fan would
be caught dead wearing the
things. But fans of those shirts
of the psychedelic variety
would probably wear them
anywhere, and surely, they
would even be caught dead in
them — Grateful Dead, that is.

Kelly Knepper, assistant
manager of Truly a Treat be-
low the Essex an Meyran

Avenue, said the best. reason ‘

she can think for the revitali-
zation of the tie-dyed T-shirt is
the return of the Grateful
Dead.

’’I can't keep them in the
store,” she said, noting that
there was "a ‘last-minute rus_h
before the Dead concert Mon—
day night.

Knepper said she doesn't
particularly like the shirts.

’’I think they're awful.”

Well, considering that over
15,000 fans went to see Jerry
Garcia perform with his band,
it seems she's probably in the
minority. _

er power? ‘ ‘

tackling the challenges presented
by the deadly virus — how to
cure the disease and, at the same
time, attempting to ward off me-

increasingly numerous protests
and other AIDS-related inci-

Pitt/\lDSresearchers proceedwit-ii caution  

bor the virus. .

Of the 1,097 health care work-
ers whose skin and mucous
membranes were exposed to
contaminated blood (90 percent
of them exposed to the virus by
accidental needle punctures)
onlyone individual converted to
positive, a 0.3 percent infection
rate, said Gupta, quoting from an
article about the Centers for Dis-
ease Control.

In addition to this, of the 70 .

health care workers who were ex-
posed to patients’ open wounds
and 58 workers whose mucous
membranes were-exposed, none
of the 82 workers tested convert-
ed to positive.

This is not to say that individu-
als who work with the virus
should not take many precau-
tions, but even from the accidents
that occur, only very small per-
centages show positive test
results. Testing positive for the
AIDS virus does not mean an in-
dividual has the syndrome or will

.get it, only that the virus is present
in their system. It is possible to .

harbor the virus and show no visi-
ble symptoms.
Anita Winkels, a research assis-

'tant in Dr. Gupta’s laboratory,

said it is important to maintain
rigid standards for safety in the
laboratory. Hershel Boyd, main-
tenance worker for the retrovirus
laboratory, agrees that there are
important safety’ measures when

working‘ with the HIV. V

”The men responsible» for
scrubbing and waxing the lab
floor nolonger want to do the job
because of the recent freak inci-
dents with AIDS contamination,

and in general, people around ,

here are just being careful,” said
Boyd. ,
According to Dr. Charles Rinal-
do, principle investigator for the
Pitt Men's Study, staff researchers

‘were well informed of the tasks

they would be undertaking be-
fore they were hired.

”We work in specially
designed labs and ventilated
rooms, wearing plastic gowns, la-

- tex gloves and using only plastic '

labware to prevent glass break-
age,” said Rinaldo. ”[We take

'  precautions] more than is consi-
' dered to benecessary."

As scientists, Rinaldo said the.

researchers are excited about
their work and ”discover new
things every day.” Rinaldo is also
the associate professor of pathol-
ogy and infectious diseases and
microbiology at the School of
Medicine and‘Graduate School of
Public Health.

Amid heated controversy, President Reagan has nominated
Robert Bork to the newly-vacated position on the Supreme Court

bench.

There are those in the Senate, led by Edward Kennedy, who
claim that, should Bork be confirmed, the high court will be
pushed back 50 years to a time when ”women would be forced
into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at segregated lunch-
counters” and "school children could not be taught about evo-

lution.”

Those are strong claims, and they speak of a deep-rooted dis-
like for Reagan's choice. It seems important to remember,
though, that Reagan has constitutional power to appoint
whomever he pleases. Robert Bork, who has spent time teach-
ing law at Harvard, served on the U.S. Circut Court of Appeals
and worked in the Justice Department, is certainly qualified for
the position. There is every reason to expect that he would be

a fair justice.

If Bork’s record of previous rulings and his politics are a bother
to enough senators, he won't be confirmed. It is the Senate that
is supposed to voice the opinion of the people, and if the peo-
ple are displeased, we should turn to our senators, rather than
Reagan. They are our only voice in this process.

I.E'I"l'ER

The burden of
proof lies heavy

As Jimmy Breslin stated in
1974 after Watergate, ”politi-
cians will never find anything too
small not worth stealing.” Phil
Moyer, president of the Student
Government Board, is a casein
point. ‘

Your article on Wednesday,
July 1, leaves many questions un_-
answered about this supposed
misuse of funds. First, is the check
sent to the SGB by Delta Tau Del-
ta fraternity verified? (|t’s not that
Moyer is lying, but he must prove
his point.) Second, what is the
Office of Student Activities’ role
in all of this matter? Are they not
involved in this major error

regarding school funds? And last, .

Luke Kluchko is definitely in the
wrong to be a consultant-to Del-
ta Tau Delta fraternity or Phil
Moyer. His past and current po-
sitions as SGB president, brother
of Delta Tau Delta fraternity and
OSA adviser present a conflict of
interest.

As Richard Nixon proved a

time ago, nobody is above the
law, Pitt rules or federal laws. I
want to‘ believe that nothing is
wrong. However, Phil. Moyer
must first clarify this issuewith a
public" statement. It will be an an-
nouncement that might keep him
from the ”Nixon Syndrome.”

So Pitt's board of trustees has
finally succumbed to peer
pressure.

Pitt's total divestment will do
nothing" to helpthe oppressed
peoples of South Africa. Nothing.
Zilch. Zip.

But now we are morally in the
right —— or so we havebeen led
to believe. We supposedly made
a moral statement to the world.

But will this statement be‘ heard
thoughout the overcrowded jails
of South Africa? No. The racism
and political oppression willnot
be lessened because we took
money out of companies who do
business in that country.

Total divestment can accom-
plish one thing only; it will clear
our conscience of the myth that

This year marks the 20th an-
niversary of the Summer of Love,
a brief hiatus in the numbing
American Dream.

It was a time when a huge por-

tion of America learned that their _

music was a rallying point, some-
thing a crowd could hold in com-
mon, a peaceful place to try to
understand the madness around
them. 5

There are a good many people
who like to claim that older
bands, the Dead for instance, are

merely cashing in on a hazy, tie- .

died memory, that they are noth-
ing more than dinosaurs who
didn't have the good taste to die
when society changed around
them.

I just wish those people could‘
have been at the Civic Arena
Monday night. I wish they could
have seen 13,000 or so people
dancing together, not self-
conscious, some, admittedly, not

supporting apartheid.

As Pitt President Wesley Posvar
said at the board of trustees meet-
ing last Wednesday, selling 20 or

30 shares of stock in a company I

won't do a thing for the people
‘of South Africa. It will just make
us feel like we are on the right
side of history.

Granted, an American univer-
sity thousands of miles removed
from Africa can't change an en-
tire system of government. But if
Pitt really wanted to help the sit-
uation, it could help individuals
in South Africa.

0 Pitt could provide more
scholarships to South African
blacks, providing blacks with the
means to combat apartheid the
only way possible — through
education of the people. (In the

last two years, the university has .

sponsored the education of a

' number of blacks from South

Africa.) _

0 The board of trustees could
implement a program conceived
by Pitt professor David Platt, in

could have seen thetguy at the

Teen suicide rising

By Tarun Reddy

Staff Writer

A University of Pittsburgh
professor claims that-the sui-
cide rate among those aged 15
to 19 has tripled over the past
quarter century. Dr. David A.
Brent of Western Psychiatric

'‘ Institute and Clinic, along with

.
I

Allegheny County Coroner
Joshua A. Perper, conducted a
study with a grant from the
National Institute of Mental
Health.

Using death certificates of
children from the ages of 10 to
19 from 1960 to 1983, the
researchers found the suicide
rate doubled, even when a
change in the techniques used
to report suicides was used.

A sharp increase was found

among white males, ages 15

jumped from 6.47 per

The number of suicides that
employed firearms increased
by more than two and a half
times, according to the study.

”Alcohol was thought to be
the main cause of teenage sui-
cides until recently, when tests
were created to detect the
presence of marijuana in the
blood system,” said Brent.

Researchers note the rate of
suicide is parallel to the

domestic sales and production
of firearms.

BEIRUT, Lebanon — Kidnap-
pers of American hostage Charles
Glass released on Tuesday a
videotape showing Glass saying
he was a spy for the Central In-
telligence Agency.

However, the White House
said it was disregarding the tape
because Glass was coerced by his
kidnappers into saying he was a
spy. The White House said Glass
had no connections to any U.S.
intelligence agency and denied
he was a spy.

Glass had worked as a report-
er for ABC and is best known for
interviewing the hijackers of an
American jet on live television.

my main job with the CIA,” Glass
said on the tape. ’’I used my

“Shakespeare passe

By Erika Helbling

Staff Writer

Cyrano de Bergerac lives.

Edmond ‘Rostand’s arrogant
swashbuckler with the wounded
soul has been resurrected by
Canadian actorlay Brazeau at the

 Stephen Foster Memorial Theat-

er in this year's second produc-
tion‘ of the Three Rivers
Shakespeare Festival.

Rostand’s p|_ay centers around
the long-nosed, physically unat-

Vttractive Cyrano who wields his

sword with the same dexterity as

his words. Scorned and scoffed at ‘-

because of his nose, he develops
.an array of verbal retorts to avert
the psychological blows.

Butif the attack is severe, he
doesn't hesitate to use his sword
to defendhis dignity. .

Cyrano strikes right and left
against all that's false — social
pretense, prudery and self—serving
"falsehoods. However, he writhes
with loneliness rather than reveal-
ing his love for his beautiful cou-
sin Roxane. He fears her rejection

a continuous surprise. He ap-

Spaceballs is Mel Brooks’ latest

As usual, there is an abundance
of visual gags, puns and vulgar
jokes: Laser beams that target tes-
ticles, an animal named Barf and
a ”virgin alarm” on a droid are
a few examples of his gross
humor.

Several space movies are paro-

John Candy, usually a giant ta-

something more original.

Though Spaceballs is not for

Deadheads

bring their ,.

caravan to
Pittsburgh

By Mark Brown
Staff Writer

If you're going to see the Grate-‘

' ful Dead, go as a journalist. Bluff

your way past security, get as
close as you can to the stage and

‘enjoy yourself immensely — I

did.

Over 15,000 Deadheads
packed into a sweaty Civic Arena
Monday night to help the Dead
celebrate their 22nd year of mak-
ing people happy. It’s the first
time in two years that the Dead
played Pittsburgh, and folks came
from all over to enjoy the concert.

What is a Deadhead? Someone
who spends his every conscious
moment thinking about the
Dead. These people are the heart

. and spirit of a free America, and

they draw their spi ritual guidance
(no kidding) from Jerry Garcia
and Bob Weir.

They-were there, along with
yuppies, preppies, beer hippies
and some folks who looked like

}

they escaped. from the metha- .

done clinic. It's no secret; rather,
it's part of the mystique that the
Grateful Dead’s appeal is some-

.what based on hallucinogens.

First-set tunes included ”Roe
Jimmy,” ”Momma Tried” and
”So Far from Me.”

The second set was Dead
Heaven. ”Shakedown Street”

was quickly followed by ”Sam-.

son and Delilah,” and the au-
dience.’s adrenaline was further
sparked by an unusual combina-

tion‘ of a reggae version of ”Aiko -

Aiko” that was connected by
”Banana Boat" to ”Women Are
Smarter.”

A drum solo (more- like a duet,
as the Dead has two drummers)
and the inevitible ”Space” led to
a very mellow ”Knockin’ on
Heaven's Door,”_ then picked up
again with the classic ”Good

Love” and the encore ”Johnny B. _

Goode.” -

The Dead were backed up by
the reggae and blues group The
Neville Brothers from New
Orleans. The Neville Brothers ad-
ded a new vitality to the Dead,
giving the rock a more danceable
feel.

How's the band nowadays?
Solid. Jerry Garcia got off several
habit-forming hard drugs last
year, survived a near-fatal coma,
performed public service by

warning folks of the dangers of .

drug abuse and generally \

slimmed down. He still looks like
a teddy bear.

Bob Weir looks like he hasn't _

1 aged a day in 20 years and, for

unknown reasons, Brent cut his
hair.

NCAA findings much ado about nothing

By Tarun Reddy
Staff Writer

The NCAA concluded its special con-
vention in'Dallas last week with little in
the way of substantial reform as the de-
bate continues over ‘how its member
schools can reduce their expenses.

A major dilemma facing college football
programsthese days is the justification of
carrying so many scholarship players,
when less than half will see time on the
field.

A measure proposed to alleviate the sit-

uation by cutting—the number of NCAA

‘ school football scholarships awarded an-

nually from 95 to 90 was shot down,by
board members.
Pitt athletic director Ed Bozik defended

, the large number of scholarship players

NCAA football programs carry.

”One of the reasons why it is necessary
to carry so many players on the college
level is the fact that the players are not on
the same skill level as their professional
counterparts,” said Bozik.

Concerning basketball rosters, a
proposal that would have reduced the
number of basketball scholarships from 15
to 13 was also voted down.

Another question facing the NCAA is
the role college presidents play in the
direction of athletic programs.

"Our athletic department is in complete
coordination with the university adminis-
tration,” said Bozik. ”The role of the
university president should be to oversee
the compliance of the athletic department
with NCAA rules."

Dr. Ira Heyman, president of the

University of California at Berkeley, sug-
gested the elimination of all post-season
competition in football and basketball.

Bozik attempted to explain why Hey-
man made such a statement.

"Dr. Heyman was merely playing
devil's advocate in an attempt to stimulate
debate on the subject,” Bozik said.

Bozik doubted the idea was ever seri-
ously entertained.

One suggestion made at the convention
proposed the idea of tying the graduation
rate of an institution to the number of
scholarships it would be permitted to

,hand out. Bozik doubted the feasibility of

the proposal.

- ”In principle, it's a good idea, but the
different standards among the institutions,
as well as the possibility of individuals al-
tering academic records would seem to

make the plan a diffcult one to enforce.”

The president of the University of Ok-
lahoma pointed out that a successful ath-
letic program can generate a higher level
of interest in the cultural offerings of an
institution. . -

While the his statement was viewed by
many as being factious in nature, Bozik
believes sports are an important part of
society.

”Don't underestimate the value of a

football program,” said Bozik. "Our cul- '

ture is such that sports are an integral part
of the society. ‘ . _

”All in all, I don't feel the conference
was all that productive,” continued Bozik.
”Business such as this would probably be
served better by being dealt with at regu-
lar meetings, rather than at thesespecial
conventions."

though. I like to spend a lot of
time by myself,” Owens said.

this Pitt senior from Syracuse,
iv" N.Y., even for those consi-
I dered to be his closer friends.

Owens usually chooses
listening to music or exercis-
ing alone, in an out-of-the-way
place rather than socializing.

Owens, who will graduate
at the end of the summer ses-
sion, has already been accept-
ed into Pitt's graduate school
of business. —

”I like to think about things
a lot," said Owens. ”I like to
think about how far I've come
,_ and where I'm going. ‘I've
’ come a long way so far.”

It is difficult getting to know‘

No longer does Owens have A
to worry about where or when
he will be playing. He has
gained stability and satis-
faction. ,

_ Nobody has ever doubted
Owens’ talents; he is a swift,
strong, all-state running back
from Christian Brothers’
Academy in Syracuse. He
showed his ability, his fresh-

man year at Pitt, gaining I16 .

yards on 14 carries.
Problems arose for Owens
in the spring of 1984 and con-
tinued for the following two
years. Owens slipped and
sprained his knee in spring
practice and as a result missed
the entire season. A
He returned the‘ following,
season only to see Craig Hey-
ward, among others, ahead of
him‘ in the tailback position.
He was given a choice be-
tween not playing at all and
‘ playing as adefensive back.
That idea,‘ lasted about two
weeks during fall practice.
Heyward and Gladman were
injured, and Owens returned .
to his running back position.
Once Heyward and Glad-

Owens: Not really lonely

man recovered, Owens once .
again found himself searching
for a position. He moved back
to defense and, by the end of
the season was starting at
strong safety.

"It was frustrating,” Owens
said. ”When they putlme at '
running back, I thought I
showed them that I could do
the job. Then they putime at

ifreesafety, and I showed them

I could be effective in that po-
sition, also. They still switched
me_. But I always managed to
get into the game somehow, It

‘kept me hungry.”

John Fox became the secon-
dary coach last year. He liked
what he saw in Owens and
kept him as a strong safety for
the entire season. Owens had,
at last, gained security.

Strong safety is not the most
attention—grabbing spot on the
team, not like running back or‘-
even free safety, but Owens

‘managed to add excitement

where excitement is not often

‘ found.

How's a backfield of Craig and

The only difference this year is
that the game will not be at Pitt

Congemi injures back again

By Christopher Sepesy

Sports Editor

F_ormer University of Pittsburgh
quarterback John Congemi has
again suffered another setback
due to back injuries.

Congemi, a back-up quarter-
back for the Toronto Argonauts in
the Canadian Football League,
broke two lumbar vertebrae dur-
ing a game July 4. This is the
same type of injury he sustained
last fall while playing for Pitt
against the Syracuse Orangemen
Nov. 1.

However, according to doc-
tors, the injuries do not seem to

be related in terms of seriousness.

His injury seems to have come
at just about the same type of op-
portune moment as it did when

he was playing for Pitt. With only _

two games into the season, Con-
gemi is currently ranked second
in the league in passing.

Congemi reportedly threw an
intercepted pass when a player
from the opposing team rushed
and struck him in the head caus-
ing him to fall. This player then
fell on top of him, landing on
Congemi’s head. _

’’It was an obvious breach of
good sportsmanship, at least in
our eyes,” said Toronto public re-

Winnipeg's coach Michel Riley
has already said of Congemi, ”He
has shown a lot of poise in these
first two games and should al-
ready have proven a good basis
for his career.”

Congemi is the back-up passer

‘for Danny Barrett, who, in a re-

moved sense, is also connected
with Pitt.

Barrett is the former quarter-
back for the University of Cincin-
