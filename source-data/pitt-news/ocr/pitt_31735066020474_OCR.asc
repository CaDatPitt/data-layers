Mondale
talking  
tough

By Vincent Murphy
The Pitt News

A crowd of 15,000 gathered in
Market Square on Wednesday after-_

.-noon to listen to the promises of a

presidential candidate with a new
image. As former Vice President
Walter Mondale directed blows at
the Reagan presidency and concen-
trated on the deficit, jobs and for-
eignimports, everyone from steel
workers to foreign news correspond-
ents assembled. Unison shouts of
“Mondale!” broke out between
aggressive statements from the
podium.‘

The announcer for the local

Democratic campaign happily-

stated, “This is right upthere with
one of the biggest crowds.”

Only two, days after a successful
televised debate, a large turn-out for
a Mondale convention in a notably
Democratic city such as Pittsburgh
might be expected. The numbers,
though, were “twice the number we

thought could fit in ,here,-’~’..said-~the~_«

announcer. M .

Walter Mondale was l0lminutes
behind schedule when he ariived at
Market Square and walked confi-
dently to the podium -after an intro-
duction by Pittsburgh Mayor
Richard Caliguiri and an earnest
statement by Robert‘ Macey, an
unemployed steelworker. Signs dis-
playing “Mondale/ Ferraro” and
others attacking the Reagan presid-
ency, “Bedtime for Ronzo” and
“Raygun supports workers (Pol-
ish),” were cluttered above the heads
of the crowd. »

. The content of Mondale’s 45-
minute talk at Market Square was

_delivered effectively, but was per-

haps a bit surprising from a presi-
dential candidate. Mondale
effectively attacked the Republican
party. Matt Hawkins, a Democratic

‘campaign worker, said that he felt

Geraldine Ferraro’s function as vice
presidential candidate was to attack
the opponents? policies, “as opposed
to mutual criticism by the actual

-presidential candidates,” he said. ‘

Mondale’s victorious attitude after a
successful weekend debate, though,
made for an especially effective anti-
Republican approach aimed at the
blue collar workers of Pittsburgh.

' The candidate ignored many of
the major issues of his national
debate and concentrated on thetone

. set by unemployed worker Macey at

th_e beginning of the talk. The issue
of abortion was ignored completely,
and the issue of national defense and
foreign policy,_ that seems to be one
of the larger‘ strongholds of the
Democratic campaign nationally,
was barely discussed;

‘ Mondale got. right down to talk-

5 ing about jobs and social security to

Pittsburghers. “I’ll stick up for
Macey’s all over America,” he said,
with an immediate response of
cheers from the crowd. “I come from

a steel- workers state,” he said ’

proudly. “I'm a full-employment
Democrat.” The pep rally atmos-
phere intensiﬁed when he stressed
how much talent he felt was being

wasted as Reagan “Left the steel-—'
_industry to rust. We have the~most

talented work force in the world,”
Mondale said.

The major attack against Reagan
was made on the issue of, as Mon-
dale put it, “what he says and -what
he does.”

“Which Reagan do you believe?”

he implored, “The new Reagan or »

the old Reagan.” referring to what
the Democrats feel is a major change
in Reagan’s policies on the _national
deficit and social security since he
began" his campaign. Mondale
continued, “It’s not about cutting
birthday cakes, it’s about cutting
foreign steel imports." He also
accused Reagan of “cuddling up to
racists in South Africa.”

I Mondale left behind a crowd of
Pittsburghers who were probably
more optimistic than when they
arrived. A major change in demo-
cratic attitude? Maybe. The hecklers
and pro-Reagan demonstrators that

have marked the Democratic candi- .

date’s campaign didn’t seem inter-
ested in this Mondale appearance,
and the single “Vote Reagan” poster

‘in the Pittsburgh crowd on Wednes- .

day seemed very small.

Opponent’ s   scandals give l 
  rd party candidate hope

 

By Ana Opltz
The  News

Historically, Americans tend to
overlook third parties when voting,
but third party candidate Priscilla
Thomas is optimistic about her
chances to become state treasurer of
Pennsylvania. Thomas is a member
of Pennsylvania's only ballot-status
third party, the Consumer Party.

The Consumer Party believes that
the Democrats are no longer doing
anything to help the working class.
The Consumer Party wants to
represent the working class. Their
platform includes ‘full employment,
peace, justice and living rights.

The party began in Philadelphia_

16 years ago and is now the official
third party of Pennsylvania. This
election year, the Consumer Party is
running candidates for president,
vice president, state treasurer, audi-
tor general and attorney general.
Lance Haver, a candidate for au-
ditor general, joined Thomas on
Tuesday, Oct. 9, for a question and
answer program on public cable tel-
evision. The party has reached many
voters through talk shows, but more
often the‘ candidates can be found

among the working class, meeting
with voters on a one-to-one basis.

Thomas is a candidate who feels
she can identify with the people of
Pennsylvania. A native of Pitts-
burgh, Thomas is a 35-year-old
black woman —— an unemployed
welder with three children to sup-
port. She understands theposition
of the unemployed and the poor and
wants to improve living conditions
and benefits for them.

' Originally a Democrat, --Thomas
became disenchanted with theparty
when she found they did not go into
the black community to seek votes.
She joined the women's movement
and the peace movement and met
Liz Hughes who initiated her in-
volvement in the Consumer Party.
Hughes, is currently the press secre-
tary for the party. In 1983, Thomas
ran for county commissioner and
obtained over nine percent of the

votes, coming in fifth out of seven

candidates. .

The candidates have been on the
campaign trail all over Pennsylvania
for the last two months; they have

_ seen widespread unemployment and

poor living conditions with no end in
sight. Thomas’ solution to the high
rate of unemployment is to use
money generally given away by the
unemployment agencies to start new

businesses to provide jobs for the
unemployed. Thomas’ stand on
unemployment is unyielding, ‘‘If
they can put a man on the moon they
can certainly find people jobs.”

If elected, Thomas would institute
programs to restrain people and
make sure that state money is put
into the banks which will yield the
most interest. She is in favor of
lower utility bills and would lobby
the PUC hearings to institute
changes in favor of the consumer. In
addition to the state budget, funds
for programs to benefit the people
would be obtained from the military
budget cuts. In the opinion of the
party, money is invested into bombs
which we will hopefully never use.
This money could be put to a better
use by being funneled into programs
which would renovate broken down
dwellings and employ carpenters,
bricklayers, etc., while providing
adequate housing for the needy.

Thomas said she has taken a firm
stand on no-bid contracts. She also
said she is tired of the repeated find-
ings of corruption in government.
Both of Thomas’ opponents have
been investigated for corruption. ,

The Republican opponent, R.

Bud Dwyer, is currently under inves- ’ g,

“Without Christ, you will all go to
hell!" yelled a street-corner preacher
outside the William Pitt Union yes-
terday before the city police arrested
him and two of his colleagues.

The Bible-toting preacher, Jed
Smock, and his wife came to the Pitt
campus yesterday along with 30 stu-
dents from Free Gospel Bible Insti-
tute to spread the Gospel and teach
students about Jesus Christ, accord-
ing to Bible student Stephen Pyle.

The group met with strong oppo-
sition as an estimated 200 Pitt stu-
dents gathered to hear what Smock
had to say. Students jeered. Many
laughed at him. Several foreign stu-
dents, visibly upset, exchanged com-
ments with the preacher. “Lust!
Lust! Lust! Lust!” chanted many
jeering students. _

Student Activities director Wil-
liam Smith believes that the
preacher used his aggressive style of
speaking to get the attention of the
students. “The rhetoric they used
offended a great number of people,
though, and things got out of hand,”
he said.

The campus police arrived at the
scene because Smock and the others
were speaking on university prop-
erty. According to Smith, university
facilities can be used only by faculty,
staff, students and invited guests.
“They were not invited,” he said.

The police asked them to move,
and they did — right onto the side-
walk at the corner of Forbes Avenue

and Bigelow Blvd. Crowds of people

swarmed to the corner, many ﬂow-
ing into the streets. “This produced
an unsafe situation,” Smith said.
The Pittsburgh police came and
tried to disperse the crowd. The
police then asked Smock and his
friends to move to a different area,

but he refused and was promptly

arrested. Two others were arrested
soon afterward.

A Bible student asked one of the
officers what Smock was guilty of,
and the officer said, “We don’t
know, but we’ll find something-,”
accordingto Pyle. The police could
not be reached for comment con-
cerning this statement.

Smock . and the others were
released eventually, and». the Bible
students returned to the campus to
continue preaching for the rest of the
afternoon.

Pyle was upset with the whole
day. “It seems that whenyou walk
with a Bible, you get persecuted,” he
said. He found it hard to believ that
people can’t preach anymore in p b-
lic. “We were just exercising our
freedom of speech. This just shows
the kind of spiritual condition our
country is in".-”

The Pitt News, Friday, oerober I2, 1934 ;

Expert compares presidencies  

of Truman, FDR, Jefferson

Jennifer Benzing
The Pitt News

David McCollough, host of the
network television series “Smithson-
ian World,” spoke at Pitt Wednes-
day night and he focused on three
presidents; Thomas Jefferson,
Theodore Roosevelt and Harry S.
Truman. McCollough said that the
three presidents came into office in
“extraordinary periods in history.”
each having “extraordinary
responses to those times.”

He began thebiographies with
Truman, making a comparison
between Truman and this year’s
presidential candidates. He referred

to Mondale and Reagan as “two

Trumans” because of Mondale’s
remark that the elections were “ 1 948
all over again” and with Reaga_n’s
upcoming “whistle.stop" campaign
tour in which Reagan cited his inten-
tions to ride in the car once owned
by Truman himself.

Truman took office in April of
1945, immediately following the
death of Franklin Roosevelt during
World War II. During that time,
McCollough said, Truman unified
Roosevelt's Cabinet and addressed
the U.N. in its first session by radio.

“He was one of 13 vice presidents to
succeed to the presidency,” said
McCollough, and warned that we
must concern ourselves with the fact
that “a_ vice president,can become
president." -

He went on to say that all three
presidents were poor public speak-
ers. Jefferson was a gentleman, but
had no charisma and mumbled
when speaking to the public.
McCollough mentioned, however,
that Jefferson expressed himself

THE COMPLETE VAN GOGH

‘Impressive, large-format volume includes

works—2,l30 in all. Sketches, drawings
and finished paintings are organized in
chronological order to give the reader the
clearest possible understanding of the rela-.
tionships among ‘his various works. Van

brilliantly on paper, and was the
actual founder of the Democratic
Party. “Jefferson,” he said, “was the
first 18th century president to bring
us into the 19th century.”

McCollough said Roosevelt was
the most outgoing and charismatic
of the three, being the most popular
president ever up to that point.

All three presidents, he said, “had
an important quality in common in
that they each realized the impor-
tance of the pulpit as a place for
persuasion,” and that each realized

1 that “history is important in under-

standing the role of chief executive
office, and in keeping the country
informed as to what had happened
before.” Each of the three presi-

Ldents, he said, was involved in exten-

sive expansion. Jefferson, in his time
of office, acquired the Louisiana
Purchase, which more than doubled
the size of the country. Roosevelt
was involved in U.S. global expan-
sion in terms of the Panama Canal,
and the settling of the Russian-
Japanese War. Truman was respon-
sible for pushing the Marshall Plan
through Congress, and the use of the
atomic bomb.

Truman was unaware that the
bomb existed, said, McCollough,
until after he was sworn into office.
McCollough said, “Over half a mil-
lion people were involved in the
creation of the atomic bomb ...” and
yet Truman knew nothing about it.
Truman had decided to use the
bomb, but essentially the decision
had already been made by the
Roosevelt administration. “If we
had invaded mainland China,” said
McCollough, “we’d have lost a half a
million men.  The bomb was used
to end the war." McCollough con-
tinued by noting Truman’s accomp-
lishments of formulating the CIA

and desegregating the Armed
Services.
McCollough referred to the three
presidents as “career politicians,"
and commended them as having the
“keenest interest and closest aware-
ness of history in seeing their presi-
dencies in a large context and them-
selves as career politicians,” but that
“nothing in history could prepare us
for the period of the atomic bomb."
McCollough said that, throughout
our schooling, we are taught that
presidents are fine and noble people,
but that in reality “there are rela-

'tively few great presidents,”and that

each of these three great men really
were “well meaning devoted public
servants.”

Wrapping up the biographies,
McCollough mentioned the Truman
Committee, an appointed commit-
tee headed by Truman, to route out
inefficiency and corruption in the
Defense Department. “They had the
power to put people in jail,” said
McCollough. “They had teeth. 
Wouldn't it be nice to have such a
committee in the Senate right now?”

He went on to say we should
“soak up and enjoy far more than we
do. Anything we can do to support
 good works of history, is only to
the benefit of the community at
large. These are dangerous times.
History is our guide to navigating us
through in perilous times.  Every-
thing comes to us because of our
predecessors.” He said of the Rea-
gan administration, ‘‘It is fashiona-
ble to say that now we know it really
makes a difference who the presi-
dent is.” But, he said emphatically,

“It has always made a difference."

In his closing of the lecture,

McCollough said, ‘‘Let’s all care
about our vice president and presi-
dent. And for heavens sake, let’s all
go and vote.” ‘

University rapped foriinactions

     

on South African investments

By Alison Sterne
The Pitt News

"The university's position is mor-
ally indefensible. It is a slap in the
face to the university '5 black popula-
tion as well as anyone else who has a
conscience. "

The administration's lack of
action regarding the divestment of
university funds in South Africa was
the object of heavy criticism at the
Student Government Board meeting
yesterday.

Attention was brought to the issue
-by recent passage by the state House

of Representatives of a bill on the‘

subject. The bill was passed by a
landslide (180-9) and is now on its
way to the state'Senate.

Last year, a board resolution

approved plans for divestment even -

before the bill was introduced to the

House. The idea originally came
from Jan Medoff, a member of the
I978 SGB. '

After his initial condemnation of
the university‘s stand, Abrams went
on to support his claim that now is
the time for divestment. According
to Abrams, five-sixths of all South
Africans are black, yet they cannot
work, live where they choose, or
have any say in government.

The bill would force Pitt to divest
funds currently invested in South
African corporations. Failure to
divest these funds would result in a
freeze of all state aid to Pitt and
three other state universities
Temple, Lincoln and Penn State.

Pamela Hart, also a board
member, agreed with Abrams’
assessment of the university’s
position. 6

“The university’s involvement.in
South African corporations is mor-
ally equivalent to legalizing slavery
in the U.S.," Hart said. Medoff sub-
mitted a “report urging the board of

Dave Pikovsky of the SGB said,
“the lack of action says something
about the administration. It was
asked for in I978; it's 1984."

Another area of concern voiced
by Abrams was the buslane. Abrams
reported to the board that he had
attended a recent meeting concern-
ing the problem. According to
Abrams, PAT officials present told
those assembled of their plans for
the buslane.

PAT plans to look into physical
modifications of the buslane. There
is a possibility that the lane will be
expanded into two lanes. Also, there
havebeen route changes made so
that more buses will run on Forbes

Theft tops
crime list

By Kathleen Kashay
The Pitt News

Thett accounted for 17 of 26
crimes reported to the University
of Pittsburgh Campus Police
between Sent. 26 and Oct. 10,
1984.

According to James Watters,
assistant director of the public
safety department, “Every year it
[theft] accounts for about 40 per-
cent to 42 percent of all reported
criminal activity on campus."

Office equipment,. including
two computer keyboards, three
printers and one typewriter, were
the most commonly stolen items
during this period. The thefts
occurred in Thackery Hall and
Cathedral of Learning offices,.
none of which had been force-
fully entered.

Low- and high-speed hand
pieces, used by dental students,
ranked ‘second in number of
thefts. The waxing tools range in
price from $350 to $500 and were
all taken from unlocked cubicles
in Salk Hall.

During the same time span,
campus police arrested one indi-
vidual for burglary, two for crim-
inal attempt of theft and
possession of the instruments of
theft and two juveniles for

Disappointing harvest

‘by’ Todd Erkel

In Places In The Heart, writer/director
Robert Benton attempts to create a
detailed, textural portrait of small-
town Texas in the midst of the Great
Depression. The portrait is inhabited
by a group of characters — many
recollected from his own childhood —
who must deal with the realities of
those times.

The inescapable tragedy of the
period, awash in racial prejudice, eco-
nomic misery and disasters — both
human and "natural — surrounds
Benton’s story of survival in Waxa-
hackie, Texas, 1935.

That tragedy is presented but
never explored deep enough to evoke
any true concern. By the film's end-
ing —-— one of the more elusive in
recent memory — we know little of
how Benton’s folk feel about the
notion of white killing black_ for
nothing more than hateful revenge
or what it feels like to face financial
collapse.

From the time Edna Spalding’s hus-
band — the town's sherrif -— leaves
the dinner table and is killed acciden-
tally by a drunk black, the film never
more than skims the lives of its char-
acters. When Edna (Sally Field) buries
her husband, she _buries all that was
secure in her young life. She is left
with two kids, 30 acres and a glimmer
of dignity. Her attempts to save all
three promises a struggle to suffer
through and rejoice in, but the film
permits us to do neither.

An itinerant black worker, Moze
(Danny Glover), arrives as Edna and
her sister are cleaning up after the
post-burial gathering. He needs work
and convinces Edna that planting cot-
ton might allow her to rescue the

farmland from foreclosure. Edna
later takes in a boarder — the blind
brother-in-law of the town banker —
as a way of biding time with her credi-
tors and earning a few extra dollars.
Together, Edna, her kids, the worker
and the boarder literally weather the
storm together, resisting threats
from the Klan and pressure from the
bank. I

‘They plow, they plant and they
pick until their fingers bleed trying to
make the farm payment. Benton
draws on the basic story of triumph
over hardship, of perseverance in the
face of destitution, but the fine acting
and the striking detail of set and cos-
tume design are lost in a storyline
cluttered with a throw-away subplot
and a lack of any character
development.

Benton spends entirely too much
screen time on an affair between
Ed‘na’s brother-in-law, Wayne
(played by Duval look-alike Ed Har-
ris), and the local school teacher
V.iola. Theiraffair adds nothing to
the story and fizzles out as myste-
riously as it appears. Like much of the
film, the entire existence of the sub-
plot becomes clouded in ‘Benton’s
‘puzzling close. A

More importantly, Benton fails to

flesh out the character of Edna,

whose will and caring form the basis
of the story. Despite a couple of
scenes in which she says she is lost
without her husband, a couple more
telling us she misses him and another
in which she reveals how much she
cares for her two adorable kids, the
script fails to provide convincing evi-
dence. While in better times those
emotions probably wlent unspoken,
this is supposed to be a woman and
family in crisis — a misfit crew pitted

Whose war is it anyway?

by Stan Thomas Wozniak

When Robert Altman was in town
for the premiere of Come Back to the Five
and Dime, jimmy Dean Iimmy Dean, he
spoke of having seen the play on
Broadway and how- he felt it would
make an intense film because of the
ability to use close—ups and flashbacks
more effectively. Seeing the emo-
tions close up, Altman thought a film
would be more compelling. Part of
that reasoning is what makes Nor-
man ]ewison’s A Soldier's Story (known
as A Soldier's Play off broadway) such a
high-powered film.

Master Sergeant Vernon C.
Waters (Adolph Caesar) is a black
man obsessed with -white mentality
and fighting a predominantly white
war. At the beginning of the film he
stumbles out of a bar, drunk, irra-
tional and beaten—up. His blood is liq-
uid hate and fear. He's murdered on
the side of a road. It's so intense you
can almost feel the bullets going

_ through him. '

In Washington, D.C., the Army

, (decides to investigate. They dispatch

‘Captain Richard Davenport (Howard

i E. Rollins, I12). much to the dismay of

the whites in the town who begin to
become anxious. You see, Davenport
is black himself. Many of the men at
the base have never_ seena black

; .nity.an;_l..pride._,_..  

officer. This is Louisiana in 1944 and
there's going to be trouble.

,Told essentially in flashbacks, A
Soldier's Story begins to play with the
ideas of who might have had it in for
Waters. Director Norman Iewison
spends just enough time on establish-

‘ ing the characters and the sequences

so A Soldier's Story moves at a relent-

less pace, like a perfect heartbeat-

Charles Fuller's screenplay (based on
the play which won a Pulitzer Prize)
is harrowing. Not a word is out of
place, as we hear the men of the 221st
talk about pride and prejudices.
These men are subject to criticism
because they are black, but there's
something triumphant in every one
of their hearts. (”Any man who don't
know where he belong got to be in a
whole lot of pain," one soldier says.)

Evoking resentment and wicked-
ness, Waters is despised left and right
in the film, It's a strong and calculated
performance reminiscent of Robert
Duvall’s troubled soldier in The Great
Santini. . .

Though the final scene in A Soldier's
Story 15 slightly unsettling, the film
deserves the applause it receives as
we leave the theater shaken by the
agility and poise these men demon-
strate not as blacks, not as soldiers,
but as Americans with a sense of dig-

 

against the threat of faceless power
that Steinbeck immortalized in Grapes
of Wrath.

The blind boarder, Mr. Will, played I

brilliantly by John Malkovich (hot
from stage success in True West and
"Death of a Salesman), emerges as the
most interesting and believable of the
film's characters. His scenes reveal
true human concern, such as when he
stumbles to the attic to rescue Pos-
som Spalding from the tornado winds
or when he confronts the Klansmen
as they are attacking Moze in the
barn.

The film's most visually striking
sequences occur in the field: during
the plowing as Edna and Moze guide
their mules against the clear Texan
sky to the sound of a banjo number
titled ”Cotton-Eyed Joe,” and later in
the picking scenes, where the shot

begins tight on the fingers of Edna’

and then pulls back to reveal the
enormousness of 30 acres in bloom.
Benton effectively scores the film
with a reoccurring train whistle and
plenty of Texas—style_jamboree.

 

Sally Field with Yankton Hatten ‘and Gennie. James in Places In The Heart

The paradoxical relationship

between racial hatred and religious .

fervor present now and then in much
of the south is suggested by the fre-
quent shots of the town steeple and
the echoing of church bells.

Benton has managed to bring to life
the faded images of his past with feel-
ing in Places In. The Heart, but those
images never evolve into a recogniza-
ble whole.

Places In The Heart provides an enjoy-
able glimpse of ‘a period and a way of
life much less outdated than the aver-
age urban dweller might think. But as
a compelling drama or an insightful
examination of the forces at work
either then or now, the film ulti-
mately fails. . ’

Still, it has been generally well-
received by critics and audiences
alike, which proves that choice of
intelligent films available today has
all but run dry. Compared to the
mind-rot cinema of Wild Life and The
Evil That Men Do, even a movie like
Places In The Heart —- little more than a
well-acted episode of The Waltons —
can appear to be a vision of greatness.

by Jeffrey Sewald

"We don't -have anything anyone
would want. I don't even want what
we've got," proclaims elderly Thelma
Cates to her daughter matter-of-
factly with a flip of her hand. ’

Such is a sampling of the senti-
ments in Marsha Norman's Pulitzer
Prize-winning drama ‘night Mother, a
90-minute portrait "of ‘the darker

- corners of human nature currently in

production at Pittsburgh Public
Theatre. ’ .
The play is a detailed exploration of

the relationship between mother and
daughter. The main conflict? Daugh-
ter Jessie's carefully" calculated deci-
sion to commit suicide.

I I’ubl—ic Theatre's production,
directed by Peter Bennet, succeeds in
conveying the sense of urgency that
the subject matter would certainly
dictate. Suicide, even in the progres-
sive '80s, still remains a taboo subject
with the strings of morality and reli-
gious doctrine firmly binding it to the
mast of black and white issues.
Thelma Cates has been climbing that
mast all her life.

AI-INCIIS VIATAS

Stage and screen star of yesteryear
Sylvia Sidney sparkles in the role of
the‘ pleading mother, an aging but
persistent woman; She speaks not so‘
much of her will to live as she does of
her unwillingness to die.

”I like it here, and I'm going to stay
until they make me go!" she cries.
Unfortunately, her daughter Jessie
feels differently.

The troubled, though not irrespon-
sible, daughter is effectively por-
trayed by veteran New York and
regional ‘performer Sonja Lanzener,
who ably handles the complexity of
the character.

From the outset of the play, Jessie's
character comes on strongly. We
quickly learn of her suicidal plan, her
emotionally troubling epileptic condi-
tion, a failed marriage, strained fam-
ily relationships and a delinquent son
named Ricky.‘ Even in verbalizing
these problems, Jessie's character
sees no major gain in emotional
momentum. After apprising her
mother of her suicidal intentions Jes-
sie seems to relax. She has informed
her mother; the difficult part is now
behind her. From this point on, the
emotional tide of the play shifts
toward the mother.

Mother: (tearfully) I know my time is
coming. '

"Daughter: Yes, but you don't know
when, like a scary movie. -

Jessie's resignation to the futility 0
her situation is probably the most dif-
ficult pill to swallow, but you do, over
and over again — which speaks
highly of the acting but even more
profoundly of the writing.

Marsha Norman's dialogue
releases a powerful energy that is
controlled only by periodic quirky

1, points of view and witty lines that not

only aid the audience in their release
of tension but also help reveal the
divergent thought patterns of each
character.

Thelma and Jessie are rooting through a
box of ]essie's belongings. She pulls out her
watch and decides to leave it to her son Ricky.

Mother: He'll sell it.

 

  makes for plodding on.

Daughter: That's the idea. I'd like
to give him a good meal.
Mother: He'll buy dope with it.

Daughter: Then I hope he buys A

some good dope with it.

Question: With whom should your
sympathies lie? With Jessie, who has
calmly and rationally (yes, I mean
rationally) decided to end her life? Or
with Thelma_ an aging, seemingly
self-centered mother who appears to
dodge situations in lieu of recogniz-

.ing them? ’ .

The skill with which this mother]
daughter relationship is fleshed out is
impressive in that the natural mortal
clingings have all but left Jessie's
heart while they have consumed the
heart of her mother. Thelma resorts

The power of the play
manifests itself within the
strength of ]essie's argu-
ment in favor of suicide,
and the comparitively
weak case her mother

 
to the slinging of guilt first onto her
daughter, calling the talk of suicide a
cheap play for attention and an

"insult to the living," and then back-

onto herself. Did she not tell her

‘daughter things she had the right to

know? About her father? Her hus-
band? Her health condition?

The power of the play manifests
itself within the strength of Jessie's

argument in favor of suicide, and the

comparatively weak case her mother
makes for plodding on. In ’night
A/father, we witness a daughter's liber-
ation from her mother, the painful
splitting of a single being into two
individuals. The lengths to which the
woman must go in order to free her-
self are as frightening as they are
enlightening. .

"Jessie, forgive me. I thought you
were mine."

Looking for art that challenges our
traditional sense of time and space?
Look no further — the Mattress Fac-
tory gallery is featuring the work of
artists Meg Webster and James Tur-
rell. Odd as it sounds, the medium

' these artists use so well is space: the

moods and sensations of being in a

particular space, rather than the vis-

ual aesthetics. '
Webster's art is not quite architec-

_ture and not quite sculpture. Her

works. are artificial, self-contained

vworlds meant to be entered and

viewed ‘from both within and with-
out. She creates 'a‘mutual balance

_ between the forms,’ the materials and
h the process. The fydrpms.-are simple,

geometric shapes, such as cubes or

\ cylinders. The materials give her art

its unique quality, with each‘work
having its own mass, surface and tex-
ture. The -process of creating
becomes evident either in the build-
ing of the work or in the finished
product. . _
The exhibition ‘consists of three
walled enclosures constructed of hay,
wood and earth. The hay construc-
tion is a large, monolithic cube with a
walled castle turret. _The "wooden
construction is a tall, claustrophobic
booth. The last structure i_s a smooth,
almost mathematically precise ear-
then cylinder. Upon enteringone of

A these chambers, a sense of isolation

and -loneliness takes over as if the

A whole universe extends only sofar as '

timeand space

the structure's inner walls. All sense
of time and space is lost while
engulfed in these artificial worlds.

Also featured at the Mattress Fac-
tory, as their permanent installation,
is the art of James Turrell. Turrell
works strictly with light and space.
This artistic experience is a celestial
journey so elaborate and so complex
that you'll actually have to be guided
through. -

A dark, winding," lonely corridor

. leads to a room and Turrell’s first

work: a large purple square on the
one wall. But. there's much more
there than what seems — a surprise
that can only be realized by going and
seeing it yourself. The -other piece is
"meant for quiet meditation-. A com-

pletely dark hallway leads ‘upward to

a balcony with benches on either side
of the exit. Off in the distance,
beyond the darkness, is a slight,
barely visible spot of purple light. The
purpose is to sit, relax and meditate
on -the distant ﬂicker. After a while
the ﬂicker of light dances, changes
forms or fills one's whole vision with

« purple. After a few minutes, how-

ever, theexperience becomes all too
unsettling. Because of the sensory
deprivation, an all-pervading sense of
horror overcomes the visitor. This is

.-one of the most chilling experiences

you'll have at an art gallery.

more often? Not only will
an commuter know what is
going on around the campus
but he will also know if
there are any activities dur-
ing the week that he would
like to attend. In addition,
there will be a ”Commuter

Always remember not to
give up and make college life
a routine. Everyday at
school will be worth the
effort of getting there for all
commuters if they make the
university an exciting place
to be. Develop your talents
and share your interests
now while you have the
opportunity to do so. The

commuter’s school so do not
feel like you are in a minor-
ity if you commute. A com-
muter controls his college
life and he decides whether
the new inconveniences will

overcome the many possible _

advantages.

(Editor's note: Marcia Anstan-

dig is a past president of the Com-

comprised of so many com-
muters, why is it so difficult
for many student to feel at
ease with commuting to and
from Pitt? Are commuters
at a disadvantage over resi-
dent students when it
comes to fully taking advan-
tage of college life?

It is not difficult to obtain
an undergraduate degree at
Pitt and at the same time
make only a couple of
friends and never really
become active in even one of
the many groups on cam-
pus. In fact, there are stu-
dents who spend so much
time each day worrying
about where to park at
school, where to eat lunch
and how to beat rush hour
on the way home that they
never do anything besides
attend ‘ classes. There are
ways to solve this problem.

First, a commuter should
recognize that pitt offers a
diverse list of opportunities
for him and that the univer-

would benefit from his
membership, he could
request information from
the Office of Student Activ-
ities, New Student Pro-
grams or the Commuter
Association.

The Freshmen Activities
Fair during late August was
the first time during the col-
lege career that a student
can fully visualize his many
opportunities on campus.
Remember, it is not so much

. the work a student does is a

group, which is important,
but it is the number of peo-
ple a student can come in
contact with during college
that could really count.

It is easy to become
involved with the people at
Pitt. The most convenient ‘
way is to talk to classmates.
A new friendship could
come from sharing class
notes or from studying with

other commuters for
exams. .

the problem here's some
information you should
know.

Free parking spaces may
be found in Schenley Park
near Phipps Conservatory
and on the back roads
around the Golf Course.)
Residential areas near (and
not so near) the campus
have streets without
meters. Metered parking is
available on the streets _near
campus with the heaviest
concentration in the lot
between Hillman and Car-

I By Laura Murcko _ -

When the bandit saves an
unsuspecting commuter, a
Bandit ticket similar to this is
left on the windshield in place
of the real thing..

Due to financial reasons, the
bandit can not be out every day
with quarters, but will strike

at, least eight’ times this fall ‘

term. Future warningsof the
Bandit’s, appearances will be
placed in The Pitt News. If the
Bandit happens to save you,

THE BOOK OF RUNES
By Ralph Blum
St. Martin's Press

To the Ouija board, tea leaves, hor-
oscope and tarot cards, add runes — a
set of 25 small, flat stones marked
with ancient alphabetic symbols and
used as ,a form of oracle since the
Vikings’ days. Author Ralph Blum
has reinterpreted the legends con-

nected with the runes, collecting his

findings in The Book ofRunes, a working
set that includes a drawstring pouch
holding the stones and a bound
volume of history, instruction and
translation. V

Runes are cast — laid out in various
patterns — when the possessor is

doubtful, depressed or bothered with .

THE BEST OF “THE JOURNAL OF
IRREPRODUCIBLE RESULTS”
Ed. by Dr. George H. Scherr
Workman Publishing

"Apparently (with parody, one can I

never be sure), there really is a publica-
tion calling itself The Journal of Irre-
producible Results. It premiered in 1955
with the purpose of s_atirizing research
as a sort of in-joke for the scientists
themselves. Real doctors, holidaying
from their usual study, contributed arti-
cles to the periodical. I ‘
The Best of “The Journal of Irreprod-
ucible Results,” edited by Dr. George
.Scherr, brings together the, uh, best of
The Journal of Irreproducible Results,

an entertaining anthology that can be

some sort of problem requiring
action or decision. The stones are
deciphered in order, according to
their layout; each stone carries its
own message, and the completed
reading should suggest some insight.
Blum stresses that the runes do not in
themselves solve problems, they
merely provide "a bridge to your
Knowing Self” — and one must work
with their advice toward a solution.

Casting requires patience and com-
mitment, but The Book of Runes pro-
vides absorbing study, even for
skeptics. At best, the runes may help
one get in touch with himself. But
even as a game, the stones provide
neat diversion.

The humor derives from a deadpan-

The Animals were the origi-
nal rock ’n’ roll maniacs. Riding
on the crest of the mid-60s Brit-
ish Invasion, they had four Top
20 hits that were intense
rhythm 8: blues work-ov_ers.
Furthermore, they continued to
create rock classics as the inva-
sion fermented. The Animals

were one of about five groups"

during the first wave of the
British Invasion that made any
lasting impression on rock ’n’
roll. That was ‘1965.

This is 1984, and the Animals
are resurrected. They released
an album and toured behind it in

1983, and now there's an album,

However, there is a huge prob-

[A-have concluded that there are

several components essential to
being a Ramone: a leather

in the knees, timing, intensity
and the staying power of pluto-
nium. Staying power being

success.

Regardless, as is customary
with this band, it's damn the

new lp, Too Tough to Die, if given
the airplay it deserves would
probably be their commercial
breakthrough. But this record is
no sellout for the progenitors of

Dee Dee and Johny Ramone's
fondness for hardcore, which
was hinted at in last year's Sub-

unleashed on Too Tough to Die
with "Wart Hog" and "Endless

fans out there, these two cuts
are worth the price of the
album

The biggest surprise, though,
is (would you believe?) rocka-
billy, most notably in the song
”No Go." If that doesn't surprise
you, there are other songs that
will.

I won't say that this is the best

SLIP IT IN
Black Flag

ssr

With so many California
Bands on the alternative music
scene, including X and the Dead
Kennedys among others, how
could a foursome that goes by
the name of a common insecti-
cide have produced so much
successful material?

In the past, Black Flag relied
on the raw power and urgency
of Henry Rollins’ throaty voice;
fast, thrashing guitar and bass;
and the tongue-in-cheek cyni-
cism of songs like ”T V Party”
and ”Six Pack” that appealed to a
frustrated youth culture. In a
society of gooey pop songs and
”gee, I think I'm in love again”
lyrics, Black Flag has consist-
ently had something to say.

They still do. Slip It In is laced
with sarcasm and light social
commentary, but on this lp,
their presentation is more pol-
ished. While previous songs
consisted of one or two minutes
of harsh, intense emotion, Slip It
In contains four—, five-, and even

embers of The English Beat.
Dave Wakeling and Ranking
Roger, vocalist, guitarist, and
writers, respectively, for the
Beat, broke the band upa year.
ago “after three records and tre-
mendous critical and popular
success in England, their home.
The Beat was part of the ska
explosion in the late ’70s and on
the roster of Two-Tone
Records with other bands like
The Specials and Madness.
These bands, and ska itself,
were cross-bred hybrids of rock

seven-minute songs that retain
the.hardcore influence of the
past but embellish it with subtle
touches of heavy metal. The
result is a more textured ver-
sion of the trademark Black Flag
sound.

Throughout its history, the
band has undergone several
personnel changes, but vocalist
Henry Rollins and guitarist
Greg Ginn have remained an
integralpart. Ginn has played
an influential role in writing
their material in the past, and he
and Rollins wrote virtually all of
the music and lyrics on Slip It In.

”Obliteration,” an instrumen-

tal, is one of the album's best
cuts because it highlights the
fact that the members of Black

‘Flag truly are accomplished

musicians.

"With this lp, their second of
1984, the band has proven that
it is musically adept enough to
step beyond hardcore without
losing any of the guts or emo-
tion that has become its
trademark.

A desire to branch out and a

gae, ska, calypso,” dub, funk,
new wave pop and Motown
bubbles to the surface of an
‘intoxicating stew. It is a cross-
cultural experience, but unlike a
Nationalf Geographic special,
you can dance to it.--

As if so impressive a list of
influences was not enough,
General Public’s lyrics do not
bog down in the usual adoles-
.cent concerns of John ‘Waite

”Words aresocheap, but they
can turn out expensive Words
like conviction can turn into a
sentence." The churning funk
of ”Where’s The Line” asks
”Where’s the line between lust
and love" over and over again,
with the apology, ”Not really
hard, just acting tough? That's
how it seems to be." An admis-
sion that promiscuity can be
confusing? There's a new agenda
for a pop song.

The duo hasn't lost their po-
litical consciousness either. On
”Burning Bright,” which fea-
tures Mick Jones of the dis-
solved Clash, Wakeling laments
of people ”with one foot in their
mouths and one foot in their
graves” and declares, ”Don’t put
out the lights! I'm not prepared
to just sit and watch again.”
General Public’s global view is
not confined to their musical
style.

Wakeling’s vocals are deli-_
vered with quite a few styles of
their own, sometimes several
jammed into one song. Like a
flexible vacuum hose, he
squeaks‘ and honks, snaking
back and forth, or blurts with
the urgency of a machine gun.

"Matter of Fact" aptly show-
cases the band’s crazy style
shifts. Starting out with an a
capella rap, the band alternates
between frantic rhythmic sec-
tions and dreamy slower ones
with a mock radio announcer
reminiscent of McCartney's
Uncle 'AlbertIAdmiral Halsey.
The song is bona fide experi-
mental, but so rapidly paced

‘ that it avoids self-indulgence.

them. There is so much here”

that there's a flippant, off-hand
quality, as though,it's okay if
they miss their mark sometimes
with the lyric, they'll hit you

with melody, or vice versa. The ,

thing. The record feels good. It's
a goldmine —- from everywhere
in the world.

It's not pop, and it's certainly
not reggae. What is it?

Jamaican-born Denroy Mor-
gan is one of the many musi-

-cians outgthere today who touts

his reggae background but does
nothing with it.

Leaving Jamaica in 1966, he
went to'New York to found a
reggae band, The Black Eagles.
He mixed reggae with R & B.
But from this latest effort, it's
clear that he's aimed for the
mass market of pop music.

Since reggae is hitting the
international music scene, a
merge of this musical form with
others is inevitable. It can be an
exciting blend of musical tastes
and experiences. But when the
end product sounds like a
watered-down mixture of
nothing particularly inspiring, it
doesn't have much merit.

The title track shows prom-
ise. It has a funky bass backbeat
with some interesting synthes-
izer work. But theirest of the
cuts are aiming for the Top 10
AM radio.

This is reggae that's light
years away from its roots.

HUSKER DU, HALF LIFE. AND
POISONING

Graffiti

Oct. 9, 1984

_by Michael Pay

All those who made the trip out to
Graffiti last Tuesday night were
rewarded with one of the best live
performances this city has seen in a
long time. As guitarist Bob Mould
predicted before the show, Husker
Du pulled out all the stops.

Their explosive first set focused on
their earlier material —- very intense
hardcore. Selections from their latest
lp, Zen Arcade, were mixed in the set,
but the highlights were definitely the
earlier stuff, such as ”Everything
Falls Apart,” the title track from their
first Lecord.

The first set would have sent most
crowds away with smiles on their
faces. However, after a 20-minute
break, Husker Du returned to prove
that rock ’n’ roll is very much alive,
V and it spent that evening in Oakland.

After announcing that their regu-
lar set had been completed and ”this is
‘just for fun,” Mould hit the first
chord of the Beatles’ ”Ticket to Ride.”
Then, in response to the large
number of requests they had
received, they , played a medley
including inspired versions of

”What’s Goin’ On,” "Pink Turns to .

Blue," ”Eight Miles High” and the
manic masterpiece ”Diane.” But the
highlight of the show, which took
_.everyone by surprise, was a souped-
up version of Elvis Presley's ”Jail
House Rock.” The reaction on the
dance floor could be described only as
complete mania -7 a reaction not
many bands are able to elicit in this
town.

According to Mou_ld,,the secondyset

was as surprisingto the band as it was

way through a 25-song set you'd be
convinced that's all that need be said.

Not content to rely on the classics
strung throughout their four
records, the band also offered a sam-
pling of what's to come. A cowpunk
rave—up, ”Lil’ Honey,” and the searing
rock of ”What’s Wrong With Me”
gave solid evidence that X's sound is
hardly etched in stone.

Unlike most of the bands that have
emerged from L.A.’s "seminal club
scene, X has expanded their sound to
include a. wide variety ofinfluences.
This has madethe band more accessi-
ble while sacrificing little ‘of the
band's challenging stance.

In all, five new songs were included
in the set, which spread the material
out by choosing almost evenly from
the band's four records. Nothing
really stood out as spectacular, but
everything played with a certain
intensity and sincerity. Exene may, at
times, look as if she's drifting off into

 

to the crowd. ”We never played a

medley before," he said. ”That was
completely spontaneous. That was

DIANA ROSS
Civic Arena
October 7, 1984

by Stan Thomas Wozniak

Picture this: a middle-aged, plump
couple clapping "their hands and
swaying to the beat of Diana Ross’
No. 1 dance single, ”Swept Away,”
live in concert. OK, so they like to
dance. But isn't this the dominant
generation in the Civic Arena’s
audience who came to hear the
Motown Diana and songs like ”Love

Child” and ”Where Did Our Love
Go”? ‘

Maybe. Maybe not. But it was also
an audience without much of a
choice. Though Ross did medleys of
older songs, she did them as if they
were better left undone. ”Ain’t No
Mountain High Enough” had no fire,

‘”You Can't Hurry Love" no kick and

’-’Stop! In The Name’ of Love" no
excitement.
Instead, Ross paraded through the

audience, showing off her fashions

and V attempting to win over the
audience — something she could
have done very simply by staying on
stage longer and singing more effec-
tively. Her stage presence was even
more disconcerting given that there
were sound problems:

Hard-core Diana Ross fans didn't
seem to mind, though. After all, Ross,
through the sound problems, seemed
to be a professional performer who
occasionally does give off an elegance
and sophistication hard to imitate.

Under dim lights, her ballads we're”

the best (”Missing You,” a dedication
to Marvin Gaye, the film hit ”It’s My

Turn” and Bob Dylan's ”l3orever'

Young”).

Also good was a short version of
”So Close” and, although too long,
”Muscles” (”Michael [Jackson] wrote
this song for me. I don't know why”).
And, the lady's definitely looking
good (”I’m not gonna tell you how old
I am,” she laughed).

A disappointing concert overall,

J, » though. Disappointing was-the lack

of timegshe spent on stage. Disap-

. pointing was her ineffective use of

the theater-in—the-round setting.

TV, Bourbon Street beckon
spikers to New Orleans

By Laurie Kubli
The Pitt News

Bourbon Street’s festive atmos-
phere contrasts sharply with the mis-
sion of Pi_tt’s women’s volleyball
team’s ﬂight to New Orleans for the
L.S.U.-Aspri Showcase this week-
end. The squad is hoping to show the
southern folks how power volleyball
is played back east. Rice, Louisiana
State, Duke and Mississippi State
are Pitt’s opponents.

“These are some of the best teams

in the South,” stated head coach‘

Shelton Collier. “We are regarded as
one of the best teams in the East, so
as representatives of our conference
and region, it’s important for us to
play well.” V ,

The spikers have been to a match
in West Virginia and a tournament
in Tennessee this past week, with
Tuesday's WVU match providing
their only win. That victory, how-
ever, was not as crisp as it could have

Panthers

By Mark A. Sindler
The Pitt News '

If it isn't the 4-0 record that ignites
interest first, then the quiet demean-
or does. South Carolina football
coach Joe Morrison exudes that
type of character these days as his
undefeated Gamecocks ready them-
selves for the Panthers tomorrow
afternoon (12:20 p.m. kickoff) at
Williams-Brice Stadium.

Native Columbians never had rea-
sonto cheer much, except for several
bowl games back in the late '60s, but
even those all ended in losses. Go
back even further, to 1928, to record
the last time USC began such a per-
fect season (going 5-0 before losing
to Clemson that year). And the
Gamecocks are again certain that
same start can be duplicated against

been, following a hard-fought tour-
nament against highly-ranked
-teams.

Senior Cathy Rupp, whom Col-
lier says is “really establishing her-
self as a top quality setter,” believes
the team will rebound from the’ less
than satisfying Mountaineer match
and head into Louisiana with an
alert and ready-to,-play attitude.
“We left with a good practice
Wednesday after a sluggish match
-Tuesday,” Rupp remarked. “Hope-
fully, things will be on the upswing."

The four matches are spread out
over the three days, granting the
spikers more time in between con-
tests than they’ve had in their other
tournaments this season. Last week-
end in Tennessee, they played the
fifth, eighth and 17th ranked
(NCAA) teams in the country — one
on Friday night and the other two on
Saturday. In the Big East Southern
Division two weekends ago, Pitt
played three matches Saturday and
three more Sunday, which
amounted to 18 (victorious) games.

‘ “This weekend was, or should be,
made for our team,” explained

Rupp. “We have one match per day,
and two spread out ones on the other
day. This gives us plenty of time to
relax and hang out together and get
up for each match, rather than hav-

ing successive matches that can

make you tired."

Collier said that any one of four
teams have equal shots at winning
the tournament, with Mississippi
State unlikely to accomplish that.

The spikers’ first opponent hails
from Texas and has never played
Pitt. “We’ve played several teams
from Texas, and Rice is one of the
better teams from there," Collier
said. “They’ve won three of their ﬁve
tournaments and placed second in
the other two.”

Pitt will play Mississippi State
which is from the “very strong”
Southwest Conference.

The Saturday night ﬂight with
host Louisiana State is the featured
match of the tournament and will be
televised on cable TV — a first for
Pitt. The news was a surprise to
Rupp, who said that she would have
found out sooner or later anyway.

4

(1-4) to chase Gamecocks (4-0)

Pitt in preparation for a stern test in
South Bend against Notre Dame
next weekend.

But Morrison isn’t really cheering
right now. At least not publicly. Ask
him anything connected in any way
to the winning streak and his
answers are a few concise words. He
"knows that USC must still face the
Irish; undefeated Florida State and

Clemson, among others. The "wins

that may have come so soon against
Citadel, Duke, Georgia and Kansas
State may not be there against these
national powers.

“Am I surprised?” he recently
asked rhetorically about USC’s
mark. “In this business, you don’t
know what to expect. We got a
chance because of a good group of
seniors."

No, these seniors are more than

good. They dominate the starting
lineup and are as a good a reason as
any for the Gamecocks’ meteoric

start. Take, for instance, the offen-
sive line. It’s a wall of four—year men.
Even though center Tom Garner
weighs in at 246 lbs., no one else falls
below the middle 260s.

On the receiving end, the Game-
cocks employ two capable deep
threat receivers — all the Panthers
need, considering the numerous
times they’ve been victimized this

.'season aloiie. Coming off “a year in

which he led USC with 30 catches
good for 422 yards, ﬂanker Ira Hil-
lary already has 244 yards and nets
24.4 yards per reception. It was his
62-yard reception two weeks ago
against Georgia late in the game that
led to the game-winning touchdown
(l7-10). .
Complementing Hillary and the
offensive line’s massive proportions

is tight end Chris Corley (6-3, 252'

lbs.). Third on the team in receiving
yardage, Corley is an easy first down

with 16 yards per reception.

Injury-plagued quarterback Chris Jelic is once again likely to be watching when the Panthers take

, Despite a continuous drought in their ability to
score, the members of the soccer team played hard-
nosed defense and won. See page 1.6-.

A Pitt stops

“It’s tough to cover the wideouts
when the tight end is so big and
tough,” head coach Foge Fazio said
in reference to Corley.

Corley is one of 12 seniors cur-
rently starting for USC who played
against and lost to the Panthers in
1981, 42-28. They were only fresh-

ing someone of Dan Marino’s
caliber single-handedly dismember
one team, as the then-junior threw
for 346 yards and six touchdowns.

Whatever the likelihood, the two
teams might switch roles this time
around. The Gamecocks have given
up only an average 113.5 yards on
the ground and 263.5 overall. Mean-
time, Pitt has been getting 312 yards
average offense per game. Some-
thing's got to give.

“We’re going to try to control the
football as much as possible,” Mor-
rison said, as any true coach
obviously would. “If we keep the
offensive line and [Pitt quarterback
John] Congemi on the sidelines,
that’ll be a great plus for us.”

i The big bonus for Morrison so far
has been two of his four starting line-
backers. Both seniors (what else?),
Paul Vogel and James Seawright are
1-2 in heading up the Gamecocks’
tackle department. Between Vogel's
38 and Seawright’s 32, though, only
seven of those have been unassisted.
But they're fast. Seawright’s 4.5 in
the 40 is tops among those on the
unit and Vogel is a hair behind,
clocking a 4.6 timing.

While a couple of other seniors
dot the defensive line's front four,
it’s basically been a trio or juniors
that has operated USC’s split-back,
option-oriented Veer offense. For
some still-confusing reason, USC
tagged a “Search for a Quarterback”
campaign during fall drills as no less
than four candidates lobbied for the
position. Everyone knew Allen
Mitchell would win out. He had the
experience and savvy after coming
off the bench behind 14-0 against
Duke last year, and passed for 240

yards and two touchdowns to beat
the Blue Devils 31-24.

Mitchell’s doing it again, pres-
ently hitting on 61.5 percent of his
passes attempted, picking up 485
yards in the process. Behind him are
backs Thomas Dendy (nearly ﬁve
yards per carry) and Kent Hagood
(second on the team with 203 yards
and 7.8 yards per carry).

“They’ll probe around you,”
Fazio said of USC’s initial tenden-
cies on offense, “then break a big one
on you.” ’

The subdued coach, in his second
year at USC after an illustrious 14-
year stint with the NF L's New York
Giants, was asked whether it mat-
tered who scored first tomorrow
afternoon. “I hope we score,” he said
solemnly. .

GRID BITS: Last year, Morrison
led the Gamecocks to a 5-6 finish,
including a victory over the West
Coast's USC, Southern Cal, 38-14.

All-America tackle Bill Fralic’s
brother Mike was a two-year letter-
man as an offensive tackle for the
Gamecocks in 1976 and 1977.

In its first four home games at
Williams-Brice, USC has averaged
70,234 fans per game.

Morrison is 71-50-5 in his 11th
year of coaching.

The Katz Network will broadcast
the game up and down the Eastern
seaboard with Curt Gowdy calling
the play-by-play alongside color
analyst Len Dawson.

The Slippery Rock squad is unde-

good challenge for us, not only
because of their undefeated record,
but also because of their edge in
experience.” This, coupled with the
fact that the Rocket runners are run-

how we have progressed.”

and dld not know what effect it
would have on her team.

Collier thinks it will be exciting
and have a positive effect. “L.S.U.’s
womens’ sports program is highly
developed. There will be a big-time
atmosphere, and they are very
strong and respected nationally. It’s
something new, and it should be
exciting." ’ ..

Duke, which is stationed in North
Carolina, is rated No.-1 the Atlantic
Coast Conference. “Our scouting
report indicates that they have a real
complicated offense, with a lot of
quick sets and deception, so that will
be a real ‘challenge for our blockers
and our defense,” Collier said.

“How the other team plays has a
lot to do with how successful you
are,” Collier continued. “How
strong they are defensively affects
your offense. It’s like football. You
are more successful running plays
against a weak defensive team. Sim-
ilarly, in baseball a hitter will be able
to hit better off of a pitcher that’s not
strong.”

Collier said that serving is gener-

ally the strongest part _of the team's.
game, but that it hasn’t been up to
par, with the possible exception of
junior Sally Gillespie. In addition,
middle blockers Ulana Kohutiak
and Sue Hoover have been carrying
the majority of the spiking load.
This weekend, however, the outside
hitters — Kris Wexell, Pat Belcher,
Louise O’Shaughnessy, and Krista
Zeiner — will be relied upon more <
heavily. ’
' “We hope that two or three of the
outside hitters will~ have a strong
tournament, in terms of their spik-
ing efficiency. This will make us a
well—rounded team. Our goal is to
win the tournament,” Collier
asserted, “and I think we have a le-
gitimate shot at it.”

Once again, the Panthers were
victorious as they defeated their
opponent, Youngstown State, 1-0
on Wednesday evening. However,

‘. - their continued inability to score

caused the game's ﬁnal outcome to
be closer than it should have been.
“It was a good win. But we had
ample opportunity to score, and we
' just couldn't put them in,”explained
Coach Luxbacher. “We should have
been able to pull ahead early in the
game, but we didn't shoot well. We
missed easy goals.”
Pitt's winning goal was scored by

The'Pitt ‘_News,. Friday, October 12, 1984

freshman Scott Reimer, a graduate
of Freedom High School in Bethle-
hem, Pa. His first collegiate goal
came off a direct kick. After Victor
Hugo's shot was denied by the oppo-
nent's goalie, Reimer manipulated
the rebound for a score.

“I'm happy that we won,” said
Reimer, who's been starting in the
past few games, “but we didn't play
well, and we’re going to have to play
harder this weekend if we expect to
beat West Virginia."

One might expect that the team's
inability to score would put added
pressure on the defense, but tri-
captain Brian Casey, who plays left
defensive fullback, denies this.
“We've had four out of nine shutouts
this season, and the only way a team
will score on us is if we make a pure

  Booters slip past Youngstown St.

mental mistake. The same five play-
ers have been back on the defensive
line all season, and we play well
together. As far as scoring goes,
we’ve been telling each other all sea-
son that if we relax, it'll come, and
we'll just have to wait and see if it
comes by this weekend."

“West Virginia is a very strong
team, and Pitt hasn't defeated them
in the past few years," explains
Luxbacher, “so we'll have to play a
fantastic defensive game and hope
we have better luck at scoring.”

Pitt faces West Virginia on Satur-
day, Oct. 13, which is Youth Soccer
Day. All members of youth and high
school soccer teams wearing team
jackets or jerseys will be admitted
for free by registering at Gate 10 of
Pitt Stadium prior to the start of the
match.

_ NCAA FOOTBALL

NEW YORK (UPI) — This
weekend's college football sched-
ule showcases the two top teams

I in the nation. Top-ranked Texas

and No. 2 Oklahoma square off
in Dallas in a battle for the No. 1
ranking.

Texas coach Fred Akers is
expecting a different style of
game from last year. Akers cited

. the play of Oklahoma quarter-

back Danny Bradley as a main
improvement in the Sooner
attack from last year. Akers says
that Bradley is throwing the ball
well, which gives the’ Sooners
“versatility.”

Oklahoma coach Barry
Switzer contends that he still
isn't sure just how good the

Sooners really are, but he
expects to find out this weekend.
Many observers believe that
Saturday's winner will have to be
considered the team to beat for
the National Championship.
